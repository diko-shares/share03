00:00:29.064 --> 00:00:32.801
- (suspenseful music playing)
- (rain pattering)

2
00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.347
(violent whooshing)

3
00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:54.589
(erupting)

4
00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:58.426
(disembodied rhythmic stomping)

5
00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:00.494
(music intensifying)

6
00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:05.533
(stomping intensifying)

7
00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:16.178
- (stomping stops)
- (exhales)

8
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:18.446
(pensive music playing)

9
00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.514
GORDON GRAY: Dr. Oppenheimer.

10
00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:22.717
Dr. Oppenheimer.

11
00:01:24.052 --> 00:01:25.653
As we begin, I believe you have

12
00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.688
a statement to read
into the record.

13
00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:30.725
Yes, Your Honor.

14
00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:32.861
WARD EVANS: We're
not judges, Doctor.

15
00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:33.929
ROBERT: No.

16
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.430
Of course.

17
00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:44.572
Members of the security board,

18
00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.909
the so-called
derogatory information

19
00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:49.845
in your indictment of me
cannot be fairly understood,

20
00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:53.714
except in the context
of my life and my work.

21
00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:56.919
SENATE AIDE: How
long did he testify?

22
00:01:56.952 --> 00:01:58.686
Honestly, I forget.

23
00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:02.057
The whole hearing took a month.

24
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.524
An ordeal, hmm?

25
00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:05.227
Well, I've only read
the transcripts.

26
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.727
(clears throat)

27
00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:09.530
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

28
00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:10.798
You weren't there?

29
00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:13.135
As chairman, I
wasn't allowed to be.

30
00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:15.736
Are they really going
to ask about it?

31
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.873
- It was years ago.
- Four years ago...

32
00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:18.941
Five.

33
00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:21.542
Oppenheimer still
divides America.

34
00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.946
The committee is gonna want
to know where you stood.

35
00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:26.081
Senator Thurmond asked me to say

36
00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:27.950
not to feel that
you're on trial.

37
00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:31.519
Oh, funny, I didn't
till you just said that.

38
00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:33.155
- Really, Mr. Strauss...
- It's Admiral.

39
00:02:33.188 --> 00:02:36.124
Um, Admiral Strauss.
This is a formality.

40
00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:38.659
President Eisenhower has asked
you to be in his cabinet.

41
00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.561
Senate really has no
choice but to confirm you.

42
00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:42.831
And if they bring
up Oppenheimer?

43
00:02:42.864 --> 00:02:45.233
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
you answer honestly.

44
00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:47.668
No senator can deny
you did your duty.

45
00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:49.838
It'll be uncomfortable.
(chuckles awkwardly)

46
00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:52.007
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

47
00:02:53.108 --> 00:02:54.742
(clamoring)

48
00:02:56.945 --> 00:02:59.647
ROGER ROBB: Why did you
leave the United States?

49
00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.153
I, uh... I wanted to
study the new physics.

50
00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:06.721
GRAY: Was there nowhere here?

51
00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:08.756
I thought Berkeley
had the leading

52
00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.624
theoretical physics department.

53
00:03:10.658 --> 00:03:13.228
Yes. Once I built it.

54
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:14.863
But first I had to go to Europe.

55
00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:18.266
I went to Cambridge to study
under Patrick Blackett.

56
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.902
Were you happier
there than in America?

57
00:03:20.936 --> 00:03:23.071
- Happier?
- Yes.

58
00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:25.639
(unsettling music playing)

59
00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:30.045
No. No, I, uh...

60
00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:34.883
<i>I was homesick, um...</i>

61
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.718
emotionally immature...

62
00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:44.026
<i>troubled by visions
of a hidden universe.</i>

63
00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.526
(soft blast)

64
00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:50.832
(rumbling)

65
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.905
Useless in the lab.

66
00:03:56.938 --> 00:03:58.539
(glass shattering)

67
00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:04.046
Christ, Oppenheimer.

68
00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.148
Have you had any sleep?

69
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.184
Start again.

70
00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:11.719
I need to go to
the lecture, sir.

71
00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:13.155
Why?

72
00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:15.090
It's Niels Bohr.

73
00:04:17.893 --> 00:04:19.593
BLACKETT: Damn,
completely forgot.

74
00:04:19.627 --> 00:04:21.830
All right. (clears
throat) Let's go.

75
00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:26.077
- Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.
- (students laughing)

76
00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:27.211
You finish coating those plates.

77
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.071
STUDENT 1: You see them?

78
00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:30.906
(students laughing)

79
00:04:34.642 --> 00:04:36.610
STUDENT 2: Don't
forget to clean up!

80
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.139
(cabinet door closes)

81
00:05:07.775 --> 00:05:11.712
BOHR: <i>Quantum physics
is not a step forward,</i>

82
00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:15.250
it is a new way to
understand reality.

83
00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:18.854
Einstein's opened the door,
now we are peering through,

84
00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:21.789
seeing a world inside our world.

85
00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:27.229
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

86
00:05:28.864 --> 00:05:31.867
(unsettling music continues)

87
00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:37.638
(rumbling)

88
00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:59.693
- (music fades out)
- (bell tolling)

89
00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:05.200
(indistinct chatter)

90
00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:10.771
Yeah, definitely.

91
00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:12.174
- (panting)
- Are you all right?

92
00:06:13.408 --> 00:06:15.243
Niels, meet J.
Robert Oppenheimer.

93
00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:16.777
BOHR: What's the
"J" stand for?

94
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:18.779
Nothing, apparently.

95
00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:19.915
You were at my lecture.

96
00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:21.349
You asked the only
good question.

97
00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:23.118
BLACKETT: No one's
denying his insight.

98
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:25.229
It's his laboratory work that
leaves a little to be desired.

99
00:06:25.253 --> 00:06:27.093
(swallows) I heard you
give the same lecture...

100
00:06:27.122 --> 00:06:30.325
At Harvard, yes, and you
asked the same question.

101
00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:31.459
Why ask again?

102
00:06:31.493 --> 00:06:33.094
Hadn't liked your answer.

103
00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:36.198
Did you like it
better yesterday?

104
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:37.499
A lot.

105
00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:39.434
You can lift the stone
without being ready

106
00:06:39.467 --> 00:06:41.836
for the snake that's revealed.

107
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.005
Now it seems you're ready.

108
00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.341
- But you don't enjoy the lab?
- (continues panting)

109
00:06:46.374 --> 00:06:49.244
So get out of Cambridge with
its beakers and potions.

110
00:06:49.277 --> 00:06:52.247
Go somewhere they let you think.

111
00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:54.883
(whispers): Where?

112
00:06:55.517 --> 00:06:56.518
Göttingen.

113
00:06:56.551 --> 00:06:58.486
- Born?
- Born.

114
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.488
Get to Germany,
study under Max Born.

115
00:07:00.522 --> 00:07:03.158
Learn the ways of theory.

116
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:04.226
I'll send word.

117
00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:05.827
(gasps)

118
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.963
- Wormhole. (exhales)
- (apple clatters in trashcan)

119
00:07:07.996 --> 00:07:09.364
How's your mathematics?

120
00:07:09.397 --> 00:07:11.366
Not good enough for the
physicist he wants to be.

121
00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:13.969
Algebra's like sheet music.

122
00:07:14.002 --> 00:07:16.471
The important thing isn't
"Can you read music?"

123
00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:17.505
It's "Can you hear it?"

124
00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.842
Can you hear the music, Robert?

125
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.378
Yes, I can.

126
00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:25.947
(classical music playing)

127
00:07:28.116 --> 00:07:30.784
- (rumbling)
- (metallic clinking)

128
00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:35.290
(music intensifying)

129
00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.061
(intense classical
music continues)

130
00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:20.201
(rumbling)

131
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:36.217
(rumbling)

132
00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:43.358
(music tempo increasing)

133
00:08:58.239 --> 00:08:59.074
(music ends)

134
00:08:59.107 --> 00:09:00.608
The senator from Wyoming.

135
00:09:01.576 --> 00:09:04.045
Admiral Strauss, I'm
interested in your relationship

136
00:09:04.079 --> 00:09:06.948
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

137
00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:08.583
You met him in 1947?

138
00:09:08.616 --> 00:09:09.584
Correct.

139
00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:11.386
You were commissioner

140
00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:12.987
of the Atomic Energy Commission?

141
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:16.958
I was, but I-I actually
met Robert in my capacity

142
00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:19.661
as board member of the
Institute for Advanced Study

143
00:09:19.694 --> 00:09:21.496
at Princeton because

144
00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:24.165
after the war, he
was world-renowned

145
00:09:24.199 --> 00:09:26.601
as the great man of physics,
and I was determined

146
00:09:26.634 --> 00:09:29.337
to get him to run the Institute.

147
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:31.473
(birds chirping)

148
00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:34.175
(soft music playing)

149
00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:41.583
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

150
00:09:41.616 --> 00:09:42.951
Mr. Strauss.

151
00:09:42.984 --> 00:09:44.285
It's pronounced "straws."

152
00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:46.654
ROBERT: Oh-ppenheimer,
Oppenheimer.

153
00:09:46.688 --> 00:09:48.556
Whatever way you say it,
they know I'm Jewish.

154
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.058
(Strauss chuckles)

155
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.694
I'm president of Temple
Emanu-El in Manhattan.

156
00:09:52.727 --> 00:09:54.996
"Straws" is just the
Southern pronunciation.

157
00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:56.064
- Ah.
- Anyway,

158
00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:57.532
welcome to the Institute.

159
00:09:57.565 --> 00:09:59.200
I think you could
be very happy here.

160
00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:01.169
Yes, well, you'll
love the commute.

161
00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.537
The position comes
with that house

162
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.038
for you and your wife

163
00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:06.241
and your, is it two children?

164
00:10:06.274 --> 00:10:07.075
Yes, two.

165
00:10:07.108 --> 00:10:10.044
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

166
00:10:10.078 --> 00:10:12.280
And you're a physicist
by training, Mr. Strauss?

167
00:10:12.313 --> 00:10:14.382
I'm sorry, uh,
common room 4:00 tea.

168
00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:17.185
No, I'm not trained in
physics or anything else.

169
00:10:17.218 --> 00:10:19.053
- I'm a self-made man.
- Ah.

170
00:10:19.087 --> 00:10:21.089
- I can relate to that.
- Really?

171
00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:23.458
Yes, my father was one.

172
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:27.061
And this would be your office.

173
00:10:36.237 --> 00:10:38.173
I'm told he's there
most afternoons.

174
00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:40.308
You know, I've always wondered

175
00:10:40.341 --> 00:10:43.945
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

176
00:10:44.712 --> 00:10:48.216
Greatest scientific
mind of our time.

177
00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:50.118
Of his time.

178
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:52.187
Einstein published his
Theory of Relativity

179
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.156
more than 40 years ago now.

180
00:10:56.224 --> 00:10:58.660
But never embraced the
quantum world it revealed.

181
00:10:58.693 --> 00:11:00.228
"God doesn't play dice."

182
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.230
Precisely.

183
00:11:02.263 --> 00:11:05.066
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

184
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:07.469
Well, I had offers, but
I chose to sell shoes.

185
00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:11.005
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

186
00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:13.675
No, just a shoe salesman.

187
00:11:13.708 --> 00:11:15.977
Huh.

188
00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:20.014
- I'd love to introduce you.
- No need.

189
00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:22.584
I have known him for years.

190
00:11:29.157 --> 00:11:31.559
(soft music continues)

191
00:11:43.806 --> 00:11:45.507
Albert.

192
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.576
(pensive music playing)

193
00:11:50.111 --> 00:11:54.315
What was that? What
did you say to him?

194
00:11:56.451 --> 00:11:57.485
Oh, he's fine.

195
00:11:59.354 --> 00:12:02.657
Mr. Strauss, there
are things in my past

196
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.192
you ought to be aware of.

197
00:12:04.225 --> 00:12:06.127
Well, as chairman of the AEC,

198
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.629
I have access to
your security file.

199
00:12:07.662 --> 00:12:08.663
I've read it.

200
00:12:08.696 --> 00:12:10.265
- You're not worried?
- No.

201
00:12:10.298 --> 00:12:11.675
Why would I be worried
after everything

202
00:12:11.699 --> 00:12:13.167
you've done for your country?

203
00:12:13.201 --> 00:12:14.669
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

204
00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:16.538
Well, the purpose
of this institute

205
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.240
is to provide a haven
for independent minds.

206
00:12:20.174 --> 00:12:23.177
That's you. You are
the man for the job.

207
00:12:23.211 --> 00:12:25.814
Well, then I'll consider it.

208
00:12:25.848 --> 00:12:28.116
I'll see you at the
AEC meeting tomorrow.

209
00:12:31.419 --> 00:12:32.487
(scoffs)

210
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.088
This is one of the
most prestigious

211
00:12:34.122 --> 00:12:35.858
appointments in the country.

212
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:38.092
Yes, with a great commute.

213
00:12:38.126 --> 00:12:40.428
That's why I'm considering it.

214
00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:42.230
SENATOR McGEE: <i>So,
Dr. Oppenheimer brought</i>

215
00:12:42.263 --> 00:12:44.666
<i>your attention to
his past associations</i>

216
00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:45.834
<i>before you appointed him?</i>

217
00:12:45.868 --> 00:12:47.302
Yes.

218
00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:49.170
And it didn't concern you?

219
00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:50.738
Just then, I was
entirely consumed

220
00:12:50.772 --> 00:12:54.542
with what he must have said
to Einstein to sour him on me.

221
00:12:54.576 --> 00:12:57.078
(laughter)

222
00:12:58.146 --> 00:12:59.347
But later?

223
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.316
Well, we all know
what happened later.

224
00:13:01.349 --> 00:13:03.718
ROBB: Doctor, your, uh...
your time in Europe,

225
00:13:03.751 --> 00:13:05.320
you seemed to meet
with a wide range

226
00:13:05.353 --> 00:13:06.788
of other countries' physicists.

227
00:13:06.822 --> 00:13:07.823
Yes, that's right.

228
00:13:07.856 --> 00:13:10.124
Any Russians?

229
00:13:11.192 --> 00:13:12.627
None that spring to mind.

230
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.563
If you'll just allow me to
continue with my statement...

231
00:13:15.597 --> 00:13:18.566
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample
opportunity to cross-examine.

232
00:13:20.803 --> 00:13:23.738
ROBERT: After Göttingen, I
moved on to Leiden in Holland

233
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:26.809
<i>where I first met Isidor Rabi.</i>

234
00:13:26.842 --> 00:13:29.344
(clears throat) Excuse me.

235
00:13:29.377 --> 00:13:30.478
(grunts)

236
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.247
(sighs)

237
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:35.617
A Yank, lecturing
on the new physics?

238
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.718
This I have to hear.

239
00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:38.786
I'm an American myself.

240
00:13:38.821 --> 00:13:40.321
How surprising.

241
00:13:40.355 --> 00:13:41.422
Um...

242
00:13:41.456 --> 00:13:43.725
Let me know if you need
any help with the English.

243
00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:48.162
(scattered laughter)

244
00:13:50.732 --> 00:13:53.401
(speaking Dutch)

245
00:13:57.705 --> 00:13:59.674
Wait, what's he saying?

246
00:14:02.777 --> 00:14:05.279
(door opens)

247
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.283
(Rabi grunts)

248
00:14:10.218 --> 00:14:11.252
No, thank you.

249
00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:13.254
It's a long way to Zurich.

250
00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:14.927
You get any skinnier,
we're gonna lose you

251
00:14:14.957 --> 00:14:16.791
between the seat cushions.

252
00:14:16.825 --> 00:14:17.860
I'm Rabi.

253
00:14:17.893 --> 00:14:19.260
Oppenheimer.

254
00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:21.329
I caught your
lecture on molecules.

255
00:14:21.362 --> 00:14:22.497
Caught some of it.

256
00:14:23.631 --> 00:14:25.800
We're a couple of New York
Jews. How do you know Dutch?

257
00:14:25.834 --> 00:14:27.402
Well, I thought
I'd better learn it

258
00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:28.612
when I got here this semester.

259
00:14:28.636 --> 00:14:30.238
You learned enough
Dutch in six weeks

260
00:14:30.271 --> 00:14:31.974
to give a lecture on
quantum mechanics?

261
00:14:32.007 --> 00:14:33.508
Wanted to challenge myself.

262
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.911
Quantum physics wasn't
challenging enough.

263
00:14:35.944 --> 00:14:37.679
<i>- Schvitzer.
- Schvitzer?</i>

264
00:14:37.712 --> 00:14:39.614
- Show-off.
- (chuckles)

265
00:14:39.647 --> 00:14:41.492
Dutch in six weeks, but
you never learned Yiddish?

266
00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:43.584
They don't speak it so
much my side of the park.

267
00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:44.686
Screw you.

268
00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:47.288
You homesick?

269
00:14:47.321 --> 00:14:48.723
Oh, you know it.

270
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:52.694
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

271
00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:53.795
Physicists?

272
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:55.329
'S funny.

273
00:14:55.363 --> 00:14:57.432
Not in the department.

274
00:14:57.465 --> 00:14:58.766
They're all Jewish too.

275
00:15:00.869 --> 00:15:02.270
Eat.

276
00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:06.708
There's a German you
have to seek out.

277
00:15:07.742 --> 00:15:10.278
- Heisenberg.
- Right.

278
00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:14.682
(Heisenberg speaking German)

279
00:15:19.454 --> 00:15:20.956
One might be led
to the presumption

280
00:15:20.989 --> 00:15:23.458
that behind the quantum world,

281
00:15:23.491 --> 00:15:27.361
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

282
00:15:27.395 --> 00:15:29.597
but such speculation seem to us,

283
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.366
to say it explicitly,
fruitless. Thank you.

284
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.836
Have a great day.

285
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:39.007
(indistinct chatter)

286
00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:40.742
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

287
00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:42.010
Dr. Oppenheimer.

288
00:15:42.044 --> 00:15:43.979
Oppenheimer, yes.

289
00:15:44.012 --> 00:15:45.881
I liked your paper on molecules.

290
00:15:45.914 --> 00:15:47.415
Probably because
you inspired it.

291
00:15:47.448 --> 00:15:48.960
If I inspire anything
else, let me know.

292
00:15:48.984 --> 00:15:50.024
We could publish together.

293
00:15:50.052 --> 00:15:51.887
I have to get back to America.

294
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.654
Why? There's no one there

295
00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:55.891
taking quantum
mechanics seriously.

296
00:15:55.924 --> 00:15:57.525
- That's exactly why.
- (sighs)

297
00:15:57.558 --> 00:15:59.995
He's pining for the
canyons of Manhattan.

298
00:16:00.028 --> 00:16:02.463
ROBERT: Canyons of New Mexico.

299
00:16:02.497 --> 00:16:03.640
- You're from New Mexico?
- No.

300
00:16:03.664 --> 00:16:05.767
New York, but my brother
and I have a ranch

301
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.903
outside Santa Fe. (inhales)

302
00:16:07.936 --> 00:16:10.304
That's the America
I miss right now.

303
00:16:10.338 --> 00:16:12.406
Then it's best you
get home, cowboys.

304
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.052
- (Robert chuckles)
- (chuckles) That's him.

305
00:16:14.076 --> 00:16:17.512
No, me and horses.
I don't think so.

306
00:16:17.545 --> 00:16:19.680
- (Rabi chuckles)
- Nice to meet you.

307
00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:23.551
Did you ever encounter
Heisenberg again?

308
00:16:23.584 --> 00:16:26.487
Not in person, no, but, uh...

309
00:16:27.722 --> 00:16:29.825
you might say our paths crossed.

310
00:16:31.392 --> 00:16:33.594
On returning to America,
I accepted positions

311
00:16:33.628 --> 00:16:36.364
at both Caltech
and up at Berkeley.

312
00:16:36.397 --> 00:16:38.599
(indistinct chatter)

313
00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:41.702
WOMAN: I got it,
it's all right.

314
00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.839
(mellow music playing)

315
00:17:00.421 --> 00:17:02.456
ROBERT: Dr. Lawrence,
I presume?

316
00:17:03.859 --> 00:17:05.093
You must be Oppenheimer.

317
00:17:05.127 --> 00:17:06.661
Yes.

318
00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:09.031
I hear you want to start a
school of quantum theory.

319
00:17:09.064 --> 00:17:10.731
I am starting it. Next door.

320
00:17:10.765 --> 00:17:12.600
- They put you in there?
- I asked for it.

321
00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:14.702
Wanted to be close to
you experimentalists.

322
00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:17.105
Theory will get you
only so far, huh?

323
00:17:17.139 --> 00:17:19.107
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

324
00:17:19.141 --> 00:17:21.844
- Magnificent.
- Would you like to help?

325
00:17:21.877 --> 00:17:23.711
Build it? Oh, no. (chuckles)

326
00:17:23.744 --> 00:17:24.847
No, no.

327
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.448
But I am working on theories
I'd like to test with it.

328
00:17:27.481 --> 00:17:28.492
When do you start teaching?

329
00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:30.384
I've got my first in an hour.

330
00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:32.420
- Seminar?
- Pupil.

331
00:17:32.453 --> 00:17:35.690
One student? That's it?

332
00:17:35.723 --> 00:17:38.459
I'm teaching something no
one here has dreamt of.

333
00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.504
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it...

334
00:17:40.528 --> 00:17:41.997
There's no going back.

335
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.132
(door opens)

336
00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:46.467
- Oh. I must have missed the...
- Ah. Lo...

337
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.502
- Mr. Lomanitz?
- Na.

338
00:17:49.704 --> 00:17:50.605
Yeah.

339
00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:52.740
Yes, this is it. Please.

340
00:17:52.773 --> 00:17:53.842
Take a seat.

341
00:17:54.977 --> 00:17:56.377
(clears throat)

342
00:17:58.713 --> 00:18:00.514
What do you know about
quantum mechanics?

343
00:18:00.548 --> 00:18:02.918
I have a grasp on the basics.

344
00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:04.518
Then you're doing it wrong.

345
00:18:04.552 --> 00:18:05.720
(classical music playing)

346
00:18:05.753 --> 00:18:08.023
Is light made up of
particles or waves?

347
00:18:08.056 --> 00:18:09.200
Quantum mechanics
says it's both.

348
00:18:09.224 --> 00:18:10.826
How could it be both?

349
00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:12.760
- It can't.
- It can't.

350
00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:17.665
But it is. It's paradoxical,
and yet, it works.

351
00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:25.807
Now.

352
00:18:27.675 --> 00:18:29.644
Thank you.

353
00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:32.680
Mr. Lomanitz. You're
gonna be okay.

354
00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:34.082
Mr. Snyder.

355
00:18:34.116 --> 00:18:35.650
Now let's consider a star.

356
00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:39.221
A star. A vast furnace
burning in outer space,

357
00:18:39.254 --> 00:18:42.657
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

358
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.126
Balanced.

359
00:18:44.159 --> 00:18:46.460
But if that furnace cools...

360
00:18:46.494 --> 00:18:47.795
(crackling)

361
00:18:47.829 --> 00:18:49.831
and gravity starts
winning, it contracts.

362
00:18:50.832 --> 00:18:51.799
Density increases.

363
00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:53.035
Correct.

364
00:18:53.068 --> 00:18:54.236
Increasing gravity.

365
00:18:54.269 --> 00:18:55.770
Increasing density.

366
00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:57.940
- And?
- It's a vicious cycle until...

367
00:18:57.973 --> 00:18:59.607
what's the limit here?

368
00:19:00.775 --> 00:19:03.011
(chuckles) I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

369
00:19:03.045 --> 00:19:04.822
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

370
00:19:04.846 --> 00:19:06.747
Me?

371
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:08.951
Yes, you. Your math
is better than mine.

372
00:19:08.984 --> 00:19:10.651
(students laughing)

373
00:19:10.685 --> 00:19:12.787
SENATOR BARTLETT:
<i>Dr. Oppenheimer's file</i>

374
00:19:12.821 --> 00:19:15.223
<i>contained detail of his
activities in Berkeley.</i>

375
00:19:15.257 --> 00:19:16.724
Why would they
have started a file

376
00:19:16.757 --> 00:19:19.694
on Dr. Oppenheimer
before the war?

377
00:19:19.727 --> 00:19:22.197
Well, you'd have
to ask Mr. Hoover.

378
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.099
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

379
00:19:24.132 --> 00:19:27.069
Uh, my assumption is that

380
00:19:27.102 --> 00:19:30.238
it was connected to his, uh,

381
00:19:30.272 --> 00:19:32.808
left-wing political activities.

382
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:35.585
LAWRENCE: You shouldn't
let them bring up politics

383
00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:36.945
in the classroom, Oppie.

384
00:19:36.979 --> 00:19:38.713
I wrote that.

385
00:19:38.746 --> 00:19:42.017
Lawrence, you embrace the
revolution in physics.

386
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.852
Can't you see it
everywhere else?

387
00:19:43.885 --> 00:19:45.988
Picasso, Stravinsky,
Freud, Marx.

388
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:47.621
LAWRENCE: Well, this
is America, Oppie.

389
00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:49.024
We had our revolution.

390
00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:52.660
Seriously, keep
it out of the lab.

391
00:19:52.693 --> 00:19:55.796
Well, out of the
lab, my landlady

392
00:19:55.831 --> 00:19:58.632
is having a discussion
group tonight. Interested?

393
00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:00.735
I have sampled the
Berkeley political scene.

394
00:20:00.768 --> 00:20:02.804
It's all just
philosophy post-grads

395
00:20:02.838 --> 00:20:05.140
and Communists
talking integration.

396
00:20:05.173 --> 00:20:06.842
You don't care
about integration.

397
00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:08.743
I want to vote for
it, not talk about it.

398
00:20:08.776 --> 00:20:10.778
'Specially on a Friday.
Come on, let's eat.

399
00:20:10.812 --> 00:20:13.148
(sighs) I'm meeting
my brother there.

400
00:20:13.181 --> 00:20:15.059
SENATOR BARTLETT: <i>And how
would these activities</i>

401
00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:16.218
<i>have come to the attention</i>

402
00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:17.252
of the FBI?

403
00:20:17.285 --> 00:20:19.254
Well, if I remember correctly,

404
00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:21.223
the FBI was taking
license plates

405
00:20:21.256 --> 00:20:23.591
outside suspected
Communist gatherings,

406
00:20:23.624 --> 00:20:25.626
<i>and his name popped up.</i>

407
00:20:33.201 --> 00:20:34.735
- Gotcha!
- (whispers): Jesus Christ.

408
00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:37.072
- Sorry. Hi, brother.
- Frank.

409
00:20:38.073 --> 00:20:39.808
Uh, you remember Jackie.

410
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:41.309
Evening.

411
00:20:41.343 --> 00:20:43.311
Let's go. Come.

412
00:20:43.345 --> 00:20:45.914
MAN: Right over there,
right over there.

413
00:20:46.848 --> 00:20:49.851
Robert. I want you
to meet Chevalier.

414
00:20:49.885 --> 00:20:53.587
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

415
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:54.789
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

416
00:20:54.823 --> 00:20:56.124
This is my little
brother, Frank.

417
00:20:56.158 --> 00:20:57.359
- And this is...
- Hello.

418
00:20:57.392 --> 00:20:59.327
- Still Jackie.
- Hello, Still Jackie.

419
00:20:59.361 --> 00:21:01.329
Chevalier, you're in languages?

420
00:21:01.363 --> 00:21:03.098
And your reputation
precedes you.

421
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:04.866
- What have you heard?
- MARY: Excuse me.

422
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.676
That you're teaching a radical
new approach to physics

423
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.945
I have no chance
of understanding,

424
00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:09.347
but I hadn't heard
you're a Party member.

425
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:11.672
- Uh, I'm not.
- Oh, not yet.

426
00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:13.683
Frank and I are thinking of
joining. Just the other day,

427
00:21:13.707 --> 00:21:15.353
- I was saying...
- I support a range of causes.

428
00:21:15.377 --> 00:21:17.012
CHEVALIER: The
Spanish Civil War?

429
00:21:17.045 --> 00:21:18.779
A democratic republic
being overthrown

430
00:21:18.814 --> 00:21:20.115
by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

431
00:21:20.148 --> 00:21:21.817
Our government.

432
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.327
They think that socialism is
a bigger threat than fascism.

433
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:24.853
ROBERT: Not for long.

434
00:21:24.886 --> 00:21:26.687
Look at what the Nazis
are doing to the Jews.

435
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.291
I send funds to colleagues
in Germany to emigrate.

436
00:21:29.324 --> 00:21:31.359
I have to do something.

437
00:21:31.393 --> 00:21:34.762
(sighs) My own work
is so abstract.

438
00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:36.364
What are you working on?

439
00:21:36.398 --> 00:21:38.333
What happens to the
stars when they die.

440
00:21:38.366 --> 00:21:39.800
Do stars die?

441
00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:42.304
Well, if they do,

442
00:21:42.337 --> 00:21:44.239
they'd cool, then collapse.

443
00:21:44.272 --> 00:21:46.908
In fact, the bigger the star,

444
00:21:46.942 --> 00:21:49.643
<i>- the more violent its demise.</i>
- (explosions)

445
00:21:49.677 --> 00:21:51.213
The gravity gets so concentrated

446
00:21:51.246 --> 00:21:54.216
it swallows everything.

447
00:21:54.249 --> 00:21:55.217
Everything, even light.

448
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.418
Can that really happen?

449
00:21:56.451 --> 00:21:58.253
The math says it can.

450
00:21:58.286 --> 00:21:59.720
If we can get published,

451
00:21:59.753 --> 00:22:01.332
then perhaps one day,
an astronomer finds one.

452
00:22:01.356 --> 00:22:03.091
But right now, all
I have is theory,

453
00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:04.993
which can't impact
people's lives.

454
00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:07.295
Well, if you're going
to send money to Spain,

455
00:22:07.329 --> 00:22:08.897
do it through the
Communist Party.

456
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.274
They can get it to
the front lines.

457
00:22:10.298 --> 00:22:12.700
Mary sent me with these.

458
00:22:13.401 --> 00:22:16.204
- I'm Jean.
- Robert.

459
00:22:16.238 --> 00:22:17.738
CHEVALIER: Haakon Chevalier.

460
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:19.317
The union meeting at
Serber's last month?

461
00:22:19.341 --> 00:22:20.741
Right, right, yes.

462
00:22:20.774 --> 00:22:22.144
Oh, thank you.

463
00:22:22.177 --> 00:22:24.412
CHEVALIER: Robert here
says he's not a Communist.

464
00:22:24.446 --> 00:22:26.747
Well, then he doesn't
know enough about it.

465
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.151
Oh, I've read <i>Das Kapital,</i>
all three volumes.

466
00:22:29.184 --> 00:22:30.819
Does that count?

467
00:22:30.852 --> 00:22:32.830
It would make you better
read than most party members.

468
00:22:32.854 --> 00:22:35.157
Turgid stuff. There's
some thinking, um,

469
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.358
"Ownership is theft."

470
00:22:36.391 --> 00:22:38.293
- "Property."
- "Property"?

471
00:22:38.326 --> 00:22:40.128
"Property," not "ownership."

472
00:22:40.162 --> 00:22:42.197
I'm sorry, I read it
in the original German.

473
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.900
CHEVALIER: (chuckles) Well.

474
00:22:45.766 --> 00:22:47.135
It's not about the book.

475
00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:50.172
It's about the ideas. And
you sound uncommitted.

476
00:22:50.205 --> 00:22:51.840
Well, I'm committed
to thinking freely

477
00:22:51.873 --> 00:22:54.309
about how to improve our world.

478
00:22:54.342 --> 00:22:56.444
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

479
00:22:56.478 --> 00:22:59.447
You're a physicist, you
pick and choose rules?

480
00:22:59.481 --> 00:23:01.049
Or do you use the discipline

481
00:23:01.082 --> 00:23:03.218
to channel your
energies into progress?

482
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:05.654
I like a little wiggle room.

483
00:23:06.754 --> 00:23:08.957
Do you always tow
the party line?

484
00:23:10.325 --> 00:23:12.093
I like my wiggle room too.

485
00:23:13.828 --> 00:23:15.997
(Jean breathing heavily)

486
00:23:20.035 --> 00:23:21.069
(exhales deeply)

487
00:23:22.237 --> 00:23:24.772
- ROBERT: What?
- (chuckles)

488
00:23:24.806 --> 00:23:25.974
Wait, wait, wait.

489
00:23:29.878 --> 00:23:31.479
JEAN: Unexpected.

490
00:23:31.513 --> 00:23:33.415
- What?
- For a physicist.

491
00:23:33.448 --> 00:23:36.218
You only have a
shelf full of Freud?

492
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:39.120
Well, actually, my
background's more...

493
00:23:39.154 --> 00:23:40.989
Uh, Jungian?

494
00:23:42.123 --> 00:23:43.225
You know analysis?

495
00:23:43.258 --> 00:23:45.793
When I was in
post-grad at Cambridge,

496
00:23:45.827 --> 00:23:47.128
I had a little trouble.

497
00:23:48.129 --> 00:23:50.865
- I'll bite.
- I tried to poison my tutor.

498
00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:51.900
Did you hate him?

499
00:23:51.933 --> 00:23:53.401
I liked him very much.

500
00:23:53.435 --> 00:23:55.337
You just needed to get laid.

501
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.938
Took my analyst two years,

502
00:23:56.972 --> 00:23:58.916
and I don't think they ever
put it that succinctly.

503
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.275
You have everyone convinced

504
00:24:00.308 --> 00:24:03.044
you're more complicated
than you actually are.

505
00:24:03.078 --> 00:24:05.080
We're all simple souls, I guess.

506
00:24:05.113 --> 00:24:06.281
I'm not.

507
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.185
What's this?

508
00:24:10.218 --> 00:24:11.785
Sanskrit.

509
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.121
You can read this?

510
00:24:13.154 --> 00:24:14.956
I'm learning.

511
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.962
Read this.

512
00:24:22.397 --> 00:24:24.032
Well, in this part,

513
00:24:24.065 --> 00:24:26.268
Vishnu reveals his
multi-armed self...

514
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:27.302
No.

515
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.238
Read the words.

516
00:24:33.608 --> 00:24:36.777
"And now I am become Death.

517
00:24:42.217 --> 00:24:43.952
Destroyer of worlds."

518
00:24:44.886 --> 00:24:46.388
(thunder rumbling)

519
00:24:48.123 --> 00:24:50.191
(wind howling)

520
00:24:51.526 --> 00:24:53.995
(disquieting music playing)

521
00:25:08.443 --> 00:25:10.845
(thunder rumbling)

522
00:25:14.883 --> 00:25:16.217
This'll do. (clicks tongue)

523
00:25:22.357 --> 00:25:23.958
It'll break before dawn.

524
00:25:23.992 --> 00:25:27.362
Air cools overnight, just
before dawn, it breaks.

525
00:25:30.031 --> 00:25:31.966
(clicks tongue) Come.

526
00:25:33.101 --> 00:25:35.303
(laughter)

527
00:25:38.006 --> 00:25:41.476
Ah. So, I'm getting married.

528
00:25:41.509 --> 00:25:43.111
- Frank. Congratulations!
- Thank you.

529
00:25:43.144 --> 00:25:44.946
- Thank you.
- To Jackie?

530
00:25:44.979 --> 00:25:47.349
- Yeah, to Jackie.
- (clears throat)

531
00:25:47.382 --> 00:25:48.483
The waitress.

532
00:25:48.516 --> 00:25:50.485
Oppie, you're right.
It's lettin' up.

533
00:25:50.518 --> 00:25:52.954
I'm gonna go see if
there's any stars.

534
00:25:52.987 --> 00:25:55.023
All your talk about
the common man,

535
00:25:55.056 --> 00:25:56.567
but Jackie's not good
enough for you, hmm?

536
00:25:56.591 --> 00:25:57.625
ROBERT: Mm-mm.

537
00:25:57.659 --> 00:25:59.160
We join the Party and you can't

538
00:25:59.194 --> 00:26:00.962
- hide your disapproval. Why?
- Oh, now, I...

539
00:26:00.995 --> 00:26:02.073
Is that because that's
supposed to be your thing?

540
00:26:02.097 --> 00:26:03.631
I haven't joined
the Party, Frank.

541
00:26:03.665 --> 00:26:06.201
And I don't think she should
have convinced you to either.

542
00:26:06.234 --> 00:26:07.969
Half of the faculty
is Communist.

543
00:26:08.002 --> 00:26:09.070
Not that half.

544
00:26:10.405 --> 00:26:13.141
I'm your brother, Frank, and
I want you to be cautious.

545
00:26:13.174 --> 00:26:14.876
And I want to wring your neck.

546
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.245
(breath shudders)

547
00:26:17.278 --> 00:26:20.181
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

548
00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:25.387
You're happy, I'm happy.

549
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.955
So then I'm happy you're happy

550
00:26:26.988 --> 00:26:28.323
- that I'm happy.
- (chuckles)

551
00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:32.560
(mysterious music playing)

552
00:26:32.594 --> 00:26:34.195
LAWRENCE: I feel
like I could see

553
00:26:34.229 --> 00:26:36.331
one of those dark stars
that you're working on.

554
00:26:36.364 --> 00:26:38.933
You can't. That's
the whole point.

555
00:26:39.601 --> 00:26:41.302
Their gravity swallows light.

556
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.640
It's like a kind
of hole in space.

557
00:26:45.673 --> 00:26:47.008
Is Frank okay?

558
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:49.444
Yes. He just has
a shitty brother.

559
00:26:50.578 --> 00:26:52.247
It is special here.

560
00:26:54.616 --> 00:26:57.085
When I was a kid,

561
00:26:57.118 --> 00:27:00.155
I thought if I could find a way

562
00:27:00.188 --> 00:27:04.559
to combine physics
and New Mexico,

563
00:27:04.592 --> 00:27:07.128
my life would be
perfect. (laughs)

564
00:27:08.196 --> 00:27:09.464
Little remote for that.

565
00:27:09.497 --> 00:27:10.632
Yes.

566
00:27:10.665 --> 00:27:12.333
Let's get some sleep.

567
00:27:13.301 --> 00:27:14.702
ROBERT: That mesa
we saw today,

568
00:27:14.736 --> 00:27:17.238
one of my favorite
places in the world.

569
00:27:18.072 --> 00:27:19.541
And tomorrow we'll climb it.

570
00:27:19.574 --> 00:27:21.009
LAWRENCE: What's it called?

571
00:27:22.043 --> 00:27:24.112
ROBERT: Los Alamos.

572
00:27:27.215 --> 00:27:29.217
I didn't expect
to see you today.

573
00:27:30.385 --> 00:27:32.220
Do I have to make
an appointment?

574
00:27:34.155 --> 00:27:36.291
BARBER: Hey! Hey,
get back here!

575
00:27:36.324 --> 00:27:37.459
Alvarez?

576
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:46.067
ALVAREZ: Oppie! Oppie!

577
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.102
ROBERT: What? What is it?

578
00:27:48.136 --> 00:27:49.737
They've done it.
They've done it.

579
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.039
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.

580
00:27:51.072 --> 00:27:53.241
They split the uranium nucleus.

581
00:27:54.108 --> 00:27:55.977
LAWRENCE: How?

582
00:27:56.711 --> 00:27:58.613
Bombard it with neutrons.

583
00:27:58.646 --> 00:27:59.791
ALVAREZ: It's a
nuclear fission.

584
00:27:59.815 --> 00:28:01.449
They did it, they
split the atom.

585
00:28:01.483 --> 00:28:03.051
It's not possible.

586
00:28:03.084 --> 00:28:05.386
(stimulating music playing)

587
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.992
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

588
00:28:17.632 --> 00:28:19.567
See? Can't be done.

589
00:28:20.668 --> 00:28:24.072
LAWRENCE: Very
elegant. Quite clear.

590
00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:26.741
- There's just one problem.
- Where?

591
00:28:26.774 --> 00:28:28.576
Next door.

592
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.545
Alvarez did it.

593
00:28:30.578 --> 00:28:32.714
- But then look...
- (pulsing)

594
00:28:32.747 --> 00:28:36.084
these fission pulses,
they're massive.

595
00:28:36.117 --> 00:28:39.387
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

596
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.257
Theory will take
you only so far.

597
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.725
(gasps)

598
00:28:43.758 --> 00:28:45.760
During the process...

599
00:28:45.793 --> 00:28:47.529
extra neutrons boil off,

600
00:28:47.562 --> 00:28:50.732
which could be used to
split other uranium atoms.

601
00:28:50.765 --> 00:28:52.166
Chain reaction.

602
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.836
You're thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'.

603
00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:56.638
You, me, and every other
physicist around the world

604
00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:58.172
who's seen the news.

605
00:28:58.874 --> 00:29:00.675
I'm... what? What
are we all thinking?

606
00:29:00.708 --> 00:29:04.479
A bomb, Alvarez.

607
00:29:05.647 --> 00:29:07.348
A bomb.

608
00:29:07.382 --> 00:29:10.585
I told you, Robert, no
more fucking flowers.

609
00:29:12.186 --> 00:29:13.731
I don't understand
what you want from me.

610
00:29:13.755 --> 00:29:15.523
I don't want anything from you.

611
00:29:16.524 --> 00:29:18.560
Well, you say that
and then you call.

612
00:29:18.593 --> 00:29:21.195
Well, don't answer.

613
00:29:21.229 --> 00:29:23.231
I'll always answer.

614
00:29:28.503 --> 00:29:29.437
Fine.

615
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:32.173
Just no more flowers.
(breathing heavily)

616
00:29:33.207 --> 00:29:34.576
You're not coming?

617
00:29:35.743 --> 00:29:38.546
CHEVALIER: You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

618
00:29:40.849 --> 00:29:42.584
It's not that simple, Hoke.

619
00:29:42.617 --> 00:29:44.786
MAN: Chevalier, good
to see you. It's...

620
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.154
Ah, Barbara, good to see you

621
00:29:46.187 --> 00:29:48.656
and the illustrious
Dr. Oppenheimer.

622
00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:49.858
I'm Eltenton.

623
00:29:49.892 --> 00:29:51.268
- ROBERT: Oh, pleasure.
- Please, please.

624
00:29:51.292 --> 00:29:52.460
Now, might you say a word

625
00:29:52.493 --> 00:29:55.229
about organized labor
on campuses, yes?

626
00:29:55.263 --> 00:29:56.798
Coming through! Coming through!

627
00:29:56.832 --> 00:29:58.409
- (chanting): F.A.E.C.T.!
- I work at Shell.

628
00:29:58.433 --> 00:30:00.444
We've signed up chemists,
we've signed up engineers,

629
00:30:00.468 --> 00:30:02.337
so why not scientists
in academia?

630
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.273
(chanting): Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie!

631
00:30:05.306 --> 00:30:08.576
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

632
00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.244
Oppie! Oppie!

633
00:30:10.278 --> 00:30:13.181
- Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
- (cheers and applause)

634
00:30:16.351 --> 00:30:20.321
Teachers are unionized.
Why not professors?

635
00:30:20.355 --> 00:30:21.789
Don't you have somewhere to be?

636
00:30:21.824 --> 00:30:23.658
Lawrence, academics
have rights too.

637
00:30:23.691 --> 00:30:26.194
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.

638
00:30:26.227 --> 00:30:29.430
- Well, I'll sit in.
- Not this one.

639
00:30:31.733 --> 00:30:33.134
(door opens)

640
00:30:35.703 --> 00:30:37.372
ROBERT: Richard. Dr. Bush.

641
00:30:37.405 --> 00:30:39.474
What brings you two up north?

642
00:30:41.576 --> 00:30:43.645
(somber music playing)

643
00:30:45.948 --> 00:30:47.315
(sighs)

644
00:30:48.951 --> 00:30:50.318
Richard, you tell Ruth

645
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:51.671
I'll be down to
Pasadena Thursday.

646
00:30:57.425 --> 00:30:58.526
(sighs)

647
00:31:00.628 --> 00:31:03.264
STUDENT 1: Your paper
on black holes is in!

648
00:31:03.297 --> 00:31:05.266
- STUDENT 2: Oppie!
- (applause)

649
00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:08.937
Where's Hartland? Get
Hartland. Get Hartland.

650
00:31:08.971 --> 00:31:11.239
LOMANITZ: September 1st, 1939,

651
00:31:11.272 --> 00:31:13.508
the world's gonna
remember this day.

652
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:14.409
(Robert chuckles)

653
00:31:14.442 --> 00:31:15.920
Oh, Hartland. Our
paper, it's in print.

654
00:31:15.944 --> 00:31:18.680
SNYDER: You've been upstaged.

655
00:31:22.283 --> 00:31:24.820
During the Battle of
Britain, I found myself

656
00:31:24.853 --> 00:31:27.588
increasingly out of sympathy
with the (clears throat)

657
00:31:27.622 --> 00:31:30.625
policy of neutrality that
Communists advocated.

658
00:31:30.658 --> 00:31:34.462
Right after Hitler invaded
Russia and we became allies,

659
00:31:34.495 --> 00:31:36.531
these Communist sympathies,
did they return?

660
00:31:36.564 --> 00:31:37.598
No.

661
00:31:38.733 --> 00:31:42.336
I need to make clear that
my changing views on Russia

662
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:43.604
did not mean a sharp break

663
00:31:43.638 --> 00:31:45.707
from those who held
different views.

664
00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:48.309
For a year or two, and
during a previous marriage,

665
00:31:48.342 --> 00:31:51.646
my wife Kitty had been a
Communist Party member.

666
00:31:52.647 --> 00:31:54.248
(Kitty laughing)

667
00:31:54.282 --> 00:31:55.616
KITTY: Oop!

668
00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.452
This way. This is where
I keep the good stuff.

669
00:31:57.485 --> 00:31:59.487
Well, I thought this
was the Tolmans' house.

670
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.723
I live with them
while I'm at Caltech.

671
00:32:01.756 --> 00:32:03.257
Do you two need anything?

672
00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:04.759
ROBERT: We're good, Ruthie.

673
00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:08.496
So, you're a biologist.

674
00:32:08.529 --> 00:32:11.733
Well, somehow I have
graduated to housewife.

675
00:32:11.766 --> 00:32:14.903
Can you explain quantum
mechanics to me?

676
00:32:14.937 --> 00:32:15.971
Seems baffling.

677
00:32:16.004 --> 00:32:17.705
Yes, it is.

678
00:32:18.807 --> 00:32:21.609
Well, this glass,

679
00:32:21.642 --> 00:32:22.543
this drink...

680
00:32:22.577 --> 00:32:25.680
- (knocks countertop)
- this countertop,

681
00:32:25.713 --> 00:32:28.817
uh, our bodies...

682
00:32:28.851 --> 00:32:30.752
all of it.

683
00:32:30.785 --> 00:32:33.354
It's mostly empty space.

684
00:32:33.387 --> 00:32:35.891
Groupings of tiny energy
waves bound together.

685
00:32:35.924 --> 00:32:37.792
By what?

686
00:32:37.826 --> 00:32:41.395
Forces of attraction strong
enough to convince us

687
00:32:41.429 --> 00:32:43.631
that matter is solid.

688
00:32:43.664 --> 00:32:46.801
Stop my body passing
through yours.

689
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.375
(indistinct chatter)

690
00:32:58.546 --> 00:33:00.048
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

691
00:33:00.082 --> 00:33:01.817
Not very.

692
00:33:03.852 --> 00:33:07.555
There is someone that I feel...

693
00:33:07.588 --> 00:33:09.024
Does she feel the same way?

694
00:33:09.057 --> 00:33:12.895
Sometimes. Not enough.

695
00:33:14.096 --> 00:33:17.065
You know, I'm going
to New Mexico.

696
00:33:17.099 --> 00:33:18.901
To my ranch, with friends.

697
00:33:18.934 --> 00:33:20.301
You should come.

698
00:33:21.103 --> 00:33:22.938
I meant with your husband.

699
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:24.539
Yes, you did.

700
00:33:24.572 --> 00:33:27.475
'Cause you know it won't
make a bit of difference.

701
00:33:27.508 --> 00:33:29.710
(sentimental music playing)

702
00:33:31.445 --> 00:33:32.948
Why did you marry him?

703
00:33:32.981 --> 00:33:36.517
I was lost and he was kind.

704
00:33:38.686 --> 00:33:39.554
Lost?

705
00:33:39.587 --> 00:33:43.091
Well, my previous
husband had died, and...

706
00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:45.560
at 28, I wasn't really
ready to be a widow.

707
00:33:45.593 --> 00:33:47.595
- Who was your first husband?
- Nobody.

708
00:33:47.628 --> 00:33:50.098
But my second husband
was Joe Dallet.

709
00:33:50.132 --> 00:33:53.101
He was, um, from
money, like me, but...

710
00:33:53.135 --> 00:33:56.071
he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

711
00:33:56.104 --> 00:33:57.371
Fell hard.

712
00:33:57.405 --> 00:33:58.673
(chuckles) How hard?

713
00:33:58.706 --> 00:34:00.374
Hard enough to spend
the next four years

714
00:34:00.408 --> 00:34:01.742
living off beans and pancakes,

715
00:34:01.776 --> 00:34:04.545
handing out the <i>Daily
Worker</i> at factory gates.

716
00:34:04.579 --> 00:34:07.082
By 36, I just told Joe I
couldn't take it anymore.

717
00:34:07.115 --> 00:34:08.984
Quit the Party and a year later,

718
00:34:09.017 --> 00:34:12.553
I wanted him back, so...
Him, not the <i>Daily Worker.</i>

719
00:34:12.587 --> 00:34:14.731
And he said, "Swell, I'll
meet you on my way to Spain."

720
00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:16.457
He went to fight
for the Loyalists?

721
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:18.593
And then he went to the
brigades and I waited.

722
00:34:18.626 --> 00:34:19.694
And...

723
00:34:20.561 --> 00:34:21.930
Joe got himself killed

724
00:34:21.964 --> 00:34:24.365
first time he popped his
head out of the trench.

725
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.136
Ideology got Joe
killed. For nothing.

726
00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.038
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

727
00:34:30.072 --> 00:34:31.182
My husband offered
both our futures

728
00:34:31.206 --> 00:34:32.673
to stop one fascist bullet

729
00:34:32.707 --> 00:34:34.877
from embedding
itself in a mudbank.

730
00:34:35.776 --> 00:34:37.612
That's the definition
of nothing.

731
00:34:37.645 --> 00:34:39.647
Seems a little reductive.

732
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.415
Pragmatic.

733
00:34:41.449 --> 00:34:43.886
Now here I am.

734
00:34:46.121 --> 00:34:47.722
Wherever the hell this is.

735
00:34:49.091 --> 00:34:51.927
(sentimental music continues)

736
00:34:54.762 --> 00:34:58.033
I didn't want you to
hear it from anyone else.

737
00:34:58.066 --> 00:35:00.434
(crying softly)

738
00:35:00.468 --> 00:35:03.805
Least you didn't bring
me flowers. (sniffles)

739
00:35:04.907 --> 00:35:07.042
(chuckles)

740
00:35:07.075 --> 00:35:08.911
(tender music playing)

741
00:35:08.944 --> 00:35:12.513
We both know I'm not
what you want, Jean.

742
00:35:13.547 --> 00:35:16.184
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

743
00:35:16.218 --> 00:35:17.618
No.

744
00:35:19.187 --> 00:35:21.555
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

745
00:35:22.757 --> 00:35:24.492
You knocked her up, fast work.

746
00:35:24.525 --> 00:35:27.162
- Can't keep a good man down.
- (scoffs)

747
00:35:27.195 --> 00:35:29.197
I meant her.

748
00:35:29.231 --> 00:35:31.233
She knew what she wanted.

749
00:35:31.266 --> 00:35:33.201
What about the husband?

750
00:35:33.235 --> 00:35:34.702
We talked, um,

751
00:35:34.735 --> 00:35:36.671
they're getting a divorce, so...

752
00:35:36.704 --> 00:35:40.474
we can get married before
she starts showing.

753
00:35:40.508 --> 00:35:41.977
How civilized.

754
00:35:43.946 --> 00:35:45.047
You idiot.

755
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.848
This is your community.

756
00:35:46.882 --> 00:35:49.818
You think the rules don't
apply to the golden boy?

757
00:35:50.986 --> 00:35:52.620
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

758
00:35:52.653 --> 00:35:55.157
Don't alienate the only
people in the world

759
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.858
that understand what you do.

760
00:35:58.592 --> 00:35:59.962
One day you might need them.

761
00:35:59.995 --> 00:36:02.730
F.A.E.C.T. MEMBERS
(chanting): F.A.E.C.T.!

762
00:36:02.763 --> 00:36:03.975
ROBERT: The Federation
of Architects,

763
00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:07.135
Engineers, Chemists
and Technicians.

764
00:36:07.169 --> 00:36:08.669
(chanting stops)

765
00:36:13.574 --> 00:36:16.111
Lomanitz, what do
you get paid a month?

766
00:36:16.144 --> 00:36:17.288
That's not the point, Lawrence.

767
00:36:17.312 --> 00:36:19.613
What do any of
you have in common

768
00:36:19.647 --> 00:36:22.250
with farm laborers
and dock workers?

769
00:36:22.284 --> 00:36:23.852
LOMANITZ: Plenty.

770
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.456
Everybody out. Now!

771
00:36:31.293 --> 00:36:32.693
Not you.

772
00:36:35.563 --> 00:36:38.599
(door closes)

773
00:36:38.632 --> 00:36:39.600
What are you doing?

774
00:36:39.633 --> 00:36:41.303
It's a trade union.

775
00:36:41.336 --> 00:36:43.271
Filled with Communists.

776
00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:45.007
So? I haven't joined the Party.

777
00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.142
They won't let me bring
you onto the project

778
00:36:47.175 --> 00:36:48.877
because of this shit.

779
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.687
They won't even let me tell
you what the project is.

780
00:36:50.711 --> 00:36:53.148
Oh. (scoffs) I know
what the project is.

781
00:36:53.181 --> 00:36:54.249
Oh, really?

782
00:36:54.282 --> 00:36:55.583
We've all heard about Einstein

783
00:36:55.616 --> 00:36:56.894
and Szilard's
letter to Roosevelt

784
00:36:56.918 --> 00:36:58.719
warning him the Germans
could make a bomb,

785
00:36:58.753 --> 00:37:01.622
and I know what it means for
the Nazis to have a bomb.

786
00:37:01.655 --> 00:37:03.025
Oh, and I don't?

787
00:37:03.058 --> 00:37:05.693
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

788
00:37:06.794 --> 00:37:07.795
It's mine.

789
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:10.966
You think that I tell
them about your politics.

790
00:37:12.067 --> 00:37:14.635
The next time you're
coming home from a meeting,

791
00:37:14.668 --> 00:37:16.704
why don't you take a look
in the rearview mirror?

792
00:37:16.737 --> 00:37:18.807
Listen to the sounds
on your phone line

793
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.910
and stop being so goddamn naive.

794
00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:24.745
Why would they care what I do?

795
00:37:24.779 --> 00:37:26.747
(scoffs) Because you're
not just self-important,

796
00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:28.950
you're actually important.

797
00:37:30.185 --> 00:37:31.552
Okay.

798
00:37:32.187 --> 00:37:35.190
Okay. I get it.

799
00:37:35.223 --> 00:37:37.292
If you could just
be a little more...

800
00:37:37.325 --> 00:37:38.827
Pragmatic.

801
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.971
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others,

802
00:37:39.995 --> 00:37:42.097
you don't have to
worry. It's done.

803
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.899
Lawrence.

804
00:37:48.736 --> 00:37:50.738
Then welcome to the war.

805
00:37:50.771 --> 00:37:53.075
ROBERT: I filled out my
first security questionnaire

806
00:37:53.108 --> 00:37:54.376
and was informed

807
00:37:54.409 --> 00:37:56.211
that my involvement
with left-wing groups

808
00:37:56.244 --> 00:38:00.182
would not prove a bar to my
working on the atomic program.

809
00:38:00.215 --> 00:38:02.951
SENATOR PASTORE: <i>Why were
his Communist associations</i>

810
00:38:02.984 --> 00:38:06.088
not seen as a security
risk during the war?

811
00:38:06.121 --> 00:38:07.856
Senator, I can't possibly answer

812
00:38:07.889 --> 00:38:11.226
for security clearance granted
years before I ever met the man.

813
00:38:11.259 --> 00:38:13.261
Fine. What about after?

814
00:38:13.295 --> 00:38:15.230
After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer

815
00:38:15.263 --> 00:38:19.034
was the most respected
scientific voice in the world.

816
00:38:19.067 --> 00:38:21.103
That's why I asked him
to run the Institute,

817
00:38:21.136 --> 00:38:24.239
that's why he advised the
Atomic Energy Commission.

818
00:38:24.272 --> 00:38:25.340
Simple as that.

819
00:38:25.373 --> 00:38:27.976
What are they accusing me of?

820
00:38:28.009 --> 00:38:29.777
I think they just want
to know what happened

821
00:38:29.811 --> 00:38:32.314
between 1947 and 1954
to change your mind

822
00:38:32.347 --> 00:38:34.382
on Oppenheimer's
security clearance.

823
00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:37.152
I didn't. I was
chair of the AEC,

824
00:38:37.185 --> 00:38:40.754
but it wasn't me that brought
the charges against Robert.

825
00:38:40.788 --> 00:38:42.033
- Who did?
- Some former staff member

826
00:38:42.057 --> 00:38:43.992
of the Joint
Congressional Committee.

827
00:38:44.025 --> 00:38:47.095
He was a rabid
anti-Communist named Borden.

828
00:38:47.129 --> 00:38:49.431
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

829
00:38:49.464 --> 00:38:52.000
The FBI? Why not go
to the AEC, direct?

830
00:38:52.033 --> 00:38:54.735
Why get caught holding
the knife yourself?

831
00:38:54.768 --> 00:38:57.205
What did Borden have
against Oppenheimer?

832
00:38:57.239 --> 00:38:59.074
This was the McCarthy Era.

833
00:38:59.107 --> 00:39:04.012
People hounded out of jobs
for any hint of red. And then,

834
00:39:04.045 --> 00:39:05.713
<i>reading Oppenheimer's
security file,</i>

835
00:39:05.746 --> 00:39:07.916
<i>his Communist brother,
sister-in-law,</i>

836
00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:10.018
<i>fiancée, best friend, wife.</i>

837
00:39:10.051 --> 00:39:12.387
That's before we even get
to the Chevalier incident.

838
00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.158
But how would Borden have access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

839
00:39:16.191 --> 00:39:17.859
Because somebody gave it to him.

840
00:39:19.027 --> 00:39:21.695
Somebody who wanted
Robert silenced.

841
00:39:21.729 --> 00:39:23.331
- Who?
- Who knows?

842
00:39:23.365 --> 00:39:25.901
Robert didn't take
care not to upset

843
00:39:25.934 --> 00:39:28.170
the power brokers in Washington.

844
00:39:28.203 --> 00:39:31.072
His opinions on the
atom became definitive

845
00:39:31.106 --> 00:39:34.009
and he wasn't always patient
with us mere mortals.

846
00:39:34.042 --> 00:39:35.210
(chuckles softly)

847
00:39:37.412 --> 00:39:39.848
I came in for plenty
of harsh treatment.

848
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:43.051
There was an AEC vote

849
00:39:43.084 --> 00:39:45.053
on the export of
isotopes to Norway,

850
00:39:45.086 --> 00:39:48.056
<i>and they drafted in Robert
to make me look like a fool.</i>

851
00:39:48.089 --> 00:39:49.790
CONGRESSMAN: But,
Dr. Oppenheimer,

852
00:39:49.824 --> 00:39:51.927
we've already heard from
Admiral Strauss that

853
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.795
these isotopes could be
useful to our enemies

854
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:56.140
in the production
of atomic weapons.

855
00:39:56.164 --> 00:39:58.033
ROBERT: Congressmen,
you could use a shovel

856
00:39:58.066 --> 00:39:59.510
- in making atomic weapons.
- (laughter)

857
00:39:59.534 --> 00:40:00.734
In fact, you do.

858
00:40:00.768 --> 00:40:02.304
You could use a bottle of beer

859
00:40:02.337 --> 00:40:03.737
in making atomic weapons.

860
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:05.240
In fact, you do.

861
00:40:05.273 --> 00:40:08.210
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components

862
00:40:08.243 --> 00:40:11.012
but more useful than a sandwich.

863
00:40:11.046 --> 00:40:12.814
(all laughing)

864
00:40:14.249 --> 00:40:16.117
STRAUSS: <i>Genius is no
guarantee of wisdom.</i>

865
00:40:17.118 --> 00:40:19.888
How could this man who
saw so much be so blind?

866
00:40:20.855 --> 00:40:24.226
(baby crying)

867
00:40:29.397 --> 00:40:30.832
Kitty?

868
00:40:35.537 --> 00:40:37.472
Kitty?

869
00:40:37.505 --> 00:40:40.909
Kitty, the project...

870
00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:44.479
I'm in. I'm in.

871
00:40:44.512 --> 00:40:46.281
Let's celebrate. (sighs)

872
00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:50.518
(baby continues crying)

873
00:40:50.552 --> 00:40:51.886
(Kitty moans)

874
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.521
Shouldn't you go to him?

875
00:40:53.555 --> 00:40:54.990
(uneasy music playing)

876
00:40:58.126 --> 00:41:01.296
I have been going to
him all fucking day.

877
00:41:10.438 --> 00:41:12.107
(baby crying)

878
00:41:16.311 --> 00:41:18.313
(shushing)

879
00:41:18.346 --> 00:41:19.780
(knock at door)

880
00:41:25.053 --> 00:41:26.787
BARBARA: Come here, darling.

881
00:41:27.889 --> 00:41:29.457
I don't know how to say this.

882
00:41:29.491 --> 00:41:32.193
I'm... I'm ashamed to ask.

883
00:41:32.227 --> 00:41:34.162
CHEVALIER: Anything.

884
00:41:34.195 --> 00:41:34.996
Take Peter.

885
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.066
- Sure.
- No, for-for a while, Hoke.

886
00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:40.068
A while.

887
00:41:41.636 --> 00:41:43.438
Does Kitty know you're here?

888
00:41:43.471 --> 00:41:45.206
Yes, of course she knows.

889
00:41:46.074 --> 00:41:48.076
Of course she knows. (sighs)

890
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:51.813
We're awful people.
Selfish, awful people.

891
00:41:53.315 --> 00:41:54.316
Forget I asked.

892
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:56.184
Selfish, awful people,

893
00:41:56.217 --> 00:41:58.620
they don't know they're
selfish and awful.

894
00:41:58.653 --> 00:42:01.222
Sit, sit, sit.

895
00:42:02.257 --> 00:42:06.361
Robert, you see beyond
the world we live in.

896
00:42:08.063 --> 00:42:10.632
There is a price to
be paid for that.

897
00:42:10.665 --> 00:42:12.233
Of course we'll help you.

898
00:42:13.668 --> 00:42:16.071
(wistful music playing)

899
00:42:23.178 --> 00:42:25.347
KITTY: Everything's
changing, Robert.

900
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.349
Having a child was
always going to change...

901
00:42:27.382 --> 00:42:31.486
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

902
00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:33.922
It's reforming.

903
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.392
This is your moment.

904
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.237
We're putting together a
group to study feasibility...

905
00:42:40.261 --> 00:42:43.064
"We" shouldn't be doing
anything. You should.

906
00:42:43.965 --> 00:42:46.101
Lawrence won't get this done.

907
00:42:46.134 --> 00:42:48.269
Or Tolman or Rabi. You will.

908
00:42:51.506 --> 00:42:53.141
(indistinct chatter)

909
00:42:57.112 --> 00:42:59.247
ROBERT: Who are the uniforms?

910
00:43:00.048 --> 00:43:01.950
I thought you might know.

911
00:43:02.984 --> 00:43:05.253
- (door opens)
- MAN: Dr. Oppenheimer.

912
00:43:05.286 --> 00:43:07.255
I'm Colonel Groves.

913
00:43:07.288 --> 00:43:09.524
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Nichols.

914
00:43:09.557 --> 00:43:11.059
Have that dry-cleaned.

915
00:43:14.629 --> 00:43:16.931
(door opens, closes)

916
00:43:16.965 --> 00:43:19.033
Well, if that's how you
treat Lieutenant Colonel,

917
00:43:19.067 --> 00:43:22.437
I'd hate to see how you
treat a humble physicist.

918
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:24.539
Ah, if I ever meet
one, I'll let you know.

919
00:43:24.572 --> 00:43:26.074
(chuckles softly) Ouch.

920
00:43:26.107 --> 00:43:27.675
Theaters of combat
all over the world,

921
00:43:27.709 --> 00:43:29.644
but I have to stay
in Washington.

922
00:43:29.677 --> 00:43:32.380
- Why?
- I built the Pentagon.

923
00:43:32.414 --> 00:43:35.049
The brass likes it so much
they made me take over

924
00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:37.218
the Manhattan Engineer District.

925
00:43:37.252 --> 00:43:38.386
Which is?

926
00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.689
Oh, don't be a smart ass. You
know damn well what it is.

927
00:43:41.723 --> 00:43:43.425
You and half of every
physics department

928
00:43:43.458 --> 00:43:46.294
across the country.
That's problem number one.

929
00:43:46.327 --> 00:43:48.062
I thought problem
number one would be

930
00:43:48.096 --> 00:43:49.364
securing enough uranium ore.

931
00:43:49.397 --> 00:43:52.500
1,200 tons bought the
day I took charge.

932
00:43:52.534 --> 00:43:53.701
Processing?

933
00:43:53.735 --> 00:43:55.937
Just broke ground at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

934
00:43:56.738 --> 00:43:58.440
Now I'm looking for
a project director.

935
00:43:58.473 --> 00:44:00.575
And my name came up?

936
00:44:00.608 --> 00:44:01.676
Nope.

937
00:44:02.812 --> 00:44:05.046
Even though you brought
quantum physics to America.

938
00:44:05.079 --> 00:44:06.448
Which made me curious.

939
00:44:06.481 --> 00:44:08.349
What have you found out?

940
00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.753
You're a dilettante,
a womanizer,

941
00:44:11.786 --> 00:44:13.121
a suspected Communist...

942
00:44:13.154 --> 00:44:14.556
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

943
00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:16.191
I said "suspected."

944
00:44:16.224 --> 00:44:20.462
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic...

945
00:44:20.495 --> 00:44:21.529
Nothing good, no?

946
00:44:21.563 --> 00:44:23.231
Not even "he's
brilliant, but..."

947
00:44:23.264 --> 00:44:25.066
Well, brilliance is
taken for granted

948
00:44:25.099 --> 00:44:26.601
in your circle, so no.

949
00:44:26.634 --> 00:44:28.603
No, the only person who
had anything good to say

950
00:44:28.636 --> 00:44:30.371
was Richard Tolman.

951
00:44:30.405 --> 00:44:32.507
Tolman thinks you
have integrity,

952
00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.676
but he also strikes me as a guy

953
00:44:34.709 --> 00:44:37.078
who knows more about
science than people.

954
00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:41.082
Yet here you are. You
don't take much on trust.

955
00:44:41.115 --> 00:44:43.117
I don't take anything on trust.

956
00:44:46.688 --> 00:44:48.423
Why don't you have
a Nobel Prize?

957
00:44:48.456 --> 00:44:49.524
Why aren't you a general?

958
00:44:49.557 --> 00:44:50.734
They're making me one for this.

959
00:44:50.758 --> 00:44:52.126
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

960
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.761
A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

961
00:44:53.795 --> 00:44:56.130
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

962
00:44:58.566 --> 00:45:00.201
So how would you proceed?

963
00:45:01.703 --> 00:45:04.405
You're talking
about turning theory

964
00:45:04.439 --> 00:45:06.608
into a practical weapons system

965
00:45:06.641 --> 00:45:07.775
faster than the Nazis.

966
00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.544
Who have a 12-month head start.

967
00:45:09.577 --> 00:45:10.712
Eighteen.

968
00:45:10.745 --> 00:45:12.113
How could you
possibly know that?

969
00:45:12.146 --> 00:45:14.182
Our fast neutron
research took six months.

970
00:45:14.215 --> 00:45:15.726
The man they've
undoubtedly put in charge

971
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.151
will have made that
leap instantly.

972
00:45:17.185 --> 00:45:18.395
Who do you think
they put in charge?

973
00:45:18.419 --> 00:45:19.521
Werner Heisenberg.

974
00:45:19.554 --> 00:45:22.123
He has the most
intuitive understanding

975
00:45:22.156 --> 00:45:23.826
of atomic structure
I have ever seen.

976
00:45:23.859 --> 00:45:25.560
- You know his work?
- I know him.

977
00:45:25.593 --> 00:45:27.438
<i>Just like I know Walther
Bothe, von Weizsäcker, Diebner.</i>

978
00:45:27.462 --> 00:45:30.265
In a straight race,
the Germans win.

979
00:45:30.298 --> 00:45:33.034
- We've got one hope.
- Which is?

980
00:45:33.635 --> 00:45:35.270
Anti-Semitism.

981
00:45:36.404 --> 00:45:37.405
What?

982
00:45:37.438 --> 00:45:40.275
Hitler called quantum
physics "Jewish science."

983
00:45:40.308 --> 00:45:42.143
Said it right to
Einstein's face.

984
00:45:42.176 --> 00:45:45.413
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so... so blinded by hate

985
00:45:45.446 --> 00:45:47.248
that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

986
00:45:47.282 --> 00:45:49.217
because it'll take
vast resources.

987
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.795
Our nation's best
scientists working together.

988
00:45:50.819 --> 00:45:52.220
Right now, they're scattered.

989
00:45:52.253 --> 00:45:53.856
Which gives us
compartmentalization.

990
00:45:53.889 --> 00:45:55.757
All minds have to
see the whole task

991
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.158
to contribute efficiently.

992
00:45:57.191 --> 00:45:59.427
Poor security may
cost us the race.

993
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.296
Inefficiency will.

994
00:46:01.329 --> 00:46:03.164
The Germans know
more than us anyway.

995
00:46:03.197 --> 00:46:05.300
The Russians don't.

996
00:46:05.333 --> 00:46:09.270
Remind me, who are
we at war with?

997
00:46:09.304 --> 00:46:11.739
Somebody with your past
doesn't want to be seen

998
00:46:11.773 --> 00:46:13.374
downplaying the importance

999
00:46:13.408 --> 00:46:16.144
of security from our
Communist allies.

1000
00:46:16.177 --> 00:46:18.847
Point taken. But, no.

1001
00:46:18.881 --> 00:46:21.182
(scoffs) You don't
get to say "no" to me.

1002
00:46:21.215 --> 00:46:23.484
It's my job to say "no"
to you when you're wrong.

1003
00:46:23.518 --> 00:46:25.520
So you have the job now?

1004
00:46:25.553 --> 00:46:27.622
Uh, I'm considering it.

1005
00:46:30.325 --> 00:46:32.660
I'm starting to see where
you got your reputation.

1006
00:46:33.862 --> 00:46:36.297
My favorite response,

1007
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:38.666
"Oppenheimer couldn't
run a hamburger stand."

1008
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.602
(chuckles)

1009
00:46:40.635 --> 00:46:41.635
I couldn't.

1010
00:46:43.471 --> 00:46:45.640
But I can run the
Manhattan Project.

1011
00:46:46.507 --> 00:46:48.676
There's a way to
balance these things.

1012
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:52.915
Keep the Rad Lab here at
Berkeley under Lawrence.

1013
00:46:52.948 --> 00:46:55.216
Met Lab in Chicago,
under Szilard.

1014
00:46:55.249 --> 00:46:57.685
Large-scale refining, where
did you say? Tennessee.

1015
00:46:57.719 --> 00:46:59.387
- And Hanford.
- And Hanford.

1016
00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.491
All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

1017
00:47:03.524 --> 00:47:04.893
connected by rail.

1018
00:47:04.927 --> 00:47:06.594
Focused on one goal.

1019
00:47:06.628 --> 00:47:09.330
One point in space and time.
And it comes together here.

1020
00:47:09.364 --> 00:47:11.666
<i>A secret laboratory. In
the middle of nowhere,</i>

1021
00:47:11.699 --> 00:47:13.167
<i>secure, self-sufficient,</i>

1022
00:47:13.201 --> 00:47:14.569
equipment, housing, the works.

1023
00:47:14.602 --> 00:47:16.771
Keep everyone there
until it's done.

1024
00:47:16.805 --> 00:47:18.841
It'll need a school,
stores, a church.

1025
00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:20.308
Why?

1026
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:21.652
ROBERT: <i>If we don't
let scientists</i>

1027
00:47:21.676 --> 00:47:23.387
bring their families,
we'll never get the best.

1028
00:47:23.411 --> 00:47:25.480
You want security, build
a town, build it fast.

1029
00:47:25.513 --> 00:47:26.581
Where?

1030
00:47:30.585 --> 00:47:32.553
Welcome to Los Alamos.

1031
00:47:32.587 --> 00:47:35.390
Now, there's a boys school
we'll have to commandeer,

1032
00:47:35.423 --> 00:47:37.401
and the local Indians come
up here for burial rites.

1033
00:47:37.425 --> 00:47:40.662
But, apart from that, nothing.
Forty miles. Any direction.

1034
00:47:40.695 --> 00:47:42.630
Enough to find the perfect spot.

1035
00:47:42.664 --> 00:47:45.166
- For?
- Success.

1036
00:47:46.634 --> 00:47:48.703
(gripping music playing)

1037
00:47:50.438 --> 00:47:52.440
Build him a town. Fast.

1038
00:47:53.474 --> 00:47:55.978
Let's go recruit
some scientists.

1039
00:47:56.011 --> 00:47:58.346
Why would I leave my family?

1040
00:47:58.379 --> 00:47:59.824
I told you, you can
bring your family.

1041
00:47:59.848 --> 00:48:01.282
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

1042
00:48:01.315 --> 00:48:03.418
A soldier? He's a general.

1043
00:48:03.451 --> 00:48:05.286
I've got all the soldier I need.

1044
00:48:05.319 --> 00:48:06.889
What can I tell them?

1045
00:48:06.922 --> 00:48:09.257
Heisenberg, Diebner,
Bothe and Bohr.

1046
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:10.591
What do these men
have in common?

1047
00:48:10.625 --> 00:48:12.627
The greatest minds
on atomic theory.

1048
00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.996
- Yes, and?
- Uh...

1049
00:48:14.029 --> 00:48:17.298
As much as you like,

1050
00:48:17.331 --> 00:48:19.467
until you feel my
boot on your balls.

1051
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:22.270
You know isotopes and
you know explosives

1052
00:48:22.303 --> 00:48:23.604
better than anyone in the world.

1053
00:48:23.638 --> 00:48:26.240
But you can't tell
us what you're doing?

1054
00:48:26.274 --> 00:48:27.542
(Groves sighs)

1055
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.546
- I don't know.
- The Nazis have them.

1056
00:48:31.579 --> 00:48:33.715
- Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
- Under Nazi occupation.

1057
00:48:33.748 --> 00:48:35.616
Did they stop printing
newspapers in Princeton?

1058
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.986
Why would we go to
the middle of nowhere

1059
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.487
for who knows how
long? (chuckling)

1060
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.622
For a year or two. Or three.

1061
00:48:42.623 --> 00:48:46.227
Uh, General, could
you give us a moment?

1062
00:48:47.295 --> 00:48:50.364
It's about unleashing
the strong force...

1063
00:48:51.499 --> 00:48:52.901
before the Nazis do.

1064
00:48:52.935 --> 00:48:54.870
Oh, my God.

1065
00:48:54.903 --> 00:48:56.014
Niels won't work for the Nazis.

1066
00:48:56.038 --> 00:48:57.338
No, never.

1067
00:48:57.371 --> 00:48:59.674
But while they
have him, we don't.

1068
00:48:59.707 --> 00:49:00.876
That's why I need you.

1069
00:49:00.909 --> 00:49:02.878
Why would you think I'd do that?

1070
00:49:02.911 --> 00:49:04.746
"Why?" "Why?"

1071
00:49:04.779 --> 00:49:06.991
How about because this is the
most important fucking thing

1072
00:49:07.015 --> 00:49:09.017
to ever happen in the
history of the world.

1073
00:49:09.051 --> 00:49:10.485
How about that?

1074
00:49:11.053 --> 00:49:12.487
Fuck.

1075
00:49:15.924 --> 00:49:17.391
(door shuts)

1076
00:49:17.425 --> 00:49:19.794
They are not gonna let
me onto this project.

1077
00:49:19.828 --> 00:49:21.897
And failing a security
check is not gonna be good

1078
00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:23.598
for a career, even
after the war.

1079
00:49:23.631 --> 00:49:26.400
So you're a fellow
traveler. So what?

1080
00:49:26.434 --> 00:49:27.802
This is a national emergency.

1081
00:49:27.836 --> 00:49:31.006
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

1082
00:49:31.039 --> 00:49:32.340
They need us.

1083
00:49:32.373 --> 00:49:34.542
Until they don't.

1084
00:49:37.612 --> 00:49:40.015
Is there any chance of
getting Bohr out of Denmark?

1085
00:49:40.048 --> 00:49:43.051
Nah, no dice. I checked
with the British.

1086
00:49:43.085 --> 00:49:45.386
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

1087
00:49:45.419 --> 00:49:46.822
there's just no way.

1088
00:49:48.356 --> 00:49:49.791
Is he that important?

1089
00:49:49.825 --> 00:49:52.861
How many people do you know
who proved Einstein wrong?

1090
00:49:53.929 --> 00:49:56.031
You know, it really would
be quicker to take a plane.

1091
00:49:56.064 --> 00:49:57.799
No, plane's too risky.

1092
00:49:57.833 --> 00:50:00.301
Country needs us.

1093
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.771
The Harvard guys,

1094
00:50:03.806 --> 00:50:06.374
they say the building's too
small for the cyclotron.

1095
00:50:08.609 --> 00:50:10.511
ROBERT: Get them together
with the architects.

1096
00:50:13.714 --> 00:50:15.716
When's this place
supposed to open?

1097
00:50:18.821 --> 00:50:19.821
Two months.

1098
00:50:20.755 --> 00:50:23.025
Robert, you're the
great improviser,

1099
00:50:23.058 --> 00:50:25.093
but this... (sighs)

1100
00:50:25.127 --> 00:50:26.727
you can't do in your head.

1101
00:50:27.762 --> 00:50:29.363
Four divisions.

1102
00:50:30.498 --> 00:50:34.102
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

1103
00:50:34.136 --> 00:50:35.103
Who's running Theoretical?

1104
00:50:35.137 --> 00:50:36.537
ROBERT: I am.

1105
00:50:36.571 --> 00:50:37.782
RABI: That's what
I was afraid of.

1106
00:50:37.806 --> 00:50:39.674
You're spread too thin.

1107
00:50:40.876 --> 00:50:42.577
So you take Theoretical.

1108
00:50:45.147 --> 00:50:48.382
I'm not coming here, Robert.

1109
00:50:54.022 --> 00:50:55.690
Why not?

1110
00:50:58.994 --> 00:51:00.361
(scoffs)

1111
00:51:01.562 --> 00:51:05.633
You drop a bomb and it falls
on the just and the unjust.

1112
00:51:05.666 --> 00:51:06.869
(sighs)

1113
00:51:06.902 --> 00:51:09.537
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

1114
00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.974
to be a weapon of
mass destruction.

1115
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:15.376
(pensive music playing)

1116
00:51:21.183 --> 00:51:22.516
ROBERT: Izzy.

1117
00:51:23.651 --> 00:51:27.788
I don't know if we can be
trusted with such a weapon.

1118
00:51:29.157 --> 00:51:32.460
But I know the Nazis can't.

1119
00:51:35.864 --> 00:51:38.666
We have no choice.

1120
00:51:40.068 --> 00:51:41.502
Then...

1121
00:51:42.838 --> 00:51:45.207
the second thing you'll
have to do is appoint

1122
00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.508
Hans Bethe to run the
Theoretical division.

1123
00:51:47.541 --> 00:51:49.845
(rousing music playing)

1124
00:51:49.878 --> 00:51:51.712
Wait, what was the first?

1125
00:51:51.746 --> 00:51:54.216
Take off that
ridiculous uniform.

1126
00:51:54.249 --> 00:51:55.449
You're a scientist.

1127
00:51:55.483 --> 00:51:57.085
Groves is insisting we join.

1128
00:51:57.119 --> 00:51:59.553
Tell Groves to go
shit in his hat.

1129
00:51:59.587 --> 00:52:03.058
They need us for who
we are. So be yourself.

1130
00:52:03.091 --> 00:52:05.060
Only better.

1131
00:52:05.093 --> 00:52:07.695
(rousing music continues)

1132
00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:46.134
This is the only key.

1133
00:52:46.168 --> 00:52:47.601
And Teller's already here.

1134
00:52:47.635 --> 00:52:49.503
- (sighs)
- Shall I just show him in?

1135
00:52:49.537 --> 00:52:51.206
No, let's wait for the others.

1136
00:52:51.239 --> 00:52:52.773
(door opens)

1137
00:52:59.147 --> 00:53:00.148
Let's get started.

1138
00:53:00.182 --> 00:53:02.250
Hello, Edward.

1139
00:53:02.284 --> 00:53:03.986
Yes.

1140
00:53:04.019 --> 00:53:05.720
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

1141
00:53:05.753 --> 00:53:08.756
until the T-section at
Los Alamos is finished.

1142
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:11.093
- Edward, can I please...
- It is more important.

1143
00:53:13.161 --> 00:53:15.130
When I calculated
the chain reaction,

1144
00:53:15.163 --> 00:53:17.866
I found a rather
troubling possibility.

1145
00:53:17.899 --> 00:53:20.002
BETHE: No.

1146
00:53:20.035 --> 00:53:21.269
But this can't be right.

1147
00:53:21.303 --> 00:53:23.238
Show me how you did
your calculations.

1148
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:24.672
TELLER: Yes.

1149
00:53:28.176 --> 00:53:29.244
LAWRENCE: It's exponential.

1150
00:53:29.277 --> 00:53:31.746
BETHE: No. No, no, no. No.

1151
00:53:34.282 --> 00:53:36.284
This is fantasy.

1152
00:53:36.318 --> 00:53:38.586
Teller's calculations
can't be right.

1153
00:53:38.619 --> 00:53:41.289
Do them yourself while
I go to Princeton.

1154
00:53:41.323 --> 00:53:43.158
- What for?
- To talk to Einstein.

1155
00:53:43.191 --> 00:53:45.760
Well, there's not much common
ground between you two.

1156
00:53:45.793 --> 00:53:48.830
That's why I should
get his view.

1157
00:53:48.864 --> 00:53:50.564
(birds chirping)

1158
00:53:52.267 --> 00:53:54.269
- Albert.
- Hmm?

1159
00:53:54.302 --> 00:53:57.205
Ah. Dr. Oppenheimer. (chuckles)

1160
00:53:57.239 --> 00:53:58.706
Well, have you met Dr. Gödel?

1161
00:53:58.739 --> 00:54:00.308
We walk here most days.

1162
00:54:00.342 --> 00:54:05.147
Trees are the most
inspiring structures.

1163
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.647
Albert, might I have a word?

1164
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:10.085
Of course. 'Scuse me, Kurt.

1165
00:54:11.086 --> 00:54:14.022
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

1166
00:54:14.056 --> 00:54:15.656
Even in Princeton.

1167
00:54:15.689 --> 00:54:18.793
He's convinced that the
Nazis can poison his food.

1168
00:54:18.827 --> 00:54:20.095
Mm.

1169
00:54:20.128 --> 00:54:21.963
Hmm? Huh.

1170
00:54:23.832 --> 00:54:25.666
Wha...

1171
00:54:25.699 --> 00:54:27.903
(suspenseful music playing)

1172
00:54:30.205 --> 00:54:33.041
Whose... Whose work is this?

1173
00:54:33.075 --> 00:54:34.109
Teller's.

1174
00:54:35.243 --> 00:54:37.711
What do you take it to mean?

1175
00:54:37.745 --> 00:54:39.680
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

1176
00:54:39.713 --> 00:54:43.751
releasing neutrons to
smash into other nuclei.

1177
00:54:43.784 --> 00:54:45.987
Criticality, a
point of no return,

1178
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:47.621
massive explosive force.

1179
00:54:47.655 --> 00:54:49.991
But this time, the chain
reaction doesn't stop.

1180
00:54:50.892 --> 00:54:53.862
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1181
00:54:53.895 --> 00:54:54.896
(whooshing)

1182
00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:56.898
When we detonate
an atomic device,

1183
00:54:56.932 --> 00:54:59.101
we might start a
chain reaction that...

1184
00:55:00.068 --> 00:55:01.602
destroys the world.

1185
00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.672
So here we are, hmm?

1186
00:55:04.705 --> 00:55:09.010
Lost in your quantum
world of probabilities

1187
00:55:09.044 --> 00:55:10.778
and needing certainty.

1188
00:55:10.812 --> 00:55:13.681
Can you run the
calculations yourself?

1189
00:55:13.714 --> 00:55:15.117
(chuckles) About the only thing

1190
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:18.420
you and I have in common is
a disdain for mathematics.

1191
00:55:18.453 --> 00:55:21.022
Who's working on
this in-in Berkeley?

1192
00:55:21.056 --> 00:55:22.357
Hans Bethe.

1193
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:24.226
Well, he'll get to the truth.

1194
00:55:25.861 --> 00:55:28.729
And if the truth
is catastrophic?

1195
00:55:28.762 --> 00:55:30.065
Then you stop.

1196
00:55:30.098 --> 00:55:33.835
And you share your
findings with the Nazis.

1197
00:55:33.869 --> 00:55:37.005
So neither side
destroys the world.

1198
00:55:40.208 --> 00:55:41.243
Robert.

1199
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:45.914
This is yours, not mine.

1200
00:55:58.792 --> 00:56:00.195
BETHE: Teller's wrong.

1201
00:56:00.228 --> 00:56:01.429
- He's wrong.
- (shushing)

1202
00:56:01.463 --> 00:56:03.697
(keys jingling)

1203
00:56:11.106 --> 00:56:13.808
BETHE: When you know Teller's
critical assumptions,

1204
00:56:13.842 --> 00:56:15.177
the real picture emerges.

1205
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:17.012
Bottom line?

1206
00:56:17.045 --> 00:56:19.147
The chances of an
uncontrolled nuclear reaction

1207
00:56:19.181 --> 00:56:20.182
are near zero.

1208
00:56:20.215 --> 00:56:22.851
Near zero. (breathes heavily)

1209
00:56:22.884 --> 00:56:25.153
- Oppie, this is good news.
- Mm.

1210
00:56:26.488 --> 00:56:27.721
Can you run them again?

1211
00:56:27.755 --> 00:56:29.491
No, you'll get the same answer.

1212
00:56:29.524 --> 00:56:31.102
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

1213
00:56:31.126 --> 00:56:33.962
the best assurance you're
going to get is this.

1214
00:56:33.995 --> 00:56:35.063
Near zero.

1215
00:56:37.265 --> 00:56:39.935
(exhales sharply) Theory
will take you only so far.

1216
00:56:39.968 --> 00:56:41.469
- BETHE: Mm.
- CHEVALIER: <i>Hello!</i>

1217
00:56:41.503 --> 00:56:42.813
- BARBARA: Hello, you.
- KITTY: Hi.

1218
00:56:42.837 --> 00:56:44.172
BARBARA: We missed him.

1219
00:56:44.206 --> 00:56:45.340
You want to adopt?

1220
00:56:45.373 --> 00:56:46.774
- She's kidding.
- (Kitty chuckles)

1221
00:56:46.808 --> 00:56:48.742
We wanted to see
you before we left.

1222
00:56:48.776 --> 00:56:51.947
- For parts unknown.
- (chuckles)

1223
00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.516
CHEVALIER: You know who
I ran into the other day?

1224
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:56.184
Eltenton.

1225
00:56:56.218 --> 00:56:57.485
ROBERT: Oh.

1226
00:56:57.519 --> 00:56:59.221
The chemist from
Shell? The union guy?

1227
00:56:59.254 --> 00:57:03.124
CHEVALIER: Yeah. He...
The, uh, F.A.E.C.T. guy.

1228
00:57:03.158 --> 00:57:06.528
He was moaning about how
we're handling the war.

1229
00:57:06.561 --> 00:57:08.762
ROBERT: How so?

1230
00:57:08.796 --> 00:57:11.533
Lack of cooperation
with our allies.

1231
00:57:11.566 --> 00:57:13.902
Apparently our
government's not sharing

1232
00:57:13.935 --> 00:57:16.037
any research with the Russians.

1233
00:57:16.071 --> 00:57:17.038
Well, he said,

1234
00:57:17.072 --> 00:57:19.808
"Most scientists think
the policy is stupid."

1235
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:23.111
(suspenseful music playing)

1236
00:57:23.144 --> 00:57:24.980
- ROBERT: Oh, yeah?
- CHEVALIER: Yeah.

1237
00:57:25.013 --> 00:57:27.382
He mentioned that if anyone

1238
00:57:27.415 --> 00:57:30.385
had anything they
wanted to pass on,

1239
00:57:30.418 --> 00:57:32.254
uh, going around
official channels,

1240
00:57:32.287 --> 00:57:34.222
that he could help.

1241
00:57:42.864 --> 00:57:44.532
That would be treason.

1242
00:57:44.566 --> 00:57:47.402
Yes, of course.

1243
00:57:47.435 --> 00:57:49.237
I just thought you should know.

1244
00:57:52.374 --> 00:57:53.842
The brat is down.

1245
00:57:53.875 --> 00:57:55.243
Where are the martinis?

1246
00:58:00.448 --> 00:58:01.950
Coming right up.

1247
00:58:01.983 --> 00:58:03.451
<i>Conversation ended there.</i>

1248
00:58:03.485 --> 00:58:05.587
Nothing in our
long-standing friendship

1249
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.188
would have led me to believe

1250
00:58:07.222 --> 00:58:09.958
that Chevalier was actually
seeking information,

1251
00:58:09.991 --> 00:58:12.460
and I am certain
that he had no idea

1252
00:58:12.494 --> 00:58:14.795
of the work in
which I was engaged.

1253
00:58:19.334 --> 00:58:21.303
It has long been clear to me

1254
00:58:21.336 --> 00:58:24.039
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

1255
00:58:24.072 --> 00:58:25.583
SENATOR McGEE: <i>The
Oppenheimer situation</i>

1256
00:58:25.607 --> 00:58:28.510
<i>highlights the tension
between scientists</i>

1257
00:58:28.543 --> 00:58:30.145
and the security apparatus.

1258
00:58:30.178 --> 00:58:32.047
In hopes of learning
how the nominee handled

1259
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.416
such issues during
his time at the AEC,

1260
00:58:34.449 --> 00:58:37.952
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

1261
00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.188
Who are they bringing in?

1262
00:58:40.221 --> 00:58:41.189
They hadn't said.

1263
00:58:41.222 --> 00:58:42.590
STRAUSS: Mr. Chairman,
if I may,

1264
00:58:42.624 --> 00:58:45.160
I'm nominated for
Commerce Secretary.

1265
00:58:45.193 --> 00:58:47.495
Why seek the opinion
of scientists?

1266
00:58:47.529 --> 00:58:49.864
This is a Cabinet post, Admiral.

1267
00:58:49.898 --> 00:58:52.067
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1268
00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:54.903
Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying.

1269
00:58:54.936 --> 00:58:56.438
I'd like the chance
to cross-examine.

1270
00:58:56.471 --> 00:58:58.606
This is not a court.

1271
00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.042
STRAUSS: (grunts)
Formality, huh?

1272
00:59:01.076 --> 00:59:02.353
SENATE AIDE: No
presidential Cabinet nominee

1273
00:59:02.377 --> 00:59:04.946
has failed to be
confirmed since 1925.

1274
00:59:04.979 --> 00:59:07.082
This is just how
the game is played.

1275
00:59:07.115 --> 00:59:08.416
It's in the bag, Lewis.

1276
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:09.651
So play nice.

1277
00:59:09.684 --> 00:59:11.953
<i>They bring in a
scientist, so what?</i>

1278
00:59:11.986 --> 00:59:13.988
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

1279
00:59:14.022 --> 00:59:16.057
They resent anyone who
questions their judgment,

1280
00:59:16.091 --> 00:59:18.093
<i>especially if you're
not one of them.</i>

1281
00:59:18.126 --> 00:59:19.427
I was chair of the AEC.

1282
00:59:19.461 --> 00:59:21.896
I'm easy to blame for
what happened to Robert.

1283
00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:23.231
We can't have the
Senate thinking

1284
00:59:23.264 --> 00:59:26.368
the scientific community
doesn't support you, sir.

1285
00:59:26.401 --> 00:59:28.236
Or should we pivot?

1286
00:59:28.269 --> 00:59:30.238
- SENATE AIDE: To what?
- And embrace it.

1287
00:59:30.271 --> 00:59:33.041
"I fought Oppenheimer,
and the US won."

1288
00:59:33.074 --> 00:59:34.642
I-I don't think we
need to go there.

1289
00:59:34.676 --> 00:59:36.954
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

1290
00:59:36.978 --> 00:59:38.418
- Teller.
- He'll make an impression.

1291
00:59:38.446 --> 00:59:40.524
Can you get the name of the
scientist they've called?

1292
00:59:40.548 --> 00:59:42.117
- Probably.
- Find out if he was

1293
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:44.519
based in Chicago or Los
Alamos during the war.

1294
00:59:44.552 --> 00:59:45.920
Why does that matter?

1295
00:59:45.954 --> 00:59:47.164
Well, if he was
based in Chicago,

1296
00:59:47.188 --> 00:59:48.599
then he worked under
Szilard and Fermi,

1297
00:59:48.623 --> 00:59:50.925
not the cult of
Oppie at Los Alamos.

1298
00:59:50.959 --> 00:59:52.193
Robert built that damn place.

1299
00:59:52.227 --> 00:59:54.996
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,

1300
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:56.431
all rolled into one.

1301
00:59:56.464 --> 00:59:58.900
(gripping music playing)

1302
01:00:04.706 --> 01:00:07.442
(baby crying)

1303
01:00:09.377 --> 01:00:11.179
All it needs is a saloon.

1304
01:00:36.137 --> 01:00:38.540
(mutters indistinctly)

1305
01:00:39.607 --> 01:00:42.177
There's no kitchen.

1306
01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:46.147
Really? We'll fix that.

1307
01:00:46.181 --> 01:00:48.416
(gripping music continues)

1308
01:00:52.053 --> 01:00:55.457
BETHE: Barbed wire, guns.

1309
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:56.591
Oppie.

1310
01:00:56.624 --> 01:00:58.259
ROBERT: We're at war, Hans.

1311
01:01:00.662 --> 01:01:03.231
Halifax. 1917.

1312
01:01:03.264 --> 01:01:06.234
A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

1313
01:01:06.267 --> 01:01:08.603
(explosions)

1314
01:01:08.636 --> 01:01:11.573
A vast and sudden
chemical reaction.

1315
01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:13.475
(violent whooshing)

1316
01:01:15.243 --> 01:01:18.079
The biggest man-made
explosion in history.

1317
01:01:18.112 --> 01:01:20.081
Now let's calculate how
much more destructive

1318
01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:22.784
it would have been
if it were a nuclear

1319
01:01:22.818 --> 01:01:24.486
and not a chemical reaction.

1320
01:01:24.519 --> 01:01:28.156
Expressing power in
terms of tons of TNT.

1321
01:01:28.189 --> 01:01:29.691
But it will be thousands.

1322
01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:33.161
Well, then kilotons.

1323
01:01:36.731 --> 01:01:40.101
Using U-235,

1324
01:01:40.134 --> 01:01:42.704
- the bomb will need a...
- Uh-uh.

1325
01:01:42.737 --> 01:01:45.808
Sorry. Gadget will
need a 33-pound sphere

1326
01:01:45.841 --> 01:01:47.308
about this size.

1327
01:01:47.342 --> 01:01:51.145
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

1328
01:01:52.547 --> 01:01:53.781
Here's the amount of uranium

1329
01:01:53.816 --> 01:01:57.151
Oak Ridge refined
all of last month.

1330
01:01:59.554 --> 01:02:03.558
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

1331
01:02:04.692 --> 01:02:07.795
Now, if we can
enrich these amounts,

1332
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:10.632
- we need a way to detonate them.
- (paper tearing)

1333
01:02:10.665 --> 01:02:12.767
Are we boring you, Edward?

1334
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.402
TELLER: A little bit, yes.

1335
01:02:14.435 --> 01:02:15.670
May I ask why?

1336
01:02:15.703 --> 01:02:17.138
TELLER: We all
entered this room

1337
01:02:17.171 --> 01:02:19.107
knowing a fission
bomb was possible.

1338
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.743
How 'bout we leave it
with something new?

1339
01:02:21.776 --> 01:02:22.777
Such as?

1340
01:02:22.811 --> 01:02:25.547
Instead of uranium or plutonium,

1341
01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.581
we use hydrogen.

1342
01:02:26.614 --> 01:02:28.116
(others murmur and laugh)

1343
01:02:28.149 --> 01:02:29.760
- TELLER: Heavy hydrogen.
- FEYNMAN: Hydrogen.

1344
01:02:29.784 --> 01:02:32.554
Deuterium. You see?

1345
01:02:32.587 --> 01:02:34.289
We compact the atoms together

1346
01:02:34.322 --> 01:02:37.392
under great pressure to
induce a fusion reaction.

1347
01:02:38.326 --> 01:02:41.162
Then we'll get not kilotons,

1348
01:02:41.195 --> 01:02:42.263
but megatons.

1349
01:02:42.297 --> 01:02:43.231
FEYNMAN: A big
fission reaction...

1350
01:02:43.264 --> 01:02:44.833
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1351
01:02:44.867 --> 01:02:49.571
So how do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1352
01:02:49.604 --> 01:02:51.673
A small fission bomb.

1353
01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:53.408
FEYNMAN: There we are.

1354
01:02:53.441 --> 01:02:55.310
- (laughter)
- (scattered applause)

1355
01:02:55.343 --> 01:02:57.145
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

1356
01:02:57.178 --> 01:02:59.147
can we get back to
the business at hand?

1357
01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.524
SENATOR BARTLETT:
The isotopes issue

1358
01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:04.185
wasn't your most important
policy disagreement

1359
01:03:04.218 --> 01:03:05.854
with Dr. Oppenheimer.

1360
01:03:05.888 --> 01:03:08.289
It was the hydrogen
bomb, wasn't it?

1361
01:03:08.323 --> 01:03:11.192
Uh, as colleagues,
we agreed to disagree

1362
01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:13.227
on a great many things, uh,

1363
01:03:13.261 --> 01:03:14.495
and, well, one of them

1364
01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:17.599
was the need for an
H-bomb program, yes.

1365
01:03:17.632 --> 01:03:20.602
- (siren wailing)
- (uneasy music playing)

1366
01:03:30.445 --> 01:03:33.214
Thanks for convening
on short notice.

1367
01:03:33.247 --> 01:03:34.716
I can't believe it.

1368
01:03:35.717 --> 01:03:37.251
Well, here we are.

1369
01:03:37.285 --> 01:03:39.287
Catch me up. What do we know?

1370
01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.824
One of our B-29s over
the North Pacific

1371
01:03:41.857 --> 01:03:43.358
has detected radiation.

1372
01:03:43.391 --> 01:03:45.159
Do we have the filter papers?

1373
01:03:45.193 --> 01:03:47.195
There's no doubt what this is.

1374
01:03:47.228 --> 01:03:48.439
White House says
there's a doubt.

1375
01:03:48.463 --> 01:03:49.898
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1376
01:03:49.932 --> 01:03:52.634
Are those the long-range
detection filter papers?

1377
01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:55.637
It's an atomic test.

1378
01:03:58.272 --> 01:03:59.674
The Russians have a bomb.

1379
01:03:59.707 --> 01:04:03.444
We're supposed to be years
ahead of them, but some...

1380
01:04:03.478 --> 01:04:05.780
What were you guys
doing at Los Alamos?

1381
01:04:05.814 --> 01:04:06.949
Wasn't security tight?

1382
01:04:06.982 --> 01:04:08.483
Of course it was.
You weren't there.

1383
01:04:08.516 --> 01:04:10.919
- It was...
- NICHOLS: Forgive me, Doctor...

1384
01:04:10.953 --> 01:04:13.388
but I was there.

1385
01:04:14.455 --> 01:04:15.790
SERBER: We can now consider

1386
01:04:15.824 --> 01:04:17.759
the actual mechanics
of detonation.

1387
01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:18.927
ROBERT: Any ideas?

1388
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:20.695
SERBER: I call
this "shooting."

1389
01:04:20.728 --> 01:04:24.265
We fire a chunk of fissionable
material into a larger sphere

1390
01:04:24.298 --> 01:04:26.801
with enough force to
achieve criticality.

1391
01:04:26.835 --> 01:04:28.503
What do we think? Anyone?

1392
01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:30.338
TOLMAN: I've been
thinking about implosion.

1393
01:04:30.371 --> 01:04:32.340
Explosives around the
sphere blast inwards,

1394
01:04:32.373 --> 01:04:34.409
- crushing the material.
- (blasting)

1395
01:04:34.442 --> 01:04:36.377
I'd like to
investigate that idea.

1396
01:04:36.411 --> 01:04:38.713
I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

1397
01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:40.816
GROVES: Progress?

1398
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:42.684
Nice to see you too.

1399
01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:44.485
Meet the British contingent.

1400
01:04:44.519 --> 01:04:46.354
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

1401
01:04:46.387 --> 01:04:48.256
How long have you been British?

1402
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:49.500
Since Hitler told
me I wasn't German.

1403
01:04:49.524 --> 01:04:53.327
Uh-huh. Come, welcome
to Los Alamos.

1404
01:04:53.361 --> 01:04:55.229
School's up and running.

1405
01:04:55.263 --> 01:04:57.565
Bar. Always running.

1406
01:04:57.598 --> 01:05:00.601
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

1407
01:05:01.569 --> 01:05:03.571
- Is that...
- ROBERT: Mrs. Serber, yes.

1408
01:05:03.604 --> 01:05:05.007
I've offered jobs
to all the wives.

1409
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.507
Admin, librarians, computation.

1410
01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:08.844
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

1411
01:05:08.877 --> 01:05:11.446
- Are these women qualified?
- ROBERT: Don't be absurd.

1412
01:05:11.479 --> 01:05:13.849
These are some of the brightest
minds in our community.

1413
01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:15.450
And they're already
security cleared.

1414
01:05:15.483 --> 01:05:17.361
I've informed General
Groves you've been holding

1415
01:05:17.385 --> 01:05:18.854
cross-divisional
open discussions

1416
01:05:18.887 --> 01:05:20.588
- on a nightly basis.
- Shut them down.

1417
01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:22.958
Compartmentalization is the
key to maintaining security...

1418
01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:24.492
CONDON: It's only the top men.

1419
01:05:24.525 --> 01:05:26.360
Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

1420
01:05:26.394 --> 01:05:27.595
These men aren't stupid.

1421
01:05:27.628 --> 01:05:29.464
- They can be discreet.
- I don't like it.

1422
01:05:29.497 --> 01:05:32.400
You don't like anything enough
for that to be a fair test.

1423
01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.475
Once a week. Top men only.

1424
01:05:40.508 --> 01:05:41.877
I'd like to bring
my brother here.

1425
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:43.377
No.

1426
01:05:44.012 --> 01:05:45.780
Uh, Nichols...

1427
01:05:46.915 --> 01:05:48.851
I still haven't heard
that my security clearance

1428
01:05:48.884 --> 01:05:50.451
- has been approved.
- It hasn't.

1429
01:05:50.485 --> 01:05:51.854
We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

1430
01:05:51.887 --> 01:05:52.921
No, you should wait.

1431
01:05:54.123 --> 01:05:55.232
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start.

1432
01:05:55.256 --> 01:05:58.326
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact
that your security clearance

1433
01:05:58.359 --> 01:06:00.361
is proving difficult to
obtain is not my fault.

1434
01:06:00.394 --> 01:06:01.662
It's yours.

1435
01:06:01.696 --> 01:06:03.631
May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

1436
01:06:03.664 --> 01:06:04.665
Because I'm going.

1437
01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:08.469
STRAUSS: And how many
people were in these, uh,

1438
01:06:08.503 --> 01:06:10.705
- open discussions?
- NICHOLS: Too many.

1439
01:06:10.738 --> 01:06:12.083
Compartmentalization was
supposed to be the protocol.

1440
01:06:12.107 --> 01:06:14.042
We were in a race
against the Nazis.

1441
01:06:14.076 --> 01:06:16.511
And now the race is
against the Soviets.

1442
01:06:16.544 --> 01:06:18.056
- Not unless we start it.
- STRAUSS: Robert.

1443
01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.482
They just fired a starting gun.

1444
01:06:21.516 --> 01:06:23.484
What's the nature of the
device they detonated?

1445
01:06:23.518 --> 01:06:25.063
ROBERT: The data
indicates it may have been

1446
01:06:25.087 --> 01:06:27.388
a plutonium implosion device.

1447
01:06:27.421 --> 01:06:30.525
Like the one you
built at Los Alamos.

1448
01:06:30.558 --> 01:06:32.393
The Russians have a bomb,

1449
01:06:32.426 --> 01:06:33.704
Truman needs to
know what's next.

1450
01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:35.530
What's next? Arms talks.

1451
01:06:35.563 --> 01:06:37.431
- Arms talks.
- Obviously.

1452
01:06:38.366 --> 01:06:39.567
What about the Super?

1453
01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.335
Does Truman even know about it?

1454
01:06:41.369 --> 01:06:43.371
Did we brief him on that?

1455
01:06:43.404 --> 01:06:44.472
Not specifically.

1456
01:06:44.505 --> 01:06:45.808
ROBERT: We still don't know

1457
01:06:45.841 --> 01:06:47.608
if a hydrogen bomb's
technically feasible.

1458
01:06:47.642 --> 01:06:49.553
Right, my understanding is
that Teller proposed it?

1459
01:06:49.577 --> 01:06:51.412
- ROBERT: Yes.
- At Los Alamos?

1460
01:06:51.445 --> 01:06:53.091
Teller's designs have always
been wildly impractical.

1461
01:06:53.115 --> 01:06:55.449
You'd have to
deliver by ox cart.

1462
01:06:55.483 --> 01:06:56.760
- Not airplane.
- LAWRENCE: Oppie.

1463
01:06:56.784 --> 01:07:00.488
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence,
you want to comment?

1464
01:07:01.722 --> 01:07:02.825
No.

1465
01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:06.962
Because if it can
put us ahead again,

1466
01:07:06.995 --> 01:07:10.032
the President of
the United States

1467
01:07:10.065 --> 01:07:12.067
needs to know about it.

1468
01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.568
(scoffs)

1469
01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:15.403
And if the Russians
know about it already,

1470
01:07:15.436 --> 01:07:18.439
from a spy at Los Alamos,

1471
01:07:18.472 --> 01:07:19.774
then we've gotta get going.

1472
01:07:19.808 --> 01:07:22.777
There's no proof there
was a spy at Los Alamos.

1473
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:23.879
Robert.

1474
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.882
(dramatic music playing)

1475
01:07:28.716 --> 01:07:30.484
They put it under
the football stadium?

1476
01:07:30.518 --> 01:07:32.453
The field's not in use anymore.

1477
01:07:32.486 --> 01:07:34.722
Just as well.

1478
01:07:36.024 --> 01:07:38.459
- FERMI: Oppie.
- Dr. Fermi.

1479
01:07:38.492 --> 01:07:41.129
(greets in Italian)

1480
01:07:41.163 --> 01:07:42.496
I hear you got a little town.

1481
01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:43.764
Yes. Come and see.

1482
01:07:43.798 --> 01:07:45.466
(Szilard scoffs)

1483
01:07:45.499 --> 01:07:49.604
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

1484
01:07:49.637 --> 01:07:51.572
Everybody will go crazy.

1485
01:07:51.606 --> 01:07:55.476
Thank you for the vote
of confidence, Szilard.

1486
01:07:55.509 --> 01:07:59.147
Do we really... do we really
need that in the notes?

1487
01:07:59.181 --> 01:08:01.616
When are you going
to try it out?

1488
01:08:01.649 --> 01:08:02.683
We did.

1489
01:08:02.717 --> 01:08:07.089
The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

1490
01:08:07.122 --> 01:08:08.756
Didn't Groves tell you?

1491
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:10.424
No.

1492
01:08:10.458 --> 01:08:12.426
(crackling)

1493
01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.897
(Robert exhales)

1494
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:18.033
GUARD: One at a time,
please, one at a time.

1495
01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:19.533
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1496
01:08:20.635 --> 01:08:23.105
I tried Personnel. They
asked if I could type.

1497
01:08:23.138 --> 01:08:24.438
Can you?

1498
01:08:24.472 --> 01:08:25.606
Harvard forgot to teach that

1499
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.475
on the graduate
chemistry course.

1500
01:08:28.844 --> 01:08:31.746
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig
here on the plutonium team.

1501
01:08:33.115 --> 01:08:35.483
(door slams)

1502
01:08:37.518 --> 01:08:39.187
What the hell were
you doing in Chicago?

1503
01:08:39.221 --> 01:08:40.688
Visiting the Met?

1504
01:08:40.721 --> 01:08:41.732
- Why? Why?
- Well, you can't talk to...

1505
01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:43.791
Because we have every right...

1506
01:08:43.825 --> 01:08:46.161
You have just the
rights that I give you.

1507
01:08:46.194 --> 01:08:47.662
No more, no less.

1508
01:08:47.695 --> 01:08:50.132
We are adults trying
to run a project here.

1509
01:08:50.165 --> 01:08:51.867
This is ridiculous.

1510
01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:53.668
Tell him.

1511
01:08:53.701 --> 01:08:56.838
Compartmentalization is
the protocol we agreed to.

1512
01:08:57.973 --> 01:08:59.207
Enough of this madhouse.

1513
01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:01.609
Nobody can work under
these conditions.

1514
01:09:01.642 --> 01:09:06.081
You know what,
Generalissimo? I quit.

1515
01:09:06.114 --> 01:09:07.515
Thanks for nothing.

1516
01:09:09.617 --> 01:09:11.119
GROVES: Better
off without him.

1517
01:09:11.153 --> 01:09:12.520
(door slams shut)

1518
01:09:12.553 --> 01:09:13.587
Aren't you more concerned

1519
01:09:13.621 --> 01:09:15.991
about his discretion out there?

1520
01:09:16.024 --> 01:09:18.427
We'll have him killed.

1521
01:09:19.261 --> 01:09:21.830
I was just kidding. (chuckles)

1522
01:09:21.863 --> 01:09:24.799
- No, he hates me, not America.
- You know, General,

1523
01:09:24.833 --> 01:09:27.169
not everyone has levers
to pull like mine.

1524
01:09:27.202 --> 01:09:29.037
I don't think I understand.

1525
01:09:29.071 --> 01:09:31.239
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past.

1526
01:09:31.273 --> 01:09:33.008
You hired me because of it.

1527
01:09:34.009 --> 01:09:35.978
So you could control me.

1528
01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:38.612
Well, I'm not that subtle.

1529
01:09:38.646 --> 01:09:40.681
I'm just a humble soldier.

1530
01:09:40.715 --> 01:09:42.226
You're neither humble
nor just a soldier.

1531
01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.261
You studied engineering at MIT.

1532
01:09:43.285 --> 01:09:45.120
Guilty as charged.

1533
01:09:45.153 --> 01:09:46.654
Well, now we
understand each other,

1534
01:09:46.687 --> 01:09:48.132
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

1535
01:09:48.156 --> 01:09:50.959
so I can perform
this miracle for you.

1536
01:09:55.864 --> 01:09:57.607
LLOYD GARRISON: <i>General
Groves, were you aware</i>

1537
01:09:57.631 --> 01:09:59.935
<i>of Dr. Oppenheimer's
left-wing associations</i>

1538
01:09:59.968 --> 01:10:01.635
<i>when you appointed him?</i>

1539
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:03.314
GROVES: I was aware that there
were suspicions about him.

1540
01:10:03.338 --> 01:10:05.207
I was aware he
had a very extreme

1541
01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.607
liberal background.

1542
01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.252
In your opinion, would
he ever consciously

1543
01:10:08.276 --> 01:10:09.577
commit a disloyal act?

1544
01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:11.213
I would be amazed if he did.

1545
01:10:11.246 --> 01:10:14.316
GARRISON: So you had complete
confidence in his integrity.

1546
01:10:14.349 --> 01:10:15.750
At Los Alamos, yes,

1547
01:10:15.783 --> 01:10:17.119
which is where I
really knew him.

1548
01:10:17.152 --> 01:10:19.121
General, did your
security officers

1549
01:10:19.154 --> 01:10:20.621
on the project advise you

1550
01:10:20.654 --> 01:10:22.133
against the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1551
01:10:22.157 --> 01:10:25.961
They could not and would not
clear him until I insisted.

1552
01:10:25.994 --> 01:10:28.629
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

1553
01:10:28.662 --> 01:10:29.907
of Dr. Oppenheimer's
security file.

1554
01:10:29.931 --> 01:10:31.599
GROVES: I did.

1555
01:10:31.632 --> 01:10:32.810
Well, then there's only
really one question

1556
01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:34.302
I need answered here today.

1557
01:10:34.336 --> 01:10:36.038
In light of the
current AEC guidelines,

1558
01:10:36.071 --> 01:10:38.773
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1559
01:10:38.807 --> 01:10:40.876
Do you have the guidelines?

1560
01:10:47.949 --> 01:10:50.618
ROBB: Under current
AEC guidelines,

1561
01:10:50.651 --> 01:10:52.686
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1562
01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.957
- (birds chirping)
- (rooster crowing)

1563
01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:08.702
Physics and New
Mexico, huh? (chuckles)

1564
01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:11.772
My God. What a trek.

1565
01:11:11.807 --> 01:11:13.275
That's why you need a liaison.

1566
01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:14.843
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1567
01:11:16.011 --> 01:11:17.079
You're gonna be okay.

1568
01:11:17.112 --> 01:11:18.280
This way, gentlemen.

1569
01:11:18.313 --> 01:11:20.115
(stirring music playing)

1570
01:11:20.148 --> 01:11:22.650
(speaking indistinctly)

1571
01:11:28.256 --> 01:11:30.092
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Leslie.

1572
01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:32.693
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

1573
01:11:32.726 --> 01:11:35.063
Compartmentalization. I
understand completely.

1574
01:11:38.233 --> 01:11:39.234
LOMANITZ: Okay.

1575
01:11:39.267 --> 01:11:40.368
(indistinct chatter)

1576
01:11:40.402 --> 01:11:41.837
Thank you.

1577
01:11:46.274 --> 01:11:48.742
(cheering and applauding)

1578
01:11:49.743 --> 01:11:50.988
LAWRENCE: <i>Greetings
from Berkeley.</i>

1579
01:11:51.012 --> 01:11:53.148
I am here to update
you on our progress

1580
01:11:53.181 --> 01:11:54.715
and solicit your input.

1581
01:11:54.748 --> 01:11:56.127
To do so, I am going
to have to share

1582
01:11:56.151 --> 01:11:59.821
a few things that General
Groves told me not to.

1583
01:11:59.855 --> 01:12:01.655
Sorry, General, I
said I understood,

1584
01:12:01.689 --> 01:12:02.756
not that I agreed.

1585
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:04.326
- (laughter)
- 'Kay.

1586
01:12:04.359 --> 01:12:06.394
Gentlemen, to business.

1587
01:12:06.428 --> 01:12:08.796
There were rumors of
espionage at Los Alamos.

1588
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:10.308
ROBERT: Unsubstantiated.
Unsubstantiated.

1589
01:12:10.332 --> 01:12:11.799
STRAUSS: I'm told

1590
01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:13.144
that there were
Communists on the project.

1591
01:12:13.168 --> 01:12:14.936
We didn't knowingly
employ any Communists.

1592
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:16.746
I just want to know,
were any of them involved

1593
01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:18.240
in discussions of the Super?

1594
01:12:18.273 --> 01:12:20.451
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

1595
01:12:20.475 --> 01:12:22.743
My brother had left
the Party by then.

1596
01:12:22.776 --> 01:12:24.012
What about Lomanitz?

1597
01:12:24.045 --> 01:12:25.779
Lomanitz was never
employed at Los Alamos.

1598
01:12:25.814 --> 01:12:26.815
He was a liaison.

1599
01:12:26.848 --> 01:12:28.016
Our security was tight,

1600
01:12:28.049 --> 01:12:29.427
as former Colonel
Nichols well knows.

1601
01:12:29.451 --> 01:12:31.019
Our security was as
tight as it could be

1602
01:12:31.052 --> 01:12:32.420
given the
personalities involved,

1603
01:12:32.454 --> 01:12:34.289
but attempts were made.

1604
01:12:34.322 --> 01:12:35.333
What is that supposed to mean?

1605
01:12:35.357 --> 01:12:36.925
We've all read his file here.

1606
01:12:37.959 --> 01:12:39.961
Do we need to talk
about Jean Tatlock?

1607
01:12:40.495 --> 01:12:42.663
Or the Chevalier incident?

1608
01:12:47.269 --> 01:12:48.669
'Scuse me.

1609
01:12:50.505 --> 01:12:51.940
(telephone ringing)

1610
01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:53.942
CHARLOTTE: That's
Lomanitz, line one.

1611
01:12:59.814 --> 01:13:00.849
Hello, Rossi.

1612
01:13:00.882 --> 01:13:04.085
<i>What? O-Okay, just calm down.</i>

1613
01:13:05.053 --> 01:13:08.290
There's been another screw-up.
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1614
01:13:08.323 --> 01:13:10.791
- We are at war, Doctor.
- Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1615
01:13:10.825 --> 01:13:12.827
We need this kid.
Fix it, will you?

1616
01:13:12.861 --> 01:13:14.062
It wasn't a mistake.

1617
01:13:14.095 --> 01:13:15.439
Your friend Lomanitz
has been trying

1618
01:13:15.463 --> 01:13:17.731
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

1619
01:13:17.765 --> 01:13:19.067
He promised to quit all that.

1620
01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.002
Well, he hasn't.

1621
01:13:21.036 --> 01:13:22.904
Security officer at
Berkeley's concerned about

1622
01:13:22.938 --> 01:13:25.240
Communist infiltration
through that union,

1623
01:13:25.273 --> 01:13:27.876
- the F.A...
- F.A.E.C.T.

1624
01:13:30.278 --> 01:13:33.982
While I'm there next week,
I'll drop in to see him.

1625
01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:37.986
Your Q clearance came through.

1626
01:13:41.523 --> 01:13:42.967
It's important you
not maintain or renew

1627
01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:45.260
any questionable associations.

1628
01:13:49.998 --> 01:13:52.500
ROBB: <i>Doctor, did you
think social contacts</i>

1629
01:13:52.534 --> 01:13:54.869
between a person engaged
on secret war work

1630
01:13:54.903 --> 01:13:56.271
and Communists was dangerous?

1631
01:13:56.304 --> 01:13:59.975
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

1632
01:14:00.008 --> 01:14:02.911
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

1633
01:14:02.944 --> 01:14:06.147
<i>you felt that such contacts
were potentially dangerous.</i>

1634
01:14:10.819 --> 01:14:12.554
(elevator dings)

1635
01:14:12.587 --> 01:14:15.557
ROBERT: <i>Were conceivably
dangerous, yes.</i>

1636
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:17.859
ROBB: <i>I mean, really,</i>

1637
01:14:17.892 --> 01:14:19.928
<i>known Communists.</i>

1638
01:14:22.063 --> 01:14:24.299
ROBERT: <i>Look... (sighs)</i>

1639
01:14:24.332 --> 01:14:25.867
I've had a lot of secrets

1640
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.870
<i>- in my head for a long time.</i>
- (knock on door)

1641
01:14:29.838 --> 01:14:31.115
<i>Doesn't matter who
I associate with.</i>

1642
01:14:31.139 --> 01:14:34.042
I don't talk about
those secrets.

1643
01:14:41.449 --> 01:14:43.084
ROBB: You said
in your statement

1644
01:14:43.118 --> 01:14:49.057
that you had to see
Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1645
01:14:50.525 --> 01:14:52.193
You left.

1646
01:14:53.428 --> 01:14:54.863
Not a word.

1647
01:14:54.896 --> 01:14:57.365
What did you think
that would do to me?

1648
01:14:58.466 --> 01:14:59.534
I wrote.

1649
01:14:59.567 --> 01:15:01.970
Pages of nothing.

1650
01:15:04.239 --> 01:15:06.574
Where did you go?

1651
01:15:06.608 --> 01:15:09.044
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

1652
01:15:09.077 --> 01:15:11.813
Because you're a Communist.

1653
01:15:13.348 --> 01:15:15.216
Why did you have to see her?

1654
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:18.353
Because she had
indicated a great desire

1655
01:15:18.386 --> 01:15:20.055
to see me before we left.

1656
01:15:20.088 --> 01:15:21.256
At that time, I couldn't,

1657
01:15:21.289 --> 01:15:25.093
but I felt that
she had to see me.

1658
01:15:25.126 --> 01:15:27.629
She was undergoing
psychiatric treatment.

1659
01:15:27.662 --> 01:15:29.898
She was extremely unhappy.

1660
01:15:29.931 --> 01:15:31.933
Did you find out why
she had to see you?

1661
01:15:31.966 --> 01:15:34.102
(grim music playing)

1662
01:15:37.038 --> 01:15:39.107
Because she was still
in love with me.

1663
01:15:40.975 --> 01:15:43.878
(heavy breathing)

1664
01:15:46.314 --> 01:15:48.383
Spent the night
together, didn't you?

1665
01:15:56.358 --> 01:15:57.392
ROBERT: Yes.

1666
01:16:03.064 --> 01:16:06.935
You drop in and out of my life,

1667
01:16:06.968 --> 01:16:09.437
and you don't have
to tell me why.

1668
01:16:09.471 --> 01:16:10.939
Now that's power.

1669
01:16:10.972 --> 01:16:13.007
Not that I enjoy.

1670
01:16:13.975 --> 01:16:16.111
I'd rather be here
for you as you need.

1671
01:16:16.144 --> 01:16:18.613
But you have other
priorities now.

1672
01:16:18.646 --> 01:16:21.416
I have a wife and child.

1673
01:16:22.417 --> 01:16:25.220
That's not what either
of us is talking about.

1674
01:16:28.656 --> 01:16:30.525
Jean.

1675
01:16:30.558 --> 01:16:32.694
You asked me to come.

1676
01:16:32.727 --> 01:16:35.096
And I'm glad I did.

1677
01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:38.299
But I can't see you again.

1678
01:16:40.702 --> 01:16:42.404
But what if I need you?

1679
01:16:45.974 --> 01:16:48.943
You said you would
always answer.

1680
01:16:51.413 --> 01:16:52.547
Not a word?

1681
01:16:53.816 --> 01:16:54.892
ROBB: <i>Did you think that
consistent with good security?</i>

1682
01:16:54.916 --> 01:16:57.585
- As a matter of fact, it was.
- (rhythmic stomping)

1683
01:16:57.619 --> 01:16:59.988
<i>Not a word.</i>

1684
01:17:00.021 --> 01:17:02.190
ROBB: When did you
see her after that?

1685
01:17:03.024 --> 01:17:05.193
(stomping intensifying)

1686
01:17:08.663 --> 01:17:10.565
(stomping stops)

1687
01:17:10.598 --> 01:17:12.267
I never saw her again.

1688
01:17:18.473 --> 01:17:21.109
I can make the last
train back to Princeton.

1689
01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:24.312
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

1690
01:17:24.345 --> 01:17:26.481
Today you said it to
history, didn't you?

1691
01:17:26.514 --> 01:17:28.049
This is a closed hearing.

1692
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:31.362
KITTY: If they don't
release the transcript,

1693
01:17:31.386 --> 01:17:33.388
- I'm sure you will.
- ROBERT: I was under oath.

1694
01:17:33.421 --> 01:17:35.190
KITTY: Well, you were
under an oath for me

1695
01:17:35.223 --> 01:17:37.025
when you went to see Jean.

1696
01:17:37.692 --> 01:17:39.127
You know, you...

1697
01:17:40.028 --> 01:17:42.330
you sit there, day after day,

1698
01:17:42.363 --> 01:17:45.400
letting them pick
our lives to pieces.

1699
01:17:48.403 --> 01:17:50.104
Why won't you fight?

1700
01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:56.377
GARRISON: Robert, I'm
not putting her up there.

1701
01:18:01.516 --> 01:18:04.385
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an
honor. Please, take a seat.

1702
01:18:04.419 --> 01:18:08.022
No need, um, I just wanted
to check whether I should

1703
01:18:08.056 --> 01:18:10.225
talk to Lomanitz while I'm
here, given your concerns.

1704
01:18:10.258 --> 01:18:12.360
Well, I'd say that's really
up to you, Professor,

1705
01:18:12.393 --> 01:18:14.562
- but I'd be cautious.
- Uh-huh. Understood.

1706
01:18:14.596 --> 01:18:17.332
Oh, and, um, (clears throat)
as regards to the union,

1707
01:18:17.365 --> 01:18:19.133
I wanted to give you
a heads-up on a...

1708
01:18:19.167 --> 01:18:20.502
on a man named Eltenton.

1709
01:18:20.535 --> 01:18:22.036
A heads-up?

1710
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:26.007
Yes, just that he might
merit watching is all.

1711
01:18:26.809 --> 01:18:28.243
Well, I'd love to
get more details.

1712
01:18:28.276 --> 01:18:30.612
Well, I... I have
an appointment now

1713
01:18:30.645 --> 01:18:32.080
and I leave early tomorrow.

1714
01:18:32.113 --> 01:18:33.648
Well, come back as
early as you like.

1715
01:18:33.681 --> 01:18:36.017
Since you haven't time now.

1716
01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:38.520
You went back the next morning.

1717
01:18:38.553 --> 01:18:40.555
I did, I had to, really.

1718
01:18:41.489 --> 01:18:44.092
<i>This time, there
was another man.</i>

1719
01:18:44.759 --> 01:18:46.261
He said his name's Pash.

1720
01:18:46.294 --> 01:18:48.796
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1721
01:18:48.831 --> 01:18:50.374
ROBB: Colonel Pash,
could you please read

1722
01:18:50.398 --> 01:18:54.202
from your memo
dated June 29, 1943?

1723
01:18:56.304 --> 01:18:58.406
PASH: "Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

1724
01:18:58.439 --> 01:19:01.276
"indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

1725
01:19:01.309 --> 01:19:03.478
"Subject met with and
spent considerable time

1726
01:19:03.511 --> 01:19:05.713
"with one Jean
Tatlock, Communist,

1727
01:19:05.747 --> 01:19:07.215
the record of whom is attached."

1728
01:19:07.248 --> 01:19:09.117
The subject being
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1729
01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:11.619
- PASH: Yes.
- ROBB: Whom you had not met?

1730
01:19:11.653 --> 01:19:13.454
PASH: Not then,
but soon after.

1731
01:19:13.488 --> 01:19:14.866
He's the head of
security for the project.

1732
01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:16.124
Shouldn't I know him?

1733
01:19:16.157 --> 01:19:17.492
No, he should know you.

1734
01:19:17.525 --> 01:19:19.427
I would never put you
in a room with Pash.

1735
01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.728
- Why not?
- (sighs)

1736
01:19:20.762 --> 01:19:22.831
When Pash first
heard about Lomanitz,

1737
01:19:22.865 --> 01:19:25.800
he told the FBI he
was gonna kidnap him,

1738
01:19:25.834 --> 01:19:27.302
take him out on a boat

1739
01:19:27.335 --> 01:19:30.338
and interrogate him
in the Russian manner.

1740
01:19:32.473 --> 01:19:35.310
General Groves has placed in
me a certain responsibility,

1741
01:19:35.343 --> 01:19:37.579
and it's like having a
child who I can't see.

1742
01:19:37.612 --> 01:19:39.714
- Ah.
- By remote control.

1743
01:19:39.747 --> 01:19:43.351
- (chuckles quietly)
- So to actually meet you is...

1744
01:19:44.452 --> 01:19:45.897
I won't take up too
much of your time.

1745
01:19:45.921 --> 01:19:48.189
No, no, not at all.
Whatever time you choose.

1746
01:19:48.222 --> 01:19:51.125
Mm. Mr. Johnson told
me of a conversation

1747
01:19:51.159 --> 01:19:52.904
you had yesterday in
which I'm very interested.

1748
01:19:52.928 --> 01:19:55.196
It's had me worried all day.

1749
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:57.732
Yes, well, I didn't
want to talk to Lomanitz

1750
01:19:57.765 --> 01:19:59.300
without authorization.

1751
01:19:59.334 --> 01:20:00.544
That's not the particular
interest that I have.

1752
01:20:00.568 --> 01:20:02.537
It's something a
little bit more...

1753
01:20:03.571 --> 01:20:05.340
well, in my opinion,
more serious.

1754
01:20:05.373 --> 01:20:08.309
Now, when the FBI pointed
out that such information

1755
01:20:08.343 --> 01:20:09.888
wouldn't be admissible in
court, Pash made it clear

1756
01:20:09.912 --> 01:20:13.681
he had no intention of leaving
any witness left to prosecute.

1757
01:20:13.715 --> 01:20:15.283
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1758
01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:16.885
but that's the man
you're dancing with.

1759
01:20:16.919 --> 01:20:19.621
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

1760
01:20:19.654 --> 01:20:22.357
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab.

1761
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:26.294
A man attached to
the Soviet Consul

1762
01:20:26.327 --> 01:20:29.364
indicated, through
intermediate people,

1763
01:20:29.397 --> 01:20:30.933
to people on this project,

1764
01:20:30.966 --> 01:20:34.402
that he was in a position
to transmit information.

1765
01:20:34.435 --> 01:20:37.271
Oh, why would anyone on the
project want to do that?

1766
01:20:38.706 --> 01:20:41.242
Frankly, I can see that
there might be an argument

1767
01:20:41.275 --> 01:20:43.678
for the Commander-in-Chief
informing the Russians...

1768
01:20:43.711 --> 01:20:45.580
they're our allies after all...

1769
01:20:45.613 --> 01:20:48.516
but I don't like the idea of
it going out the back door.

1770
01:20:48.549 --> 01:20:51.285
It might not hurt to be
on the lookout for it.

1771
01:20:52.687 --> 01:20:53.856
And you said that to Pash?

1772
01:20:53.889 --> 01:20:55.390
I was trying to put it

1773
01:20:55.423 --> 01:20:58.259
in a context of
Russia's not Germany.

1774
01:20:58.292 --> 01:21:02.697
Boris Pash is the son of
a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1775
01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:06.234
Born here, but in 1918,
he went back to Russia

1776
01:21:06.267 --> 01:21:07.702
to fight the Bolsheviks.

1777
01:21:07.735 --> 01:21:09.914
This is a man who has killed
Communists with his own hands.

1778
01:21:09.938 --> 01:21:13.408
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

1779
01:21:13.441 --> 01:21:15.486
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

1780
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:17.712
Would you be a
little more specific?

1781
01:21:18.981 --> 01:21:20.548
(smacks lips)

1782
01:21:20.581 --> 01:21:23.451
There's a man whose
name was mentioned to me

1783
01:21:23.484 --> 01:21:25.586
a couple of times. Eltenton.

1784
01:21:26.621 --> 01:21:29.724
Uh, I believe he's a
chemist who works at Shell.

1785
01:21:29.757 --> 01:21:32.293
He talked to a friend of his

1786
01:21:32.326 --> 01:21:36.230
who's an acquaintance of
someone on the project.

1787
01:21:37.465 --> 01:21:39.902
And you thought Pash would
be satisfied with that?

1788
01:21:39.935 --> 01:21:42.470
I was attempting to
give them Eltenton

1789
01:21:42.503 --> 01:21:43.839
without opening a can of worms.

1790
01:21:43.872 --> 01:21:45.841
I told them a
cock-and-bull story.

1791
01:21:45.874 --> 01:21:47.408
Did you lie to
General Groves too?

1792
01:21:47.442 --> 01:21:50.979
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

1793
01:21:51.013 --> 01:21:52.456
GARRISON: Do you recall
this conversation

1794
01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.883
- about the Chevalier incident?
- (scoffs)

1795
01:21:54.917 --> 01:21:57.318
I've seen so many
versions of it. Um...

1796
01:21:57.351 --> 01:21:58.519
Wasn't confused before,

1797
01:21:58.553 --> 01:21:59.988
but I'm certainly
getting there now.

1798
01:22:00.022 --> 01:22:01.331
GARRISON: And what
was your conclusion?

1799
01:22:01.355 --> 01:22:03.725
That he was under
the influence of

1800
01:22:03.758 --> 01:22:06.627
the typical American
schoolboy attitude

1801
01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:10.264
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

1802
01:22:10.298 --> 01:22:12.333
Well, now.

1803
01:22:12.366 --> 01:22:14.802
Might we know through
whom the contact was made?

1804
01:22:14.837 --> 01:22:17.039
That would in... involve people

1805
01:22:17.072 --> 01:22:19.041
who are not to be
involved in this.

1806
01:22:19.074 --> 01:22:21.844
Is that someone a
member of the project?

1807
01:22:21.877 --> 01:22:26.414
A member of the faculty, yes,
but not in the project, no.

1808
01:22:26.447 --> 01:22:27.548
Ah.

1809
01:22:27.582 --> 01:22:29.350
So Eltenton made his approach

1810
01:22:29.383 --> 01:22:32.620
through a member of the
faculty here at Berkeley?

1811
01:22:34.355 --> 01:22:36.825
As far as I know. As
far as I know, yes.

1812
01:22:36.859 --> 01:22:39.494
But there-there may have been

1813
01:22:39.527 --> 01:22:42.263
more than one person involved.

1814
01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:48.871
Gentlemen, if I... if
I seem uncooperative,

1815
01:22:48.904 --> 01:22:51.840
I think you can understand
that's because of my insistence

1816
01:22:51.874 --> 01:22:54.475
in not getting innocent
people into trouble.

1817
01:22:54.509 --> 01:22:56.310
GROVES: <i>You're trying
to protect your friend.</i>

1818
01:22:56.344 --> 01:22:57.578
Who's protecting you?

1819
01:22:57.612 --> 01:22:59.014
Well, you could.

1820
01:22:59.047 --> 01:23:00.381
If you gave me the name.

1821
01:23:00.414 --> 01:23:02.350
If you order me to, I'll do it.

1822
01:23:02.383 --> 01:23:03.417
That's a mistake, Robert.

1823
01:23:03.451 --> 01:23:05.286
You need to volunteer this name.

1824
01:23:06.121 --> 01:23:07.789
ROBB: <i>And did he
give you the name?</i>

1825
01:23:07.823 --> 01:23:08.957
GROVES: <i>He did.</i>

1826
01:23:08.991 --> 01:23:10.458
- ROBB: But not then, did he?
- No.

1827
01:23:10.491 --> 01:23:11.970
No. In fact, it was some
months later, wasn't it?

1828
01:23:11.994 --> 01:23:13.896
It was.

1829
01:23:13.929 --> 01:23:15.030
You see me as persistent.

1830
01:23:15.063 --> 01:23:16.798
Well, you are...

1831
01:23:16.832 --> 01:23:18.666
you are persistent,
but that is your job.

1832
01:23:18.699 --> 01:23:22.403
And-and my job is to protect
the people that work for me.

1833
01:23:22.436 --> 01:23:24.438
PASH: Instead of us
going on certain steps,

1834
01:23:24.472 --> 01:23:26.574
which may come to
your attention...

1835
01:23:27.943 --> 01:23:29.710
and be disturbing to you,

1836
01:23:29.744 --> 01:23:32.848
I would like to discuss
those with you first.

1837
01:23:32.881 --> 01:23:34.382
I'm not formulating a plan.

1838
01:23:34.415 --> 01:23:36.751
I'll just have to
digest the whole thing.

1839
01:23:40.388 --> 01:23:43.091
ROBB: <i>In the months in
between your interview</i>

1840
01:23:43.125 --> 01:23:46.761
with Dr. Oppenheimer and his
eventual naming of Chevalier,

1841
01:23:46.794 --> 01:23:48.096
did you expend resources

1842
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:49.606
trying to find the name
of the intermediary?

1843
01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:52.100
Considerable resources, yes.

1844
01:23:52.134 --> 01:23:54.368
Without the name, our job
was extremely difficult.

1845
01:23:54.402 --> 01:23:55.838
And when did you
receive the name?

1846
01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:57.105
I was gone by the time

1847
01:23:57.139 --> 01:23:59.574
-Oppenheimer finally offered it up.
-Gone?

1848
01:23:59.607 --> 01:24:01.776
They felt my time would
be better spent in Europe

1849
01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:04.545
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

1850
01:24:04.579 --> 01:24:05.746
Who did?

1851
01:24:06.849 --> 01:24:08.583
General Groves.

1852
01:24:08.616 --> 01:24:10.384
He transferred me to London.

1853
01:24:16.825 --> 01:24:18.927
SERBER: <i>It's a little early
for a Christmas party.</i>

1854
01:24:18.961 --> 01:24:20.963
Something's up.

1855
01:24:20.996 --> 01:24:23.031
Tolman's been away.

1856
01:24:23.065 --> 01:24:24.765
Where?

1857
01:24:24.799 --> 01:24:26.367
Ruth won't tell.

1858
01:24:28.904 --> 01:24:30.873
(lively chatter and laughter)

1859
01:24:30.906 --> 01:24:31.907
Hey!

1860
01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:33.641
(playing upbeat music)

1861
01:24:36.078 --> 01:24:37.612
Come on, Ruthie.

1862
01:24:37.645 --> 01:24:39.714
Can't tell me, who can you tell?

1863
01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:42.483
RUTH: Compartmentalization,
Oppie.

1864
01:24:42.516 --> 01:24:43.895
What makes you think I
know where he is anyway?

1865
01:24:43.919 --> 01:24:45.620
ROBERT: 'Cause you
do a pretty good job

1866
01:24:45.653 --> 01:24:48.422
of knowing where Mr. Tolman
is when it counts.

1867
01:24:48.456 --> 01:24:49.992
Like now?

1868
01:24:50.025 --> 01:24:53.461
GROVES: Attention!

1869
01:24:53.494 --> 01:24:55.396
(chatter and music subside)

1870
01:24:56.664 --> 01:24:58.599
Early Christmas
present for you all.

1871
01:25:00.002 --> 01:25:02.803
(applause)

1872
01:25:02.838 --> 01:25:05.406
(crowd cheering)

1873
01:25:06.674 --> 01:25:09.044
BOHR: <i>The British pilots
put me in the bomb bay.</i>

1874
01:25:09.077 --> 01:25:11.079
Showed me the-the
oxygen, you know,

1875
01:25:11.113 --> 01:25:12.848
- but I messed it up.
- (crowd laughs)

1876
01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:15.483
Uh, when they opened me up in
Scotland, I was unconscious.

1877
01:25:15.516 --> 01:25:17.718
But I pretended
I'd been napping.

1878
01:25:17.752 --> 01:25:18.653
(crowd laughing)

1879
01:25:18.686 --> 01:25:20.122
Please enjoy your party.

1880
01:25:20.155 --> 01:25:21.455
(light applause)

1881
01:25:21.489 --> 01:25:22.790
(whispering): Is
it big enough?

1882
01:25:22.824 --> 01:25:24.092
To end the war?

1883
01:25:24.126 --> 01:25:27.029
To end all war.

1884
01:25:28.562 --> 01:25:29.831
(intriguing music playing)

1885
01:25:29.865 --> 01:25:33.936
Uh, Heisenberg sought
me out in Copenhagen.

1886
01:25:33.969 --> 01:25:35.703
It was chilling,

1887
01:25:35.736 --> 01:25:37.772
my old student
working for the Nazis.

1888
01:25:37.806 --> 01:25:41.709
He told me some
things to draw me out.

1889
01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:45.948
Sustained fission
reactions in uranium.

1890
01:25:45.981 --> 01:25:48.183
That sounds more like
a reactor than a bomb.

1891
01:25:48.216 --> 01:25:49.650
Did he mention
gaseous diffusion?

1892
01:25:49.684 --> 01:25:51.954
He seemed more focused
on heavy water.

1893
01:25:51.987 --> 01:25:53.688
As a moderator?

1894
01:25:53.721 --> 01:25:55.090
Yes, instead of graphite.

1895
01:25:55.123 --> 01:25:57.458
- (Teller snorts)
- (laughter)

1896
01:25:58.126 --> 01:25:59.493
What?

1897
01:25:59.527 --> 01:26:01.696
He took a wrong turn.

1898
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:04.199
We're ahead. And with you
here to help us, Niels.

1899
01:26:04.232 --> 01:26:06.500
Sorry, could you...

1900
01:26:06.534 --> 01:26:09.470
could you give us a
moment, gentlemen?

1901
01:26:15.643 --> 01:26:18.180
I am not here to help, Robert.

1902
01:26:18.213 --> 01:26:20.115
I knew you could
do this without me.

1903
01:26:20.148 --> 01:26:21.249
Then why did you come?

1904
01:26:21.283 --> 01:26:22.717
BOHR: To talk about after.

1905
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:24.719
The power you're about to reveal

1906
01:26:24.752 --> 01:26:26.955
will forever outlive the Nazis.

1907
01:26:28.023 --> 01:26:29.623
And the world is not prepared.

1908
01:26:29.657 --> 01:26:31.059
"You could lift the stone

1909
01:26:31.093 --> 01:26:33.728
without being ready for
the snake that's revealed."

1910
01:26:33.761 --> 01:26:35.139
We have to make the
politicians understand,

1911
01:26:35.163 --> 01:26:37.265
this isn't a new weapon.

1912
01:26:37.299 --> 01:26:38.766
It's a new world.

1913
01:26:38.799 --> 01:26:42.170
I'll be out there doing
what I can, but you...

1914
01:26:42.204 --> 01:26:44.772
you're an American Prometheus.

1915
01:26:44.806 --> 01:26:47.042
The man who gave them the power

1916
01:26:47.075 --> 01:26:49.111
to destroy themselves,

1917
01:26:49.144 --> 01:26:50.778
and they'll respect that.

1918
01:26:50.812 --> 01:26:52.981
And your work really begins.

1919
01:26:56.918 --> 01:27:00.055
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

1920
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:03.925
From San Francisco.

1921
01:27:03.959 --> 01:27:06.028
(somber music playing)

1922
01:27:10.198 --> 01:27:11.900
Robert!

1923
01:27:15.137 --> 01:27:16.670
Robert?

1924
01:27:17.339 --> 01:27:19.908
Robert. Robert.

1925
01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:22.144
- God, what's the matter?
- (grunts softly)

1926
01:27:22.177 --> 01:27:23.945
- What happened?
- (sighs)

1927
01:27:24.813 --> 01:27:26.747
ROBERT: Her father called.

1928
01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:28.917
They found her
yesterday in the bath.

1929
01:27:29.918 --> 01:27:31.053
Who?

1930
01:27:32.054 --> 01:27:34.056
She'd taken pills.

1931
01:27:34.089 --> 01:27:35.991
<i>Left a note, not signed.</i>

1932
01:27:36.992 --> 01:27:37.959
She took barbiturates,

1933
01:27:37.993 --> 01:27:39.928
but there was chloral
hydrate in her blood.

1934
01:27:39.961 --> 01:27:41.329
(muffled screaming)

1935
01:27:41.363 --> 01:27:43.265
(screaming stops)

1936
01:27:43.298 --> 01:27:44.632
There was a note.

1937
01:27:44.665 --> 01:27:46.968
(whispering): Jean Tatlock?

1938
01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.742
We were together.

1939
01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:57.578
She said she needed me. I...

1940
01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.616
I told her I... I
wouldn't... (shudders)

1941
01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:04.286
I told her I couldn't...

1942
01:28:04.319 --> 01:28:05.987
No, it was... it was me.

1943
01:28:07.788 --> 01:28:08.957
(Kitty breathing heavily)

1944
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:11.093
You don't get to commit the sin

1945
01:28:11.126 --> 01:28:12.928
and then have us all
feel sorry for you

1946
01:28:12.961 --> 01:28:15.831
that it had consequences.
(breath shuddering)

1947
01:28:17.899 --> 01:28:20.102
- You pull yourself together.
- (sniffling)

1948
01:28:23.771 --> 01:28:25.907
You know, people
here depend on you.

1949
01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:29.878
SERBER: Donald, would you like

1950
01:28:29.911 --> 01:28:30.988
to contribute here?
Please, help me out.

1951
01:28:31.012 --> 01:28:32.223
HORNIG: You're
on your own, pal.

1952
01:28:32.247 --> 01:28:33.357
Bob, I'm not quitting my job

1953
01:28:33.381 --> 01:28:34.715
because plutonium
is radioactive.

1954
01:28:34.748 --> 01:28:36.284
We just don't know
what it might do

1955
01:28:36.318 --> 01:28:38.053
to the female
reproductive system...

1956
01:28:38.086 --> 01:28:39.997
Your reproductive system is more
exposed than mine, presumably.

1957
01:28:40.021 --> 01:28:42.891
Can we please? The
implosion device is nowhere.

1958
01:28:42.924 --> 01:28:44.326
Hey, you can't rush everything.

1959
01:28:44.359 --> 01:28:45.903
- Oppie, please.
- Well, there's rushing

1960
01:28:45.927 --> 01:28:47.728
and there's getting on
with it, so pick one.

1961
01:28:47.761 --> 01:28:49.763
Wait. Neddermeyer's
doing his job.

1962
01:28:49.797 --> 01:28:50.731
Teller's not helping.

1963
01:28:50.764 --> 01:28:52.300
You're not helping.

1964
01:28:52.334 --> 01:28:53.734
I've been asking
for calculations

1965
01:28:53.767 --> 01:28:54.912
on the implosion
lenses for weeks.

1966
01:28:54.936 --> 01:28:56.404
The British can do it. Fuchs.

1967
01:28:56.438 --> 01:28:57.738
Absolutely.

1968
01:28:57.771 --> 01:28:59.141
It's your job, Teller.

1969
01:28:59.174 --> 01:29:00.976
I'm engaged in research.

1970
01:29:01.009 --> 01:29:03.677
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

1971
01:29:03.711 --> 01:29:05.147
(others laughing)

1972
01:29:11.785 --> 01:29:13.155
I won't work for that man.

1973
01:29:13.188 --> 01:29:14.890
(others exclaim)

1974
01:29:14.923 --> 01:29:17.025
Let him go. He's a prima donna.

1975
01:29:17.058 --> 01:29:19.294
SERBER: I agree. He
should leave Los Alamos.

1976
01:29:19.327 --> 01:29:20.829
Okay.

1977
01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:22.730
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.

1978
01:29:22.763 --> 01:29:24.166
Seth, I'm putting
you on plutonium.

1979
01:29:24.199 --> 01:29:27.302
Lilli, you go work for
Kisty. Because he needs you.

1980
01:29:27.335 --> 01:29:29.905
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1981
01:29:29.938 --> 01:29:32.307
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

1982
01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:36.111
And no one is
leaving Los Alamos.

1983
01:29:36.144 --> 01:29:38.880
(rousing music playing)

1984
01:29:50.358 --> 01:29:52.327
- They won't let me leave.
- ROBERT: No.

1985
01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.962
I won't let you leave.

1986
01:29:54.829 --> 01:29:57.933
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

1987
01:29:57.966 --> 01:30:01.102
Stay here, research
what you want.

1988
01:30:01.136 --> 01:30:03.737
Fusion, the hydrogen
bomb, whatever.

1989
01:30:03.771 --> 01:30:04.940
We'll meet to discuss.

1990
01:30:04.973 --> 01:30:06.441
You don't have time to meet.

1991
01:30:06.474 --> 01:30:08.043
You're a politician now, Robert.

1992
01:30:08.076 --> 01:30:10.711
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

1993
01:30:11.546 --> 01:30:13.348
Once a week.

1994
01:30:13.381 --> 01:30:15.250
One hour. You and me.

1995
01:30:20.422 --> 01:30:22.991
Now raise this fucking barrier.

1996
01:30:26.928 --> 01:30:29.364
ROBB: <i>So the Super
was under development</i>

1997
01:30:29.397 --> 01:30:31.366
<i>on your watch at Los Alamos?</i>

1998
01:30:31.399 --> 01:30:32.901
Yes.

1999
01:30:32.934 --> 01:30:34.802
ROBB: And yet, after the war,

2000
01:30:34.836 --> 01:30:36.438
you tried to deny it was viable.

2001
01:30:36.471 --> 01:30:37.973
No, no, no. I...

2002
01:30:38.006 --> 01:30:39.841
I pointed out technical
difficulties with it.

2003
01:30:39.874 --> 01:30:41.519
You... Didn't you try to
kill it at the AEC meeting

2004
01:30:41.543 --> 01:30:43.111
- after the Russian bomb test?
- No.

2005
01:30:43.144 --> 01:30:45.247
ROBB: But that was the
recommendation of the AEC,

2006
01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:47.549
- was it not?
- After hours of discussion

2007
01:30:47.582 --> 01:30:49.851
<i>about the best response.</i>

2008
01:30:49.884 --> 01:30:54.990
An H-bomb is 1,000 times
the power of an A-bomb.

2009
01:30:56.157 --> 01:30:59.928
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

2010
01:30:59.961 --> 01:31:02.063
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

2011
01:31:02.097 --> 01:31:04.399
Izzy, draw some circles
on this side of the map

2012
01:31:04.432 --> 01:31:06.067
where they would target us.

2013
01:31:06.101 --> 01:31:08.136
- Starting with New York. D.C.
- RABI: That's fair.

2014
01:31:08.169 --> 01:31:10.939
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

2015
01:31:10.972 --> 01:31:12.507
- Deterrence.
- BUSH: "Deterrence"?

2016
01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.142
Do we really need
more deterrence

2017
01:31:14.175 --> 01:31:16.578
than our current
arsenal of atomic bombs?

2018
01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:19.314
Y-You drown in ten feet
of water or-or 10,000,

2019
01:31:19.347 --> 01:31:21.025
- what's the difference?
- (rhythmic stomping)

2020
01:31:21.049 --> 01:31:23.018
We can already drown
Russia. They know it.

2021
01:31:23.051 --> 01:31:25.329
- And now they can drown us.
- So we're just escalating...

2022
01:31:25.353 --> 01:31:27.155
(stomping intensifying)

2023
01:31:27.188 --> 01:31:29.391
(discussion continues
indistinctly)

2024
01:31:33.228 --> 01:31:34.829
(stomping stops)

2025
01:31:36.231 --> 01:31:39.067
As I said, Teller's
designs are still as

2026
01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.036
impractical as they
were during the war.

2027
01:31:41.069 --> 01:31:44.039
A hydrogen bomb can be made
to work, Oppie, you know that.

2028
01:31:44.072 --> 01:31:45.216
I don't believe we should commit

2029
01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.142
all our resources
to that chance.

2030
01:31:47.175 --> 01:31:50.045
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

2031
01:31:50.078 --> 01:31:52.280
Simply by limiting the
spread of atomic weapons

2032
01:31:52.314 --> 01:31:55.617
through international
control on nuclear energy.

2033
01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:57.218
By which you mean
world government?

2034
01:31:57.252 --> 01:32:00.188
The United Nations as
Roosevelt intended.

2035
01:32:00.221 --> 01:32:03.124
Well, I... I asked what
Truman should do, right?

2036
01:32:03.158 --> 01:32:06.061
The world's changed, it's
not fascism but Communism

2037
01:32:06.094 --> 01:32:07.562
that now threatens our survival.

2038
01:32:07.595 --> 01:32:11.232
Lewis, do you understand,
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

2039
01:32:11.266 --> 01:32:14.135
the Russians will have no
choice but to build their own?

2040
01:32:14.169 --> 01:32:15.937
Could they be working
on one already?

2041
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:18.473
Based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos.

2042
01:32:18.506 --> 01:32:19.974
No spy at Los Alamos.

2043
01:32:20.008 --> 01:32:21.085
- Gentlemen.
- There wasn't?

2044
01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:22.344
Let's not get sidetracked.

2045
01:32:22.377 --> 01:32:24.079
I say we use this moment

2046
01:32:24.112 --> 01:32:25.523
to gain concessions
from the Russians

2047
01:32:25.547 --> 01:32:28.616
by committing that we will
not build a hydrogen bomb.

2048
01:32:28.650 --> 01:32:30.285
Thereby revealing its existence.

2049
01:32:30.318 --> 01:32:32.320
Which you seem convinced
they already know.

2050
01:32:32.354 --> 01:32:33.955
(clears throat) All right.

2051
01:32:33.988 --> 01:32:36.091
At this point, I'd like
the committee members

2052
01:32:36.124 --> 01:32:40.061
to meet in privacy to
finalize our recommendations.

2053
01:32:41.196 --> 01:32:43.198
I'm just not sure you
want to go down this road.

2054
01:32:43.231 --> 01:32:45.500
Lewis, with respect, we
are the advisory committee,

2055
01:32:45.533 --> 01:32:47.302
we will give them our advice.

2056
01:32:47.335 --> 01:32:48.436
STRAUSS: Good night.

2057
01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.911
Dr. Oppenheimer?
Hi. William Borden.

2058
01:32:56.945 --> 01:32:58.279
Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy?

2059
01:32:58.313 --> 01:32:59.514
Oh, yes, yes.

2060
01:32:59.547 --> 01:33:01.182
During the war, I was a pilot.

2061
01:33:02.317 --> 01:33:05.053
One night, flying
back from a raid,

2062
01:33:05.086 --> 01:33:07.989
I saw an amazing
sight like a meteor.

2063
01:33:08.022 --> 01:33:09.157
(engine rumbling)

2064
01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:11.960
<i>A V-2 rocket headed to England.</i>

2065
01:33:11.993 --> 01:33:13.995
I can't help but
imagine what it will be

2066
01:33:14.028 --> 01:33:17.932
for such an enemy rocket
to carry an atomic warhead.

2067
01:33:17.966 --> 01:33:20.034
(rhythmic stomping)

2068
01:33:20.668 --> 01:33:21.603
(rocket engine rumbling)

2069
01:33:21.636 --> 01:33:24.205
(stomping intensifying)

2070
01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:25.239
(stomping stops)

2071
01:33:26.708 --> 01:33:28.052
Well, let's make sure
we're not the ones

2072
01:33:28.076 --> 01:33:29.377
to make that possible.

2073
01:33:36.084 --> 01:33:38.987
Oppie, I don't think you want
to go up against Strauss.

2074
01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.089
If we both speak,
they listen to me.

2075
01:33:41.122 --> 01:33:43.191
When you speak,
they hear a prophet.

2076
01:33:43.224 --> 01:33:45.193
When Strauss speaks,
they hear themselves.

2077
01:33:45.226 --> 01:33:47.028
They'll listen to a prophet.

2078
01:33:47.061 --> 01:33:50.331
A prophet can't be
wrong. Not once.

2079
01:33:50.365 --> 01:33:52.133
SENATOR McGEE: <i>Didn't
you accuse Oppenheimer</i>

2080
01:33:52.167 --> 01:33:54.068
<i>of sabotaging the
development of the Super?</i>

2081
01:33:54.102 --> 01:33:55.703
I was never one of those

2082
01:33:55.737 --> 01:33:59.007
to bandy around terms
like "sabotage."

2083
01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.009
SENATOR McGEE: <i>But
Mr. Borden was?</i>

2084
01:34:01.042 --> 01:34:02.310
As I understand it, possibly.

2085
01:34:02.343 --> 01:34:04.446
How was Mr. Borden
able to put together

2086
01:34:04.479 --> 01:34:05.747
such a detailed indictment?

2087
01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.315
<i>He was no longer a
government employee,</i>

2088
01:34:07.348 --> 01:34:09.984
yet he appears to have
had unlimited access

2089
01:34:10.018 --> 01:34:11.519
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

2090
01:34:11.553 --> 01:34:14.456
<i>Might Mr. Nichols have given
him access to the file?</i>

2091
01:34:14.489 --> 01:34:16.391
Or someone else, at the AEC?

2092
01:34:16.424 --> 01:34:19.260
That's a very serious
accusation, Senator.

2093
01:34:19.294 --> 01:34:21.763
Is it your intention to
suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer

2094
01:34:21.796 --> 01:34:23.731
is disloyal to
the United States?

2095
01:34:23.765 --> 01:34:26.301
I've always assumed,
and still assume,

2096
01:34:26.334 --> 01:34:29.037
that he's loyal to
the United States.

2097
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:30.514
I believe this. And
I shall believe it

2098
01:34:30.538 --> 01:34:33.341
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

2099
01:34:33.374 --> 01:34:35.143
ROBB: <i>Do you or
do you not believe</i>

2100
01:34:35.176 --> 01:34:37.545
<i>that Dr. Oppenheimer
is a security risk?</i>

2101
01:34:38.646 --> 01:34:41.115
(suspenseful music plays)

2102
01:34:45.753 --> 01:34:47.388
PHILIP MORRISON: And if I may,

2103
01:34:47.422 --> 01:34:50.225
when Hitler blew his
brains out in that bunker,

2104
01:34:50.258 --> 01:34:51.803
it's my humble opinion
that there is no need

2105
01:34:51.827 --> 01:34:53.294
for that bomb to
be seen anywhere

2106
01:34:53.328 --> 01:34:55.096
- except for that test site.
- (applause)

2107
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:57.131
HORNIG: But we at least
have to take a moment

2108
01:34:57.165 --> 01:34:59.167
to think about whether the means

2109
01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.469
justify the ends any
longer, because...

2110
01:35:03.805 --> 01:35:06.374
Germany is about to surrender.

2111
01:35:06.407 --> 01:35:08.243
(applause)

2112
01:35:08.276 --> 01:35:11.613
It's no longer the enemy
who are the greatest threat

2113
01:35:11.646 --> 01:35:13.448
to mankind, it's our work.

2114
01:35:13.481 --> 01:35:15.149
(people murmur)

2115
01:35:15.851 --> 01:35:18.586
Hitler's dead, it's true.

2116
01:35:20.288 --> 01:35:21.824
But the Japanese fight on.

2117
01:35:21.857 --> 01:35:23.525
Their defeat seems assured.

2118
01:35:23.558 --> 01:35:26.561
Not if you're a G.I.
preparing to invade.

2119
01:35:27.863 --> 01:35:29.163
We can end this war.

2120
01:35:29.197 --> 01:35:30.598
MORRISON: But
how do we justify

2121
01:35:30.632 --> 01:35:32.200
using this weapon
on human beings?

2122
01:35:32.233 --> 01:35:34.168
- (murmurs of assent)
- (scattered applause)

2123
01:35:35.236 --> 01:35:38.640
We're theorists, yes?

2124
01:35:38.673 --> 01:35:40.275
PEOPLE: Yes. Yep.

2125
01:35:40.308 --> 01:35:44.345
We imagine a future and
our imaginings horrify us.

2126
01:35:45.413 --> 01:35:47.549
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

2127
01:35:47.582 --> 01:35:50.485
and they won't understand
it until they've used it.

2128
01:35:50.518 --> 01:35:51.686
When the world learns

2129
01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:54.222
the terrible secret
of Los Alamos,

2130
01:35:54.255 --> 01:35:57.692
our work here will ensure a
peace mankind has never seen.

2131
01:35:57.725 --> 01:36:01.095
A peace based on the kind
of international cooperation

2132
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:03.164
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

2133
01:36:03.197 --> 01:36:05.300
(scattered applause)

2134
01:36:08.269 --> 01:36:09.504
ROBERT: <i>Progress?</i>

2135
01:36:09.537 --> 01:36:12.307
Two years and a
billion dollars' worth?

2136
01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:14.108
Well, hard to put a price on it.

2137
01:36:14.142 --> 01:36:15.710
Not really, just
add up the bills.

2138
01:36:15.743 --> 01:36:17.445
"Rural free deliveries."

2139
01:36:17.478 --> 01:36:20.248
Eighty babies delivered
the first year.

2140
01:36:20.281 --> 01:36:22.617
This year, we've
had ten a month.

2141
01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:25.386
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

2142
01:36:26.254 --> 01:36:28.590
- GROVES: Clearly.
- KITTY: General.

2143
01:36:28.623 --> 01:36:30.525
(thrilling music playing)

2144
01:36:33.561 --> 01:36:34.897
Head down, everyone.

2145
01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:37.098
Fuchs, head down.

2146
01:36:39.601 --> 01:36:40.768
Hmm? (sniffs)

2147
01:36:40.802 --> 01:36:41.803
(spool winds)

2148
01:36:41.837 --> 01:36:43.605
(explosion)

2149
01:36:43.638 --> 01:36:45.373
That's the one. (grunts)

2150
01:36:45.406 --> 01:36:48.309
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

2151
01:36:50.612 --> 01:36:52.447
September.

2152
01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.481
July.

2153
01:36:53.514 --> 01:36:55.450
That's the sweet
spot, gentlemen.

2154
01:36:55.483 --> 01:36:57.652
August.

2155
01:36:57.685 --> 01:36:59.420
July.

2156
01:36:59.454 --> 01:37:01.255
Test in July.

2157
01:37:01.289 --> 01:37:02.925
But I need my brother.

2158
01:37:02.958 --> 01:37:05.460
(thrilling music continues)

2159
01:37:07.295 --> 01:37:09.239
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

2160
01:37:09.263 --> 01:37:11.699
he's been working with
Lawrence for two years now.

2161
01:37:18.673 --> 01:37:20.508
What do we call the test?

2162
01:37:21.609 --> 01:37:25.380
"Batter my heart,
three-person'd god."

2163
01:37:25.413 --> 01:37:26.514
What?

2164
01:37:27.883 --> 01:37:29.283
Trinity.

2165
01:37:36.959 --> 01:37:38.326
ROBB: You insisted

2166
01:37:38.359 --> 01:37:39.670
on bringing on
your brother Frank,

2167
01:37:39.694 --> 01:37:41.305
- a known Communist.
- A former Communist.

2168
01:37:41.329 --> 01:37:43.765
You brought a known
former Communist

2169
01:37:43.798 --> 01:37:47.669
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

2170
01:37:47.702 --> 01:37:50.805
I knew my brother could
be trusted. Absolutely.

2171
01:37:50.839 --> 01:37:52.808
And you felt your
judgment was sound

2172
01:37:52.841 --> 01:37:54.676
on who on the team
could be trusted?

2173
01:37:55.677 --> 01:37:56.812
Fuchs, head down.

2174
01:37:56.845 --> 01:37:58.579
Okay, everybody ready?

2175
01:37:59.948 --> 01:38:01.884
Hmm? (sniffs)

2176
01:38:01.917 --> 01:38:03.685
- (spool winds)
- Oh.

2177
01:38:03.718 --> 01:38:05.319
(explosion)

2178
01:38:06.822 --> 01:38:07.956
Oh.

2179
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:09.724
Well, I hope you
learned something.

2180
01:38:09.757 --> 01:38:11.669
Yeah, we learned we're gonna
need to be a lot further away.

2181
01:38:11.693 --> 01:38:13.261
Well, figure it out. Fast.

2182
01:38:13.294 --> 01:38:14.963
We leave for Washington
in the morning.

2183
01:38:14.997 --> 01:38:17.198
We're gonna give them a date.

2184
01:38:22.737 --> 01:38:24.439
(telephones ringing)

2185
01:38:31.345 --> 01:38:33.015
You're a long way
from Chicago, Leo.

2186
01:38:33.048 --> 01:38:34.549
If we don't act now,

2187
01:38:34.582 --> 01:38:36.293
they're going to use
this thing against Japan.

2188
01:38:36.317 --> 01:38:38.286
We booked a meeting with Truman,

2189
01:38:38.319 --> 01:38:39.587
but somebody killed it.

2190
01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.489
You're meeting the
Secretary of War.

2191
01:38:41.522 --> 01:38:43.691
Just because we're building it,

2192
01:38:43.725 --> 01:38:45.727
doesn't mean we get to
decide how it's used.

2193
01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:48.529
History will judge us, Robert.

2194
01:38:48.563 --> 01:38:51.867
In Chicago, we put
together a petition.

2195
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.836
I'm not... I'm not
getting into that.

2196
01:38:53.869 --> 01:38:55.603
(clattering)

2197
01:38:55.636 --> 01:38:57.338
(sighs)

2198
01:38:58.907 --> 01:39:00.843
Just tell me your concerns,
and I'll relay them.

2199
01:39:00.876 --> 01:39:01.977
My concerns?

2200
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:03.979
Germany's defeated.

2201
01:39:04.012 --> 01:39:05.780
Japan's not going
to hold out alone.

2202
01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:07.715
How could you know that?
You got us into this.

2203
01:39:07.749 --> 01:39:09.526
You and Einstein with
your letter to Roosevelt

2204
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:12.353
- saying we could build a bomb.
- (scoffs) Against Germany.

2205
01:39:12.386 --> 01:39:15.323
That's not how weapons
manufacture works, Szilard.

2206
01:39:15.356 --> 01:39:16.500
SZILARD: Oppie,
you have to help.

2207
01:39:16.524 --> 01:39:17.826
ROBERT: Fermi's
in the meeting.

2208
01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.436
- Lawrence is in the meeting.
- They're not you.

2209
01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.629
You're the great
salesman of science.

2210
01:39:21.662 --> 01:39:24.265
You can convince
anyone of anything.

2211
01:39:24.967 --> 01:39:26.367
Even yourself.

2212
01:39:26.969 --> 01:39:28.369
'Scuse me.

2213
01:39:29.403 --> 01:39:32.673
The firestorm in Tokyo
killed 100,000 people.

2214
01:39:32.707 --> 01:39:34.509
Mostly civilians.

2215
01:39:34.542 --> 01:39:37.079
I worry about an America
where we do these things

2216
01:39:37.112 --> 01:39:38.847
and no one protests.

2217
01:39:38.881 --> 01:39:41.917
Pearl Harbor and three years of
brutal conflict in the Pacific

2218
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:44.485
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

2219
01:39:44.519 --> 01:39:46.554
STIMSON: Enough to
unleash the atomic bomb?

2220
01:39:46.587 --> 01:39:48.456
FERMI: Uh, the A-bomb
might not cause

2221
01:39:48.489 --> 01:39:50.391
as much damage as
the Tokyo bombings.

2222
01:39:50.424 --> 01:39:51.793
What are we estimating?

2223
01:39:51.827 --> 01:39:54.662
In a medium-size city, uh,

2224
01:39:54.695 --> 01:39:56.098
20 or 30,000 dead.

2225
01:39:56.131 --> 01:39:57.933
ROBERT: Yes, but, uh,

2226
01:39:57.966 --> 01:40:01.003
don't underestimate the
psychological impact of a...

2227
01:40:01.036 --> 01:40:02.436
of an atomic explosion.

2228
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:06.707
A pillar of fire
10,000 feet tall.

2229
01:40:06.741 --> 01:40:10.078
Deadly neutron effects for
a mile, in all directions,

2230
01:40:10.112 --> 01:40:13.015
from one single device.

2231
01:40:13.048 --> 01:40:15.383
Dropped from a
barely noticed B-29,

2232
01:40:15.416 --> 01:40:17.685
the atomic bomb will be

2233
01:40:17.718 --> 01:40:20.555
a terrible revelation
of divine power.

2234
01:40:20.588 --> 01:40:23.859
If that's true, it
would be definitive.

2235
01:40:23.892 --> 01:40:25.961
World War II would be over.

2236
01:40:25.994 --> 01:40:27.695
Our boys would come home.

2237
01:40:27.728 --> 01:40:28.864
Military targets?

2238
01:40:29.998 --> 01:40:32.667
Uh, there aren't any big enough.

2239
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:38.472
Perhaps a vital war plant
with workers housed nearby.

2240
01:40:38.506 --> 01:40:40.843
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

2241
01:40:40.876 --> 01:40:43.045
They'd send everything
they have up against us,

2242
01:40:43.078 --> 01:40:44.679
and I'd be up in that plane.

2243
01:40:44.712 --> 01:40:47.916
But if we announce it
and it fails to go off,

2244
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:50.651
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

2245
01:40:50.685 --> 01:40:53.788
Is there no way to
demonstrate a bomb to Japan

2246
01:40:53.822 --> 01:40:55.523
to provoke surrender?

2247
01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:58.626
We intend to demonstrate it
in the most unambiguous terms.

2248
01:40:58.659 --> 01:40:59.360
Twice.

2249
01:40:59.393 --> 01:41:01.462
Once to show the weapon's power

2250
01:41:01.495 --> 01:41:03.999
and a second to show that
we can keep doing this

2251
01:41:04.032 --> 01:41:05.533
until they surrender.

2252
01:41:05.566 --> 01:41:08.937
We have a list of 12
cities to choose from...

2253
01:41:08.971 --> 01:41:10.873
Sorry, 11.

2254
01:41:10.906 --> 01:41:12.607
I've taken Kyoto off the list

2255
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.444
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

2256
01:41:16.477 --> 01:41:19.114
Also, my wife and I
honeymooned there.

2257
01:41:19.147 --> 01:41:20.648
It's a magnificent city.

2258
01:41:24.219 --> 01:41:25.921
Let me make this simple
for you, gentlemen.

2259
01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:28.456
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

2260
01:41:28.489 --> 01:41:30.926
the Japanese people
will not surrender

2261
01:41:30.959 --> 01:41:32.727
under any circumstances

2262
01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:36.164
short of a successful and total
invasion of the home islands.

2263
01:41:36.198 --> 01:41:39.167
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

2264
01:41:39.201 --> 01:41:41.435
The use of the atomic
bomb on Japanese cities

2265
01:41:41.469 --> 01:41:43.437
will save lives.

2266
01:41:43.471 --> 01:41:45.773
If we retain moral advantage.

2267
01:41:45.807 --> 01:41:47.943
- How so?
- Well, if we use this weapon

2268
01:41:47.976 --> 01:41:50.913
without informing our allies,
they'll see it as a threat.

2269
01:41:50.946 --> 01:41:52.114
And we'll be in an arms race.

2270
01:41:52.147 --> 01:41:54.216
How open can we be
with the Soviets?

2271
01:41:54.249 --> 01:41:55.817
BUSH: Secrecy won't
stop the Soviets

2272
01:41:55.851 --> 01:41:58.220
from becoming part
of the atomic world.

2273
01:41:58.253 --> 01:42:00.554
We've been told they
have no uranium.

2274
01:42:00.588 --> 01:42:01.789
You've been misinformed.

2275
01:42:01.823 --> 01:42:03.658
A Russian bomb is
a matter of time.

2276
01:42:03.691 --> 01:42:07.095
The program needs to continue
at full pace after the war.

2277
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:09.730
Uh, Secretary
Stimson, if I may...

2278
01:42:09.764 --> 01:42:13.768
Not all scientists on the
project are in agreement.

2279
01:42:13.801 --> 01:42:16.671
In fact, this might be a moment
to consider other opinions.

2280
01:42:16.704 --> 01:42:18.615
- If you talk a scientist in...
- GROVES: The Manhattan Project

2281
01:42:18.639 --> 01:42:20.008
has been plagued from the start

2282
01:42:20.042 --> 01:42:23.845
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

2283
01:42:23.879 --> 01:42:24.947
and uncertain loyalty.

2284
01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:27.215
One of them just tried to
meet with the president.

2285
01:42:27.249 --> 01:42:29.084
Now, we need these men,

2286
01:42:29.117 --> 01:42:30.651
but as soon as it's practical,

2287
01:42:30.685 --> 01:42:32.955
we should sever any such
scientists from the program.

2288
01:42:32.988 --> 01:42:34.555
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

2289
01:42:35.690 --> 01:42:37.525
MARSHALL: If a Russian
bomb is inevitable,

2290
01:42:37.558 --> 01:42:40.829
perhaps we should invite their
top scientists to Trinity.

2291
01:42:40.862 --> 01:42:43.165
President Truman
has no intention

2292
01:42:43.198 --> 01:42:44.765
of raising expectations

2293
01:42:44.799 --> 01:42:47.601
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

2294
01:42:47.635 --> 01:42:49.004
Informing him of
our breakthrough

2295
01:42:49.037 --> 01:42:50.647
and presenting it as
a means to win the war

2296
01:42:50.671 --> 01:42:53.574
need not make
unkeepable promises.

2297
01:42:53.607 --> 01:42:55.153
But the Potsdam peace
conference in July

2298
01:42:55.177 --> 01:42:57.079
will be President
Truman's last chance

2299
01:42:57.112 --> 01:42:59.247
to have that conversation.

2300
01:42:59.281 --> 01:43:01.183
Can you give us a
working bomb by then?

2301
01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:05.887
Absolutely. We will test
fire before the conference.

2302
01:43:06.754 --> 01:43:09.590
(suspenseful music playing)

2303
01:43:10.624 --> 01:43:13.161
FRANK: <i>Ground zero
observation posts</i>

2304
01:43:13.195 --> 01:43:14.662
<i>at 10,000 yards</i>

2305
01:43:14.695 --> 01:43:16.865
north, south and west.

2306
01:43:16.898 --> 01:43:20.202
- Where do we trigger from?
- Uh, south 10,000.

2307
01:43:20.235 --> 01:43:23.571
And base camp is ten
miles south, here.

2308
01:43:23.604 --> 01:43:26.540
And there's a further
observation post

2309
01:43:26.574 --> 01:43:28.743
on-on that hill 20 miles away.

2310
01:43:28.776 --> 01:43:31.746
What's that, Frank? Trigger
lines already went in.

2311
01:43:31.779 --> 01:43:35.283
The Air Force requested a
line of lights for their B-29.

2312
01:43:35.317 --> 01:43:37.752
What B-29? Our
bomb's on the tower.

2313
01:43:37.785 --> 01:43:39.154
FRANK: They want
to use the test

2314
01:43:39.187 --> 01:43:41.023
to confirm a safe
operating distance.

2315
01:43:41.056 --> 01:43:42.290
That's risky.

2316
01:43:42.324 --> 01:43:43.959
Not as risky as
dropping one over Japan

2317
01:43:43.992 --> 01:43:45.769
and hoping that we were
right about the blast radius.

2318
01:43:45.793 --> 01:43:47.905
Don't let them slow us down,
we're firing on the 15th.

2319
01:43:47.929 --> 01:43:51.166
- The 15th? That's not...
- GROVES: The 15th.

2320
01:43:51.199 --> 01:43:53.534
The 15th.

2321
01:43:54.635 --> 01:43:56.580
ROBERT: So I'll be here
at South Observation point

2322
01:43:56.604 --> 01:43:58.807
<i>with Frank and Kistiakowsky.</i>

2323
01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.343
You'll all be
assigned to Base Camp,

2324
01:44:01.376 --> 01:44:04.578
West Observation
or Far Observation.

2325
01:44:04.612 --> 01:44:07.681
(suspenseful music continues)

2326
01:44:14.222 --> 01:44:16.124
Whoa, whoa. Careful
with the knife.

2327
01:44:16.158 --> 01:44:18.592
There, carefully.

2328
01:44:19.693 --> 01:44:21.229
Are those safe distances?

2329
01:44:21.263 --> 01:44:23.764
They're based on
your calculations.

2330
01:44:23.798 --> 01:44:26.700
Time to stand behind your
science, Hans. Literally.

2331
01:44:28.769 --> 01:44:30.906
(suspenseful music continues)

2332
01:44:50.125 --> 01:44:51.592
KISTIAKOWSKY: Yeah.

2333
01:44:56.264 --> 01:44:58.100
What 'bout the radiation cloud?

2334
01:44:58.133 --> 01:44:59.367
Without high winds,

2335
01:44:59.401 --> 01:45:00.978
it should settle within
two to three miles.

2336
01:45:01.002 --> 01:45:03.405
Evacuation measures
are in place.

2337
01:45:03.438 --> 01:45:05.240
But we need good
weather for visibility,

2338
01:45:05.273 --> 01:45:06.740
so it has to be fine.

2339
01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:09.111
KISTIAKOWSKY: Everybody out.

2340
01:45:10.378 --> 01:45:12.680
(suspenseful music continues)

2341
01:45:19.287 --> 01:45:20.431
We go on the night of the 15th.

2342
01:45:20.455 --> 01:45:22.390
It's a hard deadline,

2343
01:45:22.424 --> 01:45:25.726
so if anyone has
anything, speak now.

2344
01:45:26.428 --> 01:45:27.761
Okay, stop, stop.

2345
01:45:27.795 --> 01:45:29.663
Everybody, mattresses.

2346
01:45:29.697 --> 01:45:31.765
Put the mattress underneath.

2347
01:45:48.749 --> 01:45:51.652
Could use a final
implosion test.

2348
01:45:52.354 --> 01:45:54.322
It couldn't hurt.

2349
01:45:54.356 --> 01:45:55.857
Do it.

2350
01:45:56.825 --> 01:45:59.127
Is there anything else
that might stop us?

2351
01:45:59.161 --> 01:46:00.829
(thunder rumbling)

2352
01:46:17.345 --> 01:46:19.981
(suspenseful music continues)

2353
01:46:33.228 --> 01:46:36.131
It's happening, isn't it?

2354
01:46:37.232 --> 01:46:39.000
I'll send a message.

2355
01:46:39.868 --> 01:46:42.504
If it's gone our way,

2356
01:46:42.537 --> 01:46:44.105
take in the sheets.

2357
01:46:48.143 --> 01:46:49.177
Robert?

2358
01:46:51.846 --> 01:46:53.281
Break a leg.

2359
01:46:59.254 --> 01:47:01.423
(suspenseful music continues)

2360
01:47:01.456 --> 01:47:03.892
(explosion)

2361
01:47:07.062 --> 01:47:08.363
(mutters)

2362
01:47:08.396 --> 01:47:10.298
(wind gusting)

2363
01:47:35.523 --> 01:47:37.791
(wind whistling)

2364
01:47:43.064 --> 01:47:44.199
(sighs)

2365
01:47:51.906 --> 01:47:54.075
(thunder rumbling)

2366
01:47:59.848 --> 01:48:02.984
Oppie's taken a very
modest three kilotons.

2367
01:48:03.018 --> 01:48:05.387
- Teller's in with 45.
- RABI: 20.

2368
01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:07.856
Twenty thousand tons of TNT,

2369
01:48:07.889 --> 01:48:09.291
and does anyone
want the side action

2370
01:48:09.324 --> 01:48:12.060
- on atmospheric ignition?
- (all laughing)

2371
01:48:13.028 --> 01:48:15.964
Are you saying
we'll have to delay?

2372
01:48:15.997 --> 01:48:17.174
I'm saying it would be prudent.

2373
01:48:17.198 --> 01:48:18.442
This weather, has
it reached the site?

2374
01:48:18.466 --> 01:48:20.302
(tense music playing)

2375
01:48:20.335 --> 01:48:22.570
(thunder rumbling)

2376
01:48:22.604 --> 01:48:24.239
(telephone ringing)

2377
01:48:24.272 --> 01:48:26.250
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

2378
01:48:26.274 --> 01:48:27.909
ROBERT: Hello, Hans.

2379
01:48:27.942 --> 01:48:29.344
Yes, he's here.

2380
01:48:30.178 --> 01:48:31.513
Yes.

2381
01:48:31.546 --> 01:48:34.049
(thunder rumbling)

2382
01:48:34.082 --> 01:48:35.283
- Is he wrong?
- No.

2383
01:48:35.317 --> 01:48:37.218
- No?
- No.

2384
01:48:38.053 --> 01:48:39.621
So we're about to fire a dud?

2385
01:48:39.654 --> 01:48:41.122
- No.
- Explain.

2386
01:48:41.156 --> 01:48:43.925
Well, I can't. I
just... I-I just know.

2387
01:48:43.958 --> 01:48:45.627
I know the implosion
lenses will work.

2388
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:47.062
If we fire these detonators

2389
01:48:47.095 --> 01:48:48.339
and they don't
trigger a reaction,

2390
01:48:48.363 --> 01:48:50.031
two years' worth of plutonium

2391
01:48:50.065 --> 01:48:51.475
will be scattered
across White Sands.

2392
01:48:51.499 --> 01:48:55.403
A month of my salary against
ten bucks says it lights.

2393
01:48:55.437 --> 01:48:57.439
- Jesus.
- (thunder rumbling)

2394
01:48:57.472 --> 01:48:59.974
(tense music continues)

2395
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:05.647
WEATHERMAN: The wind's picking
up at zero, not the rain.

2396
01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.115
Lightning's circling.

2397
01:49:07.148 --> 01:49:08.592
You think it might be
time to tell your men

2398
01:49:08.616 --> 01:49:11.519
to get away from the steel
tower with the atomic bomb?

2399
01:49:11.553 --> 01:49:14.022
(laughter)

2400
01:49:14.656 --> 01:49:16.624
Let's get to South Observation.

2401
01:49:16.658 --> 01:49:18.126
Pull 'em out.

2402
01:49:18.159 --> 01:49:19.570
ROBERT: We can make our
determination there.

2403
01:49:19.594 --> 01:49:22.063
(tense music continues)

2404
01:49:24.966 --> 01:49:26.968
The team hasn't
slept in two nights.

2405
01:49:27.001 --> 01:49:29.003
If we stand down,
make the bomb safe,

2406
01:49:29.037 --> 01:49:30.372
we won't be back here for weeks.

2407
01:49:30.405 --> 01:49:32.073
Then we'll miss Potsdam.

2408
01:49:32.107 --> 01:49:34.008
I gotta get word
to Truman by 7:00.

2409
01:49:34.042 --> 01:49:35.276
Our window's closing.

2410
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:36.378
What is this doing?

2411
01:49:36.411 --> 01:49:37.912
Raining, blowing, lightning.

2412
01:49:37.946 --> 01:49:39.981
- For how long, damn it?
- It's holdin' strong.

2413
01:49:40.014 --> 01:49:41.316
It'll break before dawn.

2414
01:49:41.349 --> 01:49:43.027
- How could you know that?
- I know this desert.

2415
01:49:43.051 --> 01:49:44.152
Storm cools overnight.

2416
01:49:44.185 --> 01:49:45.987
Just before dawn,
the storm breaks.

2417
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:48.223
He could be right, but
schedule as late as possible.

2418
01:49:48.256 --> 01:49:49.991
5:30!

2419
01:49:50.024 --> 01:49:51.059
Sign your forecast.

2420
01:49:51.092 --> 01:49:52.169
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

2421
01:49:52.193 --> 01:49:53.995
Frank, tell them all, 5:30.

2422
01:49:54.028 --> 01:49:56.164
- 5:30, 5:30.
- MAN: 5:30.

2423
01:49:58.366 --> 01:50:03.304
Three years, 4,000
people, $2 billion.

2424
01:50:03.338 --> 01:50:05.707
Well, if it doesn't
go off... (sighs)

2425
01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.342
we're both finished.

2426
01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:10.078
(thunder rumbling)

2427
01:50:10.111 --> 01:50:12.080
I'm betting on three kilotons.

2428
01:50:13.047 --> 01:50:14.492
Anything less, they
won't get what it is.

2429
01:50:14.516 --> 01:50:19.087
What did Fermi mean by
"atmospheric ignition"?

2430
01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.598
Well, we had a moment
where it looked like

2431
01:50:20.622 --> 01:50:24.459
the chain reaction from an
atomic device might never stop.

2432
01:50:25.693 --> 01:50:27.729
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

2433
01:50:27.762 --> 01:50:29.731
Why is Fermi still
taking side bets on it?

2434
01:50:29.764 --> 01:50:32.934
Call it gallows humor.

2435
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:38.072
Wait, are we saying
there's a chance

2436
01:50:38.106 --> 01:50:39.974
that when we push that button,

2437
01:50:40.008 --> 01:50:41.342
we destroy the world?

2438
01:50:41.376 --> 01:50:43.545
Nothing in our research
over three years

2439
01:50:43.578 --> 01:50:45.213
supports that conclusion.

2440
01:50:45.246 --> 01:50:48.216
Except as the most
remote possibility.

2441
01:50:48.249 --> 01:50:49.584
How remote?

2442
01:50:49.617 --> 01:50:51.219
Chances are near zero.

2443
01:50:52.554 --> 01:50:53.955
Near zero?

2444
01:50:54.722 --> 01:50:57.292
What do you want
from theory alone?

2445
01:50:57.325 --> 01:50:58.760
(scoffs)

2446
01:50:58.793 --> 01:51:01.162
Zero would be nice.

2447
01:51:04.466 --> 01:51:06.100
In exactly

2448
01:51:06.134 --> 01:51:09.437
one hour, 58 minutes,

2449
01:51:09.471 --> 01:51:11.005
we'll know.

2450
01:51:17.045 --> 01:51:18.246
It's letting up.

2451
01:51:19.514 --> 01:51:21.983
(tense music continues)

2452
01:51:31.125 --> 01:51:33.495
The arming party's left Zero,
they're heading this way.

2453
01:51:33.528 --> 01:51:34.496
Throwing the switches.

2454
01:51:34.529 --> 01:51:35.630
Turn the cars.

2455
01:51:35.663 --> 01:51:38.132
Ready for emergency evacuation.

2456
01:51:42.103 --> 01:51:44.405
(tense music continues)

2457
01:51:55.818 --> 01:51:57.058
ARMY CAPTAIN: welder's glass.

2458
01:51:57.085 --> 01:51:58.653
Everybody take your places.

2459
01:51:58.686 --> 01:52:01.189
Everybody take a welder's glass.

2460
01:52:02.690 --> 01:52:04.559
Everybody take a welder's glass.

2461
01:52:24.145 --> 01:52:27.315
(tense music continues)

2462
01:52:54.208 --> 01:52:55.743
(timer ticking)

2463
01:52:55.777 --> 01:52:57.178
Twenty minutes.

2464
01:53:00.682 --> 01:53:02.517
Twenty minutes.

2465
01:53:13.695 --> 01:53:15.229
That's 20.

2466
01:53:18.232 --> 01:53:19.701
On the leg, please.

2467
01:53:21.235 --> 01:53:23.738
- Feynman.
- No.

2468
01:53:23.771 --> 01:53:25.740
The glass. Stops the U.V.

2469
01:53:25.773 --> 01:53:27.575
And what stops the glass?

2470
01:53:28.576 --> 01:53:31.546
I'm gonna head to base
camp. Best of luck.

2471
01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.215
Robert.

2472
01:53:34.817 --> 01:53:36.651
Try not to blow up the world.

2473
01:53:40.221 --> 01:53:42.423
(tense music building)

2474
01:53:48.529 --> 01:53:49.631
Watch that needle.

2475
01:53:49.664 --> 01:53:51.232
If the detonators don't charge

2476
01:53:51.265 --> 01:53:53.201
or the voltage drops
below one volt,

2477
01:53:53.234 --> 01:53:55.236
you hit that button, you abort.

2478
01:53:55.269 --> 01:53:57.572
- Understood?
- Understood.

2479
01:54:02.677 --> 01:54:04.245
(rocket hissing)

2480
01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:07.515
MAN (on speaker): Two
minutes to detonation.

2481
01:54:07.548 --> 01:54:09.517
Everybody down.

2482
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:10.518
Do not turn around

2483
01:54:10.551 --> 01:54:13.621
until you see light
reflected on the hills.

2484
01:54:13.655 --> 01:54:14.789
Then look at the explosion

2485
01:54:14.823 --> 01:54:16.457
only through your
welder's glass.

2486
01:54:16.491 --> 01:54:19.193
MAN (on speaker): Ninety
seconds to detonation.

2487
01:54:20.829 --> 01:54:23.665
Ninety seconds to detonation.

2488
01:54:23.698 --> 01:54:25.800
Is it rubbed in?

2489
01:54:25.834 --> 01:54:27.201
Yeah.

2490
01:54:33.541 --> 01:54:36.644
MAN (on speaker): Sixty
seconds to detonation.

2491
01:54:37.913 --> 01:54:40.682
(intense music playing)

2492
01:54:51.325 --> 01:54:53.561
These things are
hard on your heart.

2493
01:54:53.594 --> 01:54:55.296
MAN (on speaker):
Thirty seconds.

2494
01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:59.600
(charging up)

2495
01:55:00.401 --> 01:55:01.803
Detonators charged.

2496
01:55:03.005 --> 01:55:06.474
(intense music continues)

2497
01:55:11.947 --> 01:55:15.416
MAN (on speaker):
Seventeen, sixteen,

2498
01:55:15.450 --> 01:55:16.617
fifteen,

2499
01:55:16.651 --> 01:55:17.820
fourteen,

2500
01:55:17.853 --> 01:55:19.654
thirteen,

2501
01:55:19.687 --> 01:55:21.857
twelve,

2502
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:23.558
eleven,

2503
01:55:23.591 --> 01:55:25.560
ten,

2504
01:55:25.593 --> 01:55:27.996
nine,

2505
01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:29.998
eight,

2506
01:55:30.032 --> 01:55:32.600
seven,

2507
01:55:32.633 --> 01:55:35.003
- six...
- (intense music building)

2508
01:55:35.037 --> 01:55:36.504
five...

2509
01:55:38.506 --> 01:55:40.976
four...

2510
01:55:41.009 --> 01:55:42.945
three...

2511
01:55:42.978 --> 01:55:44.512
two...

2512
01:55:45.814 --> 01:55:46.882
- one.
- (music stops)

2513
01:55:46.915 --> 01:55:49.650
(silence)

2514
01:55:50.785 --> 01:55:53.287
(breathing heavily)

2515
01:56:00.561 --> 01:56:03.564
(both gasp)

2516
01:56:05.934 --> 01:56:08.369
(exhales)

2517
01:56:08.402 --> 01:56:10.338
(whispers): Poof.

2518
01:56:13.008 --> 01:56:14.810
(breathing heavily)

2519
01:56:28.456 --> 01:56:31.292
(faint pensive music playing)

2520
01:56:42.971 --> 01:56:44.705
(continues breathing heavily)

2521
01:56:54.448 --> 01:56:58.352
(breathing heavily)

2522
01:57:00.122 --> 01:57:02.790
(faint pensive music continues)

2523
01:57:19.141 --> 01:57:22.510
ROBERT: <i>"And now
I am become Death.</i>

2524
01:57:24.412 --> 01:57:26.581
<i>The destroyer of worlds."</i>

2525
01:57:29.184 --> 01:57:30.618
(explosion)

2526
01:57:30.651 --> 01:57:32.587
(rumbling)

2527
01:57:37.725 --> 01:57:39.427
(silence)

2528
01:57:41.096 --> 01:57:43.065
(explosion)

2529
01:57:43.098 --> 01:57:46.134
(rumbling)

2530
01:57:46.168 --> 01:57:47.602
(silence)

2531
01:57:48.904 --> 01:57:51.039
(distant explosion)

2532
01:57:51.073 --> 01:57:52.773
(distant rumbling)

2533
01:57:54.042 --> 01:57:55.509
(rumbling)

2534
01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:00.949
FRANK: It worked.

2535
01:58:03.584 --> 01:58:04.920
(rumbling subsides)

2536
01:58:08.156 --> 01:58:10.125
(muffled laughter)

2537
01:58:10.158 --> 01:58:12.793
(all cheering and applauding)

2538
01:58:23.238 --> 01:58:25.673
(mellow music playing)

2539
01:58:30.678 --> 01:58:32.713
- (playing triumphant beat)
- (all cheering)

2540
01:58:34.615 --> 01:58:36.151
(whooping excitedly)

2541
01:58:36.184 --> 01:58:38.186
- You owe me ten dollars!
- Oh!

2542
01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:40.488
(laughs)

2543
01:58:40.521 --> 01:58:41.656
- Come on!
- Hang on.

2544
01:58:41.689 --> 01:58:43.125
I'm good for it, Kisty.

2545
01:58:43.158 --> 01:58:45.459
- (both laughing)
- You are.

2546
01:58:45.493 --> 01:58:48.196
Yes, you are! (laughs)

2547
01:58:48.230 --> 01:58:50.933
(cheering and applauding)

2548
01:58:53.201 --> 01:58:55.569
(mellow music continues)

2549
01:59:12.287 --> 01:59:13.822
ROBERT: Well done.

2550
01:59:15.523 --> 01:59:18.060
We did it! We did it!

2551
01:59:18.093 --> 01:59:19.995
Well done.

2552
01:59:24.799 --> 01:59:26.634
- Get me Potsdam right away.
- Yes, sir.

2553
01:59:26.667 --> 01:59:28.870
(cheering continues)

2554
01:59:38.113 --> 01:59:39.881
Get a message to Kitty.

2555
01:59:39.915 --> 01:59:40.614
We can't say anything.

2556
01:59:40.648 --> 01:59:42.583
Tell her to take in the sheets.

2557
01:59:50.591 --> 01:59:52.127
We did it, everyone!

2558
01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:54.762
- (telephone ringing)
- (baby crying)

2559
01:59:56.999 --> 01:59:58.799
(shushes) Hello?

2560
01:59:58.834 --> 02:00:01.269
- CHARLOTTE: Hi, Kitty?
- What, what? Charlotte...

2561
02:00:01.303 --> 02:00:02.670
Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.

2562
02:00:02.703 --> 02:00:04.072
Oh, um, well, I don't know,

2563
02:00:04.106 --> 02:00:07.309
he just said to tell you
to "bring in the sheets."

2564
02:00:07.342 --> 02:00:09.978
(baby continues crying)

2565
02:00:10.012 --> 02:00:11.579
Kitty?

2566
02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:15.117
Kitty? Kitty, are
you still there?

2567
02:00:22.024 --> 02:00:24.159
ROBERT: <i>If they detonate
it too high in the air,</i>

2568
02:00:24.192 --> 02:00:25.559
the blast won't be as powerful.

2569
02:00:25.593 --> 02:00:27.628
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

2570
02:00:27.661 --> 02:00:29.697
we'll take it from here.

2571
02:00:31.066 --> 02:00:34.069
(disquieting music playing)

2572
02:00:39.941 --> 02:00:42.844
Did Truman brief
Stalin at Potsdam?

2573
02:00:42.878 --> 02:00:45.613
A brief would be
an overstatement.

2574
02:00:45.646 --> 02:00:49.717
He referred to a
powerful new weapon.

2575
02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:54.823
Stalin hoped we'd
use it against Japan.

2576
02:00:56.058 --> 02:00:57.792
That's it?

2577
02:00:57.826 --> 02:01:01.063
Robert, we've given them an ace,
it's for them to play the hand.

2578
02:01:03.198 --> 02:01:05.300
You're aiming for the 6th?

2579
02:01:05.333 --> 02:01:07.635
It's up to the CO
in the Pacific.

2580
02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:11.039
Shall I come with
you to Washington?

2581
02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.875
What for?

2582
02:01:16.144 --> 02:01:17.745
Well, you'll keep me informed.

2583
02:01:19.081 --> 02:01:20.714
Of course.

2584
02:01:22.284 --> 02:01:23.885
As best I can.

2585
02:01:23.919 --> 02:01:25.686
(engine revs)

2586
02:01:41.303 --> 02:01:44.172
Would the Japanese surrender
if they knew what was coming?

2587
02:01:45.407 --> 02:01:47.008
I don't know.

2588
02:01:49.411 --> 02:01:51.413
TELLER: Have you seen
Szilard's petition?

2589
02:01:51.446 --> 02:01:54.182
What the hell does Szilard
know about the Japanese?

2590
02:01:54.216 --> 02:01:55.426
You're not signing it, are you?

2591
02:01:55.450 --> 02:01:58.854
Many people have. A
lot of people have.

2592
02:01:58.887 --> 02:02:00.021
Edward.

2593
02:02:01.289 --> 02:02:02.958
The fact that we built this bomb

2594
02:02:02.991 --> 02:02:05.994
does not give us any more...
any more right or responsibility

2595
02:02:06.027 --> 02:02:08.130
to decide how it's
used than anyone else.

2596
02:02:08.163 --> 02:02:10.165
But we're the only
people who know about it.

2597
02:02:10.198 --> 02:02:13.767
I've told Stimson the various
opinions of the community.

2598
02:02:13.801 --> 02:02:15.203
But what's your opinion?

2599
02:02:16.438 --> 02:02:17.973
Once it's used...

2600
02:02:19.074 --> 02:02:22.776
nuclear war, perhaps all war...

2601
02:02:24.379 --> 02:02:25.814
becomes unthinkable.

2602
02:02:25.847 --> 02:02:28.850
Until somebody
builds a bigger bomb.

2603
02:02:49.437 --> 02:02:51.173
I thought they would call.

2604
02:02:51.206 --> 02:02:52.773
It's only the 5th.

2605
02:02:54.943 --> 02:02:56.945
In Japan, it's the 6th.

2606
02:03:10.091 --> 02:03:11.092
Charlotte.

2607
02:03:13.428 --> 02:03:15.130
Try Groves.

2608
02:03:16.131 --> 02:03:17.199
<i>Anything?</i>

2609
02:03:19.501 --> 02:03:20.869
Charlotte?

2610
02:03:20.902 --> 02:03:22.204
CHARLOTTE: Truman's
on the radio.

2611
02:03:23.138 --> 02:03:26.041
TRUMAN (on radio):
Sixteen hours ago,

2612
02:03:26.074 --> 02:03:31.980
an American airplane dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima...

2613
02:03:33.014 --> 02:03:36.151
and destroyed its
usefulness to the enemy.

2614
02:03:36.184 --> 02:03:38.086
(elated laughter outside)

2615
02:03:38.119 --> 02:03:43.992
The bomb had more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

2616
02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:47.929
It is an atomic bomb.

2617
02:03:47.963 --> 02:03:51.099
- (excited chatter)
- (car horns honking)

2618
02:03:51.132 --> 02:03:52.500
It is a harnessing

2619
02:03:52.534 --> 02:03:55.303
of the basic powers
of the universe.

2620
02:03:57.339 --> 02:03:58.974
CHARLOTTE: <i>Groves on one.</i>

2621
02:03:59.007 --> 02:04:02.043
TRUMAN: We are now prepared
to destroy more rapidly

2622
02:04:02.077 --> 02:04:04.379
and completely the Japanese...

2623
02:04:04.412 --> 02:04:06.081
ROBERT: (clears
throat) General?

2624
02:04:06.114 --> 02:04:09.150
GROVES: I'm very proud of
you and all of your people.

2625
02:04:09.184 --> 02:04:10.518
It went all right?

2626
02:04:10.552 --> 02:04:13.521
Apparently, it went
with a tremendous bang.

2627
02:04:13.555 --> 02:04:15.190
ROBERT: Well,

2628
02:04:15.223 --> 02:04:18.159
everyone here is feeling
reasonably good about it.

2629
02:04:19.594 --> 02:04:21.229
It's been a long road.

2630
02:04:21.263 --> 02:04:24.065
GROVES: I think one of the
wisest things I ever did

2631
02:04:24.099 --> 02:04:27.135
was when I selected the
director of Los Alamos.

2632
02:04:27.168 --> 02:04:29.471
- (cheering)
- (car horns honking)

2633
02:04:29.504 --> 02:04:31.840
TRUMAN: <i>We have spent</i>

2634
02:04:31.873 --> 02:04:33.875
<i>more than $2 billion</i>

2635
02:04:33.908 --> 02:04:38.146
<i>on the greatest scientific
gamble in history,</i>

2636
02:04:38.179 --> 02:04:41.016
<i>and we have won.</i>

2637
02:04:41.049 --> 02:04:43.818
(cheering)

2638
02:04:44.552 --> 02:04:47.255
CROWD (chanting):
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2639
02:04:47.289 --> 02:04:49.291
Oppie! Oppie!

2640
02:04:49.324 --> 02:04:52.527
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2641
02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.396
Oppie! Oppie!

2642
02:04:54.429 --> 02:04:57.198
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2643
02:04:57.232 --> 02:05:00.568
- Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
- (applause)

2644
02:05:00.602 --> 02:05:05.206
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2645
02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.574
Oppie! Oppie!

2646
02:05:06.608 --> 02:05:09.177
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2647
02:05:09.210 --> 02:05:12.080
(rhythmic stomping)

2648
02:05:12.947 --> 02:05:15.950
(stomping intensifying)

2649
02:05:29.164 --> 02:05:32.000
- (stomping subsides)
- (cheering continues)

2650
02:06:05.934 --> 02:06:08.236
(breathing heavily)

2651
02:06:08.269 --> 02:06:09.371
The world...

2652
02:06:11.373 --> 02:06:12.507
will remember this day.

2653
02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:14.909
(cheering and applauding)

2654
02:06:23.551 --> 02:06:26.221
(muffled distant rumbling)

2655
02:06:31.426 --> 02:06:33.161
It's too soon to...

2656
02:06:34.028 --> 02:06:35.697
It's too soon to determine

2657
02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:38.099
what the results
of the bombing are.

2658
02:06:41.035 --> 02:06:42.637
But I'll bet the
Japanese didn't like it.

2659
02:06:42.670 --> 02:06:45.206
(cheering and applauding)

2660
02:06:51.446 --> 02:06:53.057
- (woman screams)
- (cheering sound muted)

2661
02:06:53.081 --> 02:06:54.616
(distant rumbling continues)

2662
02:06:54.649 --> 02:06:57.285
(Robert breathing heavily)

2663
02:07:03.525 --> 02:07:05.059
I'm so proud.

2664
02:07:06.194 --> 02:07:08.329
So proud of what you
have accomplished.

2665
02:07:09.697 --> 02:07:11.966
(continues breathing heavily)

2666
02:07:14.636 --> 02:07:18.473
I just wish we had it in time
to use against the Germans.

2667
02:07:24.012 --> 02:07:26.414
(continues breathing heavily)

2668
02:07:26.448 --> 02:07:28.516
(wind howling)

2669
02:07:41.095 --> 02:07:42.330
(jarring musical sting)

2670
02:07:42.363 --> 02:07:45.200
- (cheering sound returns)
- (hearty laughter)

2671
02:07:56.411 --> 02:07:58.279
(somber music playing)

2672
02:08:06.654 --> 02:08:09.023
(sobbing)

2673
02:08:28.811 --> 02:08:31.814
(man weeping)

2674
02:08:31.847 --> 02:08:34.082
(laughter)

2675
02:08:34.749 --> 02:08:37.285
(somber music continues)

2676
02:09:00.208 --> 02:09:02.310
(somber music fading out)

2677
02:09:08.316 --> 02:09:10.184
WOMAN: Dr. Oppenheimer?

2678
02:09:10.785 --> 02:09:13.087
Dr. Oppenheimer? (chuckles)

2679
02:09:13.121 --> 02:09:14.789
- Nice picture.
- Oh.

2680
02:09:14.823 --> 02:09:17.158
President Truman
will see you now.

2681
02:09:19.862 --> 02:09:21.496
(clears throat)

2682
02:09:30.873 --> 02:09:33.708
Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

2683
02:09:33.741 --> 02:09:35.677
- Mr. President.
- TRUMAN: Please.

2684
02:09:35.710 --> 02:09:37.512
Thank you.

2685
02:09:37.545 --> 02:09:39.080
Secretary Byrnes.

2686
02:09:40.281 --> 02:09:42.283
How's it feel to be

2687
02:09:42.317 --> 02:09:44.352
the most famous
man in the world?

2688
02:09:45.353 --> 02:09:48.423
You helped save a lot
of American lives.

2689
02:09:48.456 --> 02:09:50.826
What we did at
Hiroshima was a...

2690
02:09:50.859 --> 02:09:52.794
And Nagasaki.

2691
02:09:52.828 --> 02:09:54.830
Well, obviously.

2692
02:09:54.863 --> 02:09:58.800
Your invention let us
bring our boys home.

2693
02:09:58.834 --> 02:10:02.203
Well, it was hardly
my invention.

2694
02:10:02.236 --> 02:10:04.505
It was you on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

2695
02:10:04.539 --> 02:10:07.342
(both chuckling)

2696
02:10:07.375 --> 02:10:08.911
Jim tells me you're concerned

2697
02:10:08.944 --> 02:10:10.712
about an arms race
with the Soviets.

2698
02:10:10.745 --> 02:10:13.114
Uh, yes, uh...

2699
02:10:13.816 --> 02:10:15.316
Well, um,

2700
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:20.455
it's that, uh, now is
our chance to secure

2701
02:10:20.488 --> 02:10:23.358
international cooperation on
(clears throat) atomic energy,

2702
02:10:23.391 --> 02:10:26.427
and... and I'm concerned...

2703
02:10:26.461 --> 02:10:28.696
Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

2704
02:10:28.730 --> 02:10:30.665
I don't think I could give a...

2705
02:10:30.698 --> 02:10:32.101
Never.

2706
02:10:32.734 --> 02:10:34.369
Never.

2707
02:10:34.402 --> 02:10:37.572
Mr. President, the-the
Russians have good physicists

2708
02:10:37.605 --> 02:10:39.240
and-and... and
abundant resources.

2709
02:10:39.273 --> 02:10:41.376
- Abundant? (laughs)
- Yes.

2710
02:10:41.409 --> 02:10:44.679
- I don't think so.
- (chuckles)

2711
02:10:44.712 --> 02:10:48.249
Well, they'll-they'll put
everything they have and...

2712
02:10:51.519 --> 02:10:55.390
I hear you're
leaving Los Alamos.

2713
02:10:56.658 --> 02:10:57.759
What should we do with it?

2714
02:10:57.792 --> 02:11:00.294
Give it back to the Indians.

2715
02:11:07.702 --> 02:11:10.939
Um... Dr. Oppenheimer, (sighs)

2716
02:11:10.973 --> 02:11:13.307
if what you say about
the Soviets is true,

2717
02:11:13.341 --> 02:11:16.744
we have to build up Los Alamos,

2718
02:11:16.778 --> 02:11:18.680
not shut it down.

2719
02:11:21.917 --> 02:11:23.718
Uh, Mr. President...

2720
02:11:24.786 --> 02:11:26.287
Um...

2721
02:11:28.957 --> 02:11:32.627
I feel that I have
blood on my hands.

2722
02:11:33.728 --> 02:11:36.731
(disquieting music playing)

2723
02:11:52.413 --> 02:11:57.719
You think anyone in
Hiroshima or Nagasaki

2724
02:11:57.752 --> 02:12:00.788
gives a shit who built the bomb?

2725
02:12:03.959 --> 02:12:06.327
They care who dropped it.

2726
02:12:07.029 --> 02:12:09.297
I did.

2727
02:12:10.531 --> 02:12:13.501
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2728
02:12:16.504 --> 02:12:17.840
(sniffs)

2729
02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:21.776
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2730
02:12:25.047 --> 02:12:26.514
(Truman clears throat)

2731
02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.523
TRUMAN: Don't let that
crybaby back in here.

2732
02:12:40.628 --> 02:12:43.664
STRAUSS: <i>Robert saw that
hand-wringing got him nowhere.</i>

2733
02:12:43.698 --> 02:12:47.035
<i>By the time I'd met
him, he'd fully embraced</i>

2734
02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:49.637
<i>his "father of the
bomb" reputation.</i>

2735
02:12:49.670 --> 02:12:52.074
Used his profile to
influence policy.

2736
02:12:52.107 --> 02:12:54.642
(clamoring)

2737
02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:02.927
ROBB: <i>Doctor, in the
years following the war,</i>

2738
02:13:02.951 --> 02:13:05.087
would you say that you
exerted a great influence

2739
02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.922
on the atomic
policies of the USA?

2740
02:13:06.955 --> 02:13:09.657
ROBERT: <i>I think great
would be an overstatement.</i>

2741
02:13:09.690 --> 02:13:11.659
ROBB: Really? If we look
at the issue of isotopes,

2742
02:13:11.692 --> 02:13:13.394
were you not
personally responsible

2743
02:13:13.427 --> 02:13:15.463
for destroying all
opposition to their export?

2744
02:13:15.496 --> 02:13:18.366
- Could use a-a bottle of beer...
- (laughter)

2745
02:13:18.399 --> 02:13:20.078
when making atomic
weapons. In fact, you do.

2746
02:13:20.102 --> 02:13:22.570
I was the spokesman,
but the-the opinion

2747
02:13:22.603 --> 02:13:24.405
among scientists was unanimous.

2748
02:13:24.438 --> 02:13:26.108
All along with
McCarthy on the rise,

2749
02:13:26.141 --> 02:13:27.542
he knew he was vulnerable.

2750
02:13:27.575 --> 02:13:28.944
His brother was blacklisted

2751
02:13:28.977 --> 02:13:31.880
by every university
in the country.

2752
02:13:32.981 --> 02:13:35.818
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

2753
02:13:38.419 --> 02:13:39.855
And Chevalier went into exile.

2754
02:13:42.991 --> 02:13:44.425
But none of that

2755
02:13:44.458 --> 02:13:46.427
stopped Robert from
pushing the GAC

2756
02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:49.330
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

2757
02:13:51.133 --> 02:13:52.600
He was devastated

2758
02:13:52.633 --> 02:13:54.702
when Truman rejected
their recommendation.

2759
02:13:56.437 --> 02:13:58.974
I miss Richard more
than I can bear.

2760
02:13:59.007 --> 02:14:00.775
I know, Ruth, I know.

2761
02:14:00.809 --> 02:14:03.912
Part of me's glad he didn't live
to see where this is all going.

2762
02:14:06.681 --> 02:14:08.116
ROBERT: Here comes
the birthday boy.

2763
02:14:08.150 --> 02:14:10.751
- To gloat.
- RUTH: Have fun.

2764
02:14:11.752 --> 02:14:14.122
Robert, uh, my son and his
fiancée are desperate to meet

2765
02:14:14.156 --> 02:14:16.124
the father of the
atomic bomb, and so...

2766
02:14:16.158 --> 02:14:18.961
Well. Good day.

2767
02:14:25.033 --> 02:14:27.135
Is this a bad time?

2768
02:14:27.169 --> 02:14:28.669
What do you think, Lewis?

2769
02:14:28.703 --> 02:14:30.771
Well, I think it must
have been a blow for you.

2770
02:14:30.805 --> 02:14:32.941
For the world.

2771
02:14:32.975 --> 02:14:34.609
The world?

2772
02:14:34.642 --> 02:14:38.613
What does Fuchs mean to
the rest of the world?

2773
02:14:38.646 --> 02:14:40.048
Fuchs?

2774
02:14:40.082 --> 02:14:41.682
Klaus Fuchs?

2775
02:14:43.118 --> 02:14:45.519
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

2776
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:48.656
(sighs)

2777
02:14:48.689 --> 02:14:50.558
Klaus Fuchs, the British
scientist that you put

2778
02:14:50.591 --> 02:14:53.628
onto the implosion
team at Los Alamos,

2779
02:14:53.661 --> 02:14:55.796
<i>turns out he was...</i>

2780
02:14:55.831 --> 02:14:59.101
he was spying for the
Soviets the whole time.

2781
02:14:59.134 --> 02:15:00.668
I'm sorry.

2782
02:15:03.671 --> 02:15:05.806
(brooding music playing)

2783
02:15:05.841 --> 02:15:08.743
<i>After the truth
about Fuchs came out,</i>

2784
02:15:08.776 --> 02:15:10.879
the FBI stepped up
surveillance on him.

2785
02:15:10.913 --> 02:15:14.782
He knew his phone was tapped,
he was followed everywhere...

2786
02:15:16.151 --> 02:15:17.585
his trash picked through.

2787
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:23.058
But never stopped
speaking his mind.

2788
02:15:23.091 --> 02:15:25.760
A man of conviction.

2789
02:15:25.793 --> 02:15:28.629
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

2790
02:15:30.132 --> 02:15:33.567
When Eisenhower took office,
he saw one more chance.

2791
02:15:34.970 --> 02:15:36.004
He took it.

2792
02:15:36.038 --> 02:15:38.506
America and Russia

2793
02:15:38.539 --> 02:15:42.811
may be likened to two
scorpions in a bottle,

2794
02:15:42.844 --> 02:15:46.214
each capable of
killing the other

2795
02:15:46.248 --> 02:15:48.951
but only at the risk
of his own life.

2796
02:15:48.984 --> 02:15:51.752
Now, there are various
aspects of this policy...

2797
02:15:51.786 --> 02:15:53.788
STRAUSS: <i>Lot of
scientists blame me,</i>

2798
02:15:53.822 --> 02:15:56.959
<i>but how was I supposed
to protect him?</i>

2799
02:15:56.992 --> 02:15:58.961
Too secret for discussion,

2800
02:15:58.994 --> 02:16:00.996
candor is the only remedy.

2801
02:16:01.029 --> 02:16:02.563
Officials in Washington

2802
02:16:02.596 --> 02:16:04.108
need to start leveling
with the American people.

2803
02:16:04.132 --> 02:16:05.766
(people murmuring)

2804
02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:08.636
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

2805
02:16:08.669 --> 02:16:10.705
So he had to lose his
security clearance.

2806
02:16:10.738 --> 02:16:13.507
- And with it, his credibility.
- (knocking)

2807
02:16:13.541 --> 02:16:15.944
But how could they do it?

2808
02:16:15.978 --> 02:16:17.245
He was a war hero.

2809
02:16:17.279 --> 02:16:18.981
He'd already told
everyone about his past.

2810
02:16:19.014 --> 02:16:20.983
Borden dredged it all up.

2811
02:16:21.016 --> 02:16:24.252
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2812
02:16:24.286 --> 02:16:25.854
Could it have been Nichols?

2813
02:16:25.887 --> 02:16:28.190
No, I can't imagine
he'd do that.

2814
02:16:28.223 --> 02:16:30.258
But whoever did
unleashed a firestorm

2815
02:16:30.292 --> 02:16:32.294
that burned a path
from the White House

2816
02:16:32.327 --> 02:16:34.997
back to my desk at the AEC.

2817
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:36.865
You see them in there, right?

2818
02:16:36.898 --> 02:16:40.768
I've been working my
whole life to get here.

2819
02:16:40.801 --> 02:16:42.838
Cabinet of the United
States of America.

2820
02:16:42.871 --> 02:16:44.805
Now, in front of
the entire country,

2821
02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:46.908
they're gonna put
me back in my place.

2822
02:16:48.343 --> 02:16:51.013
A lowly shoe salesman.

2823
02:16:51.046 --> 02:16:52.881
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2824
02:16:52.914 --> 02:16:54.983
I-I think we can get
the Senate to grasp

2825
02:16:55.017 --> 02:16:57.819
that you did your duty,
painful though it was.

2826
02:16:57.853 --> 02:16:59.620
Now, will Hill's
testimony back us up?

2827
02:16:59.653 --> 02:17:01.631
- COUNSEL: Hill will be fine.
- I don't really know him,

2828
02:17:01.655 --> 02:17:03.825
but, uh, he was one of
Szilard's boys in Chicago,

2829
02:17:03.859 --> 02:17:05.894
and they never forgave
Robert for not supporting

2830
02:17:05.927 --> 02:17:08.330
their petition
against bombing Japan.

2831
02:17:08.363 --> 02:17:13.567
This was taken 31 days
after the bombing.

2832
02:17:13.601 --> 02:17:16.338
Virtually everyone
in the street,

2833
02:17:16.371 --> 02:17:18.606
for nearly a mile around,

2834
02:17:18.639 --> 02:17:21.843
was instantly and
seriously burned.

2835
02:17:21.877 --> 02:17:23.045
(people gasping)

2836
02:17:23.078 --> 02:17:27.615
The, uh, Japanese spoke of
people who wore striped clothing

2837
02:17:27.648 --> 02:17:30.618
upon whom the skin
was burned in stripes.

2838
02:17:31.685 --> 02:17:34.056
There were many who
thought themselves lucky,

2839
02:17:34.089 --> 02:17:36.791
who climbed out of the
ruins of their homes

2840
02:17:36.825 --> 02:17:38.692
only slightly injured.

2841
02:17:39.828 --> 02:17:41.595
But they died anyway.

2842
02:17:42.264 --> 02:17:45.367
They died days or weeks later

2843
02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.736
from the radium-like rays
emitted in great numbers

2844
02:17:48.769 --> 02:17:50.671
at the moment of the explosion.

2845
02:17:51.873 --> 02:17:53.942
Did you read this
crap in the papers?

2846
02:17:53.975 --> 02:17:56.777
A British physicist is
saying the atomic bombings

2847
02:17:56.812 --> 02:17:58.980
were not the last
act of World War II

2848
02:17:59.014 --> 02:18:02.150
but the first act of this
cold war with Russia.

2849
02:18:02.184 --> 02:18:03.651
Which physicist?

2850
02:18:03.684 --> 02:18:05.087
I think you knew him.

2851
02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:06.720
Patrick Blackett.

2852
02:18:07.956 --> 02:18:09.157
(scoffs)

2853
02:18:09.191 --> 02:18:10.758
ROBERT: He may not be wrong.

2854
02:18:10.791 --> 02:18:12.127
Stimson is now telling me

2855
02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:15.397
we bombed an enemy that
was essentially defeated.

2856
02:18:15.430 --> 02:18:18.967
TELLER: Robert, you've
all the influence now.

2857
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.701
Please.

2858
02:18:20.734 --> 02:18:22.838
Urge them to continue my
research on the Super.

2859
02:18:22.871 --> 02:18:24.239
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2860
02:18:24.272 --> 02:18:26.374
Why not?

2861
02:18:26.408 --> 02:18:28.110
It's not the right
use of our resources.

2862
02:18:28.143 --> 02:18:30.245
Is that what you really believe?

2863
02:18:30.278 --> 02:18:32.646
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2864
02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:35.083
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

2865
02:18:36.384 --> 02:18:38.153
Nobody knows what you believe.

2866
02:18:39.254 --> 02:18:41.123
Do you? Hmm?

2867
02:18:41.156 --> 02:18:43.859
GROVES: <i>One final time,
our program director,</i>

2868
02:18:43.892 --> 02:18:45.861
<i>Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.</i>

2869
02:18:45.894 --> 02:18:47.028
(applause)

2870
02:18:47.062 --> 02:18:48.830
ROBERT: <i>I hope that
in years to come</i>

2871
02:18:48.864 --> 02:18:52.868
you will look back on
your work here with pride.

2872
02:18:52.901 --> 02:18:55.270
But today, that pride
must be tempered

2873
02:18:55.303 --> 02:18:57.638
with a profound concern.

2874
02:18:58.907 --> 02:19:00.708
If atomic weapons
are to be added

2875
02:19:00.741 --> 02:19:03.145
to the arsenals of
a warring world,

2876
02:19:03.178 --> 02:19:06.747
then the day will come
when people will curse

2877
02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:08.183
the name of Los Alamos.

2878
02:19:12.187 --> 02:19:14.289
Uh, sorry, Admiral.

2879
02:19:14.322 --> 02:19:16.324
Stopped off to get this.

2880
02:19:16.358 --> 02:19:19.161
It seems pretty favorable.

2881
02:19:19.194 --> 02:19:20.304
COUNSEL: There's Oppenheimer.

2882
02:19:20.328 --> 02:19:21.897
What's the caption?

2883
02:19:21.930 --> 02:19:24.765
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought..."

2884
02:19:24.798 --> 02:19:26.301
(soft music plays)

2885
02:19:26.334 --> 02:19:27.903
"and the US won."

2886
02:19:28.736 --> 02:19:30.005
That'll work.

2887
02:19:30.038 --> 02:19:32.274
Those were your words
from the other day.

2888
02:19:32.307 --> 02:19:33.707
We needed to pivot.

2889
02:19:33.741 --> 02:19:35.010
But how would you know

2890
02:19:35.043 --> 02:19:36.845
what <i>Time</i> magazine's
gonna write?

2891
02:19:36.878 --> 02:19:39.114
Henry Luce is a friend.

2892
02:19:45.253 --> 02:19:48.756
You sat here and let me
tell you how it's done,

2893
02:19:48.789 --> 02:19:51.459
but you've been far
ahead all along.

2894
02:19:51.493 --> 02:19:54.462
Survival in Washington

2895
02:19:54.496 --> 02:19:56.831
is about knowing how
to get things done.

2896
02:19:57.465 --> 02:19:58.867
SENATE AIDE: Right.

2897
02:20:00.468 --> 02:20:02.204
What was it you
said about Borden?

2898
02:20:02.237 --> 02:20:05.240
"Why get caught holding
the knife yourself?"

2899
02:20:05.273 --> 02:20:07.042
(sighs)

2900
02:20:07.075 --> 02:20:10.078
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

2901
02:20:12.147 --> 02:20:14.382
It's gonna come down
to how much influence

2902
02:20:14.416 --> 02:20:16.484
Borden's been able
to exert on Teller.

2903
02:20:16.518 --> 02:20:18.954
- (Kitty laughing)
- Did I say something funny?

2904
02:20:18.987 --> 02:20:20.355
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"

2905
02:20:20.388 --> 02:20:24.159
when we all know
that it's Strauss.

2906
02:20:24.192 --> 02:20:26.161
Lewis brought me to
Princeton, Kitty.

2907
02:20:26.194 --> 02:20:28.897
And then you humiliated
him in front of Congress.

2908
02:20:28.930 --> 02:20:31.765
But more useful than a sandwich.

2909
02:20:31.799 --> 02:20:33.935
(laughter)

2910
02:20:34.936 --> 02:20:36.113
- How'd I do?
- MAN: I'll call recess,

2911
02:20:36.137 --> 02:20:37.239
ten minutes.

2912
02:20:37.272 --> 02:20:39.507
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2913
02:20:39.541 --> 02:20:40.774
That was six years ago.

2914
02:20:40.809 --> 02:20:42.510
You know, the truly vindictive,

2915
02:20:42.544 --> 02:20:44.145
patient as saints.

2916
02:20:44.179 --> 02:20:46.982
Strauss has been perfectly
clear that he is neutral.

2917
02:20:47.015 --> 02:20:50.518
- (glass shatters)
- Wake up. It is Strauss.

2918
02:20:50.552 --> 02:20:53.488
It's always been
Strauss, and you know it.

2919
02:20:53.521 --> 02:20:55.156
Why won't you fight him?

2920
02:20:56.191 --> 02:20:57.392
Christ's sake.

2921
02:20:57.425 --> 02:20:58.460
(door slams)

2922
02:20:58.493 --> 02:21:01.162
It wasn't Nichols or Hoover

2923
02:21:01.196 --> 02:21:02.864
or one of Truman's
guys. It was you.

2924
02:21:02.897 --> 02:21:04.866
You gave the file to Borden.

2925
02:21:04.899 --> 02:21:06.534
You set him on Oppenheimer.

2926
02:21:06.568 --> 02:21:09.004
- You convinced him to...
- (loudly): Borden...

2927
02:21:09.037 --> 02:21:10.939
(in normal tone): didn't
take any convincing.

2928
02:21:10.972 --> 02:21:13.074
NICHOLS: Take your time,
use the entire file.

2929
02:21:13.108 --> 02:21:16.011
Write up your conclusion,
send them to the FBI.

2930
02:21:16.044 --> 02:21:18.280
The material is
obviously extensive,

2931
02:21:18.313 --> 02:21:20.982
but there's nothing new here.

2932
02:21:21.016 --> 02:21:22.550
STRAUSS: Your
conclusions will be.

2933
02:21:22.584 --> 02:21:24.886
And they'll have to be answered.

2934
02:21:24.919 --> 02:21:26.388
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2935
02:21:26.421 --> 02:21:30.025
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

2936
02:21:30.058 --> 02:21:32.927
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

2937
02:21:32.961 --> 02:21:34.562
while you do this with the AEC.

2938
02:21:34.596 --> 02:21:36.431
- A trial.
- No.

2939
02:21:36.464 --> 02:21:40.235
No trial. You can't give
Oppenheimer a platform.

2940
02:21:40.268 --> 02:21:42.037
You can't martyr him.

2941
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:45.240
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

2942
02:21:45.273 --> 02:21:48.843
so he can never again speak on
matters of national security.

2943
02:21:48.877 --> 02:21:50.945
Then what?

2944
02:21:52.147 --> 02:21:55.517
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

2945
02:21:55.550 --> 02:21:57.319
(speaking indistinctly)

2946
02:22:01.956 --> 02:22:03.234
STRAUSS: <i>A simple
bureaucratic procedure.</i>

2947
02:22:03.258 --> 02:22:05.894
His Q clearance
is up for renewal.

2948
02:22:05.927 --> 02:22:08.897
You send your
accusations to the FBI.

2949
02:22:10.532 --> 02:22:14.135
Hoover sends them to the
AEC, you're forced to act.

2950
02:22:14.969 --> 02:22:16.271
You write up an indictment

2951
02:22:16.304 --> 02:22:17.939
<i>and tell Oppenheimer</i>

2952
02:22:17.972 --> 02:22:20.642
<i>his security clearance
is not being renewed.</i>

2953
02:22:20.675 --> 02:22:22.210
<i>But offer him the
chance to appeal.</i>

2954
02:22:22.243 --> 02:22:24.579
As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

2955
02:22:24.612 --> 02:22:26.114
ROBERT: May I keep this?

2956
02:22:26.147 --> 02:22:27.082
No.

2957
02:22:27.115 --> 02:22:29.351
If you do decide to appeal,

2958
02:22:29.384 --> 02:22:30.919
they'll have to send you a copy.

2959
02:22:30.952 --> 02:22:34.189
When he appeals... and
trust me, he will...

2960
02:22:34.222 --> 02:22:36.624
- I appoint a board.
- (indistinct conversation)

2961
02:22:36.658 --> 02:22:39.127
They will, of
course, have counsel.

2962
02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:41.096
- NICHOLS: Prosecutor?
- In all but name.

2963
02:22:41.129 --> 02:22:43.298
- NICHOLS: Who?
- Roger Robb.

2964
02:22:43.331 --> 02:22:44.499
Ouch.

2965
02:22:44.532 --> 02:22:46.000
Robb will have
security clearance

2966
02:22:46.034 --> 02:22:47.569
<i>to examine Oppenheimer's file.</i>

2967
02:22:47.602 --> 02:22:49.037
<i>As will the Gray board.</i>

2968
02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:50.438
Defense counsel will not.

2969
02:22:52.273 --> 02:22:53.675
A closed hearing.

2970
02:22:53.708 --> 02:22:54.952
ROBERT: <i>The so-called
derogatory information</i>

2971
02:22:54.976 --> 02:22:57.145
in your indictment of me.

2972
02:22:57.178 --> 02:22:59.647
No audience. No reporters.

2973
02:22:59.681 --> 02:23:03.151
- No burden of proof.
- No burden of proof?

2974
02:23:04.519 --> 02:23:06.020
We're not convicting.

2975
02:23:06.721 --> 02:23:09.324
We're just denying.

2976
02:23:14.295 --> 02:23:17.065
What is it you said?

2977
02:23:17.098 --> 02:23:20.435
"This is just how
the game is played."

2978
02:23:20.468 --> 02:23:23.438
Well, forgive my naivete.

2979
02:23:23.471 --> 02:23:25.440
Amateurs seek the sun.

2980
02:23:26.408 --> 02:23:27.475
Get eaten.

2981
02:23:28.543 --> 02:23:31.379
Power stays in the shadows.

2982
02:23:31.413 --> 02:23:35.116
But, sir, you're... you're
out of the shadows now.

2983
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:36.584
Yeah, that's why
this has to work.

2984
02:23:36.618 --> 02:23:38.086
Well...

2985
02:23:39.387 --> 02:23:41.523
Teller's testifying
this morning.

2986
02:23:41.556 --> 02:23:43.958
That'll help. And then...

2987
02:23:43.992 --> 02:23:45.427
Hill is in the afternoon.

2988
02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:47.929
Hill is gonna help us too.

2989
02:23:50.165 --> 02:23:53.334
STRAUSS: As you can see,
Robert, it's not yet signed.

2990
02:23:53.368 --> 02:23:54.402
May I keep this?

2991
02:23:54.436 --> 02:23:55.470
NICHOLS: No.

2992
02:23:57.572 --> 02:23:59.574
If you do decide to appeal,

2993
02:23:59.607 --> 02:24:02.444
then they'll have
to send you a copy.

2994
02:24:02.477 --> 02:24:04.979
(unsettling music playing)

2995
02:24:06.014 --> 02:24:08.316
Take my car and
driver. I insist.

2996
02:24:13.054 --> 02:24:14.989
I'll have to consult
my lawyers, Lewis.

2997
02:24:15.023 --> 02:24:17.725
Of course. But
don't take too long.

2998
02:24:17.759 --> 02:24:19.961
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2999
02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:28.403
I'm sorry it's come
to this, Robert.

3000
02:24:28.436 --> 02:24:29.471
I think it's wrong.

3001
02:24:29.504 --> 02:24:31.539
(unsettling music building)

3002
02:24:42.784 --> 02:24:44.219
ROBERT: <i>Nichols
wants me to fight</i>

3003
02:24:44.252 --> 02:24:46.254
<i>so he can get it
all on the record.</i>

3004
02:24:46.287 --> 02:24:48.156
Strauss wants me to walk away.

3005
02:24:48.189 --> 02:24:51.025
Strauss knows that
you can't do that,

3006
02:24:51.059 --> 02:24:53.495
you'd be accepting the charges.

3007
02:24:53.528 --> 02:24:55.196
You'll lose your job.

3008
02:24:55.230 --> 02:24:57.499
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

3009
02:24:57.532 --> 02:25:00.235
Robert, we have to fight.

3010
02:25:01.069 --> 02:25:02.770
(smacks lips)

3011
02:25:02.804 --> 02:25:05.106
VOLPE: As AEC Counsel,
I can't represent you.

3012
02:25:05.139 --> 02:25:06.674
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

3013
02:25:06.708 --> 02:25:08.243
Oh, he's good.

3014
02:25:08.276 --> 02:25:12.013
The best, but I
have to warn you...

3015
02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:15.116
this won't be a fair fight.

3016
02:25:15.149 --> 02:25:17.161
- (suspenseful music plays)
- ROBB: <i>During your interview</i>

3017
02:25:17.185 --> 02:25:19.654
with Boris Pash in 1943,
did you refer to microfilm?

3018
02:25:19.687 --> 02:25:21.189
- No.
- Tab 11,

3019
02:25:21.222 --> 02:25:22.666
page one, paragraph
three. You never said,

3020
02:25:22.690 --> 02:25:26.327
"Man at the consulate expert
in the use of microfilm"?

3021
02:25:26.361 --> 02:25:27.695
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No.

3022
02:25:27.729 --> 02:25:28.663
I would like to
know what document

3023
02:25:28.696 --> 02:25:30.131
Mr. Robb is quoting from

3024
02:25:30.164 --> 02:25:31.442
and if we might be
furnished with a copy.

3025
02:25:31.466 --> 02:25:33.535
The document is
classified, Mr. Garrison.

3026
02:25:33.568 --> 02:25:35.412
I think we should get back
to first-hand information.

3027
02:25:35.436 --> 02:25:36.804
This is first-hand.

3028
02:25:36.839 --> 02:25:39.107
How so, Roger?

3029
02:25:40.475 --> 02:25:42.310
There was a recording
of the interview.

3030
02:25:46.281 --> 02:25:48.182
GARRISON: You let
my client sit here

3031
02:25:48.216 --> 02:25:49.717
and potentially perjure himself,

3032
02:25:49.751 --> 02:25:52.287
and all this time,
you had a recording?

3033
02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:53.688
Nobody told your client

3034
02:25:53.721 --> 02:25:55.123
to misrepresent
his former answers.

3035
02:25:55.156 --> 02:25:57.225
Misrepre... It-it
was 12 years ago.

3036
02:25:57.258 --> 02:25:58.560
Can we hear this recording?

3037
02:25:58.593 --> 02:26:00.170
You don't have the
clearance, Mr. Garrison.

3038
02:26:00.194 --> 02:26:01.830
But you're reading
it into the record.

3039
02:26:01.864 --> 02:26:03.498
Please, please.

3040
02:26:03.531 --> 02:26:07.135
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

3041
02:26:07.168 --> 02:26:09.604
If it's truth, where's
the disclosure?

3042
02:26:09.637 --> 02:26:11.272
Where's the witness list?

3043
02:26:11.306 --> 02:26:13.842
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a
trial, as you are well aware.

3044
02:26:13.876 --> 02:26:15.743
Evidentiary rules do not apply.

3045
02:26:15.777 --> 02:26:17.645
We are dealing with
national security.

3046
02:26:17.679 --> 02:26:19.180
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

3047
02:26:19.213 --> 02:26:21.583
I fail to see how
national security

3048
02:26:21.616 --> 02:26:23.318
prevents the prosecution
from providing us

3049
02:26:23.351 --> 02:26:25.362
- with a list of witnesses.
- Perhaps we are in need

3050
02:26:25.386 --> 02:26:26.697
- of a brief recess.
- ROBERT: Gentlemen,

3051
02:26:26.721 --> 02:26:28.456
you have my words.

3052
02:26:28.489 --> 02:26:30.634
If you say they're from a
transcript, then I'll accept it.

3053
02:26:30.658 --> 02:26:33.428
I've already explained I made
up a cock-and-bull story.

3054
02:26:33.461 --> 02:26:36.798
But why would anyone make
up such an elaborate story?

3055
02:26:36.832 --> 02:26:38.901
Because I was an idiot.

3056
02:26:38.934 --> 02:26:40.535
Why lie?

3057
02:26:40.568 --> 02:26:43.171
Well, clearly with the
intention of not revealing

3058
02:26:43.204 --> 02:26:45.273
who the intermediary was.

3059
02:26:45.306 --> 02:26:47.342
Your friend, Haakon
Chevalier, the Communist.

3060
02:26:47.375 --> 02:26:49.644
Is he still your friend?

3061
02:26:49.677 --> 02:26:51.112
Yes.

3062
02:26:53.214 --> 02:26:56.150
GARRISON: Dr. Rabi,
thank you for coming.

3063
02:26:56.184 --> 02:26:57.896
Do you know who else the
prosecution has called?

3064
02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:00.254
Teller, obviously.

3065
02:27:01.222 --> 02:27:02.490
They've asked Lawrence.

3066
02:27:02.523 --> 02:27:03.358
What did he say?

3067
02:27:03.391 --> 02:27:06.294
He wasn't going to
help them, but...

3068
02:27:06.327 --> 02:27:07.261
But?

3069
02:27:07.295 --> 02:27:09.297
Strauss told him that
you and Ruth Tolman

3070
02:27:09.330 --> 02:27:11.766
<i>have been having an
affair for years.</i>

3071
02:27:11.799 --> 02:27:12.901
<i>The whole time you lived</i>

3072
02:27:12.935 --> 02:27:14.569
- with them in Pasadena.
- (sighs)

3073
02:27:14.602 --> 02:27:16.270
He convinced Lawrence

3074
02:27:16.304 --> 02:27:17.873
that Richard died
of a broken heart.

3075
02:27:17.906 --> 02:27:19.207
That's absurd.

3076
02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:21.776
- What part?
- The broken heart.

3077
02:27:21.810 --> 02:27:23.846
Richard never found out.

3078
02:27:23.879 --> 02:27:25.647
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

3079
02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:27.181
I don't know.

3080
02:27:27.715 --> 02:27:29.350
GARRISON: Dr. Rabi,

3081
02:27:29.384 --> 02:27:32.453
what governmental positions
do you currently hold?

3082
02:27:32.487 --> 02:27:35.390
I am the chairman of the
General Advisory Committee

3083
02:27:35.423 --> 02:27:38.326
to the AEC, succeeding
Dr. Oppenheimer.

3084
02:27:38.359 --> 02:27:41.195
GARRISON: And how long have
you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

3085
02:27:41.229 --> 02:27:42.831
Since 1928.

3086
02:27:42.865 --> 02:27:44.933
I... I know him quite well.

3087
02:27:44.967 --> 02:27:46.935
Well enough to
speak to the bearing

3088
02:27:46.969 --> 02:27:49.537
of his loyalty and character?

3089
02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:53.574
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

3090
02:27:53.608 --> 02:27:56.277
And he is loyal to
the United States,

3091
02:27:56.310 --> 02:27:57.545
to his friends,

3092
02:27:57.578 --> 02:28:00.248
to the institutions
of which he is part.

3093
02:28:01.716 --> 02:28:02.750
Eat.

3094
02:28:05.653 --> 02:28:06.688
(scoffs)

3095
02:28:07.856 --> 02:28:10.458
(suspenseful music continues)

3096
02:28:21.736 --> 02:28:23.438
- ROBERT: What was that?
- (door closes)

3097
02:28:23.471 --> 02:28:25.506
RABI: Nothing to worry about.

3098
02:28:27.742 --> 02:28:29.477
ROBB: <i>After the
Russian A-bomb test,</i>

3099
02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:31.980
did Dr. Lawrence come to see
you about the hydrogen bomb?

3100
02:28:32.014 --> 02:28:33.816
You'd be better off asking him.

3101
02:28:33.849 --> 02:28:35.383
Well, I fully intend to.

3102
02:28:35.416 --> 02:28:37.986
Would you say that
Dr. Oppenheimer was

3103
02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:40.022
unalterably opposed
to the H-bomb?

3104
02:28:40.055 --> 02:28:42.858
No, he-he thought
that a fusion program

3105
02:28:42.891 --> 02:28:45.994
would come at the expense of our
awfully good fission program.

3106
02:28:46.028 --> 02:28:47.863
But that proved
not to be the case.

3107
02:28:47.896 --> 02:28:50.531
In the event both could be done.

3108
02:28:50.565 --> 02:28:52.868
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied

3109
02:28:52.901 --> 02:28:54.036
that in his testimony here,

3110
02:28:54.069 --> 02:28:56.337
Dr. Oppenheimer had
been wholly truthful.

3111
02:28:56.370 --> 02:28:59.574
What would you say whether
or not he should be cleared?

3112
02:28:59.607 --> 02:29:01.509
Why go through all
this against a man

3113
02:29:01.542 --> 02:29:03.745
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

3114
02:29:03.778 --> 02:29:05.413
Look at his record.

3115
02:29:05.446 --> 02:29:07.515
We have an A-bomb and
a whole series of it.

3116
02:29:07.548 --> 02:29:09.484
We have a whole
series of Super bombs.

3117
02:29:09.517 --> 02:29:11.486
What more do you want?

3118
02:29:11.519 --> 02:29:12.386
Mermaids?

3119
02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:14.722
TELLER: But I've known
Secretary Strauss

3120
02:29:14.756 --> 02:29:16.357
for many years,

3121
02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:19.660
and I feel it a necessity
to express the warm support

3122
02:29:19.694 --> 02:29:22.363
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

3123
02:29:22.396 --> 02:29:23.631
We'll break now,

3124
02:29:23.664 --> 02:29:25.466
unless there's any
immediate business.

3125
02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:28.036
STRAUSS: Senator, I'd
like to once again request

3126
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:30.738
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

3127
02:29:30.772 --> 02:29:33.541
And I will remind the
nominee that we don't always

3128
02:29:33.574 --> 02:29:35.576
have that information
in advance.

3129
02:29:35.610 --> 02:29:39.047
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

3130
02:29:39.081 --> 02:29:40.715
Mr. Chairman, our next
scheduled witness,

3131
02:29:40.748 --> 02:29:45.286
Dr. Lawrence, has apparently
come down with colitis.

3132
02:29:46.754 --> 02:29:49.657
So we'll proceed with
William Borden instead.

3133
02:29:50.926 --> 02:29:52.326
Mr. Borden, welcome.

3134
02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:53.829
Please take a seat.

3135
02:29:54.997 --> 02:29:57.398
Mr. Borden,

3136
02:29:57.431 --> 02:30:00.002
during your investigation
into Dr. Oppenheimer,

3137
02:30:00.035 --> 02:30:01.669
did you reach
certain conclusions?

3138
02:30:01.702 --> 02:30:04.006
- I did.
- And did there come a time

3139
02:30:04.039 --> 02:30:05.506
when you expressed
those conclusions

3140
02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:07.542
in a letter to
Mr. J. Edgar Hoover

3141
02:30:07.575 --> 02:30:09.510
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation?

3142
02:30:09.544 --> 02:30:10.955
- BORDEN: That is correct.
- Prior to the writing

3143
02:30:10.979 --> 02:30:12.756
of the letter, did you discuss
the writing of the letter

3144
02:30:12.780 --> 02:30:15.083
with anybody attached to the
Atomic Energy Commission?

3145
02:30:15.117 --> 02:30:16.717
I did not.

3146
02:30:16.751 --> 02:30:18.096
ROBB: Thanks, and do you
have a copy of the letter?

3147
02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:19.720
BORDEN: I have one
in front of me.

3148
02:30:19.754 --> 02:30:21.857
Would you please be so
kind as to read it, sir?

3149
02:30:21.890 --> 02:30:23.424
BORDEN: "Dear Mr. Hoover,

3150
02:30:23.457 --> 02:30:24.903
the purpose of this
letter is to state..."

3151
02:30:24.927 --> 02:30:26.971
GARRISON: Uh, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, if I could have a...

3152
02:30:26.995 --> 02:30:29.363
What is the purpose
of the delay?

3153
02:30:29.397 --> 02:30:30.866
He's simply gonna
read the letter.

3154
02:30:30.899 --> 02:30:32.433
(scoffs) Mr. Chairman,

3155
02:30:32.466 --> 02:30:34.468
this is the first I've
seen of this letter,

3156
02:30:34.502 --> 02:30:35.770
and I see statements here, uh,

3157
02:30:35.803 --> 02:30:37.772
at least one, of a
kind that I don't think

3158
02:30:37.805 --> 02:30:39.774
anyone would like to
see go into the record.

3159
02:30:39.807 --> 02:30:42.577
These are accusations that
have not previously been made.

3160
02:30:42.610 --> 02:30:44.545
That are not part of the
indictment from Nichols.

3161
02:30:44.579 --> 02:30:46.714
Accusations of a kind that
I don't think belong here.

3162
02:30:46.747 --> 02:30:48.917
The witness wrote this
letter on his own initiative,

3163
02:30:48.951 --> 02:30:51.519
laying out evidence that has
already been before the board.

3164
02:30:51.552 --> 02:30:53.155
His conclusions are
valid testimony,

3165
02:30:53.188 --> 02:30:55.090
just like the... the
positive conclusions

3166
02:30:55.123 --> 02:30:56.457
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

3167
02:30:56.490 --> 02:30:57.993
It cuts both ways.

3168
02:30:58.026 --> 02:31:00.461
How long has Counsel been in
possession of this letter?

3169
02:31:00.494 --> 02:31:01.864
I don't think I
should be subject

3170
02:31:01.897 --> 02:31:04.465
to cross-examination
by you, Mr. Garrison.

3171
02:31:04.498 --> 02:31:06.144
GRAY: Mr. Garrison, given
that we on the board

3172
02:31:06.168 --> 02:31:07.668
have all read the letter,

3173
02:31:07.702 --> 02:31:10.038
wouldn't it be better to
have it in the record?

3174
02:31:10.072 --> 02:31:11.539
Let's proceed.

3175
02:31:11.572 --> 02:31:13.507
(tense music playing)

3176
02:31:13.541 --> 02:31:15.010
BORDEN: "Dear Mr. Hoover,

3177
02:31:15.043 --> 02:31:18.479
"the purpose of this letter
is to state my opinion

3178
02:31:18.512 --> 02:31:19.815
"based upon years of study

3179
02:31:19.848 --> 02:31:22.617

"J. Robert Oppenheimer is an
agent of the Soviet Union.

"J. Robert Oppenheimer

3185
02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:40.501
"was a sufficiently
hardened Communist,

"that he volunteered

"he has since acted
under a Soviet directive

02:31:54.782 --> 02:31:57.518
in influencing United
States military policy..."

3192
02:31:57.551 --> 02:31:58.786
I'm sorry, Robert.

3193
02:31:58.820 --> 02:32:00.164
BORDEN: "atomic
energy, intelligence

3194
02:32:00.188 --> 02:32:01.565
- and diplomatic policy."
- Is anyone

3195
02:32:01.589 --> 02:32:03.225
ever going to tell the truth

3196
02:32:03.258 --> 02:32:05.027
about what's happening here?

3197
02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:08.596
CHAIRMAN MAGNUSON: <i>We will
now hear from Dr. David Hill.</i>

3198
02:32:08.629 --> 02:32:11.033
(soft suspenseful music plays)

3199
02:32:17.839 --> 02:32:19.174
Dr. Hill,

3200
02:32:19.207 --> 02:32:21.843
would you care to
make a statement?

3201
02:32:22.978 --> 02:32:24.545
Thank you.

3202
02:32:24.578 --> 02:32:28.250
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

3203
02:32:28.283 --> 02:32:30.685
A man who has given
years of service

3204
02:32:30.718 --> 02:32:33.688
in high positions of government

3205
02:32:33.721 --> 02:32:38.659
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

3206
02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:41.172
The views I have to
express are my own,

3207
02:32:41.196 --> 02:32:44.900
but I believe that much I have
to say will help to indicate

3208
02:32:44.933 --> 02:32:48.636
why most of the
scientists in this country

3209
02:32:48.669 --> 02:32:51.672
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss

3210
02:32:51.706 --> 02:32:53.541
completely out of government.

3211
02:32:53.574 --> 02:32:55.543
(murmurs of surprise)

3212
02:32:55.576 --> 02:32:58.080
You're... You're
referring to the hostility

3213
02:32:58.113 --> 02:32:59.580
of certain scientists

3214
02:32:59.613 --> 02:33:01.249
directed toward Mr. Strauss

3215
02:33:01.283 --> 02:33:03.517
because of his
commitment to security

3216
02:33:03.551 --> 02:33:06.554
as demonstrated in the
Oppenheimer affair?

3217
02:33:09.024 --> 02:33:10.292
No.

3218
02:33:10.325 --> 02:33:12.727
Because of the
personal vindictiveness

3219
02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:14.997
he demonstrated against
Dr. Oppenheimer.

3220
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:16.630
(people exclaiming)

3221
02:33:16.664 --> 02:33:18.799
- MAGNUSON: Order.
- (gavel banging)

3222
02:33:18.834 --> 02:33:19.868
Order!

3223
02:33:19.901 --> 02:33:25.173
It appears to most scientists
around this country

3224
02:33:25.207 --> 02:33:26.741
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being

3225
02:33:26.774 --> 02:33:29.011
pilloried and put
through an ordeal

3226
02:33:29.044 --> 02:33:32.147
because he expressed
his honest opinions.

3227
02:33:33.148 --> 02:33:35.217
Dr. Bush, I thought I
was performing a service

3228
02:33:35.250 --> 02:33:36.985
to my country when
hearing this case.

3229
02:33:37.019 --> 02:33:41.156
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

3230
02:33:41.189 --> 02:33:43.825
because he expressed
strong opinions.

3231
02:33:43.859 --> 02:33:46.928
If you want to try that
case, you should try me.

3232
02:33:46.962 --> 02:33:50.966
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if I become stirred,

3233
02:33:50.999 --> 02:33:52.200
but I am.

3234
02:33:52.234 --> 02:33:54.202
Dr. Hill, we've already heard

3235
02:33:54.236 --> 02:33:56.670
that Mr. Strauss did
not bring the charges

3236
02:33:56.704 --> 02:33:59.774
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

3237
02:33:59.807 --> 02:34:02.310
The Oppenheimer matter was

3238
02:34:02.344 --> 02:34:04.712
initiated and carried through

3239
02:34:04.745 --> 02:34:07.115
largely through the
animus of Lewis Strauss.

3240
02:34:07.149 --> 02:34:08.682
(people exclaim)

3241
02:34:08.716 --> 02:34:11.353
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

3242
02:34:11.386 --> 02:34:12.988
on the shipment of
isotopes to Norway,

3243
02:34:13.021 --> 02:34:17.025
and Strauss never forgave
him this public humiliation.

3244
02:34:17.059 --> 02:34:19.660
Another controversy between
them centered around

3245
02:34:19.693 --> 02:34:22.663
their differences in
judgment on how the H-bomb

3246
02:34:22.696 --> 02:34:24.765
<i>would contribute to
national security.</i>

3247
02:34:24.799 --> 02:34:26.767
Strauss turned to the
personnel security system

3248
02:34:26.801 --> 02:34:31.039
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness,

3249
02:34:31.073 --> 02:34:33.607
and Strauss was able to
find a few ambitious men

3250
02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:36.677
who also disagreed with
Oppenheimer's positions

3251
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:39.747
and envied him his prestige
in government circles.

3252
02:34:39.780 --> 02:34:42.384
TELLER: I've always
assumed, and still assume,

3253
02:34:42.417 --> 02:34:44.652
that he's loyal to
the United States.

3254
02:34:44.685 --> 02:34:46.097
I believe this. And
I shall believe it

3255
02:34:46.121 --> 02:34:48.689
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

3256
02:34:48.722 --> 02:34:50.691
Do you or do you not believe

3257
02:34:50.724 --> 02:34:53.028
that Dr. Oppenheimer
is a security risk?

3258
02:34:54.029 --> 02:34:55.130
(smacks lips)

3259
02:34:56.764 --> 02:34:58.033
In a great number of cases,

3260
02:34:58.066 --> 02:35:00.035
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way

3261
02:35:00.068 --> 02:35:03.939
which was to me exceedingly
hard to understand.

3262
02:35:03.972 --> 02:35:05.974
I thoroughly disagreed with
him in numerous issues,

3263
02:35:06.007 --> 02:35:08.110
and his actions
frankly appeared to me

3264
02:35:08.143 --> 02:35:09.677
confused and complicated.

3265
02:35:09.710 --> 02:35:11.246
To this extent, I feel,

3266
02:35:11.279 --> 02:35:14.382
I want to see the vital
interest of this country

3267
02:35:14.416 --> 02:35:16.251
in hands which I
understand better

3268
02:35:16.284 --> 02:35:18.420
and therefore trust more.

3269
02:35:18.453 --> 02:35:21.223
- MORGAN: Thank you, Doctor.
- ROBB: Thank you.

3270
02:35:25.026 --> 02:35:26.128
I'm sorry.

3271
02:35:28.762 --> 02:35:30.932
KITTY: <i>You shook
his fucking hand?</i>

3272
02:35:30.966 --> 02:35:33.869
Oh, I would have
spit in his face.

3273
02:35:33.902 --> 02:35:35.446
Not sure the board would
have appreciated that.

3274
02:35:35.470 --> 02:35:37.048
KITTY: Is it not
gentlemanly enough for you?

3275
02:35:37.072 --> 02:35:40.408
Well, I-I think you're all
being too goddamn gentlemanly.

3276
02:35:40.442 --> 02:35:42.410
Gray must see what
Robb is doing.

3277
02:35:42.444 --> 02:35:44.379
Why doesn't he
just shut him down?

3278
02:35:44.412 --> 02:35:47.015
And you shaking Teller's hand.

3279
02:35:47.048 --> 02:35:49.918
You need to stop
playing the martyr.

3280
02:35:50.919 --> 02:35:53.321
Under the current
AEC guidelines,

3281
02:35:53.355 --> 02:35:55.756
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

3282
02:35:55.789 --> 02:35:58.093
(unnerving music playing)

3283
02:36:01.930 --> 02:36:04.299
Under my interpretation (sighs)

3284
02:36:04.332 --> 02:36:06.468
of the Atomic Energy Act,

3285
02:36:06.501 --> 02:36:08.336
which did not exist

3286
02:36:08.370 --> 02:36:11.206
when I hired
Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942...

3287
02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:15.844
I would not clear him today,

3288
02:36:15.877 --> 02:36:17.846
uh, if I were on the commission.

3289
02:36:17.879 --> 02:36:19.457
ROBB: Good. Thank you,
General. That is all.

3290
02:36:19.481 --> 02:36:21.483
But I don't think I'd
clear any of those guys.

3291
02:36:21.516 --> 02:36:23.684
That's all.

3292
02:36:26.188 --> 02:36:28.323
GARRISON: Dr. Oppenheimer
had no responsibility

3293
02:36:28.356 --> 02:36:29.858
in the selection
or the clearance

3294
02:36:29.891 --> 02:36:31.193
of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

3295
02:36:31.226 --> 02:36:32.494
No. None at all.

3296
02:36:32.527 --> 02:36:34.129
And you wouldn't want
to leave this board

3297
02:36:34.162 --> 02:36:36.932
with any suggestion today
that you're here questioning

3298
02:36:36.965 --> 02:36:39.000
his basic loyalty
to the United States

3299
02:36:39.034 --> 02:36:40.435
in the operation of Los Alamos?

3300
02:36:40.468 --> 02:36:42.037
By no means.

3301
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:44.072
I hope I didn't lead
anyone to believe otherwise

3302
02:36:44.105 --> 02:36:45.739
for an instant.

3303
02:36:45.773 --> 02:36:46.875
GRAY: Thank you, General.

3304
02:36:46.908 --> 02:36:49.945
(wistful music playing)

3305
02:37:04.926 --> 02:37:07.195
Okay. We shouldn't
keep them waiting.

3306
02:37:07.229 --> 02:37:08.496
She'll be here.

3307
02:37:08.530 --> 02:37:09.965
Do you even want her here?

3308
02:37:09.998 --> 02:37:12.500
Only a fool or an adolescent

3309
02:37:12.534 --> 02:37:14.436
presumes to know someone
else's relationship,

3310
02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:16.770
and you're neither, Lloyd.

3311
02:37:16.804 --> 02:37:18.306
(door shuts)

3312
02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:20.308
Kitty and I,

3313
02:37:20.342 --> 02:37:22.410
we're grown-ups.

3314
02:37:22.444 --> 02:37:25.280
<i>We've walked through
fire together.</i>

3315
02:37:25.313 --> 02:37:27.882
She'll do fine.

3316
02:37:27.916 --> 02:37:29.985
GARRISON: Would you describe
your views on Communism

3317
02:37:30.018 --> 02:37:32.053
as pro, anti, neutral?

3318
02:37:32.087 --> 02:37:33.955
KITTY: Very strongly against.

3319
02:37:33.989 --> 02:37:36.124
I-I've had nothing to do
with Communism in... since...

3320
02:37:36.157 --> 02:37:38.994
since 1936, since...

3321
02:37:39.027 --> 02:37:41.896
since before I met Robert.

3322
02:37:42.497 --> 02:37:44.332
That's all.

3323
02:37:44.366 --> 02:37:45.934
HILL: <i>The record demonstrates</i>

3324
02:37:45.967 --> 02:37:47.569
<i>that Oppenheimer
was not interrogated</i>

3325
02:37:47.602 --> 02:37:50.839
<i>by impartial and disinterested
counsel for the Gray board.</i>

3326
02:37:50.872 --> 02:37:52.274
<i>He was interrogated
by a prosecutor</i>

3327
02:37:52.307 --> 02:37:53.975
<i>who used all the tricks</i>

3328
02:37:54.009 --> 02:37:55.810
<i>of a rather ingenious
legal background.</i>

3329
02:37:55.844 --> 02:37:57.279
SENATOR SCOTT: You
are charging now

3330
02:37:57.312 --> 02:38:00.282
that the Gray board
permitted a prosecution.

3331
02:38:00.315 --> 02:38:03.018
If I were on the Gray board,

3332
02:38:03.051 --> 02:38:05.020
I would have protested
against the tactics

3333
02:38:05.053 --> 02:38:07.956
of the man who served, in fact,
as the prosecuting counsel.

3334
02:38:07.989 --> 02:38:11.192
A man appointed not by the board

3335
02:38:11.226 --> 02:38:13.295
but by Lewis Strauss.

3336
02:38:13.328 --> 02:38:15.263
(people exclaim)

3337
02:38:15.297 --> 02:38:16.331
Who was this?

3338
02:38:17.632 --> 02:38:19.467
I'm sorry?

3339
02:38:19.501 --> 02:38:20.568
Who was this?

3340
02:38:20.602 --> 02:38:22.037
Uh, Roger Robb.

3341
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:24.406
- (chair scrapes)
- Mrs. Oppenheimer.

3342
02:38:26.341 --> 02:38:28.576
(pensive music playing)

3343
02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:31.046
Did you have a Communist
Party membership card?

3344
02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:34.582
I'm... I'm not sure.

3345
02:38:34.616 --> 02:38:36.117
ROBB: Not sure?

3346
02:38:39.087 --> 02:38:40.088
Well...

3347
02:38:42.490 --> 02:38:44.225
- (sighs)
- ROBB: Well?

3348
02:38:53.168 --> 02:38:56.137
I mean, presumably, the
act of joining the Party

3349
02:38:56.171 --> 02:38:59.941
required sending some money
and receiving a card, no?

3350
02:39:03.111 --> 02:39:04.245
Yeah.

3351
02:39:07.315 --> 02:39:09.017
(sighs)

3352
02:39:09.617 --> 02:39:11.019
(softly): Sorry.

3353
02:39:11.653 --> 02:39:13.254
ROBB: Yes. Mm.

3354
02:39:15.090 --> 02:39:17.092
It's just it was all
so very long ago,

3355
02:39:17.125 --> 02:39:18.960
- Mr. Robb, wasn't it?
- Not really.

3356
02:39:18.993 --> 02:39:20.228
Long enough to have forgotten.

3357
02:39:20.261 --> 02:39:21.639
Did you return the
card or rip it up?

3358
02:39:21.663 --> 02:39:23.264
The card whose existence
I've forgotten?

3359
02:39:23.298 --> 02:39:25.100
Your Communist Party
membership card.

3360
02:39:25.133 --> 02:39:26.868
Haven't the slightest idea.

3361
02:39:29.170 --> 02:39:31.940
Can a distinction
be made between

3362
02:39:31.973 --> 02:39:33.641
Soviet Communism and Communism?

3363
02:39:33.675 --> 02:39:35.243
Well, in the days
when I was a member,

3364
02:39:35.276 --> 02:39:36.916
I thought they were
definitely two things.

3365
02:39:36.945 --> 02:39:38.213
- Oh?
- I thought that

3366
02:39:38.246 --> 02:39:40.115
the Communist Party
of the United States

3367
02:39:40.148 --> 02:39:42.550
was concerned with
our domestic problems.

3368
02:39:42.584 --> 02:39:44.052
I now no longer believe this.

3369
02:39:44.085 --> 02:39:45.129
Believe the whole
thing's linked together

3370
02:39:45.153 --> 02:39:46.421
and spread all over the world,

3371
02:39:46.454 --> 02:39:48.656
and I have believed this
since I left the Party

3372
02:39:48.690 --> 02:39:50.158
16 years ago.

3373
02:39:50.191 --> 02:39:51.493
- But...
- Seventeen years ago.

3374
02:39:51.526 --> 02:39:52.927
My mistake.

3375
02:39:52.961 --> 02:39:55.597
- But you said...
- Sorry, 18.

3376
02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:57.899
Eighteen years ago.

3377
02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:00.010
ROBB: Are you
familiar with the fact

3378
02:40:00.034 --> 02:40:01.212
your husband was
making contributions

3379
02:40:01.236 --> 02:40:04.305
to the Spanish Civil
War as late as 1942?

3380
02:40:04.339 --> 02:40:06.217
I knew that Robert gave
money from time to time.

3381
02:40:06.241 --> 02:40:07.485
Did you know this
money was going

3382
02:40:07.509 --> 02:40:08.943
into Communist Party channels?

3383
02:40:08.977 --> 02:40:10.412
Don't you mean "through"?

3384
02:40:10.445 --> 02:40:12.213
- Pardon?
- I think you mean

3385
02:40:12.247 --> 02:40:14.048
"through Communist Party
channels," don't you?

3386
02:40:14.082 --> 02:40:15.316
- Y-Yes!
- Yes?

3387
02:40:15.350 --> 02:40:17.252
- Yes!
- KITTY: Yes.

3388
02:40:17.285 --> 02:40:20.989
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

3389
02:40:21.022 --> 02:40:22.323
your husband had not stopped

3390
02:40:22.357 --> 02:40:24.292
having anything to do
with the Communist Party?

3391
02:40:24.325 --> 02:40:26.127
You don't have to
answer that yes or no.

3392
02:40:26.161 --> 02:40:27.538
You can answer that
any way you wish.

3393
02:40:27.562 --> 02:40:29.431
I know that, thank you.

3394
02:40:29.464 --> 02:40:31.166
It's your question.

3395
02:40:31.199 --> 02:40:33.101
- It's not properly phrased.
- Do you understand

3396
02:40:33.134 --> 02:40:34.369
- what I'm getting at?
- I do.

3397
02:40:34.402 --> 02:40:35.679
Then why don't you
answer it that way?

3398
02:40:35.703 --> 02:40:37.305
'Cause I don't like your phrase.

3399
02:40:37.338 --> 02:40:39.274
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

3400
02:40:39.307 --> 02:40:41.109
Because Robert never
had anything to do

3401
02:40:41.142 --> 02:40:42.444
with the Communist
Party as such.

3402
02:40:42.477 --> 02:40:45.113
I know he gave money
to Spanish refugees.

3403
02:40:45.146 --> 02:40:47.081
I know he took an
intellectual interest

3404
02:40:47.115 --> 02:40:48.316
in Communist ideas...

3405
02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:49.460
Are there two types
of Communists?

3406
02:40:49.484 --> 02:40:51.186
Intellectual Communists

3407
02:40:51.219 --> 02:40:53.154
and your plain old
regular Commie?

3408
02:40:53.188 --> 02:40:54.122
(laughs)

3409
02:40:54.155 --> 02:40:55.723
Well, I couldn't
answer that one.

3410
02:40:55.757 --> 02:40:58.526
EVANS: (laughs) I
couldn't either.

3411
02:41:04.666 --> 02:41:06.468
GARRISON: Evening.

3412
02:41:06.501 --> 02:41:08.236
VOLPE: Robert, you
can't win this thing.

3413
02:41:08.269 --> 02:41:10.214
It's a kangaroo court with
a predetermined outcome.

3414
02:41:10.238 --> 02:41:12.173
Why put yourself
through more of it?

3415
02:41:12.774 --> 02:41:15.210
I have my reasons.

3416
02:41:15.811 --> 02:41:17.245
All right.

3417
02:41:17.278 --> 02:41:18.413
Good night.

3418
02:41:23.117 --> 02:41:24.519
He has a point.

3419
02:41:25.453 --> 02:41:27.489
I'm not sure you
understand, Albert.

3420
02:41:27.522 --> 02:41:28.623
EINSTEIN: No?

3421
02:41:28.656 --> 02:41:32.160
I left my country
never to return.

3422
02:41:32.794 --> 02:41:34.762
You served your country well.

3423
02:41:34.796 --> 02:41:38.433
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

3424
02:41:38.466 --> 02:41:42.103
perhaps you should
turn your back on her.

3425
02:41:42.136 --> 02:41:44.772
Damn it, I happen to
love this country.

3426
02:41:44.806 --> 02:41:47.408
Then tell them to go to hell.

3427
02:41:47.442 --> 02:41:48.343
Interestingly enough,

3428
02:41:48.376 --> 02:41:51.446
this is no longer a
confirmation hearing,

3429
02:41:51.479 --> 02:41:53.648
it's now a trial...

3430
02:41:53.681 --> 02:41:55.416
about a trial!

3431
02:41:56.417 --> 02:41:57.728
It's not good he's
telling everyone

3432
02:41:57.752 --> 02:41:59.053
you initiated the hearings.

3433
02:41:59.087 --> 02:42:01.456
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

3434
02:42:01.489 --> 02:42:04.158
He certainly can't prove that
I gave the file to Borden.

3435
02:42:04.192 --> 02:42:06.528
We're not in court, sir.

3436
02:42:06.561 --> 02:42:07.762
There's no burden of proof.

3437
02:42:07.795 --> 02:42:10.164
Right. They're not convicting...

3438
02:42:10.198 --> 02:42:11.466
(sighs) just denying.

3439
02:42:11.499 --> 02:42:14.402
Why would Hill come
here to tear me down?

3440
02:42:14.435 --> 02:42:16.070
What's his angle?

3441
02:42:16.104 --> 02:42:18.206
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

3442
02:42:18.239 --> 02:42:19.842
- As he sees it.
- I told you,

3443
02:42:19.875 --> 02:42:22.544
Oppenheimer poisoned the
scientists against me,

3444
02:42:22.577 --> 02:42:24.279
right from that first meeting.

3445
02:42:24.312 --> 02:42:27.549
<i>I don't know what Oppenheimer
said to him that day,</i>

3446
02:42:27.582 --> 02:42:30.318
but Einstein wouldn't
even meet my eye.

3447
02:42:30.351 --> 02:42:31.386
(inaudible)

3448
02:42:31.419 --> 02:42:34.522
<i>Oppenheimer knows how
to manipulate his own.</i>

3449
02:42:34.556 --> 02:42:35.824
And at Los Alamos,

3450
02:42:35.858 --> 02:42:38.192
he preyed on the
naivete of scientists

3451
02:42:38.226 --> 02:42:40.528
who thought they'd get a say
in how we used their work,

3452
02:42:40.562 --> 02:42:43.565
but don't ever think he
was that naive himself.

3453
02:42:43.598 --> 02:42:44.867
ROBB: Doctor.

3454
02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:46.869
During your work on
the hydrogen bomb,

3455
02:42:46.902 --> 02:42:50.572
were you deterred
by any moral qualms?

3456
02:42:50.605 --> 02:42:52.240
Yes, of course.

3457
02:42:52.273 --> 02:42:53.584
ROBB: But you still got on
with your work, didn't you?

3458
02:42:53.608 --> 02:42:55.844
Yes, because this was
work of exploration,

3459
02:42:55.878 --> 02:42:58.112
it was not the
preparation of a weapon.

3460
02:42:58.146 --> 02:43:00.214
You mean it was more of
a... an academic excursion.

3461
02:43:00.248 --> 02:43:02.150
No, it is not an academic thing

3462
02:43:02.183 --> 02:43:03.594
whether you can build
a hydrogen bomb.

3463
02:43:03.618 --> 02:43:05.219
It's a matter of life and death.

3464
02:43:05.253 --> 02:43:06.621
By 1942, you were
actively pushing

3465
02:43:06.654 --> 02:43:08.232
the development of the
hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

3466
02:43:08.256 --> 02:43:09.490
Pushing's not the right word.

3467
02:43:09.524 --> 02:43:11.459
Supporting it and
working on it, yes.

3468
02:43:11.492 --> 02:43:13.829
So when did these moral
qualms become so strong

3469
02:43:13.862 --> 02:43:15.496
that you actively opposed

3470
02:43:15.530 --> 02:43:17.198
the development of
the hydrogen bomb?

3471
02:43:17.231 --> 02:43:19.200
When it was suggested
that it be the policy

3472
02:43:19.233 --> 02:43:21.402
of the United States to make
these things at all cost

3473
02:43:21.436 --> 02:43:23.438
without regard to the
balance between these weapons

3474
02:43:23.471 --> 02:43:26.541
and atomic weapons as
part of our arsenal.

3475
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:29.845
What do moral qualms
have to do with that?

3476
02:43:29.878 --> 02:43:31.914
Wha... What do moral qualms

3477
02:43:31.947 --> 02:43:33.481
- have to do with it?
- ROBB: Yes.

3478
02:43:33.514 --> 02:43:35.583
Oppenheimer wanted to
own the atomic bomb.

3479
02:43:35.617 --> 02:43:37.518
He wanted to be the man
who moved the Earth.

3480
02:43:37.552 --> 02:43:40.722
He talks about putting
the nuclear genie

3481
02:43:40.755 --> 02:43:42.223
back in the bottle.

3482
02:43:42.256 --> 02:43:43.391
Well, I'm here to tell you

3483
02:43:43.424 --> 02:43:45.627
that I know J.
Robert Oppenheimer,

3484
02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:49.764
and if he could do it all
over, he'd do it all the same.

3485
02:43:49.797 --> 02:43:52.835
You know he's never once said
that he regrets Hiroshima?

3486
02:43:52.868 --> 02:43:55.737
He'd do it all over. Why?

3487
02:43:55.770 --> 02:43:57.205
Because it made him

3488
02:43:57.238 --> 02:43:58.874
the most important
man who ever lived.

3489
02:43:58.907 --> 02:44:01.242
(voice quivering):
Well, we've...

3490
02:44:01.275 --> 02:44:03.378
we've freely used
the atomic bomb...

3491
02:44:03.411 --> 02:44:05.513
ROBB: In fact, Doctor,
you assisted in selecting

3492
02:44:05.546 --> 02:44:06.958
the target to drop the
atomic bomb on Japan,

3493
02:44:06.982 --> 02:44:08.650
- didn't you?
- Yes.

3494
02:44:08.683 --> 02:44:10.327
ROBB: Well, then you knew,
did you not, that by dropping

3495
02:44:10.351 --> 02:44:12.520
that atomic bomb on the
target you selected,

3496
02:44:12.553 --> 02:44:13.965
that thousands of
civilians would be killed

3497
02:44:13.989 --> 02:44:15.723
or injured, is that correct?

3498
02:44:15.757 --> 02:44:17.659
Yes, not as many
as turned out...

3499
02:44:17.692 --> 02:44:19.895
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

3500
02:44:19.928 --> 02:44:21.796
- 70,000.
- ROBB: 70,000

3501
02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:22.898
at both Hiroshima and...

3502
02:44:22.931 --> 02:44:24.365
110,000 at both.

3503
02:44:24.399 --> 02:44:25.800
ROBB: On the day
of each bombing?

3504
02:44:25.834 --> 02:44:27.735
(tense music playing)

3505
02:44:27.769 --> 02:44:28.937
Yes.

3506
02:44:28.971 --> 02:44:30.547
And in the weeks and
years that followed?

3507
02:44:30.571 --> 02:44:33.274
It has been put at somewhere
between 50 and 100,000.

3508
02:44:33.307 --> 02:44:35.410
- 220,000 dead at least?
- ROBERT: Yes.

3509
02:44:35.443 --> 02:44:37.345
Any moral scruples about that?

3510
02:44:38.713 --> 02:44:39.815
Terrible ones.

3511
02:44:39.848 --> 02:44:41.416
But yet you testified in here

3512
02:44:41.449 --> 02:44:43.819
that the bombing of Hiroshima
was very successful.

3513
02:44:43.852 --> 02:44:45.420
- Technically successful.
- ROBB: Oh!

3514
02:44:45.453 --> 02:44:47.221
Technically, it was
very successful.

3515
02:44:47.255 --> 02:44:48.732
And it is also alleged to
have helped end the war.

3516
02:44:48.756 --> 02:44:50.725
Would you have been in
support of the dropping

3517
02:44:50.758 --> 02:44:52.694
of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

3518
02:44:52.727 --> 02:44:54.262
That would make no sense at all.

3519
02:44:54.295 --> 02:44:56.731
- Why?
- The-the target is too small.

3520
02:44:56.764 --> 02:44:59.267
Well, supposing there had
been a target in Japan

3521
02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:00.778
big enough for a
thermonuclear weapon,

3522
02:45:00.802 --> 02:45:02.579
would you have been opposed
to the dropping of it?

3523
02:45:02.603 --> 02:45:04.448
This was not a problem with
which I was confronted...

3524
02:45:04.472 --> 02:45:05.917
Well, I'm confronting
you with it now, sir.

3525
02:45:05.941 --> 02:45:07.709
It was all part of his plan.

3526
02:45:07.742 --> 02:45:09.310
He wanted the glorious,

3527
02:45:09.343 --> 02:45:11.512
insincere guilt of
the self-important

3528
02:45:11.546 --> 02:45:13.015
to wear like a fuckin' crown.

3529
02:45:13.048 --> 02:45:16.484
Say, "No, we cannot
go down this road,"

3530
02:45:16.517 --> 02:45:19.320
even as he knew we'd have to.

3531
02:45:19.353 --> 02:45:20.899
Would you have been
opposed to the dropping

3532
02:45:20.923 --> 02:45:22.590
of a thermonuclear
weapon on Japan

3533
02:45:22.623 --> 02:45:24.869
- because of moral scruples?
- Yes, I believe I would, sir.

3534
02:45:24.893 --> 02:45:26.594
Well, did you
oppose the dropping

3535
02:45:26.627 --> 02:45:28.639
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

3536
02:45:28.663 --> 02:45:30.307
- We set forth our arguments...
- (tense music building)

3537
02:45:30.331 --> 02:45:31.733
No, you, you, you.
I'm asking you.

3538
02:45:31.766 --> 02:45:33.410
- I set... I set forth...
- ROBB: Not we. You, you, you!

3539
02:45:33.434 --> 02:45:35.037
Our arguments
against dropping it,

3540
02:45:35.070 --> 02:45:36.604
but I did not endorse them.

3541
02:45:36.637 --> 02:45:38.339
You mean after
working night and day

3542
02:45:38.372 --> 02:45:39.741
for three years
building the bomb,

3543
02:45:39.774 --> 02:45:41.614
you then argued against
the use of it? (laughs)

3544
02:45:41.642 --> 02:45:44.345
I was asked by the
Secretary of War

3545
02:45:44.378 --> 02:45:45.747
what the views of
scientists were.

3546
02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:48.516
I gave him the views
against and the views for.

3547
02:45:48.549 --> 02:45:50.561
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

3548
02:45:50.585 --> 02:45:52.063
- What do you mean "support"?
- ROBB: Didn't you?

3549
02:45:52.087 --> 02:45:53.564
- You supported it!
- What do you mean "support"?

3550
02:45:53.588 --> 02:45:54.933
Well, you helped pick
the target, didn't you?

3551
02:45:54.957 --> 02:45:56.591
- (muffled rumbling)
- I did my job.

3552
02:45:56.624 --> 02:45:58.368
I was not in a policy-making
position at Los Alamos.

3553
02:45:58.392 --> 02:46:00.038
I would have done anything
I was asked to do.

3554
02:46:00.062 --> 02:46:02.330
Well, then you would have
built the H-bomb too,

3555
02:46:02.363 --> 02:46:03.498
- wouldn't you?
- I couldn't.

3556
02:46:03.531 --> 02:46:05.433
I didn't ask you that, Doctor!

3557
02:46:05.466 --> 02:46:07.802
And the GAC report
which you co-authored

3558
02:46:07.836 --> 02:46:09.704
after the Soviet
atomic test said

3559
02:46:09.737 --> 02:46:12.406
a Super bomb should
never be built!

3560
02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:13.775
What we meant,
what I meant was...

3561
02:46:13.808 --> 02:46:15.878
- ROBB: What you, who? Who?
- What I meant...

3562
02:46:15.911 --> 02:46:17.612
(tense music continues)

3563
02:46:17.645 --> 02:46:19.085
And wouldn't the
Russians do anything

3564
02:46:19.114 --> 02:46:21.382
- to increase their strength?
- (music stops)

3565
02:46:21.415 --> 02:46:23.393
(raises voice): If we did
it, they would have to do it.

3566
02:46:23.417 --> 02:46:25.453
Our efforts would only
fuel their efforts,

3567
02:46:25.486 --> 02:46:27.588
just as it had with
the atomic bomb.

3568
02:46:27.622 --> 02:46:31.026
"Just as it had with the
atomic bomb," exactly!

3569
02:46:31.059 --> 02:46:35.797
No moral scruples in
1945, plenty in 1949.

3570
02:46:39.935 --> 02:46:41.769
GRAY: Dr. Oppenheimer...

3571
02:46:43.437 --> 02:46:46.041
when did your strong
moral convictions develop

3572
02:46:46.074 --> 02:46:48.877
with respect to
the hydrogen bomb?

3573
02:46:55.918 --> 02:46:58.821
When it became clear to me

3574
02:46:58.854 --> 02:47:02.490
that we would tend to
use any weapon we had.

3575
02:47:04.927 --> 02:47:07.428
STRAUSS: <i>J. Robert
Oppenheimer, the martyr.</i>

3576
02:47:07.461 --> 02:47:10.065
I gave him exactly
what he wanted.

3577
02:47:10.098 --> 02:47:12.366
To be remembered for Trinity,

3578
02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:15.003
not Hiroshima,

3579
02:47:15.037 --> 02:47:17.471
not Nagasaki.

3580
02:47:20.008 --> 02:47:22.710
He should be thanking me.

3581
02:47:22.743 --> 02:47:25.680
Well, he's not.

3582
02:47:25.713 --> 02:47:27.481
(huffs)

3583
02:47:27.515 --> 02:47:29.117
Do we still have enough votes,

3584
02:47:29.151 --> 02:47:30.819
or is the crowning
moment of my career

3585
02:47:30.853 --> 02:47:34.990
about to become the most
public humiliation of my life?

3586
02:47:35.023 --> 02:47:37.592
Full Senate's about to vote.

3587
02:47:37.625 --> 02:47:38.793
You'll scrape through.

3588
02:47:38.827 --> 02:47:40.461
Great, then gather
the fucking press.

3589
02:47:40.494 --> 02:47:42.463
GRAY: Dr. J.
Robert Oppenheimer.

3590
02:47:42.496 --> 02:47:45.466
This board, having
heard testimony from you

3591
02:47:45.499 --> 02:47:48.636
and many of your current
and former colleagues,

3592
02:47:48.669 --> 02:47:50.671
has come to the
unanimous conclusion

3593
02:47:50.705 --> 02:47:53.808
that you are a loyal citizen.

3594
02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:56.744
However,

3595
02:47:56.777 --> 02:48:00.414
in the light of your
continuing associations

3596
02:48:00.448 --> 02:48:01.716
and disregard

3597
02:48:01.749 --> 02:48:03.886
for the security
apparatus of this country,

3598
02:48:03.919 --> 02:48:07.455
together with your
somewhat disturbing conduct

3599
02:48:07.488 --> 02:48:10.025
on the hydrogen bomb program

3600
02:48:10.058 --> 02:48:11.592
and the regrettable
lack of candor

3601
02:48:11.626 --> 02:48:13.996
in certain of your
responses to this board,

3602
02:48:14.029 --> 02:48:16.899
we have voted two to one

3603
02:48:16.932 --> 02:48:20.035
to deny the renewal of
your security clearance.

3604
02:48:20.068 --> 02:48:23.171
A full written opinion, with
a dissent from Mr. Evans,

3605
02:48:23.205 --> 02:48:26.707
will be issued to the
AEC in the coming days.

3606
02:48:26.741 --> 02:48:28.409
That is all.

3607
02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:33.514
- ROBB: Gordon...
- GORDON: Roger.

3608
02:48:33.547 --> 02:48:35.416
(indistinct exchange)

3609
02:48:38.552 --> 02:48:40.454
KITTY: <i>Robert.</i>

3610
02:48:41.089 --> 02:48:42.623
(on phone): Robert.

3611
02:48:45.093 --> 02:48:46.594
Don't...

3612
02:48:48.964 --> 02:48:52.167
Don't take in the sheets.
(breathes heavily)

3613
02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:53.534
(clamoring)

3614
02:48:53.567 --> 02:48:54.970
REPORTER: Get a
picture with him.

3615
02:48:55.003 --> 02:48:56.238
REPORTERS: Sir, sir.

3616
02:48:56.271 --> 02:48:58.739
SENATE AIDE: Two
minutes. Two minutes.

3617
02:48:58.773 --> 02:48:59.984
- You'll get your shot.
- REPORTER 1: Please, sir.

3618
02:49:00.008 --> 02:49:01.575
We've been waiting for so long.

3619
02:49:01.609 --> 02:49:02.619
- REPORTER 2: Evening, sir.
- REPORTER 3: Come out.

3620
02:49:02.643 --> 02:49:03.678
REPORTER 4: Sir, sir!

3621
02:49:03.711 --> 02:49:05.047
STRAUSS: Is it official?

3622
02:49:07.149 --> 02:49:08.549
SENATE AIDE: Well, there were,

3623
02:49:08.582 --> 02:49:11.719
uh, a couple of
unexpected holdouts.

3624
02:49:11.752 --> 02:49:13.889
(solemn music playing)

3625
02:49:16.158 --> 02:49:18.827
I'm denied. Yeah?

3626
02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:20.829
- I'm afraid so, sir.
- All right.

3627
02:49:28.536 --> 02:49:29.603
Who were the holdouts?

3628
02:49:29.637 --> 02:49:32.573
Um, there were three,

3629
02:49:32.606 --> 02:49:35.543
led by the junior senator
from Massachusetts.

3630
02:49:35.576 --> 02:49:36.988
Young guy trying to
make a name for himself,

3631
02:49:37.012 --> 02:49:39.580
didn't like what you
did to Oppenheimer.

3632
02:49:39.613 --> 02:49:40.748
What's his name?

3633
02:49:40.781 --> 02:49:42.985
Uh, Kennedy.

3634
02:49:43.018 --> 02:49:44.820
John F. Kennedy.

3635
02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:49.690
Kitty?

3636
02:49:55.763 --> 02:49:59.167
Did you think that if you
let them tar and feather you,

3637
02:49:59.201 --> 02:50:01.769
that the world
would forgive you?

3638
02:50:05.307 --> 02:50:06.741
It won't.

3639
02:50:09.111 --> 02:50:10.511
We'll see.

3640
02:50:20.288 --> 02:50:22.290
Goddamn it.

3641
02:50:22.324 --> 02:50:23.791
(sighs)

3642
02:50:23.825 --> 02:50:26.761
(chuckles wryly) You
told me I'd be okay.

3643
02:50:26.794 --> 02:50:29.164
Yeah, well, I didn't have
all the facts, did I?

3644
02:50:29.197 --> 02:50:30.765
Here's a fact.

3645
02:50:30.798 --> 02:50:32.642
President Eisenhower
pinned the Medal of Freedom

3646
02:50:32.666 --> 02:50:34.102
on my chest last year

3647
02:50:34.136 --> 02:50:36.637
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

3648
02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:39.174
They don't want me
in the Cabinet room?

3649
02:50:39.207 --> 02:50:41.642
Well, that's... that's fine.

3650
02:50:41.675 --> 02:50:44.012
Maybe they should just
invite Oppenheimer instead.

3651
02:50:44.046 --> 02:50:45.080
Maybe they will.

3652
02:50:46.081 --> 02:50:47.315
I told you,

3653
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:49.985
he turned the scientists
against me one by one,

3654
02:50:50.018 --> 02:50:52.187
starting with Einstein. I
told you about, uh, Einstein.

3655
02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:53.654
I saw him by the pond.

3656
02:50:53.687 --> 02:50:55.190
You did, but you know, sir,

3657
02:50:55.223 --> 02:50:57.225
since nobody really knows

3658
02:50:57.259 --> 02:50:58.894
what they said to
each other that day,

3659
02:50:58.927 --> 02:51:02.964
is it possible they didn't
talk about you at all?

3660
02:51:02.998 --> 02:51:06.134
Is it possible they spoke
about something, uh,

3661
02:51:06.168 --> 02:51:07.601
more important?

3662
02:51:07.635 --> 02:51:09.071
REPORTERS: Mr. Strauss!

3663
02:51:09.104 --> 02:51:10.805
(clamoring)

3664
02:51:12.407 --> 02:51:14.809
Over here! Mr. Strauss!

3665
02:51:17.946 --> 02:51:21.216
Oh. (chuckling)

3666
02:51:21.249 --> 02:51:22.350
(gentle music playing)

3667
02:51:22.384 --> 02:51:23.684
Thank you.

3668
02:51:23.717 --> 02:51:26.221
- (laughing)
- Albert.

3669
02:51:26.254 --> 02:51:28.223
- Ah.
- (clears throat)

3670
02:51:28.256 --> 02:51:30.758
The man of the moment.

3671
02:51:33.862 --> 02:51:37.232
You once held a-a
reception for me.

3672
02:51:37.265 --> 02:51:39.067
In Berkeley. You
gave me an award.

3673
02:51:39.101 --> 02:51:40.969
- Hmm?
- Yes.

3674
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:44.272
You all thought that
I had lost the ability

3675
02:51:44.306 --> 02:51:47.242
to understand what I'd started.

3676
02:51:47.275 --> 02:51:50.711
So the award really
wasn't for me,

3677
02:51:50.744 --> 02:51:53.148
it was for all of you, hmm?

3678
02:51:55.016 --> 02:51:57.018
Now it's your turn

3679
02:51:57.052 --> 02:52:01.755
to deal with the consequences
of your achievement.

3680
02:52:02.690 --> 02:52:03.992
And one day,

3681
02:52:04.025 --> 02:52:06.660
when they've punished
you enough...

3682
02:52:08.063 --> 02:52:11.967
they'll serve you
salmon and potato salad.

3683
02:52:15.703 --> 02:52:17.738
Make speeches...

3684
02:52:18.772 --> 02:52:20.275
<i>give you a medal.</i>

3685
02:52:20.308 --> 02:52:21.943
(applause)

3686
02:52:21.977 --> 02:52:24.146
Hello, Frank.

3687
02:52:24.179 --> 02:52:25.413
You're happy, I'm happy.

3688
02:52:25.447 --> 02:52:27.949
(gentle music continues)

3689
02:52:32.387 --> 02:52:35.723
EINSTEIN: <i>Pat you on the back,
tell you all is forgiven.</i>

3690
02:52:37.259 --> 02:52:39.660
<i>Just remember...</i>

3691
02:52:40.295 --> 02:52:42.164
<i>it won't be for you.</i>

3692
02:52:46.434 --> 02:52:48.069
<i>It'll be for them.</i>

3693
02:52:50.804 --> 02:52:53.041
(suspenseful music playing)

3694
02:53:02.217 --> 02:53:03.751
Albert.

3695
02:53:04.986 --> 02:53:08.456
When I came to you with
those calculations,

3696
02:53:08.490 --> 02:53:10.724
we thought we might
start a chain reaction

3697
02:53:10.758 --> 02:53:14.229
that would destroy
the entire world.

3698
02:53:14.262 --> 02:53:17.731
Mm, I remember it well.

3699
02:53:17.765 --> 02:53:19.834
What of it?

3700
02:53:22.470 --> 02:53:24.206
I believe we did.

3701
02:53:24.239 --> 02:53:26.508
(suspenseful music continues)

3702
02:53:26.541 --> 02:53:28.977
(rhythmic stomping)

3703
02:53:42.857 --> 02:53:44.758
(music tempo quickening)

3704
02:53:44.792 --> 02:53:46.928
(engine rumbling)

3705
02:53:53.969 --> 02:53:56.004
(up-tempo music continues)

3706
02:54:07.582 --> 02:54:09.985

3707
02:54:12.587 --> 02:54:15.290
