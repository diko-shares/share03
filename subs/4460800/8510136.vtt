00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.916
<i>Good morning!
You're with the Lord.</i>

2
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.708
<i>It's 7:00 a.m. You know what time it is.</i>

3
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:11.125
<i>It's the Lord,
Lord Kitchener, live and direct,</i>

4
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:13.541
<i>strong from the Kitchen on Kitchen Radio.</i>

5
00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:17.541
<i>Bad news, guys. They've gone and done it.
Water in the West Wing is out.</i>

6
00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:21.125
<i>I repeat, water in the West Wing is out.</i>

7
00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:24.541
<i>Water is still available in the east,
but only go if you need.</i>

8
00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:27.333
<i>Only go if you sweat in your sleep.</i>

9
00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.541
<i>Only go if your mattress is drenched.</i>

10
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.166
<i>You hear me?</i>

11
00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.041
Get out!

12
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.416
Come on, man!
We can't be waiting all day.

13
00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.458
- Come on!
- Hurry up, man.

14
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.041
Get out!

15
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:33.208
It ain't personal.

16
00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:35.833
We want this.

17
00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:37.791
Not you.

18
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:42.841
<i>It's time
for birthday shout-outs.</i>

19
00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:44.583
<i>Happy 45th birthday to Sherry-Ann.</i>

20
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:47.916
<i>Love from Todd,
Neilson, and the whole family.</i>

21
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.916
<i>You've got 30 minutes
to send in all your birthday shout-outs.</i>

22
00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:58.291
What a fucking...

23
00:02:58.375 --> 00:02:59.958
About time, mate.

24
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.500
Finally. Better late than never.

25
00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.000
Need to make a shower.

26
00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.041
No water.

27
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:11.041
Seriously?

28
00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:17.250
<i>Messages coming in.
Remember that at 10:00 p.m...</i>

29
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.250
{\an8}<i>Isaac, after your eight-month wait,</i>

30
00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:42.916
<i>your new Buena Vida
single-occupancy flat is ready.</i>

31
00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.226
- Yo, bust that door.
- Everyone together...

32
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.208
<i>Okay, listen,
the food is coming in</i>

33
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:12.750
<i>on the north side of the market.</i>

34
00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:16.000
<i>Food coming in north side of the market.</i>

35
00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:18.208
No! We don't want money!

36
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:21.833
<i>If you've got extra tins,
stay back.</i>

37
00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:24.291
It's still there. It's still there.
Just wait. Wait.

38
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:27.333
<i>Only go if you need.</i>

39
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.541
<i>Only go if you need.
We gotta look out for each other.</i>

40
00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.458
- Take it.
- Turn it off! Turn it off!

41
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.583
Take that! Take that!

42
00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:46.541
- Hey!
- That's how we like it!

43
00:04:46.625 --> 00:04:48.916
<i>I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.</i>

44
00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:50.875
Take that.

45
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.208
<i>They can't stop we.</i>

46
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:57.166
<i>You hear me?</i>

47
00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:06.208
At times like these,
it's important to think about yourself.

48
00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:08.000
After <i>your</i> transition,

49
00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:11.916
your tree will spend
a few weeks here in our incubator.

50
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.166
We call that the mourning period.

51
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.833
So, during that time,
family can visit as much as they like.

52
00:06:17.916 --> 00:06:19.250
Where you going to put me?

53
00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:24.500
The trees get sent
to a... ecological restoration project.

54
00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:31.875
Somewhere you can, um... lay your roots.

55
00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.750
- You don't have a clue.
- Dad!

56
00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:35.541
I don't want to be a fuckin' bush!

57
00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:40.416
Uh, Jase, um, do you mind showing
this family our selection of urns, please?

58
00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:43.541
My pleasure. Could you just
follow me this way, please?

59
00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:48.291
Won't have a grave to visit.

60
00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:51.228
- Won't know where I am.
- Yo.

61
00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:53.791
You're from the Kitchen, right?

62
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.416
Do you really think
your family wanna be here?

63
00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.958
No.

64
00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:06.875
Do you not think
if they could afford to do more,

65
00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:08.625
they would do more?

66
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.666
I <i>wish</i> my dad prepared me
way more for his death.

67
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:17.791
'Cause it was like

68
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:21.250
one moment he's there, next minute gone,

69
00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:24.750
and anything that was left around,
like money or whatever, had to go

70
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.416
all on a funeral.

71
00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:29.916
You know?

72
00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:32.750
You ever been to a Nigerian funeral?

73
00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.083
Last one I went to lasted three weeks.

74
00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:40.958
Exactly.

75
00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.458
You know, imagine a nine night
on top of that.

76
00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:47.875
You know, it's a lot.

77
00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:02.541
What'd you say to him?

78
00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:07.125
Dad's Nigerian funeral.

79
00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:08.833
You're a cunt.

80
00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:11.125
Well, commission ain't gonna make itself,
is it?

81
00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.208
Serious?

82
00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.125
Tellin' you, that's why I ain't staying
in that shithole

83
00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:16.958
for one second longer
than I have to, mate.

84
00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:18.958
"Shithole"?

85
00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:22.458
- Yeah, shithole.
- It's our home.

86
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:24.250
"It's our ho..." You always say that.

87
00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:27.375
Bruv, keep that same energy when
they drag you out kickin' and screamin'.

88
00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:29.375
Yeah, but we're not doing that. <i>They</i> are.

89
00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:31.958
Aight.

90
00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:33.875
Cool.

91
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:36.208
I'm just letting you know, innit?

92
00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.333
When shit gets real,
I'm saving myself out here.

93
00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.208
They won't get the Kitchen.

94
00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:45.416
They <i>will</i> get the Kitchen.

95
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.416
- It ain't happenin', fam.
- It's 'appening.

96
00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:53.458
I'm telling you.

97
00:08:55.083 --> 00:08:56.083
It is.

98
00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:00.041
I don't give a shit anyway.

99
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.083
- Aight.
- Aight.

100
00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:38.833
Toni was
a mother, friend, neighbor.

101
00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:42.750
She will be missed so much
by everyone who knew and loved her.

102
00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:10.000
Now I'd like to invite Toni's son forward
to say a few... final words.

103
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.500
Benji.

104
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:24.666
Would you like to say
a few words to your mum?

105
00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.291
Earth to earth.

106
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.500
Roots to roots.

107
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.208
Life to life.

108
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.625
Come and see her
as much as you want... until she's moved on.

109
00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:30.875
Yo.

110
00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:34.333
How'd you know my mum?

111
00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:38.625
- I don't.
- You was at the funeral.

112
00:12:39.916 --> 00:12:40.916
I work here.

113
00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:43.625
You don't look like
you was here because of work.

114
00:12:48.666 --> 00:12:49.791
Yeah, I knew your mum.

115
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.333
From way back.

116
00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:55.916
- Way back? Way back when?
- Yeah, just way back.

117
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.916
- When you were together?
- No.

118
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.291
- Sexually?
- What you... Oi, what you talking about?

119
00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.666
Fuckin' barely knew your mum, man.
That's it.

120
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:07.041
What?

121
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.666
I just thought
my dad might've shown up today.

122
00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:18.291
Guess he didn't.

123
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.625
Sick.

124
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.166
- This is <i>your</i> bike?
- Move from me, man.

125
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.791
- Can I have a go? I'm good on bikes.
- No. Move, man.

126
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:33.750
- Let me just show...
- Yo, yo, yo, move.

127
00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:36.416
- Man, let me just show you.
- Hey, hey. Listen.

128
00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:38.916
It was your mum's funeral today, man.

129
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:41.791
Yeah, I get it.

130
00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:45.875
Don't wanna have to tell you
to fuck off.

131
00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:39.375
What?

132
00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.500
Do you wanna ride or not?

133
00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:18.666
So where d'you live?

134
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500
Kitchen.

135
00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:26.875
The Kitchen?!

136
00:15:27.416 --> 00:15:28.416
Yeah.

137
00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:31.500
Why you say it like that? You know it?

138
00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:34.708
Is it really like what they say it's like?

139
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:35.791
What? A shithole?

140
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.500
Yeah.

141
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:41.041
My mum...

142
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.541
She said my dad lives there.

143
00:15:53.083 --> 00:15:54.166
I best go, Benji.

144
00:16:01.708 --> 00:16:03.125

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:21.625
Aight, Benji.

175
00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:28.666
Come.

176
00:21:46.583 --> 00:21:47.750
Ah, I'm hungry.

177
00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:49.708
Ah, bruv, totally.

178
00:21:54.208 --> 00:21:55.875
Feelin' for some wings, man.

179
00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:57.833
Yes, yes.

180
00:21:57.916 --> 00:21:59.767
- Jeez!
- What's everyone sayin'?

181
00:21:59.791 --> 00:22:00.625
Yo.

182
00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:02.916
Good, yeah?
Why is everyone moving all tired?

183
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.958
- Just been chillin' all day, man.
- You're lazy, bruv.

184
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:08.875
- What you sayin'? You good?
- This is Benji.

185
00:22:09.833 --> 00:22:13.500
Kid's nuts on the bike, you know?
Wheelies, all of that.

186
00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:15.416
You sayin' better than me?

187
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.333
Ah... It'll get there.
It'll get there.

188
00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:22.125
Oi, Oozie, can you show him
to the bedrooms and that?

189
00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:23.625
Yeah.

190
00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:26.583
Come, little man.

191
00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:29.208
Tryin' to get some yard food,
I'm not gonna lie.

192
00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:32.875
You sayin' yard food? What, the Jerk Hut?

193
00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:37.291
- There's that Ghanaian spot, still.
- Stop tryna sit around, fam, dead.

194
00:24:26.583 --> 00:24:28.423
<i>Good morning!
You're with the Lord.</i>

195
00:24:28.458 --> 00:24:30.625
<i>It's 7:00 a.m. You know what time it is.</i>

196
00:24:30.708 --> 00:24:31.708
<i>This the Lord.</i>

197
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:36.291
<i>Lord Kitchener, live and direct,
strong from the Kitchen on Kitchen Radio.</i>

198
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.041
<i>Time for good news hour.</i>

199
00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:03.500
<i>Messages comin' in. Whoa!
One second. Back up, back up, team.</i>

200
00:25:03.583 --> 00:25:06.125
<i>He's on one knee right now as we speak.</i>

201
00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:09.708
<i>Will you marry 'im, Rox?
Will you marry 'im?</i>

202
00:25:10.208 --> 00:25:13.458
<i>He's waiting for your answer.
Let's hope it's good news.</i>

203
00:25:13.541 --> 00:25:15.541
Over this, man.
I'm tryin' to go home.

204
00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:16.916
Hey, where we goin'?

205
00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:22.333
This is serious.

206
00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:24.375
Oooh!

207
00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:28.208
Hey, this thing's lookin' mad!

208
00:25:32.708 --> 00:25:36.750
- Gimme that. I am a top marksman.
- Don't forget your age, you know.

209
00:25:37.458 --> 00:25:38.958
Come on, Stapes, ling it.

210
00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:40.125
That's it.

211
00:25:46.208 --> 00:25:48.541
- Come 'ere.
- What? Load me up properly.

212
00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:50.708
- Get me a big one.
- I got my money on you.

213
00:25:50.791 --> 00:25:53.166
- Yeah, of course you should.
- Steady, now.

214
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.916
- All righty...
- What's that?

215
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.125
Police drones.

216
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:02.833
- See?
- Hey, get up, man!

217
00:26:02.916 --> 00:26:06.291
- That was nowhere near.
- I'll give it to you. I'll give it to him.

218
00:26:06.875 --> 00:26:09.541
- You wanna turn, innit?
- Nah, I'm cool, man.

219
00:26:09.625 --> 00:26:11.500
- Go, go.
- Go on, man.

220
00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:12.583
You want to go.

221
00:26:12.625 --> 00:26:15.458
- I don't.
- Go, go, go. Go, bruv.

222
00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:16.750
Come on, bruv.

223
00:26:16.833 --> 00:26:19.114
- Go.
- Should've done it the first time.

224
00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:21.606
- No pressure, innit?
- There's bare pressure.

225
00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:23.708
There's pressure, I can't lie.
Are you ready?

226
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:25.583
You got this, bro. You got this.

227
00:26:25.666 --> 00:26:28.125
- One in the middle.
- Show us what you got.

228
00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:30.625
- Lower, lower.
- Go back. Go back.

229
00:26:30.708 --> 00:26:32.500
Get lower. Get lower. Lower.

230
00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:34.503
Now bring it back.
Come on, you got this.

231
00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:36.250
Come on, Benji. Slap it.

232
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.291
- Lower! Lower!
- He ain't there yet.

233
00:26:38.375 --> 00:26:39.916
That's it.

234
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.625
- Right here.
- Steady.

235
00:26:41.708 --> 00:26:43.375
- Don't let go yet.
- Power.

236
00:26:44.583 --> 00:26:46.500
- Come on.
- That's it.

237
00:26:46.583 --> 00:26:48.541
- Hurry up!
- Release it, bruv.

238
00:27:45.291 --> 00:27:47.416
Bro, all you do is hate, bro.

239
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.083
This guy's just hatin'. See him?
Took him at least three or four times.

240
00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:52.291
Kamale about ten times.

241
00:27:52.375 --> 00:27:55.000
What do you mean, blud?
Eight and a half. Be precise.

242
00:27:55.083 --> 00:27:58.458
You gotta change up them drip.
You look like you're goin' school, my boy.

243
00:27:58.541 --> 00:28:01.291
Did all right, bro.
You did good. You did good.

244
00:28:01.791 --> 00:28:02.791
Benji.

245
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:06.791
Hey, Benji.

246
00:28:07.875 --> 00:28:09.750
- What you sayin'? You good?
- Yeah.

247
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.708
I'll meet you lot later.

248
00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:22.875
- I was looking for you, you know.
- Yeah?

249
00:28:24.333 --> 00:28:25.333
Yeah.

250
00:28:25.875 --> 00:28:27.541
But doesn't even matter anymore.

251
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:29.416
Oi!

252
00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:34.541
What you doin' rollin' with these guys?

253
00:28:37.125 --> 00:28:38.125
Why do you care?

254
00:28:55.041 --> 00:28:58.625
<i>You are illegally occupying
privately owned property.</i>

255
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.375
<i>You are illegally occupying
privately owned property.</i>

256
00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:06.291
<i>You are illegally occupying

257
00:29:07.333 --> 00:29:10.750
<i>You are illegally occupying

258
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.291
<i>You are illegally occupying

259
00:29:13.375 --> 00:29:14.416
Hurry up!

260
00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:17.333
Move, move! Move!

261
00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:21.666
<i>You are illegally occupying
privately owned property.</i>

262
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.666
<i>You must vacate
these premises immediately.</i>

263
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.083
<i>You must vacate these...</i>

264
00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:28.000
Oi!

265
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Shut it.

266
00:29:34.208 --> 00:29:35.291
Close the shutter.

267
00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:37.958
Close the shutter!

268
00:29:40.041 --> 00:29:42.041
What's happening?

269
00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:42.958
Don't.

270
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.333
Get me the fuck out!

271
00:29:52.166 --> 00:29:53.208
Get back!

272
00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:55.208
What's happening?

273
00:29:56.083 --> 00:29:57.083
The end.

274
00:30:00.583 --> 00:30:01.583
Hmm?

275
00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:04.083
Wanted to know what it's like, right?

276
00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:08.208
Well, you'll find out
rolling with them man.

277
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.708
You ain't built like them.

278
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Leave 'em alone.

279
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:20.791
Fine.

280
00:30:22.958 --> 00:30:24.208
I'll stay away from them.

281
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Yeah. Good.

282
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.250
Get down!

283
00:30:31.416 --> 00:30:33.958
Get the fuck off me!

284
00:30:34.041 --> 00:30:35.541
Only if you let me stay with you.

285
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.750
No.

286
00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:41.041
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

287
00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:43.083
It's either I stay here
or I stay with Staples.

288
00:30:43.166 --> 00:30:44.916
Then you're staying with Staples.

289
00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:55.375
Two nights.

290
00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:10.625
Benji,
I'm getting outta this place myself,

291
00:31:10.708 --> 00:31:12.541
so those two nights are two nights.

292
00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:16.166
You're okay with that?

293
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.166
It's cool. Thank you.

294
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.125
What's this?

295
00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:35.833
Pillow and a blanket.

296
00:31:36.416 --> 00:31:37.833
This is a bag and a towel.

297
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.291
Yeah, well, things can be other things.

298
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Are you just gonna be looking at me
takin' a shit?

299
00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:56.541
I'm not even criticizin'.
Happy to be here.

300
00:32:13.958 --> 00:32:15.478
<i>This is the Lord.</i>

301
00:32:16.458 --> 00:32:17.458
<i>Lord Kitchener,</i>

302
00:32:18.958 --> 00:32:20.708
<i>live and direct,</i>

303
00:32:20.791 --> 00:32:24.541
<i>strong from the Kitchen... on Kitchen Radio.</i>

304
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.875
<i>I know how you feel.</i>

305
00:32:30.625 --> 00:32:31.666
<i>I feel it too.</i>

306
00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:34.583
<i>They did it in Aylesbury.</i>

307
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.416
<i>They did it in Broadwater.</i>

308
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.125
<i>They did it in Mozart.</i>

309
00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:40.708
But remember,

310
00:32:41.708 --> 00:32:43.208
they ordered us to leave,

311
00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:46.875
and we said, "No. This is our home."

312
00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:48.791
"We ain't goin' nowhere."

313
00:32:50.291 --> 00:32:53.125
They cut our water,
they cut our supplies, and we said, "No."

314
00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:55.750
"Fuck you. We ain't goin' nowhere."

315
00:32:57.708 --> 00:32:58.708
Now,

316
00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:01.041
the target is us.

317
00:33:03.625 --> 00:33:04.625
The target is us.

318
00:33:08.791 --> 00:33:09.875
I'm going to work.

319
00:33:12.541 --> 00:33:13.791
You can take a shit now.

320
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.500
Izi.

321
00:33:25.125 --> 00:33:29.333
Can you make sure my mum's all right?
Make sure she's gettin', um...

322
00:33:30.083 --> 00:33:34.041
Make sure she's got water, sunlight,
sh... everything she needs.

323
00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:36.708
<i>If you can't get through
to someone, let me know.</i>

324
00:33:36.791 --> 00:33:38.625
You know what, man? Come on. Get up.

325
00:33:39.875 --> 00:33:41.166
You're coming in with me.

326
00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:44.263
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again,

327
00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:47.625
and I will continue to say it
until I breathe no more.

328
00:33:49.708 --> 00:33:50.833
They can't stop we.

329
00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:54.583
<i>They can only stop we</i>

330
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.750
<i>if we see we as I.</i>

331
00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:03.583
<i>Let's change the vibe real quick.</i>

332
00:34:06.166 --> 00:34:07.166
Melanie?

333
00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:12.333
Is it safe?

334
00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:24.083
Benji, come on.

335
00:35:28.625 --> 00:35:29.958
Go on, then. One more time.

336
00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:33.250
Okay. Um... When my mum passed,

337
00:35:34.375 --> 00:35:40.000
I'm so glad she upgraded
to... the Long Farewell...

338
00:35:40.083 --> 00:35:41.375
- No, man.
- ...Package?

339
00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:44.000
- You said you got it.
- I just said it.

340
00:35:44.666 --> 00:35:46.291
The <i>Fond</i> Farewell Package.

341
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.708
- The Fond Farewell Package.
- Yeah.

342
00:35:49.333 --> 00:35:51.791
Because... it eased the pain of her passing.

343
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.375
Robotic, man. Come on.
Say it one more time. Come on.

344
00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:01.583
I don't even understand.
What's the Long Farewell Package?

345
00:36:01.666 --> 00:36:03.958
- It's the <i>Fond</i> Farewell Package.
- Fond.

346
00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:06.750

00:36:13.708 --> 00:36:17.416
So... you can come and see her
as much as you want.

351
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:21.125
And this is our friend Benji here.

352
00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:24.166

- Yeah.

353
00:36:24.958 --> 00:36:27.833
Benji was just telling me about... his loss.

354
00:36:28.833 --> 00:36:30.583

00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:33.708

00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:39.333

358
00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:45.750

I miss her every hour she's gone.

363
00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:05.250
It feels like she's still kinda here.

364
00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:12.000

365
00:37:20.333 --> 00:37:21.333

686
00:55:33.666 --> 00:55:36.083
