00:25:56.847 --> 00:26:02.101
Hey. Open your eyes, man.
You'll feel a lot better.

343
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:09.567
Boom! Come on, man. Sit your ass up.

344
00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:17.033
Who are you?

345
00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:22.080
I'm the Zig-Zag man. Who are you?

346
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:25.458
- I'm a cop. Watch out!
- Don't shoot nobody.

347
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:28.086
Get that beer in you for ballast.

348
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:32.048
- No, man.
- Get it in you. You'll feel better.

349
00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:50.775
Stop the car!

350
00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:52.985
Stop the car! I saw something!

351
00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:54.612
- Just relax.
- Stop!

352
00:26:54.863 --> 00:26:57.782
All right! Hold the fuck on... Hey!

353
00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:06.707
Fuck me, man! Shit.

354
00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:11.879
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

355
00:27:12.089 --> 00:27:15.007
- I'm gonna fuck you too, cop!
- Get the...

356

Go ahead, cowboy,
you got mad squabbles.

361
00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:13.482
- Thanks for the help.
- You should've shot them.

362
00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:15.026
What's happening?

363
00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:17.612
- You're dead!
- Okay! Wait! Hold it!

364

- You too, white boy!
- Okay...

365
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:23.201
- My cousins will blast you fools!
- Calm down.

366
00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:25.745
- Calm down. You okay?
- No, I'm not!

367

You almost became the ditch party.

- We gonna let them go?

378

They should be off the streets.

You been there?

383
00:29:17.547 --> 00:29:20.174
- You'll grab your ankles.
- Suck my dick!

384
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:23.386

386
00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:27.723
- Got nothing?
- No.

387
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:29.267
- You sure?
- Yeah.

388
00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:32.687
- Where's your horn?
- Got none.

389
00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:37.525
You got money, though.

390
00:29:37.734 --> 00:29:41.404
You lied to me!

391

00:29:55.419 --> 00:29:57.628
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?

394
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.556
Turn around, sucker. Turn around.

395
00:30:10.142 --> 00:30:12.101
So you like raping girls?

396
00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:15.813

- No, man.

399
00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:25.448
Told me to suck your dick.
Is that what you said?

00:30:27.284 --> 00:30:28.451
Look at me.

401
00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:32.455
You wanted me
to suck your dick, right?

402
00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:34.874
Isn't that what you said?

403
00:30:35.083 --> 00:30:38.419
Didn't you say suck it?
Don't lie. Am I a liar?

404
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.962
You didn't say that?

405
00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:43.799
That's not what you said?
So I'm lying?

406

Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

lost their money.

- I heard you.

- I'm glad. Put it in the glove box.
