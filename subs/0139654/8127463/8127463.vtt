1
00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:24.043
It's time.

2
00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:27.588
Hey there...

3
00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:31.509
...good morning. How are you today?

4
00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.053
Hey. What are you doing up?

5
00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:35.263
Moo.

6
00:01:37.014 --> 00:01:38.516
Is that Daddy?

7
00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:44.689
Hey there, cowgirl.

8
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.276
She's a little feisty today.

9
00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:51.404
Babies should be sleeping.

10
00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:55.241
"I'm too hungry
for my own good." Yes.

11
00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:00.579
I gotta get ready.

12
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:09.297
Wrong day to be forgetting stuff.

13
00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:12.758
You know how lucky you are.
Don't screw this up.

14
00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:14.927
All right! Jesus.

15
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:19.098
- She go back to sleep?
- Yes. Ate like a pig.

16
00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:24.645
I know I'm lucky. I ace this job,
the department's wide open.

17
00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:29.442
Get my own division someday.
You should see their houses.

18
00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:37.658
Hello?

19
00:02:41.412 --> 00:02:42.413
Well, yes.

20
00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:44.832
Don't worry, I will.

21
00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:47.960
He's right here. <i>It’s Alonzo.</i>

22
00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:55.926
- Hello.
<i>- Hoyt?</i>

23
00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:57.178
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:57.428 --> 00:03:00.097
<i>- Going to roll call?</i>
- I'm leaving now.

25
00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:01.432
<i>- Hoyt?</i>
- Yes, sir?

26
00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.186
<i>- Fairies go to roll call. We don't.</i>
- Good to know.

27
00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:08.564
<i>There's a coffee shop on 7th.
Be there at 10.</i>

28
00:03:08.773 --> 00:03:12.318
<i>Be in comfortable shoes.
Got a backup gun?</i>

29
00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:16.322
- Only the standard issue Beretta.
<i>- Bring it. Cuffs too.</i>

30
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.992
<i>Maybe we'll do some business.
We're aggressive.</i>

31
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.872
I know. That's why I signed up.
I want to thank you for this...

32
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.716
What's wrong?

33
00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.388
Feels like football tryouts.

34
00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:44.558
I wish it was tomorrow
so I'd know if I made the squad.

35
00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:47.520
Listen, it's not tomorrow, it's today.

36
00:03:48.187 --> 00:03:51.524
- I know it's gonna work out.
- You do?

37
00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:16.340
Good morning, sir.

38
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:22.054
No, thank you, ma'am.

39
00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:24.723
Get some chow in you.
My dollar.

40
00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:27.226
Thank you, sir, but I ate.

41
00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:28.727
Fine. Don't.

42
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:37.027
It's nice here.

43
00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:39.447
May I read?

44
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:42.366
- I'm sorry, sir. I...
- Thank you.

45
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:47.037
- I'll get something to eat.
- Hell, no you won't. You fucked up.

46
00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:49.832
I'm trying to read. Please shut up.

47
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.063
I'll like not being in a hot
black and white all summer.

48
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:20.279
Tell me a story, Hoyt.

49
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.242
- Like my story?
- Not your story, a story.

50
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.080
Since you can't shut up
so I can read, tell me a story.

51
00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.416
- I don't know any.
- You don't?

52
00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.168
- No.
- I'll tell you one.

53
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.672
This is a newspaper, right?
It's 90 percent bullshit.

54
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:41.425
But it's entertaining. So I read it.

55
00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:46.347
It entertains me. You won't let me
read it, so you entertain me.

56
00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:48.641
Tell me a story now. Go.

57
00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:52.144
- There was a DUI stop.
- A DUI stop?

58
00:05:52.353 --> 00:05:54.021
Let me load up!

59
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.233
- A DUI? Oh, shit!
- Well, I...

60
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.444
- Listen, we were on midwatch...
- We who?

61
00:06:00.653 --> 00:06:03.614
- Oh, me and Debbie.
- Who's Debbie?

62
00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:06.992
Debbie Maxwell, my training officer.

63
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.412
- A female training officer?
- Yes, sir.

64
00:06:10.663 --> 00:06:13.832
Okay. All right.

65
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.709
Was she black, white?

66
00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:17.294
She was white.

67
00:06:18.462 --> 00:06:20.714
- Lick-her license?
- A what?

68
00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:24.301
A lick-her license.
Was she a dyke, a lesbian?

69
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.805
- Is she any good?
- She's pretty good.

70
00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.432
- Okay, Debbie, midwatch. Go.
- Right.

71
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:32.726
- It was a quiet night...
- Boom!

72
00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:36.855
- What the fuck?
- You never know, that's the point. Go.

73
00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:39.567
It was quiet and we're rolling...

74
00:06:39.817 --> 00:06:43.320
...I'm driving. This Acura,
just a beautiful car...

75
00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:48.242
...comes out a side street, all over
the median. I hit the wailer.

76
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.704
He drives for 10 blocks
before he pulls over.

77
00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:54.832
Plates run clean,
so I test and arrest.

78
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.335
I'm belting in our unit,
and she's tossing his car.

79
00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:03.299
She shows me a .38
and two loaded shotguns.

80
00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:06.051
- No shit?
- No shit! So...

81
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.097
...she calls and I'm searching.
I find 500 grams of meth.

82
00:07:10.306 --> 00:07:13.225
Turns out he's on bail
for distribution...

83
00:07:13.684 --> 00:07:17.062
...on his way to smoke
his ex-partner before trial.

84
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:18.314
Boom.

85
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:22.067
- Prevented a murder.
- You got him. It's amazing.

86
00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:25.195
It is. That you're out there...

87
00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:30.576
...with a fine bitch for a year and
the best story you can tell me...

88
00:07:30.826 --> 00:07:32.536
...is a drunk stop.

89
00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:40.294
But I don't believe you.
You tapped that ass, didn't you?

90
00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.132
Tell the truth.
You know you tapped that ass.

91
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.259
In the back, barn! Code X.

92
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.220
- I got a wife.
- You got a dick.

93
00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.099
- You do have one, don't you?
- Yes.

94
00:07:54.308 --> 00:07:58.771
Your dick lines up straight.
Right and left of it are pockets.

95
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:02.816
In those pockets are money.
Look in either one. Pay the bill.

96
00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:15.371
Grab that menu off that window for me.

97
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:24.171
Get in, it's unlocked.

98
00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:32.012
Throw that in the glove box.

99
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:36.141
- This is not from the motor pool.
- No. Sexy, though, huh?

100
00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:41.480
- Where's the office, at division?
- You're in the office.

101
00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.359
Going up.

102
00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:12.219
Today is a training day.

103
00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:15.556
Give you a taste of the business.

104
00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:18.350
I got 38 cases pending trial...

105
00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:21.812
...63 active investigations,
250 I can't clear.

106
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:25.190
I supervise five officers.
Five personalities.

107
00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.152
Five sets of problems.
You could be six.

108
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.738
I ain't holding no hands.

109
00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:33.949
You got today to show me
what you're made of.

110
00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:38.203
You don't like Narcotics,
get the fuck out of my car...

111
00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:41.540
...get a job chasing bad checks.
You hear me?

112
00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:43.333
- I hear you.
- Okay.

113
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.921
Why do you want to be a narc?

114
00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:52.718
To serve my community by ridding
it of dangerous drugs.

115
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.762
Right, but why a narc?

116
00:09:57.139 --> 00:09:58.891
I want to make detective.

117
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.976
Stick with me, you can do it.

118
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.604
Unlearn that academy shit.

119
00:10:03.854 --> 00:10:06.690
Don't bring that here.
It'll get you killed.

120
00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:09.276
I'll do anything you want me to do.

121
00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:13.989
My nigga.

122
00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.950
Roll your window down. Start there.

123
00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:22.706
- Got to hear it, smell it, taste it.
- Right.

124
00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:26.418
- How's your <i>Español?
- Más o menos.</i>

125
00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:27.920
Learn that shit.

126
00:10:28.712 --> 00:10:30.380
That will get you killed.

127
00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:33.717
They plot all kinds of shit
behind your back.

128
00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:38.305
You gonna teach me that
old-school Rodney King shit?

129
00:10:38.514 --> 00:10:41.225
We don't roll like that no more.

130
00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:42.768
Now we use this.

131
00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:45.062
These niggas are too strong.

132
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.524
- Think I'm crazy?
- I don't know what to think.

133
00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:50.442
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

134
00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:52.236
Good.

135
00:10:56.907 --> 00:10:57.908
Good.

136
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.294
Been married long?

137
00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:11.255
- About a year.
- Yeah?

138
00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:14.341
- You got a kid?
- A girl, 9 months.

139
00:11:15.133 --> 00:11:18.262
I got four. Boys.

140
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.807
You need a son,
I'll hook your lady up. Can't miss.

141
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:27.145
Can we not talk
about my family, all right?

142
00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:28.355
I respect that.

143
00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:31.942
I'm married, I got my queen too.

144
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.570
I remember having a young bride.

145
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.031
You probably fuck her face-to-face,
don't you?

146
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.950
Let's not talk about her.

147
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:43.871
That's my point. You're so in love,
it's coming right out.

148
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.999
The day you bring
that here is the day...

149
00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.961
...you don't make it back.
Hide it deep inside of you.

150
00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.547
The maggots out here
will find it...

151
00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:56.383
...use it against you
and chew you up.

152
00:11:56.592 --> 00:11:58.886
Never wear the ring to work.

153
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.514
- I'm serious about that.
- Thanks.

154
00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:35.631
What's here?

155
00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.092
Transactions.

156
00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:45.057
You see that guy trying to act
like he's not slanging dope?

157
00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:48.352
- Yeah.
- That's my boy.

158
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.104
That's my boy, Neto.

159
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.565
Only 17, but he can kill.

160
00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.401
- Works for me.
- He's an informer?

161
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.695
Teammate. I got eyes everywhere.

162
00:12:58.904 --> 00:13:04.034
He gets to make some cash.
Lets me know when big things happen.

163
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.119
Big transactions.

164
00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:12.042
- You trust him?
- Damn right I do.

165
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.713
Sprung his mom from INS detention.
Here we go. Watch this.

166
00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:23.428
That's right. Come on down.

167
00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:26.890
Come on. Look at it. Sexy, ain't it?

168
00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.810
That's right.

169
00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:33.438
- See the hand-to-hand?
- I saw it.

170
00:13:33.689 --> 00:13:36.942
- When was your last felony stop?
- Two weeks ago.

171
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.235
You need practice.

172
00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.780
- College kids.
- They'll get an education today.

173
00:13:41.989 --> 00:13:45.117
I want them grabbing glass.
You take the back.

174
00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.078
Stay off of the Rover.

175
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:49.746
Let's go.

176
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:57.087
- You little fuckers.
- Run, baby, run.

177
00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.811
Police! Let's see your hands!

178
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.771
Put them up! Put them up!

179
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.524
Put your hands on the windshield!

180
00:14:17.733 --> 00:14:22.320
- Put your hands on the glass.
- Driver, put it in park!

181
00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:26.700
- It's a stick shift!
- Throw the keys out the window!

182
00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:29.286
Put your hands on your chest!

183
00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.415
All right, fork it over.

184
00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:34.791
- What?
- You know.

185
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.627
The marijuana. Give it to me!

186
00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.963
- Give it!
- Sorry, sir.

187
00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:44.968
- Shut up! Give me that pipe.
- My mom gave me that pipe.

188
00:14:45.177 --> 00:14:49.514
She can pick it up in jail.
Give me the cigarettes too.

189
00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:53.143
- Control your suspect!
- Palms on the glass!

190
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:58.356
Move the hands, I'll slap you!
Face against the glass! Right there!

191
00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.652
You know this is a gang neighborhood?

192
00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:06.656
- Yeah!
- Then don't come down here.

193
00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:11.536
I see you down here again,
I'll make you walk home.

194
00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:15.957
I'll let the homeboys run
a train on her. Know what that is?

195
00:15:16.291 --> 00:15:18.335
Yes, sir.

196
00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:23.256
All right, gentlemen.
Thanks for your cooperation.

197
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.885
Let's go. Safe your iron, son.

198
00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:29.888
Shit!

199
00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.192
I like that shit.

200
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.487
I like how you move.
You were trained well.

201
00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:50.700
Check that out. It's a bad dime.
See the hairs, undeveloped seeds.

202
00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.786
You see how immature it is.

203
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.413
That's classic Mexican garbage.

204
00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:58.625
Let me see. It's old.
Probably last year's.

205
00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:00.377
To be truly effective...

206
00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:05.715
...a good narcotics agent
must know and love narcotics.

207
00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:08.552
A good narcotics agent should have...

208
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.929
...narcotics in his blood.

209
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:15.267
- What, you gonna smoke that?
- No, you are.

210
00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:19.062
- Hell if I am!
- Yes.

211
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.981
- You're not?
- No.

212
00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.942
- Why? You a Mormon?
- I'm not losing my job.

213
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:25.503
- This is your job.
- I can't do that.

214
00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:27.070
- Smoke it.
- No.

215
00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:29.281
This ain't a test. Take a hit.

216
00:16:30.574 --> 00:16:34.411
Listen, I became a cop
to stop people from using...

217
00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:39.124
- That ain't cocaine. Take a hit.
- No, man.

218
00:16:42.878 --> 00:16:45.547
- Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, right.

219
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.466
If I was a dealer, you'd be dead!

220
00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:52.262
Turn shit down out here,
and your wife gets a flag.

221
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.014
What's wrong with you?

222
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.808
You know what?

223
00:16:57.017 --> 00:17:02.105
I don't want you in my unit.
Get the fuck out of my car, rookie.

224
00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:05.150
Poo butt-ass.

225
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:12.657
- What's the holdup?
- Move it!

226
00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:14.284
Give me that thing.

227
00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:17.287
I'll smoke it. Give it to me.

228
00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:21.541
You want me to, I'll smoke it.

229
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:38.141
Virgin lungs. Man up now.
Man up, nigga. Man up.

230
00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:39.684
Go ahead. Get it.

231
00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:43.396
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up and just wait!

232
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.741
- Man the fuck up! Finish that shit!
- Geronimo.

233
00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:01.831
Let's go, nigga. Let's go.

234
00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:56.386
Oh, shit!

235
00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:09.149
You okay, kid?

236
00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:14.154
That's a man size hit you took.
When's the last time you smoked weed?

237
00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.824
The last... Twelfth grade.

238
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:19.826
We were...

239
00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.663
- Well, we were...
- Smoking weed.

240
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.415
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:30.712
Left that out of your service jacket.

242
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.090
I know you got secrets.
Everybody got secrets.

243
00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:38.428
- Didn't know you liked it wet, though.
- What's wet?

244
00:19:38.678 --> 00:19:43.808
Butt-naked. III. Sherm. Dust.

245
00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:48.730
PCP. Primos. P-dog.

246
00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:51.024
That's what you had.

247
00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.693
You couldn't taste it?

248
00:19:55.987 --> 00:19:59.324
- I never done it.
- I haven't, but you have now.

249
00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.248
Shit!

250
00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:10.835
Shit. I'll get piss-tested,
and I'll get fired.

251
00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:14.089
The boss has our back.
We know before we piss.

252
00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:18.676
- Shit!
- Boom!

253
00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.345
Why did you do this?

254
00:20:20.553 --> 00:20:23.306
You're an adult.
Nobody made you smoke.

255
00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:26.559
You made a decision. Live with it.

256
00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:30.522
Not like I put a gun to your head.

257
00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:37.111
Man...

258
00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:55.088
- Oh, man, shit.
- Come on, get your shit together now.

259
00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.674
This is my dog's house.

260
00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:00.218
We'll see what he thinks of you.

261
00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:14.941
- Get your ass in here!
- Roger, what's up?

262
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.735
- How are they treating you?
- All right.

263
00:21:17.944 --> 00:21:20.822
- I didn't wake you up?
- I never sleep.

264
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.158
Right. This my new guy, Jake.

265
00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:24.951
Come on. Get in here.

266
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.705
Yeah. Time to get my swerve on here!

267
00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:31.332
- What you drinking?
- The best.

268
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.461
The best, I know. Best for the best.

269
00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:38.631
I heard about Vegas.
Got a green light on your ass.

270
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.383
No problem.

271
00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.136
Russians want you. I got your back.

272
00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:45.555
I know that. Thank you.

273
00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:51.352
Here. Get that medicine up in you.

274
00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:56.774
- Back to the world.
- Back to the world.

275
00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:03.948
Went and got yourself
a daisy-fresh rookie.

276
00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:15.376
He's high as a motherfucker.
What did you give him?

277
00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:18.171
- A little of Mexico's finest.
- Yeah.

278
00:22:23.218 --> 00:22:24.636
Garbage.

279
00:22:25.428 --> 00:22:28.014
- Where'd you grow up?
- North Hollywood.

280
00:22:28.223 --> 00:22:30.183
- What's your last name?
- Hoyt.

281
00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:34.479
Hoyt. Hoyt...

282
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:38.816
- Strong safety, North Hollywood High.
- Right.

283
00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:42.403
- How'd you know that?
- How did you?

284
00:22:42.946 --> 00:22:45.532
- I follow all the good players.
- No doubt.

285
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:49.619
Excuse me. Shit.

286
00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:54.165
- Strong safety, huh?
- It's me. What's up?

287
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.629
I can't do anything.
Clean up your own mess. Don't call me.

288
00:23:00.463 --> 00:23:04.884
Hey! Here's a joke, boy.

289
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:10.640
Man walks out of his house,
sees this snail lying on his porch.

290
00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:14.727
So he picks it up,
chucks it into the backyard.

291
00:23:14.936 --> 00:23:19.399
Snail bounces off a rock,
busts its shell up all to shit...

292
00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:21.317
...lands in the grass.

293
00:23:21.526 --> 00:23:24.070
Snail lies there dying.

294
00:23:26.864 --> 00:23:28.032
But...

295
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:31.411
...snail doesn't die.
Soon it can crawl again.

296
00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:34.372
And one day...

297
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.377
...snail heads back
to the front of the house.

298
00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:43.673
Finally, after about a year...

299
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:46.968
...the little guy crawls
back on the porch.

300
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:50.263
Right then the man walks
out of his house...

301
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.682
...sees this snail again.

302
00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:54.392
So he looks at it...

303
00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:56.436
...and he says:

304
00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:00.898
"The fuck's your problem?"

305
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.365
That's not funny.

306
00:24:09.574 --> 00:24:11.784
What you laughing for then?

307
00:24:11.993 --> 00:24:15.413
- I don't know, man. I...
- Hey!

308
00:24:15.622 --> 00:24:19.334
Figure that joke out,
you'll figure the streets out.

309
00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:23.796
Nothing to figure out.
It's senseless bullshit.

310
00:24:24.005 --> 00:24:28.426
- You know... I already figured it out.
- Really?

311
00:24:28.635 --> 00:24:32.221
- Yeah.
- You already figured the streets out?

312
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:36.267
Well, it's all about smiles and cries.

313
00:24:36.893 --> 00:24:39.937
- Put the drink down. What is that?
- Hold on!

314
00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:41.814
Hold on. Smiles and cries.

315
00:24:42.065 --> 00:24:45.568
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries. I hear you.

316
00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:50.239
Yeah, you gotta control
your smiles and cries...

317
00:24:50.448 --> 00:24:54.661
...because that's all you have,
and nobody can take that away.

318
00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:58.915
Oh, shit.

319
00:25:03.753 --> 00:25:08.925
What you think, dog? Think this
greenhorn can handle undercover?

320
00:25:10.051 --> 00:25:14.806
You were just like him.
Same silly-ass look and everything.

321
00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:16.933
Saving the goddamn world.

322
00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:21.646
Now that's some smiles
and cries for your ass!

323
00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:24.524
- That was you.
- Shit lasted a week.

324
00:25:25.358 --> 00:25:26.693
Gotta get back to it.

325
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:28.611
Thanks for the snort.

326
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.279
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

327
00:25:30.488 --> 00:25:32.615
Yes, sir. What you doing later?

328
00:25:32.824 --> 00:25:34.784
Stay home. Save some cheddar.

329
00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:39.956
My dream's less than a year away.
Philippine Islands, here I come.

330
00:25:40.164 --> 00:25:41.791
- Let me go too.
- You're invited.

331
00:25:57.849 --> 00:26:03.104
Hey. Open your eyes, man.
You'll feel a lot better.

332
00:26:07.567 --> 00:26:10.570
Boom! Come on, man. Sit your ass up.

333
00:26:17.034 --> 00:26:18.035
Who are you?

334
00:26:20.538 --> 00:26:23.082
I'm the Zig-Zag man. Who are you?

335
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:26.461
- I'm a cop. Watch out!
- Don't shoot nobody.

336
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:29.088
Get that beer in you for ballast.

337
00:26:29.672 --> 00:26:33.050
- No, man.
- Get it in you. You'll feel better.

338
00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:51.778
Stop the car!

339
00:26:51.986 --> 00:26:53.988
Stop the car! I saw something!

340
00:26:54.197 --> 00:26:55.615
- Just relax.
- Stop!

341
00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:58.785
All right! Hold the fuck on... Hey!

342
00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:07.710
Fuck me, man! Shit.

343
00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:12.882
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

344
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.010
- I'm gonna fuck you too, cop!
- Get the...

345
00:27:49.794 --> 00:27:52.338
We didn't do shit! Bitch is crazy!

346
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:59.345
Roll over, man. Roll the fuck over!

347
00:28:00.054 --> 00:28:01.347
Fucking ass prick!

348
00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.103
My nigga!

349
00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:10.189
Go ahead, cowboy,
you got mad squabbles.

350
00:28:11.274 --> 00:28:14.485
- Thanks for the help.
- You should've shot them.

351
00:28:14.861 --> 00:28:16.028
What's happening?

352
00:28:16.237 --> 00:28:18.614
- You're dead!
- Okay! Wait! Hold it!

353
00:28:18.823 --> 00:28:20.741
- You too, white boy!
- Okay...

354
00:28:20.992 --> 00:28:24.203
- My cousins will blast you fools!
- Calm down.

355
00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:26.747
- Calm down. You okay?
- No, I'm not!

356
00:28:26.956 --> 00:28:28.958
- Look at my nose!
- I see it.

357
00:28:29.166 --> 00:28:32.962
Put ice on it. You'll be fine.
What're you doing here?

358
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.715
- I was just...
- They probably got AIDS.

359
00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:37.508
Why you not at school?

360
00:28:37.717 --> 00:28:40.011
I was going to a ditch party and...

361
00:28:40.219 --> 00:28:42.680
You almost became the ditch party.

362
00:28:42.889 --> 00:28:45.516
- Where your cousins from?
- Hillside <i>Trece!</i>

363
00:28:45.725 --> 00:28:49.478
- Remember that!
- Tell your cousins to get your back.

364
00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:51.856
Grab your bag and go home now.

365
00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:55.484
- No! I need a statement...
- Don't need no statement.

366
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:58.821
- They'll fuck you up.
- We gonna let them go?

367
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.407
You wanna beat them up, go ahead.

368
00:29:01.657 --> 00:29:05.661
I got a punching bag at home.
They should be off the streets.

369
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:07.538
You hear that?

370
00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:11.542
- Wanna go home or to jail?
- What you think?

371
00:29:13.544 --> 00:29:16.547
Got room at the booty house.
You been there?

372
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:21.177
- You'll grab your ankles.
- Suck my dick!

373
00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:24.388
- I know people.
- That's how it starts.

374
00:29:24.639 --> 00:29:26.933
What about you? What you got?

375
00:29:27.141 --> 00:29:28.726
- Got nothing?
- No.

376
00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:30.269
- You sure?
- Yeah.

377
00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:33.689
- Where's your horn?
- Got none.

378
00:29:36.734 --> 00:29:38.527
You got money, though.

379
00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:42.406
You lied to me!

380
00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:45.743
Lucky I don't make you eat that.

381
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:50.581
Stand up, you. Stand the fuck up!

382
00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.631
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?

383
00:30:06.472 --> 00:30:09.558
Turn around, sucker. Turn around.

384
00:30:11.143 --> 00:30:13.104
So you like raping girls?

385
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:16.816
- Like to rape girls?
- No, man.

386
00:30:17.066 --> 00:30:19.110
- That's what you like?
- No...

387
00:30:20.695 --> 00:30:22.780
That what you like? Don't lie.

388
00:30:22.989 --> 00:30:26.450
Told me to suck your dick.
Is that what you said?

389
00:30:28.285 --> 00:30:29.453
Look at me.

390
00:30:30.454 --> 00:30:33.457
You wanted me
to suck your dick, right?

391
00:30:33.666 --> 00:30:35.876
Isn't that what you said?

392
00:30:36.085 --> 00:30:39.422
Didn't you say suck it?
Don't lie. Am I a liar?

393
00:30:39.672 --> 00:30:40.965
You didn't say that?

394
00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:44.802
That's not what you said?
So I'm lying?

395
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:48.305
- No, please!
- Where is it? I can't find it.

396
00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:50.808
Pull your pants down.

397
00:30:54.478 --> 00:30:57.732
Which nut you want?
I'll leave you one.

398
00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:01.902
Your choice. Just make a decision.

399
00:31:02.528 --> 00:31:06.240
All right.
Put your hands on your head.

400
00:31:08.034 --> 00:31:12.121
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

401
00:31:16.667 --> 00:31:18.461
Lucky I got other business.

402
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:24.216
I'd cut your fucking dick off
and stick it up your funky ass. Bitch.

403
00:31:24.425 --> 00:31:28.471
Damn! I'm thirsty.
I want a beer. What about you?

404
00:31:28.846 --> 00:31:30.347
You want a beer?

405
00:31:34.518 --> 00:31:36.854
I'm gonna leave you three to it.

406
00:31:43.027 --> 00:31:44.904
Pussy-ass bitch!

407
00:31:45.154 --> 00:31:47.865
I see you again, I'll fuck you up!

408
00:31:48.657 --> 00:31:50.534
You won't see shit coming!

409
00:31:50.743 --> 00:31:54.246
I'll dent your mouth,
I'll crack your head open.

410
00:31:54.455 --> 00:31:56.165
You fucking pig! Come on!

411
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.846
- That girl's 14.
- She all woman, though.

412
00:32:11.055 --> 00:32:14.767
You tax that ass for days, man!
Keep walking, bitch!

413
00:32:25.903 --> 00:32:27.196
You want a beer?

414
00:32:28.489 --> 00:32:32.201
- No, I don't want a beer, man.
- No? You mad?

415
00:32:44.588 --> 00:32:46.549
Want to book that $60, huh?

416
00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:49.426
Here, go ahead, book it into evidence.

417
00:32:49.927 --> 00:32:52.221
Where the suspects? Go get them.

418
00:32:52.388 --> 00:32:54.098
You let them go.

419
00:32:54.306 --> 00:32:55.891
- I let them go?
- You did.

420
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.270
You want to run and gun,
stay in Patrol.

421
00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.397
This is Investigations.

422
00:33:01.647 --> 00:33:03.440
Garbage men handle garbage.

423
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:06.402
Professional anglers
go after the big fish.

424
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.113
Chasing them crackhead
motherfuckers...

425
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:11.991
- They'd have killed you.
- They belong in jail.

426
00:33:12.241 --> 00:33:14.785
Why? They got beaten,
lost their money.

427
00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:18.455
Hillside's <i>éses</i> will smoke them.
What more you want?

428
00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.666
- I want justice.
- That's not justice?

429
00:33:21.125 --> 00:33:22.835
- That's street justice.
- So?

430
00:33:23.043 --> 00:33:25.379
- Let them kill each other?
- God willing.

431
00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:27.965
Fuck them!
Everybody looking like them.

432
00:33:28.174 --> 00:33:30.259
Reality is, the good guys...

433
00:33:30.426 --> 00:33:33.637
...they die first.
The school kids and moms...

434
00:33:33.888 --> 00:33:37.266
...family men, don't want to catch
any bullets.

435
00:33:37.433 --> 00:33:41.020
To protect the sheep,
you got to catch the wolf.

436
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:44.106
It takes a wolf to catch a wolf,
understand?

437
00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:45.357
What?

438
00:33:45.566 --> 00:33:48.611
- Protect the sheep by killing wolves.
- I heard you.

439
00:33:48.819 --> 00:33:51.614
- You didn't hear me.
- All right. Whatever.

440
00:33:51.822 --> 00:33:53.574
Whatever the fuck-ever!

441
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.174
Do you ever look anybody up?
You seem busy keeping people out.

442
00:34:10.382 --> 00:34:12.009
You don't know shit!

443
00:34:12.218 --> 00:34:15.721
Shit, they build jails because of me!

444
00:34:16.013 --> 00:34:20.142
Judges gave over 15,000 man-years
of incarceration time...

445
00:34:20.351 --> 00:34:23.896
...based on my cases.
My record speaks for itself.

446
00:34:24.104 --> 00:34:26.023
How many felons have you got?

447
00:34:28.317 --> 00:34:29.568
I rest my case.

448
00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:40.329
- I'm not smoking crack, all right?
- I'm glad. Put it in the glove box.

449
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:42.665
Put the $60 in there too.

450
00:34:42.873 --> 00:34:47.253
That'll come in handy.
We'll use it like a credit card.

451
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.719
Hey.

452
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.223
No matter what I say,
you did the right thing.

453
00:35:01.642 --> 00:35:05.562
Reminds me when I was
chasing down bad guys.

454
00:35:05.771 --> 00:35:08.399
Pretty amazing shit you did
back there.

455
00:35:10.401 --> 00:35:11.694
Thanks.

456
00:35:12.278 --> 00:35:15.781
I noticed you applied that chokehold
though, huh?

457
00:35:16.865 --> 00:35:18.659
That's a no-no procedure.

458
00:35:20.536 --> 00:35:24.373
- I was getting my ass kicked.
- You did what you had to do.

459
00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:27.209
You did what you had to do.

460
00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:29.962
That's right.

461
00:35:33.382 --> 00:35:35.884
What a wolf does. You a wolf?

462
00:35:36.969 --> 00:35:39.763
Come on, wolf! Come on, dog!

463
00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:45.894
No, I said a wolf,
not a rooster, a wolf.

464
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.319
- That's a rooster, give me a wolf!
- Give me a beer!

465
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:55.779
There you go! That's my nigga.

466
00:35:57.406 --> 00:35:59.408
You got the magic eye, Hoyt.

467
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:02.661
You have the magic eye.

468
00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:04.913
You up your street IQ...

469
00:36:05.122 --> 00:36:07.708
...you'll do some damage,
I guarantee.

470
00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:10.836
Crime fighter.

471
00:36:53.837 --> 00:36:55.506
- What you need?
- Crack.

472
00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:58.634
- Uh, 20 bucks...
- Crack?

473
00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:05.057
Smell like bacon!
Do I look like a sucker to you, nigga?

474
00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:07.726
Fuck you, rookie!

475
00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:13.899
Go fetch, dog.

476
00:37:14.316 --> 00:37:15.984
You want me to...

477
00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:20.864
Oh, come on, man, it's...

478
00:37:27.204 --> 00:37:29.540
Give me a break! Hey, you! Slow up!

479
00:37:35.003 --> 00:37:36.130
Come on, stop!

480
00:37:36.338 --> 00:37:40.050
Police officer! Police officer! Stop!
Come on, man!

481
00:37:40.259 --> 00:37:41.760
Give me a break! Shit!

482
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:46.056
Get out! Get out of here
or I call police.

483
00:37:47.224 --> 00:37:51.061
Police officer, ma'am, calm down.
I said stop! Stop!

484
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.439
Get the fuck off me. Fuck off.

485
00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:02.739
You're making this so much harder!
Just calm down!

486
00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:11.457
You love this shit, huh?

487
00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:14.168
Hey, man, hey!

488
00:38:14.877 --> 00:38:15.878
Pick him up!

489
00:38:16.086 --> 00:38:19.339
Civil rights
violating motherfuckers!

490
00:38:19.548 --> 00:38:20.591
Fuck!

491
00:38:21.383 --> 00:38:24.720
- Watch the fucking legs, man!
- Pick his legs up.

492
00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:28.974
Ain't got nothing better to do
than fuck with me, man? Shit!

493
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:33.812
Who you working for?

494
00:38:34.062 --> 00:38:36.815
I ain't work for nobody!
I'm on disability!

495
00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:38.942
Shit! You know you cracking.

496
00:38:39.151 --> 00:38:40.944
I don't sell no more.

497
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.489
- No rocks?
- No rocks.

498
00:38:44.281 --> 00:38:46.617
- But I found this.
- No, you don't.

499
00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:49.995
That motherfucker planted
that shit on me.

500
00:38:50.204 --> 00:38:53.415
Put me in the front seat,
I'll whup his ass!

501
00:38:55.876 --> 00:38:57.294
Who you working for?

502
00:38:57.503 --> 00:39:01.256
Told you I don't work for nobody, man!

503
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.883
Where the rocks?

504
00:39:03.342 --> 00:39:05.636
I got nothing on me.
I gave it up.

505
00:39:09.473 --> 00:39:10.474
Where the rocks?

506
00:39:12.476 --> 00:39:13.644
Open your mouth.

507
00:39:14.102 --> 00:39:15.354
You a doctor now?

508
00:39:15.604 --> 00:39:17.147
A dentist. Open it.

509
00:39:18.315 --> 00:39:19.650
Lift up your tongue.

510
00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:24.821
Your partner already searched me.
I'm straight.

511
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.657
Yeah, okay.

512
00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:29.159
You got a pen, got a writing pen?

513
00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:32.829
Didn't see the
motherfucker coming!

514
00:39:34.498 --> 00:39:35.832
Nothing in there?

515
00:39:38.669 --> 00:39:40.128
Nothing, man!

516
00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:41.964
Ain't got nothing, huh?

517
00:39:44.841 --> 00:39:46.343
God!

518
00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:49.221
- Damn!
- Now what is that?

519
00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:52.140
- Crack, man!
- Right. Jimmy crack corn.

520
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:54.643
One, two, three, four, five, six.

521
00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.229
Oh, you federally fucked now.

522
00:39:57.688 --> 00:40:00.524
You got crack and a gun.

523
00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:04.486
With your record you'll get
10 years per bullet, you know?

524
00:40:04.695 --> 00:40:06.238
Give me a name, now.

525
00:40:06.947 --> 00:40:10.200
- You know I ain't no snitch!
- I know you ain't.

526
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:12.244
Give me a name.

527
00:40:13.287 --> 00:40:14.997
- Twenty. A name!
- Fuck!

528
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:18.000
That's 30 years!

529
00:40:18.292 --> 00:40:20.669
You want to go to jail or go home?

530
00:40:21.712 --> 00:40:23.171
- He in County.
- Who?

531
00:40:23.964 --> 00:40:27.676
This nigga named Sandman.
That's all I know! Shit!

532
00:40:27.926 --> 00:40:29.678
- Sandman?
- Sandman.

533
00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:31.388
See how easy it was?

534
00:40:35.183 --> 00:40:37.769
- Unhook him.
- Sick of this shit, man!

535
00:40:37.978 --> 00:40:39.521
Want the evidence?

536
00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:41.857
- Fuck that, man.
- My nigga.

537
00:40:56.997 --> 00:40:58.248
<i>- It’s Bob.</i>
- Hello.

538
00:40:58.457 --> 00:41:00.125
<i>- How's it going?</i>
- It's Alonzo.

539
00:41:00.334 --> 00:41:01.960
- Got your gang book?
<i>- Why?</i>

540
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:06.214
I need a res on a Sandman.
He may be in custody.

541
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:08.717
<i>- Hold on. I'll check.</i>
- No problem.

542
00:41:08.884 --> 00:41:11.887
That doesn't fly anymore.
Shoving a pen down.

543
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:14.431
- What if he complains?
- To who?

544
00:41:14.723 --> 00:41:19.227
<i>23130, 113th Street.
Kevin Miller, a.k.a. Sandman. Got it?</i>

545
00:41:19.436 --> 00:41:21.063
- I like my badge.
- I know where it is.

546
00:41:21.271 --> 00:41:24.775
- Out there by Imperial Courts?
<i>- Exactly, uh-huh.</i>

547
00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:26.818
- Thanks a lot.
<i>- No problem.</i>

548
00:41:29.529 --> 00:41:32.282
- We go after Sandman?
- We go after him.

549
00:42:20.831 --> 00:42:22.332
Opening a Circuit City?

550
00:42:22.541 --> 00:42:24.960
No, unclaimed shit from Property.

551
00:42:25.168 --> 00:42:28.296
Hand it out to my Cl's, witnesses,
victims.

552
00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:31.675
Try to help out their families.
Put this on.

553
00:42:33.218 --> 00:42:34.678
Come on, let's go.

554
00:42:35.178 --> 00:42:40.517
Intel says she lives here alone.
She got two female juveniles...

555
00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:42.477
...possibly a male juvenile.

556
00:42:42.686 --> 00:42:46.106
- If he's not here, why are we?
- To serve this warrant.

557
00:42:46.356 --> 00:42:49.943
- We can't do that.
- Yes, we can. We the police.

558
00:42:50.152 --> 00:42:52.529
- Why not get a real warrant?
- We trying to get shit done.

559
00:42:52.738 --> 00:42:55.490
Stand over there
and don't get me killed.

560
00:42:58.702 --> 00:43:01.997
- Police, we got a search warrant!
- L.A.P.D., open up!

561
00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:05.208
Kevin ain't here!

562
00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:07.669
Just open the door!

563
00:43:07.878 --> 00:43:09.421
Kevin ain't here!

564
00:43:09.629 --> 00:43:12.924
- Open the door, ma'am!
- He ain't even here!

565
00:43:13.717 --> 00:43:16.052
I said Kevin ain't even over here!

566
00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:18.513
We got a search warrant.
Open up.

567
00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:20.682
Ain't nobody here!

568
00:43:21.183 --> 00:43:23.852
Get your big ass down!
Right down! Down!

569
00:43:24.102 --> 00:43:26.897
Don't move, spread them out!
Don't move!

570
00:43:27.147 --> 00:43:30.233
Anybody in the house?
Is anybody in the house?!

571
00:43:30.442 --> 00:43:33.195
My nephew, Dimitri! In the bedroom!

572
00:43:33.445 --> 00:43:37.449
Okay. I'm gonna clear the house,
check it for weapons.

573
00:43:46.792 --> 00:43:48.293
Kitchen's clear!

574
00:43:58.887 --> 00:44:00.096
- Dimitri?
- Yeah?

575
00:44:00.764 --> 00:44:02.808
Put your hands up, son.

576
00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:04.935
- Anybody else?
- No.

577
00:44:05.143 --> 00:44:06.812
- You sure?
- Yeah.

578
00:44:07.521 --> 00:44:11.441
Okay, just stay right there.
Don't move! Don't you move.

579
00:44:12.025 --> 00:44:15.070
Stand up. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

580
00:44:15.278 --> 00:44:18.740
Sit down and place them
on your knees.

581
00:44:18.949 --> 00:44:21.117
Sit down. We're the good guys.

582
00:44:21.618 --> 00:44:25.038
Just sit down right over there
next to your auntie.

583
00:44:25.247 --> 00:44:26.540
Right over there.

584
00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:29.668
House is Code-4.
I'm starting the search.

585
00:44:42.222 --> 00:44:44.641
- I wanna see that warrant.
- The what?

586
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.601
The warrant. I need a copy.

587
00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.688
My partner has it.
He'll be out soon.

588
00:44:51.648 --> 00:44:53.024
Where's your backup?

589
00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:57.988
Just be quiet until we're through
with our investigation.

590
00:44:58.196 --> 00:45:01.157
- You got the gun, don't you?
- That's right.

591
00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:04.244
Punk-ass, bitch-ass, crooked-ass cop!

592
00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:06.872
- Okay.
- You a rookie.

593
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:09.875
Give me a break, okay?

594
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:18.383
How you doing over there?
You cool? Come on.

595
00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.720
Don't worry about it, you're cool.

596
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.346
Just stay cool.

597
00:45:24.389 --> 00:45:25.473
All right.

598
00:45:30.186 --> 00:45:33.899
- Ma'am, please sit down.
- You act like you pay the rent!

599
00:45:34.107 --> 00:45:35.859
- Sit down!
- You all stink!

600
00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:38.612
You gotta get drunk to come
up here!

601
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.780
- Sit down now!
- Y'all stink!

602
00:45:41.114 --> 00:45:43.241
You're gonna shoot me, boss?

603
00:45:45.911 --> 00:45:49.122
Close your eyes.
This punk cop is gonna shoot me!

604
00:45:49.331 --> 00:45:51.374
- Sit down, right now!
- Okay.

605
00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:53.293
Okay! Everything is fine.

606
00:45:53.627 --> 00:45:55.295
We made a mistake.

607
00:45:56.671 --> 00:46:00.592
Didn't find a damn thing.
I'm very sorry.

608
00:46:01.009 --> 00:46:03.303
Thanks for your cooperation.
Let's go.

609
00:46:03.637 --> 00:46:05.680
- Show me that warrant.
- What?

610
00:46:05.889 --> 00:46:08.767
I want to see that goddamn warrant!

611
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.064
Here you go. Let's go!

612
00:46:18.568 --> 00:46:19.778
Shit!

613
00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:24.449
Motherfuckers!

614
00:46:24.908 --> 00:46:28.244
Hey, jackers! Give me my money back.

615
00:46:28.453 --> 00:46:31.539
You ain't no police!
Give me my money back!

616
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:36.044
Jackers, why you all standing
over there?! Blast them fools!

617
00:46:36.252 --> 00:46:39.047
You ain't no police!

618
00:46:39.214 --> 00:46:41.174
I want my money back!

619
00:46:41.383 --> 00:46:43.093
Start, you motherfucker!

620
00:46:43.551 --> 00:46:44.844
Fuck! Gun!

621
00:46:45.053 --> 00:46:47.681
- Just get out of here!
- Stay in the car!

622
00:46:52.394 --> 00:46:54.104
Yeah, motherfuckers!

623
00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:19.921
That was not cool, all right?
That was not cool at all!

624
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.340
Opening fire in a neighborhood.

625
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:26.761
Where was the Sandman?
What were you doing back there?

626
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:32.267
Checking for narcotics activity.
Drugs, guns, baggies, you know?

627
00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:34.894
- Yeah, cash!
- Speak on it, son.

628
00:47:35.103 --> 00:47:37.731
- She's screaming about money...
- Bullshit.

629
00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:40.525
- Screaming about having us killed!
- Whatever.

630
00:47:40.734 --> 00:47:45.780
I'll be on the 6:00 news
in handcuffs because of you.

631
00:47:45.989 --> 00:47:49.409
With the scandals,
it is open season on misconduct.

632
00:47:49.617 --> 00:47:52.328
- They'll nail us to the wall.
- Pull over.

633
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:54.914
- Pull over.
- Here?

634
00:47:55.165 --> 00:47:56.958
- Yeah, pull over.
- Shit!

635
00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:17.562
What?

636
00:48:19.898 --> 00:48:20.899
Listen.

637
00:48:21.858 --> 00:48:24.486
You're in a privileged position
to learn.

638
00:48:24.694 --> 00:48:26.738
Keep your mouth shut, eyes open.

639
00:48:26.946 --> 00:48:30.158
Want to do some good,
this is the place to learn.

640
00:48:30.533 --> 00:48:34.496
You can't take it, maybe you
should go back to your division.

641
00:48:34.746 --> 00:48:39.209
Get a nice job lighting flares
or measuring car wrecks.

642
00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:43.421
You got to decide
whether you're a wolf...

643
00:48:44.547 --> 00:48:46.007
...or a sheep.

644
00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:53.056
Get your ink...

645
00:48:56.726 --> 00:48:58.478
...or go give him a hand.

646
00:49:29.092 --> 00:49:31.719
What are we doing here?
We'll get killed.

647
00:49:31.928 --> 00:49:35.557
- You know about this place?
- It's the Jungle, right?

648
00:49:35.765 --> 00:49:38.893
They say don't come with anything
less than a platoon.

649
00:49:48.862 --> 00:49:50.822
This is the heart of it.

650
00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:53.324
Jungle. Damu headquarters.

651
00:49:54.576 --> 00:49:55.994
Stoners.

652
00:49:56.244 --> 00:49:59.080
A lot of murder investigations
lead here.

653
00:49:59.455 --> 00:50:01.583
One way in, one way out.

654
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.377
Thought we were going to eat.

655
00:50:04.752 --> 00:50:08.882
Don't ever come here without me.
I'm serious. For your safety.

656
00:50:14.637 --> 00:50:17.640
- How'd you get a golden pass?
- I treat them fair.

657
00:50:18.016 --> 00:50:21.477
They know if they cross the line,
I tax that ass.

658
00:50:35.158 --> 00:50:36.784
What's that, up there?

659
00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.997
They flipping pigeons
to signal I'm here.

660
00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:10.860
- What's up, Bone?
- What's up?

661
00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:12.946
- What's up?
- It's all good.

662
00:51:13.196 --> 00:51:16.574
I appreciate what you did
for my nephew.

663
00:51:16.824 --> 00:51:18.493
For sure. For sure.

664
00:51:20.828 --> 00:51:22.247
You better call me.

665
00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:29.087
I'm sick of it.
I can't stand him!

666
00:51:29.462 --> 00:51:32.924
- Who are they?
- Nobody. I got them under my thumb.

667
00:51:33.174 --> 00:51:37.220
- What's up, Alonzo?
- All right, Spider. What's happening?

668
00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:40.848
Hey, what's up, girl? Look at you.
Go ahead.

669
00:51:41.057 --> 00:51:43.351
All that jelly and no toast.

670
00:51:43.726 --> 00:51:47.188
- Who lives here?
- Just one of my lovelies.

671
00:51:47.397 --> 00:51:50.066
A loving touch, you know?
Don't worry.

672
00:52:15.383 --> 00:52:17.427
New guy, Jake.

673
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:19.512
- Hi.
- Jake.

674
00:52:19.762 --> 00:52:22.807
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to my house.

675
00:52:23.057 --> 00:52:26.561
- Give him some food. Take care of him.
- Of course.

676
00:52:29.397 --> 00:52:33.109
- Of course. How are you?
- Good, good.

677
00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:38.990
I have cable.
You watch whatever you want, okay?

678
00:52:39.449 --> 00:52:41.909
- Thanks.
- This is your house.

679
00:52:43.578 --> 00:52:45.038
I'll be right back.

680
00:52:54.797 --> 00:52:57.008
- How you doing?
- Fine.

681
00:52:58.634 --> 00:52:59.927
Okay.

682
00:53:03.431 --> 00:53:07.935
Now, this is all El Salvadorian food.

683
00:53:08.102 --> 00:53:09.979
Thank you. It looks great.

684
00:53:13.441 --> 00:53:14.442
I have to go.

685
00:53:14.984 --> 00:53:17.362
Yeah, all right.

686
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:05.243
Let's go.
We got a meeting in 15 minutes.

687
00:54:05.868 --> 00:54:08.413
- I just need to...
- Forget it. Let's go.

688
00:54:09.664 --> 00:54:11.040
I'll see you, buddy.

689
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:41.320
You okay?

690
00:54:47.535 --> 00:54:49.370
Okay.

691
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:20.943
Here, use this.

692
00:55:22.195 --> 00:55:23.988
- Who's here?
- L.A.P.D.'s finest.

693
00:55:24.197 --> 00:55:26.574
Don't speak till you're spoken to.

694
00:55:26.824 --> 00:55:27.867
Come on.

695
00:55:45.343 --> 00:55:46.344
Good to see you.

696
00:55:46.594 --> 00:55:50.681
That's my new guy. Jake Hoyt.
Captain Lou Jacobs.

697
00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:53.518
Need to talk to the feds,
go to him first.

698
00:55:53.768 --> 00:55:55.603
He'll take your back for you.

699
00:55:55.853 --> 00:55:58.606
Stan Gursky,
he runs the DA. shooting team.

700
00:55:58.814 --> 00:56:01.442
Think about him
before you shoot someone.

701
00:56:01.651 --> 00:56:04.987
If you're wrong,
he'll use your nuts for dice.

702
00:56:05.196 --> 00:56:08.324
Right here,
Detective Doug Rosselli...

703
00:56:08.533 --> 00:56:12.328
...handles theft cases
for the French-poodle crowd.

704
00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.622
He's a good man.

705
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:17.166
- Pleased to meet you.
- Good man.

706
00:56:18.167 --> 00:56:19.794
- Should I...?
- Shoo.

707
00:56:20.002 --> 00:56:22.296
Get yourself a steak or something.

708
00:56:23.422 --> 00:56:25.216
All right, gents.

709
00:56:26.342 --> 00:56:30.221
I don't know why I'm meeting you.
I don't talk to dead men.

710
00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:32.473
I ain't dead yet.

711
00:56:32.723 --> 00:56:35.434
Fucking prick. Excuse me.

712
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.313
Why the long face, Doug?

713
00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:43.526
- Feds seize your house or something?
- Fuck yourself.

714
00:56:44.235 --> 00:56:45.903
Tell him the story.

715
00:56:46.654 --> 00:56:48.155
Come on, tell the story.

716
00:56:48.364 --> 00:56:52.159
- If it's so funny, you tell him.
- It's your story.

717
00:56:53.578 --> 00:56:54.912
Asshole.

718
00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.585
All right.
There's a serial burglar.

719
00:57:02.795 --> 00:57:05.172
Chased him for a year.
A real slickster.

720
00:57:05.381 --> 00:57:07.967
Captain's riding my ass
the whole time.

721
00:57:08.426 --> 00:57:11.178
- Sentencing was today.
- Judge is female.

722
00:57:11.429 --> 00:57:13.055
That's right. Landers.

723
00:57:13.264 --> 00:57:15.683
I know Landers. She's a sharp lady.

724
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:20.104
No?

725
00:57:20.354 --> 00:57:25.109
Guy gets ahold of some peanut butter,
packs his ass-crack with it.

726
00:57:26.027 --> 00:57:30.239
He's standing before the bench,
waiting to give his statement.

727
00:57:30.448 --> 00:57:34.952
Shoves his hand down his pants,
comes out with extra-chunky Jif.

728
00:57:38.247 --> 00:57:40.207
Bailiffs won't come near him.

729
00:57:44.462 --> 00:57:47.798
Now he looks the judge
right in the eyes...

730
00:57:48.007 --> 00:57:50.259
...and licks his fingers clean.

731
00:57:52.428 --> 00:57:53.804
Holy shit.

732
00:57:54.555 --> 00:57:56.474
So the judge says:

733
00:57:56.724 --> 00:57:59.477
"This man's insane.
He can't go to prison."

734
00:57:59.727 --> 00:58:02.730
- Sends him to Psychiatric.
- She fell for it.

735
00:58:02.897 --> 00:58:04.774
Yeah! She's so fucking smart.

736
00:58:05.149 --> 00:58:09.612
By the time she found out,
the guy's already been transferred.

737
00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:17.912
- Proceedings closed.
- Yeah, closed.

738
00:58:18.329 --> 00:58:21.540
He'll do six months
in the puzzle factory...

739
00:58:21.791 --> 00:58:23.250
...and they'll let him go.

740
00:58:23.459 --> 00:58:25.628
Never, ever do a day in prison.

741
00:58:26.045 --> 00:58:29.965
Give him credit. He worked the system,
deserves his freedom.

742
00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:32.259
Yeah? Think so?

743
00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:33.928
Or not.

744
00:58:35.513 --> 00:58:36.972
I'll tell you what.

745
00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.017
I'll find this guy on the street...

746
00:58:40.559 --> 00:58:42.019
...and I'll do him.

747
00:58:46.691 --> 00:58:49.193
Better take his bullets away,
Stan.

748
00:58:50.152 --> 00:58:51.612
Shit!

749
00:58:53.656 --> 00:58:58.411
Alonzo, heard you had an expensive
weekend in Vegas.

750
00:58:59.286 --> 00:59:02.873
How did you ever screw up so bad?

751
00:59:03.082 --> 00:59:06.127
It's nothing.
I didn't know. It's not my town.

752
00:59:06.335 --> 00:59:08.879
The Russians don't care
if you're a cop.

753
00:59:09.505 --> 00:59:12.550
They'll whack you.
You ought to get on a plane.

754
00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.968
Why?

755
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:16.512
- It's an easy fix.
- How?

756
00:59:16.721 --> 00:59:19.640
- I'll just cash in an account.
- Oh, yeah?

757
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:22.727
- Whose?
- One of my old ones. My first one.

758
00:59:24.228 --> 00:59:26.647
The guy's a high-security risk.

759
00:59:26.856 --> 00:59:30.860
If I'm not around, who will keep him off
the radar? I'm just taxing him, that's all.

760
00:59:33.529 --> 00:59:34.529
Okay?

761
00:59:42.371 --> 00:59:43.914
It's your call.

762
00:59:45.082 --> 00:59:47.001
Don't dick this up.

763
00:59:47.251 --> 00:59:51.505
I do not want to see you
on the front page like the others.

764
00:59:52.548 --> 00:59:54.049
Yeah, I understand.

765
00:59:55.426 --> 00:59:56.427
Who's driving?

766
00:59:57.553 --> 01:00:00.598
- Me. Gray Mercedes.
- Okay.

767
01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:05.352
- Get the car.
- All right, all right.

768
01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:09.940
Black Monte Carlo there,
back windows shot out.

769
01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:26.874
It's me.
Listen, we got the green light.

770
01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:30.544
Fax a copy
of the warrant to the clerk.

771
01:00:30.753 --> 01:00:35.424
Get it signed by the judge, and I want
you and Paul to bring it to me.

772
01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:39.094
Tell Jeff to pick up some tools.
Picks and shovels.

773
01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:43.599
Make sure he signs them out
from maintenance. Copy?

774
01:00:44.183 --> 01:00:46.602
That's right. Hurry up! Later.

775
01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.981
So how much cash was in that jacket?

776
01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:53.442
Forty G's.

777
01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:55.611
What's that for?

778
01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.781
- Really want to know?
- Yes, I do.

779
01:00:59.949 --> 01:01:04.078
Nothing's free in this world.
Not even arrest warrants.

780
01:01:05.246 --> 01:01:07.414
Shit, man, I didn't want to know.

781
01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:21.554
Check this out.
Nice suit, Mark.

782
01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:24.723
- Beautiful suit.
- Yeah, fuck you guys!

783
01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.451
All right. Nice, nice.

784
01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:46.453
What's up, Alonzo?

785
01:01:46.996 --> 01:01:49.498
- The picks and shovels?
- In the trunk.

786
01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:51.000
Digging a ditch?

787
01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:55.796
No, you are.
Nice suit you got on there.

788
01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:57.840
That's what I said.

789
01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:01.343
- What up, killer?
- What's up with you?

790
01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:04.972
- Heard you ran into trouble.
- It's all good.

791
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.516
Don't worry, everything's fine.

792
01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:11.395
Shit, if we can get away with it,
I'm with you.

793
01:02:12.313 --> 01:02:16.901
- Who the fuck is this?
- Jake Hoyt. It's my first day.

794
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:19.653
You're a long way from Starbucks.

795
01:02:22.031 --> 01:02:25.910
- Why the fuck is he here?
- Gotta get his cherry popped.

796
01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:28.037
Stay the fuck out of my way.

797
01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:31.123
This is for the big dogs. Feel me?

798
01:02:31.707 --> 01:02:35.419
Here it is, all legit,
signed by the judge, okay?

799
01:02:35.628 --> 01:02:38.005
Thanks to the Sandman.
Now listen.

800
01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:39.798
Safety is first.

801
01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:42.593
He gives us shit,
we give him lead.

802
01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:46.180
Let's do this right
so we can all go home.

803
01:02:47.056 --> 01:02:49.183
Time to punch in, ladies.

804
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:39.316
Freeze! On the floor!

805
01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:42.069
- Down!
- What are you clowns doing?

806
01:03:42.236 --> 01:03:44.613
Hey, new guy, watch him!

807
01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:48.659
- I'm on him.
- You know what you're doing?

808
01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.119
Drop your gun!

809
01:03:50.369 --> 01:03:53.080
Five. Four. Three.

810
01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:56.500
Boom!

811
01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:00.838
Give me a reason.

812
01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.882
Alonzo's gonna have your ass.

813
01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:06.010
What's up, Roger?

814
01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:10.639
- What's going down, brother?
- Oh, it's all good, baby.

815
01:04:13.017 --> 01:04:14.810
It's all good.

816
01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:19.815
That's for you.

817
01:04:22.026 --> 01:04:25.195
What am I supposed to do with
this? Wipe my ass?

818
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:30.034
Bad news, dog.

819
01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:33.370
Gimme some of that $300-a-glass shit.

820
01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.748
Please.

821
01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:39.251
Had lunch with the wise men.

822
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.545
You gotta render unto Caesar.

823
01:04:41.754 --> 01:04:45.174
- Those vampires want my pension.
- No, no.

824
01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:51.930
Just a tax.

825
01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:56.351
They got their boats and mistresses,
house payments.

826
01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.397
Nothing I can do.
I'm just a lowly civil servant.

827
01:05:00.689 --> 01:05:02.816
You're their bitch.

828
01:05:03.025 --> 01:05:05.778
- What about me?
- I got your back.

829
01:05:06.028 --> 01:05:10.032
Don't worry, we won't
take anything you'll miss.

830
01:05:11.867 --> 01:05:14.161
I'm sorry. Orders, dog.

831
01:05:14.328 --> 01:05:15.704
No you ain't, cop.

832
01:05:17.873 --> 01:05:19.750
In the kitchen, fellas.

833
01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:22.461
Give me the bitch.

834
01:05:23.754 --> 01:05:26.173
You guys hold him down.

835
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:29.384
- Who'll pay for my floor?
- The city.

836
01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.020
Right here.

837
01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:48.070
Ow!

838
01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.894
That's what I'm talking about.

839
01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:30.779
What's in here?
Coke?

840
01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:32.489
You'll see.

841
01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:36.535
Grab that hammer
and knock this lock off.

842
01:06:38.954 --> 01:06:41.290
One, two...

843
01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:51.925
That's $250,000 you're holding.

844
01:06:52.134 --> 01:06:54.595
Over four million in here.

845
01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:56.805
A $3 million bust on day one.

846
01:06:57.014 --> 01:07:00.267
- You said four.
- Minus tax, brother!

847
01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.978
Nothing's free in this world.

848
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:07.649
Buy your wife a car.
Put the kids through college.

849
01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:10.986
The only checks I cash say "L.A.P.D."

850
01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:15.407
Somebody didn't sleep
through Ethics.

851
01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.161
You don't want a piece of this?

852
01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:23.498
No, right?

853
01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:25.918
Not like this.

854
01:07:26.168 --> 01:07:28.170
No.

855
01:07:28.921 --> 01:07:31.048
No?

856
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:39.348
First time, you're not comfortable.
I'll hold it for you.

857
01:07:39.598 --> 01:07:42.476
- What about you?
- Oh, I'm comfortable.

858
01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:46.146
- How about you?
- I'm very comfortable.

859
01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.523
Let's wrap this up.

860
01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:54.655
Don't touch a thing! Evidence.

861
01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:02.329
Alonzo, what are
those asses thinking?

862
01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:07.000
That I'm gonna stand still and
let them horsefuck me?

863
01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:10.420
Could put you out of your misery.

864
01:08:11.964 --> 01:08:13.257
Hey, Jake, here.

865
01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:17.135
Sit down.

866
01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.350
Here's a secret:

867
01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:25.686
When you kill someone on duty...

868
01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:29.773
...they have to be your slave
in the afterlife.

869
01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:35.737
There you go.

870
01:08:36.071 --> 01:08:37.739
Start an entourage.

871
01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:42.744
- Shoot him?
- Yeah.

872
01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:45.622
Come on, kid. Do me a favor.

873
01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:47.624
Come on.

874
01:08:47.958 --> 01:08:50.043
Do yourself a favor. Hit him.

875
01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:51.586
Are you serious?

876
01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:54.673
Hey, close the blinds.

877
01:09:04.933 --> 01:09:07.477
- All right, I'll shoot him.
- Go.

878
01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.108
- Pow!
- Boom!

879
01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:17.821
Shoot him.

880
01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:19.698
No, man.

881
01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:24.328
Kids these days.
Not gonna do it?

882
01:09:24.536 --> 01:09:27.164
All right, give it to me.

883
01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:28.582
Rookies!

884
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:31.793
You want shit done,
you gotta do it yourself.

885
01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:34.338
Holy shit!

886
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.091
Come on, breathe.

887
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.469
Breathe, there you go.

888
01:09:43.597 --> 01:09:44.848
Just let it go.

889
01:09:46.016 --> 01:09:47.642
Breathe, dog!

890
01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:57.652
He's finished.

891
01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:01.448
- Where's the stinger?
- Right here.

892
01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:06.286
All right, Jeff.

893
01:10:06.495 --> 01:10:08.288
You took fire coming in.

894
01:10:08.497 --> 01:10:12.292
I need some time off, but...
Wow, okay.

895
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:15.587
- Watch the shades.
- All right.

896
01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:20.634
- Ready?
- Kiss me.

897
01:10:20.842 --> 01:10:22.469
One...

898
01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:24.888
- Oh!
- Yeah?

899
01:10:25.097 --> 01:10:26.306
- You okay?
- Yeah.

900
01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:28.975
I gotta give you one more, though.

901
01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:30.227
Do it.

902
01:10:30.477 --> 01:10:32.854
Fuck!

903
01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:36.274
It's not what you know,
it's what you prove.

904
01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:39.986
Here it is.
Mark and Paul kick the door.

905
01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:43.115
Jeff's in first.
Roger fires twice.

906
01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:44.991
Fuck.

907
01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:49.413
- What, one go through?
- Shit!

908
01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:52.833
- You shot him!
- You fucking shot me, man!

909
01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:55.252
- Don't worry.
- Call an ambulance!

910
01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:58.296
Hey, hey, hey! Go to jail, or go home?

911
01:10:58.505 --> 01:11:00.715
All right, here's the scenario.

912
01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:04.344
Mark and Paul kick the door.
Jeff runs in.

913
01:11:04.553 --> 01:11:06.805
Roger opens fire, hits Jeff.

914
01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:11.685
Hoyt is in second,
drops Roger with the shotgun.

915
01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.062
- Who shot Roger?
- New guy.

916
01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:15.730
- New guy.
- You two?

917
01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:19.317
- Hoyt.
- Fuck Hoyt. Ambulance time!

918
01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:21.945
Done. Paul, call them up.

919
01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:24.948
11-49.998. Shots fired.

920
01:11:25.157 --> 01:11:27.784
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

921
01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:30.412
5951 Baxter Street.

922
01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:35.542
Congratulations. You're gonna get
a medal of valor for this.

923
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:38.253
- I didn't shoot him.
- Four cops saw it.

924
01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:40.797
But I didn't. You did.

925
01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:49.222
"An L.A.P.D. narcotics officer
was killed today...

926
01:11:49.431 --> 01:11:52.058
...serving a warrant
in Echo Park."

927
01:11:52.267 --> 01:11:53.768
Give me the bitch.

928
01:11:57.147 --> 01:12:01.485
"A spokesperson said
the officer is survived...

929
01:12:02.903 --> 01:12:04.488
...by a wife and child."

930
01:12:04.863 --> 01:12:07.324
There's more. You get the picture?

931
01:12:07.574 --> 01:12:09.117
Yeah, I get it.

932
01:12:10.202 --> 01:12:13.788
That's the second time
you pointed a gun at me!

933
01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:16.458
Goddamn, boy! That's it, Jake!

934
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:19.294
Y'all see this?
That's it!

935
01:12:19.503 --> 01:12:22.923
- I'll put a bullet in that melon.
- Wait, wait.

936
01:12:23.215 --> 01:12:25.759
I'm gonna be cool. Drop the gun!

937
01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:28.094
Shoot me.
He's coming with me.

938
01:12:28.303 --> 01:12:30.138
- I'll shoot!
- He's a fed.

939
01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:34.851
No, he ain't. He's just a kid
that got the drop on y'all.

940
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:39.648
Let's take a deep breath
and just diffuse this. Jake?

941
01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:42.609
I didn't sign up for this!

942
01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:46.530
I know you're angry.
Everybody, put the guns down.

943
01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:49.324
- HeH, no.
- Choirboy first.

944
01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:51.868
Listen! That's an order!

945
01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:53.995
Put them down!

946
01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:04.172
Use your ears, Jake.

947
01:13:04.381 --> 01:13:07.342
Sometimes we take this shit
all the way.

948
01:13:07.551 --> 01:13:10.053
It's the nature of the business.

949
01:13:10.262 --> 01:13:15.183
You'll never have to pull
the trigger again, all right?

950
01:13:15.642 --> 01:13:18.645
- Mark, where are you transferring?
- S.I.S.

951
01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:20.355
Detective.

952
01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:24.651
You give me 18 months,
I give you a career.

953
01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:27.696
We make the big seizures, Jake.

954
01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:32.075
But if you're in my unit,
you gotta be in it all the way.

955
01:13:32.284 --> 01:13:35.412
I thought you were man enough
to handle this shit.

956
01:13:35.662 --> 01:13:39.499
Five decorated officers say
that you shot Roger.

957
01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:43.545
They will check your blood
for intoxicants.

958
01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.714
What are they gonna find?

959
01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:49.676
You've been smoking PCP all day.

960
01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:53.763
- You've been planning this all day.
- All week, son.

961
01:13:54.014 --> 01:13:57.559
You talk, your blood gets to the lab.

962
01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:01.688
You wanna take a walk?
You won't make it out of here.

963
01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:04.608
If you're cool, you're a hero.

964
01:14:04.816 --> 01:14:06.818
You're above suspicion.

965
01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:09.362
Alonzo, there's two shots left.

966
01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:13.408
We need to kill him now
and say Roger got him.

967
01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.829
No, we ain't killing nobody.

968
01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:21.333
This is a good man. I can feel it.

969
01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:25.503
Just had a little freak-out,
that's all.

970
01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:27.631
I say he's cool.

971
01:14:27.839 --> 01:14:30.634
Nobody's gonna hurt him.

972
01:14:30.842 --> 01:14:33.053
You do have a decision to make.

973
01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:37.599
Because this place is gonna
be overrun with blue suits.

974
01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:42.604
So why don't you please
go outside, clear your head.

975
01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.483
Or shoot me.

976
01:14:59.454 --> 01:15:00.455
Hey, Paul?

977
01:15:05.794 --> 01:15:09.047
You're dead, motherfucker!
You hear me?! Dead!

978
01:16:25.874 --> 01:16:28.877
Well, lay off the device.

979
01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:30.587
All right.

980
01:16:32.338 --> 01:16:34.758
Make sure that tub is clean.

981
01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:37.093
All right?

982
01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.348
All right, later.

983
01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:48.354
You all right?

984
01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:57.739
It behooves you not
to dick around on this one.

985
01:16:58.615 --> 01:17:01.367
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty.

986
01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:04.579
- Now, what happened...
- What happened was murder.

987
01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:07.415
And armed robbery.

988
01:17:07.665 --> 01:17:09.918
We had badges, so it's different?

989
01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.962
Son, open your eyes! Can't you see?

990
01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:17.884
That man was your friend,
and you killed him like a fly.

991
01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:19.886
My friend? Tell me why?

992
01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:23.181
Because he knows my first name?

993
01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:26.226
This is the game.
I played his ass.

994
01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:28.603
That's our job.

995
01:17:28.895 --> 01:17:33.733
Roger sold dope to kids.
The world's better off without him.

996
01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:39.781
This man was the biggest
major violator in Los Angeles.

997
01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:44.452
I watched that cocksucker for years
and now I got him.

998
01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.621
This is chess, not checkers!

999
01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:58.508
What'd you think?
We'd roll up in a black and white?

1000
01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.760
Slap the cuffs on him?

1001
01:18:00.969 --> 01:18:02.971
He's a high roller, dog.

1002
01:18:06.933 --> 01:18:08.977
- Take the money.
- I'm not taking it.

1003
01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:10.645
- Just take it.
- No!

1004
01:18:10.854 --> 01:18:14.983
Look, I don't give a fuck, but
the boys'll feel better.

1005
01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.443
Fuck their feelings!

1006
01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:19.279
Jake, we're a team.

1007
01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:21.447
A team?

1008
01:18:21.656 --> 01:18:24.284
You guys are fucking insane.

1009
01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:28.204
I'll go back to the Valley,
I'll cut parking tickets.

1010
01:18:32.584 --> 01:18:35.128
- It can't be like this.
- It is.

1011
01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:37.088
I'm sorry, but it is.

1012
01:18:37.297 --> 01:18:39.674
It's ugly, but it's necessary.

1013
01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:45.013
I became a cop to put away
dealers and criminals, not to be one.

1014
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.764
You sound just like me.

1015
01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:50.059
I know what you're
going through and feeling.

1016
01:18:50.268 --> 01:18:51.769
- You're scared.
- I'm not.

1017
01:18:51.978 --> 01:18:56.566
Yes, you are. Everyone goes
through that the first time. I did.

1018
01:18:57.567 --> 01:19:01.988
The sooner you match
what's in your head...

1019
01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:05.033
...with what's in the real world...

1020
01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:07.076
...the better you'll feel.

1021
01:19:07.285 --> 01:19:08.995
In this business...

1022
01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:12.832
...you gotta have dirt on you
to be trusted.

1023
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:18.379
When all this is behind you, a whole
other world will open up for you.

1024
01:19:20.715 --> 01:19:23.092
I walk a higher path, son.

1025
01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:26.179
I have the keys to all the doors.

1026
01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:29.223
What do you mean?

1027
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:33.686
My guys aren't leaders, they're clowns.
You're a leader.

1028
01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:35.688
You want my job?
You got it.

1029
01:19:35.939 --> 01:19:39.651
You want to lock up poisoners?
This is the place to do it.

1030
01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:43.863
But you gotta take your time.

1031
01:19:44.072 --> 01:19:47.033
You'll make detective,
you'll grow wise.

1032
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:50.328
And then you can change things.

1033
01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:53.414
But it's gotta be from the inside.

1034
01:19:56.793 --> 01:20:01.422
Let's go downtown to the station.
Talk to my guy, Stan.

1035
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:05.551
He'll go through what you
gotta say to the DA.

1036
01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.853
Okay.

1037
01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:58.104
What are we doing now?

1038
01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:02.734
I told an informant I'd take care
of his family for him.

1039
01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:08.614
Bring them food, stuff like that.

1040
01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:12.285
Gotta help out the family.

1041
01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:16.205
Believe it or not,
I do try to do some good.

1042
01:21:16.456 --> 01:21:19.751
- Right there?
- Just right there.

1043
01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:22.170
You know where you're at, dog?

1044
01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:30.762
The fuck you looking at?

1045
01:21:38.770 --> 01:21:41.314
What's up, punk?

1046
01:22:06.172 --> 01:22:09.467
Hey, we got some things
for the family.

1047
01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:24.357
Kitchen's this way.

1048
01:22:31.781 --> 01:22:33.533
Put it on the counter.

1049
01:22:33.741 --> 01:22:37.036
- Where's the head?
- Right through.

1050
01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:48.714
I'm gonna go to the head.
Two seconds, we're gone.

1051
01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:51.968
Hey, let me get the CD player.

1052
01:22:53.469 --> 01:22:55.263
No, the CD player's mine.

1053
01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.931
Dreamer! Come here!

1054
01:22:58.850 --> 01:23:01.227
Count that shit, all right?

1055
01:23:02.228 --> 01:23:04.605
Thanks a lot, I was busy.

1056
01:23:04.814 --> 01:23:07.859
Learn how to count, fucking math whiz.

1057
01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:12.363
- You looked!
- I didn't.

1058
01:23:12.572 --> 01:23:15.116
You calling me a cheater, <i>ése?</i>

1059
01:23:15.366 --> 01:23:16.993
Deal again, Sniper.

1060
01:23:17.285 --> 01:23:18.953
Damn it.

1061
01:23:20.163 --> 01:23:22.415
You play cards, cop?

1062
01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:24.125
No, not really.

1063
01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.585
Want a beer?

1064
01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:27.128
Have a cold one.

1065
01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.755
No, thanks, I'm good.

1066
01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:33.759
Come on, sit down.
Play a card game with us.

1067
01:23:33.968 --> 01:23:36.637
Don't be rude, <i>ése.</i>
You're a guest.

1068
01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:38.806
Why don't you play one hand?

1069
01:23:39.599 --> 01:23:42.101
Don't worry, we ain't betting money.

1070
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:44.270
We gotta roll in a second.

1071
01:23:44.437 --> 01:23:46.480
Alonzo's taking a shit.

1072
01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:52.320
All right, I'll play one hand.

1073
01:23:53.279 --> 01:23:55.156
Is this five-card draw?

1074
01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:58.534
Yeah, jokers are wild.

1075
01:23:58.826 --> 01:24:01.287
Why don't you tell us something?

1076
01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:04.207
How long you been a pig?

1077
01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:06.792
My bad. My bad.

1078
01:24:07.043 --> 01:24:09.921
I meant a police officer.

1079
01:24:10.213 --> 01:24:12.965
- I've been a pig for 19 months.
- Is that right?

1080
01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:14.800
- That's right.
- You like it?

1081
01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:18.179
I should've been a fireman.
One more.

1082
01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:24.060
- What you got, dog?
- Three of a kind.

1083
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.687
I didn't get shit.

1084
01:24:26.938 --> 01:24:28.940
Boo-ya, baby!

1085
01:24:29.649 --> 01:24:31.734
Two pair!

1086
01:24:35.446 --> 01:24:36.906
What the fuck?

1087
01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:38.991
- He won.
- Smiley.

1088
01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:42.328
I got two pair!

1089
01:24:42.954 --> 01:24:47.083
Three of a kind beats two pair,
you fucking dumb truck.

1090
01:24:49.168 --> 01:24:52.546
You're fucking stupid.
Take your medication.

1091
01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:55.216
Seriously. I know I'm number one.

1092
01:24:55.466 --> 01:24:59.929
See why we don't play for money?
Because of this <i>vato.</i>

1093
01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:02.765
- Show me your <i>cohete.</i>
- What?

1094
01:25:02.974 --> 01:25:06.644
Your gun, homes.
Underneath your shirt.

1095
01:25:07.061 --> 01:25:09.230
What is it, .380 stainless?

1096
01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:11.190
- 9mm Beretta.
- Like that?

1097
01:25:14.402 --> 01:25:16.153
- Just like it.
- Yeah?

1098
01:25:16.737 --> 01:25:18.281
Here's the problem.

1099
01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:22.743
I seen this one.
I want to see yours.

1100
01:25:24.287 --> 01:25:27.748
Come on, <i>ése,</i>
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

1101
01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:33.004
Come on. Let me check it out.

1102
01:25:41.512 --> 01:25:45.516
- Damn. Learn that in the Academy?
- Yeah.

1103
01:25:45.725 --> 01:25:48.519
Neat trick.
This is nice.

1104
01:25:48.728 --> 01:25:52.773
Nice.
You could fuck a <i>veto</i> up with this.

1105
01:25:54.942 --> 01:25:58.112
What you do is, you aim like that.

1106
01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:03.617
I'm just playing.

1107
01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:06.620
Yeah, I gotta go.
Alonzo!

1108
01:26:07.621 --> 01:26:09.707
Kick back and party.

1109
01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:12.501
Ain't nothing out there for you.

1110
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:14.920
What are you talking about?

1111
01:26:18.132 --> 01:26:19.508
Hey, white boy.

1112
01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:24.263
If you ask me homes,
that's just, of course, if you ask...

1113
01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:26.515
...Alonzo played you, ése-

1114
01:26:27.016 --> 01:26:29.310
Big time.

1115
01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:32.104
Wait, where you going?

1116
01:26:33.189 --> 01:26:36.067
It's your deal.

1117
01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:48.079
It's all there.

1118
01:26:48.454 --> 01:26:51.457
- Sure?
- You can count it yourself.

1119
01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:53.584
Whatever.

1120
01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:59.632
Alonzo pulled off a miracle.

1121
01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:02.635
Times are tight.
Scared up a lot of cash.

1122
01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:05.137
Who'd he jack, homes?

1123
01:27:05.596 --> 01:27:06.972
I don't know.

1124
01:27:10.768 --> 01:27:13.145
He jacked Roger.

1125
01:27:13.354 --> 01:27:14.897
Blasted that fool.

1126
01:27:15.106 --> 01:27:19.026
Alonzo's a low-down, ruthless <i>vato.</i>

1127
01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:21.112
But I like that.

1128
01:27:21.362 --> 01:27:25.783
No. That's why I never
shake his hand.

1129
01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:28.702
He don't respect <i>nada.</i>

1130
01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:31.372
Know what the money's for?

1131
01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:34.667
Alonzo, he's a hothead.

1132
01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:38.337
Last week in Vegas, some Russian
starts talking shit.

1133
01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:41.507
Alonzo, he just snapped.

1134
01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:44.051
Beat his ass to death.

1135
01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:47.888
Turns out, that Russian,
he's a somebody.

1136
01:27:48.139 --> 01:27:53.060
Now, Alonzo's into the Russians
for a million.

1137
01:27:53.436 --> 01:27:55.438
How do you know that?

1138
01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.027
Alonzo has until tonight to pay up.

1139
01:28:02.236 --> 01:28:04.780
But he's still on their list.

1140
01:28:05.156 --> 01:28:08.033
Nobody thought he could
get the cash.

1141
01:28:09.076 --> 01:28:12.580
Good thing he did.
They're looking for him.

1142
01:28:13.539 --> 01:28:19.253
If he don't turn up downtown with
the cash by midnight...

1143
01:28:19.462 --> 01:28:21.172
Your <i>vato...</i>

1144
01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:22.756
...he's dead.

1145
01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.758
Hey, pig.

1146
01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:27.470
Ever had your shit pushed in?

1147
01:28:28.262 --> 01:28:29.638
Simple question.

1148
01:28:29.847 --> 01:28:31.140
- No?
- No.

1149
01:28:31.557 --> 01:28:34.101
- Had my shit pushed in.
- Yeah, man.

1150
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:38.230
I had my shit pushed in, bro!

1151
01:28:38.439 --> 01:28:40.065
Big time!

1152
01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.444
Smiley?

1153
01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:47.615
Sure, I always get love
from the homeys.

1154
01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.835
You guys fucked him up!

1155
01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:01.420
Go next door.

1156
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:03.923
Get the fuck out of here!

1157
01:29:06.133 --> 01:29:08.469
You fucked up.

1158
01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:10.638
You're under arrest!

1159
01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:15.476
For being a cop, dogging me
in the mouth in my own pad.

1160
01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:19.897
You got the right
to be bitch-slapped!

1161
01:29:23.317 --> 01:29:24.777
Drag him to the tub.

1162
01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:26.654
Punk motherfucker!

1163
01:29:28.614 --> 01:29:33.369
- Come on. Raid his ass!
- Shit! God!

1164
01:29:35.246 --> 01:29:36.455
Fuck!

1165
01:29:53.514 --> 01:29:54.640
Do it!

1166
01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:56.642
It's gonna be loud.

1167
01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:02.690
Let me get his money.

1168
01:30:03.399 --> 01:30:05.150
- Wait.
- Hurry up.

1169
01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:14.201
Smiley, check it out.

1170
01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:16.870
Is that your little cousin?

1171
01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:26.672
- What's this?
- I found it!

1172
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.507
- Who had it?
- I found it!

1173
01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:30.342
Where?

1174
01:30:30.551 --> 01:30:34.388
I found it in MacArthur Park!
MacArthur Park!

1175
01:30:39.393 --> 01:30:41.604
Wait up, I can't even see.

1176
01:30:41.812 --> 01:30:43.252
- Please!
- Shut the fuck up!

1177
01:30:43.439 --> 01:30:45.566
Get in your last prayer.

1178
01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:47.401
Listen to me, man.

1179
01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:49.236
She was being raped.

1180
01:30:49.445 --> 01:30:52.448
Two crackheads were attacking her...

1181
01:30:52.698 --> 01:30:55.618
...and I stopped them!
I swear to God!

1182
01:30:55.868 --> 01:30:58.370
- You're lying to me!
- I am not lying!

1183
01:30:58.537 --> 01:31:02.333
- Don't lie to me!
- She was being raped!

1184
01:31:02.541 --> 01:31:03.876
I stopped them!

1185
01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:05.711
Please! I got a kid.

1186
01:31:05.919 --> 01:31:08.797
- Shut up, fag!
- Blast his ass.

1187
01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:12.718
I have a little girl!

1188
01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:14.428
Do it!

1189
01:31:16.055 --> 01:31:20.601
I'm gonna get to the bottom of your
bullshit. She's my cousin, homes.

1190
01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:22.770
Ain't right involving her.

1191
01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:24.104
You fucked up.

1192
01:31:28.567 --> 01:31:30.778
If you're lying to me...

1193
01:31:30.986 --> 01:31:32.613
...I blow your balls off.

1194
01:31:32.821 --> 01:31:34.448
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hey, Letty.

1195
01:31:34.657 --> 01:31:36.617
- What's up?
<i>- Hey, Smiley.</i>

1196
01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:39.620
Just doing homework. You want Tony?

1197
01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:41.246
No, I want you.

1198
01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:44.416
- You go to school today?
- Yeah.

1199
01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.960
- You didn't ditch?
<i>- Nope.</i>

1200
01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:49.797
I went to every class. Why?

1201
01:31:50.047 --> 01:31:51.924
I heard different.

1202
01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:56.428
- No.
- Cops talk to you today?

1203
01:31:59.473 --> 01:32:02.309
- No, no.
<i>- All right, Letty...</i>

1204
01:32:02.559 --> 01:32:04.144
...don't bullshit me.

1205
01:32:08.565 --> 01:32:11.151
I got jumped by two crackheads.

1206
01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.572
- You got jumped?
<i>- I think they wanted to rape me.</i>

1207
01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:18.158
<i>But nothing happened, okay?</i>

1208
01:32:18.367 --> 01:32:20.411
Because this cop came.

1209
01:32:20.619 --> 01:32:22.830
<i>They almost killed him...</i>

1210
01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:25.124
<i>...but he kicked their ass.</i>

1211
01:32:25.332 --> 01:32:26.709
Describe him.

1212
01:32:26.917 --> 01:32:31.463
He was a white boy.
He looked real young.

1213
01:32:32.089 --> 01:32:34.717
- You're okay?
<i>- Yeah, I’m fine.</i>

1214
01:32:34.967 --> 01:32:36.301
- Hey, Letty.
- Yeah?

1215
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:37.803
We're not done.

1216
01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:39.221
- Okay.
<i>- All right.</i>

1217
01:32:40.556 --> 01:32:41.724
What's up?

1218
01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:43.684
You gonna blast him?

1219
01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:48.897
Vato was telling the truth.

1220
01:32:49.106 --> 01:32:50.858
Life's a trip, <i>qué no?</i>

1221
01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:53.152
This is some trippy shit.

1222
01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:10.335
That's for getting my cousin's back.

1223
01:33:12.045 --> 01:33:15.215
Cover your head.
You'll mess up my floor.

1224
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:19.052
You know this was just
business, right?

1225
01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:23.098
Right?

1226
01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:28.103
Right.

1227
01:34:41.927 --> 01:34:45.764
What you doing here?
You know you don't belong here.

1228
01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:52.563
- What's up?
- Must be lost.

1229
01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:56.984
Gonna need more than that
up in here, boy!

1230
01:35:09.955 --> 01:35:12.124
You got business here, rookie?

1231
01:35:12.541 --> 01:35:14.668
I'm here for Alonzo.

1232
01:36:24.571 --> 01:36:27.407
Hey. Is your dad home?

1233
01:36:27.616 --> 01:36:30.035
- In the bedroom.
- He's in the bedroom?

1234
01:36:30.202 --> 01:36:32.871
All right, you wanna open up the door?

1235
01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:36.750
Okay. Thanks. You watching TV?

1236
01:36:38.043 --> 01:36:39.670
Yeah, anything good on?

1237
01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:51.682
- Do you want me to call my mom?
- No, I don't.

1238
01:36:52.808 --> 01:36:54.810
I'll tell you what I want.

1239
01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:57.229
Find a good hiding spot.

1240
01:36:57.437 --> 01:37:00.273
Do you have a favorite place to hide?

1241
01:37:01.191 --> 01:37:04.736
- The closet.
- In the closet? That's perfect.

1242
01:37:05.278 --> 01:37:09.241
Okay, open up the closet.
All right. Good, good.

1243
01:37:09.449 --> 01:37:11.660
Can you sit down in there?

1244
01:37:12.077 --> 01:37:16.123
All right. Now stay in here
and be very quiet.

1245
01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.167
I'll be right back. All right?

1246
01:37:46.695 --> 01:37:48.488
It's all good, baby.

1247
01:37:56.121 --> 01:37:57.664
You, against the wall.

1248
01:37:57.873 --> 01:38:01.209
Move real slow.
Put the money in that bag...

1249
01:38:01.418 --> 01:38:05.505
...take your weapons and place them
inside that pillowcase.

1250
01:38:07.466 --> 01:38:11.386
Congratulations, son. You made it.

1251
01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:13.889
You passed the test. You're a narc.

1252
01:38:14.139 --> 01:38:17.642
Put the gun down before you give
her a heart attack.

1253
01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:20.228
I said put the money in that bag.

1254
01:38:20.437 --> 01:38:23.565
Place your weapons
inside that pillowcase.

1255
01:38:23.774 --> 01:38:26.818
Fuck your appointment
with the Russians.

1256
01:38:27.027 --> 01:38:29.154
Oh, okay.

1257
01:38:30.155 --> 01:38:32.574
Okay. Hand me the pillowcase, baby.

1258
01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.368
Baby! Hand me the pillowcase.

1259
01:38:36.036 --> 01:38:37.537
You're gonna book me?

1260
01:38:37.954 --> 01:38:39.498
You smoked the dust.

1261
01:38:39.706 --> 01:38:43.668
You ran out, and you're the one
that shot Roger.

1262
01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:48.215
- Here you go.
- And the one on your ankle?

1263
01:38:48.757 --> 01:38:51.468
- Want the one in my back pocket too?
- I would.

1264
01:38:55.263 --> 01:38:57.682
One problem: You got no witnesses.

1265
01:38:57.891 --> 01:39:01.686
Who are your witnesses, huh?
Roger? Smiley?

1266
01:39:01.895 --> 01:39:03.605
You think they'll help you?

1267
01:39:04.231 --> 01:39:10.195
It's not what you know.
It's what you can prove. Here.

1268
01:39:12.614 --> 01:39:15.492
What can you prove, huh? Nothing.

1269
01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:17.828
- Where's your evidence?
- There.

1270
01:39:21.498 --> 01:39:22.624
Oh, shit!

1271
01:39:27.796 --> 01:39:29.756
It's on now, Jake.

1272
01:39:31.049 --> 01:39:32.467
Don't move.

1273
01:39:35.137 --> 01:39:36.763
Where you at, Jake?

1274
01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:38.807
Come on out, dog!

1275
01:39:40.976 --> 01:39:44.396
<i>O where, O where
Has my little Jake gone?</i>

1276
01:39:45.564 --> 01:39:48.984
<i>O where, O where can he be?</i>

1277
01:39:52.237 --> 01:39:55.448
- Ah! I see you.
- Shit!

1278
01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.791
I'm surgical with this bitch.
How you want it?

1279
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.296
That fool in the wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

1280
01:40:11.923 --> 01:40:15.051
- Mommy.
- Alonzito!

1281
01:40:17.929 --> 01:40:19.264
You see what I see?

1282
01:40:20.182 --> 01:40:24.394
Officer Hoyt, job number one:
Preserve life.

1283
01:40:24.603 --> 01:40:27.314
There's my son. Don't hurt him.

1284
01:40:27.522 --> 01:40:29.774
We're walking out together.

1285
01:40:48.501 --> 01:40:51.379
Alonzito! Alonzito!

1286
01:40:56.301 --> 01:40:58.553
- You all right?
- I want my mommy.

1287
01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:00.305
I know, I know, I know.

1288
01:41:00.513 --> 01:41:03.016
Just sit tight, all right?

1289
01:41:03.225 --> 01:41:06.937
It's gonna be all right. I know.

1290
01:41:08.063 --> 01:41:09.981
Shut the fuck up!

1291
01:41:12.734 --> 01:41:15.987
All right, let me see your hands!
Where is he?

1292
01:41:16.196 --> 01:41:18.406
- The window.
- Come on!

1293
01:41:18.615 --> 01:41:20.617
- Get your kid, stay down.
- Alonzito!

1294
01:46:23.211 --> 01:46:25.171
Hey, man, you tripping?

1295
01:46:25.505 --> 01:46:28.633
It's no fun when the rabbit
has the gun, is it?

1296
01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:31.844
My nigga.

1297
01:46:34.847 --> 01:46:39.018
Hey, first Damu puts one
in his head...

1298
01:46:40.645 --> 01:46:42.730
...I'll make you a rich man!

1299
01:46:43.731 --> 01:46:45.191
Come on now.

1300
01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:46.651
Who wanna get paid?

1301
01:46:48.486 --> 01:46:50.029
Who wanna get paid?

1302
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:55.660
They're not like you.

1303
01:46:56.703 --> 01:46:58.955
You know what I learned today?

1304
01:46:59.664 --> 01:47:03.876
- I'm not like you.
- That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

1305
01:47:05.253 --> 01:47:09.090
Good. So, what now? Huh?

1306
01:47:10.216 --> 01:47:12.093
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1307
01:47:12.302 --> 01:47:15.179
You gonna bust your cherry
killing a cop?

1308
01:47:20.977 --> 01:47:22.562
There it is, Jake.

1309
01:47:24.397 --> 01:47:25.440
Hit me.

1310
01:47:26.816 --> 01:47:31.112
You never killed nobody before.
It ain't like stepping on ants.

1311
01:47:31.696 --> 01:47:33.281
Takes a man to kill.

1312
01:47:35.033 --> 01:47:37.076
Are you man enough to kill?

1313
01:47:39.454 --> 01:47:40.705
Hit me right there.

1314
01:47:45.209 --> 01:47:49.130
Get me, Jake. Get me.
Hit me. Hit me.

1315
01:47:49.339 --> 01:47:54.052
You can't do it.
Somebody drop this fool for me.

1316
01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:15.031
You got us twisted.
You got to put your own work in.

1317
01:48:16.282 --> 01:48:20.036
- All right. It's like that, Bone?
- It's like that.

1318
01:48:23.831 --> 01:48:27.418
Player to player, pimp to pimp.

1319
01:48:27.627 --> 01:48:30.505
- I don't believe you'd shoot me.
- Don't do it.

1320
01:48:31.798 --> 01:48:34.842
- Don't.
- I don't believe you got it in you.

1321
01:48:35.259 --> 01:48:36.344
Shit.

1322
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:48.690
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1323
01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:50.900
You ain't gonna do a thing.

1324
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:54.404
You ain't gonna shoot no cop
in the back.

1325
01:48:55.321 --> 01:48:57.782
- Don't do it.
- You know what you'd get?

1326
01:48:57.990 --> 01:49:01.369
The gas chamber.
You know what it smells like?

1327
01:49:01.577 --> 01:49:05.873
Pine oil. That's where you headed,
to pine oil heaven.

1328
01:49:06.082 --> 01:49:08.710
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1329
01:49:08.918 --> 01:49:12.422
I don't think you got it in you.
I'm gonna go get it.

1330
01:49:14.006 --> 01:49:17.969
Shit! Ah, you motherfucker!

1331
01:49:18.428 --> 01:49:20.388
The next one will kill you.

1332
01:49:20.596 --> 01:49:23.850
Son of a bitch!
You shot me in the ass!

1333
01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:25.601
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1334
01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:27.311
Okay, okay.

1335
01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.232
All right. Come on, I need
the money. Give me the money.

1336
01:49:32.066 --> 01:49:35.153
- Give me that money!
- It's not gonna happen.

1337
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:38.614
You gonna take my own money from me?

1338
01:49:38.865 --> 01:49:42.535
That's my evidence.
You wanna go to jail or go home?

1339
01:49:45.246 --> 01:49:46.914
I wanna go home, Jake.

1340
01:49:48.833 --> 01:49:51.753
Give me the money,
and let me go home.

1341
01:49:51.961 --> 01:49:55.047
- You wanna go home?
- Yeah, let me go home, Jake.

1342
01:49:55.256 --> 01:49:57.508
Give me the money,
and let me go.

1343
01:49:59.135 --> 01:50:02.138
Give me the money,
and let me go home, Jake.

1344
01:50:02.346 --> 01:50:03.848
That's right, come on.

1345
01:50:07.268 --> 01:50:09.103
You don't deserve this.

1346
01:50:10.521 --> 01:50:11.856
Okay, motherfucker.

1347
01:50:17.653 --> 01:50:19.572
Jake, go and bounce, homey.

1348
01:50:19.781 --> 01:50:22.867
Get up out of here. We got your back.

1349
01:50:23.868 --> 01:50:24.994
What?

1350
01:50:25.203 --> 01:50:27.872
- It's like that.
- Oh, no, you didn't!

1351
01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:31.793
Wait a minute! No, you...
Hey, hey, Jake!

1352
01:50:32.001 --> 01:50:35.505
Hey! Hey! Jake!

1353
01:50:35.713 --> 01:50:37.715
Jake, come back here!

1354
01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:40.384
Jake!

1355
01:50:42.887 --> 01:50:46.182
You disloyal, fool-ass,
bitch-made punk.

1356
01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:50.269
I need my money!

1357
01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:54.148
Jake!

1358
01:50:57.109 --> 01:51:00.905
Oh, you motherfuckers! Okay.

1359
01:51:01.239 --> 01:51:04.784
All right! I'm putting cases
on all you bitches!

1360
01:51:04.992 --> 01:51:08.412
Huh? You think you can do this shit?
Jake!

1361
01:51:09.205 --> 01:51:11.624
You think you can do this to me?!

1362
01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:16.504
You motherfuckers will be playing
basketball in Pelican Bay...

1363
01:51:16.712 --> 01:51:19.090
...when I get finished with you!

1364
01:51:19.632 --> 01:51:21.759
Shoe program, nigga!

1365
01:51:22.468 --> 01:51:24.679
Twenty-three hour lock-down!

1366
01:51:24.929 --> 01:51:27.014
I'm the man up in this piece!

1367
01:51:27.682 --> 01:51:30.685
