00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.600
I'm sorry!

2
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.560
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

3
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.560
Hey! It worked better that time.

4
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.360
I thought about Mom.

5
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.360
Isn't that strange?

6
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.240
Yeah. I guess so.

7
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.960
Just stop doing that stuff around me.

8
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.760
I always get wet.

9
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.800
"My brother and I live
in the Southern Water Tribe"...

10
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880
"which was once a big city."

11
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.600
"Our father is off
fighting in The War."

12
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.240
"My mother was taken prisoner
and killed when I was young."

13
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.600
"In this time of war,
food is scarce."

14
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.640
"My brother and I often
go hunting for food, but"...

15
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.080
"unfortunately, my brother
isn't the best hunter in the world."

16
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.160
- Tiger seal.
- Are you sure?

17
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.160
I did everything Dad said to do.

18
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.136
I watched which side
of the fin tracks are more indented.

19
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.616
That shows you which
direction they're going.

20
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.480
I saw how long the drag skids are.

21
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.680
That shows you
how fast they're going.

22
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.480
There's something under there.

23
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.360
It's a cave-in!

24
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.440
Move away from the cracks!

25
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.200
Katara, don't go near it.

26
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.760
This is probably
some Fire Nation trick.

27
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.680
Just back away really slow.

28
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.920
Katara!
Do not hit that sphere!

29
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.160
Uncle, look!

30
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.480
Is he breathing?

31
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.760
Did you see that light
shoot into the sky?

32
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.320
What's your name?

33
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.400
How did you get here?

34
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.160
How did you get in the ice?

35
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.200
He's exhausted.

36
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.760
We need to get him
back to the village.

37
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.720
What is this thing?

38
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.600
It's trying to eat me!

39
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.360
See?

40
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.200
How'd you get all the way out here?

41
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.920
I ran away from home.

42
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.320
We got in a storm.

43
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.880
We were forced
under the water of the ocean.

44
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.040
- I see.
- It wasn't very smart.

45
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.880
I was just upset.

46
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.280
- Thanks for saving me.
- Lucky.

47
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.120
I probably should get home.
They'll all be worried.

48
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.600
- You're not still upset?
- Not as much as I was.

49
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.400
- The Fire Nation is here.
- What?

50
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.480
And they brought their machines.

51
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.080
Don't come out
'till I tell you it's safe.

52
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.320
Is something wrong?

53
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.560
No. Please wait here.

54
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.080
- Hurry, now!
- Secure the area!

55
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.456
It can't be coincidence
that we break him out of the ice...

56
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.176
light shoots into the sky
and now the Fire Nation...

57
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.040
is here with their machines.

58
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.200
Sokka, don't.

59
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.760
I am Prince Zuko...

60
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.240
son of Fire Lord Ozai
and heir to the throne!

61
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.080
Bring me all your elderly!

62
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.800
- Papa!
- Move!

63
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.200
Yeah?

64
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.160
Grandma!

65
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.160
Please don't.
Don't harm him!

66
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.760
Come on!

67
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.320
Katara, don't.

68
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.960
- Form a line!
- Come on!

69
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.280
Here.

70
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.240
Hey.

71
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.640
Granny!

72
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.320
You're scaring these people.

73
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.840
Who are you?
What's your name?

74
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.920
- I don't need to tell you anything.
- Firebenders!

75
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.960
I'm taking you to my ship.

76
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.240
If you don't come,
I'll burn down this village.

77
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.160
I'll go with you.

78
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.280
Don't hurt anyone.

79
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.936
They were looking for someone old
and they were looking for someone...

80
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.800
with the same markings the boy had.

81
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.040
They dragged Mom away
the same way when we were babies.

82
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.296
She wouldn't have stood
and watched us...

83
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.440
being taken away.
She would have fought.

84
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.360
We found that boy.
He's our responsibility.

85
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.320
We should fight!

86
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.720
What would you do
if they tried to take me away?

87
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.760
I'd kill them all.

88
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.680
- Why?
- Because you're my sister.

89
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.600
Because Dad told me
to protect you with my life.

90
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.440
Because I'm your responsibility.

91
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.680
And this boy is our responsibility.

92
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.720
What do you want us to do, Katara?

93
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.720
How are we supposed to save him?

94
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.816
They're on a ship.
We'd need a miracle to catch them.

95
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.360
I know you think everything's
going to work out, but I don't.

96
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.400
His bison creature thing floats.

97
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.400
What do you want with me?

98
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.920
My nephew wants me to perform
a little test on you.

99
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.840
- What kind of test?
- I assure you, it won't hurt.

100
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.360
I've performed it hundreds of times.
It only takes a few moments.

101
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.480
And then you're free to go.

102
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.360
Would you mind if I put a few things
in front of you at the table?

103
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.680
It will only take a moment.

104
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.760
That's all you want?

105
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.400
My name is Iroh,
and you have my word.

106
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.456
Grandma, I know
you're going to try to stop us...

107
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.280
- but this is just something I need.
- Sit down.

108
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.760
I knew from the first time
we discovered you were a Bender...

109
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.080
that one day,
I would realize your destiny.

110
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.840
There hasn't been a Waterbender
in the Southern Water Tribe...

111
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.960
since my friend Hama was taken away.

112
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.600
Today, I found out that destiny.

113
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.480
Did you see that boy's tattoos?

114
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.640
Tattoos like that haven't been seen
in over a century.

115
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.480
I believe they are
Airbending tattoos.

116
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.440
How can that be?

117
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.000
I believe that little boy
might be the Avatar.

118
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.280
Once, a long time ago...

119
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.480
the Spirit World
kept balance over us.

120
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.680
What is the Spirit World, Grandma?

121
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.560
It's not a place made up
of things you can touch.

122
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.480
But it exists, nonetheless.

123
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.480
It is filled with
the most amazing forms...

124
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.920
of dazzling creatures that
exist in the most exotic valleys...

125
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.680
mountains and forests.

126
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.760
Each of these creatures is a Spirit.

127
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.880
They've watched over us
since the beginning.

128
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.840
They have guided us.

129
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.720
And only the Avatar
can go speak to them.

130
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.520
Aren't there Spirits here?

131
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.320
Yes, there are some Spirits
that live hidden among us...

132
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.640
sure they're watching us
with great sadness.

133
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.520
The Fire Nation doesn't wish
to live by the Spirits.

134
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.240
That's why they're so frightened
by the existence of the Avatar.

135
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.640
- What can he do?
- With his mastery...

136
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.080
of the four elements,
he will begin to change hearts.

137
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.600
And it is in the heart
that all wars are won.

138
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.240
Now, go help this boy.

139
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.240
He will need you two.

140
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.560
And we all need him.

141
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.680
You are my prisoner...

142
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.240
Airbender.

143
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.880
I'm taking you back
to the Fire Nation.

144
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.360
- You said I...
- I apologize.

145
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.440
I should have explained further.

146
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.640
If you failed the test,
as all others did...

147
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.280
you were free to leave.

148
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.000
But, as it turns out, you are
the only one in the entire world...

149
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.560
who could pass this test.

150
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.400
It is truly an honor
to be in your presence.

151
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.600
Don't even try to escape.
This is a warship!

152
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.320
Stop! There's no way you can...

153
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.120
Don't move!
You have nowhere to run!

154
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.480
Halt!

155
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.360
Don't let him escape!

156
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.680
Get him!

157
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.640
Thanks for bringing Appa to me.

158
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.680
The Fire Nation is up to something.
I have to go back now.

159
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.960
- We'll come with you.
- I can take you back to the village.

160
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.480
We're going with you.

161
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.240
You found the Avatar.

162
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.480
For a moment, I had my honor back.

163
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.800
Your destinies are tied, Zuko.
That, you can be sure of.

164
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.600
"Aang flew us to his home."

165
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.040
"He told us how he left there
in a storm on Appa"...

166
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.160
"and got forced into the ocean
where they almost drowned."

167
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.680
"Aang Airbended a sphere around them,
and ice formed."

168
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.320
"And he couldn't remember
anything after that."

169
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.880
Hey, Chinto!
Monae! I'm back!

170
00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.360
Hey, guys!
I want you to meet someone!

171
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.400
This is where you live?

172
00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.600
They must be playing
some trick or something.

173
00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.256
Monk Gyatso is going to try
and jump out...

174
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.760
and scare me at any moment.

175
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.400
He's the teacher responsible for me.

176
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.240
He's kind of like my father.

177
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.480
Is it okay if you tell me
your name?

178
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.440
The monks named me Aang.

179
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.840
Okay, guys! Enough!

180
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.400
Spider-rat! They're poisonous!
Get behind me.

181
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.920
He's a flying lemur-bat.
We keep them as pets.

182
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.680
Weren't they extinct a long time ago?

183
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.760
Extinct? No.

184
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.640
There must be thousands
of them on this mountain.

185
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.560
Your friends were monks?

186
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.360
I know where they are right now.
They're at the prayer field!

187
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.680
Aang, wait!
I have to talk to you!

188
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.240
Aang...

189
00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:02.480
I think you were in that ice
for almost a hundred years.

190
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.240
The Firebenders started a war.

191
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.120
I left a few days ago.

192
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.680
Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar
would be born into the Air Nomads...

193
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.960
so they exterminated
all the Air Nomads.

194
00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.600
You're lying!

195
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.320
This is Monk Gyatso's.

196
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.520
I made it for him.

197
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.760
No!

198
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.800
Katara! Stay away from him!

199
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.160
Katara!

200
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.160
Stay away from him!

201
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.760
"Your friends were monks?"

202
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.280
The Avatar?

203
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.280
Where have you been?

204
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.840
"Aang!"

205
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.360
"You can't bring Monk Gyatso back"...

206
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.200
"but Sokka and I can be with you
as long as you need!"

207
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.400
"Don't give up!
We can do this together!"

208
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.840
"Aang!"

209
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.080
The banished prince.

210
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.600
Let's offer him lunch.

211
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.360
I wanted to thank
the great General Iroh...

212
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.040
and young Prince Zuko
for dining with us.

213
00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.640
As you know, the Fire Lord
has banished his son, the Prince...

214
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.976
and renounced his love of him,
and will not let him return...

215
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.480
to the throne unless
he finds the Avatar.

216
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.640
The Fire Lord believes
his son is too soft...

217
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.600
and by doing this,
he will become strong...

218
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.080
and become a worthy heir
to the throne.

219
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.440
I commend the Fire Lord's discipline.

220
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.360
For example, it seems
I need to remind Prince Zuko...

221
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.320
that, during his banishment,
he is an enemy of the Fire Nation...

222
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.200
and is not allowed to wear
the Fire Nation uniform.

223
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.680
But we will let him wear it today...

224
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.080
like a child wearing a costume.

225
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.640
One day, my father will take me back
and you will bow before me.

226
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.680
You okay?

227
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.360
I'll be fine.

228
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.800
You know, my grandma thinks
because you're an Airbender...

229
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.560
that you could be the Avatar.

230
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.760
How much does
the Fire Nation control?

231
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.896
A lot of villages
in the Earth Kingdom...

232
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.160
like around here.

233
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.360
They haven't been able to conquer
big cities, like Ba Sing Se...

234
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.320
but they're making plans, I'm sure.

235
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
So...

236
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.800
are you the Avatar, Aang?

237
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.520
What is this?

238
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.720
Stay hidden.

239
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.280
- That child is being arrested.
- For what?

240
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.360
He was bending tiny stones at us
from behind a tree.

241
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.760
- It really hurt.
- He can bend earth?

242
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.720
Earthbending is forbidden
in this village.

243
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.600
Leave him alone.

244
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.960
You're not taking him anywhere.

245
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.560
No one is taking anybody away!

246
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.120
She's a bender!

247
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.360
Katara!

248
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.160
Move.

249
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.520
- You, too.
- Dad!

250
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.480
- This is my father.
- Hello.

251
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.160
That's the Fire Nation's plan,
suppress all other bending.

252
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.760
How did this happen to your village?

253
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.560
Fire Nation sent soldiers.
We fought them and defeated them.

254
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.400
Then they sent their machines...

255
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.760
huge machines made of metal.

256
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.160
There was nothing we could do.

257
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.160
Those who could not bend
were allowed to live in peace...

258
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.400
if we were imprisoned.

259
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.600
Earthbenders!

260
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.080
Why are you acting this way?
You are powerful and amazing people!

261
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.080
You don't need to live like this!

262
00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.840
There is earth
right beneath your feet.

263
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.760
The ground is an extension
of who you are!

264
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.560
If the Avatar had returned...

265
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.680
would that mean anything to you?

266
00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.960
The Avatar is dead.
If he was here, he would protect us.

267
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.640
My name is Aang...

268
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.200
and I am the Avatar.

269
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.560
I ran away, but I'm back now.

270
00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.920
It's time for you to stop doing this!

271
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.560
The Avatar would have
to be an Airbender.

272
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.480
Are you an Airbender, boy?

273
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.560
Leave him alone!

274
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.000
How is he doing that?

275
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.800
I don't want to hurt anyone.

276
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.200
All Airbenders should be dead.
Kill him! Firebenders, positions!

277
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.800
Okay! Everybody can help us now!

278
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.720
Don't be afraid!

279
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.160
Just leave them!

280
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.440
Fall back!

281
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.440
Go! He's an Airbender!

282
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.120
They took away any tools
related to bending.

283
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.640
The Fire Nation took this scroll
from a member of your Water Tribe.

284
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.160
A Waterbending scroll.

285
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.040
This is rare.
My mom told me about these.

286
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.880
This was you when
you were born an Earthbender...

287
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.280
two lifetimes ago.

288
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.600
You came to our village.

289
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.840
Avatar Kyoshi loved games.

290
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.080
I do, too.
I mean, I still do.

291
00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.896
A lot of the villages in this part
of the Earth Kingdom are occupied...

292
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.400
by the Fire Nation,
like this village was.

293
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.200
They prey on the weakest
towns and villages.

294
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.200
We should go visit
some of these towns, Aang.

295
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.240
- I need to tell you something.
- What is it, Aang?

296
00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.560
I ran away before they trained me
to be the Avatar.

297
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.840
I don't know how to bend
the other elements.

298
00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.880
Why did you run away?

299
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.080
The day they told me
I was the Avatar...

300
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.440
they said I could never
have a normal life...

301
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.560
that I could never have a family.

302
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.560
They said it cannot work with
the responsibilities of the Avatar.

303
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.680
- Why can't the Avatar have a family?
- I asked that!

304
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.840
They said that's the sacrifice
the Avatar always has to make.

305
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.600
Okay. So, what if we
found you teachers.

306
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.456
Teachers to teach you bending?
Which element would...

307
00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.320
- you have to learn first?
- Water.

308
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.680
Water comes after Air in the cycle.

309
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.320
Air, Water, Earth, Fire.

310
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.400
But there are really powerful benders
in the Northern Water Tribe.

311
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.240
My dad told me about it
before he left.

312
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.760
It's led by a princess
because her father died.

313
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.616
There are teachers there for sure,
but they are all the way...

314
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.880
on the other side of the world.

315
00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.360
- We can get there on Appa.
- That's what I was thinking.

316
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.440
And maybe we can stop
in the villages on the way...

317
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.040
start a change in The War
in these small villages.

318
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.000
- Should we try it?
- Yes, we should.

319
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.360
"The scroll we had
was proving to be helpful."

320
00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.920
"Aang was practicing,
but for some reason"...

321
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.880
"he was having trouble
with Waterbending."

322
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.440
"We moved from town to town
in the Earth Kingdom."

323
00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.840
"We tried to stay
out of sight, but"...

324
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.800
"Sokka became concerned
we were being followed."

325
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.200
Sire, I have good news.

326
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.440
As you know, I conducted a raid
on the Great Library...

327
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.880
- which most said didn't exist.
- Get on with it.

328
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.040
I have found scrolls in the library.

329
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.720
We are deciphering them.

330
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.680
But I believe they may
contain information...

331
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.400
as to where the Ocean
and Moon Spirits...

332
00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.800
live in this world.
With this information...

333
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.360
we could bring down
the Northern Water Tribe city...

334
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.120
we could show the world
the true strength of fire.

335
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.160
I am pleased.

336
00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.920
Well, Commander Zhao,
are the rumors true or not?

337
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.440
Our spies have discovered someone
claiming to be the Avatar.

338
00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.640
They describe him as just a boy.

339
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.400
We should set a trap for this person.

340
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.920
We have many Earth Kingdom people
under our control.

341
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.320
I can leave soldiers
hidden in certain locations.

342
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:16.040
- And my son?
- He had his chance. He missed it.

343
00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.200
Let's hope, for your sake...

344
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.760
my son doesn't find this person first
and he turns out to be the Avatar.

345
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.680
He would return as a hero and,
for all purposes, be your superior.

346
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.200
Well...

347
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.240
I suppose it's a race, then.

348
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.160
We're close, Uncle.

349
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.600
They've been moving
farther and farther north.

350
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.880
We're catching them.

351
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.720
There are a lot of pretty girls
in this town, Zuko.

352
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.960
You could fall in love here.

353
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.160
We could settle down here,
and you could have a blessed life.

354
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.960
We don't have to continue this, Zuko.

355
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.880
I'll show you why we must, Uncle.

356
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.720
Hey...

357
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.400
Little one, come here.

358
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.840
You look like a very smart boy.

359
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.200
Tell me what you know about
the Prince, the Fire Lord's son.

360
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.480
- He did something wrong.
- He spoke out of turn...

361
00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.120
to a general in defense
of some of his friends...

362
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.520
who were going to be sacrificed
in a battle.

363
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.320
Then Prince Zuko was sentenced
to an Agni Kai duel...

364
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.600
but when he showed up,
it was his father he was to fight.

365
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.600
- That's right.
- He would not fight his father.

366
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.320
Then his father mocked him
and said...

367
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.840
"I should bring your sister
up here to beat you."

368
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.760
Then the father burnt his son...

369
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.560
to teach him a lesson.

370
00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.160
We'll catch him soon, Uncle.

371
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.360
Then we can think
about the pretty girls.

372
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.320
Aang...

373
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.160
Try to keep your wrist bent,
like it's showing.

374
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.040
What's wrong?
You've really been distracted today.

375
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.680
I saw Sokka's maps.
We're near the Northern Air Temple.

376
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.120
Do you think it would be okay
if I just visited there...

377
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.600
and came back?

378
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.520
I'd be back in less than a day.

379
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.120
- Why?
- He had a vision...

380
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.320
at the Southern Air Temple
prayer field.

381
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.320
He talked to a Dragon Spirit
who he thinks can help us.

382
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.920
He thinks if he goes
to another spiritual place...

383
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.960
he can get back to the Spirit World.

384
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.000
I don't think that's a good idea.
We started a rebellion.

385
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.600
Try to talk him out of it.

386
00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.680
I can't do this.

387
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.600
I need help.

388
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.680
- I guess your talk didn't work.
- He'll be back in a day.

389
00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.480
The Fire Nation is following us.

390
00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.040
If we make a wrong move,
they'll catch him.

391
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.800
Who are you?

392
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.520
Why, it cannot be!

393
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.680
I've heard stories. Are you?

394
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.920
My name is Aang.

395
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.560
I cannot believe
I've lived to see your return.

396
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.600
I'm an Earth villager, but I visit
these temple remains often.

397
00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.120
The Fire Nation
has destroyed this temple.

398
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.120
- They have ruined everything.
- No, not everything.

399
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.760
You know, there's
a hidden chamber of statues...

400
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.960
I think you, of all people,
should see.

401
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.480
These are all the Avatars.

402
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.720
These are the reincarnations
of you over the years.

403
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.960
The Avatar Roku was your last life.

404
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:10.720
Now, how did the Airbenders know
you were the Avatar, little one?

405
00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.440
They gave me a test.

406
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.920
They put 1,000 toys in front of me
and asked me to choose four.

407
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.720
They said I chose
the same four objects...

408
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.400
that belonged
to the previous Avatars.

409
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.160
That's when they told me
I could have no family.

410
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.360
Told me I had a responsibility
to the Four Nations.

411
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.560
There's a ceremony
when everyone bows to me.

412
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.400
That's when I accept my role
as the Avatar.

413
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.800
But when everyone bowed...

414
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.960
I didn't bow back.

415
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.440
You seem like a nice young man.

416
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.840
You really do.

417
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.840
You will forgive me, won't you?

418
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.760
- For what?
- For luring you down here.

419
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.360
I have lived in poverty
because of your absence, Avatar.

420
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.800
So you will understand
my actions today.

421
00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.680
"I have lived in poverty
because of your absence, Avatar."

422
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:52.800
I have seen a vision
of the moon turning red.

423
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.880
The Fire Nation has stolen knowledge
of us from the Great Library.

424
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.040
They are planning
to misuse this knowledge.

425
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.520
I will stop them.

426
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.560
You must go
to the Northern Water Tribe.

427
00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.200
If they take that city,
more will suffer and die...

428
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.840
as your Airbenders have.

429
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.560
You must go now!

430
00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.680
Will I stop them?

431
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.800
Wake up, young man!

432
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:25.480
My name is Commander Zhao.
I set this trap for you.

433
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.040
Don't worry,
I'm not going to kill you.

434
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.240
Besides, you'd just
be reborn again...

435
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.040
and then the search would continue.

436
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.320
So where have you been all this time?

437
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.880
And how is it that
you're still a boy?

438
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.440
I understand that when you freed
that handful of towns...

439
00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.160
you were very impressive, but...

440
00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.560
you only used Airbending
against my soldiers.

441
00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.440
Now, why is that?

442
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.360
The Fire Lord and I have a plan...

443
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.760
to ensure our reign
and the downfall of our enemies.

444
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.360
I am sending a personal message
to the Fire Lord...

445
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.360
informing him
that the once feared Avatar...

446
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:35.200
is our prisoner
and no threat to our might.

447
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.040
Who are you?

448
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.880
Wait! Don't!

449
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.560
Stop!

450
00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.680
Fools.

451
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.960
Close the inner gates!
The Avatar has escaped!

452
00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.360
Lock down the gate!

453
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.920
Lock down all the gates!

454
00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.400
To the main post!

455
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.280
- This was their practice area.
- Go again!

456
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.720
Do not kill the Avatar!

457
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.320
He will just be reborn again!

458
00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.560
Why are you doing this?
Who are you?

459
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.000
Open the gates.

460
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.200
Let them out!

461
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.400
Is it some kind of Spirit, Commander?

462
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.480
Not at all.

463
00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.520
Do it.

464
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.360
What is this?

465
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.080
And how did he escape?

466
00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.840
I fear that your son...

467
00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.840
is not only incompetent
but also a traitor.

468
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.440
Of course, I cannot prove this, sire.

469
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:09.840
You think...

470
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.200
my son is this person...

471
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.800
the soldiers are calling
the Blue Spirit?

472
00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.360
Yes.

473
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.200
Zhao's men were searching the coast,
looking for you.

474
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.240
They also searched the ship.

475
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.600
I told them you went
on vacation with a girl.

476
00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.000
Where were you the past four days?

477
00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.720
Nowhere.

478
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.960
We have to keep moving.

479
00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.120
The Avatar is traveling again.

480
00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.000
Take rest first.

481
00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.920
It looks like you went through
a great deal.

482
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.840
When you wake,
we'll have tea together...

483
00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.360
before we start the engines.

484
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.680
Do not harm my son.

485
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.280
Leave him to his isolation.

486
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.400
You have my word, sire.
I will not harm him.

487
00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.120
Zuko!

488
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.680
And what of the Avatar?

489
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.360
We assume he has rejoined
with his supporters.

490
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.640
It has been confirmed
that he's traveling north.

491
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.920
It is my strong belief
that he is traveling...

492
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
to the Northern Water Tribe.

493
00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.280
I believe the child Avatar has only
knowledge of his birth element, Air.

494
00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.360
I believe he is trying to learn
in the discipline of water.

495
00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.600
He's gone to seek out someone
in the Northern Water Tribe...

496
00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.216
where they have lived
beyond our reach...

497
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.360
and openly practice Waterbending.

498
00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.080
"We arrived
at the Northern Water Tribe."

499
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.320
"We presented ourselves
to the royal court."

500
00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.840
"My brother and the princess
became friends right away."

501
00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.240
"Aang showed them he was
the last Airbender"...

502
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.480
"and was accepted
to train with the master."

503
00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:13.600
"The city knew our arrival
would bring great danger."

504
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.920
"And they prepared for war they knew
would come in the ensuing weeks."

505
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.680
The city was designed
to withstand any assault.

506
00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.080
If we keep them to the courtyard
and the marketplace...

507
00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.520
till night falls
where we have the advantage...

508
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.760
we will succeed.

509
00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.496
If we let too many of them
into the city...

510
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.760
their sheer numbers
could overwhelm us.

511
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.680
As many fires in this city
should be put out...

512
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.560
as possible when the alarm sounds.

513
00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.200
We want to minimize
their bender sources.

514
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.200
I must assign a guard to be with you
at all times, Princess.

515
00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.680
Your presence is our inspiration.

516
00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.640
I'll do it. That's me.
I'll be her guard.

517
00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.880
Nothing will happen to her.

518
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.280
I had a feeling you might volunteer.

519
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.480
I've heard no word of my son
for quite some time.

520
00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:10.200
- Do you know where he is?
- I've not heard of anything, sire.

521
00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.280
I'm sure word of him
will come to us soon.

522
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.920
The Northern Water Tribe benders
are given their strength...

523
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.680
by the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
They will be difficult to defeat.

524
00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.000
Now, if for some reason
the Spirits were not involved...

525
00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.280
that would be different.

526
00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.880
What have you learned
from the stolen scrolls?

527
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:35.560
We have deciphered the location
of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.

528
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:43.320
It is our destiny to have found
this information, Zhao.

529
00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.200
Eliminate the Spirits...

530
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:53.080
take the city and we will have
thwarted the Avatar in the process.

531
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.240
Water is what?

532
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:09.720
The flowing element.
The element of change.

533
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.880
To master water,
you must release your emotions...

534
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.080
wherever they may lead you.

535
00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.760
Water teaches us acceptance.

536
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:22.120
Let your emotions flow like water.

537
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.600
Aang, would you like to spar?
You haven't sparred in a few days.

538
00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.680
Now, use offense, Aang!

539
00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.520
General Iroh, I'm glad
you could accept my invitation...

540
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.240
to join us on this historic event.

541
00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.400
Your invitation was most gracious.

542
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.960
You are a gifted strategist.
No one can argue that.

543
00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.240
Your failure in the Hundred Day Siege
of Ba Sing Se...

544
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.640
won't be held against you.

545
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.280
Your son died in that siege,
didn't he?

546
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.320
Yes, he did.

547
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.040
Again, I offer my condolences
on your nephew burning to death...

548
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.760
in that terrible accident.

549
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.720
Thank you.

550
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.520
I've loved spending
these weeks with you, Sokka.

551
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.720
Me, too.

552
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.200
Should we see what the ocean
is doing today?

553
00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.160
When there is some safety
for all of us...

554
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.360
I will come visit our sister city
in the Southern Water Tribe...

555
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.680
and spend some time in your home.

556
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.680
That would be great.

557
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.160
But I warn you...

558
00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.960
my grandmother will ask you
a lot of questions.

559
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.560
What might she ask me?

560
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:22.320
She'll say, "Why is your hair white,
young lady? You look very odd."

561
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.840
I would say to your grandmother...

562
00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.400
my hair is white
because when I was born...

563
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.520
I was not awake.

564
00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.800
My mother and father could not get me
to make a sound or move.

565
00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:34.960
So they prayed for days
to the Moon Spirit...

566
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:38.480
and dipped me into the sacred waters.

567
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:45.560
My parents said that my hair turned
white then and life poured into me.

568
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.560
You didn't tell me that.

569
00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.400
You didn't ask me.

570
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.960
Only your grandmother did.

571
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.400
I'm sure Zhao was the one
who ordered the attack on you.

572
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.520
Any problems?

573
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.320
We have arrived at the Northern
Water Tribe's stronghold.

574
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.000
They believe the boy is there.

575
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.680
Why do you seem upset, Uncle?

576
01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.000
Zhao has no sacredness.

577
01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.920
Are you sure you want to be here?

578
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.280
I will not be allowed
to live in peace...

579
01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.840
until I bring the Avatar
to my father!

580
01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.400
Is that not clear to you?

581
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.800
What is this?

582
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.920
Yue...

583
01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.840
the Fire Nation is here.

584
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.720
Now be sure to keep your uniform
closed up to your neck.

585
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.840
And remember, your Chi can warm you.

586
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.160
I know, Uncle.

587
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.240
Be safe.

588
01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.000
Aang needs to ask you something.

589
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.880
I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit.

590
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.920
He can help me
defeat the Fire Nation.

591
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.160
Is there a spiritual place
where I can meditate?

592
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:50.320
There is a very spiritual place.
The city was built around this place.

593
01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.280
But we must hurry.

594
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.760
Momo!

595
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.640
Be nice.

596
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.920
To get your Airbending tattoos...

597
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.920
you have to meditate
for long periods of time...

598
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.080
without losing focus.

599
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.880
Some of the great monks
can meditate for four days.

600
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.600
- I have to get back.
- I'll take you.

601
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.760
I'll stay with him.

602
01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.240
Aang?

603
01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.600
Aang, can you hear me?

604
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.760
I knew you were real.

605
01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.720
I always knew you'd return.

606
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.840
Me, too.

607
01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.040
The Fire Lord's son.

608
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.240
You took him from our village.

609
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.080
Who are you?

610
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.800
My name is Katara...

611
01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.640
and I'm the only Waterbender left
in the Southern Water Tribe.

612
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:29.280
- Go for the children.
- Yes.

613
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.360
I'm not allowed to go home
without him.

614
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.040
The Waterbenders get power
from the moon.

615
01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.400
They will get stronger
as the day comes to an end.

616
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.320
General Iroh,
I've been keeping a secret.

617
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.160
And what is that?

618
01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.560
In my raid of the Great Library
earlier this year...

619
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.680
I found a scroll
that tells the location...

620
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.080
of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.

621
01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.400
To meet a Spirit
would be a great honor.

622
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.080
Well, I hope I can give you
that honor.

623
01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.640
What happened?

624
01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.360
What happened?

625
01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:37.080
Prince Zuko's here in the city.

626
01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.200
He took Aang again.

627
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.840
We'll just wait
till everyone's fighting everyone.

628
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.480
Then in the night, we'll slip out.

629
01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.320
"Aang, can you hear me?"

630
01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.560
"I knew you were real."

631
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.800
"I always knew you'd return."

632
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.280
Hello!

633
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.600
Please, tell me how to beat
the Fire Nation!

634
01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.440
You are not dealing
with the loss of your people...

635
01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.200
and your responsibility
for their deaths.

636
01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.160
You are stopping yourself
from grieving.

637
01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.040
You are angry.

638
01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.000
You must let this go.

639
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:54.160
As the Avatar,
you are not meant to hurt others.

640
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.480
Use the ocean.

641
01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.640
Show them the power of Water.

642
01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.680
Go! Do this now.

643
01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.160
"My sister Azula
was always the special one."

644
01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.280
She was a Firebending prodigy.

645
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.440
My father loves her.

646
01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.280
He can't even look at me sometimes.

647
01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.840
He says I'm like my mother.

648
01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.960
I advise that you pull back
your men soon.

649
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.800
They will be trapped in the city
when the moon's power comes out.

650
01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.880
Do not worry about the moon's power,
General Iroh.

651
01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.976
Why should you not be worried
about the moon's power?

652
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.400
Because your brother,
Fire Lord Ozai, and I...

653
01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.800
have decided it is
in our best interests...

654
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.040
to kill the Moon Spirit.

655
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.680
What?

656
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.320
Calm down. We'll find him.

657
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.200
Are you okay?

658
01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.760
- Did the Spirits tell you anything?
- Yes.

659
01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:57.240
The Dragon Spirit talked to me.
I know what to do.

660
01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.480
Aang, we have to go.

661
01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:26.320
You won't be killed by Waterbenders
if you stay hidden here.

662
01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:29.680
We could be friends, you know.

663
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.960
They're getting stronger.

664
01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.520
This is a scroll
from the Great Library.

665
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.880
This is our map.

666
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.080
Our world is going to change soon,
gentlemen.

667
01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.000
Right there and right there.

668
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.840
See where they're going!
I'll go join the fight!

669
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.280
They are called many names.

670
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.880
Yin and Yang, push and pull.

671
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:52.680
May I introduce you to the mysterious
Ocean and Moon Spirits?

672
01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.480
Why do Spirits take the form
of such benign things?

673
01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.120
It leaves them so vulnerable.

674
01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.160
To teach man kindness and humility.

675
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.840
Commander Zhao...

676
01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.320
there are certain things
humankind should not tamper with.

677
01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.040
The Spirits and the Spirit World
is one of them.

678
01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.000
What are you doing here?

679
01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.000
Stop, Zhao.

680
01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:36.120
The world will go out of balance.
Everyone will be hurt.

681
01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.760
The Fire Nation is too powerful...

682
01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.200
to worry about children's
superstitions, General Iroh.

683
01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.000
Commander Zhao, don't.

684
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.760
We are now the gods!

685
01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.200
No!

686
01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:18.680
Man all battle stations!

687
01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.200
You are too soft, General Iroh.

688
01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.760
He's making fire out of nothing!

689
01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.560
They're breaching the wall!

690
01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.520
To the front!

691
01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.960
"As the Avatar,
you are not meant to hurt others."

692
01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.160
"You must show them
the power of Water."

693
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.800
All is lost.

694
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.440
You have been anointed
by the Moon Spirit.

695
01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:54.760
- He gave me life when I was a child.
- Then there is still a chance.

696
01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.880
You can give your life back
for the Spirit's.

697
01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.040
Don't listen to him,
he's Fire Nation.

698
01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:03.320
Nothing is ever truly lost.

699
01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.000
Is it mine to give back, if I choose?

700
01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.000
There are reasons
each of us are born.

701
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.760
We have to find those reasons.

702
01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.760
This was the reason I was born.

703
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.000
Yue, please.

704
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.040
There is no love without sacrifice.

705
01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.000
Yue, what are you doing?
You don't know what will happen.

706
01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.160
I believe my life force
will leave my body...

707
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.400
- and return to the Moon Spirit.
- And then what?

708
01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.000
My soul will no longer exist
in this form.

709
01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.080
Please don't do this.
There must be another way.

710
01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.560
I can't let you do this.
I'm supposed to protect you.

711
01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.760
My people are dying, Sokka.

712
01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.600
Those who are in charge of others
have a responsibility.

713
01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:53.136
It is time we show the Fire Nation
we believe in our beliefs...

714
01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.480
- as much as they believe in theirs.
- But Yue...

715
01:19:55.560 --> 01:20:00.680
I'm scared.
Don't make me any more scared.

716
01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:05.560
I will miss you more than you know.

717
01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.760
I killed you.

718
01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.600
Come away from him, nephew.

719
01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.800
There are too many soldiers now.

720
01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:50.280
They will never
let you take the Avatar.

721
01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.880
We must leave immediately.

722
01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.560
He wants to fight you
so he can capture you, Zuko.

723
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.680
Walk away!

724
01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.520
Come!

725
01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.080
You stand alone.

726
01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.400
And that has always been
your great mistake.

727
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.120
"Water teaches us acceptance."

728
01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:39.040
"Let your emotions flow like water."

729
01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.840
Aang?

730
01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.640
They want you
to be their Avatar, Aang.

731
01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.600
We all do.

732
01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.936
Our forces in the Northern
Water Tribe...

733
01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.840
have failed to take the city.

734
01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.720
General Zhao was killed in battle
and my brother has become a traitor.

735
01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.920
My son's proven himself a failure.

736
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:30.200
Now, Sozin's Comet...

737
01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.440
is returning in three years.

738
01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.000
It will give all Firebenders...

739
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.040
the ability
of the highest Firebenders...

740
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:41.000
the ability to use their own Chi
to create Fire.

741
01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:44.840
That is the day
we will win this war...

742
01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.280
and prove the Fire Nation's
dominance.

743
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:52.920
Now you must stop the Avatar
from mastering Earth and Fire.

744
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.280
You must give us the time
to get to that day.

745
01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:00.760
Do you accept this
unspeakably important task...

746
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.800
I'm putting in your hands?

747
01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.640
I do, Father.
