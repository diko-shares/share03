10
00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.548
Come, Erik.
Let's dance.

11
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.394
-Erik.
-My little one!

12
00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:09.139
-I'll talk to him.
-Let me try.

13
00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:15.192
Hey, little one!
Are you okay?

14
00:04:15.596 --> 00:04:18.593
Do not you join the dance?
Do not.

15
00:04:18.687 --> 00:04:21.191
-Can you say why?
-Why?

16
00:04:21.192 --> 00:04:23.810
No, no!
What I say is ...

17
00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:26.947
Uncle Mano, I think he
wants to know why dance.

18
00:04:26.948 --> 00:04:29.549
As if he needed
one reason it is not, Erik?

19
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.852
Yes.

20
00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:32.611
There are many more
reasons to dance.

21
00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:34.368
What is my father?

22
00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:38.721
The only way to
is trying to figure out.

23
00:04:38.782 --> 00:04:43.364
Come on, son!
Just one foot after another.

24
00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.625
Nobody will laugh
I promise you.

25
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.071
Come on, climb on my feet.

26
00:05:02.086 --> 00:05:05.211
<i>I do not care 
with what people say </ i></i>

27
00:05:05.892 --> 00:05:10.400
You'll get the hang.
Just need to feel the rhythm.

28
00:05:13.508 --> 00:05:15.664
<i>We are part 
Emperor of the Nation </ i></i>

29
00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.152
Come on, son!
Let's shake this world!

30
00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:22.149
<i> Do It Your Way </ i></i>

31
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.758
<i> Do It Your Way </ i></i>

32
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.383
That's it!
Come on!

33
00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:48.228
It's not funny!

34
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.213
When someone pees
turned upside down?

35
00:05:51.214 --> 00:05:53.351
-I think not!
Are you all right?

36
00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:54.854
Hurt yourself?

37
00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:57.859
My God!
This was ...

38
00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:04.351
Erik! Erik!

39
00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:08.839
Erik!
I'm sorry.

40
00:06:10.442 --> 00:06:12.443
What a champion!

41
00:06:12.444 --> 00:06:14.144
It was not so bad.

42
00:06:14.145 --> 00:06:17.084
When I was your age,
laughed my ass off of me.

43
00:06:17.138 --> 00:06:18.997
They thought I was
weird, too.

44
00:06:18.998 --> 00:06:21.502
I mean different,
know of a cool way!

45
00:06:21.503 --> 00:06:23.866
-Mano.
-You are cool.

46
00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:25.360
-I was cool ...
-Take it easy.

47
00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:28.417
-Very cool.
-Want to know Erik.

48
00:06:28.418 --> 00:06:30.046
When his father came
the hole

49
00:06:30.047 --> 00:06:32.420
he must learn
to stop digging.

50
00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:35.098
Mano!
Want to help me here?

51
00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:36.775
We would never have
one like you.

52
00:06:36.776 --> 00:06:38.279
-No way.
-Take a good reason.

53
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.082
-You quietly.
-You're boring.

54
00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:43.480
-This guy bothering you?
No, he is nobody.

55
00:06:44.683 --> 00:06:47.805
I want to know
what is love.

56
00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.492
Hey, Dude.
-Friend.

57
00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:54.364
I want to show me ...

58
00:06:54.565 --> 00:06:57.508
-Ramon, get out.
-The poor Erik!

59
00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:58.907
-Ramon?
What is it?

60
00:06:58.908 --> 00:07:01.389
We are having a conversation
family with Erik.

61
00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:05.818
So you also zoam
and I do not understand.

62
00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.627
-Friend, please.
-Let me handle this.

63
00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:11.381
No, no, no.
-Let me tell you something.

64
00:07:11.382 --> 00:07:13.033
What is
his best friend

65
00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:15.387
it can not meet
the father and son.

66
00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:20.172
Hello, where are you.
Hello, hello, hello.

67
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:23.477
Look at him here,
know cuddly.

68
00:07:23.478 --> 00:07:28.734
The fact that wild as we
can not be tamed.

69
00:07:29.536 --> 00:07:33.242
-This place sucks!
-Raul, do not be ridiculous.

70
00:07:33.243 --> 00:07:37.463
I will not be, I will return
home to delelândia.

71
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.726
Erik?
Knock, Knock!

72
00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:48.873
Honey, I think he
wants to be alone now.

73
00:07:48.874 --> 00:07:50.969
We can not let it
himself in a hole.

74
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.311
-We take care of him, uncle.
-You can leave!

75
00:07:55.513 --> 00:07:59.378
-Let them get along.
-You are right!

76
00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:01.523
Right!
Let's get out of here!

77
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:06.033
I thought I was a good father.

78
00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:08.787
Goodbye, Emperors!

79
00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:12.743
This incredible Penguin here
you never see.

80
00:08:12.744 --> 00:08:14.447
Never again!

81
00:08:43.942 --> 00:08:46.446
Hey, Atticus!
Snack time.

82
00:08:47.248 --> 00:08:49.117
Erik!

83
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.053
I think they're sleeping.

84
00:08:51.054 --> 00:08:53.057
What jokes!

85
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:55.261
They are not here.

86
00:08:55.363 --> 00:09:00.099
Bo!
Boadicea!

87
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.992
Come on, Atticus!
Stop kidding, where are you?

88
00:09:03.993 --> 00:09:06.255
I know it's
hear me, Atticus?

89
00:09:06.256 --> 00:09:09.861
Gloria, do you think
they could have fled?

90
00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:11.965
Alone, out there?

91
00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:13.869
-Perhaps, followed Ramon.
-Love.

92
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.293
I know, I know, but I need
go look for them, right?

93
00:09:16.294 --> 00:09:19.231
-I will not take.
-Dude, relax.

94
00:09:19.232 --> 00:09:23.529
We will find them and when we find
you solve things.

95
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.910
You're a good father.

96
00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:29.851
I'll be back as soon as possible, right.

97
00:09:53.117 --> 00:09:55.946
-That was a big one.
-I hate when that happens.

98
00:09:55.947 --> 00:09:58.267
Hey, Will, are you?
-Of course I am.

99
00:09:58.268 --> 00:10:00.954
-You can not see.
No, we are all equal.

100
00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:02.277
I do not.

101
00:10:02.278 --> 00:10:05.081
Will we Krill.
We are all born alike.

102
00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:08.225
I'm not Bill, there is only one
like me around the world.

103
00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:10.291
I am a single krill.

104
00:10:11.293 --> 00:10:13.471
-Where you going?
-I'm leaving.

105
00:10:13.472 --> 00:10:16.676
-I want to be free, Bill.
Do not have that to be free.

106
00:10:16.677 --> 00:10:18.677
Come on, let's think
more school.

107
00:10:18.678 --> 00:10:21.444
I'm full of shoals.
We walked into school life.

108
00:10:21.445 --> 00:10:23.516
Sometimes I think
your mind is its own.

109
00:10:23.517 --> 00:10:25.940
Tell me, what is
beyond the school?

110
00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:28.545
More-school.
-And then.

111
00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:31.501
There is nothing beyond the school,
a school are endless.

112
00:10:31.502 --> 00:10:32.810
Everything has an end.

113
00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:35.453
See, I'm here.
And it's not a happy ending.

114
00:10:35.454 --> 00:10:36.912
It makes sense, Bill.

115
00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:40.080
If I swim to the opposite of the school
end up coming ...

116
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:42.160
At the end of the world.

117
00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:47.349
Very well.

118
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.371
I'll count to three.

119
00:10:49.372 --> 00:10:50.674
A. ..

120
00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.077
Two ...

121
00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:53.479
Three ...

122
00:10:55.383 --> 00:10:58.588
No, I can!
I can!

123
00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:00.872
No, not!
Yes, I can!

124
00:11:00.873 --> 00:11:02.976
No, can not.
Who's talking about me?

125
00:11:02.977 --> 00:11:05.481
-Can not.
Who is ...

126
00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:14.426
Let's mess!
Let's mess!

127
00:11:14.427 --> 00:11:16.029
Today, let's mess!
Today, let's mess!

128
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.532
It's all-din!
It's all-din!

129
00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:19.736
Today, let's mess!
Today, let's mess!

130
00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:23.032
What is this?

131
00:11:23.033 --> 00:11:25.414
Let's go delelândia.
-No way.

132
00:11:25.415 --> 00:11:27.455
We will not without their parents,
This is kidnapping.

133
00:11:27.456 --> 00:11:28.858
Now, get out!

134
00:11:28.859 --> 00:11:31.881
-We can not, we fugivos.
Flee-what?

135
00:11:31.882 --> 00:11:34.987
-Fugitive.
-The nest of the emperors.

136
00:11:34.988 --> 00:11:36.991
No happy-feet.
What?

137
00:11:37.092 --> 00:11:39.200
No happy-feet.
-What do you ...?

138
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:41.687
We are rebellious ago
of emotion and adventure.

139
00:11:41.688 --> 00:11:44.504
E-tasty snacks.
Thank you.

140
00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:46.296
This guy ...
All right!

141
00:11:46.297 --> 00:11:48.199
I want to finish soon.

142
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.404
And those crustaceans, known
those little ones who do ...

143
00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:53.008
Yes.

144
00:11:56.666 --> 00:11:59.814
We do not know swimming,
others have fluff.

145
00:11:59.815 --> 00:12:01.917
What?
Fur-sinks.

146
00:12:01.918 --> 00:12:04.358
More is too high.
I have acrophobia.

147
00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:06.963
Dude, the water is right there,
right there!

148
00:12:06.964 --> 00:12:09.667
I do not care!
It's too cold for me!

149
00:12:09.668 --> 00:12:13.802
Atticus, for.
He is eating his wing.

150
00:12:13.803 --> 00:12:16.140
Okay.
Let's do this.

151
00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:18.344
Count to three.
Push me in two.

152
00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:20.107
But do not let me know.

153
00:12:20.108 --> 00:12:22.647
One, two ...

154
00:12:23.483 --> 00:12:25.151
Why pushed me.

155
00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.857
Cute penguins.
But cruel.

156
00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.925
Will! Will!

157
00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:37.167
-What are we looking for?
-This is where're my friend.

158
00:12:37.168 --> 00:12:38.670
I do not know.

159
00:12:38.671 --> 00:12:41.733
Will, please come back.
I fear the worst.

160
00:12:41.734 --> 00:12:43.337
Also I fear the worst.

161
00:12:43.338 --> 00:12:46.883
Why fear the best
is a waste of time.

162
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:50.389
Here!

163
00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.196
Maybe it's a black hole.

164
00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:58.097
Stop it.
It keeps you in school.

165
00:12:58.098 --> 00:13:01.397
Came out of nowhere.
Swallows everything in its path.

166
00:13:01.398 --> 00:13:04.419
For something that does not exist
is quite impressive!

167
00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:30.914
It's beautiful!

168
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.296
Uncle, Ramon?

169
00:13:53.746 --> 00:13:56.950
Children, take me
home.

170
00:14:00.957 --> 00:14:03.059
So this is all we are.

171
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.663
Food.

172
00:14:04.664 --> 00:14:08.092
And we think that a lifetime
without knowing the truth.

173
00:14:08.493 --> 00:14:10.834
Criel Goodbye world!

174
00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:16.528
Erik.

175
00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:18.331
Boadicea.

176
00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:21.637
Aticcus.

177
00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:31.151
Ramon.

178
00:14:49.395 --> 00:14:53.865
You see!
It is the main event of the females.

179
00:14:53.866 --> 00:14:55.427
I'm about
being thrown to the ground

180
00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:58.015
and crushed
for thousands of Ticas.

181
00:14:58.016 --> 00:15:03.110
Rejoice Ticas,
the emperor has returned!

182
00:15:06.082 --> 00:15:08.718
Ignored by thousands.

183
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.322
The emperor returned!

184
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.087
I have so much love
overflows.

185
00:15:19.097 --> 00:15:24.137
-Ramon, live!
How long!

186
00:15:24.138 --> 00:15:25.902
I thought I had not left.

187
00:15:27.124 --> 00:15:29.278
Ramon has twins?

188
00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.482
There are only three.

189
00:15:31.483 --> 00:15:33.633
Children, friends.
Friends, children.

190
00:15:33.634 --> 00:15:35.737
-That cute.
Where, "las Ticas"?

191
00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:38.433
-Las Ticas Ramon.
-You were gone.

192
00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:42.423
-The competition grew, brother.
-For me it's impossible!

193
00:15:52.915 --> 00:15:55.832
The old-Lover.
-It is completely different.

194
00:15:55.833 --> 00:15:57.640
He looks like a rainbow.

195
00:15:57.641 --> 00:15:59.844
He looks like a rainbow
with tits.

196
00:15:59.845 --> 00:16:01.535
-Ramon.
Very well!

197
00:16:03.551 --> 00:16:06.425
Brothers and sisters!

198
00:16:06.426 --> 00:16:08.729
All penguins!

199
00:16:09.222 --> 00:16:14.934
Whether it is large,
no matter how small.

200
00:16:15.236 --> 00:16:17.697
We are here today!

201
00:16:18.098 --> 00:16:22.447
To see a penguin
extraordinary!

202
00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.839
Without a doubt!

203
00:16:25.642 --> 00:16:27.443
It ...

204
00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:29.347
The powerful Sven!

205
00:16:29.348 --> 00:16:33.843
-Sven!
-Sven!

206
00:16:36.558 --> 00:16:40.563
He is on top,
for now.

207
00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:58.923
A penguin that can fly.

208
00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:13.714
The Lord then,
will be crashing.

209
00:17:18.304 --> 00:17:20.825
Tell us brother
his testimony.

210
00:17:20.826 --> 00:17:23.827
My friends
is a long history ...

211
00:17:23.828 --> 00:17:25.832
Then resume soon!

212
00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:27.762
It begins with a story ...

213
00:17:27.763 --> 00:17:30.714
Its beak is larger
his head.

214
00:17:30.715 --> 00:17:33.448
-Get ...
-Security!

215
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.632
And are still talking.

216
00:17:41.634 --> 00:17:43.484
We're still here
for you, brother.

217
00:17:43.485 --> 00:17:46.690
-Go ahead.
-All right.

218
00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:50.474
It starts with a loss ...

219
00:17:50.475 --> 00:17:53.764
No, no, no.
Sorry for the moment passed.

220
00:17:53.765 --> 00:17:56.402
I forgot what I was going to say,
maybe tomorrow.

221
00:17:56.603 --> 00:18:01.012
No, I'm sorry!
Is not flowing, the show is over!

222
00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.814
-Please, sir.
What?

223
00:18:04.197 --> 00:18:07.761
Their story is about flight?

224
00:18:07.762 --> 00:18:12.052
-Where are you?
-From the land of the emperors.

225
00:18:12.053 --> 00:18:13.910
And what's your name?

226
00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:16.001
Erik.

227
00:18:16.703 --> 00:18:19.434
In Insvelândia had many
brave warriors

228
00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:20.938
Erik called.

229
00:18:20.939 --> 00:18:23.497
-Seriously.
Yes, of course.

230
00:18:26.818 --> 00:18:31.509
Everyone!
Your attention, please.

231
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.984
I dedicate my comforting
much celebrated saga

232
00:18:35.985 --> 00:18:39.323
to my brave friend, Erik.

233
00:18:39.324 --> 00:18:41.517
Erik!

234
00:18:42.595 --> 00:18:44.699
Erik!

235
00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:47.028
Erik!

236
00:18:57.398 --> 00:19:00.698
It begins with a story ...

237
00:19:00.699 --> 00:19:03.172
From my home!

238
00:19:03.173 --> 00:19:05.996

Penguin Race </ i></i>

Sorry, sorry.

258
00:20:07.493 --> 00:20:10.714
It's okay.
Do not hold the emotion.

259
00:20:10.715 --> 00:20:12.992
Loving is fine.

260
00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:20.362

Erik!

271
00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:19.291
<i>And when he tried 
speak their language </ i></i>

272
00:21:19.292 --> 00:21:21.203
What a wonderful aroma
wonderful is that?

<i>Sven felt something bigger 
to search for </ i></i>

274
00:21:25.912 --> 00:21:33.046
<i> Who knows what he saw
that mystical light </ i></i>

275
00:21:47.148 --> 00:21:50.519
-I saw our future.
What?

276
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.643
-He came to me.
-Seriously.

277
00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:55.914
He said
"Sven go through there fast!"

278
00:21:55.915 --> 00:21:57.418
I'll go with you.

279
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:06.385
<i>But he lacked  fly.
Sven-</ i></i>

280
00:22:06.887 --> 00:22:10.875

282
00:22:18.162 --> 00:22:20.744
-What is this?
-It is amazing.

283
00:22:20.745 --> 00:22:22.675
-Seriously, never saw it.
Do not.

284
00:22:22.676 --> 00:22:24.961
-Is the green.
-Green!

285
00:22:24.962 --> 00:22:28.860
Brothers and sisters,
behold the power of Sven.

286
00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:35.973
On that day
I made an oath.

287
00:22:35.974 --> 00:22:37.729
Sven ... I

288
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.843
I promise to use my powers
only for good things.

289
00:22:42.913 --> 00:22:46.451
For eternity
all the time, to create ...

290
00:22:46.452 --> 00:22:49.572
eter a new ...

291
00:23:09.629 --> 00:23:15.068
Is there no end
to the power of Sven?

292
00:23:17.747 --> 00:23:21.578
-Will you marry me!
No, marry me!

293
00:23:22.891 --> 00:23:26.647
-Will you marry me!
-Will you marry me!

294
00:23:27.061 --> 00:23:28.641
What jokes ...

295
00:23:28.644 --> 00:23:33.542
But if I love some,
who love girls.

296
00:23:33.543 --> 00:23:36.346
They love you.
And who will love Ramon?

297
00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:40.895
Someone, either.
No one.

298
00:23:40.896 --> 00:23:42.598
Have you?

299
00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:45.518
Dude, bitter,
lonely and selfish.

300
00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:48.182
You need to learn
to think like Sven.

301
00:23:48.183 --> 00:23:51.016
-Why?
-If you want, you have to want.

302
00:23:51.017 --> 00:23:53.621
If you want to be yours!

303
00:23:53.622 --> 00:23:56.993
"SvenPense"
belongs to me.

304
00:23:56.994 --> 00:23:59.298
Did you know that a close
look like a fool.

305
00:23:59.299 --> 00:24:01.834
Sure, SvenPense.

306
00:24:01.835 --> 00:24:05.339
-SvenPense!
-SvenPense!

307
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.643
-Enough!
-License, I'm going through.

308
00:24:07.644 --> 00:24:09.646
Prove what does not.

309
00:24:09.647 --> 00:24:11.521
All right!
Now, listen.

310
00:24:11.542 --> 00:24:13.170
-And clear your mind.
-Done.

311
00:24:13.171 --> 00:24:15.430
And imagine your goal.

312
00:24:15.431 --> 00:24:18.211
-Right.
And see-blue eyes.

313
00:24:18.212 --> 00:24:19.966
-Blonde, blondes are.
-Low.

314
00:24:19.967 --> 00:24:21.300
-High.
-Taiwan.

315
00:24:21.301 --> 00:24:23.704
-Sexy.
-Whatever, just like.

316
00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:25.947
Wish hard,
we want by force.

317
00:24:25.948 --> 00:24:28.978
Now stronger,
we want.

318
00:24:32.911 --> 00:24:34.786
-Ramon!
-Close your eyes.

319
00:24:34.787 --> 00:24:36.990
-Where are the children?
-Security!

320
00:24:45.059 --> 00:24:48.446
You, me for one another.

321
00:24:48.447 --> 00:24:51.988
You and me, no chance!

322
00:24:51.989 --> 00:24:54.443
I have a chance,
she said no way.

323
00:24:54.444 --> 00:24:56.744
Carmen, I think he
stick to your foot.

324
00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:59.437
Carmen, her name is carmen.

325
00:24:59.438 --> 00:25:03.598
Sven, you'll be mine
best friend and my godfather.

326
00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:05.848
-And then, my friend.
-I'm going through.

327
00:25:09.616 --> 00:25:11.495
Calm boy
Erik is his son?

328
00:25:11.496 --> 00:25:13.838
Yes, it is.
Children, let's go.

329
00:25:13.839 --> 00:25:15.963
Uncle Bud, it's not fair.

330
00:25:15.964 --> 00:25:19.836
Come on you all.
-But this place is so fun.

331
00:25:20.138 --> 00:25:21.902
Erik, come on.

332
00:25:21.906 --> 00:25:23.950
Not return to
the land of the emperors.

333
00:25:23.951 --> 00:25:25.906
Do not be silly.
-I will be here.

334
00:25:25.907 --> 00:25:27.487
But it's personal
at home.

335
00:25:27.489 --> 00:25:29.329
His mother must be
very worried.

336
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.024
Erik, you better do
what your father says.

337
00:25:33.226 --> 00:25:35.229
But I do not like it there.

338
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.570
Oh, little one, I'll
tell you a secret, right.

339
00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:42.974
Sometimes when
you are a little different

340
00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:44.777
the world laughs at you.

341
00:25:44.778 --> 00:25:46.080
-Right.
-Yes.

342
00:25:46.081 --> 00:25:48.998
Think you are funny,
pointed wings.

343
00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:52.559
We have a saying
Insvelândia there.

344
00:25:56.391 --> 00:26:00.875
Believe in yourself Erik
Sven because they believe in you.

345
00:26:02.264 --> 00:26:04.471
Can I ask?
-Yes.

346
00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:06.955
I can fly?

347
00:26:06.956 --> 00:26:10.509
-Erik, please.
-The boy seeks the larger truth.

348
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.945
If you want,
must desire.

349
00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:16.328
If you wish,
all you want is yours.

350
00:26:16.729 --> 00:26:19.858
Now, go.

351
00:26:33.328 --> 00:26:34.831
Bye!

352
00:26:37.523 --> 00:26:39.625
Bye!

353
00:26:47.286 --> 00:26:49.690
Son. Erik.

354
00:26:50.092 --> 00:26:55.044
You know, when everything goes wrong
running away is not the solution.

355
00:26:55.045 --> 00:26:56.447
Okay.

356
00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:59.694
Need to find itself
a way to solve.

357
00:26:59.695 --> 00:27:01.116
-Right.
-All right.

358
00:27:01.418 --> 00:27:03.497
And we are all different

359
00:27:03.498 --> 00:27:07.130
part of life to know who is
and what their gifts.

360
00:27:07.432 --> 00:27:11.261
You can not dance or fly
but when you discover

361
00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:13.194
is all yours.

362
00:27:13.195 --> 00:27:14.708
Got it?

363
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.114
Yes, that's okay.

364
00:27:19.412 --> 00:27:21.115
Great.

365
00:27:32.395 --> 00:27:36.759
-Will, what is this?
It's the wave of change.

366
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:40.966
The world is changing, Bill.
We have to get in on.

367
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.493
My god,
can not be.

368
00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.662
Something somewhere
gave the greatest hustle.

369
00:28:28.164 --> 00:28:31.521
Something hit the
land of the emperors.

370
00:28:31.538 --> 00:28:34.506
Come on, children.
Let's push the pace.

371
00:28:36.255 --> 00:28:38.523
-It's our time, Bill.
-Right.

372
00:28:38.524 --> 00:28:41.924
Swimming-and-death, my friend.
-Swimming?

373
00:28:41.925 --> 00:28:43.765
Can not know
what we become.

374
00:28:43.766 --> 00:28:45.938
Beauty, eat plankton
the rest of your life.

375
00:28:45.939 --> 00:28:47.829
But that's what we are,
are herbivores.

376
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.433
-We are vegetarians.
What?

377
00:28:49.434 --> 00:28:51.396
For everyone
devour us.

378
00:28:51.397 --> 00:28:54.223
I am no longer so
to be on the menu.

379
00:28:54.224 --> 00:28:56.502
-Where you going?
-Go up the food chain.

380
00:28:56.503 --> 00:28:57.904
Food chain?

381
00:28:57.905 --> 00:29:00.328
I chew something
that has "Face."

382
00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:08.632
I do not remember that.

383
00:29:08.633 --> 00:29:11.492
It always seems that everything
different in the back.

384
00:29:11.493 --> 00:29:13.613
So I think we should
go the other way.

385
00:29:13.614 --> 00:29:15.741
The land of emperors
is opposite.

386
00:29:15.742 --> 00:29:17.340
Why not go there.

387
00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:20.535
No, no, this is better.
-But shortcuts are shorter.

388
00:29:20.536 --> 00:29:23.759
Not always.
What is, is not that far.

389
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.564
Guys, stop.

390
00:29:27.867 --> 00:29:30.806
Erik, I had to stop.

391
00:29:33.561 --> 00:29:36.285
Okay.
Okay.

392
00:29:36.887 --> 00:29:41.294
Continue, but pay attention
and go slowly.

393
00:29:45.601 --> 00:29:48.605
It is best not to look
down, okay.

394
00:29:49.831 --> 00:29:52.277
Atticus, what I said.

395
00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:57.002
Good day, a champion!
Where to go?

396
00:29:57.003 --> 00:29:58.679
In-house.
-It is.

397
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.182
Me too.

398
00:30:00.854 --> 00:30:04.540
If you can go
slightly backward

399
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:06.044
shake it to pass.

400
00:30:06.045 --> 00:30:09.265
That I can not
befriend, retreat.

401
00:30:09.266 --> 00:30:11.450
Running the beach
not up to anyone.

402
00:30:11.451 --> 00:30:13.417
Maybe move to the other side.

403
00:30:13.418 --> 00:30:16.001
Do not have this side.
-And what have we got here.

404
00:30:16.002 --> 00:30:18.283
Then they will have to return everything.

405
00:30:18.284 --> 00:30:20.256
I am with children
it's kind of dangerous.

406
00:30:20.257 --> 00:30:22.477
I know.
-And we need to get home.

407
00:30:22.478 --> 00:30:25.987
I understand, very fair.
But understand my side, champion.

408
00:30:25.988 --> 00:30:28.358
One day I will have to protect
my thing.

409
00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:31.186
Because someone will want to
take it from me.

410
00:30:31.187 --> 00:30:33.915
When I see,
the whole world will see.

411
00:30:33.916 --> 00:30:37.083
And in the background of consciousness
I have a cruel reminder.

412
00:30:37.084 --> 00:30:39.282
Once I stepped
for a penguin.

413
00:30:39.283 --> 00:30:41.804
He looked at me,
is gone.

414
00:30:41.805 --> 00:30:44.833
Goodbye, girls,
hello empty beach.

415
00:30:44.834 --> 00:30:46.637
-Got it.
Yes, more ...

416
00:30:46.638 --> 00:30:48.240
So get out my face!

417
00:30:48.241 --> 00:30:52.735
My mother says that every obstacle
is an opportunity.

418
00:30:52.736 --> 00:30:54.158
What?

419
00:30:57.067 --> 00:31:02.859
Dude, can apologize,
or I'll break your nose!

420
00:31:04.824 --> 00:31:07.428
-He did not want to do this.
-All right.

421
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.291
And I still know.

422
00:31:09.292 --> 00:31:12.042
- "SvenPense."
-Erik, no.

423
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.305
His chubby flabby,
out of my way.

424
00:31:21.906 --> 00:31:24.614
-Erik.
-Dad!

425
00:31:24.615 --> 00:31:27.853
Where are you Dad?
Where did he go?

426
00:31:29.376 --> 00:31:32.114
-It is not healthy.
Are you all right?

427
00:31:32.115 --> 00:31:34.191
I've been better.

428
00:31:35.974 --> 00:31:38.177
Daddy, what is
doing down there?

429
00:31:38.178 --> 00:31:41.460
Go back to here.
I do not know if I can.

430
00:31:41.461 --> 00:31:44.780
There's a way.
More you do not like.

431
00:31:45.581 --> 00:31:47.684
Do you want
I pull back, right?

432
00:31:47.685 --> 00:31:49.788
Hurry up,
you can.

433
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:52.183
Least we will not like
from you, Dad.

434
00:31:52.184 --> 00:31:57.379
Well, I presume
technically is a tactical retreat,

435
00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.432
I think it will
just a bit.

436
00:32:01.143 --> 00:32:03.546
-Yeah, Dad.
-It is going well.

437
00:32:03.647 --> 00:32:05.649
-It.
Volta. That's right.

438
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.601
To me, this
is nothing normal.

439
00:32:08.602 --> 00:32:11.657
Now see if you can
turn to the other side.

440
00:32:11.658 --> 00:32:13.668
-All right.
-Use the flippers.

441
00:32:15.012 --> 00:32:17.015
-Stop!
Do not.

442
00:32:17.265 --> 00:32:20.189
Come on, Dad,
you can.

443
00:32:28.128 --> 00:32:31.780
Dad,
hear me, Dad?

444
00:32:34.499 --> 00:32:36.801
Shyne, Darren!

445
00:32:36.802 --> 00:32:40.495
-Dad!
I want you to be strong.

446
00:32:40.496 --> 00:32:44.112
I know I will.
Because you never let me down.

447
00:32:44.113 --> 00:32:46.315
Penguin, still there?

448
00:32:46.316 --> 00:32:48.719
Yes, right here.

449
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.073
You can leave them at home
safe with her mother?

450
00:32:52.074 --> 00:32:54.547
-Daddy, what are you talking about?
-What are you talking about?

451
00:32:54.548 --> 00:32:56.599
Sorry, kids.

452
00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.188
The career of his father
came to an end.

453
00:33:00.189 --> 00:33:02.107
No, Dad.
No, Dad.

454
00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:07.504
Let's take a look around.
Can you see any way out?

455
00:33:08.206 --> 00:33:10.774
Yes, only creating
a pair of wings.

456
00:33:10.775 --> 00:33:14.721
-Can you move?
-I'm stuck, pal.

457
00:33:15.923 --> 00:33:18.884
Okay, everybody,
move away from the edge

458
00:33:18.885 --> 00:33:20.824
we depart
the edge.

459
00:33:20.825 --> 00:33:23.486
Okay, do not move
until I return.

460
00:33:23.487 --> 00:33:25.059
Where you going?

461
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.187
I'll see what I can do
by their father.

462
00:33:27.188 --> 00:33:28.863
What can he do?

463
00:33:28.864 --> 00:33:32.298
He's just an ordinary penguin.

464
00:33:49.975 --> 00:33:53.249
This is another small step
for a krill.

465
00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:56.362
A great leap
invertebrate without a cord.

466
00:33:56.363 --> 00:33:58.421
Holy mother of krill!

467
00:33:58.422 --> 00:34:01.877
How is your appetite, Bill?
He is great?

468
00:34:12.871 --> 00:34:15.376
-What do you think you're doing?
Armando-strike.

469
00:34:15.377 --> 00:34:17.708
Can not ...

470
00:34:17.709 --> 00:34:20.196
You do not give boat
you're a krill.

471
00:34:20.197 --> 00:34:22.400
-We have to evolve, Bill.
Progressing ...

472
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:25.951
Out of nowhere, took millions
years to get here.

473
00:34:26.058 --> 00:34:30.059
Watch and learn, little brother!
I will use natural selection.

474
00:34:30.261 --> 00:34:31.995
No, no, no.

475
00:34:37.066 --> 00:34:40.532
The taste
is very aromatic.

476
00:34:40.533 --> 00:34:43.482
You bit his ass,
do not let go his head.

477
00:34:43.483 --> 00:34:46.007
Instead I'll climb
on his head.

478
00:34:46.008 --> 00:34:48.011
-It is now!
Forward-up, my friend.

479
00:34:48.012 --> 00:34:50.515
New delights,
await us.

480
00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:16.256
Penguin, are you?

481
00:35:36.769 --> 00:35:38.472
Penguin.

482
00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:45.192
Bravely go where
was never a krill.

483
00:35:45.193 --> 00:35:47.521
We become legend, Bill.

484
00:35:47.522 --> 00:35:50.547
That something important!
How much longer?

485
00:35:50.549 --> 00:35:51.980
It's close.

486
00:35:52.382 --> 00:35:55.046
Hey, you idiot!

487
00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:04.089
Are you the licks kelp!

488
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:13.274
I guess I was wrong
I thought you were ...

489
00:36:13.275 --> 00:36:16.147
a cruel machine
to kill.

490
00:36:17.287 --> 00:36:19.577
Want to try a penguin?

491
00:36:19.578 --> 00:36:22.461
Back, Bill.
The animal will pick up!

492
00:36:44.555 --> 00:36:47.384
He's a warrior!
But soon, he will fall,

493
00:36:47.385 --> 00:36:49.593
he is seeing
death in the face.

494
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.875
Good morning, handsome.
I'm sorry.

495
00:37:09.976 --> 00:37:11.878
It was a mistake.

496
00:37:25.113 --> 00:37:28.761
-Boys.
-Father worked.

497
00:37:29.523 --> 00:37:31.395
SvenPense!

498
00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:40.157
He saw his eyes,
all terrified.

499
00:37:40.158 --> 00:37:41.576
You said he was.

500
00:37:41.577 --> 00:37:43.501
I chose to save
that poor life.

501
00:37:43.502 --> 00:37:45.009
What?
-He will tell their friends,

502
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.414
spread terror.
There's a new predator in the area.

503
00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:51.389
-You're crazy!
-Someone needs to control

504
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:54.371
the number of individuals of
species. -I deserve.

505
00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.749
<i> We are the champions
My friends </ i></i>

506
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.442
<i>And we'll keep fighting 
until the end </ i></i>

507
00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:01.550
<i>If -sees!
-I am the champion! </ I></i>

508
00:38:01.551 --> 00:38:03.919
<i>-Am champion!
It's a musical delight. </ I></i>

509
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.814
Will is the first sign
of madness.

510
00:38:05.815 --> 00:38:08.154
<i>We  champion </ i></i>

511
00:38:08.344 --> 00:38:10.658
-How is the shoulder?
-Okay.

512
00:38:10.659 --> 00:38:12.638
Boot a little ice
it improves.

513
00:38:12.639 --> 00:38:14.863
Thank you.
No, I thank you.

514
00:38:14.864 --> 00:38:16.400
Thank you, friend.

515
00:38:16.401 --> 00:38:19.248
Brian, the king of the beach,
will have another season.

516
00:38:19.249 --> 00:38:21.716
That made you a friend
of elephant seals.

517
00:38:21.717 --> 00:38:23.056
As we speak, children?

518
00:38:23.057 --> 00:38:26.854
Thank you, buddy
to bring Daddy back.

519
00:38:26.855 --> 00:38:29.389
-I owe you, my friend.
-Health, Brian.

520
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:33.200
No, I mean it.
You only need to ask.

521
00:38:33.201 --> 00:38:38.095
Anytime, anywhere,
just call beauty.

522
00:38:38.096 --> 00:38:41.107
-Only call.
-Right.

523
00:38:41.408 --> 00:38:44.786
Let puppies,
time to go home.

524
00:38:45.605 --> 00:38:47.265
Come on, Erik.

525
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:49.705
Come on, children.

526
00:39:03.229 --> 00:39:06.478
-We are lost, is not it?
-Atticus, we are not lost.

527
00:39:06.479 --> 00:39:08.629
The land of emperors
should be right here.

528
00:39:10.945 --> 00:39:12.460
You are crazy,

529
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:16.332
I'm sure the land of
emperors is there.

530
00:39:16.433 --> 00:39:18.221
Not here.

531
00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:22.041
My God!

532
00:39:23.144 --> 00:39:25.311
Then, no!

533
00:39:35.142 --> 00:39:37.395
Look, someone got out.

534
00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:39.350
They saw, I knew
there was a way out.

535
00:39:39.351 --> 00:39:42.381
-Friend, how we get out?
I do not know.

536
00:39:42.382 --> 00:39:45.896
-I am trying to get.
-Mano, Mano!

537
00:39:45.897 --> 00:39:48.510
-Hey, Dad!
-Atticus, my good boy

538
00:39:48.511 --> 00:39:51.120
-See you all well.
What happened?

539
00:39:51.121 --> 00:39:55.150
A huge iceberg came tumbling
and rolling and here we are.

540
00:39:55.151 --> 00:39:56.729
This is terrible.

541
00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.686
Nothing that would not
to give way, baby.

542
00:39:58.687 --> 00:40:01.451
-Mama!
-I told everyone to relax.

543
00:40:01.452 --> 00:40:04.312
-For he knew they were good.
-Where's Mommy?

544
00:40:04.313 --> 00:40:06.617
Has anyone seen the glory?

545
00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:09.937
Mano, Erik!

546
00:40:10.338 --> 00:40:11.841
Mother!
-Glory!

547
00:40:11.842 --> 00:40:14.616
My beautiful boys, I
you never see them.

548
00:40:14.617 --> 00:40:16.618
We have to find a way
to take you there.

549
00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:18.658
Honey, everyone is
looking for a way out.

550
00:40:18.659 --> 00:40:21.067
If there is an exit,
we'll find.

551
00:40:21.068 --> 00:40:22.436
Do not worry, Dad.

552
00:40:22.437 --> 00:40:25.742
Today, the Uncle Mano took
an enormous elephant seal

553
00:40:25.743 --> 00:40:27.645
a large black hole.

554
00:40:28.047 --> 00:40:31.061
But that hole
was quite different.

555
00:40:31.062 --> 00:40:32.690
-But he drew.
-Mano,

556
00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:34.995
can bring a fish
for my children.

557
00:40:34.996 --> 00:40:36.797
-For me, too.
-Here, too.

558
00:40:36.798 --> 00:40:39.520
Okay,
will do my best.

559
00:40:47.358 --> 00:40:49.989
Hey, listen!

560
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.397
There's a way of freeing
almost all of you.

561
00:40:52.398 --> 00:40:56.546
I'm going to delelândia,
I'll bring some friends.

562
00:40:56.547 --> 00:40:59.205
Will be
patients, all right.

563
00:41:00.187 --> 00:41:01.710
Where you going?

564
00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:04.093
-I take a shortcut.
-Of course not.

565
00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:06.697
-You will be right here.
-But I'm quick.

566
00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:09.590
-Erik.
-Walk away, she is an athlete.

567
00:41:10.302 --> 00:41:12.906
Sorry, Erik,
I will go faster.

568
00:41:12.907 --> 00:41:15.449
Boadicea!
Which girl impossible!

569
00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.471
I'm impossible even.

570
00:41:17.472 --> 00:41:20.427
-Then, boot to break, girl.
-Yay!

571
00:41:20.428 --> 00:41:23.483
But Ms. Viola, there
many dangers along the way.

572
00:41:23.484 --> 00:41:27.726
Hazard-no, challenges.
-As soon as it comes.

573
00:41:28.629 --> 00:41:31.540
Okay,
find Uncle Ramon ...

574
00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:35.119
Send him to bring friends,
Adélie how he can.

575
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.363
-Is ...
Do not forget the family motto.

576
00:41:38.364 --> 00:41:41.372
The RE-MASH.

577
00:41:55.364 --> 00:41:59.200
Come on, Uncle Bud,
we have too many fish to catch.

578
00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:26.413
-So, what news?
-Ruins.

579
00:42:26.414 --> 00:42:30.011
Every corner, every direction,
completely blocked.

580
00:42:30.012 --> 00:42:33.916
There are rumors of people
thinking the unthinkable.

581
00:42:34.017 --> 00:42:36.820
Noah, are calling
The Iceberg's End.

582
00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:39.023
-How to answer this?
-We will try again.

583
00:42:39.024 --> 00:42:42.228
-We can not ... Return-
to seek hundred times.

584
00:42:42.229 --> 00:42:44.111
-There is no escape.
-Thousands of times

585
00:42:44.112 --> 00:42:46.672
if necessary,
there is always a way out.

586
00:42:46.673 --> 00:42:49.380
It does have, and right there.

587
00:42:49.482 --> 00:42:54.937
Ice, no ice, but it has ice
tone and testing ...

588
00:42:58.355 --> 00:43:00.357
Let me help you.

589
00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:04.530
Ready, you can go.

590
00:43:05.478 --> 00:43:08.737
Erik, no!

591
00:43:08.738 --> 00:43:11.267
Bounce!

592
00:43:19.538 --> 00:43:21.321
You saw, you saw?

593
00:43:21.322 --> 00:43:23.467
Never,
do it again.

594
00:43:23.474 --> 00:43:25.898
Father, I flew!

595
00:43:25.899 --> 00:43:27.800
-Erik.
-I flew!

596
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:30.108
I beat my wings,
was very quick.

597
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:32.762
-And I went up.
-Son, we are penguins

598
00:43:32.763 --> 00:43:35.476
-We can not fly.
-But Sven is a penguin.

599
00:43:35.477 --> 00:43:38.526
I do not know what type of penguin
Sven is, but penguins are

600
00:43:38.528 --> 00:43:41.508
Emperor, we can not ...
-If I learn to fly

601
00:43:41.509 --> 00:43:44.252
Mom can get out of there.

602
00:43:44.813 --> 00:43:47.657
I do not know
if there is a way out.

603
00:43:48.911 --> 00:43:51.839
Erik, surely,
is not flying.

604
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.296
If you want you must desire
and if you want

605
00:43:54.297 --> 00:43:57.870
-What is your wish!
-Erik, get real.

606
00:43:57.871 --> 00:44:00.173
They are trapped.

607
00:44:00.174 --> 00:44:03.387
They are hungry and afraid.

608
00:44:03.516 --> 00:44:07.819
The last thing we need
is false hope.

609
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.625
-Boys?
-Then all will die.

610
00:44:11.626 --> 00:44:14.620
Boys, what's the problem
with you two?

611
00:44:15.755 --> 00:44:18.259
It's just a conversation.
-Erik?

612
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.875
We need a mother's love.
It will explode.

613
00:44:22.876 --> 00:44:26.746
Dude, why will not
catch a few more fish?

614
00:44:26.847 --> 00:44:29.650
He is not hungry,
Aunt Gloria.

615
00:44:29.651 --> 00:44:33.608
Yeah beauty, Atticus, I know,
I understand.

616
00:44:34.813 --> 00:44:36.324
I'm going fishing.

617
00:44:36.325 --> 00:44:39.111
Erik, stop with this anger.

618
00:44:39.413 --> 00:44:41.526
Calm down, Erik.

619
00:44:41.527 --> 00:44:45.516
Honey, take a step
back.

620
00:44:46.576 --> 00:44:48.520
Close your eyes ...

621
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.889
Take a deep breath ...

622
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:53.895
Come on, snap!

623
00:44:56.278 --> 00:44:59.210

656
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:54.261
-I asleep?
-Yes, I was.

657
00:47:54.262 --> 00:47:58.095
So wake up and I say, that
is a school or am I dreaming?

658
00:47:58.096 --> 00:48:00.098
You're dreaming.

659
00:48:09.591 --> 00:48:14.475
-Wonderful!
-Is it edible?

660
00:48:20.098 --> 00:48:23.703
Do not miss those
millions of tiny?

661
00:48:23.704 --> 00:48:26.631
I do not have any condition
create as many children.

662
00:48:26.632 --> 00:48:29.899
-Just as a birthday present ...
I picked-up names,

663
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.706
Fill Dill, Cill, Guill, Dill,
Hill, Trill ...

664
00:48:32.707 --> 00:48:36.335
Okay.
I've got it.

665
00:48:36.336 --> 00:48:38.685
And will one-up Will.
-Good for you.

666
00:48:38.686 --> 00:48:40.615
We could get
our own school.

667
00:48:40.616 --> 00:48:42.118
We are males.

668
00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:44.322
-We adopts.
-Takes you, I fit.

669
00:48:44.323 --> 00:48:46.024
I have much to do.

670
00:48:46.025 --> 00:48:49.464
Okay, then can go,
go quench your thirst for blood.

671
00:48:49.465 --> 00:48:51.953
The many other
Krills at sea.

672
00:48:53.553 --> 00:48:57.339
Many would appreciate Krills
have me as a partner.

673
00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.999
I'm a hell of a partner.

674
00:49:18.808 --> 00:49:20.683
You're the only school
I have.

675
00:49:20.684 --> 00:49:23.732
You know that,
but no intimacy.

676
00:50:14.039 --> 00:50:16.942
-Are you hurt?
No, I'm fine.

677
00:50:17.344 --> 00:50:20.553
-I'm fine.
-What is Seymour, gimme a break.

678
00:50:20.674 --> 00:50:22.702
No, no,
Thank you, brother.

679
00:50:22.703 --> 00:50:24.906
My kids are out there.

680
00:50:29.413 --> 00:50:31.613
Then, no!

681
00:50:38.704 --> 00:50:41.146
Erik and Atticus, to hide.

682
00:50:41.247 --> 00:50:43.895
Let's hide here.

683
00:50:46.963 --> 00:50:51.025
Rolls, rolls, rolls,
where I can fly!

684
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:55.814
Look,
My favorite

685
00:50:55.816 --> 00:50:58.195
penguins trapped
a wall of ice.

686
00:50:58.196 --> 00:51:00.848
Let's do a rotation.
-Forever.

687
00:51:01.249 --> 00:51:03.727
Never seen so many seagulls
in one place.

688
00:51:03.728 --> 00:51:05.514
Stay together,
do not differ.

689
00:51:05.515 --> 00:51:07.950
I guess you never
leave here.

690
00:51:07.951 --> 00:51:11.312
These savages and cowards
only hunt the weak.

691
00:51:11.313 --> 00:51:13.224
Noah admits,
're dead meat.

692
00:51:13.225 --> 00:51:16.395
No, we are emperor penguins.
-With pride.

693
00:51:16.396 --> 00:51:20.704
We looked into the eyes of the hungry
but not surrender.

694
00:51:21.336 --> 00:51:24.577
Even surrounded
by walls of ice

695
00:51:24.578 --> 00:51:26.708
will not be defeated!

696
00:51:26.709 --> 00:51:28.793
That's how you talk, Noah!

697
00:51:28.794 --> 00:51:33.159
We are courage,
we are brave.

698
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.908
We are the glorious
Empress nation.

699
00:52:17.406 --> 00:52:19.399
Erik, stay low.

700
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.754
-Mano?
-They are good.

701
00:52:22.755 --> 00:52:24.557
Gloria, behind you!

702
00:52:25.259 --> 00:52:27.651
Get someone
its size, coward.

703
00:52:27.652 --> 00:52:31.183
Do not worry, Princess.
I'll get you first.

704
00:52:31.184 --> 00:52:35.115
While chilled
before they become hard and rotten.

705
00:52:37.039 --> 00:52:38.721
Boadicea.

706
00:53:08.982 --> 00:53:10.384
This is my daughter!

707
00:53:10.686 --> 00:53:12.365
What smart!

708
00:53:12.366 --> 00:53:17.093
The union of nations,
This is what solidarity is.

709
00:53:17.113 --> 00:53:18.831
Well, now what?

710
00:53:18.832 --> 00:53:23.380
Now, they managed
a stay of execution.

711
00:53:23.381 --> 00:53:26.105
Who are you?
-A idiot. Thank you.

712
00:53:26.224 --> 00:53:28.235
Bo, you got it.

713
00:53:29.865 --> 00:53:33.378
Hello friends,
you came.

714
00:53:33.379 --> 00:53:35.418
Sure we have come.
Told Us.

715
00:53:35.419 --> 00:53:37.321
-Where is Ramon?
-No longer with us.

716
00:53:37.322 --> 00:53:39.118
Is a better place
next to the ...

717
00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:40.921
Carmen.

718
00:53:43.348 --> 00:53:45.629
Carmen, wait!

719
00:53:47.532 --> 00:53:49.986
I do not want to dip
your feet, my love.

720
00:53:49.987 --> 00:53:51.810
I'm not your love.

721
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:54.917
See, what I said Carmen
it will leave only one stick.

722
00:53:55.218 --> 00:53:57.606
Get out,
I'm just Carmen.

723
00:53:57.807 --> 00:54:00.845
Ramon, it's unbelievable,
everyone came.

724
00:54:00.846 --> 00:54:03.435
Least the guy who stayed behind,
it was cold.

725
00:54:03.436 --> 00:54:04.922
He is not here.

726
00:54:04.923 --> 00:54:06.916
You're a great friend.
Thank you, friend.

727
00:54:06.917 --> 00:54:08.626
Do not look at me,
had nothing to do.

728
00:54:08.627 --> 00:54:11.418
So, it was love,
thank you.

729
00:54:11.819 --> 00:54:13.866
He thanked the penguin wrong.

730
00:54:13.867 --> 00:54:16.195
Hello, how are you?

731
00:54:16.196 --> 00:54:19.316
-I knew.
Small-Erik health.

732
00:54:19.914 --> 00:54:24.585
Well, all friends
present and assembled

733
00:54:24.586 --> 00:54:29.042
we will not rest
until they are all fat.

734
00:54:29.043 --> 00:54:30.535
That's right.

735
00:54:39.244 --> 00:54:44.130
<i>The funniest sound 
I've heard </ i></i>

736
00:54:44.629 --> 00:54:49.274
<i>I could not understand 
a single word </ i></i>

737
00:54:50.316 --> 00:54:53.180
<i> is now spreading
throughout the land </ i></i>

738
00:54:53.185 --> 00:54:56.822
<i>I still can not 
understand </ i></i>

739
00:55:00.984 --> 00:55:05.416
<i> I said and then partner
what is the name </ i></i>

740
00:55:06.778 --> 00:55:11.092
<i> not dare to tell me
the same thing </ i></i>

741
00:55:12.194 --> 00:55:15.098
<i> your own music
I can not understand </ i></i>

742
00:55:15.099 --> 00:55:18.987
<i>But  has a sound that
makes me dance like crazy </ i></i>

743
00:55:21.162 --> 00:55:28.606
I bring a lot of fish,
my courtesy.

744
00:55:28.802 --> 00:55:31.068
Shows how to do it, brother.

745
00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.682
Who is that guy?

746
00:55:37.683 --> 00:55:40.510
Call him the insect,
he's fantastic.

747
00:55:40.511 --> 00:55:43.192
Let me repeat
I told you before ...

748
00:55:43.447 --> 00:55:44.904
Idiot.

749
00:55:45.105 --> 00:55:46.808
-Guess what?
What?

750
00:55:46.809 --> 00:55:50.176
It carries more fish than
penguin that any existed.

751
00:55:50.177 --> 00:55:54.237
In-land.
-And he's amazing ...

752
00:55:54.238 --> 00:55:55.639
Impressive ...

753
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.729
-Sven?
What?

754
00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.317
Is anyone down there
very special.

755
00:56:01.618 --> 00:56:05.675
If I know Gloria, she
will not eat until everyone eat.

756
00:56:05.977 --> 00:56:08.360
Can you take
this for her?

757
00:56:08.361 --> 00:56:10.452
Yes, do not be silly,
where is he?

758
00:56:10.453 --> 00:56:12.132
No, she.

759
00:56:12.133 --> 00:56:14.817
Ali, surrounded by children.
-That is your wife?

760
00:56:14.828 --> 00:56:16.129
-Yes.
Really? -Yes.

761
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.541
-Your wife?
Yes, take the fish.

762
00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:22.436
No, no, no.
She deserves the best.

763
00:56:27.493 --> 00:56:29.295
-Want to hear a song?
Do not.

764
00:56:29.296 --> 00:56:30.798
Let's listen to a song.

765
00:56:30.809 --> 00:56:33.313
<i>I expect 
before leaving. </ i></i>

766
00:56:33.314 --> 00:56:35.800
<i>Why not plan 
stay out. </ i></i>

767
00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:38.458
<i>Wake me 
before leaving. </ i></i>

768
00:56:38.649 --> 00:56:40.251
Will you shut up.

769
00:56:40.252 --> 00:56:42.673
Shut up!

770
00:56:46.466 --> 00:56:48.383
<i> I'll never let you </ i></i>

771
00:56:48.384 --> 00:56:50.866
<i> nor will I disappoint you </ i></i>

772
00:56:50.967 --> 00:56:53.209
A convention of predators?

773
00:56:53.211 --> 00:56:55.166
-There, there!
-Why was not I invited?

774
00:56:55.167 --> 00:56:56.776
-Will.
-Guys, guys?

775
00:56:56.777 --> 00:56:58.580
-Will not go ...
-Get out.

776
00:56:58.581 --> 00:57:00.083
-You will not survive.
Me misses.

777
00:57:00.084 --> 00:57:02.051
Will stop.

778
00:57:03.556 --> 00:57:05.453
I think the best part.

779
00:57:05.454 --> 00:57:08.980
If I'm invading your space,
How about this?

780
00:57:08.981 --> 00:57:12.216
No, no, I'm talking about,
separated from truth.

781
00:57:12.759 --> 00:57:15.067
More ...
Why?

782
00:57:16.874 --> 00:57:19.174
My life is like now.

783
00:57:19.375 --> 00:57:22.487
I can change,
be less invisible.

784
00:57:22.488 --> 00:57:24.831
See, you'll be great.

785
00:57:24.832 --> 00:57:27.102
See you, kid.

786
00:57:30.739 --> 00:57:35.456
Will, please
do not let me.

787
00:57:42.184 --> 00:57:45.805
I'll take you, you,
you, and you.

788
00:57:47.151 --> 00:57:51.242
Please, someone, anyone,
I lost my Will.

789
00:57:51.243 --> 00:57:57.090
I beg you, please
Will my return.

790
00:58:10.236 --> 00:58:12.839
-Mano.
-Sven.

791
00:58:13.842 --> 00:58:17.419
-I will give to his wife, okay.
-Okay, thank you.

792
00:58:18.381 --> 00:58:20.353
Right Sven, here I come.

793
00:58:20.354 --> 00:58:22.996
Form a single queue
and smiled.

794
00:58:23.699 --> 00:58:26.040
You must be glorious.

795
00:58:26.041 --> 00:58:27.789
And you must be Sven.

796
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:32.125
It is a pleasure for me to know,
seriously because I'm thrilled.

797
00:58:33.694 --> 00:58:37.320
I brought you
the best seafood.

798
00:58:37.321 --> 00:58:39.954
It was the Mano-there he is.
Hi.

799
00:58:39.955 --> 00:58:41.958
He asked me.

800
00:58:49.885 --> 00:58:53.323
-It is my language.
I'm sorry.

801
00:58:55.682 --> 00:58:59.049
If direction is not
the feeling satisfied.

802
00:58:59.751 --> 00:59:02.020
Can I get more.

803
00:59:02.742 --> 00:59:07.407
No Sven, I bet you have
others more hungry than me.

804
00:59:07.808 --> 00:59:10.601
I understand.
See you at dinner?

805
00:59:10.703 --> 00:59:13.049
I'm kinda busy.

806
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:15.391
Kinda busy.

807
00:59:18.484 --> 00:59:20.371
Even more!

808
00:59:23.676 --> 00:59:25.779
She is beautiful.

809
00:59:25.879 --> 00:59:28.134
Honey, are you okay?

810
00:59:28.135 --> 00:59:30.961
Are you sure he
no relation to Ramon?

811
00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:33.633
You Ingracia!

812
00:59:34.815 --> 00:59:37.799
Should not scoff at someone,
just because it's different.

813
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.086
Even someone who is having more
a lot of work to save us.

814
00:59:41.087 --> 00:59:44.193
-You are right. When Sven-
teach them all to fly.

815
00:59:44.194 --> 00:59:45.948
It will be a rising up.

816
00:59:45.949 --> 00:59:47.612
-Erik, not ...
-Get out of here.

817
00:59:47.613 --> 00:59:50.630
-You will see.
Who dropped the fish?

818
00:59:50.631 --> 00:59:53.648
Guys, what's happening
with the fish?

819
00:59:55.867 --> 00:59:59.942
Fish friends
what's the problem?

820
01:00:02.892 --> 01:00:04.967
The birds eat.

821
01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:08.334
Sven, you must fly
on the wings of hope

822
01:00:08.335 --> 01:00:10.958
and ask them to help
brothers emperors.

823
01:00:10.959 --> 01:00:12.976
I'd love to know
but ...

824
01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:15.279
No!

825
01:00:15.463 --> 01:00:20.149
I need to stretch their wings,
then, bye.

826
01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.652
Interesting.

827
01:00:21.653 --> 01:00:24.075
Do something
because they will not stop.

828
01:00:24.076 --> 01:00:26.694
Relax, I know exactly
how to get attention

829
01:00:26.695 --> 01:00:29.298
of our benefactors
aliens.

830
01:00:40.505 --> 01:00:44.303
Relax, breathe deeply,
take a deep breath.

831
01:02:00.945 --> 01:02:05.413
-Loving.
-I am the mayor of the village!

832
01:02:05.414 --> 01:02:08.729
In this place, I say!
-This is great.

833
01:02:14.366 --> 01:02:17.129
Can you believe that.

834
01:02:24.306 --> 01:02:27.055
If you have a Will,
has one output.

835
01:03:09.942 --> 01:03:13.493
Bill, are you?

836
01:03:20.716 --> 01:03:22.419
I know not, Uncle Mano ...

837
01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.392
are noisy and are
destroying our ice.

838
01:03:25.393 --> 01:03:28.334
Atticus, are building
a way out of here.

839
01:03:29.612 --> 01:03:32.448
All they thought
never would leave here.

840
01:03:32.449 --> 01:03:36.340
Look, our road
to freedom.

841
01:03:38.453 --> 01:03:40.505
It will not
long, boys.

842
01:03:40.506 --> 01:03:42.209
I will miss you here.

843
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:45.065
Where we live
when everyone leaves?

844
01:03:45.066 --> 01:03:47.902
We'll find a new place
dear, the world is big.

845
01:03:47.903 --> 01:03:50.798
And just being together
which is already a home.

846
01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:52.300
It is.

847
01:04:31.856 --> 01:04:34.959
Let children
to hide.

848
01:04:59.971 --> 01:05:02.537
Carmen, you see ...

849
01:05:02.638 --> 01:05:06.129
even in the mystical
should be a couple.

850
01:05:39.528 --> 01:05:41.329
No, no, no!

851
01:05:57.827 --> 01:06:01.288
-Are you still here.
-And you're still here.

852
01:06:01.389 --> 01:06:03.119
-They were.
What?

853
01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.359
A little while bad
they disappear.

854
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.507
Who's missing?
-Aliens.

855
01:06:07.508 --> 01:06:11.740
What?
-All this for nothing.

856
01:06:31.179 --> 01:06:33.776
They abandoned us.

857
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:39.148
Folks, the sea is frozen.

858
01:06:39.149 --> 01:06:42.561
It is impossible
the aliens return.

859
01:06:42.562 --> 01:06:45.096
Frozen hard.
Frozen hard.

860
01:06:45.097 --> 01:06:48.176
If the sea is so far,
we will take as food.

861
01:06:48.177 --> 01:06:50.304
Than before die
hunger, too.

862
01:06:50.305 --> 01:06:52.708
-I better go.
-We can not let them.

863
01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:56.539
-I think they'll leave.
-It seems that we ...

864
01:06:57.143 --> 01:07:03.416
I must inform you that the Adelie,
not help us anymore.

865
01:07:04.563 --> 01:07:07.064
And who will bring us fish?

866
01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:10.632
Some good questions,
has no good answer.

867
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.688
Sven can not
leave us, not now.

868
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:18.771
I'm sorry, fofuxo.

869
01:07:18.772 --> 01:07:23.193
If they also get
no longer be alive.

870
01:07:23.599 --> 01:07:26.413
I can not stand ...
Do not take it anymore.

871
01:07:26.414 --> 01:07:28.764
Get away from me.
I'll leave.

872
01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:41.569
-That crazy guy!
Me too.

873
01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:44.372
We girls
let's jump.

874
01:07:49.826 --> 01:07:53.331
Sven, teach them,
teaches them to fly.

875
01:07:53.332 --> 01:07:55.419
Erik is not so easy.

876
01:07:56.121 --> 01:07:58.199
Help them Sven
help them.

877
01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.804
But not all
Penguin is equal, Erik.

878
01:08:00.805 --> 01:08:02.297
But you're a penguin.

879
01:08:02.298 --> 01:08:04.928
I am a little more
a penguin.

880
01:08:04.929 --> 01:08:08.350
-I ...
-They almost succeeded.

881
01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:11.578
Courage Sven
take all the sky!

882
01:08:11.609 --> 01:08:14.545
Come on Sven, teaches.
-Teach, brother.

883
01:08:14.746 --> 01:08:17.050
-They are penguins.
You're a penguin.

884
01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:19.659
-I am a bird.
-You what?

885
01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.924
A bird-...
What?

886
01:08:21.925 --> 01:08:25.586
Flying bird,
if I did not try ...

887
01:08:25.587 --> 01:08:30.343
Drive, drive ...
After just a technique, is not it?

888
01:08:30.344 --> 01:08:31.777
Yes, yes.

889
01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:36.084
All raise your head,
back to back.

890
01:08:38.393 --> 01:08:42.490
Feel the wind
with its wings.

891
01:08:45.055 --> 01:08:48.260
Move the fins
and sing.

892
01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:05.205
You're gonna get it,
gravity!

893
01:09:07.589 --> 01:09:10.593
Now go,
I'm going.

894
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.704
-Fly, Daddy!
-Fly!

895
01:09:21.103 --> 01:09:22.929
Come on!
If you want to have want-

896
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.533
if you want will be yours.

897
01:09:30.972 --> 01:09:32.874
What a pity!

898
01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:42.282
Today is a victory ...

899
01:09:43.886 --> 01:09:47.040
-Defeat.
Sven-Powerful.

900
01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:49.444
You did everything
pinguin impossible.

901
01:09:49.445 --> 01:09:51.346
-I am not a penguin.
What?

902
01:09:51.511 --> 01:09:54.488
I am a parrot of the sea.

903
01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:59.827
A puffin
that is no longer the sea.

904
01:09:59.957 --> 01:10:01.799
Do not.
-Bravo, Loving

905
01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:05.228
brought us a strange bird,
and told us it was a penguin.

906
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:06.630
Bravo.

907
01:10:07.232 --> 01:10:09.435
Thanks, I deserved.

908
01:10:14.142 --> 01:10:17.104
Sorry people,
I'm sorry.

909
01:10:17.105 --> 01:10:19.892
But when I lost
my hometown.

910
01:10:19.893 --> 01:10:25.047
I was very lonely
and very scared.

911
01:10:25.449 --> 01:10:29.367
Then I met you,
and you believed in me.

912
01:10:29.368 --> 01:10:30.908
Sven ...

913
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:35.114
It was so good
have a family.

914
01:10:36.684 --> 01:10:38.528
Thank you.

915
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:42.790
And that goes up to heaven.

916
01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:16.745
Folks, let's try this.

917
01:11:24.557 --> 01:11:27.675
Come on, everybody together.

918
01:11:27.676 --> 01:11:31.180
-Everybody dance!
-Come on!

919
01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:34.185
Come on, everybody!

920
01:11:34.611 --> 01:11:36.489
We are screwed
and they dance.

921
01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:38.089
Unbelievable.

922
01:11:44.728 --> 01:11:46.431
That's it.

923
01:12:56.648 --> 01:12:58.050
Atticus.

924
01:12:58.051 --> 01:12:59.957
-Mother.
-Boadicea.

925
01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:01.396
Are you okay?

926
01:13:05.027 --> 01:13:09.135
-Erik.
-Help!

927
01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:24.035
-I missed you, Dad.
Me too.

928
01:13:28.933 --> 01:13:31.856
Hold on, Erik!
I'm going!

929
01:13:37.587 --> 01:13:41.059
Erik bites,
bites hard.

930
01:13:43.603 --> 01:13:45.995
-Secure.
-Quick.

931
01:13:45.996 --> 01:13:49.445
-Running.
-Hold On!

932
01:13:53.753 --> 01:13:55.669
Come on, almost there.

933
01:13:57.087 --> 01:13:59.189
-Dad.
It's okay, Erik.

934
01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:02.942
Okay,
I got you.

935
01:14:03.455 --> 01:14:05.764
They are stronger
than we think.

936
01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:09.675
Let Erik
let's get outta here.

937
01:14:09.676 --> 01:14:11.862
Carmen! Carmen!

938
01:14:12.264 --> 01:14:15.915
Where is Carmen?
Carmen!

939
01:14:16.517 --> 01:14:19.553
Relax, Ramon.
I'm fine.

940
01:14:19.554 --> 01:14:21.141
I think.

941
01:14:21.243 --> 01:14:24.908
I hate relationships
long distance.

942
01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:27.908
Friends, do me a favor.
-Okay.

943
01:14:27.909 --> 01:14:29.389
I count to three.

944
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.627
-And I push the two.
-He will fly.

945
01:14:31.628 --> 01:14:33.231
But do not tell me, right.

946
01:14:33.432 --> 01:14:35.335
A. ..
Two ...

947
01:14:35.636 --> 01:14:39.304
Carmen, I'm going!

948
01:14:40.921 --> 01:14:44.112
Who is Ramon? Ramon, pablo,
garcia santa maria ...

949
01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:51.095
Ramon, do not believe
that did it.

950
01:14:51.096 --> 01:14:52.397
How do?

951
01:14:52.398 --> 01:14:54.265
But we're done here.

952
01:14:54.266 --> 01:14:57.130
The thousands of lives up there,
are nothing compared

953
01:14:57.131 --> 01:14:59.333
this time
at his side.

954
01:15:00.135 --> 01:15:02.601
You are my world.

955
01:15:03.485 --> 01:15:07.476
-You are beautiful.
-Only on the outside.

956
01:15:07.477 --> 01:15:10.981
No, I did not
seen it before.

957
01:15:10.982 --> 01:15:12.844
You are very beautiful.

958
01:15:12.845 --> 01:15:15.279
-Do you really think.
-Absolutely.

959
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:20.094
Ramon, my fallen angel, you
chased me until I win.

960
01:15:28.845 --> 01:15:30.447
Ramon, the land
is moving.

961
01:15:30.448 --> 01:15:33.794
I know, it's amazing.
No, it's the truth, he!

962
01:15:50.793 --> 01:15:54.340
Mano, the iceberg is on the edge,
keep trying.

963
01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:57.639
-Just need a little push.
-We did it.

964
01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.143
Okay.

965
01:16:17.788 --> 01:16:20.147
It is not enough.

966
01:16:20.548 --> 01:16:23.382
-This is very little.
-My feet are aching.

967
01:16:23.384 --> 01:16:25.557
Excuse me, Mano?
What?

968
01:16:25.558 --> 01:16:29.933
There's a guy named Isvinson
and I danced with his sister.

969
01:16:30.735 --> 01:16:33.531
We were two times
national champions.

970
01:16:33.532 --> 01:16:35.893
Category-amateurs, so ...
-Okay.

971
01:16:36.237 --> 01:16:38.239
Can I try?

972
01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.965
Yes, yes, of course.

973
01:16:40.267 --> 01:16:43.930
Attention, attention, people!

974
01:16:43.931 --> 01:16:47.547
-The foot of the Mano is hurt.
I know.

975
01:16:47.548 --> 01:16:51.226
But I have a song
and a dance of my country.

976
01:16:51.227 --> 01:16:55.066
Participate with the best
can, very well.

977
01:16:55.067 --> 01:16:58.628
-Here we go.
-Stop it.

978
01:17:11.941 --> 01:17:15.407
<i>Today we celebrate  ma nu IEI </ i></i>

979
01:17:15.408 --> 01:17:19.078
<i> Nu ma nu ma IEI </ i></i>

980
01:17:19.079 --> 01:17:22.094
<i>Today we celebrate 
there in my place </ i></i>

981
01:17:28.262 --> 01:17:31.573
Come on son, let's go.
-Where are we going?

982
01:17:31.574 --> 01:17:33.985
Find a great help.

983
01:18:03.022 --> 01:18:04.624
Where am I?

984
01:18:04.725 --> 01:18:06.328
Who turned out the lights?

985
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:09.222
Is it the end?

986
01:18:09.864 --> 01:18:11.363
Best to do my will.

987
01:18:11.364 --> 01:18:14.234
Williams Will I leave everything
for my imagination.

988
01:18:14.235 --> 01:18:18.003
Imagination is the second sign
of madness.

989
01:18:18.004 --> 01:18:19.989
If I had listened to the Bill.

990
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:24.541
-Bill, I'm sorry!
-All right, Will.

991
01:18:24.542 --> 01:18:27.535
You were right, I should
have stayed in school.

992
01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.142
No, you're right.

993
01:18:29.143 --> 01:18:31.145
That's great!
I'm talking to myself!

994
01:18:31.146 --> 01:18:33.761
-You are not crazy.
-Now I'm seeing things.

995
01:18:33.762 --> 01:18:35.744
What is happening
in my head?

996
01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:38.376
-Please make it stop.
-Will!

997
01:18:41.569 --> 01:18:44.775
Bill, are you really?

998
01:18:44.776 --> 01:18:46.551
There is only one
like me in the world.

999
01:18:46.552 --> 01:18:48.328
-You taught me that.
-Oh, Bill!

1000
01:18:48.329 --> 01:18:50.036
-What a coincidence.
-Is ...

1001
01:18:50.037 --> 01:18:51.845
One in a Krilhão.

1002
01:18:51.846 --> 01:18:53.687
Freeze them,
I want to sleep.

1003
01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:55.992
Guys, is the Will!

1004
01:18:55.993 --> 01:18:58.796
-He is.
-William's Will!

1005
01:18:58.797 --> 01:19:00.399
Shout louder!

1006
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.062
He came back.
The Will is back!

1007
01:19:05.403 --> 01:19:08.775
-Welcome home, Will.
-How did you find them?

1008
01:19:08.776 --> 01:19:11.411
They found me,
I was cansadão.

1009
01:19:11.412 --> 01:19:15.050
-I was so stupid.
-Will, you're a legend.

1010
01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:18.257
Are gone, my friend.
The carnivorous died.

1011
01:19:18.258 --> 01:19:21.030
No, it's because of you,
we're here.

1012
01:19:21.031 --> 01:19:23.535
-It is. -I told them
how the world works

1013
01:19:23.536 --> 01:19:26.019
that there are predators
we have to adapt.

1014
01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.009
I brought them here
on the big ice.

1015
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:30.196
-Nobody will find us here.
But, Bill ...

1016
01:19:30.197 --> 01:19:33.256
What good is staying at the base of
food chain without purpose.

1017
01:19:33.257 --> 01:19:37.200
We all have a purpose
and its is to change the world.

1018
01:19:37.201 --> 01:19:39.950
But what difference
alone would make a krill?

1019
01:19:39.951 --> 01:19:43.707
Wait and see, Will.
Wait and see.

1020
01:19:56.267 --> 01:19:58.469
-What're looking at me?
-What are you looking at me?

1021
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:02.940
And you're ugly too
you get no response and curses.

1022
01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:06.085
-You'll get out there.
-We are already out.

1023
01:20:06.487 --> 01:20:08.790
-Come up!
No, you come!

1024
01:20:08.791 --> 01:20:12.076
Excuse me,
Brian, here below.

1025
01:20:12.779 --> 01:20:15.205
And there buddy,
what are you doing here?

1026
01:20:15.206 --> 01:20:17.612
Brian, I need a favor,
a big one.

1027
01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.318
For you champion,
anything.

1028
01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:21.114
I need you
the land of the emperors.

1029
01:20:21.215 --> 01:20:23.168
And as you can take
of its kind.

1030
01:20:23.169 --> 01:20:26.554
-Why?
-To dance, you know ...

1031
01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:29.386
And why should we
do this?

1032
01:20:29.387 --> 01:20:31.391
To free the nation-penguin.
-I know.

1033
01:20:31.392 --> 01:20:33.222
-There was a catastrophe.
-Right.

1034
01:20:33.223 --> 01:20:35.296
The entire population
stuck

1035
01:20:35.297 --> 01:20:38.684
-Between blocks of snow and ice.
Come on, Brian!

1036
01:20:38.685 --> 01:20:42.475
I love you boy but
arrived at the worst possible time.

1037
01:20:42.476 --> 01:20:44.528
Who knows after
spend the winter.

1038
01:20:44.529 --> 01:20:48.247
No, it will be too late.
-Brian, you will fight or not?

1039
01:20:48.248 --> 01:20:49.797
You said
I had one.

1040
01:20:49.798 --> 01:20:51.949
But now I have
my own problems.

1041
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:54.143
Everyone is nervous,
each wanting to catch,

1042
01:20:54.144 --> 01:20:56.247
the crowd needs me
to keep the peace.

1043
01:20:56.248 --> 01:20:58.357
If you do not come now,
a crowd will die.

1044
01:20:58.358 --> 01:21:00.676
There you go putting
the blame on me.

1045
01:21:00.677 --> 01:21:03.664
Whatever happened to
penguins was not my fault.

1046
01:21:03.665 --> 01:21:05.869
It was not, but can
help save them.

1047
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:09.333
Listen brother, you take care of their
people who I take care of mine.

1048
01:21:09.334 --> 01:21:12.038
If I thought so
I leave that hole.

1049
01:21:12.039 --> 01:21:14.471
And the next, you gave up,
get off my turf.

1050
01:21:14.472 --> 01:21:16.543
Wayne, now I
hurt for real.

1051
01:21:16.544 --> 01:21:18.894
-I saved your life.
-And I will save yours.

1052
01:21:18.895 --> 01:21:20.988
Take your fur
and cuteness and leaks.

1053
01:21:20.989 --> 01:21:24.192
Or I will turn a carnivore
with a soft spot for penguins.

1054
01:21:24.193 --> 01:21:25.986
-But ...
-The only "but" I want to see

1055
01:21:25.987 --> 01:21:28.960
leaking and you here.

1056
01:21:33.359 --> 01:21:34.987
Come on, son ...

1057
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:38.217
We are losing
precious time.

1058
01:21:38.818 --> 01:21:41.622
There is no gratitude here.

1059
01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:51.102
-Where were we?
Well here.

1060
01:21:51.103 --> 01:21:53.572
-What's looking?
-What are you looking at?

1061
01:21:59.409 --> 01:22:03.482
<i> not father
This is so unfair </ i></i>

1062
01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:14.714
<i> After all he did
you deserve much more </ i></i>

1063
01:22:16.818 --> 01:22:20.597
<i>Nothing makes sense 
in this world </ i></i>

1064
01:22:23.175 --> 01:22:27.068
<i>'s all a big crazy </ i></i>

1065
01:22:33.044 --> 01:22:39.006
<i> And the Kings are all fools </ i></i>

1066
01:22:40.849 --> 01:22:50.990
<i>Where is the honor 
when a solemn promise </ i></i>

1067
01:22:50.992 --> 01:22:55.014
<i> It's just a beautiful lie </ i></i>

1068
01:22:55.017 --> 01:23:06.865
<i>And mock 
the courage of the humble </ i></i>

1069
01:23:08.168 --> 01:23:15.071
<i>Although it is only 
a common penguin </ i></i>

1070
01:23:15.072 --> 01:23:19.919
<i> My father taught me </ i></i>

1071
01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:26.763
<i>You do not need 
be a colossal </ i></i>

1072
01:23:26.764 --> 01:23:32.830
<i>To have a great 
Heart </ i></i>

1073
01:23:33.031 --> 01:23:44.404
<i>You do not need to fly 
to be amazing </ i></i>

1074
01:23:45.206 --> 01:23:54.629
<i> My hero, my father, </ i></i>

1075
01:24:19.129 --> 01:24:23.183
<i> Keep moving,
moving, moving ...</ i></i>

1076
01:24:23.184 --> 01:24:27.944
<i>Keep all 
moving forward </ i></i>

1077
01:24:27.945 --> 01:24:30.423
<i> Rain and wind and weather. </ i></i>

1078
01:24:30.424 --> 01:24:32.687
<i>Hell  curves
to us. </ i></i>

1079
01:24:32.688 --> 01:24:37.611
<i>His desire 
been there for me. </ i></i>

1080
01:24:38.091 --> 01:24:41.648
-I do not believe.
-Neither do I.

1081
01:24:41.871 --> 01:24:44.763
I know that guy,
is Brian.

1082
01:24:52.174 --> 01:24:55.581
The Iceberg got to move,
find an elephant seal

1083
01:24:55.582 --> 01:24:57.067
and start dancing.

1084
01:24:57.068 --> 01:25:00.475
Penguin, like a dance,
move it.

1085
01:25:00.476 --> 01:25:02.613
With enough jaw
We can move the snow.

1086
01:25:02.614 --> 01:25:04.390
Put force it!
That's right.

1087
01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:07.153
Will not roll partner,
is a huge iceberg.

1088
01:25:07.154 --> 01:25:10.699
Try to tap the rhythm
hard and together.

1089
01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:12.847
-Hit me stronger.
Me too.

1090
01:25:12.848 --> 01:25:14.529
But, without moving.
-What, Brian!

1091
01:25:14.530 --> 01:25:18.103
I say that the impact force
pressure equivalent ...

1092
01:25:18.104 --> 01:25:21.464
Go-yellow, its yellowing.
-Wayne!

1093
01:25:40.339 --> 01:25:44.485
-Here we go!
It is well-spoken, Brian.

1094
01:25:51.495 --> 01:25:55.528
Listen to me boys!
That's it!

1095
01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.644
<i>Pressure  me down
with a push </ i></i>

1096
01:25:58.645 --> 01:26:02.852
<i>Dropping you 
no man ask for </ i></i>

1097
01:26:03.054 --> 01:26:04.692
<i> Under Pressure </ i></i>

1098
01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:07.214
<i>What ignites 
an entire building </ i></i>

1099
01:26:07.215 --> 01:26:09.608
<i>Splits a family 
two </ i></i>

1100
01:26:09.609 --> 01:26:12.348
<i> Puts people on the street </ i></i>

1101
01:26:20.394 --> 01:26:22.397
<i> terror is to know </ i></i>

1102
01:26:22.398 --> 01:26:24.769
<i>At what point 
came the world </ i></i>

1103
01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:26.460
<i>Watching some 
good friends </ i></i>

1104
01:26:26.461 --> 01:26:28.898
<i>Screaming :
-Let me out! </ I></i>

1105
01:26:28.899 --> 01:26:42.498
<i> I pray that tomorrow
let me more excited </ i></i>

1106
01:26:43.295 --> 01:26:46.143
Hear that?
They are doing it again.

1107
01:26:46.144 --> 01:26:48.718
-Doing what?
-It.

1108
01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.623
Give time!

1109
01:26:51.718 --> 01:26:54.604
-What is this?
-I have no idea.

1110
01:26:54.605 --> 01:26:56.213
Serves for what?

1111
01:26:56.215 --> 01:26:57.763
Perhaps a
momentary relief

1112
01:26:57.764 --> 01:27:00.038
existential terror
of existence.

1113
01:27:00.039 --> 01:27:03.331
What?
-Makes me happy.

1114
01:27:11.303 --> 01:27:12.905
That's it.

1115
01:27:14.207 --> 01:27:18.528
-Brian, what are you doing?
-Sometimes you have to go back

1116
01:27:18.579 --> 01:27:21.056
to move on.

1117
01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:27.285
<i>Can not we give 
one more chance </ i></i>

1118
01:27:27.286 --> 01:27:31.363
<i> Why can not we give
to love one more chance? </ i></i>

1119
01:27:31.364 --> 01:27:36.411
<i>Why can not we 
give love </ i></i>

1120
01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:42.891
That's it!

1121
01:27:42.892 --> 01:27:45.715
Come on, give love!

1122
01:27:46.642 --> 01:27:49.145
Hey, come here.

1123
01:27:49.546 --> 01:27:51.153
-I.
-Yes.

1124
01:27:51.154 --> 01:27:52.520
Let's dance.

1125
01:27:52.521 --> 01:27:55.145
<i>Love challenges you 
to care for </ i></i>

1126
01:27:55.146 --> 01:28:01.166
<i>People 
on the edge of the night </ i></i>

<i> love challenges you

1128
01:28:06.179 --> 01:28:10.292
<i>In  worry
with ourselves </ i></i>

1129
01:28:10.293 --> 01:28:14.061
<i> This is our last dance </ i></i>

1130
01:28:14.463 --> 01:28:18.556
<i> This is our last dance </ i></i>

1131
01:28:18.557 --> 01:28:27.368
<i>This  ourselves </ i></i>

1132
01:29:14.763 --> 01:29:16.140
Beware, Ramon.

1133
01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:18.153
I'm going, love,
I'm right behind you.

1134
01:29:18.154 --> 01:29:20.556
-Ramon!
-Friend!

1135
01:29:21.258 --> 01:29:23.160
I'm getting emotional
new.

1136
01:29:23.161 --> 01:29:25.866
Come on, Ramon.
-I'm going, love.

1137
01:29:25.867 --> 01:29:28.439
And-there, Erik.
-Good work, Erik.

1138
01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.954
You, too, Uncle Mano.
-You are very special brother.

1139
01:29:30.955 --> 01:29:33.934
Mano a nation,
a nation.

1140
01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:36.879
Singing together now,
Mano, a nation.

1141
01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.356
And that, boys.

1142
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:40.430
-Mother.
-Glory.

1143
01:29:40.431 --> 01:29:42.711
Where's my hug?

1144
01:29:45.218 --> 01:29:46.770
My love!

1145
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:50.005
Let's go home, kids.
Hey, Brian!

1146
01:29:50.006 --> 01:29:54.602
-Health.
From Penguin-good, good!

1147
01:29:58.284 --> 01:29:59.986
E. ..

1148
01:30:00.388 --> 01:30:02.591
Good!
