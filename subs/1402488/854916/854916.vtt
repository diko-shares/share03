Brothers and sisters, penguins all.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:46.430
Everything in this world...

3
00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:48.511
...no matter how big...

4
00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.852
...no matter how small...

5
00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:56.724
...is connected in ways
we never expected.

6
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.194
Yes, indeed.

7
00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:27.380
Penguins of the world unite
Strength in numbers, we can get it right

Let's dance, let's shout

Shake your body down to the ground

18

Let's dance, let's shout

19
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:02.748
Mumble!

20
00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:03.915
Sorry.

21
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.427
<i>Lift your head up
'Cause you're</i> a <i>star</i>

22
00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:08.337
Be strong, boy, know who you are

23
00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.255
Papa said knock them out

24
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:12.720
Yeah, I'm gonna knock them out

25
00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:14.931
Papa said knock them out
Come on

26
00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:17.854
Don't call it a comeback

27
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.310
I've been here for years

28
00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.475
Rockin' my peers, puttin’ suckas in fear

29
00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:24.441
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world
By storm

30
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:26.071
And I'm just getting warm

31
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.822
We're bringing fluffy back, yeah

Them other penguins
Don't know how to act, yeah

33
00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.294
<i>Take 'em to the chorus</i>

34
00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.501
Get your fluffy on
Shake your tail

35
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.712
Get your fluffy on
But watch yourself

36
00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.797
Get your fluffy on

37
00:02:56.968 --> 00:03:00.814
We are a part of the rhythm nation

38
00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:03.775
Ain't nobody

39
00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.561
Loves me better

40
00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:07.150
<i>Makes me happy</i>

41
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:07.904
Makes me

42
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:10.486
Feel that way

43
00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:11.650
Ain't nobody

44
00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.947
Ain't nobody better than you

45
00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:18.870
Nobody's better than you

46
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.502
Do your thing

47
00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.503
Make my body sing

48
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.666
We are a part of the rhythm nation

49
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.129
Do your thing

50
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.418
Do your thing

51
00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.716
Come on, Erik, give it a shot.

52
00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.222
Do your thing

53
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.306
Hey.

54
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.016
Aw, my little munkin.

55
00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:23.646
I'll go talk to him.

56
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.557
Oh, let me try.

57
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.732
Hey, little guy.

58
00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:31.689
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hm.

59
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.825
-You're not joining the party?
-Mm-mm.

60
00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:36.200
Can you say why?

61
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.281
Why?

62
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.287
No. What I mean is, why are you--?

63
00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.039
Uncle Mumble.

64
00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:42.745
I think he's asking, "Why dance?"

65
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:45.411
Like, he needs a solid reason.
Don't you, Erik?

66
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:46.624
Yeah.

67
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.292
Plenty of reasons to dance.

68
00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.124
What's mine, Pa?

69
00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.962
Well, the only way to find out
is to try it.

70
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.129
Come on, son.

71
00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:59.342
It's just one big old foot
after the other.

72
00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:03.179
No one'll laugh at you, I promise.

73
00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:08.225
Come on. On my feet.

74
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.536
I don't care what the people say

75
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:20.782
Yeah.

76
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.832
You'll get the hang of it.
All you gotta do...

77
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:25.913
...is feel the beat.

78
00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:28.374
I'm gonna let it all out, do my thing

79
00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:31.461
We are a part of the rhythm nation

80
00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.376
Come on, son. Let's shake this world!

81
00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:36.011
Show me what you're workin’ with

82
00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.170
Do your thing

83
00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.634
Let's dance, let's shout

84
00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.014
We're bringing fluffy back

85
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.595
Do your thing

86
00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:42.884
Make my body sing

87
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.928
That's it. Get Stupid.

88
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.024
We are a part of the rhythm...

89
00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:03.864
It's not funny!

90
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.285
Can you whiz on cue and finish
with a headstand? I don't think so.

91
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.703
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

92
00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:13.540
Oh, gosh. That was.... Wow.

93
00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:18.254
Oh. Uh....

94
00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.797
Erik. Erik.

95
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:24.976
Erik, I'm really sorry.

96
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.223
Come on, champ. It wasn't that bad.

97
00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.482
When I was your age...

98
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.144
...I got laughed at a lot.
They thought I was weird too.

99
00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:35.608
Mumble!

100
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.564
I mean, different, in a cool way.

101
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.903
Like, you're cool.

102
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.358
I was uncool.

103
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.243
-Easy, easy. Whoa.
-Really uncool.

104
00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.616
Okay. You know, Erik...

105
00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.701
...when your daddy's in a deep hole...

106
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.707
...he's gotta learn to stop digging.

107
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:48.537
Yeah.

108
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.418
Mumble! A little help here.

109
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.045
We'd never have an egg with you.

110
00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:53.204
- No Way.
- No Way.

111
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.089
- Give me one good reason.
- Too short.

112
00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.376
-And you're gross.
-ls that guy bothering you?

113
00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:58.839
No, he's nobody.

114
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.678
I wanna know what love is

115
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.013
-Hey, Mumble.
-Amigo.

116
00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.428
Hey. HEY!

117
00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.562
I want you to show me

118
00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.396
-Ramon, get out of there.
-That's Erik's hole.

119
00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:14.650
-Ramon!
-What?

120
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.945
We're having a private conversation
with Erik.

121
00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.275
So you, too, are mocked
and misunderstood?

122
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.693
Amigo, please.

123
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.611
Don't worry, I can fix it.

124
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:25.449
No,no,no.

125
00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:26.989
Let me tell something to you.

126
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:30.705
What's a best friend for if he cannot
bring a daddy and his boy together?

127
00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.586
Hello? Where are you?

128
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.464
Hello? Hello? Hello?

129
00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:38.129
There you are.

130
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.461
You know, flufﬁto, the truth is...

131
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:44.257
...for wild maverick outcasts
like us who cannot be tamed...

132
00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.346
...this place sucks!

133
00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.011
Ramon, you're being ridiculous.

134
00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.224
Not anymore.

135
00:07:50.387 --> 00:07:52.890
I am going home to Adelie Land.

136
00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.145
Adelie Land, Adelie Land

137
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.278
Be who you want to be
A haven for heroes

138
00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.483
Erik?

139
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.648
Knock knock? Hello?

140
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.739
Honey, I think he needs to be alone
right now.

141
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.744
We can't leave him by himself
in a hole.

142
00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.280
We've got his back, sir.

143
00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.948
Yeah. True that.

144
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:12.659
There you go.

145
00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.874
-Let the hoppers work it out.
-Quite right.

146
00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:15.753
Okay, come on.

147
00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:16.879
All right. Step away.

148
00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.757
Nothing to see here. Shufflely off-ely.

149
00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.510
So much for my daddy skills.

150
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.342
Adiés, Emperor Land!

151
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:28.805
This is one fabulous penguin
you will never laugh at again.

152
00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:30.264
Never!

153
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.175
Hey, Atticus. Snack time.

154
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:04.294
Erik?

155
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.304
Shh. I think they're snuggled up.

156
00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:08.469
All snoozy.

157
00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.725
They're not here.

158
00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:12.894
Bobo!

159
00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.806
Oh! Boadicea!

160
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.645
Come on, Atticus.
Why you fooling around?

161
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:19.900
Where are you?

162
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.437
I know you hear me, Atticus.

163
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.653
Gloria? Do you think they could have,
you know, run off?

164
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.408
Outside? By themselves?

165
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.819
Maybe they followed Ramon.

166
00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.157
, I know.

167
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.789
But I really ought to check it out.
I won't be long.

168
00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:34.870
Mumble, relax.

169
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:38.913
We will find them and when we do,
you'll find a way to put things right.

170
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:40.296
You're a good dad.

171
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.711
Yeah.

172
00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:46.337
I'll be back as soon as I can, okay?

173
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:09.943
Whoa, that was a big one.

174
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.453
I hate it when that happens.

175
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.988
Hey, Will? ls that you?

176
00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:14.997
Of course it's me. Can't you tell?

177
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:16.658
No. Not if we all look the same.

178
00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:17.747
I don't.

179
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:20.879
Will, we are krill.
We are meant to look the same.

180
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.166
Not me, Bill. There's only one of me
in all the world.

181
00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.960
lam one in a krillion. Hm.

182
00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.300
- Where you going?
-I'm leaving.

183
00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.679
I wanna be free, Bill!

184
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:34.309
There's no such thing as free, Will.
Come on, less thinking, more swarming.

185
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.061
I'm sick of swarming.
We've been swarming all our lives.

186
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.188
It's like you've got
a mind of your own.

187
00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.566
Tell me, Bill,
what lies beyond the swarm?

188
00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:42.771
-More swarm.
-And then?

189
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.231
-Some more swarm.
-And then?

190
00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.238
Will, there's nothing but swarm.
We are a swarm without end.

191
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.695
Everything's got an end.
See? I end here.

192
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:51.201
That is not a happy ending.

193
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:52.736
It stands to reason, Bill...

194
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:57.658
...if I swim against the swarm, I must
eventually reach the end of the world.

195
00:10:57.824 --> 00:10:58.825
Yeah.

196
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:05.586
Okay. On the count of three.

197
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.422
One, two, three!

198
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.429
No.

199
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:14.098
I can do this. I can do this.

200
00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:15.258
No, you can't.

201
00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.268
Yes, I can do this. No, you can't.

202
00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:18.644
Who's talking to me? You.

203
00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.430
Who are you? Me. Who said that?

204
00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:28.905
Now walk it out

205
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:30.406
Now walk it out

206
00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:31.782
West side, walk it out

207
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.193
South side, walk it out

208
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.827
East side, walk it out

209
00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:35.828
He)’

210
00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.331
Hey! What's up?
What's this? What's up?

211
00:11:38.489 --> 00:11:39.911
We're coming to Adelie Land.

212
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.953
You aren't. You are without
your parents, this is chicknapping.

213
00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:44.416
Now go. Shoo, shoo!

214
00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.752
-But we can't. We're fugitives.
-Huh?

215
00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:48.542
-Fugi-wha--?
-Fugitives.

216
00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.585
- Fleeing Emperor Land.
-No.

217
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.470
-No happy feets.
-What?

218
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.347
No happy feets.

219
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:57.133
We're rebels
seeking thrills and adventure.

220
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.677
And tasty snacks.

221
00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.140
Oh, thank you.

222
00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:04.024
This guy. All right. I want a big fish,
three little ones...

223
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.776
Oh, oh! Some of those tiny crustaceans.
The little ones that go:

224
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:08.357
Oh, yeah!

225
00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:15.194
-Now go.
-But we can't swim. We're way too fluffy.

226
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.237
- What?
-Fluffy don't float.

227
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.656
But it's too high. I'm a leap-ophobic.

228
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:22.371
Oh, dude! The water's right there.
Like, right there.

229
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.956
I don't care. It's too cold
for a hot blood like me.

230
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:29.545
Atticus, stop!
He's chewing on his flipper!

231
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:31.755
Okay, okay.
Here's what we are going to do.

232
00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:35.673
We count to three. Push me on two.
But you don't tell me, okay?

233
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.636
One, two!

234
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.891
Aah!

235
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.427
What'd you do that for?

236
00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:45.648
Baby penguins. Cute, but ruthless.

237
00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:51.108
Will! Will! What are we
even looking for?

238
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:54.366
That's the beauty of it, my friend.
I don't know.

239
00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.448
Will, please, come back.
I fear the worst.

240
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.078
I fear the worst too, Bill...

241
00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.707
...because fearing the best
is a complete waste of time.

242
00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.410
Oh, yeah. There!

243
00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.544
Maybe it's a black hole.

244
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.426
They're just myths. Scary talk,
to keep us in the swarm.

245
00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:16.554
Coming out of nowhere,
swallowing everything in its path!

246
00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:19.387
For something that doesn't exist,
it's very impressive.

247
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.222
-Swim! Aah!
-Whoa!

248
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.699
Oh, yes.

249
00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.293
It's beautiful.

250
00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:06.596
Uncle Ramon?

251
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:10.233
No. No, no, no. Kids...

252
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.227
...take me home.

253
00:14:16.439 --> 00:14:17.281
So this...

254
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.284
...is all we are. Lunch.

255
00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:24.073
To think we spent our whole lives
not knowing the truth.

256
00:14:24.447 --> 00:14:26.950
Goodbye, Krill World.

257
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.337
Erik.

258
00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.089
Bo.

259
00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.468
Atticus.

260
00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.353
Ramon. Hmm.

261
00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:04.487
Listen.

262
00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.782
Do you hear that?

263
00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:09.492
That's the mating call
of the Adelie female.

264
00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:13.584
I'm about to be thrown to the ground
and crushed by a thousand chicas.

265
00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:18.968
It's okay, ladies!
The love god, he's back!

266
00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:24.177
Whoa! Ignored by thousands.

267
00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:27.010
I said, "The love god is back!"

268
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:34.313
Come on. I got so much love,
I'm going to explode!

269
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.978
- Ramon!
- Amigos!

270
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.523
- I can't believe it!
- I'm back in the band. Yeah!

271
00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:41.487
It's like you never left, but you did.

272
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.028
Ramon, triplets?

273
00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:46.662
No, there's only three.

274
00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.789
Kids, amigos. Amigos, kids.

275
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:49.949
Oh, look at how cute.

276
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.369
Where are the chicas?
The Ramon-starved chicas?

277
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:55.584
-You been away too long.
-There's a lot more competition now, bro.

278
00:15:55.746 --> 00:15:56.713
- To this?
Mm-hm.

279
00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:57.999
Impossible.

280
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.508
Lovelace

281
00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.889
Guru

282
00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.392
We love you

283
00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:08.809
Wow.

284
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:11.187
-Same old Lovelace.
-Only completely different.

285
00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:13.063
He looks like a rainbow.

286
00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.144
Like a rainbow...

287
00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:15.980
- ...with man-chichis.
- Ramon.

288
00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.644
All right!

289
00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:22.190
Brothers and sisters!

290
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.074
Penguins all!

291
00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:27.745
No matter how big!

292
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.615
No matter how small!

293
00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:33.747
We are here today...

294
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:38.673
...for one extraordinary penguin!

295
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.591
Yes, indeed!

296
00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:44.508
It's Sven time!

297
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.263
Sven! Sven!

298
00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.891
Sven! Sven! Sven!

299
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.265
A penguin who's not afraid of heights.
So what?

300
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:11.781
-Whoa!
-Golly gosh!

301
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:14.833
A penguin who can fly.

302
00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.588
up-uppity-up!

303
00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:29.299
Okay, this Mr. Up is going down.

304
00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:34.061
Share the mystery of your history

305
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.972
Tell it, brother! Testify.

306
00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:36.980
Oh, but friends...

307
00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.107
...it's such a long story.

308
00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.439
Then tell the short one!

309
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:41.318
Ramon.

310
00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.647
It begins with the loss of--

311
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:46.236
Hey, Goldilocks. That beak
looks way too big on you!

312
00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:48.117
-It begins--
-The end.

313
00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.903
-Security!
-I can't believe this.

314
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.446
Get your filthy flippers off me!

315
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.330
Let him go. He's fragile right now.

316
00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.116
Yeah! You tell them, amigos!

317
00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:56.830
And they're still talking.

318
00:17:57.034 --> 00:18:00.584
We're still here for you, brother.
Go ahead.

319
00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:02.498
Okey-dokey. Ahem.

320
00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:06.469
It begin with the loss of my--

321
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:10.928
No. No, no, no. I'm sorry.
The moment is gone. I've lost my mojo.

322
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.841
Maybe tomorrow.

323
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:16.513
No, I'm sorry. I'm not feeling it.
Shaw's over.

324
00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:18.727
- Please, sir.
- What?

325
00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.144
Does your story have flying in it?

326
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.946
And where are you from, little squirt?

327
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.527
We're from the Emperor-hood.

328
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.283
And what your name is?

329
00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:30.318
Erik.

330
00:18:30.484 --> 00:18:31.326
Ear-rik.

331
00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:36.036
Hm. In Svenland, we have many
brave warriors called Ear-rik.

332
00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.199
You do?

333
00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:38.868
Oh, ja.

334
00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:40.540
Ja.

335
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.956
Everybody!

336
00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:47.131
Everybody! Your attention, please.

337
00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.887
I dedicate my much-applauded...

338
00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.389
...heartswarming saga...

339
00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.684
...to my brave friend Ear-rik.

340
00:18:54.842 --> 00:18:57.766
Ear-rik

341
00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.098
Ear-rik

342
00:19:01.098 --> 00:19:02.691
Ear-rik

343
00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.395
Ear-rik

344
00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:07.529
Ear-rik

345
00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:08.814
"Ear-rik"?

346
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.574
Ear-rik

347
00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:12.076
Erik.

348
00:19:12.234 --> 00:19:13.326
So...

349
00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:18.951
...it begin with the loss of my home!

350
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:22.086
He was the last of a noble penguin race

351
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.588
Whose world collapsed at a rapid pace

352
00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:27.216
The power to fly was my saving grace

353
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.673
The mighty Sven

354
00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:32.555
From his pretty lips

355
00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:35.341
With his stylish swoops
And his triple flips

356
00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.727
I alone escaped the apocalypse

357
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.855
The mighty Sven

358
00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.391
He journeyed far without a rest

359
00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:45.104
Ooh. Hello there.

360
00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:48.438
Those ﬁghtin’ titans
Were a heck of a test

361
00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:50.944
But even they couldn't take him down

362
00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:54.907
<i>'Cause none could match
The guts and grit of Sven</i>

363
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:56.654
Sven

364
00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:58.743
Guts and grit

365
00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.079
Guts and grit

366
00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:04.121
He met the aliens who ruled the seas

367
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:06.584
They took one look at him
And fell to their knees

368
00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.924
They restored him

369
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.460
They adorned him

370
00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:17.764
And they adored him

371
00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:19.935
Then destiny showed its--

372
00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:23.147
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

373
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.149
Oh, it's okey-dokey.
Don't keep it inside.

374
00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:28.652
Yeah, it's okey-dokey.

375
00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:30.779
Sing it out

376
00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:35.694
Then destiny showed its kindest face

377
00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:41.249
When I was lost in the darkest place

378
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.585
Before I drew my ﬁnal breath

379
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.167
He delivered me

380
00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:52.335
From the thick black death

381
00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:55.346
Bathed and fluffed
All pleasures bestowed

382
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.806
I didn't want to end it

383
00:20:57.965 --> 00:21:01.265
They covered me in a protective robe

384
00:21:01.844 --> 00:21:05.348
There I stood before him

385
00:21:06.015 --> 00:21:08.939
Resplendent

386
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:12.196
Sven! Sven! Sven!

387
00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.486
Erik!

388
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.294
As I was learning the alien speak

389
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.796
What smells so gosh darn good-y?

390
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.806
Sven had a higher truth to seek

391
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:44.395
Who knows what he saw

392
00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:48.057
In that mystic light?

393
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.077
Svensei!

394
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.913
- I've seen our future.
-What?

395
00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:08.043
-Ja, it's calling to me.
-Yeah?

396
00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:11.251
It says "Sven. Sven, go that way!
Quickly!"

397
00:22:11.413 --> 00:22:12.756
I'm with you!

398
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:14.838
The mighty Sven

399
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.252
Oh, my sweet eyes.

400
00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:18.170
He flies

401
00:22:18.337 --> 00:22:22.092
The mighty Sven

402
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.850
And so he came to this far, far shore

403
00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.773
To shine his gifts upon us all

404
00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:32.025
What--?

405
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.113
- What is it?
-it's incredible.

406
00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:38.115
- Really? You've never seen this?
- No.

407
00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:40.409
- This is green.
- Green.

408
00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:42.787
Brothers and sisters,
behold the power...

409
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:43.787
...of Sven.

410
00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:46.369
Let it out, let it out

411
00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:48.955
Let it out
Let it out

412
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:51.621
On that day, I took a vow:

413
00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:56.964
I, Sven, promises to use my powers
Only for good-y

414
00:22:57.126 --> 00:22:58.594
Good-y, good-y

415
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.754
And I dedicate full-time...

416
00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:05.267
...to the "createment"
of a new Adelie Land!

417
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:29.667
ls there no end to the power of Sven?

418
00:23:31.744 --> 00:23:32.996
Sven! Sven!

419
00:23:33.162 --> 00:23:35.164
Sven! Marry me! Marry me!

420
00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:36.669
No, marry me!

421
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:38.167
Marry me! Marry me!

422
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.626
No, no, marry me!

423
00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:41.841
- No, marry me!
- Marry me!

424
00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:43.968
Ah, my beauties.

425
00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:48.602
But if I love the few,
who will love the many?

426
00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:51.139
But if they love you,
who will love Ramon?

427
00:23:51.347 --> 00:23:52.519
Ramon!

428
00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:54.975
Somebody? Anybody?

429
00:23:55.351 --> 00:23:56.694
Nobody?

430
00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:58.354
Body?

431
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.818
Aw, bitter, twisted, lonely guy.

432
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:03.359
You must learn to think like Sven.

433
00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:04.276
Why?

434
00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:05.319
If you want it...

435
00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:06.533
...you must will it!

436
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:07.696
If you will it...

437
00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:09.285
...it will be yours!

Try it. SvenTH I N K.

441
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.291
Sven THINK, Sven THINK.

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.381
-Sven THINK, Sven THINK.
-All right!

443
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:22.135
Excuse me.

444
00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:22.965
Coming through.

445
00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.801
I'll prove it doesn't work.

446
00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:27.058
- Okey-dokey. Now, loosen up.
Mm-hm.

447
00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:28.559
-Empty your mind.
-Done.

448
00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:30.469
And picture your goal.

449
00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:31.728
Okay.

450
00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:33.476
See her eyes. Blue.

451
00:24:33.639 --> 00:24:34.891
No, brown. Deep brown.

452
00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.058
-Short.
-Tal|.

453
00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:37.226
- Slender.
-Bouncy.

454
00:24:37.393 --> 00:24:39.066
- Whatever. Just will it.
- Okay.

455
00:24:39.228 --> 00:24:41.401
Will it harder. Come on, will it harder!

456
00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:43.315
Now with extra added bonus will!

457
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:44.654
Ow! My foot!

458
00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:46.319
Will it, will it, will it!

459
00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:49.405
-Open your eyes.
-Ramon!

460
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.164
- Close your eyes.
-Where are the kids?

461
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:51.915
Security!

462
00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:02.547
You. Me. Beautiful egg.

463
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.087
Now.

464
00:25:04.253 --> 00:25:07.177
You. Me? Fat chance.

465
00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:08.424
I have a chance.

466
00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:09.675
And it's fat!

467
00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:11.936
Carmen, I'm getting serious
stalker vibe.

468
00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:12.720
Carmen.

469
00:25:12.886 --> 00:25:15.264
Her name is Carmen. Oh, Sven.

470
00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:18.726
You're going to be my best friend
and my best man all rolled into one.

471
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:19.609
Hey, Mumble.

472
00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:21.816
Carmen, wait! Where you going?

473
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:22.571
Erik!

474
00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:25.240
- Erik!
- Carmen!

475
00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:26.992
Mumble, Ear-rik is your boy?

476
00:25:27.276 --> 00:25:28.698
Yes, he is. Kids...

477
00:25:28.861 --> 00:25:31.580
-...we're leaving.
-Uncle Mumble, no fair!

478
00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:35.960
-Come on, all of you.
-Oh, no. But this place is so much fun.

479
00:25:36.118 --> 00:25:37.665
Erik. Let's go.

480
00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:40.297
- I'm not going back to Emperor Land.
-Don't be silly.

481
00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:41.457
I'm staying here.

482
00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:44.968
What about the folks back home
and how worried your mother must be?

483
00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:48.597
Ear-rik, it's best to do
what your father's saying.

484
00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:50.474
But I don't belong there.

485
00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:55.308
Oh, fluffy one, I want to tell to you
a secret. Okay?

486
00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:59.016
Sometimes, when you are
a little different...

487
00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:00.810
...the world laugh at you,ja?

488
00:26:01.018 --> 00:26:01.644
Yeah.

489
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:02.982
Think you're funny.

490
00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:04.647
-Pointing flippers.
-Mm-hm.

491
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:07.817
Ja, well, we have a saying
back in Svenland.

492
00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:14.285
Believe in yourself, Ear-rik...

493
00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:16.701
...because Sven believe in you.

494
00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:19.912
_Mighty Sven?

495
00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:22.298
Will I ever fly?

496
00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:26.086
-Erik, please.
-Mumble, the boy seeks a higher truth.

497
00:26:26.502 --> 00:26:28.675
If you want it, you must will it.

498
00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:29.963
If you will it...

499
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.178
...it will be yours.

500
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.637
Now, go.

501
00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:50.526
Ciao.

502
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.159
Ciao.

503
00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:04.419
Uh, son?

504
00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:05.924
Erik...

505
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:08.552
...you know, when things go wrong...

506
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:11.884
...running away is not the answer. Okay?

507
00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:15.893
You have to find within yourself
a way to handle it. Okay?

508
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:16.722
Yeah.

509
00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:18.887
Yeah. And we're all different.

510
00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:21.807
It's part of the job of life
to find out who you are...

511
00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.191
...and what you got.

512
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.227
It may not be dancing or flying...

513
00:27:25.394 --> 00:27:26.862
...but when you find it...

514
00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:29.148
...it'll be all yours.

515
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:31.157
You know what I'm saying?

516
00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:32.029
Yeah.

517
00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:33.660
Okey-dokey.

518
00:27:35.237 --> 00:27:36.830
Right.

519
00:27:37.197 --> 00:27:38.369
Sven

520
00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:50.427
Will! Will! Will! What is this?!

521
00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:52.254
It's the wave of change!

522
00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:56.016
The world is changing, Bill.
We've got to get on the ride!

523
00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:11.448
By the mother of Guin. This cannot be.

524
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.809
Whoa. Something somewhere
just took a big bump.

525
00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:43.938
Yeah.

526
00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:47.147
Sounded awfully close
to Emperor Land.

527
00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:50.153
Come on, guys. Let's pick up the pace.

528
00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:54.070
-This is our moment, Bill.
-Okay.

529
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.156
Adapt or die, my friend.

530
00:28:56.318 --> 00:28:59.162
Adapt? There's no telling
what we might become.

531
00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:01.289
Fine. Be a plankton muncher
all your life.

532
00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:04.327
But that's what we are.
We're herbivores. We eat veggies.

533
00:29:04.493 --> 00:29:06.837
Right. So everyone else can eat us.

534
00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:09.669
Well, I am not prepared
to be on the menu any longer.

535
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.084
- Where you going?
-I'm moving up the food chain.

536
00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:13.218
The food chain?

537
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:15.471
I'm gonna go chew
on something that has a face!

538
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:24.179
- I don't remember this.
- Yeah.

539
00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:26.940
Well, things always
look different on the way back.

540
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:29.067
Guess we'll have to go
all the way around.

541
00:29:29.226 --> 00:29:31.194
-But Emperor Land is straight ahead.
-Yeah.

542
00:29:31.353 --> 00:29:32.775
So why not go over that?

543
00:29:32.938 --> 00:29:34.281
No, no. This way is better.

544
00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:35.941
But shortcuts are shorter.

545
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:38.611
Not always. Now, come on.
It's not that far.

546
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:41.830
Guys, stop!

547
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:45.959
Erik. I said stop!

548
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.626
All right.

549
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.131
All right.

550
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:56.387
We'll keep going,
but take it nice and slow.

551
00:30:01.383 --> 00:30:04.728
And what's say we don't look down,
okay?

552
00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.556
Atticus, what did I just say?

553
00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:09.558
-Whoa!
-Wow.

554
00:30:09.725 --> 00:30:10.692
C-I-'day, sport.

555
00:30:10.851 --> 00:30:11.693
Hi.

556
00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:13.399
-Where you heading?
-Home.

557
00:30:13.562 --> 00:30:16.111
Oh, yeah? So am I.

558
00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:20.201
If you don't mind backing up
a little bit...

559
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.612
...we'll just squeeze past.

560
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:25.032
Back up.

561
00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:27.041
The Beachmaster backs up for nobody.

562
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.826
Then maybe...

563
00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:29.165
...you can move sideways.

564
00:30:29.328 --> 00:30:30.375
Don't do sideways.

565
00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:32.005
We've come all the way across.

566
00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:33.791
You'll have to go all the way back.

567
00:30:33.957 --> 00:30:35.925
I've got the kids. It's kind of dangerous.

568
00:30:36.084 --> 00:30:36.926
Of course.

569
00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:39.508
-And we're anxious to get home.
-I see. Fair enough.

570
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:41.764
But see it my way, sport.

571
00:30:41.923 --> 00:30:44.051
One day, I'll be protecting my beach...

572
00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:46.766
...and some pumped-up mongrel
wants to take it from me.

573
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.939
We're nose-to-nose.
The whole world's watching.

574
00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:52.772
And in the back of me mind,
there's this niggling doubt:

575
00:30:52.934 --> 00:30:54.436
I once backed up for a penguin.

576
00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:56.188
He'll see it in me eyes...

577
00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:58.574
...and I'm gone. Goodbye, ladies.

578
00:30:58.732 --> 00:31:00.700
Hello, lonely beach.

579
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.031
-You with me?
-Yeah, but--

580
00:31:02.194 --> 00:31:03.912
Then get out of my way.

581
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:08.451
My mother says,
"Every obstacle is an opportunity."

582
00:31:08.617 --> 00:31:10.460
- What?
- B0. B0!

583
00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:12.579
Whoa! Unh!

584
00:31:12.746 --> 00:31:14.874
- Hey!
- Yo, dog! You be apologizing...

585
00:31:15.374 --> 00:31:18.093
...or I'm gonna tear you a new nostril.

586
00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:21.554
He didn't mean that.

587
00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.090
That's okay.

588
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:25.054
I didn't mean that.

589
00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:27.974
- SvenTHlNK, SvenTHlNK.
- Erik, no!

590
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.721
Golly gosh!

591
00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:30.639
You fat...

592
00:31:30.806 --> 00:31:31.978
...mother of all bullies!

593
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.392
Get out of my way!

594
00:31:34.643 --> 00:31:36.987
Oh, no.

595
00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:38.655
Erik.

596
00:31:38.939 --> 00:31:39.861
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

597
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:43.114
-Where are you, Daddy?
-Where's he gone?

598
00:31:44.528 --> 00:31:45.324
Uh-oh.

599
00:31:45.487 --> 00:31:46.784
That's not healthy.

600
00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:48.290
Are you okay?

601
00:31:48.448 --> 00:31:49.995
Not exactly.

602
00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.495
Daddy, what are you doing...

603
00:31:53.662 --> 00:31:55.335
-...down there?
-Get back up here.

604
00:31:55.497 --> 00:31:57.124
Not sure I can.

605
00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:58.416
There is a way...

606
00:31:58.583 --> 00:31:59.926
...but you won't like it.

607
00:32:01.378 --> 00:32:03.176
You want me to back up, don't you?

608
00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.176
Come on, Dad.

609
00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:05.306
You can do it.

610
00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:07.968
We won't think less of you, Daddy.

611
00:32:08.135 --> 00:32:13.107
Well, I suppose technically
it's just reversing.

612
00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:16.189
I guess I could, you know,
just a smidge.

613
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:18.270
That's it, Dad.

614
00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:19.689
- That's the spirit.
- Yeah.

615
00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:21.448
- Back.
- That's it.

616
00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:24.359
In no way does this feel natural.

617
00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:27.496
- Now see if you can turn yourself around.
- All right.

618
00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:29.201
Use your flippers.

619
00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:31.662
Whoa! Stop!

620
00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:32.496
Dad!

621
00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:34.870
- Come on, Daddy.
- You can do it.

622
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:36.162
Oh, jeez!

623
00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:38.172
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

624
00:32:43.962 --> 00:32:44.838
Daddy!

625
00:32:45.005 --> 00:32:45.847
Can you hear me...

626
00:32:46.006 --> 00:32:47.553
"Daddy?!

627
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:52.221
Shane? Darren?

628
00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:53.479
Daddy!

629
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.897
I need youse...

630
00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:56.228
...to stay strong.

631
00:32:56.433 --> 00:32:59.653
I know you will,
because you've never let me down.

632
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:02.030
Penguin, you still there?

633
00:33:02.564 --> 00:33:04.066
Yeah. Right here.

634
00:33:04.232 --> 00:33:08.032
Would you see that me boys
get home safe to their mother?

635
00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:10.034
Daddy. What are you saying?

636
00:33:10.572 --> 00:33:12.666
Sorry, boys.

637
00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:15.707
They're calling full time
on your old man's career.

638
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:17.371
-No, Dad! No!
-No, Dad!

639
00:33:19.247 --> 00:33:20.590
Come on. Take a look around.

640
00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:23.092
Can you see any way out?

641
00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:25.216
Yeah. I could grow...

642
00:33:25.378 --> 00:33:26.425
...a pair of wings.

643
00:33:26.588 --> 00:33:27.885
Can you move at all?

644
00:33:28.048 --> 00:33:29.925
I'm stuck, mate.

645
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.182
Okay. Everyone...

646
00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:34.767
...back from the edge.

647
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.398
Come on, get back from the edge.

648
00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:38.934
All right. Now don't move
till I get back.

649
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.101
Where are you going?

650
00:33:40.477 --> 00:33:42.855
To see what I can do for their daddy.

651
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.607
What can he do?

652
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:47.777
He's just an ordinary penguin.

653
00:34:06.002 --> 00:34:09.006
That's one small step for a krill...

654
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:11.800
...one giant leap
for spineless invertebrates.

655
00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:14.061
Holy mother of krill.

656
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:17.314
How's your appetite, Bill?
He's a big ‘un.

657
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.027
What on earth are you doing?

658
00:34:30.193 --> 00:34:31.740
- I'm stalking.
-You can't--!

659
00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.530
-Shh! Shh.
-You can't--

660
00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:35.620
You can't stalk. You're a krill.

661
00:34:35.782 --> 00:34:37.250
We've got to evolve, Bill.

662
00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:41.585
Evolve? Just like that? It's taken us
millions of years just to get this far.

663
00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:45.796
Watch and learn, Billy-boy.
I'm about to naturally select.

664
00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:47.176
No! No, no, no--

665
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:52.181
Hmm.

666
00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:54.634
A little chewy.

667
00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.018
Keenly aromatic.

668
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:58.851
You just nibbled on its butt.
Don't let it go to your head.

669
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:01.187
Au contraire, I will go to its head.

670
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:02.191
Oh, goodness.

671
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:06.105
Onward and upward, my friend.
Fresh delicacies await.

672
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:32.097
Uh, penguin? ls that you?

673
00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:39.516
Streuth.

674
00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:54.202
Oh, penguin.

675
00:35:57.238 --> 00:36:00.583
We're going where no krill
has ever gone before!

676
00:36:00.742 --> 00:36:03.245
Uh-huh.
- We're the stuff of legends, Bill!

677
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:04.754
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay.

678
00:36:04.913 --> 00:36:05.960
How far to the face?

679
00:36:06.122 --> 00:36:07.749
Just ahead!

680
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:09.216
Hey, you!

681
00:36:09.376 --> 00:36:10.753
Doofus!

682
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.552
Yeah, you. Kelp-sucker.

683
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.602
My mistake.

684
00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:31.524
I thought you were
a ruthless killing machine.

685
00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:35.197
Don't you want a little taste of penguin?

686
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.454
Stand back, Bill. This could get messy.

687
00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:00.434
Ha, ha!

688
00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:02.891
He's a fighter! But he'll drop soon.

689
00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:05.273
It's just the death throes!

690
00:37:12.647 --> 00:37:13.739
Yoo-hoo!

691
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:18.244
Whoa!

692
00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:21.155
Whoa!

693
00:37:22.949 --> 00:37:24.496
C-I-'day, gorgeous.

694
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:25.831
I'm sorry.

695
00:37:25.994 --> 00:37:27.246
My mistake.

696
00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:37.009
Dad?

697
00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.218
Boys.

698
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.103
Pa. It worked.

699
00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:47.061
SvenTHlNK.

700
00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:55.695
Oh, yeah! Did you see the look
in his eyes? Mortal terror!

701
00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:57.074
You said he was finished.

702
00:37:57.233 --> 00:37:59.361
-I spared his despicable life!
-What?

703
00:37:59.527 --> 00:38:01.404
He'll tell his friends. Spread the fear.

704
00:38:01.571 --> 00:38:04.199
There's a new predator in town! Sching!

705
00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:05.366
You're insane.

706
00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:08.878
Someone's gotta keep their numbers down,
Bill, and we are that someone.

707
00:38:09.037 --> 00:38:09.913
Oh, boy.

708
00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:12.423
We are the champions, my friend

709
00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:14.880
And we'll keep on ﬁghting till the end

710
00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:15.919
Listen to yourself.

711
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:18.508
Me are the champion
Me are the champion

712
00:38:18.671 --> 00:38:21.345
Delusional singing!
Will, it's the first sign of madness.

713
00:38:21.508 --> 00:38:23.055
Me are the champion

714
00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.978
-How's that shoulder?
-Yeah, it's okay.

715
00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:28.060
Yeah, get some ice on it.
You'll be right.

716
00:38:28.223 --> 00:38:29.691
-Thanks.
-No.

717
00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:30.725
Thank you.

718
00:38:30.892 --> 00:38:34.738
Thanks to you, chief, Beachmaster Bryan
gets to play another season.

719
00:38:34.896 --> 00:38:37.365
I reckon that makes you
an honorary elephant seal.

720
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:38.696
What do you reckon, boys?

721
00:38:38.858 --> 00:38:42.032
Thank you, Your Honor,
for giving us our daddy back.

722
00:38:42.195 --> 00:38:44.744
-Yeah. Cheers, Bryan.
-I owe you one, my friend.

723
00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:45.998
No.

724
00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:48.535
I mean it. All you have to do is ask.

725
00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:51.621
Any time, any place.

726
00:38:51.788 --> 00:38:53.711
No worries. Okay?

727
00:38:53.873 --> 00:38:55.341
No worries.

728
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.922
Okay.

729
00:38:57.335 --> 00:39:00.589
Come on, nippers. Let's get youse home.

730
00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:02.925
- All right.
- Both of youse.

731
00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:04.809
- On you hop, Shane-o.
- Come on, guys.

732
00:39:04.968 --> 00:39:07.266
Go on, Daggy, up you get.

733
00:39:19.023 --> 00:39:20.195
We lost, ain't we?

734
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:22.156
Atticus, we're not lost.

735
00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:24.537
-Emperor Land should be right here.
-Yeah.

736
00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:26.414
My instincts are never wrong.

737
00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:31.830
You all are crazy. I know for a fact
the Emperor-hood is one day that way.

738
00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:33.872
No, that way.

739
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.461
Oh, my goodness!

740
00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:41.045
Oh, no.

741
00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:52.766
Hey, look! Somebody got out!

742
00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:55.060
Aye, you see! I knew there was a way!

743
00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:56.978
Hey, buddy, how do we get out?!

744
00:39:57.145 --> 00:39:58.146
I don't know!

745
00:39:58.313 --> 00:39:59.656
I'm trying to get in!

746
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:00.440
Mumble!

747
00:40:00.607 --> 00:40:01.449
Mumble!

748
00:40:01.608 --> 00:40:02.450
Yo! Dad!

749
00:40:02.609 --> 00:40:05.738
Atticus, my man!
Good to see y'all still kicking!

750
00:40:05.904 --> 00:40:07.121
What happened?

751
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.251
That big old iceberg you on came
thumping and bumping, and here we are!

752
00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:12.501
That's messed up!

753
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.287
Nothing we can't fix, dear!

754
00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:15.296
Mommy!

755
00:40:15.455 --> 00:40:17.253
I told them all to chillax!

756
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:18.837
I knew you'd be fine!

757
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.001
Where's Mommy?

758
00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:21.795
Has anyone seen Gloria?

759
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:26.015
Mumble! Erik!

760
00:40:26.174 --> 00:40:27.175
- Mom!
- Gloria!

761
00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:28.677
My beautiful boys.

762
00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:30.345
Thought I'd never see you again.

763
00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:31.979
Gotta be a way to get you out.

764
00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:34.561
Honey, there are search parties
everywhere.

765
00:40:34.724 --> 00:40:37.102
If there's a way out,
we're gonna find it.

766
00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.269
Don't worry, Daddy!

767
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:41.940
Today Uncle Mumble
got a big old elephant seal out of...

768
00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:43.403
...a big black hole!

769
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:46.490
Yeah. But that was a whole lot different!

770
00:40:46.653 --> 00:40:47.700
But you did.

771
00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:50.615
Mumble! Can you get us
a couple of fish for my kids?

772
00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:53.035
- Mine too!
- Over here!

773
00:40:53.201 --> 00:40:55.124
Okay. I'll do what I can.

774
00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:58.005
- What about my family?
- Hey, don't forget us!

775
00:41:03.503 --> 00:41:05.801
HeY, hey! Hey, listen.

776
00:41:05.964 --> 00:41:08.308
There is a way to feed
a whole lot of you.

777
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:12.312
I'm going to Adelie Land.
Bring back some friends.

778
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.847
You'll have to be patient...

779
00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:15.640
."okay?

780
00:41:15.807 --> 00:41:17.229
Bo, where are you going?

781
00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:19.144
I'm taking the shortcut.

782
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.984
- No, you're not. You're staying here.
- But I'm very fast.

783
00:41:22.522 --> 00:41:24.695
-Erik?
-Be cool. She's a freerunner.

784
00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:29.204
Sorry, Erik. One's faster than two.

785
00:41:29.362 --> 00:41:31.364
Boadicea, do you have a tail feather?

786
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:32.828
Yes, I have a tail feather.

787
00:41:32.991 --> 00:41:34.038
Then you...

788
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.247
...shake it, my dear!

789
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.037
- Booya!
- But, Miss Viola...

790
00:41:37.203 --> 00:41:39.501
...there are all kinds
of dangers out there.

791
00:41:39.664 --> 00:41:41.541
Not dangers, challenges!

792
00:41:41.708 --> 00:41:43.176
Now that's the spirit!

793
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.714
Okay. Okay. Find Uncle Ramon.

794
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.601
Tell him to bring the amigos
and as many Adelies as he can. And--

795
00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:54.057
And always remember the family motto:

796
00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.598
Just let rip!

797
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.950
Come on, Uncle Mumble.
We got some fishing to do.

798
00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:41.476
So, what news have you?

799
00:42:41.642 --> 00:42:45.818
Every nook and cranny, every which way,
completely blocked.

800
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.823
There's a lot of talk out there.

801
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:50.076
-Thinking the unthinkable.
-Yeah.

802
00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.362
Noah, they're calling this
the 'Berg of Doom.

803
00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:53.700
How will we answer that?

804
00:42:53.863 --> 00:42:55.615
-We look again.
-We can't just keep--

805
00:42:55.782 --> 00:42:57.750
We go back and we search
a hundred times.

806
00:42:57.909 --> 00:42:59.001
There is no way out!

807
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.788
A thousand times if we have to.
There's always a way!

808
00:43:02.538 --> 00:43:04.882
Yeah, that's it, right there.

809
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.088
The ice

810
00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:09.716
The ice sounds nice
Check one

811
00:43:10.296 --> 00:43:12.719
The ice
Ice sounds nice

812
00:43:13.549 --> 00:43:15.847
Here. Let me help you.

813
00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:20.273
Okay. Now let it go.

814
00:43:20.932 --> 00:43:21.979
Wait-- Erik!

815
00:43:22.141 --> 00:43:23.518
No! Slow down!

816
00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:26.695
Jump! Jump off!

817
00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:29.987
- Erik!
- Whoa!

818
00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:37.206
Did you see me? Did you?

819
00:43:37.365 --> 00:43:39.333
Don't ever do that again!

820
00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:41.540
Daddy, I was flying!

821
00:43:41.702 --> 00:43:43.454
-Aw, Erik.
-Really flying!

822
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:47.046
I flapped my wings super fast
and I went uppity-up!

823
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:48.551
Son, we're penguins.

824
00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:49.426
We can't fly.

825
00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:51.553
But Sven is a penguin.

826
00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:55.558
I don't know what kind of penguin Sven is,
but we are Emperor penguins. We can't--

827
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:58.219
But if everyone could learn to fly,
Mommy can...

828
00:43:58.386 --> 00:43:59.683
...get out of there!

829
00:43:59.846 --> 00:44:02.474
-Hey.
-I don't know if there's a way out!

830
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.641
Know...way out!

831
00:44:03.808 --> 00:44:04.559
Hey!

832
00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:06.853
But if there is, it sure as eggs
ain't flying.

833
00:44:07.562 --> 00:44:09.109
If you want it, you must will it!

834
00:44:09.272 --> 00:44:11.821
And if you will it, it will be yours!

835
00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:14.236
Aw, Erik, get real. They're trapped.

836
00:44:16.612 --> 00:44:18.080
They're hungry, afraid.

837
00:44:19.073 --> 00:44:20.199
The last thing anyone...

838
00:44:20.366 --> 00:44:22.494
...needs is false hope!

839
00:44:23.244 --> 00:44:24.245
BOys?

840
00:44:25.288 --> 00:44:26.790
Then they'll die.

841
00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.166
Boys...

842
00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:30.130
...what's going on with you two?

843
00:44:31.711 --> 00:44:32.963
Just working things out.

844
00:44:33.129 --> 00:44:34.130
Erik?

845
00:44:34.297 --> 00:44:36.220
We need some mother love, Ms. G.

846
00:44:36.716 --> 00:44:38.468
He's about to explode!

847
00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:40.102
Mumble, why don't you go...

848
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:41.558
...catch some fish?

849
00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:43.605
He ain't hungry...

850
00:44:43.764 --> 00:44:45.107
...Ms. G.

851
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:46.275
It's okay, Atticus.

852
00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:47.310
I got it.

853
00:44:47.476 --> 00:44:48.978
| got it!

854
00:44:49.478 --> 00:44:51.856
Okay, fishing.

855
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:54.776
Erik, just let it go.

856
00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:57.240
Erik, calm down!

857
00:44:57.403 --> 00:45:00.623
Sweetie, take a step back.

858
00:45:02.783 --> 00:45:03.955
Close your eyes.

859
00:45:05.286 --> 00:45:06.788
Deep breath.

860
00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:09.457
Come on, it's easy.

861
00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:14.470
Just when you think

862
00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:17.924
Hope is lost

863
00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:21.435
And giving UP

864
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.768
ls all you got

865
00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:28.776
Blue turns black

866
00:45:29.852 --> 00:45:32.150
Your conﬁdence is cracked

867
00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:36.868
There seems no turnin’ back from here

868
00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:42.366
When your feet

869
00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:45.876
Are made of stone

870
00:45:46.994 --> 00:45:49.998
And you're convinced

871
00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:52.508
That you're all alone

872
00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:56.341
Look at the stars

873
00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:59.515
Instead of the dark

874
00:46:00.883 --> 00:46:02.806
You'll ﬁnd your heart

875
00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:06.519
Shines like the sun

876
00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:12.733
Let's not let our anger get us lost

877
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.198
And the need to be right

878
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:20.237
Comes with way too high a cost

879
00:46:21.821 --> 00:46:24.040
That's when you can build

880
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:25.700
A bridge of light

881
00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:29.086
That's what turns the wrongs all right

882
00:46:29.245 --> 00:46:30.918
That's when you know

883
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.627
It's worth the ﬁght

884
00:46:35.835 --> 00:46:38.714
That's when love
Turns nighttime

885
00:46:38.879 --> 00:46:39.721
Into day

886
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.929
That's when loneliness goes away

887
00:46:43.718 --> 00:46:48.144
That's why you gotta be strong
This night

888
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.893
<i>'Cause only love can build us</i>

889
00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:52.901
A bridge

890
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.904
or light

891
00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:03.655
Deep breath, take it

892
00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:05.539
On the chin

893
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:09.369
But don't forget

894
00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:13.248
To let love back in

895
00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:16.213
That's when love can build

896
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:17.968
A bridge of light

897
00:47:18.127 --> 00:47:21.427
That's what turns the wrongs all right

898
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:23.091
That's when you can't

899
00:47:23.257 --> 00:47:27.103
Give up the ﬁght

900
00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:31.770
And that's when love
Turns nighttime into day

901
00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:35.527
That's when loneliness goes away

902
00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.108
That's why you gotta

903
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.242
Be strong tonight

904
00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:44.115
<i>'Cause only love can build us</i>

905
00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:48.624
A bridge of light

906
00:47:48.908 --> 00:47:51.036
Only love can build us

907
00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:55.048
A bridge of light

908
00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:59.093
Only love can build us

909
00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:04.181
A bridge of light

910
00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.468
Will? Will?

911
00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:07.430
Hm?

912
00:48:07.593 --> 00:48:09.766
-You asleep yet?
-Mm-hm. Deeply.

913
00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:11.852
Well, then wake up and tell me:

914
00:48:12.014 --> 00:48:13.561
ls that the swarm or am I dreaming?

915
00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:15.476
You're dreaming.

916
00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:27.614
Wow, how wonderful.

917
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.249
I wonder if they're edible.

918
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:39.463
Will, don't you long for the patter
of a thousand tiny little feet?

919
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:42.299
I, for one, don't have the means
to bring up so many kids.

920
00:48:42.461 --> 00:48:43.929
The birthday presents alone...

921
00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:48.184
I've already picked out the names.
Phil, Jill, Lill, Gill, Hil, Billy, Lilly, Willy--

922
00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:50.640
-All right.
-Wilma, Willis, Wilbur, Wilhelmina...

923
00:48:50.803 --> 00:48:51.725
I get the picture.

924
00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:53.230
And there's even a Will.

925
00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:54.390
Good for you.

926
00:48:54.557 --> 00:48:56.184
We could start a little swarm.

927
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.693
We're both males.

928
00:48:57.852 --> 00:48:58.444
We'll adopt.

929
00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:01.401
You adopt, I'll adapt.
I've got slaughtering to do.

930
00:49:01.564 --> 00:49:04.989
Fine, that's just fine! Off you go then.
Quench your blood lust.

931
00:49:05.151 --> 00:49:07.529
There's plenty more krill in the sea.

932
00:49:09.196 --> 00:49:13.076
Plenty of krill would count themselves
lucky to have me as a partner.

933
00:49:13.242 --> 00:49:15.290
I'm a heck of a wingman!

934
00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:29.008
Will.

935
00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:30.510
Will?

936
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.187
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

937
00:49:34.346 --> 00:49:36.064
You're all the swarm I've got.

938
00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:39.193
Suit yourself. But no hanky-panky.

939
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.157
Are you hurt?

940
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.290
No, I'm good. I'm okay. It's okay.

941
00:50:34.448 --> 00:50:36.121
Aw, come on, Seymour, take a break.

942
00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:40.663
No. No, no, thanks, brother.
My boy is out there.

943
00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:46.627
Oh, no.

944
00:50:54.802 --> 00:50:55.974
Erik! Atticus!

945
00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:57.137
Take cover!

946
00:50:57.429 --> 00:50:59.306
Come on, Erik. Over here.

947
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.812
Waddle, waddle, waddle.

948
00:51:04.979 --> 00:51:06.981
Oh, if only I could fly!

949
00:51:07.147 --> 00:51:09.149
Boo-hoo-hoo!

950
00:51:09.358 --> 00:51:10.701
Oh, look at this.

951
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:13.988
My all-time favorite.
Doomed penguin packed in ice.

952
00:51:14.154 --> 00:51:15.201
All you can eat.

953
00:51:15.364 --> 00:51:16.832
Forever.

954
00:51:17.283 --> 00:51:19.502
I've never seen so many skuas
in one place.

955
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.287
Stand together. Hold fast.

956
00:51:21.453 --> 00:51:24.206
-They know. They sense it!
-We're never getting out of here!

957
00:51:24.373 --> 00:51:25.670
They're scavengers. Cowards!

958
00:51:25.833 --> 00:51:27.210
They prey only on the weak.

959
00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:29.378
Admit it, Noah! We're all dead meat!

960
00:51:29.587 --> 00:51:31.339
No! We are Emperor penguins!

961
00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:32.506
Quite right!

962
00:51:32.673 --> 00:51:36.519
Though we stare famine in the face,
we will not yield!

963
00:51:36.677 --> 00:51:38.179
- Ha, ha!
- Though imprisoned...

964
00:51:38.345 --> 00:51:40.689
...on every side
by colossal walls of ice...

965
00:51:40.848 --> 00:51:42.850
...we will not be broken!

966
00:51:43.017 --> 00:51:44.690
Yes, sir. Speak on it, Noah!

967
00:51:44.852 --> 00:51:46.695
We are fortitude!

968
00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:49.198
We are bold defiance!

969
00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:53.156
We are one glorious Emperor nation!

970
00:52:17.051 --> 00:52:18.223
No!

971
00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:35.069
Erik, stay down!

972
00:52:35.736 --> 00:52:37.033
Mumble?

973
00:52:37.404 --> 00:52:38.405
They're okay.

974
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:40.078
Gloria, behind you!

975
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.082
Hey!

976
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.623
Pick on someone your own size, creep!

977
00:52:43.786 --> 00:52:45.208
Oh, I will, princess.

978
00:52:45.371 --> 00:52:47.248
I'll peck on you first.

979
00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:50.167
While you're still fresh.
Before you're stiff and stinky!

980
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.672
Bo!

981
00:53:01.303 --> 00:53:02.600
Bo!

982
00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:26.750
-That's my girl.
-Oh, yeah.

983
00:53:26.912 --> 00:53:28.255
Well done, you.

984
00:53:28.414 --> 00:53:30.087
Ah, the gathering of nations.

985
00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:32.922
Now that's solidarity!

986
00:53:33.293 --> 00:53:34.465
Okay, so....

987
00:53:34.628 --> 00:53:38.383
So they got themselves
a temporary stay...

988
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:39.641
...of execution. Ow!

989
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.017
-What are you?
-An idiot.

990
00:53:41.176 --> 00:53:42.177
Thank you.

991
00:53:42.344 --> 00:53:43.846
Bo! Oh, you did it.

992
00:53:44.012 --> 00:53:44.763
Whoo!

993
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.648
-She is fast.
-Hola, amigos!

994
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.312
-Mumble!
-Mumble!

995
00:53:48.475 --> 00:53:50.318
-You came!
-Of course we came.

996
00:53:50.477 --> 00:53:52.070
-We heard the news.
-Where's Ramon?

997
00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:54.323
-No longer with us.
-He's in a better place.

998
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:55.983
- Next to....
- Carmen!

999
00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:58.402
We got you, man.

1000
00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:01.655
Carmen. Carmen, no. No, wait!

1001
00:54:03.615 --> 00:54:05.993
I wouldn't want you to get cold feet,
my darling.

1002
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.457
I am not your darling.

1003
00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:08.836
See? What did I tell you?

1004
00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:10.964
No backbone. All squishy.

1005
00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:14.172
Hey, back off!
I'm a Carmen-only facility.

1006
00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:15.506
Ramon, it's incredible.

1007
00:54:15.794 --> 00:54:16.841
Everybody came.

1008
00:54:17.004 --> 00:54:18.847
Except for that guy who stayed,
he had the sniffles.

1009
00:54:19.798 --> 00:54:21.015
Oh, no, he's here.

1010
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:22.677
You're a true friend. Thank you.

1011
00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:24.265
I had nothing to do with it.

1012
00:54:24.428 --> 00:54:26.851
Well, then, Lovelace,
thank you so much.

1013
00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:29.525
You got the wrong penguin.

1014
00:54:29.683 --> 00:54:32.027
Hello! Hidy-do-dee-doody there.

1015
00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:34.405
-I knew it.
-Ah, little Ear-rik.

1016
00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:36.398
Excusing me.

1017
00:54:36.565 --> 00:54:40.365
Okay. Friends of Sven, and fans,
and chums and Svenatics!

1018
00:54:40.527 --> 00:54:44.373
We're not going to rest
until everybody fatty!

1019
00:54:44.698 --> 00:54:45.995
Okay.

1020
00:55:22.236 --> 00:55:23.283
Yeah!

1021
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:35.583
Hello!

1022
00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:39.295
Heh, hey! You huddled masses.

1023
00:55:39.461 --> 00:55:44.092
I bring you fish aplenty
courtesy of me!

1024
00:55:44.258 --> 00:55:46.602
Yeah! Give them the real, brother!

1025
00:55:52.474 --> 00:55:53.600
Who is this guy?

1026
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:56.270
They call him Sven. He's Sventastic.

1027
00:55:56.436 --> 00:55:59.280
Let me revert back to
what I previously said before.

1028
00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:00.907
-Ow!
-You're an idiot.

1029
00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:02.780
- And guess what.
- What?

1030
00:56:02.943 --> 00:56:05.617
He can carry more fish
than any penguin that ever...

1031
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:06.371
...existed.

1032
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:07.281
- Ever!
- Wow.

1033
00:56:07.447 --> 00:56:10.291
And it's all due
to his amazingly large red beak.

1034
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:11.576
Impressive.

1035
00:56:11.994 --> 00:56:13.996
Sven? Sven?

1036
00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:14.955
J8? Ja?

1037
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:17.420
There's someone down there
who's very special.

1038
00:56:17.583 --> 00:56:19.927
And knowing Gloria, she won't eat...

1039
00:56:20.085 --> 00:56:21.962
...until everyone else has been fed.
-Aww.

1040
00:56:22.129 --> 00:56:24.473
Do you think you could take this
down to her?

1041
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:26.429
Yeah, don't be silly. Where is he?

1042
00:56:26.592 --> 00:56:28.139
-No, she.
-Oh.

1043
00:56:28.302 --> 00:56:30.179
There, surrounded by the children.

1044
00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:32.014
- That is your spouse? Really?
- Yes.

1045
00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.148
-Your spouse? Wow.
-Here. The fish.

1046
00:56:34.308 --> 00:56:38.313
Oh, no, no, Mumbley.
She deserves the very best.

1047
00:56:38.478 --> 00:56:39.104
A la carte.

1048
00:56:39.855 --> 00:56:42.199
A la me!

1049
00:56:42.983 --> 00:56:44.701
So you want some music?

1050
00:56:44.902 --> 00:56:45.528
Nope.

1051
00:56:45.694 --> 00:56:46.991
Let's have some music.

1052
00:56:47.195 --> 00:56:49.493
A-wake me up before you go-go

1053
00:56:49.656 --> 00:56:52.159
Cause I'm not plannin’ on going solo

1054
00:56:52.326 --> 00:56:54.328
A-wake me up before you go-go

1055
00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:55.495
Can you keep it down?

1056
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:56.663
I wanna hit that high

1057
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.628
Just be quiet!

1058
00:56:58.916 --> 00:57:00.589
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1059
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:04.679
I'm never gonna give you up

1060
00:57:04.838 --> 00:57:06.715
Never gonna let you down

1061
00:57:06.882 --> 00:57:09.010
-Whoa!
-A predator convention?

1062
00:57:09.176 --> 00:57:09.847
Oh, no.

1063
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:11.512
- Why wasn't I invited?
-Will.

1064
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:13.772
- Guys? Guys.
- Will, don't go.

1065
00:57:14.139 --> 00:57:15.686
- Get off.
-You'll never survive.

1066
00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:17.851
- Please.
-Will? Stop!

1067
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.522
I think we should split up.

1068
00:57:21.688 --> 00:57:25.067
Oh, well, I mean, if it's personal space
you want, how's that?

1069
00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:28.954
No, no. I mean, really split up.

1070
00:57:29.237 --> 00:57:31.365
But Why?

1071
00:57:32.366 --> 00:57:35.370
Ah, Bill, this is my life now.

1072
00:57:35.577 --> 00:57:36.874
I can change.

1073
00:57:37.037 --> 00:57:38.710
Be smaller, invisible.

1074
00:57:38.872 --> 00:57:42.922
See? You're gonna be just fine.
I'll see you around, kiddo.

1075
00:57:47.172 --> 00:57:51.723
Will? Please. Don't leave me.

1076
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:57.441
- Aah!
- Wi||! Will!

1077
00:57:57.599 --> 00:58:00.523
Okay, let's take you, you, not you, you.

1078
00:58:00.686 --> 00:58:01.903
Oh, you!

1079
00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:05.737
Please! Somebody! Anybody!

1080
00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:07.242
I've lost my Will!

1081
00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:08.277
I beg you!

1082
00:58:08.443 --> 00:58:12.698
Bring back my Will!

1083
00:58:26.545 --> 00:58:27.592
Mumbley!

1084
00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:29.347
-Ah, Sven.
-Mumb|ey.

1085
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:33.886
-I feed your wife good-y, ja?
-Yeah, thanks.

1086
00:58:34.636 --> 00:58:36.434
Okay, Sven, here we go.

1087
00:58:36.596 --> 00:58:39.065
Okay, single file with a smile.

1088
00:58:39.433 --> 00:58:41.936
So you must be Glorious.

1089
00:58:42.102 --> 00:58:44.150
Heh, heh. And you must be Sven.

1090
00:58:44.312 --> 00:58:46.064
So pleased to meet me. Really...

1091
00:58:46.231 --> 00:58:47.904
...I am delightful.

1092
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:54.581
I bring to you premium seafood, yeah,
from Mumbley.

1093
00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.037
-There he is.
-Hey.

1094
00:58:56.241 --> 00:58:57.493
Via Sven.

1095
00:58:57.659 --> 00:58:58.911
Wow.

1096
00:59:04.833 --> 00:59:06.050
Careful.

1097
00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:07.131
That's my tongue.

1098
00:59:07.294 --> 00:59:10.798
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-That's all right. Whoo!

1099
00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:11.806
Oh, yeah.

1100
00:59:11.965 --> 00:59:14.684
You know, if you are not feeling
a full Svensation...

1101
00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:17.979
...I can get you more.

1102
00:59:19.056 --> 00:59:22.310
No, no, Sven. I'm sure there are
many others hungrier than me.

1103
00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.484
Ah. Such a noble.
See you for supper?

1104
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:28.319
Um, I'm kind of busy.

1105
00:59:28.482 --> 00:59:30.826
Heh. "Kind of busy."

1106
00:59:34.196 --> 00:59:35.869
Oh, you're funny!

1107
00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:39.327
Whoo!

1108
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.878
She is a hottie!

1109
00:59:42.079 --> 00:59:44.002
Honey, are you okay?

1110
00:59:44.456 --> 00:59:47.084
Are you sure he's not related to Ramon?

1111
00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:49.503
Oh, you're funny!

1112
00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:54.008
You shouldn't make fun of someone
just because they're different.

1113
00:59:54.174 --> 00:59:56.302
Especially someone
who's come all this way...

1114
00:59:56.468 --> 00:59:57.970
-...to save us.
-You're right.

1115
00:59:58.136 --> 01:00:02.061
- And when Sven teaches everyone to fly--
-It'll be up-uppity-up.

1116
01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.397
- And out of there.
- You'll see.

1117
01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.478
Hey, who turned off the fish?

1118
01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:09.148
Hey, guys! What's happening to the fish?

1119
01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.776
Yoo-hoo!

1120
01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.035
Fish-y friends!

1121
01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:16.071
What is problem?

1122
01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:20.705
The bird-eaters!

1123
01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:24.379
Svensei! You must fly on the wings
ofhope".

1124
01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:27.257
...and summon them to the aid
of our Emperor brothers!

1125
01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:29.964
You know, I would love to,
but I just hurt my tongue.

1126
01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:31.629
No.

1127
01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:35.428
What?

1128
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.388
- Ciao.
- Hmm. Interesting.

1129
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:39.895
Someone better do something.
They're not stopping.

1130
01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:43.182
Don't worry. I know exactly
how to get the attention...

1131
01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.066
...of our alien benefactors.

1132
01:00:57.028 --> 01:01:00.248
Calm down. Deep breath. Deep breath.

1133
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.322
Lovelace!

1134
01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:22.831
Mumble, my man! I'm the mayor
of Cool Town, population: me!

1135
01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.162
This is great.

1136
01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:33.338
Ah. Can you believe this?

1137
01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.851
Where's there a Will, there's a way out!

1138
01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.277
L-lrn?

1139
01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:08.915
Huh?

1140
01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.813
Bill? ls that you?

1141
01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:41.402
I don't know, Uncle Mumble. They're
noisy and they're messing with our ice.

1142
01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.821
Atticus, they're building us
a way out of here.

1143
01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.239
Oh.

1144
01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:49.619
Everybody who said we'd never
get out of here, take a look!

1145
01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.579
That's our ice road to freedom.

1146
01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:55.965
It won't be long now, boys.

1147
01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.963
I'll miss this place.

1148
01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.629
So where will we live
when everybody gets out?

1149
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.764
We'll find somewhere new, sweetheart.
It's a big world.

1150
01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.767
As long as we're together,
we already home.

1151
01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:07.973
Yeah.

1152
01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:50.095
Come on, everyone. Huddle up.

1153
01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.991
Oh, no, no, no!

1154
01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.339
Carmen, can't you see?

1155
01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.923
Even nature decrees
that we be close together.

1156
01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:53.575
Mm. Yeah.

1157
01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.628
No,no,no.

1158
01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:15.764
Oh, you are still here.

1159
01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:17.807
And you're still here.

1160
01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.226
- They're gone.
- What?

1161
01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.144
A little bad weather, they're gone!

1162
01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.733
- What's going on?
- Who's gone?

1163
01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.239
- The aliens!
- What?

1164
01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.321
All of this flipperizing for nothing!

1165
01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.177
Our alien benefactors...

1166
01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.758
...have abandoned us!

1167
01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.140
They have abandoned us!

1168
01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:52.767
Everybody! Everybody!

1169
01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.930
The sea is frozen over, ja?

1170
01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.939
Impossible for aliens to return!

1171
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.142
Too much ice-y. Too much ice-y.

1172
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:04.313
If the sea so far away,
how we gonna catch food?

1173
01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.732
Yeah, what's the point
of us starving too?

1174
01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:09.447
- I guess we should be going.
- We can't just leave them.

1175
01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.486
- I think they're leaving.
- Who's leaving?

1176
01:07:11.653 --> 01:07:13.997
- It appears that we....
- What is he saying?

1177
01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:15.748
I regret to inform...

1178
01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:19.207
...we are no longer
in the catering businesses.

1179
01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:23.294
Then who will bring us fish?

1180
01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:26.630
Some good questions
have no good answers.

1181
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.264
Sven, they can't leave!

1182
01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.844
Not now!

1183
01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.635
I so sorry, fluffy one. If they stay...

1184
01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:39.264
...then they, too,
become not alive.

1185
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.309
Ah! I can't take it! I can't take it anymore!

1186
01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.398
Out of my way! I'm getting out of here!

1187
01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.780
Whoa, that guy was crazy.

1188
01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.415
Yeah. So am I.

1189
01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.664
Come on, girls. Let's do it.

1190
01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:00.372
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1191
01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.505
Go, go, go!

1192
01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:09.340
Sven. Teach them.
Teach them how to fly!

1193
01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.254
Ear-rik, it's not that easy.

1194
01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.177
Help them, Sven. Help them!

1195
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.763
But not all penguins
created equal, Ear-rik.

1196
01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.678
-But you're a penguin.
_| a__

1197
01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.851
I a little more than penguin.

1198
01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:22.311
I a-- I is a--

1199
01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:24.396
Look! They're halfway there!

1200
01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:25.355
Come on, Sven.

1201
01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.986
Take them high to the sky!

1202
01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:28.856
Do it, Sven!

1203
01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.399
-Do it, brother!
-No, I can't!

1204
01:08:30.565 --> 01:08:32.067
- Do it!
- They're penguins!

1205
01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:33.155
You're a penguin!

1206
01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:34.570
I'm a bird!

1207
01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:35.778
You're a what?

1208
01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:37.288
A bir...den.

1209
01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.575
-What?
-Den. A burden.

1210
01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.835
If <i>I</i> don't try, 1a?

1211
01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.413
Ja, ja, after all...

1212
01:08:44.579 --> 01:08:46.752
- ...it's just technique, right?
- Yes!

1213
01:08:46.914 --> 01:08:48.382
- Yes!
- Okay.

1214
01:08:48.833 --> 01:08:51.177
Everybody! Head up! Back straight!

1215
01:08:54.213 --> 01:08:57.217
Okay. Feel the wind beneath your wings!

1216
01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:58.305
up-uppity-up!

1217
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.144
Oh, boy. Rotate flippers and sing, sing!

1218
01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.620
This time...

1219
01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.999
---v<>u going down, gravity!

1220
01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:23.289
Ja,

1221
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.163
Atticus, my man, I'm coming!

1222
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.251
Fly, Daddy...

1223
01:09:32.418 --> 01:09:33.385
-...f|y!
-Fly!

1224
01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.963
Ja! Ja!

1225
01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:37.841
Come on, guys. Come on.

1226
01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:41.136
If you want it, you must will it!
If you will it, it will be yours!

1227
01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.397
on, Daddy.

1228
01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:58.577
Today is a victory...

1229
01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.372
...for defeat.

1230
01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:05.331
Oh, mighty Sven, you did everything
penguinly possible.

1231
01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:08.042
- I is not a penguin.
- What?

1232
01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:10.002
I is a puffin.

1233
01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:11.799
- Wow.
-Really?

1234
01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:15.508
Ja, just a little puffin bird
run out of poof.

1235
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:16.671
No.

1236
01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:19.261
Bravo, Lovelace.
You brought us a weird bird...

1237
01:10:19.424 --> 01:10:22.644
...and sold him as a penguin.
Ha, ha. Bravo, bravo.

1238
01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:25.305
-Hey. Hey.
-Thank you. I deserved it.

1239
01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.105
I'm sorry, everybody. I'm so sorry.

1240
01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:37.033
But when I lose my homelands...

1241
01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:41.321
...I was very lonely
and very afraid-y.

1242
01:10:41.696 --> 01:10:44.620
And then I meet you
and you believe...

1243
01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:46.076
...in me, Sven.

1244
01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:51.456
Oh. It was nice to have a family.

1245
01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:53.299
Thank you.

1246
01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:58.964
Eh, up-up-UPPitY-

1247
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.459
Hey, guys, we should try this.

1248
01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:33.714
Huh?

1249
01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:35.458
Ah.

1250
01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.047
Okay.

1251
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:43.179
Now, come on. Everyone together.

1252
01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.476
- You know.
- Tippity-tap!

1253
01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.057
- Boomedy-boom!
- Let's do it!

1254
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.939
Come on! Everybody!

1255
01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:52.525
We're doomed and they're dancing?

1256
01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:54.060
Unbelievable.

1257
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.277
That's it.

1258
01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:43.943
Huh?

1259
01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:14.057
Atticus!

1260
01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.691
-Mommy!
-Oh, Boadicea!

1261
01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:17.397
Are you all right?

1262
01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:20.654
Help me!

1263
01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:22.030
Erik!

1264
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:24.988
Help me now! Help me now! He-- Ah!

1265
01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:38.839
- I missed you like crazy.
- My baby.

1266
01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.090
I missed you even more.

1267
01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.628
Ear-rik.

1268
01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:47.223
Hold on, Ear-rik. I'm on my way!

1269
01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:53.896
Erik?

1270
01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:56.274
Bite, Erik! Bite down hard!

1271
01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.608
- Grab it, grab it!
- Use the hips.

1272
01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.489
Now spin around, spin around!

1273
01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:05.116
Almost, almost.

1274
01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.537
- There you go.
- Almost got it!

1275
01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.957
Papa.

1276
01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.789
It's okay, Erik.

1277
01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:18.837
It's okay. I've got you.

1278
01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:22.796
- They're tougher than we think, you know.
- Come on, Erik.

1279
01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.470
Let's go get off this thing.

1280
01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:28.006
Carmen! Carmen!

1281
01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:29.594
Where is Carmen?

1282
01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:32.010
Carmen!

1283
01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:37.141
It's okay, Ramon! I'm fine. I guess.

1284
01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.059
I hate these long-distance relationships!

1285
01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:42.941
- Amigos?
- Yes?

1286
01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:45.448
You must do me a favor.
I count to three.

1287
01:14:45.606 --> 01:14:47.483
- You push me on two.
- He's gonna jump!

1288
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.493
- But don't tell me, okay?
- Hey, hey.

1289
01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.279
- One. Two.
- Ramon, you're crazy!

1290
01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:54.699
Carmen! I'm coming!

1291
01:14:56.826 --> 01:15:00.581
My name is Ramon. Ramon Carlos Garcia
Santa Maria La Niﬁa Pinta Pacifico--

1292
01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:07.007
Ramon. I can't believe you did this.

1293
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:07.920
How could I not?

1294
01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:10.055
But down here, we're doomed.

1295
01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:14.890
A thousand lifetimes up there is nothing
to this one exquisite moment by your side.

1296
01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.814
You are my world entire.

1297
01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.943
You're beautiful.

1298
01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:23.478
Only on the outside.

1299
01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:24.896
No!

1300
01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.281
Why didn't I see this before?

1301
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.737
You're really beautiful.

1302
01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.025
You really think so?

1303
01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.364
Absolutely.

1304
01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:35.828
Ramon, my fallen angel.
You chased me until I caught you.

1305
01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.251
Ay, Ramon, the earth is moving.

1306
01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:47.589
I know. It's amazing.

1307
01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:49.800
No, it's moving for real. Move! Move!

1308
01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:53.386
Keep going. Don't look back.

1309
01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:08.982
Mumble, that thing's on the edge!

1310
01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:10.024
Keep trying!

1311
01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:11.738
All it needs is a nudge!

1312
01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.278
We can do this!

1313
01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:14.286
Okay.

1314
01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.599
- It's just not enough.
- Not enough.

1315
01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:36.759
Uh, Mumbley.

1316
01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.145
-We're not big enough.
-Yeah. My feet hurt.

1317
01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.431
-Excuse me. Mumbley. Mumbley.
-Yeah?

1318
01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:43.774
There's a guy named
Lars Gavunsterson.

1319
01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.482
I used to dance with his sister Girta,
and I--

1320
01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:49.404
Well, anyway, we were two-time
national champion.

1321
01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:51.611
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- Amateur division, so....

1322
01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:54.072
Um.... Look, could I give it a shot?

1323
01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:56.533
Sure, sure. Of course.

1324
01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.789
Attentions! Attentions...

1325
01:16:58.948 --> 01:16:59.870
...everybody!

1326
01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.205
Mumb|ey's foot is very, very hurt-y.

1327
01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:03.415
Yeah, like your brain.

1328
01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.705
But I have song and dance...

1329
01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.214
...from my homelands.

1330
01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:10.001
It's in Svenish,
so join in as best you can.

1331
01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:13.839
Okay! And a-nooney,
and a-dooney and a-vooney!

1332
01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.096
Get off!

1333
01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:28.610
Come on!

1334
01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:38.655
Help!

1335
01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.586
Come on, son. Come on.

1336
01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:47.746
Where are we going?

1337
01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.382
To find us a lot more oomph.

1338
01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:20.788
Where am I?

1339
01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:22.956
Who turned out the lights?

1340
01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.744
ls this the end?

1341
01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.620
I should make out my will.

1342
01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:30.630
I, Willy Williams,
leave everything to my imagination--

1343
01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:34.384
Oh, no. Imagination,
it's the second sign of madness.

1344
01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.386
If only I'd listened to Bill.

1345
01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:39.469
Oh, Bill. I'm so sorry!

1346
01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:40.804
That's okay, Will.

1347
01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:43.640
You were right. I should have
stayed with the swarm.

1348
01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:45.054
No. You were right.

1349
01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.139
Oh, great! I'm talking to myself.

1350
01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:48.353
You're not mad, Will.

1351
01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:51.644
Now I'm seeing things.
What's going on inside my head?!

1352
01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:53.733
- Will?
-Please, make it stop!

1353
01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:54.772
Will!

1354
01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:57.529
Ow!

1355
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.494
Bill? ls it really you?

1356
01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:03.748
Well, there's only one of me in
all the world. You taught me that.

1357
01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.658
Aw, Bill! What are the chances?

1358
01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:07.826
About one in a krillion, Will.

1359
01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.711
Quiet, you two. I'm trying to sleep.

1360
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:11.668
Hey, everyone! It's Will!

1361
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:13.047
Wow, it's him!

1362
01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:14.800
It's wee Willy Williams!

1363
01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:16.256
I thought he'd be taller.

1364
01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:19.046
He's back! Will's back!

1365
01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:22.846
Welcome home, Will.

1366
01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:24.601
But how did you find them?

1367
01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:26.019
They found me.

1368
01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.430
I was on my last nine legs.

1369
01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.189
I was such a fool, Bill.

1370
01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:30.941
Will, you're a legend.

1371
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:34.274
Those days are gone, my friend.
The carnivore is over.

1372
01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:37.030
No. It's because of you we're all here.

1373
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.906
It is?

1374
01:19:38.065 --> 01:19:42.070
I told them how the world really works. How
there were predators, how we had to adapt.

1375
01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:45.365
I led them here, under the great ice.
No one can find us here.

1376
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:49.377
But we're still at the bottom of the food
chain with no significant purpose.

1377
01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:51.082
Well, we all have a purpose.

1378
01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:53.043
Yours is to change the world.

1379
01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:54.707
What possible difference...

1380
01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:55.965
...could one krill make?

1381
01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:59.470
Wait and see, Will. You wait and see.

1382
01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:14.769
-What are you looking at?
-What are you looking at?

1383
01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:16.562
Don't know, but it sure is ugly.

1384
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:18.823
Notice, boys, the witty riposte
as weapon?

1385
01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.733
Right. Outside, now!

1386
01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:22.242
We are outside.

1387
01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:24.027
-Come on, then.
-No...

1388
01:20:24.194 --> 01:20:26.162
- ...you come on.
- Excuse me. Bryan?

1389
01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:27.949
- Huh?
- Down here.

1390
01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:31.244
Ah, g'day, chief.
What are you doing here?

1391
01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.583
Bryan, I need a favor. A big one.

1392
01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:35.123
For you, champ, anything.

1393
01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:36.916
I need you to come to Emperor Land.

1394
01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.255
Bring as many of your kind as you can.

1395
01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.795
- Why?
- To dance.

1396
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.467
You know....

1397
01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.262
Now, why would I wanna do that?

1398
01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:47.301
-To free the penguin nation.
-Oh, yeah?

1399
01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:49.095
-There's been a catastrophe.
-Right.

1400
01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:50.933
The entire population is trapped.

1401
01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:53.440
Uh-huh.
- By huge walls of ice and snow.

1402
01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:54.600
Hey! Bryan!

1403
01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:58.613
Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but
you've come at the worst possible time.

1404
01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.523
Maybe after winter or something, okay?

1405
01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.487
No, that's too late. Way too late.

1406
01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:04.276
Bryan! You gonna fight or what?

1407
01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:06.161
You said you owe me one.

1408
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.288
But right now,
I got problems of me own.

1409
01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:12.202
Everyone's cranky, looking for biff.
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.

1410
01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.457
If you don't come now,
multitudes will die.

1411
01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.420
Here we go. You saying it's my fault now?
Whatever's happening to you penguins...

1412
01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:19.708
...don't blame it on me.

1413
01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:21.635
I'm not. But you can help save them.

1414
01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:25.139
Listen, fella, you look after your kind,
and I'll look after mine.

1415
01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:28.016
If I thought like that,
I would have left you in that hole.

1416
01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:30.598
That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit.
Get off my beach!

1417
01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:32.479
Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you.

1418
01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:33.685
I saved your life!

1419
01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:36.726
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off...

1420
01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.769
...or I'm gonna turn carnivore...

1421
01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.483
...with a craving for penguin.

1422
01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:42.899
-But--
-The only "butt" I wanna see is yours...

1423
01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:45.033
...walking away.

1424
01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:53.493
Come on, son.
We're wasting precious time.

1425
01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:57.329
There's nothing for us here.

1426
01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.671
Now, where was I?

1427
01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.135
-Right here.
-Oh, yeah.

1428
01:22:07.297 --> 01:22:09.174
-What are you looking at?
-What are you?

1429
01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.685
I don't know, but it sure is ugly.

1430
01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:19.359
No, Pa. This is so unfair.

1431
01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:25.615
After all you have done

1432
01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:29.988
You really deserve better

1433
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.039
Nothing makes sense in this world

1434
01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:42.212
It's all a big pile of crazy

1435
01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:54.262
And the kings are all fools

1436
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.972
Hm.

1437
01:22:57.431 --> 01:22:59.058
Where is

1438
01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:03.229
The honor
When a

1439
01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:07.400
Solemn promise

1440
01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:10.570
ls just a pretty lie?

1441
01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:13.451
And the mighty mock

1442
01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:16.584
The courage

1443
01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:22.044
Of the humble?

1444
01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.926
Although he's just

1445
01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:30.180
An ordinary penguin

1446
01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:35.974
My daddy taught me

1447
01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:37.725
You don't need

1448
01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:42.109
To be colossal

1449
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.062
To be a great

1450
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:47.778
Heart

1451
01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:51.072
You don't need

1452
01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:55.536
To ﬂy

1453
01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:59.622
To be awesome

1454
01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:04.290
My hero

1455
01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:09.302
My father

1456
01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.989
Rolling, rolling, rolling

1457
01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.578
Keep moving, moving, moving

1458
01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.664
Keep them doggies moving

1459
01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:44.171
Rawhide

1460
01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:49.005
Rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather

1461
01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:53.513
Wishin’ me girl was by me side

1462
01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.262
Oh, my goodness.

1463
01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:57.677
Mumble.

1464
01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.847
Hey, I know that guy. That's Bryan.

1465
01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.310
<i>Ride</i> 'em <i>in</i>

1466
01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:07.478
Rawhide

1467
01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:09.404
Okay. This 'berg needs to topple.

1468
01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:13.075
Find yourself an elephant seal
and show them the moves.

1469
01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:16.282
Penguin, how's a bit of fancy dancing
gonna move that?

1470
01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:18.539
With enough oomph,
we can shove enough snow.

1471
01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:20.199
Pack it in behind. It'll go.

1472
01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:22.959
It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!

1473
01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.630
Just try it. Hit the beat hard!
And together!

1474
01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.586
I know how to hit things hard, okay?

1475
01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:30.251
-And I'm telling you...
-Come on.

1476
01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:33.591
...the impact force of compact ice
under pressure is equiv--

1477
01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:36.052
Just give it a go, you big wuss!

1478
01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:37.466
Wayne!

1479
01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.243
$32.21.

1480
01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:57.618
Here we go.

1481
01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.406
Now you're talking, Bryan!

1482
01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:09.081
You with me, boys?

1483
01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:11.090
Oh, yeah!

1484
01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:12.459
Pressure

1485
01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:14.761
Pushing down on me

1486
01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:16.680
Pressing down on you

1487
01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.511
No man asks for

1488
01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.596
Under pressure

1489
01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:23.182
That tears a nation down

1490
01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:25.347
Splits a family in two

1491
01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:27.774
Puts people on streets

1492
01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:29.609
People on streets

1493
01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:33.898
People on streets

1494
01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:40.454
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about

1495
01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:43.040
Watching some good friends scream

1496
01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.241
Let me out

1497
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.168
Pray tomorrow

1498
01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:49.626
Take me higher

1499
01:26:49.996 --> 01:26:51.339
Pray tomorrow

1500
01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:55.510
Take me higher

1501
01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:02.055
You hear that? They're doing it again.

1502
01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:04.136
-Doing what?
-This.

1503
01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:05.975
RAUGHS]

1504
01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:08.232
Fascinating. What is it?

1505
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.142
I have no idea.

1506
01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:11.855
Wow! What's it for?

1507
01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:15.443
Perhaps it's a momentary relief
from the existential terrors of existence.

1508
01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:18.905
- Oh. What?
-It brings out my happy.

1509
01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.497
Oh, yes, indeed!

1510
01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:32.001
Hey, Bryan, what are you doing?

1511
01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:35.839
Sometimes you gotta back up
to go forward.

1512
01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:39.756
Tell me why, tell me why

1513
01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:43.016
Give ourselves one more chance

1514
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.179
Why can't we give ourselves
One more chance?

1515
01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:51.395
Why can't we give love
Give love, give love

1516
01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:52.684
Give love

1517
01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:54.523
Every day

1518
01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.438
Every night, every hour

1519
01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:58.528
Yeah, come on! Take it higher!

1520
01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:01.819
Come on, come on! Give love, y'all!
Give love, y'all!

1521
01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:04.864
Hey, get down here.

1522
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:06.532
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

1523
01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:08.700
-Come on!
-Every step counts.

1524
01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.869
To care for

1525
01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:16.418
The people on
The edge of the night

1526
01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:19.553
And love dares you

1527
01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.805
To change our way

1528
01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.715
Of caring

1529
01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:25.805
About ourselves

1530
01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:28.057
This is

1531
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.268
Our last dance

1532
01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:34.568
This is our last dance

1533
01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:39.232
This is ourselves

1534
01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:42.868
Creatures of the world unite
Strength in numbers, we can get it right

1535
01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:44.031
One time

1536
01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:44.740
Yeah!

1537
01:29:30.824 --> 01:29:33.498
- Be careful, Ramon.
-I'm coming. I'm right behind you.

1538
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.459
- Ramon!
- Amigos!

1539
01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:39.298
I'm getting "emotioab|e" again.

1540
01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:41.551
- Come on, Ramon.
- Corning, baby!

1541
01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.212
- Hi, Erik.
-Hello, Bo.

1542
01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.388
Good job, Erik. You too, Uncle Mumble.

1543
01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:47.049
You really something special, brother.

1544
01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.809
One nation, Mumble. One nation.

1545
01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.847
lrie, walking out now, Mumble.
One nation.

1546
01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:54.014
So, boys....

1547
01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:56.308
-Mommy!
-Gloria.

1548
01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:58.234
Where's my hug?

1549
01:30:01.021 --> 01:30:02.238
Oh, my babies.

1550
01:30:02.397 --> 01:30:04.240
Come on, nippers. Let's get youse home.

1551
01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:05.821
Hey, Bryan.

1552
01:30:06.192 --> 01:30:07.068
Cheers.

1553
01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:10.489
No worries, penguin. No worries.

1554
01:30:14.326 --> 01:30:15.669
Yeah.

1555
01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.497
No worries.

1556
01:39:19.996 --> 01:39:22.545
Ja, the Svend.
