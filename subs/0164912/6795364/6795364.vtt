00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:46.421
It's today! It's today!

2
00:00:48.674 --> 00:00:51.009
It's today! It's today!

3
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.180
It's today! It's today! It's today!

4
00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:56.890
It's always today, George.

5
00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:59.393
-I mean, this is the day.
-That's right.

6
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.604
-Can't I come?
-You have to go to school, George.

7
00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:05.941
-Will he be here when I get home?
-I think so.

8
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.860
I'll play ball with him.
I'll wrestle with him.

9
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.071
I'll teach him how to spit.

10
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.699
-It's gonna be so much fun.
-For all of us.

11
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.909
How will you know if you
pick the right one?

12
00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:18.579
I don't know. We'll....

13
00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:20.038
You'll just know.

14
00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.208
Bye, sweetie.

15
00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:31.633
Remember, I want a little brother,
not a big brother.

16
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:40.267
We've been through your paperwork,
and it seems to be in order.

17
00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.311
Adoption isn't for everyone...

18
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.397
...but you seem like people
with plenty of love to share.

19
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:47.649
So how are you feeling?

20
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.110
-Goodness, we're--
-Tingling--

21
00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.737
With anticipation.

22
00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.155
Recess.

23
00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:55.282
Time for you to meet them.

24
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.744
Feel free to walk around.
They're used to having strangers.

25
00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.120
Thank you.

26
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.792
Lovely people.

27
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.600
Nice move, Red.

28
00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:38.158
Oh, Frederick, look at them.

29
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.662
-How could we possibly--?
-Choose? I know.

30
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.081
-They all seem so--
-Wonderful.

31
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.541
You know what's wonderful?

32
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.210
What's wonderful is...

33
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.380
...how you both know what
the other one is gonna say...

34
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.382
...before you even say it.

35
00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.678
Not that it's any of my business.

36
00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:02.849
Yes, that happens when you've
been together as long as we have.

37
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.393
From being a family.

38
00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:07.396
Family. Wow.

39
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:11.817
Well, for a family, you've certainly
come to the right place.

40
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:15.696
I think we can find just
what you're looking for.

41
00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.240
If you want a girl,
Susan can read French.

42
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.743
And Edith over there can tap-dance
while blowing bubbles.

43
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.496
Or maybe you wanted a boy.

44
00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:27.040
Actually, we were
leaning towards a boy.

45
00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:28.750
Well, in that case...

46
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.003
...Benny can do handstands.

47
00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:35.424
Andy can run 100 yards faster than
you can say, "Ready, set, go."

48
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.884
You certainly know
a lot about everyone.

49
00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:41.388
That's what happens when
you've been here as long as I have.

50
00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:46.393
Let's face it. Not everyone
wants to adopt someone like me.

51
00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.813
You shouldn't worry about choosing.

52
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.857
It happens the same way every time.

53
00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:55.152
First, you won't know what to do.
You'll be a bit scared.

54
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.070
Then you'll meet one of them.

55
00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.697
You'll talk to him.

56
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.240
Somehow...

57
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.242
...you just know.

58
00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.756
Are you quite certain you're prepared
to handle his uniqueness?

59
00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.133
Oh, my, yes.

60
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.678
His uniqueness is a perfect fit
for the Little family.

61
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:26.683
Mr. and Mrs. Little,
we try to discourage couples...

62
00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.686
...from adopting children
outside their own...

63
00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:33.273
...species.

64
00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.650
It rarely works out.

65
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:37.986
Well, it will in this case.

66
00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:06.431
Bye, Stuart!

67
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.767
Bye! We'll miss you!

68
00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.108
So what do I call you?

69
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.652
-Mom.
-And Dad.

70
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.655
We haven't told you the best news.
You have a brother.

71
00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.031
Named George.

72
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.407
A brother!

73
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.369
-What do I call him?
-George.

74
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.586
Well, Stuart, here we are,
the family home.

75
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.297
They say every Little
can find this house.

76
00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:22.173
Even if they've never been here.

77
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.093
It's just something inside them.

78
00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.354
Something inside.

79
00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.107
So would you like a tour?

80
00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.109
I don't have any money.

81
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.822
That's Uncle Crenshaw,
Cousin Edgar, Grandpa Spencer.

82
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:47.574
That's Aunt Beatrice...

83
00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:50.118
...and that's George, your brother.

84
00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.288
Look, he's already happy to see me.

85
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.043
That's just about everybody,
except for--

86
00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:02.881
Snowbell! Drop him right now!

87
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.133
You spit Stuart out this instant.

88
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:09.262
Stuart, are you all right?

89
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.847
Wait!

90
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:13.934
I'm fine.

91
00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.144
You must never harm Stuart.
Understand?

92
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.939
Never, or out you'll go, Mr. Snow.

93
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.900
Stuart is family now.
We do not eat family members.

94
00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.069
Mom, Dad, I'm home!

95
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.364
Is my brother here?

96
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.658
-He certainly is.
-Where is he?

97
00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:32.577
He's here. Stuart, this is George.

98
00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:36.581
George, this is Stuart,
your new brother.

99
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.459
No. Really?

100
00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.879
Really, George.
This is your new brother.

101
00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.841
You look somewhat like a mouse.

102
00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:50.845
Yeah, well, I am somewhat
like a mouse.

103
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.514
I see.

104
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.307
I have to go.

105
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:08.113
Is it just me, or did he seem
a little disappointed?

106
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.117
Well, he's always
a little tired after school.

107
00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:14.369
Perks up around dinnertime.

108
00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.212
Meat loaf is delicious, dear.

109
00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.714
Cajun.

110
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:30.677
Shall we get to know
each other a little?

111
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:34.014
George? Don't you have anything
you wanna ask Stuart?

112
00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.933
Sure, George. Go ahead.
I'm an open book.

113
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:40.437
Ask me anything, the first thing
that pops into your head.

114
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.230
Could you pass the gravy?

115
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.988
-Your new bedroom.
-We hope you like it.

116
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.699
Sure is roomy.

117
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.084
Good night, Mom.

118
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.087
Good night, Dad.

119
00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:09.382
-Good night, son.
-Good night, sweetie.

120
00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:38.495
Nice kitty.

121
00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.288
Nice kitty. Pretty kitty.

122
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:43.458
Are you cozy?

123
00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.003
Yes, thanks.
I'm quite comfortable.

124
00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.090
All I've got to sleep on is a rag,
you little rat!

125
00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.134
-You seem tense.
-Tense?

126
00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.303
I'm way past tense.

127
00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:57.430
Well, maybe I can help.

128
00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:00.809
What do you like?
Can I scratch your ears?

129
00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:02.894
I could rub your tummy.

130
00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.230
How'd you like to rub it
from the inside?

131
00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:09.317
I'm confused. I thought
that's what you do with a pet.

132
00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.611
A pet? I am not your pet!

133
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.572
I'm a cat. You're a mouse.
You should live in a hole.

134
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.449
This is my family.

135
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.284
Can't we share them?

136
00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:21.996
Read my furry pink lips: No.

137
00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.959
I can't believe this.
I'm arguing with lunch.

138
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.460
Stay away from the windows.

139
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:30.421
The other cats find out about this,
I'm ruined.

140
00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.926
I gotta relax.
Where's my tinkle ball?

141
00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.558
George? Time to get up.

142
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.143
Okay, Mom.

143
00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:45.687
Stuart, you too.

144
00:10:45.937 --> 00:10:47.355
Okay, Mom.

145
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:40.491
George, I'm trying to get
the laundry started.

146
00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.248
In the laundry chute, please!

147
00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:55.757
Thank you.

148
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.601
Oh, dear.

149
00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.021
Mom! Hello! Mom!

150
00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:13.566
It's Stuart! I'm in
the washing machine. Mom!

151
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:15.610
Hello, Mom!

152
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.368
Where are you going?

153
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.297
-That's odd.
-What is?

154
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:40.176
-I thought someone was at the door.
-You look beautiful, dear.

155
00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:44.514
Honey, should we talk
to George before you go?

156
00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.683
-About what?
-About Stuart.

157
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.894
He hasn't exactly
embraced the situation.

158
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.021
Snowbell!
Thank goodness you're here.

159
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.399
I'm locked in the washer!

160
00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.485
Can you help me?
Can you turn this thing off?

161
00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:00.905
Why would I turn it off?

162
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.491
It's my favorite show.

163
00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:07.996
That's funny.
That's funny, Snowbell.

164
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.623
-You can't leave me!
-Talk to the butt.

165
00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.208
Where are you going?

166
00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.836
I've gotta stare at traffic,
yawn, lick myself.

167
00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:18.047
And believe me, that could
take hours if you do it right.

168
00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:19.507
Ciao!

169
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.095
Are you sure that
Stuart is happy here?

170
00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:26.139
He's having the time of his life.

171
00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:29.517
Help! Somebody, please help me!

172
00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.156
Hi, Stuart.

173
00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:51.664
Stuart, where are you?

174
00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.505
Stuart, are you all right?

175
00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:02.467
I'm okay, Mom. I'm--

176
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.695
Is he gonna be all right?

177
00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:26.783
Well, a lad that size
swallowing all that detergent....

178
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.744
Amazingly, I think he's gonna be fine.

179
00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.998
Also he's very clean.

180
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.715
-Glad you're feeling better.
-Me too.

181
00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.259
We'll pick out a whole new wardrobe.

182
00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:47.428
Here you go.

183
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.393
Come on, George. This'll be fun.

184
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.437
I don't wanna go shopping with Stuart.

185
00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.565
-You should--
-Talk to him. You're right.

186
00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:05.613
So, George, I wanted to talk
to you about Stuart.

187
00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:09.409
I just want you to know that
if you and he were to spend...

188
00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.036
...some real time together,
brother time--

189
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:13.413
Look at that one.

190
00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.709
Come on, George.
You have a boat, a beautiful one.

191
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.253
It's not finished.

192
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.922
You better get moving.
The race is soon.

193
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:24.424
So?

194
00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.428
Don't you want to race your boat?

195
00:15:28.845 --> 00:15:31.639
-I'm not so good at the racing part.
-So what?

196
00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:35.643
It doesn't matter about winning.
You try like heck, and you have fun.

197
00:15:36.144 --> 00:15:38.146
It's fun to finish last?

198
00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:42.275
Something formal, I should think.

199
00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:45.153
I'm not sure of the fabric,
but it should breathe.

200
00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.447
He has a tendency
to burrow and climb...

201
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.740
...and generally scurry about.

202
00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:54.162
Well, I'm sure we can find something
to suit your particular need.

203
00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.000
Here we have Barbados Ben.

204
00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:01.961
Chef Ben.

205
00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:05.673
Lumberjack Ben.

206
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.384
And, of course, Gladiator Ben.

207
00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:15.600
-Does Ben always dress like this?
-No, madam.

208
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.977
There are many moods of Ben...

209
00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.397
...and it all depends on the occasion.

210
00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:26.027
Well, what if the occasion were
a simple family party?

211
00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.779
I think I have just the thing.

212
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.034
There they are.

213
00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:39.415
George?

214
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:43.211
Shopping?

215
00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:47.215
-Everything all right in there?
-Don't come in.

216
00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:49.217
Shy.

217
00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.138
How do I look?

218
00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:57.350
-Fantastic. I hardly recognize you.
-Very smart.

219
00:16:57.558 --> 00:16:59.018
You look just like a Little.

220
00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.354
I do?

221
00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.147
Good.

222
00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:06.150
I was worried
I was gonna look just like Ben.

223
00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:15.701
Hi, auntie.

224
00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:19.080
-Crenshaw!
-Frederick!

225
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.540
Little high, Little low.

226
00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:22.917
Little hey, Little ho!

227
00:17:24.585 --> 00:17:26.754
We come bearing gifts
for young Stuart.

228
00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.506
Where is my new nephew?

229
00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.342
The Little family's getting
bigger and bigger.

230
00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.470
Boy.

231
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.975
That's a lot of Littles.

232
00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.352
Uncle Crenshaw!

233
00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.525
There's my favorite little nephew.

234
00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.944
You can't say that anymore,
Crenshaw.

235
00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:52.780
Right. Now we have two
favorite little nephews.

236
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.367
-Where is the lad?
-He has a lot of gifts to open.

237
00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:58.452
Are any of those for me?

238
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.213
Attention, everybody.

239
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.716
We'd like to introduce you
to someone.

240
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.593
This is Stuart.

241
00:18:21.642 --> 00:18:24.103
Hello, everyone.

242
00:18:29.525 --> 00:18:32.278
-He's a-- A--
-Adorable!

243
00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.405
-Adorable.
-Yeah, that's right.

244
00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.157
I couldn't think of the word.

245
00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.245
Oh, Stuart, look.

246
00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:45.458
Look at that.
This is a real Schmelling.

247
00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:48.336
-Those are the best kind.
-You know what they say:

248
00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.631
-"If it ain't Schmelling...."
-"It ain't bowling."

249
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.466
Look here, Stuart.

250
00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:57.678
Climb on up here, son.
Plant your caboose right up here.

251
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.313
He may have to grow into it.

252
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.191
I think he's grown a little
since we've been here.

253
00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:14.612
That's what happened to me.
One summer, I just shot right up.

254
00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:18.658
May I say something?

255
00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.870
In the orphanage,
we used to tell fairy tales...

256
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.332
...of finding our families
and having a party like this.

257
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:30.670
A party with cakes and presents
and all varieties of meat loaf.

258
00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:34.715
A party with a big family who came
from far away just to wish us well.

259
00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:37.510
I don't know much about families...

260
00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.554
...but this must be
the nicest family in the world.

261
00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.724
So I just wanted to thank each of you.

262
00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.893
Because now I know...

263
00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:48.145
...fairy tales are real.

264
00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:51.732
Fairy tales are real?

265
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.653
I think I'm gonna cough up a furball.

266
00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.031
Now it's time for the best present.

267
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.742
It's something for you and George.

268
00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.330
Stand next to Stuart.

269
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:10.126
This is something that
gave your father and me...

270
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:12.753
...hours of enjoyment
when we were young brothers...

271
00:20:13.045 --> 00:20:14.755
...just like you and Stuart.

272
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.137
This ball...

273
00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:24.223
...belonged to your
great-great-grandfather...

274
00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.726
...Jedediah Little.

275
00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:33.149
Remember, Frederick, those
long summer days playing catch?

276
00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:37.069
Take your brother outside
and toss around the old horsehide.

277
00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.155
What do you say? You ready?

278
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.198
Are you all nuts?

279
00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:43.409
Bicycles and bowling balls?

280
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:48.080
How will he toss a baseball?
How will he do any of those things?

281
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:50.666
He's not my brother. He's a mouse.

282
00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:57.798
-Time to go.
-Excellent idea.

283
00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:15.816
What, what? Where?

284
00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:22.740
Did I hurt you? What's the matter?

285
00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:27.953
I just wanted to ask you something,
but you were already asleep.

286
00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.581
-What did you want to ask?
-About my real family.

287
00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:32.833
You know, the ones I look like.

288
00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:36.796
He hates us.

289
00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:39.924
We've never been hated before.

290
00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:43.010
No, it's not that. It's not that at all.

291
00:21:43.594 --> 00:21:45.012
It's just that...

292
00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.932
...something's missing.

293
00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:51.018
I feel an empty space inside me...

294
00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:53.312
...and I want to know
what was there before.

295
00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:55.856
You have an empty space.

296
00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.442
That's so sad.

297
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:03.155
Oh, dear. I hope I haven't left you
dismayed and disappointed.

298
00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:05.032
-No, don't, no.
-No.

299
00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:07.117
We don't feel dismayed
and disappointed.

300
00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:08.869
Not at all.

301
00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:10.246
Are you sure?

302
00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:11.872
We're certain, Stuart.

303
00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:16.001
And if you want us to, we'll find out
about your real parents.

304
00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.631
Well, good night then.

305
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:32.393
Out of the question.
It's against the rules.

306
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:36.313
Besides, it's very hard
to track mouse families.

307
00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:38.816
They're not very good with paperwork.

308
00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:41.402
But he has an empty space.

309
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.780
Are there problems with Stuart?

310
00:22:45.406 --> 00:22:48.409
Problem--? No, not at all.

311
00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:51.245
-Well, there's been a few....
-Difficulties.

312
00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:52.538
Difficulties?

313
00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:56.750
Well, like the cat trying to eat him
when we first brought him home.

314
00:22:57.001 --> 00:23:00.045
He spat the boy out, of course,
in one heck of a jiffy.

315
00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:04.008
Mrs. Keeper....

316
00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.803
He wants to know about his family.

317
00:23:08.012 --> 00:23:10.180
Any child would have
questions about that.

318
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.517
Yes.

319
00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.577
Hey, Snow?

320
00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.872
I know that you and I
got off on the wrong paw.

321
00:23:35.122 --> 00:23:37.917
I just wanted to see
if we could start out fresh.

322
00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:39.627
You know? Clean slate.

323
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.546
What do you say? Wanna be friends?

324
00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:45.966
No.

325
00:23:48.052 --> 00:23:49.303
Okay then.

326
00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:53.641
He's playing with my head.
He's trying to psych me out.

327
00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.267
Sick little rodent!

328
00:23:55.476 --> 00:23:58.979
Snow, let me in! I'm starving!
What's in the dish today?

329
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:01.148
Oh, no. Monty the Mouth.

330
00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:04.485
If he sees Stuart, it'll be
all over the neighborhood.

331
00:24:05.443 --> 00:24:06.904
Go away! There's no food.

332
00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.155
Please.

333
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:13.160
I'm not picky,
as long as it ain't meat loaf.

334
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.579
That stuff gives me gas
something awful.

335
00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:17.331
Sorry, it's meat loaf.

336
00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:20.584
Beggars can't be choosers.
Load me up and light a match.

337
00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:23.128
No, Monty. Stop.
You don't wanna do that.

338
00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:25.923
I eat from garbage cans,
drink from public toilets.

339
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:27.925
Like a little gas will bother me.

340
00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:29.677
No, wait. Don't!

341
00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:32.304
Oh, great.
What am I gonna tell him now?

342
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.684
Monty, I can explain.

343
00:24:37.518 --> 00:24:39.186
-He's....
-Explain what?

344
00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:42.272
Explain that you should
stuff your face.

345
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.024
Oh, thanks.

346
00:24:47.027 --> 00:24:49.487
I don't wanna rush you,
but you have to leave.

347
00:24:49.697 --> 00:24:53.491
The Littles are due back, and they
don't like strange cats in the house.

348
00:24:53.701 --> 00:24:55.493
Not that you're strange.

349
00:24:57.705 --> 00:25:01.166
-Snow, what's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

350
00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:05.421
You're the one acting strange.
What is it? Worms? Fleas?

351
00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:07.297
Yeah, you look pale.

352
00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:09.299
Maybe you should see a vet.

353
00:25:09.507 --> 00:25:11.844
A vet? What a swell idea.

354
00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:14.221
Do you know one?
I'm not happy with mine.

355
00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:16.724
He makes us wait,
and his hands are cold.

356
00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:19.226
-What was that?
-What was that what?

357
00:25:19.435 --> 00:25:21.395
What was that-- What?

358
00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:25.357
Well, I hate to eat and run.

359
00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:27.568
No, please. By all means, run.

360
00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:29.319
Run like the wind!

361
00:25:30.863 --> 00:25:32.865
Phew, that was gross.

362
00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:36.534
Snow, I almost forgot to thank you.

363
00:25:41.415 --> 00:25:42.499
What the...?

364
00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:44.835
Oh, no.

365
00:25:52.176 --> 00:25:54.219
Oh, my pants.

366
00:25:54.428 --> 00:25:56.972
They're putting
some wild prizes in there.

367
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:03.479
Hello. You must be
a friend of Snowbell's.

368
00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:06.065
-I'm Stuart.
-Aren't you gonna run?

369
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.524
Why?

370
00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:09.359
Because you're a mouse.

371
00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.403
I'm not just a mouse.

372
00:26:11.612 --> 00:26:13.781
I'm also a member of this family.

373
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.118
A mouse with a pet cat.

374
00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:23.499
A mouse with a pet cat!

375
00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:27.419
I guess that is pretty funny.

376
00:26:27.628 --> 00:26:31.215
Pretty funny?!
I'm gonna wet my fur!

377
00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:34.009
A mouse with a pet cat!

378
00:26:34.802 --> 00:26:36.804
Your new little master.

379
00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:39.306
Wait till the boys hear about this.

380
00:26:40.974 --> 00:26:42.226
The humiliation.

381
00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:45.603
I'm gonna kill you!

382
00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:49.441
Come back here!

383
00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:13.340
All right. No more Mr. Nice Kitty.

384
00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:15.342
You!

385
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:19.847
You can't go in there.

386
00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:22.474
That's George's room!
Come back. Come on out.

387
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:23.934
I won't hurt you.

388
00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:26.186
I just wanna show you something.

389
00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:45.497
What are you doing here?

390
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:50.377
I just thought I'd drop in.

391
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.339
Did you build these?

392
00:27:54.715 --> 00:27:56.300
Me and my dad.

393
00:27:57.634 --> 00:28:00.846
This is incredible. It's like
being in a real live Western.

394
00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:02.680
Howdy, partner.

395
00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.894
Draw, you lily-livered, yellow-bellied
son-of-a-one-eyed prairie dog.

396
00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:12.357
I'm trying to concentrate.

397
00:28:13.901 --> 00:28:14.902
Sorry.

398
00:28:19.907 --> 00:28:20.908
Is that a train?

399
00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:23.493
What's it look like, picklehead?

400
00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:27.998
Could we play with it?
Please, please, please?

401
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:36.048
Help! Somebody help me!

402
00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:39.718
Help! Please!

403
00:28:39.927 --> 00:28:41.637
Somebody help me!

404
00:28:49.186 --> 00:28:52.272
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
-You're crazy.

405
00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:54.358
I have an idea.

406
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:09.414
Hop in.

407
00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:17.381
A roadster.

408
00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:19.967
Go ahead, check it out.

409
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.101
Stuart, what's wrong?

410
00:29:30.102 --> 00:29:31.311
Nothing....

411
00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:36.400
It's the first time I've fit in
since I got here.

412
00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:40.487
What's that?

413
00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:43.907
Oh, that.

414
00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:46.493
That's the Wasp.

415
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:54.459
She is beautiful.

416
00:29:54.668 --> 00:29:57.796
-But she's not finished.
-When are you gonna finish it?

417
00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:01.925
Me and my dad were building her,
but I decided to stop.

418
00:30:02.134 --> 00:30:03.260
How come?

419
00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.429
I'm too little for a race like that.

420
00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:07.806
Little? You're not little.

421
00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:09.433
Well, not to me.

422
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:12.144
You've never seen
one of these races.

423
00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:15.188
There's hundreds of people there.
Everybody from school.

424
00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:17.524
I mean...

425
00:30:18.025 --> 00:30:19.526
...what if you lost?

426
00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:23.363
At least you'll have been somewhere.

427
00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:28.285
Come on, George.
What do you say?

428
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.330
Let's get started.

429
00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:33.957
You know...

430
00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:36.376
...I'm not sure I want a brother.

431
00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:40.213
How about a friend?

432
00:30:41.465 --> 00:30:43.884
I guess I can always use a friend.

433
00:30:46.303 --> 00:30:47.637
-George?
-Yes, Dad?

434
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.139
Have you seen Stuart?

435
00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:51.350
He's down here with me.

436
00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:53.310
What are you doing to him?

437
00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:57.314
He's helping me finish the Wasp.

438
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.360
That's wonderful, son.

439
00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:02.861
That's terrific.

440
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.321
Can't race her like this.

441
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:06.365
-Right, George?
-Right.

442
00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:08.367
-When's the next race?
-Two days.

443
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:11.370
-Two days?
-We'll be ready.

444
00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:13.997
-Let's all go together.
-That's a wonderful idea.

445
00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:16.666
-That would be great.
-All of us together.

446
00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.293
The whole family.

447
00:31:18.835 --> 00:31:21.588
The whole family.

448
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:27.344
I'm telling you, Snowy,
this guy can fix anything.

449
00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:31.431
But they're alley cats: mean,
vicious and all hopped up on catnip.

450
00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:34.684
Quit being a scaredy-cat.
You wanna get rid of the mouse?

451
00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:35.894
Of course I do.

452
00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:37.521
All right then.

453
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:38.897
Hey, Smokey!

454
00:31:39.106 --> 00:31:41.817
Smokey, it's me. It's me, Monty.

455
00:31:42.025 --> 00:31:43.026
What is it now?

456
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.904
Well, my friend Snowbell here
needs a favor.

457
00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:47.447
Snowbell?

458
00:31:48.115 --> 00:31:49.449
There's a manly name.

459
00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:53.120
You see, sir, I've got this mouse
at home I can't eat.

460
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.704
Sensitive stomach?

461
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:59.584
No. I can't eat him, because
he's a member of the family.

462
00:32:00.127 --> 00:32:01.628
A mouse with a pet cat?

463
00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:03.463
Isn't that funny?

464
00:32:04.297 --> 00:32:05.424
That's not funny.

465
00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:08.051
That's sick.

466
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.470
A cat can't have
a rodent for a master.

467
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.640
I mean, it's against
the laws of nature.

468
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.643
Word of this gets out,
it'll be bad for cats all over.

469
00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:18.145
Can you help me?

470
00:32:18.353 --> 00:32:19.980
Consider it done.

471
00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:23.942
Did you hear that, Monty?
Thank you, Mr. Smokey, sir.

472
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:25.986
I'll never forget this. Really.

473
00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:28.780
Don't worry, Tinkerbell.
I'm all over it.

474
00:32:30.157 --> 00:32:33.076
Tinkerbell! He called me Tinkerbell.

475
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:35.120
-You're a funny guy.
-Whatever.

476
00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:37.622
Jeez, house cats.

477
00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:40.167
He'll keep this hush-hush?

478
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:42.794
You kidding? Cat's got his tongue.
Get it?

479
00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:45.130
Cat's got his tongue
because he's a cat.

480
00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:46.923
-Shut up.
-Okay.

481
00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:52.179
Ahoy, fellow yachtsmen!

482
00:32:52.429 --> 00:32:55.348
And welcome, everyone,
to the 92nd annual...

483
00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:57.517
...Central Park Boat Race...

484
00:32:57.767 --> 00:33:01.813
...undoubtedly model racing's
most prestigious event.

485
00:33:02.022 --> 00:33:05.025
Children from all over New York
gather here every year...

486
00:33:05.275 --> 00:33:07.194
...to see whose boat will prevail.

487
00:33:07.694 --> 00:33:11.823
Who will win the race and
take home the magnificent trophy?

488
00:33:13.283 --> 00:33:15.785
-Anchor up?
-Check.

489
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:18.663
-Stays all battened?
-Check.

490
00:33:18.872 --> 00:33:20.999
-Rudder?
-Check.

491
00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:23.126
-Sail?
-Check.

492
00:33:26.213 --> 00:33:27.297
They're doing checks.

493
00:33:27.506 --> 00:33:29.674
George, Stuart,
would you like a hot dog?

494
00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:31.051
-Check.
-Check.

495
00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:33.720
And from Manhattan's
Upper West Side...

496
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.140
...the Wasp,
piloted by George Little.

497
00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:39.518
Everything seems shipshape.

498
00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:42.854
But to be on the safe side,
I'll check for leaks.

499
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:49.402
Oh, no. Anton.

500
00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:54.741
Gee, George, what did you do?
Get that out of a cereal box?

501
00:33:56.243 --> 00:33:57.911
I'm glad you're here, George.

502
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:00.539
Someone's gotta finish last.

503
00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:06.336
I don't like that child.

504
00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:08.713
All set to get under way.

505
00:34:17.597 --> 00:34:21.393
It's time to get those boats
in the water and grab your remote.

506
00:34:21.601 --> 00:34:23.478
Stuart, could you get the remote?

507
00:34:23.687 --> 00:34:24.771
Aye, aye, captain.

508
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:42.330
Doesn't she look great?

509
00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:50.255
Are you okay?

510
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.508
-Maybe we should go home.
-Why?

511
00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.760
I'm not wearing my lucky underwear.

512
00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:57.846
You don't have lucky underwear.

513
00:34:58.054 --> 00:35:01.808
Maybe we should get some
and then come back for another race.

514
00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:15.238
Listen, I know how worried you are
about losing, believe me.

515
00:35:15.822 --> 00:35:18.408
But you know what we say?
The thing that matters...

516
00:35:18.658 --> 00:35:21.536
...is to never stop trying. Okay?

517
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:24.164
That's the spirit.

518
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.670
Everyone to your places.
The race is about to start.

519
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:36.092
Where's Stuart?

520
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:40.096
Look out, sir!

521
00:35:45.685 --> 00:35:47.771
Stuart, are you hurt?

522
00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:51.483
-What happened?
-It was my fault. I couldn't grip it.

523
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.485
Nice going, Captain Loser.

524
00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:02.202
George, wait.

525
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:06.581
Oh, honey.
Everything will be all right.

526
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.458
No, it won't.

527
00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:14.089
Maybe we could fix it.
A little glue. Who'll know?

528
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:15.965
Mom.

529
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:21.680
This is awful. Our first family outing.
I ruined everything.

530
00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:25.308
Well, you know, Stuart...

531
00:36:26.226 --> 00:36:27.644
...these things happen.

532
00:36:28.478 --> 00:36:30.814
But what about George?

533
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:35.151
I'll be back.

534
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.495
George, you know what?

535
00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:47.414
Just because we can't be
in the race...

536
00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:50.166
...doesn't mean our family outing
has to be ruined.

537
00:36:50.917 --> 00:36:55.380
All boats to your marks.
Ready, and....

538
00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.134
And the race is on.

539
00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:01.720
We should just go home.

540
00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:06.141
The sails are full and--
There's a mouse on that boat?

541
00:37:15.775 --> 00:37:18.862
-What are you doing?
-Sailing. I hope.

542
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.321
Stuart, come back here.

543
00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.906
-I can't.
-Why not?

544
00:37:22.157 --> 00:37:23.575
I don't know how!

545
00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:26.745
The players are jockeying
for position.

546
00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.164
Frederick, I don't like this one bit.

547
00:37:29.414 --> 00:37:31.082
Your mother doesn't like this.

548
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:33.168
I'm okay, Mom!

549
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:34.669
Go, Stuart!

550
00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:36.254
Tighten the mainsail!

551
00:37:36.463 --> 00:37:37.922
What's a mainsail?

552
00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:45.388
Move!

553
00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:48.141
Come on, Stuart!

554
00:37:48.475 --> 00:37:51.436
-Gee, George, you all done crying?
-Yeah.

555
00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:54.939
-You all done being a jerk?
-No.

556
00:37:55.148 --> 00:37:57.317
Don't worry, George!
I won't let you down!

557
00:37:57.567 --> 00:38:00.403
Away those boats are sailing....

558
00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:14.626
What if he falls?

559
00:38:14.834 --> 00:38:17.337
Remember,
he's quite a fine swimmer.

560
00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:40.109
That's cheating. You can't do that.

561
00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.529
Well, I just did.

562
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.536
Oh, dear.

563
00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:27.657
-What is he doing?
-I think he's hiking out.

564
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.882
Hope that mouse can swim.

565
00:39:46.593 --> 00:39:48.803
-Wasp is taking the lead.
-Look out!

566
00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:03.067
That can't be good.

567
00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:05.695
Look what that stupid mouse did!

568
00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:07.405
He's not a stupid mouse.

569
00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:09.866
You're right. He's a stupid rat.

570
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:22.253
-Hey, come on.
-Get off me. Get off!

571
00:40:44.984 --> 00:40:46.569
Something's wrong.

572
00:40:47.946 --> 00:40:49.280
What's happening?

573
00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:26.859
Who is that mouse anyway?

574
00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:29.988
That's no mouse.
That's my brother.

575
00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:46.921
Little high, Little low!

576
00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:48.965
Little hey, Little ho!

577
00:41:52.468 --> 00:41:54.721
Frederick, look at them.

578
00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:03.521
You know what?
This calls for a picture.

579
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:15.450
-What's wrong?
-Well, it's just...

580
00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:18.911
...you four look great together.

581
00:42:21.372 --> 00:42:23.833
This is the happiest moment
of my life.

582
00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:27.086
I feel 10 inches tall.

583
00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:33.926
I'll get that.

584
00:42:37.597 --> 00:42:39.474
-Mr. Little.
-Yes?

585
00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:41.100
Down here.

586
00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:43.853
Sorry to disturb you at your abode.

587
00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:46.105
I hope we're not intruding.

588
00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:49.609
My name's Reginald Stout.
This is my wife, Camille.

589
00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:51.527
An extreme pleasure.

590
00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:53.404
We're looking for Stuart.

591
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.531
Are you friends of his?

592
00:42:55.782 --> 00:42:57.909
Well, not exactly.

593
00:42:58.117 --> 00:43:00.536
-Fellow yachtsmen?
-Guess again.

594
00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:02.455
Reggie, just tell them.

595
00:43:03.122 --> 00:43:04.457
We're his parents.

596
00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:18.805
Reggie, stop it!

597
00:43:23.935 --> 00:43:26.395
It's so good to see you again, Stuart.

598
00:43:26.979 --> 00:43:29.440
There's so much
we have to catch up on.

599
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:33.069
Why didn't you want me?

600
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:38.616
It shames me to say this, but you
weren't born into a prosperous home.

601
00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:41.953
That's right.
We couldn't feed you, dear.

602
00:43:42.161 --> 00:43:44.539
Couldn't feed him?
How much could he eat?

603
00:43:44.789 --> 00:43:45.998
George, please.

604
00:43:46.249 --> 00:43:50.128
Letting you go was
the toughest choice we ever made.

605
00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:52.338
-It was?
-Yes.

606
00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:54.966
But now we can be a family again.

607
00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:57.677
Absolutely. Are these salted?

608
00:44:00.263 --> 00:44:02.974
Dear. The children.

609
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:07.478
George, Stuart, I think we need
to talk to the Stouts alone.

610
00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:14.193
Don't worry. Mom and Dad
will take care of it.

611
00:44:19.574 --> 00:44:22.285
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

612
00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:25.204
Stuart can't leave with you. He's--

613
00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:26.998
-One of the family.
-Exactly.

614
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:30.710
You may feel like he's family,
but he'll never really be family.

615
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.173
You may not realize it,
but I'm sure he does.

616
00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:39.385
There's something you'll never be able
to give him, because you're human.

617
00:44:39.635 --> 00:44:42.054
It's a place that
you can never fill.

618
00:44:43.598 --> 00:44:45.391
An empty space.

619
00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:48.853
Mom...

620
00:44:49.729 --> 00:44:52.064
...Dad, you want me to leave?

621
00:44:52.273 --> 00:44:53.316
No.

622
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:56.068
Dear, we just want
what's best for you.

623
00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:58.029
But Stuart lives here.

624
00:44:58.237 --> 00:45:00.615
George, come on.
This is hard for all of us.

625
00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:02.158
This stinks!

626
00:45:08.623 --> 00:45:09.999
I don't understand.

627
00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:12.126
I thought I was in a fairy tale.

628
00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:14.629
Fairy tales are made-up stories.

629
00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:17.757
This is real.
This is about where you belong.

630
00:45:18.007 --> 00:45:21.427
Please come home, Stuart.
Your real home.

631
00:45:21.677 --> 00:45:24.847
You're gonna love it, son.
We live on a golf course!

632
00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:27.934
-We look right over the fairway!
-It's beautiful.

633
00:45:28.226 --> 00:45:29.644
Beautiful.

634
00:45:33.147 --> 00:45:34.649
Taxi!

635
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.611
What's a mouse have to do
to get a cab in this city?

636
00:45:47.787 --> 00:45:49.746
Will you speak to George for me?

637
00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:53.167
I'd hate to say goodbye
to a basement door.

638
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:56.254
Of course.

639
00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:57.754
Taxi!

640
00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:00.549
Yo, taxi!

641
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:04.303
Time to go, Stuart!

642
00:46:10.685 --> 00:46:11.978
Goodbye.

643
00:46:21.112 --> 00:46:22.571
We love you.

644
00:46:25.825 --> 00:46:27.784
I love you too, Mom.

645
00:46:29.412 --> 00:46:30.705
Mrs. Little.

646
00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:07.824
Boy, that looks heavy.
You need help with that?

647
00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:09.201
Camille?

648
00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.914
Frederick, let's do something.

649
00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:15.166
What?

650
00:47:15.374 --> 00:47:18.961
Let's just make them go away.
We're bigger than they are.

651
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.131
We'll say, "Go. Shoo."
We'll scare their whiskers off.

652
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.300
Eleanor, you're not being rational.

653
00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:25.634
Rational, shmational.

654
00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:28.888
Something about this is not right.
I just know it.

655
00:47:29.138 --> 00:47:32.058
Look at them. They just fit.

656
00:47:32.266 --> 00:47:35.811
So? I have shoes that fit
and I hate them! As Stuart's mother--

657
00:47:36.062 --> 00:47:37.480
But you're not.

658
00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:39.982
She is.

659
00:47:46.906 --> 00:47:48.199
Wait!

660
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.832
I want you to have this.

661
00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:02.713
Not the roadster, George.
You love this car. I couldn't.

662
00:48:02.922 --> 00:48:04.256
I want you to.

663
00:48:05.424 --> 00:48:06.592
Thanks, George.

664
00:48:06.842 --> 00:48:08.719
I wish you didn't have to go.

665
00:48:08.928 --> 00:48:10.721
I'm gonna miss you.

666
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.848
I'll miss you too, George.

667
00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:40.686
Sing with me, Stuie!

668
00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:53.449
Tell me your favorite foods
so I can fix them for you.

669
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:55.284
What for? You can't cook.

670
00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:57.786
But I can learn. We're a family now.

671
00:49:57.994 --> 00:50:02.124
And there's adjustments
we'll have to make. Right, Reggie?

672
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:03.834
Right, Camille.

673
00:50:05.294 --> 00:50:07.421
Here we are, Stuie, the family home.

674
00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.298
The family home.

675
00:50:09.507 --> 00:50:11.342
This is just our summer place.

676
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:15.554
Winter, we live above
a delicatessen. You like corned beef?

677
00:50:15.804 --> 00:50:17.515
-How's it prepared?
-Prepared?

678
00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:20.851
It drops out of a fat guy's mouth,
we grab it and run.

679
00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:26.148
-Sounds like an acquired taste.
-Acquired taste? I love this kid!

680
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.359
Your new bedroom, Stuart.

681
00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:30.194
We hope you like it.

682
00:50:32.571 --> 00:50:36.075
Well, good night. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

683
00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:42.540
I'm serious about those bedbugs.
Keep an eye open.

684
00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:32.798
It's kind of you
to check on us like this.

685
00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:36.302
Actually, I had something to tell you.

686
00:51:36.885 --> 00:51:40.306
But first, how are things going?

687
00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:43.099
-It's been difficult.
-Difficult?

688
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:44.727
No, very difficult.

689
00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:47.103
-Very difficult?
-Worse.

690
00:51:47.313 --> 00:51:48.647
Worse than very difficult?

691
00:51:50.149 --> 00:51:52.443
-Yes, it's been almost--
-Unbearable.

692
00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:54.570
Just the word I was looking for.

693
00:51:55.654 --> 00:51:57.615
Maybe this isn't a good time then.

694
00:51:57.948 --> 00:52:00.618
You see, I came over
to give you some news.

695
00:52:00.826 --> 00:52:01.827
What type of news?

696
00:52:04.038 --> 00:52:06.122
-They had an accident.
-Who?

697
00:52:06.332 --> 00:52:07.499
Stuart's parents.

698
00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:11.086
My goodness.
Well, are they all right?

699
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:14.089
No. They didn't make it.

700
00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:16.091
Oh, no. Oh, my!

701
00:52:16.342 --> 00:52:18.344
-What happened?
-Well, apparently...

702
00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:21.639
...they were grocery shopping,
canned-food aisle.

703
00:52:21.847 --> 00:52:24.975
There was an unsteady pyramid
of cans and it collapsed.

704
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:27.186
Took three bag boys to dig them out.

705
00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:29.938
They identified them
by their dental records.

706
00:52:30.439 --> 00:52:32.191
Oh, how horrible!

707
00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:35.861
Cream of mushroom soup.
Two-for-one sale.

708
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:38.113
That's a very heavy soup.

709
00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:40.156
How is Stuart taking it?

710
00:52:40.366 --> 00:52:41.700
Well, he doesn't know.

711
00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:43.702
No one's told him?

712
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.871
Does he have to know?

713
00:52:46.288 --> 00:52:49.667
Six months after,
won't he wonder where they went?

714
00:52:49.875 --> 00:52:52.086
But they've been gone for years.

715
00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:55.130
Years? How is that possible?

716
00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:58.884
Because they died years ago.
Which part is confusing you?

717
00:52:59.134 --> 00:53:01.512
Stuart's parents took him away
three days ago.

718
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.971
Three days ago?

719
00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:04.390
Stuart's parents died...

720
00:53:04.598 --> 00:53:07.518
...in a tragic cream-mushroom-soup
incident years ago.

721
00:53:07.726 --> 00:53:08.894
I just told you.

722
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.564
We have to take this up
with the police.

723
00:53:24.743 --> 00:53:25.869
Mrs. Little?

724
00:53:26.078 --> 00:53:29.331
I'm Detective Sherman.
This is my partner, Detective Allen.

725
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.501
-We understand your son is missing.
-Thank you for coming.

726
00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:35.337
They know about the Stouts!

727
00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:38.924
-The jig is up! What will we do?
-Get ahold of yourself.

728
00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:42.094
I'm in big--!
I'm in deep poopy-do!

729
00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:45.055
Calm down.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.

730
00:53:45.264 --> 00:53:46.682
All we need is a new plan.

731
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.144
We do what we should've done
in the first place.

732
00:53:51.103 --> 00:53:53.021
-We scratch him out.
-Scratch him out?

733
00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:54.189
But, Smokey!

734
00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:57.067
The police are involved.
I don't wanna get kicked out.

735
00:53:57.276 --> 00:53:59.194
I'm not a street cat.
I'm a house cat.

736
00:53:59.403 --> 00:54:02.948
I don't wanna lose my furry basket
or my tinkle ball!

737
00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:05.159
Buddy, pull yourself together.

738
00:54:05.367 --> 00:54:06.702
It's settled.

739
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.456
Stuart Little gets scratched tonight.

740
00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:27.306
Okay. Very good.

741
00:54:27.723 --> 00:54:31.059
Mr. and Mrs. Little,
you'll have to come downtown.

742
00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:41.277
Detective Sherman, what are our
chances of seeing Stuart again?

743
00:54:42.404 --> 00:54:43.489
You want it straight?

744
00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:46.992
-No.
-Absolutely not.

745
00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:50.204
Well, in that case...

746
00:54:50.412 --> 00:54:53.289
...Stuart's probably home right now
waiting for you.

747
00:54:57.002 --> 00:55:00.005
Maybe we should hear it
a little straighter than that.

748
00:55:01.799 --> 00:55:03.258
In a case like this...

749
00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:06.512
...if the kidnappers
have not called by now...

750
00:55:06.762 --> 00:55:09.473
...then they're not
interested in money.

751
00:55:09.681 --> 00:55:11.683
-What are they interested in?
-Kicks.

752
00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:12.893
Exactly.

753
00:55:13.268 --> 00:55:15.229
It's my guess these two sickos...

754
00:55:15.437 --> 00:55:19.274
...are on some kind of cross-country
mouse-killing spree.

755
00:55:20.234 --> 00:55:21.735
Well, thank you.

756
00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.362
You can kiss him goodbye.

757
00:55:24.112 --> 00:55:25.113
Thank you.

758
00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:27.950
It's over. The things I've seen.

759
00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:31.161
Phil, where is that book
on the grisly photos?

760
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:34.039
Believe me,
you don't want to see this.

761
00:55:34.289 --> 00:55:35.874
It'll only take a second.

762
00:55:39.962 --> 00:55:42.381
Right off the bat.
Look at this one.

763
00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:44.466
This one kept me awake for weeks.

764
00:56:02.484 --> 00:56:03.861
What did they want?

765
00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:07.739
Where's the boy?

766
00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:09.700
Oh, no.

767
00:56:13.912 --> 00:56:15.581
Stuart, wake up.

768
00:56:16.331 --> 00:56:18.417
-Get dressed.
-Why?

769
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.919
-We're going for a ride.
-Where?

770
00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:23.213
Some friends of ours
want to meet you.

771
00:56:23.422 --> 00:56:26.091
A gathering? What should I wear?

772
00:56:26.341 --> 00:56:28.176
It doesn't matter. Wear anything.

773
00:56:28.427 --> 00:56:31.597
-Is it formal?
-Just put something on!

774
00:56:33.724 --> 00:56:35.434
Why is Mom crying?

775
00:56:36.894 --> 00:56:41.189
Mom? I'm not angry at you
for putting me up for adoption.

776
00:56:42.733 --> 00:56:47.029
And now that I'm a Stout again,
I'll always be here to take care of you.

777
00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:51.241
Because that's what families do.

778
00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:53.785
Mom, they take care of each other.

779
00:57:00.042 --> 00:57:01.710
Tell him the truth!

780
00:57:03.378 --> 00:57:05.130
You made a deal with a cat?

781
00:57:05.339 --> 00:57:07.633
He had us cornered
at the bottom of the cup.

782
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:08.926
It was curtains.

783
00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:12.095
So you agreed to pose
as my parents?

784
00:57:12.471 --> 00:57:14.222
You lied and cheated?

785
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:18.977
You took me away from the Littles
just when we were all so happy?

786
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:22.564
-Yes!
-That's wonderful.

787
00:57:23.148 --> 00:57:24.983
I think you missed something.

788
00:57:25.233 --> 00:57:29.154
That's why I've been feeling sad.
That's why I keep thinking of them!

789
00:57:29.404 --> 00:57:31.990
I'm not a Stout. I'm a Little!

790
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.659
I'm Stuart Little!

791
00:57:34.242 --> 00:57:37.955
I'm Stuart Little!

792
00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:42.125
Stuart, please.
You have to listen to us.

793
00:57:42.376 --> 00:57:45.253
The cats decided
you're too risky to keep around.

794
00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:47.297
They ordered us
to hand you over.

795
00:57:48.507 --> 00:57:51.009
As your fake father,
I order you to run.

796
00:57:51.343 --> 00:57:52.469
-I'll go home.
-Home?

797
00:57:52.678 --> 00:57:56.682
That's miles from here. And every cat
in the city is looking for you.

798
00:57:56.932 --> 00:57:58.767
Besides, you could get lost.

799
00:57:59.017 --> 00:58:00.978
No, I can't.

800
00:58:01.186 --> 00:58:03.939
Every Little in the world
can find the Little house.

801
00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:10.529
Bye, fake father!
Goodbye, fake mother!

802
00:58:10.779 --> 00:58:13.532
-Goodbye, fake son.
-Goodbye, Stuart.

803
00:58:14.992 --> 00:58:16.493
I'm gonna miss that boy.

804
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.870
I'm gonna miss that car.

805
00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:29.840
-Well, I think we have to--
-Tell him.

806
00:58:35.053 --> 00:58:38.140
-Who has the glue?
-I'm the glue man.

807
00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.059
What's going on?

808
00:58:41.268 --> 00:58:44.312
-We're making posters.
-We'll put them up all over the city.

809
00:58:44.563 --> 00:58:47.065
They describe Stuart
and offer a reward.

810
00:58:47.315 --> 00:58:48.400
Isn't it wonderful?

811
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:50.694
It was all George's idea.

812
00:58:59.453 --> 00:59:01.329
Never stop trying. Right, Dad?

813
00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:05.417
Listen, I'm afraid
this isn't gonna work.

814
00:59:05.667 --> 00:59:06.918
Why not?

815
00:59:09.087 --> 00:59:10.505
Frederick.

816
00:59:12.883 --> 00:59:16.219
Because there's no picture.
We need a picture of Stuart.

817
00:59:16.428 --> 00:59:17.763
The family photo.

818
00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:32.611
Smokey. Hey, Smokey!

819
00:59:32.861 --> 00:59:34.071
Keep it down.

820
00:59:34.279 --> 00:59:35.864
It's me, Lucky.

821
00:59:36.114 --> 00:59:39.743
I just heard from the Brooklyn cats.
Bad news. The Stouts squealed.

822
00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:41.578
I knew those mice were rats.

823
00:59:41.787 --> 00:59:43.914
The kid's on his way home.
What do we do?

824
00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:46.917
No problem. He's gotta go
through the park, right?

825
00:59:47.125 --> 00:59:49.294
Let's meet him
and have ourselves a picnic.

826
00:59:49.544 --> 00:59:51.379
Great. I'll bring herring.

827
00:59:51.588 --> 00:59:54.633
Moron! The mouse is the picnic.

828
01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:02.492
Every Little in the world
can find the Little house.

829
01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:05.662
I'm a Little. I'm a Little.

830
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.664
I'm a little lost.

831
01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:27.809
How you doing?

832
01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:29.477
You must be Stuart.

833
01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:34.482
-Actually, I must be going.
-What's your hurry, Murray?

834
01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:38.236
Yeah, where are you going, Murray--
Stuart? What's his name?

835
01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.199
Come back, you little rat!

836
01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:44.659
-He's getting away!
-Lucky, Red, get him!

837
01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:48.330
-He's going backwards!
-He's a hell of a driver!

838
01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.040
-Go, go, go, go!
-We got him!

839
01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.626
I got him, Smokey.
Yeah, I got him.

840
01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.379
The only thing that you guys got
are big mouths.

841
01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:57.923
So shut up and run!

842
01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:06.181
-Geronimo!
-Banzai!

843
01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.602
We got him now!

844
01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:19.277
-I got him! I got him!
-Get him, Red!

845
01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.665
I hope he runs out of gas!

846
01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:32.874
I hope you do.

847
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.960
-Run in the back.
-I can't help it.

848
01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:36.586
I have a nervous stomach.

849
01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:39.297
And I have an empty stomach!
Now get that mouse!

850
01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.646
Did you see that? Damn.

851
01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.815
Nobody could've survived that.

852
01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:59.192
Yeah, the mouse is sleeping
with the fishes.

853
01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.778
Long, wet nap.

854
01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.323
The sewer rat's alive! After him!

855
01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:08.034
No way. I'm a cat.
I don't do water.

856
01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.286
Red, you go.

857
01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:11.955
You want to do water,
hire a spaniel.

858
01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:16.334
I don't believe this. What are you
guys, a bunch of house cats?

859
01:03:29.097 --> 01:03:31.266
Oh, no! Oh, dear.

860
01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:32.809
Oh, dear.

861
01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:47.365
Crenshaw, Tina, Uncle Stretch,
you go uptown.

862
01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.534
Cover as many streets as you can.

863
01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:53.705
Edgar, Beatrice, Spencer,
you take downtown.

864
01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.999
Every side street and back alley.

865
01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.335
Estelle.

866
01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:02.672
You better go with them.

867
01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.175
Where do I go?

868
01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.218
You come with us.
We'll circle the park.

869
01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:30.575
I made it.

870
01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:34.287
I can't believe it. I'm home.

871
01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:37.832
Mom! Dad! I'm coming!

872
01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:57.102
It's me, Stuart! I'm back!

873
01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:05.443
Where is everybody?

874
01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.237
There's nobody else here.

875
01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.115
It's just you and me, kid.

876
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.741
Where'd they go?

877
01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:14.119
Movies, I think.

878
01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:15.787
Movies?

879
01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.832
Since you left,
it's just movies, parties...

880
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.584
...roller-skating, amusement parks.

881
01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:24.421
They're having the time
of their lives.

882
01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:26.631
-They are?
-Oh, sure.

883
01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:31.845
I hate to have to tell you this,
but they're celebrating.

884
01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:33.721
Celebrating what?

885
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.558
-Can't you guess?
-No.

886
01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:39.394
They were just so happy
to get rid of you.

887
01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:43.273
That's a lie! I don't believe that.

888
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.983
Oh, boy.

889
01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:49.571
I wish I could spare you this.
This is gonna break your heart.

890
01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.114
Look up there.

891
01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:52.949
At what?

892
01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:57.162
See for yourself.

893
01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:23.188
They did that right after you left.

894
01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.983
Mrs. Little said, "Who wants
to look at that face anymore?"

895
01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:29.027
-She did?
-Yeah.

896
01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:33.281
-And George?
-She gave it to him, and he tore it up.

897
01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:35.200
-He did?
-Yeah.

898
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:38.786
I'd give you the pieces,
but Mr. Little set them on fire.

899
01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:43.666
I tried to warn you, Stuart.
I told you it wasn't gonna work out.

900
01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.627
I should've known.

901
01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.046
It was too good to be true.

902
01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.215
What're you gonna do now?

903
01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.342
I don't know. I guess I'll--

904
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.511
Leave immediately? Good idea.

905
01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:59.390
I'll tell the family you dropped by,
although it'll probably make them sick.

906
01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:18.076
Bye, Snowbell.

907
01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.703
Goodbye, buddy.

908
01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:24.207
This is killing me.

909
01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:29.254
But I'm almost done.

910
01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:31.673
It's getting late. Time to go home.

911
01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:33.758
I didn't miss a single tree.

912
01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:35.218
You did a great job.

913
01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.763
-It was a good idea, wasn't it?
-You bet it was.

914
01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:41.224
It's a really good picture of Stuart.

915
01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:44.602
I don't think you could take
a bad picture of Stuart.

916
01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:46.396
Now all we have to do...

917
01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:51.025
...is wait until somebody calls
and tells us where Stuart is.

918
01:07:51.442 --> 01:07:52.694
Right.

919
01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:47.832
If we don't find Stuart,
it's gonna break his heart.

920
01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:56.132
Hey, Snow! A guy spotted Stuart.
Smokey sent me to get you.

921
01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:59.469
Gee, Monty, I'm in for the night.
It's late.

922
01:08:59.677 --> 01:09:02.805
Besides, Stuart is gone.
Can't we give the kid a break?

923
01:09:03.056 --> 01:09:04.390
We could give him a break.

924
01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:08.645
First we'll break his arms, then his
legs, and then we'll take a break.

925
01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:11.356
First we gotta find him.
Come on, we gotta run!

926
01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:14.567
Why do we have to run?
What is it, festival seating?

927
01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:20.156
Come on! I think we're getting closer.
I can smell him.

928
01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:21.866
Sorry, Smokey, that was me.

929
01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:25.078
Didn't your mothers warn you not
to go into Central Park at night?

930
01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:28.331
My mother was the reason you didn't
go into Central Park at night.

931
01:09:28.539 --> 01:09:30.166
Yeah, you tell them, Smokey.

932
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:33.836
She was one tough broad.
She was a saint.

933
01:09:35.213 --> 01:09:38.091
Quick question. Who knows CPR?

934
01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:41.135
Mouse prints are going everywhere.

935
01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:43.096
-How will we find him?
-We'll split up...

936
01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:46.099
-...and go in different directions.
-What a brain.

937
01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.476
That is why he is
gatto di tutti i gatti.

938
01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.521
You guys go ahead.

939
01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.731
I'll just collapse right here.

940
01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:10.915
Stuart, is that you?
What are you doing up there?

941
01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:13.209
I'm settling in.

942
01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.420
You got to get out of here.

943
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.130
This is Central Park. It's dark.

944
01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.090
There are hungry cats all over.

945
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.426
-Where are you?
-It's your pal, Monty.

946
01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.052
What's he doing here?

947
01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:25.596
-He'll hear you.
-Why shouldn't he hear me?

948
01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:30.268
Snowbell! Buddy!
What're you doing up there?

949
01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:33.062
Oh, no. Perfect.

950
01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:38.443
You found him. Attaboy!
Hey, everybody!

951
01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.111
Over here! Hey, guys!

952
01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.196
Snow found him!

953
01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:43.948
Nice going, house cat.

954
01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:47.577
Just for that, when we carve up
the mouse, you'll get the big half.

955
01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:51.038
Big half? Snowbell,
what's he talking about?

956
01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:53.291
Do you know those cats?

957
01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:55.585
Not really. We went
to a few parties, but....

958
01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:57.086
What's the matter?

959
01:10:57.295 --> 01:11:00.965
-What are you waiting for?
-Bring him down! I'm starving!

960
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:06.763
Sorry, kid.

961
01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:08.431
Wait, no! Stop!

962
01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:09.932
Put me down!

963
01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:13.561
Hit me! I'm open!
I'll break his fall with my mouth!

964
01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.438
I guess you do know them.

965
01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:17.940
Let him go! I can almost taste him!

966
01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:19.942
What are you waiting for?

967
01:11:20.318 --> 01:11:21.611
Where are you going?

968
01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:23.613
He's hogging the mouse.

969
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.782
-Get him!
-He's getting away!

970
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.658
-Let's get him!
-Go! Go!

971
01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:31.287
Snowbell. Watch it.
Where are you going?

972
01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:32.955
Hold that branch for me.

973
01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.791
Get out of my face.

974
01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:36.167
Get him!

975
01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.508
You saved me?

976
01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:48.596
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm doing this for the Littles.

977
01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.765
They love you. George loves you.

978
01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.476
They're all miserable without you.

979
01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.812
But, Snowbell, you said--

980
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.522
I know what I said.

981
01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:01.651
I lied, okay? Welcome to Manhattan.

982
01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.653
I'm the one that hates you.

983
01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:08.366
You do care.

984
01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:16.374
Yeah, okay. That's enough.

985
01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.334
Snow, what's he doing to your leg?

986
01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.547
I can't help but think this is wrong.

987
01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:24.173
What the hell's going on?

988
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:28.970
Look, Smokey, call me fickle, but...

989
01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.806
...I want to call
this whole thing off, okay?

990
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:33.724
Too late.

991
01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:37.562
Come on, Smokey.
Can't we talk it over?

992
01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:39.897
Stuart's not so bad
once you get to know him.

993
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.816
And he's got his own car.

994
01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.360
Careful, house cat.
You're asking for it.

995
01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:47.822
Snow, what are you doing? Come on!
He's just a mouse.

996
01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.700
He's not "just a mouse." He's....

997
01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:54.036
He's....

998
01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:56.414
He's family.

999
01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:00.376
I could see the resemblance.

1000
01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:05.339
Is that what you think?
You have to look alike to be family?

1001
01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.719
You don't have to look alike.

1002
01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:12.346
You don't have to like each other.
Look at him.

1003
01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:16.517
He hates me. And still,
he's trying to save me.

1004
01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:19.729
Sure, you'll probably
scratch him up pretty bad.

1005
01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:23.065
You may even kill him,
but Snowbell will not run away.

1006
01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:26.903
And that is what family is all about.

1007
01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:28.321
Right?

1008
01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:33.409
Maybe "family" is too strong a word.

1009
01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.453
-Scratch them both.
-Both?

1010
01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.541
It's me you want! Come and get me!

1011
01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:42.543
Here we go!

1012
01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:47.340
Get him!

1013
01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:51.218
Out of my way!

1014
01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.556
Get him! He's getting away!

1015
01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:08.653
Did he fall in the water?

1016
01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:10.154
I saw something hit.

1017
01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:13.491
Man, did you see that?
Gone. He just disappeared.

1018
01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:15.117
There he is!

1019
01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:17.828
Up there!

1020
01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.789
He's too far. I can't reach him.

1021
01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:24.752
In that case, you can all go home.
Prowl safely.

1022
01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.589
Here you go, boys. Dinner's served.

1023
01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.299
All right. Way to go!

1024
01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:31.801
Oh, dear.

1025
01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:34.595
It's mouse on a stick.
I love mouse on a stick.

1026
01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:39.684
A little further.
Keep him coming. Keep him coming.

1027
01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:41.185
I can almost reach him.

1028
01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.770
Keep it coming.

1029
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.397
I got him. He's mine.

1030
01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:51.362
The branch is gonna....

1031
01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:53.698
Well, what have we got here?

1032
01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.200
Don't come out here!
The branch is breaking!

1033
01:14:57.702 --> 01:15:00.830
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1034
01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:02.957
Hang on. I'll take it from here.

1035
01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.667
Take what?

1036
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.965
Come on, Snow.
You wouldn't do this to me.

1037
01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:13.884
Not your old buddy.

1038
01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:17.555
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm sure you'll...

1039
01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:20.516
-...land on your...
-What are you doing?

1040
01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:24.228
-Wait! I gotta ask you something!
-...feet!

1041
01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.235
Cold! Cold! Cold water!

1042
01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:32.945
I can't swim.

1043
01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:35.948
-Dog paddle!
-I'd rather drown.

1044
01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:38.242
And I had my fur
just the way I like it.

1045
01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:41.245
I'll be licking myself for days.

1046
01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:47.084
How could he do this to me,
after all we've meant to each other?

1047
01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:51.922
I mean, I love that guy!

1048
01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:54.717
Hey, you guys! Wait up for me!

1049
01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.344
Pack up the pineapple, Stuart!

1050
01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:58.846
This luau's over.

1051
01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:01.557
Thanks, Snowbell. You were great.

1052
01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:04.351
It must've been quite a show
from up there.

1053
01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.231
Those cats think they're so tough.

1054
01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:11.609
I guess I showed them.

1055
01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:14.111
Not bad for a house cat!

1056
01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.363
Not bad for a dead house cat.

1057
01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:23.788
Say good night, Tinkerbell.

1058
01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:31.253
His name is Snowbell!

1059
01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:45.309
Oh, this water's damn cold.
I can't believe this!

1060
01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:51.148
Beaten by a mouse and his pet cat.
What could be worse?

1061
01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:53.567
Nice doggy! No! No!

1062
01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:57.571
Little high, Little low.

1063
01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.907
Little hey, Little ho.

1064
01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:03.786
Let's go home.

1065
01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:09.542
You know, Snow,
I don't know how to thank you.

1066
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.628
How about not kicking me?
I'm beginning to bruise.

1067
01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:16.966
Sorry. I was getting excited. I've
never ridden a cat bareback before.

1068
01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:18.634
Well, don't get used to it.

1069
01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:20.594
Hold on, cowboy.

1070
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:32.189
-Thanks for the ride.
-Don't mention it. Ever.

1071
01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.587
Mom! Dad!

1072
01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:56.005
George!

1073
01:17:57.047 --> 01:18:00.092
It's me! Stuart! I'm back!

1074
01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:12.229
Mom! Dad! George!

1075
01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:14.106
I missed you all so much!

1076
01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:15.858
I thought I'd never see you again!

1077
01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:17.985
I don't understand.
How did you manage it?

1078
01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:22.740
Every Little in the world can find
the Little house. And Snowbell.

1079
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:24.992
I just couldn't have done it
without him.

1080
01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:27.912
Really?

1081
01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:30.039
What's the matter?

1082
01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:32.208
I was just thinking.

1083
01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:33.709
What, dear?

1084
01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.128
That this is how people look....

1085
01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.839
At the end of a fairy tale.

1086
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:40.716
Yeah.

1087
01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:42.509
Exactly.
