00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:06.423
Hello, I'm Rob Minkoff,
director of <i>Stuart Little...</i>

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.134
and sitting with me is
Henry Andersen, who is the...

3
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:11.803
- Animation supervisor.
- Exactly.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.722
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.727
I suppose you're wondering
how <i>Stuart Little</i> made it to the screen.

6
00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.938
Well, of course,
it started with a book...

7
00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.607
written by the noted author
E.B. White...

8
00:00:23.774 --> 00:00:25.776
who also wrote <i>Charlotte's Web.</i>

9
00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:29.530
Which is a book, I think, most people,
or many people, are familiar with.

10
00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.491
He wrote <i>Stuart Little,</i>
actually, first...

11
00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.495
and it was written in 1945,
just after the war.

12
00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:40.332
Now, how it got made into a movie
is really, I guess...

13
00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.627
the question
that I'm going to answer.

14
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.508
Columbia Pictures had been developing
the project as a script for many years.

15
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.927
They'd gone through many writers...

16
00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:54.888
who'd written many drafts
of different stories of it.

17
00:00:55.055 --> 00:01:00.143
But it wasn't until Night Shyamalan
wrote a draft of the screenplay...

18
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.813
which articulated the story
of the feature film...

19
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.440
that we're seeing here...

20
00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.985
did they actually green-light
the picture...

21
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.237
and decide to go ahead
with production.

22
00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:11.905
And at that point...

23
00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:16.076
I was hired as the director
of the film.

24
00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.245
Of course, my background
was animation.

25
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:22.541
The last picture I had directed
was <i>The Lion King...</i>

26
00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:25.919
and in that picture, I was actually...
I worked as a co-director.

27
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:31.258
In this picture, I was, you know...
I'm credited as the director.

28
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:36.346
Although Henry here was a director
in many respects...

29
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:41.435
working with the animators on the
performance of the digital characters.

30
00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.729
We had assembled
a team of animators.

31
00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:49.192
Those animators worked collectively
as a group, almost like an actor.

32
00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:53.739
So in creating Stuart, we put together
our team of animators...

33
00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:57.409
and then, under Rob's direction,
we basically performed...

34
00:01:57.576 --> 00:01:59.995
like the other actors in the movie.

35
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:05.375
That's Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie,
who are playing Mr. and Mrs. Little.

36
00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.463
Very excited about adopting what
they think is gonna be a human child.

37
00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:13.550
What's the difference...

38
00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:16.637
between directing an animated film
and a live-action film?

39
00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:21.016
Of course, when you direct
an animated film...

40
00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:24.645
if you don't like the expression
on a character, you can erase...

41
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:26.730
which...

42
00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:31.276
It doesn't work with human actors,
because, you know, it's...

43
00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:34.446
Because you can't erase
their eyebrows, basically.

44
00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:37.407
You could try, I suppose,
but I don't think they'd like it.

45
00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.826
No, they probably wouldn't.

46
00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.704
You know what's wonderful?

47
00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:44.039
What's wonderful...

48
00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:47.751
And Stuart's voice, of course,
was provided by Michael J. Fox...

49
00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:50.754
who is a fantastic actor
with great comic timing.

50
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:53.799
Originally, the character was written
as a 9-year-old boy...

51
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.636
and we thought, you know, maybe
we should have a child play the part.

52
00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:00.430
I think even Jonathan Lipnicki
was considered...

53
00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:04.476
to do the voice of Stuart
before we cast him as George.

54
00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:08.897
But I think Michael really brought
the right quality...

55
00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:10.941
you know,
to express this character...

56
00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:14.194
who had to be kind of
worldly wise on the one hand...

57
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.405
but then innocent on the other...

58
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.283
without actually becoming, you know,
too maudlin or treacly.

59
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.747
So he really was able to bring
a great balance to the character...

60
00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.166
in giving him, you know,
kind of a warmth...

61
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.461
and a wit and a sense of humour
and mischievousness...

62
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:35.674
that really combined to create,
I think, you know, a rich personality.

63
00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:40.470
We were trying not only for a
ultra-realistic, very believable look...

64
00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:45.851
but we wanted his actions to be very
believable as well so the audience...

65
00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:49.104
By this point in the movie,
people have forgotten he's animated.

66
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.482
They're just starting to enjoy
his performance...

67
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.317
and think about his personality.

68
00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:58.238
And one of the things that we did
to help get started in the process...

69
00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.490
was hire an actor, Bill Irwin...

70
00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.744
who is a pantomimist and a clown.

71
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.165
And he came in, actually,
and both Henry and I worked with him...

72
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:13.128
and videotaped him going through
various scenes from the script...

73
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.714
so he was physicalising
a performance of Stuart...

74
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.759
to give a kind of a stepping-stone...

75
00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.095
to what would eventually be
Stuart's CGI performance.

76
00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.890
One of the great things about Bill too
is his, you know...

77
00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.684
Remember how he described it as like
eccentric dance?

78
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.186
His eccentric dance style.

79
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.188
And he did a little of that for us too.

80
00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:34.357
And even though Stuart doesn't do
much dancing in the film...

81
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:38.403
There's a certain way of being light
on his feet that Bill's so great at...

82
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.698
that, you know, we all studied it
as we were working on it.

83
00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:47.829
But animation in general is a very
choreographic, intensive art form.

84
00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.540
Because what you're trying to do
is convey attitude...

85
00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:54.419
and character and thought process
through the movement of the body.

86
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:58.548
And so, what an animator goes through
in order to design that movement...

87
00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.510
and to convey that feeling
and that attitude...

88
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.137
has to go through
what a dancer goes through...

89
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:08.600
in terms of using, really,
his body to express these ideas.

90
00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:13.063
Absolutely. And it's also the same,
to a degree, as a musician.

91
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.942
Because with a piece of animation
like Stuart...

92
00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.860
it's really about pose and timing.

93
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:22.280
So you've got a nice, strong pose,
set a certain frame...

94
00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.907
and it's very syncopated.

95
00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:28.203
Now, there are other ways that people
can actually do these kinds of things.

96
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.580
One of them is called motion capture.

97
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:35.252
And what that is,
is it's a fairly complex technology...

98
00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:38.797
where you attach, I guess,
these sensors...

99
00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:41.299
to an actor or a dancer's body...

100
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.637
which correspond to key points
on the digital character.

101
00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.639
And when the actor or dancer
moves...

102
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:51.935
the corresponding point
on the CG character...

103
00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.855
will move in a kind of a one-to-one
relationship.

104
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:58.942
And that's how some
of this work is done.

105
00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:02.529
But Stuart was handled in
a completely different process...

106
00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:05.031
where you can actually
create poses...

107
00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:08.785
much the same way that you would
do with a 3D animated picture...

108
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.830
you know, like
a Ray Harryhausen movie.

109
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:15.834
<i>King Kong</i> or, you know,
<i>Jason and the Argonauts.</i>

110
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:20.505
You know, all those pictures were done,
where the sculptures were moved...

111
00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:23.049
you know, one frame at a time
and photographed.

112
00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.428
And the difference
in the CG world is that...

113
00:06:26.595 --> 00:06:29.306
you can actually manipulate
and alter...

114
00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.766
once you've recorded
those basic moves.

115
00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:35.145
It gives you an opportunity to refine
the performance in a way...

116
00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.856
that a traditional, like,
clay approach...

117
00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:41.276
or traditional three-dimensional
approach wouldn't allow you to do.

118
00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.986
Now Stuart's home.

119
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:47.324
Exactly. He's checking out
some of his new relatives.

120
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.493
Including his brother, George,
played by Jonathan Lipnicki.

121
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.080
It's interesting because before
this movie, I actually got to...

122
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.666
We all became familiar
with Jonathan...

123
00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.919
from his work in the movie
<i>Jerry McGuire...</i>

124
00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:03.465
- in which he was just so adorable.
- So darn cute.

125
00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:05.675
And we decided,
based on that performance...

126
00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.011
that we really wanted him
to play George.

127
00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.013
We were concerned
he was too young...

128
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.183
because at the time we started
shooting, he was 7 years old.

129
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.685
And what that means is,
is you can only use him...

130
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:17.938
for four hours of the shooting day.

131
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:22.859
So it's very difficult to actually
film with a child actor...

132
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.737
because of the demands
that are placed on your schedule.

133
00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:28.615
He's just about to get
to meet up with Stuart here.

134
00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:31.534
This whole sequence,
the animators had a lot of fun doing...

135
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.119
because it's so emotional.

136
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.081
You know, Stuart's really excited
because he came home from...

137
00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.166
He's adopted,
he's home with the family.

138
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.168
But he starts to get a little confused.

139
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:44.047
And everybody had a great time
animating this.

140
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:48.385
Yeah, this is Sean Mullen's...
Did all this work, the digital...

141
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.762
All the drops
that flew off him before...

142
00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.140
there's effects throughout the movie.
Very subtle in most cases...

143
00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:57.352
but droplets of water,
different things with his clothing...

144
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:02.107
all different effects that, again,
try to get Stuart solidly in the movie.

145
00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.109
Or did he seem
a little disappointed?

146
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.237
Now, one of the things
you might notice is the design...

147
00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:11.282
of not only the house but costumes,
and of the actors, and the hairstyles.

148
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.704
And all these things were to evoke
a kind of period feel in the film.

149
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.165
Something that might have been
appropriate in the 1940s or '50s...

150
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.251
around the time
the book was written.

151
00:08:21.418 --> 00:08:24.713
And this was to really set the world
of this film apart...

152
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.464
from the world that we live in.

153
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.134
Because one of the things
that occurred to me...

154
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.469
when I started on the picture...

155
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:35.432
and one of the, you know,
sort of directions...

156
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.309
I wanted to take with the material,
was to make sure...

157
00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:42.105
that the world
that Stuart existed in...

158
00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:46.026
was a world that was recognisable
but different from our own.

159
00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.028
Because it seemed to me...

160
00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.905
if the film looked too much
like contemporary reality...

161
00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:56.286
something that was too recognisable
or too immediately recognisable...

162
00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:00.248
that it would be confusing
that the people didn't act disturbed...

163
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.625
that he's talking,
because he's a mouse.

164
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:03.877
Which is, you know...

165
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:07.380
if you actually had a mouse walk
into your house and start talking...

166
00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:10.884
I don't think you'd be treating him
quite the way the Littles do.

167
00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.803
- Or anyone else in the film.
- No, not at all.

168
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.981
This scene in which
Snowbell confronts Stuart...

169
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:27.692
was actually created later
in the process.

170
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:31.696
We'd shot the film and cut it together,
and decided that we needed a scene...

171
00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:35.116
to establish the comic relationship
between Snowbell and Stuart.

172
00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.243
So for this scene,
we hired two writers...

173
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.496
Scott Alexander
and Larry Karaszewski...

174
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:44.000
who had written <i>The People vs. Larry
Flynt, Ed Wood, Man on the Moon.</i>

175
00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.878
And they came in
and actually wrote this scene...

176
00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.714
one of the comic highlights,
I think, in the picture.

177
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:53.259
And certainly gets the comedy
of Snowbell off to a roaring start.

178
00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.845
And it allowed
Stuart and Snowbell to get closer.

179
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.932
Plus, Stuart got out of the bed.
In the other, he never got out.

180
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:02.685
And this shot coming up right now,
I'm so glad we got to do this.

181
00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.187
Love when he chases him back.

182
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.148
And you'll notice he trips
because his tail gets stretched.

183
00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.109
Snowbell actually steps on his tail...

184
00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:12.320
stretches it out,
and causes Stuart to fall.

185
00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:16.366
One of the things that's fun
about a project like this is...

186
00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:20.203
we're all so familiar with the conflict
between a cat and a mouse.

187
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.498
We've seen that, obviously, with
Tom and Jerry and other characters.

188
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.876
- Itchy and Scratchy come to mind.
- Natural antagonists.

189
00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.754
But I don't think
we've ever actually seen a real cat...

190
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:33.216
and somewhat of a real mouse...

191
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:36.761
having this kind of a fun,
you know, cartoon relationship.

192
00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.224
So this was actually...
The sequence coming up here...

193
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.394
with the bathroom
and everything, was...

194
00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:47.522
as we were talking about,
was one of the first things shot...

195
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:49.941
and one of the first
we started animation on.

196
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.611
These shots here of Stuart coming out
and then going in the bathroom...

197
00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:57.407
were some of the first shots
we did of Stuart. And...

198
00:10:57.574 --> 00:11:01.286
It was also some of the first scenes
we shot in the live action.

199
00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:04.122
What's interesting about this is,
you have to imagine...

200
00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.875
when we shot this originally,
there was no Stuart.

201
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:10.086
So everything was shot
as an empty frame.

202
00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:12.172
We had to imagine
Stuart's performance.

203
00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:15.466
So when he was walking up the ladder
or walking across the table...

204
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:19.262
you know, the cameramen had
to follow an imaginary Stuart...

205
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.598
because there was nothing there
to watch.

206
00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:25.059
We did have some little puppets
on the stage that we used...

207
00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:28.104
just to block out the action,
but then, as you're saying...

208
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:31.941
the actors had to sort of imagine him.
And remember the laser?

209
00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:33.318
Yes, that's right.

210
00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:35.486
- Love the dot?
- Love the dot. Exactly.

211
00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:40.158
That was the technique we used,
a laser pointer called Synchromark...

212
00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.785
that was slaved
to the camera shutter speed...

213
00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:47.081
so you could actually point the laser
and the actors would be able to see it...

214
00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.459
but the camera
wouldn't photograph it...

215
00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:53.671
because when the camera shutter
was open, the laser would be off.

216
00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.799
That was great to get everybody to look
in the right place.

217
00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:00.303
Because one of the most important
things that you have to deal with...

218
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.555
is the actors shooting the scene...

219
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.059
are not shooting, or not doing
the scene with a real character...

220
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.603
but they have to know
where to look...

221
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.315
because if their eyes aren't
directly focused at the character...

222
00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.442
it really destroys the illusion.

223
00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:21.074
Originally, Stuart was meant
to be trapped in the refrigerator...

224
00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:24.744
but we decided a washing machine
might be a bit more perilous...

225
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.872
obviously since it's going to be
filled with water.

226
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.209
That's odd.

227
00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.002
We knew we wanted a moment...

228
00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:37.131
for Snowbell to actually come in
and see Stuart in the washing machine.

229
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:40.843
Of course, the comic possibilities
were tremendous for this moment...

230
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.263
but we couldn't come up
with the right line...

231
00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:45.098
for Snowbell to say to Stuart...

232
00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:49.018
so we turned to Ed Stone,
who had written <i>Happy, Texas...</i>

233
00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:54.732
and he came in and in minutes
he came up with this brilliant line.

234
00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.318
Why would I turn it off?

235
00:12:57.568 --> 00:12:59.904
It's my favourite show.

236
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.033
Which was one of the funniest lines,
I think, in the movie.

237
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.661
- You can't leave me!
- Talk to the butt.

238
00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:08.204
Snowbell, where are you going?

239
00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.873
I've gotta stare at traffic,
yawn, lick myself.

240
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.625
Believe me, that could take hours.

241
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.377
There's a shot coming up here...

242
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:17.463
You know, when Geena's at the door,
right here...

243
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.049
she says Stuart's having
the time of his life.

244
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.218
This was one of the last shots
we did...

245
00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:25.555
because this one, right here,
wasn't...

246
00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:27.557
We just got the budget
so we could put it in.

247
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.767
And it's one of the
best shots in the movie.

248
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:32.729
It's so beautiful because
it was one of the last things...

249
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:37.734
and everybody was completely
working at full capacity.

250
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.738
And we had incredible effects
by Rob Bredow added to that shot.

251
00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:43.156
Stuart!

252
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.495
In the original script,
there was a line that Stuart said.

253
00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:53.249
You know, he screamed,
"Mom, I'm trapped in the Maytag!"

254
00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:56.502
We tried to get the licence to use
a Maytag washer but we couldn't.

255
00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:02.800
So we ended up using a Frigidaire,
which I think is very important.

256
00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:05.595
Except that we modified it...

257
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.347
because the glass...

258
00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.933
They have those new washing machines
which look like old washing machines.

259
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.354
We wanted that because you could see
Stuart through the window of it.

260
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.565
It's important to stage the scene
where Stuart can look out...

261
00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:21.235
and, you know, Ms. Little could
look in or Snowbell could look in.

262
00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:24.947
If it was a regular washing machine,
most machines are top-loading...

263
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:28.993
and how would you stage something
with a top-loading washing machine?

264
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.996
- You couldn't spill him onto the floor.
- Exactly.

265
00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:35.291
- So that last sequence had...
- Dabney Coleman.

266
00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:38.669
Yeah. And a couple of the few shots
that had puppets of Stuart.

267
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.382
- There aren't too many animatronics.
- Animatronics, by Patrick Tatopoulos.

268
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:46.386
Capital T. But, yeah, they weren't...

269
00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:48.846
We had hoped to do more
with animatronics...

270
00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:50.848
at the beginning of the project.

271
00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:55.144
One of the reasons is for,
you know, cost, because...

272
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:58.856
It's expensive to build an animatronic.
There are so many moving parts...

273
00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:02.735
and they all have to be machined
for the one usage.

274
00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.737
You know, if you can actually...

275
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:10.410
Every scene of the CGI Stuart
is so vastly expensive...

276
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:14.747
- the more animatronic shots you get...
- We're not that expensive, are we?

277
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.332
It's outrageously expensive.

278
00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:20.086
- And if I were you, I wouldn't pay it.
- That's right.

279
00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.879
- But look at what you get.
- Exactly.

280
00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:24.507
There's so much flexibility
with the CGI character.

281
00:15:24.674 --> 00:15:26.926
- That's the thing.
- The animatronic, ultimately...

282
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:30.721
And particularly one that's so small,
is you have all these tiny parts...

283
00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:33.057
and so they don't move
very gracefully.

284
00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:38.688
And so we tended to wanna stay
as kind of as far away as you could...

285
00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:41.858
or else you could pretty much tell
that it was an animatronic.

286
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.738
Stuart is a little embarrassed there
that he scurries about.

287
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.032
This is Taylor Negron...

288
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:53.619
who's a character actor
we hired to play the salesman.

289
00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.705
I mean, we only use one take...

290
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:59.250
but remember some of his takes?
They were absolutely hilarious.

291
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.587
- And here's Ben.
- Ben.

292
00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:06.382
I never asked you, did that name come
from anywhere particularly? Ben?

293
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:09.927
- It must have been a play on Ken.
- Yes, that makes sense.

294
00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:12.680
It was in Night's script.
I think he invented the idea.

295
00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:13.890
The Ben doll.

296
00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.893
It was very important
in the first draft, as I recall.

297
00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:19.729
- Might have been his Uncle Ben.
- That's right.

298
00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:22.106
- Gentle Ben.
- Gentle Ben.

299
00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.817
I think I have just the thing.

300
00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.280
There they are.

301
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:37.747
Speaking of Stuart's clothes,
one of the gags that we wanted to do...

302
00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:40.958
was to actually have Stuart appear
in various outfits.

303
00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:45.171
But it turned out
that to create an outfit in the CGI...

304
00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:48.508
you know, to create a digital outfit
for Stuart was like...

305
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:52.345
$100,000, per outfit.

306
00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:55.097
So we couldn't afford it.

307
00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:58.309
So instead we just showed them
on the Ben dolls.

308
00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:00.186
- Right.
- Is that a boring excuse?

309
00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:03.773
No, that's not a boring excuse,
it's a practical excuse.

310
00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.691
But, you know,
the cost has come down.

311
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.069
We've learned a lot doing the fabric.

312
00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.988
Since you brought up the clothes,
I wanted to say one thing.

313
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:14.116
And that it is, you know,
the team that worked on it...

314
00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:17.078
headed up by Jim Berney
and Mike Travers...

315
00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:18.871
they, you know, it's...

316
00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:21.374
We've seen clothing
on digital characters before...

317
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.085
but I don't think
with this degree of realism.

318
00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:26.087
And there's a lot of consideration...

319
00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:30.216
not only for the type of weave and
things like that, but for Stuart's scale.

320
00:17:30.383 --> 00:17:33.094
He's so small that
his clothing's gonna bend differently...

321
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.012
than if he was 6 feet tall.

322
00:17:35.179 --> 00:17:38.891
So these guys worked very hard
on trying to...

323
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:42.812
not only get the fabric to bend and
to have the right weave and things...

324
00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.691
but also to have a sense of the scale
we were trying to get in the animation.

325
00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:48.859
Now we have two
favourite little nephews.

326
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:51.946
Here's the introduction
of the Little family...

327
00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:56.033
which is, of course, an important
element of the story, thematically...

328
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.412
because the story really is about
how Stuart, who's a mouse...

329
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:03.249
is trying to find his place
in this human family.

330
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.667
Attention, everybody.

331
00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.878
And, really, when they meet him,
no one knows what to say.

332
00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:10.006
- Exactly.
- And Stuart, at this point...

333
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:13.509
I mean, again, as the animation
supervisor on the film...

334
00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:16.012
I had to sort of think like Stuart
quite a bit.

335
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:20.850
I mean, Rob's aware that I wrote
a pretty long bio of Stuart...

336
00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.518
before we started the film...

337
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:25.354
so that I could get an idea
of who this character was.

338
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:29.191
And it was based on the Stuart
character from the E.B. White book...

339
00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:32.236
as well as Night's script.

340
00:18:32.403 --> 00:18:35.531
And so you really have to be concerned
at all times...

341
00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:37.617
with doing the right thing
for Stuart.

342
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.870
What's he really like as a personality
and what is he thinking?

343
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:44.874
So when he meets the family here,
those first few scenes you saw...

344
00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:47.710
and throughout these scenes
as he's getting presents...

345
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:50.212
you feel the sense that Stuart...

346
00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:54.425
What I was thinking he was feeling is,
this elation at being adopted...

347
00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.136
but he too is not completely
immune...

348
00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.847
to the sense of awkwardness
that's going on there.

349
00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:02.767
So even with
what he's having to say...

350
00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.645
he's still a little bit
unsure of himself.

351
00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.689
And I think Michael's performance
helped that too. Rob?

352
00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:10.775
Oh, yeah, definitely.

353
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.653
You know, I have to also say...

354
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:16.822
we've credited the influence
that Bill Irwin had on us...

355
00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.241
and Buster Keaton also
was a big influence...

356
00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:23.329
but Michael too. Michael's voice
drives a lot of what the character does.

357
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:27.208
I mean, his pauses and his inflections,
and his feeling for the character.

358
00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:30.795
And he really was a great choice
of voice, I think, for this character...

359
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.880
because he has a sophistication...

360
00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:36.592
but at the same time,
he's youthful and energetic.

361
00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:39.095
I'm sure you thought about that
when you cast him.

362
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:43.432
Absolutely. One of
the most important things, I think...

363
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.434
is the voice of the character...

364
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:48.854
because the performance starts there
and you have to build on that.

365
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:50.523
If you don't find the voice...

366
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.150
one that's gonna inspire
a great performance...

367
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:55.069
in animation or in movement...

368
00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.780
you know, you really won't have
a complete character.

369
00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:00.366
When you think
of great performances in animation...

370
00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.619
I think you definitely...
The voice goes hand in hand with it.

371
00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:05.955
And in the case with Stuart, for me...

372
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.541
I felt like we definitely got a blend
of the two.

373
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:12.545
Sometimes with an animated character,
the voice will overpower it a bit...

374
00:20:12.712 --> 00:20:15.506
you might see that actor
every time you hear the voice...

375
00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:17.967
even though the character
is animated.

376
00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:20.928
But I think with this one,
Michael is just a good blend...

377
00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:25.683
because his voice is characterful
and, you know, expressive...

378
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.977
but at the same time,
it doesn't overpower.

379
00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:31.355
It sort of blends and
really becomes Stuart.

380
00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:32.565
Right.

381
00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.150
Yeah, what do you say, George?

382
00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:37.236
At first we weren't sure
whether we were gonna cast a child...

383
00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:40.740
because in the script,
he was described as a 9-year-old.

384
00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:44.160
We thought, well, if we actually got
a 9-year-old to play the part...

385
00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:47.830
would that be really appropriate
in terms of how to tell this story?

386
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.917
And my feeling was, is I wanted to...

387
00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.336
I wanted Stuart, actually, to feel,
in a sense...

388
00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:56.172
like an older brother to George.

389
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.048
Even though
he's physically smaller...

390
00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.676
I wanted the relationship to be
of an old...

391
00:21:00.843 --> 00:21:04.096
Of kind of a mentor,
you know, for George.

392
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:06.432
That George was the one
that needed guidance...

393
00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.768
and Stuart was able
to actually help him...

394
00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.728
by giving him good advice.

395
00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:13.773
This also was...
Just back with animation for a second.

396
00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:15.983
This was one of the first things
we did.

397
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.195
That's Todd Wilderman,
animated that shot.

398
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.322
These were some of the first shots
we did.

399
00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:25.201
And it's really interesting how Stuart
really changed his physicality.

400
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:28.204
Even though I actually thought
when we started this project...

401
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.372
because it was
a digital character...

402
00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:34.001
and that it was physically
three-dimensional sculptures...

403
00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:38.172
that you'd make in the computer,
he would look consistent, the same.

404
00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:42.468
That was one thing you always had to
worry about in traditional animation...

405
00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:45.888
was how the drawing was gonna look
because different artists...

406
00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:47.890
just physically draw differently...

407
00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:50.684
and it's difficult to make
the drawings look the same.

408
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:53.312
Well, with Stuart,
he'll have to look the same...

409
00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:55.439
because he's the same
in every shot.

410
00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:59.235
But it's amazing to me that,
depending on the animator...

411
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:04.156
- he'll take on a different appearance.
- The animation and also the lighting.

412
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.158
The lighting makes
a huge difference...

413
00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:10.204
because just like when
you're lighting an actor, it's...

414
00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:13.958
Stuart, you'll see throughout the movie,
even if he was just standing still...

415
00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:16.836
you would see a different mouse
in some lighting setups.

416
00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.629
Like, this one's kind of nice.

417
00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:22.967
Stuart actually looks the best to me
when he sort of gets a glancing light...

418
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:27.096
because it brings out his brows
and a lot of the structure in his face...

419
00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:31.475
that when he's lit a little more flatly,
disappears because he's all white.

420
00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:34.854
It's like trying to light a golf ball
and be able to see the dimples.

421
00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:38.399
If the light doesn't hit at an angle,
it's really difficult to see.

422
00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:40.818
I think in some of the scenes...

423
00:22:40.985 --> 00:22:44.154
he's a bit flat because
we were having to match lighting...

424
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:46.448
that was coming from
all over the place.

425
00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:50.744
The ones where it's kind of source light
coming from one side or the other...

426
00:22:50.911 --> 00:22:55.124
where there's a stronger source light,
he really looks great.

427
00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:58.127
And those shots we saw there
with the empty space sequence...

428
00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.629
those were some of the first
close-ups we did.

429
00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:04.300
I don't know if you remember that, Rob.
When he was looking over the knees?

430
00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:07.970
I'm so used to seeing this
with the fur and everything...

431
00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:11.724
but it was just astounding to see
those shots a year and a half ago.

432
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:14.059
And to see those
first close-up expressions.

433
00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:18.147
I think, actually, Jason, the producer,
those were the shots he talked about...

434
00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:21.609
when he wasn't sure
how it was gonna actually look...

435
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:24.904
and then when he saw those,
he was sort of able to relax and say:

436
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.157
"Wow, you guys are gonna be able
to pull this off."

437
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:30.910
Now, this scene is a great example
of the work...

438
00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:33.245
that was done
by the animal trainers...

439
00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:36.874
whose job it was to train the cats
and get them to do a performance.

440
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:38.584
Because, just like Stuart...

441
00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:43.547
they had to appear to be thinking,
you know, talking characters.

442
00:23:43.714 --> 00:23:47.009
And when you think about what it takes
to get a cat to do this stuff...

443
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.594
it's mind boggling...

444
00:23:48.761 --> 00:23:53.015
because cats are almost
impossible to train.

445
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:56.060
And Boone Narr and his group...

446
00:23:57.853 --> 00:24:01.273
did just a marvellous job,
with this scene in particular.

447
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.695
But this was a case of actually creating
a lot of this choreography...

448
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:08.530
once we got into the kitchen.

449
00:24:08.697 --> 00:24:13.369
We had the set built and we discovered
using different levels of the kitchen...

450
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.579
actually helped define
the performance...

451
00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:20.167
so that all these moments between
the characters came across clearly.

452
00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:23.671
If you have cats just standing
and staring at each other, talking...

453
00:24:23.837 --> 00:24:25.673
really, nothing happens.

454
00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:29.301
And, you know,
there's no impression of life...

455
00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.887
which you could get
with live actors...

456
00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:35.265
you know, doing a performance,
but not with cats.

457
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:41.063
So all of this stuff, this movement,
you know, that was designed, really...

458
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:46.026
to try to convey the different
emotional beats, was really critical.

459
00:24:46.193 --> 00:24:50.072
And then it just takes so much
painstaking attention to detail...

460
00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:52.950
to get these cats to try
take after take...

461
00:24:53.117 --> 00:24:55.744
to get these cats to do
what you want them to do.

462
00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:57.746
You fool the cats into doing it...

463
00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:00.541
because, you know, you can't...
They won't...

464
00:25:00.708 --> 00:25:03.335
You can't just ask a cat
to do something.

465
00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:06.630
You have to, you know,
you have to guide it or trick it.

466
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:08.882
One of the techniques
that they had was...

467
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:11.301
Which was interesting,
was similar to the actors'.

468
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.430
We had was the laser pointer
for the cats to look at.

469
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:17.433
So that in a scene,
some of these scenes...

470
00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:20.352
they would shine a light
on the door or on the floor...

471
00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:23.230
and get the cats to look at it and stop
and react to it.

472
00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:25.357
Other times
they would have a light wand...

473
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.943
they turn on
and get the cat to pay attention.

474
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.530
So here, like, the cat has to go
from looking one direction to another.

475
00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:34.825
It requires two trainers, generally,
to get the cat's performance...

476
00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:36.785
or get them to look back and forth.

477
00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:40.873
But all of these moments
which are expressing this kind of...

478
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.292
vital personality...

479
00:25:43.459 --> 00:25:46.754
it's amazing even to me...

480
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.256
even though I've seen it
every step of the way.

481
00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:53.010
When you look at it all together
and when the cutting is finished...

482
00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:56.805
and when all the bits and pieces
that you find are all put together...

483
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:59.516
and you believe these cats
are thinking and talking.

484
00:26:00.017 --> 00:26:02.603
And he is talking to this mouse
that wasn't there.

485
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.063
That's right. It's amazing.

486
00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:07.483
And I think we also should give
some credit to Tom...

487
00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:09.818
Tom Finan, the editor.
He did a fantastic job.

488
00:26:09.985 --> 00:26:12.196
Yeah, because he had to
sift through...

489
00:26:12.362 --> 00:26:16.283
however many tens of thousands
of feet to try to find things.

490
00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.495
Because, as you were saying,
the movements of the cats...

491
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:23.499
to get them to synch up with dialogue
so it looked like they were acting...

492
00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:26.293
Tom had to go through
thousands of feet...

493
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.923
and try to get bits of action that
had been shot, that would line up.

494
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.134
Because the guys at Rhythm & Hues
doing the facial animation...

495
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:37.846
one of the frustrations for them is
they can't move the whole head...

496
00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:39.848
and they can't move the torso...

497
00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:42.893
to get the acting
into the reading of dialogue.

498
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.187
So they really relied
on Tom's choices.

499
00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:47.523
- And Centropolis'.
- And Centropolis, yes.

500
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:49.191
Centropolis and Rhythm & Hues.

501
00:26:59.201 --> 00:27:02.746
No mice were injured in the production
of this motion picture.

502
00:27:03.247 --> 00:27:07.292
The other thing that you might notice
is that some of the cats are different.

503
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:10.254
In this shot this is Rocky,
the crazy cat...

504
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.048
who would go running, you know,
at the drop of a pin.

505
00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:14.383
There are other cats.

506
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.719
Prince was the star cat,
who did all of the close-up work...

507
00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:20.389
where we had to get close
and see his expressions...

508
00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:24.893
because he just actually had
a more intense gaze and stare.

509
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.813
So throughout the film,
there were several different cats...

510
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.731
playing each one of the roles.

511
00:27:33.152 --> 00:27:35.404
Interesting how they had
different motivations.

512
00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:37.239
- Like, Prince was so calm.
- Yeah.

513
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:41.743
He was very calm. He'd just sit there
for 15, 20 minutes if asked to.

514
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.329
And so now Stuart's fallen
into the basement.

515
00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:47.291
He's met up with George again,
his old pal.

516
00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:50.836
This was actually the very last scene
that we shot...

517
00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:53.130
in principal photography.

518
00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.591
This was something we all dreaded.

519
00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:57.926
We didn't wanna go to the basement.

520
00:27:58.135 --> 00:28:01.096
- It was dark down there.
- It was really, really complicated.

521
00:28:01.263 --> 00:28:04.433
It was probably the most complicated
thing to shoot...

522
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.269
because Jonathan,
who is 7 years old...

523
00:28:07.436 --> 00:28:11.356
had to play this whole scene
with so many dramatic turns in it...

524
00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:14.443
with a mouse
who wasn't ever there.

525
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.739
And, you know, just the demands
that we had to place on him...

526
00:28:18.906 --> 00:28:21.742
were so incredible that we all...

527
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:24.620
were just worried,
not only for him but for ourselves...

528
00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:29.041
about how long or how difficult
it would be to get some of these shots.

529
00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:32.127
Stuart was very concerned
about having to do this shot.

530
00:28:32.294 --> 00:28:34.296
- Absolutely.
- He was afraid of that train.

531
00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:37.674
But you know what?
Stuart does all his own stunts.

532
00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:40.928
Except those that Delio Tramontozzi
animated for him.

533
00:28:41.094 --> 00:28:44.806
I have to say we had one animator
who did most of the shots...

534
00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:49.186
where you'd say Stuart was doing
something death-defying, like climbing.

535
00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:51.438
- And he did them all?
- He did all of them.

536
00:28:51.605 --> 00:28:54.483
He sort of became
Stuart's stunt double.

537
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.319
See now, this is Stuart's car.

538
00:28:57.486 --> 00:28:59.821
It's actually George's car
but it becomes Stuart's.

539
00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:03.533
But this was based on a scene
from the book...

540
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.204
in which Stuart visits the dentist,
I believe.

541
00:29:07.371 --> 00:29:09.331
- Is it the dentist?
- Yeah. The dentist.

542
00:29:09.498 --> 00:29:14.503
- The dentist has a little car like this.
- That car could become invisible.

543
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:18.173
The one difference between that car
and this car it could become invisible.

544
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.844
But we really were inspired by the idea
of Stuart being able to travel...

545
00:29:23.053 --> 00:29:26.390
in these different, like,
you know, miniature things.

546
00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:28.558
Not only the car but the <i>Wasp.</i>

547
00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:31.311
At one time, early in the development
of the project...

548
00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:35.023
we were contemplating the idea
of a toy airplane.

549
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.027
Of a kind of remote-controlled plane
that Stuart would fly over Manhattan.

550
00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:41.863
That was something
that we had wanted to do...

551
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.033
and, ultimately,
we abandoned that idea.

552
00:29:45.242 --> 00:29:48.245
You know, with each of the animators,
there was a...

553
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:52.666
I sort of worked with Rob. We'd cut
the movie, I'd look at the shots...

554
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:57.963
and then I would cast the animators,
depending on which animator...

555
00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.716
I thought had the right sensibilities
for that shot.

556
00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:03.885
A lot of stuff we just went through
was done by Pepe Valencia...

557
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:07.431
and had to be done
very, very carefully...

558
00:30:07.597 --> 00:30:12.728
very subtle, very, very subdued.
The acting in a lot of this...

559
00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:15.605
This one's very nice too.
This is Kelvin Lee's shot.

560
00:30:15.772 --> 00:30:17.232
And this next one coming up...

561
00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:22.654
can kind of go from being subdued
to being a little more enthusiastic.

562
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.531
What do you say?

563
00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:27.409
Let's get started.

564
00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:30.162
You know...

565
00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:32.414
I'm not really sure I want a brother.

566
00:30:34.916 --> 00:30:36.251
Well, how about a friend?

567
00:30:37.461 --> 00:30:40.589
I guess I could always use a friend.

568
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:43.592
- George?
- Yes, Dad?

569
00:30:43.759 --> 00:30:45.093
Have you seen Stuart?

570
00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.262
He's down here with me.

571
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:48.805
What are you doing to him?

572
00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:51.641
This scene was Hugh Laurie's
very last scene.

573
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.895
Just after we shot this scene,
he went back to London.

574
00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:58.565
That was actually an interesting thing.
Hugh Laurie is a British actor.

575
00:30:58.732 --> 00:31:00.692
And although he was playing
an American...

576
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:03.236
he had to adopt an American accent
to do it.

577
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:04.988
And in our first audition...

578
00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:07.449
I actually held the audition
over the telephone...

579
00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:10.535
because he was in London
and I was in the United States.

580
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:14.915
And I needed to hear what
his American accent would be like...

581
00:31:15.082 --> 00:31:18.210
to know that it was gonna work
for the film.

582
00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:22.672
And it was something that he,
you know, focused himself on...

583
00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:27.511
and he did a remarkable,
remarkable job...

584
00:31:28.136 --> 00:31:29.846
nailing an American accent...

585
00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:32.974
which is not easy at all.
It's very difficult.

586
00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:36.895
A lot of British actors try to do it,
some more successful than others.

587
00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:39.022
But Hugh did a tremendous,
tremendous job.

588
00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:41.983
And then later on
when he came back in...

589
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.611
once the film was shot
and was finished...

590
00:31:44.778 --> 00:31:46.738
he had to come in to do
some loop lines.

591
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.658
And we set up a telephone session.

592
00:31:49.825 --> 00:31:54.121
It was an ISDN session where
he was in London and I was here...

593
00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.498
and we were going through
the ADR. loops...

594
00:31:56.665 --> 00:32:00.001
and because he was in London...

595
00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:03.380
he had a whole crew of British people
surrounding him...

596
00:32:03.547 --> 00:32:08.677
and his accent was just not as good
as what he did in production.

597
00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:12.722
Ultimately he flew to New York where
we went through the session again.

598
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:16.101
And in those circumstances,
in that environment...

599
00:32:16.268 --> 00:32:19.062
it made it easier for him to focus
and concentrate...

600
00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:22.190
so that he could recapture
something...

601
00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:26.611
that he had actually done
almost a year before.

602
00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:29.114
So that was quite a challenge.

603
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:32.367
And one of the compliments paid
to his performance was...

604
00:32:32.534 --> 00:32:35.245
that someone was sitting in dailies
one day and said:

605
00:32:35.412 --> 00:32:38.790
"Gee, I thought he was British."
I said, "Well, he is British."

606
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:42.377
And they were amazed he did
such a credible American accent.

607
00:32:45.464 --> 00:32:48.592
That's a beautiful painting.
You're, like, right there.

608
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.054
Pork chop lake.

609
00:32:54.723 --> 00:32:56.558
If you're listening
to the audio track...

610
00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:59.936
I guess you won't be listening to us.
But if you switch over...

611
00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:02.397
you'll be hearing Stan Freberg...

612
00:33:02.564 --> 00:33:05.066
who's doing the announcer
for the boat race.

613
00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:08.445
And Stan Freberg is famous
for doing many, many...

614
00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:12.407
Not only his own radio shows
and records...

615
00:33:12.574 --> 00:33:15.827
kind of and comedy records.
He's the original "Weird AI" Yankovic.

616
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:19.706
But he did a lot of cartoon voices.
He did Pete Puma.

617
00:33:19.873 --> 00:33:22.417
He did the beaver
from <i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

618
00:33:22.584 --> 00:33:25.754
He did the baby from
the three bears cartoons.

619
00:33:25.921 --> 00:33:29.132
One of my favourite series of cartoons
from Chuck Jones.

620
00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:31.134
He was doing that
the night we recorded.

621
00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:34.804
He can still do that voice very well.
It was pretty funny.

622
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.558
But to be on the safe side,
I better check the hull for leaks.

623
00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:40.602
Whoop, there goes Stuart.

624
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:42.354
Down the hatch.

625
00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:45.941
Now this scene also was shot
indoors, on Stage 30.

626
00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:48.235
And what we had to do was convert...

627
00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:52.781
what was originally built
as Esther Williams' swimming pool...

628
00:33:52.948 --> 00:33:57.035
and we turned it into the boat pond
in Central Park.

629
00:33:57.202 --> 00:34:00.121
But all of these shots were done
indoors on that sound stage...

630
00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:03.166
which made it very difficult
to light properly...

631
00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:06.795
so that it would look
believably outdoors...

632
00:34:06.962 --> 00:34:08.630
even though it was shot indoors.

633
00:34:08.797 --> 00:34:14.761
So there were huge banks of lights
in the top of the set.

634
00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:20.141
Coming up here is one of my favourite
sequences of Stuart...

635
00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:21.977
where he's carrying the remote.

636
00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:26.815
And this is one of the sequences
where we used a digital prop.

637
00:34:26.982 --> 00:34:29.776
This is a digital remote control,
as opposed to a real one.

638
00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:34.239
And most of the time,
to try to integrate...

639
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:36.491
a CG character
into a live-action world...

640
00:34:36.658 --> 00:34:39.911
you try to have that character
interact with the environment.

641
00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:42.414
Whether it means bumping it or...
See those pebbles?

642
00:34:42.581 --> 00:34:44.583
That was another effects animation.

643
00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.502
There are little pebbles skittering
as Stuart runs around.

644
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:49.546
They try to include those things...

645
00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:52.799
just to really solidly put
the character in the scene.

646
00:34:52.966 --> 00:34:56.303
Most of the time that stuff
isn't gonna draw attention to itself...

647
00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.263
but it's picked up by the audience.

648
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.766
You can see the reflection also.
Stuart's reflection in the remote.

649
00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:04.185
There went some more rocks.
Saw those going there.

650
00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:06.104
And Eric Armstrong
did most of these.

651
00:35:06.271 --> 00:35:08.481
Remember that?
He did that whole sequence, Eric.

652
00:35:08.648 --> 00:35:11.443
I know how worried
you are about losing, believe me.

653
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.321
But you know what we say?
The thing that really matters...

654
00:35:14.487 --> 00:35:16.197
This scene is very interesting.

655
00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:20.201
The history of this scene,
George and Mr. Little talking.

656
00:35:20.702 --> 00:35:22.996
When we blocked the scene...

657
00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:27.542
we did not have a scene written
in the script that existed in that spot.

658
00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:30.211
And as we blocked the scene,
it was obvious to me...

659
00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:33.298
that there was an important moment
of storytelling...

660
00:35:33.465 --> 00:35:38.136
that was necessary for that moment
between George and his dad.

661
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:42.057
The night before we shot the scene,
I jotted down some ideas...

662
00:35:42.265 --> 00:35:45.310
and then the following morning,
before we shot the scene...

663
00:35:45.477 --> 00:35:48.647
I called Lowell Ganz...

664
00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:52.484
who was one of the writers
who was doing work on the script.

665
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:55.362
And I said, "You gotta help me."
This was his day off.

666
00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:57.906
I said, "Please, I'm supposed
to shoot this scene...

667
00:35:58.073 --> 00:36:01.743
and I have this idea
but it really needs a writer's polish."

668
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:06.081
So I was literally on the phone with him
as we were going through the scene...

669
00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:10.126
and he was giving me lines and stuff
and I was taking dictation...

670
00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:12.253
and about half an hour later...

671
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.091
I ran onto the set
with the scene for the actors to do.

672
00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:20.095
And it became a very important scene
in the storytelling...

673
00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:24.432
because it's where Mr. Little gives
George the advice to never give up...

674
00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:28.728
which is kind of a critical
thematic element through the story.

675
00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:31.731
And it's something
that Stuart actually embodies.

676
00:36:31.898 --> 00:36:35.276
Well, that's the thing.
It was really great how it worked out...

677
00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:38.405
because he's saying that
at the same time that Stuart is...

678
00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:40.281
never stopping trying.

679
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:43.410
Exactly. He's struggling with
the remote but he doesn't give up.

680
00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:45.120
- Till it gets crushed.
- Right.

681
00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:47.580
So, what does that say about
Hugh's moral lesson?

682
00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:50.959
- The point is, the remote gets crushed.
- That's right.

683
00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:53.002
And Stuart doesn't give up...

684
00:36:53.169 --> 00:36:57.799
and the next beat of the scene
is that he ends up...

685
00:36:57.966 --> 00:37:00.510
- on the boat.
- Exactly. He really doesn't stop.

686
00:37:00.677 --> 00:37:03.179
He doesn't give up.
He's a plucky mouse.

687
00:37:03.346 --> 00:37:06.057
He absolutely is.
That's Stuart's character.

688
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.144
He really doesn't see his limitations.

689
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:12.564
I have to say, even though the script
mentions him as a mouse...

690
00:37:12.731 --> 00:37:15.942
for me, Stuart the character,
I never thought of him as a mouse.

691
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:20.655
He's a character who happens to have
some of the characteristics of a mouse.

692
00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:24.159
- He looks somewhat like a mouse.
- Somewhat. Just like George said.

693
00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:27.996
All of this material on this side
of the bridge...

694
00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:32.167
was shot indoors on
Stage 30 at Columbia.

695
00:37:33.418 --> 00:37:35.378
But once they get out
beyond the bridge...

696
00:37:35.545 --> 00:37:40.759
they're in the larger pond,
where, really, the race takes place.

697
00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:44.262
And all of that material was shot
in the tank.

698
00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.765
It's an outdoor tank
at Paramount Pictures.

699
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:49.809
- Most of the year is a parking lot.
- Normally a parking lot.

700
00:37:49.976 --> 00:37:52.979
But they got rid of all the cars
and filled it with water.

701
00:37:53.146 --> 00:37:55.982
And then they turned it
into the boat pond.

702
00:37:56.149 --> 00:37:57.734
Some of the boats, interestingly...

703
00:37:57.901 --> 00:38:02.030
We actually had to design
each one of these ships.

704
00:38:02.197 --> 00:38:06.534
Give them all names.
And one of the things that we did was...

705
00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:11.915
create over-scaled ships
so we could get some of the shots...

706
00:38:12.081 --> 00:38:15.001
that you're seeing here.
If the boats were too small...

707
00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:18.296
you couldn't get close enough
to the ships with the camera...

708
00:38:18.463 --> 00:38:20.548
and the depth of field
would be a problem.

709
00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:24.761
So some of the boats are actually
twice as big as the regular boats.

710
00:38:24.928 --> 00:38:28.640
Then all of them are being pulled
along tracks...

711
00:38:29.432 --> 00:38:31.392
you know,
so that you could do a shot...

712
00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:35.730
and the choreography would be
established by the tracks.

713
00:38:35.897 --> 00:38:38.358
And then if you needed
to redo the take...

714
00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:41.402
you'd actually be able to pull
the boats backward...

715
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:44.155
back to their original position
and then rerun it.

716
00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:47.325
As opposed to doing it all
with just free remote-control boats...

717
00:38:47.492 --> 00:38:51.996
which would be almost impossible
to repeat any kind of action.

718
00:38:57.752 --> 00:39:00.088
The photography of those boats...

719
00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:03.424
the plates,
all the boats were match-moved...

720
00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:05.844
where there's a computer version
of the boat...

721
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.429
which is lined up
with the live-action version.

722
00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:12.600
I love this shot where he gulps.
You can see the blowing fur on there.

723
00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.978
That's very nice.
And his clothing blowing.

724
00:39:15.144 --> 00:39:16.729
All that's match-moved...

725
00:39:16.896 --> 00:39:20.732
and then Stuart is put into the boat
and tracked with the shot.

726
00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:23.695
- What is he doing?
- I think he's hiking out.

727
00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:27.532
I like shots like this.
There he goes. He brings himself up.

728
00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:29.784
In a lot of the close-ups
in the boat race...

729
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:33.621
you will see the blowing fur
and blowing clothing...

730
00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:36.791
as well as the animation...

731
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:39.919
the normal animation
that we did on the clothing.

732
00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:42.505
This was another scene
that was inspired by the book.

733
00:39:42.922 --> 00:39:46.509
There's a very important scene
where Stuart sails the <i>Wasp...</i>

734
00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:49.804
although the <i>Wasp</i> in the book
is owned by...

735
00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:51.472
By the doctor?

736
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:54.851
I think so. I think it is. Yeah, it is.

737
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:57.478
- But we decided to try...
- That's how he meets him.

738
00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.397
Meets him in the park with the boat.

739
00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:03.484
He sails the boat to victory, the doctor
brings him back, gives him the car.

740
00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:07.030
So we knew we wanted to use that...

741
00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:09.824
because it's a very important
set piece in the book.

742
00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:13.786
And it's something people who have
read the book remember distinctly.

743
00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:18.666
And yet we incorporated that
into our story about the family.

744
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:21.377
So, of course,
we gave the <i>Wasp</i> to George.

745
00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:23.922
And here you'll get to see
Stuart's teeth.

746
00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:28.009
Because he has a real
set of human-modelled...

747
00:40:28.176 --> 00:40:29.344
Human teeth.

748
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:34.349
Actually, one of the executives
at Sony Pictures Imageworks...

749
00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:37.352
provided Stuart's dental work.

750
00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:40.396
- That would be Barry. Barry Weiss.
- Barry Weiss.

751
00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:42.607
Something's wrong.

752
00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:45.360
So, meanwhile,
Stuart's struggling with the boat.

753
00:40:45.526 --> 00:40:49.530
We're about to see... I think this one
was kind of our tribute...

754
00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:53.284
to Douglas Fairbanks here,
when he slides down the sail.

755
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:57.205
Sort of like <i>The Thief of Bagdad.</i>

756
00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.422
Yeah!

757
00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:08.925
Yeah!

758
00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:18.142
Of course, the Manhattan skyline is
a matte painting that was added later.

759
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:21.104
So all those shots...
Many of the shots done on the bridge...

760
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:25.400
facing the crowd on the bridge,
were done against a blue screen.

761
00:41:26.609 --> 00:41:31.781
Now here we're about to the point
where one of the shots that we had...

762
00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:35.243
That we cut from the movie.
We went directly here to the trophy.

763
00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.328
- Remember the...?
- Exactly.

764
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:39.789
- But then it made its way back in.
- Right.

765
00:41:39.956 --> 00:41:42.375
- But I think it was a good decision.
- Yeah.

766
00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:45.670
The family is actually made up
of a bunch of great character actors.

767
00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:47.463
I wanted to point some of them out.

768
00:41:49.257 --> 00:41:51.092
Besides Geena Davis
and Hugh Laurie...

769
00:41:51.259 --> 00:41:54.679
we have Harold Gould, you'll notice,
with the white hair.

770
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:57.140
Next to him is Allyce Beasley.

771
00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:58.891
That's Jeffrey Jones...

772
00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:02.270
who you'll recognise from <i>Beetlejuice</i>
and <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off.</i>

773
00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:05.023
<i>- Amadeus</i> too.
- And <i>Amadeus.</i> Exactly.

774
00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:08.526
And Connie Ray's in the background.

775
00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:11.487
That's Patrick O'Brien
with the camera.

776
00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:13.865
- Brian Doyle-Murray.
- Brian is on the left.

777
00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:16.701
Brian Doyle being the brother
of Bill Murray.

778
00:42:17.243 --> 00:42:20.371
This is the happiest moment
of my life.

779
00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:23.791
And they really made a wonderful,
sort of quirky family...

780
00:42:23.958 --> 00:42:26.961
which is the quality we were trying
to convey for the Littles.

781
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:31.215
We thought, "What kind of family would
want to adopt a mouse as a child?"

782
00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.968
We needed to come up with
some eccentric characters...

783
00:42:34.135 --> 00:42:35.803
to make that believable.

784
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:39.932
And just when Stuart is at the pinnacle
of his happiness...

785
00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:43.519
- The rug is pulled out from under him.
- Fate rings his doorbell.

786
00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:48.399
In the form of two little mice played
by Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.

787
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:51.486
- Bruno being the short one.
- Wonderfully played, I might add.

788
00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:55.323
Jennifer, actually,
when we were modelling the mouse...

789
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.325
the Camille Stout mouse...

790
00:42:57.492 --> 00:43:00.495
we actually made some modifications
to the model...

791
00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:04.165
to make it look a little bit more
like Jennifer.

792
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:07.335
Took one of her headshots
and sort of made some modifications...

793
00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:10.046
You see that peanut?
They spent a great deal of time...

794
00:43:10.213 --> 00:43:13.591
trying to make that digital peanut
look like a real peanut.

795
00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:16.552
With little particles breaking off
when he bit it.

796
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:21.474
And this was a...
When we got into doing this section...

797
00:43:21.641 --> 00:43:24.352
I think for the animators,
this was a lot of fun.

798
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:27.355
Pretty much all the animators wanted
to do the Stouts...

799
00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:30.525
because they loved the voices,
they gave a lot of character.

800
00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:33.569
And also, it was great having
two characters to react.

801
00:43:33.736 --> 00:43:35.863
See how she puts her arm up on him
and reacts?

802
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.825
It's really great to have two or more
characters in a shot...

803
00:43:38.991 --> 00:43:41.119
so you can get them to play off
one another.

804
00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:42.787
You can touch one another.

805
00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:46.666
They can help direct your eye
where you're supposed to be looking.

806
00:43:46.833 --> 00:43:50.378
One can move and the other one can
kind of stop, go back and forth.

807
00:43:50.545 --> 00:43:54.382
And through this whole thing
we wanted Reginald Stout...

808
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:57.135
to just keep eating peanuts.
That's his theme.

809
00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:59.720
One thing about
how this scene was created...

810
00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:02.306
when we shot this scene
on the set...

811
00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:07.562
Jim Doughan, who actually appears
in the film as Detective Allen...

812
00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:09.438
You'll see them later in the film.

813
00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:11.816
And he's one of the voices of the cats,
Lucky.

814
00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:14.902
He was reading all
of Stuart's dialogue on the set.

815
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:17.989
That was his original job.

816
00:44:18.156 --> 00:44:21.701
When we went through the scenes with
the actors, he'd read lines off camera.

817
00:44:21.868 --> 00:44:23.995
He did the same for the Stouts
in this scene.

818
00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:29.250
And he got a barrel full
of ice cream cones...

819
00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:32.003
that he was using to make
the sound of the peanuts.

820
00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.047
As he would deliver the lines,
he was chomping on the cones...

821
00:44:35.214 --> 00:44:37.008
and making a pig of himself.

822
00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:40.011
And that's what Geena and Hugh
are reacting to...

823
00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:44.932
to give all those great, wonderful
reactions to Mr. Stout eating peanuts.

824
00:44:45.099 --> 00:44:48.603
And this shot here was one of the most
difficult shots in the movie...

825
00:44:48.769 --> 00:44:52.523
coming up when the Stouts
are gonna come in and join Stuart.

826
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.108
Because the...

827
00:44:54.275 --> 00:44:58.196
Not only are there three characters
in the shot and each one of them was...

828
00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:01.365
a fairly heavy character
on the computer to deal with...

829
00:45:01.908 --> 00:45:03.701
but also it's a really long shot.

830
00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.037
It's one of the longer shots
in the movie.

831
00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:07.997
- Here it comes now.
- This shot?

832
00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:09.498
Yeah, this one right here.

833
00:45:09.665 --> 00:45:15.421
And again, I'm sure you, you know,
had to do a lot of this on <i>Lion King...</i>

834
00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:18.591
but the choreography of a scene
like this is really important.

835
00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:21.928
When a character is talking and
when another character is talking...

836
00:45:22.094 --> 00:45:25.056
we're directing the audience
where to look.

837
00:45:25.348 --> 00:45:28.351
So I think that one...
I was very happy with that shot.

838
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:30.436
Hey, taxi!

839
00:45:31.604 --> 00:45:33.981
What's a mouse have to do
to get a cab in this city?

840
00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:36.108
And now we're outside.

841
00:45:36.525 --> 00:45:39.654
This is another really nice shot.
The weight of the bag.

842
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.407
Yeah. And the reflection
in the water of Stuart.

843
00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:47.119
But everything. I think the lighting
in this particular scene...

844
00:45:47.286 --> 00:45:49.705
the way it was photographed,
is very successful...

845
00:45:49.872 --> 00:45:52.500
in conveying the mood
and the atmosphere for this...

846
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:55.544
very critical, emotional scene
in the movie.

847
00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:59.006
And it helps bring out the contours
in Stuart and in the Stouts.

848
00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:02.510
Because when they are, you know,
those light colours, it's really hard.

849
00:46:04.637 --> 00:46:06.514
The shot where
she's gonna pick him up...

850
00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:09.100
this is all another big tracking job.

851
00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:12.520
Just speaking technical for a minute,
to track Stuart into the hand...

852
00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:15.481
and to get him to feel
like he's truly in the hand...

853
00:46:15.648 --> 00:46:17.566
and she kissed him,
a lot of lining up.

854
00:46:17.733 --> 00:46:19.986
But in that shot,
what's interesting is that...

855
00:46:20.152 --> 00:46:24.991
Stuart was added but the actual bag,
the suitcase was physically there.

856
00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:27.493
That was a prop that was built
for Hugh to pick up.

857
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.495
Like this one coming up
as he goes down.

858
00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:32.790
- This is a long shot too.
- The bag is real but Stuart is not.

859
00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:36.961
See how Stuart keeps trying
to look at Mom? This is one that was...

860
00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:39.380
There's one thing at the end
of this animation.

861
00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:43.551
It's not really that noticeable,
but something we added last minute.

862
00:46:43.718 --> 00:46:46.554
Watch how he will...
Dave Mullins animated this shot.

863
00:46:46.721 --> 00:46:49.557
Watch how he'll put his hands
on the bag...

864
00:46:49.724 --> 00:46:52.393
and he looks down
and just lets it... drop off.

865
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.980
It just says everything.
He's so crestfallen and heartbroken.

866
00:47:00.943 --> 00:47:02.611
Boy, that looks heavy.

867
00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:04.030
See, they just fit.

868
00:47:04.196 --> 00:47:05.364
Camille?

869
00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:07.783
The other kind of liberty
we were taking...

870
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:11.329
was this whole notion
that Mr. Stout hails a cab.

871
00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:16.417
How do mice travel in Manhattan?
I guess they travel like everybody else.

872
00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:20.504
It's funny
because the whole world they live in...

873
00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:23.341
is just where talking animals
are just a part of life.

874
00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:26.093
I mean, no one seems
to really bat an eye.

875
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.180
If a mouse comes and sits down
at a diner for a cup of coffee...

876
00:47:29.347 --> 00:47:31.766
- they bring it to him.
- Exactly.

877
00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:33.517
But you're not.

878
00:47:34.143 --> 00:47:36.020
She is.

879
00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:40.191
Stuart!

880
00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:44.278
Here comes George with the car.

881
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.072
George?

882
00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:49.742
See that little animation in the back
between Reggie and Camille?

883
00:47:49.909 --> 00:47:54.747
We sort of play... It's very subtle.
We played that like, "The jig is up."

884
00:47:54.914 --> 00:47:57.583
Only after you've seen the film...

885
00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:01.921
do you recognise that the Stouts
are not really Stuart's parents.

886
00:48:02.088 --> 00:48:04.799
And there's a whole reality
that has to be played...

887
00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:08.386
about what they're thinking
as all this stuff is going on.

888
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:10.888
Just like Stuart...

889
00:48:11.055 --> 00:48:13.849
the animators had to understand
who the Stouts were...

890
00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:16.811
a little bit about their background
and their motivation.

891
00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:19.271
In fact, we sort of played it...

892
00:48:19.438 --> 00:48:22.441
that Camille really did want to have
a child and she couldn't.

893
00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:25.528
- So this was her opportunity.
- One of my favourite shots.

894
00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:27.988
- I kept making Henry redo it.
- He did, he did.

895
00:48:28.155 --> 00:48:30.074
Initially, we were doing
a waving thing.

896
00:48:30.241 --> 00:48:33.702
And Rob kept saying,
"No, put the hand up. Just leave it up."

897
00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:37.331
- And you were right.
- That's a thing about performance...

898
00:48:37.498 --> 00:48:40.292
in this medium, is that...

899
00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:43.504
the tendency to overdo things
is common among animators.

900
00:48:43.671 --> 00:48:46.215
I think they get excited
they can move things around.

901
00:48:46.382 --> 00:48:49.176
- Certainly, I'm not guilty of that.
- No, no, no. Never.

902
00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:53.389
But that's always... The temptation is
to do as much as possible.

903
00:48:53.556 --> 00:48:57.726
Is to make everything moving
at the same time.

904
00:48:57.893 --> 00:49:04.442
I think the difference between
the better-quality animation...

905
00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:06.902
is that there's a simplicity to it.

906
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:10.698
That there's a directness
and a simplicity.

907
00:49:10.865 --> 00:49:15.411
That's what Henry and I talked about
when we were starting on the project.

908
00:49:15.578 --> 00:49:18.456
To try to make sure that
the sensibility of the performance...

909
00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:22.668
- was really in line with that.
- I think the animators, by and large...

910
00:49:22.835 --> 00:49:26.213
I mean, we did have some
experienced animators on our crew.

911
00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:31.093
We also had a lot of young animators
who hadn't been doing this for long.

912
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.555
And I think that being able to focus
on one character...

913
00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:37.475
for this many shots...

914
00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:41.228
I think all of us learned a lot.
And they certainly learned.

915
00:49:41.395 --> 00:49:44.231
By the time we got to the end
of the film...

916
00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:45.733
I think we were...

917
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.569
We'd like to have gone back
and redone a few shots.

918
00:49:48.736 --> 00:49:50.738
The bridge shot,
the Brooklyn Bridge shot...

919
00:49:50.905 --> 00:49:54.658
was actually one of the few things
that was shot on location.

920
00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:58.162
So that was actually shot
in New York.

921
00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:02.208
The first shot being, you know,
achieved on a helicopter.

922
00:50:02.374 --> 00:50:05.628
And then the other ones done
actually on the bridge.

923
00:50:05.794 --> 00:50:10.132
Which if you haven't been
to Manhattan, there's a walkway...

924
00:50:10.299 --> 00:50:12.510
a pedestrian walkway
in the bridge...

925
00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:15.930
which is where we ended up
putting the car.

926
00:50:16.096 --> 00:50:19.266
This shot coming up,
I like very much as well...

927
00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:21.852
because the lighting on this...

928
00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:25.856
also gave really nice form
to the characters.

929
00:50:26.023 --> 00:50:28.567
The light coming from up there
and the interaction...

930
00:50:28.734 --> 00:50:33.656
That's all CG. CG suitcase,
CG cloth on the bed.

931
00:50:33.822 --> 00:50:36.742
If you look in the background,
you'll notice a baseball card...

932
00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:38.285
and it's Willie Mays.

933
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:42.122
- Was that from your collection?
- No, but I grew up in the Bay Area.

934
00:50:42.289 --> 00:50:45.084
So the San Francisco Giants were
important in my youth...

935
00:50:45.251 --> 00:50:49.296
and Willie Mays was,
you know, a hero.

936
00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:52.800
I think Stuart might be more
of a Yankees fan.

937
00:50:52.967 --> 00:50:54.677
Possibly.

938
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:57.471
There he is.

939
00:51:01.809 --> 00:51:05.396
Now, this was where the
"have breakfast" sequence used to be.

940
00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:07.731
Yes, the "have breakfast" sequence.

941
00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.192
There was a whole scene
where Stuart...

942
00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:12.486
was sitting at the table
with the Stouts...

943
00:51:12.653 --> 00:51:15.489
where they we talking to him about
what they were gonna do.

944
00:51:15.656 --> 00:51:19.201
Later on, Stuart was interested to find
out more about his mouse family...

945
00:51:19.368 --> 00:51:21.078
and Mr. Stout suggested...

946
00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:24.331
they go to an Italian restaurant
and forage through a dumpster.

947
00:51:24.498 --> 00:51:26.917
Which didn't make it in the final cut.

948
00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:29.753
He also told Stuart,
"Never trust them."

949
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.548
- "Never trust family."
- Yeah. "Family. Never trust them."

950
00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:36.302
But first, how are things going?

951
00:51:36.468 --> 00:51:39.138
- Oh, it's been difficult.
- Difficult?

952
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:40.347
No, very difficult.

953
00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:43.183
This is one where there's
some good editing on Snowbell.

954
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:46.145
So that Snowbell appears
to be hearing what's going on here.

955
00:51:46.312 --> 00:51:49.023
The interesting challenge
about the movie in general was...

956
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:50.608
how to treat the cats.

957
00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:53.694
Because Stuart can talk
to the people...

958
00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:57.906
but you'll notice
that the cats never talk to the people.

959
00:51:58.073 --> 00:52:01.785
The logic there,
which is sort of a logical illogic...

960
00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:06.206
is that the cats, being real cats,
act as pets in the family.

961
00:52:06.373 --> 00:52:10.127
And that they could talk with Stuart,
Stuart could talk with them...

962
00:52:10.294 --> 00:52:12.713
but Stuart was the only one
who talked to humans.

963
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.215
At first, when we were talking
about this idea...

964
00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:18.719
everybody was a bit nervous about
how that would come across...

965
00:52:18.886 --> 00:52:21.055
and whether people would
question it.

966
00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:24.350
And what we found is
once we established that rule...

967
00:52:24.516 --> 00:52:25.976
that pattern of behaviour...

968
00:52:26.143 --> 00:52:28.228
that people just didn't even
recognise it.

969
00:52:28.395 --> 00:52:30.314
People don't even notice it.

970
00:52:30.481 --> 00:52:31.815
Two-for-one sale.

971
00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.484
That's a very heavy soup.

972
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:36.236
That, of course, is Julia Sweeney...

973
00:52:36.403 --> 00:52:39.740
who you might remember from on
<i>Saturday Night Live,</i> who played...

974
00:52:39.907 --> 00:52:42.993
One of her most familiar characters
is Pat...

975
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.746
the gender-confused character.

976
00:52:45.913 --> 00:52:48.123
But they've been gone for years.

977
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:49.917
Years?

978
00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:54.463
And coming up is the one place where
we kind of bent the rule a little bit...

979
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:59.093
because you'll hear a vocal
performance by Nathan Lane...

980
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:01.011
who plays Snowbell...

981
00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:04.932
in that shot where he reacts to the
fact they're gonna call in the police.

982
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:08.602
Dear, we have to take this up
with the police.

983
00:53:09.687 --> 00:53:12.606
So in this scene,
the police detectives arrive.

984
00:53:12.773 --> 00:53:17.152
And you'll see that's Jim Doughan
getting out of the car.

985
00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:21.865
And with Jim is Jon Polito,
who's a great character actor.

986
00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:23.492
I'm Detective Sherman.

987
00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:25.786
- Allen and Sherman. Allen Sherman.
- Exactly.

988
00:53:25.953 --> 00:53:29.790
Detective Sherman and Detective Allen,
which is a tribute to Allan Sherman.

989
00:53:31.792 --> 00:53:34.294
Slightly obtuse reference.

990
00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:38.132
I don't think we've talked about
Steve Zahn yet, who's just amazing.

991
00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:43.137
Oh, yeah, Steve Zahn, who is just
an incredible, incredible comic actor...

992
00:53:43.303 --> 00:53:45.305
did the voice of Monty.

993
00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:50.185
The voice of Smokey is done
by Chazz Palminteri...

994
00:53:50.352 --> 00:53:53.647
who I'm sure you're familiar with.
He plays a lot of gangsters.

995
00:53:53.939 --> 00:53:56.817
That was the quality that we wanted
to convey with Smokey...

996
00:53:56.984 --> 00:53:58.986
who's the leader
of the underworld cats.

997
00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:02.740
And Nathan Lane. Nathan, of course,
playing the part of Snowbell...

998
00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:04.783
and playing it quite brilliantly.

999
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:09.496
And Monty, who is kind of Snowbell's
goofball sidekick.

1000
00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:12.416
The cat who played Monty...

1001
00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:15.335
those particular markings,
I think, were...

1002
00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:18.088
Really worked well
with the animation.

1003
00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:22.009
He has probably one of the more
expressive faces.

1004
00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:25.179
I think when the guys
at R&H and Centropolis...

1005
00:54:25.345 --> 00:54:29.141
shifted the area around the eyes,
they really got a lot of acting out of it.

1006
00:54:29.308 --> 00:54:31.435
The natural fur colours
around the face...

1007
00:54:31.602 --> 00:54:34.480
really lent themselves very well
to animation.

1008
00:54:34.646 --> 00:54:38.609
And since both studios were using
virtually the same technique...

1009
00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:41.111
which is that they were...

1010
00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:44.364
What's called match-moving.
Taking a computer-generated object...

1011
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:49.369
and then matching the movement
of a live-action object...

1012
00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:52.039
or, in this case,
live-action character, the cat...

1013
00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:56.502
and they match it up and
they actually replace the cat's face...

1014
00:54:56.668 --> 00:55:00.422
with a computer-generated face.
They add the fur and the texturing...

1015
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:03.509
and that allows them to do
all the subtle animation you see.

1016
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:06.512
And that was something that, again...

1017
00:55:06.678 --> 00:55:08.889
was a technique perfected
in the movie <i>Babe.</i>

1018
00:55:09.932 --> 00:55:14.102
Rhythm & Hues, who did
quite a bit of work on this movie...

1019
00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:16.897
did all of the work, I think,
on both <i>Babes.</i>

1020
00:55:17.064 --> 00:55:18.899
They did.

1021
00:55:19.066 --> 00:55:21.693
<i>Babe</i> and <i>Babe: Pig in the City.</i>

1022
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:23.987
And, yeah, they did that.

1023
00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.740
And a project I worked on
over there...

1024
00:55:26.907 --> 00:55:28.951
was the first few
polar bear commercials.

1025
00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:31.912
And we used a lot of that
same technique to do the face.

1026
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:34.206
It's a very similar type of face.

1027
00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:37.876
But, again, when you do that,
what you're doing, really...

1028
00:55:38.043 --> 00:55:43.423
is cutting together the dialogue
that you've recorded in...

1029
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:45.717
On a studio. On a studio?

1030
00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:48.303
You don't record on a studio,
you record in a studio.

1031
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.848
- You could be on the studio.
- I guess.

1032
00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:53.767
So once you've actually recorded
the dialogue...

1033
00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:57.020
And normally you record
the actors separately...

1034
00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:00.566
so that they'll come in in a separate
session and do the dialogue.

1035
00:56:00.732 --> 00:56:03.777
You get all those bits and pieces
together, all the dialogue...

1036
00:56:03.944 --> 00:56:08.073
and then you select the different bits
of takes from the cat's performance.

1037
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.619
And then once you've finished
all that, then you turn it over...

1038
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:15.455
to either Rhythm & Hues
or Centropolis...

1039
00:56:15.622 --> 00:56:19.418
take the cat's performance
or the cat's physical acting...

1040
00:56:19.585 --> 00:56:22.337
and then do a facial replacement...

1041
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:25.966
so that they're manipulating
the eyes and the mouth...

1042
00:56:26.133 --> 00:56:30.512
and trying to, you know,
make it believable.

1043
00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:33.974
I think Bruno and Jennifer were
the only ones we recorded together.

1044
00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:36.685
There were sessions
we were able to get them together...

1045
00:56:36.852 --> 00:56:40.397
which was great to establish, again,
a rapport between those two.

1046
00:56:40.564 --> 00:56:43.025
As husband and wife,
they had to have a kind of...

1047
00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:45.944
you know, intuitive aspect
to each other to know...

1048
00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:48.447
what each other
were gonna say and do.

1049
00:56:48.614 --> 00:56:52.284
I love this exchange that's just about
to occur between Mr. and Mrs. Stout.

1050
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:54.494
Mrs. Stout's had a costume change,
you see.

1051
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:56.747
She's no longer wearing her coat.

1052
00:56:56.914 --> 00:56:58.624
That's gotta hurt.

1053
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:02.210
That was really fun to animate.

1054
00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:05.714
See that little Bill Irwin-inspired walk?
See how he lifted his foot up?

1055
00:57:05.881 --> 00:57:09.259
Did a lot of that Bill Irwin,
Buster Keaton kind of stuff.

1056
00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:13.430
Lifting his feet up and landing
on his heels as he walks forward.

1057
00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:15.015
When we were all so happy?

1058
00:57:15.182 --> 00:57:16.558
- Yes!
- Yes!

1059
00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:20.354
And one of the shots coming up here
in a minute was very challenging.

1060
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.482
You can see Mr. Stout's arms
are really, really short.

1061
00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:27.277
In fact, without scaling them up
in some shots like we did...

1062
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:30.614
he can't cross his hands in front
of him. His arms are too short.

1063
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:32.574
But look what
he's supposed to do here.

1064
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:35.202
Rob, you wanted to have him
grab him around the face?

1065
00:57:35.369 --> 00:57:37.329
- Right.
- Which we really couldn't do.

1066
00:57:37.496 --> 00:57:40.832
I remember when we came up
with the idea of doing it...

1067
00:57:40.999 --> 00:57:44.211
as this kind of an
over-the-shoulder shot from Stuart...

1068
00:57:44.378 --> 00:57:47.506
so that it appears that Mr. Stout
is grabbing Stuart's lapels...

1069
00:57:47.673 --> 00:57:49.383
when in fact he can't reach them.

1070
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:52.052
But it works. And I love this.

1071
00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:54.805
That was all done at Imageworks,
that pullback there.

1072
00:57:54.972 --> 00:57:57.057
That was originally
a locked-off plate.

1073
00:57:57.224 --> 00:57:59.977
And we were able to get
that whole sort of...

1074
00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:03.063
start on Mr. Stout and pull back
as Mrs. Stout comes in.

1075
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:05.899
Bye, fake father!
Goodbye, fake mother!

1076
00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:07.442
There he goes, off in the car.

1077
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:11.530
Again, a CG Stuart match-moved
into the car...

1078
00:58:11.697 --> 00:58:14.074
so that he could wave...

1079
00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:17.536
and act.

1080
00:58:21.456 --> 00:58:24.126
- George.
- Well, I think we have to...

1081
00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:26.253
- Tell him.
- Yeah.

1082
00:58:26.586 --> 00:58:29.423
Now, in this scene,
the Littles have come back...

1083
00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:32.217
and they're going to break
the news to George...

1084
00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:36.513
that the police have, you know,
told them that it seems hopeless...

1085
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.099
that they'll ever find Stuart.

1086
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:41.810
And the family is, meanwhile...

1087
00:58:41.977 --> 00:58:45.105
carrying through on the theme
of never giving up.

1088
00:58:45.272 --> 00:58:48.942
They've rallied around the idea
of making these posters...

1089
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:54.197
to put up all over the city
to see if they can locate Stuart.

1090
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:58.410
And, again, this was an element,
a thematic idea...

1091
00:58:58.577 --> 00:59:04.624
that was incorporated fairly late
in the process of making this movie.

1092
00:59:04.791 --> 00:59:07.085
This wasn't a scene
in the original script...

1093
00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:09.463
but as we were going
into production...

1094
00:59:10.088 --> 00:59:13.800
a lot of work was continuing...

1095
00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:16.636
you know,
and continued to be done...

1096
00:59:16.803 --> 00:59:18.930
in terms of adding extra scenes
and ideas...

1097
00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:21.141
that would flesh out
the end of the movie.

1098
00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:22.476
It dovetailed so well...

1099
00:59:22.642 --> 00:59:25.395
taking the photograph of Stuart
and cutting it out...

1100
00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:29.316
so that later that gives Snowbell
just that little bit of ammunition...

1101
00:59:29.483 --> 00:59:31.651
which he uses against Stuart.

1102
00:59:32.444 --> 00:59:36.198
I love this shot
because it really takes, I mean...

1103
00:59:36.364 --> 00:59:39.367
Rob and I both have roots
in 2D animation...

1104
00:59:39.534 --> 00:59:42.829
and this sort of is the only shot
in the movie that's sort of...

1105
00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:46.666
You know, it feels like an old-fashioned
kind of shot.

1106
00:59:46.833 --> 00:59:48.627
Hey, moron!

1107
00:59:48.794 --> 00:59:51.338
But it was also done
just to find some variation...

1108
00:59:51.505 --> 00:59:54.174
in the approach to visualising
the story.

1109
00:59:54.341 --> 00:59:56.384
Because if you did everything
the same way...

1110
00:59:56.551 --> 00:59:58.512
with the cats particularly...

1111
00:59:58.678 --> 01:00:01.431
it, you know, might get a bit dull.

1112
01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:05.268
That was the real Times Square.

1113
01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:07.521
Nice shot.
That is another location shot.

1114
01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.773
- That was done on location.
- John Dykstra.

1115
01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:12.442
You'll notice in the background
there's a billboard...

1116
01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:14.694
for <i>The Lion King</i> stage play.

1117
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.196
I hadn't seen that.

1118
01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:24.037
But this of course was the shot
that was created in the...

1119
01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.705
I love this.

1120
01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:29.584
You were talking earlier about
the shot on the doorstep.

1121
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.837
This one also has
great mood lighting.

1122
01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.964
And, again, all these are...

1123
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.341
Most of these shots through here...

1124
01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:41.304
- I think this one might have been...
- This one is an animatronic Stuart.

1125
01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:44.391
The first couple you saw there
were CG Stuarts.

1126
01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:46.351
And then here, this one is just great.

1127
01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:49.312
I mean, the lighting
on this whole sequence is terrific.

1128
01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:52.983
And you see the reflections
on the car...

1129
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:58.405
are done with an interesting
process called...

1130
01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.323
- Ray tracing.
- Ray tracing.

1131
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.409
And what that means is that...

1132
01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:07.122
through a complex
mathematical formula...

1133
01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:11.585
they're able to project the light
that would literally hit Stuart...

1134
01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:14.754
and bounce off the car.
So you'll see in the reflection...

1135
01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:18.508
that it's actually Stuart's back and
his side being reflected in the car...

1136
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.970
which are angles that you're not
physically seeing on Stuart.

1137
01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:25.515
They're the true reflection of what
would be there if Stuart were there.

1138
01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:29.060
And those are the only
ray-traced shots in the movie.

1139
01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:30.520
What's your hurry, Murray?

1140
01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.147
Yeah, where you going, Murray...?

1141
01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:35.859
There's Red, who is a new cat
character played by David Alan Grier...

1142
01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:39.112
who you might know from
<i>In Living Color</i> or <i>Jumanji.</i>

1143
01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.697
Lucky, Red, get him. Come on!

1144
01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:44.367
And now we're off and running
on our chase.

1145
01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.913
In these shots here,
this one was a digital shot.

1146
01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:52.459
We tried to have Stuart react
to the things that he bumped into...

1147
01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.961
so he wasn't just locked
to the car.

1148
01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.882
It was great
that we got to add a shot here too...

1149
01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.343
which was this finger-pointing shot
coming up.

1150
01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:03.637
Actually, he's trying
to start the car here.

1151
01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:07.974
That really helped heighten
the excitement.

1152
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.939
- Pretty exciting.
- Yes, exactly.

1153
01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:16.316
Well, we wanted to capitalise
on the idea...

1154
01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:18.985
that Stuart could be driving
in a high-speed chase.

1155
01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:22.030
You know, it seemed like a fantasy
wish-fulfilment thing.

1156
01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:26.076
If you owned a little car like this,
you'd imagine being able to do it.

1157
01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.496
And we wanted to convey
a sense of danger with the cats...

1158
01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:33.500
because, generally, cats are
fairly benign, you know, creatures.

1159
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:36.211
- Generally.
- Unless you're four inches tall.

1160
01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.672
And look somewhat like a mouse...

1161
01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:42.550
in which case, cats spell danger.

1162
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:46.054
There's our stuntman shot,
arms and legs wiggling.

1163
01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:48.098
A great splash
from the effects team...

1164
01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:51.017
sort of matching Stuart
into the shot.

1165
01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:57.315
So here we turn to doing a lot more,
quite a bit more with the wet fur.

1166
01:02:57.482 --> 01:02:59.192
This is probably the most extensive.

1167
01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.403
We had some earlier
in the washing machine...

1168
01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:04.364
but this is wet fur
combined with effects.

1169
01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:07.575
There's lots of drips coming off Stuart
when he shakes his head...

1170
01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:09.536
coming up here.

1171
01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:13.164
There it is. And all the drops flew off.

1172
01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:16.626
He's dripping through this whole thing.
There's a close-up coming up...

1173
01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:20.880
and of all this fur is clumped.
These are individual hairs...

1174
01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:23.717
that are controlled
by what we call control hairs...

1175
01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:27.304
and they're all clumped together
and appear wet.

1176
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.390
And some of these shots were done...

1177
01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:33.727
with an actual
three-dimensional suitcase...

1178
01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:39.733
that was shot and then match-moved
for Stuart to be riding on top of.

1179
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:43.445
Here we are with family. Jeffrey Jones,
Connie Ray and Patrick O'Brien...

1180
01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:47.574
- playing members of the Little family.
- The ads on the taxi cabs were fun too.

1181
01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:50.744
Brian Doyle-Murray, Allyce Beasley
and Harold Gould...

1182
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.538
who you'd know from <i>The Sting</i>
many years ago.

1183
01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:55.498
Favourite film of mine.

1184
01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:58.918
And Estelle Getty,
who was one of the Golden Girls.

1185
01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:01.254
Where do I go?

1186
01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.965
You come with us.
We're gonna circle the park.

1187
01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.969
Now, again, this whole throughline
of the story...

1188
01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.347
where the family's going out
to do posters...

1189
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.766
came fairly late in the production.

1190
01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:16.519
And, in fact, many of these scenes
were written...

1191
01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.189
while we were actually
shooting the movie.

1192
01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:22.817
So I remember having many late nights
in the trailer after shooting...

1193
01:04:22.984 --> 01:04:25.653
talking with the writers
and the actors...

1194
01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.697
about what these scenes would be.

1195
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:30.825
And, in fact,
it was Hugh Laurie's contribution...

1196
01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.286
a very important
story contribution...

1197
01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:35.580
that becomes important
in this next scene...

1198
01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:39.125
when Stuart comes home
and then Snowbell...

1199
01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:42.587
you know, fools him into thinking
that the Littles don't love him.

1200
01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:46.049
That little hatch door there
was a real one.

1201
01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:49.636
Mom, Dad, George!

1202
01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:54.641
Now, this scene, again,
this actual scene was shot, I think...

1203
01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:57.769
at the very end
of principal photography.

1204
01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:01.398
And the original cinematographer,
Guillermo Navarro...

1205
01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:03.316
who did a wonderful job...

1206
01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:06.194
couldn't shoot this because
of a conflict in his schedule.

1207
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:10.365
And so we brought in another DP
named Matt Leonetti...

1208
01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:13.827
who came in to shoot this and,
of course, he had the challenge...

1209
01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.746
of matching the style
and the lighting...

1210
01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:20.375
that Guillermo had established
through the rest of the picture.

1211
01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:26.214
But, again, all these shots were done
with, you know, the real cat, obviously.

1212
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:29.759
He wasn't acting with a real mouse.
The real mouse had to be added later.

1213
01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:34.514
So there was a tremendous amount of,
you know, imagination...

1214
01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:39.769
that went into shooting this scene
because Stuart wasn't there.

1215
01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.313
Little camera moves like that
had to be created...

1216
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.608
for a character
that would be brought in later.

1217
01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.193
Look up there.

1218
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.572
And the other thing is, again,
the choreographing of a scene.

1219
01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:54.534
It was very important to keep
the characters moving.

1220
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:58.204
So you'll notice in the scene,
Snowbell starts on the highest step...

1221
01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:00.582
and he walks down and jumps
to the floor...

1222
01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:03.001
and ultimately gets up
onto the table...

1223
01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:06.296
where this very critical story beat
takes place.

1224
01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:09.799
Nice bit of acting here.
We don't see what Stuart's seeing yet.

1225
01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:12.510
And Todd Pilger animated that shot.

1226
01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:13.720
That's just...

1227
01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:16.181
I think it's great
that you see on his face...

1228
01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:20.560
that there's concern and alarm
before you actually see what's there.

1229
01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:24.063
And then here's where Snowbell
really starts to lay it on.

1230
01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:27.066
He's so darn evil.

1231
01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.528
But this is one of the
most successful scenes...

1232
01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:34.824
in terms of performance, I think,
from both the cat and from Stuart.

1233
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:39.746
And, you know, the fact that audiences
so completely accept...

1234
01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:42.373
who these characters are
and what's going on...

1235
01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.418
that you really identify, you know,
with Stuart...

1236
01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:50.757
and completely understand,
you know, his emotional state.

1237
01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.051
And it makes it very affecting.

1238
01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:57.931
And here he just goes, again,
from being so emotionally high...

1239
01:06:58.097 --> 01:06:59.599
He's made it back home.

1240
01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:02.936
He doesn't realise he missed the cab,
but he's made it back home.

1241
01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:04.979
And then he gets
this devastating news...

1242
01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:06.940
with evidence, he thinks.

1243
01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:10.777
And then here we're about to see
possibly a digital first? I don't know.

1244
01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:14.989
Not too many crying digital characters
have been done.

1245
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.117
I think it's interesting
to point out is that...

1246
01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:21.496
there are three critical scenes
that take place on that table...

1247
01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:24.707
the photograph table, which
represents all the family members.

1248
01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:28.461
The scene when Stuart comes home
and is introduced to the family.

1249
01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:32.090
The scene when Gina and Hugh
tell him that they want...

1250
01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.967
you know, what's best for him...

1251
01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:37.220
which is to go with the Stouts,
who they think are his parents.

1252
01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:41.015
And then when he comes home and
sees his picture having been cut out...

1253
01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:44.936
and Snowbell tells him that
the Littles don't love him anymore.

1254
01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:48.815
And that was a classic
blue-screen shot here, I think.

1255
01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:53.820
Again, this fit the style of the picture,
which is an older 1940s, 1950s...

1256
01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:57.031
style of moviemaking.
Something we were trying to convey...

1257
01:07:57.198 --> 01:08:00.618
in the, you know, just the approach,
stylistically, to the picture.

1258
01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:02.245
This one I also like very much.

1259
01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:06.958
I think this is a really successful,
little sad walk going away.

1260
01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:08.376
And he sort of goes around.

1261
01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:10.420
There was manipulation
on those leaves...

1262
01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:13.172
so that it appeared
that he stepped on them.

1263
01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:15.341
I think Bill Diaz animated this shot.

1264
01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:18.803
The other challenge was that
when we shot this, Stuart wasn't there.

1265
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.681
And the focus was actually too far
in front of Stuart...

1266
01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:27.395
and we had to really work hard
to get it to look like this.

1267
01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:29.772
Camera fades,
or the scene fades to black...

1268
01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.941
which is a classic end
to a second act.

1269
01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.527
And this begins the third act.

1270
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.863
George waiting...

1271
01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:40.325
hopefully by the phone.

1272
01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:44.871
This was a scene that was written
by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel.

1273
01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:49.917
Again, they were both working
on the script, doing polishes...

1274
01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:53.463
because Night,
who had written the original draft...

1275
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.883
which got the movie green-lit,
had actually been called away.

1276
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.385
He couldn't continue to work
on the film.

1277
01:08:59.552 --> 01:09:01.471
He sold the script
for <i>The Sixth Sense...</i>

1278
01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.057
which he was about to go
into preproduction on...

1279
01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:06.643
early in the process for us.
So we lost Night...

1280
01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:11.022
and then had to bring in other writers
to continue working on the story...

1281
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.024
and on the characters
and the scenes.

1282
01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:16.277
Come on! I think we're getting closer.
I can smell him.

1283
01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:17.904
Sorry, Smokey, that was me.

1284
01:09:18.905 --> 01:09:20.948
- And this is just some of...
- The cats?

1285
01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:22.742
Yeah.

1286
01:09:22.909 --> 01:09:25.411
Speaking of fast cats,
now, it's interesting...

1287
01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:28.247
because most of the shots
of the cats...

1288
01:09:28.414 --> 01:09:30.583
were shot at 30 frames
per second...

1289
01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.960
because the cats tend to move
so quickly.

1290
01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:36.673
So we, in fact, just subtly
slowed down their speed...

1291
01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.716
and this is an example of that.

1292
01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:42.679
Although, at the very beginning
of the sequence...

1293
01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.557
when the cats were running past,
those were at 24 frames a second...

1294
01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:50.103
which is what makes them appear
to be moving so fast.

1295
01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:56.818
And here, this was a tremendously
challenging scene to do...

1296
01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:59.320
because it was all cats and Stuart.

1297
01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.989
And so we had to choreograph
all of this action...

1298
01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:05.118
around this and on this tree...

1299
01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:09.914
to convey the dynamics and
the dramatics of the storytelling.

1300
01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:13.167
You got to get out of here.
This is Central Park. It's dark out.

1301
01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:15.128
There are hungry cats all over.

1302
01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:17.463
- Where are you?
- It's your pal, Monty.

1303
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.132
What's he doing here?

1304
01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.634
- He'll hear you.
- Why shouldn't he hear me?

1305
01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:26.305
Snowbell! Buddy!
What are you doing up there?

1306
01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:29.142
Oh, no. Perfect.

1307
01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:32.145
Hey, you found him. Attaboy!

1308
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.480
Hey, everybody! Over here!

1309
01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.733
The interesting thing story-wise
is that...

1310
01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:40.027
Snowbell, who has hated Stuart
all along...

1311
01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:45.241
is confronted with the circumstance
of being responsible for his death...

1312
01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:47.118
which is, you know, the murder...

1313
01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:50.288
which is a bit too much
for Snowbell to take.

1314
01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:53.875
And what we discover about Snowbell
is that he has a heart.

1315
01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.335
He's not really about killing Stuart...

1316
01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:59.839
so much as he is about
he doesn't want him in the family.

1317
01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:03.509
He doesn't want him to have a position
in the family above his.

1318
01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:08.681
So, of course, his jealousy leads him,
you know, to this...

1319
01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:12.685
you know, to Smokey
and putting this whole plan in motion.

1320
01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.604
When he's confronted with the idea...

1321
01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:19.692
of actually physically throwing Stuart
to the other cats...

1322
01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:22.695
Of course, you know what cats do
with mice. They eat them.

1323
01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:25.406
It's sort of too much
for Snowbell to take...

1324
01:11:25.573 --> 01:11:27.950
and so he has
a huge change of heart here...

1325
01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.870
where he attempts to rescue Stuart.

1326
01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:35.416
The other cats at this point think
he just wants to eat him all himself...

1327
01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.502
which is pretty funny.

1328
01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:40.463
And all this material,
we actually built the tree...

1329
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.882
in two giant pieces...

1330
01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:47.386
because we couldn't really put
the cats up so high...

1331
01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:51.140
because we had to have a huge
number of trainers up around the tree.

1332
01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:55.061
So when we shot some of these scenes,
when there are cats up in the tree...

1333
01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.230
we'd have them surrounded
by trainers...

1334
01:11:57.396 --> 01:12:02.568
who were all harnessed to
safety rigs to keep them up in the air.

1335
01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.403
And it was just so challenging...

1336
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.114
to get the cats to do
what we needed them to do.

1337
01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:10.117
Particularly this scene
where we needed Snowbell to react...

1338
01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:11.994
as if Stuart's hugging his leg...

1339
01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:16.999
and do this sort of sidelong glance,
this Jack Benny take.

1340
01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.585
And the way we got the cat
to do it was...

1341
01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:23.130
they would take the light stick
to get the cat's attention...

1342
01:12:23.297 --> 01:12:25.842
and then move it
and then they turned the light off.

1343
01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:30.054
And we actually hit upon that idea
as we were shooting the scene.

1344
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:33.599
The other thing is, when we shot
a lot of this material up in the tree...

1345
01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.977
because of the nature
of getting these takes...

1346
01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:39.647
we would just literally shoot
an entire magazine of film...

1347
01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:41.732
to do one take.

1348
01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:45.111
So we'd set up the camera and shoot
and go through this action...

1349
01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:47.238
and I'd be yelling at the trainers:

1350
01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:50.283
"Get the cat to look left!
Get him to look up! Look down!"

1351
01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:53.786
Until we could get enough moments
of expression and attitude...

1352
01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:56.956
that would convey these moments
so you'd believe these cats...

1353
01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:59.333
were really doing these things.

1354
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.044
That scene of Monty,
where he laughs...

1355
01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:05.298
was something we came up with
on the spur of the moment...

1356
01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:08.384
because we couldn't get him
to do just this head bob...

1357
01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.137
necessary to make him look
like he was laughing.

1358
01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:14.473
So I had actually seen at one time
in the rehearsals...

1359
01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.144
the trainer feed the cat,
and when this particular cat ate...

1360
01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:21.647
he did this weird jerky head move
which looked like he was laughing.

1361
01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.400
When we were doing the shot,
I said, "Feed the cat!"

1362
01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:27.111
They did it and the cat looked like
he was laughing.

1363
01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:30.156
- Maybe "family" is too strong a word.
- Scratch them both.

1364
01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:34.785
One of the most critical things about
successfully achieving this illusion...

1365
01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:38.581
where a character is believably,
you know, acting...

1366
01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:42.001
and moving in an environment,
a live-action environment...

1367
01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:45.296
is how the character interacts
with physical objects.

1368
01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:48.507
So you'll notice as Stuart
is swinging through...

1369
01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:51.010
Across the branch,
holding onto the collar...

1370
01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:54.513
that the leaves are moving,
that the collar is moving.

1371
01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.183
Some of the shots of the collar
are of a real collar...

1372
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:59.143
that was puppeted on the set.

1373
01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:03.022
And a couple of the shots of the collar
were created as a CGI element.

1374
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:06.233
- So it's a digital collar.
- If we went back and did it again...

1375
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.403
I think I would have done
digital collar on every shot...

1376
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:12.198
because it's just the interaction
with the...

1377
01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:15.451
It's great to put the interaction in there
and we could add that...

1378
01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:18.245
and then put in the digital collar
over the top of it.

1379
01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:21.207
Once we were able to add
the digital collar...

1380
01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.876
it gave us a lot more flexibility.

1381
01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:26.379
And just as a general
rule of thumb...

1382
01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.548
I really like adding digital props
as much as I can...

1383
01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:33.386
because then the character sort of
is the primary focus of the shot.

1384
01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:37.682
We don't have to worry about timing
the character to match a physical prop.

1385
01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:41.268
Lowering this branch is one thing.
This is great to do with a physical...

1386
01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:44.438
The actual branch on the set
and we're matched up to it.

1387
01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:48.067
But with things that Stuart hits
or bumps into or carries...

1388
01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:50.653
it's much better to do those
as a digital prop...

1389
01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:55.116
because then Stuart's timing,
Stuart's acting drives the props.

1390
01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:56.909
See that little slip there?

1391
01:14:57.076 --> 01:15:00.746
There's a technique in computer
graphics with a character...

1392
01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.623
which is called parenting...

1393
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:05.001
where you can attach
one object to another.

1394
01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.254
And normally, Stuart's hierarchy
of the way he's animated...

1395
01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:11.924
his is from the bottom up,
so that he sticks to the ground.

1396
01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:16.512
But in these shots, we had to go in and
reverse a lot of the ordering on Stuart...

1397
01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:21.100
so he went from the top down so that
his hands would stick to the branch.

1398
01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:25.938
That acting on Monty back there
was really good too. His faces.

1399
01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:28.983
We actually were able to raise
and lower that branch...

1400
01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:33.154
which made the cats a little nervous.
But no cats were harmed in this.

1401
01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.532
In fact, the cats didn't fall in the water.
Those were puppeted cats.

1402
01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:37.742
Those were dummy cats.

1403
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:41.078
But these cats were literally carried
into the water...

1404
01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:43.122
by the trainers and then released...

1405
01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:46.125
so that they would actually
be able to climb out.

1406
01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:51.422
And there was a buzzer going on.
That was another technique they used.

1407
01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.883
They would buzzer the cats
to a location...

1408
01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.468
where they would feed them.

1409
01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:59.346
And food is actually
how you pay a cat.

1410
01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:02.016
So all of these cats
are working for scale.

1411
01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:04.643
They're doing what they do...

1412
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:08.898
because they get to eat,
you know, basically.

1413
01:16:09.065 --> 01:16:12.401
If they...

1414
01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:16.030
don't finish the amount of food
that's allocated for them...

1415
01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:19.325
because there's a certain amount
that they get every day...

1416
01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:22.078
if they don't finish it
doing their work...

1417
01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:26.332
the trainers give them the balance
of the food once the cats are finished.

1418
01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.709
The trainers are very sensitive
about that...

1419
01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:31.670
because they wanna make sure
the cats aren't overworked...

1420
01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:34.507
or, you know, once the cats
basically get burned out...

1421
01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.675
just like people do...

1422
01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.844
they need a break
the rest of the day.

1423
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:41.347
When Smokey got hit in the face
with that branch...

1424
01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:44.183
he also never actually got hit
with that branch.

1425
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:45.684
That was composited.

1426
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:48.854
It was done with a little canister
of compressed air...

1427
01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:51.232
that we blew on the cat's face.

1428
01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:56.153
And then later, we shot the branch
swinging towards a blue screen.

1429
01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.032
Then we composited those elements
to make it look like he gets hit.

1430
01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:02.618
So Boone didn't actually hit the cat?

1431
01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:05.371
- No. No cat hitting.
- No cat hitting allowed.

1432
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.498
This was a fun shot to animate...

1433
01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:09.750
with Stuart stuck
on the back of the cat.

1434
01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.627
Stuck.

1435
01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:15.673
- That one really is stuck.
- He's actually a puppet in this shot.

1436
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.300
That's a puppet.
The other one was a digital Stuart.

1437
01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.637
- Yeah. And in the one coming up too.
- I love this shot.

1438
01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:25.891
And the way he slides off here.
That's nice.

1439
01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:27.893
Don't mention it. Ever.

1440
01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:30.521
See that? Even though his face
is away from you...

1441
01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:34.567
you could see his cheeks puffed out
when he smiled and just how...

1442
01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:37.403
His warm feelings
toward Snowbell now.

1443
01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.075
And here we are.
He's back home and it's nice.

1444
01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:47.580
Stuart's just savouring the moment.
He's happy to be home.

1445
01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:55.296
This was, again, a scene that was
written in the original script.

1446
01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:57.423
And when it came time to shooting...

1447
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:59.884
it was complicated by the fact
on one set...

1448
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:03.596
you could look into the Littles' house
and the other you could look out...

1449
01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:05.598
because the big street...

1450
01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:09.185
wasn't actually built on the same set
as the interior of the house.

1451
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.979
So we were limited in some sense...

1452
01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.316
to what we could shoot,
based on those two circumstances.

1453
01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:19.320
So these shots of Stuart looking
in this direction were shot on one set.

1454
01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:22.489
And then the shots of the Littles
were shot on a different set...

1455
01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:24.116
at a different time.

1456
01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.076
What's the matter?

1457
01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:29.788
And here Stuart gets his last
close-up in the movie.

1458
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:35.794
It was actually funny because
the laser pointer was being used...

1459
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:38.964
to point out Stuart so everybody
would look in the same place.

1460
01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:42.843
But you'll notice that Snowbell
is really riveted to where Stuart is...

1461
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.387
because he was really focused
on that laser dot.

1462
01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.473
- He was waiting to get paid.
- Exactly.

1463
01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:58.108
- Here we have the end to the movie.
- There it is, our animated "the end."

1464
01:18:59.193 --> 01:19:01.028
- And then?
- But wait, there's more!

1465
01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.155
That's right.

1466
01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.200
This actually was a scene
that was conceived...

1467
01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:10.079
as a scene to express the bonding
between George and Stuart.

1468
01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:13.749
But we could never quite make it work
in the middle of the film.

1469
01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:18.379
So we ended up deciding that we would
use this at the end of the picture...

1470
01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:20.673
really as a finale to the movie.

1471
01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:23.342
And to give the audience
something extra.

1472
01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:28.055
It was a long road,
and it's amazing at this point to see...

1473
01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:31.892
how so many disparate elements
can be pulled together...

1474
01:19:32.059 --> 01:19:35.020
and appear to have come
fully formed.

1475
01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:39.858
It took the labour of so many
incredible, talented artists.

1476
01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:43.779
Not only the artists who shot
the live-action portion of the film...

1477
01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:47.866
but all the animation artists
and digital artists and everyone.

1478
01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:52.037
And you really feel that the sum total
of all of that work...

1479
01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:54.915
came together to create,
you know...

1480
01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:58.669
what is hopefully a new character
that will, you know...

1481
01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:00.504
be loved by millions.

1482
01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:03.299
Well, certainly by the two people
in this room.

1483
01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:06.677
But it was great to actually be able
to work on...

1484
01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:10.389
For me, to be able to work on
one character for almost 500 shots.

1485
01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:13.392
You really get to develop that character
and I think we...

1486
01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:16.395
We really... Speaking for myself
and the animation team...

1487
01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:20.149
we really were able to sink our teeth
into that and really develop Stuart.

1488
01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:25.070
And as we talked about, Rob,
I think there's a whole new genre...

1489
01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:27.906
of filmmaking out there
that is not very explored...

1490
01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:32.494
which is these digital, realistic,
believable characters with live action.

1491
01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:36.290
Yeah, I think that <i>Stuart Little</i>
represents one further step...

1492
01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:38.709
into a kind of fantasy filmmaking...

1493
01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:41.628
which I think we'll be seeing more of
in the near future.

1494
01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:43.672
- And that's very exciting.
- Nudge, nudge.

1495
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.424
Wink, wink.
