1
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.723
I am a stone.

2
00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.852
I do not move.

3
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:53.196
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth.

4
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.324
Then he won't see my breath.

5
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.083
I take my time.

6
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:11.714
I let him come closer.
I have only one bullet.

7
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.346
I aim at his eye very gently.
My finger presses on the trigger.

8
00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.435
I do not tremble.

9
00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.731
I have no fear.

10
00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.526
I'm a big boy now.

11
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.824
Ready, Vassili?

12
00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.993
Now, Vassili. Fire!

13
00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:44.121
Fire, Vassili! Fire!

14
00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.434
Come on, pick your feet up.

15
00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:49.478
Get on your feet.
Prepare to board the train.

16
00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.449
You there, come along with me now.
This way, pal.

17
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:06.621
All civilians, get out!

18
00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:08.831
Make way, let the civilians off.

19
00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:11.250
This is a military convoy.

20
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.380
No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.

21
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:23.721
This is a convoy to Stalingrad.
Only for the soldiers of the Red Army.

22
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:35.107
No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.

23
00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:47.036
All aboard!

24
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:15.189
Autumn, 1942.

25
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.693
Europe lies crushed
beneath the Nazi jackboot.

26
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.032
The German Third Reich
is at the height of its power.

27
00:05:26.243 --> 00:05:28.911
Hitler's armies are charging
through the heart of the Soviet Union

28
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:30.579
towards the oil fields of Asia.

29
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.041
One last obstacle remains.

30
00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:37.461
A city on the Volga where
the fate of the world is being decided.

31
00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:38.963
Stalingrad.

32
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.615
The Red Army and all citizens
of the Soviet Union

33
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.996
must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
Must fight to the last...

34
00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:34.935
Glorious Comrade Stalin has ordered
not another step backwards,

35
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.731
so the people of the Soviet Union
shall be free.

36
00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:58.292
Let's go forwards, Comrades.
Not a step backwards.

37
00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:21.816
Listen to these letters sent by Russian
mothers to their sons on the front.

38
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:28.030
Volodya, our child,
I know that it is for our motherland...

39
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:35.788
I know it is for our motherland
that you are giving your life.

40
00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:56.058
Everyone here knows
that you will not fall back.

41
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.395
Everyone here is proud of you.

42
00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:03.941
Your father is dead.
Your brothers are dead.

43
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.861
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists.

44
00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.944
Nobody move! Stay on the boat!

45
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.531
Get back or I'll shoot.
Get back from the rails or we'll shoot.

46
00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:56.285
Shoot the traitors!

47
00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:19.141
Prepare to disembark!

48
00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:30.986
Come on, come on! Move!

49
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.618
Come on, Comrades. Come on!

50
00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.039
Move or you'll be shot!

51
00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.765
Over here, stretcher.

52
00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:10.901
- The one with the rifle shoots.
- One out of two gets a rifle.

53
00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:17.449
The one without follows him.
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

54
00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:23.414
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

55
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:27.626
The one with the rifle shoots.

56
00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:31.505
The one without follows him.

57
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:35.342
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

58
00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:40.639
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

59
00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.226
The one with the rifle shoots.

60
00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:14.298
Soldiers of the glorious Red Army,

61
00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:19.219
from now on,
it is either victory or death.

62
00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.889
- Those who retreat...
- I need a rifle.

63
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.682
- ... Will be shot.
- I need a rifle.

64
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:28.270
There will be no mercy
for cowards and traitors.

65
00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:21.133
It's hopeless, Comrades. Get back.

66
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.928
Fall back! Fall back!

67
00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:28.515
It's no good. Get back. Get back.

68
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:36.356
In the name of the Soviet Union,
not a step backwards, or we shoot!

69
00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:40.819
- No retreat. Not a step back.
- No mercy.

70
00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:42.696
Deserters will be shot.

71
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.281
- Fire!
- Fire!

72
00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.539
No mercy for cowards.

73
00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.787
Russians, surrender.

74
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:36.542
You will see your home again.
This is not your war.

75
00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:41.880
Join your German comrades.
They understand your suffering

76
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:45.759
and will care more for you
than your own officers,

77
00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:52.015
who are only sending you to your death.
The Third Reich is not your enemy.

78
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.895
The enemy is bloodthirsty Stalin
and his Bolshevik gang...

79
00:15:23.089 --> 00:15:24.506
Fire!

80
00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:26.044
You'll get us caught,
Comrade Commissar.

81
00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.528
With your permission,
Comrade Commissar.

82
00:18:23.978 --> 00:18:26.062
Which one do you think
I should I aim at first?

83
00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:29.441
You should wait till there's an explosion.

84
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.791
- Do you know how to shoot?
- A little.

85
00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.691
Damn!

86
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.553
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.

87
00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:48.163
Thank you, Comrade Commissar.

88
00:20:54.754 --> 00:21:01.635
Danilov. Political officer,
second class, 21 st infantry.

89
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.282
Vassili Zaitsev.

90
00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:30.121
On this day, September 20th, 1942,
a young shepherd boy from the Urals

91
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.213
arrived in the city of Stalingrad
on the banks of the Volga.

92
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:41.049
His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

93
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:47.555
Like thousands before him, he came
to answer Comrade Stalin's call.

94
00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:52.560
Armed only with a rifle, he quickly
made the fascist invader realize

95
00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:57.899
that from now on he would be punished
for every step he took in the motherland,

96
00:21:58.025 --> 00:22:00.735
that from here on
the only way was back.

97
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.032
What do you think?

98
00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.704
I think Comrade Commissar
has been overgenerous.

99
00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:29.180
Let me go!

100
00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:41.359
By order of Comrade Stalin,
no civilian can leave the city.

101
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:44.946
Get back there!

102
00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:46.573
Move back!

103
00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:49.617
Stand away, or we will open fire.

104
00:23:01.047 --> 00:23:02.213
Stand away!

105
00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:04.299
Keep back!

106
00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:07.343
Get back or we shoot.

107
00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:09.304
Back! Keep back, there!

108
00:23:10.056 --> 00:23:13.558
Make way for Comrade Stalin's envoy.

109
00:23:18.314 --> 00:23:23.151
I carried out my orders.
I sent in all of my boys.

110
00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:26.154
But the Germans engulfed us.

111
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.743
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks.

112
00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:35.830
- And me, what did I have?
- A sacred duty to resist.

113
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:39.084
I have to report to the boss.

114
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:44.339
Perhaps you would prefer
to avoid the red tape.

115
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:13.660
My name is
Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev.

116
00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:18.373
I've come to take things in hand here.

117
00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:25.004
This city is not Kursk,
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

118
00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:29.801
This city is Stalingrad.

119
00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:32.220
Stalingrad!

120
00:24:33.848 --> 00:24:39.644
This city bears the name of the boss.
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

121
00:24:40.062 --> 00:24:44.399
If the Germans capture this city,

122
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:47.861
the entire country will collapse.

123
00:24:49.488 --> 00:24:55.410
Now, I want our boys
to raise their heads.

124
00:24:56.912 --> 00:25:00.331
I want them to act like they have balls.

125
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:03.960
I want them to stop shitting their pants.

126
00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:09.591
That's your job.

127
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:16.598
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.

128
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:23.062
You, what's your suggestion?

129
00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:28.985
Shoot all the other generals who have
retreated and their chiefs of staff, too.

130
00:25:29.904 --> 00:25:33.656
Make some examples.
Deport the families of the deserters...

131
00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.909
That's all been done.

132
00:25:35.993 --> 00:25:37.619
Give them hope.

133
00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:54.385
Here, the men's only choice
is between German bullets and ours.

134
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.680
But there's another way,
a way of courage.

135
00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.099
A way of love of the motherland.

136
00:26:00.184 --> 00:26:03.436
We must publish the army newspaper
again, we must tell magnificent stories,

137
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.272
stories that exalt sacrifice, bravery.

138
00:26:06.357 --> 00:26:08.775
We must make them believe
in a victory.

139
00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:12.487
We must give them hope, pride,
a desire to fight.

140
00:26:13.948 --> 00:26:15.031
Yes.

141
00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:18.993
We need to make examples,
but examples to follow.

142
00:26:20.162 --> 00:26:24.499
What we need are heroes.

143
00:26:28.504 --> 00:26:31.047
Do you know any heroes around here?

144
00:26:31.465 --> 00:26:34.884
Yes, Comrade. I know one.

145
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.979
That's me. Vassili Zaitsev. That's me.

146
00:26:46.689 --> 00:26:49.816
No, you're not dreaming. It's your name.

147
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:52.360
We made the front page.

148
00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:55.738
They haven't changed a word.

149
00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:59.242
Do you have any idea what this means?

150
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.453
It's not the back page.
It's not the second page.

151
00:27:02.538 --> 00:27:04.872
- It's the front page. The front page!
- Front page.

152
00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:07.000
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere,

153
00:27:07.084 --> 00:27:10.503
in the Caucasus, in the Crimea,
even in the Urals.

154
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.966
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself
will be sitting over breakfast,

155
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.885
reading my words,
memorizing your name.

156
00:27:18.387 --> 00:27:21.389
We're famous, Vassili.
Khrushchev loved the article.

157
00:27:21.515 --> 00:27:23.975
He's promoted me to the general staff

158
00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:26.769
and you to sniper division.

159
00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:31.024
- Well, that's good.
- It's very good.

160
00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:33.026
- It's very good. It's great!
- It's very great!

161
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.277
- It's great!
- It's great!

162
00:27:34.403 --> 00:27:38.114
It's great for both of us
because we did it together. Together.

163
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.199
Well, now, admittedly,
I did all the hard work.

164
00:27:40.284 --> 00:27:41.743
You know, you're very lucky
I can't fight back.

165
00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:43.619
- Why's that?
- Because Khrushchev told me

166
00:27:43.746 --> 00:27:44.954
to make sure nothing happens to you.

167
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.748
- You're too important.
- I'm too valuable.

168
00:27:46.874 --> 00:27:50.043
Yes. Careful of my glasses, please,
they're new.

169
00:27:50.127 --> 00:27:51.586
Sorry, sir.

170
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:55.214
- I'm famous.
- I'm famous.

171
00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:56.841
- We're famous.
- I'm famous.

172
00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:59.177
Vassili, the young shepherd
from the Urals,

173
00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:00.928
killed his 12th German officer today.

174
00:28:01.055 --> 00:28:03.139
Used to hunt wolves,
now he shoots fascists.

175
00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:05.808
- Today Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd...
- One more colonel shot by...

176
00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:07.352
He is an example to us all.

177
00:28:07.436 --> 00:28:09.937
Today Vassili Zaitsev
killed his 32nd general.

178
00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:15.276
...Thirty-sixth German officer...

179
00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:19.572
...the Germans you have killed?
Today Vassili Zaitsev killed...

180
00:28:19.656 --> 00:28:23.785
...eleven dog tags retrieved
by sniper Vassili Zaitsev...

181
00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:29.290
More and more men and women,

182
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.376
fighters from all branches
of our armed forces,

183
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:36.339
volunteer to join the sniper division
and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.

184
00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:42.469
I am a stone.

185
00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:51.813
I breathe slowly.

186
00:28:58.946 --> 00:29:00.988
I aim at the eye.

187
00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:32.812
So it is you.

188
00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:36.023
The great Vassili Zaitsev.

189
00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:39.819
My mother makes the best potatoes
and bacon in town.

190
00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:40.987
Sounds good.

191
00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:44.198
When she sees you,
she won't believe her eyes.

192
00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:48.536
- How many today?
- Only two.

193
00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:52.457
And the last one,
why didn't you shoot him?

194
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:56.878
He was only a foot soldier.
It wasn't worth giving away my position.

195
00:29:58.172 --> 00:29:59.589
Bless you.

196
00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:03.718
We know how much we owe you.

197
00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:06.554
We pray for you every day.

198
00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:11.726
Every evening we listen to them
talk about you on Radio Moscow.

199
00:30:13.103 --> 00:30:14.353
Thanks.

200
00:30:14.605 --> 00:30:16.022
You've certainly managed well
down here.

201
00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:20.026
My parents used to store furniture
down here before the war.

202
00:30:20.736 --> 00:30:23.988
Sacha, drop that right now.

203
00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:25.573
It's loaded.

204
00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:38.127
- This way, Comrade Commissar.
- Thank you, Comrade.

205
00:30:40.714 --> 00:30:42.131
Good evening.

206
00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.470
Comrade Zaitsev.

207
00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:56.103
My God, where does
all this mail come from?

208
00:30:56.939 --> 00:31:00.608
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

209
00:31:01.735 --> 00:31:03.653
This one's from the workers
of the Kuzbass.

210
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:06.447
They want to name their mine
after Vassili.

211
00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:09.116
Right, let's start with the miners.

212
00:31:10.452 --> 00:31:12.662
Come on, let's get to work.

213
00:31:17.668 --> 00:31:20.461
- Dear Comrades from the Kuzbass...
- Kuzbass.

214
00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:23.464
...I thank you for your letter of praise.

215
00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:26.259
- Praise?
- R-A-I-S-E.

216
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:30.638
And

217
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.686
I hope that I can live up
to your expectations.

218
00:31:36.812 --> 00:31:39.522
A- T-I-O-N-S.

219
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:41.524
Expectations.

220
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.988
You're interested in German literature,
Mrs. Filipov?

221
00:31:48.657 --> 00:31:51.325
It's all right. It's our neighbor.

222
00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:53.536
Right. Where were we?

223
00:31:53.662 --> 00:31:57.582
- Tania, we have guests.
- Expectations. Your offer to name...

224
00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:10.011
I recognize you.

225
00:32:12.681 --> 00:32:14.557
It's Vassili Zaitsev.

226
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:22.857
I saw your picture in the paper.
Thank you for everything you're doing.

227
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:27.194
- And this is his friend, Commissar...
- Danilov.

228
00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:29.447
Danilov.

229
00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:31.866
Tania's like a daughter to me.

230
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.869
She used to take care of Sacha
when I worked at the factory.

231
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:37.955
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.

232
00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:41.292
- They're yours?
- She studied German at the university.

233
00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:43.544
- Which university?
- Moscow.

234
00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:50.635
Moscow.

235
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:58.476
- Shouldn't we...
- Yes, let's continue.

236
00:33:00.312 --> 00:33:05.107
Your offer to name your mine
after me is

237
00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:08.444
a great honor.

238
00:33:10.072 --> 00:33:12.990
H- O-N.

239
00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:16.994
- Yes, I know, honor.
- Very good.

240
00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:23.292
Shouldn't we try and make the point
that I'm not the only one fighting?

241
00:33:25.462 --> 00:33:28.547
That's an excellent idea, Vassili.
Excellent.

242
00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:32.176
We can take it even further, though.
Yeah, we can take it further.

243
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:39.266
Your battle for the production of coal
is as worthy as mine.

244
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:44.438
There's no "K" in coal.

245
00:33:45.273 --> 00:33:47.441
Just one "I."

246
00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:49.527
That's it.

247
00:33:50.112 --> 00:33:52.571
Tell me if I'm going too fast.

248
00:33:52.656 --> 00:33:54.657
- No, you're not going too fast.
- Are you sure?

249
00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:57.785
I just thought...
Is there any other improvements?

250
00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:02.039
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

251
00:34:02.124 --> 00:34:06.043
We should carry on. We're not tired.
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov.

252
00:34:06.128 --> 00:34:09.797
These people took the trouble
to write to us.

253
00:34:11.007 --> 00:34:13.884
Tomorrow, we may not be around
to write back.

254
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.776
I was expecting someone else.

255
00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:58.656
Certainly not someone so prestigious.
I imagine you have your reasons

256
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.409
for getting yourself involved
in this hellish situation.

257
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:10.042
My army is not designed
for this kind of fighting.

258
00:36:10.126 --> 00:36:13.337
Yesterday, yet again,
I had to promote 25 sergeants

259
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:17.132
to replace the officers shot down
by their sharpshooters.

260
00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.345
Those snipers are demoralizing
my people.

261
00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:28.769
This city is no more
than a heap of ruins.

262
00:36:30.772 --> 00:36:33.148
But the Führer's persisting.

263
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:38.028
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

264
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.370
We should trust the Führer's instinct.

265
00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:50.124
He always managed
to lead us to victory.

266
00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:55.504
We shall be back home for Christmas.

267
00:36:59.509 --> 00:37:03.304
How are you going to go about
finding this young Russian?

268
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:07.975
I'll fix it so that he's the one
who finds me.

269
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.522
Vassili! Vassili!

270
00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:16.442
- Come on! Time to get up.
- What?

271
00:37:16.526 --> 00:37:18.152
They have a problem in the
department store sector.

272
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:20.154
They need us. Come on.

273
00:37:29.915 --> 00:37:34.001
Look, Vassili, he's hiding
in the department store, over there.

274
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:44.511
So far this morning, he's knocked off
five officers plus two machine gunners.

275
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:49.350
Look! Third floor.

276
00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:55.439
- Fourth window from the left.
- Fourth window from the left.

277
00:37:59.361 --> 00:38:00.569
See him?

278
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.447
Yeah, I see him.

279
00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:19.213
- There, you got him!
- Great shot.

280
00:38:23.218 --> 00:38:25.302
Let's go get his dog tag.

281
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:31.392
Goodbye, Comrade Commissar.

282
00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:34.436
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mrs. Filipov.

283
00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:45.364
You can borrow whatever you like.

284
00:38:45.448 --> 00:38:48.784
I'm not sure what they would say
to me at headquarters

285
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:52.287
if I came back with an armful
of Goethe and Schiller.

286
00:38:52.414 --> 00:38:54.331
There's some Marx, too.

287
00:38:55.125 --> 00:38:57.835
You were assigned to civil defense
at the 12th district?

288
00:38:57.919 --> 00:38:59.753
No, I volunteered.

289
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:03.048
It's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

290
00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:05.092
Comrade Khrushchev was telling me
just yesterday

291
00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.970
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

292
00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:12.349
I can't. Our militia is responsible for
all the people in this neighborhood.

293
00:39:12.434 --> 00:39:13.642
We're already desperately short of men.

294
00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:14.810
We can take care of that.

295
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:17.062
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for every one that speaks German.

296
00:39:17.147 --> 00:39:18.856
I'd rather stay and fight.

297
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.775
Serving the headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.

298
00:39:24.696 --> 00:39:26.405
You stay here. You cover us.

299
00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:28.365
- All right.
- We go.

300
00:39:31.286 --> 00:39:32.661
Take care.

301
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:39.251
Ludmilla, come on.

302
00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:32.930
Take the stairway.

303
00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:25.500
- It's a trap.
- I know.

304
00:42:51.694 --> 00:42:53.070
Move back.

305
00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:43.954
He's still here.

306
00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:11.857
- They're coming straight for us.
- Ludmilla, stay where you are.

307
00:44:12.734 --> 00:44:13.942
He's over there somewhere.

308
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.498
We have to get out of here!

309
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:33.920
- We have to get out of here!
- Just stay where you are!

310
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.261
- What are we gonna do?
- Ludmilla, stay where you are!

311
00:44:53.358 --> 00:44:55.233
Fuck this, I'm going.

312
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:59.154
Ludmilla, no!

313
00:45:52.834 --> 00:45:54.668
What does this mean?

314
00:45:56.421 --> 00:45:59.339
"A little shepherd from the Urals
receives a new sniper's rifle."

315
00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:04.094
"A Mosin Nagant 7.62,
with its 3.5-power PU telescope,"

316
00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:06.304
"pride of precision of Soviet production."

317
00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:10.434
- I've seen that rifle close up.
- Have you?

318
00:46:10.518 --> 00:46:12.352
I even touched it.

319
00:46:12.812 --> 00:46:15.313
I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

320
00:47:04.906 --> 00:47:07.657
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today.

321
00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:11.912
- And it was my fault.
- No. I'm sure that's not true.

322
00:47:12.038 --> 00:47:14.080
There was a German sniper.

323
00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:17.584
I walked them right into his trap.

324
00:47:18.377 --> 00:47:20.921
- What else can you tell me?
- He didn't relocate.

325
00:47:21.047 --> 00:47:26.051
A sniper who doesn't relocate
isn't normal.

326
00:47:27.553 --> 00:47:29.179
He was very good.

327
00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:32.682
It wasn't just his shooting,
it was his instinct.

328
00:47:33.935 --> 00:47:36.770
He was a step ahead of me all the time.

329
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:39.898
That's because
he knows everything about you.

330
00:47:40.441 --> 00:47:46.947
His name is Konig. Major Konig.
They've sent him here to...

331
00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:50.200
To find you.

332
00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:00.293
At first, we weren't sure
if the information was reliable.

333
00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:03.463
It seems he's come all the way
from Berlin to stop you.

334
00:48:03.548 --> 00:48:04.798
You've caused them
so many sleepless nights,

335
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.132
they've sent their top marksman
after you.

336
00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:10.303
- So, what do we know about him?
- He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

337
00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:15.225
He's director of their sniper school
in Zossen.

338
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:18.728
Koulikov studied under him
at Zossen before the war.

339
00:48:18.813 --> 00:48:22.983
He knows all his tricks. From now on
he'll go with you everywhere.

340
00:48:24.318 --> 00:48:27.320
A nobleman from Bavaria
who hunts deer

341
00:48:27.405 --> 00:48:30.657
against the shepherd boy from the Urals
who poaches wolves.

342
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:34.160
It's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

343
00:48:37.498 --> 00:48:40.083
It's the essence of class struggle.

344
00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:42.669
I'm glad you're so happy.

345
00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:47.257
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

346
00:48:47.842 --> 00:48:50.343
No one shoots like you, Vassili.

347
00:48:59.312 --> 00:49:01.313
She's been transferred.

348
00:49:03.524 --> 00:49:06.610
I'll see if they're ready for you next door.

349
00:49:10.364 --> 00:49:11.448
Hello.

350
00:49:11.532 --> 00:49:14.326
You look very smart
in your new uniform.

351
00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:18.872
Make sure they don't take it back
once you've finished.

352
00:49:18.998 --> 00:49:20.790
They probably will.

353
00:49:24.462 --> 00:49:27.297
I've heard the rumor
about the German.

354
00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:31.885
- And I wanted to wish you luck.
- Thank you. I'll need it.

355
00:49:32.178 --> 00:49:36.014
From what Comrade Danilov tells me,
you're going to win.

356
00:49:42.063 --> 00:49:43.188
It's time.

357
00:49:44.732 --> 00:49:45.815
Vassili?

358
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.693
- Vassili? Vassili?
- Come to my arms.

359
00:49:50.029 --> 00:49:52.864
Look in my direction, here.
Here, Vassili.

360
00:49:54.909 --> 00:49:56.660
Put your cap back on.
You'll look more heroic.

361
00:49:56.744 --> 00:49:59.162
- This way, Comrade Zaitsev.
- I love this little fellow.

362
00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:01.581
Vassili, is it true that
you volunteered for the front?

363
00:50:01.707 --> 00:50:02.916
- Vassili?
- Vassili?

364
00:50:03.042 --> 00:50:04.084
How old are you, Vassili?

365
00:50:04.168 --> 00:50:05.919
Do you know what this duel
means for our country?

366
00:50:06.003 --> 00:50:08.004
Is it true you killed your first wolf
when you were five?

367
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:09.923
Vassili, tell us, how many fascists
have you killed today?

368
00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:12.258
Are you proud to be challenged
by the best sharpshooter in Germany?

369
00:50:12.385 --> 00:50:15.261
It's a sign the Germans
are starting to shit their pants.

370
00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:18.431
Go on, my boy, tell us
how are you going to deal with him?

371
00:50:18.516 --> 00:50:20.350
- Or rather, no.
- One more question, please.

372
00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:22.352
Tell it to the boss.

373
00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:25.063
He likes good hunting stories.

374
00:50:31.112 --> 00:50:35.240
Look at him with pride,
because he's looking at you.

375
00:50:36.742 --> 00:50:39.369
The whole country is looking at you.

376
00:51:02.143 --> 00:51:05.770
Forgive me, forgive me, Grandfather.

377
00:51:38.471 --> 00:51:43.183
So it's not the wolf that chooses
the hunting ground, but the hunter.

378
00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:50.607
And I'm sure your grandfather
taught you that.

379
00:51:54.445 --> 00:51:58.114
Except, in this case, I'm the game.

380
00:52:03.162 --> 00:52:08.291
However, today what we're going to do
is lure the wolf out of his lair

381
00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:10.502
to where we want him to be.

382
00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:53.753
You're the one whose life is valuable,
you go first.

383
00:52:53.838 --> 00:52:55.922
No. No. We take it in turns.

384
00:52:56.048 --> 00:53:00.218
Next time it's your turn to go first.
And then it's you, Volodya.

385
00:53:16.277 --> 00:53:17.944
Son of a bitch!

386
00:53:22.575 --> 00:53:27.453
These are new pants. I just took them
off a captain from the 251 st yesterday.

387
00:53:32.293 --> 00:53:36.212
Sixteen months I spent in Germany
at the school in Zossen.

388
00:53:36.297 --> 00:53:40.133
Of course, those were the days
when we were friends with the Krauts.

389
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:45.638
When our Joseph and their Adolf
were walking hand in hand.

390
00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:51.436
From here to the wire,
160 meters, right?

391
00:53:57.318 --> 00:54:00.236
- Hundred and fifty-five.
- Whatever.

392
00:54:00.321 --> 00:54:03.239
That'll make them send out a repair guy.

393
00:54:03.824 --> 00:54:05.408
Let's relocate.

394
00:54:26.847 --> 00:54:28.097
Hey, Volodya.

395
00:54:38.859 --> 00:54:43.613
After the Germans invaded us, it wasn't
the same atmosphere any more.

396
00:54:45.658 --> 00:54:47.951
They threw my arse in prison.

397
00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:51.204
"What were you doing in Germany?"

398
00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:55.541
"Excuse me," says I, "but it was
Comrade Stalin who sent me there."

399
00:54:56.126 --> 00:55:00.046
"Don't bring our glorious leader
into your treachery."

400
00:55:00.714 --> 00:55:03.883
"Confess, spy bastard, confess."

401
00:55:03.968 --> 00:55:07.553
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

402
00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:14.978
Well, there wasn't a sickle,
but there was a hammer.

403
00:55:15.062 --> 00:55:18.731
And bang, it knocked out all my teeth.

404
00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:25.071
That's right, boy, have no illusions.

405
00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:28.908
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

406
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.039
Hey, it's your repair guy.

407
00:55:37.543 --> 00:55:38.918
I got him.

408
00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:57.520
- It's about soup time, isn't it?
- I'm going.

409
00:55:57.938 --> 00:56:00.940
Well, get a move on, Volodya.

410
00:56:01.025 --> 00:56:05.028
And try not to spill it all
on your way back, you Marxist bastard.

411
00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:20.376
Here's the enemy sniper activity

412
00:56:20.461 --> 00:56:22.628
reported during
the past 24 hours, Major.

413
00:56:26.341 --> 00:56:29.010
Two sentries shot
in the train station sector,

414
00:56:29.136 --> 00:56:31.846
one artillery observer
in the northern sector,

415
00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:35.933
one lieutenant from the 24th panzer
division in the factory sector,

416
00:56:36.018 --> 00:56:39.103
three telephone repair men
in the workers' housing sector.

417
00:56:39.188 --> 00:56:43.483
They also tell me we've just taken
a prisoner who may interest you.

418
00:56:43.859 --> 00:56:47.153
- I hope he's still able to speak.
- Excuse me, sir?

419
00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:49.906
Nothing. Thank you.

420
00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:54.994
So tell us, Volodya.

421
00:56:55.996 --> 00:56:57.997
Which building is he in?

422
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:03.169
There is no way I know that.

423
00:57:04.838 --> 00:57:07.298
He moves around all the time.

424
00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:11.469
- He jumps from one to the next.
- On which floor?

425
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:15.848
- I don't know.
- We'll see about that.

426
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:18.768
Undress him.

427
00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:22.355
Put him in one of our uniforms.

428
00:57:50.676 --> 00:57:52.885
You see? They're stubborn.

429
00:57:54.179 --> 00:57:57.140
That's the good thing
about the Germans.

430
00:57:57.224 --> 00:58:01.227
Man, you got to admit,
when they get an idea in their heads...

431
00:58:16.618 --> 00:58:17.785
Right.

432
00:58:18.787 --> 00:58:22.707
- Let's see if our customer has arrived.
- You ready?

433
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:29.964
And now, our famous shepherd
from the Urals

434
00:58:30.048 --> 00:58:35.344
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot, gets
up to make sure he has hit his target.

435
00:58:36.013 --> 00:58:37.889
Major Konig sees him,

436
00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.061
aims for his helmet,

437
00:58:44.813 --> 00:58:48.524
fires, reveals his position,

438
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:50.943
and is shot in turn.

439
00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:05.499
Except Major Konig doesn't fire,

440
00:59:09.713 --> 00:59:11.923
because Major Konig isn't there.

441
00:59:16.178 --> 00:59:17.470
Koulikov?

442
00:59:23.894 --> 00:59:27.188
Don't you think that was strange?
That last one?

443
00:59:27.564 --> 00:59:30.733
They sent him out
to get shot like the others.

444
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:32.777
It's not natural.

445
00:59:32.861 --> 00:59:35.947
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

446
00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:40.993
No. No, I'm the one who was stupid.

447
00:59:41.745 --> 00:59:44.080
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

448
00:59:44.164 --> 00:59:46.624
I mean, it's like us with the Ukrainians.

449
00:59:46.708 --> 00:59:50.461
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead grunts.

450
00:59:50.545 --> 00:59:54.465
Tomorrow, we'll kill us some generals.

451
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.476
Whose turn is it?

452
01:00:06.687 --> 01:00:08.229
Mine, I think.

453
01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.941
You're such a cheater.

454
01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:18.864
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.
No, no, no. It's my turn to go first.

455
01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.329
And it's your turn
to get a hole in your breeches.

456
01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.365
To victory.

457
01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:53.793
This sniper business
has been dragging on too long.

458
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.797
What's that little fellow of yours up to?

459
01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:02.218
He's probing, Comrade Khrushchev.

460
01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.637
He's testing the German
for weaknesses.

461
01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:07.306
He's meticulous in his preparation.

462
01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:13.270
Vodka is a luxury we have.

463
01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:17.650
Caviar is a luxury we have.

464
01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:19.443
Time is not.

465
01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:24.073
He's aware of that,
Comrade Khrushchev, we both are.

466
01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.160
I assure you he will succeed.

467
01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:33.499
Good. It seems your destinies
are entwined.

468
01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:58.023
They're keeping you busy?

469
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.991
I picked this up from the kitchen.
It's from the reception the other day.

470
01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:09.702
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

471
01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.540
She'll be thrilled.
That's very sweet of you.

472
01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:17.376
There's plenty more if you're hungry.

473
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.254
You're Jewish, aren't you?

474
01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:24.967
There's nothing in our religion
that says you can't eat sturgeon.

475
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.054
My father had a premonition
all this would happen.

476
01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:31.474
You mean the war?

477
01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.436
He understood
that the hatred of the Jews ran deep.

478
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:39.148
He was saving up
to buy some land in Palestine.

479
01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:43.819
He said it was the only land
that we truly belonged in.

480
01:03:44.613 --> 01:03:47.323
The only land we had a duty to defend.

481
01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:51.243
He insisted I learn to use a rifle.

482
01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.413
I learn to shoot.

483
01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:02.963
I know that in times of war
personal feelings should be put aside,

484
01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:08.177
- but I have a favor to ask you.
- Of course. Anything you want.

485
01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:10.804
I want to be reassigned.

486
01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.768
What's happened, Tania?

487
01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:42.503
He shot him.

488
01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:49.510
He shot him even though
he jumped first.

489
01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:53.055
Shot him on the run.

490
01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:57.643
It was an impossible shot.
I've never seen anything like it.

491
01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:01.480
You've promised people
a victory I can't deliver.

492
01:05:03.483 --> 01:05:06.026
I don't stand a chance against this man.

493
01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:08.737
You mustn't talk like that, Vassili.

494
01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:13.576
What if I told you we've found
a way to track his movements?

495
01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.869
We've got someone, Vassili.

496
01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:18.914
Someone close to him
passing us information.

497
01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:22.001
Next time you will be
one step ahead of him.

498
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.588
I promise.

499
01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.100
Now I have a favor to ask.

500
01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.519
From me?

501
01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:45.733
It's about Tania.

502
01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.698
Come in.

503
01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.372
He doesn't even know you exist,

504
01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:04.043
but at that moment you're closer to him
than anyone else on Earth.

505
01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:06.712
You see his face through the sight.

506
01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:09.757
You see whether
he shaved that morning or not.

507
01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.258
You can see whether he's married by,

508
01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:14.136
you know, whether
he has a wedding ring on.

509
01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:23.020
It's not like just firing at a distant shape.
It's not just a uniform. It's a man's face.

510
01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:26.774
Those faces don't go away.

511
01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:32.446
They come back
and they get replaced by more faces.

512
01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:36.450
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

513
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:40.871
He likes you very much. I think
he'd try anything to change your mind.

514
01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:43.666
Did he tell you why
I asked for the transfer?

515
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.042
No.

516
01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:48.087
This morning a list arrived
at headquarters.

517
01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:51.924
It was a list of civilians
who'd been rounded up

518
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:56.428
and sent to Germany in a convoy
that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

519
01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.641
My parents were amongst them.

520
01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:04.395
After 30 kilometers,

521
01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:10.275
the German soldiers stopped the train
and forced everyone out.

522
01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:16.573
In the middle of a bridge,
they bound them together,

523
01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:19.076
two by two.

524
01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:22.579
Mothers with daughters.

525
01:07:23.123 --> 01:07:24.915
Husbands and wives.

526
01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:30.379
They lined them up against the railing.

527
01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:35.926
And then they fired a single shot
at each pair to save bullets.

528
01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.263
It worked.

529
01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:44.977
The bodies of the ones who died
dragged the others under the water.

530
01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.941
I know they died together.

531
01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:55.446
They would never have let themselves
be separated.

532
01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.505
That's Koulikov's rifle. It's a good rifle.

533
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.641
Thank you.

534
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:59.009
I know how he leaves the shelter.
He goes through the tractor factory.

535
01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.678
The tractor factory is big.

536
01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.433
I know exactly where.

537
01:09:06.518 --> 01:09:10.437
He crawls through a gutter
under a grate where the vats are.

538
01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:13.482
Then he goes out from the workshop.

539
01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.943
In between the two
there's a place where he's in the open.

540
01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.529
It's under a long iron foot walk.

541
01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.857
Good luck, Comrade.

542
01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:43.006
I know exactly
where he's waiting for me.

543
01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:51.223
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.
We'll take him out from behind.

544
01:12:11.202 --> 01:12:15.747
We'll get to the other end of
the workshop through these pipes.

545
01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.041
Follow me.

546
01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:08.527
- You go that way. I'll go around this way.
- Okay.

547
01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:27.587
Shit!

548
01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:38.932
- It's okay.
- You should go back.

549
01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:40.851
- No.
- Go back.

550
01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.811
- I'll be all right.
- No, you go!

551
01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.694
Keep your legs in.

552
01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:37.699
Come on. Come on. Come on.

553
01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:40.762
Comrade Stalin is asking
for one last effort.

554
01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.764
The fate of the motherland is at risk.

555
01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:45.433
The fate of all those
you love and cherish.

556
01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:47.560
It's for them that we fight today.

557
01:16:49.355 --> 01:16:53.483
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans
are throwing everything at us.

558
01:16:53.693 --> 01:16:56.945
If they're lucky, one in ten of these
soldiers will come back alive.

559
01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:59.614
You're highly educated.
You know languages.

560
01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:03.034
Every intercept you translate
saves hundreds of lives.

561
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.038
Every message you decode
kills thousands of theirs.

562
01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:09.457
You have a duty to survive.

563
01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:12.127
Vassili was born to fire a gun.
That's what he knows.

564
01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:15.213
You and I were born
for a different purpose.

565
01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:19.551
If Vassili were here,
he would tell you the same thing.

566
01:17:22.346 --> 01:17:24.681
Where is he? Where's Vassili?

567
01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.209
Keep your head down.

568
01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:36.211
- Tell me where he is.
- Stay into that pipe.

569
01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:39.214
Tania, stay in. Stay in. Get your head in.

570
01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:48.306
Slow down.

571
01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.809
Don't shoot.

572
01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:58.650
He's over there.

573
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:14.833
You see the pillar in front of you?

574
01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.920
I need you to move round behind it.

575
01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.181
Go!

576
01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:37.981
Tania, I need you to find
a large piece of glass.

577
01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:39.941
Piece of glass.

578
01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:45.655
You see the kiln?

579
01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:50.201
Behind me, to the left of the factory.

580
01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:55.331
- Yes? I can't hear you.
- Yes.

581
01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:56.708
Yes.

582
01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:02.422
Do you see the two louvers?

583
01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:04.924
Yes.

584
01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:08.928
Do you see the one
with the broken slat?

585
01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:13.850
- Yes.
- This is what I want you to do.

586
01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:23.735
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

587
01:20:24.695 --> 01:20:27.447
Three, two, one.

588
01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:48.718
Hello, Sacha.

589
01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:58.394
He was right where you said he'd be.

590
01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:00.772
Nearly there.

591
01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.486
He's very clever.

592
01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:13.493
Tell me about him.

593
01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:24.921
Why was it his grandfather who taught
him how to shoot and not his father?

594
01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:27.590
His father's dead. His mother, too.

595
01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:35.306
- Does he talk about his father?
- No, he didn't know him.

596
01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:39.978
Did he go to school?

597
01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:43.606
He knows how to write.
He answers lots of letters.

598
01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:49.153
- Is it girls who write to him?
- Everyone writes to him.

599
01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:51.781
And is there a girl
he loves in his village?

600
01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:55.451
- Not in his village. Here!
- Does she love him?

601
01:21:55.995 --> 01:21:59.539
Yes. Because he's handsome,
because he's brave.

602
01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:01.874
And she's very beautiful.

603
01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:04.127
I know her well.
She's from my neighborhood.

604
01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:07.755
She went to the university.
They are handsome together.

605
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.633
Later the two of them will get married.

606
01:22:15.723 --> 01:22:17.682
At least, I think so.

607
01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:24.981
And you, Sacha,
why are you helping the Germans?

608
01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:32.614
Because they're stronger.
Because they're going to win the war.

609
01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:35.033
And because you like chocolate.

610
01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:55.053
All these people here
know they're gonna die,

611
01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:59.682
so each night
when they make it back, it's a bonus.

612
01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.727
Excuse me!

613
01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:07.774
So every cup of tea, every cigarette,

614
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:11.778
becomes a little celebration.

615
01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:15.239
Because for a lot of us,
it may be our last night.

616
01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:19.577
It's just something
you have to accept here.

617
01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.081
Everyone has their time.

618
01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:30.755
In the forest,
the wolf lives for three years,

619
01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:33.257
the donkey for nine.

620
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:39.972
Sorry, but that's got to be
a proverb from the Urals.

621
01:23:40.099 --> 01:23:42.100
It makes no sense to me whatsoever!

622
01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:45.478
The donkey lives longer
because he's more useful.

623
01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.480
It makes absolute sense.

624
01:23:47.606 --> 01:23:51.317
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.
You made it up.

625
01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:54.487
So,

626
01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.865
I'm a donkey.

627
01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:06.249
People like you and Danilov
have to survive this.

628
01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:09.293
People who've read books,
had an education.

629
01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:15.508
- We'll need you when the war's over.
- And if you survive?

630
01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:19.971
What will the useless
Vassili Zaitsev do then?

631
01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:22.974
I want to work in a factory.

632
01:24:23.976 --> 01:24:26.811
My granddad took me to a factory once.

633
01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:34.318
There was this man there
high up on a foot walk.

634
01:24:35.821 --> 01:24:38.573
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

635
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:42.368
The people he was supervising over,
they didn't really understand

636
01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:45.371
what they were doing,
but for him up there

637
01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:48.291
it was simple, it was clear.

638
01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:53.671
And I thought,
"One day, I could be that man."

639
01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:02.346
Sad to have a dream
you know won't happen.

640
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.350
Why shouldn't it?

641
01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:10.897
You'll outlive us all.

642
01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:15.902
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

643
01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:35.880
One hundred and fifty meters stand
between the Germans and the Volga.

644
01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.882
Today the whole world is watching
these 150 meters.

645
01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:41.636
They are
what make Stalingrad the capital

646
01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:45.056
of the war.

647
01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:52.230
Your friend, Tania.

648
01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:56.234
Have you seen her?

649
01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:59.487
She stays over there now
with the snipers.

650
01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:02.365
Tell the major we're sending in
all our sharpshooters

651
01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:05.117
to support the attack on the factory.

652
01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:10.790
Tell him Vassili will be there.

653
01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:03.856
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

654
01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:10.029
Danilov.

655
01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:25.753
You have to stop writing about me.

656
01:30:29.174 --> 01:30:31.842
I'm not gonna get him
because I'm not good enough.

657
01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:35.554
Sooner or later he's gonna find me,
he's gonna kill me.

658
01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:38.724
I've warned you before
not to talk like this.

659
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:42.394
This time it's different.

660
01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:50.277
You've built me up and up
into someone I'm not.

661
01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:55.741
I can't carry that weight any more.
I want to fight.

662
01:30:56.701 --> 01:31:00.454
I want to fight just as a regular soldier.

663
01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:03.207
I understand.

664
01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:05.709
The thing is, Vassili,
you're not a regular soldier,

665
01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:09.588
- you're an extraordinary soldier.
- No. I'm what you've made me.

666
01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:12.591
Nothing more.

667
01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:20.391
Why are you telling me this now?

668
01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:23.102
What's happened?

669
01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:28.691
What's changed?

670
01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:35.781
Did you speak to Tania for me?

671
01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:39.326
Yes.

672
01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:42.204
Well, will she reconsider?

673
01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:47.501
I don't know.

674
01:31:50.881 --> 01:31:54.133
She should. She'll be much safer.
She should. You know that.

675
01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:55.259
Yeah.

676
01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:58.220
It'll be easier to get her reassigned
than you.

677
01:31:58.305 --> 01:32:01.015
You see, the Germans are preparing
another offensive in the city centre.

678
01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:03.267
The propaganda battle's crucial
for morale.

679
01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:06.562
We need you more than ever.
Sacha? Hold on. Sacha?

680
01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:14.486
- Tell him what you know, Sacha.
- Hello, Sacha.

681
01:32:14.571 --> 01:32:16.447
There was dust on the major's boots.

682
01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:20.618
Sacha has the major convinced
he's gone over to the other side.

683
01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:23.996
I don't need to tell you
the risks he's taking.

684
01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.372
The dust was yellow.

685
01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:27.708
There's only one place
where there's dust like that.

686
01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:31.962
In the back of the chemical factory,
a big heap along the tracks.

687
01:32:33.924 --> 01:32:35.257
Well done.

688
01:32:35.926 --> 01:32:38.969
Sacha, wait for me outside then.

689
01:32:46.937 --> 01:32:52.608
Danilov, you had no right to use him.

690
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:58.656
No, I didn't use him, Vassili.
He did it of his own accord.

691
01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:03.202
Do you know why?
Because he believes in you!

692
01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:14.755
Tomorrow morning, we're gonna
take back the chemical factory.

693
01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:17.883
Sacha has informed the major
you'll be there.

694
01:33:18.635 --> 01:33:20.761
So now you know
where you have to wait for him.

695
01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:24.181
- In the middle of an assault.
- I'm following orders.

696
01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:26.392
I suggest you do the same.

697
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:32.022
Now, I'm aware of the risks.
You'll be fine.

698
01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.530
Comrade.

699
01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:10.144
That's the Germans up there.
Yesterday, it was the Russians.

700
01:34:10.228 --> 01:34:12.229
We're not very far now.

701
01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:15.733
Sacha,

702
01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:20.112
you're playing a very dangerous game.

703
01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:22.740
I want you to win.

704
01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:27.036
See there? Keep going along the river.

705
01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.663
It's safe for a while.

706
01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:10.193
He's dead.

707
01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:13.363
We found this on his corpse.

708
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.869
Your reason for being here
has ceased to exist.

709
01:39:19.829 --> 01:39:21.830
Pardon me, Herr General.

710
01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:24.291
But I do not believe...

711
01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:28.795
There's a plane bound for Berlin
tomorrow evening. You will be on it.

712
01:39:32.383 --> 01:39:35.344
Until then I must ask you
for your dog tags.

713
01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:41.058
Imagine how Russian propaganda
would profit from your death.

714
01:39:41.184 --> 01:39:43.727
If you fall, you will fall unknown.

715
01:39:44.062 --> 01:39:46.396
You've already had a near miss.

716
01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:58.200
Also, please take this war merit cross.

717
01:39:58.284 --> 01:40:00.202
It was awarded posthumously
to a lieutenant

718
01:40:00.286 --> 01:40:01.953
of the 116th infantry division,

719
01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:05.415
who fell here
during the first days of the battle.

720
01:40:07.043 --> 01:40:08.627
He was my son.

721
01:40:11.422 --> 01:40:14.508
If the landing is captured,
everything's lost.

722
01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:18.470
Come here.

723
01:40:22.141 --> 01:40:23.934
What did I tell you?

724
01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:26.687
You've been playing your fiddle
too much.

725
01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:29.940
If it's confirmed that he's dead,
we're sunk.

726
01:40:30.566 --> 01:40:33.318
- Well, you're sunk.
- It isn't true.

727
01:40:33.403 --> 01:40:36.196
It was intercepted
from their staff headquarters.

728
01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.950
What do they have to do?
Dangle his body in front of our men?

729
01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:41.576
They're lying.

730
01:40:42.453 --> 01:40:44.121
That's good.

731
01:40:44.205 --> 01:40:45.747
Very good.

732
01:40:46.749 --> 01:40:50.293
Write it then.
Vassili Zaitsev is not dead!

733
01:40:50.378 --> 01:40:52.838
This is what he had for breakfast
this morning.

734
01:40:52.922 --> 01:40:56.091
This is a picture of him
reading today's newspaper.

735
01:40:56.175 --> 01:40:57.759
You're the poet.

736
01:40:57.844 --> 01:41:01.263
What? You won't give up the riverbank.

737
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:05.225
I don't care if you've lost half your men.

738
01:41:05.309 --> 01:41:07.936
Lose the other half or lose yourself!

739
01:41:14.569 --> 01:41:15.986
Is he back?

740
01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:21.324
He should be back soon.

741
01:41:21.951 --> 01:41:25.537
The German attack cut the lines,
that's why he's late.

742
01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:30.542
Can we go outside?

743
01:41:36.841 --> 01:41:39.259
I wrote to my mother about you.

744
01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:41.720
She wanted me to tell you
that once this war was over,

745
01:41:41.804 --> 01:41:43.930
if there's anything you needed,
anything at all,

746
01:41:44.015 --> 01:41:46.516
our family will be there for you.

747
01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:50.854
You know I'm here for you.

748
01:41:55.818 --> 01:41:57.736
They're saying Vassili is dead.

749
01:41:58.029 --> 01:42:01.573
Vassili Zaitsev will never see
his loved ones again.

750
01:42:02.366 --> 01:42:05.660
Surrender. This is your only hope.

751
01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:11.541
You're upset?

752
01:42:13.503 --> 01:42:15.545
Because Zaitsev is dead?

753
01:42:17.673 --> 01:42:20.967
You don't have to hide it.
There's no shame in it.

754
01:42:21.677 --> 01:42:23.804
You're Russian like he is.

755
01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:28.725
Don't listen to them.

756
01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:31.436
It's just propaganda.

757
01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.022
He isn't dead.

758
01:42:35.566 --> 01:42:37.359
And do you know why?

759
01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:41.321
Because I haven't killed him yet.

760
01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:51.164
I'm going to tell you a little secret.

761
01:42:51.249 --> 01:42:54.125
Only you,
because I know I can trust you.

762
01:42:55.044 --> 01:42:58.839
But you must swear to me
that you won't tell another soul.

763
01:43:00.842 --> 01:43:02.217
You swear?

764
01:43:03.928 --> 01:43:05.971
I found a terrific spot.

765
01:43:06.722 --> 01:43:09.641
It's by the exit from the train station.

766
01:43:09.892 --> 01:43:12.185
I'll hide in the water tower.

767
01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:15.146
Tomorrow I'll wait for him there.

768
01:43:16.232 --> 01:43:18.942
You'll see. He'll be there.

769
01:43:20.903 --> 01:43:22.487
He always is.

770
01:43:32.707 --> 01:43:34.124
I also want you to swear to me

771
01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:37.335
that from now on you'll stay home
where you belong.

772
01:43:38.004 --> 01:43:39.546
Do you swear?

773
01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.048
Yes?

774
01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:46.887
Good.

775
01:43:47.805 --> 01:43:49.890
We know he's alive,
we know he won't fail us,

776
01:43:49.974 --> 01:43:51.808
we know because
he is a part of us now.

777
01:43:51.893 --> 01:43:53.727
Vassili is eternal.

778
01:43:56.397 --> 01:43:59.858
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere for you.

779
01:44:00.234 --> 01:44:03.695
Didn't you hear? I was dead.

780
01:44:03.779 --> 01:44:07.365
At least, noble sniper Zaitsev

781
01:44:09.785 --> 01:44:11.703
Vassili was dead.

782
01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:14.205
The real one.

783
01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:18.168
Me.

784
01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:24.132
I was asleep. And I missed my chance.

785
01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:27.344
Then I was curled up in a corner hiding

786
01:44:29.305 --> 01:44:31.681
from a man who wants to kill me.

787
01:44:32.141 --> 01:44:34.017
I'll talk to Khrushchev.

788
01:44:34.477 --> 01:44:37.395
He'll send you back to your old division.

789
01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:41.232
- Where's Tania?
- She's at the shelter.

790
01:44:41.317 --> 01:44:44.986
- I've been to the shelter.
- I told her you weren't dead.

791
01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:51.284
The major said so.
He said the other Germans were lying.

792
01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:55.080
He told me you were waiting for him
at the station.

793
01:44:58.084 --> 01:45:00.084
Vassili.

794
01:45:32.827 --> 01:45:34.494
My little Sacha.

795
01:45:35.955 --> 01:45:37.414
I knew it.

796
01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:57.809
- Vassili.
- Tania.

797
01:46:04.608 --> 01:46:06.609
I knew you weren't dead.

798
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:11.281
- How?
- Because we've only just met.

799
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:19.581
I prayed for the first time
since I was a little girl.

800
01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:24.419
When I opened my eyes,
Sacha was standing there

801
01:46:24.503 --> 01:46:26.963
waiting to give me the good news.

802
01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.761
I think he loves you even more than I do.

803
01:46:57.036 --> 01:46:59.412
To the proper military authority.

804
01:46:59.497 --> 01:47:01.039
I'm calling to
the commandant's attention,

805
01:47:01.123 --> 01:47:03.083
the recent changes noticed
in the attitude

806
01:47:03.167 --> 01:47:06.961
towards fighting
of soldier, Vassili Zaitsev.

807
01:47:07.046 --> 01:47:10.590
He has attempted, on several
occasions, to escape his duties,

808
01:47:10.674 --> 01:47:13.051
voiced doubts
on the chances of our victory,

809
01:47:13.135 --> 01:47:15.887
and made defeatist comments in public.

810
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:21.601
The inexplicable duration of his duel
with a Nazi sharpshooter

811
01:47:21.685 --> 01:47:26.898
can only be explained by his lack
of belief in the Communist ideal.

812
01:47:35.157 --> 01:47:37.033
Good morning, Sacha.

813
01:47:39.370 --> 01:47:42.455
Once again,
he knew exactly where to find me.

814
01:47:43.082 --> 01:47:45.458
Don't you think that's strange?

815
01:47:46.418 --> 01:47:48.753
Apart from me, only you knew.

816
01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:55.135
I don't hold it against you, Sacha.
You've done a very brave thing.

817
01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.681
You've chosen your camp.
I respect that.

818
01:47:59.765 --> 01:48:01.599
But it isn't my camp.

819
01:48:02.101 --> 01:48:03.935
We're both soldiers.

820
01:48:04.687 --> 01:48:08.356
We're both enemies,
so I know you understand.

821
01:48:09.608 --> 01:48:10.984
I'm annoyed with you, little Sacha,

822
01:48:11.068 --> 01:48:14.529
for not staying at home
as I made you swear to do.

823
01:48:15.281 --> 01:48:19.868
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me
to do what I'm going to have to do.

824
01:48:23.956 --> 01:48:27.542
I've never seen anyone frown
so much in their sleep.

825
01:48:31.213 --> 01:48:35.091
- How long have you been watching me?
- All night.

826
01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:39.137
You've been snoring away happily
for hours.

827
01:48:39.221 --> 01:48:41.472
I don't snore, do I?

828
01:48:42.266 --> 01:48:43.766
Like a pig!

829
01:48:43.851 --> 01:48:47.854
- I suppose I talk in my sleep as well?
- Yes.

830
01:48:50.858 --> 01:48:53.484
There's something I should tell you.

831
01:49:00.618 --> 01:49:04.412
On the train coming here,

832
01:49:07.583 --> 01:49:09.292
we were in the same car.

833
01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:10.418
No.

834
01:49:11.253 --> 01:49:12.629
I saw you.

835
01:49:13.797 --> 01:49:16.758
You were reading and you fell asleep.

836
01:49:19.762 --> 01:49:23.097
I didn't dare look at you,
you were so beautiful.

837
01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.684
You were scary.

838
01:49:29.813 --> 01:49:32.982
Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking
about you.

839
01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:35.777
It made me smile.

840
01:49:37.279 --> 01:49:41.449
And then I thought of all the men
who would get to hold you,

841
01:49:44.245 --> 01:49:46.120
who'd make you laugh,

842
01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:50.625
how lucky they were.

843
01:49:54.255 --> 01:49:57.006
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

844
01:49:59.843 --> 01:50:02.512
- Was I snoring?
- Like a pig.

845
01:50:35.546 --> 01:50:36.754
What?

846
01:50:40.509 --> 01:50:42.427
Oh, my God!

847
01:50:44.305 --> 01:50:45.680
Tania, no.

848
01:50:45.764 --> 01:50:47.765
- No, get off me!
- Tania, no.

849
01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:49.767
- Get off me!
- It's what he wants.

850
01:50:49.852 --> 01:50:51.728
- Get off me!
- This is what he wants.

851
01:50:51.812 --> 01:50:54.272
- Get off me!
- No. He'll kill you.

852
01:50:54.356 --> 01:50:55.690
- Let me go!
- He'll kill you,

853
01:50:55.774 --> 01:50:57.275
- and then I'll run after you...
- Let me go!

854
01:50:57.359 --> 01:50:59.319
- ... And he'll kill me, too.
- Let me go!

855
01:50:59.403 --> 01:51:03.740
This is what he wants. I'll get him.
I promise I'll get him.

856
01:51:05.117 --> 01:51:07.994
I'll get his rifle for you, I promise, Tania.

857
01:51:28.849 --> 01:51:30.308
I need you.

858
01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:37.190
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov.
Stalingrad may fall.

859
01:51:37.274 --> 01:51:39.817
The last of the boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.

860
01:51:39.902 --> 01:51:43.071
He's brought you a pass.
You'll be safe on the other side.

861
01:51:43.155 --> 01:51:44.238
You have to gather your things,

862
01:51:44.323 --> 01:51:46.032
and we'll help you carry them
to the landing stage.

863
01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:52.747
I'm not leaving. This is my home.
This is my Sacha's home. I can't leave.

864
01:51:52.831 --> 01:51:55.750
I have to tell you something,
Mrs. Filipov.

865
01:51:57.878 --> 01:52:00.671
Something very difficult to understand.

866
01:52:01.632 --> 01:52:03.341
It's about Sacha.

867
01:52:17.398 --> 01:52:20.149
He's gone over to the Germans.
He's betrayed his country.

868
01:52:20.234 --> 01:52:23.569
He's with the enemy now.
He won't be coming back.

869
01:52:25.239 --> 01:52:27.239
Oh, my God.

870
01:52:34.998 --> 01:52:36.958
He's become a traitor.

871
01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:40.628
The poor little thing.

872
01:52:41.797 --> 01:52:43.548
What has he done?

873
01:52:47.261 --> 01:52:49.804
So he's going to stay over there?

874
01:52:54.476 --> 01:52:57.895
Yes. He's going to stay over there.

875
01:53:00.482 --> 01:53:02.817
I shouldn't be saying this,
Comrade Commissar,

876
01:53:02.901 --> 01:53:05.153
but maybe it's for the best.

877
01:53:06.071 --> 01:53:08.448
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

878
01:53:08.532 --> 01:53:12.285
I know it's wrong,
but perhaps he's made the right choice.

879
01:53:32.764 --> 01:53:37.935
- Tania!
- Tania!

880
01:53:58.874 --> 01:54:02.335
I need a doctor. A doctor!

881
01:54:07.508 --> 01:54:11.636
I have a pass. I have a pass.
You must let her cross.

882
01:54:15.724 --> 01:54:16.974
Please.

883
01:54:17.351 --> 01:54:19.018
- It's useless. She'll never make it.
- No.

884
01:54:19.102 --> 01:54:25.149
No, she will. She's my daughter.
She's my daughter, I beg of you.

885
01:54:25.234 --> 01:54:29.654
All right. All right, you two,
put this one on the boat.

886
01:55:17.911 --> 01:55:21.247
Where is he? Where's the major?

887
01:55:21.707 --> 01:55:23.916
A few inches from your face.

888
01:55:26.587 --> 01:55:29.005
I've been such a fool, Vassili.

889
01:55:31.008 --> 01:55:33.009
Man will always be man.

890
01:55:34.011 --> 01:55:35.886
There is no new man.

891
01:55:37.514 --> 01:55:40.725
We tried so hard to create
a society that was equal,

892
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:44.061
where there'd be nothing
to envy your neighbor.

893
01:55:44.855 --> 01:55:47.565
But there's always something to envy.

894
01:55:48.942 --> 01:55:52.403
A smile, a friendship.

895
01:55:54.364 --> 01:55:57.700
Something you don't have
and want to appropriate.

896
01:55:58.535 --> 01:56:01.787
In this world, even a Soviet one,

897
01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.583
there will always be rich and poor.

898
01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:08.794
Rich in gifts,

899
01:56:10.631 --> 01:56:12.381
poor in gifts.

900
01:56:13.634 --> 01:56:15.134
Rich in love,

901
01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:18.721
poor in love.

902
01:56:25.062 --> 01:56:27.063
Tania isn't coming back.

903
01:56:29.232 --> 01:56:31.067
She's dead, Vassili.

904
01:56:39.993 --> 01:56:42.244
She was cut down by shrapnel.

905
01:56:42.329 --> 01:56:46.082
It was quick.
I don't think she even saw it coming.

906
01:56:47.959 --> 01:56:49.835
She was on her way back to you,

907
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:53.506
as soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov
to the boats.

908
01:56:53.590 --> 01:56:57.093
She was coming back for you.
She was right.

909
01:56:57.928 --> 01:57:00.096
You're a good man, Vassili.

910
01:57:04.309 --> 01:57:08.979
I want to help you, Vassili.
Let me do one last thing.

911
01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:11.816
Something useful for a change.

912
01:57:18.031 --> 01:57:22.618
- Let me show you where the major is.
- No, don't do that. Don't do that!

913
02:01:36.873 --> 02:01:41.877
Today, February the 3rd, 1943,
is an ominous day for Hitler

914
02:01:41.962 --> 02:01:46.382
and the endless columns of hundreds
of thousands of German prisoners.

915
02:01:46.466 --> 02:01:50.260
It is an unforgettable day of hope
for our motherland,

916
02:01:50.387 --> 02:01:53.389
for the people of
the Soviet Union, and...

917
02:02:02.565 --> 02:02:09.405
Today after 180 days of growing combat
in the martyred city of Stalingrad,

918
02:02:09.489 --> 02:02:14.702
and as a result of the valor
and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,

919
02:02:14.786 --> 02:02:17.955
the commander
of our glorious Red Army

920
02:02:18.081 --> 02:02:23.752
received the unconditional surrender
of the German fascist invasion.

921
02:02:39.936 --> 02:02:41.979
I cannot find the matching name
in the book.

922
02:02:42.105 --> 02:02:44.857
Could you check again, please?
This is the address of this hospital

923
02:02:44.941 --> 02:02:46.233
- and this is her name.
- She's not here, Comrade.

924
02:02:46.317 --> 02:02:47.568
Yes. This is our address,

925
02:02:47.652 --> 02:02:50.821
- but she's not here.
- We don't have her any more.

926
02:02:50.947 --> 02:02:52.114
This is the address of this place...

927
02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:53.699
- I'm so sorry.
- ... so she's obviously been here.

928
02:02:53.783 --> 02:02:55.284
- She wrote to me.
- ... three times in the books,

929
02:02:55.410 --> 02:02:56.660
but she's not here.

930
02:02:56.786 --> 02:03:02.291
Believe me. There is no
Tania Chernova. I can't help you.
