00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:04.440
(Bird chirping)

3
00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:37.723
Man: I am a stone.

4
00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:41.852
I do not move.

5
00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:52.196
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth.

6
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.324
Then he won't see my breath.

7
00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.745
(Whinnying)

8
00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:05.084
I take my time.

9
00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:10.715
I let him come closer.
I have only one bullet.

10
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.346
I aim at his eye very gently.
My finger presses on the trigger.

11
00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:23.436
I do not tremble.

12
00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.732
I have no fear.

13
00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:30.526
I'm a big boy now.

14
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.824
Ready, vassili?

15
00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:39.994
Now, vassili. Fire!

16
00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.122
Fire, vassili! Fire!

17
00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.421

18
00:03:41.472 --> 00:03:43.182
(Train whistle blowing)

19
00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.393
Man: Come on, pick your feet up.

20
00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:48.437
Get on your feet.
Prepare to board the train.

21
00:03:49.605 --> 00:03:51.023
(Chattering)

22
00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:00.408
You there, come along with me now.
This way, pal.

23
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:01.867
(Clamoring)

24
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:05.621
Man: All civilians, get out!

25
00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.832
Make way, let the civilians off.

26
00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:10.626
Man on pa: This is a military convoy.

27
00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.381
No one stays on board
but our Valiant soldiers.

28
00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:22.721
This is a convoy to stalingrad.
Only for the soldiers of the red army.

29
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.395
(Man on P.A. continues
chattering indistinctly)

30
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:34.108
No one stays on board
but our Valiant soldiers.

31
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.036
All aboard!

32
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:14.190
Na rra Tor.” Autumn, 1942.

33
00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:17.693
Europe lies crushed
beneath the Nazi jackboot.

34
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.700
The German third reich
is at the height of its power.

35
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.912
Hitler's armies are charging
through the heart of the Soviet union

36
00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.289
towards the oil fields of Asia.

37
00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.042
One last obstacle remains.

38
00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:36.462
A city on the volga where
the fate of the world is being decided.

39
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:37.963
Stalingrad.

40
00:05:41.926 --> 00:05:43.552
(Train clacking)

41
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.616
Man: The red army and all citizens
of the Soviet union

42
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.996
must defend every inch of Soviet soil.
Must fight to the last...

43
00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:23.759
(Men shouting indistinctly)

44
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:33.936
Glorious comrade Stalin has ordered
not another step backwards,

45
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.731
so the people of the Soviet union
shall be free.

46
00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:57.293
Let's go fonnards, comrades.
Not a step backwards.

47
00:07:09.138 --> 00:07:11.140
(Explosions in distance)

48
00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:18.105
Man: Listen to these letters
sent by Russian mothers

49
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.816
to their sons on the front.

50
00:07:21.859 --> 00:07:27.031
Volodya, our child,
I know that it is for our motherland...

51
00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:34.788
I know it is for our motherland
that you are giving your life.

52
00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.458
(All shouting)

53
00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.297
(Shouting continues)

54
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:55.059
Everyone here knows
that you will not fall back.

55
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.395
Everyone here is proud of you.

56
00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:02.941
Your father is dead.
Your brothers are dead.

57
00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:05.861
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists.

58
00:08:14.578 --> 00:08:16.080
(All shouting)

59
00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:47.945
Man: Nobody move! Stay on the boat!

60
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.532
Get back or I'll shoot.
Get back from the rails or we'll shoot.

61
00:08:51.615 --> 00:08:53.992
Shoot the traitors!

62
00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.558
Prepare to disembark!

63
00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.987
Come on, come on! Move!

64
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:36.618
Come on, comrades. Come on!

65
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.664
Move or you'll be shot!

66
00:09:46.545 --> 00:09:47.546
(Clamoring)

67
00:09:56.847 --> 00:09:58.766
Man: Over here, stretcher.

68
00:10:04.772 --> 00:10:09.902
- The one with the rifle shoots.
- One out of two gets a rifle.

69
00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:16.450
The one without follows him.
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

70
00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:22.414
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

71
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:26.627
The one with the rifle shoots.

72
00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:30.506
The one without follows him.

73
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:34.343
When the one with the rifle gets killed,

74
00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:39.640
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots.

75
00:10:40.516 --> 00:10:43.227
The one with the rifle shoots.

76
00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:13.298
Man on P.A.: Soldiers of
the glorious red army,

77
00:11:13.382 --> 00:11:18.220
from now on,
it is either victory or death.

78
00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:20.889
- Those who retreat...
- I need a rifle.

79
00:11:20.973 --> 00:11:22.683
- Will be shot.
- I need a rifle.

80
00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:27.271
There will be no mercy
for cowards and traitors.

81
00:11:27.813 --> 00:11:29.439
(Speaking German)

82
00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:39.241
(Cocking guns)

83
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.577
(Man shouting in German)

84
00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:48.500
(Blowing whistle)

85
00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:49.835
(Yelling)

86
00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:01.179
(Yelling continues)

87
00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:20.133
It's hopeless, comrades. Get back.

88
00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.929
Fall back! Fall back!

89
00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:27.516
It's no good. Get back. Get back.

90
00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:35.357
Man: In the name of the Soviet union,
not a step backwards, or we shoot!

91
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.820
- No retreat. Not a step back.
- No mercy.

92
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.697
Deserters will be shot.

93
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.281
- Fire!
- Fire!

94
00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:51.540
No mercy for cowards.

95
00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:30.787
Man on P.A.: Russians, surrender.

96
00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:35.292
You will see your home again.
This is not your war.

97
00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:40.881
Join your German comrades.
They understand your suffering

98
00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:44.760
and will care more for you
than your own officers,

99
00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:51.016
who are only sending you to your death.
The third reich is not your enemy.

100
00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:55.896
The enemy is bloodthirsty Stalin
and his bolshevik gang...

101
00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.606
(P.A. fading our)

102
00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:23.507
Fire!

103
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.524
(Gasping)

104
00:15:49.241 --> 00:15:50.534
(Panting)

105
00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:55.956
(Speaking German)

106
00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:57.374
(Panting)

107
00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:32.784
(Officer shouting in German)

108
00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:54.514
(Retching)

109
00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:25.045
Man: You'll get us caught,
comrade commissar.

110
00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:36.640
(Clicking)

111
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.107
(Bomb exploding in distance)

112
00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.528
With your permission,
comrade commissar.

113
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.787
(Bomb exploding)

114
00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.935
(Explosions continuing)

115
00:18:22.978 --> 00:18:25.063
Which one do you think
I should I aim at first?

116
00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:28.441
You should wait till there's an explosion.

117
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.530
(Breathing heavily)

118
00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:44.791
- Do you know how to shoot?
- A little.

119
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.066
Damn!

120
00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:12.402
(Speaking German)

121
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.553
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.

122
00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.163
Thank you, comrade commissar.

123
00:20:53.753 --> 00:21:00.635
Danilov. Political officer,
second class, 21st infantry.

124
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.073
Vassili zaitsev.

125
00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:23.283
(Chuckles)

126
00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:29.122
On this day, September 20th, 1942,
a young Shepherd boy from the urals

127
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.832
(bomb exploding)

128
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.213
Arrived in the city of stalingrad
on the banks of the volga.

129
00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:40.049
His name is vassili zaitsev.

130
00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:46.556
Like thousands before him, he came
to answer comrade Stalin's call.

131
00:21:47.849 --> 00:21:51.561
Armed only with a rifle, he quickly
made the fascist invader realize

132
00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:56.900
that from now on he would be punished
for every step he took in the motherland,

133
00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:59.736
that from here on
the only way was back.

134
00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.033
What do you think?

135
00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.704
I think comrade commissar
has been overgenerous.

136
00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:21.508
(Women screaming)

137
00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:22.717
(Men shouting)

138
00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:28.515
Woman: Let me go!

139
00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:40.360
Man: By order of comrade Stalin,
no civilian can leave the city.

140
00:22:42.362 --> 00:22:43.947
Get back there!

141
00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:45.573
Move back!

142
00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:48.576
Man: Stand away, or we will open fire.

143
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.994
(Clamoring)

144
00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.963
(Woman screaming)

145
00:23:00.046 --> 00:23:01.214
Man: Stand away!

146
00:23:01.297 --> 00:23:02.840
Man: Keep back!

147
00:23:04.926 --> 00:23:06.344
Get back or we shoot.

148
00:23:06.427 --> 00:23:08.346
Back! Keep back, there!

149
00:23:09.055 --> 00:23:12.559
Man: Make way
for comrade Stalin's envoy.

150
00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:21.734
I carried out my orders.
I sent in all of my boys.

151
00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:25.154
But the Germans engulfed us.

152
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:30.743
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks.

153
00:23:30.827 --> 00:23:34.831
- And me, what did I have?
- A sacred duty to resist.

154
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.084
I have to report to the boss.

155
00:23:40.169 --> 00:23:43.339
Perhaps you would prefer
to avoid the red tape.

156
00:23:58.229 --> 00:23:59.230
(Gunshot)

157
00:23:59.314 --> 00:24:00.356
(Body falling)

158
00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:12.660
My name is
nikita sergeyevich khrushchev.

159
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.998
I've come to take things in hand here.

160
00:24:17.498 --> 00:24:24.005
This city is not kursk,
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

161
00:24:25.214 --> 00:24:28.801
This city is stalingrad.

162
00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:31.012
Stalingrad!

163
00:24:32.847 --> 00:24:38.061
This city bears the name of the boss.
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

164
00:24:39.062 --> 00:24:43.399
If the Germans capture this city,

165
00:24:44.233 --> 00:24:46.861
the entire country will collapse.

166
00:24:48.488 --> 00:24:54.410
Now, I want our boys
to raise their heads.

167
00:24:55.912 --> 00:24:58.665
I want them to act like they have balls.

168
00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:02.585
I want them to stop shitting their pants.

169
00:25:06.923 --> 00:25:08.591
That's your job.

170
00:25:10.093 --> 00:25:15.598
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.

171
00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:22.063
You, what's your suggestion?

172
00:25:23.106 --> 00:25:27.860
Shoot all the other generals who have
retreated and their chiefs of staff, too.

173
00:25:28.903 --> 00:25:32.657
(Stuttering) Make some examples.
Deport the families of the deserters...

174
00:25:32.782 --> 00:25:34.909
That's all been done.

175
00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:36.619
Danilov: Give them hope.

176
00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:53.386
Here, the men's only choice
is between German bullets and ours.

177
00:25:53.469 --> 00:25:56.347
But there's another way,
a way of courage.

178
00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:59.100
A way of love of the motherland.

179
00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:02.437
We must publish the army newspaper
again, we must tell magnificent stories,

180
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.273
stories that exalt sacrifice, bravery.

181
00:26:05.356 --> 00:26:07.775
We must make them believe
in a victory.

182
00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:11.487
We must give them hope, pride,
a desire to fight.

183
00:26:12.947 --> 00:26:14.031
Yes.

184
00:26:14.532 --> 00:26:17.994
We need to make examples,
but examples to follow.

185
00:26:19.162 --> 00:26:23.499
What we need are heroes.

186
00:26:27.503 --> 00:26:30.047
Do you know any heroes around here?

187
00:26:30.465 --> 00:26:33.885
Yes, comrade. I know one.

188
00:26:40.349 --> 00:26:44.979
That's me. Vassili zaitsev. That's me.

189
00:26:45.688 --> 00:26:48.816
No, you're not dreaming. It's your name.

190
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.360
We made the front page.

191
00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:54.739
They haven't changed a word.

192
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:58.242
Do you have any idea what this means?

193
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.454
It's not the back page.
It's not the second page.

194
00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:03.873
- It's the front page. The front page!
- Front page.

195
00:27:03.998 --> 00:27:06.000
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere,

196
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:09.504
in the caucasus, in the crimea,
even in the urals.

197
00:27:10.379 --> 00:27:13.966
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself
will be sitting over breakfast,

198
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.886
reading my words,
memorizing your name.

199
00:27:17.386 --> 00:27:20.389
We're famous, vassili.
Khrushchev loved the article.

200
00:27:20.515 --> 00:27:22.975
He's promoted me to the general staff

201
00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:25.770
and you to sniper division.

202
00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:30.024
- Well, that's good.
- It's very good.

203
00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:32.026
- It's very good. It's great!
- It's very great!

204
00:27:32.109 --> 00:27:33.277
- It's great!
- It's great!

205
00:27:33.402 --> 00:27:37.114
It's great for both of us
because we did it together. Together.

206
00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.200
Well, now, admittedly,
I did all the hard work.

207
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:40.844
You know, you're very lucky
I can't fight back.

208
00:27:40.868 --> 00:27:42.620
- Why's that?
- Because khrushchev told me

209
00:27:42.745 --> 00:27:44.056
to make sure nothing happens to you.

210
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.760
- You're too important.
- I'm too valuable.

211
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:49.043
Yes. Careful of my glasses, please,
they're new.

212
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:50.586
Sorry, sir.

213
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.215
- I'm famous.
- I'm famous.

214
00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:55.842
- We're famous.
- I'm famous.

215
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:58.177
Announcer 1: Vassili, the young
Shepherd from the urals,

216
00:27:58.261 --> 00:27:59.929
killed his 12th German officer today.

217
00:28:00.054 --> 00:28:02.241
Announcer 2: Used to hunt wolves,
now he shoots fascists.

218
00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:03.575
Today vassili zaitsev shot his 23rd...

219
00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:04.910
Announcer 3:
One more colonel shot by...

220
00:28:04.934 --> 00:28:06.411
Announcer 4: He is an example
to us all.

221
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:08.896
Announcer 2: Today vassili zaitsev
killed his 32nd general.

222
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.315
(Announcers continue chattering)

223
00:28:11.816 --> 00:28:14.277
Announcer 4:
Thirty-sixth German officer...

224
00:28:14.402 --> 00:28:18.573
The Germans you have killed?
Today vassili zaitsev killed...

225
00:28:18.656 --> 00:28:22.785
Announcer 1: Eleven dog tags
retrieved by sniper vassili zaitsev...

226
00:28:22.869 --> 00:28:25.246
(Announcers continue chattering)

227
00:28:26.998 --> 00:28:28.392
Announcer 5: More and more
men and women,

228
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:30.376
fighters from all branches
of our armed forces,

229
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:35.339
volunteer to join the sniper division
and learn the skills of vassili zaitsev.

230
00:28:39.468 --> 00:28:41.888
Vassili: I am a stone.

231
00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:46.475
I am a stone.

232
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:50.813
I breathe slowly.

233
00:28:57.945 --> 00:28:59.989
I aim at the eye.

234
00:29:02.116 --> 00:29:03.826
(Breathing deeply)

235
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:31.520
So it is you.

236
00:29:32.855 --> 00:29:34.899
The great vassili zaitsev.

237
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.819
My mother makes the best potatoes
and bacon in town.

238
00:29:38.903 --> 00:29:39.987
Sounds good.

239
00:29:40.071 --> 00:29:43.074
When she sees you,
she won't believe her eyes.

240
00:29:44.659 --> 00:29:47.536
- How many today?
- Only two.

241
00:29:49.038 --> 00:29:51.457
And the last one,
why didn't you shoot him?

242
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.711
He was only a foot soldier.
It wasn't worth giving away my position.

243
00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:57.147
(Man chattering indistinctly
on radio)

244
00:29:57.171 --> 00:29:58.589
Bless you.

245
00:30:00.424 --> 00:30:02.718
We know how much we owe you.

246
00:30:03.427 --> 00:30:05.554
We pray for you every day.

247
00:30:06.681 --> 00:30:10.726
Every evening we listen to them
talk about you on radio Moscow.

248
00:30:12.103 --> 00:30:13.354
Thanks.

249
00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:15.082
You've certainly managed well
down here.

250
00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:19.026
My parents used to store furniture
down here before the war.

251
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:22.989
Sacha, drop that right now.

252
00:30:23.072 --> 00:30:24.573
It's loaded.

253
00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:27.493
(Knocking at door)

254
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:37.128
- This way, comrade commissar.
- Thank you, comrade.

255
00:30:39.714 --> 00:30:41.132
Good evening.

256
00:30:44.802 --> 00:30:46.470
Comrade zaitsev.

257
00:30:52.143 --> 00:30:55.104
My god, where does
all this mail come from?

258
00:30:55.938 --> 00:30:59.608
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

259
00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:02.653
This one's from the workers
of the kuzbass.

260
00:31:02.778 --> 00:31:05.448
They want to name their mine
after vassili.

261
00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:08.117
Right, let's start with the miners.

262
00:31:09.452 --> 00:31:11.662
Come on, let's get to work.

263
00:31:16.667 --> 00:31:19.462
- Dear comrades from the kuzbass...
- Kuzbass.

264
00:31:19.587 --> 00:31:22.465
I thank you for your letter of praise.

265
00:31:22.923 --> 00:31:25.259
- Praise?
- R-a-i-s-e.

266
00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:29.638
And

267
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:35.686
I hope that I can live up
to your expectations.

268
00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:38.522
A-t-i-o-n-s.

269
00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:40.524
Expectations.

270
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.279
You're interested in German literature,
Mrs. Filipov?

271
00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:47.073
(Knocking at door)

272
00:31:47.656 --> 00:31:50.326
Mrs. Filipov: It's all right.
It's our neighbor.

273
00:31:51.327 --> 00:31:52.536
Right. Where were we?

274
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:56.582
- Tania, we have guests.
- Expectations. Your offer to name...

275
00:32:07.093 --> 00:32:09.011
I recognize you.

276
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.557
It's vassili zaitsev.

277
00:32:17.186 --> 00:32:21.857
I saw your picture in the paper.
Thank you for everything you're doing.

278
00:32:22.942 --> 00:32:26.195
- And this is his friend, commissar...
- Danilov.

279
00:32:27.196 --> 00:32:28.447
Danilov.

280
00:32:29.198 --> 00:32:30.866
Tania's like a daughter to me.

281
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:33.869
She used to take care of sacha
when I worked at the factory.

282
00:32:33.953 --> 00:32:37.289
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.

283
00:32:37.373 --> 00:32:40.292
- They're yours?
- She studied German at the university.

284
00:32:40.376 --> 00:32:42.419
- Which university?
- Moscow.

285
00:32:48.217 --> 00:32:49.635
Moscow.

286
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:57.476
- Shouldn't we...
- Yes, let's continue.

287
00:32:59.311 --> 00:33:04.108
Your offer to name your mine
after me is

288
00:33:05.818 --> 00:33:07.444
a great honor.

289
00:33:09.071 --> 00:33:11.991
H-o-n.

290
00:33:13.075 --> 00:33:15.995
- Yes, I know, honor.
- Very good.

291
00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:22.293
Shouldn't we try and make the point
that I'm not the only one fighting?

292
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:27.548
Danilov: That's an excellent
idea, vassili. Excellent.

293
00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:31.177
We can take it even further, though.
Yeah, we can take it further.

294
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:38.267
Your battle for the production of coal
is as worthy as mine.

295
00:33:40.853 --> 00:33:43.439
There's no "k" in coal.

296
00:33:44.273 --> 00:33:46.442
Just one "I."

297
00:33:47.193 --> 00:33:48.527
That's it.

298
00:33:49.028 --> 00:33:51.488
Danilov: Tell me if I'm going too fast.

299
00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.657
- No, you're not going too fast.
- Are you sure?

300
00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:56.785
I just thought...
Is there any other improvements?

301
00:33:56.869 --> 00:34:01.040
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.

302
00:34:01.123 --> 00:34:05.044
We should carry on.
We're not tired. Thank you, Mrs. Filipov.

303
00:34:05.127 --> 00:34:08.797
These people took the trouble
to write to us.

304
00:34:10.007 --> 00:34:12.885
Tomorrow, we may not be around
to write back.

305
00:34:13.344 --> 00:34:15.262
(Train whistle blowing)

306
00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:23.687
(Man speaking German on P.A.)

307
00:35:24.957 --> 00:35:26.625
(Speaking German)

308
00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.776
I was expecting someone else.

309
00:35:53.235 --> 00:35:57.656
Certainly not someone so prestigious.
I imagine you have your reasons

310
00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.410
for getting yourself involved
in this hellish situation.

311
00:36:05.331 --> 00:36:09.043
My army is not designed
for this kind of fighting.

312
00:36:09.126 --> 00:36:12.338
Yesterday, yet again,
I had to promote 25 sergeants

313
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:16.133
to replace the officers shot down
by their sharpshooters.

314
00:36:17.259 --> 00:36:20.346
Those snipers are demoralizing
my people.

315
00:36:21.764 --> 00:36:27.770
This city is no more
than a heap of ruins.

316
00:36:29.772 --> 00:36:32.149
But the ftihrer's persisting.

317
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.029
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

318
00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:45.371
We should trust the fuhrer's instinct.

319
00:36:46.288 --> 00:36:49.124
He always managed
to lead us to victory.

320
00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:54.505
We shall be back home for Christmas.

321
00:36:58.509 --> 00:37:02.304
How are you going to go about
finding this young Russian?

322
00:37:03.806 --> 00:37:06.975
I'll fix it so that he's the one
who finds me.

323
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.523
Vassili! Vassili!

324
00:37:12.648 --> 00:37:15.442
- Come on! Time to get up.
- What?

325
00:37:15.526 --> 00:37:17.212
They have a problem in the
department store sector.

326
00:37:17.236 --> 00:37:19.154
They need us. Come on.

327
00:37:28.914 --> 00:37:32.835
Look, vassili, he's hiding
in the department store, over there.

328
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:43.262
So far this morning, he's knocked off
five officers plus two machine gunners.

329
00:37:46.348 --> 00:37:48.350
Look! Third floor.

330
00:37:49.518 --> 00:37:54.440
- Fourth window from the left.
- Fourth window from the left.

331
00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.570
See him?

332
00:38:00.779 --> 00:38:02.448
Yeah, I see him.

333
00:38:14.543 --> 00:38:18.213
- There, you got him!
- Ludmilla: Great shot.

334
00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:24.303
Let's go get his dog tag.

335
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:30.452
Mrs. Filipov: Goodbye,
comrade commissar.

336
00:38:30.476 --> 00:38:33.437
Thank you for your hospitality,
Mrs. Filipov.

337
00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:44.391
You can borrow whatever you like.

338
00:38:44.448 --> 00:38:47.826
I'm not sure what they would say
to me at headquarters

339
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:51.288
if I came back with an armful
of goethe and Schiller.

340
00:38:51.413 --> 00:38:53.332
There's some Marx, too.

341
00:38:54.124 --> 00:38:56.835
You were assigned to civil defense
at the 12th district?

342
00:38:56.919 --> 00:38:58.754
No, I volunteered.

343
00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:02.049
It's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

344
00:39:02.132 --> 00:39:04.092
Comrade khrushchev was telling me
just yesterday

345
00:39:04.176 --> 00:39:06.970
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

346
00:39:07.095 --> 00:39:11.350
I can't. Our militia is responsible for
all the people in this neighborhood.

347
00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:12.744
We're already desperately short of men.

348
00:39:12.768 --> 00:39:13.852
We can take care of that.

349
00:39:13.936 --> 00:39:16.122
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for every one that speaks German.

350
00:39:16.146 --> 00:39:17.856
I'd rather stay and fight.

351
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.776
Serving the headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.

352
00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:25.405
You stay here. You cover us.

353
00:39:25.489 --> 00:39:27.616
- Soldier: All right.
- We go.

354
00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:31.662
Take care.

355
00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:38.252
Ludmilla, come on.

356
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:48.178
(Man yelling in German)

357
00:40:30.178 --> 00:40:31.930
Take the stainnay.

358
00:42:21.998 --> 00:42:24.251
- It's a trap.
- I know.

359
00:42:50.694 --> 00:42:52.070
Move back.

360
00:43:41.328 --> 00:43:42.954
He's still here.

361
00:44:06.478 --> 00:44:10.857
- They're coming straight for us.
- Ludmilla, stay where you are.

362
00:44:11.733 --> 00:44:12.943
He's over there somewhere.

363
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.165
We have to get out of here!

364
00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:32.921
- We have to get out of here!
- Just stay where you are!

365
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.178
- What are we gonna do?
- Ludmilla, stay where you are!

366
00:44:52.357 --> 00:44:54.150
Fuck this, I'm going.

367
00:44:56.695 --> 00:44:58.154
Ludmilla, no!

368
00:45:51.833 --> 00:45:53.668
What does this mean?

369
00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.340
"A little Shepherd from the urals
receives a new sniper's rifle.

370
00:45:58.423 --> 00:46:03.094
"A mosin nagant 7.62,
with its 3.5-power pu telescope,

371
00:46:03.178 --> 00:46:06.014
"pride of precision of Soviet production."

372
00:46:07.015 --> 00:46:09.434
- I've seen that rifle close up.
- Have you?

373
00:46:09.517 --> 00:46:11.186
I even touched it.

374
00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:14.189
I know him well, vassili zaitsev.

375
00:46:54.604 --> 00:46:55.647
(Whistling)

376
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:57.607
(Men speaking Russian)

377
00:47:03.905 --> 00:47:06.658
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today.

378
00:47:07.659 --> 00:47:10.912
- And it was my fault.
- No. I'm sure that's not true.

379
00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:13.081
There was a German sniper.

380
00:47:13.999 --> 00:47:16.584
I walked them right into his trap.

381
00:47:17.377 --> 00:47:19.921
- Danilov: What else can you tell me?
- He didn't relocate.

382
00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:25.051
A sniper who doesn't relocate
isn't normal.

383
00:47:26.553 --> 00:47:28.179
He was very good.

384
00:47:28.263 --> 00:47:31.516
It wasn'tjust his shooting,
it was his instinct.

385
00:47:32.934 --> 00:47:35.770
He was a step ahead of me all the time.

386
00:47:35.854 --> 00:47:38.898
That's because
he knows everything about you.

387
00:47:39.441 --> 00:47:45.947
His name is konig. Major konig.
They've sent him here to...

388
00:47:47.741 --> 00:47:49.200
To find you.

389
00:47:57.208 --> 00:47:59.395
At first, we weren't sure
if the information was reliable.

390
00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:02.464
It seems he's come all the way
from Berlin to stop you.

391
00:48:02.547 --> 00:48:03.858
You've caused them
so many sleepless nights,

392
00:48:03.882 --> 00:48:05.192
they've sent their top marksman
after you.

393
00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:09.304
- So, what do we know about him?
- He's a major in the wehrmacht.

394
00:48:11.097 --> 00:48:14.225
He's director of their sniper school
in zossen.

395
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:17.729
Koulikov studied under him
at zossen before the war.

396
00:48:17.812 --> 00:48:21.983
He knows all his tricks. From now on
he'll go with you everywhere.

397
00:48:23.318 --> 00:48:26.321
A nobleman from Bavaria
who hunts deer

398
00:48:26.404 --> 00:48:28.632
against the Shepherd boy from the urals
who poaches wolves.

399
00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:29.657
(Chuckung)

400
00:48:29.741 --> 00:48:33.161
It's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

401
00:48:36.498 --> 00:48:39.084
It's the essence of class struggle.

402
00:48:39.626 --> 00:48:41.669
I'm glad you're so happy.

403
00:48:42.754 --> 00:48:46.049
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

404
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:49.177
No one shoots like you, vassili.

405
00:48:58.311 --> 00:49:00.188
She's been transferred.

406
00:49:02.524 --> 00:49:05.485
I'll see if they're ready
for you next door.

407
00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:10.448
Hello.

408
00:49:10.532 --> 00:49:13.201
You look very smart
in your new uniform.

409
00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:17.872
Make sure they don't take it back
once you've finished.

410
00:49:17.997 --> 00:49:19.791
They probably will.

411
00:49:23.461 --> 00:49:26.297
I've heard the rumor
about the German.

412
00:49:27.132 --> 00:49:30.718
- And I wanted to wish you luck.
- Thank you. I'll need it.

413
00:49:31.177 --> 00:49:35.014
From what comrade Danilov tells me,
you're going to win.

414
00:49:37.225 --> 00:49:38.226
Hmm.

415
00:49:41.062 --> 00:49:42.188
It's time.

416
00:49:42.647 --> 00:49:43.648
(Russian music playing)

417
00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:44.816
Woman: Vassili?

418
00:49:44.899 --> 00:49:47.694
- Man 1: Vassili? Vassili?
- Come to my arms.

419
00:49:49.028 --> 00:49:51.865
Man 1: Look in my direction, here.
Here, vassili.

420
00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:55.708
Put your cap back on.
You'll look more heroic.

421
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:58.222
- Man 1: This way, comrade zaitsev.
- I love this little fellow.

422
00:49:58.246 --> 00:50:00.683
Man 2: Vassili, is it true that
you volunteered for the front?

423
00:50:00.707 --> 00:50:01.958
- Vassili?
- Man 3: Vassili?

424
00:50:02.041 --> 00:50:03.084
How old are you, vassili?

425
00:50:03.168 --> 00:50:04.979
Do you know what this duel
means for our country?

426
00:50:05.003 --> 00:50:07.064
Is it true you killed your first wolf
when you were five?

427
00:50:07.088 --> 00:50:08.983
Vassili, tell us, how many fascists
have you killed today?

428
00:50:09.007 --> 00:50:11.527
Man 4: Are you proud to be challenged
by the best sharpshooter in Germany?

429
00:50:11.551 --> 00:50:14.262
It's a sign the Germans
are starting to shit their pants.

430
00:50:14.345 --> 00:50:17.432
Go on, my boy, tell us
how are you going to deal with him?

431
00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:19.410
- Or rather, no.
- Man 4: One more question, please.

432
00:50:19.434 --> 00:50:21.227
Tell it to the boss.

433
00:50:21.728 --> 00:50:23.938
He likes good hunting stories.

434
00:50:30.111 --> 00:50:33.865
Look at him with pride,
because he's looking at you.

435
00:50:35.742 --> 00:50:38.369
The whole country is looking at you.

436
00:50:47.337 --> 00:50:48.755
(Whinnying)

437
00:50:59.849 --> 00:51:01.059
(Gunshot)

438
00:51:01.142 --> 00:51:04.771
Forgive me, forgive me, grandfather.

439
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:41.975
So it's not the wolf that chooses
the hunting ground, but the hunter.

440
00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:49.440
And I'm sure your grandfather
taught you that.

441
00:51:53.444 --> 00:51:57.115
Except, in this case, I'm the game.

442
00:52:02.161 --> 00:52:07.292
Koulikov: However, today what we're going
to do is lure the wolf out of his lair

443
00:52:07.375 --> 00:52:09.502
to where we want him to be.

444
00:52:49.709 --> 00:52:52.754
You're the one whose life is valuable,
you go first.

445
00:52:52.837 --> 00:52:54.964
No. No. We take it in turns.

446
00:52:55.048 --> 00:52:59.052
Next time it's your turn to go first.
And then it's you, volodya.

447
00:53:03.598 --> 00:53:05.475
(Man yelling in German)

448
00:53:13.316 --> 00:53:14.609
(Yelling)

449
00:53:15.276 --> 00:53:16.944
Son of a bitch!

450
00:53:17.862 --> 00:53:19.113
(Yelling)

451
00:53:21.574 --> 00:53:26.245
These are new pants. I just took them
off a captain from the 251st yesterday.

452
00:53:31.292 --> 00:53:35.213
Sixteen months I spent in Germany
at the school in zossen.

453
00:53:35.296 --> 00:53:39.133
Of course, those were the days
when we were friends with the krauts.

454
00:53:39.217 --> 00:53:44.639
When our Joseph and their Adolf
were walking hand in hand.

455
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:50.561
From here to the wire,
160 meters, right?

456
00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:59.237
- Hundred and fifty-five.
- Whatever.

457
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.073
That'll make them send out a repair guy.

458
00:54:02.824 --> 00:54:04.409
Let's relocate.

459
00:54:13.543 --> 00:54:14.836
(Gasping)

460
00:54:25.847 --> 00:54:27.306
Hey, volodya.

461
00:54:37.859 --> 00:54:42.613
After the Germans invaded us, it wasn't
the same atmosphere anymore.

462
00:54:44.657 --> 00:54:46.951
They threw my arse in prison.

463
00:54:47.535 --> 00:54:50.204
"What were you doing in Germany?"

464
00:54:50.288 --> 00:54:54.542
"Excuse me," says I, "but it was
comrade Stalin who sent me there."

465
00:54:55.126 --> 00:54:59.046
"Don't bring our glorious leader
into your treachery.

466
00:54:59.714 --> 00:55:02.884
"Confess, spy bastard, confess."

467
00:55:02.967 --> 00:55:06.554
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

468
00:55:10.725 --> 00:55:13.978
Well, there wasn't a sickle,
but there was a hammer.

469
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:17.732
And bang, it knocked out all my teeth.

470
00:55:21.152 --> 00:55:24.071
That's right, boy, have no illusions.

471
00:55:24.197 --> 00:55:27.909
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

472
00:55:28.367 --> 00:55:29.744
(Clattering)

473
00:55:31.579 --> 00:55:34.040
Volodya: Hey, it's your repair guy.

474
00:55:36.542 --> 00:55:37.919
I got him.

475
00:55:52.558 --> 00:55:56.521
- It's about soup time, isn't it?
- I'm going.

476
00:55:56.938 --> 00:55:59.941
Koulikov: Well, get
a move on, volodya.

477
00:56:00.024 --> 00:56:04.028
And try not to spill it all
on your way back, you marxist bastard.

478
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.198
(Chattering)

479
00:56:17.792 --> 00:56:19.377
Here's the enemy sniper activity

480
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.629
reported during
the past 24 hours, major.

481
00:56:21.712 --> 00:56:23.047
(Explosion)

482
00:56:25.341 --> 00:56:28.010
Two sentries shot
in the train station sector,

483
00:56:28.135 --> 00:56:30.846
one artillery observer
in the northern sector,

484
00:56:30.972 --> 00:56:34.934
one lieutenant from the 24th panzer
division in the factory sector,

485
00:56:35.017 --> 00:56:38.104
three telephone repair men
in the workers' housing sector.

486
00:56:38.187 --> 00:56:42.483
They also tell me we've just taken
a prisoner who may interest you.

487
00:56:42.858 --> 00:56:46.153
- I hope he's still able to speak.
- Excuse me, sir?

488
00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:48.906
Nothing. Thank you.

489
00:56:51.993 --> 00:56:53.995
Konig: So tell us, volodya.

490
00:56:54.996 --> 00:56:56.998
Which building is he in?

491
00:57:00.001 --> 00:57:02.128
There is no way I know that.

492
00:57:03.838 --> 00:57:06.048
He moves around all the time.

493
00:57:06.382 --> 00:57:09.802
- He jumps from one to the next.
- On which floor?

494
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.056
- I don't know.
- We'll see about that.

495
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:17.768
Undress him.

496
00:57:18.936 --> 00:57:21.230
Put him in one of our uniforms.

497
00:57:23.649 --> 00:57:25.401
(Yelling in German)

498
00:57:32.408 --> 00:57:34.327
(Man yelling in German)

499
00:57:44.003 --> 00:57:45.921
(Man yelling in German)

500
00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:51.802
You see? They're stubborn.

501
00:57:53.179 --> 00:57:55.890
That's the good thing
about the Germans.

502
00:57:56.223 --> 00:58:00.061
Man, you got to admit,
when they get an idea in their heads...

503
00:58:15.618 --> 00:58:16.786
Right.

504
00:58:17.787 --> 00:58:21.082
- Let's see if our customer has arrived.
- You ready?

505
00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:24.377
Mmm-hmm.

506
00:58:25.169 --> 00:58:28.964
And now, our famous Shepherd
from the urals

507
00:58:29.048 --> 00:58:34.345
who major konig thinks is an idiot, gets
up to make sure he has hit his target.

508
00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:36.889
Major konig sees him,

509
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.062
aims for his helmet,

510
00:58:43.813 --> 00:58:47.525
fires, reveals his position,

511
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:49.944
and is shot in turn.

512
00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:04.500
Except major konig doesn't fire,

513
00:59:08.713 --> 00:59:10.923
because major konig isn't there.

514
00:59:15.177 --> 00:59:16.470
Koulikov?

515
00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:25.980
Don't you think that was strange?
That last one?

516
00:59:26.564 --> 00:59:29.567
They sent him out
to get shot like the others.

517
00:59:30.151 --> 00:59:31.777
It's not natural.

518
00:59:31.861 --> 00:59:34.947
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

519
00:59:37.408 --> 00:59:39.994
No. No, I'm the one who was stupid.

520
00:59:40.745 --> 00:59:43.080
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

521
00:59:43.164 --> 00:59:45.624
I mean, it's like us with the Ukrainians.

522
00:59:45.708 --> 00:59:49.003
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead grunts.

523
00:59:49.545 --> 00:59:53.257
Tomorrow, we'll kill us some generals.

524
01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:04.393
Whose turn is it?

525
01:00:05.686 --> 01:00:07.188
Mine, I think.

526
01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:10.483
You're such a cheater.

527
01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:17.865
You can't fool papa koulikov.
No, no, no. It's my turn to go first.

528
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.330
And it's your turn
to get a hole in your breeches.

529
01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:26.415
(Sighs)

530
01:00:30.419 --> 01:00:31.712
(Gunshot)

531
01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:35.883
(Cocks gun)

532
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.325
(Sobbing)

533
01:01:11.794 --> 01:01:13.128
(Mumbling)

534
01:01:39.947 --> 01:01:41.365
To victory.

535
01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:52.793
This sniper business
has been dragging on too long.

536
01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:56.797
What's that little fellow of yours up to?

537
01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:01.218
He's probing, comrade khrushchev.

538
01:02:01.302 --> 01:02:03.637
He's testing the German
for weaknesses.

539
01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.307
He's meticulous in his preparation.

540
01:02:08.434 --> 01:02:12.271
Vodka is a luxury we have.

541
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.650
Caviar is a luxury we have.

542
01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:18.444
Time is not.

543
01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:23.073
He's aware of that,
comrade khrushchev, we both are.

544
01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.161
I assure you he will succeed.

545
01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:32.499
Good. It seems your destinies
are entwined.

546
01:02:41.008 --> 01:02:42.384
(Murmuring)

547
01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.595
(Morse code beeping)

548
01:02:45.054 --> 01:02:46.597
(Radio static)

549
01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:50.517
(Man chattering indistinctly
on rad/o)

550
01:02:55.356 --> 01:02:57.024
They're keeping you busy?

551
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.991
I picked this up from the kitchen.
It's from the reception the other day.

552
01:03:06.075 --> 01:03:08.702
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

553
01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:10.621
(Chuckung)

554
01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:13.540
She'll be thrilled.
That's very sweet of you.

555
01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:16.210
There's plenty more if you're hungry.

556
01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:19.254
You're Jewish, aren't you?

557
01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.884
There's nothing in our religion
that says you can't eat sturgeon.

558
01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.972
My father had a premonition
all this would happen.

559
01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:30.474
You mean the war?

560
01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:34.311
He understood
that the hatred of the Jews ran deep.

561
01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:38.023
He was saving up
to buy some land in Palestine.

562
01:03:39.233 --> 01:03:42.695
He said it was the only land
that we truly belonged in.

563
01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:46.240
The only land we had a duty to defend.

564
01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:50.077
He insisted I learn to use a rifle.

565
01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:53.414
I learn to shoot.

566
01:03:57.668 --> 01:04:01.755
I know that in times of war
personal feelings should be put aside,

567
01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:06.760
- but I have a favor to ask you.
- Of course. Anything you want.

568
01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.763
I want to be reassigned.

569
01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.768
What's happened, Tania?

570
01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:17.146
(People singing in Russian)

571
01:04:40.002 --> 01:04:41.503
He shot him.

572
01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:48.510
He shot him even though
he jumped first.

573
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.056
Shot him on the run.

574
01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:56.477
It was an impossible shot.
I've never seen anything like it.

575
01:04:57.186 --> 01:05:00.355
You've promised people
a victory I can't deliver.

576
01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:05.027
I don't stand a chance against this man.

577
01:05:05.152 --> 01:05:07.696
You mustn't talk like that, vassili.

578
01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:12.576
Danilov: What if I told you we've found
a way to track his movements?

579
01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.870
We've got someone, vassili.

580
01:05:14.995 --> 01:05:17.915
Someone close to him
passing us information.

581
01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:20.918
Next time you will be
one step ahead of him.

582
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.588
I promise.

583
01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:31.804
(Chuckung)

584
01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:33.430
(Music playing)

585
01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:37.101
Now I have a favor to ask.

586
01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:39.520
From me?

587
01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:45.234
(Whispering) It's about Tania.

588
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.698
Come in.

589
01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.373
Vassili: He doesn't even
know you exist,

590
01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:03.043
but at that moment you're closer to him
than anyone else on earth.

591
01:06:03.127 --> 01:06:05.629
You see his face through the sight.

592
01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:08.757
You see whether
he shaved that morning or not.

593
01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:10.322
You can see whether he's married by,

594
01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:13.137
you know, whether
he has a wedding ring on.

595
01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:14.721
(Clock ticking)

596
01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:22.020
It's not like just firing at a distant shape.
It's not just a uniform. It's a man's face.

597
01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.774
Those faces don't go away.

598
01:06:27.234 --> 01:06:31.446
They come back
and they get replaced by more faces.

599
01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:35.450
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

600
01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:39.872
He likes you very much. I think
he'd try anything to change your mind.

601
01:06:39.955 --> 01:06:42.666
Did he tell you why
I asked for the transfer?

602
01:06:44.126 --> 01:06:47.087
This morning a list arrived
at headquarters.

603
01:06:47.588 --> 01:06:50.924
It was a list of civilians
who'd been rounded up

604
01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:55.262
and sent to Germany in a convoy
that left stalingrad three weeks ago.

605
01:06:57.306 --> 01:06:59.641
My parents were amongst them.

606
01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.395
After 30 kilometers,

607
01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:09.276
the German soldiers stopped the train
and forced everyone out.

608
01:07:12.112 --> 01:07:15.574
In the middle of a bridge,
they bound them together,

609
01:07:16.617 --> 01:07:18.076
two by two.

610
01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:21.580
Mothers with daughters.

611
01:07:22.122 --> 01:07:23.916
Husbands and wives.

612
01:07:26.168 --> 01:07:29.379
They lined them up against the railing.

613
01:07:30.339 --> 01:07:34.927
And then they fired a single shot
at each pair to save bullets.

614
01:07:36.887 --> 01:07:38.263
It worked.

615
01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:43.977
The bodies of the ones who died
dragged the others under the water.

616
01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.942
I know they died together.

617
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:54.321
They would never have let themselves
be separated.

618
01:08:09.253 --> 01:08:12.506
That's koulikov's rifle. It's a good rifle.

619
01:08:18.262 --> 01:08:19.680
(Sniffling)

620
01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.600
Thank you.

621
01:08:53.463 --> 01:08:58.010
I know how he leaves the shelter.
He goes through the tractor factory.

622
01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.554
The tractor factory is big.

623
01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.434
I know exactly where.

624
01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:09.438
He crawls through a gutter
under a grate where the vats are.

625
01:09:09.938 --> 01:09:12.482
Then he goes out from the workshop.

626
01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:14.943
In between the two
there's a place where he's in the open.

627
01:09:15.027 --> 01:09:17.529
It's under a long iron foot walk.

628
01:09:52.105 --> 01:09:53.857
Good luck, comrade.

629
01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:02.300
(Chattering)

630
01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:41.882
I know exactly
where he's waiting for me.

631
01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:49.681
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.
We'll take him out from behind.

632
01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:56.271
(Men yelling indistinctly)

633
01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:57.481
(Explosions)

634
01:11:57.564 --> 01:11:58.899
(Gunfire in the distance)

635
01:12:10.202 --> 01:12:14.748
We'll get to the other end of
the workshop through these pipes.

636
01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.042
Follow me.

637
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:51.368
(Clattering)

638
01:13:23.191 --> 01:13:24.568
(Clattering)

639
01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:06.192
(Whispering) You go that way.
I'll go around this way.

640
01:14:06.276 --> 01:14:07.527
Okay.

641
01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:23.376
(Soldier groaning)

642
01:14:25.003 --> 01:14:26.588
Shit!

643
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.637
(Groaning)

644
01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:37.932
- It's okay.
- You should go back.

645
01:14:38.016 --> 01:14:39.851
-No -go back.

646
01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.811
- I'll be all right.
- No, you go!

647
01:14:47.942 --> 01:14:49.694
Keep your legs in.

648
01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.858
(Shell hits floor)

649
01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:36.700
Come on. Come on. Come on.

650
01:16:00.807 --> 01:16:02.517
(Breathing heavily)

651
01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:07.063
(Airplan es passing overhead)

652
01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:39.763
Comrade Stalin is asking
for one last effort.

653
01:16:39.846 --> 01:16:41.765
The fate of the motherland is at risk.

654
01:16:41.848 --> 01:16:44.434
The fate of all those
you love and Cherish.

655
01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:46.519
It's for them that we fight today.

656
01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:52.484
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans
are throwing everything at us.

657
01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:55.945
If they're lucky, one in ten of these
soldiers will come back alive.

658
01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:58.615
You're highly educated.
You know languages.

659
01:16:58.698 --> 01:17:02.035
Every intercept you translate
saves hundreds of lives.

660
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.039
Every message you decode
kills thousands of theirs.

661
01:17:06.164 --> 01:17:08.458
You have a duty to survive.

662
01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:11.127
Vassili was born to fire a gun.
That's what he knows.

663
01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:14.214
You and I were born
for a different purpose.

664
01:17:15.215 --> 01:17:18.551
If vassili were here,
he would tell you the same thing.

665
01:17:21.346 --> 01:17:23.681
Where is he? Where's vassili?

666
01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:27.852
(Indistinct yelling)

667
01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.317
(Clattering)

668
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:33.209
Vassili: Keep your head down.

669
01:18:33.293 --> 01:18:35.211
- Tell me where he is.
- Stay into that pipe.

670
01:18:35.295 --> 01:18:38.214
Tania, stay in. Stay in. Get your head in.

671
01:18:45.972 --> 01:18:47.307
Slow down.

672
01:18:48.308 --> 01:18:49.809
Don't shoot.

673
01:18:55.982 --> 01:18:57.609
He's over there.

674
01:19:10.330 --> 01:19:13.833
You see the pillar in front of you?

675
01:19:15.335 --> 01:19:17.921
I need you to move round behind it.

676
01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:36.981
Tania, I need you to find
a large piece of glass.

677
01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:38.942
Piece of glass.

678
01:19:42.153 --> 01:19:44.656
You see the kiln?

679
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:49.202
Behind me, to the left of the factory.

680
01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:54.332
- Yes? I can't hear you.
- Yes.

681
01:19:54.415 --> 01:19:55.708
Yes.

682
01:19:56.668 --> 01:20:01.422
Do you see the two louvers?

683
01:20:02.882 --> 01:20:03.925
Yes.

684
01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:07.929
Do you see the one
with the broken slat?

685
01:20:09.389 --> 01:20:12.850
- Yes.
- This is what I want you to do.

686
01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:22.735
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

687
01:20:23.695 --> 01:20:26.447
Three, two, one.

688
01:20:33.913 --> 01:20:35.248
(Groaning)

689
01:20:46.134 --> 01:20:47.719
Hello, sacha.

690
01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:57.270
He was right where you said he'd be.

691
01:20:58.271 --> 01:20:59.772
Nearly there.

692
01:21:03.818 --> 01:21:05.486
He's very clever.

693
01:21:10.742 --> 01:21:12.410
Tell me about him.

694
01:21:19.167 --> 01:21:23.671
Why was it his grandfather who taught
him how to shoot and not his father?

695
01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:26.591
His father's dead. His mother, too.

696
01:21:30.595 --> 01:21:34.307
- Does he talk about his father?
- No, he didn't know him.

697
01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:38.978
Did he go to school?

698
01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:42.607
He knows how to write.
He answers lots of letters.

699
01:21:44.484 --> 01:21:48.154
- Is it girls who write to him?
- Everyone writes to him.

700
01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:50.782
And is there a girl
he loves in his village?

701
01:21:50.865 --> 01:21:53.868
- Not in his village. Here!
- Does she love him?

702
01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:58.539
Yes. Because he's handsome,
because he's brave.

703
01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:00.875
And she's very beautiful.

704
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.127
I know her well.
She's from my neighborhood.

705
01:22:03.211 --> 01:22:06.756
She went to the university.
They are handsome together.

706
01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:09.550
Later the two of them will get married.

707
01:22:14.722 --> 01:22:16.516
At least, I think so.

708
01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:23.689
And you, sacha,
why are you helping the Germans?

709
01:22:27.902 --> 01:22:31.614
Because they're stronger.
Because they're going to win the war.

710
01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:34.033
And because you like chocolate.

711
01:22:36.577 --> 01:22:38.121
(Music playing)

712
01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:54.095
Vassili: All these people here
know they're gonna die,

713
01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:58.683
so each night
when they make it back, it's a bonus.

714
01:22:58.766 --> 01:23:00.101
(Coughing)

715
01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:01.686
Excuse me!

716
01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:02.937
(Laughing)

717
01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:06.482
So every cup of tea, every cigarette,

718
01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:10.778
becomes a little celebration.

719
01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:14.073
Because for a lot of us,
it may be our last night.

720
01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:18.578
It's just something
you have to accept here.

721
01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:22.081
Everyone has their time.

722
01:23:25.585 --> 01:23:29.755
In the forest,
the wolf lives for three years,

723
01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:32.258
the donkey for nine.

724
01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:38.973
Sorry, but that's got to be
a proverb from the urals.

725
01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:41.100
It makes no sense to me whatsoever!

726
01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.478
The donkey lives longer
because he's more useful.

727
01:23:45.438 --> 01:23:46.480
It makes absolute sense.

728
01:23:46.606 --> 01:23:50.067
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.
You made it up.

729
01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:56.866
I'm a donkey.

730
01:24:00.161 --> 01:24:05.249
People like you and Danilov
have to survive this.

731
01:24:05.333 --> 01:24:08.294
People who've read books,
had an education.

732
01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:14.300
- We'll need you when the war's over.
- Tania: And if you survive?

733
01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:18.971
What will the useless
vassili zaitsev do then?

734
01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.974
Vassili: I want to work in a factory.

735
01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:25.811
My grandad took me to a factory once.

736
01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:33.319
There was this man there
high up on a foot walk.

737
01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.573
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.

738
01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:41.369
The people he was supervising over,
they didn't really understand

739
01:24:41.494 --> 01:24:44.372
what they were doing,
but for him up there

740
01:24:44.497 --> 01:24:46.624
it was simple, it was clear.

741
01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:51.837
And I thought,
"one day, I could be that man."

742
01:24:58.344 --> 01:25:01.347
Sad to have a dream
you know won't happen.

743
01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.351
Why shouldn't it?

744
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.897
You'll outlive us all.

745
01:25:09.981 --> 01:25:11.023
Mmm.

746
01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:14.902
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.

747
01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:34.880
One hundred and fifty meters stand
between the Germans and the volga.

748
01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:36.942
Today the whole world is watching
these 150 meters.

749
01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:40.469
They are
what make stalingrad the capital

750
01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:43.973
of the war.

751
01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:51.230
Your friend, Tania.

752
01:25:53.399 --> 01:25:55.234
Have you seen her?

753
01:25:55.568 --> 01:25:58.362
She stays over there now
with the snipers.

754
01:25:59.405 --> 01:26:01.425
Tell the major we're sending in
all our sharpshooters

755
01:26:01.449 --> 01:26:04.118
to support the attack on the factory.

756
01:26:07.455 --> 01:26:09.790
Tell him vassili will be there.

757
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:12.001
(Raining)

758
01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:15.838
(Men snoring)

759
01:26:19.759 --> 01:26:21.260
(Man coughing)

760
01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:32.289
(Both breathing heavily)

761
01:27:40.798 --> 01:27:42.383
(Woman coughing)

762
01:28:42.318 --> 01:28:43.611
(Moaning)

763
01:28:58.709 --> 01:29:00.336
(Muffled moaning)

764
01:29:44.296 --> 01:29:45.673
(Coughing)

765
01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:50.886
(Explosions)

766
01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:52.513
(Gunfire in the distance)

767
01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:02.606
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.

768
01:30:07.528 --> 01:30:09.029
- Danilov.
- Hmm?

769
01:30:22.126 --> 01:30:24.587
You have to stop writing about me.

770
01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:30.843
I'm not gonna get him
because I'm not good enough.

771
01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:34.388
Sooner or later he's gonna find me,
he's gonna kill me.

772
01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:37.558
I've warned you before
not to talk like this.

773
01:30:37.808 --> 01:30:39.226
(Stammers)

774
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:41.395
This time it's different.

775
01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:49.278
You've built me up and up
into someone I'm not.

776
01:30:51.322 --> 01:30:54.575
I can't carry that weight anymore.
I want to fight.

777
01:30:55.701 --> 01:30:59.455
I want to fightjust as a regular soldier.

778
01:31:00.581 --> 01:31:02.207
I understand.

779
01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:04.710
The thing is, vassili,
you're not a regular soldier,

780
01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:08.589
- you're an extraordinary soldier.
- No. I'm what you've made me.

781
01:31:10.132 --> 01:31:11.592
Nothing more.

782
01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.266
Why are you telling me this now?

783
01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.435
Hmm? What's happened?

784
01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:27.691
What's changed?

785
01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:34.657
Did you speak to Tania for me?

786
01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:38.327
Yes.

787
01:31:38.661 --> 01:31:41.205
Well, will she reconsider?

788
01:31:45.042 --> 01:31:46.502
I don't know.

789
01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.133
She should. She'll be much safer.
She should. You know that.

790
01:31:53.217 --> 01:31:54.259
Yeah.

791
01:31:54.343 --> 01:31:57.221
It'll be easier to get her reassigned
than you.

792
01:31:57.304 --> 01:32:00.075
You see, the Germans are preparing
another offensive in the city centre.

793
01:32:00.099 --> 01:32:02.267
The propaganda battle's crucial
for morale.

794
01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:05.562
We need you more than ever.
Sacha? Hold on. Sacha?

795
01:32:10.484 --> 01:32:13.487
- Tell him what you know, sacha.
- Hello, sacha.

796
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.447
There was dust on the major's boots.

797
01:32:15.531 --> 01:32:19.451
Sacha has the major convinced
he's gone over to the other side.

798
01:32:20.077 --> 01:32:22.996
I don't need to tell you
the risks he's taking.

799
01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.373
The dust was yellow.

800
01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:26.709
There's only one place
where there's dust like that.

801
01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:30.796
In the back of the chemical factory,
a big heap along the tracks.

802
01:32:32.923 --> 01:32:34.258
Well done.

803
01:32:34.925 --> 01:32:37.970
Sacha, wait for me outside then.

804
01:32:45.936 --> 01:32:47.521
- Danilov...
- Hmm?

805
01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:51.608
You had no right to use him.

806
01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:57.656
No, I didn't use him, vassili.
He did it of his own accord.

807
01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:02.202
Do you know why?
Because he believes in you!

808
01:33:10.085 --> 01:33:13.756
Tomorrow morning, we're gonna
take back the chemical factory.

809
01:33:13.839 --> 01:33:16.759
Sacha has informed the major
you'll be there.

810
01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:19.762
So now you know
where you have to wait for him.

811
01:33:19.845 --> 01:33:23.182
- In the middle of an assault.
- I'm following orders.

812
01:33:23.265 --> 01:33:25.309
I suggest you do the same.

813
01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:31.023
Now, I'm aware of the risks.
You'll be fine.

814
01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:38.530
Comrade.

815
01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:09.144
That's the Germans up there.
Yesterday, it was the Russians.

816
01:34:09.228 --> 01:34:11.104
We're not very far now.

817
01:34:13.482 --> 01:34:14.733
Sacha,

818
01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.946
you're playing a very dangerous game.

819
01:34:20.072 --> 01:34:21.740
I want you to win.

820
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.036
See there? Keep going along the river.

821
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.497
It's safe for a while.

822
01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:44.096
(Explosions in distance)

823
01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:06.702
(Vassili spitting)

824
01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:00.964
(Sighing)

825
01:36:21.443 --> 01:36:23.695
(Man gives command in German)

826
01:36:45.092 --> 01:36:46.385
(Gasping)

827
01:36:55.477 --> 01:36:56.728
(Gunfire)

828
01:37:05.028 --> 01:37:06.697
(Whistle blowing)

829
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:11.743
(Indistinct yelling)

830
01:38:39.831 --> 01:38:41.124
(Yelling)

831
01:38:44.461 --> 01:38:45.712
(Yelling)

832
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.731
(Sighing)

833
01:39:06.775 --> 01:39:07.815
(Dogs barking in distance)

834
01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:09.194
He's dead.

835
01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:12.364
We found this on his corpse.

836
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:18.036
Your reason for being here
has ceased to exist.

837
01:39:18.829 --> 01:39:20.831
Pardon me, herr general.

838
01:39:22.165 --> 01:39:23.291
But I do not believe...

839
01:39:23.375 --> 01:39:27.587
There's a plane bound for Berlin
tomorrow evening. You will be on it.

840
01:39:31.383 --> 01:39:34.344
Until then I must ask you
for your dog tags.

841
01:39:36.471 --> 01:39:40.100
Imagine how Russian propaganda
would profit from your death.

842
01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:42.686
If you fail, you will fall unknown.

843
01:39:43.061 --> 01:39:45.397
You've already had a near miss.

844
01:39:54.281 --> 01:39:57.200
Also, please take this war merit cross.

845
01:39:57.284 --> 01:39:59.202
It was awarded posthumously
to a lieutenant

846
01:39:59.286 --> 01:40:00.954
of the 116th infantry division,

847
01:40:01.037 --> 01:40:04.416
who fell here
during the first days of the battle.

848
01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:07.627
He was my son.

849
01:40:10.422 --> 01:40:13.508
If the landing is captured,
everything's lost.

850
01:40:13.758 --> 01:40:15.635
(Man speaking Russian)

851
01:40:16.094 --> 01:40:17.470
Come here.

852
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:20.599
(Men chattering in Russian)

853
01:40:21.141 --> 01:40:22.934
What did I tell you?

854
01:40:23.018 --> 01:40:25.687
You've been playing your fiddle
too much.

855
01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:28.940
If it's confirmed that he's dead,
we're sunk.

856
01:40:29.566 --> 01:40:32.110
- Well, you're sunk.
- It isn't true.

857
01:40:32.402 --> 01:40:35.197
It was intercepted
from their staff headquarters.

858
01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.950
What do they have to do?
Dangle his body in front of our men?

859
01:40:39.034 --> 01:40:40.577
They're lying.

860
01:40:41.453 --> 01:40:42.871
That's good.

861
01:40:43.205 --> 01:40:44.581
Very good.

862
01:40:45.749 --> 01:40:49.294
Write it then.
Vassili zaitsev is not dead!

863
01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:51.838
This is what he had for breakfast
this morning.

864
01:40:51.922 --> 01:40:55.091
This is a picture of him
reading today's newspaper.

865
01:40:55.175 --> 01:40:56.760
You're the poet.

866
01:40:56.843 --> 01:41:00.263
What? You won't give up the riverbank.

867
01:41:01.139 --> 01:41:04.226
I don't care if you've lost half your men.

868
01:41:04.309 --> 01:41:06.937
Lose the other half or lose yourself!

869
01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:14.986
Is he back?

870
01:41:18.365 --> 01:41:20.325
He should be back soon.

871
01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:24.371
The German attack cut the lines,
that's why he's late.

872
01:41:27.791 --> 01:41:29.459
Can we go outside?

873
01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:33.129
(Distant gunfire)

874
01:41:33.213 --> 01:41:34.339
(Explosions)

875
01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:38.134
I wrote to my mother about you.

876
01:41:38.718 --> 01:41:40.780
She wanted me to tell you
that once this war was over,

877
01:41:40.804 --> 01:41:42.931
if there's anything you needed,
anything at all,

878
01:41:43.014 --> 01:41:45.517
our family will be there for you.

879
01:41:47.727 --> 01:41:49.813
You know I'm here for you.

880
01:41:49.896 --> 01:41:52.107
(Man speaking German on P.A.)

881
01:41:54.818 --> 01:41:56.736
They're saying vassili is dead.

882
01:41:57.028 --> 01:42:00.573
Man on P.A.: Vassili zaitsev will never
see his loved ones again.

883
01:42:01.366 --> 01:42:04.661
Surrender. This is your only hope.

884
01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.542
You're upset?

885
01:42:12.502 --> 01:42:14.462
Because zaitsev is dead?

886
01:42:16.673 --> 01:42:19.884
You don't have to hide it.
There's no shame in it.

887
01:42:20.677 --> 01:42:22.721
You're Russian like he is.

888
01:42:25.807 --> 01:42:27.726
Don't listen to them.

889
01:42:28.393 --> 01:42:30.186
It's just propaganda.

890
01:42:31.479 --> 01:42:33.023
He isn't dead.

891
01:42:34.566 --> 01:42:36.359
And do you know why?

892
01:42:37.819 --> 01:42:40.238
Because I haven't killed him yet.

893
01:42:43.158 --> 01:42:45.076
(Music playing on P.A.)

894
01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:50.165
I'm going to tell you a little secret.

895
01:42:50.248 --> 01:42:53.126
Only you,
because I know I can trust you.

896
01:42:54.044 --> 01:42:57.839
But you must swear to me
that you won't tell another soul.

897
01:42:59.841 --> 01:43:01.217
You swear?

898
01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:04.971
I found a terrific spot.

899
01:43:05.722 --> 01:43:08.433
It's by the exit from the train station.

900
01:43:08.892 --> 01:43:11.186
I'll hide in the water tower.

901
01:43:11.686 --> 01:43:14.147
Tomorrow I'll wait for him there.

902
01:43:15.231 --> 01:43:17.942
You'll see. He'll be there.

903
01:43:19.903 --> 01:43:21.488
He always is.

904
01:43:23.073 --> 01:43:24.449
(Chuckles)

905
01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:33.124
I also want you to swear to me

906
01:43:33.208 --> 01:43:36.336
that from now on you'll stay home
where you belong.

907
01:43:37.003 --> 01:43:38.546
Do you swear?

908
01:43:39.839 --> 01:43:41.049
Yes?

909
01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:45.887
Good.

910
01:43:46.805 --> 01:43:48.890
We know he's alive,
we know he won't fail us,

911
01:43:48.973 --> 01:43:50.809
we know because
he is a part of us now.

912
01:43:50.892 --> 01:43:52.727
Vassili is eternal.

913
01:43:55.397 --> 01:43:58.858
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere for you.

914
01:43:58.983 --> 01:44:02.487
Oh, didn't you hear? I was dead.

915
01:44:02.779 --> 01:44:06.366
At least, noble sniper zaitsev

916
01:44:08.785 --> 01:44:10.703
vassili was dead.

917
01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:13.206
The real one.

918
01:44:19.087 --> 01:44:22.715
I was asleep. And I missed my chance.

919
01:44:23.216 --> 01:44:26.344
Then I was curled up in a corner hiding

920
01:44:28.304 --> 01:44:30.682
from a man who wants to kill me.

921
01:44:31.141 --> 01:44:33.101
I'll talk to khrushchev.

922
01:44:33.476 --> 01:44:36.396
He'll send you back to your old division.

923
01:44:36.729 --> 01:44:39.482
- Where's Tania?
- She's at the shelter.

924
01:44:40.316 --> 01:44:43.987
- I've been to the shelter.
- Sacha: I told her you weren't dead.

925
01:44:46.614 --> 01:44:50.160
The major said so.
He said the other Germans were lying.

926
01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.913
He told me you were waiting for him
at the station.

927
01:44:57.083 --> 01:44:58.418
Vassili.

928
01:45:19.314 --> 01:45:20.773
(Whispering) Vassili.

929
01:45:23.151 --> 01:45:24.611
Vassili.

930
01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:33.411
My little sacha.

931
01:45:34.954 --> 01:45:36.289
I knew it.

932
01:45:46.341 --> 01:45:48.009
(Breathing heavily)

933
01:45:54.933 --> 01:45:56.601
- Vassili.
- Tania.

934
01:46:03.608 --> 01:46:05.610
I knew you weren't dead.

935
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:10.281
- How?
- Because we've only just met.

936
01:46:14.869 --> 01:46:18.581
I prayed for the first time
since I was a little girl.

937
01:46:20.291 --> 01:46:23.419
When I opened my eyes,
sacha was standing there

938
01:46:23.503 --> 01:46:25.964
waiting to give me the good news.

939
01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.594
I think he loves you even more than I do.

940
01:46:56.035 --> 01:46:58.413
Danilov: (Dictating) To the proper
military authority.

941
01:46:58.496 --> 01:47:00.099
I'm calling to
the commandant's attention,

942
01:47:00.123 --> 01:47:02.083
the recent changes noticed
in the attitude

943
01:47:02.166 --> 01:47:05.962
towards fighting
of soldier, vassili zaitsev.

944
01:47:06.045 --> 01:47:09.591
He has attempted, on several
occasions, to escape his duties,

945
01:47:09.674 --> 01:47:12.051
voiced doubts
on the chances of our victory,

946
01:47:12.135 --> 01:47:14.762
and made defeatist comments in public.

947
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:20.268
The inexplicable duration of his due!
With a Nazi sharpshooter

948
01:47:20.685 --> 01:47:25.898
can only be explained by his lack
of belief in the communist ideal.

949
01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:29.152
(Breathing heavily)

950
01:47:34.157 --> 01:47:35.908
Good morning, sacha.

951
01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:41.331
Once again,
he knew exactly where to find me.

952
01:47:42.081 --> 01:47:44.459
Don't you think that's strange?

953
01:47:45.418 --> 01:47:47.754
Apart from me, only you knew.

954
01:47:47.837 --> 01:47:49.380
(Sacha sobbing)

955
01:47:49.839 --> 01:47:54.135
I don't hold it against you, sacha.
You've done a very brave thing.

956
01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:58.431
You've chosen your camp.
I respect that.

957
01:47:58.765 --> 01:48:00.600
But it isn't my camp.

958
01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.935
We're both soldiers.

959
01:48:03.686 --> 01:48:07.357
We're both enemies,
so I know you understand.

960
01:48:08.608 --> 01:48:10.008
I'm annoyed with you, little sacha,

961
01:48:10.068 --> 01:48:13.321
for not staying at home
as I made you swear to do.

962
01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:18.326
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me
to do what I'm going to have to do.

963
01:48:18.409 --> 01:48:19.744
(Sobbing)

964
01:48:22.955 --> 01:48:26.250
I've never seen anyone frown
so much in their sleep.

965
01:48:30.213 --> 01:48:33.508
- How long have you been watching me?
- All night.

966
01:48:35.343 --> 01:48:38.137
You've been snoring away happily
for hours.

967
01:48:38.221 --> 01:48:40.473
I don't snore, do I?

968
01:48:41.265 --> 01:48:42.767
Like a pig!

969
01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:46.854
- I suppose I talk in my sleep as well?
- Yes.

970
01:48:49.857 --> 01:48:52.485
There's something I should tell you.

971
01:48:59.617 --> 01:49:03.413
On the train coming here,

972
01:49:06.582 --> 01:49:08.292
we were in the same car.

973
01:49:10.253 --> 01:49:11.629
I saw you.

974
01:49:12.797 --> 01:49:15.758
You were reading and you fell asleep.

975
01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:22.098
I didn't dare look at you,
you were so beautiful.

976
01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:25.685
You were scary.

977
01:49:28.813 --> 01:49:31.983
Aftennards, I couldn't stop thinking
about you.

978
01:49:33.067 --> 01:49:34.777
It made me smile.

979
01:49:36.279 --> 01:49:40.450
And then I thought of all the men
who would get to hold you,

980
01:49:43.244 --> 01:49:45.121
who'd make you laugh,

981
01:49:47.749 --> 01:49:49.625
how lucky they were.

982
01:49:53.254 --> 01:49:56.007
And now I'm the one lying next to you.

983
01:49:58.843 --> 01:50:01.512
- Was I snoring?
- Like a pig.

984
01:50:33.044 --> 01:50:34.378
(Gasping)

985
01:50:35.046 --> 01:50:36.255
What?

986
01:50:37.131 --> 01:50:38.382
(Gasping)

987
01:50:39.509 --> 01:50:41.427
Oh, my god!

988
01:50:43.304 --> 01:50:44.680
Tania, no.

989
01:50:44.764 --> 01:50:46.766
- No, get off me!
- Tania, no.

990
01:50:46.849 --> 01:50:48.768
- Get off me!
- It's what he wants.

991
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:50.728
- Get off me!
- This is what he wants.

992
01:50:50.812 --> 01:50:53.272
- Get off me!
- No. He'll kill you.

993
01:50:53.356 --> 01:50:54.690
- Let me go!
- He'll kill you,

994
01:50:54.774 --> 01:50:56.335
- and then I'll run after you...
- Let me go!

995
01:50:56.359 --> 01:50:58.319
- And he'll kill me, too.
- Let me go!

996
01:50:58.402 --> 01:51:02.532
This is what he wants. I'll get him.
I promise I'll get him.

997
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:04.033
(Sobbing)

998
01:51:04.116 --> 01:51:07.119
I'll get his rifle for
you, I promise, Tania.

999
01:51:07.745 --> 01:51:08.745
(Gunfire)

1000
01:51:08.788 --> 01:51:09.914
(Explosions)

1001
01:51:11.457 --> 01:51:13.459
(Man yelling indistinctly)

1002
01:51:20.258 --> 01:51:22.260
(Man yelling indistinctly)

1003
01:51:26.097 --> 01:51:27.431
(Panting)

1004
01:51:27.849 --> 01:51:29.225
I need you.

1005
01:51:29.809 --> 01:51:31.477
(Knocking at door)

1006
01:51:32.937 --> 01:51:36.190
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov.
Stalingrad may fall.

1007
01:51:36.274 --> 01:51:38.877
The last of the boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.

1008
01:51:38.901 --> 01:51:42.071
He's brought you a pass.
You'll be safe on the other side.

1009
01:51:42.154 --> 01:51:43.298
You have to gather your things,

1010
01:51:43.322 --> 01:51:45.092
and we'll help you carry them
to the landing stage.

1011
01:51:45.116 --> 01:51:51.747
I'm not leaving. This is my home.
This is my sacha's home. I can't leave.

1012
01:51:51.831 --> 01:51:54.709
I have to tell you something,
Mrs. Filipov.

1013
01:51:54.792 --> 01:51:56.544
(Breathing heavily)

1014
01:51:56.878 --> 01:51:59.589
Something very difficult to understand.

1015
01:52:00.631 --> 01:52:02.341
It's about sacha.

1016
01:52:16.397 --> 01:52:19.150
He's gone over to the Germans.
He's betrayed his country.

1017
01:52:19.233 --> 01:52:22.361
He's with the enemy now.
He won't be coming back.

1018
01:52:24.238 --> 01:52:25.740
Oh, my god.

1019
01:52:29.994 --> 01:52:31.537
Oh, my god.

1020
01:52:33.998 --> 01:52:35.958
He's become a traitor.

1021
01:52:37.710 --> 01:52:39.629
The poor little thing.

1022
01:52:40.796 --> 01:52:42.548
What has he done?

1023
01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:48.679
So he's going to stay over there?

1024
01:52:53.476 --> 01:52:56.896
Yes. He's going to stay over there.

1025
01:52:59.482 --> 01:53:01.842
Mrs. Filipov: I shouldn't be
saying this, comrade commissar,

1026
01:53:01.901 --> 01:53:04.153
but maybe it's for the best.

1027
01:53:05.071 --> 01:53:07.448
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.

1028
01:53:07.531 --> 01:53:11.285
I know it's wrong,
but perhaps he's made the right choice.

1029
01:53:14.538 --> 01:53:16.540
(Mrs. Filipov screaming)

1030
01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:31.681
(Mrs. Filipov screaming)

1031
01:53:31.764 --> 01:53:33.599
Mrs. Filipov: Tania!
Danilov: Tania!

1032
01:53:34.767 --> 01:53:36.936
Mrs. Filipov: Oh, Tania!
Danilov: Tania!

1033
01:53:38.562 --> 01:53:40.481
(Mrs. Filipov sobbing)

1034
01:53:57.873 --> 01:54:01.335
I need a doctor. A doctor!

1035
01:54:06.507 --> 01:54:10.636
I have a pass. I have a pass.
You must let her cross.

1036
01:54:14.724 --> 01:54:15.975
Please.

1037
01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:18.030
- It's useless. She'll never make it.
- No.

1038
01:54:18.102 --> 01:54:24.150
No, she will. She's my daughter.
She's my daughter, I beg of you.

1039
01:54:24.233 --> 01:54:28.654
All right. All right, you two,
put this one on the boat.

1040
01:55:06.609 --> 01:55:07.943
(Rustling)

1041
01:55:12.364 --> 01:55:14.158
(Breathing heavily)

1042
01:55:16.911 --> 01:55:20.247
Where is he? Where's the major?

1043
01:55:20.706 --> 01:55:22.917
A few inches from your face.

1044
01:55:25.586 --> 01:55:27.922
I've been such a fool, vassili.

1045
01:55:30.007 --> 01:55:32.009
Man will always be man.

1046
01:55:33.010 --> 01:55:34.887
There is no new man.

1047
01:55:36.514 --> 01:55:39.725
We tried so hard to create
a society that was equal,

1048
01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:43.062
where there'd be nothing
to envy your neighbor.

1049
01:55:43.854 --> 01:55:46.565
But there's always something to envy.

1050
01:55:47.942 --> 01:55:51.403
A smile, a friendship.

1051
01:55:53.364 --> 01:55:56.700
Something you don't have
and want to appropriate.

1052
01:55:57.535 --> 01:56:00.788
In this world, even a Soviet one,

1053
01:56:02.039 --> 01:56:04.583
there will always be rich and poor.

1054
01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:07.795
Rich in gifts,

1055
01:56:09.630 --> 01:56:11.382
poor in gifts.

1056
01:56:12.633 --> 01:56:14.135
Rich in love,

1057
01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:17.721
poor in love.

1058
01:56:24.061 --> 01:56:26.063
Tania isn't coming back.

1059
01:56:28.232 --> 01:56:30.067
She's dead, vassili.

1060
01:56:38.993 --> 01:56:41.245
She was cut down by shrapnel.

1061
01:56:41.328 --> 01:56:45.082
It was quick.
I don't think she even saw it coming.

1062
01:56:46.959 --> 01:56:48.836
She was on her way back to you,

1063
01:56:48.919 --> 01:56:52.131
as soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov
to the boats.

1064
01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:55.759
She was coming back for you.
She was right.

1065
01:56:56.927 --> 01:56:59.096
You're a good man, vassili.

1066
01:57:00.222 --> 01:57:01.473
(Sobbing)

1067
01:57:03.309 --> 01:57:07.396
I want to help you, vassili.
Let me do one last thing.

1068
01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:10.816
Something useful for a change.

1069
01:57:17.031 --> 01:57:21.619
- Let me show you where the major is.
- No, don't do that. Don't do that!

1070
01:57:44.391 --> 01:57:45.935
(Cocks rifle)

1071
02:00:14.041 --> 02:00:15.501
(Cocks rifle)

1072
02:00:15.584 --> 02:00:16.627
(Shell hits ground)

1073
02:01:35.873 --> 02:01:40.878
Man on pa: Today, February the 3rd,
1943, is an ominous day for Hitler

1074
02:01:40.961 --> 02:01:45.382
and the endless columns of hundreds
of thousands of German prisoners.

1075
02:01:45.466 --> 02:01:49.261
It is an unforgettable day of hope
for our motherland,

1076
02:01:49.386 --> 02:01:52.389
for the people of
the Soviet union, and...

1077
02:01:52.473 --> 02:01:54.391
(Man on P.A. continues
chattering indistinctly)

1078
02:01:54.475 --> 02:01:56.018
(Music playing)

1079
02:02:01.565 --> 02:02:06.153
Man on pa: Today after 180 days
of growing combat

1080
02:02:06.236 --> 02:02:08.405
in the martyred city of stalingrad,

1081
02:02:08.489 --> 02:02:13.702
and as a result of the valor
and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,

1082
02:02:13.785 --> 02:02:16.955
the commander
of our glorious red army

1083
02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:22.753
received the unconditional surrender
of the German fascist invasion.

1084
02:02:24.213 --> 02:02:27.341
(Man on P.A. continues
chattering indistinctly)

1085
02:02:38.936 --> 02:02:41.021
I cannot find the matching name
in the book.

1086
02:02:41.104 --> 02:02:43.857
Could you check again, please?
This is the address of this hospital

1087
02:02:43.941 --> 02:02:45.293
- and this is her name.
- She's not here, comrade.

1088
02:02:45.317 --> 02:02:46.568
Yes. This is our address,

1089
02:02:46.652 --> 02:02:49.863
- but she's not here.
- We don't have her anymore.

1090
02:02:49.947 --> 02:02:51.216
This is the address of this place...

1091
02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:52.759
- I'm so sorry.
- So she's obviously been here.

1092
02:02:52.783 --> 02:02:54.385
- She wrote to me.
- Three times in the books,

1093
02:02:54.409 --> 02:02:55.702
but she's not here.

1094
02:02:55.786 --> 02:03:01.291
Believe me. There is no
Tania chernova. I can't help you.
