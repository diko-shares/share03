00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:38.617
Dolly'll never go away

2
00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:43.283
Dolly'll never go away
again

3
00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:48.742
Hey, do you guys
know this one?

4
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.075
Oh!

5
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.992
Now this is the real shit.

6
00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.533
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.200
Shake your ass,
watch yourself

8
00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:02.783
Shake your ass

9
00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:04.283
Show me what
you're working with

10
00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.325
Attention all
young players and pimps

11
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.575
Right now
is the place to be

12
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.450
I thought I told
y'all niggers before

13
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.492
Y'all niggers
don't fuck with me

14
00:01:13.617 --> 00:01:15.117
Shake your ass

15
00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:16.242
Watch yourself

16
00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:17.658
Shake your ass

17
00:01:17.783 --> 00:01:18.867
Show me what
you're working with

18
00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:20.158
Shake your ass

19
00:01:23.492 --> 00:01:25.450
You suck.

20
00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:30.867
- Uh!
- Uh!

21
00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:38.658
Oh!

22
00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:41.700
Who put the horse out?

23
00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:51.867
She's good.

24
00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:58.742
She-she's been really sick.

25
00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:03.200
Bad, bad, bad girl!

26
00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:12.908
OK. That'll be $17.50.

27
00:02:12.992 --> 00:02:15.033
Hey, buddy!
Hey, pay the fare.

28
00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:21.325
I'm Father McFeely.

29
00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:22.742
I'm so glad you're here.

30
00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:24.867
I came as fast as I could,
but at my age...

31
00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:26.950
the little soldier needs
a lot more thumping...

32
00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:28.950
before it starts pumping,
if you know what I mean.

33
00:02:29.075 --> 00:02:30.742
I do find, though,
if I tickle my asshole...

34
00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:33.117
just before I unleash
the dog of war-

35
00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:34.492
It's OK. I understand.

36
00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:36.450
You know,
because in the old days...

37
00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:38.033
you know when you-

38
00:02:40.117 --> 00:02:41.533
How is she?

39
00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:43.867
It's gotten worse, Father.

40
00:02:43.992 --> 00:02:46.367
Really?

41
00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:49.408
She won't eat,
she won't talk.

42
00:02:50.658 --> 00:02:53.450
The child won't even
let me touch her.

43
00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:57.033
Yes. Sometimes you have
to give them candy.

44
00:02:57.158 --> 00:02:58.325
Father...

45
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.825
the church sent me
to assist you.

46
00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:02.950
I'm Father Harris.

47
00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:04.950
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

48
00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:07.450
Would you like
to see the girl?

49
00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:09.742
Soon...

50
00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:12.325
but first
I must bless this house.

51
00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:32.367
"The sorrows of death
compassed me...

52
00:03:32.492 --> 00:03:34.700
"and the pains of Hell
got hold upon me.

53
00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:35.908
"I found... "

54
00:03:38.283 --> 00:03:41.075
"Then called I upon
the name of the Lord and... "

55
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.700
"My soul from death. "

56
00:03:57.825 --> 00:04:00.200
Oh, God. Please, Lord.

57
00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:03.700
Help me to release
this demon.

58
00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:08.158
Ahh!

59
00:04:08.242 --> 00:04:11.992
Thank you, Lord,
the most merciful Almighty.

60
00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:13.242
Oh, hold on.

61
00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:19.242
Ahh!
Ah, those enchiladas.

62
00:04:19.408 --> 00:04:21.242
Ha, ha, ha!

63
00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:24.158
Thank you, Lord.

64
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.825
Aah!

65
00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.450
Fuck this.

66
00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:47.908
Father!

67
00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:49.783
Fuck! Did you see this?
Look at this!

68
00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:51.492
Please, Father,
think of the child.

69
00:04:51.617 --> 00:04:52.533
Fuck!

70
00:04:52.617 --> 00:04:53.867
Yes.

71
00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:02.867
It's freezing.

72
00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:22.492
Let us pray.

73
00:05:22.617 --> 00:05:24.992
"Defender of the human race...

74
00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:27.867
"look down in pity upon this,
your servant. "

75
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.242
Shove it up your ass,
you worthless piece of shit.

76
00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:31.950
Aah!

77
00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:33.742
Silence!

78
00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:34.783
Mmm.

79
00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.117
"Holy Lord-"

80
00:05:36.242 --> 00:05:38.992
Your mother is in here
with us, Harris.

81
00:05:39.075 --> 00:05:39.992
Would you like
to leave a message?

82
00:05:40.117 --> 00:05:41.742
I'll be sure that she gets it.

83
00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:44.658
Yes. Mom, will you
get out of there, please?

84
00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:47.825
You're no fun.

85
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.367
I'm working.

86
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.492
See you later,
Mrs. Harris.

87
00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:54.075
"Holy Lord,
Almighty Father in-"

88
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.117
Aah!

89
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.117
"Everlasting God...

90
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.283
"and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ...

91
00:05:58.408 --> 00:06:00.617
"and the Virgin Mary's
baby daddy.

00:06:00.742 --> 00:06:03.700
"Holy Lord,
Almighty Father...

93
00:06:03.825 --> 00:06:05.325
"everlasting God...

94
00:06:05.408 --> 00:06:08.283
"who once consigned
that fallen tyrant...

95

100
00:06:18.283 --> 00:06:20.992
Fuck me! Fuck me!

101
00:06:21.075 --> 00:06:22.658
Father!

102
00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:24.450
Father!

103
00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:25.492
Huh?

104
00:06:25.575 --> 00:06:27.450
This is not
part of the ritual.

105
00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:33.617
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy-

106
00:06:33.742 --> 00:06:35.700
Ha, ha, ha!

107
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.117
Ha, ha, ha!

108
00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:48.367
Ha, ha, ha!

109
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.408
Oh!

110
00:06:57.242 --> 00:06:58.658
Here you go, Father.
All clean.

111
00:06:58.783 --> 00:07:00.200
Oh, thank you so much.

112
00:07:00.283 --> 00:07:02.200
OK.

113
00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:04.242
Hee, hee, hee!

114
00:07:04.367 --> 00:07:06.283
You failed, McFeely.

115
00:07:06.408 --> 00:07:08.867
Your weapons are useless
against me.

116
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.700
Let us pray.

117
00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:13.617
Our Father who Art in Heaven-

118
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.783
Ha ha!

119
00:07:14.908 --> 00:07:16.367
Stop it!

120
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.867
Hallowed be Thy name.

121
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.950
Ha ha!

122
00:07:19.075 --> 00:07:20.075
Zip it.

123
00:07:20.283 --> 00:07:21.367
Thy kingdom come.

124
00:07:21.492 --> 00:07:24.450
Your mother sucks cocks in Hell.

125
00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:25.492
Ha! Shit!

126
00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:30.617
Suck on this.

127
00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:31.825
Uh-oh!

128
00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.325
Why can't you call
and say you miss me?

129
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.450
So you think you made it
into the class, Shorty?

130
00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:03.783
I sure hope so, Cindy.

131
00:08:03.908 --> 00:08:05.325
You could use the grade, huh?

132
00:08:05.408 --> 00:08:07.617
Nah. I need a place to stay.

133
00:08:07.742 --> 00:08:10.408
Mom Dukes kicked me out,
but you know something?

134
00:08:10.492 --> 00:08:12.867
I learned something
very important in college-

135
00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.242
the value of books.

136
00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:15.242
Really?

137
00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:16.450
Yeah. Look at this here.

138
00:08:18.075 --> 00:08:22.575
Free paper. Ha ha!
Shit, son.

139
00:08:22.658 --> 00:08:24.867
Yeah, so how
you digging college?

140
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.117
I don't know.

141
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.575
It's OK, I guess.

142
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.992
I feel like such a geek
sometimes, though.

143
00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:33.533
Everyone is so cool,
and I'm... not.

144
00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:35.700
Oh, come on, Cindy.

145
00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:37.158
You ain't that bad.

146
00:08:37.242 --> 00:08:39.117
All you need is
a little bit of flavor.

147
00:08:39.242 --> 00:08:40.742
Hmm. Maybe some new gear.

148
00:08:40.825 --> 00:08:41.992
"Gear?"

149
00:08:42.075 --> 00:08:43.325
That's slang for "clothing. "

150
00:08:43.408 --> 00:08:45.325
- Oh.
- Here. Come on.

151
00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:46.742
We gonna cool you up
right now.

152
00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:50.325
Don't sit like this,
first of all.

153
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.450
Don't sit like that, son.
Sit cool.

154
00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:54.367
- OK.
- Right up, son.

155
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.450
Feel yourself, son,
like that.

156
00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:57.783
Yeah. Now go like this.

157
00:08:57.867 --> 00:08:59.992
Uh. Uh, yeah.

158
00:09:00.117 --> 00:09:02.033
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

159
00:09:02.117 --> 00:09:03.700
Yeah. Now stand up,
let me show you some moves.

160
00:09:03.783 --> 00:09:06.033
Right, left.

161
00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:08.242
Uh, son. Uh!

162
00:09:08.325 --> 00:09:09.492
Right, left.

163
00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:10.700
Right, kick.

164
00:09:10.825 --> 00:09:11.742
Uh, son.

165
00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:13.033
Uh, psych.

166
00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:14.117
Throw a little bit
of slang in there.

167
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.950
Say, "Yo, that jacket
is tight, son. Ya mean?"

168
00:09:18.033 --> 00:09:20.742
Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

169
00:09:20.825 --> 00:09:22.492
- Ya mean?
- Ya mean?

170
00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:25.533
Yeah, something like that.

171
00:09:25.617 --> 00:09:26.533
Throw it all together.

172
00:09:26.617 --> 00:09:28.158
OK. Right, left.

173
00:09:28.242 --> 00:09:29.867
Right, kick, uh!

174
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.033
Yo, that jacket is tight.

175
00:09:32.117 --> 00:09:35.158
Now run that shit, bitch.
Ya mean?

176
00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:39.200
That is the shit, dog.

177
00:09:39.325 --> 00:09:42.325
Oh, man.
You boners aren't ready yet?

178
00:09:42.408 --> 00:09:44.450
Dude, relax, man.
I'm telling you,

179
00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:46.450
We'll get there on time,
all right?

180
00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:48.283
Yo, dogs, what y'all think?

181
00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:49.992
Tucked in or out?

182
00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:52.700
- Out, man.
- Out, man. Come on.

183
00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:55.200
No doubt. No doubt.
That's what I thought.

184
00:09:55.325 --> 00:09:57.950
You fuckheads would be ready if
you weren't partying all night.

185
00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:00.325
Come on, man.
It was so awesome.

186
00:10:00.408 --> 00:10:01.658
We got so wasted, man!

187
00:10:01.783 --> 00:10:03.408
I had, like, a keg myself.

188
00:10:03.492 --> 00:10:05.533
I woke up naked
in a tub of ice.

189
00:10:05.617 --> 00:10:06.617
All right!

190
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.117
Yeah, man.

191
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.367
Oh, shit, Ray,
you got a tattoo.

192
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.658
Oh, shit.
What's it say?

193
00:10:13.742 --> 00:10:15.867
"Ray!" Oh, man.

194
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.783
Oh, shit,
you got a tattoo, too.

195
00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:18.867
Oh, really? Dude!

196
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.742
Dude, what's it say?

197
00:10:20.825 --> 00:10:22.283
"Fucked me. "

198
00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:24.242
Oh, sweet, man.
"Ray... "

199
00:10:24.325 --> 00:10:25.492
"Fucked me. "

200
00:10:25.575 --> 00:10:27.617
- "Ray... "
- "Fucked me. "

201
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.492
"Ray fucked me. "

202
00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:32.408
Yeah! Ha ha! Whoo!

203
00:10:32.492 --> 00:10:34.450
What, man?

204
00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:35.700
Oh.

205
00:10:35.825 --> 00:10:37.408
Wedgie moment! Ha ha!

206
00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:40.867
Come on. You're gonna give me
a yeast infection.

207
00:10:40.992 --> 00:10:42.533
Hey, girl, that jacket
is slamming.

208
00:10:42.617 --> 00:10:43.533
Thanks.

209
00:10:43.617 --> 00:10:44.700
You better be careful,
though.

210
00:10:44.783 --> 00:10:45.950
Some girl
got an ass-whipping...

211
00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:47.742
over a jacket
stolen earlier today.

212
00:10:47.825 --> 00:10:50.033
Some people is so ghetto.

213
00:10:50.158 --> 00:10:52.200
What class we got next?

214
00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:53.325
Psychology.

215
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.575
Oh! Me, too! 101?

216
00:10:55.658 --> 00:10:58.492
- In room 302 at 10?
- That's it!

217
00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.033
Oh! Uh-uh!
No. This is too much.

218
00:11:01.117 --> 00:11:02.283
I got these psychic powers
on line.

219
00:11:02.408 --> 00:11:04.867
Remind me to get
a lotto ticket tomorrow.

220
00:11:04.992 --> 00:11:06.867
Oh, don't split the pole now.

221
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.658
That is very, very bad luck.
My psychic told me.

222
00:11:09.742 --> 00:11:12.033
You don't really believe
in that stuff, do you?

223
00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:14.033
Yes, I do. Very much.

224
00:11:20.242 --> 00:11:21.867
Are these all the subjects?

225
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.992
Yes, sir.
I took the liberty of putting...

226
00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:26.367
those with near-death
experiences on the very top.

227
00:11:26.492 --> 00:11:27.908
Any of them hot?

228
00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:31.117
As I'm sure you are aware,
Professor...

229
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.325
subjects who are close to death
are statistically more likely...

230
00:11:34.408 --> 00:11:36.075
to have
the suggestibility required...

231
00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:39.117
for paranormal investigation,
which is why, of course...

232
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.033
I gave them
special consideration.

233
00:11:42.117 --> 00:11:43.658
Oh, good thinking, Dwight.

234
00:11:43.742 --> 00:11:46.033
Traumatized coeds
are a sure thing.

235
00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:50.450
Ooh, I like her.

236
00:11:50.533 --> 00:11:51.908
Oh, yes, sir.
That is Cindy Campbell-

237
00:11:51.992 --> 00:11:55.117
classic abandoned
personality disorder.

238
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.033
She seems guarded,
but willing.

239
00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.700
And this?

240
00:11:59.783 --> 00:12:01.367
That is Ray Wilkins, sir.

241
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.950
I couldn't quite
figure him out...

242
00:12:03.033 --> 00:12:05.242
but he seemed very eager
and pleased to meet me.

243
00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:07.492
What's this?

244
00:12:07.617 --> 00:12:12.283
It's a picture that he sent
after the interview.

245
00:12:12.367 --> 00:12:15.200
Where did you find these kids?

246
00:12:15.283 --> 00:12:16.742
Sir, they're all survivors...

247
00:12:16.825 --> 00:12:18.367
of the Stevenston County
Massacre.

248
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.783
Oh, fantastic!

249
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.450
These kids are exactly
the catalyst we need...

250
00:12:26.575 --> 00:12:30.158
to awaken
the spirits of Hell House.

251
00:12:30.283 --> 00:12:33.617
Sir, exactly how are we going
to get them up there?

252
00:12:33.783 --> 00:12:35.325
We'll tell them...

253
00:12:35.408 --> 00:12:36.950
it's part of the class.

254
00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:40.158
We'll say-excuse me-

255
00:12:40.242 --> 00:12:41.492
that they're participating
in a study...

256
00:12:41.575 --> 00:12:43.867
of sleep disorders.

257
00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:45.783
We are going
to make history, Dwight-

258
00:12:45.867 --> 00:12:48.158
the first documented...

259
00:12:48.283 --> 00:12:52.950
unrefuted evidence
of life after death.

260
00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:54.200
Welcome, everybody.

261
00:12:54.283 --> 00:12:56.367
I'm Professor Oldman.

262
00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.200
Each of you have been
carefully selected...

263
00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:00.617
to be in this class...

264
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.450
for which you receive
an automatic grade of "A"...

265
00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:06.367
upon completion.

266
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.783
Now, this year's study
is insomnia.

267
00:13:11.242 --> 00:13:13.533
We are going to spend
the weekend together...

268
00:13:13.658 --> 00:13:16.117
where we've established
a controlled environment...

269
00:13:16.242 --> 00:13:21.117
in which we'll study
your various sleep disorders.

270
00:13:21.242 --> 00:13:22.492
Now, I'll be passing out
directions-

271
00:13:22.575 --> 00:13:24.783
- I can do it.
- No.

272
00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:26.492
- No, Dwight.
- I can do it.

273
00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:29.783
I can... myself... do it.

274
00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:31.783
Now, you should all be there...

275
00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:36.450
by 6 p. m. tonight
and plan to stay through Monday.

276
00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:38.117
I'll see you all this evening.

277
00:13:38.242 --> 00:13:40.450
Hey!

278
00:13:40.575 --> 00:13:41.825
You left your book
back there.

279
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.492
Oh. Thanks.

280
00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:45.950
I'm Cindy.

281
00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:47.617
- Buddy.
- Hey.

282
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.658
So, looks like we're gonna
spend the weekend together.

283
00:13:50.742 --> 00:13:51.992
Yeah.

284
00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:55.283
You want to get together
and study or something?

285
00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:57.492
Study? Ha!

286
00:13:58.575 --> 00:13:59.575
That was kind of bad.

287
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.867
Ha, ha, ha!

288
00:14:00.992 --> 00:14:02.075
I'm sorry, Buddy.

289
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.033
You seem like
a really nice guy...

290
00:14:05.117 --> 00:14:08.325
but I just got out of
a really bad relationship...

291
00:14:08.408 --> 00:14:10.617
so I'm not quite ready
to start dating yet.

292
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.492
Oh.

293
00:14:12.575 --> 00:14:14.783
But, hey, you know,
maybe we could be friends.

294
00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:18.033
Sure. Yeah. Cool.
That-friends.

295
00:14:18.117 --> 00:14:20.200
OK. See you later, friend.

296
00:14:20.283 --> 00:14:22.117
All right, pal.

297
00:14:23.575 --> 00:14:24.825
Oh!

298
00:14:24.908 --> 00:14:28.325
Wedgie! Smell you later!

299
00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:54.242
Hey! Will you shut the fuck up...

300
00:14:54.325 --> 00:14:55.575
and let me sing?

301
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.867
Ow!

302
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.367
Hello?

303
00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.450
Oh!

304
00:15:46.575 --> 00:15:48.533
Hello?

305
00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.158
Hello?

306
00:16:02.408 --> 00:16:05.117
Hi, little guy.
Look at you.

307
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.283
Little? I'm not little.

308
00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:09.325
I'm hung like a bull, lady.
Check it out.

309
00:16:09.408 --> 00:16:11.200
You ever seen
a bird dick this big?

310
00:16:11.283 --> 00:16:12.742
Too much for you, huh, baby?

311
00:16:12.825 --> 00:16:13.742
Yeah.

312
00:16:13.867 --> 00:16:15.742
All right.
Step off then, sweet cheeks.

313
00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:17.533
Come back when you want
some real loving.

314
00:16:18.908 --> 00:16:20.950
OK.

315
00:16:21.033 --> 00:16:22.408
Fucking tease.

316
00:16:29.492 --> 00:16:31.283
Hello?

317
00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:35.867
Aah!

318
00:16:42.117 --> 00:16:44.492
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, child.

319
00:16:44.575 --> 00:16:46.283
Did I frighten you, child?

320
00:16:46.367 --> 00:16:50.200
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you scared?

321
00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:52.617
All right.
I'll sing to you.

322
00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:57.617
God is in his holy temple

323
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.617
Better?

324
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.117
I'm here with
Professor Oldman's group.

325
00:17:07.242 --> 00:17:10.492
I'm Hanson.
I'm the caretaker.

326
00:17:10.575 --> 00:17:12.158
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:17:12.242 --> 00:17:13.617
And what's your name,
sweet child?

328
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.783
I'm Cindy.

329
00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:16.325
Cindy.

330
00:17:16.408 --> 00:17:19.992
Oh, but the resemblance
is striking.

331
00:17:20.117 --> 00:17:24.700
Look at the thin cheek bones
and the same lips.

332
00:17:24.783 --> 00:17:26.908
Same-same eyes.

333
00:17:26.992 --> 00:17:29.283
Look at your hair.

334
00:17:29.408 --> 00:17:30.325
Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:17:30.408 --> 00:17:32.533
You've got the same nose.

336
00:17:32.658 --> 00:17:33.908
Tickle, tickle.

337
00:17:33.992 --> 00:17:36.200
Be-boop, be-boop
on the nose.

338
00:17:36.325 --> 00:17:37.825
Ha, ha, ha!

339
00:17:37.908 --> 00:17:40.367
Shall I show you to your room?

340
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.200
Oh! Oh, that's heavy.
Whoo! That's heavy!

341
00:17:43.283 --> 00:17:45.492
I better use my strong hand.

342
00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:47.867
- Oh! Clumsy.
- Oh! No, that's fine.

343
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.742
Look, you got the panties-

344
00:17:49.825 --> 00:17:51.200
I can take care of it.

345
00:17:51.283 --> 00:17:52.867
Look at-
Oh, what you got here?

346
00:17:54.158 --> 00:17:56.617
Ah!

347
00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.950
Can't forget your toothbrush.

348
00:17:58.033 --> 00:17:59.117
Oh!

349
00:17:59.242 --> 00:18:00.492
Gonna need that for later.

350
00:18:00.617 --> 00:18:02.325
OK. Here we go.
Follow me, child.

351
00:18:02.408 --> 00:18:04.033
- Oh, God.
- Watch my bottom.

352
00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:05.200
Coming through.

353
00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:07.158
Come on. Right this way.

354
00:18:07.242 --> 00:18:09.367
Here we are.

355
00:18:10.658 --> 00:18:14.408
So, um, do you
live here by yourself?

356
00:18:14.492 --> 00:18:16.242
Well, yes.
We've tried to rent it out...

357
00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:18.450
but people don't seem
to want to stay very long.

358
00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:22.117
Ha ha!
Oh, there's old Mother Kane...

359
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.242
and that's old Master Kane.

360
00:18:24.367 --> 00:18:25.950
Who's that?

361
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.075
That's Big Daddy Kane.

362
00:18:29.158 --> 00:18:30.158
Oh.

363
00:18:30.283 --> 00:18:31.367
Oh, he's cute.

364
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.367
Oh, yeah.

365
00:18:32.492 --> 00:18:35.367
That was the master's
favorite toy.

366
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.117
I don't know what
it's doing out here.

367
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.658
I swear.
Sometimes I think...

368
00:18:39.742 --> 00:18:42.283
these toys have
a mind of their own.

369
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.325
Ow! Ow!

370
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.492
Right this way.

371
00:18:55.867 --> 00:18:58.742
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that room, sweetheart.

372
00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:01.033
No. That was the master's
mistress's room.

373
00:19:01.117 --> 00:19:05.033
Yeah, he kind of was
a little bit of a hornball.

374
00:19:05.117 --> 00:19:08.033
No. You go and stay
right over here.

375
00:19:08.117 --> 00:19:11.117
This was the room that belonged
to the love of his life...

376
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.367
his wife, Caroline.

377
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.783
I'll show it to you.

378
00:19:15.867 --> 00:19:18.325
Oh! Watch. My fanny's
coming through.

379
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.575
Watch it.
Make room for fanny.

380
00:19:21.658 --> 00:19:24.867
Oh, wow! It's beautiful.

381
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.117
Well, thank you, child.

382
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.033
You know,
I have been working out.

383
00:19:28.117 --> 00:19:30.200
I've been doing
my bun busters every day.

384
00:19:30.283 --> 00:19:32.825
I squeeze really tight,
and then I let loose.

385
00:19:32.908 --> 00:19:35.450
I squeeze really tight...

386
00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:36.950
and then let loose.

387
00:19:37.033 --> 00:19:37.950
Ooh!

388
00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:42.950
OK. Ooh!

389
00:19:43.075 --> 00:19:44.908
Oh, yes.

390
00:19:44.992 --> 00:19:46.158
Look at this.

391
00:19:46.242 --> 00:19:48.283
Caroline looked beautiful
in that dress.

392
00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:51.658
In fact, she always
looked her best.

393
00:19:51.742 --> 00:19:53.700
Do you know that
she used to entertain...

394
00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:56.575
for royalty
and common folk and...

395
00:19:56.658 --> 00:19:58.450
even the President
of the United States.

396
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:02.617
Ew.

397
00:20:04.742 --> 00:20:05.908
Oh!

398
00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:07.033
Oh, don't be frightened, child.

399
00:20:07.117 --> 00:20:09.158
This is just Mr. Kittles.

400
00:20:09.242 --> 00:20:11.617
He was the master's
favorite pet.

401
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.075
He's been in the family
for generations.

402
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.575
Look at him.
He hasn't aged a day.

403
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.533
All right, child,
I think I'll take my leave.

404
00:20:20.617 --> 00:20:24.117
You let me know
if there's anything you need.

405
00:20:24.492 --> 00:20:26.033
Yes, and as you
can see, Professor...

406
00:20:26.075 --> 00:20:27.575
I've taken care
of everything...

407
00:20:27.658 --> 00:20:29.700
including medical supplies
and blood storage.

408
00:20:29.825 --> 00:20:31.325
We want to be safe.

409
00:20:31.408 --> 00:20:33.950
Are these cameras
all throughout the house?

410
00:20:34.075 --> 00:20:36.450
Yes, sir. I thought
that would be best.

411
00:20:36.575 --> 00:20:38.367
So if one of
our little chickadees...

412
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.450
were to be taking a shower...

413
00:20:40.533 --> 00:20:42.617
which button would I press
to get a closeup?

414
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.242
That one.

415
00:20:44.325 --> 00:20:46.450
This one?

416
00:20:46.575 --> 00:20:48.158
Ha!

417
00:20:48.242 --> 00:20:49.575
Excuse me, Professor...

418
00:20:49.658 --> 00:20:53.325
but your guests
have begun to arrive...

419
00:20:53.408 --> 00:20:57.158
and supper
shall be served shortly.

420
00:20:57.242 --> 00:20:58.325
OK. Thanks, handyman.

421
00:20:58.408 --> 00:21:01.367
I'm actually the caretaker.

422
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.492
Oh, aren't those
cool new skates?

423
00:21:04.575 --> 00:21:05.992
Now, you be careful
with those.

424
00:21:06.075 --> 00:21:07.950
Don't want to fall
and break something.

425
00:21:08.075 --> 00:21:09.242
Oh, that's funny.
That's real funny.

426
00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:12.950
Let me give you a hand.

427
00:21:13.033 --> 00:21:15.325
Well, that-that's
awful kind of you.

428
00:21:15.408 --> 00:21:17.617
How about you give me
a standing ovation?

429
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.950
Why don't you lift me up?

430
00:21:19.075 --> 00:21:21.825
Oh! OK. I see where
you're going with this one.

431
00:21:21.908 --> 00:21:24.658
You look familiar to me.
Were you in "Stomp"?

432
00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:26.575
Hey, you can kiss my grits.

433
00:21:26.658 --> 00:21:28.700
I think I'll be the bigger man
now and walk away.

434
00:21:28.783 --> 00:21:30.908
Walk away.

435
00:21:30.992 --> 00:21:33.117
Um, I'll go and change for dinner.

436
00:21:33.242 --> 00:21:34.617
- OK.
- I'll see you shortly.

437
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.325
Sounds good.

438
00:21:36.408 --> 00:21:39.158
I'll just run upstairs
and jump into my jogging suit.

439
00:21:39.242 --> 00:21:40.158
I'll be right down.

440
00:21:42.158 --> 00:21:43.075
Hey!

441
00:21:43.158 --> 00:21:46.408
Hey there, little guy.
How you doing?

442
00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:48.325
Fuck off, four eyes.

443
00:21:49.658 --> 00:21:50.825
I beg your pardon?

444
00:21:50.908 --> 00:21:54.325
I said, "Fuck off, four eyes. "

445
00:21:55.742 --> 00:21:57.200
Oh, I ought to
kick your ass.

446
00:21:57.283 --> 00:21:58.283
Hey! Hey! Hey!

447
00:21:58.367 --> 00:22:01.617
Relax, son.
It's just a bird.

448
00:22:03.033 --> 00:22:05.658
Hello, birdie.
Polly want a cracker?

449
00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:07.825
Polly wants
your mama's sweet ass.

450
00:22:07.908 --> 00:22:09.575
What did Polly say to me?

451
00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:13.783
I said, "Polly wants
your mama's sweet ass. "

452
00:22:13.867 --> 00:22:15.950
You don't be talking
about my mama, son.

453
00:22:16.033 --> 00:22:17.283
You don't know my mama, son.

454
00:22:17.408 --> 00:22:19.450
Yeah, I know your mama.
I fucked her last night.

455
00:22:19.533 --> 00:22:21.492
You want beef?
I'll fuck you up!

456
00:22:21.575 --> 00:22:23.408
Ooh! I'm shaking.
I'm shaking.

457
00:22:23.492 --> 00:22:24.408
Now, fuck this.

458
00:22:24.533 --> 00:22:25.700
I'm gonna handle this shit
like a gentleman.

459
00:22:25.825 --> 00:22:26.742
Yo, hold my tooth, son.

460
00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:28.283
Yeah, come on, bitch.

461
00:22:28.367 --> 00:22:29.367
You and that
"Welcome Back, Kotter" haircut.

462
00:22:29.492 --> 00:22:30.742
Want a piece of me?
Come on. Bring it on.

463
00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:31.950
What, you hard core?
Give me some.

464
00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:33.992
- Bring it on, bitch.
- No, no. What?

465
00:22:35.158 --> 00:22:36.492
You gonna talk, son?
Then do it.

466
00:22:36.575 --> 00:22:37.825
Come on, pussy.
Let me out of here.

467
00:22:37.908 --> 00:22:38.992
I'll fuck you up.

468
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.450
Hi, guys.

469
00:22:41.533 --> 00:22:43.408
- Hey.
- Hey.

470
00:22:43.492 --> 00:22:44.408
Hey, Buddy.

471
00:22:44.492 --> 00:22:45.742
- Hey, Cin.
- How you doing?

472
00:22:45.825 --> 00:22:47.325
Open chest!

473
00:22:47.408 --> 00:22:50.783
Come on. You got to be
quicker than that, "A" cup.

474
00:22:50.867 --> 00:22:52.742
Oh! Oh!

475
00:22:53.992 --> 00:22:55.242
Hey, guys.

476
00:22:55.325 --> 00:22:56.575
- Hey!
- How you doing?

477
00:22:56.658 --> 00:22:58.617
Well, are you boys
just gonna sit there...

478
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.075
with your mouths open...

479
00:23:00.158 --> 00:23:02.283
or is someone gonna
offer me a seat?

480
00:23:02.408 --> 00:23:03.658
Oh!

481
00:23:05.867 --> 00:23:06.867
Ow!

482
00:23:06.992 --> 00:23:08.575
I warmed it up for you.

483
00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:10.450
It's the best seat
in the house.

484
00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:11.783
Second best.

485
00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:14.075
Ew.

486
00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:16.367
Professor, is this the same house...

487
00:23:16.492 --> 00:23:18.783
that a young girl
was possessed by a demon...

488
00:23:18.867 --> 00:23:19.950
or something?

489
00:23:20.033 --> 00:23:22.575
Yes, it was reported
but never substantiated.

490
00:23:27.533 --> 00:23:28.950
All right. Well, uh...

491
00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.617
who'd like some appetizers?

492
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.950
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

493
00:23:32.033 --> 00:23:34.158
That's what I like to hear.

494
00:23:34.242 --> 00:23:36.450
Hey, these buns look good.

495
00:23:36.575 --> 00:23:37.492
Oh, yeah...

496
00:23:37.575 --> 00:23:39.283
and they're so soft and warm.

497
00:23:39.367 --> 00:23:40.450
- Ray!
- Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.

498
00:23:40.575 --> 00:23:42.950
These are delicious.

499
00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:44.575
Thank you, my child.

500
00:23:44.658 --> 00:23:46.867
I made them by hand.

501
00:23:46.992 --> 00:23:48.825
OK!

502
00:23:48.908 --> 00:23:52.950
Here we go. I think
the taters are just about done.

503
00:23:53.033 --> 00:23:57.075
I'm just gonna give them
one quick whisk here.

504
00:24:05.492 --> 00:24:08.450
OK, now. Dig in.

505
00:24:09.575 --> 00:24:10.742
All right.

506
00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:12.575
Now it's time for the turkey.

507
00:24:12.658 --> 00:24:14.492
Oh, what a beautiful bird.

508
00:24:14.575 --> 00:24:15.575
- No!
- No, man!

509
00:24:15.658 --> 00:24:17.283
Hey! Hey! Hey, man.

510
00:24:17.367 --> 00:24:18.283
Why don't you
just relax...

511
00:24:18.367 --> 00:24:19.783
and just let me
do that for you?

512
00:24:19.867 --> 00:24:22.575
- Yeah.
- Rest that little hand.

513
00:24:22.658 --> 00:24:24.950
It's my pleasure, but what
a nice young man to offer.

514
00:24:25.033 --> 00:24:27.325
Let me give you
a little pinch there.

515
00:24:27.408 --> 00:24:28.492
Come on.

516
00:24:28.575 --> 00:24:30.950
Fuck it!

517
00:24:31.033 --> 00:24:33.408
You know, a lot of people...

518
00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:35.283
are kind of intimidated...

519
00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:38.117
about making a turkey,
but...

520
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.533
really it's very simple.

521
00:24:39.617 --> 00:24:42.242
You just have to know
the anatomy of a turkey...

522
00:24:42.325 --> 00:24:43.908
and it's got, over here...

523
00:24:43.992 --> 00:24:45.242
just the tiniest
little stinkhole...

524
00:24:45.325 --> 00:24:47.158
but it's big enough
to get your hand...

525
00:24:47.242 --> 00:24:48.742
right up inside it.

526
00:24:48.825 --> 00:24:50.908
Uh!

527
00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:53.492
Stuff the shit out of it.

528
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:55.408
I cook it
with all the giblets-

529
00:24:55.492 --> 00:24:57.158
the penises
and the ginies...

530
00:24:57.242 --> 00:25:00.450
And now, a lot of people
like to baste their turkeys...

531
00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:02.742
but I use this.

532
00:25:02.825 --> 00:25:04.575
I lick like that...

533
00:25:04.658 --> 00:25:06.450
and get
into the little...

534
00:25:06.533 --> 00:25:08.408
hiney... hiney ho...

535
00:25:09.492 --> 00:25:10.908
That's nice and good.

536
00:25:10.992 --> 00:25:12.658
I don't know
what the hell that is...

537
00:25:12.742 --> 00:25:14.075
but I'll lick it anyway.

538
00:25:14.158 --> 00:25:15.408
Up and down...

539
00:25:15.492 --> 00:25:17.450
and then I like to get
that right on there...

540
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:21.450
Hiawatha!

541
00:25:22.617 --> 00:25:23.992
And I got one of these.

542
00:25:24.075 --> 00:25:25.325
I'm gonna pull that off...

543
00:25:25.408 --> 00:25:27.283
and bam! That just
kicks it up a little bit.

544
00:25:27.408 --> 00:25:28.992
All right.
I think that's almost...

545
00:25:29.075 --> 00:25:30.325
ready now.

546
00:25:30.408 --> 00:25:32.700
And then we
bring it to the table.

547
00:25:32.825 --> 00:25:35.367
Mmm, good.

548
00:25:35.492 --> 00:25:37.117
All right.

549
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.908
Who's ready for a wing?

550
00:25:38.992 --> 00:25:40.700
Yours or the turkey's?

551
00:25:40.783 --> 00:25:41.867
Ha, ha, ha!

552
00:25:41.992 --> 00:25:43.950
I just thought that was funny.

553
00:25:44.033 --> 00:25:45.908
Well, I know what you'd like.

554
00:25:45.992 --> 00:25:47.408
How about a leg?

555
00:25:47.492 --> 00:25:50.450
Whoo!

556
00:25:50.533 --> 00:25:52.242
How about two? Ha ha!

557
00:25:52.325 --> 00:25:53.575
How about
I take these two legs...

558
00:25:53.658 --> 00:25:54.908
and shove
them right up your ass-

559
00:25:54.992 --> 00:25:55.992
all the way to the knee!

560
00:25:56.117 --> 00:25:58.075
Dwight. Dwight, relax.

561
00:25:58.158 --> 00:25:59.783
Hanson...

562
00:25:59.867 --> 00:26:02.533
may I ask you is there
something on the menu...

563
00:26:02.617 --> 00:26:05.492
that you haven't
personally prepared?

564
00:26:05.575 --> 00:26:08.992
Well, I ordered out
the dessert.

565
00:26:09.117 --> 00:26:10.492
All right!

566
00:26:10.575 --> 00:26:11.492
Make room.

567
00:26:11.575 --> 00:26:13.533
Here comes the pie.

568
00:26:13.617 --> 00:26:15.700
All right. OK. Mmm.

569
00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:18.242
Who wants the first piece
of that pie?

570
00:26:18.325 --> 00:26:21.992
Huh? I see you
eyeing the first piece.

571
00:26:23.492 --> 00:26:25.367
Oh, that's good.

572
00:26:25.492 --> 00:26:27.158
Mm mmm.
Pass that down to her.

573
00:26:27.242 --> 00:26:28.658
Thank you.

574
00:26:28.742 --> 00:26:30.200
That's nice.

575
00:26:30.283 --> 00:26:32.242
My germs.

576
00:26:32.325 --> 00:26:33.242
Ha, ha, ha!

577
00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:34.658
My germs.

578
00:26:34.742 --> 00:26:36.617
Ha, ha, ha! My germs!
Ha, ha, ha!

579
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.617
Hey...

580
00:26:50.325 --> 00:26:54.408
Come play with me.

581
00:26:56.408 --> 00:26:59.533
Come play.

582
00:26:59.617 --> 00:27:01.825
Ha ha!

583
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.117
Hello?

584
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.617
Ooh!

585
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.242
Cindy... Cindy.

586
00:28:22.325 --> 00:28:23.783
Who is it?

587
00:28:23.867 --> 00:28:25.742
I want to help you, Cindy.

588
00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:26.992
Who are you?

589
00:28:27.075 --> 00:28:29.117
You're in danger, Cindy.

590
00:28:29.242 --> 00:28:30.783
I want to help you.

591
00:28:30.867 --> 00:28:33.617
Help me how?
Who's in danger?

592
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.533
Check the music room.

593
00:28:36.617 --> 00:28:37.950
Where are you?

594
00:28:38.033 --> 00:28:40.825
Check
the fucking music room!

595
00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:44.200
Hey, Cindy, think fast!

596
00:28:44.283 --> 00:28:47.158
Ohh! Uhh! Aah!

597
00:28:47.242 --> 00:28:49.117
Dude, you suck!

598
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.533
Ow.

599
00:28:51.658 --> 00:28:53.408
Buddy...

600
00:28:53.492 --> 00:28:54.867
about
this friendship thing-

601
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.575
Yeah, I think it is so cool
having a girl as a friend.

602
00:28:57.658 --> 00:28:59.283
That's just it, Buddy.

603
00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:00.950
I am a girl.

604
00:29:01.033 --> 00:29:02.825
You can't be so rough
with me.

605
00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.658
Well, then what the hell
are we supposed to do?

606
00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:07.033
Gentle stuff.

607
00:29:07.158 --> 00:29:09.200
You know, like talking and...

608
00:29:09.283 --> 00:29:12.200
sharing secrets
and past experiences.

609
00:29:12.283 --> 00:29:14.158
You know, stuff like that.

610
00:29:14.242 --> 00:29:17.242
That sounds kind of gay.

611
00:29:17.325 --> 00:29:19.450
I guess since you're a girl
it's all right.

612
00:29:19.533 --> 00:29:21.992
- Yeah. It'll be fine.
- All right.

613
00:29:22.117 --> 00:29:24.492
Hey, listen. Will you come
check something out with me?

614
00:29:24.575 --> 00:29:26.700
Sure. We can practice
our talking.

615
00:29:26.825 --> 00:29:28.158
Yeah. Exactly.

616
00:29:28.242 --> 00:29:29.242
I want to tell you
about this thing...

617
00:29:29.325 --> 00:29:30.658
that happened to me
when I was in high school.

618
00:29:30.742 --> 00:29:32.158
Really? What happened?

619
00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:34.533
This hot Spanish chick's
licking my nuts-

620
00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:35.533
Buddy!

621
00:29:35.617 --> 00:29:37.492
No, no.
This is the best part.

622
00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:38.742
Oh, my God. Look.

623
00:29:38.867 --> 00:29:42.033
Oh, dude!
Someone's on the rag!

624
00:29:42.117 --> 00:29:43.700
Shh!

625
00:29:43.783 --> 00:29:45.908
They lead straight
to the bookcase.

626
00:29:58.033 --> 00:30:00.033
God.

627
00:30:00.117 --> 00:30:03.325
Must be a secret study
or something.

628
00:30:13.242 --> 00:30:15.450
Wow.

629
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.783
Oh, my God.

630
00:30:24.867 --> 00:30:26.408
It says Hugh Kane
and his mistress...

631
00:30:26.492 --> 00:30:28.075
were murdered
in this house.

632
00:30:28.158 --> 00:30:29.992
Whoa. Check this out.

633
00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:34.617
This must be his wife.

634
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.908
Oh, my God.
She looks just like you.

635
00:30:37.033 --> 00:30:38.533
You think?

636
00:30:38.617 --> 00:30:40.992
- She's really beautiful.
- Yeah.

637
00:30:41.117 --> 00:30:43.033
Well, actually,
her hair doesn't have...

638
00:30:43.117 --> 00:30:44.867
as many split ends as yours...

639
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:46.783
and her skin isn't
as oily as yours, either.

640
00:30:46.867 --> 00:30:48.617
Also, sometimes your eyes
get kind of squinty...

641
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.325
and you look like
you might have Down Syndrome.

642
00:30:51.408 --> 00:30:53.158
Other than that, though,
the resemblance is uncanny.

643
00:30:53.242 --> 00:30:55.617
Really?

644
00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:56.950
Also, her tits are perfect.

645
00:30:57.033 --> 00:30:58.200
They're not pointy
or funny-looking like yours...

646
00:30:58.283 --> 00:30:59.367
or spaced too far apart.

647
00:30:59.492 --> 00:31:02.742
OK! Enough!

648
00:31:02.825 --> 00:31:04.867
God.

649
00:31:04.992 --> 00:31:07.283
Oh, my God, look at this.

650
00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:10.867
"Caroline. "

651
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.075
Must have been hers.

652
00:31:15.617 --> 00:31:16.533
Oh, my God.

653
00:31:16.617 --> 00:31:17.533
All right.
Let's get out of here.

654
00:31:17.617 --> 00:31:18.700
This place
gives me the creeps.

655
00:31:18.783 --> 00:31:20.242
OK. Grab the chest.

656
00:31:20.325 --> 00:31:21.575
Oh, thanks.

657
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.867
- Buddy!
- What?

658
00:31:22.992 --> 00:31:25.367
- I meant the chest.
- Right.

659
00:32:03.908 --> 00:32:05.158
What the-

660
00:32:13.867 --> 00:32:15.742
Hey.

661
00:32:17.992 --> 00:32:18.908
Nice.

662
00:32:21.658 --> 00:32:24.200
Mm-hmm...

663
00:32:24.283 --> 00:32:27.950
Mmm... mmm.

664
00:32:32.783 --> 00:32:34.033
Oh!

665
00:32:34.158 --> 00:32:36.117
Oh! OK!

666
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.742
Hello!

667
00:32:37.825 --> 00:32:39.575
If I had known,
I would have freshened up!

668
00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:41.200
I wish you were
freshened up, too.

669
00:32:41.283 --> 00:32:42.200
Get up there! Come on!

670
00:32:42.325 --> 00:32:43.242
Oh, you want this?

671
00:32:43.325 --> 00:32:44.242
Oh, yeah. Ooh, yeah.

672
00:32:44.325 --> 00:32:45.242
That's it, daddy.

673
00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:46.575
Take it like you want it.

674
00:32:46.658 --> 00:32:47.742
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

675
00:32:47.825 --> 00:32:49.533
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

676
00:32:49.617 --> 00:32:50.700
Yeah!

677
00:32:50.783 --> 00:32:51.783
Come here!

678
00:32:51.867 --> 00:32:53.117
Bring it on!

679
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.700
Kinky's my middle name, bitch!

680
00:32:54.783 --> 00:32:56.575
Ooh, yeah!

681
00:32:56.658 --> 00:32:59.700
That was the best
that I've ever had.

682
00:32:59.783 --> 00:33:01.033
Oh. Mrs. Huey Kane.

683
00:33:01.158 --> 00:33:02.617
Hmm?

684
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.617
Doesn't that just
have a ring to it?

685
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.533
Ha ha! Mmm... baby?

686
00:33:07.617 --> 00:33:09.742
Where you going?

687
00:33:09.825 --> 00:33:12.283
Call me!

688
00:33:19.325 --> 00:33:20.700
Let's do something freaky.

689
00:33:20.783 --> 00:33:23.825
Hee hee!
Like what, Ray?

690
00:33:23.908 --> 00:33:25.325
I don't know.

691
00:33:25.408 --> 00:33:29.242
Why don't you
talk dirty to me?

692
00:33:29.325 --> 00:33:30.867
I don't know
what to say, Ray.

693
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:33.075
Come on.
Just make something up.

694
00:33:34.867 --> 00:33:37.700
Oh, Ray,
why do you make me so bad?

695
00:33:37.783 --> 00:33:40.658
Come on.
Because you a bad girl.

696
00:33:40.742 --> 00:33:42.450
OK.

697
00:33:44.117 --> 00:33:45.033
I'm gonna work this.

698
00:33:45.158 --> 00:33:47.033
Yeah. Work it.

699
00:33:47.117 --> 00:33:48.783
I'm gonna make this mine.

700
00:33:48.867 --> 00:33:51.158
Mmm. It's all yours.
Oh, yeah.

701
00:33:51.283 --> 00:33:52.825
I'm gonna
piss on your face...

702
00:33:52.908 --> 00:33:54.450
and then I'm gonna fart
in your mouth.

703
00:33:54.533 --> 00:33:56.658
Yeah! And then I'm gonna
shit on these walls, Ray!

704
00:33:56.783 --> 00:33:57.700
Ooh!

705
00:33:57.825 --> 00:33:59.700
Hey!

706
00:33:59.825 --> 00:34:01.658
Too dirty?

707
00:34:06.492 --> 00:34:08.700
Hello?

708
00:34:13.033 --> 00:34:15.325
Oh, hey, kitty, kitty.

709
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:16.992
Hi, little fella.

710
00:34:21.658 --> 00:34:23.075
Aah! Aah! Aah!

711
00:34:28.742 --> 00:34:31.283
OK. OK.

712
00:34:31.408 --> 00:34:32.658
That's OK, cat.

713
00:34:35.158 --> 00:34:40.033
I think I know
why you're mad, Mr. Cat.

714
00:34:40.117 --> 00:34:43.033
I didn't mean to go poopie
in your litter box.

715
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:53.200
Help!
My pussy's gone crazy!

716
00:34:53.283 --> 00:34:55.825
Aah! Aah!

717
00:35:03.992 --> 00:35:05.950
Ha, ha, ha!

718
00:35:10.075 --> 00:35:11.658
Aah!

719
00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:13.867
Oh! Aah! Aah!

720
00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:24.158
OK. You want a piece of me?

721
00:35:24.283 --> 00:35:25.742
Huh?

722
00:35:26.867 --> 00:35:29.158
Yeah! How do you like that,
little pussy?

723
00:35:29.283 --> 00:35:30.700
Come on!

724
00:35:32.242 --> 00:35:34.783
Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

725
00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:36.867
Aah! Ohh!

726
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.325
Is that all you got?

727
00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:41.075
Huh? Come on!

728
00:35:41.158 --> 00:35:42.242
Give me your best shot!

729
00:35:58.075 --> 00:35:59.617
I'm telling you,
Professor...

730
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.325
it was possessed.

731
00:36:01.408 --> 00:36:03.283
Theo, did you see
this animal?

732
00:36:03.367 --> 00:36:04.450
No, I didn't.

733
00:36:04.575 --> 00:36:05.825
I heard
all the commotion...

734
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:07.117
but by the time
I went in there...

735
00:36:07.242 --> 00:36:08.908
I guess it was gone.

736
00:36:10.117 --> 00:36:11.283
Mm-hmm.

737
00:36:11.408 --> 00:36:13.283
What? So you think
I did this to myself?.

738
00:36:13.408 --> 00:36:15.617
No. All I'm saying
is that cats are known...

739
00:36:15.742 --> 00:36:17.700
to be very
territorial animals...

740
00:36:17.825 --> 00:36:19.783
and it's likely
that it did attack...

741
00:36:19.867 --> 00:36:22.492
but that doesn't mean
it was possessed.

742
00:36:24.033 --> 00:36:28.033
Maybe you two should
sleep together.

743
00:36:28.117 --> 00:36:30.492
What are you getting at,
Professor?

744
00:36:30.575 --> 00:36:33.867
I'm just saying that if indeed
this cat did attack...

745
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:37.617
it's less likely to come back
if the two of you were...

746
00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.992
let's say... together.

747
00:36:41.158 --> 00:36:43.158
Oh, come on, it's college.

748
00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:45.242
It's time for you two
to experiment.

749
00:36:45.325 --> 00:36:48.325
I don't think we're gonna
be getting much help here.

750
00:36:48.408 --> 00:36:49.408
Oh, on the contrary,
actually...

751
00:36:49.533 --> 00:36:51.325
I'd be more than happy
to walk you through it.

752
00:36:51.408 --> 00:36:52.325
Come on, Cin.

753
00:36:52.408 --> 00:36:53.325
I'll make sure
you get tucked in.

754
00:36:53.408 --> 00:36:55.200
Good idea.

755
00:36:55.283 --> 00:36:58.158
Don't forget to kiss
each other good night.

756
00:36:58.242 --> 00:37:00.867
There's something going on
in this house, Professor.

757
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.825
I'm not crazy!

758
00:37:02.908 --> 00:37:05.367
Aah!

759
00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:07.533
1, 2...

760
00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:13.575
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

761
00:37:13.658 --> 00:37:15.533
9, Brandon, 10...

762
00:37:15.658 --> 00:37:18.200
11, Brandon, come on!
Count with me!

763
00:37:36.533 --> 00:37:39.450
Hey, you.
Hee, hee, hee, hee!

764
00:37:39.533 --> 00:37:44.075
Come here a minute.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

765
00:37:44.158 --> 00:37:45.783
Come here.

766
00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:48.242
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

767
00:37:51.325 --> 00:37:54.200
Peekaboo!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

768
00:37:56.617 --> 00:37:59.075
Come on, let's play!

769
00:37:59.158 --> 00:38:01.908
This is a fun game, huh?

770
00:38:01.992 --> 00:38:03.575
Hey, what are you doing?

771
00:38:03.658 --> 00:38:05.075
Uncle Ray-Ray's got a game.

772
00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:06.242
Hey, get your finger
out of there.

773
00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:07.617
Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle...

774
00:38:07.742 --> 00:38:09.617
Aah! Aah!

775
00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:10.950
You want to play
with Uncle Ray?

776
00:38:11.075 --> 00:38:13.867
Peekaboo!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

777
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.158
Aah! Aah! Help!

778
00:38:16.283 --> 00:38:18.117
Aah!

779
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.283
Oh, God!

780
00:38:19.408 --> 00:38:20.908
Here's a little balloon animal.

781
00:38:20.992 --> 00:38:22.533
Da, da, da, da, da
da, da, da, da!

782
00:38:22.617 --> 00:38:24.408
Ohh!

783
00:38:33.117 --> 00:38:36.075
"I can't take
living with him any longer.

784
00:38:36.158 --> 00:38:38.200
"He's becoming a monster.

785
00:38:38.283 --> 00:38:41.075
"I suspect he was
having an affair.

786
00:38:41.158 --> 00:38:43.825
"I believe he's sleeping
with our baby-sitter Victoria.

787
00:38:43.908 --> 00:38:45.283
"It must be why
he keeps her around...

788
00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:48.033
"because we have
no children. "

789
00:38:48.117 --> 00:38:49.908
Cindy...

790
00:38:49.992 --> 00:38:53.200
I want you to know
what happened, Cindy.

791
00:39:01.992 --> 00:39:03.450
Hello, Cindy.

792
00:39:03.533 --> 00:39:05.283
Hello, Professor.

793
00:39:13.867 --> 00:39:15.700
I take it you're not
mad at me anymore.

794
00:39:15.783 --> 00:39:19.117
I wouldn't go that far,
Professor.

795
00:39:19.242 --> 00:39:20.742
Why don't you just relax?

796
00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:22.700
Hey!

797
00:39:22.825 --> 00:39:24.075
Uh, uh...

798
00:39:24.158 --> 00:39:25.908
Aha.

799
00:39:25.992 --> 00:39:27.367
Ha ha.

800
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.700
Uh-huh.

801
00:39:38.117 --> 00:39:40.325
I think she's starting
to suspect something.

802
00:39:40.408 --> 00:39:41.575
Who?

803
00:39:44.075 --> 00:39:44.992
Your wife.

804
00:39:45.075 --> 00:39:47.533
Aah!

805
00:39:50.242 --> 00:39:52.117
Oh, my God.

806
00:39:52.242 --> 00:39:53.325
It happened right here.

807
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:54.367
What?

808
00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:55.825
She came home.

809
00:39:55.908 --> 00:39:57.325
- She saw them!
- Saw who?

810
00:39:57.408 --> 00:40:00.033
I was in my room
reading her journal.

811
00:40:00.117 --> 00:40:03.325
Then I found this dress
in the closet.

812
00:40:03.408 --> 00:40:05.950
That's all I remember.

813
00:40:06.075 --> 00:40:07.492
What about you, Ray?

814
00:40:07.575 --> 00:40:09.325
Oh, I bought mine
on Friday.

815
00:40:09.408 --> 00:40:11.492
I just came down
to get a banana.

816
00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.117
Shit is hot, right?

817
00:40:14.242 --> 00:40:16.075
You're a nice little plant.

818
00:40:16.158 --> 00:40:18.700
You drink all this
little water up...

819
00:40:18.825 --> 00:40:21.617
so you can grow up to be
a nice strong charon plant.

820
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.450
Yes. Yes.

821
00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:25.575
And then you'll be smoked
by all the rappers...

822
00:40:25.658 --> 00:40:27.617
and make them do
a whole lot of dumb shit...

823
00:40:27.742 --> 00:40:29.117
that fuck up their careers.

824
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.950
Yes, you will.

825
00:40:32.658 --> 00:40:34.867
Night-night, baby.

826
00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:47.450
I'm gonna rob
that bitch tonight.

827
00:40:56.075 --> 00:40:58.283
Lockdown Records presents...

828
00:40:58.367 --> 00:40:59.950
A Hip-Hop Christmas.

829
00:41:00.033 --> 00:41:01.200
You'll get such classics...

830
00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.867
As "Santa Claus
Is Coming on Moms... "

831
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:04.700
That's the shit, son!

832
00:41:04.783 --> 00:41:06.700
"I'm Dreaming
of a White Woman... "

833
00:41:06.783 --> 00:41:08.867
and who could forget
"Frosty the Dopeman"?

834
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.867
And how about
"All I want for Christmas...

835
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:12.117
Is the Charges Dropped... "

836
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.325
"Deez Nuts Roasting
On an Open Fire... "

837
00:41:14.408 --> 00:41:16.242
"A Sleigh Ride In My '64... "

838
00:41:16.325 --> 00:41:17.908
"Ante Up, Bitch,
It's Christmas... "

839
00:41:17.992 --> 00:41:18.908
and many more!

840
00:41:18.992 --> 00:41:21.283
Yo, I'm gonna buy
that shit, son!

841
00:41:21.408 --> 00:41:23.283
Just $19. 95...

842
00:41:29.158 --> 00:41:30.158
Aah!

843
00:41:31.408 --> 00:41:33.783
I'm sorry! I didn't mean
to smoke your relatives!

844
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:35.533
Please! No!

845
00:41:35.617 --> 00:41:36.783
I didn't do it by myself!

846
00:41:36.908 --> 00:41:37.992
Whitney and Bobby helped me!

847
00:41:38.117 --> 00:41:39.992
Please! Help me!

848
00:41:40.075 --> 00:41:42.367
Aah! Shit, son!

849
00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.992
Wait! No! Please!

850
00:41:44.075 --> 00:41:46.908
Oh! Oh, shit, son!

851
00:41:46.992 --> 00:41:48.325
Oh, shit!

852
00:41:48.408 --> 00:41:49.908
Oh, my God!

853
00:41:52.617 --> 00:41:55.158
Aah! Oh, shit!
I smell something burning!

854
00:41:56.742 --> 00:41:58.575
Oh, stop! It's me!

855
00:41:58.658 --> 00:42:01.033
I got an idea!

856
00:42:01.117 --> 00:42:02.825
Oh, wait a second!

857
00:42:02.908 --> 00:42:04.325
Hold on, Shorty!

858
00:42:04.408 --> 00:42:05.492
Don't rescue me yet.

859
00:42:05.617 --> 00:42:07.408
I'm getting high
as a motherfucker!

860
00:42:07.492 --> 00:42:09.033
Toke, toke, toke, toke!

861
00:42:09.117 --> 00:42:11.158
Take it to the head!
Take it to the head!

862
00:42:12.533 --> 00:42:14.158
Oh, you take it
like a bitch.

863
00:42:14.242 --> 00:42:15.825
Put the Shorty down...

864
00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:17.950
and I'll give you
Funyons and Cheetos.

865
00:42:20.908 --> 00:42:23.117
Oh, shit!

866
00:42:23.242 --> 00:42:24.158
Oh, shit!

867
00:42:24.242 --> 00:42:26.200
This shit burns
more than a perm!

868
00:42:27.408 --> 00:42:28.867
Aah!

869
00:42:31.075 --> 00:42:32.950
Ha, ha, ha!

870
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:35.617
There's a whole lot
of freaky shit...

871
00:42:35.742 --> 00:42:37.700
going on in this house.

872
00:42:37.825 --> 00:42:40.117
There's more to this story
than the Professor told us.

873
00:42:40.242 --> 00:42:43.075
Last night,
I found a secret room...

874
00:42:43.158 --> 00:42:45.367
and I found all these
newspaper clippings...

875
00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.367
about Hugh Kane.

876
00:42:46.492 --> 00:42:49.367
He was a really evil man.

877
00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:53.367
And I found a picture
of his wife.

878
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:55.825
Oh, my God!
She looks just like you.

879
00:42:55.908 --> 00:42:56.992
You think?

880
00:42:57.075 --> 00:42:59.450
She doesn't have
as many split ends...

881
00:42:59.575 --> 00:43:01.783
and her skin's
not as oily as yours.

882
00:43:01.908 --> 00:43:03.492
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

883
00:43:03.575 --> 00:43:05.117
Sometimes you do this little
squinty thing with your eyes.

884
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.117
It looks like you got
Down Syndrome or something.

885
00:43:07.242 --> 00:43:09.283
Oh, yeah,
y'all look just alike...

886
00:43:09.367 --> 00:43:11.658
except she got
some perfect boobs...

887
00:43:11.742 --> 00:43:13.617
and yours look like
them old orangutan titties.

888
00:43:13.742 --> 00:43:15.700
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Shit, son!

889
00:43:15.783 --> 00:43:18.783
I'll put you in the full nelson
and lick them.

890
00:43:18.867 --> 00:43:20.450
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

891
00:43:20.533 --> 00:43:25.158
OK! Enough!

892
00:43:25.242 --> 00:43:27.700
Anyway, I think
she killed him...

893
00:43:27.783 --> 00:43:28.783
and now he wants me.

894
00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:30.658
Yeah. Right, bitch.

895
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.742
Morning, Dwight.
Let me help you.

896
00:43:48.825 --> 00:43:49.992
I don't need your help.

897
00:43:50.117 --> 00:43:51.450
I can do it myself.

898
00:43:51.533 --> 00:43:54.158
Aah!

899
00:43:55.783 --> 00:43:59.450
OK. Professor,
uh, we need to talk.

900
00:43:59.575 --> 00:44:00.825
What is it, Dwight?

901
00:44:00.908 --> 00:44:01.908
I think you should consider...

902
00:44:02.033 --> 00:44:03.867
cutting the experiment short.

903
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.325
What?

904
00:44:05.408 --> 00:44:07.783
This poltergeist is growing
increasingly more violent.

905
00:44:07.908 --> 00:44:09.408
I think we're all
in danger here...

906
00:44:09.492 --> 00:44:11.283
and I've got to put
my foot down...

907
00:44:11.367 --> 00:44:12.283
and stand up for
what I believe in...

908
00:44:12.408 --> 00:44:14.617
and say that
we've got to pull the plug.

909
00:44:14.742 --> 00:44:16.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Dwight.

910
00:44:17.033 --> 00:44:18.867
I say when we pull the plug.

911
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:21.408
We are on the verge
of greatness...

912
00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:24.825
and I am this close
to getting laid.

913
00:44:24.908 --> 00:44:26.325
Now, the bus arrives
on Monday.

914
00:44:26.408 --> 00:44:28.283
No one leaves till then.

915
00:44:28.408 --> 00:44:30.325
Here are
the keys to the gate.

916
00:44:30.408 --> 00:44:33.075
No one gets access to them.

917
00:44:33.158 --> 00:44:35.033
Yes, sir.

918
00:44:36.367 --> 00:44:39.450
Guys, I think
the Professor's up to something.

919
00:44:39.533 --> 00:44:41.117
I heard Dwight
tell the Professor...

920
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.450
there could be
a poltergeist in the house...

921
00:44:42.533 --> 00:44:44.658
and that we could all
be in danger!

922
00:44:44.742 --> 00:44:46.492
Oh, no, son!
Not a poltergeist!

923
00:44:47.867 --> 00:44:49.283
What's a poltergeist?

924
00:44:49.367 --> 00:44:50.367
I'm getting out of here.

925
00:44:50.533 --> 00:44:52.033
No. We can't go anywhere.
The gates are locked.

926
00:44:52.117 --> 00:44:53.617
Dwight's the only one
who has the keys.

927
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.575
- Baby, get my Vaseline.
- I'll handle-

928
00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.992
Get my Vaseline, a banana,
and some duct tape.

929
00:44:58.075 --> 00:44:58.992
I'm gonna break his legs.

930
00:44:59.075 --> 00:45:00.533
I'm gonna fuck
that little cripple up!

931
00:45:00.617 --> 00:45:03.742
Guys, just give me
five minutes alone with him.

932
00:45:03.825 --> 00:45:05.658
I'll get the keys.

933
00:45:11.117 --> 00:45:12.992
Hello, Dwight.

934
00:45:13.075 --> 00:45:15.367
Oh.

935
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.242
Hi, Theo.

936
00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:20.533
What you working on?

937
00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:25.117
Uh, just a little experiment.

938
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.617
Oh. Work, work, work.

939
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.700
Is that all you ever do?

940
00:45:29.825 --> 00:45:34.033
Well, there's a lot
riding on this project.

941
00:45:34.117 --> 00:45:35.950
You know, the Professor...

942
00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:37.658
might have
everyone else fooled...

943
00:45:37.742 --> 00:45:40.283
but I know
who the real brains...

944
00:45:40.367 --> 00:45:42.825
behind this operation is.

945
00:45:42.908 --> 00:45:45.783
Oh, yeah? You do, huh?

946
00:45:45.867 --> 00:45:48.992
Mm-hmm. That's what
turns me on about you.

947
00:45:49.075 --> 00:45:50.825
You're so smart.

948
00:45:50.908 --> 00:45:52.075
Ahh.

949
00:45:52.158 --> 00:45:55.492
And those sexy eyes.

950
00:45:55.575 --> 00:45:57.617
Ha ha. Oh!

951
00:46:00.033 --> 00:46:01.825
Why don't I put
some music on, huh?

952
00:46:01.908 --> 00:46:05.033
Yeah. Music.

953
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.617
Wha-

954
00:46:07.742 --> 00:46:09.617
You know, Dwight...

955
00:46:09.742 --> 00:46:10.908
I hear
you're the only one...

956
00:46:10.992 --> 00:46:13.200
who has
the keys to the gate.

957
00:46:13.283 --> 00:46:14.533
Uhh...

958
00:46:16.742 --> 00:46:18.867
Ha. That's true.
It is. I'm-

959
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:20.200
Correct.

960
00:46:20.283 --> 00:46:21.700
What if...

961
00:46:23.158 --> 00:46:25.200
I wanted to borrow
those keys?

962
00:46:25.325 --> 00:46:30.033
Oh, dear sweet God in Heaven.

963
00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.325
I... yaaa, I can't.

964
00:46:33.408 --> 00:46:36.033
Oh, come on.
Yes, you can, baby.

965
00:46:36.117 --> 00:46:37.742
- No.
- Please? I mean-

966
00:46:37.825 --> 00:46:41.742
Look. You help me
by giving me the keys...

967
00:46:41.867 --> 00:46:45.117
and I'll help by giving you...

968
00:46:45.242 --> 00:46:46.825
Hey, wait, wait, wait!
Whoa!

969
00:46:46.908 --> 00:46:49.200
Hey, I don't need
your help, OK, lady?

970
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:51.908
I can do it myself.

971
00:46:56.158 --> 00:46:57.950
Woo-hoo!

972
00:46:58.033 --> 00:46:58.950
Hey, look!

973
00:46:59.033 --> 00:47:00.117
I'm tossing my own salad!

974
00:47:00.242 --> 00:47:01.742
Ow!

975
00:47:10.908 --> 00:47:12.575
Oh.

976
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.533
So this is your secret room.

977
00:47:19.575 --> 00:47:21.867
Well...

978
00:47:21.992 --> 00:47:24.200
this just isn't
gonna work now, is it?

979
00:47:26.075 --> 00:47:30.242
Oh, Professor.

980
00:47:31.617 --> 00:47:34.825
Come over here.

981
00:47:36.783 --> 00:47:38.992
Uh-huh!

982
00:47:39.117 --> 00:47:42.700
This way, you big hunk.

983
00:47:42.825 --> 00:47:44.242
Ahem.

984
00:47:46.283 --> 00:47:48.325
Have we met?

985
00:47:48.408 --> 00:47:50.867
Follow me.

986
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.658
Are you playing
a little game?

987
00:47:52.742 --> 00:47:54.075
Where are you?

988
00:47:54.158 --> 00:47:57.367
Come here, baby.

989
00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:59.242
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

990
00:48:04.158 --> 00:48:06.533
No!

991
00:48:08.117 --> 00:48:08.783
Aah!

992
00:48:08.908 --> 00:48:10.075
- Is everybody here?
- Yeah.

993
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.867
All right. Let's go.

994
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:13.492
- Oh!
- Oh, shit, son!

995
00:48:17.283 --> 00:48:19.492
He's not gonna
let us out of here!

996
00:48:19.617 --> 00:48:20.700
He's gonna kill us!

997
00:48:20.783 --> 00:48:23.158
Oh, look.
A rocket scientist.

998
00:48:23.242 --> 00:48:24.867
All right. Quick.
Everybody to the laboratory.

999
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:27.950
Move! Come on! Hurry up!

1000
00:48:28.033 --> 00:48:29.742
You all are fucked!

1001
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.992
Lock the door.

1002
00:48:34.075 --> 00:48:36.283
OK. We have to destroy it.

1003
00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:37.283
That's great.

1004
00:48:37.408 --> 00:48:39.117
How are we gonna destroy
what we can't see?

1005
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.658
I got it!

1006
00:48:40.742 --> 00:48:42.283
We'll shave off
our pubic hairs...

1007
00:48:42.367 --> 00:48:45.408
and wear the shampoo
for two weeks!

1008
00:48:45.492 --> 00:48:46.658
No. Listen. Listen.

1009
00:48:46.742 --> 00:48:48.325
We're gonna use these guns.

1010
00:48:48.408 --> 00:48:51.283
They emit a bolt
of concentrated energy...

1011
00:48:51.367 --> 00:48:53.825
which can damage
the ectoplasmic cells...

1012
00:48:53.908 --> 00:48:55.158
and destroy the ghost.

1013
00:48:55.242 --> 00:48:57.367
Now, there's no more ammunition.

1014
00:48:57.450 --> 00:48:58.617
Conserve it. Use it wisely.

1015
00:48:58.742 --> 00:49:00.158
- Shut up.
- Ow!

1016
00:49:00.242 --> 00:49:03.033
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1017
00:49:03.117 --> 00:49:06.367
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Conserve your ammunition.

1018
00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:08.450
My bad.

1019
00:49:08.533 --> 00:49:09.617
All right.
Now, the only way...

1020
00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.033
we're gonna be able
to track these ghosts...

1021
00:49:11.117 --> 00:49:13.325
is if we're all wearing
one of these.

1022
00:49:13.408 --> 00:49:14.492
These are thermo goggles.

1023
00:49:14.575 --> 00:49:16.450
They work on the principle
of body heat.

1024
00:49:16.533 --> 00:49:18.658
They're so powerful,
they can detect...

1025
00:49:18.742 --> 00:49:20.283
where any bodily fluids
have been...

1026
00:49:20.367 --> 00:49:22.200
even if
they've been wiped clean.

1027
00:49:26.158 --> 00:49:27.075
What?

1028
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:29.158
Ew.

1029
00:49:29.242 --> 00:49:31.533
Are my glasses crooked?

1030
00:49:31.658 --> 00:49:34.658
Now listen,
that ghost may be invisible...

1031
00:49:34.742 --> 00:49:36.408
but we have the advantage
of being armed...

1032
00:49:36.492 --> 00:49:38.367
with the most sophisticated
high-tech equipment...

1033
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:39.533
known to man.

1034
00:49:39.617 --> 00:49:40.700
How do we stay in touch
with each other?

1035
00:49:40.825 --> 00:49:42.617
Do we have
some walkie-talkies?

1036
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.492
No. We have these.

1037
00:49:46.575 --> 00:49:47.992
Those is Dixie cups.

1038
00:49:48.075 --> 00:49:50.117
Well, we kind
of ran short of funds...

1039
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.117
after the guns
and the goggles.

1040
00:49:54.242 --> 00:49:56.117
All right.
Now let's split up.

1041
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.242
Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

1042
00:49:58.325 --> 00:49:59.992
Now wait a minute!
Hold up!

1043
00:50:00.075 --> 00:50:01.825
How come every time
some scary shit happens...

1044
00:50:01.908 --> 00:50:03.575
that we need
to stick together...

1045
00:50:03.658 --> 00:50:05.617
you white people always say,
"Let's split up"?

1046
00:50:05.742 --> 00:50:07.117
She's right.
We should stick together.

1047
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.950
Yes!
That's what I'm saying!

1048
00:50:09.033 --> 00:50:09.950
She's right.

1049
00:50:10.075 --> 00:50:13.242
OK. You three, follow me.

1050
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.367
Ain't that a bitch?

1051
00:50:25.033 --> 00:50:26.825
We're gonna die, y'all.

1052
00:50:35.825 --> 00:50:38.117
Ah. Did you hear that?

1053
00:50:38.242 --> 00:50:39.158
Hell, yeah.

1054
00:50:39.242 --> 00:50:42.492
Oh! Where's Shorty?

1055
00:50:42.575 --> 00:50:44.033
I don't know.

1056
00:50:44.117 --> 00:50:49.658
Shorty!

1057
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.617
Oh.

1058
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.617
Damn.

1059
00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.658
All right.
You wait right here.

1060
00:50:55.742 --> 00:50:56.658
I'll be right back.

1061
00:50:56.742 --> 00:50:58.617
- OK.
- All right.

1062
00:51:07.408 --> 00:51:09.450
- Wow.
- What is this?

1063
00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.450
I don't know.

1064
00:51:12.825 --> 00:51:15.283
Looks like the furnace room.

1065
00:51:15.367 --> 00:51:16.867
- Let's go.
- No, wait.

1066
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:18.325
In that newspaper article...

1067
00:51:18.408 --> 00:51:20.617
it said that Hugh Kane
was killed in the furnace.

1068
00:51:25.867 --> 00:51:30.200
Oh, wow. Look at this.

1069
00:51:30.283 --> 00:51:32.283
There's so many ashes, Buddy.

1070
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:36.783
What are you doing?

1071
00:51:36.867 --> 00:51:37.950
Hold it.

1072
00:51:38.033 --> 00:51:40.867
Aah!

1073
00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:43.783
Aah!

1074
00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.492
Let's split up.
I'll meet you on the other end.

1075
00:51:47.575 --> 00:51:49.700
- OK.
- Wait.

1076
00:51:49.783 --> 00:51:51.783
Good luck.

1077
00:51:51.867 --> 00:51:53.742
I love you!

1078
00:52:01.825 --> 00:52:02.908
Aah!

1079
00:52:02.992 --> 00:52:04.325
- Oh, Shorty!
- Cindy!

1080
00:52:04.408 --> 00:52:05.825
There's a monster chasing me.

1081
00:52:05.908 --> 00:52:08.117
What are we gonna do?

1082
00:52:08.242 --> 00:52:10.533
- I got it!
- Yeah?

1083
00:52:10.617 --> 00:52:11.950
Oh!

1084
00:52:14.408 --> 00:52:16.783
Shorty!

1085
00:52:16.908 --> 00:52:18.408
Shorty!

1086
00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:20.908
Aah!

1087
00:52:24.367 --> 00:52:25.950
Damn. Why does
the little bitch...

1088
00:52:26.033 --> 00:52:28.325
got to bring that shit
over here?

1089
00:52:28.408 --> 00:52:31.075
OK. Well, maybe
she won't see me.

1090
00:52:31.158 --> 00:52:33.783
Somebody help me! Brenda!

1091
00:52:36.325 --> 00:52:38.367
Shit, she saw me.

1092
00:52:38.492 --> 00:52:39.825
OK. OK.

1093
00:52:39.908 --> 00:52:41.367
Oh! Aah!

1094
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:42.867
Ohh!

1095
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.325
Thank you, Lord!

1096
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.617
Aah!

1097
00:52:47.742 --> 00:52:49.242
OK. Now let
that shit just-

1098
00:52:49.325 --> 00:52:51.700
just mutilate
her white ass and leave.

1099
00:52:56.242 --> 00:52:59.117
Damn, bitch, please die!

1100
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.825
Oh, my God, Brenda!
We're gonna die!

1101
00:53:01.908 --> 00:53:02.908
It would have
just been you...

1102
00:53:02.992 --> 00:53:05.450
if you had just
shut the fuck up!

1103
00:53:05.533 --> 00:53:06.950
It's coming!

1104
00:53:07.033 --> 00:53:08.533
What is it?

1105
00:53:08.617 --> 00:53:11.867
Is it a monster?
Is it a monster?

1106
00:53:15.117 --> 00:53:17.408
Cindy?

1107
00:53:17.533 --> 00:53:20.158
This is a skeleton.
This is bones.

1108
00:53:20.242 --> 00:53:22.617
Would you run
from Calista Flockhart?

1109
00:53:24.825 --> 00:53:26.367
Shut your ass up.

1110
00:53:27.992 --> 00:53:30.200
Ha, ha, ha!

1111
00:53:30.325 --> 00:53:33.158
Look. He crazy now.

1112
00:53:33.242 --> 00:53:35.283
I'm sorry, Mr. Skeleton.
Here.

1113
00:53:35.408 --> 00:53:38.617
Ha! Gotcha! Psych!

1114
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:39.867
Have a nice trip.

1115
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.700
Ha, ha, ha!

1116
00:53:43.783 --> 00:53:45.283
Hey, girl, I got an idea.

1117
00:53:45.367 --> 00:53:46.533
Come on.

1118
00:53:47.908 --> 00:53:50.283
Ha ha. Very funny.

1119
00:53:50.367 --> 00:53:52.158
Whoo!

1120
00:53:52.242 --> 00:53:53.492
Ooh!

1121
00:53:53.617 --> 00:53:55.658
Ha, ha, ha!

1122
00:53:55.742 --> 00:53:57.325
Now get on out of here!

1123
00:53:57.408 --> 00:53:58.867
Somebody gonna
catch an ass-whupping...

1124
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.117
when I come back.

1125
00:54:00.242 --> 00:54:02.617
Oh, Brenda,
you are so brave.

1126
00:54:02.742 --> 00:54:05.283
You know, you really are
my best friend, Cindy.

1127
00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:06.325
You guys OK?

1128
00:54:06.408 --> 00:54:07.658
- Yeah.
- Please.

1129
00:54:07.783 --> 00:54:10.867
It takes more than a little bag
of bones to scare me.

1130
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:11.867
Wedgie!

1131
00:54:11.992 --> 00:54:13.242
Ha, ha, ha!

1132
00:54:13.325 --> 00:54:14.575
The ghost has Buddy!

1133
00:54:14.658 --> 00:54:15.908
Ah! My ass!

1134
00:54:16.033 --> 00:54:17.658
Brenda, do something!

1135
00:54:17.742 --> 00:54:19.617
OK!

1136
00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.158
Aah!

1137
00:54:21.242 --> 00:54:22.992
I thought
I was your best friend.

1138
00:54:23.075 --> 00:54:24.158
Was.

1139
00:54:24.242 --> 00:54:26.117
I'm gonna miss you, girl!

1140
00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.283
Get my gun!

1141
00:54:39.617 --> 00:54:40.700
Oh!

1142
00:54:42.283 --> 00:54:44.033
Are you OK?

1143
00:54:44.117 --> 00:54:45.117
Ow.

1144
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.450
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

1145
00:54:46.575 --> 00:54:48.533
Come on. I think there's
a first-aid kit in the lab.

1146
00:54:48.617 --> 00:54:50.158
Come on.

1147
00:54:55.783 --> 00:54:58.242
Ooh!

1148
00:55:06.533 --> 00:55:10.450
Huey... baby...

1149
00:55:10.533 --> 00:55:12.408
where are you?

1150
00:55:16.283 --> 00:55:18.825
My love? Are you there?

1151
00:55:21.783 --> 00:55:24.242
Huey? Baby!

1152
00:55:24.325 --> 00:55:26.617
Baby, I got
to talk to you.

1153
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.950
- No. Go away!
- Baby? Oh!

1154
00:55:30.033 --> 00:55:31.200
Get away from me!

1155
00:55:31.283 --> 00:55:33.908
Come on, baby.
We can work this out.

1156
00:55:36.242 --> 00:55:38.283
I mean,
if we just stick together...

1157
00:55:38.408 --> 00:55:40.158
no one can hurt us,
my love.

1158
00:55:40.242 --> 00:55:42.450
It was just a booty call!

1159
00:55:43.867 --> 00:55:46.158
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!

1160
00:55:46.283 --> 00:55:47.200
Aah!

1161
00:55:47.283 --> 00:55:49.908
Why won't you talk to me?

1162
00:55:49.992 --> 00:55:51.158
Because you gave me crabs.

1163
00:55:51.283 --> 00:55:53.367
Aah!

1164
00:55:57.408 --> 00:56:00.283
You are the weakest link.
Good-bye!

1165
00:56:02.408 --> 00:56:03.658
Aah!

1166
00:56:06.033 --> 00:56:08.867
Ooh. Hey.

1167
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:11.408
How you doing?
Ha, ha, ha!

1168
00:56:16.908 --> 00:56:18.158
Aah!

1169
00:56:22.283 --> 00:56:24.242
No, no. No kissing.
No kissing.

1170
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.700
No. Leave this on.
Leave this on.

1171
00:56:28.783 --> 00:56:29.950
You look beautiful
just like that.

1172
00:56:30.075 --> 00:56:32.117
Yeah. Yeah. Oh! Oh!

1173
00:56:34.408 --> 00:56:37.992
Oh, shit!

1174
00:56:38.075 --> 00:56:38.992
Ohh!

1175
00:56:39.075 --> 00:56:40.658
No, no, no.

1176
00:56:40.742 --> 00:56:42.617
Don't fuck it up. Ohh.

1177
00:56:43.033 --> 00:56:45.033
I've been thinking about
this whole friendship thing.

1178
00:56:45.075 --> 00:56:46.700
I've never had a friend...

1179
00:56:46.783 --> 00:56:47.950
who cared for me
the way you do.

1180
00:56:48.075 --> 00:56:50.117
I mean, there's Ray...

1181
00:56:50.242 --> 00:56:51.658
but he cares for me
in a different way...

1182
00:56:51.742 --> 00:56:53.617
you know,
like bringing me flowers...

1183
00:56:53.742 --> 00:56:54.992
and running my bath water.

1184
00:56:55.075 --> 00:56:56.825
And there's nights
when I wake up screaming...

1185
00:56:56.908 --> 00:56:59.367
and I look over,
and Ray's in my bed holding me.

1186
00:57:01.033 --> 00:57:03.408
Anyway...

1187
00:57:03.575 --> 00:57:05.950
seeing as how tonight may be
our last night together...

1188
00:57:06.033 --> 00:57:07.200
I was thinking-

1189
00:57:07.325 --> 00:57:09.783
That we should take our
friendship a little bit further.

1190
00:57:09.867 --> 00:57:10.783
- Yes.
- Oh, Buddy!

1191
00:57:10.908 --> 00:57:12.950
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

1192
00:57:13.033 --> 00:57:16.367
This might be
our last night alive...

1193
00:57:16.492 --> 00:57:18.450
and I want to take
full advantage of it.

1194
00:57:18.533 --> 00:57:20.825
I was thinking the same thing!

1195
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.742
I want to be able to act out
our innermost fantasies.

1196
00:57:23.825 --> 00:57:25.700
Oh, great.

1197
00:57:25.783 --> 00:57:27.283
Like...

1198
00:57:27.367 --> 00:57:30.617
I've always wanted
to walk on the moon.

1199
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.367
Huh?

1200
00:57:39.075 --> 00:57:42.492
Buuuuudyyyy.

1201
00:57:42.575 --> 00:57:44.200
Ha, ha, ha!

1202
00:57:44.283 --> 00:57:46.325
What about you, Buddy?
What do you want to do?

1203
00:57:47.408 --> 00:57:49.283
Well...

1204
00:57:50.783 --> 00:57:52.200
He's in here.

1205
00:57:52.283 --> 00:57:53.367
Oh!

1206
00:58:00.617 --> 00:58:02.992
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1207
00:58:10.533 --> 00:58:11.950
Oh, my God.
He locked us in.

1208
00:58:12.033 --> 00:58:14.242
You should call for help.

1209
00:58:14.367 --> 00:58:17.158
Hello! Hello.
Can you hear me?

1210
00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.783
Come in! Come in!

1211
00:58:19.867 --> 00:58:22.325
Copy! Do you copy me?

1212
00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:24.908
We have a situation here!

1213
00:58:24.992 --> 00:58:26.158
Breaker!

1214
00:58:27.242 --> 00:58:28.825
Oh, my God.

1215
00:58:28.908 --> 00:58:30.325
They can't hear me!

1216
00:58:30.408 --> 00:58:32.950
Must be these walls
or something.

1217
00:58:37.908 --> 00:58:41.117
OK. All right.

1218
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:43.742
You stay down here.
I'll go check upstairs.

1219
00:58:43.867 --> 00:58:45.617
OK.

1220
00:58:51.533 --> 00:58:53.450
Ow!

1221
00:58:53.533 --> 00:58:54.617
Ah!

1222
00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:56.617
- Do you need help or-
- No!

1223
00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:57.950
OK.

1224
00:58:58.033 --> 00:58:59.492
What do I look like to you?

1225
00:58:59.575 --> 00:59:01.325
Just trying to be nice.

1226
00:59:01.408 --> 00:59:02.325
Cover me!

1227
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:03.617
What do you want me to do?

1228
00:59:03.742 --> 00:59:05.158
Cover me!

1229
00:59:05.242 --> 00:59:08.825
Not literally.
I'm serpentining!

1230
00:59:08.908 --> 00:59:10.367
They taught me that-

1231
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:13.242
Merchant marines.
Two years.

1232
00:59:13.325 --> 00:59:16.117
Spent two years
on my belly in Danang.

1233
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.950
- Yeah.
- Look!

1234
00:59:18.033 --> 00:59:20.242
Look. Look what
the cripple's doing.

1235
00:59:20.367 --> 00:59:22.492
Oh, shit.

1236
00:59:22.575 --> 00:59:24.533
Ow-ow-ow!

1237
00:59:24.617 --> 00:59:26.742
Look, I know you're proud.
Just let me help you up-

1238
00:59:26.867 --> 00:59:29.242
Step it back, candy pants!

1239
00:59:29.367 --> 00:59:30.783
Fine.

1240
00:59:33.533 --> 00:59:35.992
Oh, what are we gonna do?

1241
00:59:36.075 --> 00:59:37.158
I'm cold.

1242
00:59:37.242 --> 00:59:39.950
I can't feel my body,
I'm so cold.

1243
00:59:40.033 --> 00:59:41.450
Buddy, can you feel this?

1244
00:59:41.533 --> 00:59:42.450
No.

1245
00:59:42.533 --> 00:59:44.242
Try a little higher.

1246
00:59:44.325 --> 00:59:46.117
What about that?

1247
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.117
Mm-mmm.

1248
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:50.867
Keep rubbing. Ohh.

1249
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:55.117
Oh, Buddy,
I don't think I'm re-

1250
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.617
Cindy, please!
It's a matter of life and death.

1251
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.075
I'm asking you...

1252
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.242
in the name of love.

1253
01:00:06.825 --> 01:00:08.783
OK, Buddy.

1254
01:00:08.867 --> 01:00:11.325
In the name of love.

1255
01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:13.617
Ohh.

1256
01:00:15.617 --> 01:00:18.742
Mmm. Ohh.

1257
01:00:18.825 --> 01:00:20.575
Oh, Cindy...

1258
01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:23.408
I don't know how much longer
I can hold on.

1259
01:00:23.492 --> 01:00:25.325
Don't you say
your good-byes.

1260
01:00:25.408 --> 01:00:26.783
You're gonna
get out of here...

1261
01:00:26.867 --> 01:00:28.658
and you're gonna go on...

1262
01:00:28.742 --> 01:00:31.117
and you're gonna
have lots of little babies.

1263
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.033
And you're gonna
die an old man...

1264
01:00:33.117 --> 01:00:34.033
Old man.

1265
01:00:34.117 --> 01:00:35.867
Warm in his bed.

1266
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:37.367
- Not here!
- No.

1267
01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:39.533
- Not like this!
- Amen.

1268
01:00:39.617 --> 01:00:41.742
- Do you understand me?
- Oh, yeah.

1269
01:00:41.825 --> 01:00:43.867
Coming to this house
was the best thing...

1270
01:00:43.992 --> 01:00:45.450
that ever happened to me.

1271
01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:46.450
Oh, me, too.

1272
01:00:46.575 --> 01:00:49.825
And for that...
I am so thankful.

1273
01:00:49.908 --> 01:00:50.825
Oh, don't let go.

1274
01:00:50.908 --> 01:00:52.658
Never!
I'll never let go!

1275
01:00:52.742 --> 01:00:54.617
- I feel weak.
- Buddy!

1276
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:55.950
- I'm com-
- Come back!

1277
01:00:56.033 --> 01:00:57.033
Aah!

1278
01:00:59.283 --> 01:01:01.033
All right, Dwight Hartman...

1279
01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:04.242
it's your time to shine.

1280
01:01:04.325 --> 01:01:06.283
All right. Come on.

1281
01:01:12.617 --> 01:01:14.908
Come on, Kane.

1282
01:01:15.033 --> 01:01:16.825
Show yourself!

1283
01:01:16.908 --> 01:01:18.408
Look. I don't even need
my thermal goggles.

1284
01:01:23.033 --> 01:01:24.117
Aah!

1285
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:26.867
Ha, ha, ha!

1286
01:01:28.492 --> 01:01:29.575
Oh!

1287
01:01:29.658 --> 01:01:31.367
Aah!

1288
01:01:33.075 --> 01:01:34.825
Ah. Ah.

1289
01:01:39.992 --> 01:01:41.825
Ow!

1290
01:01:45.617 --> 01:01:48.742
That's right, mother-

1291
01:01:48.825 --> 01:01:49.992
Ha, ha, ha!

1292
01:01:50.075 --> 01:01:50.992
Whoa!

1293
01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:52.700
Ow-ow-ow!

1294
01:01:52.783 --> 01:01:53.783
Ha, ha, ha!

1295
01:01:53.867 --> 01:01:55.992
Aah!

1296
01:01:56.075 --> 01:01:57.450
Hey, Kane, you hungry?

1297
01:01:57.533 --> 01:01:59.575
How about
a little snack of this?

1298
01:01:59.658 --> 01:02:01.033
Ha ha!

1299
01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.033
Aah!

1300
01:02:03.117 --> 01:02:06.242
Ow. Ow. No. Ow.

1301
01:02:06.325 --> 01:02:08.033
Ow-ow-ow.

1302
01:02:14.033 --> 01:02:15.367
Gotcha!

1303
01:02:21.408 --> 01:02:25.450
Aaargh!

1304
01:02:27.825 --> 01:02:29.075
I know what you're thinking.

1305
01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.033
Did I fire 3 shots or 117?

1306
01:02:33.158 --> 01:02:36.575
Well, do you feel lucky...

1307
01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.117
punk?

1308
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.283
Do you... feel lucky?

1309
01:02:41.367 --> 01:02:42.783
Do you feel lucky, punk?

1310
01:02:42.867 --> 01:02:44.033
Shoot me, motherfucker!

1311
01:02:50.575 --> 01:02:52.700
OK. Fine.

1312
01:02:52.825 --> 01:02:55.033
Make your best move, ass bite.

1313
01:03:11.242 --> 01:03:13.950
- Raaa!
- Aaah!

1314
01:03:16.825 --> 01:03:19.575
Oh. Whayaaa!

1315
01:03:19.658 --> 01:03:21.075
Whoa!

1316
01:03:21.158 --> 01:03:22.325
Whoo!

1317
01:03:24.325 --> 01:03:25.492
Aah!

1318
01:03:36.033 --> 01:03:37.283
Uh.

1319
01:03:37.408 --> 01:03:39.033
Help!

1320
01:03:40.367 --> 01:03:41.283
Help!

1321
01:03:41.367 --> 01:03:43.992
Here. Take my hand.

1322
01:03:44.075 --> 01:03:45.450
Ahh!

1323
01:03:45.533 --> 01:03:46.992
Come on.

1324
01:03:47.075 --> 01:03:49.200
You're gonna fall
unless you take my hand...

1325
01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:50.575
No. Give me
your other hand.

1326
01:03:50.658 --> 01:03:53.492
No. My other hand
isn't strong enough.

1327
01:03:53.575 --> 01:03:54.742
You take my little hand.

1328
01:03:54.825 --> 01:03:56.575
No! Get it away from me!

1329
01:03:56.658 --> 01:03:59.200
Take it! Take my hand!

1330
01:03:59.325 --> 01:04:02.908
Aah!

1331
01:04:04.242 --> 01:04:06.117
Eww.

1332
01:04:10.075 --> 01:04:10.992
No.

1333
01:04:11.075 --> 01:04:11.992
No. Why me?

1334
01:04:12.075 --> 01:04:13.450
No. Come on. No.

1335
01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:15.992
I've served you well.
Don't you do this to me.

1336
01:04:16.075 --> 01:04:17.950
No, please. Please, no.

1337
01:04:18.075 --> 01:04:20.992
Ple-ple-ple-Aah!

1338
01:04:21.492 --> 01:04:23.033
OK, Buddy.

1339
01:04:23.117 --> 01:04:25.825
It's time for us
to get out of here.

1340
01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.158
Roger. Roger.
Come in, Roger.

1341
01:05:00.242 --> 01:05:01.325
Ray, this is Cindy.

1342
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:02.450
I don't want
to talk to Cindy.

1343
01:05:02.533 --> 01:05:03.617
I want to talk to Roger.

1344
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:05.617
Roger, where you at, man?
Quit fucking around.

1345
01:05:05.742 --> 01:05:07.408
Ray, listen.
The ghost is close.

1346
01:05:07.492 --> 01:05:09.117
He almost got us.
Buddy's hurt.

1347
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.492
- What's your location?
- I'm right behind you.

1348
01:05:11.617 --> 01:05:13.825
Ray, thank God.
OK. Where's Shorty?

1349
01:05:13.908 --> 01:05:15.783
I don't-I don't know.

1350
01:05:15.908 --> 01:05:17.325
He was here
just a minute ago.

1351
01:05:17.408 --> 01:05:19.367
Listen,
you go help Buddy in the lab.

1352
01:05:19.492 --> 01:05:22.117
- I'll go check upstairs.
- All right.

1353
01:05:23.242 --> 01:05:26.492
Mmm. That smells good.

1354
01:05:26.575 --> 01:05:27.575
Hello, Cindy.

1355
01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.908
Say heloo to Cindy, Shorty.

1356
01:05:30.992 --> 01:05:34.742
Heloo... Cindy.

1357
01:05:34.867 --> 01:05:35.783
Shorty, are you OK?

1358
01:05:35.867 --> 01:05:37.492
Talk to me!

1359
01:05:37.575 --> 01:05:40.825
Morphine? Chloroform?

1360
01:05:40.908 --> 01:05:42.492
Horse tranquilizers?
You drugged him!

1361
01:05:42.575 --> 01:05:45.117
I did not.
That's all his stuff.

1362
01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.117
Yaah!

1363
01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:47.783
All right, Shorty.

1364
01:05:47.867 --> 01:05:49.450
Who's ready
for the main course?

1365
01:05:49.533 --> 01:05:51.075
Me! Me.

1366
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.950
Oh, Hanson, please.

1367
01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:55.325
No. Oh.

1368
01:05:57.033 --> 01:05:58.033
What the fuck?

1369
01:05:58.117 --> 01:05:59.658
Beetlejuice in the house.

1370
01:05:59.742 --> 01:06:02.992
This is your brains
on drugs. Hee!

1371
01:06:03.075 --> 01:06:04.908
Oof.

1372
01:06:04.992 --> 01:06:06.325
Oh, shit, son.

1373
01:06:06.408 --> 01:06:09.450
Aah!

1374
01:06:09.575 --> 01:06:11.617
Oh.

1375
01:06:14.825 --> 01:06:16.075
Shorty!

1376
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.617
Got me.

1377
01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.617
Cindy, what's going on?

1378
01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.617
It's Hanson.
He's possessed.

1379
01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.700
Let's get him.

1380
01:06:58.992 --> 01:07:01.283
Whoo!

1381
01:07:01.408 --> 01:07:02.908
Ahh.

1382
01:07:02.992 --> 01:07:04.075
Angel style!

1383
01:07:06.492 --> 01:07:09.242
Hi-yah!

1384
01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:10.492
Aah!

1385
01:07:13.158 --> 01:07:14.325
Aah!

1386
01:07:18.408 --> 01:07:19.575
Uh!

1387
01:07:28.825 --> 01:07:31.908
Whoo! OK.

1388
01:07:31.992 --> 01:07:34.200
Boo!

1389
01:07:34.325 --> 01:07:35.242
Come on.

1390
01:07:35.367 --> 01:07:36.617
Aah!

1391
01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:37.658
- Oh!
- Aah!

1392
01:07:37.742 --> 01:07:39.075
Smack my bitch up

1393
01:07:39.158 --> 01:07:40.575
Aah!

1394
01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:53.867
OK.

1395
01:07:56.158 --> 01:07:57.075
Aaaaaaah...

1396
01:07:57.158 --> 01:07:59.200
Oh, nooo!

1397
01:07:59.283 --> 01:08:00.950
Oh!

1398
01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:03.158
Ohh.

1399
01:08:03.242 --> 01:08:05.533
Hee, hee, hee! Ooh!

1400
01:08:05.658 --> 01:08:07.117
Aah!

1401
01:08:13.533 --> 01:08:14.450
Hi-yi!

1402
01:08:15.783 --> 01:08:17.658
Aah!

1403
01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.075
Aah!

1404
01:08:23.158 --> 01:08:24.075
Whoo!

1405
01:08:26.992 --> 01:08:29.367
Whoo! Oh! Ooh!

1406
01:08:42.075 --> 01:08:43.075
Ooh!

1407
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:06.950
Ow.

1408
01:09:07.075 --> 01:09:07.992
Shit.

1409
01:09:11.825 --> 01:09:15.492
Ahh!

1410
01:09:15.575 --> 01:09:17.533
You OK, Dwight?

1411
01:09:17.617 --> 01:09:20.617
I- I can't feel my legs.

1412
01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:25.700
Aah!
I can't feel my legs!

1413
01:09:25.783 --> 01:09:27.033
You never could.

1414
01:09:27.158 --> 01:09:28.533
You stay out of this,
all right?

1415
01:09:28.617 --> 01:09:29.992
Now listen.

1416
01:09:30.075 --> 01:09:31.825
You get the others
and meet us upstairs.

1417
01:09:31.908 --> 01:09:32.825
- All right?
- OK.

1418
01:09:32.908 --> 01:09:33.992
You stay here.

1419
01:09:34.117 --> 01:09:36.825
Ray-Ray, I need your help.
Give me your belt.

1420
01:09:36.908 --> 01:09:37.825
- Hi-yah!
- Hah!

1421
01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:39.200
Heee!

1422
01:09:39.325 --> 01:09:41.200
Hmmm. The crane.

1423
01:09:43.742 --> 01:09:44.825
Ha!

1424
01:09:46.033 --> 01:09:48.325
The crouching tiger.

1425
01:09:53.408 --> 01:09:55.117
The drunken monkey.

1426
01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.408
Ooh, ooh, ooh
ah, ah, ah!

1427
01:09:59.033 --> 01:10:00.117
The mad cow.

1428
01:10:02.908 --> 01:10:06.283
Motherfucker! Moo!

1429
01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:07.783
Aah!

1430
01:10:07.867 --> 01:10:09.408
The camel toe.

1431
01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:12.783
Yow-hi!

1432
01:10:32.075 --> 01:10:33.950
Get the hell
out of there, guys!

1433
01:10:34.033 --> 01:10:35.033
Come on!

1434
01:10:41.033 --> 01:10:43.158
Ray, give me a 180.

1435
01:10:43.283 --> 01:10:45.200
OK. Listen.
Someone has to go...

1436
01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:47.825
and lure him
onto that platform.

1437
01:10:51.825 --> 01:10:54.117
All right. I'll go.

1438
01:10:54.242 --> 01:10:55.158
Cindy, let me-

1439
01:10:55.242 --> 01:10:56.825
No, Buddy!

1440
01:10:56.908 --> 01:10:58.242
I'm the one he wants.

1441
01:10:58.325 --> 01:10:59.992
Actually, I was saying...

1442
01:11:00.075 --> 01:11:02.033
let me have your computer
if you die.

1443
01:11:02.117 --> 01:11:04.158
Oh.

1444
01:11:04.242 --> 01:11:05.408
OK. But as soon as
he gets there...

1445
01:11:05.492 --> 01:11:06.742
you have to get off.

1446
01:11:06.867 --> 01:11:08.450
OK.

1447
01:11:08.533 --> 01:11:09.700
All right. 180 me.

1448
01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.742
Hugh Kane, it's me you want!

1449
01:11:13.825 --> 01:11:15.242
Come get me!

1450
01:11:15.325 --> 01:11:17.783
I'm not afraid anymore!

1451
01:11:17.867 --> 01:11:19.492
Show yourself!

1452
01:11:22.408 --> 01:11:24.033
Aah! Oh!

1453
01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.450
Aah!

1454
01:11:31.367 --> 01:11:32.825
Ooh.

1455
01:11:40.825 --> 01:11:42.158
Dwight, he's here.
Do something.

1456
01:11:42.242 --> 01:11:43.700
I can't.
She's still on the platform.

1457
01:11:43.783 --> 01:11:45.283
If I throw the switch,
she'll die.

1458
01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:46.700
Cindy, get out of there!
You'll get killed!

1459
01:11:46.783 --> 01:11:48.242
Aah!

1460
01:11:48.325 --> 01:11:49.575
Ha, ha, ha!

1461
01:11:49.658 --> 01:11:50.658
Move out of the way!

1462
01:11:50.783 --> 01:11:52.242
I'll get her!

1463
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:56.117
Why is he running so slow?

1464
01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.283
Ray! Run faster!

1465
01:11:58.367 --> 01:11:59.283
OK!

1466
01:11:59.408 --> 01:12:01.950
Throw the switch!

1467
01:12:02.033 --> 01:12:04.033
Now you will be mine...
forever!

1468
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.658
Ray, you saved me.

1469
01:12:18.742 --> 01:12:19.908
Are you OK?

1470
01:12:20.033 --> 01:12:20.950
I'm fine.

1471
01:12:21.075 --> 01:12:22.617
I broke my fall.

1472
01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:25.075
Ohh. Ah.

1473
01:12:38.533 --> 01:12:40.242
Oh.

1474
01:12:41.783 --> 01:12:42.700
- Yes!
- Yes!

1475
01:12:44.783 --> 01:12:47.450
Hey, y'all.
What's going on?

1476
01:12:47.533 --> 01:12:49.992
Shorty, you made it.
You're alive!

1477
01:12:54.825 --> 01:12:57.367
Yeah.
It was traumatic.

1478
01:12:57.492 --> 01:12:59.117
It really was...

1479
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.408
and it's taking me
a while to get over it,

1480
01:13:01.492 --> 01:13:02.908
but, you know...

1481
01:13:02.992 --> 01:13:06.367
now that we're out of the house
and back in school...

1482
01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.533
I just know that
everything's gonna be OK.

1483
01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:12.033
Oh, God,
will you shut the fuck up?

1484
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.575
Why couldn't you have
just left me there to die?

1485
01:13:14.658 --> 01:13:16.700
Give me a fucking rope.
I'll hang myself.

1486
01:13:16.783 --> 01:13:18.992
Here I go.
I'm hanging myself.

1487
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:23.283
Hello?

1488
01:13:23.367 --> 01:13:25.283
Oh, hi, Dad.

1489
01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:27.908
Are you having fun
on your vacation?

1490
01:13:27.992 --> 01:13:30.200
Oh, no. Birds are
very clean animals.

1491
01:13:30.283 --> 01:13:31.367
He's no trouble at all.

1492
01:13:31.492 --> 01:13:32.492
Goddamn it!

1493
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.700
What the fuck
did you put in this birdseed?

1494
01:13:40.158 --> 01:13:42.033
Oh, Dad, Buddy's here.
I got to go.

1495
01:13:42.158 --> 01:13:43.158
OK. I love you. Bye.

1496
01:13:43.242 --> 01:13:45.450
God, that was a big one.

1497
01:13:45.575 --> 01:13:48.033
- Hey, Buddy!
- Surprise.

1498
01:13:48.158 --> 01:13:49.408
Open chest!

1499
01:13:49.492 --> 01:13:53.408
Oh! You got to be quicker
than that, pencil dick.

1500
01:13:53.492 --> 01:13:55.075
Come on.

1501
01:13:56.658 --> 01:13:58.408
Hey, look out. A bee.

1502
01:13:58.492 --> 01:13:59.867
Buddy,
I've never had anyone...

1503
01:13:59.950 --> 01:14:02.242
be so protective
of me before.

1504
01:14:02.325 --> 01:14:03.742
That's what your man's
supposed to do.

1505
01:14:03.825 --> 01:14:05.783
Two hot dogs.

1506
01:14:10.908 --> 01:14:11.992
Buddy, get him!

1507
01:14:12.117 --> 01:14:14.492
Buddy? Buddy?

1508
01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:16.075
I've come back for you.

1509
01:14:16.158 --> 01:14:17.742
No! This can't be happening!

1510
01:14:17.825 --> 01:14:20.367
Mm-hmm.
It is happening.

1511
01:14:20.492 --> 01:14:23.367
Now we're gonna be
together forever.

1512
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:25.367
Nooooo!

1513
01:14:25.825 --> 01:14:31.408
Yes!

1514
01:14:34.283 --> 01:14:35.533
Did you hear something?

1515
01:14:35.617 --> 01:14:39.033
No. I didn't hear nothing.

1516
01:14:39.117 --> 01:14:40.575
Ohh.
