00:00:50.343 --> 00:00:52.512
Hey, do you guys know this one?

2
00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:56.683
Now, this is the real shit.

3
00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:28.381
You suck.

4
00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:44.689
Who put the horse out?

5
00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:54.741
She's good.

6
00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:01.247
She... She's been really sick.

7
00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.169
Bad, bad, bad girl!

8
00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:15.094
Okay. That'll be $17.50.

9
00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.014
Hey, buddy! Hey, pay the fare.

10
00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:24.270
I'm Father McFeely.

11
00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:25.563
I'm so glad you're here.

12
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.565
I came as fast as I could,

13
00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:29.918
but at my age, the little soldier needs
a lot more thumping

14
00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:32.111
before it starts pumping,
if you know what I mean.

15
00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:33.756
You know, I do find, though,
if I tickle my asshole

16
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.367
- just before I unleash the dog of war...
- It's okay. It's okay. I understand.

17
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.037
You know, because in the old days,
you know, when you...

18
00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:44.499
How is she?

19
00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:46.959
It's gotten worse, Father.

20
00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:48.795
Really?

21
00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:51.964
She won't eat, she won't talk.

22
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.386
The child won't even let me touch her.

23
00:02:56.594 --> 00:02:59.430
Yes. Sometimes you
have to give them candy.

24
00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:05.269
Father. The church sent me to assist you.
I'm Father Harris.

25
00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:07.271
- Hi. Nice to see you.
- Hi.

26
00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:09.607
Would you like to see the girl?

27
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:11.901
Soon.

28
00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.321
But first I must bless this house.

29
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.466
"The sorrows of death compassed me,

30
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.927
"and the pains of hell got hold upon me.

31
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.011
"I found..."

32
00:03:41.347 --> 00:03:44.100
"Then called I upon
the name of the Lord and..."

33
00:03:58.614 --> 00:03:59.615
"My soul from death."

34
00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:03.035
Oh, God. Please, Lord.

35
00:04:03.536 --> 00:04:06.372
Help me to release this demon.

36
00:04:11.377 --> 00:04:15.089
Thank you, Lord,
the most merciful almighty.

37
00:04:15.173 --> 00:04:16.924
Hold on.

38
00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:22.722
Those enchiladas.

39
00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:27.310
Thank you, Lord.

40
00:04:47.622 --> 00:04:48.956
Fuck this.

41
00:04:49.832 --> 00:04:51.042
Father!

42
00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:54.587
- Fuck! Did you see this? Look at this!
- Please, Father, think of the child.

43
00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:55.755
Fuck!

44
00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:56.923
Yes.

45
00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:05.890
It's freezing.

46
00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:25.660
Let us pray.

47
00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:28.120
"Defender of the human race,

48
00:05:28.496 --> 00:05:30.957
"look down in pity upon this, your servant."

49
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.126
Shove it up your ass,
you worthless piece of shit.

50
00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:36.796
Silence!

51
00:05:38.923 --> 00:05:40.049
"Holy Lord..."

52
00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:41.884
Your mother is in here with us, Harris.

53
00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:44.971
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll be sure that she gets it.

54
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:47.807
Yes. Mom, will you get out of there, please?

55
00:05:49.976 --> 00:05:51.060
You're no fun.

56
00:05:51.477 --> 00:05:52.520
I'm working.

57
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.564
See you later, Mrs. Harris.

58
00:05:54.814 --> 00:05:57.400
"Holy Lord, almighty father in..."

59
00:05:58.359 --> 00:06:01.487
"Everlasting God
"and father of our Lord Jesus Christ

60

65
00:06:21.924 --> 00:06:23.843
Fuck me! Fuck me!

66
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:26.345
Father!

67
00:06:27.263 --> 00:06:28.598
Father!

68
00:06:28.723 --> 00:06:30.766
This is not part of the ritual.

69
00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:35.313
In the name of the father, the son,
and the holy...

70
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.773
Here you go, Father. All clean.

71
00:07:01.797 --> 00:07:03.215
Thank you so much.

72
00:07:03.883 --> 00:07:04.884
Okay.

73
00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:11.265
You failed, McFeely.
Your weapons are useless against me.

74
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.976
Let us pray.

75
00:07:14.477 --> 00:07:17.117
- Our father who art in heaven...
- Our father who art in heaven...

76
00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:19.899
Stop it!

77
00:07:20.358 --> 00:07:22.198
- Hallowed be thy name.
- Hallowed be thy name.

78
00:07:22.777 --> 00:07:23.819
Zip it.

79
00:07:23.903 --> 00:07:24.945
Thy kingdom come.

80
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:27.490
Your mother sucks cocks in hell.

81
00:07:28.324 --> 00:07:29.533
Shit!

82
00:07:32.244 --> 00:07:33.329
Suck on this.

83
00:08:03.693 --> 00:08:05.695
So, you think you made it
into the class, Shorty?

84
00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:07.071
I sure hope so, Cindy.

85
00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:08.698
You could use the grade, huh?

86
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:10.908
Nah. I need a place to stay.

87
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.493
Mom dukes kicked me out.

88
00:08:13.035 --> 00:08:16.205
But you know something? I learned
something very important in college.

89
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:18.499
- The value of books.
- Really?

90
00:08:18.624 --> 00:08:19.625
Yeah. Look at this here.

91
00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:24.797
Free paper. Shit, son.

92
00:08:26.465 --> 00:08:28.217
Yeah, so how you digging college?

93
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.137
I don't know. It's okay, I guess.

94
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.306
I feel like such a geek sometimes, though.

95
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.059
Everyone is so cool, and I'm not.

96
00:08:37.143 --> 00:08:38.853
Come on, Cindy.

97
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:40.521
You ain't that bad.

98
00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:42.815
All you need is a little bit of flavour.

99
00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:45.067
- Maybe some new gear.
- "Gear"?

100
00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:46.671
You know, that's slang for "clothing."

101
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.906
Here. Let me... Come on.
We gonna cool you up right now.

102
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.743
Come on. Don't sit like this, first of all.

103
00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:55.703
Don't sit like that, son. Sit cool.

104
00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.747
- Okay.
- Right up, son.

105
00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.832
Yeah. Feel yourself, son, like that.

106
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:01.667
Yeah. Now go like this.

107
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:04.920
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

108
00:09:05.004 --> 00:09:06.964
Yeah. Now stand up,
let me show you some moves.

109
00:09:07.173 --> 00:09:09.508
- Right, left. Right, left.
- Right, left. Right, left.

110
00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:11.343
Son.

111
00:09:11.677 --> 00:09:12.928
- Right, left.
- Right, left.

112
00:09:13.012 --> 00:09:14.132
- Right, kick.
- Right, kick.

113
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.181
- Son.
- Son.

114
00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:16.432
- Psych.
- Psych.

115
00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:20.478
Throw a little bit of slang in there.
Say, "Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

116
00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:21.729
"Ya mean?"

117
00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:23.856
Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

118
00:09:23.939 --> 00:09:25.983
- Ya mean?
- Ya mean?

119
00:09:26.609 --> 00:09:28.611
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

120
00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:29.820
Throw it all together.

121
00:09:29.904 --> 00:09:31.614
Okay. Right, left.

122
00:09:31.697 --> 00:09:33.157
Right, kick.

123
00:09:33.532 --> 00:09:35.159
Yo, that jacket is tight.

124
00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:38.037
Now run that shit, bitch. Ya mean?

125
00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:42.541
That is the shit, dog.

126
00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:45.836
Man. You boners aren't ready yet?

127
00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.840
Dude, relax, man. I'm telling you,
we'll get there on time, all right?

128
00:09:49.924 --> 00:09:51.717
Yo, dogs, what y'all think?

129
00:09:51.884 --> 00:09:53.385
Tucked in or out?

130
00:09:54.929 --> 00:09:56.305
- Out, man.
- Out, man. Come on.

131
00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:58.533
No doubt. No doubt. That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.

132
00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:00.994
Yeah, you fuckheads would be ready
if you weren't partying all night.

133
00:10:01.018 --> 00:10:04.939
Come on, man. It was so awesome.
We got so wasted, man!

134
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:06.899
I had, like, a keg myself.

135
00:10:06.982 --> 00:10:09.026
I woke up naked in a tub of ice.

136
00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:11.070
- All right!
- Yeah, man.

137
00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:14.532
Shit, Ray, you got a tattoo.

138
00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:17.076
Shit. What's it say?

139
00:10:17.243 --> 00:10:18.828
"Ray"!
- Oh, man.

140
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.038
Shit, you got a tattoo, too.

141
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.373
- Really? Dude!
- Yeah.

142
00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:24.250
Dude, what... What's it say?

143
00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.294
- "Fucked me."
- Sweet, man.

144
00:10:27.378 --> 00:10:28.754
- "Ray..."
- "Fucked me."

145
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.173
- "Ray..."
- "Fucked me."

146
00:10:31.257 --> 00:10:33.008
- "Ray fucked me."
- "Ray fucked me."

147
00:10:33.092 --> 00:10:34.426
Yeah!

148
00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.346
What, man?

149
00:10:39.348 --> 00:10:40.891
Wedgie moment!

150
00:10:41.267 --> 00:10:44.353
Come on.
You're gonna give me a yeast infection.

151
00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.689
Hey, girl, that jacket is slamming.

152
00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:48.208
- Thanks.
- You better be careful, though.

153
00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:51.318
Some girl got her ass whipped
and her little jacket stolen earlier today.

154
00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:53.404
Some people is so ghetto.

155
00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:56.740
- What class we got next?
- Psychology.

156
00:10:56.824 --> 00:10:59.118
Me, too! 101?

157
00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:01.620
- In room 302 at 10:00?
- That's it!

158
00:11:01.704 --> 00:11:04.582
No. This is too much.

159
00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:06.750
I got these psychic powers on lock.

160
00:11:06.834 --> 00:11:08.474
Remind me to get a lotto ticket tomorrow.

161
00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:10.421
Don't split the pole now.

162
00:11:10.504 --> 00:11:13.632
That is very, very bad luck.
My psychic told me.

163
00:11:13.716 --> 00:11:15.556
You don't really
believe in that stuff, do you?

164
00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:17.386
Yes, I do. Very much.

165
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.270
{\an8}- Are these all the subjects?
- Yes, sir.

166
00:11:26.437 --> 00:11:28.915
I took the liberty of putting those
with near-death experiences

167
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:29.940
on the very top.

168
00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:31.400
Any of them hot?

169
00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:34.987
As I'm sure you are aware, Professor,

170
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.865
subjects who are close to death
are statistically more likely

171
00:11:37.948 --> 00:11:40.868
to have the suggestibility required
for paranormal investigation,

172
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:45.205
which is why, of course,
I gave them special consideration.

173
00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:46.832
Good thinking, Dwight.

174
00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.585
Traumatized coeds are a sure thing.

175
00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:53.756
I like her.

176
00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:56.133
Yes, sir. That is Cindy Campbell.

177
00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.636
A classic abandoned personality disorder.

178
00:11:59.178 --> 00:12:00.512
She seems guarded, but willing.

179
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.973
And this?

180
00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:04.475
That is Ray Wilkins, sir.

181
00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:06.101
I couldn't quite figure him out,

182
00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:08.771
but he seemed very eager
and pleased to meet me.

183
00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.023
What's this?

184
00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:15.819
{\an8}It's a picture that he sent after the interview.

185
00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:18.155
Where did you find these kids?

186
00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:21.867
Sir, they're all survivors
of the Stevenston County massacre.

187
00:12:23.369 --> 00:12:25.329
Fantastic!

188
00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:29.625
These kids are exactly the catalyst we need

189
00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:33.045
to awaken the spirits of Hell House.

190
00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:37.466
Sir, exactly how are we
going to get them up there?

191
00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:40.552
We'll tell them it's part of the class.

192
00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:43.013
We'll say... Excuse me.

193
00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:47.267
That they're participating in a study
of sleep disorders.

194
00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.395
We are going to make history, Dwight.

195
00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:51.814
The first documented,

196
00:12:52.064 --> 00:12:56.193
unrefuted evidence of life after death.

197
00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:57.736
<i>Welcome, everybody.</i>

198
00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:59.738
I'm Professor Oldman.

199
00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:04.243
Each of you have been carefully selected
to be in this class

200
00:13:04.326 --> 00:13:09.289
for which you receive an automatic
grade of A upon completion.

201
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.669
Now, this year's study is insomnia.

202
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.464
We are going to spend the weekend together

203
00:13:17.548 --> 00:13:19.883
where we've established
a controlled environment

204
00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:23.595
in which we'll study
your various sleep disorders.

205
00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.473
Now, I'll be passing out directions...

206
00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:28.475
- I can do it.
- I can... No.

207
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.852
- No, Dwight.
- I can do it.

208
00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:33.105
I can myself do it.

209
00:13:34.023 --> 00:13:37.443
Now, you should all be there
by 6:00 pm. Tonight

210
00:13:38.027 --> 00:13:40.070
and plan to stay through Monday.

211
00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:41.822
I'll see you all this evening.

212
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:43.866
Hey!

213
00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:46.785
- You left your book back there.
- Thanks.

214
00:13:48.412 --> 00:13:49.538
I'm Cindy.

215
00:13:49.705 --> 00:13:51.123
- Buddy.
- Hey.

216
00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:54.334
So, looks like we're gonna spend
the weekend together.

217
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.587
- Yeah.
- You want to get together and

218
00:13:57.755 --> 00:13:58.881
study or something?

219
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.175
Study?

220
00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:03.635
That was kind of bad.

221
00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.305
I'm sorry, Buddy.

222
00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:07.931
You seem like a really nice guy,

223
00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:11.477
but I just got out
of a really bad relationship,

224
00:14:11.602 --> 00:14:14.313
so I'm not quite ready to start dating yet.

225
00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:18.484
But, hey, you know,
maybe we could be friends.

226
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.320
Sure. Yeah. Cool. That... Friends.

227
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:23.739
Okay. See you later, friend.

228
00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:25.324
All right, pal.

229
00:14:28.744 --> 00:14:30.829
Wedgie! Smell you later!

230
00:14:55.479 --> 00:14:58.774
<i>Hey! Will you shut the fuck up
and let me sing?</i>

231
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:43.819
Hello?

232
00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:52.536
Hello?

233
00:16:02.838 --> 00:16:03.922
Hello?

234
00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:07.926
Hi, little guy.

235
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.052
Look at you.

236
00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:11.763
Little? I'm not little.
I'm hung like a bull, lady.

237
00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:15.058
Check it out.
You ever seen a bird dick this big?

238
00:16:15.184 --> 00:16:17.352
- Too much for you, huh, baby?
- Yeah.

239
00:16:17.436 --> 00:16:19.646
All right. Well, step off then, sweet cheeks.

240
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.370
Come back when you want some real loving.

241
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:23.984
Okay.

242
00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:26.195
Fucking tease.

243
00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:35.162
Hello?

244
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.383
I'm... I'm sorry, child.

245
00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:51.011
Did I frighten you, child?

246
00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:53.972
I'm sorry. Are you scared?

247
00:16:54.473 --> 00:16:56.433
All right. I'll sing to you.

248
00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:07.819
Better?

249
00:17:08.487 --> 00:17:10.989
I'm here with Professor Oldman's group.

250
00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:12.449
I'm Hanson.

251
00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.243
I'm the caretaker.

252
00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:15.494
- Hi.
- Hi.

253
00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.496
And what's your name, sweet child?

254
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.581
- I'm Cindy.
- Cindy.

255
00:17:20.499 --> 00:17:23.669
But the resemblance is striking.

256
00:17:23.919 --> 00:17:28.507
Look at the thin cheek bones
and the same lips.

257
00:17:28.674 --> 00:17:30.717
Same eyes.

258
00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:32.511
Look at your hair.

259
00:17:33.262 --> 00:17:34.263
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.181
You've got the same nose.

261
00:17:36.682 --> 00:17:40.185
Tickle, tickle.
Be-boop, be-boop on the nose.

262
00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:44.273
Shall I show you to your room?

263
00:17:44.523 --> 00:17:47.025
That's heavy. That's heavy!

264
00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:49.236
I better use my strong hand.

265
00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:52.114
- Clumsy.
- No, that's fine.

266
00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:55.075
- Look, you got the panties...
- No. I can take care of it.

267
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.077
Look at all what you got here.

268
00:18:00.706 --> 00:18:01.866
Can't forget your toothbrush.

269
00:18:02.124 --> 00:18:03.917
Gonna need that for later.

270
00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:06.253
Okay. Here we go. Follow me, child.

271
00:18:06.712 --> 00:18:08.046
- Oh, God.
- Watch my bottom.

272
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.131
Coming through.

273
00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.049
Come on. Right this way.

274
00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.592
Here we are.

275
00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:18.056
So, do you live here by yourself?

276
00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:20.034
Well, yes. We've tried to rent it out,

277
00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:22.811
but people don't seem
to want to stay very long.

278
00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:25.439
There's old mother Kane.

279
00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:28.150
And that's old master Kane.

280
00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:30.652
Who's that?

281
00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:33.238
That's Big Daddy Kane.

282
00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:35.407
He's cute.

283
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.533
Yeah.

284
00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.077
That was the master's favourite toy.

285
00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:41.830
I don't know what it's doing out here.

286
00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:46.251
I swear. Sometimes I think
these toys have a mind of their own.

287
00:18:56.762 --> 00:18:58.221
Right this way.

288
00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:02.642
No, no, no. Not that room, sweetheart. No.

289
00:19:02.893 --> 00:19:05.020
No. That was the master's mistress's room.

290
00:19:05.896 --> 00:19:09.107
Yeah, he kind of was a little bit of a horn ball.

291
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.069
No. You go and stay right over here.

292
00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:15.364
This was the room that belonged
to the love of his life.

293
00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:17.199
His wife, Caroline.

294
00:19:18.617 --> 00:19:20.202
I'll show it to you.

295
00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:22.579
Watch. My fanny's coming through.

296
00:19:22.662 --> 00:19:25.415
Watch it. Make room for fanny.

297
00:19:25.499 --> 00:19:26.750
Wow!

298
00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:28.794
It's beautiful.

299
00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:30.128
Well, thank you, child.

300
00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.047
You know, I have been working out.

301
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.007
I've been doing my bun busters every day.

302
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:36.802
I squeeze really tight, and then I let loose.

303
00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.137
I squeeze really tight

304
00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:41.431
and then let loose.

305
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.142
Okay.

306
00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:48.855
Yes.

307
00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.315
Look at this.

308
00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:52.317
Caroline looked beautiful in that dress.

309
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:55.195
In fact, she always looked her best.

310
00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:59.658
Do you know that she used to entertain
for royalty and common folk?

311
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.327
Even the president of the United States.

312
00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:13.338
Don't be frightened, child.
This is just Mr. Kitties.

313
00:20:13.463 --> 00:20:15.674
He was the master's favourite pet.

314
00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:18.051
He's been in the family for generations.

315
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.679
Look at him. He hasn't aged a day.

316
00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:24.766
All right, child, well,
I think I'll take my leave.

317
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.811
You let me know
if there's anything you need.

318
00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:31.440
Yes, and as you can see, Professor,
I've taken care of everything,

319
00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.942
including medical supplies
and blood storage.

320
00:20:34.025 --> 00:20:35.485
We want to be safe.

321
00:20:35.569 --> 00:20:38.071
Are these cameras
all throughout the house?

322
00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:40.282
Yes, sir. I thought that would be best.

323
00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:44.619
So, if one of our little chickadees
were to be taking a shower,

324
00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.705
which button would I press
to get a close-up?

325
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.331
That one.

326
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.708
- This one?
- That one.

327
00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:57.215
Excuse me, Professor,
but your guests have begun to arrive,

328
00:20:58.049 --> 00:21:00.469
and supper shall be served shortly.

329
00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:02.262
Okay. Thanks, handyman.

330
00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:04.473
I'm actually the caretaker.

331
00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.059
Aren't those cool new skates?

332
00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.728
Now, you be careful with those.

333
00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.480
Don't want to fall and break something.

334
00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:13.440
That's funny. That's real funny.

335
00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:15.275
Let me give you a hand.

336
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.404
Well, that's awful kind of you.

337
00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:21.698
How about you give me a standing ovation?

338
00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.116
Why don't you lift me up?

339
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.911
Okay. I see where
you're going with this one.

340
00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:28.371
You look familiar to me. Were you in Stomp?

341
00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:29.956
Hey, you can kiss my grits.

342
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.334
I think I'll be the bigger man now
and walk away.

343
00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.628
Walk away.

344
00:21:36.087 --> 00:21:37.273
I'll go and change for dinner.

345
00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:38.840
- Okay.
- I'll see you shortly.

346
00:21:38.924 --> 00:21:40.091
Sounds good.

347
00:21:40.258 --> 00:21:43.178
I'll just run upstairs
and jump into my jogging suit.

348
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.262
I'll be right down.

349
00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:47.599
Hey!

350
00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:50.560
Hey there, little guy. How you doing?

351
00:21:50.644 --> 00:21:51.770
Fuck off, four eyes.

352
00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:55.023
I beg your pardon?

353
00:21:55.106 --> 00:21:58.360
I said, "Fuck off, four eyes."

354
00:21:59.736 --> 00:22:01.571
I ought to kick your ass.

355
00:22:01.655 --> 00:22:03.281
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

356
00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:05.492
Relax, son. It's just a bird.

357
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.829
Hello, birdie. Polly want a cracker?

358
00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:12.123
Polly wants your mama's sweet ass.

359
00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:13.708
What did Polly say to me?

360
00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:17.629
I said, "Polly wants your mama's sweet ass."

361
00:22:17.963 --> 00:22:19.881
You don't be talking about my mama, son.

362
00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:21.383
You don't know my mama, son.

363
00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:23.635
Yeah, I know your mama.
I fucked her last night.

364
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.554
You want beef? I'll fuck you up!

365
00:22:25.637 --> 00:22:27.639
I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

366
00:22:27.806 --> 00:22:29.951
Now, fuck this.
I'm gonna handle this shit like a gentleman.

367
00:22:29.975 --> 00:22:31.017
Yo, hold my tooth, son.

368
00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:33.454
Yeah, come on, bitch.
You and that <i>Welcome Back, Kotter</i> haircut.

369
00:22:33.478 --> 00:22:35.039
Want a piece of me? Come on. Bring it on.

370
00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:36.290
What, you hard core? Give me some.

371
00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:39.192
- Bring it on, bitch.
- No, no, no. What?

372
00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:40.652
You gonna talk, son? Then do it.

373
00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:43.154
Come on, pussy. Let me out of here.
I'll fuck you up.

374
00:22:44.656 --> 00:22:45.657
Hi, guys.

375
00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:47.117
- Hey.
- Hey.

376
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:48.910
Hey, Buddy.

377
00:22:48.994 --> 00:22:50.074
- Hey, Cin.
- How you doing?

378
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:51.663
Open chest!

379
00:22:51.913 --> 00:22:55.000
Come on. You got to be
quicker than that, A cup.

380
00:22:58.295 --> 00:22:59.337
Hey, guys.

381
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:00.755
- Hey!
- How you doing?

382
00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:03.651
Well, are you boys just gonna sit there
with your mouths open,

383
00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:05.260
or is someone gonna offer me a seat?

384
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:12.892
I warmed it up for you.

385
00:23:12.976 --> 00:23:14.769
It's the best seat in the house.

386
00:23:14.853 --> 00:23:16.271
Second best.

387
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.859
Professor, is this the same house

388
00:23:20.942 --> 00:23:23.778
that a young girl was possessed
by a demon or something?

389
00:23:23.862 --> 00:23:26.823
Yes, it was reported
but never substantiated.

390
00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:34.956
All right. Well, who'd like some appetizers?

391
00:23:35.332 --> 00:23:36.332
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

392
00:23:36.374 --> 00:23:37.959
That's what I like to hear.

393
00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:40.295
Hey, these buns look good.

394
00:23:40.378 --> 00:23:41.504
Yeah.

395
00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:43.506
And they're so soft and warm.

396
00:23:43.632 --> 00:23:45.592
- Ray!
- I'm sorry. My bad.

397
00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:47.093
These are delicious.

398
00:23:47.177 --> 00:23:49.554
Thank you, my child. I made them by hand.

399
00:23:52.057 --> 00:23:53.600
Okay.

400
00:23:53.975 --> 00:23:57.771
Here we go.
I think the taters are just about done.

401
00:23:57.979 --> 00:24:01.274
I'm just gonna give them
one quick whisk here.

402
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.494
Okay, now. Dig in.

403
00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:16.581
All right. Now it's time for the turkey.

404
00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:18.708
What a beautiful bird.

405
00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:20.001
- No!
- No, man!

406
00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:21.127
Hey! Hey! Hey, man.

407
00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:24.130
Why don't you just relax
and just let me do that for you?

408
00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:26.383
- Yeah.
- Rest that little hand.

409
00:24:26.466 --> 00:24:30.220
It's my pleasure,
but what a nice young man to offer.

410
00:24:30.303 --> 00:24:31.783
Let me give you a little pinch there.

411
00:24:32.347 --> 00:24:34.182
- Come on.
- Fuck it!

412
00:24:36.267 --> 00:24:39.854
You know, a lot of people
are kind of intimidated

413
00:24:39.938 --> 00:24:41.690
about making a turkey,

414
00:24:41.773 --> 00:24:44.109
but really it's very simple.

415
00:24:44.192 --> 00:24:46.194
You just have to know
the anatomy of a turkey,

416
00:24:46.277 --> 00:24:49.406
and it's got, over here,
just the tiniest little stink hole,

417
00:24:49.948 --> 00:24:53.118
but it's big enough to get your hand
right up inside it.

418
00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:57.789
Stuff the shit out of it.

419
00:24:58.123 --> 00:24:59.708
I cook it with all the giblets,

420
00:24:59.791 --> 00:25:01.501
the penises and the ginies.

421
00:25:01.835 --> 00:25:04.629
And now, a lot of people
like to baste their turkeys,

422
00:25:04.713 --> 00:25:06.172
but I use this.

423
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:08.967
I lick like that.

424
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.844
And get into the little

425
00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:12.637
hiney hiney ho...

426
00:25:14.055 --> 00:25:15.223
That's nice and good.

427
00:25:15.306 --> 00:25:18.601
I don't know what the hell that is,
but I'll lick it anyway.

428
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:19.853
Up and down,

429
00:25:19.936 --> 00:25:21.896
and then I like to get that right on there.

430
00:25:24.983 --> 00:25:26.276
Hiawatha!

431
00:25:27.318 --> 00:25:28.403
And I got one of these.

432
00:25:28.486 --> 00:25:31.656
I'm gonna pull that off, and barn!
That just kicks it up a little bit.

433
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:35.076
All right. I think that's almost ready now.

434
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.520
And then we bring it to the table.

435
00:25:39.497 --> 00:25:40.665
Good.

436
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.168
All right. Who's ready for a wing?

437
00:25:43.501 --> 00:25:44.794
Yours or the turkey's?

438
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.007
I just thought that was funny.

439
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.050
Well, I know what you'd like.

440
00:25:51.134 --> 00:25:52.343
How about a leg?

441
00:25:54.971 --> 00:25:56.181
How about two?

442
00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:59.326
How about I take these two legs
and shove them right up your ass

443
00:25:59.392 --> 00:26:00.477
all the way to the knee!

444
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.187
Dwight. Dwight, relax.

445
00:26:02.979 --> 00:26:05.231
Hanson, may I ask you,

446
00:26:05.315 --> 00:26:09.694
is there something on the menu
that you haven't personally prepared?

447
00:26:11.154 --> 00:26:13.281
Well, I ordered out the dessert.

448
00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:15.116
- All right!
- All right!

449
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.535
Make room. Here comes the pie.

450
00:26:17.827 --> 00:26:20.038
All right. Okay.

451
00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:23.291
Who wants the first piece of that pie?

452
00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:26.002
I see you eyeing the first piece.

453
00:26:28.213 --> 00:26:29.798
That's good.

454
00:26:31.132 --> 00:26:32.972
- Pass that down to her, will you?
- Thank you.

455
00:26:33.051 --> 00:26:34.469
That's nice.

456
00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:36.805
My germs.

457
00:26:38.223 --> 00:26:39.224
My germs.

458
00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:41.267
My germs! Hey...

459
00:26:55.198 --> 00:26:58.243
Come play with me.

460
00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:02.330
Come play.

461
00:27:08.253 --> 00:27:09.420
Hello?

462
00:28:23.036 --> 00:28:26.456
Cindy. Cindy.

463
00:28:27.123 --> 00:28:28.458
Who is it?

464
00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:30.501
I want to help you, Cindy.

465
00:28:30.585 --> 00:28:31.920
Who are you?

466
00:28:32.003 --> 00:28:33.922
You're in danger, Cindy.

467
00:28:34.005 --> 00:28:35.590
I want to help you.

468
00:28:35.673 --> 00:28:38.259
Help me how? Who's in danger?

469
00:28:38.343 --> 00:28:41.304
Check the music room.
Check the music room.

470
00:28:41.387 --> 00:28:42.597
Where are you?

471
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.724
Check the fucking music room!

472
00:28:47.185 --> 00:28:48.853
Hey, Cindy, think fast!

473
00:28:52.565 --> 00:28:53.733
Dude, you suck!

474
00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:57.654
Buddy...

475
00:28:58.363 --> 00:28:59.614
About this friendship thing...

476
00:28:59.697 --> 00:29:02.450
Yeah, I think it is so cool
having a girl as a friend.

477
00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:05.203
That's just it, Buddy. I am a girl.

478
00:29:05.787 --> 00:29:07.455
You can't be so rough with me.

479
00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:09.504
Well, then what the hell
are we supposed to do?

480
00:29:10.208 --> 00:29:11.709
Gentle stuff.

481
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:17.006
You know, like talking and sharing secrets
and past experiences.

482
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.841
You know, stuff like that.

483
00:29:19.842 --> 00:29:21.719
That sounds kind of gay.

484
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.073
Well, I guess since you're a girl,
it's all right then, right?

485
00:29:24.097 --> 00:29:25.890
Yeah. It'll be fine.

486
00:29:26.057 --> 00:29:27.225
- All right.
- Hey, listen.

487
00:29:27.308 --> 00:29:29.102
Will you come check
something out with me?

488
00:29:29.185 --> 00:29:30.228
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay.

489
00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:32.438
- We can practice our talking.
- Yeah. Exactly.

490
00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:35.834
I want to tell you about this thing that
happened to me when I was in high school.

491
00:29:35.858 --> 00:29:36.985
Really? What happened?

492
00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:39.171
This hot Spanish Chick's
like licking my nuts, right...

493
00:29:39.195 --> 00:29:40.321
Buddy!

494
00:29:40.405 --> 00:29:41.948
No, no. This is the best part.

495
00:29:42.407 --> 00:29:44.033
Oh, my God. Look.

496
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:46.744
Dude! Someone's on the rag!

497
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.831
They lead straight to the bookcase.

498
00:30:03.094 --> 00:30:07.265
God! Must be a secret study or something.

499
00:30:18.192 --> 00:30:19.277
Wow.

500
00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:29.537
Oh, my God.

501
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.999
It says Hugh Kane and his mistress
were murdered in this house.

502
00:30:33.124 --> 00:30:34.667
Whoa. Check this out.

503
00:30:38.046 --> 00:30:41.549
- This must be his wife.
- Oh, my God. She looks just like you.

504
00:30:41.924 --> 00:30:43.259
You think?

505
00:30:43.551 --> 00:30:45.053
She's really beautiful.

506
00:30:45.178 --> 00:30:46.304
Yeah.

507
00:30:46.596 --> 00:30:49.515
Well, actually, her hair doesn't have
as many split ends as yours,

508
00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:51.684
and her skin isn't as oily as yours, either.

509
00:30:51.768 --> 00:30:53.568
Also, sometimes your eyes
get kind of squinty,

510
00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:56.004
and you look like you might
have Down syndrome or something.

511
00:30:56.147 --> 00:30:58.274
Other than that, though,
the resemblance is uncanny.

512
00:30:58.357 --> 00:30:59.567
- Really?
- Yeah.

513
00:31:00.151 --> 00:31:01.360
Also, her tits are perfect.

514
00:31:01.444 --> 00:31:03.130
They're not pointy
or funny-looking like yours,

515
00:31:03.154 --> 00:31:04.322
or spaced too far apart.

516
00:31:04.405 --> 00:31:06.324
Okay! Enough!

517
00:31:07.658 --> 00:31:08.743
God.

518
00:31:09.744 --> 00:31:11.704
Oh, my God, look at this.

519
00:31:14.332 --> 00:31:15.500
"Caroline."

520
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:17.835
Must have been hers.

521
00:31:20.254 --> 00:31:21.255
Oh, my God.

522
00:31:21.339 --> 00:31:23.650
All right. Let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.

523
00:31:23.674 --> 00:31:25.093
Okay. Grab the chest.

524
00:31:25.176 --> 00:31:26.511
Thanks.

525
00:31:26.636 --> 00:31:27.762
- Buddy!
- What?

526
00:31:27.845 --> 00:31:30.181
- I meant the chest.
- Right.

527
00:32:08.886 --> 00:32:10.429
What the...

528
00:32:19.522 --> 00:32:20.565
Hey.

529
00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:24.569
Nice.

530
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.043
Okay.

531
00:32:41.294 --> 00:32:42.378
Hello!

532
00:32:42.461 --> 00:32:44.380
If I had known, I would have freshened up!

533
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:45.899
I wish you would have freshened up, too.

534
00:32:45.923 --> 00:32:47.091
Get up there! Come on!

535
00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:49.135
- You want this?
- Yeah. Whose is it?

536
00:32:49.218 --> 00:32:51.262
That's it, Daddy. Take it like you want it.

537
00:32:51.345 --> 00:32:52.638
Give it to me!

538
00:32:52.763 --> 00:32:54.223
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Don't you...

539
00:32:54.307 --> 00:32:55.516
- Yeah!
- Run from me.

540
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.684
Come here!

541
00:32:56.767 --> 00:32:57.810
Bring it on!

542
00:32:57.894 --> 00:32:59.437
Kinky's my middle name, bitch!

543
00:32:59.729 --> 00:33:01.063
Yeah!

544
00:33:01.689 --> 00:33:04.275
That was the best that I've ever had.

545
00:33:04.859 --> 00:33:07.028
Mrs. Huey Kane.

546
00:33:07.195 --> 00:33:09.030
Doesn't that just have a ring to it?

547
00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:12.283
Baby?

548
00:33:12.658 --> 00:33:14.118
Where you going?

549
00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:16.120
Call me!

550
00:33:24.462 --> 00:33:25.630
Let's do something freaky.

551
00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:28.716
Like what, Ray?

552
00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:29.884
I don't know.

553
00:33:29.967 --> 00:33:33.137
I don't know.
Why don't you talk dirty to me?

554
00:33:33.971 --> 00:33:35.723
I don't know what to say, Ray.

555
00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:37.934
Come on. Just make something up.

556
00:33:39.852 --> 00:33:42.730
Ray, why do you make me so bad?

557
00:33:42.813 --> 00:33:45.149
Come on. Because you a bad girl.

558
00:33:45.816 --> 00:33:46.817
Okay.

559
00:33:49.362 --> 00:33:50.404
I'm gonna work this.

560
00:33:50.488 --> 00:33:51.614
Yeah. Work it.

561
00:33:52.156 --> 00:33:53.741
I'm gonna make this mine.

562
00:33:53.824 --> 00:33:55.910
It's all yours. Yeah.

563
00:33:55.993 --> 00:33:59.455
I'm gonna piss on your face,
and then I'm gonna fart in your mouth.

564
00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:02.124
Yeah! And then I'm gonna
shit on these walls, Ray!

565
00:34:02.208 --> 00:34:03.292
Hey, hey! Hey!

566
00:34:05.711 --> 00:34:06.754
Too dirty?

567
00:34:12.718 --> 00:34:13.761
Hello?

568
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:20.268
Hey, kitty, kitty.

569
00:34:20.685 --> 00:34:21.894
Hi, little fella.

570
00:34:33.864 --> 00:34:35.950
Okay. Okay.

571
00:34:36.367 --> 00:34:37.702
That's okay, cat.

572
00:34:40.329 --> 00:34:43.874
I think I know why you're mad, Mr. Cat.

573
00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:47.920
I didn't mean to go poopie in your litter box.

574
00:34:54.552 --> 00:34:57.722
Help! My pussy's gone crazy!

575
00:35:27.084 --> 00:35:29.337
Okay. You want a piece of me?

576
00:35:32.006 --> 00:35:34.175
Yeah! How do you like that, little pussy?

577
00:35:34.508 --> 00:35:35.760
Come on!

578
00:35:37.553 --> 00:35:39.221
Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

579
00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:44.435
Is that all you got?

580
00:35:44.769 --> 00:35:46.020
Come on!

581
00:35:46.103 --> 00:35:47.313
Give me your best shot!

582
00:36:03.704 --> 00:36:05.706
I'm telling you, Professor, it was possessed.

583
00:36:06.123 --> 00:36:09.627
- Theo, did you see this animal?
- No, I didn't.

584
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:12.463
I heard all the commotion,
but by the time I went in there,

585
00:36:12.546 --> 00:36:13.964
I guess it was gone.

586
00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:18.219
What? So, you think I did this to myself?

587
00:36:18.302 --> 00:36:22.807
No. All I'm saying is that cats are known
to be very territorial animals,

588
00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:27.353
and it's likely that it did attack,
but that doesn't mean it was possessed.

589
00:36:30.022 --> 00:36:33.150
Maybe you two should sleep together.

590
00:36:33.651 --> 00:36:35.361
What are you getting at, Professor?

591
00:36:35.736 --> 00:36:38.989
I'm just saying that if indeed
this cat did attack,

592
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.327
it's less likely to come back
if the two of you were, let's say,

593
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:45.663
together.

594
00:36:46.414 --> 00:36:48.416
Oh, come on, it's college.

595
00:36:48.499 --> 00:36:50.334
It's time for you two to experiment.

596
00:36:50.918 --> 00:36:53.129
I don't think we're gonna
be getting much help here.

597
00:36:53.212 --> 00:36:54.255
On the contrary, actually,

598
00:36:54.338 --> 00:36:56.215
I'd be more than happy
to walk you through it.

599
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.467
Come on, Cin.
I'll make sure you get tucked in.

600
00:36:58.551 --> 00:37:02.012
Good idea.
Don't forget to kiss each other good night.

601
00:37:03.514 --> 00:37:06.016
There's something going on
in this house, Professor.

602
00:37:06.183 --> 00:37:07.852
I'm not crazy!

603
00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:12.398
One, two,

604
00:37:12.857 --> 00:37:18.779
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

605
00:37:18.863 --> 00:37:20.364
nine, Brandon, 10,

606
00:37:20.698 --> 00:37:21.866
11, Brandon, come on!

607
00:37:21.949 --> 00:37:23.033
Count with me!

608
00:37:42.428 --> 00:37:43.679
Hey, you.

609
00:37:45.973 --> 00:37:47.475
Come here a minute.

610
00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:50.686
Come here.

611
00:37:56.442 --> 00:37:57.610
Peek-a-boo!

612
00:38:01.655 --> 00:38:02.990
- Come on, let's play!
- Stop it!

613
00:38:04.074 --> 00:38:06.076
This is a fun game.

614
00:38:07.661 --> 00:38:08.871
Hey, what are you doing?

615
00:38:08.954 --> 00:38:10.331
Uncle Ray-Ray's got a game.

616
00:38:10.414 --> 00:38:11.558
Hey, get your finger out of there.

617
00:38:11.582 --> 00:38:12.958
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...

618
00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:16.396
You want to play with Uncle Ray?

619
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.755
Peek-a-boo!

620
00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:22.218
Help!

621
00:38:23.636 --> 00:38:24.678
Oh, God!

622
00:38:24.762 --> 00:38:26.263
Here's a little balloon animal.

623
00:38:38.442 --> 00:38:41.153
<i>"I can't take living with him any longer.</i>

624
00:38:41.237 --> 00:38:43.239
<i>"He's becoming a monster.</i>

625
00:38:43.697 --> 00:38:46.116
<i>"I suspect he was having an affair.</i>

626
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.203
<i>"I believe he's sleeping
with our babysitter Victoria.</i>

627
00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:53.123
<i>"It must be why he keeps her around
because we have no children."</i>

628
00:38:53.249 --> 00:38:57.461
Cindy. I want you to know
what happened, Cindy.

629
00:39:07.429 --> 00:39:08.931
Hello, Cindy.

630
00:39:09.014 --> 00:39:10.307
Hello, Professor.

631
00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:20.985
I take it you're not mad at me anymore.

632
00:39:21.277 --> 00:39:23.529
I wouldn't go that far, Professor.

633
00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.324
- Why don't you just relax?
- Okay.

634
00:39:43.257 --> 00:39:45.676
I think she's starting to suspect something.

635
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.595
Who?

636
00:39:49.638 --> 00:39:50.889
Your wife.

637
00:39:55.769 --> 00:39:57.146
Oh, my God.

638
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.440
- It happened right here.
- What?

639
00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:00.733
She came home.

640
00:40:01.358 --> 00:40:02.651
<i>- She saw them!
- Saw who?</i>

641
00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.154
I was in my room reading her journal.

642
00:40:05.529 --> 00:40:08.115
Then I found this dress in the closet.

643
00:40:08.782 --> 00:40:10.659
That's all I remember.

644
00:40:11.493 --> 00:40:12.703
What about you, Ray?

645
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.206
I bought mine on Friday.
I just came down to get a banana.

646
00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:18.417
Shit is hot, right?

647
00:40:19.668 --> 00:40:21.712
Good night, little plant.

648
00:40:21.795 --> 00:40:24.048
You drink all this little water up

649
00:40:24.214 --> 00:40:27.343
so you can grow up to be
a nice strong chron plant.

650
00:40:27.426 --> 00:40:28.927
Yes. Yes.

651
00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:31.013
And then you'll be smoked by all the rappers

652
00:40:31.096 --> 00:40:34.850
and make them do a whole lot of dumb shit
that fuck up their careers.

653
00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:36.352
Yes, you will.

654
00:40:38.062 --> 00:40:39.730
Night-night, baby.

655
00:40:50.532 --> 00:40:52.868
I'm gonna rob that bitch tonight.

656
00:41:03.087 --> 00:41:05.506
<i>Lockdown Records presents</i>

657

No! It's me!

I got an idea!

679
00:42:07.234 --> 00:42:08.318
Wait a second!

680
00:42:08.402 --> 00:42:09.778
Hold on, Shorty!

Shit!

687
00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:29.548
- Shit!
- Put him out.

688
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:31.258
This shit burns more than a perm!

689
00:42:39.683 --> 00:42:42.644
There's a whole lot of freaky shit
going on in this house.

690
00:42:43.353 --> 00:42:45.564
There's more to this story
than the Professor told us.

691
00:42:46.607 --> 00:42:48.567
Last night, I found a secret room,

692
00:42:49.193 --> 00:42:51.987
and I found all these newspaper clippings
about Hugh Kane.

693
00:42:52.696 --> 00:42:54.698
He was a really evil man.

694
00:42:55.657 --> 00:42:57.743
And I found a picture of his wife.

695
00:42:59.203 --> 00:43:01.163
Oh, my God! She looks just like you.

696
00:43:01.246 --> 00:43:03.123
- You think?
- Yeah.

697
00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:07.211
She doesn't have as many split ends,
and her skin's not as oily as yours.

698
00:43:07.503 --> 00:43:08.879
Yeah. Yeah.

699
00:43:08.962 --> 00:43:10.940
Sometimes you do this little
squinty thing with your eyes.

700
00:43:10.964 --> 00:43:12.650
It looks like you got
Down syndrome or something.

701
00:43:12.674 --> 00:43:14.384
Yeah, y'all look just alike,

702
00:43:15.177 --> 00:43:17.304
except she got some perfect boobs,

703
00:43:17.387 --> 00:43:19.227
and yours look like them
old orangutan titties.

704
00:43:20.766 --> 00:43:21.975
Shit, son!

705
00:43:22.059 --> 00:43:24.228
Got to put you in
the full nelson to lick them.

706
00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:28.732
Okay! Enough!

707
00:43:30.901 --> 00:43:34.363
Anyway, I think she killed him,
and now he wants me.

708
00:43:34.446 --> 00:43:36.156
Yeah. Right, bitch.

709
00:43:52.756 --> 00:43:54.508
Morning, Dwight. Let me help you.

710
00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:57.219
I don't need your help. I can do it myself.

711
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:04.852
Okay. Professor, we need to talk.

712
00:44:05.352 --> 00:44:06.687
What is it, Dwight?

713
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.273
I think you should consider
cutting the experiment short.

714
00:44:09.356 --> 00:44:10.440
What?

715
00:44:10.524 --> 00:44:13.652
This poltergeist is growing
increasingly more violent.

716
00:44:13.735 --> 00:44:16.530
I think we're all in danger here,
and I've got to put my foot down

717
00:44:16.613 --> 00:44:20.033
and stand up for what I believe in
and say that we've got to pull the plug.

718
00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:22.744
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Dwight.

719
00:44:22.828 --> 00:44:24.496
I say when we pull the plug.

720
00:44:25.289 --> 00:44:27.040
We are on the verge of greatness,

721
00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:30.419
and I am this close to getting laid.

722
00:44:30.711 --> 00:44:33.672
Now, the bus arrives on Monday.
No one leaves till then.

723
00:44:34.047 --> 00:44:38.677
Here are the keys to the gate.
No one gets access to them.

724
00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:40.637
Yes, sir.

725
00:44:42.222 --> 00:44:45.017
Okay, guys,
I think the Professor's up to something.

726
00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.560
I heard Dwight tell the Professor

727
00:44:46.643 --> 00:44:48.288
that there could be a poltergeist
in the house

728
00:44:48.312 --> 00:44:49.855
and that we could all be in danger!

729
00:44:49.938 --> 00:44:52.149
No, son! Not a poltergeist!

730
00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:54.776
What's a poltergeist?

731
00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.070
- I'm getting out of here.
- No. We can't go anywhere.

732
00:44:57.154 --> 00:44:59.549
The gates are locked.
Dwight's the only one who has the keys.

733
00:44:59.573 --> 00:45:01.175
- Baby, get my Vaseline.
- I'm gonna have to handle...

734
00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:03.660
Get my Vaseline, a banana,
and some duct tape.

735
00:45:03.744 --> 00:45:06.424
- I'm gonna break his legs.
- I'm gonna fuck that little cripple up!

736
00:45:06.455 --> 00:45:09.499
Guys, just give me five minutes
alone with him, okay?

737
00:45:09.791 --> 00:45:11.126
I'll get the keys.

738
00:45:17.674 --> 00:45:18.675
Hello, Dwight.

739
00:45:21.178 --> 00:45:22.763
Hi, Theo. Hi.

740
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.892
What you working on?

741
00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:30.103
Just a little experiment.

742
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.523
Work, work, work.

743
00:45:34.149 --> 00:45:35.359
Is that all you ever do?

744
00:45:35.651 --> 00:45:38.654
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.

745
00:45:39.863 --> 00:45:43.325
You know, the Professor
might have everyone else fooled,

746
00:45:43.408 --> 00:45:48.121
but I know who the real brains
behind this operation is.

747
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.208
Yeah? You do?

748
00:45:52.709 --> 00:45:54.586
That's what turns me on about you.

749
00:45:55.087 --> 00:45:56.505
You're so smart.

750
00:45:57.506 --> 00:45:59.257
And those sexy eyes.

751
00:46:05.806 --> 00:46:07.516
Why don't I put some music on?

752
00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:09.434
- Yeah. Music.
- Yeah.

753
00:46:13.605 --> 00:46:15.565
You know, Dwight,

754
00:46:15.649 --> 00:46:18.610
I hear you're the only one
who has the keys to the gate.

755
00:46:23.031 --> 00:46:25.409
That's true. It is. I'm... Correct.

756
00:46:26.201 --> 00:46:27.411
What if

757
00:46:29.079 --> 00:46:30.956
I wanted to borrow those keys?

758
00:46:32.082 --> 00:46:35.627
Oh, dear sweet God in heaven.

759
00:46:37.212 --> 00:46:39.506
I... Yeah, I can't. I can't.

760
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:41.758
Come on. Yes, you can, baby.

761
00:46:41.842 --> 00:46:44.344
- No.
- Please? I mean, look.

762
00:46:44.428 --> 00:46:47.222
You help me by giving me the keys,

763
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.225
and I'll help by giving you...

764
00:46:50.308 --> 00:46:52.394
Hey, Hey! Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa!

765
00:46:52.811 --> 00:46:54.938
Hey, I don't need your help, okay, lady?

766
00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:57.649
I can do it myself.

767
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.949
Hey, look! I'm tossing my own salad!

768
00:47:20.672 --> 00:47:23.216
So, this is your secret room.

769
00:47:26.136 --> 00:47:29.931
Well, this just isn't gonna work now, is it?

770
00:47:32.851 --> 00:47:35.520
Professor.

771
00:47:37.522 --> 00:47:40.025
Come over here.

772
00:47:45.322 --> 00:47:48.742
This way, you big hunk.

773
00:47:52.287 --> 00:47:53.663
Have we met?

774
00:47:54.456 --> 00:47:55.791
Follow me.

775
00:47:56.875 --> 00:47:58.418
Are you playing a little game?

776
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.045
Where are you?

777
00:48:00.128 --> 00:48:01.713
Come here, baby.

778
00:48:09.096 --> 00:48:10.138
No!

779
00:48:14.684 --> 00:48:16.103
- Is everybody here?
- Yeah.

780
00:48:16.186 --> 00:48:17.646
All right. Let's go.

781
00:48:18.063 --> 00:48:19.731
Shit, son!

782
00:48:23.193 --> 00:48:26.154
He's not gonna let us out of here!
He's gonna kill us!

783
00:48:26.404 --> 00:48:28.698
Look. A rocket scientist.

784
00:48:28.907 --> 00:48:30.742
All right. Quick.
Everybody to the laboratory.

785
00:48:30.826 --> 00:48:33.370
Move! Come on! Hurry up!

786
00:48:33.912 --> 00:48:35.580
You all are fucked!

787
00:48:38.041 --> 00:48:39.543
Lock the door.

788
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:42.671
Okay. We have to destroy it.

789
00:48:42.754 --> 00:48:45.006
That's great. How are we gonna destroy
what we can't see?

790
00:48:45.215 --> 00:48:46.466
I got it!

791
00:48:46.883 --> 00:48:50.345
We'll shave off our pubic hairs
and wear the shampoo for two weeks!

792
00:48:51.429 --> 00:48:52.430
No. Listen. Listen.

793
00:48:52.722 --> 00:48:54.182
We're gonna use these guns.

794
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:57.310
They emit a bolt of concentrated energy,

795
00:48:57.394 --> 00:49:01.231
which can damage the ectoplasmic cells
and destroy the ghost.

796
00:49:01.439 --> 00:49:04.568
Now, there's no more ammunition.
Conserve it. Use it wisely.

797
00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:06.069
Shut up.

798
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.198
Hey! Hey! Hey!

799
00:49:10.365 --> 00:49:12.033
Conserve your ammunition.

800
00:49:13.118 --> 00:49:14.327
My bad.

801
00:49:14.411 --> 00:49:17.172
All right. Now, the only way
we're gonna be able to track these ghosts

802
00:49:17.414 --> 00:49:18.999
is if we're all wearing one of these.

803
00:49:19.749 --> 00:49:22.419
These are thermo goggles.
They work on the principle of body heat.

804
00:49:22.586 --> 00:49:26.381
They're so powerful, they can detect
where any bodily fluids have been,

805
00:49:26.464 --> 00:49:28.091
even if they've been wiped clean.

806
00:49:32.387 --> 00:49:33.471
What?

807
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:36.516
Are my glasses crooked?

808
00:49:37.767 --> 00:49:40.854
Okay. Now listen,
that ghost may be invisible,

809
00:49:40.937 --> 00:49:42.373
but we have the advantage of being armed

810
00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:45.150
with the most sophisticated
high-tech equipment known to man.

811
00:49:45.233 --> 00:49:46.586
How are we gonna stay
in touch with each other?

812
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:48.650
I mean, do we have some
walkie-talkies or something?

813
00:49:48.695 --> 00:49:50.363
No. We have these.

814
00:49:52.449 --> 00:49:53.867
Those is Dixie cups.

815
00:49:53.992 --> 00:49:58.830
Well, we kind of ran short of funds
after the guns and the goggles.

816
00:50:00.457 --> 00:50:02.500
All right. Now, let's split up...

817
00:50:04.461 --> 00:50:06.046
Now, wait a minute! Hold up!

818
00:50:06.129 --> 00:50:08.006
How come every time
some scary shit happens

819
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:09.341
and we need to stick together,

820
00:50:09.424 --> 00:50:11.718
you white people always
say, "Let's split up"?

821
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:13.446
- Yeah.
- She's right. We should stick together.

822
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.888
Yes! That's what I'm saying!

823
00:50:14.971 --> 00:50:16.139
She's right.

824
00:50:16.223 --> 00:50:18.600
Okay. You three, follow me.

825
00:50:25.649 --> 00:50:27.359
Ain't that a bitch?

826
00:50:31.363 --> 00:50:33.406
We're gonna die, y'all.

827
00:50:43.416 --> 00:50:45.085
- Did you hear that?
- Hell, yeah.

828
00:50:46.836 --> 00:50:48.338
Where's Shorty?

829
00:50:48.755 --> 00:50:50.215
I don't know.

830
00:50:50.632 --> 00:50:51.675
Shorty!

831
00:50:51.758 --> 00:50:54.636
- Shorty!
- Shorty!

832
00:50:57.639 --> 00:50:58.765
Damn.

833
00:50:59.891 --> 00:51:02.602
All right. You wait right here.
I'll be right back.

834
00:51:02.686 --> 00:51:04.187
- Okay.
- All right.

835
00:51:13.655 --> 00:51:15.448
- Wow.
- What is this?

836
00:51:15.657 --> 00:51:17.117
I don't know.

837
00:51:18.952 --> 00:51:21.079
Looks like the furnace room.

838
00:51:21.204 --> 00:51:22.831
- All right. Let's go.
- No, wait.

839
00:51:23.081 --> 00:51:24.249
In that newspaper article,

840
00:51:24.332 --> 00:51:26.626
it said that Hugh Kane
was killed in the furnace.

841
00:51:32.048 --> 00:51:34.884
Wow. Look at this.

842
00:51:35.802 --> 00:51:37.721
There's so many ashes, Buddy.

843
00:51:41.558 --> 00:51:42.767
What are you doing?

844
00:51:42.934 --> 00:51:44.185
Hold it.

845
00:51:52.068 --> 00:51:53.587
Let's split up. I'll meet you on the other end.

846
00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:55.238
- Okay.
- Wait.

847
00:51:56.156 --> 00:51:57.490
Good luck.

848
00:51:58.408 --> 00:51:59.743
I love you!

849
00:52:09.377 --> 00:52:10.754
- Shorty!
- Cindy!

850
00:52:10.879 --> 00:52:14.215
There's a monster chasing me.
What are we gonna do?

851
00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:15.508
I got it!

852
00:52:15.592 --> 00:52:16.676
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

853
00:52:21.097 --> 00:52:22.390
Shorty!

854
00:52:23.016 --> 00:52:24.267
Shorty!

855
00:52:30.774 --> 00:52:34.277
Damn. Why does that little bitch
got to bring that shit over here?

856
00:52:34.736 --> 00:52:36.988
Okay. Well, maybe she won't see me.

857
00:52:37.238 --> 00:52:38.740
Somebody help me!

858
00:52:38.907 --> 00:52:40.116
Brenda!

859
00:52:42.702 --> 00:52:45.705
Shit, she saw me. Okay. Okay.

860
00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:51.461
Thank you, Lord!

861
00:52:54.089 --> 00:52:57.884
Okay. Now let that shit
just mutilate her white ass and leave.

862
00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:04.516
Damn, bitch, please die!

863
00:53:05.016 --> 00:53:06.309
Oh, my God, Brenda!

864
00:53:06.643 --> 00:53:07.894
We're gonna die!

865
00:53:07.977 --> 00:53:11.606
It would have just been you
if you had just shut the fuck up!

866
00:53:12.232 --> 00:53:13.233
It's coming!

867
00:53:13.316 --> 00:53:14.734
What is it?

868
00:53:14.818 --> 00:53:17.445
Is it a monster? Is it a monster?

869
00:53:21.449 --> 00:53:22.617
Cindy?

870
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:26.329
This is a skeleton. This is bones.

871
00:53:26.496 --> 00:53:28.456
Would you run from Calista Flockhart?

872
00:53:31.626 --> 00:53:32.752
Shut your ass up.

873
00:53:36.798 --> 00:53:38.299
Look. He crazy now.

874
00:53:39.175 --> 00:53:41.553
I'm sorry, Mr. Skeleton. Here.

875
00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:44.097
Gotcha! Psych!

876
00:53:44.848 --> 00:53:46.015
Have a nice trip.

877
00:53:50.395 --> 00:53:52.439
Hey, girl, I got an idea. Come on.

878
00:53:54.524 --> 00:53:56.192
Very funny.

879
00:54:02.365 --> 00:54:03.450
Now, get on out of here!

880
00:54:03.658 --> 00:54:06.244
Somebody gonna catch
an ass-whooping when I come back.

881
00:54:06.536 --> 00:54:09.038
Brenda, you are so brave.

882
00:54:09.122 --> 00:54:11.708
You know, you really are
my best friend, Cindy.

883
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:12.959
You guys okay?

884
00:54:13.042 --> 00:54:14.042
- Yeah.
- Please.

885
00:54:14.085 --> 00:54:16.754
It takes more than a little
bag of bones to scare me.

886
00:54:16.838 --> 00:54:18.047
Wedgie!

887
00:54:19.716 --> 00:54:20.967
The ghost has Buddy!

888
00:54:21.342 --> 00:54:22.342
My ass!

889
00:54:22.385 --> 00:54:24.554
- Brenda, do something!
- Okay!

890
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.309
I thought I was your best friend.

891
00:54:29.434 --> 00:54:30.518
Was.

892
00:54:30.727 --> 00:54:32.353
I'm gonna miss you, girl!

893
00:54:33.605 --> 00:54:35.148
Get my gun!

894
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.330
Are you okay?

895
00:54:50.955 --> 00:54:52.790
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

896
00:54:52.874 --> 00:54:55.168
Come on.
I think there's a first aid kit in the lab.

897
00:54:55.251 --> 00:54:56.586
Come on.

898
00:55:13.436 --> 00:55:15.563
Huey. Baby?

899
00:55:17.232 --> 00:55:18.733
Where are you?

900
00:55:22.654 --> 00:55:25.114
My love? Are you there?

901
00:55:28.034 --> 00:55:29.702
- Huey?
- Oh, no.

902
00:55:29.786 --> 00:55:32.580
Baby! Baby, I got to talk to you.

903
00:55:32.664 --> 00:55:34.791
- No. Go away!
- Baby?

904
00:55:36.376 --> 00:55:38.670
- Get away from me!
- Come on, baby.

905
00:55:38.753 --> 00:55:40.129
We can work this out.

906
00:55:42.632 --> 00:55:46.302
I mean, if we just stick together,
no one can hurt us, my love.

907
00:55:46.761 --> 00:55:48.721
It was just a booty call!

908
00:55:54.602 --> 00:55:56.020
Why won't you talk to me?

909
00:55:56.104 --> 00:55:58.439
Because you gave me crabs.

910
00:56:03.778 --> 00:56:06.322
You are the weakest link. Goodbye!

911
00:56:14.372 --> 00:56:16.416
Hey. How you doing?

912
00:56:29.137 --> 00:56:30.847
No, no. No kissing. No kissing.

913
00:56:33.516 --> 00:56:36.436
No. Leave this on. Leave this on.
You look beautiful just like that.

914
00:56:36.519 --> 00:56:37.604
Yeah. Yeah.

915
00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.858
Shit!

916
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:46.946
No, no, no.

917
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:48.698
Don't fuck it up.

918
00:56:49.324 --> 00:56:51.684
Cindy, I've been thinking about
this whole friendship thing.

919
00:56:51.993 --> 00:56:54.495
I've never had a friend
who cared for me the way you do.

920
00:56:55.246 --> 00:56:57.665
I mean, there's Ray,
but he cares for me in a different way,

921
00:56:57.749 --> 00:57:01.419
you know, like bringing me flowers
and running my bath water.

922
00:57:01.502 --> 00:57:03.772
And there's nights when I wake up
screaming and I look over,

923
00:57:03.796 --> 00:57:05.840
and Ray's in my bed holding me.

924
00:57:08.509 --> 00:57:13.222
Anyway, seeing as how tonight may be
our last night together, I was thinking...

925
00:57:13.306 --> 00:57:16.142
That we should take our friendship
a little bit further.

926
00:57:16.225 --> 00:57:17.226
- Yes.
- Buddy,

927
00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:19.228
I was thinking the exact same thing.

928
00:57:19.312 --> 00:57:21.731
I mean, this might be our last night alive,

929
00:57:23.107 --> 00:57:24.984
and I want to take full advantage of it.

930
00:57:25.068 --> 00:57:26.569
I was thinking the same thing!

931
00:57:27.195 --> 00:57:30.323
I want to be able to act out
our innermost fantasies.

932
00:57:30.406 --> 00:57:31.741
Great.

933
00:57:32.408 --> 00:57:36.621
Like, I've always wanted
to walk on the moon.

934
00:57:45.797 --> 00:57:48.257
Buddy!

935
00:57:50.635 --> 00:57:52.762
What about you, Buddy?
What do you want to do?

936
00:57:53.763 --> 00:57:54.931
Well...

937
00:57:57.892 --> 00:57:58.976
He's in here.

938
00:58:16.994 --> 00:58:18.413
Oh, my God. He locked us in.

939
00:58:18.496 --> 00:58:19.539
You should call for help.

940
00:58:21.457 --> 00:58:23.543
Hello! Hello. Can you hear me?

941
00:58:24.836 --> 00:58:26.462
Come in! Come in!

942
00:58:26.671 --> 00:58:28.381
Copy! Do you copy me?

943
00:58:29.298 --> 00:58:32.927
We have a situation here! Breaker!

944
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:36.639
Oh, my God. They can't hear me!

945
00:58:37.014 --> 00:58:39.016
Must be these walls or something.

946
00:58:44.522 --> 00:58:45.648
Okay.

947
00:58:46.858 --> 00:58:50.111
All right. You stay down here.
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

948
00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:51.821
Okay.

949
00:59:01.497 --> 00:59:02.498
Do you need help or...

950
00:59:02.582 --> 00:59:04.041
- No!
- Okay.

951
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.043
What do I look like to you?

952
00:59:06.753 --> 00:59:07.879
Just trying to be nice.

953
00:59:08.129 --> 00:59:09.964
- Cover me!
- What do you want me to do?

954
00:59:10.047 --> 00:59:11.340
Cover me!

955
00:59:11.716 --> 00:59:14.135
Not literally. I'm serpentining!

956
00:59:15.845 --> 00:59:18.473
They taught me that. Merchant Marines.

957
00:59:18.556 --> 00:59:20.183
Two years.

958
00:59:20.266 --> 00:59:22.435
Spent two years on my belly in Da Nang.

959
00:59:22.894 --> 00:59:24.395
- Yeah.
- Look!

960
00:59:24.687 --> 00:59:26.814
Look. Look what the cripple's doing.

961
00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.025
Shit.

962
00:59:31.194 --> 00:59:33.464
Look. I know you're proud, okay?
Well, just let me help you up...

963
00:59:33.488 --> 00:59:35.406
Step it back, candy pants!

964
00:59:35.948 --> 00:59:37.074
Fine.

965
00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:42.205
What are we gonna do?

966
00:59:42.747 --> 00:59:43.790
I'm cold.

967
00:59:44.749 --> 00:59:46.542
I can't feel my body, I'm so cold.

968
00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:48.377
Buddy, can you feel this?

969
00:59:48.586 --> 00:59:50.922
No. Try a little higher.

970
00:59:51.881 --> 00:59:53.508
What about that?

971
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.760
Keep rubbing.

972
01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:02.767
- Buddy, I don't think I'm ready...
- Cindy, please!

973
01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:05.728
It's a matter of life and death.

974
01:00:05.812 --> 01:00:09.357
I'm asking you in the name of love.

975
01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:15.071
Okay, Buddy.

976
01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.906
In the name of love.

977
01:00:25.915 --> 01:00:30.002
Cindy, I don't know
how much longer I can hold on.

978
01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:31.838
Don't you say your good-byes.

979
01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:35.424
You're gonna get out of here,
and you're gonna go on,

980
01:00:35.508 --> 01:00:37.802
- and you're gonna have lots of little babies.
- Yeah.

981
01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:40.596
- And you're gonna die an old man...
- Old man.

982
01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.306
- Warm in his bed.
- Warm in his bed.

983
01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:43.933
- Not here!
- No.

984
01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:45.768
- Not like this!
- Amen.

985
01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:48.396
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

986
01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:52.024
Coming to this house was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

987
01:00:52.108 --> 01:00:53.276
Me, too.

988
01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:56.445
And for that I am so thankful.

989
01:00:56.571 --> 01:00:58.114
- Don't let go.
- Never!

990
01:00:58.197 --> 01:00:59.323
I'll never let go!

991
01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:01.200
- I feel weak.
- Buddy!

992
01:01:01.284 --> 01:01:02.618
- I'm com...
- Come back!

993
01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:10.001
All right, Dwight Hartman,
it's your time to shine.

994
01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:13.254
All right. Come on.

995
01:01:19.844 --> 01:01:22.763
Come on, Kane. Show yourself!

996
01:01:22.972 --> 01:01:25.141
Look. I don't even need my thermal goggles.

997
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.253
That's right, mother...

998
01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:06.223
Hey, Kane, you hungry?
How about a little snack of this?

999
01:02:11.604 --> 01:02:12.605
No.

1000
01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:22.114
Gotcha!

1001
01:02:35.044 --> 01:02:39.715
I know what you're thinking.
Did I fire three shots or 117?

1002
01:02:40.466 --> 01:02:44.595
Well, do you feel lucky, punk?

1003
01:02:45.221 --> 01:02:47.390
Do you feel lucky?

1004
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:49.392
Do you feel lucky, punk?

1005
01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:50.768
Shoot me, motherfucker!

1006
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:59.485
Okay. Fine.

1007
01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:01.737
Make your best move, ass-bite.

1008
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.364
Help!

1009
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.617
Help!

1010
01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:51.245
Here. Take my hand.

1011
01:03:51.954 --> 01:03:53.164
Come on.

1012
01:03:53.414 --> 01:03:56.000
You're gonna fall unless you take my hand.

1013
01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:57.418
No. Give me your other hand.

1014
01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:00.296
No. My other hand isn't strong enough.

1015
01:04:00.629 --> 01:04:01.881
You take my little hand.

1016
01:04:01.964 --> 01:04:03.424
No! Get it away from me!

1017
01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:04.550
Take it!

1018
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.469
Take my hand!

1019
01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:18.856
No. No. Why me?

1020
01:04:18.939 --> 01:04:21.692
No. Come on. No. I've served you well.

1021
01:04:21.776 --> 01:04:24.653
Don't you do this to me.
No, please. Please, no.

1022
01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:31.410
Okay, Buddy.
It's time for us to get out of here.

1023
01:05:05.027 --> 01:05:07.071
Roger. Roger. Come in, Roger.

1024
01:05:07.196 --> 01:05:08.364
Ray, this is Cindy.

1025
01:05:08.447 --> 01:05:10.607
I don't want to talk to Cindy.
I want to talk to Roger.

1026
01:05:10.658 --> 01:05:12.618
Roger, where you at, man?
Quit fucking around.

1027
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:16.205
Ray, listen. The ghost is close.
He almost got us. Buddy's hurt.

1028
01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:17.540
What's your location?

1029
01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:18.707
I'm right behind you.

1030
01:05:18.791 --> 01:05:20.751
Ray, thank God. Okay. Where's Shorty?

1031
01:05:20.835 --> 01:05:24.130
I don't... I don't know.
He was here just a minute ago.

1032
01:05:24.463 --> 01:05:26.549
Okay. Listen. You go help Buddy in the lab.

1033
01:05:26.632 --> 01:05:28.312
- I'm gonna go check upstairs.
- All right.

1034
01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:32.972
That smells good.

1035
01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:34.640
Hello, Cindy.

1036
01:05:35.224 --> 01:05:37.893
Say hello to Cindy, Shorty.

1037
01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:41.230
Hello, Cindy.

1038
01:05:41.397 --> 01:05:42.773
Shorty, are you okay?

1039
01:05:43.232 --> 01:05:44.567
Talk to me!

1040
01:05:45.568 --> 01:05:46.861
Morphine?

1041
01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:49.446
Chloroform? Horse tranquillizers?
You drugged him!

1042
01:05:49.572 --> 01:05:51.907
I did not. That's all his stuff.

1043
01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:55.077
All right, Shorty.

1044
01:05:55.202 --> 01:05:56.482
Who's ready for the main course?

1045
01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:58.080
Me! Me.

1046
01:05:58.581 --> 01:05:59.957
Hanson, please.

1047
01:06:00.332 --> 01:06:01.542
No.

1048
01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:05.212
What the fuck?

1049
01:06:05.296 --> 01:06:06.755
Beetlejuice in the house.

1050
01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:08.424
This is your brains on drugs.

1051
01:06:12.094 --> 01:06:13.596
Shit, son.

1052
01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:24.231
- Shorty!
- Fucker got me.

1053
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.275
Cindy, What's going on?

1054
01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:28.110
It's Hanson. He's possessed.

1055
01:06:28.569 --> 01:06:29.570
Let's get him.

1056
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.230
- Angel style!
- Angel style!

1057
01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:38.305
Okay.

1058
01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:42.559
Come on.

1059
01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:00.494
Okay.

1060
01:08:05.207 --> 01:08:06.458
No!

1061
01:09:14.443 --> 01:09:15.444
Shit!

1062
01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:24.787
You okay, Dwight?

1063
01:09:25.287 --> 01:09:27.790
I... I can't feel my legs.

1064
01:09:31.418 --> 01:09:32.961
I can't feel my legs!

1065
01:09:33.128 --> 01:09:34.213
You never could.

1066
01:09:34.296 --> 01:09:35.631
You stay out of this, all right?

1067
01:09:36.298 --> 01:09:37.341
Now listen.

1068
01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:39.385
You get the others and meet us upstairs.

1069
01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:40.594
- All right?
- Okay.

1070
01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:42.846
You stay here. Ray-Ray, I need your help.

1071
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.098
Give me your belt.

1072
01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:49.144
The Crane.

1073
01:09:53.816 --> 01:09:55.025
The Crouching Tiger.

1074
01:10:00.656 --> 01:10:01.990
The Drunken Monkey.

1075
01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:07.371
The Mad Cow.

1076
01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:11.792
Motherfucker!

1077
01:10:14.962 --> 01:10:16.171
The Camel Toe.

1078
01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:41.238
Get the hell out of there, guys!

1079
01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:42.865
Come on!

1080
01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:49.538
Ray, give me 180.

1081
01:10:50.706 --> 01:10:51.790
Okay. Listen.

1082
01:10:51.874 --> 01:10:53.876
Someone has to go and lure him
onto that platform.

1083
01:10:59.214 --> 01:11:01.341
All right. I'll go.

1084
01:11:01.884 --> 01:11:03.677
- Cindy, let me...
- No, Buddy!

1085
01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:05.554
I'm the one he wants.

1086
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:09.016
Actually, I was saying
let me have your computer if you die.

1087
01:11:11.393 --> 01:11:14.021
Okay. But as soon as he gets there,
you have to get off.

1088
01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:15.481
Okay.

1089
01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:16.940
All right, 180 me.

1090
01:11:19.151 --> 01:11:22.654
Hugh Kane, it's me you want! Come get me!

1091
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:24.865
I'm not afraid anymore!

1092
01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.575
Show yourself!

1093
01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:49.574
Dwight, he's here. Do something.

1094
01:11:49.598 --> 01:11:51.099
I can't. She's still on the platform.

1095
01:11:51.183 --> 01:11:52.684
If I throw the switch, she'll die.

1096
01:11:52.768 --> 01:11:54.688
Cindy, get out of there!
You're gonna get killed!

1097
01:11:56.939 --> 01:11:58.065
Move out of the way!

1098
01:11:58.273 --> 01:11:59.274
I'll get her!

1099
01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:03.529
Why is he running so slow?

1100
01:12:03.654 --> 01:12:05.531
Ray! Run faster!

1101
01:12:05.739 --> 01:12:06.782
Okay!

1102
01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:08.700
Throw the switch!

1103
01:12:09.284 --> 01:12:11.745
Now you will be mine. Forever!

1104
01:12:23.674 --> 01:12:25.342
Ray, you saved me.

1105
01:12:26.301 --> 01:12:27.553
Are you okay?

1106
01:12:27.636 --> 01:12:29.888
I'm fine. I broke my fall.

1107
01:12:47.948 --> 01:12:49.908
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1108
01:12:52.202 --> 01:12:53.620
- Hey, y'all.
- We made it!

1109
01:12:53.704 --> 01:12:54.705
What's going on?

1110
01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:56.832
Shorty, you made it. You're alive!

1111
01:12:57.332 --> 01:13:00.419
Yeah. We made it!

1112
01:13:03.505 --> 01:13:05.924
{\an8}Yeah. It was traumatic. It really was.

1113
01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:09.011
And it's taking me a while to get over it,

1114
01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:11.638
but, you know,
now that we're out of the house

1115
01:13:11.722 --> 01:13:13.599
and back in school,

1116
01:13:14.016 --> 01:13:15.851
I just know that everything's gonna be okay.

1117
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:19.187
Oh, God, will you shut the fuck up?

1118
01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:22.065
Why couldn't you have just
left me there to die?

1119
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:24.318
Give me a fucking rope. I'll hang myself.

1120
01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:26.361
Here I go. I'm hanging myself.

1121
01:13:29.573 --> 01:13:32.576
Hello? Hi, Dad.

1122
01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:35.120
Are you having fun on your vacation?

1123
01:13:35.871 --> 01:13:38.790
No. Birds are very clean animals.
He's no trouble at all.

1124
01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:42.044
God damn it!
What the fuck did you put in this birdseed?

1125
01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:49.676
Dad, Buddy's here. I got to go.

1126
01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.844
Okay. I love you. Bye.

1127
01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:52.429
God, that was a big one.

1128
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:55.015
- Hey, Buddy!
- Surprise.

1129
01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:56.767
Open chest!

1130
01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.395
You got to be quicker than that, pencil dick.

1131
01:14:00.812 --> 01:14:02.064
Come on.

1132
01:14:04.191 --> 01:14:06.068
Hey, look out. A bee.

1133
01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:09.738
Buddy, I've never had anyone
be so protective of me before.

1134
01:14:09.821 --> 01:14:12.074
That's what your man's supposed to do.

1135
01:14:12.407 --> 01:14:13.909
Two hot dogs.

1136
01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:19.414
Buddy, get him!

1137
01:14:20.207 --> 01:14:21.375
Buddy?

1138
01:14:21.667 --> 01:14:23.502
- Buddy?
- I've come back for you.

1139
01:14:23.752 --> 01:14:25.545
No! This can't be happening!

1140
01:14:26.672 --> 01:14:28.173
It is happening.

1141
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:30.759
Now we're gonna be together forever.

1142
01:14:31.927 --> 01:14:33.011
No!

1143
01:14:33.595 --> 01:14:35.847
Yes!

1144
01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:43.355
Did you hear something?

1145
01:14:43.438 --> 01:14:45.273
No. I didn't hear nothing.
