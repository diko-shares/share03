WEBVTT

1
00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:11.382
Today, we sail to conquer the new world...

2
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:16.721
for Spain, for glory, for gold!

3
00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:20.725
<i>Viva</i> Cortes!

4
00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.147
Altivo, eyes forward.

5
00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:32.570
Seven!
All right!

6
00:02:32.654 --> 00:02:33.404
Yes!

7
00:02:33.488 --> 00:02:35.240
Partner!

8
00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:37.408
<i>Tons of gold for you</i> Hey!

9
00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:38.910
<i>Tons of gold for me</i> Hey!

10
00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:40.829
<i>Tons of gold for we</i> Hey!

11
00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:43.081
One more roll!

12
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.876
Uh, guys, you're broke!

13
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.545
You got nothin' to bet with!

14
00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:50.922
Oh, yeah? I got this!

15
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:51.673
A map!

16
00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:53.424
- A map?
- A map!

17
00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:56.845
A map of the wonders of the new world.

18
00:02:57.595 --> 00:02:58.972
Wow!

19
00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:00.056
Let's have a look.

20
00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:05.395
Tulio!

21
00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:07.939
Excuse us for one moment, please.

22
00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:09.524
Tulio, look!

23
00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:12.193
El Dorado, the city of gold.

24
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.196
This could be our destiny, our fate.

25
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.823
Miguel, if I believed in fate,

26
00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:18.908
I wouldn't be playing with loaded dice.

27
00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:21.202
Not with the face.

28
00:03:21.536 --> 00:03:22.536
No, no, no.

29
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.290
No! No! No!

30
00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:27.250
I said one more roll!

31
00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.044
My map against your cash.

32
00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:32.672
Hmm?

33
00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:34.799
All right, peewee. You're on!

34
00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:36.384
Not with those!

35
00:03:36.634 --> 00:03:38.094
This time we use my dice.

36
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:39.177
Uh...

37
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.680
Got a problem with that?

38
00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:42.556
No.

39
00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:45.059
I'm going to kill you.

40
00:03:49.188 --> 00:03:52.859
Come on, baby. Papa needs that crappy map.

41
00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:00.241
Stop that!

42
00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:05.079
Show me seven!

43
00:04:14.964 --> 00:04:15.757
Seven!

44
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.175
All right!

45
00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:18.051
Seven!

46
00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:19.135
Yes!

47
00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:21.012
There it is!

48
00:04:21.095 --> 00:04:22.847
Well, nice doing business with you.

49
00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.602
Oh!

50
00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:29.312
I knew it!

51
00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.690
Your dice are loaded!

52
00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:37.946
What? You gave me loaded dice?

53
00:04:41.783 --> 00:04:45.161
He gave me loaded dice!

54
00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:46.663
Guard, arrest him!

55
00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:50.333
You dare to impugn my honor?

56
00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:52.251
He was the one who was cheating!

57
00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:53.419
Arrest him!

58
00:04:53.503 --> 00:04:55.380
He tricked these sailors
and took their money!

59
00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:57.757
Oh, now I'm the thief?
Yes.

60
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.676
Take a look in the mirror, pal!

61
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.553
Oh, you better give them
that money back, or I'll...

62
00:05:02.637 --> 00:05:03.388
En garde!

63
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:04.806
En garde, yourself.

64
00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.850
I will give you the honor
of a quick and painless death.

65
00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:12.105
But not with that. Ha!
I prefer to fight fairly. Aha!

66
00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:15.525
Well, any last words?

67
00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:18.069
I will cut you to ribbons, fool!

68
00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:19.821
Such mediocrity.

69
00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:22.073
Let your sword do the talking.

70
00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:25.284
I will. It will be loquacious to a fault!

71
00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:26.828
Ha! Take that!

72
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.251
You mincing, fencing twit.

73
00:05:33.334 --> 00:05:35.294
Ah, you fight like my sister.

74
00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:37.922
I've fought your sister.
That's a compliment.

75
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:39.590
Blaggard!
Heathen!

76
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:42.802
Not the face. Not the face.

77
00:05:47.473 --> 00:05:50.018
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've decided it's a draw.

78
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:53.104
Thank you all for coming.
You've been great. See you soon.

79
00:05:53.354 --> 00:05:54.480
<i>Adiós!</i>

80
00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:59.652
Congratulations. You're very good.
No. That was good.

81
00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:01.029
Very...

82
00:06:04.532 --> 00:06:06.576
We should have kept our swords, I think.

83
00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:07.326
Y... Yeah.

84
00:06:07.368 --> 00:06:09.412
Yeah, I've got a plan.

85
00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:12.915
What is it?
Uh, well... Uh, you...

86
00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:16.377
pet him, and... I'll...
Yeah.

87
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:19.047
Run!

88
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.300
Uh, well, thanks a lot!

89
00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:27.388
Whoa!

90
00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:32.226
There they are!

91
00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:44.072
Bye. Thank you!

92
00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:02.423
I'll bet we can make that.

93
00:07:02.507 --> 00:07:03.424
There they are!

94
00:07:03.508 --> 00:07:05.259
Two <i>pesetas</i> says we can't.

95
00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:07.220
You're on!

96
00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:12.517
You lose!

97
00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.522
Oh!
Whoa! What's happening here?

98
00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:20.858
We're both in barrels.
That's the extent of my knowledge.

99
00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:32.954
Okay, Miguel, we gotta move fast.

100
00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:35.081
On three, we jump
out and head for the dock.

101
00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:36.749
Good. Good. Excellent.

102
00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.960
One, two, three...

103
00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:42.505
Th... Three!

104
00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:45.716
Three! Oh!

105
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.136
Three!

106
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:58.563
Uh, you ready? Ah, okay.
One more. Let's go.

107
00:07:59.147 --> 00:08:02.859
One, two, three!

108
00:08:07.572 --> 00:08:09.532
Excuse us.
Okay. We're outta here.

109
00:08:09.657 --> 00:08:11.909
Who ordered the, uh, pickles?

110
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:19.959
Cortes!

111
00:08:20.334 --> 00:08:25.214
My crew was as carefully chosen
as the disciples of Christ.

112
00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:28.593
And I will not tolerate stowaways.

113
00:08:30.178 --> 00:08:31.387
You will be flogged.

114
00:08:32.221 --> 00:08:34.390
And when we put into Cuba to resupply,

115
00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:37.310
God willing, you will be flogged
some more,

116
00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:42.356
and then enslaved on the sugar plantations
for the rest of your miserable lives.

117
00:08:43.608 --> 00:08:45.026
To the brig.

118
00:08:46.152 --> 00:08:47.862
All right! Cuba!

119
00:08:47.987 --> 00:08:49.530
Ah!

120
00:09:01.626 --> 00:09:04.253
Hey, Altivo! Ah-ta-ta, not for you!

121
00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:07.215
You're on half rations.
Orders from Cortes.

122
00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:22.230
So, uh, how's the...
How's the escape plan coming?

123
00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:26.067
All right. All right. Wait!

124
00:09:26.817 --> 00:09:28.569
I'm getting something.
Yeah.

125
00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:34.783
Okay!

126
00:09:35.493 --> 00:09:36.535
Here's the plan.

127
00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:39.664
In the dead of night,
you and I grab some provisions... Mm-hm.

128
00:09:39.747 --> 00:09:41.749
Hijack one of those longboats,

129
00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:46.003
and then we row back to Spain
like there's no <i>mañana!</i>

130
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.423
Back to Spain, yeah?
Yeah.

131
00:09:49.507 --> 00:09:51.467
In a rowboat.
You got it!

132
00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:54.595
Great. Sensational.
And that's your plan, is it?

133
00:09:55.096 --> 00:09:56.096
That's pretty much it.

134
00:09:57.223 --> 00:09:57.932
Well, I like it.

135
00:09:58.015 --> 00:09:59.055
So, how do we get on deck?

136
00:09:59.517 --> 00:10:00.517
Hmm.

137
00:10:01.894 --> 00:10:04.939
In the dead of night,
you and I grab some provisions,

138
00:10:05.064 --> 00:10:08.359
hijack one of those longboats...
Uh, great.

139
00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:10.278
Okay, what's your idea, smart guy?

140
00:10:10.361 --> 00:10:12.005
Wh... What do you mean? Don't ask me that!

141
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:13.173
You're the one with the plans.

142
00:10:13.197 --> 00:10:16.367
Wait, I... I have an idea.

143
00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.327
Uh, come on. Give me... Give me a boost.

144
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.330
Hey, Altivo.

145
00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:23.624
Altivo.

146
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.460
You want a nice apple? Come and get it.

147
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:30.548
You have to do a trick for me first.

148
00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:35.386
All you have to do is find a pry bar.

149
00:10:35.928 --> 00:10:39.974
A long piece of iron with a hooky thing
at the end. Yeah?

150
00:10:40.975 --> 00:10:42.643
Miguel, you're talking to a horse!

151
00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:46.981
That's it, Altivo, find the pry bar.

152
00:10:47.106 --> 00:10:49.191
Yes, find the pry bar.

153
00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:52.737
He can't understand "pry bar."

154
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.072
He's a dumb horse. There's no way...

155
00:10:59.994 --> 00:11:03.289
Well... it's not a pry bar.

156
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:23.059
Oh, Altivo. Oh, thank you, old boy.

157
00:11:23.351 --> 00:11:26.354
Listen, if we can ever return the favor...

158
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.359
For Pete's sake, Miguel,
he's a ruthless warhorse, not a poodle.

159
00:11:31.442 --> 00:11:33.527
Come on, before he licks you to death.

160
00:11:33.611 --> 00:11:34.611
<i>Adiós.</i>

161
00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:41.410
Shh, shh. Quiet, please.
Shh.

162
00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:44.163
What's the matter with him?
Oh, he wants his apple.

163
00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:46.406
Well, give it to him before
he wakes up the whole ship!

164
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:50.211
- Fetch!
- Huh?

165
00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:04.266
Huh?

166
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:09.771
Altivo!

167
00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:11.524
Miguel!

168
00:12:14.235 --> 00:12:16.237
Altivo, I'm coming!
Miguel!

169
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.989
Just hang on! I'm right here, old boy!

170
00:12:19.073 --> 00:12:20.491
Have you lost your mind?

171
00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:21.742
Help is coming!

172
00:12:23.702 --> 00:12:26.247
Holy ship!

173
00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:27.748
Whoa!

174
00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:37.091
Loop the rope under the horse!

175
00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:38.425
Yes!

176
00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:47.852
On the count of three,
pull back on the rope!

177
00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:49.937
- What?
- Three!

178
00:12:51.105 --> 00:12:52.940
Pull!

179
00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:02.491
Tulio! Hey, it worked!

180
00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:09.165
Did any of the supplies make it?

181
00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:12.585
Well, uh, yes and no.

182
00:13:14.378 --> 00:13:17.882
Oh, great!

183
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.801
Tulio. Look on the positive side.
At least things can't get...

184
00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:24.805
Excuse me. Were you going to say "worse"?

185
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.224
No. No.
No? You're sure?

186
00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.935
Absolutely not. I've revised
the whole thing. Okay, because...

187
00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:31.687
Yeah,
we're at least in a rowboat.

188
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.105
We're in a rowboat, exactly.

189
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:34.189
You miss nothing.

190
00:13:57.254 --> 00:13:58.464
Ah!

191
00:14:28.244 --> 00:14:32.373
Tulio, did you ever imagine
it would end like this?

192
00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.710
The horse is a surprise.

193
00:14:37.336 --> 00:14:39.922
Any... regrets?

194
00:14:41.048 --> 00:14:43.676
Besides dying? Yeah.

195
00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:49.723
I never... had enough... gold.

196
00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:55.813
My regret, besides dying, is...

197
00:14:56.897 --> 00:15:00.484
our greatest adventure
is over before it began,

198
00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:02.736
and no one will even remember us.

199
00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:06.073
Well, if it's any consolation, Miguel,

200
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.869
you... made my life...

201
00:15:11.537 --> 00:15:13.622
an adventure.

202
00:15:13.706 --> 00:15:16.917
And if it's any consolation, Tulio,

203
00:15:17.126 --> 00:15:21.338
you made my life... rich.

204
00:15:40.441 --> 00:15:42.610
Is it?
Hmm.

205
00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:44.903
It is! It's...

206
00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:47.197
It's land!

207
00:15:56.832 --> 00:15:58.977
All in favor of getting back in the boat,
say "aye." Aye!

208
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:00.628
Aye! Go!

209
00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:18.312
Hey, Miguel! I could use a little help!

210
00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:20.981
Miguel!

211
00:16:22.024 --> 00:16:24.151
Hello!
Tulio! We've done it!

212
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:25.819
What's that? The map?

213
00:16:25.903 --> 00:16:27.696
It's all right here!

214
00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:30.574
You still have the map?

215
00:16:30.658 --> 00:16:32.534
The whistling rock! The stream!

216
00:16:32.618 --> 00:16:35.788
You kept the map,
but you couldn't grab a little more food?

217
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:38.207
Even those mountains.
You said so yourself:

218
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.502
It could be possible. And it is!

219
00:16:41.585 --> 00:16:45.422
It really is the map to El Dorado!

220
00:16:48.217 --> 00:16:49.510
You drank seawater, didn't you?

221
00:16:49.593 --> 00:16:50.761
Oh, come on!

222
00:16:50.844 --> 00:16:52.304
I'm not coming on!

223
00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:55.933
I wouldn't set foot in that jungle
for a million <i>pesetas!</i>

224
00:16:56.725 --> 00:16:59.353
How about a 100 million?

225
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.813
What?

226
00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:04.525
I just thought that, after all,
since El Dorado is the city of gold...

227
00:17:04.942 --> 00:17:05.609
What's your point?

228
00:17:05.693 --> 00:17:07.695
You know, dust, nuggets, bricks,

229
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.614
a temple of gold where you can pluck gold
from the very walls.

230
00:17:10.698 --> 00:17:12.574
But you don't want to go, so

231
00:17:12.658 --> 00:17:15.285
let's get back into the boat
and row back to Spain.

232
00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.954
After all, it worked so well last time.

233
00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.122
Wait!

234
00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:21.750
Mmm. Wait a minute. New plan.

235
00:17:22.835 --> 00:17:27.172
We find the city of gold.
We take the gold,

236
00:17:27.256 --> 00:17:29.133
and then we go back to Spain.

237
00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:30.467
And buy Spain!

238
00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:32.428
Yeah!
That's the spirit!

239
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:36.306
Come on, Tulio. We'll follow that trail!

240
00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:38.224
What trail?

241
00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:41.270
The trail that we blaze!

242
00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:48.444
That trail that we blaze!

243
00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:54.575
Oh, no, you don't.

244
00:17:55.534 --> 00:17:59.288
Yow! Your horse bit me in the butt!

245
00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:10.507
Charge!

246
00:18:25.773 --> 00:18:26.773
What are you looking at?

247
00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.401
Whoa!

248
00:19:03.227 --> 00:19:04.895
Oh! Oh! Oh!

249
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.401
Dinner is served.
Hello.

250
00:21:08.477 --> 00:21:09.478
Hmm.

251
00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:16.485
Miguel. Miguel, wake up.

252
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.278
We're there.
We found it?

253
00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.113
Oh, yeah. We found it.
Oh!

254
00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.449
Fantastic! Where is it? How far?

255
00:21:22.532 --> 00:21:23.367
- Right here!
- Where?

256
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.826
Here.
Behind the rock?

257
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.536
No, no. This is it.

258
00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.079
Give me that!

259
00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:29.538
This ca... What?

260
00:21:29.623 --> 00:21:33.543
Apparently, "El Dorado" is native for...

261
00:21:33.627 --> 00:21:34.878
"Great, big...

262
00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:37.296
rock"!

263
00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:42.612
Hey, but I tell you what,
I'm feeling generous,

264
00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:45.847
so you can have my share!

265
00:21:45.931 --> 00:21:48.809
You don't think Cortes
could've gotten here before us and...

266
00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:51.687
And what? Taken all the really big rocks?

267
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.313
The scoundrel!
Tulio, you...

268
00:21:54.064 --> 00:21:56.125
We have to think about this.
We've come all this way,

269
00:21:56.149 --> 00:22:00.612
and we should really, you know...
Get on the horse!

270
00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:08.036
No, no, no, not with the face. Stop.

271
00:22:08.662 --> 00:22:11.289
Looks like there's
a pass right over there.

272
00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:14.918
Oh!

273
00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:28.849
Hyah!

274
00:22:45.574 --> 00:22:46.908
I've...

275
00:22:48.452 --> 00:22:50.954
Uh, hello. Is this your rock?

276
00:22:51.288 --> 00:22:53.457
Sorry. We were just looking. We're, uh...

277
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.250
We're tourists! Tourist.

278
00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:59.212
We lost our group. May we go now?

279
00:22:59.713 --> 00:23:02.090
Spears.

280
00:23:16.521 --> 00:23:17.898
Hey! Hey!

281
00:24:19.751 --> 00:24:20.836
Oh, my...

282
00:24:24.965 --> 00:24:26.883
It's... It's...

283
00:24:26.967 --> 00:24:29.427
El Dorado.

284
00:25:37.204 --> 00:25:39.998
Mmm. Ah!

285
00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:51.968
Well, it was nice
working with you, partner.

286
00:25:52.052 --> 00:25:54.304
Tulio, I just want you to know,

287
00:25:54.387 --> 00:25:56.223
I'm sorry about that girl in Barcelona.

288
00:25:56.306 --> 00:25:58.225
So, you... You...

289
00:25:58.308 --> 00:25:59.392
Behold!

290
00:25:59.893 --> 00:26:02.062
As the prophesies foretold,

291
00:26:02.145 --> 00:26:05.232
the time of judgment is now!

292
00:26:11.321 --> 00:26:16.201
Citizens, did I not predict
that the gods would come to us?

293
00:26:19.663 --> 00:26:20.330
Hmm.

294
00:26:20.413 --> 00:26:24.000
My lords, I am Tzekel-Kan,

295
00:26:24.084 --> 00:26:27.295
your devoted high priest
and speaker for the gods.

296
00:26:28.588 --> 00:26:29.588
Hey.

297
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:34.427
I am Chief Tannabok.
What names may we call you?

298
00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:36.345
Huh?

299
00:26:36.638 --> 00:26:38.515
I am Miguel.

300
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.934
And I am Tulio.

301
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.604
And they call us Miguel and Tulio!

302
00:26:44.813 --> 00:26:47.774
Your arrival
has been greatly anticipated.

303
00:26:47.857 --> 00:26:50.402
My lords, how long will you
be staying in El Dorado?

304
00:26:51.278 --> 00:26:54.698
Aha! I see you've captured
this temple-robbing thief.

305
00:26:55.573 --> 00:26:58.785
How would you have us punish her?
Oh, no, no, no!

306
00:26:59.286 --> 00:27:01.621
My lord, I am not a thief.

307
00:27:01.705 --> 00:27:04.374
See, the gods sent me a vision...

308
00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:06.793
to bring them tribute from the temple
to guide them here.

309
00:27:08.044 --> 00:27:11.131
My only wish is to serve the gods.

310
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.264
Release her, don't ya think?

311
00:27:21.308 --> 00:27:25.520
Then you will begin by returning this
to its rightful place.

312
00:27:28.815 --> 00:27:32.027
My lords, why now do you choose
to visit us?

313
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.988
Enough! You do not question the gods!

314
00:27:35.322 --> 00:27:37.866
That's right! Do not question us,

315
00:27:37.949 --> 00:27:42.245
or we shall have to unleash
our awesome and terrible power!

316
00:27:42.329 --> 00:27:44.914
And you don't want that!

317
00:27:45.081 --> 00:27:46.583
Well, yes! We do!

318
00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:48.168
You do?

319
00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:52.172
Of course we do!
Visit your wrath upon this nonbeliever!

320
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.132
Show us the truth of your divinity!

321
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:57.677
Divinity! One moment.

322
00:28:02.098 --> 00:28:03.975
Miguel, you know
that little voice people have

323
00:28:04.059 --> 00:28:06.102
that tells them to quit
when they're ahead?

324
00:28:06.186 --> 00:28:06.978
You don't have one!

325
00:28:07.103 --> 00:28:09.606
Well, I'm sorry. I just got carried away!
Way away!

326
00:28:09.689 --> 00:28:12.567
Maybe we should tell
the truth and beg for mercy.

327
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.736
Are you nuts? We'd be butchered alive!

328
00:28:14.819 --> 00:28:16.130
Yes, but they're getting suspicious.

329
00:28:16.154 --> 00:28:18.314
And if we don't come up
with some mega-cosmic event...

330
00:28:22.202 --> 00:28:24.802
I'm trying! I'm trying!
I can't think with all these distractions!

331
00:28:25.622 --> 00:28:27.707
You and your horse...
Think, think, think!

332
00:28:27.791 --> 00:28:29.292
I'm on the verge of...

333
00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:30.376
Stop!

334
00:28:59.572 --> 00:29:01.241
Don't make me start it up again,

335
00:29:01.324 --> 00:29:02.450
'cause I will.

336
00:29:08.873 --> 00:29:11.501
Oh, mighty lords!

337
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.754
Come. Let me show you to your temple.

338
00:29:14.963 --> 00:29:17.090
All right! Temple.

339
00:29:19.926 --> 00:29:21.511
Step aside.

340
00:30:05.305 --> 00:30:09.309
To commemorate your arrival,
I propose a reverent ceremony at dawn.

341
00:30:09.934 --> 00:30:15.190
Ah, then perhaps I could prepare
a glorious feast for you tonight.

342
00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:18.651
Which would you prefer?

343
00:30:20.195 --> 00:30:21.195
Both.
Both.

344
00:30:21.362 --> 00:30:22.238
Both.

345
00:30:22.322 --> 00:30:23.322
Both is good.

346
00:30:25.033 --> 00:30:27.160
My lords.
My lords.

347
00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:33.750
And so dawns the Age of the Jaguar.

348
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:38.505
Happy new year.

349
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:47.013
Hey!
Hey, hey.

350
00:30:52.685 --> 00:30:57.357
Tulio. Tulio.
They actually think we're gods.

351
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.528
It's an entire city of suckers.

352
00:31:01.611 --> 00:31:03.613
We just have to keep this up long enough

353
00:31:03.696 --> 00:31:07.075
to load up on the gold
and then get the hell out of here!

354
00:31:07.158 --> 00:31:09.702
Tulio, we'll be living like kings!

355
00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:11.579
Miguel and Tulio!

356
00:31:11.663 --> 00:31:12.872
Tulio and Miguel!

357
00:31:12.997 --> 00:31:15.333
Mighty and powerful gods.
Gods.

358
00:31:15.416 --> 00:31:16.416
Hello.

359
00:31:19.546 --> 00:31:21.381
Depart, mortal,

360
00:31:21.506 --> 00:31:24.551
before we strike you with a lightning bolt.
Mmm. Mmm!

361
00:31:26.386 --> 00:31:29.347
Beware the wrath of the gods!
Begone!

362
00:31:29.722 --> 00:31:32.433
Save it for the high priest, honey.
You're gonna need it.

363
00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:34.894
Miguel, it's not working.

364
00:31:35.019 --> 00:31:37.480
Miguel! We've been caught.

365
00:31:37.564 --> 00:31:39.607
Oh, no. Don't worry about me, boys.

366
00:31:40.066 --> 00:31:43.570
"My only wish is to serve the gods."
Remember?

367
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:45.738
How?

368
00:31:45.822 --> 00:31:49.576
Well, if you guys want the gold,
then you don't want to get caught, right?

369
00:31:49.826 --> 00:31:51.494
You're going to need my help.

370
00:31:51.578 --> 00:31:53.997
What makes you think
we need your help?

371
00:31:55.123 --> 00:31:56.958
Are you serious?

372
00:32:01.379 --> 00:32:04.257
Okay. So, uh, who are you?

373
00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.967
Yeah, uh, what's your angle?

374
00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.552
No angle.

375
00:32:08.595 --> 00:32:09.429
I want in.

376
00:32:09.512 --> 00:32:10.179
In?

377
00:32:10.263 --> 00:32:11.431
On the scam.

378
00:32:13.308 --> 00:32:15.602
There's no scam!
Why would you think there's a...

379
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:16.894
Why?

380
00:32:16.978 --> 00:32:18.605
So I can get out.

381
00:32:18.688 --> 00:32:20.690
I thought she just said she wanted in.

382
00:32:20.773 --> 00:32:23.109
She wants in so she can get out.

383
00:32:23.401 --> 00:32:25.320
Aha! Got it.

384
00:32:26.446 --> 00:32:27.322
Why?

385
00:32:27.405 --> 00:32:30.241
Think you're the only ones
who dream of better things?

386
00:32:30.658 --> 00:32:33.786
Of adventure? You've got your reasons,

387
00:32:34.495 --> 00:32:35.495
and I've got mine.

388
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:38.041
Let's not make it personal, okay?

389
00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:40.126
It's just business.

390
00:32:41.002 --> 00:32:42.002
Oh.

391
00:32:42.462 --> 00:32:46.966
So when you guys are ready to go back to
wherever you came from,

392
00:32:47.634 --> 00:32:48.843
I'm going with you.

393
00:32:50.136 --> 00:32:52.221
No! Don't think so.

394
00:32:55.308 --> 00:32:56.851
All right. Fine.

395
00:32:57.644 --> 00:32:59.354
After all, I'm sure you know

396
00:32:59.437 --> 00:33:02.565
the proper rituals for blessing a tribute,
the holiest days on the calendar...

397
00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:05.985
Oh, and of course you know
all about Xibalba.

398
00:33:06.653 --> 00:33:08.029
Okay.

399
00:33:09.072 --> 00:33:10.072
Good luck.

400
00:33:12.408 --> 00:33:13.951
See you at the execution.

401
00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:17.664
Wait! Ho... Would you... Hold it.

402
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:25.088
Deal?
Hmm.

403
00:33:25.588 --> 00:33:28.675
Deal. Not yet. Let's just
see how this works out.

404
00:33:29.884 --> 00:33:33.763
Uh-huh. Well, then I suppose that means
you'll want these back?

405
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.393
How'd you get those?
Where was she keeping them?

406
00:33:39.852 --> 00:33:41.979
Call me, Chel, your new partner.

407
00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:44.649
Uh, that's partner-in-training.

408
00:33:44.732 --> 00:33:45.732
Now, put these on.

409
00:33:46.526 --> 00:33:49.362
Your public's waiting.

410
00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.281
Do you mind?

411
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.990
No.

412
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.202
Oh! Oh! Oh!

413
00:33:56.744 --> 00:33:58.454
Right. Uh, excuse me.

414
00:34:00.873 --> 00:34:01.873
Bye.

415
00:34:03.793 --> 00:34:07.755
Mm-mm-mmm! Maybe they should call
this place "Chel Dorado."

416
00:34:07.839 --> 00:34:10.717
She's wh...

417
00:34:10.842 --> 00:34:13.136
Whoa, she's trouble! Wait a minute!
What?

418
00:34:13.386 --> 00:34:15.304
The little voice?
Remember the little voice?

419
00:34:15.388 --> 00:34:18.266
Just for a second
imagine that you have one.

420
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:20.727
What would it be saying about Chel?

421
00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:25.314
No. No. Listen.

422
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.066
We are partners.
We are partners.

423
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.318
We have a plan, remember?

424
00:34:29.402 --> 00:34:30.987
Get the gold. Go back to Spain.

425
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.407
Yes! And we are pretending to be gods.

426
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:37.326
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?

427
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:39.579
Listen carefully.

428
00:34:41.247 --> 00:34:44.250
Chel is off-limits, hmm?

429
00:34:44.333 --> 00:34:47.670
Bravo! Chel is off-limits! Shake on it.

430
00:34:48.546 --> 00:34:49.630
Off-limits.
Mm. Mm.

431
00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:50.757
Mmm.

432
00:34:51.799 --> 00:34:53.843
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.

433
00:34:53.926 --> 00:34:56.095
We must avoid giving in to temptation.

434
00:34:56.304 --> 00:35:00.391
Gods. Oh. This is gonna to be tougher
than I thought.

435
00:35:00.475 --> 00:35:01.976
Tulio, relax!

436
00:35:02.059 --> 00:35:05.938
All you have to do is smile,
act godly and follow my lead.

437
00:35:10.276 --> 00:35:11.944
Big smile. Like you mean it.

438
00:35:12.945 --> 00:35:14.030
A-one, two, three.

439
00:35:30.296 --> 00:35:32.965
Tulio, what are you talking about?

440
00:36:33.734 --> 00:36:35.486
You have a point there.
Very good thinking.

441
00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:39.739
Yeah!

442
00:36:41.742 --> 00:36:42.742
Thank you.

443
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:01.345
It's great advice!

444
00:37:20.907 --> 00:37:21.907
You got it!

445
00:37:56.943 --> 00:37:57.943
Ah!

446
00:37:58.194 --> 00:38:00.571
Good morning, my lords!

447
00:38:02.448 --> 00:38:03.491
He's back!

448
00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:05.201
Oh, no.

449
00:38:07.787 --> 00:38:09.372
And now it's my turn.

450
00:38:13.459 --> 00:38:15.670
The gods have awakened!

451
00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:20.800
Whoa!

452
00:38:20.883 --> 00:38:21.884
Mm-hmm.

453
00:38:25.805 --> 00:38:27.974
Hey, Chel, what's going on?

454
00:38:28.057 --> 00:38:30.101
It's not gonna be good.

455
00:38:31.435 --> 00:38:32.103
Thank you.

456
00:38:32.144 --> 00:38:34.814
This city has been
granted a great blessing.

457
00:38:34.897 --> 00:38:39.568
And what have we done
to show our gratitude?

458
00:38:39.652 --> 00:38:42.446
A meager celebration.

459
00:38:43.489 --> 00:38:45.992
The gods deserve a proper tribute!

460
00:38:50.496 --> 00:38:51.496
Hmm.
Hmm.

461
00:38:51.622 --> 00:38:56.168
The beginning of a new era,
the dawning of a new age,

462
00:38:56.252 --> 00:38:57.586
demands...

463
00:38:58.587 --> 00:39:00.339
sacrifice!

464
00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:11.517
I don't like this.
Tulio, we've got to do something.

465
00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:21.861
Stop!

466
00:39:23.529 --> 00:39:24.530
Hmm?

467
00:39:27.658 --> 00:39:30.119
This is not a proper tribute!

468
00:39:30.202 --> 00:39:32.204
You do not want the tribute?

469
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:34.373
No. No, no. W... We want tribute.

470
00:39:35.041 --> 00:39:38.377
Uh, it's just that, uh... Tulio, tell him.

471
00:39:40.546 --> 00:39:44.633
The stars are not in position
for this tribute!

472
00:39:44.717 --> 00:39:46.761
Like he says, stars...

473
00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:48.511
Can't do it.

474
00:39:49.638 --> 00:39:50.638
Not today.

475
00:39:55.686 --> 00:39:57.104
Ah...

476
00:39:57.188 --> 00:40:00.483
Perhaps it is possible
I misread the heavens.

477
00:40:00.566 --> 00:40:01.650
Don't worry about it.

478
00:40:02.193 --> 00:40:04.695
To err is human, to forgive...
Hmm.

479
00:40:04.779 --> 00:40:09.116
My lords, may the people of El Dorado
offer you our tribute.

480
00:40:20.252 --> 00:40:23.255
My lords, does this please you?

481
00:40:23.923 --> 00:40:25.966
Yes, very nice.

482
00:40:26.092 --> 00:40:28.094
Certainly acceptable.
Yes, lovely. It'll do.

483
00:40:28.302 --> 00:40:30.304
The gods have chosen!

484
00:40:31.514 --> 00:40:33.057
To Xibalba?

485
00:40:35.434 --> 00:40:36.102
No. No.

486
00:40:36.268 --> 00:40:38.604
To Xibalba!

487
00:40:38.938 --> 00:40:40.606
Oh, great.

488
00:40:54.745 --> 00:40:57.581
Hey, Chel, um, what are they doing?

489
00:40:58.124 --> 00:41:01.585
They're sending it to Xibalba,
the spirit world.

490
00:41:03.796 --> 00:41:06.090
The spirit world.
I'll take care of it.

491
00:41:07.591 --> 00:41:10.469
Um, excuse me, Chief.

492
00:41:10.553 --> 00:41:13.305
The gods have changed their minds
about Xibalba.

493
00:41:16.058 --> 00:41:19.103
They wish to bask in the reverence
that has been shown them.

494
00:41:20.938 --> 00:41:21.981
Stop!

495
00:41:26.819 --> 00:41:29.029
They wish to bask!

496
00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.825
Take the tribute to the gods' temple!

497
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:37.163
Nice going.

498
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:49.175
Smile while you can.

499
00:42:01.187 --> 00:42:02.646
Well, well, well.

500
00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:06.192
What have we here?

501
00:42:09.778 --> 00:42:12.072
- Ay-ay-ay.
<i>- Tons of gold for you, hah</i>

502
00:42:12.198 --> 00:42:15.534
<i>And tons of gold for me, hoo!
Tons of gold for we, ah!</i>

503
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.038
Not bad for a day's work, eh?
Not bad at all.

504
00:42:19.538 --> 00:42:22.625
We just became richer
than the king of Spain.

505
00:42:22.708 --> 00:42:24.585
You know, speaking of kings,

506
00:42:24.919 --> 00:42:28.297
the chief and high priest
seem a bit, uh... tense.

507
00:42:28.464 --> 00:42:29.715
<i>Buenos días!</i>

508
00:42:30.716 --> 00:42:32.718
Listen, all <i>we</i> have to do...

509
00:42:33.135 --> 00:42:37.181
is keep playing the one against the other.

510
00:42:37.556 --> 00:42:40.351
You know, do a little god dance,
chant some mystic mumbo jumbo,

511
00:42:40.434 --> 00:42:43.121
dazzle 'em with some smoke and mirrors
and then get the hell back to Spain.

512
00:42:43.145 --> 00:42:47.483
Um, Tulio, how are we gonna
get all this back to Spain?

513
00:42:48.359 --> 00:42:50.069
Umm...

514
00:42:51.403 --> 00:42:52.403
- A boat?
- Yeah.

515
00:42:53.239 --> 00:42:56.158
Um, we really hate
to be ascending so soon,

516
00:42:56.242 --> 00:42:58.535
but, uh, some
urgent business has come up,

517
00:42:58.661 --> 00:43:00.889
family matters, you know,
and it's just a bit... Yeah, family.

518
00:43:00.913 --> 00:43:03.082
Bada-bing, bada-boom,
you know what I mean.

519
00:43:03.707 --> 00:43:06.794
Oh, we expected you to be staying with us
for the next...

520
00:43:07.544 --> 00:43:08.754
thousand years.

521
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.423
Well, as we say in the spirit world,

522
00:43:11.465 --> 00:43:14.885
there's your plan and then...
there's the gods' plan. Mm-hmm.

523
00:43:14.969 --> 00:43:17.888
And our plan, uh, calls for a boat,
'cause we're gonna ascend...

524
00:43:18.013 --> 00:43:20.557
kind of in a horizontal pattern at first.

525
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:24.436
And then we're gonna go vertical, uh,
as we get further out to sea.

526
00:43:24.937 --> 00:43:28.107
Hmm. To build a boat
large and glorious enough

527
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.109
would take about a week.

528
00:43:30.776 --> 00:43:32.820
A week? Hmm.
Um...

529
00:43:33.612 --> 00:43:36.532
I wonder how long it would take
Tzekel-Kan to do it.

530
00:43:36.615 --> 00:43:38.450
But... But for the gods, uh...

531
00:43:39.368 --> 00:43:40.536
three days.

532
00:43:40.828 --> 00:43:41.912
Uh...

533
00:43:42.496 --> 00:43:44.999
Well, if that's the best you can do.

534
00:43:45.416 --> 00:43:49.628
Oh, perhaps if you were not burdened
with so much tribute,

535
00:43:50.004 --> 00:43:51.630
you could leave sooner.

536
00:43:52.089 --> 00:43:54.383
Hmm?
Hmm? I like it here. Miguel?

537
00:43:54.466 --> 00:43:56.635
Yep, yep. Three days is just fine.

538
00:43:57.761 --> 00:44:00.306
No, three days is not fine.

539
00:44:00.889 --> 00:44:02.057
This is a real...

540
00:44:02.641 --> 00:44:03.684
Mmm.

541
00:44:04.018 --> 00:44:05.311
These, these are the ones.

542
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:06.811
Oh. Thank you.

543
00:44:06.979 --> 00:44:07.979
Problem.

544
00:44:08.314 --> 00:44:11.483
Miguel, how are we gonna keep this up
for three days?

545
00:44:11.942 --> 00:44:13.110
You worry too much.

546
00:44:13.193 --> 00:44:15.321
No, I worry exactly the right amount.

547
00:44:15.779 --> 00:44:18.282
You can never worry too much.

548
00:44:19.074 --> 00:44:21.827
We just have to lie low.

549
00:44:23.078 --> 00:44:27.249
But, Tulio, this place is amazing!
I mean, I wonder what's...

550
00:44:27.333 --> 00:44:29.835
No! Don't even move!

551
00:44:30.085 --> 00:44:31.754
- Tulio...
- You're moving!

552
00:44:31.837 --> 00:44:33.672
- A little, but...
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

553
00:44:33.756 --> 00:44:34.506
Come on.

554
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:35.841
- I gotta... I...
- Stay!

555
00:44:37.509 --> 00:44:40.012
- I just...
- Just... stand there!

556
00:44:41.972 --> 00:44:43.849
For three days?

557
00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:45.934
Yes! Exactly.

558
00:44:46.352 --> 00:44:48.354
For three days. Don't even breathe.

559
00:44:49.146 --> 00:44:50.146
All right?

560
00:44:51.982 --> 00:44:52.982
All right.

561
00:44:53.192 --> 00:44:53.901
We lie low.

562
00:44:53.984 --> 00:44:55.819
Nah-ah-ah. Promise?

563
00:44:56.028 --> 00:44:57.946
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, all right.

564
00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:00.157
Great! Good. Okay.

565
00:45:01.533 --> 00:45:04.787
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to gloat over my gold.

566
00:45:10.959 --> 00:45:12.378
Oh, yum, yum, yum.

567
00:45:14.963 --> 00:45:16.465
It's beautiful, isn't it?

568
00:45:17.132 --> 00:45:18.132
Yeah.

569
00:45:18.634 --> 00:45:20.194
You know, you really shouldn't miss it.

570
00:45:20.803 --> 00:45:23.389
I know. But I couldn't.

571
00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:26.225
Go ahead. I'll cover for you.

572
00:45:26.725 --> 00:45:28.435
Oh, good. Thanks.

573
00:45:30.229 --> 00:45:33.023
So, what happened to Altivo?
I don't know.

574
00:45:37.236 --> 00:45:40.280
Hey, what happened to Miguel?
I don't know.

575
00:45:40.447 --> 00:45:44.326
Oh, my God! He's gone! Miguel's gone!

576
00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:46.328
He's loose! What am I gonna do?

577
00:45:46.412 --> 00:45:50.040
Oh, no, no!

578
00:45:50.124 --> 00:45:53.752
Oh, Miguel is right. You worry too much.

579
00:45:55.754 --> 00:45:58.757
Oh. Ooh.

580
00:45:59.383 --> 00:46:03.220
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, down, down, down.

581
00:46:03.303 --> 00:46:04.638
No! No!

582
00:46:04.763 --> 00:46:06.432
Big trouble.

583
00:46:06.807 --> 00:46:08.392
Whoa!

584
00:46:08.892 --> 00:46:11.979
Look, sweetheart,
we're in the middle of a con here,

585
00:46:12.062 --> 00:46:13.856
walking the razor's edge.

586
00:46:14.606 --> 00:46:16.733
On the one hand, gold!

587
00:46:17.443 --> 00:46:20.946
On the other hand,
painful, agonizing failure!

588
00:46:22.114 --> 00:46:25.325
I can't afford
any tempt a... uh, distractions.

589
00:46:25.868 --> 00:46:26.868
So, I'm sorry.

590
00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:29.037
So sorry.

591
00:46:29.246 --> 00:46:32.958
But perhaps another time?
Another place, hmm?

592
00:46:33.041 --> 00:46:35.836
Too bad. I'm free now.

593
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:41.258
I'm... not really sure I trust you.

594
00:46:41.633 --> 00:46:44.261
Mmm, I'm not really
asking you to trust me.

595
00:46:44.636 --> 00:46:46.138
Am I?
Whoo.

596
00:46:48.056 --> 00:46:49.056
'Kay.

597
00:46:52.144 --> 00:46:54.396
Ooh, yeah.

598
00:47:16.418 --> 00:47:17.419
Excuse me.

599
00:47:17.503 --> 00:47:18.921
Excuse me?

600
00:47:20.172 --> 00:47:22.299
Hey, where is everybody?

601
00:47:23.008 --> 00:47:24.819
They've been cleared
from the streets, my lord,

602
00:47:24.843 --> 00:47:27.888
so the city can be cleansed,
as you ordered.

603
00:47:29.139 --> 00:47:30.682
Cleansed?
Yes.

604
00:47:31.308 --> 00:47:33.310
So the Age of the Jaguar can begin,

605
00:47:34.228 --> 00:47:36.104
as you ordered, my lord.
Get back in!

606
00:47:36.438 --> 00:47:37.998
- Where are you going?
- Hey, stop that!

607
00:47:38.357 --> 00:47:40.025
- Move!
- Hey, stop that!

608
00:47:40.108 --> 00:47:41.902
What are you doing? Stop that!

609
00:47:42.361 --> 00:47:44.780
But, my lord, anyone
who disobeys your orders

610
00:47:44.863 --> 00:47:46.740
must be punished, as you ordered.

611
00:47:48.325 --> 00:47:50.405
It seems I've been giving
a lot of orders, haven't I?

612
00:47:50.953 --> 00:47:53.372
Tzekel-Kan has made
your commands clear, my lord.

613
00:47:53.705 --> 00:47:54.706
Really?

614
00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:58.377
Here's an order. Take the day off.
Huh?

615
00:48:00.796 --> 00:48:01.922
Are you all right?

616
00:48:04.383 --> 00:48:05.592
Here.

617
00:48:07.094 --> 00:48:09.221
Oh, no! It's all right.

618
00:48:09.846 --> 00:48:10.846
Please.

619
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:26.738
Hey, Altivo. There you are.

620
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:35.205
Oh.
Oh.

621
00:50:40.414 --> 00:50:41.414
Hmm.

622
00:50:42.249 --> 00:50:43.458
This is not what I expected.

623
00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:47.879
Perhaps Lord Tulio will enlighten me.

624
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:52.591
How do I look?

625
00:50:53.343 --> 00:50:55.804
Oh, uh... Well, you...

626
00:50:55.887 --> 00:50:57.180
Oh, shut up.

627
00:50:57.973 --> 00:51:00.600
Oh! Whoa!

628
00:51:00.684 --> 00:51:01.935
My lord?

629
00:51:03.061 --> 00:51:04.104
Hello?

630
00:51:04.187 --> 00:51:05.480
The high priest.
Ow!

631
00:51:05.564 --> 00:51:09.609
What's he gonna think if he finds
one of the gods like this with me?

632
00:51:09.693 --> 00:51:11.111
Uh, "Lucky god"?

633
00:51:12.279 --> 00:51:14.322
Just... Just... Just...

634
00:51:14.406 --> 00:51:15.866
Hello?
Whoa!

635
00:51:18.869 --> 00:51:20.662
Oh, Tzekel-Kan!

636
00:51:20.746 --> 00:51:21.663
What brings you here?

637
00:51:21.747 --> 00:51:25.667
I humbly request
an audience with you, my lord.

638
00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:27.919
"Lord", yes, what can I do for you?

639
00:51:28.003 --> 00:51:31.423
My lord, I have just seen Lord Miguel
out among the people.

640
00:51:31.506 --> 00:51:32.506
Really?

641
00:51:33.008 --> 00:51:35.260
If I may be so bold
as to offer some advice.

642
00:51:35.343 --> 00:51:36.720
All right. Shoot.

643
00:51:37.179 --> 00:51:40.557
My lord, you are perfect.

644
00:51:40.891 --> 00:51:42.726
Oh, well. Go on.

645
00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:47.856
But in your perfection, you cannot know
how imperfect humans are.

646
00:51:48.482 --> 00:51:50.650
Like snakes they are.

647
00:51:51.276 --> 00:51:53.612
Spineless and slippery.

648
00:51:54.279 --> 00:51:58.784
They are as untrustworthy as rats,
stealing and cheating with no remorse.

649
00:51:59.951 --> 00:52:03.622
Spinning webs of lies, like spiders!

650
00:52:04.414 --> 00:52:06.833
Stop it! That's disgusting.

651
00:52:08.084 --> 00:52:09.711
They're beyond disgusting!

652
00:52:09.961 --> 00:52:13.089
Yeah, yeah, way beyond.
Then we're in agreement.

653
00:52:13.173 --> 00:52:15.300
I'll begin the necessary
preparations immediately.

654
00:52:15.884 --> 00:52:18.220
Now, do you wish to have your victims
bound to an altar,

655
00:52:18.637 --> 00:52:20.472
or would you prefer them free-range?

656
00:52:21.807 --> 00:52:23.850
And will you be devouring
their essence whole,

657
00:52:23.934 --> 00:52:25.644
or piece by piece?

658
00:52:27.437 --> 00:52:28.480
Tzekel, you've lost me.

659
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:32.734
My lord, these people will not respect you
if they do not fear you.

660
00:52:32.818 --> 00:52:35.320
And, of course,
we'll make them fear us by...

661
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.906
A sacrifice, as it is prophesied.

662
00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:40.909
The history of the Age of the Jaguar
will be written in...

663
00:52:40.992 --> 00:52:41.660
Ink?

664
00:52:41.743 --> 00:52:43.662
Blood!
Blood! Oh, right.

665
00:52:44.162 --> 00:52:46.915
Of course. I should probably consult
with Lord Miguel.

666
00:52:46.998 --> 00:52:50.710
This is fairly important stuff.
I, um, should discuss the entire, uh,

667
00:52:50.794 --> 00:52:54.256
blood issue right away.

668
00:52:54.339 --> 00:52:55.841
Excuse us, won't you? Let's go.

669
00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:01.555
Finally... we're connecting.

670
00:53:12.774 --> 00:53:13.817
This way.

671
00:53:21.992 --> 00:53:24.160
What do you think you're doing?

672
00:53:24.703 --> 00:53:26.288
Lying low.

673
00:53:26.496 --> 00:53:28.790
Look, change of plans.

674
00:53:28.874 --> 00:53:31.418
We have to grab what we can carry
and get out of here now!

675
00:53:31.501 --> 00:53:32.794
What? Why?

676
00:53:32.878 --> 00:53:35.463
Because the high priest is nuts!
He wants...

677
00:53:35.547 --> 00:53:36.548
This is unacceptable!

678
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:38.049
Yeah. Yeah. Like he said.

679
00:53:38.133 --> 00:53:41.595
The gods should not be playing ball
like this!

680
00:53:41.678 --> 00:53:42.721
Well, exactly!

681
00:53:42.804 --> 00:53:46.474
This is how the gods should play ball!

682
00:53:50.437 --> 00:53:53.064
Well, don't blame me.
I blame you.

683
00:53:54.733 --> 00:53:58.111
What is the object of this game,
pray tell?

684
00:53:58.528 --> 00:54:00.288
You've gotta knock the ball
through the hoop.

685
00:54:00.739 --> 00:54:02.324
What hoop?
That hoop.

686
00:54:03.533 --> 00:54:05.243
That's impossible.

687
00:54:05.327 --> 00:54:06.077
We're gonna lose.

688
00:54:06.161 --> 00:54:07.913
Gods don't lose.

689
00:54:12.459 --> 00:54:13.668
Heep-ha!

690
00:54:13.919 --> 00:54:17.422
My lords, Chief Tannabok's warriors
are the finest ballplayers in the city.

691
00:54:17.547 --> 00:54:21.885
Fifteen mere mortals against two gods.

692
00:54:23.553 --> 00:54:25.180
I realize it's a bit uneven,
Heep-ha!

693
00:54:26.056 --> 00:54:29.016
But I do hope they'll challenge you enough
to make the game... interesting.

694
00:54:30.435 --> 00:54:31.435
Play ball!

695
00:54:35.023 --> 00:54:37.525
Crush them into the dust.

696
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:39.277
Enjoy.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

697
00:54:54.042 --> 00:54:55.543
My lords,

698
00:54:55.794 --> 00:54:58.630
were you not supposed
to put the ball into play?

699
00:54:58.922 --> 00:55:00.256
Oh!

700
00:55:00.674 --> 00:55:03.051
Well, no, no, no.

701
00:55:03.134 --> 00:55:08.306
We were merely demonstrating the, um,
traditional, uh, first avoidance maneuver.

702
00:55:09.516 --> 00:55:10.642
Ah.

703
00:55:11.518 --> 00:55:13.103
I've never heard of such a thing.

704
00:55:14.187 --> 00:55:15.981
Excuse me.

705
00:55:16.314 --> 00:55:18.775
Who invented this game?

706
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:22.779
Why, the gods, of course.

707
00:55:23.989 --> 00:55:26.741
I'm warning you,
don't push your luck with this guy.

708
00:55:27.033 --> 00:55:29.953
But, Tulio, we're the gods.

709
00:55:36.501 --> 00:55:38.712
Tulio! The hip! The hip!

710
00:55:38.795 --> 00:55:40.338
Ah!

711
00:55:42.173 --> 00:55:44.759
This is impossible.

712
00:55:50.348 --> 00:55:51.348
Excuse me.

713
00:55:51.516 --> 00:55:53.018
- Heep...
- Ha!

714
00:55:56.688 --> 00:55:58.940
Heep-ha! Heep-ha! Heep-ha!

715
00:56:08.783 --> 00:56:10.702
Foul! That was a foul!

716
00:56:15.957 --> 00:56:17.000
New ball!

717
00:56:21.546 --> 00:56:23.298
How long does this go on anyway?

718
00:56:23.548 --> 00:56:26.217
The game is over
when the shadow touches this line.

719
00:56:26.426 --> 00:56:29.512
We need a miracle.
No, we need to cheat.

720
00:56:45.945 --> 00:56:46.945
Yes!

721
00:56:51.701 --> 00:56:52.701
Huh?

722
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:55.370
Hey!

723
00:57:00.502 --> 00:57:01.711
<i>Olé!</i>

724
00:57:09.761 --> 00:57:10.845
Huh?

725
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:13.430
Hmm.

726
00:57:14.849 --> 00:57:15.975
Yes!

727
00:57:16.059 --> 00:57:18.103
Who's the god?
You the god.

728
00:57:18.228 --> 00:57:20.188
No, you the god.
No, you the god.

729
00:57:20.355 --> 00:57:21.355
Fine.

730
00:57:21.648 --> 00:57:24.067
Yeah! Yeah!

731
00:57:33.993 --> 00:57:36.746
Guys, it's here!
It's right here with me!

732
00:58:07.777 --> 00:58:10.321
I love this game!

733
00:58:10.655 --> 00:58:12.657
Yes!

734
00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:15.618
Well done, partner.

735
00:58:15.869 --> 00:58:16.869
Yes! Yes!

736
00:58:16.911 --> 00:58:19.205
My lords, congratulations on your victory.

737
00:58:19.289 --> 00:58:22.333
And now, you will, of course,
wish to have the losing team

738
00:58:22.417 --> 00:58:24.752
sacrificed to your glory.

739
00:58:27.088 --> 00:58:28.506
Not again.

740
00:58:29.174 --> 00:58:31.259
Look, Tzekel-Kan, Uh, Miguel?

741
00:58:31.342 --> 00:58:33.761
Forget the sacrifices.
Miguel.

742
00:58:33.845 --> 00:58:35.930
We don't want any sacrifices.

743
00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:41.394
But all of the sacred writings say that you
will devour the wicked and the unrighteous.

744
00:58:41.477 --> 00:58:44.022
Well, I don't see anyone here
who fits that description.

745
00:58:45.815 --> 00:58:47.817
Well, as speaker for the gods,

746
00:58:47.901 --> 00:58:51.779
it would be my privilege
to point them out.

747
00:58:51.863 --> 00:58:55.116
The gods are speaking for themselves now!

748
00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:59.787
This city and these people
have no need for you anymore!

749
00:59:01.497 --> 00:59:03.708
There will be no sacrifices!

750
00:59:04.876 --> 00:59:07.462
Not now, not ever!

751
00:59:10.048 --> 00:59:11.048
Get out!

752
00:59:24.646 --> 00:59:25.646
Mmm.

753
00:59:26.105 --> 00:59:27.273
As the

754
00:59:27.899 --> 00:59:30.818
gods... command.

755
00:59:33.988 --> 00:59:35.823
Whoa! Whoa!

756
00:59:35.907 --> 00:59:39.827
Hey, not bad
for my first commandment, huh?

757
00:59:39.911 --> 00:59:41.955
Miguel, the little voice...

758
00:59:42.038 --> 00:59:43.498
Yeah, fine.

759
00:59:47.418 --> 00:59:50.588
Do you know why the gods demand blood?

760
00:59:51.297 --> 00:59:52.297
I don't know.

761
00:59:53.466 --> 00:59:56.928
Because gods don't bleed.

762
01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:04.269
It's time to take the future
into my own hands,

763
01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:06.646
and this city will be cleansed.

764
01:00:06.729 --> 01:00:08.690
Even if I have to do it myself.

765
01:00:09.857 --> 01:00:11.693
Uh, how?

766
01:00:12.902 --> 01:00:14.862
There are dark magics here,

767
01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:18.366
and power, and...

768
01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.910
Ooh. My, my, my.

769
01:00:21.911 --> 01:00:24.956
It's not called the Age of the Jaguar
for nothing.

770
01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:34.299
This'll be a delightful way
to bid the false gods... goodbye.

771
01:00:47.854 --> 01:00:48.855
Hmm.

772
01:00:48.938 --> 01:00:51.149
<i>Adiós, muchacho!</i>

773
01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.584
Well, it's, um, uh, nice.

774
01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:10.501
Nice?

775
01:01:10.585 --> 01:01:12.003
Yes, nice.
But?

776
01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:16.883
Um, but, uh, is it really fit
for the gods?

777
01:01:16.966 --> 01:01:18.593
My lord.

778
01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:22.805
I have been around boats, believe me,

779
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:26.392
and that, um... The pointy, tall, um...

780
01:01:26.476 --> 01:01:28.853
The long up-and-down thing...

781
01:01:28.978 --> 01:01:32.106
The mast?
The mast, yes, yes. The mast is good.

782
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.443
Well, look at it.
There's not nearly enough, uh,

783
01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:37.612
um, rope.

784
01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:38.529
Rope?

785
01:01:38.613 --> 01:01:40.865
Yes, rope. Exactly my point.

786
01:01:40.948 --> 01:01:44.535
Vertical ascension requires
a lot more, uh, rope.

787
01:01:44.786 --> 01:01:46.120
My lord.

788
01:01:46.204 --> 01:01:49.123
And look at this.

789
01:01:50.833 --> 01:01:52.293
This doesn't look at all secure.

790
01:01:52.377 --> 01:01:56.589
Chief, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
but all in all, it is a complete do-over.

791
01:02:02.762 --> 01:02:03.762
Hmm.

792
01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.225
You know, Lord Miguel,

793
01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:10.103
if you wish to stay,

794
01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:13.064
you only need to say so.

795
01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:16.067
You mean, forever?

796
01:02:16.818 --> 01:02:18.069
Of course.

797
01:02:22.323 --> 01:02:25.159
Oh, no, I can't.
I have to go back with Tulio.

798
01:02:25.243 --> 01:02:27.245
We're... We're partners.

799
01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.415
Big plans in the other world, huh?

800
01:02:32.375 --> 01:02:34.252
Yep. Big plans.

801
01:02:34.919 --> 01:02:39.340
Well, then, I better
go get some more rope, huh?

802
01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:41.843
Oh, Chief, um, forget about the rope.

803
01:02:42.385 --> 01:02:44.345
Um, my mistake.

804
01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:46.973
Hey, to err is human.

805
01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:01.736
Half?

806
01:03:03.281 --> 01:03:04.031
Mm-hmm.

807
01:03:04.115 --> 01:03:06.826
I don't think so.

808
01:03:06.909 --> 01:03:07.910
I'll tell you what.

809
01:03:08.244 --> 01:03:10.538
Uh, I'll let you come back
to Spain with us,

810
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:15.126
like you wanted, and, um, yeah,
I can see my way clear to throwing you,

811
01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:16.961
mmm, ten percent?

812
01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:21.132
You know, maybe I won't go
to Spain with you and take a third.

813
01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:23.718
Oh!

814
01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.386
Like you don't wanna go to Spain.

815
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:28.264
Oh, like you don't want me
to want to go to Spain.

816
01:03:28.556 --> 01:03:30.558
I want you to want...
Mm-hmm?

817
01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:32.643
What you want.

818
01:03:33.561 --> 01:03:35.062
Mm-hmm. Go on.

819
01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:38.649
All right. Cards on the table.

820
01:03:39.567 --> 01:03:42.445
Uh, I want you to come to Spain
with me and Miguel.

821
01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:45.281
Mostly me. Especially me.

822
01:03:45.907 --> 01:03:47.658
Only me. Forget Miguel.

823
01:03:47.909 --> 01:03:49.577
Well...

824
01:03:50.745 --> 01:03:52.580
as long as that's what you want.

825
01:03:53.706 --> 01:03:55.541
Me, too.
Okay.

826
01:03:56.584 --> 01:03:57.584
Deal?

827
01:03:58.961 --> 01:04:00.922
Deal. Mmm.

828
01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:09.263
"Forget Miguel"?

829
01:04:09.347 --> 01:04:11.849
Well, forget Tulio.

830
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.078
Well, is it ready yet?

831
01:04:37.917 --> 01:04:38.917
Ooh.

832
01:04:41.462 --> 01:04:44.090
Ah!

833
01:04:44.173 --> 01:04:46.467
Ah! Hmm.

834
01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:49.387
It seems to be missing something.

835
01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:53.307
Ah, that's it.

836
01:04:55.226 --> 01:04:57.979
It needs more... body.

837
01:05:23.254 --> 01:05:24.254
Ha!

838
01:05:31.262 --> 01:05:34.807
Do... as I command!

839
01:05:40.396 --> 01:05:42.440
The gods deserve a proper tribute.

840
01:05:42.732 --> 01:05:46.193
Stop! There will be no sacrifices!

841
01:05:46.444 --> 01:05:49.447
That kid does you better
than you do.

842
01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:52.283
Some send-off, huh?

843
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:56.787
We're finally at the "Go back to Spain
and live like kings" part.

844
01:06:02.668 --> 01:06:03.668
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

845
01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:09.300
Well, isn't king kind of
a step down from god?

846
01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:12.845
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

847
01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:15.389
Miguel, we can't stay here.

848
01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:17.308
We have a plan, remember?

849
01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:23.147
How about we forget the plan? Hmm?

850
01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:26.275
What?

851
01:06:33.616 --> 01:06:38.287
Now everyone will know
the truth of your "divinity."

852
01:06:56.889 --> 01:06:58.349
I'm okay!

853
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:00.601
I'm still okay!

854
01:07:00.685 --> 01:07:03.521
Come on! Get on!

855
01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:10.861
Altivo, hyah!

856
01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:16.701
Whoa!

857
01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:29.754
Tulio!

858
01:07:30.715 --> 01:07:34.593
Hey, over here,
you big Tzekel-Kan cat creep!

859
01:07:35.553 --> 01:07:37.722
Altivo, get Chel out of here.

860
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:51.651
Duck!

861
01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:02.663
Whoa!

862
01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:06.167
Whoa!

863
01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:11.087
Move! Move!

864
01:08:14.717 --> 01:08:15.717
Jump!

865
01:08:30.191 --> 01:08:31.358
Whoa!

866
01:08:34.945 --> 01:08:37.072
I know what you are...

867
01:08:38.699 --> 01:08:40.743
and I know what you are not!

868
01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:43.788
And you are not gods!

869
01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:49.460
You're not a god?

870
01:08:50.336 --> 01:08:51.712
You lied to me?

871
01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:59.595
How dare you!
Hey, it was his stupid plan!

872
01:09:00.012 --> 01:09:01.055
- What?
- Oh, oh, oh.

873
01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:04.308
My plan was that we should lie low!

874
01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:07.561
But your plan was to run off and be all

875
01:09:07.645 --> 01:09:09.980
"Oh, look at me. Look at me. I'm a god."

876
01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:10.898
That's not true!

877
01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:12.650
No? Who are you kidding?

878
01:09:12.942 --> 01:09:14.735
You're buying your own con!

879
01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:16.737
At least I'm not dating mine.

880
01:09:16.821 --> 01:09:19.615
I... Ooh, low blow.

881
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.408
Listen, Mr. High and Mighty,

882
01:09:21.492 --> 01:09:24.662
we'd both be sailing out of here
with a mountain of gold

883
01:09:24.787 --> 01:09:26.747
if you had just listened to me!

884
01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:30.501
Well, now you've got all
the precious gold and Chel.

885
01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:31.877
So what do you need me for?

886
01:09:31.961 --> 01:09:34.713
Well, maybe I don't need you anymore.

887
01:09:34.797 --> 01:09:37.883
Well, then, why don't you
just go back to Spain, and I'll stay here,

888
01:09:37.967 --> 01:09:39.927
and we'll both get what we want!

889
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.429
That's... fine with me, pal!

890
01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:43.553
- Fine with me, too!
- Ooh.

891
01:09:43.597 --> 01:09:44.682
- Fine!
- Ouch.

892
01:09:44.765 --> 01:09:46.016
Okay!

893
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:47.100
All right!

894
01:09:48.686 --> 01:09:49.686
Tie him up!

895
01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:53.106
What?

896
01:09:53.482 --> 01:09:54.984
Whoa.

897
01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:57.570
Jump!

898
01:09:57.653 --> 01:09:58.654
Whoa!

899
01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:00.697
Ah!

900
01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:10.749
No!

901
01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:42.489
My lord.

902
01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:51.373
Where did you get this?

903
01:10:57.588 --> 01:10:58.588
That was good, huh?

904
01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:22.279
Hey, a little help, please?

905
01:11:22.738 --> 01:11:25.783
Chief Tanni! Chief Tanni!

906
01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:28.744
I've decided to stay.

907
01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:31.163
Oh, this is wonderful news.

908
01:11:31.497 --> 01:11:33.749
What a glorious day for El Dorado.

909
01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:38.295
Lord Miguel has decided to live among us!

910
01:11:39.254 --> 01:11:40.255
Tulio!

911
01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.342
Is everything okay?

912
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:51.433
Everything is... fine.

913
01:13:29.364 --> 01:13:30.364
Ha!

914
01:13:39.917 --> 01:13:40.917
Ah!

915
01:13:42.586 --> 01:13:43.586
Whew!

916
01:14:03.107 --> 01:14:04.900
We'll miss you!
Thank you.

917
01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:48.068
Well, good luck.

918
01:14:48.861 --> 01:14:50.821
Yeah. You, too.

919
01:15:12.134 --> 01:15:13.927
Whoa.

920
01:15:14.011 --> 01:15:15.429
Whoa, boy, what is it?

921
01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:24.855
Cortes.

922
01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:26.231
My lord, what is it?

923
01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:28.358
Chief Tanni! Chief Tanni!

924
01:15:30.152 --> 01:15:34.114
Approaching the city
is an army of strangers.

925
01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.535
We are safe here.
They'll never find the gate to the city.

926
01:15:38.619 --> 01:15:42.873
But, sire, they are being led
by Tzekel-Kan.

927
01:15:44.625 --> 01:15:47.127
He survived! Warriors,
prepare yourselves for battle!

928
01:15:48.879 --> 01:15:51.381
Chief, you cannot fight them!

929
01:15:51.465 --> 01:15:53.258
Then how can we stop them?

930
01:15:54.092 --> 01:15:55.385
We can't.

931
01:16:02.059 --> 01:16:04.561
Hmm.

932
01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:07.397
Uh, one moment, please.

933
01:16:11.318 --> 01:16:13.737
Okay, here's the gate. Here's the boat.
Uh-huh. And?

934
01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:15.948
Here's the gate.
Okay.

935
01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:17.133
Here's the boat.
Got that. And?

936
01:16:17.157 --> 01:16:19.826
Well, here's the "goat,"
and here's the "bate." Tulio!

937
01:16:25.082 --> 01:16:27.251
That's it.

938
01:16:27.334 --> 01:16:29.002
We'll crash the boat into the pillars.

939
01:16:29.086 --> 01:16:31.838
That's it? I mean, but...

940
01:16:32.923 --> 01:16:35.008
What about the gold?
Well...

941
01:16:37.135 --> 01:16:39.263
Chief!

942
01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:40.721
Chief.

943
01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:43.015
I've got a plan.

944
01:16:54.278 --> 01:16:57.322
Hold the line steady!
They're almost in place!

945
01:17:01.994 --> 01:17:05.205
It better be there, for your sake.

946
01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:25.058
Okay, Chief!

947
01:17:26.101 --> 01:17:27.436
On my signal!

948
01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:31.481
Ready! Hit the pillars!

949
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:34.151
Now!

950
01:17:46.621 --> 01:17:47.831
They're breaking too fast!

951
01:17:47.914 --> 01:17:48.914
Tulio, the sail!

952
01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:54.504
It's stuck!

953
01:18:04.264 --> 01:18:06.808
They're not gonna make it. Altivo!

954
01:18:17.944 --> 01:18:19.946
Are you crazy?

955
01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:39.925
Get off the boat, Miguel,
or you'll never see the city again.

956
01:18:40.008 --> 01:18:43.678
I know. You don't think I'm gonna let
you have all the fun, do you?

957
01:18:45.222 --> 01:18:46.890
Come on. We've got a wave to catch.

958
01:19:11.039 --> 01:19:12.249
- Get out of the way!
- Huh?

959
01:19:15.252 --> 01:19:16.294
Hold on!

960
01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:25.261
Whoa!

961
01:19:34.604 --> 01:19:37.274
We're gonna have to hit it broadside!

962
01:19:37.566 --> 01:19:40.694
That's your plan? But the gold!

963
01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:41.777
I know!

964
01:19:42.779 --> 01:19:45.031
Just turn the boat!

965
01:19:46.241 --> 01:19:49.786
On impact, everybody jump!

966
01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:23.361
We made it.

967
01:20:23.445 --> 01:20:26.364
It worked. It worked.

968
01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:30.410
Wait. Get down!
Ouch. Ow.

969
01:20:30.911 --> 01:20:33.330
There they are.

970
01:20:52.182 --> 01:20:53.182
No.

971
01:21:01.525 --> 01:21:03.693
You lying heathen.

972
01:21:04.194 --> 01:21:05.946
There's nothing here at all.

973
01:21:06.029 --> 01:21:08.281
No. Wait. Wait.

974
01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.702
Men, seize him!

975
01:21:14.788 --> 01:21:18.542
There is no El Dorado here. Onward, men.

976
01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.220
Wait! No, wait!

977
01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:32.138
Wait!

978
01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.734
Yes!

979
01:21:44.818 --> 01:21:47.737
Now, that was an adventure.

980
01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:50.198
Yes. Yes, it was. And, um...

981
01:21:51.116 --> 01:21:56.746
it was so much gold!

982
01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:02.085
I'm fine.
Good.

983
01:22:03.253 --> 01:22:05.380
Let's go.

984
01:22:11.803 --> 01:22:13.013
Partner.

985
01:22:17.267 --> 01:22:18.267
Partner.

986
01:22:19.227 --> 01:22:21.479
Hey, guys, come on!

987
01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:23.940
You don't wanna stay here forever, do you?

988
01:22:24.274 --> 01:22:27.777
But... we don't have a map.
We don't have a plan.

989
01:22:27.861 --> 01:22:30.113
Well, that's what makes it interesting.

990
01:22:30.614 --> 01:22:31.614
You're right!

991
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:33.575
What are we waiting for?

992
01:22:33.658 --> 01:22:35.785
Let's follow that trail!

993
01:22:35.869 --> 01:22:36.870
Hyah!

994
01:22:36.953 --> 01:22:38.246
Oh!

995
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:39.873
Come on, boys!

996
01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:44.919
Hey, Altivo!

997
01:22:46.838 --> 01:22:48.173
Sit, boy! Sit!

998
01:22:48.256 --> 01:22:52.385
Chel, we're not on the horse!
