Is accused of replacing...

was not reached until yesterday.

00:26:16.512 --> 00:26:19.307
- Fingerprints?

333
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.517
Got an unidentified stiff here.

334
00:26:21.601 --> 00:26:24.604
I've circled the whorls in pen
in case the transmission's a little fuzzy.

335
00:26:24.687 --> 00:26:27.749
Listen, run it through state and federal,
and if you can, run it through Interpol.

336
00:26:27.773 --> 00:26:30.109
Will do.
Well, what's this about?

337
00:26:30.193 --> 00:26:32.695
- Oh, just a feeling I have.

338
00:26:32.778 --> 00:26:36.157
Ouch. When you get those feelings,
insurance companies start to go bankrupt.

339
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.076
Listen, the, uh, fax number is...

340
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.621
Is on the top edge
of the transmission he just got.

341
00:26:41.704 --> 00:26:44.123
Is on the top edge
of the transmission you just got.

342
00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:48.961
Oh, an airport, huh?

343
00:26:49.045 --> 00:26:51.190
Listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

344
00:26:51.214 --> 00:26:54.550
Yeah. And I'm fresh out of chlorine.

345
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.059
Just as this storm
starts breakin'.

346
00:27:03.142 --> 00:27:06.646
The satellite feed up
and drops the other shoe on us.

347
00:27:06.729 --> 00:27:08.648
Look at this new front movin' in.

348
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:10.650
Makes its baby brother
look like chickenshit.

349
00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:14.904
- Well, I can sand down all the runways...

350
00:27:14.987 --> 00:27:16.948
and keep the plows going
between landings...

351
00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:19.659
but you gotta downshift them up there,
give me time to work.

352
00:27:19.742 --> 00:27:23.246
You got it.
All right, everyone.

353
00:27:23.329 --> 00:27:26.249
Let's call all our birds
and slow ‘em down...

354
00:27:26.332 --> 00:27:28.709
before we get a parking lot
over our heads.

355
00:27:28.793 --> 00:27:31.087
The line starts
at the Mississippi...

356
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.339
and they better start
takin' numbers.

357
00:27:42.265 --> 00:27:44.183
Can I get you another?

358
00:27:45.393 --> 00:27:48.646
- No, thank you.

359
00:27:48.729 --> 00:27:51.691
I only have to look at his face for another
15 or 20 minutes.

360
00:27:53.776 --> 00:27:55.776
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

361
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.447
I've just been informed
by Dulles Traffic Control.

362
00:27:58.531 --> 00:28:00.950
That there's a weather front
moving in ahead of us.

363
00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:04.662
We may be up here
a little while longer.

364
00:28:04.745 --> 00:28:06.664
Thank you.

365
00:28:06.747 --> 00:28:08.749
On second thought...

366
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.965
- Al?

367
00:28:16.048 --> 00:28:18.134
Hey, I'm right here, partner.

368
00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:20.928
Your stiff's dossier is
coming through right now.

369
00:28:22.263 --> 00:28:24.473
- What can you tell me about him?

370
00:28:24.557 --> 00:28:27.685
- He's dead.
- You needed a computer to figure that one out?

371
00:28:27.768 --> 00:28:30.354
No, no, no, no.
You don't follow me.

372
00:28:30.438 --> 00:28:33.858
According to the Department of Defense,
he's been dead for two years.

373
00:28:33.941 --> 00:28:38.195
- What?
- That's right. “Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.

374
00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:43.617
American adviser in Honduras.
Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88.”

375
00:28:43.701 --> 00:28:46.495
- Officer?
- [ Fax Beeps I

376
00:28:46.579 --> 00:28:50.291
Read between the lines, and I'd say it
looks like a lot of black-bag stuff to me.

377
00:28:50.374 --> 00:28:52.960
Yeah, I see it.
All right, Al. Thanks a lot.

378
00:28:53.044 --> 00:28:55.296
- Hey, anytime.
- Okay.

379
00:28:57.381 --> 00:28:59.300
Say, I close in about an hour.

380
00:28:59.383 --> 00:29:01.302
Maybe we can go get a drink?

381
00:29:04.263 --> 00:29:06.932
Just the fax, ma'am.
Just the fax.

382
00:29:08.809 --> 00:29:10.954
Sam, if you're
desperate, get some airport personnel...

383
00:29:10.978 --> 00:29:12.897
- man-on-the-street stuff
- Hey, wait a second.

384
00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.107
I see somebody.
I'll call you back, okay? Hold on.

385
00:29:15.191 --> 00:29:17.777
I'll call you from London. Bye.

386
00:29:20.946 --> 00:29:22.865
The Ghost of Christmas Past.

387
00:29:22.948 --> 00:29:26.035
Nakatomi? L.A.?
You're John McClane, right?

388
00:29:26.118 --> 00:29:28.245
- Who are you?
- Sam Coleman. WNTW News.

389
00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:30.790
- Excuse me.
- Hey, come on.

390
00:29:30.873 --> 00:29:32.958
Give me a break.
I saw the stiff.

391
00:29:33.042 --> 00:29:35.461
Word is, that was your handiwork.

392
00:29:35.544 --> 00:29:38.089
No. I only do needlepoint.

393
00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:47.014
Great. National just shut down.
Totally iced.

394
00:29:47.098 --> 00:29:50.559
- They're gonna be sending us their planes.
- Happy, happy holidays.

395
00:29:50.643 --> 00:29:52.812
The worst part, Mr. Trudeau, was the press.

396
00:29:52.895 --> 00:29:55.207
Oh, they were here anyways,
crawlin' all over the Esperanza story...

397
00:29:55.231 --> 00:29:57.149
so they got it right
on the fuckin' news.

398
00:29:57.233 --> 00:29:59.151
You know, bloodstains and all.

399
00:29:59.235 --> 00:30:02.613
Personally, I'd like to lock every
damn reporter out of the airport...

400
00:30:02.696 --> 00:30:05.199
but then they'd just pull
that freedom-of-speech crap on us.

401
00:30:05.282 --> 00:30:07.201
Then the A.C.L.U.
would be all over us.

402
00:30:07.284 --> 00:30:09.203
Murder on television.

403
00:30:09.286 --> 00:30:11.372
Hell of a start
for Christmas week.

404
00:30:12.665 --> 00:30:15.084
What is it?
A gang thing like last time?

405
00:30:15.167 --> 00:30:18.003
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

406
00:30:19.422 --> 00:30:21.173
- Who the hell is this?
- Uh-uh, McClane.

407
00:30:21.257 --> 00:30:24.093
- I'm a police officer.
- In an unauthorized area.

408
00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:26.178
L.A., Mr. Trudeau,
don't mean shit.

409
00:30:26.262 --> 00:30:29.014
Yeah? That's what
I said about my last cholesterol test.

410
00:30:30.349 --> 00:30:32.726
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

411
00:30:34.186 --> 00:30:36.439
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo
has explained to you...

412
00:30:36.522 --> 00:30:38.899
the minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.

413
00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:41.694
Maybe he can explain this.

414
00:31:00.045 --> 00:31:02.840
- All systems tapped, Colonel.
- Fire it up.

415
00:31:18.063 --> 00:31:20.149
“H” minus five minutes.

416
00:31:20.232 --> 00:31:22.651
Stand by.

417
00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:26.864
All right. We've got a body in the morgue
that seems to have died twice.

418
00:31:26.947 --> 00:31:29.492
Assuming it's not a computer error,
what do we assume?

419
00:31:29.575 --> 00:31:31.911
That somebody's about
to seriously fuck with this airport.

420
00:31:31.994 --> 00:31:35.664
What the hell is that supposed to mean? I
mean, I know we're dummies up here, McClane...

421
00:31:35.748 --> 00:31:37.917
so give us a taste
of your brilliant genius.

422
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.146
- I mean, you're talkin' about a hijacking,
a robbery or what?
- Look, I'm not sure.

423
00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.549
Oh, he's not sure.
Well, 'm stunned. I gotta lie down.

424
00:31:45.633 --> 00:31:47.944
The only people that go to this
much trouble are professionals...

425
00:31:47.968 --> 00:31:50.328
- not luggage thieves and not punks.
- Professional at what?

426
00:31:50.387 --> 00:31:53.849
What the fuck do you think this is, huh?
The safety patrol here?

427
00:31:53.933 --> 00:31:55.935
This is the résumé
of a professional mercenary.

428
00:31:56.018 --> 00:31:59.873
You got the world's biggest drug dealer on his way
here. You need a slide rule to figure this out?

429
00:31:59.897 --> 00:32:02.900
Or maybe another body in a zipper bag
before you start asking questions?

430
00:32:02.983 --> 00:32:06.362
Hey, pal, you're the one that gave us
that fuckin' body. Remember that.

431
00:32:06.445 --> 00:32:08.948
Yeah, I remember that.

432
00:32:14.954 --> 00:32:17.498
Lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in.

433
00:32:17.581 --> 00:32:20.376
- Now.
- What? You're not buyin' into this?

434
00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:24.046
I want them to report anything out of the
ordinary, no matter how trivial. You got that?

435
00:32:24.129 --> 00:32:26.340
- Yeah, I got it.
- Oh, my God!

436
00:32:26.423 --> 00:32:27.675
- What?

437
00:32:27.758 --> 00:32:29.677
- The runways. Look.
- Son of a bitch!

438
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.555
- What the hell?
- They're shutting down.

439
00:32:32.638 --> 00:32:34.682
Jesus Christ.

440
00:32:39.895 --> 00:32:42.898
Go to emergency lighting now.

441
00:32:42.982 --> 00:32:45.234
Emergency. We are in a code yellow.

442
00:32:45.317 --> 00:32:48.362
- Backup systems won't come up.
- Shunt to another terminal.

443
00:32:48.445 --> 00:32:52.032
- Bobby, what do you got?
- Nothing. The whole network is down.

444
00:32:52.116 --> 00:32:53.909
Maybe we should call
the power company, huh?

445
00:32:53.993 --> 00:32:55.828
We're on the same goddamn grid,
and we're hot.

446
00:32:55.911 --> 00:32:58.080
Dulles, what's going on? I'm on approach.

447
00:32:58.163 --> 00:33:01.292
- Maintain position. Repeat.
- What's going on down there?

448
00:33:01.375 --> 00:33:04.062
- Roger. We're on it.
- Western, we're unable right now. Please delay.

449
00:33:04.086 --> 00:33:08.632
Fuji 604, execute published
missed-approach procedure and hold.

450
00:33:08.716 --> 00:33:11.760
T.W.A. 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

451
00:33:11.844 --> 00:33:14.054
Climb to and maintain
one zero thousand.

452
00:33:14.138 --> 00:33:17.308
I've checked all systems.
It ain't happenin'!

453
00:33:30.195 --> 00:33:33.091
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you. The
problem's all over the airport. No lights.

454
00:33:33.115 --> 00:33:35.784
- What's it look like?
- Approach control— it's gone.

455
00:33:35.868 --> 00:33:37.870
Jesus. Instrument
landing system is down.

456
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.291
Confirmed. I.L.S. is dead.

457
00:33:42.374 --> 00:33:45.919
Every goddamn system's dead,
and NMAC monitors are down.

458
00:33:51.717 --> 00:33:53.719
Attention all controllers. Attention.

459
00:33:53.802 --> 00:33:57.848
We have a code-red alert.
Every aircraft approaching our sector...

460
00:33:57.931 --> 00:34:00.017
who are not already
in our landing pattern...

461
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.269
gets diverted
to their alternate airport now.

462
00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:07.107
Everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern...

463
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:09.568
holds at the outer markers.

464
00:34:09.652 --> 00:34:12.946
Stack 'em, pack 'em
and rack 'em. Move.

465
00:34:13.947 --> 00:34:16.909
- Get someone on it!

466
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.997
All right. Not a word
of this leaves this room.

467
00:34:22.081 --> 00:34:24.166
There must be 15,000 people
in this airport...

468
00:34:24.249 --> 00:34:26.835
and we don't need panic
on our hands.

469
00:34:26.919 --> 00:34:28.962
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

470
00:34:29.046 --> 00:34:32.925
After that, those planes low on fuel
aren't gonna be circling.

471
00:34:33.008 --> 00:34:35.761
They're gonna be droppin'
on the White House lawn.

472
00:34:37.471 --> 00:34:40.891
McClane, this what you expected?

473
00:34:40.974 --> 00:34:42.935
No.

474
00:34:44.478 --> 00:34:46.438
This is just the beginning.

475
00:34:50.567 --> 00:34:53.696
- F.AA. hotline.
- How could they know already?

476
00:34:53.779 --> 00:34:56.865
- They can't.

477
00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.994
- Maybe it's the boys that pulled all your plugs.
- Put it on speaker.

478
00:35:02.579 --> 00:35:05.457
Attention, Dulles Tower. Attention.

479
00:35:05.541 --> 00:35:08.627
They say that blind men become
very attentive by way of compensation.

480
00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:10.629
Now that you're both
blind and deaf...

481
00:35:10.713 --> 00:35:13.757
I think I've got your attention.

482
00:35:13.841 --> 00:35:17.511
I'm aware your recorders
are active, so I'll be quick.

483
00:35:17.594 --> 00:35:19.680
You can play me back later
to your heart's content.

484
00:35:19.763 --> 00:35:22.266
How did you get on this line?
Who is this?

485
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:26.311
- Who I am is unimportant. What I want...

486
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.834
Well, if you don't want those planes
to start splashing into the Potomac...

487
00:35:30.858 --> 00:35:33.402
as they run out of fuel,
what I want is very important.

488
00:35:33.485 --> 00:35:37.030
A plane will be landing
at this airport in 58 minutes.

489
00:35:37.114 --> 00:35:40.409
It is FM-1,
Foreign Military One.

490
00:35:40.492 --> 00:35:42.286
Now, I'm sure you gentlemen
are well aware...

491
00:35:42.369 --> 00:35:44.389
- of the unique nature of this flight...
- Esperanza?

492
00:35:44.413 --> 00:35:46.874
And the importance of its cargo.

493
00:35:46.957 --> 00:35:51.253
This plane will not be met by anyone.

494
00:35:51.336 --> 00:35:53.922
It will land on a runway
of my designation...

495
00:35:54.006 --> 00:35:56.842
where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.

496
00:35:56.925 --> 00:36:01.221
That will conclude my interest in this
aircraft and your responsibility for it.

497
00:36:01.305 --> 00:36:06.435
At the same time, I want
a 747 cargo conversion...

498
00:36:06.518 --> 00:36:09.897
fully fueled and placed at my disposal.

499
00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.899
You have two more minutes
to advise...

500
00:36:11.982 --> 00:36:14.985
your inbound aircraft
to hold at their outer radio marker.

501
00:36:15.068 --> 00:36:17.946
After that, you will be
able to receive only.

502
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:22.659
Any attempt to restore your systems
will be met by severe penalties.

503
00:36:22.743 --> 00:36:26.497
- He's bluffing.
- Damn it, you can't do this.

504
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.665
I am doing this.

505
00:36:35.923 --> 00:36:39.259
Okay, you guys, listen up.
I need you to punch up a code 15.

506
00:36:39.343 --> 00:36:41.261
I got an idea,
and I need your help.

507
00:36:41.386 --> 00:36:43.764
If Esperanza gets on that plane
and makes it to a country...

508
00:36:43.847 --> 00:36:45.766
that has no extradition
treaties, we're fucked.

509
00:36:45.849 --> 00:36:49.019
They're talking to us on our own
goddamn system. They gotta be close.

510
00:36:49.102 --> 00:36:51.104
I'll have my men tear
this airport apart.

511
00:36:51.188 --> 00:36:53.106
Just in the nick of time, huh?

512
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.068
Hey, McClane, I got a first-class
unit here— SWAT team and all.

513
00:36:56.151 --> 00:36:58.213
- We don't need any
Monday-morning quarterbacks.
- Fuck Monday morning.

514
00:36:58.237 --> 00:37:00.906
My wife's on one of the goddamn planes
these guys are fucking with.

515
00:37:00.989 --> 00:37:04.743
That puts me on the playing field. If you'd
have moved your fat ass when I told you to...

516
00:37:04.827 --> 00:37:06.745
we wouldn't be hip deep
in shit right now.

517
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:08.807
- That's it. Security. You're out of here.
- Mr. Trudeau...

518
00:37:08.831 --> 00:37:11.959
Mr. Trudeau, do I have to remind you
about F.A.A. regulations...

519
00:37:12.042 --> 00:37:14.628
regarding unauthorized personnel
in the control tower?

520
00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:16.755
All we have to do is find
a way to transmit.

521
00:37:16.839 --> 00:37:19.651
Yeah, right. Somebody wanna run down
to Radio Shack and get a transmitter?

522
00:37:19.675 --> 00:37:22.678
We already have one.
The new terminal wing they're building...

523
00:37:22.761 --> 00:37:25.639
20 airlines when it's done,
all with their own reservation computers...

524
00:37:25.722 --> 00:37:27.558
all tied in to a nice
big antenna array.

525
00:37:27.641 --> 00:37:30.102
- Better see Mr. McClane out.
- Get your fuckin' hands off me!

526
00:37:30.185 --> 00:37:32.455
- You got no business being up here.
- I'm telling you guys.

527
00:37:32.479 --> 00:37:34.565
Everything we need
is over by the annex skywalk...

528
00:37:34.648 --> 00:37:37.568
- just sitting there, waiting to go on line.
- The annex skywalk?

529
00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:39.987
Goddamn it, Trudeau.
You're dealin' with pros here.

530
00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.614
You can't fuck with these people!
Listen to me!

531
00:37:42.698 --> 00:37:46.052
Sam Coleman, WNTW news. Mr. Trudeau, there
are a lot of rumors flying around here today.

532
00:37:46.076 --> 00:37:48.453
No way. No way, lady.
Hell, no. No.

533
00:37:48.537 --> 00:37:50.706
This is off limits, Coleman.
You know that.

534
00:37:50.789 --> 00:37:52.708
Get them out of here.

535
00:37:52.791 --> 00:37:54.751
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of too!

536
00:37:54.835 --> 00:37:56.753
Get your fucking hands off me.

537
00:37:56.837 --> 00:37:59.089
For shit's sake, just
get ‘em both out of here!

538
00:38:00.465 --> 00:38:03.093
Lobby Security, come in.

539
00:38:03.176 --> 00:38:05.113
- Tomlinson here.
- This is Captain Lorenzo here...

540
00:38:05.137 --> 00:38:07.217
with two unauthorized personnel
in the fucking tower.

541
00:38:07.264 --> 00:38:09.308
Now, would you
get your thumb out of your ass...

542
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:11.310
get 'em out of the elevator...

543
00:38:11.393 --> 00:38:13.830
or you're gonna find a goddamn pink slip
in your Christmas stocking.

544
00:38:13.854 --> 00:38:15.856
10-4. Let's go.

545
00:38:15.939 --> 00:38:18.567
Goddamn!

546
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.654
- Anything who can think of?
Can't fuck with what guy?
- Shit. Hang on over there.

547
00:38:22.738 --> 00:38:24.323
- What for?
- Just hang on.

548
00:38:26.408 --> 00:38:29.453
Big drug dealer on his way to prison,
gunfight at airport...

549
00:38:29.536 --> 00:38:32.056
every controller in the coffee shop
getting beeped and hauling ass...

550
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.999
and you rocking the boat.

551
00:38:34.082 --> 00:38:36.043
Connection? Come on, McClane.
Just a few words.

552
00:38:36.126 --> 00:38:38.045
Okay, just a few words.
Fuck off.

553
00:38:38.128 --> 00:38:41.340
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

554
00:38:43.008 --> 00:38:47.220
Stuart. The guy that got canned
by Congress. That's who he was.

555
00:38:47.304 --> 00:38:49.932
- Huh? Who he who? What? Hey!
- Shh!

556
00:38:50.015 --> 00:38:53.185
It's okay.
I've done this before.

557
00:39:02.986 --> 00:39:05.197
- Hey.
- Hi.

558
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.366
- Where's the other one?
- Claustrophobic, I guess.

559
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.205
It's a VHF system, but the planes
are so close it doesn't matter.

560
00:39:13.288 --> 00:39:16.833
I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,
wire in a crossover, and we're hot.

561
00:39:16.917 --> 00:39:18.835
Even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.

562
00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:21.797
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

563
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.299
I want my SWAT team
to go with him as cover.

564
00:39:24.383 --> 00:39:27.010
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of too.

565
00:39:32.432 --> 00:39:35.268
Oh, man. I can't
fuckin' believe this.

566
00:39:35.352 --> 00:39:37.980
Another basement.
Another elevator.

567
00:39:38.063 --> 00:39:40.899
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

568
00:40:02.838 --> 00:40:04.756
What the fuck?

569
00:40:39.541 --> 00:40:42.044
Who are you?

570
00:40:42.127 --> 00:40:45.839
I'm Marvin.
Marvin. I'm Marvin.

571
00:40:45.922 --> 00:40:48.592
I thought you was tryin'
to steal my records, that's all.

572
00:40:49.634 --> 00:40:52.471
I'm just the janitor.

573
00:40:58.101 --> 00:41:02.272
This is Dulles Approach
to all aircraft holding at Potomac VORTAC.

574
00:41:02.355 --> 00:41:05.192
We are experiencing
some technical problems here.

575
00:41:05.275 --> 00:41:07.295
The weather conditions,
which have been deteriorating all day...

576
00:41:07.319 --> 00:41:11.823
have now been complicated by, uh—
By an unforeseen human factor.

577
00:41:11.907 --> 00:41:15.619
This has affected all
of our electronic equipment...

578
00:41:15.702 --> 00:41:17.788
and their redundant backups
as well.

579
00:41:17.871 --> 00:41:21.583
As a result, our nav
and approach systems are down...

580
00:41:21.666 --> 00:41:24.169
and we expect to lose voice
in another minute.

581
00:41:24.252 --> 00:41:28.507
We want you to continue
holding at the outer marker as directed...

582
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.592
and wait for further instructions.

583
00:41:30.675 --> 00:41:32.719
As soon as we're back on line...

584
00:41:32.803 --> 00:41:36.014
we'll expedite your landings
on a fuel-emergency basis.

585
00:41:37.724 --> 00:41:39.726
Good luck.

586
00:41:41.103 --> 00:41:43.063
God bless.

587
00:41:48.735 --> 00:41:51.696
All right.
Change the boards.

588
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.058
Okay, stand back.

589
00:42:20.142 --> 00:42:22.727
- The skywalk annex.
- No, goddamn it. The annex skywalk.

590
00:42:22.811 --> 00:42:26.249
Listen to me. The annex skywalk. It's the
last thing I heard before they kicked me out.

591
00:42:26.273 --> 00:42:28.316
Well, let me see here now.

592
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.402
Well, this must be it
right there.

593
00:42:30.485 --> 00:42:35.240
See? That's the raised platform,
and there's the new terminal.

594
00:42:35.323 --> 00:42:38.201
There's your skywalk.

595
00:42:38.285 --> 00:42:40.245
Goddamn bottleneck.
Nice place for an ambush.

596
00:42:41.788 --> 00:42:44.875
What's the fastest way you can
get me out to that spot?

597
00:42:48.378 --> 00:42:50.797
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

598
00:42:50.881 --> 00:42:52.966
Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.
We'll watch your back.

599
00:42:53.049 --> 00:42:54.968
Yeah? Who watches yours?

600
00:43:06.938 --> 00:43:11.484
Main ventilation duct.
Main ventilation duct.

601
00:43:11.568 --> 00:43:13.486
And bingo.

602
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:18.450
Just once,
I'd like a regular, normal Christmas.

603
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:24.414
Eggnog, a fuckin'
Christmas tree...

604
00:43:24.497 --> 00:43:27.876
a little turkey.

605
00:43:27.959 --> 00:43:32.172
But no, I gotta crawl around in
this motherfucking tin can.

606
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.763
We're in the annex skywalk.
I can see the array.

607
00:43:39.846 --> 00:43:42.849
I'll give you a call for a protocol test
as soon as it's hot.

608
00:43:42.933 --> 00:43:46.686
That's all for now. Sergeant, we may
need some more equipment.

609
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:50.607
- I'd like to send one of your guys back for it.
- Right, sir. You got it.

610
00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:55.612
What the hell's goin' on?

611
00:43:55.695 --> 00:43:57.822
Hey! Put that back on!

612
00:43:59.366 --> 00:44:02.619
Hey, asshole,
what do I look like to you?

613
00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:05.121
Assitting duck.

614
00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:07.958
Take him!

615
00:44:09.584 --> 00:44:12.754
- Shit!

616
00:44:12.837 --> 00:44:15.507
Damn it.
I hate it when I'm right.

617
00:44:19.636 --> 00:44:21.638
Look out!
Get down!

618
00:44:29.646 --> 00:44:31.982
Keep your head down!

619
00:44:41.533 --> 00:44:44.327
You son of a bitch!

620
00:46:01.363 --> 00:46:04.115
Stay down!

621
00:46:16.795 --> 00:46:18.755
Fuck!

622
00:46:18.838 --> 00:46:21.257
Motherfucker!

623
00:46:27.263 --> 00:46:29.516
Come on.
Come on.

624
00:46:49.536 --> 00:46:52.288
Fucking son of a bitch!

625
00:46:58.503 --> 00:47:00.338
[ Screams I

626
00:47:08.847 --> 00:47:12.225
- Shit.
- [ Gasping I

627
00:47:15.311 --> 00:47:17.522
Fuck.

628
00:47:20.608 --> 00:47:23.653
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.

629
00:47:56.811 --> 00:47:59.898
- Geez
- You all right?

630
00:47:59.981 --> 00:48:03.902
Yeah. Yeah. But the antenna array—
I gotta get to it and set it up.

631
00:48:08.823 --> 00:48:11.075
Get down!

632
00:48:28.384 --> 00:48:31.554
Goddamn.

633
00:48:33.473 --> 00:48:36.100
Bait.

634
00:48:37.018 --> 00:48:39.979
Jerk us off...

635
00:48:40.063 --> 00:48:42.273
make Lorenzo sacrifice
his best men.

636
00:48:46.528 --> 00:48:48.571
Make you waste your time...

637
00:48:51.574 --> 00:48:53.493
Time we don't have.

638
00:49:07.966 --> 00:49:10.593
I think you're closer
than 50 yards.

639
00:49:10.677 --> 00:49:13.596
So's that airplane.
Practically.

640
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.057
Yeah. There's quite a
few of them out there.

641
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.059
It looks like
a regular traffic jam.

642
00:49:18.142 --> 00:49:20.186
There's nothing
regular about it.

643
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:24.524
See? You're intrigued.
That's my gift, Mrs. McClane.

644
00:49:24.607 --> 00:49:27.443
I notice things—
Things other people wouldn't see.

645
00:49:27.527 --> 00:49:30.405
That's how I make
people curious.

646
00:49:30.488 --> 00:49:32.323
Don't you mean nauseous?

647
00:49:32.407 --> 00:49:36.869
Look. The people have a right to know
everything about everybody.

648
00:49:36.953 --> 00:49:38.913
You got in the way of that.

649
00:49:38.997 --> 00:49:41.833
Listen, buster, you
endangered my children...

650
00:49:41.916 --> 00:49:45.461
and you didn't do it
for anything as noble as the people.

651
00:49:45.545 --> 00:49:47.463
The only time you even
see the people...

652
00:49:47.547 --> 00:49:50.341
is when you look down
to see what it is you're stepping on.

653
00:49:55.054 --> 00:49:57.140
Me? Yeah, I'll live...

654
00:49:57.223 --> 00:49:59.434
but Lorenzo's SWAT team
Is dead...

655
00:49:59.517 --> 00:50:01.436
and the antenna array is— is gone.

656
00:50:01.519 --> 00:50:05.523
- Didn't you see it?

657
00:50:05.607 --> 00:50:07.859
I'm tired of looking for a new miracle.

658
00:50:09.777 --> 00:50:11.821
Just hold a minute. No, I'll be right back.

659
00:50:11.904 --> 00:50:15.116
- Just hold for a second.
Something's going on here.

660
00:50:15.199 --> 00:50:16.993
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just hold on for a minute.

661
00:50:17.076 --> 00:50:20.246
I say again, Annex Team,
give us a sit rep.

662
00:50:21.873 --> 00:50:24.083
Annex Team, come in.
Do you copy?

663
00:50:25.627 --> 00:50:29.672
It's got some kind of scramble on it.
Can you do anything with it?

664
00:50:29.756 --> 00:50:34.927
- No. This scramble mode must
activate on this code panel.

665
00:50:35.011 --> 00:50:38.097
Even if we scan their frequency,
we can't listen in.

666
00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:40.221
- These guys are pros.
- So are you. Break the code.

667
00:50:40.266 --> 00:50:42.560
I wanna hear what these bastards
are sayin' to each other.

668
00:50:42.644 --> 00:50:45.146
This is a 10-digit control panel,
six-digit readout.

669
00:50:45.229 --> 00:50:47.815
Hell that could be
a million combinations.

670
00:50:47.899 --> 00:50:50.401
Next time you kill
one of these guys...

671
00:50:50.485 --> 00:50:53.112
- get him to enter the code first.
- Yeah.

672
00:50:55.073 --> 00:50:57.742
Sir, we just monitored a call
from their chief engineer.

673
00:50:57.825 --> 00:51:00.411
Our people took out
their SWAT team completely.

674
00:51:00.495 --> 00:51:03.414
You were right. They went for the
antenna array. We're right on schedule.

675
00:51:03.498 --> 00:51:06.459
Losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.

676
00:51:12.048 --> 00:51:13.966
Attention, Dulles Tower.

677
00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:17.220
Attention, Dulles Control Tower.

678
00:51:17.303 --> 00:51:20.765
Mr. Trudeau, I know you're listening.
Unfortunately, you're not obeying.

679
00:51:20.848 --> 00:51:22.767
Try me face-to-face, and we'll see.

680
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:24.828
You were warned not to try
to restore your systems.

681
00:51:24.852 --> 00:51:28.648
You've wasted lives and precious time
on a futile and obvious target

682
00:51:28.731 --> 00:51:31.484
Now you're gonna
pay the penalty.

683
00:51:31.567 --> 00:51:35.613
I got five dead officers down here,
Colonel Stuart. Isn't that penalty enough?

684
00:51:35.697 --> 00:51:38.449
McClane, you keep out of this.
You've been nothing but a pain...

685
00:51:40.368 --> 00:51:44.247
Oh, McClane.
John McClane.

686
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:49.585
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

687
00:51:49.669 --> 00:51:51.587
I read about you
in People magazine.

688
00:51:51.671 --> 00:51:53.840
You seemed out of your league
on Nightline, 1 thought.

689
00:51:53.923 --> 00:51:55.842
Hey, Colonel, blow me.

690
00:51:55.925 --> 00:51:59.303
How much drug money
is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?

691
00:51:59.387 --> 00:52:03.266
I think Cardinal Richelieu said it best.
“Treason is merely a matter of dates.”

692
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:07.395
This country's got to learn
that it can't keep cutting the legs off...

693
00:52:07.478 --> 00:52:09.480
of men like General Esperanza...

694
00:52:09.564 --> 00:52:13.443
men who have the guts to stand up
against communist aggression.

695
00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:16.571
And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?

696
00:52:16.654 --> 00:52:20.575
What's lesson two—
The neutron bomb?

697
00:52:20.658 --> 00:52:23.286
No. I think we can find
something in between.

698
00:52:25.913 --> 00:52:28.207
Watch this.

699
00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:32.545
Give me a flight number,
one that's low on fuel.

700
00:52:32.628 --> 00:52:34.756
Windsor 114.
Transatlantic from London.

701
00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:37.842
Fuel tank's dry as a martini.

702
00:52:37.925 --> 00:52:42.013
Activate the I.L.S. landing system,
but recalibrate sea level...

703
00:52:43.681 --> 00:52:45.725
minus 200 feet.

704
00:53:09.749 --> 00:53:11.667
Oh, Jesus!

705
00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:14.629
They've reset
ground level minus 200 feet.

706
00:53:14.712 --> 00:53:19.425
Windsor Flight 114.
This is Dulles Approach. Do you copy?

707
00:53:19.509 --> 00:53:23.638
Dulles Approach, this is Windsor 114.
Where the devil have you been?

708
00:53:23.721 --> 00:53:28.309
Windsor 114. Dulles Approach.
We've been right here all along, old buddy.

709
00:53:28.392 --> 00:53:30.895
Our systems only came back
on line just this very second.

710
00:53:30.978 --> 00:53:33.481
Windsor 114...

711
00:53:33.564 --> 00:53:37.735
you are cleared for I.L.S. approach,
runway two-niner.

712
00:53:37.819 --> 00:53:39.819
Contact Dulles Tower frequency
at the outer marker.

713
00:53:39.862 --> 00:53:42.156
Jesus Christ!
He's gonna crash the fuckin' plane!

714
00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:46.953
Roger, Approach, and about time. I've got
230 people up here flying on petrol fumes.

715
00:53:47.036 --> 00:53:51.123
- Roger, 114. Understand.
Calibrate Dulles altimeter—
- Oh, Jesus.

716
00:53:51.207 --> 00:53:54.752
- They'll fly right into the concrete.
- Son of a bitch!

717
00:53:54.836 --> 00:53:58.297
- Why are they listening to him?
- It's our frequency! Why shouldn't they?

718
00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:01.509
- Dulles, this is Windsor 114.
- Barnes!

719
00:54:01.592 --> 00:54:05.179
This is Dulles Tower.
We have radar contact.

720
00:54:05.263 --> 00:54:07.265
Give me your coat!

721
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:10.268
What are you gonna do?

722
00:54:10.351 --> 00:54:12.770
Whatever I can.

723
00:54:14.814 --> 00:54:17.024
- Ladlies and gentlemen...

724
00:54:17.108 --> 00:54:19.211
as you've probably noticed,
we've started our descent.

725
00:54:19.235 --> 00:54:21.153
We're sorry
for the inconvenience...

726
00:54:21.237 --> 00:54:23.698
- but we'll all be on the
ground in a few minutes.

727
00:54:23.781 --> 00:54:26.701
- Thank you.
- Please keep your seat belts on.

728
00:54:26.784 --> 00:54:29.263
Oh, not to worry. We've made arrangements
for your next flight...

729
00:54:29.287 --> 00:54:31.497
- SO you won't miss it, okay?
- Thank you.

730
00:54:31.581 --> 00:54:35.626
In your seat, please.
Come on. In your seat.

731
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:38.713
Oh, hey.
We're just like British Rail, love.

732
00:54:38.796 --> 00:54:42.133
We may be late, but we get you there.
Don't worry.

733
00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:59.900
Good luck, McClane!

734
00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:00.902
Good luck, McClane!

735
00:55:23.299 --> 00:55:27.553
Dulles, this is Windsor 114,
inside the outer marker.

736
00:55:27.637 --> 00:55:30.473
Roger, 114.
This is Dulles Tower.

737
00:55:30.556 --> 00:55:33.017
We have radar contact
and show you on L.L.S.

738
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.353
You're in the glide path,
and you're looking good.

739
00:55:44.654 --> 00:55:46.656
There's somebody out there!

740
00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.205
It's McClane. Christ.

741
00:55:57.917 --> 00:56:01.629
- Approach flaps.
- Approach flaps.

742
00:56:01.712 --> 00:56:04.256
Approach speed, 140.

743
00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.384
- Approach speed, 140.
- 130.

744
00:56:06.467 --> 00:56:09.804
130.
Altitude 1,000 feet.

745
00:56:09.887 --> 00:56:11.973
800, guys!
You're only at 800 feet!

746
00:56:12.056 --> 00:56:15.351
Fire and Rescue, this is Cummings.
Roll everything out to runway two-niner!

747
00:56:15.434 --> 00:56:19.981
Ref speed plus 20.600 feet.

748
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.110
Looking good, Windsor.
Now watch it.

749
00:56:24.193 --> 00:56:27.113
30-knot crosswinds,
and the runway is icy.

750
00:56:27.196 --> 00:56:29.115
Attaboy. We've got you.

751
00:56:30.408 --> 00:56:34.453
- We've got you.

752
00:56:43.129 --> 00:56:46.215
No! Pull up!

753
00:56:47.299 --> 00:56:49.260
- Jesus!
- [ Screams I

754
00:56:52.471 --> 00:56:54.557
[ All Screaming I

755
00:57:01.856 --> 00:57:05.276
- We're gonna die!
- We've got you.

756
00:57:29.175 --> 00:57:31.719
No.

757
00:57:31.802 --> 00:57:33.804
God.

758
00:57:38.267 --> 00:57:40.269
Motherfucker.

759
00:57:43.064 --> 00:57:45.066
Motherfucker.

760
00:57:47.735 --> 00:57:49.653
Oh, Jesus.

761
00:58:01.415 --> 00:58:04.251
That concludes our object lesson
for this evening.

762
00:58:04.335 --> 00:58:07.296
If the 747 we requested
is ready on time...

763
00:58:07.379 --> 00:58:10.132
and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested...

764
00:58:10.216 --> 00:58:12.718
further lessons can be avoided.

765
00:58:12.802 --> 00:58:14.720
Out.

766
00:58:14.804 --> 00:58:17.848
God.

767
00:58:38.369 --> 00:58:40.454
Come on, you guys!

768
00:58:46.168 --> 00:58:48.087
Hurry! Hurry!

769
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:50.297
We need a truck over there!

770
00:59:00.474 --> 00:59:04.228
We got no sign of survivors down here!
It's a goddamn nightmare!

771
00:59:05.771 --> 00:59:08.440
Hey, Nelson!

772
00:59:18.409 --> 00:59:20.744
Barnes!

773
00:59:20.828 --> 00:59:24.707
We've gotta warn those planes there's a lunatic
down here who likes to pretend he's the tower.

774
00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:27.293
- Get up to the cabin. Get me on the air.
- How?

775
00:59:27.376 --> 00:59:30.254
- You figure it out!
- Here's the manifest.

776
00:59:51.275 --> 00:59:53.694
McClane, I know
how you must feel.

777
00:59:58.199 --> 01:00:01.285
I wanted to help
those people tonight.

778
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:05.956
I was pretty goddamn useless.

779
01:00:08.667 --> 01:00:11.086
We called
the government for help.

780
01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:15.007
They're gonna send in
a special army unit...

781
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.301
a counterterrorist team.

782
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:28.437
Your wife's plane?
Well, they're still broadcasting...

783
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.815
even though we can't answer.

784
01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:35.986
They're gonna
run out of fuel in 90 minutes.

785
01:00:47.665 --> 01:00:51.919
Listen, Dick.
That is your name— Dick.

786
01:00:52.002 --> 01:00:54.964
If you're going to continue
to get this close...

787
01:00:55.047 --> 01:00:58.592
do you think you might consider
switching aftershaves?

788
01:00:58.676 --> 01:01:00.886
Anything else?

789
01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:04.014
Stronger mouthwash
might be nice.

790
01:01:04.098 --> 01:01:06.600
And here's Sam Coleman
reporting live from the site...

791
01:01:06.684 --> 01:01:08.644
Well, Colonel...

792
01:01:08.727 --> 01:01:11.605
they've done everything
we've anticipated... so far.

793
01:01:11.689 --> 01:01:14.525
But still there has been
no official word from authorities.

794
01:01:14.608 --> 01:01:19.029
Meanwhile, despite the fact that only one
runway has been closed due to the tragedy...

795
01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:23.409
several dozen airliners are visible from
where I stand, endlessly circling the field.

796
01:01:23.492 --> 01:01:26.036
Other reports say that
there was trouble in the tower...

797
01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.415
before the crash and that that
may have even contributed to it.

798
01:01:29.498 --> 01:01:32.084
One thing is certain—
With weather conditions worsening...

799
01:01:32.167 --> 01:01:35.587
the problem here and in the sky above us
will continue to grow.

800
01:01:35.671 --> 01:01:39.008
I'm Samantha Coleman at Dulles
International Airport.

801
01:01:46.098 --> 01:01:48.934
- Victor. Victor. Victor.
- Yeah, what's up?

802
01:01:49.018 --> 01:01:50.936
Did you pack the radio
mikes from the shoot...

803
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:53.480
- or did you put them in your carry-on?
- Are you crazy?

804
01:01:53.564 --> 01:01:56.108
- I wouldn't let those assholes check 'em in.
- I love you.

805
01:01:56.191 --> 01:01:58.736
Give me one of the receivers.

806
01:02:02.197 --> 01:02:07.119
- Can you tune in to the cockpit frequency?
- Yeah. Why?

807
01:02:07.202 --> 01:02:09.204
I wanna hear what's goin' on.

808
01:02:10.998 --> 01:02:13.417
- Should be right here on our band.

809
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.504
- Nothing.
- You just told me it would work.
Is it working or not?

810
01:02:17.588 --> 01:02:22.134
It is working, but it's— All I'm
getting is some kind of airport beacon.

811
01:02:22.217 --> 01:02:26.013
It's weird. It's like
the tower isn't there.

812
01:02:28.223 --> 01:02:30.517
Stay on it.

813
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:32.644
Let me know when
there is something there.

814
01:02:32.728 --> 01:02:34.938
Okay.

815
01:03:12.267 --> 01:03:15.104
- Major Grant. We're Blue Light.
- Rollins, Department of Justice.

816
01:03:15.187 --> 01:03:17.106
Trudeau, chief of air operations.

817
01:03:17.189 --> 01:03:19.441
Lorenzo, terminal police.

818
01:03:19.525 --> 01:03:21.443
You want something, you got it.

819
01:03:21.527 --> 01:03:24.571
This is it?
One fucking platoon?

820
01:03:24.655 --> 01:03:28.200
- One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?
- John McClane.

821
01:03:28.283 --> 01:03:32.162
- McClane, you showed some balls out there, man.
- Yeah.

822
01:03:32.246 --> 01:03:36.333
Now show some good sense.
Let the pros handle this.

823
01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:38.961
Well, it looks like the pros
are on the wrong team tonight.

824
01:03:39.044 --> 01:03:40.963
Isn't Colonel Stuart
one of your men?

825
01:03:41.046 --> 01:03:44.800
No, not anymore he's not.
Now we're here to take Colonel Stuart down.

826
01:03:44.883 --> 01:03:47.136
And we will take him down.

827
01:03:47.219 --> 01:03:50.431
You see, I served with him.
I taught him everything he knows.

828
01:03:50.514 --> 01:03:54.309
Well, maybe he's learned
a few more things since then.

829
01:03:54.393 --> 01:03:56.812
Let's hustle!

830
01:03:56.895 --> 01:04:00.107
Command post will be set up
in the airport police station.

831
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:03.110
I want to be tied in to the tower
in 15 minutes.

832
01:04:03.193 --> 01:04:05.195
Allright, let's do it!

833
01:04:06.321 --> 01:04:08.323
Hey, Trudeau.

834
01:04:10.617 --> 01:04:12.619
Things just get better or worse?

835
01:04:16.623 --> 01:04:18.542
Lights— big, portable lights.

836
01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:22.337
- We set up the field, and then—
- We wait for those lunatics to shoot 'em out?

837
01:04:22.421 --> 01:04:25.108
And where do we get those big,
portable lights— borrow them from Batman?

838
01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:27.050
What about the air phone idea?

839
01:04:27.134 --> 01:04:29.970
There's 18 planes up there.
Only five of them have those phones.

840
01:04:30.053 --> 01:04:32.431
We got through to three.
We're still trying on the others.

841
01:04:32.514 --> 01:04:35.326
That leaves 13 accidents waiting to happen.
Are they still bucking headwinds?

842
01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:38.496
I just checked the weather. Headwinds are
slamming everybody over the outer marker.

843
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.731
The planes with enough fuel
have already been...

844
01:04:40.814 --> 01:04:42.454
shunted to Atlanta,
Memphis and Nashville.

845
01:04:42.566 --> 01:04:45.027
Outer marker.

846
01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:48.947
Damn!
The outer marker!

847
01:04:49.031 --> 01:04:51.450
It's a beacon, right?
A radio beacon that sends out...

848
01:04:51.533 --> 01:04:53.845
this “beep, beep, beep”
so they know they're over it, right?

849
01:04:53.869 --> 01:04:57.247
- 50?
- So who says that radio signal has to just beep?

850
01:04:57.331 --> 01:05:01.084
Right. We switch the frequency from
the tower over to the one in the beacon.

851
01:05:01.168 --> 01:05:03.921
- We pump up the wattage.
- And we can talk to our planes...

852
01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:06.089
and those bastards
who did this will never know!

853
01:05:08.634 --> 01:05:11.637
Traced the signal.
Found it in the luggage area.

854
01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.389
They've been tapped
into your tower chatter all night.

855
01:05:14.473 --> 01:05:16.517
Punks stealin' luggage,
huh, Carmine?

856
01:05:20.145 --> 01:05:22.564
- How you doing, Telford?
- No good.

857
01:05:22.648 --> 01:05:25.067
I called Langley.
They're rigging a portable decoder.

858
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:28.070
- It'll be here in two hours.
- My wife doesn't have two hours.

859
01:05:28.153 --> 01:05:30.572
I was only transferred
to Grant's team yesterday.

860
01:05:30.656 --> 01:05:32.574
The regular guy got appendicitis.

861
01:05:32.658 --> 01:05:36.912
- Word is, nobody's better at this than Major Grant.
- Attention!

862
01:05:36.995 --> 01:05:39.623
Except maybe Colonel Stuart.

863
01:05:39.706 --> 01:05:42.876
I want to hear about the plane
those bastards asked for.

864
01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.088
Then I'll fill you in on my orders.
Pilots' briefing room. Now.

865
01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:48.090
- Keep working.
- Albertson!

866
01:05:48.173 --> 01:05:50.175
- Sir!
- With me.

867
01:05:50.259 --> 01:05:52.261
Yes, sir!

868
01:05:54.888 --> 01:05:56.974
No civilians.

869
01:06:07.568 --> 01:06:09.486
What the fuck?

870
01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:11.613
What is it?

871
01:06:11.697 --> 01:06:13.615
The outer marker beeper.

872
01:06:13.699 --> 01:06:16.326
It isn't beeping.
It's talking.

873
01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:19.079
Attention all aircraft in
Dulles landing pattern.

874
01:06:19.162 --> 01:06:21.248
This is Chief Engineer
Leslie Barnes.

875
01:06:21.331 --> 01:06:24.084
I have been authorized
to brief you in full.

876
01:06:24.167 --> 01:06:28.589
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

877
01:06:28.672 --> 01:06:31.091
Here is the situation.

878
01:06:31.174 --> 01:06:33.427
Approximately two hours ago...

879
01:06:35.721 --> 01:06:37.639
Wait till you get a load of this.

880
01:06:37.723 --> 01:06:40.434
Do not accept any instructions
claiming to be from our tower...

881
01:06:40.517 --> 01:06:43.770
unless you hear your own
flight recorder access code.

882
01:06:43.854 --> 01:06:46.940
- The terrorists have got all our systems...
- Holy shit! Get this on tape.

883
01:06:47.024 --> 01:06:49.002
And now have control of everything
except this channel.

884
01:06:49.026 --> 01:06:50.986
Give us a second here, please.

885
01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:53.614
This channel is secure,
but your own transmissions are not.

886
01:06:53.697 --> 01:06:55.616
Do not, repeat...

887
01:06:55.699 --> 01:06:59.786
do not attempt to reply on your own
frequencies to this broadcast.

888
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:01.955
These people have already
caused one crash...

889
01:07:02.039 --> 01:07:04.207
- by impersonating our tower.
- Jesus.

890
01:07:15.218 --> 01:07:17.220
Repeat. The terrorists have cut off...

891
01:07:17.304 --> 01:07:20.057
the two systems that can
allow you to land...

892
01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:22.059
Field lights for a visual landing...

893
01:07:22.142 --> 01:07:24.061
and the L.L.S. for an instrument.

894
01:07:24.144 --> 01:07:26.063
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here...

895
01:07:26.146 --> 01:07:28.440
and preparing to take out
the terrorists.

896
01:07:28.523 --> 01:07:30.859
- My God.
- Don't accept any instructions...

897
01:07:30.942 --> 01:07:33.570
- Yo, Marvin.
- Hey, you interested in a nice coat?

898
01:07:33.654 --> 01:07:36.156
No. It never looked
good on me anyway. Come here.

899
01:07:36.239 --> 01:07:39.469
Listen, you gotta get me up to the pilots'
briefing room. They're havin' a little soiree.

900
01:07:39.493 --> 01:07:42.871
I gotta hear what they're sayin' even
if I gotta put a fuckin' glass to the door.

901
01:07:42.954 --> 01:07:45.582
- Which one of these maps gets me in there?
- Don't touch it!

902
01:07:45.666 --> 01:07:49.020
- Find the map, Marvin.
- I'll find it. You'll mess up my
whole damn filing system here.

903
01:07:49.044 --> 01:07:51.922
Let's see. Pilots' briefing room.
I think that's in the main terminal.

904
01:07:52.005 --> 01:07:55.801
So would that be under
“P” for “pilots' briefing room”?

905
01:07:55.884 --> 01:07:59.846
- Now, Marvin.
- Or maybe it would be under “M”
for “miscellaneous.”

906
01:08:04.518 --> 01:08:07.270
- Oh, shit!
- This is Garber.
Request permission to reduce...

907
01:08:07.437 --> 01:08:08.980
sentry duty to 30-minute rotation.

908
01:08:09.064 --> 01:08:11.233
My men are getting cold.
They're getting antsy. Over.

909
01:08:11.316 --> 01:08:15.076
This is Colonel Stuart. Garber, please have the
men not on watch assemble for a briefing. Over.

910
01:08:15.112 --> 01:08:17.280
Roger, Colonel. Over and out.

911
01:08:17.364 --> 01:08:20.033
- What's the matter?

912
01:08:20.117 --> 01:08:25.497
Gentlemen, tonight
the pattern ends.

913
01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:29.292
The dominoes will fall no more,
and the ramparts will remain upright.

914
01:08:29.376 --> 01:08:32.796
- Sir, General Esperanza's plane
just came on the scope.

915
01:08:39.344 --> 01:08:41.346
- Tracking.
- Attention, Dulles Tower.

916
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:43.682
We will be lighting up a runway.

917
01:08:43.765 --> 01:08:47.310
Do not, repeat, do not
attempt to land any planes.

918
01:08:47.394 --> 01:08:50.313
Remember, we're monitoring you.

919
01:08:53.191 --> 01:08:56.903
- What do we do?
- Obey.

920
01:09:03.034 --> 01:09:05.620
Dulles Tower to Foxtrot Michael One.

921
01:09:05.704 --> 01:09:08.498
Dulles Tower to Foxtrot Michael One.

922
01:09:08.582 --> 01:09:11.877
This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.
We read you. Over.

923
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:17.841
Foxtrot Michael One, you are to come in
on runway 1-5, repeat, 1-5.

924
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:35.776
I found it on the floor, by the coat,
next to the luggage belt.

925
01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:37.778
What the hell you so excited
about that for?

926
01:09:37.861 --> 01:09:39.821
The code's still punched
into this one.

927
01:09:39.905 --> 01:09:43.492
You like it, huh?
How about you give me 20 bucks for it?

928
01:09:43.575 --> 01:09:45.827
How about I let you live?

929
01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.498
Man knows how to bargain.

930
01:09:49.623 --> 01:09:51.958
This is contrary to our instructions.

931
01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:54.878
We are to land at runway 1-0...

932
01:09:54.961 --> 01:09:58.799
where we are to be met
by representatives of your Justice De...

933
01:09:58.882 --> 01:10:03.345
Captain, please tell the tower
you will proceed as ordered.

934
01:10:14.314 --> 01:10:16.566
Roger, Dulles.

935
01:10:16.650 --> 01:10:19.277
Proceeding to runway 1-5.

936
01:10:35.168 --> 01:10:37.254
Foxtrot Michael One,
come in, please.

937
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.799
What are you going to do now?

938
01:10:40.882 --> 01:10:43.218
You going to shoot me?
So who will fly the plane?

939
01:10:43.301 --> 01:10:46.596
Don't worry about it.
It's not your problem.

940
01:10:53.228 --> 01:10:54.771
Michael One, do you copy?

941
01:10:58.733 --> 01:11:01.194
Foxtrot Michael One,
come in, please.

942
01:11:10.495 --> 01:11:13.290
Eagle Nest.
This is Falcon. Mayday.

943
01:11:13.373 --> 01:11:16.334
Eagle Nest. This is Falcon.
Mayday!

944
01:11:18.128 --> 01:11:23.008
- Go ahead, Falcon.
- I've lost cabin pressure. Near zero visibility.

945
01:11:23.091 --> 01:11:25.969
I must drop out of this
weather and land now...

946
01:11:26.052 --> 01:11:27.971
on the first accessible runway.

947
01:11:28.054 --> 01:11:32.350
Repeat. I've lost cabin pressure.
Near zero visibility.

948
01:11:32.434 --> 01:11:34.394
I must drop out of the storm.

949
01:11:34.477 --> 01:11:36.730
I can land, but I must land now...

950
01:11:36.813 --> 01:11:38.940
on the first outgoing runway.

951
01:11:39.024 --> 01:11:43.361
Repeat. I cannot circle
around to runway 1-5.

952
01:11:46.323 --> 01:11:48.241
I'll make you a deal, Marvin.

953
01:11:48.325 --> 01:11:50.243
You show me a shortcut
out to those runways...

954
01:11:50.327 --> 01:11:52.245
and I'll get you
a liner for that coat.

955
01:11:52.329 --> 01:11:55.540
Repeat. I cannot circle around
to runway 1-5.

956
01:11:55.624 --> 01:11:57.834
Shit.
Stand by, Falcon.

957
01:11:59.836 --> 01:12:02.547
Here, sir. He's coming in
from the ocean, sir.

958
01:12:04.841 --> 01:12:07.260
A bullet has damaged my instruments.

959
01:12:07.344 --> 01:12:09.262
I'm not sure of my bearing...

960
01:12:09.346 --> 01:12:11.723
and I must make
a visual landing immediately.

961
01:12:11.806 --> 01:12:14.643
- Do you copy, Eagle Nest?
- Roger, Falcon.

962
01:12:14.726 --> 01:12:18.772
- That would be 2-5 right, repeat, 2-5 right.
- What?

963
01:12:18.855 --> 01:12:22.108
Make up your fucking mind!

964
01:12:22.192 --> 01:12:25.153
Oh, we are just up to our ass
in terrorists again, John.

965
01:12:25.236 --> 01:12:28.198
- 2-5 left.
- Affirmative. 2-5 right. Over.

966
01:12:28.281 --> 01:12:30.659
2-5 right

967
01:12:30.742 --> 01:12:33.036
I gotta quit smoking cigarettes.

968
01:12:33.119 --> 01:12:35.330
Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.

969
01:12:35.413 --> 01:12:39.376
But if you could show it to me as well,
I would be grateful.

970
01:12:50.095 --> 01:12:52.389
I see the lights.

971
01:12:52.472 --> 01:12:55.308
They are directly in front of me.
Gracias, compadre.

972
01:12:55.392 --> 01:12:58.311
Reducing airspeed.
Approaching runway.

973
01:12:58.395 --> 01:13:01.439
- Wish me luck.
- Roger, Falcon.

974
01:13:02.565 --> 01:13:05.026
We copy. We'll have you
in five minutes.

975
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:08.238
That's right, asshole.
We'll have you in five minutes.

976
01:13:31.886 --> 01:13:35.473
I see your lights. E.T.A. 90 seconds.

977
01:13:44.399 --> 01:13:46.943
Come to papa, scumbag.

978
01:14:42.165 --> 01:14:44.751
Oh, shit!

979
01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:44.853
Freedom.

980
01:15:46.604 --> 01:15:49.732
- Not yet.
- [Gun Cocks I

981
01:15:49.816 --> 01:15:53.153
You're supposed to stay in your seat
until the plane reaches the terminal.

982
01:15:53.236 --> 01:15:55.530
No frequent-flier mileage for you.

983
01:15:55.613 --> 01:15:57.907
- Who are you?
- A cop.

984
01:15:57.991 --> 01:16:01.327
- A cop?
- Yeah, one of the good guys.
You're one of the bad guys.

985
01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:04.539
And now that I got your sorry ass,
I'm gonna trade it for my wife.

986
01:16:13.923 --> 01:16:16.259

- In there.

He went in the cockpit.

997

He took a round in his shoulder.

Plus I got one more of their guys.

1032

That's six they lost altogether.

Maybe if we knew how many they
had to start with, we could get excited...

1034
01:21:07.258 --> 01:21:10.970
but if they got 50 guys, it's a little
early to break out the champagne!

We appreciate your effort, McClane, but we
don't need a loose cannon on this deck!

1036
01:21:15.099 --> 01:21:18.269
What if they decide to crash another plane
in retaliation for your little stunt?

1037
01:21:18.352 --> 01:21:20.771
They can't do that anymore, right, Barnes?

1038

Besides, if I grabbed
Esperanza, this would all be over by now.

a little bit more creative than you think!

- You said those guys showed up
out there right away?
- Yeah.

they're on the field or close.

Come here. Let me
show you something.

1053
01:22:07.777 --> 01:22:11.781
These are the old plans when the longer
runways went in. That's— That's 12 years ago.

1054
01:22:11.864 --> 01:22:14.951
Looks like they've done
some modifications on-site...

1055
01:22:15.034 --> 01:22:18.329
Moved TRACON phones, I.L.S.,
all the underground stuff...

1056
01:22:18.412 --> 01:22:20.331
so they could handle drainage.

1057
01:22:20.414 --> 01:22:23.834
If I'm right, all of it would run right
along the airport property...

1058
01:22:23.918 --> 01:22:27.129
and go right past
this neighborhood.

1059

on the ground two hours ago!

but if you just relax a little...

1061
01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:37.515
- Come on, lady. Who you tryin' to kid?
- It's hopeless.

1062
01:22:37.598 --> 01:22:41.143
Somebody ought to get their ass
kicked for this mess. That's for sure.

1063
01:22:41.227 --> 01:22:44.855
Well, unfortunately, there really isn't
anyone we can blame for the weather.

1064
01:22:44.939 --> 01:22:47.858
Oh, yeah? What about
that porker Willard Scott?

1065
01:22:47.942 --> 01:22:49.860
I should have taken the bus.

1066
01:22:49.944 --> 01:22:53.072
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

1067
01:22:53.155 --> 01:22:56.033
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1068
01:22:56.117 --> 01:22:58.035
I was just wondering.

1069
01:22:58.119 --> 01:23:02.415
Um, this flight originally was supposed
to be five and a half hours, right?

1070
01:23:02.498 --> 01:23:06.210
- Mm-hmm.
- Do we have enough fuel to keep circling like this?

1071
01:23:06.294 --> 01:23:10.339
Oh, of course.
They anticipate little problems like this.

1072
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:30.526

and we're nowhere.

1150
01:33:52.564 --> 01:33:54.566
Body armor for the assault team.

1151
01:33:54.650 --> 01:33:57.319
Night scopes for the snipers.

1152
01:33:57.402 --> 01:34:00.030
We will take them in the hangar,
and I will pull that detonator...

1153
01:34:00.113 --> 01:34:03.659
out of Stuart's dead
fucking hand myself.

1154
01:34:03.742 --> 01:34:06.536
- Lorenzo, take all your men back to the airport.
- Sir.

1155
01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:10.207
Seal off every exit in case any of 'em
tries to slip past us...

1156
01:34:10.290 --> 01:34:13.168
- to break out onto the ground.
- You got it.

1157
01:34:14.962 --> 01:34:18.173
All right, here we go.

1158
01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:21.176
Dick, this is nuts. Every station
in town has people at the airport...

1159
01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.500
and none has heard
a whisper of this shit you're running!

1160
01:34:23.553 --> 01:34:26.181
Well, none of them is me.
You want proof? Try this.

1161
01:34:26.265 --> 01:34:29.726
Repeat. Terrorists
have murdered civilians...

1162
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:32.854
and cut off the two systems
that can allow you to land.

1163
01:34:32.938 --> 01:34:34.982
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here...

1164
01:34:35.065 --> 01:34:37.385
- and preparing to take out the terrorists.
- Jesus Christ.

1165
01:34:37.442 --> 01:34:39.486
I want you to go live now.

1166
01:34:39.569 --> 01:34:41.649
Key me in from the files—
A publicity shot, whatever.

1167
01:34:41.697 --> 01:34:43.740
Connie's got one. And a map—
Steal one from weather.

1168
01:34:43.824 --> 01:34:45.993
We're on it. We're cutting
in five minutes!

1169
01:34:46.076 --> 01:34:50.497
Tell the affiliates if they want in, they
got three minutes to shout. Let's do this.

1170
01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.166
Network, here I come.

1171
01:34:56.211 --> 01:35:00.716
Hey, Telford, what was your chickenshit
outfit doing while we were taking Grenada?

1172
01:35:03.677 --> 01:35:07.848
Grenada— five minutes
of firefight, five weeks of surfing.

1173
01:35:07.931 --> 01:35:09.975
I wish I was with you guys for that.

1174
01:35:10.058 --> 01:35:12.019
Yeah. Me too, kid.

1175
01:35:12.102 --> 01:35:15.314
- Really, sir?
- Sure.

1176
01:35:15.397 --> 01:35:18.066
Then we wouldn't
have to do this.

1177
01:35:33.457 --> 01:35:36.001
Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.

1178
01:35:36.084 --> 01:35:40.172
On schedule and in position.

1179
01:35:40.255 --> 01:35:42.549
Roger, Hatchling.
We are secure here.

1180
01:35:42.632 --> 01:35:48.430
You have a green light.
I repeat, a green light.

1181
01:35:59.149 --> 01:36:03.028
Jesus, Officer, where'd you come from,
Pearl Harbor?

1182
01:36:07.199 --> 01:36:10.577
All right, let's clear it out, please.

1183
01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:16.208
Stand by. Five, four, three...

1184
01:36:16.291 --> 01:36:19.920
This is a special bulletin from WZDC News.

1185
01:36:20.003 --> 01:36:22.506
There was a plane crash
earlier this evening at Dulles...

1186
01:36:22.589 --> 01:36:24.591
where other aircraft
continue to circle...

1187
01:36:24.674 --> 01:36:27.052
with no explanation from
airport or F.A.A. officials.

1188
01:36:27.135 --> 01:36:30.347
- Shh! Quiet!
- And now, with an exclusive WZDC report...

1189
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:32.974
here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.

1190
01:36:33.058 --> 01:36:36.061
- Can you turn it up?
- I'm one of the thousand people...

1191
01:36:36.144 --> 01:36:38.188
who has been circling
our nation's capital...

1192
01:36:38.271 --> 01:36:42.943
under the assumption that whatever problem
was going on far below was a normal one.

1193
01:36:43.026 --> 01:36:44.986
But the truth is far from normal.

1194
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:47.280
The truth is terrifying.

1195
01:36:47.364 --> 01:36:50.575
Look out!
Lady, look out!

1196
01:36:50.659 --> 01:36:53.995
Look out! Look out!
Look out! Look out! Get out of the way!

1197
01:36:54.079 --> 01:36:56.039
Ho! Get out of the way!

1198
01:36:56.123 --> 01:37:00.043
- Move! Get out of the way, lady! Go! Go! Hey! Hey!
- Look out!

1199
01:37:00.127 --> 01:37:02.045
This is a recording
of a conversation...

1200
01:37:02.129 --> 01:37:05.298
between Dulles Tower
and the captive aircraft overhead.

1201
01:37:07.592 --> 01:37:10.303
- Hey! Get out of the way!

1202
01:37:10.387 --> 01:37:14.182
- Lorenzo! Lorenzo!
- McClane, are you out of your fucking mind?

1203
01:37:14.266 --> 01:37:16.184
The Blue Light Team,
where are they?

1204
01:37:16.268 --> 01:37:18.955
Stuart's got explosives on the equipment
in the church rigged with a remote.

1205
01:37:18.979 --> 01:37:22.107
- Where's Grant?
- Grant's boys are gonna kill
that son of a bitch and get it.

1206
01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:26.194
- They're gonna get on the plane
and take off with him!
- Get the fuck out of here!

1207
01:37:26.278 --> 01:37:29.281
When the army canned Stuart, he must
have loaded that unit with his own men!

1208
01:37:29.364 --> 01:37:32.617
- Are you nuts? That firefight—
- Sideshow to jerk us off, buy 'em some time.

1209
01:37:32.701 --> 01:37:34.786
McClane, you are completely
around the fucking bend.

1210
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:36.704
- You know that?
You know what else? You're under arrest.
- You motherfucker!

1211
01:37:36.705 --> 01:37:39.705
- You know that?
You know what else? You're under arrest.
- You motherfucker!

1212
01:37:44.045 --> 01:37:46.965
Here! These are the bullets
they used out there tonight!

1213
01:37:47.048 --> 01:37:49.092
Blanks!

1214
01:37:50.552 --> 01:37:53.096
Jesus Christ.

1215
01:38:00.812 --> 01:38:02.772
This is Chief Lorenzo.

1216
01:38:02.856 --> 01:38:05.984
I want every officer recalled and assembled
in body armor and full weaponry...

1217
01:38:06.067 --> 01:38:08.278
in the motor pool
in five minutes.

1218
01:38:11.031 --> 01:38:13.408
It's time to kick ass.

1219
01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.537
Just like Iwo Jima!

1220
01:38:17.621 --> 01:38:20.832
Since then, this reporter
has learned that the terrorists...

1221
01:38:20.916 --> 01:38:22.918
have virtual control
of the entire airport...

1222
01:38:23.001 --> 01:38:26.087
A fact that the authorities
have repressed,

1223
01:38:26.171 --> 01:38:28.340
The terrorists
promise more bloodshed...

1224
01:38:28.423 --> 01:38:30.383
unless their demands are met.

1225
01:38:30.467 --> 01:38:33.970
And now that the special army commandos
have arrived at the airport...

1226
01:38:34.054 --> 01:38:38.642
the likelihood of a full-scale and
deadly battle is dangerously close.

1227
01:38:59.871 --> 01:39:02.958
That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.

1228
01:39:03.041 --> 01:39:04.960
It's all over the airport.

1229
01:39:05.043 --> 01:39:07.128
300 people have died.

1230
01:39:07.212 --> 01:39:09.714
- When are we going to land?
- I have no information.

1231
01:39:09.798 --> 01:39:13.051
And unfortunately they may not be the last.

1232
01:39:13.134 --> 01:39:15.720
The horrifying fact
is that no one is safe...

1233
01:39:15.804 --> 01:39:19.766
either in the planes above Dulles
or in the terminal below.

1234
01:39:19.849 --> 01:39:22.811
The threat of a new and higher
body count at the airport...

1235
01:39:22.894 --> 01:39:25.146
hangs over the heads of everyone...

1236
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:29.609
and the holiday season
of peace and love has become a nightmare.

1237
01:39:35.448 --> 01:39:37.367
All right, listen up!

1238
01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:41.413
All units, I want you
to converge on Hangar 11, all sides!

1239
01:39:41.496 --> 01:39:43.498
This car, McClane! Get in!

1240
01:39:43.582 --> 01:39:47.919
When the city blue show up with their
backup, they'll pick up the pieces!

1241
01:39:48.003 --> 01:39:49.963
Now, move out!

1242
01:39:50.046 --> 01:39:54.009
McClane, say hi
to my brother Vito.

1243
01:39:54.092 --> 01:39:57.262
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi.

1244
01:40:00.932 --> 01:40:03.643
Shit!

1245
01:40:03.727 --> 01:40:07.772
- Goddamn it to hell! Move that piece of shit!
- What's the matter with you?

1246
01:40:07.856 --> 01:40:09.774
I didn't even see you, man.

1247
01:40:09.858 --> 01:40:12.193
Will you move that goddamn
piece of shit out of here!

1248
01:40:12.277 --> 01:40:16.448
Vito, get the fuck out of the car and get your
ass in gear and help me, for Christ's sake!

1249
01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:20.410
Will you get—
Move that car back right now, lady!

1250
01:40:20.493 --> 01:40:23.747
- Right there. Right there. Get that.
- Hey, Coleman!

1251
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:27.917
Sam! Sam Coleman!

1252
01:40:28.001 --> 01:40:31.671
- Hey, Coleman!
- Hi!

1253
01:40:31.755 --> 01:40:34.174
Coleman!

1254
01:40:34.257 --> 01:40:37.969
But at least the truth
is not among the hostages...

1255
01:40:38.053 --> 01:40:42.974
because I, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here...

1256
01:40:43.058 --> 01:40:45.810
to put his life and talent...

1257
01:40:45.894 --> 01:40:48.772
on the line for humanity
and country.

1258
01:40:48.855 --> 01:40:50.899
And if this should be
my final broadcast...

1259
01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:57.989
Amen to that... Dick.

1260
01:40:58.073 --> 01:40:59.991
Dick? We're live, Dick.

1261
01:41:00.075 --> 01:41:04.746
Where are you now?
Dick?

1262
01:41:04.871 --> 01:41:07.582
Truck lights approaching, sir.

1263
01:41:07.666 --> 01:41:10.001
They're here, right on schedule.

1264
01:41:10.085 --> 01:41:13.963
The hangar door,
open it. Clockwork.

1265
01:41:37.987 --> 01:41:41.866
Geez, you give me this story,
and I'll have your baby.

1266
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:43.993
Not the kind of ride
I'm looking for.

1267
01:41:55.588 --> 01:41:59.008
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

1268
01:41:59.092 --> 01:42:02.345
Thank you, Major.
You're not so bad yourself.

1269
01:42:02.429 --> 01:42:04.347
Congratulations
on your escape, Sir.

1270
01:42:04.431 --> 01:42:07.976
Thank you, Major. Maybe you should
save them until we are all safe, hmm?

1271
01:42:08.059 --> 01:42:10.353
- Sir.
- My congratulations, gentlemen.

1272
01:42:10.437 --> 01:42:13.523
You've won a victory
for our way of life...

1273
01:42:13.606 --> 01:42:17.402
my pride, my admiration
and a kick-ass vacation.

1274
01:42:17.485 --> 01:42:19.654
Now get on board.

1275
01:42:49.684 --> 01:42:52.324
- What's the matter, cowboy, ride too rough?
- I don't like to fly.

1276
01:42:52.395 --> 01:42:54.981
- Then what are you doing here?
- I don't like to lose either.

1277
01:42:55.064 --> 01:42:58.276
Okay! Whoo! Here we go!

1278
01:43:06.451 --> 01:43:10.580
I don't know about you guys, but I've seen
enough fucking snow to last me a lifetime.

1279
01:43:10.663 --> 01:43:12.707
They don't get much of that
in the tropics, Major.

1280
01:43:12.791 --> 01:43:16.711
- For you, gentlemen, we'll import it.

1281
01:43:18.505 --> 01:43:21.216
Shit! They left the hangar!

1282
01:43:22.967 --> 01:43:26.346
Right there. Right there.
Get that.

1283
01:43:26.429 --> 01:43:28.807
- All right, now what?
- Get in front of them! Take it down!

1284
01:43:28.890 --> 01:43:30.850
Block their path
so they can't get out of there!

1285
01:43:30.934 --> 01:43:34.979
I'm not playing chicken with a 200-ton plane!
I'm crazy, but I ain't that crazy. Forget it.

1286
01:43:35.063 --> 01:43:36.648
Dulles, this is Northeast 140.

1287
01:43:36.731 --> 01:43:39.126
- Request clearance on first available runway.
- That's Holly's plane.

1288
01:43:39.150 --> 01:43:41.820
Repeat. Request
emergency clearance.

1289
01:43:41.903 --> 01:43:44.072
I know you're not gonna answer,
but you better listen!

1290
01:43:44.155 --> 01:43:46.157
We're down to fumes,
and we have to land...

1291
01:43:46.241 --> 01:43:48.993
and in five minutes
we're coming in one way or another.

1292
01:43:49.077 --> 01:43:51.746
Goddamn it. That's my wife's plane!
Take it fucking down!

1293
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:54.457
I'm not gettin'
in front of that plane!

1294
01:43:58.253 --> 01:44:00.797
All right, how about
getting over top of it?

1295
01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:03.591
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain. Your attention.

1296
01:44:03.675 --> 01:44:07.011
We have no choice
but to attempt an emergency landing.

1297
01:44:07.095 --> 01:44:09.514
Please fasten your seat belts
and assume crash positions...

1298
01:44:09.597 --> 01:44:12.016
as instructed by your cabin attendants.

1299
01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:14.519
Let's have the emergency checklist.

1300
01:44:14.602 --> 01:44:18.565
Attention all air traffic on this frequency
in Dulles area. This is Northeast 140.

1301
01:44:18.648 --> 01:44:21.442
We're going to attempt
an emergency landing. Be advised.

1302
01:44:23.403 --> 01:44:27.156
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1303
01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:29.993
- Just buckle your seat belt.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1304
01:44:30.076 --> 01:44:33.663
You're gonna be all right.
Lean forward now. Thank you.

1305
01:44:33.746 --> 01:44:38.126
God! Oh!

1306
01:44:40.795 --> 01:44:42.797
Oh, God.

1307
01:44:43.965 --> 01:44:48.177
Oh, God. Thy rod and
thy staff, they comfort me.

1308
01:44:54.225 --> 01:44:57.812
- Hang on! Hang on!

You wanted a story, didn't you?
Nice and easy, boys.

1310
01:45:00.064 --> 01:45:02.817
- Get me in low!
- You got it!

1311

- Where are you going?
- Bring me down!

Come back inside!

John, what the fuck are you doing
out on the wing of this plane?

There's something wrong.
The ailerons.

- I'll do him.
- This time do it right.

1323

You just get us in the air, General.
You're the only man who can do it.

1324

Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fueled.

01:47:16.743 --> 01:47:19.620
Too bad, McClane.
I kind of liked you!

- They already know.

- We had a visual
on Northeastern's landing.
- Listen.

1351
01:51:55.438 --> 01:51:59.066
They were following the fire trail in
as a guide. If they can do it, so can we!

1352
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:20.588
Whoo! Any landing you can
walk away from is a good one. That's great.
