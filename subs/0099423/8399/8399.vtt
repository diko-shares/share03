1
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,046
Towards the end
of the 17th century,

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,588
massive tin deposits
were uncovered

3
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:20,851
in the district of Kinta,

4
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:24,588
a discovery that placed
Malaya on the world map.

5
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:27,096
As a result
of this discovery,

6
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:30,498
throngs of laborers migrated
from South China.

7
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:34,095
Many were deluded by the dream
of the tin rush.

8
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:36,470
But they were treated
as slaves.

9
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,135
Living conditions
were harsh.

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,179
They worked the land
without reservations.

11
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:44,476
In the transition of time,

12
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,074
the people and land were
woven into one.

13
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,745
Though foreign yet familiar,

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,620
the enchanting land
became home to many.

15
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,849
Where's the money?

16
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:08,953
From sunrise to sunset,

17
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:11,460
this is the order
of nature.

18
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,127
Do you hear me?

19
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,901
You're gonna pay us.

20
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:23,029
We thought our destiny
was in our own hands.

21
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:24,233
I'm not asking you again.

22
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:25,900
But we were susceptible

23
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,342
to what our minds would
allow us to believe.

24
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:36,753
I want my money now!

25
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,991
You hear me?

26
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:20,060
Tin Sok fostered four
young men under his care.

27
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,099
With resilience
and persistence,

28
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:27,399
they triumphed in these
turbulent times.

29
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:32,436
Dragon-- full of integrity,

30
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,002
led by common sense,

31
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,949
feared by all
for his iron fists.

32
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:43,179
Blaze--

33
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:45,222
reserved and scheming,

34
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:48,486
an expert in the ancient
art of T'ai Chi,

35
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,857
cold, aloof,

36
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,829
a rogue.

37
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:58,164
Ace-- persistent,

38
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,499
brave for a cause,

39
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:02,630
goes all out,

40
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:05,197
fights to the bitter end.

41
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:09,678
Tiger-- impulsive,

42
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:13,012
defies conventional wisdom,

43
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,814
fast as lightning,
light as a feather.

44
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:25,686
Untold stories are abundant,

45
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,788
filled with bliss and delight,

46
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:30,629
pain and grief.

47
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,965
Each is significant
in their own right.

48
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:41,343
Life is unkind
to these miners

49
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:45,872
as they toil
the land every day,

50
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,078
despite the forces
of mother nature.

51
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:53,522
Whether rain or shine,

52
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,718
they have no one
to turn to,

53
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,852
nowhere to hide.

54
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:07,201
Day in and day out,

55
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:09,398
they toil
the abundant land.

56
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:12,874
Romance is the most beautiful
melody in life.

57
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:17,039
When sorrow looms and hope
is in despair,

58
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:20,379
this is the solace to soothe
the desolation.

59
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,419
Nice.

60
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:25,114
- All right.
- I don't like that one.

61
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,560
Exhausted by labor,

62
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:41,401
weary and worn out,

63
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:44,464
what kept them motivated?

64
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:48,308
Kept them from giving up?

65
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,143
Would their loved ones
from the homeland

66
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:54,184
be able to feel
their sorrows?

67
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,785
Would they ever
know the truth?

68
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:07,125
Please, let me introduce
my guest Mr. Yoshimura.

69
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,358
How do you do,
Mr. Yoshimura?

70
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:12,300
Mr. Yoshimura is quite
impressed with our cultural dance.

71
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:18,206
Also, I'd like you to meet
the head of our tin mine, Master Sam.

72
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:20,505
- This is Tin Sok.
- Oh, Tin Sok.

73
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:22,307
- A pleasure.
- It's an honor to meet you.

74
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,313
And who are they?

75
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,281
This is my beloved wife,

76
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,079
my lovely daughter Dan Dan

77
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:31,417
and her charming friend
Rose from Great Britain.

78
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:33,718
Please, won't you
have a seat?

79
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:38,754
The tin business has brought
you great fortune.

80
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,239
We've been
partners for years

81
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:34,004
and I'm very interested
in the tin business.

82
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:36,740
I may invest, as the potential
is limitless.

83
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,673
It's the same food
every day.

84
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:05,902
We work all the time
with no days off.

85
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,238
Yeah!

86
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:09,438
Okay, Tiger's right.

87
00:10:09,513 --> 00:10:12,277
We'll go see Tin Sok
and arrange a meeting with the boss.

88
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,408
- With Master Hoong?
- You with me?

89
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:23,387
Tin Sok,
we've never complained.

90
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,759
But lately it's been
real hard down there.

91
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,923
- The men are mad.
- They need rest.

92
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,763
We're hoping that
Master Hoong will help.

93
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:33,803
Only you can arrange it.

94
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:37,307
So will you help us?

95
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:40,502
All right, you
and Dragon can go.

96
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:43,171
Okay.
Should we go now?

97
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,942
No, not yet.

98
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:47,210
Master Hoong
is a busy man.

99
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:49,582
You'll wait
and go on the 15th,

100
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,450
the night
of the full moon.

101
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:53,285
It is the night
of good fortune.

102
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:56,326
- Both of you will wait here.
- Okay.

103
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:01,794
Master Hoong, two of the workers
from the mine are here to see you.

104
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,628
- Dragon and Tiger.
- Let them in.

105
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,600
Yes, sir.

106
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:09,568
Master Hoong
will see you now.

107
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,869
- Hello, sir.
- You're Dragon and you're Tiger?

108
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:16,276
Yes, sir, we are.

109
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,439
We have come here
in the hopes that--

110
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,951
Tell Tin Sok that he doesn't need to
worry about this matter.

111
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,647
It'll be resolved
soon enough.

112
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:26,586
You and the other men

113
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:29,626
will get all
the rest you need.

114
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:31,820
Thank you, sir.

115
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:33,362
We will leave you now.

116
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,330
You take care.

117
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:44,171
Master Hoong,
the Japanese investors

118
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,765
have agreed
to join with you.

119
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:48,004
That's a good sign.

120
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,275
So, are you interested
in joining in?

121
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:52,542
Of course.

122
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,616
ln that case, someone
will have to be replaced.

123
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,124
Well, it's the 15th,

124
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:04,922
a perfect time for a little
house-cleaning.

125
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,930
Take these vegetables.
They're set to go out.

126
00:12:11,168 --> 00:12:14,501
Oh, Tin Sok.
Tin Sok.

127
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:17,404
Okay, quiet.
Quiet.

128
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:19,942
It's the 15th of the month,

129
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,103
a truly lucky day.

130
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,204
Now just relax
and enjoy your meal.

131
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:27,375
We'll hope for good news
from Dragon and Tiger.

132
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:38,753
Go on, enjoy yourselves.
Go on, sit down.

133
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:40,490
- Right.
- Okay.

134
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,608
No one escapes.

135
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:29,638
- Run!
- Let's go.

136
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,485
Him.
Keep him here.

137
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:03,378
Never mind it.
Let's get out of here.

138
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:36,039
No, don't!

139
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,627
Save yourselves!
Get away!

140
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:47,294
What happened
at the mine?

141
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:52,766
What are you
doing here?

142
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:56,039
We were all betrayed
by the boss.

143
00:17:58,815 --> 00:18:01,045
We were ambushed too.

144
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:03,847
l don't understand.
Why did all this happen?

145
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,083
l don't know.
Hey, where's Tin Sok?

146
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:10,593
We got separated.
We looked for him.

147
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,823
Dragon was injured
in the throat.

148
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:17,162
l don't think
he can talk.

149
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:33,877
Weather is perfect today.

150
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,214
Help.
Help us.

151
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:37,913
Hey, did you
hear that?

152
00:18:37,988 --> 00:18:40,422
Hey, there's somebody
in there. Come on.

153
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,393
They're gonna need help.

154
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,021
Let's take them back
to the village.

155
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:49,292
Come on.

156
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:53,131
What happened to them?
Who are they?

157
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:15,122
Tin Sok!

158
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:18,285
Tin Sok.

159
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,852
Tin Sok.

160
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,488
Tin Sok?

161
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,296
Tin Sok?

162
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,204
Tin Sok.

163
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:37,075
- Abu.
- Yeah?

164
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:38,774
What's his condition?

165
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:40,748
l think he's gonna
be all right, Tok.

166
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:43,513
- I will.
- Don't push yourself.

167
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:45,383
Just rest.

168
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:50,257
Tin Sok?

169
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:53,262
Tin Sok.

170
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,731
They must mean
my old friend Tin Sok.

171
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,598
Abu, I want you
to take the two of them

172
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:02,263
along with you
and go find Tin Sok.

173
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,863
Leave as soon
as they're able.

174
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,239
But, Tok, I'm afraid
that might put all of us in danger.

175
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,269
Abu, just follow
my orders.

176
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:13,145
Yes, sir.

177
00:20:36,806 --> 00:20:39,934
Three months ago
we settled in here.

178
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:43,103
We worked the land
day and night

179
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,545
with hope that one day

180
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:47,947
we would be able to return
to our homeland

181
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:50,781
and make a better living
for ourselves.

182
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:55,788
Because we've shed our sweat
and our blood in this land

183
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,419
from sunup to sunset,

184
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,395
we've become part of it.

185
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:02,488
It's become our new home.

186
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:06,132
From now on we are family.

187
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:09,433
This is where we eat,
sleep and work.

188
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:12,498
This is Tin Sok.
He's the head of the mine.

189
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,600
Tin Sok!

190
00:21:14,677 --> 00:21:18,113
l want you to know
l realize your arrival here

191
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:20,240
has not been easy
for you.

192
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:22,648
Therefore I offer
some advice,

193
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:26,280
that is: follow the rules
of the mine to the letter.

194
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:29,325
The leaders will help you
if you need it.

195
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:32,156
But be forewarned,
escape is out.

196
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:35,129
Make no attempt at it.
ls that clear?

197
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:38,099
Yes, sir.

198
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:41,001
Work hard and you'll all
do really well here.

199
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,767
Someday you will
be free men.

200
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:46,604
- Dragon.
- Sir.

201
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:49,042
Dragon will give out
the work assignments.

202
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:51,205
He will teach you whatever
you need to know

203
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:54,682
for your respective jobs.

204
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,343
- Blaze.
- Sir.

205
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:58,751
Blaze will arrange
for your lodging.

206
00:21:58,822 --> 00:22:01,916
Need I remind you that work
in the mines is exhausting?

207
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:05,449
l suggest you use your rest
time to do just that.

208
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:07,996
- Ace.
- Sir.

209
00:22:08,064 --> 00:22:10,794
Ace will explain all the rules
and regulations.

210
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:12,858
It's imperative
you follow them.

211
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:16,133
lf you have any questions
at all, ask Ace.

212
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:21,305
- Tiger.
- Sir.

213
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:23,368
Take them
to get cleaned up.

214
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:27,815
From now on there is no more
fooling around here.

215
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,248
And finally, the cutting
of the braid ceremony.

216
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:39,318
It signifies
a new beginning.

217
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:42,489
It makes us aware that we
cannot return to our homeland.

218
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:44,624
Yes. Yes.

219
00:22:48,404 --> 00:22:50,964
l urge you all to embrace
this moment.

220
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,271
It is most definitely
a turning point in your life.

221
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:57,677
Yes. Yes.

222
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:15,430
Watch out. Run!

223
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:23,734
l never thought that
the 15th of the month

224
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:26,502
would bring such
a terrible nightmare.

225
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,775
- Run!
- Let's go.

226
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:10,646
Let's get out of here.

227
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:19,144
Come on.

228
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:20,985
We killed someone.

229
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:23,624
Run.

230
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,320
What really happened that day?

231
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:32,158
What will be our future?

232
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:34,499
Do we even have one?

233
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,095
Are we doomed?

234
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:42,439
l wish I could keep
the workers

235
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:44,844
who are already
on the job.

236
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:47,212
But as the business grows,

237
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:50,377
l need new blood
that I can trust

238
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:53,945
in order to complete
the expansion.

239
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:57,220
l built this business
from the beginning

240
00:25:57,293 --> 00:26:00,126
and I will not
see it fail.

241
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:03,962
l will not tolerate anyone
who may hinder the process.

242
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:08,732
l have no choice but to take
matters into my own hands.

243
00:26:13,476 --> 00:26:15,603
Master Sam
will arrive soon.

244
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:17,543
Assist him any way
you can.

245
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:19,376
Yes, Master Hoong.

246
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:22,612
My daughter Dan Dan
wishes to make a visit to the tin mine.

247
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,016
You will go with her.

248
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:25,850
Yes, Master Hoong.

249
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,899
Watch out,
hot water.

250
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:14,596
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry.

251
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,332
Don't get worked up.
He didn't mean it.

252
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:20,034
Buy I just
washed these clothes.

253
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:26,343
- It's beautiful.
- It is our culture.

254
00:27:26,415 --> 00:27:28,383
It is really
peaceful here.

255
00:27:30,353 --> 00:27:33,811
Your father owes us money
and we want it. Hear me?

256
00:27:48,104 --> 00:27:50,732
Don't think you can
hide from us.

257
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:56,541
What's happening?

258
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:01,116
You got that?

259
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:13,524
What are those men doing?

260
00:28:13,596 --> 00:28:15,086
It's nothing.

261
00:28:15,164 --> 00:28:17,223
Our mine workers
are involved.

262
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,768
It's okay.

263
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:32,337
Enough!

264
00:28:32,415 --> 00:28:34,110
Come on.

265
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:36,014
- You all right?
- Yeah.

266
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:42,222
- You disappeared.
- No I didn't.

267
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,623
We told you to stay close.

268
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,355
Well, now what?

269
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:48,897
Let's keep it going.

270
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:51,126
We'd better stop now.

271
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,259
Take off.
It's none of your business.

272
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:59,097
I'm sorry, miss.
Your father didn't intend for this.

273
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:00,836
Come on, let's go.

274
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:13,580
Over here.

275
00:29:13,656 --> 00:29:15,783
Come on,
bring it this way.

276
00:29:15,858 --> 00:29:18,418
I've got three more over here.
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in.

277
00:29:18,494 --> 00:29:21,361
Hey, bring that ore
so I can check it.

278
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,829
Right.

279
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,424
Takes you forever to get
a couple of bags of rice.

280
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:28,993
Hurry up.
Miss Dan Dan will be here soon.

281
00:29:31,307 --> 00:29:33,138
Bring in the horses.

282
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:36,878
Careful careful.

283
00:29:38,514 --> 00:29:39,981
Here it is.

284
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:41,983
You want to help me
with this?

285
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:44,952
Oh, Tin Sok.
Tin Sok. Tin Sok.

286
00:29:49,392 --> 00:29:51,223
Bring it over
here, guys.

287
00:29:51,294 --> 00:29:52,556
Let's go.
Three more.

288
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:55,961
Good job, boys.
Keep it up.

289
00:29:56,032 --> 00:29:58,500
- Miss Dan Dan.
- How are you, Tin Sok?

290
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:01,661
- He's the head of the mine, Tin Sok.
- Oh, Tin Sok.

291
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:03,500
This is Rose.
She's my friend.

292
00:30:03,572 --> 00:30:05,972
Oh, Rose.
Your friend from abroad.

293
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,840
Yeah, I was really hoping
l might show her the mine.

294
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:10,811
Wonderful.
I'll show you around.

295
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,178
Thank you.

296
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:17,208
Tried to escape again?
What did I tell you?

297
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:19,083
l warned you about
the rules of the mine.

298
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:21,316
- Stop it. What is the problem?
- He tried to escape.

299
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,224
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

300
00:30:25,294 --> 00:30:27,262
Take him away.

301
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,798
- Tin Sok.
- All right, it's all over.

302
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,662
Everyone back to work.

303
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:39,399
Tin Sok, why did those
guards beat the worker?

304
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:40,942
Oh, um...

305
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,411
we'll talk about
it later, miss.

306
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,311
Hey, look.

307
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:48,942
It's the girl
we saw earlier.

308
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:50,815
It's the boss's daughter.

309
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,979
This way.

310
00:30:53,055 --> 00:30:55,819
Now this is the kitchen.

311
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:57,791
It may seem a bit crude

312
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,590
but everyone manages
just fine.

313
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:02,426
Like a big family,
you know?

314
00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:04,557
- Dan Dan, over here.
- Huh?

315
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:06,100
Oh.

316
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:09,535
Tin Sok, what did the worker
do that he had to be beaten?

317
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:12,938
Um, the rules say
no one escapes.

318
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,943
Anyone caught
will be punished.

319
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:17,980
But we shouldn't abuse them.
Not like that.

320
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:21,483
Mmm. I'll discuss it
with your father.

321
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,212
Yes, I'll do that
as well.

322
00:31:24,286 --> 00:31:28,017
But it's really
the worker's fault.

323
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,251
They were warned
of the consequences.

324
00:31:30,326 --> 00:31:33,489
The harder they work,
the sooner they will be free.

325
00:31:47,143 --> 00:31:49,737
Huh, it's pretty
good quality.

326
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:51,905
You'd better put these
on the chart.

327
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:53,915
Right.

328
00:31:55,651 --> 00:31:58,620
So have you decided yet
how you're going to punish that kid?

329
00:31:58,687 --> 00:32:01,656
They're young
and impulsive.

330
00:32:01,724 --> 00:32:03,282
Let's give him a break.

331
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,123
Tin Sok, there are rules.

332
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:07,856
They just have to learn.

333
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,127
lf you're too easy
you'll just make it worse.

334
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
l know what they need--

335
00:32:13,836 --> 00:32:15,963
leniency.
They're just young.

336
00:32:22,344 --> 00:32:24,835
Come on.
Come on.

337
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,014
Get in there.
You deserve it.

338
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,328
How can they treat
us like animals?

339
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:45,959
They've gone too far.

340
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:50,504
What did you do?

341
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:54,065
A new guy,
he needed my help.

342
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:56,543
I'll tell Tin Sok.

343
00:33:05,354 --> 00:33:07,720
Hey, you okay?

344
00:33:11,327 --> 00:33:13,659
- What happened?
- Wake up.

345
00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:16,061
- I think he fainted.
- That's no excuse.

346
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:18,566
Back to work.

347
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:20,966
Get up.
No sleeping.

348
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:22,765
Leave him alone.

349
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:25,329
- Hey!
- Stop it!

350
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,252
Back to work.

351
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:50,898
Tin Sok.

352
00:33:50,966 --> 00:33:52,365
He overreacted.

353
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:55,301
He's sorry. He's only a kid.
Forget it.

354
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:58,636
You're too lenient.
What would I tell the boss?

355
00:33:58,707 --> 00:34:00,402
There's nothing
l can do.

356
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:03,445
He's suffered enough.
Just let it go.

357
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:05,946
Please.

358
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:09,451
What if he gives up
this week's pay?

359
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:12,487
We have to
follow the rules.

360
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:15,517
They're just kids, hmm?

361
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:18,059
We'll see
how sorry he is.

362
00:34:26,502 --> 00:34:29,232
We'll talk to Master Hoong,
ask him for a pardon.

363
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:34,474
Wait here.
I'll tell the master.

364
00:34:34,543 --> 00:34:37,068
Hmm.
Sit down.

365
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,983
Tin Sok, the master
will see you.

366
00:34:46,055 --> 00:34:48,649
Right.
Not you, Tiger.

367
00:34:48,724 --> 00:34:50,282
- Huh?
- No, you wait here.

368
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:52,384
- Oh.
- And stay out of trouble.

369
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:57,292
- Hi.
- Hmm?

370
00:34:57,366 --> 00:35:00,267
- Miss Dan Dan.
- Oh, weren't you at the mine earlier?

371
00:35:00,336 --> 00:35:02,429
Mmm, yeah.

372
00:35:02,504 --> 00:35:04,529
So what are you
doing here then?

373
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:08,373
Oh, I wish to seek a pardon
from Master Hoong.

374
00:35:08,444 --> 00:35:10,139
From my daddy?

375
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:12,510
- Daddy?
- He's my papa.

376
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:14,640
Oh yeah.
That's right.

377
00:35:14,717 --> 00:35:16,582
l violated the rules
over at the mine.

378
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:18,745
What kind of rules
were they?

379
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:21,654
Tell me.
l won't say anything.

380
00:35:21,724 --> 00:35:23,191
Really?

381
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:24,783
This guy fainted
and needed help

382
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,919
so l, um,
hit a guard.

383
00:35:26,996 --> 00:35:29,089
You attacked someone?

384
00:35:29,164 --> 00:35:32,497
l wonder why my dad
never said anything.

385
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:34,900
I'd like to know
some more details.

386
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,962
Well, you see there are rules
of the mine that need to be followed.

387
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,372
l chose not to.
I'm sorry, miss.

388
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:42,933
You don't have
to be sorry.

389
00:35:43,012 --> 00:35:46,470
Please, I don't even
know your name.

390
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:48,948
What is it?

391
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:51,043
My name is Tiger.

392
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,816
Tin Sok,
what brings you here?

393
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:55,356
There must be a reason.

394
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:57,790
The mishap at the mine.

395
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,885
l ask your pardon.

396
00:35:59,962 --> 00:36:01,190
The what?

397
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:04,357
He may have acted
without thinking,

398
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:08,062
but he is sorry
and asks your pardon.

399
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:12,005
Tin Sok,
you've always handled

400
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:14,372
these worker matters
at the mine, haven't you?

401
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:17,571
I'm thinking this problem
is up to you.

402
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:19,739
I'm concerned
about something--

403
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:23,307
the workers, you know,
and their safety.

404
00:36:23,385 --> 00:36:26,582
Tin Sok, for years now

405
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,419
you and I have handled
this business.

406
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:32,085
But times
are changing, right?

407
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:35,961
Actually, the buyers are paying
exceptionally well these days.

408
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:40,491
Huh? I mean, we wouldn't want to do
something to change that

409
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:43,094
like anger the client.
Got me?

410
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:45,902
Yes, I understand, master.

411
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:49,842
But the miners are
getting overworked, sir.

412
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,840
Tin Sok,

413
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:54,883
l wouldn't worry yourself.

414
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,612
A solution is on its way.

415
00:36:57,686 --> 00:37:00,712
ln that case, sir,
we'll wait for your good news.

416
00:37:00,789 --> 00:37:04,816
Old friend, don't ever forget that
we are family.

417
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:12,023
Hello.

418
00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:15,400
Rose, over here.

419
00:37:15,471 --> 00:37:16,995
Where is he going?

420
00:37:17,072 --> 00:37:19,063
I'll tell you later.

421
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:24,176
We only met once,

422
00:37:24,246 --> 00:37:26,180
but since then

423
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:29,809
l can't get his face
out of my mind.

424
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,714
ls it possible that
l am falling in love?

425
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:52,035
ls life at the mine
very difficult?

426
00:37:52,107 --> 00:37:53,540
Yes, it is.

427
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:55,167
But I guess
this is our fate.

428
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:57,769
We work hard in hopes
of a better life.

429
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:01,674
Things have improved
since we met Tin Sok.

430
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:15,460
No.

431
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:18,261
It can't be.

432
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,267
Don't you hear me?

433
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:22,997
Don't you know
l want you?

434
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:25,897
Why?

435
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:35,879
Stop.

436
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:40,750
- Here, drink.
- No no no.

437
00:38:40,823 --> 00:38:42,586
- No.
- Drink.

438
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:45,058
Really?

439
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:57,699
Look at this.
What's wrong with me?

440
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:01,265
I'm all wet.

441
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:18,555
l want you to have this.

442
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:20,652
It's my lucky charm.

443
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:23,994
So do you have plans
for the future?

444
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:25,590
l want to be
like Tin Sok.

445
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,464
- Tin Sok?
- Yes.

446
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:30,835
He's very kind
and dignified.

447
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:34,205
Grab him.
Get him in there.

448
00:39:34,276 --> 00:39:36,972
Get in there.

449
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:41,674
- Give me the rope.
- No, please.

450
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,877
Give it to me.

451
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:46,079
Hold still, old man.

452
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:47,883
Please!
Please!

453
00:39:47,956 --> 00:39:49,218
No.

454
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:19,184
Hey, look.

455
00:40:26,628 --> 00:40:28,596
Look, there's
another one.

456
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:34,068
There've been too many.

457
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,222
I've come to the end
of my journey.

458
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,236
My only last concern
is my daughter Ling.

459
00:41:09,304 --> 00:41:13,206
Whoever finds this,
please take care of her.

460
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:16,142
From a disgraced old man.

461
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:29,547
l know-- I know I should
not be gambling.

462
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:32,389
But I believe
it's the only way

463
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:35,157
l might be able
to help Ling.

464
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:12,596
Here.
This is for you.

465
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:51,937
I'm glad to see
you're happier now.

466
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:54,407
l have something
else for you.

467
00:42:54,476 --> 00:42:57,070
I've brought everything
I've ever saved.

468
00:42:57,145 --> 00:42:59,340
l want you to have it.

469
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,220
Just take it.
It's yours now.

470
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:19,727
l have to go, okay?

471
00:43:19,801 --> 00:43:22,827
Hey, you take care.

472
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:28,871
Be well.

473
00:43:30,245 --> 00:43:32,042
Goodbye.

474
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,793
After this day

475
00:43:50,866 --> 00:43:54,233
l don't know when or if
we will meet again.

476
00:43:57,072 --> 00:43:59,472
It seems everything
may change

477
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,372
after the night
of the 15th.

478
00:44:01,443 --> 00:44:03,934
The night of the attack.

479
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:06,503
But who is responsible?

480
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:08,014
Who?

481
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,462
No one escapes.

482
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:41,162
What did I do to deserve this?

483
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:43,261
l don't understand.

484
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:46,432
Who did this?
Who did this?

485
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:55,342
Master Hoong,
how are you?

486
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:57,817
Master Sam,
welcome.

487
00:46:57,886 --> 00:46:59,444
This way, please.

488
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:01,989
It's great to see you.
Sit.

489
00:47:02,057 --> 00:47:03,888
l have come
with a proposition.

490
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:06,427
What did you have in mind?
Have some tea.

491
00:47:06,494 --> 00:47:09,759
Well, you see,
we've been partners for years now

492
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:13,164
and I'm still considering
investing in your business.

493
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:16,060
Just one thing--

494
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:19,004
I'm concerned about this
clansman of yours,

495
00:47:19,074 --> 00:47:20,507
the one called Tin Sok.

496
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,737
Are you thinking
of taking his place?

497
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:26,906
Tin Sok, the things you
asked for are ready.

498
00:47:26,982 --> 00:47:29,143
It's late.
Get some rest.

499
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:40,056
We have a piece of jade

500
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:42,221
that represents
our brotherhood.

501
00:47:42,297 --> 00:47:43,958
Oh?

502
00:47:44,032 --> 00:47:47,866
We each have one.
It is quite fine.

503
00:47:47,936 --> 00:47:49,528
Really?

504
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:52,471
Oh, you're right.
This is superior quality.

505
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,371
Fine piece of jewelry.

506
00:47:54,442 --> 00:47:57,900
Oh, Tin Sok has men

507
00:47:57,979 --> 00:47:59,503
who are very skilled.

508
00:47:59,581 --> 00:48:01,310
Do I need to be
worried at all?

509
00:48:01,383 --> 00:48:03,351
Forest?

510
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:04,544
Yes, that's right.

511
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,280
There are four workers
from the mine.

512
00:48:06,354 --> 00:48:09,881
They are Dragon, Tiger,
Ace and Blaze, Master Hoong.

513
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:13,018
I don't get it. Why do I
have to do this every time?

514
00:48:13,094 --> 00:48:16,222
He never tells anybody else.

515
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:18,960
It's not fair.

516
00:48:19,034 --> 00:48:21,730
It's always me.
It's not fair.

517
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:30,176
He'd rather teach everybody
else other than me.

518
00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:35,544
Thought we were family.

519
00:48:37,185 --> 00:48:38,880
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

520
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:41,319
We have to wait here.

521
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,093
l don't understand
him sometimes.

522
00:48:46,161 --> 00:48:47,890
Yeah, he's always
been this way.

523
00:48:47,962 --> 00:48:49,896
Quit being so nosey,
both of you.

524
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:52,023
You're right.

525
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,534
Hey, I wonder what
we're gonna learn today.

526
00:48:57,005 --> 00:49:00,634
Aside from Tin Sok and l,
there was Shao who passed away.

527
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:02,835
- Oh?
- It was the three of us.

528
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:04,776
We started
this thing together

529
00:49:04,846 --> 00:49:07,508
- Hmm.
- Everything I've made

530
00:49:07,582 --> 00:49:10,244
- I owe to the two of them.
- Mmm.

531
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:13,412
- As I recall, Shao had a son.
- Oh?

532
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:14,955
Uh, Sand?

533
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:17,583
Yes, right.
He had a son.

534
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,251
He's now one
of Tin Sok's men.

535
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:21,124
He goes by
the name of Blaze.

536
00:49:21,196 --> 00:49:23,096
He's a very skilled fighter.

537
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:36,008
- Longevity and good health.
- Which clan?

538
00:49:36,077 --> 00:49:38,773
- Honor and peace.
- How many rings?

539
00:49:38,847 --> 00:49:41,077
- Four rings.
- Oh, Tin Sok's man.

540
00:49:41,149 --> 00:49:43,617
- Yes.
- You can go in.

541
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,164
What is the secret
behind this box?

542
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:02,102
Why is there jade in here?

543
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,229
What is Tin Sok's secret?

544
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:05,704
Blaze, huh?

545
00:50:05,773 --> 00:50:08,037
Yes, he was raised
by Tin Sok.

546
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:10,976
Oh.

547
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:13,843
It's possible this
could be of use.

548
00:50:13,915 --> 00:50:15,815
May I borrow it from you
for a little while?

549
00:50:15,884 --> 00:50:17,784
Certainly, go ahead.

550
00:50:17,852 --> 00:50:20,184
Also, since I'm new here

551
00:50:20,255 --> 00:50:22,223
and haven't hired any men,

552
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,589
l was wondering if you might have
a few men of your own to spare.

553
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:28,628
Of course.

554
00:50:28,696 --> 00:50:30,755
Forest and Sand
are at your service.

555
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:32,800
Great.
Thank you.

556
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:34,698
Oh, before I forget,

557
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:36,760
l have a present for you.

558
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,430
The Dragon Lord
Triad emblem.

559
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:41,139
Thank you.

560
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:53,186
Master Hoong, I've--

561
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:55,745
I've never questioned
your orders.

562
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:58,621
He wants us to go
and execute

563
00:50:58,693 --> 00:51:01,184
all of the workers, sir.

564
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:03,662
It can't be right
to just--

565
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:06,097
Forest, Master Sam,

566
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:08,431
he knows what he's doing.

567
00:51:08,503 --> 00:51:10,869
Carry out his orders.

568
00:51:34,862 --> 00:51:38,354
Whoever defies me
will die.

569
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:45,163
After we waited,

570
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,902
Tin Sok finally got to meet
with Master Hoong.

571
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:53,372
Hopefully Dragon
and I will be able

572
00:51:53,448 --> 00:51:55,712
to bring back good news
to the others.

573
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:57,944
After the 15th

574
00:51:58,019 --> 00:52:00,317
our lives will have
a new beginning

575
00:52:00,388 --> 00:52:03,653
and I can leave this way
of living behind.

576
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:06,717
What is the secret of the jade?

577
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:09,024
I've got to find out.

578
00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:15,099
Will the 15th bring
good fortune to us all?

579
00:52:15,169 --> 00:52:17,501
Will it be the dawn
of a new day?

580
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:20,166
- This is damak.
- Mak?

581
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:22,641
- No, damak.
- Oh.

582
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,372
Now listen,
it may look harmless,

583
00:52:25,446 --> 00:52:28,677
however looks
are deceiving.

584
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,741
It's really quite lethal.

585
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:32,308
Lethal?

586
00:52:32,387 --> 00:52:33,911
- Yes.
- Oh.

587
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:36,980
You both must learn
how to master damak.

588
00:52:37,058 --> 00:52:39,322
Never let your enemies
intimidate you.

589
00:52:39,394 --> 00:52:42,227
Hmm?
Watch me.

590
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:54,305
l have underestimated
these boys.

591
00:53:00,882 --> 00:53:03,077
Oh, I'm glad
you're both back.

592
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:05,642
All right, tell me
what's the situation?

593
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,085
We have failed.

594
00:53:07,155 --> 00:53:09,146
The warehouse burned
to the ground.

595
00:53:09,223 --> 00:53:11,521
And the assassins failed
with the other two.

596
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:15,050
All right, look,
l think Tin Sok is still alive

597
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:17,188
and his men will
surely look for him.

598
00:53:17,265 --> 00:53:20,200
Go spread the word.
l want them dead.

599
00:53:20,268 --> 00:53:22,361
l don't care what
has to be done.

600
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:25,099
Right. Master Hoong is
looking for you.

601
00:53:25,173 --> 00:53:27,266
Yes, okay fine.
Now go.

602
00:53:27,342 --> 00:53:29,572
Keep Blaze alive.

603
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:31,202
He's useful.

604
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:33,645
Give him this. He'll understand
and know where to find me.

605
00:53:33,715 --> 00:53:35,945
- Yes, sir.
- Go on now. Go go.

606
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,947
And fortunately
l have another plan.

607
00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:53,190
We have to look for Tin Sok.

608
00:53:53,267 --> 00:53:56,634
The best place to start
is searching all his favorite places.

609
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:17,453
- I'll go this way.
- Mm-hmm. Okay.

610
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:21,017
- I'll check here, okay?
- Right.

611
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:35,605
Where could he be?

612
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,005
Anybody here?

613
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:44,246
Somebody here?

614
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:48,785
Tin Sok?

615
00:54:48,856 --> 00:54:51,689
Tin Sok?
Tin Sok.

616
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:54,927
Tin Sok.

617
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:56,657
Are you Tin Sok?

618
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:59,427
Yes I am.

619
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,162
I'm Abu,
Tok Mat's friend.

620
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:05,501
Let me help you.
Be careful, Tin Sok.

621
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:08,435
Tok Mat?

622
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:10,374
Yes, I will
take you to him.

623
00:55:10,445 --> 00:55:12,003
Who's Tok Mat?

624
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:16,439
- You mean the village head?
- Yes, that's right.

625
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:18,849
Come on, I'll take you
to a safer place.

626
00:55:27,428 --> 00:55:30,488
Tok, I have found Tin Sok.

627
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,326
Hurry, Tok.

628
00:55:35,403 --> 00:55:37,769
Tok!

629
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,364
Oh, bring him in, Abu.
Over here.

630
00:55:40,441 --> 00:55:43,171
Tin Sok?

631
00:55:43,244 --> 00:55:45,542
Yes.

632
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:48,912
Tok, the two who went
searching with me,

633
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:51,918
I've lost track of them.

634
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:53,453
Never mind.

635
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,148
We'll wait till daybreak.

636
00:55:55,223 --> 00:55:58,317
lf they're not back then,
we'll send a party.

637
00:55:58,392 --> 00:55:59,950
Yes, Tok.

638
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:02,825
How are all my boys?

639
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:05,730
Don't worry.
They are safe.

640
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:11,968
Except there was one
who was injured.

641
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:15,537
He cannot speak.

642
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:19,908
- Abu, let Tin Sok rest.
- Yes.

643
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:21,812
Come on, let's go.

644
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,819
Master Hoong,

645
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:33,156
try our latest commodity.

646
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:36,390
It's an excellent crop.

647
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:40,195
Ah, before long
we'll start selling it.

648
00:56:40,268 --> 00:56:42,896
Then we'll be rich,
won't we?

649
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:48,107
This weasel will stop
at nothing

650
00:56:48,175 --> 00:56:50,370
for a profit.

651
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:56,014
I'm in good hands.
You've done quite well.

652
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:59,746
l told you that we make
a perfect team, didn't l?

653
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:06,722
But business at the parlor
is rather slow.

654
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:16,594
Don't worry.
I've come up with a great plan.

655
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,806
Listen, you're looking for
a new person to head the mine.

656
00:57:22,877 --> 00:57:25,937
We'll arrange a contest
to fill the position.

657
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:27,742
But we'll know the winner.

658
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:36,087
What a sly old fish.

659
00:57:39,594 --> 00:57:41,653
It's too peaceful here,

660
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:45,096
as if something terrible
is about to happen.

661
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:47,634
Don't think
like that, dear.

662
00:57:47,702 --> 00:57:50,034
Aunty Cheung, haven't you
noticed lately

663
00:57:50,104 --> 00:57:51,696
that Father's work

664
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:54,297
and his business partners
are somewhat suspicious?

665
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,774
l never doubt him.

666
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:57,743
He has a reason
for what he does.

667
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:02,511
Aunty Cheung,
l was wondering

668
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,278
about your marriage
to my dad.

669
00:58:04,352 --> 00:58:06,377
Was it
an arranged marriage?

670
00:58:06,454 --> 00:58:09,014
That's right.
That's the way it's always been.

671
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:12,890
It's a tradition that's been passed down
through the ages.

672
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,224
ln the long run
it has served us well.

673
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:17,696
But they're strangers,
aren't they?

674
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:19,960
Yes, that may be
the case, dear.

675
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:22,969
But relationships grow,
like your father's and mine.

676
00:58:23,037 --> 00:58:25,198
What about me?

677
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:26,967
What if I were to marry?

678
00:58:27,041 --> 00:58:30,169
I'm sure your father
will arrange a marriage to someone

679
00:58:30,244 --> 00:58:32,678
of equal status
to yours.

680
00:58:32,747 --> 00:58:35,045
You see, Dan Dan,

681
00:58:35,116 --> 00:58:38,711
women should just let
a man do as he will.

682
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:42,552
Like when your mama
was still alive

683
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:44,784
she'd let your dad
do as he needed,

684
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,850
just as I will.

685
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:48,952
We are to stand
at his side.

686
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,794
Your father needs you

687
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:53,834
to stand at his side.

688
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:58,935
l just thought that destiny
was in our hands.

689
00:58:59,006 --> 00:59:02,772
You know, Mom said
that she always thought

690
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:05,437
Tin Sok and Dad
were just alike.

691
00:59:05,513 --> 00:59:07,811
l thought things
were great.

692
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:09,873
Then suddenly,

693
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,851
Tin Sok's missing
and his men are gone.

694
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:17,051
Now they're looking for
a successor for Tin Sok.

695
00:59:17,124 --> 00:59:19,718
And someone else
is missing.

696
00:59:19,794 --> 00:59:22,262
Who are you talking
about, Dan Dan?

697
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:24,092
No one.

698
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:29,432
Tiger, where are you?

699
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:31,368
Should I wait?

700
00:59:31,439 --> 00:59:33,771
Or try and forget you?

701
00:59:35,743 --> 00:59:39,440
These honest and hardworking
poor souls,

702
00:59:39,513 --> 00:59:42,676
do they have any idea

703
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,344
what the future
holds for them?

704
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:33,889
Huh?

705
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:48,272
You, mind your own business.

706
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:32,292
Give the kid a chance.

707
01:01:34,295 --> 01:01:36,593
You'd better get going.

708
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:57,310
Come on, let's go
get that guy.

709
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:59,682
Never mind him.
Go after Ace.

710
01:01:59,753 --> 01:02:01,721
I'll look for Blaze.
Go on.

711
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:14,200
Where are they?
We even found Tin Sok.

712
01:02:14,268 --> 01:02:16,293
Why aren't they back?

713
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:18,133
l don't get it.

714
01:02:21,442 --> 01:02:24,070
Shall we look for them?

715
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,348
It's Ace!

716
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:30,747
Run! They're after us!

717
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:32,251
Let's get him inside.

718
01:02:37,691 --> 01:02:39,124
Force them out.

719
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:40,820
Let's go. Come on.

720
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:45,856
This way.
Careful, Dragon.

721
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,662
It's a trap!

722
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:28,967
Here.

723
01:05:14,314 --> 01:05:16,179
What's the secret

724
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,616
behind this second jade?

725
01:05:18,685 --> 01:05:21,745
Could it be that Tin Sok
killed my father?

726
01:05:21,822 --> 01:05:24,757
This jade is the link
to your father's death

727
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:26,520
that you've been
looking for.

728
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:29,426
The bearer of this jade,
the one responsible,

729
01:05:29,496 --> 01:05:32,294
is Tin Sok.
Master Sam.

730
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,258
We hereby announce

731
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:37,428
that to restore
the leadership in the tin mine

732
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:40,564
a contest for head
of the mine will be held.

733
01:05:40,641 --> 01:05:43,007
It is open to any
qualified fighter

734
01:05:43,077 --> 01:05:45,102
to challenge
for the position.

735
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:47,943
It will be held on the night
of good fortune,

736
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:50,347
the 15th of the month.

737
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:52,977
l want to thank you, Tok,

738
01:05:53,053 --> 01:05:55,351
for saving
all of our lives.

739
01:05:55,422 --> 01:05:59,017
Don't mention it.
We're friends, right?

740
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:01,960
You stay as long
as you like.

741
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:05,556
No one can come here,
not without my permission.

742
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:09,966
Anyway, we should be getting our things
together and leaving soon.

743
01:06:10,037 --> 01:06:13,700
l don't want to involve you
or the villagers any longer.

744
01:06:13,774 --> 01:06:17,301
As long as I'm here
no one can bring us harm.

745
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:19,902
Come on, how about we
go enjoy a good meal?

746
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,743
Thank you very much.

747
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:41,124
l owe my life
to Abu for certain.

748
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:43,431
He's the one
who brought me here.

749
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:46,098
We'll have time to heal.

750
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:48,937
Tok Mat said it's safe.

751
01:06:51,111 --> 01:06:53,079
We've suffered some setbacks

752
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:56,048
but now we can regroup
and form a plan.

753
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:21,827
Okay, ready.

754
01:08:45,692 --> 01:08:47,523
Again!

755
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,786
On the night of the 15th
we will claim justice.

756
01:09:59,032 --> 01:10:01,023
ls it because he killed
my father

757
01:10:01,101 --> 01:10:03,934
that Tin Sok
never entrusted me

758
01:10:04,004 --> 01:10:07,235
with the responsibilities
of the others?

759
01:10:07,307 --> 01:10:10,299
Why does he put
the blame on me?

760
01:10:10,377 --> 01:10:13,403
l have to know.

761
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:15,710
l have to know the answers.

762
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:19,410
Dragon, thanks
for meeting me.

763
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:21,420
l have to talk to you.

764
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:24,457
It's Ace
and his addiction.

765
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:27,493
I've known about it

766
01:10:27,561 --> 01:10:29,722
from the very beginning.

767
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:34,230
Every day
he goes gambling.

768
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:36,667
Mmm.

769
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:38,898
l just thought
you should know.

770
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,071
There's a reason,
you know.

771
01:10:42,142 --> 01:10:43,973
But I can't tell you
what it is right now.

772
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:45,909
Let's meet again
tomorrow

773
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:48,140
near the lake.

774
01:10:48,215 --> 01:10:50,308
You'll learn the entire
truth then.

775
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:53,581
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

776
01:10:53,653 --> 01:10:55,280
Tomorrow then.

777
01:10:56,823 --> 01:10:59,587
ls Ace really gambling
that much?

778
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:01,786
And what about Blaze?

779
01:11:01,862 --> 01:11:04,194
Do I think
l can trust him?

780
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:27,503
I'm sorry, Dragon.

781
01:12:27,581 --> 01:12:29,481
Don't blame me.

782
01:12:29,549 --> 01:12:33,076
l only wanted
justice served.

783
01:12:33,153 --> 01:12:35,348
Who murdered my father?

784
01:12:35,422 --> 01:12:37,151
Who was it?

785
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:41,894
Since you're here,

786
01:12:41,962 --> 01:12:45,921
and by your tone I take it
that you've read the letter,

787
01:12:45,999 --> 01:12:49,366
and the truth lies in
this little piece of jade.

788
01:12:50,637 --> 01:12:53,731
So in the days to come,

789
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:56,503
I've arranged for you
to take over the mine.

790
01:12:56,576 --> 01:13:00,171
But Dragon,
your brother,

791
01:13:00,247 --> 01:13:03,705
will try to see that
you don't succeed.

792
01:13:06,286 --> 01:13:08,618
But there's a way
to stop that.

793
01:13:08,688 --> 01:13:12,385
Dragon Lord Triad
will show you

794
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:15,394
all you need to know
to help you to lure him.

795
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:17,362
Pretty easy, huh?

796
01:13:19,599 --> 01:13:21,032
Well?

797
01:13:21,101 --> 01:13:23,433
Huh?

798
01:13:23,503 --> 01:13:25,994
Grab ahold
of this opportunity,

799
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:28,040
or pass it by.

800
01:13:35,882 --> 01:13:39,079
Then I will pass you the symbol
of the Dragon Lord today.

801
01:13:39,152 --> 01:13:41,985
l will avenge
my father's death.

802
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:52,291
I'm meeting Blaze by the lake.

803
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:55,391
It's something regarding Ace.
Dragon.

804
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:04,636
Why? Why?

805
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:07,942
Why would you betray us?

806
01:14:08,014 --> 01:14:10,505
l thought
we were brothers.

807
01:14:14,554 --> 01:14:16,613
After the night of the 15th,

808
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:19,318
the night
of good fortune...

809
01:14:20,393 --> 01:14:23,089
there will be
no going back.

810
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:29,601
l never would have guessed

811
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:32,297
that Blaze would react
like his father.

812
01:14:32,372 --> 01:14:35,102
But I truly believe

813
01:14:35,175 --> 01:14:37,666
that Dragon
will go with us

814
01:14:37,744 --> 01:14:40,144
into the arena.

815
01:14:40,213 --> 01:14:42,113
His spirit will be there.

816
01:14:50,056 --> 01:14:52,388
Today justice will be ours.

817
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:56,193
We will avenge you, Dragon.

818
01:14:58,264 --> 01:15:00,698
Dragon...

819
01:15:00,767 --> 01:15:03,827
we will make sure
your death had a reason.

820
01:15:03,903 --> 01:15:06,667
The arena
will be our witness.

821
01:15:08,775 --> 01:15:11,471
We will claim our justice!

822
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,157
Greetings, my friend.

823
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:31,697
This is Master Hoong.

824
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:33,062
Master Hoong.

825
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:34,998
This is Master Sam.

826
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:36,695
Master Sam.

827
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:40,262
Master Sam,
this is very well set up.

828
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,069
Yes, and it's
very lucrative.

829
01:15:42,142 --> 01:15:45,339
Look at the size
of the turnout today.

830
01:15:45,412 --> 01:15:47,437
Can I have your attention?

831
01:15:47,514 --> 01:15:50,005
We are here today
thanks to Master Hoong.

832
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:52,517
lsn't this a grand arena?

833
01:15:52,585 --> 01:15:55,645
We are here today
to elect a new leader.

834
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:58,691
The strongest challenger
shall win.

835
01:15:58,758 --> 01:16:01,852
Everybody who thinks
they're worthy can enter.

836
01:16:01,928 --> 01:16:03,896
And in the end,

837
01:16:03,963 --> 01:16:06,591
the last man standing here

838
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:09,658
is our new leader.

839
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,099
lntroducing...

840
01:16:13,173 --> 01:16:16,165
Blaze Blaze Blaze...

841
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,447
Master Hoong,

842
01:16:29,522 --> 01:16:31,615
this is the young man
who is going to win.

843
01:16:35,328 --> 01:16:38,491
He'd better win.
You arranged for it, right?

844
01:16:38,565 --> 01:16:41,693
Yes, no need to worry.
He will win.

845
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,904
Tin Sok, Tiger and Ace.

846
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:03,322
And you,
I'm disappointed in you.

847
01:17:03,389 --> 01:17:05,357
Ace.

848
01:17:10,096 --> 01:17:12,155
You're not worthy
of this place.

849
01:17:18,304 --> 01:17:21,205
You are a man
without a heart.

850
01:17:23,176 --> 01:17:26,737
I'm not the one
without a heart.

851
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,884
Let's see who it is, hmm?

852
01:17:53,206 --> 01:17:54,867
Ace, get up.

853
01:18:30,777 --> 01:18:32,506
How could you?

854
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:34,809
Tell me how.
Go on!

855
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:39,111
We were all brothers!

856
01:18:39,185 --> 01:18:41,779
Or so I thought.

857
01:18:43,756 --> 01:18:46,247
ls that right?
You thought wrong.

858
01:18:46,326 --> 01:18:47,884
l never thought of any
of us as brothers.

859
01:18:53,099 --> 01:18:55,067
Now let's see
who walks out.

860
01:19:41,648 --> 01:19:43,878
Justice is on our side.

861
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:47,181
We'll see who is
the supreme fighter.

862
01:19:47,253 --> 01:19:50,017
This match was fought
to a draw.

863
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:52,956
Now the arena is open

864
01:19:53,026 --> 01:19:55,153
to the next challenger.

865
01:21:18,277 --> 01:21:21,576
Tiger, you can do it.

866
01:22:48,868 --> 01:22:51,098
Victory must be mine.

867
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:53,798
He's more skilled
than I thought.

868
01:22:53,873 --> 01:22:57,434
Tiger!
You've got to stand.

869
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:30,534
ln the year 1884,

870
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:32,601
Malaya is considered

871
01:23:32,678 --> 01:23:34,771
the largest tin exporter
in the world.

872
01:23:36,415 --> 01:23:38,906
Yet accounts of what
happened in 1881

873
01:23:38,985 --> 01:23:42,352
are destined to repeat
themselves.

874
01:23:43,923 --> 01:23:46,016
Imbalance of the powerful

875
01:23:46,092 --> 01:23:47,923
and struggles
of the deprived

876
01:23:47,994 --> 01:23:50,861
linger on in uncertainty.

877
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:54,127
ls it that time
creates heroes?

878
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,363
Or are heroes created
out of time?
