I have to be at work in 20 minutes.

1452
01:39:45.105 --> 01:39:48.150
What’s up?

1453
01:39:48.233 --> 01:39:51.195
Well, I just—

1454
01:39:51.278 --> 01:39:54.406
I wanted to say
that you were right about everything.

1455
01:39:55.532 --> 01:39:57.659
That...

1456
01:39:57.743 --> 01:40:00.454
I turned my back on my friends
and my family...

1457
01:40:00.537 --> 01:40:02.498
and everything I believed in...

1458
01:40:02.581 --> 01:40:05.626
and— and for what?

1459
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:10.631
For shoes and shirts
and jackets and belts.

1460
01:40:10.714 --> 01:40:12.883
Nate.

1461
01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:18.138
I’m sorry.

1462
01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:28.482
I—
[CLEARS THROAT]

1463
01:40:28.565 --> 01:40:30.734
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.

1464
01:40:30.817 --> 01:40:33.445
I interviewed at the Oak Room.

1465
01:40:33.529 --> 01:40:35.989
And?

1466
01:40:37.282 --> 01:40:40.035
And you’re looking
at their new sous-chef.

1467
01:40:40.118 --> 01:40:43.997
- I’m moving up there in a couple weeks.
- That’s great. Congratulations.

1468
01:40:49.419 --> 01:40:52.881
I don’t know what I’m gonna do without
those late-night grilled cheeses, but—

1469
01:40:52.965 --> 01:40:57.052
I’m pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.

1470
01:40:57.135 --> 01:40:59.429
<i>May even have Jarlsberg.</i>

1471
01:41:02.599 --> 01:41:04.935
We might be able
to figure something out.

1472
01:41:07.062 --> 01:41:08.981
You think?

1473
01:41:09.064 --> 01:41:10.983
Yeah.

1474
01:41:17.864 --> 01:41:21.410
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?

1475
01:41:21.493 --> 01:41:24.871
Actually, I, uh—
I have a job interview today.

1476
01:41:24.955 --> 01:41:27.416
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1477
01:41:27.499 --> 01:41:29.751
That’s what you’re wearing?

1478
01:41:29.835 --> 01:41:32.838
Shut up. I like this.

1479
01:41:36.925 --> 01:41:38.844
- Andy, Greg Hill.
- Hello.

1480
01:41:38.927 --> 01:41:41.346
Come on. These clips are excellent.

1481
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:44.349
This thing on the janitors’ union,
that’s exactly what we do here.

1482
01:41:44.433 --> 01:41:47.436
<i>My only question is,</i> Runway?

1483
01:41:47.519 --> 01:41:50.147
You were there for less than a year.

1484
01:41:50.230 --> 01:41:52.232
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

1485
01:41:53.525 --> 01:41:55.527
Learned a lot.

1486
01:41:57.362 --> 01:42:02.409
In the end though,
I kind of screwed it up.

1487
01:42:02.492 --> 01:42:05.996
I called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl.

1488
01:42:06.079 --> 01:42:09.666
<i>Next thing you know, I got a fax</i>
<i>from Miranda Priestly herself...</i>

1489
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:12.294
saying that of all the assistants
she’s ever had...

1490
01:42:12.377 --> 01:42:14.630
you were, by far,
her biggest disappointment.

1491
01:42:14.713 --> 01:42:19.926
<i>And, if I don’t hire you,</i>
<i>I am an idiot.</i>

1492
01:42:22.429 --> 01:42:25.057
You must have done something right.

1493
01:42:52.834 --> 01:42:55.921
- [BEEPING]
<i>- [PHONE RINGING]</i>

1494
01:42:57.047 --> 01:42:58.965
Miranda Priestly’s office.

1495
01:42:59.049 --> 01:43:04.262
Hey, Emily, it’s Andy. Don’t hang up.
I have a favor to ask you.

1496
01:43:04.346 --> 01:43:07.140
You have a favor to ask of me?

1497
01:43:07.224 --> 01:43:10.519
Yeah. The thing is,
I have all these clothes from Paris...

1498
01:43:10.602 --> 01:43:12.646
and I don’t have anyplace
to wear them...

1499
01:43:12.729 --> 01:43:16.900
so I was wondering if you
could take them off my hands.

1500
01:43:21.154 --> 01:43:25.200
Well, I don’t know.
It’s a huge imposition.

1501
01:43:25.283 --> 01:43:29.496
And I’ll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they’ll drown me.

1502
01:43:29.579 --> 01:43:34.042
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

1503
01:43:34.126 --> 01:43:38.797
Thanks, Em. I appreciate it.
Good luck.

1504
01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:51.727
You have some very large shoes to fill.

1505
01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:55.313
I hope you know that.

1506
01:44:00.694 --> 01:44:04.197
I don’t understand
why it is so challenging...

1507
01:44:04.281 --> 01:44:07.909
to get my car when I ask for it.

1508
01:44:48.867 --> 01:44:50.827
[CHUCKLES]

1509
01:44:53.246 --> 01:44:55.290
Go.
