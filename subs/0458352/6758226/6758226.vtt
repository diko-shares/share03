(bell dings)

51
00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:42.639
Hi. Uh, I have an appointment
with Emily Charlton?

52
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.267
-Andrea Sachs?
-Yes.

53
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.687
Great. Human Resources certainly
has an odd sense of humor.

54
00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.939
Follow me.

55
00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:56.194
Okay, so I was Miranda's
second assistant,

56
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.405
but her first assistant recently got
promoted, and so now I'm the first.

57
00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.824
-Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
-Well, I am trying.

58
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.285
Miranda sacked the last two girls
after only a few weeks.

59
00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:06.704
We need to find someone who can
survive here. Do you understand?

60
00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.873
Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?

61
00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:12.252
Oh, my God. I will pretend
you did not just ask me that.

62
00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:15.672
She's the editor in chief of<i> Runway,</i>
not to mention a legend.

63
00:04:15.713 --> 00:04:19.300
You work a year for her, and you can
get a job at any magazine you want.

64
00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:21.761
A million girls would kill for this job.

65
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:24.639
It sounds like a great opportunity.
I'd love to be considered.

66
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.933
(giggling)

67
00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:30.520
Andrea,<i> Runway</i> is a fashion magazine,

68
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:33.690
so an interest in fashion is crucial.

69
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.150
What makes you think
I'm not interested in fashion?

70
00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:39.904
-(cell phone ringing)
-Oh, my God.

71
00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.198
No! No! No!

72
00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:44.492
What's wrong?

73
00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.333
She's on her way.
Tell everyone!

74
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.003
She's not supposed to be here until 9:00.

75
00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:58.006
Her driver just text messaged,
and her facialist ruptured a disk.

76
00:04:58.047 --> 00:05:01.384
-God, these people!
-(whistles, whispers) Who's that?

77
00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.261
That I can't even talk about.

78
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.307
All right, everyone! Gird your loins!

79
00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:11.102
-(excited chattering)
-Did someone eat an onion bagel?

80
00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.150
(exhales, sniffs)

81
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.326
(bell dings)

82
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.290
Sorry, Miranda.

83
00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.712
(bell dings)

84
00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.596
Move it! Ooh!

85
00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.849
I don't understand why it's so difficult
to confirm an appointment.

86
00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.811
I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.

87
00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:37.105
Details of your incompetence
do not interest me.

88
00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:39.023
Tell Simone I'm not going
to approve that girl

89
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.067
that she sent me
for the Brazilian layout.

90
00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:44.737
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.
She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.

91
00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.781
And RSVP yes
to the Michael Kors party.

92
00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.952
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30
and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.

93
00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:52.912
-(whispers) 9:45 sharp.
-Call Natalie at Glorious Foods,

94
00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.915
tell her no for the 40th time.
No, I don't want dacquoise.

95
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.167
I want tortes filled
with warm rhubarb compote.

96
00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.877
Then call my ex-husband and remind him

97
00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.838
the parent-teacher conference
is at Dalton tonight.

98
00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.590
Then call my husband,
ask him to meet me for dinner

99
00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.426
at that place I went to with Massimo.

100
00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:08.845
Also, tell Richard I saw
the pictures that he sent

101
00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.055
for that feature
on the female paratroopers,

102
00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:13.099
and they're all so deeply unattractive.

103
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:16.394
Is it impossible to find a lovely,
slender female paratrooper?

104
00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.521
-No.
-Am I reaching for the stars here?

105
00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.858
Not really.
Also, I need to see all the things

106
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.777
that Nigel has pulled
for Gwyneth's second cover try.

107
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.156
I wonder if she's lost any
of that weight yet. Who's that?

108
00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:31.951
Nobody. Um, uh--
Human Resources sent her up

109
00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.912
about the new assistant job,
and I was preinterviewing her.

110
00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:38.040
But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for it.

111
00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:40.877
Clearly I'm going to have to do that
myself because the last two you sent me

112
00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:43.921
were completely inadequate.
So send her in.

113
00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.549
That's all.

114
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.759
Right.

115
00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.724
-She wants to see you.
-Oh! She does?

116
00:07:54.765 --> 00:07:56.142
Move!

117
00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:03.441
-This is foul. Don't let her see it. Go!
-That's--

118
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.401
(sighs)

119
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.492
Who are you?

120
00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:15.119
Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.

121
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.289
I recently graduated
from Northwestern University.

122
00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.083
And what are you doing here?
(clears throat)

123
00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:25.671
Well, I think I could do a good job
as your assistant.

124
00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:27.423
And, um--

125
00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:33.346
Yeah, I came to New York to be a
journalist and sent letters out everywhere

126
00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:35.848
and then finally got a call
from Elias-Clarke

127
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.518
and met with Sherry
up at Human Resources.

128
00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:42.021
Basically, it's this or<i> Auto Universe.</i>

129
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:46.442
-So you don't read<i> Runway?</i>
-Uh, no.

130
00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:49.862
And before today,
you had never heard of me.

131
00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:52.156
No.

132
00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:55.368
And you have no style
or sense of fashion.

133
00:08:56.369 --> 00:09:00.331
Well, um, I think that
depends on what you're--

134
00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.834
No, no.
That wasn't a question.

135
00:09:05.836 --> 00:09:10.258
Um, I was editor in chief
of the<i> Daily Northwestern.</i>

136
00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:14.887
I also, um, won a national competition
for college journalists

137
00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.639
with my series on the Janitors' Union,

138
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.558
-which exposed the exploitation of--
-That's all.

139
00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.689
(scoffs)

140
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.442
Yeah. You know, okay.

141
00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:30.528
You're right. I don't fit in here.

142
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.823
I am not skinny or glamorous,

143
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:36.033
and I don't know that much
about fashion.

144
00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.786
But I'm smart.

145
00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.871
I learn fast and I will work very hard.

146
00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.499
I got the exclusive
on the Cavalli for Gwyneth,

147
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:47.003
but the problem is, with that huge
feathered headdress that she's wearing,

148
00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:49.672
she looks like she's working
the main stage at the Golden Nugget.

149
00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:52.466
Thank you for your time.

150
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.387
Who is that sad, little person?

151
00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.557
Are we doing a before-and-after piece
I don't know about?

152
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.189
Brown and Law, please?
Thank you.

153
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.903
-Andrea.
-Hmm?

154
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.826
Wait. You got a job
at a fashion magazine?

155
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:20.995
-Mm-hmm.
-What was it, a phone interview?

156
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.540
-WOMAN: Wow.
-Ow! Don't be a jerk.

157
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.793
Miranda Priestly is famous
for being unpredictable.

158
00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:30.838
Okay, Doug. How is it
that you know who she is and I didn't?

159
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.424
-I'm actually a girl.
-Oh!

160
00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.010
-That would explain so much.
-DOUG: Look, seriously.

161
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.678
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal.

162
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.680
I bet a million girls
would kill for that job.

163
00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:42.642
Yeah, great.
The thing is I'm not one of them.

164
00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:45.186
WOMAN: Look, you gotta
start somewhere, right?

165
00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:47.188
I mean, look at this dump
Nate works in.

166
00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:50.107
I mean, come on.
Paper napkins? Hello.

167
00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:53.819
Yeah. And Lily, she works
at that gallery doing, uh, you know--

168
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:57.073
Oh, I'm sorry.
What exactly is it that you do anyway?

169
00:10:57.114 --> 00:11:00.451
Well, lucky for me,
I already have my dream job.

170
00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:04.246
(with Lily) You're a corporate
research analyst!

171
00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:07.083
-Oh, you're right. My job sucks.
-No!

172
00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:09.001
-It sucks. I don't-- It's boring.
-It's all right. Breathe.

173
00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.170
-I'm trying.
-Here. Take a drink.

174
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:12.797
-I will have a drink.
-Ah, yes.

175
00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.758
I'd like to propose a toast.
To jobs that pay the rent.

176
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.886
-To jobs that pay the rent.
-Jobs that pay the rent.

177
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.224
Oh, baby. You should see
the way these girls at<i> Runway</i> dress.

178
00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:25.643
I don't have a thing to wear to work.

179
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.728
Come on. You're gonna be
answering phones and getting coffee.

180
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.438
You need a ball gown for that?

181
00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:31.899
I think I might.

182
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.153
Well, I happen to think
you look great always.

183
00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:39.156
Aww! I think you're full of it.

184
00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.616
(giggling)

185
00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:44.120
-Hey. Come on. Let's go home.
-Yeah.

186
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.873
I can think of something we can do
that doesn't require any clothing.

187
00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:49.291
-Really?
-Mmm.

188
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:52.294
<i>(up-tempo music playing)</i>

189
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:55.923

<i>-♪ I haven't got much time to waste ♪</i>

190
00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.718
<i>-♪ It's time to make my way ♪</i>
-Hello?

191
00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:01.262
Andrea, Miranda decided to kill
the autumn jacket story for September,

192
00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:03.931
and she is pulling up
the Sedona shoot from October.

193
00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.225
You need to come
into the office right this second

194
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.977
<i>and pick up her coffee order on the way.</i>

195
00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:10.438
-Now?
<i>-Now, get a pen and write this down.</i>

196
00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:14.191
I want one no-foam skimmed latte
with an extra shot

197
00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:16.402
and three drip coffees
with room for milk.

198
00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:19.447

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:30.666
<i>-♪ I'm ready to jump ♪</i>
-Shoot! Oh!

203
00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.673
Is there some reason
that my coffee isn't here?

204
00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:39.717
Has she died or something?

205
00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.969
No. (whispers) God.

206
00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:49.435
Oh. Bloody time.

207
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:53.063
I hope you know that this
is a very difficult job...

208
00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.607
-Mm-hm.
-...for which you are totally wrong.

209
00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:57.318
And if you mess up,
my head is on the chopping block.

210
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.154
Now, hang that up.
Don't just fling it anywhere.

211
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.001
Okay. First of all,
you and I answer the phones.

212
00:13:14.043 --> 00:13:17.213
The phone must be answered
every single time it rings.

213
00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:20.341
Calls roll to voice mail,
and she gets very upset.

214
00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.718
If I'm not here--
Andrea, Andrea--

215
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.970
you are chained to that desk.

216
00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:28.349
-Well, what if I need to--
-What? No.

217
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.017
One time an assistant left the desk

218
00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.228
because she sliced her hand open
with a letter opener,

219
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:34.396
and Miranda missed Lagerfeld...

220
00:13:34.438 --> 00:13:37.733
just before he boarded
a 17-hour flight to Australia.

221
00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.610
She now works at<i> TV Guide.</i>

222
00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:45.324
-Man the desk at all times. Got it.
-(phone rings)

223
00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.786
-Uh--
-Miranda Priestly's office.

224
00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.038
No, she's not available.

225
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.873
-Who is it?
-(mouthing words)

226
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:59.088
Yes, I will tell her
you called... yet again.

227
00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:00.381
(bell chimes)

228
00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:02.716
Right, remember,
you and I have totally different jobs.

229
00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:05.511
I mean, you get coffee--
(scoffs) and you run errands.

230
00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:09.223
Yet I am in charge of her schedule,
her appointments and her expenses.

231
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:12.476
And, um, most importantly, um,

232
00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:15.020
I get to go with her to Paris
for Fashion Week in the fall.

233
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.482
I get to wear couture.
I go to all the shows and all the parties.

234
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:21.151
I meet all of the designers. It's divine.

235
00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:24.196
Okay. Now, stay here.

236
00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:26.448
I'm going to the art department
to give them the Book.

237
00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:30.119
-The--
-This is the Book.

238
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:33.914
Now, it is a mock-up of everything

239
00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.666
-in the current issue.
-Mm-hm.

240
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.626
And we deliver it to Miranda's
apartment every night,

241
00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:39.962
and she retu-- Don't touch it.
She returns it to us

242
00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.089
in the morning with her notes.

243
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:45.301
Now, the second assistant
is supposed to do this,

244
00:14:45.342 --> 00:14:49.263
but Miranda is very private and she does
not like strangers in her house.

245
00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:52.057
So until she decides
that you are not a total psycho,

246
00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:54.810
I get the lovely task
of waiting around for the Book.

247
00:14:56.103 --> 00:14:58.397
-(phone rings)
-Oh, Emily? What do I do--

248
00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.983
-Deal with it.
-(rings)

249
00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:03.485
(sighs)

250
00:15:03.527 --> 00:15:05.404
(rings)

251
00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.489
Hello. Mrs. Priestly's office.

252
00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:11.368
Hmm. That's what I meant.
Miranda Priestly's office.

253
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.662
(groans)

254
00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:16.624
Um, you know, she is in a meeting.
Can I please take a message?

255
00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.209
Uh-huh.

256
00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:23.714
Okay. Can you please
spell Gabbana?

257
00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:26.133
-(line clicks)
-Hello?

258
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.428
I guess not.

259
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.097
I guessed an eight and a half.

260
00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:37.561
Um, uh, that's very nice of you,
but I don't think I need these.

261
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.230
Miranda hired me.
She knows what I look like.

262
00:15:40.272 --> 00:15:42.816
-Do you?
-(chuckles)

263
00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:47.655
Emily.

264
00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:48.989
Emily?

265
00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:51.742
She means you.

266
00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:59.291
-MAN: We just cut on the bias.
-MIRANDA: That's not what I asked you.

267
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:01.335
I couldn't have been clearer.
There you are, Emily.

268
00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:03.045
How many times do I have
to scream your name?

269
00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.463
Actually, it's Andy.

270
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.010
My name is Andy.
Andrea, but, uh, everybody calls me Andy.

271
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:16.976
(chuckles) I need 10 or 15 skirts
from Calvin Klein.

272
00:16:17.017 --> 00:16:18.560
What kind of skirts do you--

273
00:16:18.602 --> 00:16:21.522
Please bore someone else
with your questions.

274
00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:25.275
And make sure we have Pier 59
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

275
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.820
Remind Jocelyn I need
to see a few of those satchels

276
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:29.154
that Marc is doing in the pony.

277
00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:32.533
And then tell Simone I'll take Jackie
if Maggie isn't available.

278
00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:36.453
-Did Demarchelier confirm?
-D-Did D-Demarchel--

279
00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:39.540
Demarchelier. Did he--
Get him on the phone.

280
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:41.375
Uh, o-- okay.

281
00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:46.547
-And, Emily?
-Yes?

282
00:16:57.933 --> 00:16:59.184
That's all.

283
00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:02.938
It's just the cavalier disregard
for clear directions--

284
00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.609
(chattering continues)

285
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.489
Do you have Demarchelier?

286
00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.491
Uh, Demarchelier.

287
00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:17.161
-(groans) Leave it.
-Do you have--

288
00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.999
I have Miranda Priestly calling.

289
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:23.459
I have Patrick!

290
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:29.715
Uh, no, she called me in there
and-and then she asked me about Pier 59.

291
00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:33.677
And there was something
about Simone, Frankie, someone else.

292
00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.972
And, um, she needs skirts
from Calvin Klein.

293
00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:40.684
And, uh, there was
something about a pony.

294
00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.145
-Did she say which skirts?
-No. No.

295
00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:44.646
Did she say what kind?
Color, shape, fabric?

296
00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:48.025
-I tried to ask her.
-You may never ask Miranda anything.

297
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:52.237
Right. I will deal with all of this,
and you will go to Calvin Klein.

298
00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:54.823
Eh-- Me?

299
00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.409
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have some prior commitment?

300
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:00.037
Some hideous skirt convention
you have to go to?

301
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.705
Uh--

302
00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:16.303
-(cell phone rings)
-Miranda?

303
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.055
<i>-Are you there?</i>
-I'm about to walk in.

304
00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.474
-I'll call you as soon as--
-(line clicks)

305
00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:23.811
-(cell phone rings)
-(horn honks)

306
00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:25.312
-Hello? Hi.
<i>-EMILY: While you're out,</i>

307
00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:29.566
<i>Miranda needs you to go to Hermès</i>
<i>to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.</i>

308
00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.568
-Okay.
<i>-Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton.</i>

309
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.113
Pick that up. Oh, yeah,
and Miranda went out to meet with Meisel,

310
00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:36.240
and she will want more
Starbucks when she gets back.

311
00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:38.617
-Hot Starbucks.
-Can you just repeat that first--

312
00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.410
-(dial tone hums)
-Hello?

313
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.083
Oh, my God.

314
00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.545
What took you so long?
I have to pee!

315
00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:51.338
What? You haven't peed since I left?

316
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.258
No, I haven't. I've been manning the desk,
haven't I? I'm bursting.

317
00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:01.682
Oh, hi.

318
00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:04.852
-(snaps fingers)
-You do coat. Do the coat!

319
00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:07.020
Okay.

320
00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:09.731
Now, be prepared.
The run-through is at 12:30.

321
00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:13.193
And people are panicking, so the phone
is going to be ringing off the hook.

322
00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.987
The ru--
The run-through. Right.

323
00:19:15.028 --> 00:19:18.407
Yes. Editors bring in options
for the shoot, and Miranda chooses.

324
00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:21.160
She chooses every single
thing in every single issue.

325
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:22.536
Run-throughs are a huge deal.

326
00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.288
I don't know why you don't
know that, Andrea.

327
00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.207
-WOMAN: Okay. Are you ready?
-EMILY: Oh, hi, hi.

328
00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:29.459
Right. Well, after the loo,
Serena and I are going to lunch.

329
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.962
-This is her-- the new me.
-Hi.

330
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:34.256
-Told you.
-I thought you were kidding.

331
00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:35.799
No, quite serious, yeah.

332
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:38.051
I get 20 minutes for lunch,
and you get 15.

333
00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:40.387
-When I come back, you can go.
-Okay.

334
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.848
SERENA: What exactly is she wearing?

335
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.975
EMILY (giggling):
Her grandmother's skirt.

336
00:19:55.819 --> 00:19:58.155
Hmm. Corn chowder.

337
00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.574
That's an interesting choice.

338
00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:04.494
You do know that cellulite is one of
the main ingredients in corn chowder.

339
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.336
So none of the girls here eat anything?

340
00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:16.381
Not since two became the new four
and zero became the new two.

341
00:20:16.423 --> 00:20:20.469
-Well, I'm a six.
-Which is the new 14.

342
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:27.059
-Oh. Shoot.
-Oh, never mind.

343
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.937
I'm sure you have plenty more
polyblend where that came from.

344
00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:34.566
-(cash register clicking)
-Okay. You think my clothes are hideous.

345
00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:38.695
I get it. But, you know,
I'm not going to be in fashion forever,

346
00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:41.281
so I don't see the point of
changing everything about myself

347
00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:42.699
just because I have this job.

348
00:20:42.741 --> 00:20:45.285
Yes, that's true.
That's really what this

349
00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:48.622
multibillion-dollar industry
is all about anyway, isn't it?

350
00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:52.376
-Inner beauty.
-(cell phone rings)

351
00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:53.877
Hello.

352
00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:57.214
Right. Come on.

353
00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.882
Miranda's pushed the
run-through up a half an hour.

354
00:20:58.924 --> 00:20:59.967
Mmm!

355
00:21:00.008 --> 00:21:02.427
-She's always 15 minutes early.
-Which means?

356
00:21:02.469 --> 00:21:04.596
-You're already late. Come.
-Shoot!

357
00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:05.889
Excuse me.

358
00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:08.350
(elevator dings)

359
00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:10.227
-Mr. Ravitz.
-Nigel.

360
00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:15.107
-Issue going well?
-Oh, yes. Our best September ever.

361
00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:19.611
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn
jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot.

362
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.615
-What's that costing me?
-About 300,000.

363
00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:26.702
Must have been some lousy jackets.

364
00:21:28.328 --> 00:21:30.706
-Irv Ravitz.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

365
00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:33.083
This is Andy Sachs,
Miranda's new assistant.

366
00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.459
Congratulations, young lady.

367
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.921
A million girls would kill for that job.

368
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.423
Bye-bye.

369
00:21:40.465 --> 00:21:43.719
-Hmm?
-Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.

370
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.724
You know what they say?
Tiny man, huge ego.

371
00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:54.229
No. And I've seen
all this before.

372
00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:57.232
Theyskens is trying to reinvent
the drop waist, so actually it's--

373
00:21:57.274 --> 00:22:00.402
-Where are all the other dresses?
-We have some right here.

374
00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:03.739
-Stand, watch and listen.
-And I think it can be very interesting--

375
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.160
No. No, I just--
It's just baffling to me.

376
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:11.204
Why is it so impossible to put together
a decent run-through?

377
00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:16.752
You people have had hours and hours
to prepare. It's just so confusing to me.

378
00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:18.879
Where are the advertisers?

379
00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.548
-We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
-We need more, don't we?

380
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.302
Oh. This is-- This might be--
What do you think of--

381
00:22:25.344 --> 00:22:27.262
Yeah. Well, you know me.

382
00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:30.766
Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.

383
00:22:30.807 --> 00:22:34.311
-But do you think it's too much like--
-Like the Lacroix from July?

384
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.355
I thought that, but no,
not with the right accessories.

385
00:22:36.396 --> 00:22:39.441
-It should work.
-Where are the belts for this dre--

386
00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:41.526
Why is no one ready?

387
00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:44.905
Here. It's a tough call.

388
00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:47.449
-They're so different.
-MIRANDA: Hmm.

389
00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:49.868
(snorts, chuckles)

390
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.664
Something funny?

391
00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:01.213
No. No, no. Nothing's--

392
00:23:01.254 --> 00:23:05.092
You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.

393
00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:09.429
You know, I'm still learning
about this stuff and, uh--

394
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:12.265
"This... stuff"?

395
00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:15.894
Oh. Okay. I see.

396
00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:18.230
You think this has nothing to do with you.

397
00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:21.733
You go to your closet...

398
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:26.530
and you select-- I don't know--
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance,

399
00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:29.449
because you're trying to tell the world
that you take yourself too seriously

400
00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.952
to care about what
you put on your back.

401
00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:35.038
But what you don't know is that
that sweater is not just blue.

402
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.624
It's not turquoise.
It's not lapis.

403
00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:40.001
It's actually cerulean.

404
00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:42.254
And you're also blithely
unaware of the fact

405
00:23:42.295 --> 00:23:46.633
that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta
did a collection of cerulean gowns.

406
00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:49.177
And then I think it was Yves Saint
Laurent-- wasn't it--

407
00:23:49.219 --> 00:23:51.263
who showed cerulean military jackets?

408
00:23:51.304 --> 00:23:53.932
-I think we need a jacket here.
-Mmm.

409
00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:55.350
And then cerulean quickly showed up

410
00:23:55.392 --> 00:23:57.769
in the collections
of eight different designers.

411
00:23:57.811 --> 00:24:01.064
And then it, uh, filtered down
through the department stores

412
00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:05.235
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner,

413
00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:08.488
where you, no doubt,
fished it out of some clearance bin.

414
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:13.326
However, that blue represents millions
of dollars and countless jobs,

415
00:24:13.368 --> 00:24:16.872
and it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice

416
00:24:16.913 --> 00:24:18.874
that exempts you
from the fashion industry,

417
00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:21.460
when, in fact,
you're wearing a sweater

418
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:25.338
that was selected for you
by the people in this room,

419
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.132
from a pile of stuff.

420
00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:31.052
ANDY: So then I said,
"No, I couldn't see the difference

421
00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:33.513
between the two
absolutely identical belts,"

422
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:35.515
and you should have seen
the look she gave me!

423
00:24:35.557 --> 00:24:37.767
I thought the flesh was
gonna melt off her face.

424
00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:40.437
-(chuckles)
-It's not funny.

425
00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:44.608
She's not happy unless everyone around
her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

426
00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:47.777
And the Clackers just worship her.

427
00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.779
-The who?
-They call them Clackers.

428
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:53.116
The sound that their stilettos
make in the marble lobby.

429
00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:54.993
It's like,
"Clack, clack, clack. clack, clack."

430
00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:59.039
(groans) And they all act like
they're curing cancer or something.

431
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.751
(chuckling)
The amount of time and energy

432
00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:05.545
that these people spend
on these insignificant,

433
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.255
minute details, and for what?

434
00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:10.967
So that tomorrow they can spend
another $300,000 reshooting something

435
00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:15.722
that was probably fine to begin with
to sell people things they don't need!

436
00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:17.015
God!

437
00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:22.395
-I'm not even hungry anymore.
-What?

438
00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:25.482
-That is why those girls are so skinny.
-Oh. No, no, no.

439
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:28.068
Give me that. There's, like,
eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.

440
00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:30.904
(sighs) You know what?

441
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.325
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.

442
00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.161
And then I can do what I
came to New York to do.

443
00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.288
But I can't let Miranda get to me.

444
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.332
-I won't.
-Easy there, tiger.

445
00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:47.963
-Oh, good morning, Miranda.
-Get me Isaac.

446
00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:52.926
I don't see my breakfast here.
Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?

447
00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.719
Excuse me!

448
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:57.847
Pick up the Polaroids
from the lingerie shoot.

449
00:25:57.889 --> 00:26:01.476
Have the brakes checked on my car.

450
00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:03.895
-(truck horn honking)
-(gasps)

451
00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:07.190
Where's that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning?

452
00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:12.237
The girls need new surfboards or Boogie
boards or something for Spring Break.

453
00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:15.615
-Hello.
-The twins also need flip-flops.

454
00:26:16.783 --> 00:26:18.577
-Ow!
-Oh, my gosh!

455
00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:22.706
Pick up my shoes from Blahnik,
and then go get Patricia.

456
00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:25.625
-Who's that?
-Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

457
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:29.504
Get me that little table that I liked
at that store on Madison.

458
00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:32.716
Get us a reservation for dinner tonight
at that place that got the good review.

459
00:26:32.757 --> 00:26:34.759
-Get me Isaac.
-Thank-you notes delivered today.

460
00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:36.511
-Where is everyone?
-Why is no one working?

461
00:26:36.553 --> 00:26:39.180
(Miranda's voice overlapping)

462
00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:42.100
Get me Demarchelier.

463
00:26:49.065 --> 00:26:51.443
I have Miranda Priestly calling for--
Okay.

464
00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:54.821
I have Patrick.

465
00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:03.246
(sighs) Thank God
it's Friday, right?

466
00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:07.334
At least Miranda will be in Miami, so we
don't have to be on call this weekend.

467
00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:09.961
You know, my dad's
coming in from Ohio.

468
00:27:10.003 --> 00:27:12.672
Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner,
maybe see Chicago.

469
00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:14.883
You doing anything fun this weekend?

470
00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:17.344
Yes.

471
00:27:18.386 --> 00:27:20.388
<i>(piano music playing)</i>

472
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.266
<i>ANDY: Yeah, Nate said it was great.</i>

473
00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:26.436
He actually-- He applied here, but they
wanted someone with more experience.

474
00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:29.230
-Here.
-Huh? What's this?

475
00:27:29.272 --> 00:27:31.191
I don't want you to get behind
on your rent.

476
00:27:32.025 --> 00:27:35.070
-Dad, how did you--
-It's--

477
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.365
I'm gonna kill Mom.
(chuckles)

478
00:27:38.406 --> 00:27:40.158
Dad, thank you.

479
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.451
Mm-hmm.

480
00:27:45.163 --> 00:27:47.707
-It's really good to see you.
-You too, honey.

481
00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:53.672
So, you want to start grilling me now,
or should we wait till after dinner?

482
00:27:53.713 --> 00:27:56.049
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy
the bread basket first.

483
00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:58.885
No, no, no. It's okay.
Go right ahead.

484
00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:01.346
We're just a little worried, honey.

485
00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:04.140
We get e-mails
from you at your office at 2:00 a.m.

486
00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.810
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.

487
00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.895
Hey, that's not fair.

488
00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:10.355
I wrote those e-mails.

489
00:28:11.606 --> 00:28:14.943
I'm just trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law

490
00:28:14.984 --> 00:28:18.863
turns it down to be a journalist,
and now you're not even doing that.

491
00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:22.033
Dad, you have to trust me.

492
00:28:22.075 --> 00:28:24.911
Being Miranda's assistant
opens a lot of doors.

493
00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:28.623
Emily is going to Paris with Miranda
in a few months,

494
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:32.377
and she's gonna meet editors and writers
from every important magazine.

495
00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:34.546
And in a year, that could be me.

496
00:28:35.672 --> 00:28:37.173
-All right?
-Mm-hmm.

497
00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.884
Dad, I swear, this is my break.

498
00:28:39.926 --> 00:28:42.512
-This is my-- my chance.
-(cell phone ringing)

499
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.514
This is... my boss.

500
00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:49.853
-I'm sorry, Dad. I have to take this.
-Take it. Take it.

501
00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:53.815
-Hello. Miranda?
-My flight has been canceled.

502
00:28:53.857 --> 00:28:56.735
It's some absurd weather problem.

503
00:28:56.776 --> 00:29:00.029
I need to get home tonight. The twins
have a recital tomorrow morning at school.

504
00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:02.365
<i>-What?</i>
-At school!

505
00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:04.868
<i>-Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.</i>
-Oh, good.

506
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:07.871
Hi. Um, I know this
is totally last minute,

507
00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:10.749
but I was hoping that you could maybe
get a flight for my boss

508
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.751
from Miami to New York tonight?

509
00:29:12.792 --> 00:29:14.961
Uh--

510
00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:17.464
ANDY: Yeah, any kind of jet.

511
00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:19.340
-From Miami to New York.
-Thank you.

512
00:29:19.382 --> 00:29:21.301
-Yup, I need it tonight. I need it--
-Ow!

513
00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:23.219
-I thought you were going out the other--
-Sweetie! No.

514
00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:25.388
-It's over here, honey.
-Tonight.

515
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:28.057
Hi. I'm trying to get
a flight tonight-- for tonight--

516
00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:30.143
from Miami to New York.

517
00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:32.353
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.

518
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.483
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing is flying out?

519
00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:37.984
It's for Miranda Priestly, and I know that

520
00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:40.069
she's a client of yours,
she's flown with you before.

521
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:44.157
Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight
from Miami to New York.

522
00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:48.328
-Yeah. Sorry. Hold on.
-Hello? Miranda, hi.

523
00:29:48.369 --> 00:29:51.998
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one
is flying out because of the weather.

524
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.001
Please. It's just--
I don't know-- drizzling.

525
00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:57.378
-(thunderclap)
-Someone must be getting out.

526
00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.798
Call Donatella. Get her jet.

527
00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:02.342
<i>Call everybody else that we know</i>
<i>that has a jet. Irv?</i>

528
00:30:02.383 --> 00:30:05.094
<i>Call every-- This is your responsibi--</i>
<i>This is your job.</i>

529
00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:07.138
Get me home.

530
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.640
Oh, my God!

531
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:10.850
-She's going to murder me.
-What does she want you to do,

532
00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:13.520
call the National Guard
and have her airlifted out of there?

533
00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:15.814
Of course not.
Could I do that?

534
00:30:15.855 --> 00:30:18.233
Come on. Come on.

535
00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:22.487
The girls' recital
was absolutely wonderful.

536
00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:24.906
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.

537
00:30:24.948 --> 00:30:27.158
Everyone except me,

538
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.371
because, sadly, I was not there.

539
00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:34.123
Miranda, I'm so sorry.

540
00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:35.875
Do you know why I hired you?

541
00:30:36.709 --> 00:30:38.962
I always hire the same girl--

542
00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:42.674
stylish, slender, of course,

543
00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:44.551
worships the magazine.

544
00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:46.386
But so often, they turn out to be--

545
00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:50.265
I don't know--
disappointing and, um...

546
00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:53.309
...stupid.

547
00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:58.439
So you, with that
impressive resume

548
00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:01.526
and the big speech about
your so-called work ethic--

549
00:31:01.568 --> 00:31:04.612
I, um-- I thought you
would be different.

550
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.407
I said to myself, go ahead.

551
00:31:08.616 --> 00:31:09.826
Take a chance.

552
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:13.413
Hire the smart, fat girl.

553
00:31:13.454 --> 00:31:16.124
(clears throat)
I had hope.

554
00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:19.711
My God. I live on it.

555
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:23.506
Anyway, you ended up
disappointing me more than, um--

556
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:28.011
more than any
of the other silly girls.

557
00:31:29.929 --> 00:31:34.559
Um, I really did everything
I could think of.

558
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:36.185
-Uh--
-That's all.

559
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:48.990
Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?

560
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.469
She hates me, Nigel.

561
00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:13.389
And that's my problem because--

562
00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:15.725
Oh, wait.
No, it's not my problem.

563
00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.101
I don't know what else I can do

564
00:32:17.143 --> 00:32:20.229
because if I do something right,
it's unacknowledged.

565
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.814
She doesn't even say thank you.

566
00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:26.319
But if I do something wrong,
she is vicious.

567
00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:31.074
-So quit.
-What?

568
00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:33.368
-Quit.
-Quit?

569
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:35.703
I can get another girl to take
your job in five minutes--

570
00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:37.997
one who really wants it.

571
00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:40.625
No, I don't want to quit.
That's not fair.

572
00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:44.963
But, you know, I'm just saying that
I would just like a little credit

573
00:32:45.004 --> 00:32:47.632
for the fact that I'm
killing myself trying.

574
00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:49.968
Andy, be serious.

575
00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:51.719
You are not trying.

576
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.597
-You are whining.
-I...

577
00:32:56.724 --> 00:32:58.351
What is it that you want me
to say to you, huh?

578
00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:00.353
Do you want me to say,
"Poor you.

579
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:03.272
Miranda's picking on you.
Poor you. Poor Andy"?

580
00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:05.858
Hmm? Wake up, six.

581
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.486
She's just doing her job.

582
00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:10.863
Don't you know that you
are working at the place

583
00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:13.449
that published some
of the greatest artists of the century?

584
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:16.911
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.

585
00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:20.415
And what they did, what they created,

586
00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:24.377
was greater than art
because you live your life in it.

587
00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:29.007
Well, not you, obviously,
but some people.

588
00:33:29.882 --> 00:33:32.593
You think this is just a magazine, hmm?

589
00:33:32.635 --> 00:33:34.762
This is not just a magazine.

590
00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:37.932
This is a shining
beacon of hope for--

591
00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:41.394
oh, I don't know--

592
00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:44.188
let's say a young boy growing up
in Rhode Island with six brothers,

593
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.400
pretending to go to soccer practice when
he was really going to sewing class

594
00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:50.111
and reading<i> Runway</i> under the covers
at night with a flashlight.

595
00:33:51.154 --> 00:33:53.573
You have no idea how many legends
have walked these halls.

596
00:33:53.614 --> 00:33:55.992
And what's worse, you don't care.

597
00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:59.996
Because this place,
where so many people would die to work,

598
00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:01.914
you only deign to work.

599
00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:06.753
And you want to know why
she doesn't kiss you on the forehead

600
00:34:06.794 --> 00:34:11.007
and give you a gold star
on your homework at the end of the day.

601
00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:14.427
Wake up, sweetheart.

602
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:19.307
(sighs)

603
00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:24.312
-Okay. So I'm screwing it up.
-Mmm.

604
00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.731
I don't want to.

605
00:34:26.773 --> 00:34:29.192
I just wish that I knew
what I could do to--

606
00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:36.949
-(sighs) Nigel?
-Hmm?

607
00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:39.243
Nigel, Nigel.

608
00:34:41.537 --> 00:34:42.747
No.

609
00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:45.166
I don't know what you expect me to do.

610
00:34:45.958 --> 00:34:48.586
There's nothing in this whole closet
that'll fit a size six.

611
00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:49.754
I can guarantee you.

612
00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:55.843
These are all sample sizes--
two and four.

613
00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:58.679
All right. We're doing
this for you.

614
00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:00.181
-And--
-A poncho?

615
00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:02.850
You'll take what I give you
and you'll like it.

616
00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:05.770
-We're doing this Dolce for you.
-Hmm!

617
00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:08.272
And shoes.

618
00:35:09.148 --> 00:35:12.068
-Jimmy Choo's.
-Hmm.

619
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.570
-Manolo Blahnik.
-Wow.

620
00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.490
Nancy Gonzalez.
Love that.

621
00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:20.368
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez.
This we love.

622
00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:24.205
-Uh, it might fit. It might.
-What?

623
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:26.958
Okay. Now, Chanel. You're
in desperate need of Chanel.

624
00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:28.251
Darling, shall we?

625
00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:29.794
We have to get to the
beauty department,

626
00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:32.213
and God knows how long
that's going to take.

627
00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:33.631
(groans)

628
00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:36.425
I mean, I have no idea
why Miranda hired her.

629
00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:38.052
Me neither.

630
00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:39.929
The other day, we were
in the beauty department.

631
00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:43.391
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash
curler and said, "What is this?"

632
00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:45.768
(laughing)

633
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.563
I just knew from
the moment I saw her,

634
00:35:48.604 --> 00:35:51.566
she was going to be
a complete and utter disas--

635
00:36:00.783 --> 00:36:03.953
-(phone rings)
-Miranda Priestly's office.

636
00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:07.456
No, actually, she's not available,
but I'll leave word.

637
00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:08.916
Okay, thanks. Bye.

638
00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:11.335
(clears throat)

639
00:36:11.377 --> 00:36:13.129
How did-- (scoffs)

640
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.966
-Are you wearing the--
-The Chanel boots?

641
00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:18.301
Yeah, I am.

642
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:21.596
You look good.

643
00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.516
-Oh, God.
-What?

644
00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:29.896
-She does.
-Oh, shut up, Serena.

645
00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:35.443
-See you guys tomorrow.
-Good night, man. Take it easy.

646
00:36:35.484 --> 00:36:37.486
Take care of that finger, huh?

647
00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:59.133
So, what do you think?

648
00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:03.221
Uh, I think we better
get out of here

649
00:37:03.262 --> 00:37:05.223
before my girlfriend sees me.

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:58.276

670
00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:13.624
So we spent a whole semester
on potatoes alone.

671
00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:15.543
You take the fry and squeeze it.

672
00:38:15.584 --> 00:38:18.671
-See how firm that is?
-Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

673
00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:22.174
There was a crisis
in the accessories department.

674
00:38:22.216 --> 00:38:25.303
-I needed to find a python headband.
-Python's hot right now.

675
00:38:25.344 --> 00:38:29.098
I have exciting presents for all of you.

676
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.224
Are you ready?

677
00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:35.563
-What is that?
-It's a Bang &amp; Olufsen phone.

678
00:38:35.604 --> 00:38:38.274
Charlie Rose sent it
to Miranda for her birthday.

679
00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:41.652
I looked it up on line. It's $1,100.

680
00:38:41.694 --> 00:38:43.446
-What?
-Wow!

681
00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:46.824
And I have some products.
Mason Pearson hairbrushes.

682
00:38:46.866 --> 00:38:49.243
-A little Clinique.
-Ooh!

683
00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:52.872
-Oh, damn it. I love your job.
-Oh! One more.

684
00:38:52.913 --> 00:38:56.042
-A little thing.
-(gasps)

685
00:38:56.083 --> 00:38:59.045
-Do you want it? You want-- Oh.
-Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!

686
00:38:59.086 --> 00:39:01.964
-I think she likes it.
-Oh, my God! This is the new Marc Jacobs!

687
00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.633
This is sold out everywhere.
Where did you get this?

688
00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:07.136
Miranda didn't want it, so--

689
00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.638
No, no, no, no, no.
This bag is, like, $1,900.

690
00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.684
-I cannot take this from you. (cackles)
-Yeah, you can.

691
00:39:13.726 --> 00:39:16.687
-Why do women need so many bags?
-Shut up.

692
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:19.607
You have one. You put all your junk in it,
and that's it. You're done.

693
00:39:19.648 --> 00:39:21.650
Fashion is not about utility.

694
00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:24.737
An accessory is merely
a piece of iconography

695
00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:26.822
used to express individual identity.

696
00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:30.326
-Oh! And it's pretty.
-That too.

697
00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:32.161
Yeah. But the thing is,
it turns out

698
00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:34.080
there is more to<i> Runway</i>
than just fancy purses.

699
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:38.167
Look, here's an essay by Jay McInerney,
a piece by Joan Didion.

700
00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:41.379
Even an interview
with Christiane Amanpour.

701
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.339
Looks like someone's
been drinking the Kool-Aid.

702
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:46.509
-What are you--
-(cell phone ringing)

703
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.927
I got it. It's--

704
00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:49.720
-Yup, the Dragon Lady.
-Oh, Miranda?

705
00:39:49.762 --> 00:39:51.055
-Let me talk to her.
-I need that.

706
00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:52.473
I'll tell her to get
her own scrambled eggs.

707
00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:56.310
Lily, no, no, no! Put that thing up!
I was gonna answer it!

708
00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:59.063
It's gonna make--
Give me the... phone.

709
00:39:59.105 --> 00:40:01.315
(beeps)

710
00:40:01.357 --> 00:40:04.402
-(laughs)
-Hi, Miranda.

711
00:40:04.443 --> 00:40:07.530
Ooh. Shh. Absolutely.

712
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:10.741
-Shh!
-Uh-huh. I'm leaving right now.

713
00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:15.913
You know, you guys
didn't have to be such assholes.

714
00:40:26.799 --> 00:40:28.676
(rings)

715
00:40:32.388 --> 00:40:34.598
(electronic music playing)

716
00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:49.071
Um, excuse me.

717
00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.698
I'm looking for James Holt.

718
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.285
Um, that's him
right there.

719
00:40:54.326 --> 00:40:57.204
-Oh. Thanks.
-No problem.

720
00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:58.622
-I put my stuff out there,
-Really?

721
00:40:58.664 --> 00:40:59.999
and I pray they improve.

722
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.209
-Excuse me.
-Hi.

723
00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:05.045
I'm Andy. I'm picking up
for Miranda Priestly.

724
00:41:05.087 --> 00:41:07.798
Oh, yes.
You must be the new Emily.

725
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.468
-(chuckling)
-Nice to meet you.

726
00:41:10.509 --> 00:41:12.094
Oh, let me see that bag.

727
00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:14.138
-Ah.
-Very, very nice.

728
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:17.641
Distressed, studded leather, pieced
by hand, finished with a metallic fringe.

729
00:41:17.683 --> 00:41:20.728
(clicks tongue) Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

730
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:22.855
You.

731
00:41:22.897 --> 00:41:24.815
Hmm. Duh.

732
00:41:25.774 --> 00:41:27.026
This way.

733
00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:32.072
Uh, here we go.

734
00:41:32.114 --> 00:41:33.782
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress
for the benefit.

735
00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:35.701
Also the centerpiece
of my spring collection.

736
00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:37.286
(whispers) Top secret stuff.

737
00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:39.622
-I'll guard it with my life.
-Please do.

738
00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.499
Come on. You're working
for Miranda Priestly now.

739
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.042
You must be in desperate need
of hard liquor.

740
00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:48.297
Excuse us, girls.

741
00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:50.382
She'll have the punch.

742
00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.510
(clears throat)

743
00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:56.764
It's deadly. Have fun.

744
00:41:56.805 --> 00:41:59.016
(up-tempo music playing)

745
00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:02.144
<i>♪ And that you never seem</i>
<i>to be in short supply of ♪</i>

746
00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:04.855
-He's right, you know.
-Hmm?

747
00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:07.816
The punch.
I drank it at James's last party.

748
00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:11.654
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing
but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

749
00:42:11.695 --> 00:42:15.074
<i>-♪ You know I've wanted you so long ♪</i>
-Ah. Well.

750
00:42:15.115 --> 00:42:17.284
-Wise.
-(chuckling)

751
00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:19.912
-Uh, hi.
-Christian Thompson.

752
00:42:21.664 --> 00:42:24.166
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.

753
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.920
No, you're-- You write for, like,
every magazine I love.

754
00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:31.507
I actually-- I reviewed your collection
of essays for my college newspaper.

755
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:33.425
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

756
00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:36.929
-No, but--
-What do you do?

757
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.475
Oh. Well, I want to work
for somewhere

758
00:42:41.517 --> 00:42:43.310
like<i> The New Yorker</i>
or<i> Vanity Fair.</i>

759
00:42:43.352 --> 00:42:45.354
-I am a writer too.
-Is that right?

760
00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:46.689
-Mm-hmm.
-I should read your stuff.

761
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.774
-Why don't you send it over?
-Yeah?

762
00:42:50.526 --> 00:42:54.029
That would be-- Thank you.
That would be great. (giggling)

763
00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:57.533
But actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

764
00:42:57.575 --> 00:43:00.035
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.

765
00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:03.622
That's-- Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.

766
00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:09.086
-Excuse me?
-Well, you seem nice, smart.

767
00:43:09.128 --> 00:43:10.963
You can't do that job.

768
00:43:13.674 --> 00:43:15.175
Gotta go.

769
00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:16.510
Okay.

770
00:43:16.552 --> 00:43:20.764
Well, it was very, very nice
to meet you, Miranda girl.

771
00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:36.780
Emily?

772
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.416
Call James Holt's office.

773
00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:49.877
Tell them I want to move the
preview up to today at 12:30.

774
00:43:49.918 --> 00:43:53.130
Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.

775
00:43:53.172 --> 00:43:57.468
But we're not expected until Tuesday.
Did she say why?

776
00:43:57.509 --> 00:44:00.262
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail
of her decision making.

777
00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:03.098
And then we brushed each other's hair
and gabbed about<i> American Idol.</i>

778
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.850
I see your point.

779
00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:07.936
<i>-ANDY: What's a preview anyway?</i>
-Good morning, Miranda.

780
00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.772
<i>NIGEL: Miranda insists upon seeing</i>

781
00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:12.566
<i>all the designers' collections</i>
<i>before they show them.</i>

782
00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:14.401
-Great to see you.
-Hello, James.

783
00:44:14.443 --> 00:44:17.488
<i>-ANDY: And she tells them what she thinks?</i>
<i>-NIGEL: In her way.</i>

784
00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:21.075
Uh, this season really began for me
with a meditation

785
00:44:21.116 --> 00:44:23.827
on the intersection between East and West.

786
00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:27.414
<i>NIGEL: There's a scale.</i>
<i>One nod is good. Two nods is very good.</i>

787
00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:29.875
<i>There's only been one actual</i>
<i>smile on record,</i>

788
00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:31.669
<i>and that was Tom Ford in 2001.</i>

789
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.961
An obi belt.

790
00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:35.005
<i>NIGEL: She doesn't like it,</i>
<i>she shakes her head.</i>

791
00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:39.802
This is the dress that we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.

792
00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:42.596
<i>NIGEL: Then, of course,</i>
<i>there's the pursing of the lips.</i>

793
00:44:42.638 --> 00:44:43.806
<i>ANDY: Which means?</i>

794
00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:50.771
<i>NIGEL: Catastrophe.</i>

795
00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:54.108
(whispers) Just, uh-- Just go.

796
00:44:54.149 --> 00:44:57.778
-I just don't understand. I'm appalled.
-It's absurd. Appalled.

797
00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.613
-You deal with it.
-I'll talk to him.

798
00:45:00.614 --> 00:45:04.410
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

799
00:45:04.451 --> 00:45:06.495
You still don't get it, do you?

800
00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.997
Her opinion is the only one that matters.

801
00:45:11.583 --> 00:45:14.628
-Call my husband and confirm dinner.
-At Pastis? Done.

802
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:16.839
And I'll need a change of clothes.

803
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.550
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

804
00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:26.598
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

805
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.684
-Have Emily give you the key.
-Mm-hmm.

806
00:45:31.103 --> 00:45:33.647
-Guard this with your life.
-Of course.

807
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:37.860
You know, if I can deliver the Book,

808
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:39.737
that means I must have
done something right.

809
00:45:39.778 --> 00:45:41.196
I'm not a psycho.

810
00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:43.699
Oh, and, you know,
she called me Andrea?

811
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:47.161
I mean, she didn't call me Emily,
which is-- Isn't that great?

812
00:45:47.202 --> 00:45:49.663
Yeah, whoopee. Right.

813
00:45:51.874 --> 00:45:56.003
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

814
00:45:56.044 --> 00:45:58.046
Oh. Okay.

815
00:45:58.088 --> 00:46:01.258
<i>EMILY: The Book is assembled</i>
<i>by 10:00, 10:30,</i>

816
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.677
<i>and you must wait around</i>
<i>for it until then.</i>

817
00:46:04.887 --> 00:46:08.515
You will be delivering
Miranda's dry cleaning with the Book.

818
00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:13.812
<i>Now, the car will take you</i>
<i>straight to Miranda's townhouse.</i>

819
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.398
<i>You let yourself in.</i>

820
00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:22.613
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.

821
00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:24.948
Do not look at anyone.

822
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.534
This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.

823
00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:30.078
-Do you understand?
-Uh-huh.

824
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.582
<i>You open the door</i>
<i>and you walk across the foyer.</i>

825
00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:38.045
<i>You hang the dry cleaning</i>
<i>in the closet across from the staircase.</i>

826
00:46:44.676 --> 00:46:45.761
Uh--

827
00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:48.931
<i>And you leave the Book</i>
<i>on the table with the flowers.</i>

828
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.437
(panting)

829
00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:58.816
-Shit!
-GIRL: It's that door to the left.

830
00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:04.738
Okay.

831
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:13.247
(whispers) Thank you.

832
00:47:15.249 --> 00:47:19.253
-You can give the Book to us.
-Shh. Which-- Which table?

833
00:47:19.294 --> 00:47:22.005
-It's okay. Come on up.
-No, I can't. I can't.

834
00:47:22.047 --> 00:47:23.173
-What? It's okay.
-Come on.

835
00:47:23.215 --> 00:47:25.467
-Yeah, come on. It's okay.
-Please stop talking.

836
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:30.347
Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.

837
00:47:30.389 --> 00:47:34.476
She does? Right.
She does, all the time.

838
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.520
Yeah? Okay.

839
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.110
(giggling)

840
00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:47.489
MIRANDA: What did you expect me to do,
walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?

841
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:49.491
MAN: I rushed out of
an investment committee meeting,

842
00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:51.493
and I sat there waiting
for you for almost an hour.

843
00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.287
I told you the cell phones didn't work.

844
00:47:53.328 --> 00:47:54.997
Nobody could get a signal out.

845
00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:57.082
MAN: I knew what everyone in
that restaurant was thinking--

846
00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:59.376
there he is, waiting for her again.

847
00:48:24.985 --> 00:48:27.112
-Okay, okay! Okay, okay.
-Oh, no. Shh!

848
00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:29.406
It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.

849
00:48:29.448 --> 00:48:31.700
The twins said hello,
so I said hello back.

850
00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.744
Then I went up the stairs
to give her the Book and--

851
00:48:33.785 --> 00:48:36.163
You went upstairs?
You went upstairs.

852
00:48:36.204 --> 00:48:37.873
Oh, my God. Why didn't you just

853
00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:40.042
climb into bed with her and ask
for a bedtime story?

854
00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.793
Okay, I made a mistake.
I know.

855
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.922
Andrea, you don't understand.

856
00:48:44.963 --> 00:48:48.050
If you get fired,
that might jeopardize Paris for me.

857
00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.927
If that happens, I will search
every Blimpie's

858
00:48:49.968 --> 00:48:51.929
in the tristate area
until I track you down.

859
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.221
She's gonna fire me?

860
00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:57.059
I don't know.
She's not happy.

861
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.685
MIRANDA: Andrea?

862
00:49:00.687 --> 00:49:02.189
(snaps fingers)

863
00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:11.782
Miranda, about last night, I--

864
00:49:11.823 --> 00:49:14.451
I need the new
Harry Potter book for the twins.

865
00:49:14.493 --> 00:49:17.955
Okay. Okay. I'll go down
to Barnes &amp; Noble right now.

866
00:49:17.996 --> 00:49:21.041
Did you fall down and smack
your little head on the pavement?

867
00:49:23.752 --> 00:49:25.128
Not that I can recall.

868
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.005
We have all the published
Harry Potter books.

869
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:28.674
The twins want to know what happens next.

870
00:49:30.842 --> 00:49:33.053
You want the unpublished manuscript?

871
00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:36.848
We know everyone in publishing.
It shouldn't be a problem, should it?

872
00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:39.351
And you can do anything, right?

873
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.773
(cell phone rings)

874
00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:49.820
Yes, Bobbsey. I know, baby.

875
00:49:49.861 --> 00:49:52.489
Mommy's working very hard
to get it for you.

876
00:49:52.531 --> 00:49:53.824
She doesn't get it.

877
00:49:53.865 --> 00:49:56.535
You know, I could call frickin'
J.K. Rowling herself.

878
00:49:56.576 --> 00:49:58.412
I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.

879
00:49:58.453 --> 00:50:00.706
My girls are leaving on the train
for their grandmother's at 4:00,

880
00:50:00.747 --> 00:50:03.291
so the book better be here
no later than 3:00.

881
00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.668
Of course!

882
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:08.046
And I would like my steak
here in 15 minutes.

883
00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:10.716
No problem!
(panting)

884
00:50:10.757 --> 00:50:14.177
Okay. I have four hours
to get the impossible manuscript.

885
00:50:14.219 --> 00:50:16.805
Smith &amp; Wollensky's
doesn't open until 11:30.

886
00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.557
How am I gonna get the steak?

887
00:50:19.474 --> 00:50:22.602
Okay. I will be back in 15 minutes.

888
00:50:22.644 --> 00:50:24.646
-Wish me luck!
-No. Shan't.

889
00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:28.567
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I've been on hold.
Well, it's for Miranda Priestly.

890
00:50:28.608 --> 00:50:30.610
It's very important.

891
00:50:30.652 --> 00:50:33.238
Yes, I know
it's impossible to get,

892
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.658
but, well, I was wondering if you could
make the impossible possible,

893
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.827
if that's at all possible.
(laughing)

894
00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:42.205
Yes, I'm calling about
the Harry Potter manuscript.

895
00:50:42.247 --> 00:50:45.333
Uh, no. Unpublished.

896
00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:46.877
Not a chance?

897
00:50:47.669 --> 00:50:49.838
Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.

898
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.256
'Cause I think it makes a difference.

899
00:50:56.803 --> 00:50:58.764
Let me call you back.

900
00:50:58.805 --> 00:51:02.017
Hi, you probably don't remember me.
We met at James Holt's party.

901
00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:03.894
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.

902
00:51:03.935 --> 00:51:07.147
The Harry Potter manuscript?
Oh, you're kidding.

903
00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:10.692
<i>Uh, sorry to ask, but I'm desperate.</i>

904
00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:14.029
Just tell her it can't be done.
You'll have to come up with a Plan "B."

905
00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:16.656
Well, this is Miranda Priestly
we're talking about.

906
00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:18.617
There is no Plan "B."
There's only Plan "A."

907
00:51:19.826 --> 00:51:22.120
Is she back? Am I fired?

908
00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:25.082
I rarely say this
to people who aren't me,

909
00:51:25.123 --> 00:51:27.834
but you have got to calm down.

910
00:51:27.876 --> 00:51:29.336
Bloody hell!

911
00:51:35.634 --> 00:51:36.843
Coat, bag.

912
00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:42.182
What's that?
Oh, I don't want that.

913
00:51:42.224 --> 00:51:44.392
I'm having lunch with Irv.
I'll be back at 3:00.

914
00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.895
I'd like my Starbucks waiting.

915
00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:52.067
Oh, and if you don't have
that Harry Potter book by then,

916
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:54.152
don't even bother coming back.

917
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:07.290
(phone rings)

918
00:52:07.332 --> 00:52:08.583
Hello.

919
00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:12.129
Quit? Are you sure?

920
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.297
I failed.
She's gonna fire me anyway.

921
00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:16.758
-I might as well beat her to the punch.
<i>-Wow.</i>

922
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.679
Andy, good for you.
Congratulations. You're free.

923
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.723
-Yeah. Well, listen, I'll call you later.
<i>-Okay.</i>

924
00:52:23.765 --> 00:52:26.476
-(line clicks, phone rings)
-Hello.

925
00:52:26.518 --> 00:52:28.562
I'm brilliant. No, really.

926
00:52:28.603 --> 00:52:31.481
<i>Monuments should be erected in my honor.</i>

927
00:52:31.523 --> 00:52:33.608
-You didn't.
-Oh, yes.

928
00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.318
A friend of a friend does the cover art,

929
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.445
and she happens
to have the manuscript.

930
00:52:39.698 --> 00:52:43.535
Oh, no, 'cause that would mean
that I actually did something right.

931
00:52:43.577 --> 00:52:46.329
(chuckles)
It's just-- Ugh!

932
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:49.040
The thing is, Christian, I was just--

933
00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:50.542
Look, you want this thing,
you better hurry.

934
00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:52.544
I'll meet you at the St. Regis.

935
00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.096
-Excuse me.
-(horn honks)

936
00:53:13.982 --> 00:53:15.400
Welcome to the St. Regis.

937
00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:16.860
-May I assist you with anything?
-Oh. Yes.

938
00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:19.029
Uh, I'm meeting someone
at the King Cole Bar.

939
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:20.071
Right this way.

940
00:53:22.324 --> 00:53:23.617
Hi.

941
00:53:24.409 --> 00:53:26.286
-You have one hour.
-Thank you.

942
00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.632
One copy.

943
00:53:38.673 --> 00:53:41.760
What are my twins
gonna do with that? Share?

944
00:53:41.801 --> 00:53:44.596
Oh, no, I made two copies...
and had them covered,

945
00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:47.307
reset and bound so that they
wouldn't look like manuscripts.

946
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:50.560
This is an extra copy to have on file.
You know, just in case.

947
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:54.272
Well, where are these fabulous copies?
I don't see them anywhere.

948
00:53:54.314 --> 00:53:56.149
(whistle blows)

949
00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:00.362
<i>ANDY: They're with the twins,</i>
<i>on the train on the way to Grandma's.</i>

950
00:54:02.656 --> 00:54:04.741
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

951
00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:10.080
Mm-mm. That's all.

952
00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.915
Okay.

953
00:54:24.886 --> 00:54:27.055
(door opens)

954
00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:30.600
-Hey.
-Hey. I went to Dean &amp; Deluca.

955
00:54:30.642 --> 00:54:33.687
Man, they charge, like,
five dollars a strawberry there.

956
00:54:33.728 --> 00:54:37.399
But I figure since you quit your job,

957
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.526
we should celebrate.

958
00:54:39.567 --> 00:54:42.362
-Listen, Nate.
-Wait a minute.

959
00:54:42.404 --> 00:54:45.657
You quit your job, but you're still
working on the twins' science project?

960
00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:50.120
Well, that's big of you.

961
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:55.458
Okay, after we talked, I realized
it doesn't make sense

962
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.962
throwing away all those
months of hard work.

963
00:54:59.004 --> 00:55:01.548
I just had a moment of weakness,
that's all.

964
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:04.884
Yeah, well, either that, or your job sucks
and your boss is a wacko.

965
00:55:07.887 --> 00:55:09.222
All right.

966
00:55:09.931 --> 00:55:11.808
Whatever. It's your job.

967
00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:15.937
Nate.

968
00:55:17.105 --> 00:55:18.565
Come on.

969
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:21.359
I'm still the same person I was.

970
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:23.361
I still want the same things.

971
00:55:24.404 --> 00:55:25.697
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

972
00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:29.200
I promise. Same Andy, better clothes.

973
00:55:29.242 --> 00:55:31.786
-(giggles)
-I like the old clothes.

974
00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:34.956
Really?

975
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.585
Well, what about these necklaces?
Do you like them?

976
00:55:40.253 --> 00:55:43.923
No? And this dress,
it's new.

977
00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:46.801
Eh.

978
00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:50.388
Well, there is one
other thing that's new

979
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:52.849
that I thought you might like.

980
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:56.227
But, uh--
What about this?

981
00:55:56.269 --> 00:55:58.104
<i>(up-tempo music playing)</i>

982
00:55:58.146 --> 00:56:00.065
You don't like it.
I should better do--

983
00:56:00.106 --> 00:56:01.858
No, no, no, no.

984
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.819

00:56:21.002 --> 00:56:24.214
Is this number two look?
This is number two?

989
00:56:24.255 --> 00:56:26.174
-Hi.
-Hi. All right.

990
00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:28.009
Turn around for me, darling.

991
00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:32.305
Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it.
The piece is called "Urban Jungle," right?

992
00:56:32.347 --> 00:56:36.684
Yes, the modern woman unleashes
the animal within to take on the big city.

993
00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:38.520
(growls)
Good. Go.

994
00:56:39.687 --> 00:56:43.108
(sighs) Sometimes I can't believe
I talk about this crap all day.

995
00:56:43.149 --> 00:56:45.819
-Bobby, come here. Let me see.
-Oh, thank you.

996
00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.695
Make sure Miranda gets these
as soon as possible.

997
00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:50.448
And tell her I switched
in the Dior for the Rocha.

998
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:55.078
-Oh, great. Can't wait.
-Excuse me.

999
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.664
-Can we adjust the attitude?
-I'm sorry.

1000
00:56:57.705 --> 00:56:59.332
Don't make me feed you
to one of the models.

1001
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:02.502
I'm sorry.
It's a busy day.

1002
00:57:02.544 --> 00:57:05.171
My personal life is hanging
by a thread, that's all.

1003
00:57:05.213 --> 00:57:08.466
Join the club. That's what happens when
you start doing well at work, darling.

1004
00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:11.678
Let me know when your
whole life goes up in smoke.

1005
00:57:11.719 --> 00:57:13.888
That means it's time for a promotion.

1006
00:57:21.396 --> 00:57:24.441
No. All right, February,
back of the issue.

1007
00:57:24.482 --> 00:57:27.110
Did anybody speak
with Salma's people yet?

1008
00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:29.946
Yes, but she'd rather do a summer cover
because she has a movie coming out.

1009
00:57:29.988 --> 00:57:34.242
No. Also, I'm pulling the Toobin piece
on the Supreme Court women--

1010
00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:35.994
(inhales) woman.

1011
00:57:36.035 --> 00:57:38.037
And I need to see a new
draft on that piece

1012
00:57:38.079 --> 00:57:40.957
about shopping for a plastic surgeon--
It's dull.

1013
00:57:41.749 --> 00:57:45.086
And this layout
for the Winter Wonderland spread.

1014
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:48.089
Not wonderful yet.

1015
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:50.008
Oh, okay. I-I'll look at it.

1016
00:57:50.049 --> 00:57:52.093
What about Testino?
Where are we on that?

1017
00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:54.345
Zac Posen's doing
some very sculptural suits.

1018
00:57:54.387 --> 00:57:57.849
So I suggested that, uh, Testino shoot
them at the Noguchi Garden.

1019
00:57:57.891 --> 00:57:59.726
Perfect.

1020
00:57:59.767 --> 00:58:02.395
Thank God somebody
came to work today.

1021
00:58:02.437 --> 00:58:04.272
What about accessories for April?

1022
00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:08.860
One thought I had was enamel.
Um, bangles, pendants, earrings.

1023
00:58:08.902 --> 00:58:11.070
No. We did that two years ago.
What else?

1024
00:58:11.112 --> 00:58:14.491
Um, well, they're showing a lot of florals
right now, so I was thinking--

1025
00:58:14.532 --> 00:58:18.995
Florals? For spring?
Groundbreaking.

1026
00:58:19.037 --> 00:58:21.247
But we thought about shooting them
in an industrial space.

1027
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:23.875
We thought the contrast
between the femininity of the florals

1028
00:58:23.917 --> 00:58:25.835
and the more raw,
rough-hewn background

1029
00:58:25.877 --> 00:58:27.378
would create this
wonderful tension between--

1030
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.173
-No.
-Which?

1031
00:58:30.215 --> 00:58:32.008
-(Emily coughing)
-No.

1032
00:58:35.845 --> 00:58:38.723
(coughing continues)

1033
00:58:38.765 --> 00:58:41.726
Does anybody else have anything
I can possibly use?

1034
00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:45.647
Antibacterial wipes perhaps?

1035
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.441
(groans)

1036
00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:54.322
-How's the cold doing?
-Like death warmed up, actually.

1037
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:57.742
(sniffles) Oh, God.
It's the benefit tonight.

1038
00:58:57.784 --> 00:58:59.577
I've been looking forward to it
for months.

1039
00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:00.912
I refuse to be sick.

1040
00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:03.248
I'm wearing Valentino,
for crying out loud.

1041
00:59:05.124 --> 00:59:08.086
Right. Well, everybody
will be leaving soon to get ready,

1042
00:59:08.127 --> 00:59:12.090
so I suggest you go and drop Miranda's
Fendi bag off at the showroom,

1043
00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:14.259
and then I suppose
you can just go home.

1044
00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:19.597
Yeah? Oh, well, that is great.
Perfect actually.

1045
00:59:19.639 --> 00:59:21.724
I need to get to Magnolia Bakery
before it closes.

1046
00:59:21.766 --> 00:59:23.184
It's Nate's birthday tonight.

1047
00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:25.728
So we're, uh,
having a little party for him.

1048
00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:28.940
Yeah, I'm hearing this,
and I wanna hear this.

1049
00:59:30.316 --> 00:59:31.651
Bye.

1050
00:59:33.653 --> 00:59:37.156
I love my job. I love my job.
I love my job.

1051
00:59:37.198 --> 00:59:40.118
(chattering)

1052
00:59:42.203 --> 00:59:44.038
(cell phone rings)

1053
00:59:45.373 --> 00:59:46.916
Hello?

1054
00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:53.840
Before the benefit tonight,
I need to make sure

1055
00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:56.634
that you're both fully prepped
on the guest list.

1056
00:59:57.719 --> 01:00:01.389
But I thought that only
the first assistant went to the benefit.

1057
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.601
Only when the first assistant
hasn't decided to become

1058
01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:07.562
an incubus of viral plague.

1059
01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.273
You'll come and help Emily.

1060
01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:15.278
-That's all.
-Right.

1061
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.823
These are all of the guests.
Miranda invites everyone.

1062
01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:22.577
We have to make sure that they all think
she knows exactly who they are.

1063
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.829
And I've been studying for weeks.

1064
01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.706
I have to learn all these by tonight?

1065
01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:29.125
No, don't be silly, Andrea.
These too.

1066
01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.128
Look, you better
just start without me, okay?

1067
01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:35.048
-I'll get there as soon as I can.
-Andy, come on, it's his birth--

1068
01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:38.301
Okay, but hurry.

1069
01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.595
Oh, please, believe me, I will.
This is the last thing that I wanna--

1070
01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.513
Ooh, I love that.

1071
01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:45.058
Uh, I'll call you the second
I'm leaving, okay?

1072
01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:47.602
-Will that fit me?
-Oh, yeah.

1073
01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.480
A little Crisco and some fishing line,
and we're in business.

1074
01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:52.106

1075

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:23.471

1083
01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:48.496
-Do I?
-Yeah.

1084
01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:50.665
Oh, it's for Paris.
I'm on this new diet.

1085
01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.917
It's very effective.
Well, I don't eat anything.

1086
01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:56.087
And then when I feel like I'm about
to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.

1087
01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.464
-Well, it's definitely working.
-I know.

1088
01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.717
I'm just one stomach flu

1095
01:02:21.654 --> 01:02:24.407
-John, thanks for coming.
-Hey, there.

1096
01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.075
JOHN: Oh, thank you.
It's always nice seeing you.

1097
01:02:26.117 --> 01:02:30.288
-Stop fidgeting.
-I'm sorry. I'm so late.

1098
01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:32.457
Just deal with it.
You have to be here.

1099
01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:39.964
Emily, come here.

1100
01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:42.925
Isn't that Jacqueline Follet
from<i> French Runway?</i>

1101
01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:45.094
Oh, my God,
and Miranda hates her.

1102
01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:47.054
She was supposed to arrive
after Miranda left.

1103
01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.848
-I didn't-- Oh.
-Yeah.

1104
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:53.603
-Miranda, fabulous event as always.
-You brought Jacqueline.

1105
01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:56.355
<i>-Surprise.</i>
<i>-Quelle surprise.</i>

1106
01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:00.359
Oh, wonderful.

1107
01:03:00.401 --> 01:03:02.904
We're so happy you were able
to come to our little gathering.

1108
01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:06.783
Of course.
I plan my whole year around this.

1109
01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:11.788
Well, we're so grateful that you do.

1110
01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:16.292
-Ciao.
-Have you gotten my note?

1111
01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:18.544
Yes, I did.
We'll discuss it on Wednesday.

1112
01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:22.131
-Yes, I agree. No business tonight.
-Not tonight.

1113
01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.342
-Enjoy.
-(sniffles)

1114
01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:25.760
Em.

1115
01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:28.262
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1116
01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:35.645
Oh, um-- Oh, my God.

1117
01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:37.647
I just can't remember what his name is.

1118
01:03:37.688 --> 01:03:39.816
I just saw his name
this morning on the list.

1119
01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:42.735
It's-- Oh, I know this.
It's something to do with--

1120
01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:47.990
Wait, he was-- he was part of the--
Oh, God, I know this. Um--

1121
01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:49.659
It's Ambassador Franklin,

1122
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.745
and that's the woman that
he left his wife for, Rebecca.

1123
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:58.042
-Rebecca. Ambassador.
-Miranda.

1124
01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.795
-You look fabulous.
-Oh, very kind.

1125
01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.923
-Thank you.
-(chattering continues)

1126
01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.058
-Look at you.
-Hello.

1127
01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.185
You're-- You're a vision.

1128
01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:19.063
-Oh. (scoffs)
-Thank God I saved your job.

1129
01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:20.481
(stammers, chuckles)

1130
01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.901
You know, I figured out
a few things on my own too.

1131
01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:26.487
Turns out, I'm not as nice
as you thought.

1132
01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:27.864
I hope not.

1133
01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:31.200
Well, if it weren't
for the stupid boyfriend,

1134
01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:33.327
I'd have to whisk you away
right here and now.

1135
01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:38.833
Do you actually say things
like that to people?

1136
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.919
-Evidently.
-(giggles) Well, I gotta go.

1137
01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.381
Are you sure? 'Cause my editor
for<i> New York Magazine</i> is inside,

1138
01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:47.633
and, you know,
I could introduce you two.

1139
01:04:48.926 --> 01:04:51.012
You sent over your stuff
for me to look at? Remember?

1140
01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.305
Yeah.

1141
01:04:52.346 --> 01:04:53.848
All right, I gotta admit,
I only read a couple.

1142
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.809
-It was a very large packet you sent.
-(laughing)

1143
01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:59.103
-Yeah.
-But what I did read wasn't half bad.

1144
01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:01.647
And, you know, I think--
I think you have a talent, Andy.

1145
01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:03.941
He should meet you.

1146
01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.693
Why don't you come in?
Just for one drink.

1147
01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:09.155
Um, okay, yeah.
I guess I could for one--

1148
01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:14.285
No, I can't.
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1149
01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:17.038
All right.
Give my best to the boyfriend.

1150
01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:27.423
Roy, I'm sorry.
Can you go any faster?

1151
01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.550
I'm sure Nate will understand.

1152
01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.388
Yeah.

1153
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:37.308
(TV, indistinct)

1154
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.268
Hey.

1155
01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:56.285
Happy birthday.

1156
01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:02.291
Nate, I'm so sorry.

1157
01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:07.713
I kept trying to leave,
but there was a lot going on.

1158
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:09.924
And, you know,
I didn't have a choice.

1159
01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.759
Don't worry about it.

1160
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.512
(grunts) I'm gonna go to bed.

1161
01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:18.474
Can we at least talk about this?

1162
01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:28.859
You look really pretty.

1163
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.403
MIRANDA: Andrea?

1164
01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:28.627
-Do you have the Book?
-Oh. Uh--

1165
01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:32.089
Mm.

1166
01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:37.344
Paris is the most important week
of my entire year.

1167
01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.722
I need the best
possible team with me.

1168
01:07:41.932 --> 01:07:44.268
That no longer includes Emily.

1169
01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.189
Wait. You want me to--

1170
01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:52.860
(stammering) No, Miranda.

1171
01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:55.321
(exhales) Emily would die.

1172
01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:58.115
Her whole life is about Paris.

1173
01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:03.162
She hasn't eaten in weeks.
I-I can't... do that.

1174
01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.664
Miranda, I can't.

1175
01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:07.750
If you don't go,
I'll assume you're not serious

1176
01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:11.212
about your future at<i> Runway</i> or...

1177
01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.755
any other publication.

1178
01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.387
The decision's yours.

1179
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.350
That's all.

Andrea, don't forget to tell Emily.

1199
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:34.563
Do it now.

1200
01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.742

-Don't pick up.

1201
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.786

<i>-Hi.</i>

-Emily.
<i>-Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.</i>

1204
01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:55.084
It's just Miranda wanted
some scarves from Hermès.

1205
01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.753
And she did tell me yesterday,
but I forgot like an idiot.

1206
01:10:57.795 --> 01:10:59.630
<i>And so I freaked out, of course.</i>

1207
01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:02.591
Emily, Emily,
I-I need to talk to you.

1208
01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:05.678
I called Martine at home, and she
opened the shop early. Whoa! I'm sorry.

1209
01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:08.639
She opened the shop early for me,
so I got them, which is great.

1210
01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:12.059
Okay. Um, Emily,
wh-when you come in,

1211
01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:14.186
there's something
I have to talk to you about.

1212
01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:16.146
<i>Well, I hope it's not</i>
<i>another Miranda problem.</i>

1213
01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:17.398
Not exactly.

1214
01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:21.026
Well, good, because I've got so much to
deal with before I go. I swear to God--

1215
01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.654
-(gasps)
-(horn honks)

1216
01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:27.950
-(people exclaiming)
-WOMAN: Oh, my God!

1217
01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:29.868
Emily?

1218
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:32.663
(woman on P.A., indistinct)

1219
01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.498
(elevator bell dings)

1220
01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:43.048
I don't care if she was gonna fire you
or beat you with a red-hot poker!

1221
01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.758
You should have said no.

1222
01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.844
Emily, I didn't have a choice.

1223
01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:48.929
-Oh. Please.
-You know how she is.

1224
01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.432
-That is a pathetic excuse.
-(door opens)

1225
01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.521
Thanks.

1226
01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:02.901
Do you know what really just...
gets me about this whole thing,

1227
01:12:02.943 --> 01:12:07.281
is that, you know, you're the one who said
you don't really care about this stuff.

1228
01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:11.076
And you don't really care about fashion.
You just wanna be a journalist.

1229
01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.287
What a pile of bollocks!

1230
01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:15.539
Emily, I know you're mad.
I don't blame you.

1231
01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.499
Face it, Andy, you sold your soul

1232
01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:19.668
the day you put on that first pair
of Jimmy Choo's.

1233
01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:24.465
I saw it. And you know what really just
kills me about this whole thing,

1234
01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.592
is the clothes that you're gonna get.

1235
01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:29.511
I mean, you don't deserve them.

1236
01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:32.431
You eat carbs, for Christ's sake.

1237
01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:35.517
God, it's so unfair!

1238
01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.854
-Emily.
-Just go.

1239
01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:47.446
-Emily, I--
-I said go!

1240
01:12:51.325 --> 01:12:53.535
(sighs)

1241
01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:55.329
DOUG: You are going to Paris
for the couture shows?

1242
01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:56.455
ANDY: Mm-hmm.

1243
01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.082
That's the coolest fashion event
of the year.

1244
01:12:58.123 --> 01:12:59.291
-Mm-hmm.

1245
01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.502
-Who are you going to see, Galliano?
-Yeah.

1246
01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:04.171
-And Lagerfeld and Nicholas Ghesquiere.
-Yep.

1247
01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.965
-Yes. Okay, now you're scaring me.
-(chuckles)

1248
01:13:07.007 --> 01:13:09.551
-Hey.
-Hey.

1249
01:13:09.593 --> 01:13:11.929
This show is amazing.

1250
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:14.556
-I am so proud of you.
-LILY: Thank you.

1251
01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:17.226
Okay, start with the photos in the back
and work your way forward.

1252
01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:20.020
That is the way I designed it.
It is brilliant. You will love it.

1253
01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.688
-Of course.
-And you,

1254
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.440
I have somebody
I want you to meet, okay?

1255
01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.609
-Ooh, art and sex.
-Lead the way.

1256
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:27.403
-See you later.
-Okay.

01:13:52.177 --> 01:13:55.889
-Hi.
-I was just thinking about you.

1263
01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:57.933
Oh, come on.

1264
01:13:57.975 --> 01:13:59.601
-It's true.
-No.

1265
01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:04.606
I'm profiling Gaultier for<i> Interview</i> and,
uh, making my Paris plans.

1266
01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:08.986
I found myself wondering
if, uh, you were gonna be there.

1267
01:14:09.027 --> 01:14:14.366
Well, actually, um, I am going.

1268
01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:19.163
Great. I'm staying in a fantastic
little hotel in the Seventh,

1269
01:14:19.204 --> 01:14:23.208
right across the street from the falafel
restaurant that will change your life.

1270
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:28.213
(chuckles) I'm sorry.
I'll be too busy working.

1271
01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:31.091
You'll have to find
someone else's life to change.

1272
01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.760
Well, that's just it.

1273
01:14:34.678 --> 01:14:36.722
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.

1274
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:51.737
Lily.

1275
01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:55.532
Lily, he's just a guy I know from work.

1276
01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:58.243
-Yeah, that looked like work.
-Look, you're making a big deal out of--

1277
01:14:58.285 --> 01:15:01.747
You know, the Andy I know
is madly in love with Nate,

1278
01:15:01.788 --> 01:15:04.041
is always five minutes early...

1279
01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:06.877
and thinks, I don't know,
Club Monaco is couture.

1280
01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:10.547
For the last 16 years,
I've known everything about that Andy.

1281
01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:12.049
But this person?

1282
01:15:12.090 --> 01:15:14.510
This "glamazon" who skulks
around in corners...

1283
01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:16.470
with some random hot fashion guy?

1284
01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:18.722
I don't get her.

1285
01:15:20.724 --> 01:15:23.143
-Lily.
-Have fun in Paris.

1286
01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.897
You going to Paris?

1287
01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:29.733
Uh, yeah. It just happened.

1288
01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:33.362
I thought Paris was a big deal
for Emily or--

1289
01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:35.322
Great. Now you're gonna
give me a hard time too?

1290
01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:40.827
Hey, Andy. Andy!

1291
01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:44.957
-Andy, what the hell is wrong with you?
-I-I didn't have a choice, okay?

1292
01:15:44.998 --> 01:15:47.292
-Miranda asked me, and I couldn't say no.
-I know.

1293
01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:49.503
That's your answer for everything lately,
"I didn't have a choice."

1294
01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.296
-Like this job was forced on you.
-Nate, I get it, okay?

1295
01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:53.465
Like you don't make
these decisions yourself.

1296
01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:55.926
You're mad because I work late all the
time and I missed your birthday party.

1297
01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:58.428
-And I'm sorry.
-Oh, come on. What am I, four?

1298
01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:01.306
You-- You hate<i> Runway</i>
and Miranda.

1299
01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:04.351
And you think fashion is stupid.
You've made that clear.

1300
01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.688
Andy, I make port wine
reductions all day.

1301
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:10.065
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.

1302
01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.985
You know, I wouldn't care if you were
out there pole dancing all night,

1303
01:16:13.026 --> 01:16:14.736
as long as you did it
with a little integrity.

1304
01:16:15.612 --> 01:16:17.531
You used to say this was just a job.

1305
01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.908
You used to make fun of the<i> Runway</i> girls.

1306
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:22.119
What happened?
Now you've become one of them.

1307
01:16:23.453 --> 01:16:25.038
-That's absurd.
-That's okay.

1308
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.624
That's fine. Just own up to it.

1309
01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:30.002
And then we can stop pretending like we
have anything in common anymore.

1310
01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:34.673
-You don't mean that, do you?
-No, I do.

1311
01:16:41.888 --> 01:16:46.101
Well, maybe this trip
is coming at a good time.

1312
01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:48.687
Maybe we should take a break.

1313
01:16:55.527 --> 01:16:56.778
Nate?

1314
01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.950
(cell phone ringing)

1315
01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:11.001
I'm sorry.
Just... one second?

1316
01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:15.339
You know, in case you were wondering,

1317
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:19.343
the person whose calls you always take,
that's the relationship you're in.

1318
01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:21.261
I hope you two are very happy together.

1319
01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.096
(cell phone continues ringing)

1320
01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:31.688
Hello, Miranda.

(chattering)

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:48.223
Pardon. Miranda.

1336
01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:51.226
-(speaking Italian)
-Maestro. Mmm.

1337
01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:54.312
How are you? So glad to see you.
Thank you for coming.

1338
01:18:54.354 --> 01:18:56.273
-You like the collection?
-Absolutely.

1339
01:18:56.314 --> 01:18:58.442
-I think it's the best in years.
-This is very important for me.

1340
01:18:58.483 --> 01:19:00.819
-Very, very important.
-I'm very happy for you.

1341
01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.238
-This is my new Emily.
-Hello. How do you do?

1342
01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.657
-I'm good. Pleasure.
-Nice to meet you.

1343
01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:06.867
You love the show?

1344
01:19:12.372 --> 01:19:14.708
-Miranda. This way!
-(clamoring)

1345
01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:24.259
Miranda. Nigel.
Fashion's great gatekeepers.

1346
01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:28.889
Miranda, what is<i> Runway's</i> position on
French fashion versus American fashion?

1347
01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:31.725
-I've been thinking--
-Oh.

1348
01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.728
-You still owe me for Harry Potter.
-Oh, do I?

1349
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.938
Of course you do.
Are you working tonight?

1350
01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:41.026
Oh! No, actually Miranda
has a dinner.

1351
01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:45.405
Great, you're free. Oh, but there
is the problem of<i> le</i> boyfriend.

1352
01:19:46.364 --> 01:19:49.326
Wait, don't tell me.
The boyfriend<i> non plus?</i>

1353
01:19:49.367 --> 01:19:52.120
<i>Je suis tres, très désolé.</i>

1354
01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:54.164
Oh, you're so full of it.
You're not<i> désolé</i> at all.

1355
01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.875
No, not even a little.
What time should I pick you up?

1356
01:19:57.959 --> 01:20:00.170
-Uh-- Yeah.
-I'll call you.

1357
01:20:19.731 --> 01:20:21.107
Oh.

1358
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:27.781
Oh, there you are.
(clears throat)

1359
01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:34.579
We need to go over the seating, uh,
chart for the luncheon.

1360
01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:36.957
Okay.
Um, yeah, sure.

1361
01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:39.209
I have it right here.

1362
01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:47.759
By all means, move at a glacial pace.
You know how that thrills me.

1363
01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.685
Okay.

1364
01:20:56.726 --> 01:20:58.395
So...

1365
01:21:00.313 --> 01:21:05.110
first of all, we need to
move Snoop Dogg to my table.

1366
01:21:06.069 --> 01:21:07.654
But your table's full.

1367
01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:10.699
Stephen isn't coming.

1368
01:21:11.783 --> 01:21:14.077
Oh, Stephen is--

1369
01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:18.206
So I don't need to fetch Stephen
from the airport tomorrow?

1370
01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:22.544
Well, if you speak to him and he
decides to rethink the divorce,

1371
01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:24.254
then, yes, fetch away.

1372
01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.925
You're very fetching, so go fetch.

1373
01:21:34.472 --> 01:21:38.435
And then when we get back to New York,
we need to contact, um...

1374
01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:44.357
...Leslie to see what she can do
to minimize the press...

1375
01:21:45.483 --> 01:21:46.860
...on all this.

1376
01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.990
Another divorce...

1377
01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:55.535
...splashed across<i> Page Six.</i>

1378
01:21:56.494 --> 01:21:59.456
I can just imagine what
they're gonna write about me.

1379
01:21:59.497 --> 01:22:02.918
"The Dragon Lady,"
"career-obsessed."

1380
01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:06.713
"Snow Queen drives away
another Mr. Priestly."

1381
01:22:08.548 --> 01:22:13.053
Rupert Murdoch should cut me a check
for all the papers I sell for him.

1382
01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.057
Anyway, I don't--

1383
01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:20.852
I don't really care
what anybody writes about me.

1384
01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:26.441
But my-- my girls, I just--

1385
01:22:26.483 --> 01:22:29.069
It's just so unfair to the girls.

1386
01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:31.154
It's just...

1387
01:22:34.157 --> 01:22:36.326
...another disappointment,

1388
01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:39.412
another letdown,
another father... figure...

1389
01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:41.957
(chuckles) ...gone.

1390
01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:48.380
Anyway, the point is--
(clears throat)

1391
01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:52.092
The point is-- (sighs)

1392
01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:56.429
The point is we really need to figure out
where to place Donatella,

1393
01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:59.224
because she's barely speaking to anyone.

1394
01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:11.403
I'm so sorry, Miranda.

1395
01:23:12.195 --> 01:23:14.823
If you want me to cancel
your evening, I can.

1396
01:23:14.864 --> 01:23:17.242
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would we do that?

1397
01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:20.578
Um, is--

1398
01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:23.665
Is there anything else I can do?

1399
01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.459
Your job.

1400
01:23:30.046 --> 01:23:31.464
That's all.

1401
01:23:52.902 --> 01:23:54.654
(knocking)

1402
01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:00.285
Hi. I need Miranda's itinerary
for tomorrow.

1403
01:24:00.326 --> 01:24:02.454
-Okay. Come on in.
-All right? Thanks.

1404
01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.836
-Who put that together for you?
-This?

1405
01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:12.881
Oh, it's just--
it's just something I threw on.

1406
01:24:12.922 --> 01:24:15.383
Turn around.
Let me see. Turn.

1407
01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:20.180
-Mm.<i> Incroyable.</i>
-Yeah?

1408
01:24:20.221 --> 01:24:21.389
It's really just-- No, it's--

1409
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:23.224
-No, gorgeous.
-Yeah? Okay, good.

1410
01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:25.351
Really. I think that
my work here is done.

1411
01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.687
Oh.

1412
01:24:28.813 --> 01:24:31.232
We're going to celebrate.
I'm going to get some champagne.

1413
01:24:31.274 --> 01:24:33.651
Okay.
What are we toasting?

1414
01:24:33.693 --> 01:24:37.238
We are toasting, my dear,
to the dream job.

1415
01:24:38.531 --> 01:24:40.658
The one that a million girls wanted.

1416
01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:43.953
Which I got months ago.

1417
01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.791
I'm not talking about you.

1418
01:24:49.125 --> 01:24:50.543
Mm-hmm.

1419
01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.378
-James Holt--
-Yeah.

1420
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.964
Massimo Corteleoni...

1421
01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:58.885
...is investing in James's company
and taking it global.

1422
01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:03.306
-Mm-hmm.
-Bags, shoes, fragrances-- the works.

1423
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:07.519
And James needs a partner.

1424
01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:12.565
And that partner would be me.

1425
01:25:15.401 --> 01:25:17.987
-Does Miranda--
-No, no, Miranda knows, because--

1426
01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:19.405
-Oh.
-Oh, she put me up for it!

1427
01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:23.284
-God, no. Can you imagine?
-But-- But-- But you're leaving.

1428
01:25:23.326 --> 01:25:26.162
-Mm-hmm.
-I can't imagine<i> Runway</i> without you.

1429
01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:29.374
I know, I know,
but I'm so excited though.

1430
01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:32.001
This is the first time in 18 years I'm
going to be able

1431
01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:33.670
to call the shots in my own life.

1432
01:25:33.711 --> 01:25:35.046
Oh, my God!

1433
01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:40.093
I'm going to be able to come to Paris
and actually see Paris.

1434
01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:45.807
Well, congratulations.

1435
01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:48.893
-Huh? Oh.
-Nigel, you deserve it.

1436
01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:54.691
You bet your size-six ass.
(guffaws)

1437
01:25:54.732 --> 01:25:57.986
-Four.
-Really?

1438
01:25:58.027 --> 01:25:59.946
-(glasses clink)
-Cheers.

1439
01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:03.783
-Cheers to you.
-To us.

1440
01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.202
-Let me see that.
-(giggles)

1441
01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:09.789
(woman singing in French)

1442
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.583
Okay, I just wanna say that yes,

1443
01:26:11.624 --> 01:26:14.627
there are things Miranda does
that I don't agree with, but--

1444
01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:15.753
Come on. You hate her.

1445
01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:17.255
-Just admit it to me.
-No.

1446
01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:19.799
She's a--
She's a notorious sadist,

1447
01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.177
and not--
not in a good way.

1448
01:26:22.218 --> 01:26:25.555
Okay, she's tough,
but if Miranda were a man,

1449
01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:29.225
no one would notice anything about her,
except how great she is at her job.

1450
01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:33.146
(chuckles) I'm sorry. I can't--
I can't believe this.

1451
01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:35.440
-You're defending her?
-Yeah.

1452
01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:38.776
The wide-eyed girl peddling
her earnest newspaper stories?

1453
01:26:38.818 --> 01:26:42.071
You, my friend,
are crossing over to the dark side.

1454
01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.533
I resent that.

1455
01:26:45.575 --> 01:26:48.870
-You shouldn't. It's sexy.
-Sexy?

1456
01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:53.875
-Really?
-Really.

1457
01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:01.633
So do you--
do you know where we're going?

1458
01:27:01.674 --> 01:27:03.468
-'Cause I'm lost.
-Yeah.

1459
01:27:03.509 --> 01:27:06.095
Yeah, don't worry. I know this city
like the back of my hand.

1460
01:27:06.137 --> 01:27:09.265
It's my favorite place in the whole world.

1461
01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:11.309
You know, Gertrude Stein once said,

1462
01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:16.022
"America is my country,
and Paris is my hometown."

1463
01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:19.275
-(laughs)
-It's true.

1464
01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:22.320
What do you do?
Do you just write stuff like that down

1465
01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:25.990
and then file it away to use on us girls?

1466
01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:29.577
-I'm Christian Thompson. That's my way.
-That's your way. Right.

1467
01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:32.372
I work freelance.
I have a lot of free time on my hands.

1468
01:27:34.123 --> 01:27:36.876
You know, I never understood

1469
01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:39.963
why everyone was so crazy about Paris,

1470
01:27:40.004 --> 01:27:42.257
but...

1471
01:27:42.298 --> 01:27:45.468
it is so beautiful. (giggles)

1472
01:27:47.428 --> 01:27:52.684
Mm. I-I can't. I'm sorry. I can't.

1473
01:27:53.476 --> 01:27:56.479
You know, Nate and I just split up
a couple days ago, and I can't.

1474
01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:02.360
Ooh. I've had too much wine.

1475
01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:05.738
And my hearing-- vision--
judgment's impaired.

1476
01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:12.537
No, I barely know you.
I'm in a strange city.

1477
01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:18.876
I... am out of excuses.

1478
01:28:18.918 --> 01:28:20.378
Thank God.

1479
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:50.825
(groans)

1480
01:29:01.794 --> 01:29:03.004
(gasps)

1481
01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:10.678
Yes.

1482
01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:15.725
Oh, shoot.

1483
01:29:21.981 --> 01:29:24.692
(door opens)

1484
01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:26.861
<i>Bonjour, madame.</i>

1485
01:29:26.903 --> 01:29:29.530
Uh, what the hell is this?

1486
01:29:29.572 --> 01:29:32.867
What does it look like?
It's a mock-up.

1487
01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:35.078
Yeah. Of?

1488
01:29:35.119 --> 01:29:36.954
Of what<i> American Runway</i>
will look like

1489
01:29:36.996 --> 01:29:40.333
when Jacqueline Follet
is the new editor in chief.

1490
01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:43.544
Wh-- They're replacing Miranda?

1491
01:29:43.586 --> 01:29:47.465
Yeah. And she's bringing me in
to run all the editorial content.

1492
01:29:49.675 --> 01:29:51.052
You're really surprised?

1493
01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:55.807
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda.
She has a fresher take on things.

1494
01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:58.601
Not to mention<i> American Runway's</i>

1495
01:29:58.643 --> 01:30:01.270
one of the most expensive books
in the business.

1496
01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:04.482
Jacqueline does the same thing
for a lot less money.

1497
01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:09.237
And Irv--
Irv's a businessman, you know.

1498
01:30:09.278 --> 01:30:10.988
Miranda will be devastated.

1499
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:13.616
Her whole life is about<i> Runway.</i>
He can't do that to her.

1500
01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:17.161
It's done. Irv's gonna tell Miranda
after the party for James.

1501
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:19.330
And she has no idea?

1502
01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:21.249
She's a big girl. She'll be fine.

1503
01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:26.003
Shi--
I have to go.

1504
01:30:26.045 --> 01:30:27.588
Andy.

1505
01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:29.340
Andy, it's done.

1506
01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:32.927
Baby, it's done.

1507
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:36.013
I'm not your baby.

1508
01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:47.316
-(phone ringing)
-Allo.

1509
01:30:47.358 --> 01:30:49.819
Oh! Oh!
Thank God you're there.

1510
01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:52.655
-(sighs) Excuse me?
<i>-I need to talk to you right away.</i>

1511
01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:54.240
<i>It's about Jacqueline Follet.</i>

1512
01:30:55.074 --> 01:30:59.162
Shit! Oh, shit!
Shit, shit, shit!

1513
01:31:15.845 --> 01:31:18.181
-Yes.
-Oh, hello, um, Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry

1514
01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:22.643
-to bother you. I was wondering--
-Have you completely lost your mind?

1515
01:31:22.685 --> 01:31:26.898
-I need to talk to you.
-Do not disturb me again.

1516
01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:29.317
But, um, it's just for one--
Miranda!

1517
01:31:35.114 --> 01:31:36.824
(horn honks)

1518
01:31:48.085 --> 01:31:51.130
Miranda. Miranda.
Wait, I need to talk to you.

1519
01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:54.550
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet
the editor in chief of<i> Runway.</i>

1520
01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:56.969
Christian Thompson told me
he's gonna work for her.

1521
01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:59.388
Irv is going to tell you today,
so I thought maybe if I told you,

1522
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:02.266
-that you could fix it.
-Do I smell freesias?

1523
01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:06.395
What? No.
I-I specifically told them--

1524
01:32:06.437 --> 01:32:10.983
If I see freesias anywhere,

1525
01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:13.569
I will be very disappointed.

1526
01:32:14.403 --> 01:32:18.991
For 72 years,<i> Runway</i>
has been more than a magazine.

1527
01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:22.745
It has been a beacon
of elegance and grace.

1528
01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:28.209
Miranda Priestly is the finest possible
guardian of that beacon,

1529
01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:32.672
setting a standard that inspires people
across the globe.

1530
01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:37.718
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Miranda Priestly.

1531
01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:57.530
Thank you, my dear friend.

1532
01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:01.951
Bonjour.
(chuckles)

1533
01:33:01.993 --> 01:33:05.204
Thank you very much for coming today

1534
01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:09.792
to help celebrate
our dear friend, James Holt.

1535
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:21.220
But before I talk to you about James

1536
01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:23.556
and his many accomplishments,

1537
01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:28.936
I would like first
to share some news with you.

1538
01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:33.774
Um, as many of you know,

1539
01:33:33.816 --> 01:33:36.736
uh, recently Massimo Corteleoni

1540
01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:40.906
has agreed to finance the expansion
of the James Holt label,

1541
01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:44.994
transforming the work
of this visionary artist

1542
01:33:45.036 --> 01:33:49.582
into a global brand,
which is really an exciting enterprise.

1543
01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:53.127
<i>Runway</i> and James Holt
share many things in common,

1544
01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:56.964
chief among them,
a commitment to excellence.

1545
01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:02.094
And so, it should come as no surprise

1546
01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:04.263
that when the time came
for James to choose

1547
01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:06.766
the new president
of James Holt International,

1548
01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:09.769
he chose from within the<i> Runway</i> family.

1549
01:34:11.687 --> 01:34:14.774
And it's my great happiness today

1550
01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:17.485
to announce to you all that that person...

1551
01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:23.949
...is my friend and
longtime esteemed colleague...

1552
01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:26.077
...Jacqueline Follet.

1553
01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:40.883
Thank you.<i> Merci.</i>

1554
01:34:57.358 --> 01:35:00.111
And now to the main event,

1555
01:35:00.152 --> 01:35:03.614
our celebration of James Holt.

1556
01:35:03.656 --> 01:35:06.534
We at<i> Runway</i> are very proud
to have been--

1557
01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:10.246
When the time is right,
she'll pay me back.

1558
01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:14.875
You sure about that?

1559
01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.044
No.

1560
01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:20.131
But I hope for the best.

1561
01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.675
I have to.

1562
01:35:24.176 --> 01:35:26.721
(people clamoring)

1563
01:35:43.112 --> 01:35:44.780
You thought I didn't know.

1564
01:35:47.408 --> 01:35:51.120
I've known what was happening
for quite some time.

1565
01:35:52.371 --> 01:35:54.165
<i>It just took me a little while</i>

1566
01:35:54.206 --> 01:35:56.751
<i>to find a suitable alternative</i>
<i>for Jacqueline.</i>

1567
01:35:56.792 --> 01:36:02.131
And that James Holt job
was so absurdly overpaid

1568
01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:05.050
that, of course, she
jumped at it. (chuckles)

1569
01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:09.305
<i>So I just had to tell Irv that Jacqueline</i>
<i>was unavailable.</i>

1570
01:36:09.346 --> 01:36:13.809
The truth is, there is no one
that can do what I do,

1571
01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:15.311
including her.

1572
01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:18.272
Any of the other choices

1573
01:36:18.314 --> 01:36:20.483
would have found that job impossible,

1574
01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:22.318
and the magazine would have suffered.

1575
01:36:22.359 --> 01:36:25.946
(sighs)
Especially because of the list.

1576
01:36:27.573 --> 01:36:31.410
The list of designers,
photographers,

1577
01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:35.414
<i>editors, writers, models, all of whom</i>
<i>were found by me, nurtured by me</i>

1578
01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:38.292
and have promised me
they will follow me

1579
01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:41.587
whenever and if ever
I choose to leave<i> Runway.</i>

1580
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:43.589
(chuckles)

1581
01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:45.841
<i>So he reconsidered.</i>

1582
01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:52.598
But I was very, very impressed

1583
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.142
by how intently you tried to warn me.

1584
01:36:55.893 --> 01:36:58.854
I never thought
I would say this, Andrea,

1585
01:36:58.896 --> 01:37:00.481
but I really--

1586
01:37:02.775 --> 01:37:05.152
I see a great deal of myself in you.

1587
01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:12.535
You can see beyond what people want
and what they need,

1588
01:37:12.576 --> 01:37:14.912
and you can choose for yourself.

1589
01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.918
I don't think I'm like that.

1590
01:37:22.294 --> 01:37:23.796
I--

1591
01:37:27.758 --> 01:37:29.552
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel,
Miranda.

1592
01:37:29.593 --> 01:37:31.095
I couldn't do something like that.

1593
01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:36.016
Mm. You already did.

1594
01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.730
To Emily.

1595
01:37:42.398 --> 01:37:43.524
That's not what I--

1596
01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:48.404
No, that was-- that was different.
I didn't have a choice.

1597
01:37:48.445 --> 01:37:51.657
Oh, no, you chose.
You chose to get ahead.

1598
01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:56.412
You want this life,
those choices are necessary.

1599
01:37:56.453 --> 01:38:01.125
But what if... this isn't what I want?

1600
01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:05.212
I mean, what if I don't
want to live the way you live?

1601
01:38:05.254 --> 01:38:08.799
Don't be ridiculous, Andrea.
Everybody wants this.

1602
01:38:10.634 --> 01:38:13.220
Everybody wants to be us.

1603
01:38:19.852 --> 01:38:22.521
(reporters clamoring)

1604
01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:25.024
<i>(mid-tempo music playing)</i>

1605
01:39:03.312 --> 01:39:05.064
(cell phone ringing)

1606
01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:42.184
I have to be at work in 20 minutes.

1607
01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:45.521
What's up?

1608
01:39:47.022 --> 01:39:48.857
Well, I just--

1609
01:39:50.567 --> 01:39:53.195
I wanted to say that
you were right about everything.

1610
01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:55.531
That...

1611
01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:59.326
...I turned my back on my friends
and my family

1612
01:39:59.368 --> 01:40:04.665
and everything I believed in,
and-- and for what?

1613
01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:09.670
For shoes and shirts
and jackets and belts.

1614
01:40:09.712 --> 01:40:10.921
Nate.

1615
01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:16.677
I'm sorry.

1616
01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:27.396
I-- (clears throat)

1617
01:40:27.438 --> 01:40:29.815
I flew up to Boston
while you were gone.

1618
01:40:30.941 --> 01:40:32.526
I interviewed at the Oak Room.

1619
01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:35.070
And?

1620
01:40:36.155 --> 01:40:39.074
And you're looking
at their new sous-chef.

1621
01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:43.078
-I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
-That's great. Congratulations.

1622
01:40:48.417 --> 01:40:51.920
I don't know what I'm gonna do without
those late-night grilled cheeses, but--

1623
01:40:51.962 --> 01:40:56.091
I'm pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.

1624
01:40:56.133 --> 01:40:58.135
May even have Jarlsberg.

1625
01:41:01.472 --> 01:41:03.974
We might be able
to figure something out.

1626
01:41:05.809 --> 01:41:07.144
You think?

1627
01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:09.688
Yeah.

1628
01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:20.449
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?

1629
01:41:20.491 --> 01:41:23.911
Actually, I, uh-- I have
a job interview today.

1630
01:41:23.952 --> 01:41:25.162
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hm.

1631
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:27.831
That's what you're wearing?

1632
01:41:28.707 --> 01:41:30.542
Shut up. I like this.

1633
01:41:35.756 --> 01:41:37.758
-Andy, Greg Hill.
-Hello.

1634
01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:40.385
Come on.
These clips are excellent.

1635
01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:43.388
This thing on the Janitors' Union,
that's exactly what we do here.

1636
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:46.308
My only question is,<i> Runway?</i>

1637
01:41:47.309 --> 01:41:49.061
You were there for less than a year.

1638
01:41:49.103 --> 01:41:51.313
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

1639
01:41:52.314 --> 01:41:54.233
Learned a lot.

1640
01:41:56.276 --> 01:42:00.572
In the end, though,
I kind of... screwed it up.

1641
01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:05.035
I, uh, called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl.

1642
01:42:05.077 --> 01:42:08.705
Next thing you know,
I got a fax from Miranda Priestly herself,

1643
01:42:08.747 --> 01:42:11.250
saying that of all the assistants
she's ever had,

1644
01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:13.627
you were, by far,
her biggest disappointment.

1645
01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:17.339
And, if I don't hire you,

1646
01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:18.882
I am an idiot.

1647
01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:22.970
You must have done something right.

1648
01:42:51.665 --> 01:42:55.002
-(beeping)
-(phone ringing)

1649
01:42:56.128 --> 01:42:58.005
Miranda Priestly's office.

1650
01:42:58.046 --> 01:42:59.756
Hey, Emily, it's Andy.

1651
01:42:59.798 --> 01:43:03.135
<i>Don't hang up.</i>
<i>I have a favor to ask you.</i>

1652
01:43:03.177 --> 01:43:05.345
You have a favor to ask of me?

1653
01:43:05.387 --> 01:43:09.433
Yeah. The thing is, I have
all these clothes from Paris,

1654
01:43:09.474 --> 01:43:11.643
and I don't have anyplace
to wear them,

1655
01:43:11.685 --> 01:43:15.230
so I was wondering
if you could take them off my hands.

1656
01:43:20.068 --> 01:43:24.156
Well, I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.

1657
01:43:24.198 --> 01:43:27.034
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they'll drown me.

1658
01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:30.120
But I suppose I could help you out.

1659
01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:33.081
I will have Roy pick them up
this afternoon.

1660
01:43:33.123 --> 01:43:37.836
Thanks, Em.
I appreciate it. Good luck.

1661
01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:50.724
You have some very
large shoes to fill.

1662
01:43:51.642 --> 01:43:52.935
I hope you know that.

1663
01:43:59.691 --> 01:44:03.070
I don't understand
why it is so challenging...

1664
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:06.281
to get my car when I ask for it.

1665
01:44:47.698 --> 01:44:49.533
(chuckles)

1666
01:44:51.994 --> 01:44:53.287
Go.
