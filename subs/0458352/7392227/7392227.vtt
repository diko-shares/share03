Hi. Uh, I have an appointment
with Emily Charlton?

- Andrea Sachs?
- Yes.

15
00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:48.817
Great. Human Resources certainly

Follow me.

17
00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.133
Okay, so I was Miranda's
second assistant...

18
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.363

and so now I'm the first.

00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:00.769
- Oh, and you're replacing yourself.
- Well, I am trying.

20
00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.273
Miranda sacked the last two girls

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:05.776
We need to find someone who can survive here.
Do you understand?

30

to confirm an appointment.

48
00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:33.826
I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda.
I actually did confirm last night.

49
00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.053
Details of your incompetence
do not interest me.

50
00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:39.996
Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl
that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.

51
00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.660
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling.
She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.

52

And R.S.V.P. Yes
to the Michael Kors party.

53
00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:49.831

and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:54.174
- [Whispers] 9:45 sharp.
- Call Natalie at Glorious Foods,

No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes

56
00:06:57.483 --> 00:07:00.782

parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.

57
00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:05.347
Then call my husband, ask him to meet me
for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.

58
00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:10.122
Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent
for that feature on the female paratroopers...

59
00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.026
and they're all so deeply unattractive.

60
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:15.328
Is it impossible to find a lovely,
slender female paratrooper?

61
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.166
- No.
- Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.

64
00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:29.511
Nobody. Um, uh-

65
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:33.949
Human Resources sent her up about the new
assistant job, and I was preinterviewing her.

66
00:07:34.053 --> 00:07:36.954
But she's hopeless
and totally wrong for it.

67
00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:39.957
Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself
because the last two you sent me...

68

<i>were completely inadequate.</i>

69
00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:45.462

70
00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:48.734

from Northwestern University.

78
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.026

[Clears Throat]

79
00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:24.592

<i>And, um-</i>

81
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.406
Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist
and sent letters out everywhere...

82
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.776
and then finally got a call
from Elias-Clarke...

83
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:37.509
<i>and met with Sherry
up at Human Resources.</i>

84
00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:40.950

<i>- So you don't read Runway?
- Uh, no.</i>

86
00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:49.085
<i>And before today,
you had never heard of me.</i>

87
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.095
No.

88
00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.360
And you have no style
or sense of fashion.

89
00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:59.268
Well, um, I think that depends
on what you're-

90
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.739
No, no. That wasn't a question.

91
00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:09.239
<i>Um, I was editor in chief

97
00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:29.601
You're right. I don't fit in here.

98
00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.830
I am not skinny or glamorous...

99
00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.134

100

<i>But I'm smart.</i>

101
00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:39.868
I learn fast
and I will work very hard.

102
00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:42.447
I got the exclusive
on the Cavalli for Gwyneth...

103
00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:45.915
but the problem is, with that huge
feathered headdress that she's wearing...

104
00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:48.612
she looks like she's working
the main stage at the Golden Nugget.

105
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:52.452
Thank you for your time.

106
00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:55.391

- What? No.

186
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.917
I get to go with her to Paris
for Fashion Week in the fall.

187
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.148

Don't touch it. She returns it to us
in the morning with her notes.

195

Now, the second assistant
is supposed to do this...

196

and she does not like strangers in her house.

328
00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:21.064
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic.
- We need more, don't we?

329
00:22:21.173 --> 00:22:25.075
- Oh. This is-This might be-
What do you think of-
- Yeah.

330
00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:26.735
<i>Well, you know me.</i>

331
00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.712
Give me a full ballerina skirt
and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.

332
00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:33.251
<i>- But do you think it's too much like-
- Like the Lacroix from July?</i>

333
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:36.287
I thought that, but no, not with
the right accessories. It should work.

334
00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:40.916
Where are the belts for this dre-
Why is no one ready?

335
00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:44.325
Here. It's a tough call.

336
00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:46.590
<i>- They're so different.
- [Miranda] Hmm.</i>

337
00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:48.757
[Snorts, Chuckles]

338
00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:53.566
Something funny?

339
00:22:57.175 --> 00:23:00.144
No. No, no. Nothing's-

340
00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:04.113
You know, it's just that both those belts
look exactly the same to me.

341
00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:08.380
You know, I'm still learning
about this stuff and, uh-

342
00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:11.251
"This... stuff"?

343
00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:14.917
<i>Oh. Okay. I see.</i>

344
00:23:15.026 --> 00:23:17.221
You think this has nothing
to do with you.

345
00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:20.662
<i>You go to your closet...</i>

346
00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:25.430
and you select- I don't know-
that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...

347
00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:28.404
<i>because you're trying to tell the world
that you take yourself too seriously...</i>

348
00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:30.873
to care about what
you put on your back.

349
00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:34.104
But what you don't know
is that that sweater is not just blue.

350
00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:36.737
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.

351
00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:39.009
It's actually cerulean.

352
00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:41.176
And you're also blithely unaware
of the fact...

353
00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:45.586
<i>that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta
did a collection of cerulean gowns.</i>

354
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.215
<i>And then I think it was
Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it-</i>

355
00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:50.294
who showed cerulean military jackets?

356
00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:52.795
- I think we need a jacket here.
- Mmm.

357
00:23:52.898 --> 00:23:56.698
<i>And then cerulean quickly showed up
in the collections of eight different designers.</i>

358
00:23:56.802 --> 00:24:00.033
<i>And then it, uh, filtered down
through the department stores...</i>

359
00:24:00.138 --> 00:24:01.139
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

360
00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:04.199
and then trickled on down
into some tragic Casual Corner...

361
00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:07.437
<i>where you, no doubt,
fished it out of some clearance bin.</i>

362
00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:10.208
<i>However, that blue represents
millions of dollars...</i>

363
00:24:10.315 --> 00:24:12.783
and countless jobs...

364
00:24:12.884 --> 00:24:15.910
and it's sort of comical how you think
that you've made a choice...

365
00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:17.989
that exempts you
from the fashion industry...

366
00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:19.989
when, in fact...

367
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:24.494
you're wearing a sweater that was selected
for you by the people in this room...

368
00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:27.326
from a pile of stuff.

369
00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:30.059
<i>So then I said,
"No, I couldn't see the difference...</i>

370
00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.466
<i>between the two
absolutely identical belts"...</i>

371
00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:34.539
and you should have seen
the look she gave me!

372
00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.698
I thought the flesh
was gonna melt off her face.

373
00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:39.368
<i>- [Chuckles]
- It's not funny.</i>

374
00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:43.676
She's not happy unless everyone around her
is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

375
00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:46.717
And the Clackers just worship her.

376
00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:48.718
<i>- The who?
- They call them Clackers.</i>

377
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.119
The sound that their stilettos make
in the marble lobby.

378
00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:54.192
It's like,
"Clack, clack, clack. Clack, clack."

379
00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:58.023
<i>[Groans] And they all act like
they're curing cancer or something.</i>

380
00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:01.690
[Chuckling]
The amount of time and energy...

381
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.203
<i>that these people spend on these insignificant,
minute details, and for what?</i>

382
00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:09.899
So that tomorrow they can spend
another $300,000 reshooting something...

383
00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.999
<i>that was probably fine to begin with...</i>

384
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.908
to sell people things they don't need!

385
00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:18.073
God!

386
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.414
<i>- I'm not even hungry anymore.
- What?</i>

387
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.421
<i>- That is why those girls are so skinny.
- Oh. No, no, no.</i>

388
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:27.014
Give me that. There's, like,
eight dollars ofJarlsberg in there.

389
00:25:27.125 --> 00:25:30.151
[Sighs]
You know what?

390
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.355
I just have to stick it out for a year.
One year.

391
00:25:34.466 --> 00:25:37.094
And then I can do
what I came to New York to do.

392
00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:40.467
But I can't let Miranda get to me.
I won't.

393
00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:42.540
Easy there, tiger.

394
00:25:44.075 --> 00:25:46.873
- Oh, good morning, Miranda.
- Get me Isaac.

395
00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:51.877
<i>I don't see my breakfast here.
Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?</i>

396
00:25:51.983 --> 00:25:53.644
Excuse me!

397
00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:56.778
<i>Pick up the Polaroids
from the lingerie shoot.</i>

398
00:25:56.888 --> 00:26:00.415
<i>Have the brakes checked on my car.</i>

<i>- [Truck Horn Honking]

400
00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:06.125
Where's that piece of paper
I had in my hand yesterday morning?

401
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:11.168
<i>The girls need new surfboards or
boogie boards or something for spring break.</i>

402
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:14.500
- Hello.
- The twins also need flip-flops.

403
00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:17.503
- Ow!
- Oh, my gosh!

404
00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:21.636
<i>Pick up my shoes from Blahnik,
and then go get Patricia.</i>

405
00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:24.579
- Who's that?
- Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

406
00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:28.414
Get me that little table
that I liked at that store on Madison.

407
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.648
<i>Get us a reservation for dinner tonight
at that place that got the good review.</i>

408
00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:34.418
<i>- Get me Isaac.
- Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today.</i>

409
00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:36.517
<i>- Where is everyone?
- Why is no one working?</i>

410
00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:39.324
<i>[Miranda's Voice Overlapping]</i>

411
00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:41.763
Get me Demarchelier.

412
00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:50.607
I have Miranda Priestly calling for-
Okay.

413
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:54.579
I have Patrick.

414
00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:02.118
[Sighs]
Thank God it's Friday, right?

415
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.816
<i>At least Miranda will be in Miami,
so we don't have to be on call this weekend.</i>

416
00:27:06.925 --> 00:27:08.893
You know,
my dad's coming in from Ohio.

417
00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:11.622
<i>Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner,
maybe see Chicago.</i>

418
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.789
You doing anything fun this weekend?

419
00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:16.230
Yes.

<i>[Andy]
Yeah, Nate said it was great.</i>

422
00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:26.175
He actually- He applied here, but they
wanted someone with more experience.

423
00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:28.177
- Here.
- Huh? What's this?

424
00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:31.077
I don't want you
to get behind on your rent.

425
00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:34.049
- Dad, how did you-
- It's-

426
00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:37.019
I'm gonna kill Mom.
[Chuckles]

427
00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:39.090
Dad, thank you.

428
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.885
Mm-hmm.

429
00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:47.256
- It's really good to see you.
- You too, honey.

430
00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:50.300
So, you want to
start grilling me now...

431
00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.597
or should we wait till after dinner?

432
00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:55.935
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy
the bread basket first.

433
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.838
No, no, no. It's okay.
Go right ahead.

434
00:27:57.942 --> 00:28:00.376
We're just a little worried, honey.

435
00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:03.106
We get e-mails from you
at your office at 2:00 a.m.

436
00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:05.944
Your pay is terrible.
You don't get to write anything.

437
00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:08.042
Hey, that's not fair.

438
00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:10.485
I wrote those e-mails.

439
00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:13.887
I'm just trying to understand why someone
who got accepted to Stanford Law...

440
00:28:13.992 --> 00:28:17.792
turns it down to be a journalist,
and now you're not even doing that.

441
00:28:17.896 --> 00:28:21.024
Dad, you have to trust me.

442
00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:23.896
Being Miranda's assistant
opens a lot of doors.

443
00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:27.563
Emily is going to Paris
with Miranda in a few months...

444
00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:31.472
and she's gonna meet editors and writers
from every important magazine.

445
00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:33.544
And in a year, that could be me.

446
00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:36.113
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

447
00:28:36.214 --> 00:28:38.910

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.124

- My flight has been canceled.

452
00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:55.426
It's some absurd weather problem.

453
00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:59.435
I need to get home tonight. The twins have
a recital tomorrow morning at school.

454
00:28:59.537 --> 00:29:01.437
- What?
- At school!

455
00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:03.803
- Absolutely. Let me see what I can do.
- Good.

456
00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.843
Hi. Um, I know this
is totally last minute...

457
00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:09.846
but I was hoping that you
could maybe get a flight for my boss...

458
00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:11.916
from Miami to New York tonight?

459
00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:13.916
Uh-

460
00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:16.282
<i>- [Dad] It's right here. Thank you.

- Thank you.

462
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:20.289
- Yup, I need it tonight. I need it-
- Ow!

463
00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:22.325
- I thought you were going out the other-
- Sweetie! No.

464
00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:24.327
- It's over here, honey.
- Tonight.

465
00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:29.264
<i>Hi. I'm trying to get a flight tonight-
for tonight- from Miami to New York.</i>

466
00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:32.666
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.

467
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.433
Nothing is flying out?
What do you mean, nothing is flying out?

468
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.998
It's for Miranda Priestly,
and I know that she's a client of yours.

469
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.342
Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight
from Miami to New York.

470
00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:47.282
Yeah. Sorry. Hold on.
Hello? Miranda, hi.

471
00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:50.946
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one
is flying out because of the weather.

472
00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:54.024
Please. It's just-
I don't know- drizzling.

473
00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.719
<i>- [Thunderclap]

474
00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:58.728
Call Donatella. Get her jet.

475
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.298

Get me home.

478
00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:08.867
Oh, my God!
She's going to murder me.

479
00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:12.602
What does she want you to do, call the National
Guard and have her airlifted out of there?

480
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.735
Of course not. Could I do that?

481
00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.074
Come on.

482
00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:18.078
Come on.

483
00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:21.550
The girls' recital
was absolutely wonderful.

484
00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.848
They played Rachmaninoff.
Everyone loved it.

485
00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:26.116
Everyone except me...

486
00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:30.354

487

Do you know why I hired you?

489
00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:38.060
I always hire the same girl-

490
00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:41.605
stylish, slender, of course...

491

494
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.281

652
00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:19.699
[Clicks Tongue] Very nice, indeed.
Who made that fantastic thing?

653
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.801
You.

654
00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:25.905
Hmm. Duh. This way.

655
00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:30.813
Uh, here we go.

656
00:41:30.921 --> 00:41:33.253
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress
for the benefit.

657
00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:36.326
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection.
Top secret stuff.

658
00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:38.554
- I'll guard it with my life.
- Please do.

659
00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:40.960
Come on.
You're working for Miranda Priestly now.

660
00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:45.764
You must be in desperate need
of hard liquor.

661
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.100
Excuse us, girls.

662
00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:50.264
She'll have the punch.

[Clears Throat]

664
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:55.843

- He's right, you know.
- Hmm?

667
00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:06.789
The punch.
I drank it atJames's last party.

668
00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:10.588
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing
but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

669

<i>- [Continues]
- Ah. Well.</i>

670
00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:16.395
- Wise.
- [Chuckling]

671
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.469
- Uh, hi.
- Christian Thompson.

672
00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:23.170
Christian Thompson?
You're kidding.

673
00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:26.869
No, you're-You write for,
like, every magazine I love.

674
00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:30.435
I actually- I reviewed your collection
of essays for my college newspaper.

675
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:34.484
Did you mention my good looks
and my killer charm?

676
00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:36.815
- No, but-
- What do you do?

677
00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:41.483
<i>Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere
like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.</i>

678
00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:43.560
- I am a writer too.
- Is that right?

679
00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:46.755
- Mm-hmm.
- I should read your stuff.
Why don't you send it over?

680
00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:49.196
Yeah?

681
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.963
That would be-Thank you.
That would be great. [Giggling]

682
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:56.471
But actually, right now, I'm working
as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

683
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:58.974
Oh, you're kidding.
Well, that's too bad.

684
00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:03.012
That's-Whoa.
You'll never survive Miranda.

685
00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:08.014
- Excuse me?
- Well, you seem nice, smart.

686
00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:10.245
You can't do that job.

687
00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:14.114
Gotta go.

688
00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:16.124
Okay.

689
00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:19.855
Well, it was very, very nice
to meet you, Miranda girl.

690
00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.746

691
00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:49.153
<i>Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want
to move the preview up to today at 12:30.</i>

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:52.057
Tell everybody else.
Be ready to leave in half an hour.

693
00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:55.825
<i>But we're not expected until Tuesday.
Did she say why?</i>

694
00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:58.731
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail
of her decision making.

695
00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:01.805
<i>And then we brushed each other's hair
and gabbed about American Idol.</i>

696
00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:03.805
I see your point.

697
00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:06.273
<i>- [Andy] What's a preview anyway?
- Good morning, Miranda.</i>

698

<i>[Nigel] Miranda insists upon seeing
all the designers'collections...</i>

<i>before they show them.</i>

700
00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:13.349
- Great to see you.
- Hello, James.

701
00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.419
<i>- [Andy] And she tells them what she thinks?
- [Nigel] In her way.</i>

702
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.012
Uh, this season really began for me
with a meditation...

703
00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:22.752
<i>on the intersection
between East and West.</i>

704
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.352
<i>[Nigel] There's a scale.
One nod is good. Two nods is very good.</i>

705
00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:30.593
<i>There's only been one actual smile on record,
and that was Tom Ford in 2001.</i>

706
00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:32.669
An obi belt.

707
00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.863
<i>[Nigel]
She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.</i>

708
00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:38.738
This is the dress that we have designed
specifically and exclusively for you.

709
00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:41.709
<i>[Nigel] Then, of course,
there's the pursing of the lips.</i>

710
00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:43.677
<i>[Andy]
Which means?</i>

711
00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:49.718
<i>[Nigel]
Catastrophe.</i>

712
00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:53.051
[Whispers]
Just, uh-Just go.

713
00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:56.854
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled.
- It's absurd. Appalled.

714
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.224
- You deal with it.
- I'll talk to him.

715
00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:03.493
So because she pursed her lips,
he's gonna change his entire collection?

716
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.568
You still don't get it, do you?

717
00:45:05.669 --> 00:45:08.638
Her opinion is the only one
that matters.

718
00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:13.701
- Call my husband and confirm dinner.
- At Pastis? Done.

719
00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:15.779
And I'll need a change of clothes.

720
00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:20.873
Well, I've already messengered
your outfit over to the shoot.

721
00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:25.648
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you
to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

722
00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:28.247
- Have Emily give you the key.
- Mm-hmm.

723
00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:32.890
- Guard this with your life.
- Of course.

724
00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:38.894
You know, if I can deliver the Book,
that means I must have done something right.

725
00:45:39.002 --> 00:45:40.902
I'm not a psycho.

726
00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:43.495
Oh, and, you know,
she called me Andrea?

727
00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:46.235
I mean, she didn't call me Emily,
which is- Isn't that great?

728
00:45:46.343 --> 00:45:48.903
Yeah, whoopee. Right.

729
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:54.942
Now, it's very important that you do
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

730
00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.986
Oh. Okay.

731
00:45:57.087 --> 00:46:00.284
<i>[Emily]
The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30...</i>

732

<i>and you must wait around for it
until then.</i>

733
00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:07.421
You will be delivering Miranda's
dry cleaning with the Book.

734
00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:13.494
<i>Now, the car will take you straight
to Miranda's townhouse.</i>

735
00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.004
<i>You let yourself in.</i>

736
00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:21.738
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.

737
00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.904
Do not look at anyone.

738
00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:26.642
This is of the utmost importance.
You must be invisible.

739
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:29.014
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.

740
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:32.555
<i>You open the door
and you walk across the foyer.</i>

741
00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:37.286
<i>You hang the dry cleaning
in the closet across from the staircase.</i>

742
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:47.828
<i>- Uh-
- And you leave the Book
on the table with the flowers.</i>

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.642
Okay.

00:47:11.061 --> 00:47:14.155
[Whispers]
Thank you.

747
00:47:14.264 --> 00:47:18.257
- You can give the Book to us.
- Shh. Which-Which table?

748
00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:20.928
<i>- It's okay. Come on up.
- No, I can't. I can't.</i>

- Come on.

750
00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:25.675
<i>- Yeah, come on. It's okay.
- Please stop talking.</i>

751
00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:29.371
Or you can bring the Book upstairs.
Emily does it all the time.

752
00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:33.415
She does? Right.
She does, all the time.

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:36.577

an investment committee meeting...</i>

for almost an hour.

- Okay, okay! Okay, okay.
- Oh, no. Shh!

762
00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:28.431
It really wasn't that big a deal.
I promise.

763
00:48:28.538 --> 00:48:31.006
The twins said hello,
so I said hello back.

764

- Then I went up the stairs
to give her the Book and-
- You went upstairs?

765
00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:38.978
Oh, my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed
with her and ask for a bedtime story?

766
00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:42.074
Okay, I made a mistake. I know.

767
00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:43.846
Andrea, you don't understand.

768
00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:46.923
If you get fired,
that might jeopardize Paris for me.

769
00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:51.085
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's
in the tristate area until I track you down.

770
00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:53.162
She's gonna fire me?

771
00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:56.198

I need the new Harry Potter book

00:49:13.481 --> 00:49:16.939
Okay. Okay. I'll go down

Not that I can recall.

It's for Miranda Priestly.

Yes, I know it's impossible to get...

01:40:14.103 --> 01:40:16.003
I'm sorry.

1465
01:40:24.113 --> 01:40:26.343
L-
[Clears Throat]

1466
01:40:26.448 --> 01:40:28.609
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.

1467
01:40:28.717 --> 01:40:31.311
I interviewed at the Oak Room.

1468
01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.854
And?

1469
01:40:35.157 --> 01:40:37.921
And you're looking
at their new sous-chef.

1470
01:40:38.026 --> 01:40:41.860
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks.
- That's great. Congratulations.

1471
01:40:47.302 --> 01:40:50.760
I don't know what I'm gonna do without
those late-night grilled cheeses, but-

1472
01:40:50.873 --> 01:40:54.934
I'm pretty sure
they have bread in Boston.

1473
01:40:55.043 --> 01:40:57.273
<i>May even haveJarlsberg.</i>

1474
01:41:00.482 --> 01:41:02.780
We might be able
to figure something out.

1475
01:41:04.953 --> 01:41:06.853
You think?

1476
01:41:06.955 --> 01:41:08.855
Yeah.

1477
01:41:15.764 --> 01:41:19.291
So, what about you?
I mean, what are you gonna do now?

1478
01:41:19.401 --> 01:41:22.734
Actually, I, uh-
I have a job interview today.

1479
01:41:22.838 --> 01:41:25.272
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1480
01:41:25.374 --> 01:41:27.638
That's what you're wearing?

1481
01:41:27.743 --> 01:41:30.678
Shut up. I like this.

1482
01:41:34.816 --> 01:41:36.716
- Andy, Greg Hill.
- Hello.

1483
01:41:36.818 --> 01:41:39.218
Come on. These clips are excellent.

1484
01:41:39.321 --> 01:41:42.222
This thing on the janitors' union,
that's exactly what we do here.

1485
01:41:42.324 --> 01:41:44.159
<i>My only question is, Runway?</i>

1486
01:41:44.159 --> 01:41:45.285
<i>My only question is, Runway?</i>

1487
01:41:45.394 --> 01:41:48.022
You were there for less than a year.

1488
01:41:48.130 --> 01:41:50.098
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

1489
01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.391
Learned a lot.

1490
01:41:55.270 --> 01:42:00.264
In the end though,
I kind of screwed it up.

1491
01:42:00.375 --> 01:42:03.867
I called over there for a reference,
left word with some snooty girl.

1492
01:42:03.979 --> 01:42:07.540
<i>Next thing you know, I got a fax
from Miranda Priestly herself...</i>

1493
01:42:07.649 --> 01:42:10.174
saying that of all the assistants
she's ever had...

1494
01:42:10.285 --> 01:42:12.515
you were, by far,
her biggest disappointment.

1495
01:42:12.621 --> 01:42:17.786
<i>And, if I don't hire you,
I am an idiot.</i>

1496
01:42:20.329 --> 01:42:22.923
You must have done something right.

1497
01:42:50.726 --> 01:42:53.786
<i>- [Beeping]
- [Phone Ringing]</i>

1498
01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:56.830
Miranda Priestly's office.

1499
01:42:56.932 --> 01:43:02.131
Hey, Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up.
I have a favor to ask you.

1500
01:43:02.237 --> 01:43:05.001
You have a favor to ask of me?

1501
01:43:05.107 --> 01:43:08.372
Yeah. The thing is,
I have all these clothes from Paris...

1502
01:43:08.477 --> 01:43:10.502
and I don't have anyplace
to wear them...

1503
01:43:10.612 --> 01:43:14.742
so I was wondering if you
could take them off my hands.

1504
01:43:19.054 --> 01:43:23.047
Well, I don't know.
It's a huge imposition.

1505
01:43:23.158 --> 01:43:27.356
And I'll have to get them taken in.
I mean, they'll drown me.

1506
01:43:27.462 --> 01:43:31.922
But I suppose I could help you out.
I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

1507
01:43:32.034 --> 01:43:36.630
Thanks, Em. I appreciate it.
Good luck.

1508
01:43:46.548 --> 01:43:49.608
You have some very large shoes to fill.

1509
01:43:49.718 --> 01:43:53.176
I hope you know that.

1510
01:43:58.593 --> 01:44:02.051
I don't understand
why it is so challenging...

1511
01:44:02.164 --> 01:44:05.759
to get my car when I ask for it.

1512
01:44:46.775 --> 01:44:48.675
[Chuckles]

1513
01:44:51.146 --> 01:44:53.137
Go.
