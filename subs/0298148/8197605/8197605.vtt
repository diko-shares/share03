00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:58.975
<i>Once upon a time
in a kingdom far, faraway,</i>

2
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.604
<i>the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.</i>

3
00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.066
<i>And throughout the land,
everyone was happy</i>

4
00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.194
<i>until the sun went down</i>

5
00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:13.281
<i>and they saw that their daughter
was cursed with a frightful enchantment</i>

6
00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:16.076
<i>that took hold each and every night.</i>

7
00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:21.748
<i>Desperate, they sought the help
of a fairy god mother</i>

8
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.626
<i>who had them lock the young princess
away in a tower,</i>

9
00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.255
<i>there to await the kiss
of the handsome Prince Charming.</i>

10
00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.177
<i>It was he who would chance
the perilous journey</i>

11
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.472
<i>through blistering cold
and scorching desert,</i>

12
00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.891
<i>traveling for many days and nights,</i>

13
00:01:39.975 --> 00:01:41.726
<i>risking life and limb</i>

14
00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.021
<i>to reach the Dragon's Keep.</i>

15
00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.945
For he was the bravest

16
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.073
and most handsome...

17
00:01:58.285 --> 00:01:59.869
in all the land.

18
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.914
And it was destiny that his kiss

19
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.002
would break the dreaded curse.

20
00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:12.215
He alone would climb to the highest room
of the tallest tower

21
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:18.013
to enter the princess's chambers,
cross the room to her sleeping silhouette,

22
00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.056
pull back the gossamer curtains
to find her--

23
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:22.767
What?

24
00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:26.438
-Princess Fiona?
-No!

25
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.607
Oh, thank heavens. Where is she?

26
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:30.900
She's on her honeymoon.

27
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.445

Shrek! Fiona!

61
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.357
Well, aren't you two
a sight for sore eyes!

62
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.568
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

63
00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.114
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How about a side of sugar for the steed?

64
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.408
Donkey, what are you doing here?

65
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.535
I was just taking care of
your love nest for you.

66
00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:32.290
Oh, you mean like sorting the mail
and watering the plants.

67
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:33.625
Yeah, and feeding the fish.

68
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.959
I don't have any fish.

69
00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:38.171
You do now.
I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.

70
00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.673
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

71
00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.801
Oh, will you look at the time.
Well, I guess you'd better be going.

72
00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.553
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?

73
00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.223
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

74
00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:52.227
Actually, Donkey?
Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon?

75
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.978
Oh, yeah, that.

76
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.066
I don't know. She's been
all moody and stuff lately.

77
00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.068
So I thought I'd move back in
with you guys.

78
00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.862
Well, you know we're always happy
to see you, Donkey.

79
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.573
But Fiona and I are married now.

80
00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.826
We need a little time, you know,
to be together.

81
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.205
Just with each other.

82
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:15.542
Alone.

83
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.253
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.

84
00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.297
I will always be here to make sure
nobody bothers you.

85
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.091
-Donkey!
-Yes, roomie?

86
00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.509
You're bothering me.

87
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:28.680
Oh, okay. Uh, all right, cool.
I guess, uh...

88
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.267
Me and Pinocchio was just going
to try to catch a tournament, anyway.

89
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.354
So, uh, maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

90
00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:43.611
He'll be fine. Now, where were we?

91
00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:46.781
Ooh. I think I remember.

92
00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:50.994
Donkey!

93
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:54.330
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.

94
00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.040
But what do you want me
to tell these guys?

95
00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:09.679
Enough, Reggie.

96
00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:16.144
"Dearest Princess Fiona.

97
00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:20.440
You are hereby summoned
to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away

98
00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:24.444
for a royal ball
in celebration of your marriage

99
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.613
at which time the King

100
00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:32.076
will bestow his royal blessing upon you
and your, uh--

101
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.953
Uh, Prince Charming.

102
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:38.791
Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away.

103
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.210
Aka Mom and Dad."

104
00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.670
Mom and Dad?

105
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:46.132
-Prince Charming?
-Royal ball? Can I come?

106
00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:48.009
- We're not going.
- What?

107
00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:50.928
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit

108
00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:54.140
shocked to see you like this?

109
00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:56.851
Well, they might be a bit surprised.

110
00:07:56.934 --> 00:08:00.021
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

111
00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:02.315
And don't worry.
They're gonna love you too.

112
00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:06.235
Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think
I'll be welcome at the country club.

113
00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.112
Will you stop it. They're not like that.

114
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.783
Then how do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

115
00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:15.203
Oh, come on! You could at least
give them a chance.

116
00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:17.288
Oh, to do what? Sharpen their pitchforks?

117
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.249
No! They just want
to give you their blessing.

118
00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:24.420
Oh, great. Now I need their blessing?

119
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.964
Well, if you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

120
00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.092
And who says
I want to be part of this family?

121
00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:32.178
Uh, you did! When you married me!

122
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.347
Well, there's some fine print for you!

123
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.475
So-- So that's it.
You won't come?

124
00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:42.647
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going and that's final!

125
00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:47.151
Hey, come on, Shrek!
We don't want to hit traffic!

126
00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.615
Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.

127
00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:55.702

That's not funny.

148
00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.310
That's really immature.

149
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.062
This is why nobody likes ogres.

150
00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:06.397
All right! Your loss!

151
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.108
-I'm gonna just stop talking!
-Finally!

152
00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:13.529
But this is taking forever, Shrek.
There ain't no in-flight movie or nothing.

153
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.742
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.

154
00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:21.954
That's where we're going. Far, far...

155
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.664
...away!

156
00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:27.335
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.

157
00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.921
Well, find a way to entertain yourself.

158
00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:55.363
For five minutes,

159
00:10:55.446 --> 00:10:59.951
could you not be yourself
for five minutes!

160
00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.751
Are we there yet?

161
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.003
-Yes!
-Oh, finally!

162
00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:25.309
Wow!

163
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:30.481
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

164
00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.901
Hey, good looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!

165
00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:36.445
- Star maps! Get your star maps!
- Ooh, panty hose!

166
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:45.162
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

167
00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.249
Halt.

Hey, everyone look!

170
00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:13.816
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
Yeah. You working that hat.

171
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.785
Swimming pools! Movie stars!

172
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.990
Announcing the long-awaited return

173
00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:07.578
of the beautiful Princess Fiona
and her new husband.

174
00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.123
Well, this is it.

175
00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:13.167
-This is it.
-This is it.

176

This is it.

177
00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:40.152
Uh, why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

178
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.242
So...

179
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.120
...you still think this is a good idea?

180
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:53.624
Of course. Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.

181
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.626
Who on earth are they?

182
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.712
I think that's our little girl.

183
00:13:57.795 --> 00:14:01.298
That's not little.
That's a really big problem.

184
00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:04.552
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

185
00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:08.014
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look--

186
00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:11.851
Happy now? We came. We saw them.

187
00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:14.437
Now let's go
before they light the torches.

188
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.857
-They're my parents.
-Hello, they locked you in a tower.

189
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.191
Hey, that was for my own--

190
00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:22.903
Good! Now here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

191
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.447
Harold, we have to be--

192
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.366
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

193
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.535
Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be--

194
00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:31.954
A disaster! There is no way--

195
00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.664
-You can do this.
-But I really--

196
00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:34.582
-Really--
-Really--

Here!

199
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:42.006
Mom,

200
00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:43.466
Dad...

201
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.887
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

202
00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.433
Well, um--

203
00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:57.646
It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

204
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.635
Hmm.

205
00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.644
Excuse me.

206
00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:39.355
Better out than in, I always say,
eh, Fiona?

207
00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:43.609
That's good.

208
00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.612
-Uh...
-I guess not.

209
00:15:46.695 --> 00:15:48.280
What do you mean,
"not on the list"?

210
00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.241
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

211
00:15:50.324 --> 00:15:53.661
Hey, what's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

212
00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:55.246
I had the hardest time finding this place.

213
00:15:55.329 --> 00:15:57.665
No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

214
00:15:57.748 --> 00:16:01.127
No, no, no, Dad. Dad, it's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

215
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.713
-He helped rescue me from the dragon.
-Yep, that's me, the noble steed.

216
00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.715
Hey, waiter!
How about a bowl for the steed?

217
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:07.883
Oh, boy.

218
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.721
-Um, Shrek?
-Yeah?

219
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:16.267
Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs. Q.

220
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.893
- Mmm.
- No, no, no.

221
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.186
Darling.

222
00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:22.481
Oh!

223
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:27.862
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.

224
00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:32.616
Well, Shrek owns his own land.

225
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.119
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

226
00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:38.080
It's in an enchanted forest,

227
00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.583
abundant in squirrels

228
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.544
and cute little duckies and--

229
00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:45.963
What? I know you ain't
talking about the swamp.

230
00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:49.842
-Donkey!
-An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original.

231
00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:53.804
Well, I suppose that would be
a fine place to raise the children.

232
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.397
Ah...

233
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.109
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

234
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:10.112
-Indeed. I just started eating.
-Harold!

235
00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:12.865
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Dad. It's great, okay?

236
00:17:12.948 --> 00:17:15.743
-Well, for his type, yes.
-My type?

237
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:17.661
I got to go to the bathroom.

238
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:21.165
-Dinner is served!
-Never mind. I can hold it.

239
00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:30.674
<i>-Bon appétit!</i>
-Oh, Mexican food! My favorite.

240
00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:34.511
Well, let's not just sit here with
our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.

241
00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:35.804
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

242
00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:39.725
So, I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be--

243
00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:41.644
Ogres, yes!

244
00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:45.189
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

245
00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:47.149
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

246
00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.319
That is,
assuming you don't eat your own young!

247
00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:51.779
-Dad!
-Oh, no.

248
00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:55.324
We usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

249
00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:58.619
-Shrek, please!
-I only did that because I love her.

250
00:17:58.702 --> 00:18:01.580
Oh, aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

251
00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:03.749
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

252
00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:12.758
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

253
00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:18.514

- Shrek!

254
00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:19.598

-Fiona!

255
00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:20.933

Look...

299

Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother,

300
00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:19.862
but I really don't need all this.

301
00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:24.658
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

302
00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:28.287
Fiona? Fiona!

303
00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:35.085
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.

304
00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:36.462
Oh, uh--

305
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:39.631
Fairy Godmother, furniture,

306
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.509
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.

307
00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:46.388
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

308
00:21:46.472 --> 00:21:48.265
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

309
00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:49.850
But that can't be right.

310
00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:51.935
Oh, great, more relatives.

311
00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:53.812
She's just trying to help.

312
00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:57.107
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.

313
00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:58.901
-What?
-Leaving? I don't want to leave.

314
00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.360
When did you decide this?

315
00:22:00.444 --> 00:22:01.612
Shortly after arriving.

316
00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:03.447
Look, I-- I'm sorry.

317
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.533
No, no, no, no, that's all right.
Uh, I need to go, anyway.

318
00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:10.078
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me,

319
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.998
happiness is just a teardrop away.

320
00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:15.584
Thanks, but we've got all the happiness
we need.

321
00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:17.544
Happy, happy, happy!

322
00:22:17.628 --> 00:22:19.588
So I see.

323
00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:21.465
Let's go, Kyle.

324
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:25.969
Very nice, Shrek.

325
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:28.805
What? I told you
coming here was a bad idea.

326
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:31.558
You could have at least tried
to get along with my father.

327
00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:36.063
Somehow I don't think I was gonna get
Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it.

328
00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:39.608
Do you think it might be nice
if somebody asked me what I wanted?

329
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:42.653
Sure. Do you want me to pack for you?

330
00:22:43.237 --> 00:22:44.947
You're unbelievable!

331
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.324
You're behaving like a--

332
00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:49.201
Go on! Say it!

333
00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:50.702
Like an ogre!

334
00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:52.204
Here's a news flash for you!

335
00:22:52.287 --> 00:22:54.498
Whether your parents like it or not,

336
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:56.166
I am an ogre!

337
00:23:01.964 --> 00:23:05.801
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

338
00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:15.769
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

339
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:19.648
That's real smooth, Shrek.

340
00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:23.860
"I'm an ogre!"

341
00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:51.096
- I knew this would happen.
- You should. You started it.

342
00:23:51.179 --> 00:23:55.225
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
I mean, really. He's the ogre, not me.

343
00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:58.645
I think, Harold, you're taking this
a little too personally.

344
00:23:58.729 --> 00:24:00.564
This is Fiona's choice.

345
00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:04.443
Yes, but she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked out for her.

346
00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:08.530
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this-- this thing?

347
00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:12.200
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.

348
00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:15.871
I don't want to lose
our daughter again, Harold.

349
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:20.125
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

350
00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:23.086
Don't you remember when we were young

351
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.589
and, oh, we used to walk down
by the lily pond...

352
00:24:25.672 --> 00:24:27.341
...and they were in bloom...

353
00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:28.675
Our first kiss.

354
00:24:29.384 --> 00:24:30.886
It's not the same!

355
00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:34.765
I don't think you realize that
our daughter has married a monster!

356
00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:37.142
Oh, stop being such a drama king.

357
00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:39.144
Fine! Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!

358
00:24:39.227 --> 00:24:40.854
La-di-da-di-da-di-da!

359
00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:44.566
Isn't it all wonderful? I'd like to know
how it could get any worse!

360
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:45.692
Hello, Harold.

361
00:24:45.776 --> 00:24:47.611
-What happened?
-Oh, n-nothing!

362
00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:51.823
Nothing, dear. Just the old, uh,
crusade wound playing up a bit.

363
00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:54.743
I'll, um,
just stretch it out here for a while.

364
00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:57.871
You better get in. We need to talk.

365
00:24:57.954 --> 00:25:00.624
Actually, Fairy Godmother,
just off to bed.

366
00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:03.960
Already taken my pills,
and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

367
00:25:04.044 --> 00:25:07.673
So, um, how about--
We-- We make this a quick visit. What?

368
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:10.467
Oh. Oh, h-hello.

369
00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:14.971
So, what's new?

370
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:18.141
You remember my son, Prince Charming?

371
00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:22.270
Charming! Oh, is that you?
My gosh! It's been years.

372
00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.564
I-- When-- When did you get back?

373
00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:27.693
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

374
00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:31.321
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert,

375
00:25:31.405 --> 00:25:33.448
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower--

376
00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:36.118
Mommy can handle this.

377
00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:40.997
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

378
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:44.251
He climbs to the highest bloody room
of the tallest bloody tower!

379
00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:46.253
-But-- But--
-And what does he find?

380
00:25:46.336 --> 00:25:50.048
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess...

381
00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:52.008
-If I can just--
-...is already married.

382
00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:54.553
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.

383
00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:56.304
Stop the car!

384
00:25:58.432 --> 00:25:59.474
Harold...

385
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:05.230
...you force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

386
00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:07.274
Where are we?

387
00:26:07.357 --> 00:26:10.360
Hi there. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy.
May I take your order?

388
00:26:10.444 --> 00:26:14.030
My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy.

389
00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:17.451
Uh, okay, two Renaissance Wraps,
no mayo, chili rings--

390
00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:18.952
I'll have the Medieval Meal.

391
00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:21.788
Yeah, one Medieval Meal
and, Harold, curly fries?

392
00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:24.207
-Uh, no. No, thank you.
-Sourdough soft taco, then?

393
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:25.917
-What do you want?
-No, really, I'm fine.

394
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:27.586
Your order, Fairy Godmother.

395
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:29.755
And this comes with the Medieval Meal.

396
00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:31.465
Here you are, dear.

397
00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:36.052
You see, we made a deal, Harold,

398
00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:38.930
and I assume
you don't want me to go back on my part.

399
00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:40.640
Indeed not.

400
00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:44.311
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.

401
00:26:44.394 --> 00:26:45.353
Yes.

402
00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:48.356
Oh, believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

403
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.358
Not only for your daughter...

404
00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:53.779
...but for your Kingdom.

405
00:26:58.658 --> 00:27:00.827
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

406
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.997
Use your imagination.

407
00:27:38.949 --> 00:27:39.783
Oh.

408
00:27:42.536 --> 00:27:44.579

Uh, excuse me.
I-I-- I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.

Ah, there you are. Right.

-Who's the guy?
-Well, he-- he's not a guy, per se.

418
00:28:28.915 --> 00:28:31.293
Um, he's an ogre.

419
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.214
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

420
00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:39.259
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that,

421
00:28:39.342 --> 00:28:42.470
and, frankly,
he don't like to be disturbed.

422
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.180

00:28:50.645 --> 00:28:52.731

425
00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:56.401
Sorry! I-- I hope I'm not interrupting,
but I'm told you're the one to talk to

426
00:28:56.484 --> 00:28:58.486
about an ogre problem?

427
00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.572
You are told correct.

428
00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:04.200
But for this,
I charge a great deal of money.

429
00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:07.078
Would this be enough?

430
00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:18.673
Hmm. You have engaged
my valuable services, Your Majesty.

431
00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:22.010

<i>... Charming.</i>

458
00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:46.571
S-Sorry. Uh, I--
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

459
00:31:46.654 --> 00:31:52.202
No, no, no.
I was just reading a, uh-- a scary book.

460
00:31:52.827 --> 00:31:57.373
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behavior earlier.

461
00:31:57.457 --> 00:32:00.210
-Okay?
-I don't know what came over me.

462
00:32:00.293 --> 00:32:03.463
Do you suppose we could just pretend
it never happened and start over?

463
00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:04.923
Look, Your Majesty, I--

464
00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:06.424
Please, call me Dad.

465
00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:11.137
Dad, we both acted like ogres.

466
00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:14.390
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other?

467
00:32:14.474 --> 00:32:15.517
Excellent idea.

468
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.978
I was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

469
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:20.980
Little father-son time?

470
00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:25.276
I know it would mean the world to Fiona.

471
00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:37.747
Shall we say, 7:30 by the old oak?

472
00:32:43.878 --> 00:32:45.755
Face it, Donkey. We're lost.

473
00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:49.008
We can't be lost. We followed
the King's instructions exactly.

474
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:51.427
What did he say? "Head to the deepest,
darkest part of the woods."

475
00:32:51.511 --> 00:32:53.096
-Aye.
-"Past the sinister trees

476
00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:55.056
-with those scary-looking branches."
-Check.

477
00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.016
Yeah and there's that bush shaped
like Shirley Bassey.

478
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.602
We passed that bush three times already!

479
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:02.230
You were the one who said you didn't
want to stop and get directions.

480
00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:06.943
Oh, great. My one chance
to fix things up with Fiona's dad

481
00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:09.154
and I end up lost in the woods with you!

482
00:33:09.237 --> 00:33:11.489
You don't have to get all huffy with me,
I'm only trying to help.

483
00:33:11.573 --> 00:33:13.658
I know! I know.

484
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.203
I'm sorry, all right?

485
00:33:17.287 --> 00:33:19.247
Hey, don't worry about it.

486
00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.584
I just really need to make things work
with this guy.

487
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:25.044
Yeah, sure. Now, let's go bond with Daddy.

488
00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:34.804
Well, well, well, Donkey.

489
00:33:34.888 --> 00:33:38.516
I know it was kind of a tender moment
back there, but the purring?

490
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.435
Man, what are you talking about?
I ain't purring.

491
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.937
Sure. What's next? A hug?

492
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:44.814
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.

493
00:33:44.898 --> 00:33:46.357
What you think I am, some kind of--

494
00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:49.527
Ha-ha! Fear me. If you dare.

495
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:51.738
Hey, look. A little cat.

496
00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:55.283
-Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
-It's a cat, Donkey.

497
00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:57.285
Come here, little kitty kitty kitty.

498
00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.204
Come on, little kitty.

499
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:02.790
Come here. Come here, little kitty.

500
00:34:05.501 --> 00:34:07.712
-Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
-Oh, come on! Oh!

501
00:34:07.795 --> 00:34:10.340
Get it off! Oh, get it off!

502
00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:14.510
No! Oh!

503
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:18.223
-Hold on, Shrek! Hold still!
-Get it off!

504
00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:19.432
Shrek, hold still!

505
00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:22.727
Did I miss?

506
00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.730
No, you got them.

507
00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:32.654
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...

508
00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:36.449
Puss in Boots.

509
00:34:36.532 --> 00:34:38.910
I'll kill that cat!

510
00:34:58.429 --> 00:35:00.181
Hair ball.

511
00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:01.849
Oh, that is nasty.

512
00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:04.894
What do you reckon we should do with him?

513
00:35:04.978 --> 00:35:06.938
I say we take the sword
and neuter him right here.

514
00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:08.273
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

515
00:35:08.356 --> 00:35:09.816
Oh, mother, no. <i>Por favor.</i>

516
00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:13.111
Please, I implore you.
It was nothing personal <i>señor.</i>

517
00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:15.863
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she's sick.

518
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.366
And my father lives off the garbage.

519
00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:21.452
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers--

520
00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:23.496
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

521
00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:26.332
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

522
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.750
The rich King? <i>Si</i>

523
00:35:31.587 --> 00:35:34.757
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.

524
00:35:34.841 --> 00:35:36.592
Oh, come on, Shrek. Don't feel bad.

525
00:35:36.676 --> 00:35:38.678
Almost everybody that meets you
wants to kill you.

526
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:39.887
Gee, thanks.

527
00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:47.228
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

528
00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:49.147
<i>Si!That</i>'s what the King said.

529
00:35:50.732 --> 00:35:53.901
Oh, uh-- Sorry. I thought that question
was directed at me.

530
00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:57.989
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'll do anything for her.

531
00:35:58.072 --> 00:36:00.783
Well, it's not like I wouldn't change
if I could.

532
00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:05.371
I just--
I just wish I could make her happy.

533
00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:08.916
Hold the phone.

534
00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:12.128
Happiness.

535
00:36:13.129 --> 00:36:15.340
A tear drop away.

536
00:36:16.132 --> 00:36:19.677
Donkey, think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you.

537
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:22.305
Oh, man, where do I begin?

538
00:36:22.388 --> 00:36:25.391
First, it was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

539
00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:26.768
I ain't never got over that.

540
00:36:26.851 --> 00:36:28.394
Then this fool went off and had a party

541
00:36:28.478 --> 00:36:30.646
and he have all the guests trying
to pin a tail on me.

542
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.232
Then they all got drunk and started
beating me with a stick going,

543
00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:34.776
"Piñata! Piñata!"

544
00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.152
What is a piñata, anyway?

545
00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:38.696
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

546
00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.406
Yeah, well, don't go projecting on me.

547
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.533
I know you're feeling bad
but you gotta let your own--

548
00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:47.872
You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of...

549
00:36:55.338 --> 00:36:58.466
<i>What? Is it on? Is it</i> on?

550
00:36:58.549 --> 00:37:00.301
<i>This is Fairy Godmother.</i>

551
00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:02.720
<i>I'm either away from my desk
or with a client.</i>

552
00:37:02.804 --> 00:37:07.308
<i>But if you come by the office, we'll be
glad to make you a personal appointment.</i>

553
00:37:07.392 --> 00:37:08.976
<i>Have a "happy ever after."</i>

554
00:37:11.604 --> 00:37:12.605
Oh.

555
00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:15.650
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

556
00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:16.943
All right! That's more like it!

557
00:37:17.026 --> 00:37:19.362
Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

558
00:37:19.445 --> 00:37:21.781
♪ <i>Ain't no stoppin' us now</i> ♪

559
00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:24.242
- ♪ <i>Whoo! We're on the move!</i> ♪
- Stop, Ogre!

560
00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:27.537
-I have misjudged you.
-Join the club. We've got jackets.

561
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.624
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany
you until I have saved your life

562
00:37:31.707 --> 00:37:32.959
as you have spared me mine.

563
00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:36.879
I'm sorry, the position of annoying
talking animal has already been taken.

564
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.256
Let's go, Shrek.

565
00:37:38.881 --> 00:37:39.715
Shrek?

566
00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:52.103
-Shrek!
-Oh, come on, Donkey. Look at him

567
00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:54.147
in his wee little boots.

568
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:56.482
You know, how many cats can wear boots?

569
00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:57.567
Honestly?

570
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:59.527
-Aw, let's keep him.
-Say what?

571
00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:05.074
Aw, listen, he's purring.

572
00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:08.244
-Oh, so now it's cute?
-Aw, come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

573
00:38:08.327 --> 00:38:11.873
Lighten up? Oh, I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

574
00:38:15.543 --> 00:38:16.544
Shrek.

575
00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:22.800
Shrek?

576
00:38:33.227 --> 00:38:36.022
Well, they're both festive, aren't they?

577
00:38:36.105 --> 00:38:37.773
What do you think, Harold?

578
00:38:37.857 --> 00:38:40.568
Um, yes, yes. Fine. Fine.

579
00:38:42.236 --> 00:38:46.240
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

580
00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:48.618
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it really matters.

581
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:50.912
How do we know
there's even going to be a ball?

582
00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.830
Mom! Dad!

583
00:38:52.914 --> 00:38:56.626
-Oh, hello, dear.
-Um, what's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

584
00:38:56.709 --> 00:38:59.378
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

585
00:38:59.462 --> 00:39:02.256
I haven't. You should ask your father.

586
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.802
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

587
00:39:06.886 --> 00:39:09.764
-Can I help you, Your Majesty?
-Ah, yes! Um--

588
00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:13.267
Hmm. Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

589
00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:16.437
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

590
00:39:16.521 --> 00:39:19.023
Ah, yes. Very good, then.

591
00:39:19.106 --> 00:39:21.275
- Carry on, Cedric.
- Dad?

592
00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:23.653
-Dad? Have you seen Shrek?
-Uh, no, I haven't, dear.

593
00:39:23.736 --> 00:39:28.366
I-- I'm sure he just went off to look
for a nice mud hole to cool down in.

594
00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:30.535
You know,
after your little spat last night.

595
00:39:30.618 --> 00:39:32.787
Oh. You heard that, huh?

596
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.330
Darling, the whole kingdom heard you.

597
00:39:34.413 --> 00:39:39.418
I mean, after all it is in his nature
to be, well, a bit of a brute.

598
00:39:39.502 --> 00:39:43.297
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

599
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:46.759
Well, what did you expect?
I mean, look at what he's done to you.

600
00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:49.845
Shrek loves me for who I am.

601
00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:53.266
I would think you'd be happy for me.

602
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:56.894
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

603
00:39:56.978 --> 00:39:59.564
Maybe you should do the same.

604
00:40:13.619 --> 00:40:15.830
-No, really?
-Mm-hmm.

605
00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:19.250
Shh, shh, shh...

606
00:40:21.544 --> 00:40:22.712
Whoa.

607
00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:30.636
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's just back away slowly.

608
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.471
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

609
00:40:32.555 --> 00:40:36.058
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

610
00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:38.853
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell?

611
00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.564
Spell.

612
00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.694
He makes me laugh.

613
00:40:48.738 --> 00:40:50.948
Oh.

614
00:40:52.491 --> 00:40:54.452
Hi. I'm here to see the--

615
00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:57.663
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.

616
00:40:57.747 --> 00:41:00.666
<i>Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!</i>

617
00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:05.171
Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away.

618
00:41:05.254 --> 00:41:08.007
Look, she's not seeing
any client today, okay?

619
00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.259
That's okay, buddy. We're from the union.

620
00:41:10.343 --> 00:41:11.344
The union?

621
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:15.806
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

622
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.642
Oh! Oh, right.

623
00:41:17.725 --> 00:41:20.770
Are you feeling
at all degraded or oppressed?

624
00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:22.772
Uh, a little.

625
00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:24.523
We-- We don't even have dental.

626
00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:26.108
They don't even have dental.

627
00:41:26.776 --> 00:41:28.861
Okay. We're just gonna have a look around.

628
00:41:28.944 --> 00:41:30.071
Oh, by the way,

629
00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:33.449
I think it'd be better if the
Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here.

630
00:41:33.532 --> 00:41:36.786
-Know what I'm saying? Huh? Huh?
-Huh? Huh? Huh?

631
00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:39.789
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

632
00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:11.487
A drop of desire.

633
00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:13.739
Naughty.

634
00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:17.076
A pinch of passion.

635
00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:26.252
And just a hint of lust.

636
00:42:30.005 --> 00:42:31.632
Excuse me.

637
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:33.426
Sorry to barge in like this but--

638
00:42:33.509 --> 00:42:36.137
What in Grimm's name are you doing here?

639
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.722
Well...

640
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:41.684
...it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy.

641
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.688
And there's some question
as to why that is?

642
00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:48.733
Well, let's explore that, shall we?

643
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:54.405
Ah. P. P. P. P. Princess. Cinderella.

644
00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:56.574
Here we are. "Lived happily ever after."

645
00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:57.950
Oh!

646
00:42:58.033 --> 00:42:59.452
No ogres.

647
00:42:59.535 --> 00:43:01.579
Let's see. Snow White.

648
00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:05.291
A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres.

649
00:43:05.374 --> 00:43:07.626
Sleeping Beauty. Ooh, no ogres.

650
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.838
Hansel and Gretel? No. Thumbelina? No.

651
00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:13.883
The Golden Bird,
the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman.

652
00:43:13.966 --> 00:43:16.886
No, no, no, no, no!

653
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:21.098
You see,
ogres don't live happily ever after.

654
00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:22.308
All right, look, lady!

655
00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:26.520
Don't you point
those dirty green sausages at me!

656
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.358
Your Monte Cristo and coffee. Oh, sorry.

657
00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:35.154
Ah! That's okay. We were just leaving.

658
00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:38.616
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.

659
00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:40.493
Just go.

660
00:43:40.576 --> 00:43:41.827
Come on, guys.

661
00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.512
TGIF, eh, buddy?

662
00:44:01.847 --> 00:44:04.433
Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?

663
00:44:12.566 --> 00:44:13.818
Oh!

664
00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:16.654
Hey, man. You wanna get your fine
Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks

665
00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:18.531
out of my face? Man, that stinks!

666
00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:22.409
Well, you don't exactly smell
like a basket of roses.

667
00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:30.000
-Well, one of these has got to help.
-I was just concocting this very plan.

668
00:44:30.084 --> 00:44:32.670
Already our minds are becoming one.

669
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:34.463
Whoa, whoa, whoa, there.

670
00:44:34.547 --> 00:44:37.675
Listen, if we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.

671
00:44:37.758 --> 00:44:39.844
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

672
00:44:39.927 --> 00:44:43.389
Look. Make yourself useful
and go keep watch.

673
00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:46.058
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

674
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:47.643
<i>No problem a,</i> boss.

675
00:44:47.726 --> 00:44:52.022
In one of my nine lives I was the great
cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela.

676
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:54.775
Shrek, are you off your nut?

677
00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:56.443
Donkey, keep watch.

678
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.362
Keep watch? Yeah. I'm gonna keep watch.

679
00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:01.240
I'll watch that wicked witch come
down here and whammy zammy a world of hurt

680
00:45:01.323 --> 00:45:02.366
all up your backside.

681
00:45:02.449 --> 00:45:05.327
I'm gonna laugh too. If she do,
I'm gonna be giggling to myself.

682
00:45:05.411 --> 00:45:08.205
-What do you see?
-Toadstool softener?

683
00:45:08.289 --> 00:45:10.958
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution

684
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.334
for marital problems.

685
00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:14.336
-"Elfa Seltzer"?
-Uh-uh.

686
00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.254
"Hex Lax"?

687
00:45:15.337 --> 00:45:17.840
No! Try "handsome".

688
00:45:19.174 --> 00:45:20.593
Sorry. No handsome.

689
00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:24.638
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?

690
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:26.807
Well, what does it do?

691
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.269
It says "Beauty Divine."

692
00:45:30.352 --> 00:45:33.689

are revered as the wisest of creatures.

693

694

695
00:45:39.445 --> 00:45:41.030
That'll have to do. We've got company.

696
00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:49.830

697

What? Where is he, Mom?

722
00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:40.190
I shall rend his head from his shoulders.

723
00:47:40.274 --> 00:47:42.568
I will smite him where he stands.

00:47:54.079 --> 00:47:55.706
<i>Pardon?</i> Um--

728
00:47:55.789 --> 00:48:00.169

Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

730
00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:03.630
Oh.

731
00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:07.176
I do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

"Happily Ever After Potion.

you both will be fine.

735
00:48:18.604 --> 00:48:21.190

736
00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:24.943
-You both will be fine?
-I guess it means it'll affect Fiona too.

737
00:48:25.986 --> 00:48:29.656
Hey, man. This don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.

738
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.701
So why don't you just drop that
jug o' voodoo and let's get out of here?

739
00:48:32.785 --> 00:48:35.996
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?

740
00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:41.418
Aha, see, you're allergic to that stuff.
You're gonna have a reaction.

741
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:44.588
And if you think that I'm gonna be
smearing Vapor Rub all over your chest,

742
00:48:44.671 --> 00:48:45.756
think again!

743
00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:49.009
Boss, just in case there is something
wrong with the potion,

744
00:48:49.093 --> 00:48:51.011
allow me to take the first sip.

745
00:48:51.095 --> 00:48:53.931
It would be an honor to lay my life
on the line for you.

746
00:48:54.014 --> 00:48:55.641
Oh, no, no, no, no.

747
00:48:55.724 --> 00:48:59.353
I don't think so. If there's gonna be
any animal testing, I'm gonna do it.

748
00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:02.439
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

749
00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:09.530
How do you feel?

750
00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:13.826
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?

751
00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:15.494
You still look like an ass to me.

752
00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.789
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.

753
00:49:20.415 --> 00:49:23.544
Well, here's to us, Fiona.

754
00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:26.880
Shrek, you drink that,
there's no going back.

755
00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:27.840
I know.

756
00:49:27.923 --> 00:49:30.092
-But no more wallowing in the mud?
-I know.

757
00:49:30.175 --> 00:49:31.718
-And no more itchy butt crack?
-I know!

758
00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.804
-But you love being an ogre!
-I know!

759
00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.184
But I love Fiona more.

760
00:49:41.186 --> 00:49:42.896
Shrek, no! Wait!

761
00:49:55.701 --> 00:49:57.244
Whoo, cold. Got to be.

762
00:49:57.327 --> 00:50:00.289
Shrek I think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.

763
00:50:00.372 --> 00:50:01.373
Maybe it's a dud.

764
00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.918
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

765
00:50:09.256 --> 00:50:12.384
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I think I feel something coming on.

766
00:50:12.467 --> 00:50:15.053
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

767
00:50:15.137 --> 00:50:16.346
I don't want to die!

768
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.183
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!

769
00:50:19.266 --> 00:50:21.351
I'm melting!

770
00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:23.353
It's just the rain, Donkey.

771
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.648
Oh.

772
00:51:08.315 --> 00:51:11.652
Oh, Shrek, don't worry. Things just
seem bad because it's dark and rainy,

773
00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:14.112
and Fiona's father hired a sleazy hit man
to whack you.

774
00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:17.574
It'll be better in the morning.

00:55:11.725 --> 00:55:14.853
look out, Princess. Here comes the new me.

842
00:55:16.354 --> 00:55:18.982
Uh, first things first.
We need to get you out of those clothes.

843
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:25.280
-Ready?
-Ready.

844
00:55:29.576 --> 00:55:31.453
Driver, stop!

845
00:55:31.536 --> 00:55:34.664
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

846
00:55:34.748 --> 00:55:38.251
I'm blind! Tell the truth. Will I ever
be able to play the violin again?

847
00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:42.339
Oh, you poor creature.
Is there anything I can do for you?

848
00:55:43.089 --> 00:55:44.883
Well, I guess there is one thing.

849
00:55:44.966 --> 00:55:47.677
Take off the powdered wig
and step away from your drawers.

850
00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:54.017
-Not bad.
-Not bad at all.

851
00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:05.111
Father? Is everything all right, Father?

852
00:56:10.617 --> 00:56:14.538
Thank you, gentlemen.
Someday, I will repay you.

853
00:56:14.621 --> 00:56:17.624
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.

Shrek!

870
00:57:40.832 --> 00:57:41.666
Fiona.

871
00:57:45.253 --> 00:57:46.963
Hello, handsome.

872
00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:49.633
Shrek!

873
00:57:50.383 --> 00:57:52.177
Princess!

874
00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:55.013
-Donkey?
-Wow! That potion worked on you, too, huh?

875
00:57:55.096 --> 00:57:57.974
- W-What potion?
- It's kind of a long story,

876
00:57:58.058 --> 00:58:02.646
but Shrek and I took some magic potion,
and, well, now, we're sexy!

877
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:06.399
Shrek?

878
00:58:09.277 --> 00:58:11.946
For you, baby, I could be.

879
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.407
-Yeah, you wish.
-Donkey, where is Shrek?

880
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:16.159
He just went inside looking for you.

881
00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:19.829
Shrek!

882
00:58:20.538 --> 00:58:21.790
Fiona!

883
00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:23.416
Fiona!

884
00:58:25.085 --> 00:58:26.920
You wanna dance, pretty boy?

885
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:33.718
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?

886
00:58:35.136 --> 00:58:36.346
Fiona.

887
00:58:38.598 --> 00:58:39.766
Shrek?

888
00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:42.686
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

889
00:58:42.769 --> 00:58:44.437
What happened to your voice?

890
00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:47.941
Uh, the potion changed
a lot of things, Fiona,

891
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:50.944
but not the way I feel about you.

892
00:58:51.444 --> 00:58:52.445
Fiona?

893
00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:57.283
- Charming?
- Uh, do you think so?

894
00:58:57.367 --> 00:59:00.537
Dad, I was so hoping you'd approve.

895
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.414
Um, who are you?

896
00:59:02.497 --> 00:59:04.374
Mom, it's me, Shrek.

897
00:59:04.457 --> 00:59:08.044
I know you never get a second chance
at a first impression

898
00:59:08.128 --> 00:59:10.296
but, well, what do you think?

899
00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:17.178
Fiona! Fiona!

900
00:59:17.846 --> 00:59:18.888
Fiona!

901
00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:20.640
Fiona!

902
00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.560
- Fiona!
- "Fiona! Fiona!"

903
00:59:23.643 --> 00:59:25.937
Oh, shoot!

904
00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.356
I don't think they can hear us, pigeon.

905
00:59:31.192 --> 00:59:34.571
Don't you think
you've already messed her life up enough?

906
00:59:35.155 --> 00:59:37.323
I just wanted her to be happy.

907
00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:39.159
And now she can be.

908
00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:42.120
Oh, sweetheart.

909
00:59:42.203 --> 00:59:45.665
She's finally found
the prince of her dreams.

910
00:59:45.749 --> 00:59:46.958
But look at me.

911
00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:49.794
Look what I've done for her.

912
00:59:49.878 --> 00:59:53.256
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

913
00:59:53.339 --> 00:59:57.385
She's a princess, and you're an ogre.

914
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:01.431
That's something no amount of potion
is ever going to change.

915
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.231
But...

916
01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.400
I love her.

917
01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:14.235
If you really love her,

918
01:00:15.528 --> 01:00:17.280
you'll let her go.

919
01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:24.662
- Shrek?
<i>- Señor.</i>

920
01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.499
Hey, what's going on? Where you going?

921
01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:37.884
You wouldn't have had anything
to do with this, would you, Harold?

Just leave the bottle, Doris.

926
01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.822
Hey, why the long face?

927
01:01:00.114 --> 01:01:02.450
It was all just a stupid mistake.

928
01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:07.205
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

929
01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:11.376
I hate Mondays.

930
01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:15.213
I can't believe you're gonna walk away
from the best thing that happened to you.

931
01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:16.923
What choice do I have?

932
01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:20.426
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.

933
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.720
Oh, come on now.
Is he really that good-looking?

934
01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:25.098
Are you kidding? He's gorgeous.

935
01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:28.268
He has a face that looks
like it was carved by angels.

936
01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.436
Mmm. He sounds dreamy.

937
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.357
You know, shockingly,
this isn't making me feel any better.

938
01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:40.405
Look, guys, it's for the best.

939
01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:45.076
Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona
gets the man she's always dreamed of.

940
01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.412
Everybody wins.

941
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.290
Except for you.

942
01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.668
I don't get it, Shrek. You love Fiona.

943
01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:55.169
Aye.

944
01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:58.381
And that's why I have to let her go.

945
01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:00.466
Um-- Excuse me...

946
01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:02.677
is-- is she here?

947
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.762
She's, uh, in the back.

948
01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:08.016
Oh, hello again.

949
01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:14.230
Uh, Fairy Godmother. Charming.

950
01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:18.359
You better have a good reason
for dragging us down here, Harold.

951
01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:24.032
Well, uh-- I'm afraid Fiona isn't really
warming up to Prince Charming.

952
01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.492
Um, FYI, not my fault.

953
01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.244
No, no, of course it's not, dear.

954
01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:32.540
I mean, how charming can I be when
I have to pretend I'm that dreadful ogre?

955
01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:34.292
No! No, it's nobody's fault.

956
01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:38.046
Um, perhaps it's best
if we just call the whole thing off. Okay?

957
01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:39.047
What?

958
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.008
You can't force someone to fall in love.

959
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.843
I beg to differ.

960
01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.762
I do it all the time.

961
01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:48.932
Have Fiona drink this,
and she'll fall in love

962
01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:52.268
with the first man she kisses,
which will be Charming.

963
01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:56.439
-Uh-- No.
-What did you say?

964
01:02:56.522 --> 01:02:59.067
I-- I can't. I-- I won't do it.

965
01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:00.652
Oh, yes, you will.

966
01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:04.238
If you remember,
I helped you with your happily ever after,

967
01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:07.867
and I can take it away just as easily.

968
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.036
Is that what you want?

969
01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.120
Is it?

970
01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:14.666
- N-- No.
- Good boy.

971
01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:18.628
Now, we have to go. I need to do
Charming's hair before the ball.

972
01:03:18.711 --> 01:03:21.297
He's hopeless.
You know, he's all high in the front.

973
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:24.217
He can never get to the back.
You always need someone to do the back.

974
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.844
- Oh, thank you, Mother.
- Mother?

975
01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:30.890
Uh, Mary! A talking horse!

976
01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:32.016
The ogre!

977
01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.061
Stop them!

978
01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.813
Thieves! Bandits!

979
01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.439
Stop them!

980
01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:42.652
Well, the abs are fab
and it's gluteus to the Maximus

981
01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:46.280
here at tonight's
Far, Far Away Royal Ball Blowout!

982
01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:49.158
The coaches are lined up
as the cream of the crop pours out of them

983
01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.119
like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.

984
01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:55.373
Everyone who's anyone has turned out to
honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

985
01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:58.793
And, oh, my, the outfits look gorgeous!

986
01:03:58.876 --> 01:04:00.086
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

987
01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.922
What the heck are the crumbs for?

988
01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.967
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!

989
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:07.468
Oh, aren't they adorable?

990
01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:08.720
Whoa!

991
01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:12.015
Here comes Sleeping Beauty! Oh!

992
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.850
Tired old thing.

993
01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:17.478
Who's this? Who's this? Who is this?

994
01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:20.898
Oh! It's the one, it's the only,

995
01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:23.568
it's the Fairy Godmother!

996
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:28.031
Hello, Far, Far Away!

997
01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.866
Can I get a, "Whoop, whoop"?

998
01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:31.409
Whoop, whoop!

999
01:04:31.492 --> 01:04:34.954
May all your endings be happy and--

1000
01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.998
Well, you know the rest!

1001
01:04:38.082 --> 01:04:41.252

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:44.797

1004
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.967
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to <i>Wheel of Torture.</i>

1005
01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:51.637
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.

01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:54.474
Ah, whizzes on you guys.

1007

<i>We got a white bronco heading
east into the forest. Requesting backup.</i>

1011

1013
01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:15.912
<i>All right, all right! Let me go!</i>

1014
01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.706
<i>Why you grabbing me? Ow!
Police brutality! Police brutality!</i>

1015
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.041
<i>Come</i> on!

1016
01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.919
<i>- I have to talk to Princess Fiona!</i>
<i>- We warned you.</i>

1017
01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:24.128
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

1018
01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:27.048
<i>Will they getaway with it
or did someone let the cat out of the bag?</i>

1019
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:29.967
<i>You, capitalist pig</i> dogs!

1020
01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:32.970
<i>Get it off!</i>

1021
01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.848
- <i>Catnip.
- That's, uh, not mine.</i>

1022
01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.308
<i>Hold on, all right?</i>

1023
01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:39.811
<i>- Find Princess Fiona!</i>
<i>- Come on, guy.</i>

1024
01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:40.895
<i>I'm a donkey!</i>

1025
01:05:40.978 --> 01:05:43.147
<i>Tell her Shrek-- I'm her husband, Shrek!</i>

1026
01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:44.690
<i>- Ow, ow!</i>
- Knights.

1027
01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.192
Quick! Rewind it!

1028
01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:49.821
<i>Shrek-- I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow, ow!</i>

1029
01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:18.599
Darling?

1030
01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:21.894
Ah, I thought I might find you here.

1031
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:25.022
How about a nice, hot cup of tea
before the ball?

1032
01:06:26.607 --> 01:06:27.650
I'm not going.

1033
01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:31.279
B-B-But the-- the whole Kingdom's
turned out to celebrate your marriage.

1034
01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:33.197
There's just one problem.

1035
01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:34.949
That's not my husband.

1036
01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:37.660
I mean, look at him.

1037
01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:44.876
Yes, he is a bit different, but, uh,
people change for the ones they love.

1038
01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:48.087
You'd be surprised how much I changed
for your mother.

1039
01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.297
Change?

1040
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.216
He's completely lost his mind.

1041
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.428
Darling, why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

1042
01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.806
I mean, you might find
you like this new Shrek.

1043
01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:01.559
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.

1044
01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:05.229
I'd give anything
to have him back.

1045
01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:11.652
Uh, darling, that's mine. Decaf.

1046
01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:13.529
Otherwise I'm up all night.

1047
01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:21.412
Mmm. Thanks.

1048
01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:29.003
I got to get out of here!
You can't lock us up like this! Let me go!

1049
01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:30.379
What about my Miranda rights?

1050
01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:33.257
You're supposed to say
I have the right to remain silent.

1051
01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:34.967
Nobody said
I have the right to remain silent!

1052
01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:38.471
Donkey,
you have the right to remain silent.

1053
01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:40.848
What you lack is the capacity.

1054
01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:44.352
I must hold on before I, too,
go totally mad.

1055
01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:46.771
Shrek? Donkey?

1056
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.315
Too late.

1057
01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:52.401
Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here.

1058
01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:53.945
Oh!

1059
01:07:57.365 --> 01:08:00.034
<i>Fire in the hole!

1060
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.346
Look out below!

1061
01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.642
Quick, tell a lie.

1062
01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:27.478
-Well, uh, what should I say?
-Anything, but quick!

1063
01:08:27.561 --> 01:08:29.689
Say something crazy like,
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear."

1064
01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.775
I'm-- I am wearing ladies' underwear.

1065
01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.655
Are you?

1066
01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.699
I most certainly am not!

1067
01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.451
It looks like you most certainly am are.

1068
01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.120
-I am not!
-What kind?

1069
01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.705
-It's a thong!
-Ow!

1070
01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.039
They're briefs.

1071
01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:48.499
-Are not.
-Are too.

1072
01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:50.042
-Are not!
-Are too!

1073
01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.253
Here we go. Hang tight.

1074
01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:58.509
Hey, wait, wait, wait! Ow, ow!
Hey, hey, hey!

1075
01:08:58.592 --> 01:08:59.760
Ow!

1076
01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.682
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

1077
01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:06.892
-Mm-hmm?
-Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?

1078
01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:08.019
Sorry, boss.

1079
01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:10.813
Quit messing around.
We've got to stop that kiss!

1080
01:09:10.896 --> 01:09:12.732
I thought you was going to let her go.

1081
01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:15.109
I was,
but I can't let them do this to Fiona.

1082
01:09:15.192 --> 01:09:18.404
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's finally coming around.

1083
01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.239
But that's impossible. We'll never get in.

1084
01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.783
The castle is guarded
and there is a moat and everything!

1085
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.248
Well, folks, it looks like we're up
chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.

1086
01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.171
What?

1087
01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:36.839
Do you still know the Muffin Man?

1088
01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:40.926
Well, sure. He's down on Drury Lane. Why?

1089
01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.012
Because we're gonna need flour.

1090
01:09:43.804 --> 01:09:45.973
Lots and lots of flour.

1091
01:09:50.061 --> 01:09:51.354
Gingy!

1092
01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:55.816
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man.
We've got a big order to fill.

1093
01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:02.239
It's alive!

1094
01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:06.827
Whoa.

1095
01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:13.876
Run, run, run as fast you can!

1096
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.135
Go, baby, go!

1097
01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.640
There it is, Mongo. To the castle.

1098
01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:31.394
No, no, no, you great stupid pastry!

1099
01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:32.436
Come on!

1100
01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:42.530
-Mongo, down here. Look at the pony.
-Ooh.

1101
01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:44.115
Oh!

1102
01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:46.617
That's right, follow the pretty pony.

1103
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.412
Pretty pony wants to play at the castle.

1104
01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:50.663
Pretty pony.

1105
01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:56.669
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting Princess Fiona

1106
01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:59.964
and her new husband, Prince Shrek.

1107
01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.926
Shrek, what are you doing?

1108
01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:06.512
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.

1109
01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:09.223
Is that glitter on your lips?

1110
01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:12.226
Mmm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste?

1111
01:11:12.309 --> 01:11:14.520
Ugh! What is with you?

1112
01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:16.021
But, Muffin Cake...

1113
01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.110
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

Ladies and gentlemen.

1115
01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:29.368
I'd like to dedicate this song to

1117
01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.666

1186
01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.279
Hi-yah!

1187
01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:02.910
-Fiona.
-Shrek.

1188
01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:06.747
Harold, you were supposed
to give her the potion!

1189
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:10.834
Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea.

1190
01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:12.836
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

1191
01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:21.011
I told you,
ogres don't live happily ever after.

1192
01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:23.597
Harold!

1193
01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.266
- Shrek!
- No!

1194
01:17:31.104 --> 01:17:32.105
Ooh!

1195
01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:33.607
Ha!

1196
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.242
Oh...

1197
01:17:45.118 --> 01:17:46.161
Dad.

1198
01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:47.955
Daddy...

1199
01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.209
-Is he...
-Yup.

1200
01:17:54.211 --> 01:17:55.337
He croaked.

1201
01:17:57.589 --> 01:17:58.799
Harold?

1202
01:17:58.882 --> 01:18:00.968
Dad?

1203
01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:04.972
-I'd hoped you'd never see me like this.
-Man, and he gave you a hard time!

1204
01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:08.517
- Donkey!
- No, no, he's right. I'm sorry...

1205
01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.185
...to both of you.

1206
01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.938
I only wanted what was best for Fiona.

1207
01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:15.482
But I can see now

1208
01:18:16.441 --> 01:18:17.776
she already has it.

1209
01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.445
Shrek, Fiona,

1210
01:18:21.613 --> 01:18:25.242
will you accept an old frog's apologies

1211
01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:27.494
and my blessing?

1212
01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.415
-Harold...
-I'm sorry, Lillian.

1213
01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:34.835
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.

1214
01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:40.090
You're more that man today
than you ever were,

1215
01:18:40.173 --> 01:18:41.300
warts and all.

1216
01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.639
Boss, the Happily Ever After Potion!

1217
01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:48.807
Midnight!

1218
01:18:49.933 --> 01:18:52.686
Fiona, is this what you want?

1219
01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:56.857
-To be this way forever?
-What?

1220
01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:58.442
'Cause if you kiss me now,

1221
01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.111
we can stay like this.

1222
01:19:01.194 --> 01:19:03.614
You'd do that?

1223
01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.491
-For me?
-Yes.

1224
01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:17.544
I want what any princess wants,

1225
01:19:18.378 --> 01:19:20.589
to live happily ever after...

1226
01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.596
...with the ogre I married.

1227
01:19:30.515 --> 01:19:33.727
Whatever happens, I must not cry.

1228
01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:35.646
You cannot make me cry.

1229
01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.380
No. No.

1230
01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.756
No, no. No!

1231
01:20:02.839 --> 01:20:04.091
Ow!

1232
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.134
No. No!

1233
01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:09.096
Oh, no.

1234
01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:21.316
Ugh.

1235
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:29.908
Hey, you still look
like a noble steed to me.

1236
01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:37.165
Now, where were we?

1237
01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:39.251
Ooh! I remember.

1238
01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:47.426

1239
01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:50.345
