1
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.275
You answer
your mother's letter yet?

2
00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:56.140
I haven't even opened it.

3
00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.073
It came a week ago.

4
00:02:58.074 --> 00:02:59.971
The last one
came a year ago.

5
00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:01.629
Seth, I want you
to open the letter.

6
00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:04.079
And I want you
to write her back.

7
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.221
Why? You worried

8
00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:09.567
she'll think
you kept it from me?

9
00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:10.190
Because it's the right thing
to do, that's why.

10
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.399
I'm not writing her back.

11
00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:21.166
You're not going
anywhere tonight until you do.

12
00:03:49.574 --> 00:03:51.920
I brought you
a couple more boxes.

13
00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:53.060
I never fixed his closet door.

14
00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.516
If someone comes
to see the house,

15
00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:03.621
the closet
should have a door.

16
00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:04.244
Jack, you promised
to box his stuff up.

17
00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:08.627
I'll get to it.

18
00:04:13.977 --> 00:04:18.118
The rummage sale is on sunday.

19
00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:20.260
I'll get to it.

20
00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:27.058
Don't rush me, Anna.

21
00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.475
I don't try to slow you down.

22
00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:58.435
Need some money for lunch?

23
00:04:58.436 --> 00:05:00.057
No.

24
00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:03.060
How about a ride to school?

25
00:05:04.407 --> 00:05:05.546
No.

26
00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:07.928
Emily...

27
00:05:35.024 --> 00:05:38.648
We're moving to Chicago.

28
00:05:57.564 --> 00:06:01.808
Hi, Mrs. B.

29
00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:04.086
Hello, Tyler.

30
00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:07.987
My mom and I

31
00:06:07.988 --> 00:06:08.644
are going camping
this weekend.

32
00:06:08.645 --> 00:06:10.230
She bought me

33
00:06:10.231 --> 00:06:11.542
a new telescope
for the trip.

34
00:06:11.543 --> 00:06:13.786
That's okay, Tyler.
You can keep it.

35
00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:15.512
That way, you and your mom
will each have one.

36
00:06:15.513 --> 00:06:16.652
No problem.
We can share.

37
00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:21.069
I'll put it back
if you want.

38
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.795
I know
where it goes.

39
00:06:30.804 --> 00:06:34.979
Hiya, doc.

40
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.085
Hey, Tyler.

41
00:06:37.086 --> 00:06:38.258
I came by
to return Ricky's telescope.

42
00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.778
My mom bought me
a new one yesterday.

43
00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:42.022
So, my mom and I...

44
00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:45.887
Are headed up to Jasper lake
this weekend.

45
00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:47.648
Going camping.

46
00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:51.306
I seem to remember

47
00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:53.584
franny chen and Emily
skinny dipping in that lake.

48
00:06:53.585 --> 00:06:55.828
And I remember them
coming out

49
00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:58.175
and reaching for their towels.

50
00:06:58.176 --> 00:07:01.454
And all of a sudden,

51
00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.456
this wind
came up out of nowhere,

52
00:07:03.457 --> 00:07:04.113
and kept blowing those towels
toward the woods.

53
00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:07.771
Mother nature...

54
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120
Only it wasn't the wind,
was it, Tyler?

55
00:07:12.121 --> 00:07:15.364
It was fishing line...

56
00:07:15.365 --> 00:07:16.194
Fishing line
being reeled in

57
00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:17.953
by a couple of boys

58
00:07:17.954 --> 00:07:19.023
who were laughing
so hard,

59
00:07:19.024 --> 00:07:20.024
they blew their cover.

60
00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:23.234
Yeah.

61
00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:23.891
Well, you gotta admit,
it was one of our best.

62
00:07:25.617 --> 00:07:26.480
See ya around, doc.

63
00:07:29.863 --> 00:07:32.037
Hey, Tyler.

64
00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:35.419
You want to stay for pancakes?

65
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.972
I could whip up some batter.

66
00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:39.700
I'd love to,
but I've got to get to school.

67
00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:41.909
See you.

68
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.468
Bye, Mrs. B.

69
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.470
Bye, Tyler.

70
00:09:27.497 --> 00:09:32.571
You men ready
to make some noise?

71
00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.262
Grab a sign. Let's go.
Here you go. Take that one.

72
00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:36.402
What's on
the agenda, Marty?

73
00:09:36.403 --> 00:09:37.093
Word is, we're going
to have trouble

74
00:09:37.093 --> 00:09:38.025
with public works.

75
00:09:38.026 --> 00:09:39.439
That was inevitable.

76
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.303
I hear you.

77
00:09:41.304 --> 00:09:41.995
Cortez is back to complain
about staff for the hospital.

78
00:09:41.996 --> 00:09:44.721
Paul Montana wants

79
00:09:44.722 --> 00:09:45.550
a fast track permit
to cut down trees.

80
00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:47.447
Why does he think

81
00:09:47.448 --> 00:09:49.035
that he doesn't have to
follow the same rules

82
00:09:49.036 --> 00:09:49.658
that everyone else
has to follow?

83
00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:53.108
He's Paul Montana.

84
00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:53.731
And remind me
why I took this job.

85
00:09:53.732 --> 00:09:55.663
Well, before you,

86
00:09:55.664 --> 00:09:56.940
your father
was the mayor of cottonwood.

87
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:58.182
And before him,
your grandfather.

88
00:09:58.183 --> 00:09:59.805
So it's a defective gene.

89
00:09:59.806 --> 00:10:00.634
Yep. Something
like that.

90
00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:03.222
Mayor Davenport,

91
00:10:03.223 --> 00:10:04.361
we lose one more nurse
and we lose our accreditation.

92
00:10:04.362 --> 00:10:07.536
We've got to hire more staff.

93
00:10:07.537 --> 00:10:08.469
Good morning.

94
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.470
Good morning.

95
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:10.919
Morning, Anna!

96
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.576
I've got all
my paperwork in order...

97
00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:13.266
Geology study,

98
00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:14.854
environmental
impact report.

99
00:10:14.855 --> 00:10:16.476
Now, if you just
expedite my permit

100
00:10:16.477 --> 00:10:18.133
to clear trees
on cedar slope,

101
00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:20.377
I might me able to open up
three new lifts

102
00:10:20.378 --> 00:10:21.827
by the end of the season.

103
00:10:21.828 --> 00:10:23.760
Just what we need.

104
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:24.727
More broken bones
coming into the hospital.

105
00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:26.659
Gentlemen,

106
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.523
you've come to the right place
at the right time.

107
00:10:27.524 --> 00:10:30.352
Paul, you want

108
00:10:30.353 --> 00:10:30.802
your fast track permit
to cut trees,

109
00:10:31.492 --> 00:10:33.459
you got it.

110
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.736
Jason, you want more staff
at the hospital,

111
00:10:34.737 --> 00:10:36.151
it's yours.

112
00:10:36.152 --> 00:10:38.291
'Atta girl.

113
00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:39.361
How are you going to pay
for the extra shifts, Anna?

114
00:10:39.362 --> 00:10:40.949
I'm not going to.
Paul's is.

115
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.571
Excuse me, now.
One second, Anna. I am?

116
00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:44.815
Yes.

117
00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:45.714
By agreeing to a 10% surcharge
on all lift tickets.

118
00:10:45.715 --> 00:10:47.507
Wait a minute. No way.

119
00:10:47.508 --> 00:10:49.233
The only reason
people come here to ski

120
00:10:49.234 --> 00:10:49.649
is because it's still cheaper
than Aspen and vail.

121
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.305
Okay.

122
00:10:52.548 --> 00:10:53.652
We'll put it
on the council's winter agenda

123
00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.308
and open it up
for public comment.

124
00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:57.483
Well, that's just great.

125
00:10:57.484 --> 00:11:00.797
Then Millie wildflower
and all her hippy friends

126
00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:02.177
will get up there and say
what a horrible person I am

127
00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:03.834
for tearing down
all the helpless trees.

128
00:11:03.835 --> 00:11:04.594
We'll go with the tax hike.

129
00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:08.494
10% to the hospital.

130
00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:09.909
Good choice.

131
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:12.879
Looks like
you've got some fans.

132
00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:23.683
We've got
a right to be here, sheriff.

133
00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:26.374
You've got a right

134
00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:26.996
to be 50 feet
from city hall.

135
00:11:26.997 --> 00:11:28.410
Now move!

136
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:30.033
Chief Corbin!

137
00:11:30.034 --> 00:11:31.586
What if he has an appointment
with the mayor?

138
00:11:31.587 --> 00:11:33.037
They're too close
to government buildings.

139
00:11:34.107 --> 00:11:35.866
That's the law.
You know that, Anna.

140
00:11:35.867 --> 00:11:37.696
Well, if you back off,

141
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.318
I'm sure they'd be happy
to move down the street.

142
00:11:39.319 --> 00:11:40.527
You're still in charge.

143
00:11:46.119 --> 00:11:49.709
There you are.

144
00:11:50.364 --> 00:11:52.814
For you.

145
00:11:52.815 --> 00:11:54.402
Douglas, remember

146
00:11:54.403 --> 00:11:55.437
when you were
in the fifth grade,

147
00:11:55.438 --> 00:11:57.267
and Mr. Hall

148
00:11:57.268 --> 00:11:58.302
made you clean up
the entire school yard,

149
00:11:58.303 --> 00:11:58.925
because you put
hot sauce in his coffee?

150
00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:00.616
I do.

151
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:02.582
Well, that wasn't fair.

152
00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:04.964
We put you up to it.

153
00:12:04.965 --> 00:12:06.414
We should have all
been punished.

154
00:12:06.415 --> 00:12:07.656
So you owe me one,
is that it?

155
00:12:07.657 --> 00:12:10.073
Douglas, some things
have slipped past me

156
00:12:10.074 --> 00:12:14.249
since Ricky's... death.

157
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.838
Look, Anna, we're not
pointing our signs at you.

158
00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:19.945
I know that.

159
00:12:19.946 --> 00:12:21.843
But the city council

160
00:12:21.844 --> 00:12:22.948
should've ratified
your contract months ago.

161
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:24.156
And I haven't done
enough to help.

162
00:12:24.157 --> 00:12:25.710
Marty and I,

163
00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:28.677
we'll make them
make good on their promise,

164
00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:30.438
if it's the last thing
we do in my term.

165
00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:31.681
Your term
or the next guy's,

166
00:12:33.028 --> 00:12:33.960
we can't go back to work
until it's signed.

167
00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:36.721
We can't do it, Anna.

168
00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:38.654
All right, guys,
make some noise!

169
00:12:41.346 --> 00:12:43.106
Empty promises, empty trucks,
empty promises, empty trucks.

170
00:12:43.107 --> 00:12:47.179
Empty promises,
empty trucks...

171
00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.526
Updating our top story...

172
00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:51.631
There are several
meteorites

173
00:12:51.632 --> 00:12:53.288
hitting different parts
of North America.

174
00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:55.152
One has just hit a gas field
on the east coast,

175
00:12:55.153 --> 00:12:56.327
and another has just landed
on the outskirts of Kansas.

176
00:12:57.535 --> 00:12:59.399
Martin Reese
reporting from Kansas.

177
00:13:05.612 --> 00:13:09.857
So how're those new cookies
selling for you, son?

178
00:13:09.858 --> 00:13:13.033
They're not.

179
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.414
They're just sitting here
turning to stone.

180
00:13:15.415 --> 00:13:18.451
I can't get 'em in fast enough.

181
00:13:18.452 --> 00:13:20.246
Guess they go better
with coffee than with beer.

182
00:13:20.247 --> 00:13:21.317
Hey, listen, they're
having a guest chef

183
00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:23.284
at the lodge
on sunday night.

184
00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:25.458
Indian food.
You want to come?

185
00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:27.495
You've never had saag paneer,
have you?

186
00:13:27.496 --> 00:13:29.014
Invite me when they're
serving prime rib.

187
00:13:29.015 --> 00:13:29.705
Where's your
sense of adventure?

188
00:13:30.568 --> 00:13:31.603
Hello, Anna.

189
00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:36.435
Morning, Mr. Reed.

190
00:13:36.436 --> 00:13:38.057
Is Emily working for you
this afternoon?

191
00:13:38.058 --> 00:13:39.921
Sure is.

192
00:13:39.922 --> 00:13:41.405
Good thing
for me, too.

193
00:13:41.406 --> 00:13:41.959
The receipts always go up
when she comes in.

194
00:13:43.236 --> 00:13:44.202
Missed a spot.

195
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.345
You want
to pitch in?

196
00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:52.692
Maybe, after my rounds.

197
00:13:52.693 --> 00:13:55.454
You make me nervous.

198
00:13:55.455 --> 00:13:57.283
You want to get started
on the roll-ups?

199
00:13:57.284 --> 00:13:57.837
I'm talking to all
the city council members.

200
00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:00.046
We have a problem, Dalton,
and you know it.

201
00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:02.910
What, those public workers
on strike?

202
00:14:02.911 --> 00:14:05.119
Hell, one afternoon in Denver,

203
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.430
I could round up a dozen men

204
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:07.846
who'd be happy to earn
what we pay.

205
00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:08.640
We pay less than
what we promised.

206
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.057
You saw the budget, Anna.

207
00:14:12.058 --> 00:14:13.127
Big snows
didn't happen last winter.

208
00:14:13.128 --> 00:14:16.337
Big tourism didn't either.

209
00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:17.856
Well, you managed
to give yourselves a raise.

210
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.789
First one in 10 years.

211
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.446
Hey, folks, dj Dan here,
and I have a confession to make.

212
00:14:22.447 --> 00:14:27.141
I consulted a vedic astrologer

213
00:14:27.142 --> 00:14:28.315
to find out if I should have

214
00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:31.007
eggs or oatmeal
for breakfast this morning.

215
00:14:31.008 --> 00:14:34.631
She told me
not only to skip breakfast

216
00:14:34.632 --> 00:14:37.254
but that I should
stay in bed all day.

217
00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:40.395
Which is why I drove
straight to work.

218
00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:42.018
Of course,
then I heard a report

219
00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:45.504
of a meteorite

220
00:14:45.505 --> 00:14:46.264
hitting a gas field
on the east coast.

221
00:14:46.265 --> 00:14:49.025
And I can see online

222
00:14:49.026 --> 00:14:51.751
that another one

223
00:14:51.752 --> 00:14:53.167
has just slammed into
a farmhouse in Kansas.

224
00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:56.377
Maybe I should have stayed
in bed after all.

225
00:14:56.378 --> 00:14:59.518
Which is faster,
a bullet or a meteorite?

226
00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:02.486
Meteorite.

227
00:15:02.487 --> 00:15:03.936
Come on, em,
what's your guess?

228
00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:05.144
Bullet.

229
00:15:05.145 --> 00:15:06.421
Meteorite wins, at...

230
00:15:06.422 --> 00:15:08.872
Seth!

231
00:15:08.873 --> 00:15:10.149
I told you.

232
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.875
Which gives more warning?

233
00:15:11.876 --> 00:15:13.394
It's a meteorite.

234
00:15:13.395 --> 00:15:14.223
Bullet. You see
the guy pull a gun.

235
00:15:14.223 --> 00:15:15.017
You hear
the Sonic boom.

236
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:17.261
Meteorite.
You hear the Sonic boom.

237
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:20.747
Go home
and write fast.

238
00:15:24.302 --> 00:15:26.339
I'm not answering her.

239
00:15:27.064 --> 00:15:29.548
Gee, that's too bad.

240
00:15:29.549 --> 00:15:31.032
'Cause if you don't
finish the letter,

241
00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:32.240
we can't go out later,

242
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:32.828
and it's my turn
to pick the plan.

243
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.900
Em, I don't know...
I...

244
00:15:39.593 --> 00:15:41.733
It's okay to be nervous.

245
00:15:42.493 --> 00:15:43.631
I'm not nervous.

246
00:15:43.632 --> 00:15:44.529
I...

247
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.323
Seth...

248
00:15:46.324 --> 00:15:46.807
We've got less than
two months together.

249
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:50.950
Don't you want to make
the most of it?

250
00:15:54.194 --> 00:15:57.991
I'm gonna miss you so much.

251
00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:08.828
I think
I can get off early.

252
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:10.279
I'll call you later.

253
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.875
Latte, extra foam.

254
00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:21.704
And a cookie monster.

255
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:26.191
Double-latte, extra foam.

256
00:16:26.192 --> 00:16:27.675
And this is for you
on the house.

257
00:16:27.676 --> 00:16:30.850
Enjoy.

258
00:16:30.851 --> 00:16:32.197
Whose house is it on?

259
00:16:32.198 --> 00:16:33.061
What, now you're
giving away my cookies?

260
00:16:34.165 --> 00:16:34.717
Yep. And that's why
they're buying

261
00:16:36.064 --> 00:16:37.065
a three-and-a-half-dollar
latte here

262
00:16:38.307 --> 00:16:40.481
instead of a 99-cent cup of Joe
at the diner.

263
00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:42.484
I knew there was
a reason I hired you.

264
00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:02.123
Hi.

265
00:17:02.124 --> 00:17:03.022
Emily, we need to talk.

266
00:17:05.852 --> 00:17:06.646
Do I barge in
on you at work?

267
00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:10.235
No, you don't.

268
00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:11.375
Then we'll talk at home.

269
00:17:14.757 --> 00:17:19.313
Emily, I want you to know
why I took this job.

270
00:17:19.314 --> 00:17:23.213
What difference does it make?

271
00:17:23.214 --> 00:17:24.559
It's done, isn't it?

272
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.597
Yes.

273
00:17:27.598 --> 00:17:29.633
You said we wouldn't move
until I finished high school.

274
00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:33.637
That's all I wanted, mom.
That's all I wanted.

275
00:17:33.638 --> 00:17:35.846
It's not only about
what you want, Emily.

276
00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:38.159
Your father and I have decided.

277
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.678
Dad doesn't want
to move.

278
00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:40.851
Did you even ask him?

279
00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.025
He may not want to.

280
00:17:42.026 --> 00:17:44.545
But he needs to.

281
00:17:44.546 --> 00:17:45.547
We all need to.

282
00:17:48.308 --> 00:17:51.897
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to lose a child?

283
00:17:51.898 --> 00:17:54.349
I feel him all around me...

284
00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.695
Tilting back in his chair
at the breakfast table,

285
00:17:56.696 --> 00:17:57.731
just to tease me.

286
00:17:58.698 --> 00:17:59.801
On the front porch.

287
00:17:59.802 --> 00:18:00.596
On the sidewalks in town.

288
00:18:00.597 --> 00:18:01.735
It is so real.

289
00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:04.116
It is so painfully real,

290
00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:04.600
I can't stand
to live here anymore.

291
00:18:05.981 --> 00:18:06.844
I feel him, too, mom.

292
00:18:10.503 --> 00:18:12.436
It's the best part of my day.

293
00:18:59.103 --> 00:19:03.313
Now, I am going to drop off
the videos.

294
00:19:03.314 --> 00:19:05.971
You want to come?

295
00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:07.111
Okay.

296
00:19:10.218 --> 00:19:11.735
I will take that as a no.

297
00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:16.084
I'm also going to
run into the market.

298
00:19:16.085 --> 00:19:18.777
Any requests?

299
00:19:18.778 --> 00:19:21.642
Maybe chocolate milk,
chocolate cookies,

300
00:19:21.643 --> 00:19:23.230
chocolate almonds,
chocolate kisses.

301
00:19:23.231 --> 00:19:26.164
Any reasonable requests?

302
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.235
White chocolate,
dark chocolate.

303
00:19:28.236 --> 00:19:29.444
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

304
00:19:32.136 --> 00:19:35.657
These pictures
are amazing, Anna.

305
00:19:36.727 --> 00:19:39.315
What a great historical record.

306
00:19:39.316 --> 00:19:41.040
They're a terrific contribution
to the museum.

307
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:43.215
It's so generous
of you.

308
00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:45.355
But these are
family treasures.

309
00:19:45.356 --> 00:19:46.323
Are you sure you want
to leave them with me?

310
00:19:46.324 --> 00:19:47.909
I know you'll keep them safe.

311
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.912
Look at those gams.

312
00:19:50.913 --> 00:19:53.743
What?

313
00:19:53.744 --> 00:19:54.331
Getting ready for
your first press conference.

314
00:19:54.332 --> 00:19:56.608
Come on!

315
00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:57.092
I don't know
how that one got in there.

316
00:20:00.544 --> 00:20:02.786
Listen, Anna,
I want you to know

317
00:20:02.787 --> 00:20:04.719
I tried to talk Douglas
out of this strike.

318
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.239
To at least wait until
you're out of office.

319
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.931
But he can get
real bullheaded sometimes.

320
00:20:09.932 --> 00:20:12.313
I hope he isn't making life
too hard for you.

321
00:20:12.314 --> 00:20:14.109
Not at all, Miriam.

322
00:20:15.283 --> 00:20:15.869
He's just trying
to make it better for you.

323
00:21:00.189 --> 00:21:04.848
I think it hit main street!

324
00:21:04.849 --> 00:21:06.541
Call the fire department!

325
00:21:13.582 --> 00:21:17.654
Help!

326
00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:20.899
Miriam!

327
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.832
Help!

328
00:21:22.833 --> 00:21:23.627
Can you move
at all?

329
00:21:26.871 --> 00:21:29.079
I can't.

330
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:29.736
Okay, okay.
You'll be okay.

331
00:21:33.464 --> 00:21:38.399
Okay...

332
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:38.883
I have to leave you
for just for a minute.

333
00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:42.541
I'm going to
get help, okay?

334
00:21:42.542 --> 00:21:44.199
Help!

335
00:21:45.994 --> 00:21:47.443
Help!

336
00:21:47.444 --> 00:21:48.651
Anna!

337
00:21:48.652 --> 00:21:49.859
Anna!

338
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.170
Douglas!

339
00:21:51.171 --> 00:21:52.310
What can I do?

340
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:53.208
Miriam! Where's my wife?

341
00:21:53.209 --> 00:21:56.141
Janet, call 911.

342
00:21:56.142 --> 00:21:57.280
Get an ambulance
and firefighters

343
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:58.178
to the visitors center.

344
00:21:58.178 --> 00:21:59.041
Miriam's hurt.

345
00:21:59.042 --> 00:22:01.180
Okay.

346
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:02.044
Okay, sweetheart,
breathe.

347
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.530
Just breathe.

348
00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:07.118
An ambulance
is on its way.

349
00:22:17.957 --> 00:22:22.098
Anna, are you okay?

350
00:22:22.099 --> 00:22:24.411
I'm fine.

351
00:22:24.412 --> 00:22:25.758
The paramedics
are on their way in.

352
00:22:26.862 --> 00:22:28.622
Call Jason
at the hospital,

353
00:22:28.623 --> 00:22:29.382
warn him we've got
injured coming in.

354
00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:31.418
Get Clint Corbin
over here.

355
00:22:31.419 --> 00:22:33.385
And try to reach
tad wingate

356
00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:34.387
at emergency response
in Denver.

357
00:22:41.946 --> 00:22:45.605
My god!

358
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.585
Tyler!

359
00:23:01.656 --> 00:23:06.107
He's in the back!

360
00:23:06.108 --> 00:23:07.108
I can't get him from here!

361
00:23:07.109 --> 00:23:08.214
Give me that!

362
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.529
Step back, step back!

363
00:23:15.946 --> 00:23:20.363
Marty, help me roll him over.

364
00:23:20.364 --> 00:23:21.813
Marty, support his spine.

365
00:23:21.814 --> 00:23:24.643
Now, you start to pull him out.

366
00:23:24.644 --> 00:23:26.093
I'll take his legs
so we can get him out faster.

367
00:23:26.094 --> 00:23:27.957
I got him, I got him.

368
00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:29.408
Gently... gently.

369
00:23:31.133 --> 00:23:32.479
Tyler.

370
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.273
It's okay.
It's okay, Tyler.

371
00:23:33.274 --> 00:23:35.033
Grab his legs.

372
00:23:35.034 --> 00:23:35.759
I'm right here,
I'm right here.

373
00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:36.725
One, two... three!

374
00:23:36.726 --> 00:23:40.107
Come on, Tyler.

375
00:23:40.108 --> 00:23:41.591
Okay...

376
00:23:41.592 --> 00:23:42.696
Is he okay?

377
00:23:42.697 --> 00:23:43.594
Watch his head.

378
00:23:43.595 --> 00:23:44.870
Is he okay?

379
00:23:44.871 --> 00:23:46.425
We've got a pulse.

380
00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:48.150
He's breathing.

381
00:23:49.393 --> 00:23:51.014
We have got to get him
to the hospital now.

382
00:23:51.015 --> 00:23:52.257
It's going to be okay.

383
00:23:55.157 --> 00:23:58.678
We've got a little
boy over here.

384
00:23:59.714 --> 00:24:01.128
He inhaled a lot of smoke.

385
00:24:01.129 --> 00:24:03.407
This is his mother, Janet.

386
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.168
Carl!

387
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.378
Anna,
there have been many strikes...

388
00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:11.621
Small fires
on all sides of town.

389
00:24:11.622 --> 00:24:14.555
Several houses
are now threatened.

390
00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:16.143
But I only have
so many fire trucks.

391
00:24:16.144 --> 00:24:18.386
We have to make
some fast choices.

392
00:24:18.387 --> 00:24:19.940
You have to leave
the truck here.

393
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:21.148
We have to protect the town.

394
00:24:21.149 --> 00:24:21.977
No. You get this one
under control,

395
00:24:21.978 --> 00:24:24.531
and leave
a skeleton crew,

396
00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:26.325
and get your trucks
across town.

397
00:24:26.326 --> 00:24:27.672
This place is going to go up.

398
00:24:27.673 --> 00:24:29.190
We have to
put our resources

399
00:24:29.191 --> 00:24:30.191
into saving
people's homes first.

400
00:24:32.436 --> 00:24:33.781
Listen up, chance of plans.

401
00:24:33.782 --> 00:24:35.265
We're going to redirect...

402
00:24:35.266 --> 00:24:36.819
Did the hospital get hit?

403
00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.029
Hey, you've reached
Emily's cell.

404
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.893
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

405
00:24:40.894 --> 00:24:44.447
Emily, it's mom.

406
00:24:44.448 --> 00:24:45.691
I just wanted to make sure
that you're okay.

407
00:24:46.968 --> 00:24:47.831
Please call me
when you get this.

408
00:24:47.832 --> 00:24:49.210
I love you.

409
00:24:49.211 --> 00:24:50.246
It's Jason Cortez.

410
00:24:50.247 --> 00:24:52.731
Jason, it's Anna.

411
00:24:52.732 --> 00:24:54.595
We've got injured coming in,
two critical,

412
00:24:54.596 --> 00:24:56.459
and I don't know
how many others.

413
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.565
Right by
the front door.

414
00:24:58.566 --> 00:24:59.704
Anna, we've got word
of several hits in town.

415
00:24:59.705 --> 00:25:02.500
Call in
everyone from every shift.

416
00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:04.743
Get a hold of Kevin Simon
and Dina McCoy.

417
00:25:04.744 --> 00:25:06.883
Tell them
they're not retired anymore.

418
00:25:06.884 --> 00:25:08.575
We need more than nurses, Anna.

419
00:25:08.576 --> 00:25:09.473
We need doctors
who have worked in e.R.S.

420
00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:11.405
All right, hand on a sec'.

421
00:25:11.406 --> 00:25:12.648
Listen, I'll deal with you
in a second.

422
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:13.994
Listen, I'm handling
a situation right now.

423
00:25:13.995 --> 00:25:14.996
Thank you, Marty.

424
00:25:28.561 --> 00:25:33.254
Jack, they're going
to need help in the E.R.

425
00:25:33.255 --> 00:25:35.394
I'm not even on staff anymore.

426
00:25:35.395 --> 00:25:35.844
It doesn't matter,
this is an emergency.

427
00:25:37.121 --> 00:25:39.364
I hear the new doctor's
very well trained.

428
00:25:39.365 --> 00:25:41.021
The new doctor
is one person.

429
00:25:41.022 --> 00:25:41.816
Anna, I haven't treated
any patients in half a year.

430
00:25:43.058 --> 00:25:44.715
Ricky's death
was not your fault.

431
00:25:45.613 --> 00:25:49.339
I don't know that.

432
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.548
Maybe it was something I did
or didn't do.

433
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.447
You want to look
for blame?

434
00:25:53.448 --> 00:25:55.035
Well, then,
why don't you start

435
00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:55.726
with the driver
of the truck?

436
00:25:55.727 --> 00:25:56.727
He was the one

437
00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:59.280
who didn't like
the song on his radio,

438
00:25:59.281 --> 00:26:00.248
so he took his eyes
off the road

439
00:26:00.249 --> 00:26:01.559
so he could
change the station.

440
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.630
Or how about the owner
of the minimart,

441
00:26:03.631 --> 00:26:05.183
where he got
his coffee that morning.

442
00:26:05.184 --> 00:26:07.703
Maybe
he watered it down.

443
00:26:07.704 --> 00:26:09.049
Or what about me?

444
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.328
I was the one

445
00:26:12.329 --> 00:26:14.572
that wouldn't let Ricky
out of the house

446
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:15.642
until he double knotted
his laces.

447
00:26:15.643 --> 00:26:17.609
That took
20 seconds, Jack...

448
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.438
20 seconds he could have used
to get across the road.

449
00:26:19.439 --> 00:26:23.822
There are people
who are hurt right now,

450
00:26:23.823 --> 00:26:26.411
who might die,

451
00:26:26.412 --> 00:26:27.068
if you don't walk back
into the E.R. and help them.

452
00:26:27.069 --> 00:26:30.277
Tyler is one of them.

453
00:26:30.278 --> 00:26:32.175
Who do you think
Ricky would want

454
00:26:32.176 --> 00:26:32.936
treating his best friend?

455
00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:48.467
What is going on here?

456
00:26:48.468 --> 00:26:49.228
I told you to prep
warm saline dressing

457
00:26:49.229 --> 00:26:51.643
and start an I.V. Line.

458
00:26:51.644 --> 00:26:53.058
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but family waits out front.

459
00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:54.301
And let's get some meds
on board.

460
00:26:54.302 --> 00:26:55.786
And why didn't anyone tell me

461
00:26:57.167 --> 00:26:58.305
this man's not responding
to the atropine?

462
00:26:58.306 --> 00:26:59.444
Give him another milligram.

463
00:26:59.445 --> 00:27:00.928
Doc!
Doc, you gotta help my wife.

464
00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:02.965
She was in the explosion.

465
00:27:02.966 --> 00:27:03.725
She's lost a lot of blood,
and she says she's dizzy, too.

466
00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:06.209
It's all right.

467
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.245
Excuse me.

468
00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:09.247
Where is the pain?

469
00:27:09.248 --> 00:27:10.214
It's in my stomach.
The side.

470
00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:12.353
Do you feel nauseous?

471
00:27:12.354 --> 00:27:13.045
Okay, nurse,
take her to bed four.

472
00:27:13.046 --> 00:27:15.184
Type and cross

473
00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:15.910
and do
an ultrasound of her abdomen.

474
00:27:15.911 --> 00:27:17.289
And please start an I.V.

475
00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.566
Sir, you have to
wait out front.

476
00:27:18.567 --> 00:27:20.258
No, I'm going
to stay with her.

477
00:27:20.259 --> 00:27:21.053
Sir, you want to do
what's best for your wife,

478
00:27:21.054 --> 00:27:22.294
you wait out front.

479
00:27:22.295 --> 00:27:23.882
Where is Dr. Coleman?

480
00:27:23.883 --> 00:27:25.090
Isn't he scheduled
for a shift right now?

481
00:27:25.091 --> 00:27:26.609
Dr. Coleman
lives in Boulder.

482
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.197
He's been called in
to the trauma center there.

483
00:27:30.545 --> 00:27:34.169
And you are...

484
00:27:35.205 --> 00:27:35.757
Dr. Baxter,
this is Dr. Ryan.

485
00:27:37.103 --> 00:27:39.898
Dr. Baxter used to
work here in E.R.

486
00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:41.693
Great, it's about time
I had some back-up.

487
00:27:41.694 --> 00:27:43.661
Look, I haven't seen
half these people yet.

488
00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:45.663
Why don't you take burn
and pulmonary.

489
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:46.285
I'll handle cardiac,
trauma and lacerations.

490
00:27:50.047 --> 00:27:54.464
So what've we got?

491
00:27:54.465 --> 00:27:55.845
It's good to see you, Jack.

492
00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:58.054
Right over here.

493
00:27:58.055 --> 00:27:59.642
It's a meteor storm, Anna.

494
00:27:59.643 --> 00:28:00.506
We've had hits in six counties
in Colorado alone.

495
00:28:00.507 --> 00:28:02.956
What caused it?

496
00:28:02.957 --> 00:28:05.337
Hard to say.

497
00:28:05.338 --> 00:28:07.132
Meteors are flying around US
all the time.

498
00:28:07.133 --> 00:28:09.100
They just don't usually
get close enough

499
00:28:09.101 --> 00:28:10.860
to be sucked in
by the earth's gravity.

500
00:28:10.861 --> 00:28:12.344
Why didn't they burn up
in the atmosphere?

501
00:28:12.345 --> 00:28:13.863
Same reason
the shuttle

502
00:28:13.864 --> 00:28:14.727
doesn't burn up
on its way home.

503
00:28:14.728 --> 00:28:16.659
Speed.

504
00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.109
And the iron content
of these stones.

505
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.145
They're mostly metal.

506
00:28:20.146 --> 00:28:21.113
They come in like cluster bombs.

507
00:28:21.114 --> 00:28:22.424
With no warning?

508
00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:25.772
NASA tracks only 7%
of near-earth objects.

509
00:28:25.773 --> 00:28:27.808
These are part of
the 93% they don't.

510
00:28:27.809 --> 00:28:28.810
Is it over?

511
00:28:30.087 --> 00:28:31.329
No, Anna.
It's just beginning.

512
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:33.227
An alert's been issued

513
00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:34.195
across the entire
western United States

514
00:28:34.196 --> 00:28:36.127
for the next three hours.

515
00:28:36.128 --> 00:28:37.645
What am I supposed to do?

516
00:28:37.646 --> 00:28:40.718
What's protocol
for a meteor storm?

517
00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:41.960
Activate
your disaster plan.

518
00:28:41.961 --> 00:28:43.928
Already did that.

519
00:28:43.929 --> 00:28:45.101
Tell people to stay indoors,
away from windows.

520
00:28:45.102 --> 00:28:46.794
And?

521
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.623
Hope it passes you by.

522
00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:58.564
Tyler's on 100% O2
and O2 sat is at 92.

523
00:29:01.325 --> 00:29:04.777
He has partial thickness burns
on his right arm,

524
00:29:06.123 --> 00:29:07.952
several lacerations
on his chest.

525
00:29:07.953 --> 00:29:10.161
B.p.'s 90 over 60.

526
00:29:10.162 --> 00:29:11.473
Do you know this boy?

527
00:29:13.959 --> 00:29:14.753
He was my son's best friend.

528
00:29:15.857 --> 00:29:17.340
He should be my patient, then.

529
00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:20.586
No. He's going to be mine.

530
00:29:24.832 --> 00:29:29.283
Morphine's not holding.
Up him to 1 milligram.

531
00:29:29.284 --> 00:29:31.700
Maintain O2-7 94%.

532
00:29:36.257 --> 00:29:40.054
Hey, Tyler, it's doc.

533
00:29:40.986 --> 00:29:44.609
You're in the emergency room.

534
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:45.473
It's going to be okay.
I'm going to take care of you.

535
00:29:55.138 --> 00:29:56.690
Come on, Emily.

536
00:29:56.691 --> 00:29:57.588
Answer the phone, honey.

537
00:30:01.316 --> 00:30:05.044
Answer the phone.

538
00:30:07.736 --> 00:30:10.532
Hey, you've reached
Emily's cell...

539
00:30:14.088 --> 00:30:18.746
Your wife
has a ruptured spleen.

540
00:30:18.747 --> 00:30:20.196
We're giving her blood
to stabilize her.

541
00:30:20.197 --> 00:30:21.197
Just tell me
when I can see her.

542
00:30:21.198 --> 00:30:22.785
Well, the plan is

543
00:30:22.786 --> 00:30:23.718
to transport her
to Boulder for surgery.

544
00:30:23.719 --> 00:30:25.029
When can I see her?

545
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.202
You can see her
right now.

546
00:30:26.203 --> 00:30:27.101
She's in the room
back there.

547
00:30:27.102 --> 00:30:28.722
That's all I want.

548
00:30:28.723 --> 00:30:29.689
And could I have a coffee...
Black this time, please.

549
00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:33.141
Hey.

550
00:30:36.075 --> 00:30:38.076
Hi, baby.

551
00:30:38.077 --> 00:30:40.044
How are you?

552
00:30:40.045 --> 00:30:42.460
Listen, you remember,

553
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:44.117
you said you wanted

554
00:30:44.118 --> 00:30:45.532
to get out of town
for a couple of days?

555
00:30:45.533 --> 00:30:47.431
Looks like you're getting
a free trip to Boulder.

556
00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:49.570
We'll have to see
how he responds.

557
00:30:49.571 --> 00:30:51.538
And Miriam?

558
00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:52.815
She needs blood,
but she's o-negative.

559
00:30:52.816 --> 00:30:54.437
We only have
two units on hand.

560
00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:55.887
Well, how long will it last?

561
00:30:55.888 --> 00:30:57.095
Couple hours at best.

562
00:30:57.096 --> 00:30:59.166
My god!

563
00:30:59.167 --> 00:31:00.236
Anna, we need a helicopter.

564
00:31:00.237 --> 00:31:03.101
Jason's gotten nowhere.

565
00:31:03.102 --> 00:31:03.862
Can you work on that for me?

566
00:31:04.621 --> 00:31:05.932
Of course.

567
00:31:05.933 --> 00:31:07.312
Could somebody

568
00:31:07.313 --> 00:31:08.038
get Marty in here
for me?

569
00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:10.315
Have you heard from Emily?

570
00:31:10.316 --> 00:31:11.489
No, I just get
her voicemail.

571
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.456
Why won't she answer?

572
00:31:13.078 --> 00:31:15.044
I don't know.

573
00:31:15.045 --> 00:31:16.080
Maybe her phone's off.

574
00:31:16.081 --> 00:31:17.219
Don't worry about her.

575
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.323
As long as she's at the cafe,

576
00:31:18.324 --> 00:31:19.222
she's in
the safest place in town.

577
00:31:21.017 --> 00:31:22.189
Hope street
hasn't been hit, right?

578
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.329
Tyler. Stat.

579
00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:26.297
I've got to go.

580
00:31:26.298 --> 00:31:27.161
Anna, what
do you need?

581
00:31:29.577 --> 00:31:30.680
We've got to find a medivac.

582
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:32.580
I'm on it.

583
00:31:33.822 --> 00:31:34.858
What's his sat?

584
00:31:37.965 --> 00:31:39.966
57.

585
00:31:39.967 --> 00:31:41.864
He's getting airway edema
from the heat and smoke.

586
00:31:41.865 --> 00:31:43.176
I'll call rt stat.
Get him on a vent.

587
00:31:43.177 --> 00:31:44.729
And get an abg.

588
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.799
Yes, sir.

589
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.835
My god.

590
00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:58.087
I understand that you are
in the middle of an emergency,

591
00:31:58.088 --> 00:32:00.434
and so are we,

592
00:32:00.435 --> 00:32:02.436
and we need a helicopter.

593
00:32:02.437 --> 00:32:03.644
Well, can't you take
more than one patient?

594
00:32:03.645 --> 00:32:05.646
We are trying
flight for life.

595
00:32:05.647 --> 00:32:06.993
The mayor is on the phone
with them right now.

596
00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:07.787
We are right on your way.

597
00:32:12.827 --> 00:32:16.486
Breath sounds are equal.

598
00:32:24.183 --> 00:32:27.842
Secure.

599
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.712
Order a chest X-ray
for placement stat.

600
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:39.647
He's good.

601
00:32:48.587 --> 00:32:53.177
Hi. Your double-shot
Espresso, sir.

602
00:32:53.178 --> 00:32:55.075
And I forgot
your napkin.

603
00:32:57.182 --> 00:32:58.252
Get away from the window!

604
00:33:18.858 --> 00:33:22.965
Hello?

605
00:33:22.966 --> 00:33:24.691
Hello?

606
00:33:24.692 --> 00:33:25.658
Hello?

607
00:33:25.658 --> 00:33:26.521
Vents down.

608
00:33:26.522 --> 00:33:28.799
Geez.

609
00:33:30.353 --> 00:33:31.732
Everyone, listen to me, please.
It's very important...

610
00:33:31.733 --> 00:33:33.389
I need a pen light.

611
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.770
Top drawer.
Other side.

612
00:33:34.771 --> 00:33:35.909
The hospital
has a back-up generator.

613
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.774
And a bag.

614
00:33:38.533 --> 00:33:39.569
I've got it.

615
00:34:10.151 --> 00:34:13.775
Marty, my cell is out.

616
00:34:15.018 --> 00:34:16.363
We've got to try
to reach Bob hanson,

617
00:34:16.364 --> 00:34:16.916
find out how extensive
the outages are.

618
00:34:17.641 --> 00:34:19.366
Everyone else,

619
00:34:19.367 --> 00:34:20.954
we'll monitor channel 9,
talk on 4.

620
00:34:20.955 --> 00:34:23.785
Pack up your laptops
and join me at the hospital.

621
00:34:24.786 --> 00:34:26.822
They've got back-up power.

622
00:34:26.823 --> 00:34:28.099
We'll run our operations
from there.

623
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:28.997
Okay, vents working.

624
00:34:29.584 --> 00:34:30.929
Get him back on.

625
00:34:30.930 --> 00:34:32.276
Yes! Yes!

626
00:34:32.277 --> 00:34:34.312
Thank you, everyone.

627
00:34:34.313 --> 00:34:36.659
Any oxygen?

628
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.213
What settings
do you want?

629
00:34:38.214 --> 00:34:39.491
Let's just control it.
Volume 350.

630
00:34:45.186 --> 00:34:49.120
Set it for 50.
He did fine on the bag.

631
00:34:49.121 --> 00:34:50.847
He's breathing.

632
00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:54.194
It's working.

633
00:34:54.195 --> 00:34:56.646
How bad's your damage?

634
00:34:59.338 --> 00:35:00.236
From what we've been
able to piece together,

635
00:35:00.237 --> 00:35:01.477
the damage is extensive.

636
00:35:01.478 --> 00:35:03.100
Main street is a war zone.

637
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.308
Power plant's gone.

638
00:35:04.309 --> 00:35:07.276
It's horrible.

639
00:35:07.277 --> 00:35:08.244
How many times
have you been hit?

640
00:35:08.245 --> 00:35:09.347
We've had multiple strikes.

641
00:35:09.348 --> 00:35:10.797
We've got no power,
no phones.

642
00:35:10.798 --> 00:35:13.351
Anna, we just lost

643
00:35:13.352 --> 00:35:14.732
a 40-foot section
of road across both lanes.

644
00:35:14.733 --> 00:35:15.871
And no way off
this mountain.

645
00:35:15.872 --> 00:35:17.907
We just lost highway 40.

646
00:35:17.908 --> 00:35:19.737
What's your patient status
at the E.R.?

647
00:35:19.738 --> 00:35:21.290
I've got two critical
who are in need of transport,

648
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:23.672
but I can't get
anybody up here.

649
00:35:23.673 --> 00:35:25.260
Let me contact
the air force bases,

650
00:35:25.261 --> 00:35:26.847
see if I can get you
a chopper.

651
00:35:26.848 --> 00:35:28.573
Is there anything else
I need to know?

652
00:35:28.574 --> 00:35:30.989
It isn't over, Anna.

653
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.232
There's more coming.

654
00:35:32.233 --> 00:35:33.923
Jack!

655
00:35:33.924 --> 00:35:36.650
Where is she going?

656
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:37.204
I'm sending her to Boulder
by ambulance.

657
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.102
She can't wait
any longer.

658
00:35:39.103 --> 00:35:40.654
You can't.

659
00:35:40.655 --> 00:35:41.690
There's a piece of the highway
missing.

660
00:35:41.691 --> 00:35:42.932
There's no way through.

661
00:35:42.933 --> 00:35:44.589
Everyone, listen up!

662
00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:45.901
We're about to get
another wave of injured in.

663
00:35:45.902 --> 00:35:48.317
Where from?

664
00:35:48.318 --> 00:35:50.216
Hope street.
Reed's underground cafe.

665
00:35:50.217 --> 00:35:52.460
Emily!

666
00:35:52.943 --> 00:35:54.462
Emily!

667
00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:06.128
You can't go this way, Anna.

668
00:36:06.129 --> 00:36:08.234
I have to.

669
00:36:08.235 --> 00:36:09.476
The front stairway
has collapsed.

670
00:36:09.477 --> 00:36:09.960
Anna,
you've got a chance over here,

671
00:36:10.961 --> 00:36:12.238
through the service entrance.

672
00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:14.481
The building was hit
really hard, Anna.

673
00:36:14.482 --> 00:36:16.034
There's a lot of people
trapped.

674
00:36:16.035 --> 00:36:17.381
Can we get them out?

675
00:36:17.382 --> 00:36:18.416
We're going to do
our best.

676
00:36:18.417 --> 00:36:18.935
Here, Anna.
Put this on.

677
00:36:18.936 --> 00:36:21.005
This way, Anna.

678
00:36:22.525 --> 00:36:23.595
We've got leaks
in the gas main.

679
00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:28.288
When pockets of gas build up,
anything can set them off...

680
00:36:28.289 --> 00:36:30.566
A spark, static electricity,
even a cell phone.

681
00:36:30.567 --> 00:36:33.880
Is gas building up
in the cafe?

682
00:36:33.881 --> 00:36:35.985
I don't know.

683
00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:37.297
We're going to put
a sniffer down who can reach.

684
00:36:37.298 --> 00:36:38.816
There's a door
around the corner,

685
00:36:38.817 --> 00:36:40.680
at the end of the hall.

686
00:36:40.681 --> 00:36:42.785
It leads to the back stairs,
down to the cafe.

687
00:36:42.786 --> 00:36:45.512
If we can clear a path,
we should be able to reach them.

688
00:36:45.513 --> 00:36:48.206
Emily's down there, isn't she?

689
00:36:49.068 --> 00:36:51.104
We'll do everything we can.

690
00:36:51.105 --> 00:36:52.830
I give you my word.

691
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:54.141
Got a reading
off the sniffer yet?

692
00:36:54.142 --> 00:36:55.143
Down this way.

693
00:36:58.181 --> 00:37:00.113
Here's where
the stairs would be,

694
00:37:00.114 --> 00:37:00.839
but the upper floors collapsed.

695
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.909
My god.

696
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.773
Carl. Anna.

697
00:37:04.774 --> 00:37:05.671
Gas is seeping in.

698
00:37:09.468 --> 00:37:11.745
We're going to have to
dig them out.

699
00:37:11.746 --> 00:37:13.540
We can't risk it.
We can't.

700
00:37:13.541 --> 00:37:14.921
If we throw off one spark,
and the whole place blows.

701
00:37:14.922 --> 00:37:18.235
And you know

702
00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.374
what happens
to those people

703
00:37:19.375 --> 00:37:20.685
when the oxygen
gets displaced?

704
00:37:20.686 --> 00:37:21.515
At 20% gas,
they get dizzy.

705
00:37:21.516 --> 00:37:22.963
At 40%, they'll vomit.

706
00:37:22.964 --> 00:37:24.724
At 60%,
they are dead.

707
00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:26.277
Can we shut off the flow
to the neighborhood?

708
00:37:26.278 --> 00:37:28.659
All the shut-off valves
are underground.

709
00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.143
I wouldn't know
where to look.

710
00:37:30.144 --> 00:37:31.178
Who would?

711
00:37:31.179 --> 00:37:32.388
Public works.

712
00:37:34.493 --> 00:37:39.325
I don't understand.

713
00:37:39.326 --> 00:37:39.912
Why can't you do
the surgery here?

714
00:37:40.913 --> 00:37:42.120
Because
we're not surgeons.

715
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:43.501
This isn't a trauma center.

716
00:37:43.502 --> 00:37:44.675
You've been saying that
all afternoon.

717
00:37:44.676 --> 00:37:45.745
We don't have an O.R.
or an anesthesiologist.

718
00:37:45.746 --> 00:37:47.402
Then you bring
those people here.

719
00:37:47.403 --> 00:37:48.437
We can't.
The roads are closed.

720
00:37:48.438 --> 00:37:50.439
There is no access.

721
00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:50.958
Look, we are still hoping
for a helicopter.

722
00:37:51.614 --> 00:37:53.994
And where is it?

723
00:37:53.995 --> 00:37:55.789
Doug.

724
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:56.343
Anna's working on it
right now.

725
00:37:56.964 --> 00:37:58.172
Excuse me,

726
00:38:01.417 --> 00:38:02.210
I have
another patient.

727
00:38:14.222 --> 00:38:17.847
Jack.

728
00:38:18.813 --> 00:38:20.262
I'll be right there.

729
00:38:20.263 --> 00:38:25.302
Be honest with me.

730
00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:26.580
Without surgery,
she only has a couple of hours.

731
00:38:33.932 --> 00:38:38.625
So you're saying...

732
00:38:38.626 --> 00:38:42.042
That if I have
something to say to her,

733
00:38:42.043 --> 00:38:43.148
I need to say it now?

734
00:39:07.828 --> 00:39:11.969
Miriam.

735
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.764
Douglas.

736
00:39:13.765 --> 00:39:15.179
Can we help you, chief?

737
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.837
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

738
00:39:17.838 --> 00:39:19.253
Miriam is injured.
This is not a good time.

739
00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:22.531
We've got a big problem.
There's a gas leak in town.

740
00:39:22.532 --> 00:39:25.534
Well, I'm sure
the fire department

741
00:39:25.535 --> 00:39:26.087
can figure out
how to shut off a valve.

742
00:39:27.123 --> 00:39:28.469
It's a main valve
that's leaking.

743
00:39:28.918 --> 00:39:31.782
Douglas.

744
00:39:31.783 --> 00:39:32.818
I'm not on duty.

745
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:35.302
I'm afraid you're going
to have to be.

746
00:39:35.303 --> 00:39:36.857
People's lives are at stake.

747
00:39:47.454 --> 00:39:51.319
Would you step outside,
please, sheriff?

748
00:39:56.048 --> 00:40:00.535
I will not leave my wife.

749
00:40:00.536 --> 00:40:02.191
You don't have
a choice.

750
00:40:02.192 --> 00:40:03.917
Put him in the Van.

751
00:40:03.918 --> 00:40:04.953
Don't touch me!

752
00:40:04.954 --> 00:40:05.644
Don't take another step.

753
00:40:05.645 --> 00:40:07.231
Clint!

754
00:40:07.232 --> 00:40:07.922
Anna, let me
handle this.

755
00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:10.993
He's refusing
to safeguard the public

756
00:40:10.994 --> 00:40:12.719
in a crisis.

757
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.238
You activated
the security plan.

758
00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:14.998
You ought to know
its provisions.

759
00:40:14.999 --> 00:40:16.620
Stop.

760
00:40:16.621 --> 00:40:17.759
Clint, I want you to leave
the hospital.

761
00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.450
I want to talk
to Douglas alone.

762
00:40:18.451 --> 00:40:19.451
I will handle this.

763
00:40:35.122 --> 00:40:39.850
It doesn't
look good, Anna.

764
00:40:39.851 --> 00:40:40.679
If we don't get her
off this mountain...

765
00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.577
I know.

766
00:40:42.578 --> 00:40:43.992
I've got Marty and Jason
working on a medivac.

767
00:40:43.993 --> 00:40:46.857
Douglas, I am so sorry
about the timing of this,

768
00:40:46.858 --> 00:40:50.101
but I need you
to come to the cafe

769
00:40:50.102 --> 00:40:52.379
and turn off the gas.

770
00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.278
You can't ask me
to leave my wife

771
00:40:54.279 --> 00:40:55.382
to go help people
who wouldn't help me.

772
00:40:55.383 --> 00:40:55.901
I'm not asking you
to help them.

773
00:40:57.489 --> 00:40:58.870
There are other people
who are trapped down there,

774
00:41:00.147 --> 00:41:01.354
and they're running
out of time.

775
00:41:01.355 --> 00:41:02.838
Emily one of them?

776
00:41:02.839 --> 00:41:04.909
Douglas...

777
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:08.016
Hey, baby.

778
00:41:08.017 --> 00:41:10.363
I'm right here.

779
00:41:10.364 --> 00:41:13.021
I'm right here.

780
00:41:13.022 --> 00:41:14.057
Douglas, go.

781
00:41:18.303 --> 00:41:22.375
There are
six regulator stations

782
00:41:22.376 --> 00:41:24.688
for the town.

783
00:41:24.689 --> 00:41:25.827
The one that handles this area
is right here.

784
00:41:25.828 --> 00:41:27.829
It's Chestnut street.

785
00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.831
Now, to shut this sector off
from inside the station

786
00:41:29.832 --> 00:41:32.247
takes electricity.

787
00:41:32.248 --> 00:41:33.491
Can we bring in a generator?

788
00:41:34.699 --> 00:41:35.871
No. Not with
unmapped leaks in the line.

789
00:41:35.872 --> 00:41:36.873
It's just not safe.

790
00:41:38.426 --> 00:41:39.082
So I got to get down
to the manual shut-off valve

791
00:41:39.082 --> 00:41:39.980
down in the sewer.

792
00:41:40.774 --> 00:41:41.808
Once I cut the flow,

793
00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:44.259
we'll need to burn off

794
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:44.950
whatever gas
is left in the line,

795
00:41:44.951 --> 00:41:46.295
so any businesses

796
00:41:46.296 --> 00:41:47.365
that are supplied
at 2 p.S.I. And above,

797
00:41:47.366 --> 00:41:49.782
they should turn
their gas on full.

798
00:41:49.783 --> 00:41:51.680
That's the bakery,
the diner and the lodge.

799
00:41:51.681 --> 00:41:53.337
What if we get everyone
in the area to burn off gas?

800
00:41:53.338 --> 00:41:55.788
That's a good idea.

801
00:41:55.789 --> 00:41:56.961
We could get into that cafe
faster.

802
00:41:56.962 --> 00:41:58.032
Let's go.

803
00:42:02.347 --> 00:42:07.075
Carl, I'm in. Over.

804
00:42:07.076 --> 00:42:09.664
It's going up too fast, Carl.

805
00:42:09.665 --> 00:42:12.149
How much longer
can they be down there?

806
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.875
We've got about 10 minutes.

807
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:21.020
Carl, can you hear me?

808
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:22.469
Yeah. Douglas. Douglas.

809
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.816
Do you copy?

810
00:42:23.817 --> 00:42:24.989
Roger.

811
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:26.715
Carl, I'm at 60%.

812
00:42:26.716 --> 00:42:28.337
Roger that.
I got you, I got you.

813
00:42:28.338 --> 00:42:30.270
I'm at 70%
now, Carl.

814
00:42:30.271 --> 00:42:32.272
It's climbing fast.

815
00:42:32.273 --> 00:42:33.171
75. Still going up.

816
00:42:36.139 --> 00:42:37.208
Why is he moving so slowly?

817
00:42:37.209 --> 00:42:39.970
He's got to, Anna.

818
00:42:39.971 --> 00:42:40.971
If he creates one spark,
he blows up the whole place.

819
00:42:40.972 --> 00:42:42.800
We broke 85.

820
00:42:42.801 --> 00:42:44.940
Douglas,
what's your 20?

821
00:42:44.941 --> 00:42:45.424
I can see it.
I can see the valve, Carl.

822
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.567
Doug,
you all right?

823
00:42:53.018 --> 00:42:53.881
I'm fine. I'm fine.

824
00:43:01.337 --> 00:43:04.892
The valve is off.

825
00:43:06.273 --> 00:43:07.342
Repeat,
the valve is off.

826
00:43:07.343 --> 00:43:09.309
Tell your men
to move, Carl.

827
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.346
Okay. The main is off.

828
00:43:11.347 --> 00:43:11.796
Go ahead and burn out
the system.

829
00:43:19.148 --> 00:43:22.772
Carl!

830
00:43:24.222 --> 00:43:25.257
Is it dropping?

831
00:43:28.675 --> 00:43:29.641
Take a look.

832
00:43:29.642 --> 00:43:30.883
It's falling.

833
00:43:30.884 --> 00:43:31.643
Men, let's get ready to go.

834
00:43:31.644 --> 00:43:32.644
It's at 10.

835
00:43:35.509 --> 00:43:36.372
Okay, men, let's move it!

836
00:43:58.981 --> 00:44:03.812
Any word on Emily?

837
00:44:03.813 --> 00:44:04.917
No. And your father
hasn't come up either.

838
00:44:04.918 --> 00:44:07.678
It'll be okay.

839
00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:08.679
They're both going
to be okay.

840
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.165
Dad!

841
00:44:12.166 --> 00:44:13.615
I got him,
I got him.

842
00:44:13.616 --> 00:44:14.893
He's going
to be okay.

843
00:44:15.825 --> 00:44:17.239
He'll be all right.

844
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.379
Come on, dad.
Sit down here.

845
00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.659
Here you go.

846
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.661
I'll come
to the hospital.

847
00:44:27.009 --> 00:44:28.148
Douglas.

848
00:44:31.841 --> 00:44:34.084
You did the right thing
coming down here today.

849
00:44:34.085 --> 00:44:36.500
Now it's our turn.

850
00:44:36.501 --> 00:44:38.467
Here's your contract.

851
00:44:38.468 --> 00:44:39.745
We all signed it,
every last one of US.

852
00:44:39.746 --> 00:44:40.816
We all want to say
we're sorry.

853
00:44:41.886 --> 00:44:42.680
I personally want to say thanks.

854
00:44:43.853 --> 00:44:44.958
Anna.

855
00:44:48.375 --> 00:44:49.272
Are you looking
for Emily?

856
00:44:49.963 --> 00:44:52.585
Yes. Where is she?

857
00:44:52.586 --> 00:44:53.518
She asked
for the afternoon off.

858
00:44:53.519 --> 00:44:54.932
It was slow, so I let her go.

859
00:44:54.933 --> 00:44:56.623
Go? Go where?

860
00:44:56.624 --> 00:44:57.418
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

861
00:45:12.157 --> 00:45:16.402
I can't move it.

862
00:45:16.403 --> 00:45:18.231
Use your legs.

863
00:45:18.232 --> 00:45:20.889
Come on

864
00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:22.684
if a meteorite can
knock down a tree,

865
00:45:22.685 --> 00:45:23.272
you should be able
to push it with your legs.

866
00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:33.453
It won't budge.

867
00:45:33.454 --> 00:45:36.077
Emily,
in my trunk,

868
00:45:36.078 --> 00:45:37.803
there's a crowbar.

869
00:45:37.804 --> 00:45:39.149
Go grab it.

870
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:40.944
Okay.

871
00:45:40.945 --> 00:45:41.773
Wait, wait, wait...

872
00:45:44.362 --> 00:45:45.294
Keys, keys, keys.

873
00:46:01.828 --> 00:46:06.314
I got it!

874
00:46:06.315 --> 00:46:07.005
Use it as a wedge right there.

875
00:46:08.973 --> 00:46:12.113
Pry it in...

876
00:46:12.114 --> 00:46:13.252
Ready...

877
00:46:13.253 --> 00:46:14.287
One, two...

878
00:46:14.288 --> 00:46:15.565
Three!

879
00:46:20.225 --> 00:46:24.781
I don't think
it's going to move.

880
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:25.230
Try it again.
Try it again!

881
00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:26.853
Hang on.

882
00:46:38.899 --> 00:46:43.316
Hang on, I got an idea.

883
00:46:43.317 --> 00:46:44.663
Where are you going?

884
00:46:54.018 --> 00:46:58.711
Okay, okay...

885
00:46:58.712 --> 00:47:00.402
Okay,
I'm going to tie the rope...

886
00:47:00.403 --> 00:47:02.197
Are you okay?

887
00:47:02.198 --> 00:47:04.856
Yeah, I'm okay.

888
00:47:06.099 --> 00:47:06.685
I'll tie it
around the tree...

889
00:47:08.687 --> 00:47:10.757
I'm going to loop around
that branch right there,

890
00:47:10.758 --> 00:47:12.173
and then I'm going to tie
the other end to your car.

891
00:47:12.174 --> 00:47:14.796
I'll back it up,

892
00:47:14.797 --> 00:47:16.004
and you'll be able
to slide out.

893
00:47:16.005 --> 00:47:16.488
How are you going to back up?

894
00:47:16.489 --> 00:47:18.593
What do you mean?

895
00:47:18.594 --> 00:47:19.491
Release the brake
and put it in reverse.

896
00:47:19.492 --> 00:47:21.286
You can't drive, Emily.

897
00:47:22.011 --> 00:47:22.978
How hard can it be?

898
00:47:22.979 --> 00:47:24.185
My car's a stick.

899
00:47:27.914 --> 00:47:31.572
I understand that
we're in a disaster here,

900
00:47:32.953 --> 00:47:34.885
but your nurses can't even get
a proper set of vitals.

901
00:47:34.886 --> 00:47:37.405
How am I supposed to do my job
if they can't do theirs?

902
00:47:37.406 --> 00:47:39.269
We're all under a lot
of stress here, doctor.

903
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:41.064
You know what...

904
00:47:41.065 --> 00:47:42.375
Just have all the vitals
rechecked.

905
00:47:42.376 --> 00:47:42.860
And make sure
they're done right.

906
00:47:54.009 --> 00:47:58.288
This town's just a pit stop
for you, isn't it, Dr. Ryan?

907
00:47:58.289 --> 00:48:00.567
Excuse me?

908
00:48:01.292 --> 00:48:03.086
In for a few years,

909
00:48:03.087 --> 00:48:03.742
spend some time
on the slopes,

910
00:48:03.743 --> 00:48:05.226
then out you go?

911
00:48:05.227 --> 00:48:05.883
But for the rest of US,
this is home.

912
00:48:06.745 --> 00:48:08.815
We were born here,

913
00:48:08.816 --> 00:48:10.472
we raised
our families here.

914
00:48:10.473 --> 00:48:12.405
Sometimes,
we Bury our children here.

915
00:48:12.406 --> 00:48:14.131
So when we come to work
at this hospital,

916
00:48:14.132 --> 00:48:15.892
it's with mutual respect.

917
00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.549
Natalie Darwin
has 32 years' experience

918
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:21.311
in emergency medicine.

919
00:48:21.312 --> 00:48:22.864
Sandy's been an aide for 17.

920
00:48:22.865 --> 00:48:25.039
Dina and Kevin
had over 40 years between them

921
00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.111
before they retired.

922
00:48:28.112 --> 00:48:30.596
And Laura...

923
00:48:30.597 --> 00:48:32.770
Laura hasn't missed a single day
in 37 years.

924
00:48:32.771 --> 00:48:36.119
That's over a hundred years
experience, doctor.

925
00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.501
I've found that to be
a good number in a crisis.

926
00:48:50.686 --> 00:48:54.792
You got it?

927
00:48:54.793 --> 00:48:57.105
Yeah.

928
00:48:57.106 --> 00:48:58.107
Yeah, I got it.

929
00:49:09.118 --> 00:49:12.362
That's not reverse.

930
00:49:12.363 --> 00:49:14.157
Yeah. No kidding.

931
00:49:14.158 --> 00:49:16.538
Put the clutch
to the floor

932
00:49:16.539 --> 00:49:17.092
and shove the stick
all the way to the right.

933
00:49:17.093 --> 00:49:19.576
Right. Clutch in.

934
00:49:19.577 --> 00:49:22.820
Now ease on the gas
as you ease off the clutch.

935
00:49:22.821 --> 00:49:26.583
Ease on the gas.

936
00:49:26.584 --> 00:49:27.756
Ease off the clutch.

937
00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:29.620
Come on.

938
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:30.967
Got it?
Keep it going!

939
00:49:34.488 --> 00:49:35.351
Seth, are you okay?

940
00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:37.871
The key word was "ease."

941
00:49:39.355 --> 00:49:40.908
Just try again.

942
00:49:45.085 --> 00:49:49.778
Okay.

943
00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:52.747
Ease on the gas,
ease on the clutch.

944
00:49:52.748 --> 00:49:54.369
That's it.
Keep it going.

945
00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.302
That's it!
Keep it going!

946
00:49:55.923 --> 00:49:57.373
Keep it going!

947
00:50:00.169 --> 00:50:04.483
You piece of crap!

948
00:50:04.484 --> 00:50:06.450
Well, that's useful.

949
00:50:06.451 --> 00:50:08.004
Insult my car.

950
00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:09.764
Seth, tell me you're okay!

951
00:50:09.765 --> 00:50:11.353
I'm okay.

952
00:50:16.668 --> 00:50:21.155
Seth, I think I figured out
what the problem is.

953
00:50:21.156 --> 00:50:24.227
The tires are slipping

954
00:50:24.228 --> 00:50:25.331
because there's
too much snow here.

955
00:50:25.332 --> 00:50:27.921
Use the crowbar
to chip away at the ice.

956
00:50:28.991 --> 00:50:31.130
You know, Seth, coming up here

957
00:50:31.131 --> 00:50:33.132
to be alone with you
at your grandpa's trailer...

958
00:50:33.133 --> 00:50:34.272
This is not how I thought
this day was going to go!

959
00:50:36.378 --> 00:50:37.827
Actually, em,

960
00:50:40.485 --> 00:50:41.176
it wasn't going to go
how you thought anyway.

961
00:50:41.177 --> 00:50:43.142
What?

962
00:50:43.143 --> 00:50:43.695
I wasn't
going to go through with it.

963
00:50:46.767 --> 00:50:49.286
I wasn't going
to sleep with you.

964
00:50:49.287 --> 00:50:50.563
Why not?

965
00:50:50.564 --> 00:50:54.153
Because you said yes

966
00:50:54.154 --> 00:50:55.465
for all
the wrong reasons.

967
00:50:55.466 --> 00:50:57.950
Why was today
going to be the day?

968
00:50:57.951 --> 00:51:00.332
Because you found out
you were going to move?

969
00:51:00.333 --> 00:51:02.196
You had a fight
with your mom?

970
00:51:02.197 --> 00:51:02.990
When we sleep together...

971
00:51:03.957 --> 00:51:07.547
I want it to be about US.

972
00:51:13.622 --> 00:51:16.314
Jack, what is it?

973
00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:18.246
What's going on?

974
00:51:18.247 --> 00:51:19.247
Jack!

975
00:51:19.248 --> 00:51:20.284
Let me go!

976
00:51:22.424 --> 00:51:23.527
Tyler's going to be okay.

977
00:51:23.528 --> 00:51:25.598
What is he doing?

978
00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:28.670
I need an 18-Gauge needle
right now

979
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:29.810
and set me up for a chest tube.

980
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.990
He's got a tension pneumo.

981
00:51:37.991 --> 00:51:38.992
If we don't get the air out now,
we're going to lose him.

982
00:52:24.555 --> 00:52:29.662
He's stable, Janet.

983
00:52:29.663 --> 00:52:30.457
His lung collapsed,
but we got it reinflated.

984
00:52:34.289 --> 00:52:36.911
I've upped him
2 milligrams morphine,

985
00:52:36.912 --> 00:52:39.120
so he's comfortable.

986
00:52:39.121 --> 00:52:41.261
He's going to pull
through this, Jack, isn't he?

987
00:52:42.262 --> 00:52:46.886
He inhaled
a lot of smoke.

988
00:52:46.887 --> 00:52:48.371
Until he's breathing
on his own again

989
00:52:48.372 --> 00:52:50.925
and his oxygen levels come up,

990
00:52:50.926 --> 00:52:52.685
I can't be sure.

991
00:52:52.686 --> 00:52:54.100
He needs some time
on the ventilator.

992
00:52:54.101 --> 00:52:55.757
He had his heart so set
on that camping trip.

993
00:52:55.758 --> 00:52:59.692
Every day,
he would pull out the book

994
00:52:59.693 --> 00:53:01.315
with the trees and the birds,

995
00:53:01.316 --> 00:53:03.903
a map to the sky,

996
00:53:03.904 --> 00:53:05.698
you know that one
with the little wheel?

997
00:53:05.699 --> 00:53:07.356
He got that from Ricky,
a love of the sky.

998
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:16.088
God, I'm sorry.

999
00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:17.124
I'm sorry, Jack.

1000
00:53:20.335 --> 00:53:21.059
I wanted to be strong, I did.

1001
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:27.411
I can't lose him, Jack,
I just can't.

1002
00:53:33.037 --> 00:53:37.385
How do you survive
the loss of a child?

1003
00:53:37.386 --> 00:53:40.595
I don't know.

1004
00:53:40.596 --> 00:53:42.322
I don't know if you ever do.

1005
00:53:42.874 --> 00:53:46.222
I haven't.

1006
00:53:46.223 --> 00:53:47.914
I think
a part of you never does.

1007
00:53:49.571 --> 00:53:50.710
The rest of you just keeps
limping along day after day.

1008
00:53:52.436 --> 00:53:54.507
When Ricky died,

1009
00:53:57.337 --> 00:53:58.337
I didn't know
what to do or say

1010
00:53:58.338 --> 00:53:59.683
to help you and Anna.

1011
00:53:59.684 --> 00:54:01.651
Really?

1012
00:54:01.652 --> 00:54:04.654
You were the first one
to come over

1013
00:54:04.655 --> 00:54:06.587
and the last one
to leave every night.

1014
00:54:06.588 --> 00:54:08.347
You answered the phone for US
when we couldn't.

1015
00:54:08.348 --> 00:54:12.075
When people started flooding in,

1016
00:54:12.076 --> 00:54:13.076
you made sure there was coffee
on the stove.

1017
00:54:13.077 --> 00:54:14.320
Emily was never alone.

1018
00:54:15.182 --> 00:54:17.080
You brought US meals every day.

1019
00:54:17.081 --> 00:54:18.324
My casseroles!

1020
00:54:19.048 --> 00:54:21.912
God, they're awful.

1021
00:54:21.913 --> 00:54:24.951
Well...

1022
00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:27.849
No, it's true.
They are.

1023
00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:29.644
Tyler hates them.

1024
00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:30.301
Hey, we ate 'em
and we were grateful.

1025
00:54:32.579 --> 00:54:34.547
Jack...

1026
00:54:36.963 --> 00:54:41.069
Please just tell me

1027
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:41.795
when this nightmare's
going to be over.

1028
00:54:41.796 --> 00:54:43.314
I can't.

1029
00:54:44.211 --> 00:54:47.455
You have to be hopeful, Janet.

1030
00:54:47.456 --> 00:54:49.319
Tyler needs you to be hopeful.

1031
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.804
That's your job, okay?

1032
00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:53.945
Okay.

1033
00:55:00.883 --> 00:55:05.162
This is
mayor Anna Davenport,

1034
00:55:05.163 --> 00:55:07.510
talking to you

1035
00:55:07.511 --> 00:55:08.270
from our emergency
broadcast station,

1036
00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:10.064
kcxn 1610 radio.

1037
00:55:10.065 --> 00:55:14.689
At 4:15 this afternoon,

1038
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:16.485
our town was hit
by a shower of small meteorites.

1039
00:55:18.384 --> 00:55:23.595
Less than an hour later,
more rocks fell.

1040
00:55:23.596 --> 00:55:26.460
The damage has been severe
but localized.

1041
00:55:26.461 --> 00:55:30.360
Both the power plant
has been hit,

1042
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:31.672
knocking out most of the
electricity in the county.

1043
00:55:31.673 --> 00:55:34.744
We've got a broken water
main

1044
00:55:34.745 --> 00:55:36.988
and are being advised

1045
00:55:38.369 --> 00:55:39.921
to boil water
before drinking it,

1046
00:55:39.922 --> 00:55:41.440
or just drink bottled water
until further notice.

1047
00:55:41.441 --> 00:55:42.615
There have been some
casualties and many
injuries.

1048
00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:49.068
Dr. Ryan and Dr. Baxter
are at the hospital,

1049
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:51.277
treating patients,

1050
00:55:51.278 --> 00:55:52.900
but they need blood...

1051
00:55:52.901 --> 00:55:55.109
Every type and a lot of
it.

1052
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:55.938
So if you can,
please come in and give.

1053
00:55:57.595 --> 00:56:02.012
For those of you who cannot
stay in your homes,

1054
00:56:02.013 --> 00:56:03.601
or don't want to be
alone,

1055
00:56:04.844 --> 00:56:06.741
we're setting up
a temporary shelter

1056
00:56:06.742 --> 00:56:08.812
at the cottonwood
community church.

1057
00:56:08.813 --> 00:56:10.711
Millie wildflower will be
coordinating efforts there.

1058
00:56:10.712 --> 00:56:14.508
For those of you
who are afraid

1059
00:56:14.509 --> 00:56:17.649
that more rocks may fall

1060
00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:18.340
and are thinking about
getting out of town,

1061
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.894
well, that's
no longer possible.

1062
00:56:21.895 --> 00:56:23.551
One of the impacts took out a
piece of highway 40

1063
00:56:23.552 --> 00:56:26.348
about six miles
down the mountain.

1064
00:56:27.522 --> 00:56:29.662
Even if you could
get off the mountain,

1065
00:56:31.629 --> 00:56:33.975
it wouldn't keep you safe.

1066
00:56:33.976 --> 00:56:36.599
There have been reports

1067
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.428
of rocks falling
all over Colorado,

1068
00:56:37.429 --> 00:56:40.775
with an alert

1069
00:56:40.776 --> 00:56:41.845
for continued activity
in the sky.

1070
00:56:41.846 --> 00:56:44.503
So what are we left to
do?

1071
00:56:44.504 --> 00:56:46.436
Where do we turn
when we cannot run?

1072
00:56:46.437 --> 00:56:49.405
I hope to each other.

1073
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:51.234
Don't wait to hear from
me.

1074
00:56:51.235 --> 00:56:53.201
Look in on your neighbor.

1075
00:56:53.202 --> 00:56:54.582
Share whatever food and water
you have.

1076
00:56:54.583 --> 00:56:58.172
It comes from the Bible:

1077
00:56:58.173 --> 00:57:02.038
"Two are better than one,

1078
00:57:02.039 --> 00:57:04.765
"for if they fall,
one will lift the other up.

1079
00:57:04.766 --> 00:57:07.941
And a three-fold rope
is not easily broken."

1080
00:57:08.908 --> 00:57:11.911
We are a town of 1900.

1081
00:57:12.981 --> 00:57:14.948
We are not easily broken either.

1082
00:57:21.368 --> 00:57:24.993
Seth?

1083
00:57:25.683 --> 00:57:26.788
Seth?

1084
00:57:28.824 --> 00:57:29.756
There is one last thing
I'd like to say.

1085
00:57:29.757 --> 00:57:31.586
Seth?

1086
00:57:33.104 --> 00:57:34.829
I'm the mayor of cottonwood,
but I'm also a mother.

1087
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:35.935
Emily, wherever you are,
please, keep yourself safe.

1088
00:57:40.318 --> 00:57:45.081
Please, sweetie, be safe.

1089
00:57:45.082 --> 00:57:47.393
My daughter, Emily,
is missing.

1090
00:57:47.394 --> 00:57:49.362
If anyone knows where she
is,

1091
00:57:50.812 --> 00:57:53.986
please come to the hospital
and let US know.

1092
00:57:53.987 --> 00:57:57.369
And, em, if you can hear me,
I love you.

1093
00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:01.338
And I will find you.

1094
00:58:01.339 --> 00:58:05.273
All the way to the right...

1095
00:58:05.274 --> 00:58:07.483
Ease off the clutch.

1096
00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:08.381
Keep it going.

1097
00:58:08.382 --> 00:58:11.141
That's it.

1098
00:58:11.142 --> 00:58:12.454
Okay, that's it.

1099
00:58:17.873 --> 00:58:22.014
I'm out!

1100
00:58:22.015 --> 00:58:23.153
Emily!

1101
00:58:23.154 --> 00:58:24.501
Emily! Emily!

1102
00:58:26.951 --> 00:58:28.988
Emily!

1103
00:58:31.024 --> 00:58:33.129
Seth!

1104
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:34.372
Em...

1105
00:58:37.548 --> 00:58:38.238
Seth, I did it.
I got you out!

1106
00:58:38.239 --> 00:58:39.860
God.

1107
00:58:39.861 --> 00:58:41.482
No!

1108
00:58:41.483 --> 00:58:42.311
My god,
I'm so sorry.

1109
00:58:51.631 --> 00:58:55.738
Better?

1110
00:58:55.739 --> 00:58:56.878
Yes.

1111
00:59:20.108 --> 00:59:23.698
How's his blood gas?

1112
00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:26.804
His c-o-2 is 49
and his p-h is 7-3-2.

1113
00:59:31.637 --> 00:59:32.810
Natalie, can you resecure
his e.T. Tube?

1114
00:59:35.917 --> 00:59:38.608
Yes, doctor.

1115
00:59:38.609 --> 00:59:39.506
I'm thinking of upping
his vent rate.

1116
00:59:42.509 --> 00:59:45.028
Yeah. I wouldn't
recommend that.

1117
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:47.618
Why not?

1118
00:59:48.826 --> 00:59:51.414
Well, he's already had
a tension pneumo.

1119
00:59:51.415 --> 00:59:54.797
A slightly low o-2 level
won't kill him,

1120
00:59:54.798 --> 00:59:55.384
but if we blow out
his other lung...

1121
00:59:56.523 --> 00:59:59.009
I'd leave his
airway pressure down.

1122
01:00:00.182 --> 01:00:01.494
When I was at sc,

1123
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.084
I was working on a study
on permissive hypocapnia

1124
01:00:06.085 --> 01:00:07.637
in kids with chest trauma.

1125
01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:08.845
There were many fewer
lung complications.

1126
01:00:08.846 --> 01:00:11.608
Why haven't I
seen this study?

1127
01:00:12.919 --> 01:00:13.679
It's still underway,
hasn't been published yet.

1128
01:00:14.887 --> 01:00:17.614
Look, I know
it goes against your gut.

1129
01:00:19.098 --> 01:00:20.650
It went against mine, too,
until I saw the early results.

1130
01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:23.998
But it's what Tyler needs.

1131
01:00:23.999 --> 01:00:24.897
How long have you been
out of residency, doctor?

1132
01:00:27.554 --> 01:00:29.971
Three years. Why?

1133
01:00:31.489 --> 01:00:32.318
You know when I said
a hundred years experience

1134
01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:35.977
can be a helpful number?

1135
01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.980
Three can be helpful, too.

1136
01:00:39.739 --> 01:00:41.948
Let's do it.

1137
01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:49.265
Thank you for coming.

1138
01:00:49.266 --> 01:00:50.508
What are you
doing here?

1139
01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.305
You asked the citizens
of this town to give blood.

1140
01:00:55.306 --> 01:00:56.376
I'm here to give blood.

1141
01:00:56.929 --> 01:00:59.620
I'm sorry.

1142
01:00:59.621 --> 01:01:00.656
I shouldn't have had
my back up.

1143
01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:01.623
Around me,
you always seem to.

1144
01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:04.176
Franny?

1145
01:01:04.177 --> 01:01:06.662
Are you okay?

1146
01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.422
I'm fine, Mrs. Baxter.

1147
01:01:08.423 --> 01:01:10.148
Do you know
where Emily is?

1148
01:01:10.149 --> 01:01:13.530
She left work early.

1149
01:01:13.531 --> 01:01:14.671
Why? Where
was she going?

1150
01:01:15.223 --> 01:01:16.499
She didn't say.

1151
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.260
She didn't say.

1152
01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:19.917
They didn't say.

1153
01:01:23.265 --> 01:01:25.267
She was with Seth.

1154
01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:30.963
You scan. I'll drive.

1155
01:01:31.653 --> 01:01:32.998
What?

1156
01:01:32.999 --> 01:01:35.104
I put a tracking device
on Seth's car.

1157
01:01:35.105 --> 01:01:36.382
Makes it easy to keep tabs
on a teenage boy.

1158
01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:39.971
Isn't that
invasion of privacy?

1159
01:01:39.972 --> 01:01:41.420
You want to question me
about the way I raise my kid,

1160
01:01:41.421 --> 01:01:43.043
or you want to find yours?

1161
01:01:43.044 --> 01:01:43.872
What button do I push?

1162
01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:54.641
I'm getting a reading.

1163
01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:56.608
Show me.

1164
01:01:56.609 --> 01:01:58.575
They're at
my dad's trailer.

1165
01:01:58.576 --> 01:02:00.440
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

1166
01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.961
Are these things expensive?

1167
01:02:16.594 --> 01:02:20.839
I need you
to start the car.

1168
01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.015
Okay.

1169
01:02:24.568 --> 01:02:25.465
Now, I need you to shift
while I call out the gears.

1170
01:02:25.466 --> 01:02:28.536
You ready?

1171
01:02:28.537 --> 01:02:30.262
Put her into first.
That's third.

1172
01:02:30.263 --> 01:02:31.126
Back to the left and up.
Good.

1173
01:02:31.127 --> 01:02:33.610
Now to second.

1174
01:02:33.611 --> 01:02:34.198
All right,
here we go. First.

1175
01:02:37.305 --> 01:02:40.998
Second.

1176
01:02:41.688 --> 01:02:43.620
Third!

1177
01:02:43.621 --> 01:02:44.622
Okay, second.
Back to second.

1178
01:02:49.386 --> 01:02:53.976
Why wouldn't they
have called?

1179
01:02:53.977 --> 01:02:55.736
A cell doesn't get
reception up here.

1180
01:02:55.737 --> 01:02:58.946
They'd need to have
a radio.

1181
01:02:58.947 --> 01:03:00.154
They must have know
that something's happening.

1182
01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:01.777
They would have tried
to get back to town.

1183
01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.675
Maybe they thought
it was safer up here.

1184
01:03:03.676 --> 01:03:06.091
Maybe they tried to get back
and they couldn't.

1185
01:03:06.092 --> 01:03:07.748
They've had an accident.

1186
01:03:07.749 --> 01:03:09.508
Or they've been
struck by rocks.

1187
01:03:09.509 --> 01:03:10.786
Would you keep
those thoughts to yourself?

1188
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.822
Why is it our kids
can't stand to be apart,

1189
01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:16.964
and we can't stand
to be together?

1190
01:03:16.965 --> 01:03:20.381
We've never even had
a civil conversation.

1191
01:03:20.382 --> 01:03:22.970
What do you want to talk about?

1192
01:03:22.971 --> 01:03:25.421
Well, did Seth say anything
this morning?

1193
01:03:25.422 --> 01:03:29.356
We had some words.

1194
01:03:29.357 --> 01:03:30.496
Not about Emily.
About his mother.

1195
01:03:36.502 --> 01:03:41.644
I didn't know Molly very well.

1196
01:03:41.645 --> 01:03:43.026
We were always friendly
when we saw each other in town.

1197
01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:47.719
I know.

1198
01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.998
I never really understood
why she left.

1199
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:52.620
I know that, too.

1200
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:56.072
She said
she didn't want

1201
01:03:56.073 --> 01:03:58.386
to live in a small town
the rest of her life.

1202
01:03:59.145 --> 01:04:00.974
Called it provincial.

1203
01:04:00.975 --> 01:04:04.805
Hopeless.

1204
01:04:04.806 --> 01:04:06.600
She didn't think about her son
who had his friends here.

1205
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:10.535
Or the husband with a job here.

1206
01:04:10.536 --> 01:04:12.295
I don't begrudge her
her ambition.

1207
01:04:12.296 --> 01:04:15.643
I just wish she'd...

1208
01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:16.922
Told me before we had Seth.

1209
01:04:20.235 --> 01:04:23.824
So did Emily say
anything to you?

1210
01:04:23.825 --> 01:04:26.206
Nothing.

1211
01:04:26.207 --> 01:04:29.002
She wouldn't even speak to me.

1212
01:04:29.003 --> 01:04:31.797
She's so angry
because I want to move, too.

1213
01:04:31.798 --> 01:04:35.388
Sometimes I wonder what kind
of mother I've been to her.

1214
01:04:36.562 --> 01:04:39.322
We may not agree
on much of anything, Anna,

1215
01:04:39.323 --> 01:04:43.223
but my son should've been
so lucky

1216
01:04:43.224 --> 01:04:43.914
as to have a mother like you.

1217
01:04:49.506 --> 01:04:51.024
It's making a sound.

1218
01:04:51.025 --> 01:04:53.681
It's okay.
He's coming down the mountain.

1219
01:04:53.682 --> 01:04:55.925
We're on the same road
as they are.

1220
01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:57.031
Third.

1221
01:04:59.378 --> 01:05:02.968
Seth, look out!

1222
01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:04.797
Something wrong.

1223
01:05:06.972 --> 01:05:08.421
I've lost the signal.

1224
01:05:12.805 --> 01:05:16.395
Seth?

1225
01:05:16.878 --> 01:05:17.982
Emily?

1226
01:05:17.983 --> 01:05:19.018
Seth!
Emily!

1227
01:05:19.743 --> 01:05:20.881
Seth!

1228
01:05:20.882 --> 01:05:21.987
Seth!

1229
01:05:24.955 --> 01:05:26.750
Emily...

1230
01:05:29.615 --> 01:05:30.581
Easy now.
It'll be okay.

1231
01:05:30.582 --> 01:05:34.033
I got you. I got you.

1232
01:05:35.138 --> 01:05:35.862
Come on, come on,
come on.

1233
01:05:38.555 --> 01:05:39.211
It's okay.
I've got you.

1234
01:05:45.493 --> 01:05:50.083
He sounds sounds clear.

1235
01:05:50.084 --> 01:05:51.671
He's at full saturation.

1236
01:05:52.431 --> 01:05:53.777
Jack. Emily's hurt.

1237
01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.437
She's going
to need you

1238
01:05:59.438 --> 01:06:00.370
to be her dad,
not her doctor.

1239
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:02.785
Emily. Baby.

1240
01:06:02.786 --> 01:06:03.994
She been in
an accident.

1241
01:06:05.099 --> 01:06:06.133
It's going to be
all right.

1242
01:06:06.134 --> 01:06:07.238
Dr. Ryan here's going
to stitch you up.

1243
01:06:07.239 --> 01:06:09.447
Doctor.

1244
01:06:09.448 --> 01:06:11.138
Why not you?

1245
01:06:11.139 --> 01:06:12.484
'Cause if screwed up.
You'd never forgive me.

1246
01:06:12.485 --> 01:06:14.521
You'll be all right,
sweetie.

1247
01:06:14.522 --> 01:06:16.005
It'll be okay.
Go with her.

1248
01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:18.559
Seth.

1249
01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.113
Can you walk?
Okay. Come on.

1250
01:06:20.114 --> 01:06:21.460
Let's get you cleaned up.

1251
01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:23.186
Is it just your head?

1252
01:06:27.121 --> 01:06:29.294
I'll hold it steady.
Hop right up there.

1253
01:06:29.295 --> 01:06:31.572
Good girl! Okay.

1254
01:06:31.573 --> 01:06:32.022
You're going to be
fine, sweetheart.

1255
01:06:36.199 --> 01:06:40.512
How's Tyler?

1256
01:06:40.513 --> 01:06:42.376
He's okay for now.

1257
01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:43.447
Let's sit down.

1258
01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:58.393
Did you write that letter?

1259
01:06:58.945 --> 01:07:02.810
Excuse me?

1260
01:07:02.811 --> 01:07:05.227
I asked you to write a letter
to your mother.

1261
01:07:05.228 --> 01:07:06.849
Your only son is nearly killed,

1262
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:08.920
and all you can think about
is did I write that letter?

1263
01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:10.026
So did you?

1264
01:07:13.132 --> 01:07:14.236
Yeah, I wrote her a letter.

1265
01:07:14.237 --> 01:07:17.688
Did you mail it?

1266
01:07:18.965 --> 01:07:19.621
No. Thought you might like
to read it first.

1267
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:26.558
That's none of my business.

1268
01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:28.940
Dad, I want you to know
how I feel about her.

1269
01:07:28.941 --> 01:07:31.184
I want you to know
what it says.

1270
01:07:31.185 --> 01:07:33.979
Why?

1271
01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.499
Because we should know that
about each other, shouldn't we?

1272
01:07:37.122 --> 01:07:37.915
Do you still
love her?

1273
01:07:41.781 --> 01:07:45.406
Yes, I do.

1274
01:07:46.131 --> 01:07:47.269
Would you take her back?

1275
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.754
No, I wouldn't.

1276
01:07:50.756 --> 01:07:51.895
Do you love her?

1277
01:07:55.174 --> 01:07:57.486
She hasn't earned that.

1278
01:07:57.487 --> 01:07:58.902
Would you give her a chance to?

1279
01:08:03.907 --> 01:08:08.117
Yeah, I would.

1280
01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:09.119
Well, good.

1281
01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:15.228
We both know
how we feel about your mom now.

1282
01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:16.851
Put a stamp on that envelope,
seal it shut and mail it.

1283
01:08:18.024 --> 01:08:20.441
Yes, sir.

1284
01:08:22.512 --> 01:08:23.202
I'll get you another ice pack.

1285
01:08:33.557 --> 01:08:34.282
Doctor, we've got a problem.

1286
01:08:37.975 --> 01:08:39.045
Bed 4's coding.

1287
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:42.669
We need the crash cart
and a defibrilator now.

1288
01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:45.499
Find Doug.
Keep him in the waiting room.

1289
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.743
I'm seeing cardiac arrest.

1290
01:08:48.572 --> 01:08:51.091
I got nothing.

1291
01:08:51.092 --> 01:08:53.093
Start cpr.

1292
01:08:53.094 --> 01:08:54.301
Anna, it's tad.
Can you hear me?

1293
01:08:54.302 --> 01:08:57.581
Anna?

1294
01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:00.101
Mom.

1295
01:09:03.277 --> 01:09:04.140
She not responding.

1296
01:09:15.634 --> 01:09:20.810
Anna, I want you
to listen to me.

1297
01:09:20.811 --> 01:09:23.399
The rocks that have been falling
over the last few hours,

1298
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.849
we now know that they're debris
from a single larger meteor

1299
01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:27.334
heading our way.

1300
01:09:27.335 --> 01:09:29.267
Your way or mine?

1301
01:09:29.268 --> 01:09:30.613
The computer models put impact
in eastern routt county,

1302
01:09:30.614 --> 01:09:35.135
just north of highway 40.

1303
01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:36.378
In other words, mine.

1304
01:09:36.379 --> 01:09:38.380
What's going to happen?

1305
01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:40.036
As it hits the atmosphere,

1306
01:09:40.037 --> 01:09:42.418
you're going to hear
a tremendous Sonic boom,

1307
01:09:42.419 --> 01:09:44.076
louder than any you've heard
so far.

1308
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.492
The sky above you
will turn blindingly bright.

1309
01:09:46.493 --> 01:09:49.081
And then?

1310
01:09:50.324 --> 01:09:52.808
Listen,
I'm not gonna kid you, Anna,

1311
01:09:52.809 --> 01:09:54.430
if it hits, it's like
an atomic bomb going off,

1312
01:09:54.431 --> 01:09:56.433
total devastation
at impact site,

1313
01:09:57.710 --> 01:09:59.366
with significant damage
up to 500 miles away.

1314
01:09:59.367 --> 01:10:01.024
What do you mean "if it hits?"

1315
01:10:02.336 --> 01:10:04.509
It's theoretically
possible

1316
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:05.648
that a big rock like this
could blow apart

1317
01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:07.754
from all the friction it causes

1318
01:10:07.755 --> 01:10:09.825
as it goes through
the atmosphere...

1319
01:10:09.826 --> 01:10:10.929
If the composition
is just right.

1320
01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.069
Has that ever happened?

1321
01:10:13.381 --> 01:10:14.417
Once, or at least
we think so.

1322
01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:16.763
In 1908, a big meteorite
about this size

1323
01:10:16.764 --> 01:10:21.112
was coming in over Siberia.

1324
01:10:21.113 --> 01:10:22.286
Seconds before
it should've hit the ground,

1325
01:10:22.287 --> 01:10:23.632
it just blew apart in the sky.

1326
01:10:23.633 --> 01:10:26.117
How much time is there?

1327
01:10:26.118 --> 01:10:29.052
Projected impact
is in 45 minutes.

1328
01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.089
You know we have
no road out of here, tad.

1329
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:36.507
I've contacted general Wade
at northcom.

1330
01:10:36.508 --> 01:10:38.026
I put in a request for

1331
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.132
as many choppers
as they can spare.

1332
01:10:40.133 --> 01:10:42.685
A request?

1333
01:10:42.686 --> 01:10:43.411
There are 1900 people
in cottonwood, Anna.

1334
01:10:44.895 --> 01:10:46.862
There are tens of thousands more
in towns all across the rockies.

1335
01:10:46.863 --> 01:10:49.692
There just aren't
enough helicopters.

1336
01:10:49.693 --> 01:10:51.176
And there's
not enough time.

1337
01:10:51.177 --> 01:10:53.627
I'm sorry.

1338
01:10:53.628 --> 01:10:54.319
Do you believe in prayer, tad?

1339
01:10:57.701 --> 01:11:00.220
I believe in science.

1340
01:11:00.221 --> 01:11:02.567
But sometimes I hedge my bets.

1341
01:11:02.568 --> 01:11:04.639
Well, hedge one for US,
will you?

1342
01:11:21.449 --> 01:11:23.830
I'm so sorry.

1343
01:11:23.831 --> 01:11:27.386
We did everything
we could, but...

1344
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:30.872
Would you like me
to take you in?

1345
01:12:06.805 --> 01:12:10.498
Anna...

1346
01:12:13.225 --> 01:12:17.366
There's another one coming.

1347
01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:22.060
Bigger than all the others.

1348
01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:25.720
If it gets through,
no one will survive.

1349
01:12:28.482 --> 01:12:30.656
I can't do this
anymore.

1350
01:12:32.831 --> 01:12:33.901
I can't fix it.

1351
01:12:36.662 --> 01:12:40.907
I can't help the people
of this town.

1352
01:12:40.908 --> 01:12:44.359
I...

1353
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.809
I can't even reassure them.

1354
01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:49.364
That's
what I thought

1355
01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:50.537
until you led me
back here.

1356
01:12:50.538 --> 01:12:52.159
I'll have no regrets
about today,

1357
01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.092
because I know
I did everything that I could.

1358
01:12:54.093 --> 01:12:56.717
And that's because of you.

1359
01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:04.689
There are certain things

1360
01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:05.484
that can't be put in a box
and made all better.

1361
01:13:05.485 --> 01:13:08.624
Ricky's one of them.

1362
01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:12.179
Now Miriam is.

1363
01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.319
And what might happen
in that sky tonight is another.

1364
01:13:15.252 --> 01:13:16.392
For the last six months you've
been turning away from me.

1365
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:24.434
Away from Emily.

1366
01:13:25.539 --> 01:13:26.056
Away from everybody else
in this town.

1367
01:13:35.376 --> 01:13:39.000
You have 45 minutes, Anna.

1368
01:13:40.519 --> 01:13:44.109
What are you going to do
with them?

1369
01:14:01.367 --> 01:14:05.681
We can break in
in a moment, Anna.

1370
01:14:05.682 --> 01:14:06.890
I'll give you a cue.

1371
01:14:39.613 --> 01:14:43.099
Okay, Anna,
you're on the air.

1372
01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:55.628
This is mayor Anna Davenport.

1373
01:14:55.629 --> 01:14:58.494
I've just spoken to

1374
01:14:59.667 --> 01:15:00.805
the Colorado center
for emergency response.

1375
01:15:00.806 --> 01:15:06.052
The latest report from NASA

1376
01:15:06.053 --> 01:15:09.365
shows a large meteor headed for
possible impact with earth.

1377
01:15:09.366 --> 01:15:11.679
There is some hope that it
will explode in the
atmosphere.

1378
01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:16.063
But if it doesn't,

1379
01:15:17.478 --> 01:15:19.134
tracking has it making
landfall

1380
01:15:19.135 --> 01:15:21.826
somewhere between

1381
01:15:21.827 --> 01:15:23.276
the eastern rockies
and western Colorado.

1382
01:15:23.277 --> 01:15:27.176
The center of that radius is
right here in cottonwood.

1383
01:15:27.177 --> 01:15:30.077
The estimated time of impact
is in 35 minutes.

1384
01:15:32.597 --> 01:15:36.497
As your mayor, it is my duty
to give you this
information,

1385
01:15:38.257 --> 01:15:43.054
but there is no time
or means to flee.

1386
01:15:43.055 --> 01:15:47.334
There is only time to
reflect

1387
01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:49.820
on how you want to spend
this next half hour.

1388
01:15:49.821 --> 01:15:52.030
Some of you may want
to spend it alone,

1389
01:15:53.065 --> 01:15:56.482
others with your family.

1390
01:15:58.484 --> 01:16:02.040
I want to spend it
with my husband,

1391
01:16:02.834 --> 01:16:06.146
and my daughter,

1392
01:16:06.147 --> 01:16:07.010
and the rest of my family...
The people of this town.

1393
01:16:08.287 --> 01:16:13.153
I'm going now

1394
01:16:13.154 --> 01:16:14.983
to the cottonwood
community church.

1395
01:16:14.984 --> 01:16:17.192
I hope those of you
who want to

1396
01:16:17.193 --> 01:16:19.885
will join me there.

1397
01:16:37.454 --> 01:16:41.803
I have to stay.

1398
01:16:41.804 --> 01:16:44.358
I know.

1399
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:51.848
Anna...

1400
01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:55.611
Do you remember
when Ricky was four,

1401
01:16:58.924 --> 01:17:01.408
and he learned
how to snap his fingers?

1402
01:17:01.409 --> 01:17:02.169
He was so proud of himself.

1403
01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:06.104
And he didn't just snap them,

1404
01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:09.244
he flicked his wrist
like he was throwing dice.

1405
01:17:09.245 --> 01:17:11.660
He made up a game about it.

1406
01:17:11.661 --> 01:17:15.802
"Mad mommy," he called it.

1407
01:17:15.803 --> 01:17:19.012
I would have to pretend
to be mad at him.

1408
01:17:19.013 --> 01:17:20.704
"Ricky, you'd better clean
up those toys right now..."

1409
01:17:20.705 --> 01:17:22.638
Then he'd snap his fingers
and I'd have to be nice.

1410
01:17:30.266 --> 01:17:34.579
Thank you for Ricky.

1411
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.997
And thank you for Emily.

1412
01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:53.253
Emily, I'm really sorry
about this morning.

1413
01:17:53.254 --> 01:17:56.394
It's okay, mom.

1414
01:17:56.395 --> 01:17:58.811
I just wanted
so much to stay.

1415
01:17:58.812 --> 01:18:03.022
To hold on
to this place.

1416
01:18:03.023 --> 01:18:06.266
To Ricky.

1417
01:18:06.267 --> 01:18:09.373
And to Seth.

1418
01:18:09.374 --> 01:18:11.479
You really like him,
don't you?

1419
01:18:12.066 --> 01:18:13.791
Yeah. I do.

1420
01:18:13.792 --> 01:18:16.105
I should have
listened to you more.

1421
01:18:17.416 --> 01:18:17.900
I should have
talked to you more.

1422
01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:28.841
What's going
to happen tonight?

1423
01:18:28.842 --> 01:18:31.776
We're going
to be together.

1424
01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:55.246
Marty, what's wrong?
What's happening?

1425
01:18:55.247 --> 01:18:57.697
Schriever air force base
is sending a chopper.

1426
01:18:57.698 --> 01:18:58.492
It's on its way
here now.

1427
01:18:59.079 --> 01:19:00.735
One chopper?

1428
01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:03.530
How many does it hold?

1429
01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:04.325
It's an h-60.
The pilot plus 10.

1430
01:19:04.326 --> 01:19:07.707
10?

1431
01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:09.123
You're telling me
we can only save 10 people?

1432
01:19:10.435 --> 01:19:13.264
If it helps,
I took a head count.

1433
01:19:13.265 --> 01:19:15.232
How many children?

1434
01:19:15.233 --> 01:19:16.233
18 and under?
Yes.

1435
01:19:16.234 --> 01:19:17.337
More than 10.

1436
01:19:17.338 --> 01:19:18.339
There you go.

1437
01:19:19.616 --> 01:19:21.341
16 and under.

1438
01:19:21.342 --> 01:19:22.584
It's too many.
I'm not going.

1439
01:19:22.585 --> 01:19:24.241
Marty, 16 and under?
How many?

1440
01:19:24.242 --> 01:19:26.657
13, Anna.

1441
01:19:26.658 --> 01:19:28.348
Mom, I said
I'm not going.

1442
01:19:28.349 --> 01:19:29.488
You are going to
get on that helicopter.

1443
01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:33.665
Somehow, you are going
to get on that helicopter.

1444
01:19:33.666 --> 01:19:35.494
There isn't enough room.

1445
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:37.427
Emily, I want you
to survive.

1446
01:19:37.428 --> 01:19:39.498
Mom, it's okay.

1447
01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:41.500
I'm not afraid.

1448
01:19:42.087 --> 01:19:45.021
It's okay, mom.

1449
01:19:52.753 --> 01:19:56.515
How far is schriever
from here?

1450
01:19:57.068 --> 01:19:59.414
50 miles.

1451
01:19:59.415 --> 01:20:01.830
It'll be here.

1452
01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:03.383
Just keep
watching the sky.

1453
01:20:03.384 --> 01:20:06.697
Anna?

1454
01:20:06.698 --> 01:20:07.561
Tad, what's happening?

1455
01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:13.704
General Wade issued a calldown
of all his craft.

1456
01:20:13.705 --> 01:20:16.880
They're needed
in the regions

1457
01:20:16.881 --> 01:20:17.984
where more people live.

1458
01:20:17.985 --> 01:20:19.504
More people?

1459
01:20:20.332 --> 01:20:21.264
Or more important people?

1460
01:20:21.265 --> 01:20:23.196
I'm sorry, Anna.

1461
01:20:23.197 --> 01:20:25.682
I'm so sorry.

1462
01:20:35.692 --> 01:20:40.282
It's okay, Tyler.
I'm right here.

1463
01:20:40.283 --> 01:20:41.836
You're in the hospital, Tyler.

1464
01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:44.321
And Jack is taking care of you.

1465
01:20:44.322 --> 01:20:46.288
You've got a tube in your mouth,
so you can't talk now, Tyler,

1466
01:20:46.289 --> 01:20:49.084
but you're going
to be just fine.

1467
01:20:49.085 --> 01:20:51.604
Tyler, I've been here
the whole time.

1468
01:20:51.605 --> 01:20:52.778
And I'm not
going anywhere.

1469
01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:54.608
I'm not going
to leave your side.

1470
01:20:58.267 --> 01:21:02.891
You should go.

1471
01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:04.100
Go be with your family.
I'll cover here.

1472
01:21:29.298 --> 01:21:33.611
What should we do now?

1473
01:21:33.612 --> 01:21:36.476
Where should we go?

1474
01:21:36.477 --> 01:21:38.237
I think our odds of surviving
are better if we split up.

1475
01:21:38.238 --> 01:21:41.619
If we all huddle here
and the church gets hit,

1476
01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.519
who's going to make it
out of here alive?

1477
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.245
If we fan out
as far as we can,

1478
01:21:46.246 --> 01:21:47.109
we'll have a better
chance of survival.

1479
01:21:50.595 --> 01:21:54.116
Do you really want to survive

1480
01:21:55.255 --> 01:21:56.118
if the people you love don't?

1481
01:21:57.015 --> 01:21:57.913
I know I wouldn't.

1482
01:22:01.537 --> 01:22:05.403
Neither would I.

1483
01:22:21.246 --> 01:22:26.216
And I do believe,

1484
01:22:26.217 --> 01:22:27.045
if we stand together,
these moments will have meaning.

1485
01:22:27.528 --> 01:22:31.118
Emily.

1486
01:22:32.775 --> 01:22:33.500
Too bad Ricky's not around
to snap his fingers?

1487
01:22:36.917 --> 01:22:39.989
Maybe he is, baby.
Maybe he is.

1488
01:22:44.994 --> 01:22:46.133
Seth...

1489
01:23:11.883 --> 01:23:16.956
You've been an angel, Marty.

1490
01:23:24.585 --> 01:23:28.141
I'm so sorry about Miriam.

1491
01:23:28.934 --> 01:23:31.764
Thank you.

1492
01:23:49.231 --> 01:23:53.372
Mom?

1493
01:23:53.373 --> 01:23:54.305
Emily?

1494
01:23:54.306 --> 01:23:56.030
Emily!

1495
01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:56.962
God. My god.

1496
01:23:56.963 --> 01:23:59.620
Hey. Hey.

1497
01:24:07.525 --> 01:24:11.838
Good morning, folks,

1498
01:24:11.839 --> 01:24:13.771
dj Dan here again.

1499
01:24:13.772 --> 01:24:15.566
I have
another confession to make.

1500
01:24:15.567 --> 01:24:18.431
I fired my vedic
astrologer.

1501
01:24:18.432 --> 01:24:19.123
She tried to tell me not to
vote in today's election

1502
01:24:20.124 --> 01:24:24.023
for our new mayor.

1503
01:24:24.024 --> 01:24:26.232
She said I should embrace
whatever fate comes

1504
01:24:26.233 --> 01:24:28.614
and live my life
in sync with the stars.

1505
01:24:28.615 --> 01:24:32.411
I say she's a nut.

1506
01:24:32.412 --> 01:24:35.069
I'm voting.

1507
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.208
Because I'm a free-willed man,
and I make my own fate.

1508
01:24:36.209 --> 01:24:39.833
And so should you.

1509
01:24:45.563 --> 01:24:49.911
Are you hungry?

1510
01:24:49.912 --> 01:24:51.223
Yeah.

1511
01:24:51.224 --> 01:24:51.983
Can I get you anything else?

1512
01:24:55.297 --> 01:24:56.436
No, I'm great.
Thanks.

1513
01:25:25.534 --> 01:25:29.124
If this threesome's
at my doorstep,

1514
01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:32.160
there must be trouble.

1515
01:25:32.161 --> 01:25:32.817
We don't have any troubles,
do we, Millie?

1516
01:25:34.025 --> 01:25:37.510
The three of US are
getting along just fine.

1517
01:25:37.511 --> 01:25:39.340
Then why are you here?

1518
01:25:39.341 --> 01:25:41.963
Well, Anna,
it's customary

1519
01:25:41.964 --> 01:25:43.896
for the losing
candidate

1520
01:25:43.897 --> 01:25:45.622
to call the winner
and offer congratulations,

1521
01:25:45.623 --> 01:25:48.280
but under
the current circumstances,

1522
01:25:48.281 --> 01:25:50.247
we thought a face-to-face visit
was in order.

1523
01:25:50.248 --> 01:25:52.353
So, who's conceding to whom?

1524
01:25:52.354 --> 01:25:55.356
We are.

1525
01:25:55.357 --> 01:25:56.323
To you.

1526
01:25:56.324 --> 01:25:57.979
To me?

1527
01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:58.946
Marty won 2% of the vote
on a write-in.

1528
01:25:58.947 --> 01:26:01.156
Millie won 12%.

1529
01:26:01.949 --> 01:26:04.606
And I won 26%.

1530
01:26:04.607 --> 01:26:05.746
The other 60% voted for you.

1531
01:26:06.609 --> 01:26:10.165
Great job!

1532
01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.304
Congratulations, Anna.

1533
01:26:12.305 --> 01:26:13.615
You did it.

1534
01:26:13.616 --> 01:26:15.134
What's going on out here?

1535
01:26:15.135 --> 01:26:16.411
Your mother
just got re-elected.

1536
01:26:16.412 --> 01:26:17.619
She did?

1537
01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.449
Well, what do you say?

1538
01:26:21.452 --> 01:26:24.938
Are we moving
to Chicago?

1539
01:26:29.218 --> 01:26:32.946
You want to help me
take down that sign?

1540
01:26:37.122 --> 01:26:41.264
Okay...
On three.

1541
01:26:41.265 --> 01:26:43.231
Okay.

1542
01:26:43.232 --> 01:26:44.233
One, two, three!
