1
00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:18.663
Thank you very much, sir.

2
00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.915
You did a wonderful job.
Wonderful.

3
00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:24.877
We did it, Pete. We did it.

4
00:01:26.963 --> 00:01:28.673
For a moment, we had our doubts.

5
00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:32.176
To continue, you've listened to
a long and complex case.

6
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.053
Murder in the first degree.

7
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:39.100
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

8
00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:40.935
You've listened to the testimony.

9
00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:43.938
You've had the law read to you
and interpreted as it applies in this case.

10
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:48.025
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

11
00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:52.488
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

12
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:57.285
If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds
as to the guilt of the accused...

13
00:01:57.368 --> 00:01:59.287
a reasonable doubt...

14
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.164
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

15
00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:04.125
Now if, however,
there's no reasonable doubt...

16
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:08.087
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

17
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:13.342
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

18
00:02:13.426 --> 00:02:16.804
In the event that you find
the accused guilty...

19
00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:20.224
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

20
00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:23.519
The death sentence
is mandatory in this case.

21
00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:27.315
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

22
00:02:29.317 --> 00:02:31.360
The alternate jurors are excused.

23
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:39.368
The jury will now retire.

24
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.363
Try this one.
See if I can get it.

25
00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:42.450
It's a muggy day.

26
00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:48.080
Hey...

27
00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:02.219
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

28
00:05:02.303 --> 00:05:04.388
This thing is...

29
00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:06.098
Move it.

30
00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:09.894
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

31
00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:11.312
That's it.

32
00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:18.569
- You know something?
- Yeah?

33
00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:20.404
I called the weather bureau this morning.

34
00:05:20.488 --> 00:05:22.406
This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.

35
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.074
Could be.

36
00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.076
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

37
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.497
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's... That one, yeah.

38
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.998
Thank you very much.

39
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.834
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

40
00:05:33.918 --> 00:05:36.754
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

41
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.089
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

42
00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:52.811
Good morning.

43
00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:54.355
I never knew they locked the door.

44
00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:56.607
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

45
00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.110
I don't know.
It just never occurred to me.

46
00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:03.531
What's that for?

47
00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:05.491
Oh, I thought we might want
to vote by ballot.

48
00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:08.244
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

49
00:06:10.496 --> 00:06:12.248
Just in case, you know.

50
00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:17.878
- How'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

51
00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:19.630
It was pretty interesting.

52
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.674
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

53
00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:24.343
I mean, I've never been
on a jury before.

54
00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.137
No?
I've sat on many juries.

55
00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:31.225
What gets me is the way those
lawyers talk and talk and talk...

56
00:06:31.308 --> 00:06:33.477
even when it's an open-and-shut
case like this one.

57
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.271
Did you ever hear
so much talk about nothin'?

58
00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:37.231
Well, I guess they're entitled.

59
00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:39.775
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...

60
00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:45.072
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids down
before they start any trouble.

61
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:47.241
It would save us a lot of time and money.

62
00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:48.867
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

63
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:51.579
Yeah, let's get goin', huh?
We probably all got things to do here.

64
00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:54.707
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute break.
There's one gentleman in the bathroom.

65
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.749
Mr. Foreman.

66
00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:58.627
- Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.

67
00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:00.462
I... Well, I guess so.

68
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:06.927
You're in my seat.

69
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:09.013
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

70
00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:13.309
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

71
00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.398
What did you think of the case?

72
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.525
I mean,
it had a lot of interest for me.

73
00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:24.737
No real dead spots.
You know what I mean?

74
00:07:25.613 --> 00:07:28.073
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

75
00:07:28.157 --> 00:07:30.117
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

76
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.453
Boy, they can be the dullest.

77
00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:35.331
Hey.

78
00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:36.999
That the Woolworth Building?

79
00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:39.001
That's right.

80
00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:40.669
Isn't that funny?

81
00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:43.130
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.

82
00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.299
If you had to sort out all that junk.

83
00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:47.468
Like that thing with the movies.

84
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:50.554
Yeah. You can say that again.
And what about that business with the knife?

85
00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:53.515
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

86
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:56.060
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

87
00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:58.604
Yeah, I guess so.

88
00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.397
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

89
00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:03.525
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

90
00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:05.819
These hot-weather colds can kill you.

91
00:08:05.903 --> 00:08:08.322
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

92
00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:11.950
I sure do.
I just got over one.

93
00:08:12.034 --> 00:08:14.787
Come on.
Mr. Foreman, let's go here, huh?

94
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.497
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.

95
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.416
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance
to see a paper this morning.

96
00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:23.087
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

97
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.881
You got a seat on the Exchange?

98
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.716
I'm a broker.

99
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.179
I run a messenger service,
the Beck and Call Company.

100
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.390
The name is my wife's idea.

101
00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:38.102
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

102
00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:41.355
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?

103
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.360
Yeah, we can all get outta here
pretty quick, huh?

104
00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:49.655
I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen
to have tickets to that ball game tonight.

105
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.573
Yanks and Cleveland.

106
00:08:51.657 --> 00:08:53.450
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

107
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.202
He's a real bull, this kid.

108
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.413
You know... Phoom!

109
00:08:57.496 --> 00:08:59.748
A real jug handle. You know?

110
00:08:59.832 --> 00:09:02.084
Phoom!

111
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.503
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?
Yeah.

112
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.046
Where do we sit here?

113
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.216
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

114
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:11.719
One, two, three, four, five...
so on, around the table.

115
00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:13.053
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

116
00:09:13.137 --> 00:09:14.221
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

117
00:09:14.304 --> 00:09:17.349
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

118
00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:19.685
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...

119
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:23.021
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

120
00:09:23.105 --> 00:09:25.441
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

121
00:09:25.524 --> 00:09:27.234
Okay. Two. You're two.

122
00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:28.485
I beg pardon?

123
00:09:28.569 --> 00:09:32.740
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

124
00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:35.951
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

125
00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:39.037
I think he did an expert job.

126
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.124
A lot of drive too, you know?
Real drive.

127
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.293
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.

128
00:09:44.376 --> 00:09:45.961
Fellas.

129
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:49.506
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

130
00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:53.343
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

131
00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:57.097
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it?
Kid kills his father, bing, just like that.

132
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.767
Listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

133
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.769
They let those kids
run wild up there.

134
00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:04.563
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

135
00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:06.231
Is everyone here?

136
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:08.150
The old man is inside.

137
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.861
Would you
knock on the door for him?

138
00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.905
You a Yankee fan?

139
00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:14.531
No. Baltimore.

140
00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:16.950
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

141
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.788
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

142
00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:23.791
Who have they got?

143
00:10:23.874 --> 00:10:26.293
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

144
00:10:26.376 --> 00:10:27.920
Say, we'd like to get started.

145
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:31.048
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

146
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.634
Baltimore?

147
00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:36.512
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

148
00:10:36.595 --> 00:10:39.556
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

149
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.142
I'm... You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

150
00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:45.521
We can, well, discuss it first
and then vote on it.

151
00:10:45.604 --> 00:10:48.273
That's, of course...
That's one way.

152
00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:51.318
And, well, we can vote on it
right now, and...

153
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:53.904
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

154
00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.574
Yeah, let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

155
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:02.538
Okay, then I think that...

156
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:05.499
Of course you know that we have
a first-degree murder charge here...

157
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.668
and if we vote the accused guilty...

158
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:11.004
we've got to send him
to the chair.

159
00:11:11.088 --> 00:11:14.842
- That's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

160
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:16.677
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

161
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.556
- Okay. Anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

162
00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:26.353
Okay. Then just remember that
this has to be 12 to nothing either way.

163
00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:27.896
That's the law.

164
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.023
Okay, are we ready?

165
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:33.110
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

166
00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:40.617
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

167
00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:44.538
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

168
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:47.541
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

169
00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.126
Those voting not guilty.

170
00:11:50.294 --> 00:11:52.379
One. Right.

171
00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.756
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

172
00:11:55.674 --> 00:11:57.259
Well, now we know where we are.

173
00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:01.513
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

174
00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.349
So, what do we do now?

175
00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:06.268
Well, I guess we talk.

176
00:12:06.351 --> 00:12:07.686
Boy, oh, boy.

177
00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.605
You really think he's innocent?

178
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.610
I don't know.

179
00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:17.571
I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.

180
00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:19.781
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

181
00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:21.491
He's 18 years old.

182
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:23.660
Well, that's old enough.
He...

183
00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:26.413
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

184
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.749
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

185
00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:31.376
Would you like me to list them for you?

186
00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.753
No.

187
00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.922
Then what do you want?

188
00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.925
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

189
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.343
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

190
00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.678
No one had to think about it twice
except you.

191
00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:44.973
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

192
00:12:45.057 --> 00:12:47.768
I don't know whether I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.

193
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.436
So how come you vote not guilty?

194
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.438
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.

195
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:54.274
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

196
00:12:54.358 --> 00:12:56.443
without talking about it first.

197
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.946
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

198
00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:02.407
What, just because I voted fast?

199
00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:04.910
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

200
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:07.788
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked for a hundred years.

201
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.873
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...

202
00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.709
We're talking about somebody's life here.

203
00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.878
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

204
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:16.380
Supposing we're wrong.

205
00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.465
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

206
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.550
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

207
00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:23.136
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

208
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.806
Suppose we do it in five minutes.
So what?

209
00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:28.016
Let's take an hour.

210
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.018
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

211
00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.901
Who's got something to say?

212
00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:39.403
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

213
00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.197
Great. I heard
a pretty good story last night.

214
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.366
That's not why we're sitting here.

215
00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:48.620
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

216
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.707
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

217
00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:56.169
Look, this kid's been kicked around
all of his life...

218
00:13:56.253 --> 00:14:00.173
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

219
00:14:00.257 --> 00:14:02.467
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...

220
00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:05.470
his father was serving a jail term
for forgery.

221
00:14:05.554 --> 00:14:07.889
It's not a very happy beginning.

222
00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:10.100
He's a wild, angry kid.

223
00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.893
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

224
00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:15.689
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

225
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.983
He's had a...
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

226
00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:21.028
I just think we owe him a few words.
That's all.

227
00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:24.656
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

228
00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.826
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

229
00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:30.996
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- You know it.

230
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:33.415
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

231
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.375
We heard the facts, didn't we?

232
00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:39.254
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

233
00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:41.715
Listen, I've lived among them
all my life.

234
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:45.135
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

235
00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:47.054
I mean, they're born liars.

236
00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:50.474
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...

237
00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:53.393
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

238
00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:56.063
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

239
00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:58.231
Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

240
00:14:58.315 --> 00:15:00.567
Come on. We have a job to do.
Now let's do it.

241
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.654
Rice Pops.
It's a product I work on at the agency.

242
00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:08.116
The breakfast with the built-in bounce.

243
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.826
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

244
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.079
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

245
00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:13.872
Oh, I'm sorry.

246
00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:16.416
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

247
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.210
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

248
00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:20.003
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

249
00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:22.297
Okay...

250
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.176
Perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...

251
00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.554
Well, perhaps you could tell us why.
You know, let us know what you're thinking.

252
00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:32.015
And we might be able to show you
where you're mixed up.

253
00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:33.767
Well, look,
maybe this is an idea.

254
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.269
Now, I haven't given it much thought,
but it seems to me...

255
00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:40.774
that it's up to the group of us to convince
this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.

256
00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:43.401
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to...

257
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.238
Well, it was just a quick idea.

258
00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.781
No, no, no. That's a good one.

259
00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.951
Suppose we go
once around the table.

260
00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:53.912
I guess you're first.

261
00:15:53.995 --> 00:15:55.330
Well...

262
00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.292
Well, it's hard to put into words.

263
00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.337
I just think he's guilty.

264
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.923
I thought it was obvious
from the word go.

265
00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.508
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

266
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.135
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

267
00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:10.470
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

268
00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:13.014
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

269
00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:16.226
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

270
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:18.270
What I meant was, is...

271
00:16:20.063 --> 00:16:22.065
Well, I just think he's guilty.

272
00:16:22.149 --> 00:16:23.859
I mean, somebody saw him do it.

273
00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:28.989
Okay. Here's what I think,
and I have no personal feelings about this.

274
00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.241
I just want to talk about facts.

275
00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.369
Number one.

276
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:39.040
The old man lived downstairs under the room
where the killing took place.

277
00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:41.251
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

278
00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:45.005
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

279
00:16:45.088 --> 00:16:47.966
And he heard the kid yell out,
I'm gonna kill ya.

280
00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:50.343
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

281
00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.137
Ran to the door, opened it up...

282
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.639
saw the kid running down the stairs
and out of the house.

283
00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:56.016
Called the police.

284
00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.768
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.

285
00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:02.105
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.

286
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:05.275
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

287
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.527
The kid is guilty.

288
00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:09.613
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.

289
00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:13.575
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

290
00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:15.118
I'm with you.

291
00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:17.746
Okay. Are you finished?

292
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.289
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

293
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:22.584
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

294
00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.878
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

295
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.505
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw.

296
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.424
- Or who played in them.
- That's right.

297
00:17:29.507 --> 00:17:31.801
And no one saw him going in
or out of the theater.

298
00:17:31.885 --> 00:17:33.511
Listen, what about the woman
across the street?

299
00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:35.889
If her testimony don't prove it,
nothing does.

300
00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:38.308
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

301
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:40.810
Now, fellas, please.
Let's go in order here, huh?

302
00:17:40.894 --> 00:17:44.147
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

303
00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:46.691
Here's a woman who was lying in bed.
She can't sleep.

304
00:17:46.775 --> 00:17:48.693
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

305
00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:50.612
Anyway, she looks out the window...

306
00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:54.282
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

307
00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:57.244
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

308
00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.204
Everything fits.

309
00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:01.122
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

310
00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.333
His window is right opposite hers
across the el tracks...

311
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.085
and she swore she saw him do it.

312
00:18:05.168 --> 00:18:07.837
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.

313
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:12.092
This el train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.

314
00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:15.095
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

315
00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:17.597
you can look through the windows
of an el train when the lights are out...

316
00:18:17.681 --> 00:18:20.016
and see what's happening
on the other side.

317
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.936
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

318
00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.689
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

319
00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.524
She's one of them too, isn't she?

320
00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:32.195
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?

321
00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:33.697
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

322
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.991
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

323
00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:38.618
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

324
00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:41.955
Okay, now come on.
Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.

325
00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:43.290
Whose turn is it next?

326
00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:46.209
Oh, his. Number five.

327
00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:51.214
Okay, may I... Can I pass?

328
00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:54.050
Well, that's your privilege.

329
00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:57.262
How about the next gentleman?

330
00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:00.015
Well, I don't know.

331
00:19:00.098 --> 00:19:04.311
I started to be convinced, you know,
very early in the case.

332
00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:09.024
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

333
00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:13.320
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

334
00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:16.489
Anyway, that testimony
from those people...

335
00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:19.617
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment.

336
00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:21.953
That was very powerful.

337
00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:24.831
Didn't they say something about
a fight and an argument...

338
00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:29.336
between the old man and his son
around about 7:00 that night?

339
00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:31.880
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I...
- It was 8:00.

340
00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:34.007
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

341
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:35.842
They couldn't hear what it was about.

342
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.886
Then they heard
the father hit the boy twice.

343
00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:40.930
Finally they saw the boy
run angrily out of the house.

344
00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.599
What does that prove?

345
00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:46.353
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

346
00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:49.356
Well, you said it provided a motive.
The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

347
00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:51.691
I don't think
that was a very strong motive.

348
00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:55.362
This boy's been hit so many times in his life
that violence is practically a...

349
00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.822
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

350
00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:02.118
I just... I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

351
00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:05.789
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

352
00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.418
Anything else?

353
00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.962
- No.
- Okay.

354
00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.798
How about you?

355
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.593
I don't know. It's all been said.

356
00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:22.764
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

357
00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:26.935
This kid is five for 0.

358
00:20:27.018 --> 00:20:28.895
Well, look at his record.

359
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.189
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

360
00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.066
He threw a rock at a teacher.

361
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.443
When he was 15,
he was in reform school.

362
00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.362
He stole a car.

363
00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.948
He's been arrested for mugging.

364
00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:42.033
He was picked up twice
for knife fighting.

365
00:20:42.117 --> 00:20:44.202
Oh, yeah, they say
he's real handy with a knife.

366
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:47.080
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

367
00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:50.166
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

368
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.669
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

369
00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.254
A kid like that?

370
00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:57.507
It's these kids,
the way they are nowadays.

371
00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:03.179
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father sir.

372
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.223
That's right. Sir.

373
00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.267
Do you ever hear a kid
call his father that anymore?

374
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.853
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important anymore.

375
00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:12.689
- You got any kids?
- Three.

376
00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:15.400
I got one.

377
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.653
Twenty-two years old.

378
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:27.537
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

379
00:21:29.247 --> 00:21:32.417
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

380
00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:38.715
I said, I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying.

381
00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:43.136
Well, I made a man out of him.

382
00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:46.306
When he was 16, we had a fight.

383
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:50.268
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

384
00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.773
Haven't seen him for two years.

385
00:21:57.692 --> 00:21:59.986
Kids.

386
00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:03.656
Work your heart out.

387
00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:07.494
Well, let's get going.

388
00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:09.913
I think we're missing the point here.

389
00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:13.416
This boy, let's say he's the product
of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

390
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.086
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

391
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.089
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

392
00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:22.884
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

393
00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:24.844
I know it, and so do you.

394
00:22:24.928 --> 00:22:29.641
It's no secret children from slum backgrounds
are potential menaces to society.

395
00:22:29.724 --> 00:22:31.893
- Now I think...
- Brother, you can say that again.

396
00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:34.521
The kids who crawl out of these places
are real trash.

397
00:22:34.604 --> 00:22:36.856
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

398
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.652
- I've lived in a slum all my life.
- Wait a minute.

399
00:22:40.735 --> 00:22:44.155
Please, I played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.

400
00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:46.282
I mean, maybe you can still
smell it on me.

401
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:47.700
Now, listen, sonny.

402
00:22:47.784 --> 00:22:49.369
Come on now.
There's nothing personal about this.

403
00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:51.996
- No, there was something personal.
- Come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

404
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.165
Let's not be so sensitive.

405
00:22:54.249 --> 00:22:56.084
This sensitivity I can understand.

406
00:22:56.167 --> 00:23:00.797
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...

407
00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:04.092
Look, your turn down there.
Let's go.

408
00:23:05.426 --> 00:23:08.263
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

409
00:23:08.346 --> 00:23:10.098
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

410
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.392
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

411
00:23:12.475 --> 00:23:14.811
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

412
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:17.605
Oh, now wait a minute.
We decided to do this a certain way.

413
00:23:17.689 --> 00:23:19.315
I think we ought to stick to that way.

414
00:23:19.399 --> 00:23:21.401
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

415
00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:23.486
- What do you mean, a kid?
- What do you think I mean?

416
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.196
K-I-D. Kid.

417
00:23:27.782 --> 00:23:31.452
What? Listen, just because I'm trying
to keep this thing organized?

418
00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:33.663
Here, you take it.
You take on the responsibility.

419
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.623
I'll just... I'll keep my mouth shut.
That's all.

420
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:37.709
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

421
00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:39.127
Don't tell me to calm down.

422
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.337
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

423
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.881
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

424
00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:45.925
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.

425
00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:47.594
The whole thing's unimportant.
Come on.

426
00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:50.805
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

427
00:23:50.888 --> 00:23:52.640
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

428
00:23:52.724 --> 00:23:55.560
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.

429
00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:57.520
You stay in there and pitch.
You know?

430
00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:00.690
All right.
Let's hear from somebody.

431
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:06.279
Well, if you want me to tell you
how I feel about it, it's all right with me.

432
00:24:06.362 --> 00:24:08.489
Boy, I don't care what you do.

433
00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:11.451
All right,
I don't have anything brilliant.

434
00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:13.661
I only know as much as you do.

435
00:24:13.745 --> 00:24:17.498
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

436
00:24:17.582 --> 00:24:21.753
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

437
00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:24.088
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?

438
00:24:24.172 --> 00:24:26.633
I began to get a peculiar feeling
about this trial.

439
00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:28.801
I mean, nothing is that positive.

440
00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:31.012
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

441
00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:33.806
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...

442
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.850
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

443
00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:38.436
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

444
00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:41.898
I mean, he let too many things go by,
little things that...

445
00:24:41.981 --> 00:24:44.734
What little things? Listen,
when these fellas don't ask questions...

446
00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:47.320
it's because they know the answers already
and they figure they'll be hurt.

447
00:24:47.403 --> 00:24:51.324
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

448
00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:52.700
I mean it's possible.

449
00:24:52.784 --> 00:24:54.452
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

450
00:24:57.538 --> 00:25:00.249
I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

451
00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:04.212
I'd have asked for another lawyer,
I think.

452
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:06.839
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...

453
00:25:06.923 --> 00:25:11.719
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

454
00:25:11.803 --> 00:25:15.765
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness
to this killing.

455
00:25:16.307 --> 00:25:19.686
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

456
00:25:19.769 --> 00:25:21.896
And there was a lot
of circumstantial evidence.

457
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:25.483
But actually, those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.

458
00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:27.360
Supposing they're wrong.

459
00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:29.237
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

460
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.197
What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

461
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.908
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

462
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:35.535
Those people sat on the stand under oath.

463
00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:37.161
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

464
00:25:37.245 --> 00:25:38.955
Could they be wrong?

465
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:42.667
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

466
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.585
Oh, come on.
Nobody can know a thing like that.

467
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:46.379
This isn't an exact science.

468
00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:47.797
That's right. It isn't.

469
00:25:52.969 --> 00:25:55.722
Okay, let's get to the point.

470
00:25:55.805 --> 00:25:58.391
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?

471
00:25:58.474 --> 00:26:00.893
Wait a minute.
There's some people who haven't talked yet.

472
00:26:00.977 --> 00:26:02.979
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

473
00:26:03.062 --> 00:26:05.398
Be quiet a second, will you?

474
00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:06.774
What about it, this...

475
00:26:06.858 --> 00:26:10.319
the knife this fine upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

476
00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:11.738
Let's talk about it.

477
00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:14.073
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

478
00:26:14.157 --> 00:26:15.908
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

479
00:26:15.992 --> 00:26:19.078
We all saw what it looks like.
Why do we have to see it again?

480
00:26:19.162 --> 00:26:21.122
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

481
00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:24.792
Say, could you bring us the knife?

482
00:26:24.876 --> 00:26:26.669
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

483
00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:31.591
The knife and the way it was bought
is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

484
00:26:31.674 --> 00:26:33.342
- I do.
- Good.

485
00:26:33.426 --> 00:26:35.928
Now, suppose we take these facts
one at a time.

486
00:26:36.012 --> 00:26:39.265
One. The boy admitted going out of the house
at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

487
00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:41.267
after being slapped several times
by his father.

488
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:44.103
No, no. No, he didn't say slapped.
He said punched.

489
00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:46.606
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.

490
00:26:46.689 --> 00:26:49.275
After being hit several times
by his father.

491
00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:51.611
Two. He went directly
to a neighborhood junk shop...

492
00:26:51.694 --> 00:26:53.821
- where he bought one of those...
- Switch knives.

493
00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:55.907
Switchblade knives.

494
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:57.784
This wasn't what you'd call
an ordinary knife.

495
00:26:57.867 --> 00:27:00.369
It had a very unusual carved handle
and blade.

496
00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:01.954
The storekeeper who sold it to him...

497
00:27:02.038 --> 00:27:05.166
said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock.

498
00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:09.003
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

499
00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:10.588
Am I right so far?

500
00:27:10.671 --> 00:27:12.799
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

501
00:27:12.882 --> 00:27:16.052
He talked with his friends for about an hour,
leaving them at 9:45.

502
00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:19.096
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

503
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.973
Four.

504
00:27:21.057 --> 00:27:23.476
They identified the death weapon
in court...

505
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:26.062
as that very same knife.

506
00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:28.940
Five.
He arrived home at about 10:00.

507
00:27:29.023 --> 00:27:31.359
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

508
00:27:31.442 --> 00:27:33.361
begin to diverge slightly.

509
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:36.030
He claims that he went to a movie
at about 11:30...

510
00:27:36.113 --> 00:27:40.159
returning home at 3:10 to find
his father dead and himself arrested.

511
00:27:40.243 --> 00:27:42.286
He also claims that
the two detectives who arrested him...

512
00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.664
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

513
00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:46.582
Now, what happened to the switch knife?

514
00:27:46.666 --> 00:27:49.293
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...

515
00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:54.048
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

516
00:27:54.131 --> 00:27:56.092
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

517
00:27:56.175 --> 00:27:59.679
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

518
00:27:59.762 --> 00:28:01.722
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

519
00:28:01.806 --> 00:28:03.307
No one at the theater identified him.

520
00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:05.518
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.

521
00:28:08.563 --> 00:28:10.273
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

522
00:28:10.356 --> 00:28:13.568
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father...

523
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:17.363
stabbed him to death and left
the house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

524
00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:20.199
He even remembered to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints.

525
00:28:20.283 --> 00:28:22.910
Now are you trying to tell me
that this knife...

526
00:28:22.994 --> 00:28:24.912
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...

527
00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:27.373
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...

528
00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:30.126
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

529
00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:32.211
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...

530
00:28:32.295 --> 00:28:34.505
and that somebody else stabbed his father
with a similar knife.

531
00:28:34.589 --> 00:28:35.798
It's just possible.

532
00:28:35.882 --> 00:28:37.466
Take a look at this knife.

533
00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:41.596
It's a very unusual knife.

534
00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:43.222
I've never seen one like it.

535
00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:46.100
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

536
00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:49.145
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

537
00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:51.564
I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.

538
00:28:51.647 --> 00:28:53.149
And I say it's not possible.

539
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.490
Where did that come from?

540
00:29:01.574 --> 00:29:02.950
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

541
00:29:03.034 --> 00:29:04.535
What do you think you're doing?

542
00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:06.245
Where did you get it?

543
00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:08.581
I went out walking
for a couple of hours last night.

544
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:10.666
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.

545
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.753
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

546
00:29:13.836 --> 00:29:15.296
It cost six dollars.

547
00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:18.507
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.

548
00:29:18.591 --> 00:29:20.843
That's right. I broke the law.

549
00:29:20.927 --> 00:29:24.931
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

550
00:29:25.014 --> 00:29:27.099
Maybe there are 10 knives like that.
So what?

551
00:29:27.183 --> 00:29:29.977
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

552
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:33.356
You found another knife like it. What's that,
the discovery of the age or something?

553
00:29:33.439 --> 00:29:35.775
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

554
00:29:35.858 --> 00:29:37.652
with exactly the same kind of knife?

555
00:29:37.735 --> 00:29:38.986
The odds are a million-to-one.

556
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.781
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

557
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.992
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

558
00:29:45.076 --> 00:29:46.702
There's no point in standing around
all over the place.

559
00:29:48.746 --> 00:29:52.166
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a knife
exactly like the one the boy bought.

560
00:29:52.249 --> 00:29:55.002
What's interesting about it?
Interesting.

561
00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:56.963
Well, I don't know.
I just thought it was interesting.

562
00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:58.839
There are still 11 of us here
who think he's guilty.

563
00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:01.217
Right. What do you think
you're gonna accomplish?

564
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.135
You're not gonna change anybody's mind.

565
00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.596
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

566
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.724
The kid will be tried again
and found guilty sure as he's born.

567
00:30:10.267 --> 00:30:12.144
That's probably right.

568
00:30:12.228 --> 00:30:15.439
So what are you gonna do?
You know, we could be here all night.

569
00:30:15.523 --> 00:30:18.776
It's only one night.
A boy may die.

570
00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:21.404
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

571
00:30:21.487 --> 00:30:23.948
Someone send for Potsy the policeman
and get a pinochle deck...

572
00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:26.534
and we'll just sweat
the whole thing out right here.

573
00:30:28.035 --> 00:30:31.080
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

574
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:34.834
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

575
00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:37.837
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

576
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.715
You guys can talk the ears right off my head.
You know what I mean?

577
00:30:40.798 --> 00:30:43.509
I got three garages of mine goin' to pot
while you're talking.

578
00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:45.261
So let's get done and get outta here.

579
00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:48.764
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...

580
00:30:48.848 --> 00:30:51.308
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

581
00:30:51.392 --> 00:30:52.852
Hey, let's hold it down.

582
00:30:52.935 --> 00:30:55.271
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

583
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:59.525
Well, what about it?

584
00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:01.110
You're the only one.

585
00:31:09.035 --> 00:31:11.078
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

586
00:31:12.163 --> 00:31:13.914
I'm gonna call for another vote.

587
00:31:15.374 --> 00:31:20.588
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

588
00:31:20.671 --> 00:31:22.715
I'll abstain.

589
00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:25.593
If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

590
00:31:25.676 --> 00:31:29.472
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

591
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:34.643
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

592
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.900
Well, that's it.
If you want to try it, I'm ready.

593
00:31:40.983 --> 00:31:42.443
All right.
Let's do it the hard way.

594
00:31:42.526 --> 00:31:44.445
Okay, that sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?

595
00:31:44.528 --> 00:31:46.614
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

596
00:31:46.697 --> 00:31:47.740
Here, pass these along.

597
00:31:47.823 --> 00:31:49.575
Is that the right time?

598
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:22.817
Guilty.

599
00:32:25.486 --> 00:32:26.654
Guilty.

600
00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:30.074
Guilty.

601
00:32:32.409 --> 00:32:33.577
Guilty.

602
00:32:35.079 --> 00:32:36.247
Guilty.

603
00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:39.333
Guilty.

604
00:32:41.502 --> 00:32:42.670
Guilty.

605
00:32:43.838 --> 00:32:45.005
Guilty.

606
00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:47.466
Guilty.

607
00:32:51.554 --> 00:32:54.181
Not guilty.

608
00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:55.683
Guilty.

609
00:32:55.766 --> 00:32:57.434
Boy, how do you like that?

610
00:32:57.518 --> 00:32:59.979
And another chap flaps his wings.

611
00:33:00.062 --> 00:33:02.815
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

612
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:05.151
Excuse me.
This was a secret ballot.

613
00:33:05.234 --> 00:33:06.777
We all agreed on that, no?

614
00:33:06.861 --> 00:33:08.988
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret...

615
00:33:09.071 --> 00:33:10.948
Secret?
What do you mean secret?

616
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:14.243
There are no secrets in a jury room.
I know who it was.

617
00:33:14.994 --> 00:33:16.912
Brother, you really are something.

618
00:33:16.996 --> 00:33:18.998
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

619
00:33:19.081 --> 00:33:22.376
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

620
00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:25.754
about some underprivileged kid
just couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

621
00:33:25.838 --> 00:33:27.339
and you change your vote.

622
00:33:27.423 --> 00:33:29.550
If that isn't the most sick...

623
00:33:29.633 --> 00:33:33.304
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

624
00:33:33.387 --> 00:33:35.347
Oh, now just wait a minute.

625
00:33:35.431 --> 00:33:37.016
Listen,
you can't talk to me like that.

626
00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:38.934
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

627
00:33:39.018 --> 00:33:41.353
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?

628
00:33:41.437 --> 00:33:44.899
- It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

629
00:33:44.982 --> 00:33:47.818
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

630
00:33:47.902 --> 00:33:50.571
Someone starts telling us fairy tales,
and we're listenin'!

631
00:33:50.654 --> 00:33:52.406
Hey, come on, huh?

632
00:33:52.489 --> 00:33:54.408
What made you change your vote?

633
00:33:54.491 --> 00:33:56.118
He didn't change his vote.

634
00:33:56.202 --> 00:33:57.369
I did.

635
00:33:57.453 --> 00:33:59.413
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

636
00:33:59.496 --> 00:34:01.457
Would you like me to tell you why?

637
00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.417
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

638
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.045
I'd like to make it clear anyway,
if you don't mind.

639
00:34:06.128 --> 00:34:07.630
Do we have to listen to this?

640
00:34:07.713 --> 00:34:09.465
The man wants to talk.

641
00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:11.133
Thank you.

642
00:34:11.217 --> 00:34:14.553
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

643
00:34:14.637 --> 00:34:16.889
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

644
00:34:16.972 --> 00:34:18.933
He just isn't sure.

645
00:34:19.016 --> 00:34:21.852
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

646
00:34:21.936 --> 00:34:25.064
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

647
00:34:25.147 --> 00:34:26.857
I respect his motives.

648
00:34:26.941 --> 00:34:31.487
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but I want to hear more.

649
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.364
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

650
00:34:33.447 --> 00:34:35.699
I'm talking here!
You have no right to leave this room!

651
00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:37.660
He can't hear you.
He never will.

652
00:34:37.743 --> 00:34:39.328
Let's sit down.

653
00:34:43.499 --> 00:34:45.709
Shall we continue?

654
00:34:45.793 --> 00:34:48.003
Well, I think we ought
to take a break.

655
00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:52.216
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.

656
00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:55.261
Okay.

657
00:34:55.344 --> 00:34:57.096
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

658
00:34:58.472 --> 00:35:00.808
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

659
00:35:02.893 --> 00:35:05.354
I wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.

660
00:35:08.482 --> 00:35:11.944
You know, in advertising,
I told you I worked in an agency.

661
00:35:13.112 --> 00:35:15.114
Well, there's some pretty strange people
working there.

662
00:35:15.197 --> 00:35:17.283
Well, they're not strange really, I guess.

663
00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:19.994
It's just that they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

664
00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:21.328
You know what I mean.

665
00:35:21.412 --> 00:35:23.622
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

666
00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:25.874
What do you do?

667
00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:28.127
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

668
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.422
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

669
00:35:31.505 --> 00:35:34.508
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an agency,
when we reach a point like this...

670
00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:38.095
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency,
when a point like this is reached in a meeting...

671
00:35:38.178 --> 00:35:40.806
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

672
00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:42.850
And it kills me.

673
00:35:42.933 --> 00:35:44.435
It's the weirdest thing in the world...

674
00:35:44.518 --> 00:35:47.855
the way they sometimes precede their idea
with a little phrase, see, like...

675
00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:50.858
Some account exec will get up,
and he'll say...

676
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:52.776
Okay, here's an idea.

677
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.488
Let's run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it.

678
00:35:56.572 --> 00:35:59.700
I mean, it's idiotic,
but it's funny, huh?

679
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:04.288
I got a little excited back there.
I...

680
00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:07.041
didn't mean to get nasty.

681
00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:11.712
I'm glad you're not one of those
lets these emotional appeals influence him.

682
00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:31.106
I don't know what's the matter with that fan.
Can't seem to get it to start.

683
00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:43.035
Hey, you a salesman?

684
00:36:43.118 --> 00:36:44.620
I'm an architect.

685
00:36:46.872 --> 00:36:49.124
You know what the soft sell is?

686
00:36:52.044 --> 00:36:53.962
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

687
00:36:55.631 --> 00:36:57.341
I got a different technique.

688
00:36:58.133 --> 00:36:59.927
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

689
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.262
Tricks. You know?

690
00:37:03.097 --> 00:37:04.306
Yeah.

691
00:37:05.766 --> 00:37:07.976
Hit 'em where they live.
That's my motto.

692
00:37:09.395 --> 00:37:12.147
I made 27 grand last year
sellin' marmalade.

693
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:15.484
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.

694
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:20.489
Hey, what are you
gettin' outta this... kicks?

695
00:37:22.658 --> 00:37:25.244
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?

696
00:37:25.327 --> 00:37:27.037
Maybe.

697
00:37:28.038 --> 00:37:30.582
You know,
you do-gooders are all alike.

698
00:37:30.666 --> 00:37:33.335
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

699
00:37:36.422 --> 00:37:38.257
But what are you wasting our time for?

700
00:37:39.007 --> 00:37:43.053
Why don't you donate five dollars to the cause,
and maybe it'll make you feel better.

701
00:37:46.348 --> 00:37:48.600
This kid is guilty, pal.

702
00:37:48.684 --> 00:37:51.103
It's as plain as the nose
on your face.

703
00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:53.439
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

704
00:37:53.522 --> 00:37:56.442
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

705
00:37:56.525 --> 00:37:58.819
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?

706
00:37:59.862 --> 00:38:02.781
Oh, no difference, pal.

707
00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:04.658
No difference at all.

708
00:38:16.587 --> 00:38:18.464
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

709
00:38:18.547 --> 00:38:20.841
Oh, they're about the same
as anyone else.

710
00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:23.719
Boy, what a murderous day.

711
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.763
You think we'll be much longer?

712
00:38:26.847 --> 00:38:28.474
I don't know.

713
00:38:28.557 --> 00:38:30.476
He's guilty for sure.

714
00:38:30.559 --> 00:38:32.102
Not a doubt in the whole world.

715
00:38:32.186 --> 00:38:34.730
We should...
Should've been done already.

716
00:38:36.982 --> 00:38:38.233
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

717
00:38:38.317 --> 00:38:40.736
Beats workin'.

718
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:50.037
You think he's not guilty, huh?

719
00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.955
I don't know. It's possible.

720
00:38:52.706 --> 00:38:56.502
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

721
00:38:56.585 --> 00:38:59.004
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

722
00:38:59.087 --> 00:39:01.256
Supposing you were the one
who was on trial.

723
00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.967
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

724
00:39:04.051 --> 00:39:08.555
I'm just a workingman.
My boss does the supposing, but...

725
00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:10.140
Well, I'll try one.

726
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:17.022
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and
the kid really did knife his father.

727
00:39:25.948 --> 00:39:27.241
Are you ready?

728
00:39:28.617 --> 00:39:29.535
That one.

729
00:39:29.618 --> 00:39:31.286
Sorry, blue eyes.

730
00:39:32.204 --> 00:39:35.624
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

731
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:37.626
Looks like we'll be here
for dinner, huh?

732
00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:40.087
Okay, now let's...
Let's get down to business.

733
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.547
Now, who wants to start it off?

734
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.048
- I would.
- Okay, go.

735
00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:45.217
You down there.

736
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.179
The old man who lived downstairs says
he heard the kid yell out, I'm gonna kill ya.

737
00:39:49.263 --> 00:39:51.890
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.

738
00:39:51.974 --> 00:39:55.852
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

739
00:39:55.936 --> 00:39:57.312
What does that mean to you?

740
00:39:57.396 --> 00:40:00.774
I was wondering how clearly the old man could
have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.

741
00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:02.901
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

742
00:40:02.985 --> 00:40:04.820
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

743
00:40:04.903 --> 00:40:06.238
Well, it was another apartment.

744
00:40:06.321 --> 00:40:08.907
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.

745
00:40:08.991 --> 00:40:10.576
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

746
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:12.119
And don't forget the lady
across the street.

747
00:40:12.202 --> 00:40:14.997
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

748
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.541
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

749
00:40:17.624 --> 00:40:19.585
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

750
00:40:19.668 --> 00:40:21.503
It's like talking into a dead phone.

751
00:40:21.587 --> 00:40:24.756
She said she saw the killing through
the windows of a moving elevated train.

752
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.343
There were six cars on the train.
She saw the killing through the last two cars.

753
00:40:28.427 --> 00:40:30.262
She remembered
the most insignificant details.

754
00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:32.389
I don't see how you can argue with that.

755
00:40:32.472 --> 00:40:37.019
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

756
00:40:45.694 --> 00:40:47.279
Hey!

757
00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:48.864
This isn't a game.

758
00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.412
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

759
00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:57.247
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...

760
00:40:57.331 --> 00:41:00.584
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

761
00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:02.628
- This isn't a game?
- Calm down.

762
00:41:02.711 --> 00:41:06.048
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

763
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:09.468
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

764
00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:11.386
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

765
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.347
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

766
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:16.099
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

767
00:41:16.183 --> 00:41:18.060
I don't know.
Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

768
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:20.729
I think that's a pretty good guess.
Anyone else?

769
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:23.607
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

770
00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.525
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

771
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:27.527
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

772
00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:32.658
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

773
00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:36.995
Now let's say the given point is the open window
of the room where the killing took place.

774
00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:40.374
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

775
00:41:40.457 --> 00:41:41.958
Now let me ask you this.

776
00:41:42.042 --> 00:41:44.294
Has anyone here
ever lived near the el tracks?

777
00:41:44.378 --> 00:41:48.006
Well, I just finished painting an apartment
that overlooked an el line.

778
00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.758
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

779
00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:51.009
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

780
00:41:51.093 --> 00:41:53.637
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

781
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.306
I lived in a second-floor apartment
near the el line once.

782
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:59.434
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

783
00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:02.354
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- All right, you can't hear yourself think.

784
00:42:02.437 --> 00:42:04.856
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

785
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.568
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

786
00:42:08.652 --> 00:42:12.739
First. The old man
in the apartment downstairs.

787
00:42:12.823 --> 00:42:15.409
He says he heard the boy say
I'm gonna kill you...

788
00:42:15.492 --> 00:42:18.245
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

789
00:42:18.328 --> 00:42:19.913
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

790
00:42:19.996 --> 00:42:26.002
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

791
00:42:26.086 --> 00:42:29.423
and saw the killing through the last two cars
of the passing elevated train, right?

792
00:42:29.506 --> 00:42:31.842
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

793
00:42:31.925 --> 00:42:33.260
Now, just a minute.

794
00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:37.764
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

795
00:42:38.598 --> 00:42:41.935
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

796
00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:46.982
we can assume that the body
hit the floor just as the train went by.

797
00:42:47.065 --> 00:42:51.528
Therefore, the train had been roaring
by the old man's window...

798
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:55.115
a full 10 seconds
before the body hit the floor.

799
00:42:55.198 --> 00:42:57.409
The old man,
according to his own testimony...

800
00:42:57.492 --> 00:43:00.412
I'm gonna kill you, body hitting
the floor a split second later...

801
00:43:00.495 --> 00:43:02.956
would have had to hear the boy
make this statement...

802
00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:04.916
with the el roaring past his nose.

803
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.543
It's not possible he could've heard it.

804
00:43:06.626 --> 00:43:08.795
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

805
00:43:08.879 --> 00:43:11.256
He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
That's good enough for me.

806
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:13.592
Even if he heard something,
he still couldn't have identified the voice.

807
00:43:13.675 --> 00:43:14.801
With the el roaring by?

808
00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:17.262
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

809
00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:21.975
I think testimony that could put a boy
into the electric chair should be that accurate.

810
00:43:24.186 --> 00:43:26.104
You know something?
I don't think he could've heard it.

811
00:43:26.188 --> 00:43:28.523
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.

812
00:43:28.607 --> 00:43:30.484
Oh, what are you people talking about?

813
00:43:30.567 --> 00:43:32.611
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

814
00:43:32.694 --> 00:43:34.613
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

815
00:43:34.696 --> 00:43:36.907
Attention maybe.

816
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:38.909
You keep coming in
with these bright sayings!

817
00:43:38.992 --> 00:43:42.037
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

818
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.331
What are you talking to him
like that for?

819
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.710
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?

820
00:43:48.794 --> 00:43:50.629
You ought to have more respect, mister.

821
00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:56.218
If you say stuff like that to him again,
I'm gonna lay you out.

822
00:44:06.186 --> 00:44:09.147
Now you go ahead.
You say anything you like.

823
00:44:09.231 --> 00:44:13.276
Why do you think
the old man might lie?

824
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.780
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.

825
00:44:17.405 --> 00:44:20.659
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

826
00:44:20.742 --> 00:44:22.327
Or did you notice that?

827
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.913
I mean, to come to court like that.

828
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:26.665
Why...

829
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:31.670
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

830
00:44:31.753 --> 00:44:34.631
And he walked very slowly
to the stand.

831
00:44:35.382 --> 00:44:39.427
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...

832
00:44:39.511 --> 00:44:41.179
because he was ashamed.

833
00:44:42.305 --> 00:44:45.725
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

834
00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:52.023
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...

835
00:44:52.107 --> 00:44:54.484
who has been nothing all his life...

836
00:44:54.568 --> 00:44:56.987
who has never had recognition...

837
00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.155
or his name in the newspapers.

838
00:44:59.823 --> 00:45:02.033
Nobody knows him.

839
00:45:02.117 --> 00:45:04.160
Nobody quotes him.

840
00:45:04.244 --> 00:45:08.206
Nobody seeks his advice
after 75 years.

841
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.919
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing
to be nothing.

842
00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:17.966
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

843
00:45:18.592 --> 00:45:20.552
To be quoted just once.

844
00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:22.512
Very important to him.

845
00:45:23.013 --> 00:45:25.432
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background...

846
00:45:25.515 --> 00:45:27.225
- Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...

847
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:30.186
What are you trying to do, tell us he'd lie
just so he could be important once?

848
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.898
No. He wouldn't really lie.

849
00:45:32.981 --> 00:45:36.443
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words...

850
00:45:36.526 --> 00:45:38.737
and recognized the boy's face.

851
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.114
That's the most fantastic story
I've ever heard.

852
00:45:41.197 --> 00:45:44.242
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

853
00:45:53.293 --> 00:45:55.337
Oh, does anybody want
a cough drop?

854
00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.672
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

855
00:45:57.756 --> 00:46:01.259
You can say what you like. I still don't see
how anybody can think he's not guilty.

856
00:46:01.343 --> 00:46:03.845
There's something else
I'd like to talk about for a minute.

857
00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:05.555
Thanks.

858
00:46:05.639 --> 00:46:08.934
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say I'm gonna kill you.

859
00:46:09.017 --> 00:46:10.602
- But supposing...
- You didn't prove it at all.

860
00:46:10.685 --> 00:46:13.480
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

861
00:46:13.563 --> 00:46:15.982
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

862
00:46:16.066 --> 00:46:17.567
Probably thousands.

863
00:46:17.651 --> 00:46:19.277
I could kill you for that, darling.

864
00:46:19.361 --> 00:46:21.279
Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you.

865
00:46:21.363 --> 00:46:22.656
Get in there, Rocky, and kill him.

866
00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:24.616
We say it every clay. That doesn't mean
we're really gonna kill anybody.

867
00:46:24.699 --> 00:46:26.493
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to give us here?

868
00:46:26.576 --> 00:46:30.288
The phrase was I'm gonna kill you.
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

869
00:46:30.372 --> 00:46:31.706
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

870
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.084
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

871
00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:35.627
Well, gee, now I don't know.

872
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:40.423
I remember I was arguing with a guy
I work next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

873
00:46:40.507 --> 00:46:42.258
He called me an idiot,
so I yelled at him.

874
00:46:42.342 --> 00:46:45.303
Now listen! This guy's trying to make you
believe things that aren't so.

875
00:46:45.387 --> 00:46:47.472
The kid said he was gonna kill him,
and he did kill him.

876
00:46:47.555 --> 00:46:50.517
Let me ask you this. Do you really think
the boy would shout out a thing like that...

877
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.394
so the whole neighborhood could hear him?

878
00:46:52.477 --> 00:46:54.312
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

879
00:46:54.396 --> 00:46:59.150
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

880
00:46:59.234 --> 00:47:02.070
He doesn't even speak good English.

881
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:08.326
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to change
my vote to not guilty.

882
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:09.828
You what?

883
00:47:09.911 --> 00:47:12.330
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

884
00:47:13.248 --> 00:47:14.666
Yeah, I'm sure.

885
00:47:14.749 --> 00:47:17.210
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

886
00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:20.088
Well, if this isn't the living end.

887
00:47:24.134 --> 00:47:26.886
What are you basing it on,
the stories this guy made up?

888
00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:29.848
You ought to write for one of those
kooky detective magazines.

889
00:47:29.931 --> 00:47:31.766
You'd make a fortune.

890
00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:35.270
For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

891
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.355
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

892
00:47:37.439 --> 00:47:39.232
You could see it.

893
00:47:39.315 --> 00:47:42.902
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

894
00:47:43.737 --> 00:47:45.530
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

895
00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:48.450
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

896
00:47:48.533 --> 00:47:51.369
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please.

897
00:47:51.453 --> 00:47:53.163
He was court-appointed.

898
00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:55.081
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

899
00:47:55.165 --> 00:47:58.418
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

900
00:47:58.501 --> 00:48:00.336
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing.

901
00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.381
No money, no glory,
not even much chance of winning.

902
00:48:03.465 --> 00:48:06.384
That's not a very promising situation
for a young lawyer.

903
00:48:06.468 --> 00:48:09.387
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

904
00:48:09.471 --> 00:48:11.473
and, as you pointed out a minute ago,
obviously he didn't.

905
00:48:11.556 --> 00:48:14.392
Of course he didn't.

906
00:48:14.476 --> 00:48:16.770
Who the heck could?

907
00:48:16.853 --> 00:48:19.773
Except maybe some guy's mother
or somebody. I...

908
00:48:19.856 --> 00:48:22.108
Ah, look.
Will you look at the time, huh?

909
00:48:22.192 --> 00:48:24.736
- Come on. For crying out...
- Pardon me.

910
00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:27.155
- I have made some notes here.
- Notes.

911
00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:29.866
And I would like to,
please, to say something.

912
00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:32.202
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

913
00:48:32.285 --> 00:48:36.706
And it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

914
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:41.419
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

915
00:48:41.503 --> 00:48:45.590
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

916
00:48:45.673 --> 00:48:47.967
There is a question I would like to ask.

917
00:48:48.051 --> 00:48:51.346
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

918
00:48:51.429 --> 00:48:54.766
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12:00.

919
00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:57.310
Now, how was he caught
by the police?

920
00:48:57.393 --> 00:49:01.898
He came back home
at 3:00 or so...

921
00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:05.735
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

922
00:49:05.819 --> 00:49:10.406
Now, my question is,
if he really had killed his father...

923
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:13.701
why would he come back home
three hours later?

924
00:49:13.785 --> 00:49:16.663
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

925
00:49:16.746 --> 00:49:18.498
He came home to get his knife.

926
00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:21.126
It's not nice to go around leaving knives
sticking in people's chests.

927
00:49:21.209 --> 00:49:23.962
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

928
00:49:24.045 --> 00:49:26.297
I don't see anything funny about it.

929
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:29.926
The boy knew the knife could be identified
as the one he had just bought.

930
00:49:30.009 --> 00:49:32.178
He had to get it before the police did.

931
00:49:32.262 --> 00:49:36.724
But if he knew the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it there in the first place?

932
00:49:37.267 --> 00:49:40.145
Well, I think we can assume
the boy ran out in a state of panic...

933
00:49:40.228 --> 00:49:42.605
after having just killed his father.

934
00:49:42.689 --> 00:49:45.650
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

935
00:49:45.733 --> 00:49:48.653
This then depends
on your definition of panic.

936
00:49:48.736 --> 00:49:51.114
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

937
00:49:51.197 --> 00:49:53.783
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

938
00:49:53.867 --> 00:49:57.912
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

939
00:49:57.996 --> 00:50:00.373
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

940
00:50:00.456 --> 00:50:04.002
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

941
00:50:04.085 --> 00:50:05.879
I'm simply asking questions.

942
00:50:05.962 --> 00:50:08.965
Well, this is just off the top
of my head, but...

943
00:50:09.048 --> 00:50:11.551
well, if I were the boy and
I'd done the stabbing and everything...

944
00:50:11.634 --> 00:50:13.761
I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.

945
00:50:13.845 --> 00:50:16.347
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

946
00:50:16.431 --> 00:50:18.933
and that the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.

947
00:50:19.017 --> 00:50:21.060
Well, after all,
it was the middle of the night.

948
00:50:21.144 --> 00:50:23.646
I'll bet he'd figured nobody
would find the body till the next day.

949
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:25.732
Pardon.
This is my whole point.

950
00:50:25.815 --> 00:50:29.527
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing...

951
00:50:29.611 --> 00:50:32.197
that is, a moment
after the train went by...

952
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.283
she screamed and then
went to telephone the police.

953
00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:38.745
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream...

954
00:50:38.828 --> 00:50:42.332
so he knew
that somebody saw something.

955
00:50:42.415 --> 00:50:45.210
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

956
00:50:45.293 --> 00:50:48.046
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

957
00:50:48.129 --> 00:50:49.797
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

958
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:53.259
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

959
00:50:53.343 --> 00:50:56.387
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

960
00:50:56.471 --> 00:50:58.932
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

961
00:50:59.015 --> 00:51:01.893
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

962
00:51:01.976 --> 00:51:05.688
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

963
00:51:05.772 --> 00:51:08.399
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

964
00:51:08.483 --> 00:51:11.402
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

965
00:51:11.486 --> 00:51:14.239
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

966
00:51:14.322 --> 00:51:15.990
during the time the killing took place.

967
00:51:16.074 --> 00:51:17.825
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

968
00:51:17.909 --> 00:51:19.619
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

969
00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:21.496
He's twisting the facts,
I'm telling you.

970
00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:24.916
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

971
00:51:24.999 --> 00:51:26.918
Well, did or didn't he?

972
00:51:27.001 --> 00:51:30.213
- He says he did.
- Says he did? Boy! How do you like that?

973
00:51:30.296 --> 00:51:33.258
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

974
00:51:33.341 --> 00:51:35.593
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

975
00:51:35.677 --> 00:51:37.512
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

976
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:39.305
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

977
00:51:39.389 --> 00:51:41.099
These guys
keep going off every which way.

978
00:51:41.182 --> 00:51:43.101
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

979
00:51:43.184 --> 00:51:46.354
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

980
00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:48.940
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...

981
00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:51.401
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

982
00:51:51.484 --> 00:51:55.154
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

983
00:51:59.033 --> 00:52:01.577
I never saw so much time
spent on nothing.

984
00:52:01.661 --> 00:52:03.371
It only takes a second.

985
00:52:04.455 --> 00:52:07.875
Okay. I guess the fastest way
is to find out who's voting not guilty.

986
00:52:07.959 --> 00:52:10.712
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

987
00:52:11.963 --> 00:52:15.550
Still the same.
One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.

988
00:52:15.633 --> 00:52:17.302
So, now where are we?

989
00:52:17.385 --> 00:52:20.805
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

990
00:52:20.888 --> 00:52:23.641
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

991
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:30.106
What are ya talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.

992
00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:33.985
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

993
00:52:34.068 --> 00:52:36.321
Tell him, will ya?
Now this is getting to be a joke.

994
00:52:36.404 --> 00:52:39.615
The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

995
00:52:39.699 --> 00:52:43.369
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

996
00:52:43.453 --> 00:52:45.955
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

997
00:52:46.039 --> 00:52:50.335
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

998
00:52:50.418 --> 00:52:52.170
There is a reasonable doubt
in my mind.

999
00:52:52.253 --> 00:52:55.256
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing
but words. Here, look at this.

1000
00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:00.261
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1001
00:53:00.345 --> 00:53:02.347
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1002
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.099
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1003
00:53:05.183 --> 00:53:07.352
Oh, brilliant.

1004
00:53:07.435 --> 00:53:09.729
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.

1005
00:53:09.812 --> 00:53:11.981
I mean,
what are we supposed to believe?

1006
00:53:12.065 --> 00:53:14.901
I mean, you're sittin' here,
you're pulling stories out of thin air, you know?

1007
00:53:14.984 --> 00:53:18.696
A guy like this, if he's sitting ringside
at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1008
00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:21.240
he'd be trying to tell you that...

1009
00:53:21.324 --> 00:53:23.701
Look.
Now, what about the old man?

1010
00:53:23.785 --> 00:53:26.371
Are we supposed to believe that
he didn't get up and run to his door...

1011
00:53:26.454 --> 00:53:29.457
and see the kid tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?

1012
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.001
He's just saying so to be
important, right?

1013
00:53:32.085 --> 00:53:34.879
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?

1014
00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:37.173
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1015
00:53:37.256 --> 00:53:39.217
and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits
wherever we look.

1016
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.553
Hold it a second. Now, look...
Did the old man say he ran to the door?

1017
00:53:42.637 --> 00:53:45.598
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on,
didn't he? I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1018
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:48.226
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1019
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:51.729
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1020
00:53:51.813 --> 00:53:54.190
He said he went from his bedroom
to the front door.

1021
00:53:54.273 --> 00:53:55.900
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1022
00:53:55.983 --> 00:53:58.236
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1023
00:53:58.319 --> 00:54:00.571
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1024
00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:02.865
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1025
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:06.202
Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all
over again so you can get everything straight?

1026
00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:08.913
How come you're the only one in this room
wants to see exhibits all the time?

1027
00:54:08.996 --> 00:54:11.707
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1028
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:14.627
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...

1029
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.671
We're not,
not unless somebody else wants to.

1030
00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:18.464
But I'd like to find out if an old man...

1031
00:54:18.548 --> 00:54:20.925
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1032
00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:23.428
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

1033
00:54:23.511 --> 00:54:25.179
- He said 20 seconds.
- He said 15.

1034
00:54:25.263 --> 00:54:27.432
He said 20 seconds.
What are you trying to distort...

1035
00:54:27.515 --> 00:54:30.768
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1036
00:54:30.852 --> 00:54:32.520
You can't judge a thing like that.

1037
00:54:32.603 --> 00:54:34.981
He said 15 seconds.
He was very positive about it.

1038
00:54:35.064 --> 00:54:37.275
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1039
00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:39.652
How could he be positive about anything?

1040
00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:51.456
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

1041
00:54:51.539 --> 00:54:53.708
Well, let's see
if the details bear him out.

1042
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:56.669
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1043
00:54:56.752 --> 00:54:58.421
running toward the front door...

1044
00:54:58.504 --> 00:55:01.591
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1045
00:55:01.674 --> 00:55:03.801
He said he got to his own front door
as fast as he could...

1046
00:55:03.885 --> 00:55:05.970
and he swore it couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.

1047
00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:07.722
Now, if the killer
began running immediately...

1048
00:55:07.805 --> 00:55:10.016
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1049
00:55:10.099 --> 00:55:12.810
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1050
00:55:14.103 --> 00:55:16.230
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1051
00:55:16.314 --> 00:55:19.442
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1052
00:55:19.525 --> 00:55:21.235
Now that you've got that thing in here,
what about it?

1053
00:55:21.319 --> 00:55:23.488
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1054
00:55:23.571 --> 00:55:26.616
The old man's apartment
was directly beneath and exactly the same.

1055
00:55:26.699 --> 00:55:29.911
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1056
00:55:29.994 --> 00:55:31.996
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.

1057
00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:34.332
Now, the old man
was in this bedroom right here.

1058
00:55:34.415 --> 00:55:37.084
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1059
00:55:37.168 --> 00:55:40.129
opened the front door just in time
to see the boy running down the stairs.

1060
00:55:40.213 --> 00:55:43.549
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

1061
00:55:43.633 --> 00:55:47.178
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

1062
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:49.305
Now, let's see. It was...

1063
00:55:49.388 --> 00:55:53.392
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

1064
00:55:53.476 --> 00:55:56.687
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...

1065
00:55:56.771 --> 00:56:00.399
walk 43 feet down and open the front door
all in 15 seconds.

1066
00:56:00.483 --> 00:56:03.194
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

1067
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:05.863
He can walk only very slowly.
They had to help him into the witness chair.

1068
00:56:05.947 --> 00:56:07.615
You make it sound like a long walk.

1069
00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:10.034
For an old man who had a stroke,
it is a long walk.

1070
00:56:10.117 --> 00:56:13.538
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.

1071
00:56:13.663 --> 00:56:16.999
What do you mean, you want to try it? Why
didn't his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?

1072
00:56:17.124 --> 00:56:18.124
Maybe he just didn't think
about it, huh?

1073
00:56:18.224 --> 00:56:20.753
What do you mean, didn't think of it?
You think the man's an idiot or something?

1074
00:56:20.836 --> 00:56:22.380
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1075
00:56:22.463 --> 00:56:24.131
Listen, smart guy.
Don't matter whether I thought of it.

1076
00:56:24.215 --> 00:56:26.425
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1077
00:56:26.551 --> 00:56:30.388
Maybe he didn't bring it up 'cause it would have
meant bullying, badgering a helpless old man.

1078
00:56:30.471 --> 00:56:33.808
You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury.
Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1079
00:56:33.891 --> 00:56:36.602
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1080
00:56:36.686 --> 00:56:39.730
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

1081
00:56:39.814 --> 00:56:42.692
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.

1082
00:56:42.775 --> 00:56:45.403
Oh, that's crazy.
You can't recreate a thing like that.

1083
00:56:45.486 --> 00:56:47.697
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1084
00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:49.782
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

1085
00:56:51.075 --> 00:56:54.912
Look, this is absolutely insane. What are you
wasting everybody's time in here for?

1086
00:56:54.996 --> 00:56:57.873
According to you, it'll only take 15 seconds.
Now, we can spare that, see.

1087
00:57:01.836 --> 00:57:03.504
Come on. Knock it off.

1088
00:57:03.588 --> 00:57:05.089
Okay.

1089
00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:07.216
Okay. Okay, killer.

1090
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.884
Yeah.

1091
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.264
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1092
00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:15.850
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

1093
00:57:15.933 --> 00:57:18.102
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

1094
00:57:18.185 --> 00:57:20.605
When you want me to start, stamp your foot.
That'll be the body falling.

1095
00:57:20.688 --> 00:57:22.607
You can time me from there.

1096
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:24.775
What are we gonna do,
play charades now?

1097
00:57:24.859 --> 00:57:26.902
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

1098
00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:28.904
Well, I want to wait
till the second hand reaches 60.

1099
00:57:28.988 --> 00:57:30.906
Oh, come on.

1100
00:57:37.622 --> 00:57:40.625
Come on. Speed it up.
He could walk twice as fast as that.

1101
00:57:42.084 --> 00:57:44.545
You want me to walk faster than that,
I will.

1102
00:58:01.437 --> 00:58:03.898
Lock. Door. Stop.

1103
00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:05.983
- Right.
- What's the time?

1104
00:58:06.067 --> 00:58:09.320
Exactly 41 seconds.

1105
00:58:09.403 --> 00:58:11.656
This is what I think happened.

1106
00:58:11.739 --> 00:58:14.575
The old man heard the fight between the boy
and his father a few hours earlier.

1107
00:58:14.659 --> 00:58:17.495
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard
the body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1108
00:58:17.578 --> 00:58:21.082
heard the woman scream from across the street,
got to his front door as fast as he could...

1109
00:58:21.165 --> 00:58:23.751
heard somebody racing down the stairs
and assumed it was the boy.

1110
00:58:23.834 --> 00:58:25.670
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

1111
00:58:28.339 --> 00:58:34.303
Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty
in my day, but this little display takes the cake.

1112
00:58:34.387 --> 00:58:39.100
You all come in here with your hearts bleeding
all over the floor about slum kids and injustice.

1113
00:58:39.183 --> 00:58:41.185
You listen to some fairy tales.

1114
00:58:41.268 --> 00:58:43.562
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1115
00:58:43.646 --> 00:58:46.607
Well, you're not getting through to me.
I've had enough.

1116
00:58:46.691 --> 00:58:48.734
What's the matter with you guys?

1117
00:58:48.818 --> 00:58:51.529
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1118
00:58:51.612 --> 00:58:53.406
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

1119
00:58:53.489 --> 00:58:55.700
Slip through our fingers?
Are you his executioner?

1120
00:58:55.783 --> 00:58:57.451
I'm one of 'em!

1121
00:58:58.619 --> 00:59:00.454
Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.

1122
00:59:00.538 --> 00:59:02.540
For this kid, you bet I would.

1123
00:59:02.623 --> 00:59:05.876
I feel sorry for you. What it must feel like
to want to pull the switch.

1124
00:59:06.752 --> 00:59:10.673
Ever since you walked into this room, you've
been acting like a self-appointed public avenger.

1125
00:59:10.756 --> 00:59:15.052
You want to see this boy die because you
personally want it, not because of the facts.

1126
00:59:15.136 --> 00:59:17.304
- You're a sadist.
- You...

1127
00:59:17.388 --> 00:59:21.225
Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

1128
00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:23.728
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1129
00:59:31.026 --> 00:59:33.362
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1130
00:59:33.446 --> 00:59:37.450
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just...
You know, friendly little argument. It's...

1131
00:59:37.533 --> 00:59:40.828
Listen, we're through with that diagram.
You can take it if you want.

1132
00:59:42.204 --> 00:59:43.873
Here you are. Thank you.

1133
00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.505
What are you lookin' at?

1134
01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:14.320
I suppose somebody
has to start it off again.

1135
01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:18.115
- I beg pardon.
- I beg pardon. What are you so polite about?

1136
01:00:18.199 --> 01:00:20.284
For the same reason you're not.

1137
01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.369
It's the way I was brought up.

1138
01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.207
This fighting...

1139
01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.334
That's not why we are here, to fight.

1140
01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:30.795
We have a responsibility.

1141
01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:36.550
This, I have always thought,
is a remarkable thing about democracy...

1142
01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:38.511
that we are...

1143
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.306
What is the word?

1144
01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:45.476
Notified.
That we are notified by mail...

1145
01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:49.897
to come down to this place
to decide on the guilt or innocence...

1146
01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.026
of a man we have never heard before.

1147
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:58.656
We have nothing to gain or lose
by our verdict.

1148
01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:02.701
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

1149
01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.831
We should not make it a personal thing.

1150
01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.834
Thank you.

1151
01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:13.337
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

1152
01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.173
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

1153
01:01:16.257 --> 01:01:17.883
and see if the cat licks it up.

1154
01:01:17.967 --> 01:01:20.302
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy...

1155
01:01:24.807 --> 01:01:26.934
Look how dark it's getting out there.

1156
01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.478
I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.

1157
01:01:31.272 --> 01:01:33.732
Boy, oh, boy.
It's really hot, huh?

1158
01:01:35.234 --> 01:01:38.028
Pardon me,
but don't you ever sweat?

1159
01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:41.615
No, I don't.

1160
01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:43.701
Well, listen. I...

1161
01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:46.954
I was wondering if maybe...

1162
01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.331
maybe we should take another vote.

1163
01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:53.711
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

1164
01:01:54.394 --> 01:01:55.588
Mr. Foreman?

1165
01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.925
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

1166
01:02:00.009 --> 01:02:03.220
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1167
01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:06.807
I think we ought to have an open ballot,
call out our votes, you know.

1168
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:09.101
Let's see who stands where.

1169
01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.687
That sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

1170
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.151
Okay. I'll call off your jury numbers.
One.

1171
01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:20.946
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

1172
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:22.823
Two?

1173
01:02:22.907 --> 01:02:24.408
Not guilty.

1174
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:27.786
- Number three?
- Guilty.

1175
01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:30.331
Number four?

1176
01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:33.626
Guilty.

1177
01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:36.462
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

1178
01:02:37.546 --> 01:02:40.841
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

1179
01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:43.510
Number seven?

1180
01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:45.304
Guilty.

1181
01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.431
Number eight?

1182
01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:49.183
Not guilty.

1183
01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:53.437
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

1184
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.689
- Number ten?
- Guilty.

1185
01:02:57.483 --> 01:02:59.526
Number eleven?

1186
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:01.445
Not guilty.

1187
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.030
Number twelve?

1188
01:03:03.948 --> 01:03:06.283
Number twelve.

1189
01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:07.868
Guilty.

1190
01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:15.876
The vote is now six to six.

1191
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.129
Yeah, right.
And we go into extra innings here, huh?

1192
01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:26.053
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you people
in here must be out of your minds.

1193
01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.972
A kid like that.

1194
01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:31.308
I don't think the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it.

1195
01:03:31.392 --> 01:03:33.477
The facts are supposed to
determine the case.

1196
01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.729
Don't give me that!
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1197
01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:37.815
You can twist them any way you like.
You know what I mean?

1198
01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:40.484
That's exactly the point
this gentleman has been making.

1199
01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:43.487
I mean, you keep shouting
at the top of your lungs.

1200
01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:47.074
I'd like to be a few years younger.

1201
01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.076
That man gets on my...

1202
01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:55.290
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

1203
01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:59.086
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

1204
01:04:06.927 --> 01:04:08.721
It's gonna rain.

1205
01:04:08.804 --> 01:04:11.056
Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

1206
01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:14.184
How come you changed your vote?

1207
01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:16.687
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

1208
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.981
You haven't got a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.

1209
01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:22.067
I don't feel that way. There were
a lot of details that never came out.

1210
01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:25.696
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

1211
01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.990
You think too much.
You get mixed up.

1212
01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:33.203
- You know what I mean?
- Now, listen. I don't think you have any right...

1213
01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:35.873
Loudmouth.

1214
01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:31.095
Look at that come down, will you?

1215
01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:34.139
You know...

1216
01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:36.725
this reminds me of a storm
we had last...

1217
01:05:36.809 --> 01:05:40.270
Oh, when was that?
November...

1218
01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:43.440
I don't know. Something.
It was quite a storm we had there.

1219
01:05:43.524 --> 01:05:45.901
It was right in the middle of a game.

1220
01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.612
We were behind 7-6...

1221
01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.281
but we just started to move the ball,
right off the tackle.

1222
01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:54.159
Started cutting right,
slash here and slash right in...

1223
01:05:54.243 --> 01:05:56.036
cut right through.

1224
01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.622
And...

1225
01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.916
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1226
01:06:02.084 --> 01:06:05.462
A real... He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1227
01:06:05.546 --> 01:06:08.048
I wish I had another one just like him.

1228
01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:12.636
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head coach
at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1229
01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:14.805
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1230
01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.641
And, anyway...

1231
01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:19.810
we're starting to move along real nice.

1232
01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:23.063
Their whole line is just...
they're just coming apart.

1233
01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:28.110
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1234
01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:30.821
Just whoosh, you know, right down.

1235
01:06:32.114 --> 01:06:35.492
Well, that was murder, you know?

1236
01:06:35.576 --> 01:06:38.162
I swear, I nearly bawled.

1237
01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:40.581
You just... You couldn't go nowhere.

1238
01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:43.167
Well.

1239
01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:01.310
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1240
01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.819
Hey! Huh?

1241
01:07:10.903 --> 01:07:14.198
Must have been on the same
switch with the lights.

1242
01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:18.368
Well, things are looking up here, huh?

1243
01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:20.537
Yeah, huh?

1244
01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.377
Boy. That's better.

1245
01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.552
Hey!

1246
01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:37.304
Two points.

1247
01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:43.310
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

1248
01:07:45.604 --> 01:07:48.482
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1249
01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.734
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

1250
01:07:51.777 --> 01:07:53.153
You know?

1251
01:07:54.863 --> 01:07:56.365
Pardon me.

1252
01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:59.785
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.

1253
01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:02.246
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1254
01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:03.830
Yes.

1255
01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:09.127
Say, that business before,
when that tall guy, what's-his-name,

1256
01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:11.922
was trying to bait me...
That doesn't prove anything.

1257
01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.591
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1258
01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:18.512
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1259
01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:22.099
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1260
01:08:22.182 --> 01:08:24.476
He was just trying to bait me.

1261
01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:26.561
He did an excellent job.

1262
01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:31.566
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1263
01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:34.194
I'm ready to walk into court right now
and declare a hung jury.

1264
01:08:34.278 --> 01:08:36.113
There's no point in this thing
going on anymore.

1265
01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:37.531
Yeah. I go for that too.

1266
01:08:37.614 --> 01:08:40.450
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1267
01:08:40.534 --> 01:08:43.370
I don't think the judge will accept a hung jury.
We haven't been in here very long.

1268
01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:45.122
Well, let's find out.

1269
01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:46.915
I'm not in favor of that.

1270
01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:50.210
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1271
01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:53.130
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1272
01:08:53.213 --> 01:08:55.424
You still don't think there's room
for reasonable doubt?

1273
01:08:55.507 --> 01:08:56.800
No, I don't.

1274
01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.176
Pardon.

1275
01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.513
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term reasonable doubt.

1276
01:09:01.596 --> 01:09:04.141
What do you mean I don't understand?

1277
01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:07.185
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1278
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:08.937
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1279
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:11.857
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1280
01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.318
they're telling us
how to run the show, huh?

1281
01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:16.194
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1282
01:09:16.278 --> 01:09:20.866
Hey, all right. Let's stop
the arguing for about two minutes in here.

1283
01:09:20.949 --> 01:09:23.327
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1284
01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.955
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1285
01:09:27.039 --> 01:09:29.708
An important point for the prosecution
was the fact...

1286
01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.544
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1287
01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.629
during the hours
that the killing took place...

1288
01:09:34.713 --> 01:09:38.592
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1289
01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.178
This gentleman here has put up that point
in here several times.

1290
01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:42.721
That's correct.

1291
01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.681
It was the only alibi the boy offered...

1292
01:09:44.765 --> 01:09:47.267
and he himself couldn't back it up
with any details at all.

1293
01:09:47.351 --> 01:09:50.604
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1294
01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:54.149
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1295
01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:57.444
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

1296
01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:00.697
The boy couldn't remember names of the movies
he saw because he wasn't there that night.

1297
01:10:00.781 --> 01:10:02.824
According to the police testimony
in court...

1298
01:10:02.908 --> 01:10:06.036
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1299
01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:09.039
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1300
01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.708
Do you think you could remember details
under those circumstances?

1301
01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:13.794
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1302
01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:16.380
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1303
01:10:16.463 --> 01:10:18.423
He named the pictures
and the stars who played in them.

1304
01:10:18.507 --> 01:10:21.676
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

1305
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.304
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1306
01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:26.014
in which to memorize them.

1307
01:10:26.098 --> 01:10:28.767
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1308
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.519
on a particular night.

1309
01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:34.231
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who
interrogated the boy right after the murder...

1310
01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:36.733
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1311
01:10:36.817 --> 01:10:38.735
great emotional stress or not.

1312
01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:42.114
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1313
01:10:42.197 --> 01:10:45.450
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1314
01:10:45.534 --> 01:10:48.078
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

1315
01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.496
No, it's all right.

1316
01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:52.124
I left the office at 8:30
and went straight home and to bed.

1317
01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:53.875
And the night before that?

1318
01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:56.378
That was Tuesday night?

1319
01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.463
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1320
01:10:58.547 --> 01:10:59.881
Monday night?

1321
01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:03.176
When you get down to New Year's
Eve 1954, let me know, huh?

1322
01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.139
Monday night?

1323
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:11.393
Monday night, my wife and I went
to the movies.

1324
01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.103
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1325
01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:16.440
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1326
01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:19.151
The...

1327
01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:21.903
I'll tell you in a minute.
The...

1328
01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:26.158
Remarkable Mrs. something...

1329
01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:28.702
The...

1330
01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.455
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1331
01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:34.291
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1332
01:11:35.584 --> 01:11:37.961
Yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1333
01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.547
Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?

1334
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:44.301
Barbara...
Long, I think it was.

1335
01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:46.386
A dark, very pretty girl.

1336
01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:50.223
Ling or Long, something like that.

1337
01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:53.518
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1338
01:11:53.602 --> 01:11:58.023
It was a very inexpensive second
feature with unknown...

1339
01:11:58.106 --> 01:12:01.234
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1340
01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:06.281
No.

1341
01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:08.033
I wasn't.

1342
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:11.661
I think the point is made.

1343
01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:14.498
Big point!

1344
01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:16.750
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1345
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:20.921
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1346
01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:24.257
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1347
01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.512
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1348
01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:30.972
There goes your ball game.

1349
01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:33.475
It's only a shower.

1350
01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.727
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1351
01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:38.980
Right. Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1352
01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:44.110
Well, we're still tied up six to six.

1353
01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:46.196
Who's got a suggestion?

1354
01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.281
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1355
01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:50.825
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1356
01:12:50.909 --> 01:12:53.036
Okay with me.

1357
01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.288
There's something I'd like to say.

1358
01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:58.917
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1359
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.879
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made.

1360
01:13:02.963 --> 01:13:04.589
The downward angle of it, you know?

1361
01:13:04.673 --> 01:13:06.675
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1362
01:13:06.758 --> 01:13:08.385
They've been over it and over it.

1363
01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:10.762
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1364
01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:14.849
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.
His father was 6'2".

1365
01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:17.102
That's a difference of seven inches.

1366
01:13:17.185 --> 01:13:19.854
It's a very awkward thing to stab down
into the chest of someone...

1367
01:13:19.938 --> 01:13:21.940
who's more than half a foot
taller than you are.

1368
01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:24.150
Give me that.

1369
01:13:24.234 --> 01:13:27.028
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1370
01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:30.323
You...

1371
01:13:34.828 --> 01:13:37.539
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1372
01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:40.375
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?

1373
01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.587
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1374
01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:53.805
That's not funny.

1375
01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:59.728
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1376
01:14:00.395 --> 01:14:02.188
Right. Nobody hurt.

1377
01:14:05.650 --> 01:14:10.447
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was taller than I was.

1378
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.991
Look at the angle, down and in.

1379
01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:15.160
And this is the way it was done.

1380
01:14:15.243 --> 01:14:17.412
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1381
01:14:19.623 --> 01:14:23.043
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1382
01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.961
Can you give me that?

1383
01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.881
Boy, I hate these things.

1384
01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.633
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1385
01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:31.301
- You?
- No.

1386
01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:34.179
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1387
01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:37.057
Well, I have.
You know, on my back stoop...

1388
01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.476
the lot across the street, backyard.

1389
01:14:39.559 --> 01:14:41.978
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood where I lived.

1390
01:14:42.062 --> 01:14:45.315
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1391
01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:48.777
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1392
01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.822
See, you use too much time
switching hands.

1393
01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:57.077
Here's how, underhanded.

1394
01:14:59.788 --> 01:15:02.832
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1395
01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:05.543
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1396
01:15:05.627 --> 01:15:07.462
That's why they're made
to open like that.

1397
01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:10.173
You'd say the boy
was pretty handy with a knife?

1398
01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:13.426
You think he could have made
the kind of wound that killed his father?

1399
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:17.430
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1400
01:15:17.514 --> 01:15:19.516
I feel he'd have gone
for him underhanded.

1401
01:15:19.599 --> 01:15:22.644
How do you know? Were you
in the room when the father was killed?

1402
01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:24.729
No. Neither was anybody else.

1403
01:15:24.813 --> 01:15:28.024
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1404
01:15:28.108 --> 01:15:31.361
I don't think you can determine what type of
wound the boy might or might not have made...

1405
01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:34.072
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1406
01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:36.491
What do you think?

1407
01:15:36.574 --> 01:15:38.660
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1408
01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.578
I don't know.

1409
01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:46.793
How about you?

1410
01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:50.630
I don't know about the rest, but I'm getting
tired of this yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1411
01:15:50.714 --> 01:15:54.175
It's gettin' us nowhere.
So I guess I'll have to break it up.

1412
01:15:54.259 --> 01:15:56.803
I change my vote to not guilty.

1413
01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:00.223
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1414
01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:02.767
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1415
01:16:02.851 --> 01:16:06.813
Hey, listen. You just take care of
yourself, huh? You know?

1416
01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:10.859
He's right.
That's not an answer.

1417
01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:13.903
What kind of a man are you?

1418
01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:17.115
You have sat here and voted guilty
with everyone else...

1419
01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:21.453
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1420
01:16:21.536 --> 01:16:25.790
And now you've changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking here?

1421
01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:28.251
Now listen, buddy!

1422
01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:33.006
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1423
01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.592
- Don't you care...
- Now wait a minute!

1424
01:16:35.675 --> 01:16:39.679
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1425
01:16:39.763 --> 01:16:41.639
If you want to vote not guilty...

1426
01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:44.100
then do it because you are convinced
the man is not guilty...

1427
01:16:44.184 --> 01:16:45.977
not because you've had enough.

1428
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.646
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1429
01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:51.941
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1430
01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:54.277
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1431
01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:58.656
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1432
01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:01.951
Look, I don't have to...

1433
01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:05.163
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1434
01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:07.707
All right.
I don't think he's guilty.

1435
01:17:17.217 --> 01:17:18.843
I want another vote.

1436
01:17:18.927 --> 01:17:21.429
Okay.
There's another vote called for.

1437
01:17:21.513 --> 01:17:24.390
I guess the quickest way is a show of hands.
Anyone object?

1438
01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:27.393
Okay. All those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1439
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:33.483
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1440
01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:37.987
eight.

1441
01:17:41.908 --> 01:17:44.035
Nine.

1442
01:17:45.036 --> 01:17:50.041
All those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1443
01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:52.502
One, two, three.

1444
01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.088
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favor of acquittal.

1445
01:17:56.089 --> 01:17:58.258
I don't understand you people!

1446
01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.510
I mean, all these picky little points
you keep bringing up.

1447
01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:03.930
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1448
01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:07.517
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...

1449
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.602
and that business
about being at the movies.

1450
01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:12.689
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1451
01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.816
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1452
01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.860
They don't know what the truth is.

1453
01:18:16.943 --> 01:18:20.655
And let me tell you, they don't need
any real big reason to kill someone either.

1454
01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:22.490
No, sir.

1455
01:18:22.574 --> 01:18:25.618
They get drunk!
They're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1456
01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:28.872
You know that.
And bang, someone's lying in the gutter.

1457
01:18:28.955 --> 01:18:31.958
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1458
01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:34.127
You know what I mean? Violent!

1459
01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.712
Where are you going?

1460
01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:38.798
Human life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1461
01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:42.802
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1462
01:18:42.886 --> 01:18:44.888
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1463
01:18:44.971 --> 01:18:46.347
They don't care!

1464
01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:48.641
Oh, sure, there's some good things
about 'em too.

1465
01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:50.685
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

1466
01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:54.063
I've known a couple who were okay,
but that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1467
01:18:54.147 --> 01:18:57.901
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings.
They can do anything.

1468
01:18:57.984 --> 01:19:00.570
What's going on here?

1469
01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.697
I'm trying to tell ya...

1470
01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.782
you're making a big mistake,
you people.

1471
01:19:04.866 --> 01:19:07.869
This kid is a liar!
I know it. I know all about them.

1472
01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:11.748
Listen to me.
They're no good.

1473
01:19:11.831 --> 01:19:14.167
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1474
01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:18.671
I mean, what -
What's happening in here?

1475
01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:21.007
I'm speaking my piece,
and you...

1476
01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:23.885
Listen to me.

1477
01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:26.429
I...

1478
01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:28.973
We're...
This kid on trial here, his type...

1479
01:19:29.057 --> 01:19:31.059
Well, don't you know about them?

1480
01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:36.481
There's a danger here.

1481
01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.650
These people are dangerous.

1482
01:19:38.733 --> 01:19:41.778
They're... wild.

1483
01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.780
Listen to me.

1484
01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:46.199
- Listen.
- I have.

1485
01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.285
Now sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1486
01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:55.959
I was only trying to tell you.

1487
01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:36.749
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1488
01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:41.879
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1489
01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.842
I don't really know what the truth is.

1490
01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:48.845
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1491
01:20:50.138 --> 01:20:54.100
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1492
01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:57.186
But we're just gambling
on probabilities.

1493
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:59.230
We may be wrong.

1494
01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:01.691
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1495
01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.234
I don't know.

1496
01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:05.319
Nobody really can.

1497
01:21:05.403 --> 01:21:07.780
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1498
01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:11.367
and that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1499
01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:15.997
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1500
01:21:17.457 --> 01:21:19.834
We nine can't understand...

1501
01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.628
how you three are still so sure.

1502
01:21:23.463 --> 01:21:25.465
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1503
01:21:26.841 --> 01:21:30.344
You've made some excellent points,
but I still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1504
01:21:30.428 --> 01:21:32.138
and I have two reasons.

1505
01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:35.349
One, the evidence
given by the woman across the street...

1506
01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:38.061
who actually saw the murder committed.

1507
01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:40.730
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1508
01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:44.067
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...

1509
01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:49.781
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1510
01:21:49.864 --> 01:21:51.908
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1511
01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:53.910
That's absolutely right.

1512
01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:56.579
Let's talk about this woman
for a moment.

1513
01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:59.749
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1514
01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:03.419
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1515
01:22:03.503 --> 01:22:07.590
and see directly into the boy's room
across the street.

1516
01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:10.301
She tossed and turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.

1517
01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:14.555
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1518
01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:19.769
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1519
01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:22.563
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1520
01:22:22.647 --> 01:22:27.443
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1521
01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:32.281
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1522
01:22:33.032 --> 01:22:35.701
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1523
01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:42.750
How about you?

1524
01:22:44.377 --> 01:22:46.838
I don't know.

1525
01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:48.923
So much evidence to sift.

1526
01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:50.967
This is a pretty complicated business.

1527
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:54.846
Frankly, I don't see
how you can vote for acquittal.

1528
01:22:54.929 --> 01:22:57.265
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1529
01:22:57.348 --> 01:22:59.392
You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1530
01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:03.062
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1531
01:23:03.146 --> 01:23:05.022
- Yeah, well, maybe...
- Let's vote on it.

1532
01:23:05.106 --> 01:23:07.275
Okay.
There's another vote called for.

1533
01:23:07.358 --> 01:23:09.193
Anybody object?

1534
01:23:09.277 --> 01:23:12.321
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1535
01:23:12.405 --> 01:23:14.824
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1536
01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:18.494
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you, this one vote?

1537
01:23:18.578 --> 01:23:22.039
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1538
01:23:22.123 --> 01:23:24.834
How about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1539
01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.420
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1540
01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:31.507
Let's go over it again.

1541
01:23:31.591 --> 01:23:33.509
We've been over it again!

1542
01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:38.389
The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin'
backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.

1543
01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:42.310
No point in getting nasty
and trying to turn this into a contest.

1544
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:45.730
Okay.

1545
01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:48.858
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1546
01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.068
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

1547
01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:55.531
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1548
01:23:55.615 --> 01:23:57.575
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1549
01:23:57.658 --> 01:24:00.036
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1550
01:24:00.119 --> 01:24:03.372
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1551
01:24:03.456 --> 01:24:05.124
Don't you feel well?

1552
01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:08.419
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1553
01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:11.214
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1554
01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:14.217
The reason I asked about that
was because...

1555
01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.885
you were rubbing your nose like...

1556
01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:18.638
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1557
01:24:18.721 --> 01:24:21.933
but you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1558
01:24:22.016 --> 01:24:24.060
I'm trying to settle something here.
Do you mind?

1559
01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:26.145
Well, I think this is important.

1560
01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:29.023
Thank you.

1561
01:24:29.106 --> 01:24:31.734
Now then,
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...

1562
01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.737
but I was wondering why
you were rubbing your nose like that.

1563
01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.489
Oh, come on, will ya?

1564
01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:40.743
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1565
01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:44.080
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1566
01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:48.251
Well, if it's any of your business,
I was rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1567
01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:49.961
I'm sorry.

1568
01:24:50.044 --> 01:24:53.923
- Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1569
01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:55.758
Now can we get on to something else?

1570
01:24:55.841 --> 01:25:00.429
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

1571
01:25:00.513 --> 01:25:02.682
I hadn't noticed that before.

1572
01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:06.269
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1573
01:25:06.352 --> 01:25:08.271
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1574
01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:11.691
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1575
01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:14.318
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1576
01:25:16.237 --> 01:25:19.782
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1577
01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:23.411
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1578
01:25:24.412 --> 01:25:26.622
Holy smokes!
You know, he's right.

1579
01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:28.374
Please.

1580
01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:32.211
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1581
01:25:32.295 --> 01:25:35.131
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1582
01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:39.093
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1583
01:25:40.136 --> 01:25:42.263
in my mind.

1584
01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:44.348
She had those same marks.

1585
01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:49.520
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1586
01:25:50.563 --> 01:25:55.234
This woman was about...
about 45 years old.

1587
01:25:55.318 --> 01:25:59.280
She was making a tremendous effort
to look 35...

1588
01:25:59.363 --> 01:26:01.574
for her first public appearance.

1589
01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:04.910
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1590
01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:08.873
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1591
01:26:08.956 --> 01:26:10.624
No glasses.

1592
01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:12.376
No, women do that.

1593
01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.879
See if you can get the mental
picture of it.

1594
01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:16.797
What do you mean, no glasses?

1595
01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:19.592
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1596
01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:21.886
Now, she had those marks.
I saw 'em.

1597
01:26:21.969 --> 01:26:23.888
So what?
What do ya think that means?

1598
01:26:23.971 --> 01:26:27.183
- I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.

1599
01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:30.269
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1600
01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:33.481
I was the closest one to her. She had these...
these things on the side of her nose.

1601
01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:36.776
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1602
01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:40.738
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1603
01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:45.117
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1604
01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:51.040
No, they couldn't.

1605
01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:53.125
I didn't see any marks!

1606
01:26:54.752 --> 01:26:56.462
I did.

1607
01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:59.090
Strange, but I didn't think
about it before.

1608
01:26:59.173 --> 01:27:01.300
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1609
01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:04.303
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1610
01:27:04.387 --> 01:27:06.472
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

1611
01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:09.725
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1612
01:27:09.809 --> 01:27:11.685
Have her testify without her glasses?

1613
01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:13.231
Did you ever see a woman
who had to wear glasses

1614
01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:15.731
and didn't want to because
she thinks they spoil her looks?

1615
01:27:15.815 --> 01:27:19.318
Okay.
She had marks on her nose.

1616
01:27:19.402 --> 01:27:23.072
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1617
01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:27.326
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1618
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:31.997
But when she saw this kid killing his father,
she was in the house alone.

1619
01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:34.291
That's all.

1620
01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:38.379
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1621
01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:42.007
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1622
01:27:42.091 --> 01:27:45.094
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1623
01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:46.929
tossing and turning,
trying to fall asleep.

1624
01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.348
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1625
01:27:49.432 --> 01:27:51.892
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1626
01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:54.103
when she turned
to look casually out of the window.

1627
01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.939
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1628
01:27:57.022 --> 01:28:00.067
The lights went off a split second later.
She couldn't have had time to put them on then.

1629
01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:01.777
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1630
01:28:01.861 --> 01:28:05.948
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1631
01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:09.618
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1632
01:28:09.702 --> 01:28:12.455
How do you know what kind of glasses
she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.

1633
01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:15.166
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1634
01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:18.502
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1635
01:28:18.586 --> 01:28:24.717
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1636
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.178
You can't send someone off to die
on evidence like that.

1637
01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:29.263
Oh, don't give me that.

1638
01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:31.515
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1639
01:28:31.599 --> 01:28:34.018
- No.
- It's not possible?

1640
01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:35.728
No, it's not possible.

1641
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:40.608
Is it possible?

1642
01:28:41.734 --> 01:28:43.402
Not guilty.

1643
01:28:47.573 --> 01:28:50.242
Do you think he's guilty?

1644
01:28:50.326 --> 01:28:52.328
I think he's guilty.

1645
01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.749
Do you?

1646
01:28:59.627 --> 01:29:02.671
No. I'm convinced.

1647
01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.340
Not guilty.

1648
01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:06.217
What's the matter with you?

1649
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:08.219
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1650
01:29:08.302 --> 01:29:09.845
Eleven to one.

1651
01:29:09.929 --> 01:29:12.848
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1652
01:29:12.932 --> 01:29:15.017
The knife, the whole business!

1653
01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:18.020
Well, you said we could throw out
all the other evidence.

1654
01:29:23.776 --> 01:29:25.945
Well, what do we do now?

1655
01:29:28.948 --> 01:29:30.616
You're alone.

1656
01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.537
I don't care whether I'm alone or not!
It's my right.

1657
01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:39.875
It's your right.

1658
01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:51.428
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1659
01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:56.392
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1660
01:29:57.393 --> 01:29:59.520
We're not convinced.

1661
01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:02.398
We want to hear them again.

1662
01:30:02.481 --> 01:30:04.483
We have as much time as it takes.

1663
01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:14.618
Everything, every single thing
that took place in that courtroom.

1664
01:30:14.702 --> 01:30:16.620
But I mean everything
says he's guilty.

1665
01:30:16.704 --> 01:30:19.164
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?

1666
01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:22.918
Why don't you take that stuff
about the old man?

1667
01:30:23.002 --> 01:30:26.171
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.

1668
01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:29.508
Or this business about the knife.

1669
01:30:29.592 --> 01:30:31.594
What? 'Cause he found another one
exactly like it?

1670
01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:35.014
The old man saw him
right there on the stairs!

1671
01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:37.933
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1672
01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:41.103
Every single thing.

1673
01:30:42.521 --> 01:30:45.691
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1674
01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:49.111
You can't prove
he didn't get to the door.

1675
01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:51.614
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.

1676
01:30:51.697 --> 01:30:54.283
But you can't prove it!

1677
01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:59.830
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

1678
01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:02.958
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1679
01:31:03.042 --> 01:31:07.254
I'll bet ya $5,000
I'd remember the movies I saw.

1680
01:31:07.338 --> 01:31:09.590
I'm telling ya,
everything that's gone on...

1681
01:31:09.673 --> 01:31:13.510
has been twisted and turned!

1682
01:31:13.594 --> 01:31:15.679
This business with the glasses?

1683
01:31:15.763 --> 01:31:21.310
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!

1684
01:31:21.393 --> 01:31:25.356
And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?

1685
01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:28.692
I'm telling ya,
I've got all the facts here.

1686
01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.737
Here.

1687
01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:36.617
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.

1688
01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:45.417
Well?

1689
01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:49.713
Say something!

1690
01:31:54.843 --> 01:31:58.430
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1691
01:31:59.098 --> 01:32:01.016
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1692
01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.602
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1693
01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:11.276
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!

1694
01:32:16.115 --> 01:32:18.075
I can't keep...

1695
01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:24.415
No.

1696
01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:30.129
Not guilty.

1697
01:32:33.507 --> 01:32:35.175
Not guilty.

1698
01:32:38.178 --> 01:32:39.805
Not...

1699
01:32:50.357 --> 01:32:52.526
We're ready now.

1700
01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:47.850
Hey!

1701
01:34:52.187 --> 01:34:53.856
What's your name?

1702
01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:55.440
Davis.

1703
01:34:55.524 --> 01:34:57.442
My name's McCardle.

1704
01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:01.446
Well, so long.

1705
01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:03.031
So long.
