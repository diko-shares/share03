1
00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:04.582
Thank you very much, sir.

2
00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:06.832
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

3
00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:09.291
Shh. Shh.

4
00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:11.376
We did it, Pete. We did it.

5
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.582
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.

6
00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.083
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case...

7
00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:19.957
murder in the first degree.

8
00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:24.999
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

9
00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.832
You've listened to the testimony.

10
00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:29.837
You've had the law read to you
and interpreted as it applies in this case.

11
00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:33.916
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

12
00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:38.375
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

13
00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:43.166
If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds
as to the guilt of the accused...

14
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.166
a reasonable doubt...

15
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.041
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

16
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:49.999
Now if, however,
there's no reasonable doubt...

17
00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:53.957
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

18
00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:59.208
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

19
00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:02.666
In the event
that you find the accused guilty...

20
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.083
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

21
00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:09.375
The death sentence
is mandatory in this case.

22
00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.166
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

23
00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.208
The alternate jurors are excused.

24
00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.209
The jury will now retire.

25
00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:25.084
Try this one. See if I can get it...

26
00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:28.417
It's a muggy day.

27
00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:33.791
Hey. Oh, oh.

28
00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:47.916
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

29
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.083
This thing is...

30
00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.167
- Huh?
- ...move it.

31
00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:55.643
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

32
00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:57.667
That's it.

33
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:04.249
- You know something?
- Yeah?

34
00:05:04.334 --> 00:05:06.083
I called the weather bureau this morning.

35
00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:08.083
This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.

36
00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:09.749
Could be.

37
00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:11.749
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

38
00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:15.166
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's, uh... That one, yeah.

39
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.666
Thank you very much.

40
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.500
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

41
00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:22.416
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

42
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.749
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

43
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.458
Good morning.

44
00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:39.999
I never knew they locked the door.

45
00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:42.249
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

46
00:05:43.334 --> 00:05:45.749
I don't know.
It just never occurred to me.

47
00:05:47.376 --> 00:05:49.166
What's that for?

48
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.124
Oh, I thought we might want
to vote by ballot.

49
00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:53.874
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

50
00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:58.125
Just in case, you know.

51
00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:03.500
- Î—ow'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

52
00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:05.249
It was pretty interesting.

53
00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:07.334
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

54
00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:09.957
I mean, I've never been
on a jury before.

55
00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:12.749
No? I've sat on many juries.

56
00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:16.832
What gets me is the way
those lawyers talk and talk and talk...

57
00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:19.083
even when it's an open-and-shut case
like this one.

58
00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:20.874
Did you ever hear
so much talk about nothin'?

59
00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.832
Well, I guess they're entitled.

60
00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:25.375
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...

61
00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:30.666
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

62
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.832
It would save us a lot of time and money.

63
00:06:32.917 --> 00:06:34.458
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

64
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:37.226
- Yeah, let's get goin', huh?
- We probably all got things to do here.

65
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.352
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute
break. There's one gentleman in the bathroom.

66
00:06:40.376 --> 00:06:41.333
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?

67
00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:44.208
- Are, uh... Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.

68
00:06:44.292 --> 00:06:46.292
I, uh... Well, I guess so.

69
00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:52.500
Uh, you're in my seat.

70
00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:54.583
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

71
00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.125
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

72
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.957
What did you think of the case?

73
00:07:05.042 --> 00:07:07.083
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

74
00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:10.291
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

75
00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:13.624
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

76
00:07:13.708 --> 00:07:15.708
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

77
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.999
Boy, they can be the dullest.

78
00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:20.874
Hey.

79
00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.540
That the Woolworth Building?

80
00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:24.540
That's right.

81
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:26.208
Isn't that funny?

82
00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:28.726
You know, I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside that.

83
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.832
If you had to sort out all that junk...

84
00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.999
Like that thing with the movies.

85
00:07:33.084 --> 00:07:36.143
- Yeah. You can say that again.
- And what about that business with the knife?

86
00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:39.041
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

87
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.582
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

88
00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:44.124
Yeah, I guess so.

89
00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:46.209
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

90
00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:49.041
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

91
00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:51.333
These hot-weather colds can kill you.

92
00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:53.832
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

93
00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:57.458
I sure do. I just got over one.

94
00:07:57.541 --> 00:08:00.291
Aw, come on. Mr.
Foreman, let's go here, huh?

95
00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:01.999
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.

96
00:08:02.084 --> 00:08:04.916
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a chance
to see a paper this morning.

97
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.083
Hmm?

98
00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:08.582
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

99
00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:11.375
You got a seat on the Exchange?

100
00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:13.208
I'm a broker.

101
00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:17.666
I run a messenger service...
the Beck and Call Company.

102
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.874
The name is my wife's idea.

103
00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.582
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

104
00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:26.832
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?

105
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.832
Yeah, we can all get outta here
pretty quick, huh?

106
00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:33.633
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I happen

107
00:08:33.657 --> 00:08:35.185
to have tickets to
that ball game tonight.

108
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:37.041
Yanks and Cleveland.

109
00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.916
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

110
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.666
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

111
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.874
You know... Phoom!

112
00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.208
A real jug handle. You know?

113
00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:47.540
Phoom!

114
00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:49.957
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?
Huh? Yeah.

115
00:08:50.042 --> 00:08:51.500
Where do we sit here?

116
00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:54.666
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

117
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.166
One, two, three, four, five...
so on, around the table.

118
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.500
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

119
00:08:58.583 --> 00:08:59.666
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

120
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.791
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

121
00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:05.185
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...

122
00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:08.458
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

123
00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:10.874
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

124
00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.666
Okay. Two. You're two.

125
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.916
I beg pardon?

126
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.166
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

127
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.375
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

128
00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:24.458
I think he... he did an expert job.

129
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:27.540
A lot of drive too, you know?
Real drive.

130
00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:29.707
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.

131
00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:31.375
Uh, fellas.

132
00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:34.916
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

133
00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:38.749
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:42.500
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it?
Kid kills his father... bing, just like that.

135
00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:45.226
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

136
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.166
They let those kids
run wild up there.

137
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.957
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

138
00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:51.624
Is... Is everyone here?

139
00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:53.540
The old man is inside.

140
00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:56.249
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?

141
00:09:56.334 --> 00:09:58.334
You a Yankee fan?

142
00:09:58.376 --> 00:10:00.376
No. Baltimore.

143
00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.833
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:06.166
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

145
00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:09.166
Who have they got?

146
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.666
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

147
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.291
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

148
00:10:13.376 --> 00:10:16.416
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I... I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

149
00:10:17.209 --> 00:10:18.999
Baltimore?

150
00:10:19.084 --> 00:10:21.874
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

151
00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.916
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

152
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.500
I'm, um... You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

153
00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:30.874
Uh, we can, well, discuss it first
and, uh, then vote on it.

154
00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.624
That's, of course, uh...
That's, uh, one way.

155
00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:36.666
And, uh, well, we can
vote on it right now, and...

156
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.249
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

157
00:10:39.334 --> 00:10:42.916
Yeah, let's... Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

158
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.707
Uh-huh.

159
00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:47.874
Okay, then I think that, uh...

160
00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.832
Of course you know that we have
a first-degree murder charge here...

161
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.999
and if we vote the accused guilty...

162
00:10:53.084 --> 00:10:56.333
uh, we've got to send him
to the chair.

163
00:10:56.417 --> 00:11:00.166
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

164
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.999
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

165
00:11:02.084 --> 00:11:05.874
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

166
00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:11.666
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this
has to be 12 to nothing either way.

167
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.208
Um, that's the law.

168
00:11:13.292 --> 00:11:15.333
Okay, are we ready?

169
00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:18.416
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

170
00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:25.916
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

171
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.832
eight, nine, 10, 11.

172
00:11:29.917 --> 00:11:32.832
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

173
00:11:32.917 --> 00:11:34.917
Those voting not guilty.

174
00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.666
One. Right.

175
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.041
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

176
00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.540
Well, now we know where we are.

177
00:11:42.625 --> 00:11:46.791
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

178
00:11:47.334 --> 00:11:49.624
So, what do we do now?

179
00:11:49.708 --> 00:11:51.540
Well, I guess we talk.

180
00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:52.957
Boy, oh, boy.

181
00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:55.042
You really think he's innocent?

182
00:11:58.334 --> 00:11:59.874
I don't know.

183
00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.832
I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.

184
00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:05.041
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

185
00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:06.749
He's 18 years old.

186
00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:08.916
Well, that's old enough. Î—e...

187
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.666
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

188
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.999
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

189
00:12:14.084 --> 00:12:16.624
Would you like me to list them for you?

190
00:12:16.708 --> 00:12:17.999
No.

191
00:12:18.084 --> 00:12:20.166
Then what do you want?

192
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.166
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

193
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.582
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

194
00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:26.916
No one had to think about it twice
except you.

195
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.208
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

196
00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:32.999
I don't know whether I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.

197
00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:34.666
So how come you vote not guilty?

198
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.666
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.

199
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.500
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

200
00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:41.666
without talking about it first.

201
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.166
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

202
00:12:45.459 --> 00:12:47.624
What, just because I voted fast?

203
00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:50.124
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

204
00:12:50.209 --> 00:12:52.999
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked for a hundred years.

205
00:12:53.084 --> 00:12:55.165
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...

206
00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:57.916
We're talking about somebody's life here.

207
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.143
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

208
00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:01.582
"Supposing we're wrong."

209
00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:03.726
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

210
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.750
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

211
00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:08.333
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

212
00:13:08.417 --> 00:13:10.999
Suppose we do it in five minutes.
So what?

213
00:13:11.084 --> 00:13:13.208
Let's take an hour.

214
00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.292
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

215
00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:19.917
Hmm?

216
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.083
Who's got something to say?

217
00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:24.582
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

218
00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:27.375
Great. I heard
a pretty good story last night.

219
00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:29.540
That's not why we're sitting here.

220
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.791
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

221
00:13:35.042 --> 00:13:37.042
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

222
00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:41.333
Look, this kid's been kicked around
all of his life...

223
00:13:41.417 --> 00:13:45.333
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

224
00:13:45.417 --> 00:13:47.684
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...

225
00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:50.624
his father was serving a jail term
for forgery.

226
00:13:50.708 --> 00:13:53.041
It's not a very happy beginning.

227
00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:55.249
He's a... a wild, angry kid.

228
00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.041
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

229
00:13:57.125 --> 00:14:00.832
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

230
00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:03.124
He's had a...
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

231
00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:06.166
I... I just think we owe him a few words.
That's all.

232
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.791
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

233
00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:12.957
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

234
00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:16.124
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- You know it.

235
00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:18.540
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

236
00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:20.500
We heard the facts, didn't we?

237
00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:24.375
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

238
00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:26.832
Listen, I've lived among them
all my life.

239
00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:30.249
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

240
00:14:30.334 --> 00:14:32.166
I mean, they're born liars.

241
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.582
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...

242
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.500
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

243
00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:41.166
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

244
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.393
- Come on. This isn't Sunday.
- We don't need a sermon.

245
00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:45.666
- Come on.
- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.

246
00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:49.749
Rice Pops.
It's a product I work on at the agency.

247
00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:53.208
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."

248
00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:54.916
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

249
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.166
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

250
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.957
Oh, I'm sorry.

251
00:14:59.042 --> 00:15:01.500
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

252
00:15:01.583 --> 00:15:03.291
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

253
00:15:03.376 --> 00:15:05.083
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

254
00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:07.375
Okay. Um...

255
00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:11.249
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...

256
00:15:11.334 --> 00:15:14.624
Well, perhaps you could tell us why.
You know, let us know what you're thinking.

257
00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:17.083
And we might be able to show you
where you're mixed up.

258
00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.832
Well, look, maybe...
Maybe this is an idea.

259
00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:21.333
Now, I haven't given it much thought,
but it seems to me...

260
00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:23.504
that it's up to the
group of us to convince

261
00:15:23.528 --> 00:15:25.832
this gentleman that he's
wrong and we're right.

262
00:15:25.917 --> 00:15:28.458
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to...

263
00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:31.291
Well, it was just a quick idea.

264
00:15:31.376 --> 00:15:32.832
No, no, no. That's a good one.

265
00:15:32.917 --> 00:15:35.999
Uh, suppose we go
once around the table.

266
00:15:36.084 --> 00:15:38.957
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

267
00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:41.042
Well, uh...

268
00:15:41.917 --> 00:15:44.333
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.

269
00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:47.376
I just think he's guilty.

270
00:15:47.459 --> 00:15:49.957
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go."

271
00:15:50.042 --> 00:15:51.540
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

272
00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:53.166
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

273
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.500
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

274
00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:58.041
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

275
00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:01.249
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

276
00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:03.334
Uh, what I meant was, is...

277
00:16:05.084 --> 00:16:07.084
Well, I just think he's guilty.

278
00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:08.874
I... I mean, somebody saw him do it.

279
00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:13.999
Okay. Uh, here's what I think,
and I have no personal feelings about this.

280
00:16:14.084 --> 00:16:16.249
I just want to talk about facts.

281
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.375
Number one.

282
00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:24.041
The old man lived downstairs under the room
where the killing took place.

283
00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:26.310
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

284
00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:29.999
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

285
00:16:30.084 --> 00:16:32.957
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya."

286
00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:35.333
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

287
00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:37.124
Ran to the door, opened it up...

288
00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:39.624
saw the kid running down the stairs
and out of the house.

289
00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:40.999
Called the police.

290
00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:43.749
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.

291
00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:47.083
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.

292
00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:50.249
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

293
00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:52.500
The kid is guilty.

294
00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:54.583
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.

295
00:16:54.667 --> 00:16:58.540
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

296
00:16:58.625 --> 00:17:00.083
I'm with you.

297
00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:02.707
Okay. Are you finished?

298
00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:04.249
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

299
00:17:04.334 --> 00:17:07.540
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

300
00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.893
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

301
00:17:09.917 --> 00:17:12.517
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

302
00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:14.375
- or who played in them.
- That's right.

303
00:17:14.459 --> 00:17:16.749
And no one saw him going in
or out of the theater.

304
00:17:16.833 --> 00:17:18.458
Listen, what about the woman
across the street?

305
00:17:18.541 --> 00:17:20.832
If her testimony don't prove it,
nothing does.

306
00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:23.249
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

307
00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:25.749
- Now, fellas, please.
- Let's go in order here, huh?

308
00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:29.083
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

309
00:17:29.167 --> 00:17:31.624
Here's a woman who was lying in bed.
She can't sleep.

310
00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:33.624
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

311
00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:35.540
Anyway, she looks out the window...

312
00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:39.208
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

313
00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:42.166
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

314
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.124
Everything fits.

315
00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:46.041
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

316
00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:48.310
His window is right opposite hers
across the El tracks...

317
00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:49.999
and she swore she saw him do it.

318
00:17:50.084 --> 00:17:52.749
- Through the windows of the passing El train.
- Right.

319
00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:56.999
This El train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.

320
00:17:57.084 --> 00:17:59.999
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

321
00:18:00.084 --> 00:18:02.559
you can look through the windows
of an El train when the lights are out...

322
00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:04.916
and see what's happening
on the other side.

323
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.832
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

324
00:18:07.917 --> 00:18:10.597
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

325
00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:12.667
She's one of them too, isn't she?

326
00:18:15.084 --> 00:18:17.084
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?

327
00:18:17.167 --> 00:18:18.582
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

328
00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:20.874
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

329
00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:23.500
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

330
00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:26.832
- Okay, now come on.
- Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.

331
00:18:26.917 --> 00:18:28.166
Whose turn is it next?

332
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.083
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

333
00:18:33.334 --> 00:18:36.083
Okay, may I... Can I pass? It...

334
00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.916
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

335
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.124
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

336
00:18:42.209 --> 00:18:44.874
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

337
00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:49.166
I started to be convinced, you know,
very early in the case.

338
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.874
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

339
00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:58.166
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

340
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.333
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

341
00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:04.458
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment...

342
00:19:04.541 --> 00:19:06.791
that was very powerful.

343
00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:09.666
Didn't they say something about a...
a fight and an argument...

344
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.166
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

345
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.707
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I...
- It was 8:00.

346
00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:18.832
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

347
00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:20.666
They couldn't hear what it was about.

348
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.750
Then they heard
the father hit the boy twice.

349
00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:25.749
Finally they saw the boy
run angrily out of the house.

350
00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:27.416
What does that prove?

351
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.166
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

352
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.226
Well, you said it provided a motive.
The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

353
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.500
I don't think
that was a very strong motive.

354
00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:40.166
This boy's been hit so many times in his
life that violence is practically a...

355
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.624
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

356
00:19:42.708 --> 00:19:46.916
I just... I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

357
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.582
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

358
00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.208
Anything else?

359
00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:57.749
- No.
- Okay.

360
00:19:57.833 --> 00:19:59.833
Uh, how about you?

361
00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:03.417
I don't know. It's all been said.

362
00:20:04.917 --> 00:20:07.540
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

363
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.707
This kid is five for 0.

364
00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:13.666
Well, look at his record.

365
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.957
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

366
00:20:16.042 --> 00:20:17.832
He threw a rock at a teacher.

367
00:20:17.917 --> 00:20:20.208
When he was 15, he was in reform school.

368
00:20:20.292 --> 00:20:22.124
He stole a car.

369
00:20:22.209 --> 00:20:24.707
He's been arrested for mugging.

370
00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:26.792
He was picked up twice for knife fighting.

371
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:28.957
Oh, yeah, they say
he's real handy with a knife.

372
00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:31.832
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

373
00:20:31.917 --> 00:20:34.916
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

374
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.416
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

375
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.999
A kid like that?

376
00:20:39.084 --> 00:20:42.249
It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.

377
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.916
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir."

378
00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:49.957
That's right. "Sir."

379
00:20:50.042 --> 00:20:52.060
Do you ever hear a kid
call his father that any more?

380
00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.582
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

381
00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:57.416
- You got any kids?
- Three.

382
00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:00.792
I got one.

383
00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:03.625
Twenty-two years old.

384
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.249
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

385
00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:17.124
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

386
00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:23.416
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying."

387
00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:27.917
Well, I made a man out of him.

388
00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:30.999
When he was 16, we had a fight.

389
00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.957
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

390
00:21:38.376 --> 00:21:40.458
Haven't seen him for two years.

391
00:21:42.376 --> 00:21:44.666
Kids.

392
00:21:46.376 --> 00:21:48.376
Work your heart out.

393
00:21:50.917 --> 00:21:52.166
Well, let's get going.

394
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.582
I think we're missing the point here.

395
00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:58.083
This boy, let's say he's the product
of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

396
00:21:58.167 --> 00:22:01.749
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

397
00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:04.749
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

398
00:22:04.833 --> 00:22:07.540
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

399
00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:09.500
I know it, and so do you.

400
00:22:09.583 --> 00:22:14.291
It's no secret children from slum backgrounds
are potential menaces to society.

401
00:22:14.376 --> 00:22:16.540
- Now I think...
- Brother, you can say that again.

402
00:22:16.625 --> 00:22:19.166
The kids who crawl out of these places
are real trash.

403
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.745
I don't want any part
of them. I'm telling you.

404
00:22:20.769 --> 00:22:21.559
Listen, mister. Listen.

405
00:22:21.583 --> 00:22:25.291
- I, uh... I've lived in a slum all my life.
- Wait a minute.

406
00:22:25.376 --> 00:22:28.791
Please, I... I played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.

407
00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:30.916
I mean, maybe you can still
smell it on me.

408
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.333
Now, listen, sonny.

409
00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:33.999
- Come on now.
- There's nothing personal about this.

410
00:22:34.084 --> 00:22:36.684
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

411
00:22:36.708 --> 00:22:38.791
Let's not be so sensitive.

412
00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:40.707
This sensitivity I can understand.

413
00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:45.416
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...

414
00:22:46.583 --> 00:22:48.707
Look, your turn down there.
Let's go.

415
00:22:50.042 --> 00:22:52.934
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

416
00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:54.707
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

417
00:22:54.792 --> 00:22:57.060
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

418
00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:59.476
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

419
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.208
Oh, now wait a minute.
We decided to do this a certain way.

420
00:23:02.292 --> 00:23:03.916
I think we ought to stick to that way.

421
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

422
00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:08.143
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

423
00:23:08.167 --> 00:23:10.167
K-I-D. Kid.

424
00:23:12.376 --> 00:23:16.041
What? Listen, just because I'm trying
to keep this thing organized?

425
00:23:16.125 --> 00:23:18.249
Here, you take it.
You take on the responsibility.

426
00:23:18.334 --> 00:23:20.208
I'll just... I'll keep my mouth shut.
That's all.

427
00:23:20.292 --> 00:23:22.352
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

428
00:23:22.376 --> 00:23:23.707
Don't tell me to calm down.

429
00:23:23.792 --> 00:23:25.976
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

430
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.517
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

431
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:30.559
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.

432
00:23:30.583 --> 00:23:32.166
The whole thing's unimportant.
Come on.

433
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.375
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

434
00:23:35.459 --> 00:23:37.208
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

435
00:23:37.292 --> 00:23:40.124
Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.

436
00:23:40.209 --> 00:23:42.209
You stay in there and pitch. You know?

437
00:23:43.042 --> 00:23:45.249
All right. Let's hear from somebody.

438
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.832
Well, if you want me to tell you how I
feel about it, it's all right with me.

439
00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:53.041
Boy, I don't care what you do.

440
00:23:53.125 --> 00:23:55.999
All right, I don't have anything brilliant.

441
00:23:56.084 --> 00:23:58.208
I only know as much as you do.

442
00:23:58.292 --> 00:24:02.041
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

443
00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:06.291
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

444
00:24:06.917 --> 00:24:08.624
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?

445
00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:11.166
I... I began to get a peculiar feeling
about this trial.

446
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.333
I mean, nothing is that positive.

447
00:24:13.417 --> 00:24:15.540
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

448
00:24:15.625 --> 00:24:18.333
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...

449
00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:20.435
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

450
00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.957
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

451
00:24:23.042 --> 00:24:26.416
I mean, he... he let too many things go by,
little things that...

452
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.249
What little things? Listen,
when these fellas don't ask questions...

453
00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:31.893
it's because they know the answers already
and they figure they'll be hurt.

454
00:24:31.917 --> 00:24:35.832
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

455
00:24:35.917 --> 00:24:37.208
I mean it's possible.

456
00:24:37.292 --> 00:24:39.292
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

457
00:24:42.042 --> 00:24:44.749
I... I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

458
00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:48.707
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.

459
00:24:48.792 --> 00:24:51.333
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...

460
00:24:51.417 --> 00:24:56.208
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

461
00:24:56.292 --> 00:25:00.249
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness
to this killing.

462
00:25:00.792 --> 00:25:04.166
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

463
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.375
And there was a lot
of circumstantial evidence.

464
00:25:06.459 --> 00:25:09.957
But actually, those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.

465
00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:11.832
Supposing they're wrong.

466
00:25:11.917 --> 00:25:13.707
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

467
00:25:13.792 --> 00:25:15.666
What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

468
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.375
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

469
00:25:18.459 --> 00:25:19.999
Those people sat on the stand under oath.

470
00:25:20.084 --> 00:25:21.624
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

471
00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:23.708
Could they be wrong?

472
00:25:24.209 --> 00:25:27.124
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

473
00:25:27.209 --> 00:25:29.041
Oh, come on.
Nobody can know a thing like that.

474
00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:30.832
This isn't an exact science.

475
00:25:30.917 --> 00:25:32.917
That's right. It isn't.

476
00:25:37.417 --> 00:25:40.166
Okay, let... Let's get to the point.

477
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.832
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?

478
00:25:42.917 --> 00:25:45.393
Uh, wait-wait a minute.
There's some people who haven't talked yet.

479
00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:47.476
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

480
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.832
Be quiet a second, will you?

481
00:25:49.917 --> 00:25:51.208
What about it, this...

482
00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:54.749
the knife this fine upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

483
00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:56.166
Let's talk about it.

484
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.559
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

485
00:25:58.583 --> 00:26:00.333
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

486
00:26:00.417 --> 00:26:03.500
- We all saw what it looks like.
- Why do we have to see it again?

487
00:26:03.583 --> 00:26:05.704
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

488
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.208
Say, could you bring us the knife?

489
00:26:09.292 --> 00:26:11.292
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

490
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.999
The knife and the way it was bought
is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

491
00:26:16.084 --> 00:26:17.749
- I do.
- Good.

492
00:26:17.833 --> 00:26:20.333
Now, suppose we take these facts
one at a time.

493
00:26:20.417 --> 00:26:23.666
One. The boy admitted going out of the house
at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

494
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.666
after being slapped several times
by his father.

495
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:28.500
No, no. No, he didn't say "slapped."
He said "punched."

496
00:26:28.583 --> 00:26:30.999
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.

497
00:26:31.084 --> 00:26:33.666
After being hit several times
by his father.

498
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.999
Two. He went directly
to a neighborhood junk shop...

499
00:26:36.084 --> 00:26:38.208
...where he bought one of those...
- Switch knives.

500
00:26:38.292 --> 00:26:40.292
Switchblade knives.

501
00:26:40.376 --> 00:26:42.166
This wasn't what you'd call
an ordinary knife.

502
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.749
It had a very unusual carved handle
and blade.

503
00:26:44.833 --> 00:26:46.333
The storekeeper who sold it to him...

504
00:26:46.417 --> 00:26:49.540
said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock.

505
00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:53.375
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

506
00:26:53.459 --> 00:26:54.957
Am I right so far?

507
00:26:55.042 --> 00:26:57.166
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

508
00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.416
He talked with his friends for about
an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

509
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.458
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

510
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:05.333
Four.

511
00:27:05.417 --> 00:27:07.832
They identified the death weapon
in court...

512
00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:10.416
as that very same knife.

513
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.291
Five. Î—e arrived home at about 10:00.

514
00:27:13.376 --> 00:27:15.768
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

515
00:27:15.792 --> 00:27:17.707
begin to diverge slightly.

516
00:27:17.792 --> 00:27:20.375
He claims that he went to a movie
at about 11:30...

517
00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:24.500
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

518
00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:26.684
He also claims that
the two detectives who arrested him...

519
00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:28.999
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

520
00:27:29.084 --> 00:27:30.916
Now, what happened to the switch knife?

521
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.684
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...

522
00:27:33.708 --> 00:27:38.375
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

523
00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:40.459
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

524
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.999
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

525
00:27:44.084 --> 00:27:46.084
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

526
00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:47.624
No one at the theater identified him.

527
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:50.029
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.

528
00:27:52.875 --> 00:27:54.582
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

529
00:27:54.667 --> 00:27:57.874
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father...

530
00:27:57.958 --> 00:28:01.666
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

531
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.500
He even remembered to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints.

532
00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:07.208
Now are you trying to tell me
that this knife...

533
00:28:07.292 --> 00:28:09.208
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...

534
00:28:09.292 --> 00:28:11.726
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...

535
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.416
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

536
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.559
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...

537
00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:18.851
and that somebody else stabbed his father
with a similar knife.

538
00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:20.083
It's just possible.

539
00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:22.167
Take a look at this knife.

540
00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:25.874
It's a very unusual knife.

541
00:28:25.958 --> 00:28:27.500
I've never seen one like it.

542
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:30.375
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

543
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:33.416
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

544
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.832
I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.

545
00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:37.917
And I say it's not possible.

546
00:28:44.042 --> 00:28:45.749
Where did that come from?

547
00:28:45.833 --> 00:28:47.208
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

548
00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:48.791
What do you think you're doing?

549
00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:50.500
Where did you get it?

550
00:28:50.583 --> 00:28:52.832
I went out walking
for a couple of hours last night.

551
00:28:52.917 --> 00:28:54.917
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.

552
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.999
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

553
00:28:58.084 --> 00:28:59.540
It cost six dollars.

554
00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:02.749
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.

555
00:29:02.833 --> 00:29:05.083
That's right. I broke the law.

556
00:29:05.167 --> 00:29:09.166
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

557
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.333
Maybe there are 10 knives like that.
So what?

558
00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:14.208
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

559
00:29:14.292 --> 00:29:17.612
You found another knife like it. What's that,
the discovery of the age or something?

560
00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:20.060
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

561
00:29:20.084 --> 00:29:21.874
with exactly the same kind of knife?

562
00:29:21.958 --> 00:29:23.208
The odds are a million-to-one.

563
00:29:23.292 --> 00:29:25.999
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

564
00:29:27.209 --> 00:29:29.209
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

565
00:29:29.292 --> 00:29:31.453
There's no point in standing around
all over the place.

566
00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:36.375
You know, it's interesting that he'd find a
knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

567
00:29:36.459 --> 00:29:39.208
What's interesting about it?
"Interesting."

568
00:29:39.292 --> 00:29:41.166
Well, I don't know.
I just thought it was interesting.

569
00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.041
There are still 11 of us here
who think he's guilty.

570
00:29:43.125 --> 00:29:45.416
- Right.
- What do you think you're gonna accomplish?

571
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.333
You're not gonna change anybody's mind.

572
00:29:47.417 --> 00:29:49.791
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

573
00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:52.916
The kid will be tried again
and found guilty sure as he's born.

574
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.333
That's probably right.

575
00:29:56.417 --> 00:29:59.624
So what are you gonna do?
You know, we could be here all night.

576
00:29:59.708 --> 00:30:02.957
It's only one night. A boy may die.

577
00:30:03.042 --> 00:30:05.582
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

578
00:30:05.667 --> 00:30:08.148
Someone send for Potsy the policeman
and get a pinochle deck...

579
00:30:08.209 --> 00:30:10.707
and, uh, we'll just
sweat the whole thing out right here.

580
00:30:12.209 --> 00:30:15.310
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

581
00:30:15.334 --> 00:30:18.999
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

582
00:30:19.084 --> 00:30:21.999
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

583
00:30:22.084 --> 00:30:24.874
You guys can talk the ears right off my head.
You know what I mean?

584
00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:27.666
I got three garages of mine goin' to pot
while you're talking.

585
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.416
So let's get done and get outta here.

586
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.916
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day...

587
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.481
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

588
00:30:35.541 --> 00:30:36.999
Hey, let's hold it down.

589
00:30:37.084 --> 00:30:39.416
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

590
00:30:42.292 --> 00:30:43.666
Well, what about it?

591
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.750
You're the only one.

592
00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:55.208
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

593
00:30:56.292 --> 00:30:58.292
I'm gonna call for another vote.

594
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:04.707
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

595
00:31:04.792 --> 00:31:06.832
I'll abstain.

596
00:31:06.917 --> 00:31:09.707
If there are 11 votes for guilty,
I won't stand alone.

597
00:31:09.792 --> 00:31:13.582
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

598
00:31:15.042 --> 00:31:18.749
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

599
00:31:22.084 --> 00:31:24.999
Well, that's it.
If you want to try it, I'm ready.

600
00:31:25.084 --> 00:31:26.540
All right. Let's do it the hard way.

601
00:31:26.625 --> 00:31:28.540
Okay, that sounds fair.
Everyone agreed?

602
00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:30.707
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

603
00:31:30.792 --> 00:31:31.832
Here, pass these along.

604
00:31:31.917 --> 00:31:33.917
Is that the right time?

605
00:32:05.708 --> 00:32:13.700
"Guilty."

606
00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:38.208
"Not guilty."

607
00:32:38.292 --> 00:32:39.707
"Guilty."

608
00:32:39.792 --> 00:32:41.458
Boy, how do you like that?

609
00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:43.999
Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.

610
00:32:44.084 --> 00:32:46.832
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

611
00:32:46.917 --> 00:32:49.166
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.

612
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.791
We all agreed on that, no?

613
00:32:50.875 --> 00:32:52.999
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret...

614
00:32:53.084 --> 00:32:54.957
Secret? What do you mean secret?

615
00:32:55.042 --> 00:32:58.249
There are no secrets in a jury room.
I know who it was.

616
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.916
Brother, you really are something.

617
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

618
00:33:03.084 --> 00:33:06.375
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

619
00:33:06.459 --> 00:33:09.749
about some underprivileged kid
just couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

620
00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:11.333
and you change your vote.

621
00:33:11.417 --> 00:33:13.540
If that isn't the most sick...

622
00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:17.291
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

623
00:33:17.376 --> 00:33:19.376
Oh, now just wait a minute.

624
00:33:19.417 --> 00:33:20.999
Listen, you can't talk to me like that.

625
00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:22.916
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

626
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.333
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?

627
00:33:25.417 --> 00:33:27.436
It doesn't matter. He's
very excitable. Sit down.

628
00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.874
Excitable? You
bet I'm excitable!

629
00:33:28.958 --> 00:33:31.791
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

630
00:33:31.875 --> 00:33:34.540
Someone starts telling us fairy tales,
and we're listenin'!

631
00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:36.375
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

632
00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:38.375
What made you change your vote?

633
00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:40.083
He didn't change his vote.

634
00:33:40.167 --> 00:33:41.333
I did.

635
00:33:41.417 --> 00:33:43.417
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

636
00:33:43.459 --> 00:33:45.459
Would you like me to tell you why?

637
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.375
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

638
00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:49.999
I'd like to make it clear anyway,
if you don't mind.

639
00:33:50.084 --> 00:33:51.582
Do we have to listen to this?

640
00:33:51.667 --> 00:33:53.416
The man wants to talk.

641
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.083
Thank you.

642
00:33:55.167 --> 00:33:58.500
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

643
00:33:58.583 --> 00:34:00.832
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

644
00:34:00.917 --> 00:34:02.917
He just isn't sure.

645
00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:05.791
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

646
00:34:05.875 --> 00:34:08.999
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

647
00:34:09.084 --> 00:34:10.791
I respect his motives.

648
00:34:10.875 --> 00:34:15.416
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but, uh, I want to hear more.

649
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.291
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

650
00:34:17.376 --> 00:34:19.624
I'm talking here!
You have no right to leave this room!

651
00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:21.582
He can't hear you. He never will.

652
00:34:21.667 --> 00:34:23.667
Let's sit down.

653
00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:29.624
Shall we continue?

654
00:34:29.708 --> 00:34:31.916
Well, I... I think we ought
to take a break.

655
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.124
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.

656
00:34:36.209 --> 00:34:39.166
Okay.

657
00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:41.250
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

658
00:34:42.376 --> 00:34:44.736
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

659
00:34:46.792 --> 00:34:49.249
I wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.

660
00:34:52.376 --> 00:34:55.832
You know, in advertising...
I told you I worked in an agency.

661
00:34:55.917 --> 00:34:56.916
Mm-hmm.

662
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.060
Well, there's some pretty strange people
working there.

663
00:34:59.084 --> 00:35:01.166
Well, they're not strange really, I guess.

664
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.874
It's just that they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

665
00:35:03.958 --> 00:35:05.208
You know what I mean.

666
00:35:05.292 --> 00:35:07.692
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

667
00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.749
What do you do?

668
00:35:09.833 --> 00:35:11.999
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

669
00:35:12.084 --> 00:35:15.291
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

670
00:35:15.376 --> 00:35:18.435
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an
agency, when we reach a point like this...

671
00:35:18.459 --> 00:35:21.979
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

672
00:35:22.042 --> 00:35:24.666
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

673
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.750
And it kills me.

674
00:35:26.792 --> 00:35:28.291
It's the weirdest thing in the world...

675
00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:31.707
the way they sometimes precede their idea
with a little phrase, see, like...

676
00:35:31.792 --> 00:35:34.707
Some account exec will get up,
and he'll say, uh...

677
00:35:34.792 --> 00:35:36.624
"Okay, here's an idea.

678
00:35:36.708 --> 00:35:40.333
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it."

679
00:35:40.417 --> 00:35:43.540
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny, huh?

680
00:35:43.625 --> 00:35:48.124
I, uh
- I got a little excited back there. I...

681
00:35:49.125 --> 00:35:51.125
didn't mean to get nasty.

682
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.540
I'm glad you're not one of those
lets these emotional appeals influence him.

683
00:35:56.708 --> 00:35:58.957
Uh...

684
00:36:12.209 --> 00:36:15.209
I don't know what's the matter with that fan.
Can't seem to get it to start.

685
00:36:16.292 --> 00:36:18.832
â™ª Be, be, be â™ª

686
00:36:18.917 --> 00:36:20.999
â™ª Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum â™ªâ™ª

687
00:36:21.583 --> 00:36:23.583
Eh!

688
00:36:24.625 --> 00:36:26.832
Hey, you a salesman?

689
00:36:26.917 --> 00:36:28.917
I'm an architect.

690
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.582
Hmm.

691
00:36:30.667 --> 00:36:32.916
You know what the soft sell is?

692
00:36:35.833 --> 00:36:37.833
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

693
00:36:39.417 --> 00:36:41.417
I got a different technique.

694
00:36:41.917 --> 00:36:43.707
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

695
00:36:43.792 --> 00:36:46.041
Tricks. You know?

696
00:36:46.875 --> 00:36:48.875
Yeah.

697
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:51.749
"Hit 'em where they live."
That's my motto.

698
00:36:53.167 --> 00:36:55.916
I made 27 grand last year
sellin' marmalade.

699
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.249
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.

700
00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:04.459
Hey, what are you
gettin' outta this... kicks?

701
00:37:06.417 --> 00:37:09.060
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?

702
00:37:09.084 --> 00:37:11.084
Maybe.

703
00:37:11.792 --> 00:37:14.333
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

704
00:37:14.417 --> 00:37:17.083
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

705
00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:22.167
But what are you wasting our time for?

706
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:26.791
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

707
00:37:30.084 --> 00:37:32.333
This kid is guilty, pal.

708
00:37:32.417 --> 00:37:34.832
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

709
00:37:34.917 --> 00:37:37.166
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

710
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:40.166
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

711
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.930
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?

712
00:37:43.583 --> 00:37:46.500
Oh, no difference, pal.

713
00:37:46.583 --> 00:37:48.583
No difference at all.

714
00:38:00.292 --> 00:38:02.166
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

715
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.540
Oh, they're about the same
as anyone else.

716
00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:07.416
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.

717
00:38:08.417 --> 00:38:10.458
You think we'll be much longer?

718
00:38:10.541 --> 00:38:12.166
I don't know.

719
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.166
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

720
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.791
Not a doubt in the whole world.

721
00:38:15.875 --> 00:38:18.416
We should...
Should've been done already.

722
00:38:20.667 --> 00:38:21.916
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

723
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.416
Hmm. Beats workin'.

724
00:38:28.084 --> 00:38:30.084
Uh...

725
00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:33.707
You think he's not guilty, huh?

726
00:38:33.792 --> 00:38:35.792
I don't know. It's possible.

727
00:38:36.376 --> 00:38:40.166
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

728
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:42.666
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

729
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.916
Supposing you were the one
who was on trial.

730
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.624
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

731
00:38:47.708 --> 00:38:52.208
I'm just a workingman.
My boss does the supposing. But...

732
00:38:52.292 --> 00:38:54.292
Well, I'll try one.

733
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.666
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

734
00:39:09.583 --> 00:39:10.874
Are you ready?

735
00:39:10.958 --> 00:39:12.166
Hup.

736
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.166
That one.

737
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.250
Sorry, blue eyes.

738
00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:19.249
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

739
00:39:19.334 --> 00:39:21.249
Looks like we'll be here
for dinner, huh?

740
00:39:21.334 --> 00:39:23.707
Okay, now let's...
Let's get down to business.

741
00:39:23.792 --> 00:39:25.166
Now, who wants to start it off?

742
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.666
- I would.
- Okay, go.

743
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.832
You down there.

744
00:39:28.917 --> 00:39:32.791
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."

745
00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:35.500
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.

746
00:39:35.583 --> 00:39:39.458
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

747
00:39:39.541 --> 00:39:40.916
What does that mean to you?

748
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.657
I was wondering how
clearly the old man could

749
00:39:42.681 --> 00:39:44.435
have heard the boy's
voice through the ceiling.

750
00:39:44.459 --> 00:39:46.559
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

751
00:39:46.583 --> 00:39:48.416
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

752
00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.832
Well, it was another apartment.

753
00:39:49.917 --> 00:39:52.559
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.

754
00:39:52.583 --> 00:39:54.166
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

755
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.707
And don't forget the lady
across the street.

756
00:39:55.792 --> 00:39:58.582
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

757
00:39:58.667 --> 00:40:01.124
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

758
00:40:01.209 --> 00:40:03.209
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

759
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.083
It's like talking into a dead phone.

760
00:40:05.167 --> 00:40:08.333
She said she saw the killing through the
windows of a moving elevated train.

761
00:40:08.417 --> 00:40:11.916
There were six cars on the train.
She saw the killing through the last two cars.

762
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.832
She remembered
the most insignificant details.

763
00:40:13.917 --> 00:40:15.957
I don't see how you can argue with that.

764
00:40:16.042 --> 00:40:20.582
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

765
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.832
Hey!

766
00:40:30.917 --> 00:40:32.917
This isn't a game.

767
00:40:36.708 --> 00:40:38.957
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

768
00:40:39.042 --> 00:40:40.791
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...

769
00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:44.124
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

770
00:40:44.209 --> 00:40:46.209
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.

771
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.582
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

772
00:40:49.667 --> 00:40:52.999
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

773
00:40:53.084 --> 00:40:54.916
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

774
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.874
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

775
00:40:56.958 --> 00:40:59.624
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

776
00:40:59.708 --> 00:41:01.708
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

777
00:41:02.583 --> 00:41:04.249
I think that's a pretty good guess.
Anyone else?

778
00:41:04.334 --> 00:41:07.124
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

779
00:41:07.209 --> 00:41:09.041
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

780
00:41:09.125 --> 00:41:11.041
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

781
00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:16.166
This. It takes a six-car El train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

782
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.187
Now let's say the
given point is the open

783
00:41:18.211 --> 00:41:20.500
window of the room
where the killing took place.

784
00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:23.874
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the El tracks, right?

785
00:41:23.958 --> 00:41:25.458
Now let me ask you this.

786
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:27.791
Has anyone here
ever lived near the El tracks?

787
00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:31.500
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an El line.

788
00:41:31.583 --> 00:41:33.249
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

789
00:41:33.334 --> 00:41:34.500
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

790
00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:37.124
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

791
00:41:37.209 --> 00:41:39.791
I lived in a second-floor apartment
near the El line once.

792
00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:42.996
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

793
00:41:43.042 --> 00:41:45.893
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- All right, you can't hear yourself think.

794
00:41:45.917 --> 00:41:48.333
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

795
00:41:48.417 --> 00:41:52.041
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

796
00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:56.208
First. The old man in the
apartment downstairs.

797
00:41:56.292 --> 00:41:58.874
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...

798
00:41:58.958 --> 00:42:01.707
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

799
00:42:01.792 --> 00:42:03.375
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

800
00:42:03.459 --> 00:42:09.458
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

801
00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:12.874
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

802
00:42:12.958 --> 00:42:15.291
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

803
00:42:15.376 --> 00:42:16.707
Now, just a minute.

804
00:42:16.792 --> 00:42:21.208
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

805
00:42:22.042 --> 00:42:25.375
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

806
00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:30.416
we can assume that the body
hit the floor just as the train went by.

807
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.957
Therefore, the train had been roaring
by the old man's window...

808
00:42:35.042 --> 00:42:38.540
a full 10 seconds
before the body hit the floor.

809
00:42:38.625 --> 00:42:40.832
The old man,
according to his own testimony...

810
00:42:40.917 --> 00:42:43.832
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later...

811
00:42:43.917 --> 00:42:46.375
would have had to hear the boy
make this statement...

812
00:42:46.459 --> 00:42:48.333
with the El roaring past his nose.

813
00:42:48.417 --> 00:42:49.957
It's not possible he could've heard it.

814
00:42:50.042 --> 00:42:52.268
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

815
00:42:52.292 --> 00:42:54.726
He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
That's good enough for me.

816
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.060
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

817
00:42:57.084 --> 00:42:58.208
With the El roaring by?

818
00:42:58.292 --> 00:43:00.726
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

819
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:05.375
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

820
00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:09.500
You know something?
I don't think he could've heard it.

821
00:43:09.583 --> 00:43:11.916
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that El noise.

822
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.874
Oh, what are you people talking about?

823
00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:15.999
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

824
00:43:16.084 --> 00:43:17.999
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

825
00:43:18.084 --> 00:43:20.291
Attention maybe.

826
00:43:20.376 --> 00:43:22.291
You keep coming in
with these bright sayings!

827
00:43:22.376 --> 00:43:25.416
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

828
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.707
What are you talking to him
like that for?

829
00:43:28.667 --> 00:43:32.083
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?

830
00:43:32.167 --> 00:43:34.167
You ought to have more respect, mister.

831
00:43:35.209 --> 00:43:39.582
If you say stuff like that to him again,
I'm gonna lay you out.

832
00:43:49.541 --> 00:43:52.500
Now you go ahead.
You... You say anything you like.

833
00:43:52.583 --> 00:43:56.624
Why do you think
the old man might lie?

834
00:43:56.708 --> 00:44:00.124
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.

835
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:03.999
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

836
00:44:04.084 --> 00:44:05.666
Or did you notice that?

837
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.249
I mean, to come to court like that.

838
00:44:08.334 --> 00:44:10.334
Why...

839
00:44:11.125 --> 00:44:14.999
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

840
00:44:15.084 --> 00:44:17.957
And he walked very slowly
to the stand.

841
00:44:18.708 --> 00:44:22.749
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...

842
00:44:22.833 --> 00:44:24.833
because he was ashamed.

843
00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:29.041
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

844
00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:35.333
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...

845
00:44:35.417 --> 00:44:37.791
who has been nothing all his life...

846
00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:40.291
who has never had recognition...

847
00:44:40.376 --> 00:44:42.458
or his name in the newspapers.

848
00:44:43.125 --> 00:44:45.333
Nobody knows him.

849
00:44:45.417 --> 00:44:47.458
Nobody quotes him.

850
00:44:47.541 --> 00:44:51.500
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

851
00:44:52.334 --> 00:44:56.208
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing...
to be nothing.

852
00:44:56.917 --> 00:45:01.249
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

853
00:45:01.875 --> 00:45:03.875
To be quoted just once.

854
00:45:03.917 --> 00:45:05.917
Very important to him.

855
00:45:06.292 --> 00:45:08.707
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background...

856
00:45:08.792 --> 00:45:10.500
- Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...

857
00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:13.517
What are you trying to do... tell us he'd
lie just so he could be important once?

858
00:45:13.541 --> 00:45:16.166
No. He wouldn't really lie.

859
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.707
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words...

860
00:45:19.792 --> 00:45:21.999
and recognized the boy's face.

861
00:45:22.084 --> 00:45:24.375
That's the most fantastic story
I've ever heard.

862
00:45:24.459 --> 00:45:27.500
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

863
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:38.582
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?

864
00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:40.916
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

865
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.500
You can say what you like. I still don't
see how anybody can think he's not guilty.

866
00:45:44.583 --> 00:45:47.083
There's something else
I'd like to talk about for a minute.

867
00:45:47.167 --> 00:45:48.791
Thanks.

868
00:45:48.875 --> 00:45:50.563
I think we've proved
that the old man couldn't

869
00:45:50.587 --> 00:45:52.226
have heard the boy
say "I'm gonna kill you."

870
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.832
- But supposing...
- You didn't prove it at all.

871
00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:56.707
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

872
00:45:56.792 --> 00:45:59.208
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

873
00:45:59.292 --> 00:46:00.791
Probably thousands.

874
00:46:00.875 --> 00:46:02.500
"I could kill you for that, darling."

875
00:46:02.583 --> 00:46:04.500
"Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you."

876
00:46:04.583 --> 00:46:05.874
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."

877
00:46:05.958 --> 00:46:07.832
We say it every day. That doesn't mean
we're really gonna kill anybody.

878
00:46:07.917 --> 00:46:09.707
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to give us here?

879
00:46:09.792 --> 00:46:13.500
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

880
00:46:13.583 --> 00:46:14.916
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

881
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.352
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

882
00:46:17.376 --> 00:46:18.832
Well, gee, now I don't know.

883
00:46:18.917 --> 00:46:23.624
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

884
00:46:23.708 --> 00:46:25.458
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.

885
00:46:25.541 --> 00:46:28.500
Now listen! This guy's trying to make you
believe things that aren't so.

886
00:46:28.583 --> 00:46:30.726
The kid said he was gonna kill him,
and he did kill him.

887
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.768
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the
boy would shout out a thing like that...

888
00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:35.582
so the whole neighborhood could hear him?

889
00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:37.500
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

890
00:46:37.583 --> 00:46:42.333
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

891
00:46:42.417 --> 00:46:45.249
"He doesn't even speak good English."

892
00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:51.500
Mr. Foreman, I'd like
to change my vote to not guilty.

893
00:46:51.583 --> 00:46:52.999
You what?

894
00:46:53.084 --> 00:46:55.500
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

895
00:46:56.417 --> 00:46:57.832
Yeah, I'm sure.

896
00:46:57.917 --> 00:47:00.375
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

897
00:47:00.459 --> 00:47:03.249
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?

898
00:47:07.292 --> 00:47:10.041
What are you basing it on
the stories this guy made up?

899
00:47:10.667 --> 00:47:13.060
You ought to write for one of those
kooky detective magazines.

900
00:47:13.084 --> 00:47:14.916
You'd make a fortune.

901
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.416
For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

902
00:47:18.917 --> 00:47:20.500
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

903
00:47:20.583 --> 00:47:22.375
You could see it.

904
00:47:22.459 --> 00:47:26.041
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

905
00:47:26.875 --> 00:47:28.666
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

906
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.582
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

907
00:47:31.667 --> 00:47:34.500
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

908
00:47:34.583 --> 00:47:36.291
He was court-appointed.

909
00:47:36.376 --> 00:47:38.208
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

910
00:47:38.292 --> 00:47:41.540
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

911
00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.458
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing...

912
00:47:43.541 --> 00:47:46.500
no money, no glory,
not even much chance of winning.

913
00:47:46.583 --> 00:47:49.500
That's not a very promising situation
for a young lawyer.

914
00:47:49.583 --> 00:47:52.559
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

915
00:47:52.583 --> 00:47:54.643
and, as you pointed out a minute ago,
obviously he didn't.

916
00:47:54.667 --> 00:47:57.500
Of course he didn't. Huh.

917
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:59.874
Who the heck could?

918
00:47:59.958 --> 00:48:02.874
Except maybe
some guy's mother or somebody. I...

919
00:48:02.958 --> 00:48:05.208
Ah, look.
Will you look at the time, huh?

920
00:48:05.292 --> 00:48:07.832
- Come on. For crying out...
- Pardon me.

921
00:48:07.917 --> 00:48:10.249
- I have made some notes here...
- Notes.

922
00:48:10.334 --> 00:48:12.957
And I would like to...
please, to say something.

923
00:48:13.042 --> 00:48:15.291
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

924
00:48:15.376 --> 00:48:19.791
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

925
00:48:19.875 --> 00:48:24.500
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

926
00:48:24.583 --> 00:48:28.666
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

927
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.041
There is a question I would like to ask.

928
00:48:31.125 --> 00:48:34.416
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

929
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.832
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12:00.

930
00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:40.375
Now, how was he caught by the police?

931
00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:44.957
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...

932
00:48:45.042 --> 00:48:48.791
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

933
00:48:48.875 --> 00:48:53.458
Now, my question is,
if he really had killed his father...

934
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:56.749
why would he come back home
three hours later?

935
00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:59.707
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

936
00:48:59.792 --> 00:49:01.540
He came home to get his knife.

937
00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:04.226
It's not nice to go around leaving knives
sticking in people's chests.

938
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:06.999
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

939
00:49:07.084 --> 00:49:09.333
I don't see anything funny about it.

940
00:49:09.417 --> 00:49:12.957
The boy knew the knife could be identified
as the one he had just bought.

941
00:49:13.042 --> 00:49:15.208
He had to get it before the police did.

942
00:49:15.292 --> 00:49:17.496
But if he knew the
knife could be identified,

943
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.749
why did he leave it
there in the first place?

944
00:49:20.292 --> 00:49:23.166
Well, I think we can assume
the boy ran out in a state of panic...

945
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.624
after having just killed his father.

946
00:49:25.708 --> 00:49:28.666
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

947
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.666
Ah. This then depends
on your definition of panic.

948
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:34.124
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

949
00:49:34.209 --> 00:49:36.791
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

950
00:49:36.875 --> 00:49:40.916
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

951
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.375
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

952
00:49:43.459 --> 00:49:46.999
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

953
00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:48.874
I'm simply asking questions.

954
00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:51.957
Well, this is just off the top of my head,
but, uh...

955
00:49:52.042 --> 00:49:54.601
well, if I were the boy
and I'd done the stabbing and everything...

956
00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:56.749
I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.

957
00:49:56.833 --> 00:49:59.333
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

958
00:49:59.417 --> 00:50:01.916
and that the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.

959
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.041
Well, after all,
it was the middle of the night.

960
00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:06.684
I'll bet he'd figured nobody
would find the body till the next day.

961
00:50:06.708 --> 00:50:08.708
Pardon. This is my whole point.

962
00:50:08.792 --> 00:50:12.500
The woman across the street testified that
the moment after she saw the killing...

963
00:50:12.583 --> 00:50:15.166
that is, a moment
after the train went by...

964
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.249
she screamed
and then went to telephone the police.

965
00:50:18.334 --> 00:50:21.707
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream...

966
00:50:21.792 --> 00:50:25.291
so he knew
that somebody saw something.

967
00:50:25.376 --> 00:50:28.166
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

968
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.060
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

969
00:50:31.084 --> 00:50:32.749
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

970
00:50:32.833 --> 00:50:36.208
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

971
00:50:36.292 --> 00:50:39.333
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

972
00:50:39.417 --> 00:50:41.874
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

973
00:50:41.958 --> 00:50:44.832
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

974
00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:48.624
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

975
00:50:48.708 --> 00:50:51.349
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

976
00:50:51.417 --> 00:50:54.333
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

977
00:50:54.417 --> 00:50:57.226
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

978
00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.916
during the time the killing took place.

979
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.749
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

980
00:51:00.833 --> 00:51:02.540
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

981
00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:04.416
He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.

982
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.832
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

983
00:51:07.917 --> 00:51:09.832
Well, did or didn't he?

984
00:51:09.917 --> 00:51:13.124
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

985
00:51:13.209 --> 00:51:16.226
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

986
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.500
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

987
00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:20.416
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

988
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.208
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

989
00:51:22.292 --> 00:51:23.999
These guys
keep going off every which way.

990
00:51:24.084 --> 00:51:25.999
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

991
00:51:26.084 --> 00:51:29.310
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

992
00:51:29.334 --> 00:51:31.893
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...

993
00:51:31.917 --> 00:51:34.291
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

994
00:51:34.376 --> 00:51:38.041
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

995
00:51:41.917 --> 00:51:44.458
I never saw so much time
spent on nothing.

996
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:46.541
It only takes a second.

997
00:51:47.334 --> 00:51:50.749
Okay. I guess the fastest way
is to find out who's voting not guilty.

998
00:51:50.833 --> 00:51:53.582
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

999
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:58.416
Still the same.
One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.

1000
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.166
So, now where are we?

1001
00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:03.666
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

1002
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:06.500
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

1003
00:52:06.583 --> 00:52:09.582
Oh!

1004
00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:12.957
What are ya talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.

1005
00:52:13.042 --> 00:52:16.832
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

1006
00:52:16.917 --> 00:52:19.166
Tell him, will ya?
Now this is getting to be a joke.

1007
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:22.458
The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

1008
00:52:22.541 --> 00:52:26.208
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1009
00:52:26.292 --> 00:52:28.791
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

1010
00:52:28.875 --> 00:52:33.166
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1011
00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:34.999
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

1012
00:52:35.084 --> 00:52:38.083
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing but words.
Here, look at this.

1013
00:52:38.167 --> 00:52:43.083
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1014
00:52:43.167 --> 00:52:45.167
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1015
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.916
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1016
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.166
Oh, brilliant.

1017
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:52.540
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.

1018
00:52:52.625 --> 00:52:54.791
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?

1019
00:52:54.875 --> 00:52:57.768
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling
stories out of thin air, you know?

1020
00:52:57.792 --> 00:53:01.500
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1021
00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:04.041
he'd be trying to tell you that, uh...

1022
00:53:04.125 --> 00:53:06.500
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1023
00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:09.226
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

1024
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:12.249
and see the kid tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?

1025
00:53:12.334 --> 00:53:14.791
He's just saying so to be important, right?

1026
00:53:14.875 --> 00:53:17.726
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?

1027
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:19.957
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1028
00:53:20.042 --> 00:53:22.060
and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits
wherever we look.

1029
00:53:22.084 --> 00:53:25.333
Hold it a second. Now, look...
Did the old man say he ran to the door?

1030
00:53:25.417 --> 00:53:26.951
Ran,
walked. What's the difference? He got on,

1031
00:53:26.975 --> 00:53:28.435
didn't he? I mean,
he got there, didn't he?

1032
00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:31.060
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1033
00:53:31.084 --> 00:53:34.524
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1034
00:53:34.583 --> 00:53:36.957
Î—e said he went
from his bedroom to the front door.

1035
00:53:37.042 --> 00:53:38.666
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1036
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:41.060
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1037
00:53:41.084 --> 00:53:43.333
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1038
00:53:43.417 --> 00:53:45.624
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1039
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.177
Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all
over again so you can get everything straight?

1040
00:53:48.201 --> 00:53:49.018
Mr. Foreman.

1041
00:53:49.042 --> 00:53:51.726
How come you're the only one in this room
wants to see exhibits all the time?

1042
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:54.458
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1043
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:57.435
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...

1044
00:53:57.459 --> 00:53:59.459
We're not,
not unless somebody else wants to.

1045
00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.208
But I'd like to find out if an old man...

1046
00:54:01.292 --> 00:54:03.726
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1047
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:06.166
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

1048
00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:07.916
- He said 20 seconds.
- Î—e said 15.

1049
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.166
He said 20 seconds.
What are you trying to distort...

1050
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.500
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1051
00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.249
You can't judge a thing like that.

1052
00:54:15.334 --> 00:54:17.707
- He said 15 seconds.
- He was very positive about it.

1053
00:54:17.792 --> 00:54:19.999
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1054
00:54:20.084 --> 00:54:22.375
How could he be positive about anything?

1055
00:54:30.042 --> 00:54:34.166
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

1056
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:36.416
Well, let's see
if the details bear him out.

1057
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.381
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1058
00:54:39.459 --> 00:54:41.124
running toward the front door...

1059
00:54:41.209 --> 00:54:44.291
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1060
00:54:44.376 --> 00:54:46.559
He said he got to his own front door
as fast as he could...

1061
00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:48.726
and he swore it couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.

1062
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.416
Now, if the killer
began running immediately...

1063
00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.707
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1064
00:54:52.792 --> 00:54:55.500
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1065
00:54:56.792 --> 00:54:58.976
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1066
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.185
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1067
00:55:02.209 --> 00:55:03.916
Now that you've got that thing in here,
what about it?

1068
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.226
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1069
00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:09.291
The old man's apartment
was directly beneath and exactly the same.

1070
00:55:09.376 --> 00:55:12.582
Here are the El tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1071
00:55:12.667 --> 00:55:14.667
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.

1072
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.999
Now, the old man
was in this bedroom right here.

1073
00:55:17.084 --> 00:55:19.749
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1074
00:55:19.833 --> 00:55:22.791
opened the front door just in time
to see the boy running down the stairs.

1075
00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:26.208
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

1076
00:55:26.292 --> 00:55:29.832
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

1077
00:55:29.917 --> 00:55:31.957
Now, let's see. It was...

1078
00:55:32.042 --> 00:55:36.041
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

1079
00:55:36.125 --> 00:55:39.333
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...

1080
00:55:39.417 --> 00:55:43.041
walk 43 feet down and open the front door
all in 15 seconds.

1081
00:55:43.125 --> 00:55:45.832
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

1082
00:55:45.917 --> 00:55:48.559
He can walk only very slowly.
They had to help him into the witness chair.

1083
00:55:48.583 --> 00:55:50.249
You make it sound like a long walk.

1084
00:55:50.334 --> 00:55:52.666
For an old man who had a stroke,
it is a long walk.

1085
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:56.166
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.

1086
00:55:56.292 --> 00:55:58.058
What do you mean,
you want to try it? Why didn't

1087
00:55:58.082 --> 00:55:59.726
his lawyer bring it
up if it's so important?

1088
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.003
Maybe he just didn't think about it,
huh?

1089
00:56:01.027 --> 00:56:03.435
What do you mean, didn't think of it?
You think the man's an idiot or something?

1090
00:56:03.459 --> 00:56:04.999
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1091
00:56:05.084 --> 00:56:06.749
Listen, smart guy.
Don't matter whether I thought of it.

1092
00:56:06.833 --> 00:56:09.143
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1093
00:56:09.167 --> 00:56:11.102
Maybe he didn't bring it
up because it would have

1094
00:56:11.126 --> 00:56:13.047
meant bullying and
badgering a helpless old man.

1095
00:56:13.084 --> 00:56:16.416
You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury.
Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1096
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.268
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1097
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:22.333
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

1098
00:56:22.417 --> 00:56:25.291
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.

1099
00:56:25.376 --> 00:56:27.999
Oh, that's crazy.
You can't recreate a thing like that.

1100
00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:30.291
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1101
00:56:30.376 --> 00:56:32.376
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

1102
00:56:33.667 --> 00:56:37.500
Look, this is absolutely insane. What are
you wasting everybody's time in here for?

1103
00:56:37.583 --> 00:56:40.503
According to you, it'll only take 15 seconds.
Now, we can spare that, see.

1104
00:56:44.417 --> 00:56:46.083
Come on. Knock it off.

1105
00:56:46.167 --> 00:56:47.666
Okay.

1106
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:49.791
Okay. Okay, killer.

1107
00:56:49.875 --> 00:56:51.875
Yeah.

1108
00:56:53.792 --> 00:56:55.832
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1109
00:56:55.917 --> 00:56:58.416
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

1110
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.666
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

1111
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.226
When you want me to start, stamp your foot.
That'll be the body falling.

1112
00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:05.166
You can time me from there.

1113
00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:07.333
What are we gonna do, play charades now?

1114
00:57:07.417 --> 00:57:09.517
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

1115
00:57:09.541 --> 00:57:11.458
Well, I want to wait
till the second hand reaches 60.

1116
00:57:11.541 --> 00:57:13.541
Oh, come on.

1117
00:57:20.167 --> 00:57:23.166
Come on. Speed it up.
He could walk twice as fast as that.

1118
00:57:24.625 --> 00:57:27.083
You want me to walk faster than that,
I will.

1119
00:57:43.958 --> 00:57:46.416
Lock. Door. Stop.

1120
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.500
- Right.
- What's the time?

1121
00:57:48.583 --> 00:57:51.832
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.

1122
00:57:51.917 --> 00:57:54.166
This is what I think happened.

1123
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:57.143
The old man heard the fight between the boy
and his father a few hours earlier.

1124
00:57:57.167 --> 00:58:00.060
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1125
00:58:00.084 --> 00:58:01.878
heard the woman scream
from across the street,

1126
00:58:01.902 --> 00:58:03.643
got to his front door
as fast as he could...

1127
00:58:03.667 --> 00:58:06.249
heard somebody racing down the stairs
and assumed it was the boy.

1128
00:58:06.334 --> 00:58:08.166
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

1129
00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:10.749
Oh.

1130
00:58:10.833 --> 00:58:13.725
Brother, I've seen all kinds
of dishonesty in my day,

1131
00:58:13.749 --> 00:58:16.791
but this little display
takes the cake.

1132
00:58:16.875 --> 00:58:19.132
You all come in here
with your hearts bleeding

1133
00:58:19.156 --> 00:58:21.582
all over the floor about
slum kids and injustice.

1134
00:58:21.667 --> 00:58:23.667
You listen to some fairy tales.

1135
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:26.101
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1136
00:58:26.125 --> 00:58:29.083
Well, you're not getting through to me.
I've had enough.

1137
00:58:29.167 --> 00:58:31.208
What's the matter with you guys?

1138
00:58:31.292 --> 00:58:33.999
You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1139
00:58:34.084 --> 00:58:35.874
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

1140
00:58:35.958 --> 00:58:38.166
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?

1141
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.250
I'm one of 'em!

1142
00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:42.916
Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.

1143
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
For this kid, you bet I would.

1144
00:58:45.084 --> 00:58:48.333
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.

1145
00:58:49.209 --> 00:58:51.039
Ever since you walked
into this room, you've

1146
00:58:51.063 --> 00:58:53.124
been acting like a
self-appointed public avenger.

1147
00:58:53.209 --> 00:58:57.500
You want to see this boy die because you
personally want it, not because of the facts.

1148
00:58:57.583 --> 00:58:59.749
- You're a sadist.
- You...

1149
00:58:59.833 --> 00:59:03.666
Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

1150
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:06.166
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1151
00:59:13.459 --> 00:59:15.791
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1152
00:59:15.875 --> 00:59:19.874
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just...
- You know, friendly little argument. It's...

1153
00:59:19.958 --> 00:59:23.249
Um, listen, we're through with that diagram.
You can take it if you want.

1154
00:59:24.625 --> 00:59:26.625
Here you are.
Thank you.

1155
00:59:31.833 --> 00:59:33.916
What are you lookin' at?

1156
00:59:54.667 --> 00:59:56.707
I suppose somebody
has to start it off again.

1157
00:59:56.792 --> 01:00:00.500
- I beg pardon.
- "I beg pardon." What are you so polite about?

1158
01:00:00.583 --> 01:00:02.666
For the same reason you're not.

1159
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:04.750
It's the way I was brought up.

1160
01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:08.582
This fighting...

1161
01:00:08.667 --> 01:00:10.707
That's not why we are here, to fight.

1162
01:00:10.792 --> 01:00:13.166
We have a responsibility.

1163
01:00:14.334 --> 01:00:18.916
This, I have always thought,
is a remarkable thing about democracy...

1164
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
that we are...

1165
01:00:22.084 --> 01:00:24.666
Uh, what is the word?

1166
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.832
Notified.
That we are notified by mail...

1167
01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:32.249
to come down to this place
to decide on the guilt or innocence...

1168
01:00:32.334 --> 01:00:36.375
of a man we have never heard of before.

1169
01:00:36.459 --> 01:00:40.999
We have nothing to gain or lose
by... by our verdict.

1170
01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:45.041
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

1171
01:00:46.334 --> 01:00:49.166
We should not make it a personal thing.

1172
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.500
Thank you.

1173
01:00:53.376 --> 01:00:55.666
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

1174
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.559
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

1175
01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:00.208
and see if the cat licks it up.

1176
01:01:00.292 --> 01:01:02.624
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy...

1177
01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.249
Look how dark it's getting out there.

1178
01:01:09.334 --> 01:01:11.791
I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.

1179
01:01:13.583 --> 01:01:16.041
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?

1180
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:20.333
Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?

1181
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.916
No, I don't.

1182
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Well, listen. I, uh...

1183
01:01:26.084 --> 01:01:29.249
I was wondering if, uh, maybe...

1184
01:01:29.334 --> 01:01:31.624
maybe we should take another vote.

1185
01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:35.999
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

1186
01:01:36.084 --> 01:01:38.084
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?

1187
01:01:38.667 --> 01:01:42.208
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

1188
01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:45.500
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1189
01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:49.083
I think we ought to have an open ballot...
call out our votes, you know.

1190
01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:51.375
Let's see who stands where.

1191
01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:53.957
That sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

1192
01:01:56.708 --> 01:01:59.416
Okay. I'll call off your jury numbers.
One.

1193
01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.208
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

1194
01:02:03.292 --> 01:02:05.083
Two?

1195
01:02:05.167 --> 01:02:07.167
Not guilty.

1196
01:02:07.209 --> 01:02:10.041
- Number three?
- Guilty.

1197
01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:13.042
Number four?

1198
01:02:14.084 --> 01:02:15.874
Guilty.

1199
01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:18.707
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

1200
01:02:19.792 --> 01:02:23.083
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

1201
01:02:24.084 --> 01:02:25.749
Number seven?

1202
01:02:25.833 --> 01:02:27.540
Guilty.

1203
01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:29.666
Number eight?

1204
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:31.750
Not guilty.

1205
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.666
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

1206
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:37.916
- Number 10?
- Guilty.

1207
01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:41.749
Number 11?

1208
01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:43.666
Not guilty.

1209
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:45.750
Number 12?

1210
01:02:46.167 --> 01:02:48.500
Number 12.

1211
01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:50.583
Guilty.

1212
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.083
The vote is now six to six.

1213
01:02:58.167 --> 01:03:01.333
Yeah, right.
And we go into extra innings here, huh?

1214
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:08.249
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

1215
01:03:08.334 --> 01:03:10.166
A kid like that.

1216
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:13.500
I don't think the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it.

1217
01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:15.666
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

1218
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.916
Don't give me that!
I'm sick and tired of facts!

1219
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.060
You can twist them any way you like.
You know what I mean?

1220
01:03:20.084 --> 01:03:22.666
That's exactly the point
this gentleman has been making.

1221
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:23.455
Oh!

1222
01:03:23.479 --> 01:03:25.666
I mean, you keep shouting
at the top of your lungs.

1223
01:03:27.334 --> 01:03:29.249
I'd like to be
a few years younger.

1224
01:03:29.334 --> 01:03:31.334
That man gets on my...

1225
01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:37.458
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

1226
01:03:37.541 --> 01:03:41.249
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

1227
01:03:49.084 --> 01:03:50.874
It's gonna rain.

1228
01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:53.208
Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

1229
01:03:54.459 --> 01:03:56.333
How come you changed your vote?

1230
01:03:56.417 --> 01:03:58.832
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

1231
01:03:58.917 --> 01:04:01.158
You haven't got a leg to stand on.
You know that, I hope.

1232
01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:04.208
I don't feel that way.
There were a lot of details that never came out.

1233
01:04:04.292 --> 01:04:07.832
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

1234
01:04:07.917 --> 01:04:10.124
You think too much.
You get mixed up.

1235
01:04:11.376 --> 01:04:12.565
You know what I mean?

1236
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:15.333
Now, listen.
I don't think you have any right...

1237
01:04:15.417 --> 01:04:17.999
Loudmouth.

1238
01:05:10.667 --> 01:05:13.166
Look at that come down, will you?

1239
01:05:14.334 --> 01:05:16.208
You know...

1240
01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:18.791
this reminds me of a storm we had last...

1241
01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:22.333
Oh, when was that? November...

1242
01:05:22.417 --> 01:05:25.500
I don't know. Something.
It was quite a storm we had there.

1243
01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:27.957
It was right in the middle of a game.

1244
01:05:28.042 --> 01:05:30.666
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

1245
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:33.333
but we just started to move the ball,
right off the tackle.

1246
01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:36.208
Started cutting right...
slash here and slash right in...

1247
01:05:36.292 --> 01:05:38.083
cut right through.

1248
01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.666
And, uh...

1249
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:42.957
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1250
01:05:44.125 --> 01:05:47.500
A real... He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1251
01:05:47.583 --> 01:05:50.083
I wish I had another one just like him.

1252
01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:54.666
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1253
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:56.832
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1254
01:05:56.917 --> 01:05:59.666
And, uh, anyway...

1255
01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:01.832
we're starting to move along real nice.

1256
01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:05.083
Their whole line is just...
they're just coming apart.

1257
01:06:06.376 --> 01:06:10.124
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1258
01:06:10.209 --> 01:06:12.832
Just whoosh... you know, right down.

1259
01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:17.500
Well, that was murder, you know?

1260
01:06:17.583 --> 01:06:20.166
I swear, I... I nearly bawled.

1261
01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:22.582
You just... You couldn't go nowhere.

1262
01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:25.833
Well.

1263
01:06:40.792 --> 01:06:43.291
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1264
01:06:51.042 --> 01:06:52.791
Hey! Î—uh?

1265
01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:56.166
Must have been
on the same switch with the lights.

1266
01:06:57.167 --> 01:07:00.333
Well, things are looking up here, huh?

1267
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Yeah, huh?

1268
01:07:07.334 --> 01:07:09.334
Boy. That's better.

1269
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.500
Hey!

1270
01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:19.583
Two points.

1271
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.250
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

1272
01:07:27.541 --> 01:07:30.416
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1273
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.666
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1274
01:07:33.708 --> 01:07:35.708
You know?

1275
01:07:36.792 --> 01:07:38.792
Pardon me.

1276
01:07:39.376 --> 01:07:41.707
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.

1277
01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:44.166
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1278
01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.250
Yes.

1279
01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:51.041
Say, that business before,
when that tall guy... what's-his-name...

1280
01:07:51.125 --> 01:07:53.832
was trying to bait me...
That doesn't prove anything.

1281
01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:56.500
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1282
01:07:56.583 --> 01:08:00.416
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1283
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.999
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1284
01:08:04.084 --> 01:08:06.375
He was just trying to bait me.

1285
01:08:06.459 --> 01:08:08.459
He did an excellent job.

1286
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:13.458
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1287
01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:16.083
I'm ready to walk into court right now
and declare a hung jury.

1288
01:08:16.167 --> 01:08:17.999
There's no point in this thing
going on any more.

1289
01:08:18.084 --> 01:08:19.416
Yeah. I go for that too.

1290
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:20.938
Listen,
let's take it in to the judge and let

1291
01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:22.393
the kid take his chances
with 12 other guys.

1292
01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:25.310
I don't think the judge will accept a hung jury.
We haven't been in here very long.

1293
01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:26.999
Well, let's find out.

1294
01:08:27.084 --> 01:08:28.791
I'm not in favor of that.

1295
01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:32.083
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1296
01:08:32.167 --> 01:08:35.060
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1297
01:08:35.084 --> 01:08:37.291
You still don't think there's room
for reasonable doubt?

1298
01:08:37.376 --> 01:08:38.666
No, I don't.

1299
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:40.041
Pardon.

1300
01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:43.375
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt."

1301
01:08:43.459 --> 01:08:45.999
What do you mean I don't understand?

1302
01:08:47.084 --> 01:08:49.084
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1303
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.791
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1304
01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:53.768
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1305
01:08:53.792 --> 01:08:56.166
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

1306
01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.041
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1307
01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:02.707
Hey, all right. Let's stop
the arguing for about two minutes in here.

1308
01:09:02.792 --> 01:09:05.166
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1309
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:08.791
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1310
01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:11.540
An important point for the prosecution
was the fact...

1311
01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:14.375
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1312
01:09:14.459 --> 01:09:16.459
during the hours
that the killing took place...

1313
01:09:16.541 --> 01:09:20.416
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1314
01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.021
This gentleman here has put up that point
in here several times.

1315
01:09:23.084 --> 01:09:24.540
That's correct.

1316
01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:26.500
It was the only alibi the boy offered...

1317
01:09:26.583 --> 01:09:29.083
and he himself couldn't back it up
with any details at all.

1318
01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:32.416
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1319
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.957
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1320
01:09:36.042 --> 01:09:39.249
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

1321
01:09:39.334 --> 01:09:40.801
The boy couldn't
remember the names of the

1322
01:09:40.825 --> 01:09:42.559
movies he saw because
be wasn't there that night.

1323
01:09:42.583 --> 01:09:44.624
According to
the police testimony in court...

1324
01:09:44.708 --> 01:09:47.832
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1325
01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.832
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1326
01:09:50.917 --> 01:09:53.517
Do you think you could remember details
under those circumstances?

1327
01:09:53.583 --> 01:09:55.583
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1328
01:09:55.667 --> 01:09:58.226
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1329
01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:00.268
He named the pictures
and the stars who played in them.

1330
01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:03.458
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

1331
01:10:03.541 --> 01:10:06.143
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1332
01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:07.791
in which to memorize them.

1333
01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:10.601
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1334
01:10:10.625 --> 01:10:12.291
on a particular night.

1335
01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:14.124
I'll take the testimony
of the policemen who

1336
01:10:14.148 --> 01:10:15.999
interrogated the boy
right after the murder...

1337
01:10:16.084 --> 01:10:18.500
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1338
01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:20.500
great emotional stress or not.

1339
01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:23.874
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1340
01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:27.208
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1341
01:10:27.292 --> 01:10:29.832
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

1342
01:10:29.917 --> 01:10:31.249
No, it's all right.

1343
01:10:31.334 --> 01:10:33.874
I left the office at 8:30
and went straight home and to bed.

1344
01:10:33.958 --> 01:10:35.624
And the night before that?

1345
01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:38.124
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

1346
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:40.250
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1347
01:10:40.292 --> 01:10:41.624
Monday night?

1348
01:10:41.708 --> 01:10:44.916
When you get down
to New Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

1349
01:10:46.917 --> 01:10:48.917
Monday night?

1350
01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:53.124
Monday night, uh,
my wife and I went to the movies.

1351
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:54.832
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1352
01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:58.166
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1353
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.874
The, um...

1354
01:11:00.958 --> 01:11:03.624
I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh...

1355
01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:07.874
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...

1356
01:11:07.958 --> 01:11:10.416
The...

1357
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.166
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1358
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:15.999
I saw that.
It's called The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1359
01:11:17.292 --> 01:11:19.666
Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1360
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:22.249
Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?

1361
01:11:22.334 --> 01:11:25.999
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1362
01:11:26.084 --> 01:11:28.084
A dark, very pretty girl.

1363
01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:31.916
Ling or Long... something like that.

1364
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.208
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1365
01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:39.707
It was a very inexpensive second feature
with, uh, unknown...

1366
01:11:39.792 --> 01:11:42.916
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1367
01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.957
No.

1368
01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:50.042
I wasn't.

1369
01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:53.333
I think the point is made.

1370
01:11:53.417 --> 01:11:56.166
Big point!

1371
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.416
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1372
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:02.582
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1373
01:12:02.667 --> 01:12:05.916
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1374
01:12:07.917 --> 01:12:10.166
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1375
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.624
There goes your ball game.

1376
01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:15.124
It's only a shower.

1377
01:12:15.209 --> 01:12:17.375
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1378
01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:20.624
Right. Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1379
01:12:23.417 --> 01:12:25.749
Well, we're still tied up six to six.

1380
01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:27.833
Who's got a suggestion?

1381
01:12:27.917 --> 01:12:29.917
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1382
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.458
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1383
01:12:32.541 --> 01:12:34.666
Okay with me.

1384
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.916
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.

1385
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.540
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1386
01:12:40.625 --> 01:12:44.500
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made...

1387
01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:46.208
the downward angle of it, you know?

1388
01:12:46.292 --> 01:12:48.292
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1389
01:12:48.376 --> 01:12:49.999
They've been over it and over it.

1390
01:12:50.084 --> 01:12:52.375
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1391
01:12:52.459 --> 01:12:56.458
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.
His father was 6'2...

1392
01:12:56.541 --> 01:12:58.707
That's a difference of seven inches.

1393
01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:01.458
It's a very awkward thing to stab down
into the chest of someone...

1394
01:13:01.541 --> 01:13:03.541
who's more than half a foot
taller than you are.

1395
01:13:03.625 --> 01:13:05.749
Give me that.

1396
01:13:05.833 --> 01:13:08.624
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1397
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
You...

1398
01:13:16.417 --> 01:13:19.124
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1399
01:13:19.209 --> 01:13:21.957
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?

1400
01:13:22.042 --> 01:13:25.166
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1401
01:13:32.958 --> 01:13:35.375
That's not funny.

1402
01:13:37.459 --> 01:13:41.291
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1403
01:13:41.958 --> 01:13:43.958
Right. Nobody hurt.

1404
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:51.999
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was taller than I was.

1405
01:13:52.084 --> 01:13:54.540
Look at the angle... down and in.

1406
01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:56.707
And this is the way it was done.

1407
01:13:56.792 --> 01:13:58.957
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1408
01:14:01.167 --> 01:14:04.582
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1409
01:14:04.667 --> 01:14:06.667
Can you give me that?

1410
01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.416
Boy, I hate these things.

1411
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.166
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1412
01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.832
- You?
- No.

1413
01:14:12.917 --> 01:14:15.707
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1414
01:14:15.792 --> 01:14:18.582
Well, I have.
You know, on my back stoop...

1415
01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:20.999
the lot across the street, backyard.

1416
01:14:21.084 --> 01:14:23.500
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood where I lived.

1417
01:14:23.583 --> 01:14:26.832
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1418
01:14:26.917 --> 01:14:30.291
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1419
01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:34.333
See, you use too much time
switching hands.

1420
01:14:36.084 --> 01:14:38.582
Here's how... underhanded.

1421
01:14:41.292 --> 01:14:44.333
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1422
01:14:44.417 --> 01:14:47.041
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1423
01:14:47.125 --> 01:14:48.957
That's why they're made to open like that.

1424
01:14:49.042 --> 01:14:50.986
You'd say the boy was
pretty handy with a knife?

1425
01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:51.666
Mm-hmm.

1426
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:54.916
You think he could have made
the kind of wound that killed his father?

1427
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.916
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1428
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.

1429
01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:04.124
How do you know? Were you
in the room when the father was killed?

1430
01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:06.209
No. Neither was anybody else.

1431
01:15:06.292 --> 01:15:09.500
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1432
01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:11.196
I don't think you can
determine what type of

1433
01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.893
wound the boy might
or might not have made...

1434
01:15:12.917 --> 01:15:15.540
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1435
01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:17.957
What do you think?

1436
01:15:18.042 --> 01:15:20.124
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1437
01:15:20.209 --> 01:15:22.209
I don't know.

1438
01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:28.250
How about you?

1439
01:15:28.334 --> 01:15:30.226
I don't know about the rest of them,
but I'm getting

1440
01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:32.143
a little tired of this
yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1441
01:15:32.167 --> 01:15:35.624
It's gettin' us nowhere.
So I guess I'll have to break it up.

1442
01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:38.249
I change my vote to not guilty.

1443
01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:41.666
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1444
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:44.208
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1445
01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:48.249
Hey, listen. You just take care
of yourself, huh? You know?

1446
01:15:48.334 --> 01:15:52.291
He's right. That's not an answer.

1447
01:15:52.376 --> 01:15:55.333
What kind of a man are you?

1448
01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:58.540
You have sat here and voted guilty
with everyone else...

1449
01:15:58.625 --> 01:16:02.874
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1450
01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:07.208
And now you've changed your vote because you
say you're sick of all the talking here?

1451
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:09.666
Now listen, buddy!

1452
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:14.416
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1453
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.999
- Don't you care...
- Now wait a minute!

1454
01:16:17.084 --> 01:16:21.083
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1455
01:16:21.167 --> 01:16:23.041
If you want to vote not guilty...

1456
01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:25.525
then do it because you are convinced
the man is not guilty...

1457
01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:27.375
not because you've had enough.

1458
01:16:27.459 --> 01:16:30.041
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1459
01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:33.333
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1460
01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:35.666
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1461
01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:40.041
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1462
01:16:41.708 --> 01:16:43.333
Look, I don't have to...

1463
01:16:43.417 --> 01:16:46.540
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1464
01:16:46.625 --> 01:16:49.083
All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.

1465
01:16:58.583 --> 01:17:00.208
I want another vote.

1466
01:17:00.292 --> 01:17:02.791
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1467
01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:05.749
I guess the quickest way is a show of hands.
Anyone object?

1468
01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:08.749
Okay. All those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1469
01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:14.832
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1470
01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:19.667
eight.

1471
01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:25.375
Um, nine.

1472
01:17:26.376 --> 01:17:31.375
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1473
01:17:31.459 --> 01:17:33.832
One, two, three.

1474
01:17:33.917 --> 01:17:36.416
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favor of acquittal.

1475
01:17:37.417 --> 01:17:39.582
I don't understand you people!

1476
01:17:39.667 --> 01:17:41.893
I mean, all these picky little points
you keep bringing up.

1477
01:17:41.917 --> 01:17:45.249
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1478
01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:48.832
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...

1479
01:17:48.917 --> 01:17:50.917
and that business
about being at the movies.

1480
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.999
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1481
01:17:54.084 --> 01:17:56.124
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1482
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:58.209
They don't know what the truth is.

1483
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:01.957
And let me tell you, they don't need
any real big reason to kill someone either.

1484
01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:03.791
No, sir.

1485
01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:06.916
They get drunk!
Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1486
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.166
You know that.
And bang... someone's lying in the gutter.

1487
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:13.249
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1488
01:18:13.334 --> 01:18:15.416
You know what I mean? Violent!

1489
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.999
Where are you going?

1490
01:18:17.084 --> 01:18:20.083
Î—uman life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1491
01:18:21.084 --> 01:18:24.083
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1492
01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.226
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1493
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.624
They don't care!

1494
01:18:27.708 --> 01:18:29.916
Oh, sure, there's some good things
about 'em too.

1495
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

1496
01:18:32.042 --> 01:18:35.333
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1497
01:18:35.417 --> 01:18:39.166
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings.
They can do anything.

1498
01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:41.832
What's going on here?

1499
01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:43.957
I'm... I'm trying to tell ya...

1500
01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:46.042
you're making a big mistake, you people.

1501
01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:49.124
This kid is a liar!
I know it. I know all about them.

1502
01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:52.999
Listen to me.
They're no good.

1503
01:18:53.084 --> 01:18:55.416
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1504
01:18:57.459 --> 01:18:59.916
I mean, what...
What's happening in here?

1505
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.249
I'm speaking my piece, and you...

1506
01:19:03.459 --> 01:19:05.459
Listen to me.

1507
01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:07.666
I...

1508
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:10.208
We're... This kid on trial here, his type...

1509
01:19:10.292 --> 01:19:12.292
Well, don't you know about them?

1510
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.707
Th-There's... There's a danger here.

1511
01:19:17.792 --> 01:19:19.874
These people are dangerous.

1512
01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:22.999
They're... wild.

1513
01:19:23.084 --> 01:19:24.999
Listen to me.

1514
01:19:25.084 --> 01:19:27.416
- Listen.
- I have.

1515
01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.500
Now sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1516
01:19:34.417 --> 01:19:37.166
I was only trying to... tell you.

1517
01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:17.916
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1518
01:20:19.042 --> 01:20:23.041
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1519
01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:26.999
I don't really know what the truth is.

1520
01:20:27.084 --> 01:20:29.999
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1521
01:20:31.292 --> 01:20:35.249
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1522
01:20:35.334 --> 01:20:38.333
But we're just gambling on probabilities.

1523
01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.417
We may be wrong.

1524
01:20:40.459 --> 01:20:42.832
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1525
01:20:42.917 --> 01:20:44.375
I don't know.

1526
01:20:44.459 --> 01:20:46.459
Nobody really can.

1527
01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.916
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1528
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.500
and that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1529
01:20:52.583 --> 01:20:57.124
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1530
01:20:58.583 --> 01:21:00.957
We nine can't understand...

1531
01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:03.749
how you three are still so sure.

1532
01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:06.583
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1533
01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:11.458
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1534
01:21:11.541 --> 01:21:13.249
and I have two reasons.

1535
01:21:13.334 --> 01:21:16.458
One, the evidence
given by the woman across the street...

1536
01:21:16.541 --> 01:21:19.166
who actually saw the murder committed.

1537
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:21.832
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1538
01:21:21.917 --> 01:21:25.166
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...

1539
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:30.874
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1540
01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:32.999
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1541
01:21:33.084 --> 01:21:34.999
That's absolutely right.

1542
01:21:35.084 --> 01:21:37.666
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.

1543
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:40.832
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1544
01:21:40.917 --> 01:21:44.500
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1545
01:21:44.583 --> 01:21:48.666
and see directly into the boy's room
across the street.

1546
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:51.375
She tossed and turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.

1547
01:21:51.459 --> 01:21:55.624
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1548
01:21:55.708 --> 01:22:00.832
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing El train.

1549
01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:03.624
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1550
01:22:03.708 --> 01:22:08.500
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1551
01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:13.333
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1552
01:22:14.084 --> 01:22:16.749
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1553
01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:24.125
How about you?

1554
01:22:25.417 --> 01:22:27.874
I... I don't know.

1555
01:22:27.958 --> 01:22:29.958
So much evidence to sift.

1556
01:22:30.042 --> 01:22:32.042
This is a pretty complicated business.

1557
01:22:32.084 --> 01:22:35.874
Frankly, I don't see
how you can vote for acquittal.

1558
01:22:35.958 --> 01:22:38.291
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1559
01:22:38.376 --> 01:22:40.416
You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1560
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:44.083
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1561
01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:46.041
- Yeah, well, maybe...
- Let's vote on it.

1562
01:22:46.125 --> 01:22:48.291
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1563
01:22:48.376 --> 01:22:50.208
Anybody object?

1564
01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:53.333
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1565
01:22:53.417 --> 01:22:55.832
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1566
01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:59.500
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you... this one vote?

1567
01:22:59.583 --> 01:23:03.041
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1568
01:23:03.125 --> 01:23:05.832
Î—ow about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1569
01:23:05.917 --> 01:23:08.416
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1570
01:23:10.667 --> 01:23:12.500
Let's go over it again.

1571
01:23:12.583 --> 01:23:14.500
We've been over it again!

1572
01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:17.111
The boy in the gray
flannel suit here is bouncin

1573
01:23:17.135 --> 01:23:19.375
backwards and
forwards like a tennis ball.

1574
01:23:19.459 --> 01:23:23.291
No point in getting nasty
and trying to turn this into a contest.

1575
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:26.707
Okay.

1576
01:23:26.792 --> 01:23:29.832
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1577
01:23:29.917 --> 01:23:32.041
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

1578
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:36.500
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1579
01:23:36.583 --> 01:23:38.583
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1580
01:23:38.625 --> 01:23:40.999
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1581
01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:44.333
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1582
01:23:44.417 --> 01:23:46.417
Don't you feel well?

1583
01:23:47.417 --> 01:23:49.417
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1584
01:23:49.459 --> 01:23:52.166
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1585
01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:55.166
Uh, the reason I asked about that
was because, uh...

1586
01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:56.832
you were rubbing your nose like...

1587
01:23:56.917 --> 01:23:59.582
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1588
01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:02.874
but you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1589
01:24:02.958 --> 01:24:04.999
I'm trying to settle something here.
Do you mind?

1590
01:24:05.084 --> 01:24:07.084
Well, I think this is important.

1591
01:24:08.167 --> 01:24:09.957
Thank you.

1592
01:24:10.042 --> 01:24:12.666
Now then,
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...

1593
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:15.666
but I was wondering why
you were rubbing your nose like that.

1594
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.416
Oh, come on, will ya?

1595
01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.666
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1596
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:24.999
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1597
01:24:25.084 --> 01:24:29.166
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1598
01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:30.874
Oh. I'm sorry.

1599
01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:34.832
- Is it... Is it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1600
01:24:34.917 --> 01:24:36.666
Now can we get on to something else?

1601
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:41.333
Your eyeglasses made those two
deep impressions on the sides of your nose.

1602
01:24:41.417 --> 01:24:43.582
I hadn't noticed that before.

1603
01:24:43.667 --> 01:24:47.166
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1604
01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:49.166
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1605
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:52.582
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1606
01:24:52.667 --> 01:24:55.208
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1607
01:24:57.125 --> 01:25:00.666
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1608
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:04.291
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1609
01:25:05.292 --> 01:25:07.500
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1610
01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:09.249
Please.

1611
01:25:09.334 --> 01:25:13.083
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1612
01:25:13.167 --> 01:25:15.999
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1613
01:25:16.084 --> 01:25:19.957
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1614
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.124
in my mind.

1615
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:25.209
She had those same marks.

1616
01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:30.375
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1617
01:25:31.417 --> 01:25:36.083
This woman was about, uh...
about 45 years old.

1618
01:25:36.167 --> 01:25:40.124
She was making a tremendous effort
to look 35...

1619
01:25:40.209 --> 01:25:42.416
for her first public appearance.

1620
01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.749
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1621
01:25:45.833 --> 01:25:49.707
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1622
01:25:49.792 --> 01:25:51.458
No glasses.

1623
01:25:51.541 --> 01:25:53.208
No, women do that.

1624
01:25:53.292 --> 01:25:55.707
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

1625
01:25:55.792 --> 01:25:57.624
What do you mean, no glasses?

1626
01:25:57.708 --> 01:26:00.476
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1627
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.707
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.

1628
01:26:02.792 --> 01:26:04.707
So what?
What do ya think that means?

1629
01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:07.059
Listen,
I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!

1630
01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:07.999
Come on. Forget it.

1631
01:26:08.084 --> 01:26:11.083
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1632
01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:14.352
I was the closest one to her. She had these,
uh... these things on the side of her nose.

1633
01:26:14.376 --> 01:26:17.582
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1634
01:26:17.667 --> 01:26:21.540
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1635
01:26:21.625 --> 01:26:25.916
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1636
01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.832
No, they couldn't.

1637
01:26:31.917 --> 01:26:33.917
I didn't see any marks!

1638
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:37.249
I did.

1639
01:26:37.334 --> 01:26:39.874
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1640
01:26:39.958 --> 01:26:42.143
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1641
01:26:42.167 --> 01:26:45.083
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1642
01:26:45.167 --> 01:26:47.249
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

1643
01:26:47.334 --> 01:26:50.534
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1644
01:26:50.583 --> 01:26:52.458
Have her testify without her glasses?

1645
01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:54.493
Did you ever see a woman
who had to wear glasses and

1646
01:26:54.517 --> 01:26:56.559
didn't want to because she
thinks they spoil her looks?

1647
01:26:56.583 --> 01:27:00.083
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1648
01:27:00.167 --> 01:27:03.832
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1649
01:27:03.917 --> 01:27:08.083
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1650
01:27:08.167 --> 01:27:12.749
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

1651
01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:15.041
That's all.

1652
01:27:15.125 --> 01:27:19.124
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1653
01:27:20.833 --> 01:27:22.749
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1654
01:27:22.833 --> 01:27:25.832
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1655
01:27:25.917 --> 01:27:27.666
tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.

1656
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:30.083
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1657
01:27:30.167 --> 01:27:32.684
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1658
01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:34.832
when she turned
to look casually out of the window.

1659
01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:37.726
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1660
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:40.851
The lights went off a split second later.
She couldn't have had time to put them on then.

1661
01:27:40.875 --> 01:27:42.500
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1662
01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:46.666
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1663
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:50.333
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1664
01:27:50.417 --> 01:27:53.226
How do you know what kind of glasses she wore?
Maybe they were sunglasses.

1665
01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:55.874
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1666
01:27:55.958 --> 01:27:59.208
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1667
01:27:59.292 --> 01:28:05.416
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1668
01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.874
You can't send someone off to die
on evidence like that.

1669
01:28:07.958 --> 01:28:09.958
Oh, don't give me that.

1670
01:28:10.042 --> 01:28:12.208
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1671
01:28:12.292 --> 01:28:14.707
- No.
- It's not possible?

1672
01:28:14.792 --> 01:28:16.792
No, it's not possible.

1673
01:28:19.376 --> 01:28:21.376
Is it possible?

1674
01:28:22.417 --> 01:28:24.417
Not guilty.

1675
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:30.916
Do you think he's guilty?

1676
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I think he's guilty.

1677
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:37.750
Do you?

1678
01:28:40.292 --> 01:28:43.333
No. I'm convinced.

1679
01:28:43.417 --> 01:28:44.999
Not guilty.

1680
01:28:45.084 --> 01:28:46.874
What's the matter with you?

1681
01:28:46.958 --> 01:28:48.874
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1682
01:28:48.958 --> 01:28:50.500
Eleven to one.

1683
01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:53.500
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1684
01:28:53.583 --> 01:28:55.666
The knife, the whole business!

1685
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:58.666
Well, you said we could throw out
all the other evidence.

1686
01:29:04.417 --> 01:29:06.582
Well, what do we do now?

1687
01:29:09.583 --> 01:29:11.249
You're alone.

1688
01:29:11.334 --> 01:29:15.166
I don't care whether I'm alone or not!
It's my right.

1689
01:29:18.334 --> 01:29:20.500
It's your right.

1690
01:29:29.625 --> 01:29:32.041
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1691
01:29:33.667 --> 01:29:36.999
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1692
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.124
We're not convinced.

1693
01:29:40.209 --> 01:29:42.999
We want to hear them again.

1694
01:29:43.084 --> 01:29:45.084
We have as much time as it takes.

1695
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:55.208
Everything... Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom...

1696
01:29:55.292 --> 01:29:57.208
but I mean everything...
says he's guilty.

1697
01:29:57.292 --> 01:29:59.749
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?

1698
01:30:01.417 --> 01:30:03.500
Why don't you take that stuff
about the old man?

1699
01:30:03.583 --> 01:30:06.749
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.

1700
01:30:08.417 --> 01:30:10.083
Or this business about the knife.

1701
01:30:10.167 --> 01:30:12.167
What? 'Cause he found another one
exactly like it?

1702
01:30:12.250 --> 01:30:15.582
The old man saw him
right there on the stairs!

1703
01:30:15.667 --> 01:30:18.500
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1704
01:30:19.667 --> 01:30:21.667
Every single thing.

1705
01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:26.249
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1706
01:30:26.334 --> 01:30:29.666
You can't prove he didn't get to the door.

1707
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:32.166
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.

1708
01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:34.832
But you can't prove it!

1709
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:40.375
And what about this business
of the El and the movies?

1710
01:30:40.459 --> 01:30:43.500
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1711
01:30:43.583 --> 01:30:47.791
I'll bet ya $5,000
I'd remember the movies I saw.

1712
01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:50.124
I'm telling ya,
everything that's gone on...

1713
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:54.041
has been twisted and turned!

1714
01:30:54.125 --> 01:30:56.208
This business with the glasses?

1715
01:30:56.292 --> 01:31:01.832
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!

1716
01:31:01.917 --> 01:31:05.874
And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?

1717
01:31:05.958 --> 01:31:09.208
I'm telling ya, I've got
all the facts here.

1718
01:31:10.376 --> 01:31:12.376
Here. Ah...

1719
01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:17.124
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.

1720
01:31:24.334 --> 01:31:26.334
Well?

1721
01:31:28.209 --> 01:31:30.209
Say something!

1722
01:31:35.334 --> 01:31:38.916
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1723
01:31:39.583 --> 01:31:41.500
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1724
01:31:41.583 --> 01:31:44.083
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1725
01:31:47.459 --> 01:31:51.749
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!

1726
01:31:56.583 --> 01:31:58.583
I can't keep...

1727
01:32:03.209 --> 01:32:05.209
No.

1728
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:10.750
Not guilty.

1729
01:32:13.958 --> 01:32:15.958
Not guilty.

1730
01:32:18.625 --> 01:32:20.625
Not...

1731
01:32:30.792 --> 01:32:32.957
Um, we're ready now.

1732
01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:28.500
Hey!

1733
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.166
What's your name?

1734
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:35.749
Davis.

1735
01:34:35.833 --> 01:34:37.833
My name's McCardle.

1736
01:34:40.084 --> 01:34:41.749
Well, so long.

1737
01:34:41.833 --> 01:34:43.833
So long.
