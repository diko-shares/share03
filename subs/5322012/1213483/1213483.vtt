Jo!

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.150
Mommy!

3
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.039
- Mommy!
- Clare.

4
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.838
Mommy!

5
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.069
How far can I go?

6
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.554
Just down the street and back.

7
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.637
- You gonna visit the nest for me?
- Yes!

8
00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:47.030
Okay.

9
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.629
Go on, big girl.

10
00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.870
Whee!

11
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.950
Come on, Max.

12
00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.712
Hey, I'll keep an eye on her for you.

13
00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.713
Max! Max!

14
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.670
I win.

15
00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.472
Come on, back in.

16
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.556
Come on!

17
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.316
Come on, boy!

18
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.120
Max, come on!

19
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.629
Come on.

20
00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.954
Mrs. Deluca they hatched!

21
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.953
That is so great sweetie!

22
00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.996
Come on, Max!

23
00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.189
Momma?

24
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.949
Mommy?

25
00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.469
Momma?

26
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.709
Morning!

27
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.314
Aw, you look so nice.

28
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.273
- Bye!
- Bye, Mrs. Deluca.

Hi, Uncle August.

41
00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.798
- No, I'll get the paper.
- Thank you, Clare.

I'm trying to drive here!

45
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.670
Ow!

46
00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:19.949
Oh, gosh...

47
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.271
Are you alright?

48
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.509
Yeah, you know. It's...

49
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.920
it's Monday.

50
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.797
Here you go.

51
00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.360
- Thanks
- Yeah.

52
00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.630
See you around.

53
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.956
I'll check these. See if there's...

54
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.112
You've gotta be kidding me.

55
00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.115
Come on!

56
00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.550
Check it out.

57
00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.110
Dad!

58
00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:05.430
You serious?

59
00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:07.637
What'd I do now?

60
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.230
You promised
that you wouldn't do this at my school.

61
00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.029
We're not at your school.

62
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.394
We're across the street from your school.

63
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.550
Yeah, but people can still see you.

64
00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:16.709
Well, who the hell's watching?

65
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.632
Yeah, her dad's a dumpster driver.

66
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.040
Hey, what happened there?

67
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.435
I fell at Uncle August's house,
he saw the whole thing.

68
00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:26.872
What did I tell you
about talking to Uncle August?

69
00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.917
You said not to. But I really don't see why.

70
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.512
Dad, you're killing me, okay?

71
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.951
Hey!

72
00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.514
Come on, let's roll out, Shannon.

73
00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.031
Thank you.

74
00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.750
<i># You get so excited by the prospect #</i>

So...

78
00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.949
what do you guys think?

79
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.870
So good.

80
00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.759
- How long it take you?
- Ah, yeah, like weeks.

81
00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:05.672
Clare, you try way too hard, dude.

82
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.593
Jesus, it's better than not trying at all.

83
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.797
- Will you guys help me hang it?
- I got you.

84
00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.439
Yeah, just give me one sec.

85
00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.076
What is she doing?

86
00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.875
It's called <i>Monster Mutant Slayer.</i>

87
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.550
Dumbest game ever.

88
00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.473
Hey! Don't mock
what you don't understand dude, okay?

89
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.516
If I kill Lurching Louisa and Hacked-Up Harry

90
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.954
I level up to Mutant Killer.

91
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.512
And if I get Malformed Molly,
I'm a Monster Mutant Master, man!

92
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.079
I know. Awesome? Yes.

93
00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.639
Got it.

94
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.632
- Stop!
- Sorry. Don't mind him.

95
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.831
My bad.

96
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.319
Seriously? Bird ass!

97
00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:45.396
Recycle first.

98
00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:48.675
Recycle first.

99
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.271
Hey, Clare.

100
00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:54.870
I liked your banner.

101
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.233
Yeah, I liked it too.

102
00:08:56.759 --> 00:08:57.955
Hey, Carl!

103
00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:58.951
Look at this!

104
00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.559
That would fetch a ton at the swap.

105
00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:03.354
I have a better idea.

106
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.960
- Jesus, what's...
- It's so bad.

107
00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.759
Put it away.

108
00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:16.879
I mean she's seriously smeggy.

109
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.076
Like ultimate smeggy.

110
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.634
- I know!
- What was that?

111
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.630
Um...

112
00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:22.390
nothing. No.

113
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.596
Um. Mm. But you were laughing.

114
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.830
Which is co-signing.

115
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.110
And we wanna know
what you were laughing about.

116
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.590
Go ahead.

117
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.110
Everyone's listening.

118
00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:34.831
Okay.

119
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.517
Clare, come on.

120
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.080
Go Clare. Yeah, do it.

121
00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:39.990
What's so funny, winner?

122
00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:42.600
Yeah, what's funny...

123
00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:45.352
is that you're smegma.

124
00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:47.596
But like...

125
00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:49.318
ultimate smegma.

126
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.798
What does that even mean?

127
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.113
- Oh, Clare. I got it.
- Well..

128
00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:57.230
Thank you.

129
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.673
Yeah, this is great. Um...

130
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.874
Smegma. It's a noun.

131
00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:05.438
"A malodorous, opaque,
white or yellow substance

132
00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:10.274
produced by the sebaceous glands
of male and female genitalia."

133
00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:13.714
It's found beneath the foreskin and glands
of the penis in males,

134
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.755
and in the folds of skin surrounding
the clitoris in females.

135
00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:21.071
Oh, I... I...

136
00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:24.836
I'm so sorry. Would you like me to define
"ultimate" for you?

137
00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.990
Oooh!

138
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.077
Come on. Yeah.

139
00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:33.832
You got it, Clare!

140
00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:39.792
Get up! Get up!

141
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.951
Beat her up, Clare!

142
00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:54.431
Drop her like a red-headed baby
fresh out of the vagina!

143
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.357
Get away from her! Let her go!

144
00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:02.990
Ooh!

145
00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:15.759
Son of a bitch! Get back here!

146
00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:26.471
What's in it?

147
00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:28.552
It's broccoli, apple, lemon and ginger.

148
00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:30.278
'Cause we don't want you to bruise.

149
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.630
You know what you need.

150
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.434
Please don't say it. Please.

151
00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:35.915
A nice boy.

152
00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:38.471
- You said it.
- Or a nice girl.

153
00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:39.913
Come on, come on, come on.

154
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.990
You must like someone.

155
00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:42.995
I do, but...

156
00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:45.389
So what's his or her name?

157
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:46.951
Paul.

158
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.912
I think he said hi to me once.

159
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.150
Well, that's something.

160
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.030
In the fifth grade.

161
00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.395
Hi, Max.

162
00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:00.635
Hey.

163
00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:03.791
There you go.

164
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.033
Man, you got the green stuff.

165
00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:13.230
It's called "salad".

166
00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:15.793
It's healthy and you're welcome.

167
00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:17.433
I got you a little something, buddy.

168
00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.556
It's up on your bed.

169
00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:21.360
Dad, please...
we've talked about this already.

170
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.350
You've your space

171
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.953
- and then there's my space.
- I know!

172
00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:27.510
I just found it at this fancy place.
It's got Chinese writing on it.

173
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.272
Figured since you're taking Chinese...

174
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.078
If you don't want it, Carl'll take it.

175
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.509
Shit, you're damn right.

176
00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:37.793
Just consider it an early birthday present.

177
00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:39.200
Come on, Max.

178
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.110
Whoa!

179
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.793
"Wishes...

180
00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:05.870
seven."

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:41.308
<i># And a little part, #
# Of the fear is gone... #</i>

187
00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:42.549
Of course that would happen.

188
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.870
<i># When you say goodnight... #</i>

189
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.034
<i># These Night Lies #
# Ya little bit of my heart... #</i>

190
00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:12.558
Seven wishes...

191
00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:17.754
Why not?

192
00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:23.038
I wish that...

193
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.874
Darcie Chapman,

194
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.150
would just...

195
00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:32.915
I don't know, but just, like, go rot!

196
00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:41.471
Max?

197
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.316
Come on! Come here!

198
00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:51.874
Okay.

199
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.676
Oh, my God!

200
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.790
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

201
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.995
Oh, my God!

202
00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:47.919
Oh, my God.

203
00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:52.915
Oh, my God!

204
00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.350
Darcie?

205
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.509
Darcie!

206
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.114
Oh! Ah!

207
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.953
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

208
00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:09.919
Necrotizing fasciitis.

209
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.108
- No!
- Yeah.

210
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.155
- What?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.071
So apparently, She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

212
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.833
picked up a case of it at the spa.

213
00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.194
And now she's at the ICU.

214
00:17:18.279 --> 00:17:21.755
She might lose her toes, part
of her leg, and part of her face.

215
00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.319
How sweet is that?

216
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.518
Ah, she's rotting!

217
00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.510
Yeah.

218
00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.637
Apparently Karma is a bigger bitch
than Darcie Chapman.

219
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.756
Who knew?

220
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.116
Oh!

221
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.029
- It's for Darcie.
- Oh!

222
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.277
You said that like we should care.

223
00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:41.952
Um, we're starting a GoFundMe.

224
00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:43.916
Go fund this.

225
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.876
Yeah.

226
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.278
- Go on. Scooch. Bye.
- It's fine. It's fine.

227
00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:51.317
- Meredith.
- It's whatever.

228
00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:53.672
- Oh, my God!
- You're proud.

229
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.353
- I gotta go.
- All right.

230
00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.152
Definitely have my attention, lucky box.

231
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.440
Max, come here.

232
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.351
Max?

233
00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.195
Max?

234
00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:35.635
Where are you?

235
00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:37.951
Max?

236
00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:43.477
Ma...

237
00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:53.034
Max, are you in there? Buddy?

238
00:18:56.559 --> 00:18:57.471
Buddy?

239
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.830
You in there?

240
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.471
You know you're not supposed to be down here.

241
00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:14.269
Ow.

242
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.435
Max?

243
00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:47.556
Max!

244
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.589
He was a good dog.

245
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.720
Mom gave him to me.

246
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.469
I know, buddy.

247
00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:20.631
But the majority of the characters
are written in Ancient Chinese.

248
00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:24.431
If you want an accurate translation,
you'll probably have to talk to a scholar.

249
00:20:25.519 --> 00:20:27.159
- Got it. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

250
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:31.395
My cousin could hook it up.

251
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.519
Ancient Chinese is her thing.

252
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.640
She'd help you out, for a price.

253
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.278
I don't really have any money.

254
00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:38.430
Who said anything about money?

255
00:20:38.519 --> 00:20:39.509
He'll take a tit pic.

256
00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:40.510
- Uh...
- And so will I.

257
00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:43.997
- What?
- Um...

258
00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:45.036
Never mind.

259
00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:46.030
Sorry.

260
00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:48.157
Offer still stands if you change your mind.

261
00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:51.271
- Dude, seriously?
- Just kidding.

262
00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:52.395
<i>Hey guys, do you feel that?</i>

263
00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:54.477
It's like the darkness has been lifted

264
00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:56.836
ever since Bitchface-Since-Birth
left the building.

265
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.392
I heard they had to amputate
a few of her toes.

266
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.950
Sweet.

267
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.998
Guys, we shouldn't be happy about this.

268
00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:05.797
Clare, I never said I was happy.

269
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.511
I'm freaking ecstatic, man!

270
00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:10.920
Almost like being here.

271
00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:33.039
<i># Laying me down #</i>

272
00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:35.714

00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:37.916

278
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.353

279
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.398

280
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.676
<i># I'll wait up with you #

281
00:22:13.759 --> 00:22:15.273
I wish that

282
00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:19.593
Paul Middlebrook
would fall madly in love with me.

283
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.152

Oh!

288
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.310
Hey.

289
00:22:47.119 --> 00:22:48.190
Hey.

290
00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:26.549
- Paul?
- Yeah.

291
00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:29.114
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

292
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.236
- So I...
- Bell ringing.

293
00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:43.595
I'll see you around Claire.

294
00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:46.670
Yep!

295
00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:55.512
Oh, my God. Oh, My God.

296
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.719
<i>And now, this news just coming in.</i>

297
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.029
- <i>A local resident...</i>
- Hey.

298
00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:18.630
<i>...owner of the iconic
glass house estate in Gates Mills</i>

299
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.039
- What's going on?
- <i>August Anderson,</i>

300
00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:23.271
<i>was found deceased
in his residence this afternoon.</i>

301
00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.314
Are we going to the funeral?

302
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.671
Hey, as far as I'm concerned, good riddance.

303
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.720
What's gonna happen to all of his stuff?

304
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.480
If there's a will, trust me, we ain't in it.

305
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.391
Yeah.

306
00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:41.471
Course not.

307
00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:46.230
Ow! Dammit, Dad! Come on!

308
00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:49.790
- What?
- We don't have room for all of this crap!

309
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.108
Hey, hey, hey.

310
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.554
- What?
- I'm going to use those.

311
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.393
What do you need these for, huh?

312
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.471
Dad, seriously.
You can't get rid of anything!

313
00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:00.474
What would Mom say, huh?

314
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.871
Dad.

315
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.949
Dad! Are you listening to... God!

316
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.432
You never listen to anything I say!

317
00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:25.509
Come on.

318
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.310
I wish...

319
00:25:35.079 --> 00:25:38.278
I wish that Uncle August
would leave me everything.

320
00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:40.431
So there.

321
00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:51.557
God, Clare, you're so stupid.

322
00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:00.393
Uh, thank you for calling.

323
00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:04.471
What's going on, Dad?

324
00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:08.630
You're never gonna believe this.

325
00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:10.871
What?

326
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.679
Apparently, you weren't cut out of his will.

327
00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:17.720
How much do we get?

328
00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:22.990
All of it, buddy.

329
00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:25.396
No way.

330
00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:26.913
Yes... way.

331
00:26:33.079 --> 00:26:34.230
Yes!

332
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.990
Yes! Yes! What?

333
00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:38.030
Yes!

334
00:26:39.319 --> 00:26:40.355
You're gonna...

335
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:42.353
- take the sax with us?
- Why not?

336
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:45.279
No, you just you haven't played since mom...

337
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.790
You never know.

338
00:26:48.759 --> 00:26:50.318
I'm so happy for you.

339
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.115
Sweetheart.

340
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.278
Come visit, or you'll hurt my feelings.

341
00:26:55.839 --> 00:26:57.512
- Of course.
- Okay.

342
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.192
- Dad?
- Down here, bud.

343
00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:13.951
- What are you waiting for? Get in!
- Okay, okay, okay.

344
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.640
Oh, my God!

345
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.994
Call the girls.

346
00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:22.160
<i># 'Cause all we ever wanted #
# Was to feel like this #</i>

347

<i># All we ever wanted #</i>

351
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.758
Um, Clare, that thing is,
like, eight hundred dollars.

352
00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:49.875
I know.

353
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.633
Yeah, so if you buy it, you're an asshole.

354
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.830
Totally.

355
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.510
You want one?

356
00:27:55.599 --> 00:27:58.433
No! Wait, I'm not that psycho shallow,
dude. Come on.

357
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.070
June?

358
00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:03.637
I love you. You're my bestest friend ever.

359
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.153
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

360
00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:07.191
Damn!

361
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.069
Peer pressure.

362

<i># All we ever wanted #
# Was to feel like this #</i>

363
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.513
Out of the way, peasants.

365
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.150
<i># All we ever wanted #
# Was to feel like this #</i>

366
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.200
<i># Feel like this it's all we ever wanted #</i>

367
00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:31.711
- Bye, guys!
- Bye!

368
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.230
Hmm...

369
00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:09.438
I found something you might like.

370
00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:11.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

371
00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:13.034
They're your mother's.

372
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.829
I found them when I was packing up our stuff.

373
00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.752
Wow.

374
00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.231
I forgot how good she was.

375
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.439
Where do you think you get it from?

376
00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:28.953
Some of these are so happy.

377
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.790
So was she.

378
00:31:34.319 --> 00:31:35.355
Until she wasn't.

379
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.079
Why do you think she did it?

380
00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:52.277
Buddy, I've been asking myself that
every single day for the last 12 years.

381
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.309
Still don't have an answer.

382
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.634
Do you think I'm like her?

383
00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.909
Course you are.

384
00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:06.795
No, no, no, sweetie, no.

385
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.715
Not like that.

386
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.710
What I mean is, you're smart and funny,
you don't take people's crap.

387
00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:19.593
Well, statistically, if you have a parent
that committed suicide...

388
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.400
Clare, she was a good woman,
but she had a rough childhood.

389
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.354
And secrets, honey.

390
00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:26.715
I think that...

391
00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:30.191
I think maybe...

392
00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:33.869
her secrets were too big to live with and...

393
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.519
it was easier to just let go.

394
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.200
I'm sorry. Come here.

395
00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:08.119
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just not into it any more.

396
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.992
It's not you... It's just...

397
00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.119
Are you breaking up with me?

398
00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.998
I can't date someone
I don't have feelings for.

399
00:34:16.039 --> 00:34:16.951
Right.

400
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.231
Right.

401
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.791
Oh!

402
00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:33.550
Oh!

403
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:35.309
So, will you?

404
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.396
Will I, what?

405
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.391
Go out with me?

406
00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.070
Look...

407
00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:42.150
I know this is short notice but

408
00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.960
Senior Scavenge is coming up,
I thought it would be fun if we went.

409
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.195
Paul, you just broke up with your girlfriend.

410
00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.036
Plus, I already have a team... but thank you.

411
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.159
But, we can still go.

412
00:34:57.039 --> 00:34:58.235
Yeah, I'll think about it.

413
00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.878
Yeah.

414
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.280
Oh! Um...

415
00:35:02.199 --> 00:35:03.110
I'll see you around.

416
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.670
Nice.

417
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.155
Whoo!

418
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.030
- That's it.
- Ryan!

419
00:35:37.119 --> 00:35:37.951
What's the price?

420
00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:38.951
Of?

421
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.070
Your cousin helping me translate something.

422
00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:44.719
Ah... well.

423
00:35:45.159 --> 00:35:46.434
She's a slut for wontons.

424
00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:47.476
Oh?

425
00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:48.596
Done, yeah.

426
00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.637
- When can we go?
- Let's go right now!

427
00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:52.150
Awesome.

428
00:35:54.559 --> 00:35:57.393
<i># Baby, I was so sad #</i>

429
00:35:58.519 --> 00:35:59.351
<i># Stuck on the couch #</i>

430
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.476
So... I'm waiting.

431
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.717
For?

432
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.153
An apology. Been waiting for years.

433
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.989
What did I do?

434
00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:11.277
First grade. Sharing circle. You farted.

435
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.588
I did not fart!

436
00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:14.751
You farted and you blamed it on me

437
00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.798
and everyone called me McFarts
until, like, the sixth grade.

438
00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:19.471
I'm sorry.

439
00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:21.434
Are you really?

440
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.036
Yeah.

441
00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:25.954
Then apology accepted.

442
00:36:27.159 --> 00:36:29.833
But maybe in the multiverse,
it never happened.

443
00:36:30.719 --> 00:36:33.518
Or it did happen and you farted,

444
00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:35.989
blamed it on me and I got called McFarts.

445
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.391
Wait.

446
00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:38.670
You dig on multiverses?

447
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.840
Yeah, I mean, the theory that,
you know, another you exists

448
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.989
in different circumstances

449
00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:47.231
under different planes of reality,
yada, yada, yada.

450
00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:48.550
Yeah, I dig.

451
00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:51.356
Well, maybe in the multiverse,
neither of us farted.

452
00:36:52.559 --> 00:36:53.960
Maybe we're even dating.

453
00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.070
Maybe.

454
00:36:58.679 --> 00:36:59.795
Maybe not.

455
00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:09.273
Hey, Gina, it's me. Let me up.

456
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.750
This.

457
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.391
Bitchin'.

458
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.871
Yeah, I don't know anything about it.

459
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:19.871
And I can't...

460
00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:22.552
I can't really read what it says, but...

461
00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:23.960
Can you open it?

462
00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:29.398
Well, it looks like a
version of a Chinese Wish Pot.

463
00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.556
They're pretty common actually.

464
00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:33.791
You take a piece of paper,
write down your wish,

465
00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.916
put it in the pot,
and wait for it to come true.

466
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.719
Let's see. This one.

467
00:37:38.519 --> 00:37:39.590
It's heavy.

468
00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:42.070
Okay, it promises to grant seven wishes.

469
00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:44.034
And there are rules.

470
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.753
"Lay your hands upon me."

471
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.150
I guess you have to be touching it
to make a wish?

472
00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:54.438
"Abandon, lose, or sell me
and all your wishes will be undone."

473
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.670
Huh.

474
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.476
Yeah, and what does... What does this say?

475
00:38:01.719 --> 00:38:03.791
That is not a word. It's a name.

476
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.311
"Lu Mei"?

477
00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.672
"The legend of Lu Mei."

478
00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:17.431
"In 1910, bubonic plague swept through
mainland China.

479
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.360
Lu Mei and her family were suspected
of being infected

480
00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.556
so they were quarantined in a train car

481
00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:25.438
where they died of heat stroke
and dehydration.

482
00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:27.398
Lu Mei was the only survivor.

483
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.751
Local legend says she took the only
valuable thing the family owned,

484
00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:35.431
a music box, and went to a temple
to pray for revenge.

485
00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:38.318
She prayed for seven days and seven nights

486
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.074
and on the seventh night,
a <i>Yaoguai</i> answered."

487
00:38:41.159 --> 00:38:42.070
<i>"Yaoguai"</i>?

488
00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:44.231
A demon of the Chinese persuasion.

489
00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.311
If you believe in that sort of thing.

490
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.554
It says, "Lu Mei became very wealthy
and her enemies were vanquished.

491
00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.110
In 1922, she died.

492
00:38:56.199 --> 00:38:57.110
Suicide.

493
00:38:57.639 --> 00:38:58.550
Opium."

494
00:38:59.079 --> 00:38:59.990
Romantic.

495
00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:01.195
So...

496
00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.032
what do these numbers mean on the bottom?

497
00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.800
I have no idea.

498
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.036
A mystery.

499
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.309
Um... It also says,

500
00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.478
"When the music ends..."

501
00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:13.474
something happens.

502
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.911
Like?

503
00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:17.592
I don't know.
It could be a few different things but

504
00:39:17.679 --> 00:39:20.717
my guy Mike at UWA, he's pretty smart, so

505
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.757
I will let you know what he says.

506
00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:24.440
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

507
00:39:24.519 --> 00:39:26.273
- Here, get this.
- Thanks.

508
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.871
All right. Well, me and my 'tons
need some time alone.

509
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.916
I prefer to destroy them in private.

510
00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:34.070
Need anything else?

511
00:39:34.159 --> 00:39:35.798
- No. We're out.
- Cool.

512
00:39:36.159 --> 00:39:38.197
- It was great to meet you.
- You too.

513
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.474
Thanks.

514
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.436
Hey, hey.

515
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.434
She's cute. Ask her out.

516
00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:47.599
I'm trying.

517
00:39:48.199 --> 00:39:49.998
Good luck.

518
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.349
- Bye!
- Bye.

519
00:39:54.679 --> 00:39:55.795
Aww.

Nothing. I just...
I feel like Lu Mei's box...

Good stuff in here.

Dad, what are you doing?

527
00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:15.519
Wha... What are you talking about?

528
00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:17.916
I'm just hanging out with Carl,
picking up some stuff.

529
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.833
Dad, we live in a fricking mansion.
What else do you need?

530
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.989
Clare.

531
00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:23.672

No. Totally didn't see your dad

00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:45.630
Ryan.

546
00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:17.157
Can I say something totally inappropriate?

547
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.679
Sure, go for it.

548
00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.195
Your dad is, like...

549
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.559
serious hot sauce.

550
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.432
Like Sriracha hot.

551
00:42:38.239 --> 00:42:39.309
Yes!

552
00:42:41.199 --> 00:42:42.952
<i>Yo, it's Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

553
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.717
Hey, it's Gina.
I got that translation for you and...

554
00:42:47.559 --> 00:42:49.074
it's messed up.

555
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.878
Fuck! Um...

556
00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:56.632
it's so messed up,
it's actually beginning to freak me out.

557
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.115
So, ah, call me back
as soon as you can and...

558
00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:17.833
Hey, Gina, it's me. Let me up.

559
00:44:21.719 --> 00:44:22.949
Hello?

560
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.755
Gina!

561
00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.876
Gina!

562
00:44:52.719 --> 00:44:53.914
Gina?

563
00:44:57.559 --> 00:44:59.835
No. No, no, no, no!

564
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.391
Fuck!

565
00:45:03.119 --> 00:45:04.030
Oh, my God!

566
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.590
- Oh, hey. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

567
00:45:07.679 --> 00:45:09.478
- I'm well. Where you going?
- Um...

568
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:12.831
just the class that we're in together.

569
00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.480
Oh, yeah. Duh! I'll walk you there.

570
00:45:15.559 --> 00:45:17.199
Sounds great. Thanks.

571
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.556
- Clare!
- Oh, hey, I'll see you at class.

572
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.269
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Ryan, where have you been?

573
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.315
Is everything okay?

574
00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.356
Can I ask you something?
It's gonna sound so...

575
00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.434
stupid and so crazy but, um...

576
00:45:30.599 --> 00:45:32.114
You know that wish box your dad got you?

577
00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:33.554
Have you made any wishes?

578
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.077
- What? Why?
- So, have you wished?

579
00:45:36.679 --> 00:45:38.239
Why do you keep asking me that?

580
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.231
Why don't you answer?

581
00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:40.920
Has it played any music yet?

582
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.228
Ryan, who cares? I...

583
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.309
"A blood price."

584
00:45:44.519 --> 00:45:46.476
That phrase Gina couldn't quite translate.

585
00:45:46.559 --> 00:45:47.471
It says...

586
00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.873
"When the music ends,
the blood price is paid."

587
00:45:51.559 --> 00:45:52.789
Um...

588
00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.030
tell her I said thanks.

589
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.675
What? What is it?

590
00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.909
Ah, she's, uh...

591
00:46:02.039 --> 00:46:03.315
She's dead, Clare.

592
00:46:05.079 --> 00:46:05.990
Oh, my God!

593
00:46:06.719 --> 00:46:08.791
I'm so sorry. When did...

594
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.271
A few nights ago.

595
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.918
I don't even know what to say...

596
00:46:13.039 --> 00:46:14.393
Did it play its music then?

597
00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.233
I don't know what you're talking about.

598
00:46:19.519 --> 00:46:21.000
How'd you get to live in that mansion, again?

599
00:46:22.039 --> 00:46:24.190
We're gonna be late for class, Ryan.
Are you coming?

600
00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:25.510
Have you?

601
00:46:26.119 --> 00:46:27.076
Clare!

602
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.717
<i>We're going to be studying
southern China, the area of Guangzhou.</i>

603
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.918
<i>First we're going to start
with the northernmost state...</i>

604
00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.351
Clare!

605
00:46:48.559 --> 00:46:49.471
Come join us.

606
00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:54.753
- Um, Paul...
- Okay.

607
00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:57.114
Oh, did that just happen?

608
00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.271
I think so.

609
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.911
- Oh, oh.
- Oh! Burn.

610
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.320
Still a nobody.

611
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.949
How's it feel, winner?

612
00:47:16.639 --> 00:47:17.710
We're outta here.

613
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.436
Haters gonna hate.

614
00:47:22.519 --> 00:47:24.193
There's not much you can do about it.

615
00:47:49.079 --> 00:47:52.311
I wish that I was
the most popular girl in school.

616
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.514
Yeah. That'd be awesome.

617
00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:22.349
<i># You wake the wild-hearted rebel in me #</i>

00:49:02.519 --> 00:49:03.873
You coming with me, right?

629
00:49:04.519 --> 00:49:06.193
- Where?
- Senior Scavenge.

630
00:49:07.519 --> 00:49:09.715
- Yes.
- Finally. Say it again.

631
00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:11.838
Yes.

632
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.478
- What?
- Nothing.

633
00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:19.554
I was trying to think of something
dope to say before I kissed you.

634
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.108
That wasn't it.

635
00:49:24.679 --> 00:49:27.956
<i># This path is difficult we travel on #</i>

636
00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:31.114

639

640
00:50:25.719 --> 00:50:26.630
Hey!

641
00:50:26.719 --> 00:50:28.632
Hey! Wait, hey!

642
00:50:46.159 --> 00:50:47.195
Hello?

643
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.715
Who are you?

644
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.869
Hello?

645
00:51:05.039 --> 00:51:05.836
- Clare.
- Oh!

646
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:07.239
What's going on?

647
00:51:09.159 --> 00:51:10.389
Nothing. I just...

648
00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.436
Um...

649
00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.998
I think that someone's following me.

650
00:51:14.079 --> 00:51:16.436
- What? Since when?
- Um...

651
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.715
Since I got the music box.

652
00:52:03.679 --> 00:52:05.398
Mrs. Deluca, are you home? It's Clare.

653
00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:09.635
Mrs. Deluca?

654
00:52:12.119 --> 00:52:13.030
Ugh!

655
00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:19.871
Hello?

656
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.074
Hey. What's up?

657
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.510
- So cute.
- Beyond cute.

658
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.231
I don't know, Clare.

659
00:53:20.679 --> 00:53:22.432
Why don't you go ask your new friends?

660
00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.512
I mean, seriously, I don't get it.

661
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.557
Why is everyone so into you lately?

662
00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:28.956
You're not that special.

663
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.269
Truth.

664
00:53:33.039 --> 00:53:34.030
Hey.

665
00:53:34.119 --> 00:53:35.030
What's wrong?

666
00:53:39.039 --> 00:53:40.996
I need to talk to you guys about something.

667
00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.637
I don't know what's going on and...

668
00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.635
I don't know what to do.

669
00:53:49.239 --> 00:53:50.070
This is it?

670
00:53:50.159 --> 00:53:52.594
Don't... kick... that!

671
00:53:52.679 --> 00:53:54.398
Don't do that! Okay?

672
00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.675
Will someone say something?

673
00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.710
All right.

674
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.552
I mean, have you ever heard of coincidence?

675
00:54:00.639 --> 00:54:02.552
- Oh, my God!
- That's all this is, Clare.

676
00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:03.755
Coincidence.

677
00:54:04.239 --> 00:54:05.878
Yeah, Clare. I don't know.

678
00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.110
I'm telling you,
I don't think so. I really don't.

679
00:54:08.199 --> 00:54:10.112
You wanna know what I think, Clare?

680
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.831
Yeah.

681
00:54:12.719 --> 00:54:15.188
I think you're a selfish bowl of bitch sauce.

682
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.916
If I had seven wishes,
you know what I'd have done?

683
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.228
I would have wished for world peace

684
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.119
and I would cure cancer.
I mean, you've used four whole wishes.

685
00:54:22.199 --> 00:54:24.032
- Five wishes.
- Five whole wishes already.

686
00:54:24.119 --> 00:54:26.315
And you didn't wish for anything
for me and June.

687
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.277
Nothing. We're your best friends.

688
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:30.273
Come on! Like, you didn't think, like...

689
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.909
"Oh, well, I know Meredith wants
an internship at Everest Games

690
00:54:34.519 --> 00:54:37.318
- and June wants to get into Brown."
- You don't believe in this anyway!

691
00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.039
- So?
- Guys, are you serious?

692
00:54:39.119 --> 00:54:40.190
Do you think that if...

693
00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.871
if I believed this from the very beginning

694
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:46.032
that I wouldn't have wished for my mom to...

695
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.280
over you guys? I...

696
00:54:51.039 --> 00:54:52.759
It's okay. Say it.

697
00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.389
Nothing.

698
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.952
Nothing. I just... I don't...

699
00:54:58.199 --> 00:55:00.192
think that I should be wishing anymore.

700
00:55:01.719 --> 00:55:03.233
I think you should throw it away.

701
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.034
Doesn't that make the most sense?

702
00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:06.440
- Just get rid of it.
- Yeah.

703
00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:11.916
It says if I get rid of it,
all of my wishes will be undone.

704
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.719
But if you really think people have died...

705
00:55:16.239 --> 00:55:18.197
aren't you a bad person if you keep it?

706
00:55:19.199 --> 00:55:22.193
Yeah. By "bad person"
June means, "psycho bitch."

707
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.637
Oh!

708
00:55:23.719 --> 00:55:26.315
Nauseating Norma's outside,
and I'm so over this conversation.

709
00:55:29.239 --> 00:55:30.878
Just throw it away.

710
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.389
You'll feel so much better.

711
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:36.239
I mean, it hasn't really worked.
I still feel miserable.

712
00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:37.829
Toss it and it's done.

713
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.755
You won't have to worry about it anymore.

714
00:56:02.159 --> 00:56:05.231
<i># I been up all night thinkin' #
# 'Bout what we got in store tonight #</i>

715
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.757
<i># It's about to be a celebration #
# Ain't no fakin' #</i>

716
00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:09.795
I'll be right back.

717
00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.711
- I'm gonna get us some cotton candy.
- Okay.

718
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.871
<i># Let you know #</i>

719
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.871
<i># Ain't no fear we letting go #</i>

720
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.396
- Clare, hi.
- Hi.

721
00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:18.994
Check this out.
Junie and I are still alive, dude.

722
00:56:19.079 --> 00:56:20.559
- Go figure, right.
- Okay.

723
00:56:20.639 --> 00:56:23.074
Just ignore her, Clare. So, did you do it?

724
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.989
Did you throw it away?

725
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.914
Yeah, right after you guys left.

726
00:56:30.719 --> 00:56:31.835
- Cool.
- Come on!

727
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.070
Hey, where you guys going?
The hunt's about to start.

728
00:56:34.199 --> 00:56:35.759
Yeah. We'll be right back.

729
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.909
Hurry up.

730
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.719
Okay, be right back.

731
00:56:39.639 --> 00:56:40.789
- Okay.
- Kids, man.

732
00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:44.157
<i># Lightning in the fire #</i>

733
00:56:46.719 --> 00:56:50.429
<i># Somehow it always feels #
# Like the first time #</i>

734
00:56:52.119 --> 00:56:53.759
Wait, hang on. Paul, stop.

735
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.389
Ow.

736
00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.231
What's this?

737
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.231
Nothing.

738
00:57:06.079 --> 00:57:07.514
Let me see your phone.

739
00:57:09.519 --> 00:57:10.795
Now, or I'm out.

740
00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.436
They're just pictures of you.

741
00:57:26.679 --> 00:57:28.193
You're even cute when you're sleeping.

742
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.313
You've been spying on me.

743
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.471
- Well, yeah.
- What is wrong with you?

744
00:57:34.559 --> 00:57:35.710
Are you mad?

745
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.119
Yes, I'm mad.

746
00:57:37.199 --> 00:57:38.918
You're smokin' when you're mad.

747
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.719
I think maybe that we need a break.

748
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.028
I don't.

749
00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:44.634
I was just trying to be nice.

750
00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.797
Paul, I'm breaking up with you.

751
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.431
- I gotta get out of here.
- Clare, wait.

752
00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.836
This isn't over. Clare!

753
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.351
Where is she? It's about to start.

754
00:58:13.519 --> 00:58:14.396
What? No.

755
00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.755
Hey, what happened?

756
00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.434
Junebug almost just got barbecued
and I saved her.

757
00:58:18.519 --> 00:58:19.840
Hey, got ninja, right?

758
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.315
Ow-wah.

759
00:58:23.239 --> 00:58:24.958
Wait, guys. I just got the first clue.

760
00:58:25.039 --> 00:58:26.759
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

761
00:58:32.599 --> 00:58:33.670
Hey, buddy. It's Dad.

762
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.878
I got a gig outside town so
I'm gonna be home around midnight. Okay?

763
00:58:37.519 --> 00:58:38.431
I love you.

764
00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:42.954
Shit!

765
00:58:59.679 --> 00:59:01.159
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

766
00:59:01.239 --> 00:59:02.434
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

767
00:59:02.719 --> 00:59:03.630
Look.

768
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.554
- What goes up, must come down.
- Yes.

769
00:59:06.639 --> 00:59:08.074
You get it? Alright.

770
00:59:08.559 --> 00:59:10.039
Come on, guys, let's get this selfie.

771
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.835
Boom. Five down, five more to go.

772
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.956
Saxon's goin' down tonight.

773
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.960
All right, where to next?

774
00:59:20.039 --> 00:59:20.951
Oh oh oh!

775
00:59:21.199 --> 00:59:23.157
- Holy... ballsack.
- What?

776
00:59:23.239 --> 00:59:24.913
Malformed Molly's in the building.

777
00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:26.871
Twenty-sixth floor. I gotta go.

778
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.150
Are you kidding me?

779
00:59:28.519 --> 00:59:29.920
Don't hate. Don't hate.

780
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.672
Meredith! Come on!

781
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.992
Clare! Just give me five minutes, alright?

782
00:59:34.239 --> 00:59:38.199
And when I'm back,
Monster Mutant Master. Right here.

783
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.755
Dammit.

784
00:59:47.639 --> 00:59:48.550
I didn't do it.

785
00:59:50.199 --> 00:59:51.190
Do what?

786
00:59:53.519 --> 00:59:56.990
The box. I still have it.
I couldn't throw it away.

787
00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.349
That's messed up, Clare.

788
00:59:59.639 --> 01:00:00.550
I know.

789
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.956
I tried, I just... I couldn't do it.

790
01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:41.030
Aw man! I'm the shit!

791
01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:48.431
Great!

792
01:00:50.239 --> 01:00:51.150
Shit.

793
01:01:21.559 --> 01:01:22.835
- Meredith?
- Hey. Um...

794
01:01:23.599 --> 01:01:24.715
Clare, I'm stuck, okay?

795
01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.519
<i>Please get someone to help me.
I'm stuck in this stupid elevator.</i>

796
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.831
Uh...

797
01:01:31.159 --> 01:01:32.309
Yeah, sure.

798
01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:39.471
Argh.

799
01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.550
Crap!

800
01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.715
Hey, um, never mind.

801
01:02:17.159 --> 01:02:18.389
Dammit!

802
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.391
No!

803
01:02:20.199 --> 01:02:22.590
Clare!

804
01:02:22.679 --> 01:02:24.159
Meredith!

805
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.360
Meredith!

806
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.996
Meredith!

807
01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.918
This is your fault.

808
01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.829
All your fault.

809
01:03:18.599 --> 01:03:19.510
Hey, come on.

810
01:03:19.719 --> 01:03:21.438
No.

811
01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.552
Come on. Let's get you outta here.

812
01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:26.990
Come on.

813
01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.110
You know the number on the box
that we couldn't figure out?

814
01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.751
Well, I did.

815
01:03:38.599 --> 01:03:42.474
It's a military ID number belonging to
an airman by the name of Arthur Sands.

816
01:03:42.559 --> 01:03:43.471
That's him.

817
01:03:45.079 --> 01:03:47.469
He was stationed in China
at the end of World War ll.

818
01:03:47.559 --> 01:03:51.110
A few years later he opened up a
very successful car dealership in Jersey.

819
01:03:51.519 --> 01:03:53.751
He lost his best friend in a freak accident.

820
01:03:54.599 --> 01:03:55.476
Here's the kicker.

821
01:03:56.119 --> 01:03:57.190
That's him six months later.

822
01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:58.916
Oh, my God!

823
01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.119
After his suicide,
his wife was institutionalized.

824
01:04:02.519 --> 01:04:04.795
She swore a music box
had destroyed her family.

825
01:04:05.239 --> 01:04:06.514
In the last five years or so...

826
01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.271
the box resurfaced again in Cleveland,
with a man named Lawrence Hart.

827
01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:15.516
<i>He wins the lottery, marries his high
school sweetheart and has two daughters.</i>

828
01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:16.750
<i>A perfect life.</i>

829
01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.152
<i>Until people around him start dying off.</i>

830
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.759
<i>His daughters drowned,
his wife died in a car accident</i>

831
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.152
<i>and Hart lost his mind.</i>

832
01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.876
<i>He barricades himself in his house and
that's where he dies, in a massive fire.</i>

833
01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.231
<i>You know what's weird?</i>

834
01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:39.914
<i>What's left of his estate is
a few blocks from your house, Clare.</i>

835
01:04:47.519 --> 01:04:50.079
There was another phrase on the box
I don't think you saw.

836
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.353
<i>It was a warning.</i>

837
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.916
<i>"After seven wishes,
the</i> Yaoguai <i>claims the soul."</i>

838
01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:07.269
That's its final price.

839
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.800
- Hey.
- What?

840
01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.235
How many wishes have you made?

841
01:05:33.079 --> 01:05:34.514
I've made five wishes.

842
01:05:35.079 --> 01:05:37.036
Jesus, Clare.
What the hell is wrong with you?

843
01:05:37.159 --> 01:05:37.990
I'm sorry, but...

844
01:05:38.119 --> 01:05:40.077
"But" how is there a "but?" People are dead!

845
01:05:40.159 --> 01:05:42.469
It was just nice to be normal for a while.

846
01:05:42.559 --> 01:05:43.391
That's your excuse?

847
01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.675
What'd you wish for, anyway?

848
01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.829
- That nice house?
- No.

849
01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.998
Oh now, bullshit! People are dead, Clare.
You can't just wish that away.

850
01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:50.150
You can't take that back.

851
01:05:50.239 --> 01:05:51.992
I know, and I said I was sorry.

852
01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.036
I didn't know that any of this would happen.

853
01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:54.996
Know what I wish?

854
01:05:55.079 --> 01:05:57.231
I wish I never met you. That's what I wish.

855
01:06:02.639 --> 01:06:06.190
It's my fault.
And I know that I have to get rid of it.

856
01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.512
Will you please help me?

857
01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:13.030
Please, Ryan?

858
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.239
Okay, let's do it.

859
01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.829
Okay.

860
01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:44.230
Bitch!

861
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.119
She was my best friend, Clare.

862
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.469
I'm sorry.

863
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.911
What are you doing here?

864
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.797
Why haven't you answered my texts?

865
01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.472
You need to leave right now.

866
01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.750
What if I said...

867
01:07:39.079 --> 01:07:40.594
I don't want to live without you.

868
01:07:40.679 --> 01:07:41.670
And I don't want you...

869
01:07:42.679 --> 01:07:43.795
to live without me.

870
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.391
Please. Just, just leave.

871
01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.797
- So, we're done?
- Oh, my God!

872
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.311
Yes.

873
01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.309
I love you, Clare.

874
01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.670
Where is it?

875
01:08:10.199 --> 01:08:12.112
What, what do you mean?

876
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.628
I don't know.

877
01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:17.430
It's...

878
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.511
I don't know. It was right there last night.

879
01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.710
It was right in there. I...

880
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.791
Oh...

881
01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:28.235
What does that mean?

882
01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.591
I...

883
01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.796
Maybe it's done with you.

884
01:08:34.079 --> 01:08:35.115
Maybe it's over.

885
01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.479
Well, what now? What would I do? What...

886
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.880
You move on with your life.

887
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.476
You can do it.

888
01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.993
That's easy to say, Ryan.

889
01:08:44.079 --> 01:08:45.752
No, it's easy to wish.

890
01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.274
I liked it. I liked having it.

891
01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.033
It made me feel special.

892
01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.074
Is there anything you wished for
that you can't live without?

893
01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.399
- No.
- See, you don't need it.

894
01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.310
Dad?

895
01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:18.350
What's going on?

896
01:09:24.039 --> 01:09:25.712
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

897
01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:32.960
It's unbelievable. I mean, who forgets
to pay their taxes for ten years?

898
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.832
Your mother's crazy Uncle August.

899
01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.837
Well, here we are.

900
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.353
Home sweet home.

901
01:09:47.239 --> 01:09:53.953
<i># You're a curse #
# A disease, and I caught it #</i>

902
01:09:55.279 --> 01:09:58.556
<i># Like a drug, slowly pulsing #</i>

903
01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.233
Happy birthday, Clare.

904
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.554
<i># And I don't want it anymore #</i>

905
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.840
<i># My feet on the dash, take a drag #</i>

906
01:10:15.319 --> 01:10:18.073
<i># I go round #</i>

907
01:10:19.239 --> 01:10:21.356
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

908
01:10:21.439 --> 01:10:24.751
<i># Wondering why you don't gain #</i>

909
01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.679
<i># I'll stay this way for longest way #</i>

910
01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.920
Recycle first.

911
01:10:36.279 --> 01:10:37.315
Gross.

912
01:10:39.039 --> 01:10:40.554
Mmmm, hot.

913
01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.235
<i># You're going somewhere, #
# You're going nowhere #</i>

914
01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:54.231
<i># They're always telling you, #
# You're going somewhere #</i>

915
01:10:54.319 --> 01:10:58.109
<i># You're going nowhere #</i>

916
01:11:00.399 --> 01:11:04.599
<i># You're going somewhere, #
# You're going nowhere #</i>

917
01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.479
<i># They're always telling you #</i>

918
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:13.556
<i># You're going somewhere, #
# You're going nowhere #</i>

919
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.354
You stole it?

920
01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:35.197
You couldn't get rid of it.
You saw what it did to Meredith.

921
01:11:35.279 --> 01:11:36.793
I'm just trying to protect you, okay?

922
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.792
Okay, so you think that you can control it.

923
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.199
You think you can, Clare?

924
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.791
Really?

925
01:11:43.039 --> 01:11:44.314
Are you crazy?

926
01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.831
Why would you bring it here
in the first place?

927
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.957
'Cause I have two little sisters at home.

928
01:11:49.039 --> 01:11:51.680
Give it back. Right now.

929
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.158
After everything that's happened?

930
01:11:55.479 --> 01:11:56.960
Yes, June.

931
01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.399
What's wrong with you?

932
01:11:59.359 --> 01:12:01.795
No! Clare, no, stop it. Clare!

933
01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.672
You see what it's done. This is a bad idea.

934
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.319
- June, go away.
- Stop, listen to me! Just stop!

935
01:12:06.399 --> 01:12:08.789
Clare, come on! No, no, no. Clare, come here.

936
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.314
- Just give it to me, Clare. Stop.
- Let go, June!

937
01:12:11.399 --> 01:12:13.551
- Let go! Let go!
- Clare?

938
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.875
- Clare!
- No!

939
01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:26.829
June?

940
01:12:30.359 --> 01:12:32.555
June? Is she going to be okay?

941
01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:34.993
What is wrong with you?

942
01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.470
Clare?

943
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.516
- Go away!
- I thought we were done with this.

944
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.590
I'm not ready yet.

945
01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.194
You can't keep it. You know that.

946
01:12:48.279 --> 01:12:49.998
- You have to get rid of it!
- You don't understand.

947
01:12:50.079 --> 01:12:50.990
I'm not ready yet!

948
01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:52.354
What about everything we talked about?

949
01:12:52.439 --> 01:12:53.555
I won't wish anymore, okay?

950
01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.319
Okay, it'll be fine. I just won't wish.

951
01:12:55.399 --> 01:12:56.880
I'm gonna hang on to it for a while.

952
01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.552
Clare, please, you're not hearing yourself.

953
01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.438
You can't control it. It's controlling you!

954
01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.631
Go away! Okay?

955
01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.279
Please go away.

956
01:13:04.399 --> 01:13:08.029
I have two wishes left
and if you do not go away,

957
01:13:08.119 --> 01:13:10.953
I will use one on you,
I swear I'll use it on you.

958
01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.711
Go away!

959
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.559
You can't keep running from this!

960
01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.479
I know, I know what to do.

961
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.030
I know, I know what to do,
I know when to... Okay.

962
01:13:31.399 --> 01:13:32.595
Okay.

963
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.399
If I had... No.

964
01:13:36.399 --> 01:13:40.114
If I just don't make any more wishes,
everything will be fine.

965
01:13:41.119 --> 01:13:44.318
Everything will be fine.

966
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.672
Clare? School just called.

967
01:13:51.439 --> 01:13:53.158
Clare? What's going on?

968
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:54.989
Get down here!

969
01:13:56.479 --> 01:13:57.550
Okay.

970
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.592
I have two wishes left.

971
01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.597
I have two wishes left.

972
01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.631
Two wishes.

973
01:14:11.319 --> 01:14:14.073
I wish my mother never committed suicide.

974
01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.914
Oh, God.

975
01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.430
Clare?

976
01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.750
Mom?

977
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:45.877
Mom?

978
01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.833
I missed you so much!

979
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.037
You missed me so much? What?

980
01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.115
Happy birthday! We got you cake!

981
01:14:58.479 --> 01:15:00.436
- Sssh!
- And presents!

982
01:15:02.279 --> 01:15:05.273
Okay, come on. What's the holdup?
Downstairs, kiddo. Chop-chop.

983
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.716
Al'right. Here it is.

984
01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:12.119
Yay!

985
01:15:14.439 --> 01:15:16.238
<i># Happy birthday... #</i>

986
01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.954
<i># Happy birthday... #</i>

987
01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.359
Happy birthday, kiddo.

988
01:15:24.439 --> 01:15:25.350
Thank you, Dad.

989
01:15:27.319 --> 01:15:28.230
Make a wish.

990
01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.789
Clare?

991
01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:38.395
I'm up here.

992
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.319
Come open your presents.

993
01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.751
Okay.

994
01:16:16.399 --> 01:16:19.154
<i>Mommy! Come on, Max!</i>

995
01:16:47.079 --> 01:16:48.354
This is your fault.

996
01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:52.600
This is your fault. Everything is your fault.

997
01:16:54.119 --> 01:16:55.235
Oh, my God!

998
01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:58.996
What?

999
01:17:08.039 --> 01:17:09.269
No. No!

1000
01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:11.989
Yeah, right there is good.

1001
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.118
- Yeah.
- You think so, man?

1002
01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.795
No, no, no, no!

1003
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.032
Dad! Dad!

1004
01:17:20.119 --> 01:17:21.952
Dad!

1005
01:17:22.039 --> 01:17:23.837
Dad!

1006
01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.956
- Oh, my God! My God!
- No!

1007
01:17:28.319 --> 01:17:29.310
Jon!

1008
01:17:30.239 --> 01:17:31.229
No...

1009
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.475
Argh!

1010
01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.552
- No!
- Are you...

1011
01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.596
What happened? Are you...

1012
01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.114
Jonathan! No!

1013
01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.314
No! No!

1014
01:17:59.319 --> 01:18:01.356
I've got one wish left.

1015
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.877
I know how to beat you!

1016
01:18:06.279 --> 01:18:07.430
I wanna go back!

1017
01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.551
I wanna go back before I got you!

1018
01:18:11.079 --> 01:18:12.195
I wanna go back.

1019
01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.560
My final wish is I wanna go back
to the morning my dad found you.

1020
01:18:18.199 --> 01:18:20.317
I wanna go back right now!

1021
01:18:29.159 --> 01:18:30.435
Max?

1022
01:18:31.319 --> 01:18:32.230
Hi, Max!

1023
01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.479
Mmm... hi.

1024
01:18:35.039 --> 01:18:36.359
Oh, who's a good boy!

1025
01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.676
Wait.

1026
01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.030
Wait, wait, wait. Wait! Wait!

1027
01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.716
Wait! Wait!

1028
01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.792
Wait! Hang on, hang on!

1029
01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.871
<i>I'm not awake right now.</i>

1030
01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.952
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- Nothing. Hi.

1031
01:19:07.039 --> 01:19:09.315
I just wanted to, you know, hear your voice.

1032
01:19:09.399 --> 01:19:12.996
<i>Seriously? You don't need a kidney
or some ridiculous words of wisdom?</i>

1033
01:19:13.079 --> 01:19:14.832
- No, I just, no...
- <i>Alright, you know</i>

1034
01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.957
- <i>I'm gonna go back to sleep, okay? Night!</i>
- Okay, okay.

1035
01:19:19.239 --> 01:19:20.275
Dad!

1036
01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.949
- Hey!
- Hey. What's all this?

1037
01:19:25.039 --> 01:19:29.514
Um, nothing. I just... um I was just
wondering if I could go with you guys.

1038
01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.954
You know, like old times.

1039
01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:34.153
- Yeah. Get in.
- Awesome.

1040
01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.109
Sure, it'll be like old times.
Be our good luck charm.

1041
01:19:39.079 --> 01:19:40.719
Aw, you look so nice.

1042
01:20:26.279 --> 01:20:27.555
Clare, you find anything?

1043
01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.868
I found...

1044
01:20:30.119 --> 01:20:32.760
I found these. I don't know
what you could use them for.

1045
01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.909
Maybe around the house?
I don't know, they're kind of neat.

1046
01:20:37.119 --> 01:20:38.997
- Yeah, I can do something with these.
- Yeah?

1047
01:20:39.079 --> 01:20:41.037
Hey, Carl. Check it out.

1048
01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.039
Told you my kid has an eye.

1049
01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.118
You always were my good luck charm.

1050
01:20:47.199 --> 01:20:48.155
You gotta come with us again.

1051
01:20:49.359 --> 01:20:50.270
Yeah, maybe I will.

1052
01:20:51.119 --> 01:20:53.760
I have to get to school,
but have fun today. Love you.

1053
01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.751
Love you too, buddy.

1054
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.359
- Yeah, thank you so much.
- You got it.

1055
01:21:09.359 --> 01:21:10.680
Let's go buddy.

1056
01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.953
Ryan! Ryan, hey.

1057
01:21:17.159 --> 01:21:19.550
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, sure.

1058
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.989
Okay, um...

1059
01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:24.032
First off, I just wanted to say, um...

1060
01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.029
I'm sorry for the whole McFarts thing.

1061
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.876
Wait. What? Really?

1062
01:21:29.239 --> 01:21:30.560
Yeah. Um...

1063
01:21:31.039 --> 01:21:33.953
But you know what, maybe in the
multiverse, that didn't happen.

1064
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.474
- Hold on, you dig on multiverses?
- Yeah.

1065
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.951
And, also, maybe in the multiverse,
we're really good friends.

1066
01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.711
Maybe... we're even dating.

1067
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.636
Well... have we done it?

1068
01:21:48.439 --> 01:21:49.475
No, not yet.

1069
01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.470
I have also met your cousin, Gina.
Hung out in her loft and everything.

1070
01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.911
Okay, you're freaking me out right now.

1071
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:58.989
Yeah, good.

1072
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:00.954
'Cause I need a favor.

1073
01:22:02.199 --> 01:22:04.192
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy but...

1074
01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:07.913
please don't open this.

1075
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.673
Just... just bury it. No shortcuts.

1076
01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.559
Uh... okay.

1077
01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.789
What's in it for me?

1078
01:22:18.239 --> 01:22:19.435
Dinner, if you want?

1079
01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:23.073
And maybe we could talk more
on this whole multiverse thing?

1080
01:22:25.039 --> 01:22:29.033
Yeah, and you can tell me how you
know my cousin and that she has a loft.

1081
01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.994
- Done.
- Cool.

1082
01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.591
Dude!

1083
01:22:46.199 --> 01:22:47.110
I'll see you around.

1084
01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.948
I didn't see her.

1085
01:23:05.399 --> 01:23:06.800
I just didn't see her.
