Mommy!

2
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.880
- Mommy!
- Clare.

3
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.670
Mommy!

4
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.910
How far can I go?

5
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.390
Just down the street and back.

6
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.470
- You gonna visit the nest for me?
- Yes!

7
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.870
Okay.

8
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.470
Go on, big girl.

9
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.710
Whee!

10
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.540
Come on, Max.

11
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.540
Come on, Max.

12
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.140
Come on!

13
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.900
Come on, boy!

14
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.000
Max, come on!

15
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.740
Momma?

16
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.500
Daddy?

17
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.520
Momma?

18
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.760
Morning!

19
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.360
Aw, you look so nice.

20
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.320
- Bye!
- Bye, Mrs. Deluca.

Yeah!

32
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.040
Hi, Uncle August.

33
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.840
- No, I'll get the paper.
- Thank you, Clare.

Go get off the road, winner!

36
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.400
I'm trying to drive here!

37
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.720
Ow!

38
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.000
Oh, gosh...

39
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.320
Are you alright?

40
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.560
Yeah, you know. It's...

41
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.970
it's Monday.

42
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.840
Here you go.

43
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.410
- Thanks
- Yeah.

44
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.680
See you around.

45
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.000
I'll check these. See if there's...

46
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.160
You've gotta be kidding me.

47
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.160
Come on!

48
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.600
Check it out.

49
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.160
Dad!

50
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.480
You serious?

51
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.680
What'd I do now?

52
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.280
You promised
that you wouldn't do this at my school.

53
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.080
We're not at your school.

54
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.440
We're across the street from your school.

55
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.600
Yeah, but people can still see you.

56
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.760
Well, who the hell's watching?

57
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.680
Yeah, her dad's a dumpster driver.

58
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.090
Hey, what happened there?

59
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.480
I fell at Uncle August's house,
he saw the whole thing.

60
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.920
What did I tell you
about talking to Uncle August?

61
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.960
You said not to. But I really don't see why.

62
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.560
Dad, you're killing me, okay?

63
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.000
Hey!

64
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.560
Come on, let's roll out, Shannon.

65
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.080
Thank you.

66
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.800
<i># You get so excited by the prospect #</i>

67
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.080

69
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.680
So...

70
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.000
what do you guys think?

71
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.920
So good.

72
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.800
- How long it take you?
- Ah, yeah, like weeks.

73
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.720
Clare, you try way too hard, dude.

74
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.640
Jesus, it's better than not trying at all.

75
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.840
- Will you guys help me hang it?
- I got you.

76
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.480
Yeah, just give me one sec.

77
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.120
What is she doing?

78
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.920
It's called <i>Monster Mutant Slayer.</i>

79
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.600
Dumbest game ever.

80
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.520
Hey! Don't mock
what you don't understand dude, okay?

81
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.560
If I kill Lurching Louisa and Hacked-Up Harry

82
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.000
I level up to Mutant Killer.

83
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.560
And if I get Malformed Molly,
I'm a Monster Mutant Master, man!

84
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.130
I know. Awesome? Yes.

85
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.680
Got it.

86
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.680
- Stop!
- Sorry. Don't mind him.

87
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.880
My bad.

88
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.370
Seriously? Bird ass!

89
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.440
Recycle first.

90
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.320
Hey, Clare.

91
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.920
I liked your banner.

92
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.280
Yeah, I liked it too.

93
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.000
Hey, Carl!

94
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.000
Look at this!

95
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.610
That would fetch a ton at the swap.

96
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.400
I have a better idea.

97
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.010
- Jesus, what's...
- It's so bad.

98
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:25.800
Put it away.

99
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.930
I mean she's seriously smeggy.

100
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.120
Like ultimate smeggy.

101
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.680
- I know!
- What was that?

102
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:31.680
Um...

103
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.440
nothing. No.

104
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.640
Um. Mm. But you were laughing.

105
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.880
Which is co-signing.

106
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.160
And we wanna know
what you were laughing about.

107
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.640
Go ahead.

108
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.160
Everyone's listening.

109
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:45.880
Okay.

110
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.560
Clare, come on.

111
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.130
Go Clare. Yeah, do it.

112
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.040
What's so funny, winner?

113
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:53.650
Yeah, what's funny...

114
00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.400
is that you're smegma.

115
00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.640
But like...

116
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.360
ultimate smegma.

117
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.840
What does that even mean?

118
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.160
- Oh, Clare. I got it.
- Well..

119
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.280
Thank you.

120
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.720
Yeah, this is great. Um...

121
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.920
Smegma. It's a noun.

122
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.480
"A malodorous, opaque,
white or yellow substance

123
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:21.320
produced by the sebaceous glands
of male and female genitalia."

124
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:24.620
Oh, I... I...

125
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.380
I'm so sorry. Would you like me to define
"ultimate" for you?

126
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.540
Oooh!

127
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.620
Come on. Yeah.

128
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.380
You got it, Clare!

129
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.340
Get up! Get up!

130
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.500
Beat her up, Clare!

131
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.980
Drop her like a red-headed baby
fresh out of the vagina!

132
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.900
Get away from her! Let her go!

133
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.540
Ooh!

134
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.300
Son of a bitch! Get back here!

135
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.020
What's in it?

136
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.100
It's broccoli, apple, lemon and ginger.

137
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.820
'Cause we don't want you to bruise.

138
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.180
You know what you need.

139
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.980
Please don't say it. Please.

140
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.460
A nice boy.

141
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.020
- You said it.
- Or a nice girl.

142
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.460
Come on, come on, come on.

143
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.540
You must like someone.

144
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.540
I do, but...

145
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.930
So what's his or her name?

146
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.500
Paul.

147
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.460
I think he said hi to me once.

148
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.700
Well, that's something.

149
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.580
In the fifth grade.

150
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.940
Hi, Max.

151
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.180
Hey.

152
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.340
There you go.

153
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.580
Man, you got the green stuff.

154
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.780
It's called "salad".

155
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.340
It's healthy and you're welcome.

156
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.980
I got you a little something, buddy.

157
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.100
It's up on your bed.

158
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.910
Dad, please...
we've talked about this already.

159
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.900
You've your space

160
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.500
- and then there's my space.
- I know!

161
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.060
I just found it at this fancy place.
It's got Chinese writing on it.

162
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.820
Figured since you're taking Chinese...

163
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.620
If you don't want it, Carl'll take it.

164
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.060
Shit, you're damn right.

165
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.340
Just consider it an early birthday present.

166
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.750
Come on, Max.

167
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.660
Whoa!

168
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.340
"Wishes...

169
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.420

<i># And a little part, #

176
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.100
Of course that would happen.

177

Why not?

181
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.580
I wish that...

182
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.420
Darcie Chapman,

183
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.700
would just...

184
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.460
I don't know, but just, like, go rot!

185
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.020
Max?

186
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.860
Come on! Come here!

187
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.420
Okay.

188
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.220
Oh, my God!

189
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.340
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

190
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.540
Oh, my God!

191
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.470
Oh, my God.

192
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.460
Oh, my God!

193
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:04.900
Darcie?

194
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.060
Darcie!

195
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.660
Oh! Ah!

196
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.500
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

197
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.460
Necrotizing fasciitis.

198
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:15.650
- No!
- Yeah.

199
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.700
- What?
- Yeah.

200
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.620
So apparently, She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

201
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.380
picked up a case of it at the spa.

202
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.740
And now she's at the ICU.

203
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.300
She might lose her toes, part
of her leg, and part of her face.

204
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.870
How sweet is that?

205
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.060
Ah, she's rotting!

206
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.060
Yeah.

207
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.180
Apparently Karma is a bigger bitch
than Darcie Chapman.

208
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.300
Who knew?

209
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.660
Oh!

210
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.580
- It's for Darcie.
- Oh!

211
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.820
You said that like we should care.

212
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.500
Um, we're starting a GoFundMe.

213
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:47.460
Go fund this.

214
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.420
Yeah.

215
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.820
- Go on. Scooch. Bye.
- It's fine. It's fine.

216
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.860
- Meredith.
- It's whatever.

217
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.220
- Oh, my God!
- You're proud.

218
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.900
- I gotta go.
- All right.

219
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.700
Definitely have my attention, lucky box.

220
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.990
Max, come here.

221
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.900
Max?

222
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.740
Max?

223
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.180
Where are you?

224
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.500
Max?

225
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.020
Ma...

226
00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.580
Max, are you in there? Buddy?

227
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.020
Buddy?

228
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.380
You in there?

229
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.020
You know you're not supposed to be down here.

230
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.820
Ow.

231
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.980
Max?

232
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.150
He was a good dog.

233
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.280
Mom gave him to me.

234
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.020
I know, buddy.

235
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.190
But the majority of the characters
are written in Ancient Chinese.

236
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.990
If you want an accurate translation,
you'll probably have to talk to a scholar.

237
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.710
- Got it. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

238
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.950
My cousin could hook it up.

239
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.070
Ancient Chinese is her thing.

240
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.200
She'd help you out, for a price.

241
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.830
I don't really have any money.

242
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.990
Who said anything about money?

243
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.070
He'll take a tit pic.

244
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.070
- Uh...
- And so will I.

245
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.550
- What?
- Um...

246
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.590
Never mind.

247
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.590
Sorry.

248
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.710
Offer still stands if you change your mind.

249
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.830
- Dude, seriously?
- Just kidding.

250
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.950
<i>Hey guys, do you feel that?</i>

251
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.030
It's like the darkness has been lifted

252
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.390
ever since Bitchface-Since-Birth
left the building.

253
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.950
I heard they had to amputate
a few of her toes.

254
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.510
Sweet.

255
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.550
Guys, we shouldn't be happy about this.

256
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.350
Clare, I never said I was happy.

257
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.070
I'm freaking ecstatic, man!

258
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.480
Almost like being here.

259
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.600
<i># Laying me down #</i>

260
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.270
<i># Down on the floor #</i>

261
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.470
<i># Waiting for a song to play #</i>

262
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.870

263
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.630
<i># I love when you say my name #</i>

264
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.830
<i># Tell me, tell me why #</i>

265
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.670
<i># Were you trying to hide #
# From the fallout? #</i>

266
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.910
<i># Someone tell me why #
# I'm on the other side #</i>

267
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.950
<i># Is it countdown? #</i>

268
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.230
<i># I'll wait up with you #
# I'll stay up #</i>

269
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.830
I wish that

270
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:21.150
Paul Middlebrook
would fall madly in love with me.

271
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.710
<i># I'll wait up with you #
# I'll stay up with you #</i>

272
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.110

273
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.910
<i># You give it all, you take it back #</i>

274
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.780
<i># Why's it gotta feel so right? #</i>

275
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.590
Oh!

276
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.870
Hey.

277
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.750
Hey.

278
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.110
- Paul?
- Yeah.

279
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.670
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

280
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.790
- So I...
- Bell ringing.

281
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.150
I'll see you around Claire.

282
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.230
Yep!

283
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.070
Oh, my God. Oh, My God.

284
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.770
<i>And now, this news just coming in.</i>

285
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.090
- <i>A local resident...</i>
- Hey.

286
00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.690
<i>...owner of the iconic
glass house estate in Gates Mills</i>

287
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.100
- What's going on?
- <i>August Anderson,</i>

288
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.330
<i>was found deceased
in his residence this afternoon.</i>

289
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.370
Are we going to the funeral?

290
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.730
Hey, as far as I'm concerned, good riddance.

291
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.780
What's gonna happen to all of his stuff?

292
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.540
If there's a will, trust me, we ain't in it.

293
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.450
Yeah.

294
00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.530
Course not.

295
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.290
Ow! Dammit, Dad! Come on!

296
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.850
- What?
- We don't have room for all of this crap!

297
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.160
Hey, hey, hey.

298
00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.610
- What?
- I'm going to use those.

299
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.450
What do you need these for, huh?

300
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.530
Dad, seriously.
You can't get rid of anything!

301
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.530
What would Mom say, huh?

302
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.930
Dad.

303
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.000
Dad! Are you listening to... God!

304
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.490
You never listen to anything I say!

305
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.560
Come on.

306
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.370
I wish...

307
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.330
I wish that Uncle August
would leave me everything.

308
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.490
So there.

309
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.610
God, Clare, you're so stupid.

310
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.450
Uh, thank you for calling.

311
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.530
What's going on, Dad?

312
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.690
You're never gonna believe this.

313
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:25.930
What?

314
00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.730
Apparently, you weren't cut out of his will.

315
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.780
How much do we get?

316
00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.050
All of it, buddy.

317
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.450
No way.

318
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.970
Yes... way.

319
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:49.290
Yes!

320
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.050
Yes! Yes! What?

321
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.090
Yes!

322
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.410
You're gonna...

323
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.410
- take the sax with us?
- Why not?

324
00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.340
No, you just you haven't played since mom...

325
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.850
You never know.

326
00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.370
I'm so happy for you.

327
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.170
Sweetheart.

328
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.330
Come visit, or you'll hurt my feelings.

329
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.570
- Of course.
- Okay.

330
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.250
- Dad?
- Down here, bud.

331
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.010
- What are you waiting for? Get in!
- Okay, okay, okay.

332
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.700
Oh, my God!

333
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.050
Call the girls.

334
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.220
<i># 'Cause all we ever wanted #
# Was to feel like this #</i>

335
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.260

<i># All we ever wanted #</i>

339
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.810
Um, Clare, that thing is,
like, eight hundred dollars.

340
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.930
I know.

341
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.690
Yeah, so if you buy it, you're an asshole.

342
00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.890
Totally.

343
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.570
You want one?

344
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.490
No! Wait, I'm not that psycho shallow,
dude. Come on.

345
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.130
June?

346
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.690
I love you. You're my bestest friend ever.

347
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.210
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

348
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.250
Damn!

349
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.130
Peer pressure.

350
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.130
<i># All we ever wanted #
# Was to feel like this #</i>

351
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.570
Out of the way, peasants.

352
00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.410
<i># ... we ever wanted #

353

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.770
- Bye, guys!
- Bye!

356
00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.990
I found something you might like.

357
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

358
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.590
They're your mother's.

359
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.390
I found them when I was packing up our stuff.

360
00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.290
I forgot how good she was.

361
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.490
Where do you think you get it from?

362
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.010
Some of these are so happy.

363
00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.350
So was she.

364
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.390
Why do you think she did it?

365
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.580
Buddy, I've been asking myself that
every single day for the last 12 years.

366
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.620
Still don't have an answer.

367
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.940
Do you think I'm like her?

368
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.210
Course you are.

369
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.100
No, no, no, sweetie, no.

370
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.020
Not like that.

371
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:35.020
What I mean is, you're smart and funny,
you don't take people's crap.

372
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.900
Well, statistically, if you have a parent
that committed suicide...

373
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.710
Clare, she was a good woman,
but she had a rough childhood.

374
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.660
And secrets, honey.

375
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.020
I think that...

376
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.500
I think maybe...

377
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.180
her secrets were too big to live with and...

378
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.820
it was easier to just let go.

379
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.510
I'm sorry. Come here.

380
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.430
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just not into it any more.

381
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.300
It's not you... It's just...

382
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.430
Are you breaking up with me?

383
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.300
I can't date someone
I don't have feelings for.

384
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:37.260
Right.

385
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:38.540
Right.

386
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.100
Oh!

387
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:53.860
Oh!

388
00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.620
So, will you?

389
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:57.700
Will I, what?

390
00:33:58.790 --> 00:33:59.700
Go out with me?

391
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:01.380
Look...

392
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.460
I know this is short notice but

393
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.270
Senior Scavenge is coming up,
I thought it would be fun if we went.

394
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.500
Paul, you just broke up with your girlfriend.

395
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:13.340
Plus, I already have a team... but thank you.

396
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.470
But, we can still go.

397
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:18.540
Yeah, I'll think about it.

398
00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.180
Yeah.

399
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.590
Oh! Um...

400
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.420
I'll see you around.

401
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.980
Nice.

402
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.460
Whoo!

403
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:57.340
- That's it.
- Ryan!

404
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:58.260
What's the price?

405
00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.260
Of?

406
00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.380
Your cousin helping me translate something.

407
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.020
Ah... well.

408
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.740
She's a slut for wontons.

409
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:07.780
Oh?

410
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:08.900
Done, yeah.

411
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.940
- When can we go?
- Let's go right now!

412
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:12.460
Awesome.

413
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.700
<i># Baby, I was so sad #</i>

414
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.660
<i># Stuck on the couch #</i>

415
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.780
So... I'm waiting.

416
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.020
For?

417
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.460
An apology. Been waiting for years.

418
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.300
What did I do?

419
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:31.580
First grade. Sharing circle. You farted.

420
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:32.890
I did not fart!

421
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:35.060
You farted and you blamed it on me

422
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.100
and everyone called me McFarts
until, like, the sixth grade.

423
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:39.780
I'm sorry.

424
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.740
Are you really?

425
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:44.340
Yeah.

426
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.260
Then apology accepted.

427
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.140
But maybe in the multiverse,
it never happened.

428
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.820
Or it did happen and you farted,

429
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.300
blamed it on me and I got called McFarts.

430
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:57.700
Wait.

431
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:58.980
You dig on multiverses?

432
00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:03.150
Yeah, I mean, the theory that,
you know, another you exists

433
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.300
in different circumstances

434
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.540
under different planes of reality,
yada, yada, yada.

435
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:08.860
Yeah, I dig.

436
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.660
Well, maybe in the multiverse,
neither of us farted.

437
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.270
Maybe we're even dating.

438
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.380
Maybe.

439
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.100
Maybe not.

440
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:29.580
Hey, Gina, it's me. Let me up.

441
00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.060
This.

442
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:36.700
Bitchin'.

443
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.180
Yeah, I don't know anything about it.

444
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:40.180
And I can't...

445
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.860
I can't really read what it says, but...

446
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.270
Can you open it?

447
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:49.700
Well, it looks like a
version of a Chinese Wish Pot.

448
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.860
They're pretty common actually.

449
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.100
You take a piece of paper,
write down your wish,

450
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:56.220
put it in the pot,
and wait for it to come true.

451
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.020
Let's see. This one.

452
00:36:58.830 --> 00:36:59.900
It's heavy.

453
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.380
Okay, it promises to grant seven wishes.

454
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:04.340
And there are rules.

455
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.060
"Lay your hands upon me."

456
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.460
I guess you have to be touching it
to make a wish?

457
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.740
"Abandon, lose, or sell me
and all your wishes will be undone."

458
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:17.980
Huh.

459
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.780
Yeah, and what does... What does this say?

460
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.100
That is not a word. It's a name.

461
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:25.620
"Lu Mei"?

462
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.980
"The legend of Lu Mei."

463
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.740
"In 1910, bubonic plague swept through
mainland China.

464
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.670
Lu Mei and her family were suspected
of being infected

465
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.860
so they were quarantined in a train car

466
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.740
where they died of heat stroke
and dehydration.

467
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.700
Lu Mei was the only survivor.

468
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.060
Local legend says she took the only
valuable thing the family owned,

469
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.740
a music box, and went to a temple
to pray for revenge.

470
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.620
She prayed for seven days and seven nights

471
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.380
and on the seventh night,
a <i>Yaoguai</i> answered."

472
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.380
<i>"Yaoguai"</i>?

473
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.540
A demon of the Chinese persuasion.

474
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:06.620
If you believe in that sort of thing.

475
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:13.860
It says, "Lu Mei became very wealthy
and her enemies were vanquished.

476
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.420
In 1922, she died.

477
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.420
Suicide.

478
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:18.860
Opium."

479
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:20.300
Romantic.

480
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.500
So...

481
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.340
what do these numbers mean on the bottom?

482
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.110
I have no idea.

483
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:26.340
A mystery.

484
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.610
Um... It also says,

485
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.780
"When the music ends..."

486
00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:33.780
something happens.

487
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.220
Like?

488
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:37.900
I don't know.
It could be a few different things but

489
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.020
my guy Mike at UWA, he's pretty smart, so

490
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.060
I will let you know what he says.

491
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.750
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

492
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.580
- Here, get this.
- Thanks.

493
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.180
All right. Well, me and my 'tons
need some time alone.

494
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:53.220
I prefer to destroy them in private.

495
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.380
Need anything else?

496
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:56.100
- No. We're out.
- Cool.

497
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.500
- It was great to meet you.
- You too.

498
00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.780
Thanks.

499
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:03.740
Hey, hey.

500
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.740
She's cute. Ask her out.

501
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:07.910
I'm trying.

502
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.300
Good luck.

503
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.660
- Bye!
- Bye.

504
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.100
Aww.

505
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.110
Mmmm... Yum!

506

<i># Drive... #</i>

507
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:25.700
What's up?

508
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.590
Nothing. I just...
I feel like Lu Mei's box...

509
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.140
- God!
- Whoa.

510
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.410
Good stuff in here.

511
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.140
Dad, what are you doing?

512
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:35.830
Wha... What are you talking about?

513
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:38.220
I'm just hanging out with Carl,
picking up some stuff.

514
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.140
Dad, we live in a fricking mansion.
What else do you need?

515
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:42.300
Clare.

516
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.980
- It's not a big...
- No, forget about it.

517

518

519
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.830
You didn't see that.

520
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.620
No. Totally didn't see your dad
digging through the trash at all.

521
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.660
I wish that my Dad would just...

522
00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:17.740
just stop being so embarrassing.

523

528
00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:57.260
Great.

529
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.740
You gotta be kidding me.

530
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.940
Ryan.

531
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.460
Can I say something totally inappropriate?

532
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.990
Sure, go for it.

533
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.500
Your dad is, like...

534
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.860
serious hot sauce.

535
00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.740
Like Sriracha hot.

536
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:59.620
Yes!

I got that translation for you and...

539
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.380
it's messed up.

540
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.180
Fuck! Um...

541
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.940
it's so messed up,
it's actually beginning to freak me out.

542
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:19.420
So, ah, call me back
as soon as you can and...

543
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.250
Hey, Gina, it's me. Let me up.

544
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.360
Hello?

545
00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:58.920
Gina!

546
00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:01.040
Gina!

547
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.830
Gina?

548
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.250
No. No, no, no, no!

549
00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.170
Fuck!

550
00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:14.810
Oh, my God!

551
00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.870
- Oh, hey. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

552
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.750
- I'm well. Where you going?
- Um...

553
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.110
just the class that we're in together.

554
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.760
Oh, yeah. Duh! I'll walk you there.

555
00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.470
Sounds great. Thanks.

556
00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.830
- Clare!
- Oh, hey, I'll see you at class.

557
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.550
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Ryan, where have you been?

558
00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.590
Is everything okay?

559
00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.630
Can I ask you something?
It's gonna sound so...

560
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.710
stupid and so crazy but, um...

561
00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.390
You know that wish box your dad got you?

562
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.830
Have you made any wishes?

563
00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.350
- What? Why?
- So, have you wished?

564
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.510
Why do you keep asking me that?

565
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.510
Why don't you answer?

566
00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.200
Has it played any music yet?

567
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.500
Ryan, who cares? I...

568
00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.590
"A blood price."

569
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.750
That phrase Gina couldn't quite translate.

570
00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:57.750
It says...

571
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.150
"When the music ends,
the blood price is paid."

572
00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.060
Um...

573
00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.310
tell her I said thanks.

574
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.950
What? What is it?

575
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.190
Ah, she's, uh...

576
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.590
She's dead, Clare.

577
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.270
Oh, my God!

578
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.070
I'm so sorry. When did...

579
00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.550
A few nights ago.

580
00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.190
I don't even know what to say...

581
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.670
Did it play its music then?

582
00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.510
I don't know what you're talking about.

583
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.280
How'd you get to live in that mansion, again?

584
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.470
We're gonna be late for class, Ryan.
Are you coming?

585
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.790
Have you?

586
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.350
Clare!

587
00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.990
<i>We're going to be studying
southern China, the area of Guangzhou.</i>

588
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.190
<i>First we're going to start
with the northernmost state...</i>

589
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.630
Clare!

590
00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.750
Come join us.

591
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.030
- Um, Paul...
- Okay.

592
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.390
Oh, did that just happen?

593
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.550
I think so.

594
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.190
- Oh, oh.
- Oh! Burn.

595
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.600
Still a nobody.

596
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.230
How's it feel, winner?

597
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.990
We're outta here.

598
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.710
Haters gonna hate.

599
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.470
There's not much you can do about it.

600
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.590
I wish that I was
the most popular girl in school.

601
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.790
Yeah. That'd be awesome.

602

614
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.470
- Where?
- Senior Scavenge.

615
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.990
- Yes.
- Finally. Say it again.

616
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.110
Yes.

617
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.750
- What?
- Nothing.

618
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.830
I was trying to think of something
dope to say before I kissed you.

619
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.380
That wasn't it.

620
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.230
<i># This path is difficult we travel on #</i>

625
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.910
Hey!

626
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.910
Hey! Wait, hey!

627
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.470
Hello?

628
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.990
Who are you?

629
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.150
Hello?

630
00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.110
- Clare.
- Oh!

631
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.520
What's going on?

632
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.660
Nothing. I just...

633
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.710
Um...

634
00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.270
I think that someone's following me.

635
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.710
- What? Since when?
- Um...

636
00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.990
Since I got the music box.

637
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.670
Mrs. Deluca, are you home? It's Clare.

638
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.910
Mrs. Deluca?

639
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.310
Ugh!

640
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.150
Hello?

641
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.350
Hey. What's up?

642
00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.790
- So cute.
- Beyond cute.

643
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.510
I don't know, Clare.

644
00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.710
Why don't you go ask your new friends?

645
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:35.790
I mean, seriously, I don't get it.

646
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.830
Why is everyone so into you lately?

647
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.230
You're not that special.

648
00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.550
Truth.

649
00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.310
Hey.

650
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.310
What's wrong?

651
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.270
I need to talk to you guys about something.

652
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.910
I don't know what's going on and...

653
00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.910
I don't know what to do.

654
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.350
This is it?

655
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.870
Don't... kick... that!

656
00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.670
Don't do that! Okay?

657
00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.950
Will someone say something?

658
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:08.990
All right.

659
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.830
I mean, have you ever heard of coincidence?

660
00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.830
- Oh, my God!
- That's all this is, Clare.

661
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.030
Coincidence.

662
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.150
Yeah, Clare. I don't know.

663
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:18.390
I'm telling you,
I don't think so. I really don't.

664
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.390
You wanna know what I think, Clare?

665
00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.110
Yeah.

666
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.460
I think you're a selfish bowl of bitch sauce.

667
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.190
If I had seven wishes,
you know what I'd have done?

668
00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.500
I would have wished for world peace

669
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.390
and I would cure cancer.
I mean, you've used four whole wishes.

670
00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.310
- Five wishes.
- Five whole wishes already.

671
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.590
And you didn't wish for anything
for me and June.

672
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.550
Nothing. We're your best friends.

673
00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.550
Come on! Like, you didn't think, like...

674
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.190
"Oh, well, I know Meredith wants
an internship at Everest Games

675
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.590
- and June wants to get into Brown."
- You don't believe in this anyway!

676
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.310
- So?
- Guys, are you serious?

677
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.470
Do you think that if...

678
00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.150
if I believed this from the very beginning

679
00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.310
that I wouldn't have wished for my mom to...

680
00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.560
over you guys? I...

681
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:03.030
It's okay. Say it.

682
00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.670
Nothing.

683
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:07.230
Nothing. I just... I don't...

684
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.470
think that I should be wishing anymore.

685
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.510
I think you should throw it away.

686
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.310
Doesn't that make the most sense?

687
00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.720
- Just get rid of it.
- Yeah.

688
00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.190
It says if I get rid of it,
all of my wishes will be undone.

689
00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.990
But if you really think people have died...

690
00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.470
aren't you a bad person if you keep it?

691
00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.470
Yeah. By "bad person"
June means, "psycho bitch."

692
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:33.910
Oh!

693
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.590
Nauseating Norma's outside,
and I'm so over this conversation.

694
00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.150
Just throw it away.

695
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.670
You'll feel so much better.

696
00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.510
I mean, it hasn't really worked.
I still feel miserable.

697
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.110
Toss it and it's done.

698
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.030
You won't have to worry about it anymore.

699

- Hi.

706
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.270
Check this out.
Junie and I are still alive, dude.

707
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.840
- Go figure, right.
- Okay.

708
00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:33.350
Just ignore her, Clare. So, did you do it?

709
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.270
Did you throw it away?

710
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.190
Yeah, right after you guys left.

711
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.110
- Cool.
- Come on!

Yeah. We'll be right back.

Hurry up.

715
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.990
Okay, be right back.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.670
Ow.

721
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:12.510
What's this?

722
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.510
Nothing.

723
00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.790
Let me see your phone.

724
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.070
Now, or I'm out.

725
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.710
They're just pictures of you.

726
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.470
You're even cute when you're sleeping.

727
00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.590
You've been spying on me.

728
00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.750
- Well, yeah.
- What is wrong with you?

729
00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.990
Are you mad?

730
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.400
Yes, I'm mad.

731
00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.190
You're smokin' when you're mad.

732
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.990
I think maybe that we need a break.

733
00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.300
I don't.

734
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.910
I was just trying to be nice.

735
00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.070
Paul, I'm breaking up with you.

736
00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.710
- I gotta get out of here.
- Clare, wait.

737
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.110
This isn't over. Clare!

738
00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.630
Where is she? It's about to start.

739
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.670
What? No.

740
00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.030
Hey, what happened?

741
00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.710
Junebug almost just got barbecued
and I saved her.

742
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.120
Hey, got ninja, right?

743
00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.590
Ow-wah.

744
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.230
Wait, guys. I just got the first clue.

745
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.030
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, let's go.

746
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.950
Hey, buddy. It's Dad.

747
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.150
I got a gig outside town so
I'm gonna be home around midnight. Okay?

748
00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.710
I love you.

749
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.230
Shit!

750
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.440
- Come on.
- Are you sure?

751
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.710
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

752
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:13.910
Look.

753
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.830
- What goes up, must come down.
- Yes.

754
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.350
You get it? Alright.

755
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.320
Come on, guys, let's get this selfie.

756
00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.110
Boom. Five down, five more to go.

757
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:28.230
Saxon's goin' down tonight.

758
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.240
All right, where to next?

759
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.230
Oh oh oh!

760
00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.430
- Holy... ballsack.
- What?

761
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.190
Malformed Molly's in the building.

762
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.150
Twenty-sixth floor. I gotta go.

763
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.430
Are you kidding me?

764
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.200
Don't hate. Don't hate.

765
00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.950
Meredith! Come on!

766
00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.270
Clare! Just give me five minutes, alright?

767
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:48.480
And when I'm back,
Monster Mutant Master. Right here.

768
00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.030
Dammit.

769
00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:58.830
I didn't do it.

770
00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.470
Do what?

771
00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:07.270
The box. I still have it.
I couldn't throw it away.

772
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.630
That's messed up, Clare.

773
00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.830
I know.

774
00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.230
I tried, I just... I couldn't do it.

775
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.310
Aw man! I'm the shit!

776
00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.710
Great!

777
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.430
Shit.

778
01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.110
- Meredith?
- Hey. Um...

779
01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.990
Clare, I'm stuck, okay?

780
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.800
<i>Please get someone to help me.
I'm stuck in this stupid elevator.</i>

781
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.110
Uh...

782
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.590
Yeah, sure.

783
01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:49.750
Argh.

784
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.830
Crap!

785
01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.490
Hey, um, never mind.

786
01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.160
Dammit!

787
01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.170
No!

788
01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.370
Clare!

789
01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.940
Meredith!

790
01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.140
Meredith!

791
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:39.770
Meredith!

792
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:11.440
This is your fault.

793
01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:15.360
All your fault.

794
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:24.040
Hey, come on.

795
01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:25.960
No.

796
01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:29.080
Come on. Let's get you outta here.

797
01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:31.520
Come on.

798
01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:40.640
You know the number on the box
that we couldn't figure out?

799
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:42.280
Well, I did.

800
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:47.000
It's a military ID number belonging to
an airman by the name of Arthur Sands.

801
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:48.000
That's him.

802
01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:52.000
He was stationed in China
at the end of World War ll.

803
01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:55.640
A few years later he opened up a
very successful car dealership in Jersey.

804
01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:58.280
He lost his best friend in a freak accident.

805
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:00.000
Here's the kicker.

806
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:01.720
That's him six months later.

807
01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:03.440
Oh, my God!

808
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:06.650
After his suicide,
his wife was institutionalized.

809
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:09.320
She swore a music box
had destroyed her family.

810
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:11.040
In the last five years or so...

811
01:03:11.490 --> 01:03:14.800
the box resurfaced again in Cleveland,
with a man named Lawrence Hart.

812
01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:20.040
<i>He wins the lottery, marries his high
school sweetheart and has two daughters.</i>

813
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.280
<i>A perfect life.</i>

814
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:23.680
<i>Until people around him start dying off.</i>

815
01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:28.280
<i>His daughters drowned,
his wife died in a car accident</i>

816
01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.680
<i>and Hart lost his mind.</i>

817
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:39.400
<i>He barricades himself in his house and
that's where he dies, in a massive fire.</i>

818
01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:40.760
<i>You know what's weird?</i>

819
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:44.440
<i>What's left of his estate is
a few blocks from your house, Clare.</i>

820
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:54.610
There was another phrase on the box
I don't think you saw.

821
01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:56.880
<i>It was a warning.</i>

822
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:02.440
<i>"After seven wishes,
the</i> Yaoguai <i>claims the soul."</i>

823
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:11.800
That's its final price.

824
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:30.330
- Hey.
- What?

825
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.760
How many wishes have you made?

826
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:39.040
I've made five wishes.

827
01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.560
Jesus, Clare.
What the hell is wrong with you?

828
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:42.520
I'm sorry, but...

829
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:44.600
"But" how is there a "but?" People are dead!

830
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:47.000
It was just nice to be normal for a while.

831
01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:47.920
That's your excuse?

832
01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:49.200
What'd you wish for, anyway?

833
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:50.360
- That nice house?
- No.

834
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:53.520
Oh now, bullshit! People are dead, Clare.
You can't just wish that away.

835
01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:54.680
You can't take that back.

836
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:56.520
I know, and I said I was sorry.

837
01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.560
I didn't know that any of this would happen.

838
01:04:58.650 --> 01:04:59.520
Know what I wish?

839
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:01.760
I wish I never met you. That's what I wish.

840
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:10.720
It's my fault.
And I know that I have to get rid of it.

841
01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.040
Will you please help me?

842
01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:17.560
Please, Ryan?

843
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:26.770
Okay, let's do it.

844
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:29.360
Okay.

845
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:48.760
Bitch!

846
01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:58.650
She was my best friend, Clare.

847
01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:03.000
I'm sorry.

848
01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:37.440
What are you doing here?

849
01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.320
Why haven't you answered my texts?

850
01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:41.000
You need to leave right now.

851
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:42.280
What if I said...

852
01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:45.120
I don't want to live without you.

853
01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:46.200
And I don't want you...

854
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.320
to live without me.

855
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:50.920
Please. Just, just leave.

856
01:06:51.290 --> 01:06:53.320
- So, we're done?
- Oh, my God!

857
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:56.840
Yes.

858
01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:02.840
I love you, Clare.

859
01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:14.200
Where is it?

860
01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.640
What, what do you mean?

861
01:07:18.930 --> 01:07:20.150
I don't know.

862
01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:21.960
It's...

863
01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:24.040
I don't know. It was right there last night.

864
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:26.240
It was right in there. I...

865
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:31.320
Oh...

866
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:32.760
What does that mean?

867
01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:37.120
I...

868
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:38.320
Maybe it's done with you.

869
01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:39.640
Maybe it's over.

870
01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.010
Well, what now? What would I do? What...

871
01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:45.410
You move on with your life.

872
01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.750
You can do it.

873
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.270
That's easy to say, Ryan.

874
01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.030
No, it's easy to wish.

875
01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.550
I liked it. I liked having it.

876
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.310
It made me feel special.

877
01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.350
Is there anything you wished for
that you can't live without?

878
01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.670
- No.
- See, you don't need it.

879
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.590
Dad?

880
01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.630
What's going on?

881
01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.990
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

882
01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.240
It's unbelievable. I mean, who forgets
to pay their taxes for ten years?

883
01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.110
Your mother's crazy Uncle August.

884
01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.110
Well, here we are.

885
01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.630
Home sweet home.

886
01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:58.230
<i># You're a curse #
# A disease, and I caught it #</i>

887
01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.830
<i># Like a drug, slowly pulsing #</i>

888
01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.510
Happy birthday, Clare.

889
01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.830
<i># And I don't want it anymore #</i>

890
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.120

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.350
<i># I go round #</i>

892
01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.630
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

893
01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.030
<i># Wondering why you don't gain #</i>

894
01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.950

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.200
Recycle first.

896
01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.590
Gross.

897
01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.830
Mmmm, hot.

898
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.510

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.510
<i># They're always telling you, #
# You're going somewhere #</i>

900
01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.380
<i># You're going nowhere #</i>

901
01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.870
<i># You're going somewhere, #
# You're going nowhere #</i>

902
01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.750
<i># They're always telling you #</i>

903
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.830
<i># You're going somewhere, #
# You're going nowhere #</i>

904
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.630
You stole it?

905
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.470
You couldn't get rid of it.
You saw what it did to Meredith.

906
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.070
I'm just trying to protect you, okay?

907
01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.070
Okay, so you think that you can control it.

908
01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.480
You think you can, Clare?

909
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.070
Really?

910
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.590
Are you crazy?

911
01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.110
Why would you bring it here
in the first place?

912
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.230
'Cause I have two little sisters at home.

913
01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.960
Give it back. Right now.

914
01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.430
After everything that's happened?

915
01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.240
Yes, June.

916
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.680
What's wrong with you?

917
01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.070
No! Clare, no, stop it. Clare!

918
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.950
You see what it's done. This is a bad idea.

919
01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.600
- June, go away.
- Stop, listen to me! Just stop!

920
01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.070
Clare, come on! No, no, no. Clare, come here.

921
01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.590
- Just give it to me, Clare. Stop.
- Let go, June!

922
01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.830
- Let go! Let go!
- Clare?

923
01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.150
- Clare!
- No!

924
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:30.860
June?

925
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.580
June? Is she going to be okay?

926
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.020
What is wrong with you?

927
01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:47.500
Clare?

928
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:49.540
- Go away!
- I thought we were done with this.

929
01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:50.620
I'm not ready yet.

930
01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:52.220
You can't keep it. You know that.

931
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:54.020
- You have to get rid of it!
- You don't understand.

932
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.020
I'm not ready yet!

933
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.380
What about everything we talked about?

934
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:57.580
I won't wish anymore, okay?

935
01:11:57.710 --> 01:11:59.340
Okay, it'll be fine. I just won't wish.

936
01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:00.910
I'm gonna hang on to it for a while.

937
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:02.580
Clare, please, you're not hearing yourself.

938
01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:04.460
You can't control it. It's controlling you!

939
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:06.660
Go away! Okay?

940
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.300
Please go away.

941
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:12.060
I have two wishes left
and if you do not go away,

942
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:14.980
I will use one on you,
I swear I'll use it on you.

943
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:16.740
Go away!

944
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:23.580
You can't keep running from this!

945
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:30.500
I know, I know what to do.

946
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:35.060
I know, I know what to do,
I know when to... Okay.

947
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:36.620
Okay.

948
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:39.420
If I had... No.

949
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:44.140
If I just don't make any more wishes,
everything will be fine.

950
01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.340
Everything will be fine.

951
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:50.700
Clare? School just called.

952
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:57.180
Clare? What's going on?

953
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:59.020
Get down here!

954
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.580
Okay.

955
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:04.620
I have two wishes left.

956
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:09.620
I have two wishes left.

957
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:12.660
Two wishes.

958
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:18.100
I wish my mother never committed suicide.

959
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:26.940
Oh, God.

960
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:37.460
Clare?

961
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:47.780
Mom?

962
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.900
Mom?

963
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:55.860
I missed you so much!

964
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:59.060
You missed me so much? What?

965
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:02.140
Happy birthday! We got you cake!

966
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:04.460
- Sssh!
- And presents!

967
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:09.300
Okay, come on. What's the holdup?
Downstairs, kiddo. Chop-chop.

968
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.490
Al'right. Here it is.

969
01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.900
Yay!

970
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.010
<i># Happy birthday... #</i>

971
01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:23.730
<i># Happy birthday... #</i>

972
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.130
Happy birthday, kiddo.

973
01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.130
Thank you, Dad.

974
01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.010
Make a wish.

975
01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:40.570
Clare?

976
01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:42.170
I'm up here.

977
01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:44.090
Come open your presents.

978
01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:46.530
Okay.

979
01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.930
<i>Mommy! Come on, Max!</i>

980
01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:52.130
This is your fault.

981
01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.380
This is your fault. Everything is your fault.

982
01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.010
Oh, my God!

983
01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:02.770
What?

984
01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.040
No. No!

985
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:15.770
Yeah, right there is good.

986
01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.890
- Yeah.
- You think so, man?

987
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.570
No, no, no, no!

988
01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.810
Dad! Dad!

989
01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.730
Dad!

990
01:16:25.820 --> 01:16:27.610
Dad!

991
01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:31.730
- Oh, my God! My God!
- No!

992
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.090
Jon!

993
01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.010
No...

994
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.250
Argh!

995
01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.330
- No!
- Are you...

996
01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:44.370
What happened? Are you...

997
01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:46.890
Jonathan! No!

998
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.090
No! No!

999
01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:01.880
I've got one wish left.

1000
01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:06.400
I know how to beat you!

1001
01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:07.960
I wanna go back!

1002
01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.080
I wanna go back before I got you!

1003
01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:12.720
I wanna go back.

1004
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:17.090
My final wish is I wanna go back
to the morning my dad found you.

1005
01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:20.840
I wanna go back right now!

1006
01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:30.960
Max?

1007
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:32.760
Hi, Max!

1008
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:35.000
Mmm... hi.

1009
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:36.890
Oh, who's a good boy!

1010
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:50.200
Wait.

1011
01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:56.560
Wait, wait, wait. Wait! Wait!

1012
01:17:57.210 --> 01:17:58.240
Wait! Wait!

1013
01:17:58.330 --> 01:18:00.320
Wait! Hang on, hang on!

1014
01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:05.400
<i>I'm not awake right now.</i>

1015
01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:07.480
- <i>What do you want?</i>
- Nothing. Hi.

1016
01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:09.840
I just wanted to, you know, hear your voice.

1017
01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:13.520
<i>Seriously? You don't need a kidney
or some ridiculous words of wisdom?</i>

1018
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:15.360
- No, I just, no...
- <i>Alright, you know</i>

1019
01:18:15.450 --> 01:18:18.480
- <i>I'm gonna go back to sleep, okay? Night!</i>
- Okay, okay.

1020
01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:20.800
Dad!

1021
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:25.480
- Hey!
- Hey. What's all this?

1022
01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:30.040
Um, nothing. I just... um I was just
wondering if I could go with you guys.

1023
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:32.480
You know, like old times.

1024
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:34.680
- Yeah. Get in.
- Awesome.

1025
01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:37.640
Sure, it'll be like old times.
Be our good luck charm.

1026
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:41.240
Aw, you look so nice.

1027
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:28.080
Clare, you find anything?

1028
01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:29.390
I found...

1029
01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:33.290
I found these. I don't know
what you could use them for.

1030
01:19:34.050 --> 01:19:36.440
Maybe around the house?
I don't know, they're kind of neat.

1031
01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:39.520
- Yeah, I can do something with these.
- Yeah?

1032
01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:41.560
Hey, Carl. Check it out.

1033
01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:43.570
Told you my kid has an eye.

1034
01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:46.640
You always were my good luck charm.

1035
01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:48.680
You gotta come with us again.

1036
01:19:49.890 --> 01:19:50.800
Yeah, maybe I will.

1037
01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:54.290
I have to get to school,
but have fun today. Love you.

1038
01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:55.280
Love you too, buddy.

1039
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:57.880
- Yeah, thank you so much.
- You got it.

1040
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:11.210
Let's go buddy.

1041
01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:16.480
Ryan! Ryan, hey.

1042
01:20:17.690 --> 01:20:20.080
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh, sure.

1043
01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:21.520
Okay, um...

1044
01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:24.560
First off, I just wanted to say, um...

1045
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:27.560
I'm sorry for the whole McFarts thing.

1046
01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:29.400
Wait. What? Really?

1047
01:20:29.770 --> 01:20:31.090
Yeah. Um...

1048
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:34.480
But you know what, maybe in the
multiverse, that didn't happen.

1049
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:38.000
- Hold on, you dig on multiverses?
- Yeah.

1050
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:41.480
And, also, maybe in the multiverse,
we're really good friends.

1051
01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:44.240
Maybe... we're even dating.

1052
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:48.160
Well... have we done it?

1053
01:20:48.970 --> 01:20:50.000
No, not yet.

1054
01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:55.000
I have also met your cousin, Gina.
Hung out in her loft and everything.

1055
01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:58.440
Okay, you're freaking me out right now.

1056
01:20:58.530 --> 01:20:59.520
Yeah, good.

1057
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:01.480
'Cause I need a favor.

1058
01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:04.720
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy but...

1059
01:21:06.930 --> 01:21:08.440
please don't open this.

1060
01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:11.200
Just... just bury it. No shortcuts.

1061
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:14.080
Uh... okay.

1062
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.320
What's in it for me?

1063
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:19.960
Dinner, if you want?

1064
01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:23.600
And maybe we could talk more
on this whole multiverse thing?

1065
01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:29.560
Yeah, and you can tell me how you
know my cousin and that she has a loft.

1066
01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:31.520
- Done.
- Cool.

1067
01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:45.120
Dude!

1068
01:21:46.730 --> 01:21:47.640
I'll see you around.

1069
01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:04.470
I didn't see her.

1070
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:07.330
I just didn't see her.

1071
01:22:56.890 --> 01:23:01.080
<i># Be careful what you wish for #
# Be careful what you wish for #</i>

1072
