Maybe because the antenna's broken?

Okay, in that case,
you need to re-wire the FCC

330

to the most powerful antenna

344
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.360
I'm sorry for being so naughty.

345
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Hey, always be your brother's hero.

The Tree Farm is overloading.

350
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.280
It was never designed
for this much naughtiness.

351
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.880

NOEL: Whoo-hoo!

357
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.960
Oh, man, are you heavy!

358
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.440
Oh. Just like the fortress
of Professor Permafrost.

359
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.800
Race you to the top, Snowball.

360

Here. You're the better shot.

368
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.960
Nah. I can't get a clear view.

369
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.560
Hurry, Wayne. We're at 97.

370
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.960
Ninety-eight!

371
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880
Holiday hug.

372
00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880
Huh?

373
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.880
Good thing
you're still using parachutes!

374
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.480

(CHEERING)

380
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.600

Well done, lads.

388
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.800
Ho! We'd better get a move on.
Don't want to be late, do we?
