00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.400
<i>These violent delights
have violent ends...</i>

9
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.840
<i>And in their triumph die,
like fire and powder...</i>

10
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.320

Gran?

12
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.680
Edward, don't!
She will see you.

13
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.360
Okay.

14
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.120
Grandma, I would like
you to meet...

15
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.000
Happy birthday, Bella.

16
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.880
Happy birthday, Bells.

17
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.560
I thought we agreed,
no presents.

18
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.960
Well, the one from me
is not wrapped.

19
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.840
So, don't count.

20
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.640
It's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.

21
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.600
Uh, goes with this one
from your mom.

22
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.320
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.

23
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.000
It's to put your pictures in,
from senior year.

24
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.880
Senior year.

25
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.680
How'd you get so old so fast?
- I didn't.

26
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.360
It's not that old.
- I don't know.

27
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.120
Is that a grey hair?

28
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.760
No! No way!

29
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.400
Happy Birthday.

30
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.040
It's really funny.

31
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.720
<i>Another missing hiker brings
the total to three presumed deaths.</i>

32
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.800
<i>The Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...</i>

33
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.880
Oh, it's Bella.
Bella!

34
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.280
Today is the big day, Bella.

35
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.560
Uh, R and J essay due?
- Oh, yeah!

36
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.280
Wherefore art thou, Bella?

37
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.960
I wanna take a picture of you guys.
My Mom...

38
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.880
...wants me to put together, like...

39
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.160
...a scrapbook full of memories.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

40
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.000
I take them, I'm not in them.
- No, no, no, come here.

41
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.560
You'll photoshop my nose
if it looks big, right?

42
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.320
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

43
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.680
It's good.

44
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.840
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.

45
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.600
Well, catch you later.

46
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.600
Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.

47
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.400
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.

48
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.800
But my aging is not.
- Your aging?

49
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.520
I think 18 is all youngster,
don't worry about that.

50
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.320
It's one year older than you.

51
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.400
No, it isn't.

52
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.880
I'm a hundred and nine.
- Wow!

53
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.560
Maybe I should not be dating
such an old man.

54
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.600
It's gross!

55
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.400
I should feel certainly repulse.

56
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.600
We have to go to class.
- Yeah.

57
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.520
Wait a second.

58
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.120
Someone wants you.

59
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.200
Bella.
- Jacob!

60
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.880
I'll leave you to talk.

61
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.160
Hello, biceps!

62
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.120
You know, anabolic steroids are
really bad for you.

63
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.440
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.

64
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.120
You know, wouldn't seem so drastic
if we hung out more.

65
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.000
We should switch schools.

66
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.680
Then you can come hang out
with the pale faces.

67
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.680
I'm alright.

68
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.280
I prefer the Res school's exclusivity.

69
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
They let any old rift raft into this place.

70
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.440
I see.
Why are you summing it?

71
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.000
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

72
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.640
You should really come, take a ride,
when it's done.

73
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.080
Is it fast?
- Huh, it's decent.

74
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.720
Okay.
- Okay, good.

75
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.600
Hey, happy birthday.

76
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.880
Your Dad told my Dad.
So...

77
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.680
Yeah, of course, he did.

78
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.400
I saw this the other day and
thought of you.

79
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.360
It catches bad dreams.

80
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.080
It's perfect.

81
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.520
Thank you.
- No problem.

82
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.480
See you soon. Bye.
- Yeah, see you later.

83
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.880
So, how come Jacob Black gets to
give you a gift and I don't?

84
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.480
Because I have nothing
to give back to you.

85
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.920
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.

86
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.960
See? Thank you.
That's all I want.

87
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.200
Bella!

88
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.720
Happy Birthday!
- Shhh!

89
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.040
I thought, I said you,
no presents.

90
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.120
I've already seen you open it
and guess what?

91
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.600
You love it!

92
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.160
You're gonna wear it tonight,
our house.

93
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.520
Come on, please?
It will be fun.

94
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.240
Okay. alright.
- Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.

95
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.200
Jasper, no fair
with the mood control thing.

96
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.400
Sorry, Bella.

97
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.080
Happy...

98
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.400
Never mind.

99
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.720
You can't trust vampires.

100
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.400
Trust me!

101
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.480
<i>O, my love!
My wife!</i>

102
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.240
<i>Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath.</i>

103
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.840
<i>Hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.</i>

104
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.560
<i>Thou art not conquered.</i>

105
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.440
<i>Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips
and in thy cheeks.</i>

106
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.440
<i>And death's pale flag
is not advanced there.</i>

107
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.880
<i>I hate being celebrated.</i>

108
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.600
<i>There are worse tragedies.</i>

109
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.920
<i>Hm, look at Romeo.</i>

110
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.560
<i>He kills his true love
out of sheer stupidity.</i>

111
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.080
Yeah.

112
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.520
Though I do envy him,
one thing.

113
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.720
Juliet. She's like perfect.

114
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.760
If you like that obviously
beautiful sort of thing.

115
00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.080
No, not the girl, dear.

116
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.520
The suicide.

117
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.760
It's nearly impossible for...

118
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.520
...some people.

119
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.080
For humans,
a little poison...

120
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.720
...a dagger to the heart...

121
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.000
So many different options.

122
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.840
Why would you say that?

123
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.080
Because I considered it once.

124
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.720
I didn't know,
if I'd get to you in time.

125
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.800
I had to come up with
some kind of...

126
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.240
...plan.

127
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.480
And what was the plan?

128
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.440
I would go to Italy,

129
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.840
...and provoke the Volturi.

130
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.320
The what?
- The Volturi...

131
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.600
Now, who would like to repeat
the last few lines...

132
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.880
just to show,
they were paying attention?

133
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.040
Mr. Cullen.

134
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.800
Oh, yes, Mr. Birdy.

135
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.880
O, here.

136
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.080
Will I set up my everlasting rest,

137
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.680
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

138
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.160
Eyes, look your last!

139
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.440
Arms, take your last embrace!

140
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.520
And lips, O you,
the doors of breath,

141
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.360
...seal with a righteous kiss.

142
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.160
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!

143
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.240
Eyes on the screen, people.

144
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.080
<i>Thus with a kiss I die.</i>

145
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.320
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

146
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.400
I guess, the closest thing to royalty
my world has.

147
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.360
Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.

148
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.080
He lived with them
for a few decades.

149
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.600
Described them as
very refined.

150
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.000
No respect for human life,
of course, but...

151
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.160
...respect for the arts
and science as at least.

152
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.600
<i>And the law...</i>

153
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.480
<i>...above all of law.</i>

154
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.240
<i>And vampires have laws?</i>

155
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.680
<i>Not very many.</i>

156
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.840
<i>There's only one and
it's regularly enforced.</i>

157
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.360
<i>What is it?</i>

158
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.520
<i>To keep the existence
of our kind a secret.</i>

159
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.600
<i>We don't make spectacles
of ourselves,</i>

160
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.960
<i>And we don't kill conspicuously.</i>

161
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.400
<i>Unless, of course,
you want to die.</i>

162
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.120
We have to talking about that.

163
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.160
I can't even think...

164
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.880
...about someone hurting you.

165
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.320
Bella, the only thing that
can hurt me is you.

166
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.240
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.

167
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.880
That's not true.

168
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.920
Victoria?
She will come for me one day.

169
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.280
Alice will see
what she decides and...

170
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.080
...we will be ready.
- I can protect you.

171
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.120
If you change me.

172
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.640
Bella, you already do protect me.

173
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.280
You're my only reason...

174
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.160
...to stay alive,
if that's what I am.

175
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.760
But it's my job to protect you.

176
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.920
From everyone except my sister.

177
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.120
It's time!

178
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.120
It's time! It's time!
It's time!

179
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.760
Sorry about all this.
We tried to rein Alice in.

180
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.200
Like it's even possible.

181
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.160
Happy big Birthday, Bella!
- Thanks.

182
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.920
I found it in your bag, mind?

183
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.800
Dating an older woman?
Hot!

184
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.760
What?

185
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.400
You first, Rosalie.

186
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.520
It's a necklace.

187
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.400
Alice picked it up.
- Thanks.

188
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.200
Show me the love!

189
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.640
This is from Emmett.

190
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.360
Already installed it in your truck.

191
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.960
Finally, a decent sound system
for that piece of...

192
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.240
Hey, don't... don't hate the truck.

193
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.480
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

194
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.480
Just a little something
to brighten your day.

195
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.440
We think, you looking
kind of pale lately.

196
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.440
Paper cut.

197
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.480
Jas... Jas!

198
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.960
It's okay.
It's just a little...

199
00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.080
...blood.

200
00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.200
Get Jasper out of here.

201
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.200
I'm sor...
I'm sorry, I can't.

202
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.920
I'll have to stitch this up
in my office.

203
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.240
Check on Jasper.

204
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.520
I'm sure, he's very upset with himself.

205
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.160
And I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

206
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.760
Edward?

207
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.400
I never wanted that party.
- It's not your fault.

208
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.600
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood
as long as the rest of us.

209
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.880
How do you do it?

210
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.160
Years and years of practice.

211
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.480
Did you ever think it of...

212
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.960
...just doing it the easier way?

213
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.160
No.

214
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.360
I knew who I wanted to be.

215
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.400
I wanted to help people.

216
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.200
Brings me happiness.

217
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.720
Even if I'm damned about this.

218
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.400
Damned?

219
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.080
Like... like hell?

220
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.160
Carlisle, you can't be damned.

221
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.440
You couldn't, it's impossible.

222
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.520
Thank you, Bella.

223
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.720
You always been very...

224
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.080
...gracious about us.

225
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.320
So, that's it?

226
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.480
That's why he won't change me?

227
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.480
Imagine the situation in reverse.

228
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.640
If you believed as Edward does...

229
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.560
...would you take away his soul?

230
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.040
You can't protect me.

231
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.440
From everything.

232
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.600
At some point,
something's gonna separate us.

233
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.240
It's gonna be an accident,

234
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.000
...or illness,

235
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.240
...or old age.

236
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.440
As long as I'm human.

237
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.040
And the only solution
is to change me.

238
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.000
That's not a solution,
it's a tragedy.

239
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.840
You're not gonna love me
when I look like a grandmother.

240
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.040
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you? No?

241
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.040
Carlisle told me...

242
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.000
...how you feel about your soul.

243
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.680
I don't believe that.

244
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.640
So don't worry about mine.

245
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.000
You should go inside.

246
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.400
It's still my birthday.

247
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.920
Can I ask one thing?

248
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.200
Kiss me?

249
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.000
I love you.

250
00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.080
I love you.

251
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.720
Hi.

252
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.040
Come for a walk with me.

253
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.640
We got to leave Forks.

254
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.600
Why?

255
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.760
Carlisle's supposed to be
ten years older than he looks.

256
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.280
People are starting to notice.

257
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.880
Okay, I...

258
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.000
I gotta think of something
to say to Charlie.

259
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.880
When you say "we"...

260
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.480
I mean to my family and myself.

261
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.720
Edward, what happened with Jasper,

262
00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.840
...it's nothing.
- You're right.

263
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.360
It was nothing.

264
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.200
Nothing the way
I always expected.

265
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.280
And nothing compared to
what could have happened.

266
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.160
You just don't belong
to my world, Bella.

267
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.360
I belong with you.

268
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
No, you don't.

269
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.400
I'm coming.

270
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.800
Bella.

271
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.080
I don't want you to come.

272
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.200
You don't want me?

273
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.960
No.

274
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.280
This changes things.

275
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.640
alright.

276
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.480
But if it's not
too much to ask...

277
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.520
...can you at least
promise me something?

278
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.320
Don't do anything reckless.

279
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.120
For Charlie's sake.

280
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.720
And I'll promise something
to you in return.

281
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.600
This is the last time
you'll ever see me.

282
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.320
I won't come back.

283
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.120
And you can go on
with your life...

284
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.400
...without any interference from me.

285
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.000
It will be like...

286
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.000
I never existed,
I promise.

287
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.080
If this is about my soul, take it.

288
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.280
I don't want without you.
- It's not about your soul.

289
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.560
You're just not good for me.

290
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.880
I'm not good enough for you?

291
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.920
I'm just sorry,
I let this go on for so long.

292
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.200
Please...

293
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.200
...don't.

294
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.400
Goodbye.

295
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.400
Edward?

296
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.400
Edward!

297
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.120
Edward!

298
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.400
I'll try to call Cullens place again.

299
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.920
The Cullens left town, Charlie.
- Good riddance!

300
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.880
Where did they go?

301
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.800
We'll find her, Charlie.
- Thanks, Harry.

302
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.160
Charlie?

303
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.440
She's alright.

304
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.560
I got her.

305
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.400
Thank you, Sam.

306
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.320
<i>Alice,</i>

307
00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.040
<i>...you have disappeared.</i>

308
00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.640
<i>Like everything else.</i>

309
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.520
<i>But who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.</i>

310
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.560
<i>When you left...</i>

311
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.360
<i>and he left...</i>

312
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.400
<i>You took everything with you.</i>

313
00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.560
<i>But the absence of him
is everywhere I look...</i>

314
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.440
<i>It's like a huge hole...</i>

315
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.520
<i>...has been punched through my chest.</i>

316
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.600
<i>But in a way I'm glad.</i>

317
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.840
<i>The pain is my only reminder that
he was real...</i>

318
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.880
<i>...that you all were.</i>

319
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.240
alright, that's it.

320
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.640
What?

321
00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.040
You're going to Jacksonville
to live with your mother.

322
00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.440
I'm not leaving Forks.

323
00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.280
Bells...

324
00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.680
...he's not coming back.

325
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.400
I know.

326
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.520
It's just not normal,
this behavior.

327
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.120
Quite frankly, it's scaring
the hell outta me,

328
00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.840
...and you Mother.

329
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.720
Baby, I... I don't want you to leave.

330
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.600
I don't.

331
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.640
But... just go...

332
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.640
Go to Jacksonville,
make some new friends...

333
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.120
I like my old friends.
- Well, you never see them anymore.

334
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.120
I do, yeah.

335
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.360
I'm...

336
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.760
...gonna go shopping tomorrow,
with Jessica.

337
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.440
You hate shopping.

338
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.800
I...

339
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.520
I need a girl's night out.

340
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.880
alright.
Girl's night.

341
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.400
Shopping.

342
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.360
I like it, go.

343
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.480
Buy some good stuff.

344
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.480
<i>Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.</i>

345
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.320
<i>Oh, yeah, Bella Swan.</i>

346
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.200
I don't know, why you wanna sit through
all those zombies eating people,

347
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.600
...and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.

348
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.880
Like why there are
so many zombie movies anyway?

349
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.280
Is it supposed to like
draw a parallel with leprosy?

350
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.360
My cousin had leprosy,
it's not funny, you know?

351
00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.440
And like is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?

352
00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.440
Because don't be so pleased with
your own like...

353
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.120
...self-reverential cleverness, you know?

354
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.000
Like, some girls like to shop.

355
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.800
Not all girls, apparently.

356
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.640
I was surprised
you called at all, you know?

357
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.480
Like, your depression thing.
I'm totally... totally worried.

358
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.440
After a while, it's like,
she's still bumming?

359
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.720
And I'm going through
stuff too, you know?

360
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.720
Like Mike deciding
he wanted to "I just be friends? "

361
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.560
That's hard, you know?

362
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.080
<i>What's up, guys?</i>

363
00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.480
<i>Where you going?</i>

364
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.080
<i>Keep walking.</i>

365
00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.480
<i>This is dangerous.</i>

366
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.000
Dude, come on.

367
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.280
I think, I know those guys.

368
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.880
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?

369
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.240
I just need to see something.

370
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.320
<i>Hey, girlie!</i>

371
00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.160
alright, alright!
We got a taker.

372
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.720
<i>Turn around.</i>

373
00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.240
Sorry, I thought
you were somebody else.

374
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.360
That's cool! I'll be whomever
you want to be, honey.

375
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.280
So, what do you say?

376
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.040
<i>You promised me nothing reckless.</i>

377
00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.720
You promised, it would as
you never existed.

378
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.040
You lied.
- Say some, babe?

379
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.200
You know what?
Never mind.

380
00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.080
Stop!

381
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.880
Stop! Stop!
Stop!

382
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.280
Hey, um, what the hell is
wrong with you?

383
00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.760
Just curious.

384
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.560
I thought that I saw something.

385
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.760
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.

386
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.640
That homeboy
could have been a psycho.

387
00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.920
I was about to end up
in a FBI interview room,

388
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.920
...like some lame TV show.

389
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.280
Oh, that was such a rush.

390
00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:06.640
Awesome!

391
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.600
So, you're an adrenaline junky now?

392
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.840
That's cool!
You can go bungee jumping.

393
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.280
You don't get on the back of some
random loser's motorcycle!

394
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.680
Crazy!

395
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.040
<i>Alice, I saw him.</i>

396
00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.480
<i>Maybe I'm crazy now,
but I guess that's okay.</i>

397
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.600
<i>If the rush of danger is
what it takes to see him...</i>

398
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.160
<i>...then that's what I'll find.</i>

399
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.800
Bella!

400
00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.960
Where the hell have you been, crazy?

401
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.320
I... brought you something.
- Okay.

402
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.040
It's a little crazy.

403
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.240
Wow, scrap metal!

404
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.760
You shouldn't have.
- I saved them from the junkyard.

405
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.880
I think, they'll probably cost
more to fix than they're worth.

406
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.880
...but then I thought that...

407
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.800
if I had a mechanic-type friend
to help me out,

408
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.200
Huh, me?

409
00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.480
Being the mechanic-type friend?
- That's right.

410
00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.480
Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.

411
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.320
I get it if you think this is
really stupid and reckless.

412
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.520
Yeah, it's completely
stupid and reckless.

413
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:37.960
When do we start?

414
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.480
Now. Please.
- alright.

415
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.920
Oh, hey, be careful.
These things are actually really...

416
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.520
...heavy. So,

417
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.520
Jacob, you're like buff.

418
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.360
How that can happen?
You're like 16, I don't get it.

419
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.640
Age is just a number, baby.
What, you're like 40, now?

420
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.480
Feels like that sometimes.

421
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.480
That song was good.
You don't like it?

422
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.640
I don't really like...

423
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.680
...music anymore kind of...

424
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.800
Okay.
No more music.

425
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.800
I was thinking,
if we're gonna do this everyday,

426
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.560
...and hopefully we will...

427
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.360
We have to, like, fit some homework
in there somewhere.

428
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.360
I don't want Billy thinking that
I'm a bad influence on you.

429
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.240
You influence me?
Please.

430
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.560
Are you...?
I'm older than you.

431
00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.160
So that makes me the influencer
and you the influence.

432
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.760
No, no, no.

433
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.560
My size and knowledge base actually
makes me older than you.

434
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.000
Because of your gentle paleness
and lack of know-how.

435
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.720
I convinced you to build
two-wheeled death machines with me.

436
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.000
Don't you think that makes
you funny, young and naive?

437
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.760
Okay.
So, where do we stand?

438
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.080
I'm thirty five...

439
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.480
...and you might be like 32.
- Come on.

440
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.520
Yo, Jake, you in there?
- No, it's okay.

441
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.200
It's... It's just my boys.

442
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.280
Hey, Jake.
- Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

443
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.880
Bella, that's Quil and Embry.

444
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.200
I'm Quil Ateara.

445
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.160
So the bike building story is true.

446
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.320
Oh, yeah, yeah!
I taught him everything he knows.

447
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.840
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

448
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.720
Uh, we're friends, you know?
- Hmm. Burn!

449
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.440
Actually, I remember, I said
she's a girl and a friend.

450
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.520
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?

451
00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.400
Nope!

452
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.040
So you guys have girlfriends.
It's awesome.

453
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.400
Yeah, right.

454
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.120
Quil's actually taken his cousin to prom.

455
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.600
Yeah, that's still a riot.

456
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.600
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.

457
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.280
Jesus!

458
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.040
I got five bucks on Quil.
- You're on.

459
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.760
<i>Dear Alice, I wish,
I had your real address.</i>

460
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.760
<i>I wish, I could tell you
about Jake.</i>

461
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.400
<i>He makes me feel better.</i>

462
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.680
<i>I mean,
he makes me feel alive.</i>

463
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.720
<i>The hole in my chest...</i>

464
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.600
<i>...while when I'm with Jake,</i>

465
00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.400
<i>It's like, it almost healed.
For a while.</i>

466
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.880
Quil keeps asking to come over.

467
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.320
I think he likes you
a little too much.

468
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.160
Oh, I'm really not into
the whole cougar thing, you know?

469
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.320
What's up with you and age?

470
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.360
I mean, how old was that
Cullen guy anyway?

471
00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.880
<i>But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.</i>

472
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.480
Hey, Bella!

473
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.920
You're alright. You're okay?
- No.

474
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.120
I thought this thing was
starting to work,

475
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.160
...but I guess not.

476
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.120
Can I ask you something?

477
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.960
Hanging out with Jacob...

478
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.720
...does seems to take your mind
off things for a bit, doesn't it?

479
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.640
You know, sometimes...

480
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.440
...you gotta learn to love
what's good for you.

481
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.280
You know, what I mean?

482
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.240
Of course, what do I know?

483
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.520
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

484
00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.600
Famous ladies man.

485
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.640
Okay...

486
00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.040
Go to bed.

487
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.600
I love you.

488
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.920
If I told you,

489
00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.320
...I couldn't have fixed these bikes,
what would you say?

490
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.240
Are you doubting your mad skills?

491
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.680
No, definitely not.
I mean, they're all fine.

492
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.120
It's just...

493
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.960
May be if I was smarter
would have dragged out to rebuild them.

494
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.960
If you told me,
you couldn't fix these bikes.

495
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.920
I would say that that's...

496
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.440
...really too bad but...

497
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.800
...he's gonna find something else to do.

498
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.160
Is that Sam Uley?

499
00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.960
Yeah, and his cult.

500
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.720
Oh, my God!

501
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.560
Did you see that?

502
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.560
They're not really fighting, Bella.

503
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.400
They're cliff diving.

504
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.480
Scary as hell,
but a total rush.

505
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.920
Rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.

506
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.240
We'll leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.

507
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.760
Is some kind of beef
with them or something?

508
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.200
Oh, no.

509
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.520
They just think they run this place.

510
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.440
Embry used to call them hall
monitors on steroids.

511
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.160
Now, look at him.
- That's Embry?

512
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.000
Yeah.
- What happened to him?

513
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.000
He missed some school...

514
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.080
...and all of a sudden started following
Sam around like a little puppy.

515
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.480
Same thing with Paul and Jared.

516
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.080
Sam keeps giving me this look,

517
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.520
...like he's waiting for me
or something.

518
00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.200
It's kinda starting to freak me out.

519
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.800
Well, you should just avoid him.

520
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.800
I'll try.

521
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.240
Okay.

522
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.520
You look scared.
- I'm not.

523
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:25.680
Alright! Brake.

524
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.360
Clutch. Good.

525
00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.880
Gas.

526
00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.680
Ready?

527
00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.720
Now slowly... release the clutch.

528
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.200
<i>Bella.</i>

529
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.840
<i>Stop.</i>

530
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.400
You alright?

531
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.000
I'm gonna go again.

532
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.320
Hit the brake!

533
00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.520
I wanna go again.
- Are you trying to get yourself killed?

534
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:41.120
I'll try again.
- No, forget it.

535
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.560
No more bikes.

536
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.160
Man, your head.

537
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.440
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

538
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.160
You're apologizing for bleeding?

539
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.440
Yeah, I guess, I am.

540
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.440
It's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.

541
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.080
What are you staring at?

542
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.600
You're sort of beautiful.

543
00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.840
How hard did you hit your head?

544
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.520
I don't know.

545
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.120
Let's go.

546
00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.080
I did see something in the woods.
- Sure, baby, I believe you.

547
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.680
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.

548
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.720
It was jet black and huge.

549
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.280
On all fours, it was still taller
than a person.

550
00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.880
A bear, may be?

551
00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.160
Or an alien.
You're lucky that you didn't get probed.

552
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.520
Oh, yeah.

553
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.200
Well, I saw it.

554
00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.400
You're not the only one.

555
00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.680
My Dad's been getting reports
at the station.

556
00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.920
Like five hikers been killed by some bear.

557
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.840
But they can't find the bear.

558
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.760
Last time you clowns
doubt my girlfriend.

559
00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.840
So, I mean...

560
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.240
Bella is back.

561
00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:38.000
Yeah, I guess so.
- Huh, that's... Welcome.

562
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.360
So listen, not now that...
You know, you're talking and...

563
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.160
...eating again, you know?

564
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.080
You gotta get that protein in there.

565
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.680
I was just wondering,
if you wanted to go see a movie with me.

566
00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.200
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I do.

567
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.280
Cool, um, let me see...

568
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.920
We could check out
"Love spelled backwards is love. "

569
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.320
Yeah, it's a dumb title,
but, um, it's a romantic comedy.

570
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.360
I mean, it's supposed to be.
- No. No romance.

571
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.440
How about "Face Punch"?
You heard of that?

572
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.360
Well, it's an action movie.
- Yeah, it's perfect.

573
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.360
With guns... adrenaline...

574
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.440
...it's my thing
- Okay.

575
00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.840
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys wanna go see...

576
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.360
..."Face Punch"?
- "Face Punch"? Yeah!

577
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.000
Mike, hey, we were supposed
to watch that?

578
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.800
Remember the trailer's like...
- Yeah?

579
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.960
Punch his face in.
- I don't remember that.

580
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.000
Movie night with Bella!

581
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.880
So, "Face Punch", huh?
You like action movies?

582
00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.080
Not really.

583
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.040
I heard it sucks. Bad.

584
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.240
Hey, are you even old enough
to see this movie?

585
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.360
I mean, you know, without adult supervision?
- Right, yeah.

586
00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.560
Well, she's buying my ticket for me.
- She's buying it, okay.

587
00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.880
Jessica bailed
and Angela's got the stomach flu

588
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.840
...so Eric's taking care of her.

589
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.400
So, it's just us three.
- Great.

590
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.320
Great.
- Yeah.

591
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.200
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

592
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.280
<i>Put your gun down or I'm gonna
blow your freaking head off.</i>

593
00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.120
<i>Both of you!</i>

594
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.480
<i>Put both of your guns down or I'm gonna
blow both of your freaking heads off.</i>

595
00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.360
<i>Alright, let's do this!</i>

596
00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.800
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up!

597
00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:14.000
Jesus!
- What a marshmallow!

598
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.040
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

599
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.760
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.

600
00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.480
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.

601
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.520
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's...

602
00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.880
...going around.

603
00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:38.160
What? I can't hold your hand?
- No, of course, you can.

604
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.080
I just think it means
something really different to you.

605
00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.280
So...

606
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.800
Okay, tell me something.
You like me, right?

607
00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.400
And you think, I'm sorta beautiful?

608
00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:03.480
Jake, please...
don't do this.

609
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.240
Why?

610
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.360
Because you are about
to ruin everything.

611
00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.360
And I need you.

612
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.320
Well, I've got loads of time.

613
00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:34.000
I'm not gonna give up.

614
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.040
I don't want you to.

615
00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.760
But...

616
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.480
It's just because I don't want you
to go anywhere.

617
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.960
It's... it's really selfish.

618
00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.760
You know, I'm not like a car
that you can fix up.

619
00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.720
I'm never gonna run right.

620
00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.960
So I should be fair to you.

621
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.280
It's because of him, right?

622
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.960
Look, I know what he did to you.

623
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.720
But, Bella, I would never,
ever do that.

624
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.880
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.

625
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.320
I won't let you down.

626
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.920
You can count on me.

627
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.800
Well...

628
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.200
I need to go home.

629
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.560
I'm... I was feeling sick
before the movie, okay?

630
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.400
What is your problem?
- Right now?

631
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.000
You are my problem.

632
00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.840
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

633
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.720
Do you want me
to put you in the hospital?

634
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.120
Jake... Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

635
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.160
Jake, you're really hot.

636
00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:31.960
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

637
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.960
I don't know what's happening.

638
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.040
I gotta go.

639
00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.000
That dude is weird.

640
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.320
<i>Jake.</i>

641
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.400
<i>Uh, your Dad says you have mono.</i>

642
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.200
<i>He won't let me visit but...
would you call me?</i>

643
00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.800
<i>Hey, uh, it's me again.
I just...</i>

644
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.520
<i>I'm sorry about what I said
at the movie theatre.</i>

645
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.720
<i>I just wanted to hear your voice.
So, no pressure.</i>

646
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.920
Jacob, please call me.

647
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:23.400
Okay, we should be
back around three.

648
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.040
Hey!

649
00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:35.640
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
- Yes, you do.

650
00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.560
Yeah, you do. Go.
What are you talking about?

651
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.720
Just be careful.
- I always am.

652
00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:45.680
Those bears won't get
the drop on me, Bella.

653
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.160
My kung foo is strong.

654
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.800
Jake!

655
00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.480
You cut your hair?

656
00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.600
And got a tattoo?

657
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.520
Bella...

658
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.240
I thought you were too sick
to come outside.

659
00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.760
Or pick up the phone
when I'd call.

660
00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:52.440
Go away.
- What?

661
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.760
Go away.

662
00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.600
What happened to you?
What's wrong?

663
00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:02.400
Hey, what happened?

664
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.880
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

665
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.080
Sam's trying to help me,
don't blame him.

666
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.360
But if you want somebody to blame,

667
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.760
How about those
filthy bloodsuckers, you love?

668
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.800
The Cullens.

669
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.400
I don't know
what are you talking abØut.

670
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.920
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

671
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.600
You been lying to everyone.
Charlie...

672
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.120
But you can't lie to me.

673
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:42.640
Not anymore, Bella.
- Come on! Jacob!

674
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.320
Look, Bella...

675
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.440
We can't be friends anymore.

676
00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.560
Jake, I know that
I have been...

677
00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.080
...hurting you.

678
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.720
It's... it's killing me.
It kills me.

679
00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.640
If you, may be,
give me like some time.

680
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:10.320
Don't!

681
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.840
It's not you.

682
00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.960
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?

683
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.360
It's true!
It is me.

684
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.600
I'm not good.

685
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.800
I used to be... a great kid.

686
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.760
Not anymore.

687
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.480
It doesn't even matter, alright?
This is over.

688
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.880
You can't break up with me.

689
00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.800
I mean...

690
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.440
I mean, you're my best friend.

691
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.000
You promised me.

692
00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.800
I know.

693
00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.040
I promised that
I won't hurt you, Bella.

694
00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.680
And this is me keeping that promise.

695
00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.240
Go home.

696
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.720
And don't come back.
Ør you're gonna get hurt.

697
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.400
<i>Alice...</i>

698
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.240
<i>Things are...</i>

699
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.840
<i>Things are bad again.</i>

700
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.200
<i>Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.</i>

701
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.880
<i>I don't see Edward anymore.</i>

702
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.320
<i>Now it really feels like
he never existed.</i>

703
00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:56.080
<i>I will find a place
where I can see him again.</i>

704
00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:54.480
Bella.
- Laurent!

705
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.760
I didn't expect to find you here.

706
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.080
I went to visit the Cullens, but...
the house is empty.

707
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.000
I'm surprised they left you behind.

708
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.320
Weren't you sort of a, um,

709
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.600
...a pet of theirs?

710
01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.920
Yeah. You could say that.

711
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.880
Do they Cullens visit often?

712
01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.040
<i>Lie.</i>

713
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.640
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
- Lie better.

714
01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.520
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

715
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.600
I probably shouldn't tell...

716
01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.400
...to Edward.

717
01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.000
Because he's pretty protective.
- But he's far away, isn't he?

718
01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.440
Why are you here?

719
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.640
I came as a favor to Victoria.

720
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.400
Victoria?

721
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.280
She asked me to see
if you were still...

722
01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.560
...under the protection
of the Cullens.

723
01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.400
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edwards mate...

724
01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.400
...given he killed hers.

725
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.480
An eye for an eye.

726
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:18.080
Threaten him.
- Edward would know who did it!

727
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.000
And he'd come after you.

728
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.880
I don't think he will.

729
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.560
After all, how much could
you mean to him...

730
01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.400
...if he left you here unprØtected?

731
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.040
Victoria won't be happy
about me killing you.

732
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:37.520
But I can't help myself.

733
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.560
You're so mouthwatering.
- Please, don't!

734
01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.080
I mean, you'd helped us.
- Shhhh!

735
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.680
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.

736
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.520
Victoria plans on killing you
slowly, painfully,

737
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.320
...where as I'll make it quick.
I promise.

738
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.280
You will feel nothing.

739
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.640
Edward, I love you.

740
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.200
I don't believe it.

741
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.200
Dad, I saw them!

742
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.160
What's the matter?
- In the woods. They are not bears!

743
01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.120
What you mean in the woods?

744
01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.080
Bella, what the hell were you doing
out in the woods?

745
01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.800
They are wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves!

746
01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:34.080
Are you sure about that, Bella?
- Yeah, I just saw them.

747
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.720
They were after... something.

748
01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.600
Wolves? You saw?

749
01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.520
Alright.
Well, Harry,

750
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.520
...feel like going hunting?

751
01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.320
Can you get some of
your guys together?

752
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.840
Sure, yeah. I'll...
I'll just...

753
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.440
<i>I know that those wolves
will be dead.</i>

754
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.720
<i>And Laurent would have told her
I'm unprotected.</i>

755
01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.360
<i>Victoria.</i>

756
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.240
I should go to the station.

757
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.560
Dad, you should...
You should go.

758
01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.360
You can just stay in the house?

759
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.480
Bella!

760
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.680
Oh, you scared me.

761
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.960
What the hell are you doing?
- Back up. I'm coming up.

762
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.200
Look, look, I'm sorry.

763
01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.160
For what?
- I wish I could explain,

764
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.760
...but I literally... can't!

765
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.520
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone?

766
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.720
One that wasn't yours to share.

767
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.720
Well, that's what
it's like for me.

768
01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.080
Or worse.

769
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.600
You have no idea,
how tight I'm bounded.

770
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.440
I hate this.

771
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.240
I hate what they have
done to you.

772
01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.360
I mean, the killer part is
you already know!

773
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:15.040
Bella, do you remember,
when walked on the beach in La Push?

774
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.480
The sto...

775
01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:26.240
The story...
The story about the cold ones.

776
01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.080
I guees, I understand why that's
the only part you remember.

777
01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.360
There must gotta be something
You can do...

778
01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.760
No.
I'm in it for life.

779
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.040
May be we should just
get out of here for a while.

780
01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.960
We'll just leave.
Just you and me.

781
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.520
You can do that?

782
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.240
I'll do it for you.

783
01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.080
It's not something
I can just run away from, Bella.

784
01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:15.200
But I would run away with you.

785
01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.960
If I could.

786
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.600
I gotta go.
They'll certainly wonder where I am.

787
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.040
Come here.

788
01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.360
Please...
Try to remember.

789
01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:47.920
It would be so much easier
if you knew...

790
01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.520
I tried, but...
Jake.

791
01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.480
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.

792
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.040
Jake!

793
01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.360
Edward, I'm scared.

794
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.920
You should be.

795
01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.760
<i>Really it's just like an old story...</i>

796
01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.640
<i>That we're not supposed to
say anything about...</i>

797
01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.320
<i>Did you know, the Quileute are
supposed to be descendants from wØlves?</i>

798
01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.560
Bella.

799
01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.240
I need to see him.

800
01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.120
He's not in.

801
01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.960
I'm sorry, really need to see him.
- Bella?

802
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.280
What did you do?

803
01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:23.720
Okay, what did you do?
- Hey!

804
01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.880
What did you do to him?
- Easy!

805
01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.120
He didn't want this!
- But we do.

806
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.280
What did he do? What did he tell you?
- Both of you calm...

807
01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.640
Nothing! He told me nothing,
because he's scared of you!

808
01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.880
Too late, now.
- Bella, get back.

809
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.480
Paul, calm down now.

810
01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.240
Bella!

811
01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.880
Run!

812
01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.240
Jake, run!

813
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.920
Take Bella back to Emily's place.

814
01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.280
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

815
01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.000
<i>Alice...</i>

816
01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.920
<i>Is it possible that everything is true?</i>

817
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.040
<i>The fairy tales and
horror stories?</i>

818
01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.800
<i>Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane and normal at all?</i>

819
01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.240
Hey, I think, we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.

820
01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.080
I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.
Serve him right.

821
01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.280
No way. Jake's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?

822
01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.280
I gotta fiver says,
Paul doesn't touch him.

823
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.200
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.

824
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.240
Speak for yourself.

825
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.760
Oh, hey, about Emily...
Sam's fiance,

826
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.440
...don't stare.
It bugs him.

827
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.800
Why would I stare?

828
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.720
You guys hungry?
Like I have to ask...

829
01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.120
Who's this?

830
01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.520
Bella Swan.
Who else?

831
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.560
So, youre the vampire girl.

832
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.000
So, you're the wolf girl.

833
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.360
Guess so.

834
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.480
Well, I'm engaged to one.

835
01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.240
Save some for your brothers.

836
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.120
And the ladies first.

837
01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.400
Muffin?
- Sure. Thanks.

838
01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.280
Leave it to Jake upto find
a way around Sam's gag order.

839
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:26.080
He didn't say anything to me.
- That's a wolf thing.

840
01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.640
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want to or not.

841
01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.040
Alright, check it out!
We can hear each other's thoughts.

842
01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:34.240
Will you just shut up?
These are trade secrets.

843
01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.520
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.

844
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.560
I can't really run with vampires.

845
01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.800
Because they are fast.

846
01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:48.400
Yeah? Oh, we are faster.

847
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.120
Freaked out yet?

848
01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.120
You're not the first monsters, I met.

849
01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.120
Jake's right.
You are good with the weird.

850
01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.840
Sorry.

851
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.160
So you're a werewolf?

852
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.680
Yeah, last time I checked.

853
01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.760
A few lucky members of the tribe
that have the gene.

854
01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.320
If a bloodsucker moves into town,
and the fever sets in.

855
01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.920
Mono?

856
01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.160
Yeah, I wish.

857
01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:06.320
You can't find a way to stop?

858
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.400
I mean it's wrong.

859
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.720
It's not a life-style choice, Bella.

860
01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.600
I was born this way,
I can't help it.

861
01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:19.880
You are such a hypocrite.

862
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.000
What, I'm not the
right kind of monster for you?

863
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.200
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.

864
01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.280
They never hurt anybody.

865
01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.640
You killed people, Jake.

866
01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.720
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

867
01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.720
Then, who is?

868
01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.600
We're trying to protect
you people from them.

869
01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:43.480
The only thing we do kill.

870
01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.360
Vampires.

871
01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.080
Jake, you can't...

872
01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.640
Don't worry, we can't touch your
little precious Cullens.

873
01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.440
Unless they violate the Treaty.

874
01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.640
It's not what I'm saying.

875
01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.840
You can't kill vampires, though.

876
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.800
They will kill you.
- Really?

877
01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.960
We took out that leech with
the dreads easy enough.

878
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.840
Laurent?

879
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.040
And his redhead girlfriend is next.

880
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.200
Vic... Victoria is here?
- Was.

881
01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.600
We chased her all the way to the
Canadian border the other night.

882
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.200
But she keeps coming back.

883
01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.680
We don't know what she's after.
- I do.

884
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.640
Me.

885
01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.200
Don't worry,
we've got this place covered.

886
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.720
She wont get near you or Charlie.

887
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.360
But you gotta be careful.

888
01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:48.640
She's fast, you don't know,
how fast she is.

889
01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.200
You know, your lack of confidence
in us is a little insulting.

890
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.240
Alright, I better go.

891
01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.920
And you gotta go.
- Yeah.

892
01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.760
I got a vampire to kill.

893
01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.720
<i>Alice, I'm alright.</i>

894
01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.600
<i>Until I'm alone.</i>

895
01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.280
<i>And lately,
that's all the time.</i>

896
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.240
<i>Jacob's gone,
he's hunting for Victoria.</i>

897
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.560
<i>And Charlie is hunting Jacob.</i>

898
01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.240
<i>And you're gone.</i>

899
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.760
<i>And so is Edward.</i>

900
01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.200
<i>And I just have nothing now.</i>

901
01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.560
You got something, Harry?

902
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.880
Nope, nothing.

903
01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.880
<i>But I realize where I have to go,</i>

904
01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.240
<i>What I have to do
to see him again.</i>

905
01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.440
<i>Don't do this.</i>

906
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.240
You wanted me to be human.

907
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.560
Watch me.

908
01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:20.080
<i>Please? For me?</i>

909
01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.560
You won't stay with me
any other way.

910
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.080
<i>Bella. Please.</i>

911
01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.360
<i>Breathe!</i>

912
01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.600
<i>Breathe!</i>

913
01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.000
Come on, Bella.
Breathe.

914
01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.640
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?

915
01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.960
Jake.

916
01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:32.120
What the hell were you thinking, huh?

917
01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.680
I just needed to see something.

918
01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.400
Take her home.

919
01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.840
I'm gonna go help over at Harry's place.

920
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.960
What happened at Harry's?

921
01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.520
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

922
01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.320
Charlie and my Dad are at Harry's place
with his family.

923
01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.840
Is he okay?
- He's gone.

924
01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.120
Come on, I'll give you sØmething to dry
and drive you home.

925
01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.960
Hundred and eight degrees over here.

926
01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.480
God!

927
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.560
My hands are freezing.

928
01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.760
It must be nice, never getting cold.

929
01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.240
Its a wolf thing.
- It's not.

930
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.920
Its a Jacob thing.
Youre just warm.

931
01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.560
You're like, your own sun.

932
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.520
This is better.
Now that you know about me.

933
01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.840
But...?

934
01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.040
You saw what happened to Emily.

935
01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.960
Sam got angry,

936
01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.200
...lost it for a split second...

937
01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.680
...Em was standing too close.

938
01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.200
He will never be able
to take that back.

939
01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.000
What if I get mad at you?

940
01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.240
Sometimes...

941
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.080
I feel like, I'm gonna disappear.

942
01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.680
You need not hear it from me.

943
01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.520
But I always will.
You're not gonna loose yourself.

944
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.400
I won't let that happen.

945
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.960
How?

946
01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.800
I'll tell you all the time.

947
01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.360
How special you are.

948
01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:37.200
Thank you...

949
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.000
...for everything.

950
01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.600
Wait!

951
01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:52.280
There's a vampire.
- How do you know?

952
01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.440
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out.

953
01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.720
That's Carlisle's car!

954
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.400
Theyre here.

955
01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.240
Bella, it's a trick. Stop!

956
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.040
You gotta come with me.

957
01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.560
They won't hurt me.

958
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.880
If a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

959
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:17.120
The treaty says we can only
defend our own lands.

960
01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.960
I can't protect you here.
- Okay, it's okay. You don't have to.

961
01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.960
Youre about to cross a line.
- Then don't draw one.

962
01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.360
Please.

963
01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.080
Alice!
- You're dead!

964
01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.040
Bella?
- What are you...?

965
01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.680
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't believe you're here.

966
01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.840
Is... Is...?

967
01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.720
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?

968
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.760
What?
- I saw a vision of you.

969
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.840
You jumped off a cliff.

970
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.200
Why in the hell would you try
and kill yourself?

971
01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.720
I mean, what about Charlie? What about...?
- I didn't try to kill myself.

972
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.840
I was cliff jumping.

973
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.360
Recreationally!

974
01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.400
It was fun.

975
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.800
I have never met anyone more prone
to life-threatening idiocy.

976
01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.800
Did you... did you tell him?
- No.

977
01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.520
He only calls once in a few months.

978
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.080
He said he wants to be alone.

979
01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:49.880
Aw, what is that
God awful wet dog smell?

980
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.320
That's probably me.

981
01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.120
Or... it's Jacob.

982
01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.440
Jacob who?

983
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.000
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

984
01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.600
Ugh! Bella! Werewolf's are not
good company to keep!

985
01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.480
Speak for yourself.

986
01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.600
I had to see if you were safe.

987
01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.320
I thought you couldn't protect me here.

988
01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.680
Guess, I don't care.

989
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.600
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.

990
01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.120
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

991
01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.760
We're talking about
the other bloodsucker...

992
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.840
...who tried to kill Bella
because of you.

993
01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.920
Victoria?
- Yeah, Victoria has been around.

994
01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.080
I didn't see her.

995
01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.280
I didn't see you getting pulled out
of the water either.

996
01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:51.080
I can't see past you
and your pack of mutts!

997
01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:54.000
Don't get me upset.
- Hey, stop!

998
01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.800
Things are gonna get very ugly!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

999
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.480
I will give you a minute.

1000
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:16.040
You're going anywhere,
you're gonna come back, right?

1001
01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.040
As soon as you put the dog out.

1002
01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.240
Is he...?

1003
01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.440
Are there others?

1004
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.000
How many Cullens are here
and how long are they staying?

1005
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.840
No.

1006
01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.400
It's just Alice.

1007
01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.440
And she can stay
as long as she like.

1008
01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.440
Are the rest coming back?

1009
01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.440
No.

1010
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.680
Not that I know of.

1011
01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.160
Anything else?

1012
01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.880
That's it.

1013
01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.000
Well, if that's all, then you better go
run back to Sam.

1014
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.320
I have done it again.

1015
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.040
I keep breaking my promise.

1016
01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:33.280
We don't have to do this to each other.

1017
01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.680
Yes, we do.

1018
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.120
Bella...

1019
01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.040
Stay with me forever.

1020
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.240
Swan Residence.

1021
01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.880
He's not here right now.

1022
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.840
He's arranging a funeral.

1023
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.960
Who is that?

1024
01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.360
What?
- Always in the way.

1025
01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.360
Who was that?
- Bella, step back.

1026
01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.160
Jacob, who was that?
- Stop.

1027
01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.040
Bella, it's Edward.

1028
01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.520
He thinks you are dead.

1029
01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.240
Rosalie told him,
why I came here.

1030
01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:04.000
Why would you...?

1031
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.800
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1032
01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.800
He didn't ask for you.
- I don't care!

1033
01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.640
Bella, he's going to the Volturi.

1034
01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.240
He wants to die too.

1035
01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.240
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore, remember?

1036
01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.560
But I'm not gonna let him
kill himself out of guilt.

1037
01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.160
What about your Dad?

1038
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:25.960
I'm eighteen,

1039
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.280
I'm legally free to go.
And I left a note.

1040
01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.760
Please, Bella.

1041
01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.840
Just... stay here.

1042
01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.040
Not for Charlie.

1043
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.240
For me...

1044
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.720
I gotta go.

1045
01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.200
I'm begging you.

1046
01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.640
Please.

1047
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.920
Bye, Jacob.

1048
01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:10.600
Okay.

1049
01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.840
So you made up your mind?

1050
01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.160
I'm afraid your particular gifts...

1051
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.640
...are too valuable
to destroy.

1052
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.400
But if you're unhappy
with your lot,

1053
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.760
...join us.

1054
01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:31.120
We would be delighted
to utilize your skills.

1055
01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:34.360
Won't you consider
staying with us?

1056
01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.160
You know what will happen anyway.

1057
01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:41.160
Not without cause.

1058
01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.520
Such a waste.

1059
01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.920
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?

1060
01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.280
I figured, you wouldn't be
opposed to grand theft auto.

1061
01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.880
Not today.

1062
01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.200
What? What are you seeing?
- They refused him.

1063
01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:08.160
So...?
- He's gonna make a scene.

1064
01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:11.320
Show himself to the humans.
- No! When?

1065
01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.080
He's gonna wait until noon,
when the sun's at it's highest.

1066
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:21.040
Alice, you gotta hurry up.
- There's Volterra.

1067
01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.680
Why are they all in red?
- San Marcos Day festival.

1068
01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.720
They're commemorating the expulsion
of the vampires from the city.

1069
01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.120
It's the perfect setting.

1070
01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.720
The Volturi will never let him
get far enough to reveal himself.

1071
01:35:55.840 --> 01:36:00.160
We have 5 minutes.
- You know, Bella? Breathe.

1072
01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.040
Alice?!

1073
01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.320
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.

1074
01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.560
If I go, he will read my thoughts...

1075
01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.520
...he'll think I'm lying
and rush into it.

1076
01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.200
Where do I go?
- He'll be under the clock tower.

1077
01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.480
Go!

1078
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.520
No!

1079
01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.320
Heaven.

1080
01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.280
You have to move!

1081
01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.920
Open your eyes, look at me.
I'm alive.

1082
01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.280
You have to move!

1083
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.520
Bella?

1084
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.440
You're here.
- Yeah.

1085
01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.360
You're alive!

1086
01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.920
Yes.

1087
01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.320
I needed you to see me once.

1088
01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:58.560
You had to know that I was alive.
You didn't have to feel guilty or anything.

1089
01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:05.880
I can let you go now.

1090
01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.720
You never had to let it go.

1091
01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:17.120
I just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.

1092
01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.400
But you said...
- I lied.

1093
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.240
I had to lie
and you believe me so easily.

1094
01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.240
Because it doesn't make sense
for you to love me.

1095
01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:40.520
I'm nothing... human.
Nothing.

1096
01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:45.720
Bella, you're everything to me.

1097
01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.880
Everything.

1098
01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:16.480
I won't be needing your services
after all, gentlemen.

1099
01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.440
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1100
01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.800
No rules were broken.

1101
01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.960
Nevertheless, we should take this
conversation...

1102
01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.040
...to a more appropriate venue.

1103
01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:25.920
Fine.

1104
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.280
Bella, why don't you go enjoy
the rest of the festival?

1105
01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:32.600
The girl comes with us.
- No. You can go to hell.

1106
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.920
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.

1107
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.320
We wouldn't want to make a scene.

1108
01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.040
We wouldnt.

1109
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.240
Enough!

1110
01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.840
Jane.

1111
01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.840
Aro send me to see
what's taking so long.

1112
01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.480
Just do as she says.

1113
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.520
Go ahead.

1114
01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.960
Are you scared?

1115
01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.360
Are you?

1116
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.440
No.

1117
01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.360
Good afternoon.

1118
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.240
Is she human?
- Yes.

1119
01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:11.400
Does she know?
- Yes.

1120
01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:13.440
Then why would...

1121
01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.120
She wants to be...

1122
01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.520
And so she will be.
- Or dessert!

1123
01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.000
Sister, sent you out to get one
and you bring back two.

1124
01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.120
And a half.

1125
01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.360
Such a clever girl.

1126
01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:40.040
What a happy surprise!

1127
01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.640
Bella is alive after all.

1128
01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:47.360
Isn't that wonderful?

1129
01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.080
I love a happy ending.

1130
01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:56.240
They are so rare.

1131
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.560
"La Tua Cantante. "
'Your Singer'

1132
01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.440
Your blood appeals to you
so much...

1133
01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.240
...it makes me thirsty.

1134
01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:11.400
How can you stand
to be so close to her?

1135
01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.680
It's not without difficulty.
- Yes, I can see that.

1136
01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:20.360
Aro can read every thought
I ever had.

1137
01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.040
With one touch.

1138
01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:24.600
And now you know everything.

1139
01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.080
So, get on with it.

1140
01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:34.320
You're quite soul reader yourself, Edward.

1141
01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.680
Though...

1142
01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:39.640
...you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1143
01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.880
Fascinating!

1144
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.920
I would love to see if...

1145
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:53.800
...you are an exception
to my gifts, as well.

1146
01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.960
Would you do me the honor?

1147
01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.720
Interesting.

1148
01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.560
I see nothing.

1149
01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.520
I wonder if...

1150
01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.480
Let's see if she is immune
to all our powers.

1151
01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.240
Shall we, Jane?

1152
01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.240
No!
- Pain.

1153
01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.240
Stop!

1154
01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.760
Stop, please!
Stop!

1155
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.560
Stop!

1156
01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.760
Just stop hurting him, please!
Please!

1157
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.520
Jane?

1158
01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:16.040
Master?

1159
01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.840
Go ahead, my dear.

1160
01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.080
This may hurt just a little.

1161
01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:47.560
Remarkable!

1162
01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.040
She confounds us all.

1163
01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:56.080
So, what we do with you now?

1164
01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:59.760
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.

1165
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.640
She knows too much,
she's a liability.

1166
01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.160
That's true.

1167
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.760
Felix?

1168
01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:25.120
Please! No, no!
Please!

1169
01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:29.600
Kill me... kill me.

1170
01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:31.440
Not him.

1171
01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:44.880
How extraordinary.

1172
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.720
You would give up your life...

1173
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.120
...for someone like us.

1174
01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:53.200
A vampire.

1175
01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.800
A soulless monster.

1176
01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.800
Just get away from him!

1177
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:05.440
You don't know a thing...

1178
01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:08.440
...about his soul.

1179
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:16.160
Maybe it's one or the other.

1180
01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.040
This is a sadness.

1181
01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:27.040
If only it be your intention
to give her immortality.

1182
01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.800
Wait!

1183
01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:40.080
Bella will be one of us.

1184
01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:43.440
I've seen it.

1185
01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.200
I'll change her myself.

1186
01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.640
Mesmerizing!

1187
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.120
To see, what you have seen.

1188
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.320
Before it is happened.

1189
01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.160
Your gifts...

1190
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:35.600
...will make for an intriguing...

1191
01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:38.000
...immortal.

1192
01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:41.440
Isabella.

1193
01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.560
Go now.

1194
01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.040
Make your preparations.

1195
01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:52.400
Let's be done with this.

1196
01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:56.480
Heidi will arrive, any moment.

1197
01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.680
Thank you...

1198
01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.800
...for the visit.
- We'll return the favØr.

1199
01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.080
I would advise...

1200
01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.240
...that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.

1201
01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.200
Goodbye...

1202
01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.360
...my young friends.

1203
01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:21.040
<i>Nice fishing, Heidi.</i>

1204
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.440
<i>Yes, they do look rather juicy.</i>

1205
01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.520
<i>Save some for me.</i>

1206
01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:29.760
<i>This way, please.
Stay together.</i>

1207
01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.680
You're here.

1208
01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:01.400
You can sleep.

1209
01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:07.480
I'll still be here
when you wake up.

1210
01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:15.200
Bella, the only reason
that I left...

1211
01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.880
...was because I thought
I was protecting you.

1212
01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:23.680
I needed you to have a chance...

1213
01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:27.400
...at a normal, happy life.

1214
01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:33.320
It was so easy for you to leave.

1215
01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:39.680
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I've done in a 100 years.

1216
01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:48.160
I swear...

1217
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:52.480
I will never fail you again.

1218
01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:55.840
I'm so sorry.

1219
01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.760
Charlie's coming.
- Hey!

1220
01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.560
You okay?

1221
01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:07.400
Fine.

1222
01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:12.280
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1223
01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.840
Yeah, last time you said that
you took off.

1224
01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:17.120
I didn't see you for three days.

1225
01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:21.160
I'm really sorry, Dad.

1226
01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:26.760
Bella, do not ever do that
to me again.

1227
01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:30.480
Ever.

1228
01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.600
And you're grounded...

1229
01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.400
...for the rest of your life.

1230
01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.600
Okay.

1231
01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:52.440
I'm not technically breaking
any of his rules.

1232
01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:58.440
He did say, I couldn't take a step
inside through the door.

1233
01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:01.000
I came in through the window.

1234
01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:07.480
He's not going to forgive me easily.

1235
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.520
I know.

1236
01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.960
Can you?

1237
01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:20.480
I hope you can because...

1238
01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:24.080
I honestly don't know
how to live without you.

1239
01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:29.920
Come here.

1240
01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:51.520
Once Alice changes me,

1241
01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.440
...you can't get rid of me.

1242
01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:58.880
She won't need to change you.

1243
01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:02.640
There are always ways to keep
the Volturi in the dark.

1244
01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.360
No.

1245
01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:08.080
No!

1246
01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.280
You all know what I want.

1247
01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:22.160
And I know,
how much I'm asking for.

1248
01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:25.080
The only thing I can think of...
for...

1249
01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.920
...it to be fair is to just vote.

1250
01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:30.360
You don't know what you just...
- Just... shut up!

1251
01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.240
Alice?

1252
01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:36.000
I already consider you my sister.

1253
01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.720
Yes!
- Thank you.

1254
01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:43.280
I vote, yes.

1255
01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:47.920
It would be nice to not wanna
kill you all the time.

1256
01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:52.800
I'm sorry.

1257
01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:57.840
I'm really sorry, both of you,
for the way I've acted.

1258
01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:59.280
And I'm really grateful...

1259
01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.080
...that you were brave enough
to go and save my brother.

1260
01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:07.440
But this isn't a life
I would have chosen for myself.

1261
01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.040
And I wish that there had been
someone to vote no for me.

1262
01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.320
So... no.

1263
01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:21.160
I vote hell yeah!

1264
01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.440
We can pick a fight with
these Volturi's some other way.

1265
01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:28.040
I already consider you,
a part of the family.

1266
01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.680
Yes!

1267
01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:38.200
Why are you doing this to me?

1268
01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:43.400
You know what this means.
- You've chosen not to live without her,

1269
01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.440
...which leaves me no choice.

1270
01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.000
I won't lose my son.

1271
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:56.680
<i>I'll wait until after graduation...</i>

1272
01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:59.080
<i>...to make it easier on Charlie.</i>

1273
01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:06.000
I want you to be the one
to do it.

1274
01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:15.040
He wants to talk to me.

1275
01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.640
See, you're still alive for now.

1276
01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.040
He thinks, it's me keeping you away.

1277
01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.600
You stay the hell out of my head.

1278
01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.320
Jacob...

1279
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.240
...I know you have
something to say to me.

1280
01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:34.680
But I wanna say something to you first.
If that's alright?

1281
01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:38.400
Thank you.

1282
01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.960
Thank you for keeping
Bella alive when...

1283
01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.120
...I didnt.

1284
01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.080
No, you didn't.

1285
01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.880
And it wasn't for your benefit,
trust me.

1286
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.840
I'm still grateful.

1287
01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:55.640
But I'm here now.

1288
01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.520
And I'm not gonna leave her side
till she orders me away.

1289
01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:00.200
We'll see.

1290
01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:05.720
Hey, my turn to talk.

1291
01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.360
I'm here to remind you about
a key point in the Treaty.

1292
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:14.960
I haven't forgotten.

1293
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.600
What key point?

1294
01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:22.040
If any of them bites a human,
the truce is over.

1295
01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.120
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

1296
01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:27.920
No... No, I won't let you.

1297
01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:31.040
You're not gonna be
one of them, Bella.

1298
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:33.120
It's not up to you.

1299
01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:35.360
You know what we'll do to you.

1300
01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.880
I won't have choice.
- Bella, please come.

1301
01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:39.480
Wait.

1302
01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.320
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.

1303
01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:53.040
Jake...

1304
01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:01.200
I love you.

1305
01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.440
So, please...

1306
01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.640
DØn't make me choose.

1307
01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:21.240
Because it'll be him.

1308
01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:26.800
It's always been him.

1309
01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.960
Bella...

1310
01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.960
Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!

1311
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.520
Bella, get out of here.

1312
01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:56.040
Stop!

1313
01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.480
Stop!

1314
01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:02.480
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

1315
01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:23.440
Jake?

1316
01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:39.560
He's right.

1317
01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.320
You shouldn't become one of us.

1318
01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.520
I can't do this alone.

1319
01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:54.480
Then please just wait.

1320
02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:04.840
Just give me... five years.

1321
02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:11.560
It's too long.

1322
02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:17.840
Then, three?

1323
02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.880
You're so stubborn.

1324
02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:27.560
What are you waiting for?

1325
02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:40.400
I have one condition...

1326
02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:44.640
...if you want me
to do it myself.

1327
02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:50.320
What's the condition?

1328
02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.760
And then, forever.

1329
02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:56.560
That's what I'm asking.

1330
02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:10.080
Marry me, Bella.

1331
02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.200
