1
00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:39.580
Come on.

2
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.753
Right there.

3
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.570
Right there.

4
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.403
What?

5
00:00:58.883 --> 00:00:59.800
What is it?

6
00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:02.683
It's
Answer me!

7
00:01:02.683 --> 00:01:03.516
It's.

8
00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:04.598
I, I hear it.

9
00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:05.459
Watch out!

10
00:01:13.264 --> 00:01:14.097
Take me.

11
00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:16.913
Just take me instead.

12
00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:31.215
No.

13
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.710
Think they got all the squatters out?

14
00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.160
I don't know.

15
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.187
Let's go find out.

16
00:03:54.187 --> 00:03:56.348
Who could that be?

17
00:03:56.348 --> 00:03:57.506
Hi.

18
00:03:57.506 --> 00:03:58.383
Hi.

19
00:03:58.383 --> 00:03:59.804
So glad you're here.

20
00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:00.637
Me, too.

21
00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:01.470
Hi.

22
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.303
Hello, Wendy.
Hi, again.

23
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.803
Wow.

24
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.023
Group hug.

25
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.983
Any hug?

26
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.960
Okay, they're too hold for that.

27
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.970
Yeah, probably.

28
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.803
Uncle Donald.

29
00:04:16.803 --> 00:04:17.717
Ah, I got ya.

30
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:20.323
Nice place.

31
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.253
Thanks.

32
00:04:22.253 --> 00:04:23.086
You want to help us move some boxes?

33
00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:23.919
Yeah, sure.

34
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.760
Jamie, where'd you go?

35
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.763
You gotta help out.

36
00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:30.583
You know we'll never
get rid of them now?

37
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.033
Does this work?

38
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.573
No, not for a long time.

39
00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:45.086
It's still cool.

40
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.740
Hey, how are your videos going?

41
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.600
You still doing that?

42
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.900
My show?

43
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.102
Yeah.

44
00:04:52.102 --> 00:04:53.823
Did you catch a ghost yet?

45
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.753
Nope.

46
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.040
As long as you're having fun.

47
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.790
I'll catch a real ghost.

48
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.260
Don't you worry.

49
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.220
Sure you will.

50
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:06.530
But in the meantime,

51
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.863
could you help me get some
of those clothes upstairs?

52
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.960
Only because you asked so nicely.

53
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.030
Please.

54
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.193
I thank you.

55
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.943
Hey.

56
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.470
What are you writing a novel?

57
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.960
Almost there.

58
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.240
Let me guess, this is for
a girl you're interested in?

59
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.570
A girl, no.

60
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.720
Oh you're writing to more
than one girl at a time, huh?

61
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.930
They swipe right, I swipe right.

62
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.763
What a world.

63
00:06:15.763 --> 00:06:17.570
It used to be dates, now it's swipes.

64
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.403
How do you keep track of that?

65
00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:20.390
I mean, if you're talking
to more than one girl

66
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:21.710
what happens if you send the wrong message

67
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.560
to the wrong one?

68
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.450
Yeah, okay.

69
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.330
Didn't think of that, did you?

70
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.550
Here, why don't you put
that there behind you

71
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.300
while you mull that over, hot shot.

72
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.480
So what's up, man?

73
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.043
Nothing much.

74
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.200
Listen, I was gonna surprise you

75
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.790
but I got the same system you have,

76
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.200
the new one, so you and I
can play online together.

77
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.300
It's pretty frigging sweet, right?

78
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.950
Didn't know you played video games.

79
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.280
Oh yeah, you could say I dabble.

80
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.833
Right.

81
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.383
So, Charlie, listen.

82
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.410
I know things have been kind of different

83
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.603
for you and Jamie now.

84
00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:08.918
I mean, I miss my brother

85
00:07:08.918 --> 00:07:10.363
but for you guys, it's just.

86
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.820
All happened pretty quick.

87
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.270
Tough year for your mom, too.

88
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.090
Anyway, I know a little
a bit about the trouble

89
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.276
you had a few weeks back.

90
00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:25.109
Look, I really don't want

91
00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:26.127
to do this right now.

92
00:07:26.127 --> 00:07:26.960
I just, I just,

93
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.793
I just want you to know,

94
00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:29.910
I had a phase like that in my 20s, too.

95
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.440
I was angry at everyone and everything.

96
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.230
Yeah, I got into a lot of fights.

97
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.503
A lot.

98
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.463
I never won one fight.

99
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.557
Not even a single one.

100
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.330
Hey, did I ever tell you
about the pale blue dot?

101
00:07:50.756 --> 00:07:52.360
Pale?

102
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.760
Really?

103
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.920
I never.

104
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.960
Oh, well I gotta tell you now.

105
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.240
So, at the university, I got
all these students, right?

106
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.800
They're all stressing
out about their papers,

107
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.750
about their applications, their futures.

108
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.160
Like their whole lives.

109
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.527
Who they're gonna be.

110
00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:08.930
You know what I always tell 'em?

111
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.257
What?

112
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:12.200
I tell 'em one of my
all time favorite lessons.

113
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.660
It's the lesson that made me want

114
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.216
to study science in the first place.

115
00:08:16.216 --> 00:08:18.370
It's a lesson that my
science teacher taught me

116
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.570
about the pale blue dot.

117
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.920
So, basically the
concept is simple, right,

118
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.597
but it comes from one of
the greatest minds ever.

119
00:08:27.597 --> 00:08:30.870
The idea is, if you could see planet Earth

120
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.690
from far enough away,

121
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.030
you would see that it's
just this tiny speck

122
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.230
in a vast cosmic darkness.

123
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.863
It's just this tiny, pale blue dot.

124
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.783
That's it.

125
00:08:42.636 --> 00:08:44.310
Kinda makes you put things in perspective,

126
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.160
you know, I mean.

127
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.150
Think about everything
you know to be true,

128
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.420
who you are, your family.

129
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.190
How you could be better.

130
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.340
Maybe how your problems aren't as vast

131
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.790
as they might seem right now.

132
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.183
You know?

133
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.294
Anyway, you look it up.

134
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.100
Pale blue dot, you'll look it up?

135
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.030
Yeah, I mean it.

136
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.980
No, I will.

137
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.010
Oh, hey, I got something for you.

138
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.840
Your father's, now yours.

139
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.280
No, way.

140
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.630
Try it on.

141
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.880
I didn't know you had this.

142
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.833
Yeah, well.

143
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.680
I needed it but now I'm gonna pass it on.

144
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.100
This is the jacket he had on

145
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.200
the first time we went riding.

146
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.283
I was scared, you know,
afraid I'd fall off the back.

147
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.886
He said if I just held on tight enough,

148
00:09:43.886 --> 00:09:46.326
I'd have nothing to fear.

149
00:09:46.326 --> 00:09:48.073
Well now you got the
bike and the jacket.

150
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.770
Listen, don't forget I'm here

151
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.370
if you want to talk to me, okay?

152
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.940
For anything, that's what family's about.

153
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.773
That's here.

154
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.814
What was that?

155
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.660
Help, somebody.

156
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.493
Jamie.

157
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:09.984
Are you okay?

158
00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.060
Yeah, I just.

159
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.910
I got locked in there.

160
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.107
I sort of freaked out.

161
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.790
Jamie, honey.

162
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.623
There's...

163
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:19.973
There's no lock.

164
00:10:23.296 --> 00:10:25.915
You know.

165
00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:26.748
Sorry.

166
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.330
It's okay.

167
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.833
Another box.

168
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.700
Did you take what you want
from the pile in the cellar?

169
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.533
What pile?

170
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:09.930
The pile, the stuff, the boxes

171
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.790
that the last owners left.

172
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.660
We're taking from that?

173
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.873
Yeah, I got a lamp.

174
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.193
I need a lamp.

175
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.270
Everybody needs a lamp.

176
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.423
Oh and this triangle
symbol, it's recurring.

177
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.030
Whoever wrote this didn't
want to spell it out.

178
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.580
It's like it's written in code.

179
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.570
Yeah or complete gibberish.

180
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.135
Position matters.

181
00:12:57.135 --> 00:12:58.060
Well yeah.

182
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.683
Don't let it decide?

183
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.483
First is sight.

184
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.833
Second is hear.

185
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.783
Third is speak.

186
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.587
You gonna eat that one?

187
00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:24.759
Yeah get close,

188
00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:28.373
close as possible.

189
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.303
Read incantation.

190
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.530
Would you believe some of
this is written in Latin?

191
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.603
Okay.

192
00:13:45.013 --> 00:13:46.653
Would you believe I'm still hungry?

193
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.340
Did you hear that?

194
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.840
What?

195
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.110
The.

196
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.280
Scratching.

197
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.799
What?

198
00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:58.780
No, I don't hear anything.

199
00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.923
In the walls.

200
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:02.853
Oh, come on.

201
00:14:02.853 --> 00:14:04.010
Don't tell me we have mice or something.

202
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.313
I gotta call somebody.

203
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.723
Wen?

204
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.980
Wen.

205
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:16.813
Yeah?

206
00:14:16.813 --> 00:14:17.646
You okay?

207
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.960
Yeah.

208
00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.340
Okay.

209
00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.300
You know what, I'm gonna go upstairs,

210
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.133
get ready for bed.

211
00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:25.263
Cool?

212
00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:26.513
Cool.
Cool.

213
00:19:17.475 --> 00:19:18.392
I got it.

214
00:19:23.013 --> 00:19:23.960
Hey, Nancy.

215
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.793
Hey.

216
00:19:24.793 --> 00:19:25.738
Come on in.

217
00:19:25.738 --> 00:19:26.571
Thanks.

218
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.543
Wendy, Nancy's here.

219
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.533
Sorry.

220
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.480
Nancy, you're a lifesaver.

221
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.290
No problem at all.

222
00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.123
Nancy, good to see you

223
00:19:42.123 --> 00:19:42.956
but I need some more coffee.

224
00:19:42.956 --> 00:19:43.890
You want a cup?

225
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:44.930
No, but I get it.

226
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.910
Donuts, I made donuts.

227
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.500
No, I'm good.

228
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.485
No thanks, though.

229
00:19:49.485 --> 00:19:50.890
Wen?

230
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.233
Just eat 'em all myself.

231
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.180
Yup, I married him.

232
00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.730
Yes.
Weird, right?

233
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.853
Come on, come on.

234
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.170
I tried working my way
through the Wednesday

235
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.250
and Thursday classes

236
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.810
but no dice.

237
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.643
Don't worry.

238
00:20:15.643 --> 00:20:17.370
You must be so busy moving, anyway.

239
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.610
Let me grade 'em.

240
00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.393
Oh Nancy, I can't do that to you.

241
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.443
I just feel so.

242
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.570
I don't know.

243
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.520
You need to like, relax, you know,

244
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.330
hang out with your friends, whatever.

245
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.853
Be a 20 something.

246
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.470
I'm the boring old married one.

247
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.020
Wen, trust me, I'm looking for something

248
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.340
to keep me busy right now.

249
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.890
Let me grade them.

250
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.200
Are you okay?

251
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.033
Yeah, why?

252
00:20:48.033 --> 00:20:48.940
Are you sick?

253
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.470
No.

254
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.200
You love Donald's home made donuts.

255
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.050
Yeah, I'm just watching my figure.

256
00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:55.883
Why?

257
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.493
Brian and I, sort of, you know.

258
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.850
Oh, sorry, honey.

259
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.050
But why would you need
to watch your figure?

260
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.680
I think it was one of
the girls at the gym.

261
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.746
You know, one of the gym girls

262
00:21:13.746 --> 00:21:15.810
who takes a picture of herself

263
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.890
and posts it online,

264
00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.520
every time she's working
out while she's working out,

265
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.930
when she's making herself a smoothie.

266
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.490
You know, the kind of girl you want

267
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.807
to hit with your car?

268
00:21:24.807 --> 00:21:26.567
Wow.

269
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:28.413
Wow.
Yeah, yeah.

270
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:30.483
Yeah.

271
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.463
Listen.

272
00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.880
The right person for you

273
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.310
will see that you're smart, kind,

274
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.540
and drop dead gorgeous

275
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.940
and they won't need a picture to prove it.

276
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.133
Screw Brian.

277
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.410
This is why you rock

278
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.993
and also why I'm grading
these papers for you, Wen.

279
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.010
You drive a hard bargain.

280
00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.320
Listen, I sort of walked here, you know,

281
00:22:00.423 --> 00:22:03.110
exercise, so.

282
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.460
I'll give you a ride in.

283
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.510
Thanks.
Donald,

284
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.100
I'm heading out with Nancy.

285
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.270
Okay.

286
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.840
Let's go.

287
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.673
Okay.

288
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.363
Hello?

289
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.853
Wen?

290
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.013
Wendy, I'm home.

291
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:33.743
Honey?

292
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.103
Hi.
Hi.

293
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.547
When did you get here?

294
00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:43.413
You okay?

295
00:23:45.897 --> 00:23:46.980
I feel a little sick.

296
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.663
Oh, what's going on?

297
00:23:49.598 --> 00:23:51.765
I was gonna make dinner.

298
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.130
Oh no, you got a fever.

299
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.203
Okay, wow.

300
00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.370
You know, let me run upstairs

301
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.570
and change real quick,
I'll come back down.

302
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:01.403
I'm gonna take care of you.

303
00:24:01.403 --> 00:24:02.714
Okay, just.

304
00:24:02.714 --> 00:24:03.547
But I'm still gonna help with dinner.

305
00:24:03.547 --> 00:24:04.380
No, no, no.

306
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.213
I'm cooking.

307
00:24:05.213 --> 00:24:06.046
Just.

308
00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:31.999
Okay.

309
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.423
Babe, come on.

310
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.040
Step up, step up.

311
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.873
Okay.

312
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.593
I heard it in this house.

313
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.040
Let's go back to the hospital.

314
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:40.890
No, no, no, no.

315
00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.753
Listen to me.

316
00:26:44.949 --> 00:26:46.163
I heard it.

317
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:49.362
Please.

318
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.590
Sweetheart, you have
a really high fever.

319
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.003
You're just not yourself.

320
00:26:56.655 --> 00:26:57.488
I promise you.

321
00:27:01.316 --> 00:27:02.149
It's here.

322
00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:04.378
It's here.

323
00:27:08.871 --> 00:27:10.288
Right behind you.

324
00:27:13.629 --> 00:27:15.092
In the dark.

325
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:35.623
Hey guys.

326
00:28:35.623 --> 00:28:37.770
It's Jamie, back for another video

327
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.600
at the world famous Blood Shed

328
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.460
where it was said that
three women were killed.

329
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.950
They say there was so
much blood on the inside,

330
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.130
it painted the walls red.

331
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.220
Creepy.

332
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.480
Now, last week we went
to the ghoul school,

333
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.020
that sucked, I know.

334
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.330
Nothing there.

335
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.653
But this time I'm hoping
we've got something real.

336
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.630
Okay, I'm just gonna
ask you a few questions.

337
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:06.080
Don't be scared of my device.

338
00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.640
Right, so.

339
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.465
This is just an
electromagnetic field reader,

340
00:29:11.465 --> 00:29:13.790
so I can get a sense where you are

341
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.023
and talk to you.

342
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.440
And I'm recording you.

343
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.913
So, smile.

344
00:29:20.942 --> 00:29:22.290
Okay.

345
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.740
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

346
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.900
If the answer is yes,

347
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.990
take a step towards me

348
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.340
and my EMF will light up red

349
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.993
and if it's no step away.

350
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.679
Okay.

351
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.363
Are you a girl?

352
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.033
Are you a boy?

353
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.093
Okay, um.

354
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.933
Let's try something different.

355
00:29:54.804 --> 00:29:56.693
Are you happy I found you?

356
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.643
Are you upset I found you?

357
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.303
Okay.

358
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.973
Okay.

359
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.663
Am I bothering you?

360
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.403
Do you want me to leave?

361
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:27.863
No way.

362
00:30:31.671 --> 00:30:32.504
Proof.

363
00:31:49.802 --> 00:31:50.719
Aunt Wendy?

364
00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:58.613
Hey, Jamie.

365
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.310
What, slow down.

366
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:03.610
What happened?

367
00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.530
Why are you at my house?

368
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.363
Hang on.

369
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.643
What happened?

370
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.743
I'll be right there.

371
00:33:45.605 --> 00:33:46.522
Sweetheart.

372
00:33:54.623 --> 00:33:55.730
What happened?

373
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.080
At first she said one thing,

374
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.450
it was like she just
went completely blank.

375
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.903
She kept saying these two words to me.

376
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.773
Endless cruelties.

377
00:34:06.984 --> 00:34:09.399
And then...

378
00:34:09.399 --> 00:34:13.305
And then she seemed almost
like she couldn't breathe,

379
00:34:13.305 --> 00:34:15.880
then she just started screaming.

380
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.823
It will never end, it will never end.

381
00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:22.290
Let's get her back into bed.

382
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:23.123
Uncle Donald.

383
00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.137
What the hell is going on?

384
00:34:26.137 --> 00:34:27.387
I don't know.

385
00:34:29.342 --> 00:34:30.425
I don't know.

386
00:34:39.175 --> 00:34:40.220
I've heard of this before.

387
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.053
What?

388
00:34:41.053 --> 00:34:43.053
A ritual book like this.

389
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.182
Of course.

390
00:34:46.182 --> 00:34:48.100
It has to be done by a group of people

391
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.358
so the demon can't pray
on them individually.

392
00:34:50.358 --> 00:34:51.191
Demon.

393
00:34:51.191 --> 00:34:52.024
Individuals are weak.

394
00:34:52.024 --> 00:34:53.980
These forces can overwhelm a single person

395
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:54.863
but together.

396
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.670
Look, a triangle.

397
00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:00.880
Three sense divided into three people.

398
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.710
One person to see, another person to hear,

399
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.870
and another person to speak.

400
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.000
To do what?

401
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.540
Whatever is attacking at Wendy,

402
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.102
it's been here for a long time.

403
00:35:08.102 --> 00:35:10.700
The people who lived here before you guys,

404
00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.163
they were fighting it, too, with this.

405
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.350
Look, the ritual allows you to identify

406
00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:20.090
the demon using these
abilities, okay, these senses.

407
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.740
The book itself gives you a
list of known incantations

408
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.180
to banish the demon.

409
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.160
I've looked at all of this.

410
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.330
It's nonsense, it's just crazy scribbling.

411
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:28.910
No, they're instructions.

412
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.480
Jamie, you can't possibly believe

413
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.510
that any of this real.

414
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.846
Of course I do.

415
00:35:33.846 --> 00:35:36.090
Don't you, after what's happened here?

416
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.310
I mean, what more do you need?

417
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.650
The book is empty.

418
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.910
No, it's here it's just hidden.

419
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.770
That doesn't make any sense.

420
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:43.940
It does.

421
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.120
This is powerful stuff,

422
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.930
it can be dangerous, too, I'm sure.

423
00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.530
Never should have mentioned it.

424
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.973
We have to do the ritual.

425
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.580
Me, you, and Charlie.

426
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.840
No.

427
00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.230
Please let me do this for her.

428
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.260
No.
Uncle Donald.

429
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.953
Absolutely not!

430
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.223
Fine.

431
00:36:05.729 --> 00:36:08.340
But at least let me stay the night.

432
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.540
It would make me feel
better to be close by.

433
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.773
Fine.

434
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.483
Hey.
Hey, Charlie.

435
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.520
Jamie seemed pretty upset on the phone.

436
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.473
You okay?

437
00:36:36.293 --> 00:36:37.430
Well, where is she?

438
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:38.780
Fell asleep on the couch.

439
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.992
She asked me for stuff.

440
00:36:41.992 --> 00:36:43.740
Got her clothes and a toothbrush.

441
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.573
Good.

442
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.080
Can I see Aunt Wendy?

443
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:51.663
Sure.

444
00:37:11.556 --> 00:37:12.771
What the hell?

445
00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:15.190
What happened, what happened to her hand?

446
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.360
It's kind of a long story.

447
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.700
We gotta take her to
the hospital or something.

448
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.260
I took her already, twice.

449
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.140
And what did they say?

450
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.290
It's not that simple.

451
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.623
Did you tell mom?

452
00:37:32.788 --> 00:37:34.330
Look, I don't understand.

453
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.748
What's happening, what are
you not telling me here?

454
00:38:39.347 --> 00:38:40.300
Hi, Nancy.

455
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.133
You're here late.

456
00:38:41.133 --> 00:38:42.320
Oh, I finished the grading.

457
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.870
I swear these kids
forget what the paper was

458
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:45.070
about halfway through.

459
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.483
Listen, Wendy, she's.

460
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.470
She's kinda under the weather.

461
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:53.303
So, uh.

462
00:38:53.303 --> 00:38:54.670
I don't want to be rude,

463
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.410
but I have to see her
about something here.

464
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.250
It will only take a minute.

465
00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.093
I don't know.

466
00:39:00.025 --> 00:39:00.858
Hey.

467
00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:02.963
Hi.

468
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.570
Charlie.
Nancy.

469
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:07.740
You work with my aunt?

470
00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.330
Yeah, a graduate assistant.

471
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.900
Very cool.

472
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.680
You want me to take those for you?

473
00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.523
Yeah, sure.

474
00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.610
Like I said, she's not
going to be able to talk,

475
00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.220
she's on some heavy pain medication.

476
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.630
Oh, geeze, is she okay?

477
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.217
No.

478
00:39:26.217 --> 00:39:28.133
I mean, not really.

479
00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.700
Is there anything I can do?

480
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.250
No, I'm gonna stay
and help out where I can

481
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.893
but I think we're cool.

482
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.220
That's nice of you.

483
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.640
Okay, so thank you.

484
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.600
Have a great night, thanks.

485
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.433
Sorry about this

486
00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:46.920
and I'm sure that Wendy's really going

487
00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.035
to appreciate all the hard work.

488
00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:51.411
Oh, no problem, okay.

489
00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:55.100
Um, what, what was that?

490
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:55.963
I have no idea.

491
00:39:57.414 --> 00:40:02.414
I got it.

492
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.023
Come on.

493
00:40:06.023 --> 00:40:07.830
What you got a security
system or something?

494
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:08.970
No, we don't have.

495
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.870
It's not locked, what's wrong with it?

496
00:40:14.693 --> 00:40:16.372
It's stuck.

497
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.633
Great.

498
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.510
My phones dead and I
charged it, I know I did.

499
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.190
Me, too.

500
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.650
I was gonna use it for the phone light.

501
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:37.700
Okay, that's weird.

502
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.620
Uh, I'm gonna go check
the breaker, I guess.

503
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.720
I'll check the back.

504
00:40:43.763 --> 00:40:44.763
I'll come.

505
00:40:53.213 --> 00:40:54.537
What's it looking like?

506
00:40:54.537 --> 00:40:56.787
All right here, let me try.

507
00:41:02.761 --> 00:41:03.594
Come on.

508
00:41:05.236 --> 00:41:06.403
What the hell?

509
00:41:12.651 --> 00:41:13.568
Aunt Wendy?

510
00:41:18.274 --> 00:41:19.274
Is that you?

511
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.313
Hey.

512
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.803
Get it open?

513
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.210
Is there someone else in the house?

514
00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.043
What?

515
00:41:37.043 --> 00:41:37.933
No, it's just us.

516
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.230
Hey.

517
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.530
So um...

518
00:41:47.609 --> 00:41:50.223
I have to tell you guys something.

519
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.800
Why didn't you listen to me?

520
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.520
I had to help her.

521
00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.590
You didn't believe in it, so.

522
00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.120
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

523
00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.210
I just wanted to help her.

524
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.043
All right, all right.

525
00:42:03.043 --> 00:42:04.150
Can somebody explain to me

526
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.790
what kind of weird shit is happening here?

527
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.523
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.420
Your Aunt Wendy found
this book in the basement

529
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.950
and since then, weird
stuff has been happening.

530
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.223
What's in the book?

531
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.670
A ritual to banish demons.

532
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.430
You need three people to do it.

533
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.630
Jamie believes that there's something

534
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:25.400
in the house with us.

535
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.610
A demonic force.

536
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:27.473
Yeah, that.

537
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.680
I did the ritual.

538
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.880
I was trying to force you guys to do it

539
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.214
by starting it myself, I'm sorry,

540
00:42:35.214 --> 00:42:37.550
and Nancy I'm really sorry to you

541
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:38.790
because I didn't know you would

542
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.371
be coming over tonight.

543
00:42:40.371 --> 00:42:41.204
Okay, all right.

544
00:42:41.204 --> 00:42:42.798
So what do we need three people for?

545
00:42:42.798 --> 00:42:45.780
The book needs you to identify the demon

546
00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.800
before you can banish it

547
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.953
and in order to do that,

548
00:42:48.953 --> 00:42:51.543
you need to find the proper incantation.

549
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.800
There's three abilities
divided to three people.

550
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.750
One person to see the demon,

551
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.230
another person to hear the demon,

552
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.110
and another to speak the demon's language.

553
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.120
Show them the book, Uncle Donald.

554
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.100
Here it is.

555
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.050
We still haven't figured it out, its...

556
00:43:09.341 --> 00:43:10.174
What?

557
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:13.660
What?

558
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.293
No, there's text there now.

559
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.360
In Latin and I can understand it

560
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.863
and I don't speak Latin.

561
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.080
How is this possible?

562
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.560
It still looks empty to me.

563
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.393
Me, too.

564
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.350
That's mean you can speak the language.

565
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:36.350
So, either Charlie or I can hear

566
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.473
or see the demon.

567
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:39.340
You don't know?

568
00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:19.733
Nothing.

569
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:23.640
Should we find a flashlight?

570
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.139
Yeah, there in here.

571
00:44:25.139 --> 00:44:25.972
I got 'em.

572
00:44:25.972 --> 00:44:27.055
I'm coming.

573
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.790
I know they're somewhere in here.

574
00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:52.903
Found one.

575
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.693
Look.

576
00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.163
Look, I know this is some weird shit.

577
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:04.990
But I'm really sorry you
got caught up in this.

578
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.090
Let's just keep looking for flashlights.

579
00:45:26.818 --> 00:45:28.318
You okay, Jamie?

580
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.410
I have this terrible feeling.

581
00:45:34.107 --> 00:45:34.940
What?

582
00:45:36.966 --> 00:45:39.216
Like we're being watched.

583
00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:47.680
I think somethings in here.

584
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:50.703
In here?

585
00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:54.133
Can you see it?

586
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:57.720
I see something.

587
00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:12.416
I'm getting it this time.

588
00:46:31.888 --> 00:46:33.805
Charlie, what was it?

589
00:46:36.941 --> 00:46:39.358
That came from the kitchen.

590
00:47:00.612 --> 00:47:02.184
What the hell?

591
00:47:02.184 --> 00:47:04.434
What's going on, Charlie?

592
00:47:05.313 --> 00:47:06.606
Did you guys hear that?

593
00:47:06.606 --> 00:47:08.166
What?

594
00:47:08.166 --> 00:47:10.510
I don't hear anything.

595
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.080
Neither do I.

596
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.280
I think I'm hearing
things you guys can't.

597
00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.613
Where's Jamie?

598
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:26.903
Jamie?

599
00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.243
You okay?

600
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.233
Right there.

601
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.163
Can you see that?

602
00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.413
I can see.

603
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.400
I can see.

604
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.800
That means Charlie can hear.

605
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.343
What do you see?

606
00:47:50.049 --> 00:47:53.153
Like a symbol.

607
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:55.850
What kind of symbol?

608
00:47:58.343 --> 00:47:59.453
Maybe a warning.

609
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.513
It won't go away.

610
00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.093
I can see it everywhere.

611
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:10.043
It's okay.

612
00:48:10.043 --> 00:48:11.846
I can see it when I close my eyes.

613
00:48:11.846 --> 00:48:14.545
It's okay, it's okay.

614
00:48:14.545 --> 00:48:15.378
Just sit down.

615
00:48:15.378 --> 00:48:16.262
It's okay.

616
00:48:16.262 --> 00:48:17.530
It's gonna be okay.

617
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.140
Maybe she can
trace on a piece of paper?

618
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:20.830
That's a good idea.

619
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.153
Look on the shelf, see if there's a pen.

620
00:48:23.153 --> 00:48:24.990
You think you could recreate it?

621
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.990
Yeah.

622
00:50:14.708 --> 00:50:15.541
Oh fuck.

623
00:53:00.592 --> 00:53:03.943
What happened?

624
00:53:03.943 --> 00:53:05.284
Charlie, what happened?

625
00:53:05.284 --> 00:53:06.563
What happened to you?

626
00:53:09.226 --> 00:53:11.638
You, you don't want to know.

627
00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:14.853
Upstairs.

628
00:53:14.853 --> 00:53:16.040
Upstairs what?

629
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.250
There's footsteps coming from upstairs.

630
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:21.460
Wendy, we gotta go check on Wendy.

631
00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:22.293
Go, go.

632
00:53:23.476 --> 00:53:24.513
Uncle Donald.

633
00:53:24.513 --> 00:53:27.203
That thing you said to me earlier,

634
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.193
the pale blue dot.

635
00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.213
Thank you.

636
00:53:31.213 --> 00:53:33.030
Gonna be okay, Charlie.

637
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.863
Come on.

638
00:53:42.606 --> 00:53:43.439
Stop.

639
00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:47.120
I think there's something in there.

640
00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.089
Shit.

641
00:53:59.089 --> 00:54:00.491
It's right there.

642
00:54:00.491 --> 00:54:01.333
It's okay.

643
00:54:01.333 --> 00:54:02.303
It's okay.

644
00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.490
I don't hear it.

645
00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:06.383
I can't see it.

646
00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:09.610
Jamie, can you describe it?

647
00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:10.443
What do you see?

648
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:13.263
I don't know.

649
00:54:13.263 --> 00:54:14.096
Just try.

650
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:19.113
Thin long man in robes.

651
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:21.860
What else?

652
00:54:24.396 --> 00:54:26.640
They're tattered robes.

653
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.041
Um just tall, very tall.

654
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:30.663
Like almost like a shadow.

655
00:54:32.278 --> 00:54:33.111
Nothing.

656
00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.233
Donald.

657
00:55:06.233 --> 00:55:07.780
Donald!

658
00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.613
Come on.

659
00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.265
Charlie, open the door.

660
00:55:12.265 --> 00:55:13.190
Donald.
Charlie.

661
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:14.483
Donald!

662
00:55:14.483 --> 00:55:15.316
All right.

663
00:55:15.316 --> 00:55:16.907
I'll find a way out.
Jamie.

664
00:55:16.907 --> 00:55:17.984
Jamie.

665
00:55:17.984 --> 00:55:18.817
Jamie, come here.

666
00:55:18.817 --> 00:55:19.650
Look, I can't hear the sounds

667
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:20.483
and I can't see it.

668
00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:22.100
You gotta tell me where it is, all right?

669
00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.467
Please, just breathe through it.

670
00:55:23.467 --> 00:55:24.886
Breathe through.

671
00:55:24.886 --> 00:55:26.240
What do you see?

672
00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.403
What do you see?

673
00:55:48.962 --> 00:55:49.962
Oh my god.

674
00:55:52.096 --> 00:55:53.016
Charlie!

675
00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:53.849
Jamie.

676
00:55:59.848 --> 00:56:00.681
Jamie!

677
00:56:00.681 --> 00:56:02.181
Jamie, I'm coming.

678
00:56:05.471 --> 00:56:06.916
No, no, no.

679
00:56:06.916 --> 00:56:08.257
I can't get it.

680
00:56:08.257 --> 00:56:09.254
Go get Jamie.

681
00:56:09.254 --> 00:56:10.087
Okay.

682
00:56:10.087 --> 00:56:10.920
Just don't let her...

683
00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.267
I'm going to go get something.

684
00:56:12.267 --> 00:56:14.350
Okay, I got it, I got it.

685
00:56:24.307 --> 00:56:26.584
Door, the door, come on.

686
00:56:26.584 --> 00:56:28.501
How do I open the door?

687
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.093
Charlie!

688
00:57:55.662 --> 00:57:56.579
Aunt Wendy?

689
00:59:22.208 --> 00:59:23.041
Charlie.

690
00:59:24.162 --> 00:59:26.010
Oh, oh Jesus.

691
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:26.843
Come on.

692
00:59:26.843 --> 00:59:27.940
My fucking shoulder hurts.

693
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.023
Okay, okay.

694
00:59:30.753 --> 00:59:32.260
You get Jamie, get Jamie.

695
00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.000
I'll get Nancy.
Help.

696
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.833
Help me!
Nancy.

697
00:59:36.103 --> 00:59:37.405
Nancy.
Please help me!

698
00:59:37.405 --> 00:59:39.487
Please help me!

699
00:59:43.028 --> 00:59:44.031
Okay, okay, it's okay.

700
00:59:44.031 --> 00:59:45.385
It's okay.

701
00:59:45.385 --> 00:59:46.468
It's okay.

702
00:59:46.468 --> 00:59:48.047
It's gonna be okay.

703
00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.960
I'm gonna get something
to stop the bleeding.

704
00:59:57.463 --> 00:59:58.296
Jamie.

705
01:00:10.354 --> 01:00:11.187
Jamie?

706
01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:20.028
Jamie.

707
01:00:24.693 --> 01:00:27.056
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

708
01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.723
We're gonna be okay.

709
01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.690
The book says the candle will burn red

710
01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:45.000
if Wendy's soul is taken.

711
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.310
Do we know what the demon is yet?

712
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.410
I know what it sounds like.

713
01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.620
What?

714
01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.390
I hear a low
pitched hum when it's near.

715
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:51.568
I know that.
Okay.

716
01:00:51.568 --> 01:00:52.401
All right.
But I don't

717
01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:53.234
hear it every time.

718
01:00:53.234 --> 01:00:54.067
What do you mean?

719
01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.260
I mean, it was right next

720
01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.790
to us upstairs and I didn't hear a thing.

721
01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.100
So it doesn't hum all the time?

722
01:00:58.100 --> 01:00:58.933
Right.

723
01:00:58.933 --> 01:01:00.450
Uh, a voice, a voice.

724
01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:01.500
Maybe you don't hear it all the time

725
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.110
because sometimes it's a voice?

726
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:04.584
What about what Jamie saw?

727
01:01:04.584 --> 01:01:07.980
She said it was a
tall, thin man in robes.

728
01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:08.984
There's something like that here.

729
01:01:08.984 --> 01:01:12.380
Tall, tattered robes.

730
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.750
Low religious chant.

731
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:16.323
The name of the demon

732
01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:19.049
Jamie!

733
01:01:19.049 --> 01:01:19.882
Jamie.

734
01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:22.173
Jamie!

735
01:01:28.757 --> 01:01:29.674
We can't leave him.

736
01:01:29.674 --> 01:01:31.190
We need to worry about getting ourselves

737
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.590
out of here right now, okay?

738
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:51.743
Donald?

739
01:03:58.990 --> 01:03:59.823
Donald?

740
01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.373
Screw this.

741
01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:08.995
Hey, I gotcha ya.

742
01:04:09.922 --> 01:04:11.300
Hey, hey, hey.

743
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.133
It's okay, it's okay.

744
01:04:12.133 --> 01:04:12.966
We gotta keep pressure on it.

745
01:04:12.966 --> 01:04:14.084
We gotta keep pressure on it.

746
01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:15.204
It's fine, it's fine, it's okay.

747
01:04:15.204 --> 01:04:16.037
Charlie, this

748
01:04:16.037 --> 01:04:17.040
You're gonna be fine.

749
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.300
You have to use the book to banish it.

750
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.750
What are you talking about?

751
01:04:21.097 --> 01:04:22.400
Its name, I know its name.

752
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.060
What, it doesn't matter.

753
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.082
It doesn't matter.

754
01:04:25.082 --> 01:04:27.505
The name is Sullumeg.

755
01:04:27.505 --> 01:04:28.338
What?

756
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:31.463
No, no, no.

757
01:04:31.463 --> 01:04:33.083
We need to keep pressure on it, stop.

758
01:04:34.443 --> 01:04:35.782
What are you doing?

759
01:04:35.782 --> 01:04:36.704
Listen to me.

760
01:04:36.704 --> 01:04:38.497
Listen to me.

761
01:04:38.497 --> 01:04:40.520
You're gonna need all my blood to do it.

762
01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.445
It won't work without it.

763
01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:44.443
Charlie.

764
01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:48.090
Hey, remember.

765
01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:49.923
Hey, hey.

766
01:04:50.822 --> 01:04:51.663
Look at me.

767
01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.806
You remember about the pale blue dot?

768
01:04:57.363 --> 01:05:00.737
It's all, it's all just a vast darkness

769
01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.523
and this is just one little speck.

770
01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:10.172
Donald?

771
01:05:12.045 --> 01:05:12.878
Donald?

772
01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.421
Uncle Donald, Donald, Donald.

773
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:16.338
Look at me.

774
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:18.053
Please wake up.

775
01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:27.923
It's okay, Jamie.

776
01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.624
It's okay, it's okay.

777
01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:42.970
I hear it.

778
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.120
Downstairs, we have to go now.

779
01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.987
What?
He gave me his name.

780
01:05:45.987 --> 01:05:47.200
What do we do?

781
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.050
We do it again.

782
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:50.200
This time with you.

783
01:06:01.807 --> 01:06:02.640
Hurry!

784
01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.940
Come on.

785
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:11.263
I can read it.

786
01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:12.943
I can read it.

787
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.800
It's there.

788
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.508
Charlie, watch out.

789
01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:29.335
Charlie.

790
01:06:29.335 --> 01:06:30.811
Charlie.

791
01:06:37.675 --> 01:06:38.694
Don't do it yet, Nancy.

792
01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.192
Wait until it gets closer.

793
01:06:40.192 --> 01:06:41.237
What, what about Charlie?

794
01:06:41.237 --> 01:06:43.038
We have and wait until it gets closer.

795
01:06:43.038 --> 01:06:44.037
We have to do it.

796
01:06:44.037 --> 01:06:45.536
Nancy, just wait.

797
01:06:58.847 --> 01:07:00.680
Now, Nancy, do it now.

798
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:39.523
Her fevers gone.

799
01:07:46.054 --> 01:07:47.613
You're probably better off down here.

800
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.430
This whole fucking house
gives me the creeps.

801
01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:56.530
I hope she'll be okay.

802
01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.283
Me, too.

803
01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:16.923
Yeah?

804
01:08:16.923 --> 01:08:17.947
I'm sorry about Donald.

805
01:08:24.755 --> 01:08:26.930
What should we do with this?

806
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.050
Burn it.

807
01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:28.883
Sounds good.

808
01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.690
I thought the effects of the ritual

809
01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:41.020
were supposed to wear off.

810
01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:41.900
I don't know.

811
01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:42.733
Why?

812
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.945
'Cause I can still read it.

813
01:08:45.945 --> 01:08:46.778
What?

814
01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:52.464
Gemullus.

815
01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.163
We had it wrong.

816
01:08:55.163 --> 01:08:56.815
It's Gemullus.

817
01:08:56.815 --> 01:08:57.833
What do you mean?

818
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:01.370
The book, it gave us the word

819
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.150
but it was backwards.

820
01:09:03.150 --> 01:09:04.450
What?

821
01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:06.050
It gave us Gemullus,

822
01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:08.253
which means twin in Latin.

823
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:14.809
Um, it says some demons
come in identical pairs

824
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:17.240
and they are impossible to tell apart

825
01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.343
based on looks on alone
and harder to banish.

826
01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.970
It's saying the only way to distinguish

827
01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:29.080
the two demons is by
the tone of their voice.

828
01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.070
One demon has a low pitched voice,

829
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.903
the other has

830
01:09:31.903 --> 01:09:32.736
A pitched one.

831
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:36.180
Yeah.

832
01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.013
You heard that?

833
01:09:37.013 --> 01:09:37.846
You heard two demons?

834
01:09:37.846 --> 01:09:39.770
I don't know, maybe.

835
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:42.640
In order to banish two identical demons,

836
01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.680
the same incantation
has to be read forward

837
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.010
and in reverse.

838
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:48.550
Or one of the demons will remain,

839
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:50.350
tethered to the world of the living.

840
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.543
One of them will be in our world forever.

841
01:09:59.080 --> 01:09:59.993
We did it wrong.

842
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.883
Where's Jamie?

843
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.633
You look down here.

844
01:10:08.633 --> 01:10:09.780
I'll look upstairs.
Jamie!

845
01:10:10.857 --> 01:10:11.690
Jamie!

846
01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.273
Jamie.

847
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:41.923
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

848
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:53.840
Jamie.

849
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.673
Jamie!

850
01:10:56.323 --> 01:10:57.593
What the fuck did you do?

851
01:11:01.815 --> 01:11:03.898
What the fuck did you do?

852
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:42.545
Jamie?
