1
00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:42.947
Come on.

2
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.120
Right there.

3
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.746
Right there.

4
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.770
What?

5
00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.083
What is it?

6
00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:05.859
- It's...
- Answer me!

7
00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:06.693
It's.

8
00:01:06.717 --> 00:01:07.774
I, I hear it.

9
00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:08.798
Watch out!

10
00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:17.464
Take me.

11
00:01:18.363 --> 00:01:20.113
Just take me instead.

12
00:02:33.307 --> 00:02:34.415
No.

13
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.910
Think they got all the squatters out?

14
00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:30.336
I don't know.

15
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.387
Let's go find out.

16
00:03:57.387 --> 00:03:59.524
Who could that be?

17
00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:00.682
Hi.

18
00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:01.560
Hi.

19
00:04:01.584 --> 00:04:02.980
So glad you're here.

20
00:04:03.004 --> 00:04:03.813
Me, too.

21
00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:04.646
Hi.

22
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.750
- Hello, Wendy.
- Hi, again.

23
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.170
Wow.

24
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360
Group hug.

25
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.350
Any hug?

26
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.136
Okay, they're too hold for that.

27
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.146
Yeah, probably.

28
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.979
Uncle Donald.

29
00:04:20.003 --> 00:04:21.003
Ah, I got ya.

30
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.690
Nice place.

31
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.429
Thanks.

32
00:04:25.453 --> 00:04:26.262
You want to help us move some boxes?

33
00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:27.286
Yeah, sure.

34
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.937
Jamie, where'd you go?

35
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.963
You gotta help out.

36
00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:33.855
You know we'll never
get rid of them now?

37
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.300
Does this work?

38
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.773
No, not for a long time.

39
00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:48.386
It's still cool.

40
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.916
Hey, how are your videos going?

41
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.777
You still doing that?

42
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:54.076
My show?

43
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.278
Yeah.

44
00:04:55.302 --> 00:04:57.023
Did you catch a ghost yet?

45
00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120
Nope.

46
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.216
As long as you're having fun.

47
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.966
I'll catch a real ghost.

48
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.436
Don't you worry.

49
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.460
Sure you will.

50
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.706
But in the meantime,

51
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.063
could you help me get some
of those clothes upstairs?

52
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.160
Only because you asked so nicely.

53
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.206
Please.

54
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.393
I thank you.

55
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.310
Hey.

56
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.646
What are you writing a novel?

57
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.136
Almost there.

58
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.416
Let me guess, this is for
a girl you're interested in?

59
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.746
A girl, no.

60
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.896
Oh you're writing to more
than one girl at a time, huh?

61
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.106
They swipe right, I swipe right.

62
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.940
What a world.

63
00:06:18.964 --> 00:06:20.746
It used to be dates, now it's swipes.

64
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.580
How do you keep track of that?

65
00:06:21.604 --> 00:06:23.566
I mean, if you're talking
to more than one girl

66
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.886
what happens if you send the wrong message

67
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:25.910
to the wrong one?

68
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.626
Yeah, okay.

69
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.507
Didn't think of that, did you?

70
00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:31.726
Here, why don't you put
that there behind you

71
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.500
while you mull that over, hot shot.

72
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.780
So what's up, man?

73
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.340
Nothing much.

74
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.376
Listen, I was gonna surprise you

75
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.966
but I got the same system you have,

76
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.376
the new one, so you and I
can play online together.

77
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.476
It's pretty frigging sweet, right?

78
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.126
Didn't know you played video games.

79
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.456
Oh yeah, you could say I dabble.

80
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.033
Right.

81
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.583
So, Charlie, listen.

82
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.586
I know things have been kind of different

83
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.803
for you and Jamie now.

84
00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:12.095
I mean, I miss my brother

85
00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:13.563
but for you guys, it's just.

86
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.996
All happened pretty quick.

87
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.470
Tough year for your mom, too.

88
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.266
Anyway, I know a little
a bit about the trouble

89
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.452
you had a few weeks back.

90
00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:28.286
Look, I really don't want

91
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.303
to do this right now.

92
00:07:29.327 --> 00:07:30.136
I just, I just,

93
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.970
I just want you to know,

94
00:07:30.994 --> 00:07:33.086
I had a phase like that in my 20s, too.

95
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.616
I was angry at everyone and everything.

96
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.406
Yeah, I got into a lot of fights.

97
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.703
A lot.

98
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.663
I never won one fight.

99
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:44.757
Not even a single one.

100
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.530
Hey, did I ever tell you
about the pale blue dot?

101
00:07:53.956 --> 00:07:55.536
Pale?

102
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.936
Really?

103
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.096
I never.

104
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.136
Oh, well I gotta tell you now.

105
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.416
So, at the university, I got
all these students, right?

106
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.976
They're all stressing
out about their papers,

107
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.926
about their applications, their futures.

108
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.336
Like their whole lives.

109
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.703
Who they're gonna be.

110
00:08:09.727 --> 00:08:12.106
You know what I always tell 'em?

111
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.433
What?

112
00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:15.376
I tell 'em one of my
all time favorite lessons.

113
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.836
It's the lesson that made me want

114
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.392
to study science in the first place.

115
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:21.546
It's a lesson that my
science teacher taught me

116
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.770
about the pale blue dot.

117
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.096
So, basically the
concept is simple, right,

118
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.773
but it comes from one of
the greatest minds ever.

119
00:08:30.797 --> 00:08:34.046
The idea is, if you could see planet Earth

120
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.866
from far enough away,

121
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.206
you would see that it's
just this tiny speck

122
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.406
in a vast cosmic darkness.

123
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.063
It's just this tiny, pale blue dot.

124
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.150
That's it.

125
00:08:45.836 --> 00:08:47.486
Kinda makes you put things in perspective,

126
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.510
you know, I mean.

127
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.326
Think about everything
you know to be true,

128
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.596
who you are, your family.

129
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.366
How you could be better.

130
00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.516
Maybe how your problems aren't as vast

131
00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.990
as they might seem right now.

132
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.550
You know?

133
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.470
Anyway, you look it up.

134
00:09:07.494 --> 00:09:09.276
Pale blue dot, you'll look it up?

135
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.206
Yeah, I mean it.

136
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.230
No, I will.

137
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.210
Oh, hey, I got something for you.

138
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.016
Your father's, now yours.

139
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.456
No, way.

140
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.806
Try it on.

141
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.056
I didn't know you had this.

142
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080
Yeah, well.

143
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.880
I needed it but now I'm gonna pass it on.

144
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.276
This is the jacket he had on

145
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.376
the first time we went riding.

146
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.483
I was scared, you know,
afraid I'd fall off the back.

147
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.062
He said if I just held on tight enough,

148
00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.502
I'd have nothing to fear.

149
00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:51.273
Well now you got the
bike and the jacket.

150
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.947
Listen, don't forget I'm here

151
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.570
if you want to talk to me, okay?

152
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.116
For anything, that's what family's about.

153
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.140
That's here.

154
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.014
What was that?

155
00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:09.836
Help, somebody.

156
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.860
Jamie.

157
00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:13.161
Are you okay?

158
00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:14.236
Yeah, I just.

159
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.087
I got locked in there.

160
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:16.307
I sort of freaked out.

161
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.966
Jamie, honey.

162
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.990
There's...

163
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.173
There's no lock.

164
00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:29.091
You know.

165
00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:30.115
Sorry.

166
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:33.530
It's okay.

167
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.200
Another box.

168
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.876
Did you take what you want
from the pile in the cellar?

169
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.900
What pile?

170
00:11:10.901 --> 00:11:13.106
The pile, the stuff, the boxes

171
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.966
that the last owners left.

172
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.837
We're taking from that?

173
00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:17.073
Yeah, I got a lamp.

174
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.393
I need a lamp.

175
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.470
Everybody needs a lamp.

176
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.623
Oh and this triangle
symbol, it's recurring.

177
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.206
Whoever wrote this didn't
want to spell it out.

178
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.756
It's like it's written in code.

179
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.746
Yeah or complete gibberish.

180
00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.311
Position matters.

181
00:13:00.335 --> 00:13:01.237
Well yeah.

182
00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:02.883
Don't let it decide?

183
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.683
First is sight.

184
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.033
Second is hear.

185
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.983
Third is speak.

186
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.787
You gonna eat that one?

187
00:13:26.335 --> 00:13:27.935
Yeah get close,

188
00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:31.573
close as possible.

189
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.503
Read incantation.

190
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.730
Would you believe some of
this is written in Latin?

191
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960
Okay.

192
00:13:48.213 --> 00:13:49.853
Would you believe I'm still hungry?

193
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.516
Did you hear that?

194
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.016
What?

195
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.286
The.

196
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.456
Scratching.

197
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.975
What?

198
00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:01.956
No, I don't hear anything.

199
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.123
In the walls.

200
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.030
Oh, come on.

201
00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:07.186
Don't tell me we have mice or something.

202
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.513
I gotta call somebody.

203
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.090
Wen?

204
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.156
Wen.

205
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.989
Yeah?

206
00:14:20.013 --> 00:14:21.013
You okay?

207
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.136
Yeah.

208
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.516
Okay.

209
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.476
You know what, I'm gonna go upstairs,

210
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.310
get ready for bed.

211
00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.439
Cool?

212
00:14:28.463 --> 00:14:29.713
- Cool.
- Cool.

213
00:19:20.675 --> 00:19:21.675
I got it.

214
00:19:26.213 --> 00:19:27.136
Hey, Nancy.

215
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.969
Hey.

216
00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:28.914
Come on in.

217
00:19:28.938 --> 00:19:29.938
Thanks.

218
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.743
Wendy, Nancy's here.

219
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.900
Sorry.

220
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.656
Nancy, you're a lifesaver.

221
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.466
No problem at all.

222
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.299
Nancy, good to see you

223
00:19:45.323 --> 00:19:46.132
but I need some more coffee.

224
00:19:46.156 --> 00:19:47.067
You want a cup?

225
00:19:47.091 --> 00:19:48.106
No, but I get it.

226
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.086
Donuts, I made donuts.

227
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.676
No, I'm good.

228
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.662
No thanks, though.

229
00:19:52.686 --> 00:19:54.066
Wen?

230
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.433
Just eat 'em all myself.

231
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.356
Yup, I married him.

232
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.906
- Yes.
- Weird, right?

233
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.053
Come on, come on.

234
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:10.370
I tried working my way
through the Wednesday

235
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.450
and Thursday classes

236
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.986
but no dice.

237
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:18.820
Don't worry.

238
00:20:18.844 --> 00:20:20.546
You must be so busy moving, anyway.

239
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:21.786
Let me grade 'em.

240
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.593
Oh Nancy, I can't do that to you.

241
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.643
I just feel so.

242
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.770
I don't know.

243
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.696
You need to like, relax, you know,

244
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.506
hang out with your friends, whatever.

245
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.053
Be a 20 something.

246
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.646
I'm the boring old married one.

247
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.196
Wen, trust me, I'm looking for something

248
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.516
to keep me busy right now.

249
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.066
Let me grade them.

250
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.376
Are you okay?

251
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.209
Yeah, why?

252
00:20:51.233 --> 00:20:52.117
Are you sick?

253
00:20:52.141 --> 00:20:53.646
No.

254
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.376
You love Donald's home made donuts.

255
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.226
Yeah, I'm just watching my figure.

256
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.250
Why?

257
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.693
Brian and I, sort of, you know.

258
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.026
Oh, sorry, honey.

259
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.250
But why would you need
to watch your figure?

260
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.856
I think it was one of
the girls at the gym.

261
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.922
You know, one of the gym girls

262
00:21:16.946 --> 00:21:18.986
who takes a picture of herself

263
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.066
and posts it online,

264
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.696
every time she's working
out while she's working out,

265
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.106
when she's making herself a smoothie.

266
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.666
You know, the kind of girl you want

267
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:27.983
to hit with your car?

268
00:21:28.007 --> 00:21:29.767
Wow.

269
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:31.770
- Wow.
- Yeah, yeah.

270
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:33.850
Yeah.

271
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.830
Listen.

272
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.056
The right person for you

273
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.486
will see that you're smart, kind,

274
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.716
and drop dead gorgeous

275
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.116
and they won't need a picture to prove it.

276
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.333
Screw Brian.

277
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.586
This is why you rock

278
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.193
and also why I'm grading
these papers for you, Wen.

279
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.210
You drive a hard bargain.

280
00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.520
Listen, I sort of walked here, you know,

281
00:22:03.623 --> 00:22:06.286
exercise, so.

282
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.636
I'll give you a ride in.

283
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.686
- Thanks.
- Donald,

284
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.276
I'm heading out with Nancy.

285
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.446
Okay.

286
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.016
Let's go.

287
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040
Okay.

288
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.730
Hello?

289
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.220
Wen?

290
00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.213
Wendy, I'm home.

291
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.110
Honey?

292
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.470
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.723
When did you get here?

294
00:23:45.747 --> 00:23:46.747
You okay?

295
00:23:49.097 --> 00:23:50.156
I feel a little sick.

296
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.863
Oh, what's going on?

297
00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:54.965
I was gonna make dinner.

298
00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.306
Oh no, you got a fever.

299
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.403
Okay, wow.

300
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.546
You know, let me run upstairs

301
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.746
and change real quick,
I'll come back down.

302
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.580
I'm gonna take care of you.

303
00:24:04.604 --> 00:24:05.890
Okay, just.

304
00:24:05.914 --> 00:24:06.723
But I'm still gonna help with dinner.

305
00:24:06.747 --> 00:24:07.556
No, no, no.

306
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.389
I'm cooking.

307
00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:09.413
Just.

308
00:25:30.199 --> 00:25:35.199
Okay.

309
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.623
Babe, come on.

310
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.216
Step up, step up.

311
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.240
Okay.

312
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.793
I heard it in this house.

313
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.216
Let's go back to the hospital.

314
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240
No, no, no, no.

315
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.953
Listen to me.

316
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:49.363
I heard it.

317
00:26:51.729 --> 00:26:52.729
Please.

318
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.766
Sweetheart, you have
a really high fever.

319
00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.203
You're just not yourself.

320
00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:00.855
I promise you.

321
00:27:04.516 --> 00:27:05.516
It's here.

322
00:27:06.572 --> 00:27:07.578
It's here.

323
00:27:12.071 --> 00:27:13.488
Right behind you.

324
00:27:16.829 --> 00:27:18.292
In the dark.

325
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.800
Hey guys.

326
00:28:38.824 --> 00:28:40.946
It's Jamie, back for another video

327
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.776
at the world famous Blood Shed

328
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.636
where it was said that
three women were killed.

329
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.126
They say there was so
much blood on the inside,

330
00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.306
it painted the walls red.

331
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.396
Creepy.

332
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.656
Now, last week we went
to the ghoul school,

333
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.196
that sucked, I know.

334
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.506
Nothing there.

335
00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.853
But this time I'm hoping
we've got something real.

336
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.806
Okay, I'm just gonna
ask you a few questions.

337
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.280
Don't be scared of my device.

338
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.816
Right, so.

339
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.641
This is just an
electromagnetic field reader,

340
00:29:14.665 --> 00:29:16.966
so I can get a sense where you are

341
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.223
and talk to you.

342
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.616
And I'm recording you.

343
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.113
So, smile.

344
00:29:24.142 --> 00:29:25.466
Okay.

345
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.916
I'm just gonna ask you a few questions.

346
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.076
If the answer is yes,

347
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.166
take a step towards me

348
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.516
and my EMF will light up red

349
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.193
and if it's no step away.

350
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.879
Okay.

351
00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.563
Are you a girl?

352
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.233
Are you a boy?

353
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.293
Okay, um.

354
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.133
Let's try something different.

355
00:29:58.004 --> 00:29:59.893
Are you happy I found you?

356
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:05.843
Are you upset I found you?

357
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.670
Okay.

358
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.340
Okay.

359
00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.863
Am I bothering you?

360
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.603
Do you want me to leave?

361
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.230
No way.

362
00:30:34.871 --> 00:30:35.871
Proof.

363
00:31:53.002 --> 00:31:54.002
Aunt Wendy?

364
00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.980
Hey, Jamie.

365
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.486
What, slow down.

366
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.786
What happened?

367
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.706
Why are you at my house?

368
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:09.730
Hang on.

369
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:19.843
What happened?

370
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.943
I'll be right there.

371
00:33:48.805 --> 00:33:49.805
Sweetheart.

372
00:33:57.823 --> 00:33:58.906
What happened?

373
00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.256
At first she said one thing,

374
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.626
it was like she just
went completely blank.

375
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.103
She kept saying these two words to me.

376
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.973
Endless cruelties.

377
00:34:10.184 --> 00:34:12.575
And then...

378
00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:16.481
And then she seemed almost
like she couldn't breathe,

379
00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:19.056
then she just started screaming.

380
00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.023
It will never end, it will never end.

381
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.466
Let's get her back into bed.

382
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:26.490
Uncle Donald.

383
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.313
What the hell is going on?

384
00:34:29.337 --> 00:34:30.587
I don't know.

385
00:34:32.542 --> 00:34:33.625
I don't know.

386
00:34:42.375 --> 00:34:43.396
I've heard of this before.

387
00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.230
What?

388
00:34:44.254 --> 00:34:46.253
A ritual book like this.

389
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.358
Of course.

390
00:34:49.382 --> 00:34:51.276
It has to be done by a group of people

391
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.534
so the demon can't pray
on them individually.

392
00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:54.367
Demon.

393
00:34:54.391 --> 00:34:55.201
Individuals are weak.

394
00:34:55.225 --> 00:34:57.156
These forces can overwhelm a single person

395
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.180
but together.

396
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.846
Look, a triangle.

397
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.056
Three sense divided into three people.

398
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.886
One person to see, another person to hear,

399
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:07.046
and another person to speak.

400
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.176
To do what?

401
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.716
Whatever is attacking at Wendy,

402
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.278
it's been here for a long time.

403
00:35:11.302 --> 00:35:13.876
The people who lived here before you guys,

404
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.363
they were fighting it, too, with this.

405
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.526
Look, the ritual allows you to identify

406
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:23.266
the demon using these
abilities, okay, these senses.

407
00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.916
The book itself gives you a
list of known incantations

408
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.356
to banish the demon.

409
00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.337
I've looked at all of this.

410
00:35:28.361 --> 00:35:30.506
It's nonsense, it's just crazy scribbling.

411
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.086
No, they're instructions.

412
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.656
Jamie, you can't possibly believe

413
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.686
that any of this real.

414
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.022
Of course I do.

415
00:35:37.046 --> 00:35:39.266
Don't you, after what's happened here?

416
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:40.486
I mean, what more do you need?

417
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:41.826
The book is empty.

418
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.086
No, it's here it's just hidden.

419
00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:45.947
That doesn't make any sense.

420
00:35:45.971 --> 00:35:47.116
It does.

421
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.296
This is powerful stuff,

422
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.106
it can be dangerous, too, I'm sure.

423
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.706
Never should have mentioned it.

424
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:54.173
We have to do the ritual.

425
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.756
Me, you, and Charlie.

426
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.016
No.

427
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.406
Please let me do this for her.

428
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:01.436
- No.
- Uncle Donald.

429
00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.153
Absolutely not!

430
00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.590
Fine.

431
00:36:08.929 --> 00:36:11.516
But at least let me stay the night.

432
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.740
It would make me feel
better to be close by.

433
00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.140
Fine.

434
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.683
- Hey.
- Hey, Charlie.

435
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.720
Jamie seemed pretty upset on the phone.

436
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840
You okay?

437
00:36:39.493 --> 00:36:40.606
Well, where is she?

438
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:41.980
Fell asleep on the couch.

439
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.168
She asked me for stuff.

440
00:36:45.192 --> 00:36:46.916
Got her clothes and a toothbrush.

441
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:47.940
Good.

442
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:52.280
Can I see Aunt Wendy?

443
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.030
Sure.

444
00:37:14.756 --> 00:37:15.947
What the hell?

445
00:37:15.971 --> 00:37:18.366
What happened, what happened to her hand?

446
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.536
It's kind of a long story.

447
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.876
We gotta take her to
the hospital or something.

448
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.436
I took her already, twice.

449
00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.316
And what did they say?

450
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.490
It's not that simple.

451
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.840
Did you tell mom?

452
00:37:35.988 --> 00:37:37.506
Look, I don't understand.

453
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.948
What's happening, what are
you not telling me here?

454
00:38:42.547 --> 00:38:43.476
Hi, Nancy.

455
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.310
You're here late.

456
00:38:44.334 --> 00:38:45.496
Oh, I finished the grading.

457
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.046
I swear these kids
forget what the paper was

458
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.270
about halfway through.

459
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.683
Listen, Wendy, she's.

460
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.646
She's kinda under the weather.

461
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:56.480
So, uh.

462
00:38:56.504 --> 00:38:57.846
I don't want to be rude,

463
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.586
but I have to see her
about something here.

464
00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:00.426
It will only take a minute.

465
00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:01.450
I don't know.

466
00:39:03.225 --> 00:39:04.225
Hey.

467
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:06.330
Hi.

468
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.746
- Charlie.
- Nancy.

469
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:10.916
You work with my aunt?

470
00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:12.506
Yeah, a graduate assistant.

471
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.076
Very cool.

472
00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.856
You want me to take those for you?

473
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.880
Yeah, sure.

474
00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.786
Like I said, she's not
going to be able to talk,

475
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.396
she's on some heavy pain medication.

476
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.806
Oh, geeze, is she okay?

477
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.393
- No.
- Uh.

478
00:39:29.417 --> 00:39:31.333
I mean, not really.

479
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.876
Is there anything I can do?

480
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.426
No, I'm gonna stay
and help out where I can

481
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.093
but I think we're cool.

482
00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:42.420
That's nice of you.

483
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.816
Okay, so thank you.

484
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.776
Have a great night, thanks.

485
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.610
Sorry about this

486
00:39:47.634 --> 00:39:50.096
and I'm sure that Wendy's really going

487
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.211
to appreciate all the hard work.

488
00:39:51.235 --> 00:39:54.611
Oh, no problem, okay.

489
00:39:56.174 --> 00:39:58.276
Um, what, what was that?

490
00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.300
I have no idea.

491
00:40:00.614 --> 00:40:05.614
I got it.

492
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:09.200
Come on.

493
00:40:09.224 --> 00:40:11.006
What you got a security
system or something?

494
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.146
No, we don't have.

495
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.070
It's not locked, what's wrong with it?

496
00:40:17.893 --> 00:40:19.572
It's stuck.

497
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Great.

498
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.710
My phones dead and I
charged it, I know I did.

499
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:37.366
Me, too.

500
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.826
I was gonna use it for the phone light.

501
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:40.900
Okay, that's weird.

502
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.796
Uh, I'm gonna go check
the breaker, I guess.

503
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.920
I'll check the back.

504
00:40:46.963 --> 00:40:47.963
I'll come.

505
00:40:56.413 --> 00:40:57.713
What's it looking like?

506
00:40:57.737 --> 00:40:59.987
All right here, let me try.

507
00:41:05.961 --> 00:41:06.961
Come on.

508
00:41:08.436 --> 00:41:09.603
What the hell?

509
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:16.851
Aunt Wendy?

510
00:41:21.474 --> 00:41:22.474
Is that you?

511
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.680
Hey.

512
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.170
Get it open?

513
00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.386
Is there someone else in the house?

514
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.219
What?

515
00:41:40.243 --> 00:41:41.243
No, it's just us.

516
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.406
Hey.

517
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.730
So um...

518
00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:53.423
I have to tell you guys something.

519
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.976
Why didn't you listen to me?

520
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.696
I had to help her.

521
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.766
You didn't believe in it, so.

522
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:04.296
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

523
00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.386
I just wanted to help her.

524
00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:06.220
All right, all right.

525
00:42:06.244 --> 00:42:07.326
Can somebody explain to me

526
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.966
what kind of weird shit is happening here?

527
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.723
Yeah, yeah.

528
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:15.596
Your Aunt Wendy found
this book in the basement

529
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.126
and since then, weird
stuff has been happening.

530
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.423
What's in the book?

531
00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.846
A ritual to banish demons.

532
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.606
You need three people to do it.

533
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:26.806
Jamie believes that there's something

534
00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.576
in the house with us.

535
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.786
A demonic force.

536
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:30.810
Yeah, that.

537
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.856
I did the ritual.

538
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.056
I was trying to force you guys to do it

539
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.390
by starting it myself, I'm sorry,

540
00:42:38.414 --> 00:42:40.726
and Nancy I'm really sorry to you

541
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:41.966
because I didn't know you would

542
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.547
be coming over tonight.

543
00:42:43.571 --> 00:42:44.381
Okay, all right.

544
00:42:44.405 --> 00:42:45.974
So what do we need three people for?

545
00:42:45.998 --> 00:42:48.956
The book needs you to identify the demon

546
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.976
before you can banish it

547
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.129
and in order to do that,

548
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:54.743
you need to find the proper incantation.

549
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.976
There's three abilities
divided to three people.

550
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.926
One person to see the demon,

551
00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.406
another person to hear the demon,

552
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:04.286
and another to speak the demon's language.

553
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.296
Show them the book, Uncle Donald.

554
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.277
Here it is.

555
00:43:07.301 --> 00:43:09.250
We still haven't figured it out, its...

556
00:43:12.541 --> 00:43:13.541
What?

557
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.010
What?

558
00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.493
No, there's text there now.

559
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.536
In Latin and I can understand it

560
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.063
and I don't speak Latin.

561
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.256
How is this possible?

562
00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.736
It still looks empty to me.

563
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760
Me, too.

564
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.526
That's mean you can speak the language.

565
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.526
So, either Charlie or I can hear

566
00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:40.673
or see the demon.

567
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:42.690
You don't know?

568
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.100
Nothing.

569
00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:26.816
Should we find a flashlight?

570
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.315
Yeah, there in here.

571
00:44:28.339 --> 00:44:29.149
I got 'em.

572
00:44:29.173 --> 00:44:30.255
I'm coming.

573
00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.990
I know they're somewhere in here.

574
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.270
Found one.

575
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.060
Look.

576
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.363
Look, I know this is some weird shit.

577
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.166
But I'm really sorry you
got caught up in this.

578
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.290
Let's just keep looking for flashlights.

579
00:45:30.018 --> 00:45:31.518
You okay, Jamie?

580
00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.610
I have this terrible feeling.

581
00:45:37.307 --> 00:45:38.307
What?

582
00:45:40.166 --> 00:45:42.416
Like we're being watched.

583
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:50.880
I think somethings in here.

584
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.070
In here?

585
00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.490
Can you see it?

586
00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.020
I see something.

587
00:46:13.366 --> 00:46:15.616
I'm getting it this time.

588
00:46:35.088 --> 00:46:37.005
Charlie, what was it?

589
00:46:40.141 --> 00:46:42.558
That came from the kitchen.

590
00:47:03.812 --> 00:47:05.360
What the hell?

591
00:47:05.384 --> 00:47:07.634
What's going on, Charlie?

592
00:47:08.513 --> 00:47:09.782
Did you guys hear that?

593
00:47:09.806 --> 00:47:11.342
What?

594
00:47:11.366 --> 00:47:13.686
I don't hear anything.

595
00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:15.256
Neither do I.

596
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.480
I think I'm hearing
things you guys can't.

597
00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.813
Where's Jamie?

598
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:30.270
Jamie?

599
00:47:31.567 --> 00:47:32.567
You okay?

600
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.600
Right there.

601
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.363
Can you see that?

602
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.780
I can see.

603
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:47.577
I can see.

604
00:47:47.601 --> 00:47:49.000
That means Charlie can hear.

605
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.543
What do you see?

606
00:47:53.249 --> 00:47:56.353
Like a symbol.

607
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:59.050
What kind of symbol?

608
00:48:01.543 --> 00:48:02.653
Maybe a warning.

609
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:07.713
It won't go away.

610
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.293
I can see it everywhere.

611
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:13.220
It's okay.

612
00:48:13.244 --> 00:48:15.022
I can see it when I close my eyes.

613
00:48:15.046 --> 00:48:17.721
It's okay, it's okay.

614
00:48:17.745 --> 00:48:18.554
Just sit down.

615
00:48:18.578 --> 00:48:19.439
It's okay.

616
00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:20.706
It's gonna be okay.

617
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.316
Maybe she can
trace on a piece of paper?

618
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.006
That's a good idea.

619
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.329
Look on the shelf, see if there's a pen.

620
00:48:26.353 --> 00:48:28.166
You think you could recreate it?

621
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:29.190
Yeah.

622
00:50:17.908 --> 00:50:18.908
Oh fuck.

623
00:53:03.792 --> 00:53:07.119
What happened?

624
00:53:07.143 --> 00:53:08.460
Charlie, what happened?

625
00:53:08.484 --> 00:53:09.763
What happened to you?

626
00:53:12.426 --> 00:53:14.838
You, you don't want to know.

627
00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.030
Upstairs.

628
00:53:18.054 --> 00:53:19.240
Upstairs what?

629
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.426
There's footsteps coming from upstairs.

630
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:24.636
Wendy, we gotta go check on Wendy.

631
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.660
Go, go.

632
00:53:26.676 --> 00:53:27.689
Uncle Donald.

633
00:53:27.713 --> 00:53:30.403
That thing you said to me earlier,

634
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.400
the pale blue dot.

635
00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.390
Thank you.

636
00:53:34.414 --> 00:53:36.206
Gonna be okay, Charlie.

637
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:37.230
Come on.

638
00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:46.806
Stop.

639
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.320
I think there's something in there.

640
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.265
Shit.

641
00:54:02.289 --> 00:54:03.667
It's right there.

642
00:54:03.691 --> 00:54:04.509
It's okay.

643
00:54:04.533 --> 00:54:05.533
It's okay.

644
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.666
I don't hear it.

645
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:09.690
I can't see it.

646
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.786
Jamie, can you describe it?

647
00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:13.810
What do you see?

648
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:16.439
I don't know.

649
00:54:16.463 --> 00:54:17.463
Just try.

650
00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:22.313
Thin long man in robes.

651
00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:25.060
What else?

652
00:54:27.596 --> 00:54:29.816
They're tattered robes.

653
00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.217
Um just tall, very tall.

654
00:54:32.241 --> 00:54:33.863
Like almost like a shadow.

655
00:54:35.478 --> 00:54:36.478
Nothing.

656
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:09.409
Donald.

657
00:55:09.433 --> 00:55:10.956
Donald!

658
00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:11.980
Come on.

659
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.441
Charlie, open the door.

660
00:55:15.465 --> 00:55:16.367
- Donald.
- Charlie.

661
00:55:16.391 --> 00:55:17.659
Donald!

662
00:55:17.683 --> 00:55:18.493
All right.

663
00:55:18.517 --> 00:55:20.083
- I'll find a way out.
- Jamie.

664
00:55:20.107 --> 00:55:21.160
Jamie.

665
00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:21.993
Jamie, come here.

666
00:55:22.017 --> 00:55:22.826
Look, I can't hear the sounds

667
00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:23.660
and I can't see it.

668
00:55:23.684 --> 00:55:25.276
You gotta tell me where it is, all right?

669
00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.643
Please, just breathe through it.

670
00:55:26.667 --> 00:55:28.062
Breathe through.

671
00:55:28.086 --> 00:55:29.416
What do you see?

672
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.603
What do you see?

673
00:55:52.162 --> 00:55:53.162
Oh my god.

674
00:55:55.296 --> 00:55:56.192
Charlie!

675
00:55:56.216 --> 00:55:57.216
Jamie.

676
00:56:03.048 --> 00:56:03.858
Jamie!

677
00:56:03.882 --> 00:56:05.381
Jamie, I'm coming.

678
00:56:08.671 --> 00:56:10.092
No, no, no.

679
00:56:10.116 --> 00:56:11.433
I can't get it.

680
00:56:11.457 --> 00:56:12.430
Go get Jamie.

681
00:56:12.454 --> 00:56:13.263
Okay.

682
00:56:13.287 --> 00:56:14.097
Just don't let her...

683
00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:15.443
I'm going to go get something.

684
00:56:15.467 --> 00:56:17.550
Okay, I got it, I got it.

685
00:56:27.507 --> 00:56:29.760
Door, the door, come on.

686
00:56:29.784 --> 00:56:31.701
How do I open the door?

687
00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.460
Charlie!

688
00:57:58.862 --> 00:57:59.862
Aunt Wendy?

689
00:59:25.408 --> 00:59:26.408
Charlie.

690
00:59:27.362 --> 00:59:29.186
Oh, oh Jesus.

691
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.020
Come on.

692
00:59:30.044 --> 00:59:31.116
My fucking shoulder hurts.

693
00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:32.223
Okay, okay.

694
00:59:33.953 --> 00:59:35.436
You get Jamie, get Jamie.

695
00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:37.176
- I'll get Nancy.
- Help.

696
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:38.200
- Help me!
- Nancy.

697
00:59:39.303 --> 00:59:40.581
- Nancy.
- Please help me!

698
00:59:40.605 --> 00:59:42.687
Please help me!

699
00:59:46.228 --> 00:59:47.207
Okay, okay, it's okay.

700
00:59:47.231 --> 00:59:48.561
It's okay.

701
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:49.644
It's okay.

702
00:59:49.668 --> 00:59:51.247
It's gonna be okay.

703
00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:54.160
I'm gonna get something
to stop the bleeding.

704
01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:01.663
Jamie.

705
01:00:13.554 --> 01:00:14.554
Jamie?

706
01:00:22.395 --> 01:00:23.395
Jamie.

707
01:00:27.893 --> 01:00:30.232
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

708
01:00:30.256 --> 01:00:31.923
We're gonna be okay.

709
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.866
The book says the candle will burn red

710
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:48.176
if Wendy's soul is taken.

711
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.486
Do we know what the demon is yet?

712
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:50.586
I know what it sounds like.

713
01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:51.796
What?

714
01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.566
I hear a low
pitched hum when it's near.

715
01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:54.744
- I know that.
- Okay.

716
01:00:54.768 --> 01:00:55.577
- All right.
- But I don't

717
01:00:55.601 --> 01:00:56.410
hear it every time.

718
01:00:56.434 --> 01:00:57.244
What do you mean?

719
01:00:57.268 --> 01:00:58.436
I mean, it was right next

720
01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.966
to us upstairs and I didn't hear a thing.

721
01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.276
So it doesn't hum all the time?

722
01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.110
Right.

723
01:01:02.134 --> 01:01:03.626
Uh, a voice, a voice.

724
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:04.676
Maybe you don't hear it all the time

725
01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.286
because sometimes it's a voice?

726
01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:07.760
What about what Jamie saw?

727
01:01:07.784 --> 01:01:11.156
She said it was a
tall, thin man in robes.

728
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.160
There's something like that here.

729
01:01:12.184 --> 01:01:15.556
Tall, tattered robes.

730
01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.926
Low religious chant.

731
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:19.523
The name of the demon...

732
01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:22.225
Jamie!

733
01:01:22.249 --> 01:01:23.249
Jamie.

734
01:01:24.344 --> 01:01:25.373
Jamie!

735
01:01:31.957 --> 01:01:32.851
We can't leave him.

736
01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.366
We need to worry about getting ourselves

737
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.790
out of here right now, okay?

738
01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:55.110
Donald?

739
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:03.190
Donald?

740
01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:06.740
Screw this.

741
01:04:10.778 --> 01:04:12.195
Hey, I gotcha ya.

742
01:04:13.122 --> 01:04:14.476
Hey, hey, hey.

743
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:15.309
It's okay, it's okay.

744
01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:16.143
We gotta keep pressure on it.

745
01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.260
We gotta keep pressure on it.

746
01:04:17.284 --> 01:04:18.380
It's fine, it's fine, it's okay.

747
01:04:18.404 --> 01:04:19.214
Charlie, this...

748
01:04:19.238 --> 01:04:20.216
You're gonna be fine.

749
01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.476
You have to use the book to banish it.

750
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.950
What are you talking about?

751
01:04:24.297 --> 01:04:25.576
Its name, I know its name.

752
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.236
What, it doesn't matter.

753
01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:28.258
It doesn't matter.

754
01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:30.681
The name is Sullumeg.

755
01:04:30.705 --> 01:04:31.705
What?

756
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:34.640
No, no, no.

757
01:04:34.664 --> 01:04:36.283
We need to keep pressure on it, stop.

758
01:04:37.643 --> 01:04:38.958
What are you doing?

759
01:04:38.982 --> 01:04:39.881
Listen to me.

760
01:04:39.905 --> 01:04:41.673
Listen to me.

761
01:04:41.697 --> 01:04:43.696
You're gonna need all my blood to do it.

762
01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.645
It won't work without it.

763
01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:47.810
Charlie.

764
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.266
Hey, remember.

765
01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:53.123
Hey, hey.

766
01:04:54.022 --> 01:04:55.022
Look at me.

767
01:04:57.156 --> 01:04:59.006
You remember about the pale blue dot?

768
01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.937
It's all, it's all just a vast darkness

769
01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:08.723
and this is just one little speck.

770
01:05:12.539 --> 01:05:13.539
Donald?

771
01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:16.245
Donald?

772
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.597
Uncle Donald, Donald, Donald.

773
01:05:18.621 --> 01:05:19.621
Look at me.

774
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:21.390
Please wake up.

775
01:05:29.405 --> 01:05:31.099
It's okay, Jamie.

776
01:05:31.123 --> 01:05:32.824
It's okay, it's okay.

777
01:05:45.094 --> 01:05:46.146
I hear it.

778
01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:47.296
Downstairs, we have to go now.

779
01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.163
- What?
- He gave me his name.

780
01:05:49.187 --> 01:05:50.376
What do we do?

781
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.400
We do it again.

782
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.450
This time with you.

783
01:06:05.007 --> 01:06:05.817
Hurry!

784
01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:07.140
Come on.

785
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:14.630
I can read it.

786
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:16.310
I can read it.

787
01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.976
It's there.

788
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.708
Charlie, watch out.

789
01:06:31.475 --> 01:06:32.511
Charlie.

790
01:06:32.535 --> 01:06:34.011
Charlie.

791
01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:41.870
Don't do it yet, Nancy.

792
01:06:41.894 --> 01:06:43.368
Wait until it gets closer.

793
01:06:43.392 --> 01:06:44.413
What, what about Charlie?

794
01:06:44.437 --> 01:06:46.214
We have and wait until it gets closer.

795
01:06:46.238 --> 01:06:47.214
We have to do it.

796
01:06:47.238 --> 01:06:48.736
Nancy, just wait.

797
01:07:02.047 --> 01:07:03.880
Now, Nancy, do it now.

798
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:42.790
Her fevers gone.

799
01:07:49.254 --> 01:07:50.814
You're probably better off down here.

800
01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.630
This whole fucking house
gives me the creeps.

801
01:07:58.530 --> 01:07:59.730
I hope she'll be okay.

802
01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:02.650
Me, too.

803
01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:20.100
Yeah?

804
01:08:20.124 --> 01:08:21.147
I'm sorry about Donald.

805
01:08:27.955 --> 01:08:30.106
What should we do with this?

806
01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:31.226
Burn it.

807
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:32.250
Sounds good.

808
01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.866
I thought the effects of the ritual

809
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:44.196
were supposed to wear off.

810
01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.076
I don't know.

811
01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.100
Why?

812
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.121
'Cause I can still read it.

813
01:08:49.145 --> 01:08:50.145
What?

814
01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:55.831
Gemullus.

815
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:58.340
We had it wrong.

816
01:08:58.364 --> 01:08:59.991
It's Gemullus.

817
01:09:00.015 --> 01:09:01.033
What do you mean?

818
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:04.546
The book, it gave us the word

819
01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:06.326
but it was backwards.

820
01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:07.626
What?

821
01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:09.226
It gave us Gemullus,

822
01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:11.453
which means twin in Latin.

823
01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:17.985
Um, it says some demons
come in identical pairs

824
01:09:18.009 --> 01:09:20.416
and they are impossible to tell apart

825
01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.543
based on looks on alone
and harder to banish.

826
01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:28.146
It's saying the only way to distinguish

827
01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:32.256
the two demons is by
the tone of their voice.

828
01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.246
One demon has a low pitched voice,

829
01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.079
the other has...

830
01:09:35.103 --> 01:09:36.103
A pitched one.

831
01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:39.356
Yeah.

832
01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.189
You heard that?

833
01:09:40.213 --> 01:09:41.023
You heard two demons?

834
01:09:41.047 --> 01:09:42.946
I don't know, maybe.

835
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.816
In order to banish two identical demons,

836
01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.856
the same incantation
has to be read forward

837
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.186
and in reverse.

838
01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.726
Or one of the demons will remain,

839
01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:53.550
tethered to the world of the living.

840
01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:57.743
One of them will be in our world forever.

841
01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280
We did it wrong.

842
01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:08.230
Where's Jamie?

843
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:11.810
You look down here.

844
01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:12.994
- I'll look upstairs.
- Jamie!

845
01:10:14.057 --> 01:10:15.057
Jamie!

846
01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.640
Jamie.

847
01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:45.123
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

848
01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:57.016
Jamie.

849
01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.040
Jamie!

850
01:10:59.523 --> 01:11:00.793
What the fuck did you do?

851
01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:07.098
What the fuck did you do?

852
01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.745
Jamie?
