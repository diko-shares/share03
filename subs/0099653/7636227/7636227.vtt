15
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.900
this is great.

16
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.900
地方真好!

17
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.500
There's got to be 7 or 8 feet up there.

18
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.500
上面起码有七、八英尺高…

19
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.200
And 80 years of dust.

20
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.200
和八十年的灰尘

21
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.900
Look at all this height.

22
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.900
这样的高度…

23
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.200
With our bedroom upstairs we'd have all this space.

24
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.200
楼上做睡房  下面便有空间

25
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.100
For what?  Just space.

26
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.100
要空间做什么?  就这样空着

27
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.440
1 ...

28
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.060
2...

29
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.310
3!

30
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.300
And 4?

31
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.300
接下来4?

32
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.500
And 5?

33
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.500
然后5

34
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
Watch it. Watch it.

35
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
小心!

36
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.800
God   this place is huge.

37
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.800
这儿真大

38
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200
It's beautiful.

39
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200
真美

40
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.400
You guys it's absolutely incredible.  Incredible.

41
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.400
直难以置信  的确

42
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.330
A little paint you could

43
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.330
稍加粉饰可以

44
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.100
sell this tomorrow and double your money.

45
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.100
双倍价钱出售

46
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.200
Carl   you're obsessed.  A little bit.

47
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.200
你财迷心窍了  有点呢

48
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.100
Whoa   look!

49
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.100
看!

50
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.400
Hey   it's an Indian head penny.

51
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.400
这是古老钱币!

52
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.500
1 898.

53
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.500
1898年

54
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.500
It's a good omen.

55
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.500
这是吉祥之兆

56
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.200
You're the good omen.

57
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.200
你就是吉祥之兆

58
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.300
it's so great.

59
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.300
这太好了!

60
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.000
I had Rose move your 3:00 to 4:00.

61
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.000
我叫了露丝把会议推迟至四时

62
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.300
Gary Allen called late yesterday.

63
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.300
亚伦昨天来电话

64
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.400
He has to see you about the final painting bids for the loft.

65
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.400
他想承接粉饰工程

66
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.600
3:00 is the only time he can make it.

67
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.600
只可以在三时跟你谈谈

68
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.300
Sam?

69
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.300
森!

70
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.800
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.800
对不起

72
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.000
Relax. This isn't brain surgery you're going into.

73
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.000
别紧张  又不是做脑部手术

74
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.600
Pitching these Japanese guys makes me so nervous.

75
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.600
我很紧张  要跟日本人谈生意

76
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.000
Sam...you're going to be great   OK?

77
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.000
你应付得来的

78
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.000
What am I supposed to say?

79
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.000
我可以说什么?

80
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.700
I can't tell them my Swedish pompom girl joke   you know.

81
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.700
又不可以跟他们说黄色笑话

82
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.200
Those are great. Where'd you get those?

83
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.200
这很好  在哪儿买的?

84
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.000
Nice   huh? Molly.

85
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.000
慕莉送的

86
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.400
What do you think? Are they me?

87
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.400
适合我吗?

88
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.400
Man   look at that. A Testarossa.

89
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.400
那部车真了不起

90
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.900
Whoa.Pay off your Mustang first.

91
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.900
别妄想  你的车还未供完

92
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.400
How are you feeling?What did the doctor say?

93
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.400
你怎样?医生怎样说?

94
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.200
He said it was contagious  that it was really...

95
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.200
他说是传染病  别吓我

96
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.300
He said I shouldn't be coming in today.

97
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.300
他说我今天不该上班

98
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.600
What about the rash?   The rash?

99
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.600
那皮肤疹怎样?     皮肤疹?

100
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.100
Mmhmm.The rash is also incredibly contagious.

101
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.100
也会传染别人

102
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.400
He said they've both been spreading.  No.

103
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.400
他说两种病都在扩散  不!

104
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.200
On your genitals again?

105
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.200
又在下体出现?

106
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.900
Yeah.Yeah   right on the genitals.

107
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.900
对  在下体

108
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.800
Basically everywhere.He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.

109
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.800
全身都是  他叫我别碰其他人

110
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

111
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400
对不起

112
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.600

173
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800
你吓死我了

174
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.500
Why'd you do that?

175
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.500
为什么这样做?

176
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.750
It's better than seeing this gorgeous body

177
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.750
总比看见你

178
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.000
splattered all over the place.

179
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.000
粉身碎骨好

180
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.700
Look out.

181
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.700
小心

182
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.700
Sam? Molly? You guys home?

183
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.700
森、慕莉  你们在吗?

184
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.800
Did you invite Carl?

185
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.800
你叫他来的吗?

186
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.900
Slave labor.

187
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.900
他来当苦工

188
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.000
Carl? What?

189
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.000
卡尔!      什么?

190
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.800
Hurry. Help.my God.

191
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.800
赶快帮手!      天啊!

192
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.600
Grab the bottom.

193
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.600
抓住底部

194
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.100
Want this down here?

195
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.100
放在哪儿?

196
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.400
Right here?

197
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.400
放在这儿?

198
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.600
Watch your toes.

199
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.600
小心你的脚趾

200
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.100
Where do you want this?Uh   in the bedroom.

201
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.100
想放在哪里?      睡房

202
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.100
God   this place looks great.

203
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.100
这地方很好!

204
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.600
Yeah.You like it   huh?

205
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.600
你也喜欢?

206
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.500
Like is hardly the word.

207
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.500
何止喜欢

208
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.100
I didn't know it would be this beautiful.

209
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.100
我没想到会这样好

210
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.500
Molly   what about her?

211
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.500
怎样处置它?

212
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.200
Leave her there until we get the rest in.

213
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.200
暂时把它放在那儿

214
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.700
What are these?

215
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.700
这是什么?

216
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.700
let me show you.

217
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.700
我给你看

218
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.400
Help me lift this up.Here?

219
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.400
帮我拿起它      这儿吗?

220
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.800
Wow.What do you think?

221
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.800
我刚完成  怎样?

222
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.200
It's fantastic. I love it.

223
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.200
很了不起

224
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.900
Sam   what's this chair doing here?

225
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.900
要这椅子来干嘛?

226
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.800
What do you mean? I love that chair.

227
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.800
什么意思?我很喜欢椅子

228
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.000
I know   but we discussed this...

229
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.000
我知道  但我们说好了…

230
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.100
I've had it forever.

231
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.100
这椅子一直陪着我

232
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.400
When I watch TV   I sit in it.

233
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.400
我要坐在上面看电视

234
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.100
This chair is ugly.

235
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.100
这椅子很难看

236
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.500
So?And it doesn't go with anything.

237
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.500
跟其他东西不合衬

238
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.600
It goes with me.

239
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.600
它跟我合衬

240
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.900
You're right. It does.

241
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.900
你说得对

242
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.400
We'll paint it.We'll what?

243
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.400
要涂上颜色      什么?

244
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.800
Are you OK?Mmhmm. I'm fine.

245
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.800
你没事吧?      没事

246
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.800
What's the matter?Nothing.

247
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.800
有什么事吗?      没有

248
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.600
You worried about the promotion?No   not really.

249
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.600
担心升职的事吗?      不

250
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.000
Then what?Is it moving in together?No.

251
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.000
为同居的事烦脑?      不

252
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.000
I don't know. It's...a lot of things.

253
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.000
我不晓得  很复杂

254
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.900
I just don't want the bubble to burst.

255
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.900
怕好梦成泡影

256
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.700
Seems like   uh...

257
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.700
这就像…

258
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.350
whenever anything good in my life happens

259
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.350
我每次遇上好的事

260
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.600
I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it.

261
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.600
都怕会失去

262
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.700
I love you.

263
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.700
我爱你

264
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.800
I really love you.

265
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.800
真的爱你

266
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.300
Ditto.

267
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.300
我也是

268
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.600
The pilot first reported trouble

269
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.600
机尾的二号引擎发生爆炸

270
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.000
when the number two engine blew

271
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.000
机上载满了乘客

272
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.800
Jesus   another one?

273
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.800
又一宗飞机失事

274
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.500
don't watch that.

275
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.500
别看了

276
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.100
I should cancel my L. A. trip.These things always happen in threes.

277
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.100
我该取消行程  祸事总接二连三

278
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.500
Sam   get serious.Besides   you lead a charmed life.

279
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.500
你太认真了  你一向吉星高照

280
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.600
yeah? So did they.

281
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.600
他们也是

282
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.700
It's amazing.

283
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.700
真可怕

284
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.100
Just like that.Blackout.

285
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.100
眼前一黑  什么都完了

286
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:05.460
My love

287
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.920
My darling

288
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.340
I've hungered for...

289
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.800
What are you doing?

290
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.800
你在干嘛?

291
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.500
I couldn't sleep.

292
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.500
我睡不着

293
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.800
I must have passed out.

294
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.800
我定是睡着了

295
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.600
What time is it?It's 2 a.m.

296
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.600
现在什么时候?      凌晨两点

297
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.370
Goes by

298
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.790
So slowly

299
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.790
Any time

300
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.790
Can do so much

301
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.750
Are you

302
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.050
Still mine

303
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.500
no.I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.

304
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.500
希望这不是你的杰作

305
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.400
It's not now.

306
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.400
现在不是了

307
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.300
Can I help?  Yeah.

308
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.300
我可以帮你吗?      可以

309
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.800
Put your hands here and get them wet.

310
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.800
把手放在这儿

311
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.400
Just let the clay slide between your fingers.

312
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.400
让粘土在指间流过

313
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.530
God speed your love

314
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:19.950
To me

315
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.540
Lonely rivers Flow

316
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.460
To the sea

317
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.720
To the sea

318
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.840
To the open arms

319
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.100
Of the sea

320
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.060
Yeah

321
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.230
Lonely rivers sigh

322
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.890
Wait for me

323
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.270
Wait for me

324
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.400
I'll be coming home

325
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.610
Wait for me

326
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.110
Oh

327
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.870
My love

328
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.500
My darling

329
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.630
I've hungered

330
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.920
Hungered for your touch

331
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.970
A long

332
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.800
Lonely time

333
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.390
And time

334
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.940
Goes by

335
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.780
So slowly

336
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.820
Any time

337
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.410
Can do so much

338
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.290
Are you

339
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:51.540
Still mine

340
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.510
I need

341
00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.140
Your love

342
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.350
I

343
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:07.180
I need your love

344
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.150
God speed your love

345
00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:17.610
To me

346
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.000
no.

347
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.000
我不知道

348
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.000
What's the matter?

349
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.000
什么事?

350
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.300
A glitch. What's up?

351
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.300
小问题  有什么事?

352
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.500
The Greenberg and White accounts I can't get in.

353
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.500
我入不到一些户口

354
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.000
The Mac code isn't working.

355
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.000
密码无效

356
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.200
I changed it.Why?

357
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.200
我改了      为什么?

358
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.400
Nothing. I want to nose around a bit.

359
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.400
只是想查查这些户口

360
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.100
Is something wrong?

361
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.100
有何不妥?

362
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.900
Can you keep a secret?

363
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.900
你可以保守秘密吗?

364
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.400
Yeah   sure.What's up?

365
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.400
当然  什么事?

366
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.000
There's too much money in these accounts.

367
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.000
这些户口有太多存款

368
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.100
Too much money? That's impossible.

369
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.100
过多?这不可能的

370
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200
Sam

371
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200
森

372
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.300
this is going to take you hours.Let me do this.

373
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.300
这会花你很多时间  让我做吧

374
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.000
It's already taken me hours.

375
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.000
我已花了很多时间

376
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.300
Let me figure it out.

377
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.300
让我替你完成它

378
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.900
No   that's OK.It's like a vendetta now.

379
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.900
不  现在这就像我的世仇一样

380
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.300
Thanks   though. I appreciate it.

381
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.300
谢谢你

382
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.000
OK.If you start to go blind   give a shout.

383
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.000
倦了的话就大声叫我

384
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.800
OK. Adios.

385
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.800
好  再见

386
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.400
Listen   what are you and Moll doing tonight?

387
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.400
你和慕莉今晚有什么节目?

388
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.400
We're going to the theater to see Macbeth.

389
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.400
我们去看莎士比亚的戏剧

390
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.500
She likes the guys in tights.

391
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.500
她喜欢男人穿贴身裤

392
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.900
You want to go?

393
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.900
你想去吗?

394
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.700
No   thanks.I want a full report   though.

395
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.700
不  但你之后要向我汇报

396
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.300
Later.Yeah.

397
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.300
再见      再见

398
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.500
Well   I loved it.I was spellbound the whole time.

399
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.500
他们的演出很精彩

400
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.800
I could tell.So could everyone else with that resonating snore of yours.

401
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.800
是  但你整晚在打鼾

402
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.100
Did I tell you what Melissa said?

403
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.100
我有跟你提过美施的话吗?

404
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.200
Yeah   about six times.

405
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.200
提了六次左右

406
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.800
It wasn't six times.

407
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.800
才没有

408
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.000
Quit being so blase about this.

409
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.000
别这么冷淡

410
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.600
This is really important.

411
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.600
这很重大

412
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.600
I'll have two pieces in her gallery.

413
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.600
我有两件作品在画廊展览

414
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.000
The New York Times reviews her gallery all the time.

415
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.000
时代周刊经常报导那画廊

416
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.800
Molly   The New York Times is just some frustrated little critic

417
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.800
时代周刊的人只是失意的评论家

418
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.800
with pimples on his ass who flunked art school.

419
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.800
一些被美术学校退学的人

420
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.200
Who cares what they think?

421
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.200
谁在乎他们想什么?

422
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.500
About eight million readers   that's who.

423
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.500
杂志有八百万读者

424
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.200
Nah   they're just reading the sports page.

425
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.200
他们只看体育版

426
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.700
Your work is really beautiful.It really is.

427
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.700
你的作品很漂亮

428
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.800
Thanks.It shouldn't matter

429
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.800
谢谢 我觉得

430
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.800
what anyone else thinks just what I think.

431
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.800
其他人怎么想并不重要

432
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.600
I want to marry you   Sam.  What?

433
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.600
森  我想跟你结婚      什么?

434
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.800
What?  Yep.

435
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.800
什么?  没错

436
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.700
I've been thinking about it.

437
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.700
我一直在想

438
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.400
I've been thinking about it a lot

439
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.400
想了很多

440
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.600
and I think we should just do it.

441
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.600
我们该结婚

442
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.800
You're serious.  Yeah.

443
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.800
你认真的吗?      是的

444
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.400
What's that look for?

445
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.400
为什么这个样子?

446
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.000
You never wanted to talk about it.

447
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.000
你从来不想提的

448
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.500
Do you love me   Sam?

449
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.500
你爱我吗?

450
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.900
Well   what do you think?

451
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.900
你认为呢?

452
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.000
Why don't you ever say it?

453
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.000
为什么不说出来?

454
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.100
What do you mean? I say it all the time.

455
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.100
我常说的

456
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.700
No   you say ""ditto  ""and that's not the same.

457
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.700
不  你只说 我也是  这不一样

458
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.700
People say I love you all the time  and it doesn't mean anything.

459
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.700
常把我爱你挂在嘴边并不意味着什么

460
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.000
You know   sometimes you need to hear it.

461
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.000
人有时需要听一听

462
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.500
I need to hear it.

463
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.500
我需要听你说

464
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.100
Let's go.

465
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.100
走吧

466
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.400
What should we do?   Let me handle it.

467
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.400
该怎么办?      我来应付

468
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.000
What do you want?

469
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.000
你想怎样?

470
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.300
Your wallet give it to me!

471
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.300
给我钱包

472
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.800
Sam   just give it to him.

473
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.800
给他吧

474
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.000
OK   just take the money. Just leave

475
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.000
把钱拿去好了

476
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.200
No   Sam

477
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.200
森

478
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.300
You son of a bitch!

479
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.300
混蛋!

480
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.200
Sam   don't!

481
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.200
森  不!

482
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.500
Somebody help us!

483
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.500
救命!

484
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.300
Somebody!Somebody help us!

485
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.300
救命!

486
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.900
Sam   just let...

487
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.900
森  算吧

488
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.300
Sam   stop it.Stop it   Sam!

489
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.300
森  停手吧

490
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.100
Molly?

491
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.100
慕莉

492
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.900
Molly   he got

493
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.900
慕莉  你要…

494
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.120
Sam...

495
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.120
森

496
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.700
Baby   hold on.You're going to be OK.

497
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.700
支撑下去  没事的

498
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.900
Somebody?Somebody?

499
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.900
来人!

500
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.200
Somebody help us!

501
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.200
救命!

502
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.600
my God.Sam. come on.Hold on   baby.

503
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.600
天啊  坚持住  森 坚持住

504
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.400
Someone's going to come.

505
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.400
快有人来的了

506
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.800
You're going to be OK.

507
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.800
会没事的

508
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.300
Somebody!Somebody help me!

509
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.300

Help me. Please help me.

513
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.500
救我

514
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.500
Take it easy   all right?

515
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.500
别紧张  你没事吧?

516
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.300
We'll help you   OK?

517
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.300
我们来帮你

518
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.700
Molly? Molly?

519
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.700
慕莉…

520
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.890
All right. All right.

521
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.890
没事的

522
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.730
What should we do?

523
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.730
我们该怎么办

524
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.100
What's happening?

525
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.100
发生什么事了?

526
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.610
What's...

527
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.610
怎么

528
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.400
Is he breathing?

529
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.400
他仍有呼吸吗?

530
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.870
I don't know if he's breathing.

531
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.870
我不知道

532
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.200
Don't die   Sam. Hold on.

533
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.200
森  支撑下去

534
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.690
Come on   man.

535
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.690
撑住

536
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.150
All right.

537
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.150
好了

538
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.480
Here we go.

539
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.480
该走了

540
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.280
1 ...

541
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.240
Come on   baby.

542
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.240
挺住

543
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.200
Sam   don't you leave me.Sam   hold on!

544
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.200
森  别离开我  坚持住

545
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.700
Sam...

546
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.700
森…

547
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.710
Jesus...

548
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.710
上帝保佑

549
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.500
Miss Jensen   if you'll just step this way   please.

550
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.500
请到这边来

551
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.800
So   what happened to you?   What?

552
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.800
你遇上什么事?      什么?

553
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.200
You're new   huh? I could tell.

554
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.200
你新来的?我看得出

555
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.600
Are you talking to me?

556
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.600
你跟我讲话?

557
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.000
Relax. It ain't like before.It's a whole new ball of wax.

558
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.000
放松点  你从此跟以前不同了

559
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.000
Who are you?

560
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.000
你是谁?

561
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.500
I'm waiting for my wife.She's in the cardiac wing. She's fighting it.

562
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.500
我在等我老婆  她还在垂死挣扎

563
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.100
Shot   huh?

564
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.100
中枪?

565
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.000
That'll do it every time.

566
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.000
总难免一死

567
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400
Poor bastard.

568
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400
可怜人

569
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.200
You may as well get used to it.

570
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.200
你要适应

571
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.300
You could be here for a long while.

572
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.300
你可能要在此一段时间

573
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.700
Come here. I'll tell you a secret.

574
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.700
告诉你一个秘密

575
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.500
Doors ain't so bad.

576
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.500
门挡不到你

577
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.800
Zip   zap they ain't nothing.You'll see. You'll catch on.

578
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.800
形同虚设  你会学到的

579
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.800
He ain't going to make it.

580
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.800
他不行了

581
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.400
I've seen it a million times.He's a goner.

582
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.400
我见过无数次  他没救了

583
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.100
You see?Here they come.

584
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.100
看见吗?天堂之光来了

585
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:37.000
Lucky bastard.It could have been the other ones.You never know.

586
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:37.000
他幸运  地狱使者没有来勾魂

587
00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.600
Who are

588
00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.600
谁是…

589
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200
No!

590
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200
不

591
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.000
God help me.

592
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.000
救我

593
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200
God...help me.

594
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200
救我

595
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.700
""I am sunk in the abysmal swamp where there is no foothold.

596
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.700
我踏进无底的深渊…

597
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.900
I have reached the watery depths.The flood overwhelms me.

598
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.900
泥足深陷  洪水把我淹没

599
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.600
I am wearied with calling.''

600
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.600
我惶恐大叫

601
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.600
As we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat

602
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.600
我们告别好友韦森…

603
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:53.100
we are reminded of his kindness...his generosity his buoyancy of spirit.

604
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:53.100
想起他生前慈祥慷慨、为人活跃

605
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.900
All that we treasure

606
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.900
我们所珍惜的…

607
00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:03.860
our loved ones  our friends  our body  our mind

608
00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:03.860
爱人、朋友、躯体、思想

609
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.490
are but on loan to us.We must surrender them all.

610
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.490
全是暂借回来  终要交还

611
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.500
We are all travelers on the same road

612
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.500
我们不过是同路的过客

613
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.700
which leads to the same end.

614
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.700
走向同一个尽头

615
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.500
As our loved one enters eternal life

616
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.500
我们所爱的人已得到永生

617
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.800
let us remember that love   too   is eternal.

618
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.800
同样我们的爱也是永恒

619
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.700
That although we will miss him

620
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.700
虽然我们会怀念他

621
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.220
our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.

622
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.220
但爱会驱除黑暗

623
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.480
I picked up your shirts today.I don't know why.

624
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.480
我今天去洗衣店拿你的衫

625
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.500
Mr. Reynolds told me to tell you hello.

626
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.500
老板问候你

627
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.400
I broke into tears.

628
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.400
我忍不住流泪

629
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.800
It's like I think about you every minute.

630
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.800
我老是想着你

631
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.100
It's like I can still feel you.

632
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.100
感觉你仍在身旁

633
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.200
I'm here   Moll.

634
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.200
慕莉  我在这儿

635
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.700
Floyd   what's the matter   kitty?

636
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.700
猫咪  怎么了?

637
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.800
Crazy cat.

638
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.800
怪猫!

639
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.300
Sam?

640
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.300
森?

641
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.900
That's really stupid.

642
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.900
我真傻

643
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.400
I love this picture.

644
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.400
我喜欢这张照片

645
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.180
It's great.Office.

646
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.180
这很好…办公室的

647
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.500
Let me see that.

648
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.500
让我看看

649
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.150
It's   um...Sam's address book.   Right.

650
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.150
森的通讯录      对

651
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.500
Dave Brubeck. Newport   '88.Should I toss them?

652
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.500
88年的音乐会门票  要撕掉吗?

653
00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:03.290
No.No? Molly   we hated that concert.

654
00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:03.290
别  慕莉 我们讨厌那音乐会

655
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.900
You wanted to save those?

656
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.900
你要留下那些?

657
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.400
Rolaids?Molly   what are you doing?

658
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.400
胃药?留着干嘛?  慕莉  你在干嘛?

659
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.600
I just miss him   Carl.

660
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.600
我很想他

661
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.000
Me   too.

662
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.000
我也是

663
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.600
Carl?  Yeah?

664
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.600
卡尔      什么?

665
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.190
Wait a minute. Wait.

666
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.190
等等

667
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.690
What?Not that one.

668
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.690
别拿走那个

669
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.700
Which? I'm sorry.I didn't mean to put that on there.That's OK.

670
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.700
哪个?我无意拿走它  别介意

671
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.740
Hey   Moll   why don't you come?

672
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.740
你何不跟我出去?

673
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.900
It's like summer outside.

674
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.900
外面像夏天

675
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.400
No   I'm really not up for it.

676
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.400
我没有心情

677
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.500
Just for a walk.

678
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.500
来吧  你该出外走走

679
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.800
I don't want to.

680
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.800
我不想去

681
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.100
You can't stay in all day.

682
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.100
你不能整天躲在屋里

683
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.200
It's not healthy.

684
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.200
这很不健康

685
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.300
Carl   I can't do it!

686
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.300
我做不到

687
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.600
Molly   you're not the one who died.

688
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.600
死的人又不是你

689
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.390
I'm sorry.  Don't apologize.

690
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.390
对不起      不用道歉

691
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.600
Shit.

692
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.600
该死

693
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.950
Maybe you're right.Maybe just a short one.That a girl.

694
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.950
你说的对 应该出去走会儿      这才对

695
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.300
I'm sorry.Don't worry about it.

696
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.300
对不起      别介意

697
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.300
Molly!

698
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.300
慕莉?

699
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.300
What are you doing here?

700
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.300
你来干什么?

701
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.900
You bastard.

702
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.900
你这混蛋!

703
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.100
You son of a bitch!

704
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.100
混蛋!

705
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.400
What do you want?

706
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.400
你想怎样?

707
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.500
Molly?Molly   get out!

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.700
Molly!Molly   he's got a gun!

714
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.700
他有枪

715
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.400
Hi   kitty. Hi.

716
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.400
小猫咪

I understand you wish to contact your husband.

768
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.700

But you know   Mrs. Santiago

772
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:45.250
但是你要知道桑缇雅歌太太

773
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.790
there's no telling about that other world

774
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.790
信则有  不信则无

775
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.500
so you've got to be a believer   Mrs. Santiago.Are you a believer?

776
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.500

779
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.900
Then let us begin.

780
00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.900
那么现在开始

781
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.400
I can't.I can't. It's too difficult.

782
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.400
我做不到  太困难了

783
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.800
I can't make contact. I don't feel his vi

784
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.800
看来不能跟他接触

785
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.000
No   wait!

786
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.000
我感觉不到他的…且慢!

787
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.100
I'm feeling something.Did he know someone by the name of Anna?

788
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.100
他认识叫安娜的人吗?

789
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.800
Consuelo?

790
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.800
康苏鲁?

791
00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.000

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:49.800
玛利亚?      他妈妈叫玛利亚

797
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.800
Yes! Praise God   I knew he was with his mama.

798
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.800
谢天谢地  他跟妈一起

799
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.600
my God.

800
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.600
天啊!

801
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.400
It's too difficult. It's two of them.

802
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.400
太困难了  他俩在一起

803
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.000
I'm not sure I can do that.It's so trying.

804
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.000
我不确定我能否做到  太难了

805
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.800
I pay more. How much?

806
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.800
我可以多付些钱

807
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.900
How much?   $20.

808
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.900
要多少?      二十块

809
00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.100
Way to go. Milk her for every penny.

810
00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.100
把她的钱都骗光吧

811
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:34.440
Huh. Yes   I...I believe we can start again.

812
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:34.440
我们从头再来吧

813
00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.500
Thank you   Jesus.  Thank you   Jesus.

814
00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.500
感谢主

815
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.700
Welcome   Mrs. Santiago.You're fortunate today.

816
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.700
你今天真好运

817
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.200
The spirits are churning.

818
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.200
亡魂来了

819
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.600
My husband?

820
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.600
我丈夫?

821
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.200
Have mercy!

822
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.200
很幸运

823
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.600
yeah? Where?

824
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.600
是吗?在哪儿?

825
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.500
Julio?    Yes!

826
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.500
朱里奥?   是的

827
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.200
I feel his vibration.

828
00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.200
我感觉他的振动

829
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
I see him!

830
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
我看到他

831
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.900
How is he? How does he look?

832
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.900
他是怎样子?

833
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.300
he's a handsome man.  Handsome?

834
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.300
很英俊      英俊?

835
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.600
Mrs. Santiago   in Our Father's kingdom  we're all handsome.

836
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.600
在天国的人都很英俊

837
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.000
Julio.

838
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.000
朱里奥!

839
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.600
Julio's coming towards us.I see him! He's coming!

840
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.600
朱里奥正走过来

841
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800
He's there!

842
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800
就在那儿

843
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.500
He's dressed in a black suit.

844
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.500
他穿着黑色衣服

845
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.400
Black suit?

846
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.400
黑色衣服?

847
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.200
It could be blue.

848
00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.200
可能是蓝色的

849
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.500
What a crock of shit.

850
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.500
真是装神弄鬼!

851
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.100
Who is that?

852
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.100
谁?

853
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.300
Julio? Julio?

854
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.300
朱里奥?

855
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.400
Julio! Where are you?

856
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.400
你在哪儿?

857
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.200
Did you hear it?

858
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.200
你听到吗?

859
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.400
Damn! Where are you?

860
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.400
你在哪儿?

861
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400
Julio?

862
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.400
朱里奥

863
00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.800
Who are you?Whoa!

864
00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.800
你是谁?

865
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.300
You can hear me?

866
00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.300
你听到我的话吗?

867
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.600
Don't you hear him?

868
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.600
你没听到他说话?

869
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.800
I don't believe this.Hey   you   my name's Sam Wheat.

870
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.800
真难以置信  我叫韦森

871
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.000
Can you hear me? Sam Wheat. Say my name.

872
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.000
你听到吗?把我的名字说出来

873
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Leave me alone!

874
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
别缠着我

875
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.400
Say it! Sam Wheat!

876
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.400
叫我的名字  韦森

877
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.200
Talk to me   Oda Mae. Say something!

878
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.200
奥德美  说些话吧

879
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.500
Sam Wheat!

880
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.500
韦森

881
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.800
Jesus.

882
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.800
天啊!

883
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.700
Sam Wheat?  Sam Wheat?

884
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.700
韦森?

885
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.100
I swear   no more cheating.

886
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.100
我发誓不再骗人

887
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.100
I'll do anything. I'll do penance but make that guy go away!

888
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.100
我答应会赎罪  叫他走吧

889
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.200
No way.

890
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.200
妄想

891
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.700
It's OK.

892
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.700
没事的…

893
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.400
Yeah   you're all right.

894
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.400
你没事的

895
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.900
My mother and my mother's mother both had the gift.

896
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.900
我妈和外婆都会通灵

897
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.400
They always said I had it   but I never did.I never had it.

898
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.400
但我一直不会

899
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.800
They told me all about it.

900
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.800
她们教晓我通灵之道

901
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.200
But now that I got it   I don't think I want it.

902
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.200
现在我能了  但我不想通灵

903
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.000
Go away. Find somebody else.

904
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.000
你另找他人吧

905
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.700
Somebody else? You're out of your mind.

906
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.700
另找他人?你疯的吗?

907
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.100
I'm getting there fast.

908
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.100
我快疯了

909
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.200
She hit her head harder than we think.

910
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.200
她的头撞得很伤

911
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.200
She was talking to nobody before she hit her head.

912
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.200
她撞头前已这样自言自语

913
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.200
Sister can do that.

914
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.200
我知道  但姐姐可以这样做

915
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.800
Where exactly are you?

916
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.800
你到底在哪儿?

917
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.400

你以为她会听我的话吗?

945
00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.800
It's just a phone call.

Remember the starfish in Montego Bay?

你还记得蒙特哥湾的海星吗?

1041
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.600
How would I know that if he wasn't here?

1042
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.600
他不跟我说  我怎晓得?

1043
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.600

这个我永不会忘记

1049

你在雷诺城跟他拍过照

1051
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:30.810
Ask her about the sweater she knitted in the closet that's too big.

1052
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:30.810
告诉她衣橱里那件她织的毛衣太大了

1053
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.700

你听到我的话吗?

1061
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.200
I hear you.   Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

1062
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.200
我听到了      我不是跟你说

I don't know you or Sam

1084
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.100
我不认识你  也不认识森

1085
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.400
but let me tell you what he did.

1086
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.400
他却害得我好苦

1087
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.300
He kept me up all night singing I'm Henry The Eighth   I Am.

1088
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.300
整晚在唱我是亨利八世

1089
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.700
That's how he got me to go out with him.

1090
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:34.700
他也是这样叫我出去

1091
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.100
Look   I'm sorry.I just I just don't believe

1092
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.100
对不起  我…

1093
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.400
in this life after death stuff.

1094
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.400
我不相信鬼魂之说

1095
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.400
Well   tell her she's wrong.

1096
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.400
说她错了

1097
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.500
He says you're wrong.

1098
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.500
他说你错了

1099
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.400
You're talking to him right now?

1100
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.400
你现在跟他说话?      是的

1101
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.700
He just asked me to tell you that you're wrong.

1102
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.700
他要我说  你错了

1103
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.700
So where is he?

1104
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.700
他在哪儿?

1105
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.400
I can't see him. I can only hear him.

1106
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.400
我看不到他  只听到他的声音

1107
00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.200
I'm right here.

1108
00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.200
我在这儿

1109
00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.400
That doesn't help   Sam.

1110
00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.400
森  没用的

1111
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.800
I'm holding her hand.

1112
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.800
我握着她的手

1113
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.200
He says he's holding your hand.

1114
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.200
他说正握着你的手

1115
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.500
What are you doing?What do you think you're doing to me?

1116
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.500
你到底在做什么?你想对我做什么?

1117
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.900
If you think I'm here for my health   you're crazy.

1118
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.900
若你以为我来寻开心  你就错了

1119
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.300
Sam's dead   OK? He's dead.

1120
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.300
森死了

1121
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.600
Tell her I love her.

1122
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.600
告诉她  我爱她

1123
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.900
He says he loves you.

1124
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.900
他说他爱你

1125
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.200
Sam would never say that.

1126
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.200
森从来不会这样说

1127
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.200
Say ditto.

1128
00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.200
跟她说  我也是

1129
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.300
What the hell is ditto?Ditto!

1130
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.300
什么?我也是!

1131
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.800
To tell you the truth  I don't know how I'm doing this.

1132
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.800
老实说  我不知自己怎么做得到

1133
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:19.000
Confidentially   nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

1134
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:19.000
这种事从没在我身上发生

1135
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.400
I mean   nothing.Now I can't turn it off.

1136
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.400
现在却欲罢不能

1137
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.800
Is this him? Is this you?

1138
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.800
这是他?这是你?

1139
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.800
Yeah.  Yeah.

1140
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.800
是的

1141
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.100
Huh. Cute.White   but cute.

1142
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.100
虽然你是白人  但很帅

1143
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.900
What I don't understand is  why did he come back?

1144
00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.900
我不明白他为何回来

1145
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.400
I don't know.

1146
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.400
我不知道

1147
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.700
Why is he still here?

1148
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.700
为什么还在?

1149
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.800
He's stuck   that's what it is.He's in between worlds.

1150
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:40.800
他是进退两难  夹在阴阳之间

1151
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.500
You know   it happens sometimes

1152
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.500
这种事常发生

1153
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.150
that the spirit gets yanked out so quick

1154
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.150
人突然死去

1155
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:47.800
that the essence still feels it has work to do.

1156
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:47.800
总觉有心愿未了

1157
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.600
Would you stop rambling?

1158
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.600
别乱说

1159
00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.100
I'm just answering her question.

1160
00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.100
我只是回答她的问题

1161
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.300
He's got an attitude now.

1162
00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.300
他在发脾气

1163
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.200
I don't have an attitude.Yes   you do have an attitude.

1164
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.200
我没有      你有

1165
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.800
We're having a little discussion.

1166
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.800
我们正在讨论

1167
00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.700
If you didn't have a attitude

1168
00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.700
你没发脾气的话

1169
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.600
you wouldn't have raised your voice.

1170
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.600
就不会提高声量

1171
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.800
God damn it   Oda Mae

1172
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.800
该死  我没提高…      别咒骂我

1173
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.700
Don't you god damn me.Don't you take the Lord's name in vain.

1174
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.700
别随便咒骂我  我可受不了

1175
00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.200
Would you relax?You relax.You're the dead guy.

1176
00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.200
放松点      你放松点  你已死了

1177
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.700
Want me to help? You apologize.

1178
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.700
你要我帮你  就得道歉

1179
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.500
Jesus Christ!I'm leaving.

1180
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.500
天啊!    我走了

1181
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.800
Nobody talks to me like that   you understand?

1182
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.800
我走了  没人会这样跟我说话

1183
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.100
Now   you better apologize.

1184
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.100
你最好道歉

1185
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.300
I'm sorry.I apologize.OK?

1186
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.300
对不起  我道歉  好了吧?

1187
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.400
Now   would you sit down?Please?

1188
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.400
请你坐下

1189
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.100
He's apologized.

1190
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:28.100
他在道歉

1191
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.900
I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying

1192
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.900
请把我的话

1193
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.300
but you have to tell her word for word.

1194
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.300
原原本本告诉慕莉

1195
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.900
word for word.Yes.

1196
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.900
原原本本      好

1197
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.400
He wants me to tell you what he's saying word for word.

1198
00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.400
他要我原原本本转述他的话

1199
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.900
Molly   you're in danger.

1200
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.900
慕莉  你有危险

1201
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.800
You can't just blurt it out like that.

1202
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.800
你说话不可以这样直接

1203
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.200
And quit moving around   will you?You're making me dizzy.

1204
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.200
别再走来走去  弄得我头都晕了

1205
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.100
I'll just tell her in my own way.

1206
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.100
我会用我的方式说

1207
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.200
Molly   you in danger   girl.

1208
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.200
慕莉  你身陷险境

1209
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.900
What are you talking about?

1210
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.900
你在说什么?

1211
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.800
I know the man who killed me.

1212
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.800
我知道谁杀死我

1213
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.100
He knows who killed him.

1214
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.100
他知道谁杀死自己

1215
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.900
His name's Willy Lopez. I know where he lives.

把它写下来      他想你写下来

1221
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.700
You write it down.I ain't no damn secretary.

1222
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.700
你写下来      我又不是秘书

1223
00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.100
Just do it!

1224
00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.100
照做吧

1225
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.500
He's so testy.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.500
他很暴躁

1227
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.000

他有我的钱包门匙  还进过我家

1237
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.800

他有他的钱包门匙  还进过他家

1239
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.900
Yesterday after your walk with Carl

1240
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.900
你昨天跟卡尔散步回来

1241
00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.900
you talked to Floyd   took off your clothes

1242
00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.900
跟猫咪玩  跟着更衣…

1243
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.000
All right   all right.

1244
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.000
好了…

1245
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.100
When you came in after your walk with Carl

1246
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.100
你昨天跟卡尔散步回来

1247
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.900
he saw everything.

1248
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.900
你更衣时  尽给他看见了

1249
00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.400
Go to the police. It was a setup.

1250
00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.400
你得报警  那是个阴谋

1251
00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.400

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.000
He says go to the police. He was murdered.

1254
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.000
他要你报警  说自己被谋杀

1255
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.100
There's somebody else involved

1256
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.100
此事还有同谋

1257
00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.200

1261
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.600

祝你生活愉快  祝你死后愉快

1271
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.400
Molly   there is no one on earth besides you

1272
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.400
慕莉  在这世界上除了你

1273
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.400
who wants this to be true more than me

1274
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.400
没有人比我更希望这是真的

1275
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.900
but you got to be rational about this.

1276
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.900
但你得理性一点

1277
00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.700
Sam is no more in this room than

1278
00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.700
森不再存在了

1279
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:35.900
Look   I understand the need to hang on to him I really do

1280
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:35.900
我知道你挂念他  我也是一样

1281
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.200
but this is absurd.

1282
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.200
但这很荒谬

1283
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.100
I know this seems absurd   but it had to be real.

1284
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.100
看似荒谬  却是事实

1285
00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:44.050
You believed some fortuneteller from Brooklyn

1286
00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:44.050
你怎可以相信那些

1287
00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:46.000
who shows up at your door?

1288
00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:46.000
在你窗外大喊大叫的神棍

1289
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.900
I watched her have a conversation with him.

1290
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.900
我亲眼看见她跟森交谈

1291
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.000
I don't buy it   Moll   not for a minute.

1292
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:52.000
我一点都不相信

1293
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.400
What about the things she knew?

1294
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.400
她知道的事情怎样解释?

1295
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.600
What things?

1296
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.600
什么事?

1297
00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.700
The photo Sam took of me on our trip to Reno.

1298
00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.700
她知道我们在雷诺城拍照

1299
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.000
Carl   we were alone.

1300
00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.000
当时没有其他人在旁

1301
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.800
And the green underwear that I wrote my name in.

1302
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.800
还知道我的内衣写上了名字

1303
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.600
She said Sam knew who killed him.

1304
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:10.600
她说森知道谁是凶手

1305
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.600
Yeah   that he was set up.

1306
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.600
他被谋杀

1307
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.800
This is getting deranged.We're off the deep end.

1308
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.800
这简直离谱  别再谈这个

1309
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.900
She had a name and an address

1310
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.900
她有他的名字和住址

1311
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.600
Willy Lopez.

1312
00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.600
他叫威里卢兹

1313
00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.900
303 Prospect Place   apartment 4D.

1314
00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.900
住在光景台303号4D室

1315
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.700
This is sick.

1316
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.700
一派胡言

1317
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.900
Carl.

1318
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.900
拜托!卡尔

1319
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.400
This is really sick.

1320
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:29.400
真是一派胡言

1321
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.730
God.

1322
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:30.730
天啊!

1323
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:39.400
Molly   I don't understand how you could you could...

1324
00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:39.400
想不到你竟信以为真

1325
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.000
swallow this crap. I mean...this guy may not even exist.

1326
00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.000
可能根本没这个人

1327
00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.500
Maybe she's just trying to use you to set someone up.

1328
00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.500
她可能利用你来陷害人

1329
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.500
You're right.

1330
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.500
你说得对

1331
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.600
You're absolutely right.

1332
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.600
说得很对

1333
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.700
That's what I got to find out.

1334
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.700
我要找个水落石出

1335
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.500
What do you mean   find out?

1336
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.500
你打算怎么办?

1337
00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.900
She said Sam wants me to go to the police.

1338
00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.900
森想我报警

1339
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.600
Sam wants you to go to the police?

1340
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.600
森想你报警?

1341
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.650
Jesus   Moll. Are you out of your mind?

1342
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.650
慕莉  你疯了吗?

1343
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:07.800
What are you going to tell the police?

1344
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:07.800
你打算怎么跟警察说

1345
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:12.500
That some storefront psychic has been communing with the dead?

1346
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:12.500
告诉他们有人能通灵吗?

1347
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.300
Do you know what that sounds like?

1348
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.300
你知道这听来有多荒谬?

1349
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.100
You're talking ghosts here   for Christ's sake.

1350
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.100
你在说这世上有鬼

1351
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.300
I'm sorry.This stuff just really gets to me

1352
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.300
对不起  这事令我失态

1353
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.200
you know?It's OK if you don't believe me.

1354
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.200
你不相信也不要紧

1355
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.500
I'm trying to   Molly.

1356
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.500
我设法相信

1357
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.900
if it'll make you feel any better I'll go check this out   OK?

1358
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.900
为了令你安心  我会调查一下

1359
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.100
I want you to try and get some sleep.

1360
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:44.100
好好睡觉吧

1361
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.180
All right.

1362
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.180
好的

1363
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.300
I'll call you in the morning.OK.

1364
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.300
我明早给你电话      好

1365
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.400
Good night

1366
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:50.400
晚安

1367
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.300
Be careful.

1368
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.300
小心

1369
00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:33.310
Carl.

1370
00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:33.310
卡尔

1371
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.800
What the hell are you doing here?

1372
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.800
你来干什么?

1373
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.900
Who you been talking to   Willy?

1374
00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:40.900
你跟谁说过?

1375
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.800
""Talking to""? What the hell do you mean?

1376
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.800
那是什么意思?

1377
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.800
Some woman knows all about you   everything.

1378
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.800
有个女人知道你的一切

1379
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.900
Where's she getting it from?

1380
00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.900
她从何得知?

1381
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.700
I haven't said a word to anybody.

1382
00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.700
我没跟人说过

1383
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.100
She knows your name and where you live.

1384
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.100
她知道你的姓名、地址

1385
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.200
A lot of women know where I live.

1386
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.200
很多女人都知道我住在哪儿

1387
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.800
This is not a joke.

1388
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.800
这不是玩笑

1389
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.500
She knows about the murder.

1390
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.500
她知道你杀人

1391
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.100
I want you to find this bitch whoever she is

1392
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.100
你要把这个女人找出来

1393
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:08.300
and I want you toJust get rid of her   OK?

1394
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:08.300
把她灭口

1395
00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:13.300
I've got $4 million stuck in a god damn computer.

1396
00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:13.300
我有四百万元卡在电脑中

1397
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.100
If I don't get those codes if that money is not transferred soon...

1398
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.100
若我找不到密码  不能把钱调走

1399
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:26.200
I'm...dead.We're both dead.

1400
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:26.200
就会没命  我俩都没命

1401
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.300
Why not tell them you only launder money

1402
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.300
告诉他们你要月初才能洗黑钱

1403
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.200
the first of the month?

1404
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.200
你有什么问题?

1405
00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.400
What the hell is wrong with you?Is everything a joke?

1406
00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.400
说笑吗?

1407
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.200
You killed a man.You were supposed to steal his wallet.

1408
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.200
我叫你去偷钱包  你却杀死了他

1409
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.300
Was that a joke? I did you a favor.That was a freebie.

1410
00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.300
我免费帮了你

1411
00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.300
Look   these are drug dealers   OK?

1412
00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.300
他们是大毒贩

1413
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.700
Just don't blow this for me.I've risked my job. I could go to jail.

1414
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.700
你别破坏一切 累我失业 坐牢

1415
00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.900
$80  000 of that money is mine.

1416
00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:53.900
当中有八万元是我的

1417
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.720
Look   just...let me have the key to Sam's apartment.

1418
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.720
把森的门匙给我

1419
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.740
I'll get the address book myself   OK?

1420
00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.740
我去找通讯录

1421
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.100
You god damn bastard!

1422
00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:32.100
你这混蛋!

1423
00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.500
Why?Why? You were my friend!

1424
00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.500
为什么?你是我朋友

1425
00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.800
I had a life god damn you.I had a life!

1426
00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.800
我本该有我未完的人生

1427
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.300
Look   I don't even believe in this stuff myself.

1428
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.300
我本来也不相信

1429
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.700
But she was real.

1430
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.700
但她很真

1431
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.200
You think I'd come down here if it wasn't real?

1432
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.200
若不是真的  我干嘛到这儿来?

1433
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.600
You know you told me if I had any new information

1434
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.600
你叫我有新消息就找你

1435
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.100
that I should come.So here I am.

1436
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.100
所以我来了

1437
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.400
I know how this sounds.

1438
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.400
我知道很荒谬

1439
01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.200
I hear myself saying it  and I want to cringe.

1440
01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.200
也想打消这想法

1441
01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.000
But this woman knew things she couldn't have known.

1442
01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.000
但这女人知道她不可能知道的事

1443
01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.800
Things Sam only said to me.

1444
01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.800
森只对我说的话

1445
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.400
OK   according to this psychic lady

1446
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.400
根据这灵媒的话

1447
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.700
there are ghosts and spirits all over the place

1448
01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.700
到处都有鬼魂

1449
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.700
watching us all the time?Huh?

1450
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.700
一直监视我们

1451
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.700
Hell   I'm never going to get undressed again.

1452
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.700
那我不再脱衣服了

1453
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.100
Excuse me.I got more important things to do.

1454
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.100
对不起  我有更重要的事

1455
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.000
The guy's name is Willy Lopez.

1456
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.000
那人叫威里卢兹

1457
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.100
All I'm asking you to do is check it out.

1458
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.100
我只求你调查他

1459
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:07.300
OK. Wait here.Let me see if the guy's got a record   all right?

1460
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:07.300
你等等  我看他有无犯罪记录

1461
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200
Great.

1462
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200
好

1463
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.300
What are you doing?

1464
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.300
你在干什么?

1465
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.800
Where's the file on Willy Lopez?   There isn't one.

1466
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.800
卢兹的档案呢?      没有他的

1467
01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.250
He was probably some old boyfriend

1468
01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.250
可能是她

1469
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:20.700
she was trying to get even with.

1470
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:20.700
诬害旧男友

1471
01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:25.300
This psychic woman's got a record that goes back a long way.

1472
01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:25.300

没可能的

1483
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.400
It goes on and on

1484
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.400
数之不尽

1485
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.000
She knew things   private things.

1486
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.000
她知道很多私隐

1487
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.600
Now how could she have known all that?

1488
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.600
她怎么会知道?

1489
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.800
A lot of times they read the obits.

1490
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.800
她们会留意讣闻

1491
01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.900
She just had to see the word ""banker""boom.

1492
01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.900
她只需要看报纸

1493
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.600
Hell they even go through your...garbage

1494
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.600
甚至搜你的垃圾

1495
01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600
to find things they can use

1496
01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600
找有用的资料

1497
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.100
letters   old papers.It doesn't take much.

1498
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.100
像信和用过的纸张  这不是真的

1499
01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:10.200
No.It was real.

1500
01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:10.200
不  这是真的

1501
01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.800
She knew about a...a sweater I knitted.

1502
01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.800
她知道我编织的毛衣

1503
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:27.600
And songs we sang.Our trip to Montego Bay.

1504

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.100
我知道这很难过

1507
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.300
People want so much to believe.

1508
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.300
他们哀伤 脆弱

1509
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.600
They're grieving they're vulnerable...

1510
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.600
什么也想相信

1511
01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.800
and they will give anything for one last moment.

1512
01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.800
愿意付出一切

1513
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.300
Believe me.These people know what they're doing.

1514
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.300
相信我  这些人是有企图的

1515
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.000
I know how you must feel but you know you can press charges.

1516
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.000
我知你很难过  但你可以控告她

1517
01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400
No.

1518
01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400
不

1519
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.400
Thank you.

1520
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.400
谢谢

1521
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.000
God   let this be it.

1522
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.000
天啊!成全我吧!

1523
01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:33.900
Yes.

1524
01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:33.900

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.100
Let me know what you want me to do.

1532
01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.100
你想我做什么?

1533
01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.550

办妥之后通知我们

1547
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:16.900
OK. I've got it.

1548
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:16.900
知道了

1549
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.100
Just tell Mr. Balistrari that there won't be any more problems OK?

1550
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.100

做得好

1555
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.900
Molly   why can't you hear me?I need you.

1556
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.900
我需要你  为何你听不到我说话

1557
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.600
Who is it?  It's Carl   Molly.

1558
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.600
谁?      卡尔

1559
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.100
No.Don't open it   Molly.He's a murderer.

1560
01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.100
别开门  他是个凶手

1561
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:52.100
Hi.I know it's late.I'm sorry to disturb you.

1562
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:52.100
抱歉这么晚还来打扰你

1563
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.400
I've been thinking about you all day

1564
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.400
只是我整天想着你

1565
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.400
and I feel really lousy about what happened last night.

1566
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.400
我觉得自己昨晚很讨厌

1567
01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.700
This supernatural thing just

1568
01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.700
那些鬼神之说  使我…

1569
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:04.000
Don't worry about it. It's OK.No   it's not.

1570
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:04.000
别介意      不

1571
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.100
You needed me to hear you   and I didn't.

1572
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.100
你想我听你说  我却没有

1573
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.400
I wasn't there for you   and that was...that was wrong.

1574
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.400
我没有支持你  很不对

1575
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.000
It's just   I...

1576
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.000
我只是…

1577
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.200
I justI want you to know that I'm your friend.

1578
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.200
希望你知道我是你的朋友

1579
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.300
Thanks   Carl.

1580
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.300
谢谢

1581
01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.800
You were never our friend.

1582
01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.800
你从不是我们的朋友

1583
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.000
That really means a lot to me.Me   too.

1584
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.000
这对我很重要      我也是

1585
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.600
I brought you some Japanese apple pears.I know you like them.

1586
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.600
我带了水果来

1587
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500
Thanks.That's very sweet.

1588
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500
谢谢  你真好

1589
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.200
Could I come in for a second?

1590
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.200
可以进来一会吗?

1591
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.200
It's just been one of those days.

1592
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.200
我不会久留  像从前一样

1593
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.900
Maybe some coffee?

1594
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.900
喝杯咖啡

1595
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.300
Yeah. Come on in.

1596
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.300
进来吧

1597
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.300
No   Molly.

1598
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.300
不!

1599
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.300
You seem a little tense.Are you OK?

1600
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:46.300
你神态紧张  没事吧?

1601
01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:50.300
No. I'm fine.It's just What can I tell you?

1602
01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:50.300
没事  这些日子很难熬

1603
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.400
It's been tough.It just still hurts so much.

1604
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.400
这事所造成的打击真不少

1605
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.000
You lying snake.

1606
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.000
撒谎鬼!

1607
01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.500
And on top of it   it's stuff at work.

1608
01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.500
工作上又遇上不少问题

1609
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.500
They've given me my own accounts

1610
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.500
他们让我自己负责帐户

1611
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.100
which is good  but I just haven't really had time to adjust

1612
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.100
我没有时间适应

1613
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.400
kind of absorb everything.

1614
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.400
消化一切

1615
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.000
It's no big deal.

1616
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.000
没什么大不了

1617
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.500
Yeah.Can I have just a little more cream?

1618
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.500
可以多给我忌廉吗?

1619
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.000
shit.Jesus. I can't believe I did that.

1620
01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.000
天啊!我真是不小心

1621
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.500
Are you all right?Yeah   I'm fine.

1622
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.500
你没事吧?      没事

1623
01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.350
Let me throw that in the washer.

1624
01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.350
我拿去洗

1625
01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:43.000
Don't worry about it. It's OK. It's just...

1626
01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:43.000
别为这个粗心

1627
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.700
You want another shirt?  No. It'll dry. It'll just take a minute.

1628
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.700
换衣服吗?      不  很快会干

1629
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.250
Where were you today?I thought you were going to

1630
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.250
还以为你今天

1631
01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.600
come into the bank and sign those papers?

1632
01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:58.600
会到银行来签文件

1633
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.700
I was supposed to   but I didn't have time.

1634
01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.700
我没有时间

1635
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.600
I went to the police.

1636
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.600
我去了警局

1637
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.500
You did?Wow. What did you tell them?

1638
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.500
真的?你跟他们说了什么?

1639
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.100
What did they say?It was awful.

1640
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.100
他们怎么看  很糟

1641
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.500
I felt really stupid.

1642
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.500
我觉得自己很笨

1643
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.100
They brought out a file on this woman and

1644
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.100
他们让我看那女人的档案

1645
01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.200
At least 10 inches thick.

1646
01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.200
起码厚达十英寸

1647
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.800
A rip off artist   huh?

1648
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.800
她是个骗徒?

1649
01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400
No   Molly.

1650
01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.400
不  慕莉

1651
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:37.300
You know   the sad thing...is that I believed her.

1652
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:37.300
最难过的是我相信她

1653
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.200
Molly...

1654
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.200
慕莉

1655
01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.900
sometimes we need to believe.

1656
01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.900
有时难免会相信

1657
01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.000
Why? What's the point?

1658
01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.000
为什么?

1659
01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.700
Molly   it's not easy to face the realities of life sometimes.

1660
01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.700
面对现实不容易

1661
01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.100
You got to give yourself that.

1662
01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.100
你得放纵自己

1663
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.400
What you've got to remember is the love that you guys felt.

1664
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.400
记住你俩之间的爱

1665
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.100
You got to remember how good Sam was.

1666
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.100
记住森有多好  有多爱你

1667
01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.700
You were everything to him Molly.You were his life.

1668
01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.700
你就是他的一切  他的生命

1669
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.400
I feel so alone.

1670
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.400
我觉得很孤单

1671
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.100
You're not alone.OK?

1672
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.100
你并不孤单

1673
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.500
You got your work. You're incredibly talented.You're young.

1674
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.500
你有工作 有天赋  而且还年轻

1675
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.400
You're fantastically gorgeous.

1676
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.400
你很了不起

1677
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.600
I don't know what's real anymore.

1678
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.600
我再也分不出真假

1679
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.400
I don't know what to think.

1680
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.400
不知道该想什么

1681
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.000
Just think about Sam.

1682
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.000
想想森吧

1683
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.400
Think about the time you guys had together.

1684
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.400
想想跟他一起的时候

1685
01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:58.400
How wonderful that was.

1686
01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:58.400
怎样美妙

1687
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.700
Yeah.Let your feelings out   Moll. It's OK.

1688
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.700
你哭出来吧

1689
01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:10.000
Life turns on a dime.You know?

1690
01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:10.000
生命会突然转变

1691
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.500
I mean...people think that...

1692
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.500
人们总以为

1693
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.000
they're there forever that there's always going to be tomorrow

1694
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.000
自己有明天

1695
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.400
but that's bull shit.Sam taught us that.

1696
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.400
那是废话  森的死已告诉我们

1697
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.000
You have to live for now.

1698
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.000
我们活着是为了现在

1699
01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.900
For today.

1700
01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:29.900
为了今天

1701
01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.000
I can't.I'm sorry.  It's OK.

1702
01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.000
不可以  对不起      不要紧

1703
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.700
III can't. It's just too soon.It's OK.

1704
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.700
不可以  太快了      不要紧

1705
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.800
You've been great   Carl.

1706
01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.800
你一直都很好

1707
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.800
But I need you to leave.I understand totally.

1708
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.800
但我觉得你该离开了     我完全明白

1709
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.200
Please.

1710
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.200
求求你

1711
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.300
Could we just have dinner tomorrow night? Just talk?

1712
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.300
明晚一起吃饭吧  只是聊聊天

1713
01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.100
Can I interest you in that?

1714
01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.100
赏面吗?

1715
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.900
Yeah.Sure.  Great.

1716
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.900
好      太好了

1717
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.800
Get off my train!  No.

1718
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.800
离开我的列车!      不

1719
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.600
Get off!

1720
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.600
给我滚!

1721
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.200
Get off!Get off!

1722
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.200
滚!

1723
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.900
Get off!Get out of here!

1724
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.900
快滚!离开这儿

1725
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.000
No.Show me how you do that.I'm not leaving till you teach me.

1726
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.000
教我你的本领  否则我不会离开

1727
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.600
Get off!  No.

1728
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.600
滚!      不

1729
01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.600
Get off!

1730
01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.600
快滚!

1731
01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.400
You stubborn asshole.

1732
01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.400
顽固的傢伙!

1733
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.600
What are you doing?What the hell are you doing?

1734
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.600
你在做什么?

1735
01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.600
What am I doing?

1736
01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.600
什么意思?

1737
01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.700
You're trying to move it with your finger.

1738
01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.700
你竟想用手指移动它

1739
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.100
You can't push it. You're dead.

1740
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.100
你已经死了  不能再用手指推它

1741
01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.300
It's all in your mind.

1742
01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.300
你要用意志

1743
01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.100
The problem with you is you still think you're real.

1744
01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.100
不能以为自己还是实体

1745
01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.000
You think you're wearing those clothes?

1746
01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.000
你以为自己还有穿衣服

1747
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.900
You think you're crouched on that floor?

1748
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.900
蹲着在地上?

1749
01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.800
Bull shit!

1750
01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.800
笨蛋!

1751
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.400
You ain't got a body no more   son!

1752
01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.400
你已没有躯体  现在得靠这儿

1753
01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.000
It's all up here!You want to move something

1754
01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.000
想推动事物

1755
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.600
you got to move it with your mind!

1756
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.600
就要靠意志

1757
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.800
You got to focus!do you understand?

1758
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.800
你要集中意志  听到吗?

1759
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.000
How? How do you focus?

1760
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.000
如何集中?

1761
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
I don't know how you focus.You just focus.

1762
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
只要集中就好了

1763
01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.400
How did you do that?

1764
01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.400
你怎么做得到?

1765
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400
You got to take all your emotions all your anger

1766
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400
你只需要把愤怒

1767
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400
all your love all your hate

1768
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400
爱恨

1769
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.000
and push it way down into the pit of your stomach

1770
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.000
迫到内心深处

1771
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.400
and let it explode like a reactor. Pow!

1772
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.400
让它像核反应堆般爆发出来

1773
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.800
OK.OK.

1774
01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.800
好

1775
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800
Don't laugh.

1776
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.800
别笑

1777
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.100
Way to go   kid.

1778
01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.100
就是这样

1779
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.300
I did it.I did it.

1780
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.300
我做到了

1781
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.500
Way to go.

1782
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.500
就是这样

1783
01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.700
From your gut   like I told you.

1784
01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.700
由体内激发出来

1785
01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.800
Give it time. What else have you got?

1786
01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.800
慢慢来  你时间多的是

1787
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.000
How long have you been here?

1788
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.000
你在这儿多久了?

1789
01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.200
Since they pushed me.

1790
01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:22.200
我被推落铁轨之后

1791
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.600
Someone pushed you?Yeah   someone pushed me.

1792
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.600
有人推你?      是的

1793
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.800
Who?   You don't believe me?

1794
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.800
谁?    你不相信吗?

1795
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.500
You think I fell? You think I jumped?fuck you!

1796
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.500
你以为我失足或自己跳下去吗?

1797
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.900
It wasn't my time!I wasn't supposed to go!

1798
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.900
我不该这么早就死去

1799
01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.600
I'm not supposed to be here!

1800
01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.600
不该在这儿

1801
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.400
I'd give anything for a drag.

1802
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.400
我很想抽一口

1803
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.800
Just one drag.

1804
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.800
只是一口

1805
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.400
Are you all right?

1806
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.400
你没事吧?

1807
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.700
Who are you? Why are you hounding me?

1808
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.700
你是谁?为什么缠着我?

1809
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.600
Who sent you?

1810
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.600
谁派你来的?

1811
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.300
Who sent you?

1812
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.300
谁派你来的?

1813
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.200
Leave me alone.

1814
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.200
别缠着我

1815
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.200
Leave me alone!Leave me alone!

1816
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.200
别缠着我

1817
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.750
Yes!You need to concentrate 'cause if you concentrate

1818
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.750
你集中意志

1819
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.500
you'll probably rouse him.

1820
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.500
就可以叫他出来

1821
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.900
What's his name again?Orlando.

1822
01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.900
他叫什么名字?      奥兰度

1823
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.900
Orlando. Orlando. Is there an Orlando here?

1824
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.900
这里有叫奥兰度的吗?

1825
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.500
I'm here.

1826
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.500
在此!      他在这儿

1827
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.300
He's here.Sam.

1828
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.300
奥德美      森

1829
01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:30.400
Oda Mae   IExcuse me. I'm Orlando.The line's over there.

1830
01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:30.400
我是奥兰度  你该排队

1831
01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.900
Where did these ghosts come from?

1832
01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.900
哪里来这么多鬼?

1833
01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.100
You can hear them   too?

1834
01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:34.100
你能听到他们的话吗?

1835
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.800
I hear them in the morning and the evening.

1836
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.800
我早上听得到

1837
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.100
They're coming into the shower.

1838
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.100
晚上也听得到  洗澡时也听得到

1839
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.900
Did you tell every spook you met about me?

1840
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.900
你做过什么?

1841
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.700
I got spooks from Jersey coming in here.

1842
01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.700
新泽西的鬼也来找我

1843
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.900
There's stuff going on you wouldn't believe.

1844
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.900
想不到会发生这种事

1845
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.300
It's amazing. You're really doing it.I know.

1846
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.300
你真的可以通灵      我知道

1847
01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.900
Can you hurry this up?

1848
01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.900
你们快点好吗?

1849
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.900
chill out. Chill out.

1850
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.900
冷静一点

1851
01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.000
I need your help.There's something we need to do.

1852
01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.000
我想你多帮我一个忙

1853
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.400
I'm not doing anything else with you   Sam.

1854
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.400
不  我不会再帮你

1855
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.000
You're holding on to a life that doesn't want you anymore.

1856
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.000
你还眷恋着前生

1857
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.900
It doesn't want you. Give up the ghost.

1858
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.900
但它不想要你  放弃吧

1859
01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.400
Are you speaking to me?

1860
01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.400
你跟我说吗?

1861
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.700
Does it look like it?

1862
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.700
我像跟你说吗?

1863
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.500
You're supposed to be concentrating   aren't you?

1864
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.500
我跟你说时  你自会知道

1865
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.100
You going to try it?

1866
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.100
你该集中意志

1867
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.600
Thank you very much.

1868
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.600
集中你的意志吧  谢谢

1869
01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.000
Sam   are you going to get out of here?

1870
01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.000
森  你出去吧  我还有工作

1871
01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.200
Fine   then stay there.

1872
01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.200
不走是你的事

1873
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.090
Excuse me.Excuse me.You ready now?

1874
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.090
对不起  你准备好了吗?

1875
01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.000
Let's do it.

1876
01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.000
现在开始

1877
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.100
I got to talk to you now.I've got a plan.

1878
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.100
我要现在跟你说  我有个计划

1879
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.600
All we got to do is we can...

1880
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.600
我想到了  我们只要…

1881
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.300
Oda Mae?

1882
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.300
奥德美

1883
01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.600
Oda Mae.

1884
01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.600
奥德美?

1885
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.600
Ortisha?

1886
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.600
奥缇莎?

1887
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.400
Orlando. Is that you?

1888
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:51.400
奥兰度  是你吗?

1889
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.800
Ortisha   where you at? I can't hardly see.

1890
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.800
奥缇莎  你坐在哪?我看不到你

1891
01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.800
Here. ShShe's here.

1892
01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.800
她在这儿

1893
01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.800
In front of you. I'm right here.

1894
01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.800
我就在你面前

1895
01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.000
Damn   baby   what did you do to your hair?

1896
01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.000
你的头发怎么了?

1897
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Orlando   you like it?It's autumn sunrise.

1898
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
喜欢吗?这是秋日晨曦型

1899
01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.400
Get out of me   you son of a bitch.

1900
01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.400
混蛋  你给我滚!

1901
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.900
Don't you ever do that to me again.

1902
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.900
别再这样对我!

1903
01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.100
Orlando?

1904
01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.100
奥兰度

1905
01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.300
I can barely move.

1906
01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.300
我不能动

1907
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.100
You should know better than that.

1908
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.100
你应该知道

1909
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.200
Jumping into bodies wipes you out.

1910
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.200
上身会耗尽你的气力

1911
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.800
Everybody out.

1912
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.800
全给我滚!

1913
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.600
What happened to Orlando?Where's the insurance policy?

1914
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.600
奥兰度怎么了?保险单放在哪?

1915
01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.400
Are you deaf?I said everybody out!

1916
01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.400
你聋的吗?我叫你们滚!

1917
01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:45.000
Everybody out!Get out! Get out!

1918
01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:45.000
滚出去!

1919
01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.300
Get out.Everybody get out!

1920
01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.300
滚

1921
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.200
You the fortuneteller?

1922
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.200
你就是那个算命婆?

1923
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.200
Who are you?

1924
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.200
你是谁?

1925
01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.000
That's an interesting question.

1926
01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.000
问得好

1927
01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.600
Why don't you tell me?

1928
01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:06.600
由你告诉我吧

1929
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.800
Willy.

1930
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.800
威里

1931
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.800
Willy?

1932
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.800
威里?

1933
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.200
Prospect Place Willy?

1934
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.200
光景台的威里?

1935
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.700
Get out of here fast.

1936
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.700
快离开这儿

1937
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.200
Oda Mae! Sister! Sister!

1938
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.200
奥德美

1939
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.900
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1940
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.900
我没事

1941
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.700
We're in trouble   so you got to help.

1942
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.700
我们有麻烦  你要帮帮我

1943
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.900
What do you mean we? You're already dead.

1944
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.900
你不明白吗?你都已经死了

1945
01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.000
These people are trying to kill me.

1946
01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.000
现在是他们想杀的是我

1947
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.900
And they'll be back.

1948
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.900
你说得对  他们会再来

1949
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:46.200
Why don't you just find a house to haunt?

1950
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:46.200
你找个房子去骚扰吧

1951
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.900
Get some chains and rattle them or something.

1952
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.900
制造些怪声吓人吧

1953
01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.600
I have a plan   and it will work

1954
01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.600
听我说好吗?我有个很好的计划

1955
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.500
but get some of your fake I.D.s.

1956
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.500
你要弄张假身分证

1957
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.800
Forget it.

1958
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.800
妄想

1959
01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.900
If you do this   they'll never bother you again.

1960
01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.900
完成之后再没有人会骚扰你

1961
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.200
Scout's honor.

1962
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.200
答应吧

1963
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.100
All right.What do I have to do?What exactly do I have to do?

1964
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.100
好  到底要我做什么?

1965
01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.700
You got a nice dress?

1966
01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.700
你有好看的衣服吗?

1967
01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.400
I don't see what's wrong with what I'm wearing.

1968
01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.400
我这件衣服有何不妥?

1969
01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.500
Sorry. I made a joke. I love your shoes.

1970
01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.500
说笑罢了  你的鞋不错

1971
01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.000
I don't know anything about banking.

1972
01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.000
我对银行业一窍不通

1973
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.300
Oda Mae   would you just relax?

1974
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.300
不知道这是否可行      放松一点

1975
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.900
Listen   I'm nervous.

1976
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.900
我很紧张

1977
01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:32.100
I'll get you through it.

1978
01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:32.100
我知道  但我会帮你

1979
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.800
Your fake driver's license is great.

1980
01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.800
你的假驾照很好

1981
01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.700
Sam. I don't think I should do this.

1982
01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.700
森  我做不来的

1983
01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:40.200
Straight ahead. A stairway that says new accounts.

佛格生是个蠢蛋

2089

I've known him for five years and he still thinks my name's

2090
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.800
我认识他五年  他还以为我叫…

2091
01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.200
Why are you whispering?

2092
01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.200
你为何要细声说?

2093
01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.800
Just be quiet and listen.

2094
01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:29.800
安静点听我说

2095
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.600
He's a social moron.Just tell the guard Ferguson knows you.

2096
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.600
他很蠢的  你不用担心

2097
01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.900
You spent time with him and his wife Shirley

2098
01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.900
告诉守卫佛格生认识你

2099
01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.100
at the Brewsters' Christmas party last year. Got it?

2100
01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:37.100
你在去年的圣诞派对中

2101
01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.400
What is this in regards to?

2102
01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:39.400
跟他和他太太雪莉一起

2103
01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.900
What? He doesn't remember me?

2104
01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.900
请问有何贵干?

2105
01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.500
we spent all that time

2106
01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:44.500
他忘记我了吗?

2107
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:49.200
at the Brewsters' Christmas party last year.

2108
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:49.200
我和他夫妇一起参加圣诞派对

2109
01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.550
It was beautiful.

2110
01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.550
那里太漂亮了

2111
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:53.900
A big old tree and thousands of presents everywhere.

2112
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:53.900
当时的圣诞树很大  礼物又多

2113
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Gas.

2114
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
胃气

2115
01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.200
I get a little gas from time to time.That's all. Gas.

2116
01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.200
我不时有胃气

2117
01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.400
Quit poking me!

2118
01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.400
别再碰我

2119
01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.300
Well   don't overdo it.

2120
01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.300
别做得过火

2121
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.900
Now   listen. This'll be easy.Ferguson was so drunk

2122
01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.900
他当时醉了

2123
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.600
he could've had a conversation with Tina Turner and not remember.

2124
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.600
凡事记不起

2125
01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.900
I don't know   Sam.

2126
01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.900
会成功吗?

2127
01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800
Here we go.

2128
01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800

2133
01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.300

Tell him you've been wondering

2147
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:54.850
问他证券的

证券吗?

2154
01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.000
Well   it looks like we topped out on that one   huh?

2155
01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:07.000
看来赚了一些钱

2156
01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:09.300

Is that correct?

2190
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.600
对吗?

2191
01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.700

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.900
告诉他要银行本票

2203
01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:15.500
I think better a cashier's check.

2204
01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:15.500
银行本票比较好

2205
01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.100

Mama took the money that she made in the oil wells

2236
01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:00.750
妈要把油井赚来的钱

2237
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:02.420
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

2238
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:02.420
投资加油站

2239
01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.100
You know how they have at the gas station?

2240
01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.100
你知道她们干嘛投资加油站吧

2241
01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:08.100
It's very very lucrative.

2242
01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:08.100
相当赚钱

2243
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.400
Oda Mae...it really adds up.

2244
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.400
奥德美      真的赚很多…

2245
01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.600
We've have to go.Say goodbye.

2246

我可以要这支笔吗?

2251
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.900
Say good night to Bobby and Snooky for me.

2252
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.900
替我问候波比与丝露琪

2253
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.100
Byebye.Why are you rushing me?

2254
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.100
为什么赶着走?

2255
01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.100
What is wrong?

2256
01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.100
有何不妥?

2257
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.800
Excuse me. Lyle?

2258
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.800

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.700
Jensen. The woman you were just doing business with...

2262
01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.700
刚才离开的女人…

2263
01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.400
What did she want?

2264
01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:48.400
来做什么?

2265
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.700
Did it have anything to do with Sam?

2266
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.700
跟我和森有关的吗?

2267
01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:54.100
Sam? Why   no. No.

2268
01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:54.100
森?不

2269
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.200
That was Oda Mae Brown   right?

2270
01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:56.200
她是奥德美吧?

2271
01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.000
No. Her name was Rita Miller.She was closing an account.

2272
01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.000
她叫美拉  来结束帐户的

2273
01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.100
Is there a problem?

2274
01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.100
有问题吗?

2275
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.400
No   I guess not. Thank you.

2276
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.400
没有  谢谢

2277
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.600
Carl   is something wrong?

2278
01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.600
有什么问题?

2279
01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.800
Is somebody playing with the computers?What?

2280
01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.800
有人动过电脑吗?      什么?

2281
01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.300
One of my accounts is closed.

2282
01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.300
我有个帐户被终止了

2283
01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:47.000
Which account? What's wrong?You want me to call someone?

2284
01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:47.000
要通知其他人?

2285
01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.600
No   it's OK.I can do it. I got it.

2286
01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.600
不用了  我会处置

2287
01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:58.700
$4 million!What am I going to do with this money?

2288
01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:58.700
我该如何运用这四百万?

2289
01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:01.300
I'm going to buy the block.

2290
01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:01.300
我要买下大厦…不

2291
01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:02.200
I'm going to make my sister go to a fat farm.

2292
01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:02.200
我要买房子

2293
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.400
I'm going to buy the building.

2294
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.400
还要送我的姐妹去减肥中心

2295
01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.900
I've got an idea.

2296
01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.900
你想做什么?      我要买大厦

2297
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.000
Please donate.

2298
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.000
我有个主意

2299
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.900
Take the check out of your purse.

2300
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.900
什么主意?      把支票拿出来

2301
01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:15.900
Right. I should put it where nobody can get it.

2302
01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:15.900
对  要拿出来把它放好

2303
01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.600
No. No. Endorse it.

2304
01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.600
不  在背后签名

2305
01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:22.300
If I endorse it   then if I drop it

2306
01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:22.300
若丢了  拾到的人就可拿去兑现

2307
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.700
somebody will get it.

2308
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.700
这不是你的钱

2309
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.900
I never said you were going to get the money.

2310
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.900
我没说你可以拿这笔钱

2311
01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.650
It's blood money. I was killed for this money.

2312
01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.650
这笔钱累我丧命

2313
01:32:28.650 --> 01:32:30.400
Now endorse the check.

2314
01:32:28.650 --> 01:32:30.400
签名吧

2315
01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:33.400
What are you going to do with it?

2316
01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:33.400
你打算怎样处置它?

2317
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.000
Look over there.To your left.

2318
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.000
看看你的左边

2319
01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.900
You don't think I'm giving this $4 million

2320
01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.900
我不会把四百万块捐给修女

2321
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.300
If you don't   they'll track you down.

2322
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.300
你不这样做  他们就会找到你

2323
01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.400
to a bunch of nuns.Get rid of it.

2324
01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.400
你得摆脱这笔钱

2325
01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:53.800
Sam   you're killing me!It's $4 million!

2326
01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:53.800
是你要我的命  这是四百万

2327
01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.500
You'll go to heaven.

2328
01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.500
你会因此上天堂

2329
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.400
I don't want to go to heaven.I want to cash the check.

2330
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.400
我宁愿把支票拿去银行兑现

2331
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.900
Hello.

2332
01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.900
你好

2333
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.200
You'll thank me later.

2334
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.200
你之后会多谢我

2335
01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.100
How are you doing?

2336
01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.100
你好吗?

2337
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.700
Now   endorse it ""Rita Miller.""I know.

2338
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.700
签美拉的名字      知道了

2339
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.600
Make it out to St. Joseph's shelter.

2340
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.600
收款人写

2341
01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.200
I can't believe you're making me do this.

2342
01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.200
想不到我会这样做

2343
01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.300
Now give it to her.

2344
01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.300
把支票给她

2345
01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:27.400
I want to feel it one more time.

2346
01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:27.400
我只是想多拿一会儿

2347
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.400
Give the lady the check.I will!

2348
01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:29.400
把支票给她      我会

2349
01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.200
Hand her the check.You can do it.

2350
01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.200
你做得到的

2351
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.300
Give her the check.I will!

2352
01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.300
给她      我会的了

2353
01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.300
Bless you   child. Bless you.

2354
01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.300
愿主保佑你

2355
01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600
Give it to her.

2356
01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600
把支票给她

2357
01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:56.900
Let go. Let go!

2358
01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:56.900
放手

2359
01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.500
Shit.

2360
01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.500
他妈的!

2361
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:05.700
I'm proud of you   Oda Mae.

2362
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:05.700
我以你为荣

2363
01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.800
I don't care. Stay away from me from now on.

2364
01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.800
我不在乎你是不是以我为荣

2365
01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.400
What is that nun going to do with it?

2366
01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.400
别再缠我  修女要这些钱干嘛?

2367
01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.900
Leave me alone. Never talk to me again.

2368
01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.900
又不能买东西  你别再跟我讲话

2369
01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.000
I think you're wonderful   Oda Mae.

2370
01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.000
你很了不起

2371
01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.600
Go ahead   search. You'll never find it.

2372
01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.600
继续找吧  你永远都找不到

2373
01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.300
They're going to kill you   Carl.

2374
01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.300
他们会取你的命

2375
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.900
You and Willy.You're going to be fertilizer.

2376
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.900
把你和威里杀死

2377
01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:06.300
They're going to bury you right next to Jimmy Hoffa.

2378
01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:06.300
把你们葬在大流氓的墓旁

2379
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.500
Who's doing that?Who's doing that?

2380
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.500
谁干的?

2381
01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:14.200
I thought we were having dinner.

2382
01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:14.200
你在哪儿?不是约好吃晚饭吗?

2383
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.000
I know   Moll. I'm sorry.I just forgot.

2384
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.000
对不起  我有点乱  我忘记了

2385
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.400
Had trouble at the bank.

2386
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.400
他在银行有麻烦

2387
01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.800
Forgot? I wish you'd called.I've been really worried.

2388
01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.800
你忘记了?我很担心你呢

2389
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.700
Listen   Molly. I got to ask you about something.

2390
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.700
我有些事情要问你

2391
01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.900
Yeah. He needs to borrow $4 million.

2392
01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.900
他想借四百万

2393
01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:32.250
When you said that you thought

2394
01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:32.250
你觉得

2395
01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:34.600
Sam was here that he was talking to you

2396
01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:34.600
森的鬼魂跟你说话

2397
01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.300
what did he say to you?

2398
01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.300
那种感觉是怎样的?他说什么?

2399
01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:38.400
What does that have to do with anything?

2400
01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:38.400
为什么这样问?

2401
01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.900
Just listen to me.

2402
01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.900
先听我的话

2403
01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:43.700
This psychic lady   I want to know what she told you.

2404
01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:43.700
那灵媒跟你说过什么?

2405
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.000
Stop this.

2406
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:46.000
放开我  停手

2407
01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.300
It doesn't matter. It wasn't real.

2408
01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.300
这不重要  因不是真的

2409
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:54.400
What the hell happened to you tonight?

2410
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:54.400
你今晚怎么了?

2411
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.100
Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today?

2412
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.100
因为她今天到过银行?

2413
01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:06.800
The bank?Yeah. Ferguson said she closed an account.

2414
01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:06.800
银行?      佛格生说她结束帐户

2415
01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.800
Her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.It's Rita Miller or something.

2416
01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.800
她不用奥德美的名字  而用美拉

2417
01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:17.600
Carl   are you all right?

2418
01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:17.600
你没事吧?

2419
01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.400
It's just my stomach. It's...

2420
01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.400
我的胃不舒服

2421
01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:26.500
Jesus.

2422
01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:26.500
天啊!

2423
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.800
Do you have any like some PeptoBismol or something?Cyanide...

2424
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.800
你有胃药吗?      给他砒霜吧

2425
01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.300
yeah. It's upstairs.Sit down. I'll get it.

2426
01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.300
你坐下  我去楼上拿给你

2427
01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:43.100
What's wrong?Does little Carl have a tummy ache?

2428
01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:43.100
怎么了?你胃痛吗?

2429
01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.900
What are you doing?

2430
01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:47.900
你想怎样对付我?

2431
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.800
Now do you believe in ghosts?

2432
01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.800
你现在相信有鬼了?

2433
01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.400
I'll set the place on fire I swear to God.

2434
01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:59.400
我会放火烧这地方

2435
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:08.800
I'll cut her throat.

2436
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:08.800
我会杀死她

2437
01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.400
Carl.

2438
01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.400
卡尔

2439
01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.900
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.

2440
01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.900
我说得出  做得到

2441
01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.800
I need that money and I want it tonight at 11 :00.

2442
01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.800
今晚11时前把钱还给我

2443
01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.100
If that psychic does not bring it here Molly is dead. OK?

2444
01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.100
灵媒不及时拿来  我就杀死慕莉

2445
01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.300
Carl   who are you talking to?

2446
01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.300
你跟谁说话?

2447
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.200
Nothing. Now   Molly   listen to me.

2448
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.200
没有  我要走了

2449
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.750
I can't explain this now but there's a problem OK?

2450
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.750
现在我不能解释

2451
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:36.500
Something at the bank.

2452
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:36.500
银行出了问题

2453
01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.700
Carl   you're scaring me.I'm sorry.

2454
01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.700
你吓倒我了      对不起

2455
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.900
I'll come back about 11 :00.

2456
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.900
我没空说  但我11时会回来

2457
01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:43.900
Why? Why not now?Molly look I'll come back.

2458
01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:43.900
为什么现在不说?      稍后再说

2459
01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.900
Like 11 :00   OK?

2460
01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.900
我11时再回来吧

2461
01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:48.900
Molly  but it's important. Got to go.

2462
01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:48.900
抱歉  但这事很重要  我要走了

2463
01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:50.400
Oda Mae!

我想换个频道

2469

I love Love Connection.I love that man on there.That's Arsenio.

2470
01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.100

2501
01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:04.300
You can't come in.The cat don't like visitors.

2502
01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:04.300
你们不能进来  猫儿怕陌生人

2503
01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.200
She'll pee all over.

2504
01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.200
它会在沙发上撒尿…

2505
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.100
They're going to get us.

2506
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.100
他们会找到我们

2507
01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:20.800
Where's Sam?

2508
01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:20.800
森在哪儿?

2509
01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.400
The bitch just left.I'll check downstairs.

2510
01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.400
那婊子刚离开了      我去搜楼梯

2511
01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:36.300
Carl?

2512
01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:36.300
卡尔?

2513
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:27.700
Willy!

2514
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:27.700
威里

2515

2521
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:42.320
I heard the car. I was standing right there.

2522
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:42.320
我听到车过来了 我就站在这

2523
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:45.080
You could hear it across town.

2524
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:45.080
你能听到它穿过城镇

2525
01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:57.300
That dude is dead.

2526
01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:57.300
那人死了

叫司机快一点

2535
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.700

2541
01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:31.700
Carl is that you?No. It's me Oda Mae. Listen.

2542
01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:31.700
卡尔  是你吗?      我是奥德美

2543
01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:34.700
Molly   I know what you think of me

2544
01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:34.700
我知道你怎样想我

2545
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:37.700
but you are in serious danger.

2546
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:37.700
我们必须一谈  你现在很危险

2547
01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:41.200

森也在这儿  我们想跟你谈谈

2549
01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.700
Get the hell out of here.

2550
01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.700
给我滚

2551
01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:44.200
I'm calling the police.

叫她报警

2555
01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.800
Fine. We want you to call the police.

2556
01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.800
我们正想你报警

2557
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.600
Let us in.  No.

2558
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:50.600
让我们进来  不

2559
01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.650
Look   don't you get it?Sam wasn't just accidentally killed.

2560
01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.650
你还不明白?森的死不是意外

2561
01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:55.900
He was murdered.

2562
01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:55.900
是被人谋杀的

2563
01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:58.900
He found out Carl was laundering money at the bank.

2564
01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:58.900
他发现卡尔在银行替人洗黑钱

2565
01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.300
This guy Carl is dangerous.He tried to kill me.

2566
01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:01.300
卡尔是危险人物 他想杀了我

2567
01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.700
He's going to try to kill you too.

2568
01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.700
他也会杀了你的

2569
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.800
You're in deep trouble.

2570
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.800
你的处境很危险

2571
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.300
Why are you doing this to me?Why are you doing this to me?

2572
01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:11.300
你为什么这样对我?

2573
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.600
Why are you doing this to me?

2574
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:13.600
你听到吗?你为什么这样对我?

2575
01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.000
I can't... I just can't...

2576
01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.000
我不可以…

2577
01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:20.300
Oda Mae. Oda Mae   tell her...tell her

2578
01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:20.300
奥德美 告诉她说

2579
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:23.100
she's wearing the shirt that I spilled the margarita on

2580
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:23.100
她身上的衬衫曾给我弄污

2581
01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.300
and the earrings I gave her for Christmas.

2582
01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.300
耳环是我送给她的圣诞礼物

2583
01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:30.300
Sam says you're wearing the shirt he spilled the margarita on

2584
01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:30.300
森说你身上的衬衫曾给他弄污

2585
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.500
and the earrings he gave you for Christmas.

2586
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:32.500
耳环是他送给你的圣诞礼物

2587
01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:42.800
Don't you see?I'm not a fake. Not about this.

2588
01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:42.800
你还不明白?我这次没骗人

2589
01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:50.500
Give me a penny.  What?

2590
01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:50.500
给我一个硬币      什么?

2591
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:52.300
Push a penny under the door.

2592
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:52.300
把硬币在门下推进去

2593
01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.300
Push a penny under the door?

2594
01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.300
你在说什么?

2595
01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.400
Do it.

2596
01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.400
照做吧

2597
01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.000
Tell her it's for luck.

2598
01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.000
说这是求好运

2599
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.700
Sam says it's for luck.

2600
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.700
森说这是求好运

2601
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.600
We're between Green and Mercer on Prince.

2602
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.600
这儿在格连和马西之间

2603
01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.300
The gray building across from the post office.

我们等你

2609
01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.200
All right. They're on their way.Good.

2615
01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.500
Sam?

2616
01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:45.500
森?

2617
01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:48.500
I'm sitting beside her.

2618
01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:48.500
我坐在她身旁

2619
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:52.000
He's sitting right beside you.

2620
01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:52.000
他坐在你身旁

2621
01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.200
Sam   can you feel me?

2622
01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.200
森  你感觉到我吗?

2623
01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.500
With all my heart.

2624
01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.500
全心全意

2625
01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.700
Says with all his heart.

2626
01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.700
他说全心全意

2627
01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.500
I'd give anything if I could just touch you once more.

2628
01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.500
我愿不惜一切去多接触你一次

2629
01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.400
He says he wishes he was alive again so he could touch you.

2630
01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.400
他说他想多接触你一次

2631
01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:38.800
Me   too.

2632
01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:38.800
我也是

2633
01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:58.100
OK. OK. Look.

2634
01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:58.100
好吧

2635
01:48:58.700 --> 01:48:59.900
You can use me.

2636
01:48:58.700 --> 01:48:59.900
你可以利用我

2637
01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.400
Use you?  You can use my body.

2638
01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:04.400
利用你?   上我的身

2639
01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.300
Use your body?Just do it quick before I change my mind.

2640
01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.300
上你的身?      在我改变主意前

2641
01:50:15.650 --> 01:50:22.700
Oh   my love

2642
01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:26.290
My darling

2643
01:50:26.370 --> 01:50:32.130
I've hungered for your touch

2644
01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:40.590
A long   lonely time

2645
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:49.400
And time goes by

2646
01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:51.610
And time goes by

2647
01:50:51.690 --> 01:50:55.360
So slowly

2648
01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:01.990
And time can do so much

2649
01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:10.460
Are you still mine

2650
01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:15.210
I

2651
01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:18.720
Need your love

2652
01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:24.680
I

2653
01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:27.980
Need your love

2654
01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:31.980
God speed your love

2655
01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:38.110
To me

2656
01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:45.950
Lonely rivers Flow

2657
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:47.830
To the sea

2658
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:49.960
To the sea

2659
01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:53.500
To the open arms

2660
01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:55.500
Of the sea

2661
01:51:55.590 --> 01:51:57.340
Yeah

2662
01:51:57.420 --> 01:52:04.600
Oh   my love

2663
01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:08.270
My darling

2664
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:10.430
I've hungered

2665
01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.190
Hungered for your...

2666
01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.500
Molly!Molly are you home?

2667
01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.500
慕莉?你在吗?

2668
01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:22.200
It's Carl.Fire escape.

2669
01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:22.200
是卡尔      太平梯

2670
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.300
What's happening to me?

2671
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.300
我怎么了?

2672
01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.000
Molly?

2673
01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.000
慕莉?

2674
01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:49.400
Molly!

2675
01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:49.400
慕莉?

2676
01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:51.500
Son of a bitch!

2677
01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:51.500
混蛋

2678
01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:05.900
Come on.

2679
01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:05.900
这边

2680
01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:10.800
Look. Look.

2681
01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:10.800
看

2682
01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:13.800
Let's go. Let's go.All right.

2683
01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:13.800
那边

2684
01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:25.300
Molly!

2685
01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:25.300
慕莉

2686
01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.700
Just get away from us   Carl.

2687
01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.700
别走近我们

2688
01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.400
Molly!

2689
01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.400
慕莉

2690
01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.900
You're just a liar.

2691
01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.900
你是个撒谎鬼

2692
01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.800
Listen to me. This woman's a thief.

2693
01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.800
她是个贼

2694
01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:37.500
She's a con artist.

2695
01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:37.500
是个骗子

2696
01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.500
Why are you doing this?Don't listen to her.

2697
01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.500
你为何这样做?      别相信她

2698
