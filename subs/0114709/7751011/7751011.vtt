1
00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:38.497
I'm John Lasseter.
I co-wrote the original story

2
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.874
and directed the film Toy Story.

3
00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:43.210
-I'm Ralph Guggenheim.
-I'm Bonnie Arnold.

4
00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.212
RALPH GUGGENHEIM, PRODUCER:
Bonnie and I produced Toy Story.

5
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.131
I'm Andrew Stanton.
I'm one of the screenwriters

6
00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.675
and storyboard artists for the film.

7
00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.636
My name's Pete Docter.
I worked on the story

8
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.971
and was supervising animator.

9
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.557
I'm Ralph Eggleston.
I was the art director.

10
00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:01.019
And I'm Bill Reeves, supervising
technical director on Toy Story.

11
00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:02.771
JOHN LASSETER, CO-WRITER/
DIRECTOR: We're here to give you

12
00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.189
audio commentary
for the wonderful Toy Story.

13
00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:10.320
When we started this whole idea,
it seemed to be very doable

14
00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:14.157
in that computer graphics tend to make
things look plastic-y anyway,

15
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:17.494
So we might as well
do a story about toys.

16
00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:21.248
And you and I, Bill,
we did Tin Toy, that short film,

17
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:25.377
which kind of introduced the whole
notion of these toys being alive.

18
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.920
PETE DOCTER, SUPERVISING
ANIMATOR: The first time

19
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.506
we see Woody
is a classic Western introduction.

20
00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:31.716
JL: We wanted to have it

21
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.095
sort of a child's version
of a Western movie,

22
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.431
and as he starts playing,

23
00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:40.976
it gets into the sort of kid-like
non sequitur sort of thing.

24
00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:43.770
ANDREW STANTON, CO-WRITER:
Kid's logic. It's logical for the kid, but...

25
00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:46.273
JL: Right. The fact that
he would have a force field.

26
00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:50.652
JL: The force field and then...
RG: The dinosaurs.

27
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.780
AS: Here's an interesting thing.
So many people

28
00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:56.533
didn't know that Molly
was in the same room with Andy.

29
00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.411
The crib's in there all the time,
but people never...

30
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:02.873
I guess we just didn't sell it enough,
that Molly shares the room with him.

31
00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:06.668
People thought
Bo Peep was Andy's toy.

32
00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.045
RG: And then we have this

33
00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.131
amazing opening song
by Randy Newman,

34
00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.966
who did the songs and the score.

35
00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.344
I remember the first time
that we sat down and listened to Randy

36
00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.638
sing this song just on the piano.

37
00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.515
We talked about the emotions,

38
00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.851
some of the feelings
we wanted in the song.

39
00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.145
BONNIE ARNOLD, PRODUCER:
We likened it to Harold and Maude

40
00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.105
and The Graduate,

41
00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.942
where songs actually told about
an emotional moment in the film,

42
00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:33.820
rather than the character
singing about those things.

43
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:36.615
It made this seem
more contemporary and realistic,

44
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:39.242
and I think that's what John
was trying to go for.

45
00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.995
AS: In a short amount of time,
we needed to show

46
00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.623
that Andy and Woody
had this lifelong bond,

47
00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.959
but we don't have the whole movie.
We wanna disrupt that soon,

48
00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:51.796
and it was great. When we heard
Randy's song, we knew this did I,

49
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.174
this made you feel
like they were inseparable.

50
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.342
RG: It did more than that.

51
00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.428
It defined much of the theme
of the movie for us.

52
00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:02.098
JL: And we used this song
at the end, over the end credits.

53
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.768
In the beginning
it's about Andy and Woody,

54
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.938
and at the end,
it's Woody's relationship with Buzz.

55
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:12.734
When Ralph and your crew...

56
00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.694
You designed all these sets.

57
00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:18.073
I mean, this world
is a really three-dimensional world.

58
00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.325
It's different than cell animation.

59
00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.786
I mean, these are truly
dimensional sets.

60
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:23.995
RALPH EGGLESTON,
ART DIRECTOR: The living room

61
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.789
was the first we got into,

62
00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:30.043
and there's so much detail you
never really get a close look at.

63
00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:35.840
JL: I remember you said that
you wanted to give a sense of history

64
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.635
to this world
so that when people looked at it,

65
00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.971
it looks like people have lived
in these houses.

66
00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.975
Bill, you would get all these designs.

67
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.269
They were more or less like blueprints.

68
00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.479
BILL REEVES, SUPERVISING
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR: You'd get this

69
00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:52.482
packet of information,
which was a specification of what they...

70
00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.943
What these objects really looked like.

71
00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.404
It was as if we had
to build them out of wood

72
00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.573
or clay or plastic or whatever.

73
00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.078
AS: And now Woody
comes to life for the first time.

74
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.372
PD: Slow track in.
JL: Directed by John Lasseter.

75
00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.709
JL: My credit's
the longest one in the movie.

76
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.794
It's one frame longer than yours.

77
00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:14.588
PD: The first line Woody should say,

78
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.590
we went through so many revisions.

79
00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:20.260
-We have pages of Woody's first line.
-RG: As many pages as we have titles.

80
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.887
AS: There's a lot of pressure,
the first thing he says.

81
00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.265
PD: He should have an edge,
but not too edgy,

82
00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.641
'cause it's for kids, too.

83
00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.732
JL: In casting the toys,

84
00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:37.986
we really looked at what kind
of personality we wanted them to have,

85
00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.239
and a lot it was drawn out
of the type of toy it was.

86
00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:45.201
Mr. Potato Head's a classic example,
'cause one characteristic of the toy

87
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.287
is that it's constantly losing its parts,

88
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.373
and we thought it would
have a chip on its shoulder.

89
00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:55.170
Don Rickles was the first actor
that we thought for this...

90
00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:58.882
AS: The only choice we had.
JL: Yeah, he was great.

91
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.135
The definitive army man

92
00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.179
is the drill sergeant

93
00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:08.308
in Full Metal Jacket,
and so we cast him.

94
00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:11.186
AS: Now Slinky is the last character
to finally be cast.

95
00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:15.106
We actually remodeled him
because of Jim Varney's voice.

96
00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.985
BA: Well, I think Jim brought
the hound dog sort of quality to I,

97
00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.988
but he was a person,
and had that sort of kind of voice

98
00:05:22.072 --> 00:05:25.158
that's just more, I guess cartoon-y,
for lack of a better word,

99
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.285
without sort of putting on a voice.

100
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.497
JL: One of the things
about Etch A Sketch is,

101
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.333
in bringing toys to life, we thought...
Everybody draws

102
00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:35.502
on an Etch A Sketch so badly,

103
00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.462
we wanted Etch A Sketch,
if he was alive,

104
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.757
be able to do crosshatching
and absolutely exquisite circles.

105
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.051
AS: Well, he would naturally
be the best at it.

106
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.888
Jurassic Park had come out
when we were designing Rex,

107
00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.683
and we decided it would be great
to have a slant on T. rex

108
00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.142
and have him be insecure.

109
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:55.230
JL: Well, first of all, the coolest
dinosaur there is, is a T. rex.

110
00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:56.690
So we had to have a T. rex,

111
00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.526
and then we played him against type,
made him neurotic.

112
00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.528
RG: The most neurotic carnivore
ever to walk the earth.

113
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.280
AS: Vestigial arms, not being
able to touch their own nose.

114
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.200
JL: They are pathetic.
The most pathetic things...

115
00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.244
He's the most fearsome
creature to walk the Earth,

116
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.788
but he can't scratch his nose.

117
00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.875
In designing the characters,

118
00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.586
we really studied real toys.

119
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.673
Remember that? We would go to
Toys R Us all the time?

120
00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.050
I was in heaven.
Remember we went to Toys R Us

121
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.678
and bought toys with the company
credit card during work hours?

122
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:29.889
RE: Collected toys and everybody
had their own they would bring in.

123
00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.015
JL: Right.

124
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.477
This kind of brings up
the point that we wanted to...

125
00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.397
To mix toys that we made up

126
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.150
along with existing toys
that were out there.

127
00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:43.403
We kept giving Ralph a list of...

128
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.780
"Hey, Ralph, let's get Little Tikes.

129
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.450
"Hey, Ralph, let's get Tinkertoys."

130
00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:51.911
RG: The hours I spent on the phone
with Mr. Potato Head's lawyer,

131
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.748
trying to work out the use
of Mr. Potato Head in our movie.

132
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.042
JL: It's true. "We gotta have him."
AS: We only picked existing toys

133
00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.377
that have withstood the test of time,

134
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.254
that have gone through
one or two generations

135
00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:02.881
and that would be around

136
00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.425
even if this movie's
watched 10, 20 years from now.

137
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:09.220
JL: In fact, a Slinky Dog
was the only toy that we used

138
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.639
that wasn't currently in production.

139
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.020
PD: The books behind Woody
are Pixar films.

140
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.439
AS: That's where the most pauses
are going to happen,

141
00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.274
to read the bindings on the books.

142
00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.777
JL: The other thing to look at
is in a lot of scenes

143
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.615
we have funny little sayings
across Mr. Spell's readout.

144
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.533
That's his dialogue.

145
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.036
PD: "The staff meeting."

146
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:36.998
JL: Well, we thought, in analyzing toys
and the purpose of toys,

147
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:40.335
they are manufactured
to be played with by a child.

148
00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:44.005
But they could look at being
played with by a child as their job.

149
00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:46.549
And so, if they all look at this as a job,

150
00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.177
this is their workplace
when Andy leaves.

151
00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.930
Naturally, at every workplace
you have staff meetings.

152
00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:55.725
RG: This is the scene that we probably
story boarded and re-story boarded

153
00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:59.395
and wrote and rewrote more often
than any other scene in the movie.

154
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:03.399
AS: Kissing his butt right there
was the definitive joke for the movie.

155
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:06.778
JL: It's really funny to watch
audience's faces when they see that.

156
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.823
It's all of a sudden,
"Did I see what I just saw?

157
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.659
"This is a Disney movie and he's..."

158
00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.620
AS: It set the tone for
the rest of the movie. It said,

159
00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:17.497
"Get ready for irreverence."

160
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.542
JL: And because there was
a real attention

161
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:24.170
to the adult audience
and the teenage audience in Toy Story.

162
00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.506
We really wanted to make this for kids,

163
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:30.385
but also make it
so the adults would enjoy it as well.

164
00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:35.181
One of the animators, Doug Sweet land,
worked on these scenes

165
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.017
where Woody gets run over
by all the toys,

166
00:08:38.101 --> 00:08:41.479
and he worked on them
for such a long period of time

167
00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:45.692
that, when he finished
that one scene, he had a wrap party.

168
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:48.069
AS: He had his own wrap party
for the one scene.

169
00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:51.489
PD: It was good chocolate cake
that he made for himself.

170
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:53.533
JL: Hamm the piggy bank

171
00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.702
we thought of
as being a Mr. Know-It-All,

172
00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.204
'cause he sits there on the shelf
and stares out the window all day.

173
00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.331
He knows more
than the rest of the toys.

174
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:03.334
So we cast John Ratzenberger,

175
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.628
who played Cliff the mailman
from Cheers.

176
00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.213
And this guy came in,

177
00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:10.425
and he was so amazing at ad-libs.

178
00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:14.637
"Cause the character of Hamm
was just one-liners all the time.

179
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.514
So for every line he had,

180
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:19.809
he gave us 10 hilarious alternatives,

181
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:23.521
and he just kept ad-libbing.
In fact, we found we just ran the tape

182
00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:26.399
-and let him come up with all this...
-AS: Keep going.

183
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:30.653
AS: And now comes everybody's
favorite sequence.

184
00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:34.115
BA: Well, this is the very first
sequence that we...

185
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.492
Basically that we boarded
and that we animated.

186
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.578
RG: It got shown around quite a bit,

187
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.664
and it also really epitomized
the essence of the story.

188
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:45.919
When these soldiers start walking,
you know a lot about the world of toys

189
00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.087
that's going to be created in this movie.

190
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.089
BA: And I think there's not
one guy out there

191
00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:53.051
that does not relate
to these green army men.

192
00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:54.844
I haven't met one yet.

193
00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.638
JL: In analyzing the green army men,

194
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.765
we realized there were
three basic things

195
00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.643
we had to have in the model.
One, they're badly molded,

196
00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:03.603
so they had all that extra plastic,

197
00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.773
the mold flashing that was
sticking out of their heads.

198
00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.441
Their gun barrels are bent,

199
00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:10.944
and their feet are always
attached to those bases.

200
00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:14.113
And when the paratroopers go off,

201
00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:15.823
"cause I love those...

202
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:19.035
And they had to have them hooked
with a big ring on their head.

203
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.745
-I love that.
-RG: We were always...

204
00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:23.331
The first times we showed it,
we were surprised

205
00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.833
because we thought them
going off the balcony

206
00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.586
was sort of a big,
dramatic moment in the scene.

207
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.923
And, instead, it always
gets a huge laugh.

208
00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.847
JL: We had to have them freeze
in their classic army man poses.

209
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.432
It was a must.

210
00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:47.563
JL: Green army men's feet are attached
to their bases, that's how they walk.

211
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:51.609
So we thought when she actually
steps on one of the guys,

212
00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:55.196
his base breaks off,
and that's why he can't walk.

213
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.490
But it's one of those definitive scenes

214
00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:00.410
that you have in all army pictures,

215
00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.620
is the injured soldier saying,

216
00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.539
"Go on. Go on without me."

217
00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.499
AS: Right. You had to put that in.

218
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:09.627
JL: The Sarge...
One of the themes of this is teamwork,

219
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:12.547
working together. It reinforced
the theme of the whole movie

220
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.007
for him to say...

221
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.969
AS: "A good soldier never
leaves a man behind."

222
00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:20.513
RG: Right out of Sergeant Rock
and all those movies.

223
00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:22.724
JL: Pete, tell them about the way...

224
00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:26.686
PD: I took some old tennis shoes
and nailed them to a big board,

225
00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:30.023
and we tried running around
to get the animation quality of,

226
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:33.192
"How would you move
with this board strapped to your feet?"

227
00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.153
And it's actually really hard.

228
00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.741
JL: Oh, this is an interesting trivia thing.

229
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.576
No one's noticed that we have

230
00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.578
the wrong end of a baby monitor
down there.

231
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.205
AS: For those parents there,
they probably caught it.

232
00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:49.876
JL: That's the end you listen to.
RE: Not the end you talk into.

233
00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:54.297
JL: In the original script, we had
two-way conversations between them.

234
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.215
"Come in."
"We're right here."

235
00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:59.218
We were like, wait a minute,
it's a one-way radio.

236
00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:06.684
JL: But even the staging
of this whole Army Man scene

237
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:09.520
was done very much in the flavor of,

238
00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:14.358
like, combat in the classic army films.

239
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.282
PD: More movie magic.
How can he actually see

240
00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:23.493
through plastic green binoculars?

241
00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.456
BA: At this point,
you're really engrossed

242
00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:30.416
in the story that's going on,

243
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.335
even though you
haven't even met Buzz.

244
00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:36.631
In my mind, the Army Man sequence
is really when it sort of...

245
00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:40.093
You're just caught up in it
at that moment.

246
00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.595
JL: The Sarge there
did silent hand signals,

247
00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:44.597
and we actually got a list from,

248
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.100
I think it was the Marines or the Army,

249
00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:50.812
of actual silent
hand signals that they use.

250
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:55.358
AS: It's funny, technically, or from
a story point, it's the one sequence

251
00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.361
where we're not advancing
the story as fast as we were

252
00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:02.115
with the rest of the movie, but you
wanna watch this moment so much...

253
00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.699
It's like, who cares?

254
00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:08.996
Notice, if you caught that,
Potato Head is Catholic.

255
00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:14.168
JL: Well, it's Irish Catholic.
AS: It makes sense.

256
00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:17.839
JL: I really love the fact
that the toys are so knowledgeable

257
00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.174
about the batteries.

258
00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:22.635
It just shows the intelligence of the toys

259
00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:25.263
and the knowledge
that they have of this world.

260
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.223
AS: It's like looking at your own kids.

261
00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:28.766
They have different priorities
in their life

262
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.810
that are very serious
and important to them,

263
00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.271
and for them,
something like batteries falling,

264
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.648
coming out or dealing
with them is a big deal.

265
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.151
JL: The other thing is
this sets up beautifully

266
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.403
that these characters know they're toys.

267
00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:43.447
They know they are plastic
and run on batteries,

268
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.075
and they're fully aware of their world,

269
00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:49.078
so it sets it up nicely
when Buzz comes into the room

270
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.997
and he's fully unaware he's a toy.

271
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.584
AS: We purposely did that so that
there would be that contrast.

272
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.336
JL: As the kids
come into the room here,

273
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.465
we wanted to have the feeling and
staging and animation and everything

274
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.467
of a whirlwind.

275
00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.595
Even Gary Rydstrom,
our sound designer,

276
00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.848
we had him just make it loud
and noisy and just an explosion.

277
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:12.852
AS: That impact when the door opens,
it hits people's chest in the theaters.

278
00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:15.688
JL: Then he purposely
took all the sound out right here,

279
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:17.565
so it's almost completely silent.

280
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.193
And it reinforced
the feeling of that whirlwind.

281
00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.863
RG: The vacuum that occurs
after the whirlwind's gone.

282
00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:31.454
JL: Early on in the development
of the story, we had this image,

283
00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.664
this idea of setting up the world,

284
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.833
and this character is...

285
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:40.379
It is the top toy, is Andy's favorite toy,

286
00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.548
and the way visually to show that

287
00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:44.800
is he has the spot on the bed.

288
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:47.887
And by setting up that spot on the bed,

289
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.306
and none of the other toys
are on the bed,

290
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.642
it's so clear when he's knocked off

291
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.895
and something else is put up there,
it says it right away

292
00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:58.940
-and that's what I think that...
-AS: And people catch that, I think.

293
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:05.571
AS: And now...
RG: The moment of discovery.

294
00:15:05.655 --> 00:15:08.241
RE: Buzz is the only white,
fully white character

295
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.951
of all of the characters here.

296
00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:12.995
Everything else has got lots of color.

297
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:16.415
In some of the early ones Buzz was red.
That was cute for the tests,

298
00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.750
it works fine.

299
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:21.003
But we needed something that
set him apart. He's brand-new...

300
00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:24.173
AS: Oh, wait, here comes
the Darth Vader POV.

301
00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:25.341
JL: Oh, that's right.

302
00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:28.135
AS: What would it look like
from Darth Vader's POV?

303
00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.096
RG: A brief Star Wars homage.

304
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:33.474
JL: There's a lot of brief
Star Wars homages in this movie.

305
00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:37.103
PD: Seeing his own reflection
in the glass is really cool, too.

306
00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:39.647
It's something you couldn't
really do normally.

307
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.608
JL: Yeah, this is one of those things
that with this medium,

308
00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:43.901
you can do things you can't do

309
00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.654
in hand-drawn animation
nor in live action.

310
00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:50.324
In thinking of what kind of toy
Buzz Light year would be,

311
00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:52.576
we went back and we thought

312
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.204
of all of our favorite toys as a kid,

313
00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:59.250
and tried to put in every cool thing
we could remember in one toy.

314
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:01.502
He's about the size of a GI Joe.

315
00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:05.047
-You had Big Jim.
-AS: I wanted the karate-chop action.

316
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.508
JL: The little wrist communicator...

317
00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:10.720
AS: Which came from
the Big Jim Wolf Pack.

318
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:14.473
On the cover inside, 'cause we actually
had the doll, it said "Made in China."

319
00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:17.810
That gave us the idea for
"Made in Taiwan" to use later.

320
00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:21.647
JL: And we had this newer toy,
the Video Warrior,

321
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.317
that had those hilarious
sampled voice sounds,

322
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.153
and we thought, "This is
definitely more of a modern toy

323
00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.405
"that would have all this LED lights up,

324
00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:33.534
"and the sampled sound and,
of course, he had to glow in the dark."

325
00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:37.330
And Bob Pauley, one of
the key designers in this film,

326
00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.498
he did an amazing job in taking all that

327
00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:42.376
and designing it to be,
like, the toy of our dreams.

328
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.546
AS: I remember John saying,
"I feel sorry for the toy company

329
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:47.089
"that's gotta make this."

330
00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:51.677
RG: You topped it with the most modern
of appliances, a laser on his arm.

331
00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:54.638
PD: It's not a laser.
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

332
00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:57.308
JL: There's a hint of retro design to him,

333
00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:01.437
with the big clear globe for his head.

334
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:04.857
-It's one of those things...
-AS: Based on NASA, astronaut suits...

335
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.277
JL: Right, when the astronauts
come out and climb in there,

336
00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:10.696
they had that really cool, clear helmet.

337
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.114
You know, glass helmet.

338
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:15.117
RG: It's all offset when he opens
his wrist communicator

339
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:18.162
with the cheesy decal
that's underneath there.

340
00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:19.955
AS: It's funny, we never...

341
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.124
When it came to casting both of them,

342
00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:24.168
we always had Tom Hanks in mind

343
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:26.212
and we had nobody else we wanted,

344
00:17:26.295 --> 00:17:28.297
and we were so thankful
when we got him.

345
00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:32.051
Tim Allen was John's idea.
He came out with Home Improvement.

346
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.388
-A lot of us hadn't heard of him.
-JL: I was a big fan...

347
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:38.057
Yeah, but I was a big fan
and I thought he could do it.

348
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.851
And what's interesting
is our original idea

349
00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:44.480
for the personality of Buzz
was much more, he was a superhero.

350
00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:47.483
-He was aware he was a superhero.
-PD: "I'll save you, young space cadet!"

351
00:17:47.608 --> 00:17:48.776
PD: Yeah, sort of like Space Ghost.

352
00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.363
JL: And it was more over the top.

353
00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:55.866
Tim Allen came in, and the first
recording session in Detroit,

354
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.078
remember? He was on hiatus
and we went back to Detroit,

355
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:02.623
and he did it and he played it
much more like a regular guy.

356
00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:06.710
And at first we thought,
"This isn't anything like we expected."

357
00:18:06.794 --> 00:18:09.588
And we started cutting it in
and we realized,

358
00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:11.841
"No, wait a minute, this is better."

359
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.760
So from that we kind of
evolved the character

360
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.262
from being a superhero

361
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:19.890
to more of being like a cop,
a really well-trained space cop.

362
00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:22.309
And he was much
more honest that way.

363
00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.603
He looked at everything
very straight-on.

364
00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:28.399
AS: And it made him absolutely funnier
to take himself more seriously.

365
00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:31.610
JL: The audience can relate
to him much more, you know?

366
00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:34.947
AS: To the level you expect
when you see a live-action actor.

367
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.450
It was great to be able
to play with all that.

368
00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:40.619
JL: We actually met Tom Hanks
for the first time,

369
00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:42.955
he had just finished
filming Philadelphia.

370
00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:46.167
And so we actually worked with him

371
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.793
through the filming

372
00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:51.005
of both Forrest Gump and Apollo 13.

373
00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:53.966
AS: Matter of fact,
when we made the deal,

374
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:57.052
Philadelphia had yet to come out,
and those other two movies,

375
00:18:57.136 --> 00:19:00.347
and so it's funny... The same
with Tim Allen's show skyrocketing.

376
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:03.184
They became superstars
after we got them signed.

377
00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.769
We were just like,
"Thank you, God!"

378
00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:08.522
That was happening
while we were making this movie.

379
00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:12.943
JL: In this upcoming scene
where Buzz flies around the room,

380
00:19:13.027 --> 00:19:15.738
it's sort of a
Rube Goldberg kind of thing.

381
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.032
But we have Buzz close his eyes,

382
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.743
So in his mind
he is flying around the room.

383
00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:24.580
It is so impressive, the fact that
he just happens to land on this ball,

384
00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:28.667
and, of course, we had
to have Hot Wheels in this movie.

385
00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:31.420
If you have a Hot Wheels,
and you have to choose one car,

386
00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.298
-it had to be the Red Baron.
-AS: There was no argument on that.

387
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:37.843
JL: No argument on that,
'cause we're all Hot Wheels aficionados.

388
00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:41.388
RG: And no argument about the ball.
That ball shows up in Luxo Jr.

389
00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:43.349
and in other Pixar films over the years.

390
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:45.434
JL: There's a lot of
Pixar in-jokes throughout.

391
00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.353
The Hot Wheels track is orange,

392
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:50.022
-which they hadn't made in 15 years.
-AS: It showed our age,

393
00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:52.483
that's what we remember
Hot Wheels tracks being.

394
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:54.860
JL: They're different colors.
AS: Flames.

395
00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:57.780
PD: Kids these days.
AS: I don't know, it's gone to pot.

396
00:19:57.863 --> 00:20:00.074
JL: Originally, we had
different sequences

397
00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:02.368
showing Woody losing his world.

398
00:20:02.451 --> 00:20:05.371
They talked about it,
we showed it in different ways.

399
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:08.541
And Tom Schumacher,
the Senior VP at Disney

400
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.918
in charge of Development
for Feature Animation,

401
00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:15.381
he recommended, "Why don't you do it
as a song, as sort of a montage?"

402
00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.092
It was, like,
"Ding! I could have had a V8!"

403
00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:19.301
It was a great idea.

404
00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:22.638
So, what we did is we came up
with all of these vignettes

405
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.724
of how Woody's world would change.

406
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.894
I know what happens in my house
is when we get a new toy,

407
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:32.731
it's like they have to get the sheets
and the pajamas and everything.

408
00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.442
That's what we wanted to show.
Buzz Light year really is

409
00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.487
merchandising from
some mythical show.

410
00:20:39.363 --> 00:20:41.865
And so we thought,
not only would there be a toy,

411
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:44.577
but there would be all the stuff
that comes with a toy.

412
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.871
And so there's one scene
in Strange Things here,

413
00:20:47.955 --> 00:20:50.416
that to me is one of
the most telling scenes

414
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.710
in the whole movie,

415
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.004
is the bed was Woody's domain.

416
00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:57.423
And in that one scene, it's replaced

417
00:20:57.506 --> 00:21:01.260
with this gigantic image
of Buzz Light year.

418
00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.928
So he lost his place,

419
00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:06.265
and I think that's one of the most
telling scenes in the whole film.

420
00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:09.935
One of the things we tried to do, too,
is have moments with Buzz

421
00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:12.021
and the other toys that kind of reflect

422
00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:14.898
things that Woody
was doing with the toys.

423
00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:18.861
Ash Brannon, who's one
of the directing animators,

424
00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.363
he did this great stuff of the exercising.

425
00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:23.115
PD: Checking the pulse.

426
00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:26.785
RG: It's too bad.
It never really reads that you can see

427
00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:30.623
that Mr. Spell is actually reading out
how many calories Buzz is burning.

428
00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:37.838
JL: Well, I love this.
Woody is just losing control.

429
00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:43.302
We've established earlier in the film
that he has control over everything.

430
00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.429
He can send the green army men down.

431
00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:47.973
Buzz arrives, he's losing control.

432
00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:51.518
AS: Right. It's like there were two
worlds that Woody had connected.

433
00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:54.605
He's losing Andy
and his allegiance with all the toys.

434
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:58.400
His sense of leadership with them.

435
00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.487
RG: What's great about this is
you reveal more about Woody

436
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.406
in his reaction shots
than you do when he's speaking.

437
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.743
It's about his non-spoken reactions,
non-verbal reactions.

438
00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:10.704
JL: We wrote the dialogue
in wanting to say one thing,

439
00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:12.831
but through the acting,

440
00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:15.501
and the way that Tom Hanks
and the actors performed it

441
00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:16.919
is to give the subtext

442
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:20.130
that it's something
completely different they're feeling.

443
00:22:20.214 --> 00:22:21.715
AS: That comes back to the eyes.

444
00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:24.551
We're fortunate
because of the believability

445
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:28.180
and the look of this medium.
People almost treat it like live-action.

446
00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:31.684
We're allowed to do things with eyes
to the level of what you expect

447
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.560
when you see a live-action actor,

448
00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:35.729
and it was great to play with all that.

449
00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:38.774
It's such a great thing, adding...

450
00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:40.984
I think it was John's idea

451
00:22:41.068 --> 00:22:43.696
of Andy putting his name
on the bottom of his toys.

452
00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:45.656
And it became such a great device

453
00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:48.951
for ownership,
for bonds between Andy...

454
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:52.246
PD: It was really a visual symbol
of the bond between them.

455
00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:55.374
JL: It also showed the distance
that time has come,

456
00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:58.752
because the "Andy"
written on Woody's foot

457
00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:00.087
is like a little kid.

458
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.841
I think some letters are backwards
and it's almost scratched off.

459
00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:07.344
RG: Now we come to one of
your favorite moments, Bonnie.

460
00:23:07.428 --> 00:23:10.973
BA: I think it's one of my favorite
acting moments, is what it really is.

461
00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:14.184
RG: I think it's a great revelation
of the power of animation

462
00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:16.019
to convey character and story.

463
00:23:16.103 --> 00:23:18.188
And it's all done in this one shot here.

464
00:23:18.313 --> 00:23:20.691
Woody doesn't do much more
than turn his head.

465
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.235
And yet it conveys so much

466
00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:25.070
of Woody's personality

467
00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:27.990
and his belief
that Buzz is a complete buffoon.

468
00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:31.535
JL: I remember in that scene,

469
00:23:31.618 --> 00:23:34.663
when Woody accidentally
opens Buzz's helmet.

470
00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:37.374
Doug Sweet land did
a really rough pass on it.

471
00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:41.587
And he has this great overacting
of Buzz gasping for air

472
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.922
and falling down
at Woody's feet and stuff.

473
00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:46.717
And then he didn't have time
to do the scene of Woody,

474
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.511
so he just had Woody
literally just turn his head.

475
00:23:49.595 --> 00:23:51.555
And I remember seeing it in dailies,

476
00:23:51.638 --> 00:23:53.682
-and we were on the floor laughing.
-RE: Contrast is great.

477
00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:59.229
JL: And I said,
"Don't animate that shot.

478
00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:01.398
"Just add a little eye blink,

479
00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:03.859
"that's it, you're done!"
It is so hilarious.

480
00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:05.110
PD: He didn't listen to you.

481
00:24:05.194 --> 00:24:09.490
JL: He over-animated it and I made him
go and strip out all of his animation.

482
00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.913
JL: I remember the recording session
with Tom Hanks doing this.

483
00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.748
We would wear Tom Hanks out

484
00:24:17.831 --> 00:24:21.418
every single recording session.
He would leave...

485
00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:25.380
He said his diaphragm hurt
for three days after recording.

486
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:29.134
AS: He'd say, "I think all my character
does is scream in this movie."

487
00:24:29.218 --> 00:24:31.011
And we'd go,
"No. Don't worry."

488
00:24:31.094 --> 00:24:34.181
JL: But that laugh, it's so funny.

489
00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:37.059
It just goes on and on,
and it really made that scene.

490
00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.393
BA: This is the moment when

491
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.896
Sid is introduced into the picture.
Our villain.

492
00:24:41.063 --> 00:24:44.650
JL: And Sid Phillips,
the bad kid next door,

493
00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:48.278
is really Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft

494
00:24:48.362 --> 00:24:51.615
-wrapped together.
-AS: Our childhoods together.

495
00:24:51.698 --> 00:24:54.910
JL: Joe would trash his toys so fast.

496
00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:58.664
He said that, like, Christmas evening,
all of his toys were broken.

497
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:02.334
That he got that morning.
And actually, I remember Andrew,

498
00:25:02.417 --> 00:25:04.211
you were telling me a story,

499
00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:06.964
what you did to one of your
broken GI Joes as a kid,

500
00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:11.301
and I said, "That has got
to be the introduction of Sid."

501
00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:14.721
AS: So him with the Combat Carl

502
00:25:14.805 --> 00:25:17.349
there in the backyard,
is something I actually did

503
00:25:17.432 --> 00:25:19.184
with Keith Nolton when we were eight,

504
00:25:19.268 --> 00:25:21.562
out in his parents' field.

505
00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:24.773
And we strapped an M-80
to the back of a GI Joe...

506
00:25:24.857 --> 00:25:26.692
JL: Then you put him
in a running pose.

507
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:29.027
AS: And said, "Run!
You're never gonna make it!"

508
00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:32.739
-And you blew him up.
-RG: Keith, is he out on parole?

509
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:37.286
BA: Actually, if you look closely...

510
00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:39.705
It may be obscured,
but there are body parts

511
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:43.208
that go flying up in the air
from the poor toy soldier,

512
00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:45.460
and I think there was
a moment of concern

513
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:47.212
about how gruesome that would be.

514
00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:49.214
JL: Well, we wanted GI Joe.

515
00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:52.718
'Cause I had GI Joes as I was a kid.
I lived for my GI Joes.

516
00:25:52.801 --> 00:25:54.720
GI Joes and Hot Wheels
were important.

517
00:25:54.803 --> 00:25:56.513
But they wouldn't let us use it.

518
00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:59.391
Hasbro wouldn't let us use it,
because we'd blow him up.

519
00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:01.768
RG: They didn't like
us blowing up their favorite toy.

520
00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:05.480
JL: Loren Carpenter...
RG: One of our technical directors.

521
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:08.150
AS: Came up with Virtual Reality.
JL: Virtual Realty.

522
00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:10.861
AS: Virtual Realty.
See, I can't even say it.

523
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:13.071
PD: I thought only
a few people would get...

524
00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:16.575
JL: Everybody gets it.
RG: The adults always get it, yeah.

525
00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:19.912
BA: This sequence up here
in Andy's room is SO nice

526
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:22.706
just because it's sort of
a magic hour lighting,

527
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:24.166
and it's so beautiful.

528
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:25.918
They really did a good job.

529
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:29.212
JL: "Get off me!"
RG: "Get outta here."

530
00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:32.174
BA: The Magic 8-Ball is such
a big hit at this moment.

531
00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:35.093
JL: Had to be there.
RG: Even Woody consults the 8-Ball.

532
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:37.346
PD: We studied all the options
of what he could say.

533
00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:39.681
AS: "Don't count on it"
was the winner.

534
00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:42.100
RG: It was a great revelation
about the world of toys,

535
00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:46.229
that these toys know how to use
each other is appropriate, right?

536
00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:50.025
JL: Woody's basically a nice guy,
but he's been pushed to the edge.

537
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:52.361
And this is sort of an innocent thing,

538
00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.947
he's just trying to get
him stuck behind the desk,

539
00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.198
which we all know

540
00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.033
is a place you lose toys.

541
00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.826
And when we were designing this

542
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.829
we were sitting there
watching Raiders of the Lost Ark,

543
00:27:02.913 --> 00:27:06.458
and we looked at it and we said,
"This is what we want."

544
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:09.211
We want that
giant boulder rolling down,

545
00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:13.423
where the escalation goes,
and it's gotten way out of hand.

546
00:27:13.507 --> 00:27:16.259
And even the sound
of the push pins flying down

547
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.428
and hitting on the desk around Buzz,

548
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:21.390
those are actually the sound effects
from that sequence.

549
00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:24.977
So we have the arrows in the beginning
of Raiders of the Lost Ark

550
00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:27.521
and also the actual sound

551
00:27:27.604 --> 00:27:30.941
of the big boulder rolling from Raiders.

552
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:35.988
Craig Good did
a great job in staging this,

553
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:39.324
so that with these,
he called them Spielberg cams,

554
00:27:39.408 --> 00:27:40.867
these camera moves would...

555
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:43.996
Swoop under Woody and Buzz both,

556
00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:47.457
to give this impending,
"Oh, my goodness."

557
00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:50.127
PD: Originally we had
Woody intentionally

558
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.004
push Buzz out of the window.

559
00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:53.964
JL: But he was going too far.

560
00:27:54.047 --> 00:27:57.050
And so that's why we made it
much more of an innocent...

561
00:27:57.134 --> 00:28:00.012
PD: He meant to just stick him
behind the dresser.

562
00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:03.557
-The Lassie reference.
-AS: "What is it, boy?"

563
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.267
JL: Andrew and I were driving once,

564
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.270
and we came up with this idea
that R.C. can't talk,

565
00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.105
and so they communicate to him.

566
00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:12.065
And so it's like a Lassie movie.

567
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:14.609
AS: "What is it, boy?
He's trying to say something."

568
00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.987
JL: Yeah, he's like,
"Timmy's down a well?"

569
00:28:18.613 --> 00:28:20.532
PD: The lighting here I really like, too.

570
00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:24.786
It's a dramatic warm and cool
that really punches the attitude.

571
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.873
RE: That's important to me,
because it's supporting the story

572
00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:31.418
and the emotion and kind of
helping ground it visually.

573
00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:35.047
JL: I love that,
"I don't like confrontations."

574
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:39.051
AS: Being chewed out by a little green
army man... You just wouldn't want to.

575
00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:41.261
JL: Lee Ermey,
in the recording session,

576
00:28:41.344 --> 00:28:43.555
JL: it's like we said,
"Okay, this is it."

577
00:28:43.638 --> 00:28:46.475
And he actually wrote some of that

578
00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:49.352
being chewed out,
and he says it's like poetry.

579
00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:51.646
He took a deep breath
and just laid into it.

580
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.982
And I think the needles
went to red on that.

581
00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:58.111
And he just chewed out Woody
like you can't believe.

582
00:28:58.195 --> 00:29:00.405
PD: This is the most difficult
scene in the film,

583
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:02.741
but Ash Brannon got to animate.

584
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.160
JL: The most complex.
RG: Everything's animated.

585
00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:08.789
JL: Having all those army men
climb all over him...

586
00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:11.583
AS: All the characters...
RG: Then everything goes to quiet.

587
00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:14.252
JL: And this is one of
the funniest scenes, I think.

588
00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:16.588
After Andy's coming
and looking for Buzz,

589
00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:20.175
and Woody looks over and sees
Potato Head and Etch A Sketch.

590
00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:22.177
It's a really... It's very funny,

591
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.514
but it also is such a great
story point that he is dead meat.

592
00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:27.015
RG: This really seals his fate.

593
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:29.559
AS: And you don't have
to do it with dialogue.

594
00:29:30.227 --> 00:29:32.020
NARRATOR: Director John Lasseter.

595
00:29:32.104 --> 00:29:35.816
JL: I think we all had this feeling
of when we finally saw this stuff lit,

596
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:38.068
-it was just, like...
-AS: We're outside!

597
00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:41.446
JL: To this point in the movie
everything pretty much was inside

598
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.074
or looking out to Sid's backyard.

599
00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:45.992
NARRATOR: Art director
Ralph Eggleston.

600
00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:48.036
RE: It really blew everybody away.

601
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.790
It was the first glimpse
of the outside world we got in 3-D.

602
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:54.876
It wasn't just a flat
or a painting like it's been up to now.

603
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.629
JL: Barrel of Monkeys.

604
00:29:57.712 --> 00:30:00.298
I love the line,
"We need more monkeys."

605
00:30:00.382 --> 00:30:04.469
I think, Ralph, that was your motto
throughout the whole production,

606
00:30:04.553 --> 00:30:08.306
trying to get more people to work.
"We need more monkeys."

607
00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:15.772
RE: This is a tribute to Bob Pauley
in a lot of ways.

608
00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:18.650
Bob and John and I kind of...
We all kind of

609
00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:22.154
have an affinity
for '50s-style architecture.

610
00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:23.780
And so we went around town

611
00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:26.158
and took a lot
of photographs of '50s-style,

612
00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:29.494
-Googie-style...
-JL: Googie-style gas stations.

613
00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:32.831
RE: Bob just had a field day
on that kind of stuff.

614
00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:36.001
NARRATOR: Supervising animator
Pete Docter.

615
00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:39.004
PD: This whole bug gag,
too, was really cool,

616
00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:40.714
because it's all this exposition.

617
00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:43.800
He's talking and talking
and you don't really need to hear it,

618
00:30:43.884 --> 00:30:46.803
and so seeing this visual bug,
the goo smeared...

619
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:49.806
JL: I remember it's one of those things
that I had to fight,

620
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:55.478
-I pleaded to let us model the bug.
-PD: It wasn't in the schedule.

621
00:30:55.562 --> 00:30:56.855
JL: In fact, I think in hindsight,

622
00:30:57.439 --> 00:31:00.150
I wish we had covered him
completely with bugs.

623
00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:02.277
But that would have been a bit over.

624
00:31:04.446 --> 00:31:08.950
PD: This whole fight sequence was
a great chance to parody classic fight,

625
00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:11.077
Arnold Schwarzenegger fight scenes.

626
00:31:11.161 --> 00:31:15.498
AS: It's great, using the toy elements
for this fight.

627
00:31:15.582 --> 00:31:17.375
JL: And, in fact,
there was this one point

628
00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:20.212
when Woody is punching Buzz's face.

629
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:26.009
I feel like we had
kind of gone too far, right here.

630
00:31:26.092 --> 00:31:28.053
But when they added
the squeak sound,

631
00:31:28.136 --> 00:31:30.222
I would say,
"Okay. It's a toy again."

632
00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:31.973
RG: Yeah, it plays.

633
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.934
NARRATOR: Producer Bonnie Arnold.

634
00:31:34.017 --> 00:31:36.561
BA: This is actually
my favorite scene in the movie.

635
00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:38.396
It's the most beautiful scene...

636
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.815
I remember the first time
I saw it rendered

637
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:42.901
with the stars and the moon.

638
00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:45.904
NARRATOR: Co-writer
Andrew Stanton.

639
00:31:45.987 --> 00:31:48.490
AS: When the car pulls away,
that emotional point

640
00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.242
is really the figurehead moment

641
00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:53.411
that really started
the whole idea of Toy Story.

642
00:31:53.495 --> 00:31:57.123
We had this image
of a toy being left behind,

643
00:31:57.207 --> 00:31:59.292
seeing its owner drive off, thinking,

644
00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:02.963
what if a toy was looking for you
as hard as you were looking for it?

645
00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:07.717
NARRATOR: Producer
Ralph Guggenheim.

646
00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:09.928
RG: One thing about the way
the story evolved

647
00:32:10.011 --> 00:32:13.515
is the way that we were able to pack in

648
00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:17.185
a number of different developments
in the story all into one scene.

649
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:19.854
This is a scene
when Buzz and Woody get separated,

650
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:22.857
but it's also the scene
in which Woody confronts Buzz

651
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:26.945
with the fact that he's a toy,
and we set up the enmity between them

652
00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:29.322
that is essential for any buddy picture.

653
00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:33.201
AS: This scene under the truck
was probably

654
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:37.747
the most hammered sequence
from a writing standpoint.

655
00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:39.416
We always knew what we wanted.

656
00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:41.710
We wanted them to have

657
00:32:41.835 --> 00:32:44.045
such strong opinions
and anger at each other,

658
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:46.631
but neither of them
saw the world the same way.

659
00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:48.425
And we feel that, now,

660
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:51.469
how it is, is exactly how we want
you as the audience to feel,

661
00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:54.931
but it took us so many passes
to finally get that across.

662
00:32:55.015 --> 00:32:59.019
JL: I'm very proud of this, more
so than any other scene in the film.

663
00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:00.854
In this sequence,

664
00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:04.816
you have the wonderful opportunity
where each character looks at the other

665
00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:07.569
and says,
"You are the craziest person

666
00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:09.863
" have ever met in my life."

667
00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:11.072
And as the audience member,

668
00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:13.658
you know exactly where
they're coming from.

669
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:18.663
BA: "You are a toy!" I love that.

670
00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:22.250
Actually, that was my idea
for using as a title of the film

671
00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.085
when we weren't sure what it would be.

672
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:27.547
I thought You Are a Toy
might make a good title.

673
00:33:28.923 --> 00:33:32.510
JL: A lot of people don't get that.
RG: The Star Trek salute.

674
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:35.013
BA: "Good riddance, you loony."
I love that.

675
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:38.558
It's so Tom Hanks, too,
or Woody as I should say.

676
00:33:38.975 --> 00:33:40.393
RE: The Pizza Planet truck.

677
00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:44.105
It's everybody's worst nightmare,
a pizza driver.

678
00:33:44.773 --> 00:33:48.276
He's got the half hour or it's free.
You know?

679
00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:51.946
And this guy, he's a heavy metal dude,

680
00:33:52.072 --> 00:33:54.240
and you can see that he doesn't really

681
00:33:54.324 --> 00:33:56.159
take care of this truck very well.

682
00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:59.204
-And he drives like a maniac.
-JL: It's very unsanitary, too.

683
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:02.457
RE: I mean, would you buy a pizza
from this guy? Unbelievable.

684
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:07.629
Look at all the rust.
There's lots of detail put on this truck.

685
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:12.884
JL: And here is again, Glenn McQueen.

686
00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:15.929
He does this fantastic scene
of Woody here.

687
00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:21.393
This grin at the end just kills me.

688
00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:23.103
Right there.

689
00:34:23.186 --> 00:34:25.772
Gets me every time.
That was completely unexpected.

690
00:34:25.855 --> 00:34:29.692
I remember in dailies when it happened
we were all howling with laughter.

691
00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:32.904
AS: It's what you always love
from the artists,

692
00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:35.448
that you can pass them off a great idea

693
00:34:35.532 --> 00:34:38.910
that you already like and then
they have plussed it all even more so.

694
00:34:38.993 --> 00:34:42.288
It feeds everybody else and if you
can get that across the board,

695
00:34:42.372 --> 00:34:45.750
it's just such a luxury to have
when you're making a picture.

696
00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:49.462
JL: This scene, when Woody climbs
into the back of the Pizza Planet truck,

697
00:34:49.546 --> 00:34:51.798
was a much longer scene.

698
00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:54.759
It had this comedy
where he is just getting beat up

699
00:34:54.843 --> 00:34:57.762
by this tool chest.

700
00:34:58.304 --> 00:35:00.849
In fact, we have some hilarious,
very early stuff

701
00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.350
that Tom Hanks did for us.

702
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:06.438
Some very funny sort of stuff
where he's getting all...

703
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:09.816
He starts calling this tool box “El Rojo."

704
00:35:13.278 --> 00:35:16.364
AS: Now we come to Pizza Planet
which, for the longest time,

705
00:35:16.448 --> 00:35:17.991
was Pizza Putt.

706
00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:20.577
JL: That's right...
It was a miniature golf course,

707
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.621
pizza parlor/miniature
golf course, and it's...

708
00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:25.957
AS: It's almost embarrassing
because we...

709
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.042
It seems so obvious now that we...

710
00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:31.629
This was something to delude Buzz
to think that he's getting home.

711
00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:33.548
And it has all the space themes,

712
00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:37.177
but for two or three years,
it did not exist.

713
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.972
And at the last minute,
we're, like, "Wait a minute...

714
00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:44.142
"A space-themed pizza restaurant."

715
00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:48.938
RE: If you look at the two
sentry guards at the front gate,

716
00:35:49.022 --> 00:35:51.065
we've got little lights in their eyes

717
00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:54.152
-like in...
-JL. Cylons in Battlestar Galactica.

718
00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:59.491
-The staffs have got a slice of pizza.
-RG: And a pepperoni shield.

719
00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:00.825
That's one of the most elaborate sets,

720
00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:03.036
given the short amount of time
that we spend here.

721
00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:06.206
AS: And it was so great
that it was coming from Disney

722
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:09.167
as a movie,
because it's such their stuff.

723
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.670
JL: My goal was to make it so
every kid wanted to go to Pizza Planet.

724
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:15.590
AS: They've got to make this place.
JL: They've got to build it.

725
00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.842
It's just too cool.

726
00:36:17.926 --> 00:36:19.594
RE: I would wanna eat there.

727
00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:23.348
RG: And here's the killer shot.
PD: Poor Rex Grignon

728
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.892
had to animate this shot
with more humans than...

729
00:36:25.975 --> 00:36:28.937
JL: Seventeen humans?
PD: And they're very complex models.

730
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.813
AS: He's dead now.

731
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:32.857
JL: He's still working
on the shot, in fact.

732
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:35.276
-He'll be done next week.
-PD: He finished quickly.

733
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.153
JL: Whack A Alien!

734
00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:41.866
I mean, with Whack A Alien,
it was an homage to Alien.

735
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.035
What cracked me up
IS SO many people say,

736
00:36:44.118 --> 00:36:47.539
"Why doesn't it say, 'Whack An Alien'?"

737
00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.332
PD: If you look at the people,

738
00:36:49.415 --> 00:36:52.335
notice that they all
resemble Andy somewhat similarly.

739
00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:54.879
JL: Andy and Mom and Molly.

740
00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:57.423
RG: With different hairstyles
and skin color.

741
00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:01.636
JL: One of the things
that we do every now and then

742
00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:03.680
is we have what we call
"Gag Sessions."

743
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.642
What we tend to do is get some people
who we think are really funny...

744
00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:09.978
AS: Fresh meat.

745
00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:15.066
JL: And come in to help
sort of stir some ideas.

746
00:37:15.149 --> 00:37:18.987
Probably the crowning achievement
of that meeting

747
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.991
was we had this idea that they
would get caught in a crane game.

748
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:26.953
And it was shaped like a spaceship
and Buzz would perceive this

749
00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:28.788
as a way to get home,

750
00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:31.541
and it's a way that
they get caught by Sid.

751
00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:34.168
We said, "What's in this?"
We originally had

752
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:37.297
little plastic pizza slices
with sunglasses on.

753
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.466
PD: A takeoff of all the
stupid logo characters that exist.

754
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.594
JL: And we were contemplating it,

755
00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:44.429
and then it was Gary Trousdale,

756
00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:47.265
the director at Disney
of Beauty and the Beast

757
00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:50.184
and Hunchback of Notre Dame,
he all of a sudden said,

758
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.145
"Buzz would say, 'Who's your leader?'

759
00:37:52.228 --> 00:37:55.023
"And they naturally
would say, "The claw."

760
00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:56.941
AS: And then the room exploded.

761
00:37:57.025 --> 00:38:00.903
JL: We were howling with laughter
and we immediately realized,

762
00:38:01.362 --> 00:38:03.656
"Well, yes. If you're a toy
and you're alive

763
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.868
"and your life is only
in this glass box..."

764
00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:09.287
And occasionally this claw
would come down

765
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.247
and take one of you away.

766
00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:13.166
Soon you would start worshiping that.

767
00:38:13.249 --> 00:38:15.835
AS: That's why it's so funny,
'cause it makes sense.

768
00:38:15.918 --> 00:38:18.713
BA: It was our actors on helium
to be the Martians.

769
00:38:18.838 --> 00:38:20.965
RG: Inhaling lots of helium
and reading lines.

770
00:38:21.049 --> 00:38:24.218
BA: To be honest, it ended up
mostly Jeff Pidgeon.

771
00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.304
PD: It cracks me up.
AS: I loved being in a theater

772
00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:29.098
when this scene came
because people would go,

773
00:38:29.182 --> 00:38:30.933
"I can't believe what I'm seeing

774
00:38:31.017 --> 00:38:32.894
"and I'm having so much fun seeing it!"

775
00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.604
And you're just, like, "Yeah!"

776
00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:37.482
It became this running theme

777
00:38:37.565 --> 00:38:40.568
to constantly touch on every
science fiction icon we could

778
00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:42.612
with Buzz Light year.
Close Encounters.

779
00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:44.072
JL: Them all wanting to touch him.

780
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:48.076
The other homage to Close Encounters
is when they point to the claw,

781
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.662
like when they asked
"Where did the sound come from?"

782
00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.497
AS: In India, right.

783
00:38:53.206 --> 00:38:57.168
JL: The tension of this is actually...
Really, it's very funny,

784
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:58.795
-but it's also very tense.
-PD: Yeah.

785
00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:02.965
JL: And it's also completely
unrealistic that the crane...

786
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:05.009
AS: That a crane can really hang on.

787
00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:08.012
JL: But we said, "We don't care."
It's the movies!

788
00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:09.597
Someone asked me that. I said,

789
00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:13.059
"This is an animated movie,
we can do whatever we want."

790
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:19.607
But we really tried to be as
realistically physically as we could...

791
00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:22.235
RG: And a great transition here
that sets up their new predicament.

792
00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:24.153
JL: It's one of my favorite transitions.

793
00:39:24.237 --> 00:39:26.072
PD: It's very subtle, isn't it?
JL: This house is evil!

794
00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:29.117
JL: This house is evil!

795
00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:34.997
RE: This is the first opportunity
we get to see Buzz's glow-in-the-dark.

796
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:37.542
Very clearly, the green on him,

797
00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:39.419
it was really lots of fun.

798
00:39:39.502 --> 00:39:42.547
AS: I had fun adding...
I wrote that line of him saying,

799
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.424
"Would you be quiet?"
What I loved about it

800
00:39:44.507 --> 00:39:47.051
was it gave you
the sense that this alien

801
00:39:47.135 --> 00:39:50.471
had been jabbering
the entire ride from Pizza Planet.

802
00:39:50.555 --> 00:39:51.889
JL: He was so excited,

803
00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:54.517
'cause he's getting closer to nirvana.

804
00:39:55.143 --> 00:39:56.978
Lee Unkrich, our editor,

805
00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:59.689
said a friend of his used to set...

806
00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:02.900
Get his dog to sit down
and set dog treats on his nose,

807
00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:05.027
and sit there with this treat on his nose

808
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:07.196
until he said,
"Okay, you can eat it."

809
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.198
And I said, "That's the way

810
00:40:09.282 --> 00:40:12.535
"Sid's gotta feed Scud the little alien."

811
00:40:13.327 --> 00:40:14.287
RE: And we get into Sid's house,

812
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:17.331
which is avocado green
and harvest gold.

813
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.003
JL: It was your mission!
RG: Two of your favorite colors.

814
00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:25.506
RE: Definitely. It was like,
early '70s Home and Garden.

815
00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.343
We found some great magazines from
that period that we really played up on.

816
00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:33.598
We get to Sid's house,
it's supposed to be evil and dark.

817
00:40:33.681 --> 00:40:36.517
And we wanted to have fun with it, too.

818
00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.728
The actual dark place is Sid's room.

819
00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:42.440
The house itself,
we had to kind of back off on

820
00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:45.777
and just say, "It's ugly
and you wouldn't want to live there,"

821
00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.237
but Sid's room is really
the darkest place.

822
00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:51.491
JL: It's a tribute to bad taste.
RE: A tribute to bad taste is right.

823
00:40:53.993 --> 00:40:56.162
JL: A lot of people think
Sid is so horrible,

824
00:40:56.245 --> 00:40:59.207
but he is the most
creative character in the film.

825
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.000
AS: He's not evil,
he's just misunderstood.

826
00:41:01.083 --> 00:41:02.210
RE: That's right.

827
00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:06.798
JL: Every time you see him,
he is play-acting, really creatively.

828
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:08.800
RG: No different than Andy.

829
00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:11.469
AS: Maybe it's defensive
'cause it's what I was like as a kid,

830
00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:14.764
but I think that Sid's more true...

831
00:41:14.847 --> 00:41:17.308
Sid had more imagination
than anybody.

832
00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:19.644
Everything he's doing,
he's play-acting,

833
00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:22.563
and I think that's how most
kids act with their toys.

834
00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:29.821
JL: Sid's room really represented
the absolute opposite,

835
00:41:29.904 --> 00:41:33.574
in every way, of Andy's room.

836
00:41:33.658 --> 00:41:37.745
We wanted Andy's room
to be light and friendly and airy

837
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:40.623
and the toys are well taken care of.

838
00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:44.836
In Sid's room, it's always dark,
no matter what time of day.

839
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:47.421
Everything is trashed,
and all of his toys

840
00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:50.967
are just really treated badly.

841
00:41:51.092 --> 00:41:53.094
And so, to manifest that,

842
00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:55.513
we thought that, well, this guy,

843
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:58.516
in thinking of him
as being very creative, Sid,

844
00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:01.227
he would take toys apart
to figure out how they work.

845
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.480
-Put them together different.
-AS: He's not just into destruction.

846
00:42:04.564 --> 00:42:09.277
He's into, just... A twisted sense of fun.

847
00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:14.448
JL: We wanted to give the feeling
to the audience

848
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:16.325
and to the two main characters

849
00:42:16.409 --> 00:42:19.579
that if Sid's in the room,
you're gonna die.

850
00:42:19.662 --> 00:42:21.247
Right? You're gonna die.

851
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.791
And then, when Sid's out of the room,

852
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:26.878
we have this moment of like,
"Okay, he's out of the room,

853
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:30.464
"let's find a way outta here."
Immediately we want to give the feeling,

854
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:32.633
"There's something alive in here."

855
00:42:32.717 --> 00:42:34.886
It's sort of like going camping.

856
00:42:34.969 --> 00:42:37.179
Just in the darkness you hear noises

857
00:42:37.263 --> 00:42:39.515
and, "There's something alive out there

858
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:40.975
"and I know it's gonna eat me."

859
00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:43.686
To make the main characters
completely

860
00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:44.937
uncomfortable the entire time...

861
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:48.649
PD: Even with Sid out of the room,
they're still in trouble.

862
00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:53.404
AS: And I think that
we never even considered

863
00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:56.157
any other option
than making the mutant toys mute.

864
00:43:01.162 --> 00:43:02.788
PD: Rex is still working at it.

865
00:43:02.872 --> 00:43:04.749
-Everybody else is...
-JL: I love that.

866
00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:07.793
PD: Faithful Rex.
JL: I also love the fact

867
00:43:07.877 --> 00:43:09.420
that they know the cat.

868
00:43:09.503 --> 00:43:12.590
They know this neighborhood.
Whiskers... They know.

869
00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:15.176
-"Get out of here."
-RG: Just like they know Scud.

870
00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:19.180
JL: Why doesn't Mom see a flashlight
coming out of her window?

871
00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:22.433
-She was turning...
-AS: Pay no attention to that man!

872
00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:25.436
And now the familiar scenario
we've all been in

873
00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:28.230
where you can't find something,
your mother tells you

874
00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:31.442
-"You're just not looking hard enough."
-PD: "The last place you looked?"

875
00:43:31.525 --> 00:43:33.444
How many times have we heard that?

876
00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:37.448
JL: I really like
this little moment, quiet moment,

877
00:43:37.531 --> 00:43:40.868
between Slinky and Bo.

878
00:43:40.952 --> 00:43:42.912
Two people who still believe in him.

879
00:43:44.205 --> 00:43:45.623
They kind of look
at each other, and it's really...

880
00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:49.585
AS: This transition never worked in the
story reels, but rendered it was great.

881
00:43:49.669 --> 00:43:51.295
-From night to day.
-RG: Gorgeous.

882
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:54.966
PD: Here we go, into the torture.
AS: Back into our Star Wars homage.

883
00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:57.176
JL: Star Wars homage number 458.

884
00:43:57.259 --> 00:43:59.470
Well, this is actually sort of in between

885
00:43:59.553 --> 00:44:02.473
a Star Wars homage
and that Nazi interrogator

886
00:44:02.556 --> 00:44:06.143
from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

887
00:44:06.227 --> 00:44:07.186
We were down at Disney

888
00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:10.272
and we were talking to Mike Gabriel,
one of the directors of Pocahontas.

889
00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:13.526
We were talking about all the things
we used to do with our toys,

890
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:17.321
and he said, "When I was a kid, I used
to burn things with a magnifying glass.

891
00:44:17.405 --> 00:44:22.243
"You are gonna have that in the film?"
Andrew and I said, "We are now!"

892
00:44:23.911 --> 00:44:26.622
NARRATOR: Supervising technical
director Bill Reeves.

893
00:44:26.747 --> 00:44:29.500
BR: The particle system effects
was the main tool

894
00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:32.211
used for doing all the smoke

895
00:44:32.294 --> 00:44:34.922
and the sparks. And that stuff

896
00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:37.341
was a technique
called particle systems

897
00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:41.846
where you model a lot of simple shapes
and you sort of blend...

898
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:45.808
There's a lot of them, so they
add together to create an effect.

899
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:50.312
PD: So even though Buzz is deluded,
he is in control of the situation.

900
00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:51.939
-He's a superhero.
-JL: Right.

901
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:54.358
He knows what to do in case of danger.

902
00:44:54.442 --> 00:44:57.653
AS: I was lucky that I got
to board this sequence,

903
00:44:57.737 --> 00:45:00.698
and this is where I came up with

904
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:04.035
using the karate-chop arm

905
00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:07.079
for Woody to defend himself with Buzz.

906
00:45:07.163 --> 00:45:09.206
It was such a great, fun moment to do.

907
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.584
RG: It's another great,
revealing moment about toys.

908
00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:15.046
JL: I think the best thing about it
is Buzz's line,

909
00:45:15.129 --> 00:45:17.048
"How you doing that?"

910
00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:20.342
AS: It's like playing off
this weird, illogical logic.

911
00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:24.972
JL: When I was showing this to my kids
at home in an early version,

912
00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:29.393
this is the one that my kids always
put their head under the blanket.

913
00:45:29.477 --> 00:45:33.314
One of the things that we tried to do
in these characters is show contrast.

914
00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:35.733
How Buzz would
do something in control

915
00:45:35.816 --> 00:45:38.569
and Woody would do something,
he's a wimp.

916
00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:40.613
This is one of my favorite ones,

917
00:45:40.696 --> 00:45:43.657
is a simple thing of Buzz
running across this opening.

918
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.243
He runs across and then he motions,

919
00:45:46.327 --> 00:45:47.620
like, to Woody to go on.

920
00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:51.582
And then Woody, just crawling
like a complete scaredy-cat.

921
00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:54.418
AS: It was great contrast.
BA: This is where I thought,

922
00:45:54.502 --> 00:45:58.923
"That dog sounds too much
like a tiger." But I was overruled.

923
00:45:59.006 --> 00:46:02.343
JL: I think that was some
of the T. rex breathing

924
00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:03.844
from Jurassic Park.

925
00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:07.181
PD: The scene where he opens his eye
and it dilates.

926
00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:09.850
JL: I mean, that's straight
out of Jurassic Park.

927
00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:12.770
RG: There was a controversy
over Scud's whiskers.

928
00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:15.815
But Eben Ostby,
our associate technical director,

929
00:46:15.898 --> 00:46:18.776
came in on a weekend
and created whiskers for Scud,

930
00:46:18.859 --> 00:46:22.113
and did them in record time.

931
00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:25.366
Those whiskers definitely
add to his cheerful demeanor.

932
00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:30.412
BA: This is the moment in the movie
where Buzz really realizes

933
00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:31.872
that he's a toy.

934
00:46:31.997 --> 00:46:33.874
Woody's told him
but he doesn't really realize it

935
00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:37.253
until he sees this commercial
about Buzz Light year toys,

936
00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:39.004
and they're available everywhere.

937
00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:41.507
AS: If it's not the Army Man,
I hear this sequence

938
00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.884
is probably people's favorite sequence.

939
00:46:43.968 --> 00:46:47.888
RE: When we first did it, it was very
retro because we thought that was fun.

940
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:50.516
But then we were asked by Disney
to make it more modern.

941
00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:53.936
We started looking at modern
commercials and they attack kids.

942
00:46:54.019 --> 00:46:57.481
JL: They're assaultive.
RG: So we brought in Penn Jillette.

943
00:46:57.565 --> 00:46:59.817
JL: Who can be the
most assaultive voice?

944
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.695
We got Penn Jillette,
of Penn and Teller, the magician.

945
00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:06.657
He is so loud.
And so we had him record it.

946
00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.159
RG: He was incredible.

947
00:47:08.242 --> 00:47:11.745
JL: He was so loud that they said
in the lobby of the recording studio

948
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:14.748
they could hear him
through the soundproof walls.

949
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:18.002
AS: Ralph, John and I all got to
be the male chorus with him.

950
00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:20.754
The "Buzz Light year."
Ready? One, two, three...

951
00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:22.506
JL, RG, AS: Buzz Light year!

952
00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.134
JL: There you go.
AS: It says "Made in Taiwan."

953
00:47:26.093 --> 00:47:28.929
It's like it was there all the time
but he never saw it.

954
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:32.016
JL: He never saw it.
He never realized what it was about.

955
00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:34.393
RG: And now comes
one of the songs that

956
00:47:34.476 --> 00:47:37.771
is a great example of why
Randy Newman was the perfect fit

957
00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:40.024
for writing the score
and songs in the movie.

958
00:47:40.107 --> 00:47:43.694
He can combine all of his ability
in writing great rock and roll songs

959
00:47:43.777 --> 00:47:45.279
with songs that evoke

960
00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:49.617
incredible, heartfelt
sympathy for a character.

961
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.328
AS: I love this,
it's hitting the nail on the head

962
00:47:52.411 --> 00:47:54.914
as many times as you can.
"I wanna fly."

963
00:47:54.997 --> 00:47:56.957
Okay, let's show an open window,

964
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:59.835
and let's show a bird flying!

965
00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:02.213
JL: Then Woody says...
What does Woody say?

966
00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:04.131
AS: "You're a toy. You can't fly!"

967
00:48:04.215 --> 00:48:05.758
Now let's have an airplane go by.

968
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:08.260
Now let's have a balloon go past, it's...

969
00:48:10.679 --> 00:48:13.182
-Get it? Symbolism!
-RG: Here comes the Hindenburg!

970
00:48:13.265 --> 00:48:15.643
JL: And you're a little guy in the world.

971
00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:19.146
RG: I love those traction boots
he's got on.

972
00:48:19.355 --> 00:48:21.398
-He climbs really well.
-AS: Translucent wings.

973
00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:24.276
PD: He's a superhero.
JL: Actually, in that shot,

974
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.362
is probably one of the few places

975
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:29.823
you could see his copyright Disney
embossed on his behind.

976
00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:32.576
AS: There it is. Right there.
Copyright Disney.

977
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.370
RE: And here is where it's just kind of

978
00:48:34.453 --> 00:48:36.580
gray-green sky, and kind of overcast.

979
00:48:36.664 --> 00:48:38.749
A little light seeping
through the clouds.

980
00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:41.585
Very subtle lighting here,

981
00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:43.837
and it's getting subtly darker
through all of this.

982
00:48:44.338 --> 00:48:46.548
RG: I was riding
on the airplane this morning,

983
00:48:46.632 --> 00:48:48.884
and a kid saw that
I had a Toy Story briefcase.

984
00:48:48.968 --> 00:48:51.303
He was like, six years old,
sitting next to me.

985
00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:54.265
He said, "I saw that.
The scene where he loses his arm,

986
00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:55.516
"that was really sad."

987
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.935
JL: There was a lot of worry
that by having...

988
00:48:58.018 --> 00:49:01.397
Dismembering one of your main
characters was going too far.

989
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.732
How're we gonna deal with this?

990
00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:05.943
So we deal with it
in the classic Pixar way,

991
00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:08.737
we started making fun of his
dismembered arm as fast as we can.

992
00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:10.781
AS: If Potato Head's not enough,

993
00:49:10.864 --> 00:49:13.284
let's have another
dismembered character.

994
00:49:16.704 --> 00:49:19.540
RG: Hannah,
in her own demented way...

995
00:49:21.709 --> 00:49:24.295
JL: Most painful scene
in the film, right?

996
00:49:24.378 --> 00:49:27.172
PD: We used to have a whole sequence
of Woody in the closet.

997
00:49:27.256 --> 00:49:30.050
JL: It's funny 'cause we had
Tom Hanks saying that normal,

998
00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:32.303
and when he saw this
in our last session,

999
00:49:32.386 --> 00:49:35.097
he goes, "Oh, wait. Back up.
I gotta do this again."

1000
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:37.683
-He kind of did it like this.
-PD: Yeah, it was very nice.

1001
00:49:37.766 --> 00:49:39.435
JL: It was really funny.

1002
00:49:39.685 --> 00:49:41.520
BA: The next scene,
the tea party scene,

1003
00:49:41.729 --> 00:49:43.647
one thing we felt wasn't working

1004
00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:46.650
was the fact that Buzz was
sort of catatonic after his fall.

1005
00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:48.902
RG: There were two things.
Buzz was catatonic,

1006
00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:52.114
and from the moment
that Buzz gets into Sid's...

1007
00:49:52.197 --> 00:49:55.284
Buzz and Woody
get into Sid's hands that

1008
00:49:55.367 --> 00:49:56.994
the movie takes a real grim turn

1009
00:49:57.077 --> 00:49:59.413
and there was no comic relief
in all of this.

1010
00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:01.707
And so, once again, our story guys,

1011
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.542
with Joe Ranft and Andrew Stanton,

1012
00:50:03.625 --> 00:50:05.794
were able to pull off masterful work

1013
00:50:05.878 --> 00:50:08.213
by combining both a comic moment

1014
00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:11.091
and something that reveals a lot
about Buzz's character,

1015
00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:13.302
and his situation here.

1016
00:50:14.053 --> 00:50:17.848
JL: It's actually one of
the best performances, too,

1017
00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:20.684
of the whole character Tim Allen did.

1018
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.771
It was one of the last things
we did with him and it was so funny,

1019
00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:26.857
'cause he tried it
as sort of demented and stuff,

1020
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.609
and finally we said,

1021
00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:31.695
"You're just drunk.
You're drunk on tea."

1022
00:50:31.779 --> 00:50:34.365
And he did this hilarious performance.

1023
00:50:34.448 --> 00:50:37.284
AS: Woody slaps Buzz, if you notice,
with his own hand.

1024
00:50:37.368 --> 00:50:39.536
Which was inspired from Commando.

1025
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.872
JL: "The Arnold Schwarzenegger Story."

1026
00:50:41.955 --> 00:50:45.042
AS: We heard this story in Commando
where he's hidden in a shed

1027
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:49.129
and this whole army of South
Americans is gonna attack him.

1028
00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:51.715
He cuts off this guy's arm
with a machete,

1029
00:50:51.799 --> 00:50:53.842
and he asked the director if he could...

1030
00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:56.178
"How about in the next take
I pick up his arm

1031
00:50:56.261 --> 00:50:58.722
"and I smash him with his own fist?"

1032
00:50:58.806 --> 00:51:00.974
The director,
I think was McTiernan, said,

1033
00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:03.060
"I think that's going a little too far."

1034
00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:07.439
And I just remembered that we were
doing this, like, "Yeah, we can do it!"

1035
00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:13.070
PD: This Battleship sequence, I think,
shows what the toys do

1036
00:51:13.153 --> 00:51:15.572
when they're waiting
for something to happen.

1037
00:51:15.656 --> 00:51:18.951
JL: You know, what I like about it
is it's strip Battleship.

1038
00:51:19.034 --> 00:51:20.285
RG: That's right.

1039
00:51:20.369 --> 00:51:23.080
JL: He wants the nose.
RG: I want the nose. Gimme the nose.

1040
00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:25.416
JL: He's already wearing the hat.

1041
00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:26.792
AS: But look how bad a player...

1042
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.502
JL: So if you really look at it,

1043
00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:31.088
he's covered the board with hits

1044
00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:33.590
and just little squares
where the boats are.

1045
00:51:33.674 --> 00:51:36.468
AS: He's that stupid.

1046
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:40.139
JL: And he grouped
all of his ships together

1047
00:51:40.222 --> 00:51:42.099
in exactly the same spot.

1048
00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:45.769
PD: So if you hit one,
you get all of them.

1049
00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:50.190
JL: The purpose of this scene
was to just show

1050
00:51:50.274 --> 00:51:52.609
kind of the desperation of Woody.

1051
00:51:52.693 --> 00:51:55.237
It starts out with such...
It's such a good idea.

1052
00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.699
He is really...
He's gonna get saved, this is great.

1053
00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:00.409
And as the scene goes on,

1054
00:52:00.492 --> 00:52:02.536
no one will help him and it gets worse.

1055
00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:05.164
And so he starts out at one level

1056
00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:07.624
and ends it much worse off.

1057
00:52:07.708 --> 00:52:09.501
It's the thing we've looked at.

1058
00:52:09.585 --> 00:52:12.379
Every scene in Toy Story,

1059
00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:15.757
we always try to have the
beginning and end be opposite,

1060
00:52:15.841 --> 00:52:19.720
where he starts out in a good position,
ends in a bad position or vice-versa.

1061
00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:23.765
We found that Tom Hanks
is really good with props.

1062
00:52:23.849 --> 00:52:28.479
Because I brought
to this recording session

1063
00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:31.607
a fake severed arm
that my teenage son has,

1064
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.443
that we used to close in car doors
and stuff like that.

1065
00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:36.862
I brought it to the session
and gave it to Tom,

1066
00:52:36.945 --> 00:52:38.363
and I said, "Just ad-lib."

1067
00:52:38.447 --> 00:52:41.742
I explained the scene, "You're doing
a puppet show with Buzz's arm

1068
00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.785
"to convince the toys Buzz is alive."

1069
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:47.664
And he took off
and he did the funniest routine.

1070
00:52:47.748 --> 00:52:49.708
Just one ad-lib after another.

1071
00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:53.045
He did where he's reading Buzz's palm.

1072
00:52:53.128 --> 00:52:55.881
He has Buzz giving him a back rub.

1073
00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:59.510
"Oh, Buzz. Yeah, a little lower."

1074
00:52:59.593 --> 00:53:02.846
PD: "Magic fingers."
JL: "Buzz, you've got magic fingers."

1075
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.141
And it was so hilarious,
and a lot of this was used,

1076
00:53:06.225 --> 00:53:07.976
like the best friend handshake.

1077
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.270
AS: But we put him through
a lot of props.

1078
00:53:10.354 --> 00:53:13.607
He had to put his face in a pillow
when he was shoved in the bed.

1079
00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:16.902
He had to wear a bonnet for some
scene that we don't have anymore.

1080
00:53:16.985 --> 00:53:19.029
RG: That was the scene
that never made it in.

1081
00:53:19.112 --> 00:53:22.866
JL: Well, because of this scene
we realized he was so good at props,

1082
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.369
that from then on,
anytime he had something,

1083
00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:27.955
we had these props for him
and he was great!

1084
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:31.250
When they find out
that Woody has a severed arm,

1085
00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:34.711
I think the moment is so touching
for me because of Slinky.

1086
00:53:34.795 --> 00:53:37.047
The dog's had so much faith in Woody.

1087
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:39.216
He's held out and believed him,

1088
00:53:39.299 --> 00:53:41.176
and here is proof positive.

1089
00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:42.928
And the expression is so great,

1090
00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:46.139
and the fact that
he just simply closes the blinds

1091
00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:49.977
is a wonderful thing here.
It's really emotional.

1092
00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:53.188
RG: Even this shot
with the clouds over the house.

1093
00:53:53.272 --> 00:53:56.984
JL: That's a painting and the movement
was created by morphing.

1094
00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:03.156
And then now, the mutant toys
are eating him alive.

1095
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.909
That's what we really wanted
to give the feeling of,

1096
00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:07.953
Woody and the audience,

1097
00:54:08.036 --> 00:54:10.998
that they're just feeding on him
and he's still alive.

1098
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:14.876
But Woody's doing something selfless
for the first time.

1099
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.462
AS: Instinctually
he's going to help Buzz.

1100
00:54:17.546 --> 00:54:20.841
RG: Well, because Woody's in a place
now where all his options are exhausted.

1101
00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:24.344
JL: Right. Buzz is all he's got.
RG: That's right.

1102
00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:27.848
JL: It's this wonderful moment
when you find out they fixed him

1103
00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:29.641
and then you see the other toys.

1104
00:54:29.725 --> 00:54:32.352
AS: With the audience,
you watch them do the same thing.

1105
00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:34.438
JL: Then they go back
in their mind and say,

1106
00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:37.566
"Wait a minute,
all along these characters were good.

1107
00:54:37.649 --> 00:54:38.650
"They're selfless."

1108
00:54:38.734 --> 00:54:42.446
And you look back to
when you thought they were cannibals,

1109
00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:45.115
and they're simply
taking the parts of the toys

1110
00:54:45.198 --> 00:54:47.576
as quickly as they can
out of the way of Sid.

1111
00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:48.660
AS: And when they block the doorway

1112
00:54:48.744 --> 00:54:50.621
they were trying
to warn him about Scud.

1113
00:54:50.704 --> 00:54:52.914
You start reading all that
in a different way.

1114
00:54:52.998 --> 00:54:54.958
JL: So it's all this double entendre,

1115
00:54:55.042 --> 00:54:59.379
double purposes for everything
that the mutant toys have done.

1116
00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:01.173
RG: Then it's business as usual,

1117
00:55:01.256 --> 00:55:03.467
"cause Sid is coming back
up to the room.

1118
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:06.595
AS: We used to get a lot of weird
logic police people going,

1119
00:55:06.678 --> 00:55:08.930
"It's like 5:00 or 6:00.

1120
00:55:09.056 --> 00:55:11.892
"How did he get this box so late
from the postal service?

1121
00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:14.227
"Who delivers packages that late?"

1122
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:17.230
JL: We're like, "I don't think
people will notice."

1123
00:55:17.397 --> 00:55:19.024
PD: He just got home.

1124
00:55:19.274 --> 00:55:22.653
RE: I love this
Fat Cow Farms milk crate

1125
00:55:22.736 --> 00:55:26.406
that Sid stole from the back of Safeway.

1126
00:55:27.574 --> 00:55:28.867
And somewhere stamped on it, it says,

1127
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:32.120
"You will be punished to the
maximum extent if you steal this."

1128
00:55:32.204 --> 00:55:35.290
And, of course,
Sid had no qualms with that.

1129
00:55:35.374 --> 00:55:38.335
JL: One of the reasons
that we did this convoluted thing

1130
00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:40.671
of getting Woody in that milk crate

1131
00:55:40.754 --> 00:55:42.547
is for having him trapped in it.

1132
00:55:42.631 --> 00:55:45.801
And then the convoluted thing
of Sid taking the toolbox

1133
00:55:45.884 --> 00:55:48.595
and lifting it all the way
on top of the milk crate

1134
00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:49.846
to get the tape out.

1135
00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:53.725
Right? I mean, no one ever notices it,
but it was done just so...

1136
00:55:53.892 --> 00:55:55.435
So Woody would be trapped.

1137
00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.772
RE: The rain effect is one of those
shots that looks very simple

1138
00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.440
but was very hard to do.

1139
00:56:00.524 --> 00:56:03.527
BR: The lead technical person
on the rain was Tom Porter.

1140
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:07.197
This is a particle system shot
that was used in a couple other places,

1141
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.701
but in particular here. The rain
on the window was a challenge.

1142
00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:13.161
-And then we watched...
-JL: In Cold Blood.

1143
00:56:13.245 --> 00:56:16.790
BR: In Cold Blood was the movie
we used as the lead-in to this,

1144
00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:19.292
or our conceptual thing.
We watched that a lot

1145
00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:21.753
and got some really
great ideas from there.

1146
00:56:21.837 --> 00:56:23.714
Inspiration kinds of stuff

1147
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:26.299
to make this be very moody.

1148
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.677
JL: Karen Kiser,

1149
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.221
she has two sons,

1150
00:56:31.304 --> 00:56:34.182
and she's such a great mom.

1151
00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:36.101
She did a great job with this scene

1152
00:56:36.184 --> 00:56:38.895
'cause there's a real sensitive quality

1153
00:56:38.979 --> 00:56:42.274
to the animation
of both Andy and the mom.

1154
00:56:42.357 --> 00:56:45.861
AS: It's just computer animation.
JL: What?

1155
00:56:45.944 --> 00:56:48.447
PD: It's not real?
JL: This is with computers?

1156
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:51.408
I just love, so much, Rex.

1157
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:55.746
It's like,
he's so nervous about traveling.

1158
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:58.915
And then the fact that
these two guys are stuck together.

1159
00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:00.459
"No one else would pick me!"

1160
00:57:00.542 --> 00:57:02.043
PD: It's also a great set up,

1161
00:57:02.127 --> 00:57:05.088
or a contrast
to the scene coming up next.

1162
00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:07.174
Where it's a little bit of light comedy

1163
00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:09.176
and then we go into the serious stuff.

1164
00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:18.602
NARRATOR: Producer
Ralph Guggenheim.

1165
00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:20.937
RG: This is probably
the most heart-felt scene

1166
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:22.439
between Buzz and Woody,

1167
00:57:22.522 --> 00:57:24.649
the scene where Woody
reveals how important

1168
00:57:24.733 --> 00:57:27.068
he understands Buzz is.

1169
00:57:27.319 --> 00:57:30.197
And he does it out of desperation
to try and get Buzz

1170
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.117
to get out of this state
of depression he's in.

1171
00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:36.661
And at the same time, it tells us exactly

1172
00:57:36.745 --> 00:57:39.039
what the rules of the world are here,

1173
00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:42.125
as seen by Woody
through his experienced eyes.

1174
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:44.628
NARRATOR: Director John Lasseter.

1175
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:49.090
JL: I'm so proud of this scene
because it's extremely

1176
00:57:49.174 --> 00:57:52.719
kind of complex as far as having
a minimal amount of words

1177
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:56.097
and trying to get a lot of meaning.
And there's so much said

1178
00:57:56.181 --> 00:57:59.267
in the subtlety, the facial acting,

1179
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:00.644
as well as the words.

1180
00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:03.271
And also by keeping Woody

1181
00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:05.816
sort of behind these bars

1182
00:58:05.899 --> 00:58:08.610
and having to make it
SO you can see his eyes

1183
00:58:08.693 --> 00:58:11.071
through the one opening there,

1184
00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:13.573
it really kind of contained him
and so it really

1185
00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:17.327
helped keep the acting
real subtle and minimal.

1186
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:21.331
PD: This is the stuff you dream about
as an animator.

1187
00:58:21.414 --> 00:58:23.416
JL: The hardest stuff!
AS: Meaty subtext.

1188
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:27.170
JL: Everybody thinks the big wild stuff
would be hard, but this is hard.

1189
00:58:28.255 --> 00:58:30.924
NARRATOR: Supervising animator
Pete Docter.

1190
00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:33.051
PD: This scene has a great arc,

1191
00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:35.929
where Woody starts
intense and excited,

1192
00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.347
and goes downhill,

1193
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:39.975
and Buzz starts way down
and works his way up.

1194
00:58:40.058 --> 00:58:42.227
We actually animated
quite a bit of stuff

1195
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:45.272
that was cut out of this sequence.

1196
00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:48.608
We started with
five pages of stuff and cut.

1197
00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:51.027
It works better,
although at the time I was like,

1198
00:58:51.111 --> 00:58:52.529
"No, you can't cut it!"

1199
00:58:52.612 --> 00:58:55.073
JL: Plus, those were your scenes
that were cut.

1200
00:58:55.907 --> 00:58:57.242
NARRATOR: Producer Bonnie Arnold.

1201
00:58:57.325 --> 00:59:00.120
BA: I find it amazing
that you would not think

1202
00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:03.290
that none of the actors recorded
their dialogue together.

1203
00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:05.208
The picture editors, dialogue editors

1204
00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:07.878
did such a great job
of cutting dialogue together

1205
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:11.840
that you would think they were
all acting in the same room together.

1206
00:59:13.466 --> 00:59:17.470
JL: The lamest pull-string line.
AS: I know.

1207
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:22.309
PD: That moment is great because
you've got this heart-felt emotional stuff,

1208
00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.227
but people laugh at that line.

1209
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:27.439
-But they still feel the emotion.
-AS: Well, 'cause it's painful.

1210
00:59:27.522 --> 00:59:29.608
-"I'm just a loser."
-RG: You need that relief

1211
00:59:29.858 --> 00:59:32.152
in the midst of a scene like this.

1212
00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:34.237
NARRATOR: Co-writer
Andrew Stanton.

1213
00:59:34.321 --> 00:59:36.323
AS: This is where
all these things paid off

1214
00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:38.742
that we were putting in
just for touches at the beginning.

1215
00:59:38.825 --> 00:59:42.329
Looking at Andy's name under the shoe
and the "Made in Taiwan."

1216
00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:46.541
It really just helped sell
a lot of emotional hits.

1217
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.169
NARRATOR: Art director
Ralph Eggleston.

1218
00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.880
RE: Throughout this entire
sequence the sun is rising.

1219
00:59:51.963 --> 00:59:55.592
You kind of see a very subtle
change from these somber blues,

1220
00:59:55.675 --> 00:59:58.762
and when they realize
that they really need each other,

1221
00:59:58.845 --> 01:00:01.306
not only to escape,
but to get back to Andy,

1222
01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:03.099
the sun really breaks through,

1223
01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.644
and they bond together
and begin their escape.

1224
01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:09.689
JL: The detail is incredible.
I mean, you feel it.

1225
01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.775
RE: You know it's there.

1226
01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.069
A lot of times, you'd think that,

1227
01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:16.112
"All this work we did, let's show it off.

1228
01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:18.782
"Let's put lights back there."
When, no, it's not important.

1229
01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.952
PD: There's so much detail
of just junk all over the desk.

1230
01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.536
JL: It was all modeled.

1231
01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.706
RE: Eggman Movers.

1232
01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:30.085
JL: The Eggman was
Ralph Eggleston's log-in.

1233
01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:33.129
-So that's why the moving...
-PD: Now here comes the big cheat.

1234
01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:35.715
Where Buzz is straight now
and they keep going.

1235
01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:38.134
JL: They're about three feet
from the wall,

1236
01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:39.803
but Buzz is still pushing.

1237
01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.721
AS: From off the wall.
PD: Go, Buzz!

1238
01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:43.473
JL: You can do it! It's a movie!

1239
01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:45.725
RG: The hyper-extended version
of Buzz.

1240
01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:48.061
PD: Nobody notices. Hopefully.

1241
01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:50.981
AS: Another payback to all bullies.

1242
01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.941
Me?

1243
01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:56.152
I'm hoping they're all
dreaming about ponies.

1244
01:00:56.277 --> 01:00:58.863
JL: He is a little kid.
That's what I like about it,

1245
01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:01.074
he's still just a little kid.

1246
01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:05.829
RG: Is that a can
of Doctor Catmull's Root Beer?

1247
01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:09.874
PD: Yeah. There's so much detail
of just junk all over the desk.

1248
01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.501
JL: It was all modeled.

1249
01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:13.712
Ed Catmull's head of Pixar.

1250
01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:16.756
Doctor Catmull's
Old-Fashioned Root Beer.

1251
01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:22.137
Well, it's really at this point
that Woody is starting,

1252
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.597
you know, they've bonded now.

1253
01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.433
Buzz and Woody. You start seeing

1254
01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:30.478
that all the forces around them
are keeping them apart.

1255
01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:33.023
AS: The minute Woody wants...
They join together,

1256
01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.233
everything pulls them apart.

1257
01:01:35.316 --> 01:01:38.862
JL: And right there he's saying
he's relying on Buzz.

1258
01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.656
It's like...
That's right, we had a line once.

1259
01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:43.992
He said,
"What would Buzz do?

1260
01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:46.327
"He'd say something stupid.
Not an option!"

1261
01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:49.164
PD: "Not a plan. He'd say something!"

1262
01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:50.832
That's where he gets the idea.

1263
01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:54.753
AS: But we felt like that projected
too specifically what he was gonna do.

1264
01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:58.840
JL: And he honestly asks for help here,
which is great.

1265
01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:00.550
I love this scene.

1266
01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.010
Angie Glock a animated that.

1267
01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:05.013
PD: Yeah, it's all emotion.
Again, there's no facial change.

1268
01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:06.514
It's just the timing.

1269
01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:09.434
AS: But you read that same expression
differently now.

1270
01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:13.313
PD: It's a different attitude...
RG: Bob Gordon gave us Morse code.

1271
01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:16.316
JL: For those who
know Morse code, it actually...

1272
01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:18.276
PD: You can figure it out. Don't tell.

1273
01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:23.531
AS: Gotta work if you wanna know.
RG: Look up your code dictionary.

1274
01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.786
JL: The scene where we cut to Andy

1275
01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:30.455
in his room completely empty,

1276
01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:34.417
to me, is one of the most
emotional scenes in the film.

1277
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.628
You see the box
that says "Andy's Toys,"

1278
01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:38.421
and to me, I always remembered,

1279
01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.131
when you move, this was your life.

1280
01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:42.008
He lived all his life in this room.

1281
01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:43.885
And to see it completely empty,

1282
01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:47.055
-and hoping that they...
-AS: It would uncover them.

1283
01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:49.849
JL: They're hidden and
he realizes they're not around,

1284
01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.644
and all he has left is his hat
that represents Woody

1285
01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:54.312
and the box that represents Buzz.

1286
01:02:54.395 --> 01:02:58.441
BA: This is that score moment that
I think Randy did such a good job at.

1287
01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.861
We had The Great Escape
for scratch music

1288
01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:03.530
and gave Randy an idea.

1289
01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.866
But I think Randy took that
and made it a hundred times better.

1290
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.744
But it really moves this along.

1291
01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.621
RG: And it builds.

1292
01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:13.748
And it finally hits its most

1293
01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:16.042
marching band sort of feeling

1294
01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:18.920
at the moment when they go
into the duct work of the house

1295
01:03:19.003 --> 01:03:22.048
and it's a constant build
all through here.

1296
01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:26.719
AS: Joss Whedon our script writer,
wrote these lines,

1297
01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:29.806
and when he wrote,
"Wind the frog,"

1298
01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:32.475
we loved that line so much,
we actually created a frog

1299
01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:33.977
just so that there would be a frog

1300
01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:35.645
to say, "Wind the frog!"

1301
01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:40.233
JL: We kind of did this big sort of

1302
01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.153
Rube Goldberg-ian kind of

1303
01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:46.573
plan, that's so complex.

1304
01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.408
We wanted to keep it
from the audience

1305
01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.869
so they didn't know what was going on.

1306
01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.121
And you'd come in right at the very end

1307
01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:55.165
where there's a bit of information,

1308
01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:58.293
but who knows what's
actually gonna happen.

1309
01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:02.839
And originally we had just
Roller Bob and Woody go down.

1310
01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:06.801
But then, we've grown
to like these mutant toys so much,

1311
01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.846
you wanna see them get back at Sid.

1312
01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:12.891
AS: So we had to add a layer
of how to get everybody outside.

1313
01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:17.145
JL: In the original script,
Woody asks for help.

1314
01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:19.647
One of the characters
goes out through the vent,

1315
01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:22.400
and you hear some noise,
and screeching through the door

1316
01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:24.694
comes Barbie in her pink Corvette.

1317
01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:26.237
RG: From Hannah's room.

1318
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:28.531
JL: He goes to Hannah's room
and gets Barbie.

1319
01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:31.576
And she was dressed in a prom dress
in the pink Corvette.

1320
01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:34.913
-She looked fantastic.
-AS: But she was tough as nails.

1321
01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:37.081
JL: Like Linda Hamilton
from Terminator 2.

1322
01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:39.542
She said, "Come with me
if you want to live."

1323
01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:42.879
And she drives him past the dog,
and the dog's chasing him,

1324
01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:45.006
and she drives him out to the backyard.

1325
01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:49.636
And Woody said some great line about,

1326
01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.930
"I wish I was anatomically correct."

1327
01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.393
AS: Sid's saying some funny wall a
all through this.

1328
01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.646
When you're paying attention
to the toys,

1329
01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.941
he's actually searching
for the ignition sticks.

1330
01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:06.611
"Where are the...
Wait, never mind. Here they are!"

1331
01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:12.909
JL: And we always envisioned
that Sid's dad

1332
01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:16.913
is the kind of consumer that
the big hardware stores prey on,

1333
01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:19.499
-where they get him into...
-PD: The home handyman!

1334
01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:20.917
JL: Never finishes any job,

1335
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.836
and so he started
putting in a sprinkler system...

1336
01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:27.298
PD: Years ago.
JL: And he left the trenches out.

1337
01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:29.509
AS: And everything's half-done.

1338
01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:34.430
PD: This scene was originally
to get Woody the match.

1339
01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:37.725
JL: We originally had it where he had
sprinkled matches all over him.

1340
01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:41.020
And then we realized
he can just do it with one match.

1341
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.607
JL: There are so many weeds
in this backyard.

1342
01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.901
I think there's 18,000 weeds.

1343
01:05:56.744 --> 01:06:00.373
AS: We actually, in our first pass,
had Woody come fully to life

1344
01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.626
at the last second and scare Sid.

1345
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:06.671
But we decided
it was much more interesting

1346
01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.798
to just have him use his pull-string.

1347
01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:11.050
We were starting
to use it more in the film.

1348
01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:14.053
JL: This is the thing that
always has kept him down.

1349
01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.431
This is a thing, a scratchy voice box,

1350
01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:19.726
and he uses it to defeat Sid.

1351
01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:23.313
AS: We couldn't help
but have that button.

1352
01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:26.065
Let him come to life for half a line,
So maybe Sid

1353
01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:30.653
-isn't sure he saw what he saw.
-PD: But it builds better this way.

1354
01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.158
JL: We originally wanted
to have the toys come out

1355
01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:37.035
from under the ground,

1356
01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:39.162
but it was technically complex,

1357
01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.331
so we decided to have

1358
01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.624
this trench filled with muddy water

1359
01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.586
'cause it was easier,
and have them rise out of the water,

1360
01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.839
which actually works.
And then we did this muddy shader

1361
01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:51.466
on the green army men.

1362
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.926
AS: In the story reel there were
these great shots

1363
01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.512
of arms bursting out of the ground.

1364
01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.351
PD: Those Combat Carl's are the same
model as the green army men,

1365
01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:05.104
just a little larger
with spare parts stuck on them.

1366
01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:08.608
So, Rich Quade got to animate

1367
01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:11.944
the one scene of Woody
coming to life in front of people.

1368
01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:18.201
BA: The biggest comment
from the outside world was,

1369
01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:21.037
"Was this stock footage?"

1370
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.622
"Was this a computer model?"

1371
01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:26.459
RG: No, every plant in Sid's backyard
was hand placed, every weed.

1372
01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:32.048
JL: And here's Hannah's payback.

1373
01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:35.134
It's for all the little sisters in the world.

1374
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.137
RG: That were ever tormented
by a big brother.

1375
01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:44.060
RG: Gary Rydstrom did a great job
of creating sound effects

1376
01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:46.187
for all the toys in that scene.

1377
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.231
JL: They didn't talk,
but he gave a voice.

1378
01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:52.151
RG: They're all talking to each other,
congratulating each other.

1379
01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.153
AS: The quickest goodbye in the world.

1380
01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:56.572
-"Thanks."
-PD: It wasn't there at all,

1381
01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:59.200
they just ran away,
and we thought, "Wait a minute."

1382
01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:02.203
-He's gotta say goodbye.
-AS: I didn't want it mushy.

1383
01:08:02.286 --> 01:08:06.040
JL: That line there of Buzz,
we used to have it saying,

1384
01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:07.625
"I'm stuck, come help me."

1385
01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:10.336
And then we realized
"No, he would be more giving."

1386
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.839
At this point they are
helping each other,

1387
01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.299
so he just, "Just go.
You made it. It's okay."

1388
01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:18.886
Now, they're together,
they're working together at this point.

1389
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:21.431
AS: They're, for the first time in the film,

1390
01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:23.641
where they both want the same thing.

1391
01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:26.769
-For the same reason.
-JL: And so they're working together.

1392
01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:29.647
AS: We decided once they're
working together they would

1393
01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:31.357
sacrifice for one another.

1394
01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:33.943
And each sacrifice
would empower them

1395
01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:36.279
to get over the next obstacle.

1396
01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:38.448
And then the next guy would sacrifice...

1397
01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:39.949
And it was really nice.

1398
01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:41.784
JL: Even now that they're together,

1399
01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:44.787
Buzz runs like an athlete.
He's Carl Lewis, you know?

1400
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:46.998
And Woody is a wimp.

1401
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:49.876
Look at those arms.

1402
01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:54.297
Whereas the Army Man sequence
was the first thing that we produced,

1403
01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.091
the chase sequence was the last.

1404
01:08:57.175 --> 01:09:00.178
It was that way on purpose
because we knew it would be huge.

1405
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.222
NARRATOR: Supervising technical
director Bill Reeves.

1406
01:09:03.431 --> 01:09:07.435
BR: We had to create six
city blocks of model.

1407
01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:11.189
And we used various techniques
to make that problem

1408
01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:14.233
be a little more tractable.
We designed about 20 houses.

1409
01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:16.402
Bill Cone did a lot of the design work

1410
01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:20.740
and Loren Carpenter did most of
the technical creation of that stuff.

1411
01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:25.161
And so the houses were
about 20 different varieties...

1412
01:09:25.244 --> 01:09:27.246
JL: They're very simple models.
BR: Oh, yeah.

1413
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.916
JL: It's just, like, a little box,
really, with a roof.

1414
01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.001
BR: There's texture maps
painted on them.

1415
01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:33.753
A lot of the slat work...

1416
01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:36.380
JL: All the detail is a painting.
BR: Yeah, right.

1417
01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:39.258
RE: There's 20 styles,
but we would tweak colors,

1418
01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:41.677
so then we had
40 different styles really.

1419
01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.346
Sometimes we'd turn them.

1420
01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.224
RG: I think what makes people gasp
when they see this scene

1421
01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:49.018
is the degree of dimension
as you're traveling.

1422
01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:52.605
I think that is created by the trees
and the light coming through them.

1423
01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:56.108
BR: We had about 10 or 12
different trees.

1424
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:59.320
We could make each tree, each of
those, be any different size we want.

1425
01:09:59.403 --> 01:10:01.155
And we could play with...

1426
01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:03.824
We could rotate them
and it would look different.

1427
01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.577
It was a huge challenge
to orchestrate this whole thing.

1428
01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:10.790
I wanna point out Eben Ostby
did a lot of that work, just sort of

1429
01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:14.293
laying out the world
and building a system

1430
01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:17.547
so we could mix and match
all these different parameters

1431
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:19.966
and control it.
Every shot was different.

1432
01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.968
Or every chunk of shots.

1433
01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:25.388
There were 267 shots in the chase.

1434
01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:28.182
RG: What also was a great fundamental
idea for the chase sequence

1435
01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.351
is that it was overcoming,
like the movie,

1436
01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:34.063
in this chase sequence one had to
overcome one obstacle after another.

1437
01:10:34.146 --> 01:10:35.856
Every time the stakes got higher,

1438
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.484
in terms of what it would take
to catch that van.

1439
01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:41.737
-The goal remained the same.
-AS: And the sacrifices got bigger.

1440
01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:45.241
From the day we had the treatment
and thought of this idea,

1441
01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:47.660
I was so jazzed,

1442
01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:50.871
was the miscommunication
that you've built

1443
01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:54.917
with these toys in Andy's room. That
everything Woody does to save Buzz

1444
01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:57.670
looks like something bad
that he's doing,

1445
01:10:57.753 --> 01:11:02.425
and the toys try to stop him.
I loved that ironic twist on that.

1446
01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:06.345
BA: We had a big discussion to make
sure we don't think the dog is killed.

1447
01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:10.099
RG: Have to insure
no animals were injured

1448
01:11:10.182 --> 01:11:12.435
in the course of making this movie.

1449
01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:16.272
And the other thing that's great
is the audience never tires

1450
01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:18.733
of seeing Potato Head's parts
get whacked off.

1451
01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:20.276
BA: That's great.

1452
01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.653
RG: You can smash Potato Head
as often as you want

1453
01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:24.614
and every time they love it.

1454
01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:28.367
BA: I think poor Tom Hanks
told me so many times,

1455
01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:30.328
"I feel I'm screaming through the movie,

1456
01:11:30.411 --> 01:11:33.080
are you sure it's not going to
come off like that?"

1457
01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:34.832
But it really doesn't.

1458
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.797
JL: "Turbo."
AS: Is that like the shortest shot?

1459
01:11:41.922 --> 01:11:44.383
JL: It's amazing how people
read that "Turbo,"

1460
01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.552
and it's for just a couple frames.

1461
01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:51.724
BA: Again, great technical effort
on the technical director's part,

1462
01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:55.311
plus the great effort
of our sound designer Gary Rydstrom

1463
01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:58.564
to make this chase just work
so incredibly well

1464
01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.067
with the different sounds
and noises that you hear.

1465
01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.236
JL: I was very inspired early on,
before we started this movie,

1466
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:10.159
with a Nissan 300ZX ad that
Ridley Scott did for the Super Bowl.

1467
01:12:10.242 --> 01:12:13.496
And it was so intense,
the cutting and stuff, and I said,

1468
01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:15.414
"This is what it should be about."

1469
01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:17.249
We would describe it saying,

1470
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.752
"The scale speed
of remote controlled cars

1471
01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:22.004
“"Is 70, 80 miles an hour,

1472
01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:26.008
"so imagine being on top of a car
going 70 or 80 miles an hour

1473
01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:29.512
"and trying to climb onto
a 10-story building on wheels."

1474
01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:33.224
And what I love about it
is it made Slinky so heroic.

1475
01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:36.936
It's so heroic, the more danger
that you added to it.

1476
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.651
BA: Of course the famous
"Hakuna Mat at a" cut-back.

1477
01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:47.655
JL: When we were talking to Randy
about recording something,

1478
01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:50.199
doing a piece of music
like that, he goes,

1479
01:12:50.282 --> 01:12:52.618
"No, what they'd be listening to

1480
01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.371
"is something like Lion King
or something like that."

1481
01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.210
AS: Again, with the whole
battery set-ups we've had,

1482
01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:04.588
it's great to bring it back again,
it made complete sense.

1483
01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:07.466
The batteries are dying after all this.

1484
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.636
Now, this is the point
where everybody in the theater...

1485
01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.389
Smart people said,
"They're gonna light the rocket."

1486
01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.766
JL: "I know it,
they're gonna light the rocket."

1487
01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:19.562
And we actually, originally
just had them light the rocket.

1488
01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:22.690
And it absolutely drove us crazy,

1489
01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:26.402
the predictability of I,
so we said, "Let's just play into it."

1490
01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:30.364
Let's put one match,
one rocket, one fuse and...

1491
01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:32.616
PD: And one car.

1492
01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.245
JL: And the wonderful moan
that happens in the audience...

1493
01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:37.997
AS: It was the best response.

1494
01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.333
JL: We were so excited when
we showed this for the first time.

1495
01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.002
They went nuts.

1496
01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:46.422
Because at this point in time
you would stop the movie and say,

1497
01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:49.341
"What happens next?"
And they...

1498
01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.928
And people wouldn't be able to tell.

1499
01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.514
So once this rocket goes off,

1500
01:13:55.723 --> 01:14:00.060
I wanted it to have
this massive explosion and just...

1501
01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:01.854
They're sort of out of control.

1502
01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.899
They're not sort of,
they're massively out of control.

1503
01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:07.234
We always thought about,
what would it be like

1504
01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:08.986
to be on something going this fast?

1505
01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:11.989
And we thought of
those old NASA shots,

1506
01:14:12.072 --> 01:14:15.326
of the G-forces and what
the face does with the G-forces,

1507
01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:17.536
and Doug Sweet land, the animator...

1508
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.789
And this is the one that blew us away

1509
01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:22.249
more than any other shot in the film.

1510
01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:25.461
What he did
with that Woody model in the face.

1511
01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:29.548
BR: I modeled Woody and I couldn't
believe when I saw this in dailies,

1512
01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.301
that Woody could do this.
Woody can't do this!

1513
01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:36.305
And Doug somehow found a way
to tweak that face.

1514
01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:38.808
AS: My favorite shot,
technically, in the movie

1515
01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:41.185
is this. It's so cool, it looks so real.

1516
01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:43.062
Going straight up, looking down.

1517
01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:46.315
PD: "Not today" was a callback to...

1518
01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:49.985
Originally the film opened
with a Buzz Light year cartoon.

1519
01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.029
-That was the payoff line.
-AS: Like a Bond film,

1520
01:14:52.112 --> 01:14:56.200
you came in on the climax and he
said "Not today," opened his wings

1521
01:14:56.283 --> 01:14:58.160
and got out of his predicament.

1522
01:14:58.244 --> 01:14:59.537
RG: Here's the real payoff.

1523
01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:05.584
JL: And we actually had
a different line there. Right?

1524
01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:09.088
It was animated.
It was finished and in dailies.

1525
01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.466
You said, "No, you know
what he should say is..."

1526
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:13.843
RG: "Falling with style."

1527
01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.929
AS: Which makes Buzz seem clever,
like he remembered that line

1528
01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:20.349
even though he wasn't listening
at the moment that that was said.

1529
01:15:20.432 --> 01:15:22.768
PD: And it really gets...
I think it gets people.

1530
01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:26.146
RG: I love the way
this next shot is composed,

1531
01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.357
when Andy picks them up
and grabs them.

1532
01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.694
They wink to each other,
at the right moment, so that it's not...

1533
01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:33.487
They never let on
to Andy that they're alive.

1534
01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:36.031
PD: That was a late addition as well.

1535
01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.950
AS: The wink.

1536
01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.327
RG: A marvelous piece
of music by Randy Newman...

1537
01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:43.914
AS: That's not a real set!
RG: Absolutely.

1538
01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:45.457
RE: A painting.

1539
01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:49.920
PD: Ash was frustrated with that scene.
He did a mock one of Andy

1540
01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.756
picking up the tree and hitting Mom
over the head with it.

1541
01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.260
AS: "Frankincense, this is Myrrh."

1542
01:15:56.343 --> 01:16:00.055
PD: This is a vestige of an old...
We had a karaoke gag.

1543
01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:01.807
JL: Karaoke Christmas party.

1544
01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:05.227
AS: They had a pop-up Christmas book
with a tree up,

1545
01:16:05.311 --> 01:16:07.521
and then Buzz was
actually singing karaoke

1546
01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:09.481
using Mr. Spell to read off of.

1547
01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.400
<i>PD: I The weather outside is frightful &</i>

1548
01:16:11.483 --> 01:16:14.695
AS: I don't know why that got cut
because it's actually pretty funny.

1549
01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.158
AS: I remember writing that line
in the sound booth

1550
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.036
while we had Wallace Shawn
on his last day.

1551
01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:25.789
JL: It's so great, it's completely...
The entire room has changed

1552
01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:29.251
because of the relationship
of Buzz and Woody.

1553
01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:32.671
You know, they're bonded now,
and it's a subtle thing,

1554
01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.383
that everything is...
Everybody's thinking the opposite,

1555
01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:39.678
-they're welcoming the new toys.
-AS: It's affected the whole world.

1556
01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:43.265
RG: Even the decor of the room. Isn't
it a mixture of cowboy and Western?

1557
01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:46.393
JL: It's now both.
RG: Cowboy and space design.

1558
01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.103
JL: Everything's together.

1559
01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:50.272
AS: One of our story artists, Jill Culton,

1560
01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:53.943
in passing was, when we were trying
to think of what Andy would get

1561
01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:57.279
for a final toy, she said,
sort of threw it out,

1562
01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.781
"What about a puppy?"

1563
01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:02.910
-And it was like, ding! That's right!
-JL: Yes! That's what they should get.

1564
01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:07.498
JL: When we started Toy Story,

1565
01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:08.874
I think the big goal for us

1566
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.710
was to do a character movie.

1567
01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:14.713
Was to have a film
that had a good story,

1568
01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:17.174
but characters that you could just...

1569
01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:20.386
Really memorable and you feel for
that would make you laugh.

1570
01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:23.806
To have the main characters funny,
not just the comic sidekicks.

1571
01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:26.976
But also that you really felt for
and had a lot of heart.

1572
01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:29.269
And that was a thing
we started out with.

1573
01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:32.982
I knew this film would look different
than anything anybody had seen.

1574
01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.818
But it was to just sweep them away

1575
01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:40.322
with great story and characters.
I'm really proud of that.

1576
01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:43.367
RG: Second to the story,
the other thing we were aiming for

1577
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:45.661
with this film,
knowing that we were making

1578
01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:47.913
the first computer-animated
feature film,

1579
01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:51.125
was to really set a high level of quality

1580
01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.669
consistently in terms of
how the film would look

1581
01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:56.630
and how all the elements
of music and art direction

1582
01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:59.842
and animation would all fit together

1583
01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:02.636
to make the film
as high quality as we could.

1584
01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.306
RE: I was surprised that I was asked to
work on a computer-animated feature

1585
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:09.518
when I had zero experience
in computer animation whatsoever.

1586
01:18:09.601 --> 01:18:12.229
I had to stop at the beginning
of production and say,

1587
01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:16.150
"Am I gonna learn about computers
or am I gonna concentrate on the goals

1588
01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:17.901
"that John and I agree on?"

1589
01:18:17.985 --> 01:18:21.739
And we concentrated on supporting
the story and the characters.

1590
01:18:21.822 --> 01:18:23.574
And by virtue of doing that,

1591
01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:27.202
the computer kind of downplayed itself,
through the story.

1592
01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:30.873
PD: Animation-wise it was great
to have the chance to have a story

1593
01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:33.834
with a character
with subtext and an arc.

1594
01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:36.045
And to be able to try to,

1595
01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:38.505
and this was the aim of the animation,

1596
01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:41.216
to have people forget
that this is computer animation.

1597
01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.968
That they care about the character,

1598
01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:46.555
and they're relating to this person,
a real person, to them.

1599
01:18:46.638 --> 01:18:49.391
And I think,
thanks to the great animators

1600
01:18:49.475 --> 01:18:52.102
that worked on the film
that we succeeded.

1601
01:18:52.186 --> 01:18:54.229
BR: The film was
a great opportunity for me

1602
01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.732
to work with some
amazingly talented people,

1603
01:18:56.815 --> 01:18:59.651
John, Ralph and just everybody.

1604
01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.111
To come together as a team

1605
01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.989
and to do the first
fully computer-animated film.

1606
01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:07.993
It's a culmination of many years
of personally, in my life,

1607
01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.788
and I know the other people
on the team to do this,

1608
01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:13.165
and it was...

1609
01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:16.752
I'm just so proud
of being part of the whole mix.

1610
01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:19.088
BA: What was one of
the most challenging things

1611
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:20.547
about making Toy Story,

1612
01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:25.260
was the fact that no one
had ever done this before.

1613
01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:29.389
No one had ever made a feature length
computer-animated film.

1614
01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.725
And what I think we worked hard
at trying to do

1615
01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:34.937
was getting people that
were the best at what they did.

1616
01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.481
We say that we had more PhD's
working on our film

1617
01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.942
than in any other film crew
that we knew of.

1618
01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:42.152
And I think the biggest challenges,

1619
01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:45.572
for Ralph Guggenheim
and myself as producers,

1620
01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:48.200
was to try to assemble a crew

1621
01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.786
that would kind of
face up to the challenge

1622
01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:54.039
of what it would take to do something
that no one had ever done before.

1623
01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.834
AS: It's funny, we were a small group
of people that made it

1624
01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:59.586
and we're all
predominately pretty young

1625
01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:02.005
and somebody compared us once

1626
01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.591
to the guys at NASA
that put the man on the moon.

1627
01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:05.801
We were all too young and stupid

1628
01:20:05.884 --> 01:20:08.428
to realize what we were doing
is impossible.

1629
01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:12.975
And from story all the way
to technically making this movie.

1630
01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.519
I'm glad we were young
and ignorant and stupid

1631
01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:18.021
because we didn't let that stop us.

1632
01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:20.649
RG: 'Cause knowing
what we know now,

1633
01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:23.443
-we'd never wanna do it again.
-JL: It's impossible.

1634
01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:24.987
Kids, don't try this at home.

1635
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.905
AS: I always tell people that it's like,

1636
01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:30.200
we just made what we thought was fun

1637
01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:33.328
that we'd like to watch ourselves.
We made it for ourselves.

1638
01:20:33.412 --> 01:20:35.539
JL: That's why there's so many

1639
01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:38.584
homages to every great movie
that we have ever loved in this.

1640
01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.544
AS: We so unabashedly put them in.

1641
01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:43.714
RG: But even more importantly,
we were all...

1642
01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:47.384
We've worked together for a long time,
certainly the core group.

1643
01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:50.429
And we all were possessed
with the same dream.

1644
01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:53.682
I think it was holding that dream
in front of us the whole time

1645
01:20:53.765 --> 01:20:56.185
that we were making the film
is what kept it going

1646
01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:58.312
and what allowed us
to be crazy enough

1647
01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:00.063
to put all the time and effort into it

1648
01:21:00.147 --> 01:21:01.940
and allowed us to succeed at it.

1649
01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:04.234
JL: I love you, man.
