1
00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.704
All right, everyone!
This... is a stick-up!

2
00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.414
Don't anybody move!

3
00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:06.542
Now, empty that safe!

4
00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:11.714
Money, money, money!

5
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.091
Stop it! Stop it,
you mean, old potato!

6
00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:17.220
Quiet, Bo Peep,
or your sheep get run over!

7
00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:19.430
Help! Baa!
Help us!

8
00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:23.017
Oh, no, not my sheep!
Somebody do something!

9
00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.485
Reach for the sky!

10
00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.779
Oh, no! Sheriff Woody!

11
00:01:34.863 --> 00:01:37.281
I'm here to stop you,
One-Eyed Bart.

12
00:01:38.826 --> 00:01:40.034
How'd you know it was me?

13
00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:41.828
Are you gonna come quietly?

14
00:01:41.912 --> 00:01:43.120
You can't touch me, Sheriff!

15
00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:46.499
I brought my attack dog
with the built-in force field.

16
00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:50.545
Well, I brought my dinosaur
who eats force-field dogs.

17
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:54.757
Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!
You're going to jail, Bart!

18
00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:57.677
Say goodbye to the wife
and Tater Tots.

19
00:02:06.103 --> 00:02:08.563
You saved the day again, Woody.

20
00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:11.190
You're my favourite deputy.

21
00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:13.776
You've got a friend in me

22
00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:17.780
You've got a friend in me

23
00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:19.657
Come on,
let's wrangle up the cattle.

24
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:22.827
When the road looks rough ahead

25
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:26.747
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

26
00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:28.040
Round 'em up, cowboy!

27
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.918
Just remember
what your old pal said

28
00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.754
Boy, you've got a friend in me

29
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:35.047
Yee-haw!

30
00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:38.009
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

31
00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:39.719
Hey, cowboy!

32
00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:43.639
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

33
00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:45.766
Big and stronger too

34
00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:46.934
Come on, Woody.

35
00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.102
Maybe

36
00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:52.898
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

37
00:02:53.317 --> 00:02:55.818
It's me and you, boy

38
00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:57.278
And as the years go by

39
00:02:57.362 --> 00:02:59.155
Whoa! Whoa!

40
00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.824
Our friendship will never die

41
00:03:04.077 --> 00:03:07.288
You're gonna see
It's our destiny

42
00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:10.750
You've got a friend in me

43
00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:12.001
All right!

44
00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:14.462
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

45
00:03:14.546 --> 00:03:15.963
Score!

46
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.257
You got a friend in me

47
00:03:18.342 --> 00:03:19.383
Wow! Cool!

48
00:03:19.468 --> 00:03:22.720
-What do you think?
-Oh, this looks great, Mom!

49
00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:24.096
Okay, birthday boy...

50
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:26.223
We saw that at the store!
I asked you for it!

51
00:03:26.308 --> 00:03:28.392
-I hope I have enough places.
-Wow, look at that! That's so...

52
00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:30.061
-One, two... Four.
-Oh, my gosh, you got...

53
00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:32.855
-Yeah, I think that's gonna be enough.
-Could we leave this up 'til we move?

54
00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.857
-Well, sure! We can leave it up.
-Yeah!

55
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:36.984
Now go get Molly. Your friends
are gonna be here any minute.

56
00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.904
Okay. It's party? time, Woody.

57
00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:43.324
Yee-haw!

58
00:03:49.206 --> 00:03:50.998
Howdy, little lady.

59
00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:57.338
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

60
00:03:57.964 --> 00:03:59.006
Come on, Molly.

61
00:03:59.091 --> 00:04:00.216
Oh, you're getting heavy.

62
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:02.301
See you later, Woody.

63
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:13.437
Pull my string!
The birthday party?'s today?

64
00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:16.440
Okay, everybody,

65
00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:17.900
coast is clear!

66
00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.618
Ages 3 and up. It's on my box.

67
00:04:27.703 --> 00:04:31.622
Ages 3 and up. I'm not supposed
to be baby-sitting Princess Drool.

68
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760
Hey, Hamm.

69
00:04:44.845 --> 00:04:47.972
-Look, I'm Picasso!
-I don't get it.

70
00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:52.601
You uncultured swine! What're
you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?

71
00:04:56.982 --> 00:04:59.775
-Hey, Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
-Sir! No, sir!

72
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.778
Okay. Hey, thank you. At ease.

73
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.489
Hey, uh, Slinky?

74
00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:08.409
Right here, Woody.
I'm red this time.

75
00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:10.703
-No. Slink...
-Oh, well, all right.

76
00:05:10.787 --> 00:05:11.954
You can be red if you want.

77
00:05:12.038 --> 00:05:15.124
-Not now, Slink. I got some bad news.
-Bad news?

78
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:19.462
Just gather everyone up
for a staff meeting, and be happy.

79
00:05:19.546 --> 00:05:20.546
Got it.

80
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.964
Be happy!

81
00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:25.718
Staff meeting, everybody!
Snake, Robot, podium duty.

82
00:05:26.344 --> 00:05:27.720
Hey.

83
00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.641
Hey, Etch. Draw!

84
00:05:34.644 --> 00:05:36.812
Oh! Got me again.

85
00:05:36.897 --> 00:05:40.566
Etch, you've been working on that draw.
Fastest knobs in the West.

86
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.652
Got a staff meeting, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

87
00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:46.363
Now, where is that... Oh.

88
00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:48.991
Hey, who moved my doodle pad
way over here?

89
00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:54.622
-How're you doin', Rex?
-Were you scared? Tell me honestly.

90
00:05:54.706 --> 00:05:56.582
I was close to being scared
that time.

91
00:05:56.666 --> 00:06:00.252
I'm going for fearsome here,
but I just don't feel it.

92
00:06:00.337 --> 00:06:02.630
I think I'm just
coming off as annoying.

93
00:06:04.508 --> 00:06:06.258
Oh, hi, Bo. Hi.

94
00:06:06.343 --> 00:06:08.928
I wanted to thank you, Woody,
for saving my flock.

95
00:06:09.012 --> 00:06:11.764
Oh, hey, it was, uh, nothin'.

96
00:06:11.848 --> 00:06:16.143
What do you say I get someone else
to watch the sheep tonight?

97
00:06:16.812 --> 00:06:18.354
Oh, yeah!

98
00:06:19.523 --> 00:06:23.776
Remember, I'm just
a couple of blocks away.

99
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.653
-Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
-Come on, come on.

100
00:06:25.737 --> 00:06:27.029
Smaller toys up front.

101
00:06:29.032 --> 00:06:30.950
Hey, Woody, come on.

102
00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:38.457
Oh, thanks, Mike.

103
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.626
Okay... Whoa, whoa. Step back.

104
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.212
-For crying out loud.
-Thank you.

105
00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:47.633
Hello? Check.
That better? Great.

106
00:06:47.717 --> 00:06:50.719
Everybody hear me? Up on the shelf,
can you hear me? Great.

107
00:06:50.804 --> 00:06:53.889
Okay. First item today...

108
00:06:54.724 --> 00:06:57.309
Oh, yeah.
Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

109
00:06:57.394 --> 00:06:59.979
-What?
-Moving buddy? You can't be serious.

110
00:07:00.063 --> 00:07:02.273
I didn't know we were
supposed to have one already.

111
00:07:02.357 --> 00:07:04.733
Do we have to hold hands?

112
00:07:04.818 --> 00:07:07.069
You guys think this is a big joke.

113
00:07:07.153 --> 00:07:09.572
We've only got one week
left before the move.

114
00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:12.658
I don't want any toys left behind.
A moving buddy.

115
00:07:12.742 --> 00:07:15.286
If you don't have one, get one!

116
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.330
All right, next. Oh, yes.

117
00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:21.709
Tuesday night's plastic corrosion
awareness meeting

118
00:07:21.793 --> 00:07:24.169
was, I think, a big success.

119
00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:27.423
And we wanna thank Mr Spell
for putting that on for us.

120
00:07:27.507 --> 00:07:30.134
-Thank you, Mr Spell.
-You're welcome.

121
00:07:30.218 --> 00:07:33.637
Okay. Oh, yes.
One minor note here.

122
00:07:33.722 --> 00:07:36.348
Andy's birthday party
has been moved to today.

123
00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:38.142
Wait a minute here!

124
00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:41.353
What do you mean the party?'s today?
His birthday's not 'til next week!

125
00:07:41.438 --> 00:07:44.064
What's goin' on down there?
Is his mom losin' her marbles?

126
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:47.860
Well, obviously she wanted to
have the party? before the move.

127
00:07:47.944 --> 00:07:49.695
I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be worried.

128
00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.238
Of course Woody ain't worried.

129
00:07:51.323 --> 00:07:53.365
He's been Andy's favourite
since kindergarten.

130
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.743
Hey, hey.
Come on, Potato Head.

131
00:07:55.827 --> 00:07:59.371
If Woody says it's all right, then,
well, darn it, it's good enough for me.

132
00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:01.665
Woody has never
steered us wrong before.

133
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.377
Come on, guys. Every Christmas
and birthday we go through this.

134
00:08:05.462 --> 00:08:08.464
But what ifAndy gets
another dinosaur, a mean one?

135
00:08:08.548 --> 00:08:11.550
I just don't think I could take
that kind of rejection!

136
00:08:11.635 --> 00:08:13.928
Hey, listen,
no one's getting replaced.

137
00:08:14.012 --> 00:08:16.931
This is Andy
we're talking about.

138
00:08:17.015 --> 00:08:20.100
It doesn't matter
how much we're played with.

139
00:08:23.605 --> 00:08:26.398
What matters is that we're here
for Andy when he needs us.

140
00:08:26.483 --> 00:08:28.525
That's what we're made for, right?

141
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.363
Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff
meeting, but... they're here!

142
00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:34.198
Birthday guests at three o'clock!

143
00:08:34.282 --> 00:08:36.408
Stay calm, everyone!

144
00:08:36.493 --> 00:08:37.952
Hey!

145
00:08:39.996 --> 00:08:40.996
Meeting adjourned.

146
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:43.499
Ho, boy! Will you take a look
at all those presents?

147
00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:46.001
I can't see a thing.

148
00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:52.216
Yes, sir, we're next month's
garage sale fodder for sure.

149
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.135
-Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
-Oh, for crying out loud.

150
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.347
-They're all in boxes, you idiot.
-They're getting bigger.

151
00:08:58.431 --> 00:09:00.724
Wait, there's a nice
little one over there.

152
00:09:00.809 --> 00:09:01.850
Hi!

153
00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:07.022
-Spell, trash can.
-We're doomed!

154
00:09:07.107 --> 00:09:08.857
All right! All right!

155
00:09:09.359 --> 00:09:12.611
If I send out the troops,
will you all calm down?

156
00:09:12.696 --> 00:09:16.532
-Yes! Yes! We promise!
-Okay! Save your batteries.

157
00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:18.617
Very good, Woody.
That's using the old noodle.

158
00:09:21.037 --> 00:09:25.207
Sergeant, establish
a recon post downstairs. Code Red!

159
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.751
-You know what to do.
-Yes, sir!

160
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.671
All right, men.
You heard him. Code Red!

161
00:09:30.755 --> 00:09:34.133
Repeat, we are at Code Red.
Recon plan Charlie. Execute!

162
00:09:34.217 --> 00:09:36.343
Let's move!
Move, move, move, move!

163
00:09:54.904 --> 00:09:56.363
Yeah!

164
00:09:59.075 --> 00:10:00.576
Okay, come on, kids.

165
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.579
Everyone in the living room.
It's almost time for the presents.

166
00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:27.352
All right, gangway, gangway.

167
00:10:27.437 --> 00:10:30.647
And this is how we find out

168
00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:32.941
what is in those presents.

169
00:10:36.738 --> 00:10:39.656
Okay, who's hungry?

170
00:10:40.492 --> 00:10:41.700
Here come the chips!

171
00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:44.244
I've got Cool Ranch
and barbecue!

172
00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:46.288
What in the world... Oh!

173
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:49.792
I thought I told him
to pick these up.

174
00:10:50.085 --> 00:10:52.503
Shouldn't they be there by now?
What's taking them so long?

175
00:10:52.587 --> 00:10:55.672
Hey, these guys are professionals.
They're the best.

176
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:58.717
Come on!
They're not lying down on the job.

177
00:11:09.729 --> 00:11:11.897
Go on without me!
Just go!

178
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:14.817
A good soldier never
leaves a man behind.

179
00:11:32.544 --> 00:11:34.711
Okay, everybody, come on.

180
00:11:34.796 --> 00:11:37.756
Everybody settle down.
Now, kids. Everybody...

181
00:11:37.841 --> 00:11:41.593
You sit in a circle. No, Andy.
Andy, you sit in the middle there.

182
00:11:41.678 --> 00:11:45.722
Good. And... Which present
are you gonna open first?

183
00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:48.851
-Mine!
-There they are.

184
00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:51.645
Come in, Mother Bird.
This is Alpha Bravo.

185
00:11:51.729 --> 00:11:53.981
-This is it! This is it! Quiet, quiet!
-Come in, Mother Bird.

186
00:11:54.065 --> 00:11:57.192
All right, Andy's opening
the first present now.

187
00:11:57.277 --> 00:12:00.112
Mrs Potato Head! Mrs Potato Head!
Mrs Potato Head!

188
00:12:00.947 --> 00:12:02.656
Hey, I can dream, can't I?

189
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.242
The bow's coming off.
He's ripping the wrapping paper.

190
00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:07.828
It's a... It's...
It's a... a lunch box.

191
00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:10.122
-We've got a lunch box here.
-A lunch box?

192
00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:11.999
-Lunch box?
-For lunch.

193
00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:14.585
Okay, second present.
It appears to be...

194
00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:17.546
-Okay, it's bed sheets.
-Who invited that kid?

195
00:12:22.635 --> 00:12:24.887
Oh! Only one left.

196
00:12:25.722 --> 00:12:27.681
-Okay, we're on the last present now.
-Last present!

197
00:12:27.765 --> 00:12:30.142
It's a big one. It's a...

198
00:12:30.226 --> 00:12:32.769
-lt's a board game! Repeat, Battleship!
-Whew!

199
00:12:32.854 --> 00:12:35.063
Hallelujah!

200
00:12:35.148 --> 00:12:37.024
-Yeah! All right!
-Hey, watch it!

201
00:12:37.108 --> 00:12:38.859
Sorry there, old spud head.

202
00:12:38.943 --> 00:12:42.696
Mission accomplished. Well done, men.
Pack it up. We're goin' home.

203
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.115
So did I tell ya?
Nothin' to worry about.

204
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.619
I knew you were right all along, Woody.
Never doubted ya for a second.

205
00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:50.996
Wait a minute. Oh!

206
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.167
-What do we have here?
-Wait! Turn that thing back on!

207
00:12:55.251 --> 00:12:57.044
Come in, Mother Bird!
Come in, Mother Bird!

208
00:12:57.128 --> 00:12:59.838
Mom has pulled a surprise
present from the closet.

209
00:12:59.923 --> 00:13:02.341
Andy's opening it.
He's really excited about this one.

210
00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:04.343
-Mom, what is it?
-It's a huge package.

211
00:13:04.427 --> 00:13:07.387
Oh, get outta the... One of the kids
is in the way. I can't see.

212
00:13:08.056 --> 00:13:10.432
-It's a...
-Wow!

213
00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:14.937
It's a what? What is it?

214
00:13:16.439 --> 00:13:17.856
-Oh, no!
-Oh, ya big lizard!

215
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:20.567
-Now we'll never know what it is!
-Way to go, Rex!

216
00:13:20.652 --> 00:13:22.611
No, no! Turn 'em around!
Turn 'em around!

217
00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:25.197
He's puttin' 'em in backwa...
Here, you're puttin' 'em in backwards!

218
00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:28.408
Plus is positive, minus is negative!
Oh, let me!

219
00:13:29.702 --> 00:13:31.912
Let's go to my room, guys!

220
00:13:31.996 --> 00:13:34.831
Red alert! Red alert!
Andy is coming upstairs!

221
00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:36.875
-There!
-Juvenile intrusion!

222
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.752
Repeat, resume
your positions now!

223
00:13:38.836 --> 00:13:41.505
Andy's coming! Everybody,
back to your places! Hurry!

224
00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:43.590
Get to your places!
Get to your places!

225
00:13:43.675 --> 00:13:46.009
Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear?
Did you see my ear?

226
00:13:46.094 --> 00:13:49.137
Out of my way! Here I come!
Here I come!

227
00:13:59.482 --> 00:14:03.068
Hey, look, its lasers light up.
Take that, Zurg!

228
00:14:03.152 --> 00:14:06.446
Quick, make a space.
This is where the spaceship lands.

229
00:14:06.531 --> 00:14:08.699
And he does it like that.
And he does a karate chop action!

230
00:14:08.783 --> 00:14:11.702
Come on down, guys!
It's time for games!

231
00:14:11.786 --> 00:14:13.829
We've got prizes!

232
00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:26.591
-What is it?
-Can you see it?

233
00:14:27.176 --> 00:14:31.013
-What the heck is up there?
-Woody, who's up there with ya?

234
00:14:33.308 --> 00:14:34.266
Woody?

235
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.269
-What are you doing under the bed?
-Nothin'. Nothin'.

236
00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:39.980
I'm sure Andy was just
a little excited, that's all.

237
00:14:40.064 --> 00:14:42.816
Too much cake and ice cream,
I suppose. It's just a mistake!

238
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.695
Well, that mistake is sitting
in your spot, Woody.

239
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.948
-Have you been replaced?
-What did I tell you earlier?

240
00:14:50.033 --> 00:14:51.867
No one is getting replaced.

241
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:55.662
Now, let's all be polite and give
whatever it is up there

242
00:14:55.747 --> 00:14:59.416
a nice, big
Andy's-room welcome.

243
00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:26.193
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.

244
00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:28.195
Come in, Star Command.

245
00:15:29.072 --> 00:15:31.156
Star Command, come in.
Do you read me?

246
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.493
Why don't they answer? My ship!

247
00:15:37.663 --> 00:15:40.582
Blast! This'll take weeks to repair.

248
00:15:41.167 --> 00:15:44.211
Buzz Lightyear mission log,
stardate 4-0-7-2.

249
00:15:44.295 --> 00:15:47.589
My ship has run off course
en route to sector 1 2.

250
00:15:47.673 --> 00:15:50.175
I've crash-landed
on a strange planet.

251
00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:52.761
The impact must've awoken me
from hypersleep.

252
00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:57.599
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

253
00:15:58.351 --> 00:16:00.769
No readout yet
if the air is breathable.

254
00:16:00.853 --> 00:16:03.939
And there seems to be no sign
of intelligent life anywhere.

255
00:16:04.023 --> 00:16:05.023
Hello!

256
00:16:06.192 --> 00:16:08.360
Whoa! Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

257
00:16:08.444 --> 00:16:10.737
Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to.

258
00:16:10.822 --> 00:16:13.240
Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody.

259
00:16:13.324 --> 00:16:17.202
And this is Andy's room.
That's all I wanted to say.

260
00:16:17.286 --> 00:16:20.038
And also, there has been
a bit of a mix-up.

261
00:16:20.123 --> 00:16:22.416
This is my spot, see,
the bed here.

262
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.793
Local law enforcement.
It's about time you got here.

263
00:16:24.877 --> 00:16:27.879
I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger,
Universe Protection Unit.

264
00:16:27.964 --> 00:16:30.173
My ship has crash-landed here
by mistake.

265
00:16:30.258 --> 00:16:34.052
Yes, it is a mistake because,
you see, the bed here is my spot.

266
00:16:34.137 --> 00:16:35.720
I need to repair
my turbo boosters.

267
00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:38.932
Do you people still use fossil fuel, or
have you discovered crystallic fusion?

268
00:16:39.016 --> 00:16:40.976
Well, let's see. We got double-A's.

269
00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:43.437
Watch yourself!
Halt! Who goes there?

270
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:45.897
Don't shoot!
It's okay. Friends.

271
00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:49.734
-Do you know these life-forms?
-Yes! They're Andy's toys.

272
00:16:49.819 --> 00:16:52.195
All right, everyone,
you're clear to come up.

273
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.906
I am Buzz Lightyear.
I come in peace.

274
00:16:54.991 --> 00:16:58.326
Oh, I'm so glad
you're not a dinosaur!

275
00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.579
Wh-why, thank you!

276
00:17:00.663 --> 00:17:03.373
Now, thank you all
for your kind welcome!

277
00:17:03.458 --> 00:17:06.209
-Say, what's that button do?
-I'll show you.

278
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.920
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

279
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.090
Hey, Woody's got something like that.
His is a pull string.

280
00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:14.426
-Only it's...
-Only it sounds like a car ran over it.

281
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.221
Oh, yeah, but not like this.
This is a quality sound system.

282
00:17:18.306 --> 00:17:19.848
Probably all copper wiring, huh?

283
00:17:19.932 --> 00:17:23.185
So, where you from?
Singapore? Hong Kong?

284
00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:27.522
Well, no. Actually, I'm stationed up
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

285
00:17:27.857 --> 00:17:30.442
As a member of the elite
Universe Protection Unit

286
00:17:30.526 --> 00:17:31.943
of the Space Ranger Corps,

287
00:17:32.028 --> 00:17:34.738
I protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion

288
00:17:34.822 --> 00:17:38.909
from the evil Emperor Zurg,
sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

289
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.411
Oh, really?
I'm from Playskool.

290
00:17:41.621 --> 00:17:43.955
And I'm from Mattel.
Well, I'm not really from Mattel.

291
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.582
I'm actually from a smaller company

292
00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:47.834
that was purchased
in a leveraged buyout.

293
00:17:48.211 --> 00:17:49.711
You'd think they'd never seen
a new toy before.

294
00:17:49.795 --> 00:17:51.463
Well, sure. Look at him.

295
00:17:51.547 --> 00:17:54.341
He's got more gadgets on him
than a Swiss Army knife.

296
00:17:56.135 --> 00:17:57.135
Please be careful.

297
00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.803
You don't want to be in the way
when my laser goes off.

298
00:17:58.888 --> 00:18:02.349
Hey, a laser! How come
you don't have a laser, Woody?

299
00:18:02.433 --> 00:18:05.393
It's not a laser! It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.

300
00:18:05.478 --> 00:18:07.145
-What's with him?
-Laser envy.

301
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.480
All right, that's enough!

302
00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:11.983
Look, we're all very impressed
with Andy's new toy.

303
00:18:12.068 --> 00:18:14.444
-Toy?
-T-O-Y. Toy!

304
00:18:14.528 --> 00:18:18.490
Excuse me, I think the word
you're searching for is "Space Ranger."

305
00:18:18.574 --> 00:18:23.036
The word I'm searching for I can't say
because there's preschool toys present.

306
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.621
Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?

307
00:18:25.248 --> 00:18:27.749
Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious.

308
00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:30.460
What does a Space Ranger
actually do?

309
00:18:30.544 --> 00:18:32.587
He's not a Space Ranger!

310
00:18:32.672 --> 00:18:36.341
He doesn't fight evil
or, or shoot lasers or fly!

311
00:18:36.425 --> 00:18:37.842
Excuse me.

312
00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:42.347
Oh, impressive wingspan!
Very good!

313
00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:47.185
Oh, what? What?
These are plastic. He can't fly!

314
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.730
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy,
and I can fly.

315
00:18:50.815 --> 00:18:54.109
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

316
00:18:54.193 --> 00:18:55.193
-You can't.
-Can.

317
00:18:55.278 --> 00:18:56.987
Can't. Can't. Can't!

318
00:18:57.071 --> 00:18:59.531
I tell you, I could fly around
this room with my eyes closed!

319
00:18:59.615 --> 00:19:03.743
-Okay, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it.
-All right, then, I will.

320
00:19:03.828 --> 00:19:05.787
Stand back, everyone!

321
00:19:13.462 --> 00:19:16.214
To infinity and beyond!

322
00:19:42.825 --> 00:19:45.243
-Can!
-Whoa!

323
00:19:45.828 --> 00:19:48.538
Oh, wow, you flew magnificently!

324
00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:52.751
-I found my movin' buddy.
-Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.

325
00:19:52.835 --> 00:19:56.671
That wasn't flying!
That was... falling with style.

326
00:19:56.756 --> 00:19:59.924
Man, the dolls must really
go for you. Can you teach me that?

327
00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.928
-Golly bob howdy!
-Oh, shut up!

328
00:20:04.013 --> 00:20:05.013
You know, in a couple of days,

329
00:20:05.097 --> 00:20:07.432
everything will be just the way
it was. They'll see.

330
00:20:08.184 --> 00:20:09.184
They'll see.

331
00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:12.645
I'm still Andy's favourite toy.

332
00:20:13.356 --> 00:20:16.024
I was on top of the world
livin' high

333
00:20:16.108 --> 00:20:18.109
It was right in my pocket

334
00:20:20.363 --> 00:20:22.072
I was livin' the life

335
00:20:22.156 --> 00:20:25.533
Things were just the way
they should be

336
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:30.080
When from out of the sky
like a bomb

337
00:20:30.164 --> 00:20:32.457
Comes some little punk
in a rocket

338
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.129
Now all of a sudden some
strange things are happening to me

339
00:20:38.214 --> 00:20:40.215
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

340
00:20:41.884 --> 00:20:44.594
Strange

341
00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:47.055
Things are happening to me

342
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.560
Strange

343
00:20:52.645 --> 00:20:55.814
Things

344
00:20:55.898 --> 00:21:01.111
Strange things are happening to me

345
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.780
Ain't no doubt about it

346
00:21:09.578 --> 00:21:13.206
I had friends
I had lots of friends

347
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.751
Now all my friends are gone

348
00:21:16.836 --> 00:21:20.088
And I'm doin' the best I can

349
00:21:20.172 --> 00:21:22.006
To carry on

350
00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:25.468
-I had power
-Power

351
00:21:25.553 --> 00:21:27.929
-I was respected
-Respected

352
00:21:28.639 --> 00:21:31.057
But not any more

353
00:21:31.142 --> 00:21:33.852
And I've lost the love of the one

354
00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:36.729
Whom I adore

355
00:21:37.314 --> 00:21:41.151
Let me tell you 'bout it
Strange

356
00:21:41.235 --> 00:21:44.028
Things are happenin' to me

357
00:21:45.573 --> 00:21:49.200
Strange

358
00:21:49.285 --> 00:21:51.286
Things

359
00:21:52.788 --> 00:21:55.373
Strange

360
00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:58.209
Things are happenin' to me

361
00:21:58.294 --> 00:22:00.712
Ain't no doubt about it

362
00:22:03.466 --> 00:22:07.010
Strange

363
00:22:07.094 --> 00:22:09.554
Things

364
00:22:10.681 --> 00:22:13.850
Strange

365
00:22:14.185 --> 00:22:15.977
Things

366
00:22:18.314 --> 00:22:19.814
Finally!

367
00:22:21.442 --> 00:22:22.859
Hey, who's got my hat?

368
00:22:22.943 --> 00:22:25.737
Look, I'm Woody!
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

369
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.948
Gimme that!

370
00:22:29.158 --> 00:22:31.701
Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog,
let me show you something.

371
00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:34.704
It looks as though I've been
accepted into your culture.

372
00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:37.707
Your chief, Andy,
inscribed his name on me.

373
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:38.833
Wow!

374
00:22:38.918 --> 00:22:40.877
With permanent ink too!

375
00:22:40.961 --> 00:22:43.588
Well, I must get back
to repairing my ship.

376
00:22:47.176 --> 00:22:49.302
Don't let it get to you, Woody.

377
00:22:49.386 --> 00:22:51.763
Let what? I don't...
What do you mean? Who?

378
00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:54.933
I know Andy's
excited about Buzz.

379
00:22:55.017 --> 00:22:58.394
But you know he'll always have
a special place for you.

380
00:22:58.479 --> 00:23:02.357
-Yeah, like the attic.
-All right, that's it!

381
00:23:03.859 --> 00:23:05.401
Unidirectional bonding strip.

382
00:23:05.486 --> 00:23:07.862
Mr Lightyear wants more tape.

383
00:23:10.282 --> 00:23:13.660
Listen, Light Snack,
you stay away from Andy.

384
00:23:13.744 --> 00:23:17.497
He's mine, and no one
is taking him away from me.

385
00:23:17.581 --> 00:23:19.123
What are you talking about?

386
00:23:19.208 --> 00:23:21.751
Where's that bonding strip?

387
00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:24.337
And another thing,

388
00:23:24.421 --> 00:23:28.633
stop with this spaceman thing!
It's getting on my nerves!

389
00:23:28.717 --> 00:23:31.052
Are you saying you wanna lodge
a complaint with Star Command?

390
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.098
Okay! Well, so you wanna
do it the hard way, huh?

391
00:23:35.224 --> 00:23:39.060
-Don't even think about it, cowboy.
-Oh, yeah, tough guy?

392
00:23:50.823 --> 00:23:52.532
The air isn't... toxic.

393
00:23:53.158 --> 00:23:56.202
How dare you open a spaceman's
helmet on an uncharted planet!

394
00:23:56.287 --> 00:23:59.622
My eyeballs could've been
sucked from their sockets!

395
00:24:00.499 --> 00:24:04.752
You actually think
you're the Buzz Lightyear?

396
00:24:05.212 --> 00:24:07.839
Oh, all this time
I thought it was an act!

397
00:24:07.923 --> 00:24:11.718
Hey, guys, look!
It's the real Buzz Lightyear!

398
00:24:11.802 --> 00:24:13.052
You're mocking me,
aren't you?

399
00:24:13.137 --> 00:24:15.888
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Buzz, look, an alien!

400
00:24:15.973 --> 00:24:17.390
Where?

401
00:24:25.107 --> 00:24:26.649
Yes!

402
00:24:30.154 --> 00:24:31.195
It's Sid!

403
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.031
Don't move!

404
00:24:33.115 --> 00:24:34.782
I thought he was at summer camp.

405
00:24:34.867 --> 00:24:36.951
They must've kicked him out
early this year.

406
00:24:37.453 --> 00:24:39.287
Oh, no, not Sid!

407
00:24:39.455 --> 00:24:40.955
Incoming!

408
00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:46.127
-Who is it this time?
-I... I can't... I can't tell.

409
00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:48.379
-Hey, where's Lenny?
-Right here, Woody.

410
00:24:48.464 --> 00:24:52.300
Oh, no, I can't bear to watch
one of these again.

411
00:24:52.384 --> 00:24:55.553
Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl.

412
00:24:55.638 --> 00:24:56.596
What's going on?

413
00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.391
Nothing that concerns you spacemen,
just us toys.

414
00:25:00.476 --> 00:25:01.976
I'd better take a look anyway.

415
00:25:03.103 --> 00:25:05.563
Why is that soldier
strapped to an explosive device?

416
00:25:05.648 --> 00:25:07.899
That's why, Sid.

417
00:25:09.026 --> 00:25:10.360
Sure is a hairy fellow.

418
00:25:10.444 --> 00:25:12.487
No, no, that's Scud, you idiot.

419
00:25:12.821 --> 00:25:14.989
That is Sid.

420
00:25:16.241 --> 00:25:18.993
-You mean that happy child?
-That ain't no happy child.

421
00:25:19.078 --> 00:25:22.330
He tortures toys, just for fun!

422
00:25:25.501 --> 00:25:28.002
Well, then we've got
to do something.

423
00:25:28.504 --> 00:25:29.921
What are you doing?
Get down from there!

424
00:25:30.005 --> 00:25:33.257
-I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson.
-Yeah, sure. You go ahead.

425
00:25:33.342 --> 00:25:35.718
Melt him with your scary laser.

426
00:25:35.803 --> 00:25:38.763
Be careful with that!
It's extremely dangerous.

427
00:25:38.847 --> 00:25:41.599
He's lighting it!
He's lighting it! Hit the dirt!

428
00:25:42.434 --> 00:25:44.477
Look out!

429
00:25:48.691 --> 00:25:51.275
Yes! He's gone! He's history!

430
00:25:52.861 --> 00:25:54.445
I could've stopped him.

431
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.699
Buzz, I would love
to see you try.

432
00:25:58.117 --> 00:26:00.243
Of course, I'd love
to see you as a crater.

433
00:26:01.328 --> 00:26:03.955
The sooner we move, the better.

434
00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:05.832
Yeah!

435
00:26:12.005 --> 00:26:13.881
To infinity and beyond!

436
00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:17.218
All this packing
makes me hungry.

437
00:26:17.302 --> 00:26:20.221
What would you say to dinner
at, oh, Pizza Planet?

438
00:26:20.305 --> 00:26:23.224
Pizza Planet? Oh, cool!

439
00:26:24.017 --> 00:26:26.060
Go wash your hands,
and I'll get Molly ready.

440
00:26:26.145 --> 00:26:29.439
-Can I bring some toys?
-You can bring one toy.

441
00:26:29.523 --> 00:26:32.483
-Just one?
-One toy?

442
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.949
Will Andy pick me?

443
00:26:43.495 --> 00:26:45.538
"Don't count on it"?

444
00:27:06.643 --> 00:27:09.270
Buzz! Oh, Buzz!
Buzz Lightyear.

445
00:27:09.354 --> 00:27:11.689
Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness.
We've got trouble!

446
00:27:11.773 --> 00:27:14.442
-Trouble? Where?
-Down there. Just down there.

447
00:27:14.526 --> 00:27:17.278
A helpless toy, it's...
it's trapped, Buzz!

448
00:27:17.362 --> 00:27:19.780
Then we've no time to lose.

449
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:26.746
I don't see anything!

450
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.040
Oh, he's there!
Just, just keep looking!

451
00:27:29.124 --> 00:27:30.416
What kind of toy...

452
00:27:48.977 --> 00:27:50.186
Buzz!

453
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.479
Buzz!

454
00:27:52.814 --> 00:27:54.690
I don't see him in the driveway.

455
00:27:54.775 --> 00:27:58.402
-I think he bounced into Sid's yard!
-Oh! Buzz!

456
00:28:00.739 --> 00:28:04.700
Hey, everyone, R.C.'s trying to
say something. What is it, boy?

457
00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:08.496
-He's saying that this was no accident.
-What do you mean?

458
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.998
-I mean Humpty-Dumpty was pushed...
-No!

459
00:28:11.083 --> 00:28:12.333
...by Woody!

460
00:28:12.417 --> 00:28:14.252
-What?
-Wait a minute.

461
00:28:14.336 --> 00:28:18.589
You don't think I meant to knock Buzz
out the window, do you? Potato Head?

462
00:28:18.674 --> 00:28:21.759
That's Mr Potato Head to you,
you back-stabbing murderer!

463
00:28:21.843 --> 00:28:23.928
Now, it was an accident, guys.

464
00:28:24.012 --> 00:28:26.806
Come on.
Now, you, you gotta believe me.

465
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:30.351
We believe ya, Woody.
Right, Rex?

466
00:28:30.435 --> 00:28:32.937
Well, ye... N...
I don't like confrontations!

467
00:28:33.021 --> 00:28:36.691
Where is your honour, dirt bag?
You are an absolute disgrace!

468
00:28:36.775 --> 00:28:38.401
You don't deserve to... Hey!

469
00:28:38.485 --> 00:28:41.779
You couldn't handle Buzz cutting
in on your playtime, could you, Woody?

470
00:28:41.863 --> 00:28:45.950
Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz
just might be Andy's new favourite toy.

471
00:28:46.034 --> 00:28:47.326
So you got rid of him.

472
00:28:47.411 --> 00:28:50.121
Well, what ifAndy starts playing
with me more, Woody, huh?

473
00:28:50.205 --> 00:28:52.123
You gonna knock me
outta the window too?

474
00:28:52.207 --> 00:28:54.333
I don't think we should
give him the chance.

475
00:28:54.501 --> 00:28:56.460
There he is, men. Frag him!

476
00:28:56.545 --> 00:28:58.045
Let's string him up
by his pull string!

477
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.506
-I got dibs on his hat!
-Would you boys stop it!

478
00:29:00.591 --> 00:29:01.632
Tackle him!

479
00:29:01.717 --> 00:29:04.302
No, no, no! Wait!
I can explain everything!

480
00:29:04.386 --> 00:29:07.305
Okay, Mom, be right down.
I've gotta get Buzz.

481
00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:08.514
Retreat!

482
00:29:13.478 --> 00:29:15.479
Mom, do you know
where Buzz is?

483
00:29:15.564 --> 00:29:17.064
No, I haven't seen him.

484
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.112
-Andy, I'm heading out the door!
-But, Mom, I can't find him!

485
00:29:23.196 --> 00:29:25.656
Honey, just grab some other toy.
Now, come on!

486
00:29:25.907 --> 00:29:27.742
Oh, okay.

487
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:36.167
I couldn't find my Buzz.
I know I left him right there.

488
00:29:36.251 --> 00:29:39.253
Honey, I'm sure he's around.
You'll find him.

489
00:29:53.268 --> 00:29:56.020
It's too short!
We need more monkeys!

490
00:29:56.104 --> 00:29:59.190
There aren't any more!
That's the whole barrel!

491
00:30:00.484 --> 00:30:02.526
Buzz, the monkeys
aren't working!

492
00:30:02.611 --> 00:30:06.572
We're formulating another plan!
Stay calm!

493
00:30:06.657 --> 00:30:08.616
Oh, where could he be?

494
00:30:20.295 --> 00:30:23.464
-Can I help pump the gas?
-Sure! I'll even let you drive.

495
00:30:23.548 --> 00:30:25.549
-Yeah?
-Yeah, when you're 1 6.

496
00:30:26.301 --> 00:30:27.551
Funny, Mom.

497
00:30:27.636 --> 00:30:32.056
Great. How am I gonna convince
those guys it was an accident?

498
00:30:35.894 --> 00:30:37.687
Buzz!

499
00:30:39.314 --> 00:30:42.066
Buzz! Ha! You're alive!

500
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.403
This is great!
Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved.

501
00:30:45.487 --> 00:30:47.988
Andy'll find you here,
he'll take us back to the room

502
00:30:48.073 --> 00:30:53.285
and then you can tell everyone
that this was all just a big mistake.

503
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.163
Huh? Right? Buddy?

504
00:30:56.665 --> 00:30:59.625
I just want you to know that even
though you tried to terminate me,

505
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.586
revenge is not an idea
we promote on my planet.

506
00:31:02.671 --> 00:31:06.716
-Oh. Well, that's good.
-But we're not on my planet, are we?

507
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.800
No.

508
00:31:14.391 --> 00:31:16.392
Okay, come on!

509
00:31:16.935 --> 00:31:18.644
You want a piece of me?

510
00:31:25.527 --> 00:31:28.237
Buzz, Buzz,
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.

511
00:31:28.321 --> 00:31:31.240
-Next stop.
-Pizza Planet! Yeah!

512
00:31:34.077 --> 00:31:35.077
Andy!

513
00:31:43.837 --> 00:31:46.380
Wh... Doesn't he realise
that I'm not there?

514
00:31:48.258 --> 00:31:50.050
I'm lost!

515
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:53.387
Oh, I'm a lost toy!

516
00:31:58.727 --> 00:32:00.019
Buzz Lightyear mission log.

517
00:32:00.103 --> 00:32:03.481
The local sheriff and I seem to be at
a huge refuelling station of some sort.

518
00:32:03.565 --> 00:32:04.607
You!

519
00:32:25.879 --> 00:32:28.130
-According to my navi-computer, the...
-Shut up!

520
00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:31.509
-Just shut up, you idiot!
-Sheriff, this is no time to panic.

521
00:32:31.593 --> 00:32:35.179
This is the perfect time to panic.
I'm lost. Andy is gone.

522
00:32:35.263 --> 00:32:37.473
They're gonna move from their house
in two days, and it's all your fault!

523
00:32:37.557 --> 00:32:40.684
My... My fault? If you hadn't pushed me
out of the window in the first place...

524
00:32:40.769 --> 00:32:41.852
Oh, yeah?

525
00:32:41.937 --> 00:32:45.022
Well, if you hadn't shown up in your
stupid little cardboard spaceship

526
00:32:45.106 --> 00:32:47.233
and taken away everything
that was important to me...

527
00:32:47.317 --> 00:32:48.692
Don't talk to me
about importance!

528
00:32:48.777 --> 00:32:51.821
Because of you the security
of this entire universe is in jeopardy!

529
00:32:51.905 --> 00:32:54.365
What? What are
you talkin' about?

530
00:32:54.449 --> 00:32:57.159
Right now, poised at
the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg

531
00:32:57.244 --> 00:32:58.869
has been secretly building
a weapon

532
00:32:58.954 --> 00:33:02.206
with the destructive capacity
to annihilate an entire planet!

533
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.544
I alone have information that reveals
this weapon's only weakness.

534
00:33:06.628 --> 00:33:08.838
And you, my friend,
are responsible

535
00:33:08.922 --> 00:33:12.299
for delaying my rendezvous
with Star Command!

536
00:33:12.384 --> 00:33:15.886
You... are... a... toy!

537
00:33:15.971 --> 00:33:18.222
You aren't the real
Buzz Lightyear! You're a...

538
00:33:18.306 --> 00:33:23.102
You're an action figure!
You are a child's plaything!

539
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.731
You are a sad, strange little man,
and you have my pity.

540
00:33:27.816 --> 00:33:28.983
Farewell.

541
00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:32.152
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance, ya loony!

542
00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:34.572
"Rendezvous with Star Command."

543
00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:38.200
-Hey, gas dude!
-You talkin' to me?

544
00:33:38.285 --> 00:33:40.744
-Yeah, man. Can you help me?
-Pizza Planet? Andy!

545
00:33:40.829 --> 00:33:42.788
Do you know
where Cutting Boulevard is?

546
00:33:42.873 --> 00:33:44.248
Oh, no!

547
00:33:44.332 --> 00:33:47.209
I can't show my face
in that room without Buzz.

548
00:33:47.294 --> 00:33:50.212
-Buzz! Buzz, come back!
-Go away!

549
00:33:50.672 --> 00:33:53.674
No! Buzz, you gotta
come back! I...

550
00:33:55.552 --> 00:33:57.887
I found a spaceship!

551
00:33:59.556 --> 00:34:01.765
It's a spaceship, Buzz!

552
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:06.854
Come on, man, hurry up! Like,
the pizzas are getting cold here!

553
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:10.566
-Cutting Boulevard, huh?
-Yeah, yeah. Which way?

554
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.527
Now, you're sure this space freighter
will return to its port of origin

555
00:34:13.612 --> 00:34:16.030
once it jettisons its food supply?

556
00:34:16.114 --> 00:34:20.534
And when we get there, we'll be able
to find a way to transport you home.

557
00:34:20.619 --> 00:34:24.163
-Well, then, let's climb aboard.
-No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz!

558
00:34:24.247 --> 00:34:26.290
Let's get in the back.
No one will see us there.

559
00:34:26.374 --> 00:34:29.585
Negative. There are no restraining
harnesses in the cargo area.

560
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:31.879
-We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
-Yeah, bu...

561
00:34:32.505 --> 00:34:34.256
Buzz! Buzz!

562
00:34:34.341 --> 00:34:35.799
That's two lefts
and a right, huh?

563
00:34:35.884 --> 00:34:38.802
-Thanks for the directions, okay?
-Yeah. And remember, kid...

564
00:34:38.887 --> 00:34:40.304
Buzz!

565
00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:55.611
It's safer in the cockpit
than the cargo bay. What an idiot.

566
00:35:20.428 --> 00:35:22.179
Next shuttle lift-off
is scheduled for

567
00:35:22.263 --> 00:35:25.683
T-minus 30 minutes and counting.

568
00:35:29.187 --> 00:35:31.271
You are clear to enter.

569
00:35:31.356 --> 00:35:33.148
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

570
00:35:34.442 --> 00:35:36.944
The white zone
is for immediate pizza...

571
00:35:37.529 --> 00:35:38.529
Sheriff!

572
00:35:40.281 --> 00:35:41.699
There you are.

573
00:35:42.283 --> 00:35:45.077
Now, the entrance is heavily guarded.
We need a way to get inside.

574
00:35:47.122 --> 00:35:48.372
Great idea, Woody.

575
00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:50.582
I like your thinkin'.

576
00:35:51.376 --> 00:35:54.545
You are clear to enter.
Welcome to Pizza Planet.

577
00:35:54.629 --> 00:35:56.296
Now!

578
00:35:56.381 --> 00:35:59.216
Quickly, Sheriff!
The air lock is closing.

579
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.927
Jones, party of five,
your shuttle is now boarding...

580
00:36:02.012 --> 00:36:03.971
Hey, Mom,
can we have some tokens?

581
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.682
Watch where you're going!

582
00:36:06.766 --> 00:36:08.225
Sorry.

583
00:36:14.149 --> 00:36:18.444
...nine, eight, seven, six,

584
00:36:18.528 --> 00:36:21.613
five, four, three,

585
00:36:21.698 --> 00:36:23.657
two, one.

586
00:36:23.742 --> 00:36:27.286
What a spaceport!
Good work, Woody.

587
00:36:36.087 --> 00:36:38.922
Mom, can I play Black Hole?
Please, please, please?

588
00:36:39.007 --> 00:36:40.924
-Andy!
-Now, we need to find a ship

589
00:36:41.009 --> 00:36:44.428
-that's headed for Sector 1 2.
-Wait a minute. No, Buzz! This way.

590
00:36:44.512 --> 00:36:47.848
-There's a special ship. I just saw it.
-You mean it has hyperdrive?

591
00:36:48.516 --> 00:36:50.559
Hyperactive hyperdrive.

592
00:36:50.643 --> 00:36:53.520
And Astro... turf!

593
00:36:53.605 --> 00:36:56.106
-Where is it? I don't see the...
-Come on. That's it.

594
00:36:56.191 --> 00:36:57.608
Spaceship!

595
00:36:59.402 --> 00:37:02.654
All right, Buzz, get ready.
And...

596
00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:04.573
-And the universe explodes!
-Okay, Buzz, when I say go,

597
00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:07.326
we're gonna jump in the basket.
Buzz!

598
00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:11.038
-No!
-Mom, if I eat all my pizza,

599
00:37:11.122 --> 00:37:12.623
can I have some alien slime?

600
00:37:13.416 --> 00:37:15.459
This cannot be happening to me.

601
00:37:24.886 --> 00:37:26.970
-A stranger.
-From the outside.

602
00:37:28.765 --> 00:37:31.642
Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear.

603
00:37:31.726 --> 00:37:34.144
I come in peace.

604
00:37:37.065 --> 00:37:39.691
Before your space journey,
re-energise yourself

605
00:37:39.776 --> 00:37:43.403
with a slice of pepperoni,
now boarding at counter three.

606
00:37:44.322 --> 00:37:46.365
This is an intergalactic emergency.

607
00:37:46.449 --> 00:37:48.909
I need to commandeer
your vessel to Sector 1 2.

608
00:37:48.993 --> 00:37:51.370
Who's in charge here?

609
00:37:51.454 --> 00:37:54.289
The claw!

610
00:37:56.334 --> 00:37:57.626
The claw is our master.

611
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.962
The claw chooses who will go
and who will stay.

612
00:38:00.046 --> 00:38:03.465
-This is ludicrous.
-Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there?

613
00:38:04.676 --> 00:38:05.968
Take that!

614
00:38:07.262 --> 00:38:09.346
Oh, no! Sid!

615
00:38:09.764 --> 00:38:11.014
Get down!

616
00:38:13.393 --> 00:38:14.685
What's gotten into you? I was...

617
00:38:14.769 --> 00:38:16.937
You are the one that decided
to climb into this...

618
00:38:17.021 --> 00:38:19.439
The claw, it moves.

619
00:38:24.946 --> 00:38:26.280
I have been chosen!

620
00:38:27.031 --> 00:38:29.992
Farewell, my friends.
I go on to a better place.

621
00:38:30.618 --> 00:38:32.411
Gotcha!

622
00:38:34.164 --> 00:38:37.207
A Buzz Lightyear?
No way!

623
00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.184
Yes!

624
00:38:55.268 --> 00:38:57.102
Buzz! No!

625
00:38:58.688 --> 00:38:59.813
Hey!

626
00:39:02.317 --> 00:39:03.358
He has been chosen!

627
00:39:03.443 --> 00:39:05.068
-He must go.
-Hey!

628
00:39:05.153 --> 00:39:06.695
-What are you doing?
-Do not fight the claw.

629
00:39:06.779 --> 00:39:08.906
Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!

630
00:39:12.452 --> 00:39:15.204
All right!
Double prizes!

631
00:39:17.916 --> 00:39:20.500
Let's go home and... play.

632
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:37.017
Sheriff, I can see
your dwelling from here.

633
00:39:37.101 --> 00:39:39.228
-You're almost home.
-Nirvana is coming.

634
00:39:39.312 --> 00:39:41.897
-The mystic portal awaits.
-Will you be quiet?

635
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:43.440
You guys don't get it, do you?

636
00:39:43.524 --> 00:39:46.818
Once we go into Sid's house,
we won't be coming out.

637
00:39:47.362 --> 00:39:49.363
Whoa, Scud! Hey, boy!

638
00:39:49.447 --> 00:39:51.490
Sit! Good boy.

639
00:39:51.574 --> 00:39:54.368
-Hey, I got something for you, boy.
-Freeze!

640
00:39:56.871 --> 00:39:59.039
Ready, set, now!

641
00:40:00.416 --> 00:40:02.918
Hannah!
Hey, Hannah!

642
00:40:03.169 --> 00:40:05.128
-What?
-Did I get my package in the mail?

643
00:40:05.213 --> 00:40:07.631
-I don't know.
-What do you mean you don't know?

644
00:40:07.715 --> 00:40:09.508
I don't know!

645
00:40:10.343 --> 00:40:13.303
-Oh, no, Hannah! Look, Janie!
-What? Hey!

646
00:40:13.388 --> 00:40:15.180
-She's sick!
-No, she's not!

647
00:40:15.265 --> 00:40:17.724
I'll have to perform
one of my operations.

648
00:40:17.809 --> 00:40:20.435
-No!
-No, not Sid's room. Not there.

649
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.396
Hey, give her back!

650
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.314
Sid! Sid!

651
00:40:25.233 --> 00:40:28.527
Oh, no, we have
a sick patient here, nurse.

652
00:40:28.611 --> 00:40:30.570
Prepare the OR, stat!

653
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.908
Patient is... prepped.

654
00:40:35.743 --> 00:40:40.497
No one's ever attempted a double
bypass brain transplant before.

655
00:40:41.582 --> 00:40:44.334
Now for the tricky part.
Pliers!

656
00:40:44.419 --> 00:40:47.212
I don't believe that man's
ever been to medical school.

657
00:40:49.173 --> 00:40:51.842
Doctor, you've done it!

658
00:40:53.094 --> 00:40:54.511
Hannah!

659
00:40:55.179 --> 00:40:56.596
Janie's all better now.

660
00:40:57.765 --> 00:41:01.310
-Mom! Mom!
-She's lying!

661
00:41:01.394 --> 00:41:04.021
Whatever she says,
it's not true!

662
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:19.202
We are gonna die.
I'm outta here!

663
00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:25.500
Locked.

664
00:41:25.585 --> 00:41:27.794
There's gotta be another way
outta here.

665
00:41:39.974 --> 00:41:42.267
Buzz? Was that you?

666
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:54.321
Hey, hi there, little fella.

667
00:41:54.405 --> 00:41:57.824
Come out here.
Do you know a way outta here?

668
00:42:27.855 --> 00:42:29.606
Buzz!

669
00:42:41.035 --> 00:42:43.036
They're cannibals.

670
00:42:46.207 --> 00:42:47.374
Mayday, mayday.

671
00:42:47.458 --> 00:42:49.709
Come in, Star Command.
Send reinforcements.

672
00:42:49.794 --> 00:42:52.129
Star Command, do you copy?

673
00:42:52.547 --> 00:42:54.965
I've set my laser from stun to kill.

674
00:42:55.049 --> 00:42:59.219
Great. Great. Yeah, and if anyone
attacks us, we can blink 'em to death.

675
00:43:02.723 --> 00:43:04.766
Hey, you guys,
I think I found him!

676
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:07.561
Buzz, is that you?

677
00:43:07.645 --> 00:43:09.646
Whiskers, will you
get outta here!

678
00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.607
You're interfering
with the search and rescue!

679
00:43:14.068 --> 00:43:15.902
Look, they're home.

680
00:43:21.075 --> 00:43:22.659
Mom, have you seen Woody?

681
00:43:22.743 --> 00:43:24.327
Where was the last place
you left him?

682
00:43:24.412 --> 00:43:25.662
Right here in the van.

683
00:43:25.746 --> 00:43:28.415
Oh, I'm sure he's there.
You're just not looking hard enough.

684
00:43:28.499 --> 00:43:31.001
He's not here, Mom.
Woody's gone.

685
00:43:32.253 --> 00:43:33.462
Woody's gone?

686
00:43:33.546 --> 00:43:35.505
Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away.

687
00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.674
Huh? Huh?
I told you he was guilty.

688
00:43:37.758 --> 00:43:42.012
Who would've thought he was
capable of such atrocities?

689
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:46.308
Oh, Slink,
I hope he's okay.

690
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:54.357
Oh, a survivor.
Where's the rebel base? Talk!

691
00:43:56.777 --> 00:43:59.321
I can see your will is strong.

692
00:44:00.698 --> 00:44:04.117
Well, we have ways
of making you talk.

693
00:44:13.836 --> 00:44:17.047
Where are your rebel friends now?

694
00:44:17.798 --> 00:44:20.050
Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready!

695
00:44:20.134 --> 00:44:21.760
All right!

696
00:44:33.564 --> 00:44:36.066
Are you all right?
I'm proud of you, Sheriff.

697
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:38.818
A lesser man would've talked
under such torture.

698
00:44:39.612 --> 00:44:41.905
I sure hope this isn't permanent.

699
00:44:41.989 --> 00:44:45.242
Still no word from Star Command.
We're not that far from the space port.

700
00:44:45.326 --> 00:44:47.744
The door. It's open!
We're free!

701
00:44:47.828 --> 00:44:48.954
Woody, we don't know
what's out there!

702
00:44:49.038 --> 00:44:50.330
I'll tell you wha...

703
00:44:52.583 --> 00:44:54.793
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!
Do something quick!

704
00:44:54.877 --> 00:44:56.711
Shield your eyes.

705
00:44:58.673 --> 00:45:01.508
It's not working. I recharged it
before I left. It should be good for...

706
00:45:01.592 --> 00:45:05.220
You idiot! You're a toy!
Use your karate chop action!

707
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.014
-Get away!
-Hey! Hey! How're you doin' that?

708
00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:10.934
-Stop that.
-Back! Back, you savages! Back!

709
00:45:11.018 --> 00:45:14.729
-Woody, stop it!
-Sorry, guys, but dinner's cancelled!

710
00:45:15.064 --> 00:45:17.649
There's no place like home!
There's no place like home!

711
00:45:18.526 --> 00:45:20.193
There's no place like home.

712
00:45:34.417 --> 00:45:36.751
Another stunt like that, cowboy,
you're gonna get us killed.

713
00:45:36.836 --> 00:45:39.212
Don't tell me what to do.

714
00:45:58.566 --> 00:46:02.027
Yee-haw! Giddyap, pardner!

715
00:46:02.111 --> 00:46:04.904
We got to get this wagon train
a-movin'!

716
00:46:07.742 --> 00:46:09.034
Split up!

717
00:46:31.265 --> 00:46:33.558
Calling Buzz Lightyear.
Come in, Buzz Lightyear.

718
00:46:34.101 --> 00:46:35.769
-This is Star Command.
-Star Command!

719
00:46:35.853 --> 00:46:38.355
-Buzz Lightyear, do you read me?
-Buzz Lightyear responding.

720
00:46:38.439 --> 00:46:39.522
Read you loud and clear.

721
00:46:39.607 --> 00:46:42.108
Buzz Lightyear,
planet Earth needs your help.

722
00:46:42.193 --> 00:46:44.361
-On the way!
-Buzz Lightyear!

723
00:46:44.445 --> 00:46:48.948
The world's greatest superhero!
Now the world's greatest toy!

724
00:46:49.033 --> 00:46:51.993
Buzz has it all!
Locking wrist communicator!

725
00:46:52.078 --> 00:46:54.537
-Calling Buzz Lightyear!
-Karate chop action!

726
00:46:54.622 --> 00:46:56.623
-Wow!
-Pulsating laser light!

727
00:46:56.707 --> 00:47:00.085
-Total annihilation!
-Multi-phrase voice simulator!

728
00:47:00.169 --> 00:47:02.295
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

729
00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.214
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space.

730
00:47:04.298 --> 00:47:07.550
And best of all,
high pressure space wings!

731
00:47:07.635 --> 00:47:11.346
-To infinity and beyond!
-Not a flying toy.

732
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.056
Get your Buzz Lightyear action figure

733
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:16.393
-and save a galaxy near you!
-Buzz Lightyear!

734
00:47:16.477 --> 00:47:19.979
Available at all Al's Toy Barn outlets
in the tri-county area.

735
00:47:21.315 --> 00:47:24.359
And welcome back to the Point
Richmond Bowling Championship.

736
00:47:27.446 --> 00:47:31.783
Out among the stars I sail

737
00:47:31.867 --> 00:47:34.577
Way beyond the moon

738
00:47:36.247 --> 00:47:40.625
In my silver ship I sailed

739
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:44.838
To a dream
that ended too soon

740
00:47:44.922 --> 00:47:47.757
Now I know exactly

741
00:47:47.842 --> 00:47:51.344
Who I am and what I'm here for

742
00:47:51.429 --> 00:47:54.848
You are a toy! You can't fly!

743
00:47:56.684 --> 00:48:01.187
And I will go sailing

744
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:04.899
No more

745
00:48:09.572 --> 00:48:13.533
But no, it can't be true

746
00:48:13.617 --> 00:48:16.786
I could fly if I wanted to

747
00:48:16.871 --> 00:48:19.581
Like a bird in the sky

748
00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:22.500
If I believed I could fly

749
00:48:22.585 --> 00:48:25.211
Why, I'd fly

750
00:48:25.296 --> 00:48:28.089
To infinity and beyond!

751
00:48:43.898 --> 00:48:47.650
Clearly, I

752
00:48:47.735 --> 00:48:52.447
Will go sailing

753
00:48:52.531 --> 00:48:55.116
No more

754
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.674
Mom! Mom, have you seen
my Sally doll?

755
00:49:12.384 --> 00:49:14.594
What, dear? What was that?

756
00:49:15.179 --> 00:49:17.305
Never mind!

757
00:49:24.605 --> 00:49:27.440
Buzz, the coast is clear.
Buzz, where are you?

758
00:49:27.525 --> 00:49:31.027
There's a secret mission
in uncharted space. Let's go.

759
00:49:31.111 --> 00:49:34.447
Really?
That is so interesting.

760
00:49:35.699 --> 00:49:38.159
Would you like some tea,
Mrs Nesbitt?

761
00:49:38.786 --> 00:49:39.786
Buzz!

762
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.747
It's so nice you could join us
on such late notice.

763
00:49:42.832 --> 00:49:46.417
-Oh, no!
-What a lovely hat, Mrs Nesbitt.

764
00:49:46.502 --> 00:49:48.670
It goes quite well with your head.

765
00:49:49.588 --> 00:49:52.048
Hannah! Oh, Hannah!

766
00:49:52.132 --> 00:49:54.884
Mom? Please excuse me, ladies.

767
00:49:54.969 --> 00:49:56.761
I'll be right back.

768
00:49:59.515 --> 00:50:03.560
What is it, Mom?
Mom, where are you?

769
00:50:03.644 --> 00:50:06.145
Buzz. Hey.
Buzz, are you okay?

770
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:09.399
Gone! It's all gone.

771
00:50:09.483 --> 00:50:12.360
All of it's gone.
Bye-bye. See ya.

772
00:50:12.444 --> 00:50:13.486
What happened to you?

773
00:50:13.571 --> 00:50:16.239
One minute you're defending
the whole galaxy.

774
00:50:16.323 --> 00:50:20.285
And suddenly you find yourself
suckin' down Darfeeling with

775
00:50:20.369 --> 00:50:23.538
Marie Antoinette
and her little sister.

776
00:50:25.457 --> 00:50:27.750
I think you've had
enough tea for today.

777
00:50:27.835 --> 00:50:29.586
Let's get you outta here, Buzz.

778
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.630
Don't you get it?
You see the hat?

779
00:50:32.715 --> 00:50:37.677
-I am Mrs Nesbitt!
-Snap out of it, Buzz!

780
00:50:41.557 --> 00:50:43.766
I'm sorry. I...
You're right.

781
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:46.728
I am just a little depressed.
That's all.

782
00:50:46.812 --> 00:50:48.855
I can get through this.

783
00:50:48.939 --> 00:50:50.732
Oh, I'm a sham!

784
00:50:50.816 --> 00:50:52.108
-Look at me.
-Quiet, Buzz.

785
00:50:52.192 --> 00:50:55.069
I can't even fly out of a window.

786
00:50:55.154 --> 00:50:58.406
The hat looked good?
Tell me the hat looked good.

787
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.284
-The apron is a bit much.
-"Out the window"!

788
00:51:01.368 --> 00:51:03.661
Buzz, you're a genius!

789
00:51:03.746 --> 00:51:05.079
Come on, come on. This way.

790
00:51:05.164 --> 00:51:08.333
Years of academy, training, wasted!

791
00:51:09.543 --> 00:51:10.793
B-3.

792
00:51:10.878 --> 00:51:12.962
Miss! G-6.

793
00:51:13.047 --> 00:51:15.256
You sunk it. Are you peeking?

794
00:51:15.341 --> 00:51:18.635
Oh, quit your whinin' and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.

795
00:51:18.719 --> 00:51:21.179
-Give me the nose. Come on.
-How about three out of five?

796
00:51:22.556 --> 00:51:25.558
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

797
00:51:26.226 --> 00:51:29.312
-Son of a building block. It's Woody.
-He's in the psycho's bedroom.

798
00:51:29.396 --> 00:51:31.814
-Hi!
-Everyone! It's Woody!

799
00:51:31.899 --> 00:51:32.899
-Woody?
-You're kidding!

800
00:51:32.983 --> 00:51:36.110
-Woody?
-We're gonna get outta here, Buzz.

801
00:51:36.612 --> 00:51:37.820
Buzz?

802
00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.285
-Hey, look!
-Woody!

803
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:46.496
Oh, boy, am I glad
to see you guys.

804
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.248
-I knew you'd come back, Woody.
-What are you doin' over there?

805
00:51:49.333 --> 00:51:51.793
It's a long story, Bo.
I'll explain later.

806
00:51:51.877 --> 00:51:53.878
Here! Catch this!

807
00:51:55.005 --> 00:51:57.465
-Whoa! I've got it, Woody.
-He got it, Woody.

808
00:51:57.549 --> 00:52:00.426
Good goin', Slink. Nowjust,
just tie it on to somethin'.

809
00:52:00.511 --> 00:52:03.012
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got
a better idea. How 'bout we don't?

810
00:52:03.097 --> 00:52:04.430
-Hey!
-Potato Head.

811
00:52:04.515 --> 00:52:06.474
Did you all take stupid pills
this morning?

812
00:52:06.558 --> 00:52:08.518
Have you forgotten
what he did to Buzz?

813
00:52:08.602 --> 00:52:10.144
And now you wanna let him
back over here?

814
00:52:10.229 --> 00:52:14.649
No! No, no, no, no, no! You got it...
You got it all wrong, Potato Head.

815
00:52:14.733 --> 00:52:17.068
Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here.
He's with me!

816
00:52:17.152 --> 00:52:20.446
-You are a liar!
-No, I'm not. Buzz, come over here.

817
00:52:20.531 --> 00:52:24.283
Tell the nice toys that you're...
that you're not dead.

818
00:52:27.162 --> 00:52:28.204
Just a sec!

819
00:52:28.288 --> 00:52:31.416
Buzz, will you get up here
and give me a hand?

820
00:52:33.919 --> 00:52:34.919
That's very funny, Buzz.

821
00:52:35.004 --> 00:52:38.089
-This is serious!
-Hey, Woody! Where'd ya go?

822
00:52:38.173 --> 00:52:40.258
He's lying. Buzz ain't there.

823
00:52:40.884 --> 00:52:43.052
Oh! Hi, Buzz!

824
00:52:43.137 --> 00:52:46.222
Why don't you say hello
to the guys over there?

825
00:52:46.306 --> 00:52:50.018
Hiya, fellas!
To infinity and beyond!

826
00:52:50.102 --> 00:52:51.894
Hey, look! It's Buzz!

827
00:52:51.979 --> 00:52:56.899
Hey, Buzz, let's show the guys
our new secret best friends handshake.

828
00:52:56.984 --> 00:52:58.317
Give me five, man!

829
00:52:58.402 --> 00:52:59.569
Something's screwy here.

830
00:52:59.653 --> 00:53:02.530
So you see we're friends now, guys.
Aren't we, Buzz?

831
00:53:02.614 --> 00:53:04.532
You bet. Give me a hug.

832
00:53:05.659 --> 00:53:07.076
Boy, I love you too.

833
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:08.745
See? It is Buzz.

834
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:10.455
Now give back the lights,
Potato Head.

835
00:53:10.539 --> 00:53:11.998
Wait just a minute.

836
00:53:12.082 --> 00:53:14.625
-What are you tryin' to pull?
-Nothing!

837
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.673
-Oh, that is disgusting.
-Murderer!

838
00:53:20.758 --> 00:53:22.842
-No! No, no, no, no, no!
-You murdering dog!

839
00:53:22.926 --> 00:53:25.261
-It's not what you think. I swear!
-Save it for the jury.

840
00:53:25.345 --> 00:53:27.930
I hope Sid pulls
your voice box out, ya creep.

841
00:53:28.015 --> 00:53:29.932
No, no! No, no!
Don't leave! Don't leave!

842
00:53:30.017 --> 00:53:32.977
Ya gotta help us, please! You don't
know what it's like over here!

843
00:53:33.062 --> 00:53:34.395
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

844
00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.106
Go back to your lives, citizens.
Show's over.

845
00:53:37.191 --> 00:53:39.776
Come back! Slink!

846
00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:43.780
Slink! Please!
Please! Listen to me!

847
00:53:43.864 --> 00:53:47.116
No! No! Come back!

848
00:53:47.201 --> 00:53:49.702
Slinky!

849
00:53:58.462 --> 00:54:00.963
Buzz! Go away!

850
00:54:01.048 --> 00:54:02.757
You disgusting freaks!

851
00:54:04.176 --> 00:54:06.511
All right, back!
Back, you cannibals!

852
00:54:11.266 --> 00:54:14.936
He is still alive, and you're
not gonna get him, you monsters!

853
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.813
What are you doin'?

854
00:54:19.733 --> 00:54:21.818
Hey. Hey, they fixed you.

855
00:54:25.405 --> 00:54:26.948
But they're cannibals.

856
00:54:27.032 --> 00:54:29.575
We saw them eat
those other toys.

857
00:54:37.835 --> 00:54:40.461
Sorry. I thought
that you were gonna...

858
00:54:41.296 --> 00:54:43.131
You know, you know, eat my friend.

859
00:54:43.423 --> 00:54:45.299
Hey, no, no, wait, hey!

860
00:54:45.384 --> 00:54:46.801
-What's wrong?
-Sid?

861
00:54:46.885 --> 00:54:48.553
Not now, Mom! I'm busy!

862
00:54:48.637 --> 00:54:51.055
-Sid! Buzz, come on!
-You left that door open.

863
00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:55.560
Get up! Use your legs! Fine!
Let Sid trash you! But don't blame me!

864
00:54:57.855 --> 00:55:01.107
It came!
It finally came!

865
00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:05.945
"The Big One."

866
00:55:08.907 --> 00:55:11.367
"Extremely dangerous.

867
00:55:11.451 --> 00:55:14.162
"Keep out of reach of children."

868
00:55:15.455 --> 00:55:18.708
Cool! What am I gonna blow?

869
00:55:18.792 --> 00:55:21.669
Man. Hey, where's
that wimpy cowboy doll?

870
00:55:36.059 --> 00:55:40.980
Yes. I've always wanted
to put a spaceman into orbit.

871
00:55:50.782 --> 00:55:52.909
Now. Yes.

872
00:55:57.331 --> 00:55:59.290
Oh, no!

873
00:56:01.835 --> 00:56:03.502
Oh, man!

874
00:56:10.177 --> 00:56:11.928
Sid Phillips reporting.

875
00:56:12.012 --> 00:56:13.554
Launch of the shuttle
has been delayed

876
00:56:13.639 --> 00:56:16.307
due to adverse weather
conditions at the launch site.

877
00:56:16.391 --> 00:56:19.268
Tomorrow's forecast, sunny.

878
00:56:20.771 --> 00:56:22.480
Sweet dreams.

879
00:56:27.819 --> 00:56:31.364
I looked everywhere, honey,
but all I could find was your hat.

880
00:56:31.448 --> 00:56:33.616
But what if we
leave them behind?

881
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.451
Oh, don't worry, honey.

882
00:56:35.535 --> 00:56:38.955
I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz
before we leave tomorrow.

883
00:56:47.381 --> 00:56:48.547
I need air!

884
00:56:49.216 --> 00:56:50.716
Will you quit movin' around?

885
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:54.428
I'm sorry. It's just that I get...
I get so nervous before I travel.

886
00:56:54.513 --> 00:56:56.931
How did I get stuck
with you as a moving buddy?

887
00:56:57.015 --> 00:56:59.183
Everyone else was picked.

888
00:57:05.899 --> 00:57:07.275
Oh, Woody.

889
00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:12.196
If only you could see
how much Andy misses you.

890
00:57:26.336 --> 00:57:27.837
Hey, Buzz!

891
00:57:34.428 --> 00:57:38.264
Hey. Get over here and see if
you can get this toolbox off me.

892
00:57:40.976 --> 00:57:43.811
Oh, come on, Buzz, I...

893
00:57:43.895 --> 00:57:48.024
Buzz, I can't do this without you.
I need your help.

894
00:57:49.693 --> 00:57:52.903
I can't help.
I can't help anyone.

895
00:57:52.988 --> 00:57:55.865
Why, sure you can, Buzz.
You can get me outta here.

896
00:57:55.949 --> 00:57:59.285
Then I'll get that rocket off you, and
we'll make a break for Andy's house.

897
00:57:59.369 --> 00:58:02.872
Andy's house, Sid's house.
What's the difference?

898
00:58:02.956 --> 00:58:07.043
Oh, Buzz. You've had a big fall.
You must not be thinking clearly.

899
00:58:07.127 --> 00:58:10.588
No, Woody. For the first time
I am thinking clearly.

900
00:58:10.672 --> 00:58:13.341
You were right all along.
I'm not a Space Ranger.

901
00:58:13.425 --> 00:58:17.636
I'm just a toy, a stupid,
little, insignificant toy.

902
00:58:17.721 --> 00:58:18.971
Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

903
00:58:19.056 --> 00:58:22.475
Bein' a toy is a lot better
than bein' a, a Space Ranger.

904
00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:24.894
-Yeah, right.
-No, it is.

905
00:58:24.978 --> 00:58:28.022
Look, over in that house is a kid
who thinks you are the greatest.

906
00:58:28.106 --> 00:58:30.775
And it's not because
you're a Space Ranger, pal.

907
00:58:30.859 --> 00:58:34.737
It's because you're a toy.
You are his toy.

908
00:58:34.821 --> 00:58:36.405
But why would Andy want me?

909
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:41.786
Why would Andy want you?
Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear.

910
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:44.580
Any other toy would give up
his moving parts just to be you.

911
00:58:44.664 --> 00:58:48.209
You've got wings.
You glow in the dark. You talk!

912
00:58:48.293 --> 00:58:51.670
Your helmet does
that, that, that whoosh thing.

913
00:58:52.255 --> 00:58:54.840
You are a cool toy.

914
00:58:58.345 --> 00:59:01.180
As a matter of fact,
you're too cool.

915
00:59:01.765 --> 00:59:05.017
I mean, I mean, what chance
does a toy like me have

916
00:59:05.102 --> 00:59:08.396
against a Buzz Lightyear
action figure?

917
00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.065
All I can do is...

918
00:59:11.149 --> 00:59:15.569
There's a snake in my boots.

919
00:59:15.654 --> 00:59:17.947
Why would Andy ever want
to play with me

920
00:59:18.031 --> 00:59:20.741
when he's got you?

921
00:59:21.535 --> 00:59:25.204
I'm the one that should be
strapped to that rocket.

922
00:59:47.978 --> 00:59:51.063
Listen, Buzz, forget about me.

923
00:59:51.148 --> 00:59:54.066
You should get outta here
while you can.

924
01:00:05.495 --> 01:00:07.371
Buzz? What are you doin'?
I thought you were...

925
01:00:07.456 --> 01:00:10.499
Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid
over in that house who needs us.

926
01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:12.543
Now let's get
you out of this thing.

927
01:00:12.627 --> 01:00:14.003
Yes, sir!

928
01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:18.716
Come on, Buzz.
We can do it.

929
01:00:24.764 --> 01:00:26.515
Woody, it's the moving van.

930
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.767
We gotta get outta here now.

931
01:00:33.607 --> 01:00:35.232
Come on, Buzz.

932
01:00:36.818 --> 01:00:38.027
All right.

933
01:00:39.488 --> 01:00:42.281
-Hey, I'm out!
-Almost there.

934
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:49.622
I want to ride the pony.

935
01:00:53.793 --> 01:00:57.338
Woody? Woody?
Are you all right?

936
01:00:58.215 --> 01:01:00.799
I'm fine. I'm okay.

937
01:01:11.353 --> 01:01:14.813
Oh, yeah!
Time for lift-off!

938
01:01:17.776 --> 01:01:20.653
To infinity and beyond!

939
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:31.872
Back, back.

940
01:01:31.957 --> 01:01:33.707
Down, down!

941
01:01:34.376 --> 01:01:36.460
Okay, what do I do?
Come on, Woody. Think.

942
01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:40.839
Guys!

943
01:01:42.551 --> 01:01:45.094
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Wait. Listen, please.

944
01:01:45.178 --> 01:01:46.512
There's a good toy down there,

945
01:01:46.596 --> 01:01:49.723
and he's gonna be blown
to bits in a few minutes.

946
01:01:49.808 --> 01:01:53.352
All because of me.
We gotta save him.

947
01:01:53.436 --> 01:01:56.188
And...
But I need your help.

948
01:02:03.446 --> 01:02:06.240
Please. He's my friend.

949
01:02:07.284 --> 01:02:09.660
And he's the only one I've got.

950
01:02:22.882 --> 01:02:26.552
Thank you.
Okay, I think I know what to do.

951
01:02:26.636 --> 01:02:28.721
We're gonna have
to break a few rules.

952
01:02:28.805 --> 01:02:31.932
But if it works,
it'll help everybody.

953
01:02:42.819 --> 01:02:45.613
Houston to Mission Control.
Come in, Control.

954
01:02:45.905 --> 01:02:49.074
Launch pad is being constructed.

955
01:02:50.785 --> 01:02:51.994
All right, listen up.

956
01:02:52.078 --> 01:02:54.872
I need Pump Boy here,
Ducky here.

957
01:02:54.956 --> 01:02:57.666
Legs, you're with Ducky.

958
01:02:58.418 --> 01:03:01.086
RollerBob and I don't move
'til we get the signal. Clear?

959
01:03:02.255 --> 01:03:04.632
Okay. Let's move!

960
01:03:25.528 --> 01:03:26.654
Wind the frog.

961
01:03:48.843 --> 01:03:50.969
Wait for the signal.

962
01:04:06.361 --> 01:04:07.861
Go!

963
01:04:11.491 --> 01:04:13.325
All right, let's go!

964
01:04:13.827 --> 01:04:15.369
I'll get it!

965
01:04:15.453 --> 01:04:16.662
Now!

966
01:04:17.372 --> 01:04:19.164
I'm coming. I'm coming.

967
01:04:29.175 --> 01:04:30.509
Scud!

968
01:04:34.681 --> 01:04:36.348
Stupid dog.

969
01:04:44.107 --> 01:04:45.649
Lean back!

970
01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:53.991
Mission Control, is the
launch pad construction complete?

971
01:04:54.075 --> 01:04:56.618
Roger. Rocket is now
secured to guide wire.

972
01:04:56.703 --> 01:05:00.289
We are currently obtaining
the ignition sticks.

973
01:05:00.373 --> 01:05:02.124
Countdown will commence
momentarily.

974
01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:04.460
-Stand by.
-Let's go.

975
01:05:04.544 --> 01:05:08.797
Hey, Ma! Where are the matches?
Oh, wait. Here they are. Never mind.

976
01:05:08.882 --> 01:05:11.341
Woody! Great!
Help me outta this thing.

977
01:05:11.885 --> 01:05:15.304
-What?
-It's okay. Everything's under control.

978
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:18.056
Woody, what are you doing?

979
01:05:18.141 --> 01:05:22.394
Houston. All systems are go.
Requesting permission to launch...

980
01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:25.773
Hey? How'd you get out here?

981
01:05:27.442 --> 01:05:30.486
Oh, well. You and I
can have a cookout later.

982
01:05:34.073 --> 01:05:36.533
Houston, do we have
permission to launch?

983
01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:39.119
Roger. Permission granted.

984
01:05:39.204 --> 01:05:43.332
You are confirmed
at "T" minus ten seconds.

985
01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:47.169
And counting.
Ten, nine,

986
01:05:47.253 --> 01:05:50.005
eight, seven, six,

987
01:05:50.089 --> 01:05:53.217
five, four, three, two,

988
01:05:53.301 --> 01:05:57.429
-one!
-Reach for the sky!

989
01:05:58.848 --> 01:06:02.309
This town ain't big enough
for the two of us.

990
01:06:02.393 --> 01:06:03.685
What?

991
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:06.355
Somebody's poisoned the water hole.

992
01:06:06.439 --> 01:06:10.442
-It's busted.
-Who are you callin' busted, buster?

993
01:06:11.402 --> 01:06:12.528
That's right.

994
01:06:12.612 --> 01:06:16.323
I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips.

995
01:06:16.407 --> 01:06:19.201
We don't like bein' blown up, Sid,

996
01:06:19.285 --> 01:06:21.245
or smashed or ripped apart.

997
01:06:21.329 --> 01:06:24.790
-"We"?
-That's right! Your toys!

998
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.125
Mama!

999
01:06:27.627 --> 01:06:28.961
Mama!

1000
01:06:29.546 --> 01:06:32.631
Mama! Mama!

1001
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:55.737
Mama!

1002
01:06:56.656 --> 01:07:00.868
From now on, you must take
good care of your toys!

1003
01:07:00.952 --> 01:07:05.038
Because if you don't,
we'll find out, Sid.

1004
01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:11.461
We toys can see everything.

1005
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:15.007
So play nice.

1006
01:07:21.264 --> 01:07:24.808
We did it! We did it! Yes!

1007
01:07:24.893 --> 01:07:27.519
The toys!
The toys are alive!

1008
01:07:27.812 --> 01:07:29.271
Nice toy.

1009
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:34.443
What's wrong, Sid?

1010
01:07:34.527 --> 01:07:37.279
Don't you want to play with Sally?

1011
01:07:38.406 --> 01:07:40.616
Nice work, fellows.
Good job.

1012
01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.285
Comin' out of the ground, what a touch.
That was a stroke of genius.

1013
01:07:43.369 --> 01:07:45.078
Woody.

1014
01:07:46.539 --> 01:07:47.873
Thanks.

1015
01:07:49.667 --> 01:07:51.460
Everybody say, "Bye, house!"

1016
01:07:51.544 --> 01:07:53.837
-Woody! The van!
-Bye, house.

1017
01:07:56.758 --> 01:07:58.425
We gotta run! Thanks, guys!

1018
01:08:01.971 --> 01:08:03.221
Quick!

1019
01:08:08.353 --> 01:08:10.312
Just go. I'll catch up.

1020
01:08:31.668 --> 01:08:32.918
Come on!

1021
01:08:48.434 --> 01:08:50.268
You can do it, Woody!

1022
01:08:52.522 --> 01:08:54.272
I got it!

1023
01:08:54.983 --> 01:08:56.441
I made it.

1024
01:09:00.863 --> 01:09:03.865
Get away,
you stupid dog! Down!

1025
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:06.535
-Down!
-Hold on, Woody!

1026
01:09:07.787 --> 01:09:10.205
I can't do it.

1027
01:09:11.249 --> 01:09:13.625
Take care ofAndy for me!

1028
01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:15.252
No!

1029
01:09:16.629 --> 01:09:18.046
Buzz!

1030
01:09:45.324 --> 01:09:46.408
Are we there already?

1031
01:09:46.492 --> 01:09:48.076
-Woody?
-How did you...?

1032
01:09:48.161 --> 01:09:49.453
-How'd he get here?
-Where have you...?

1033
01:09:49.537 --> 01:09:50.787
What happened?

1034
01:09:50.872 --> 01:09:52.998
-What's goin' on?
-What's he takin'?

1035
01:09:53.833 --> 01:09:55.125
There you are!

1036
01:09:55.209 --> 01:09:57.085
Hey. What's he doing?

1037
01:10:00.173 --> 01:10:01.923
He's at it again!

1038
01:10:13.352 --> 01:10:15.520
-Get him!
-Come on!

1039
01:10:24.363 --> 01:10:25.655
No, no!

1040
01:10:29.452 --> 01:10:31.703
No, no, no, no! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1041
01:10:39.879 --> 01:10:41.588
Pig pile!

1042
01:11:03.653 --> 01:11:05.987
-Get outta that car!
-Move it!

1043
01:11:08.199 --> 01:11:10.158
No! Please!
You don't understand!

1044
01:11:10.243 --> 01:11:12.285
Buzz is out there.
We gotta help him.

1045
01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:14.704
-No!
-Toss him overboard!

1046
01:11:14.789 --> 01:11:16.540
No, no, no! Wait!

1047
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.545
-Hooray!
-So long, Woody!

1048
01:11:27.093 --> 01:11:28.718
Oh! Woody!

1049
01:11:29.095 --> 01:11:32.097
-Oh! Well, thanks for the ride.
-Look out!

1050
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:38.228
Now let's catch up
to that truck.

1051
01:11:45.611 --> 01:11:48.238
Guys! Guys! Woody's riding R.C.

1052
01:11:48.322 --> 01:11:50.448
-What?
-And Buzz is with him!

1053
01:11:54.745 --> 01:11:55.871
It is Buzz!

1054
01:11:55.955 --> 01:11:57.956
Woody was telling the truth.

1055
01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.418
-What have we done?
-Great! Now I have guilt.

1056
01:12:01.502 --> 01:12:03.628
We're almost there!

1057
01:12:04.839 --> 01:12:07.048
Rocky, the ramp!

1058
01:12:14.807 --> 01:12:16.183
Look out!

1059
01:12:16.976 --> 01:12:19.352
Quick! Hold onto my tail!

1060
01:12:24.483 --> 01:12:29.487
-Attaboy, Slink!
-Oh! Woody!

1061
01:12:29.947 --> 01:12:30.906
Woody! Speed up!

1062
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:32.908
-Speed up!
-The batteries!

1063
01:12:32.992 --> 01:12:34.659
They're runnin' out!

1064
01:12:50.676 --> 01:12:54.971
-I can't hold on much longer.
-Slink! Hang on!

1065
01:13:10.738 --> 01:13:11.988
Great!

1066
01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:16.660
Woody! The rocket!

1067
01:13:16.744 --> 01:13:19.287
The match! Yes!

1068
01:13:19.372 --> 01:13:21.248
Thank you, Sid!

1069
01:13:28.381 --> 01:13:30.465
No! No, no! No!

1070
01:13:30.549 --> 01:13:34.052
No! Oh, no!

1071
01:13:34.136 --> 01:13:37.973
No, no, no, no, no,

1072
01:13:38.057 --> 01:13:39.808
no!

1073
01:13:39.892 --> 01:13:41.601
No!

1074
01:13:50.569 --> 01:13:53.738
-Woody! What are you doing?
-Hold still, Buzz!

1075
01:13:56.367 --> 01:13:57.492
You did it!

1076
01:13:57.868 --> 01:13:59.452
Next stop, Andy!

1077
01:13:59.537 --> 01:14:03.623
Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket.
Rockets explode!

1078
01:14:14.218 --> 01:14:16.678
I should have held on longer.

1079
01:14:16.762 --> 01:14:19.889
Look! Look! It's Woody
and Buzz comin' up fast!

1080
01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:22.392
Woody!

1081
01:14:31.402 --> 01:14:32.861
Take cover!

1082
01:14:40.161 --> 01:14:42.287
This is the part
where we blow up!

1083
01:14:42.371 --> 01:14:43.788
Not today!

1084
01:14:55.343 --> 01:14:57.552
Hey, Buzz!
You're flyin'!

1085
01:14:57.636 --> 01:15:00.930
This isn't flying.
This is falling with style.

1086
01:15:03.809 --> 01:15:07.896
To infinity and beyond!

1087
01:15:14.111 --> 01:15:16.154
Buzz, we missed the truck.

1088
01:15:16.238 --> 01:15:18.323
We're not aiming for the truck.

1089
01:15:25.081 --> 01:15:26.081
Hey, wow!

1090
01:15:26.165 --> 01:15:28.375
-What? What is it?
-Woody! Buzz!

1091
01:15:28.459 --> 01:15:30.460
Oh, great, you found them.
Where were they?

1092
01:15:30.544 --> 01:15:32.629
-Here in the car!
-See?

1093
01:15:32.713 --> 01:15:36.007
Now, what'd I tell you?
Right where you left 'em.

1094
01:15:44.683 --> 01:15:48.269
-Which one can I open first?
-Let's let Molly open one.

1095
01:15:54.151 --> 01:15:55.443
Frankincense, this is Myrrh.

1096
01:15:55.528 --> 01:15:57.862
Hey, heads up, everybody.
It's show time.

1097
01:15:57.947 --> 01:15:59.823
Whoa! It's time!

1098
01:16:01.867 --> 01:16:03.284
Oh, Bo.

1099
01:16:03.369 --> 01:16:05.787
There's got to be a less painful way
to get my attention.

1100
01:16:05.871 --> 01:16:07.956
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

1101
01:16:09.083 --> 01:16:11.501
Say, isn't that mistletoe?

1102
01:16:14.004 --> 01:16:17.507
Maybe Andy will get another dinosaur.
Like a leaf eater.

1103
01:16:17.591 --> 01:16:20.969
That way I could play
the dominant predator.

1104
01:16:21.053 --> 01:16:22.095
Quiet, everyone! Quiet!

1105
01:16:22.179 --> 01:16:25.849
Molly's first present
is Mrs Potato Head.

1106
01:16:25.933 --> 01:16:27.976
Repeat, a Mrs Potato Head.

1107
01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:30.145
Way to go, Idaho!

1108
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:32.272
Gee, I'd better shave.

1109
01:16:36.986 --> 01:16:38.361
Come in, Frankincense.

1110
01:16:38.446 --> 01:16:40.447
Andy is now opening
his first present.

1111
01:16:40.531 --> 01:16:43.324
-It's...
-Buzz. Buzz Lightyear,

1112
01:16:43.409 --> 01:16:45.368
-you are not worried, are you?
-I can't quite...

1113
01:16:45.453 --> 01:16:46.870
-Me? No, no.
-Make out...

1114
01:16:46.954 --> 01:16:49.622
No. No, no, no, no.

1115
01:16:49.707 --> 01:16:52.041
A large box... It's...

1116
01:16:52.126 --> 01:16:54.711
-Are you?
-Now, Buzz,

1117
01:16:54.795 --> 01:16:59.048
what could Andy possibly get
that is worse than you?

1118
01:17:00.426 --> 01:17:02.135
Oh, what is it? What is it?

1119
01:17:02.219 --> 01:17:04.137
Wow! A puppy!

1120
01:17:19.195 --> 01:17:22.447
You've got a friend in me

1121
01:17:23.741 --> 01:17:26.784
You've got a friend in me

1122
01:17:27.995 --> 01:17:31.164
When the road looks rough ahead

1123
01:17:31.248 --> 01:17:36.085
And you're miles and miles
from your nice, warm bed

1124
01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:39.589
You just remember
what your old pal said

1125
01:17:39.673 --> 01:17:42.467
Boy, you've got a friend in me

1126
01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:47.639
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

1127
01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.022
You've got a friend in me

1128
01:17:57.233 --> 01:17:59.817
You've got a friend in me

1129
01:18:01.487 --> 01:18:05.531
-You got troubles
-And I got 'em too

1130
01:18:05.616 --> 01:18:09.661
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you

1131
01:18:09.745 --> 01:18:12.747
If we stick together
we can see it through

1132
01:18:12.831 --> 01:18:16.167
'Cause you've got a friend in me

1133
01:18:18.003 --> 01:18:20.546
You've got a friend in me

1134
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:26.344
Some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

1135
01:18:26.428 --> 01:18:29.430
Bigger and stronger too

1136
01:18:29.515 --> 01:18:30.598
Maybe

1137
01:18:30.683 --> 01:18:36.312
But none of them will ever love you
the way I do

1138
01:18:36.397 --> 01:18:38.982
It's me and you, boy

1139
01:18:39.066 --> 01:18:42.485
And as the years go by

1140
01:18:42.569 --> 01:18:45.655
Our friendship will never die

1141
01:18:47.199 --> 01:18:52.036
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1142
01:18:52.121 --> 01:18:56.082
You've got a friend in me

1143
01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:58.710
You've got a friend in me

1144
01:19:00.379 --> 01:19:10.379
You've got a friend in me
