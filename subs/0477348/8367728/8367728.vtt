00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:41.869
I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.

2
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:43.996
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.711
My grandfather was a lawman.
Father, too.

4
00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:50.498
Me and him was sheriffs
at the same time,

5
00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:53.376
him up in Plano and me out here.

6
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.508
I think he's pretty proud of that.

7
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.381
I know [ was.

8
00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.139
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

9
00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.054
A lot of folks find that hard to believe.

10
00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:08.357
Jim Scarborough never carried one.
That's the younger Jim.

11
00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:12.149
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.

12
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.574
I always liked to hear about
the old-timers.

13
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.322
Never missed a chance to do so.

14
00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:24.282
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

15
00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:28.119
Can't help but wonder how
they'd have operated these times.

16
00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.420
There's this boy
I sent to the electric chair

17
00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.090
at Huntsville here a while back.

18
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.043
My arrest and my testimony.

19
00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.223
He killed a 14-year-old girl.

20
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.768
Paper said it was a crime of passion,

21
00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:46.642
but he told me
there wasn't any passion to It.

22
00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:49.099
Told me he'd been planning
to kill somebody

23
00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:50.899
for about as long
as he could remember.

24
00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:53.944
Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.

25
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.614
Said he knew he was going to hell.

26
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.864
Be there in about 15 minutes.
I don't know what to make of that.

27
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.905
I sure do don't.

28
00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:09.452
The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.

29
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.755
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

30
00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:18.511
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

31
00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:22.090
But I don't want
to push my chips forward

32
00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:26.052
and go out and meet something
I don't understand.

33
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:33.021
Man would have
to put his soul at hazard.

34
00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.695
He'd have to say, "Okay.

35
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.159
"I'll be part of this world.”

36
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.323
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

37
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.499
Sheriff, he had some sort
of thing on him,

38
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:53.204
like a oxygen tank for emphysema
or something

39
00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.585
and a hose that run down his sleeve.

40
00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.338
Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?

41
00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.920
You got me.
Well, you can look at it when you get in.

42
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.254
I'll be down there in a bit.

43
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.761
Yes, sir, I got it under control.

44
00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:46.275
-Howdy. What's this about?
-Step out of the car, please, sir.

45
00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.987
-What is that?
-I need you to step out of the car, sir.

46
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:00.168
-What is that for?
-Would you...

47
00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.795
Would you hold still, please, sir?

48
00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.282
You hold still.

49
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.675
Shit.

50
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.691
I ain't got no water.

51
00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.676
I told you, I ain't got no agua.

52
00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.979
Do you speak English?

53
00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.570
Where's the last guy?

54
00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:18.820
Ultimo hombre. Last man standing.
There must have been one.

55
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.492
Where'd he go?

56
00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.371
I reckon I go out the way I come in.

57
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.296
There ain't no lobos.

58
00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.560
You stopped to watch your backtrack.

59
00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.730
Now shoot my dumb ass.

60
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.572
But if you stop,

61
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.658
you stopped in shade.

62
00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.369
Yeah.

63
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:30.233
-What's in the satchel?
-It's full of money.

64
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:33.285
That'll be the day.

65
00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:36.365
-Where'd you get the pistol?
-At the getting place.

66
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:40.586
-Did you buy that gun?
-No. I found it.

67
00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:45.917
-Llewelyn.
-What? Quit your hollering.

68
00:14:46.552 --> 00:14:48.793
What'd you give for that thing?

69
00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:52.840
Well, you don't need to know
everything, Carla Jean.

70
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.971
I need to know that.

71
00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.392
Keep running that mouth of yours,

72
00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:59.016
I'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

73
00:14:59.107 --> 00:15:00.689
Big talk.

74
00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:02.311
Keep it up.

75
00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.394
Fine. I don't want to know.

76
00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:08.571
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

77
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.361
That'll work.

78
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:26.797
All right.

79
00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:35.307
-Llewelyn?
-Yeah?

80
00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:41.221
-What're you doing, baby?
-I'm going out.

81
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.101
Going where?

82
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:46.310
A little something I forgot to do,
but I'll be back.

83
00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.190
And what're you gonna do?

84
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:52.491
I'm fixing to do something dumber
than hell, but I'm going anyways.

85
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:56.570
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

86
00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.823
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

87
00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:06.045
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

88
00:20:59.175 --> 00:21:02.338
-How much?
-69 cents.

89
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:04.135
And the gas?

90
00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:06.883
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

91
00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:11.517
-What way would that be?
-Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

92
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:16.978
What business is it of yours
where I'm from,

93
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.517
friend-o??

94
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.023
-Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
-You didn't mean nothing?

95
00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.484
I was just passing the time.

96
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:33.327
If you don't want to accept that,
I don't know what else I can do for you.

97
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:39.295
-Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?

98
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:46.961
Is something wrong?

99
00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:48.967
-With what?
-With anything.

100
00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:52.216
Is that what you're asking me?

101
00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:54.518
Is there something wrong with anything?

102
00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:57.939
-Will there be anything else?
-You already asked me that.

103
00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.770
Well, I need to see about closing now.

104
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.525
-See about closing?
-Yes, Sir.

105
00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:08.028
-What time do you close?
-Now. We close now.

106
00:22:08.118 --> 00:22:10.200
"Now" is not a time.
What time do you close?

107
00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:12.745
Generally around dark. At dark.

108
00:22:16.794 --> 00:22:18.831
You don't know
what you're talking about, do you?

109
00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:20.082
Sir?

110
00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:24.632
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

111
00:22:27.429 --> 00:22:29.966
-What time do you go to bed?
-Sir?

112
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:34.142
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?
I said, what time do you go to bed?

113
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:41.774
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

114
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:43.226
I could come back then.

115
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.687
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

116
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:47.442
Yeah, you said that.

117
00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:50.525
Well, I got to close now.

118
00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.986
You live in that house out back?

119
00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:56.038
Yes, I do.

120
00:22:56.125 --> 00:22:58.036
You lived here all your life?

121
00:22:59.128 --> 00:23:03.042
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

122
00:23:05.676 --> 00:23:07.462
You married into it?

123
00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:10.671
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

124
00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:15.133
Raised a family there, in Temple.

125
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:17.764
We come out here about four years ago.

126
00:23:17.855 --> 00:23:19.687
You married into it.

127
00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:21.434
If that's the way you want to put it.

128
00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:25.860
Well, I don't have some way to put it.
That's the way it is.

129
00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:37.371
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

130
00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:41.417
-Sir?
-The most you ever lost on a coin toss.

131
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.997
I don't know. I couldn't say.

132
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.716
Call it.

133
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:51.669
-Call it?
-Yes.

134
00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:53.721
-For what?
-Just call it.

135
00:23:56.393 --> 00:24:00.057
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

136
00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:01.558
You need to call it.

137
00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:05.062
I can't call it for you,
or it wouldn't be fair.

138
00:24:05.402 --> 00:24:08.611
- I didn't put nothing up.
-Yes, you did.

139
00:24:08.697 --> 00:24:12.861
You've been putting it up
your whole life. You just didn't know it.

140
00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:15.660
-You know what date is on this coin?
-No.

141
00:24:15.746 --> 00:24:17.532
19568.

142
00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:22.083
It's been travelling 22 years to get here.
And now it's here.

143
00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:24.752
And it's either heads or tails.

144
00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:26.875
And you have to say. Call it.

145
00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:30.049
Well, look, I need to know
what I stand to win.

146
00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:31.500
Everything.

147
00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:35.555
-How's that?
-You stand to win everything. Call it.

148
00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:41.184
All right.

149
00:24:42.064 --> 00:24:43.520
Heads, then.

150
00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:49.401
Well done.

151
00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:53.030
Don't put it in your pocket, sir.

152
00:24:53.117 --> 00:24:56.200
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

153
00:24:56.954 --> 00:25:00.743
-Where do you want me to put it?
-Anywhere, not in your pocket.

154
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:04.542
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

155
00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.538
Which it is.

156
00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:22.176
Llewelyn?

157
00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:26.439
What the hell?

158
00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:31.023
-The Odessa.
-Why would we go to Odessa?

159
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:34.401
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

160
00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:36.152
Well, how come?

161
00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.200
Look, right now it's midnight, Sunday.

162
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:40.119
The courthouse opens
nine hours from now.

163
00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:42.071
Someone's gonna be calling in
the vehicle number

164
00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.328
on the inspection plate on my truck.

165
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:46.580
And around 9:30, they'll show up here.

166
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:47.910
But for how long do we have to...

167
00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:49.495
Baby, at what point
would you quit bothering

168
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.922
to look for your $2 million?

169
00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:54.959
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

170
00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:57.591
Why don't you try standing in the door
and hollering, "Mama, I'm home"?

171
00:25:57.681 --> 00:25:59.888
-Llewelyn...
-Come on, pack your things.

172
00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:02.842
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

173
00:26:04.188 --> 00:26:07.806
Well, don't fall down apologising.

174
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.732
Baby, things happen.

175
00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:13.269
Come on, I can't take them back.

176
00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:37.543
Mind riding bitch?

177
00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:52.858
This his truck?

178
00:26:57.032 --> 00:26:58.693
Got a screwgie?

179
00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:03.444
Who cut his tires?

180
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:06.281
Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

181
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:10.331
-That is a dead dog.
-Yes, it is.

182
00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:16.624
-Where's the receiver?
-I've got it.

183
00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:20.169
These are some ripe petunias.

184
00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:22.805
Hold this, please.

185
00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:31.806
Want it?

186
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:36.151
You getting anything on this?

187
00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:37.603
Not a bleep.

188
00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:39.693
All right.

189
00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:44.234
Give me that.

190
00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:56.793
-I thought it was a car afire.
-It is a car afire.

191
00:27:56.884 --> 00:28:00.343
Wendell said there's something
in the back country, too.

192
00:28:00.429 --> 00:28:01.544
Step in there.

193
00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:04.221
When's the county gonna start
paying a rental on my horse?

194
00:28:04.308 --> 00:28:06.049
I love you more and more every day.

195
00:28:06.143 --> 00:28:08.009
That's very nice.

196
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:10.435
-Be careful.
-Always am.

197
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.433
-Don't get hurt.
-Never do.

198
00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:14.014
Don't hurt no one.

199
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.561
If you say so.

200
00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:55.473
Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.

201
00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:58.901
Yes, sir. We should've brought wienies.

202
00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:01.945
That look like about a '77 Ford
to you, Wendell?

203
00:29:02.032 --> 00:29:05.241
-It could be.
-I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

204
00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:06.863
The old boy shot by the highway?

205
00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:09.241
Yes, sir. His vehicle.

206
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:14.579
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway,

207
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.707
swapped for his car and now here it is,

208
00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:19.539
and he's swapped again
for God knows what.

209
00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:22.458
That's very linear, Sheriff.

210
00:29:23.637 --> 00:29:26.345
-Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
-Yes, Sir.

211
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.427
-Then there's this other.
-Yup.

212
00:29:31.061 --> 00:29:32.802
You ride Winston.

213
00:29:32.896 --> 00:29:35.684
-You sure?
-Oh, I'm more than sure.

214
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:37.606
If anything happens
to Loretta's horse out here,

215
00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:40.936
I can tell you right now, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

216
00:29:41.863 --> 00:29:44.400
It's the same tire tread
coming back as going.

217
00:29:44.491 --> 00:29:45.981
Made about the same time, too.

218
00:29:46.076 --> 00:29:48.192
You can see the sipes real clear.

219
00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:53.831
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

220
00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:57.167
I know this truck.

221
00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.588
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

222
00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:03.041
-Llewelyn Moss?
-That's the boy.

223
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.798
-You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

224
00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:09.095
I kindly doubt it.

225
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:11.219
OK Corral's just yonder.

226
00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:16.179
Oh, hell's bells, they even shot the dog.

227
00:30:19.026 --> 00:30:21.563
Well, this is just a deal
gone wrong, isn't it?

228
00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.143
Yup.

229
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:25.696
Appears to have been a glitch or two.

230
00:30:29.244 --> 00:30:31.076
What calibres you got there, Sheriff?

231
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:32.574
9 millimetre.

232
00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:36.165
Couple of .45 ACPs.

233
00:30:37.127 --> 00:30:40.495
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

234
00:30:42.841 --> 00:30:45.082
How come you reckon
the coyotes ain't been at them?

235
00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:46.542
I don't know.

236
00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:55.058
Supposedly a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

237
00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:57.352
These boys appear to be managerial.

238
00:30:58.398 --> 00:31:00.730
I think we're looking at
more than one fracas.

239
00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:03.650
Execution here. Wild west over there.

240
00:31:05.322 --> 00:31:07.404
It's that Mexican brown dope.

241
00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:09.732
Oh, these boys is all swole up.

242
00:31:09.826 --> 00:31:12.864
So, this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

243
00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:14.911
Then, whoa, differences and...

244
00:31:15.916 --> 00:31:17.702
You know, might not even
have been no money.

245
00:31:17.793 --> 00:31:19.158
That's possible.

246
00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:22.703
-But you don't believe it?
-No.

247
00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.209
Probably I don't.

248
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:30.385
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, Sheriff?

249
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:35.137
If it ain't, it'll do till the mess gets here.

250
00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:30.372
Yes, sir?

251
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:33.129
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

252
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.588
-Did you go up to his trailer?
-Yes, I did.

253
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:39.890
Well, I'd say he's at work.
Do you want to leave a message?

254
00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:42.468
-Where does he work?
-I can't say.

255
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:46.312
Where does he work?

256
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:50.768
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

257
00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:53.729
Where does he work?

258
00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:56.110
Did you not hear me?

259
00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:59.068
We can't give out no information.

260
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:22.924
Why all the way to Del Rio?

261
00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:25.636
I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

262
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.312
You can't afford one?

263
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:31.392
I don't want to register it.
Look, I'll call you in a couple days.

264
00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:33.352
-Promise?
-Yes, I do.

265
00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:36.189
I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.

266
00:34:36.283 --> 00:34:39.492
Well, I got a good one,
so that ought to even out.

267
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:42.866
Listen, you gotta quit your worrying
so much.

268
00:34:42.956 --> 00:34:44.663
Mama's gonna raise hell.

269
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:46.911
She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

270
00:34:47.002 --> 00:34:49.118
Well, you should be used to that.

271
00:34:49.212 --> 00:34:52.045
I'm used to lots of things.
I work at Wal-Mart.

272
00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:55.170
Not any more, Carla Jean.
You are retired.

273
00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:58.252
-Llewelyn?
-Yes, ma'am?

274
00:34:59.973 --> 00:35:02.180
You are coming back, ain't you?

275
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.717
I shall return.

276
00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.515
Sheriff's Department!

277
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.356
Look at that lock.

278
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:20.483
-We going in?
-Gun out and up.

279
00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:27.285
-What about yours?
-I'm hiding behind you.

280
00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:32.164
Sheriff's Department!

281
00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.824
-I believe they done lit a shuck.
-I believe you're right.

282
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.617
That from the lock?

283
00:36:03.703 --> 00:36:05.410
Probably must be.

284
00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:08.330
-So, when was he here, Sheriff?
-I don't know.

285
00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:11.917
-Now that's aggravating.
-Sheriff?

286
00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.664
Still sweating.

287
00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:16.838
Oh, Sheriff. We just missed him!

288
00:36:18.677 --> 00:36:21.339
We gotta circulate this on radio.

289
00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:23.795
All right.

290
00:36:24.474 --> 00:36:26.385
But what do we circulate?

291
00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:32.013
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

292
00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:37.813
Oh, Sheriff, that's aggravating.

293
00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:39.895
I'm ahead of you there.

294
00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:44.567
You think this boy Moss
has got any notion

295
00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:46.777
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches
that are hunting him?

296
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:48.828
I don't know. He ought to.

297
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:53.742
He's seen the same things I've seen,

298
00:36:53.837 --> 00:36:55.999
and it certainly
made an impression on me.

299
00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:04.385
Take me to a motel.

300
00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:06.884
-Got one in mind?
-Someplace cheap.

301
00:37:08.768 --> 00:37:12.306
-You tell me the option.
-Do what, now?

302
00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:15.765
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

303
00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:21.236
I'm just one person,
so it don't matter the size of the bed.

304
00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:28.572
<i>This is Roberto's Automotive.</i>

305
00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:31.155
I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.

306
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.025
Hello?

307
00:39:32.662 --> 00:39:34.369
Is Llewelyn there?

308
00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:37.368
Llewelyn? No, he ain't.

309
00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:39.874
You expect him?

310
00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:43.374
Now, why would I expect him?
Who is this?

311
00:39:51.848 --> 00:39:53.009
May I help you?

312
00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:56.217
Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans,
shoulder, size 11?

313
00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:57.392
I'll check.

314
00:39:57.478 --> 00:39:59.765
-All right. Y'all sell socks?
-Just white.

315
00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:02.644
Well, white's all I wear. Bathroom?

316
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:30.292
Don't stop.

317
00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:32.218
Just ride me up past those rooms.

318
00:40:32.305 --> 00:40:33.670
What room?

319
00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:37.554
Just drive me around.
I wanna see if someone's here.

320
00:40:45.777 --> 00:40:47.814
Keep going. Don't stop.

321
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:50.896
I don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.

322
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.446
It's all right.

323
00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:56.781
Why don't I just set you down right here
and we won't argue about it?

324
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:59.829
-Take me to another motel.
-Let's just call it square.

325
00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:02.999
Look, you're already in the jackpot,
and I'm trying to get you out of it.

326
00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:05.123
Take me to another motel.

327
00:41:54.554 --> 00:41:56.921
The lab reports from Austin
on that blood by the highway.

328
00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:59.723
-What was the bullet?
-There wasn't no bullet.

329
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:04.178
-Wasn't no bullet?
-Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

330
00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:09.358
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

331
00:42:09.444 --> 00:42:10.525
No, sir.

332
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:14.445
You said entry wound in the forehead,
no exit wound.

333
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:15.693
Yes, sir.

334
00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:17.399
You tell me he shot this boy in the head

335
00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:20.906
and then went digging around in there
with a pocket knife?

336
00:42:20.997 --> 00:42:23.910
-Well, sir, I don't wanna picture that.
- I don't, either.

337
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.207
Can I freshen that there for you, Sheriff?

338
00:42:26.294 --> 00:42:28.877
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

339
00:42:28.963 --> 00:42:32.547
Rangers and the DEA are headed back
out to the scene this morning.

340
00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:34.123
You gonna join 'em?

341
00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:37.214
Any new bodies accumulate out there?

342
00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:41.757
-No, sir.
-Well, then I guess I can skip it.

343
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:58.489
12 gauge. Need shells?

344
00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:00.613
Yeah, double-ought.

345
00:43:00.703 --> 00:43:02.614
Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.

346
00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:04.537
Y'all got camping supplies?

347
00:43:04.624 --> 00:43:06.581
Tent poles.

348
00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:09.625
-You already have the tent?
-Well, something like that.

349
00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:12.500
Well, you give me the model number
on the tent, I can order you the poles.

350
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.799
-Oh, never mind. I want a tent.
-Well, what kind of tent?

351
00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:17.000
The kind with most poles.

352
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.363
-Could I get another room?
-You wanna change rooms?

353
00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.911
No, ma'am, I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

354
00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:47.455
-Another additional?
-Yes, ma'am.

355
00:43:47.542 --> 00:43:49.954
And do you have a map of the rooms?

356
00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:52.911
Well, yeah, we had a sort of one.

357
00:43:54.507 --> 00:43:56.123
Oh, thank you.

358
00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:02.008
How about 387

359
00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:05.807
Well, you can have the one right next
to yours if you want, number 137.

360
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:08.760
- It ain't took.
-No, 38 will be fine.

361
00:44:08.855 --> 00:44:10.641
That's got two double beds.

362
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:48.159
How'd you find that?

363
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:37.436
You shouldn't be doing that.

364
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:40.362
Even a young man like you.

365
00:52:41.533 --> 00:52:42.989
Doing what?

366
00:52:44.078 --> 00:52:45.568
Hitchhiking.

367
00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:52.662
Dangerous.

368
00:53:10.896 --> 00:53:14.355
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

369
00:53:14.441 --> 00:53:17.024
Yes, sir, I know him every which way.

370
00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:20.019
When did you last see him?

371
00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:24.490
November 28th, last year.

372
00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:28.532
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

373
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:33.450
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

374
00:53:33.544 --> 00:53:38.539
I remember dates, names, numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

375
00:53:41.093 --> 00:53:42.925
Got a loose cannon here.

376
00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:46.174
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party is out his product.

377
00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:47.426
Yes, sir.

378
00:53:47.516 --> 00:53:52.056
This account will only give up $1,200
in any 24-hour period.

379
00:53:52.146 --> 00:53:53.978
That's up from $1,000.

380
00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:57.853
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

381
00:53:57.943 --> 00:53:59.229
Okay.

382
00:54:00.195 --> 00:54:03.733
-Just how well do you know Chigurh?
-What do you wanna know?

383
00:54:03.824 --> 00:54:07.158
I just wanna know
your opinion of him, in general.

384
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.328
Just how dangerous is he?

385
00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:13.406
Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

386
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.616
He's bad enough you called me.

387
00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:19.796
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer,
but so what?

388
00:54:19.882 --> 00:54:21.998
There's plenty of them around.

389
00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:24.709
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday,

390
00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:28.762
and two others in that
colossal goat fuck out in the desert.

391
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:31.887
-We can stop that.
-Seem pretty sure of yourself.

392
00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:38.140
You've led something of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr Wells?

393
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:43.103
In all honesty, I can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

394
00:54:45.157 --> 00:54:47.649
- I was wondering...
-Yes?

395
00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:51.027
Could you validate my parking ticket?

396
00:54:53.165 --> 00:54:55.953
An attempt at humour, I suppose?

397
00:54:56.043 --> 00:54:57.454
I'm sorry.

398
00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:06.793
You know, I counted the floors
to this building from the street.

399
00:55:07.554 --> 00:55:09.966
-And?
-There's one missing.

400
00:55:13.101 --> 00:55:14.717
We'll look into it.

401
00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:37.698
One room. One night.

402
00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:40.034
That'll be $26.

403
00:55:40.128 --> 00:55:41.459
All righty.

404
00:55:45.384 --> 00:55:46.795
You on all night?

405
00:55:46.885 --> 00:55:50.048
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

406
00:55:51.557 --> 00:55:53.013
This here's for you.

407
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.967
Now, I ain't asking you
to do anything illegal.

408
00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:57.847
There's someone
who been looking for me.

409
00:55:57.938 --> 00:55:59.303
Not police.

410
00:55:59.398 --> 00:56:01.856
You just call me
if anyone else checks in tonight.

411
00:56:01.942 --> 00:56:04.024
And by anyone,
I mean any swinging dick.

412
00:56:46.612 --> 00:56:48.649
There just ain't no way.

413
01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:29.235
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

414
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.696
I need you to drive me on out of here.

415
01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:40.342
-Why not?
- I don't know, man.

416
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:43.020
Could you have stayed...

417
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.292
Were you in a car accident?

418
01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:10.543
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

419
01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:14.050
Let me see the money.

420
01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.054
Were you in a car accident?

421
01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:21.137
Yeah.

422
01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:24.640
-Okay, give me the money.
-It's right here. Give me the clothes.

423
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.768
Let him hold the money.

424
01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.113
Now give it here.

425
01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.740
Give me that beer, too.

426
01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:47.997
How much?

427
01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.962
Brian, give him the beer.

428
01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:12.386
Just went up.

429
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.462
Any word on those vehicles yet?

430
01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.423
Sheriff, I found out everything
there was to find.

431
01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:20.135
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

432
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.392
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

433
01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.814
Do you want me to see what
I can find out about the Mexican ones?

434
01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:27.643
No. Lord, no.

435
01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:30.816
There's this month's cheques.

436
01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.487
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

437
01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:37.194
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

438
01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:38.653
He's going back out there.

439
01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.284
Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

440
01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:41.990
That's cordial of him.

441
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.746
Can I get you to call Loretta for me,

442
01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:47.670
tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

443
01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.043
Yes, Sheriff.

444
01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:50.965
I'll call her when I get done.

445
01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:53.885
I'd call her now, but if she want me
to come home, I just might.

446
01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:56.884
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

447
01:13:57.475 --> 01:14:00.843
You don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

448
01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:07.266
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

449
01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.228
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

450
01:14:11.322 --> 01:14:14.155
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

451
01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:17.324
Might come to three times
before it's over with.

452
01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.278
Now, what the hell?

453
01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:29.712
Sheriff?

454
01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.920
You looked at your load lately?

455
01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.260
That is a damn outrage.

456
01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.880
One of those tie-downs worked loose.

457
01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:41.012
How many bodies did you leave with?

458
01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:43.389
I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff.

459
01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:46.646
Couldn't y'all have taken
a van out there?

460
01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.144
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

461
01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:51.693
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load on me?

462
01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:53.690
You get your ass out of here.

463
01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:03.659
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself

464
01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:06.366
when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

465
01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:09.995
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

466
01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:12.418
I know that.

467
01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.883
I've seen him.

468
01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.962
You've seen him? And you're not dead?

469
01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:23.971
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

470
01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:25.927
I don't think that's how I'd describe him.

471
01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.138
How would you describe him?

472
01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:32.476
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humour.

473
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.186
His name's Chigurh.

474
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.739
-Sugar?
-Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

475
01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:40.943
-You know how he found you?
-Yeah, I know how he found me.

476
01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:44.246
-It's called a transponder.
-I know what it's called.

477
01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.992
He won't find me again.

478
01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:48.199
-Not that way.
-Not any way.

479
01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:50.160
Took me about three hours.

480
01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:51.665
Yeah, well, I been immobile.

481
01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:54.498
No. You don't understand.

482
01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.297
What do you do?

483
01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:00.336
I'm retired.

484
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:02.923
-What did you do?
-Welder.

485
01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:04.553
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

486
01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:06.884
Any of it.
If it can be welded, I can weld it.

487
01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.845
-Cast iron?
-Yeah.

488
01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:11.271
-I don't mean braze.
- I didn't say braze.

489
01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:13.474
-Pot metal?
-What did I say?

490
01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:16.819
Were you in Nam?

491
01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.023
Yeah, I was in Nam.

492
01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:22.950
So was |I.

493
01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:26.036
So what does that make me,
your buddy?

494
01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.325
Look, you gotta give me this money.

495
01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:33.002
I got no other reason to protect you.

496
01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:36.210
It's too late. I spent it.

497
01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:39.884
About a million-and-a-half
on whores and whiskey,

498
01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:42.712
and the rest of it, I just sort of blew it in.

499
01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:47.475
How do you know
he's not on his way to Odessa?

500
01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:53.314
Why would he go to Odessa?

501
01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:55.646
Kill your wife.

502
01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:07.078
Maybe he's the one
who needs to be worried about me.

503
01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.746
He isn't.

504
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.411
Yeah.

505
01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.412
You're not cut out for this.

506
01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:16.337
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

507
01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:25.012
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

508
01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:26.806
Carson Wells.

509
01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:29.558
Call me when you've had enough.

510
01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.637
I can even let you
keep a little of the money.

511
01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:36.269
If I was into cutting deals, why
wouldn't I just deal with this guy Sugar?

512
01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.695
Oh, no, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

513
01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:42.317
Even if you gave him the money back,

514
01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:45.992
he'd still Kill you
just for inconveniencing him.

515
01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:47.819
He's a peculiar man.

516
01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:49.745
Might even say he has principles.

517
01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:54.497
Principles that transcend money
or drugs or anything like that.

518
01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:56.915
Not like you.

519
01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:00.373
Yeah. He's not even like me.

520
01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:04.131
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

521
01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.764
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

522
01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:13.470
Don't know why I did.
I told you, I don't know where he is.

523
01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.896
-You haven't heard from him?
-No, I ain't.

524
01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:17.815
-Nothing?
-Not word one.

525
01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.518
Would you tell me if you had?

526
01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:21.899
Well, I don't know.

527
01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:27.026
-He don't need any trouble from you.
-It ain't me he's in trouble with.

528
01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:30.282
-Who's he in trouble with, then?
-Some pretty bad people.

529
01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:34.491
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

530
01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:37.498
He won't, neither. He never has.

531
01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:40.166
He can take all comers.

532
01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:46.886
You know Charlie Walser's got
that place out east of Sanderson?

533
01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.216
Well, you know how he used
to slaughter beeves,

534
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:54.974
hit 'em right there with a maul,
truss 'em up and slit their throats?

535
01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.852
You know, Charlie's got one
all trussed up, all set to drain him,

536
01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:01.185
and the beef comes to,
starts thrashing around.

537
01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:03.815
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

538
01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:06.443
You'll excuse the... Well.

539
01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:09.116
Charlie grabs a gun there,
shoot the damn thing in the head,

540
01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:12.036
but with all the swinging
and the thrashing, it's a glance shot.

541
01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:14.989
Ricochets around, comes back,
hits Charlie in the shoulder.

542
01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:19.078
You go see Charlie, he still can't pick up
his right hand for his hat.

543
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.960
The point being that even in the contest
between man and steer,

544
01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:24.791
the issue is not certain.

545
01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:36.929
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I'd make him safe.

546
01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:45.733
Course, they slaughter steers
a lot different these days.

547
01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:47.484
Use a air gun.

548
01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:49.941
Shoots out a little rod
about that far into the brain.

549
01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:53.198
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

550
01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:59.743
-Why are you telling me that, Sheriff?
- I don't know.

551
01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:05.089
My mind wanders.

552
01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.299
Hello, Carson.

553
01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:34.421
Let's go to your room.

554
01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:49.356
You don't have to do this.

555
01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:51.938
I'm a day trader.

556
01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:53.898
I could just go home.

557
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:56.617
You could.

558
01:21:56.703 --> 01:22:00.241
Make it worth your while,
take you to an ATM

559
01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.664
with 14 grand in it.

560
01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.163
And everybody just walks away.

561
01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:07.916
An ATM?

562
01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:15.586
I know where the satchel is.

563
01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:18.048
If you knew, you would have it with you.

564
01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:21.885
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

565
01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.684
I know something better.

566
01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.436
-What's that?
-I know where it's going to be.

567
01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:30.984
Where's that?

568
01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:33.153
It will be brought to me,

569
01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:35.898
and placed at my feet.

570
01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.860
You don't know to a certainty.

571
01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.617
In 20 minutes it could be here.

572
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.619
I do know to a certainty.

573
01:22:44.710 --> 01:22:47.668
And you know
what's gonna happen now, Carson?

574
01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.917
You should admit your situation.

575
01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:53.375
There would be more dignity in it.

576
01:22:58.223 --> 01:22:59.554
You go to hell.

577
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:04.639
All right. Let me ask you something.

578
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.732
If the rule you followed

579
01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.604
brought you to this,

580
01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:14.645
of what use was the rule?

581
01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:23.696
Do you have any idea
how crazy you are?

582
01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:27.624
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

583
01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.748
I mean the nature of you.

584
01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:35.132
You...

585
01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:39.671
You can have the money, Anton.

586
01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:21.762
-Hello?
-Yes?

587
01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:26.642
Is Carson Wells there?

588
01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:31.810
Not in the sense that you mean.

589
01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.185
<i>You need to come see me.</i>

590
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.736
Who is this?

591
01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.905
You know who it is.

592
01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:42.820
You need to talk to me.

593
01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:45.949
-I don't need to talk to you.
- I think you do.

594
01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:48.784
Do you know where I'm going?

595
01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:51.458
Why would I care where you're going?

596
01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:53.377
I know where you are.

597
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:55.667
Yeah? Where am [?

598
01:24:56.258 --> 01:25:00.593
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

599
01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:03.379
Do you know where I'm going?

600
01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:07.133
Yeah, I know where you're going.

601
01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:08.513
All right.

602
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:10.932
You know she won't be there.

603
01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:13.606
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

604
01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:15.899
So, what're you going up there for?

605
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:22.273
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

606
01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:25.242
Nope.

607
01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:27.949
I think you do.

608
01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.997
So, this is what I'll offer.

609
01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:33.542
You bring me the money
and I'll let her go.

610
01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:37.838
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

611
01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:42.501
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

612
01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:46.430
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

613
01:25:49.936 --> 01:25:52.678
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

614
01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.514
I've decided to make you
a special project of mine.

615
01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:58.442
You ain't gonna have to come
look for me at all.

616
01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:05.157
-The motel in Del Rio?
-Yes, Sir.

617
01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:07.029
None of the three had ID on them,

618
01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.361
but they're telling me
that all three is Mexicans.

619
01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:10.787
Was Mexicans.

620
01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:15.118
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

621
01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:19.371
Yes, sir.

622
01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:22.216
Now, Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

623
01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:24.213
Yes, sir. It was punched out.

624
01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:25.419
Okay.

625
01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:27.588
You wanna drive out there?

626
01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:28.969
Naw, that's all I had to look for,

627
01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:31.721
and it sound like these old boys
died of natural causes.

628
01:26:31.812 --> 01:26:34.895
-How's that, Sheriff?
-Natural to the line of work they was in.

629
01:26:34.981 --> 01:26:36.142
Yes, sir.

630
01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:40.101
My God, Wendell, it's just all-out war.
I can't think of any other word for it.

631
01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.527
Who are these people?

632
01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:46.152
Here, last week, they found
this couple out in California.

633
01:26:46.243 --> 01:26:49.986
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill them, bury them in the yard,

634
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.321
cash their Social Security cheques.

635
01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:56.542
They'd torture them first.
I don't know why.

636
01:26:57.754 --> 01:27:00.086
Maybe their television set was broke.

637
01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:03.382
And this went on until... Here, I quote.

638
01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:06.927
"Neighbours were alerted
when a man ran from the premises

639
01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:08.924
"wearing only a dog collar."

640
01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:14.640
You can't make up such a thing as that.
I dare you to even try.

641
01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:18.064
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

642
01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:21.108
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

643
01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:30.322
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

644
01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.410
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

645
01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:39.702
Tell me something.

646
01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:43.960
Who do you think gets through this gate
into the United States of America?

647
01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:48.628
-I don't know. American citizens?
-Some American citizens.

648
01:27:48.722 --> 01:27:50.804
-Who do you think decides?
-You do, I reckon.

649
01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:54.009
That is correct. How do I decide?

650
01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:56.013
-I don't know.
-I ask questions.

651
01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.436
And if I get sensible answers,
then they get to go to America.

652
01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:00.059
And if I don't get sensible answers,
they don't.

653
01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.640
Anything about that
you don't understand?

654
01:28:01.735 --> 01:28:03.100
-No, sir.
-Then I ask you again,

655
01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:05.812
how you come to be out here
with no clothes?

656
01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:08.363
Well, I got an overcoat on.

657
01:28:09.326 --> 01:28:10.908
-Are you jacking with me?
-Oh, no, sir.

658
01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:12.985
-Don't jack with me.
-Yes, sir.

659
01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:15.988
-You in the service?
-No, sir, I'm a veteran.

660
01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:18.494
-Nam?
-Yes, sir, two tours.

661
01:28:18.585 --> 01:28:19.700
What outfit?

662
01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:25.165
Twelfth Infantry Battalion,
August 7, 1966, July 2, 1968.

663
01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:29.335
-Wilson.
-Yes, sir?

664
01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:34.090
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

665
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:45.271
How those Larry's holding up?

666
01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:48.525
-Good, good. I need everything else.
-Okay.

667
01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:52.821
You have a lot of people come in here
without any clothes on?

668
01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.993
No, sir. It's unusual.

669
01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:11.631
-She don't want to talk to you.
-Yes, she does. Put her on.

670
01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:14.213
-Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care what time it is,

671
01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:16.674
and don't you hang up this phone.

672
01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:20.227
Discombobulated by
a no-account son-in-law.

673
01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:22.972
-Llewelyn?
-Hey, you.

674
01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:24.807
What should I do?

675
01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:26.141
You know what's going on?

676
01:29:26.236 --> 01:29:29.900
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County.

677
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:33.199
-What'd you tell him?
-What did I know to tell him?

678
01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.193
You're hurt, ain't you?

679
01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:39.576
What makes you say that?

680
01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:41.498
I can hear it in your voice.

681
01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:43.201
There is falseness in his voice!

682
01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:47.038
Well, look, I want you to meet me
at the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

683
01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:49.419
Because I'm gonna give you the money,
I'm gonna put you on a plane.

684
01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.796
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you
in the lurch.

685
01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:53.594
No, look, this works better.

686
01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.012
With you gone and I don't have
the money, he can't touch me,

687
01:29:56.099 --> 01:29:58.090
but I can sure touch him.

688
01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.767
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

689
01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:04.063
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with Mother?

690
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:06.311
-She'll be all right.
-She'll be all right?

691
01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:08.859
Be all right? I got the cancer!

692
01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:11.027
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

693
01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:47.059
Who are you?

694
01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.145
-Me?
-Yes.

695
01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:54.525
Nobody.

696
01:30:55.742 --> 01:30:57.198
Accounting.

697
01:30:58.745 --> 01:31:01.157
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

698
01:31:03.625 --> 01:31:04.956
He feels...

699
01:31:05.752 --> 01:31:07.493
He felt that

700
01:31:08.004 --> 01:31:10.917
-the more people looking...
-That's foolish.

701
01:31:11.007 --> 01:31:13.294
You pick the one right tool.

702
01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:15.800
I see.

703
01:31:18.598 --> 01:31:20.384
Are you going to shoot me?

704
01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:28.271
That depends.

705
01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:32.484
Do you see me?

706
01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.985
I always seen this is what it'd come to.

707
01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.363
Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.

708
01:31:40.453 --> 01:31:42.160
It ain't even three years
we been married.

709
01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:46.912
Three years ago I said them very words.
"No" and "good."

710
01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:50.290
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

711
01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.338
I got the cancer and look at this,

712
01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:55.757
not even my home to go to.

713
01:31:56.678 --> 01:31:59.295
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

714
01:31:59.389 --> 01:32:02.472
You know how many people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

715
01:32:02.559 --> 01:32:03.890
No, ma'am.

716
01:32:03.977 --> 01:32:05.718
That's how many.

717
01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:16.399
I didn't see my prednisone.

718
01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:18.947
-I put it in, Mama.
-Well, I didn't see it.

719
01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:23.198
Well, I put it in that one.
You just set there.

720
01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:25.370
I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.

721
01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:27.698
You need help with the bags, madam?

722
01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:31.535
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

723
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:34.462
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well.

724
01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.085
Which bus are you taking?

725
01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:39.214
Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

726
01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:42.012
It's not often you see a Mexican
in a suit.

727
01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:45.307
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

728
01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:48.097
Carla Jean, how are you?

729
01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:52.102
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

730
01:32:52.192 --> 01:32:53.853
Who's Charlie Walser?

731
01:32:57.363 --> 01:32:59.445
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail,

732
01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:01.944
but it's certainly true it is a story.

733
01:33:02.035 --> 01:33:03.150
Yeah, right.

734
01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:06.953
Sheriff, can you give me your word
on something?

735
01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.280
Yes, ma'am.

736
01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:12.083
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,

737
01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:15.413
you promise it'll be just you
who goes and talks with him?

738
01:33:15.507 --> 01:33:17.248
You and nobody else.

739
01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:19.003
Yes, ma'am, I do.

740
01:33:19.094 --> 01:33:20.801
Llewelyn would never ask for help.

741
01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:23.962
He never thinks he needs any.

742
01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:26.765
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

743
01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:31.179
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

744
01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:42.481
Hey, what's the problem
there, neighbour?

745
01:33:42.575 --> 01:33:46.660
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

746
01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:50.205
You from around here?

747
01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:53.329
Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.
Here you go.

748
01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:56.624
What airport would you use?

749
01:33:56.714 --> 01:33:59.376
Well, airport or airstrip?

750
01:33:59.509 --> 01:34:00.999
Airport.

751
01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:04.841
-Well, where you going?
- I don't know.

752
01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:07.631
Just lighting out for the territories, huh?

753
01:34:07.725 --> 01:34:09.716
Brother, I been there.

754
01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:13.224
Well, there's airstrips.

755
01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.521
The airport is El Paso.

756
01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:17.308
If you want someplace specific,

757
01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:21.566
you might could be better off just driving
to Dallas, not have to connect.

758
01:34:22.198 --> 01:34:24.030
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

759
01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:27.033
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

760
01:34:27.829 --> 01:34:29.240
What are you talking about?

761
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:49.344
Hey, Mr Sporting Goods.

762
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:51.387
Hey, yourself.

763
01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:53.268
You a sport?

764
01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:55.933
Yeah, that's me.

765
01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:58.356
I got beers in my room.

766
01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:01.276
Oh, I'm waiting on my wife.

767
01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:05.443
Oh. That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

768
01:35:05.575 --> 01:35:06.781
Well, half.

769
01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:08.616
What else, then?

770
01:35:09.287 --> 01:35:11.779
Just looking for what's coming.

771
01:35:11.915 --> 01:35:15.124
Yeah. But no one ever sees that.

772
01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:19.461
Beer. That's what's coming.

773
01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:22.130
I'll bring the ice chest out here.
You can stay married.

774
01:35:22.258 --> 01:35:24.920
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

775
01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:28.720
Beer leads to more beer.

776
01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:17.269
You all right?

777
01:36:22.485 --> 01:36:24.192
Call the police.

778
01:36:30.034 --> 01:36:32.196
Your local law enforcement.

779
01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:35.954
I'm not on their radio.

780
01:37:26.257 --> 01:37:29.375
Buy you a cup of coffee
before you drive home?

781
01:37:29.427 --> 01:37:30.713
No money in his room there?

782
01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:33.299
Couple hundred, on his person.

783
01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:35.798
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

784
01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:37.924
I suppose so.

785
01:37:37.977 --> 01:37:40.264
Though they was leaving in a hurry.

786
01:37:40.313 --> 01:37:45.228
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

787
01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:49.444
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

788
01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:53.402
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

789
01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:56.284
You know, if you'd have told me
20 years ago

790
01:37:56.412 --> 01:38:01.282
that I'd see children walking the streets
of our Texas towns with green hair,

791
01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:03.158
bones in their noses,

792
01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:05.456
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

793
01:38:05.505 --> 01:38:06.836
Signs and wonders.

794
01:38:06.964 --> 01:38:11.629
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to follow.

795
01:38:11.677 --> 01:38:13.259
-Oh, it's the tide.
-Yeah.

796
01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:16.797
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

797
01:38:16.933 --> 01:38:18.844
Not the one thing.

798
01:38:18.976 --> 01:38:21.934
Yeah, well, none of that
explains your man, though.

799
01:38:21.979 --> 01:38:25.017
He's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

800
01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:26.981
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.

801
01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:28.608
Yeah, well, what would you call him?

802
01:38:28.653 --> 01:38:32.021
Well, sometimes,
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

803
01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:34.113
-He's real, all right.
-Oh, yeah?

804
01:38:34.158 --> 01:38:36.650
Yeah.
All of that over at the Eagle Hotel?

805
01:38:36.786 --> 01:38:37.947
Just beyond everything.

806
01:38:37.995 --> 01:38:40.487
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

807
01:38:40.623 --> 01:38:43.365
Why, well, that don't hardly say it.

808
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:46.501
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

809
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:50.998
walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired army colonel.

810
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:52.540
It's hard to believe.

811
01:38:52.677 --> 01:38:55.965
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

812
01:38:56.013 --> 01:38:57.845
Now, who'd do such a thing?

813
01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:00.678
How do you defend against it?

814
01:39:01.561 --> 01:39:06.351
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

815
01:42:39.195 --> 01:42:40.936
In back!

816
01:42:41.072 --> 01:42:42.608
How'd you know I was here?

817
01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.402
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

818
01:42:45.451 --> 01:42:46.612
You heard it?

819
01:42:46.744 --> 01:42:49.031
-How's that?
-Did you hear my...

820
01:42:50.122 --> 01:42:51.612
You're having fun with me.

821
01:42:51.749 --> 01:42:55.583
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

822
01:42:55.711 --> 01:42:57.918
How'd you know it was my truck?

823
01:42:58.047 --> 01:43:01.130
I deduced it when you walked in.

824
01:43:01.258 --> 01:43:02.919
How many of them things you got now?

825
01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:05.585
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

826
01:43:05.721 --> 01:43:08.930
Well, it depends on
what you mean by "got."

827
01:43:09.058 --> 01:43:12.801
Some of them are half wild,
some of them are just outlaws.

828
01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.101
How you been, Ellis?

829
01:43:18.943 --> 01:43:20.479
You're looking at it.

830
01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:24.733
I got to say, you're looking older.

831
01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:26.272
I am older.

832
01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:29.950
Got a letter from your wife.

833
01:43:29.995 --> 01:43:34.580
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

834
01:43:35.292 --> 01:43:38.330
-Didn't know there was any.
-Told me you're quitting.

835
01:43:41.298 --> 01:43:44.086
-You want a cup?
-Appreciate it.

836
01:43:51.809 --> 01:43:53.516
How fresh is that coffee?

837
01:43:53.644 --> 01:43:58.639
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

838
01:44:01.318 --> 01:44:03.685
That man that shot you died in prison?

839
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:08.152
Angola. Yeah.

840
01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:10.992
What'd you done,
he'd have been released?

841
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.703
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

842
01:44:14.331 --> 01:44:16.493
Wouldn't be no point in it.

843
01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:19.117
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

844
01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:24.040
Well, all the time you spend trying to
get back what's been took from you,

845
01:44:24.175 --> 01:44:26.166
more is going out the door.

846
01:44:26.677 --> 01:44:30.716
After a while, you just have to try
to get a tourniquet on it.

847
01:44:30.848 --> 01:44:34.967
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

848
01:44:37.688 --> 01:44:40.225
Loretta tells me you're quitting.

849
01:44:40.357 --> 01:44:43.190
-How come you doing that?
- I don't know.

850
01:44:46.989 --> 01:44:48.730
I feel overmatched.

851
01:44:53.162 --> 01:44:55.699
I always figured when I got older,

852
01:44:55.831 --> 01:45:00.200
God would sort of
come into my life somehow.

853
01:45:03.672 --> 01:45:05.208
And he didn't.

854
01:45:08.511 --> 01:45:10.218
I don't blame him.

855
01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:15.924
If I was him, I'd have the same opinion
of me that he does.

856
01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:18.051
You don't know what he thinks.

857
01:45:32.243 --> 01:45:36.077
I sent Uncle Mac's thumb buster
and badge over to the Rangers,

858
01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:38.078
put it in their museum.

859
01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:42.583
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

860
01:45:43.379 --> 01:45:47.247
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

861
01:45:49.218 --> 01:45:53.382
Seven or eight of them come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

862
01:45:54.431 --> 01:45:58.299
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun, well...

863
01:45:58.769 --> 01:46:00.726
They was ahead of him.

864
01:46:01.272 --> 01:46:03.388
Shot him in his doorway.

865
01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:06.391
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

866
01:46:06.443 --> 01:46:10.152
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

867
01:46:10.281 --> 01:46:14.275
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

868
01:46:15.828 --> 01:46:20.117
After a while one of them said
something in Indian and they turned,

869
01:46:20.958 --> 01:46:22.289
left out.

870
01:46:24.962 --> 01:46:28.330
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

871
01:46:28.465 --> 01:46:30.627
Shot through the left lung.

872
01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:35.800
And that was that, as they say.

873
01:46:39.643 --> 01:46:41.008
When'd he die?

874
01:46:42.104 --> 01:46:45.313
1909.

875
01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:49.685
No, I mean, was it right away,
or in the night or...

876
01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.310
When was it?

877
01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:55.322
I believe it was that night.
She buried him the next morning.

878
01:46:55.367 --> 01:46:58.280
Digging in that hard old caliche.

879
01:47:01.332 --> 01:47:03.790
What you got ain't nothing new.

880
01:47:05.169 --> 01:47:07.501
This country is hard on people.

881
01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.541
You can't stop what's coming.

882
01:47:15.471 --> 01:47:17.382
It ain't all waiting on you.

883
01:47:20.392 --> 01:47:22.133
That's vanity.

884
01:48:23.247 --> 01:48:25.579
I knew this wasn't done with.

885
01:48:28.293 --> 01:48:30.250
I ain't got the money.

886
01:48:32.381 --> 01:48:36.750
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

887
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.802
I buried my mother today.

888
01:48:40.931 --> 01:48:43.047
Ain't paid for that, neither.

889
01:48:43.934 --> 01:48:45.925
I wouldn't worry about it.

890
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:50.141
I need to sit down.

891
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:07.947
You got no cause to hurt me.

892
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.288
No. But I gave my word.

893
01:49:12.796 --> 01:49:14.958
You gave your word?

894
01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:16.751
To your husband.

895
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:21.336
That don't make sense.

896
01:49:22.306 --> 01:49:25.594
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

897
01:49:25.642 --> 01:49:29.010
Your husband had the opportunity
to save you.

898
01:49:29.146 --> 01:49:32.104
Instead he used you
to try to save himself.

899
01:49:37.154 --> 01:49:38.815
Not like that.

900
01:49:40.783 --> 01:49:42.649
Not like you say.

901
01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:50.326
You don't have to do this.

902
01:49:50.375 --> 01:49:52.616
People always say the same thing.

903
01:49:54.338 --> 01:49:55.794
What do they say?

904
01:49:56.632 --> 01:49:59.374
They say, "You don't have to do this."

905
01:50:00.135 --> 01:50:01.500
You don't.

906
01:50:04.014 --> 01:50:05.175
Okay.

907
01:50:10.312 --> 01:50:12.394
This is the best I can do.

908
01:50:13.398 --> 01:50:14.684
Call it.

909
01:50:19.029 --> 01:50:22.522
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

910
01:50:24.993 --> 01:50:27.655
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

911
01:50:28.539 --> 01:50:30.530
-Call it.
-No.

912
01:50:32.668 --> 01:50:34.534
I ain't gonna call it.

913
01:50:37.923 --> 01:50:39.254
Call it.

914
01:50:39.383 --> 01:50:41.545
The coin don't have no say.

915
01:50:42.678 --> 01:50:44.214
It's just you.

916
01:50:47.057 --> 01:50:50.015
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

917
01:52:32.829 --> 01:52:36.038
Mister, you got a bone
sticking out of your arm.

918
01:52:36.166 --> 01:52:38.282
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

919
01:52:38.335 --> 01:52:41.794
There's an ambulance coming.
The man over yonder went to call.

920
01:52:41.838 --> 01:52:43.203
All right.

921
01:52:43.799 --> 01:52:45.790
Are you all right?

922
01:52:45.842 --> 01:52:48.709
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

923
01:52:48.845 --> 01:52:51.007
What'll you take for the shirt?

924
01:52:55.352 --> 01:52:58.344
Well, hell, mister, I'll give you my shirt.

925
01:53:05.529 --> 01:53:07.816
Look at that fucking bone.

926
01:53:08.865 --> 01:53:10.230
Tie this for me.

927
01:53:11.159 --> 01:53:13.196
Just tie it, just tie it.

928
01:53:31.388 --> 01:53:35.006
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

929
01:53:35.058 --> 01:53:37.516
-That's a lot of money.
-Take it.

930
01:53:37.561 --> 01:53:41.099
Take it and you didn't see me.

931
01:53:41.231 --> 01:53:43.188
I was already gone.

932
01:53:43.233 --> 01:53:44.439
Yes, sir.

933
01:53:49.072 --> 01:53:50.733
You know part of that's mine, right?

934
01:53:50.866 --> 01:53:52.402
You still got your damn shirt.

935
01:53:52.534 --> 01:53:54.024
Ain't even what it was for.

936
01:53:54.077 --> 01:53:56.739
Well, maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

937
01:54:17.267 --> 01:54:19.634
-Maybe ['ll go riding.
-Okay.

938
01:54:19.770 --> 01:54:21.101
What do you think?

939
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:23.470
Well, I can't plan your day.

940
01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:28.939
-I mean, would you care to join me?
-Lord, no, I'm not retired.

941
01:54:30.572 --> 01:54:32.654
Maybe I'll help out here, then.

942
01:54:33.742 --> 01:54:35.153
Better not.

943
01:54:39.331 --> 01:54:42.824
-How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

944
01:54:42.959 --> 01:54:46.577
Well, you got time for them now.
Anything interesting?

945
01:54:47.255 --> 01:54:49.997
They always is to the party concerned.

946
01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:54.672
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

947
01:54:57.349 --> 01:55:00.341
All right, then. Two of them,
both had my father in them.

948
01:55:00.477 --> 01:55:02.468
It's peculiar.

949
01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:05.479
I'm older now than he ever was
by 20 years.

950
01:55:05.607 --> 01:55:09.646
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

951
01:55:09.778 --> 01:55:12.645
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,

952
01:55:13.657 --> 01:55:15.648
but it was about meeting him
in town somewheres

953
01:55:15.784 --> 01:55:17.821
and he give me some money.

954
01:55:17.953 --> 01:55:19.694
I think I lost it.

955
01:55:21.498 --> 01:55:26.664
The second one, it was like
we was both back in older times.

956
01:55:26.711 --> 01:55:30.500
And I was a-horseback
going through the mountains of a night.

957
01:55:30.549 --> 01:55:33.166
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

958
01:55:34.136 --> 01:55:37.345
It was cold
and there was snow on the ground.

959
01:55:37.389 --> 01:55:39.801
And he would...
Rode past me and kept on going.

960
01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:42.968
Never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

961
01:55:43.019 --> 01:55:48.059
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

962
01:55:50.193 --> 01:55:53.857
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn,

963
01:55:53.905 --> 01:55:55.361
the way people used to do,

964
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:58.699
and I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

965
01:55:58.743 --> 01:56:00.825
about the colour of the moon.

966
01:56:02.164 --> 01:56:06.533
And in the dream,
I knew that he was going on ahead.

967
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:09.205
And he was fixing to make a fire

968
01:56:09.337 --> 01:56:12.546
somewhere out there
in all that dark and all that cold.

969
01:56:16.094 --> 01:56:19.428
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

970
01:56:23.727 --> 01:56:25.217
Then I woke up.
