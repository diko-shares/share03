1
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.300

2
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.300


3
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.622
[I amar prestar aen.]
The world is changed.

4
00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:37.622



5
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.792
[Han mathon ne nen.]
I feel it in the water.

6
00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.792



7
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.462
[Han mathon ne chae.]
I feel it in the earth.

8
00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:44.462



9
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.050
[A han noston ned 'wilith.]
I smell it in the air.

10
00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:49.050



11
00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.344
Much that once was...

12
00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:53.137
is lost.

13
00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:56.849
For none now live who remember it.

14
00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:14.158
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

15
00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.327
Three were given to the Elves:

16
00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:20.290
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

17
00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:23.418
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

18
00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:28.590
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

19
00:01:29.048 --> 00:01:30.300
And nine...

20
00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:33.511
nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

21
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.557
who, above all else, desire power.

22
00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:43.896
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

23
00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:48.568
But they were all of them deceived.

24
00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:50.903
For another ring was made.

25
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.325
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

26
00:01:55.742 --> 00:02:00.204
the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

27
00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:02.457
to control all others.

28
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:06.628
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

29
00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:11.049
and his will to dominate all life.

30
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.887
One Ring to rule them all.

31
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:18.389
One by one...

32
00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:23.269
the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

33
00:02:23.478 --> 00:02:26.522
But there were some who resisted.

34
00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:31.653
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

35
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:36.491
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

36
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.570
[Tangado haid!]
Hold positions!

37
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.630


38
00:02:51.668 --> 00:02:55.268
[Leithio I philinn!]
Fire the arrows!

39
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.100


40
00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:09.440
Victory was near.

41
00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:15.947
But the power of the Ring...

42
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:18.199
could not be undone.

43
00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:44.726
It was in this moment...

44
00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:47.311
when all hope had faded...

45
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.649
that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

46
00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:29.228
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

47
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.279
The Ring passed to Isildur...

48
00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:42.700
who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

49
00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.536
But the hearts of Men...

50
00:04:45.745 --> 00:04:48.247
are easily corrupted.

51
00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:53.127
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.

52
00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.947
It betrayed Isildur...

53
00:05:22.782 --> 00:05:25.201
to his death.

54
00:05:29.372 --> 00:05:33.251
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

55
00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:35.795
were lost.

56
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.840
History became legend...

57
00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:41.050
legend became myth.

58
00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.136
And for
two and a half thousand years...

59
00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:48.015
the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

60
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.477
Until, when chance came...

61
00:05:52.144 --> 00:05:55.273
it ensnared a new bearer.

62
00:05:56.607 --> 00:06:01.445
My precious.

63
00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:04.240
The Ring came
to the creature Gollum...

64
00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:08.327
who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

65
00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.497
And there it consumed him.

66
00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:13.791
It came to me.

67
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.421
My own. My love. My own.

68
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:23.342
My precious.

69
00:06:26.971 --> 00:06:30.391
The Ring brought
to Gollum unnatural long life.

70
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.437
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

71
00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:39.233
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

72
00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:42.695
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

73
00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:45.781
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

74
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.784
whispers of a nameless fear.

75
00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:52.288
And the Ring of Power perceived...

76
00:06:52.496 --> 00:06:55.291
its time had now come.

77
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.379
It abandoned Gollum.

78
00:07:01.047 --> 00:07:05.551
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

79
00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:10.973
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

80
00:07:11.182 --> 00:07:12.224
What's this?

81
00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:13.893
A Hobbit.

82
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.812
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

83
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:18.773
A ring.

84
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:20.858
Lost!

85
00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:27.073
My precious is lost!

86
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.575
For the time will soon come...

87
00:07:29.825 --> 00:07:34.997
when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

88
00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:42.838
The 22nd day of September...

89
00:07:43.005 --> 00:07:44.215
in the year 1400...

90
00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:48.052
by Shire-reckoning.

91
00:07:49.428 --> 00:07:54.141
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

92
00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:56.894
the Shire...

93
00:07:57.061 --> 00:07:59.897
Middle-earth.

94
00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:07.863
The Third Age of this world.

95
00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:23.421
There and Back Again:

96
00:08:23.963 --> 00:08:25.798
A Hobbit's Tale.

97
00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:28.467
By Bilbo Baggins.

98
00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:36.475
Now...

99
00:08:37.184 --> 00:08:39.186
where to begin?

100
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.522
Ah, yes...

101
00:08:45.985 --> 00:08:47.695
"Concerning...

102
00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:50.531
Hobbits."

103
00:08:51.657 --> 00:08:55.202
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

104
00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:57.371
for many hundreds of years...

105
00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:00.499
quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

106
00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:03.878
by the world of the Big Folk.

107
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:09.884
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

108
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.220
Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

109
00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:17.433
being neither renowned
as great warriors...

110
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.812
nor counted among the very wise.

111
00:09:26.192 --> 00:09:29.195
Frodo! Someone at the door.

112
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.948
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

113
00:09:33.199 --> 00:09:37.661
that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

114
00:09:37.995 --> 00:09:40.206
A rather unfair observation...

115
00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:44.085
as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

116
00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:47.213
and the smoking of pipe-weed.

117
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:50.508
But where our hearts truly lie...

118
00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:52.843
is in peace and quiet...

119
00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:55.679
and good, tilled earth.

120
00:09:55.846 --> 00:10:01.060
For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

121
00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:08.609
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

122
00:10:08.818 --> 00:10:14.031
But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:

123
00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:20.496
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

124
00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:27.878
Frodo, the door!

125
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:32.995
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

126
00:10:33.884 --> 00:10:35.553
Frodo!

127
00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:44.895
Down from the door where it began

128
00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:53.404
And I must follow if I can

129
00:10:54.405 --> 00:10:58.492
The road goes ever on and on

130
00:10:58.742 --> 00:11:02.246
Down from the door where it began

131
00:11:02.413 --> 00:11:07.376
Now far ahead the road has gone

132
00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:11.797
- And I must follow if I can
- You're late.

133
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:18.888
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

134
00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:24.310
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

135
00:11:35.654 --> 00:11:38.782
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

136
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.332
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

137
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.169
How is the old rascal?

138
00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:54.215
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

139
00:11:54.423 --> 00:11:56.842
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

140
00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:59.011
Well, that should please him.

141
00:11:59.178 --> 00:12:01.013
Half the Shire's been invited.

142
00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:03.933
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

143
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:10.397
And so life in the Shire goes on...

144
00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:13.651
very much as it has
this past Age...

145
00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:19.365
full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

146
00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:21.450
If it comes at all.

147
00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:26.163
For things are made to endure
in the Shire...

148
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.833
passing from one generation
to the next.

149
00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:35.214
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

150
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:36.715
in Bag End.

151
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.346
And there always will be.

152
00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:46.392
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

153
00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:50.020
I mean, more than usual.

154
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.982
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

155
00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:58.696
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

156
00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:13.043
Where's it gone?

157
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.905
He's up to something.

158
00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:52.541
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

159
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.470
But I know you have something
to do with it.

160
00:13:54.626 --> 00:13:55.753
Good gracious me.

161
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:58.401
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

162
00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:00.090
Indeed.

163
00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:02.593
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

164
00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:09.099
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

165
00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:12.853
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

166
00:14:13.062 --> 00:14:17.107
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

167
00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:19.443
Oh, really?

168
00:14:25.074 --> 00:14:27.034
Gandalf! Gandalf!

169
00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.375
Fireworks, Gandalf!

170
00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:40.047
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

171
00:14:58.899 --> 00:14:59.942
Gandalf?

172
00:15:00.484 --> 00:15:04.613
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

173
00:15:09.076 --> 00:15:10.828
So am I.

174
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:31.473
Whoa, whoa.

175
00:15:42.693 --> 00:15:44.194
No, thank you!

176
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:48.323
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

177
00:15:48.532 --> 00:15:52.035
And what about very old friends?

178
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.874
Gandalf?

179
00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:01.044
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

180
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:06.383
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

181
00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:10.137
You haven't aged a day.

182
00:16:16.727 --> 00:16:18.729
Come on, come in!

183
00:16:18.896 --> 00:16:21.356
Welcome, welcome.

184
00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:25.068
Oh, here we are.

185
00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:29.198
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

186
00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:33.160
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

187
00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:37.414
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

188
00:16:38.582 --> 00:16:43.086
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

189
00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:45.923
Just tea, thank you.

190
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.095
Oh!

191
00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:53.931
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

192
00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:57.434
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

193
00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:02.940
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

194
00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:06.443
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

195
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:10.614
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

196
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:15.244
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

197
00:17:15.452 --> 00:17:18.288
I've just found some sponge cake.

198
00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.688
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

199
00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:28.966
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

200
00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.469
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

201
00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:35.430
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

202
00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:37.224
I'm not at home!

203
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.816
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

204
00:17:45.983 --> 00:17:48.110
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

205
00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:51.280
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

206
00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:54.425
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

207
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.326
never giving me a moment's peace.

208
00:17:57.119 --> 00:18:00.664
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

209
00:18:00.831 --> 00:18:05.335
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

210
00:18:05.502 --> 00:18:09.506
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

211
00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:11.967
All the arrangements are made.

212
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:15.512
Oh, thank you.

213
00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:18.348
Frodo suspects something.

214
00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:21.018
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

215
00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:23.854
not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

216
00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:27.190
You will tell him, won't you?

217
00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:30.152
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

218
00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:33.864
I know.

219
00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:39.536
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

220
00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:43.665
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

221
00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:47.544
The woods, the fields.

222
00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:50.047
Little rivers.

223
00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:57.220
I am old, Gandalf.

224
00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:03.894
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

225
00:19:06.063 --> 00:19:08.565
I feel thin.

226
00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.400
Sort of stretched...

227
00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:15.072
like butter scraped
over too much bread.

228
00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:19.743
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

229
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.205
And I don't expect I shall return.

230
00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:28.585
In fact, I mean not to.

231
00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:35.384
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

232
00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:51.733
Ah.

233
00:19:52.734 --> 00:19:55.278
Gandalf, my old friend...

234
00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:58.281
this will be a night to remember.

235
00:20:21.138 --> 00:20:22.139
Hello, hello.

236
00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:26.476
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

237
00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:30.105
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

238
00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:36.278
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

239
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.114
Go on!

240
00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:51.001
So there I was...

241
00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:55.338
at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

242
00:20:55.505 --> 00:20:57.507
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

243
00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:00.135
about how they were
going to cook us.

244
00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:05.348
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

245
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:09.936
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

246
00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.690
that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

247
00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.194
and turned them all to stone!

248
00:21:22.491 --> 00:21:23.867
Quickly.

249
00:21:26.328 --> 00:21:27.829
Whoa!

250
00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:30.040
Up they go!

251
00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.211
No, the big one.

252
00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:46.223
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

253
00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:48.350
Are all these children yours?

254
00:21:48.517 --> 00:21:51.520
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

255
00:21:53.522 --> 00:21:54.856
Bilbo?

256
00:21:56.566 --> 00:21:58.235
Sackville-Bagginses!

257
00:21:58.485 --> 00:21:59.569
Quickly, hide!

258
00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:11.581
Thank you, my boy.

259
00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.502
You're a good lad, Frodo.

260
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:19.589
I'm very selfish, you know.

261
00:22:20.006 --> 00:22:23.426
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

262
00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:25.988
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

263
00:22:26.012 --> 00:22:27.556
but it wasn't out of charity.

264
00:22:28.265 --> 00:22:29.724
I think it was because...

265
00:22:29.891 --> 00:22:32.227
of all my numerous relations...

266
00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:36.022
you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

267
00:22:36.273 --> 00:22:38.113
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

268
00:22:38.275 --> 00:22:40.026
No.

269
00:22:40.277 --> 00:22:42.946
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

270
00:22:43.113 --> 00:22:46.408
The point is, Frodo...

271
00:22:49.452 --> 00:22:51.454
you'll be all right.

272
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:56.960
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

273
00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:58.628
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

274
00:22:58.795 --> 00:23:00.297
This was your idea.

275
00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:17.647
Bilbo.

276
00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:21.651
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

277
00:23:21.818 --> 00:23:25.155
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

278
00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:42.339
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

279
00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:48.094
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

280
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:50.138
I might've known.

281
00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:58.104
Speech, Bilbo!

282
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.315
Speech!

283
00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:01.608
Speech!

284
00:24:06.863 --> 00:24:09.157
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

285
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.160
Tooks and Brandybucks...

286
00:24:12.327 --> 00:24:14.829
Grubbs, Chubbs...

287
00:24:15.038 --> 00:24:16.081
Hornblowers...

288
00:24:17.207 --> 00:24:18.875
Bolgers...

289
00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:20.835
Bracegirdles...

290
00:24:21.044 --> 00:24:23.672
- and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

291
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.010
Today is my 111th birthday!

292
00:24:30.804 --> 00:24:32.347
Happy birthday!

293
00:24:32.555 --> 00:24:36.851
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

294
00:24:37.018 --> 00:24:39.896
such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

295
00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:43.566
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

296
00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:48.363
and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

297
00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:53.493
I, uh...

298
00:24:58.331 --> 00:25:00.709
I have things to do.

299
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.217
I've put this off far too long.

300
00:25:13.054 --> 00:25:17.017
I regret to announce this is the end!

301
00:25:18.184 --> 00:25:19.352
I'm going now.

302
00:25:20.437 --> 00:25:23.356
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

303
00:25:25.734 --> 00:25:26.943
Goodbye.

304
00:26:00.185 --> 00:26:03.313
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

305
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.900
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

306
00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:12.113
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

307
00:26:12.322 --> 00:26:14.491
It was just a bit of fun.

308
00:26:14.699 --> 00:26:18.411
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

309
00:26:19.788 --> 00:26:23.333
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

310
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.211
As often as I can spare them.

311
00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:29.589
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

312
00:26:29.798 --> 00:26:33.134
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

313
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.639
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

314
00:26:38.723 --> 00:26:41.684
No. Wait, it's...

315
00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:46.856
here in my pocket.

316
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:54.739
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

317
00:26:56.366 --> 00:26:59.869
Yet, after all, why not?

318
00:27:01.454 --> 00:27:06.334
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

319
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:08.962
Is that so hard?

320
00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:10.463
Well, no.

321
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:14.384
And yes.

322
00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:19.389
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

323
00:27:19.639 --> 00:27:21.391
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

324
00:27:21.558 --> 00:27:25.812
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

325
00:27:26.271 --> 00:27:28.064
It's mine.

326
00:27:29.315 --> 00:27:31.818
My own.

327
00:27:32.152 --> 00:27:36.156
- My precious.
- Precious?

328
00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:39.200
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

329
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:41.995
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

330
00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:44.914
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

331
00:27:45.165 --> 00:27:48.001
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

332
00:27:48.209 --> 00:27:52.422
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

333
00:27:52.672 --> 00:27:56.342
I am not trying to rob you.

334
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:03.099
I'm trying to help you.

335
00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:14.903
All your long years,
we've been friends.

336
00:28:15.278 --> 00:28:17.447
Trust me as you once did.

337
00:28:19.282 --> 00:28:21.117
Let it go.

338
00:28:22.243 --> 00:28:24.662
You're right, Gandalf.

339
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:29.459
The ring must go to Frodo.

340
00:28:30.793 --> 00:28:33.796
It's late. The road is long.

341
00:28:33.963 --> 00:28:36.466
Yes, it is time.

342
00:28:39.302 --> 00:28:41.304
- Bilbo.
- Hm?

343
00:28:41.804 --> 00:28:44.307
The ring is still in your pocket.

344
00:28:46.684 --> 00:28:48.603
Ah. Yes.

345
00:29:19.008 --> 00:29:22.011
I've thought up an ending for my book:

346
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.685
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

347
00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:32.313
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

348
00:29:33.356 --> 00:29:34.816
Goodbye, Gandalf.

349
00:29:37.318 --> 00:29:40.196
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

350
00:29:47.996 --> 00:29:52.208
The road goes ever on and on

351
00:29:54.752 --> 00:29:57.130
Until our next meeting.

352
00:30:24.532 --> 00:30:28.202
It's mine. My own.

353
00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:31.789
My precious.

354
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:35.001
Riddles in the dark.

355
00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:36.627
Bilbo!

356
00:30:36.794 --> 00:30:38.379
Bilbo!

357
00:30:42.008 --> 00:30:44.927
My precious.

358
00:30:46.554 --> 00:30:48.765
Precious.

359
00:30:48.931 --> 00:30:51.517
He's gone, hasn't he?

360
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:57.315
He talked for so long about leaving...

361
00:30:57.565 --> 00:31:00.276
I didn't think he'd really do it.

362
00:31:04.739 --> 00:31:06.616
Gandalf?

363
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.584
Bilbo's ring.

364
00:31:16.918 --> 00:31:19.295
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

365
00:31:19.462 --> 00:31:22.590
He's left you Bag End.

366
00:31:26.177 --> 00:31:28.763
Along with all his possessions.

367
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:31.808
The ring is yours now.

368
00:31:34.435 --> 00:31:37.939
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

369
00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:40.387
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

370
00:31:40.566 --> 00:31:44.821
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

371
00:31:45.696 --> 00:31:48.324
I don't understand.

372
00:31:51.661 --> 00:31:52.662
Neither do I.

373
00:31:55.957 --> 00:31:58.292
Keep it secret.

374
00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:00.211
Keep it safe.

375
00:32:35.204 --> 00:32:37.373
Shire!

376
00:32:37.707 --> 00:32:40.835
Baggins!

377
00:33:29.383 --> 00:33:32.261
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

378
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:36.891
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

379
00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:40.770
and the finding
of the Ring of Power."

380
00:33:44.273 --> 00:33:46.108
"It has come to me.

381
00:33:46.275 --> 00:33:49.779
The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

382
00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:53.407
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

383
00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:57.411
for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.

384
00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.122
It is precious to me...

385
00:34:00.957 --> 00:34:03.626
though I buy it with great pain.

386
00:34:06.754 --> 00:34:10.967
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

387
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.972
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

388
00:34:16.222 --> 00:34:20.268
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

389
00:34:36.784 --> 00:34:39.787
Shire.

390
00:34:39.954 --> 00:34:41.956
Baggins.

391
00:34:42.456 --> 00:34:46.502
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

392
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.672
That way.

393
00:34:55.678 --> 00:34:57.888
To heal my heart and drown my woe

394
00:34:58.055 --> 00:35:00.391
Rain may fall and wind may blow

395
00:35:00.558 --> 00:35:02.518
But there still be

396
00:35:02.685 --> 00:35:04.145
Many miles to go

397
00:35:04.353 --> 00:35:06.272
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

398
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.649
And the stream that falls
From hill to plain

399
00:35:08.858 --> 00:35:10.693
Better than rain or rippling brook

400
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.279
Is a mug of beer inside this Took

401
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:19.535
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

402
00:35:19.994 --> 00:35:23.831
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

403
00:35:24.332 --> 00:35:25.708
War is brewing.

404
00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:29.211
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

405
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.048
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

406
00:35:32.214 --> 00:35:36.719
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

407
00:35:36.886 --> 00:35:39.889
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

408
00:35:40.056 --> 00:35:41.515
And proud of it.

409
00:35:41.682 --> 00:35:43.934
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

410
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:48.230
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

411
00:35:48.397 --> 00:35:52.735
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

412
00:35:56.072 --> 00:35:58.282
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

413
00:35:58.449 --> 00:36:02.953
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

414
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.539
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

415
00:36:05.706 --> 00:36:10.252
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

416
00:36:11.253 --> 00:36:12.421
Does she?

417
00:36:13.089 --> 00:36:16.092
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

418
00:36:40.866 --> 00:36:43.369
Is it secret? Is it safe?

419
00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:50.584
Ah.

420
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:54.380
What are you doing?

421
00:37:06.976 --> 00:37:09.478
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

422
00:37:09.645 --> 00:37:10.813
It's quite cool.

423
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.152
What can you see?

424
00:37:17.987 --> 00:37:20.322
Can you see anything?

425
00:37:23.033 --> 00:37:24.493
Nothing.

426
00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:27.121
There's nothing.

427
00:37:28.164 --> 00:37:29.665
Wait.

428
00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:36.005
There are markings.

429
00:37:37.506 --> 00:37:40.926
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

430
00:37:41.135 --> 00:37:43.679
There are few who can.

431
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:49.059
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

432
00:37:49.685 --> 00:37:50.728
Mordor!

433
00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.022
In the common tongue, it says:

434
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.734
"One Ring to rule them all...

435
00:37:57.026 --> 00:37:59.320
One Ring to find them...

436
00:37:59.528 --> 00:38:01.697
One Ring to bring them all...

437
00:38:02.031 --> 00:38:05.034
and in the darkness bind them."

438
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.704
This is the One Ring...

439
00:38:08.871 --> 00:38:14.168
forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

440
00:38:14.376 --> 00:38:18.380
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

441
00:38:19.173 --> 00:38:21.717
Bilbo found it.

442
00:38:22.176 --> 00:38:24.094
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

443
00:38:24.345 --> 00:38:28.891
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

444
00:38:29.058 --> 00:38:32.478
prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

445
00:38:33.103 --> 00:38:37.566
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

446
00:38:37.733 --> 00:38:40.110
The Ring has awoken.

447
00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:43.072
It's heard its master's call.

448
00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.201
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

449
00:38:52.915 --> 00:38:55.000
No, Frodo.

450
00:38:55.918 --> 00:38:59.255
The spirit of Sauron endured.

451
00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:04.760
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

452
00:39:05.094 --> 00:39:07.263
Sauron has returned.

453
00:39:08.138 --> 00:39:10.266
His Orcs have multiplied.

454
00:39:10.432 --> 00:39:14.478
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

455
00:39:14.645 --> 00:39:19.441
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

456
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.735
He is seeking it.

457
00:39:21.944 --> 00:39:25.781
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

458
00:39:26.031 --> 00:39:28.742
For the Ring yearns above all else...

459
00:39:28.951 --> 00:39:32.329
to return to the hand
of its master.

460
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:34.331
They are one...

461
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.626
the Ring and the Dark Lord.

462
00:39:37.793 --> 00:39:38.836
Frodo...

463
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.297
he must never find it.

464
00:39:41.463 --> 00:39:42.548
All right.

465
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.177
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

466
00:39:47.344 --> 00:39:50.055
No one knows it's here, do they?

467
00:39:55.686 --> 00:39:56.937
Do they, Gandalf?

468
00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.358
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

469
00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:05.654
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

470
00:40:05.821 --> 00:40:07.990
But the enemy found him first.

471
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.202
I don't know how long
they tortured him.

472
00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:16.874
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

473
00:40:17.082 --> 00:40:19.209
Shire!

474
00:40:19.376 --> 00:40:21.003
Baggins!

475
00:40:21.211 --> 00:40:23.047
Shire.

476
00:40:23.213 --> 00:40:26.175
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

477
00:40:28.844 --> 00:40:30.012
Who goes there?

478
00:40:31.722 --> 00:40:32.973
Take it, Gandalf!

479
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:34.391
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

480
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.977
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

481
00:40:37.186 --> 00:40:40.522
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

482
00:40:42.024 --> 00:40:44.234
I dare not take it.

483
00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:47.029
Not even to keep it safe.

484
00:40:48.197 --> 00:40:50.199
Understand, Frodo...

485
00:40:50.866 --> 00:40:54.495
I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

486
00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:05.631
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

487
00:41:06.215 --> 00:41:09.134
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

488
00:41:11.011 --> 00:41:12.638
No, it can't.

489
00:41:17.935 --> 00:41:19.353
What must I do?

490
00:41:21.021 --> 00:41:24.566
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

491
00:41:24.733 --> 00:41:28.028
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

492
00:41:28.278 --> 00:41:29.405
Bree.

493
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:32.366
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

494
00:41:32.574 --> 00:41:35.035
at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

495
00:41:35.244 --> 00:41:38.956
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

496
00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:41.166
I don't have any answers.

497
00:41:42.668 --> 00:41:48.257
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

498
00:41:48.424 --> 00:41:50.551
He'll know what to do.

499
00:41:51.176 --> 00:41:53.971
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

500
00:41:54.263 --> 00:41:56.765
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

501
00:41:57.391 --> 00:42:00.686
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

502
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:04.481
I can cut across country
easily enough.

503
00:42:06.984 --> 00:42:08.318
My dear Frodo.

504
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.655
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

505
00:42:11.822 --> 00:42:14.783
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

506
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.327
And yet, after a hundred years...

507
00:42:17.494 --> 00:42:19.580
they can still surprise you.

508
00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:22.499
Get down.

509
00:42:34.803 --> 00:42:38.265
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

510
00:42:38.432 --> 00:42:42.936
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

511
00:42:43.103 --> 00:42:45.522
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

512
00:42:45.731 --> 00:42:48.609
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

513
00:42:48.817 --> 00:42:49.860
Nothing important.

514
00:42:50.444 --> 00:42:54.531
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

515
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.495
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

516
00:43:00.162 --> 00:43:01.830
No?

517
00:43:02.998 --> 00:43:04.166
Perhaps not.

518
00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:08.837
I've thought of a better use for you.

519
00:43:10.547 --> 00:43:13.550
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

520
00:43:15.052 --> 00:43:17.346
Be careful, both of you.

521
00:43:17.554 --> 00:43:20.349
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

522
00:43:20.557 --> 00:43:23.519
Birds, beasts.

523
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.064
Is it safe?

524
00:43:28.774 --> 00:43:30.150
Never put it on...

525
00:43:30.359 --> 00:43:33.737
for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

526
00:43:33.904 --> 00:43:35.405
Always remember, Frodo...

527
00:43:35.906 --> 00:43:39.076
the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

528
00:43:39.493 --> 00:43:41.578
It wants to be found.

529
00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:24.413
This is it.

530
00:44:24.746 --> 00:44:26.915
This is what?

531
00:44:27.207 --> 00:44:29.251
If I take one more step...

532
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:33.630
it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

533
00:44:37.926 --> 00:44:39.428
Come on, Sam.

534
00:44:47.853 --> 00:44:49.646
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

535
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:53.984
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

536
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:58.614
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

537
00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:02.951
there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

538
00:45:16.965 --> 00:45:18.800
Sam.

539
00:45:22.304 --> 00:45:23.430
Wood-elves.

540
00:45:37.152 --> 00:45:40.656
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

541
00:45:41.198 --> 00:45:42.991
To the Grey Havens.

542
00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:45.619
They're leaving Middle-earth.

543
00:45:45.786 --> 00:45:47.996
Never to return.

544
00:45:50.874 --> 00:45:53.001
I don't know why...

545
00:45:53.669 --> 00:45:56.088
it makes me sad.

546
00:45:58.173 --> 00:46:02.803
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

547
00:46:03.512 --> 00:46:05.222
Just shut your eyes...

548
00:46:05.389 --> 00:46:08.183
and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

549
00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:12.312
with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

550
00:46:21.613 --> 00:46:24.324
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

551
00:46:24.491 --> 00:46:27.369
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

552
00:46:29.705 --> 00:46:32.040
Me neither, Sam.

553
00:47:00.569 --> 00:47:03.613
Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.

554
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.449
The hour grows late.

555
00:47:05.657 --> 00:47:09.244
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...

556
00:47:09.411 --> 00:47:11.872
seeking my counsel.

557
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:16.084
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

558
00:47:16.251 --> 00:47:17.544
My old friend.

559
00:47:17.794 --> 00:47:19.421
Saruman.

560
00:47:24.217 --> 00:47:27.262
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

561
00:47:28.055 --> 00:47:30.307
So the Ring of Power has been found.

562
00:47:30.474 --> 00:47:33.727
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

563
00:47:33.894 --> 00:47:37.064
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

564
00:47:37.689 --> 00:47:42.194
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

565
00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:47.074
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

566
00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.700
Time?

567
00:47:49.618 --> 00:47:52.245
What time do you think we have?

568
00:47:52.704 --> 00:47:56.583
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

569
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.960
He cannot yet take physical form...

570
00:47:59.211 --> 00:48:01.922
but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

571
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:07.636
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

572
00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:14.142
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

573
00:48:15.644 --> 00:48:18.814
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

574
00:48:19.731 --> 00:48:24.986
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

575
00:48:25.946 --> 00:48:27.739
The Eye of Sauron.

576
00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:30.534
He is gathering all evil to him.

577
00:48:30.742 --> 00:48:33.245
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

578
00:48:33.412 --> 00:48:35.622
for an assault upon Middle-earth.

579
00:48:35.956 --> 00:48:38.333
You know this?

580
00:48:38.834 --> 00:48:40.335
How?

581
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:42.629
I have seen it.

582
00:48:43.046 --> 00:48:46.258
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

583
00:48:46.967 --> 00:48:48.468
Why?

584
00:48:48.927 --> 00:48:51.638
Why should we fear to use it?

585
00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:58.186
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

586
00:48:58.353 --> 00:49:01.606
We do not know who else
may be watching.

587
00:49:04.192 --> 00:49:06.945
The hour is later than you think.

588
00:49:07.112 --> 00:49:09.448
Sauron's forces are already moving.

589
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.453
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

590
00:49:14.828 --> 00:49:15.871
The Nine?

591
00:49:16.037 --> 00:49:19.124
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

592
00:49:19.291 --> 00:49:21.960
disguised as riders in black.

593
00:49:22.169 --> 00:49:26.131
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

594
00:49:27.716 --> 00:49:29.968
And kill the one who carries it.

595
00:49:30.469 --> 00:49:31.970
Frodo!

596
00:49:44.566 --> 00:49:48.987
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

597
00:49:49.738 --> 00:49:52.532
There are none who can.

598
00:49:55.035 --> 00:49:57.746
Against the power of Mordor...

599
00:49:57.913 --> 00:50:00.582
there can be no victory.

600
00:50:02.542 --> 00:50:05.712
We must join with him, Gandalf.

601
00:50:07.005 --> 00:50:09.341
We must join with Sauron.

602
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.679
It would be wise, my friend.

603
00:50:15.138 --> 00:50:16.598
Tell me...

604
00:50:16.765 --> 00:50:17.849
friend...

605
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:23.396
when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

606
00:51:02.894 --> 00:51:04.604
I gave you the chance...

607
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:08.400
of aiding me willingly...

608
00:51:08.567 --> 00:51:12.737
but you have elected
the way of pain!

609
00:51:36.011 --> 00:51:37.512
Mr. Frodo?

610
00:51:38.138 --> 00:51:39.931
Frodo? Frodo!

611
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:44.603
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

612
00:51:44.769 --> 00:51:47.772
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

613
00:51:48.607 --> 00:51:52.485
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

614
00:51:52.736 --> 00:51:56.364
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

615
00:51:59.326 --> 00:52:00.368
Frodo.

616
00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:02.871
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

617
00:52:03.038 --> 00:52:04.456
Get off him.

618
00:52:04.956 --> 00:52:06.458
Come on, Frodo.

619
00:52:06.625 --> 00:52:08.501
What's the meaning of this?

620
00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.712
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

621
00:52:13.214 --> 00:52:15.342
You get back here!

622
00:52:16.343 --> 00:52:17.677
Get out of my field!

623
00:52:17.844 --> 00:52:20.680
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

624
00:52:20.889 --> 00:52:23.850
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

625
00:52:24.017 --> 00:52:25.143
And some cabbages.

626
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:28.229
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

627
00:52:28.396 --> 00:52:32.484
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

628
00:52:32.692 --> 00:52:34.861
he's clearly overreacting.

629
00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:36.571
Run!

630
00:52:50.043 --> 00:52:52.587
Oh, that was close.

631
00:52:53.672 --> 00:52:56.800
I think I've broken something.

632
00:52:57.801 --> 00:53:00.178
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

633
00:53:00.345 --> 00:53:04.015
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

634
00:53:04.182 --> 00:53:06.434
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

635
00:53:15.193 --> 00:53:16.695
That's mine.

636
00:53:19.447 --> 00:53:21.074
That's nice, Merry.

637
00:53:21.616 --> 00:53:23.618
Here's a nice one, Sam.

638
00:53:23.827 --> 00:53:26.371
I think we should get off the road.

639
00:53:35.547 --> 00:53:36.923
Get off the road!

640
00:53:37.132 --> 00:53:38.633
Quick!

641
00:53:51.312 --> 00:53:52.814
Be quiet!

642
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:01.299
What was that?

643
00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:35.500
Anything?

644
00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:37.669
Nothing.

645
00:55:38.378 --> 00:55:40.672
What is going on?

646
00:55:41.214 --> 00:55:45.009
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

647
00:55:46.344 --> 00:55:47.846
Frodo?

648
00:55:48.555 --> 00:55:49.597
Get down!

649
00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:08.783
I have to leave the Shire.

650
00:56:09.784 --> 00:56:12.078
Sam and I must get to Bree.

651
00:56:12.287 --> 00:56:13.705
Right.

652
00:56:15.081 --> 00:56:17.375
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

653
00:56:25.633 --> 00:56:27.010
Run!

654
00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:30.221
This way! Follow me!

655
00:56:33.766 --> 00:56:34.809
Run!

656
00:56:48.072 --> 00:56:49.824
Get the rope, Sam!

657
00:56:52.493 --> 00:56:54.037
Frodo!

658
00:56:54.746 --> 00:56:56.164
Run, Frodo!

659
00:56:56.497 --> 00:56:57.582
- Go!
- Hurry!

660
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.418
Frodo, come on!

661
00:57:01.336 --> 00:57:03.338
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

662
00:57:18.311 --> 00:57:22.523
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

663
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:38.623
Come on.

664
00:57:49.801 --> 00:57:53.221
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

665
00:57:56.724 --> 00:57:59.560
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

666
00:57:59.727 --> 00:58:03.690
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

667
00:58:04.107 --> 00:58:07.235
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

668
00:58:08.236 --> 00:58:10.822
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

669
00:58:10.989 --> 00:58:13.533
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

670
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.536
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

671
00:58:16.703 --> 00:58:18.871
Can't be too careful.

672
00:58:38.599 --> 00:58:42.103
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

673
00:59:06.252 --> 00:59:07.879
Excuse me.

674
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.716
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

675
00:59:11.883 --> 00:59:17.972
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

676
00:59:18.181 --> 00:59:22.810
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

677
00:59:23.978 --> 00:59:26.022
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

678
00:59:27.315 --> 00:59:29.817
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

679
00:59:29.984 --> 00:59:33.154
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

680
00:59:33.571 --> 00:59:35.323
Gandalf.

681
00:59:36.157 --> 00:59:37.825
Oh, yes...

682
00:59:38.034 --> 00:59:40.161
I remember. Elderly chap.

683
00:59:40.495 --> 00:59:43.414
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

684
00:59:43.831 --> 00:59:45.666
Not seen him for six months.

685
00:59:52.423 --> 00:59:53.716
What do we do now?

686
01:00:00.932 --> 01:00:02.183
Sam...

687
01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:04.227
he'll be here. He'll come.

688
01:00:07.021 --> 01:00:09.065
Get out of my way!

689
01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:13.111
What's that?

690
01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:15.863
This, my friend, is a pint.

691
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.698
It comes in pints?

692
01:00:18.032 --> 01:00:21.744
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

693
01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:31.921
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

694
01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:36.968
Excuse me.

695
01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:41.764
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

696
01:00:42.932 --> 01:00:47.353
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

697
01:00:47.603 --> 01:00:52.108
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

698
01:00:54.485 --> 01:00:55.736
Strider.

699
01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:11.961
Baggins.

700
01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:16.966
Baggins.

701
01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:27.476
Baggins. Baggins.

702
01:01:29.312 --> 01:01:31.606
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

703
01:01:32.398 --> 01:01:35.276
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

704
01:01:35.443 --> 01:01:38.487
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

705
01:01:38.654 --> 01:01:40.948
and my third cousin, twice removed...

706
01:01:45.453 --> 01:01:47.205
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

707
01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:19.195
You cannot hide.

708
01:02:22.156 --> 01:02:25.326
I see you.

709
01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:29.705
There is no life...

710
01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:32.083
in the void.

711
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.751
Only...

712
01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:36.170
death.

713
01:02:42.176 --> 01:02:47.056
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

714
01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:52.770
What do you want?

715
01:02:52.979 --> 01:02:55.374
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

716
01:02:55.398 --> 01:02:58.401
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

717
01:02:58.693 --> 01:03:01.237
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

718
01:03:01.404 --> 01:03:05.116
but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

719
01:03:05.616 --> 01:03:08.244
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

720
01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:10.538
Yes.

721
01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:14.625
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

722
01:03:18.629 --> 01:03:21.173
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

723
01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:26.971
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

724
01:03:27.138 --> 01:03:30.057
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

725
01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:31.225
They're coming.

726
01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:56.435
What are they?

727
01:04:58.604 --> 01:05:00.731
They were once Men.

728
01:05:01.232 --> 01:05:03.442
Great kings of Men.

729
01:05:03.651 --> 01:05:06.821
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

730
01:05:07.405 --> 01:05:10.491
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

731
01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:14.078
One by one, falling into darkness.

732
01:05:14.245 --> 01:05:16.747
Now they are slaves to his will.

733
01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:20.835
They are the Nazgûl.

734
01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:23.754
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

735
01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:25.965
At all times they feel...

736
01:05:26.132 --> 01:05:28.092
the presence of the Ring...

737
01:05:28.259 --> 01:05:32.805
drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

738
01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:45.693
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

739
01:05:53.868 --> 01:05:57.997
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

740
01:05:58.164 --> 01:06:01.000
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

741
01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:05.296
- and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

742
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.716
We have no choice but to trust him.

743
01:06:08.883 --> 01:06:12.344
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

744
01:06:14.722 --> 01:06:18.017
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

745
01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:21.353
We're going to see the Elves.

746
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.254
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

747
01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:50.090
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

748
01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:52.510
What about second breakfast?

749
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:59.099
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

750
01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:04.522
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

751
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:08.901
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

752
01:07:14.365 --> 01:07:15.950
Pippin!

753
01:07:32.466 --> 01:07:35.970
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

754
01:07:51.407 --> 01:07:54.707
[Tinúviel elvanui]
Tinuviel the elven-fair,

755
01:07:56.609 --> 01:08:02.909
[Elleth alfirin ethelhael]
Immortal maiden elven-wise,

756
01:08:04.307 --> 01:08:10.207
[O hon ring finnil fuinui]
About him cast her shadow hair,

757
01:08:10.707 --> 01:08:14.707
[A renc gelebrin thiliol.]
And arms like silver glimmering...

758
01:08:14.633 --> 01:08:16.844
Who is she?

759
01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:20.139
This woman you sing of.

760
01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:25.978
'Tis the lady of Lúthien.

761
01:08:26.145 --> 01:08:31.317
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

762
01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:35.279
What happened to her?

763
01:08:37.489 --> 01:08:39.992
She died.

764
01:08:44.038 --> 01:08:46.373
Get some sleep, Frodo.

765
01:08:56.634 --> 01:09:00.721
The power of Isengard
is at your command...

766
01:09:00.888 --> 01:09:05.351
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

767
01:09:08.687 --> 01:09:14.485
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

768
01:09:20.199 --> 01:09:24.662
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

769
01:09:25.079 --> 01:09:27.039
We have work to do.

770
01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:14.253
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

771
01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:16.463
Rip them all down.

772
01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:46.785
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sûl.

773
01:10:48.495 --> 01:10:51.165
We shall rest here tonight.

774
01:11:02.885 --> 01:11:06.305
These are for you.
Keep them close.

775
01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:09.016
I'm going to have a look around.

776
01:11:11.393 --> 01:11:13.312
Stay here.

777
01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:18.025
My tomato's burst.

778
01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:20.152
Could I have some bacon?

779
01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.321
Want a tomato, Sam?

780
01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:26.366
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

781
01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:29.286
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

782
01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:33.499
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

783
01:11:41.924 --> 01:11:43.675
Go!

784
01:12:37.104 --> 01:12:38.564
Back, you devils!

785
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
[Gûm-ishi]
Here, in the void

786
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
[Ashi]
There is only

787
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
[Gurum]
Death

788
01:14:02.064 --> 01:14:03.315
Frodo!

789
01:14:07.361 --> 01:14:09.196
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.

790
01:14:46.233 --> 01:14:47.234
Strider!

791
01:14:50.028 --> 01:14:55.534
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

792
01:14:57.035 --> 01:15:01.915
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

793
01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:07.546
Hurry!

794
01:15:07.754 --> 01:15:11.717
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

795
01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:13.760
Hold on, Frodo.

796
01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:16.388
Gandalf!

797
01:17:54.296 --> 01:17:57.382
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

798
01:17:59.551 --> 01:18:02.387
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

799
01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:07.100
Is he going to die?

800
01:18:07.309 --> 01:18:12.189
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

801
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.198
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

802
01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:22.866
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

803
01:18:23.033 --> 01:18:24.153
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

804
01:18:24.326 --> 01:18:27.454
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

805
01:18:41.843 --> 01:18:45.972
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

806
01:19:10.872 --> 01:19:11.915
Frodo.

807
01:19:13.764 --> 01:19:18.164
[Im Arwen - Telin le thaed.]
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

808
01:19:13.764 --> 01:19:18.164


809
01:19:19.261 --> 01:19:23.561
[Lasto beth nîn, tolo dan na ngalad.]
Hear my voice... Come back to the light.

810
01:19:19.261 --> 01:19:21.361


811
01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:23.561

812
01:19:28.848 --> 01:19:30.684
Who is she?

813
01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:33.103
Frodo.

814
01:19:33.353 --> 01:19:36.856
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

815
01:19:39.109 --> 01:19:41.278
He's not going to last.

816
01:19:41.486 --> 01:19:44.155
We must get him to my father.

817
01:19:44.906 --> 01:19:47.784
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

818
01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:54.040
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

819
01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:57.961
[Dartho guin Berian. Rych le ad tolthathon.]
Stay with the Hobbits - I will send horses for you.

820
01:19:55.161 --> 01:19:57.961


821
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.100


822
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.100
[Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im.]
I'm the faster rider. I'll take him.

823
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.700
[Andelu I ven.]
The road is too dangerous.

824
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.700


825
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:03.133
What are they saying?

826
01:20:03.134 --> 01:20:05.675
[Frodo fîr. Ae athradon I hîr...]
If I can get across the river...

827
01:20:03.134 --> 01:20:05.675



828
01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:08.975
[tûr gwaith nîn beriatha hon.]
The power of my people will help him.

829
01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:08.975



830
01:20:09.222 --> 01:20:10.890
I do not fear them.

831
01:20:14.659 --> 01:20:16.159
[Be iest lîn.]
As you wish

832
01:20:14.659 --> 01:20:16.159


833
01:20:20.734 --> 01:20:22.152
Arwen...

834
01:20:22.319 --> 01:20:25.530
ride hard. Don't look back.

835
01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.383
[Noro lim, Asfaloth. Noro lim!]
Run fast, Asfaloth. Run fast!

836
01:20:30.577 --> 01:20:34.956
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

837
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:47.390
[Noro lim, Asfaloth!]
Ride fast Asfaloth!

838
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:47.390


839
01:22:29.571 --> 01:22:32.282
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

840
01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:35.785
If you want him, come and claim him.

841
01:22:47.748 --> 01:22:49.148
[Nîn o Chithaeglir...]
Waters of the Misty Mountains,

842
01:22:47.748 --> 01:22:49.148



843
01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:50.550
[...lasto beth daer;]
listen to the great word.

844
01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:50.550


845
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:53.660
[Rimmo nˆn Bruinen dan in Ulaer.]
Flow waters of loudwater
against the ringwraiths

846
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:53.660



847
01:22:53.643 --> 01:22:55.043
[Nîn o Chithaeglir...]
Waters of the Misty Mountains,

848
01:22:53.643 --> 01:22:55.043


849
01:22:55.043 --> 01:22:56.443
[...lasto beth daer;]
listen to the great word.

850
01:22:55.043 --> 01:22:56.443



851
01:22:56.650 --> 01:23:00.550
[Rimmo nˆn Bruinen dan in Ulaer!]
Flow waters of loudwater
against the ringwraiths.

852
01:22:56.650 --> 01:23:00.550



853
01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:32.175
No. No!

854
01:23:35.428 --> 01:23:37.722
Frodo, no.

855
01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:40.225
Frodo, don't give in.

856
01:23:40.433 --> 01:23:42.435
Not now.

857
01:23:53.363 --> 01:23:55.865
What grace is given me...

858
01:23:56.533 --> 01:23:58.368
let it pass to him.

859
01:23:58.618 --> 01:24:00.745
Let him be spared.

860
01:24:01.371 --> 01:24:03.414
Save him.

861
01:24:05.643 --> 01:24:09.643
[Lasto beth nîn... tolo dan na ngalad.]
Hear my voice... Come back to the light.

862
01:24:05.643 --> 01:24:09.643



863
01:24:15.802 --> 01:24:20.974
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

864
01:24:21.432 --> 01:24:27.939
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

865
01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:33.695
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

866
01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:38.408
And you're lucky to be here too.

867
01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:43.079
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

868
01:24:43.288 --> 01:24:47.417
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

869
01:24:55.008 --> 01:24:57.510
What happened, Gandalf?

870
01:24:58.469 --> 01:25:03.850
- Why didn't you meet us?
- Oh, I am sorry, Frodo.

871
01:25:08.605 --> 01:25:10.356
I was delayed.

872
01:25:11.232 --> 01:25:15.445
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

873
01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:24.203
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

874
01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:27.248
Embrace the power of the Ring...

875
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:30.335
or embrace your own destruction!

876
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:36.507
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

877
01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:40.762
Only one who can bend it to his will.

878
01:25:41.554 --> 01:25:45.516
And he does not share power.

879
01:25:59.864 --> 01:26:03.242
So you have chosen death.

880
01:26:13.294 --> 01:26:17.090
Gandalf? What is it?

881
01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:19.842
Nothing, Frodo.

882
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:22.345
Frodo!

883
01:26:22.553 --> 01:26:23.596
Frodo!

884
01:26:23.805 --> 01:26:26.182
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

885
01:26:26.391 --> 01:26:29.102
Sam has hardly left your side.

886
01:26:29.352 --> 01:26:31.552
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

887
01:26:31.896 --> 01:26:37.026
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

888
01:26:38.528 --> 01:26:42.115
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

889
01:27:30.163 --> 01:27:33.499
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

890
01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:35.376
Bilbo.

891
01:27:40.381 --> 01:27:42.133
"There and Back Again:

892
01:27:42.383 --> 01:27:45.136
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

893
01:27:48.181 --> 01:27:51.768
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

894
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:55.897
wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

895
01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:58.649
visit Lake-town...

896
01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:02.278
see the Lonely Mountain again.

897
01:28:02.695 --> 01:28:07.617
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

898
01:28:19.712 --> 01:28:21.506
I miss the Shire.

899
01:28:21.923 --> 01:28:27.053
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

900
01:28:27.386 --> 01:28:30.973
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

901
01:28:33.935 --> 01:28:37.522
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

902
01:28:42.735 --> 01:28:45.947
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

903
01:28:47.073 --> 01:28:49.408
My dear boy.

904
01:28:53.496 --> 01:28:57.458
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

905
01:28:58.251 --> 01:29:00.044
No harm in being prepared.

906
01:29:00.253 --> 01:29:02.839
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

907
01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:05.925
- More than anything.
- I did.

908
01:29:06.092 --> 01:29:08.010
It's just...

909
01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:11.430
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

910
01:29:11.597 --> 01:29:15.268
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

911
01:29:15.476 --> 01:29:18.771
seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

912
01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.690
Off home.

913
01:29:24.861 --> 01:29:26.863
You are right, Sam.

914
01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:31.784
We did what we set out to do.

915
01:29:32.368 --> 01:29:34.954
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

916
01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:41.377
I am ready to go home.

917
01:29:42.128 --> 01:29:44.213
His strength returns.

918
01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:50.094
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

919
01:29:50.636 --> 01:29:53.222
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

920
01:29:53.389 --> 01:29:57.101
the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

921
01:29:57.310 --> 01:30:00.646
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

922
01:30:00.897 --> 01:30:06.319
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

923
01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:11.157
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

924
01:30:11.407 --> 01:30:14.160
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

925
01:30:14.327 --> 01:30:17.580
Our list of allies grows thin.

926
01:30:18.331 --> 01:30:21.125
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

927
01:30:21.334 --> 01:30:25.004
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

928
01:30:25.171 --> 01:30:27.632
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

929
01:30:27.924 --> 01:30:32.511
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

930
01:30:32.678 --> 01:30:35.097
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

931
01:30:35.556 --> 01:30:39.602
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

932
01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:44.190
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

933
01:30:48.027 --> 01:30:49.111
Gandalf...

934
01:30:50.446 --> 01:30:53.032
the Ring cannot stay here.

935
01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:15.721
This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

936
01:31:15.972 --> 01:31:18.683
They must decide now how to end it.

937
01:31:19.725 --> 01:31:23.312
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

938
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.566
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

939
01:31:27.733 --> 01:31:32.863
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

940
01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:37.326
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

941
01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.370
Men?

942
01:31:40.246 --> 01:31:43.499
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

943
01:31:43.666 --> 01:31:48.129
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

944
01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:51.924
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

945
01:31:52.133 --> 01:31:53.759
I was there, Gandalf.

946
01:31:54.427 --> 01:31:57.263
I was there 3000 years ago...

947
01:32:04.103 --> 01:32:06.522
when Isildur took the Ring.

948
01:32:06.689 --> 01:32:10.609
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

949
01:32:13.154 --> 01:32:15.698
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

950
01:32:17.283 --> 01:32:20.911
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

951
01:32:21.162 --> 01:32:24.707
where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

952
01:32:24.874 --> 01:32:27.460
Cast it into the fire!

953
01:32:32.631 --> 01:32:36.427
- Destroy it!
- No.

954
01:32:37.762 --> 01:32:39.930
Isildur!

955
01:32:40.389 --> 01:32:45.144
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

956
01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:53.486
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

957
01:32:54.403 --> 01:32:58.074
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

958
01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:03.079
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

959
01:33:03.287 --> 01:33:06.665
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

960
01:33:08.334 --> 01:33:12.171
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

961
01:33:12.338 --> 01:33:14.465
He has chosen exile.

962
01:33:45.704 --> 01:33:47.706
You are no Elf.

963
01:33:47.873 --> 01:33:49.959
Men of the South are welcome here.

964
01:33:50.543 --> 01:33:54.046
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

965
01:33:55.548 --> 01:33:58.384
Then we are here on common purpose...

966
01:33:58.759 --> 01:34:00.219
friend.

967
01:34:15.401 --> 01:34:18.320
The shards of Narsil.

968
01:34:21.782 --> 01:34:26.245
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

969
01:34:29.165 --> 01:34:31.417
It's still sharp.

970
01:34:40.301 --> 01:34:43.387
But no more than a broken heirloom.

971
01:35:10.206 --> 01:35:13.250
Why do you fear the past?

972
01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:19.465
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

973
01:35:19.715 --> 01:35:23.135
You are not bound to his fate.

974
01:35:23.636 --> 01:35:27.640
The same blood flows in my veins.

975
01:35:30.643 --> 01:35:33.229
The same weakness.

976
01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:38.734
Your time will come.

977
01:35:38.943 --> 01:35:43.322
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

978
01:35:46.201 --> 01:35:49.201
[A si i-Dhuath ú-orthor, Aragorn.]
The Shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn.

979
01:35:46.201 --> 01:35:49.201


980
01:35:49.785 --> 01:35:53.585
[Ú or le a ú or nin.]
Not over you and not over me.

981
01:35:49.785 --> 01:35:53.585


982
01:36:04.657 --> 01:36:07.898
[Renich I lú I erui govannem?]
Do you remember the time when we first met?

983
01:36:04.657 --> 01:36:07.898


984
01:36:11.384 --> 01:36:15.584
[Nauthannen I ned ôl reniannen.]
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

985
01:36:11.384 --> 01:36:15.584



986
01:36:16.689 --> 01:36:19.189
[Gwenwin in enninath...]
Long years have passed...

987
01:36:16.689 --> 01:36:19.189



988
01:36:20.037 --> 01:36:23.837
[Ú-'arnech in naeth I si celich.]
You did not have the cares you carry now.

989
01:36:20.037 --> 01:36:23.837



990
01:36:25.739 --> 01:36:27.739
[Renech I beth I pennen?]
Do you remember the word I told you?

991
01:36:25.739 --> 01:36:27.739



992
01:36:33.872 --> 01:36:36.542
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

993
01:36:38.544 --> 01:36:43.549
forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

994
01:36:44.675 --> 01:36:46.552
And to that I hold.

995
01:36:46.719 --> 01:36:50.347
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

996
01:36:50.597 --> 01:36:54.476
than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

997
01:37:03.235 --> 01:37:06.697
I choose a mortal life.

998
01:37:08.032 --> 01:37:12.286
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

999
01:37:15.539 --> 01:37:18.042
like my heart.

1000
01:37:33.807 --> 01:37:37.519
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

1001
01:37:37.728 --> 01:37:41.648
you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

1002
01:37:42.274 --> 01:37:47.154
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

1003
01:37:47.404 --> 01:37:50.908
You will unite, or you will fall.

1004
01:37:51.116 --> 01:37:55.412
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

1005
01:37:57.247 --> 01:38:00.751
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

1006
01:38:14.807 --> 01:38:16.558
So it is true.

1007
01:38:33.992 --> 01:38:36.120
In a dream...

1008
01:38:37.704 --> 01:38:40.833
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

1009
01:38:41.125 --> 01:38:42.835
but in the West
a pale light lingered.

1010
01:38:43.627 --> 01:38:45.379
A voice was crying:

1011
01:38:45.671 --> 01:38:48.590
"Your doom is near at hand.

1012
01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:52.344
Isildur's Bane is found."

1013
01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.200
[Sherkuk-ishi]

1014
01:38:56.348 --> 01:38:58.183
Isildur's Bane.

1015
01:38:58.776 --> 01:39:02.589
[Ash nazg durbatulûk...]
"One ring to rule them all...

1016
01:38:58.851 --> 01:39:00.144


1017
01:38:59.006 --> 01:39:03.072



1018
01:39:02.887 --> 01:39:06.387
[Ash nazg gimbatul...]
One ring to find them...

1019
01:39:03.074 --> 01:39:06.788



1020
01:39:06.787 --> 01:39:09.987
[Ash nazg thrakatulûk...]
One ring to bring them all...

1021
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:11.169


1022
01:39:12.784 --> 01:39:17.284
[agh burzum-ishi krimpatul."]
and in the darkness bind them."

1023
01:39:12.784 --> 01:39:17.284



1024
01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:27.171
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

1025
01:39:27.337 --> 01:39:31.049
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

1026
01:39:31.216 --> 01:39:33.343
for the Black Speech of Mordor...

1027
01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:35.012
may yet be heard...

1028
01:39:35.179 --> 01:39:38.182
in every corner of the West!

1029
01:39:38.348 --> 01:39:41.018
The Ring is altogether evil.

1030
01:39:41.351 --> 01:39:42.853
It is a gift.

1031
01:39:43.437 --> 01:39:45.522
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1032
01:39:46.148 --> 01:39:48.233
Why not use this Ring?

1033
01:39:48.442 --> 01:39:51.195
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

1034
01:39:51.403 --> 01:39:55.741
kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

1035
01:39:56.033 --> 01:39:58.243
are your lands kept safe.

1036
01:40:00.037 --> 01:40:04.374
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1037
01:40:04.666 --> 01:40:08.420
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

1038
01:40:09.046 --> 01:40:13.091
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1039
01:40:13.258 --> 01:40:16.803
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

1040
01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:19.097
This is no mere Ranger.

1041
01:40:20.098 --> 01:40:23.769
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1042
01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:27.189
You owe him your allegiance.

1043
01:40:31.276 --> 01:40:33.195
Aragorn.

1044
01:40:34.947 --> 01:40:37.783
This is Isildur's heir?

1045
01:40:40.118 --> 01:40:42.829
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1046
01:40:44.436 --> 01:40:46.636
[Havo dad, Legolas.]
Sit down, Legolas.

1047
01:40:44.436 --> 01:40:46.636



1048
01:40:49.795 --> 01:40:52.631
Gondor has no king.

1049
01:40:54.466 --> 01:40:56.134
Gondor needs no king.

1050
01:41:02.808 --> 01:41:06.478
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1051
01:41:07.479 --> 01:41:10.983
You have only one choice.

1052
01:41:11.233 --> 01:41:13.610
The Ring must be destroyed.

1053
01:41:18.824 --> 01:41:21.368
What are we waiting for?

1054
01:41:33.505 --> 01:41:36.508
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

1055
01:41:36.758 --> 01:41:41.013
by any craft that we here possess.

1056
01:41:41.513 --> 01:41:45.684
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

1057
01:41:45.851 --> 01:41:49.688
Only there can it be unmade.

1058
01:41:50.731 --> 01:41:53.358
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1059
01:41:53.525 --> 01:41:58.530
and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

1060
01:41:57.550 --> 01:42:00.369
[...ishi makha gulshu darulu.]
...in dark land where shadows lie.

1061
01:42:00.532 --> 01:42:02.534
One of you...

1062
01:42:03.035 --> 01:42:05.203
must do this.

1063
01:42:08.123 --> 01:42:11.835
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1064
01:42:12.711 --> 01:42:16.381
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

1065
01:42:17.215 --> 01:42:21.345
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

1066
01:42:21.553 --> 01:42:25.766
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

1067
01:42:26.558 --> 01:42:28.560
It is a barren wasteland...

1068
01:42:28.769 --> 01:42:32.397
riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

1069
01:42:32.564 --> 01:42:36.401
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

1070
01:42:36.652 --> 01:42:40.906
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

1071
01:42:41.156 --> 01:42:45.577
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1072
01:42:45.786 --> 01:42:48.413
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1073
01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:53.251
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1074
01:42:53.418 --> 01:42:58.757
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

1075
01:43:00.759 --> 01:43:03.261
Never trust an Elf!

1076
01:43:04.429 --> 01:43:10.268
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

1077
01:43:10.602 --> 01:43:13.438
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1078
01:43:14.092 --> 01:43:16.907
[Ash nazg durbatuluk...]
One ring to rule the all...

1079
01:43:14.092 --> 01:43:16.907

1080
01:43:16.876 --> 01:43:19.404
[Ash nazg gimbatul...]
One ring to find them...

1081
01:43:16.876 --> 01:43:19.404

1082
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:21.505
[Ash nazg durbatuluk...]
One ring to rule the all...

1083
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:21.505

1084
01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:23.593
[Ash nazg gimbatul...]
One ring to find them...

1085
01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:23.593

1086
01:43:23.595 --> 01:43:25.588
[Ash nazg durbatuluk...]
One ring to rule the all...

1087
01:43:23.595 --> 01:43:25.588


1088
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:27.794
[Ash nazg gimbatul...]
One ring to find them...

1089
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:27.794

1090
01:43:27.796 --> 01:43:29.796
[Ash nazg durbatuluk...]
One ring to rule them all...

1091
01:43:27.796 --> 01:43:29.796

1092
01:43:32.249 --> 01:43:34.459
I will take it.

1093
01:43:36.461 --> 01:43:38.964
I will take it.

1094
01:43:44.803 --> 01:43:47.848
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1095
01:43:55.897 --> 01:43:57.149
Though...

1096
01:44:00.235 --> 01:44:02.070
I do not know the way.

1097
01:44:04.072 --> 01:44:08.410
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1098
01:44:08.577 --> 01:44:11.955
as long as it is yours to bear.

1099
01:44:13.081 --> 01:44:16.168
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1100
01:44:16.918 --> 01:44:18.253
I will.

1101
01:44:21.465 --> 01:44:23.759
You have my sword.

1102
01:44:25.594 --> 01:44:27.679
And you have my bow.

1103
01:44:28.263 --> 01:44:30.766
And my ax.

1104
01:44:37.773 --> 01:44:40.776
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1105
01:44:42.778 --> 01:44:46.448
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1106
01:44:46.907 --> 01:44:49.326
- then Gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

1107
01:44:51.953 --> 01:44:56.708
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

1108
01:44:56.917 --> 01:45:01.797
even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1109
01:45:02.297 --> 01:45:04.257
We're coming too!

1110
01:45:06.384 --> 01:45:09.137
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1111
01:45:09.387 --> 01:45:12.724
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1112
01:45:13.058 --> 01:45:14.392
mission.

1113
01:45:14.559 --> 01:45:16.061
Quest.

1114
01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:17.562
Thing.

1115
01:45:19.397 --> 01:45:22.067
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1116
01:45:23.652 --> 01:45:25.570
Nine companions.

1117
01:45:27.405 --> 01:45:29.241
So be it.

1118
01:45:29.574 --> 01:45:32.577
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1119
01:45:33.245 --> 01:45:35.080
Great!

1120
01:45:35.288 --> 01:45:37.582
Where are we going?

1121
01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.600
[Anirne hene beriad I chen lîn.]
She wanted to protect her child.

1122
01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.600



1123
01:46:16.899 --> 01:46:20.299
[Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.]
She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

1124
01:46:16.899 --> 01:46:20.299


1125
01:46:23.553 --> 01:46:27.056
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1126
01:46:27.557 --> 01:46:29.225
That you'd never escape your fate.

1127
01:46:29.725 --> 01:46:33.396
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1128
01:46:33.813 --> 01:46:37.733
but only you have the power
to wield it.

1129
01:46:38.734 --> 01:46:41.237
I do not want that power.

1130
01:46:41.404 --> 01:46:44.073
I have never wanted it.

1131
01:46:45.408 --> 01:46:48.035
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1132
01:46:52.415 --> 01:46:54.750
My old sword! Sting.

1133
01:46:54.959 --> 01:46:56.085
Here, take it. Take it.

1134
01:47:01.591 --> 01:47:05.553
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1135
01:47:06.262 --> 01:47:10.349
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1136
01:47:10.558 --> 01:47:15.104
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1137
01:47:15.313 --> 01:47:17.773
Here's a pretty thing.

1138
01:47:18.190 --> 01:47:19.483
Mithril.

1139
01:47:20.276 --> 01:47:24.655
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1140
01:47:24.864 --> 01:47:28.117
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1141
01:47:31.662 --> 01:47:33.122
Oh!

1142
01:47:36.167 --> 01:47:38.210
My old ring.

1143
01:47:39.462 --> 01:47:43.382
I should very much like...

1144
01:47:43.633 --> 01:47:47.637
to hold it again, one last time.

1145
01:48:04.987 --> 01:48:08.658
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1146
01:48:08.991 --> 01:48:13.120
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1147
01:48:17.625 --> 01:48:20.670
I'm sorry for everything.

1148
01:48:35.726 --> 01:48:39.897
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1149
01:48:41.232 --> 01:48:43.859
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1150
01:48:44.068 --> 01:48:47.196
nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1151
01:48:50.658 --> 01:48:53.202
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1152
01:48:53.661 --> 01:48:57.581
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1153
01:48:58.124 --> 01:49:00.710
and all Free Folk go with you.

1154
01:49:03.796 --> 01:49:07.883
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1155
01:49:26.318 --> 01:49:28.821
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1156
01:49:29.363 --> 01:49:31.198
Left.

1157
01:50:50.694 --> 01:50:55.115
We must hold to this course,
west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1158
01:50:55.324 --> 01:50:59.078
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1159
01:50:59.286 --> 01:51:02.832
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

1160
01:51:02.998 --> 01:51:06.836
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1161
01:51:08.671 --> 01:51:09.713
Move your feet.

1162
01:51:09.922 --> 01:51:11.257
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1163
01:51:11.465 --> 01:51:12.842
Faster!

1164
01:51:14.218 --> 01:51:18.013
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1165
01:51:18.222 --> 01:51:20.975
I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1166
01:51:21.475 --> 01:51:24.520
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1167
01:51:25.187 --> 01:51:29.024
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1168
01:51:29.358 --> 01:51:34.738
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1169
01:51:43.956 --> 01:51:45.040
Sorry!

1170
01:51:45.875 --> 01:51:47.376
Get him!

1171
01:51:48.711 --> 01:51:51.171
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1172
01:51:51.714 --> 01:51:54.049
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1173
01:51:57.845 --> 01:51:59.471
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1174
01:51:59.889 --> 01:52:02.558
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1175
01:52:02.808 --> 01:52:05.519
It's moving fast.

1176
01:52:05.728 --> 01:52:07.897
Against the wind.

1177
01:52:08.689 --> 01:52:10.816
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1178
01:52:11.025 --> 01:52:13.736
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1179
01:52:47.144 --> 01:52:48.896
Spies of Saruman.

1180
01:52:49.647 --> 01:52:52.942
The passage south is being watched.

1181
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:57.446
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1182
01:53:10.084 --> 01:53:11.794
Frodo!

1183
01:53:30.771 --> 01:53:33.023
Boromir.

1184
01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:37.486
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1185
01:53:37.695 --> 01:53:40.823
over so small a thing.

1186
01:53:44.034 --> 01:53:45.995
Such a little thing.

1187
01:53:46.203 --> 01:53:47.663
Boromir!

1188
01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:51.000
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1189
01:54:00.801 --> 01:54:02.845
As you wish.

1190
01:54:03.554 --> 01:54:05.556
I care not.

1191
01:54:40.966 --> 01:54:45.679
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1192
01:54:45.888 --> 01:54:50.476
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1193
01:54:51.769 --> 01:54:54.730
If the mountain defeats you...

1194
01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:59.401
will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1195
01:55:04.446 --> 01:55:11.446
Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!

1196
01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:11.381
Wake up cruel Redhorn!

1197
01:55:11.747 --> 01:55:13.747
There is a fell voice on the air.

1198
01:55:13.926 --> 01:55:15.926
Nai yarvaxëa rasselya!

1199
01:55:13.926 --> 01:55:15.926
May your horn be bloodstained!

1200
01:55:15.926 --> 01:55:17.427
It's Saruman!

1201
01:55:26.136 --> 01:55:30.808
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1202
01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:32.893
No!

1203
01:55:34.851 --> 01:55:41.084
[Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I 'ruith!]
Sleep Caradhras, be still,
lie still, hold your wrath!

1204
01:55:34.851 --> 01:55:40.851



1205
01:55:41.150 --> 01:55:46.150
[Cuiva nwalca Carnirassë!]
Wake up cruel Redhorn!

1206
01:55:41.150 --> 01:55:46.150



1207
01:55:46.351 --> 01:55:50.651
[Nai yarvaxëa rasselya...]
May your bloodstained horn...

1208
01:55:46.351 --> 01:55:50.651



1209
01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:54.720
[...taltuva ñotto-carinnar!]
fall upon enemy heads!

1210
01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:54.720


1211
01:56:39.334 --> 01:56:41.170
We must get off the mountain!

1212
01:56:41.670 --> 01:56:46.008
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1213
01:56:46.175 --> 01:56:49.511
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1214
01:56:49.678 --> 01:56:53.432
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1215
01:56:53.682 --> 01:56:56.518
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1216
01:56:58.353 --> 01:57:02.191
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1217
01:57:02.858 --> 01:57:07.863
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1218
01:57:08.697 --> 01:57:13.577
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

1219
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:18.373
Shadow and flame.

1220
01:57:21.710 --> 01:57:24.379
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1221
01:57:29.092 --> 01:57:31.220
We cannot stay here!

1222
01:57:31.386 --> 01:57:34.223
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1223
01:57:34.389 --> 01:57:36.099
Frodo?

1224
01:57:39.102 --> 01:57:41.980
We will go through the mines.

1225
01:57:42.731 --> 01:57:44.608
So be it.

1226
01:57:51.281 --> 01:57:55.244
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1227
01:57:58.747 --> 01:58:00.958
How is your shoulder?

1228
01:58:01.166 --> 01:58:04.419
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

1229
01:58:05.963 --> 01:58:08.465
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1230
01:58:08.966 --> 01:58:11.885
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1231
01:58:12.302 --> 01:58:16.223
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1232
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:18.976
And, I fear, from within.

1233
01:58:21.603 --> 01:58:25.774
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1234
01:58:25.941 --> 01:58:28.819
Trust your own strengths.

1235
01:58:28.986 --> 01:58:31.571
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1236
01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:33.824
for good or for evil.

1237
01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:36.285
Some are greater than I am.

1238
01:58:36.827 --> 01:58:40.455
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1239
01:58:41.832 --> 01:58:43.208
The walls...

1240
01:58:43.917 --> 01:58:46.003
of Moria.

1241
01:58:51.717 --> 01:58:54.720
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1242
01:58:54.928 --> 01:58:59.349
Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1243
01:58:59.725 --> 01:59:02.227
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1244
01:59:10.235 --> 01:59:13.530
Well, let's see.

1245
01:59:13.562 --> 01:59:14.936
Ithildin. .

1246
01:59:13.739 --> 01:59:15.115
Ithildin.

1247
01:59:15.741 --> 01:59:19.119
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1248
01:59:33.175 --> 01:59:37.262
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1249
01:59:37.846 --> 01:59:42.476
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1250
01:59:42.684 --> 01:59:47.481
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1251
01:59:47.972 --> 01:59:53.072
[Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen!]
Gate of the Elves, open now for me!

1252
01:59:47.972 --> 01:59:53.072



1253
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:03.200
[Fennas Nogothrim...]
Doorway of the dwarf-folk...

1254
02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:03.200



1255
02:00:03.774 --> 02:00:07.674
[lasto beth lammen.]
listen to the word of my tongue.

1256
02:00:03.774 --> 02:00:07.674



1257
02:00:11.213 --> 02:00:12.381
Nothing's happening.

1258
02:00:19.388 --> 02:00:23.600
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1259
02:00:23.934 --> 02:00:26.728
Men and Orcs.

1260
02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:28.260
What are you going to do, then?

1261
02:00:28.438 --> 02:00:30.690
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1262
02:00:30.941 --> 02:00:32.901
And if that does not shatter them...

1263
02:00:33.110 --> 02:00:35.821
and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1264
02:00:35.987 --> 02:00:39.449
I will try to find the opening words.

1265
02:00:43.003 --> 02:00:45.003
[Ando Eldarinwa...]
Gate of the Elves...

1266
02:00:43.003 --> 02:00:45.003

1267
02:00:46.507 --> 02:00:49.007
[a lasta quettanya...]
Listen to my word...

1268
02:00:46.507 --> 02:00:49.007

1269
02:00:49.503 --> 02:00:51.703
[Fenda Casarinwa!]
Threshold of Dwarves!

1270
02:00:49.503 --> 02:00:51.703

1271
02:00:52.295 --> 02:00:54.840
Mines are no place for a pony.

1272
02:00:55.048 --> 02:00:59.136
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1273
02:00:59.136 --> 02:01:00.436
[Fennas Nogothrim...]
Doorway of the dwarf-folk...

1274
02:00:59.136 --> 02:01:00.436

1275
02:01:00.436 --> 02:01:03.231
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1276
02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:07.185
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1277
02:01:13.984 --> 02:01:16.570
Do not disturb the water.

1278
02:01:16.778 --> 02:01:18.655
Oh, it's useless.

1279
02:01:31.334 --> 02:01:33.503
It's a riddle.

1280
02:01:36.256 --> 02:01:39.384
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1281
02:01:39.759 --> 02:01:42.679
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1282
02:01:44.139 --> 02:01:45.474
Mellon.

1283
02:02:03.492 --> 02:02:08.371
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1284
02:02:08.830 --> 02:02:14.544
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1285
02:02:16.046 --> 02:02:19.132
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1286
02:02:19.508 --> 02:02:21.885
And they call it a mine.

1287
02:02:22.093 --> 02:02:24.054
A mine!

1288
02:02:25.096 --> 02:02:28.433
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1289
02:02:32.687 --> 02:02:34.147
No.

1290
02:02:34.564 --> 02:02:36.149
No...

1291
02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:39.069
No!

1292
02:02:41.696 --> 02:02:43.240
Goblins.

1293
02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.456
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1294
02:02:52.541 --> 02:02:55.085
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1295
02:02:57.879 --> 02:03:00.257
- Frodo!
- Help!

1296
02:03:00.465 --> 02:03:02.092
Strider!

1297
02:03:02.259 --> 02:03:05.053
- Help!
- Get off him!

1298
02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:06.263
Aragorn!

1299
02:03:16.690 --> 02:03:17.732
Frodo!

1300
02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:20.485
Strider!

1301
02:03:44.092 --> 02:03:45.135
Into the mines!

1302
02:03:45.302 --> 02:03:48.513
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1303
02:03:52.809 --> 02:03:54.603
Run!

1304
02:04:11.453 --> 02:04:15.040
We now have but one choice.

1305
02:04:15.248 --> 02:04:20.128
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1306
02:04:20.378 --> 02:04:22.339
Be on your guard.

1307
02:04:22.547 --> 02:04:26.009
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1308
02:04:26.176 --> 02:04:29.721
in the deep places of the world.

1309
02:04:37.687 --> 02:04:41.650
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1310
02:04:41.816 --> 02:04:45.654
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1311
02:05:31.449 --> 02:05:35.161
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1312
02:05:35.328 --> 02:05:37.747
or jewels...

1313
02:05:37.914 --> 02:05:40.959
but mithril.

1314
02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:04.232
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1315
02:06:04.441 --> 02:06:08.403
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1316
02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:10.488
I never told him...

1317
02:06:10.655 --> 02:06:15.618
but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1318
02:06:27.964 --> 02:06:29.674
Pippin.

1319
02:06:50.361 --> 02:06:52.989
I have no memory of this place.

1320
02:06:55.074 --> 02:06:56.576
- Are we lost?
- No.

1321
02:06:56.785 --> 02:06:59.287
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1322
02:06:59.454 --> 02:07:00.914
- Merry?
- What?

1323
02:07:01.206 --> 02:07:03.166
I'm hungry.

1324
02:07:14.469 --> 02:07:18.932
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1325
02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:23.269
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1326
02:07:23.478 --> 02:07:27.649
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1327
02:07:28.316 --> 02:07:29.984
or was set loose.

1328
02:07:30.485 --> 02:07:34.155
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1329
02:07:36.783 --> 02:07:39.494
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1330
02:07:39.661 --> 02:07:45.458
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1331
02:07:45.625 --> 02:07:50.505
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1332
02:07:50.672 --> 02:07:56.636
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1333
02:07:57.512 --> 02:08:00.348
Before it drove him mad.

1334
02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.518
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1335
02:08:03.685 --> 02:08:04.894
Pity?

1336
02:08:05.979 --> 02:08:08.857
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1337
02:08:09.774 --> 02:08:14.988
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1338
02:08:16.406 --> 02:08:18.867
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1339
02:08:21.327 --> 02:08:25.290
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1340
02:08:25.498 --> 02:08:28.376
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1341
02:08:29.002 --> 02:08:34.883
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1342
02:08:35.717 --> 02:08:38.553
before this is over.

1343
02:08:40.054 --> 02:08:43.892
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1344
02:08:50.565 --> 02:08:53.902
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1345
02:08:55.361 --> 02:08:57.405
I wish none of this had happened.

1346
02:08:57.572 --> 02:09:02.619
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1347
02:09:03.411 --> 02:09:08.917
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1348
02:09:10.418 --> 02:09:14.422
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1349
02:09:14.839 --> 02:09:17.258
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1350
02:09:17.759 --> 02:09:22.096
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1351
02:09:22.263 --> 02:09:25.433
And that is an encouraging thought.

1352
02:09:28.394 --> 02:09:29.562
Ah!

1353
02:09:30.355 --> 02:09:32.273
It's that way.

1354
02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:34.776
- He's remembered.
- No.

1355
02:09:34.943 --> 02:09:38.780
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1356
02:09:38.947 --> 02:09:44.160
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1357
02:09:58.967 --> 02:10:03.137
Let me risk a little more light.

1358
02:10:07.809 --> 02:10:09.894
Behold...

1359
02:10:10.311 --> 02:10:15.525
the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1360
02:10:17.986 --> 02:10:21.447
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1361
02:10:46.347 --> 02:10:48.057
Gimli!

1362
02:10:53.855 --> 02:10:55.314
No.

1363
02:10:55.523 --> 02:10:57.150
No!

1364
02:10:59.694 --> 02:11:02.864
Oh, no.

1365
02:11:04.699 --> 02:11:05.992
No.

1366
02:11:13.249 --> 02:11:15.251
"Here lies Balin...

1367
02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:17.712
son of Fundin...

1368
02:11:18.046 --> 02:11:20.673
Lord of Moria."

1369
02:11:21.716 --> 02:11:23.384
He is dead, then.

1370
02:11:25.553 --> 02:11:26.763
It's as I feared.

1371
02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:44.500
[Kilmin malur ni zaram kalil ra narag.
Kheled-zâram... Balin tazlifi.]

1372
02:11:45.073 --> 02:11:47.992
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1373
02:11:48.201 --> 02:11:52.914
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1374
02:11:53.998 --> 02:11:56.584
We have barred the gates...

1375
02:11:57.251 --> 02:11:59.754
but cannot hold them for long.

1376
02:11:59.921 --> 02:12:02.757
The ground shakes.

1377
02:12:03.132 --> 02:12:04.759
Drums...

1378
02:12:05.093 --> 02:12:08.513
drums in the deep.

1379
02:12:12.058 --> 02:12:14.102
We cannot get out.

1380
02:12:16.104 --> 02:12:19.941
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1381
02:12:21.609 --> 02:12:24.153
We cannot get out.

1382
02:12:27.156 --> 02:12:29.117
They are coming."

1383
02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.995
Fool of a Took!

1384
02:13:14.328 --> 02:13:18.166
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1385
02:13:44.108 --> 02:13:45.735
Frodo!

1386
02:13:48.029 --> 02:13:49.530
Orcs.

1387
02:13:56.537 --> 02:13:58.539
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1388
02:14:05.838 --> 02:14:07.632
They have a cave-troll.

1389
02:14:23.397 --> 02:14:24.565
Let them come!

1390
02:14:25.066 --> 02:14:28.653
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1391
02:16:47.541 --> 02:16:50.294
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1392
02:16:55.049 --> 02:16:56.717
Frodo!

1393
02:17:30.251 --> 02:17:32.086
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1394
02:17:33.087 --> 02:17:34.964
Frodo!

1395
02:18:20.134 --> 02:18:22.011
Frodo!

1396
02:18:24.805 --> 02:18:26.265
Frodo!

1397
02:19:22.238 --> 02:19:23.531
Oh, no.

1398
02:19:31.956 --> 02:19:33.832
He's alive.

1399
02:19:36.252 --> 02:19:39.255
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1400
02:19:39.547 --> 02:19:41.757
You should be dead.

1401
02:19:41.966 --> 02:19:44.468
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1402
02:19:44.718 --> 02:19:49.473
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1403
02:19:55.271 --> 02:19:56.397
Mithril.

1404
02:19:59.191 --> 02:20:01.777
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1405
02:20:07.783 --> 02:20:09.743
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1406
02:20:24.717 --> 02:20:26.302
This way!

1407
02:21:36.705 --> 02:21:39.708
What is this new devilry?

1408
02:21:55.808 --> 02:21:58.602
A Balrog.

1409
02:21:58.894 --> 02:22:02.022
A demon of the ancient world.

1410
02:22:04.233 --> 02:22:06.694
This foe is beyond any of you.

1411
02:22:07.861 --> 02:22:09.405
Run!

1412
02:22:16.745 --> 02:22:18.247
Quickly!

1413
02:22:34.888 --> 02:22:36.140
Gandalf.

1414
02:22:36.765 --> 02:22:38.392
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1415
02:22:39.768 --> 02:22:42.271
The bridge is near.

1416
02:22:44.356 --> 02:22:48.444
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1417
02:23:17.598 --> 02:23:19.308
Gandalf!

1418
02:23:37.618 --> 02:23:38.827
Merry! Pippin!

1419
02:23:49.963 --> 02:23:51.465
Sam!

1420
02:23:54.218 --> 02:23:57.471
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1421
02:24:00.474 --> 02:24:01.934
Not the beard!

1422
02:24:15.155 --> 02:24:17.032
Steady.

1423
02:24:19.159 --> 02:24:20.828
Hold on!

1424
02:24:41.849 --> 02:24:43.058
Hang on!

1425
02:24:53.861 --> 02:24:55.571
Lean forward!

1426
02:24:58.532 --> 02:24:59.575
Steady.

1427
02:25:00.909 --> 02:25:02.077
Come on!

1428
02:25:02.327 --> 02:25:03.829
Now!

1429
02:25:21.054 --> 02:25:22.848
Over the bridge!

1430
02:25:23.056 --> 02:25:24.600
Fly!

1431
02:26:09.269 --> 02:26:11.313
You cannot pass!

1432
02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:13.106
Gandalf!

1433
02:26:17.361 --> 02:26:22.240
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1434
02:26:23.241 --> 02:26:26.995
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1435
02:26:37.005 --> 02:26:38.966
Go back to the Shadow.

1436
02:26:46.807 --> 02:26:51.269
You shall not pass!

1437
02:27:18.422 --> 02:27:22.300
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1438
02:27:29.975 --> 02:27:32.436
Fly, you fools!

1439
02:27:36.565 --> 02:27:38.734
No!

1440
02:27:44.865 --> 02:27:47.034
Aragorn!

1441
02:28:44.299 --> 02:28:47.135
Legolas, get them up.

1442
02:28:51.264 --> 02:28:53.100
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1443
02:28:53.266 --> 02:28:56.895
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1444
02:28:57.104 --> 02:29:00.440
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1445
02:29:01.316 --> 02:29:04.611
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1446
02:29:06.113 --> 02:29:08.323
On your feet, Sam.

1447
02:29:08.657 --> 02:29:10.158
Frodo?

1448
02:29:12.244 --> 02:29:13.954
Frodo!

1449
02:30:06.464 --> 02:30:09.009
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1450
02:30:09.718 --> 02:30:13.847
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1451
02:30:14.097 --> 02:30:16.641
An Elf-witch...

1452
02:30:17.184 --> 02:30:20.020
of terrible power.

1453
02:30:20.604 --> 02:30:22.814
All who look upon her...

1454
02:30:23.023 --> 02:30:24.816
fall under her spell.

1455
02:30:25.025 --> 02:30:26.318
Frodo!

1456
02:30:28.570 --> 02:30:30.614
And are never seen again.

1457
02:30:30.822 --> 02:30:35.327
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1458
02:30:35.535 --> 02:30:39.206
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

1459
02:30:39.414 --> 02:30:41.208
Mr. Frodo?

1460
02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:52.052
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1461
02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:56.848
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1462
02:31:04.522 --> 02:31:09.069
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1463
02:31:13.041 --> 02:31:16.241
[Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.]
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil. 

1464
02:31:13.041 --> 02:31:16.241



1465
02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:18.995
[Govannas vîn gwennen le,]
Our Fellowship stands in your debt,

1466
02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:18.995



1467
02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:19.932



1468
02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:19.932
[Haldir o Lórien.]

1469
02:31:22.320 --> 02:31:24.406
[A, Aragorn in Dúnedain...]
Oh, Aragorn of Dúnedain...
1470
02:31:22.320 --> 02:31:24.406


1471
02:31:24.756 --> 02:31:26.456
[istannen le ammen.]
You are known to us.

1472
02:31:24.756 --> 02:31:26.456



1473
02:31:26.456 --> 02:31:27.203
Haldir.

1474
02:31:27.254 --> 02:31:29.547
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1475
02:31:29.714 --> 02:31:31.591
Speak words we can all understand!

1476
02:31:31.758 --> 02:31:36.388
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1477
02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:39.182
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1478
02:31:39.363 --> 02:31:43.963
[Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!]
I spit upon your grave!

1479
02:31:39.363 --> 02:31:43.963



1480
02:31:46.106 --> 02:31:48.066
That was not so courteous.

1481
02:31:54.614 --> 02:31:58.618
You bring great evil with you.

1482
02:32:00.412 --> 02:32:02.622
You can go no further.

1483
02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:12.518
[Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu I ven.]
We need your protection.
The road is very dangerous!

1484
02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:12.518



1485
02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:15.820
[Merin le telim.]
I wish we may come with you.

1486
02:32:14.520 --> 02:32:15.820



1487
02:32:15.912 --> 02:32:19.032
[Henio, aníron boe ammen I dulu lîn!]
Please, understand, we need your support!

1488
02:32:15.912 --> 02:32:19.032


1489
02:32:32.546 --> 02:32:35.546
[Merin le telim.]
I wish we may come with you.

1490
02:32:32.546 --> 02:32:35.546



1491
02:32:36.603 --> 02:32:40.300
[Andelu I ven.]
The road is very dangerous.

1492
02:32:36.603 --> 02:32:40.300



1493
02:32:40.368 --> 02:32:42.995
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1494
02:32:43.663 --> 02:32:45.540
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1495
02:32:47.042 --> 02:32:50.378
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1496
02:32:51.254 --> 02:32:54.341
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1497
02:32:57.344 --> 02:32:59.346
You will follow me.

1498
02:33:11.066 --> 02:33:13.026
Caras Galadhon.

1499
02:33:13.693 --> 02:33:16.654
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1500
02:33:16.821 --> 02:33:22.494
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1501
02:34:41.489 --> 02:34:44.617
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1502
02:34:45.285 --> 02:34:50.457
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1503
02:34:52.167 --> 02:34:56.629
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1504
02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:58.673
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1505
02:34:58.882 --> 02:35:01.968
For I much desire to speak with him.

1506
02:35:02.135 --> 02:35:04.971
I can no longer see him from afar.

1507
02:35:05.805 --> 02:35:10.977
Gandalf the Grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1508
02:35:11.269 --> 02:35:13.688
He has fallen into Shadow.

1509
02:35:18.401 --> 02:35:22.906
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1510
02:35:24.532 --> 02:35:28.286
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1511
02:35:28.995 --> 02:35:32.332
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1512
02:35:34.501 --> 02:35:37.712
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1513
02:35:38.338 --> 02:35:41.674
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1514
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:50.725
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1515
02:35:51.017 --> 02:35:53.353
Gimli, son of Glóin.

1516
02:35:54.354 --> 02:35:57.857
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1517
02:35:59.359 --> 02:36:02.028
and in all lands...

1518
02:36:02.195 --> 02:36:05.698
love is now mingled with grief.

1519
02:36:18.336 --> 02:36:21.047
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1520
02:36:21.548 --> 02:36:24.551
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1521
02:36:27.554 --> 02:36:30.848
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1522
02:36:31.015 --> 02:36:34.060
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1523
02:36:34.852 --> 02:36:37.689
to the ruin of all.

1524
02:36:42.026 --> 02:36:47.865
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1525
02:36:49.409 --> 02:36:54.080
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1526
02:36:54.581 --> 02:36:58.251
for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1527
02:37:00.503 --> 02:37:02.589
Tonight, you will sleep...

1528
02:37:02.755 --> 02:37:06.217
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1529
02:37:07.760 --> 02:37:09.596
one who has seen the Eye!

1530
02:37:24.235 --> 02:37:26.779
A lament for Gandalf.

1531
02:37:34.078 --> 02:37:35.622
What do they say about him?

1532
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:38.458
I have not the heart to tell you.

1533
02:37:41.252 --> 02:37:43.463
For me, the grief is still too near.

1534
02:37:46.466 --> 02:37:49.302
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1535
02:37:49.469 --> 02:37:52.472
There should be a verse about them.

1536
02:37:56.059 --> 02:37:58.061
The finest rockets ever seen

1537
02:37:59.145 --> 02:38:01.981
They burst in stars of blue and green

1538
02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:06.361
Or after thunder, silver showers

1539
02:38:08.821 --> 02:38:11.658
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1540
02:38:11.824 --> 02:38:15.703
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1541
02:38:26.506 --> 02:38:29.175
Take some rest.

1542
02:38:29.384 --> 02:38:32.095
These borders are well-protected.

1543
02:38:32.303 --> 02:38:34.847
I will find no rest here.

1544
02:38:37.684 --> 02:38:40.687
I heard her voice inside my head.

1545
02:38:40.895 --> 02:38:44.649
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1546
02:38:44.857 --> 02:38:50.321
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1547
02:38:51.698 --> 02:38:54.534
But I cannot see it.

1548
02:38:55.868 --> 02:38:58.371
It is long since we had any hope.

1549
02:39:08.548 --> 02:39:10.675
My father is a noble man.

1550
02:39:11.426 --> 02:39:13.678
But his rule is failing...

1551
02:39:14.011 --> 02:39:19.392
and our people lose faith.

1552
02:39:20.852 --> 02:39:24.397
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1553
02:39:24.564 --> 02:39:28.067
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1554
02:39:30.903 --> 02:39:33.906
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1555
02:39:34.574 --> 02:39:36.576
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1556
02:39:36.743 --> 02:39:40.580
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1557
02:39:41.247 --> 02:39:44.751
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1558
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:49.630
Have you ever been called home...

1559
02:39:49.797 --> 02:39:53.760
by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1560
02:39:54.385 --> 02:39:57.597
I have seen the White City...

1561
02:39:57.930 --> 02:39:59.432
long ago.

1562
02:40:00.433 --> 02:40:05.396
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1563
02:40:06.314 --> 02:40:09.275
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1564
02:40:09.734 --> 02:40:13.070
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1565
02:41:20.263 --> 02:41:22.807
Will you look into the mirror?

1566
02:41:22.974 --> 02:41:24.517
What will I see?

1567
02:41:27.478 --> 02:41:29.814
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1568
02:41:30.690 --> 02:41:32.525
For the mirror...

1569
02:41:32.775 --> 02:41:35.319
shows many things.

1570
02:41:38.322 --> 02:41:40.700
Things that were...

1571
02:41:40.908 --> 02:41:43.494
things that are...

1572
02:41:44.287 --> 02:41:46.205
and some things...

1573
02:41:49.792 --> 02:41:53.087
that have not yet come to pass.

1574
02:43:15.628 --> 02:43:18.464
I know what it is you saw.

1575
02:43:20.925 --> 02:43:23.427
For it is also in my mind.

1576
02:43:25.179 --> 02:43:29.266
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1577
02:43:31.644 --> 02:43:36.482
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1578
02:43:37.149 --> 02:43:40.444
He will try to take the Ring.

1579
02:43:40.653 --> 02:43:42.655
You know of whom I speak.

1580
02:43:43.656 --> 02:43:48.327
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1581
02:43:49.829 --> 02:43:52.289
If you ask it of me...

1582
02:43:52.665 --> 02:43:55.710
I will give you the One Ring.

1583
02:43:56.794 --> 02:43:58.963
You offer it to me freely.

1584
02:44:03.509 --> 02:44:07.471
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1585
02:44:13.853 --> 02:44:17.148
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1586
02:44:17.565 --> 02:44:21.360
not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1587
02:44:22.028 --> 02:44:25.031
Treacherous as the sea!

1588
02:44:25.531 --> 02:44:30.494
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1589
02:44:30.953 --> 02:44:33.330
All shall love me...

1590
02:44:33.539 --> 02:44:36.375
and despair.

1591
02:44:50.473 --> 02:44:54.769
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1592
02:44:55.061 --> 02:44:57.521
and go into the West...

1593
02:44:57.730 --> 02:45:02.193
- and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1594
02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:09.909
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1595
02:45:10.868 --> 02:45:12.369
is to be alone.

1596
02:45:15.706 --> 02:45:18.417
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1597
02:45:18.626 --> 02:45:20.252
And I am its keeper.

1598
02:45:23.422 --> 02:45:27.093
This task was appointed to you.

1599
02:45:28.094 --> 02:45:31.013
And if you do not find a way...

1600
02:45:32.223 --> 02:45:34.225
no one will.

1601
02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.770
Then I know what I must do.

1602
02:45:38.437 --> 02:45:39.605
It's just...

1603
02:45:42.900 --> 02:45:45.111
I'm afraid to do it.

1604
02:45:48.614 --> 02:45:53.786
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1605
02:45:59.125 --> 02:46:04.839
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1606
02:46:05.631 --> 02:46:08.968
They were Elves once.

1607
02:46:10.136 --> 02:46:13.472
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1608
02:46:13.639 --> 02:46:16.809
tortured and mutilated.

1609
02:46:17.143 --> 02:46:22.481
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1610
02:46:22.773 --> 02:46:24.608
And now...

1611
02:46:26.068 --> 02:46:27.945
perfected.

1612
02:46:28.654 --> 02:46:31.824
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1613
02:46:33.784 --> 02:46:36.120
whom do you serve?

1614
02:46:36.328 --> 02:46:38.831
Saruman!

1615
02:46:59.685 --> 02:47:03.147
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1616
02:47:03.355 --> 02:47:06.233
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1617
02:47:06.483 --> 02:47:09.361
You will taste Man-flesh!

1618
02:47:14.491 --> 02:47:18.204
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1619
02:47:18.370 --> 02:47:22.541
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1620
02:47:24.376 --> 02:47:25.669
Kill the others.

1621
02:47:44.855 --> 02:47:50.277
Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1622
02:47:51.403 --> 02:47:55.241
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1623
02:48:02.414 --> 02:48:03.958
Lembas.

1624
02:48:04.208 --> 02:48:05.793
Elvish waybread.

1625
02:48:08.295 --> 02:48:11.298
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1626
02:48:17.763 --> 02:48:19.765
How many did you eat?

1627
02:48:19.932 --> 02:48:21.600
Four.

1628
02:48:27.398 --> 02:48:29.984
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1629
02:48:30.192 --> 02:48:34.280
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

1630
02:48:34.446 --> 02:48:36.949
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1631
02:48:37.199 --> 02:48:40.995
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1632
02:48:41.203 --> 02:48:46.292
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1633
02:48:54.533 --> 02:48:56.733
[Le aphadar aen.]
You are being followed. 

1634
02:48:54.533 --> 02:48:56.733



1635
02:48:58.971 --> 02:49:00.222
By river you have the chance...

1636
02:49:00.389 --> 02:49:03.600
of outrunning the enemy
to the Falls of Rauros.

1637
02:49:20.868 --> 02:49:25.664
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1638
02:49:25.956 --> 02:49:29.460
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1639
02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:37.301
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1640
02:49:37.468 --> 02:49:40.679
They have already seen service in war.

1641
02:49:40.846 --> 02:49:43.891
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1642
02:49:44.058 --> 02:49:47.353
You will find your courage.

1643
02:49:49.271 --> 02:49:51.231
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1644
02:49:51.398 --> 02:49:53.984
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1645
02:49:54.151 --> 02:49:56.278
Thank you, my lady.

1646
02:49:58.072 --> 02:50:01.408
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1647
02:50:07.873 --> 02:50:10.876
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1648
02:50:11.043 --> 02:50:13.212
Nothing.

1649
02:50:13.837 --> 02:50:17.174
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1650
02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:23.013
for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1651
02:50:30.062 --> 02:50:31.605
Actually...

1652
02:50:31.814 --> 02:50:33.399
There was one thing.

1653
02:50:34.233 --> 02:50:36.902
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1654
02:50:37.069 --> 02:50:39.905
Stupid to ask.

1655
02:50:42.408 --> 02:50:44.576
I have nothing greater to give...

1656
02:50:44.743 --> 02:50:48.330
than the gift you already bear.

1657
02:50:49.144 --> 02:50:50.944
[Am meleth dîn...]
For her love...

1658
02:50:49.144 --> 02:50:50.944



1659
02:50:51.643 --> 02:50:57.043
[I ant e guil Arwen Undómiel pígatha.]
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.

1660
02:50:51.643 --> 02:50:57.043


1661
02:50:57.790 --> 02:51:02.290


1662
02:50:57.846 --> 02:51:02.346
[Aníron I e broniatha, ad ae periatham...]
I would have her leave these shores...

1663
02:51:02.747 --> 02:51:05.947
[athar I methid en-amar hen.]
and be with her people.

1664
02:51:02.766 --> 02:51:05.966


1665
02:51:07.646 --> 02:51:13.646
[Aníron I e círatha na Valannor.]
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1666
02:51:07.646 --> 02:51:13.646


1667
02:51:13.981 --> 02:51:17.067
That choice is yet before her.

1668
02:51:17.651 --> 02:51:20.571
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1669
02:51:20.904 --> 02:51:26.743
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1670
02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:31.248
or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1671
02:51:38.348 --> 02:51:40.248
[Namárië.]
Farewell.

1672
02:51:38.348 --> 02:51:40.248


1673
02:51:43.579 --> 02:51:47.379


1674
02:51:43.579 --> 02:51:47.379
[Nadath nâ I moe cerich.]
There is much you have yet to do. 

1675
02:51:49.249 --> 02:51:53.305
[Dan...]
We...

1676
02:51:53.306 --> 02:51:54.706
[ú-'eveditham...]
Shall not meet again...

1677
02:51:53.306 --> 02:51:54.706


1678
02:51:54.897 --> 02:51:56.273
Elessar.

1679
02:51:58.817 --> 02:52:01.987
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1680
02:52:02.154 --> 02:52:05.616
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1681
02:52:06.325 --> 02:52:08.660
our most beloved star.

1682
02:52:17.836 --> 02:52:22.216
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1683
02:52:22.466 --> 02:52:26.553
when all other lights go out.

1684
02:52:35.354 --> 02:52:38.524
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1685
02:52:39.191 --> 02:52:43.487
having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1686
02:52:44.196 --> 02:52:47.533
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1687
02:52:47.824 --> 02:52:49.743
What was her gift?

1688
02:52:49.952 --> 02:52:54.873
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1689
02:52:55.666 --> 02:52:58.544
She gave me three.

1690
02:54:40.687 --> 02:54:44.149
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1691
02:54:47.861 --> 02:54:50.989
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1692
02:54:51.198 --> 02:54:54.368
But he's too clever a waterman.

1693
02:54:55.202 --> 02:54:58.497
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1694
02:54:58.664 --> 02:55:00.957
it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1695
02:55:01.124 --> 02:55:03.168
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1696
02:55:03.335 --> 02:55:06.463
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1697
02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:09.716
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1698
02:55:10.676 --> 02:55:13.679
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1699
02:55:13.845 --> 02:55:15.013
But you're not.

1700
02:55:15.305 --> 02:55:17.808
I'm here to help you.

1701
02:55:17.974 --> 02:55:19.685
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1702
02:55:25.649 --> 02:55:28.360
You can't help me, Sam.

1703
02:55:30.529 --> 02:55:32.239
Not this time.

1704
02:55:35.158 --> 02:55:37.244
Get some sleep.

1705
02:55:43.583 --> 02:55:45.711
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1706
02:55:46.211 --> 02:55:49.005
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1707
02:55:49.673 --> 02:55:51.883
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1708
02:55:52.217 --> 02:55:55.137
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1709
02:55:55.554 --> 02:55:57.556
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1710
02:55:59.433 --> 02:56:02.269
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1711
02:56:02.436 --> 02:56:05.439
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1712
02:56:05.647 --> 02:56:08.942
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1713
02:56:09.192 --> 02:56:11.403
But you will not see that.

1714
02:56:11.737 --> 02:56:13.155
You are afraid!

1715
02:56:13.405 --> 02:56:15.949
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1716
02:56:16.241 --> 02:56:19.703
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1717
02:56:22.080 --> 02:56:26.460
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1718
02:56:38.305 --> 02:56:39.681
Frodo.

1719
02:56:41.558 --> 02:56:43.059
The Argonath.

1720
02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:50.233
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1721
02:56:50.942 --> 02:56:52.903
My kin.

1722
02:58:11.857 --> 02:58:14.067
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1723
02:58:14.317 --> 02:58:16.862
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1724
02:58:17.070 --> 02:58:20.532
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1725
02:58:20.991 --> 02:58:24.828
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1726
02:58:24.995 --> 02:58:28.206
an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1727
02:58:28.415 --> 02:58:31.543
And after that, it gets even better.

1728
02:58:31.918 --> 02:58:36.882
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1729
02:58:37.048 --> 02:58:38.425
That is our road.

1730
02:58:40.010 --> 02:58:43.221
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1731
02:58:43.430 --> 02:58:45.181
Recover my...

1732
02:58:48.184 --> 02:58:50.186
- We should leave now.
- No.

1733
02:58:50.353 --> 02:58:54.816
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1734
02:58:55.025 --> 02:58:58.445
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1735
02:58:58.695 --> 02:59:02.699
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1736
02:59:03.199 --> 02:59:07.370
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1737
02:59:09.372 --> 02:59:14.336
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1738
02:59:14.836 --> 02:59:16.546
Where's Frodo?

1739
02:59:42.155 --> 02:59:44.074
None of us should wander alone.

1740
02:59:45.450 --> 02:59:47.577
You, least of all.

1741
02:59:47.786 --> 02:59:50.246
So much depends on you.

1742
02:59:51.289 --> 02:59:53.249
Frodo?

1743
03:00:00.382 --> 03:00:02.926
I know why you seek solitude.

1744
03:00:03.635 --> 03:00:07.097
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1745
03:00:07.889 --> 03:00:10.934
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1746
03:00:12.477 --> 03:00:15.146
There are other ways, Frodo.

1747
03:00:15.397 --> 03:00:19.192
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1748
03:00:19.442 --> 03:00:23.196
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1749
03:00:23.446 --> 03:00:26.491
Warning? Against what?

1750
03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:28.827
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1751
03:00:29.035 --> 03:00:32.664
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1752
03:00:32.914 --> 03:00:36.668
- don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1753
03:00:38.461 --> 03:00:41.798
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1754
03:00:43.341 --> 03:00:45.427
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1755
03:00:46.636 --> 03:00:50.306
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1756
03:00:52.142 --> 03:00:55.478
What chance do you think you have?

1757
03:00:55.645 --> 03:01:00.316
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1758
03:01:00.525 --> 03:01:04.237
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1759
03:01:06.364 --> 03:01:08.491
You fool!

1760
03:01:08.658 --> 03:01:12.662
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1761
03:01:12.829 --> 03:01:15.665
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1762
03:01:15.832 --> 03:01:17.167
- Give it to me!
- No!

1763
03:01:17.333 --> 03:01:19.169
- Give it to me!
- No.

1764
03:01:26.843 --> 03:01:28.845
I see your mind.

1765
03:01:29.054 --> 03:01:32.015
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1766
03:01:32.223 --> 03:01:34.100
You will betray us!

1767
03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:37.520
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1768
03:01:37.979 --> 03:01:41.608
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1769
03:01:48.698 --> 03:01:50.200
Frodo?

1770
03:01:54.537 --> 03:01:56.081
Frodo.

1771
03:02:00.043 --> 03:02:02.045
What have I done?

1772
03:02:02.253 --> 03:02:04.005
Please, Frodo.

1773
03:02:04.214 --> 03:02:06.883
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1774
03:02:07.092 --> 03:02:08.927
Frodo!

1775
03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:36.800
Akha - gûm

1776
03:02:36.907 --> 03:02:40.407
They will fall.

1777
03:02:37.007 --> 03:02:40.507
Ashi gurum

1778
03:02:55.431 --> 03:02:56.850
Frodo?

1779
03:02:58.101 --> 03:03:01.187
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1780
03:03:01.437 --> 03:03:03.189
Stay away!

1781
03:03:03.606 --> 03:03:05.191
Frodo!

1782
03:03:07.443 --> 03:03:11.281
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1783
03:03:20.957 --> 03:03:23.459
Would you destroy it?

1784
03:03:28.464 --> 03:03:30.383
Aragorn.

1785
03:03:33.803 --> 03:03:36.139
Aragorn.

1786
03:03:37.974 --> 03:03:39.809
Elessar.

1787
03:03:47.483 --> 03:03:50.820
I would have gone with you to the end.

1788
03:03:51.487 --> 03:03:54.324
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1789
03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:58.828
I know.

1790
03:04:01.331 --> 03:04:06.753
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1791
03:04:10.506 --> 03:04:12.217
Go, Frodo!

1792
03:04:15.220 --> 03:04:16.721
Run.

1793
03:04:17.013 --> 03:04:18.681
Run!

1794
03:04:43.206 --> 03:04:44.874
Mr. Frodo!

1795
03:04:54.175 --> 03:04:55.927
Find the halfling!

1796
03:04:57.553 --> 03:05:00.098
Find the halfling!

1797
03:05:03.559 --> 03:05:05.228
Elendil!

1798
03:05:11.734 --> 03:05:13.278
Aragorn, go!

1799
03:05:35.008 --> 03:05:36.301
Frodo!

1800
03:05:36.926 --> 03:05:38.511
Hide here. Quick!

1801
03:05:39.137 --> 03:05:40.596
Come on!

1802
03:05:43.099 --> 03:05:45.101
What's he doing?

1803
03:05:49.314 --> 03:05:51.316
He's leaving.

1804
03:05:56.112 --> 03:05:59.032
- No!
- Pippin!

1805
03:06:03.953 --> 03:06:06.289
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1806
03:06:06.831 --> 03:06:09.959
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1807
03:06:10.335 --> 03:06:11.961
- Over here!
- This way!

1808
03:06:22.805 --> 03:06:25.141
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1809
03:07:20.530 --> 03:07:23.574
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1810
03:08:06.659 --> 03:08:07.785
Run!

1811
03:11:39.372 --> 03:11:40.998
No.

1812
03:11:44.835 --> 03:11:47.880
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1813
03:11:48.172 --> 03:11:50.299
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1814
03:11:52.176 --> 03:11:53.594
I let Frodo go.

1815
03:11:54.303 --> 03:11:56.847
Then you did what I could not.

1816
03:11:57.848 --> 03:12:01.185
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1817
03:12:01.686 --> 03:12:06.023
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1818
03:12:06.190 --> 03:12:08.526
I did not see it.

1819
03:12:08.693 --> 03:12:11.862
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1820
03:12:12.363 --> 03:12:14.865
You fought bravely.

1821
03:12:15.199 --> 03:12:17.868
You have kept your honor.

1822
03:12:18.411 --> 03:12:20.371
Leave it.

1823
03:12:20.705 --> 03:12:22.707
It is over.

1824
03:12:23.916 --> 03:12:29.213
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1825
03:12:29.630 --> 03:12:32.633
and my city to ruin.

1826
03:12:36.721 --> 03:12:39.390
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1827
03:12:39.557 --> 03:12:43.561
but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1828
03:12:44.562 --> 03:12:47.064
nor our people fail.

1829
03:12:48.065 --> 03:12:49.400
Our people.

1830
03:12:53.237 --> 03:12:55.406
Our people.

1831
03:13:17.094 --> 03:13:20.097
I would have followed you, my brother.

1832
03:13:21.682 --> 03:13:23.684
My captain.

1833
03:13:26.270 --> 03:13:28.272
My king.

1834
03:13:47.917 --> 03:13:50.127
Be at peace...

1835
03:13:50.461 --> 03:13:52.463
son of Gondor.

1836
03:14:08.979 --> 03:14:12.316
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1837
03:14:12.817 --> 03:14:15.820
But he will not return.

1838
03:14:39.009 --> 03:14:41.011
Frodo!

1839
03:15:00.531 --> 03:15:03.784
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

1840
03:15:05.035 --> 03:15:08.038
I wish none of this had happened.

1841
03:15:11.041 --> 03:15:13.794
So do all who live
to see such times...

1842
03:15:14.003 --> 03:15:17.423
but that is not for them to decide.

1843
03:15:17.590 --> 03:15:20.217
All you have to decide...

1844
03:15:20.509 --> 03:15:25.222
is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1845
03:15:54.084 --> 03:15:56.086
Frodo, no!

1846
03:15:56.629 --> 03:15:57.922
Frodo!

1847
03:15:58.756 --> 03:16:01.425
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1848
03:16:04.929 --> 03:16:06.931
Go back, Sam!

1849
03:16:07.431 --> 03:16:11.060
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1850
03:16:11.268 --> 03:16:14.104
And I'm coming with you!

1851
03:16:14.563 --> 03:16:16.941
You can't swim!

1852
03:16:20.778 --> 03:16:22.446
Sam!

1853
03:16:28.077 --> 03:16:29.370
Sam!

1854
03:17:10.327 --> 03:17:12.997
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1855
03:17:13.330 --> 03:17:17.668
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1856
03:17:18.836 --> 03:17:21.422
And I don't mean to.

1857
03:17:21.672 --> 03:17:23.841
I don't mean to.

1858
03:17:25.509 --> 03:17:27.344
Sam.

1859
03:17:42.192 --> 03:17:43.861
Come on.

1860
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:16.894
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1861
03:18:31.742 --> 03:18:36.747
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1862
03:18:40.250 --> 03:18:45.089
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1863
03:18:56.934 --> 03:19:00.104
Not if we hold true to each other.

1864
03:19:01.438 --> 03:19:05.943
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1865
03:19:06.944 --> 03:19:12.241
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1866
03:19:13.450 --> 03:19:15.536
We travel light.

1867
03:19:15.744 --> 03:19:17.621
Let us hunt some Orc.

1868
03:19:20.624 --> 03:19:22.626
Yes!

1869
03:19:41.645 --> 03:19:43.063
Mordor.

1870
03:19:43.647 --> 03:19:47.067
I hope the others find a safer road.

1871
03:19:47.985 --> 03:19:50.571
Strider will look after them.

1872
03:19:51.488 --> 03:19:54.825
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1873
03:19:55.159 --> 03:19:57.661
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1874
03:19:57.828 --> 03:19:59.371
We may.

1875
03:20:01.498 --> 03:20:02.499
Sam...

1876
03:20:06.170 --> 03:20:08.797
I'm glad you are with me.

1877
03:48:05.889 --> 03:48:07.891
