1
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:18,495
Don Felipe. Don Felipe.

2
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:25,862
- Raiders, cutting out the cattle.
- It's the Marlows.

3
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:28,575
- Where are the vaqueros?
- Driving the other herd to town.

4
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:30,978
They are rushing them toward the Trinity.

5
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:15,544
Old Felipe Robles raises nice stock.

6
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,020
Won't do him no good.

7
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:28,019
How is he going to pay us the money
he owes us if we keep topping off his herd?

8
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:32,661
I don't buy mortgages to get paid back.
I buy them to foreclose.

9
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:36,405
The black soil of Dallas County
will make us rich.

10
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:39,189
We'll bleed that old buzzard broke,
huh, Cullen?

11
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:43,413
The way I say. There'll be no killing here.
Things won't be like they were in Georgia.

12
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:46,447
- We didn't do so bad in Georgia.
- Thanks to me.

13
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:49,169
Any sniping here,
I'll bust your trigger finger.

14
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,118
And that's for you, too, Bryant.
You're too quick on the draw.

15
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,720
That doesn't do my business any good.
So stay out of Dallas, understand?

16
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:59,408
Any visiting to do, I'll do it.

17
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:05,997
You boys hightail it.
I'll take care of them.

18
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,202
Raiders cutting out your cattle, Mr. Robles.
I tried to stop them.

19
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:29,964
They're your men, Will Marlow.

20
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:34,440
My men? You aren't blaming me
for all the war-bred scum in Texas?

21
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,682
Isn't my fault
Texas isn't back in the Union.

22
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,672
And there'll be lawlessness until she is.

23
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,102
The Marlow brothers and trouble
came here together.

24
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:45,453
I'm still willing to buy your land
and take my chances against the raids.

25
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:48,997
There would be no raids if you owned
the Hacienda del Norte.

26
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,157
Luis.

27
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,973
Will just got through telling you
not to do stuff like that.

28
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,883
Yeah. Yeah. Said to stay out
of Dallas, too...

29
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,020
...but I don't aim to.

30
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,828
Brave, strong...

31
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,363
...just like lizards in dark corners.

32
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:11,273
But your day of looting is almost done.

33
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:14,631
A marshal of the United States
is on his way.

34
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:27,241
Be into Springfield, Missouri
in about 10 minutes.

35
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,913
Folks traveling west or south
change coaches.

36
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:42,977
Yankee marshal?

37
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:44,484
United States Marshal.

38
00:04:44,646 --> 00:04:46,686
United States?

39
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:52,036
- All who thinks we're united, say, "Aye".
- Aye.

40
00:04:56,356 --> 00:05:00,317
I'm inviting a lady carpetbag
to set betwixt her own breed.

41
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,490
With pleasure.

42
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,616
Cold as a witch's broomstick.

43
00:05:11,457 --> 00:05:15,003
I... I'm... I'm Butterfield,
Saint Louis.

44
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,536
Dry goods, ladies' hose, and notions.

45
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,185
I'm Martin Weatherby, Boston.

46
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,838
- Stopping in Springfield?
- Momentarily.

47
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:26,302
- I have business with a William Hickok.
- Wild Bill?

48
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:29,244
- Greatest marshal ever lived.
- Yeah, I hear Bill's retiring.

49
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,861
- Ain't got no competition left.
- You say.

50
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,844
I saw he's scared he'll meet up
with Reb Hollister.

51
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:39,380
- That desperado?
- Desperado, you say? Patriot, say I.

52
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:43,345
Maybe Lee surrendered,
but not old Georgia Reb. No, sir.

53
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:46,963
He's a one-man war,
still marching on.

54
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:22,227
Stage for the West leaves in 30 minutes.
Them that want vittles better hurry.

55
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,987
Great day in the morning.

56
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:41,772
It is pleasant.

57
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:45,385
There he is, boy.
The pride of Vicksburg.

58
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:49,447
The terror of Kansas.
That's Blayde Hollister.

59
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,511
You mean to say that a common outlaw
can walk the streets like that?

60
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,837
- Is there no law enforcement here?
- There's the law, Wild Bill Hickok.

61
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:32,390
- Hickok, I have a letter to present to you...
- Duck.

62
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,893
Spoiled the party for you boys.

63
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,484
I guess that settles
who's running this town.

64
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,248
I'll take that.

65
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:59,389
Mister, bring his horse.

66
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,893
- Nice shooting, marshal.
- Yes, sir. Shot him dead.

67
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:04,442
Well, if he ain't,
we'll put the hemp to him.

68
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:16,922
Here. Take your carrion out of town.

69
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,545
- Well, go on. Don't stand there gawking.
- Just a minute.

70
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,602
- I had nothing to do with this.
- Get going.

71
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:24,348
- We heard you give that rebel yell.
- You're quite mistaken.

72
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:27,711
- I have a letter of introduction...
- Boys, you wanted a hanging party...

73
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,045
...here's a warm one for you.

74
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:35,514
- Good riddance.
- Just maybe the town will settle down now.

75
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,298
Ruined my Sunday go-to-meeting hat.

76
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,018
Keep going, blue-belly,
or I'll fry you for breakfast.

77
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,614
This may not be my official district...

78
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,910
...but you've fallen into the hands
of a United States Marshal.

79
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:11,481
You like your bacon lean or fat?

80
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:16,344
As soon as I've eaten, I intend to take you
back to Springfield, to the authorities.

81
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:23,412
- What's the matter?
- Like Hickok said: Duck.

82
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:27,407
Thieving varmint. That a way
to return a favor? Stealing my hat?

83
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:30,444
You dang blasted showoff,
you cost me my best six-shooter.

84
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:32,369
Now, hold on, Reb.

85
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:35,829
I wouldn't stoop to such dirty doings,
carting off your relics...

86
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,285
...advertising I shot them off
Reb Hollister.

87
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:47,724
Now, where's my hat?

88
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,704
Well, I tell you, Bill,
there's a little boy I know...

89
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:58,030
...who'd be mighty proud
to have Wild Bill Hickok's hat.

90
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:02,863
Well, now.
That's a real nice thought, Reb.

91
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:07,884
- Want me to autograph it for the kid?
- Your initials are in it. That's good enough.

92
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:11,048
- Have some vittles.
- No. I gotta be getting back to town.

93
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:13,769
- The fight look convincing?
- Whole town ate it up.

94
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:17,678
- You're dead as a doornail.
- You sure untied my hands, Bill.

95
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,187
It'll make life a lot easier for me,
Reb Hollister being dead.

96
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:24,293
- Aren't you going to arrest him?
- Oh, forgot about you.

97
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:26,185
I'm sorry I had to tin-can you,
mister.

98
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,211
I had to move Reb out of town before those
yahoos found out we was just play-acting.

99
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:33,697
Besides, I was afraid that getup
you're wearing might start more shooting.

100
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,553
- Preposterous.
- It sure is.

101
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:38,179
I'm speaking of your dereliction of duty.
I'm informed...

102
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:41,479
You're informed?
And who or what might you be?

103
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:44,742
- My name is Weatherby, Boston.
- He's a United States Marshal.

104
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:47,077
- It ain't possible.
- On the contrary, I have a...

105
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:50,918
- Hit something.
- Wh...? What for?

106
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:53,665
Well, Bill's a man that needs convincing.

107
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,976
Marshal, I'm glad I met you
while you were still with us.

108
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:22,719
You're gonna be
the shortest-lived marshal on record.

109
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,169
As I tried to explain this afternoon,
I have a letter from the Attorney General.

110
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:33,503
You're to accompany me
to Dallas County, in Texas.

111
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,325
Brigands are terrorizing
the district.

112
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:36,952
- Brothers.
- What's their name?

113
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:38,497
Is it the Marlow brothers?

114
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:41,023
Well, yes. Yes, that's it.
Evidently, a poetic family.

115
00:11:41,185 --> 00:11:44,348
There's a Bryant Marlow, a William Marlow,
and a Longfellow.

116
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:46,455
- Cullen?
- Yes, that's it.

117
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,031
You know them?

118
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:50,134
I've never seen them.

119
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:54,485
These are orders, Hickok.
Your patriotic duty demands...

120
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:57,339
Sonny, there are duty scars
all over my hide.

121
00:11:57,503 --> 00:12:00,317
From now on, folks are gonna buy tickets
just to look at them...

122
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,650
...on the stage of a theater.

123
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,042
You mean you're
going to be an actor?

124
00:12:06,748 --> 00:12:07,959
Why not?

125
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:10,742
You're what marshaling
has petered down to.

126
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:15,218
Folks will be glad to pay
to see the genuine, hairy specimen.

127
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,183
Happy hunting, marshal.
The law is in your purty hand.

128
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:23,577
Marshal, this... This outlaw.

129
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:25,200
If you don't arrest him,
I shall.

130
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:26,548
Outlaw?

131
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:28,569
Let me tell you something, son.

132
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,809
This ain't Boston.

133
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:34,068
We had a war down here. You'll find men
in high office who are thieves, cutthroats.

134
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:38,257
You'll find others who are branded outlaws
that are only fighting for what's their own.

135
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:42,737
There's those known as bad men
and those as are bad men.

136
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:45,358
You better learn to tell the difference.

137
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,364
- Hey, where are you going?
- With you.

138
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,150
What, to Dallas?

139
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:02,033
Well, Hickok's out of circulation,
ain't he?

140
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:04,905
You mean that you'd
take Mr. Hickok's place?

141
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,109
- Why not?
- Why, I don't know you, Mr. Hollister.

142
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:10,446
You're branded as an outlaw,
a Southern guerrilla.

143
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,749
Though I can see merit
in what Mr. Hickok says.

144
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:15,435
Heaven knows you're more capable
than I, but...

145
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:18,765
- Oh, to make you my deputy.
- You still haven't got the hang of it.

146
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,271
I beg your pardon?

147
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:23,532
I'm not gonna be your deputy.
You're gonna be mine.

148
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:27,852
You're not known in Dallas. Neither am I.
So I'll be Marshal Weatherby.

149
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,917
Nothing new in that idea.
A regular custom up north, I understand.

150
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,804
Hiring other people to do
your fighting for you.

151
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:37,894
I was at Chickamauga, Mr. Hollister.
My brother was at Gettysburg.

152
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:40,999
Well, you're something brand-new
in carpetbaggers.

153
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:44,165
Well, anyway, you can forget about
the Marlows. One of them, anyway.

154
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,854
You just swear me in,
and I'll kill off Bryant for you...

155
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:49,258
...all in the name
of the United States government.

156
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:52,006
There's to be no bloodshed.
I merely want them apprehended.

157
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:55,684
- Apprehended? Bryant Marlow?
- Yes.

158
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:59,047
You remember that little boy
I was telling Wild Bill about?

159
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,664
You're him, bub.

160
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,589
Boston bean.

161
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:23,749
I look like a Yankee cod,
but I hope I don't smell like one.

162
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,277
Might be an improvement
over a Johnny Reb.

163
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:29,252
Take it easy, blue-belly.
You're lucky I stomached you this far.

164
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:31,835
But that's the way it's got to be.

165
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,434
You're me, but I'm not you.

166
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:37,346
And... And when you're talking to me,
you're talking to yourself.

167
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,396
When I'm speaking to you...

168
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:43,647
...it's not me
I'm speaking to, it's... It's you.

169
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:46,199
Well, anyhow, you get the idea.

170
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:49,116
Anyway, I hope I can pass
for a railroading Weatherby.

171
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:52,762
You look that part more than
I look like Bill Hickok's downfall.

172
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:57,815
Only a Yankee tailor would outfit a feller
this way to ride across Texas.

173
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:11,928
I may as well tell you, I got into this
only to impress my fiancée.

174
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,324
Well, you can write back to Boston
and tell her all about it.

175
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:18,136
- She lives here.
- Why?

176
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:21,076
She only came to Boston to visit me.

177
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:26,005
Her name is Antonia Robles.
She's very lovely.

178
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:31,419
- You ain't all Boston.
- What do you mean by that?

179
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:35,226
Codfish ain't known for warm blood.

180
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:40,468
I haven't met her family yet.
They're in cattle.

181
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:43,763
It seems they're involved in a land war,
so to speak...

182
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,540
...harassed by those Marlow ruffians.

183
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:02,390
Keep your hand off that gun.
We're looking for the Robles' place.

184
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:05,866
- Robles?
- Where is it? I'm the new marshal.

185
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:09,716
You are there.

186
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,448
Follow me, señores.

187
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,228
Don Felipe.

188
00:17:05,515 --> 00:17:09,344
- This isn't the reception I'd expected.
- You are strangers.

189
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:12,003
I hope Tonia's more pleased to see me
than her father.

190
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:16,393
- Now, wait a minute...
- Antonia? Then you... You are Martin?

191
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:20,449
Do forgive me. You would be welcome
under any circumstances.

192
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:25,346
But coming as you do,
the marshal of the United States.

193
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:28,098
Antonia has told us so much.

194
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:32,322
I beg your forgiveness,
and welcome to Hacienda del Norte.

195
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:44,900
Let me present my son, Luis.

196
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,251
Luis.

197
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,652
I apologize for my son.

198
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,203
<i>It was norteños, men from the North,
that crippled him.</i>

199
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:57,273
<i>Oh, I understand how he feels about
norteños, as you call them.</i>

200
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,963
We call them carpetbaggers.

201
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:04,609
Oh, I forgot. Don Felipe, my brother,
Daniel Weatherby.

202
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,493
- Daniel?
- From the lion's den.

203
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:08,894
Father was a great Bible student.

204
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:14,041
- How do you do?
- Antonia made no mention of your brother.

205
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:18,464
Well, I didn't tell her about him, black sheep
of the family. Father kept him hidden.

206
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:25,496
- Martin.
- Tonia.

207
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,972
Tonia.

208
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:31,160
- Tonia, dear Tonia.
- Martin.

209
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:35,637
<i>No, no, no. Leave them alone
un momento together.</i>

210
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,079
You are Tonia, aren't you?

211
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:50,516
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm not Martin.

212
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:52,471
I know that.

213
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:56,631
But on the other hand, I am Martin.
Martin's my brother.

214
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,488
Hey, Daniel. Come in here.

215
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:09,428
Oh, Tonia, darling.

216
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:12,012
Martin, why have you brought
this crazy one with you?

217
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:15,444
Oh, Señorita Robles, Mr. Hollister.

218
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,864
You overdid that, Reb.
You didn't have to be so convincing.

219
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:21,418
I had to hush her up.

220
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,266
- Martin, answer me. Why is he here?
- To ensure success against the Marlows.

221
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:26,738
He's my deputy.

222
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:28,428
Or rather, I seem to be his.

223
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:32,109
Whatever he is, he needs a tight rein.

224
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,705
He needs a drink.

225
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:41,482
It's hard to explain, but it's important
that he be known here as Martin Weatherby.

226
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,262
No one except you must know who he is.
He has enemies.

227
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,018
This I can understand.

228
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:50,378
For your information,
I'll soon have fewer.

229
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:53,894
My interest in these parts
is the Marlow brothers.

230
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,858
My family must be told who you are.
They can be trusted.

231
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:06,251
That gringo-loving brother of yours?
Don't mislead yourself, young lady.

232
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,842
No gringo could be his friend.

233
00:20:08,014 --> 00:20:10,380
Tonia, you must trust him.
He's come here to help us.

234
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:15,178
It won't be too long a hardship, señorita.
I promise.

235
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,178
I never expected a deputy fiancé.

236
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:23,466
Martin was right.
You are very lovely.

237
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:28,424
And so is the Hacienda del Norte.

238
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:44,256
Good green land fit for cotton.
Got a nice, easy roll to it like...

239
00:20:53,223 --> 00:20:55,045
Like your home?

240
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:57,247
I have no home.

241
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,618
You are Martin's friend.
This is your home.

242
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,682
Well, let's apprehend them.

243
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:47,677
Never launch an attack, Yankee,
until you know the tactical situation.

244
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:50,107
You learn that at Vicksburg, rebel?

245
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:53,780
Foreigner. I'll make it simple
so you can understand.

246
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:56,948
The best place to reconnoiter
is where the barleycorn flows.

247
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:01,143
I'm raring.

248
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:05,075
I can lick any man in the place.

249
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,880
- Howdy. What's your undoing, gents?
- Straight Kentucky.

250
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,054
I never drink before 5.

251
00:22:23,223 --> 00:22:24,717
Set that glass right-side up.

252
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,123
- Why?
- Like I told you, turn it over.

253
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:31,116
By Godfrey, another one
wanting to lick every man in town.

254
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:34,101
- I said nothing of the sort.
- You turned your glass upside down.

255
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:37,077
- Let me cool this one.
- Wait, Dan. Don't draw.

256
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:42,194
That hat my brother's wearing,
he shot it off of Bill Hickok.

257
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:47,024
Yes, sir. There's Wild Bill's initials
right in the sweatband.

258
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,451
Dirty Dan here, he sure
cut the map of Kansas...

259
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,823
- ... through the old buffalo's hair.
- Sure enough?

260
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:54,125
That don't give him no call
to be so overbearing.

261
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,064
Bear with him, boys. A thing like that
goes to a young fellow's head.

262
00:22:58,258 --> 00:23:00,200
Set them up, bartender.
The drinks are on me.

263
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,981
- My name's Weatherby.
- Weatherby? You're the new marshal.

264
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:07,941
Say, been expecting you.
New marshal's here.

265
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:11,117
New marshal's here.

266
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:16,390
New marshal's here.
Hey, folks. New marshal's here.

267
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,233
What'd you say your name was, marshal?

268
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:25,641
Weatherby. Why?

269
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:28,424
Seems to me I've seen you before.

270
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:29,898
You haven't.

271
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:32,679
Coulter's my name, Bar W Ranch.

272
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:36,488
Welcome, marshal. Welcome.
I'm Judge Harper of the federal district.

273
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:39,591
You haul in the culprits, marshal.
He'll jail them.

274
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:42,623
When the evidence warrants it,
Mr. Walters.

275
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:52,648
Evidence? Why, everybody knows
the Marlow boys...

276
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,336
...are back of all this plundering.

277
00:23:54,504 --> 00:23:56,893
Nobody's seen them breaking the law.

278
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:58,406
Particular, aren't you?

279
00:23:58,568 --> 00:24:01,219
Dallas will be run by federal law,
not by mob rule.

280
00:24:01,384 --> 00:24:04,579
We're not wild Westerners.
We're facing east, and that's our future.

281
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,557
We intend to build industries here
and culture.

282
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:09,507
Dallas will raise people, not cows.

283
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,669
If your carpetbag riffraff doesn't
choke her to death in her cradle.

284
00:24:12,838 --> 00:24:14,780
This seems a matter
for community action.

285
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,633
Back home, when faced with any problem
we had a town meeting.

286
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:19,804
I suggest we call one.
Where's your town hall?

287
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:24,030
- Yes, every town should have a town hall.
- We ain't got around to building one yet.

288
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,018
Well, I'll speak to Will Marlow about it.

289
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,081
Your judge here seems to think
he's a model citizen.

290
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:34,263
If you're gonna fool around over there,
you better take Dirty here with you.

291
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:36,376
Yeah. He ought to be marshal.

292
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:38,903
He sure ought to.

293
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:45,978
I told you to keep your mud tracks
out of Dallas.

294
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:50,235
Now you're here, and you even
dragged these pack rats in.

295
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,309
It gets lonesome out there
in the barrancas.

296
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,789
Then go buy yourself a bottle.

297
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:57,115
I never worried about your not having
something to keep you company.

298
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,344
Which one of you is Bryant Marlow?

299
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,659
- Who are you?
- My name's Weatherby.

300
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,107
Marshal.

301
00:25:10,012 --> 00:25:12,794
I told you I'm not interested
in buying any property right now.

302
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:16,251
You can take your deal somewheres else.
Don't bother me.

303
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:23,351
I'm Will Marlow. Sit down, marshal.

304
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:31,279
You ain't trailing my worthless brother,
are you, marshal?

305
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:32,975
I didn't say that.

306
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:34,900
I'm in the market
for some real estate.

307
00:25:35,064 --> 00:25:37,999
I thought I might be accommodating
the new marshal with a dwelling.

308
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,403
I even heard they might send
Bill Hickok down here.

309
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,284
Bill? Oh, he's fired his last shot
for the law.

310
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:44,625
He got drilled?

311
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:47,507
Fought it out
with a fellow named Hollister.

312
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:50,294
Hol...?

313
00:25:50,454 --> 00:25:51,565
Where is he?

314
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:54,515
Hickok? He's retired. He's on his way
east to do some play-acting.

315
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:56,531
No, Hollister, Reb Hollister.
Where is he?

316
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:59,726
- Oh, he's dead.
- Come on, we'd better get out of here.

317
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,713
- You sure?
- Hickok had it all his own way.

318
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:04,745
I just happened to be there
when Hollister was laid out cold.

319
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:09,288
This calls for a bottle of bonded.
We owe Wild Bill a drink.

320
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:13,549
Well, my call isn't social.
I wanna buy a building for a town hall.

321
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:16,583
I suppose you know a valid deed
when you see one.

322
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:22,604
Marshal, you don't need to worry where
Will Marlow and legalities are concerned.

323
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,288
Well, here's 500 on account.

324
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:27,943
I'll post the balance
of 10,000 at the bank...

325
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:30,500
...to be delivered by me
when you produce a deed.

326
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,064
Ten thousand?

327
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,321
- Ten thousand?
- That's a big bundle.

328
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,093
You happen to know of a good
ready-made hall?

329
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:51,075
Yep. Know one would make a dandy.

330
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:57,540
If I was to manipulate Bill Walters' head
in front of that top O in "saloon"...

331
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:59,495
...could you let air in it?

332
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:05,346
- Ain't nobody could make a shot like that.
- Especially not from here.

333
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:09,826
Bill Walters got some horses
I been wanting to trade for.

334
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:16,006
You know, I never expected to find
a marshal with so much civic spirit.

335
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:28,190
Been to Georgia lately, Mr. Marlow?

336
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,460
I've never been in Georgia.

337
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:35,106
- You have, Bryant.
- That ain't Bryant.

338
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:38,583
Meet Jason Trask, my handy boy.

339
00:27:39,396 --> 00:27:43,738
- Well, here's to Bill Hickok.
- Here's to all good marshals.

340
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:49,024
You're doing your duty when you hunt
the likes of my brother Bryant.

341
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:54,263
You know, Mr. Weatherby here's likely
to be the ruination of your job, Jason.

342
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:56,222
Honest citizens
don't need a bodyguard...

343
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,905
...when there's a marshal around,
fit to keep the law.

344
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:12,659
Looks like one of them longhorns
got Bill Walters.

345
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,269
Poor old Bill.

346
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:19,380
You know, I've knowed
a lot worse skunks.

347
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:23,226
Odd happenstance. Walters' place
would make a fine town hall.

348
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:26,138
- Yeah.
- Who asked you?

349
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:31,448
- Gun's still warm.
- What gu...?

350
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:33,683
Don't cock that hammer,
you crazy coot.

351
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:36,239
Why not? Works good this way.

352
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,809
What's your name?

353
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:43,537
It's still cocked.

354
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,311
We're riding out. Coming?

355
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,364
Have you got no brains?

356
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:56,397
Shooting from this office,
smearing your filth on me.

357
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:57,810
Get out, you and your scum.

358
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:00,429
Take the back stairs,
and don't come back.

359
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,840
- What happened up there?
- I just spent 10,000 of your money.

360
00:29:16,436 --> 00:29:18,989
Cullen, get that dude!

361
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,775
Keep a keen eye, Dirty.

362
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:40,169
You did this to Cullen.

363
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:44,492
You're tempting me, Bryant,
every second you're in my sight.

364
00:29:46,415 --> 00:29:49,131
Come out of there, all of you,
with your fingers in your ears!

365
00:29:49,294 --> 00:29:52,489
Wired trigger. Bryant Marlow's gun.

366
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:54,850
I should've known that.

367
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:40,000
My own brother Bryant...

368
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:43,164
...he's been a cloud on me
everywhere I tried to go.

369
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:46,529
Looks like an honest man
hasn't got a chance.

370
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:48,511
I tried to hold him for you, marshal...

371
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:51,229
...but he led Cullen wrong
and got him killed.

372
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:53,119
You done right...

373
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,713
...marshal.

374
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:56,923
You only followed duty.

375
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,873
I'll help Dallas
to set the noose around him.

376
00:31:02,242 --> 00:31:03,900
I'll give a reward for his capture.

377
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:08,056
I'll pay my tithes
to set this county free.

378
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,109
- Marshal.
- Quiet. Don't let them know I'm shot.

379
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,403
Get the horses. Gotta get out of town
without advertising it.

380
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,615
Should've taken you
straight to a doctor.

381
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:34,709
That's how you lost Bull Run, Yankee:
Letting the enemy know your casualty.

382
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:39,066
He's right. It's best the Marlows
detect no weaknesses.

383
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:43,318
Don't worry. We are good doctors here.
We had to be.

384
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:45,201
What a brave one.

385
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,891
<i>The valiente who was
to remove the Marlows.</i>

386
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:49,302
You had your chance
at Will.

387
00:31:49,467 --> 00:31:52,249
Why didn't you shoot first
and ask questions afterwards?

388
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:55,993
- Or is it that you're afraid?
- Luis.

389
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:59,282
- Go from this room.
- Let the little scorpion stay.

390
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:01,588
He's right. I was afraid.

391
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,199
Afraid I'd die
and leave Bryant Marlow alive.

392
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:09,270
I can't die, not until he's dead.

393
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:12,081
I'd give much
to be able to believe you.

394
00:32:16,758 --> 00:32:20,467
- My brother wasn't always like that.
- He has a nasty bite.

395
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,688
Don't blame him. You'd be bitter, too,
if you were in his place.

396
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:28,114
Amelia, the iron.

397
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:35,939
Martin.

398
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:37,283
Let's face it, Tonia...

399
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:39,652
...Boston was one place
but this is another.

400
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:42,628
- Are you sorry you came?
- No, I didn't say that.

401
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:46,468
But every day I realize more that I've walked
into a world of which I know nothing.

402
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:52,415
- Could go back to your world, Martin.
- And admit I'm licked?

403
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:54,622
How long would I keep your love then?

404
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,699
I came here to take care of you...

405
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,047
...and I'll do it.

406
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:02,714
Martin.

407
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:06,618
That's for trying.

408
00:34:06,788 --> 00:34:10,464
But learning to shoot like Mr. Hickok
won't help if you get sunstroke.

409
00:34:10,627 --> 00:34:12,034
Here.

410
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,119
Duck!

411
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:48,475
Here comes Will.

412
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,514
Welcome, brother.
You can take over now.

413
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:02,009
I've had me a bellyful
of this coyote music...

414
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:03,829
...and I ain't just a bird cooing.

415
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:06,482
You'll stay here and like it.
That marshal's after you...

416
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,559
...so you pull a murder
for an introduction.

417
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:11,063
Harper says your gun's evidence enough
to hang you.

418
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:14,291
And I had to do plenty fast-talking
to keep myself out of your mess.

419
00:35:15,288 --> 00:35:17,557
You and your talking.

420
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,902
If you'd done it my way, we'd be
living in the Robles' hacienda by now.

421
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,258
Hacienda, he says.

422
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:33,292
So I wind up living in a dirt-floor parlor.

423
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:36,658
- It's not your first one.
- Shut his mouth for him, Bryant.

424
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:39,602
Tell him what you said.
Tell him who's gonna be boss.

425
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,903
Boss? So that's it.

426
00:35:42,068 --> 00:35:43,890
Do you want me to take a trip?

427
00:35:44,052 --> 00:35:45,262
What for?

428
00:35:45,428 --> 00:35:47,053
I might drop by some Army post.

429
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:50,993
Military always been interested what
happened to the Hollisters over in Georgia.

430
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:54,375
You was guiltier than I was.

431
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:57,099
- You're the one...
- To cover you, you trigger-crazy...

432
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:59,054
You leave evidence, Bryant. I don't.

433
00:35:59,218 --> 00:36:01,389
That's why I could
give evidence against you.

434
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:04,432
But you're the only one that could.

435
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:06,054
She can now.

436
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:07,624
Can you handle her?

437
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,908
You'd better mind, Will. We don't want
no Cains or Abels on our souls.

438
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,722
- No Lot's wife either.
- Take it easy.

439
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,407
- Nobody has to get hurt.
- Except that marshal.

440
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:19,818
And I'll take care of him.

441
00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:22,568
Last time you tried to take care of things,
you lost a gun.

442
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:25,864
Leave him to me.
I still got him on the hook for $ 10,000.

443
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:27,207
Town hall, remember?

444
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:31,594
If you know what's good for you, you just
keep putting the spurs to old Robles.

445
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:51,551
Martin...

446
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:57,092
...who is he?

447
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,010
He's a wanted criminal.

448
00:37:24,163 --> 00:37:26,366
Is that such a blow to you, Tonia?

449
00:37:30,946 --> 00:37:32,801
He's our friend.

450
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:37,310
I had to know the truth. I coded
a message to the Attorney General.

451
00:37:37,473 --> 00:37:41,085
The government says he's carried on
guerrilla action but I've got his record.

452
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:44,990
I know who his victims were:
Carpetbaggers, men like Will Marlow.

453
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,659
I should arrest him, but how can I
when I know that if the South had won...

454
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:51,252
...and men had dug
their hobnails into us...

455
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:54,237
...I'd have been an outcast too.

456
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:58,109
I wish now I'd never laid eyes on him.

457
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,025
Why do you say that?

458
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:04,280
I'm a fool. I'm trying to arrange
a pardon for him.

459
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:06,331
- If I succeed...
- Have you told him?

460
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,564
Oh, no. Nor can you.

461
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:10,707
Hopes can be brutal, Tonia...

462
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,757
...if they don't materialize.

463
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:01,872
How's things in Dallas?

464
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:08,775
I saw Señora Walters.

465
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,374
She will do as you say.

466
00:39:10,545 --> 00:39:11,789
And Bryant Marlow?

467
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:14,801
Like you, he stays out of sight.

468
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:17,994
Thanks for the loan of your horse.

469
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:32,234
- Where are you going?
- Hunting.

470
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:34,569
- You're not well enough to ride.
- I'm fine.

471
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:38,050
You can't arrest Bryant Marlow alone,
not with that pack he has around him.

472
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:40,360
Arresting's your idea.

473
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:42,564
Well, I lose my bet.

474
00:39:42,732 --> 00:39:43,910
- What bet?
- With myself.

475
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:47,175
- Once you started serving your country...
- I have no country.

476
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,209
- And you call me "foreigner".
- You and all blue-belly.

477
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:52,419
We washed your gray
and hung it out to dry.

478
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:54,147
Not mine, Yankee.

479
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:57,413
If you wanna try, just send
for that Gettysburg brother of yours.

480
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,618
He's still at Gettysburg.

481
00:40:02,697 --> 00:40:06,079
Well, I guess I'm wearing a good name.
Had one of my own once.

482
00:40:06,249 --> 00:40:10,525
Small pumpkins maybe, compared to
the railroading Weatherbys, but it set well.

483
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:12,132
It meant "cotton. "

484
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:16,675
I been talking in my sleep.

485
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:22,306
Soil around here would grow better cotton
than ever came out of Georgia.

486
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:25,765
- You ought to put a bug in Felipe's ear.
- I've got a bug in my own.

487
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,346
I want to get a railroad headed this way.

488
00:40:28,581 --> 00:40:31,876
This is a big country, Reb.
You said so yourself.

489
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:36,125
Cotton, railroads.
Weatherby, Hollister.

490
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:39,325
Dreams, fried up, short order.

491
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:41,018
Must they be dreams?

492
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:42,877
You know what "Texas" means?

493
00:40:43,043 --> 00:40:44,898
It's an Indian word for "friend. "

494
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:47,808
It's a big land with room for everyone.

495
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,596
You could be a part of it, in time.

496
00:40:49,762 --> 00:40:53,111
Time? That's for you two love-doves.

497
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:55,807
The space of a lifetime to be together.

498
00:40:56,448 --> 00:40:58,837
I've got no time.
For me, time's running out.

499
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:11,260
- What's up?
- Señor, she says...

500
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:13,015
I wanna talk to Marshal Weatherby.

501
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:16,051
- Well, who are you?
- Mrs. Walters, Mrs. Bill Walters.

502
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:18,236
I'm the marshal. What's wrong?

503
00:41:18,398 --> 00:41:21,560
That Bryant Marlow, bullying
and threatening for his brother Will.

504
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:25,520
He's bringing a bill of sale out tonight,
made for me to sign away Bill's leavings.

505
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,625
- Where?
- At my house, right outside of Dallas.

506
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:31,512
- Well, I'll go with you.
- Bless you.

507
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:42,488
- Who was it?
- Señora Walters.

508
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,584
Señora Walters? Impossible.
I just left her in Dallas.

509
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,173
- Then who...?
- I don't know.

510
00:41:48,344 --> 00:41:49,554
Carlos.

511
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,126
Carlos...

512
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:52,367
...call the vaqueros.

513
00:41:52,535 --> 00:41:54,477
Find the marshal
and tell him the woman lied.

514
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:56,688
Alberto! Manuel!

515
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:15,245
Higher.

516
00:42:15,443 --> 00:42:17,068
Higher.

517
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:30,987
Nice work, Flo.

518
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:33,895
Get down off that horse.

519
00:42:36,816 --> 00:42:39,020
Just raring to ride, huh?

520
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:41,965
Yeah, too much "giddap"
and not enough "whoa. "

521
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,817
I knew you weren't Mrs. Walters.

522
00:42:43,983 --> 00:42:45,576
Figured I'd gamble on a lead.

523
00:42:46,126 --> 00:42:48,679
Remember how you poured it into Cullen?

524
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:50,340
You're rushing me, but I'll try.

525
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:51,883
Just take your time.

526
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:55,623
I never did like to eat
my striped candy too quick.

527
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:00,936
Scared?

528
00:43:01,196 --> 00:43:03,301
Bumps like an alligator.

529
00:43:11,594 --> 00:43:13,765
You shoot,
and you will draw them in here.

530
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,068
Let them chase an empty saddle.

531
00:43:40,102 --> 00:43:42,076
Slippery as a greased hog, ain't you?

532
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,935
But it ain't gonna gain you nothing.

533
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,067
Pop that gun off, it'll cost you $ 10,000.

534
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:49,855
- What are you talking about?
- The town hall.

535
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,223
I posted my cashier's check
with the bank.

536
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:55,932
Will gets it when he comes in
with the deed, if I sign the release.

537
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:57,626
Don't you bite on that.

538
00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,188
No Marshal Weatherby, no 10,000.

539
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:02,492
And Will
will just skin you alive.

540
00:44:02,657 --> 00:44:05,145
- If you don't plug him, I will.
- Let him have it, lummox.

541
00:44:05,313 --> 00:44:07,452
Oh, shut up. I'm trying to think what...

542
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:09,951
What Will would do
if he was doing the thinking.

543
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:13,015
It's a good gamble, Bryant.
My life against a wad of money.

544
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,862
I'll just ride out of here...

545
00:44:20,735 --> 00:44:22,677
...nice and easy...

546
00:44:24,127 --> 00:44:26,134
...while you're thinking.

547
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:32,724
Will will call down
fire and brimstone on you.

548
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,448
What would Will do?

549
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:41,306
Well, what am I worrying about Will for?
It's me he's got the evidence on.

550
00:44:41,468 --> 00:44:43,889
I'm worth more than $ 10,000 to me!

551
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,847
You'd get your pockets picked
in a graveyard.

552
00:44:53,018 --> 00:44:54,511
Sap-sucking yahoo.

553
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,346
He won't get far in this brush
on my horse.

554
00:46:25,514 --> 00:46:28,099
Reno. Reno, boy.

555
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:30,153
Reno.

556
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:38,885
Gerry, you and Bill
circle this thicket here.

557
00:46:39,048 --> 00:46:42,527
Rest of you, fan out
but don't let him get away.

558
00:46:45,766 --> 00:46:47,457
Reno, boy.

559
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:49,440
Reno.

560
00:46:56,933 --> 00:46:58,493
Reno.

561
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,290
Hey, fellas, Reno throwed him!
He's afoot!

562
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,599
Come on, root him out!

563
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:31,999
Hey.

564
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:38,709
Hey! Help! Get over here!

565
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:41,331
Think you're smart, don't you?

566
00:47:43,646 --> 00:47:45,500
Hey, you fellas, get over here!

567
00:47:45,885 --> 00:47:47,640
Hey!

568
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,842
Hey, you fellas, get in here.
Come on, cut me down.

569
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:57,241
- What happened?
- Never mind what happened. Cut me down.

570
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:21,652
Here he comes.

571
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:54,731
Where's Will Marlow now?

572
00:48:54,897 --> 00:48:56,685
Matt Coulter's inside doing the honors.

573
00:48:56,849 --> 00:48:59,532
You gotta make Will believe
you're on his side, remember.

574
00:48:59,696 --> 00:49:01,190
Downright perjury.

575
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,953
In case...

576
00:49:03,121 --> 00:49:06,154
Don't ask me to bear witness
against myself.

577
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:11,716
A job like that takes a big-caliber man,
Mr. Marlow.

578
00:49:11,887 --> 00:49:13,131
Just call me Will.

579
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:14,920
Evening, Matt. Evening, Mr. Marlow.

580
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:17,738
- Evening, judge.
- Oh, just call him Will.

581
00:49:17,902 --> 00:49:20,519
I was telling Mr. Marlow about our idea.

582
00:49:20,685 --> 00:49:23,019
We got to have a go-getter for mayor.

583
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,609
Oh, indubitably.

584
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:27,879
In a city such as ours, we'll need lights...

585
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:29,702
...pavements...

586
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:32,806
...indoor water closets.

587
00:49:32,972 --> 00:49:35,939
Oh, good evening, marshal.
Pour yourself some spirits.

588
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:38,791
- Good evening, marshal.
- We've been feeling Mr. Marlow out...

589
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:41,736
- ... on running for mayor.
- Marshal won't think I'm a go-getter.

590
00:49:41,898 --> 00:49:44,680
I been working on that deed for you,
but Mrs. Walters here...

591
00:49:44,842 --> 00:49:47,012
Didn't she tell you?
I bought the deed from her.

592
00:49:47,176 --> 00:49:49,281
- Evening, Mrs. Walters.
- Good evening, marshal.

593
00:49:50,024 --> 00:49:53,090
I'm afraid Mr. Marlow won't be available
to run for mayor.

594
00:49:53,672 --> 00:49:56,705
- Why not?
- I aim to have him behind bars.

595
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:58,049
That's a mighty poor joke.

596
00:49:58,215 --> 00:50:00,997
I wouldn't advise making
irresponsible statements, marshal.

597
00:50:01,159 --> 00:50:03,974
He's in cahoots with his brother.
One's guilty, so is the other.

598
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:08,956
Somebody's lying. Anybody says I was
ever tied up with Bryant, I'll sue for libel.

599
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:11,100
Bryant just got through ambushing me.

600
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:14,116
It ain't possible.
He wouldn't dare to go against...

601
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:18,112
He had a. 44 halfway down my gullet.

602
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:20,731
- You drilled him.
- He shot the guns right off me.

603
00:50:20,899 --> 00:50:22,361
I had to talk my way out.

604
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:24,222
He let you...?

605
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:26,433
Praise heaven he saw the light.

606
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:30,556
No man wants his brother
to have a killing on his soul.

607
00:50:32,098 --> 00:50:34,040
Interesting thing is
how I talked my way out.

608
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:36,664
He didn't know I'd bought
the Chuckaway any more than you.

609
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,581
He thought if he killed me,
it'd cost you money.

610
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:43,060
Figured it better to let me walk out
than to have you on his neck.

611
00:50:43,615 --> 00:50:46,070
Mr. Marlow, this is hard to believe...

612
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:48,792
- ... that a citizen like you...
- It's Bryant, that renegade.

613
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,202
He's always been against me.

614
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:53,563
Hates my law-abiding principle.
He's trying to put the blight on me.

615
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:56,857
Will's right.
Bryant pulled one on you, marshal.

616
00:50:57,022 --> 00:50:59,062
Will's in the clear. Why, you were there.

617
00:50:59,229 --> 00:51:01,782
He promised to post a reward
for Bryant's capture.

618
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:04,120
I'd hate to hang by my toes till you do.

619
00:51:04,285 --> 00:51:07,698
Well, you know, a man hates
to put the dead mark on his brother.

620
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:09,776
You hear that?
He's making it dead or alive.

621
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:12,762
Now, any man that's big enough for that
is big enough for mayor.

622
00:51:12,923 --> 00:51:15,191
- Yeah!
- Yeah, he's right!

623
00:51:16,442 --> 00:51:17,619
You're right, Matt.

624
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,268
You're going to eat crow, marshal.

625
00:51:21,434 --> 00:51:24,750
I'm authorizing you
to announce my reward:

626
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:27,317
Two thousand dollars for Bryant Marlow.

627
00:51:29,977 --> 00:51:33,074
- Dead or alive.
- I guess I ought to be man enough...

628
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:35,573
...to say I'm wrong, Mr. Marlow.

629
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:37,426
Thank you, marshal.

630
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:39,827
Thank you, gentlemen, one and all.

631
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,681
Good night, Matt.

632
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:44,721
He's gonna make a good mayor.

633
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:48,785
I wish it was Saturday night
so I could take a bath.

634
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:26,530
Hey, Bryant.

635
00:53:26,693 --> 00:53:28,121
- What?
- Here's Reno.

636
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,528
Reno, boy.

637
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,794
- What's this?
- What?

638
00:53:34,084 --> 00:53:35,775
Two thousand dollars?

639
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,241
Oh, no. Will wouldn't do that.

640
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:41,370
Oh, no. "Brother Willy wouldn't do that. "

641
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:43,164
Thought it out pretty, didn't he?

642
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:45,664
Marshal will bust his buttons
trying to get you...

643
00:53:45,825 --> 00:53:48,192
...and you'll curl them,
and the town will posse up...

644
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:50,011
...and no matter which way
you turn...

645
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:52,827
...they'll be pouring led at you
until they get that reward.

646
00:53:52,993 --> 00:53:56,887
And brother Willy will be in the clear,
and have everything going his way.

647
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,155
Pete. Pete.

648
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,977
Marshal.

649
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:06,812
Bryant, marshal.

650
00:54:26,203 --> 00:54:28,145
He's down behind that little rock
by the cut.

651
00:54:28,315 --> 00:54:31,064
Get behind the brush and when I shoot,
let him have it.

652
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,328
Now, hold it.

653
00:55:10,451 --> 00:55:14,477
That marshal knows where the hideout is
now and he'll be coming back with a posse.

654
00:55:14,643 --> 00:55:16,879
You fellas stay covered up
inside them rocks...

655
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:19,563
...and you can pick them all off
as they come.

656
00:55:33,743 --> 00:55:37,158
Oh, Reb. Reb.

657
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:41,354
You've come back. You're safe.

658
00:55:47,374 --> 00:55:49,315
- Where's Martin?
- In town.

659
00:55:49,486 --> 00:55:52,137
He and Luis were out all night
with Father and the vaqueros.

660
00:55:52,301 --> 00:55:55,978
- They're still searching for you.
- They shouldn't have left you here alone.

661
00:55:57,165 --> 00:55:59,106
I'm going to Dallas.
I've got to find Martin.

662
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:00,650
He'll come back here.

663
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:02,753
I... I can't wait.

664
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:05,635
Tonight I'll finish up
my business in Texas.

665
00:56:05,803 --> 00:56:07,810
I won't be back, Tonia.

666
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:09,287
Won't be back?

667
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,002
I told you, I wouldn't be here long.

668
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,116
Yes, I remember.

669
00:56:14,282 --> 00:56:16,289
It's what you wanted.

670
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:18,184
That was three weeks ago.

671
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:20,455
Nothing's changed.

672
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:24,934
Everything's changed, Reb.

673
00:56:26,695 --> 00:56:28,353
I can't let you go.

674
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:31,650
You're engaged to Martin. He's the one
you're due to marry. What about him?

675
00:56:32,742 --> 00:56:35,011
- What about you?
- Forget about me.

676
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:36,384
I'm a wanted criminal.

677
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:38,045
Yes, I know that.

678
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,539
Martin told you? Why?

679
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:43,773
Was he afraid I'd forget?

680
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,853
You haven't answered my question.

681
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,035
What about you?

682
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,530
I've answered it. Forget me.

683
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:53,112
- You don't mean that.
- I do mean it.

684
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:54,690
I have to mean it.

685
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:57,306
A long time ago,
it might have been different.

686
00:56:57,474 --> 00:56:59,263
You wouldn't have been
engaged to Martin.

687
00:56:59,426 --> 00:57:03,997
I wouldn't have to be hiding behind his
shirttails. I'd have had a name, a home.

688
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,577
You have this home.

689
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:09,370
I told you that when you first came.

690
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:19,028
Martin, he's safe.

691
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:21,271
I heard in Dallas.

692
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:26,518
Congratulations, Reb.

693
00:57:26,845 --> 00:57:28,089
Did you see Will Marlow?

694
00:57:28,253 --> 00:57:29,398
And Trask.

695
00:57:29,564 --> 00:57:32,630
Every time he tries to ride out to Bryant,
Coulter corners him for a drink.

696
00:57:32,797 --> 00:57:37,717
- Popularity is beginning to go to his head.
- Matt Coulter? Friendly with the Marlows?

697
00:57:37,884 --> 00:57:39,793
It's a scheme of Reb's.

698
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,685
Where are you going?

699
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:46,067
He's going to Dallas.

700
00:57:46,234 --> 00:57:47,347
I'm going with him.

701
00:57:48,282 --> 00:57:51,478
You're staying here, where you belong.

702
00:57:58,744 --> 00:58:00,468
Didn't expect to find you here.

703
00:58:00,632 --> 00:58:02,836
Thought you'd be waiting in Dallas
for Bryant.

704
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,309
Bryant will think that too.

705
00:58:04,727 --> 00:58:07,596
Or else he'll expect me to organize
a posse to come after him.

706
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:11,824
By night, his nerves will get the best of him
and he'll come in to see what I am doing.

707
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,673
You stay here too.
I don't want you underfoot.

708
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:18,832
Reb, what are you going to do about her?

709
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:20,720
I came here gunning for Bryant.

710
00:58:20,885 --> 00:58:22,411
When that's done, I'll move on.

711
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,685
You don't have to move on.

712
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:28,113
I do have to, you know that.
You even told her.

713
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:30,696
You're willing enough to keep it quiet
everywhere else.

714
00:58:30,867 --> 00:58:32,394
What if you weren't a wanted man...

715
00:58:32,562 --> 00:58:34,570
...free to go or stay?
What would you do then?

716
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:37,612
I'd sink my roots in Dallas
and take her away from you.

717
00:58:37,777 --> 00:58:39,086
Any way I could.

718
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,544
Glad you said that. Makes it all right
for me to play that way too.

719
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:45,385
You'd be a fool if you didn't.

720
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,893
- Where's Reb?
- He's gone.

721
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:16,743
- He wants you to stay here with me.
- I heard him.

722
00:59:16,908 --> 00:59:19,012
But you still want to go with him?

723
00:59:19,339 --> 00:59:20,965
You wouldn't want me to pretend.

724
00:59:21,131 --> 00:59:24,742
No, I wouldn't want that,
but I don't want you to go either.

725
00:59:24,906 --> 00:59:28,582
- I must...
- Tonia, he has it the way he wants it.

726
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:30,469
What do you mean?

727
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:33,543
Remember what I said about
the brutality of hope?

728
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,111
There's to be no pardon.

729
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,606
He's still a wanted man.

730
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,901
Maybe I'm not as smart as I figured.

731
01:00:24,063 --> 01:00:26,551
Maybe Bryant's not coming in.

732
01:00:27,488 --> 01:00:29,527
Will's not gone to him.

733
01:00:29,951 --> 01:00:31,991
I've been thinking.

734
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,517
We ain't the kind to get
quite so popular...

735
01:00:34,686 --> 01:00:36,890
Any fool could see the marshal
had rigged me.

736
01:00:37,054 --> 01:00:39,704
Now the town's standing against
my getting word to Bryant.

737
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,811
Any moment
he'll come roaring in and...

738
01:00:50,365 --> 01:00:52,851
Haven't they got homes to go to?

739
01:00:56,794 --> 01:00:59,314
A month ago, there wouldn't have been
one of them there.

740
01:00:59,482 --> 01:01:01,903
Now you ain't asked them...

741
01:01:02,074 --> 01:01:03,568
...and they're all here...

742
01:01:03,738 --> 01:01:06,672
...expecting that maybe you'll want to send
a posse after Bryant.

743
01:01:07,577 --> 01:01:10,294
If they rode out there,
half of them would never ride back.

744
01:01:10,457 --> 01:01:11,701
They know that.

745
01:01:11,865 --> 01:01:13,457
They're still willing.

746
01:01:30,582 --> 01:01:32,916
You gave us more than
a town hall, marshal.

747
01:01:33,077 --> 01:01:35,019
You gave us the grit
to get our town back.

748
01:01:35,188 --> 01:01:37,522
We're willing to fight for it again.

749
01:01:37,684 --> 01:01:39,408
Worth fighting for.

750
01:01:55,697 --> 01:01:58,446
There's a lot of the history of Dallas
standing over there.

751
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:00,267
One fella settled at Trinity Forks...

752
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:03,913
...when old Johnny Brian
was still chinking at his log house.

753
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,829
New settlers from the East and South.

754
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:09,708
They're all just Dallas now.

755
01:02:09,999 --> 01:02:13,064
I guess that old Scotsman knew what
he was writing about when he said:

756
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,618
"Breathes there a man
with soul so dead... "

757
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,219
I know the rest.

758
01:02:17,389 --> 01:02:18,883
Glad you do, marshal.

759
01:02:19,053 --> 01:02:23,209
We'd be pleased if you'd
make this your native land too.

760
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:26,187
You're not talking about me.
You're talking about a tin badge...

761
01:02:26,349 --> 01:02:28,007
...and the Weatherby checkbook.

762
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:31,336
Besides, I'm sitting on a short fuse.

763
01:03:31,425 --> 01:03:33,595
Hear you all got cotton dirt
around here.

764
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,378
Pick your half-section, settler. Come far?

765
01:03:36,544 --> 01:03:38,813
Through corn lands and cow lands...

766
01:03:38,976 --> 01:03:42,292
...and land oozing filthy grease
that dang-near ruined my wagon.

767
01:03:45,056 --> 01:03:47,444
Keep that wagon out of there.

768
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,549
Great Caesar's ghost.

769
01:03:51,742 --> 01:03:55,255
Betty, drive these down a bit. I...

770
01:04:03,804 --> 01:04:07,033
I don't wanna roust you around,
but this smells like gunfighting weather.

771
01:04:07,195 --> 01:04:11,024
Roust all you like, colonel,
and if you want a good gun hand again...

772
01:04:11,195 --> 01:04:12,405
What are you talking about?

773
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:14,294
Don't you remember me, sir?

774
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,052
Hillis from Macon.

775
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:18,258
I rode with your Georgia regiment.

776
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:21,489
Sergeant in Troop C.

777
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,893
I never been in Georgia.

778
01:04:31,415 --> 01:04:35,474
If that ain't Colonel Reb, this ain't Texas.

779
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:37,621
What did you say?

780
01:04:38,135 --> 01:04:40,273
I could swear that's my old colonel...

781
01:04:40,438 --> 01:04:43,056
The name, man, the name.
You said Reb?

782
01:04:43,222 --> 01:04:44,465
I sure did.

783
01:04:44,629 --> 01:04:46,091
Colonel Hollister, sir.

784
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:48,879
Fifth Georgia Cavalry.

785
01:04:57,779 --> 01:04:59,601
That settler seemed to know you.

786
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:00,875
Don't go probing, judge.

787
01:05:01,043 --> 01:05:03,498
That short fuse is about to
blow me out of town.

788
01:05:28,015 --> 01:05:29,476
How did Will Marlow get away?

789
01:05:29,646 --> 01:05:31,620
Will? He's in his office.

790
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:35,783
He just passed me riding south
like the hounds of Hades was on his tail.

791
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:39,332
South? Then he's not going to Bryant.

792
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:45,513
You see a man
come out of that building?

793
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,936
I don't know where he come from,
but he lit out like he was turpentine...

794
01:05:49,098 --> 01:05:50,789
...when I said you was Colonel Hollister.

795
01:05:51,307 --> 01:05:53,575
You and your big mouth.
You were the turpentine.

796
01:05:53,737 --> 01:05:57,032
- I didn't mean...
- Anyway, you've done one thing:

797
01:05:57,449 --> 01:06:00,296
You've proved they were all in it
in Georgia.

798
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:03,490
Dogs that ain't kill sheep, don't run.

799
01:06:05,097 --> 01:06:08,195
We're gonna catch Will
before he sets a long trail.

800
01:06:09,831 --> 01:06:12,765
- I'll be back for Bryant.
- Good luck, Reb.

801
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:24,926
You fellas stay out of this.
Get inside.

802
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:45,210
You ain't gonna talk your way out of it
this time, marshal.

803
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:47,035
You won't either, Bryant.

804
01:07:43,128 --> 01:07:45,102
You can't fool me.

805
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:49,619
There ain't only one man in the whole world
can shoot like that.

806
01:07:49,783 --> 01:07:51,986
Reb Hollister.

807
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,939
Hollister...

808
01:07:55,415 --> 01:07:58,447
...get my brother, Will.

809
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:02,223
He set the fire in Georgia.

810
01:08:10,803 --> 01:08:12,658
Drag out the sour mash.

811
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:14,826
We're drinking to old Reb.

812
01:08:14,995 --> 01:08:17,002
Good idea!

813
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:37,445
- Warrant?
- Yes, it was his warrant.

814
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:42,692
Reb Hollister. This is impossible.

815
01:08:42,863 --> 01:08:45,034
How could he
have come here as...?

816
01:08:46,382 --> 01:08:47,811
Did you know this?

817
01:08:47,981 --> 01:08:52,104
Sure I knew.
That's why I put my chips on Dallas.

818
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:09,079
But, judge,
how can you be so vindictive?

819
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:12,247
Yesterday he was your hero,
and today he's an outlaw.

820
01:10:12,415 --> 01:10:16,124
And he's still the same man,
a man who's helped all of us.

821
01:10:16,286 --> 01:10:18,195
It's not a matter of being vindictive.

822
01:10:18,366 --> 01:10:19,740
It's a matter of the law.

823
01:10:19,902 --> 01:10:21,877
Only facts have any bearing.

824
01:10:22,046 --> 01:10:23,093
Facts?

825
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,563
What if they burned your family home
to the ground...

826
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:28,114
...so what they done
wouldn't show in the ashes?

827
01:10:28,285 --> 01:10:31,601
Reb's father and sister are still missing.

828
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:34,044
Would you think
the war was over, judge...

829
01:10:34,205 --> 01:10:37,651
...just because some fellas
signed some papers over in Virginia?

830
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:41,364
I wouldn't.
Not while the guilty ones was still alive.

831
01:10:41,531 --> 01:10:45,175
Reb thought Bryant done it alone,
but he learned different.

832
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:48,371
The one who put the torch
to the Hollisters' was Will.

833
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:51,472
But he had no right to take the law
into his own hands.

834
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:54,510
Rights? He's been drawn and quartered
by legal rights.

835
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,109
We've all been.

836
01:10:56,281 --> 01:11:00,558
I respect the man as much as any of you,
but I respect the law more.

837
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:03,472
Weatherby, you've perpetrated a fraud...

838
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:05,875
...in allowing this criminal
to assume your place.

839
01:11:06,038 --> 01:11:08,045
It must be reported
to the Attorney General.

840
01:11:08,214 --> 01:11:10,036
- Reb's no criminal.
- No criminal?

841
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:12,302
Here's direct evidence.

842
01:11:12,598 --> 01:11:14,769
This is of later origin.

843
01:11:15,285 --> 01:11:17,226
It came yesterday.

844
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:21,486
Pardon?

845
01:11:21,684 --> 01:11:22,993
On what grounds?

846
01:11:23,156 --> 01:11:24,880
Service as a United States Marshal.

847
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:27,891
Have you forgotten he killed Cullen,
stopped the cattle raids...

848
01:11:28,052 --> 01:11:29,163
...and now killed Bryant?

849
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:36,942
You had this and didn't tell him?

850
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:39,723
I hoped that Bryant would win the fight.

851
01:11:43,184 --> 01:11:45,453
You can blame me that he's gone again...

852
01:11:45,616 --> 01:11:47,787
...thinking himself a criminal.

853
01:12:19,691 --> 01:12:21,959
Sure appreciate
your interest in this, Mr...

854
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:24,804
- Mr...
- Abernathy.

855
01:12:24,969 --> 01:12:28,580
Be a feather in my cap picking up
a desperado like Reb Hollister.

856
01:12:32,552 --> 01:12:34,178
Here he comes.

857
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:36,995
- That's him.
- Sure?

858
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,265
Don't start arguing.

859
01:12:49,285 --> 01:12:50,562
Go on, sheriff, jail him.

860
01:12:50,725 --> 01:12:53,441
Keep him there until they get
a rope around his neck.

861
01:13:00,388 --> 01:13:02,176
Hello, high pockets.
How's the...?

862
01:13:04,355 --> 01:13:06,362
Been a long time since
we picked up anybody...

863
01:13:06,531 --> 01:13:08,865
...who packed a shooting iron
in their boot.

864
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:12,442
Better put them on. Them floors get cold.

865
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:15,642
Never mind my health. Look up
that fella that gave you the word.

866
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:19,551
His name's not Abernathy. It's Will Marlow.
He'll be heading back for Dallas.

867
01:13:19,808 --> 01:13:22,841
Take it easy, fella. Judge Tomkins
will see you Monday morning.

868
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:24,317
Tell your tale of woe to him.

869
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,072
- Monday morning?
- Monday morning.

870
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,824
Well, that's four... I can't...

871
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:34,522
Make yourself comfortable, boy.

872
01:13:34,686 --> 01:13:37,501
You ain't gonna do nothing
on that chair nohow.

873
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,212
Miguel.

874
01:13:45,244 --> 01:13:46,967
Miguel.

875
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:21,712
Wait. You stay here.

876
01:14:24,054 --> 01:14:25,396
Who are you?

877
01:14:25,558 --> 01:14:28,045
They're my boys, Felipe.

878
01:14:30,453 --> 01:14:32,013
Luis.

879
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,511
Take the men
and get back to your spots.

880
01:14:40,371 --> 01:14:42,705
Close the doors and the shutters.

881
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,010
- Vultures.
- Get your cutthroats out.

882
01:14:48,178 --> 01:14:50,861
Yelp all you like.
I've been cursed by deadbeats before.

883
01:14:51,026 --> 01:14:53,960
You've got no right living like grandees
with my note coming due.

884
01:14:54,129 --> 01:14:57,511
- Note's not due yet.
- It is if I say so.

885
01:14:57,681 --> 01:14:59,207
I'm closing my accounts here.

886
01:14:59,377 --> 01:15:01,710
I'm taking my rightful money
with me now.

887
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:03,529
You've stolen our cattle.

888
01:15:03,695 --> 01:15:05,550
We haven't enough left
to raise the money.

889
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:06,987
Get it.

890
01:15:07,151 --> 01:15:08,809
Tonight? Where?

891
01:15:08,975 --> 01:15:10,120
Weatherby.

892
01:15:10,287 --> 01:15:11,748
He'll give you the 25,000.

893
01:15:13,006 --> 01:15:15,395
- You get nothing!
- Would you...?

894
01:15:15,565 --> 01:15:18,053
But you don't tell Weatherby
why you want it.

895
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:21,003
You do and you'll get your pups
back in gunnysacks.

896
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:22,342
But what can I say?

897
01:15:22,509 --> 01:15:26,567
You didn't find any trouble thinking up
reasons when you wanted to borrow money.

898
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:30,343
If I were you, I'd be in a hurry.

899
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:47,042
I'll pay you.

900
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,664
But if you harm them, you'll pay me.

901
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:52,030
- Remember that.
- You remember it.

902
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:58,497
Tell the whole town about what...

903
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:51,962
You fool! Are you crazy?

904
01:16:52,126 --> 01:16:53,336
Quiet!

905
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:04,722
Help! Help!

906
01:17:04,892 --> 01:17:07,641
Help! Help!

907
01:17:12,059 --> 01:17:14,098
Help!

908
01:17:23,353 --> 01:17:25,360
Hey, open this door. Open this door.

909
01:17:25,528 --> 01:17:28,462
Fire breaks out.
We'll get you out of the building.

910
01:17:29,847 --> 01:17:31,341
Halt.

911
01:17:50,483 --> 01:17:53,200
On your horses! Hurry up!

912
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:58,542
All right, men.

913
01:18:38,092 --> 01:18:42,248
Burt, Curly, pick up that wagon.
Rest of you boys follow me.

914
01:19:03,016 --> 01:19:06,944
But, Mr. Robles, there isn't
$25,000 cash in the whole town.

915
01:19:07,111 --> 01:19:09,086
- There must be.
- But why do you want it?

916
01:19:09,255 --> 01:19:12,418
Don't ask me. Don't ask me anything.

917
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:14,753
And say nothing to those you talk to.

918
01:19:14,918 --> 01:19:18,463
It means more than my life, Martin.

919
01:19:19,973 --> 01:19:21,599
You wait here.

920
01:19:43,778 --> 01:19:45,468
- Got it?
- From merchants, the banker...

921
01:19:45,633 --> 01:19:47,258
...even Mrs. Walters. It's all here.

922
01:19:47,425 --> 01:19:49,018
- You told them nothing?
- No, nothing.

923
01:19:50,624 --> 01:19:53,079
- You've got to tell me what it's for.
- I can't tell you.

924
01:19:53,248 --> 01:19:55,189
- Then I'll go with you.
- No, no, you mustn't.

925
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:57,530
Does Will Marlow
have anything to do with this?

926
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:01,308
- Has he returned to Dallas?
- No.

927
01:20:01,471 --> 01:20:04,318
Don Felipe, is Tonia all right?

928
01:20:04,478 --> 01:20:06,550
I hope so, my boy.

929
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:12,466
"Hope so"?

930
01:20:18,844 --> 01:20:20,022
Oh, Mr. Robles.

931
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:25,780
Keep your eyes peeled for old Robles.

932
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,077
If he's not alone,
tell the men to start shooting.

933
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:45,078
- Where's Will Marlow?
- Thought you were following him.

934
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:47,660
He outfoxed me.
Got me jugged over in Fort Worth.

935
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:49,619
Means he'll double back here.

936
01:20:49,782 --> 01:20:51,091
He has doubled back.

937
01:20:51,254 --> 01:20:52,970
That's why Felipe
wanted the money.

938
01:20:53,042 --> 01:20:54,090
What money?

939
01:20:54,262 --> 01:20:56,433
Well, he was here.
He made me get him $25,000.

940
01:20:56,597 --> 01:20:58,353
He wouldn't say why.

941
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:01,516
- But he said it wasn't Marlow.
- What have you got under that hat?

942
01:21:01,685 --> 01:21:04,587
Why would anybody keep silent?
Because he's got a gun in his back.

943
01:21:04,756 --> 01:21:08,301
- Yes, but Marlow wasn't... No.
- Marlow wasn't with Felipe?

944
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:12,455
Must mean he's got Tonia and Luis,
holding them as hostages.

945
01:21:15,506 --> 01:21:17,872
- New gun, huh?
- Yeah.

946
01:21:23,313 --> 01:21:24,775
I'll go get a posse together.

947
01:21:24,944 --> 01:21:28,173
You stay put.
I got a ready-made one coming.

948
01:21:29,744 --> 01:21:32,678
- How long ago Felipe leave here?
- Too long. You can't overtake him.

949
01:21:32,848 --> 01:21:34,604
I can try.

950
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:37,100
Bring them along.

951
01:21:46,381 --> 01:21:48,388
Well, your pa will be back
in a minute or two.

952
01:21:48,557 --> 01:21:49,833
Be a comfort to you.

953
01:21:49,996 --> 01:21:52,713
Three of you, tied up together.

954
01:21:52,876 --> 01:21:56,421
You're making a noose for your neck.
This house will tell its secrets.

955
01:21:56,588 --> 01:22:00,744
Ashes don't tell secrets.
Hollister learned that in Georgia.

956
01:22:08,553 --> 01:22:10,887
Robles is coming!

957
01:22:13,577 --> 01:22:14,984
Robles is coming.

958
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:18,657
Robles is coming.

959
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:25,949
He's alone.

960
01:22:27,847 --> 01:22:30,050
- It's all right. He's alone.
- Bring him inside.

961
01:22:39,012 --> 01:22:41,019
It's Hollister!

962
01:23:05,216 --> 01:23:07,997
Here comes Weatherby and a posse!

963
01:23:19,774 --> 01:23:21,945
Open up, Will.

964
01:24:39,185 --> 01:24:42,567
Use up your powder, Will,
then I'll kill you.

965
01:24:47,503 --> 01:24:49,958
What will you do when
your bullets are gone, Marlow?

966
01:24:51,343 --> 01:24:53,579
You got one left.

967
01:25:26,537 --> 01:25:28,806
Didn't figure you for two guns.

968
01:25:28,969 --> 01:25:31,238
That leaves five.

969
01:25:35,336 --> 01:25:37,191
Fool, wasn't I, Will?

970
01:25:37,352 --> 01:25:39,489
I should've killed you weeks ago.

971
01:25:39,654 --> 01:25:41,694
But you were smart.

972
01:25:42,214 --> 01:25:44,319
You covered your Georgia trail.

973
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:49,539
All I had was Bryant's scent.

974
01:25:58,308 --> 01:26:00,380
That's three left, Will.

975
01:26:00,548 --> 01:26:02,370
And then I'll kill you.

976
01:26:02,851 --> 01:26:04,760
Barehand.

977
01:26:08,482 --> 01:26:11,296
Like I dreamed of killing Bry...

978
01:26:14,465 --> 01:26:17,596
And all the time it was you
that lit the flame.

979
01:26:38,044 --> 01:26:40,946
Keep away from the window, Will.
You make too good a target.

980
01:27:02,073 --> 01:27:05,422
Did you really think the ashes
would cover for you, Will?

981
01:27:07,864 --> 01:27:09,718
That's your last bullet.

982
01:27:22,295 --> 01:27:24,661
Where's Tonia and Luis?

983
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:27,952
I didn't hurt them.
They're upstairs. I didn't hurt...

984
01:27:40,786 --> 01:27:42,761
Get up on your feet.

985
01:27:47,986 --> 01:27:49,960
Let me go. You won't regret it.

986
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:51,952
I'll leave Dallas. I'll never come back.

987
01:27:52,113 --> 01:27:53,934
Oh, no.

988
01:27:54,096 --> 01:27:56,300
Oh, no, Will. Never.

989
01:27:56,464 --> 01:27:59,365
You like to see them burn, remember?

990
01:27:59,535 --> 01:28:01,542
Now it's your turn.

991
01:28:02,223 --> 01:28:03,750
Your neck, Will.

992
01:28:03,919 --> 01:28:06,439
Rope burn,
with the whole town looking on.

993
01:28:07,214 --> 01:28:11,207
Burn legal, Will.
The way you like it.

994
01:28:17,517 --> 01:28:19,752
Here's a couple more for you, sheriff.

995
01:28:26,955 --> 01:28:29,573
Why, Mr. Abernathy,
you've got him again.

996
01:28:31,435 --> 01:28:34,151
You'll like him, sheriff. Here.

997
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:42,343
- Antonia, Luis. Where are they?
- Upstairs.

998
01:28:42,505 --> 01:28:45,123
Will Marlow. He's the wanted one.

999
01:28:45,703 --> 01:28:48,124
Antonia. Luis.

1000
01:28:49,959 --> 01:28:51,901
Antonia.

1001
01:28:52,871 --> 01:28:54,627
Tonia.

1002
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:56,198
Reb.

1003
01:28:57,574 --> 01:28:59,232
Oh, Reb.

1004
01:28:59,398 --> 01:29:01,186
Oh, Reb.

1005
01:29:03,653 --> 01:29:05,311
Well...

1006
01:29:05,477 --> 01:29:07,778
- ... you won my bet for me.
- What?

1007
01:29:07,941 --> 01:29:11,235
Tin-badge bet, remember?
You couldn't finish Marlow off, could you?

1008
01:29:11,396 --> 01:29:13,370
You had your chance,
but you couldn't do it.

1009
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:16,800
That oath you took as marshal
crowded you too much.

1010
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:21,373
Here. Free man.

1011
01:29:21,538 --> 01:29:25,182
Sink your roots in Dallas.
Grow your cotton.

1012
01:29:25,346 --> 01:29:26,720
Raise your kids.

1013
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:28,408
Martin...

1014
01:29:29,217 --> 01:29:31,191
- I hope...
- You don't have to say it.

1015
01:29:31,361 --> 01:29:33,248
I know what your hopes are.

1016
01:29:33,408 --> 01:29:35,001
Where are you going?

1017
01:29:35,168 --> 01:29:38,168
Well, somebody's got
to tote that cotton.

1018
01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:40,474
I got me a railroad to build.

1019
01:29:45,502 --> 01:29:48,535
That Yankee foreigner's
talking American.

1020
01:29:51,741 --> 01:29:53,334
So are you.
