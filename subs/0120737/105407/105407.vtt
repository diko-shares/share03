1
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:20,982
There's 2 kinds of people
in this world when you boil it all down.

2
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:24,527
You've got your talkers
and you've got your doers.

3
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:28,463
Most people are just talkers.
All they got is talk.

4
00:00:29,534 --> 00:00:33,994
But when all is said and done,
it's the doers who change this world.

5
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:37,403
And when they do that,
they change us.

6
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,636
And that's why
we never forget them.

7
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,936
So, which one are you?

8
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:43,639
Do you just talk about it

9
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:46,342
or do you stand up
and do something about it?

10
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:52,320
Because believe you me, all the rest
of it is just coffeehouse bullshit.

11
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:43,436
Peace, they say,
is the enemy of memory.

12
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:46,909
So it had been for my boys.

13
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:54,213
For some time now, the past
had felt like a dream to them,

14
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:57,012
faded and worn.

15
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:02,687
And then suddenly,
as if not a day had passed,

16
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,421
it was back.

17
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:11,763
I could see it
in their eyes.

18
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:15,795
I could feel it,
heavy in their presence.

19
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:21,943
Something calling them back.

20
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,327
Something's happened.

21
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:07,683
No! Stop! Stop, stop!

22
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,986
Please, stop! Oh, God!
Please! Please!

23
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:15,292
God, no, stop...

24
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:27,105
A priest?

25
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:32,005
Did they
release his name?

26
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:37,218
No, but I made a few calls.
I still have friends in the diocese there.

27
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:42,781
McKinney.
Father Douglas McKinney.

28
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,351
You knew him?

29
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:48,828
Knew of him.
Everybody did.

30
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,328
He's a good man.
Youth hostels, soup kitchens.

31
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:55,165
He even made it to the papers
sometimes.

32
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:58,035
Look, boys, I think it's best
if you just stay put

33
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:01,905
until we try to figure out
what the hell is going on.

34
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,981
Aren't you at least gonna try
and talk them out of this?

35
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:11,575
For all we know, it could be somebody
just trying to get away with murder here.

36
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,812
Aye.

37
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:17,217
Only there's a thousand
easier ways to do that.

38
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,423
Trust me.

39
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:22,720
Someone's trying
to call them out.

40
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:28,997
You kill a priest, in a church,
and make it look like it was them.

41
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:32,699
Bring them back
with a vengeance.

42
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,600
Someone thinks
it's really clever.

43
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:39,612
Only one problem
with this little plan.

44
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,045
What's that?

45
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,514
It worked.

46
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:03,502
# Well, it was said
on the day of my birth

47
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:06,802
# A ghost of a dead man
walked the earth

48
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,847
# And my mama
don't love me none

49
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,941
# She hates everything
my daddy done

50
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,017
# You're so young,
my bastard son

51
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,857
# You're wanted
by the motherfucking law

52
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,563
# You're so young,
my bastard son

53
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,195
# You're wanted
by the motherfucking law

54
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,480
Exactly
what do you intend to do?

55
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:03,522
Every last motherfucker
that had anything to do with it.

56
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,205
There is no new information
on the victim found slain

57
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,975
this morning inside
the Church of the Holy Saints.

58
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,982
As you can see, the size of the crowd
here has increased substantially

59
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:31,546
as we have confirmed that the body
was ritualized with pennies in the eyes.

60
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,125
Many remember this
as the grisly calling card

61
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,390
of the prolific vigilante killers
known as the Saints,

62
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,896
who went on a murder spree
here in Boston.

63
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,864
A rampage that ended
8 years ago

64
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,459
when the Saints brazenly
walked into open court

65
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,300
and executed Mafia don
Poppa Joe Yakavetta

66
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,307
before a courtroom
of terrified witnesses

67
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,208
and then simply disappeared
without a trace.

68
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,212
As police have yet to confirm
the Saints' possible involvement,

69
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,045
the ominous question
hangs heavy in the air.

70
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,209
"Are they back?"

71
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,049
We need to keep our heads here.

72
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,889
It's probably not even them.

73
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,430
Course it ain't them.
It doesn't really matter, does it?

74
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,034
All our skeletons just came
screaming out of the closet.

75
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,102
We're fucked!

76
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,068
We're not fucked!

77
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:23,073
We are totally fucked!
And not just fucked.

78
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,269
Like elephant-dick-pounded-in-the-ass,
no-reach-around,

79
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,470
jungle-fucked!

80
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,138
Now's not the time
to panic, green beans!

81
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,738
I disagree!

82
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,410
Now is a perfect time to panic.
We are all accessories...

83
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,214
Don't fucking say it!
I'm gonna say it, all right.

84
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,618
You've got a mouth on you,
Greenly.

85
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,122
Both of you calm down.
Just calm down.

86
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,918
Shut the fuck up!

87
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,727
Her ETA's 10 minutes.

88
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,888
Thanks, Seamus.

89
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,400
It's game time.
How we playing this?

90
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,976
Feds love to pull the
divide-and-conquer routine.

91
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,446
We hardline her.
Stick together on this.

92
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,743
Agreed?

93
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,048
Agreed.
We're a brick wall.

94
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,390
Let's rock this bitch.

95
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,391
# Comin' back, baby,
how about you?

96
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,087
# I'm the real thang

97
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,163
# Real thang

98
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,822
# This ain't no pony show

99
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,899
# Ain't a pony show

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,729
# I came to rock the mike

101
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,802
# He's going
to rock the mike

102
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,392
# Come on back, baby,
let me know

103
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:26,471
# Let him know

104
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,937
# 'Cause I'm the real thang

105
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,975
# Ain't no question about it

106
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,910
# And I'm gonna stand up
and shout it

107
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,074
# From every stage I sing

108
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,352
Eunice Bloom.
It's a pleasure.

109
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,256
Now, you have got
to be Greenly.

110
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,261
Smecker always said
you were the funny one.

111
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,922
Well, funny as in
"ha-ha," though,

112
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:56,693
not like funny as in "gay,"
'cause I'm totally not.

113
00:08:56,834 --> 00:09:00,497
What we're trying to figure out is,
with all due respect, Agent Bloom...

114
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:02,367
"Special."

115
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:03,701
Excuse me?

116
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:06,833
You see, there's a "special"
before my "agent."

117
00:09:06,944 --> 00:09:08,434
If we're gonna address
each other formally,

118
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,013
I'd appreciate
if you popped it in there,

119
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:11,775
because it
makes me feel special.

120
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:13,645
Of course, I was hoping we could
be a bit more personable.

121
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:16,652
In fact, I'd welcome you to call
me Eunice, and maybe I...

122
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:18,517
Okay, Eunice.

123
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,449
I don't see why the fuck
the Fed is even involved.

124
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,390
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

125
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:27,021
"Fuck"? This isn't a
"fuck" situation, is it?

126
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:29,894
I mean, I can understand a "goddamn"
or 2, but why skip all the way...

127
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:33,629
What is the Fed's
interest in this?

128
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:39,870
Their interest, Detective,
is capturing the men responsible

129
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,241
for the murders of 22 of Boston's
finest criminals.

130
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,679
They could have sent anyone. They sent me.
Now, why do you think that is?

131
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:50,652
Well, since we've already broken the
"fuck" barrier, allow me to be blunt.

132
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:53,018
It is because
I am so fucking smart

133
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:56,581
that I make smart people feel
that they are retarded.

134
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:20,283
Motherfuckers!
Which one do you want?

135
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,715
Me first, man,
me first!

136
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:25,747
Bust his head!

137
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:27,718
That son of a bitch over there!

138
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:36,098
All right!
House is closed, motherfuckers!

139
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:40,961
Why are his hands chained?

140
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:43,405
Romeo is very fast, man.

141
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:46,542
He says the Frenchman
can't lay a hand on him.

142
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:48,600
But he can't hit him back.

143
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,904
That's the bet, ese.

144
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,741
He's got to last 5 minutes.

145
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:05,056
50 on the Mexican.

146
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,388
Never fight
a Mexican, Pierre.

147
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:12,764
Pound for pound, toughest
motherfuckers on Earth!

148
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:17,165
Attaboy!

149
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,969
You know why?
We like pain, Pierre.

150
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:22,236
Come on, come on!

151
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:25,178
Think about it, man.
Tabasco sauce?

152
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:29,081
What kind of fucked-up people
would even invent that shit?

153
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:33,284
Get the fuckout of the way!

154
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:41,685
Whore.

155
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,357
Don't be scared, now.
Remember, I can't hit you.

156
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,263
I ain't gonna hit you!

157
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:52,635
Found a loophole, bitch!
I ought to be a lawyer.

158
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,722
Thank you!

159
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:14,192
Shit, man!

160
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:37,181
Please, stop!
Oh, God! Please!

161
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:44,021
Please! Oh, God.
Oh, God! Oh, God!

162
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:57,598
It wasn't them, but I'm sure
you boys already knew that.

163
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,668
All their vics were criminals.
Clearly not the case here.

164
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:04,268
So, it wasn't them,
which makes this a local matter

165
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,006
and falls under
our jurisdiction.

166
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:10,346
So, with all due respect, we'll see
you later, Special Agent Bloom.

167
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:16,348
"With all due respect."
Man, I hate it when people say that,

168
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,859
because it is inevitably followed by
a disrespectful remark.

169
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,225
Here, let me
give you an example.

170
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,424
With all due respect, Detective,

171
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:30,095
this matter falls under
whatever jurisdiction

172
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:32,799
I fucking say it does.

173
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:35,831
You fucking...

174
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:37,137
Let's just...

175
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,911
What can you tell us
about the shooters?

176
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:43,643
"Shooter." Singular.

177
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,883
And I can tell you...

178
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:50,889
How shall I put this delicately?
He's a short little fucker.

179
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:57,088
One guy.
Dwarf. Got it.

180
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,897
Let me show you
what I'm talking about.

181
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,433
Detective Greenly,

182
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:08,574
you're the victim.

183
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:11,668
David.
You can call me David.

184
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,110
Very well, David.

185
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:19,180
The Saints' signature stance,
Copley Plaza Hotel 8 years ago.

186
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,680
2 men of identical height
put Yuri Petrova on his knees

187
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:25,917
and each dropped iron
to the back of his head.

188
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,030
Power hath descended
forth from Thy hand.

189
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,293
Eyes front, David.

190
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:38,838
The position of the victim and the
angles produced by the killers' stance

191
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:40,838
created a unique scenario.

192
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:43,705
The bullets crisscrossed in the skull
and exited the eyes.

193
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:48,008
Here, this did not occur. The rounds
moved on a straight trajectory

194
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:51,380
through the back of the
victim's head and out the front,

195
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,612
which happens when...

196
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:57,156
One guy's holding 2 guns to
the back of your head.

197
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:00,317
One guy.

198
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,469
But you said
he was wicked short.

199
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:19,908
The Saints were later determined
to be 5'11" tall.

200
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,843
The rounds exit
Petrova's eyeballs.

201
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:27,210
Here, they came out
the lower cheek,

202
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,583
3, 4 inches below the eyes.

203
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:34,818
That puts him at 5'7"-ish.
That's not uncommonly short.

204
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:38,394
The killer posed as a late-night
confessor.

205
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,225
Once the victim
entered the booth,

206
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:43,199
the killer had him isolated.
No escape.

207
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,131
Short stuff comes out
of the confessional,

208
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,205
kicks in the door of
the priest's chambers,

209
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:49,740
leaving a crescent-shaped
indentation,

210
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,606
which tells us that this cowboy was
wearing a boot with a pronounced heel.

211
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,610
Gave him a couple inches.

212
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,510
We're looking about 5'5",
gentlemen.

213
00:15:58,283 --> 00:15:59,944
That's wicked short.

214
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:01,212
Wicked.

215
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,085
Speculation on the Saints'
possible involvement

216
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:06,953
in the murder of Father Douglas McKinney
continues to boil over.

217
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,686
In fact, it has split the public
right down the middle.

218
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:12,122
My cousin was there.
He saw the body.

219
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,562
His hands were
crossed over his chest.

220
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:14,723
It was them.

221
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,822
It wasn't them.

222
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,834
You know, maybe the priest
did something.

223
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,734
There were pennies
in his eyes, they did it.

224
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:22,734
They didn't do it.
It wasn't them.

225
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:31,641
You're on the air, caller.

226
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,774
Well, finally,
man, yeah.

227
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,911
This guy was indicted last year
for ordering the murders of 22 people.

228
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,387
And it slid right off his back.
Piece of shit!

229
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,722
Indeed, Boston has been under the
terrible reign of this thug for years now.

230
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:44,227
Where's
the DA's office?

231
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:48,060
Why can't they make anything
stick to Concezio Yakavetta?

232
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:55,598
I can't believe that none of us
were consulted on this!

233
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:57,732
The disrespect!

234
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:02,811
We never would have okayed
such a thing. A priest! It's infamit?

235
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:07,146
Are we not Catholics?
For Christ's fucking sakes!

236
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:12,189
And for what? Revenge?
There's no business in it, Concezio.

237
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,916
The cops.
They can be all over us.

238
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:16,961
Forget the cops.
What about these Saints fuckers?

239
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:18,859
These guys were long gone,

240
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,522
and now you're trying to bring
the devil right back to our doorstep?

241
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,692
8 years ago,

242
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:29,534
these vigilante fucks
put my father on his knees

243
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,372
and executed him

244
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:37,112
in public.

245
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:47,791
Mi padrino, a blood relative
and benedictator to all of you.

246
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:56,701
You think that I don't know
that each one of you

247
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:02,037
has been waking up with the
night sweats over this for 8 years?

248
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:08,144
These sons of bitches
prison-fucked us!

249
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:10,741
In the ass!

250
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,475
And then they wiped their dicks
on our grandma's drapes!

251
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:22,057
And we have been living
in silent fear ever since.

252
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:25,995
We don't talk about it.

253
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,891
Rape victims seldom do.

254
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:37,429
Concezio is right.
Pretending you don't got a problem

255
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,536
don't solve nothing.

256
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:44,775
Let's take a moment

257
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:49,077
and look at
the serendiculous...

258
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:51,881
Seren...

259
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:53,512
Serendipitous.

260
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,788
...type situation
we find ourselves in.

261
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:05,191
There's a wicked good chance
that these Saints are gonna show.

262
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:10,799
And this time, they don't catch us
with our pants down.

263
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:18,604
This time, we deal with them
proactiviously, huh?

264
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:22,607
And don't forget
Boston's finest.

265
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,887
With their second bite
at the apple

266
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:29,789
they've got every reason in
the world to crank up the heat.

267
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,586
And as for
the Saints' doting fans,

268
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,786
fuck them!

269
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,834
Bad luck.

270
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:51,945
How would he even
recognize us?

271
00:19:52,047 --> 00:19:54,140
You don't remember the fucking
sketches on the news channel?

272
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,012
Shit, that's right.
Fuck's sake.

273
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,743
You know, every time you see
those composites on TV

274
00:19:57,853 --> 00:20:00,947
and they catch the guy,
it looks nothing like him.

275
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:02,483
But ours...

276
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:03,819
Just our luck, right?

277
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:07,784
We draw Leonardo fucking
da Vinci as a sketch artist.

278
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,998
And 2 days ago, we looked like
Jesus Christ.

279
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:12,828
What the fuck
we cut our hair for?

280
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:14,425
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:19,372
I don't know, it seemed like the thing
to do at the time, though, didn't it?

282
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:21,339
Maybe we should dye it.

283
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:23,002
What?

284
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:24,675
Well, they're always dying
their hair in the movies,

285
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,645
like The Fugitive.

286
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,716
It's covert and shit.

287
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:31,781
What color
would you dye it?

288
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,117
Lighter, I guess.

289
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:39,558
Do you mean blonde?

290
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,185
I didn't fucking say that.

291
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,161
Like California surfer boy.

292
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:44,254
It's not what I'm saying.

293
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,833
Like gay, gay, gay,

294
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,367
faggoty blonde.
I'm fucking warning you!

295
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:49,300
"Stay gold, Ponyboy!"
I'm fucking warning you!

296
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:51,201
"Stay gold..."Fuck you!

297
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,830
You fucking cunt!

298
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:54,568
Jesus fucking Christ!

299
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,972
Well, I was fucking mad! Shit!

300
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:58,205
What kind of
fucking crazy...

301
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:03,443
I know who you are.
You guys are...

302
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:04,746
Shut it!

303
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,378
This is so
fucking cool, man!

304
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:10,356
I'm from Boston and I love you guys.
Shit, everybody loves you guys.

305
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:13,485
Maybe I can get on this thing.
You know, bring some raza into this.

306
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:18,191
Hey, is it true that you guys say a
prayer before you grease somebody?

307
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:31,743
And an awesome wailing
was heard throughout heaven.

308
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:35,178
And the terrible hand of the Lord
struck upon the Earth.

309
00:21:35,283 --> 00:21:39,185
And as Almighty God created you,

310
00:21:41,656 --> 00:21:45,422
now he calleth you home!

311
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:52,523
Oops.

312
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:55,193
Busy signal.
Will have to call us back.

313
00:21:56,604 --> 00:21:59,300
Let's have a shot
while we're waiting.

314
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:04,335
I think he took a little piss.

315
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:07,039
That shit was not funny!

316
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:08,945
It just came out
me fucking nose.

317
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:13,917
Thank you, Jesus.
Thought I greased my drawers.

318
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:22,987
No.

319
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,894
I've got connects
all over Beantown, man.

320
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,298
Romeo will hook you up
like a tow truck.

321
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:29,698
No.

322
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:30,793
Why not?

323
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:34,238
We don't have to give you
fucking reasons. Forget it.

324
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:35,741
It's because I'm Mexican,
isn't it?

325
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,777
How dare you, sir,
insinuate such a thing?

326
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,245
The fact that you're a greasy spic,

327
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,112
it's got nothing to do with it.

328
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:46,175
Okay, I'm gonna let you have
that one, but, look, I can do this.

329
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,912
This isn't
rocket surgery.

330
00:22:48,022 --> 00:22:52,015
You guys find the bad guys doing
bad stuff and you kill them, right?

331
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,127
Well, it's not that simple, actually.

332
00:22:54,228 --> 00:22:55,354
Yes, it is.

333
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:56,793
Suppose you're right.

334
00:22:57,631 --> 00:23:01,965
I was just hoping that we was
a bit more artistic about it, I think.

335
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:03,968
Yeah? Well, you ain't.

336
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,536
Now, what do you plan on doing
when you get to US soil?

337
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:15,709
We don't really have, you know,
a succinct plan yet, you know, per se.

338
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:19,310
Haven't really worked it all out,
as it were.

339
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:23,856
As it were.
Not fully developed, per se.

340
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,720
You two leprechaun dicks
need to chill in the greenroom

341
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,126
sipping on some Pellegrino and let
your manager handle the details.

342
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:33,893
And you'd better have
my Cub Scout badge ready.

343
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:36,025
Because if you wanna kick
Yakavetta in the nuts,

344
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:39,400
have him wake up with
a horse head in his bed,

345
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,406
Romeo's got an ace
in the hole for you.

346
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,141
And that's all she wrote.
Everything points in the same direction.

347
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:57,384
Get out.

348
00:24:01,795 --> 00:24:06,095
Look, I have been stonewalling
the media on this thing.

349
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:09,099
I've got half of New England thinking
the Saints whacked the priest

350
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:12,671
and the other half
thinking they're innocent.

351
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:14,672
It's a powder keg.

352
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:18,232
And we're talking riot gear
at Celtics games here.

353
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:20,535
Now, I can clear them
of this murder

354
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:24,014
and take the piss
right out of this thing.

355
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:28,980
Now, give me one reason why I
shouldn't take this public right now.

356
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:33,951
Walk with me, Chief.
Let's talk.

357
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,529
This is not good.

358
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,132
She's gunning
for the boys hard.

359
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:52,709
This broad trying to put a feather
in her cap is gonna get us all locked up.

360
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,936
I mean, this couldn't
be going any worse.

361
00:24:54,045 --> 00:24:55,205
Just calm down.

362
00:24:55,313 --> 00:24:58,805
Calm down? Calm down? You know
they're gonna throw us in the Hoag.

363
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,145
We put half those deranged
sex freaks in there.

364
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:03,150
I hope you guys
like cock sandwiches,

365
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:06,051
because we'll be eating them
for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

366
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:09,484
Now, I understand
you've got a job to do, Chief.

367
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:11,492
But this pint-sized killer
is the only thing

368
00:25:11,629 --> 00:25:13,722
that puts Yakavetta right
in the middle of this.

369
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:16,664
And if Concezio even sniffs
that we on to him,

370
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,769
he puts a bullet
in Napoleon's head,

371
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,998
plants him at the bottom
of the ocean and walks.

372
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,509
Now it is imperative
that we find this little man.

373
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,946
You've said some dumb shit in your days,
but that... I... You know, that... That...

374
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:05,948
What? We're all "assuming"
Smecker didn't tell her.

375
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,883
"Oh, yeah, by the way,
me and 3 Boston detectives

376
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,988
"are accessories to murder.
Pass the malt vinegar."

377
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:13,716
Smecker may have been a lot of things,
but he was a stand-up guy.

378
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,826
And we took an oath.
The 4 of us!

379
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:17,292
Yeah!

380
00:26:17,395 --> 00:26:19,659
Okay! I was just thinking.

381
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:20,753
Well, don't do that.

382
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:21,991
You're no good at it.
Fuck you!

383
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:23,225
You're as dumb
as a fucking heel,

384
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,334
you know that,
you blowjob?

385
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:25,402
Fucking, cocksucking, hard-on...

386
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:29,132
Jesus Christ! Look! We need to
figure out what we're gonna do

387
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,209
when the boys show and start
doing what they do best.

388
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:34,402
Because that's when the shit's
really gonna hit the fan!

389
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:37,013
But everyone is assuming that
the boys are gonna turn up.

390
00:26:37,114 --> 00:26:39,878
We got no way of knowing that
for sure.

391
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:44,316
Yeah, that could totally happen.

392
00:26:45,223 --> 00:26:47,316
They could not come back.

393
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:53,257
What dream world did
you two just slip into?

394
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:55,092
We know the boys.

395
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:59,693
Is there any part of you that thinks
they're just gonna let this slide?

396
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:01,995
Believe this.

397
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,098
They're either on their way
or they're already here.

398
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,910
I thought you said your
car was inconspicuous.

399
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:22,048
Yeah, well, I don't like words
with "spic" right in the middle.

400
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,787
Besides, it is where I live.

401
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:28,297
Yeah? Where's that?
Margaritaville?

402
00:27:28,432 --> 00:27:31,094
Hey, I hail from a colorful people.

403
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:36,403
Besides, you wouldn't know style
if it pitched a tent in your ass.

404
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,272
Ace in the hole time.

405
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:44,244
Been a lot of chatter about Yakavetta
being in bed with the Chinese.

406
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:47,282
This here is little Yaka's yeyo.

407
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,549
All right, here's the plan.

408
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:59,484
Then we skin out, we go to Doc's
for a shot of Irish,

409
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:01,886
we're at home in time for tacos.

410
00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:03,685
That's what we do.

411
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:07,154
What?

412
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:08,320
Well, it's justthis plan...

413
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,057
What the fuck's wrong with the plan?
It's...

414
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,497
It's genius.
I can even drive an f-lift, man.

415
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:15,728
Got my Class D license
and everything.

416
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,464
That's the fucking spirit!

417
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,403
I'm gonna need a gun.

418
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:21,299
Forget it.

419
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:25,175
What the fuck, man? I'm in
on this shit. I'm working here!

420
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:28,207
Okay.

421
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:29,943
For fuck's sake!

422
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:31,416
Here's what you're gonna do.

423
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:36,319
You're gonna consider yourself a
fucking pledge until we tell you different.

424
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:42,556
Can I consider myself
your girlfriend, too?

425
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,894
That's what you get.
Is there a fucking problem?

426
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:49,035
It's fine.

427
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,728
I'm fucking watching you.

428
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,740
You understand me?
Now, you stow that shit.

429
00:29:55,777 --> 00:29:58,507
Don't you worry, Rome.
Shit like this, it builds character.

430
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:01,241
Yeah, the character
of a little bitch.

431
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,016
Now, that's just unprofessional.

432
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,786
So, what do you think?

433
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:14,684
I think Yakavetta killed a good man
just to send us a message.

434
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,956
Well, let's send him
one right back.

435
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,205
# Motoring

436
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,252
#... night

437
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:44,419
#... right

438
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:49,729
# And something
that rhymes with "light"

439
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,100
Why?
I don't know.

440
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:00,465
It's not them.

441
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,276
It's them.

442
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,213
A wise manonce told me,

443
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:13,844
"Where a man's actions are firmly
bound to an unshakable faith,

444
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:18,754
"one's worst nightmares become
sudden, terrifying reality."

445
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:22,354
You didn't have to
bash me in the skull!

446
00:31:22,496 --> 00:31:25,192
Sorry, man, we got
a plan going here.

447
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:27,357
Technically, I was supposed to
knock you out.

448
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:31,369
But they gave me this faggoty little gun,
see, and the weight's just not...

449
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:33,200
Christ, that's a gun?

450
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,832
Why didn't you just point it
at me and say "scram"?

451
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:39,172
Scram! Get the fuck
out of here! Now!

452
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,644
You got it!

453
00:31:40,914 --> 00:31:43,610
Hey, guys, let's not let this one
little incident get in the way of...

454
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:46,049
Shut up and get back
behind the fucking wheel!

455
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,142
Jeez!

456
00:31:47,254 --> 00:31:49,916
Well, at least your plan's
off to a winning start.

457
00:31:50,023 --> 00:31:51,820
Go fuck yourself.

458
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:56,659
Oh, fuck.

459
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:15,037
That's heroin.

460
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:19,642
How the fuck would you know?

461
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:21,686
Fuck you.
I know shit.

462
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:26,082
What's the symbolism here?

463
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:28,185
Symbolism?

464
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,922
Yeah. What does this symbolize?

465
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:35,863
Well, it symbolizes a huge fuck-up.

466
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:39,333
This is a plan that fell to pieces.

467
00:32:39,438 --> 00:32:44,603
A lot of it don't make sense, which is
why it all makes perfect sense.

468
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:47,078
Christ,
what the fuck's he doing?

469
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:48,544
I don't know.
Hang on!

470
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:50,114
Fuck's sake.

471
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:55,250
All right, all right.

472
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:57,787
Christ, he can't fucking see
where he's going!

473
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:02,852
Shit! Turn to the left now!
Tell him!

474
00:33:02,962 --> 00:33:04,862
Go left! Go left!

475
00:33:04,964 --> 00:33:05,953
What?

476
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:07,532
That way! Go that way!

477
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:08,793
Left? Fuck!

478
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:14,934
I can't believe I let you talk me
into this. Fucking stupid plan.

479
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:18,601
It's all in the execution. And your
negative attitude ain't helping any!

480
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:20,109
What? What the fuck?

481
00:33:20,212 --> 00:33:21,236
Negative attitude?

482
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:22,439
My fucking negative attitude?

483
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:23,640
Yeah, your negative attitude!

484
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:25,808
You've got to visualize
the end result!

485
00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:28,785
You've got to force it
into reality! Believe!

486
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:30,252
You've got to fucking believe!

487
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,722
I'm about to believe my fist
right up your fucking ass!

488
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,383
You'll do what?

489
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:37,722
Not a believer!
That's another thing,

490
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,162
don't be down at me, 'cause
I'm right fucking there, man!

491
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:44,496
You've got to believe!

492
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:46,628
This bitch is fast-a-rooney.

493
00:33:46,939 --> 00:33:48,065
Wait.

494
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:50,706
Wait. Wait, hold on.

495
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:51,797
Uppey-downey!

496
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:54,808
Shit!

497
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:09,293
Boys, I believe things
in our fair, little city

498
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:13,359
just got downright biblical.

499
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:19,129
Wait, wait!

500
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:03,471
And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

501
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,878
Power hath descended
forth from Thy hand,

502
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:08,143
that our feet may swiftly carry out
Thy command.

503
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:12,415
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

504
00:35:26,436 --> 00:35:29,405
While the wicked
stand confounded,

505
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:34,373
call me with Thy Saints
surrounded.

506
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,679
Ballistics just dug it out.

507
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:46,984
A.22? You've got
to be kidding me.

508
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,183
That's like bringing
a knife to a gunfight.

509
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:51,988
Yeah, or like bringing
a really small gun

510
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,097
to a gunfight.

511
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,062
I don't know.

512
00:35:58,168 --> 00:36:01,535
Ballistics is reading 3 shooters,
and this is one of them.

513
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:02,764
I find ithard to believe

514
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:04,807
that one of the 3 most lethal
individuals on the planet

515
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:06,738
just switched over to birdshot.

516
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:09,073
Maybe we're reading this wrong.

517
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,272
Priest was a frame job, right?

518
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:14,873
Yeah, maybe somebody's trying
to eliminate some competition here?

519
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,145
Yeah.

520
00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:26,924
No, sir, it's them.

521
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:28,787
Here he comes.

522
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:31,925
Doc!

523
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:33,627
Boys!

524
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:37,968
You're a sight for sore eyes. Come on
in here with that. Get in quick.

525
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:40,670
Get in out of the cold. Come on.

526
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:42,611
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

527
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:46,273
I saw the news channel.

528
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:47,577
Are you boys all right?

529
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:49,584
Sound as an Irish pound, Doc.

530
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:50,710
Is it too late for a shot?

531
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:52,880
The Lord told me you'd be coming.

532
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:54,957
"Doc," he said.
"They'd be coming."

533
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:57,618
And I was to have
everything ready.

534
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:00,957
And I have.
I have everything...

535
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,963
It's all set.

536
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:06,464
This is our Mexican.

537
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:11,328
Nice to meet you, lad.
They call me... Fuck! Ass!

538
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,502
How you doing, Fuck Ass?
I'm Romeo.

539
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:21,339
This used to be a speakeasy
in the '40s.

540
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,680
I only use it
for storage now.

541
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:28,084
Holy shit.

542
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:32,456
This is
so fucking cool!

543
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:34,995
Nobody knows it's up here.
You'll be safe.

544
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,465
You can get in and out
the fire escape.

545
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:43,501
Know what this is?
This is our hideout.

546
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:45,539
We got a fucking hideout, man!

547
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:49,066
What, are you fucking
5 years old?

548
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:54,170
You know, Rome,
we got sticks and blankets.

549
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:56,375
You can make
yourself a fort.

550
00:37:56,518 --> 00:37:58,315
Fuck the both of you, man.
This is fucking sweet.

551
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:00,250
We even got
pinball machines, man.

552
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:06,387
# So let's raise our glass
to better days

553
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:12,599
# Forget the past
and our wicked ways

554
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:19,434
# Let's sing together
this twilight song

555
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:23,307
# And make this spirit
last all night

556
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:27,142
Lobster dick! Look at me!
Lobster dick!

557
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:31,082
# All night long

558
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:44,261
Not this time,
you little shit.

559
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:47,763
We'll see about that,
old man.

560
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:54,270
Would somebody please
come over here and...

561
00:38:54,408 --> 00:38:55,898
Fuck!
Me up the...

562
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:56,998
Ass!

563
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,077
Yes! That's what he done!

564
00:38:58,178 --> 00:39:00,043
That's what he's done
every time!

565
00:39:00,147 --> 00:39:02,843
I took you down, old man,
I took you down!

566
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:35,012
Are you hungry, lad?
I sent Louie out for some sandwiches.

567
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:37,649
I could eat.

568
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,684
Decent work.

569
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:43,087
Do you know what I'm thinking
would be a nice match for the back?

570
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,681
That chocolate hide
with the heavy marbling

571
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:48,260
we've been trying to get rid of
for the last 6 months.

572
00:39:48,362 --> 00:39:50,830
We'll make a leather man
out of you yet, son.

573
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,190
Go to it, lad.

574
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:05,138
I can't help you with that, lads.

575
00:40:05,245 --> 00:40:09,443
But if you need something,
anything, made out of leather,

576
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:11,843
we'd be happyto do the job.

577
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:20,383
How many times
have I been nice to you?

578
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:23,121
How many times do my people
come here and talk to you?

579
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,688
This song and dance is over.
It's over, motherfucker!

580
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:29,635
You didn't see anything!

581
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,307
Noah!

582
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:46,886
No, no, no!

583
00:40:48,088 --> 00:40:51,854
We got to call the polizia, Noah!
We got to call somebody.

584
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:55,855
Noah! No.

585
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:14,609
You young guys
worry too much.

586
00:41:16,716 --> 00:41:18,581
We always bounce back.

587
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,385
Besides, better the chinks
than us, right?

588
00:41:29,328 --> 00:41:31,694
This is some serious shit here!

589
00:41:33,432 --> 00:41:36,128
Something amusing you,
queer bait?

590
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:37,257
No, I was just...

591
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,168
You should be focused
on the next step!

592
00:41:42,273 --> 00:41:46,903
That shipment of H was gonna square
our books for the next 6 months!

593
00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:50,304
Any thoughts on that?

594
00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:52,246
Yeah, I got some
thoughts on that.

595
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:56,880
I was just thinking,
not too serendipitous for us.

596
00:41:56,988 --> 00:41:57,955
You...

597
00:41:59,157 --> 00:42:01,682
It's like the
Roman Empire in here.

598
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:03,920
You even got
concubines and shit.

599
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:07,120
George.
What gives here?

600
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:11,527
Oh, a little cannoli,
shrimp cocktail, huh?

601
00:42:11,636 --> 00:42:14,127
I need to see the boss,
right away.

602
00:42:14,272 --> 00:42:16,399
Jimmy the Gofer, la cortina.

603
00:42:21,646 --> 00:42:23,136
Get over here.

604
00:42:25,116 --> 00:42:27,277
Hey, boss, I just came by
to tell you...

605
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:31,116
Push the talk button,
numb nuts!

606
00:42:32,123 --> 00:42:34,250
Hello, can you
hear me? Over.

607
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:37,157
I can hear you fine. Now what
the fuck are you doing here?

608
00:42:37,295 --> 00:42:39,661
Copy that.
Everything's in motion.

609
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:42,130
All our guys are gunning for
these Jesus freaks.

610
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:44,997
I figure there's no need for me
to be on the streets no more.

611
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:47,161
So, which one of these rooms
do you want me to take, huh?

612
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:49,705
Are your ears fucking painted on?

613
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:52,208
Did I not make it perfectly clear

614
00:42:52,343 --> 00:42:54,436
that you're to stay on the streets
until this is over?

615
00:42:54,546 --> 00:42:55,513
I was...

616
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:57,205
Now get the fuck out of here!

617
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:58,976
Douche bag!

618
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:03,315
And don't come back till I say you can
or you're going back to Brooklyn,

619
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:06,288
you fat fucking
waste of space!

620
00:43:07,158 --> 00:43:10,321
You wanna find something in
Boston that don't wanna be found,

621
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:12,988
my Uncle Cesar is a veterano.

622
00:43:13,097 --> 00:43:15,894
Out the game,
but still got his name.

623
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:19,560
Yakavetta's gunning for you
muchachos, and hard.

624
00:43:19,703 --> 00:43:24,470
Even posted a reward,
like Jesse James-style shit.

625
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:30,813
Anyway, any of his guys that
take you out gets his palm crossed.

626
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:34,750
250 big ones.

627
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:39,184
Quarter mil for us?

628
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:42,156
"Us"? What are you
talking about, "us"?

629
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:47,025
Uncle, why do you
isrespect me in front of my friends?

630
00:43:47,965 --> 00:43:50,399
I'm disrespecting you?

631
00:43:51,235 --> 00:43:54,568
A year ago you were
washing my pots and pans.

632
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:58,565
Well, I don't wash
fucking pots and pans anymore.

633
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:01,109
I'm a part of this Uncle.

634
00:44:01,545 --> 00:44:05,003
Nephew, this is not
my first barbeque.

635
00:44:06,116 --> 00:44:07,708
He's with us.

636
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:12,581
Is he?

637
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:19,194
And is my nephew here
pulling his own weight?

638
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:21,896
A lot of heart.

639
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:34,205
Ahora, Gorgeous George is running
the show right now for little Yaka.

640
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:39,748
And if anyone knows where he is,
it's that fat, fucking ugly perico.

641
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,309
I'll get it out on the wire.

642
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:05,271
Anybody hungry? Maybe
we should stop at an IHOP or...

643
00:45:05,374 --> 00:45:08,400
Shut up!
Romeo's crying.

644
00:45:10,346 --> 00:45:12,143
Fucking assholes!

645
00:45:15,952 --> 00:45:16,976
Shut up!

646
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:28,496
Oh, yeah.

647
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:38,365
Yeah, that feels good.

648
00:45:50,353 --> 00:45:53,516
Somebody had their
Wheaties this morning.

649
00:45:53,623 --> 00:45:55,887
Yeah, get after it, girl.

650
00:45:56,926 --> 00:45:58,359
Oh, that's good.

651
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:03,430
Hey, let's keep this
professional, baby.

652
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:07,093
No offense, but I don't need you
calling me all the time.

653
00:46:09,972 --> 00:46:13,874
What the fuck!
I'll kill you, you fucking bitch!

654
00:46:18,314 --> 00:46:21,249
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

655
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:24,717
I'm sorry I called you that.

656
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:26,844
How courteous
of you to apologize.

657
00:46:26,955 --> 00:46:29,287
Courtesy is so important,
don't you agree?

658
00:46:31,826 --> 00:46:34,056
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm down with that.

659
00:46:34,162 --> 00:46:38,064
Good. Now sit your fat ass down.

660
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:57,949
Where is Concezio Yakavetta?

661
00:46:58,453 --> 00:46:59,545
I don't know.

662
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:02,555
Yeah, there's a lot
you don't know, hoss.

663
00:47:03,158 --> 00:47:07,060
For instance, you're the only
New York guy, George.

664
00:47:07,162 --> 00:47:10,461
Your blood just ain't quite as
blue as the rest of them, is it?

665
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:13,260
Explains why you ain't safely
tucked away in some ivory tower

666
00:47:13,368 --> 00:47:17,498
with the rest of them bigwigs sucking
on cannoli and cocktail shrimp right now.

667
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,097
That's why you're the one he left
on the streets, George.

668
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:24,076
Like you know shit
all of a sudden.

669
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:26,511
Somebody's got to run
our legitimate businesses.

670
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:28,239
Somebody's got to be
out there making...

671
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:31,408
Someone's got to
chum the waters.

672
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:36,854
Bullshit! And I ain't saying
another fucking word to you!

673
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,185
Good. You can just listen.

674
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:42,159
We know Concezio
had that priest killed.

675
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:47,124
Oh! That's another thing
you don't know, I reckon.

676
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:50,030
But then why would he
tell you that, George?

677
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,866
You and your boys on the street,

678
00:47:53,006 --> 00:47:54,633
y'all is bait.

679
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,372
Gorgeous George, huh?

680
00:47:57,877 --> 00:48:00,368
Expendable George is more like it.

681
00:48:04,217 --> 00:48:08,017
By the by, you've got a pretty
nice ass for a fat man.

682
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:14,753
A priest.
Sick fuck, huh?

683
00:48:14,861 --> 00:48:15,919
So, until the Saints get popped,

684
00:48:16,028 --> 00:48:17,222
we're all lambs to the slaughter.

685
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,319
Bing!

686
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,559
And he don't care how many of us
they wipe out in the meantime.

687
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:24,067
What do you need me
to do, Skip?

688
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:26,531
Down the brugliones.

689
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:27,663
What, everyone?

690
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:29,674
North and South?
That could get a little dicey.

691
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:30,765
Fuck their old grudges!

692
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:31,844
Grudges have
nothing to do with it.

693
00:48:31,944 --> 00:48:32,933
They're all in this!

694
00:48:33,045 --> 00:48:34,342
You know I don't take sides.
I don't care, Jo Jo!

695
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:35,471
You know I don't.
You don't take sides?

696
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:36,673
Never me! Never me!
You don't take sides?

697
00:48:36,783 --> 00:48:38,648
You're gonna take my
fucking side on this, Jo Jo!

698
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:40,582
You talk to that mick Jimmy Green.
Here we go again.

699
00:48:40,686 --> 00:48:41,914
Jimmy'll tell you that!

700
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:43,511
Jimmy Green!
Jimmy Green!

701
00:48:43,623 --> 00:48:47,320
I don't care if Jimmy Green hollowed out
your sister like a Chippewa Indian!

702
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:48,893
You're gonna
get in there, Jo Jo,

703
00:48:49,028 --> 00:48:51,428
and you're gonna middle-of-the-road
this fucking thing for me,

704
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:53,498
and you're not
gonna fuck it up!

705
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,193
You tell them everything
that we discussed!

706
00:48:56,302 --> 00:48:58,395
Even the panic room thing?

707
00:48:59,572 --> 00:49:00,596
Sure.

708
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,573
Good. Because that's a nice icebreaker.
They'll like that.

709
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,176
You know, I didn't even know
those things were real.

710
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:07,712
I thought they made that up
for that movie.

711
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:10,248
Remember the one
with the broad and the kid?

712
00:49:10,383 --> 00:49:12,214
The guys in the house?

713
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:14,912
Panic... Panic Room?

714
00:49:15,054 --> 00:49:16,043
No, the other one.

715
00:49:16,155 --> 00:49:17,679
Stop fucking around!

716
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,781
This is serious
shit here, Jo Jo!

717
00:49:19,892 --> 00:49:21,257
You tell them
we meet tomorrow night.

718
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,349
All right.

719
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:23,428
I'll call you with
the fucking location.

720
00:49:23,529 --> 00:49:24,621
Okay.

721
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,856
Fucking thing.

722
00:49:52,191 --> 00:49:54,125
Come on, kid.
It was a fucking...

723
00:49:54,627 --> 00:49:56,094
It was a fucking accident.

724
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:58,460
We can work this out.

725
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,469
He ain't gonna do shit.

726
00:50:05,705 --> 00:50:07,673
You're Italian Kid.

727
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,632
Help us out here.

728
00:50:09,775 --> 00:50:11,003
Think it over.

729
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:13,577
I am his friend.

730
00:50:14,146 --> 00:50:15,977
Fuck him and fuck his friend.

731
00:50:16,082 --> 00:50:18,209
Deal the cards!
He ain't got the balls.

732
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:36,862
What did we do?

733
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,191
Connor.

734
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,677
God! No!

735
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:41,095
Why did they use
his mug shot?

736
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,924
What? No.

737
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,735
Yeah, you remember when he
said he was all embarrassed

738
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:53,673
because that fellow had to hold up
all his long hair behind his head?

739
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,869
Aye.

740
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,280
That's an arm.

741
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,748
Hey, Rocco!

742
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,680
I got the info you wanted, mijo.

743
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:12,424
The place is called Tando's
Tanning Salon on Bunker Hill.

744
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,361
That's where the fucking g? ro
gets his fake bake at.

745
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:24,874
European cut.
Far superior.

746
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:31,741
# Yeah! You've just been paid
So split now

747
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:37,783
Lovely singing voice there, Georgie.
We'd like you to sing for us.

748
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,145
Can you do that for me?

749
00:52:40,289 --> 00:52:42,655
Can you do that for me?

750
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:51,292
It's getting hard to be a gentleman
of fucking leisure around here!

751
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:56,438
I want the name of the shooter you
motherfuckers used on that priest!

752
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:58,063
What priest?

753
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,334
His fucking name!

754
00:52:59,475 --> 00:53:00,442
I don't know who it is!

755
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,908
That's fucking bullshit!

756
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:04,502
It's the truth! Concezio didn't
tell nobody what he was doing

757
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,081
'cause he knew nobody would
have okayed it!

758
00:53:06,182 --> 00:53:10,448
The shooter's an independent contractor!
That's all I fucking know!

759
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:13,283
Where the fuck is Yakavetta hiding?

760
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:16,790
Prudential Building,
40th floor.

761
00:53:17,226 --> 00:53:19,023
Jesus Christ!

762
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:25,096
You meeting someone tonight?

763
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:29,197
Yakavetta's racket chiefs.
Street guys.

764
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,073
Your kind of guys. You could take
a real bite out of crime here.

765
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,201
And I can help you.

766
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:36,505
What the fuck is that?

767
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,513
Nobody forgot what you guys
did to us last time.

768
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,948
Everybody's hiding indoors. They
give out the location an hour before.

769
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:46,180
My uncle's place is closed tonight.
I got the key.

770
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,691
How does Mexican work for you, George?
Do you like that?

771
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:54,820
Doesn't matter to me. I think
I just shit my European-cut Speedos.

772
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:57,960
What's this?

773
00:53:58,067 --> 00:53:59,124
Rosary bead.

774
00:53:59,234 --> 00:54:01,327
Found it pushed under the carpet
near the victim.

775
00:54:01,436 --> 00:54:03,097
Father McKinney wasn't
wearing a rosary,

776
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:06,197
so it's probably
been there a while.

777
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:13,473
The results on all 864 prints
found at the scene.

778
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:16,813
All matched churchgoers
and clergy but one.

779
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,986
Partial on the priest's watch
is still unidentified.

780
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:26,720
No. No, that's horseshit.
Everybody gets printed nowadays.

781
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:30,923
They even are inking up these
snot gobblers in kindergarten now.

782
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:33,432
It's a brick wall anyway.

783
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:35,832
We know Napoleon
was wearing gloves.

784
00:54:35,937 --> 00:54:38,098
The lab got zilch
on the lock and chain.

785
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,708
Even the pennies came up clean.

786
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:43,039
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

787
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:49,417
Man. Daddy would knock that out
like Mike fucking Tyson.

788
00:54:50,652 --> 00:54:51,676
Hey!

789
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:53,219
What? I didn't say nothing.

790
00:54:54,623 --> 00:54:58,024
McKinney wore his watch on his left wrist.
Where was this found exactly?

791
00:54:58,126 --> 00:55:00,594
Right here,
off his left elbow.

792
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:03,289
Just occurred to me that priests
wear the rosary while taking confession.

793
00:55:03,431 --> 00:55:04,955
She's right.
Dolly, get on the phone

794
00:55:05,066 --> 00:55:07,034
and find out which wrist
he wore his rosary on.

795
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:09,160
Duffy, push that partial
through the DMV.

796
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:11,398
David, you put it through Interpol
just to get an ID now.

797
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:13,406
Come on, vamoose!

798
00:55:23,652 --> 00:55:26,780
You took your gloves off,
didn't you, cowboy?

799
00:55:26,922 --> 00:55:31,450
Now why would you go and do
a damn fool thing like that?

800
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:13,662
Just 2 more to go.

801
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:16,969
You guys are gonna
let me go, right?

802
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:20,472
I guess we'll just have to
wait and see, won't we?

803
00:56:20,574 --> 00:56:24,169
Jesus Christ, this is some
embarrassing shit.

804
00:56:24,912 --> 00:56:28,848
Don't worry. We worked on a
sheep farm. Smelled way worse.

805
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:32,108
Although that is right up there.

806
00:56:36,257 --> 00:56:40,023
Yo, spicaroo. More nachos
and m? salsa, capisci?

807
00:56:40,494 --> 00:56:43,019
Hey, and I need
a refill here, pepe.

808
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:49,496
Whoa! Easy! Jesus!

809
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,330
How do, David?

810
00:56:54,441 --> 00:56:55,499
Hey!

811
00:56:56,277 --> 00:56:59,474
We just dumped a text message
from George's cell. Just 2 words.

812
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:04,181
"Silver Peso." It's a Mexican joint
down by the docks.

813
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:07,646
Sent it to his enforcer,
Jo Jo Rhama.

814
00:57:07,755 --> 00:57:10,417
Guess gangsters
got to eat, too, huh?

815
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:12,922
I think I'll drop in
on their little supper,

816
00:57:13,027 --> 00:57:15,085
see if I can
shake things up a bit.

817
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:17,823
Need a bodyguard?

818
00:57:18,697 --> 00:57:21,188
No, thank you, Mike Tyson.
Bye, now.

819
00:57:21,867 --> 00:57:23,061
Bye.

820
00:57:31,243 --> 00:57:33,302
These dagos are
getting antsy, man.

821
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:35,744
I'm getting spicarooed
and pepe'd.

822
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:38,406
All right, calm the fuck down.

823
00:57:39,484 --> 00:57:42,612
You got to stick it out.
Just wait on one more.

824
00:57:46,591 --> 00:57:48,855
He is not with them.

825
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:51,259
It is only the sons.

826
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:54,394
They have
a Spaniard with them.

827
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,464
They will
slaughter everyone.

828
00:57:57,269 --> 00:57:59,237
Let them.

829
00:57:59,404 --> 00:58:01,565
If you kill the sons...

830
00:58:01,907 --> 00:58:03,568
the father will come.

831
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,079
Gentlemen.

832
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:13,248
All right. The gang's all here.

833
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:18,047
Give me my fucking BB gun.

834
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:22,487
No, Rome.
You've earned your stripes.

835
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:29,991
Hey, tighten it up.

836
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:35,830
So?

837
00:58:40,846 --> 00:58:42,507
Where's Gorgeous?

838
00:58:47,886 --> 00:58:49,444
Is that George?

839
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:56,927
What the fuck is that?

840
00:58:57,028 --> 00:58:58,655
It's Irish for,
"You're fucked."

841
00:59:03,468 --> 00:59:05,595
Que viva M? ico, bitches!

842
00:59:39,871 --> 00:59:40,997
I've seen the light!

843
00:59:41,106 --> 00:59:42,937
You guys have really turned me
around on this.

844
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,134
I'm, like, born again and shit!

845
00:59:45,243 --> 00:59:47,074
Should we let him go?

846
00:59:50,348 --> 00:59:53,010
You know what
I think we should do?

847
00:59:53,118 --> 00:59:56,417
I think we should let God decide
if he gets a second chance.

848
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:58,386
What the fuck
you doing?

849
00:59:58,523 --> 01:00:01,523
What the...
No, man, come on.

850
01:00:02,627 --> 01:00:05,027
Hey, what the fuck
you gonna do?

851
01:00:07,766 --> 01:00:10,667
You had best be right
with your Jesus, boy.

852
01:00:20,645 --> 01:00:24,843
Well! Praise be to Jesus!

853
01:00:29,586 --> 01:00:31,110
Georgie.

854
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:32,415
Yeah?

855
01:00:32,555 --> 01:00:35,115
You know all good boys
go to heaven.

856
01:00:38,328 --> 01:00:41,559
You know, that was perhaps one of the
finest examples of spiritual guidance

857
01:00:41,664 --> 01:00:43,256
I've ever had the good fortune
to witness.

858
01:00:43,366 --> 01:00:44,924
It was wonderful,
wasn't it?

859
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:47,468
Mysterious ways,
I tell you, mysterious ways.

860
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,561
You know, it's about time
one of your fucking plans...

861
01:01:01,351 --> 01:01:02,511
Put it down!
Drop the gun!

862
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:04,246
Put the goddamn gun down
right fucking now!

863
01:01:04,354 --> 01:01:06,584
Easy, fellas.
And I'm alone.

864
01:01:11,094 --> 01:01:12,152
He's gone.

865
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:13,320
Who the fuck are you?

866
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:17,559
My name is Eunice Bloom.
And I'm your new guardian angel.

867
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:20,329
The torch was passed to me
by a mutual friend.

868
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:23,439
A mutual friend?
By the name of fucking who?

869
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:28,074
Paul Maximillian
fucking Smecker.

870
01:01:33,049 --> 01:01:35,984
We heard.
He was a good man.

871
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:39,179
Aye. You have
our condolences.

872
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:40,449
And you mine.

873
01:01:40,557 --> 01:01:43,355
Well, I'm glad everybody...
Who the fuck was that guy?

874
01:01:43,493 --> 01:01:46,951
That, I suspect, was the shooter
you boys have been looking for.

875
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:51,523
Who the fuck is this broad?
What the fuck is going on here?

876
01:01:51,668 --> 01:01:54,364
Let's speed this up before your
new sidekick's gotta dig any deeper

877
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:56,131
into his impressive
vocabulary.

878
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:57,433
Oh, no, you didn't!

879
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,871
Oh, yes I did.

880
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:02,943
I am an FBI agent controlling this
investigation from within

881
01:02:03,045 --> 01:02:08,210
in order to ensure that you gentlemen
never see the inside of a prison cell.

882
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,148
Now, I am conspiring to do this
with 3 like-minded individuals

883
01:02:11,253 --> 01:02:13,016
who have aided you
in the past.

884
01:02:13,155 --> 01:02:17,216
Though I have yet to inform them
of my agenda because,

885
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,328
well, a girl's gotta have her fun.

886
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:21,828
Dolly, Duffy and Greenly?

887
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,397
Hmm, the very same.

888
01:02:23,498 --> 01:02:25,022
How are the lads doing?

889
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:29,001
2 of them are scared.
One's just horny.

890
01:02:29,104 --> 01:02:30,366
Bet you I can tell you
which one.

891
01:02:30,472 --> 01:02:32,906
Bet you can't.
Let's save it for group.

892
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,633
Right now we've got
a big problem.

893
01:02:34,743 --> 01:02:36,040
What's that, then?

894
01:02:36,178 --> 01:02:38,009
This simply won't do.

895
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,504
Here's how
it all went down.

896
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:13,613
A secret gathering of the brugliones.
Topic of discussion...

897
01:03:47,815 --> 01:03:49,908
Yakavetta's lost control
of the streets.

898
01:03:50,017 --> 01:03:52,144
They're fighting
over his throne.

899
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:54,811
This was not the work
of the Saints.

900
01:03:55,923 --> 01:03:57,788
Interpol came through.

901
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:02,759
You were right. 5'5".
Gotta be the shooter.

902
01:04:02,863 --> 01:04:03,887
That ain't all.

903
01:04:03,998 --> 01:04:07,957
Short stuff's work visa was signed
by a sponsor that doesn't exist.

904
01:04:08,102 --> 01:04:11,503
Look at the date.
2 months after 9/11.

905
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,104
What? I don't get it.

906
01:04:20,548 --> 01:04:23,949
Someone maneuvered it through
the system using false information

907
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:26,315
during the highest alert
in US history.

908
01:04:26,454 --> 01:04:30,481
Yakavetta's just a gangster.
He ain't got the juice to do that.

909
01:04:30,624 --> 01:04:31,955
You're darn tooting,
he don't.

910
01:04:32,059 --> 01:04:36,462
Irregardless, INS red-flagged it
like a motherfucker.

911
01:04:36,564 --> 01:04:38,361
It's a shit storm.

912
01:04:38,699 --> 01:04:41,759
Something stinks like a pig's ass
in summertime.

913
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:43,700
Come on.
We've got someplace to be.

914
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,807
It's, like, 2:00 a.m.
There's nothing open now.

915
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,366
It's after hours. I mean,
if you want a drink...

916
01:04:50,478 --> 01:04:54,209
37 bodies later, and we're
finally back where it all began.

917
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,975
You boys ever heard of
the Southern expression,

918
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,278
"We have an elephant
in the living room?"

919
01:04:58,385 --> 01:05:01,115
Hope you fellows
brought some peanuts.

920
01:05:03,424 --> 01:05:05,358
What is this?
What is this?

921
01:05:05,493 --> 01:05:08,655
Who the fuck are you? You're either
vice or IAD. You're IAD, aren't you?

922
01:05:08,762 --> 01:05:12,892
Okay, come on, fucking arrest us!
Arrest us! I'm ready! Come on out!

923
01:05:13,032 --> 01:05:15,899
Hands above your head!

924
01:05:18,505 --> 01:05:20,632
Stop it!
God damn it!

925
01:05:21,508 --> 01:05:24,500
You don't write!
You don't fucking call!

926
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:26,203
You should be ashamed
of yourselves!

927
01:05:26,312 --> 01:05:28,542
Get the fuck out of here!

928
01:05:28,681 --> 01:05:31,650
You knew all along?

929
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:32,945
Not keeping in touch
with your old friends!

930
01:05:33,052 --> 01:05:34,019
Fucking bitch!

931
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,087
Shame on you!

932
01:05:35,188 --> 01:05:36,485
You're beautiful, babe!

933
01:05:36,589 --> 01:05:39,057
Thank you!
Oh, thank you!

934
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:40,648
This is the fellow?

935
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:41,784
That's the fellow.

936
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:45,160
He's a Sicilian immigrant,
name of Ottilio Panza.

937
01:05:46,132 --> 01:05:47,429
He'll be front-page news
in the morning,

938
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:50,866
but we have to assume that Yakavetta
already knows we've ID'd his guy.

939
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,404
Can't give him time
to plan-B us.

940
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:56,907
We're hitting him in 48 hours.
That fast enough for you?

941
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:59,671
Should be.
Where is it gonna happen?

942
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:00,768
The Pru.

943
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,110
The Prudential?
What are you, cracked?

944
01:06:03,216 --> 01:06:05,878
Why don't you just do it on center ice
at a fucking Bruins game?

945
01:06:05,985 --> 01:06:09,011
That's where the man is,
so that's where we're going.

946
01:06:09,122 --> 01:06:10,885
No guts, no glory,
green beans.

947
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,458
In fact, we could use
a few extra hands.

948
01:06:13,593 --> 01:06:15,720
That is, if you boys
can still get your Irish on.

949
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:21,495
Hey, I got balls for days, pally.
I'm a fucking sack-o-matic.

950
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:24,195
Yeah.
He's a sack-o-matic.

951
01:06:24,304 --> 01:06:25,635
We're in.
We're in.

952
01:06:25,738 --> 01:06:30,573
All right, you boys have fun. Connor,
Murphy, escort a lady to the door.

953
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,104
You sure you don't want to
hear the plan?

954
01:06:35,215 --> 01:06:37,775
I'm not one to sit here
and brag, but...

955
01:06:37,917 --> 01:06:38,884
Jesus.

956
01:06:38,985 --> 01:06:41,145
...this one's really Picasso.
Shut your hole.

957
01:06:41,253 --> 01:06:43,915
No, I want to critique your
masterpiece with fresh eyes.

958
01:06:44,022 --> 01:06:45,614
Besides, school night.

959
01:06:45,757 --> 01:06:46,781
Got some homework to do.

960
01:06:46,892 --> 01:06:47,881
What's the matter?

961
01:06:47,993 --> 01:06:51,827
Panza knew you guys were in there
tonight and he just let it happen.

962
01:06:52,965 --> 01:06:54,489
I mean, if he's working
for Yakavetta,

963
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,763
why would he just stand by and
watch all his men get taken out?

964
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:00,997
What, you think maybe we've got
another fox in the henhouse, then?

965
01:07:01,138 --> 01:07:02,662
It's starting to look that way.

966
01:07:02,773 --> 01:07:04,934
Somebody pushed that visa through.

967
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:09,001
We could have ourselves a genuine
Ghost and the Darkness here.

968
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,316
They still live.

969
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:24,624
What if he does not come?
What if...

970
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:28,022
He will come.

971
01:07:34,572 --> 01:07:41,273
Either that wily old man
is not as clever as we thought

972
01:07:45,516 --> 01:07:47,780
or he played me from the git.

973
01:07:56,193 --> 01:07:57,922
You think he played me?

974
01:07:58,062 --> 01:08:01,395
We got a mutiny on our hands.

975
01:08:01,532 --> 01:08:06,401
Every 10-cent wannabe with a gun
is moving on us all over town!

976
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:10,769
And our fearless leader hasn't even
come out of his pussy room yet!

977
01:08:11,709 --> 01:08:13,870
Capo fucking regime!

978
01:08:16,147 --> 01:08:21,050
I want each one of you
to call your top button man,

979
01:08:21,152 --> 01:08:23,120
the best that you have.

980
01:08:24,155 --> 01:08:29,218
'Cause we are going to
rip this city a new asshole.

981
01:08:30,995 --> 01:08:32,394
Starting tonight,

982
01:08:34,298 --> 01:08:37,461
we reconnoiter our strength
on the streets.

983
01:08:37,768 --> 01:08:39,235
Starting now,

984
01:08:41,572 --> 01:08:42,971
we seize the day.

985
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:48,134
Law enforcement has classified
the Italian immigrant Ottilio Panza

986
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:51,942
as its prime suspect in the murder
of the beloved local cleric.

987
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:53,846
An all-points bulletin
has been issued,

988
01:08:53,951 --> 01:08:55,885
and it appears,
at least for the time being,

989
01:08:55,987 --> 01:08:59,388
the Saints have been cleared
as suspects in the priest's killing.

990
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:24,640
Foolish, arrogant boy!

991
01:09:32,556 --> 01:09:35,320
Expanded my operations
since I saw you last.

992
01:09:35,459 --> 01:09:38,292
Word got out who may or
may not have outfitted you.

993
01:09:38,396 --> 01:09:41,797
Turns out you got quite
the underground following.

994
01:09:44,001 --> 01:09:48,869
Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers
select from my private reserve.

995
01:09:49,005 --> 01:09:51,132
If I may make a suggestion.

996
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:01,313
# I'm here if you want me

997
01:10:01,418 --> 01:10:03,682
# I ain't gonna
push and shove

998
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:07,188
# 'Cause, baby,
all I really want to be

999
01:10:08,058 --> 01:10:10,049
# Is balls-deep in your love

1000
01:10:10,693 --> 01:10:12,923
# Balls-deep in your love

1001
01:10:13,029 --> 01:10:15,258
# Balls-deep in your love

1002
01:10:15,364 --> 01:10:18,299
I feel like that kid who found
the golden ticket in that candy bar

1003
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,834
in Willy Wonka e Chocolate Factory.

1004
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,362
Charlie.

1005
01:10:22,471 --> 01:10:23,699
Yeah, Charlie.

1006
01:10:24,506 --> 01:10:27,839
And I want an Oompa Loompa now,
Daddy, now.

1007
01:10:35,417 --> 01:10:37,044
I'll take these.

1008
01:10:39,021 --> 01:10:40,579
Have you been crying again?

1009
01:10:40,689 --> 01:10:43,522
Yeah! Tears of joy.

1010
01:10:44,526 --> 01:10:46,357
Those are queer.
How much?

1011
01:10:46,462 --> 01:10:49,363
Oh, no, no.
You boys are on the house.

1012
01:10:49,465 --> 01:10:50,659
Obliged.

1013
01:10:50,766 --> 01:10:52,495
Well, let's see.

1014
01:11:00,109 --> 01:11:01,576
What?
Nothing.

1015
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:02,972
What, are you saying
I look gay?

1016
01:11:03,078 --> 01:11:05,444
No, you just hail
from a colorful...

1017
01:11:05,581 --> 01:11:08,880
Hey, you don't know me.
Do these make me look gay?

1018
01:11:10,752 --> 01:11:13,687
You look like you might have
seen one up close.

1019
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:31,294
On a sultry Saturday in September,
the Saints saved 17 souls.

1020
01:11:35,009 --> 01:11:37,409
Try saying that 5 times fast.

1021
01:11:40,148 --> 01:11:43,447
Nothing to be afraid of.
It's all over.

1022
01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:48,378
Fucking pussy.
He won't come out.

1023
01:11:49,323 --> 01:11:51,223
Special Agent Bloom!

1024
01:11:51,325 --> 01:11:55,284
You are hereby relieved of
all obligation to this investigation.

1025
01:11:55,429 --> 01:12:02,164
And as of now, you will all report to me.
Special Agent John Kuntsler.

1026
01:12:03,304 --> 01:12:06,569
So, how you doing, Bloomy?

1027
01:12:08,843 --> 01:12:11,004
Just fine, Kunty.

1028
01:12:13,548 --> 01:12:15,175
You are suspended.

1029
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:18,147
Fine. But I'm gonna
take a crack at it first.

1030
01:12:29,897 --> 01:12:33,993
They gained access somehow
through one of the service entrances.

1031
01:13:10,972 --> 01:13:11,961
What?

1032
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:13,506
Nothing.

1033
01:13:13,608 --> 01:13:14,597
What is the matter with you?

1034
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:15,903
Nothing!

1035
01:13:16,043 --> 01:13:20,241
This is just some heavy shit, that's all.
I'm just...

1036
01:13:20,781 --> 01:13:22,681
I'm just having
a period of adjustment.

1037
01:13:22,783 --> 01:13:24,546
You're about to have a period of
getting your ass beat!

1038
01:13:25,886 --> 01:13:28,912
This is you.
Fucking be on time.

1039
01:13:38,298 --> 01:13:41,199
You ready for this shit,
my dear brother?

1040
01:13:45,639 --> 01:13:48,164
Let's do some
gratuitous violence.

1041
01:13:50,377 --> 01:13:52,572
Meet! Front and center!

1042
01:13:53,913 --> 01:13:55,346
Make way.

1043
01:14:03,723 --> 01:14:05,213
Each one of you

1044
01:14:05,392 --> 01:14:09,590
is to stick to the guy who
called you like stink on quim.

1045
01:14:11,731 --> 01:14:13,460
Pick your own crews.

1046
01:14:14,434 --> 01:14:16,732
You arm yourself
to the teeth.

1047
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:21,867
And when these Bible-banging psychos
make their attempt,

1048
01:14:21,975 --> 01:14:26,935
it is your job to blow their soulless
hearts right out of their bodies.

1049
01:14:37,956 --> 01:14:40,447
Okay, here's
the situation, Lloyd.

1050
01:14:40,592 --> 01:14:43,618
Me and a couple of friends of mine are
fitting to do some killing here tonight.

1051
01:14:43,762 --> 01:14:46,424
I'm talking bullets, blood,
custom wholesale slaughter.

1052
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:47,726
You follow me, Lloyd-o?

1053
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:52,097
Good. Now, I've run into
a little snag.

1054
01:14:52,204 --> 01:14:55,799
You see, I'm trying to
figure out a tag line.

1055
01:14:55,941 --> 01:14:57,465
You know, something cool to say
when it's all over,

1056
01:14:57,609 --> 01:15:01,010
like, "We're gonna need
a bigger boat."

1057
01:15:01,146 --> 01:15:04,741
Or, "I'll be back." But mine, you know?
I've gotta own this thing.

1058
01:15:05,484 --> 01:15:08,578
It's creative!
It happened to be a creative plan!

1059
01:15:08,687 --> 01:15:09,676
Fucking ridiculous!

1060
01:15:09,788 --> 01:15:12,313
Probably based on some
stupid shit you saw in a movie!

1061
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:15,950
And here I am again, all tying
myself up with fucking rope!

1062
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:17,790
What's the deal with you and
the fucking rope? Honestly!

1063
01:15:17,896 --> 01:15:20,797
It happened to be a very
useful thing, so shut it!

1064
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:23,834
You didn't get this from a movie, did you?

1065
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:27,666
The Eiger Sanction with Clint Eastwood.
Fuck!

1066
01:15:27,806 --> 01:15:29,433
And it worked like a charm for him!

1067
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,509
I fucking knew!

1068
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:36,006
Now I'm gonna take the gag off,
nice and slow so it doesn't hurt.

1069
01:15:38,984 --> 01:15:41,043
I know, I know. I know, I know.

1070
01:15:41,186 --> 01:15:43,484
This fucking hurts this way.

1071
01:15:43,589 --> 01:15:44,988
Fuck! Fuck...

1072
01:15:48,727 --> 01:15:49,819
Fuck!

1073
01:15:49,928 --> 01:15:50,917
I know, I know, I know!

1074
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:52,291
I can't believe you, man!
I'm a janitor.

1075
01:15:52,398 --> 01:15:54,127
What do I know about guns
and bullets and shit, man?

1076
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:55,222
Well, then, just...

1077
01:15:55,334 --> 01:15:56,426
No! I don't care
what you're doing here

1078
01:15:56,535 --> 01:15:58,298
with your fucking friends.
It's none of my business.

1079
01:15:58,404 --> 01:15:59,393
I'm just...

1080
01:15:59,505 --> 01:16:01,063
I have a wife and
a family and kids.

1081
01:16:01,173 --> 01:16:02,799
Actually, they're not
even my kids, right?

1082
01:16:02,907 --> 01:16:04,602
I'm taking care of
some other asshole's kids

1083
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:05,971
on a fucking janitor's salary!

1084
01:16:06,077 --> 01:16:07,476
I'm not riffing, Lloyd!

1085
01:16:07,578 --> 01:16:10,741
Now, I need an hasta la vista line,
toute fucking suite

1086
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:12,509
and you're gonna
help me think of one.

1087
01:16:16,888 --> 01:16:17,855
What the fuck did you do?

1088
01:16:17,955 --> 01:16:18,979
I don't know, it just stopped.

1089
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:20,557
Well, fucking get it going again!

1090
01:16:20,658 --> 01:16:22,091
It won't turn back on!
It just died!

1091
01:16:22,193 --> 01:16:23,251
Shit!

1092
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:24,828
Fucking thing!
Come on!

1093
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:26,920
Come on!
Come on, you piece of shit!

1094
01:16:27,064 --> 01:16:33,435
Starting tonight, each one of you limp-dick
fucking slobs is back out on the street

1095
01:16:33,571 --> 01:16:35,038
earning your daily bread.

1096
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:36,197
Come on, come on! No!

1097
01:16:36,307 --> 01:16:37,740
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up!

1098
01:16:39,544 --> 01:16:42,240
Okay, what about,
"Take that, you suckers"?

1099
01:16:42,346 --> 01:16:43,938
No, that's not
cool enough, man.

1100
01:16:44,048 --> 01:16:45,947
How much time?
How much fucking time?

1101
01:16:46,049 --> 01:16:47,073
60 seconds!

1102
01:16:47,184 --> 01:16:49,015
No, we gotta go right now!
No fucking way!

1103
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:50,108
What are
you talking about?

1104
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,949
If we're even a few seconds late,
Romeo's dead.

1105
01:16:52,088 --> 01:16:57,116
You'd better all dust off your ball bats!
You'd better find your inner gangster!

1106
01:16:57,427 --> 01:17:00,225
"Merry Christmas,
motherfuckers!"

1107
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:01,695
That's too sacrilegious.

1108
01:17:02,098 --> 01:17:04,123
All right, we've got
about 13 floors.

1109
01:17:04,234 --> 01:17:05,633
11 more, ball park it!

1110
01:17:05,735 --> 01:17:08,397
It's about 15 per floor,
we need... 165!

1111
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:09,938
Dude, wait!
Count it up in 5s!

1112
01:17:10,073 --> 01:17:11,802
5, 10, 15, 20...

1113
01:17:11,908 --> 01:17:13,239
This is retarded!

1114
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,537
Fucking
Eiger Sanction!

1115
01:17:14,644 --> 01:17:16,111
Shut it and
concentrate! 25...

1116
01:17:16,246 --> 01:17:19,647
'Cause you got to break bones!
You've got to crush skulls!

1117
01:17:19,783 --> 01:17:22,115
You gotta do
what you gotta do!

1118
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:28,953
You're gonna need those.

1119
01:17:29,292 --> 01:17:30,259
Bang, bang, bang.

1120
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,554
You shoot everybody
in there,

1121
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:36,098
and then you're like,
"Yo, eat it! Eat it!"

1122
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:38,394
What, are we at
a fucking buffet now?

1123
01:17:38,502 --> 01:17:39,764
Fuck.

1124
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,832
You guys can't do this!
Are you fucking crazy?

1125
01:17:42,973 --> 01:17:44,167
Time!

1126
01:17:44,274 --> 01:17:46,071
Jesus Christ.
7 seconds!

1127
01:17:46,176 --> 01:17:47,609
Holy shit!
6,

1128
01:17:47,711 --> 01:17:49,576
5, 4...
It's time.

1129
01:17:49,779 --> 01:17:51,269
3, 2...

1130
01:17:51,715 --> 01:17:55,082
One thing has
always amazed me.

1131
01:17:55,185 --> 01:17:57,085
How quiet it gets.
You ever noticed that?

1132
01:17:58,955 --> 01:18:01,856
It's hard to imagine
that just a few hours ago

1133
01:18:03,293 --> 01:18:07,127
it was the goddamn
O.K. Corral in here.

1134
01:18:30,687 --> 01:18:35,317
We're gonna have ourselves a
good old-fashioned shoot-'em-up!

1135
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:08,474
And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

1136
01:20:08,616 --> 01:20:10,413
Power hath descended
forth from Thy hand,

1137
01:20:10,518 --> 01:20:12,713
that our feet may swiftly carry out
Thy command.

1138
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:16,950
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

1139
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:27,601
Who ordered
the whup-ass fajitas?

1140
01:20:29,704 --> 01:20:30,762
That's fucking stupid!

1141
01:20:30,872 --> 01:20:32,066
It's completely retarded!

1142
01:20:32,173 --> 01:20:34,505
Was that the best
you could do?

1143
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:39,176
I just...

1144
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:41,348
I couldn't...

1145
01:20:42,784 --> 01:20:45,149
Broke down the door,
didn't you?

1146
01:20:53,493 --> 01:20:59,022
Ding-dong, motherfucker,
ding-dong!

1147
01:21:00,567 --> 01:21:02,091
Fucking A.

1148
01:21:02,202 --> 01:21:03,601
You said it.

1149
01:21:05,172 --> 01:21:11,042
And that, gentlemen,
is the sound of the fat lady singing.

1150
01:21:12,245 --> 01:21:14,179
Should we clap
or something?

1151
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:15,475
Shut up.

1152
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,308
Hey, hey! Hey!

1153
01:21:19,519 --> 01:21:21,544
You hurt her, you piece of shit,
I'll kill you!

1154
01:21:21,688 --> 01:21:23,849
She's not on there!
There's nothing on there!

1155
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:26,823
Get a hostage negotiator
down here, you fucking wad!

1156
01:21:26,927 --> 01:21:29,395
Get off me!
What is your fucking problem?

1157
01:21:29,529 --> 01:21:32,896
He could be in there
all touching her and shit.

1158
01:21:33,033 --> 01:21:35,399
Fuck! Come on!

1159
01:21:36,269 --> 01:21:38,703
Look, I was listening
to you out there.

1160
01:21:38,805 --> 01:21:41,365
And that's, like,
exactly what happened.

1161
01:21:41,508 --> 01:21:45,410
And that's what made me think
you were the person to talk to.

1162
01:21:48,949 --> 01:21:51,179
So, Yakavettahad a partner?

1163
01:21:55,388 --> 01:21:59,256
Everybody gave Concezio props for
building the family back up.

1164
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:04,056
"He's such a genius." What bullshit.
It was the Old Man all along.

1165
01:22:04,197 --> 01:22:07,189
Old Man?
Yeah, that's what he called him.

1166
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:12,431
For the last 3 years, every play
we made came straight from him.

1167
01:22:12,572 --> 01:22:14,506
Teaming up
with the Chinese,

1168
01:22:14,608 --> 01:22:17,702
keeping the feud going between
Southie and the North End, everything.

1169
01:22:17,811 --> 01:22:22,771
Concezio worshipped the Old Man
like some kind of fucking Mafia oracle.

1170
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:24,508
I have no idea what
his real name is, though.

1171
01:22:24,618 --> 01:22:26,552
Concezio always
called him the Old Man.

1172
01:22:26,653 --> 01:22:31,886
Think. I mean, did he ever use a
surname or a nickname or something?

1173
01:22:32,492 --> 01:22:33,925
One time.

1174
01:22:34,394 --> 01:22:36,055
Well, what was it?

1175
01:22:37,464 --> 01:22:40,592
He called him the Roman.

1176
01:22:42,502 --> 01:22:44,766
That's just weird.
The Roman?

1177
01:22:46,673 --> 01:22:48,800
What do you think
it means?

1178
01:22:49,976 --> 01:22:51,910
Feels like our ghost to me.

1179
01:22:52,012 --> 01:22:53,639
Well, what's the plan?

1180
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:57,876
'Cause the brothers ain't going nowhere
until we get Panza or they do.

1181
01:23:14,167 --> 01:23:16,396
Sack-o-matic, I said!

1182
01:23:23,676 --> 01:23:24,734
I've got nothing.

1183
01:23:24,844 --> 01:23:26,675
One in the hole.

1184
01:23:26,812 --> 01:23:30,077
Fuck you!
1, 2, 3!

1185
01:23:30,182 --> 01:23:32,207
Boys! Boys!

1186
01:23:32,484 --> 01:23:35,146
Put them down!
Throw them over.

1187
01:23:35,888 --> 01:23:38,322
I'll kill the old man!
Throw them over!

1188
01:23:43,229 --> 01:23:47,563
Brothers, huh?
Oh, we gonna have us some fun.

1189
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:53,001
So, which one first?
Which one do you love more?

1190
01:23:53,137 --> 01:23:54,661
This one?

1191
01:24:08,052 --> 01:24:11,488
Doc! Call a fucking
ambulance right now!

1192
01:24:14,993 --> 01:24:16,051
You.

1193
01:24:18,663 --> 01:24:20,460
Where's the Old Man?

1194
01:24:21,399 --> 01:24:22,559
Never.

1195
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,340
Just hold on, man.

1196
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:40,713
Help's on the way,
hang in there!

1197
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,687
Boys, it's over.

1198
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:51,751
It's okay.
Proudest day of my life.

1199
01:25:08,046 --> 01:25:09,013
Da!

1200
01:25:09,113 --> 01:25:10,444
Easy, boys.

1201
01:25:22,994 --> 01:25:24,689
Jesus fucking Christ!

1202
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,559
I'm gonna blow this motherfucker's
brains out right now!

1203
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,359
Connor!

1204
01:25:29,466 --> 01:25:33,402
Son, Daddy's working.

1205
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,903
What the fuck
you talking about?

1206
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:43,036
Where is he?

1207
01:25:43,146 --> 01:25:47,139
No matter how this turns out,
you fucking die today!

1208
01:25:47,284 --> 01:25:49,309
Believe it, motherfucker.

1209
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,220
Where is the Old Man?

1210
01:26:07,804 --> 01:26:09,897
Make me famous.

1211
01:26:22,119 --> 01:26:23,177
Where?

1212
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:30,458
Where is he?

1213
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:11,923
You look good, Roc.

1214
01:27:12,034 --> 01:27:13,501
You two don't.

1215
01:27:15,004 --> 01:27:17,063
Yeah, we had a friend...

1216
01:27:17,173 --> 01:27:18,333
I know.

1217
01:27:19,408 --> 01:27:21,171
He was a big boy.

1218
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:23,006
If it weren't for us,
maybe the 2 of you would...

1219
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:26,081
Would what? Would never
have stood for anything?

1220
01:27:26,215 --> 01:27:27,580
What are you
talking about, Roc?

1221
01:27:27,716 --> 01:27:31,675
I made my decision and stood
next to you. And it was an honor.

1222
01:27:32,555 --> 01:27:37,049
And I wouldn't change that for
the whole world. Not one minute of it.

1223
01:27:37,193 --> 01:27:38,888
Now, sl? nte.

1224
01:27:49,405 --> 01:27:52,863
You know, he was sort of a
bad-ass, though, wasn't he?

1225
01:27:54,043 --> 01:27:55,908
Shades of Eastwood.

1226
01:27:56,712 --> 01:27:58,543
Charlie Bronson.

1227
01:27:58,647 --> 01:28:00,740
Duke fucking Wayne!

1228
01:28:00,883 --> 01:28:03,181
Duke fucking Wayne!

1229
01:28:03,285 --> 01:28:06,516
Men build things.
Then we die.

1230
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:12,186
It's in our fucking DNA!
That's what we do!

1231
01:28:12,294 --> 01:28:14,353
And when it all falls down...

1232
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:16,522
We build it right back up again.

1233
01:28:16,632 --> 01:28:18,896
But this time bigger. Better!

1234
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:20,935
Look! Look what we can do.

1235
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:23,766
Look how fucking
beautiful we are.

1236
01:28:23,906 --> 01:28:26,374
You think the men that
built all this had it easy?

1237
01:28:26,475 --> 01:28:27,442
Hard men!

1238
01:28:27,543 --> 01:28:28,567
Doing hard shit!

1239
01:28:28,677 --> 01:28:31,237
And that gives me
a hard-on!

1240
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:32,643
But not in a gay way
or anything.

1241
01:28:32,747 --> 01:28:33,873
No, no, course not.

1242
01:28:33,982 --> 01:28:35,643
Yeah, goes without saying.

1243
01:28:35,783 --> 01:28:40,652
I am so sick of this
self-help, 12-step,

1244
01:28:40,788 --> 01:28:44,087
leftover hippie
generation bullshit!

1245
01:28:44,192 --> 01:28:47,389
Now they don't want you to do anything,
right? Just sit there! Don't drink...

1246
01:28:47,495 --> 01:28:49,827
Don't smoke!
Don't drive fast!

1247
01:28:49,964 --> 01:28:51,795
Kiss my ass!

1248
01:28:51,933 --> 01:28:54,424
Fuck it, do it all, I say!

1249
01:28:54,536 --> 01:28:56,265
You think Duke Wayne
spent all his time

1250
01:28:56,371 --> 01:28:59,272
talking about his feelings
with a fucking therapist?

1251
01:28:59,374 --> 01:29:01,501
There's no
fucking way he did!

1252
01:29:01,643 --> 01:29:06,945
John Wayne died with 5 pounds of
undigested red meat in his ass!

1253
01:29:07,048 --> 01:29:11,280
Now that's a man!
Real men hide their feelings. Why?

1254
01:29:11,386 --> 01:29:14,651
Because it's none of
your fucking business!

1255
01:29:14,789 --> 01:29:17,986
Men do not cry,
men do not pout,

1256
01:29:18,092 --> 01:29:21,528
men jack you
in the fucking jaw and say...

1257
01:29:24,999 --> 01:29:26,466
Thanks for coming out.

1258
01:29:39,514 --> 01:29:43,280
I am so sorry, boys.
This was all my fault.

1259
01:29:45,753 --> 01:29:48,380
There's a few things your dad
needs to tell youse.

1260
01:29:49,223 --> 01:29:52,784
Come on, kid, it's good for you,
it's good for us.

1261
01:29:52,893 --> 01:29:55,225
We'll take you right out
the back of this place.

1262
01:29:55,362 --> 01:29:56,420
Easy, Noah.

1263
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:58,020
They'll never touch you.

1264
01:30:01,368 --> 01:30:02,335
Oh!

1265
01:30:08,341 --> 01:30:10,673
What, are you stupid
or something?

1266
01:30:29,462 --> 01:30:35,196
Noah, mio amico.
No more of this!

1267
01:30:43,142 --> 01:30:44,609
I can't stop.

1268
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:53,585
Okay, we think of
something, eh?

1269
01:30:54,453 --> 01:30:55,579
We think of something.

1270
01:30:56,555 --> 01:30:59,080
Noah, look.

1271
01:31:01,827 --> 01:31:03,920
We got something for you.

1272
01:31:06,632 --> 01:31:07,724
My friend...

1273
01:31:32,358 --> 01:31:35,293
Bonnavese is always with 2 men.

1274
01:31:35,394 --> 01:31:38,761
Both of them, La Cosa Nostra,
many years.

1275
01:32:20,539 --> 01:32:23,167
That's how it went
for years.

1276
01:32:24,176 --> 01:32:29,478
Louie would do all the planning
and I would do the other.

1277
01:32:30,249 --> 01:32:31,307
Jesus.

1278
01:32:31,417 --> 01:32:32,748
How'd you end up
inside, Da?

1279
01:32:34,587 --> 01:32:38,023
Back in '75
I did a piece of work.

1280
01:32:39,558 --> 01:32:42,584
I come out and the police
was waiting for me.

1281
01:32:44,397 --> 01:32:47,889
He set me up.
25 to life.

1282
01:32:48,801 --> 01:32:50,826
Why did he set you up?

1283
01:32:50,936 --> 01:32:53,666
I can't wait to ask him.

1284
01:32:53,773 --> 01:32:57,174
Why didn't you flip on him, Da?
The guy fucked you.

1285
01:32:58,544 --> 01:33:01,274
He had learned
of the birth of my sons.

1286
01:33:03,815 --> 01:33:09,811
# As I turn back the years
with my eyes full of tears

1287
01:33:09,921 --> 01:33:15,483
# There's some things
I can barely see

1288
01:33:15,592 --> 01:33:18,493
# Just so pure and true

1289
01:33:18,595 --> 01:33:21,086
# How we loved
and no one knew

1290
01:33:21,799 --> 01:33:24,029
Hello, my old friend.

1291
01:33:24,635 --> 01:33:26,865
Many years.

1292
01:33:29,306 --> 01:33:31,297
Are you in need?

1293
01:33:31,575 --> 01:33:34,203
I am making marinara and alas...

1294
01:33:34,411 --> 01:33:36,811
I have run outof tomatoes.

1295
01:33:38,582 --> 01:33:40,209
To help an old friend...

1296
01:33:40,584 --> 01:33:42,074
how many can you spare?

1297
01:33:43,287 --> 01:33:45,050
Don't worry.

1298
01:33:45,956 --> 01:33:48,789
You are in luck.

1299
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:52,988
I am
in good supply of tomatoes.

1300
01:33:58,435 --> 01:34:01,404
Agent Kuntsler, you gotta see this.
We just found...

1301
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,808
It's Bloom. She just back-doored
this info from Fed archives.

1302
01:34:09,446 --> 01:34:11,073
Jesus Christ,
she's gone rogue!

1303
01:34:11,181 --> 01:34:12,239
Get an APB on her!
John!

1304
01:34:12,349 --> 01:34:14,112
I want that crazy bitch
grabbed up now!

1305
01:34:14,218 --> 01:34:15,242
John, think about this!

1306
01:34:15,352 --> 01:34:16,649
Jimmy!

1307
01:34:17,454 --> 01:34:18,921
What the fuck are you doing?

1308
01:34:19,556 --> 01:34:22,423
Who the fuck is this?

1309
01:34:27,464 --> 01:34:30,865
He's in York, Maine. About an hour
from here. But he's off the grid.

1310
01:34:31,702 --> 01:34:34,193
Logged on to an FBI database
to get the info.

1311
01:34:34,371 --> 01:34:37,306
Only a matter of time
before they flag it.

1312
01:34:37,641 --> 01:34:40,701
Better get a move on or
they'll get there before you do.

1313
01:34:40,844 --> 01:34:42,835
Will they know it's you?

1314
01:34:44,081 --> 01:34:45,548
Yeah.

1315
01:34:47,517 --> 01:34:49,712
Will you be
all right, dear?

1316
01:34:52,355 --> 01:34:54,550
I hear Costa Rica's nice.

1317
01:35:01,364 --> 01:35:07,030
I never thought I'd ask this of another
human being, but please, kill this man.

1318
01:35:07,937 --> 01:35:10,531
Kill this man.

1319
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:41,655
Hello, Louie.

1320
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,150
Noah.

1321
01:37:45,093 --> 01:37:46,958
We haven't much time.

1322
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,528
My garden is...

1323
01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:58,701
She's beautiful, no?

1324
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:05,211
But I forget, your eyes are blind
to beauty.

1325
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:08,510
You are...

1326
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:12,382
You are a destroyer, Noah.

1327
01:38:14,788 --> 01:38:16,585
You know my reasons.

1328
01:38:17,858 --> 01:38:19,826
But do you?

1329
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:24,227
You think it's...
You think it's for your father.

1330
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:31,231
No. You were born a killer.

1331
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:36,865
Death, la morte,
it is in the blood.

1332
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:38,900
No.

1333
01:38:40,447 --> 01:38:41,505
No.

1334
01:38:46,286 --> 01:38:48,846
This is bullshit.
We should go now.

1335
01:38:49,957 --> 01:38:52,050
It's only one fucking guy.

1336
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,620
Explain these.

1337
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:12,634
You were not there
to raise them.

1338
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:16,306
Not one single day.

1339
01:39:17,317 --> 01:39:22,277
But how closely they followed
their father's footsteps.

1340
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:28,388
They got your blood,
Noah, tua rabbia.

1341
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:30,488
Your anger.

1342
01:39:59,224 --> 01:40:02,489
And you?
What are you?

1343
01:40:03,195 --> 01:40:06,028
I am a creator.

1344
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:09,630
You see,

1345
01:40:11,536 --> 01:40:13,265
we were opposed.

1346
01:40:14,506 --> 01:40:20,308
As old as la storia di frog and...

1347
01:40:24,015 --> 01:40:25,312
Scorpion.

1348
01:40:32,224 --> 01:40:34,658
Remember, not a scratch
on the Old Man.

1349
01:40:36,428 --> 01:40:39,226
Copy that.
Waiting for the signal.

1350
01:40:41,366 --> 01:40:43,493
What the fuck is this place?
It gives me the creeps.

1351
01:40:44,736 --> 01:40:47,068
Why did you sell me out, Louie?

1352
01:40:48,106 --> 01:40:50,165
You can
never understand.

1353
01:40:53,111 --> 01:40:55,739
25 years.

1354
01:40:58,283 --> 01:40:59,443
Try me.

1355
01:41:00,252 --> 01:41:02,243
They were building something.

1356
01:41:02,754 --> 01:41:03,846
They?

1357
01:41:04,823 --> 01:41:08,224
They were creating something.
An empire.

1358
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:09,725
They?

1359
01:41:09,828 --> 01:41:11,386
I was helping them!

1360
01:41:12,697 --> 01:41:14,358
I used you, Noah,

1361
01:41:15,267 --> 01:41:20,500
to destroy their competition,
to cut out their cancers.

1362
01:41:23,475 --> 01:41:26,103
I earned my place
among them.

1363
01:41:30,248 --> 01:41:34,685
Is this your place amongst them?
Because all I see

1364
01:41:36,054 --> 01:41:38,784
is an old man
in a broke-down palace,

1365
01:41:40,225 --> 01:41:41,920
sitting in a garden.

1366
01:41:44,129 --> 01:41:48,395
The scorpion and the frog

1367
01:41:49,801 --> 01:41:51,860
both lose everything.

1368
01:41:52,771 --> 01:41:59,643
See, without you,
I was no longer useful to them.

1369
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,243
They cast me out!

1370
01:42:07,986 --> 01:42:10,546
My old man used to tell me
about a place like this.

1371
01:42:10,655 --> 01:42:12,816
Back in the woods,
he said that there's this guy...

1372
01:42:13,992 --> 01:42:15,960
Why the priest, Louie?

1373
01:42:17,095 --> 01:42:20,394
Why all this? Why now?

1374
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:26,069
Because I knew it would
bring you and your sons.

1375
01:42:27,272 --> 01:42:32,073
You will destroy the Yakavettas
for me. Clear my way.

1376
01:42:33,011 --> 01:42:39,245
And this time,
I will take what is mine. Just...

1377
01:42:40,217 --> 01:42:44,278
Just a little piccolo pezzo.

1378
01:42:46,357 --> 01:42:49,154
For my old age.

1379
01:42:50,793 --> 01:42:56,425
After all, I have never
been a greedy man.

1380
01:45:22,878 --> 01:45:23,845
Beyond the River,

1381
01:45:23,945 --> 01:45:26,413
done by Anthony and Harrison,
Edison Records.

1382
01:45:26,515 --> 01:45:27,914
Connor!

1383
01:45:31,019 --> 01:45:32,179
Murph!

1384
01:45:35,323 --> 01:45:38,087
Take me to him!
Take me to him now!

1385
01:45:54,876 --> 01:45:58,039
I'll see you in a minute, Louie.

1386
01:46:09,323 --> 01:46:12,019
No, Da! No, please!

1387
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,388
God, no!

1388
01:46:16,163 --> 01:46:18,495
Look! Look, boys.

1389
01:46:24,705 --> 01:46:26,400
It's so beautiful.

1390
01:46:28,909 --> 01:46:30,501
It's a beautiful day.

1391
01:46:30,611 --> 01:46:31,635
No.

1392
01:46:35,182 --> 01:46:37,878
It is, Da. It is.

1393
01:46:45,859 --> 01:46:47,520
It is beautiful, Da.

1394
01:46:51,232 --> 01:46:53,860
Aye, it is, Da.

1395
01:47:50,156 --> 01:47:52,624
And they
that holdest my name

1396
01:47:55,828 --> 01:47:58,661
shall come with
the shaking of the earth

1397
01:48:00,099 --> 01:48:02,397
and the roiling
of the oceans.

1398
01:48:24,657 --> 01:48:28,286
It's a non-extradition country.
Passport under your name.

1399
01:48:28,394 --> 01:48:31,795
Money, contacts and a map
to your final destination.

1400
01:48:31,898 --> 01:48:32,887
Which is?

1401
01:48:32,999 --> 01:48:34,796
The monastery at Saint Escaz?

1402
01:48:34,901 --> 01:48:36,596
A monastery?

1403
01:48:36,703 --> 01:48:38,933
Monasteries enjoy the protection
of the Holy See.

1404
01:48:39,038 --> 01:48:43,475
They're not even subject to local laws,
searches, et cetera.

1405
01:48:43,576 --> 01:48:45,874
A sanctuary
within a sanctuary.

1406
01:48:46,012 --> 01:48:48,981
He's going to take you by boat to
a private airstrip down the shore,

1407
01:48:49,082 --> 01:48:53,450
where we have arranged for your travel.
Off the books, of course.

1408
01:48:54,186 --> 01:48:56,313
Father, I ain't one
to look a gift horse,

1409
01:48:56,421 --> 01:48:59,219
but you still haven't told me
how you're involved in all this.

1410
01:48:59,358 --> 01:49:00,620
And the second
I need to disappear,

1411
01:49:00,726 --> 01:49:04,162
you show up with plans
and paperwork in hand.

1412
01:49:04,262 --> 01:49:06,662
It's like you knew
before I did.

1413
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:10,996
The Lord works in mysterious ways,
my dear.

1414
01:49:12,003 --> 01:49:14,801
We wanted you to know
that you're not alone.

1415
01:49:14,906 --> 01:49:17,500
We have many resources.

1416
01:49:17,609 --> 01:49:20,338
You keep saying "we."
Now, who's "we"?

1417
01:49:21,178 --> 01:49:22,907
You ready to go?

1418
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:37,022
I hear they party pretty hard
at that monastery.

1419
01:49:54,912 --> 01:49:55,879
Oh.

1420
01:49:57,281 --> 01:50:01,581
I'm not sure I'm in love with that
new look there, Betty Boop.

1421
01:50:03,287 --> 01:50:05,983
I attended your funeral,
you son of a bitch!

1422
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:09,116
I know. Loved your shoes.

1423
01:50:09,994 --> 01:50:13,293
The skirt was a little risqu?
for a funeral, but, hey,

1424
01:50:14,765 --> 01:50:19,429
who am I to begrudge someone
their sense of individuality?

1425
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:20,730
What is this?

1426
01:50:20,838 --> 01:50:22,271
Keep it down.

1427
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:25,900
You don't wanna scare away
my little fishies.

1428
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,908
Fuck your fish!
What the hell is going on here?

1429
01:50:32,016 --> 01:50:34,314
You are exposed,
young lady!

1430
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:40,216
You're a very clever little girl, Eunice.
That's why I chose you.

1431
01:50:41,525 --> 01:50:46,053
Now it's time for you
to put your thinking cap on.

1432
01:50:48,966 --> 01:50:51,332
We got all the financial backing
and protection

1433
01:50:51,469 --> 01:50:53,937
of the biggest corporation
in the world.

1434
01:50:54,038 --> 01:50:57,997
And 2 CEOs worthy
of the public trust.

1435
01:50:59,977 --> 01:51:03,413
Now, what do you think
is going on here?

1436
01:51:05,783 --> 01:51:07,580
You wanna get them out.

1437
01:51:07,685 --> 01:51:09,482
I want to get them out,
get them back to work,

1438
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:12,350
take this thing to
a whole new level.

1439
01:51:12,490 --> 01:51:13,787
Where're they being held?

1440
01:51:18,128 --> 01:51:23,259
Set them free! Set them free!

1441
01:51:34,512 --> 01:51:38,209
Set them free!

1442
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:47,714
The Hoag ain't just any prison.

1443
01:51:47,858 --> 01:51:51,692
Wrong. That's exactly
what it is, just a prison.

1444
01:51:51,829 --> 01:51:56,698
Run by men.
Men, as we both know, are fallible.

1445
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:03,433
Well, whatever we do,
we gotta do it quick.

1446
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:05,735
Those boys aren't safe in there.

1447
01:52:06,676 --> 01:52:08,166
Oh, I don't know.

1448
01:52:08,278 --> 01:52:13,511
A little birdie tells me
they're gonna be just fine.

1449
01:52:15,752 --> 01:52:18,585
# The saints are coming

1450
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:21,851
# The saints are coming

1451
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:25,093
# I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply

1452
01:52:25,194 --> 01:52:27,992
# The saints are coming

1453
01:52:28,097 --> 01:52:31,362
# The saints are coming

1454
01:52:31,634 --> 01:52:36,661
# I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply

1455
01:53:02,764 --> 01:53:05,494
# A drowning sorrow floods
the deepest grief

1456
01:53:05,601 --> 01:53:07,728
# How long now?

1457
01:53:08,236 --> 01:53:11,728
# Until a weather change
condemns belief

1458
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:13,740
# The stone says

1459
01:53:14,509 --> 01:53:17,967
# This paternal guide
once had his day

1460
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,911
# Once had his day

1461
01:53:24,519 --> 01:53:27,352
# The saints are coming

1462
01:53:27,456 --> 01:53:30,584
# The saints are coming

1463
01:53:30,993 --> 01:53:33,859
# I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply

1464
01:53:33,961 --> 01:53:36,930
# The saints are coming

1465
01:53:37,031 --> 01:53:39,966
# The saints are coming

1466
01:53:40,267 --> 01:53:43,430
# I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply

1467
01:53:43,537 --> 01:53:46,506
# I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply

1468
01:53:46,607 --> 01:53:53,536
# I say no matter how I try,
I realize there's no reply

1469
01:54:05,426 --> 01:54:09,089
# I know there's
something happening here

1470
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:13,696
# I know there's something
happening here

1471
01:54:15,336 --> 01:54:20,069
# Do my eyes
deceive my ears?

1472
01:54:23,944 --> 01:54:26,606
# Can you feel that, man?

1473
01:54:28,816 --> 01:54:31,376
# Can you feel that, man?

1474
01:54:33,888 --> 01:54:35,446
# I sure as hell can

1475
01:54:36,624 --> 01:54:38,558
# Can you feel that, man?

1476
01:54:58,345 --> 01:55:02,372
# 2,000 years
I've reigned

1477
01:55:04,018 --> 01:55:06,578
# As the King of Man

1478
01:55:08,055 --> 01:55:14,688
# And every morning
you felt my guiding hand, yeah

1479
01:55:17,198 --> 01:55:20,395
# What'd you do to deserve me?

1480
01:55:21,602 --> 01:55:26,005
# I spread my wings
and my minions sing

1481
01:55:26,307 --> 01:55:28,707
# I know you heard it, man

1482
01:55:30,144 --> 01:55:33,307
# Yet my sun
still shines on your back

1483
01:55:33,981 --> 01:55:36,040
# Your mountains, your sins

1484
01:55:40,454 --> 01:55:44,220
# You gotta come to me

1485
01:55:45,126 --> 01:55:48,993
# You gotta come to me

1486
01:55:49,896 --> 01:55:53,354
# With your arms
outstretched, baby

1487
01:55:53,466 --> 01:55:54,797
# You better come to me

1488
01:55:54,901 --> 01:55:56,368
# And on your knees

1489
01:55:59,239 --> 01:56:03,300
# 'Cause I'm your holy

1490
01:56:03,409 --> 01:56:05,639
# Your holy fool

1491
01:56:06,279 --> 01:56:08,679
# I am your holy fool

1492
01:56:08,782 --> 01:56:12,809
# Yes, I'm your holy

1493
01:56:12,919 --> 01:56:15,387
# Your holy fool

1494
01:56:15,755 --> 01:56:18,315
# I am your holy fool

1495
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:30,699
# Power has descended forth
from my hand

1496
01:56:31,304 --> 01:56:34,068
# I know you felt it, man

1497
01:56:34,974 --> 01:56:38,603
# Yet my sun
still shines on your back

1498
01:56:39,012 --> 01:56:41,309
# Your mountains, your sins

1499
01:56:42,614 --> 01:56:43,581
# Yeah

1500
01:56:44,616 --> 01:56:47,847
# Yes, I know
that you fear me

1501
01:56:48,987 --> 01:56:52,946
# I call upon you
from my holy hill

1502
01:56:53,725 --> 01:56:56,353
# Sometimes I ask you to live

1503
01:56:56,628 --> 01:56:58,721
# Sometimes to kill

1504
01:56:59,364 --> 01:57:00,388
# Oh, yeah

1505
01:57:00,833 --> 01:57:03,529
# Sometimes I ask you to kill

1506
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:11,674
# You gotta come to me

1507
01:57:12,711 --> 01:57:16,613
# You gotta come to me

1508
01:57:17,349 --> 01:57:20,841
# With your arms
outstretched, baby

1509
01:57:20,953 --> 01:57:22,284
# You better come to me

1510
01:57:22,387 --> 01:57:23,718

# 'Cause I'm your holy...
