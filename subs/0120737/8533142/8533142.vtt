516
00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:54.494
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

517
00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:05.630
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.

1001
01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:37.325
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

1002
01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:39.369
Men?

1003
01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:43.540
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

1004
01:31:43.623 --> 01:31:48.128
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

1005
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:52.007
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

1006
01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:53.758
I was there, Gandalf.

1007
01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:57.262
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...</i>

1008
01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:06.563
<i>...when Isildur took the Ring.</i>

1009
01:32:06.646 --> 01:32:10.608
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

1010
01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:15.697
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

1011
01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:20.910
<i>ELROND: I led Isildur into the hear'!
of Mount Doom...</i>

1012
01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:24.748
<i>...where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.</i>

1013
01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:27.459
Cast it into the fire!

1014
01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:30.628
[VOICE OF THE RING
WHISPERS IN BLACK SPEECH]

1015
01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:36.426
-Destroy it!
-No.

1016
01:32:37.761 --> 01:32:39.929
Isildur!

1017
01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:45.143
<i>ELROND: It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.</i>

1018
01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:53.485
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

1019
01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:58.114
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

1020
01:32:58.198 --> 01:33:03.161
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.

1021
01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:06.664
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

1022
01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:12.212
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

1023
01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:14.464
He has chosen exile.

1024
01:33:45.703 --> 01:33:47.747
You are no Elf.

1025
01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.958
Men of the South are welcome here.

1026
01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:54.045
-Who are you?
-I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

1027
01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:58.383
Then we are here on common purpose...

1028
01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:00.218
...friend.

1029
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.319
The shards of Narsil.

1030
01:34:21.781 --> 01:34:26.244
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

1031
01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:31.416
It's still sharp.

1032
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.386
But no more than a broken heirloom.

1033
01:35:10.205 --> 01:35:13.249
Why do you fear the past?

1034
01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:19.464
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

1035
01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:23.134
You are not bound to his fate.

1036
01:35:23.635 --> 01:35:27.639
The same blood flows in my veins.

1037
01:35:30.642 --> 01:35:33.228
The same weakness.

1038
01:35:35.939 --> 01:35:38.816
Your time will come.

1039
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:43.321
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:15.410
[Sindarin] <i>Nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen.</i>
[English] I thought I had strayed into a dream.

1044
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:18.990
[Sindarin] <i>Gwenwin in enninath.</i>

[Sindarin] <i>Ú-'arnech in naeth i si celich.</i>
[English] You did not wear the troubles you carry now.

1046

[Sindarin] <i>Renich i beth i pennen?</i>
[English] Do you remember what I told you?

1047
01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:36.541
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

1048
01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:43.548
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

1049
01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:46.592
And to that I hold.

1050
01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:50.346
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

1051
01:36:50.596 --> 01:36:54.475
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

1052
01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:06.696
I choose a mortal life.

1053
01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:12.285
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...

1054
01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:18.041
...like my heart.

1055
01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:37.602
ELROND: Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

1056
01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:41.647
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

1057
01:37:42.273 --> 01:37:47.153
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

1058
01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:50.990
You will unite, or you will fall.

1059
01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:55.411
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

1060
01:37:57.246 --> 01:38:00.750
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

1061
01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:16.557
So it is true.

1062
01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:36.119
In a dream...

1063
01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:40.832
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

1064
01:38:41.124 --> 01:38:42.834
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

1065
01:38:43.626 --> 01:38:45.378
A voice was crying:

1066
01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:48.589
"Your doom is near at hand.

1067
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:52.343
Isildur's Bane is found."

Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

1076
01:39:27.295 --> 01:39:31.090
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

1077
01:39:31.174 --> 01:39:33.342

...may yet be heard...

1079
01:39:35.136 --> 01:39:38.222
...in every corner of the West!

1080
01:39:38.306 --> 01:39:41.017
The Ring is altogether evil.

1081
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:42.852
It is a gift.

1082
01:39:43.436 --> 01:39:45.521
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

1083
01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:48.316
Why not use this Ring?

1084
01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:51.277
<i>Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...</i>

1085

...are your lands kept safe.

1087

Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1088
01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:08.419
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

1089
01:40:09.045 --> 01:40:13.132
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1090
01:40:13.216 --> 01:40:16.802
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

1091
01:40:17.094 --> 01:40:19.096
This is no mere Ranger.

1092
01:40:20.097 --> 01:40:23.768
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1093
01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:27.188
You owe him your allegiance.

1094
01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:33.194
Aragorn.

1095
01:40:34.946 --> 01:40:37.782
This is Isildur's heir?

1096
01:40:40.117 --> 01:40:42.828
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

Gondor has no king.

Gondor needs no king.

1100
01:41:02.807 --> 01:41:06.477
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1101
01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:10.982
You have only one choice.

1102
01:41:11.232 --> 01:41:13.609

...by any craft that we here possess.

The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

1109

Only there can it be unmade.

1110
01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:53.399
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1111
01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:57.361
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

One does not simply walk into Mordor.

Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

There is evil there
that does not sleep.

The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

1122

Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

01:45:19.396 --> 01:45:22.066
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1162
01:45:23.651 --> 01:45:25.569
Nine companions.

1163
01:45:27.404 --> 01:45:29.240
So be it.

1164
01:45:29.573 --> 01:45:32.576
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1165
01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:35.162
Great!

1166
01:45:35.246 --> 01:45:37.581
Where are we going?

1167
01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:09.600
♫ [Sindarin] <i>Estel, le iôn adar lín...</i> ♫

1168
01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:19.500

[English] She wanted to protect her child.

1170
01:46:24.433 --> 01:46:28.228
[Sindarin] <i>Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.</i>
[English] She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.

1171
01:46:30.648 --> 01:46:34.151
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1172
01:46:34.652 --> 01:46:36.320
That you'd never escape your fate.

1173
01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:40.491
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1174
01:46:40.908 --> 01:46:44.828
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1175
01:46:45.829 --> 01:46:48.332
I do not want that power.

1176
01:46:48.499 --> 01:46:51.168
I have never wanted it.

1177
01:46:52.503 --> 01:46:55.130
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1178
01:46:59.510 --> 01:47:01.845
BILBO:
My old sword! Sting.

1179
01:47:02.054 --> 01:47:03.180
Here, take it. Take it.

1180
01:47:08.686 --> 01:47:12.648
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1181
01:47:13.357 --> 01:47:17.444
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1182
01:47:17.653 --> 01:47:22.199
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1183
01:47:22.408 --> 01:47:24.868
Here's a pretty thing.

1184
01:47:25.285 --> 01:47:26.578
Mithril.

1185
01:47:27.371 --> 01:47:31.750
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1186
01:47:31.959 --> 01:47:35.212
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1187
01:47:38.757 --> 01:47:40.217
Oh!

1188
01:47:43.262 --> 01:47:45.305
My old ring.

1189
01:47:46.557 --> 01:47:50.477
I should very much like...

1190
01:47:50.728 --> 01:47:54.732
...to hold it again, one last time.

1191
01:48:12.082 --> 01:48:15.753
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1192
01:48:16.086 --> 01:48:20.215
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1193
01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:27.765
I'm sorry for everything.

1194
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:46.992
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1195
01:48:48.327 --> 01:48:50.954
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1196
01:48:51.163 --> 01:48:54.291
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1197
01:48:57.753 --> 01:49:00.297
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1198
01:49:00.756 --> 01:49:04.676
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1199
01:49:05.219 --> 01:49:07.805
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1200
01:49:10.891 --> 01:49:14.978
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1201
01:49:33.413 --> 01:49:35.916
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1202
01:49:36.458 --> 01:49:38.293
Left.

If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1212
01:51:25.317 --> 01:51:28.070
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1213
01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:31.615
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1214
01:51:32.282 --> 01:51:36.119
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1215
01:51:36.453 --> 01:51:41.833
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1216
01:51:51.051 --> 01:51:52.135
Sorry!

-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1222

It's moving fast.

1223
01:52:12.823 --> 01:52:14.992

01:52:15.784 --> 01:52:17.911
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!

-Hurry!
-Take cover!

Spies of Saruman.

1227
01:52:56.742 --> 01:53:00.037
The passage south is being watched.

1228
01:53:01.204 --> 01:53:04.541
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

Boromir.

1231
01:53:40.369 --> 01:53:44.581
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1232
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:47.918
...over so small a thing.

1233
01:53:51.129 --> 01:53:53.090
Such a little thing.

1234
01:53:53.298 --> 01:53:54.758
Boromir!

1235
01:53:55.384 --> 01:53:58.095
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1236
01:54:07.896 --> 01:54:09.940
As you wish.

1237
01:54:10.649 --> 01:54:12.651

So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

01:54:52.983 --> 01:54:57.571

It's Saruman!

Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1256
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:56.606
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1257
01:56:56.773 --> 01:57:00.527
GIMLI: We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1258
01:57:00.777 --> 01:57:03.613
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

<i>SARUMAN: Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.</i>

1267
01:57:46.197 --> 01:57:49.075
We will go through the mines.

1268
01:57:49.826 --> 01:57:51.703
So be it.

1269
01:57:58.335 --> 01:58:02.297
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1270
01:58:05.842 --> 01:58:08.011
How is your shoulder?

1271
01:58:08.219 --> 01:58:11.514
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?

1272
01:58:13.016 --> 01:58:15.518
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1273
01:58:16.019 --> 01:58:18.938
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1274
01:58:19.356 --> 01:58:23.276
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1275
01:58:23.443 --> 01:58:26.029
And, I fear, from within.

1276
01:58:28.698 --> 01:58:32.869
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourself.

1277
01:58:33.036 --> 01:58:35.872
Trust your own strengths.

1278
01:58:36.039 --> 01:58:38.625
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this world...

...for good or for evil.

1280
01:58:41.044 --> 01:58:43.380
Some are greater than I am.

1281
01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:47.550
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1282
01:58:48.885 --> 01:58:50.261
The walls...

1283
01:58:50.970 --> 01:58:53.056
...of Moria.

1284
01:58:58.770 --> 01:59:01.773
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1285
01:59:01.981 --> 01:59:06.403
GANDALF: Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1286
01:59:06.778 --> 01:59:09.280
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1287
01:59:17.288 --> 01:59:20.583
Well, let's see.

1288
01:59:20.792 --> 01:59:22.168
Ithildin.

1289
01:59:22.794 --> 01:59:26.172
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1290
01:59:40.228 --> 01:59:44.315
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1291
01:59:44.899 --> 01:59:49.529
-Speak, friend, and enter."
-What do you suppose that means?

1292
01:59:49.779 --> 01:59:54.534
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1293
01:59:55.076 --> 01:59:59.738
[Sindarin] <i>Annon Edhellen edro hi ammen!</i>

[English] Doorway of the Dwarf-folk listen, to the word of my tongue.

1295
02:00:18.308 --> 02:00:19.434
Nothing's happening.

1296
02:00:26.441 --> 02:00:30.653
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1297
02:00:30.987 --> 02:00:33.823
...Men and Orcs.

1298
02:00:34.073 --> 02:00:35.325
What are you going to do, then?

1299
02:00:35.492 --> 02:00:37.744
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1300
02:00:37.994 --> 02:00:39.996
And if that does not shatter them...

1301
02:00:40.163 --> 02:00:42.874
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1302
02:00:43.041 --> 02:00:46.503
...I will try to find the opening words.

1303
02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:52.300
[Quenya] <i>Ando Eldarinwa...</i>
[English] Gate of elves...

1306
02:00:59.349 --> 02:01:01.893
Mines are no place for a pony.

1307
02:01:02.101 --> 02:01:06.189
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.

1308
02:01:07.357 --> 02:01:10.193
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1309
02:01:10.693 --> 02:01:14.239
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1310
02:01:21.037 --> 02:01:23.623
Do not disturb the water.

1311
02:01:23.873 --> 02:01:25.708
Oh, it's useless.

1312
02:01:38.388 --> 02:01:40.557
It's a riddle.

1313
02:01:43.309 --> 02:01:46.437
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1314
02:01:46.813 --> 02:01:49.732
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1315
02:01:51.234 --> 02:01:52.527
[Sindarin] Mellon.
[English] Friend.

1316
02:02:10.587 --> 02:02:15.425
GIMLI: Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1317
02:02:15.925 --> 02:02:21.598
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1318
02:02:23.099 --> 02:02:26.185
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1319
02:02:26.561 --> 02:02:28.938
And they call it a mine.

1320
02:02:29.147 --> 02:02:31.107
A mine!

1321
02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:35.486

Lembas.

1665
02:48:11.261 --> 02:48:12.846
Elvish waybread.

1666
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:18.352
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1667
02:48:24.858 --> 02:48:26.818
How many did you eat?

1668
02:48:26.985 --> 02:48:28.654
<i>Four.</i>

CELEBORN: <i>Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.</i>

1671
02:48:37.245 --> 02:48:41.375
<i>Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.</i>

1672
02:48:41.541 --> 02:48:44.044
<i>Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.</i>

1673
02:48:44.252 --> 02:48:48.048
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1674
02:48:48.256 --> 02:48:53.345
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1675
02:49:01.820 --> 02:49:03.964

[English] You are being tracked.

By river you have the chance...

1677
02:49:07.442 --> 02:49:10.654
...of outrunning the enemy
to the Falls of Rauros.

1678
02:49:27.921 --> 02:49:32.759
GALADRIEL: My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1679
02:49:33.009 --> 02:49:36.513
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1680
02:49:41.893 --> 02:49:44.354
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1681
02:49:44.521 --> 02:49:48.525
They have already seen service in war.

1682
02:49:48.692 --> 02:49:50.944
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1683
02:49:51.111 --> 02:49:54.448
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1686
02:50:01.204 --> 02:50:03.331
Thank you, my lady.

1687
02:50:05.125 --> 02:50:08.462
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1688
02:50:14.926 --> 02:50:17.971
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1689
02:50:18.138 --> 02:50:20.265
Nothing.

1690
02:50:20.891 --> 02:50:24.227
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1691
02:50:24.853 --> 02:50:30.066
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1692
02:50:37.115 --> 02:50:38.658
Actually...

1693
02:50:38.867 --> 02:50:40.494
There was one thing.

1694
02:50:41.328 --> 02:50:43.997
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1695
02:50:44.164 --> 02:50:46.958
<i>Stupid to ask.</i>

02:51:07.581 --> 02:51:11.901
[Sindarin] <i>...Ad ae periatham athar i methid en-amar hen.</i>

[Sindarin] <i>Aníron i e círatha na Valinor.</i>
[English] I wish that she sails to Valinor.

1703
02:51:21.034 --> 02:51:24.120
[IN ENGLISH]
That choice is yet before her.

1704
02:51:24.704 --> 02:51:27.624
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1705
02:51:27.958 --> 02:51:33.797
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1706
02:51:33.964 --> 02:51:38.301
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

02:51:45.375 --> 02:51:46.410

I give you the light of Eärendil...

02:52:13.420 --> 02:52:15.755
...our most beloved star.

<i>May it be a light for you

<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

02:52:42.449 --> 02:52:45.619
GIMLI: I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1717
02:52:46.244 --> 02:52:50.540
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1718
02:52:51.291 --> 02:52:54.628
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1719
02:52:54.878 --> 02:52:56.796
What was her gift?

1720
02:52:57.005 --> 02:53:01.927
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1721
02:53:02.719 --> 02:53:05.597
She gave me three.

[BIRDS SQUAWKING]

1723
02:54:47.741 --> 02:54:51.202
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1724
02:54:54.914 --> 02:54:58.043
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1725
02:54:58.251 --> 02:55:01.421
But he's too clever a waterman.

1726
02:55:02.255 --> 02:55:05.592
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1727
02:55:05.759 --> 02:55:08.011
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1728
02:55:08.178 --> 02:55:10.263
SAM:
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1729
02:55:10.430 --> 02:55:13.516
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything all day.

1730
02:55:13.683 --> 02:55:16.770
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1731
02:55:17.729 --> 02:55:20.732
-Mr. Frodo--
-I'm all right.

1732
02:55:20.899 --> 02:55:22.067
But you're not.

1733
02:55:22.358 --> 02:55:24.861
I'm hereto help you.

1734
02:55:25.028 --> 02:55:26.738
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1735
02:55:32.702 --> 02:55:35.455
You can't help me, Sam.

1736
02:55:37.582 --> 02:55:39.292
Not this time.

1737
02:55:42.212 --> 02:55:44.297
Get some sleep.

1738
02:55:50.553 --> 02:55:52.764
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1739
02:55:53.306 --> 02:55:56.059
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1740
02:55:56.726 --> 02:55:58.978
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1741
02:55:59.312 --> 02:56:02.190
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1742
02:56:02.649 --> 02:56:04.651
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1743
02:56:06.486 --> 02:56:09.322
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1744
02:56:09.489 --> 02:56:12.492
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1745
02:56:12.700 --> 02:56:15.995
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1746
02:56:16.246 --> 02:56:18.456
But you will not see that.

1747
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:20.208
You are afraid!

1748
02:56:20.458 --> 02:56:23.002
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1749
02:56:23.294 --> 02:56:26.756
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1750
02:56:29.175 --> 02:56:33.513
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

02:56:53.533 --> 02:56:57.287
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

02:56:58.037 --> 02:56:59.956
My kin.

1755
02:58:18.952 --> 02:58:21.120
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1756
02:58:21.371 --> 02:58:23.957
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1757
02:58:24.123 --> 02:58:27.627
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

1758
02:58:28.044 --> 02:58:31.881
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1759
02:58:32.048 --> 02:58:35.301
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1760
02:58:35.468 --> 02:58:38.596
And after that, it gets even better.

1761
02:58:38.972 --> 02:58:43.935
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1762
02:58:44.102 --> 02:58:45.478
That is our road.

1763
02:58:47.063 --> 02:58:50.275
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1764
02:58:50.483 --> 02:58:52.235
Recover my--

1765
02:58:55.238 --> 02:58:57.240
-We should leave now.
-No.

1766
02:58:57.407 --> 02:59:01.869
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1767
02:59:02.078 --> 02:59:05.498
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1768
02:59:05.748 --> 02:59:09.752
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1769
02:59:10.253 --> 02:59:14.424
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1770
02:59:16.426 --> 02:59:21.389
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1771
02:59:21.889 --> 02:59:23.599
Where's Frodo?

1772
02:59:49.208 --> 02:59:51.127
BOROMIR:
None of us should wander alone.

1773
02:59:52.545 --> 02:59:54.630
You, least of all.

1774
02:59:54.839 --> 02:59:57.300
So much depends on you.

1775
02:59:58.343 --> 03:00:00.303
Frodo?

1776
03:00:07.435 --> 03:00:09.979
I know why you seek solitude.

1777
03:00:10.688 --> 03:00:14.150
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1778
03:00:14.942 --> 03:00:17.987
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1779
03:00:19.572 --> 03:00:22.200
There are other ways, Frodo.

1780
03:00:22.450 --> 03:00:26.245
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

1781
03:00:26.496 --> 03:00:30.249
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1782
03:00:30.500 --> 03:00:33.586
Warning? Against what?

1783
03:00:33.753 --> 03:00:35.880
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1784
03:00:36.089 --> 03:00:39.717
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1785
03:00:39.967 --> 03:00:43.721
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

1786
03:00:45.515 --> 03:00:48.851
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1787
03:00:50.395 --> 03:00:52.480
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

1788
03:00:53.689 --> 03:00:57.360
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

1789
03:00:59.195 --> 03:01:02.532
What chance do you think you have?

1790
03:01:02.698 --> 03:01:07.370
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1791
03:01:07.620 --> 03:01:11.290
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1792
03:01:13.418 --> 03:01:15.545
You fool!

1793
03:01:15.711 --> 03:01:19.715
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1794
03:01:19.882 --> 03:01:22.718
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1795
03:01:22.885 --> 03:01:24.220
-Give it to me!
-No!

1796
03:01:24.387 --> 03:01:26.222
-Give it to me!
-No.

1797
03:01:33.896 --> 03:01:35.898
I see your mind.

1798
03:01:36.149 --> 03:01:39.068
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1799
03:01:39.277 --> 03:01:41.154
You will betray us!

1800
03:01:41.404 --> 03:01:44.574
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1801
03:01:45.032 --> 03:01:48.661
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1802
03:01:55.751 --> 03:01:57.253
Frodo?

1803
03:02:01.591 --> 03:02:03.176
Frodo.

1804
03:02:07.096 --> 03:02:09.098
What have I done?

1805
03:02:09.307 --> 03:02:11.058
Please, Frodo.

1806
03:02:11.267 --> 03:02:13.936
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1807
03:02:14.145 --> 03:02:16.022

03:03:02.485 --> 03:03:03.903
Frodo?

1812
03:03:05.154 --> 03:03:08.241
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?

1813
03:03:08.491 --> 03:03:10.243
Stay away!

1814
03:03:10.660 --> 03:03:12.245
Frodo!

1815
03:03:14.497 --> 03:03:18.334
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?

1816
03:03:28.010 --> 03:03:30.513
Would you destroy it?

<i>Elessar.</i>

1820
03:03:54.537 --> 03:03:57.873
I would have gone with you to the end.

1821
03:03:58.541 --> 03:04:01.377
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1822
03:04:04.714 --> 03:04:05.881
I know.

1823
03:04:08.384 --> 03:04:13.806
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1824
03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:19.312
Go, Frodo!

1825
03:04:22.315 --> 03:04:23.816
Run.

1826
03:04:24.066 --> 03:04:25.735
Run!

1827
03:04:50.259 --> 03:04:51.927
Mr. Frodo!

03:05:01.228 --> 03:05:02.980
Find the halfling!

03:05:04.607 --> 03:05:07.151
Find the halfling!

1830
03:05:10.613 --> 03:05:12.281
Elendil!

1831
03:05:18.788 --> 03:05:20.373
Aragorn, go!

1832
03:05:42.061 --> 03:05:43.396
PIPPIN:
Frodo!

1833
03:05:43.979 --> 03:05:45.564
Hide here. Quick!

1834
03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:47.650
Come on!

1835
03:05:50.152 --> 03:05:52.154
What's he doing?

1836
03:05:56.409 --> 03:05:58.411
He's leaving.

1837
03:06:03.165 --> 03:06:06.085
No!
Pippin!

1838
03:06:11.006 --> 03:06:13.342
MERRY:
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1839
03:06:13.926 --> 03:06:17.012
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!

1840
03:06:17.430 --> 03:06:19.014
-Over here!
-This way!

1841
03:06:29.859 --> 03:06:32.194
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

1842
03:07:25.664 --> 03:07:27.291
[HORN BLOWS]

1843
03:07:27.583 --> 03:07:30.628
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

1844
03:08:13.712 --> 03:08:14.839
Run!

1845
03:09:51.602 --> 03:09:54.021
[ARROW HITS]

1846
03:11:46.425 --> 03:11:48.052
No.

1847
03:11:51.889 --> 03:11:54.933
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.

1848
03:11:55.267 --> 03:11:57.352
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1849
03:11:59.229 --> 03:12:00.647
I let Frodo go.

1850
03:12:01.356 --> 03:12:03.942
Then you did what I could not.

1851
03:12:04.943 --> 03:12:08.280
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1852
03:12:08.781 --> 03:12:13.077
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

1853
03:12:13.285 --> 03:12:15.579
I did not see it.

1854
03:12:15.788 --> 03:12:18.957
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

1855
03:12:19.416 --> 03:12:21.960
You fought bravely.

1856
03:12:22.252 --> 03:12:24.922
You have kept your honor.

1857
03:12:25.464 --> 03:12:27.424
BOROMIR:
Leave it.

1858
03:12:27.758 --> 03:12:29.802
It is over.

1859
03:12:30.969 --> 03:12:36.266
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1860
03:12:36.683 --> 03:12:39.686
...and my city to ruin.

1861
03:12:43.774 --> 03:12:46.485
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1862
03:12:46.652 --> 03:12:50.656
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1863
03:12:51.657 --> 03:12:54.159
...nor our people fail.

1864
03:12:55.160 --> 03:12:56.495
Our people.

1865
03:13:00.332 --> 03:13:02.459
Our people.

1866
03:13:24.189 --> 03:13:27.192
I would have followed you, my brother.

1867
03:13:28.735 --> 03:13:30.737
My captain.

1868
03:13:33.365 --> 03:13:35.325
<i>My king.</i>

1869
03:13:54.970 --> 03:13:57.222
Be at peace...

1870
03:13:57.556 --> 03:13:59.558
...son of Gondor.

1871
03:14:16.074 --> 03:14:19.411
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1872
03:14:19.912 --> 03:14:22.915
But he will not return.

1873
03:14:46.104 --> 03:14:48.106
Frodo!

1874
03:15:07.584 --> 03:15:10.837
<i>FRODO:
I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1875
03:15:12.130 --> 03:15:15.133
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1876
03:15:18.095 --> 03:15:20.847
<i>GANDALF: So do all who live
to see such times...</i>

1877
03:15:21.056 --> 03:15:24.476
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1878
03:15:24.643 --> 03:15:27.312
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1879
03:15:27.562 --> 03:15:32.317
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1880
03:16:01.138 --> 03:16:03.181
Frodo, no!

1881
03:16:03.682 --> 03:16:05.017
Frodo!

1882
03:16:05.851 --> 03:16:08.520
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

1883
03:16:12.024 --> 03:16:14.026
Go back, Sam!

1884
03:16:14.526 --> 03:16:18.113
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

1885
03:16:18.322 --> 03:16:21.158
And I'm coming with you!

1886
03:16:21.616 --> 03:16:24.036
You can't swim!

1887
03:16:27.831 --> 03:16:29.541
Sam!

1888
03:16:35.130 --> 03:16:36.423
Sam!

1889
03:17:17.381 --> 03:17:20.092
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1890
03:17:20.425 --> 03:17:24.763
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1891
03:17:25.889 --> 03:17:28.475
And I don't mean to.

1892
03:17:28.767 --> 03:17:30.936
I don't mean to.

1893
03:17:32.604 --> 03:17:34.439
Sam.

1894
03:17:49.287 --> 03:17:50.956
Come on.

1895
03:18:19.443 --> 03:18:23.989
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1896
03:18:38.837 --> 03:18:43.842
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1897
03:18:47.304 --> 03:18:52.184
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1898
03:19:04.029 --> 03:19:07.199
Not if we hold true to each other.

1899
03:19:08.533 --> 03:19:13.038
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1900
03:19:14.039 --> 03:19:19.294
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1901
03:19:20.545 --> 03:19:22.589
We travel light.

1902
03:19:22.797 --> 03:19:24.716
Let us hunt some Orc.

1903
03:19:27.677 --> 03:19:29.721
Yes!

1904
03:19:48.698 --> 03:19:50.116
FRODO:
Mordor.

1905
03:19:50.742 --> 03:19:54.120
I hope the others find a safer road.

1906
03:19:55.080 --> 03:19:57.624
Strider will look after them.

1907
03:19:58.583 --> 03:20:01.920
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1908
03:20:02.254 --> 03:20:04.714
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1909
03:20:04.923 --> 03:20:06.424
We may.

1910
03:20:08.552 --> 03:20:09.594
Sam...

1911
03:20:13.223 --> 03:20:15.850
...I'm glad you are with me.
