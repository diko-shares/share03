00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,790
So, are you saying that you don't want me

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,100
to meet a man who is better off than your husband?

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,770
So, it's only fair if I meet someone worse than your husband?

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,240
Of course!

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,170
That is the law of the universe.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,010
The order of the world.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,410
I'm going.

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,790
Law of the universe? Order of the world?

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,130
Honey!

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,530
Oh, Ah Jung!

11
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,460
Whenever I ignore my brain and act impulsively,

12
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,130
there's always trouble.

13
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,370
Honey, I'm here.

14
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,920
Sister-in-law, you've come just in time.

15
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,730
What have I just done?

16
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,500
Oh! Stomach, my stomach!

17
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,970
Honey.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,540
Hold on...

19
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,820
Why don't you say that again?

20
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,600
Mr. Hyun Gi Joon, what I'm saying is...

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,630
What?  Honey?

22
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,100
Mr. Hyun Gi Joon,

23
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,940
It's a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding!

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,510
A misunderstanding?

25
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,710
I didn't mean to...

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,910
I'm sorry. Unknowingly, I'd already...

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,850
Ah Jung, I'll see you next time.

28
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,050
So Ran,  let's go together!

29
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,250
Hey, hey!

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,550
I'll take you.  Are you alright?

31
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,020
Hey!

32
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,220
Hey, brother. What's wrong with you?

33
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,790
What are you doing?

34
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,900
It's a lover's spat.

35
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,100
No, it's not what you're all thinking!  It's not like that!

36
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,480
You're having stomach pains?

37
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,120
Please?

38
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,580
Driving me crazy.

39
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,960
Honey, are you okay?

40
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm coming.

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,730
I'm fine.  Leave me alone!

42
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,200
Hey!  Hey!  Hey!

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,670
Honey, quickly, get in the car!

44
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,500
Oh...  I know already.

45
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,810
Thank you for the help.

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,720
Even if you're going down, you'll be doing it in a grand style.

47
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,960
Fine, you're Yoo So Ran and I'm just Gong Ah Jung.  You're so great!

48
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,630
"Just quickly leave, Honey!"

49
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,930
You... are you alright?

50
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,500
I am fine, still haven't gone crazy yet.

51
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,600
Should I call a taxi for you?

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
There's no need.  I came here by car.

53
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,470
Oh right, what am I doing here?

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,550
What happened exactly?

55
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,950
-= Episode 3 =-

56
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,570
Where is he?

57
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,140
He said he'll be outside working the whole day.

58
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,080
Out? Where?

59
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,010
I can't tell you.

60
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,680
Tell him that if he still wants his position, he should hurry back.

61
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,150
Hurry!

62
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,620
Yes.

63
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,120
So,

64
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,690
you were so scared by her words that you ran all the way here?

65
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,260
Hey, doesn't the chairman always mean what she says?

66
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,200
What should I say if I go down right now?

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,770
That there's a crazy woman who is going around spreading nonsense,

68
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,170
and I know nothing about it, despite it happening in my own hotel?

69
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,010
That I just stupidly watched her

70
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,040
confirm all those rumors?

71
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,350
And that right now, my insides are in turmoil

72
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,650
and I'm about to go crazy pretending that nothing is going on?

73
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,490
Should I explain it to her this way?

74
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,790
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

75
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,090
It was my fault for suggesting that you work things out with her,

76
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,190
before the chairman does.

77
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,930
Alright.

78
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,130
Tell her that I will see her tomorrow.

79
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,970
But...

80
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,640
should we try talking to Gong Ah Jung again?

81
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,040
That woman is making me look like a fool!

82
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,440
I'll make her regret it.

83
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,380
But still, I feel bad for Gong Ah Jung.

84
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,480
Park Hoon.

85
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,220
No matter what,

86
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,680
we can't let the chairman find out about this matter, right?

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,990
Do you think the chairman will ignore it?

88
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,290
Now, Gong Ah Jung is really in deep trouble.

89
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,060
If the chairman becomes aware of the rumor,

90
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,470
she might go crazy, just like last time.

91
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,200
Don't exaggerate.

92
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,140
I'm definitely not exaggerating and you know that.

93
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,550
How did it work?

94
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,490
The Chairman said he will see you to talk about what happened yesterday.

95
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,690
You've come.

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,770
Why is everyone saying that you're already married?

97
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,870
It's just a rumor.

98
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,600
A rumor?

99
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,170
My friends just misunderstood it.

100
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,110
How dare they joke about someone like you!

101
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,510
Who is it? Isn't that woman called Ah Jung?

102
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,080
How do you know her name?

103
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,180
The last time I checked, this place wasn't a rumor mill.

104
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,020
You can still joke about it at a time like this?

105
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,050
Gong Ah Jung is also a victim.

106
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,520
Victim?

107
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,090
I heard she was at your party yesterday.

108
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,930
It is a rumor mill, after all.

109
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,390
You're misunderstanding things.

110
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,860
You're just covering up for this woman, aren't you?

111
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,430
I'm not covering up anything. It's the truth.

112
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,530
That Gong Ah Jung,

113
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,840
with the rumor about me getting married floating around, it must be good for her.

114
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,040
It's not that big, so don't worry about it.

115
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,140
It's just an accident.

116
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,610
Then, what's your relationship with that woman?

117
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,810
No one reported that to you?

118
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,380
There is no relationship of any kind at all.

119
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,580
If there isn't,  why are you so agitated?

120
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,050
You think I don't know you?

121
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,560
Chairman... No, Aunt. This is my personal affair.

122
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,290
So?

123
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,230
I'll handle my personal affairs myself.

124
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,400
Since you say you can resolve this,

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,070
then see to it.

126
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,010
Sorry for troubling you.

127
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,940
Don't let people go around talking behind your back.

128
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,250
No matter what, you are the company's image.

129
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,720
Yes.

130
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,520
I'm just asking on the off chance...

131
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,830
You're not the one making up these rumors, are you?

132
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,560
What?

133
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,030
Because I keep telling you to get married,

134
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,600
are you resorting to this petty trick to avoid the matchmaking sessions?

135
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,170
You watch too many dramas.

136
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,270
Is it that obvious?

137
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,470
Don't let other people find out.

138
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,880
No matter what, the president represents our company's image.

139
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,910
So, you really don't have any relationship, whatsoever?

140
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:27,890
Aunt, please take care.

141
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,560
How did it go?

142
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,590
Get me an appointment with that lawyer immediately.

143
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,470
Are you absolutely sure that he's the best?

144
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,870
Aren't all lawyers the same?

145
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,540
But, do you really want to litigate?

146
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,210
There's no reason not to do that now, is there?

147
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,190
I'm going up first. Come after you have parked the car.

148
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,650
Yes.

149
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,440
Is something wrong?

150
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,840
Excuse me... aren't you Ah Jung's husband?

151
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,780
That's right.  Don't you remember me?

152
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,610
Yesterday, at the hotel.

153
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,320
Nice to meet you. I'm Chun Jae Bum.

154
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,620
Chun Jae Bum.

155
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,600
Looks like Ah Jung didn't mention anything about me to you, huh?

156
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,900
Yes, looks like the two of you have a very close relationship.

157
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,940
Of course, we've even lived together before.

158
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,750
Ah, we used to live in the same dorm.

159
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,420
Haha, looks like you were really surprised.

160
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,120
But, what are you doing here?

161
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,790
Do you need a lawyer?

162
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,260
No.

163
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,100
Is that so?

164
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,440
Aren't you getting on?

165
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,910
Let me make this clear.

166
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,940
I'm not Gong Ah Jung's husband.

167
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,780
=The elevator door is closing.=

168
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,750
What does he mean, not Ah Jung's husband?

169
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:49,560
Then... aha, really! Then, Mrs.?

170
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,400
He doesn't want me to call Ah Jung by her name!

171
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,230
He wants me to call her Mrs.!

172
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,430
Ah... seriously!

173
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,040
Mrs. Ah Jung.

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,080
What's wrong? Wasn't he available?

175
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,550
Find me another lawyer.

176
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,480
Chun Jae Bum told me that he has a close relationship with Gong Ah Jung.

177
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,420
What? He's close to Gong Ah Jung?

178
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,090
Look at what kind of lawyer you've picked. Did you even look into it seriously?

179
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,390
That... I'll look for a new one immediately.

180
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,060
Almost got a cat to look after the fish.

181
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,370
I thought it was suspicious, the way she confidently asked me to show some evidence.

182
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,300
It could even be that the lawyer is guiding her through all of this.

183
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
Don't tell me... those two are in it together?!

184
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,970
It's definitely suspicious.

185
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,640
President, should we report it to the police?

186
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,110
Get the police involved in it?

187
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,730
Are you Gong Ah Jung?

188
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,030
Yes.  What's wrong?

189
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,540
- You're under arrest on charges of marriage fraud.
- No!

190
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,840
- If you have anything to say, convey it through your lawyer.
- No!

191
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,580
No!

192
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,980
I was wronged! Save me, save me! I really didn't!

193
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,810
I really didn't!  Ajussi, ajussi!
(Ajussi - Older man, uncle)

194
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,950
I was wronged! I really didn't, I didn't! Save me!

195
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,740
Your eyes look like they're emitting laser beams.

196
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,870
Is the budgeting done,

197
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,080
Affairs Officer?

198
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,380
Were you thinking about something erotic just now?

199
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,110
What?

200
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,680
Although I can't comment on people's private lives,

201
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,250
the way you're looking at the handcuffs so intently,

202
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,720
it's a bit...

203
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,760
Why don't you suffer some beatings? With a belt.

204
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,230
Why?

205
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,970
Why is it so quiet?

206
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,170
Not a single call all day.

207
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,740
Normally, it would be so chaotic.

208
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,050
I get more restless when it's this quiet!

209
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,220
Hello, yes, yes.

210
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,460
Affairs Officer, Affairs Officer!

211
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,400
There's someone waiting for you downstairs.

212
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,070
He finally came.

213
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,210
He said he's your husband.

214
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,050
Then, I'll be getting off work first.

215
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,760
Husband?  Really?

216
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,230
Husband.

217
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,330
Yes, right.

218
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,160
When did she get a husband?

219
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
Jackpot!

220
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,640
What should I do...?

221
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,030
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

222
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,310
This is so sudden, what should I say?

223
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,660
He's not here.

224
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,960
Who are you looking for?

225
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,640
It's you!

226
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,940
Are you happy or disappointed?

227
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,610
What?  Husband, husband.

228
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,810
Saying I'm your friend sounds tacky.

229
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,280
Friend?

230
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,480
Would it be better if I said I was your younger brother?

231
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,060
You sort it out.

232
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,630
I'm her younger brother.

233
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,470
Yes.

234
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,870
So... He's not, right?

235
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,810
Of course. Where would she get a husband?

236
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,110
How desperate she must have been!

237
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,020
You like this kind of thing?

238
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,590
Right, I bought a cell phone.

239
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,060
Save my number, okay?

240
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,900
If only I had a phone, then we wouldn't have lost each other yesterday.

241
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,940
You're so shameless! How can you blame it on the cellphone?

242
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,140
You can vent on me while you eat.

243
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:38,240
You wait and see.

244
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,280
But, was the person you said you were going to dump, Hyun Gi Joon?

245
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,950
Why do you care? You said you'd help me, but you ran away.

246
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:51,820
No, it's not like that... I'm just worried.

247
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,230
I went to put out the fire, but ended up adding fuel to it instead.

248
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,000
I was just there but the timing wasn't right...

249
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,470
Hyun Gi Joon.

250
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,040
He must be thinking that I'm a very strange woman.

251
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,870
It does look kind of deliberate.

252
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,710
He's definitely very angry, right?

253
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,910
It is hard to think of it as a joke.

254
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,850
It doesn't look like it, but he's really good at pretending to be refined.

255
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,150
I know him a bit.

256
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,720
What? Are you going to lie and tell me that you're his younger brother?

257
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,660
It will be believable since you share the same surname.

258
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,860
You don't buy it, huh?

259
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,960
I need to migrate!

260
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,730
Just apologize, acknowledge your mistake, and sort things out properly.

261
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,670
It's not like he can kill a person who's apologizing to him.

262
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,070
I ain't joking. Apparently the whole of Korea's fate rests on this one businessman.

263
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,010
That's hard to say.

264
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,150
Hey, either you joke or you comfort me. Don't make me anxious by doing both!

265
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,620
What is it?

266
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,090
Lower your voice.

267
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,030
Ah Jung!

268
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,230
Recently, we keep bumping into each other, huh?

269
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,270
Is So Ran okay?

270
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,840
It's just stomach cramps due to stress.

271
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,410
It will get better with a few days of treatment.

272
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,610
She's been quite busy preparing to go abroad.

273
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,710
Is she going somewhere?

274
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,480
She's going to Canada to continue her studies.

275
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,580
She's going alone?

276
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,990
This is a macaroon, right? Is it tasty?

277
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,460
Yeah

278
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,660
I should buy some macaroons for her.

279
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,760
For So Ran?

280
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:41,570
Yeah, she keeps saying she's in pain. So, I thought I should buy this for her.

281
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,440
Oh, right. I bumped into your husband.

282
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,410
Ah, really?

283
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,020
Did he say anything?

284
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,530
I addressed you by your name and he seemed angry with that.

285
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,200
It would be strange to call you Madam, right?

286
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,170
So Ran is going abroad next month.

287
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,210
We should go for a couples date before she leaves.

288
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,240
Um, we'll see when the time comes.

289
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,480
Wait a moment.

290
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,560
"When the time comes?" What are you trying to do here?

291
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,030
I don't know.

292
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,510
They're gone?

293
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,440
They didn't even say goodbye.

294
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,280
Drink up!

295
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,150
The more I think about it, the more I feel she is to be pitied.

296
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,820
How desperate must she have been to resort to having her brother pose as her husband?

297
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,760
Does Officer Gong have a brother?

298
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,330
Hasn't she already said that it's a cousin?

299
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,900
Praise her and she gets all pompous.

300
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,100
It's really pathetic!

301
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,670
To be honest, a career isn't everything to a woman, isn't that right?

302
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,440
You're still bearing a grudge from that sightseeing incident?

303
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,490
Do I look like someone who would hold a grudge against subordinates?

304
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:29,840
Do I look like someone who would hold a grudge against subordinates?

305
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,390
Yes.

306
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,250
- How can it be?
- No, no.

307
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,450
No? Sunbae you're all...

308
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,490
I'll be honest, I don't hate Gong Ah Jung.

309
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,790
The problem is the personnel selection that simply selects, it's not Gong Ah Jung's fault!

310
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,730
It's not a crime to not know your own capabilities.

311
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,130
But, Officer Gong's level is not too bad, isn't it?

312
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,530
Not bad? It's bad enough to refer to her brother as her husband.

313
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,000
It seems to be a joke!

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,670
This kind of joke exposes her inner fears.

315
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,320
Aren't you leaving?

316
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,620
You could get kidnapped by bad people.

317
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:23,430
I stayed in that examination hall for two whole years.

318
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,770
It must have been hard, huh?

319
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,810
No, I felt very happy,

320
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,780
because I was together with the person I liked.

321
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,190
Because I really, really liked that person,

322
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,750
I wanted him to see my good side.

323
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,960
But I didn't know how.

324
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,260
So I decided,

325
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,830
that I would confess to him when the examination results came out.

326
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,500
But something happened...

327
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,230
And then?

328
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:08,570
On that day, I saw him with another woman.

329
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,880
Funny?

330
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,710
Isn't that interesting?!

331
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,020
He's the person we just met, right?

332
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,320
Aren't I very silly?

333
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,790
Why take the test?

334
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,260
I shouldn't have taken that test...

335
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,460
I should have gone for plastic surgery or something, right?

336
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,660
Taking an exam for the sake of love

337
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,330
seems like something you would do.

338
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,900
We've only known each other for a few days.

339
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,100
Is it that important for two people to spend time together?

340
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,140
You could be together for a lifetime and still be unable to understand each other.

341
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,440
I'm quite envious of that person.

342
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,110
Why hasn't a woman ever tried to pass a test for me?

343
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:54,090
I'm a very persistent woman, you know.

344
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,110
Ah, it's really nice here.

345
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,680
I feel a bit cold.

346
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,300
I'll leave first.

347
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,000
Buy me a cup of coffee, okay?

348
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,840
I feel like having a cup of coffee.

349
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,240
Miss, please buy me some coffee.

350
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:50,980
What happened?  What happened?

351
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,180
I'll give this to you if you buy me a cup of coffee, okay?

352
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,280
Hyung!

353
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,850
Those cheapskates!

354
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,790
Can't you even buy me a cup of coffee?!

355
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,760
Stop running!  I'm tired!

356
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,160
We should have just bought him some coffee. Why did you run?

357
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,100
I was scared because I didn't have any change.

358
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,300
Ah, really!

359
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,770
Where's your house?

360
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,170
Over there, just five minutes away.

361
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,910
Hold on, I'm really exhausted.

362
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,840
Usually, students who live in the school,

363
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,680
must leave their luggage there, right?

364
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,520
That way, they can live properly.

365
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,450
On the Register of Names of Republic of South Korea,

366
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,120
there is only one person whose residence is in Shimlin-dong.

367
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,590
It's my dad.

368
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,890
Oh, ajusshi is really tenacious huh?

369
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,100
Hey, I'm really exhausted.

370
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,930
Let's go.  I'm going back home.

371
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,230
Do you need me to go with you, in case anything else happens?

372
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,800
Buy me a cup of coffee, okay?

373
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,740
Well, you are really scary.

374
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,840
I'm leaving.

375
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,310
My legs!

376
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,650
I'm so dead tired.

377
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,560
Mister.

378
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,290
Yes?

379
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,760
What day is it today?

380
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,060
Today? The 16th.

381
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,370
Looks like I forgot.

382
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,200
Are you busy?

383
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,040
Is it an important day?

384
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,670
It's been a long time since I've been here.

385
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:04,580
How's your life, Oh Yoon Joo?

386
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,850
Thank you! I forgot it's my birthday today.

387
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,890
Yoon Joo, do you really have to leave?

388
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,720
Can't you stay here forever?

389
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,490
I've already been here for three years.  It's time to return.

390
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,430
Furthermore, the conditions are very good.  It will be a pity to reject it.

391
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,730
Oh. That's too bad, then.

392
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,570
Should we have a party?

393
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,040
A party? Together with our friends?

394
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,610
Hmm...

395
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,980
These are your Li Cultural Experience Group documents.

396
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,920
Are you planning to travel?

397
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,760
No.

398
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,790
Right now, I really want to drop everything and just leave the country.

399
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,260
What's wrong?

400
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,230
It's obvious he's angry, but why is it so quiet?

401
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,010
I'm talking about guys. Is it intentional?

402
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,210
Is your husband like this too?

403
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,090
This...  I'm not too sure. Usually he's busy, I guess.

404
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,350
Busy. This... I'm not too sure.  Is he busy?

405
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,330
Busy.

406
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,850
Right!  This is it!

407
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,160
He's a leading businessman of South Korea.  Of course, he's busy.

408
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,360
How come I didn't think of that?

409
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,030
What happened?

410
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,960
Everything's solved.

411
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,630
I found the answer. I was just wasting my time worrying.

412
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,140
Anyway, it seems you solved it because of me,
so treat me to a cup of coffee, okay?

413
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,610
Sure.

414
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,280
Chief Executive's looking for you.  He wants you downstairs now.

415
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,380
Why?

416
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,480
I don't know.

417
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,950
Oh, okay.

418
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,820
What happened to you?

419
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,860
Because of the cultural event last time,

420
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,690
you are feeling very embarrassed, correct?

421
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:40,570
The Department of Culture has wronged you by saying your negligence caused the accident.

422
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,700
So, I said it can't be simply settled like this.
I insist on treating you for lunch.

423
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,540
Let's have something expensive, okay?

424
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,740
Where are we going to eat?

425
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,580
World Hotel.

426
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,780
What's wrong?

427
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,450
It's nothing.

428
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,590
Why THERE of all places?

429
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,520
This can't be.  I must think of a plan.

430
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,930
What do I do if he sees me?

431
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,880
What happened to you?

432
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,610
It's nothing.

433
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,190
It should be okay, right?

434
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,300
Affairs Officer Gong Ah Jung.

435
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,770
Huh...?

436
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:12,690
The minister said that you even had to write a letter of apology because of us.

437
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,890
So treat this meal as our apology. We're really sorry.

438
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,560
Don't mention it. Thank you for your kindness.

439
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,130
Go ahead, eat.

440
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,980
Are you okay?

441
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,190
I can't even have my meal in peace.

442
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,010
Could you hold on for a minute, please?

443
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,680
Let's talk a bit...

444
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,250
Just for a while.

445
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,080
What brings you here?

446
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,020
Just a quick talk, there are too many people here.

447
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,060
Just a while.

448
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,260
Remove your hand and we'll talk.

449
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:17,120
Are you intent on destroying me?

450
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,050
I wanted to apologize to you.

451
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:25,190
I'm really sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

452
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,660
You didn't do it on purpose?

453
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,490
Right, absolutely not.

454
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,160
I previously told my friend that I got married.

455
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,730
That day, because of her, it was a spur of the moment thing.

456
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,040
Gong Ah Jung, I don't care about your personal problems.

457
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,870
You must think I'm weird.

458
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,970
Why should that matter to you?

459
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,740
It does, at least I don't want you to misunderstand.

460
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,780
Please give me one more chance.  I'll explain properly.

461
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,120
No need, don't worry about it.

462
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,260
So, you mean you're not angry anymore?

463
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,440
What was that?

464
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,940
Don't thank me, I haven't started yet.

465
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,250
Your intuition is correct. Ah Jung's husband is not Hyun Gi Joon.

466
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,920
I asked the staff.  Although they didn't say, it feels like it isn't.

467
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,850
No, she married Hyun Gi Joon.

468
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,050
What? Really? How do you know?

469
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,260
I saw them together.

470
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,090
Things have been simply reversed!

471
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,390
Double reverse!

472
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,960
But, why does everyone say so?

473
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,800
It's certainly because of the chairman.

474
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,000
Does she oppose Ah Jung? Why?

475
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,240
What is Ah Jung in the eyes of the rich? So Ran isn't.

476
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,340
I'm a bit tired.

477
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,220
Okay, you'd better rest. Let's go.

478
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,050
Why? Didn't we just get here?

479
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,990
Hurry, get up!

480
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,530
I can understand So Ran's feelings. Even I'm jealous.

481
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,360
Furthermore, it's So Ran.

482
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,930
Is So Ran sick because of Ah Jung?

483
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:20,810
No, Ah Jung is starting to make me regret my whole life.

484
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,910
Why?

485
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,840
Don't you know that you're really annoying?

486
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,680
Tell me, I am very curious.

487
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,620
Really, in the future, I'm not going anywhere with you.

488
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,740
I was passing by, so I came to visit.

489
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,570
It's okay.

490
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,040
Waffles.

491
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,510
Are you mad at me?

492
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,350
I have no appetite right now.

493
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,550
Didn't you say you wanted to take a sniff?

494
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,280
Says who?

495
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,150
Sunbae... your husband said so... we met when buying this.

496
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,090
I thought he bought this for you.

497
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,330
I just mentioned it.  I really don't dare to talk too him much.

498
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,800
Give it to me.

499
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:24,300
Your wish must have been fulfilled.

500
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,070
Didn't you want to eat waffles together with Jae Bum?

501
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,280
It's all in the past.

502
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,210
How did you meet?

503
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,780
We just met there coincidentally.

504
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,620
I'm talking about your husband.

505
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,660
Yeah, it was really a coincidence.

506
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,790
Meeting Hyun Gi Joon coincidentally, you sure are lucky!

507
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,570
So Ran, I... honestly...

508
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,600
Right. Gong Ah Jung, tell her honestly that you're not married.

509
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,070
I'm actually...

510
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,640
Lying, right? Isn't that right?

511
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,940
You lied and told Hyun Gi Joon that you're pregnant, didn't you?

512
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,780
This girl is really bad.

513
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,080
Otherwise, how could you marry Hyun Gi Joon?

514
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:17,160
So Ran, I heard you want to study abroad. I heard it from sunbae.

515
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,730
Omo, you guys haven't met in a long time
and both of you are already talking about me?

516
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,500
No.  I asked about you, and he told me.

517
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,430
You're so funny. What are you expecting, exactly?

518
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,740
What are you planning to do to my husband while I'm not around?

519
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,200
I'm simply speechless.

520
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,770
No. Then, why did you buy that, to infuriate me?

521
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,880
Infuriate you?

522
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,440
Don't tell me you're really worried about me?

523
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,480
It's exactly that kind of behavior that makes people want to rebuke you.

524
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,520
Don't you know that all the women in Korea want your husband?

525
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,460
I'm glad if I misunderstood.

526
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,860
Don't blame me in the future because I'm not good enough for Jae Bum.

527
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:00,470
Of course, you are Jae Bum's wife from the beginning. Whereas, I am...

528
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,710
The way I see it, the matter is not related.

529
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,380
Look at me.  Haven't I found my other half?

530
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,410
Seems like those laws of the universe have finally been reversed.

531
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:19,180
Everything's useless, right?

532
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,290
Aren't you busy?

533
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,860
Hmm... I'm not that busy.

534
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,420
Why am I idling around like this?

535
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,400
What is this feeling?

536
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:43,410
This is really good. I'll finish this before I leave.

537
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,710
I have to go. Have a good rest.

538
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,550
I am leaving first.

539
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,750
Ah, really...

540
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,860
This type of feeling is a first for me!

541
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,800
It's raining. Did you bring an umbrella?

542
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,640
Of course I'm prepared.

543
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,110
Where's Suk Bong?

544
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,410
Sang Hee will bring it to me.

545
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,880
Placing it here will do.

546
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,980
What's this?

547
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,180
Somebody I know asked me to promote the sauna for him.

548
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,650
Is it okay to put it here?

549
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,490
An 80% discount coupon!

550
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,320
President, you should take a few!

551
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,160
No.  I'll pass this time.

552
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,990
You don't like going to the sauna?

553
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:09,660
Uh... Actually, I've never been to one.

554
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,970
Really? There can't possibly be someone who hasn't been to a sauna!

555
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,530
Anyway, there's no one to go with.

556
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,740
Do you want to go together?

557
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,040
I'm saying, it's really fun there.

558
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,140
After going once,

559
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,080
you can go there alone without worries.  Go, just go.

560
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,280
Okay, if I have time.

561
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,110
No need. Let's just go today.

562
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,850
Today?

563
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,580
A rainy day like this,

564
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,150
it's best to go there to warm up the body.

565
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,620
Do you want to go?

566
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,020
Afraid of spoiling the ambiance, afraid of spoiling the ambiance.

567
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,590
Why should I go there?

568
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,800
Talking about what ambiance?

569
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,100
If not, call Sang Hee and tell him to come.

570
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,930
Sure, it should be fun.

571
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,140
It'll be fun. I'll give him a call now.

572
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,710
Welco...

573
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,640
Not closed yet?

574
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,580
Haven't you said that you've got something on with those research students?

575
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,150
I just let them play amongst themselves.  I left by myself.

576
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,650
That...  Do you want to have some udon with me?

577
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,120
We'll go catch a movie after that.

578
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,890
What's wrong?

579
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,830
Okay, let's go.

580
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,300
Come out.

581
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,330
Sorry. We'll talk about it next time.

582
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:29,310
? <i> Not everybody can romance. </i> ?

583
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:32,240
? <i> Do you think that being in a relationship is easy? </i> ?

584
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,750
Stop singing, stop singing.

585
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,430
I haven't watched a late night movie in a long time.

586
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh right, I'll phone Ah Jung.

587
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,940
Wait here for a moment.

588
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,240
Hello?

589
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,480
Where are you?

590
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,150
Okay, I know.

591
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,490
I'm sorry.  I have to go.

592
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,900
Lawyer Kang's wife has just passed away.

593
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,000
Are we leaving immediately?

594
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,200
If you want to take the KTX Express, you have to leave immediately.

595
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,770
What about you? Will you watch the movie on your own?

596
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,440
Okay, be careful going back home.

597
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,010
I'll call you when I've arrived. I'm leaving.

598
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,580
Oh dear! What should I do?

599
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,150
I didn't bring an umbrella.

600
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,550
Eating udon on a rainy day?

601
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,060
Go back after this drink.

602
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,990
Listen to me, jerk.

603
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,130
I, Hwang Suk Bong, after 47 years of my life, am in love for the first time!

604
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,070
But the torture of love is too painful.

605
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,540
Haven't I told you to give up?

606
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,100
Have you given up?

607
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,570
You haven't  given up either?

608
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,140
Are you able to give up on Yoon Joo? Rotten brat.

609
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,550
Hey, what's wrong with you again?

610
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,680
Let me give you a toast! Drink up quickly.  Don't be like this.

611
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,090
Acting according to your own wishes,

612
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,330
is your heart aching? Mine is, too.

613
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,570
What kind of business is this, on such a rainy day...?

614
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,840
How can he leave without even a backward glance?

615
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,150
Stop nagging!  You're not a recorder!

616
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,980
You still want to speak for yourself!

617
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,020
Shin Ae Kyung's life is really strange!

618
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,320
I used to be very popular.

619
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,260
Who told you to fall in love with a man who's already a father?

620
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,560
Who would expect that child to be so cruel?

621
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,130
You're right, I am that ruthless girl,

622
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,700
which is why I'm accompanying you in the middle of the night, instead of Dad, right?

623
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,010
This is quite a good place!

624
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,840
Let's come again.

625
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,140
I have many coupons.

626
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,220
If you want to get married, just get married.

627
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,890
Stop looking at my mood, just get married.

628
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,290
What are you saying?  We're so old already.
Why are you still talking about marriage?

629
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,900
Hey, I already said I won't get married. What's wrong with you?

630
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,770
Are you trying to kill me?

631
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,950
Still sleeping? I'm back!

632
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,520
Why are you back so early?

633
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,090
Didn't you say you're staying up late?

634
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:04,390
There were quite a lot of guests, so I came back.

635
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:05,860
Go back to sleep.

636
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,870
I made you breakfast.  Go to sleep after you eat.

637
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,070
I don't feel like eating.

638
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:22,740
I'll just nap a while, I still have to return to school.

639
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,350
Yesterday, I went out for you.

640
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,450
What do you mean by that?

641
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,650
Miss Shin Ae Kyung.

642
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,750
Oh, really?

643
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,220
Thank you!

644
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,360
What's wrong?  Did she say something?

645
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,760
"How can he leave without even looking back? Life is sure fickle!"

646
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:51,740
Amongst all your friends, father you seem the oldest.

647
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,670
Don't say that.

648
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,880
If he covers his hair, your father is youthful looking too!

649
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,340
Youthful?!

650
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,810
Hey, you don't believe it?

651
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,320
Take a look.  I'm not just a youthful face,

652
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,790
I'm talented, too!

653
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,390
What's wrong again?

654
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:19,630
That... Didn't Ajumma talk to you about marriage?

655
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:26,970
She has already come this far. I think she wants to marry you, right?

656
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,810
Isn't it right?

657
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,380
We're just friends now, friends.

658
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,050
Already so old, but still calling each other "friends". Disgusting!

659
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,350
Hurry up and eat breakfast!

660
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,590
What is this?

661
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,630
Weren't you firmly against the idea of us marrying before?

662
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,240
How... How was it? Under last night's heavy rain?

663
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:35,980
Did you have fun?

664
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,110
Yeah. The sauna really wasn't bad, and was quite clean too.

665
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,950
You went to the sauna?

666
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,720
Didn't you say you'll go with me?

667
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,920
It's not like that, let me explain.

668
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,230
Really, I'm disappointed.

669
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,730
Suk... Suk Bong ah, it's a mis... misunderstanding.

670
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,700
I don't care who's the client.  Hurry, come over.

671
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,010
I'm telling you to hurry over now!

672
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,940
What? You can't come?

673
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,410
Come over immediately!

674
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,610
Congratulations, congratulations!

675
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,550
Congratulations!

676
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,020
Why did you guys come here?

677
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,850
Jae Bum gave us a call.

678
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,060
Would your husband let you be discharged by yourself?

679
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,990
He called and implored us to take good care of you.

680
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:27,730
Really?

681
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,300
Aren't you touched?

682
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,130
I'm touched.

683
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,880
You really did as she said.

684
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,340
Of course not!

685
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:49,380
Sorry, I only have this here.

686
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,950
There are still such good things here?

687
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,150
And you're saying, "I only have this"?

688
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,820
I originally wanted to drink this on last year's wedding anniversary.

689
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,290
So why didn't you?

690
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,230
Because Jae Bum bought a better one.

691
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,430
Showing off again.

692
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:07,370
We really should have called Ah Jung!

693
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,570
Talking about her marriage would be very interesting!

694
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,400
Don't mention her.

695
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,610
Why? Something wrong happened?

696
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,010
You came to comfort me, but you're making me more furious.

697
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:20,950
What is it?

698
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:27,190
To be honest, you're actually very mean to Ah Jung.

699
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,020
What?

700
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,490
It's only us here, so there's no need to hide it.

701
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,690
Didn't you deliberately exclude Ah Jung?

702
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,630
Didn't you pretend to be her good friend and defend her?

703
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,460
You went behind her back and isolated her.

704
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,770
So Ran! Your hypocrisy hurts Ah Jung.

705
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,600
So what?

706
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:46,640
Why did you not say anything that time?  It's only now that you help speak up for her?

707
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:51,040
What's wrong with you? Can we not fight?

708
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,610
That's enough! Don't talk about it anymore.

709
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,450
I'm tired. Why don't you all leave now?

710
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:02,790
It's always like this!

711
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,620
Why open that bottle of wine?

712
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,460
Okay, let's go.

713
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,930
We'll leave you to drink alone.

714
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,290
I'm leaving.

715
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,380
Why did you mention Ah Jung in front of So Ran?

716
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,580
Don't tell me I was wrong.

717
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,050
No, I'm just saying...

718
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,620
So Ran needs to change.

719
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,920
With a good husband like Jae Bum, how can she be this dissatisfied?

720
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,960
That's right, if my husband were to dote on me that way, I'd carry him everyday.

721
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:46,100
Although I'm already very jealous of So Ran, I'm even more jealous of Ah Jung.

722
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,200
What is there to be jealous of?

723
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:51,970
She's already married yet she's still dedicated to her work. Of course I'm  jealous of her.

724
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,170
I'm not even jealous of So Ran.

725
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,640
Aigoo, just don't talk about it anymore.

726
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,180
Hello, this is Gong Ah Jung.

727
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,850
This is the front desk.  There is an express delivery that you must personally collect.

728
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,320
Okay...  I got it.

729
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,260
Ah, so busy.

730
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:20,600
Hello, I'm Gong Ah Jung.

731
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,270
Ah, please sign your name over here.

732
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,610
Please accept this.

733
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,180
Thank you, please take care.

734
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:34,910
You have worked hard.

735
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,380
Take care.

736
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,580
What's this?

737
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:49,600
Violated the agreement to denounce the rumours.

738
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,270
Intentionally damaging my reputation in my own company...

739
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:56,940
This guy, really...

740
00:51:58,770 --> 00:51:59,510
Hyun Gi Joon!

741
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,340
President Hyun Gi Joon!

742
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,180
Excuse me, is there a problem?

743
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,740
I have something to discuss with your president.

744
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,680
I'm sorry, but the President is not here.

745
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,880
Then I'll just wait for him here.

746
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,550
There's no use waiting. If you have a problem then discuss it with our lawyer.

747
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,120
Lawyer? Isn't that too much?

748
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,590
I've already said it was a misunderstanding. I've even apologized!

749
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,060
What's the meaning of this?

750
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,630
He clearly said that it's all right.

751
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,460
Stabbing me in the back with a knife.

752
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,560
Really...

753
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,670
Please go back in.

754
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,500
Otherwise, I'll have no choice but to call someone.

755
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,800
At least explain to me what this is all about.

756
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,110
Security team.

757
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,940
This is the office of the  president's secretary.

758
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,880
There's a strange woman here.  The president is not around...

759
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,890
Miss, should we get you a taxi?

760
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:57,130
That's really...

761
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:03,370
If it really, really can't be, then forget it.

762
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,240
You said she already came.

763
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,550
Yes, I told her to go talk with a lawyer.

764
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,110
Did she agree?

765
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,680
She doesn't have any other choice.

766
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:22,820
What is it?

767
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,020
It's nothing.

768
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,330
I didn't think she would give up so easily.

769
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,160
What?

770
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,730
She is a woman who does not make sense.

771
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:35,670
I thought she wouldn't give up so easily.

772
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,240
No, how come you sound as if you're disappointed?

773
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,440
Park Hoon.

774
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,540
She might come back.

775
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,380
Why don't you go to the main entrance and stop her from leaving?

776
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,950
Do you want to announce that we've chased away our guests?

777
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:48,150
Right, that is also a possibility.

778
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,620
Just let them be a bit more vigilant.

779
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,450
Yes.

780
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,420
Is the president inside?

781
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,730
Yes, how can I help you?

782
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,870
The guest who checked into the single occupancy room,

783
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:09,070
has never stopped complaining.

784
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:10,900
Is it a problem guest?

785
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,000
That's right.

786
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,780
I think the president should handle this matter by himself.

787
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,710
Park Ji Yoon.

788
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,550
What do you think you are doing?

789
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,480
You can't even solve this matter?

790
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,690
The guest in the single occupancy room...

791
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:29,260
is Ms. Gong Ah Jung.

792
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,290
Look at this pool of water.

793
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:36,230
You must be thinking that I'm a petty woman who complains over the smallest things.

794
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,430
But have you even considered that if I step in this pool of water...

795
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:40,630
I'd surely slip and fall?

796
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:41,730
At the very least, I'd have a concussion.

797
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,200
If something went really wrong, I could be partially paralyzed.

798
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,140
Or worse, I could die!

799
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,240
Too scary.

800
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,440
Omo, too scary.

801
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,540
I came to this very expensive room

802
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,750
just to bleed to death?

803
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:53,850
Did I come here to die?

804
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,050
If you're not well, we'll send you to the hospital immediately.

805
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,980
No, I don't need to go to the hospital.

806
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,090
Get your president over here.

807
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,550
President!

808
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:03,020
Guest.

809
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,430
You're making things difficult for us.

810
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:08,160
Is it not enough?

811
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,000
Do you need me to make more noise?

812
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,930
Look at this puddle of water.

813
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,580
President Hyun Gi Joon.

814
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:32,020
Why is a couple's spat causing such a huge uproar?

815
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:44,130
What's the matter?

816
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:47,800
This broken thing came flying in.

817
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,900
What is this all about?

818
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,740
You should know.

819
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,200
Must you be like this?

820
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,670
Is there a reason not to be like this then?

821
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:56,610
Even your beloved evidence was found.

822
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,650
Matters are much easier now, thanks to your actions at the party that day.

823
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,850
Your act of fraud, telling people that I'm your husband,

824
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:05,050
was witnessed by more than twenty people.

825
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,520
What do you mean by "fraud"?

826
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,620
Do I have to repeat myself?

827
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,820
That time I was out of my mind.  I made a mistake.

828
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,290
That's not something I should be concerned about.

829
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,390
Mr. Hyun Gi Joon.

830
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:14,960
When you understand the situation, go and discuss it with the lawyers.

831
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,430
If you continue like this,

832
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,000
your situation will only get worse.

833
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,930
Can't we resolve this peacefully?

834
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,770
You had your opportunity,

835
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:25,970
but you lost it.

836
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,810
Think about it again.

837
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:28,540
Is it really impossible?

838
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,110
If you think twice, then you will just regret it twice, right?

839
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,680
Is there anything else you want to say?

840
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,350
Goodbye!

841
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,650
Marry me.

842
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,990
What did you say?

843
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,090
I'm not saying we should get married for real,

844
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,560
just pretend we got married.

845
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,400
No, no. What I mean is...

846
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,600
I don't want to do anything, I just want to keep the status quo.

847
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,330
Just for two months.

848
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,170
No... Even a month will do.

849
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:58,640
Miss Gong Ah Jung.

850
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,210
You want to sue me, right? Then okay, just sue me.

851
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,040
But, please just delay it for a while.

852
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,240
Do you really want to be humiliated?

853
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,710
It doesn't matter if I'm humiliated.

854
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,280
Whether you want to sue me or not, it's up to you.

855
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,380
I will accept it.

856
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:14,050
Please, let's be married for just one month.

857
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,720
Why should I do so?

858
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,290
Because I'm begging you!

859
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:25,060
My days are quickly coming to an end.

860
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,900
I have only one month to live.

861
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,730
So, I beg of you...

862
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,040
That's even more unacceptable!

863
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:36,810
Thank you for staying in our hotel, guest.

864
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:39,380
Next time I see you, it will be in court.

865
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:42,680
No.

866
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:50,390
What should I do? It can't end this way.

867
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,100
The day is coming to an end.

868
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,770
What exactly is she planning to do?

869
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:07,640
Welcome to World Hotel.

870
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,370
Therefore...

871
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,210
Did he say he'll sue you after a month?

872
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:41,040
Just one month.

873
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,240
Live as if the rumors are true.

874
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,440
is that request so difficult?

875
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,650
That's really...

876
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:48,750
Why must it be so!

877
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,680
To end it like this, isn't it an injustice?

878
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,620
I'm being sued because of these rumours, anyway.

879
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,190
At least I shouldn't have any regrets!

880
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,430
Yoo So Ran.

881
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,730
That wretched girl saw that my husband is Hyun Gi Joon,

882
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,570
and became speechless.

883
00:59:08,570 --> 00:59:11,140
It's the first time I've seen her like that.

884
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,340
Just based on the fact that I'm married to Hyun Gi Joon,

885
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:17,010
she must have felt it's useless to play around with me.

886
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:19,580
I don't know how to say it.

887
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,150
This is so amusing!

888
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,650
In the end, it all happened because I wanted to take revenge on that person.

889
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:32,420
Yes... revenge.

890
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,990
Revenge for my three wasted years.

891
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,200
You are still angry, huh?

892
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:41,970
I'm so angry, I'm going crazy!

893
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,270
Because I'm too angry!

894
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,310
In the past three years, I haven't done anything at all.

895
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,510
I couldn't love... I couldn't date...

896
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,180
couldn't get married..

897
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,850
I didn't do anything.

898
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:02,150
I also couldn't like someone again.

899
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,460
Just forever alone like this.

900
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:12,430
Just forever alone like this.

901
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,040
Hey.

902
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:21,240
Why are you still crying?

903
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,710
You're attractive.

904
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:26,750
Even if you wanted to get married immediately,
it wouldn't be a problem for you.

905
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,250
I... It's not that I want to get married,

906
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:35,920
but to be already married!

907
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,490
Immediately.

908
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,930
This is a major issue.

909
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,870
Furthermore, the husband is Hyun Gi Joon.

910
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,580
Are you okay?

911
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,820
Hey... Hey...

912
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,710
Do you have any idea how expensive the rooms are here?

913
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,140
A stomach ache!

914
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:03,280
Oh my stomach! Oh, my head!

915
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,980
Where is this place?

916
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,650
Who is it?

917
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,930
Hey, why are you here?

918
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:26,400
Gong Ah Jung.

919
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:30,800
Do you really want to have a fake marriage with Hyun Gi Joon?

920
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,570
If that's what you really want,

921
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,610
I can help you out.

922
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,700
-=Next Episode Preview=-

923
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,710
Whatever the guest does, and whoever they do it with, is their own private business.

924
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,990
Is this woman mentally ill?

925
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,190
She obviously has a boyfriend.  Why does she still want a fake marriage with me?

926
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:11,600
This is among friends.

927
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,670
Go and apologize immediately.

928
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,900
It's already late to apologize.

929
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,990
If you don't come out immediately, I will tell your friends everything.

930
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,500
Use your mind and think. Why must I meet your friends?

931
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:24,200
Welcome to Korea.

932
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:25,400
Thank you... Thank you...

933
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,800
What do you mean you didn't see Chairman Cha?
Didn't you send someone to the airport?

934
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:30,330
Did not think you will get married with Yoon Joo.

935
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,950
Is it the end, after breaking off the engagement?

936
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,050
Then I...

937
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,110
To the Hyun Gi Joon, and also another one Oh Yoon Joo, is it?

938
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,070
I don't know that man!

939
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,050
You see?

940
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,850
It's a stalker, a stalker.

941
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,240
You said you won't prosecute anymore?

942
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:44,050
I've already said that it's for court reference.

943
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,450
Even if it's a lie,

944
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:47,400
in the future, please talk to me through my lawyer.

945
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,550
No! No!

946
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,640
The one who picked you, really claimed to be my wife?

947
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,650
Ah Jung, you have become really bad!

948
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,170
Ah Jung! Let's be more intimate in the future, okay?

949
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,800
Stop playing games.  Tell me your intention.

950
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:02,350
Honey, I'm here.
