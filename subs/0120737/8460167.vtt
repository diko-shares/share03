02:44:24.689 --> 02:44:28.484
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1547
02:44:29.152 --> 02:44:32.155
Treacherous as the sea!

1548
02:44:32.655 --> 02:44:37.618
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1549
02:44:38.077 --> 02:44:40.455
All shall love me...

1550
02:44:40.663 --> 02:44:43.499
...and despair.

1551
02:44:57.597 --> 02:45:01.893
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1552
02:45:02.185 --> 02:45:04.645
...and go into the West...

1553
02:45:04.854 --> 02:45:09.317
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.

1554
02:45:12.904 --> 02:45:17.033
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1555
02:45:17.992 --> 02:45:19.494
...is to be alone.

1556
02:45:22.830 --> 02:45:25.541
This is Neo ya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1557
02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:27.376
And I am its keeper.

1558
02:45:30.546 --> 02:45:34.217
This task was appointed to you.

1559
02:45:35.218 --> 02:45:38.137
And if you do not find a way...

1560
02:45:39.347 --> 02:45:41.349
...no one will.

1561
02:45:41.724 --> 02:45:44.894
Then I know what I must do.

1562
02:45:45.561 --> 02:45:46.729
It's just...

1563
02:45:50.024 --> 02:45:52.235
... I'm afraid to do it.

1564
02:45:55.738 --> 02:46:00.910
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1565
02:46:06.249 --> 02:46:11.963
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1566
02:46:12.755 --> 02:46:16.092
They were Elves once.

1567
02:46:17.260 --> 02:46:20.596
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1568
02:46:20.763 --> 02:46:23.933
...tortured and mutilated.

1569
02:46:24.267 --> 02:46:29.605
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1570
02:46:29.897 --> 02:46:31.732
And now...

1571
02:46:33.192 --> 02:46:35.069
...perfected.

1572
02:46:35.778 --> 02:46:38.948

Saruman!

1575
02:47:06.809 --> 02:47:10.271
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1576
02:47:10.479 --> 02:47:13.357
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1577
02:47:13.608 --> 02:47:16.485
You will taste Man-flesh!

1578
02:47:21.616 --> 02:47:25.328
One of the half lings carries
something of great value.

1579
02:47:25.494 --> 02:47:29.665
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1580
02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:32.793
Kill the others.

1581

CELEBORN: Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

02:48:11.332 --> 02:48:12.917
Elvish way bread.

1585
02:48:15.419 --> 02:48:18.422
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1586
02:48:24.887 --> 02:48:26.889
How many did you eat?

1587
02:48:27.056 --> 02:48:28.724
Four.

Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

02:48:48.327 --> 02:48:53.416
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

You are being tracked.

...of outrunning the enemy
to the Falls of Rauros.

1597
02:49:27.992 --> 02:49:32.788
GALADRIEL: My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1598
02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:36.584
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1599
02:49:41.964 --> 02:49:44.425
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1600
02:49:44.592 --> 02:49:47.803
They have already seen service in war.

1601

Thank you, my lady.

1606
02:50:05.196 --> 02:50:08.532
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1607
02:50:14.997 --> 02:50:18.000
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1608
02:50:18.167 --> 02:50:20.336
Nothing.

1609
02:50:20.961 --> 02:50:24.298
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1610
02:50:24.924 --> 02:50:30.137
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1611
02:50:37.186 --> 02:50:38.729
Actually...

1612
02:50:38.938 --> 02:50:40.523
There was one thing.

1613
02:50:41.357 --> 02:50:44.026
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

For her love,

I fear tho grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

1619
02:51:05.089 --> 02:51:08.425
[IN ELVISH]
I would have her leave those shores,

1620
02:51:09.969 --> 02:51:12.888
and he with her people.

1621
02:51:14.890 --> 02:51:20.604
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1622
02:51:21.105 --> 02:51:24.191

That choice is yet before her.

1623

You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1624
02:51:28.028 --> 02:51:33.868
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1625
02:51:34.034 --> 02:51:38.372
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

...having looked my last upon that

1637
02:52:51.320 --> 02:52:54.657
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

What was her gift?

1639
02:52:57.076 --> 02:53:01.997
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1640
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:05.668
She gave me three.

GOLLUM. He has tracked us since Moria.

1643
02:54:54.985 --> 02:54:58.113
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1644
02:54:58.322 --> 02:55:01.492
But he's too clever a waterman.

1645
02:55:02.326 --> 02:55:05.621
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1646
02:55:05.788 --> 02:55:08.082
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

-No, Sam.

Minas Tirith is the safer road.

You know that.
From there we can regroup.

Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1660
02:55:59.341 --> 02:56:02.261
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1661

You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1662
02:56:06.557 --> 02:56:09.393
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1663
02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:12.563
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1664
02:56:12.771 --> 02:56:16.066
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1665
02:56:16.316 --> 02:56:18.527
But you will not see that.

02:56:18.861 --> 02:56:20.279
You are afraid!

-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?

our way through Emyn Muil...

That is our road.

I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

-We should leave now.
-No.

02:58:57.477 --> 02:59:01.940
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1686
02:59:02.149 --> 02:59:05.569
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1687
02:59:05.819 --> 02:59:09.823
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1688
02:59:10.324 --> 02:59:14.494
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1689
02:59:16.496 --> 02:59:21.460
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1690
02:59:21.960 --> 02:59:23.670
Where's Frodo?

1691
02:59:49.279 --> 02:59:51.198
BOROMIR:
None of us should wander alone.

1692
02:59:52.574 --> 02:59:54.701
You, least of all.

1693
02:59:54.910 --> 02:59:57.371
So much depends on you.

1694
02:59:58.413 --> 03:00:00.374
Frodo?

1695
03:00:07.506 --> 03:00:10.050
I know why you seek solitude.

1696
03:00:10.759 --> 03:00:14.221
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1697
03:00:15.013 --> 03:00:18.058
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1698
03:00:19.601 --> 03:00:22.270
There are other ways, Frodo.

1699
03:00:22.521 --> 03:00:26.316
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

1700
03:00:26.566 --> 03:00:30.320
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1701
03:00:30.570 --> 03:00:33.615
Warning? Against what?

1702
03:00:33.824 --> 03:00:35.951
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1703
03:00:36.159 --> 03:00:39.788
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1704
03:00:40.038 --> 03:00:43.792
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

1705
03:00:45.585 --> 03:00:48.922
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1706
03:00:50.465 --> 03:00:52.551
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

1707
03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:57.431
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.

1708
03:00:59.266 --> 03:01:02.602
What chance do you think you have?

1709
03:01:02.769 --> 03:01:07.441
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1710
03:01:07.649 --> 03:01:11.361
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1711
03:01:13.488 --> 03:01:15.615
You fool!

1712
03:01:15.782 --> 03:01:19.786
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1713
03:01:19.953 --> 03:01:22.789
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1714
