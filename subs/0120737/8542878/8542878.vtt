00:00:34.443 --> 00:00:37.613
Female voice:
The world is changed.

2
00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:40.741
I feel it in the water.

3
00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:44.411
I feel it in the earth.

4
00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:48.999
I smell it in the air.

5
00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.376
Much that once was...

6
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.086
Is lost.

7
00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:56.798
For none now live who remember it.

8
00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:14.107
It began with the forging
of the great rings.

9
00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:16.318
Three were given to the elves:

10
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:20.239
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

11
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:23.367
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

12
00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:28.539
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

13
00:01:28.997 --> 00:01:30.332
And nine...

14
00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:33.544
Nine rings were gifted
to the race of men...

15
00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:37.506
Who, above all else, desire power.

16
00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:43.845
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

17
00:01:45.347 --> 00:01:48.517
But they were all of them deceived.

18
00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.852
For another ring was made.

19
00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.274
In the land of mordor,
in the fires of mount doom...

20
00:01:55.691 --> 00:02:00.237
The dark lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

21
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.489
To control all others.

22
00:02:02.573 --> 00:02:06.660
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

23
00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:10.998
And his will to dominate all life.

24
00:02:11.957 --> 00:02:15.836
One ring to rule them all.

25
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.422
One by one...

26
00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:23.302
The free lands of middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

27
00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:26.471
But there were some who resisted.

28
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.685
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of mordor.

29
00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:36.440
And on the slopes of mount doom, they
fought for the freedom of middle-earth.

30
00:03:06.762 --> 00:03:09.389
Victory was near.

31
00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:15.896
But the power of the ring...

32
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.148
Could not be undone.

33
00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.758
It was in this moment...

34
00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:47.344
When all hope had faded...

35
00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:51.598
That isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

36
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:29.177
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of middle-earth, was defeated.

37
00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:38.311
The ring passed to isildur...

38
00:04:38.395 --> 00:04:42.649
Who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

39
00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:45.569
But the hearts of men...

40
00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:48.196
Are easily corrupted.

41
00:04:48.447 --> 00:04:53.076
And the ring of power
has a will of its own.

42
00:05:18.268 --> 00:05:20.896
It betrayed isildur...

43
00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:25.150
To his death.

44
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:33.283
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

45
00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.744
Were lost.

46
00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:38.872
History became legend...

47
00:05:38.955 --> 00:05:41.082
Legend became myth.

48
00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:44.127
And for
two and a half thousand years...

49
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:47.964
The ring passed
out of all knowledge.

50
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.426
Until, when chance came...

51
00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:55.222
It ensnared a new bearer.

52
00:05:56.556 --> 00:06:01.394
Gollum: My precious.

53
00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:04.231
Female voice: The ring came
to the creature gollum...

54
00:06:04.314 --> 00:06:08.276
Who took it deep into the tunnels
of the misty mountains.

55
00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.446
And there it consumed him.

56
00:06:11.696 --> 00:06:13.824
Gollum: It came to me.

57
00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:18.453
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:23.291
My precious.

59
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.423
Female voice: The ring brought
to gollum unnatural long life.

60
00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:34.469
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

61
00:06:34.553 --> 00:06:39.266
And in the gloom of gollum's cave,
it waited.

62
00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.644
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

63
00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:45.814
Rumor grew of a shadow in the east...

64
00:06:45.897 --> 00:06:48.817
Whispers of a nameless fear.

65
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.320
And the ring of power perceived...

66
00:06:52.404 --> 00:06:55.240
Its time had now come.

67
00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:00.328
It abandoned gollum.

68
00:07:00.996 --> 00:07:05.500
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

69
00:07:06.334 --> 00:07:11.006
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

70
00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:12.257
Bilbo: What's this?

71
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.884
Female voice: A hobbit.

72
00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:16.845
Bilbo Baggins of the shire.

73
00:07:16.928 --> 00:07:18.805
A ring.

74
00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.807
Gollum: Losfl

75
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.105
my precious is lost!

76
00:07:27.188 --> 00:07:29.524
Female voice:
For the time will soon come...

77
00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:34.946
When hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

78
00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:42.829
Bilbo:
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:42.913 --> 00:07:44.164
In the year 1400...

80
00:07:46.374 --> 00:07:48.001
By shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:54.090
Bag end, bagshot row, hobbiton,
westfarthing...

82
00:07:55.467 --> 00:07:56.885
The shire...

83
00:08:04.476 --> 00:08:07.812
The third age of this world.

84
00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:23.370
There and back again:

85
00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.416
By bilbo Baggins.

86
00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:39.135
Where to begin?

87
00:08:40.428 --> 00:08:41.471
Ah, yes...

88
00:08:45.934 --> 00:08:47.644
"Concerning...

89
00:08:51.606 --> 00:08:55.193
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four farthings of the shire...

90
00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:57.362
For many hundreds of years...

91
00:08:57.445 --> 00:09:00.532
Quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

92
00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:03.827
By the world of the big folk.

93
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.874
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

94
00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.211
Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

95
00:09:13.294 --> 00:09:17.424
Being neither renowned
as great warriors...

96
00:09:17.507 --> 00:09:21.761
Nor counted among the very wise.

97
00:09:26.141 --> 00:09:29.144
Frodo! Someone at the door.

98
00:09:30.353 --> 00:09:32.897
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

99
00:09:33.148 --> 00:09:37.610
That hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

100
00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:40.196
A rather unfair observation...

101
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.034
As we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

102
00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:47.162
And the smoking of pipe-weed.

103
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.498
But where our hearts truly lie...

104
00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:52.792
Is in peace and quiet...

105
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.670
And good, tilled earth.

106
00:09:55.754 --> 00:10:01.009
For all hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

107
00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:08.641
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

108
00:10:08.725 --> 00:10:13.980
But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:

109
00:10:14.564 --> 00:10:20.445
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

110
00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:27.827
Frodo, the door!

111
00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:32.944
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

112
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:44.844
Male voice:
Down from the door where it began

113
00:10:49.557 --> 00:10:53.353
And I must follow if! Can

114
00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:58.441
the road goes ever on and on

115
00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:02.237
down from the door where it began

116
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.325
now far ahead the road has gone

117
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:11.746
-and I must follow if! Can
-you're late.

118
00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:18.837
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

119
00:11:19.587 --> 00:11:24.259
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

120
00:11:35.603 --> 00:11:38.731
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

121
00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:46.281
You didn't think I'd miss
your uncle bilbo's birthday?

122
00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:50.118
How is the old rascal?

123
00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:54.247
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

124
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.833
You know bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

125
00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:59.002
Well, that should please him.

126
00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:00.962
Half the shire's been invited.

127
00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:03.882
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

128
00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.388
Bilbo:
And so life in the shire goes on...

129
00:12:10.471 --> 00:12:13.641
Very much as it has
this past age...

130
00:12:13.725 --> 00:12:19.355
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

131
00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:21.399
If it comes at all.

132
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.154
For things are made to endure
in the shire...

133
00:12:26.237 --> 00:12:29.782
Passing from one generation
to the next.

134
00:12:30.158 --> 00:12:35.205
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the hill...

135
00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:36.664
In bag end.

136
00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:42.295
And there always will be.

137
00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:46.341
To tell you the truth,
bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

138
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.969
I mean, more than usual.

139
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.931
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

140
00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:58.645
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

141
00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:12.992
Where's it gone?

142
00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:41.854
He's up to something.

143
00:13:49.988 --> 00:13:52.573
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

144
00:13:52.657 --> 00:13:54.450
But I know you have something
to do with it.

145
00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:55.785
Good gracious me.

146
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:58.913
Before you came along, we bagginses
were very well thought of.

147
00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:00.039
Indeed.

148
00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:02.542
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

149
00:14:03.126 --> 00:14:09.090
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

150
00:14:09.173 --> 00:14:12.885
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

151
00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:17.056
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

152
00:14:17.515 --> 00:14:19.392
Oh, really?

153
00:14:25.023 --> 00:14:26.983
Gandalf! Gandalf!

154
00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.472
Female hobbit 1:
Fireworks, Gandalf!

155
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.996
Female hobbit 2: Gandalf!
Male hobbit: Fireworks, Gandalf!

156
00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:04.562
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

157
00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:10.777
So am I.

158
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.422
Whoa, whoa.

159
00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:44.185
Bilbo: No, thank you!

160
00:15:44.268 --> 00:15:48.356
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

161
00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:51.984
And what about very old friends?

162
00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.035
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

163
00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:06.332
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

164
00:16:08.084 --> 00:16:10.086
You haven't aged a day.

165
00:16:16.676 --> 00:16:18.719
Come on, come in!

166
00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:21.305
Welcome, welcome.

167
00:16:22.473 --> 00:16:25.017
Oh, here we are.

168
00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:29.188
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

169
00:16:29.272 --> 00:16:33.192
I've got a few bottles
of the old winyard left. 1296.

170
00:16:33.276 --> 00:16:37.363
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

171
00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:43.077
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

172
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:45.872
Just tea, thank you.

173
00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:52.086
Oh!

174
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.880
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

175
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.383
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

176
00:16:57.633 --> 00:17:02.930
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

177
00:17:03.014 --> 00:17:06.392
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

178
00:17:06.642 --> 00:17:10.563
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

179
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.276
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

180
00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.237
I've just found some sponge cake.

181
00:17:21.157 --> 00:17:22.637
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

182
00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.915
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

183
00:17:30.082 --> 00:17:32.460
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

184
00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:35.486
Female hobbit:
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

185
00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:37.173
I'm not at home!

186
00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:45.806
It's the sackville-bagginses.

187
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.059
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

188
00:17:48.726 --> 00:17:51.312
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

189
00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:54.333
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

190
00:17:54.357 --> 00:17:56.275
Never giving me a moment's peace.

191
00:17:57.068 --> 00:18:00.655
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

192
00:18:00.738 --> 00:18:05.326
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

193
00:18:05.409 --> 00:18:09.497
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

194
00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.916
All the arrangements are made.

195
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.461
Oh, thank you.

196
00:18:16.212 --> 00:18:18.339
Frodo suspects something.

197
00:18:18.422 --> 00:18:20.967
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

198
00:18:21.217 --> 00:18:23.803
Not some blockheaded bracegirdle
from hardbottle.

199
00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:27.139
You will tell him, won't you?

200
00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:30.101
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

201
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.813
I know.

202
00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:39.485
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

203
00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:43.614
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the shire.

204
00:18:45.157 --> 00:18:47.535
The woods, the fields.

205
00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:49.996
Little rivers.

206
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.169
I am old, Gandalf.

207
00:18:58.504 --> 00:19:03.843
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

208
00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:08.556
I feel thin.

209
00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:10.349
Sort of stretched...

210
00:19:11.684 --> 00:19:15.062
Like butter scraped
over too much bread.

211
00:19:15.146 --> 00:19:19.734
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

212
00:19:19.817 --> 00:19:23.154
And I don't expect I shall return.

213
00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:28.534
In fact, I mean not to.

214
00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:35.333
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the southfarthing.

215
00:19:52.683 --> 00:19:55.269
Gandalf, my old friend...

216
00:19:55.353 --> 00:19:58.230
This will be a night to remember.

217
00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:22.088
Bilbo: Hello, hello.

218
00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:26.425
Fatty bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

219
00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:30.054
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

220
00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:36.227
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

221
00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:39.063
Go on!

222
00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:50.950
So there I was...

223
00:20:51.242 --> 00:20:55.329
At the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

224
00:20:55.413 --> 00:20:57.498
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

225
00:20:57.581 --> 00:21:00.167
About how they were
going to cook us.

226
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:05.297
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

227
00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.969
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

228
00:21:10.052 --> 00:21:13.639
That the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

229
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.143
And turned them all to stone!

230
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.816
Merry: Quickly.

231
00:21:27.945 --> 00:21:29.989
Up they go!

232
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.160
No, the big one.

233
00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:46.213
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

234
00:21:46.297 --> 00:21:48.340
Are all these children yours?

235
00:21:48.424 --> 00:21:51.469
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

236
00:21:53.471 --> 00:21:54.805
Female hobbit: Bilbo?

237
00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:58.184
Sackville-bagginses!

238
00:21:58.434 --> 00:21:59.518
Quickly, hide!

239
00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:11.530
Thank you, my boy.

240
00:22:13.032 --> 00:22:15.451
You're a good lad, Frodo.

241
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.538
I'm very selfish, you know.

242
00:22:19.955 --> 00:22:23.417
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

243
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:25.896
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

244
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.505
But it wasn't out of charity.

245
00:22:28.214 --> 00:22:29.715
I think it was because...

246
00:22:29.799 --> 00:22:32.176
Of all my numerous relations...

247
00:22:32.468 --> 00:22:35.971
You were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

248
00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:38.098
Bilbo, have you been
at the gaffer's home brew?

249
00:22:40.226 --> 00:22:42.937
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

250
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.357
The point is, Frodo...

251
00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:51.403
You'll be all right.

252
00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.951
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

253
00:22:57.034 --> 00:22:58.619
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

254
00:22:58.702 --> 00:23:00.246
This was your idea.

255
00:23:18.764 --> 00:23:21.642
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

256
00:23:21.725 --> 00:23:25.104
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

257
00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:42.288
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

258
00:23:43.497 --> 00:23:48.085
Gandalf:
Meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took.

259
00:23:48.168 --> 00:23:50.087
I might've known.

260
00:23:55.968 --> 00:23:58.053
Female hobbit: Speech, bilbo!

261
00:23:58.929 --> 00:24:00.347
Male hobbit: Speech!

262
00:24:00.431 --> 00:24:01.557
Speech!

263
00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:09.106
My dear bagginses and boffins...

264
00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:12.151
Tooks and brandybucks...

265
00:24:12.234 --> 00:24:14.862
Grubbs, chubbs...

266
00:24:14.945 --> 00:24:16.030
Hornblowers...

267
00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:18.824
Bolgers...

268
00:24:19.241 --> 00:24:20.868
Bracegirdles...

269
00:24:20.951 --> 00:24:23.621
- And proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

270
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:28.959
Today is my 111th birthday!

271
00:24:30.753 --> 00:24:32.379
Happy birthday!

272
00:24:32.463 --> 00:24:36.842
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

273
00:24:36.926 --> 00:24:39.845
Such excellent
and admirable hobbits.

274
00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:43.557
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

275
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:48.312
And I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

276
00:24:51.815 --> 00:24:53.442
I, uh—...

277
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.658
I have things to do.

278
00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:09.166
I've put this off far too long.

279
00:25:13.003 --> 00:25:16.966
I regret to announce this is the end!

280
00:25:18.133 --> 00:25:19.301
I'm going now.

281
00:25:20.386 --> 00:25:23.305
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

282
00:25:25.683 --> 00:25:26.892
Good bye.

283
00:26:00.134 --> 00:26:03.303
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

284
00:26:03.387 --> 00:26:06.890
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

285
00:26:06.974 --> 00:26:12.146
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

286
00:26:12.229 --> 00:26:14.523
It was just a bit of fun.

287
00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:18.360
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

288
00:26:19.737 --> 00:26:23.323
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

289
00:26:23.407 --> 00:26:26.243
As often as I can spare them.

290
00:26:26.326 --> 00:26:29.621
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

291
00:26:29.705 --> 00:26:33.083
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

292
00:26:33.709 --> 00:26:37.588
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

293
00:26:38.672 --> 00:26:41.633
No. Wait, it's...

294
00:26:44.136 --> 00:26:46.805
Here in my pocket.

295
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.688
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

296
00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:59.818
Yet, after all, why not?

297
00:27:01.403 --> 00:27:06.283
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

298
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.952
Is that so hard?

299
00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:10.412
Well, no.

300
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.333
And yes.

301
00:27:16.293 --> 00:27:19.338
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

302
00:27:19.588 --> 00:27:21.381
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

303
00:27:21.465 --> 00:27:25.761
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

304
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.013
It's mine.

305
00:27:29.264 --> 00:27:31.767
My own.

306
00:27:32.101 --> 00:27:36.146
- My precious.
- Precious?

307
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.233
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

308
00:27:39.316 --> 00:27:42.027
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

309
00:27:42.111 --> 00:27:44.863
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

310
00:27:45.114 --> 00:27:48.033
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

311
00:27:48.117 --> 00:27:52.371
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

312
00:27:52.621 --> 00:27:56.291
I am not trying to Rob you.

313
00:28:01.338 --> 00:28:03.048
I'm trying to help you.

314
00:28:11.515 --> 00:28:14.852
All your long years,
we've been friends.

315
00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:17.396
Trust me as you once did.

316
00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:21.066
Let it go.

317
00:28:22.192 --> 00:28:24.611
You're right, Gandalf.

318
00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:29.408
The ring must go to Frodo.

319
00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:33.787
It's late. The road is long.

320
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:36.415
Yes, it is time.

321
00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:44.256
The ring is still in your pocket.

322
00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:21.960
I've thought up an ending for my book:

323
00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:28.675
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

324
00:29:28.759 --> 00:29:32.262
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

325
00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:34.765
Goodbye, Gandalf.

326
00:29:37.267 --> 00:29:40.145
Goodbye, dear bilbo.

327
00:29:47.945 --> 00:29:52.157
Bilbo:
The road goes ever on and on

328
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:57.079
until our next meeting.

329
00:30:24.481 --> 00:30:28.193
Bilbo: It's mine. My own.

330
00:30:28.277 --> 00:30:31.738
My precious.

331
00:30:41.957 --> 00:30:44.876
My precious.

332
00:30:46.503 --> 00:30:48.755
Precious.

333
00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:51.466
He's gone, hasn't he?

334
00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:57.264
He talked for so long about leaving...

335
00:30:57.514 --> 00:31:00.225
I didn't think he'd really do it.

336
00:31:14.865 --> 00:31:16.533
Bilbo's ring.

337
00:31:16.867 --> 00:31:19.286
He's gone to stay with the elves.

338
00:31:19.369 --> 00:31:22.539
He's left you bag end.

339
00:31:26.126 --> 00:31:28.754
Along with all his possessions.

340
00:31:28.837 --> 00:31:31.757
The ring is yours now.

341
00:31:34.384 --> 00:31:37.929
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

342
00:31:38.013 --> 00:31:40.390
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

343
00:31:40.474 --> 00:31:44.770
- —Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

344
00:31:45.645 --> 00:31:48.273
I don't understand.

345
00:31:55.906 --> 00:31:58.283
Keep it secret.

346
00:31:58.367 --> 00:32:00.160
Keep it safe.

347
00:32:35.112 --> 00:32:37.322
Gollum: Shire!

348
00:32:37.656 --> 00:32:40.784
Baggins!

349
00:33:29.332 --> 00:33:32.294
Gandalf:
"The year 3434 of the second age.

350
00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:36.923
Here follows the account of isildur,
high king of gondor...

351
00:33:37.007 --> 00:33:40.719
And the finding
of the ring of power."

352
00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:46.099
"It has come to me.

353
00:33:46.183 --> 00:33:49.769
The one ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

354
00:33:49.853 --> 00:33:53.440
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

355
00:33:53.523 --> 00:33:57.444
For I will risk
no hurt to the ring.

356
00:33:57.527 --> 00:34:00.071
It is precious to me...

357
00:34:00.906 --> 00:34:03.575
Though I buy it with great pain.

358
00:34:06.703 --> 00:34:10.916
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

359
00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:15.921
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

360
00:34:16.171 --> 00:34:20.217
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

361
00:34:39.861 --> 00:34:41.905
Baggins.

362
00:34:42.405 --> 00:34:46.451
There's no bagginses around here.
They're all up in hobbiton.

363
00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:49.621
That way.

364
00:34:55.627 --> 00:34:57.879
To heal my heart and drown my woe

365
00:34:57.963 --> 00:35:00.382
rain may fall and wind may blow

366
00:35:02.592 --> 00:35:04.177
many miles to go

367
00:35:04.261 --> 00:35:06.304
sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

368
00:35:06.388 --> 00:35:08.682
and the stream that falls
from hill to plain

369
00:35:08.765 --> 00:35:10.684
better than rain or rippling brook

370
00:35:10.767 --> 00:35:13.228
is a mug of beer inside this took

371
00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:19.484
there's been some strange folk
crossing the shire.

372
00:35:19.943 --> 00:35:23.780
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

373
00:35:24.281 --> 00:35:25.657
War is brewing.

374
00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:29.244
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

375
00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:32.038
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

376
00:35:32.122 --> 00:35:36.710
You're beginning to sound like that old
bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

377
00:35:36.793 --> 00:35:39.879
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

378
00:35:39.963 --> 00:35:41.506
And proud of it.

379
00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.925
- Cheers, gaffer.
- Cheers.

380
00:35:44.009 --> 00:35:48.221
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

381
00:35:48.305 --> 00:35:52.684
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

382
00:35:56.021 --> 00:35:58.273
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

383
00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:02.944
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

384
00:36:03.028 --> 00:36:05.530
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

385
00:36:05.614 --> 00:36:10.201
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

386
00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:12.370
Does she?

387
00:36:13.038 --> 00:36:16.041
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

388
00:36:40.815 --> 00:36:43.318
Is it secret? Is it safe?

389
00:36:52.202 --> 00:36:54.329
What are you doing?

390
00:37:06.925 --> 00:37:09.469
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

391
00:37:09.552 --> 00:37:10.762
It's quite cool.

392
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:16.101
What can you see?

393
00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:20.271
Can you see anything?

394
00:37:22.982 --> 00:37:24.442
Nothing.

395
00:37:25.068 --> 00:37:27.070
There's nothing.

396
00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:29.614
Wait.

397
00:37:33.743 --> 00:37:35.954
There are markings.

398
00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:40.959
It's some form of elvish.
I can't read it.

399
00:37:41.042 --> 00:37:43.628
There are few who can.

400
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.008
The language is that of mordor,
which I will not utter here.

401
00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:53.054
In the common tongue, it says:

402
00:37:53.138 --> 00:37:56.683
"One ring to rule them all...

403
00:37:56.975 --> 00:37:59.352
One ring to find them...

404
00:37:59.436 --> 00:38:01.646
One ring to bring them all...

405
00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.983
And in the darkness bind them."

406
00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:08.695
This is the one ring...

407
00:38:08.778 --> 00:38:14.200
Forged by the dark lord Sauron
in the fires of mount doom.

408
00:38:14.284 --> 00:38:18.329
Taken by isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

409
00:38:19.122 --> 00:38:21.666
Bilbo found it.

410
00:38:22.125 --> 00:38:24.043
- In gollum's cave.
- Yes.

411
00:38:24.294 --> 00:38:28.882
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet
in bilbo's keeping...

412
00:38:28.965 --> 00:38:32.427
Prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

413
00:38:33.052 --> 00:38:37.557
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in mordor.

414
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.059
The ring has awoken.

415
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:43.104
It's heard its master's call.

416
00:38:43.188 --> 00:38:47.150
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

417
00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:54.949
Gandalf: No, Frodo.

418
00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:59.245
The spirit of Sauron endured.

419
00:38:59.329 --> 00:39:04.709
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

420
00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:07.212
Sauron has returned.

421
00:39:08.087 --> 00:39:10.256
His orcs have multiplied.

422
00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:14.469
His fortress at barad-dur
is rebuilt in the land of mordor.

423
00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:19.474
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

424
00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.768
He is seeking it.

425
00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:25.730
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

426
00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.775
For the ring yearns above all else...

427
00:39:28.858 --> 00:39:32.278
To return to the hand
of its master.

428
00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.364
They are one...

429
00:39:34.447 --> 00:39:37.617
The ring and the dark lord.

430
00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:38.785
Frodo...

431
00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:41.287
He must never find it.

432
00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:42.497
Frodo: All right.

433
00:39:42.789 --> 00:39:47.168
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

434
00:39:47.252 --> 00:39:50.004
No one knows it's here, do they?

435
00:39:55.635 --> 00:39:56.886
Do they, Gandalf?

436
00:39:57.929 --> 00:40:01.307
There is one other who knew
that bilbo had the ring.

437
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.645
I looked everywhere
for the creature gollum.

438
00:40:05.728 --> 00:40:08.022
But the enemy found him first.

439
00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:12.193
Gandalf: I don't know how long
they tortured him.

440
00:40:12.277 --> 00:40:16.906
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

441
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.200
Gollum: Shire!

442
00:40:19.284 --> 00:40:21.035
Baggins!

443
00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:26.124
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

444
00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:29.961
Who goes there?

445
00:40:31.671 --> 00:40:32.922
Take it, Gandalf!

446
00:40:33.298 --> 00:40:34.424
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

447
00:40:34.507 --> 00:40:37.010
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

448
00:40:37.093 --> 00:40:40.471
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

449
00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:44.183
I dare not take it.

450
00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:46.978
Not even to keep it safe.

451
00:40:48.146 --> 00:40:50.148
Understand, Frodo...

452
00:40:50.815 --> 00:40:54.444
I would use this ring
from a desire to do good.

453
00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:05.580
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

454
00:41:06.164 --> 00:41:09.083
- But it cannot stay in the shire!
- No.

455
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.587
No, it can't.

456
00:41:17.884 --> 00:41:19.302
What must I do?

457
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.557
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

458
00:41:24.641 --> 00:41:27.977
Get out of the shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

459
00:41:28.227 --> 00:41:29.395
Bree.

460
00:41:29.479 --> 00:41:32.398
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

461
00:41:32.482 --> 00:41:35.068
At the inn of the prancing pony.

462
00:41:35.151 --> 00:41:38.988
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

463
00:41:39.072 --> 00:41:41.115
I don't have any answers.

464
00:41:42.617 --> 00:41:48.247
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

465
00:41:48.331 --> 00:41:50.500
He'll know what to do.

466
00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:53.920
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

467
00:41:54.212 --> 00:41:56.714
That name is not safe
outside the shire.

468
00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.635
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

469
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.430
I can cut across country
easily enough.

470
00:42:06.933 --> 00:42:08.267
My dear Frodo.

471
00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:11.646
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

472
00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:14.774
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

473
00:42:14.857 --> 00:42:17.318
And yet, after a hundred years...

474
00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:19.612
They can still surprise you.

475
00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:22.448
Get down.

476
00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:38.256
Confound it all, samwise gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

477
00:42:38.339 --> 00:42:42.927
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

478
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:45.555
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

479
00:42:45.638 --> 00:42:48.641
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

480
00:42:48.725 --> 00:42:49.809
Nothing important.

481
00:42:50.393 --> 00:42:54.564
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a dark lord and the end of the world but...

482
00:42:54.647 --> 00:42:59.444
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

483
00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:04.115
Perhaps not.

484
00:43:05.324 --> 00:43:08.786
I've thought of a better use for you.

485
00:43:10.496 --> 00:43:13.499
Gandalf:
Come along, samwise. Keep up.

486
00:43:15.001 --> 00:43:17.378
Be careful, both of you.

487
00:43:17.462 --> 00:43:20.381
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

488
00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:23.468
Birds, beasts.

489
00:43:25.219 --> 00:43:27.013
Is it safe?

490
00:43:28.723 --> 00:43:30.183
Never put it on...

491
00:43:30.266 --> 00:43:33.728
For the agents of the dark lord
will be drawn to its power.

492
00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.354
Always remember, Frodo...

493
00:43:35.855 --> 00:43:39.025
The ring is trying to get back
to its master.

494
00:43:39.442 --> 00:43:41.527
It wants to be found.

495
00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.864
This is what?

496
00:44:27.156 --> 00:44:29.200
If I take one more step...

497
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:33.579
It'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

498
00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:39.377
Come on, Sam.

499
00:44:47.802 --> 00:44:49.595
Remember what bilbo used to say:

500
00:44:50.179 --> 00:44:53.975
-"It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
Bilbo: "Going out your door.

501
00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:58.604
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

502
00:44:58.688 --> 00:45:02.900
There's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

503
00:45:22.253 --> 00:45:23.379
Wood-elves.

504
00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:40.605
They're going to the harbor
beyond the white towers.

505
00:45:41.147 --> 00:45:42.940
To the grey havens.

506
00:45:43.524 --> 00:45:45.610
Sam:
They're leaving middle-earth.

507
00:45:45.693 --> 00:45:47.945
Frodo: Never to return.

508
00:45:50.823 --> 00:45:52.950
I don't know why...

509
00:45:53.618 --> 00:45:56.037
It makes me sad.

510
00:45:58.122 --> 00:46:02.752
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

511
00:46:03.461 --> 00:46:05.213
Just shut your eyes...

512
00:46:05.296 --> 00:46:08.174
And imagine you're back
in your own bed...

513
00:46:08.257 --> 00:46:12.261
With a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

514
00:46:21.562 --> 00:46:24.315
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

515
00:46:24.398 --> 00:46:27.318
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

516
00:46:29.654 --> 00:46:31.989
Me neither, Sam.

517
00:47:00.518 --> 00:47:03.604
Male voice: Smoke rises
from the mountain of doom.

518
00:47:03.688 --> 00:47:05.481
The hour grows late.

519
00:47:05.564 --> 00:47:09.235
And Gandalf the grey
rides to lsengard...

520
00:47:09.318 --> 00:47:11.904
Seeking my counsel.

521
00:47:11.988 --> 00:47:16.075
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

522
00:47:16.158 --> 00:47:17.493
My old friend.

523
00:47:17.743 --> 00:47:19.370
Saruman.

524
00:47:24.166 --> 00:47:27.211
Saruman: You are sure of this?
Gandalf: Beyond any doubt.

525
00:47:28.004 --> 00:47:30.298
So the ring of power has been found.

526
00:47:30.381 --> 00:47:33.718
All these long years,
it was in the shire.

527
00:47:33.801 --> 00:47:37.013
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

528
00:47:37.638 --> 00:47:42.143
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

529
00:47:43.019 --> 00:47:47.064
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

530
00:47:47.148 --> 00:47:48.649
Time?

531
00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:52.194
What time do you think we have?

532
00:47:52.653 --> 00:47:56.574
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

533
00:47:56.657 --> 00:47:58.909
He cannot yet take physical form...

534
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.871
But his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

535
00:48:02.538 --> 00:48:07.585
Concealed within his fortress,
the lord of mordor sees all.

536
00:48:08.169 --> 00:48:14.091
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

537
00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:18.763
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

538
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.935
A great eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

539
00:48:25.895 --> 00:48:27.772
The eye of Sauron.

540
00:48:27.855 --> 00:48:30.566
He is gathering all evil to him.

541
00:48:30.649 --> 00:48:33.235
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

542
00:48:33.319 --> 00:48:35.571
For an assault upon middle-earth.

543
00:48:35.905 --> 00:48:38.282
You know this?

544
00:48:38.783 --> 00:48:40.284
How?

545
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:42.578
I have seen it.

546
00:48:42.995 --> 00:48:46.207
A palantir is a dangerous tool,
saruman.

547
00:48:46.916 --> 00:48:48.417
Why?

548
00:48:48.876 --> 00:48:51.587
Why should we fear to use it?

549
00:48:54.215 --> 00:48:58.177
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

550
00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.555
We do not know who else
may be watching.

551
00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.936
The hour is later than you think.

552
00:49:07.019 --> 00:49:09.397
Sauron's forces are already moving.

553
00:49:11.649 --> 00:49:14.402
The nine have left minas morgul.

554
00:49:14.777 --> 00:49:15.861
The nine?

555
00:49:15.945 --> 00:49:19.115
They crossed the river isen
on midsummer's Eve...

556
00:49:19.198 --> 00:49:21.992
Disguised as riders in black.

557
00:49:22.076 --> 00:49:26.080
- They've reached the shire?
- They will find the ring.

558
00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:29.917
And kill the one who carries it.

559
00:49:44.515 --> 00:49:48.936
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

560
00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:52.481
There are none who can.

561
00:49:54.984 --> 00:49:57.736
Against the power of mordor...

562
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.531
There can be no victory.

563
00:50:02.491 --> 00:50:05.661
We mustjoin with him, Gandalf.

564
00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:09.290
We mustjoin with Sauron.

565
00:50:11.959 --> 00:50:14.628
It would be wise, my friend.

566
00:50:15.087 --> 00:50:16.589
Tell me...

567
00:50:16.672 --> 00:50:17.798
Friend...

568
00:50:18.799 --> 00:50:23.345
When did saruman the wise
abandon reason for madness?

569
00:51:02.843 --> 00:51:04.553
I gave you the chance...

570
00:51:05.679 --> 00:51:08.390
Of aiding me willingly...

571
00:51:08.474 --> 00:51:12.686
But you have elected
the way of pain!

572
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.461
Sam: Mr. Frodo?

573
00:51:38.087 --> 00:51:39.880
Frodo? Frodo!

574
00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:44.593
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

575
00:51:44.677 --> 00:51:47.721
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

576
00:51:48.556 --> 00:51:52.434
"Don't you lose him, samwise gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

577
00:51:52.685 --> 00:51:56.313
Sam, we're still in the shire.
What could possibly happen?

578
00:51:59.275 --> 00:52:00.317
Frodo.

579
00:52:00.568 --> 00:52:02.861
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

580
00:52:02.945 --> 00:52:04.405
Get off him.

581
00:52:04.905 --> 00:52:06.448
Come on, Frodo.

582
00:52:06.532 --> 00:52:08.450
Frodo:
What's the meaning of this?

583
00:52:08.909 --> 00:52:10.661
You've been into farmer maggot's crop!

584
00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:15.291
Maggot: You get back here!

585
00:52:16.292 --> 00:52:17.668
Get out of my field!

586
00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:20.713
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

587
00:52:20.796 --> 00:52:23.841
Merry: I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

588
00:52:23.924 --> 00:52:25.134
Pippin: And some cabbages.

589
00:52:25.217 --> 00:52:28.220
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

590
00:52:28.304 --> 00:52:32.516
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Merry: Yes, pippin. My point is...

591
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.893
He's clearly overreacting.

592
00:52:49.992 --> 00:52:52.536
Oh, that was close.

593
00:52:53.621 --> 00:52:56.749
I think I've broken something.

594
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.169
Trust a brandybuck and a took!

595
00:53:00.252 --> 00:53:04.006
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

596
00:53:04.089 --> 00:53:06.383
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

597
00:53:15.142 --> 00:53:16.644
Pippin: That's mine.

598
00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:21.023
That's nice, merry.

599
00:53:21.565 --> 00:53:23.651
Merry: Here's a nice one, Sam.

600
00:53:23.734 --> 00:53:26.320
I think we should get off the road.

601
00:53:35.496 --> 00:53:36.955
Get off the road!

602
00:53:37.039 --> 00:53:38.582
Quick!

603
00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:52.763
Be quiet!

604
00:54:59.079 --> 00:55:01.248
What was that?

605
00:55:33.947 --> 00:55:35.449
Sam: Anything?

606
00:55:36.116 --> 00:55:37.618
Nothing.

607
00:55:38.327 --> 00:55:40.621
What is going on?

608
00:55:41.163 --> 00:55:44.958
That black rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

609
00:55:46.293 --> 00:55:47.795
Frodo?

610
00:55:48.504 --> 00:55:49.546
Get down!

611
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.732
I have to leave the shire.

612
00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:12.110
Sam and I must get to Bree.

613
00:56:12.194 --> 00:56:13.654
Right.

614
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.324
Bucklebury ferry. Follow me.

615
00:56:25.582 --> 00:56:26.959
Pippin: Run!

616
00:56:28.168 --> 00:56:30.170
Merry: This way! Follow me!

617
00:56:33.715 --> 00:56:34.758
Pippin: Run!

618
00:56:48.021 --> 00:56:49.773
Merry: Get the rope, Sam!

619
00:56:54.695 --> 00:56:56.113
Pippin: Run, Frodo!

620
00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:57.614
Frodo: Go! Pippin: Hurry!

621
00:56:57.698 --> 00:57:00.367
Merry: Frodo, come on!

622
00:57:01.285 --> 00:57:03.287
Sam: Come on! Faster!
Pippin: Jump!

623
00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:22.472
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The brandywine bridge. 20 miles.

624
00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:38.572
Come on.

625
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:53.170
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the prancing pony.

626
00:57:59.635 --> 00:58:03.639
What's more, out of the shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

627
00:58:04.056 --> 00:58:07.184
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

628
00:58:08.185 --> 00:58:10.812
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

629
00:58:10.896 --> 00:58:13.523
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

630
00:58:13.607 --> 00:58:16.526
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

631
00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:18.820
Can't be too careful.

632
00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:42.052
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

633
00:59:06.201 --> 00:59:07.828
Excuse me.

634
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:11.707
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

635
00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:18.005
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

636
00:59:18.088 --> 00:59:22.759
Always proud to cater
to the little folk, mister...?

637
00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:25.971
Underhill. My name's underhill.

638
00:59:27.264 --> 00:59:29.808
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the grey.

639
00:59:29.891 --> 00:59:33.103
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

640
00:59:36.106 --> 00:59:37.858
Oh, yes...

641
00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:40.110
I remember. Elderly chap.

642
00:59:40.444 --> 00:59:43.363
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

643
00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.615
Not seen him for six months.

644
00:59:52.372 --> 00:59:53.665
What do we do now?

645
01:00:02.257 --> 01:00:04.176
He'll be here. He'll come.

646
01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.014
Man: Get out of my way!

647
01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:13.060
What's that?

648
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.854
This, my friend, is a pint.

649
01:00:15.937 --> 01:00:17.647
It comes in pints?

650
01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:21.693
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

651
01:00:28.033 --> 01:00:31.870
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

652
01:00:35.415 --> 01:00:36.917
Excuse me.

653
01:00:42.881 --> 01:00:47.302
He's one of them rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the wilds.

654
01:00:47.552 --> 01:00:52.057
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as strider.

655
01:00:54.434 --> 01:00:55.685
Strider.

656
01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:11.910
Voice of the ring: Baggins.

657
01:01:14.746 --> 01:01:16.915
Baggins.

658
01:01:22.295 --> 01:01:27.425
Baggins. Baggins.

659
01:01:29.261 --> 01:01:31.555
Pippin:
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

660
01:01:32.347 --> 01:01:35.267
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

661
01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:38.478
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

662
01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:40.897
And my third cousin, twice removed...

663
01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:47.154
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

664
01:02:16.683 --> 01:02:19.144
Sau Ron: You cannot hide.

665
01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:25.275
I see you.

666
01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:29.696
There is no life...

667
01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:32.073
In the void.

668
01:02:32.157 --> 01:02:33.700
Only...

669
01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:47.005
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

670
01:02:51.676 --> 01:02:52.802
What do you want?

671
01:02:52.886 --> 01:02:55.286
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

672
01:02:55.347 --> 01:02:58.350
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

673
01:02:58.642 --> 01:03:01.228
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

674
01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:05.065
But to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

675
01:03:05.565 --> 01:03:08.193
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

676
01:03:10.612 --> 01:03:14.574
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

677
01:03:18.578 --> 01:03:21.122
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, longshanks.

678
01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:26.962
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

679
01:03:27.045 --> 01:03:30.048
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

680
01:03:30.131 --> 01:03:31.174
They're coming.

681
01:04:54.883 --> 01:04:56.384
What are they?

682
01:04:58.553 --> 01:05:00.680
They were once men.

683
01:05:01.181 --> 01:05:03.475
Great kings of men.

684
01:05:03.558 --> 01:05:06.770
Then Sauron the deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

685
01:05:07.354 --> 01:05:10.440
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

686
01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:14.069
One by one, falling into darkness.

687
01:05:14.152 --> 01:05:16.696
Now they are slaves to his will.

688
01:05:19.074 --> 01:05:20.825
They are the nazgul.

689
01:05:20.909 --> 01:05:23.703
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

690
01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:25.955
At all times they feel...

691
01:05:26.039 --> 01:05:28.083
The presence of the ring...

692
01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:32.754
Drawn to the power of the one.
They will never stop hunting you.

693
01:05:42.722 --> 01:05:45.642
- Frodo: Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

694
01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:57.987
How do we know this strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

695
01:05:58.071 --> 01:06:00.949
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

696
01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:05.245
- And feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

697
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:08.706
We have no choice but to trust him.

698
01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:12.293
- But where is he leading us?
- Strider: To rivendell, master gamgee.

699
01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:17.966
- To the house of elrond.
- Sam: Did you hear that? Rivendell.

700
01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:21.302
We're going to see the elves.

701
01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:47.245
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

702
01:06:47.328 --> 01:06:50.081
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

703
01:06:50.165 --> 01:06:52.459
What about second breakfast?

704
01:06:55.879 --> 01:06:59.090
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, pip.

705
01:06:59.174 --> 01:07:04.554
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

706
01:07:04.637 --> 01:07:08.850
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

707
01:07:14.314 --> 01:07:15.899
Merry: Pippin!

708
01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:35.919
What do they eat
when they can't get hobbit?

709
01:08:14.582 --> 01:08:16.793
Who is she?

710
01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.088
This woman you sing of.

711
01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.969
'Tis the lady of li'ithien.

712
01:08:26.052 --> 01:08:31.266
The elf-maiden who gave her love
to beren, a mortal.

713
01:08:33.101 --> 01:08:35.228
What happened to her?

714
01:08:37.438 --> 01:08:39.941
She died.

715
01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:46.322
Get some sleep, Frodo.

716
01:08:56.583 --> 01:09:00.712
Saru man: The power of isengard
is at your command...

717
01:09:00.795 --> 01:09:05.300
Sauron, lord of the earth.

718
01:09:08.636 --> 01:09:14.434
Sau Ron:
Build me an army worthy of mordor.

719
01:09:20.148 --> 01:09:24.611
What orders from mordor, my lord?
What does the eye command?

720
01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:26.988
We have work to do.

721
01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:14.202
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

722
01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:16.412
Rip them all down.

723
01:10:43.856 --> 01:10:46.734
This was the great watchtower
of amon scil.

724
01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:51.114
We shall rest here tonight.

725
01:11:02.834 --> 01:11:06.337
These are for you.
Keep them close.

726
01:11:06.421 --> 01:11:08.965
I'm going to have a look around.

727
01:11:11.342 --> 01:11:13.261
Stay here.

728
01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:17.974
Merry: My tomato's burst.

729
01:11:18.224 --> 01:11:20.184
Pippin: Could I have some bacon?

730
01:11:20.268 --> 01:11:22.270
Merry: Want a tomato, Sam?

731
01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:26.357
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

732
01:11:26.441 --> 01:11:29.318
Sam: We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
Frodo: Put it out, you fools!

733
01:11:29.402 --> 01:11:33.448
Put it out!
Pippin: That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

734
01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:38.513
Back, you devils!

735
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:09.145
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.

736
01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:47.183
Strider!

737
01:14:49.977 --> 01:14:55.483
- Help him, strider.
- He's been stabbed by a morgul blade.

738
01:14:56.984 --> 01:15:01.864
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

739
01:15:06.452 --> 01:15:07.578
Hurry!

740
01:15:07.662 --> 01:15:11.749
We're six days from rivendell!
He'll never make it!

741
01:15:11.832 --> 01:15:13.709
Hold on, Frodo.

742
01:17:54.245 --> 01:17:57.331
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

743
01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.336
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

744
01:18:05.297 --> 01:18:07.133
Is he going to die?

745
01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:12.138
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

746
01:18:17.309 --> 01:18:21.188
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the athelas plant?

747
01:18:21.272 --> 01:18:22.857
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

748
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.150
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

749
01:18:24.233 --> 01:18:27.403
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

750
01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:45.921
Female: What's this?
A ranger caught off his guard?

751
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:11.864
Frodo.

752
01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:30.633
Who is she?

753
01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.052
Frodo.

754
01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:36.805
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

755
01:19:39.058 --> 01:19:41.310
He's not going to last.

756
01:19:41.393 --> 01:19:44.104
We must get him to my father.

757
01:19:44.855 --> 01:19:47.775
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

758
01:19:47.858 --> 01:19:53.989
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

759
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.165
What are they saying?

760
01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:10.839
I do not fear them.

761
01:20:20.683 --> 01:20:22.142
Arwen...

762
01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:34.905
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

763
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.231
Give up the halfling, she-elf.

764
01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.734
If you want him, come and claim him.

765
01:23:35.377 --> 01:23:37.754
Frodo, no.

766
01:23:37.838 --> 01:23:40.257
Frodo, don't give in.

767
01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:42.384
Not now.

768
01:23:53.312 --> 01:23:55.814
Arwen: What grace is given me...

769
01:23:56.482 --> 01:23:58.317
Let it pass to him.

770
01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:00.694
Let him be spared.

771
01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.363
Save him.

772
01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:20.923
- Where am I?
- Gandalf: You are in the house of elrond.

773
01:24:21.381 --> 01:24:27.888
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

774
01:24:29.848 --> 01:24:33.644
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

775
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:38.357
And you're lucky to be here too.

776
01:24:39.024 --> 01:24:43.111
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

777
01:24:43.195 --> 01:24:47.366
But you have some strength in you,
my dear hobbit.

778
01:24:54.957 --> 01:24:57.459
What happened, Gandalf?

779
01:24:58.418 --> 01:25:03.799
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

780
01:25:08.554 --> 01:25:10.305
I was delayed.

781
01:25:11.181 --> 01:25:15.394
A friendship with saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

782
01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:24.152
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

783
01:25:24.444 --> 01:25:27.197
Embrace the power of the ring...

784
01:25:27.739 --> 01:25:30.284
Or embrace your own destruction!

785
01:25:32.578 --> 01:25:36.456
Gandalf:
There is only one lord of the ring.

786
01:25:36.707 --> 01:25:40.711
Only one who can bend it to his will.

787
01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:45.465
And he does not share power.

788
01:25:59.813 --> 01:26:03.191
So you have chosen death.

789
01:26:13.243 --> 01:26:17.039
Gandalf? What is it?

790
01:26:17.998 --> 01:26:19.791
Nothing, Frodo.

791
01:26:20.459 --> 01:26:22.377
Sam: Frodo!

792
01:26:23.712 --> 01:26:26.214
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

793
01:26:26.298 --> 01:26:29.051
Sam has hardly left your side.

794
01:26:29.301 --> 01:26:31.501
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

795
01:26:31.845 --> 01:26:36.975
By the skills of lord elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

796
01:26:38.477 --> 01:26:42.064
Welcome to rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

797
01:27:30.112 --> 01:27:33.490
- Frodo: Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

798
01:27:40.330 --> 01:27:42.082
Frodo: "There and back again:

799
01:27:42.332 --> 01:27:45.085
A hobbit's tale, by bilbo Baggins."

800
01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:51.717
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

801
01:27:52.050 --> 01:27:55.846
Wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

802
01:27:56.304 --> 01:27:58.598
Visit lake-town...

803
01:27:58.849 --> 01:28:02.227
See the lonely mountain again.

804
01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:07.566
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

805
01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:21.455
Frodo: I miss the shire.

806
01:28:21.872 --> 01:28:27.002
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

807
01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:30.922
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

808
01:28:33.884 --> 01:28:37.471
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

809
01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:45.896
I'm not like you, bilbo.

810
01:28:47.022 --> 01:28:49.357
My dear boy.

811
01:28:53.445 --> 01:28:57.407
- Sam: Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

812
01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.076
No harm in being prepared.

813
01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.829
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

814
01:29:02.913 --> 01:29:05.916
- More than anything.
- I did.

815
01:29:05.999 --> 01:29:07.959
It's just...

816
01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:11.421
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

817
01:29:11.505 --> 01:29:15.300
We got the ring this far,
to rivendell. And I thought...

818
01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:18.804
Seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

819
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:26.812
You are right, Sam.

820
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:31.733
We did what we set out to do.

821
01:29:32.317 --> 01:29:34.903
The ring will be safe in rivendell.

822
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:41.326
I am ready to go home.

823
01:29:42.077 --> 01:29:44.204
Elrond: His strength returns.

824
01:29:44.287 --> 01:29:50.043
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

825
01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:53.213
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the ring...

826
01:29:53.296 --> 01:29:57.133
The hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

827
01:29:57.217 --> 01:30:00.595
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

828
01:30:00.846 --> 01:30:06.351
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

829
01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:11.106
Sauron's forces are massing in the east.
His eye is fixed on rivendell.

830
01:30:11.356 --> 01:30:14.150
And saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

831
01:30:14.234 --> 01:30:17.529
Our list of allies grows thin.

832
01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:21.157
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

833
01:30:21.241 --> 01:30:24.995
By foul craft, saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

834
01:30:25.078 --> 01:30:27.581
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of lsengard.

835
01:30:27.873 --> 01:30:32.502
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

836
01:30:32.586 --> 01:30:35.046
Saruman is coming for the ring.

837
01:30:35.505 --> 01:30:39.634
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

838
01:30:39.718 --> 01:30:44.139
We do not have the strength
to fight both mordor and lsengard!

839
01:30:50.395 --> 01:30:52.981
The ring cannot stay here.

840
01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.670
Elrond: This peril belongs
to all middle-earth.

841
01:31:15.921 --> 01:31:18.632
They must decide now how to end it.

842
01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:23.261
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

843
01:31:23.929 --> 01:31:27.557
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

844
01:31:27.641 --> 01:31:32.812
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

845
01:31:34.439 --> 01:31:37.275
It is in men
that we must place our hope.

846
01:31:37.609 --> 01:31:39.319
Men?

847
01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:43.490
Men are weak.
The race of men is failing.

848
01:31:43.573 --> 01:31:48.078
The blood of numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

849
01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:51.957
It is because of men
the ring survives.

850
01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:53.708
I was there, Gandalf.

851
01:31:54.376 --> 01:31:57.212
I was there 3000 years ago...

852
01:32:04.052 --> 01:32:06.513
When isildur took the ring.

853
01:32:06.596 --> 01:32:10.558
I was there the day
the strength of men failed.

854
01:32:13.103 --> 01:32:15.647
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

855
01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:20.860
Elrond: I led isildur into the heart
of mount doom...

856
01:32:21.111 --> 01:32:24.698
Where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

857
01:32:24.781 --> 01:32:27.409
Cast it into the fire!

858
01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:36.376
- Destroy it!
- No.

859
01:32:37.711 --> 01:32:39.879
Isildur!

860
01:32:40.338 --> 01:32:45.093
Elrond: It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

861
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:53.435
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

862
01:32:54.352 --> 01:32:58.064
There's no strength left
in the world of men.

863
01:32:58.148 --> 01:33:03.111
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

864
01:33:03.194 --> 01:33:06.614
One who could reclaim
the throne of gondor.

865
01:33:08.283 --> 01:33:12.162
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

866
01:33:12.245 --> 01:33:14.414
He has chosen exile.

867
01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:47.697
You are no elf.

868
01:33:47.781 --> 01:33:49.908
Men of the south are welcome here.

869
01:33:50.492 --> 01:33:53.995
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the grey.

870
01:33:55.497 --> 01:33:58.333
Then we are here on common purpose...

871
01:33:58.708 --> 01:34:00.168
Friend.

872
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:18.269
The shards of narsil.

873
01:34:21.731 --> 01:34:26.194
The blade that cut the ring
from Sauron's hand.

874
01:34:29.114 --> 01:34:31.366
It's still sharp.

875
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:43.336
But no more than a broken heirloom.

876
01:35:10.155 --> 01:35:13.199
Why do you fear the past?

877
01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:19.414
You are isildur's heir,
not isildur himself.

878
01:35:19.664 --> 01:35:23.084
You are not bound to his fate.

879
01:35:23.585 --> 01:35:27.589
The same blood flows in my veins.

880
01:35:30.592 --> 01:35:33.178
The same weakness.

881
01:35:35.889 --> 01:35:38.766
Your time will come.

882
01:35:38.850 --> 01:35:43.271
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

883
01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:36.491
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

884
01:36:38.493 --> 01:36:43.498
Forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

885
01:36:44.624 --> 01:36:46.542
And to that I hold.

886
01:36:46.626 --> 01:36:50.296
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

887
01:36:50.546 --> 01:36:54.425
Than face all the ages
of this world alone.

888
01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:06.646
I choose a mortal life.

889
01:37:07.981 --> 01:37:12.235
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

890
01:37:15.488 --> 01:37:17.991
Like my heart.

891
01:37:33.756 --> 01:37:37.552
Elrond: Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

892
01:37:37.635 --> 01:37:41.597
You've been summoned here
to answer the threat of mordor.

893
01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:47.103
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

894
01:37:47.353 --> 01:37:50.940
You will unite, or you will fall.

895
01:37:51.024 --> 01:37:55.361
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

896
01:37:57.196 --> 01:38:00.700
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

897
01:38:14.756 --> 01:38:16.507
So it is true.

898
01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:36.069
In a dream...

899
01:38:37.653 --> 01:38:40.782
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

900
01:38:41.074 --> 01:38:42.784
But in the west
a pale light lingered.

901
01:38:43.576 --> 01:38:45.328
A voice was crying:

902
01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:48.539
"Your doom is near at hand.

903
01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:52.293
Isildur's bane is found."

904
01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:58.132
Isildur's bane.

905
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.176
Boromir!

906
01:39:23.282 --> 01:39:27.161
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in imladris.

907
01:39:27.245 --> 01:39:31.040
I do not ask your pardon,
master elrond...

908
01:39:31.124 --> 01:39:33.292
For the black speech of mordor...

909
01:39:33.584 --> 01:39:35.002
May yet be heard...

910
01:39:35.086 --> 01:39:38.172
In every corner of the west!

911
01:39:38.256 --> 01:39:40.967
The ring is altogether evil.

912
01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:42.802
It is a gift.

913
01:39:43.386 --> 01:39:45.471
A gift to the foes of mordor.

914
01:39:46.097 --> 01:39:48.266
Why not use this ring?

915
01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:51.227
Long has my father,
the steward of gondor...

916
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:55.690
Kept the forces of mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

917
01:39:55.982 --> 01:39:58.192
Are your lands kept safe.

918
01:39:59.986 --> 01:40:04.323
Give gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

919
01:40:04.615 --> 01:40:08.369
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

920
01:40:08.995 --> 01:40:13.082
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

921
01:40:13.166 --> 01:40:16.752
And what would a ranger know
of this matter?

922
01:40:17.044 --> 01:40:19.046
This is no mere ranger.

923
01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:23.718
He is aragorn, son of arathorn.

924
01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:27.138
You owe him your allegiance.

925
01:40:31.225 --> 01:40:33.144
Aragorn.

926
01:40:34.896 --> 01:40:37.732
This is isildur's heir?

927
01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:42.778
And heir to the throne of gondor.

928
01:40:49.744 --> 01:40:52.580
Gondor has no king.

929
01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:56.083
Gondor needs no king.

930
01:41:02.757 --> 01:41:06.427
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

931
01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:10.932
You have only one choice.

932
01:41:11.182 --> 01:41:13.559
The ring must be destroyed.

933
01:41:18.773 --> 01:41:21.317
What are we waiting for?

934
01:41:33.454 --> 01:41:36.457
The ring cannot be destroyed, gimli,
son of gléin...

935
01:41:36.707 --> 01:41:40.962
By any craft that we here possess.

936
01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:45.675
The ring was made in the fires
of mount doom.

937
01:41:45.758 --> 01:41:49.637
Only there can it be unmade.

938
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.349
It must be taken deep into mordor...

939
01:41:53.432 --> 01:41:57.311
And cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

940
01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:02.483
One of you...

941
01:42:02.984 --> 01:42:05.152
Must do this.

942
01:42:08.072 --> 01:42:11.784
One does not simply walk into mordor.

943
01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:16.330
Its black gates are guarded
by more than just orcs.

944
01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:21.377
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

945
01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:25.715
The great eye is ever-watchful.

946
01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:28.593
It is a barren wasteland...

947
01:42:28.676 --> 01:42:32.388
Riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

948
01:42:32.471 --> 01:42:36.350
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

949
01:42:36.601 --> 01:42:40.855
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

950
01:42:41.105 --> 01:42:45.610
Have you heard nothing lord elrond
has said? The ring must be destroyed.

951
01:42:45.693 --> 01:42:48.404
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

952
01:42:48.487 --> 01:42:53.242
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

953
01:42:53.326 --> 01:42:58.748
I will be dead before I see the ring
in the hands of an elf!

954
01:43:00.666 --> 01:43:03.210
Never trust an elf!

955
01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:10.217
Gandalf: Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

956
01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:13.387
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

957
01:43:32.198 --> 01:43:34.408
I will take it.

958
01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:38.913
I will take it.

959
01:43:44.752 --> 01:43:47.797
I will take the ring to mordor.

960
01:43:55.846 --> 01:43:57.098
Though...

961
01:44:00.184 --> 01:44:02.019
I do not know the way.

962
01:44:04.021 --> 01:44:08.401
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

963
01:44:08.484 --> 01:44:11.904
As long as it is yours to bear.

964
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:16.117
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

965
01:44:16.867 --> 01:44:18.202
I will.

966
01:44:21.414 --> 01:44:23.708
You have my sword.

967
01:44:25.543 --> 01:44:27.628
And you have my bow.

968
01:44:28.212 --> 01:44:30.715
And my ax.

969
01:44:37.722 --> 01:44:40.725
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

970
01:44:42.727 --> 01:44:46.397
If this is indeed
the will of the council...

971
01:44:46.856 --> 01:44:49.275
- Then gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

972
01:44:51.902 --> 01:44:56.741
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

973
01:44:56.824 --> 01:45:01.746
Even when he is summoned
to a secret council and you are not.

974
01:45:02.246 --> 01:45:04.206
We're coming too!

975
01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:09.086
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

976
01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:12.673
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

977
01:45:13.007 --> 01:45:14.383
Mission.

978
01:45:14.467 --> 01:45:16.010
Quest.

979
01:45:16.469 --> 01:45:17.511
Thing.

980
01:45:19.346 --> 01:45:22.016
Well, that rules you out, pip.

981
01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:25.519
Nine companions.

982
01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:29.190
So be it.

983
01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:32.526
You shall be
the fellowship of the ring.

984
01:45:33.194 --> 01:45:35.112
Great!

985
01:45:35.196 --> 01:45:37.531
Where are we going?

986
01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:22.464
Elrond:

987
01:46:24.383 --> 01:46:28.178
Elrond:

988
01:46:30.598 --> 01:46:34.101
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

989
01:46:34.602 --> 01:46:36.270
That you'd never escape your fate.

990
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:40.441
The skill of the elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

991
01:46:40.858 --> 01:46:44.778
But only you have the power
to wield it.

992
01:46:45.779 --> 01:46:48.282
I do not want that power.

993
01:46:48.449 --> 01:46:51.118
I have never wanted it.

994
01:46:52.453 --> 01:46:55.080
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

995
01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:01.795
Bilbo: My old sword! Sting.

996
01:47:02.004 --> 01:47:03.130
Here, take it. Take it.

997
01:47:08.636 --> 01:47:12.598
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the elves, you know.

998
01:47:13.307 --> 01:47:17.394
The blade glows blue
when orcs are close.

999
01:47:17.603 --> 01:47:22.149
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1000
01:47:22.358 --> 01:47:24.818
Here's a pretty thing.

1001
01:47:27.321 --> 01:47:31.700
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1002
01:47:31.909 --> 01:47:35.162
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1003
01:47:38.707 --> 01:47:40.167
Oh!

1004
01:47:43.212 --> 01:47:45.255
My old ring.

1005
01:47:46.507 --> 01:47:50.427
I should very much like...

1006
01:47:50.678 --> 01:47:54.682
To hold it again, one last time.

1007
01:48:12.032 --> 01:48:15.703
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1008
01:48:16.036 --> 01:48:20.165
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1009
01:48:24.670 --> 01:48:27.715
I'm sorry for everything.

1010
01:48:42.730 --> 01:48:46.942
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of mount doom.

1011
01:48:48.277 --> 01:48:50.904
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1012
01:48:51.113 --> 01:48:54.241
Nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1013
01:48:57.703 --> 01:49:00.247
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1014
01:49:00.706 --> 01:49:04.626
May the blessings of elves and men...

1015
01:49:05.169 --> 01:49:07.755
And all free folk go with you.

1016
01:49:10.841 --> 01:49:14.928
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1017
01:49:33.363 --> 01:49:35.866
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1018
01:49:36.408 --> 01:49:38.243
Left.

1019
01:50:57.739 --> 01:51:02.161
Gandalf: We must hold to this course,
west of the misty mountains, for 40 days.

1020
01:51:02.369 --> 01:51:06.123
If our luck holds, the gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1021
01:51:06.331 --> 01:51:09.877
From there, our road
turns east to mordor.

1022
01:51:10.043 --> 01:51:13.881
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1023
01:51:15.716 --> 01:51:16.758
Move your feet.

1024
01:51:16.967 --> 01:51:18.486
- Merry: You look good, pippin.
- Thanks.

1025
01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:19.887
Boromir: Faster!

1026
01:51:21.263 --> 01:51:25.058
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1027
01:51:25.267 --> 01:51:28.020
I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1028
01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:31.565
Gandalf, we could pass through
the mines of Moria.

1029
01:51:32.232 --> 01:51:36.069
My cousin balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1030
01:51:36.403 --> 01:51:41.783
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1031
01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:52.085
Sorry!

1032
01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:54.421
Merry: Get him!

1033
01:51:55.756 --> 01:51:58.217
Merry: For the shire!
Pippin: Hold him. Hold him down, merry!

1034
01:51:58.759 --> 01:52:01.094
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1035
01:52:04.890 --> 01:52:06.610
Merry: You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1036
01:52:06.934 --> 01:52:09.603
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1037
01:52:09.853 --> 01:52:12.564
It's moving fast.

1038
01:52:12.773 --> 01:52:14.942
Against the wind.

1039
01:52:15.734 --> 01:52:17.861
- Crebain from dunland!
- Hide!

1040
01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:20.781
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1041
01:52:54.189 --> 01:52:55.941
Spies of saruman.

1042
01:52:56.692 --> 01:52:59.987
The passage south is being watched.

1043
01:53:01.154 --> 01:53:04.491
We must take the pass of caradhras.

1044
01:53:17.129 --> 01:53:18.839
Aragorn: Frodo!

1045
01:53:37.816 --> 01:53:40.068
Boromir.

1046
01:53:40.319 --> 01:53:44.531
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1047
01:53:44.740 --> 01:53:47.868
Over so small a thing.

1048
01:53:51.079 --> 01:53:53.040
Such a little thing.

1049
01:53:53.248 --> 01:53:54.708
Boromir!

1050
01:53:55.334 --> 01:53:58.045
Give the ring to Frodo.

1051
01:54:07.846 --> 01:54:09.890
As you wish.

1052
01:54:10.599 --> 01:54:12.601
I care not.

1053
01:54:48.011 --> 01:54:52.724
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over caradhras.

1054
01:54:52.933 --> 01:54:57.521
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1055
01:54:58.814 --> 01:55:01.775
If the mountain defeats you...

1056
01:55:02.025 --> 01:55:06.446
Will you risk
a more dangerous road?

1057
01:55:18.792 --> 01:55:21.670
There is a fell voice on the air.

1058
01:55:22.796 --> 01:55:24.297
It's saruman!

1059
01:55:33.181 --> 01:55:37.853
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1060
01:56:46.379 --> 01:56:48.215
We must get off the mountain!

1061
01:56:48.715 --> 01:56:53.053
Make for the gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1062
01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:56.556
The gap of Rohan takes us
too close to lsengard!

1063
01:56:56.723 --> 01:57:00.477
Gimli: We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1064
01:57:00.727 --> 01:57:03.563
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1065
01:57:05.398 --> 01:57:09.236
Saru man: Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

1066
01:57:09.903 --> 01:57:14.908
The dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1067
01:57:15.742 --> 01:57:20.622
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of khazad—dum:

1068
01:57:21.915 --> 01:57:25.418
Shadow and flame.

1069
01:57:28.755 --> 01:57:31.424
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1070
01:57:36.137 --> 01:57:38.265
We cannot stay here!

1071
01:57:38.431 --> 01:57:41.268
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1072
01:57:41.434 --> 01:57:43.144
Frodo?

1073
01:57:46.147 --> 01:57:49.025
We will go through the mines.

1074
01:57:49.776 --> 01:57:51.653
So be it.

1075
01:57:58.285 --> 01:58:02.247
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1076
01:58:05.792 --> 01:58:07.961
How is your shoulder?

1077
01:58:08.169 --> 01:58:11.464
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1078
01:58:12.966 --> 01:58:15.468
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1079
01:58:15.969 --> 01:58:18.888
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1080
01:58:19.306 --> 01:58:23.226
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the fellowship.

1081
01:58:23.393 --> 01:58:25.979
And, I fear, from within.

1082
01:58:28.648 --> 01:58:32.819
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1083
01:58:32.986 --> 01:58:35.822
Trust your own strengths.

1084
01:58:35.989 --> 01:58:38.575
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1085
01:58:38.783 --> 01:58:40.827
For good or for evil.

1086
01:58:40.994 --> 01:58:43.330
Some are greater than I am.

1087
01:58:43.830 --> 01:58:47.500
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1088
01:58:48.835 --> 01:58:50.211
The walls...

1089
01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:53.006
Of Moria.

1090
01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:01.723
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1091
01:59:01.931 --> 01:59:06.353
Gandalf: Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1092
01:59:06.728 --> 01:59:09.230
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1093
01:59:17.238 --> 01:59:20.533
Well, let's see.

1094
01:59:22.744 --> 01:59:26.122
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1095
01:59:40.178 --> 01:59:44.265
It reads, "the doors of Durin,
lord of Moria.

1096
01:59:44.849 --> 01:59:49.479
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1097
01:59:49.729 --> 01:59:54.484
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1098
02:00:18.258 --> 02:00:19.384
Nothing's happening.

1099
02:00:26.391 --> 02:00:30.603
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of elves...

1100
02:00:30.937 --> 02:00:33.773
Men and orcs.

1101
02:00:34.023 --> 02:00:35.275
What are you going to do, then?

1102
02:00:35.442 --> 02:00:37.694
Knock your head against these doors,
peregrin took!

1103
02:00:37.944 --> 02:00:39.946
And if that does not shatter them...

1104
02:00:40.113 --> 02:00:42.824
And I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1105
02:00:42.991 --> 02:00:46.453
I will try to find the opening words.

1106
02:00:59.299 --> 02:01:01.843
Mines are no place for a pony.

1107
02:01:02.051 --> 02:01:06.139
- Even one so brave as bill.
- Bye-bye, bill.

1108
02:01:07.307 --> 02:01:10.143
Go on, bill. Go on.

1109
02:01:10.643 --> 02:01:14.189
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1110
02:01:20.987 --> 02:01:23.573
Do not disturb the water.

1111
02:01:23.823 --> 02:01:25.658
Oh, it's useless.

1112
02:01:43.259 --> 02:01:46.387
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1113
02:01:46.763 --> 02:01:49.682
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1114
02:02:10.537 --> 02:02:15.375
Gimli: Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1115
02:02:15.875 --> 02:02:21.548
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1116
02:02:23.049 --> 02:02:26.135
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin balin.

1117
02:02:26.511 --> 02:02:28.888
And they call it a mine.

1118
02:02:29.097 --> 02:02:31.057
A mine!

1119
02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:35.436
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1120
02:02:39.732 --> 02:02:41.150
Gimli:

1121
02:02:48.741 --> 02:02:50.243
Goblins.

1122
02:02:54.163 --> 02:02:58.459
We make for the gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1123
02:02:59.544 --> 02:03:02.088
Aragorn:
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1124
02:03:04.924 --> 02:03:07.260
Merry: Frodo! Frodo: Help!

1125
02:03:07.468 --> 02:03:09.095
Strider!

1126
02:03:09.262 --> 02:03:12.098
Frodo: Help! Sam: Get off him!

1127
02:03:12.265 --> 02:03:13.266
Aragorn!

1128
02:03:25.945 --> 02:03:27.488
Strider!

1129
02:03:51.095 --> 02:03:52.138
Into the mines!

1130
02:03:52.305 --> 02:03:55.516
- Legolas!
- Aragorn: Into the cave!

1131
02:04:18.498 --> 02:04:22.043
Gandalf:
We now have but one choice.

1132
02:04:22.251 --> 02:04:27.173
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1133
02:04:27.382 --> 02:04:29.342
Be on your guard.

1134
02:04:29.550 --> 02:04:33.012
There are older
and fouler things than orcs...

1135
02:04:33.179 --> 02:04:36.724
In the deep places of the world.

1136
02:04:44.691 --> 02:04:48.653
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1137
02:04:48.861 --> 02:04:52.699
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1138
02:05:38.453 --> 02:05:42.165
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1139
02:05:42.331 --> 02:05:44.751
Orjewels...

1140
02:05:44.917 --> 02:05:47.962
But mithril.

1141
02:06:06.314 --> 02:06:11.235
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1142
02:06:11.444 --> 02:06:15.448
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1143
02:06:15.615 --> 02:06:17.492
I never told him...

1144
02:06:17.658 --> 02:06:22.622
But its worth was greater than
the value of the shire.

1145
02:06:34.967 --> 02:06:36.677
Pippin.

1146
02:06:57.365 --> 02:06:59.992
I have no memory of this place.

1147
02:07:02.078 --> 02:07:03.579
Pippin: Are we lost? Merry: No.

1148
02:07:03.788 --> 02:07:06.290
Pippin: I think we are.
Merry: Gandalf's thinking.

1149
02:07:06.499 --> 02:07:07.917
Pippin: Merry? Merry: What?

1150
02:07:08.209 --> 02:07:10.169
Pippin: I'm hungry.

1151
02:07:21.472 --> 02:07:25.935
- There's something down there.
- It's gollum.

1152
02:07:26.144 --> 02:07:30.273
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1153
02:07:30.481 --> 02:07:34.652
- He escaped the dungeons of barad-dur?
- Escaped...

1154
02:07:35.319 --> 02:07:36.988
Or was set loose.

1155
02:07:37.488 --> 02:07:41.159
Now the ring has brought him here.

1156
02:07:43.786 --> 02:07:46.539
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1157
02:07:46.706 --> 02:07:52.461
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1158
02:07:52.628 --> 02:07:57.508
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1159
02:07:57.675 --> 02:08:03.639
Yes, sméagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1160
02:08:04.557 --> 02:08:07.351
Before it drove him mad.

1161
02:08:07.643 --> 02:08:10.521
It's a pity bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1162
02:08:10.688 --> 02:08:11.898
Pity?

1163
02:08:12.982 --> 02:08:15.860
It is pity that stayed bilbo's hand.

1164
02:08:16.777 --> 02:08:21.991
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1165
02:08:23.409 --> 02:08:25.912
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1166
02:08:28.331 --> 02:08:32.293
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1167
02:08:32.501 --> 02:08:35.421
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1168
02:08:36.005 --> 02:08:41.928
My heart tells me that gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1169
02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:45.556
Before this is over.

1170
02:08:47.058 --> 02:08:50.937
The pity of bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1171
02:08:57.568 --> 02:09:00.947
I wish the ring
had never come to me.

1172
02:09:02.365 --> 02:09:04.408
I wish none of this had happened.

1173
02:09:04.575 --> 02:09:09.622
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1174
02:09:10.456 --> 02:09:15.962
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1175
02:09:17.463 --> 02:09:21.467
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1176
02:09:21.842 --> 02:09:24.262
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1177
02:09:24.762 --> 02:09:29.100
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1178
02:09:29.267 --> 02:09:32.478
And that is an encouraging thought.

1179
02:09:35.398 --> 02:09:36.565
Ah!

1180
02:09:37.358 --> 02:09:39.277
It's that way.

1181
02:09:39.485 --> 02:09:41.779
He's remembered. Gandalf: No.

1182
02:09:41.988 --> 02:09:45.783
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1183
02:09:45.992 --> 02:09:51.163
If in doubt, meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1184
02:10:06.012 --> 02:10:10.141
Let me risk a little more light.

1185
02:10:17.315 --> 02:10:22.528
The great realm
and dwarf-city of dwarrowdelf.

1186
02:10:25.031 --> 02:10:28.451
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1187
02:10:53.351 --> 02:10:55.061
Gimli!

1188
02:11:06.697 --> 02:11:09.867
Oh, no.

1189
02:11:20.252 --> 02:11:22.254
Gandalf: "Here lies balin...

1190
02:11:22.713 --> 02:11:24.715
Son of fundin...

1191
02:11:25.049 --> 02:11:27.676
Lord of Moria."

1192
02:11:28.719 --> 02:11:30.388
He is dead, then.

1193
02:11:32.556 --> 02:11:33.766
It's as I feared.

1194
02:11:52.076 --> 02:11:54.995
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1195
02:11:55.204 --> 02:11:59.917
Gandalf: "They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1196
02:12:01.001 --> 02:12:03.587
We have barred the gates...

1197
02:12:04.255 --> 02:12:06.757
But cannot hold them for long.

1198
02:12:06.924 --> 02:12:09.760
The ground shakes.

1199
02:12:10.136 --> 02:12:11.762
Drums...

1200
02:12:12.138 --> 02:12:15.516
Drums in the deep.

1201
02:12:19.061 --> 02:12:21.105
We cannot get out.

1202
02:12:23.107 --> 02:12:26.944
A shadow moves in the dark.

1203
02:12:28.612 --> 02:12:31.157
We cannot get out.

1204
02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:36.120
They are coming."

1205
02:13:19.163 --> 02:13:20.998
Fool of a took!

1206
02:13:21.332 --> 02:13:25.169
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1207
02:13:51.111 --> 02:13:52.738
Sam: Frodo!

1208
02:13:55.032 --> 02:13:56.534
Orcs.

1209
02:14:03.582 --> 02:14:05.584
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1210
02:14:12.841 --> 02:14:14.635
They have a cave-troll.

1211
02:14:30.442 --> 02:14:31.610
Let them come!

1212
02:14:32.111 --> 02:14:35.656
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1213
02:16:54.545 --> 02:16:57.297
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1214
02:17:37.254 --> 02:17:39.089
Frodo: Aragorn! Aragorn!

1215
02:19:29.241 --> 02:19:30.576
Oh, no.

1216
02:19:38.959 --> 02:19:40.836
He's alive.

1217
02:19:43.255 --> 02:19:46.258
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1218
02:19:46.592 --> 02:19:48.760
You should be dead.

1219
02:19:48.969 --> 02:19:51.471
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1220
02:19:51.722 --> 02:19:56.476
I think there's more to this hobbit
than meets the eye.

1221
02:20:06.194 --> 02:20:08.780
You are full of surprises,
master Baggins.

1222
02:20:14.786 --> 02:20:16.747
To the bridge of khazad-dum!

1223
02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:33.305
Aragorn: This way!

1224
02:21:43.709 --> 02:21:46.712
What is this new devilry?

1225
02:22:02.811 --> 02:22:05.605
A balrog.

1226
02:22:05.897 --> 02:22:09.067
A demon of the ancient world.

1227
02:22:11.236 --> 02:22:13.697
This foe is beyond any of you.

1228
02:22:23.749 --> 02:22:25.250
Quickly!

1229
02:22:43.769 --> 02:22:45.395
Lead them on, aragorn.

1230
02:22:46.772 --> 02:22:49.274
The bridge is near.

1231
02:22:51.359 --> 02:22:55.447
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1232
02:23:44.621 --> 02:23:45.831
Boromir: Merry! Pippin!

1233
02:24:01.221 --> 02:24:04.474
Nobody tosses a dwarf.

1234
02:24:22.159 --> 02:24:24.035
Steady.

1235
02:24:48.894 --> 02:24:50.061
Hang on!

1236
02:25:00.864 --> 02:25:02.574
Lean forward!

1237
02:25:05.577 --> 02:25:06.578
Steady.

1238
02:25:07.913 --> 02:25:09.080
Come on!

1239
02:25:28.058 --> 02:25:29.851
Over the bridge!

1240
02:25:30.101 --> 02:25:31.603
Fly!

1241
02:26:16.314 --> 02:26:18.316
You cannot pass!

1242
02:26:24.364 --> 02:26:29.244
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of anor.

1243
02:26:30.245 --> 02:26:33.999
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of udun!

1244
02:26:44.009 --> 02:26:46.011
Go back to the shadow.

1245
02:26:53.852 --> 02:26:58.273
You shall not pass!

1246
02:27:25.425 --> 02:27:29.304
- Boromir: No! No!
- Gandalf!

1247
02:27:36.978 --> 02:27:39.439
Fly, you fools!

1248
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:54.079
Aragorn!

1249
02:28:51.302 --> 02:28:54.139
Legolas, get them up.

1250
02:28:58.268 --> 02:29:00.103
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1251
02:29:00.270 --> 02:29:03.898
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with orcs.

1252
02:29:04.107 --> 02:29:07.444
We must reach the woods of lothlorien.

1253
02:29:08.319 --> 02:29:11.656
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1254
02:29:13.158 --> 02:29:15.326
On your feet, Sam.

1255
02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:17.162
Frodo?

1256
02:30:13.468 --> 02:30:16.012
Stay close, young hobbits!

1257
02:30:16.721 --> 02:30:20.892
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1258
02:30:21.100 --> 02:30:23.645
An elf-witch...

1259
02:30:24.187 --> 02:30:27.065
Of terrible power.

1260
02:30:27.607 --> 02:30:29.817
All who look upon her...

1261
02:30:30.026 --> 02:30:31.819
Fall under her spell.

1262
02:30:32.028 --> 02:30:33.321
Female voice: Frodo!

1263
02:30:35.573 --> 02:30:37.617
And are never seen again.

1264
02:30:37.825 --> 02:30:42.330
Female voice: Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

1265
02:30:42.539 --> 02:30:46.251
You bring great evil here,
ring-bearer.

1266
02:30:46.417 --> 02:30:48.211
Sam: Mr. Frodo?

1267
02:30:53.508 --> 02:30:59.097
Well, here's one dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1268
02:30:59.264 --> 02:31:03.851
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1269
02:31:11.526 --> 02:31:16.114
The dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1270
02:31:34.257 --> 02:31:36.551
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the elves!

1271
02:31:36.718 --> 02:31:38.636
Speak words we can all understand!

1272
02:31:38.803 --> 02:31:43.391
We have not had dealings
with the dwarves since the dark days.

1273
02:31:43.641 --> 02:31:46.185
And you know what this dwarf
says to that?

1274
02:31:53.109 --> 02:31:55.069
That was not so courteous.

1275
02:32:01.618 --> 02:32:05.663
You bring great evil with you.

1276
02:32:07.415 --> 02:32:09.626
You can go no further.

1277
02:32:46.871 --> 02:32:49.540
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1278
02:32:50.667 --> 02:32:52.543
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1279
02:32:54.045 --> 02:32:57.382
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1280
02:32:58.257 --> 02:33:01.386
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1281
02:33:04.347 --> 02:33:06.391
You will follow me.

1282
02:33:18.069 --> 02:33:20.071
Caras galadhon.

1283
02:33:20.697 --> 02:33:23.658
The heart of elvendom on earth.

1284
02:33:23.825 --> 02:33:29.497
Realm of the lord celeborn
and of Galadriel, lady of light.

1285
02:34:48.493 --> 02:34:51.621
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1286
02:34:52.288 --> 02:34:57.460
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1287
02:34:59.170 --> 02:35:03.633
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from rivendell.

1288
02:35:03.883 --> 02:35:05.676
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1289
02:35:05.885 --> 02:35:09.013
For I much desire to speak with him.

1290
02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:11.974
I can no longer see him from afar.

1291
02:35:12.850 --> 02:35:18.022
Galadriel: Gandalf the grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1292
02:35:18.272 --> 02:35:20.691
He has fallen into shadow.

1293
02:35:25.404 --> 02:35:29.909
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1294
02:35:31.536 --> 02:35:35.289
A balrog of morgoth.

1295
02:35:35.998 --> 02:35:39.377
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1296
02:35:41.504 --> 02:35:44.715
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1297
02:35:45.383 --> 02:35:48.678
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1298
02:35:53.432 --> 02:35:57.728
Do not let the great emptiness
of khazad-dum fill your heart...

1299
02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:00.356
Gimli, son of gléin.

1300
02:36:01.357 --> 02:36:04.902
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1301
02:36:06.362 --> 02:36:09.031
And in all lands...

1302
02:36:09.198 --> 02:36:12.702
Love is now mingled with grief.

1303
02:36:25.339 --> 02:36:28.050
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1304
02:36:28.593 --> 02:36:31.596
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1305
02:36:34.557 --> 02:36:37.852
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1306
02:36:38.019 --> 02:36:41.105
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1307
02:36:41.856 --> 02:36:44.692
To the ruin of all.

1308
02:36:49.030 --> 02:36:54.869
Yet hope remains
while the company is true.

1309
02:36:56.412 --> 02:37:01.125
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1310
02:37:01.584 --> 02:37:05.254
For you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1311
02:37:07.506 --> 02:37:09.634
Tonight, you will sleep...

1312
02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:13.220
Galadriel:
Welcome, Frodo of the shire...

1313
02:37:14.805 --> 02:37:16.599
One who has seen the eye!

1314
02:37:31.238 --> 02:37:33.824
A lament for Gandalf.

1315
02:37:41.082 --> 02:37:42.625
What do they say about him?

1316
02:37:42.833 --> 02:37:45.503
I have not the heart to tell you.

1317
02:37:48.255 --> 02:37:50.508
For me, the grief is still too near.

1318
02:37:53.469 --> 02:37:56.305
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1319
02:37:56.472 --> 02:37:59.517
There should be a verse about them.

1320
02:38:03.062 --> 02:38:05.064
The finest rockets ever seen

1321
02:38:06.190 --> 02:38:09.026
they burst in stars of blue and green

1322
02:38:09.944 --> 02:38:13.364
or after thunder, silver showers

1323
02:38:15.866 --> 02:38:18.661
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1324
02:38:18.828 --> 02:38:22.707
oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1325
02:38:33.551 --> 02:38:36.220
Aragorn: Take some rest.

1326
02:38:36.387 --> 02:38:39.098
These borders are well-protected.

1327
02:38:39.306 --> 02:38:41.851
I will find no rest here.

1328
02:38:44.687 --> 02:38:47.690
I heard her voice inside my head.

1329
02:38:47.898 --> 02:38:51.652
She spoke of my father
and the fall of gondor.

1330
02:38:51.861 --> 02:38:57.324
She said to me,
"even now there is hope left."

1331
02:38:58.701 --> 02:39:01.537
But I cannot see it.

1332
02:39:02.872 --> 02:39:05.374
It is long since we had any hope.

1333
02:39:15.551 --> 02:39:17.678
My father is a noble man.

1334
02:39:18.429 --> 02:39:20.681
But his rule is failing...

1335
02:39:21.015 --> 02:39:26.437
And our people lose faith.

1336
02:39:27.855 --> 02:39:31.400
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1337
02:39:31.567 --> 02:39:35.112
I would see the glory
of gondor restored.

1338
02:39:37.948 --> 02:39:40.951
Have you ever seen it, aragorn?

1339
02:39:41.577 --> 02:39:43.621
The white tower of ecthelion.

1340
02:39:43.788 --> 02:39:47.625
Glimmering like a spike
of Pearl and silver.

1341
02:39:48.292 --> 02:39:51.796
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1342
02:39:54.673 --> 02:39:56.634
Have you ever been called home...

1343
02:39:56.801 --> 02:40:00.763
By the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1344
02:40:01.388 --> 02:40:04.642
I have seen the white city...

1345
02:40:04.975 --> 02:40:06.477
Long ago.

1346
02:40:07.436 --> 02:40:12.399
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1347
02:40:13.317 --> 02:40:16.278
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1348
02:40:16.737 --> 02:40:20.074
"The lords of gondor have returned."

1349
02:41:27.266 --> 02:41:29.810
Will you look into the mirror?

1350
02:41:29.977 --> 02:41:31.520
What will I see?

1351
02:41:34.481 --> 02:41:36.817
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1352
02:41:37.735 --> 02:41:39.570
For the mirror...

1353
02:41:39.778 --> 02:41:42.323
Shows many things.

1354
02:41:45.326 --> 02:41:47.703
Things that were...

1355
02:41:47.912 --> 02:41:50.497
Things that are...

1356
02:41:51.248 --> 02:41:53.209
And some things...

1357
02:41:56.795 --> 02:42:00.090
That have not yet come to pass.

1358
02:43:22.673 --> 02:43:25.509
I know what it is you saw.

1359
02:43:27.928 --> 02:43:30.431
For it is also in my mind.

1360
02:43:32.182 --> 02:43:36.270
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

1361
02:43:38.647 --> 02:43:43.527
The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1362
02:43:44.153 --> 02:43:47.448
He will try to take the ring.

1363
02:43:47.656 --> 02:43:49.658
You know of whom I speak.

1364
02:43:50.659 --> 02:43:55.331
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1365
02:43:56.832 --> 02:43:59.293
Frodo: If you ask it of me...

1366
02:43:59.668 --> 02:44:02.713
I will give you the one ring.

1367
02:44:03.797 --> 02:44:05.966
You offer it to me freely.

1368
02:44:10.554 --> 02:44:14.475
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1369
02:44:20.856 --> 02:44:24.151
In place of a dark lord,
you would have a queen...

1370
02:44:24.568 --> 02:44:28.405
Not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1371
02:44:29.031 --> 02:44:32.076
Treacherous as the sea!

1372
02:44:32.576 --> 02:44:37.498
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1373
02:44:37.956 --> 02:44:40.334
All shall love me...

1374
02:44:40.542 --> 02:44:43.379
And despair.

1375
02:44:57.476 --> 02:45:01.772
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1376
02:45:02.064 --> 02:45:04.525
And go into the west...

1377
02:45:04.733 --> 02:45:09.196
- And remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1378
02:45:12.783 --> 02:45:16.954
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1379
02:45:17.871 --> 02:45:19.373
Is to be alone.

1380
02:45:22.709 --> 02:45:25.462
This is nenya,
the ring of adamant.

1381
02:45:25.629 --> 02:45:27.256
And I am its keeper.

1382
02:45:30.467 --> 02:45:34.096
This task was appointed to you.

1383
02:45:35.139 --> 02:45:38.016
And if you do not find a way...

1384
02:45:39.226 --> 02:45:41.228
No one will.

1385
02:45:41.603 --> 02:45:44.773
Then I know what I must do.

1386
02:45:45.441 --> 02:45:46.650
It's just...

1387
02:45:49.903 --> 02:45:52.156
I'm afraid to do it.

1388
02:45:55.659 --> 02:46:00.789
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1389
02:46:06.128 --> 02:46:11.842
Do you know how the orcs
first came into being?

1390
02:46:12.634 --> 02:46:15.971
They were elves once.

1391
02:46:17.139 --> 02:46:20.476
Taken by the dark powers...

1392
02:46:20.684 --> 02:46:23.854
Tortured and mutilated.

1393
02:46:24.188 --> 02:46:29.485
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1394
02:46:29.776 --> 02:46:31.612
And now...

1395
02:46:33.071 --> 02:46:34.948
Perfected.

1396
02:46:35.657 --> 02:46:38.827
My fighting uruk-hai...

1397
02:46:40.787 --> 02:46:43.123
Whom do you serve?

1398
02:46:43.332 --> 02:46:45.834
Saruman!

1399
02:47:06.688 --> 02:47:10.150
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1400
02:47:10.359 --> 02:47:13.237
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1401
02:47:13.487 --> 02:47:16.406
You will taste man-flesh!

1402
02:47:21.495 --> 02:47:25.207
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1403
02:47:25.374 --> 02:47:29.545
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1404
02:47:51.858 --> 02:47:57.281
Celeborn: Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1405
02:47:58.407 --> 02:48:02.244
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1406
02:48:09.418 --> 02:48:10.961
Lembas.

1407
02:48:11.211 --> 02:48:12.796
Elvish waybread.

1408
02:48:15.299 --> 02:48:18.302
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1409
02:48:24.808 --> 02:48:26.768
How many did you eat?

1410
02:48:26.935 --> 02:48:28.604
Foun

1411
02:48:34.401 --> 02:48:37.001
Celeborn: Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1412
02:48:37.195 --> 02:48:41.325
Mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the anduin.

1413
02:48:41.491 --> 02:48:43.994
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

1414
02:48:44.202 --> 02:48:47.998
Strange creatures bearing the white hand
have been seen on our borders.

1415
02:48:48.206 --> 02:48:53.295
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1416
02:49:05.891 --> 02:49:07.368
By river you have the chance...

1417
02:49:07.392 --> 02:49:10.604
Of outrunning the enemy
to the falls of rauros.

1418
02:49:27.871 --> 02:49:32.709
Galadriel: My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the galadhrim.

1419
02:49:32.959 --> 02:49:36.463
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1420
02:49:41.843 --> 02:49:44.304
These are the daggers of the noldorin.

1421
02:49:44.471 --> 02:49:48.475
They have already seen service in war.

1422
02:49:48.642 --> 02:49:50.894
Do not fear, young peregrin took.

1423
02:49:51.061 --> 02:49:54.398
You will find your courage.

1424
02:49:56.274 --> 02:49:58.235
And for you, samwise gamgee...

1425
02:49:58.402 --> 02:50:00.987
Elven rope made of hithlain.

1426
02:50:01.154 --> 02:50:03.281
Thank you, my lady.

1427
02:50:05.075 --> 02:50:08.412
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1428
02:50:14.876 --> 02:50:17.921
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the elves?

1429
02:50:18.088 --> 02:50:20.215
Nothing.

1430
02:50:20.841 --> 02:50:24.177
Except to look upon the lady
of the galadhrim one last time...

1431
02:50:24.803 --> 02:50:30.016
For she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1432
02:50:37.065 --> 02:50:38.608
Actually...

1433
02:50:38.817 --> 02:50:40.444
There was one thing.

1434
02:50:41.278 --> 02:50:43.947
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1435
02:50:44.114 --> 02:50:46.908
Stupid to ask.

1436
02:50:49.453 --> 02:50:51.580
Galadriel:
I have nothing greater to give...

1437
02:50:51.747 --> 02:50:55.333
Than the gift you already bear.

1438
02:51:20.984 --> 02:51:24.070
That choice is yet before her.

1439
02:51:24.654 --> 02:51:27.574
You have your own choice to make,
aragorn.

1440
02:51:27.908 --> 02:51:33.747
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of elendil...

1441
02:51:33.914 --> 02:51:38.251
Or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1442
02:52:05.821 --> 02:52:09.032
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1443
02:52:09.199 --> 02:52:12.619
I give you the light of earendil...

1444
02:52:13.370 --> 02:52:15.705
Our most beloved star.

1445
02:52:24.840 --> 02:52:29.219
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

1446
02:52:29.469 --> 02:52:33.557
When all other lights go out.

1447
02:52:42.399 --> 02:52:45.569
Gimli: I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1448
02:52:46.194 --> 02:52:50.490
Having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1449
02:52:51.241 --> 02:52:54.578
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1450
02:52:54.828 --> 02:52:56.746
What was her gift?

1451
02:52:56.955 --> 02:53:01.877
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1452
02:53:02.669 --> 02:53:05.547
She gave me three.

1453
02:54:47.691 --> 02:54:51.152
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1454
02:54:54.864 --> 02:54:57.993
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1455
02:54:58.201 --> 02:55:01.371
But he's too clever a waterman.

1456
02:55:02.205 --> 02:55:05.542
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1457
02:55:05.709 --> 02:55:07.961
It will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1458
02:55:08.128 --> 02:55:10.213
Sam: Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1459
02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:13.466
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1460
02:55:13.633 --> 02:55:16.720
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1461
02:55:17.679 --> 02:55:20.682
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

1462
02:55:20.849 --> 02:55:22.017
But you're not.

1463
02:55:22.308 --> 02:55:24.811
I'm here to help you.

1464
02:55:24.978 --> 02:55:26.688
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1465
02:55:32.652 --> 02:55:35.405
You can't help me, Sam.

1466
02:55:42.162 --> 02:55:44.247
Get some sleep.

1467
02:55:50.503 --> 02:55:52.714
Minas tirith is the safer road.

1468
02:55:53.256 --> 02:55:56.009
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1469
02:55:56.676 --> 02:55:58.928
Strike out for mordor from a place
of strength.

1470
02:55:59.262 --> 02:56:02.140
There is no strength in gondor
that can avail us.

1471
02:56:02.599 --> 02:56:04.601
You were quick enough to trust
the elves.

1472
02:56:06.436 --> 02:56:09.272
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1473
02:56:09.439 --> 02:56:12.442
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1474
02:56:12.650 --> 02:56:15.945
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1475
02:56:16.196 --> 02:56:18.406
But you will not see that.

1476
02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:20.158
You are afraid!

1477
02:56:20.408 --> 02:56:22.952
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1478
02:56:23.244 --> 02:56:26.706
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1479
02:56:29.125 --> 02:56:33.463
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1480
02:56:45.308 --> 02:56:46.684
Frodo.

1481
02:56:48.561 --> 02:56:50.063
The argonath.

1482
02:56:53.483 --> 02:56:57.237
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1483
02:56:57.987 --> 02:56:59.906
My kin.

1484
02:58:18.902 --> 02:58:21.070
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1485
02:58:21.321 --> 02:58:23.907
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1486
02:58:24.073 --> 02:58:27.577
- We approach mordor from the north.
- Oh, yes?

1487
02:58:27.994 --> 02:58:31.831
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through emyn muil...

1488
02:58:31.998 --> 02:58:35.251
An impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1489
02:58:35.418 --> 02:58:38.546
And after that, it gets even better.

1490
02:58:38.922 --> 02:58:43.885
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1491
02:58:44.052 --> 02:58:45.428
That is our road.

1492
02:58:47.013 --> 02:58:50.225
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, master dwarf.

1493
02:58:50.433 --> 02:58:52.185
Recover my...

1494
02:58:55.188 --> 02:58:57.190
- We should leave now.
- No.

1495
02:58:57.357 --> 02:59:01.819
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1496
02:59:02.028 --> 02:59:05.448
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1497
02:59:05.698 --> 02:59:09.702
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1498
02:59:10.203 --> 02:59:14.374
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1499
02:59:16.376 --> 02:59:21.339
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1500
02:59:21.839 --> 02:59:23.549
Where's Frodo?

1501
02:59:49.158 --> 02:59:51.077
Boromir:
None of us should wander alone.

1502
02:59:52.495 --> 02:59:54.580
You, least of all.

1503
02:59:54.789 --> 02:59:57.250
So much depends on you.

1504
02:59:58.293 --> 03:00:00.253
Frodo?

1505
03:00:07.385 --> 03:00:09.929
I know why you seek solitude.

1506
03:00:10.638 --> 03:00:14.100
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1507
03:00:14.892 --> 03:00:17.937
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1508
03:00:19.522 --> 03:00:22.150
There are other ways, Frodo.

1509
03:00:22.400 --> 03:00:26.195
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1510
03:00:26.446 --> 03:00:30.199
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1511
03:00:30.450 --> 03:00:33.536
Warning? Against what?

1512
03:00:33.703 --> 03:00:35.830
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1513
03:00:36.039 --> 03:00:39.667
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1514
03:00:39.917 --> 03:00:43.671
- Don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1515
03:00:45.465 --> 03:00:48.801
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1516
03:00:50.345 --> 03:00:52.430
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1517
03:00:53.639 --> 03:00:57.310
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1518
03:00:59.145 --> 03:01:02.482
What chance do you think you have?

1519
03:01:02.648 --> 03:01:07.320
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1520
03:01:07.570 --> 03:01:11.240
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1521
03:01:13.368 --> 03:01:15.495
You fool!

1522
03:01:15.661 --> 03:01:19.665
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1523
03:01:19.832 --> 03:01:22.668
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1524
03:01:22.835 --> 03:01:24.170
- Give it to me!
- No!

1525
03:01:24.337 --> 03:01:26.172
- Give it to me!
- No.

1526
03:01:33.846 --> 03:01:35.848
I see your mind.

1527
03:01:36.099 --> 03:01:39.018
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1528
03:01:39.227 --> 03:01:41.104
You will betray us!

1529
03:01:41.354 --> 03:01:44.524
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1530
03:01:44.982 --> 03:01:48.611
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1531
03:01:55.701 --> 03:01:57.203
Frodo?

1532
03:02:01.541 --> 03:02:03.126
Frodo.

1533
03:02:07.046 --> 03:02:09.048
What have I done?

1534
03:02:09.257 --> 03:02:11.008
Please, Frodo.

1535
03:02:11.217 --> 03:02:13.886
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1536
03:03:02.435 --> 03:03:03.853
Frodo?

1537
03:03:05.104 --> 03:03:08.191
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1538
03:03:08.441 --> 03:03:10.193
Stay away!

1539
03:03:14.447 --> 03:03:18.284
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1540
03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:30.463
Would you destroy it?

1541
03:03:35.468 --> 03:03:37.386
Voice of the ring: Aragorn.

1542
03:03:40.806 --> 03:03:43.142
Aragorn.

1543
03:03:44.977 --> 03:03:46.812
Elessar.

1544
03:03:54.487 --> 03:03:57.823
I would have gone with you to the end.

1545
03:03:58.491 --> 03:04:01.327
Into the very fires of mordor.

1546
03:04:04.664 --> 03:04:05.831
I know.

1547
03:04:08.334 --> 03:04:13.756
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1548
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:19.262
Go, Frodo!

1549
03:05:01.178 --> 03:05:02.930
Find the halfling!

1550
03:05:04.557 --> 03:05:07.101
Find the halfling!

1551
03:05:18.738 --> 03:05:20.323
Aragorn, go!

1552
03:05:42.011 --> 03:05:43.346
Pippin: Frodo!

1553
03:05:43.929 --> 03:05:45.514
Hide here. Quick!

1554
03:05:46.140 --> 03:05:47.600
Come on!

1555
03:05:50.102 --> 03:05:52.104
What's he doing?

1556
03:05:56.359 --> 03:05:58.361
He's leaving.

1557
03:06:10.956 --> 03:06:13.292
Merry: Run, Frodo. Go on!

1558
03:06:13.876 --> 03:06:16.962
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1559
03:06:17.380 --> 03:06:18.964
- Over here!
- This way!

1560
03:06:29.809 --> 03:06:32.144
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1561
03:07:27.533 --> 03:07:30.578
- The horn of gondor.
- Boromir.

1562
03:11:51.839 --> 03:11:54.883
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1563
03:11:55.217 --> 03:11:57.302
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1564
03:11:59.179 --> 03:12:00.597
I let Frodo go.

1565
03:12:01.306 --> 03:12:03.892
Then you did what I could not.

1566
03:12:04.893 --> 03:12:08.230
I tried to take the ring from him.

1567
03:12:08.731 --> 03:12:13.027
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1568
03:12:13.235 --> 03:12:15.529
I did not see it.

1569
03:12:15.738 --> 03:12:18.907
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1570
03:12:19.366 --> 03:12:21.910
You fought bravely.

1571
03:12:22.202 --> 03:12:24.872
You have kept your honor.

1572
03:12:25.414 --> 03:12:27.374
Boromir: Leaveit

1573
03:12:27.708 --> 03:12:29.752
it is over.

1574
03:12:30.919 --> 03:12:36.216
The world of men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1575
03:12:36.633 --> 03:12:39.636
And my city to ruin.

1576
03:12:43.724 --> 03:12:46.435
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1577
03:12:46.602 --> 03:12:50.606
But I swear to you,
I will not let the white city fall...

1578
03:12:51.607 --> 03:12:54.109
Nor our people fail.

1579
03:12:55.110 --> 03:12:56.445
Our people.

1580
03:13:00.282 --> 03:13:02.409
Our people.

1581
03:13:24.139 --> 03:13:27.142
I would have followed you, my brother.

1582
03:13:28.685 --> 03:13:30.687
My captain.

1583
03:13:33.315 --> 03:13:35.275
My king.

1584
03:13:54.920 --> 03:13:57.172
Be at peace...

1585
03:13:57.506 --> 03:13:59.508
Son of gondor.

1586
03:14:16.024 --> 03:14:19.361
They will look for his coming
from the white tower.

1587
03:14:19.862 --> 03:14:22.865
But he will not return.

1588
03:15:07.534 --> 03:15:10.787
Frodo:
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1589
03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:15.083
I wish none of this had happened.

1590
03:15:18.045 --> 03:15:20.797
Gandalf: So do all who live
to see such times...

1591
03:15:21.006 --> 03:15:24.426
But that is not for them to decide.

1592
03:15:24.593 --> 03:15:27.262
All you have to decide...

1593
03:15:27.512 --> 03:15:32.267
Is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1594
03:16:01.088 --> 03:16:03.131
Frodo, no!

1595
03:16:05.801 --> 03:16:08.470
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1596
03:16:11.974 --> 03:16:13.976
Go back, Sam!

1597
03:16:14.476 --> 03:16:18.063
- I'm going to mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1598
03:16:18.272 --> 03:16:21.108
And I'm coming with you!

1599
03:16:21.566 --> 03:16:23.986
You can't swim!

1600
03:17:17.331 --> 03:17:20.042
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1601
03:17:20.375 --> 03:17:24.713
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, samwise gamgee."

1602
03:17:25.839 --> 03:17:28.425
And I don't mean to.

1603
03:17:28.717 --> 03:17:30.886
I don't mean to.

1604
03:17:49.237 --> 03:17:50.906
Come on.

1605
03:18:19.393 --> 03:18:23.939
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1606
03:18:38.787 --> 03:18:43.792
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1607
03:18:47.254 --> 03:18:52.134
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1608
03:19:03.979 --> 03:19:07.149
Not if we hold true to each other.

1609
03:19:08.483 --> 03:19:12.988
We will not abandon merry and pippin
to torment and death.

1610
03:19:13.989 --> 03:19:19.244
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1611
03:19:20.495 --> 03:19:22.539
We travel light.

1612
03:19:22.747 --> 03:19:24.666
Let us hunt some orc.

1613
03:19:48.648 --> 03:19:50.066
Frodo: Mordor.

1614
03:19:50.692 --> 03:19:54.070
I hope the others find a safer road.

1615
03:19:55.030 --> 03:19:57.574
Strider will look after them.

1616
03:19:58.533 --> 03:20:01.870
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1617
03:20:02.204 --> 03:20:04.664
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1618
03:20:04.873 --> 03:20:06.374
We may.

1619
03:20:13.173 --> 03:20:15.800
I'm glad you are with me.
