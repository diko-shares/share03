00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.048
Mayday! Mayday!

3
00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:22.917
This is the crawler Annabelle. I've lost
my bearings and I'm taking on water.

4
00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:27.590
My last good reading is
44 degrees north, 68 degrees...

5
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.965
Portland Station to Annabelle.
What is your current position?

6
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:36.247
I don't know exactly, Portland.

7
00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:39.176
Off the coast somewhere,
near Rockwell! Wait.

8
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:41.507
The lighthouse! I see it!

9
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:03.654
Over here, honey!

10
00:03:06.865 --> 00:03:09.494
Hey, Mom!
You won't believe our good luck.

11
00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:10.863
Guess what I found?

12
00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:13.096
Hogarth, we've been through this before.

13
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.534
No pets.

14
00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:16.265
Oh, but he's not a pet, Mom.

15
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:17.534
He's a friend.

16
00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.439
Hogarth, we've got
to rent a room this year

17
00:03:19.611 --> 00:03:20.811
if we're gonna make ends meet,

18
00:03:20.912 --> 00:03:23.000
and no one wants to live in a place
with shredded upholstery.

19
00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:25.176
You'll never know he's there.
I'll keep him in a cage.

20
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.946
Until you feel sorry for him
and set him free in the house!

21
00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:31.386
Do you remember
the raccoon, Hogarth?

22
00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:34.048
Ugh... I remember the raccoon.

23
00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:37.196
Please, Mom, at least look at him.

24
00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:40.628
Oh, all right, all right.
Where is this guy?

25
00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.064
Annie,
I can't read this handwriting.

26
00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:46.103
Yeah, that one, that one should
have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo.

27
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:49.730
I will go get him, okay?

28
00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.635
So he wants us to hold
the mayo and the mustard.

29
00:03:53.812 --> 00:03:56.646
How about just hold the flavor altogether?

30
00:04:02.954 --> 00:04:04.217
Excuse me.

31
00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.424
Excuse me. Sir?

32
00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:09.884
Sir?

33
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.154
Sir!

34
00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.093
Excuse me...

35
00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.269
- Huh? What's that?
- Please don't move, sir.

36
00:04:18.436 --> 00:04:21.133
My pet's under your table. Don't look!

37
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.266
If you make a scene,
my mom won't let me keep him.

38
00:04:24.442 --> 00:04:26.411
- What kind of pet, kid?
- A squirrel.

39
00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:27.818
But don't worry. He's friendly.

40
00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.972
I'm telling the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space.

41
00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:32.412
I saw it.

42
00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:35.486
And it was headed toward land.

43
00:04:35.654 --> 00:04:38.123
I called the government
in Washington about it.

44
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.783
May, maybe it was a Sputnik
or an invader from Mars.

45
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.021
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!

46
00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:48.759
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.

47
00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:52.632
Unidentified? Knowing you, Earl,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.

48
00:04:57.843 --> 00:05:00.472
Hey. I saw it, too.

49
00:05:02.814 --> 00:05:03.941
I rest my case.

50
00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.016
- Ah...
- I believe you.

51
00:05:10.488 --> 00:05:11.854
What if it is Sputnik?

52
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.187
Or a flying saucer from Mars?

53
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.885
I bet we could find it.

54
00:05:17.495 --> 00:05:20.226
Sorry, kid. I didn't really see anything.

55
00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:22.663
But if we don't stick up
for the kooks, who will?

56
00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:24.860
Is my son bothering you, sir?

57
00:05:26.805 --> 00:05:29.297
- Yes.
- No!

58
00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:30.999
Call me Dean.

59
00:05:32.043 --> 00:05:34.512
Uh, Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?

60
00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:35.738
I will, Mom.

61
00:05:35.914 --> 00:05:37.815
- Right after I finish talking with...
- Dean.

62
00:05:37.983 --> 00:05:40.179
Dean.

63
00:05:41.686 --> 00:05:43.678
- Found your pet.
- Where?

64
00:05:43.855 --> 00:05:44.914
It's up my leg, man.

65
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.685
Squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.

66
00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:48.918
Don't wig out.

67
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.595
Okay. He's heading north now.

68
00:05:52.364 --> 00:05:56.233
I'm sorry, kid. I'd like to apologize
to everyone in advance for this.

69
00:05:59.237 --> 00:06:00.535
Ooh!

70
00:06:02.941 --> 00:06:04.500
- Ah!
- Oh!

71
00:06:07.746 --> 00:06:09.237
Check, please.

72
00:06:09.748 --> 00:06:11.080
It's a rat!

73
00:06:16.888 --> 00:06:18.885
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling, please?

74
00:06:18.924 --> 00:06:22.053
Hogarth, honey,
I'm really sorry, but...

75
00:06:22.227 --> 00:06:23.456
Thank you.

76
00:06:23.628 --> 00:06:27.065
I need to work late tonight.
There's some cold chicken in the icebox.

77
00:06:27.232 --> 00:06:28.928
You can have that and

78
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.569
- some carrots...
- I'm way ahead of you, Mom.

79
00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:34.035
- Good. I'll make it up to you, okay?
- Okay.

80
00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:35.798
- I love you, honey.
- Me too.

81
00:06:35.974 --> 00:06:40.708
And, Hogarth, no scary movies,
no late snacks, in bed by 8:00. Got it?

82
00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.371
Come on, Mom. It's me, remember?

83
00:06:43.748 --> 00:06:47.241
Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Mullen.

84
00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:51.618
If we can transplant at least 15%
of their brain matter into ours,

85
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.259
we may be able to read minds.

86
00:06:56.394 --> 00:06:59.387
Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.

87
00:06:59.564 --> 00:07:02.625
I think you've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?

88
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:04.633
Let's say, my place.

89
00:07:04.803 --> 00:07:05.896
Oh, jeez.

90
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:09.473
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Mind reader.

91
00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:12.577
Darn. I seem to have left my keys
in the lab.

92
00:07:17.515 --> 00:07:19.074
Hmm.

93
00:07:22.153 --> 00:07:24.179
You're gonna get it.

94
00:07:32.964 --> 00:07:34.296
Who's there?

95
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:43.138
No. No. No!

96
00:07:49.647 --> 00:07:51.639
Oh, come on!

97
00:07:51.816 --> 00:07:53.341
Stupid antenna.

98
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.189
Invaders from Mars!

99
00:11:27.332 --> 00:11:28.925
Oh, Hogarth.

100
00:11:34.405 --> 00:11:35.668
Oh!

101
00:11:38.276 --> 00:11:39.869
Hogarth?

102
00:11:40.044 --> 00:11:41.171
Honey?

103
00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:49.251
Hey!

104
00:11:52.423 --> 00:11:54.255
Hogarth?

105
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.619
Hogarth!

106
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:40.298
Help! Help! Stop! Help!

107
00:13:45.837 --> 00:13:46.998
Hogarth?

108
00:13:47.372 --> 00:13:49.136
- Hogarth!
- Mom!

109
00:13:49.307 --> 00:13:50.547
What do you think you're doing?

110
00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:53.010
Don't you know better
than to wander off at night alone?

111
00:13:53.177 --> 00:13:54.537
What if something happened to you?

112
00:13:54.846 --> 00:13:56.405
I'm sorry, Mom.

113
00:13:56.681 --> 00:13:59.412
Oh, don't you ever do that
to me again, Hogarth.

114
00:13:59.584 --> 00:14:02.748
I was so scared. I thought I'd lost you.

115
00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:06.485
Mom, you won't believe this.

116
00:14:06.657 --> 00:14:08.922
Something ate our TV antenna.

117
00:14:10.528 --> 00:14:13.760
- Oh, Hogarth...
- No, no! I'm serious!

118
00:14:14.232 --> 00:14:15.996
Oh, but it's not Sputnik,
like Mr. Stutz thought.

119
00:14:16.167 --> 00:14:17.328
Hogarth...

120
00:14:17.502 --> 00:14:19.994
- No, it's a robot! No, really, it is!
- Hogarth... Hogarth...

121
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:22.902
- And the robot, it's 100 feet high!
- Please...

122
00:14:23.074 --> 00:14:24.838
- Hogarth!
- And it eats metal!

123
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:27.240
Stop it! Just...

124
00:14:27.412 --> 00:14:28.675
Stop.

125
00:14:29.247 --> 00:14:30.875
I'm not...

126
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.078
I'm not in the mood.

127
00:14:35.887 --> 00:14:38.254
Come on. Let's go home.

128
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.604
A peaceful stay-at-home
kind of day, in a town

129
00:14:58.776 --> 00:15:00.142
very much like your own.

130
00:15:00.311 --> 00:15:02.576
But then, suddenly
without warning...

131
00:15:04.148 --> 00:15:06.276
Atomic holocaust!

132
00:15:07.552 --> 00:15:09.384
But how does one survive
an atomic attack?

133
00:15:09.554 --> 00:15:11.614
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?

134
00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:13.985
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.

135
00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:16.059
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.

136
00:15:16.227 --> 00:15:18.128
No, no, no. It was a metal meteor.

137
00:15:18.296 --> 00:15:20.162
- It ate his boat. My dad says...
- Ah...

138
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:21.765
It wasn't any of those things.

139
00:15:21.933 --> 00:15:23.629
What would you know about it, poindexter?

140
00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:25.064
- Hogarth!
- Shh...

141
00:15:25.236 --> 00:15:27.000
Don't make me come over there.

142
00:15:36.013 --> 00:15:39.950
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it only eats metal.

143
00:15:40.117 --> 00:15:41.415
Shut up, you little spaz!

144
00:15:41.586 --> 00:15:44.750
It's probably been sent by foreign enemies
to take over the country.

145
00:15:44.922 --> 00:15:47.687
We should bomb it to smithereens
before it does.

146
00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:58.267
Why's a nice girl like you
serving coffee to a guy like me?

147
00:15:58.436 --> 00:16:02.339
Particularly when I have the right
to refuse service to anyone.

148
00:16:02.773 --> 00:16:05.538
I'm sorry about yesterday. I, uh...

149
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.940
I'm usually, hmm...

150
00:16:08.112 --> 00:16:09.307
Not like that?

151
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.813
Right.

152
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.845
Oh, it wasn't your fault.

153
00:16:14.318 --> 00:16:15.980
Hogarth just...

154
00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:18.614
I think he's lonely.

155
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.488
Yeah.

156
00:16:20.658 --> 00:16:22.820
Well, he's a good kid.

157
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:26.855
Hey, come on outside.

158
00:16:27.031 --> 00:16:28.226
I got something to show you.

159
00:16:30.301 --> 00:16:31.200
Thanks for the scrap, Floyd.

160
00:16:31.369 --> 00:16:34.134
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it, it's got this,

161
00:16:34.305 --> 00:16:37.742
um, this large bite out of it.

162
00:16:37.909 --> 00:16:41.505
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a large bite out of it.

163
00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:43.341
What could've done this?

164
00:16:43.514 --> 00:16:45.983
- I told you what.
- Oh, yeah.

165
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.643
Strange invaders.

166
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.018
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.

167
00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.991
Yeah. They're sending someone
to take care of the whole thing.

168
00:16:57.161 --> 00:16:59.602
Jeez, Earl. You really are crazy.

169
00:16:59.836 --> 00:17:02.104
I mean, who in the hell would
the government send?

170
00:17:05.503 --> 00:17:08.029
Kent Mansley, United States Government,
Unexplained Phenomena Department.

171
00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:09.935
- Marv Loach. I'm the coordinator.
- What happened here?

172
00:17:10.107 --> 00:17:14.169
Not sure. Sometimes the line'll snap
if the weather is bad, sure.

173
00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:15.404
But for a whole tower

174
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.175
to get twisted up like that, whoa!

175
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.513
It's got me beat.

176
00:17:20.885 --> 00:17:25.846
It's almost like it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.

177
00:17:26.023 --> 00:17:27.889
Enormous beast.

178
00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:30.426
Yeah, what do you think? Escaped gorilla?

179
00:17:30.595 --> 00:17:31.955
Uh, what department is that again?

180
00:17:32.063 --> 00:17:36.057
Frankly, I'm not at liberty to reveal the
particulars of the agency I work for

181
00:17:36.233 --> 00:17:37.724
and all that, that implies.

182
00:17:37.902 --> 00:17:40.303
You mean, uh, national security?

183
00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:41.803
Let's put it this way.

184
00:17:41.973 --> 00:17:43.202
Every once in a while, things happen

185
00:17:43.374 --> 00:17:46.970
that just can't be rationalized
in a conventional way.

186
00:17:47.144 --> 00:17:49.739
People wanna know that
their government has a response.

187
00:17:49.914 --> 00:17:52.406
I am that response.

188
00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:54.711
So, were there any witnesses?

189
00:17:54.885 --> 00:17:57.286
Well, sir, if you'll just follow me.

190
00:17:57.722 --> 00:18:00.624
We did find this.

191
00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.756
United States Government, huh?

192
00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:07.591
Guess that means something big's
happening here, eh?

193
00:18:07.765 --> 00:18:11.668
No, Marv. Big things happen in big places.

194
00:18:11.836 --> 00:18:15.830
And the sooner I fill out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.

195
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.432
Enormous beast, yeah...

196
00:18:20.978 --> 00:18:23.345
Biggest thing in this town is probably
the homecoming queen.

197
00:18:23.514 --> 00:18:25.449
Oh, my God!

198
00:18:30.454 --> 00:18:31.581
- Come on, Marv. Come on.
- Okay.

199
00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:33.088
I need a witness.
It's around the corner. Come on.

200
00:18:33.257 --> 00:18:34.418
- Pick up the pace here.
- Don't pull so hard.

201
00:18:34.592 --> 00:18:36.493
I've never seen anything like it.
It's like a big, big "chomp"

202
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:37.822
- out of the side of the car.
- Take it easy...

203
00:18:37.995 --> 00:18:40.191
It's like a bite out of a ham
sandwich, like a, uh...

204
00:18:44.468 --> 00:18:47.870
What uh, what are we looking
at here, Mr. Manley?

205
00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:50.437
Something big, Marv.

206
00:18:52.677 --> 00:18:54.669
Something big.

207
00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:03.520
Hello!

208
00:19:03.688 --> 00:19:06.317
Come out!

209
00:19:06.824 --> 00:19:08.452
Hey, big metal guy!

210
00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:11.562
I got food here for you!

211
00:19:12.163 --> 00:19:13.461
Metal!

212
00:19:13.631 --> 00:19:15.964
Crunchy, delicious metal!

213
00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:18.568
Come and get it!

214
00:20:55.966 --> 00:20:59.334
So, I guess you're not gonna hurt me, huh?

215
00:21:06.744 --> 00:21:08.440
The shutoff switch.

216
00:21:10.614 --> 00:21:12.583
You saw me save you.

217
00:21:14.952 --> 00:21:18.411
So, where are you from?

218
00:21:20.925 --> 00:21:23.485
You came from the sky, right?

219
00:21:23.994 --> 00:21:25.485
From up there?

220
00:21:25.963 --> 00:21:27.659
Don't you remember anything?

221
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.370
Hmm. Maybe it's that
bump on your head.

222
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.700
Do you talk?

223
00:21:39.977 --> 00:21:42.947
You know, words?
"Blah, blah, blah," like that?

224
00:21:43.113 --> 00:21:44.638
Can you do that? "Blah, blah, blah?"

225
00:21:48.652 --> 00:21:51.713
Well, you get the idea anyway.

226
00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:54.324
Let's see.

227
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:57.950
See this? This is called a rock.

228
00:21:58.128 --> 00:21:59.289
Rock.

229
00:21:59.563 --> 00:22:01.156
Rock.

230
00:22:01.332 --> 00:22:02.527
Good.

231
00:22:06.237 --> 00:22:07.364
Rock.

232
00:22:07.738 --> 00:22:09.297
Yes!

233
00:22:11.876 --> 00:22:13.708
- Rock.
- No, no.

234
00:22:14.078 --> 00:22:16.172
That is a tree.

235
00:22:16.847 --> 00:22:18.907
Rock. Tree.

236
00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:20.312
Get it?

237
00:22:21.252 --> 00:22:24.086
Rock. Tree.

238
00:22:24.255 --> 00:22:25.723
That's right!

239
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.355
Wow! My own giant robot.

240
00:22:28.525 --> 00:22:31.984
I am now the luckiest kid in America!

241
00:22:32.162 --> 00:22:33.255
This is unbelievable.

242
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.194
This is the greatest discovery since...

243
00:22:35.366 --> 00:22:37.995
I don't know, television or something!

244
00:22:38.168 --> 00:22:40.364
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some...

245
00:22:40.537 --> 00:22:42.028
No, they'll panic.

246
00:22:42.206 --> 00:22:45.074
People always wig out and start shooting
when they see something big like you.

247
00:22:45.242 --> 00:22:48.872
- Hmm?
- Oh, wig out. It means crazy.

248
00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:50.207
You know, like, uh...

249
00:22:53.717 --> 00:22:55.583
No, no, no! Don't do that!

250
00:22:55.853 --> 00:22:58.220
That's the kind of stuff
that makes them shoot at you.

251
00:22:58.422 --> 00:23:01.790
Two nights ago,
at approximately 1900 hours, sat com radar

252
00:23:01.959 --> 00:23:05.896
detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere.

253
00:23:06.063 --> 00:23:09.227
Losing contact with it two-and-a-half
miles off the coast of Rockwell.

254
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.302
Some assumed it was a large meteor
or a downed satellite.

255
00:23:12.469 --> 00:23:15.200
But my office in Washington received
a call from someone

256
00:23:15.372 --> 00:23:18.536
who reported an actual encounter
with the object.

257
00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:21.736
This is no meteor, gentlemen.

258
00:23:21.912 --> 00:23:25.371
This is something much more serious. So...

259
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:27.074
So, we can't call
Ripley's Believe It or Not

260
00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:29.652
because they wouldn't believe it.

261
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.448
And...

262
00:23:31.622 --> 00:23:34.490
Oh, it's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon

263
00:23:34.658 --> 00:23:36.422
Mom's gonna wonder where I am.

264
00:23:36.593 --> 00:23:40.997
If she comes looking for me and sees you
then we got the screaming problem again.

265
00:23:41.165 --> 00:23:44.795
So, for now, would you, you know, just...

266
00:23:44.969 --> 00:23:47.131
Just stay here, okay?

267
00:23:47.438 --> 00:23:48.770
I'll come back tomorrow.

268
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:55.636
Wow.

269
00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.446
Well, goodbye.

270
00:24:02.086 --> 00:24:03.281
No, no.

271
00:24:03.821 --> 00:24:05.016
Me go.

272
00:24:05.189 --> 00:24:06.623
You stay.

273
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.622
No following.

274
00:24:09.526 --> 00:24:11.256
Good.

275
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.489
I told you!

276
00:24:14.665 --> 00:24:18.261
I'll come back tomorrow!

277
00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:20.802
Now, stay!

278
00:24:24.708 --> 00:24:26.677
No, no, no!

279
00:24:26.844 --> 00:24:28.642
Bad robot!

280
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.824
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.

281
00:24:46.997 --> 00:24:48.989
My mom will wig out.

282
00:24:49.166 --> 00:24:51.465
That's right.

283
00:24:51.635 --> 00:24:57.006
So you have got to stay in the forest,
and I'll bring you some food tomorrow.

284
00:24:57.174 --> 00:25:00.975
But I gotta go home now.

285
00:25:01.812 --> 00:25:03.713
So, goodbye.

286
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.015
Hmm...

287
00:25:11.188 --> 00:25:12.349
Hey.

288
00:25:14.358 --> 00:25:15.724
Hey, wait a minute!

289
00:25:15.893 --> 00:25:17.555
What do you think you're doing?

290
00:25:17.728 --> 00:25:19.492
Look at this mess!

291
00:25:25.402 --> 00:25:26.597
Oh, no.

292
00:25:27.871 --> 00:25:29.032
Put it back!

293
00:25:29.206 --> 00:25:30.765
Put it back right now!

294
00:25:32.042 --> 00:25:35.240
Help me! I need your help!

295
00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:38.947
Good, good!

296
00:25:44.721 --> 00:25:46.553
Okay, put them together. See, like this.

297
00:25:46.723 --> 00:25:48.248
This one here, that one there.

298
00:25:49.626 --> 00:25:51.720
Okay, over, over. Good, good.

299
00:25:51.895 --> 00:25:53.693
Now the other one.

300
00:25:53.864 --> 00:25:55.924
Okay. Good enough. Let's go!

301
00:25:58.735 --> 00:26:00.795
What the...

302
00:26:01.572 --> 00:26:04.804
That's fine! Leave it alone!
The train is coming!

303
00:26:04.975 --> 00:26:06.739
The train is coming!

304
00:26:07.711 --> 00:26:09.077
Come on, let's go!

305
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.589
Oh, no, no, no, no.

306
00:26:32.603 --> 00:26:34.094
You're alive!

307
00:26:44.948 --> 00:26:47.975
Hello? Anybody out there?

308
00:26:48.152 --> 00:26:49.745
Oh, we're in trouble now.

309
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.979
Are you all right?

310
00:26:51.155 --> 00:26:52.817
Look, I've changed my mind.
You can follow me home.

311
00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.253
Okay. Let's go.

312
00:26:55.692 --> 00:26:57.126
Mayor's office.

313
00:26:57.294 --> 00:26:59.525
What? A train accident?

314
00:26:59.696 --> 00:27:01.460
What do you mean,
he hit a giant creature?

315
00:27:01.798 --> 00:27:03.460
What creature could be big enough to...

316
00:27:05.135 --> 00:27:06.194
I need your car.

317
00:27:46.977 --> 00:27:48.172
Hmm...

318
00:27:48.512 --> 00:27:50.879
Wow! You can fix yourself?

319
00:27:51.381 --> 00:27:52.974
Neato.

320
00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.750
Uh-oh, Mom's home. Just stay here, okay?

321
00:27:54.885 --> 00:27:56.353
I'll be back. Bye!

322
00:27:57.854 --> 00:28:00.551
Bye. Hmm?

323
00:28:08.532 --> 00:28:10.262
What happened here?

324
00:28:11.034 --> 00:28:13.902
Go on. Tell him what you saw, Frank.

325
00:28:15.706 --> 00:28:22.613
You're not gonna believe this,
but it was a giant metal man.

326
00:28:27.117 --> 00:28:30.576
Does anyone know where I can get
to a telephone nearby?

327
00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:35.579
Would you say grace, please?

328
00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:42.865
Oh, my God!

329
00:28:44.236 --> 00:28:47.365
Um... Oh, my God,

330
00:28:47.772 --> 00:28:49.866
we, uh, thank you.

331
00:28:50.408 --> 00:28:52.536
For the

332
00:28:52.744 --> 00:28:54.940
food that Mom

333
00:28:55.113 --> 00:28:57.207
has put in front of us and... Stop!

334
00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.616
The, the devil

335
00:29:00.885 --> 00:29:04.686
from doing bad things and, uh...

336
00:29:04.856 --> 00:29:07.052
Get out of here! Ah...

337
00:29:07.993 --> 00:29:09.086
Satan?

338
00:29:10.362 --> 00:29:13.059
Go! Go, so...

339
00:29:13.832 --> 00:29:16.063
That we may live in peace. Amen.

340
00:29:16.534 --> 00:29:17.593
Amen.

341
00:29:18.236 --> 00:29:21.729
That was, hmm, really unusual, Hogarth.

342
00:29:23.008 --> 00:29:25.375
- Forgot to wash my hands.
- Well, uh, okay.

343
00:29:29.214 --> 00:29:30.807
Tomorrowland...

344
00:29:31.082 --> 00:29:33.381
Promise of things to come.

345
00:29:38.256 --> 00:29:40.054
Stop, stop, stop!

346
00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:42.890
All right. Come on.
Come on. Over here.

347
00:29:45.497 --> 00:29:47.932
Oh.

348
00:29:57.375 --> 00:29:59.037
Oh...

349
00:30:00.612 --> 00:30:02.274
Come on. Come on, over here. Come on.

350
00:30:04.816 --> 00:30:06.808
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.

351
00:30:06.985 --> 00:30:08.613
I work for the government.

352
00:30:08.953 --> 00:30:10.785
Hogarth?

353
00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:14.786
Hogarth?

354
00:30:15.093 --> 00:30:17.460
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.

355
00:30:17.629 --> 00:30:19.309
Work for the government.
Your parents home?

356
00:30:19.431 --> 00:30:21.332
- We're eating.
- Mmm, boy.

357
00:30:21.499 --> 00:30:23.263
Who's there, honey?

358
00:30:23.601 --> 00:30:24.830
Oh, hello there.

359
00:30:25.003 --> 00:30:26.763
- Do you have a telephone I could use?
- Yes.

360
00:30:26.805 --> 00:30:28.740
- There's one in the kitchen.
- Well, thank you.

361
00:30:28.907 --> 00:30:30.637
Thank you very much.

362
00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:33.442
Here. Pretend you're a gangster.

363
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.108
Damn it, Mansley.
You call me at home for this?

364
00:30:37.282 --> 00:30:40.411
- You don't understand, sir.
- It ate my car.

365
00:30:40.585 --> 00:30:41.951
And you saw this happen?

366
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.080
No, I didn't actually see it.
It went off into the woods.

367
00:30:46.257 --> 00:30:48.089
So, you don't have any evidence?

368
00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:49.989
But, but, sir I've got an eyewitness!

369
00:30:50.161 --> 00:30:51.823
An eyewitness with a concussion.

370
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.661
This thing... This thing is a menace.

371
00:30:54.833 --> 00:30:56.825
It tore up
the power station. It...

372
00:30:57.001 --> 00:30:58.367
It caused a train wreck!

373
00:30:58.536 --> 00:31:01.802
What did?
Tell me again, Mansley, and this time

374
00:31:01.973 --> 00:31:03.339
listen to yourself.

375
00:31:05.009 --> 00:31:06.807
A giant metal monster.

376
00:31:09.481 --> 00:31:12.212
Please, sir. I've got a feeling
about this one.

377
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:15.814
That's lovely, Kent.
But let me try to explain how this works.

378
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.821
If you told me you'd found, say,
a giant footprint,

379
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:22.517
I might send over an expert
to make a plaster cast of it.

380
00:31:22.694 --> 00:31:24.185
Hell! You get me
a photograph of this thing

381
00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:26.388
and I could probably
get some troops over there!

382
00:31:26.564 --> 00:31:29.033
But you tell me you've got a "feeling"?

383
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.294
All right then, fine. You want evidence?

384
00:31:31.469 --> 00:31:36.203
I'll get you evidence. And when I do,
I'm gonna wanna a memo distributed.

385
00:31:36.374 --> 00:31:37.467
That sounds swell, Kent.

386
00:31:37.642 --> 00:31:40.510
I'm gonna want that memo
carbon copied and redistributed...

387
00:31:55.393 --> 00:31:57.988
Hi. Thanks for the use of your phone.

388
00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.390
Well, thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs...

389
00:32:01.566 --> 00:32:04.730
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.

390
00:32:04.903 --> 00:32:06.895
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

391
00:32:07.238 --> 00:32:09.173
That's Hogarth!

392
00:32:10.175 --> 00:32:11.438
Hogarth.

393
00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:13.100
What an embarrassing name.

394
00:32:13.278 --> 00:32:15.247
Might as well call him Zeppo or something.

395
00:32:15.413 --> 00:32:18.110
What kind of a sick person
would name a kid Hogar...

396
00:32:20.185 --> 00:32:21.380
Hog Hug...

397
00:32:21.553 --> 00:32:23.249
Hog Hug. Hogarth Hughes!

398
00:32:27.792 --> 00:32:30.284
Kent Mansley.
You work for the government.

399
00:32:30.628 --> 00:32:32.597
I wasn't gonna say that.

400
00:32:32.931 --> 00:32:35.093
I have something for you, Hogarth.

401
00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:37.599
Your BB gun. Where did you find that?

402
00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:39.101
Up at the power station.

403
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.967
- Hogarth was out there the other night.
- Really?

404
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.405
See anything unusual, Hogarth?

405
00:32:44.809 --> 00:32:49.975
No... thing... unusual, really.

406
00:32:55.053 --> 00:32:56.214
Gotta use the bathroom.

407
00:33:04.395 --> 00:33:06.091
Strange, he's so tightlipped now.

408
00:33:06.264 --> 00:33:08.024
And the other night
he couldn't stop talking.

409
00:33:08.132 --> 00:33:10.294
I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot.

410
00:33:10.468 --> 00:33:12.130
A hundred-foot robot?

411
00:33:12.303 --> 00:33:14.169
That's nutty!

412
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.472
- What else did he say?
- No, wait, stop!

413
00:33:19.344 --> 00:33:20.676
Excuse me.

414
00:33:25.083 --> 00:33:26.142
Hogarth?

415
00:33:26.317 --> 00:33:27.808
What is going on in there?

416
00:33:30.922 --> 00:33:32.481
Are you all right?

417
00:33:32.657 --> 00:33:34.125
I'm fine.

418
00:33:34.292 --> 00:33:36.659
You know, this sort of thing
is why it's so important

419
00:33:36.828 --> 00:33:39.320
to really chew your food.

420
00:33:43.835 --> 00:33:45.997
Hogarth?

421
00:33:46.538 --> 00:33:47.767
Hogarth?

422
00:33:47.939 --> 00:33:50.602
- Mom! A little privacy?
- Sorry.

423
00:33:50.775 --> 00:33:52.334
- Ow. Ha-ha. Ow.
- Sorry.

424
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.502
Oh, Lord, he's been acting strange lately.

425
00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:55.772
That hurt.

426
00:34:06.691 --> 00:34:08.717
Thank you again, Annie.

427
00:34:10.695 --> 00:34:12.994
Good night, Hogarth.
I'm sure we'll see each other again

428
00:34:13.898 --> 00:34:15.696
real soon.

429
00:34:22.407 --> 00:34:27.072
If you're gonna stay here
you gotta keep better track of yourself.

430
00:34:27.245 --> 00:34:28.543
Sheesh.

431
00:34:28.813 --> 00:34:33.308
Anyway, I thought you'd like, you know,
a bedtime story or something.

432
00:34:33.518 --> 00:34:36.215
I've got some really cool ones.

433
00:34:36.888 --> 00:34:38.151
MAD Magazine,

434
00:34:38.323 --> 00:34:40.053
very funny.

435
00:34:40.825 --> 00:34:42.885
The Spirit, very cool.

436
00:34:43.561 --> 00:34:44.995
Boy's Life... Ehh...

437
00:34:45.163 --> 00:34:46.392
Oh, here.

438
00:34:46.731 --> 00:34:49.257
This guy is Superman.

439
00:34:49.734 --> 00:34:51.498
Sure, he's famous now,

440
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:53.695
- but he started off just like you.
- Hmm...

441
00:34:53.905 --> 00:34:57.239
Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.

442
00:34:57.408 --> 00:35:02.244
But he only uses his powers for good,
never for evil.

443
00:35:02.914 --> 00:35:04.405
Remember that.

444
00:35:10.088 --> 00:35:12.751
Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace.

445
00:35:13.057 --> 00:35:15.583
He's not the hero. He's the villain.

446
00:35:15.893 --> 00:35:17.555
He's not like you.

447
00:35:17.762 --> 00:35:19.390
You're a good guy.

448
00:35:19.897 --> 00:35:21.388
Like Superman.

449
00:35:21.799 --> 00:35:23.427
Superman.

450
00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:30.436
- Oh, you're hungry, aren't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

451
00:35:30.608 --> 00:35:32.941
But I don't have any metal here.

452
00:35:33.578 --> 00:35:35.103
Just follow me.

453
00:35:37.081 --> 00:35:38.606
Pick me up, okay?

454
00:35:47.625 --> 00:35:49.093
Wow.

455
00:35:50.628 --> 00:35:52.256
Okay, now, march!

456
00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:58.633
Whoo.

457
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.309
Hmm?

458
00:36:13.484 --> 00:36:15.248
Oh, yeah. That's Rockwell.

459
00:36:15.586 --> 00:36:18.146
- Nice place, huh?
- Rockwell?

460
00:36:18.356 --> 00:36:20.848
Yes, I was born right down there.

461
00:36:21.025 --> 00:36:22.425
Rockwell!

462
00:36:24.629 --> 00:36:26.359
No, stop! Look out for the cow!

463
00:36:27.165 --> 00:36:28.997
Come on, no, not there!

464
00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:32.001
Please stop. No, stop!

465
00:36:34.439 --> 00:36:36.374
We can't go there yet.

466
00:36:36.607 --> 00:36:39.167
People just aren't ready for you.

467
00:36:51.689 --> 00:36:53.214
That was close.

468
00:36:53.391 --> 00:36:55.690
We can't go running
around like that, okay?

469
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.295
- Hmm...
- Hey, look!

470
00:36:58.463 --> 00:36:59.829
Hmm?

471
00:37:01.299 --> 00:37:04.861
I guess that would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.

472
00:37:06.504 --> 00:37:08.473
Oh, no. We gotta hide!

473
00:37:08.873 --> 00:37:10.205
You know, hide?

474
00:37:10.374 --> 00:37:12.343
It's when you... You know, when you...

475
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.376
Just get behind something, quick!

476
00:37:18.816 --> 00:37:20.045
Don't move.

477
00:37:47.912 --> 00:37:50.609
Our troubles are over.

478
00:37:55.419 --> 00:37:56.546
This is it.

479
00:37:56.721 --> 00:37:58.349
All you can eat.

480
00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:14.395
Shh. Turn it off!

481
00:38:19.811 --> 00:38:21.609
Come on, turn it off!

482
00:38:30.221 --> 00:38:31.814
Oh, no.

483
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.670
All right, who's out there?

484
00:38:37.161 --> 00:38:40.654
Hey, hey, I know you. Squirrel boy.

485
00:38:40.832 --> 00:38:41.959
Hogarth.

486
00:38:42.133 --> 00:38:44.762
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.

487
00:38:44.936 --> 00:38:46.962
Well, come on inside, kid.

488
00:38:47.138 --> 00:38:48.504
Sorry about the crowbar.

489
00:38:49.173 --> 00:38:52.234
You'd be surprised how many
people wanna steal scrap.

490
00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:56.142
But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.

491
00:38:56.314 --> 00:38:57.577
I mean, what am I?

492
00:38:57.748 --> 00:39:01.310
A junkman who sells art
or an artist who sells junk?

493
00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:02.919
You tell me.

494
00:39:03.087 --> 00:39:05.147
I like it... I think.

495
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:10.189
Listen, you're, you're not
gonna call my mom, are you?

496
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:12.193
She doesn't know I'm out. I...

497
00:39:12.363 --> 00:39:15.959
Don't worry, kid. Look, it's not my style
to report a guy to the authorities.

498
00:39:17.435 --> 00:39:19.666
I'm gonna have some coffee.
What do you want, some, uh,

499
00:39:19.837 --> 00:39:22.432
milk, or what? Milk?

500
00:39:22.607 --> 00:39:23.836
Coffee's fine.

501
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.177
Yeah. I drink it. I'm hip.

502
00:39:28.346 --> 00:39:29.507
I don't know.

503
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.173
This is espresso, you know?
It's like coffee-zilla.

504
00:39:33.351 --> 00:39:35.445
I said, I'm hip.

505
00:39:38.556 --> 00:39:40.149
So she moved me up a grade
because I wasn't fitting in.

506
00:39:40.324 --> 00:39:41.656
So, now I'm even more not fitting in.

507
00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:43.158
I was getting good grades.
You know, like all A's.

508
00:39:43.327 --> 00:39:44.625
So, my mom says, "You need stimulation."

509
00:39:44.795 --> 00:39:46.354
And I go, "No, I'm
stimulated enough right now."

510
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.690
- That's for sure.
- She goes,

511
00:39:47.832 --> 00:39:48.959
"Uh-uh, you don't have a challenge.

512
00:39:49.133 --> 00:39:50.897
"You need a challenge."
So, now I'm challenged, all right.

513
00:39:51.068 --> 00:39:53.003
I'm challenged to hold on
to my lunch money,

514
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.798
because of all the big mooses
who wanna pound me

515
00:39:54.972 --> 00:39:56.873
because I'm a shrimpy dork
who thinks he's smarter than them.

516
00:39:57.041 --> 00:39:59.306
But I don't think I am smarter,
I just do the stupid homework.

517
00:39:59.477 --> 00:40:00.843
If everyone else just did
the stupid homework

518
00:40:01.012 --> 00:40:02.139
they could move up a grade
and get pounded too.

519
00:40:02.313 --> 00:40:03.645
Is there anymore coffee?

520
00:40:03.814 --> 00:40:05.874
Look, it's really
none of my business, kid,

521
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:09.714
but, um, who cares
what these creeps think, you know?

522
00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:12.721
They don't decide who you are. You do.

523
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:16.054
You are who you choose to be.

524
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.357
Did you hear that?

525
00:40:20.531 --> 00:40:21.999
No, wait. Stop!

526
00:40:34.412 --> 00:40:35.903
- It's okay!
- My God!

527
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.276
- He isn't gonna...
- Run, kid! Run!

528
00:40:42.086 --> 00:40:44.214
It's okay. He isn't...

529
00:40:44.388 --> 00:40:46.220
It's okay. He isn't gonna hurt me.

530
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:47.517
Oh, hey...

531
00:40:47.692 --> 00:40:49.388
Don't squash him! No! Don't...

532
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.085
Do not...

533
00:40:51.262 --> 00:40:53.424
Squash him.

534
00:40:54.432 --> 00:40:55.593
His name is Dean.

535
00:40:55.766 --> 00:40:57.735
We like Dean.

536
00:40:58.569 --> 00:40:59.901
Dean.

537
00:41:01.706 --> 00:41:03.106
So...

538
00:41:03.274 --> 00:41:05.470
Where'd, uh, where'd he come from?

539
00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:07.434
He doesn't remember.

540
00:41:07.611 --> 00:41:09.910
He's like a little kid.

541
00:41:10.081 --> 00:41:12.448
Little. Yeah.

542
00:41:12.616 --> 00:41:15.108
Wait a minute. You can talk to him?

543
00:41:15.286 --> 00:41:19.246
Kinda. He can't say a lot of words yet
but he understands things pretty good.

544
00:41:19.423 --> 00:41:20.618
Oh, yeah. I see.

545
00:41:25.329 --> 00:41:27.958
He needs food and shelter.

546
00:41:40.811 --> 00:41:44.009
You got plenty of room here.
This place is perfect.

547
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:45.410
Go away.

548
00:41:45.583 --> 00:41:48.985
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.

549
00:41:49.153 --> 00:41:51.486
Hogarth. I can't hide it here.

550
00:41:51.655 --> 00:41:53.681
- "Him," not "it."
- Whatever.

551
00:41:53.858 --> 00:41:56.089
You don't even know where "he" came from

552
00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.456
or, or what the hell "he" is!

553
00:41:58.629 --> 00:42:00.325
He's my friend.

554
00:42:01.298 --> 00:42:03.995
Yeah, what am I? Am I your friend?

555
00:42:04.168 --> 00:42:06.330
Bring some Franken-bot with
out-of-state plates,

556
00:42:06.504 --> 00:42:08.336
make me change my tune.

557
00:42:08.506 --> 00:42:11.340
I don't like that jazz. God, I'm tired.

558
00:42:11.509 --> 00:42:13.341
So, he can stay?

559
00:42:13.511 --> 00:42:17.471
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.

560
00:42:26.524 --> 00:42:28.220
Sleep tight.

561
00:42:28.392 --> 00:42:30.361
I'll see you tomorrow.

562
00:42:44.575 --> 00:42:46.737
- You're up already?
- Just making the bed.

563
00:42:46.911 --> 00:42:50.643
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

564
00:42:55.219 --> 00:42:57.814
Morning, sport. Sleep well?

565
00:42:57.988 --> 00:42:59.581
Mom?

566
00:43:00.224 --> 00:43:03.558
Isn't it wonderful, Hogarth?
We finally rented our room.

567
00:43:03.727 --> 00:43:06.492
Ugh. I'm not very hungry.

568
00:43:13.737 --> 00:43:16.263
Oh, yeah.

569
00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:20.336
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling please?

570
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:22.912
I said he could stay the night, kid.

571
00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.173
It's morning now.

572
00:43:24.348 --> 00:43:26.340
Look, I'll try
to come over, okay?

573
00:43:26.517 --> 00:43:28.748
But there's this weird guy here
who's watching me.

574
00:43:28.919 --> 00:43:30.079
What's that supposed to mean?

575
00:43:30.221 --> 00:43:33.749
I got this big, giant...
Giant thing out here.

576
00:43:33.924 --> 00:43:36.792
- I can't talk right now, okay? Bye.
- Hogarth!

577
00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:38.862
Who was that, sport? Friend of yours?

578
00:43:39.029 --> 00:43:41.191
Yeah. He's, uh, a new kid.

579
00:43:41.532 --> 00:43:46.095
What... I...
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop that! Stop it!

580
00:43:47.538 --> 00:43:50.235
Hey, mind if I ask you a few
questions there, buckaroo?

581
00:43:50.407 --> 00:43:53.434
Now, why would you tell your mom
about a giant robot, slugger?

582
00:43:53.611 --> 00:43:55.273
Say, what'd you see at the power station?
Huh, tiger?

583
00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:57.779
You tell anyone else about this, buddy?
How big is this thing, ranger?

584
00:43:57.948 --> 00:43:59.246
Been in the forest lately?
Hey. Where you going?

585
00:43:59.416 --> 00:44:01.176
Champ? Slugger? Hey, cowboy?
Where you goin'?

586
00:44:01.252 --> 00:44:03.619
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going out!

587
00:44:03.787 --> 00:44:06.757
Why don't you take Mr. Mansley with you?
Show him the sights.

588
00:44:06.924 --> 00:44:08.825
Oh, Mom, the sights?

589
00:44:08.993 --> 00:44:10.962
Hey, I'd love that. Give us a chance
to get acquainted,

590
00:44:11.128 --> 00:44:12.596
swap some stories, huh, chief?

591
00:44:12.763 --> 00:44:14.891
There are two kinds of metal in this yard.

592
00:44:15.065 --> 00:44:16.658
Scrap and art.

593
00:44:16.834 --> 00:44:19.133
If you gotta eat one of them,
eat the scrap.

594
00:44:19.303 --> 00:44:23.764
What you currently have
in your mouth is art!

595
00:44:27.444 --> 00:44:28.503
Art?

596
00:44:34.618 --> 00:44:36.519
Oh, forget it. Forget it!

597
00:44:36.687 --> 00:44:39.782
It's gone. It's...

598
00:44:39.957 --> 00:44:42.791
Hmm. That's not bad.

599
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:48.964
First, you take
a chocolate bar. Any bar'll do.

600
00:44:49.133 --> 00:44:50.692
- Oh.
- Do you mind if I, uh...

601
00:44:50.868 --> 00:44:52.359
No, knock yourself out, skipper.

602
00:44:53.137 --> 00:44:56.130
You crumble up the chocolate
into little pieces.

603
00:44:56.307 --> 00:44:59.675
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?

604
00:44:59.843 --> 00:45:01.971
Yes, I see. What do you call this again?

605
00:45:02.146 --> 00:45:04.775
Landslide. It's new. Very new.

606
00:45:04.949 --> 00:45:10.354
Mmm. Landslide. Topnotch. Mmm.

607
00:45:10.521 --> 00:45:15.186
You know, Hogarth, we live
in a strange and wondrous time.

608
00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:17.021
The Atomic Age.

609
00:45:17.194 --> 00:45:20.164
But there's a dark side
to progress, Hogarth.

610
00:45:20.331 --> 00:45:21.856
Ever hear of Sputnik?

611
00:45:22.032 --> 00:45:24.467
Yeah, it's the first satellite in space.

612
00:45:24.702 --> 00:45:28.400
Foreign satellite, Hogarth,
and all that that implies.

613
00:45:28.572 --> 00:45:31.201
Even now, it orbits overhead.

614
00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:33.003
Boop. Boop.

615
00:45:33.177 --> 00:45:35.078
Watching us.

616
00:45:35.246 --> 00:45:37.238
We can't see it, but it's there.

617
00:45:37.414 --> 00:45:39.906
Much like that giant thing in the woods.

618
00:45:40.217 --> 00:45:42.049
We don't know what it is
or what it can do.

619
00:45:42.219 --> 00:45:43.983
I don't feel safe, Hogarth.

620
00:45:44.154 --> 00:45:46.385
- Do you?
- What are you talking about?

621
00:45:46.557 --> 00:45:50.187
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?

622
00:45:50.561 --> 00:45:53.087
I'm talking about
your goldarned security, Hogarth!

623
00:45:53.264 --> 00:45:55.062
While you're snoozing
in your little jammies,

624
00:45:55.232 --> 00:45:57.701
back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?

625
00:45:57.868 --> 00:46:00.736
Because everyone wants
what we have, Hogarth! Everyone!

626
00:46:00.904 --> 00:46:02.873
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?

627
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.602
The Russians? The Chinese? Martians?
Canadians? I don't care!

628
00:46:06.777 --> 00:46:09.110
All I know is, we didn't build it,
and that's reason enough

629
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.909
to assume the worst
and blow it to kingdom come!

630
00:46:12.082 --> 00:46:15.416
Now, you'll tell me about this thing.
You're gonna lead me to it.

631
00:46:15.586 --> 00:46:18.055
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!

632
00:46:20.724 --> 00:46:22.192
Just hold that thought
and stay right there.

633
00:46:22.359 --> 00:46:23.850
Oh-oh.

634
00:46:29.833 --> 00:46:31.699
Little lower. Little bit lower...

635
00:46:31.869 --> 00:46:34.464
Hey. I thought you were in trouble.

636
00:46:34.638 --> 00:46:36.158
That sucks.
Let me just... Up a little.

637
00:46:36.206 --> 00:46:38.903
I had to ditch this weird guy
who's staying at our house.

638
00:46:39.076 --> 00:46:41.136
It took me hours to shake him!

639
00:46:41.312 --> 00:46:43.247
I kill myself to get out here!

640
00:46:43.414 --> 00:46:46.942
And you have him doing... Arts and crafts!

641
00:46:47.117 --> 00:46:49.916
You got a problem with
arts and crafts, little man?

642
00:46:50.087 --> 00:46:54.047
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a little undignified.

643
00:46:54.224 --> 00:46:57.661
Yeah? Well, smart guy,
what would you have him do?

644
00:47:01.065 --> 00:47:04.661
Main systems on. Main engines.

645
00:47:04.835 --> 00:47:06.463
One, two and three.

646
00:47:06.637 --> 00:47:12.338
All systems go.
Five, four, three two, one!

647
00:47:12.509 --> 00:47:13.772
Blast off!

648
00:47:24.855 --> 00:47:27.256
We're landing. We're landing!

649
00:47:27.424 --> 00:47:29.791
We're landing!

650
00:47:35.766 --> 00:47:38.167
Say, can you guys
cool yourselves a little?

651
00:47:38.335 --> 00:47:40.167
I feel like we're pressing our luck here.

652
00:47:40.337 --> 00:47:42.363
Hey, baby, we are cool!

653
00:47:42.539 --> 00:47:45.373
Welcome to downtown Coolsville.

654
00:47:45.542 --> 00:47:47.511
Population? Us.

655
00:47:47.678 --> 00:47:52.673
Well, can you move Coolsville
to someplace less conspicuous?

656
00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:55.820
- How about the lake?
- Okay.

657
00:47:55.986 --> 00:47:58.683
Aw, come with us. It'll be fun.

658
00:48:49.506 --> 00:48:53.409
This can't last forever, Hogarth.
We gotta tell somebody about him.

659
00:48:53.577 --> 00:48:55.443
Ah, you worry too much.

660
00:48:58.348 --> 00:49:01.284
Hey, Dean! Watch this!

661
00:49:01.452 --> 00:49:03.580
All right, we're watching. We're watching.

662
00:49:03.754 --> 00:49:06.952
This one's for professionals only!

663
00:49:08.792 --> 00:49:10.260
Banzai!

664
00:49:15.799 --> 00:49:19.065
Come on in!

665
00:49:19.236 --> 00:49:21.899
The water's great!

666
00:49:22.072 --> 00:49:23.938
No, thanks.

667
00:49:24.107 --> 00:49:26.099
You weenie!

668
00:49:27.778 --> 00:49:28.871
Come on in.

669
00:49:29.046 --> 00:49:31.982
It's really, really refreshing.

670
00:49:39.289 --> 00:49:41.884
What? You too?

671
00:49:42.059 --> 00:49:45.291
You big baby!

672
00:49:50.734 --> 00:49:52.635
Banzai!

673
00:50:24.768 --> 00:50:26.669
Whoo!

674
00:50:30.641 --> 00:50:32.166
- Hey.
- Yeah?

675
00:50:32.342 --> 00:50:35.278
- You're in the middle of the road!
- Yeah?

676
00:50:35.445 --> 00:50:36.538
All right.

677
00:50:40.183 --> 00:50:43.847
I think that's enough fun for one day.

678
00:50:58.368 --> 00:51:00.394
Are you okay in there,
Mr. Mansley?

679
00:51:00.571 --> 00:51:02.251
I'm back with the toilet paper you needed.

680
00:51:02.339 --> 00:51:06.037
Thanks!
I think I'm feeling better now.

681
00:51:06.209 --> 00:51:08.838
Much. Much better.

682
00:51:16.853 --> 00:51:18.913
It's beautiful, huh?

683
00:51:19.089 --> 00:51:20.717
Hey, look!

684
00:51:22.426 --> 00:51:24.224
It's a deer.

685
00:51:24.394 --> 00:51:25.657
- Deer?
- Shh.

686
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:27.422
Let's get closer.

687
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.692
Hmm. Well, I guess he decided to...

688
00:52:11.642 --> 00:52:13.702
It's the monster!

689
00:52:16.747 --> 00:52:18.113
Oh, no.

690
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:28.054
It's dead.

691
00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:31.655
Dead?

692
00:52:34.831 --> 00:52:36.265
Don't do that!

693
00:52:38.135 --> 00:52:39.296
Why?

694
00:52:39.469 --> 00:52:42.268
It's dead. Understand?

695
00:52:42.439 --> 00:52:45.841
They shot it with that gun.

696
00:52:54.918 --> 00:52:56.352
Hey, what's wrong?

697
00:52:58.321 --> 00:53:01.587
- Guns.
- Yes. Guns kill.

698
00:53:02.659 --> 00:53:05.322
Guns kill.

699
00:53:30.187 --> 00:53:34.648
I know you feel bad about the deer.
But it's not your fault.

700
00:53:34.825 --> 00:53:36.316
Things die.

701
00:53:36.493 --> 00:53:38.325
It's part of life.

702
00:53:38.495 --> 00:53:40.657
It's bad to kill.

703
00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:42.857
But it's not bad to die.

704
00:53:43.467 --> 00:53:45.026
You die?

705
00:53:45.068 --> 00:53:46.559
Well, yes, someday.

706
00:53:50.774 --> 00:53:53.005
I die?

707
00:53:53.176 --> 00:53:54.940
I don't know.

708
00:53:55.112 --> 00:53:59.516
You're made of metal
but you have feelings.

709
00:53:59.683 --> 00:54:01.709
And you think about things.

710
00:54:01.885 --> 00:54:04.320
And that means you have a soul.

711
00:54:05.155 --> 00:54:07.852
And souls don't die.

712
00:54:08.024 --> 00:54:09.890
Soul?

713
00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.928
Mom says it's something inside
of all good things,

714
00:54:14.297 --> 00:54:16.857
and that it goes on forever and ever.

715
00:54:31.581 --> 00:54:35.074
Souls don't die.

716
00:54:48.198 --> 00:54:50.099
You're very kind. Thank you so much.

717
00:54:52.035 --> 00:54:54.937
You ever seen a better picture than that?
Look at those details.

718
00:54:55.105 --> 00:54:58.769
This is the famous 60 second
Polaroid Land camera.

719
00:54:59.209 --> 00:55:00.529
Seeing the results on the spot...

720
00:55:08.351 --> 00:55:09.546
In 60 seconds...

721
00:55:11.288 --> 00:55:14.952
You know, if you...

722
00:55:15.926 --> 00:55:17.519
Don't you remember...

723
00:55:25.569 --> 00:55:27.765
You saw me save you.

724
00:55:29.072 --> 00:55:31.735
You came from the sky, right?

725
00:55:35.879 --> 00:55:38.144
You don't even know
where "he" came from.

726
00:55:38.315 --> 00:55:41.217
Or what the hell "he" is!

727
00:55:48.058 --> 00:55:49.993
Guess you're not gonna hurt me.

728
00:56:12.916 --> 00:56:14.475
You're late for dinner, Hogarth.

729
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.853
Your mom's working late tonight, Hogarth.

730
00:56:20.023 --> 00:56:21.457
So it's just us guys.

731
00:56:21.625 --> 00:56:24.356
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!

732
00:56:25.862 --> 00:56:29.492
How's that? A little too bright? Good.

733
00:56:31.468 --> 00:56:34.836
Forgive me, Hogarth.
I wanted you to learn something.

734
00:56:35.005 --> 00:56:36.701
What can I learn from you?

735
00:56:36.873 --> 00:56:38.102
You can learn this, Hogarth.

736
00:56:38.275 --> 00:56:40.369
That I can do anything I want,
whenever I want,

737
00:56:40.543 --> 00:56:42.842
if I feel it's in
the people's best interest.

738
00:56:43.013 --> 00:56:45.141
The giant metal man, where is it?

739
00:56:45.315 --> 00:56:47.875
I don't know what you're talking about.

740
00:56:48.051 --> 00:56:49.952
You don't? Well.

741
00:56:51.621 --> 00:56:53.487
Does this ring a bell?

742
00:56:54.324 --> 00:56:55.519
No?

743
00:56:55.692 --> 00:56:57.058
How about this?

744
00:56:58.361 --> 00:57:00.227
You've been careless, Hogarth.

745
00:57:00.397 --> 00:57:01.729
It doesn't prove anything.

746
00:57:01.898 --> 00:57:04.493
It's enough to get the Army here
with one phone call.

747
00:57:04.668 --> 00:57:07.638
- Then what's stopping you?
- Where's the giant?

748
00:57:07.804 --> 00:57:10.035
You can't protect him, Hogarth,

749
00:57:10.206 --> 00:57:13.574
any more than you can
protect your mother.

750
00:57:13.743 --> 00:57:14.904
My mom?

751
00:57:15.078 --> 00:57:17.547
Ah, it's difficult
to raise a boy all alone.

752
00:57:17.714 --> 00:57:19.148
We can make it more difficult.

753
00:57:19.316 --> 00:57:21.251
In fact, we can make it so difficult

754
00:57:21.418 --> 00:57:24.582
that it would be irresponsible
for us to leave you in her care

755
00:57:24.754 --> 00:57:26.723
and all that that implies.

756
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:29.587
- You'll be taken away from her, Hogarth.
- You can't do that!

757
00:57:29.759 --> 00:57:32.388
Oh, we can. And we will.

758
00:57:36.433 --> 00:57:38.527
He's in the junkyard.

759
00:57:38.702 --> 00:57:41.001
McCoppin's Scrap, off Culver Road.

760
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:45.609
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metal-eater.

761
00:57:45.942 --> 00:57:49.845
I wouldn't worry about this, Hogarth.
It isn't really happening.

762
00:57:50.013 --> 00:57:52.244
This is only a bad dream.

763
00:57:56.186 --> 00:57:59.623
Where's the giant?

764
00:57:59.789 --> 00:58:02.623
This is only a bad dream.

765
00:58:02.792 --> 00:58:04.124
Yes, sir.

766
00:58:04.294 --> 00:58:05.728
This thing is real, sir.

767
00:58:05.895 --> 00:58:08.763
I not only have incontrovertible
evidence, General,

768
00:58:08.932 --> 00:58:10.696
I know where it's hidden.

769
00:58:10.867 --> 00:58:12.199
I don't know who built it, but it's here.

770
00:58:12.369 --> 00:58:14.895
It's massive
and we're running out of time.

771
00:58:15.071 --> 00:58:17.870
There's no doubt we should act.
The only question, sir, is...

772
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:20.306
Can you afford not to?

773
00:58:20.477 --> 00:58:24.471
Excellent, sir. You won't regret it.
Thank you, sir.

774
00:58:35.158 --> 00:58:38.959
The Army arrives in the morning, Hogarth.
Don't get cute.

775
00:58:44.334 --> 00:58:45.825
I gotta warn Dean.

776
00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.249
I'll be watching you.

777
01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:18.523
Morning, Kent.

778
01:00:26.769 --> 01:00:31.264
For some reason, the Army
is in our front yard, Mr. Mansley.

779
01:00:31.441 --> 01:00:33.569
Please, call me Kent.

780
01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:43.416
Okay.

781
01:00:59.602 --> 01:01:01.798
- All right, where is it?
- What?

782
01:01:01.971 --> 01:01:03.940
You know darn well what. The monster.

783
01:01:04.107 --> 01:01:07.271
The giant thing. The metal man.

784
01:01:08.578 --> 01:01:13.448
Ah, the metal man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.

785
01:01:13.616 --> 01:01:16.643
I thought I was under attack or something.

786
01:01:16.819 --> 01:01:18.082
He's in the back.

787
01:01:18.254 --> 01:01:20.155
Come on. I'll show you.

788
01:01:25.728 --> 01:01:27.822
You guys got here just in time.

789
01:01:27.997 --> 01:01:30.796
This rich cat,
you know, some industrialist,

790
01:01:30.967 --> 01:01:33.266
wants him for the lobby of his company.

791
01:01:33.436 --> 01:01:35.405
He whipped out his checkbook on the spot.

792
01:01:35.572 --> 01:01:38.906
I said, "Hey, you got him
for the rest of your life.

793
01:01:39.075 --> 01:01:43.103
"But, what, I gotta let go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.

794
01:01:43.279 --> 01:01:45.510
"Give me some time
to cut the umbilical, man."

795
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:48.441
Here he is.

796
01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:56.123
Anyway, I haven't sold him yet.

797
01:01:56.292 --> 01:02:00.753
So if you really want him and if,
you know, you throw in

798
01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:03.024
a competitive bid...

799
01:02:03.199 --> 01:02:04.963
Sir, I... Listen... Sir, listen...

800
01:02:05.134 --> 01:02:07.433
- Step outside, Mansley.
- Yes.

801
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.704
You realize how much hardware
I brought out here?

802
01:02:10.873 --> 01:02:14.969
You just blew millions of Uncle Sam's
dollars out of your butt!

803
01:02:15.144 --> 01:02:17.875
I gotta admit, I'm relieved that

804
01:02:18.047 --> 01:02:20.380
this is what Hogarth was talking about.

805
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:23.850
I mean, I was beginning to, um,
think it was real.

806
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.718
Don't get me wrong, I like it.

807
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:30.724
But, uh, do you need all this stuff
on the surface?

808
01:02:30.893 --> 01:02:34.386
Well, um, no, actually.

809
01:02:34.564 --> 01:02:37.557
It just sort of...
It seems kind of slapped on.

810
01:02:37.734 --> 01:02:40.033
You know, not as thought-out
as this other piece.

811
01:02:40.203 --> 01:02:42.900
- You like that one?
- Yeah.

812
01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.532
You'll be chief inspector
of subway toilets

813
01:02:46.709 --> 01:02:48.405
by the time I'm finished with you!

814
01:02:48.578 --> 01:02:52.982
Now, pack up. I'll expect you back
in Washington to clear out your office.

815
01:02:53.149 --> 01:02:54.378
Yes, sir.

816
01:02:57.086 --> 01:02:59.555
Hmm. I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

817
01:02:59.722 --> 01:03:01.953
You mean, you know about that?

818
01:03:02.225 --> 01:03:04.057
Aw. Now I do.

819
01:03:18.241 --> 01:03:21.973
Bye, Kent, and all that implies.

820
01:03:22.145 --> 01:03:23.704
Okay, you can move now.

821
01:03:25.315 --> 01:03:26.681
Nice job!

822
01:03:31.988 --> 01:03:33.650
Thruster to base.

823
01:03:33.823 --> 01:03:35.485
I'm goin' in.

824
01:03:35.658 --> 01:03:38.651
Only one creature could create
so much destruction.

825
01:03:38.828 --> 01:03:40.592
The hideous, people-eating,

826
01:03:40.763 --> 01:03:44.097
killing machine, Atomo!

827
01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:47.502
Atomo?

828
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.662
No Atomo.

829
01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:00.016
I Superman.

830
01:04:00.183 --> 01:04:02.243
Okay, Superman.

831
01:04:02.418 --> 01:04:03.681
Take this!

832
01:04:07.724 --> 01:04:09.022
Stupid gun.

833
01:04:21.971 --> 01:04:23.633
Hey. What's wrong?

834
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:28.801
As I was saying, take this!

835
01:04:32.482 --> 01:04:33.882
Oh!

836
01:04:35.051 --> 01:04:36.291
What happened? What was that...

837
01:04:36.386 --> 01:04:38.787
Shh. Stay down and follow me.

838
01:04:42.992 --> 01:04:44.392
Shh.

839
01:04:45.395 --> 01:04:46.727
Get back!

840
01:04:49.565 --> 01:04:51.898
I said, get back! I mean it!

841
01:04:52.769 --> 01:04:54.761
No, stop. Why?

842
01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:57.065
It was an accident. He's our friend.

843
01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.007
He's a piece of hardware, Hogarth.
Why do you think the Army was here?

844
01:05:01.177 --> 01:05:04.636
He's a weapon! A big gun that walks!

845
01:05:06.749 --> 01:05:08.274
I, I...

846
01:05:08.451 --> 01:05:09.919
I not gun.

847
01:05:10.086 --> 01:05:11.918
Yeah, what's that, huh?

848
01:05:12.422 --> 01:05:15.085
You almost did that to Hogarth!

849
01:05:16.292 --> 01:05:17.590
No.

850
01:05:21.164 --> 01:05:22.632
- Come back!
- Hogarth.

851
01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:24.358
- Hey, stop!
- Giant!

852
01:05:24.534 --> 01:05:26.025
Come back!

853
01:05:30.339 --> 01:05:31.967
It was defensive.

854
01:05:32.141 --> 01:05:34.337
He reacted to the gun.

855
01:05:37.547 --> 01:05:39.778
You're not gonna
get there fast enough on foot.

856
01:05:59.635 --> 01:06:02.127
See, I told you it was a big hoax.

857
01:06:02.305 --> 01:06:03.898
- Dad said...
- Give me the binoculars.

858
01:06:04.073 --> 01:06:06.542
- What? What?
- Hey, there it is. I see it!

859
01:06:07.643 --> 01:06:09.544
It's big. It's walking away.

860
01:06:09.712 --> 01:06:11.874
- Hey. Gimme those.
- Over there. See it?

861
01:06:12.048 --> 01:06:13.516
The monster! Holy cow!

862
01:06:15.151 --> 01:06:16.346
Watch it!

863
01:06:16.519 --> 01:06:17.817
Help!

864
01:06:17.987 --> 01:06:19.853
Somebody help me!

865
01:06:20.523 --> 01:06:21.991
- I don't wanna fall!
- Help!

866
01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:25.387
I'm slipping!

867
01:06:25.561 --> 01:06:27.826
I can't hold on much longer!

868
01:06:36.839 --> 01:06:38.364
- Dad!
- Daddy!

869
01:06:40.877 --> 01:06:43.437
- He saved those boys!
- It's friendly!

870
01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.088
What...

871
01:07:02.865 --> 01:07:04.128
Oh!

872
01:07:05.902 --> 01:07:07.029
Stop! Look!

873
01:07:07.203 --> 01:07:09.695
Look behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!

874
01:07:09.872 --> 01:07:11.636
It's stomping the town! I was right!

875
01:07:11.807 --> 01:07:14.800
- Sweet mother of God.
- Look, damn you!

876
01:07:22.585 --> 01:07:25.749
I am not a gun.

877
01:07:33.796 --> 01:07:35.662
Hey, Mom.

878
01:07:49.278 --> 01:07:50.473
Let's get out of here!

879
01:07:50.646 --> 01:07:51.807
Run!

880
01:08:03.159 --> 01:08:05.685
Hey. Stop! There's a kid in his hands!

881
01:08:05.861 --> 01:08:07.295
Stop shooting!

882
01:08:08.264 --> 01:08:10.529
Kent! He only reacts defensively.

883
01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.932
If you don't shoot, he's harmless.
You gotta tell the General!

884
01:08:14.103 --> 01:08:16.197
This is all your fault, beatnik.
If you hadn't...

885
01:08:16.372 --> 01:08:17.533
Would you shut up and listen?

886
01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:21.041
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.

887
01:08:22.144 --> 01:08:23.271
I'll take care of it.

888
01:08:28.718 --> 01:08:33.179
He says the monster's killed a kid.
Sir, we must stop it at all costs.

889
01:08:33.356 --> 01:08:35.825
Go to code red. Repeat, code red!

890
01:08:37.226 --> 01:08:39.889
Mr. President, we have a situation, sir.

891
01:08:46.235 --> 01:08:48.534
Watch it, lady!

892
01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:03.044
Look out for the bus!

893
01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:18.834
You can fly?

894
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:22.568
You can fly!

895
01:09:28.544 --> 01:09:29.842
Hogarth!

896
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.444
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
like Superman!

897
01:09:52.802 --> 01:09:54.430
No, no!

898
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:03.443
I've lost visual. Repeat, lost visual!

899
01:10:08.417 --> 01:10:10.545
Man, that was close!

900
01:10:13.789 --> 01:10:15.087
No!

901
01:10:17.126 --> 01:10:19.152
Ha. Gotcha!

902
01:10:36.812 --> 01:10:38.747
Good call, Mansley.

903
01:10:38.914 --> 01:10:43.579
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.

904
01:10:50.359 --> 01:10:51.486
Huh?

905
01:11:06.475 --> 01:11:08.376
Halt! Set your perimeter!

906
01:11:09.678 --> 01:11:12.113
- It's still alive!
- Shoot at it!

907
01:11:35.404 --> 01:11:36.838
Retreat! Retreat!

908
01:11:38.707 --> 01:11:40.403
Let's get out of here!

909
01:11:50.252 --> 01:11:51.880
Hogarth!

910
01:11:53.322 --> 01:11:56.258
He's unconscious, but he's okay.
Let's get him in the car.

911
01:11:56.692 --> 01:11:59.423
Drive, baby, drive! Step on it! Floor it!

912
01:11:59.595 --> 01:12:03.191
It's gaining on us. Faster! Faster! Hurry!

913
01:12:13.108 --> 01:12:14.940
All battleships fire at the robot!

914
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:16.271
Now!

915
01:12:16.445 --> 01:12:18.073
Now, damn it, now!

916
01:12:26.355 --> 01:12:29.291
Nothing can stop this thing!
We've hit it with everything we've got!

917
01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:31.427
Not everything, General. The bomb.

918
01:12:33.128 --> 01:12:35.791
The Nautilus has first strike capability
and is not far offshore.

919
01:12:36.799 --> 01:12:38.097
You scare me, Mansley.

920
01:12:38.267 --> 01:12:41.032
You want us to bomb ourselves
in order to kill it?

921
01:12:41.203 --> 01:12:43.570
General, the giant seems to follow
whatever attacks it.

922
01:12:43.739 --> 01:12:46.436
We can lure it away from the town,
then destroy it.

923
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.840
Radio the Nautilus. Tell them to target
the robot and await my command.

924
01:12:53.616 --> 01:12:56.085
This is Nautilus.
What is the giant's current position?

925
01:12:56.252 --> 01:12:58.915
67.71972 degrees west,

926
01:12:59.088 --> 01:13:02.058
by 44.50177 degrees north.

927
01:13:02.224 --> 01:13:03.351
Locked and loaded.

928
01:13:03.559 --> 01:13:05.255
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

929
01:13:05.427 --> 01:13:07.747
- Stop the car.
- Hogarth! My God, honey, you're all right.

930
01:13:07.863 --> 01:13:09.422
Go back! We've gotta help him!

931
01:13:09.598 --> 01:13:11.863
Are you crazy, kid?
You're lucky to be alive!

932
01:13:12.034 --> 01:13:13.593
We're taking you to a hospital.

933
01:13:19.608 --> 01:13:21.648
Everyone! Out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.

934
01:13:21.744 --> 01:13:23.804
What are you talking about?
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.

935
01:13:23.979 --> 01:13:25.140
What boy?

936
01:13:25.814 --> 01:13:27.043
Hogarth!

937
01:13:30.886 --> 01:13:32.218
Hogarth, no!

938
01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:44.956
Hey! No! Stop!

939
01:13:56.245 --> 01:13:57.508
This is General Rogard.

940
01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.275
Ready the attack and prepare
to retreat to the fallback position.

941
01:14:00.449 --> 01:14:03.942
No! No! Stop! My son is out there!

942
01:14:06.522 --> 01:14:09.959
No, wait. It's me, Hogarth. Remember?

943
01:14:10.626 --> 01:14:14.586
It's bad to kill. Guns kill.

944
01:14:14.763 --> 01:14:17.096
And you don't have to be a gun.

945
01:14:17.533 --> 01:14:20.093
You are what you choose to be.

946
01:14:20.703 --> 01:14:22.672
You choose.

947
01:14:23.605 --> 01:14:24.937
Choose.

948
01:14:26.175 --> 01:14:28.337
Hogarth.

949
01:14:36.151 --> 01:14:37.642
It's okay. It's okay.

950
01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.114
We gotta show them you're good.

951
01:14:44.126 --> 01:14:46.118
Nautilus to Rogard,
missile armed and ready.

952
01:14:46.295 --> 01:14:47.888
What are you saying, he's friendly?

953
01:14:48.063 --> 01:14:50.623
Yes. Attacking him is triggering
a defense mechanism.

954
01:14:50.799 --> 01:14:53.719
Don't listen, General! Destroy the monster
while we still have the chance!

955
01:14:56.005 --> 01:14:58.405
General, you shoot and the whole thing
starts all over again.

956
01:14:58.474 --> 01:15:01.034
- Stop it now! Our future's at stake!
- Orders, sir?

957
01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:03.304
Which is why you have got to stop!

958
01:15:03.479 --> 01:15:06.711
- It's getting closer! Orders, sir?
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

959
01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:09.477
- Hogarth!
- Hold your fire! The boy's alive?

960
01:15:09.651 --> 01:15:10.971
It's a trick! Launch the missile.

961
01:15:11.053 --> 01:15:12.919
Are you mad, Mansley?

962
01:15:13.088 --> 01:15:14.716
All units, stand down!

963
01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:16.916
Rogard to Nautilus. Come in, Nautilus.

964
01:15:17.092 --> 01:15:18.890
This is Nautilus standing by.

965
01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:20.324
Launch the missile now!

966
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:31.038
That missile is targeted
to the giant's current position!

967
01:15:31.507 --> 01:15:33.237
Where's the giant, Mansley?

968
01:15:33.842 --> 01:15:37.404
What... Oh...

969
01:15:37.579 --> 01:15:40.014
We can duck and cover.
There's a fallout shelter right there.

970
01:15:40.182 --> 01:15:42.845
There's no way to survive this, you idiot!

971
01:15:43.018 --> 01:15:44.884
You mean, we're all going to...

972
01:15:45.054 --> 01:15:48.422
To die, Mansley, for our country.

973
01:15:49.525 --> 01:15:52.586
Screw our country! I want to live!

974
01:15:58.067 --> 01:15:59.194
Hold him, men.

975
01:15:59.368 --> 01:16:02.566
Make sure he stays here,
like a good soldier.

976
01:16:06.275 --> 01:16:07.436
Oh!

977
01:16:10.646 --> 01:16:13.206
Oh, no.

978
01:16:16.085 --> 01:16:18.418
- Hmm?
- It's a missile.

979
01:16:18.587 --> 01:16:22.957
When it comes down
everyone will die.

980
01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:24.491
There it is!

981
01:16:40.676 --> 01:16:43.612
- Shouldn't we get to a shelter?
- It wouldn't matter.

982
01:16:44.246 --> 01:16:46.408
I fix.

983
01:16:53.088 --> 01:16:54.351
Giant?

984
01:16:58.527 --> 01:17:00.086
Hogarth.

985
01:17:01.196 --> 01:17:03.825
You stay.

986
01:17:04.766 --> 01:17:07.463
I go.

987
01:17:12.441 --> 01:17:15.969
No following.

988
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:26.853
I love you.

989
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:57.216
You are who you choose to be.

990
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:02.556
Superman.

991
01:18:34.523 --> 01:18:35.957
Let's go home.

992
01:19:22.872 --> 01:19:25.967
Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.

993
01:19:26.142 --> 01:19:28.543
You think this is my best? Really?

994
01:19:28.712 --> 01:19:32.479
Well, you know,
next to that bug, uh, thing.

995
01:19:32.649 --> 01:19:35.983
You know, the one with the, uh, shovels...

996
01:19:36.152 --> 01:19:40.112
Um, Hogarth?
Come on, honey. Time to go.

997
01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:43.055
- See you later, guys.
- See you later, Hogarth.

998
01:19:43.226 --> 01:19:45.627
Oh, hey, Hogarth, um,
the General sent this to you.

999
01:19:45.795 --> 01:19:46.990
What is it?

1000
01:19:47.163 --> 01:19:49.564
He said it was
the only part recovered.

1001
01:19:49.966 --> 01:19:51.992
He thought you should have it.

1002
01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:55.563
I miss him.

1003
01:20:44.788 --> 01:20:46.222
See you later!
