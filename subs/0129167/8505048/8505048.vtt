Guess what I found?

Hogarth, we've been
through this before.

No pets.

36
00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.927
Oh, but he's not a pet, mom.
He's a friend.

37
00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.996

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:23.002
You'll never know he's there.
I'll keep him in a cage.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.203
Until you feel sorry for him

42
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.639

Please, mom,
at least look at him.

- Please don't move, sir.

62
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:19.091
My pet's under your table.
Don't look!

63
00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:21.961
If you make a scene,
my mom won't let me keep him.

64
00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:23.395
What kind of pet, kid?

65
00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:25.464
A squirrel. But don't worry.
He's friendly.

66
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.968
I'm telling the truth, dang it.
It came from outer space.

67
00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:30.102
I saw it.

68
00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.972
And it was headed toward land.

69
00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:35.975
I called the government
in Washington about it.

70
00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:37.409
M-m-maybe it was a Sputnik.

71
00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:39.478
Or a, uh-uh-uh,
an invader from Mars.

72
00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:40.713
That's, that's,
that's what it is.

73
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.548
'It's an invader from Mars!'

74
00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:44.650
It was, uh-uh,
a spaceship of some kind.

75
00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.351
Uh, an unidentified
flying object--

76
00:04:46.418 --> 00:04:47.619
Unidentified?

77
00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:48.654
Knowing you, Earl, I'd say

78
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.355
it was either whiskey or beer.

[all laughing]

80
00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:58.331
Hey. I saw it, too.

81
00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:01.401
I rest my case.

Ah!

84
00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:08.274
I believe you.

85
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.175
What if it is Sputnik?

86
00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:13.012
Or a flying saucer from Mars?

87
00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:15.047
I bet we could find it.

88
00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.148
Sorry, kid.

89
00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.784
I didn't really see anything.

90
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.119
But if we don't stick up
for the kooks, who will?

91
00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:22.487
Is my son bothering you, sir?

Uh, Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?

97
00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:35.034
I will, mom, right after
I finish talking with..

98
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.202
- Dean.
- Dean.

I'm trying
not to wig out here.

104
00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:47.412
- Don't wig out.
- Okay.

105
00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.115
He's headin' north now.

106
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:50.983
I'm sorry, kid.

107
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.618
I'd like to apologize
to everyone

108
00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.420

and some carrots.

365
00:21:47.738 --> 00:21:51.409
I am now the luckiest kid
in America!

366
00:21:51.475 --> 00:21:52.710
This is unbelievable.

367
00:21:52.777 --> 00:21:54.613
This is the greatest
discovery since..

368
00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:57.482
I don't know,
television or something!

369
00:21:57.549 --> 00:22:00.018
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some..

370
00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:01.520
No, they'll panic.

371
00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:03.188
People always wig out
and start shooting

372
00:22:03.254 --> 00:22:04.723
when they see
something big like you.

373
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.359
- Hmm?
- Oh, wig out. It means crazy.

374
00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:09.828
You know, like, uh..

375
00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:11.963
[gibberish]

376
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.064
[gibberish]

377
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:14.933
No, no, no! Don't do that!

378
00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:17.602
That's the kind of stuff
that makes them shoot at ya.

379
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:20.104
Two nights ago,
at approximately 1900 hours

380
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:23.541
sat com radar detected
an unidentified object

381
00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:24.943
entering Earth's atmosphere.

382
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.244
Losing contact with it
two and a half miles

383
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:28.646
off the coast of Rockwell.

384
00:22:28.713 --> 00:22:30.315
Some assumed
it was a large meteor

385
00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:31.683
or a downed satellite.

386
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.551
But my office in Washington

387
00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:35.053
received a call
from someone who reported

388
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.089
an actual encounter
with the object.

389
00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:41.126
This is no meteor, gentlemen.

390
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:44.729
This is something
much more serious. So..

391
00:22:44.795 --> 00:22:46.631
So, we can't call
"Ripley's Believe It or Not"

392
00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:49.201
because
they wouldn't believe it.

393
00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:50.669
And, uh..

394
00:22:50.735 --> 00:22:52.570
Oh, it's gettin' dark

395
00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:54.238
and if I don't get home soon

396
00:22:54.305 --> 00:22:55.840
mom's gonna wonder where I am.

397
00:22:55.907 --> 00:22:58.076
And if she comes
looking for me and sees you

398
00:22:58.142 --> 00:23:00.612
then we got
the screaming problem again.

399
00:23:00.679 --> 00:23:04.382
So, for now, w-would you,
you know, just..

400
00:23:04.448 --> 00:23:06.918
Just stay here, okay?

401
00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.421
I'll come back tomorrow.

402
00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:15.060
Wow.

403
00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:17.929
Well, goodbye.

404
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:21.666
[footsteps thumping]

405
00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:23.101
No, no.

406
00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:24.703
Me go.

407
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.171
You stay.

408
00:23:26.237 --> 00:23:27.873
No following.

409
00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.042
Good.

410
00:23:31.109 --> 00:23:32.310
[footsteps thumping]

411
00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:34.145
I told you!

412
00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:37.816
I'll come back tomorrow!

413
00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:39.684
Now, stay!

414
00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:44.188
[footsteps thumping]

415
00:23:44.255 --> 00:23:46.424
'No, no, no!'

416
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.493
'Bad robot!'

417
00:23:56.367 --> 00:23:59.504
[footsteps thumping]

418
00:24:02.106 --> 00:24:04.542
Look, you can't go
stomping around

419
00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:06.377
and you can't come with me.

420
00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:08.880
My mom will wig out.

421
00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:09.981
[gibberish]

422
00:24:10.047 --> 00:24:12.784
That's right,
so you have got to stay

423
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.520
in the forest and I'll bring
you some food tomorrow.

424
00:24:16.587 --> 00:24:21.159
But I gotta go home now.

425
00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:23.695
So, goodbye.

426
00:24:27.932 --> 00:24:29.467
[clanking]

427
00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:31.837
- Hm..
- Hey.

428
00:24:33.671 --> 00:24:37.141
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?

429
00:24:37.208 --> 00:24:39.110
Look at this mess!

430
00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:40.812
[bell ringing]

431
00:24:43.581 --> 00:24:44.882
[train whistle blowing]

432
00:24:44.949 --> 00:24:47.318
Oh, no.

433
00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:48.486
Put it back!

434
00:24:48.552 --> 00:24:50.555
Put it back right now!

435
00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:54.693
Help me! I need your help!

436
00:24:57.128 --> 00:24:58.597
Good, good!

437
00:25:01.432 --> 00:25:03.868
[train whistle blowing]

438
00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:05.870
Okay, put them together.
See, like this.

439
00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:08.973
This one here, that one there.

440
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.409
Okay, over, over.
Good, good.

441
00:25:11.476 --> 00:25:13.478
Now the other one.

442
00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:15.680
Okay. Good enough. Let's go!

443
00:25:18.282 --> 00:25:20.852
What the..

444
00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:24.355
That's fine! Leave it alone!
The train is coming!

445
00:25:24.421 --> 00:25:26.691
'The train is coming!'

446
00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:29.060
Come on, let's go!

447
00:25:33.397 --> 00:25:35.033
[crash]

448
00:25:41.205 --> 00:25:42.674
[crash]

449
00:25:43.307 --> 00:25:45.543
thud thud thud

450
00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:49.948
Oh, no, no, no, no.

451
00:25:50.014 --> 00:25:52.116
[screams]

452
00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.652
You're alive!

453
00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:58.757
[beeping]

454
00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:07.265
(male #3)
'Hello? Anybody out there?'

455
00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:10.335
- Oh, we're in trouble now.
- 'Are you alright?'

456
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:12.403
Look, I changed my mind.
You can follow me home.

457
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.737
Okay? Let's go.

458
00:26:13.804 --> 00:26:14.873
[telephone ringing]

459
00:26:14.939 --> 00:26:16.707
Ahem. Mayor's office.

460
00:26:16.774 --> 00:26:19.110
What? A train accident?

461
00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:21.112
'What do you mean,
he hit a giant creature?'

462
00:26:21.178 --> 00:26:22.881
What creature
could be big enough to..

463
00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:25.683
I need your car.

464
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.886
[tires squealing]

465
00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:36.261

[beeping]

468
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.758
Hm.

469
00:27:07.825 --> 00:27:11.029
Wow! You can fix yourself?

470
00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:12.196
Neat-o. Huh!

471
00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:14.499
Uh-oh! Mom's home.
J-just stay here, okay?

472
00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.034
I'll be back. Bye!

473
00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:19.971
Bye. Hm?

474
00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.908
[indistinct chatter]

475
00:27:27.778 --> 00:27:30.281
(Mansley)
What happened here?

476
00:27:30.348 --> 00:27:33.818
Go on.
Tell him what you saw, Frank.

477
00:27:34.852 --> 00:27:37.889
You're not gonna
believe this, but, uh

478
00:27:37.955 --> 00:27:42.260
it was a giant metal man.

479
00:27:46.363 --> 00:27:49.367
Does anyone know where I can
get to a telephone nearby?

480
00:27:53.504 --> 00:27:55.440
Would you say grace, please?

481
00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.414
Oh, my God!

482
00:28:03.647 --> 00:28:05.216
Um, uh..

483
00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:07.218
Oh, my God..

484
00:28:07.284 --> 00:28:10.088
...we, uh, thank you

485
00:28:10.154 --> 00:28:12.256
for the..

486
00:28:12.323 --> 00:28:14.659
...food that mom

487
00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.260
has put in front of us and..

488
00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:18.296
Stop!

489
00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:20.598
The, uh, the devil

490
00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:24.335
from doing bad things
and, uh..

491
00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.004
Get out of here!

492
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.638
Uh..

493
00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.607
Satan?

494
00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:31.309
Go! Go!

495
00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:35.947
So, that we may
live in peace. Amen.

496
00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.549
Amen.

497
00:28:37.615 --> 00:28:41.552
That was, hm,
really unusual, Hogarth.

498
00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:45.323
- Forgot to wash my hands.
- Well, uh.. Okay.

499
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.857

Stop, stop, stop!

505
00:29:00.004 --> 00:29:02.140
Alright. Come on.
Come on. Over here.

506
00:29:05.142 --> 00:29:06.111
Oh.

[grunting]

508
00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.249
Alright, uh.. Yeah.

[clanking]

510
00:29:17.454 --> 00:29:18.757
Oh!

511
00:29:20.124 --> 00:29:22.260
Come on. Come on,
over here. Come on. Yeah.

512
00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:26.497
Hey there, scout.
Kent Mansley.

513
00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:28.465
I work for the government.

514
00:29:28.532 --> 00:29:30.301
- Huh!
- 'Hogarth?'

515

(Annie)
'Hogarth?'

518
00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:36.940
Hey there, scout.
Kent Mansley.

519
00:29:37.007 --> 00:29:38.675
Work for the government.
Your parents home?

520
00:29:38.742 --> 00:29:40.744
- We're eating.
- Mm, boy.

521
00:29:40.811 --> 00:29:42.780
Who's there, honey?

522
00:29:42.847 --> 00:29:44.214
Well, hello there. Ahem.

523
00:29:44.281 --> 00:29:45.683
Do you have a telephone
I could use?

524
00:29:45.749 --> 00:29:47.618
Yes, there's one
in the kitchen.

525
00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:50.287
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

526
00:29:50.354 --> 00:29:52.824
Here.
Pretend you're a gangster.

527
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.525
[chuckles]

528
00:29:54.592 --> 00:29:56.661
Damn it, Mansley.
You call me at home for this?

529
00:29:56.727 --> 00:29:59.830
You don't understand, sir.
It-it-it ate my car.

530
00:29:59.897 --> 00:30:01.699
(Rogard)
'And you saw this happen?'

531
00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.634
No, I didn't actually see it.

532
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.436
It went off into the woods.

533
00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:07.137
'So, you don't
have any evidence?'

534
00:30:07.204 --> 00:30:09.607
Uh.. But-but, sir,
I've got an eyewitness!

535
00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:10.942
An eyewitness with a concussion.

536
00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:12.876
This thing..

537
00:30:12.943 --> 00:30:14.111
This thing is a menace.

538
00:30:14.178 --> 00:30:16.915
It-it, it tore up
the power station. It..

539
00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.983
- It caused a train wreck!
- 'What did?'

540
00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:20.451
Tell me again, Mansley

541
00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:22.386
and this time
listen to yourself.

542
00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:24.455
[sighs]

543
00:30:24.521 --> 00:30:26.691
A giant metal monster.

544
00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:28.726
[Rogard laughing]

545
00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:31.796
Please, sir, I've got
a feeling about this one.

546
00:30:31.862 --> 00:30:33.197
'That's lovely, Kent.'

547
00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:35.266
'But let me try to explain
how this works.'

548
00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:39.203
If you told me you'd found,
say, a, a giant footprint

549
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.039
I might send over an expert
to make a plaster cast of it.

550
00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:43.674
Hell, you get me
a photograph of this thing

551
00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:45.876
and I could probably
get some troops over there.

552
00:30:45.943 --> 00:30:48.813
But you tell me
you've got a feeling.

553
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.915
Alright then, fine.
You want evidence?

554
00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:52.483
I'll get you evidence.

555
00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.552
And when I do, I'm gonna
wanna a memo distributed.

556
00:30:55.619 --> 00:30:56.754
That sounds swell, Kent.

557
00:30:56.821 --> 00:30:58.822
'I'm gonna want
that memo carbon copied'

558
00:30:58.889 --> 00:31:01.459
and redistributed and..

559
00:31:07.831 --> 00:31:09.634
[indistinct shouting]

560
00:31:10.834 --> 00:31:13.004
[panting]

561
00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:14.839
[inhales deeply]

562
00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:18.009
Hi. Thanks
for the use of your phone.

563
00:31:18.076 --> 00:31:20.745
Well, thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs..

564
00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.546
Hughes. Annie Hughes.

565
00:31:22.613 --> 00:31:24.147
And this is my son, Hogarth.

566
00:31:24.214 --> 00:31:26.684
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

567
00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:29.253
That's Hogarth!

568
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.288
[engine starts]
Hogarth.

569
00:31:31.355 --> 00:31:32.657
What an embarrassing name.

570
00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.591
Might as well call him
Zeppo or something.

571
00:31:34.658 --> 00:31:37.996
What kind of a sick person
would name a kid Hogar..

572
00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:40.898
'Hog, Hug..'

573
00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:43.100
Hog, Hug. Hogarth Hughes!

574
00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:44.969
[tires screeching]

575
00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:46.337
[knock on door]

576
00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:49.773
Kent Mansley.
You work for the government.

577
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.209
I wasn't gonna say that.

578
00:31:52.276 --> 00:31:54.712
I have something
for you, Hogarth.

579
00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.047
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?

580
00:31:57.114 --> 00:31:58.515
Up at the power station.

581
00:31:58.582 --> 00:32:00.284
Hogarth was out there
the other night.

582
00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:01.585
Really?

583
00:32:01.652 --> 00:32:04.055
See anything unusual, Hogarth?

584
00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:09.427
No...thing unusual, really.

585
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:13.197
[toilet flushes]

586
00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:16.267
Gotta use the bathroom.

587
00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:22.606
[door creaking]

588
00:32:22.673 --> 00:32:23.841
[gasps]

589
00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.643
Strange he's so
tight-lipped now.

590
00:32:25.709 --> 00:32:27.445
And the other night
he couldn't stop talking.

591
00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:29.747
I mean, 100-foot robots
and whatnot.

592
00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:31.782
[chuckles]
A 100-foot robot?

593
00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:34.919
[laughing]
That's nutty!

594
00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:37.254
- What else did he say?
- 'No, wait, stop!'

595
00:32:37.321 --> 00:32:38.890
thud

596
00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:40.258
Excuse me.

597
00:32:41.425 --> 00:32:43.361
[grunting]

598
00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:48.099
Hogarth?
What is going on in there?

599
00:32:48.165 --> 00:32:50.167
[grunting]

600
00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:52.002
- Are you alright?
- 'Urgh!'

601
00:32:52.069 --> 00:32:53.504
(Hogarth)
'I'm fine.'

602
00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:55.273
You know,
this sort of thing is why

603
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.609
it's so important
to really chew your food.

604
00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:01.612
[Hogarth grunting]

605
00:33:04.648 --> 00:33:06.116
Hogarth?

606
00:33:06.183 --> 00:33:07.618
- Hogarth?
- Mom!

607
00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:09.720
- A little privacy!
- Aah! Sorry.

608
00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:11.789
- Ow! Ha-ha. Ow.
- Sorry.

609
00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:14.458
Oh, Lord, he's been
acting strange lately.

610
00:33:14.525 --> 00:33:15.525
That hurt.

611
00:33:15.592 --> 00:33:17.061
[sighs]

612
00:33:21.031 --> 00:33:22.367
[rumbling]

613
00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:25.236
thud

614
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.106
Thank you again, Annie.

615
00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.309
Goodnight, Hogarth.

616
00:33:31.375 --> 00:33:33.944
I'm sure we'll see
each other again real soon.

617
00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:35.346
[engine starts]

618
00:33:41.885 --> 00:33:43.387
If you're gonna stay here

619
00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:46.623
you gotta keep
better track of yourself.

620
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.159
Sheesh!

621
00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:50.294
Anyway, I thought you'd like

622
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.930
you know, a bedtime story
or something.

623
00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:56.133
I've got some
really cool ones.

624
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.803
"MAD Magazine," very funny.

625
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.907
"The Spirit," very cool.

626
00:34:02.974 --> 00:34:04.542
"Boy's Life," eh..

627
00:34:04.608 --> 00:34:05.910
Oh, here.

628
00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:09.013
This guy is Superman.

629
00:34:09.079 --> 00:34:10.614
Sure, he's famous now

630
00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.883
but he started off
just like you.

631
00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:14.817
- Hmm.
- Crash-landed on Earth.

632
00:34:14.885 --> 00:34:16.754
Didn't know what he was doing

633
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:20.558
but he only uses
his powers for good

634
00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:22.626
never for evil.

635
00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.495
Remember that.

636
00:34:27.164 --> 00:34:28.466
Hm?

637
00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:32.369
Oh, that's Atomo,
the metal menace.

638
00:34:32.436 --> 00:34:35.039
'He's not the hero.
He's the villain.'

639
00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:37.107
He's not like you.

640
00:34:37.174 --> 00:34:39.543
You're a good guy.

641
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:40.978
Like Superman.

642
00:34:41.043 --> 00:34:43.513
Superman.

643
00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:46.817
[stomach growling]

644
00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:48.886
Oh, you're hungry,
aren't you?

645
00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:50.121
Mm-hm.

646
00:34:50.187 --> 00:34:52.657
But I don't have
any metal here.

647
00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:55.093
Just follow me.

648
00:34:56.726 --> 00:34:58.095
Pick me up, okay?

649
00:34:58.162 --> 00:34:59.564
[grunts]

650
00:35:07.137 --> 00:35:08.773
Wow.

651
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.908
Okay, now, march!

652
00:35:11.975 --> 00:35:13.210
[grunts]

653
00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:15.613
[footsteps thumping]

654
00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:18.249
Whoo!

655
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.389
(Hogarth)
Yee-haw!

656
00:35:31.895 --> 00:35:33.864
- Hm?
- Oh, yeah.

657
00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:35.032
That's Rockwell.

658
00:35:35.098 --> 00:35:37.701
- Nice place, huh?
- Rockwell?

659
00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:40.437
Yes, I was born
right down there.

660
00:35:40.504 --> 00:35:42.272
- Rockwell!
- No..

661
00:35:42.339 --> 00:35:44.141
(Hogarth)
Stop!

662
00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:46.443
No, stop! Look out for the cow!

663
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.478
Come on, no, no, not there!

664
00:35:48.545 --> 00:35:51.449
Please stop. No, no, stop!

665
00:35:53.984 --> 00:35:55.653
We can't go there yet.

666
00:35:55.719 --> 00:35:58.723
People just aren't ready
for you.

667
00:35:59.923 --> 00:36:02.860

[footsteps thumping]

669
00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.403
That was close.

670
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.205
We can't go running
around like that, okay?

671
00:36:15.272 --> 00:36:17.774
- Hm.
- Hey, look!

672
00:36:17.841 --> 00:36:19.610
Hm?

673
00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:23.147
Uh, I guess
that would be okay to eat.

674
00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:24.615
It's been there for months.

675
00:36:24.681 --> 00:36:25.749
[blabbers]

676
00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:28.285
Oh, no. We gotta hide!

677
00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:29.587
You know, hide?

678
00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:31.923
It's when you..
You know, when you..

679
00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.925
Just get behind something,
quick!

680
00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:39.931
Don't move.

Alright, who's out there?

[panting]

702
00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.209
Hey, hey, I know you.

703
00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:01.378
- Squirrel boy.
- Hogarth.

704
00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:03.180
By night, known as Hogarth.

705
00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:06.583
Got it.
Well, come on inside, kid.

706
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:08.585
'Sorry about the crowbar.'

707
00:38:08.652 --> 00:38:11.688
'You'd be surprised how many
people wanna steal scrap.'

'But, man,
once I turn it into art'

709
00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.525
'I-I-I can't give it away.'

710
00:38:15.592 --> 00:38:17.127
'I mean, what am I?'

711
00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:18.596
'A junkman who sells art'

00:38:18.662 --> 00:38:20.964

who sells junk?'

713
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.166
'You tell me.'

714
00:38:22.232 --> 00:38:25.602
(Hogarth)
I like it, I think.

715
00:38:25.669 --> 00:38:29.740
Listen, you're, you're not
gonna call my mom, are you?

716
00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:31.608
She doesn't know I'm out. I..

717
00:38:31.675 --> 00:38:33.443
Don't worry, kid,
look, it's not my style

718
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.245
to report a guy
to the authorities.

719
00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:36.580
[gibberish]

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:37.948

What do you want, some,
uh, milk or what?

722
00:38:41.485 --> 00:38:43.487
- Milk?
- Coffee's fine.

723
00:38:44.755 --> 00:38:47.791
[scoffs]
Yeah. I drink it. I'm hip.

724
00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:49.093
I don't know.

725
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.161
This is espresso, you know?

726
00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:52.830
It's like coffee-zilla.

727
00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:55.099
I said, I'm hip.

728
00:38:57.935 --> 00:38:59.569
So she moved me up a grade
because I wasn't fitting in.

729
00:38:59.636 --> 00:39:01.038
So, now I'm even more
not fitting in.

730
00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:02.673
I was getting good grades.
You know, like all As.

731
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.041
So, my mom says,
"You need stimulation."

732
00:39:04.107 --> 00:39:05.842
And I go, "No, I'm
stimulated enough right now."

733
00:39:05.909 --> 00:39:07.310
- That's for sure.
- So, she goes..

734
00:39:07.377 --> 00:39:08.312
"Uh-uh, you don't
have a challenge.

735
00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:09.380
You need a challenge."

736
00:39:09.446 --> 00:39:10.648
So, now I'm challenged,
alright.

737
00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:12.416
I'm challenged to hold on
to my lunch money

738
00:39:12.482 --> 00:39:14.151
because of all the big mooses
who wanna pound me

739
00:39:14.217 --> 00:39:16.320
because I'm a shrimpy dork who
thinks he's smarter than them.

740
00:39:16.386 --> 00:39:18.656
But I don't think I'm smarter.
I just do the stupid homework.

741
00:39:18.722 --> 00:39:20.191
If everyone else just did
the stupid homework

742
00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:21.625
they could move up a grade
and get pounded too.

743
00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:22.893
Is there anymore coffee?

744
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.428
Look, it-it's really
none of my business, kid

745
00:39:25.495 --> 00:39:27.197
but, um, w-who cares

746
00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:29.266
what these creeps think,
you know?

747
00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.067
They don't decide who you are.

748
00:39:31.134 --> 00:39:32.102
You do.

749
00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:35.639
You are who you choose to be.

750
00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:38.842
[clattering]

751
00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:41.579
- Did you hear that?
- No, wait. Stop!

752
00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:47.685
[dramatic music]

753
00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:52.857
[chomping]

754
00:39:53.857 --> 00:39:55.392
- It's okay!
- My God!

755
00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:58.095
- He isn't gonna--
- Run, kid! Run!

756
00:39:59.996 --> 00:40:01.498
thud

757
00:40:01.564 --> 00:40:02.732
It's okay. He isn't..

758
00:40:02.799 --> 00:40:04.334
thud

759
00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.702
It's okay.
He isn't gonna hurt me.

760
00:40:05.769 --> 00:40:08.038
- Oh, hey..
- Don't squash him!

761
00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.206
No! Don't..

762
00:40:09.272 --> 00:40:10.607
'Do not..'

763
00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:13.043
...squash him.

764
00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:15.345
'His name is Dean.'

765
00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:17.081
'We like Dean.'

766
00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:20.384
- Dean.
- Oh!

767
00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:23.721
[shivering]
So.. Where'd, uh..

768
00:40:23.787 --> 00:40:25.522
Where'd he come from?

769
00:40:25.588 --> 00:40:27.190
He doesn't remember.

770
00:40:27.257 --> 00:40:29.559
He's like a little kid.

771
00:40:29.626 --> 00:40:31.195
Little. Yeah.

772
00:40:31.261 --> 00:40:32.462
[chuckles]

773
00:40:32.529 --> 00:40:34.698
Wait a minute.
You can talk to him?

774
00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.900
Kinda, he can't say
a lot of words yet

775
00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:39.002
but he understands
things pretty good.

776
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:41.004
Oh, yeah. I see.

777
00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:43.541
[both chuckling]

778
00:40:45.208 --> 00:40:47.845
He needs food and shelter.

779
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.459
(Hogarth)
'You got plenty of room here.'

780
00:41:02.526 --> 00:41:05.062
- This place is perfect.
- 'Go away.'

781
00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.598
I can have him
push the door down.

782
00:41:07.664 --> 00:41:09.299
- You know I can.
- 'Hogarth.'

783
00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:11.301
I-I can't hide it here.

784
00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:13.570
- Him, not it.
- Whatever.

785
00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.739
You don't even know
where he came from.

786
00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:18.141
Or-or what the hell he is!

787
00:41:18.208 --> 00:41:20.010
He is my friend.

788
00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.479
Yeah, yeah, what am I?

789
00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:23.513
Am I your friend?

790
00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:24.781
Bring some Franken-bot

791
00:41:24.848 --> 00:41:26.216
with out-of-state plates
over here

792
00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:28.051
make me change my tune.

793
00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:29.319
I don't like that jazz.

794
00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:31.088
God, I'm tired.

795
00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.990
So, he can stay?

796
00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:35.625
Tonight.
Tomorrow, I-I don't know.

797
00:41:35.692 --> 00:41:38.229
'I don't know about tomorrow.'

798
00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.763
[exhales]

799
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.272
Sleep tight.

800
00:41:48.338 --> 00:41:50.274
I'll see ya tomorrow.

801
00:41:53.243 --> 00:41:56.180
[groaning]

802
00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:06.623
- You're up already?
- Just making the bed.

803
00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.325
Well, that's nice,
well, come downstairs

804
00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:09.860
I have a surprise for you.

805
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:13.597
[grumbling]

806
00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:17.500
Morning, sport. Sleep well?

807
00:42:17.567 --> 00:42:19.836
Mom?

808
00:42:19.903 --> 00:42:21.671
Isn't it wonderful, Hogarth?

809
00:42:21.738 --> 00:42:23.206
We finally rented our room.

810
00:42:23.273 --> 00:42:26.043
Ugh! I'm not very hungry.

811
00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.252
Oh! Yeah.

812
00:42:36.319 --> 00:42:37.821
[telephone ringing]

813
00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.990
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes
speaking. Who's calling, please?

814
00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:42.493
I said he could stay
the night, kid.

815
00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:43.726
Uh, it's morning now.

816
00:42:43.793 --> 00:42:45.795
Look, I'll try
to come over, okay?

817
00:42:45.862 --> 00:42:47.297
But there's this weird guy
here who's watching me.

818
00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:49.833
(Dean)
'What? What's that
supposed to mean?'

819
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.236
I got, I got this big, giant

820
00:42:52.302 --> 00:42:53.536
giant thing out here.

821
00:42:53.603 --> 00:42:54.938
I-I can't talk
right now, okay?

822
00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:56.306
- 'Hogarth!'
- Bye.

823
00:42:56.373 --> 00:42:58.675
Now, who was that, sport?
Friend of yours?

824
00:42:58.741 --> 00:43:00.577
Yeah. He's, uh, a new kid.

825
00:43:00.644 --> 00:43:02.179
Wha-what, I..

826
00:43:02.245 --> 00:43:03.646
Hey, hey! Hey, stop!

827
00:43:03.713 --> 00:43:05.849
Stop that! Stop it!

828
00:43:06.916 --> 00:43:07.918
Hey, mind if I ask you

829
00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.719
a few questions there, buckaroo?

830
00:43:09.786 --> 00:43:11.288
Now, why would you
tell your mom

831
00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:12.956
about a giant robot, slugger?

832
00:43:13.022 --> 00:43:14.791
Say, what'd you see at
the power station, huh, tiger?

833
00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:15.892
You tell anyone else
about this, buddy?

834
00:43:15.959 --> 00:43:17.394
How big is this thing, ranger?

835
00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:19.195
Been in the forest lately..
Hey, where you going? Champ?

836
00:43:19.262 --> 00:43:20.663
Slugger?
Hey, cowboy! Where you goin'?

837
00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:22.966
- Where you goin'?
- I'm goin' out!

838
00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:25.268
Ooh! Why don't you take
Mr. Mansley with you?

839
00:43:25.335 --> 00:43:28.171
- Show him the sights.
- Oh, mom! The sights?

840
00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:29.840
Hey, I'd love that,
give us a chance

841
00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:32.042
to get acquainted,
swap some stories, huh, chief?

842
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:34.511
There are two kinds
of metal in this yard.

843
00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:36.246
Scrap and art.

844
00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.848
If you gotta eat one of them,
eat the scrap.

845
00:43:38.915 --> 00:43:43.187
What you currently
have in your mouth is art!

846
00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:48.092
Mm. Hm. Art?

847
00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:52.830
[metal creaking]

848
00:43:54.097 --> 00:43:56.466
Oh, forget it. Forget it!

849
00:43:56.532 --> 00:43:59.669
It's gone. It's-it's..

850
00:43:59.736 --> 00:44:02.740
Hmm. That's not bad.

851
00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:07.577
(Hogarth)
First, you take a chocolate bar.

852
00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:08.678
Any bar'll do.

853
00:44:08.745 --> 00:44:10.547
- Oh.
- Do you mind if I, uh..

854
00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:12.249
No, knock yourself out,
skipper.

855
00:44:12.315 --> 00:44:15.819
You crumble up the chocolate
into little pieces.

856
00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:18.588
Then you kinda stir it
into the ice cream.

857
00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:20.123
- See?
- Yes, I see.

858
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.826
- What do you call this again?
- Landslide.

859
00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:27.631
- It's new. Very new.
- Mm, landslide.

860
00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:28.865
Top notch.

861
00:44:28.932 --> 00:44:31.535
Mm, you know, Hogarth

862
00:44:31.601 --> 00:44:35.105
we live in a strange
and wondrous time.

863
00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.740
The atomic age.

864
00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:39.777
But, there's a dark side
to progress, Hogarth.

865
00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:42.011
- Ever hear of Sputnik?
- Yeah.

866
00:44:42.078 --> 00:44:43.880
It's the first
satellite in space.

867
00:44:43.947 --> 00:44:46.283
Foreign satellite, Hogarth.

868
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.687
And all that that implies.
Even now, it orbits overhead.

869
00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:54.023
Boop. Boop. Watching us.

870
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.893
Mm. We can't see it,
but it's there.

871
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.662
Looks like that giant thing
in the woods.

872
00:44:59.729 --> 00:45:01.698
We don't know what it is
or what it can do.

873
00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:03.467
I don't feel safe, Hogarth.

874
00:45:03.533 --> 00:45:06.002
- Do you?
- What are you talkin' about?

875
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:07.537
What am I talking about?

876
00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:09.840
What am I talking about?

877
00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:12.409
I'm talking about your
god darned security, Hogarth!

878
00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.411
While you're snoozing
in your little jammies

879
00:45:14.477 --> 00:45:16.747
back in Washington
we're wide awake and worried.

880
00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:19.349
Why? Because everyone want's
what we have, Hogarth.

881
00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:21.484
Everyone! You think
this metal man is fun?

882
00:45:21.551 --> 00:45:24.487
But who built it? The Russians?
The Chinese? The Martians?

883
00:45:24.554 --> 00:45:26.190
Canadians? I don't care!

884
00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:27.858
All I know is
we didn't build it

885
00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:29.693
and that's reason enough
to assume the worst

886
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.328
and blow it to kingdom come!

887
00:45:31.394 --> 00:45:33.663
Now, you are going to tell me
about this thing.

888
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.897
You are going to lead me to it.

889
00:45:34.964 --> 00:45:36.433
And we are going to destroy it

890
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.767
before it destroys us!

891
00:45:37.834 --> 00:45:40.037
[stomach grumbling]

892
00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:42.338
Just hold that thought
and stay right there.

893
00:45:42.405 --> 00:45:43.773
Woo-ooh.

894
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.375

That sucks. Let me just..
U-up a little bit.

I not only have'

and we're running out of time.'

we should act.'

'Can you afford not to?'

1094
00:56:15.471 --> 00:56:18.207
Excellent, sir.
You won't regret it.

1095
00:56:18.273 --> 00:56:19.809
Well, thank you, sir.

Don't get cute.

1099
00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:41.097

is in our front yard,
Mr. Mansley.

- Alright, where is it?
- What?

1121
00:58:56.665 --> 00:58:58.301
You know darn well what.

1122
00:58:58.367 --> 00:59:01.070
The monster. The giant...thing.

1123
00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:03.238
The metal man.

1124
00:59:03.305 --> 00:59:06.142
Ah, the metal man.

1125
00:59:06.208 --> 00:59:08.211
Geez, you were, you were
scarin' me there for a second.

1126
00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:11.480
I thought I was
under a-attack or something.

1127
00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:12.848
Uh, he's in the back.

1128
00:59:12.915 --> 00:59:15.218
Come on. I'll-I'll show you.

1129
00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.692
You guys got here just in time.

1130
00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:25.594
This rich cat,
you know, some industrialist

1131
00:59:25.661 --> 00:59:27.964
wants him for the lobby
of his company.

1132
00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.166
He whipped out his checkbook
right on the spot.

1133
00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:33.469
I said, "Hey, you got him
for the rest of your life."

1134
00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:36.605
But, what, I gotta let go
the moment I give birth?

1135
00:59:36.672 --> 00:59:38.007
I mean, come on.

1136
00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.710
Give me some time
to cut the umbilical, man.

1137
00:59:41.677 --> 00:59:43.179
There he is.

00:59:49.651 --> 00:59:51.220
(Dean)
Anyway, I haven't sold him yet.

1141
00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:52.855
So if you really want him

1142
00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:55.625
and if, you know, you throw in

1143
00:59:55.691 --> 00:59:57.893
a competitive bid..

1144
00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.795
Sir, uh, I, listen..
Sir, listen--

1145
00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:02.765
- Step outside, Mansley.
- Yes, sir.

1146
01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.602
You realize how much hardware
I brought out here?

of Uncle Sam's dollars'

1149
01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.473
I gotta admit.

1150
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.308
I'm relieved that this is what

1151
01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:14.943
Hogarth was talkin' about.

1152
01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:18.581
I mean, I was beginning to,
um, think it was real.

1153
01:00:18.647 --> 01:00:20.116
[chuckles]

1154
01:00:20.182 --> 01:00:22.251
I mean, don't-don't
get me wrong, um, I like it.

1155
01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:25.520
Eh, but, uh, do you need
all this stuff o-on the surface?

1156
01:00:25.587 --> 01:00:30.025
- Well, um...no, actually.
- Well, um, it just sort of..

1157
01:00:30.092 --> 01:00:32.394
It-it-it seems
kind of slapped on.

1158
01:00:32.461 --> 01:00:34.931
You know, not as thought-out
as this other piece.

1159
01:00:34.997 --> 01:00:37.666
- Y-you like that one?
- Yeah.

1161
01:00:39.368 --> 01:00:41.169
You'll be chief inspector
of subway toilets

1162
01:00:41.236 --> 01:00:43.405
by the time
I'm finished with you!

1163
01:00:43.472 --> 01:00:44.607
Now, pack up.

1164
01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:45.741
I'll expect you back
in Washington

1165
01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:48.110
to clear out your office.

1166
01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:49.679
Yes, sir.

1167
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.516
Hmm. I see why Hogarth
sneaks out here.

1168
01:00:54.583 --> 01:00:56.753
You mean, you know about that?

1169
01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:59.389
Aw. Now I do.

so much destruction.

Atomo?

1184
01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:44.934
No Atomo.

Okay, Superman.

1188
01:01:57.446 --> 01:01:58.514

I mean it!

1206
01:02:47.696 --> 01:02:49.731
No, stop. Why?

1207
01:02:49.798 --> 01:02:51.833
It was an accident.
He's our friend.

1208
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.902
He's a piece of hardware,
Hogarth.

1209
01:02:53.969 --> 01:02:55.771
Why do you think
the army was here?

1210
01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:59.609
He's a weapon!
A-a big gun that-that walks!

to Hogarth!'

Come back!

It was defensive.

1220
01:03:26.935 --> 01:03:29.405

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:46.075

Hey, stop!
There's a kid in his hands!

1272
01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:01.991
'Stop shooting!'

1273
01:06:03.091 --> 01:06:05.360
Kent!
He only reacts defensively.

1274
01:06:05.427 --> 01:06:07.196
If you don't shoot,
he's harmless.

1275
01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.698
You gotta tell the general!

1276
01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:10.833
This is all your fault, beatnik.
If you hadn't--

1277
01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.935
Would you shut up and listen?
You've gotta make them stop.

1278
01:06:14.002 --> 01:06:16.805
The giant's got
the kid with him.

1279
01:06:16.871 --> 01:06:18.841
I'll take care of it.

1281
01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:25.047
He says
the monster's killed a kid.

1282
01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:28.016
Sir, we must stop it
at all costs.

1283
01:06:28.083 --> 01:06:31.687
Go to code red.
Repeat, code red!

1284
01:06:31.753 --> 01:06:34.723
Mr. President,
we have a situation, sir.

You can fly!

- Secure the area.
- 'Roger--'

1319
01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.778
Let's find out
what this thing is

1320
01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:38.414
and who sent it.

He's unconscious, but he's okay.
Let's get him in the car.

Drive, baby, drive!

We've hit it with everything
we've got!

1358
01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:27.656
Not everything, general.
The bomb.

1359
01:10:27.722 --> 01:10:29.390
The Nautilus has first
strike capability

1360
01:10:29.457 --> 01:10:31.460

You scare me, Mansley.

1362
01:10:32.961 --> 01:10:35.697
You want us to bomb ourselves
in order to kill it?

1363
01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:38.433
General, the giant seems
to follow whatever attacks it.

1364
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.402
We can lure it away
from the town

1365
01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:43.004
then destroy it.

1366
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:44.272
Radio the Nautilus.

1367
01:10:44.339 --> 01:10:45.440
Tell them to target the robot

1368
01:10:45.506 --> 01:10:48.076

1369
01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:51.046
This is Nautilus. What is
the giant's current position?

Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

01:10:59.988 --> 01:11:01.790
- Stop the car.
- Hogarth! Oh, my God!

1375
01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:04.026
- Honey, you're alright.
- Go back! We've gotta help him!

Are you crazy, kid?
You're lucky to be alive!

Everyone, out of the car!

1381
01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.272
- We have to evacuate the area.
- What are you talking about?

1382
01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.907
We gotta get this boy
to a hospital.

1383
01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.808
What boy?

1384
01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:22.311

My son is out there!

1396

No, wait. It's me, Hogarth.

1397
01:12:03.818 --> 01:12:05.287
Remember?

1398
01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.990
It's bad to kill.

1399
01:12:08.056 --> 01:12:09.525
Guns kill.

1400
01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:12.327
And you don't have
to be a gun.

1401
01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:15.230
You are what you choose to be.

1402

'You choose.'

1403
01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.902
Choose.

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:23.072

It's okay. It's okay.

1408
01:12:32.814 --> 01:12:34.316
We gotta show them
you're good.

Nautilus to Rogard,

1411

What are you saying,
he's friendly?

1412
01:12:42.757 --> 01:12:45.493
Yes. Attacking him is
triggering a defense mechanism.

1413
01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.462
Don't listen, general,
destroy the monster

1414
01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:49.030
while we still have the chance!

General, you shoot now
and the whole thing

starts all over again.

1418
01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:55.103
Stop it now, general.
Our future is at stake.

1419
01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.438
Orders, sir?

1420
01:12:56.504 --> 01:12:58.406
Which is why
you've gotta stop, general!

1421
01:12:58.473 --> 01:13:00.475
It's getting closer!
Orders, sir?

1422
01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.411
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Hogarth!

1423
01:13:02.477 --> 01:13:04.379
Hold your fire!
The boy's alive?

1424
01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:05.881
It's a trick!
Launch the missile.

1425
01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.983
Are you mad, Mansley?

1426
01:13:08.049 --> 01:13:09.617
All units, stand down!

1427
01:13:09.684 --> 01:13:11.686

That missile is targeted

Where's the giant, Mansley?

1433

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.848
You mean, we're all going to--

1439
01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.349
To die, Mansley

1440
01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:44.052
for our country.

1441
01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:45.520
Screw our country!

1442
01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.389
I wanna live!

(Rogard)
'Hold him, men.'

1446
01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:57.399
Make sure he stays here,
like a good soldier.

Oh, no.

1451
01:14:10.912 --> 01:14:11.980
Hmm?

1452
01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:13.281
It's a missile.

1453
01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:15.784
When it comes down..

1454
01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:17.852
...everyone will die.

Shouldn't we get to a shelter?

1459

It wouldn't matter.

(Iron Giant)
'I fix.'

1461
01:14:48.283 --> 01:14:49.718
Giant?

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:55.057
Hogarth.

1463
01:14:55.957 --> 01:14:58.994
You stay.

Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.

1482
01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:23.538
You think this is my best.
Really?

1483
01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:25.006
Well, y-you know

Ahem, um, Hogarth?

Come on, honey. Time to go.

Oh, hey, Hogarth, um,
the general sent this to you.

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:41.756
W-what is it?

1491
01:17:41.822 --> 01:17:44.559
He said it was
the only part recovered.

1492
01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.828
'He thought you should have it.'

1493
