Not in.
Not answering.

Hey, Lou.
How's your day going, huh?

342
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:41,645
I told you.
Good day, I'm okay
. Bad day, I'm okay.

these rumors,

it's impossible to get to
the bottom of this.

This could be
a 10-billion dollar

Or it could be
a 200-billion dollar hole

we can risk that money

from Treasury or the Fed.

I said knock it off, Lou.
Or this meeting is over,
you hear me?

justify a high price
for your company.

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,510
What are you, some kind of
energy freedom-fighter?

675
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,950
No, Mr. Gekko.
I'm in this game

676
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,022
to make money
like anybody else.

677
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,942
So what about money, Jake?

678
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,350
You like her?

679
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,751
Do I like...

680
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,311
"
I've never thought
about money as a "she.

681
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:57,751
Oh!

682
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:00,631
She lies there
in bed at night with you,

683
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:02,551
looking at you, one eye open.

684
00:36:05,703 --> 00:36:08,103
Money's a bitch
that never sleeps.

685
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,503
And she's jealous.

686
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,423
And if you don't
pay close attention,

687
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:15,783
you wake up in the morning,
and she might
be gone forever.

688
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:20,983
Respectfully,

689
00:36:20,983 --> 00:36:21,943
Mr. Gekko,
I don't want to end up

690
00:36:22,423 --> 00:36:23,383
where you are
because of money.

691
00:36:23,383 --> 00:36:25,592
Oh, yeah.
So marry it instead, right?

692
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:30,551
What do you mean?

693
00:36:31,992 --> 00:36:33,031
.
Winnie doesn't
have any money

694
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:37,783
Right.

695
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:40,072
Here I thought
you were a gold-digger.

696
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:43,591
Does Winnie know
you came to see me?

697
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:45,032
No.

698
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:48,344
Well, not exactly.
I was gonna tell her.

699
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:52,184
I don't think
that's a good idea, pal.

700
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:54,104
See, I got a feeling
you may want to
be seeing me again

701
00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:56,504
and if she knew
we had this little pow-wow,

702
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,312
she's not gonna
let it happen.

703
00:37:01,465 --> 00:37:03,385
You know what?
You're a smart kid.

704
00:37:03,864 --> 00:37:05,624
You should just walk away.
You never met me.

705
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:07,544
.
I don't understand

706
00:37:07,544 --> 00:37:08,504
I think...

707
00:37:08,504 --> 00:37:10,424
The man that
you loved like a father

708
00:37:10,424 --> 00:37:11,865
who threw himself
under a subway?

709
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:13,785
I think you're angrier
than you think you are.

710
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:16,665
And I think you wanna be
in the family business.

711
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:18,953
Which is what?

712
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:20,745
Payback.

713
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:22,665
Except I'm not
in that business anymore.

714
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:24,105
Because the one thing
I learned in jail

715
00:37:24,585 --> 00:37:27,465
is that money is not
the prime asset in life.

716
00:37:27,465 --> 00:37:28,425
Time is.

717
00:37:28,905 --> 00:37:30,233
And your time
is just about up.

718
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,425
Winnie needs to get past
the pain you caused her.

719
00:37:34,905 --> 00:37:36,345
I caused her?

720
00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:38,233
Look, she wants you
back in her life.

721
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:40,153
She just can't
handle it right now.

722
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:42,073
.
Okay? Maybe I can help

723
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:46,665
Maybe you can,
maybe you can. That's
what makes the market, Jake.

724
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,425
This is my station.

725
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:50,313
That is my email address.

726
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:02,425
By the way,
the rumors on Zabel?

727
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:03,866
Yeah?

728
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,786
It had to be someone
with enough clout
to be believed,

729
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:08,666
somebody who made a fortune
shorting the stock.

730
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,546
An axe to grind.

731
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:15,386
Word has it
that Bretton James
gutted Zabel at the Fed.

732
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:18,234
Just stuck that knife
right into his stomach.

733
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:26,746
Check out 2000.

734
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,475
The Internet bubble.

735
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,795
Churchill Schwartz,
they got hosed.

736
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:35,114
You know there's
fortunes to be made.

737
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:38,954
Hundreds of
millions of dollars
betting against this bubble.

738
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:40,395
Just wish I had a million.

739
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,746
AUDREY: It checks out, baby.

740
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:53,067
Thirteen banks
were approached in 2000
to rescue Churchill Schwartz.

741
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,715
Bretton James' division was over-invested

742
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:57,035
in the Internet
bubble collapse.

743
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,787
Each bank was going to
put up 100 million,
but Zabel said no.

744
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:01,115
Churchill Schwartz
almost went down

745
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:02,555
but was backstopped
by a conglomerate
of nine banks.

746
00:39:02,555 --> 00:39:04,475
Okay, so not only
did they survive this,

747
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:07,836
but they came back
and ate our
fricking lunch.

748
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:08,748
Moral hazard.

749
00:39:08,748 --> 00:39:10,716
Unbelievable.
The man's a hypocrite.

Hey, Doc.

753
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:19,196
I don't know, Jake.
We're on hold here.
Now they're telling me...

00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:21,116
Hold on just a second.

We'll have drinks.
Okay.

It's not over.
All right, Olaf?
Thank you.

757
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:25,435
Go ahead, Doc.

758
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:28,796
They're telling me
we have to cut staff.

759
00:39:28,796 --> 00:39:31,756
We went back to Third Boston,
and they turned us down.

760
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:34,556
And since your firm, um...

761
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:35,996
?
JAKE: Listen,
I totally understand, okay

762
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:38,396
But I think I can
keep this thing going
with minimal cutbacks.

763
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,188
Look, Jake.

764
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:42,588
I think we have to
have a face-to-face talk
with my people, because...

765
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,508
I totally agree, Doc.

766
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:45,789
It's just that I'm
walking into a critical
meeting right now. Okay?

Robby, what do you got

771
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,996
We got movement definitely
on Tuesday of that week.

772
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,268
There was some large shorts
from money out of
the Cayman Islands.

773
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,709
Something called
Locust Fund.

774
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:58,669
Locust Fund.

775
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:00,029
What else?

776
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:01,949
Wednesday, they traded
another 500,000 shares.

777
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:03,069
Monday, two million.

778
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:05,229
Tuesday, one million more.
Total of 3.5 million shares.

779
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:07,437
These guys made
some serious money.

780

Who is that, though?
Who is the Locust Fund

781
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:12,637
I don't know.
And I don't want to find out.
It could be my ass.

782
00:40:12,637 --> 00:40:15,469
It'll be your ass
if I tell your girlfriend
about the pumps and heels.

783
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:16,269
Which girlfriend?

784
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:18,189
Just find out, all right?
I got a hunch.

785
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:19,996
I hope it's better
than your last one.

Oh, yeah.

nationalize the oil.
I promise you.

Are you behind it?

No. Churchill Schwartz is.
They got a huge stake.

801
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,230
Can't get behind that size,
but you and your boys can.

take over the oil
like that?

position in this stock

to investment bank
Churchill Schwartz.

Home builder confidence
falls to a record low in July.

The monthly indicator
from the National
Association of Homebuilders

851
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:18,081
dropped for a third

This is going to be

Perfect for reading.

It'll get great light.

857
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:34,433
And there's
plenty of room
for a pool

858
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:37,313
or a tennis court. See?

859
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:40,674
What's going on with
Rainwater Road, Ma?

860
00:43:40,674 --> 00:43:42,113
I'm showing it
tomorrow.

great shopping,

Everybody loves it here.

866
00:43:53,362 --> 00:43:54,434
You ought to buy it.

(LAUGHS)

868
00:43:56,355 --> 00:43:58,354
There are
quite a few choices
on this block.

869

That's what I
love about you, dear.
You call it like you see it.

870
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:05,634
I'd rather have this
down payment any day.

871
00:44:08,275 --> 00:44:09,762
JAKE: Ma, you got
three properties.

872
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:10,722
Two of the loans
are resetting
in a few months.

873
00:44:11,203 --> 00:44:12,642
You got to sell at least one.

874
00:44:12,642 --> 00:44:14,562
Oh, don't tell me
my job, Jacob.

875
00:44:14,562 --> 00:44:16,963
There are no buyers
out there right now.

876
00:44:16,963 --> 00:44:18,883
The market's soft.
Everybody reads
the same news.

877
00:44:18,883 --> 00:44:20,803
I just gotta
wait it out.

878
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:22,723
It's like the two
Florida properties
five years ago.

879
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:26,563
I didn't get spooked,
and I flipped
190 grand from them.

What does Henry say?

881
00:44:30,403 --> 00:44:31,843
Oh, Henry.
Forget about him.
He's a wimp.

882
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:33,283
That's done?

883
00:44:33,763 --> 00:44:37,603
SYLVIA: Oh, if I listened to
Henry, I would have sold
every house way too soon.

884
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:39,523
He's just like
your father was.

885
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:40,963
No. Dad had bad luck.

886
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:42,884
He took a shot and he failed.
But he took a shot, Ma.

887
00:44:42,884 --> 00:44:45,283
Yeah, and then Jack
Daniels took his shot,
and he succeeded.

888
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,724
Can we not
have an argument
about my father

889
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:47,684
every time I
come to see you?

890
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:50,516

So sensitive.
Forget I said anything

891
00:44:50,516 --> 00:44:54,835

God. Defending your father
is like defending smallpox

892
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:57,236
Look.

893
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:02,516
The developers are
on my ass, okay? I just
need you to bridge me.

894
00:45:02,516 --> 00:45:04,004
What about the money
from Sagamir Road?

895
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,884
.
What do you think?
I put it into
the new properties

896
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:09,284
What did you think,
it was just gonna
shoot up in perpetuity?

897

Don't patronize your mother,

898
00:45:11,684 --> 00:45:13,604

Of course I know
the risks involved

Hey, you're buying diamonds.
You got the bonus, right?

Don't change the subject.
I'm not changing the subject.

904
00:45:24,644 --> 00:45:26,085
I never saved any lives.

905
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:28,005
Yeah, but you did something,
and that's the point, Mom.

906
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:31,845
I make more in a month now
than I did
in my best year as a nurse.

00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:34,244
You made a difference.

908
00:45:34,244 --> 00:45:37,124
Listen to the broker
preaching
making a difference.

909
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:38,565
That's ironic.

from happening again.

you can see him today.

you were on the island

Yeah, but I'm in the middle
of Friday afternoon traffic.

But he said
after hours is okay,

928
00:46:27,158 --> 00:46:29,078
because he left
his home address.

really matter to you.

No, it doesn't.

I checked you out
with the desks in town

You didn't
make any money off it.

No, I didn't.

984
00:49:55,002 --> 00:49:56,730
Then why?

00:49:58,171 --> 00:50:00,091
Because you
destroyed my firm.

00:50:00,091 --> 00:50:01,051
Your firm
destroyed itself.

00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:02,330
You killed Louis Zabel.

Louis Zabel killed himself

00:50:08,203 --> 00:50:09,450
You made them true.

00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:11,371
No, Mr. Moore.

993
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:15,211
Putting 50% leverage
on toxic debt
made them true.

994
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:18,091
Look, Zabel once knew
how to run money.

995
00:50:18,091 --> 00:50:20,011
Dying because of it was his choice.

996
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:22,411
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just money.

But when you don't know
what you're doing,

998
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,731
it's fatal, Mr. Moore.

what you're doing.

Because your loyalty
demanded revenge.

Your balls actually
attempted it, and
your skill pulled it off.

1010

And frankly,

00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:09,965
Fair enough?

1013
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:15,725
You got my attention,
Mr. Moore.
That's pretty rare.

1014
00:51:16,204 --> 00:51:19,565
If I were you, I'd think seriously
about it.

1015
00:51:19,565 --> 00:51:21,964
Because you'll have
a hard time elsewhere,

1016
00:51:21,964 --> 00:51:24,844
.
now that you've
captured our attention

1017
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:29,245
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm having
a little fundraiser.

1018
00:51:29,245 --> 00:51:32,125
I got to get back to
shaking my tin cup.

1019
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:34,045
What's your number?

1020
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:35,613
I'm sorry?

1021
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:38,493
We'd start you at 300,
like everybody else.

1022
00:51:38,493 --> 00:51:40,893
I mean, as a partner,
I only pull in 600.
And the bonuses...

1023
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:42,413
No, no, no.

1024
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:44,334
Your number.

1025
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,773
The amount of money
you would need

1026
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:48,174
to just walk away from it
and live.

1027
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:49,134
See, I find that
everybody has a number,

1028
00:51:49,613 --> 00:51:50,573
and it's usually
an exact number.

1029
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:52,366
So what is yours?

1030
00:51:56,685 --> 00:51:58,126
More.

1031
00:52:15,726 --> 00:52:18,126
How did you know
it was Bretton James?

1032
00:52:18,126 --> 00:52:20,526
Good morning to you, too.
Come in.

1033
00:52:20,526 --> 00:52:21,966
Good morning.
You hungry?

1034
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:23,406
No. I'm okay, thanks.

1035
00:52:27,006 --> 00:52:28,926
GORDON: Brett,
as I called him
in the old days,

1036
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:29,886
used to run trades
through me.

1037
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:33,087
.
We used to piggyback
off each other's ideas

1038
00:52:33,566 --> 00:52:35,007
Then we had
a little discrepancy.

1039
00:52:35,007 --> 00:52:37,406
I won't bother you
with the details.

1040
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:40,767
Just to tell you that
it cost me 200,000 bucks,

1041
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:42,687
which was
a lot of money
back then.

1042
00:52:43,166 --> 00:52:44,126
So when I got hot
in the '80s,

1043
00:52:44,607 --> 00:52:47,006
and I started giving
tastes to my friends,

1044
00:52:47,006 --> 00:52:50,847
I didn't invite James in,
and he didn't
like that very much.

1045
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:52,767
So?

1046
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:56,127
GORDON: So
it's no big deal.

1047
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:59,967
But when you're in prison,
you got a lot
of time to think.

1048
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:06,687
In fact,
the best memory
that I know is hurt.

1049
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,567
I did eight years, pal.
Five years before that
in court.

1050
00:53:10,047 --> 00:53:14,735
Nobody does eight years.
They give murderers five.

1051
00:53:14,735 --> 00:53:17,615
I thought it was
the kid with the airline
that gave you up.

1052
00:53:18,095 --> 00:53:20,015
Blue Star?
Stock Watch?
What was it?

1053
00:53:20,015 --> 00:53:21,455
Who, Bud Fox?
Bud Fox.

1054
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:23,375
No, no, no.
He got a wire on him.

1055
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,816
He got me for
insider trading.

1056
00:53:24,816 --> 00:53:27,215
But that's
12, 13 months, max.

1057
00:53:27,696 --> 00:53:28,656
After the first charges,

1058
00:53:29,135 --> 00:53:32,015
it was
one of my co-conspirators
who tipped off the Feds.

1059
00:53:33,935 --> 00:53:36,336
And that pious piranha,
Bretton James,

1060
00:53:36,815 --> 00:53:39,695
he had just enough
information to sink me.

1061
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:42,208
You know, of course,
I'm never going to
know it for sure.

1062
00:53:43,168 --> 00:53:44,608
He offered me a job.

1063
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:52,836
Well, you just rocketed
into the center of
the universe, pal.

1064
00:53:52,836 --> 00:53:56,836
I think my daughter's future
is looking
a hell of a lot better.

1065
00:53:56,836 --> 00:53:59,764
I never made any money
shorting Hydra.

1066
00:53:59,764 --> 00:54:01,476
You're kidding me.
You didn't trade it?

1067
00:54:01,476 --> 00:54:04,356
That would've
been insider trading,
Mr. Gekko.

1068
00:54:04,836 --> 00:54:05,796
Remember,
your daughter and 
I are engaged.

1069
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,716
You wouldn't want to
soil her name, right?

1070
00:54:08,196 --> 00:54:09,636
Well,
you may not have traded,

1071
00:54:09,636 --> 00:54:12,964
but you try telling the Feds
you didn't commit a felony.

1072
00:54:12,964 --> 00:54:13,924
What do you mean?

1073
00:54:13,924 --> 00:54:15,845
You know exactly
what I mean.

1074
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:20,037
You induced others
to trade on information
that you knew to be false.

1075
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:27,684
.
Hard to prove that

1076
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:34,037
A fisherman always sees
another fisherman from afar.

1077
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:40,597
I think you ought to
start calling me Gordon.

1078
00:54:40,597 --> 00:54:43,125
Well, I promised
you this,

1079
00:54:43,605 --> 00:54:45,045
Gordon.

1080
00:54:45,045 --> 00:54:46,245
Makes us even.

1081
00:54:47,205 --> 00:54:48,165
There she is.

1082
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:50,085
.
But keep this
between us, though

1083
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:51,525
(EXHALES)

1084
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:53,445
How is that lefty
website of hers doing?

1085
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:55,237
Frozen Truth?
Yeah.

1086
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:58,117
It's doing well, actually.
They get about
50,000 hits a day.

1087
00:54:58,117 --> 00:54:59,558
It's building.
Mmm.

1088
00:55:00,037 --> 00:55:00,997
(LAUGHS)

1089
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,605
She was such a pisser.

1090
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:06,997
Relationships,
they're like bubbles.

1091
00:55:06,997 --> 00:55:10,358
They're fragile.
It's like these tulips.

1092
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:13,238
This is
the greatest bubble story
of all time.

1093
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:16,485
Back in the 1600s, the Dutch,
they get speculation fever

1094
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:18,405
to the point
that you could buy

1095
00:55:18,405 --> 00:55:20,806
a beautiful house
on a canal in Amsterdam,

1096
00:55:20,806 --> 00:55:23,686
for the price of one bulb.

1097
00:55:24,646 --> 00:55:27,045
They called it
"Tulip Mania."

1098
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:28,486
Then it collapsed.

1099
00:55:28,486 --> 00:55:29,925
You could buy
10 bulbs for $2.

1100
00:55:30,406 --> 00:55:33,766
People got wiped out,
but, you know,
who remembers?

1101
00:55:34,246 --> 00:55:35,846
What would you do
with your money?

1102
00:55:36,246 --> 00:55:38,406
Me? Switzerland.
Still the best.

1103
00:55:38,406 --> 00:55:41,287
Got a healthy distrust
for a big government.

1104
00:55:41,766 --> 00:55:43,686
Is that where
you keep it?

1105
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:47,478
Yes, I did. Now I don't got
that kind of cash anymore.

1106
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,079
But you do have money.

1107
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:54,919
This is a rental.

1108
00:55:56,839 --> 00:55:58,278
I'm pretty sure
James has invested

1109
00:55:58,278 --> 00:56:00,519
in an offshore fun
d in the Caymans.

1110
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:02,439
Your time,
you ever do anything

1111
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,007
?
with some company
called Locust Fund

1112
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,847
Locust Fund.
I never heard of it,
but it's possible. Yeah.

1113
00:56:07,847 --> 00:56:10,087
James wants to build
his alternative energy
sector.

1114
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:11,527
.
Sounds serious

1115
00:56:11,527 --> 00:56:12,967
I think I can get him
to put real capital

1116
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:14,327
behind this company I told you about.

1117
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,247
United Fusion.

1118
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:19,447
James would
probably want to polish
his resume a little green.

1119
00:56:19,447 --> 00:56:20,887
He's in pole position
to be top dog

1120
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:22,807
when Julie Steinhardt
kicks the bucket,

1121
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:24,567
which, I hear,
could be any day now.

1122
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:27,799
This company could change
not just the energy market
, Gordon, but the world.

1123
00:56:27,799 --> 00:56:30,679
Idealism. Idealism,
pal, it kills every deal.

1124
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,080
The thing you got to
know about James is,
he's a gambler.

1125
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,519
You know, like me.

1126
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:38,359
He's got an ego
the size of Antarctica.
(LAUGHS) Like me.

1127
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:40,760
So now you got his attention.

1128
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,487
How are you going to shine
sitting on his sun?

1129
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:48,968
Make him money
and melt his ass.

1130
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:53,128
Just like the old days.
We slaughtered men
for payback.

1131
00:56:55,528 --> 00:56:58,488
Maybe it's time for us
to do our second trade?

1132
00:57:00,408 --> 00:57:03,000
All right.
I'll dig around on James
and this Locust Fund,

1133
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,440
and you see what
you can do about

1134
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,360
getting Winnie and me
back together again.

1135
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,720
Well, I never guaranteed
she'd forgive you, Gordon.

1136
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,560
Why don't we just start
with her agreeing to have
dinner with you first, huh?

1137
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,129
Well, at my age,
I'll take anything
I can get.

1138
00:57:19,528 --> 00:57:21,929
.
I had two
beautiful children

1139
00:57:23,368 --> 00:57:26,841
.
And then I went away,
and I didn't see them much

1140
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:29,721
My ex made sure of that.

1141
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:33,561
,
And then when we lost Rudy

1142
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:39,049
Winnie just
shut down on me.

1143
00:57:46,521 --> 00:57:47,481
(SIGHS)

1144
00:57:48,922 --> 00:57:52,009
Except for
the exceedingly precious

1145
00:57:52,009 --> 00:57:54,409
and depreciating
asset of time.

1146
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:57,129
Winnie's all I got left.
You understand that?

1147
00:57:57,129 --> 00:57:59,849
I'll try, Gordon.

1148
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:04,249
Well, try harder.
Then you both
can have a father.

Yeah.

1151
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:20,922
Yeah, we used to come here
every Sunday night.

1152
00:58:20,922 --> 00:58:22,362
You're going to be fine.

1153
00:58:22,842 --> 00:58:24,762
You do know I'm never
having sex with you again.

1154
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:29,082
(LAUGHS) Then what
my friends say about marriage
is actually true. Five back.

1155
00:58:29,562 --> 00:58:30,522
I'm only doing this
for you.

1156
00:58:30,522 --> 00:58:32,762
No, baby. You're doing
this for you. Come on.

00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,730
Hi.

1160
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:52,650
Hey.

00:58:57,483 --> 00:58:58,283
Yeah.

No.

? Heineken?

00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:16,603
Yeah, sure.

Let me guess.
The ginger-garlic lobster.

1170
00:59:31,244 --> 00:59:33,484
I used to order that
every time.

1171
00:59:33,964 --> 00:59:35,404
I guess so.

1172
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:41,964

1178
00:59:53,325 --> 00:59:54,764
I don't think
that's the truth.

1179
00:59:54,764 --> 00:59:56,012
I agree with you.

1180
00:59:56,012 --> 00:59:56,972
You do?

1181
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:57,932
Yeah.
Jack Salmon wrote it...

1182
00:59:58,412 --> 00:59:59,085
Graydy.

1183
00:59:59,085 --> 01:00:01,484
Congratulations.
Great to see you.

1184
01:00:01,484 --> 01:00:02,925
You're doing
great work down there.

1185
01:00:02,925 --> 01:00:05,805
Um. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Gordon. Gordon Gekko.

1186
01:00:05,805 --> 01:00:07,245
Nice to see you.
Thanks so much.

1187
01:00:27,805 --> 01:00:29,565
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1188
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:43,294
Winnie!

1189
01:00:45,214 --> 01:00:46,653
Why did you make m
e do that, Jake?

1190
01:00:46,653 --> 01:00:48,094
You don't understand.
This is
none of your business.

1191
01:00:48,573 --> 01:00:49,533
It is my business.
Stop for a second.

1192
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:50,974
Look at
the real man in there.

1193
01:00:51,454 --> 01:00:52,894
He's hurting.
He's desperate to get
you back in his life.

1194
01:00:52,894 --> 01:00:54,814
He's not who you
think he is, Jake!

1195
01:00:54,814 --> 01:00:57,214
People change.
It was a long time ago
. Winnie.

1196
01:01:01,054 --> 01:01:02,974
He'll hurt us.

1197
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:06,334
Don't go back in there.

1198
01:01:14,574 --> 01:01:16,734
JAKE: Are we really going to lead with
this Babaco Solar?

1199
01:01:16,734 --> 01:01:19,615
It's a hustle, Bretton.
I passed on it twice
within the last two years.

1200
01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:21,054
They spin a sexy story

1201
01:01:21,054 --> 01:01:22,974
with these super-thin
cadmium
telluride semiconductors,

1202
01:01:23,455 --> 01:01:24,894
but the truth is,
the technology is
not proprietary...

1203
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:27,295
We've been over this,
Bretton. You are
unbelievable, Moore.

1204
01:01:27,295 --> 01:01:29,215
.
Babaco is a cow.
It's dead in the water

1205
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,846
.
The Chinese aren't
stupid. They're no
t going to go for it

1206
01:01:30,846 --> 01:01:32,287
Yeah, a cash cow maybe.

1207
01:01:32,766 --> 01:01:33,726
They've been saying
fusion is five years away
for the last 40 years.

1208
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:35,215
It is.
Laser fusion is
the future.

1209
01:01:35,215 --> 01:01:36,175
Can you prove that,
boy genius?

1210
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:37,614
Can you prove evolution,
girl genius?

1211
01:01:37,614 --> 01:01:38,574
That seems to work
, though, right?

1212
01:01:39,055 --> 01:01:40,494
Look, knock it off.
Both of you.

1213
01:01:40,494 --> 01:01:42,414
These guys are
parking 15 billion
across the board

1214
01:01:42,414 --> 01:01:43,374
in energy sectors

1215
01:01:43,374 --> 01:01:45,294
and I want them here, okay?

1216
01:01:45,775 --> 01:01:46,735
Carol's taking
the lead on this.

1217
01:01:46,735 --> 01:01:49,615
Our recommend is Babaco.
That's final.

1218
01:01:53,455 --> 01:01:54,895
Go ahead.
I'll take you to dinner some other time.

1219
01:01:54,895 --> 01:01:57,087
Oh, eat me, Moore.

1220
01:01:57,087 --> 01:01:59,567
CAROL: Babaco is at the 
forefront of developing thin film technology

1221
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:03,007
to incorporate solar cells
into pliable plastic sheets.

1222
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:06,287
We believe that within
the next few years
we can approach the 20% level

1223
01:02:06,287 --> 01:02:09,648
making it a perfect match
for the explosion of
growth and energy needs,

1224
01:02:10,096 --> 01:02:12,127
which, as you know,
is growing at 40%.

1225
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:15,775
Thin film technology
is the breakthrough here.

1226
01:02:16,256 --> 01:02:18,368
And in 2010,

1227
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:22,016
thin film is going to
surpass crystalline silicon.

1228
01:02:22,016 --> 01:02:23,376
And that's about it.

1229
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:27,456
Go ahead.

1230
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:28,495
So, with the world
energy demand

1231
01:02:28,976 --> 01:02:31,375
growing 40%
in the next 20 years,

1232
01:02:31,375 --> 01:02:33,536
we at Church believe,
Mr. Xu,

1233
01:02:33,536 --> 01:02:36,896
that Babaco Solar
is a cutting-edge
no-brainer.

1234
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:39,776
Good for a 20% return
in the next two years

1235
01:02:39,776 --> 01:02:42,656
with a 30 to 40% upside
in the next five years.

1236
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:45,057
Thank you, Miss Carol.

1237
01:02:45,536 --> 01:02:50,336
Solar will make
an important part
of our portfolio.

1238
01:02:50,336 --> 01:02:55,409
But truthfully, we have
seen similar technology
from another firm.

1239
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:58,368
As you know,
China's demand

1240
01:02:58,368 --> 01:03:02,208
will more than double
before my daughter turns 21.

1241
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:06,529
.
So we are looking
for the next 100 years

1242
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:10,129
Where even my grandson
can spend money.

1243
01:03:10,129 --> 01:03:12,529
CHUNG: Do you have
anything else to
present to us today?

1244
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:14,497
We've come a long way.

1245
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:19,137
Listen, Wang,

1246
01:03:19,137 --> 01:03:23,697
now, we got a great new line
on this shale oil technology.

1247
01:03:23,697 --> 01:03:26,977
Let's just dig
a lot deeper for a price
that we think is a good one.

1248
01:03:26,977 --> 01:03:29,857
We'll have
a complete workup for you
by the end of the month.

1249
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:32,737
All right, Bretton.
That sounds promising.

1250
01:03:32,737 --> 01:03:34,930
JAKE: What about fusion?

1251
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:36,290
We happen to be working
with a company right now.

1252
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,210
It's got all
the hardware in place.

1253
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:39,809
Started by
the Department of Energy.

1254
01:03:39,809 --> 01:03:42,529
They share
R&D facilities with
the University of California.

1255
01:03:42,529 --> 01:03:44,449
It's got
a market cap right now
of about a billion.

1256
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:45,890
No earnings.

1257
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:48,689
Fusion has been around
a long time.

1258
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,658
(SPEAKING MANDARIN
)

1259
01:03:54,018 --> 01:03:55,458
JAKE: The simple of it is,

1260
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,378
it's using the intense energy
of some 200 laser beams

1261
01:03:57,378 --> 01:04:00,098
focused on a single target
the size of
a few grains of rice

1262
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:01,538
filled with hydrogen fuel.

1263
01:04:02,019 --> 01:04:04,130
So the idea being that
when that target combusts

1264
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:07,058
it produces more energy than it took in.

1265
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:08,579
All the tests
they've done indicate

1266
01:04:09,058 --> 01:04:10,499
that they can use
this ignition process

1267
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:13,970
to turn simple seawater into energy.

1268
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:16,259
It's called
Ocean Thermal
Energy Conversion

1269
01:04:16,259 --> 01:04:18,450
using the reaction
between hot water
on the surface

1270
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:21,011
and cold water beneath
to power the lasers.

1271
01:04:21,011 --> 01:04:23,650
So what you wind up with
is unlimited clean energy.

1272
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,338
How do you contain
the explosion?

1273
01:04:26,338 --> 01:04:27,779
That's a secret
I can't really share
with you right now.

1274
01:04:28,259 --> 01:04:30,851
Not to be secretive,
but I could probably get
you in there for a peek.

1275
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:33,699
?
Maybe next week,
on your way back
to Beijing from DC

01:07:52,343 --> 01:07:53,784
We can talk about this
all night.

1342
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:55,704
That's great, Robby.
I'll see you later then,
all right?

I haven't seen you
in years.

This is
Erin and Christina.

1348

Hi.
Hello. Hi.

1349
01:08:10,344 --> 01:08:13,704
What was that airline called?
Blue Star, that's right.

1350
01:08:13,704 --> 01:08:16,056
That must be keeping you
pretty busy now, huh?

1351
01:08:17,496 --> 01:08:18,456
Excuse me.

1352
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:23,736
Well,
after a little time away,
I actually turned it into

1353
01:08:24,216 --> 01:08:27,385
one of the largest
private jet brokerages
in the world and sold it.

1354
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:28,697
Made millions.

1355
01:08:28,697 --> 01:08:31,417
That's great, pal.
That's really great.
So what's up next?

Ah!
And how about you, Gordon?

1359
01:08:41,657 --> 01:08:45,225
Does Blue Horseshoe
still love Anacott Steel?

You know it.

1361
01:08:49,497 --> 01:08:51,177
Well, I'll see you around
sometime, Gordon.

1362
01:08:52,617 --> 01:08:54,057

I like that.

What we really need
is some game-changing news

1369
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:58,027
And now you can come out of 
nowhere with one big story

1370
01:09:58,506 --> 01:10:00,426
Since "Mission Accomplished"
broke the Senator's affair,

200,000 hits a day

?
Is it expensive to run

1373
01:10:04,587 --> 01:10:07,147
Not really.
It's a shoestring budget.

1374
01:10:07,147 --> 01:10:09,467
Maybe Jake can find ways
to raise you some money

1375
01:10:09,467 --> 01:10:11,387
flip it to the public?

We don't really want
to go public.

1377

our credibility.

We want to stay non-profit

Non-profit? What is that?
I don't know what that is.

1380
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:19,627
I've heard the term before,
"non-profit."

1381

That's very funny.

1382
01:10:20,779 --> 01:10:23,259
You know what it is?
Isn't that when you
came out of school

1383
01:10:23,259 --> 01:10:24,219
and you had to
do something
for the government,

1384
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:25,659

You make modesty
a virtue, Bretton.

The truth is, nobody needs
inside information
anymore to get rich.

something like that?

1458

Last time you
came down to see me?

1460

We were going to
take a little trip.

that came out
after you went away,

things you were
recorded saying,
the affairs?

1466

. I put him in
the 12-step deal.

1476
01:15:09,586 --> 01:15:12,466
.
I never told you,
I borrowed money
from hardcore guys

1477
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:15,554

which I didn't have.

1478
01:15:16,034 --> 01:15:18,754

been there, Dad...

And you gotta stop
blaming yourself.

You're all
I got left, honey.

but I can make things better.

till the day that I die,

01:16:30,036 --> 01:16:31,476
you're my gal.

1498

Let me tell you
something, Bretton

1679
01:28:13,124 --> 01:28:15,044
You are not my mentor.
Lou Zabel was.

admit it or not,

1681

and forced him to suicide.

And he was betting
against the market
that he was making

1716

But the kicker is,
so was his firm.

1717

Churchill Schwartz
was shorting sub-primes?

Yeah, for the last two years
they've been hedging.

this home loan fantasy

collapse the market.

1722

01:35:35,023 --> 01:35:37,903
.
And I believe in this.
And you know that I do

1836
01:35:37,903 --> 01:35:40,303
What do you wanna do,
just report the news
for the rest of your life

1837
01:35:40,303 --> 01:35:42,015
or do you want
to make the news?
This is your opportunity.

1838
01:35:42,015 --> 01:35:43,935
It's your chance to shine.

1839
01:35:43,935 --> 01:35:45,855
To be Captain America.

1840
01:35:48,895 --> 01:35:50,336
(VOCALIZING)

1841
01:35:50,336 --> 01:35:54,176
This is the most charitable 
you could ever be in your life!

1842
01:35:56,575 --> 01:35:58,016
(VOCALIZING)
(LAUGHING)

1843
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:02,783
You honestly believe in this?

1844
01:36:04,095 --> 01:36:05,536
Let's say I could...

1845
01:36:05,536 --> 01:36:07,456
Let's say I could get
the money now,
hypothetically, right?

1846
01:36:07,456 --> 01:36:08,896
Not that you care
about the money.

1847
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:09,856
But let's say I
could take out a loan
against it,

1848
01:36:09,856 --> 01:36:12,736
minimize your risk
as much as possible.

1849
01:36:13,696 --> 01:36:15,616
Would you
do this for me, Winn?

1850
01:36:17,936 --> 01:36:19,856
Would you do this for me?

1851
01:36:45,376 --> 01:36:46,305
MALE BANKER:
Very well, Miss Gekko.

1852
01:36:46,305 --> 01:36:47,744
We will have
your father co-sign

1853
01:36:47,744 --> 01:36:50,065
and we will see to it
that the funds
are transferred.

1854
01:36:50,065 --> 01:36:52,257
Thank you.
Danke schon,Miss Gekko.

1855
01:36:52,257 --> 01:36:53,217
Mr. Moore.
Yes?

1856
01:36:53,697 --> 01:36:55,617
Mr. Gekko asked
that you call him
in New York

1857
01:36:55,617 --> 01:36:57,057
as soon as
this meeting is over.

1858
01:36:57,057 --> 01:36:58,497
Thank you.

1859
01:37:00,065 --> 01:37:01,986
So I'll take care
of the rest of this.
You go back to the hotel.

1860
01:37:01,986 --> 01:37:03,425
All right.
I just got
the confirmation.

1861
01:37:03,425 --> 01:37:04,866
We're on the direct
flight to New York
in the morning.

1862
01:37:04,866 --> 01:37:06,786
Great.

1863
01:37:06,786 --> 01:37:08,337
Great news on the loft.
Oh, yeah?

1864
01:37:08,337 --> 01:37:11,217
Yeah, I got a buyer.
So one less thing
in our lives, right?

1865
01:37:11,217 --> 01:37:12,657
I kind of
like the feeling.

1866
01:37:12,657 --> 01:37:13,617
Yeah, so do I.

1867
01:37:13,617 --> 01:37:14,577
I'll see you over there.

1868
01:37:15,058 --> 01:37:16,018
Okay.

1869
01:37:24,498 --> 01:37:25,745
Hey, anyone can
figure out life

1870
01:37:26,226 --> 01:37:27,665
when you're
looking back on it.

1871
01:37:27,665 --> 01:37:31,826
But we got to live it
going forward.
Right, Jakie?

1872
01:37:31,826 --> 01:37:35,218
Besides,
four-and-a-half is great
in this market.

1873
01:37:35,218 --> 01:37:36,658
Yeah, except I
owe six to the bank.

1874
01:37:36,658 --> 01:37:38,098
When do I have to
be out of here?

1875
01:37:38,098 --> 01:37:40,306
You got three months more.

1876
01:37:40,306 --> 01:37:44,179
By the way, I had to
throw in the furniture.

1877
01:37:44,179 --> 01:37:47,538
What there was of it.

1878
01:37:47,538 --> 01:37:49,458
Did you want me
to have a yard sale
here for you?

1879
01:37:49,458 --> 01:37:50,418
(DOORBELL RINGING)

1880
01:37:50,418 --> 01:37:52,338
Here. Take it.
Here's your pen.

1881
01:38:00,627 --> 01:38:01,587
Jake...

1882
01:38:02,067 --> 01:38:03,027
Dolores was just leaving.

1883
01:38:03,987 --> 01:38:05,106
Oh.

1884
01:38:08,946 --> 01:38:13,267
Hello to you, too, honey.
Don't forget.
Three months, honey.

1885
01:38:13,267 --> 01:38:14,227
Mmm-hmm.

1886
01:38:18,547 --> 01:38:20,467
.
Bastards changed the locks

1887
01:38:20,467 --> 01:38:21,427
You weren't
servicing the loans, Ma.

1888
01:38:21,907 --> 01:38:22,867
Well, they lied to me.

1889
01:38:22,867 --> 01:38:24,627
They told me
they were going to
give me more time.

1890
01:38:24,627 --> 01:38:26,547
Well, they're not, okay?
They're panicking.
Everyone is panicking.

1891
01:38:27,028 --> 01:38:27,988
They're gonna
throw it in the market

1892
01:38:28,307 --> 01:38:29,219
and take what they
can get for it, Ma.

1893
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:31,620
But it's
not even finished yet.

1894
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:34,019
And that's not all. Look.

1895
01:38:34,019 --> 01:38:35,939
It's the other
properties, Mom.

1896
01:38:35,939 --> 01:38:38,340
No, but they said
they were gonna give m
e a little more time.

1897
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:39,779
,
And all I need
is a 110 grand

1898
01:38:39,779 --> 01:38:43,140
and then that way,
I can keep all three
properties in play.

1899
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,579
I know you have it, Jake.
I don't have it, Mom.

1900
01:38:44,579 --> 01:38:45,939
You have it, Jacob
.
I don't have it,

1901
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,580
and I wouldn't
give it to you
if I did have it.

1902
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:49,540
?
What am I
supposed to do

1903
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:50,980
You know what
moral hazard is, Ma?

1904
01:38:50,980 --> 01:38:52,420
You know what
that means?
No.

1905
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:53,588
It means that once
you get bailed out,
what's to stop you

1906
01:38:53,588 --> 01:38:55,028
from taking another shot?

1907
01:38:55,028 --> 01:38:55,988
But I...

1908
01:38:55,988 --> 01:38:57,908
I'm in trouble, Mom.
I am in trouble right now.

1909
01:38:57,908 --> 01:38:59,348
I'm taking a huge hit
on the loft,

1910
01:38:59,348 --> 01:39:00,788
I just sold my bike for nothing

1911
01:39:00,788 --> 01:39:02,148
and now, again, I'm
writing you a check, Mom.
Oh.

1912
01:39:02,628 --> 01:39:03,588
It's ridiculous.

1913
01:39:04,948 --> 01:39:07,301
.
This is $30,000
that I barely have

1914
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:09,221
,
But that's
not enough, honey.
Ma, I love you

1915
01:39:09,221 --> 01:39:11,668
but I cannot keep
hemorrhaging money
for your insanity.

1916
01:39:11,668 --> 01:39:13,109
What you need to d
o is you need to
go back to Henry.

1917
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:14,548
You need to get
another job, okay?

1918
01:39:15,029 --> 01:39:17,861
But this is my job.
I have a job.
What do you... Oh, my God.

1919
01:39:17,861 --> 01:39:19,300
You mean like
a real job with a boss?

1920
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:20,260
Yes, a real job.

1921
01:39:20,741 --> 01:39:22,181
I'm too old to get a...
I'm sorry, Ma,

1922
01:39:22,181 --> 01:39:23,621
you got to
start at some point.

1923
01:39:23,621 --> 01:39:25,061
You got to start now.
I can't keep
carrying you forever.

(THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY
RINGTONE PLAYING)

1925

You're not the only one
who's in trouble, Ma. Please.

1926
01:39:29,381 --> 01:39:30,821
Hello?

1927
01:39:30,821 --> 01:39:32,741
DR. MASTERS:
Hey, Jake.
We have a problem.

1928
01:39:34,181 --> 01:39:35,700
Go ahead.

1929
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,901
I don't know what happened
. My CFO says the money
hasn't arrived yet.

1930
01:39:40,821 --> 01:39:42,741
Yeah, but it was
sent yesterday.

1931
01:39:42,741 --> 01:39:45,781
It should have been there
before the Fedwire
closed at 6:00.

1932
01:39:46,261 --> 01:39:49,861
Well, maybe there's been
some sort of mistake.
It was a large amount.

1933
01:39:52,262 --> 01:39:53,861
Okay, just sit tight.

1934
01:39:53,861 --> 01:39:55,302
All right?

1935
01:39:55,302 --> 01:39:56,502
Jesus.

1936
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:05,269
A few days?
In this city that's nothing.

1937
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:09,109
Mr. Gekko is good tenant.

1938
01:40:09,109 --> 01:40:11,029
I appreciate it.

A fisherman always sees
another fisherman from afar.

Winnie's all I got left.
You understand that?

1941
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:47,431
JAKE: How much?

1942
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:49,751
Close to $100 million
by now.

1943
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:54,551
Don't go back in there, Jake.

1944
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:58,951
This is who he is.

1945
01:41:02,071 --> 01:41:03,511
I did tell you, Jake.

1946
01:41:04,951 --> 01:41:06,391
I did warn you.

1947
01:41:07,831 --> 01:41:09,751
I lied to you, Winnie.

1948
01:41:15,384 --> 01:41:18,743
I've been in contact
with your father
behind your back.

1949
01:41:23,031 --> 01:41:24,951
After we saw him
at the dinner,

1950
01:41:25,911 --> 01:41:27,831
before you
gave me the money.

1951
01:41:39,304 --> 01:41:40,744
Why?

1952
01:41:43,304 --> 01:41:47,144
Because I thought it was
the best thing for you,
you know. For us.

1953
01:41:56,665 --> 01:41:57,944
.
I just wanted to..

1954
01:42:04,953 --> 01:42:06,392
You're like him.

1955
01:42:08,793 --> 01:42:10,665
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Winnie.

1956
01:42:13,545 --> 01:42:16,313
I'll make it up to you
. I promise I'll
get the money back.

1957
01:42:16,313 --> 01:42:20,665
I don't care
about the money, Jake!
This is not about the money.

1958
01:42:20,665 --> 01:42:23,305
This is about you and me,
and we are not good anymore.

1959
01:42:25,945 --> 01:42:28,153
Winn, we are good.
Come on.

1960
01:42:29,593 --> 01:42:31,113
We are good.

1961
01:42:31,593 --> 01:42:33,033
Come on, Winn.
We're good.

1962
01:42:33,033 --> 01:42:33,993
No.

1963
01:42:36,393 --> 01:42:39,273
We're supposed to
make each other
feel safe.

01:42:41,193 --> 01:42:43,113
Otherwise,
what's the point?

1965
01:42:49,146 --> 01:42:50,585
It's gone, Jake.

1966
01:42:51,545 --> 01:42:53,465
It's not.
Please don't.

1967
01:42:53,465 --> 01:42:54,826
Take it.

1968
01:43:01,066 --> 01:43:02,474

01:43:03,673 --> 01:43:05,114
Please go.

Please.

1971
01:43:08,314 --> 01:43:09,274
Go.

1972
01:43:15,995 --> 01:43:17,354
I'm sorry.

GORDON: China, India, Brazil.
Silver, oil,
copper, I want to own it all.

1974
01:43:54,315 --> 01:43:56,715
Buy me Churchill Schwartz,

1975
01:43:56,715 --> 01:43:59,115
and get me updates
on the other financials.

1976
01:43:59,115 --> 01:44:01,995
I'm looking for deals.
Only good deals.

1977
01:44:01,995 --> 01:44:05,356
.
Just ride the trends.
Just don't try
too hard for the turns

1978
01:44:05,356 --> 01:44:07,276
It's just like
the old days, Bobby.

1979
01:44:07,276 --> 01:44:09,675
BOBBY: What do you feel
about California municipals,
Gordon?

1980
01:44:09,675 --> 01:44:12,076
No way.
California has
made more mistakes

1981
01:44:12,076 --> 01:44:14,475
than Yogi Berra
reciting Shakespeare.

Right now,
it is ugly times ugly.

1984

And that's when
the ugly get going.

1985
01:44:23,116 --> 01:44:26,476
You tell them for me, babe,
Gordon Gekko is back.

1986
01:44:29,148 --> 01:44:31,068
I'm looking for
distressed securities.

1987
01:44:31,068 --> 01:44:32,268
I'm trying to
get a hold of them

1988
01:44:32,588 --> 01:44:34,988
before the government does.
You got that?

1989
01:44:35,948 --> 01:44:37,388
Okay.

1990
01:44:37,388 --> 01:44:38,828
Here you are, Mr. Gekko.

1991
01:44:38,828 --> 01:44:40,268
Nice, Harry.

1992
01:44:40,268 --> 01:44:43,148
Well, then, Alex,
you tell
the Treasury Department for me

1993
01:44:43,628 --> 01:44:46,508
that I'm willing to stand
on the other side
of their auction.

1994
01:44:46,508 --> 01:44:48,909
Not too tight
under the arms,
Mr. Gekko?

(LAUGHS)
Jesus Christ.

1996
01:44:50,348 --> 01:44:52,108
I tell you,
the government's
worse than a wife.

1997
01:44:52,108 --> 01:44:55,277
They got all the power,
they got half the money.

1998
01:44:55,277 --> 01:44:57,597
Now they're working

You, Gordo.

You want to make
one last trade?

2013

.
Well, that depends

2014
01:45:47,678 --> 01:45:50,157
Did you ever really want
to reconcile with her?

2015
01:45:52,077 --> 01:45:53,358
I'm human.

2016
01:45:53,358 --> 01:45:54,798
Then why did you do it?

2017
01:45:54,798 --> 01:45:56,718
Well, it's
the same answer.

2018
01:45:56,718 --> 01:46:00,078
Look, I told you before,
Winnie was gonna
stake me when I got out.

You remember,
she reneged.

2020

Sure, she did.

act so superior, kid.

122 thousand hours of my life
for a victimless crime.

2026
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:20,319
I ate my bitterness
every goddamn day.

2027
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:21,871
And when I got out,
who was waiting for me?

2028
01:46:21,871 --> 01:46:22,831
Nobody!

2029
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:26,671
Not even my own daughter.

2030
01:46:26,671 --> 01:46:30,030
I thought Bretton was slime
until I met you.

2031
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:32,910
I just never believed
that a man would sell out
his own daughter.

2032
01:46:32,910 --> 01:46:35,791
You die your way,
I'll die mine.
Get the hell out of here.

2033

she left me, Gordon.

I'm sorry about that.

Yeah? I bet you are.

You left it all in ruins.

2038

But no matter
how much money you make,
you'll never be rich.

2039
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:56,431
See, that's what
you never got, kid.
It's not about the money.

2040
01:46:56,431 --> 01:46:59,791
It's about the game.
The game between people.

2041

2044
01:47:09,599 --> 01:47:13,312
You give back
the principal to Winnie.
The $100 million.

2045
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,840
And what do I
get in return?

2046
01:47:20,512 --> 01:47:21,952
Put this in.

That's your grandson.

You said,
"The most valuable commodity
I know is time."

2049

This is time, Gordon.

Jake, but this is simply
a trade I cannot make.

because people like you and me
want to be lied to.

the rumor is that he was

before he ended
up acquiring it.

2064

to Louis Zabel

you can't bust him for that.

01:56:30,653 --> 01:56:32,445
Always creating change.

2168
01:56:52,445 --> 01:56:53,886
Can I carry that?

2169
01:56:58,686 --> 01:57:01,086
You're not sleeping either?

2170
01:57:01,086 --> 01:57:03,006
He woke me up last night.

2171
01:57:06,846 --> 01:57:07,806
Yeah.

2172
01:57:08,286 --> 01:57:09,246
Can I?

2173
01:57:10,686 --> 01:57:11,646
Yeah.

2174
01:57:22,687 --> 01:57:23,647
There?

2175
01:57:24,126 --> 01:57:25,374
Yeah.

2176
01:57:32,446 --> 01:57:34,847
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Masters.

2177
01:57:34,847 --> 01:57:36,286
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

2178
01:57:37,246 --> 01:57:39,166
Very happy man.

2179
01:57:39,166 --> 01:57:41,567
Renewed interests
from investors.

2180
01:57:41,567 --> 01:57:43,006
Because of your story.

2181
01:57:43,966 --> 01:57:45,407
So, thank you.

2182
01:57:49,247 --> 01:57:51,167
I miss you, Winnie.

2183
01:57:52,607 --> 01:57:53,567
I miss you.

2184
01:57:56,447 --> 01:57:58,847
I don't know how to fix this.

2185
01:58:00,287 --> 01:58:01,727
Neither do I.

2186
01:58:04,127 --> 01:58:05,567
.
It's different now

2187
01:58:06,047 --> 01:58:07,007
What can I do?
I mean, I...

2188
01:58:07,007 --> 01:58:08,447
Nothing.

2189
01:58:10,368 --> 01:58:11,328
Nothing.

2190
01:58:20,976 --> 01:58:22,575
Thank you.

2191
01:58:23,056 --> 01:58:24,495
.
Good night.
Good night

2192
01:58:29,616 --> 01:58:31,536
GORDON:
Where are you two going?

2193
01:58:43,136 --> 01:58:46,496
What, nobody around here
believes in comebacks?

2194
01:58:51,776 --> 01:58:53,696
Winn, I owe you something.

2195
01:58:55,056 --> 01:58:57,936
I don't want it.
I never did.

2196
01:58:58,896 --> 01:59:00,816
No, I figured that.

2197
01:59:00,816 --> 01:59:04,449
But, you know,
when choosing
between two evils,

2198
01:59:04,449 --> 01:59:09,249
I like to try the one
that I haven't tried before.

2199
01:59:10,689 --> 01:59:14,529
So I deposited
a check of $100 million

2200
01:59:15,969 --> 01:59:18,177
made out to United Fusion.

2201
01:59:21,457 --> 01:59:24,497
.
From some offshore fund
no one needs to know about

2202
01:59:25,937 --> 01:59:29,057
Wouldn't you say green
is the new bubble, Jake?

2203
01:59:38,130 --> 01:59:40,337
.
You two make a nice couple

2204
01:59:47,809 --> 01:59:51,170
,
You know,
Winn, human beings

2205
01:59:53,569 --> 01:59:55,490
we got to give them a break.

2206
01:59:57,410 --> 01:59:59,330
We're all mixed bags.

2207
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:07,090
But

2208
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:10,450
my grandson,

2209
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:13,330
and you...

2210
02:00:15,731 --> 02:00:18,611
And maybe, you know,
you'll let me be
a father again.

2211
02:00:26,099 --> 02:00:27,539
(HOMEPLAYING)

2212
02:00:33,971 --> 02:00:39,939
  The dimming of the light 
makes the picture clearer

2213
02:00:39,939 --> 02:00:43,299
  It's just an old photograph

2214
02:00:43,299 --> 02:00:47,220
  There's nothing to hide

2215
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:52,980
  And we'll
mix our lives together

2216
02:00:55,171 --> 02:00:57,939
  Every hand

2217
02:00:57,939 --> 02:01:04,500
  Goes searching
for its partner

2218
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:08,820
  In crime

2219
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:11,812
  Connecting

2220
02:01:11,812 --> 02:01:15,652
  To every living soul

2221
02:01:18,532 --> 02:01:20,260
  I'm looking for a home

2222
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:25,380
  Where the wheels are turning

2223
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:30,660
  Home
Why I keep returning

2224
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:36,900
  Home
Will infect what ever you do

2225
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:46,981
  Home
With the neighbors fighting

2226
02:01:46,981 --> 02:01:52,260
  Home
Always so exciting

2227
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:59,253
  Home
Were my parents
telling the truth?

2228
02:01:59,732 --> 02:02:01,652
What's
the matter with you guys?
Come on, what's the matter
?

2229
02:02:01,652 --> 02:02:03,541
You guys are
like the last two
on a ship that is sinking.

2230
02:02:09,573 --> 02:02:10,773
That's pretty.

2231
02:02:10,773 --> 02:02:14,133
Isn't that
a Cracker Jack box ring?

2232
02:02:14,133 --> 02:02:19,174
  Home
With our bodies touching

2233
02:02:19,174 --> 02:02:24,934
  Home
And the cameras watching

2234
02:02:24,934 --> 02:02:30,934
  Home
Comes to life
from out of the blue  

2235
02:02:32,214 --> 02:02:34,534
(THIS MUST BE THE PLACE
PLAYING)

2236
02:03:08,135 --> 02:03:11,494
  Home
is where I want to be

2237
02:03:11,975 --> 02:03:15,815
  Pick me up and turn me round

2238
02:03:15,815 --> 02:03:20,135
  I feel numb
Born with a weak heart

2239
02:03:20,135 --> 02:03:23,975
  I guess I must be having fun

2240
02:03:24,455 --> 02:03:27,223
  The less we say about it
the better

2241
02:03:28,535 --> 02:03:30,663
  Make it up as we go along

2242
02:03:32,343 --> 02:03:35,943
  Feet on the ground
Head in the sky

2243
02:03:35,943 --> 02:03:39,303
  It's okay
I know nothing's wrong

2244
02:03:39,655 --> 02:03:41,063
  Nothing

2245
02:03:41,063 --> 02:03:45,383
  Hi, yo
I got plenty of time

2246
02:03:48,904 --> 02:03:53,704
  Hi, yo
You got light in your eyes

2247
02:03:55,624 --> 02:03:58,983
  And you're standing here
beside me

2248
02:04:00,984 --> 02:04:04,344
  I love the passing of time

2249
02:04:04,344 --> 02:04:08,375
  Never for money
Always for love

2250
02:04:08,375 --> 02:04:11,256
  Cover up and say good night

2251
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:13,736
  Say good night

2252
02:04:40,824 --> 02:04:44,185
  Home
is where I want to be

2253
02:04:44,185 --> 02:04:48,025
  But I guess
I'm already there

2254
02:04:48,025 --> 02:04:52,345
  I come home
She lifted up her wings

2255
02:04:52,345 --> 02:04:56,665
  Guess that
this must be the place

2256
02:04:56,665 --> 02:04:59,545
  I can't tell
one from another

2257
02:05:00,985 --> 02:05:03,385
  Did I find you
or you find me?

2258
02:05:04,825 --> 02:05:08,665
  There was a time
before we were born

2259
02:05:08,665 --> 02:05:11,545
  If someone asks
This is where I'll be

2260
02:05:12,026 --> 02:05:13,465
  Where I'll be

2261
02:05:13,465 --> 02:05:18,265
  Hi, yo
We drift in and out

2262
02:05:21,145 --> 02:05:25,866
  Hi, yo
Sing into my mouth

2263
02:05:28,265 --> 02:05:32,106
  Out of all
those kinds of people

2264
02:05:33,066 --> 02:05:35,466
w
  You got a face with a vie

2265
02:05:37,386 --> 02:05:40,746
  I'm just an animal
looking for a home

2266
02:05:40,746 --> 02:05:44,106
  Share the same space
for a minute or two

2267
02:05:44,106 --> 02:05:47,946
  And you love me
till my heart stops

2268
02:05:49,386 --> 02:05:51,787
  Love me till I'm dead

2269
02:05:53,226 --> 02:05:56,587
  Eyes that light up
Eyes look through you

2270
02:05:57,066 --> 02:05:58,986
  Cover up the blank spots

2271
02:05:58,986 --> 02:06:00,906
  Hit me on the head

2272
02:06:00,906 --> 02:06:02,347
  Ooh

2273
02:06:12,907 --> 02:06:16,267
e
  Home is where I want to b

2274
02:06:16,747 --> 02:06:20,507
  Pick me up and turn me round

2275
02:06:20,507 --> 02:06:24,347
  I feel numb
Born with a weak heart

2276
02:06:24,347 --> 02:06:27,707
  I guess I must be having fun

2277
02:06:29,147 --> 02:06:32,987
  The less we say about it

  Make it up as we go along

2279
02:06:37,308 --> 02:06:41,148
  Feet on the ground
Head in the sky

2280
02:06:41,148 --> 02:06:44,028
  It's okay
I know nothing's wrong

2281
02:06:44,028 --> 02:06:45,467
  Nothing

2282
02:06:45,948 --> 02:06:50,267
  Hi, yo

You got light in your eyes

  Never for money
Always for love

  Cover up and say good night

2288
02:07:16,188 --> 02:07:18,108
  Say good night
