00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:19.983
No matter what they say,
it's all about money.

2
00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:23.403
Imagine that you're
a savings and loan officer.

3
00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.823
Watch. One, two, three. See?

4
00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:29.451
You've got it all,
and we've got nothin'.

5
00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:32.037
-You have all four. Take a look.
-Ah!

6
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.083
I wouldn't trust you with real gold.
That's why this is only worth a penny.

7
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.086
If you wonder where
the other one went, watch.

8
00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:41.505
A penny from the ear.
How much for the rest?

9
00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:44.591
- Have you seen Edward?
- No. Great party, Philip.

10
00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:47.678
My wife went to a lot of trouble.
She called the caterer.

11
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:51.431
- Howard, how are you?
- Edward's taking over Morse Industries?

12
00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:53.934
- He's not here to get tan.
- Can I get in on it?

13
00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:55.519
- Yeah. Just call me.
- When?

14
00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:58.355
Hi. I'm Philip Stuckey,
Edward Lewis's lawyer.

15
00:00:58.438 --> 00:01:00.983
- Where's the guest of honour?
- I don't know.

16
00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:04.861
He's probably in a corner charming
a very pretty lady. How are you?

17
00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:08.407
I told my secretary to make the
arrangements. Didn't she call you?

18
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.369
Yes, she did. I speak to
your secretary more than I speak to you.

19
00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:15.289
- I see.
- I have my own life too, Edward.

20
00:01:15.372 --> 00:01:18.250
This is a very important week
for me. I need you here.

21
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:22.713
You never give me any notice.
You think I'm at your beck and call.

22
00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:25.757
I do not believe that you are
at my beck and call.

23
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:29.177
That's the way you make me feel.
Maybe I should move out.

24
00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:32.556
- If that's what you want.
- When you get back, we'll discuss it.

25
00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:36.184
- Now is as good a time as any.
- That's fine with me. Goodbye.

26
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.603
Goodbye, Jessica.

27
00:01:43.108 --> 00:01:45.986
- Phil suggested that I...
- Phil is just my lawyer, OK?

28
00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:48.697
How did the Morse stock open
on the Nikkei?

29
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.407
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

30
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.994
Tokyo opened 90 minutes ago.
You have to keep on top of it.

31
00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.954
- Hello, Mr Lewis.
- How you doing?

32
00:01:56.038 --> 00:01:59.082
I want this done as soon as possible.
I gotta get to New York.

33
00:01:59.207 --> 00:02:00.667
I got tickets to The Met.

34
00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:04.087
- Your coat, Mr Lewis.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.840
- Edward.
- Susan.

36
00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:08.592
Hi.

37
00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:11.595
- I was sorry to hear about Carter.
- Thanks.

38
00:02:11.678 --> 00:02:14.264
- I heard you got married.
- Well...

39
00:02:14.348 --> 00:02:17.684
- Yeah, I couldn't wait for you.
- Mm.

40
00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:20.020
- Tell me something.
- Yes.

41
00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:22.356
When you and I were dating,

42
00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.442
did you speak to my secretary
more than you spoke to me?

43
00:02:25.525 --> 00:02:28.111
She was
one of my bridesmaids.

44
00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:29.655
Oh.

45
00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:33.492
Your husband's
a lucky guy. Bye.

46
00:02:33.575 --> 00:02:35.243
Thanks. Bye.

47
00:02:35.327 --> 00:02:37.079
- Do you?
- Absolutely.

48
00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:39.956
He's leaving.
Edward's leaving.

49
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.542
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

50
00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.336
Is this Mr Stuckey's?

51
00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.464
Where are you going?

52
00:02:47.547 --> 00:02:50.967
- You got the keys to your car?
- What's wrong with the limo?

53
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:53.595
The limo is buried.
Darryl can't get it out.

54
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.723
- Please give me the keys.
- I don't think you should drive.

55
00:02:56.848 --> 00:02:59.309
You're excited.
Don't drive my car.

56
00:02:59.434 --> 00:03:02.979
What kind of a system is this?
Can you move these cars out of here?

57
00:03:03.063 --> 00:03:04.731
Look, Edward... Edward.

58
00:03:04.856 --> 00:03:07.150
Are you familiar
with a stick shift?

59
00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:09.069
- Yeah.
- Just be ginger with it.

60
00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:11.029
It's a new car.

61
00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:12.989
-I can do it.
- Edward!

62
00:03:13.073 --> 00:03:15.325
- Give me a break, please.
- I love this car.

63
00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.496
I love it too. You don't know where
you're going. You're gonna get lost.

- That's a sweet offer, but not now.

137

-Come downstairs.
-Work out what?

138

-What are we working out?
-You really like her?

I was sleeping?

140
00:08:42.736 --> 00:08:44.946

- Let's go.
- Snack. Snack.

142
00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:51.870
- Besides, it's my apartment.
- I have to live there too.

143
00:08:51.953 --> 00:08:55.081

144
00:08:55.206 --> 00:08:57.292
and some valuable
vocational advice.

00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:01.296

something, so don't irritate me.

Irritate you?
Irritate you?

148
00:09:05.717 --> 00:09:08.470
I just saw a girl
pulled out of a Dumpster.

149
00:09:08.553 --> 00:09:12.849
I know, Skinny Marie.
But she was a flake.

150
00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:16.394

Dominic tried to straighten her out.

Forgive me.
I was just taking a rest.

164
00:10:00.897 --> 00:10:03.650
- Besides, she's new.
- Yeah, well, I'm old.

165
00:10:03.733 --> 00:10:06.486
So go rest up by Monty Hall
or Esther Wilson.

166
00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:08.696
- Williams.
- Esther Williams.

167
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.283
Back off, Kit. You're really
becoming a grouch.

168
00:10:12.408 --> 00:10:15.745
- Am I really a grouch?
- Yes.

169
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:19.374
- Sometimes.
- Well, just 'cause I'm hungry.

170
00:10:19.457 --> 00:10:22.001
- I'm gonna get something to eat.
- Hey, girls!

171
00:10:22.085 --> 00:10:26.381
- Hey, yo, baby.
- How about a freebie? It's my birthday.

172
00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:27.841
Dream on.

173
00:10:30.468 --> 00:10:32.679
It's looking
really slow tonight.

174
00:10:32.762 --> 00:10:35.557
Yeah, well... Maybe we
should get a pimp, you know.

175
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.351
Carlos really digs you.

176
00:10:38.476 --> 00:10:41.604
And then he'll run our lives
and take our money. No.

177
00:10:41.688 --> 00:10:45.316
You're right. We say who,
we say when, we say how much.

178
00:10:47.443 --> 00:10:49.654
Do you think I look
like Carol Channing?

179
00:10:49.737 --> 00:10:52.490
I love this look.
It's very glamorous.

180
00:10:52.574 --> 00:10:54.617
Glamour choice.

181
00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:57.203
Oh, yo. Oh, yo.
Catch this.

182
00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:01.875
Wait a minute.
That's a Lotus Esprit.

183
00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.044
No, that's rent.

184
00:11:05.128 --> 00:11:07.046
You should go for him.
You look hot.

185
00:11:07.213 --> 00:11:10.884
Don't take less than 100. Call me
when you're through. Take care of you.

186
00:11:10.967 --> 00:11:12.510
Take care of you.

187
00:11:15.013 --> 00:11:19.184
Work it. Work it, baby. Work it.

188
00:11:19.267 --> 00:11:21.936
Work it. Own it.

189
00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:25.273
Yes, you can handle this.

190
00:11:25.398 --> 00:11:27.233
First is here somewhere.

191
00:11:28.443 --> 00:11:31.321
Hey, sugar,
you looking for a date?

192
00:11:31.404 --> 00:11:33.907
No, Beverly Hills.
Can you give me directions?

193
00:11:34.032 --> 00:11:36.618
Sure. For five bucks.

194
00:11:38.453 --> 00:11:41.623
- Ridiculous.
- Price just went up to ten.

195
00:11:41.706 --> 00:11:45.126
- You can't charge me for directions.
- I can do anything I want to.

196
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.920
I ain't lost.

197
00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:53.343
All right. OK.

198
00:11:53.426 --> 00:11:56.763
All right. You win. I lose.
Got change for a 207

199
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.015
For 20, I'll show you personal.

200
00:11:59.098 --> 00:12:02.810
- Show you where the stars live.
- I've already been to Stallone's.

201
00:12:02.894 --> 00:12:05.730
Right. Down the street.

202
00:12:07.232 --> 00:12:09.776
Lights. Lights would be good.

203
00:12:12.278 --> 00:12:13.613
This is a hot car.

204
00:12:13.738 --> 00:12:15.740
It's a little temperamental.

205
00:12:15.823 --> 00:12:17.909
-Yours?
-No, it isn't.

206
00:12:17.992 --> 00:12:19.869
- Stolen?
- Not exactly.

207
00:12:19.953 --> 00:12:21.454
What's your name?

208
00:12:22.956 --> 00:12:25.124
What do you want it to be?

209
00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:28.294
Vivian.

210
00:12:28.378 --> 00:12:30.797
- My name is Vivian.
- Vivian.

211
00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:33.758
So, what hotel you staying at?

212
00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:37.637
- The Regent Beverly Wilshire.
- Down the block, right at the corner.

213
00:12:43.977 --> 00:12:48.398
Man, this baby must corner
like it's on rails.

214
00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:49.899
Beg your pardon?

215
00:12:49.983 --> 00:12:53.319
Doesn't it blow your mind?
This is only four cylinders.

216
00:12:54.946 --> 00:12:58.241
- You know cars. Where's that from?
<i>- Road & Track</i>.

217
00:12:58.324 --> 00:13:02.412
Boys back home I grew up with
were really into Mustangs, Corvettes.

218
00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:05.206
They bought 'em, fixed them up.
I paid attention.

219
00:13:05.331 --> 00:13:08.167
So, how is it you know
so little about cars?

220
00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:10.503
My first car
was a limousine.

221
00:13:12.672 --> 00:13:15.091
So, where is this...

222
00:13:15.174 --> 00:13:17.385
...heavy metal home?

223
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.221
Milledgeville, Georgia.

224
00:13:20.305 --> 00:13:22.765
I think you left
your transmission back there.

225
00:13:22.849 --> 00:13:25.351
You're not shifting right.
This is a standard H.

226
00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:28.021
Standard H? Like I know
what that means.

227
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.399
You ever driven a Lotus?

228
00:13:31.941 --> 00:13:33.192
No.

229
00:13:33.276 --> 00:13:35.903
- You're gonna start right now.
- You're joking.

230
00:13:35.987 --> 00:13:39.032
No, it's the only way
I can get you off my coat.

231
00:13:43.077 --> 00:13:46.539
Fasten your seat belt. I'm taking you
for the ride of your life.

232
00:13:46.664 --> 00:13:48.499
I'll show you
what this car can do.

233
00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:51.502
Are you ready?
Hang on. Here we go.

234
00:13:57.842 --> 00:14:00.928
This has pedals like a race car.
They're close together.

235
00:14:01.012 --> 00:14:05.099
It's probably easier for a woman
to drive, 'cause they have little feet.

236
00:14:06.142 --> 00:14:08.436
Except me.
I wear a size 9.

237
00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:12.190
You know your foot's as big as your arm
from your elbow to your wrist?

238
00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:15.818
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

239
00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:17.945
It's a little bit of trivia.

240
00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:25.745
Tell me, what kind of money
do you girls make these days?

241
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.374
- Ballpark.
- Can't take less $100.

242
00:14:30.792 --> 00:14:33.878
- Hundred dollars a night?
- For an hour.

243
00:14:33.961 --> 00:14:35.963
An hour?

244
00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:37.465
You make $100 an hour,

245
00:14:37.548 --> 00:14:40.593
and you got a safety pin
holding your boot up?

246
00:14:40.676 --> 00:14:43.679
- You gotta be joking.
- I never joke about money.

247
00:14:43.763 --> 00:14:44.972
Neither do I.

248
00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:49.936
Hundred dollars an hour.
Pretty stiff.

249
00:14:53.314 --> 00:14:56.859
Well, no, but it's
got potential.

250
00:15:15.753 --> 00:15:17.380
Good evening, Mr Lewis.

251
00:15:17.797 --> 00:15:21.384
-Will you be needing the car tonight?
-I hope not.

252
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.640
Ah, we're here.

253
00:15:27.807 --> 00:15:29.308
Yeah.

254
00:15:33.938 --> 00:15:35.356
So, you'll be all right?

255
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.110
Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab
with my 20 bucks.

256
00:15:39.193 --> 00:15:41.446
Go back to your office.

257
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.991
Yeah.
My office. Yeah.

258
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.368
Well, thanks for the ride.

259
00:15:51.247 --> 00:15:53.583
- See you.
- Goodbye.

260
00:16:06.387 --> 00:16:08.222
No taxis?

261
00:16:09.932 --> 00:16:12.101
No, I like the bus.

262
00:16:15.646 --> 00:16:18.858
I was thinking, did you
really say $100 an hour?

263
00:16:18.941 --> 00:16:20.735
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

264
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.448
Well, if you don't have
any prior engagements,

265
00:16:25.531 --> 00:16:27.867
I'd be very pleased
if you'd accompany me

266
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.745
- into the hotel.
- You got it.

267
00:16:34.332 --> 00:16:37.543
- What is your name?
- Edward.

268
00:16:37.627 --> 00:16:39.962
That's my favourite name
in the whole world.

269
00:16:40.046 --> 00:16:41.297
No.

270
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.800
I tell you what, this is fate, Edward.
That's what this is.

271
00:16:47.011 --> 00:16:48.971
Why don't you put this on?

272
00:16:49.055 --> 00:16:51.807
- Why?
- Well...

273
00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:53.809
This hotel is not an establishment

274
00:16:53.893 --> 00:16:56.312
that rents rooms by the hour.

275
00:16:56.395 --> 00:16:57.688
Ah.

276
00:17:02.985 --> 00:17:04.403
Wow.

277
00:17:05.404 --> 00:17:07.281
It's all right.

278
00:17:09.575 --> 00:17:12.578
-Holy shit.
-You're gonna be fine.

279
00:17:12.662 --> 00:17:15.248
Come with me.

280
00:17:15.331 --> 00:17:17.041
And stop fidgeting.

281
00:17:17.124 --> 00:17:18.876
Good evening, Mr Lewis.

282
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.254
- Hello. You have messages?
- Yes, several.

283
00:17:26.968 --> 00:17:29.595
Could you send up
champagne and strawberries?

284
00:17:29.679 --> 00:17:31.097
Of course.

285
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.933
Room service
for Mr Lewis, please.

286
00:17:44.277 --> 00:17:46.612
Oh, honey.

287
00:17:46.696 --> 00:17:50.366
You know what's happened?
I've got a runner in my pantyhose.

288
00:17:51.867 --> 00:17:54.787
I'm not wearing pantyhose.

289
00:17:58.624 --> 00:18:02.211
Well, colour me happy.
There's a sofa in here for two.

290
00:18:03.921 --> 00:18:07.049
- First time in an elevator.
- Ah.

291
00:18:08.092 --> 00:18:10.636
Close your mouth, dear.

292
00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:15.891
Sorry. Couldn't help it.

293
00:18:15.975 --> 00:18:17.935
Try.

294
00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:25.568
Penthouse.

295
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:28.404
- The penthouse. Ooh.
- Yes.

296
00:18:29.322 --> 00:18:31.407
To the left.

297
00:18:49.258 --> 00:18:50.926
I miss keys.

298
00:19:06.317 --> 00:19:08.027
You impressed?

299
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.112
You kidding?
I come here all the time.

300
00:19:10.196 --> 00:19:13.324
- They do rent this by the hour.
- Sure.

301
00:19:16.702 --> 00:19:18.788
Wow. Great view.

302
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:21.707
I bet you can see all the way
to the ocean from out here.

303
00:19:21.791 --> 00:19:24.251
I'll take your word for it.
I don't go out there.

304
00:19:24.335 --> 00:19:26.295
Why don't you
go out there?

305
00:19:26.379 --> 00:19:29.799
- I'm afraid of heights.
- You are?

306
00:19:29.882 --> 00:19:31.967
How come you rented
the penthouse?

307
00:19:32.051 --> 00:19:33.928
It's the best.

308
00:19:34.011 --> 00:19:37.973
I looked for penthouses on
the first floor, but I can't find one.

309
00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.687
Well, now that you
have me here,

310
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.730
what are you going
to do with me?

311
00:19:44.814 --> 00:19:47.274
You want to know something?
I don't have a clue.

312
00:19:47.358 --> 00:19:50.736
- No?
- I hadn't exactly planned this.

313
00:19:50.903 --> 00:19:53.531
Well, do you plan everything?

314
00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:55.574
Always.

315
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:57.368
Yeah, me too.

316
00:19:57.451 --> 00:20:00.705
I'm actually... No, I'm not
a planner. I wouldn't say I was.

317
00:20:00.788 --> 00:20:04.834
I would say I was a kind of
fly by the seat of my pants gal.

318
00:20:04.917 --> 00:20:07.420
You know, moment to moment.
That's me.

319
00:20:07.503 --> 00:20:09.046
That's... Yeah.

320
00:20:13.008 --> 00:20:16.554
You know, you could pay me.
That's one way to break the ice.

321
00:20:16.637 --> 00:20:18.764
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

322
00:20:18.848 --> 00:20:21.475
Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

323
00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:23.936
Cash works for me. Yeah.

324
00:20:31.652 --> 00:20:33.821
You're on my fax.

325
00:20:34.989 --> 00:20:37.491
Well, that's one
I haven't been on before.

326
00:20:40.411 --> 00:20:42.621
Very cute. Thank you.

327
00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:45.166
All right, here we go.

328
00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:47.877
Pick one.
I got red, green, yellow.

329
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.130
I'm out of purple, but I do have
one gold circle coin left.

330
00:20:51.213 --> 00:20:53.382
The condom of champions,
the one and only.

331
00:20:53.466 --> 00:20:56.469
Nothing is getting through
this sucker. What do you say?

332
00:20:56.552 --> 00:20:59.680
- A buffet of safety.
- I'm a safety girl.

333
00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:06.729
- Let's get one of these on you.
- No.

334
00:21:12.067 --> 00:21:14.111
Why don't we talk
for a little bit.

335
00:21:14.195 --> 00:21:15.780
Talk.

336
00:21:15.863 --> 00:21:20.451
Yeah, um, OK.

337
00:21:20.534 --> 00:21:24.747
Edward, are you in town
on business or pleasure?

338
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.833
- Business, I think.
- Business, you think.

339
00:21:29.502 --> 00:21:30.920
Well...

340
00:21:32.004 --> 00:21:35.257
Let me guess.
That would make you...

341
00:21:35.341 --> 00:21:38.344
- A lawyer.
- A lawyer?

342
00:21:40.095 --> 00:21:41.889
What makes you think
I'm a lawyer?

343
00:21:41.972 --> 00:21:45.893
You've got that sharp
useless look about you.

344
00:21:48.187 --> 00:21:50.606
I bet you've known
a lot of lawyers.

345
00:21:50.689 --> 00:21:52.525
I've known a lot of everybody.

346
00:21:52.608 --> 00:21:56.320
What is that?

347
00:21:58.697 --> 00:22:00.950
- Champagne.
- Oh.

348
00:22:01.033 --> 00:22:04.537
Well, might as well
make myself useful.

349
00:22:05.412 --> 00:22:07.164
Take a load off.

350
00:22:13.462 --> 00:22:15.422
- Good evening.
- Hi.

351
00:22:18.259 --> 00:22:20.094
Where would you like it?

352
00:22:20.177 --> 00:22:22.847
- Where would we like it?
- Over by the bar.

353
00:22:32.064 --> 00:22:34.817
- Excuse me.
- It'll be on your bill, Mr Lewis.

354
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.861
Thank you.

355
00:22:39.405 --> 00:22:41.907
What are you looking at?

356
00:22:41.991 --> 00:22:45.077
- What is he looking at?
- Ah, yes.

357
00:22:45.202 --> 00:22:47.162
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

358
00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:49.290
Thank you, sir.
Have a nice night.

359
00:22:49.415 --> 00:22:51.417
Tip. Wow.

360
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.337
- I missed that one.
- Don't worry about it.

361
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:58.173
- You mind if I take my boots off?
- Not at all.

362
00:22:58.257 --> 00:23:01.427
So, do you have a wife?
Girlfriend?

363
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.971
- I have both.
- Where are they?

364
00:23:04.096 --> 00:23:06.765
Shopping together?

365
00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:10.728
My ex-wife is now
in Long Island,

366
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:13.939
in my ex-home
with my ex-dog.

367
00:23:17.443 --> 00:23:19.153
There you go.

368
00:23:19.236 --> 00:23:22.823
My ex-girlfriend, Jessica,
is in New York,

369
00:23:22.907 --> 00:23:26.744
moving out of my apartment
even as we speak.

370
00:23:33.709 --> 00:23:37.296
- You should try a strawberry.
- Why?

371
00:23:37.379 --> 00:23:39.924
It brings out the flavour
in the champagne.

372
00:23:40.007 --> 00:23:41.967
Oh. Groovy.

373
00:23:50.309 --> 00:23:51.644
Pretty good.

374
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.149
- Don't you drink?
- No.

375
00:24:00.569 --> 00:24:04.198
Listen, I-I appreciate this whole
seduction scene you got going,

376
00:24:04.323 --> 00:24:05.991
but let me give you a tip.

377
00:24:06.075 --> 00:24:07.159
I'm a sure thing, OK?

378
00:24:07.242 --> 00:24:10.037
I'm on an hourly rate.
Can we move it along?

379
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.582
I'm sensing that this time problem
IS a major issue with you.

380
00:24:13.666 --> 00:24:16.627
- Why don't we get through that now?
- Let's get started.

381
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.380
How much for the entire night?

382
00:24:20.547 --> 00:24:22.508
Stay here?

383
00:24:24.343 --> 00:24:27.262
- You couldn't afford it.
- Try me.

384
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:30.432
- Three hundred dollars.
- Done.

385
00:24:30.516 --> 00:24:33.769
Thank you.
Now we can relax.

386
00:24:41.694 --> 00:24:46.198
I'll be out in a minute.
That champagne got to me.

387
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:49.910
- What did you say?
- I said I'd be out in just a minute.

388
00:24:51.745 --> 00:24:54.331
What is... What do you have?
What are you hiding?

389
00:24:54.415 --> 00:24:56.333
Nothing.

390
00:25:00.087 --> 00:25:02.464
All right, I do not want
any drugs here.

391
00:25:02.548 --> 00:25:05.342
I don't want this.
Get your money and please leave.

392
00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:08.679
I don't do drugs. I stopped
doing drugs when I was 14.

393
00:25:08.762 --> 00:25:10.889
What is this?

394
00:25:13.726 --> 00:25:16.603
- This is dental floss.
- Yeah? So?

395
00:25:16.729 --> 00:25:19.023
I had all those
strawberry seeds.

396
00:25:19.106 --> 00:25:21.775
And you shouldn't
neglect your gums.

397
00:25:23.235 --> 00:25:25.863
I'm sorry.
Please, continue.

398
00:25:25.946 --> 00:25:28.032
Thank you.

399
00:25:33.787 --> 00:25:36.957
- Are you gonna watch?
- No, I'm going.

400
00:25:41.086 --> 00:25:42.421
Thank you.

401
00:25:44.089 --> 00:25:47.968
It's just that, uh,
very few... people surprise me.

402
00:25:48.677 --> 00:25:51.764
You're lucky. Most of them
shock the hell out of me.

403
00:25:55.934 --> 00:25:58.103
- You're watching.
- I'm going.

404
00:26:13.452 --> 00:26:15.287
Yes, that may be true.

405
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.915
I still need the numbers

406
00:26:17.998 --> 00:26:20.751
on Morse Industries.

407
00:26:20.834 --> 00:26:22.294
Uh-huh.

408
00:26:22.377 --> 00:26:24.963
I got them from London.
I need them from Tokyo.

409
00:26:25.089 --> 00:26:27.382
I'll call down and get them
when I want them.

410
00:26:27.591 --> 00:26:29.218
Thank you very much.

411
00:26:30.886 --> 00:26:33.180
I have a little
carpet picnic here.

412
00:26:33.305 --> 00:26:35.682
Are you sure you
don't want a drink?

413
00:26:36.683 --> 00:26:38.602
I'm high on life.
Can't you tell?

414
00:26:49.238 --> 00:26:52.324
You know,
I never saw this episode.

415
00:28:34.551 --> 00:28:36.094
What do you want?

416
00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.598
- What do you do?
- Everything.

417
00:28:40.933 --> 00:28:42.893
But I don't kiss on the mouth.

418
00:28:42.976 --> 00:28:45.646
Neither do I.

419
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:48.834
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good, thank you.

420
00:29:48.917 --> 00:29:51.003
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Thompson.

421
00:29:51.128 --> 00:29:53.130
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

422
00:29:53.213 --> 00:29:55.757
- Morning, Mr Thompson.
- Morning, Marjorie.

423
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:58.176
Morse is going to fight.
It's to be expected.

424
00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.178
He's run his company
for a long time.

425
00:30:00.262 --> 00:30:03.140
He's not ready to have
his name taken off the stationery.

426
00:30:03.265 --> 00:30:05.475
He wants to meet you
face-to-face.

427
00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:07.060
- OK.
<i>- I wouldn't do it.</i>

428
00:30:07.144 --> 00:30:10.230
You wouldn't, but do it anyhow.
Tonight. Dinner.

429
00:30:10.314 --> 00:30:13.233
Oh, Edward, it's really not
a good idea that you see him,

430
00:30:13.358 --> 00:30:15.068
definitely not alone.

431
00:30:15.152 --> 00:30:16.570
He's a feisty old guy.

432
00:30:16.695 --> 00:30:19.197
We say the wrong thing,
we could wind up in court.

433
00:30:19.281 --> 00:30:21.992
There's always a possibility
things'll go wrong.

434
00:30:22.075 --> 00:30:24.911
That's why I enjoy this so much.

435
00:30:24.995 --> 00:30:28.498
- By the way, Phil, about your car...
- Oh, God, what?

436
00:30:28.582 --> 00:30:30.625
It corners like it's on rails.

437
00:30:30.709 --> 00:30:32.210
What? What does that mean?

438
00:30:32.294 --> 00:30:34.004
<i>Edward? Edward?</i>

439
00:30:36.048 --> 00:30:37.174
Hi.

440
00:30:38.425 --> 00:30:40.719
Well, good morning.

441
00:30:41.678 --> 00:30:42.846
Red.

442
00:30:43.555 --> 00:30:44.806
Better.

443
00:30:47.392 --> 00:30:49.936
You didn't wake me.
I can see you're really busy.

444
00:30:50.062 --> 00:30:52.564
- I'll be out in a minute.
- There's no hurry.

445
00:30:53.482 --> 00:30:55.359
Are you hungry?
You must be.

446
00:30:55.442 --> 00:30:58.070
Why don't you sit
and have something to eat?

447
00:31:00.072 --> 00:31:01.406
I...

448
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.909
...took the liberty
of ordering everything.

449
00:31:03.992 --> 00:31:05.619
I didn't know
what you'd like.

450
00:31:06.286 --> 00:31:08.747
- Thanks.
- All right? Good.

451
00:31:13.752 --> 00:31:16.505
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah. Too good.

452
00:31:16.588 --> 00:31:19.925
- Forgot where I was.
- Occupational hazard?

453
00:31:20.926 --> 00:31:22.511
Yeah.

454
00:31:22.886 --> 00:31:24.054
Did you sleep?

455
00:31:24.888 --> 00:31:27.224
Uh, yes, a little
on the couch.

456
00:31:28.392 --> 00:31:30.477
I was, uh, working last night.

457
00:31:30.602 --> 00:31:34.398
You don't sleep, you don't do drugs,
you don't drink.

458
00:31:34.523 --> 00:31:37.442
You hardly eat.
What do you do, Edward?

459
00:31:37.526 --> 00:31:40.445
- 'Cause I know you're not a lawyer.
- That's right.

460
00:31:41.947 --> 00:31:44.282
There are
four other chairs here.

461
00:31:45.367 --> 00:31:46.827
Oh.

462
00:31:51.957 --> 00:31:55.377
- So, what do you do?
- I buy companies.

463
00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.712
What kind of companies?

464
00:31:57.796 --> 00:32:02.551
Well, I buy companies that are
in financial difficulty.

465
00:32:02.634 --> 00:32:05.053
If they have problems,
you must get a bargain.

466
00:32:05.137 --> 00:32:07.722
Well, the company
I'm buying this week

467
00:32:07.806 --> 00:32:10.725
I'm getting for the bargain
price of about one billion.

468
00:32:12.811 --> 00:32:15.605
- A billion dollars?
- Yes.

469
00:32:15.689 --> 00:32:18.316
Wow. You must be
really smart, huh?

470
00:32:20.902 --> 00:32:22.904
I only got through
eleventh grade.

471
00:32:23.947 --> 00:32:26.867
How far did you go
in school?

472
00:32:26.992 --> 00:32:28.493
I went all the way.

473
00:32:32.038 --> 00:32:35.333
Your folks must be
really proud, huh?

474
00:32:43.008 --> 00:32:44.759
So, you don't actually have

475
00:32:44.843 --> 00:32:46.720
a billion dollars, huh?

476
00:32:46.803 --> 00:32:50.390
No, I get some of it
from banks, investors.

477
00:32:50.515 --> 00:32:52.559
It's not an easy thing to do.

478
00:32:53.101 --> 00:32:56.188
You don't make anything and
you don't build anything?

479
00:32:56.855 --> 00:32:59.983
- What do you do with the companies?
- I sell them.

480
00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:02.235
Here, let me do that.
You sell them?

481
00:33:02.319 --> 00:33:05.238
Well, I don't sell
the whole company.

482
00:33:05.322 --> 00:33:07.365
I break it up into pieces
and sell that.

483
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:11.203
- If it's worth more than the whole.
- So, it's like, um...

484
00:33:11.286 --> 00:33:14.247
stealing cars and selling them
for the parts?

485
00:33:15.582 --> 00:33:18.168
- Yeah, sort of. But legal.
- Mm-hm.

486
00:33:18.877 --> 00:33:20.462
There. Now it's perfect.

487
00:33:20.545 --> 00:33:24.382
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Where'd you learn to do that?

488
00:33:24.508 --> 00:33:27.969
Well, I screwed
the debate team in high school.

489
00:33:29.554 --> 00:33:31.431
I had a grandpa.
He was nice to me.

490
00:33:31.515 --> 00:33:33.558
He liked ties on Sundays.

491
00:33:33.642 --> 00:33:36.561
Mind if I take a swim
in your tub before I go?

492
00:33:36.686 --> 00:33:39.397
Not at all. Just stay
in the shallow end.

493
00:33:42.526 --> 00:33:46.238
-<i>Hello?</i>
-It's Phil. I wanted to let you know

- That's good.

495
00:33:48.573 --> 00:33:51.743
He's bringing his grandson.
He's grooming him to take over.

496
00:33:51.826 --> 00:33:55.413
Oh, yes. A very intense
young man named David.

497
00:33:55.539 --> 00:33:57.874

- Look, I gotta say this again.

498
00:33:57.958 --> 00:33:59.834

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.532
Vivian, I have a business
proposition for you.

521
00:35:12.616 --> 00:35:15.493
- What do you want?
- I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.

522
00:35:15.577 --> 00:35:17.621
I'd like you
to spend the week with me.

523
00:35:19.497 --> 00:35:22.250
- Really?
- Yes.

524
00:35:22.334 --> 00:35:24.711
Yes, I'd like to hire you
as an employee.

525
00:35:24.794 --> 00:35:28.089
Would you consider
spending the week with me?

526
00:35:29.674 --> 00:35:32.093
I will pay you to be
at my beck and call.

527
00:35:33.803 --> 00:35:36.723
I'd love to be your
"beck and call" girl, but...

528
00:35:36.848 --> 00:35:38.808
...you're a rich,
good-looking guy.

529
00:35:38.892 --> 00:35:41.895
You could get
a million girls free.

530
00:35:41.978 --> 00:35:43.605
I want a professional.

531
00:35:43.688 --> 00:35:46.524
I don't need any
romantic hassles this week.

532
00:35:48.526 --> 00:35:51.529
If you're talking 24 hours
a day, it's gonna cost you.

533
00:35:51.613 --> 00:35:54.407
Ohh. Yes, of course.

534
00:35:54.532 --> 00:35:57.160
All right. Here we go.

535
00:35:57.243 --> 00:35:59.412
Give me a ballpark figure.
How much?

536
00:35:59.537 --> 00:36:02.874
Six full nights.
Days too.

537
00:36:04.542 --> 00:36:05.960
Four thousand.

538
00:36:06.044 --> 00:36:08.630
Six nights at 300 is 1800.

539
00:36:08.713 --> 00:36:10.048
You want days too.

540
00:36:10.131 --> 00:36:12.217
- Two thousand.
- Three thousand.

541
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.261
- Done.
- Holy shit!

542
00:36:19.557 --> 00:36:21.518
Vivian.

543
00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:23.978
Vivian, is that a yes?

544
00:36:26.606 --> 00:36:28.692
Yes.

545
00:36:29.401 --> 00:36:31.027
Yes!

546
00:36:31.111 --> 00:36:34.155
I'll be gone most of the day.
I want you to buy some clothes.

547
00:36:34.239 --> 00:36:36.199
You should get
traveller's checks.

548
00:36:36.282 --> 00:36:38.952
We may be going out.
You'll need something to wear.

549
00:36:39.077 --> 00:36:42.205
- Like what?
- Nothing too flashy.

550
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.375
Not too sexy. Conservative.
You understand?

551
00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:48.461
- Boring.
- Elegant.

552
00:36:48.545 --> 00:36:51.381
- Any questions?
- Can I call you Eddie?

553
00:36:51.464 --> 00:36:53.091
Not if you
expect me to answer.

554
00:36:53.216 --> 00:36:55.427
I would've stayed
for two thousand.

555
00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.056
I would've paid four.
I'll see you tonight.

556
00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.100
Baby, I'm gonna
treat you so nice,

557
00:37:02.183 --> 00:37:04.394
you're never gonna
want to let me go.

558
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:08.648
Three thousand for six days.

559
00:37:08.773 --> 00:37:10.775
And, Vivian, I will let you go.

560
00:37:14.904 --> 00:37:17.282
But I'm here now.

561
00:37:28.626 --> 00:37:32.088
Three thousand dollars!

562
00:37:37.218 --> 00:37:39.179
Ooh.

563
00:37:44.476 --> 00:37:47.937
- Hello.
- I called and called. Where were you?

564
00:37:48.021 --> 00:37:49.939
- Ma?
<i>- It's Viv.</i>

565
00:37:50.023 --> 00:37:52.692
Oh, hi. I had to party.
Where are you?

566
00:37:52.817 --> 00:37:54.444
Oh, man,
are you ready for this?

567
00:37:54.527 --> 00:37:56.488
The guy? The Lotus?

568
00:37:56.613 --> 00:37:59.949
I am in his hotel room
in Beverly Hills, the penthouse.

569
00:38:00.033 --> 00:38:02.368
His bathroom is bigger
than the Blue Banana.

570
00:38:02.494 --> 00:38:03.620
Do I have to hear this?

571
00:38:04.662 --> 00:38:06.414
He wants me to stay
the whole week.

572
00:38:06.498 --> 00:38:09.334
You know what he's gonna
give me? You'll never guess.

573
00:38:09.459 --> 00:38:12.754
<i>- Three thousand dollars.</i>
- Bullshit!

574
00:38:12.837 --> 00:38:15.340
I swear to God,
and extra money to buy clothes.

575
00:38:15.465 --> 00:38:18.843
Oh, man, I am bummed!
I gave that guy to you!

576
00:38:18.927 --> 00:38:21.596
Three thousand. Really?
Is he twisted?

577
00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:23.348
- No.
<i>- Ugly?</i>

578
00:38:23.473 --> 00:38:25.600
- He's good-looking.
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

579
00:38:25.683 --> 00:38:27.644
- Nothing.
- Did he give you the money?

580
00:38:27.727 --> 00:38:30.146
<i>- At the end of the week.</i>
- That's what's wrong.

581
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:33.942
Well, he gave me 300
for last night, and, Kit,

582
00:38:34.025 --> 00:38:36.653
I'm gonna leave some
at the front desk for you.

583
00:38:36.736 --> 00:38:39.989
<i>I'm at the Regent Beverly
Wilshire. Write it down.</i>

584
00:38:40.073 --> 00:38:43.117
<i>Are you writing it down?
You'll forget it. Write it down.</i>

00:38:43.201 --> 00:38:47.121

586
00:38:47.205 --> 00:38:50.875
One more thing. Where do I go
for the clothes? Good stuff, on him.

587
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.627
- In Beverly Hills?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

588
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.255

589
00:38:59.843 --> 00:39:01.886

- Yes, ma'am. May I help you?

590
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:05.181
I'm leavin' this here for Kit DE Luca.
She's gonna pick it up.

Well. I didn't ask if it would fit.
I asked how much it was.

615

How much is this, Marie?

616
00:40:59.003 --> 00:41:01.255
It's very expensive.

617
00:41:01.339 --> 00:41:03.174

00:41:03.299 --> 00:41:05.593

I don't think we have
anything for you.

Please leave.

622

Tiffany's taking

We're very excited about
the whole thing.

624
00:41:46.718 --> 00:41:49.178
Do you realise Via Rodeo
is the first new street

625
00:41:49.303 --> 00:41:51.347
in Beverly Hills in 75 years?

626
00:41:53.433 --> 00:41:55.977
- Excuse me. May I help you?
- I'm going to my room.

627
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.313
- Do you have a key?
- I forgot that cardboard thing.

628
00:41:59.397 --> 00:42:02.483
- I'm on the top floor.
- You're a guest here?

629
00:42:02.567 --> 00:42:05.069
- I'm with a friend.
- Who would that be?

630
00:42:06.237 --> 00:42:07.989
- Edward.
- Edward?

631
00:42:08.072 --> 00:42:10.241
Edward... uh...

632
00:42:11.784 --> 00:42:15.663
- He knows me.
- Dennis.

633
00:42:15.747 --> 00:42:18.332
Dennis, did you just
come off the night shift?

634
00:42:18.416 --> 00:42:21.794
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know this young lady?

635
00:42:21.919 --> 00:42:24.005
- She's with Mr Lewis.
- Mr Lewis?

636
00:42:24.088 --> 00:42:26.674
That's it. Edward Lewis.
Thanks, Dennis.

637
00:42:26.799 --> 00:42:29.886
- Evidently she joined him last night.
- Thank you.

638
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.973
Oh, God, what now?
What? What?

639
00:42:34.098 --> 00:42:36.893
- What is with everybody?
- Come with me and have a chat.

640
00:42:36.976 --> 00:42:38.978
- I'm coming.
- Thank you, Dennis.

641
00:42:39.062 --> 00:42:42.190
- What is your name, miss?
- What do you want it to be?

642
00:42:42.273 --> 00:42:45.485
- Don't play with me, young lady.
- Vivian.

643
00:42:45.568 --> 00:42:47.737
Thank you. Vivian.

644
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.989
Well, Miss Vivian,

645
00:42:51.074 --> 00:42:52.825
things that go on
in other hotels

646
00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:55.328
don't happen at
the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

647
00:42:55.411 --> 00:42:58.164
Mr Lewis, however,
is a very special customer,

648
00:42:58.289 --> 00:43:01.459
and we like to think of our
special customers as friends.

649
00:43:01.542 --> 00:43:04.003
As a customer,
we would expect Mr Lewis

650
00:43:04.087 --> 00:43:06.255
to sign in
any additional guests,

651
00:43:06.339 --> 00:43:08.716
but as a friend,
we're willing to overlook it.

652
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.803
Now, I'm assuming
that you're a...

653
00:43:12.845 --> 00:43:14.680
...relative?

654
00:43:14.764 --> 00:43:17.475
- Yes.
- I thought so.

655
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.144
Then you must be his...

656
00:43:22.105 --> 00:43:24.440
- Niece?
- Of course.

657
00:43:24.524 --> 00:43:26.526
Naturally,
when Mr Lewis leaves,

658
00:43:26.651 --> 00:43:28.778
I won't see you
in this hotel again.

659
00:43:30.446 --> 00:43:32.907
I assume you have
no other uncles here?

660
00:43:34.075 --> 00:43:36.244
Then we understand each other.

661
00:43:36.327 --> 00:43:38.996
I encourage you
to dress more appropriately.

662
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.958
- That will be all.
- That's what I was trying to do.

663
00:43:42.041 --> 00:43:44.544
I tried to go get a dress
on Rodeo Drive today,

664
00:43:44.669 --> 00:43:46.462
and the women wouldn't help me.

665
00:43:46.587 --> 00:43:49.090
I have all this money,
and no dress.

666
00:43:49.173 --> 00:43:51.050
Not that I expect your help,

667
00:43:51.175 --> 00:43:53.261
I have to buy a dress
for dinner tonight.

668
00:43:53.344 --> 00:43:56.013
And nobody will help me.

669
00:44:08.359 --> 00:44:10.444
Oh, man, if you are calling
the cops...

670
00:44:10.528 --> 00:44:13.823
Yeah, call the cops. Great.
Tell them I said hi.

671
00:44:13.906 --> 00:44:15.283
Women's clothing.

672
00:44:16.576 --> 00:44:18.703
Bridget, please.

673
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:30.006
Bridget, hello.
This is Barnard Thompson

674
00:44:30.089 --> 00:44:31.966
here at the Regent Beverly Wil...

675
00:44:33.467 --> 00:44:37.722
Thank you. Yes, but I'd like you
to do a favour for me, please.

676
00:44:37.805 --> 00:44:40.558
I'm sending someone over.
Her name is Vivian.

677
00:44:40.683 --> 00:44:42.768
She's a special guest.

678
00:44:42.852 --> 00:44:46.522
She's the niece
of a very special guest.

679
00:44:47.565 --> 00:44:49.817
This is the jewel
in Morse's crown.

680
00:44:49.901 --> 00:44:53.571
Prime industrial property
straddling Long Beach and Los Angeles.

681
00:44:53.696 --> 00:44:55.489
Possibilities are endless.

682
00:44:55.573 --> 00:44:57.491
Most of the yard
we'll just level.

683
00:44:58.159 --> 00:45:01.954
- I just got the information.
- Edward, we just got the Morse update.

684
00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:04.248
Don, can you hold
the projection, please?

685
00:45:05.917 --> 00:45:08.002
Yeah? What?
Speak.

686
00:45:08.085 --> 00:45:11.881
Old man Morse just got the inside track
on a $350 million contract

687
00:45:11.964 --> 00:45:14.342
to build destroyers
for the navy.

688
00:45:14.425 --> 00:45:17.261
Navy contract.
I can't believe this.

689
00:45:17.386 --> 00:45:19.931
I thought you said
they had nothing in the hopper.

690
00:45:20.014 --> 00:45:22.850
- I thought they didn't.
- That could cost a lot more.

691
00:45:22.934 --> 00:45:25.853
- Stocks could go through the roof.
- No shit, Sherlock.

692
00:45:25.978 --> 00:45:28.689
Maybe we're lucky to get
this information now, sir.

693
00:45:28.773 --> 00:45:31.275
-We can still walk away.
-Walk away?

694
00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:34.779
We got a thousand man-hours on this.
Nobody's walking away.

695
00:45:34.904 --> 00:45:37.573
- I think he's right.
- I don't want to hear it!

696
00:45:37.657 --> 00:45:40.368
Gentlemen, relax. Relax.

697
00:45:40.451 --> 00:45:43.496
Who do we know on the Senate
Appropriations Committee?

698
00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:46.457
- Senator Adams.
- Senator Adams. Find out where he is.

699
00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.460
The navy's not going to spend
$350 million on anything

700
00:45:49.543 --> 00:45:51.712
without going
to Appropriations first.

701
00:45:51.796 --> 00:45:54.131
I don't understand
what's going on.

702
00:45:54.215 --> 00:45:56.759
That's why I hired you,
to do my worrying for me.

703
00:45:56.884 --> 00:45:59.762
I'll be in your office.
Bob, send over the geologicals.

704
00:45:59.845 --> 00:46:01.222
- No problem.
- Thank you.

705
00:46:01.305 --> 00:46:04.475
Listen, everything all set
for the meeting tonight?

706
00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.145
- Mm-hm.
- Who is this girl you're going with?

707
00:46:09.313 --> 00:46:10.940
Nobody you know.

708
00:46:11.023 --> 00:46:13.234
Edward Lewis Enterprises.

709
00:46:13.317 --> 00:46:15.820
Phil Stuckey.
Yes, I have him right here.

710
00:46:15.945 --> 00:46:18.906
Don't worry, Mrs Ramey.
I'll call you when it comes in.

711
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.450
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

712
00:46:26.872 --> 00:46:29.792
Hello. You must be Vivian.
My name's Bridget.

713
00:46:29.875 --> 00:46:32.628
Yeah, hi. Barney said
you'd be nice to me.

714
00:46:32.753 --> 00:46:34.630
He's very sweet.

715
00:46:34.714 --> 00:46:36.924
What are your plans
while you're in town?

716
00:46:37.008 --> 00:46:39.510
- I'm gonna have dinner.
- Don't sit there, dear.

717
00:46:39.635 --> 00:46:41.846
- You're gonna go out? Dinner?
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:46:41.929 --> 00:46:45.057
You'll need a cocktail dress, then.
Come with me.

719
00:46:45.141 --> 00:46:48.185
I'm sure we'll find something
that your uncle would love.

720
00:46:48.269 --> 00:46:50.396
- You're a size six, right?
- Yeah.

721
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:53.107
- How'd you know that?
- That's my job.

722
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.694
- Bridge, he's not really my uncle.
- They never are, dear.

723
00:47:01.532 --> 00:47:03.993
Barney. Sorry, mister.

724
00:47:04.076 --> 00:47:06.954
- I got a dress.
- I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it.

725
00:47:07.038 --> 00:47:09.665
I didn't want to mess it up.
I got shoes. Wanna see?

726
00:47:09.749 --> 00:47:12.335
No, I'm sure they're
quite lovely. Thank you.

727
00:47:12.418 --> 00:47:14.879
I didn't mean to interrupt,
Bridget was great,

728
00:47:14.962 --> 00:47:17.798
and I wanted to say thanks.
You're cool.

729
00:47:17.882 --> 00:47:19.592
You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

730
00:47:26.474 --> 00:47:29.477
- Hello.
- Never, ever pick up the phone.

731
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.563
- Why are you calling me?
<i>- Did you buy clothes today?</i>

732
00:47:32.688 --> 00:47:35.358
- I got a dress, a cocktail one.
<i>- That's good.</i>

733
00:47:35.483 --> 00:47:38.069
I'll be in the hotel lobby
7:45 sharp.

734
00:47:38.194 --> 00:47:41.614
<i>- You're not coming to the door?</i>
- This isn't a date. It's business.

735
00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:43.741
Where are you taking me?

736
00:47:43.824 --> 00:47:45.910
To a restaurant
called the Voltaire.

737
00:47:45.993 --> 00:47:48.371
<i>- Very elegant.</i>
- All right.

738
00:47:48.496 --> 00:47:51.499
I'll meet you in the lobby
'cause you're paying me to.

739
00:47:51.582 --> 00:47:53.918
Well, thank you very much.

740
00:47:56.253 --> 00:47:59.048
Get her back for me, please.

741
00:47:59.131 --> 00:48:00.841
Mr Stuckey wanted to see you.

742
00:48:00.925 --> 00:48:04.887
Yes, tell him I'm in the middle
of an important phone call.

743
00:48:05.054 --> 00:48:07.431
Hello.

744
00:48:07.515 --> 00:48:11.143
- I told you not to pick up the phone.
- Then stop calling me.

745
00:48:14.438 --> 00:48:15.773
Sick.

746
00:48:17.108 --> 00:48:19.610
Barney.

747
00:48:19.693 --> 00:48:22.905
- It didn't fit.
- Oh, no, no, no.

748
00:48:22.988 --> 00:48:24.907
I've got a little problem.

749
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:27.785
Right, Miss Vivian, one more time.
Dinner napkin.

750
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:31.122
Dinner napkin,
laid gently in the lap.

751
00:48:31.247 --> 00:48:33.833
Good. Elbows off the table.

752
00:48:33.958 --> 00:48:36.043
Don't slouch.

753
00:48:36.127 --> 00:48:38.045
Shrimp fork.

754
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.296
Salad fork.

755
00:48:39.422 --> 00:48:41.298
Dinner fork.

756
00:48:41.382 --> 00:48:42.967
I have the salad fork.

757
00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.886
The rest of the silverware
is a little confusing.

758
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.431
If you get nervous,
just count the tines.

759
00:48:48.514 --> 00:48:50.599
Four tines, dinner fork.

760
00:48:50.683 --> 00:48:54.812
And sometimes there are three tines.
The salad fork.

761
00:48:54.937 --> 00:48:55.980
And sometimes...

762
00:49:09.243 --> 00:49:10.494
Pardon me, Mr Lewis.

763
00:49:10.578 --> 00:49:12.913
I'm Mr Thompson,
the manager of the hotel.

764
00:49:12.997 --> 00:49:14.331
I want to make one call.

765
00:49:14.457 --> 00:49:16.167
I have a message for you.

766
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.420
- From who?
- From your niece, sir.

767
00:49:19.503 --> 00:49:20.588
My what?

768
00:49:20.671 --> 00:49:23.174
The lady who's staying
with you in your room.

769
00:49:23.257 --> 00:49:25.009
Oh.

770
00:49:27.052 --> 00:49:29.847
- We both know she's not my niece.
- Of course.

771
00:49:29.972 --> 00:49:32.600
The reason I know that
is that I am an only child.

772
00:49:33.225 --> 00:49:34.810
Yes, sir.

773
00:49:34.894 --> 00:49:37.813
- What's the message?
- She's waiting in the lounge.

774
00:49:39.106 --> 00:49:42.568
Intriguing young lady,
Miss Vivian.

775
00:49:42.651 --> 00:49:45.112
- Intriguing.
- Have a good evening, sir.

776
00:49:46.489 --> 00:49:48.866
- Thank you, Mr...
- Thompson. I'm the...

777
00:49:48.949 --> 00:49:51.869
...manager of the hotel, sir.

778
00:50:28.447 --> 00:50:30.241
You're late.

779
00:50:30.324 --> 00:50:31.992
You're stunning.

780
00:50:32.117 --> 00:50:34.078
You're forgiven.

781
00:50:36.372 --> 00:50:38.290
Shall we go to dinner?

782
00:50:51.053 --> 00:50:53.597
This way.
Your party's waiting.

783
00:50:53.722 --> 00:50:55.140
Stop fidgeting.

784
00:50:58.227 --> 00:51:02.106
- Mr Morse.
- Yes, Mr Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

785
00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:06.610
This fireball
is my grandson, David.

786
00:51:06.694 --> 00:51:09.863
I don't know about fireball,
but grandson's true enough.

787
00:51:09.947 --> 00:51:12.658
I'm pleased to meet you both.
This is Vivian Ward.

788
00:51:13.325 --> 00:51:16.245
-I'm glad to meet you.
-Mr Morse. David.

789
00:51:16.328 --> 00:51:17.746
Please sit.

790
00:51:23.544 --> 00:51:25.629
Excuse me.

791
00:51:27.464 --> 00:51:29.216
Where are you going?

792
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.051
I'm going to the ladies' room.

793
00:51:32.636 --> 00:51:35.389
- Upstairs, to the right.
- OK.

794
00:51:35.472 --> 00:51:36.974
Excuse me.

795
00:51:37.099 --> 00:51:39.143
- Shall I order for you?
- Yeah.

796
00:51:41.437 --> 00:51:43.230
Please do so.
Thank you.

797
00:51:43.314 --> 00:51:45.232
I'll do that.

798
00:51:52.364 --> 00:51:56.952
My grandfather believes men who
create a company control its destiny.

799
00:51:57.036 --> 00:51:58.662
Where's the salad?

800
00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:02.416
The salad comes
at the end of the meal.

801
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:04.168
But that's the fork I know.

802
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:08.631
Let me
put it another way.

803
00:52:08.714 --> 00:52:12.176
Between your public statements
and the rumours flying around,

804
00:52:12.301 --> 00:52:15.012
it's hard to figure out
what your intentions are.

805
00:52:15.095 --> 00:52:18.932
I've never been able
to figure which goes with what.

806
00:52:35.282 --> 00:52:38.035
At one time we built
ships the size of cities.

807
00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.412
Men like my grandfather
made this country.

808
00:52:40.537 --> 00:52:42.831
- Who ordered this?
- The gentleman did.

809
00:52:42.915 --> 00:52:45.334
-Bon appetit.
-These are <i>escargot</i>.

810
00:52:45.417 --> 00:52:48.796
It's French for snails.
It's a delicacy. Try it.

811
00:52:49.797 --> 00:52:52.675
- David.
- If you were to get control,

812
00:52:52.758 --> 00:52:54.968
and I don't think you will,
but if you did,

813
00:52:55.052 --> 00:52:57.888
what do you plan
to do with the company?

814
00:52:57.971 --> 00:52:59.973
Break it up
and sell off the pieces.

815
00:53:00.057 --> 00:53:02.976
I'm sure you'll understand
I'm not thrilled at the idea

816
00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:07.022
of your turning 40 years
of my work into your garage sale.

817
00:53:07.106 --> 00:53:09.149
At the price I'm paying
for this stock,

818
00:53:09.233 --> 00:53:12.736
- you are going to be a very rich man.
- I'm rich enough.

819
00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.406
I just want to have
my shipyard.

820
00:53:18.992 --> 00:53:20.786
Slippery little suckers.

821
00:53:22.871 --> 00:53:24.623
It happens all the time.

822
00:53:27.084 --> 00:53:29.169
I met your father.
What's his name?

823
00:53:30.921 --> 00:53:33.048
- Carter.
- Yeah, Carter.

824
00:53:33.132 --> 00:53:34.341
Carter Lewis.

825
00:53:34.425 --> 00:53:37.469
He's not quite the bastard
everybody says he is.

826
00:53:37.594 --> 00:53:40.889
- No, I have the franchise on that.
- Does that make him proud?

827
00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:43.142
I doubt it.

828
00:53:43.267 --> 00:53:45.769
It doesn't really matter now.
He passed away.

829
00:53:46.687 --> 00:53:48.439
I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.

830
00:53:48.522 --> 00:53:50.399
I'm sorry too.

831
00:53:50.482 --> 00:53:52.985
Mr Morse, you asked
for this meeting.

832
00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:56.864
- What can I do for you?
- Leave my company alone.

833
00:53:56.947 --> 00:53:59.366
I can't do that.
I own ten million shares.

834
00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:02.244
- I'll buy your stock back.
- You don't have money.

835
00:54:02.327 --> 00:54:04.955
We're getting a contract
to build destroyers.

836
00:54:05.038 --> 00:54:08.542
There will be no contract.
It is now buried in Appropriations,

837
00:54:08.625 --> 00:54:12.129
- and it will remain there.
- How did you pull that? Do you got...

838
00:54:12.212 --> 00:54:14.548
You got dirty politicians
in your pockets?

839
00:54:14.631 --> 00:54:16.467
Easy.
Calm down, David.

840
00:54:16.592 --> 00:54:20.804
- Mr Lewis plays hardball.
- Yes, I do.

841
00:54:20.888 --> 00:54:23.348
I've heard enough.
Vivian, it was a pleasure.

842
00:54:23.474 --> 00:54:26.894
I'm sorry.
I've got to get some air.

843
00:54:26.977 --> 00:54:30.314
- Mr Lewis.
- I'd better join my grandson.

844
00:54:30.439 --> 00:54:34.026
You two enjoy your dinner.
I'm sure it will be delicious.

845
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:35.319
Good luck, miss.

846
00:54:36.153 --> 00:54:40.199
Watch out, Lewis.
I'm gonna tear you apart.

847
00:54:41.158 --> 00:54:43.452
I look forward to it, sir.

848
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.714
Edward.

849
00:54:57.257 --> 00:54:59.468
You said you never
come out here.

850
00:55:00.636 --> 00:55:03.597
Well, I'm only halfway out.

851
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.434
You didn't say much in the car
on the way home.

852
00:55:07.518 --> 00:55:09.520
You thinking about dinner?

853
00:55:09.645 --> 00:55:11.104
I was a maniac.

854
00:55:11.188 --> 00:55:14.566
I mean, the business was good,
I think.

855
00:55:14.691 --> 00:55:18.028
He's in trouble.
You want his company.

856
00:55:18.111 --> 00:55:20.489
He doesn't want to let it go.

857
00:55:20.572 --> 00:55:22.366
Thanks for the recap.

858
00:55:22.491 --> 00:55:26.453
Problem is,
I think you like Mr Morse.

859
00:55:26.537 --> 00:55:29.790
I would like for you to get down.
You're making me nervous.

860
00:55:29.873 --> 00:55:31.583
It's making you nervous?

861
00:55:31.708 --> 00:55:35.295
What if I just lean back like this?
Would you rescue me if I fell?

862
00:55:35.379 --> 00:55:37.381
Vivian, I'm serious.
I'm not looking.

863
00:55:37.464 --> 00:55:39.883
It's really high.
Look, no hands. No hands.

864
00:55:40.008 --> 00:55:43.262
OK. All right, I'm sorry.

865
00:55:43.762 --> 00:55:45.764
The truth is,

866
00:55:45.848 --> 00:55:49.226
it really is totally irrelevant
whether I like this man or not.

867
00:55:49.351 --> 00:55:52.688
I will not let myself become
emotionally involved in business.

868
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:57.276
I know.
Kit's always saying to me,

869
00:55:57.359 --> 00:55:59.695
"Don't get emotional
when you turn tricks."

870
00:55:59.778 --> 00:56:02.531
That's why no kissing.
It's too personal.

871
00:56:02.614 --> 00:56:05.576
Like what you're saying.
Stay numb, don't get involved.

872
00:56:05.701 --> 00:56:08.912
When I'm with a guy,
I'm like a robot. I just do it.

873
00:56:14.585 --> 00:56:17.296
I mean... except with you.

874
00:56:17.421 --> 00:56:18.922
Of course, not with me.

875
00:56:21.675 --> 00:56:25.178
You and I are such
similar creatures, Vivian.

876
00:56:25.262 --> 00:56:27.598
We both screw people for money.

877
00:56:33.812 --> 00:56:35.772
I'm sorry to hear
about your dad.

878
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.484
- When did he die?
- Last month.

879
00:56:41.653 --> 00:56:43.280
Do you miss him?

880
00:56:45.449 --> 00:56:49.286
I hadn't spoken to him
in 14 and a half years.

881
00:56:50.454 --> 00:56:53.457
I wasn't there when he died.

882
00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.043
- Do you want to talk about this?
- No.

883
00:56:56.126 --> 00:56:58.045
Well, I'll tell you what.

884
00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:00.714
"Cause I got an idea.

885
00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:03.050
Let's watch old movies all night.

886
00:57:03.133 --> 00:57:06.053
We'll just veg out
in front of the TV.

887
00:57:06.136 --> 00:57:08.305
- "Veg out"?
- Yeah.

888
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:11.016
Be still like vegetables.
Lay like broccoli.

889
00:57:13.644 --> 00:57:15.812
I'll tell you what.
I'll be back.

890
00:57:15.938 --> 00:57:18.523
We'll do broccoli tomorrow.

891
00:57:19.983 --> 00:57:22.986
- Where are you going?
- Downstairs for awhile.

892
00:57:25.614 --> 00:57:28.158
<i>Did you say marriage license?</i>

893
00:57:28.283 --> 00:57:30.869
<i>Don't change the subject.
Just give me the stamp.</i>

894
00:57:30.953 --> 00:57:34.414
<i>Oh, I love you, Adam,
Alex, Peter, Brian,</i>

895
00:57:34.498 --> 00:57:35.832
<i>whatever your name is.</i>

896
00:57:35.916 --> 00:57:38.669
<i>Oh, I love you.</i>

897
00:57:50.514 --> 00:57:54.059
Hi. I'm in the penthouse.
The guy that was here...

898
00:57:54.184 --> 00:57:57.270
<i>Mr Lewis? Have you
seen him down there anywhere?</i>

899
00:58:37.686 --> 00:58:39.354
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

900
00:58:40.397 --> 00:58:42.733
I didn't know you played.

901
00:58:42.816 --> 00:58:44.526
I only play for strangers.

902
00:58:45.569 --> 00:58:48.363
I was getting lonely upstairs,
all by myself.

903
00:58:53.618 --> 00:58:55.746
Gentlemen?

904
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:57.706
Would you mind
leaving us, please?

905
00:59:00.667 --> 00:59:02.586
Thank you.

906
00:59:04.838 --> 00:59:07.674
People always do
what you tell them to do?

907
00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:41.166
I guess so.

908
01:00:40.016 --> 01:00:41.852
Wake up.
Time to shop.

909
01:00:45.105 --> 01:00:48.692
If you have any trouble using this card,
have them call the hotel.

910
01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:51.653
All right?

911
01:00:51.736 --> 01:00:55.532
- More shopping?
- Mm-hm.

912
01:00:55.657 --> 01:00:59.703
I'm surprised you didn't buy
more than one dress yesterday.

913
01:00:59.828 --> 01:01:02.038
It wasn't as much fun
as I thought it'd be.

914
01:01:02.164 --> 01:01:05.500
- Why not?
- They were mean to me.

915
01:01:06.376 --> 01:01:08.962
Mean to you?

916
01:01:11.047 --> 01:01:12.883
People are looking at me.

917
01:01:13.049 --> 01:01:15.677
They're not looking at you.
They're looking at me.

918
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.180
Stores are not nice to people.
I don't like it.

919
01:01:18.263 --> 01:01:21.558
Stores are never nice to people.
They're nice to credit cards.

920
01:01:23.018 --> 01:01:25.645
OK. Stop fidgeting.

921
01:01:25.729 --> 01:01:27.272
Get rid of your gum.

922
01:01:29.733 --> 01:01:31.776
I don't believe you did that.

923
01:01:34.112 --> 01:01:37.616
I am Mr Hollister, the manager.
May I help you?

924
01:01:37.699 --> 01:01:39.701
- Edward Lewis.
- Yes, sir.

925
01:01:39.784 --> 01:01:43.455
- You see this young lady over there?
- Yes.

926
01:01:43.538 --> 01:01:46.458
Do you have anything in this shop
as beautiful as she is?

927
01:01:46.541 --> 01:01:48.210
Oh, yes.

928
01:01:48.293 --> 01:01:49.753
Oh, no.
No, no.

929
01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:52.589
I'm saying we have many things
as beautiful as she...

930
01:01:52.714 --> 01:01:54.758
...would want them.
That's the point.

931
01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:57.010
I think we can all
agree with that.

932
01:01:57.093 --> 01:01:59.012
You know what we're
gonna need here?

933
01:01:59.095 --> 01:02:02.515
We're gonna need more people helping us.
I'll tell you why.

934
01:02:02.599 --> 01:02:06.144
We are going to be spending
an obscene amount of money in here.

935
01:02:06.228 --> 01:02:08.772
We're gonna need a lot
more help sucking up to us,

936
01:02:08.855 --> 01:02:10.690
'cause that's what
we really like.

937
01:02:10.774 --> 01:02:14.486
Sir, if I may say so, you're in
the right store, and the right city.

938
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:16.279
Anything you see here we can do.

939
01:02:16.363 --> 01:02:17.906
- Get ready to have fun.
- OK.

940
01:02:17.989 --> 01:02:20.825
Mary Pat, Mary Kate,
Mary Francis, let's see it.

941
01:02:20.909 --> 01:02:22.869
This is absolutely divine.

942
01:02:22.953 --> 01:02:24.704
Excuse me, sir.

943
01:02:24.788 --> 01:02:28.291
Exactly how obscene an amount
of money were you talking about?

944
01:02:28.375 --> 01:02:30.877
Profane, or really offensive?

945
01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:33.630
- Really offensive.
- I like him so much.

946
01:02:50.605 --> 01:02:52.732
Mr Lewis, sir.
How's it going so far?

947
01:02:52.816 --> 01:02:56.611
- Pretty well, I think.
- I think we need some major sucking up.

948
01:02:57.362 --> 01:02:59.406
Very well, sir.

949
01:02:59.489 --> 01:03:01.408
You're handsome
and powerful.

950
01:03:01.491 --> 01:03:03.994
I could see you were
someone to reckon with...

951
01:03:04.077 --> 01:03:05.745
- Hollister?
- Yes, sir?

952
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:07.956
Not me. Her.

953
01:03:08.039 --> 01:03:11.001
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.

954
01:03:11.167 --> 01:03:12.460
How are we doing, ladies?

955
01:03:12.544 --> 01:03:15.672
Edward, where are you?
The word's all over the street.

956
01:03:15.797 --> 01:03:18.675
<i>- Morse is gonna raise your offer.</i>
- He's countering?

957
01:03:18.758 --> 01:03:20.844
God, he is a tough old bird.

958
01:03:20.969 --> 01:03:23.638
<i>Contracts are stalled.
Where's he getting money?</i>

959
01:03:23.722 --> 01:03:26.057
I think he's throwing in
with the employees.

960
01:03:26.141 --> 01:03:28.476
He needs someone
to underwrite the paper.

961
01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.270
<i>Find out.
I'll be in in an hour.</i>

962
01:03:30.353 --> 01:03:32.605
- OK. You got it.
- You're on your own.

963
01:03:32.689 --> 01:03:35.275
I have to go back to work.
You look great.

964
01:03:35.358 --> 01:03:38.445
- She has my card.
- And we'll help her use it, sir.

Let's finish this afternoon.

997
01:05:27.303 --> 01:05:29.139
Jake, set something up
with Blair.

998
01:05:29.222 --> 01:05:31.808
2:00, 2:30 would be good.

999
01:05:31.933 --> 01:05:33.685
You were right about Morse.

1000
01:05:33.768 --> 01:05:35.895
He mortgaged everything he owns

1001
01:05:35.979 --> 01:05:38.148
to secure a loan
from the bank.

1002
01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:41.192
And not just any bank.
Plymouth Trust.

1003
01:05:41.317 --> 01:05:43.820
- Mm.
- So, it goes without saying,

1004
01:05:43.903 --> 01:05:46.239
your business means
more to them than Morse.

1005
01:05:46.322 --> 01:05:48.700
All you gotta do
is call the bank.

1006
01:05:52.579 --> 01:05:54.122
Yeah.

1007
01:05:58.376 --> 01:06:00.253
Edward, excuse me
for saying this,

1008
01:06:00.336 --> 01:06:02.464
but what is wrong
with you this week?

1009
01:06:02.547 --> 01:06:05.967
Are you giving Morse
a chance to get away?

1010
01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:09.262
You know what I used to love
when I was a kid, Phil?

1011
01:06:11.389 --> 01:06:13.725
What?

1012
01:06:13.808 --> 01:06:15.351
Blocks.

1013
01:06:17.228 --> 01:06:19.647
Building blocks.
Erector sets.

1014
01:06:19.731 --> 01:06:22.609
So, I liked Monopoly.
Boardwalk, Park Place...

1015
01:06:22.692 --> 01:06:25.778
- What's the point?
- We don't build anything.

1016
01:06:25.862 --> 01:06:27.780
We don't make anything.

1017
01:06:27.864 --> 01:06:30.658
We make money, Edward.

1018
01:06:30.742 --> 01:06:33.870
We worked for a year on this.
It's what you said you wanted.

1019
01:06:33.953 --> 01:06:35.205
I'm handing it to you.

1020
01:06:36.372 --> 01:06:38.708
Morse's jugular is exposed.

1021
01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:42.086
It's time for the kill.
Let's finish this.

1022
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:44.839
Call the bank.

1023
01:07:05.527 --> 01:07:07.737
How was your day, dear?

1024
01:07:11.074 --> 01:07:13.243
Nice tie.

1025
01:07:13.326 --> 01:07:15.453
I got it for you.

1026
01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.083
Well, my mother
was a music teacher...

1027
01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:22.460
...and married my father,

1028
01:07:22.544 --> 01:07:25.213
whose family was
extremely wealthy.

1029
01:07:25.296 --> 01:07:28.258
Then he divorced my mother
to be with another woman.

1030
01:07:29.342 --> 01:07:31.302
And he took his money with him.

1031
01:07:32.929 --> 01:07:35.223
And then she died.

1032
01:07:35.306 --> 01:07:37.433
I was very angry with him.

1033
01:07:37.517 --> 01:07:40.353
It cost me $10,000 in therapy
to say that sentence:

1034
01:07:40.436 --> 01:07:42.105
"I was very angry with him."

1035
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.899
I do it well, don't I?
I'll say it again. I was angry.

1036
01:07:44.983 --> 01:07:48.278
Hello, my name is Mr Lewis.
I am very angry with my father.

1037
01:07:48.361 --> 01:07:50.947
I would've been angry
at the $10,000.

1038
01:07:52.782 --> 01:07:55.868
My father was president

1039
01:07:55.952 --> 01:07:59.747
of the third company
I ever took over.

1040
01:07:59.831 --> 01:08:03.793
I bought it. I sold it off,
piece by piece.

1041
01:08:03.876 --> 01:08:06.004
What did the shrink say?

1042
01:08:06.087 --> 01:08:07.839
Said I was cured.

1043
01:08:07.922 --> 01:08:11.092
Well, so you got even.
That must've made you happy.

1044
01:08:16.889 --> 01:08:20.935
Did I mention my leg
is 44 inches from hip to toe?

1045
01:08:21.019 --> 01:08:23.313
So basically,
we're talking about

1046
01:08:23.396 --> 01:08:26.899
88 inches of therapy

1047
01:08:26.983 --> 01:08:29.819
wrapped around you
for the bargain price...

1048
01:08:29.902 --> 01:08:32.780
- ...of $3,000.
- $3,000.

1049
01:08:32.864 --> 01:08:34.866
Yeah.

1050
01:08:37.702 --> 01:08:40.288
<i>Garbers passes to Keenan.</i>

1051
01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:41.664
<i>This is Phil Fricker</i>

1052
01:08:41.748 --> 01:08:44.000
<i>giving you play-by-play
of this event.</i>

1053
01:08:44.125 --> 01:08:47.837
Watch where you walk, if you step
in something, we're not going back.

1054
01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.798
And not near the tree.
I don't like the ants. Hello.

1055
01:08:50.882 --> 01:08:53.426
Have you seen Edward anywhere?

1056
01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:55.928
- What if someone recognises me?
- Not likely.

1057
01:08:56.012 --> 01:08:58.848
They don't spend time
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1058
01:08:58.931 --> 01:09:00.850
Come on.
Let go. Let go.

1059
01:09:00.933 --> 01:09:04.145
All right. You look great.
You look like a lady.

1060
01:09:04.228 --> 01:09:06.022
We're gonna have
a wonderful time.

1061
01:09:07.857 --> 01:09:11.361
OK, don't fidget.
And smile.

1062
01:09:11.444 --> 01:09:14.364
<i>...coming around the side.</i>

1063
01:09:14.447 --> 01:09:15.990
<i>Penalty on that play.</i>

1064
01:09:16.074 --> 01:09:19.452
This is Gwen and Gretchen,
the infamous Olsen sisters,

1065
01:09:19.535 --> 01:09:21.871
who have made marrying well
an art form.

1066
01:09:21.954 --> 01:09:23.873
- Edward.
- Wait just a sec.

1067
01:09:23.998 --> 01:09:27.043
So, you're the flavour
of the month.

1068
01:09:27.126 --> 01:09:29.379
Uh, she's just being testy.

1069
01:09:29.462 --> 01:09:31.673
Edward's our most
eligible bachelor.

1070
01:09:31.756 --> 01:09:34.509
- Everybody is trying to land him.
- I'm not trying to.

1071
01:09:34.592 --> 01:09:36.719
I'm just using him for sex.

1072
01:09:41.391 --> 01:09:43.893
- Well done.
- Well done!

1073
01:09:43.976 --> 01:09:45.311
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

1074
01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:49.732
Tell me again
why we're here.

1075
01:09:49.816 --> 01:09:51.901
- Business.
- Business mingling?

1076
01:09:51.984 --> 01:09:54.737
Yeah.

1077
01:09:54.821 --> 01:09:58.908
<i>That's the chukker, ladies and
gentlemen. Falcons 7, Gems 4.</i>

1078
01:09:59.033 --> 01:10:01.202
Excuse me. Edward! Edward.

1079
01:10:01.285 --> 01:10:03.830
-Over here.
-Phil.

1080
01:10:03.913 --> 01:10:07.166
- Good to see you.
- I want you to meet a friend, Vivian.

1081
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:09.794
Hi. Philip Stuckey.
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

1082
01:10:09.877 --> 01:10:12.880
It's always a pleasure
meeting one of Edward's girls.

1083
01:10:12.964 --> 01:10:15.383
Oh, my God.
It's Tate Whitley Wallington.

1084
01:10:15.466 --> 01:10:19.887
Tate. It's me, Elizabeth,
from Work Out World.

1085
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:22.181
She's a bit
of an aerobics queen.

1086
01:10:22.265 --> 01:10:24.016
Feel the burn.

1087
01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.311
Let me get you a drink.
Vivian, why don't you start with that?

1088
01:10:27.395 --> 01:10:29.856
I'll be right back.
Senator Adams is here.

1089
01:10:29.939 --> 01:10:31.858
Mm-hm. I asked him.

1090
01:10:31.941 --> 01:10:34.944
That is why I have pledged
my eternal love to you.

1091
01:10:36.821 --> 01:10:39.115
Real genuine guy.
Who is he?

1092
01:10:40.324 --> 01:10:42.326
He's my lawyer.
He's all right.

1093
01:10:42.452 --> 01:10:44.537
You could freeze ice
on his wife's ass.

1094
01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:46.414
We'll try that later.

1095
01:10:46.497 --> 01:10:49.917
- Are these people your friends?
- I spend time with them, yeah.

1096
01:10:50.001 --> 01:10:51.878
Well, no wonder.

1097
01:10:51.961 --> 01:10:53.671
No wonder what?

1098
01:10:53.796 --> 01:10:57.008
No wonder why you
came looking for me.

1099
01:10:57.133 --> 01:11:00.261
I need help from you ladies
and gentlemen in the audience.

1100
01:11:00.344 --> 01:11:03.306
<i>We need help replacing
some divots here on the grass.</i>

1101
01:11:03.473 --> 01:11:05.141
<i>So, come on out now.</i>

1102
01:11:05.224 --> 01:11:06.976
<i>Come on, come on, folks.</i>

1103
01:11:07.059 --> 01:11:09.520
<i>You heard her.
The stomping of the divots.</i>

1104
01:11:09.604 --> 01:11:12.231
<i>This is
a time-honoured tradition.</i>

1105
01:11:12.315 --> 01:11:14.734
<i>As old as the game
of polo itself.</i>

1106
01:11:14.817 --> 01:11:17.236
<i>Kings and queens
used to do this.</i>

1107
01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:21.157
She's sweet, Edward.

1108
01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.534
Wherever did you find her?

1109
01:11:28.623 --> 01:11:30.750
<i>Only one word of advice.</i>

1110
01:11:30.833 --> 01:11:33.878
<i>Avoid the steaming divot.</i>

1111
01:11:40.176 --> 01:11:42.678
It's all part of
the game of polo.

1112
01:11:42.762 --> 01:11:45.306
Your shoes are polished
by a member of the club.

1113
01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:48.142
- I've got something that'll buff that.
- Thank you.

1114
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.980
- Vivian. Hi, David Morse.
- Excuse me.

1115
01:11:54.357 --> 01:11:55.900
- David.
- How are you?

1116
01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:57.777
- I'm OK.
- I thought that was you.

1117
01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.904
- I like this hat.
- It's new.

1118
01:12:00.029 --> 01:12:02.532
Come meet my horse, Vivian.

1119
01:12:02.615 --> 01:12:04.784
Edward's waiting for me.
I don't want...

1120
01:12:04.867 --> 01:12:07.245
- He's right here.
- OK, just for a second.

1121
01:12:07.328 --> 01:12:09.872
I didn't know
you were playing today.

1122
01:12:09.956 --> 01:12:13.292
I was asking for directions.
There she was.

1123
01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:15.628
So, you just ran into her?
That's great.

1124
01:12:15.711 --> 01:12:18.214
So, what does she do?
Does she work?

1125
01:12:20.508 --> 01:12:23.511
- She's in sales.
- That's terrific. That's good.

1126
01:12:23.594 --> 01:12:26.013
What does she sell?

1127
01:12:27.098 --> 01:12:28.683
Why do you want to know?

1128
01:12:30.268 --> 01:12:33.938
Just hear me out on this, OK?
I've known you a long time.

1129
01:12:34.063 --> 01:12:38.150
I see some differences in you
this week, like the tie...

1130
01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:40.653
I'm wondering if this girl
is the difference.

1131
01:12:40.736 --> 01:12:43.322
Especially when I see her
talking to David Morse.

1132
01:12:48.035 --> 01:12:50.288
I introduced them
the other night.

1133
01:12:50.371 --> 01:12:52.164
So now they're best friends?

1134
01:12:52.248 --> 01:12:55.501
This girl appears from nowhere.
Now she's talking to this guy.

1135
01:12:55.585 --> 01:12:58.254
That's a little convenient,
don't you think?

1136
01:12:58.337 --> 01:13:00.923
How do you know she hasn't
attached herself to you

1137
01:13:01.007 --> 01:13:03.092
and is bringing
information to Morse?

1138
01:13:03.175 --> 01:13:05.970
- This happens. Industrial espionage.
- Phil, Phil.

1139
01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:09.140
Listen to me.
She's not a spy.

1140
01:13:09.223 --> 01:13:11.767
She is a hooker.

1141
01:13:11.851 --> 01:13:14.186
She is a hooker.

1142
01:13:15.855 --> 01:13:18.441
I picked her up
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1143
01:13:18.566 --> 01:13:19.942
In your car.

1144
01:13:26.032 --> 01:13:27.617
Yes.

1145
01:13:29.744 --> 01:13:31.996
You're the only millionaire
I've heard of

1146
01:13:32.079 --> 01:13:34.373
who's looking
for a bargain streetwalker.

1147
01:13:34.457 --> 01:13:38.044
- Edward.
- I'm sorry I told you.

1148
01:13:38.127 --> 01:13:41.923
Senator. Senator Adams,
I'm pleased you could make it.

1149
01:13:42.006 --> 01:13:44.467
I hope the information
I gave you was helpful.

1150
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:46.469
Absolutely.

1151
01:13:46.552 --> 01:13:49.096
- No change?
- No, it's still bogged down.

1152
01:13:52.266 --> 01:13:55.978
- Having a nice time, Vivian?
- Yeah, I'm having a great time.

1153
01:13:56.103 --> 01:13:58.814
Must be quite a change
from Hollywood Boulevard.

1154
01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:02.151
What?

1155
01:14:02.234 --> 01:14:04.236
Edward told me.

1156
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.073
Don't worry. Your secret
is safe with me.

1157
01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.785
Listen, maybe...

1158
01:14:10.868 --> 01:14:14.664
...you and I could get together
sometime after Edward leaves.

1159
01:14:16.207 --> 01:14:17.708
Yeah, sure.

1160
01:14:17.792 --> 01:14:19.460
Why not?

1161
01:14:19.543 --> 01:14:22.004
We'll just have to do that, hmm?

1162
01:14:22.171 --> 01:14:23.798
Philip.

1163
01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:30.596
<i>I'd like to mention
a couple of our silver sponsors,</i>

1164
01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.432
<i>Jacobs Distributors,
Norell Saddlery,</i>

1165
01:14:33.516 --> 01:14:36.686
<i>and we'd like to give a big thanks
to our platinum sponsor,</i>

1166
01:14:36.769 --> 01:14:39.647
<i>Edward Lewis Enterprises.</i>

1167
01:14:41.232 --> 01:14:43.943
<i>The ball is in
for chukker number four.</i>

1168
01:14:48.197 --> 01:14:50.032
Ai ..

1169
01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:54.996
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1170
01:14:55.079 --> 01:14:56.789
Fine? That's good.

1171
01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:59.417
Seven "fines" since
we left the match.

1172
01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.335
Could I have
another word, please?

1173
01:15:01.419 --> 01:15:03.546
Asshole. There's a word.

1174
01:15:04.714 --> 01:15:06.716
I think I liked "fine" better.

1175
01:15:06.799 --> 01:15:08.676
Just tell me one thing.

1176
01:15:08.759 --> 01:15:11.053
Why'd you make me
get all dressed up?

1177
01:15:11.137 --> 01:15:13.556
For one thing,
the clothing was appropriate.

1178
01:15:13.639 --> 01:15:17.560
No. What I mean is, if you were gonna
tell everybody I'm a hooker,

1179
01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:20.354
- why didn't you let me wear my clothes?
- I did not...

1180
01:15:20.438 --> 01:15:23.524
In my own clothes, when someone
like Stuckey comes up to me,

1181
01:15:23.607 --> 01:15:26.110
I can handle it,
I'm prepared.

1182
01:15:26.193 --> 01:15:29.113
I'm very sorry. I'm not happy
with Stuckey at all

1183
01:15:29.196 --> 01:15:31.115
for saying that or doing that.

1184
01:15:31.198 --> 01:15:33.909
But he is my attorney.
I've known him for ten years.

1185
01:15:33.993 --> 01:15:37.246
He thought you were an industrial spy.
The guy's paranoid.

1186
01:15:37.329 --> 01:15:39.081
Are you my pimp now?

1187
01:15:39.165 --> 01:15:42.460
You think you can pass me around
your friends? I'm not some toy.

1188
01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:44.587
You're not my toy.
I know you're not...

1189
01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:47.882
Vivian! Vivian, I'm speaking
to you. Come back here.

1190
01:15:47.965 --> 01:15:50.760
I hate to point out the obvious,
but you are a hooker.

1191
01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:53.471
- You are my employee.
- You don't own me. I decide.

1192
01:15:53.596 --> 01:15:56.348
I say who, I say when,
I say who!

1193
01:15:56.432 --> 01:15:59.018
I refuse to spend the next days
fighting with you.

1194
01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:00.436
I said I was sorry.

1195
01:16:00.519 --> 01:16:02.313
That's the end of it.

1196
01:16:03.522 --> 01:16:05.232
I'm sorry I ever met you.

1197
01:16:06.859 --> 01:16:08.819
I'm sorry
I got into your stupid car.

1198
01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:12.031
As if you had so many more
appealing options.

1199
01:16:13.783 --> 01:16:18.454
I've never had anyone make me
feel as cheap as you did today.

1200
01:16:18.537 --> 01:16:21.582
Somehow I find that
very hard to believe.

1201
01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:31.342
Where are you going?

1202
01:16:31.425 --> 01:16:33.677
I want my money.
I want to get out of here.

1203
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:22.852
Come on.

1204
01:17:34.655 --> 01:17:36.407
I'm sorry.

1205
01:17:38.367 --> 01:17:42.496
I wasn't prepared to answer
questions about us.

1206
01:17:44.498 --> 01:17:47.293
That was stupid and cruel.

1207
01:17:48.377 --> 01:17:49.962
I didn't mean it.

1208
01:17:51.046 --> 01:17:53.257
I don't want you to go.

1209
01:17:53.382 --> 01:17:55.342
Will you stay the week?

1210
01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:57.303
Why?

1211
01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:01.724
I saw you talking
to David Morse.

1212
01:18:02.725 --> 01:18:04.310
I didn't like it.

1213
01:18:04.393 --> 01:18:06.854
We were just talking.

1214
01:18:10.232 --> 01:18:12.359
I didn't like it.

1215
01:18:15.196 --> 01:18:16.572
Down?

1216
01:18:29.668 --> 01:18:31.462
You hurt me.

1217
01:18:33.088 --> 01:18:34.757
Yes.

1218
01:18:36.091 --> 01:18:38.552
Don't do it again.

1219
01:19:00.449 --> 01:19:04.370
The first guy I ever loved
was a total nothing.

1220
01:19:04.453 --> 01:19:06.497
The second was worse.

1221
01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:08.666
My mom called me
a "bum magnet.”

1222
01:19:08.749 --> 01:19:10.542
If there was a bum
within 50 miles,

1223
01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:13.087
I was completely attracted to him.

1224
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:16.757
That's how I ended up here.
I followed bum number three.

1225
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.801
Mm.

1226
01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:21.595
So, here I was.
No money, no friends.

1227
01:19:21.679 --> 01:19:23.430
No bum.

1228
01:19:26.558 --> 01:19:30.354
And you chose this
as your profession?

1229
01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:32.856
I worked at a couple
of fast food places.

1230
01:19:33.482 --> 01:19:36.360
Parked cars at wrestling.

1231
01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:40.155
I couldn't make the rent.
I was too ashamed to go home.

1232
01:19:40.656 --> 01:19:42.825
That's when I met Kit.

1233
01:19:42.908 --> 01:19:46.704
She was a hooker
and made it sound so great.

1234
01:19:46.787 --> 01:19:48.872
So one day I did it.

1235
01:19:50.499 --> 01:19:52.793
And I cried
the whole time.

1236
01:19:55.379 --> 01:19:57.298
But then I got
some regulars, and...

1237
01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:59.675
You know, it's not like
anybody plans this.

1238
01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:02.845
It's not... your childhood dream.

1239
01:20:06.015 --> 01:20:08.434
You could be so much more.

1240
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.648
People put you down enough,
you start to believe it.

1241
01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:20.738
I think you are very bright.

1242
01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:24.116
A very special woman.

1243
01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:28.203
The bad stuff is easier to believe.

1244
01:20:28.287 --> 01:20:30.914
You ever notice that?

1245
01:20:39.882 --> 01:20:43.052
I don't want to talk to him.
I'll call him Monday.

1246
01:20:43.135 --> 01:20:45.054
- Did he sign this?
- He had to leave.

1247
01:20:45.137 --> 01:20:47.514
You can't disappear now.
We're in too deep.

1248
01:20:47.598 --> 01:20:50.934
Don't panic. Morse isn't
going anywhere. I'll be back.

1249
01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:53.395
- Did you send the tickets to the hotel?
- Yes.

1250
01:20:53.479 --> 01:20:55.481
- Where are you going?
- I have a date.

1251
01:20:55.564 --> 01:20:57.399
With the hooker?

1252
01:21:01.362 --> 01:21:03.072
Be careful, Philip.

1253
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:26.553
- Do I look OK?
- Mm.

1254
01:21:26.637 --> 01:21:29.723
- "Mm"?
- Something's missing.

1255
01:21:29.807 --> 01:21:33.227
Well, nothin' else is gonna fit
into this dress, I'll tell you.

1256
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:35.521
Maybe something
in this box.

1257
01:21:35.604 --> 01:21:38.565
I don't want you to get
too excited. It's only on loan.

1258
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:50.452
They let you borrow this
from the jewellery store?

1259
01:21:50.536 --> 01:21:53.497
I'm a very good customer.

1260
01:21:53.622 --> 01:21:55.833
To buy this,
how much would it cost?

1261
01:21:55.958 --> 01:21:57.501
A quarter of a million.

1262
01:21:58.836 --> 01:22:00.838
A quarter of a million dollars?

1263
01:22:06.635 --> 01:22:08.554
So where are we going?

1264
01:22:08.637 --> 01:22:10.722
It's a surprise.

1265
01:22:13.183 --> 01:22:15.352
If I forget
to tell you later,

1266
01:22:15.477 --> 01:22:18.313
I had a really good time tonight.

1267
01:22:18.397 --> 01:22:19.815
Thank you.

1268
01:22:39.501 --> 01:22:42.045
When you're not fidgeting,
you look beautiful.

1269
01:22:42.129 --> 01:22:44.298
And very tall.

I've never been on a plane.

1278
01:23:11.033 --> 01:23:13.035

- Bus.

<i>We should be there

1286
01:23:45.901 --> 01:23:49.112
- We're late.
- No, it's all right.

1287
01:23:49.238 --> 01:23:51.823
- Opening night never starts on time.
- OK.

1288
01:23:53.408 --> 01:23:55.494
- Program, sir.
- Thank you.

1289
01:24:04.753 --> 01:24:07.089
Right this way,
Mr Lewis.

1290
01:24:11.385 --> 01:24:14.012
- Doris. Nice to see you.
- How are you, Edward?

1291
01:24:14.096 --> 01:24:15.639
- Sir.
- Evening, Edward.

1292
01:24:15.722 --> 01:24:18.016
- Congratulations.
- Come here and look.

1293
01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:20.269
It's all right.
I've already seen it.

1294
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.689
If you're afraid,
why do you sit up here?

1295
01:24:23.772 --> 01:24:25.649
Because they're the best.

1296
01:24:25.774 --> 01:24:28.402
- Is there anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

1297
01:24:28.485 --> 01:24:30.779
The glasses are there.
Enjoy the opera.

1298
01:24:32.322 --> 01:24:35.492
- So, you said this is in Italian.
- Mm-hm.

1299
01:24:35.617 --> 01:24:38.620
How am I gonna know what they're saying?
These are broken.

1300
01:24:38.745 --> 01:24:41.164
- Mine are broken.
- That's OK. It's all right.

1301
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:46.044
- Oh.
- You'll know. You'll understand.

1302
01:24:46.128 --> 01:24:47.629
The music's very powerful.

1303
01:24:50.465 --> 01:24:52.301
There's a band.

1304
01:24:55.137 --> 01:24:56.763
People's reaction to opera

1305
01:24:56.847 --> 01:24:59.057
the first time they see it
is dramatic.

1306
01:24:59.141 --> 01:25:01.602
They either love it
or they hate it.

1307
01:25:01.685 --> 01:25:05.230
If they love it, they will
always love it. If they don't...

1308
01:25:05.314 --> 01:25:07.608
...they may learn
to appreciate it,

1309
01:25:07.691 --> 01:25:11.695
but it will never become
part of their soul.

1310
01:25:11.778 --> 01:25:14.114
Mm.

1311
01:26:55.799 --> 01:26:58.468
Bravo! Bravo!

1312
01:27:07.352 --> 01:27:09.604
Did you enjoy the opera, dear?

1313
01:27:09.688 --> 01:27:12.274
Oh, it was so good
I almost peed my pants.

1314
01:27:12.607 --> 01:27:13.692
What?

1315
01:27:15.026 --> 01:27:18.572
She said she liked it better
than <i>Pirates of Penzance.</i>

1316
01:27:18.655 --> 01:27:20.157
Oh.

1317
01:27:28.457 --> 01:27:30.292
I moved the queen.

1318
01:27:30.375 --> 01:27:32.711
You can't move the queen.

1319
01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:34.880
Do you really
want to do that?

1320
01:27:36.882 --> 01:27:39.718
Why don't we finish this tomorrow?
I have to work.

1321
01:27:41.678 --> 01:27:44.639
Why don't you not go to work tomorrow?
Take the day off?

1322
01:27:45.974 --> 01:27:47.893
Me not work?

1323
01:27:47.976 --> 01:27:49.644
Yeah.

1324
01:27:52.272 --> 01:27:54.566
I do own the company.

1325
01:28:06.036 --> 01:28:09.748
Here are the storage reports you wanted.
And Mr Lewis called.

1326
01:28:09.831 --> 01:28:11.166
What'd he say?

1327
01:28:11.291 --> 01:28:14.127
He said he's taking the day off.

1328
01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:16.671
- He's taking the day off?
- That's what he said.

1329
01:28:19.966 --> 01:28:21.635
I'm starving.

1330
01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.262
There's a Snap Dog vendor.
Do you have any money?

1331
01:28:24.346 --> 01:28:26.681
I have money.
I don't know what a Snap Dog is.

1332
01:28:26.807 --> 01:28:28.642
I'm gonna...
You'll buy a Snap Dog.

1333
01:28:28.725 --> 01:28:31.102
We'll cop a squat
under a tree somewhere.

1334
01:28:31.186 --> 01:28:33.063
- Cop a what?
- Cop a squat.

1335
01:28:33.188 --> 01:28:35.690
Al right,
read the first two pages.

1336
01:28:35.816 --> 01:28:37.692
OK.

1337
01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.033
I was talking to someone.

1338
01:29:24.489 --> 01:29:26.408
He sleeps.

1339
01:31:56.683 --> 01:31:59.019
I love you.

1340
01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.949
What are you thinking about,
sitting by yourself?

1341
01:32:13.074 --> 01:32:16.036
The fact that this will be
our last night together.

1342
01:32:16.119 --> 01:32:18.580
Then you'll finally
be rid of me.

1343
01:32:18.663 --> 01:32:21.958
Well, you've been
pretty tough to take.

1344
01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:25.045
My business is almost over,
so I'm going back to New York.

1345
01:32:29.758 --> 01:32:31.926
I'd really like
to see you again.

1346
01:32:32.594 --> 01:32:34.345
- You would?
-Yes.

1347
01:32:34.429 --> 01:32:37.599
Yes, I would. I've arranged
for you to have an apartment,

1348
01:32:37.682 --> 01:32:40.643
have a car,
have a wide variety of stores

1349
01:32:40.769 --> 01:32:43.605
that'll suck up to you
anytime you want to go shopping.

1350
01:32:43.688 --> 01:32:46.024
Everything's done.

1351
01:32:46.107 --> 01:32:47.942
What else?

1352
01:32:48.068 --> 01:32:51.112
You gonna leave some money
by the bed when you pass through?

1353
01:32:52.697 --> 01:32:54.491
It really wouldn't be like that.

1354
01:32:54.991 --> 01:32:57.035
How would it be?

1355
01:32:57.118 --> 01:32:59.454
For one thing,
it'd get you off the streets.

1356
01:33:00.205 --> 01:33:02.290
That's just geography.

1357
01:33:12.967 --> 01:33:15.512
Vivian, what is it you want?

1358
01:33:17.889 --> 01:33:22.018
- What do you see happening between us?
- I don't know.

1359
01:33:26.648 --> 01:33:29.400
When I was a little girl,

1360
01:33:29.484 --> 01:33:32.070
my mama used to lock me
in the attic when I was bad,

1361
01:33:32.153 --> 01:33:33.947
which was pretty often.

1362
01:33:34.989 --> 01:33:37.158
And I would...

1363
01:33:37.283 --> 01:33:39.160
I would pretend
I was a princess,

1364
01:33:39.244 --> 01:33:41.996
trapped in a tower
by a wicked queen.

1365
01:33:43.081 --> 01:33:46.584
And then, suddenly, this knight

1366
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:49.337
on a white horse,
with these colours flying,

1367
01:33:49.462 --> 01:33:52.382
would come charging up
and draw his sword,

1368
01:33:52.465 --> 01:33:54.634
and I would wave.

1369
01:33:54.717 --> 01:33:57.345
And he would climb up the tower

1370
01:33:57.428 --> 01:33:59.180
and rescue me.

1371
01:34:02.475 --> 01:34:04.686
But never, in all the time...

1372
01:34:05.895 --> 01:34:08.106
...that I had this dream

1373
01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:09.649
did the knight say to me,

1374
01:34:09.732 --> 01:34:12.443
"Come on, baby. I'll put you up
in a great condo."

1375
01:34:21.953 --> 01:34:23.663
-Yes.
<i>-I had to call.</i>

1376
01:34:23.746 --> 01:34:26.166
I just got off the phone
with Morse. Get this.

1377
01:34:26.249 --> 01:34:28.126
<i>He wants to meet
with you. Today.</i>

1378
01:34:28.251 --> 01:34:29.669
- Why?
<i>- He wouldn't say.</i>

1379
01:34:29.752 --> 01:34:31.838
Edward, his nuts
are on the block.

1380
01:34:31.921 --> 01:34:33.339
We got him.

1381
01:34:33.423 --> 01:34:35.300
<i>He's really caving in.</i>

1382
01:34:35.383 --> 01:34:38.136
<i>I want him to commit his stocks
to us this afternoon.</i>

1383
01:34:38.219 --> 01:34:41.306
It's no good. If he's really caving in,
I don't want to wait.

1384
01:34:41.389 --> 01:34:44.100
Have Morse meet me downtown
this morning. Goodbye.

1385
01:34:52.233 --> 01:34:54.903
I have to go now.

1386
01:34:54.986 --> 01:34:56.905
I want you to understand.

1387
01:34:59.157 --> 01:35:01.034
I heard everything you said.

1388
01:35:02.452 --> 01:35:05.496
This is all
I'm capable of right now.

1389
01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:08.124
It's a very big step for me.

1390
01:35:09.417 --> 01:35:11.002
I know.

1391
01:35:11.085 --> 01:35:13.880
It's a really good offer
for a girl like me.

1392
01:35:15.924 --> 01:35:18.760
I've never treated you
like a prostitute.

1393
01:35:25.099 --> 01:35:27.060
You just did.

1394
01:35:30.271 --> 01:35:32.065
Barnard Thompson, Miss Vivian.

1395
01:35:32.148 --> 01:35:33.983
Could you come to
the front desk?

1396
01:35:34.067 --> 01:35:36.527
Someone here
wants to speak to you.

1397
01:35:36.653 --> 01:35:38.988
- Her name is Miss DE Luca.
- Let me talk to her.

1398
01:35:39.113 --> 01:35:40.949
Let me just talk to her.

1399
01:35:42.659 --> 01:35:44.827
Yo, Viv, babe,
would you come down here?

1400
01:35:44.911 --> 01:35:47.205
The sphincter police
won't let me through.

1401
01:35:47.288 --> 01:35:50.541
- OK. She's on her way.
- Fine.

1402
01:35:50.625 --> 01:35:51.960
- Mr Thompson.
-Yes?

1403
01:35:52.043 --> 01:35:54.837
The window washer
is refusing to come down.

1404
01:35:54.963 --> 01:35:57.882
It's a Saturday.
Wait here, please. Watch her.

1405
01:35:57.966 --> 01:35:59.509
Yes, sir.

1406
01:36:11.062 --> 01:36:15.108
Fifty bucks, grandpa.
For 75, the wife can watch.

1407
01:36:20.154 --> 01:36:21.948
I've been calling you.

1408
01:36:22.031 --> 01:36:24.200
Yeah, they told me
at the Banana.

1409
01:36:24.325 --> 01:36:27.578
- You were supposed to come Tuesday.
- I was hiding from Carlos.

1410
01:36:27.662 --> 01:36:30.206
If you picked up the money,
you wouldn't have to.

1411
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:32.709
I was busy. I had a life.
Nino got beat up.

1412
01:36:32.792 --> 01:36:36.087
I had to visit him in the hospital.
Rachel got arrested.

1413
01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:38.840
Anyway, I got the money.
Thank you for saving my ass.

1414
01:36:38.965 --> 01:36:42.135
Now Carlos can get off it.
He was talking about you last night.

1415
01:36:42.218 --> 01:36:44.887
He would bust something
if he saw you in this outfit.

1416
01:36:44.971 --> 01:36:47.974
I was afraid to hug you.
I might wrinkle you.

1417
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:52.520
You look really good.
No, something with shade.

1418
01:36:54.022 --> 01:36:56.441
You clean up real nice.

1419
01:36:56.524 --> 01:36:59.986
Sure don't fit in on the boulevard,
not that you ever did.

1420
01:37:00.069 --> 01:37:01.446
Well, thanks.

1421
01:37:01.529 --> 01:37:03.573
It's easy to clean up
when you got money.

1422
01:37:03.656 --> 01:37:04.866
Yeah.

1423
01:37:06.659 --> 01:37:10.163
- So, when does he leave?
- Tomorrow.

1424
01:37:11.497 --> 01:37:13.916
- You get to keep the clothes?
- Yeah.

1425
01:37:15.043 --> 01:37:17.420
Edward asked me
if I wanted to see him again.

1426
01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:21.257
But I think, definitely no.

1427
01:37:21.382 --> 01:37:23.843
I mean, it's just
another week, right?

1428
01:37:23.926 --> 01:37:25.678
Definitely no?

1429
01:37:25.803 --> 01:37:27.221
Yeah.

1430
01:37:28.139 --> 01:37:29.515
Oh, no.

1431
01:37:29.599 --> 01:37:31.142
What?

1432
01:37:31.225 --> 01:37:34.145
- I know this weepy look on your face.
- Oh, no, don't.

1433
01:37:34.228 --> 01:37:37.231
- You fell in love with him.
- No. Kit, please stop it.

1434
01:37:37.315 --> 01:37:40.651
You've fallen in love with him?
Did you kiss him? On the mouth?

1435
01:37:40.735 --> 01:37:43.529
- Uh, yeah, I did.
- You kissed him on the mouth?

1436
01:37:43.613 --> 01:37:45.990
- It was nice.
- You fall in love and kiss him?

1437
01:37:46.115 --> 01:37:48.493
- Did I not teach you?
- I'm not stupid.

1438
01:37:48.618 --> 01:37:51.704
I'm... I'm not in love with him.

1439
01:37:51.829 --> 01:37:54.415
I just... I like him.

1440
01:37:55.249 --> 01:37:57.877
- You like him?
- Yeah.

1441
01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.754
You definitely like him?

1442
01:38:01.255 --> 01:38:03.800
Well, he's not a bum.
He's a rich, classy guy.

1443
01:38:03.925 --> 01:38:05.760
Who's gonna break
my heart, right?

1444
01:38:05.843 --> 01:38:07.970
Ohh, no. Come on.
You don't know that.

1445
01:38:08.054 --> 01:38:11.474
Hey, he asked you, right?
Maybe you guys could like...

1446
01:38:11.557 --> 01:38:14.852
...you know, get a house
and buy some diamonds and a horse.

1447
01:38:14.936 --> 01:38:17.939
I don't know.
Anyway, it could work. It happens.

1448
01:38:19.774 --> 01:38:21.818
When does it happen, Kit?

1449
01:38:21.943 --> 01:38:23.945
When? Who does it
really work out for?

1450
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:26.280
Did it work out
for Skinny Marie or Rachel?

1451
01:38:26.406 --> 01:38:28.825
Those were very specific cases
of crackheads.

1452
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:30.993
I just want to know
who it works out for.

1453
01:38:31.077 --> 01:38:32.995
Give me one example
of someone we know

1454
01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:35.415
- that it happened for.
- Name someone?

1455
01:38:35.498 --> 01:38:37.917
- Like, give you a name?
- Yeah, I'd like a name.

1456
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.545
God, the pressure of a name.

1457
01:38:44.924 --> 01:38:46.634
Cinda-fuckin'-rella.

1458
01:38:51.848 --> 01:38:54.642
Mr Morse, you said you wished
to speak to Mr Lewis.

1459
01:38:54.767 --> 01:38:57.061
Mr Lewis is now listening.

1460
01:38:57.145 --> 01:39:00.773
I've reconsidered my position

1461
01:39:00.857 --> 01:39:02.358
on your acquisition offer.

1462
01:39:02.483 --> 01:39:04.485
On one condition:

1463
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:07.196
I'm not so concerned
about me, but...

1464
01:39:07.321 --> 01:39:09.615
...the people who work for me.

1465
01:39:09.699 --> 01:39:11.701
No problem.
They'll be taken care of.

1466
01:39:11.784 --> 01:39:13.995
Now, if we could
address ourselves

1467
01:39:14.078 --> 01:39:16.873
- to the contracts in front of you...
- Excuse me, Phil.

1468
01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:22.211
Gentlemen, I'd like to speak
to Mr Morse alone.

1469
01:39:23.171 --> 01:39:25.173
Thank you.

1470
01:39:27.133 --> 01:39:29.594
You heard the man.
Please wait outside.

1471
01:39:31.554 --> 01:39:32.722
You too, Phil.

1472
01:39:35.308 --> 01:39:36.934
What do you mean?

1473
01:39:37.018 --> 01:39:39.520
I mean, I would like to speak
to Mr Morse alone.

1474
01:39:41.481 --> 01:39:45.067
- Why does he get to stay?
- Please.

1475
01:39:45.151 --> 01:39:47.028
Please.

1476
01:39:49.363 --> 01:39:51.616
I'll be right outside.

1477
01:39:51.699 --> 01:39:53.034
Good.

1478
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:11.719
- Is that better?
- It's all right.

1479
01:40:11.802 --> 01:40:15.598
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Black.

1480
01:40:17.517 --> 01:40:20.978
Mr Morse,

1481
01:40:21.062 --> 01:40:23.731
my interests in your company
have changed.

1482
01:40:25.441 --> 01:40:28.486
What is it you're after now,
Mr Lewis?

1483
01:40:28.569 --> 01:40:32.657
Well, I no longer wish to buy
your company and take it apart.

1484
01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:34.700
I don't want
anyone else to either.

1485
01:40:34.784 --> 01:40:37.912
And it is still
extremely vulnerable.

1486
01:40:38.996 --> 01:40:41.541
So I find myself

1487
01:40:41.624 --> 01:40:44.585
in unfamiliar territory.

1488
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:46.379
I want to help you.

1489
01:40:47.672 --> 01:40:49.257
Why?

1490
01:40:57.682 --> 01:41:00.601
Mr Morse, I think we can
do something very special

1491
01:41:00.685 --> 01:41:02.687
with your company.

1492
01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:04.438
What about our navy contracts?

1493
01:41:05.523 --> 01:41:07.358
Eh, they weren't dead.

1494
01:41:07.441 --> 01:41:09.527
Just delayed.
I bluffed a little bit.

1495
01:41:09.610 --> 01:41:12.822
- You're very good at it.
- Thank you very much. It's my job.

1496
01:41:15.283 --> 01:41:17.868
I think we can leave the details
up to the others.

1497
01:41:17.952 --> 01:41:21.789
I find this hard to say without
sounding condescending, but...

1498
01:41:21.872 --> 01:41:24.542
...I'm proud of you.

1499
01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:28.838
Thank you.

1500
01:41:31.048 --> 01:41:33.426
I think we can let in
the other suits now.

1501
01:41:36.721 --> 01:41:38.472
Let's continue the meeting.

1502
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:42.101
Come in, gentlemen.
Sit down.

1503
01:41:42.184 --> 01:41:44.562
Please, what was this all about?

1504
01:41:45.771 --> 01:41:48.482
It's all yours, Phil.
Finish it up.

1505
01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.738
Hold it.
These aren't signed.

1506
01:41:53.821 --> 01:41:57.658
These aren't signed. Can someone
tell me what the fuck is going on?

1507
01:41:57.783 --> 01:42:01.245
Mr Lewis and I are
going to build ships together.

1508
01:42:01.329 --> 01:42:03.039
Great big ships.

1509
01:42:06.334 --> 01:42:09.462
I think I'm going to go for a walk.
Just stay here awhile.

1510
01:42:09.545 --> 01:42:11.714
Yes, sir, Mr Lewis.

1511
01:42:33.527 --> 01:42:36.322
Well, well.
Hello again.

1512
01:42:36.405 --> 01:42:38.366
I'm looking for Edward.

1513
01:42:38.449 --> 01:42:41.202
Edward's not here.
I thought he was with you.

1514
01:42:41.285 --> 01:42:42.870
No.

1515
01:42:42.995 --> 01:42:46.123
Edward is definitely
not "with me."

1516
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.796
No. If Edward were with me...

1517
01:42:51.879 --> 01:42:53.881
When, actually...

1518
01:42:53.964 --> 01:42:56.801
When Edward was with me,

1519
01:42:56.884 --> 01:43:00.846
he didn't blow off
billion-dollar deals.

1520
01:43:00.930 --> 01:43:05.059
I think that Edward's with you,
that's what I think.

1521
01:43:05.142 --> 01:43:07.436
- Mind if I have a drink?
- No.

1522
01:43:08.396 --> 01:43:10.147
No, thank you.

1523
01:43:11.565 --> 01:43:12.900
Well.

1524
01:43:13.025 --> 01:43:14.652
I'll just wait.

1525
01:43:14.735 --> 01:43:18.906
Uh, Edward will be back soon.
Any minute, he'll be home.

1526
01:43:21.450 --> 01:43:23.661
You know...

1527
01:43:24.537 --> 01:43:26.831
...this is not home.

1528
01:43:26.914 --> 01:43:29.750
This is a hotel room.

1529
01:43:29.834 --> 01:43:32.628
And, uh, you are not...

1530
01:43:32.753 --> 01:43:36.173
...the little woman.

1531
01:43:36.298 --> 01:43:38.134
You're a hooker.

1532
01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:42.263
Maybe you're a very good hooker.

1533
01:43:42.388 --> 01:43:46.183
Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care
about losing millions of dollars.

1534
01:43:46.267 --> 01:43:49.437
Because I have to be very honest
with you right now, Vivian.

1535
01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:51.772
Right now, I really do care.
I really do.

1536
01:43:51.856 --> 01:43:55.776
And right now,
I am really pissed, you know?

1537
01:43:55.901 --> 01:43:58.529
Right now I am just
freaking out.

1538
01:44:00.114 --> 01:44:02.700
So maybe if I screw you...

1539
01:44:02.783 --> 01:44:05.411
...and take you to the opera,
I can be a happy guy.

1540
01:44:05.494 --> 01:44:06.996
Hey! Get off me!

1541
01:44:07.621 --> 01:44:10.499
Goddamn it! Ow!

1542
01:44:10.583 --> 01:44:12.668
- Ow!
- Come on! Come on!

1543
01:44:12.793 --> 01:44:14.795
- I'm gonna...
- Get off me! Get off!

1544
01:44:14.879 --> 01:44:17.423
- Is this 20 bucks? 30 bucks?
- Get off me!

1545
01:44:17.506 --> 01:44:20.634
- You a fifty-dollar whore?
- What are you doing? Get off!

1546
01:44:21.635 --> 01:44:24.513
You want to hurt me?
You already did.

1547
01:44:25.473 --> 01:44:27.141
Get out of here!

1548
01:44:29.059 --> 01:44:31.520
- She's a whore. She's a goddamn...
- Shut up!

1549
01:44:33.981 --> 01:44:36.817
-Oh, damn!
-Shit. Goddamn it.

1550
01:44:38.652 --> 01:44:40.821
- I think you broke my nose.
- Get out.

1551
01:44:40.905 --> 01:44:44.241
What is wrong with you? Come on!
I've been there ten years!

1552
01:44:44.325 --> 01:44:46.410
I devoted my whole life to you!

1553
01:44:46.494 --> 01:44:49.121
That's bullshit.
This is such bullshit.

1554
01:44:49.205 --> 01:44:51.499
It's the kill you love, not me.

1555
01:44:51.582 --> 01:44:54.960
I made you a very rich man
doing exactly what you loved.

1556
01:44:55.044 --> 01:44:57.254
Now, get out of here!

1557
01:44:58.422 --> 01:45:00.508
Get out!

1558
01:45:09.767 --> 01:45:12.019
Why do guys
know how to hit a woman

1559
01:45:12.144 --> 01:45:13.938
right across the cheek, wham,

1560
01:45:14.063 --> 01:45:16.607
and it feels like your eye
is going to explode?

1561
01:45:16.690 --> 01:45:20.277
What do they do? Do they pull you aside
in high school and show you how?

1562
01:45:20.361 --> 01:45:22.530
Is that... Ow!

1563
01:45:22.613 --> 01:45:24.448
Hey.

1564
01:45:26.075 --> 01:45:27.993
Not all guys hit.

1565
01:45:31.539 --> 01:45:34.041
I heard about what you did
with Morse.

1566
01:45:35.543 --> 01:45:37.586
It was a business decision.

1567
01:45:37.711 --> 01:45:40.297
It was good.

1568
01:45:40.381 --> 01:45:41.882
It felt good.

1569
01:45:45.511 --> 01:45:48.347
I think this is OK.

1570
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:50.516
I gotta get going.

1571
01:45:50.599 --> 01:45:53.394
Yes, I noticed you'd packed.

1572
01:45:53.477 --> 01:45:55.396
Why are you leaving now?

1573
01:45:57.731 --> 01:46:00.276
Edward, there'll always
be some guy,

1574
01:46:00.401 --> 01:46:03.904
even some friend of yours,
thinking he can treat me like Stuckey,

1575
01:46:03.988 --> 01:46:06.323
thinking that it's allowed.

1576
01:46:06.407 --> 01:46:08.367
What are you gonna do?

1577
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:10.870
You gonna beat up everybody?

1578
01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:13.956
That's not why you're leaving.

1579
01:46:15.541 --> 01:46:19.420
Look, you made me
a really nice offer.

1580
01:46:19.545 --> 01:46:22.548
And a few months ago,
no problem.

1581
01:46:22.631 --> 01:46:24.425
But now everything
is different.

1582
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:28.554
You changed that,
and you can't change it back.

1583
01:46:29.388 --> 01:46:31.265
I want more.

1584
01:46:32.933 --> 01:46:35.352
I know about wanting more.

1585
01:46:35.477 --> 01:46:37.771
I invented the concept.

1586
01:46:39.607 --> 01:46:42.067
The question is, how much more?

1587
01:46:43.402 --> 01:46:45.571
I want the fairy tale.

1588
01:46:47.448 --> 01:46:50.534
Impossible relationships.

1589
01:46:52.703 --> 01:46:56.749
My special gift
is impossible relationships.

1590
01:47:09.053 --> 01:47:10.930
Thank you.

1591
01:47:11.013 --> 01:47:13.223
You're welcome.

1592
01:47:14.808 --> 01:47:17.186
If you ever need anything...

1593
01:47:17.269 --> 01:47:20.272
...dental floss, whatever,
you give me a call.

1594
01:47:24.401 --> 01:47:26.570
I had a good time.

1595
01:47:26.654 --> 01:47:28.447
Me too.

1596
01:47:39.041 --> 01:47:41.001
You want me
to get you a bellboy?

1597
01:47:41.085 --> 01:47:42.753
No, I got it.

1598
01:47:42.836 --> 01:47:44.421
I'll carry this.

1599
01:47:44.505 --> 01:47:45.923
Thanks.

1600
01:47:53.138 --> 01:47:54.473
Stay.

1601
01:47:54.556 --> 01:47:56.850
Stay the night with me.

1602
01:47:56.934 --> 01:48:00.020
Not because I'm paying you,
but because you want to.

1603
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:06.902
I can't.

1604
01:48:14.118 --> 01:48:15.661
Goodbye.

1605
01:48:22.835 --> 01:48:25.921
I think you have
a lot of special gifts.

1606
01:48:39.768 --> 01:48:42.229
- I didn't do it, sir.
- No, I didn't say that.

1607
01:48:42.354 --> 01:48:44.523
Call maintenance.
Have them deal with it.

1608
01:48:44.606 --> 01:48:46.400
- Delegate authority.
- Yes, sir.

1609
01:48:46.483 --> 01:48:48.235
Hi, Barney.

1610
01:48:49.236 --> 01:48:50.738
Miss Vivian.

1611
01:48:52.031 --> 01:48:53.490
Thank you.

1612
01:48:53.574 --> 01:48:55.576
I wanted to say goodbye.

1613
01:48:55.659 --> 01:48:58.537
Then you're not accompanying
Mr Lewis to New York?

1614
01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:02.082
Come on, Barney. You and me
live in the real world.

1615
01:49:02.166 --> 01:49:03.584
Most of the time.

1616
01:49:04.918 --> 01:49:08.005
- Have you arranged transportation?
- I'm gonna call a cab.

1617
01:49:08.088 --> 01:49:11.300
- Allow me. Darryl.
- Yes, sir.

1618
01:49:11.383 --> 01:49:14.386
Please take Miss Vivian
anywhere she wishes to go.

1619
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:15.971
Yes, sir.

1620
01:49:22.936 --> 01:49:24.688
It's been a pleasure
knowing you.

1621
01:49:24.772 --> 01:49:27.524
Come and visit us
again sometime.

1622
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:30.819
Stay cool.

1623
01:49:43.707 --> 01:49:46.543

Is that everything, sir?

1643
01:51:02.953 --> 01:51:05.581
- Yes, everything.
- I'll meet you downstairs.

1644
01:51:05.706 --> 01:51:08.333
Thank you.

1645
01:51:09.710 --> 01:51:12.504
We look so dopey.

1646
01:51:14.381 --> 01:51:16.884
San Francisco's not that great,
you know.

1647
01:51:17.009 --> 01:51:18.969
It's a bad climate.

1648
01:51:19.052 --> 01:51:20.971
It's foggy.
It's unpredictable.

1649
01:51:21.054 --> 01:51:23.265
I'll wear a sweater.

1650
01:51:23.348 --> 01:51:25.392
What are you
gonna do there?

1651
01:51:25.475 --> 01:51:27.811
Get a job.
Finish high school.

1652
01:51:27.895 --> 01:51:31.481
I got things I can do. I used to make
pretty good grades in high school.

1653
01:51:31.565 --> 01:51:33.609
I can see that about you.
I can see that.

1654
01:51:38.739 --> 01:51:40.991
Sure you won't
come with me?

1655
01:51:41.074 --> 01:51:43.952
And leave all this?
Not in a million.

1656
01:51:45.537 --> 01:51:47.623
Come here.

1657
01:51:51.877 --> 01:51:54.546
Whoa. Whoa.
What is this?

1658
01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:59.384
It's part of the
Edward Lewis Scholarship Fund.

1659
01:51:59.468 --> 01:52:02.262
We think you got a lot
of potential, Kit DE Luca.

1660
01:52:02.387 --> 01:52:04.097
You do?

1661
01:52:05.432 --> 01:52:07.017
You think I got potential?

1662
01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:08.727
Oh, yeah.

1663
01:52:09.061 --> 01:52:11.271
Don't let anybody
tell you different, OK?

1664
01:52:11.939 --> 01:52:13.357
OK.

1665
01:52:14.608 --> 01:52:15.859
Take care of you.

1666
01:52:16.276 --> 01:52:18.528
No, I can't. I can't.
It's your favourite.

1667
01:52:20.489 --> 01:52:22.282
What time's your bus?

1668
01:52:23.158 --> 01:52:24.785
An hour.

1669
01:52:25.494 --> 01:52:28.664
Yeah, well, I gotta split,
"cause goodbyes make me crazy.

1670
01:52:28.789 --> 01:52:31.500
- Take care of you.
- Whoa.

1671
01:52:36.922 --> 01:52:37.965
Mr Lewis.

1672
01:52:38.465 --> 01:52:40.759
You don't have any messages
for me, do you?

1673
01:52:41.385 --> 01:52:43.303
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

1674
01:52:45.847 --> 01:52:47.933
I'll need a car to the airport.

1675
01:52:48.016 --> 01:52:50.560
Darryl will take you
wherever you need to go.

1676
01:52:50.644 --> 01:52:52.813
- The limousine out front.
- Yes, sir.

1677
01:52:52.896 --> 01:52:54.398
Thank you, Darryl.

1678
01:52:57.442 --> 01:53:01.238
One last thing. If you could return this
to Fred's for me, please?

1679
01:53:01.321 --> 01:53:04.491
Yes, of course.
May I, sir?

1680
01:53:05.575 --> 01:53:07.119
Of course. Please.

1681
01:53:14.167 --> 01:53:17.421
It must be difficult to let go
of something so beautiful.

1682
01:53:20.674 --> 01:53:24.177
You know, Darryl also drove
Miss Vivian home yesterday.

1683
01:53:28.807 --> 01:53:30.100
I'll take care of it.

1684
01:53:31.518 --> 01:53:33.687
Thank you, Mr Thompson.

1685
01:53:45.490 --> 01:53:48.368
Your plane
is leaving as scheduled, sir.

1686
01:53:48.493 --> 01:53:50.871
You should be back
in New York on time.

1687
01:54:01.965 --> 01:54:04.718
I'm gonna have to charge you
more rent than Vivian.

1688
01:54:04.843 --> 01:54:07.054
I got this beauty course
I'm looking into,

1689
01:54:07.179 --> 01:54:08.847
and I'm not gonna
be there much.

1690
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:11.391
You know, you just can't
turn tricks forever.

1691
01:54:11.516 --> 01:54:13.769
You gotta have a goal.
Do you have a goal?

1692
01:54:13.894 --> 01:54:16.438
I always wanted
to be in Ice Capades.

1693
01:54:16.521 --> 01:54:18.148
Help you, love?

1694
01:54:18.231 --> 01:54:20.150
Here you go.
Thank you very much.

1695
01:54:20.233 --> 01:54:23.403
-You got a lot of stuff?
-Carlos burned most of my stuff

1696
01:54:23.528 --> 01:54:25.572
when I said
I was moving out.

1697
01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:54.393
Vivian!

1698
01:54:54.476 --> 01:54:56.645
Vivian!

1699
01:55:01.108 --> 01:55:04.444
Princess Vivian!
Come down!

1700
01:55:09.282 --> 01:55:11.868
- It had to be the top floor, right?
- It's the best.

1701
01:55:11.952 --> 01:55:14.746
All right. I'm coming up.

1702
01:55:49.281 --> 01:55:51.324
So, what happened after

1703
01:55:51.450 --> 01:55:54.411
he climbed up the tower
and rescued her?

1704
01:55:54.494 --> 01:55:57.164
She rescues him right back.

1705
01:56:07.674 --> 01:56:09.509
Welcome to Hollywood.

1706
01:56:09.593 --> 01:56:11.136
What's your dream?

1707
01:56:11.219 --> 01:56:12.929
Everybody comes here.

1708
01:56:13.013 --> 01:56:15.932
This is Hollywood,
the land of dreams.

1709
01:56:16.016 --> 01:56:18.852
Some dreams come true,
some don't.

1710
01:56:18.935 --> 01:56:22.022
But keep on dreamin'.
This is Hollywood.

1711
01:56:22.105 --> 01:56:25.609
<i>Always time to dream,
so keep on dreamin'.</i>
