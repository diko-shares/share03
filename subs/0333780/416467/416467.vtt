1
00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:44.435
Look, her first high-end retail shopping experience.

2
00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.306
Her nanny tried to take her to Baby Gap...

3
00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:48.538
but she'd just cry and cry.

4
00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:51.104
She was a professional shopper at age three.

5
00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:52.444
Oh, wow!

6
00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:54.610
Remember when she was on the cover of "Seventeen"?

7
00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:57.211
She had so much potential back then.

8
00:00:57.288 --> 00:01:00.416
Look at her. She could have been a Playmate by now.

9
00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:03.052
Hello! She's a lawyer.

10
00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:05.619
-That's way better. -Why?

11
00:01:05.697 --> 00:01:07.062
There she is!

12
00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:09.623
You always said she has the perfect shaped head...

13
00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:12.568
for a tiara!

14
00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:15.629
Look at that slime dog!

15
00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:19.404
It was so nice of you to make this for Elle's wedding shower.

16
00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:21.911
I can't scrapbook worth a damn.

17
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.414
I took a class on it at community college.

18
00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:26.211
-She got a "B." -Plus!

19
00:01:28.586 --> 00:01:30.554
The day she passed her LSAT!

20
00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:32.954
I swallowed some of that Silly String.

21
00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:34.355
It wouldn't be the first time.

22
00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:37.952
Look at that. Her first day at Harvard.

23
00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:39.929
Unbelievable. Awesome.

24
00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:43.365
The Bend and Snap!

25
00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:46.164
I love that. I did it last night naked.

26
00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:49.764
-You did not. -Yes. I busted a window.

27
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:53.538
Oh, my God, there's Bruiser's first highlights.

28
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.136
Is this the key to her first office at the firm?

29
00:01:56.214 --> 00:02:00.651
Remember that Caribbean decor? It was genius.

30
00:02:00.718 --> 00:02:05.314
Look, there she is with Congresswoman Rudd...

31
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.291
when they started the Harvard alumni women's event.

32
00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.953
-Yeah. -That's two kick-ass women.

33
00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:14.123
I like them. I really like them.

34
00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:18.832
The first day they met! Emmett loves her already.

35
00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:20.996
You can see it in his eyes.

36
00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:22.198
Emmett and Elle.

37
00:02:22.273 --> 00:02:26.334
They're truly Romeo and Juliet without the dying.

38
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:27.708
Paulette?

39
00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.974
Oh, my God! Girls, I think it's her.

40
00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:32.482
-Quick! Lights out! -OK!

41
00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:38.014
Paulette?

42
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.525
I thought we were supposed to be at the movies by 9:00.

43
00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:44.562
Surprise!

44
00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:52.899
We got her!

45
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.303
Oh, my God! Margot, Serena, I cannot believe...

46
00:02:55.373 --> 00:02:57.034
you guys flew all the way here!

47
00:02:57.108 --> 00:02:59.508
-No biggie. -On the contrary.

48
00:02:59.577 --> 00:03:01.511
It's a huge biggie. Thank you.

49
00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.342
You guys are the best.

50
00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:07.544
Speaking of biggies, can we see your ring again?

51
00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.952
Not your Delta Nu ring, Elle.

52
00:03:11.022 --> 00:03:13.684
You mean, this one?

53
00:03:15.893 --> 00:03:19.226
Clarity between F.L. and V.V.S. Nice girdle diameter.

54
00:03:19.297 --> 00:03:21.731
Cut impeccable. It's a keeper.

55
00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.029
Thanks!

56
00:03:24.102 --> 00:03:26.969
Oh, my gosh, it's from Emmett!

57
00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:30.235
That's me and Emmett on Fenway baseball field.

58
00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:31.969
It's his favorite place in the whole world.

59
00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:35.171
I love snow globes.

60
00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:38.612
I can hear the ocean.

61
00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:41.618
Listen, honey, you're a full-time bride now...

62
00:03:41.686 --> 00:03:43.483
so you'll need a whole new wardrobe.

63
00:03:43.554 --> 00:03:46.785
I'm not quitting my job, you guys.

64
00:03:46.858 --> 00:03:48.917
Do you guys remember that feeling we used to get...

65
00:03:48.993 --> 00:03:51.120
during a really intense Spinning class?

66
00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:55.393
That we feel so truly amazing about ourselves?

67
00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:58.162
That's how I feel being a lawyer. I love it.

68
00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:01.228
I have this huge annual review coming up...

69
00:04:01.306 --> 00:04:03.501
so keep 'em crossed, girls.

70
00:04:03.574 --> 00:04:05.098
Crossed!

71
00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:09.306
Congratulations, you did it.

72
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.339
With three wrong answers, you've managed to undermine...

73
00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:17.684
the entire foundation upon which our legal system's built.

74
00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:21.122
And by the way...

75
00:04:21.192 --> 00:04:23.717
it only took me two wrong answers.

76
00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:35.931
Sweetie, you customized my ring? Again?

77
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:38.771
Emmett, you are never going to believe my news!

78
00:04:38.843 --> 00:04:40.970
-What? -Fenway Park!

79
00:04:41.045 --> 00:04:44.037
You, me, two rings, and one recently ordained umpire...

80
00:04:44.115 --> 00:04:45.343
right on the entry field!

81
00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:47.441
Infield. What are you talking about?

82
00:04:47.518 --> 00:04:49.816
It turns out the starting pitcher for the Red Sox...

83
00:04:49.887 --> 00:04:52.014
has an unfortunate unibrow problem.

84
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.149
He goes to Nadia, my waxer...

85
00:04:54.225 --> 00:04:56.056
so the team pulled some strings with the site manager...

86
00:04:56.127 --> 00:04:57.788
and we're getting married at Fenway!

87
00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:00.353
Are you serious?

88
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:03.662
Are you sure this is what you want to do?

89
00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:07.398
I can married anywhere and it wouldn't matter.

90
00:05:07.472 --> 00:05:09.303
That's a lie.

91
00:05:09.374 --> 00:05:14.073
I'm getting married under the Green Monster!

92
00:05:14.145 --> 00:05:16.136
Yes!

93
00:05:16.214 --> 00:05:18.182
And in just three months and four days!

94
00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:20.513
Emmett, we have so much to talk about.

95
00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:23.554
I want everybody who matters to us to be there.

96
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.254
Oh, my God! I almost forgot!

97
00:05:29.994 --> 00:05:30.928
You want me to what?

98
00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:32.259
You want me to what?

99
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.890
A biological birth parent search.

100
00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:36.831
For your dog.

101
00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:40.268
For my Chihuahua-American Bruiser Woods.

102
00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:43.933
I found him abandoned years ago.

103
00:05:44.008 --> 00:05:47.739
Miss, I'm the highest-paid, most sought after...

104
00:05:47.812 --> 00:05:50.872
private investigator in the greater Boston area.

105
00:05:50.948 --> 00:05:52.575
That's precisely why we came to you, Detective.

106
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.347
It is absolutely vital that we find Bruiser's mother pronto.

107
00:05:56.421 --> 00:06:00.687
His father might be more difficult. You know dogs.

108
00:06:00.758 --> 00:06:02.123
May I ask why?

109
00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:04.127
Of course. "Martha Stewart Weddings"...

110
00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:07.062
recommends a 4 to 6-week window for RSVPs...

111
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:09.656
and I can't send the invitation without an address.

112
00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:13.101
And the sooner I get started on the calligraphy the better.

113
00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:16.106
You want to send an invitation to your wedding...

114
00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:18.734
to your dog's mother. And you're serious?

115
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.141
Detective, if I have to make room...

116
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:22.145
for my second cousin's vegan diet coach...

117
00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:23.942
you better believe I'll make room for the mother...

118
00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:26.711
of the one loving creature who's always been there for me.

119
00:06:26.784 --> 00:06:29.912
In fact, I can't believe I haven't done this sooner!

120
00:06:29.987 --> 00:06:32.751
I'm thinking the same thing.

121
00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:41.795
-Elle! -Hi, Mr. Blaine.

122
00:06:41.866 --> 00:06:44.130
-The client is thrilled. -Good!

123
00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:46.602
How you seamlessly negotiated that deal?

124
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:50.107
-lt was simply magnifique. -Thank you.

125
00:06:50.174 --> 00:06:51.402
Big staff meeting today, kiddo.

126
00:06:51.476 --> 00:06:55.037
All right. I got my fingers crossed.

127
00:06:55.112 --> 00:06:57.546
Milton, two shots, extra foam.

128
00:06:57.615 --> 00:07:00.277
-Wow. Thanks, E.W. -No problem!

129
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:02.615
-Go get 'em today. -Thanks.

130
00:07:02.687 --> 00:07:04.655
Soy for you, honey. No dairy.

131
00:07:04.722 --> 00:07:06.553
That's right. Thank you. Your call list is endless.

132
00:07:06.624 --> 00:07:08.592
-lt is? -We better get right on it.

133
00:07:10.127 --> 00:07:12.618
Kevin, you shouldn't have!

134
00:07:12.697 --> 00:07:15.165
I'm not sure they're giving me the promotion today.

135
00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:17.167
It's just a widespread yet credible rumor.

136
00:07:17.235 --> 00:07:19.760
It's from me and the girls.

137
00:07:19.837 --> 00:07:21.532
Oh, right!

138
00:07:23.674 --> 00:07:25.198
Now do me.

139
00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:30.843
I feel like the luckiest girl in the world.

140
00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:32.644
-Me, too! -You do?

141
00:07:32.717 --> 00:07:34.776
I had no idea I could be this happy...

142
00:07:34.852 --> 00:07:37.719
without accruing credit card debt.

143
00:07:37.788 --> 00:07:39.551
Already?

144
00:07:39.624 --> 00:07:42.991
Well, Miss Woods, even the weird ones get cracked.

145
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.824
-You ready? -Yes!

146
00:07:48.132 --> 00:07:50.726
Bruiser Woods...

147
00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:53.326
meet your mom.

148
00:07:53.404 --> 00:07:56.202
Bruiser...your cheekbones.

149
00:07:58.142 --> 00:07:59.575
And it's all in there.

150
00:07:59.644 --> 00:08:02.112
Good luck finding whatever it is you're looking for.

151
00:08:03.848 --> 00:08:07.306
Oh, my God! She's a Bostonian!

152
00:08:09.954 --> 00:08:13.082
Bruiser, we're here!

153
00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:14.988
As your adoptive mother, I'm sure you're nervous...

154
00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:16.492
about meeting your birth mother...

155
00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:21.123
but hear her out, OK? I'm sure she had her reasons.

156
00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:23.598
Bruiser, your mother lives at...

157
00:08:23.668 --> 00:08:25.397
the top secret Versace think-tank!

158
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:27.528
I told you they had one!

159
00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:28.731
No, ma'am.

160
00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:31.036
Unless you have a pass, you cannot go up there.

161
00:08:31.108 --> 00:08:33.042
Lucky I always keep it on me.

162
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.511
Hold on. It's right here.

163
00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:38.242
There you go.

164
00:08:38.316 --> 00:08:40.375
What is it?

165
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:42.078
It's my double platinum V.V.I.P. Versace...

166
00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:44.212
Preferred Customer identification card.

167
00:08:44.288 --> 00:08:47.519
Available only to those that've shopped on five continents.

168
00:08:47.592 --> 00:08:49.423
If that fails to satisfy you, you can also contact...

169
00:08:49.493 --> 00:08:52.053
Billy Dailey, head of customer relations.

170
00:08:52.129 --> 00:08:53.460
You got the wrong VERSACE, lady.

171
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:55.692
Really? Donatella's not here?

172
00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:57.063
Bruiser, where are you going?

173
00:08:57.134 --> 00:08:59.227
Bruiser!

174
00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:00.600
Ma'am!

175
00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:04.635
Bruiser?

176
00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:07.177
Get back here!

177
00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:09.303
Where are you going?

178
00:09:11.682 --> 00:09:15.243
Bruiser, I didn't know you were so athletic.

179
00:09:20.725 --> 00:09:23.694
What is it?

180
00:09:28.833 --> 00:09:30.130
Oh, my God!

181
00:09:34.238 --> 00:09:37.139
You, come here!

182
00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:40.302
Come on! Open this door immediately!

183
00:09:40.378 --> 00:09:41.572
What are you doing here?

184
00:09:41.646 --> 00:09:46.345
You have my dog's mom, and I need her right now!

185
00:09:46.417 --> 00:09:48.442
Absolutely not. I'm not authorized to release...

186
00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:50.487
any subjects from their containment units.

187
00:09:50.554 --> 00:09:53.455
I'm not even allowed to have a key.

188
00:09:53.524 --> 00:09:55.549
Swallow the thing one time, and all of a sudden...

189
00:09:55.626 --> 00:09:58.527
you're the weird key swallower who can't be trusted.

190
00:09:59.997 --> 00:10:02.591
I don't think you're understanding me.

191
00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:04.134
I'm willing to pay for her.

192
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:05.793
These animals aren't for sale, ma'am.

193
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.599
They're the legal property of this facility.

194
00:10:07.672 --> 00:10:10.971
What kind of facility is this?

195
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:16.108
Mr. Livermore, I'm so sorry!

196
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.581
Elle, this VERSACE is a cosmetic testing facility.

197
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.813
-Oh, no! -Bruiser's mom's a test subject.

198
00:10:22.887 --> 00:10:24.718
I want her out of there immediately.

199
00:10:24.789 --> 00:10:26.814
Animal test subjects can only be surrendered...

200
00:10:26.891 --> 00:10:29.223
on a voluntary basis, and they're not volunteering.

201
00:10:29.293 --> 00:10:31.818
After I get through with them, they'll be begging.

202
00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:33.329
And I'm not just taking Bruiser's mom.

203
00:10:33.397 --> 00:10:36.366
I'll bust all those dogs out of that doggie dungeon.

204
00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:38.766
"Research Science and Critter Exploitation"?

205
00:10:38.836 --> 00:10:41.999
This VERSACE's owned by the C'est Magnifique Corporation!

206
00:10:42.073 --> 00:10:43.700
That's fantastic!

207
00:10:43.774 --> 00:10:46.174
Our law firm represents C'est Magnifique.

208
00:10:46.243 --> 00:10:47.870
We can tell them to fix this.

209
00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:50.470
I can't wait to take this to the partners.

210
00:10:50.548 --> 00:10:53.642
But how are you going to convince them?

211
00:10:53.718 --> 00:10:55.686
Presenting...

212
00:10:58.823 --> 00:11:02.919
Abandoned at birth, I was on my own at an early age...

213
00:11:02.993 --> 00:11:07.862
fighting for survival on the streets of Beverly Hills...

214
00:11:07.932 --> 00:11:11.333
making his way down the boulevard of broken dreams,

215
00:11:11.402 --> 00:11:14.735
turning tricks at Hollywood and Vine...

216
00:11:14.805 --> 00:11:17.137
yet even when I found a loving mother...

217
00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:20.609
I couldn't shake this nagging emptiness in my heart.

218
00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:23.306
It was like a void. When I looked in the mirror...

219
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.371
who was it that was looking back at me?

220
00:11:25.449 --> 00:11:27.940
This is Bruiser's question.

221
00:11:28.018 --> 00:11:32.045
And in a way, aren't we all Bruisers?

222
00:11:32.123 --> 00:11:35.388
I think yes. Thank you.

223
00:11:37.795 --> 00:11:40.525
Ms. Woods, this is a law firm...

224
00:11:40.598 --> 00:11:43.396
not an animal rights advocacy group.

225
00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:45.901
We're lawyers. We have to fight for justice.

226
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.904
And this is definitely unjust.

227
00:11:47.972 --> 00:11:51.738
In this case, the cost of beauty is way too high.

228
00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:54.175
I can't believe I said that, but it's true.

229
00:11:54.245 --> 00:11:56.304
What we fight for...

230
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.678
is our clients and their best interests.

231
00:11:58.749 --> 00:12:02.446
But isn't doing the right thing in everybody's best interest?

232
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.512
I think you're confusing the right thing and the law.

233
00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:09.252
You didn't think they were the same, did you?

234
00:12:09.326 --> 00:12:12.386
Why don't we get back to business...

235
00:12:12.463 --> 00:12:14.954
and discuss your very bright future?

236
00:12:15.032 --> 00:12:17.023
Pardon me, I don't mean to interrupt...

237
00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:20.502
but I just-- What you're saying is...

238
00:12:20.571 --> 00:12:23.199
if C'est Magnifique follows the letter of the law...

239
00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:26.710
even if it ends up hurting living beings...

240
00:12:26.777 --> 00:12:30.975
we're just doing our job?

241
00:12:31.048 --> 00:12:34.779
I'm sorry, Mr. Blaine...

242
00:12:34.852 --> 00:12:38.185
I don't think I can work with people who believe that.

243
00:12:40.558 --> 00:12:44.358
You know what? You're right.

244
00:12:44.428 --> 00:12:46.692
Thank you, Mr. Blaine.

245
00:12:46.764 --> 00:12:48.959
You shouldn't have to work with people who believe that.

246
00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:51.092
Absolutely. I knew you would understand.

247
00:12:51.168 --> 00:12:53.432
You're fired, Elle.

248
00:12:53.504 --> 00:12:54.994
What?

249
00:12:55.072 --> 00:12:58.838
We only have room for serious lawyers here.

250
00:12:58.909 --> 00:13:02.777
Take the rest of the day to clear out your things.

251
00:13:02.847 --> 00:13:06.840
But the secretarial pool already gave me a balloon.

252
00:13:06.917 --> 00:13:09.408
Keep the balloon, if you wish.

253
00:13:19.997 --> 00:13:22.465
Please, Emmett, just go away.

254
00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:24.831
Why don't you come on out, sweetie?

255
00:13:24.902 --> 00:13:26.995
I know Bruiser doesn't blame you.

256
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:29.938
But I'm all he has to speak for him in this world...

257
00:13:30.007 --> 00:13:31.474
and I have completely failed him.

258
00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:35.535
You know what I thought the first time I saw you?

259
00:13:35.613 --> 00:13:39.014
"God, that woman wears a lot of pink"?

260
00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:43.281
No. I thought...

261
00:13:43.354 --> 00:13:45.948
"That woman is really special."

262
00:13:46.023 --> 00:13:50.357
"She believes she can make a difference and she will."

263
00:13:50.427 --> 00:13:55.262
So...come on out and let's talk about it.

264
00:13:55.332 --> 00:13:57.357
No.

265
00:13:57.434 --> 00:14:01.234
We could go over some wedding details.

266
00:14:04.108 --> 00:14:06.542
How about that? It revolves.

267
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.907
And it illuminates.

268
00:14:07.978 --> 00:14:10.310
It's even got the Red Sox colors.

269
00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:12.781
That's fantastic, honey!

270
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.011
Speaking of red socks...

271
00:14:15.085 --> 00:14:16.950
you're not getting cold feet, are you?

272
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:18.249
About what?

273
00:14:18.322 --> 00:14:20.950
How's it going to look? A Harvard law professor...

274
00:14:21.025 --> 00:14:23.493
married to a lawyer who got fired from her first job.

275
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.551
Fired for something she believes in.

276
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:27.187
It's going to look like...

277
00:14:27.264 --> 00:14:32.395
"There goes the luckiest guy in the whole world."

278
00:14:33.504 --> 00:14:35.529
Thanks.

279
00:14:43.314 --> 00:14:46.306
Holy crap!

280
00:14:46.383 --> 00:14:50.444
It's gorgeous!

281
00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:52.546
The material keeps falling apart.

282
00:14:52.623 --> 00:14:54.147
No!

283
00:14:54.224 --> 00:14:56.419
Amy, is something wrong?

284
00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:01.154
You can't do a scallop trim on the outer hoop skirt.

285
00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:04.064
The material's too delicate. It'll just fall apart.

286
00:15:04.134 --> 00:15:06.364
But in two out of three home tests it held.

287
00:15:06.437 --> 00:15:08.428
I am so sorry, Elle.

288
00:15:12.876 --> 00:15:15.401
No biggie. I guess I don't need...

289
00:15:15.479 --> 00:15:18.346
a scallop trim on the outer hoop skirt.

290
00:15:18.415 --> 00:15:20.508
I'll be fine.

291
00:15:20.584 --> 00:15:22.518
What is it that you said back when I couldn't...

292
00:15:22.586 --> 00:15:26.420
fit into my white spandex pantsuit for my wedding?

293
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.014
If the fabric doesn't work with you...

294
00:15:28.092 --> 00:15:29.821
don't work with it.

295
00:15:29.893 --> 00:15:31.053
It's one of my favorite mantras.

296
00:15:31.128 --> 00:15:34.529
That is so true, and I know the most perfect organza!

297
00:15:34.598 --> 00:15:37.533
Or something really classy like...

298
00:15:37.601 --> 00:15:40.126
Iike white leather!

299
00:15:40.204 --> 00:15:43.367
I'll call the guy that did my car seats.

300
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.841
Wait...that's it.

301
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.313
Don't fight the fabric. Change it.

302
00:15:51.382 --> 00:15:54.215
OK, but white leather?

303
00:15:55.786 --> 00:15:59.119
If the law is what's keeping Bruiser's mother locked up...

304
00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:01.487
I shouldn't be fighting it, I should be changing it.

305
00:16:01.558 --> 00:16:04.459
Everybody, I'm going to make...

306
00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:06.860
animal testing for cosmetics illegal!

307
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.696
I know that making a dog wear mascara and blush is wrong...

308
00:16:10.768 --> 00:16:12.633
This isn't just about Bruiser's mom anymore...

309
00:16:12.703 --> 00:16:14.261
this is about the fact that every day...

310
00:16:14.338 --> 00:16:16.636
that I put on my Gold Goddess luminescent blush...

311
00:16:16.707 --> 00:16:19.904
some poor little innocent animal might be suffering for it.

312
00:16:19.977 --> 00:16:22.104
You don't realize how horrible something is...

313
00:16:22.179 --> 00:16:23.806
until it happens to you personally.

314
00:16:23.881 --> 00:16:25.678
Like breastfeeding.

315
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:28.479
And if I want to give a voice to Bruiser...

316
00:16:28.552 --> 00:16:30.884
I have to go to the place that gave a voice to the people!

317
00:16:30.954 --> 00:16:35.857
Oh, my God! The headquarters of "Cosmopolitan" magazine!

318
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:40.157
Better! Ladies...

319
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.289
I'm going to Washington!

320
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.826
D.C., here I come!

321
00:16:44.902 --> 00:16:47.370
If anybody can handle this, it's you, honey.

322
00:16:47.438 --> 00:16:50.965
I got a call from the Delta Nu 24-hour housing hotline.

323
00:16:51.041 --> 00:16:52.406
Your apartment's all set.

324
00:16:52.476 --> 00:16:54.808
-Great! -Elle!

325
00:16:56.313 --> 00:17:01.410
Oh, my God! You look like the Fourth of July!

326
00:17:01.485 --> 00:17:04.921
Makes me want a hot dog real bad.

327
00:17:04.988 --> 00:17:08.424
Yeah, OK. You got to get going, honey.

328
00:17:08.492 --> 00:17:09.652
OK.

329
00:17:11.195 --> 00:17:13.129
-Elle, look at this. -What's that?

330
00:17:13.197 --> 00:17:15.165
According to "Animal Fair" magazine...

331
00:17:15.232 --> 00:17:18.099
your new boss is the best groomed woman in Washington.

332
00:17:18.168 --> 00:17:20.568
Her beagle's name is Dolly Madison...

333
00:17:20.637 --> 00:17:24.073
which is my grandma's stripper name.

334
00:17:24.141 --> 00:17:25.904
Isn't that a good sign?

335
00:17:25.976 --> 00:17:27.671
Oh, my gosh. A job with a brilliant congresswoman...

336
00:17:27.744 --> 00:17:29.075
who's also a fellow Harvard alum.

337
00:17:29.146 --> 00:17:32.309
You'll do great, Elle. It's destiny.

338
00:17:32.382 --> 00:17:34.509
But isn't planning the wedding of the century...

339
00:17:34.585 --> 00:17:37.679
and changing the law kind of hard?

340
00:17:37.754 --> 00:17:40.348
Paulette, I taught Bruiser how to shop online.

341
00:17:40.424 --> 00:17:43.393
I think I can handle Congress.

342
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.860
See ya.

343
00:18:23.934 --> 00:18:26.300
Home sweet home. You ready?

344
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.769
OK.

345
00:18:27.838 --> 00:18:29.271
Welcome to the Wellington, ma'am.

346
00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:31.398
It's a thrill to be here!

347
00:18:50.494 --> 00:18:52.485
Time to legislate!

348
00:18:54.698 --> 00:18:56.165
No.

349
00:19:00.037 --> 00:19:02.028
Too Nancy.

350
00:19:02.105 --> 00:19:04.369
Too Hillary.

351
00:19:04.441 --> 00:19:07.239
Too Monica.

352
00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:10.075
Too perfect for words!

353
00:19:15.852 --> 00:19:17.717
Hi!

354
00:19:17.788 --> 00:19:20.552
Good morning, fellow public servants.

355
00:19:20.624 --> 00:19:22.387
It's my first day.

356
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.090
Nice briefcase.

357
00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:30.690
Huh? Thank you.

358
00:19:33.203 --> 00:19:34.864
Hi!

359
00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:43.707
Last item on our agenda--Elle Woods.

360
00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.805
Personal Rudd hire, taking up a bill...

361
00:19:45.882 --> 00:19:48.612
on animal testing in the cosmetic industry.

362
00:19:48.685 --> 00:19:50.414
I'm sorry, Rudd's backing that?

363
00:19:50.487 --> 00:19:51.977
Matter of conscience, whatever.

364
00:19:52.055 --> 00:19:54.785
Who knows? Maybe it'll boost our female demographic.

365
00:19:54.858 --> 00:19:56.758
The point is we're animal lovers now.

366
00:19:56.827 --> 00:20:00.661
If this is so important to Rudd, shouldn't I be handling it?

367
00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:03.564
No, Timothy, not when we have a woman...

368
00:20:03.634 --> 00:20:05.568
who according to Rudd, is one of the shrewdest...

369
00:20:05.636 --> 00:20:07.831
Iegal and political minds of our time.

370
00:20:09.973 --> 00:20:13.306
Hello, patriots!

371
00:20:13.377 --> 00:20:14.844
I don't think I've been this excited...

372
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:17.106
since Gucci became a publicly traded company.

373
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.741
Oh, my God, it's Capitol Barbie.

374
00:20:20.817 --> 00:20:22.944
She's so shiny.

375
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.920
So where should I start?

376
00:20:24.988 --> 00:20:26.455
Excuse me, sweetie?

377
00:20:26.523 --> 00:20:30.118
Intern orientation is down the hall in Room 216.

378
00:20:30.193 --> 00:20:33.924
That's before 217 and after 215.

379
00:20:33.997 --> 00:20:36.295
Oh, my God! That is so sweet of you!

380
00:20:36.366 --> 00:20:38.163
You think I'm an intern?

381
00:20:38.235 --> 00:20:41.170
That anti-wrinkle all-salmon diet really works.

382
00:20:41.238 --> 00:20:42.432
Who are you?

383
00:20:42.506 --> 00:20:47.068
-I'm sorry-- -Elle Woods, welcome!

384
00:20:47.144 --> 00:20:49.704
I haven't seen you since the alumni meeting!

385
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.011
-I know! How are you? -Good!

386
00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:55.074
This is Elle Woods, everyone.

387
00:20:55.152 --> 00:20:58.417
Basically me when I first came to D.C...

388
00:20:58.488 --> 00:21:01.582
so make her feel at home.

389
00:21:01.658 --> 00:21:03.216
You ready to hit the ground running?

390
00:21:03.293 --> 00:21:05.318
Are these not my comfortable heels?

391
00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:09.456
-Cute shoes. -Thank you. They are comfy.

392
00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:13.292
Here's Bruiser. Welcome.

393
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:17.968
Oh, you little sugar!

394
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:19.770
Back her up, people.

395
00:21:19.843 --> 00:21:22.710
This is the most collaborative bunch on the Hill...

396
00:21:22.779 --> 00:21:24.406
So gather them together...

397
00:21:24.481 --> 00:21:26.449
talk strategy as soon as you get settled in.

398
00:21:26.516 --> 00:21:28.074
-And, Elle? -Yes?

399
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:31.177
-Welcome to Washington. -Thank you!

400
00:21:31.254 --> 00:21:34.189
Okey-dokey.

401
00:21:34.257 --> 00:21:37.158
I missed the part about where my office is.

402
00:21:37.227 --> 00:21:40.060
The desk. Right here.

403
00:21:43.367 --> 00:21:46.768
All righty. Then I'm going to need a glue gun...

404
00:21:46.837 --> 00:21:50.933
some pinking shears, and five yards of grosgrain ribbon.

405
00:21:51.007 --> 00:21:52.998
Yeah, that'll do it.

406
00:21:56.113 --> 00:21:58.445
Well, look at you.

407
00:21:58.515 --> 00:22:00.506
You can run your wedding coordinator business...

408
00:22:00.584 --> 00:22:02.415
during all that legislative downtime.

409
00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:03.976
Don't be silly, Grace.

410
00:22:04.054 --> 00:22:06.284
This is to plan my own wedding to Emmett.

411
00:22:06.356 --> 00:22:09.018
See, this is us. He had this made for me.

412
00:22:09.092 --> 00:22:12.255
That's him, and that's me smiling.

413
00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:13.694
Maybe he'll make one of you and me.

414
00:22:13.764 --> 00:22:15.527
You'll be talking and I'll be throwing up.

415
00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:18.067
Speaking of nuptials, wait till I tell...

416
00:22:18.135 --> 00:22:19.796
the congresswoman that I was invited...

417
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.804
to John McCain's nephew's wedding.

418
00:22:21.872 --> 00:22:23.737
He's really quite a sweet kid.

419
00:22:23.807 --> 00:22:25.399
Tell me something, Timothy...

420
00:22:25.475 --> 00:22:28.035
is it difficult for you to breathe with...

421
00:22:28.111 --> 00:22:30.272
your mouth flat against your employer's butt?

422
00:22:30.347 --> 00:22:32.975
I don't know, Grace. Is it difficult to see...

423
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:35.108
with your head in the Minority Whip's lap?

424
00:22:35.185 --> 00:22:37.415
It was the distinguished gentlemen from lowa.

425
00:22:37.487 --> 00:22:40.149
His wife had recently left him and we just talked.

426
00:22:40.223 --> 00:22:43.192
Right. Because if you did "visit" his district...

427
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.694
you should've gotten some legislation out of it.

428
00:22:45.762 --> 00:22:46.888
How would you even know...

429
00:22:46.963 --> 00:22:49.431
when you're busy chasing interns on a skateboard?

430
00:22:49.499 --> 00:22:52.366
Excuse me? Who wants to talk animal testing?

431
00:22:52.436 --> 00:22:54.802
Write a bill, Britney. I don't have a car!

432
00:23:00.777 --> 00:23:02.176
Snap Cup time

433
00:23:02.245 --> 00:23:04.543
Gather ye round

434
00:23:04.614 --> 00:23:07.412
Friends and foes together

435
00:23:07.484 --> 00:23:09.918
United and bound

436
00:23:09.986 --> 00:23:12.318
Pass it to your neighbor

437
00:23:12.389 --> 00:23:14.516
Instead of blowing up

438
00:23:14.591 --> 00:23:16.821
And we'll find harmony and love

439
00:23:16.893 --> 00:23:19.157
In the Snap Cup!

440
00:23:20.664 --> 00:23:23.098
Don't tell me you don't know what a Snap Cup is?

441
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:26.935
OK, I'll explain it.

442
00:23:27.003 --> 00:23:30.234
You are going to write down an anonymous praise note...

443
00:23:30.307 --> 00:23:32.241
on a little warm fuzzy.

444
00:23:32.309 --> 00:23:33.469
Warm fuzzy?

445
00:23:33.543 --> 00:23:34.976
Yes. Compliments about your co-workers.

446
00:23:35.045 --> 00:23:36.307
Just something nice.

447
00:23:36.379 --> 00:23:39.746
Then you deposit them in the sacred vessel.

448
00:23:39.816 --> 00:23:43.274
The Snap Cup is essential to any bipartisan environment.

449
00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:45.218
Consider 1998 Spring Carnival.

450
00:23:45.288 --> 00:23:48.314
The Delta Nus partnered with the Kappa Kappa Gammas...

451
00:23:48.391 --> 00:23:51.258
on Project Kissing Booth. Big problems.

452
00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:52.522
Go ahead, write.

453
00:23:52.596 --> 00:23:54.826
So, a whole heated debate transpired...

454
00:23:54.898 --> 00:23:56.957
over the whole tongue-no tongue policy.

455
00:23:57.033 --> 00:23:58.864
I think you know what side the Kappas were on.

456
00:23:58.935 --> 00:24:01.870
Anyway, it really helped us move past the conflict...

457
00:24:01.938 --> 00:24:03.428
and I think it can help us today.

458
00:24:03.507 --> 00:24:06.874
Let's just try this, OK?

459
00:24:06.943 --> 00:24:09.275
Thank you, Reena. Thank you.

460
00:24:09.346 --> 00:24:10.540
Thanks for that.

461
00:24:10.614 --> 00:24:12.707
Thank you, Timothy.

462
00:24:14.084 --> 00:24:20.353
So now, the Snap Cup mistress--me--recites.

463
00:24:21.391 --> 00:24:23.188
Good, I got mine.

464
00:24:24.528 --> 00:24:27.827
"Grace always has the confidence to speak her mind.

465
00:24:27.898 --> 00:24:30.958
"Plus, she looks terrific in charcoal."

466
00:24:31.034 --> 00:24:33.434
And, voila, snaps for Grace!

467
00:24:33.503 --> 00:24:36.472
You see? Our first Snap Cup!

468
00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:40.442
This is so exciting! I wonder what'll happen next?

469
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.479
All right, this is...

470
00:24:43.547 --> 00:24:48.007
"What do Elle Woods and the Snap Cup have in common?"

471
00:24:48.084 --> 00:24:50.314
A riddle. That's so cool.

472
00:24:50.387 --> 00:24:51.911
I love riddles.

473
00:24:51.988 --> 00:24:54.821
"They're both..."

474
00:24:58.061 --> 00:25:00.120
"stupid."

475
00:25:00.196 --> 00:25:01.925
Enough already.

476
00:25:01.998 --> 00:25:04.796
Maybe we can do something actually worthwhile...

477
00:25:04.868 --> 00:25:06.301
Iike attend the hearing of the committee...

478
00:25:06.369 --> 00:25:08.633
you need to crack. I'll take you myself.

479
00:25:08.705 --> 00:25:12.664
Thank you, Grace. That's very generous of you.

480
00:25:12.742 --> 00:25:16.112
See, I think the Snap Cup really works.

481
00:25:19.249 --> 00:25:20.409
Wow.

482
00:25:20.483 --> 00:25:22.747
Good morning.

483
00:25:22.819 --> 00:25:25.913
This is just like on C-SPAN except I'm not bored.

484
00:25:25.989 --> 00:25:27.320
You're in the wrong room, sweetheart.

485
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.290
Intern orientation is in room...

486
00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:32.556
216? Yes, I've heard. Thank you.

487
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.263
Hi, I'm Elle Woods. I'm not an intern.

488
00:25:40.337 --> 00:25:41.827
Rob Cole. Me, neither.

489
00:25:41.905 --> 00:25:44.430
I'm the new legislative aide to Congresswoman Rudd.

490
00:25:44.507 --> 00:25:46.532
I'm an old congressman from Delaware.

491
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.102
I've been to Delaware! No sales tax. Good one, sir.

492
00:25:51.147 --> 00:25:53.547
Committee is called to order.

493
00:25:55.485 --> 00:25:59.444
Welcome to the special meeting of the...

494
00:25:59.522 --> 00:26:00.989
Excuse me. Sorry.

495
00:26:01.057 --> 00:26:03.719
Committee of Energy and Commerce.

496
00:26:03.793 --> 00:26:07.627
Before we turn to our official agenda...

497
00:26:07.697 --> 00:26:09.790
are there any introductory remarks?

498
00:26:09.866 --> 00:26:11.527
Madam chairwoman...

499
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:13.432
Grace Rossiter, chief of staff...

500
00:26:13.503 --> 00:26:15.300
Representative Rudd, Massachusetts.

501
00:26:15.372 --> 00:26:17.135
As our newest legislative assistant...

502
00:26:17.207 --> 00:26:20.870
will be spearheading a campaign under your committee...

503
00:26:20.944 --> 00:26:22.673
I'm sure she'd love the floor.

504
00:26:22.746 --> 00:26:27.012
Thus I yield to my colleague, the lady in hot pink.

505
00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:29.677
You have the floor, lady in hot pink.

506
00:26:29.753 --> 00:26:31.220
Me?

507
00:26:31.287 --> 00:26:35.155
Would you care to more specifically identify yourself?

508
00:26:35.225 --> 00:26:36.817
Oh, sure!

509
00:26:36.893 --> 00:26:40.090
My name is Elle Woods, Boston by way of Bel Air.

510
00:26:40.163 --> 00:26:41.926
And as my surname would suggest...

511
00:26:41.998 --> 00:26:44.626
I am a passionate advocate for everything in nature...

512
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:45.861
and a contented citizen...

513
00:26:45.935 --> 00:26:48.495
until my shorthaired Chihuahua, Bruiser...

514
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:51.768
brought me face-to-face with the animal testing issue.

515
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:53.240
You're out of order, Miss Woods.

516
00:26:53.309 --> 00:26:55.539
This is a fuel efficiency hearing.

517
00:26:55.612 --> 00:26:58.274
I don't see anything in the agenda about animal testing.

518
00:26:58.348 --> 00:26:59.474
Will you yield the floor?

519
00:26:59.549 --> 00:27:01.073
Absolutely. I'm almost done.

520
00:27:01.151 --> 00:27:03.676
So, in conclusion, I just want to say...

521
00:27:03.753 --> 00:27:05.084
that I am so excited about the day...

522
00:27:05.155 --> 00:27:07.282
that I get to march up those grand Capitol steps...

523
00:27:07.357 --> 00:27:11.020
and drop that very bill in the...

524
00:27:11.094 --> 00:27:12.721
What's it called?

525
00:27:12.796 --> 00:27:15.765
It's like a shiny, mahogany box thing?

526
00:27:15.832 --> 00:27:16.958
The hopper.

527
00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:19.900
Exactly! The hopper! How could I forget?

528
00:27:19.969 --> 00:27:22.335
It's like a bunny. Perfect for animal testing.

529
00:27:22.405 --> 00:27:24.305
And I want to let everybody know...

530
00:27:24.374 --> 00:27:26.706
that I'm having a post-hopper tapas party.

531
00:27:26.776 --> 00:27:29.836
I'm making sangria. It's really yummy.

532
00:27:29.913 --> 00:27:33.041
My, my, how very interesting that all sounds.

533
00:27:33.116 --> 00:27:35.277
It'll be fun.

534
00:27:35.351 --> 00:27:37.080
However, the next time you consider...

535
00:27:37.153 --> 00:27:41.920
attending a hearing over which I preside...don't!

536
00:27:45.428 --> 00:27:47.089
Committee is called to order.

537
00:27:47.163 --> 00:27:48.425
OK.

538
00:27:48.498 --> 00:27:50.591
Welcome to the special meeting of the Committee...

539
00:27:50.667 --> 00:27:53.431
of Energy and Commerce. For the record...

540
00:27:53.503 --> 00:27:55.334
would the secretary please make note that...

541
00:27:56.906 --> 00:27:58.931
Welcome to the Wellington, ma'am.

542
00:28:05.248 --> 00:28:07.512
Seventeen-B?

543
00:28:09.686 --> 00:28:12.154
You have a package.

544
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.417
Inside that box are the most perfect wedding shoes ever.

545
00:28:17.494 --> 00:28:19.121
Both visually stunning and cleated.

546
00:28:19.195 --> 00:28:20.457
And I won't be able to wear them...

547
00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:22.293
since I obviously won't make the date...

548
00:28:22.365 --> 00:28:23.923
for Emmett's fantasy baseball wedding...

549
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.399
given that I don't have a chance of getting...

550
00:28:25.468 --> 00:28:27.800
those important congresspeople to co-sponsor my bill...

551
00:28:27.871 --> 00:28:31.102
which I need to get a hearing to stop animal testing...

552
00:28:31.174 --> 00:28:32.698
in order to reunite Bruiser with his mother...

553
00:28:32.776 --> 00:28:34.403
in order to have them at my wedding...

554
00:28:34.477 --> 00:28:35.637
in which I was going to wear...

555
00:28:35.712 --> 00:28:38.306
the most perfect wedding shoes ever...

556
00:28:38.381 --> 00:28:40.849
right inside that box.

557
00:28:40.917 --> 00:28:44.944
They never covered this in the handbook.

558
00:28:49.959 --> 00:28:53.224
They're something, all right.

559
00:28:55.031 --> 00:28:56.362
You think?

560
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.227
Oh, I'm sorry.

561
00:29:02.438 --> 00:29:04.736
Elle Woods, legislative aide...

562
00:29:04.808 --> 00:29:07.333
to Congresswoman Rudd, Massachusetts.

563
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:10.402
Sid Post. Doorman.

564
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.381
That door.

565
00:29:13.449 --> 00:29:16.577
All day I've felt like white, open-toed shoes after Labor Day.

566
00:29:16.653 --> 00:29:18.814
I hate that feeling.

567
00:29:18.888 --> 00:29:21.789
Whatever that means.

568
00:29:21.858 --> 00:29:26.454
I better get going. If I'm going to pass a law...

569
00:29:26.529 --> 00:29:28.690
I have to work up some plan of attack...

570
00:29:28.765 --> 00:29:33.225
with the Committee of En and Ron or whatever.

571
00:29:33.303 --> 00:29:35.362
Bye, Sid.

572
00:29:35.438 --> 00:29:39.067
-Comm. -What'd you say?

573
00:29:39.142 --> 00:29:42.908
It's called the Committee of Energy and Commerce.

574
00:29:42.979 --> 00:29:47.006
Oh, yeah. Right. Thanks.

575
00:29:56.392 --> 00:29:58.223
This is really important to me, Grace.

576
00:29:58.294 --> 00:30:00.091
They wouldn't cover my nana's anti-itch cream...

577
00:30:00.163 --> 00:30:02.859
which means she only has one free hand for bingo.

578
00:30:02.932 --> 00:30:05.765
-lf I could get a hearing-- -Where's your bill, Reena?

579
00:30:05.835 --> 00:30:08.065
The staff lawyers couldn't draft it for six weeks...

580
00:30:08.137 --> 00:30:10.002
but if you could talk to the congressman's aide...

581
00:30:10.073 --> 00:30:11.836
I could get on the agenda.

582
00:30:11.908 --> 00:30:14.138
We pushed prescription drugs last term.

583
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.236
I have a lot of issues that come first.

584
00:30:17.313 --> 00:30:21.477
Reena, if Grace finds herself otherwise prioritized...

585
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:23.610
maybe you could talk to this aide yourself.

586
00:30:23.686 --> 00:30:26.280
Or better yet, directly to the congressman.

587
00:30:26.356 --> 00:30:30.417
Don't you have something to alphabetize?

588
00:30:30.493 --> 00:30:33.860
In fact, now that I think about it...

589
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.262
with Reena's clear passion for the project...

590
00:30:36.332 --> 00:30:37.993
who better to write this bill than Reena?

591
00:30:38.067 --> 00:30:39.432
Me?

592
00:30:39.502 --> 00:30:40.867
It's like I always say--

593
00:30:40.937 --> 00:30:43.633
Why let someone else do for you what you can do for yourself?

594
00:30:43.706 --> 00:30:45.503
Except in the case of eyebrow maintenance.

595
00:30:45.575 --> 00:30:47.634
We always say follow protocol.

596
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:49.109
It's worked for the past 200 years...

597
00:30:49.178 --> 00:30:51.146
OK, Miss Snap Cup?

598
00:30:51.214 --> 00:30:55.480
Stick it out with the lawyers. They'll get to you eventually.

599
00:30:55.551 --> 00:30:58.486
This is the new congressmember roster.

600
00:31:04.394 --> 00:31:05.656
Just a dollar.

601
00:31:05.728 --> 00:31:07.525
Don't you believe in helping a guy out?

602
00:31:07.597 --> 00:31:08.859
What I do believe in, sir...

603
00:31:08.932 --> 00:31:11.025
is an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.

604
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.624
Not rewards for idleness.

605
00:31:12.702 --> 00:31:14.294
-50 cents? -Leave me!

606
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.395
-Just a quarter. -Go bother someone else!

607
00:31:20.843 --> 00:31:23.641
People here have no common courtesy.

608
00:31:23.713 --> 00:31:26.204
Want to get a hearing for your bill?

609
00:31:26.282 --> 00:31:29.308
Get Congresswoman Hauser. She needs a political makeover.

610
00:31:29.385 --> 00:31:31.819
Sidney?

611
00:31:31.888 --> 00:31:34.220
Who needs a what?

612
00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:38.386
Hauser. Tough redhead on En and Comm.

613
00:31:38.461 --> 00:31:41.726
If she can put her name on something warm and fuzzy...

614
00:31:41.798 --> 00:31:47.031
something like puppies, that could do the trick.

615
00:31:47.103 --> 00:31:50.095
Really? What if I showed Hauser the photos...

616
00:31:50.173 --> 00:31:51.731
of what they're doing to these animals?

617
00:31:51.808 --> 00:31:56.871
That'd work... with someone with a heart.

618
00:31:56.946 --> 00:32:00.313
Hauser responds to facts, figures, and demographics.

619
00:32:00.383 --> 00:32:02.408
You gotta do your homework.

620
00:32:02.485 --> 00:32:04.749
How did you learn all this?

621
00:32:04.821 --> 00:32:06.618
I have been stationed on the forefront...

622
00:32:06.689 --> 00:32:09.283
of all major political and social scandals...

623
00:32:09.359 --> 00:32:11.418
for the past 30 years.

624
00:32:11.494 --> 00:32:13.553
You worked in the White House?

625
00:32:13.629 --> 00:32:16.496
No, at the Wellington.

626
00:32:16.566 --> 00:32:18.932
After Hauser, you'll need Stanford Marks...

627
00:32:19.002 --> 00:32:21.334
Alabama Republican. A real hard-ass.

628
00:32:21.404 --> 00:32:22.769
Sidney, you are, without a doubt...

629
00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:25.808
the most useful person I've met in Washington.

630
00:33:04.213 --> 00:33:05.908
Hauser's margin in the last election?

631
00:33:05.982 --> 00:33:07.279
Four points. 52-48.

632
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.476
Hauser's chief?

633
00:33:08.551 --> 00:33:11.281
Hall, Ted. 34, moderate, tough.

634
00:33:11.354 --> 00:33:14.221
-Marks' aide? -Murphy. Conservative, tougher.

635
00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:17.350
-I think you're ready. -Thank you, Sid.

636
00:33:18.728 --> 00:33:21.561
For shizzle...my ezzle.

637
00:33:26.736 --> 00:33:29.136
I borrowed this.

638
00:33:36.112 --> 00:33:38.012
Excuse me!

639
00:33:38.081 --> 00:33:39.673
Given the historical tendencies...

640
00:33:39.749 --> 00:33:41.114
of the congresswoman's voting pool...

641
00:33:41.184 --> 00:33:44.051
animal testing is the very issue your platform needs.

642
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.213
Which brings me to my demographic breakdown target.

643
00:33:46.289 --> 00:33:49.349
Which brings us to the end of our time, but good stuff.

644
00:33:49.425 --> 00:33:50.653
I'll bat it around with my colleagues.

645
00:33:50.726 --> 00:33:52.421
I'm not done with my presentation.

646
00:33:52.495 --> 00:33:53.962
-ls Friday good? -Absolutely.

647
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:57.966
The second one in November, and the line starts down there.

648
00:33:58.034 --> 00:34:00.901
But wait! I won't be here in November.

649
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.403
I'm getting married.

650
00:34:03.639 --> 00:34:05.368
If you insist Congressman Marks is unavailable...

651
00:34:05.441 --> 00:34:06.567
perhaps you could look at...

652
00:34:06.642 --> 00:34:09.008
my alternative testing economics incentive chart.

653
00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.838
But it's pop-up.

654
00:34:14.417 --> 00:34:17.818
I will read this homeowners legislation this weekend.

655
00:34:17.887 --> 00:34:20.185
Five more minutes and I'm due in committee. Reena.

656
00:34:20.256 --> 00:34:21.416
Well--

657
00:34:21.491 --> 00:34:23.721
Reena's prescription drugs for the elderly amendment--

658
00:34:23.793 --> 00:34:25.283
rejected during mark-up session.

659
00:34:25.361 --> 00:34:26.658
Sorry, Nana.

660
00:34:26.729 --> 00:34:30.130
-Where are we with the animals? -Still not on the calendar.

661
00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:32.667
So we're nowhere. Grace, help Elle with this.

662
00:34:32.735 --> 00:34:35.966
Let's get going. I'll see you all later.

663
00:34:36.038 --> 00:34:38.438
Grace...

664
00:34:38.508 --> 00:34:40.976
I think I can get a meeting with Hauser's aide.

665
00:34:41.043 --> 00:34:43.238
Please. You could have 100 meetings...

666
00:34:43.312 --> 00:34:44.745
and it still wouldn't matter.

667
00:34:44.814 --> 00:34:46.543
This is Washington politics...

668
00:34:46.616 --> 00:34:48.982
not warm fuzzies and kissing booths.

669
00:34:49.051 --> 00:34:51.383
It takes savvy and street smarts.

670
00:34:51.454 --> 00:34:54.685
I've seen thousands of polite, idealistic girls...

671
00:34:54.757 --> 00:34:57.624
just like you traipse up and down this Hill...

672
00:34:57.693 --> 00:35:01.561
and go home empty-handed with blisters on their feet.

673
00:35:01.631 --> 00:35:05.032
Thank you, Grace.

674
00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:08.434
You actually reminded me of something really important.

675
00:35:08.504 --> 00:35:10.972
I came here to give my dog a voice...

676
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.372
and I'd forgotten about my own.

677
00:35:13.442 --> 00:35:16.536
So you can do it the Washington way.

678
00:35:16.612 --> 00:35:21.174
But I'm going to do it the Elle Woods way.

679
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:21.350
Time to get serious.

680
00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.783
Time to get serious.

681
00:35:22.852 --> 00:35:25.480
Subject--Congresswoman Libby Hauser.

682
00:35:25.555 --> 00:35:26.954
Came of age in Post-War boom...

683
00:35:27.023 --> 00:35:30.424
typified by 1951 Charles Jourdan stiletto heel.

684
00:35:30.493 --> 00:35:33.223
Moving up to the Texan's head, which is red...

685
00:35:33.296 --> 00:35:36.129
suspect chemical assistance. Must pursue.

686
00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.757
Hit me, Post.

687
00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:40.393
118 salons within a 10-mile radius...

688
00:35:40.469 --> 00:35:42.630
broken down by color expertise...

689
00:35:42.705 --> 00:35:48.075
and philosophical approach to hair maintenance and style.

690
00:35:48.144 --> 00:35:51.113
I didn't know you could have a philosophy of hair.

691
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.477
Oh, yeah.

692
00:35:52.548 --> 00:35:54.846
Maybe that's where I went wrong.

693
00:35:56.419 --> 00:35:57.613
Go for Woods.

694
00:35:57.687 --> 00:35:59.450
It's just as you suspected.

695
00:35:59.522 --> 00:36:01.649
She's at a moderate conservative salon...

696
00:36:01.724 --> 00:36:04.158
founded on the principles of Vidal.

697
00:36:04.227 --> 00:36:07.219
In fact, it was one of our case studies...

698
00:36:07.296 --> 00:36:09.457
Iast year at Hair University.

699
00:36:09.532 --> 00:36:11.762
That was right before they flunked me.

700
00:36:11.834 --> 00:36:14.132
Paulette, they weren't ready for your vision.

701
00:36:14.203 --> 00:36:16.831
I know you'll make your mark hair-wise.

702
00:36:18.007 --> 00:36:19.474
Sorry.

703
00:36:19.542 --> 00:36:21.908
-You got a pen? -Yes.

704
00:36:21.978 --> 00:36:24.173
It's at Constitution and 12th.

705
00:36:24.247 --> 00:36:26.807
The Salon Bontempo.

706
00:36:30.186 --> 00:36:32.347
Don't you just love a salon day?

707
00:36:35.258 --> 00:36:38.819
Yes, so peaceful and quiet.

708
00:36:38.894 --> 00:36:41.192
Makes it so much easier to talk that way.

709
00:36:41.264 --> 00:36:42.822
They have rules about that here.

710
00:36:42.898 --> 00:36:45.526
I know. That's why I called to make sure...

711
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:47.466
they used PETA-approved hair care products.

712
00:36:47.536 --> 00:36:49.697
When you think about what they do to those animals--

713
00:36:49.772 --> 00:36:51.831
Which is why I don't think about it.

714
00:36:51.907 --> 00:36:53.534
Does the trick.

715
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.845
Excellent bobby pin handling.

716
00:36:58.914 --> 00:37:01.906
Thank you, Frederic. Looks great.

717
00:37:04.353 --> 00:37:06.150
Isn't it so comforting to see...

718
00:37:06.222 --> 00:37:08.213
they use eco-friendly foil technology here?

719
00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:10.885
Every planet needs a friend, that's what I always say.

720
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.793
If I wanted to talk about the emotional life of a rock...

721
00:37:13.863 --> 00:37:16.696
you'd know it by now.

722
00:37:16.766 --> 00:37:19.200
Until this day, I'd held the highest opinion...

723
00:37:19.268 --> 00:37:21.964
of redheads as a fellow hair minority group.

724
00:37:22.038 --> 00:37:24.199
I heard quite enough of your politics...

725
00:37:24.273 --> 00:37:26.400
at the committee meeting, thank you very much.

726
00:37:43.926 --> 00:37:47.384
When was the last time you wore the yellow tea rose?

727
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.134
I'm sorry? What did you just--

728
00:37:57.206 --> 00:37:59.640
When was the last time you wore your yellow tea rose?

729
00:37:59.709 --> 00:38:01.939
On the night of my initiation.

730
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:04.206
Wasn't the passing of the secret scented eternal flame...

731
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.874
of the goddess Delta Nu not the most moving experience?

732
00:38:06.949 --> 00:38:08.974
Especially the part where we sipped...

733
00:38:09.051 --> 00:38:11.713
from the secret pink chalice of sisterhood!

734
00:38:11.787 --> 00:38:13.516
Yes!

735
00:38:17.893 --> 00:38:20.054
Delta who?

736
00:38:20.129 --> 00:38:22.290
Delta Nu!

737
00:38:22.365 --> 00:38:25.596
Delta-Delta boo-gah-loo

738
00:38:25.668 --> 00:38:28.296
Nu Nu Delta

739
00:38:28.371 --> 00:38:29.702
Theta, Beta

740
00:38:29.772 --> 00:38:31.171
Lambda, Mu

741
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.835
Ooh-aah, Delta Nu!

742
00:38:36.379 --> 00:38:39.542
Libby Hauser, Texas. Planning a wedding?

743
00:38:39.615 --> 00:38:42.516
That "l do" updo looks like heaven on you.

744
00:38:42.585 --> 00:38:43.745
Thank you.

745
00:38:43.819 --> 00:38:46.344
Who is he? Zeta Lambda Nu, I hope.

746
00:38:46.422 --> 00:38:48.515
Actually, I'm marrying outside the Greek system...

747
00:38:48.591 --> 00:38:50.320
but he's totally letter-worthy.

748
00:38:50.393 --> 00:38:54.830
But how is D.C. Elle-worthy?

749
00:38:54.897 --> 00:38:57.422
I'm here to speak for those who can't speak for themselves.

750
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.468
How interesting.

751
00:38:59.535 --> 00:39:01.833
It's more than interesting. It's practical.

752
00:39:01.904 --> 00:39:04.270
Strictly a numbers game as far as you're concerned.

753
00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:09.937
125,468--Number of people in your district with dog licenses.

754
00:39:10.012 --> 00:39:13.948
12,762--The number of unemployed scientists...

755
00:39:14.016 --> 00:39:16.951
with the skills to develop alternatives to animal testing.

756
00:39:17.019 --> 00:39:21.683
And finally, 6285--the lD number of my dog's captive mother.

757
00:39:21.757 --> 00:39:24.885
I'm not sure I followed all that...

758
00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.450
but you got my attention.

759
00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:28.121
If there's one thing I know how to do...

760
00:39:28.197 --> 00:39:30.290
it's rinse and repeat. Shall we?

761
00:39:32.268 --> 00:39:33.428
Excuse me, do you happen to have a--

762
00:39:33.502 --> 00:39:35.493
-Get lost! -Excuse me, sir!

763
00:39:35.571 --> 00:39:38.904
-Do you have a-- -No, I'm busy.

764
00:39:38.974 --> 00:39:40.908
Sir, could I use a section of your newspaper?

765
00:39:40.976 --> 00:39:43.035
We're late for your doggie spa appointment.

766
00:39:47.716 --> 00:39:50.207
-Here you go. -Thank you, young lady.

767
00:39:50.286 --> 00:39:52.345
No problem. What kind of world would this be...

768
00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:54.889
if we didn't help each other out every once in a while?

769
00:39:54.957 --> 00:39:57.425
Have a good day.

770
00:39:57.493 --> 00:39:59.154
What do you want, Bruiser?

771
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.365
Bruiser, honey, come on.

772
00:40:15.077 --> 00:40:16.271
We have to go. We're late.

773
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.273
We have to get to the doggie spa, remember?

774
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:23.785
Will it be Swedish or shiatsu massage today?

775
00:40:23.853 --> 00:40:25.821
Come on.

776
00:40:29.558 --> 00:40:32.049
Come on. We gotta get you to the puppy pretty parlor.

777
00:40:33.696 --> 00:40:36.221
Redhead, down.

778
00:40:36.298 --> 00:40:38.357
Up next is Stanford Marks...

779
00:40:38.434 --> 00:40:41.028
Southern conservative, NRA spokesman.

780
00:40:41.103 --> 00:40:43.162
How about tulips?

781
00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:47.005
No, no, the calla lily is this year's tulip.

782
00:40:47.076 --> 00:40:49.943
-For weddings? -It's all about the calla.

783
00:40:50.012 --> 00:40:52.037
What would I do without you?

784
00:40:52.114 --> 00:40:54.480
I couldn't do anything without you, Sid.

785
00:40:55.584 --> 00:40:57.279
You're going to get this bill through, Elle.

786
00:40:57.353 --> 00:41:01.449
An honest voice is louder than a crowd's.

787
00:41:01.524 --> 00:41:03.583
Just trust your voice.

788
00:41:07.563 --> 00:41:12.330
Bruiser? Oh, my God. I'll be right back.

789
00:41:12.401 --> 00:41:12.535
Pilates for Poodles? That's Tuesday at 2:30.

790
00:41:12.535 --> 00:41:15.402
Pilates for Poodles? That's Tuesday at 2:30.

791
00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:18.763
-The page said it was urgent! -They said it was urgent.

792
00:41:18.841 --> 00:41:20.706
-Please tell me he's OK. -What's wrong with Leslie?

793
00:41:20.776 --> 00:41:22.573
We have it under control now...

794
00:41:22.645 --> 00:41:24.613
but your Rottweiler has been humping...

795
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.410
your little dog, and vice versa.

796
00:41:27.483 --> 00:41:30.145
Your Chihuahua's quite the little leaper, young lady.

797
00:41:30.219 --> 00:41:32.187
Takes a running start.

798
00:41:32.254 --> 00:41:35.621
Hell, what can I say? My Rottweiler's a stallion.

799
00:41:35.691 --> 00:41:38.854
In our household, we fully support a healthy curiosity.

800
00:41:38.928 --> 00:41:43.695
Testosterone is natural. Wait. Did you say stallion?

801
00:41:43.766 --> 00:41:45.757
Wait a minute. Your dog...

802
00:41:45.834 --> 00:41:47.927
the one wearing that ridiculous pink skirt in the park?

803
00:41:48.003 --> 00:41:50.096
Why would she have testosterone?

804
00:41:50.172 --> 00:41:51.867
That wasn't a skirt, it was a skort.

805
00:41:51.941 --> 00:41:53.738
-Men wear skorts. -Uh-huh.

806
00:41:53.809 --> 00:41:55.504
What the heck is a skort?

807
00:41:55.578 --> 00:41:57.512
And what does a man wearing one got to do with it?

808
00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:04.213
All right! Leslie is a Les. The Rottweiler is a guy...

809
00:42:04.286 --> 00:42:09.724
and Bruiser is a male dog who enjoys wearing pastel.

810
00:42:09.792 --> 00:42:12.920
The canines are both male.

811
00:42:18.334 --> 00:42:21.735
Your dogs are gay.

812
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.213
All the signs were there. I just didn't see them.

813
00:42:35.284 --> 00:42:37.514
Most dogs like to chew your shoes...

814
00:42:37.586 --> 00:42:40.987
and Bruiser liked to wear mine.

815
00:42:41.056 --> 00:42:44.287
I just thought he liked the height.

816
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.588
You just want what's best for them.

817
00:42:45.661 --> 00:42:47.094
Doesn't matter if they're the smartest...

818
00:42:47.162 --> 00:42:49.960
or the strongest or the best diggers.

819
00:42:50.032 --> 00:42:53.092
As long as they're happy.

820
00:42:53.168 --> 00:42:56.035
Why me? Why my dog?

821
00:42:56.105 --> 00:42:58.869
I told Doris not to buy it in Dupont Circle.

822
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:03.071
That damn homosexual puppy boutique.

823
00:43:03.145 --> 00:43:06.114
Stanford Marks, by the way. You can call me Stan.

824
00:43:06.181 --> 00:43:07.978
Elle Woods. Very nice to meet you.

825
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.416
You're the girl with the perfumed poo baggies.

826
00:43:10.486 --> 00:43:13.580
I'm the woman with the scented waste receptacles.

827
00:43:13.656 --> 00:43:17.217
Wait! Congressman Stanford Marks?

828
00:43:17.292 --> 00:43:18.623
As in the Southern conservative...

829
00:43:18.694 --> 00:43:21.094
NRA spokesman Alabama Republican Stanford Marks?

830
00:43:21.163 --> 00:43:22.460
One and the same.

831
00:43:22.531 --> 00:43:23.793
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

832
00:43:23.866 --> 00:43:26.994
No, Congressman, the pleasure is all mine.

833
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:29.629
-Well... -Believe me.

834
00:43:29.705 --> 00:43:32.640
Here's to getting things done the Washington way.

835
00:43:32.708 --> 00:43:35.040
Your chief of staff has just gotten herself...

836
00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:38.375
a meeting with--wait for it-- Chairman Stan Marks...

837
00:43:38.447 --> 00:43:40.438
in just four short weeks.

838
00:43:40.516 --> 00:43:43.383
-Congratulations, Grace. -Yes!

839
00:43:45.154 --> 00:43:48.749
Oh, yes. OK, who wants to bet...

840
00:43:48.824 --> 00:43:50.655
over-under on Ms. Woods departure?

841
00:43:50.726 --> 00:43:52.284
Right now it's at six days.

842
00:43:52.361 --> 00:43:53.028
-Reena? -No, thanks.

843
00:43:53.028 --> 00:43:54.325
-Reena? -No, thanks.

844
00:43:54.396 --> 00:43:56.023
Come on. Anybody?

845
00:43:56.098 --> 00:43:57.395
Who wants to take over six days?

846
00:43:57.466 --> 00:43:59.093
I'll take it, Grace.

847
00:43:59.168 --> 00:44:01.363
I've been so busy. I'm sorry I'm late.

848
00:44:01.437 --> 00:44:03.428
Reena, could you be a pal and just tell me...

849
00:44:03.505 --> 00:44:05.496
what I'm doing a week from tomorrow?

850
00:44:05.574 --> 00:44:07.769
By the way, that outfit looks fantastic on you.

851
00:44:07.843 --> 00:44:09.674
It really brings out the color in your eyes.

852
00:44:09.745 --> 00:44:11.679
Thanks.

853
00:44:11.747 --> 00:44:14.375
It's on my "l brake for sample sales" bookmark.

854
00:44:16.318 --> 00:44:19.879
9:00--sample custom color wedding cake frosting.

855
00:44:19.955 --> 00:44:22.082
10:00-- rehearse hearing speech.

856
00:44:22.157 --> 00:44:23.852
11 :00-- Commerce committee hearing.

857
00:44:23.926 --> 00:44:26.156
12:00-- exfoliating treatment--

858
00:44:26.228 --> 00:44:28.992
Go back to that one at 11 :00.

859
00:44:29.064 --> 00:44:32.522
11 :00-- Commerce committee hearing.

860
00:44:32.601 --> 00:44:34.000
That's what it says.

861
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:35.696
I'm going to be appearing before ranking member...

862
00:44:35.771 --> 00:44:37.363
Libby Hauser, Chairman Stanford Marks...

863
00:44:37.439 --> 00:44:39.066
and the entire Committee of En and Comm.

864
00:44:39.141 --> 00:44:41.871
A hop, skip, and a jump away from a floor vote.

865
00:44:41.944 --> 00:44:43.536
Nice try, but you have to get a bill...

866
00:44:43.612 --> 00:44:45.011
before you have a hearing.

867
00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.707
Like this one?

868
00:44:46.782 --> 00:44:48.807
It's like I was saying to the congresswoman...

869
00:44:48.884 --> 00:44:50.681
the other day over caramel macchiatos.

870
00:44:50.753 --> 00:44:53.017
"ls bill writing super fun or what?"

871
00:44:53.088 --> 00:44:54.885
I think so.

872
00:44:54.957 --> 00:44:58.154
Where is that Elle Woods?

873
00:44:58.227 --> 00:45:01.196
Oh, my God.

874
00:45:01.263 --> 00:45:04.232
-Libby just told me the news. -She did?

875
00:45:04.299 --> 00:45:05.630
Never underestimate a woman...

876
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:07.566
with a French manicure and a Harvard law degree.

877
00:45:07.636 --> 00:45:09.604
Thank you, Victoria. That's very sweet of you...

878
00:45:09.671 --> 00:45:12.606
but I couldn't have done it without your inspiration.

879
00:45:12.674 --> 00:45:15.472
I'm honored. This girl is special.

880
00:45:15.544 --> 00:45:18.308
Actually, I didn't do it alone.

881
00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.679
The entire team helped me. It was really a group effort.

882
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.275
Good work, guys. Really good work.

883
00:45:24.353 --> 00:45:26.446
-You. -Thanks.

884
00:45:27.523 --> 00:45:30.083
Thank you, Reena. You're a sweetheart.

885
00:45:30.159 --> 00:45:33.424
And I guess I will see you at the hopper.

886
00:46:09.064 --> 00:46:10.998
Ask not what your best friend can do for man...

887
00:46:11.066 --> 00:46:13.796
but what you can do for man's best friend.

888
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:20.438
The Committee on Energy and Commerce...

889
00:46:20.509 --> 00:46:22.238
will now come to order.

890
00:46:22.311 --> 00:46:26.213
HR 2562, aka Bruiser's Bill--

891
00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:28.681
Representative Victoria Rudd, sponsor...

892
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.684
proposing a ban on animal testing...

893
00:46:30.752 --> 00:46:32.845
in the cosmetics industry.

894
00:46:32.921 --> 00:46:34.354
I'd like to welcome you all today as we begin...

895
00:46:34.423 --> 00:46:36.550
consideration of this very important issue.

896
00:46:36.625 --> 00:46:39.423
This week, you will hear testimony from both sides...

897
00:46:39.494 --> 00:46:43.897
and I ask that you keep your ears and your minds open.

898
00:46:43.966 --> 00:46:45.934
This is my first congressional hearing.

899
00:46:46.001 --> 00:46:47.730
Can you believe it?

900
00:46:47.803 --> 00:46:49.168
And so I come to you today as a citizen...

901
00:46:49.238 --> 00:46:51.570
and a scientist with the National lnstitute of Health

902
00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.131
for 25 years, during which time...

903
00:46:54.209 --> 00:46:56.677
it's become increasingly clear that these supposed alternatives

904
00:46:56.745 --> 00:46:59.976
to animal testing aren't alternatives at all.

905
00:47:00.048 --> 00:47:03.984
I took this office to represent my two-legged constituents.

906
00:47:04.052 --> 00:47:07.988
Recently, I saw an item in a pet store with the label...

907
00:47:08.056 --> 00:47:10.752
"This product is tested on humans."

908
00:47:10.826 --> 00:47:12.726
That's a problem worth discussing.

909
00:47:17.132 --> 00:47:18.565
All the bleeding hearts...

910
00:47:18.634 --> 00:47:20.295
will try to distract us from the facts...

911
00:47:20.369 --> 00:47:23.429
with their saccharine talk of wagging tails...

912
00:47:23.505 --> 00:47:27.100
cold noses, and other sentimental mumbo jumbo.

913
00:47:27.175 --> 00:47:30.201
Consider this--where we see softness of heart...

914
00:47:30.279 --> 00:47:32.907
we often see softness of mind.

915
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:35.745
And so to move on such a bill at this juncture in time...

916
00:47:35.817 --> 00:47:38.149
would wreak havoc on already unstable...

917
00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.087
Iocal economies across the country.

918
00:47:41.156 --> 00:47:43.750
Now, that's a problem worth discussing.

919
00:47:45.928 --> 00:47:47.589
You know I'd do anything for you...

920
00:47:47.663 --> 00:47:49.597
but I got to tell you, that is one tough room.

921
00:47:49.665 --> 00:47:51.826
-Better be prepared tomorrow. -All right.

922
00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.334
Excuse me, ladies. Good evening.

923
00:47:54.403 --> 00:47:57.895
I know you've had a bad day in court before.

924
00:47:57.973 --> 00:47:59.201
It's the same thing.

925
00:47:59.274 --> 00:48:01.333
They make their case, we make ours.

926
00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:02.843
Yes, but that was bad.

927
00:48:02.911 --> 00:48:06.312
They're mostly posturing for their constituents back home.

928
00:48:06.381 --> 00:48:08.178
I think we have the votes in committee...

929
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.979
even without your testimony.

930
00:48:10.052 --> 00:48:13.818
But they have scientists and economists and facts.

931
00:48:13.889 --> 00:48:17.052
So do we. Elle, listen to me.

932
00:48:17.125 --> 00:48:20.458
Go home. Have an early evening.

933
00:48:20.529 --> 00:48:22.554
Sorry.

934
00:48:22.631 --> 00:48:25.532
Victoria Rudd. Yes.

935
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.398
Hang on one minute, will you?

936
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.303
Go home. Try to relax.

937
00:48:31.373 --> 00:48:35.241
And don't think like them. Think like you.

938
00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.676
OK. Thanks.

939
00:48:37.746 --> 00:48:39.839
-Good night. -Good night.

940
00:48:42.084 --> 00:48:43.676
Bob, how are you?

941
00:48:47.789 --> 00:48:50.349
I'm leaving the Capitol right now.

942
00:48:50.425 --> 00:48:53.360
-Thanks. Nice work. -Oh.

943
00:48:58.066 --> 00:48:59.192
Sid?

944
00:48:59.267 --> 00:49:02.725
I'm sorry about that. This happens all the time.

945
00:49:02.804 --> 00:49:04.396
My break is almost up...

946
00:49:04.473 --> 00:49:08.068
but I wanted to get you this before tomorrow.

947
00:49:08.143 --> 00:49:09.701
Great. Let's walk.

948
00:49:11.246 --> 00:49:13.146
Sidney, this is brilliant.

949
00:49:13.215 --> 00:49:15.274
How did you know all this?

950
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.911
Hundreds of dogs walked and thousands of plastic baggies.

951
00:49:18.987 --> 00:49:21.820
This is perfect. This is exactly what I need.

952
00:49:23.225 --> 00:49:26.661
Well, of course I appreciate your support.

953
00:49:26.728 --> 00:49:28.127
Why wouldn't it continue?

954
00:49:28.196 --> 00:49:31.324
I'm already on record on that issue.

955
00:49:37.005 --> 00:49:38.597
All right.

956
00:49:38.673 --> 00:49:40.504
I'll do what I can.

957
00:49:40.575 --> 00:49:43.009
Don't push me, Bob.

958
00:49:43.078 --> 00:49:44.943
I'll do what I can.

959
00:49:45.013 --> 00:49:47.345
All right. Good night.

960
00:49:51.686 --> 00:49:55.588
-I need to call in my favor. -I'm listening.

961
00:49:55.657 --> 00:49:59.093
I've changed my position on Bruiser's Bill.

962
00:49:59.161 --> 00:50:02.255
A man who controls a political machine...

963
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:05.629
Boy, he's good. He is really good.

964
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.429
I'm really glad we're watching this.

965
00:50:07.502 --> 00:50:09.163
This is good for you.

966
00:50:09.237 --> 00:50:10.431
He promised to break me in two.

967
00:50:10.505 --> 00:50:11.870
I'm starting to worry about...

968
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.703
getting all this wedding planning done.

969
00:50:13.775 --> 00:50:17.176
Elle, I want you to follow my lead in Washington.

970
00:50:17.245 --> 00:50:20.305
And always make sure Bruiser wears a sweater.

971
00:50:20.382 --> 00:50:23.681
-ls that Sean Connery? -No, it's not.

972
00:50:23.752 --> 00:50:25.242
Powerful enough to control congressmen...

973
00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.845
Seriously, honey, don't worry about the wedding research.

974
00:50:27.923 --> 00:50:30.255
Just give 'em hell tomorrow.

975
00:50:46.808 --> 00:50:49.709
The chair now recognizes legislative aide Elle Woods.

976
00:50:57.452 --> 00:50:58.578
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

977
00:50:58.653 --> 00:51:00.314
There she is!

978
00:51:00.388 --> 00:51:02.822
Guys, she really did it.

979
00:51:04.092 --> 00:51:05.354
Miss Woods?

980
00:51:05.427 --> 00:51:07.156
Well, I'll be damned.

981
00:51:07.229 --> 00:51:09.823
Representative Kroft...

982
00:51:09.898 --> 00:51:12.389
that lip gloss looks absolutely sensational on you.

983
00:51:13.435 --> 00:51:14.925
I'm sorry, what?

984
00:51:15.003 --> 00:51:17.437
It's Raspberry Macaroon number 156.

985
00:51:17.506 --> 00:51:19.497
Company shall remain nameless, is that correct?

986
00:51:19.574 --> 00:51:24.068
Well, yes. But how did you--

987
00:51:24.146 --> 00:51:25.841
What if I told you, Representative Kroft...

988
00:51:25.914 --> 00:51:27.973
that you owe that special bounce in your step...

989
00:51:28.049 --> 00:51:30.779
that only comes from finding the perfect lipstick...

990
00:51:30.852 --> 00:51:34.845
to the pain and suffering of innocent animals?

991
00:51:34.923 --> 00:51:36.356
What if I was to tell you...

992
00:51:36.424 --> 00:51:38.449
Congresswoman Madeline Melanie Kroft...

993
00:51:38.527 --> 00:51:40.859
that you owe your Raspberry Macaroon...

994
00:51:43.365 --> 00:51:46.391
to him?

995
00:51:46.468 --> 00:51:48.026
My best friend.

996
00:51:52.541 --> 00:51:54.304
Bruiser.

997
00:51:54.376 --> 00:51:57.402
How many times has he acted on my behalf?

998
00:51:57.479 --> 00:51:59.743
Countless.

999
00:51:59.814 --> 00:52:05.150
But today, I get the opportunity to speak for him.

1000
00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:08.155
Who do you speak for?

1001
00:52:13.495 --> 00:52:15.395
Congressman Fuchs...

1002
00:52:15.463 --> 00:52:19.160
the next time you reach for your overnight moisturizing gloves--

1003
00:52:19.234 --> 00:52:20.895
By the way, it's nothing to be ashamed about.

1004
00:52:20.969 --> 00:52:23.096
More men should use them.

1005
00:52:23.171 --> 00:52:27.267
Consider asking yourself what you're willing to sacrifice...

1006
00:52:27.342 --> 00:52:29.970
in the name of beauty and soft cuticles.

1007
00:52:30.045 --> 00:52:33.640
Are you willing to sacrifice animal welfare?

1008
00:52:33.715 --> 00:52:36.377
Or how about the welfare of one animal?

1009
00:52:36.451 --> 00:52:39.113
Like Jelly, your childhood pal...

1010
00:52:39.187 --> 00:52:42.350
that striking retriever-black lab mix.

1011
00:52:44.526 --> 00:52:48.189
You know about Jelly?

1012
00:52:48.263 --> 00:52:51.391
When all the other children refused to play Lone Ranger...

1013
00:52:51.466 --> 00:52:53.696
who was it that was always your Tonto?

1014
00:52:53.768 --> 00:52:56.293
Jelly Belly.

1015
00:53:07.415 --> 00:53:10.350
Mr. Chairman...

1016
00:53:10.418 --> 00:53:12.511
when you look in those snap-worthy almond eyes...

1017
00:53:12.587 --> 00:53:13.815
of your Rottweiler Leslie...

1018
00:53:13.888 --> 00:53:16.652
does it not make your heart glow with warmth?

1019
00:53:16.725 --> 00:53:19.819
With due respect, Ms. Woods, I wouldn't go that far.

1020
00:53:19.894 --> 00:53:21.418
But when he learned to differentiate...

1021
00:53:21.496 --> 00:53:23.293
between seven different kinds of pipes...

1022
00:53:23.365 --> 00:53:25.697
and fetch each one on command, did you not swear...

1023
00:53:25.767 --> 00:53:27.894
to protect him with every shotgun...

1024
00:53:27.969 --> 00:53:32.099
in your charming little ammunitions case?

1025
00:53:32.173 --> 00:53:33.504
It wouldn't come to that.

1026
00:53:33.575 --> 00:53:36.840
This is a dog we're talking about.

1027
00:53:36.911 --> 00:53:39.106
But if you could speak for Leslie...

1028
00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.273
what would you say?

1029
00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:51.085
What would Leslie want you to say for him, Mr. Chairman?

1030
00:53:54.529 --> 00:53:56.497
Stan.

1031
00:54:06.608 --> 00:54:07.768
To hell with it.

1032
00:54:09.144 --> 00:54:12.602
My Rottweiler Les is of the homosexual orientation.

1033
00:54:13.648 --> 00:54:16.446
I've said it. I'm out.

1034
00:54:16.518 --> 00:54:18.952
My name is Stan Marks, I'm a conservative Republican...

1035
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.079
NRA spokesman, and my dog is gay.

1036
00:54:21.156 --> 00:54:23.420
And guess what?

1037
00:54:23.491 --> 00:54:26.585
I couldn't be prouder of the little flamer!

1038
00:54:26.661 --> 00:54:28.959
I don't care how good my hair looks...

1039
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:31.225
slicked back with some high-dollar pomade.

1040
00:54:31.299 --> 00:54:35.133
Just one long stare into that sweet sissy dog's eyes...

1041
00:54:35.203 --> 00:54:40.266
and I know no cosmetic could ever be worth it!

1042
00:54:40.342 --> 00:54:44.779
Bruiser's Bill.

1043
00:54:44.846 --> 00:54:46.575
Bruiser's Bill!

1044
00:54:49.317 --> 00:54:51.285
We did it! Bill passing!

1045
00:54:51.353 --> 00:54:53.981
Bruiser's Bill!

1046
00:54:54.055 --> 00:54:56.080
Important legislation for our time.

1047
00:55:06.868 --> 00:55:09.132
Bruiser, good work, little guy.

1048
00:55:14.409 --> 00:55:16.138
I would like to conclude this hearing...

1049
00:55:16.211 --> 00:55:18.042
by thanking you all for your testimony--

1050
00:55:18.113 --> 00:55:19.478
Mr. Chairman, sir...

1051
00:55:19.547 --> 00:55:20.707
The chair recognizes...

1052
00:55:20.782 --> 00:55:22.409
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.

1053
00:55:22.484 --> 00:55:24.748
Mr. Chairman, committee members...

1054
00:55:24.819 --> 00:55:28.346
I would like to thank you for your consideration of this bill.

1055
00:55:28.423 --> 00:55:31.221
However, after further reflection...

1056
00:55:31.292 --> 00:55:34.420
on the budgetary realities of this fiscal year...

1057
00:55:34.496 --> 00:55:37.954
I feel I must withdraw my support for Bruiser's Bill.

1058
00:55:38.032 --> 00:55:40.694
-What? -I concur!

1059
00:55:53.014 --> 00:55:54.982
Everybody, calm down.

1060
00:56:04.259 --> 00:56:06.090
I'm sorry, Bruiser.

1061
00:56:07.862 --> 00:56:10.194
I'm sorry, too, Elle.

1062
00:56:10.265 --> 00:56:12.529
I know you think I've let you down.

1063
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.068
Believe me, I thought about your reaction...

1064
00:56:15.136 --> 00:56:17.161
maybe more than I should have.

1065
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.636
You were outmaneuvered...

1066
00:56:21.709 --> 00:56:23.574
by Grace.

1067
00:56:23.645 --> 00:56:25.408
Grace?

1068
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.914
For the last two sessions she's been pushing...

1069
00:56:27.982 --> 00:56:30.109
this homeowners incentives bill.

1070
00:56:30.185 --> 00:56:32.312
This morning she struck a deal.

1071
00:56:32.387 --> 00:56:36.255
I withdraw my support for Bruiser's Bill.

1072
00:56:36.324 --> 00:56:39.953
Homeowners incentives comes to a vote.

1073
00:56:40.028 --> 00:56:42.019
That was the price and I paid it.

1074
00:56:42.096 --> 00:56:46.192
That's all just deals and trades and secrets.

1075
00:56:49.904 --> 00:56:52.930
That's not what people want.

1076
00:57:01.316 --> 00:57:05.013
Elle...I'm sorry.

1077
00:57:13.795 --> 00:57:15.729
Government of the people...

1078
00:57:15.797 --> 00:57:19.164
by the people, for the people.

1079
00:57:44.158 --> 00:57:47.025
So what's your story?

1080
00:57:47.095 --> 00:57:49.586
Were you even honest?

1081
00:57:50.965 --> 00:57:52.933
I guess you were.

1082
00:57:56.571 --> 00:57:57.799
If you didn't play games...

1083
00:57:57.872 --> 00:58:01.171
then you were probably the only one.

1084
00:58:03.845 --> 00:58:06.575
I just don't know how you did it.

1085
00:58:06.648 --> 00:58:08.980
I don't even mean wearing that silly hat...

1086
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:10.984
because that was really brave.

1087
00:58:11.052 --> 00:58:13.179
But...

1088
00:58:13.254 --> 00:58:16.189
Just trusting your country.

1089
00:58:16.257 --> 00:58:18.817
Trusting this system...

1090
00:58:21.996 --> 00:58:24.260
Trusting yourself.

1091
00:58:24.332 --> 00:58:26.493
I did.

1092
00:58:41.416 --> 00:58:44.476
Go on. It's full of warm fuzzies.

1093
00:58:44.552 --> 00:58:47.350
With extra fuzz.

1094
00:58:59.634 --> 00:59:02.762
"Elle Woods has amazing lateral delts."

1095
00:59:02.837 --> 00:59:05.738
That was my target muscle group of the month.

1096
00:59:05.807 --> 00:59:08.674
Snaps for Elle's lateral delts.

1097
00:59:24.459 --> 00:59:26.757
"Elle Woods inspires us."

1098
00:59:28.997 --> 00:59:30.794
We even put little hearts over the "ls".

1099
00:59:30.865 --> 00:59:33.857
-I see that. -lt was my idea.

1100
00:59:33.935 --> 00:59:36.062
Thank you, Timothy.

1101
00:59:36.137 --> 00:59:38.605
Thank you, everybody. This is really nice.

1102
00:59:38.673 --> 00:59:42.336
But I just don't think I'm cut out for this.

1103
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:43.536
Elle, we have a plan.

1104
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:46.239
Two words for you-- Discharge petition.

1105
00:59:46.314 --> 00:59:48.111
With a couple hundred signatures...

1106
00:59:48.182 --> 00:59:50.116
we can spring Bruiser's Bill from committee...

1107
00:59:50.184 --> 00:59:52.414
straight to the House floor for a vote.

1108
00:59:52.487 --> 00:59:55.854
I don't know. That sounds really complicated.

1109
00:59:55.923 --> 00:59:57.356
You've come farther than any of us...

1110
00:59:57.425 --> 00:59:59.552
while maintaining your bounce and sparkle.

1111
00:59:59.627 --> 01:00:01.288
We never sparkle.

1112
01:00:01.362 --> 01:00:04.456
None of us thought one person could make a difference...

1113
01:00:04.532 --> 01:00:06.693
until you came along.

1114
01:00:08.102 --> 01:00:11.799
If I remember correctly, isn't that 218 signatures?

1115
01:00:11.873 --> 01:00:14.273
It's not that hard.

1116
01:00:14.342 --> 01:00:16.810
Yeah.

1117
01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:19.272
Yeah.

1118
01:00:20.448 --> 01:00:22.643
I guess I know women with more shoes than that.

1119
01:00:22.717 --> 01:00:25.914
Wait, that's me.

1120
01:00:25.987 --> 01:00:27.887
Elle...

1121
01:00:27.955 --> 01:00:30.617
it's time to finish what you started.

1122
01:00:34.462 --> 01:00:36.259
OK, people, a lot on the agenda today.

1123
01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:39.265
Reenie, I'm still waiting on those one-minute floor speeches.

1124
01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:43.326
Timothy, I need recon on that campaign finance reform hearing.

1125
01:00:43.404 --> 01:00:46.100
Grace, status meeting in my office right away.

1126
01:00:49.544 --> 01:00:53.036
I said now.

1127
01:00:57.018 --> 01:00:58.212
Where's my staff?

1128
01:00:58.286 --> 01:01:01.414
They quit, without notice.

1129
01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:03.548
Why?

1130
01:01:05.026 --> 01:01:07.961
Marks and Hauser just filed a petition...

1131
01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:09.428
to discharge Bruiser's Bill.

1132
01:01:09.497 --> 01:01:11.761
I'm pretty sure that's where your staff is...

1133
01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:14.529
Ied by their commander Sorority Sue.

1134
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:23.143
Petition to discharge HR 2652, aka Bruiser's Bill...

1135
01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:25.179
carried with no objections.

1136
01:01:25.246 --> 01:01:29.205
The petition is filed and available for signature.

1137
01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:32.713
Actually, we are strictly...

1138
01:01:32.787 --> 01:01:36.188
"bring your own" on the discharge petition.

1139
01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:46.658
But it's pink...and scented.

1140
01:01:46.734 --> 01:01:50.135
Gives it something extra, don't you think?

1141
01:01:50.204 --> 01:01:52.695
We've both signed it, as you can see.

1142
01:01:53.941 --> 01:01:56.205
I believe we're being dismissed. Thank you.

1143
01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:58.472
There will be others to come and sign.

1144
01:01:58.546 --> 01:02:00.639
-Don't you like pink? -Come on!

1145
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:18.599
Up on your feet, people.

1146
01:02:18.666 --> 01:02:21.430
Discharge petition time.

1147
01:02:21.502 --> 01:02:22.901
Upsy-daisy.

1148
01:02:25.339 --> 01:02:28.103
We have our work cut out for us. Let's go.

1149
01:02:30.511 --> 01:02:33.947
OK, we have two signatures. 216 to go.

1150
01:02:34.015 --> 01:02:35.505
I'll break up the country into color codes.

1151
01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:37.517
Timothy, you're teal.

1152
01:02:37.585 --> 01:02:39.780
Reena, you're magenta.

1153
01:02:39.854 --> 01:02:42.118
And Elle is marigold.

1154
01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:43.680
And I've got the Wellington covered.

1155
01:02:43.758 --> 01:02:45.555
37 signatures in residence.

1156
01:02:45.626 --> 01:02:48.322
Sid Post, 37.

1157
01:02:48.396 --> 01:02:51.388
Congress adjourns in 3 weeks. We can't do this alone.

1158
01:02:51.465 --> 01:02:53.399
That's why I'm calling in reinforcements.

1159
01:02:53.467 --> 01:02:54.729
I hope we're talking...

1160
01:02:54.802 --> 01:02:57.134
the brightest political minds in the country.

1161
01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.235
We're here!

1162
01:03:06.814 --> 01:03:08.406
Oh, my God!

1163
01:03:10.885 --> 01:03:13.217
Oh, gosh, we can't wait to see the Mall.

1164
01:03:13.287 --> 01:03:14.811
And the Statue of Liberty.

1165
01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:17.289
Everybody, these are my Delta Nu sisters.

1166
01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:18.950
This is Margot and Serena.

1167
01:03:19.026 --> 01:03:22.587
Josh made the cruise boat pull over in Puerto Vallarta.

1168
01:03:22.663 --> 01:03:23.994
I left L.A. right after landing...

1169
01:03:24.065 --> 01:03:26.693
a lateral split in the third quarter dance break.

1170
01:03:26.767 --> 01:03:29.497
It was awesome. I went "Yah!" and "Haah!"

1171
01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:32.061
-That's so great. -Yeah, thanks.

1172
01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:34.664
So, is it time?

1173
01:03:34.742 --> 01:03:36.937
Oh, no, it's not time yet.

1174
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:44.113
Hello? You're here?

1175
01:03:44.185 --> 01:03:47.177
We'll meet you in the lobby. Let's go.

1176
01:03:50.591 --> 01:03:52.650
Everybody, this is the final member of our team...

1177
01:03:52.727 --> 01:03:53.853
Paulette Parcelle.

1178
01:03:53.928 --> 01:03:56.897
Who's ready to discharge?

1179
01:03:56.964 --> 01:04:01.628
And proposition a bill and...whatever.

1180
01:04:01.702 --> 01:04:03.829
Let's hit the Hill.

1181
01:04:05.072 --> 01:04:07.597
If I could have a moment of your time--

1182
01:04:07.675 --> 01:04:10.576
You could consider something--

1183
01:04:10.645 --> 01:04:13.443
Quadrant 4, corridor 6, have lost one.

1184
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:18.341
Sorry. How are you?

1185
01:04:18.419 --> 01:04:19.647
If I could have a minute of your time?

1186
01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:21.654
Reena, how are you?

1187
01:04:21.722 --> 01:04:23.212
Has anybody told you about Bruiser's Bill?

1188
01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:24.952
Is it trivial, Congressman Hannenfeld?

1189
01:04:25.026 --> 01:04:27.017
Animals don't have the same reactions...

1190
01:04:27.094 --> 01:04:28.220
to drugs that humans do.

1191
01:04:28.296 --> 01:04:29.422
It's like the time...

1192
01:04:29.497 --> 01:04:31.021
my trainer's sister's cousin's girlfriend...

1193
01:04:31.098 --> 01:04:32.622
gave her overweight Yorkie some phen-fen...

1194
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.292
because she was a little bit fat...

1195
01:04:34.368 --> 01:04:35.767
and it gained three pounds.

1196
01:04:35.836 --> 01:04:38.270
Desired result? I don't think so.

1197
01:04:38.339 --> 01:04:40.466
You know?

1198
01:04:42.243 --> 01:04:44.837
Oh, my dear, gifted woman...

1199
01:04:44.912 --> 01:04:46.174
you tell that Bruiser Woods...

1200
01:04:46.247 --> 01:04:48.909
he can count on the Sunshine State.

1201
01:04:48.983 --> 01:04:51.144
Thank you, Ohio.

1202
01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:03.125
Thank you, Atlanta!

1203
01:05:03.197 --> 01:05:04.994
Who's next?

1204
01:05:05.066 --> 01:05:06.556
You're next!

1205
01:05:09.103 --> 01:05:11.537
We're gonna do it.

1206
01:05:17.745 --> 01:05:19.212
Serena...

1207
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.545
why do they keep sending us to Room 216?

1208
01:05:22.616 --> 01:05:25.585
"lntern Orientation."

1209
01:05:27.021 --> 01:05:29.114
Margot, you're a genius.

1210
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:30.657
If this doesn't get more signatures...

1211
01:05:30.725 --> 01:05:31.885
I don't know what will.

1212
01:05:34.328 --> 01:05:37.229
Intern class of 2003 on deck!

1213
01:05:43.371 --> 01:05:45.703
Remember, flexibility counts.

1214
01:05:49.377 --> 01:05:51.937
Ready? OK!

1215
01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.205
Dogs of the world unite!

1216
01:06:21.142 --> 01:06:22.803
2...4...6...8!

1217
01:06:22.877 --> 01:06:25.175
Sign the petition, win a date!

1218
01:06:25.246 --> 01:06:28.147
Go Bruiser's Bill, go!

1219
01:06:30.751 --> 01:06:32.275
Well, I'm signing.

1220
01:06:34.155 --> 01:06:37.181
Yes, Bob, I know what you're reading.

1221
01:06:37.258 --> 01:06:40.056
Are you kidding?

1222
01:06:40.127 --> 01:06:43.096
Your support has been invaluable to me.

1223
01:06:43.164 --> 01:06:45.894
If it weren't for you, I'd be painting my own posters.

1224
01:06:45.966 --> 01:06:49.231
I don't care if she has two weeks left.

1225
01:06:49.303 --> 01:06:50.998
She could have two years left.

1226
01:06:51.072 --> 01:06:52.630
She won't pull this off.

1227
01:06:52.706 --> 01:06:58.144
I will not be outmaneuvered by this silly little blonde.

1228
01:06:59.914 --> 01:07:02.439
Don't worry, Bob. I'll get her...

1229
01:07:02.516 --> 01:07:04.711
and her little dog, too.

1230
01:07:06.253 --> 01:07:07.982
Even with the entire Wellington...

1231
01:07:08.055 --> 01:07:10.683
and 68 life-changing haircuts under Paulette's belt...

1232
01:07:10.758 --> 01:07:11.884
we're still not even close.

1233
01:07:11.959 --> 01:07:13.688
We got a problem here.

1234
01:07:13.761 --> 01:07:16.924
The bad news is...

1235
01:07:16.997 --> 01:07:18.965
Reena.

1236
01:07:27.942 --> 01:07:32.072
Wow. You look amazing.

1237
01:07:32.146 --> 01:07:35.081
It's just layers and highlights...

1238
01:07:35.149 --> 01:07:36.707
and a cellulose finishing rinse.

1239
01:07:36.784 --> 01:07:38.649
I did it.

1240
01:07:38.719 --> 01:07:40.744
Cool.

1241
01:07:40.821 --> 01:07:42.482
What is the bad news?

1242
01:07:42.556 --> 01:07:45.525
We lost Hannenfeld. We were planning on him...

1243
01:07:45.593 --> 01:07:47.993
to bring Felsen, Parks, and Janowitz on board.

1244
01:07:48.062 --> 01:07:50.155
What are you talking about? I talked to Hannenfeld myself.

1245
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:52.699
I confirmed with his aide this morning over breakfast.

1246
01:07:52.766 --> 01:07:55.894
I don't know. Somebody must've got to him at lunch.

1247
01:07:56.937 --> 01:07:58.370
It's Grace.

1248
01:07:58.439 --> 01:08:01.033
-Please make sure. -I will. Two weeks?

1249
01:08:01.108 --> 01:08:02.871
I'm looking for Grace Rossiter.

1250
01:08:02.943 --> 01:08:05.707
I just want to know if she's coming back soon.

1251
01:08:05.779 --> 01:08:07.906
Elle. Hi.

1252
01:08:07.982 --> 01:08:09.210
Oh, hi.

1253
01:08:09.283 --> 01:08:11.444
I was going to call you.

1254
01:08:11.519 --> 01:08:14.215
I was looking for Grace.

1255
01:08:14.288 --> 01:08:15.880
The discharge petition.

1256
01:08:15.956 --> 01:08:17.685
We lost Hannenfeld...

1257
01:08:17.758 --> 01:08:19.783
and I was wondering if Grace knew anything about it.

1258
01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.987
None of that is important anymore.

1259
01:08:22.062 --> 01:08:24.462
Could I speak with you for a moment?

1260
01:08:24.532 --> 01:08:26.363
Sure.

1261
01:08:33.607 --> 01:08:35.939
You did it, Elle. You won.

1262
01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:38.808
You can collect Bruiser's mom anytime you like.

1263
01:08:38.879 --> 01:08:40.244
What?

1264
01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:43.112
If you promise not to be disappointed in me again...

1265
01:08:43.184 --> 01:08:46.551
I'll tell you. I pulled a few strings.

1266
01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:51.057
C'est Magnifique is releasing all of their test animals.

1267
01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:52.615
All of them?

1268
01:08:52.693 --> 01:08:54.490
All of them. And what's more...

1269
01:08:54.562 --> 01:08:55.893
they have been so impressed...

1270
01:08:55.963 --> 01:08:58.261
with how you've handled yourself down here...

1271
01:08:58.332 --> 01:09:02.268
they want you on board as head of their legal department.

1272
01:09:02.336 --> 01:09:03.769
It's a very generous offer.

1273
01:09:03.837 --> 01:09:06.101
I don't know.

1274
01:09:06.173 --> 01:09:07.640
You did it.

1275
01:09:07.708 --> 01:09:10.268
You did what you came here to do.

1276
01:09:10.344 --> 01:09:13.211
Yeah, but what about the discharge petition?

1277
01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.373
This isn't about just one animal...

1278
01:09:15.449 --> 01:09:16.575
it's all of the animals.

1279
01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:19.312
I agree, but you've got a great team in place.

1280
01:09:19.386 --> 01:09:20.910
They can carry on without you.

1281
01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:23.650
C'est Magnifique wants you up there by Monday.

1282
01:09:23.724 --> 01:09:26.989
You can go home.

1283
01:09:27.061 --> 01:09:29.655
Congratulations, Elle.

1284
01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:31.891
Wow. Thank you. Thanks for doing that.

1285
01:09:31.966 --> 01:09:33.831
Well, sure.

1286
01:09:36.937 --> 01:09:40.338
We have to stick together, us Washington blondes.

1287
01:09:40.407 --> 01:09:43.171
Do you know who Representative Hannenfeld...

1288
01:09:43.244 --> 01:09:45.872
had lunch with today in the members dining room?

1289
01:09:47.248 --> 01:09:50.149
I skipped lunch today. Had a facial.

1290
01:09:50.217 --> 01:09:52.685
OK. Thanks.

1291
01:09:52.753 --> 01:09:54.812
I'll call you about that.

1292
01:09:54.888 --> 01:09:56.378
Yeah.

1293
01:10:07.501 --> 01:10:10.163
Emmett, I know you're probably in Case Law class right now...

1294
01:10:10.237 --> 01:10:12.228
but call me back when you get this.

1295
01:10:12.306 --> 01:10:14.638
I think I'm coming home.

1296
01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:16.573
But it's a good thing.

1297
01:10:16.644 --> 01:10:19.807
Maybe. Call me back.

1298
01:10:32.059 --> 01:10:33.993
Will you leave us alone now?

1299
01:10:34.061 --> 01:10:35.653
Excuse me?

1300
01:10:35.729 --> 01:10:37.720
I know you've been working against us...

1301
01:10:37.798 --> 01:10:39.060
and I know somehow it's personal.

1302
01:10:39.133 --> 01:10:41.567
-You don't like me. -Clearly.

1303
01:10:41.635 --> 01:10:45.264
If I leave Washington, will you call off the fight...

1304
01:10:45.339 --> 01:10:46.806
and let Bruiser's Bill have a fair shot?

1305
01:10:46.874 --> 01:10:50.332
Your bill is trivial to me. I have my own agenda.

1306
01:10:50.411 --> 01:10:53.812
Like the homeowners bill you pushed through at our expense?

1307
01:10:53.881 --> 01:10:55.508
That's all I'm asking, Grace--

1308
01:10:55.582 --> 01:10:58.415
Homeowners incentives? I wouldn't touch that bill.

1309
01:10:58.485 --> 01:11:00.919
It's a tax break for the wealthy.

1310
01:11:02.823 --> 01:11:06.281
Haven't you been pushing it for the last two sessions?

1311
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.227
Victoria has a live interview with Connie Chung in an hour.

1312
01:11:09.296 --> 01:11:11.560
I don't have time for this.

1313
01:11:11.632 --> 01:11:14.066
That's the interview she's preparing for?

1314
01:11:14.134 --> 01:11:16.602
She's in makeup right now.

1315
01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:18.638
She's in makeup?

1316
01:11:18.772 --> 01:11:20.706
Mike test, 1-2-3.

1317
01:11:20.774 --> 01:11:22.207
Is Miss Chung available?

1318
01:11:22.276 --> 01:11:23.834
I'd like to go over some ground rules

1319
01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:26.846
before we go on live, for goodness sakes.

1320
01:11:26.914 --> 01:11:29.280
Yes, OK. Thanks.

1321
01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:33.048
Doesn't she have a beautiful complexion?

1322
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.987
She's like a PSA for SPF.

1323
01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:38.456
Thank you, Elle. I thought you were gone.

1324
01:11:38.525 --> 01:11:40.390
Home? No, no, no. I'm not ready yet--

1325
01:11:40.461 --> 01:11:41.928
Epidermally speaking, that is.

1326
01:11:41.995 --> 01:11:44.054
I'm actually feeling a little bit muddy.

1327
01:11:44.131 --> 01:11:45.792
I need a light exfoliation...

1328
01:11:45.866 --> 01:11:47.128
followed by super rich hydration...

1329
01:11:47.201 --> 01:11:50.068
and I thought, Victoria will have a good recommendation.

1330
01:11:50.137 --> 01:11:52.332
Sweetie, this really isn't the best time.

1331
01:11:52.406 --> 01:11:53.805
I know you're very busy...

1332
01:11:53.874 --> 01:11:55.808
so I already called your facialist.

1333
01:11:55.876 --> 01:11:58.811
The thing is she said you didn't come in today.

1334
01:11:58.879 --> 01:12:01.677
Oh, no, no. I went someplace else.

1335
01:12:01.749 --> 01:12:03.239
Someplace new. Is that all?

1336
01:12:03.317 --> 01:12:04.443
No, that's not all.

1337
01:12:04.518 --> 01:12:07.146
Every woman knows that a good facial...

1338
01:12:07.221 --> 01:12:09.553
can be a painful experience if done properly...

1339
01:12:09.623 --> 01:12:13.059
resulting in red blotchy areas all over your skin...

1340
01:12:13.127 --> 01:12:15.823
swelling, tenderness in your T-zone area.

1341
01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:18.626
Even more so if your facialist is Eastern European...

1342
01:12:18.699 --> 01:12:20.223
as so many of the best are.

1343
01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.427
Payback for the fall of Communism, I like to say.

1344
01:12:22.503 --> 01:12:24.994
What on earth are you talking about?

1345
01:12:25.072 --> 01:12:26.596
Isn't it the first rule of facials...

1346
01:12:26.673 --> 01:12:28.436
that there's a 24-hour window between a facial...

1347
01:12:28.509 --> 01:12:31.376
and any major occasion such as a date or a dance...

1348
01:12:31.445 --> 01:12:34.312
or maybe an interview with Mrs. Maury Povich?

1349
01:12:34.381 --> 01:12:36.281
I don't think that's a rule...

1350
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.648
the most well-groomed woman in Washington would forget.

1351
01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:41.051
This is ridiculous. Could we clear this room?

1352
01:12:41.121 --> 01:12:42.520
You lied to me about your lunch hour.

1353
01:12:42.589 --> 01:12:45.581
Why? Because you were having lunch with Hannenfeld?

1354
01:12:45.659 --> 01:12:48.856
You've been lobbying against us all this time.

1355
01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:54.196
For God's sakes, enough. Thank you. Out, out, out.

1356
01:12:54.268 --> 01:12:57.135
Thank you. I'll be with you in a moment.

1357
01:13:00.207 --> 01:13:04.610
Yes. I lied to you. I killed Bruiser's Bill.

1358
01:13:04.678 --> 01:13:05.872
But you're an animal lover.

1359
01:13:05.946 --> 01:13:07.743
What about Dolly Madison, your beagle?

1360
01:13:07.815 --> 01:13:09.874
Not mine. I borrowed it.

1361
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:12.783
And it reeked. Looked good on the sofa.

1362
01:13:12.853 --> 01:13:15.788
We've been through all of this before.

1363
01:13:15.856 --> 01:13:18.347
I traded your bill for the homeowners bill...

1364
01:13:18.425 --> 01:13:20.052
that Grace had committed me to.

1365
01:13:20.127 --> 01:13:22.823
That's a lie. Grace never wanted that.

1366
01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:26.195
You blocked this bill and I want to know why.

1367
01:13:26.266 --> 01:13:27.756
-Why? -Yes, why?

1368
01:13:27.835 --> 01:13:31.100
Why does anything happen in Washington? Survival.

1369
01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:34.231
You have no idea what it takes to get here and stay here.

1370
01:13:34.308 --> 01:13:35.832
The money it takes.

1371
01:13:35.909 --> 01:13:39.401
It just so happens that my chief financial contributor

1372
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.847
purchased half share in a major cosmetics company...

1373
01:13:42.916 --> 01:13:46.579
and they want to continue testing on animals...

1374
01:13:46.653 --> 01:13:48.211
so much so that they're willing...

1375
01:13:48.288 --> 01:13:50.449
to bankroll my opponent in next year's elections...

1376
01:13:50.524 --> 01:13:53.789
if I did not kill your bill.

1377
01:13:53.861 --> 01:13:55.886
I trusted you.

1378
01:13:55.963 --> 01:13:58.090
I looked up to you.

1379
01:13:58.165 --> 01:14:02.397
I can't do anyone any good if I'm no longer here.

1380
01:14:02.469 --> 01:14:04.699
But you're not doing anybody any good.

1381
01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:08.798
Nobody in your district, not even yourself.

1382
01:14:08.876 --> 01:14:12.437
And I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.

1383
01:14:16.416 --> 01:14:18.850
You can't prove why I changed my vote...

1384
01:14:18.919 --> 01:14:20.216
or how I blocked your bill.

1385
01:14:20.287 --> 01:14:22.380
It's your word against mine...

1386
01:14:22.456 --> 01:14:24.947
and I've spent 20 years building up my credibility...

1387
01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:26.822
in this town and back home.

1388
01:14:26.894 --> 01:14:28.759
I'm not going to the press.

1389
01:14:28.829 --> 01:14:31.764
I don't believe in blackmail.

1390
01:14:31.832 --> 01:14:33.891
But I do believe in the people...

1391
01:14:33.967 --> 01:14:36.333
and I'm going to take Bruiser's Bill to them.

1392
01:14:36.403 --> 01:14:38.667
The people believe what we tell them to believe.

1393
01:14:38.739 --> 01:14:40.172
It'll never work, Elle.

1394
01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.004
You can't get the people to care.

1395
01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.145
Watch me.

1396
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.664
Ladies...

1397
01:15:08.735 --> 01:15:10.225
it's time.

1398
01:15:12.339 --> 01:15:14.000
You mean...

1399
01:15:14.074 --> 01:15:15.632
Are you sure?

1400
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:19.440
As sure as I am that nobody looks good in paisley.

1401
01:15:19.513 --> 01:15:21.811
Are you with me?

1402
01:15:21.882 --> 01:15:25.716
I think so. Serena?

1403
01:15:28.155 --> 01:15:31.784
Yeah. Yes. We're with you, Elle.

1404
01:15:32.893 --> 01:15:34.326
Go for it.

1405
01:15:48.976 --> 01:15:50.443
Oh, my God!

1406
01:15:55.716 --> 01:15:58.116
Delta Nu president, Chapter 2-6...

1407
01:15:58.185 --> 01:16:02.417
I.D. Number 097435. Third from the top.

1408
01:16:02.489 --> 01:16:05.253
6234978, fifth from the top...

1409
01:16:05.325 --> 01:16:07.919
calling to activate phone tree number 255.

1410
01:16:07.995 --> 01:16:10.486
Call to activate phone tree 255!

1411
01:16:10.564 --> 01:16:11.997
This is not a fire drill.

1412
01:16:12.065 --> 01:16:14.499
I repeat, this is not a drill!

1413
01:16:18.005 --> 01:16:21.634
Sisters mobilized. E.T.A. 0800 hours.

1414
01:16:27.648 --> 01:16:29.479
-Hi, Heather, it's Buffy. -Hi, Kiki, it's Tiffani.

1415
01:16:29.549 --> 01:16:31.608
-Hi, Amber, it's Becky. -Hi, Audrey, it's Melanie.

1416
01:16:31.685 --> 01:16:33.550
-Hi, Jos, it's Breena. -Hi, Courtney, it's Veronica.

1417
01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.451
-Hi, Christy, it's Nat. -Hi, Binky, it's Nicki.

1418
01:16:35.522 --> 01:16:38.457
-Hi, Jill, it's Jojo. -Hi, Allison, it's Cookie.

1419
01:16:38.525 --> 01:16:39.890
You will never believe what happened.

1420
01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.222
Elle just called and she needs our help...

1421
01:16:41.294 --> 01:16:43.091
Suzy, we're taking it to Defcon One.

1422
01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:44.323
There's a crisis right now.

1423
01:16:44.398 --> 01:16:46.093
Where the president is. Exactly.

1424
01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:48.361
There's an emergency in Washington.

1425
01:16:48.435 --> 01:16:50.300
Road trip?

1426
01:16:54.441 --> 01:16:57.342
OK, see you in Washington.

1427
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:33.573
Save Bruiser's mom!

1428
01:17:33.647 --> 01:17:35.274
Save Bruiser's mom!

1429
01:17:35.348 --> 01:17:36.906
Help me out, tell a friend.

1430
01:17:36.983 --> 01:17:40.475
Save Bruiser's mom!

1431
01:17:40.554 --> 01:17:41.953
I like your necklace.

1432
01:17:56.636 --> 01:17:59.833
Gay Dogs of America support Bruiser's Bill!

1433
01:17:59.906 --> 01:18:01.339
We're gonna tee it around 12:00--

1434
01:18:01.408 --> 01:18:03.603
Miss, save me a good one.

1435
01:18:03.677 --> 01:18:05.872
Full-color big picture of Bruiser.

1436
01:18:05.946 --> 01:18:08.437
Emmett! What are you doing here?

1437
01:18:08.515 --> 01:18:10.415
Wedding research.

1438
01:18:10.484 --> 01:18:11.712
What?

1439
01:18:11.785 --> 01:18:15.516
Elle, your work is here now and it's important.

1440
01:18:15.589 --> 01:18:17.648
So I'm bringing the wedding to you.

1441
01:18:17.724 --> 01:18:20.693
First step, get groom to Washington.

1442
01:18:22.162 --> 01:18:23.789
But what about Fenway Park?

1443
01:18:25.398 --> 01:18:27.525
Look, I don't care where I marry you...

1444
01:18:27.601 --> 01:18:29.330
just as long as I do.

1445
01:18:29.402 --> 01:18:32.929
I do. I do. Feels good.

1446
01:18:34.007 --> 01:18:35.804
So what's Step Two?

1447
01:18:41.214 --> 01:18:43.512
That's Step Two.

1448
01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:47.075
Save Bruiser's mom!

1449
01:18:47.154 --> 01:18:50.954
Save Bruiser's mom!

1450
01:18:51.024 --> 01:18:54.687
Save Bruiser's mom!

1451
01:18:54.761 --> 01:18:56.991
Save Bruiser's mom!

1452
01:19:16.516 --> 01:19:19.212
Colorado. Photo ops after.

1453
01:19:19.286 --> 01:19:21.516
Grace, are you all right?

1454
01:19:21.588 --> 01:19:25.581
Save Bruiser's mom!

1455
01:19:25.659 --> 01:19:29.390
Save Bruiser's mom!

1456
01:19:29.462 --> 01:19:31.657
Save Bruiser's mom!

1457
01:19:51.718 --> 01:19:53.777
Rutherford. Check.

1458
01:19:53.854 --> 01:19:55.344
Porter. Check.

1459
01:19:55.422 --> 01:19:57.049
Hutchins. Check.

1460
01:19:58.959 --> 01:20:00.950
Uh-oh. That's it.

1461
01:20:01.027 --> 01:20:03.018
It's not enough.

1462
01:20:03.096 --> 01:20:04.256
Tomorrow's a wash.

1463
01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:05.923
It's National Education Day.

1464
01:20:07.567 --> 01:20:10.035
Got a meeting of both Houses, ceremonial speeches--

1465
01:20:10.103 --> 01:20:12.833
there's no time for politicking.

1466
01:20:12.906 --> 01:20:15.033
Sorry, Elle, we tried.

1467
01:20:15.108 --> 01:20:17.076
We have to keep trying.

1468
01:20:17.143 --> 01:20:18.371
Hello?

1469
01:20:18.445 --> 01:20:21.346
You want those last fifteen signatures?

1470
01:20:21.414 --> 01:20:22.574
Grace?

1471
01:20:22.649 --> 01:20:24.617
It'll take something extraordinary.

1472
01:20:24.684 --> 01:20:26.174
You'll have to pull something...

1473
01:20:26.253 --> 01:20:28.448
no regular citizen would ever dream of.

1474
01:20:28.521 --> 01:20:31.319
Fine, but how am l going to do that?

1475
01:20:31.391 --> 01:20:33.052
You're going to address the entire Congress...

1476
01:20:33.126 --> 01:20:34.991
and I know just the person to make it happen.

1477
01:20:35.061 --> 01:20:37.791
Who? Is that even possible?

1478
01:20:37.864 --> 01:20:41.800
Look, Elle, you may be above blackmail...

1479
01:20:41.868 --> 01:20:43.335
but I'm not.

1480
01:20:51.278 --> 01:20:53.405
Grace, why are you helping me?

1481
01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.472
Because once upon a time I loved politics...

1482
01:20:56.549 --> 01:20:58.517
and I want to do some good.

1483
01:20:59.519 --> 01:21:02.147
What has that got to do with me?

1484
01:21:02.222 --> 01:21:05.555
Look, those silly girls that I told you about...

1485
01:21:05.625 --> 01:21:08.093
with the blisters on their feet?

1486
01:21:08.161 --> 01:21:11.619
I was one of them.

1487
01:21:13.233 --> 01:21:16.464
We have celebrated today elementary education...

1488
01:21:16.536 --> 01:21:19.869
secondary and higher education...

1489
01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:24.138
and now...

1490
01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:26.235
Don't even think about it.

1491
01:21:26.313 --> 01:21:30.613
And now...

1492
01:21:30.684 --> 01:21:34.176
This is a little unconventional.

1493
01:21:34.254 --> 01:21:36.654
With the Speaker's...

1494
01:21:36.723 --> 01:21:40.124
and the president of the Senate's permission...

1495
01:21:40.193 --> 01:21:43.856
please indulge me as I share the floor...

1496
01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:45.989
with my constituent...

1497
01:21:46.066 --> 01:21:47.863
who in the spirit of education...

1498
01:21:47.934 --> 01:21:52.064
would like to educate us all on a vital issue...

1499
01:21:52.138 --> 01:21:54.003
facing us today.

1500
01:21:54.074 --> 01:21:57.407
Ladies and gentlemen of both Houses...

1501
01:21:57.477 --> 01:22:02.176
I give you Ms. Elle Woods.

1502
01:22:35.782 --> 01:22:37.682
It's all yours.

1503
01:22:42.122 --> 01:22:44.090
Thank you, Congresswoman.

1504
01:22:45.725 --> 01:22:48.125
Hello, everyone, my name is Elle Woods...

1505
01:22:48.194 --> 01:22:50.992
and I'm here to speak to you today...

1506
01:22:51.064 --> 01:22:54.761
about a piece of legislation called Bruiser's Bill.

1507
01:23:05.278 --> 01:23:07.838
But you know...

1508
01:23:07.914 --> 01:23:11.145
today is supposed to be about education.

1509
01:23:11.217 --> 01:23:15.654
So instead, I want to tell you about the education...

1510
01:23:15.722 --> 01:23:17.849
you all have given me over the past three months.

1511
01:23:17.924 --> 01:23:19.824
What about Bruiser's Bill? We still need 15 signatures.

1512
01:23:19.893 --> 01:23:21.121
She's blowing it.

1513
01:23:21.194 --> 01:23:24.186
I came to Washington to help my dog Bruiser...

1514
01:23:24.264 --> 01:23:25.697
and somewhere along the way...

1515
01:23:25.765 --> 01:23:29.667
I learned a really unexpected lesson.

1516
01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:34.235
I know what you're thinking-- Who is this girl?

1517
01:23:34.307 --> 01:23:37.572
And what could this simple, small-town girl from Bel Air...

1518
01:23:37.644 --> 01:23:40.772
have to say to all of us? I'll tell you.

1519
01:23:40.847 --> 01:23:45.113
It's about something that's bigger than me...

1520
01:23:45.185 --> 01:23:48.279
or any single act of legislation.

1521
01:23:48.354 --> 01:23:51.414
This is about a matter that should be at...

1522
01:23:51.491 --> 01:23:55.188
the highest importance to every American--

1523
01:23:56.329 --> 01:23:58.729
My hair.

1524
01:24:01.234 --> 01:24:02.667
There's this salon in Beverly Hills.

1525
01:24:02.735 --> 01:24:06.535
It's really fancy and beautiful.

1526
01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:08.540
It's impossible to get an appointment.

1527
01:24:08.608 --> 01:24:10.940
Unless you're Julia Roberts or from "Friends"...

1528
01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:12.671
you can just forget it.

1529
01:24:12.745 --> 01:24:16.545
But one day, they called me. They had an opening.

1530
01:24:16.616 --> 01:24:18.880
So I was going to finally get the chance...

1531
01:24:18.952 --> 01:24:21.079
to sit in one of those sacred beauty chairs.

1532
01:24:21.154 --> 01:24:23.145
I was so excited.

1533
01:24:23.223 --> 01:24:26.351
Then the colorist...

1534
01:24:26.426 --> 01:24:29.725
gave me Brassy Brigitte instead of Harlow Honey.

1535
01:24:29.796 --> 01:24:33.926
The shampoo girl washed my hair with spiral perm solution...

1536
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.992
instead of color-intensive moisturizing shampoo.

1537
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:40.267
Finally, the stylist...

1538
01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:44.538
gave me a bob...with bangs.

1539
01:24:45.578 --> 01:24:49.105
Suffice to say, it was just wrong.

1540
01:24:49.182 --> 01:24:53.778
All wrong. For me, you know?

1541
01:24:53.853 --> 01:24:55.218
First I was angry.

1542
01:24:55.288 --> 01:24:58.746
And then I realized my anger was completely misdirected.

1543
01:24:58.825 --> 01:25:00.884
This wasn't the salon's fault.

1544
01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.656
I had sat there and witnessed this injustice...

1545
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.425
and had let it happen.

1546
01:25:05.498 --> 01:25:10.265
I didn't get involved in the process.

1547
01:25:10.336 --> 01:25:14.067
I forgot to use my voice.

1548
01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:18.236
I forgot to believe in myself.

1549
01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:20.575
But now I know better.

1550
01:25:20.647 --> 01:25:26.711
I know that one honest voice can be louder than a crowd.

1551
01:25:26.786 --> 01:25:31.621
I know that if we lose our voice...

1552
01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:35.422
or if we let those who speak on our behalf...

1553
01:25:35.495 --> 01:25:38.123
compromise our voice...

1554
01:25:38.198 --> 01:25:42.362
then, this country...

1555
01:25:42.435 --> 01:25:45.199
this country is in for a really bad haircut.

1556
01:25:49.842 --> 01:25:52.174
So speak up, America.

1557
01:25:52.245 --> 01:25:53.803
Speak up!

1558
01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:57.281
Speak up for the home of the brave.

1559
01:25:57.350 --> 01:26:00.979
Speak up for the land of the free gift with purchase.

1560
01:26:01.054 --> 01:26:05.616
Speak up, America. Speak up!

1561
01:26:08.461 --> 01:26:10.395
And remember...

1562
01:26:10.463 --> 01:26:12.556
you are beautiful.

1563
01:26:16.469 --> 01:26:18.061
Thank you.

1564
01:26:31.884 --> 01:26:33.511
Thank you.

1565
01:26:33.586 --> 01:26:36.146
Everyone, it's time I spoke up.

1566
01:26:36.222 --> 01:26:38.520
I think Timothy's smoking!

1567
01:26:43.496 --> 01:26:46.021
I'm married.

1568
01:26:47.934 --> 01:26:49.231
Thank you.

1569
01:27:40.119 --> 01:27:43.850
You didn't! Thank you!

1570
01:27:43.923 --> 01:27:45.413
Thank you!

1571
01:27:48.461 --> 01:27:49.587
Thank you.

1572
01:27:49.662 --> 01:27:52.893
What is this? Oh, my God!

1573
01:27:54.167 --> 01:27:55.759
That's so perfect!

1574
01:28:21.794 --> 01:28:24.627
This week, Congresswoman Libby Hauser...

1575
01:28:24.697 --> 01:28:27.063
finished decorating her house...

1576
01:28:27.133 --> 01:28:29.067
sent her son off to college...

1577
01:28:29.135 --> 01:28:31.194
and negotiated a settlement...

1578
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:33.500
between the San Antonio labor unions...

1579
01:28:33.573 --> 01:28:35.803
and the Department of Sanitation.

1580
01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:38.503
Snaps for Congresswoman Hauser!

1581
01:29:25.925 --> 01:29:28.519
Now that we're married, where do you want to live?

1582
01:29:28.594 --> 01:29:31.222
Beverly Hills? Boston? Washington?

1583
01:29:31.297 --> 01:29:34.528
-I know just the place. -Yeah?
