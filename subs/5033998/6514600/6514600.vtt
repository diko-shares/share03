1
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.938
I think women can do anything.

2
00:00:55.073 --> 00:00:57.575
Well, I mean, just because they can,

3
00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.377
doesn't mean they should, right?

4
00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:04.382
Think about women fixing cars,

5
00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:06.384
driving a taxi,

6
00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:08.586
installing some drywall.

7
00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.720
Why not?

8
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:10.721
No.

9
00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:12.156
Look, trust me.

10
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.892
A girl like you,
you don't really want this.

11
00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:16.494
A girl like me?

12
00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:17.962
Mm-hm.

13
00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:20.098
I mean, I want
all my options available

14
00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:21.566
so I can decide for myself.

15
00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:24.369
Ah, Miss Independent.

16
00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:27.238
That's right.

17
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.506
That's me.

18
00:01:28.507 --> 00:01:29.640
I love it.

19
00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:32.209
Mm...

20
00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:33.395
Come here.

21
00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:34.446
Hm...

22
00:01:38.816 --> 00:01:41.352
Oh, mm...

23
00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:43.688
Except you're sitting here,

24
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:47.325
eating my food,
enjoying my view.

25
00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:48.825
By choice.

26
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.894
Mm, I chose you to join me.

27
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.132
I chose to make you notice me.

28
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.633
Ah, mm-mm.

29
00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:58.002
- That is not your choice, Sabina.
- Mm.

30
00:01:58.135 --> 00:01:59.637
That is God's gift to you.

31
00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:04.475
Gosh...

32
00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.111
But don't you think it's sort of

33
00:02:06.244 --> 00:02:09.880
what you do with those gifts
that really matters?

34
00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:11.248
Mmm.

35
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:12.450
- Every one of us.
- Mm?

36
00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:14.886
Men, women.

37
00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.986
We all just wanna
fulfill our potential,

38
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:18.856
live our heart's desires.

39
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.159
That's the kind of world
I wanna live in.

40
00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:23.160
Ah.

41
00:02:23.294 --> 00:02:26.764
Well, my world
is me making millions

42
00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:28.832
with you by my side.

43
00:02:30.568 --> 00:02:31.769
Hm?

44
00:02:31.903 --> 00:02:33.504
It's just that I'm so good

45
00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:35.639
at so many things.

46
00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:37.475
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:37.608 --> 00:02:39.277
Like what?

48
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.945
- Well...
- Hm?

49
00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:43.014
At my job,

50
00:02:43.147 --> 00:02:45.817
it's actually considered
a huge advantage to be a woman.

51
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.118
Hm.

52
00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:49.719
Yeah, if you're beautiful,

53
00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:52.123
nothing else
is really expected of you.

54
00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:53.524
And if you're not,

55
00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:55.860
you're pretty much
rendered invisible.

56
00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:58.579
And in my line of work,

57
00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.830
Mm...

58
00:02:59.964 --> 00:03:04.168
invisibility,
low expectations...

59
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:05.403
they come in very handy.

59b
00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:09.310
<i>Housewife, sounds like.</i>

48
00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.442
<i>Nothing wrong with being a housewife.</i>

49
00:03:13.821 --> 00:03:15.813
<i>Just not my choice.</i>

60
00:03:16.146 --> 00:03:17.648
I don't speak Portuguese.

61
00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.150
I know.

62
00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:26.591
Yeah, that's it.

63
00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:45.058
Sub By Black Hawk

64
00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.377
Did you know...

65
00:03:46.378 --> 00:03:47.645
What?

66
00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:49.880
That it takes men
an additional seven seconds

67
00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:52.582
to perceive a woman
as a threat compared to a man.

68
00:03:54.184 --> 00:03:55.553
Isn't that wild?

69
00:03:59.757 --> 00:04:01.192
- Who are you?
- Who, me?

70
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:05.896
I'm just the decoy, stud.

71
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:16.173
- How many?
- Nine!

72
00:04:16.307 --> 00:04:17.508
Send the lot.

73
00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.552
You stole aid money from women
and children and refugees!

74
00:04:28.686 --> 00:04:29.887
It's called embezzlement!

75
00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:34.125
"Embezzlement"?
That's fancy.

76
00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:43.401
You must be the accountant.

77
00:04:43.402 --> 00:04:44.969
Who are you?

78
00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:47.471
Open the safe.

79
00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:50.741
Oh, baby, baby,
you swiped right!

80
00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:52.576
I'm your girlfriend now!

81
00:04:54.445 --> 00:04:56.681
Everything on the bottom row.
Let's go.

82
00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.153
You're not cut out for this.
I recommend a new line of work.

83
00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:07.858
Bosley!

84
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:10.161
Evening, Angels.

85
00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:13.564
Well, all this looks
very promising.

86
00:05:13.697 --> 00:05:15.099
Outstanding.

87
00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.935
But what about Australian Jonny?

88
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.403
Ta-da!

89
00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:21.139
- Oh, you're gonna regret this.
- Yeah.

90
00:05:21.272 --> 00:05:22.740
I was gonna give you the world.

91
00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:24.942
The thing is, is you just talk
way too much.

92
00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.278
You're super clingy
and come on way too strong.

93
00:05:27.412 --> 00:05:28.879
You are the most
incredible woman

94
00:05:29.013 --> 00:05:30.815
- I've ever met.
- I know.

95
00:05:30.948 --> 00:05:33.551
So that's four months'
surveillance, two countries

96
00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:36.953
and the most embarrassing date
I have ever been on in my life.

97
00:05:37.088 --> 00:05:38.855
- Are we good?
- I will address this

98
00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:41.125
To the
U.S. Justice Department,

99
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:44.462
along with, uh,
all your new friends here.

100
00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:45.713
We're good to go.

101
00:05:45.714 --> 00:05:46.830
Sweet.

102
00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:49.166
I'm out of here, man.
I'm gonna take a week off,

103
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.868
party my ass off
on a Thai beach.

104
00:05:51.002 --> 00:05:52.470
Jane, you should give it a shot:

105
00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:54.972
beaches, letting someone
play with your, uh...

106
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.509
I have fun in my own ways.

107
00:05:58.642 --> 00:06:00.377
Oh. Cool.

108
00:06:00.511 --> 00:06:03.480
You sharpen
your samurai swords at night?

109
00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.048
Cosplay Catwoman?

110
00:06:05.182 --> 00:06:06.851
I'd actually pay to see that.

111
00:06:06.984 --> 00:06:08.986
Occasionally eat gluten
at night and feel...

112
00:06:10.488 --> 00:06:11.822
That was fun.

113
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.491
So who were they?

114
00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:17.028
You were in the presence
of Angels.

115
00:06:18.162 --> 00:06:20.198
But the question is, Jonny...

116
00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:24.235

Hey, Ingrid.

138
00:07:22.593 --> 00:07:24.528
You are late.
Mr. Fleming is waiting.

139
00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:26.297
Oh, wasn't the meeting
set for 9?

140
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.200
Yes, 9 a.m. is when
the meeting starts,

141
00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:31.768
which is exactly now.

142
00:07:31.902 --> 00:07:34.238
Have you ever spent time
with him? Mr. Brok?

143
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:35.472
No, of course not.

144
00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:36.974
He had me over to his château,

145
00:07:37.107 --> 00:07:38.508
which is in France.

146
00:07:38.643 --> 00:07:41.445
And we were sitting there,
and I'm asking him,

147
00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:45.881
I said, "Mr. Brok, have you
ever heard of Humphry Davy?"

148
00:07:46.016 --> 00:07:47.417
- And he says, "No."
- Oh.

149
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:49.887
I say, "Have you ever
heard of Joseph Swan

150
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.790
or Alexander Lodygin?"
"No clue."

151
00:07:52.923 --> 00:07:54.391
So I say, "Okay.

152
00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:57.127
Uh, what about
Thomas Edison?"

153
00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:00.297
"Well, of course. Who hasn't?
He invented the light bulb."

154
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:02.132
- Right? But guess what?
- Uh...

155
00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:04.101
So did those other three guys.

156
00:08:04.235 --> 00:08:05.803
Before Edison.

157
00:08:05.936 --> 00:08:08.638
But Edison was first to market.

158
00:08:08.772 --> 00:08:10.874
Do you see my point?

159
00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:12.977
We have a product that will

160
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.645
revolutionize
the power industry.

161
00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:17.448
But we have to be first.

162
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:19.182
The time is now.

163
00:08:19.316 --> 00:08:23.154
And that's what I told Mr. Brok,
and he agrees with me.

164
00:08:23.287 --> 00:08:24.855
Obviously.

165
00:08:24.989 --> 00:08:27.157
- I...
- Elena, thank you for coming in.

166
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:28.826
I love how
this conversation went.

167
00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.761
Technically, I haven't
said anything.

168
00:08:30.894 --> 00:08:33.130
Let's not get caught in
a game of who said what.

169
00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:35.632
Mr. Fleming, I know how
important Calisto is, okay?

170
00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:37.834
I'm the lead programmer on it.
It's my baby.

171
00:08:37.968 --> 00:08:39.502
- Yeah.
- But as I wrote in my report,

172
00:08:39.636 --> 00:08:41.070
Right now there is a possibility

173
00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:43.340
for the harmonic range
to be reversed.

174
00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:45.376
We both know how dangerous
that could be.

175
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:48.211
Well, I mean, you don't know
what I know. Heh.

176
00:08:48.345 --> 00:08:50.481
Y-you know Julio?
The second engineer?

177
00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:53.250
He's actually still in hospital
after a brain seizure,

178
00:08:53.384 --> 00:08:55.653
and he was only partially
exposed during a test.

179
00:08:55.786 --> 00:08:57.487
Allegedly. Allegedly.

180
00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:00.156
And Julio was an idiot.

181
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:01.858
All I need is root access

182
00:09:01.992 --> 00:09:03.661
and time
to permanently fix the flaw

183
00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:05.629
in the blockchain
so it will stay safe...

184
00:09:07.097 --> 00:09:09.467
Ingrid, can I get a cappuccino?

185
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.535
Okay. I read your report.

186
00:09:11.668 --> 00:09:15.339
I've had others
read your report.

187
00:09:15.473 --> 00:09:17.541
We just simply
disagree with you.

188
00:09:17.675 --> 00:09:20.510
Has Mr. Brok read my report?
I think that if he read...

189
00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:23.647
Let me be crystal clear here.

190
00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:25.849
We have developed Calisto
for five years,

191
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:27.718
and we are going to market.

192
00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:30.020
It is safe and it is ready,

193
00:09:30.154 --> 00:09:32.088
and that's what
we're telling Mr. Brok.

194
00:09:32.222 --> 00:09:35.893
And you are telling
Mr. Brok nothing.

195
00:09:38.595 --> 00:09:41.465
Look, Elena,
you're much too smart

196
00:09:41.598 --> 00:09:43.968
to keep pushing
this forward, aren't you?

197
00:09:47.872 --> 00:09:49.574
Good.

198
00:09:56.914 --> 00:09:58.282
I knew who Humphry Davy was.

199
00:09:58.283 --> 00:09:59.650
Good for you.

200
00:10:05.922 --> 00:10:07.241
You dropped something.

201
00:10:07.242 --> 00:10:08.559
Oh, no. That's not mine.

202
00:10:08.693 --> 00:10:11.696
Well, I don't litter,
so it must be yours.

203
00:10:13.563 --> 00:10:15.266
You might need it.

204
00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.661
Bosley, 001.

205
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.646
You old codger.
You really thought

206
00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:05.982
we were gonna let you
just sneak away quietly?

207
00:11:06.116 --> 00:11:07.550
You didn't have to.

208
00:11:07.684 --> 00:11:08.919
It's not just me.

209
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:12.690
<i>Surprise!</i>

210
00:11:12.823 --> 00:11:14.992
Surprise!

211
00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:16.460
Hey! Bonjour.

212
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:17.794
Buenos días, señor.

213
00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:19.013
Buenos días.

214
00:11:19.014 --> 00:11:20.097
Gang's all here.

215
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.100
We all wanted to wish you
a happy retirement.

216
00:11:23.233 --> 00:11:24.368
Thank you, Bosley.

217
00:11:24.502 --> 00:11:25.502
- And you, sir.
- Bosley.

218
00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.338
Bosley. Thank you.

219
00:11:27.471 --> 00:11:29.172
- You!
- You've had one hell of a run.

220
00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:30.774
It deserves to be celebrated.

221
00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:33.277
I even put together
a little walk down memory lane.

222
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.945
- Shall we? Ha, ha!
- Oh, no, no.

223
00:11:35.078 --> 00:11:36.947
Here it comes.

224
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.115
Oh, yeah! Ha, ha!

225
00:11:39.283 --> 00:11:40.568
Fresh-faced Oxford graduate.

226
00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:41.852
Yeah!

227
00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:44.154
- Oh, Lord.
- I dug deep. Look at that.

228
00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:45.823
That's not a disguise.

229
00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:48.191
You clearly had
a lot of fun over the years.

230
00:11:48.325 --> 00:11:50.327
You know, life was good
in those days.

231
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:51.928
Where did you get that suit?

232
00:11:52.062 --> 00:11:53.330
Monte Carlo.

233
00:11:53.464 --> 00:11:55.199
It really happened.
There's the proof.

234
00:11:57.301 --> 00:11:59.770
Well, when you opened
the European offices,

235
00:11:59.903 --> 00:12:02.172
you took the Townsend Agency
international.

236
00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:04.608
None of us would be here
without you.

237
00:12:04.741 --> 00:12:05.893
Yes.

238
00:12:05.894 --> 00:12:07.044
Especially me. Thank you.

239
00:12:07.177 --> 00:12:11.081
Well, I'm very touched.
Thank you. All of you.

240
00:12:11.215 --> 00:12:13.517
<i>- Say a few words. Come on, speech, Bosley.
- Speech!</i>

241
00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:14.785
Oh, no.

242
00:12:14.786 --> 00:12:15.919
Speech, speech, speech!

243
00:12:16.052 --> 00:12:18.689
Speech, speech, speech!

244
00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:19.890
Uh...

245
00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:24.027
Well, frankly, I am overwhelmed.

246
00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:28.498
I'm grateful...

247
00:12:28.632 --> 00:12:32.102
for all the work
that we have done together.

248
00:12:32.235 --> 00:12:34.938
And, you know,
Charlie wasn't sure

249
00:12:35.072 --> 00:12:36.873
that we could replicate
the success

250
00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.175
that he had here in California.

251
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.210
- But we made it work...
- That's right.

252
00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:45.982
in a world that was
really not ready for the Angels.

253
00:12:46.116 --> 00:12:48.285
For 40 years,

254
00:12:48.418 --> 00:12:50.488
I recruited them,
I trained them...

255
00:12:51.722 --> 00:12:53.424
and I'm so very proud of them.

256
00:12:54.925 --> 00:12:56.493
Bosleys...

257
00:12:56.627 --> 00:12:57.678
you keep them safe.

258
00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:58.728
Will do.

259
00:12:58.862 --> 00:12:59.913
Hear, hear.

260
00:12:59.914 --> 00:13:00.964
<i>We will, my friend.</i>

261
00:13:01.097 --> 00:13:04.300
And so for me, as Charlie said,

262
00:13:04.435 --> 00:13:06.469
time to make an exit stage left.

263
00:13:06.604 --> 00:13:09.239
Wha... Ah, speaking of Charlie...

264
00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:11.842
<i>Hello, Bosley.</i>

265
00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:13.476
Hello, Charlie.

266
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.946
<i>If you look around this room,
old friend,</i>

267
00:13:16.079 --> 00:13:17.479
<i>you'll see the men and women</i>

268
00:13:17.614 --> 00:13:20.250
<i>who will carry your legacy
into the future.</i>

269
00:13:20.384 --> 00:13:24.054
<i>Your leadership and commitment
is unparalleled.</i>

270
00:13:24.188 --> 00:13:26.891
<i>We owe you a debt
we cannot repay.</i>

271
00:13:27.024 --> 00:13:29.125
<i>So instead, we got you a watch.</i>

272
00:13:30.694 --> 00:13:32.329
- A watch?
- Yes.

273
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.865
Oh!

274
00:13:34.866 --> 00:13:36.100
Thank you, Charlie.

275
00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:38.502
<i>Enjoy your retirement.</i>

276
00:13:38.635 --> 00:13:40.170
<i>You deserve it.</i>

277
00:13:40.304 --> 00:13:42.472
A toast!

278
00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:44.475
You really like to party.

279
00:13:44.608 --> 00:13:47.209
It's the day drinking.
That's what I like the most.

280
00:13:47.344 --> 00:13:48.978
You're not bad either.

281
00:13:49.113 --> 00:13:50.781

Everyone, please help me
welcome our founder,

297
00:14:27.317 --> 00:14:30.120
our benefactor, Alexander Brok.

298
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.825
Mr. Brok, you have set

299
00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.296
the highest standards
for innovation.

300
00:14:39.429 --> 00:14:42.165
I believe that I, along
with a little help from my team,

301
00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:45.135
have met that challenge.

302
00:14:45.268 --> 00:14:48.605
Today, I instructed
the Hamburg power utility

303
00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:52.743
to disconnect this building
from the electrical grid.

304
00:14:52.876 --> 00:14:56.413
But we are far from powerless.

305
00:14:59.216 --> 00:15:00.417
Mr. Brok,

306
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.685
would you grant us root access?

307
00:15:04.188 --> 00:15:06.256
<i>Hello, Alexander.</i>

308
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.058
<i>Root access granted.</i>

309
00:15:08.192 --> 00:15:10.861
Calisto, turn on the lights.

310
00:15:12.863 --> 00:15:15.366
Calisto, pair
with sister devices.

311
00:15:18.001 --> 00:15:20.036
Calisto, full power.

312
00:15:27.845 --> 00:15:30.046
<i>Brok Industries can power the world.</i>

313
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.956
So you went with
rare-earth magnetics in the end?

314
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.090
Ah, yes.

315
00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:43.260
Inside a cyanide crystal matrix.

316
00:15:44.727 --> 00:15:46.146
It's kyanite, but...

317
00:15:46.147 --> 00:15:47.564
Kyanite.

318
00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:48.732
Um, may I?

319
00:15:48.733 --> 00:15:49.766
Please.

320
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.834
You delivered on
the safety protocols?

321
00:15:51.968 --> 00:15:56.106
Oh, absolutely. Calisto only
talks with electrical circuitry.

322
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.176
The current never touches
people, pets, plants.

323
00:15:59.309 --> 00:16:01.278
It's smart, and it's safe.

324
00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:03.781
Although, uh, in the spirit
of full disclosure,

325
00:16:03.914 --> 00:16:06.816
I should mention
one small thing.

326
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.587
It can be manufactured
in pastel colors for the ladies.

327
00:16:14.457 --> 00:16:15.659
You...

328
00:16:15.792 --> 00:16:19.830
Ah, well, this is it.

329
00:16:21.432 --> 00:16:24.134
We can bring clean energy
to everyone.

330
00:16:24.902 --> 00:16:26.170
Sustainably.

331
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.474
Calisto is the future.

332
00:16:30.607 --> 00:16:33.776
And I am holding the future
in my hands, finally.

333
00:16:35.111 --> 00:16:36.680
Good work, guys.

334
00:16:37.781 --> 00:16:39.449
Good work.

335
00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.685
Come on, let's celebrate.

Hey, Bosley.

350
00:17:24.828 --> 00:17:26.079

351
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.330
Ah, yes.

00:17:28.531 --> 00:17:32.202
You're the former MI6 ninja.

354
00:17:32.335 --> 00:17:33.335
Is it June?

355
00:17:33.436 --> 00:17:34.671
Oh, Jane.

356
00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.373
Oh, Jane. Jane.
Not the month.

357
00:17:37.507 --> 00:17:38.507
Sabrina?

358
00:17:38.608 --> 00:17:40.544
Sabina.
It's Italian.

359
00:17:40.677 --> 00:17:42.646
Oh, are you Italian?

360
00:17:42.779 --> 00:17:44.346
No. I... Maybe...

361
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.083
We have a situation in Hamburg,
a new client.

362
00:17:47.217 --> 00:17:50.487
Hamburg. Interestingly,
not where hamburgers were invented.

363
00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.922
That was in Frankfurt,

364
00:17:52.055 --> 00:17:54.124
where frankfurters were
not invented, which...

365
00:17:54.258 --> 00:17:55.676
I don't think that this is...

366
00:17:55.677 --> 00:17:57.093
I'm sorry. I'm vegetarian.

367
00:17:57.227 --> 00:17:59.396
Thank you very much.
But I recall hearing

368
00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:01.364
you two worked
well together in Rio.

369
00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.866
I recall her
pushing me off a roof.

370
00:18:04.001 --> 00:18:05.969
I recall it was time to go.

371
00:18:06.102 --> 00:18:08.705
Heh. That makes sense.

372
00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:10.641
Who's the client?

373
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.044

00:18:15.745 --> 00:18:18.314

385
00:18:48.111 --> 00:18:49.446
- Elena?
- Hi.

386
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.881
Welcome.

387
00:18:51.014 --> 00:18:52.315
Uh, Mr. Bosley?

388
00:18:52.449 --> 00:18:54.051
Just Bosley.

389
00:18:54.052 --> 00:18:55.652
Thank you for seeing me. Um...

389b
00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:57.639
<i>Can I interest you in a coffee?</i>

390
00:18:58.121 --> 00:18:59.639
Would you like anything?

391
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.157
Uh, espresso, <i>bitte</i>.

392
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:02.826
<i>Merci, ça va.</i>

393
00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:06.363
Espresso.

394
00:19:06.497 --> 00:19:07.997
COS perimeter check.

395
00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:09.599
"COS"?

396
00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.968
I have less than no idea
what that means,

397
00:19:12.101 --> 00:19:15.005
but you are good up here.

398
00:19:15.138 --> 00:19:16.639
I would say,

399
00:19:16.773 --> 00:19:18.475
the coast is clear.

400
00:19:18.608 --> 00:19:20.443
<i>Yes, exactly.</i>

401
00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:22.045
I have thought about this a lot.

402
00:19:22.178 --> 00:19:24.014
All we have to do
is get it to Mr. Brok.

403
00:19:24.147 --> 00:19:26.049
<i>And I have tried to contact him.</i>

404
00:19:26.183 --> 00:19:28.984
Well, it takes a lot
to come forward,

405
00:19:29.118 --> 00:19:31.687
and I appreciate your courage.

406
00:19:31.821 --> 00:19:33.991
You sure you wanna
take this risk?

407
00:19:35.391 --> 00:19:36.993
Yeah.

408
00:19:37.126 --> 00:19:39.095
Okay, we can help you.

409
00:19:39.229 --> 00:19:40.663
It's just getting out of hand.

410
00:19:40.664 --> 00:19:42.097
Stop it, you're so cute.

411
00:19:43.733 --> 00:19:44.768
I gotta get a dog.

412
00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:47.871
<i>I can't sleep at night,</i>

413
00:19:48.005 --> 00:19:51.541
<i>knowing and not being allowed
to do or say anything about it.</i>

414
00:19:54.411 --> 00:19:55.712
I can fix it,

415
00:19:55.846 --> 00:19:58.048
but I just need the opportunity.

416
00:19:58.181 --> 00:20:01.317
I believe you. Were you able
to get the evidence?

417
00:20:04.855 --> 00:20:06.490
All my reports, all my data.

417b
00:20:20.063 --> 00:20:21.895
<i>Something I can bring you?</i>

359
418
00:20:34.283 --> 00:20:35.852
Your check, sir.

419
00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.420
Was that the signal?

420
00:20:37.554 --> 00:20:39.423
- Elena...
<i>- What's happening?</i>

421
00:20:39.556 --> 00:20:41.158
You need to go
to the ladies' room.

422
00:20:41.291 --> 00:20:42.559
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

423
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.827
Quickly.

424
00:20:46.195 --> 00:20:48.064
<i>Hey, what's happening? Jane?</i>

425
00:20:48.198 --> 00:20:49.499
Now!

426
00:20:51.367 --> 00:20:53.370
Hello... Oh, shit!

427
00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:54.738
Shit!

428
00:20:59.909 --> 00:21:03.246
Ah! Shit, shit, shit!

429
00:21:56.366 --> 00:21:57.501
That's my gun.

430
00:22:04.107 --> 00:22:05.976
Sabina! Hurry!

431
00:22:06.109 --> 00:22:07.109
- Go!
- Go!

432
00:22:09.512 --> 00:22:12.349
Yeah! Evac the client!
That's what I was gonna say!

433
00:22:12.482 --> 00:22:13.884
Whoa!

434
00:22:17.787 --> 00:22:18.888
What's going on?

435
00:22:19.022 --> 00:22:20.273
Oh, God. You're not a waitress?

436
00:22:20.274 --> 00:22:21.524
No.

437
00:22:21.657 --> 00:22:24.494
I'm Jane.
Nice to meet you.

438
00:22:24.628 --> 00:22:25.746
Did you bring the big gun?

439
00:22:25.747 --> 00:22:26.863
In the back.

440
00:22:26.996 --> 00:22:28.331
Can you move your feet?

441
00:22:28.332 --> 00:22:29.666
Oh, sure. Mm-hm.

442
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.535
Oh, do you know how to use that?

442b
00:22:38.609 --> 00:22:39.850
<i>Motherfucker!</i>


443
00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:42.346
Oh, my God!
Is he shooting at us?!

444
00:22:46.683 --> 00:22:47.918
Hold on, ladies.

445
00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:49.152
Whoa!

446
00:22:53.824 --> 00:22:54.958
Whoa!

447
00:23:00.664 --> 00:23:04.067
Is that a tank? Oh, my God.
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

448
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.702
- I think we lost him!
- Bit much for just this girl, no?

449
00:23:06.836 --> 00:23:07.904
Who is this chick?

450
00:23:08.037 --> 00:23:09.037
Who am I?!

451
00:23:09.139 --> 00:23:10.373
Who are you?!
Who is he?

452
00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:12.208
And why is he shooting at us?

453
00:23:12.341 --> 00:23:13.443
Keep it steady.

454
00:23:13.577 --> 00:23:15.112
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.

455
00:23:18.014 --> 00:23:19.082
Oh, no! He's back!

456
00:23:43.205 --> 00:23:44.241
Oh, my God!

457
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:50.346
Oh, shit!

458
00:23:56.853 --> 00:23:57.954
<i>Shit!</i>

459
00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:12.434
Stay low. Stay low.

460
00:24:17.473 --> 00:24:18.875
Do a J-turn on my mark.

461
00:24:18.876 --> 00:24:20.276
Ready.

462
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.745
Now!

463
00:24:38.561 --> 00:24:40.096
Bosley.

464
00:25:45.661 --> 00:25:47.029
Stay down!

465
00:25:49.598 --> 00:25:50.598
Jane!

466
00:25:52.769 --> 00:25:54.503
Hey, I said, stay down!

467
00:25:54.637 --> 00:25:56.138
Hey! Stop moving!

468
00:26:35.945 --> 00:26:37.814
Sandwich?

469
00:26:37.947 --> 00:26:39.449
It's tuna.

470
00:26:39.582 --> 00:26:42.752
Unless it's cheese,
and it's not good.

471
00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.595
How about you?
You hungry?

472
00:27:16.252 --> 00:27:17.821
Charlie sends love, Angels.

473
00:27:17.954 --> 00:27:21.257
Who is she?
Who is she?

474
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.026
Hey, she's in shock,
and she smells like puke.

475
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.161
Who are you?

476
00:27:25.294 --> 00:27:26.462
I'm Bosley.

477
00:27:26.463 --> 00:27:27.630
Bosley?

478
00:27:27.763 --> 00:27:29.865
Bosley's a rank
in our organization.

479
00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:32.635
It's like a lieutenant.

480
00:27:32.768 --> 00:27:35.471
The real name of the man
you met was Edgar Dessange.

481
00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:38.708
Edgar.

482
00:27:42.912 --> 00:27:45.014
Jane, I'm really sorry.

483
00:27:45.147 --> 00:27:46.616
I know how much he meant to you.

484
00:27:46.617 --> 00:27:48.084
Oh, I don't need a hug.

485
00:27:50.753 --> 00:27:52.755
Well, I do.

486
00:27:52.888 --> 00:27:54.591
He was my friend too.

487
00:27:59.829 --> 00:28:01.264
Hugs work.

488
00:28:06.236 --> 00:28:08.471
Okay, let's get you cleaned up.

489
00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:10.006
Come on.

490
00:28:10.139 --> 00:28:11.541
Is that a stolen car?

491
00:28:12.842 --> 00:28:13.843
Okay.

492
00:28:15.144 --> 00:28:17.846
Bosley, 342.
Open Safe House 6.

493
00:28:24.787 --> 00:28:27.523
Boz, who else knew we were
meeting with Elena in Hamburg?

494
00:28:27.657 --> 00:28:30.160
Well, protocol would be
not to tell anyone.

495
00:28:30.293 --> 00:28:31.927
Why do you ask?

496
00:28:32.061 --> 00:28:33.729
Well, Bosley...

497
00:28:33.862 --> 00:28:36.099
Edgar thought...

498
00:28:38.133 --> 00:28:39.902
Okay, you didn't see this guy.

499
00:28:40.035 --> 00:28:42.238
He was a pro, and he brought
a lot of firepower

500
00:28:42.372 --> 00:28:43.506
for such an easy target.

501
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.241
Yeah, he was so extra, right?

502
00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:47.442
I could take that girl out
with a flyswatter.

503
00:28:47.576 --> 00:28:49.846
He rocks up in this
urban assault vehicle.

504
00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:52.548
So we're thinking what?
He was...

505
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:55.384
Maybe she was being watched...

506
00:28:55.518 --> 00:28:56.852
but what if we are?

507
00:28:56.986 --> 00:28:58.788
And by who?

508
00:28:58.789 --> 00:29:00.589
Hey, you guys.
All cleaned up.

509
00:29:00.723 --> 00:29:02.191
Feeling better?

510
00:29:02.192 --> 00:29:03.659
Yes, thank you.

511
00:29:03.793 --> 00:29:06.095
I'm kind of getting this,
you know.

512
00:29:06.228 --> 00:29:09.097
You guys are
like lady spies and...

513
00:29:09.232 --> 00:29:11.734
I just need you to explain
who this guy is

514
00:29:11.867 --> 00:29:13.302
and why was he shooting at you.

515
00:29:13.303 --> 00:29:14.737
Oh, you.

516
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.189
He was shooting at you.

517
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.507
Jane.

518
00:29:19.074 --> 00:29:20.810
At me?

519
00:29:20.943 --> 00:29:22.478
- Oh, God.
- Hey.

520
00:29:22.612 --> 00:29:23.613
Okay.

521
00:29:23.614 --> 00:29:24.614
Just have some tea.

522
00:29:24.747 --> 00:29:27.383
The shooter's a ghost.
Facial recognition's popped him

523
00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:31.654
in a few places over the years
but no name, no record, nothing.

524
00:29:31.788 --> 00:29:33.455
He's got friends in high places.

525
00:29:33.589 --> 00:29:35.024
I'm gonna kill him.

526
00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:36.458
I'm obliged to remind you,

527
00:29:36.592 --> 00:29:38.561
Charlie frowns on revenge, Jane.

528
00:29:38.694 --> 00:29:40.796
So, Ms. Houghlin,

529
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.901
your file says you are a systems
engineer on the Calisto project.

530
00:29:45.034 --> 00:29:46.936
Uh, you know about Calisto?

531
00:29:47.069 --> 00:29:49.172
We know about a lot of things.

532
00:29:49.305 --> 00:29:51.774
That you graduated top
of your class at MIT,

533
00:29:51.907 --> 00:29:54.110
you take Krav Maga,
you ride your bike to work.

534
00:29:54.244 --> 00:29:55.978
You think yellow
is one of your colors

535
00:29:56.112 --> 00:29:57.272
when, in fact, it's no one's.

536
00:29:57.347 --> 00:29:59.148
That you could be dating more

537
00:29:59.282 --> 00:30:02.385
if you played up the cheekbones
in your online profile pictures.

538
00:30:02.518 --> 00:30:06.088
What we don't know,
is why someone wants you dead.

539
00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:08.324
<i>I know it can be fixed.</i>

540
00:30:08.457 --> 00:30:10.994
<i>Let's take this one step at a time.</i>

541
00:30:11.127 --> 00:30:13.129
<i>There's a flaw in the system.</i>

542
00:30:13.262 --> 00:30:14.597
What's the flaw?

543
00:30:15.898 --> 00:30:17.167
Calisto can be weaponized.

544
00:30:18.901 --> 00:30:20.803
I mean, I can fix it.
But right now,

545
00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:23.105
any decent hacker,
curious or criminal enough,

546
00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:26.642
could turn Calisto into an EMP
on the human body.

547
00:30:26.776 --> 00:30:28.277
An electromagnetic pulse.

548
00:30:28.411 --> 00:30:29.778
A brain seizure, essentially.

549
00:30:29.912 --> 00:30:31.814
- Yes.
- See? I know stuff.

550
00:30:31.947 --> 00:30:33.650
It disrupts the neural networks

551
00:30:33.783 --> 00:30:35.718
and looks like
a stroke or an aneurysm.

552
00:30:35.852 --> 00:30:38.187
So it can be used
without a trace of evidence.

553
00:30:38.321 --> 00:30:40.289
A perfect assassination machine.

554
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.525
Yeah. And it can be triggered remotely

555
00:30:42.658 --> 00:30:45.561
across the network
that I created.

556
00:30:45.695 --> 00:30:47.329
Dope. See, that
is what you can do

557
00:30:47.463 --> 00:30:48.715
if you pay attention in school.

558
00:30:48.716 --> 00:30:49.966
Who knows about this?

559
00:30:50.099 --> 00:30:53.336
I filed a report after
it almost killed my colleague

560
00:30:53.469 --> 00:30:56.705
during a security test,
but I think it was buried.

561
00:30:56.839 --> 00:30:58.707
My report,
not my colleague. No.

562
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:00.543
Julio is fine. He, uh...

563
00:31:00.677 --> 00:31:02.712
He just can't speak
or see color anymore.

564
00:31:02.845 --> 00:31:04.346
It's not in production yet?

565
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.616
No, we're behind schedule,
but there are six prototypes

566
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.053
in the Brok facility vault,
plus the one at my lab

567
00:31:10.186 --> 00:31:12.221
that I was using
to program the fix, which...

568
00:31:12.354 --> 00:31:14.190
Let's get those prototypes
out of there.

569
00:31:14.324 --> 00:31:17.625
Uh, I'm sorry. Can we just
hit pause for a second, please?

570
00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.194
Does your company have a website

571
00:31:19.329 --> 00:31:21.130
with an employee directory
with photos?

572
00:31:21.264 --> 00:31:24.032
Yes, but Brok Industries is
equipped with insane security.

573
00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:25.701
- There's no way...
- There we go.

574
00:31:25.834 --> 00:31:28.003
Do you think she still has
security clearance?

575
00:31:28.137 --> 00:31:29.439
If she doesn't, we'll know

576
00:31:29.572 --> 00:31:31.708
the threat comes from within,
so either way...

577
00:31:31.841 --> 00:31:33.442
We get the information we need.

578
00:31:33.443 --> 00:31:35.043
No, no, no.

579
00:31:35.177 --> 00:31:36.913
No, no.

580
00:31:37.046 --> 00:31:38.114
Ooh!

581
00:31:38.115 --> 00:31:39.181
No.

582
00:31:39.315 --> 00:31:40.383
No, no, no.

583
00:31:40.384 --> 00:31:41.451
I...

584
00:31:41.584 --> 00:31:43.119
Huh. Hm...

585
00:31:43.252 --> 00:31:44.604
Bowl cuts.

586
00:31:44.605 --> 00:31:45.955
Bowl cuts.

587
00:31:46.088 --> 00:31:47.257
Bowl cuts.

588
00:31:49.491 --> 00:31:50.626
Bowl cuts.

589
00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:07.676
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

590
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.445
Just trying
to get to work, Ralph.

591
00:32:09.579 --> 00:32:12.415
Well, I gotta do my job too.

592
00:32:13.682 --> 00:32:14.717
Okay.

593
00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:18.637
New look, huh?

594
00:32:18.638 --> 00:32:19.922
Mm-hm.

595
00:32:20.055 --> 00:32:22.592
I like it a lot.

596
00:32:22.725 --> 00:32:25.261
Aren't you holding
people up, Ralph?

597
00:32:25.395 --> 00:32:27.396
Well...

598
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:29.298
you have yourself a good day.

599
00:32:29.432 --> 00:32:31.634
And don't... Don't forget
to smile, yeah?

600
00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:05.401
What?

601
00:33:07.903 --> 00:33:10.673
How...? How did you
even get in the...?

602
00:33:10.806 --> 00:33:13.576
Oh, God. What did
you do to Pradeep?

603
00:33:13.709 --> 00:33:14.977
Pradeep Prasad.

604
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:17.347
<i>Nothing.
Pradeep's fine.</i>

605
00:33:19.949 --> 00:33:23.252
<i>I nabbed his ID card
from the gym this morning.</i>

606
00:33:23.386 --> 00:33:25.087
Hi.

607
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.023
Bye.

608
00:33:27.156 --> 00:33:28.191
Hi.

609
00:33:28.192 --> 00:33:29.225
Hi.

610
00:33:31.293 --> 00:33:33.061
And Sven?

611
00:33:33.195 --> 00:33:34.564
<i>I compressed his carotid</i>

612
00:33:34.697 --> 00:33:36.532
<i>and deoxygenated his brain stem.</i>

613
00:33:37.633 --> 00:33:38.734
<i>What?</i>

614
00:33:38.868 --> 00:33:40.703
Well, that sounds painful.

615
00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:42.304
Yeah, it's like taking a nap.

616
00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:45.374
You smell burnt toast,
then everything goes dark.

617
00:33:45.508 --> 00:33:47.375
Hey, don't worry,
he's gonna wake up.

618
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.077
Heh, unless he doesn't.

619
00:33:49.212 --> 00:33:50.880
- What...?
- We should go.

620
00:33:51.013 --> 00:33:53.349
If we're in the building
when they do their sweep,

621
00:33:53.482 --> 00:33:54.850
we're going to German prison.

622
00:33:54.984 --> 00:33:56.919
Hm, and then it's schnitzel.
All the time.

623
00:33:57.052 --> 00:33:58.488
Not such a bad deal, actually.

624
00:33:58.621 --> 00:34:00.622
Sabina, you get Calisto
from the vault.

625
00:34:00.756 --> 00:34:02.792
Elena, you get the prototype
from your lab.

626
00:34:02.925 --> 00:34:04.493
I'll keep security distracted.

627
00:34:04.626 --> 00:34:07.029
Okay. You ready?

628
00:34:07.162 --> 00:34:09.131
Yeah. High five.
Girl power.

629
00:34:14.203 --> 00:34:15.871
Oh.

630
00:34:16.004 --> 00:34:17.640
Thank you.

- What?

682
00:37:20.523 --> 00:37:21.856
- Now I got her.
- Where?

684
00:37:24.292 --> 00:37:25.761
Eleven?

685
00:37:25.894 --> 00:37:28.363
Guys, she's on 11.
Level 11, women's restroom.

686
00:37:38.073 --> 00:37:39.741
Hi. Uh, who are you?

687
00:37:39.875 --> 00:37:42.044
Shh. Sit down.
Hands where I can see them.

688
00:37:47.783 --> 00:37:50.286
Are you with Health and Safety?

689
00:37:50.419 --> 00:37:52.888
God, these things
are impossible to open.

690
00:37:55.791 --> 00:38:00.062
Um, you're really not supposed
to be touching things in here

691
00:38:00.195 --> 00:38:02.932
unless you're supposed to be
touching things in here.

692
00:38:11.673 --> 00:38:14.209
You put your mouth on it.

693
00:38:14.343 --> 00:38:17.713
Twenty billion bacteria
reside in the human mouth.

694
00:38:19.248 --> 00:38:20.549
You're adorable.

695
00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:23.001
<i>Jane?</i>

695b
00:38:23.095 --> 00:38:24.381
Jane, is that you flirting?

696
00:38:36.198 --> 00:38:37.266
Hey!

697
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.269
Stop! Hey!

698
00:38:41.637 --> 00:38:42.772
Hey!

699
00:39:15.237 --> 00:39:16.237
Oh, come on.

700
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.328
You ready?

701
00:39:44.533 --> 00:39:46.268
Hey! Hey!

702
00:39:47.703 --> 00:39:49.438
- Sorry!
- Hey!

703
00:39:50.538 --> 00:39:52.441
Oh, my God!

704
00:39:52.575 --> 00:39:53.876
Get back here!

705
00:39:56.879 --> 00:39:57.879
Who has eyes on her?

706
00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.014
She set a fire on four.

707
00:39:59.147 --> 00:40:00.515
We are following her to three.

708
00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:02.351
Let's go, guys! Come on.

709
00:40:02.352 --> 00:40:04.053
Three? She was on 11.

710
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.756
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

711
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:11.259
What did you...?

712
00:40:11.393 --> 00:40:12.728
Hold this.

713
00:40:12.729 --> 00:40:14.062
Okay.

714
00:40:14.196 --> 00:40:16.431
Oh, that's... That's not you.

715
00:40:16.565 --> 00:40:17.933
No.

716
00:40:19.668 --> 00:40:20.836
Hold this.

717
00:40:20.837 --> 00:40:22.003
Okay.

718
00:40:22.137 --> 00:40:24.206
Can you unzip me?

719
00:40:24.339 --> 00:40:25.841
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

720
00:40:27.209 --> 00:40:28.209
Sorry.

721
00:40:33.882 --> 00:40:35.784
Bye.

722
00:40:35.917 --> 00:40:37.853
- You don't want your...?
- Keep it!

723
00:41:02.277 --> 00:41:02.945
<i>Hello?</i>

723b
00:41:02.995 --> 00:41:03.745
Hey, Susan.

724
00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:06.180
Mr. Fleming would like you
in the lab right away.

725
00:41:06.315 --> 00:41:06.950
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

725b
00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:07.850
Okay. Thanks.

726
00:41:07.983 --> 00:41:09.952
- Did you see her?
- Yes.

727
00:41:10.085 --> 00:41:11.786
Not on-screen.
With your eyes!

728
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.856
- You go there, you go there. Now!
- Okay!

729
00:41:16.592 --> 00:41:17.759
<i>I'm out.</i>

730
00:41:17.893 --> 00:41:18.893
I'm out.

731
00:41:21.596 --> 00:41:22.865
Main lobby. I see her!

732
00:41:22.866 --> 00:41:24.133
Where?!

733
00:41:25.434 --> 00:41:27.468
Lobby level.
Lobby level!

734
00:41:27.603 --> 00:41:29.838
Let's go, guys. Come on!

735
00:41:29.971 --> 00:41:31.940
Put your hands where I can see them.

736
00:41:33.242 --> 00:41:34.610
Get on the ground! Now!

737
00:41:34.743 --> 00:41:35.977
Let me see your hands!

738
00:41:36.111 --> 00:41:37.512
- Do it!
- What for?

739
00:41:37.646 --> 00:41:39.314
I don't know.
I don't know! Ah!

740
00:41:39.447 --> 00:41:42.249
I don't know what for.
What are you looking for? Ah!

741
00:41:42.384 --> 00:41:43.686
Sorry, Susan.

742
00:41:48.524 --> 00:41:51.226
"Susan Olsen."

743
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.064
Put all the exits on lockdown.
Sweep from the bottom up.

744
00:41:55.197 --> 00:41:56.832
Jane. I got it.

745
00:41:56.965 --> 00:41:59.501
The unit's gone. We need to go.
Someone beat us to it.

746
00:41:59.634 --> 00:42:01.369
Are you kidding?
They were stolen?

747
00:42:01.503 --> 00:42:03.205
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Oh!

748
00:42:03.338 --> 00:42:04.606
Oh!

749
00:42:04.607 --> 00:42:05.874
God!

750
00:42:06.007 --> 00:42:07.976
Any ideas?
Is there another way out?

751
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.245
Wait, wait. I can hack this.

752
00:42:10.378 --> 00:42:13.481
Turn it into an EMP, overload
the electronics in the door.

753
00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:15.250
Won't that kill us
in the process?

754
00:42:15.384 --> 00:42:18.487
It's short proximity. We should
be okay if we keep our distance.

755
00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.655
How far?

756
00:42:19.656 --> 00:42:20.689
Uh...

757
00:42:20.822 --> 00:42:22.122
Here is far enough, I guess.

758
00:42:22.257 --> 00:42:24.026
You guess?
Do scientists usually guess?

759
00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:26.994
Of course. It's the first step
in the scientific method.

760
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:29.296
Hypothesis.

761
00:42:29.431 --> 00:42:31.533
Calisto, short-range
power burst.

762
00:42:31.666 --> 00:42:33.735
Okay, it's powering up.
It's powering up.

763
00:42:38.339 --> 00:42:39.675
This should work.

764
00:42:44.479 --> 00:42:46.148
- Ralph.
- No.

765
00:42:46.281 --> 00:42:47.281
God.

766
00:42:50.252 --> 00:42:51.520
- I have time.
- No.

767
00:42:51.653 --> 00:42:53.188
I have to. I have to.

768
00:42:53.189 --> 00:42:54.723
No. No. Stay here!

769
00:42:54.857 --> 00:42:57.359
Ralph? Ralph.
Get over here now.

770
00:42:57.492 --> 00:42:59.428
- There you are.
- Ralph, it's about to blow.

771
00:42:59.561 --> 00:43:01.697
I can't stop it.
Get over here.

772
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.531
You think
I'm gonna listen to you?

773
00:43:03.665 --> 00:43:05.350
Ralph, come! Get over here now!

774
00:43:05.351 --> 00:43:07.035
Put hands where I can see them!

775
00:43:20.415 --> 00:43:22.518
- Let's get out of here.
- Do we need that?

776
00:43:22.651 --> 00:43:24.495
- No, it's useless now.
- Then leave it.

777
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:27.055
- Move it or lose it, ladies.
- Let's go. We gotta go.

778
00:43:27.189 --> 00:43:29.592
Come on, come on. Get in.

779
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:44.707
Do you think
Ralph's gonna be okay?

780
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:48.443
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he's fine.

781
00:43:48.577 --> 00:43:49.612
He seemed fine, right?

782
00:43:49.613 --> 00:43:50.646
Yeah.

783
00:43:50.779 --> 00:43:53.849
I'm sure... I'm sure he's okay.
I'm sure he's fine.

784
00:43:58.787 --> 00:44:01.990
Oh, well, that's a shame.

785
00:44:02.124 --> 00:44:04.459
Obviously, this is
a disappointing setback,

786
00:44:04.592 --> 00:44:07.262
but we have time.

787
00:44:07.395 --> 00:44:10.131
Do you know what?
Just get John on the phone.

788
00:44:10.265 --> 00:44:11.266
Now.

789
00:44:13.669 --> 00:44:15.838
Well, then wake him up.

790
00:44:20.775 --> 00:44:21.777
Everything all right?

791
00:44:24.479 --> 00:44:25.513

Welcome to the Berlin outpost
of the Townsend Agency.

816
00:45:26.942 --> 00:45:28.810
- Is there food?
- I'm starving.

817
00:45:28.943 --> 00:45:31.513
All women are starving
all the time.

818
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:36.201
<i>Mi chico.</i>

819
00:45:36.202 --> 00:45:38.053
Here they are.
Welcome back.

820
00:45:38.187 --> 00:45:39.588
<i>Mi amor, como estas?</i>
(My love, how are you?)

821
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:40.856
- Very <i>bien</i>.
- Good.

822
00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:42.757
- Cool.
- Well...

823
00:45:42.891 --> 00:45:44.492
Hey.

824
00:45:45.694 --> 00:45:47.563
You owe me a burpee now, okay?

825
00:45:49.197 --> 00:45:51.890
Hey. Bombay sister.
How are you?

826
00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:52.601
Master.

827
00:45:52.734 --> 00:45:54.202
Good to see you.

828
00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:56.037
- This is Elena.
- Pleasure to meet you.

829
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.355
Saint.

830
00:45:57.356 --> 00:45:58.540
Wow.

831
00:45:58.674 --> 00:46:01.910
Wow. You have
this beautiful energy.

832
00:46:02.044 --> 00:46:03.878
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

833
00:46:04.012 --> 00:46:05.197
Oh, Jesus.

834
00:46:05.198 --> 00:46:06.381
Oh, wait, what?

835
00:46:06.515 --> 00:46:07.900
Oh, my God. Yeah, um...

836
00:46:07.901 --> 00:46:09.284
Oh, no.

837
00:46:09.418 --> 00:46:12.553
I would love to apply
a firm touch to your back.

838
00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:13.805
Do you consent?

839
00:46:13.806 --> 00:46:14.923
Yeah, sure.

840
00:46:15.056 --> 00:46:17.126
Okay. Just let me
try to find this.

841
00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.594
Oh! Oh.

842
00:46:19.595 --> 00:46:20.728
Oh, yeah.

843
00:46:20.862 --> 00:46:21.862
- Oh.
- Good?

844
00:46:21.964 --> 00:46:23.565
Oh, yeah, yeah. Amazing.

845
00:46:23.699 --> 00:46:25.333
Displaced rib.
Very common.

846
00:46:25.466 --> 00:46:28.403
If you ever need additional
adjustments, I'm here for you.

847
00:46:28.536 --> 00:46:30.872
The Saint takes care
of our health and well-being.

848
00:46:31.005 --> 00:46:32.273
Keeps us in fighting shape

849
00:46:32.274 --> 00:46:33.541
Yeah. Well, I try.

850
00:46:33.675 --> 00:46:36.077
He feeds our mind,
body and soul.

851
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:39.113
Oh, should we take a moment
to remember Edgar?

852
00:46:40.248 --> 00:46:41.783
I prepared a mini feast

853
00:46:41.917 --> 00:46:44.986
to honor our beautiful friend.

854
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.924
I got Pecorino Nero,
Parmigiano-Reggiano, Manchego,

855
00:46:49.057 --> 00:46:50.325
and, of course...

856
00:46:50.326 --> 00:46:51.592
Thanks.

857
00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:53.093
- He loved Brie.
- Yeah.

858
00:46:53.228 --> 00:46:54.897
Ah! And wine.

859
00:46:54.898 --> 00:46:56.565
Especially wine.

860
00:46:56.698 --> 00:46:58.634
Wow, I thought
you guys were gonna serve,

861
00:46:58.767 --> 00:47:00.435
like, bean sprouts
and wheatgrass.

862
00:47:00.569 --> 00:47:02.704
Eating is all about the intention

863
00:47:02.838 --> 00:47:03.939
you put into your meal.

864
00:47:04.072 --> 00:47:05.340
If you honor the cow,

865
00:47:05.473 --> 00:47:07.842
the cheese is
gonna be good for you.

866
00:47:07.976 --> 00:47:09.945
By the way, I understand
the circumstances

867
00:47:10.078 --> 00:47:12.014
that brought you here
have been stressful.

868
00:47:12.147 --> 00:47:13.465
So stressful.

869
00:47:13.466 --> 00:47:14.783
If you ever need to talk,

870
00:47:14.916 --> 00:47:16.318
I'm a licensed psychotherapist.

871
00:47:16.451 --> 00:47:19.220
Wow. I can really see
why you guys call him...

872
00:47:19.354 --> 00:47:20.756
The Saint.

873
00:47:20.757 --> 00:47:22.157
Yes. Okay.

874
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:23.742
Oh, electrolyte-enhanced water?

875
00:47:23.743 --> 00:47:25.193
Mm, fine.

876
00:47:25.326 --> 00:47:28.330
Oh, and also try this. It's
really good for your breath.

877
00:47:29.698 --> 00:47:30.816
Oh, thank you.

878
00:47:30.817 --> 00:47:31.933
Good.

879
00:47:35.236 --> 00:47:37.773
I sent the ID of the last person
to access the vault

880
00:47:37.906 --> 00:47:40.175
through our search system,
ran every CCTV

881
00:47:40.308 --> 00:47:43.178
and security cam in Hamburg.

882
00:47:43.311 --> 00:47:46.280
Fleming. That's my... That's
the guy that buried my report.

883
00:47:46.414 --> 00:47:47.549
Hm.

884
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:48.684
Look. There.

885
00:47:48.817 --> 00:47:51.119
He was at the airport
five hours ago.

886
00:47:51.253 --> 00:47:53.188
- So he's left Germany.
- With the case.

887
00:47:53.322 --> 00:47:55.157
He knows exactly
what Calisto can do.

888
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.359
He knows what it's worth
on the black market.

889
00:47:57.492 --> 00:47:59.794
If he's selling it,
he'd want you out of the way.

890
00:47:59.928 --> 00:48:01.596
- I'm broadening the search.
- I'm sorry.

891
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:03.198
Fleming tried to have me killed?

892
00:48:03.332 --> 00:48:06.200
Maybe. Maybe at
the direction of a buyer.

893
00:48:06.334 --> 00:48:09.104
Bad guys don't like loose ends,
you made a fancy new toy...

894
00:48:09.238 --> 00:48:11.506
But I worked for him.
I mean...

895
00:48:13.408 --> 00:48:14.576
he flirted with me.

896
00:48:14.709 --> 00:48:16.178
Oh, honey.

897
00:48:16.311 --> 00:48:18.245
A man can love you
and want you dead.

898
00:48:18.379 --> 00:48:20.182
Ha, not me.

899
00:48:20.315 --> 00:48:22.016
There was a gunfight
at my wedding.

900
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:23.702
Wait, you're married?

901
00:48:23.703 --> 00:48:25.254
No. I was the better shot.

902
00:48:26.655 --> 00:48:27.956
All right. I need cheese.

903
00:48:28.089 --> 00:48:29.958
"Cheese." Is that
a code for something?

904
00:48:30.092 --> 00:48:32.760
Yes. It's code for
"I'm 40 and single,

905
00:48:32.894 --> 00:48:35.830
and I have a cheese-size hole
in my soul to fill."

906
00:48:35.964 --> 00:48:38.032
I also have vegan ice cream
for your soul.

907
00:48:38.166 --> 00:48:39.667
You really know what I need.

908
00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:41.536
I should have
just gone around Fleming

909
00:48:41.669 --> 00:48:44.039
and not followed
some stupid chain of command.

910
00:48:44.172 --> 00:48:48.076
Gone directly to Brok.
But, no, I just rolled over.

911
00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:49.677
You're probably the last people

912
00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:51.513
that would know
what that feels like.

913
00:48:51.646 --> 00:48:54.048
I grew up with
major abandonment issues.

914
00:48:54.182 --> 00:48:56.384
It led to some pretty
self-sabotaging behavior,

915
00:48:56.517 --> 00:48:59.721
which landed me in various
institutional facilities.

916
00:48:59.854 --> 00:49:01.423
Charlie bailed me out.

917
00:49:01.556 --> 00:49:03.358
And if it wasn't for Charlie...

918
00:49:05.193 --> 00:49:08.461
I'd probably be dead or back
in prison, so I feel you.

919
00:49:08.596 --> 00:49:12.233
I pretty much grew up on the
corner of powerless and ashamed.

920
00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:15.137
Wait. You grew up on Park
Avenue. Aren't you an heiress?

921
00:49:16.771 --> 00:49:18.673
More money, more problems.

922
00:49:18.807 --> 00:49:21.442
- So, what about you?
- How did Charlie find you?

923
00:49:21.576 --> 00:49:24.613
Jane is former MI6.
Youngest recruit ever.

924
00:49:24.746 --> 00:49:26.414
You worked
for British intelligence?

925
00:49:26.547 --> 00:49:28.482
She said "former."

926
00:49:28.616 --> 00:49:30.351
I also followed the rules.

927
00:49:30.485 --> 00:49:33.988
The chain of command didn't
work out so well for me either.

928
00:49:36.258 --> 00:49:37.993
Ralph's dead.

929
00:49:38.126 --> 00:49:39.928
I killed Ralph.

930
00:49:40.061 --> 00:49:41.229
I'm... I'm a murderer.

931
00:49:41.363 --> 00:49:42.564
- No.
- No, no, no.

932
00:49:42.697 --> 00:49:44.097
Collateral damage.

933
00:49:44.232 --> 00:49:45.800
I wouldn't take that on.

934
00:49:45.933 --> 00:49:49.437
The point is, if Calisto
falls in the wrong hands...

935
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:53.106
I mean, we have to get it back
before it hurts more people.

936
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.278
Well, now's our chance.

937
00:49:57.412 --> 00:50:00.281
Mr. Fleming just cleared
passport control in Istanbul.

938
00:50:01.449 --> 00:50:02.617
Oh, no.

939
00:50:02.618 --> 00:50:03.784
No.

940
00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:05.753
What's your problem
with Istanbul?

941
00:50:05.887 --> 00:50:07.822
I got food poisoning
from undercooked lamb

942
00:50:07.956 --> 00:50:10.358
and yogurt sauce I left out,
but then I got hungry.

943
00:50:10.492 --> 00:50:11.943
What about you?

944
00:50:11.944 --> 00:50:13.394
Not that.

945
00:50:13.528 --> 00:50:14.696
Will you excuse us?

946
00:50:17.132 --> 00:50:18.567
We'll be right back.

947
00:50:21.135 --> 00:50:25.039
I wanna be sure that assassin
stays away from us.

948
00:50:25.173 --> 00:50:28.209
We should keep this quiet until
we know who all the players are.

949
00:50:28.343 --> 00:50:30.712
We don't know what this
Calisto is or who wants it,

950
00:50:30.845 --> 00:50:33.180
so let's play it safe.

951
00:50:33.315 --> 00:50:36.151
What about
Ralph-killer in there?

952
00:50:36.284 --> 00:50:38.552
Take her to the closet,
gear her up.

953
00:50:38.686 --> 00:50:42.524
And if anybody asks,
we're going to Brazil.

954
00:50:42.657 --> 00:50:44.559
Okay.

955
00:51:00.675 --> 00:51:01.676
Istanbul.

956
00:51:06.281 --> 00:51:07.649
What about Elena Houghlin?

957
00:51:07.782 --> 00:51:09.851
I think you know what to do.

958
00:51:27.369 --> 00:51:28.637
<i>I took it apart.</i>

959
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:32.074
Nothing. No tracker.

960
00:51:33.274 --> 00:51:35.376
It's not emitting any signals.

961
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:36.577
What had you worried?

962
00:51:38.212 --> 00:51:39.881
To be honest, I don't know.

963
00:51:40.014 --> 00:51:41.381
A feeling.

964
00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:43.351
- Something in the bones.
- Hmph.

965
00:51:43.484 --> 00:51:45.253
Old habits.

966
00:51:45.387 --> 00:51:47.889
Perhaps it's simply
that you miss the job.

967
00:51:48.022 --> 00:51:49.958
We all get old, my friend.

968
00:51:50.091 --> 00:51:52.426
Retirement is not
a death sentence.

969
00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.296
Says the man
who refuses to retire.

970
00:51:57.932 --> 00:51:59.399
Mm, come on.

971
00:52:07.508 --> 00:52:09.744
What?

972
00:52:15.249 --> 00:52:17.285
Something in the bones, indeed.

973
00:52:17.418 --> 00:52:19.019
Who would do this to you?

974
00:52:26.428 --> 00:52:29.331
Someone who knows I'm on to her.

975
00:52:31.799 --> 00:52:33.001
Thank you.

976
00:52:48.383 --> 00:52:50.619
Look at this.

977
00:52:51.953 --> 00:52:55.089
This is the closet of my dreams.

978
00:52:55.223 --> 00:52:57.626
And I just get
to take whatever I want?

979
00:52:57.759 --> 00:52:58.943
Borrow.

980
00:52:58.944 --> 00:53:00.127
Oh.

981
00:53:00.261 --> 00:53:01.996
Is that an actual rule?

982
00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:06.800
Okay. So you wanna start
with a protective base layer.

983
00:53:06.935 --> 00:53:10.504
I recommend
a beaded camisole. Yeah?

984
00:53:10.638 --> 00:53:13.207
Oh. Some kind
of polymer material.

985
00:53:13.341 --> 00:53:15.910
Uh, bulletproof,
composite body armor.

986
00:53:16.044 --> 00:53:19.214
It was originally developed as a
protective layer for spacecraft.

987
00:53:19.347 --> 00:53:22.751
Yeah. And it's a bra
that doesn't dig. Progress.

988
00:53:22.884 --> 00:53:25.386
How we doing down here?

989
00:53:25.519 --> 00:53:27.354
Ah, we're still
in the first closet.

990
00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:31.258
There's another closet?

991
00:53:31.392 --> 00:53:33.327
Hm. Armory open.

992
00:53:37.198 --> 00:53:38.700
Jane, I wanna show
you something.

993
00:53:43.371 --> 00:53:44.806
Whoa.

994
00:53:44.807 --> 00:53:46.241
Come on, check it out.

995
00:53:47.642 --> 00:53:49.344
- Here, try these on.
- Oh, thank you.

996
00:53:49.477 --> 00:53:51.579
Why? What do they do? Whoa!

997
00:53:51.712 --> 00:53:53.982
What do they do? Whoa.

998
00:53:56.484 --> 00:53:58.753
Huh. You're younger
than I thought.

999
00:53:58.886 --> 00:54:00.088
I've lived hard.

1000
00:54:00.221 --> 00:54:02.089
Think you can put
that MIT degree to use

1001
00:54:02.223 --> 00:54:03.992
- with something like this?
- What is it?

1002
00:54:04.125 --> 00:54:06.728
Universal Interface. Lets you
hack into almost anything.

1003
00:54:06.861 --> 00:54:09.831
Mm-mm, not almost anything.
Everything.

1004
00:54:09.964 --> 00:54:12.266
- So here's the new baby.
- What's that?

1005
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.238
High-velocity rifle, customized
to fire tranquilizer darts.

1006
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:19.640
The load: nonlethal,
fast-acting, very potent.

1007
00:54:19.773 --> 00:54:21.376
Jane, you have
a new cuddle buddy.

1008
00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:23.878
Oh, Jesus.

1009
00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:25.813
Shall we fit Elena with comms?

1010
00:54:25.946 --> 00:54:27.215
I think so.

1011
00:54:27.348 --> 00:54:29.284
Oh, that in-ear radio thing
you guys have?

1012
00:54:29.417 --> 00:54:30.784
Ah, even better.

1013
00:54:30.918 --> 00:54:32.553
It's a subdermal transmitter.

1014
00:54:32.687 --> 00:54:34.889
Works through
bone conduction. See?

1015
00:54:35.023 --> 00:54:36.624
So I'm getting a tattoo?

1016
00:54:38.292 --> 00:54:40.962
Uh, no. Tattoos are earned
by Angels over time.

1017
00:54:41.096 --> 00:54:42.730
You'll get
a less permanent version.

1018
00:54:42.863 --> 00:54:45.933
Yeah, comms are concealed
in the link.

1019
00:54:46.066 --> 00:54:48.102
As long as you have it on,
you can hear us.

1020
00:54:48.236 --> 00:54:51.106
Cool. Hey, can I take
these mints?

1021
00:54:51.239 --> 00:54:53.408
No. Avoid the mints.

1022
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:55.977
Actually, let's just stop
the touching around here.

1023
00:54:56.111 --> 00:54:58.413
- You know, some of this blows up.
- Oh.

1024
00:55:13.461 --> 00:55:15.162
This place is amazing.

1025
00:55:15.296 --> 00:55:18.032
It's the crossroads of the world.
Danger and money.

1026
00:55:18.166 --> 00:55:21.168
We need to figure out exactly  where your 
Mr. Fleming's meeting his mystery buyer

1027
00:55:21.302 --> 00:55:23.037
and get Calisto back
before it becomes

1028
00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:25.439
every bad guy's
favorite new weapon.

1029
00:55:25.573 --> 00:55:27.025
Like suitcase nukes.

1030
00:55:27.026 --> 00:55:28.476
Pet tigers.

1031
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:29.644
Jet Skis.

1032
00:55:29.645 --> 00:55:30.678
Sea-Doos.

1033
00:55:30.811 --> 00:55:33.514
Cars that go fast
really furiously.

1034
00:55:33.647 --> 00:55:34.949
So how do we find him?

1035
00:55:35.082 --> 00:55:38.152
Well, we're off
the agency's grid here, so...

1036
00:55:38.285 --> 00:55:42.624
How do we find him? We hit
the streets. We go old-school.

1037
00:55:42.757 --> 00:55:45.393
We sling some bills.
We get violent.

1038
00:55:45.527 --> 00:55:47.528
I feel like a tiger today,
maybe a leopard.

1039
00:55:47.662 --> 00:55:49.930
But either way,
I am down to get wild.

1040
00:55:50.064 --> 00:55:51.332
I might have a contact here.

1041
00:55:51.466 --> 00:55:53.134
An asset
from when I was with MI6.

1042
00:55:53.267 --> 00:55:54.502
Uh, "might" as in?

1043
00:55:54.635 --> 00:55:56.137
As in she definitely lives here,

1044
00:55:56.271 --> 00:55:57.972
and she definitely hates me.

1045
00:56:08.582 --> 00:56:10.150
Practice your English?

1046
00:56:10.284 --> 00:56:12.153
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Well done.

1047
00:56:12.286 --> 00:56:13.421
Candy!

1048
00:56:13.422 --> 00:56:14.556
Candy.

1049
00:56:16.757 --> 00:56:18.626
Still spoiling the local kids?

1050
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.529
You. Get away from me.

1051
00:56:22.663 --> 00:56:25.900
Fatima, wait.
Please, just talk to me.

1052
00:56:26.034 --> 00:56:28.769
Talk to someone else. I can't
get involved with you again.

1053
00:56:28.903 --> 00:56:30.204
Fatima, please wait.

1054
00:56:30.337 --> 00:56:32.407
I waited for you already.

1055
00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.375
Remember?

1056
00:56:34.508 --> 00:56:38.111
And I wasn't there for you,
but I don't work for MI6 anymore.

1057
00:56:38.246 --> 00:56:39.547
I work for these people now.

1058
00:56:39.548 --> 00:56:40.848
I don't care.

1059
00:56:40.982 --> 00:56:42.416
I don't help you.

1060
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:44.752
You know why.

1061
00:56:44.886 --> 00:56:48.089
They are very well-funded.
Non-governmental, NGO.

1062
00:56:48.222 --> 00:56:51.258
They can get whatever you need
to get up and running today.

1063
00:56:51.393 --> 00:56:54.062
No waiting.
No broken promises.

1064
00:57:01.302 --> 00:57:02.570
Thank you.

1065
00:57:02.704 --> 00:57:04.606
It's only tea.

1066
00:57:06.374 --> 00:57:08.209
What do you want from me?

1067
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:18.052
Have you seen this man?

1068
00:57:21.322 --> 00:57:22.624
Maybe...

1069
00:57:23.691 --> 00:57:25.459
you know someone who has.

1070
00:57:27.628 --> 00:57:29.963
Please. I can help you.

1071
00:57:30.097 --> 00:57:31.832
Rebuild the clinic.

1072
00:57:31.966 --> 00:57:33.551
You can help me now?

1073
00:57:33.552 --> 00:57:35.136
I'm sorry.

1074
00:57:35.269 --> 00:57:38.139
I believed them when they
told me my asset was safe.

1075
00:57:38.272 --> 00:57:40.841
And I believed you,
but I lost everything.

1076
00:57:40.974 --> 00:57:45.012
I had to turn away unwed mothers
I could no longer help.

1077
00:57:45.146 --> 00:57:46.448
I know.

1078
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:50.752
It's why I quit.

1079
00:57:53.487 --> 00:57:55.890
But let me rebuild our trust.

1080
00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:00.495
I brought you the usual.

1081
00:58:03.531 --> 00:58:05.099
It's right outside.

1082
00:58:10.905 --> 00:58:12.006
Show me.

1083
00:58:15.243 --> 00:58:17.745
I can get you another shipment
in six months.

1084
00:58:17.878 --> 00:58:18.979
Four.

1085
00:58:22.783 --> 00:58:25.820
So how long will it take for
your sources to find our guy?

1086
00:58:25.953 --> 00:58:27.555
Because we really need to...

1087
00:58:31.092 --> 00:58:33.127
Is this what the doctor ordered?

1088
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:36.164
Okay. Let's get this
off the street.

1089
00:58:36.297 --> 00:58:37.298
All right.

1090
00:58:40.601 --> 00:58:41.635
Good job, Jane.

1091
00:58:47.208 --> 00:58:51.045
Your man is in a hotel.
The Pasha Hotel.

1092
00:58:51.179 --> 00:58:53.348
The Ibrahim Pasha?

1093
00:58:53.481 --> 00:58:55.984
Do you know anybody
who can get us into his room?

1094
00:58:56.117 --> 00:58:57.316
Of course.

1095
00:58:57.451 --> 00:58:59.487
I will take the van too.

1096
00:59:07.028 --> 00:59:08.530
Of course.

1097
00:59:12.332 --> 00:59:14.001

When Fleming goes out, we go in.

1104
00:59:36.724 --> 00:59:39.626
Double his devices.
Gather all his communications.

1105

The when, the where, the who.

1106
00:59:43.164 --> 00:59:46.367
He's been looking at property
in Costa Rica.

1107
00:59:46.501 --> 00:59:49.703

an offshore bank account.

No, I can't find my hat.

Let me help you with that.

1130
01:01:04.712 --> 01:01:06.513
- Your hat.
- Thank you. Yes. Thank you.

1131
01:01:06.647 --> 01:01:08.449
Have you seen my phone?

1132
01:01:10.651 --> 01:01:12.153
- Your bag.
- Oh, thanks.

1133
01:01:13.554 --> 01:01:15.323
- Oh, there it is.
- Thank you.

1134
01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:22.129
<i>Alrighty, here it is.
We filtered his communications,</i>

1135
01:01:22.263 --> 01:01:24.532
and it seems Mr. Fleming
is selling Calisto

1136
01:01:24.665 --> 01:01:26.601
tomorrow at the Turkish derby.

1137
01:01:26.734 --> 01:01:29.036
Veliefendi Hippodrome.

1138
01:01:29.170 --> 01:01:30.804
<i>Of course,
this particular racetrack</i>

1139
01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:33.307
<i>is popular with a syndicate
of wealthy businessmen.</i>

1140
01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:34.909
<i>No doubt with connections</i>

1141
01:01:35.042 --> 01:01:36.911
<i>to international arms deals,
drug trade and...</i>

1142
01:01:37.044 --> 01:01:39.413
<i>All parties who might
be interested in Calisto.</i>

1143
01:01:39.546 --> 01:01:41.226
<i>Familiarize yourselves:
syndicate members,</i>

1144
01:01:41.348 --> 01:01:42.948
<i>wealthy horse owners
expected to attend.</i>

1145
01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:45.185
<i>Flag anyone Fleming
could be in business with.</i>

1146
01:01:45.319 --> 01:01:46.521
I wanna help.

1147
01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:50.691
Look, I am not
just some frightened girl

1148
01:01:50.825 --> 01:01:52.927
in your witness
protection program.

1149
01:01:53.061 --> 01:01:56.162
If you need help getting in and
out of someplace, I can do it.

1150
01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:59.700
I can hack any system,
and I can do it fast.

1151
01:01:59.834 --> 01:02:01.602
You need me, Mrs. Bosley.

1152
01:02:01.736 --> 01:02:04.638
And don't tell me I can't do it
because I know I can.

1153
01:02:04.772 --> 01:02:06.974
I am... I'm done
sitting still. I'm...

1154
01:02:07.107 --> 01:02:09.811
I've had a taste.
I want more.

1155
01:02:11.445 --> 01:02:12.546
I want in.

1156
01:02:14.382 --> 01:02:17.484
You know, I once saw
a really fat baby

1157
01:02:17.618 --> 01:02:20.421
giving Eskimo kisses
to a kitten.

1158
01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:24.392
And that was more adorable.

1159
01:02:24.525 --> 01:02:26.427
Also, it's implied
that you're coming

1160
01:02:26.561 --> 01:02:28.195
because you're in this briefing.

1161
01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:30.564
Yeah, she gave you
the universal hacking tool

1162
01:02:30.697 --> 01:02:32.999
and the bracelet, right?

1163
01:02:33.134 --> 01:02:34.902
Mm-hm. Yeah.

1164
01:02:35.035 --> 01:02:39.206
But how'd that feel? It looked
like it felt really good.

1165
01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.476
- Felt nice.
- I was just gonna give you

1166
01:02:41.609 --> 01:02:43.111
The tablet once I was done.

1167
01:02:43.112 --> 01:02:44.612
Mm.

1168
01:02:47.948 --> 01:02:49.033
Uh, carry on.

1169
01:02:49.034 --> 01:02:50.117
Great.

1170
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.086
As I was about to say,

1171
01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:53.721
<i>there's a lot of ground
to cover,</i>

1172
01:02:53.855 --> 01:02:55.756
<i>so we're gonna need
to spread out.</i>

1173
01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:58.493
<i>Elena, you'll be
our eye in the sky.</i>

1174
01:02:58.626 --> 01:03:02.329
<i>The track's mainframe's located
just inside the press box.</i>

1175
01:03:02.463 --> 01:03:05.566
<i>We'll get you in. You hack
into the security cameras.</i>

1176
01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.135
<i>Watch for Mr. Fleming.</i>

1177
01:03:11.238 --> 01:03:12.773
<i>Jane's on crowd control.</i>

1178
01:03:12.907 --> 01:03:15.209
<i>Turkish derby attracts
thousands of spectators</i>

1179
01:03:15.342 --> 01:03:17.611
<i>who need to be scanned
and assessed.</i>

1180
01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.416
<i>Start low, go high.</i>

1181
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:23.784
<i>From your nest,</i>

1182
01:03:23.918 --> 01:03:25.419
<i>you can provide
tactical support.</i>

1183
01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:29.055
<i>Take out any threats
to the operation.</i>

1184
01:03:29.189 --> 01:03:31.492
<i>Sabina, you'll run
the ground game.</i>

1185
01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:33.828
<i>Once the target's on site,
you make the grab.</i>

1186
01:03:33.961 --> 01:03:36.763
<i>We need Fleming,
his buyer and Calisto.</i>

1187
01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:38.166
<i>No loose ends.</i>

1188
01:03:41.335 --> 01:03:43.003
<i>I'll take care
of the transportation</i>

1189
01:03:43.136 --> 01:03:44.705
<i>and prep for extraction.</i>

1190
01:03:44.839 --> 01:03:46.874
<i>We're taking everybody
out of there with us.</i>

1191
01:03:47.008 --> 01:03:49.376
<i>I have just the vehicle to do it.</i>

1192
01:03:49.509 --> 01:03:52.647
Okay, and I'm in.

1193
01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:57.985
Hey, Jane.

1194
01:03:58.118 --> 01:04:00.354
Ah, there you are.

1195
01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:05.860
Comm check. Sabina.

1196
01:04:05.993 --> 01:04:06.993
Good.

1197
01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:08.496
<i>- Jane.</i>
- Good.

1198
01:04:08.629 --> 01:04:09.864
Elena.

1199
01:04:09.865 --> 01:04:11.098
<i>Good.</i>

1200
01:04:11.232 --> 01:04:12.633
Don't talk into your bracelet.

1201
01:04:14.735 --> 01:04:16.970
I just missed a superfecta.

1202
01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:19.774
Better luck in the third run,
I hope.

1203
01:04:21.508 --> 01:04:23.177
Hey, what's your bet?

1204
01:04:24.678 --> 01:04:25.947
Um...

1205
01:04:28.416 --> 01:04:29.816
The blue one.

1206
01:04:30.851 --> 01:04:32.119
Mm.

1207
01:04:35.356 --> 01:04:37.892
Six minutes to post time.
Anybody see anything?

1208
01:04:39.359 --> 01:04:40.595
Nothing yet.

1209
01:04:44.831 --> 01:04:46.867
<i>Jane, you got anything yet?</i>

1210
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.202
Nothing.

1211
01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:59.013
Excuse me, who is that?

1212
01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:00.680
Alim Hassan.

1213
01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:01.915
Qatari prince.

1214
01:05:02.049 --> 01:05:03.334
Oh, "Qatari prince."

1215
01:05:03.335 --> 01:05:04.618
Yeah, serious money.

1216
01:05:04.752 --> 01:05:05.803
"Serious money."

1217
01:05:05.804 --> 01:05:06.854
Owns hundreds of horses.

1218
01:05:06.988 --> 01:05:08.173
"Owns hundreds of horses"?

1219
01:05:08.174 --> 01:05:09.357
Yeah.

1220
01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:11.892
<i>We get it. He's rich.</i>

1221
01:05:12.025 --> 01:05:13.594
Is he the buyer?

1222
01:05:13.727 --> 01:05:15.495
<i>I don't have an angle.</i>

1223
01:05:15.629 --> 01:05:18.199
Sabina!
Fleming.

1224
01:05:18.332 --> 01:05:20.902
<i>That's him.
Light blue suit!</i>

1225
01:05:26.173 --> 01:05:27.741
Yeah, he's here.

1226
01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:30.344
That's definitely him. Sabina?

1227
01:05:30.478 --> 01:05:31.612
Got him.

1228
01:05:33.647 --> 01:05:34.748
He has the goods.

1229
01:05:34.882 --> 01:05:36.517
Moving in.

1230
01:05:39.219 --> 01:05:40.219
Jane?

1231
01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.793
In my sights. Boz?

1232
01:05:45.926 --> 01:05:47.127
The ride is ready.

1233
01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:53.767
He's talking to somebody.
Gray suit.

1234
01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.269
Is that the buyer?

1235
01:05:59.106 --> 01:06:00.691
It's the assassin.

1236
01:06:00.692 --> 01:06:02.276
Bae showed up.

1237
01:06:02.409 --> 01:06:04.220
If you think you're
killing him before I kill him

1238
01:06:04.244 --> 01:06:05.111
I'll kill you first.

1239
01:06:05.245 --> 01:06:06.847
Take the shot, Jane. Bag him.

1240
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:11.953
In the car? All right.

1241
01:06:17.524 --> 01:06:19.126
- Oh, shit.
- They're in the Mercedes.

1242
01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:20.545
There's no sale here.

1243
01:06:20.546 --> 01:06:21.829
We gotta go! Get down here.

1244
01:06:21.962 --> 01:06:23.130
I'm coming!

1245
01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:25.766
Shit, shit!

1246
01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:27.168
Shit!

1247
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:31.738
<i>- Sabina, get a tracker
on that Mercedes!</i>

1248
01:06:31.872 --> 01:06:33.073
On it!

1249
01:06:46.086 --> 01:06:47.388
Come on! Hyah!

1250
01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.195
Come on.

1251
01:06:55.329 --> 01:06:56.497
Coming in!

1252
01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:00.566
Come on. Move, move, move.

1253
01:07:00.701 --> 01:07:02.670
<i>- Come on, Elena!</i>
- I'm coming!

1254
01:07:14.848 --> 01:07:16.150
Go, go, go!

1255
01:07:18.585 --> 01:07:19.820
Come on!

1256
01:07:47.347 --> 01:07:48.627
- Giddyup.
- Sabina!

1257
01:07:48.749 --> 01:07:50.084
- Hey, guys.
- Get in here.

1258
01:07:52.052 --> 01:07:53.419
Okay, punch it.

1259
01:07:53.554 --> 01:07:55.389
- Here we go! Great job!
- Whoo!

1260
01:07:55.522 --> 01:07:59.460
How did you...? I didn't know
you could jump horses.

1261
01:07:59.593 --> 01:08:01.028
More money, more horses.

1262
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:02.463
Huh.

1263
01:08:02.596 --> 01:08:04.899
Can somebody
please track this mofo?

1264
01:08:06.032 --> 01:08:07.601
We cannot tail him in this.

1265
01:08:09.403 --> 01:08:10.704
Hold on.

1266
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:24.552
They're headed north
out of town.

1267
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.290
We've left city limits.

1268
01:08:31.424 --> 01:08:33.928
There's nothing out here
but a rock quarry.

1269
01:08:36.329 --> 01:08:37.398
Bring up the specs.

1270
01:08:57.284 --> 01:08:59.786
I'll circle until you signal.

1271
01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.189
The sale will definitely
go down here.

1272
01:09:02.322 --> 01:09:04.792
Let's take everything.
We don't know who's in there.

1273
01:09:04.925 --> 01:09:07.128
I-I think
I'm a little overdressed.

1274
01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:12.098
Okay, um...

1275
01:09:12.232 --> 01:09:13.667
You need this.

1276
01:09:29.148 --> 01:09:30.483
I see a way in.

1277
01:09:30.617 --> 01:09:33.120
Ja... Jane! Jane!

1278
01:09:38.892 --> 01:09:40.027
Come on.

1279
01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:02.249
Huh?

1280
01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.855
In your dreams.

1281
01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:14.594
Hi.

1282
01:10:18.999 --> 01:10:21.702
Hey, he's gonna wake up.
Come on.

1283
01:10:27.174 --> 01:10:28.642
You've got all the dots.

1284
01:10:28.776 --> 01:10:30.543
I signaled you, you went rogue.

1285
01:10:30.677 --> 01:10:31.745
Should we toss him?

1286
01:10:31.746 --> 01:10:32.813
Yeah, let's do it.

1287
01:10:38.685 --> 01:10:41.321
Man. Whoever Fleming's
in business with,

1288
01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:43.357
he is in way over his head.

1289
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.360
Seal that gate.
Lock them in.

1290
01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:47.661
Then lock yourself in here.

1291
01:10:47.662 --> 01:10:48.829
Okay.

1292
01:10:49.963 --> 01:10:50.998
These are for you.

1293
01:10:52.633 --> 01:10:54.100
They are not mints.

1294
01:10:54.234 --> 01:10:55.418
You got it?

1295
01:10:55.419 --> 01:10:56.602
Not mints.

1296
01:10:56.737 --> 01:10:58.438
- Let's go.
- Lock this. Not mints.

1297
01:10:58.572 --> 01:10:59.939
- No, I know.
- Lock it!

1298
01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:18.124
Okay, the gate is locked. Only
other exit is up three stories.

1299
01:11:18.258 --> 01:11:19.593
Nicely done, Elena.

1300
01:11:39.746 --> 01:11:41.448
There he is.

1301
01:11:41.582 --> 01:11:42.766
Mr. Fleming.

1302
01:11:42.767 --> 01:11:43.950
Yes.

1303
01:11:44.084 --> 01:11:45.586
That's Australian Jonny.

1304
01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:47.587
Didn't we hand him
over to the Americans?

1305
01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.722
Well, he's here.

1306
01:11:48.855 --> 01:11:50.491
If you think
you're gonna kill me

1307
01:11:50.624 --> 01:11:51.925
before I kill him...

1308
01:11:53.293 --> 01:11:54.594
What was the thing you said?

1309
01:11:54.728 --> 01:11:57.664
So, uh, you are...?

1310
01:11:57.797 --> 01:12:00.433
I represent a buyer
who wishes to remain anonymous.

1311
01:12:00.567 --> 01:12:01.869
Ah.

1312
01:12:02.002 --> 01:12:03.270
Let's have a look.

1313
01:12:03.271 --> 01:12:04.538
Of course.

1314
01:12:06.273 --> 01:12:07.674
<i>Guys, that's Calisto.</i>

1315
01:12:07.808 --> 01:12:09.643
There we go.

1316
01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:13.879
The money?

1317
01:12:14.014 --> 01:12:15.014
COD.

1318
01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:18.018
Plus wire transfer.

1319
01:12:20.254 --> 01:12:21.321
Great.

1320
01:12:21.455 --> 01:12:23.189
But before we close the deal,

1321
01:12:23.323 --> 01:12:25.492
my employer would like
a little demonstration

1322
01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:29.997
just to make sure
the devices do what you say.

1323
01:12:34.334 --> 01:12:36.670
You want me to kill somebody?

1324
01:12:36.803 --> 01:12:38.171
Damn.

1325
01:12:38.305 --> 01:12:41.341
No, I don't,
but my employer insists.

1326
01:12:41.484 --> 01:12:42.725
<i>So, yes.</i>

1326b
01:12:43.219 --> 01:12:44.310
<i>Pick anybody.</i>

1327
01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:45.629
Obviously, don't pick me.

1328
01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:46.947
Uh...

1329
01:12:48.348 --> 01:12:50.000
Sidam, go get somebody.

1330
01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:51.651
Uh, no, no, no.

1331
01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:55.455
Uh, I-I-I gave you the report.

1332
01:12:55.588 --> 01:13:00.060
It's all outlined in there so,
that was never part of the deal.

1333
01:13:00.193 --> 01:13:03.397
<i>Well, Mr. Fleming, it is now.</i>

1334
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:07.167
<i>Look, it's a complicated process.
 Obviously, I don't...</i>

1335
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.169
You don't even know
how it works, do you?

1336
01:13:09.303 --> 01:13:10.904
<i>It'll require root access</i>

1337
01:13:11.038 --> 01:13:12.772
or a world-class hacker.

1338
01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.343
Whoa, whoa!

1339
01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:18.511
What are you thinking?
Bloody hell!

1340
01:13:18.645 --> 01:13:21.181
That was not part of the plan,
Mr. Hodak!

1341
01:13:22.249 --> 01:13:23.249
Damn it!

1342
01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:25.718
Boz, Fleming is down.

1343
01:13:25.852 --> 01:13:29.222
<i>The assassin works
for Jonny Smith.</i>

1344
01:13:29.356 --> 01:13:30.891
<i>Boz.</i>

1345
01:13:31.024 --> 01:13:32.726
We need to engage.
Ready for exfil?

1346
01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.763
Let's get out of here! Someone
grab that. Get me out of here.

1347
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.666
Boz, they are leaving.

1348
01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.934
<i>Go, no-go?</i>

1349
01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:44.203
Where the hell is she?

1350
01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:45.772
I can't see her anywhere.

1351
01:13:49.543 --> 01:13:50.543
It won't open.

1352
01:13:50.644 --> 01:13:52.045
Well, then fix it.

1353
01:13:52.179 --> 01:13:53.914
Go upstairs and fix it.

1354
01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:00.120
Oh, no. Guys, someone's coming.

1355
01:14:01.421 --> 01:14:02.790
<i>He's headed your way.</i>

1356
01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:24.543
Together.

1357
01:14:40.227 --> 01:14:41.762
- Up there!
- Shit.

1358
01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:45.265
- Find them!
- Oh, my God. Guys?

1359
01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:46.667
- Go!
<i>- What's happening?</i>

1360
01:14:48.268 --> 01:14:50.470
I'll take the assassin.
Cover me.

1361
01:14:50.603 --> 01:14:52.673
Go. Go, go, go!

1362
01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.989
Oh, Miss Independent.

1363
01:15:16.696 --> 01:15:18.365
Um... Uh, just a minute!

1364
01:15:18.498 --> 01:15:20.467
Um, ocupado.

1365
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.636
Whoa! Oh...

1366
01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:25.172
Who are you?

1367
01:15:25.173 --> 01:15:26.673
Gah! Oh!

1368
01:15:28.442 --> 01:15:30.644
Stay away.
I know Krav Maga.

1369
01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:32.979
Where you learn?
Shopping mall?

1370
01:15:34.147 --> 01:15:36.883
One! Two! Three!

1371
01:15:37.016 --> 01:15:38.618
Krav Maga! Yeah.

1372
01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:45.291
Don't shoot.

1373
01:15:45.425 --> 01:15:47.461
Jonny Australia,
the pleasure is all yours.

1374
01:15:51.331 --> 01:15:52.331
Come on.

1375
01:15:54.434 --> 01:15:56.169
Jane, where's
that sleepy-neck button?

1376
01:15:56.303 --> 01:15:58.071
<i>I'm a little busy.
Figure it out!</i>

1377
01:16:03.109 --> 01:16:04.544
Ooh!

1378
01:16:04.677 --> 01:16:06.246
Elena?
<i>Help me!</i>

1379
01:16:10.216 --> 01:16:11.552
Ah!

1380
01:16:22.195 --> 01:16:23.396
Thanks, Elena.

1381
01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:25.231
I have dreamed of this moment

1382
01:16:25.364 --> 01:16:27.866
since the day I met you.
Except your hair was longer.

1383
01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:29.702
But I like this too.
This is great.

1384
01:16:35.641 --> 01:16:37.110
Hey. Don't even think about it.

1385
01:16:37.111 --> 01:16:38.578
You want to run away with me?

1386
01:16:38.712 --> 01:16:40.847
Oh, you're so desperate.

1387
01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:43.116
Hey, stop right... Elena!

1388
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:44.551
I want to live to see you again!

1389
01:16:44.684 --> 01:16:46.019
<i>Elena, close the gate!</i>

1390
01:16:52.892 --> 01:16:53.892
Too late!

1391
01:17:02.569 --> 01:17:04.236
<i>Jane, where are you?!</i>

1392
01:17:04.371 --> 01:17:06.206
<i>The assassin's getting away!</i>

1393
01:17:21.621 --> 01:17:22.956
<i>Sabina!</i>

1394
01:17:25.958 --> 01:17:27.160
Uh...

1395
01:17:27.293 --> 01:17:28.362
Who are you?

1396
01:17:31.398 --> 01:17:33.132
Elena, stop this thing!

1397
01:17:33.266 --> 01:17:34.334
No!

1398
01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.170
Give me the case!

1399
01:17:44.277 --> 01:17:45.277
Oh!

1400
01:17:46.646 --> 01:17:48.015
<i>Elena?</i>

1401
01:17:49.816 --> 01:17:51.485
- Hold on!
<i>- Elena!</i>

1402
01:17:53.953 --> 01:17:54.954
Elena!

1403
01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:00.394
Oh, God. Oh, no!

1404
01:18:03.463 --> 01:18:06.533
Come on. Elena?
I need you, man! I need you!

1405
01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:11.603
Sabina, stay to the side!

1406
01:18:11.738 --> 01:18:12.939
Awesome!

1407
01:18:17.010 --> 01:18:18.945
Get me out of here!

1408
01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.214
Stop it!

1409
01:18:26.752 --> 01:18:28.120
Elena!

1410
01:18:30.323 --> 01:18:33.193
<i>It's about to get
very crush-y in here!</i>

1411
01:18:35.661 --> 01:18:37.297
Jane, we need you!

1412
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:38.531
I've nearly got it!

1413
01:18:38.665 --> 01:18:40.667
<i>Jane, hurry!</i>

1414
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.868
<i>Jane!</i>

1415
01:18:50.009 --> 01:18:51.344
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

1416
01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:54.981
Sabina,

1417
01:18:55.115 --> 01:18:56.249
<i>reach up.</i>

1418
01:19:03.522 --> 01:19:05.825
Jane! Jane!

1419
01:19:05.959 --> 01:19:07.894
This one! This one! There!

1420
01:19:14.501 --> 01:19:16.202
Oh, thank God.

1421
01:19:23.776 --> 01:19:24.777
Oh, God.

1422
01:19:24.911 --> 01:19:26.412
You all right, Sabina?!

1423
01:19:26.546 --> 01:19:28.280
Yeah. Better late than never.

1424
01:19:36.256 --> 01:19:38.091
Ha!

1425
01:19:38.225 --> 01:19:39.892
Oh, it's the wrong side.

1426
01:19:45.731 --> 01:19:47.933
Hey, did the rookie just tranq herself?

1427
01:19:48.067 --> 01:19:49.336
Yup.

1428
01:19:51.037 --> 01:19:52.672
Where's your boyfriend?

1429
01:19:52.806 --> 01:19:54.441
Hodak. The assassin?

1430
01:19:54.442 --> 01:19:56.076
Gone.

1431
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:57.944
Took Calisto with him.

1432
01:19:58.078 --> 01:19:59.296
Where's Jonny?

1433
01:19:59.297 --> 01:20:00.513
He scurried off.

1434
01:20:00.647 --> 01:20:02.749
He's a little bitch.

1435
01:20:02.882 --> 01:20:04.351
Where's Boz?

1436
01:20:09.122 --> 01:20:10.590
We probably shouldn't be caught

1437
01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:12.124
standing over a dead body.

1438
01:20:12.258 --> 01:20:14.728
Not dressed like this, no.

1439
01:20:39.285 --> 01:20:40.620
Is she dead?

1440
01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.491
You want to touch her?

1441
01:20:45.825 --> 01:20:47.460
Come on.

1442
01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:48.593
Touch her.

1443
01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:53.433
She feels alive!

1444
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.936
You woke her up.

1445
01:20:57.837 --> 01:20:59.806
Hey, you.

1446
01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:01.441
Are we on a boat?

1447
01:21:02.808 --> 01:21:03.808
Yeah.

1448
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:05.679

1449
01:21:07.447 --> 01:21:10.216

- Bosley!
- Boz?

1456
01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:29.870
Mrs. Bosley?

1457
01:21:35.675 --> 01:21:36.710
Boz.

1458
01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:39.346
Do Bosleys usually leave?

1459
01:21:40.813 --> 01:21:42.349
No, this is all wrong.

1460
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:45.168
So she's gone?

1461
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:46.585
Well, we were made,

1462
01:21:46.719 --> 01:21:48.288
so maybe she wanted
to do a sweep.

1463
01:21:50.089 --> 01:21:51.224
Maybe.

1464
01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:54.628
Or she's...

1465
01:21:56.562 --> 01:21:59.732
What? No.
Boz was the first Angel

1466
01:21:59.865 --> 01:22:01.934
to be promoted to Bosley.
She's one of us.

1467
01:22:02.068 --> 01:22:04.303
She would not be
the first Angel to turn.

1468
01:22:04.437 --> 01:22:06.205
It's happened.
You know the history.

1469
01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:08.574
It was her idea to steal Calisto
from the lab.

1470
01:22:08.708 --> 01:22:11.044
Exactly.
But Fleming beat her to it.

1471
01:22:11.177 --> 01:22:14.080
It's been our mission the entire
time to get this thing back,

1472
01:22:14.213 --> 01:22:16.449
and it just keeps
slipping us, like...

1473
01:22:16.583 --> 01:22:20.053
We're better than that.
It's... It's her.

1474
01:22:20.186 --> 01:22:22.355
Fleming's dead.
Calisto's gone.

1475
01:22:23.423 --> 01:22:24.958
And so is she.

1476
01:22:26.392 --> 01:22:28.728
Jonny said
he represented somebody...

1477
01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:30.230
What if it's Boz?

1478
01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:36.436
That's my room.

1479
01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:44.044
Hello?

1480
01:22:44.044 --> 01:22:45.751
<i>Charlie sends love.</i>

1480b
01:22:45.838 --> 01:22:46.874
You're in grave danger.

1481
01:22:46.947 --> 01:22:48.031
<i>Get out of there now!</i>

1482
01:22:48.032 --> 01:22:49.115
Guys?

1483
01:23:08.601 --> 01:23:10.170
Jane?

1484
01:23:23.849 --> 01:23:25.985
Elena, stay down! Stay down!

1485
01:23:26.118 --> 01:23:27.553
Elena, stay down! Stay down!

1486
01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:38.130
I'm Bosley.

1487
01:23:38.264 --> 01:23:40.499
Let's get you out of here.

1488
01:23:40.633 --> 01:23:42.168
Quickly.

1489
01:24:20.173 --> 01:24:21.241
Sabina?

1490
01:24:24.377 --> 01:24:26.344
Sabina.

1491
01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:27.881
Sabina.

1492
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:39.726
Hey. Sabina.

1493
01:24:58.044 --> 01:24:59.679
She means a lot to you.

1494
01:25:00.913 --> 01:25:02.948
We're new friends.

1495
01:25:03.082 --> 01:25:04.350
I think.

1496
01:25:06.585 --> 01:25:09.422
It's been a really tough week.

1497
01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:17.129
I can't lose her too.

1498
01:25:30.576 --> 01:25:32.078
What are you doing?

1499
01:25:32.211 --> 01:25:34.180
Oh! Oh, God.

1500
01:25:34.313 --> 01:25:35.498
Ow!

1501
01:25:35.499 --> 01:25:36.682
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1502
01:25:36.816 --> 01:25:37.816
I'm so sorry.

1503
01:25:39.952 --> 01:25:41.754
Why are you crying?

1504
01:25:41.888 --> 01:25:44.491
Oh, I'm not crying. Heh.

1505
01:25:45.892 --> 01:25:47.427
Well, you are. That's...

1506
01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.761
That's what's...

1507
01:25:50.963 --> 01:25:53.032
Okay, fine, yeah, I'm crying.

1508
01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:57.670
But I didn't think that you...

1509
01:25:57.803 --> 01:25:59.004
cared about me.

1510
01:25:59.138 --> 01:26:00.940
Why?

1511
01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:02.441
Because...

1512
01:26:02.575 --> 01:26:04.777
Because you don't think
I have any feelings.

1513
01:26:04.911 --> 01:26:06.613
No, I...

1514
01:26:08.347 --> 01:26:11.117
I can be really annoying.

1515
01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:12.951
Most of the time.

1516
01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:15.187
You can be so annoying.

1517
01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:16.989
I don't try to be.
It just sort of...

1518
01:26:17.122 --> 01:26:19.125
I don't have the filter thing
people have.

1519
01:26:22.695 --> 01:26:24.163
- Hey.
- I don't know

1520
01:26:24.296 --> 01:26:27.699
What this is made of,
but it saved your life.

1521
01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:29.969
Thanks.

1522
01:26:30.103 --> 01:26:31.604
Where's Elena?

1523
01:26:31.738 --> 01:26:33.139
I don't know.

1524
01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:36.142
We have to find her,
so I called in for some help.

1525
01:26:36.275 --> 01:26:37.810
Because I got blown up?

1526
01:26:37.811 --> 01:26:39.344
Yeah.

1527
01:26:41.247 --> 01:26:43.482
But also because...

1528
01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:46.886
you convinced me I don't
have to do everything by myself.

1529
01:26:47.019 --> 01:26:48.220
Well done.

1530
01:26:49.922 --> 01:26:53.158
Hello, Angels.
You owe me an explanation.

1531
01:26:53.292 --> 01:26:55.628
This is not Brazil.

1532
01:26:55.761 --> 01:26:56.896
Hey.

1533
01:26:56.897 --> 01:26:58.030
I brought supplies.

1534
01:26:58.164 --> 01:26:59.998
Homemade kombucha
with probiotics.

1535
01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:01.700
And the best part...

1536
01:27:01.834 --> 01:27:03.369
I brought a friend.

1537
01:27:03.502 --> 01:27:04.503
- You.
- You trai...

1538
01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:06.205
- Hey!
- Jane.

1539
01:27:06.338 --> 01:27:07.640
I'm not the mole.

1540
01:27:07.773 --> 01:27:08.773
Then why are you here?

1541
01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:10.810
The same reason you are.

1542
01:27:10.943 --> 01:27:12.879
I should be dead.

1543
01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:19.084
She called me
right after you did.

1544
01:27:19.218 --> 01:27:21.320
I have an herbal compress
for the bruises.

1545
01:27:21.454 --> 01:27:22.855
Nobody wants that.

1546
01:27:22.856 --> 01:27:24.255
Okay. Keep your bruises.

1547
01:27:24.389 --> 01:27:25.858
So then who?

1548
01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:28.578
Make yourself at home.

1549
01:27:28.579 --> 01:27:29.696
Thank you.

1550
01:27:32.098 --> 01:27:33.699
I had some clothes sent up.

1551
01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.368
Take your pick.

1552
01:27:38.871 --> 01:27:41.707
Um, why so formal?

1553
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:44.777
I'm sorry, is this
another headquarters?

1554
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:48.380
Have you heard from Jane
and Sabina? Will they come?

1555
01:27:48.514 --> 01:27:50.416
So inquisitive.

1556
01:27:50.549 --> 01:27:52.451
Curiosity of a cat.

1557
01:27:52.585 --> 01:27:54.153
Or a ferret.

1558
01:27:54.286 --> 01:27:56.055
It's the scientist in you,
isn't it?

1559
01:27:57.957 --> 01:28:00.258
Just trying
to understand my situation.

1560
01:28:00.392 --> 01:28:04.263
You wanted an audience with
Mr. Brok to discuss Calisto.

1561
01:28:04.396 --> 01:28:06.966
Well, soon you'll have one.

1562
01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.301
But Calisto's
been stolen now, so I...

1563
01:28:23.115 --> 01:28:24.617
Well done.

1564
01:28:26.652 --> 01:28:29.588
Satisfying when a plan
comes together.

1565
01:28:29.722 --> 01:28:32.425
We'll give you some privacy.

1566
01:28:33.592 --> 01:28:34.927
Oh, my...

1567
01:28:38.898 --> 01:28:40.016
No way.

1568
01:28:40.017 --> 01:28:41.133
Oh, yes.

1569
01:28:41.267 --> 01:28:42.769
I've been tracking him
for weeks.

1570
01:28:42.902 --> 01:28:44.270
<i>When he landed in Istanbul,</i>

1571
01:28:44.403 --> 01:28:45.971
<i>I knew I needed to get to him</i>

1572
01:28:46.105 --> 01:28:47.673
<i>before he got to you.</i>

1573
01:28:47.807 --> 01:28:50.310
<i>- Boz, they are leaving.
- Go, no-go?</i>

1574
01:28:52.945 --> 01:28:54.279
<i>Boz.</i>

1575                                           
01:28:54.413 --> 01:28:55.647
Damn it!

1576
01:28:55.781 --> 01:28:57.620
<i>I'm sorry I left
the quarry, but...</i>

1577
01:28:58.150 --> 01:29:00.018
more sorry I was too late.

1578
01:29:00.152 --> 01:29:03.155
I just can't believe that.
A Bosley?

1579
01:29:03.289 --> 01:29:05.958
Mm, you had no trouble
believing it was me.

1580
01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:07.109
You heard that?

1581
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:08.127
Mm.

1582
01:29:08.261 --> 01:29:10.262
Australian Jonny.

1583
01:29:10.396 --> 01:29:11.847
The one that got away.

1584
01:29:11.848 --> 01:29:13.298
Yeah, again.

1585
01:29:13.432 --> 01:29:14.967
The last time we saw him,

1586
01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.318
we were in Rio, and then...

1587
01:29:16.319 --> 01:29:17.535
You pushed me off a roof.

1588
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:19.705
- You have got to get over that.
- Oh, my God.

1589
01:29:19.838 --> 01:29:22.374
I am. Just processing.

1590
01:29:22.508 --> 01:29:24.676
So then the last person
to see him was...

1591
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:26.378
- Was Bosley.
- Exactly.

1592
01:29:26.512 --> 01:29:28.047
When Jonny
didn't make it to jail,

1593
01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.015
Charlie suspected
Bosley had gone rogue.

1594
01:29:30.148 --> 01:29:32.285
It turns out
he's building his own network,

1595
01:29:32.418 --> 01:29:34.453
selling his services
to the highest bidders.

1596
01:29:34.586 --> 01:29:36.254
He's using us
to date criminals now?

1597
01:29:36.388 --> 01:29:41.260
Yeah. Jonny, Mr. Hodak, that
assassin, they work for Bosley.

1598
01:29:41.393 --> 01:29:43.763
He always seemed like
kind of a weirdo.

1599
01:29:43.896 --> 01:29:45.732
Freaky. English.

1600
01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:48.901
- So Bosley has Elena.
- Mm-hm.

1601
01:29:49.034 --> 01:29:50.035
Do we know where?

1602
01:29:50.036 --> 01:29:51.036
Of course we know.

1603
01:29:51.170 --> 01:29:53.839
There's trackers
in most of the clothes.

1604
01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:56.508
You have a lot of leather
jackets at your apartment.

1605
01:29:56.642 --> 01:29:59.678
- See, I told you it was borrow and not take.
- Shh shh...

1606
01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:03.281
Alexander Brok is hosting a party
at his compound. Elena's there.

1607
01:30:06.219 --> 01:30:08.855
<i>Every year, he brings together
the wealthy and beautiful</i>

1608
01:30:08.988 --> 01:30:11.523
<i>for his annual Vision Party.</i>

1609
01:30:11.657 --> 01:30:14.693
<i>This year, he's planning to
present Calisto to his investors.</i>

1610
01:30:14.827 --> 01:30:16.963
Why would Bosley want
to take Elena to Brok?

1611
01:30:17.096 --> 01:30:20.633
Bringing the Birdman
back to Alcatraz, I guess.

1612
01:30:21.767 --> 01:30:22.969
The who?

1613
01:30:24.403 --> 01:30:26.272
It's a movie.
Burt Lancaster.

1614
01:30:26.405 --> 01:30:28.306
Birdman. Michael Keaton.

1615
01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.925
No, Michael Keaton is Batman.

1616
01:30:29.926 --> 01:30:31.410
No, Ben Affleck is Batman.

1617
01:30:31.544 --> 01:30:33.379
I mean, is he?

1618
01:30:33.513 --> 01:30:36.249
Am I the only person here
who knows who Burt Lancaster is?

1619
01:30:36.382 --> 01:30:37.783
- I'm concussed.
- Doesn't matter.

1620
01:30:37.916 --> 01:30:40.119
- It's an old movie. It's from...
- How old are you?

1621
01:30:40.252 --> 01:30:42.620
How old am I? What?
That has nothing to do with it.

1622
01:30:42.755 --> 01:30:43.923
I don't have your references.

1623
01:30:43.924 --> 01:30:45.091
There are film buffs

1624
01:30:45.224 --> 01:30:46.326
of all ages.

1625
01:30:46.327 --> 01:30:47.427
Let's go get our girl.

1626
01:30:53.499 --> 01:30:54.967
What do you want with me?

1627
01:31:12.718 --> 01:31:14.987
Did you raid
your mom's closet for this?

1628
01:31:16.522 --> 01:31:18.657
What else of hers
do you play with?

1629
01:31:26.365 --> 01:31:30.969
I've spent an entire career
estimating the talents of women.

1630
01:31:31.103 --> 01:31:34.139
And you, my dear,

1631
01:31:34.273 --> 01:31:36.642
are marvelously clever.

1632
01:31:37.809 --> 01:31:39.111
You betrayed them.

1633
01:31:39.245 --> 01:31:41.013
You betrayed the Angels.

1634
01:31:41.146 --> 01:31:44.016
Well, I no longer work
for the Townsend Agency.

1635
01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:47.052
I was retired.

1636
01:31:47.186 --> 01:31:51.190
So you are going to show me

1637
01:31:51.323 --> 01:31:54.827
how to hack this
and reprogram root access...

1638
01:31:55.928 --> 01:31:57.396
to me.

1639
01:31:57.530 --> 01:31:59.698
You thought Fleming could do it.

1640
01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:01.734
He always had a habit
of claiming credit

1641
01:32:01.867 --> 01:32:03.402
he didn't deserve.

1642
01:32:03.535 --> 01:32:04.786
How long will it take?

1643
01:32:04.787 --> 01:32:06.037
Forever. I'm not touching it.

1644
01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:10.876
Ha, ha, you think
you have a choice.

1645
01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:12.544
It's adorable.

1646
01:32:12.678 --> 01:32:15.147
They'll send...
They'll send love.

1647
01:32:18.517 --> 01:32:20.886
They'll send love.

1648
01:32:22.321 --> 01:32:25.524

This is a private floor.

1689
01:34:24.676 --> 01:34:26.812
I'm just turned around.
This place is huge.

1690
01:34:26.946 --> 01:34:28.480
I was looking for the bathroom.

1691
01:34:28.614 --> 01:34:30.616
It's just that
I really need to pee.

1692
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:33.219

I thought may...

1693
01:34:36.121 --> 01:34:37.323
Sweet dreams.

01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:40.660
We're in.

01:34:41.694 --> 01:34:43.128
Why are you doing this?

1696
01:34:43.262 --> 01:34:46.865
To neutralize an enemy
discreetly and anonymously.

1697
01:34:46.999 --> 01:34:49.301
That's a gold standard
in my business.

1698
01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:52.304
What you deem a flaw,
I deem a gift.

1699
01:34:52.437 --> 01:34:56.541
One that not only
provides power...

1700
01:34:56.675 --> 01:34:58.344
but confers it as well.

1701
01:35:01.113 --> 01:35:02.948
Whoa, what are you doing
in my office?

1702
01:35:03.082 --> 01:35:05.517
Mr. Brok? Oh, my God.
Thank God. Please help me.

1703
01:35:05.651 --> 01:35:07.286
- What is she doing here?
- These men...

1704
01:35:11.256 --> 01:35:14.459
John, I'm a little confused.
I thought you handled her.

1705
01:35:14.593 --> 01:35:16.462
Handled me?

1706
01:35:19.431 --> 01:35:20.531
It was you?

1707
01:35:20.666 --> 01:35:22.868
You wanted to sabotage me.

1708
01:35:23.001 --> 01:35:25.137
What were you expecting,
flowers?

1709
01:35:25.271 --> 01:35:26.906
A handwritten thank-you note?

1710
01:35:28.507 --> 01:35:30.909
Get rid of her already.

1711
01:35:31.042 --> 01:35:34.413
Actually, I believe
that she can still prove useful.

1712
01:35:34.547 --> 01:35:37.400
Do you even know who he is?

1713
01:35:37.401 --> 01:35:40.252
Yes. My global security chief.

1714
01:35:40.385 --> 01:35:43.321
John's just recovered Calisto
from Peter Fleming,

1715
01:35:43.455 --> 01:35:45.257
that shortsighted,
greedy traitor.

1716
01:35:45.391 --> 01:35:47.726
They killed him.
They killed Fleming.

1717
01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.527
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la-la-la!

1718
01:35:49.662 --> 01:35:51.363
This is the problem
with you, right?

1719
01:35:51.497 --> 01:35:54.266
You keep telling me shit
I can't know.

1720
01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.369
Plausible deniability.
You ever heard of it?

1721
01:35:57.502 --> 01:35:58.770
You're a terrible employee.

1722
01:35:58.904 --> 01:36:00.772
Yeah, and who cares
if people die, right?

1723
01:36:00.906 --> 01:36:02.474
As long as the investors
are happy.

1724
01:36:02.608 --> 01:36:03.809
Grow up, little girl.

1725
01:36:03.942 --> 01:36:06.211
Calisto is about
to change the world.

1726
01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:09.981
If you want to bake a cake,
you got to break a few eggs.

1727
01:36:10.115 --> 01:36:12.818
It's omelet. If you're gonna
compare dead people to eggs,

1728
01:36:12.952 --> 01:36:15.153
could you at least use
the correct phrase?

1729
01:36:15.287 --> 01:36:18.624
I shouldn't be here, ha, ha.
You're a security threat.

1730
01:36:18.757 --> 01:36:21.159
You take care of her
and finish what you started.

1731
01:36:21.293 --> 01:36:22.795
That's exactly the plan.

1732
01:36:25.865 --> 01:36:27.666
Oh, excuse me.
I have a party to host.

1733
01:36:29.134 --> 01:36:31.270
Yo, Tats, move.

1734
01:36:31.271 --> 01:36:33.405
Take a seat, Mr. Brok.

1735
01:36:35.074 --> 01:36:36.641
Uh, no.

1736
01:36:36.775 --> 01:36:39.478
Sorry, what
the hell's happening here?

1737
01:36:39.611 --> 01:36:40.946
Oh, my God.

1738
01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.649
Let me out now.

1739
01:36:47.252 --> 01:36:48.987
Sorry, you work for me.

1740
01:36:49.121 --> 01:36:52.224
All right,
all of you work for me!

1741
01:36:54.226 --> 01:36:55.460
You dumb-ass. Ha, ha.

1742
01:36:55.594 --> 01:36:57.162
Why are you laughing?

1743
01:36:57.295 --> 01:36:58.964
You idiot.

1744
01:36:59.097 --> 01:37:01.433
They're stealing
Calisto from you.

1745
01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:05.670
They're gonna use it as
a weapon. To assassinate people.

into the market as planned.

1762
01:37:54.519 --> 01:37:57.022
In fact, the more units
there are out there

1763
01:37:57.155 --> 01:37:59.158
for me to hack into, the better.

1764
01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:00.892
Don't do it.
They've killed everyone

1765
01:38:01.026 --> 01:38:03.395
who knows about this
except you and me.

1766
01:38:03.528 --> 01:38:06.832
Mr. Brok is complicit
in the deaths of two people.

1767
01:38:06.965 --> 01:38:08.534
Oh...

1768
01:38:08.535 --> 01:38:10.102
Now, I am very happy

1769
01:38:10.235 --> 01:38:13.339

in law enforcement.

Ah, whoa, whoa!

1819
01:40:56.869 --> 01:40:59.036
What are you doing?
It will kill us.

1820
01:40:59.171 --> 01:41:01.006
Don't be daft.
It will kill her.

1821
01:41:01.139 --> 01:41:04.376
And what's-his-name. Not us.

1822
01:41:04.509 --> 01:41:08.012
We're gonna be downstairs
enjoying your party. Come on.

1823
01:41:08.146 --> 01:41:11.649
You want me to go down there
and pretend everything's fine?

1824
01:41:11.783 --> 01:41:13.151
Everything is fine.

1825
01:41:13.285 --> 01:41:16.721
You're gonna disrupt
the power industry!

1826
01:41:16.855 --> 01:41:18.524
Go, you.

1827
01:41:18.657 --> 01:41:21.994
You know, retirement
is better than I expected.

1828
01:41:30.802 --> 01:41:33.204
I'm so sorry, Langston.
Oh, God!

1829
01:41:33.338 --> 01:41:34.871
Ah!

1830
01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:36.441
That guy is a total dick.

1831
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:47.135
Did you get it?

1832
01:41:47.136 --> 01:41:48.720
Yeah, girl, I got you.

1833
01:41:48.853 --> 01:41:50.189
Of course I got it.

1834
01:41:53.691 --> 01:41:55.426
Have fun, guys.

1835
01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.962
See ya!

1836
01:42:02.667 --> 01:42:04.268
- Excuse me. Sorry!
- Hey.

1837
01:42:04.402 --> 01:42:06.905
Whoop! Yow!

1838
01:42:07.038 --> 01:42:10.142
This is your party, Alex.
Enjoy it.

1839
01:42:12.610 --> 01:42:15.179
The world is on fire, Alex.

1840
01:42:15.313 --> 01:42:18.417
But I'm sure your generation
is gonna figure it out.

1841
01:42:22.587 --> 01:42:24.590
Hey, help us!

1842
01:42:24.591 --> 01:42:26.592
There must be a key somewhere.

1843
01:42:28.827 --> 01:42:30.963
You see, it was
my mentor, Edgar,

1844
01:42:31.096 --> 01:42:33.130
who taught me
how to win a fight.

1845
01:42:33.264 --> 01:42:36.468
You thought you beat me
twice before? No.

1846
01:42:36.601 --> 01:42:37.869
I was learning.

1847
01:43:02.294 --> 01:43:04.329
You've got seven moves,
Mr. Hodak.

1848
01:43:11.235 --> 01:43:12.704
I know them all.

1849
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:33.858
Seven moves...

1850
01:43:33.991 --> 01:43:35.060
and a fragile ego.

1851
01:43:44.269 --> 01:43:47.039
Why is this happening?!

1852
01:43:59.785 --> 01:44:00.836
Got her.

1853
01:44:00.837 --> 01:44:01.887
<i>Good job.</i>

1854
01:44:03.321 --> 01:44:05.257
- Yes! Oh, ho, ho!
- Sabina! Oh, my God.

1855
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:06.558
You came for me.

1856
01:44:06.559 --> 01:44:07.726
Look at you.

1857
01:44:07.859 --> 01:44:09.144
Why is that thing doing that?

1858
01:44:09.145 --> 01:44:10.428
Oh, that? That's nothing.

1859
01:44:10.562 --> 01:44:12.898
I just programmed it
to light up and make noises.

1860
01:44:15.199 --> 01:44:16.366
You two, with me.

1861
01:44:18.603 --> 01:44:20.872
- Directly to the exit, please.
- Get this man help.

1862
01:44:21.006 --> 01:44:24.576
Calm down. Get out.
Everybody go.

1863
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:26.211
Just get out.

1864
01:44:31.216 --> 01:44:33.418
Do you really think
you'd kill me, old badger?

1865
01:44:33.552 --> 01:44:35.920
You know, Rebecca, I really did.

1866
01:44:38.123 --> 01:44:40.124
My name is Bosley,

1867
01:44:40.258 --> 01:44:41.660
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

1868
01:44:45.964 --> 01:44:48.667
You expect me to go quietly
after 40 years?

1869
01:44:51.602 --> 01:44:53.971
This is what I do.

1870
01:45:08.086 --> 01:45:09.588
You're outmanned, Angel.

1871
01:45:10.621 --> 01:45:12.457
You always have been.

1872
01:45:14.759 --> 01:45:16.328
Kill her.

1873
01:45:19.264 --> 01:45:20.832
Send the love.

1874
01:45:53.164 --> 01:45:54.164
Ingrid?

1875
01:46:10.482 --> 01:46:11.850
You've been busy.

1876
01:46:11.983 --> 01:46:13.652
How did you...?

1877
01:46:14.719 --> 01:46:16.655
It's just business, John.

1878
01:46:19.991 --> 01:46:21.159
He's with me now.

1879
01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:23.093
I see.

1880
01:46:23.227 --> 01:46:26.931
You know, I built this agency
from the ground up.

1881
01:46:27.064 --> 01:46:30.268
It was supposed to be mine
after Charlie died.

1882
01:46:30.402 --> 01:46:32.570
I was pushed out.

1883
01:46:32.704 --> 01:46:37.275
What did you expect me to do?
Take up gardening?

1884
01:46:37.409 --> 01:46:40.844
You thought you made us.
We made you.

1885
01:46:40.979 --> 01:46:42.664
Yeah, we trusted you, you dick.

1886
01:46:42.665 --> 01:46:44.349
Good nigh...

1887
01:46:44.482 --> 01:46:46.051
I was in the middle
of my speech.

1888
01:46:46.184 --> 01:46:47.386
Sorry.

1889
01:46:48.519 --> 01:46:49.688
All right, well...

1890
01:46:49.821 --> 01:46:53.058
Sweep it clean, Angels.
Good job.

1891
01:46:59.831 --> 01:47:03.768
So you want to go to California
and train to be an Angel?

1892
01:47:03.901 --> 01:47:05.603
What? I...

1893
01:47:05.737 --> 01:47:07.638
Really? You...

1894
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:12.995
Oh, my God.

1895
01:47:12.996 --> 01:47:14.079
We are recruiting you.

1896
01:47:14.212 --> 01:47:15.780
To be an Angel like...

1897
01:47:15.914 --> 01:47:17.415
- you and Jane?
- Let's go.

1898
01:47:17.549 --> 01:47:19.450
What do you think we've been doing?

1899
01:47:19.584 --> 01:47:20.685
I don't know.

1900
01:47:20.818 --> 01:47:21.962
I thought you were smart.

1901
01:47:21.986 --> 01:47:23.888
Isn't that your thing?

1902
01:47:24.022 --> 01:47:25.457
<i>It's done, Charlie.</i>

1903
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:28.059
<i>And I decided what to do
with Elena Houghlin.</i>

1904
01:47:28.192 --> 01:47:29.244
<i>What's that?</i>

1905
01:47:29.245 --> 01:47:30.295
<i>She's our new recruit.</i>

1906
01:47:30.428 --> 01:47:31.863
Good. Thank you, Boz.

1907
01:47:31.996 --> 01:47:33.473
<i>Thank you, Boz.</i>

1908
01:47:33.497 --> 01:47:34.899
I appreciate the call.

1909
01:47:35.032 --> 01:47:36.477
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

1910
01:47:38.203 --> 01:47:39.738
What do you do in California?

1911
01:47:39.739 --> 01:47:41.272
Ever jumped out of a plane?

1912
01:47:41.406 --> 01:47:42.591
I don't really do heights.

1913
01:47:42.592 --> 01:47:43.775
Oh, um...

1914
01:47:43.908 --> 01:47:45.776
- Have you swam with sharks?
- Hey! It's you.

1915
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:47.445
How long can you
hold your breath?

1916
01:47:47.579 --> 01:47:49.447
Sharks? Not long.

1917
01:47:49.581 --> 01:47:50.915
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

1918
01:47:51.048 --> 01:47:52.884
What happened to you?

1919
01:47:53.017 --> 01:47:55.253
Wait, you guys know each other?

1920
01:47:55.387 --> 01:47:57.321
- Yeah, I was eating a sandwich.
- Yeah.

1921
01:47:57.455 --> 01:47:59.757
- I came in, and you gave me the...
- The phosphorus.

1922
01:47:59.891 --> 01:48:01.491
That's my favorite chemical.

1923
01:48:01.626 --> 01:48:02.811
Because you were...

1924
01:48:02.812 --> 01:48:03.995
Exactly, mixed with...

1925
01:48:04.128 --> 01:48:07.130
Um, did you...?

1926
01:48:07.264 --> 01:48:09.567
Did you do that?

1927
01:48:09.701 --> 01:48:11.836
Oh, uh, yeah.

1928
01:48:11.970 --> 01:48:15.005
I think he, uh,
finally got the point.

1929
01:48:15.139 --> 01:48:17.976
Is that a pun?
Because you impaled him?

1930
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:22.679
Are you doing, like, a joke
thing for the handsome nerd?

1931
01:48:22.813 --> 01:48:23.915
Of course not.

1932
01:48:23.916 --> 01:48:25.016
I mean, it's working,

1933
01:48:25.149 --> 01:48:27.384
if that is what you're doing.

1934
01:48:27.519 --> 01:48:29.554
So if I'm trying
to get in touch with you,

1935
