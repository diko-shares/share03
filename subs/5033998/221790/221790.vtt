1
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:35,900
When you came to school this morning
there were police on duty here.

2
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:43,711
They will be here all week
as a part of our anti-drug drive.

3
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:49,588
And now we're going to learn how to
deal with this problem on our own.

4
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:55,707
Welcome, Linda Wallander.
The floor is yours.

5
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:58,982
There are around
one hundred students here.

6
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:03,741
Three of you will resort
to lies, threats,

7
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:07,910
stealing and
cheating your best friend...

8
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:12,149
Just to get hold of this.

9
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:17,664
I want to talk to those three people,
the rest of you can leave.

10
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:41,027
- What's going on?
- Be here on time and you'll know.

11
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:46,748
Linda's car stalled,
so I took her to that school.

12
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:50,625
We have a missing personv
Carl Svendsen, 42 years old.

13
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:54,380
His car was found
by a bus stop on Route 10.

14
00:02:54,511 --> 00:03:01,428
His 2-year-old son was in the car,
but there were no traces of Svendsen.

15
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:07,740
- Was he the driver?
- That's our assumption for now.

16
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,784
The man's wife was committed
to the St. Lars asylum a year ago.

17
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:16,587
- Have we questioned her?
- She doesn't communicate.

18
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:21,387
Carl Svendsen was one
of the owners of a boat company.

19
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,866
I'm going to talk to them.

20
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:29,861
- Could someone take his flat?
- What's the address?

21
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:31,947
- Vinkelgatan...
- ...number 4.

22
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:39,466
Vinkelgatan, that's right
next to the school. We're on it.

23
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:46,225
"We're on it"? What's left for me,
going door-to-door?

24
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:50,105
I figured you and Svartman...

25
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:54,827
The two of them riding together...
You have to talk to Linda.

26
00:03:54,951 --> 00:04:00,389
She says she knows the rules and
that they don't have a relationship.

27
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:03,230
Don't they live together?

28
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:08,345
- Please explain the difference?
- I certainly can't.

29
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:14,387
I've spent 25 years with my wife,
if that's a relationship...

30
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:21,428
If that's all,
I'll go check out that Volvo.

31
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:28,024
Kurt... Your glasses are in your
office, I might as well read this.

32
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:34,670
Carl Svendsen had a call at 6v05 pm,
from a Ole Svendsen.

33
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:40,024
And have you forgotten that you have
a doctor's appointment in 20 minutes?

34
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,507
- Right...
- Another appointment?

35
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:47,419
They like to keep track of people
who have had heart attacks.

36
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:51,590
But they say heart attacks are
stress-related, so you'll be fine.

37
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:59,946
He had two gun licenses,
so let's check out his gun cabinet.

38
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,826
How'd it go, by the way?
Any problems passing your physical?

39
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:08,705
<i>No, I've been a good boy.</i>

40
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,507
I expect they'll give me a toy
or something for good behaviour.

41
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:18,068
I'll see you later. Thanks, Nyberg.

42
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:25,542
You mentioned some
trouble with your water-works.

43
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:30,586
Well, sometimes I have
to get up and take a leak.

44
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:35,466
You also mentioned dribbling
and that the stream was...

45
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:39,823
That's not exactly
the way I put it, but...

46
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:46,709
We ran some tests and
I'd like to take a closer look at you.

47
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:49,868
- Why?
- Well...

48
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:54,781
I believe it's just normal
prostate enlargement,

49
00:05:54,911 --> 00:06:00,543
but in order to eliminate anything
else, I'd like to take a smear test.

50
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:04,505
- When will I get the results?
- In a week's time.

51
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:09,785
- That's a bloody long wait.
- I can try to speed things up.

52
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,904
I don't think you should be worried.

53
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:19,628
If the tests show any signs of illness,
we will have zeroed in on it early...

54
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:26,429
Illness?
Are you talking about cancer?

55
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:29,543
Yes.

56
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:45,504
Strange... The day has come when I'm
glad to see police officers at school.

57
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:50,989
- It'll keep those creeps at bay.
- They know we'll be gone next week.

58
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:58,347
It's a signal to the kids, that we
know what's going on, that we care.

59
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:03,864
- Why do you have these problems?
- All schools on the coast do.

60
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:08,382
All the stuff that comes in
on the boats. The "New Europe"...

61
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:13,710
- When's the next group scheduled?
- Tomorrow, at 2:15. Are you coming?

62
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:18,302
- I really don't know.
- I hope so, you were great.

63
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:32,550
- What's up?
- I can't come along today.

64
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:36,220
- So what's new? Who is it?
- Nobody.

65
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:42,142
- Let me see.
- Don't you touch that!

66
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:05,591
Time to get some work done.

67
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:34,988
- Who is it today?
- Bob the Builder.

68
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:37,386
Shit...

69
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:26,067
- Excuse me. Do you live here?
- Yes, I do. Why?

70
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:30,309
- We're from the police.
- Do you know Carl Svendsen?

71
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:35,824
We're neighbours,
but we don't actually know each other.

72
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:39,910
- Is there something wrong?
- We'd like to get in touch with him.

73
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:42,465
Have you seen him today?

74
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:45,708
- I hear his wife is ill?
- Yes.

75
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:52,066
Ever since that business
with their daughter, you know.

76
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:59,302
The poor thing killed herself.
She was only 14.

77
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,625
- Is that you, Carl?
- No, it's the police. Who are you?

78
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:17,428
I'm Carl's father.
Have you found him?

79
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:23,023
Were things like usual when you
called? What did you talk about?

80
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:29,226
- Nothing special. Everyday events.
- Could you be more specific?

81
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:32,900
- Is it important?
- We don't know.

82
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:41,230
Nils and I had been swimming. l
wanted Carl to hang up our trunks.

83
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:45,424
- Your trunks. Anything else?
- Stefan...

84
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:49,180
It's all right.

85
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:57,826
I had left behind a plastic bag
with a towel and swim trunks...

86
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:09,700
...a newspaper and my mobile phone.

87
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:17,465
And a lottery ticket.
I didn't win anything, though.

88
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:35,144
What's his relationship
with his son like?

89
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:40,504
- Does he see him as a burden?
- No, quite the other way around.

90
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:47,264
He lives for Nils.
The boy is his life.

91
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:52,146
What about his social life?
Clubs, friends...

92
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:56,184
I don't think he sees many people.

93
00:11:56,311 --> 00:12:01,305
He mostly spends his time
with the boy.

94
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:07,540
That's what grief does to you,
life gets very heavy-going.

95
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:16,181
- Would you say he is depressed?
- That's why he was on sick leave.

96
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:22,830
But he would never
abandon Nils like that. Never!

97
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,590
Something must have happened.

98
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:31,388
- One of the rooms is locked.
- Yes, Anja's room.

99
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,706
All right if we open the door?

100
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:48,663
He hasn't touched a thing since
she died. She hung herself from that.

101
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:14,309
The sporting rifle is still here.
He took the shotgun.

102
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:20,700
The guy decides to die, so he brings
his son along for good measure?

103
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:27,543
- Why wasn't Nils with Grandpa?
- Ole was in Copenhagen for a funeral.

104
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:31,584
I just don't believe he would
leave his son in the car.

105
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:36,307
Maybe someone
forced him to leave the car.

106
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:43,746
If he had killed himself we would
have found the body.

107
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:49,070
- I want to see Ellen, Carl's wife.
- The doctors say she doesn't talk.

108
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:53,104
Go ahead. - Martinsson,
how's the search coming along?

109
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:56,780
It's been called off.

110
00:13:56,911 --> 00:14:03,430
The dogs had this training course,
so I figured we might as well...

111
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:08,671
- Where the hell is everyone else?
- Patrolling the school.

112
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:15,788
The school?
Send them to the scene of the crime.

113
00:14:15,911 --> 00:14:19,108
Do as your told, for Christ's sake!

114
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:27,265
- How did your appointment go?
- It went fine.

115
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,746
Thanks.

116
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:33,546
Forensics is finished with the car.

117
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:38,028
We found fingerprints
from Carl Svendsen,

118
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:43,305
except for on the steering wheel
and the gear shift lever.

119
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:49,540
Either the guy wears gloves, or
someone wiped those surfaces clean.

120
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:18,547
- When was this?
- A little over a year ago.

121
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:22,186
After his daughter's suicide?

122
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:26,270
He had lost interest in the business,
he wanted me to buy him out.

123
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:30,748
I hear this is the first year
that business is good.

124
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:34,864
That's right, people seem
to be able to afford things again.

125
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:39,507
But when you both ran the company
together, that wasn't the case.

126
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:43,988
And soon after he bailed out,
business started booming.

127
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:49,390
- Wasn't he bitter?
- I don't think he cared.

128
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:53,948
- There was no discord between you?
- No.

129
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:58,906
This happened over a year ago.

130
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:04,059
Jeanna, my wife.
Kurt is here on business.

131
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:10,107
- Do you know that Calle's disappeared?
- Yes, I heard it on the radio.

132
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:13,587
- Did you know him well?
- Of course.

133
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:17,829
He was a business partner and
we saw him and Ellen socially.

134
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:22,502
Our daughters were the same age
and they were always together.

135
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:26,260
Until Anja...

136
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:33,429
Do you have any idea
what might have happened to him?

137
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:39,660
Just what we always were
afraid of, that he'd kill himself.

138
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:54,662
- How much does that weigh?
- I don't know. Ten kilos or so.

139
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:59,819
Say you got caught on one, you wouldn't
be able to get loose, would you?

140
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:04,388
No, I don't think you would.

141
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:11,986
You will be around in case we need
to see you again, won't you? Bye.

142
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:06,190
Hi. Those cops... Know how long
they're going to hang around?

143
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:12,341
A week or so, I think.
Some kind of anti-drug drive.

144
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:17,181
You're new here, aren't you?
I haven't seen you around.

145
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:20,189
- Are you waiting for someone?
- Yes.

146
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:28,859
If you need to score, talk to me.
Ask for Jens.

147
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,588
- What do you mean "score"?
- Beer, smokes, other stuff...

148
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:37,703
Oh... No thanks.

149
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:44,181
See you.

150
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:50,102
- A boyfriend already?
- You're hilarious, Dad...

151
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:00,387
Hello.

152
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:04,629
- Have you seen this before?
- No.

153
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:08,664
She says you gave her the money.

154
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:13,660
What the hell?
These cost thousands of kronor.

155
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,227
- Where is she?
- In the shower.

156
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:21,708
- Been there long? What about food?
- She won't say if she's eaten.

157
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:27,781
- What do you mean?
- She never talks to us.

158
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:33,702
- Where's that counsellor's number?
- On the bulletin board.

159
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:39,064
Yes, I have discussed this with her.

160
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:45,903
She feels you're putting pressure
on her. Mainly about eating.

161
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:52,345
And according to the doctor,
she's not underweight, so...

162
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:58,262
<i>I realise it's hard. Not being able</i>
<i>to reach your child is scary.</i>

163
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:04,910
<i>But she is getting help.</i>
<i>We can't do more than that.</i>

164
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:20,586
Here. It's a gift.

165
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:29,870
Maybe we can get
that junker of yours going tonight.

166
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:35,383
Thanks.

167
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:42,143
- What's wrong?
- I was thinking about Anja's room.

168
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:46,423
What kind of person locks
the door on their dead daughter

169
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:54,390
and turns her room into a museum?
It's fucking creepy!

170
00:20:54,511 --> 00:21:00,666
- Did you see how dusty it was?
- He isn't up to it.

171
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,870
HAVE YOU SEEN CARL?

172
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:27,225
Svartman's spoken to the bus drivers
on duty the night Carl disappeared.

173
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:33,221
The last bus passed that stop
at 1:45 am and the car wasn't there.

174
00:21:33,351 --> 00:21:37,902
- So he must have gotten there later.
- Not exactly a breakthrough.

175
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:43,901
We should have searched the area
with the dogs immediately.

176
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:50,061
Listen, Ann-Britt, there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

177
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:54,821
I might have to take some time off.

178
00:21:54,951 --> 00:22:01,220
I took a smear test today.
I might have prostate cancer.

179
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:10,547
- Do they really think so?
- I'll get the results next week.

180
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:16,582
- Is there anything I can do?
- I don't think so.

181
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,748
Does Linda know?

182
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:25,867
No, and I don't want
you to tell anyone. Promise?

183
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:31,188
So now you know.

184
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:40,709
Listen, Kurt...
Are you on any kind of medication?

185
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:45,507
- I mean, can you have wine?
- I guess.

186
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:51,103
Then I think we should
have some tonight. At my place.

187
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:54,940
We'll see.

188
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:18,271
Hi.

189
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:25,749
- All right if I lie down?
- Sure. Had a bad dream?

190
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:29,585
No.

191
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:40,789
- Are you coming with me to Lund?
- What would Kurt say?

192
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:46,941
People glare at us if we stand next
to each other at the coffee machine.

193
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:52,589
- It'll only take a few hours.
- I have stuff to do too.

194
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:56,306
Please, I really
want you to go with me.

195
00:24:56,431 --> 00:25:00,219
What's the big deal?

196
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:04,663
Going to a mental hospital, it's...

197
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:13,667
All right, I'll do it. Okay?

198
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:09,864
- What did you do that for?
- What are you doing, you whore!

199
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:16,021
- Sara, report to the headmaster.
- I didn't start this!

200
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:22,067
- Go at once!
- Danne started it, I saw it all.

201
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:26,901
I'll take her
to the counsellor instead.

202
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:30,228
What are you waiting for?
Go to class!

203
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:44,389
- Is Danne the only bully?
- The other chickens don't stop him.

204
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:48,550
That's awful.
I'll keep an eye on him.

205
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:53,745
I know where he lives.
By the way, where do you live?

206
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:57,181
On the outskirts of town. Svartö.

207
00:26:57,311 --> 00:27:01,384
That's a long way.
Do you ride your bike to school?

208
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:06,824
No, I get a lift to school
and I take the bus home.

209
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:11,502
- Can you play that thing?
- Sort of.

210
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:15,544
- I take lessons three times a week.
- That means you're good!

211
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:21,860
Other kids might want
to start a band. Post a notice.

212
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:25,745
- I don't think so.
- I really think you should.

213
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:31,109
Been in another fight, Sara?

214
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:38,626
Let's go another round.
By the way, have you seen Tove today?

215
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:07,989
Tove, please... Tove, don't go!

216
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:28,029
The tracks come from
a small lorry or a pick-up.

217
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:32,144
We're checking
the local optometrist records,

218
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:35,183
and a blood sample
has been sent for analysis.

219
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:40,544
- What make of tyres is it?
- The experts will tell us that.

220
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:46,268
- And the glasses?
- The frames are commonly available.

221
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:52,227
We've got to find out what kind
of vehicles use these tyres.

222
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:57,550
Hand me those frames, will you?

223
00:29:00,191 --> 00:29:06,744
<i>- Is this it?</i>
<i>- Building 85 is over there.</i>

224
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,988
<i>Then make a right turn.</i>

225
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:19,469
- Want me to wait here?
- I want you to go with me.

226
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:28,148
- Have you been here before?
- Yes, I have.

227
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:31,547
- Okay...
- I'll tell you later. Come on.

228
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:47,227
She's barely uttered a word since she
got here, so don't get your hopes up.

229
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:50,582
She doesn't
talk to her husband either?

230
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:55,660
- What about her son?
- He sits on her lap.

231
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:59,101
She looks pleased,
but she doesn't talk.

232
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:07,620
Ellen, you have some visitors.

233
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:15,823
Hello, I'm Linda.
I'm a police officer.

234
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:20,623
They did tell you
I was coming, I hope?

235
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:27,543
Carl, your husband, has disappeared.

236
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:33,621
Nils... He's fine.
He's in good hands.

237
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:40,509
Only we don't know where your
husband is, can you help us out?

238
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:07,584
Bloody hell! It certainly
puts you off bacon for a while.

239
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:13,468
The smell when she ground
that cigarette into her hand...

240
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:21,145
- Want me to do the school gig?
- No, I'll do it.

241
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:43,302
- Who is it today?
- Funny Bunny.

242
00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:28,786
I don't know much about drugs,
but I've stayed away from them.

243
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:33,985
I never put anything in my body
if I don't know what it is.

244
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:39,310
You do need to know more than that,
though. You need knowledge.

245
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:44,744
So today we will hear
some information from the police.

246
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:47,305
Welcome, Linda Wallander.

247
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:17,821
Tove? Tove!

248
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:24,944
Go away,
there's nothing to see here.

249
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:28,950
- Who is it?
- Tove Sahlin.

250
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:31,585
I'll ride with her.

251
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:38,865
Didn't you hear me?
Get out of here. You lot, too.

252
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:47,225
A lot of people
wear glasses like these...

253
00:33:47,351 --> 00:33:50,980
...I guess. They might be his.

254
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:56,663
- Did he have this brand?
- Yes.

255
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:07,228
You know,
having to bury your own child...

256
00:34:07,351 --> 00:34:13,870
Carl had to do it,
and I might have to do it, too.

257
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:20,464
It's a timeless kind of feeling.

258
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:25,267
To me, my grown-up son Carl
will always be

259
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:29,270
the little toddler as well.

260
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:34,101
I don't know if I can handle this.

261
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:41,785
I never imagined
that Carl would go before me.

262
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:49,784
Cruel fate had already taken
little Anja and Ellen and...

263
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:58,430
And it had made Carl lose his mind.

264
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:02,390
That bit about losing his mind...

265
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:06,902
Did he ever show any signs
of depression before Anja...

266
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:15,382
No. I believe guilt
was to blame there.

267
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:22,110
He left Anja on her own
the night... she died.

268
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:30,261
- Where was he?
- He was...

269
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:34,145
He was with the other woman.

270
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:40,107
His partner's wife, Jeanna Sahlin.

271
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:04,782
Hello, Linda.

272
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:09,029
- How's she doing?
- Her condition is stable, they say.

273
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:15,306
- What had she taken?
- Rohypnol. A lot.

274
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:19,629
Her heart stopped beating.
What are you doing here?

275
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:26,190
I need to talk her father. He might
be involved in Carl's disappearance.

276
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:31,988
- You can't do that right now.
- Even if he's the murderer?

277
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:36,468
He's not going anywhere.
Do it tomorrow.

278
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:41,107
- I've got to know.
- You're worse than I thought.

279
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:44,382
I know you're supposed
to show compassion...

280
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:49,824
Right! When Mum
was in the mental institution,

281
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:55,105
that's when you should
have shown some "compassion"...

282
00:36:56,711 --> 00:37:01,739
Hello. Good. My daughter's here,
she's been drugged.

283
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:07,628
I have a few questions,
could you come with me?

284
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:20,381
The last time we spoke you said

285
00:37:20,511 --> 00:37:25,949
there were no hard feelings
between yourself and Carl.

286
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:32,624
But several people have told me you
often engaged in heated arguments.

287
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,903
He would turn up and
make a fuss about money.

288
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:41,741
He was hostile,
he felt you had cheated him.

289
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:46,387
But I hadn't.
Everything was fair and square.

290
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:49,821
You deposited 25,000 into his account
on a monthly basis.

291
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:56,743
- Only not last month. Why?
- The sum was paid in full.

292
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:59,943
Have you been
checking my banking transactions?

293
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:05,191
The man might be a victim of
a crime, so we check everything.

294
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:12,228
- Did he ever threaten you?
- I never took it seriously.

295
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:17,061
It was hard on him
to see how business improved.

296
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:23,585
So you didn't split up
due to his affair with your wife?

297
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:27,863
- How the hell do you know about that?
- Was that the reason?

298
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:36,509
Answer my question
or I'll take you down to the station.

299
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:41,307
Yes, it was.

300
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:46,346
Are you satisfied? Do you enjoy
tormenting me when I'm down?

301
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:50,350
My daughter could die.

302
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:54,589
- Couldn't you have shown some...
- ...compassion?

303
00:38:57,751 --> 00:39:04,020
- Did you kill him?
- No, I didn't kill him.

304
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:10,260
How could anyone harm a man
that's been through so much?

305
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,349
But you did want to?

306
00:39:13,471 --> 00:39:17,669
Instead, you forgave your wife
and you run the business together.

307
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,430
Yes...

308
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,267
His misfortune made us...

309
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:28,384
We realised how easily
you can lose someone

310
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:32,220
and that you need
to cherish what you have.

311
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:35,900
- May I go to my daughter now?
- Sure.

312
00:39:36,031 --> 00:39:39,262
One last questionv
Do you have an alibi for that night?

313
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:44,988
I'm part of a sleep research project.

314
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:49,150
I sleep here three nights a week,
hooked up to an EEG machine.

315
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:54,550
You can check the read-out.
May I go now?

316
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:59,300
Yes. Thank you.

317
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,421
Carl?

318
00:40:11,551 --> 00:40:14,065
Carl?

319
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:23,581
- Have you found him?
- No.

320
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:31,106
- I'd like to see Anja's room again.
- Do whatever you bloody like!

321
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:14,309
I'd like to bring this down to the
station, if it's all right with you.

322
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:18,587
I'll give you a receipt.

323
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:26,990
A word of advicev
don't drink any more tonight.

324
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:31,468
It will be hard to get up
with the boy tomorrow.

325
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,186
I won't be getting up with him.

326
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:44,541
Social Services doesn't think
Nils should be staying with me.

327
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:47,390
What? Really?

328
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:50,503
I want you to go!

329
00:43:03,991 --> 00:43:11,545
- Did you call Carl yesterday?
- I wanted to see if he was at home.

330
00:43:11,671 --> 00:43:14,868
Does Ralf know that Carl and l
were in touch?

331
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:21,180
No, and I won't tell him. So, Carl's
father answered the phone.

332
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:25,463
- You know what happened.
- Not everything.

333
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:28,947
You hung up on him. Why?

334
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:33,462
I just didn't feel up
to talking to him.

335
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:38,221
- Is the affair still on?
- No, it isn't.

336
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:41,582
When was the last time
you saw him?

337
00:43:41,711 --> 00:43:46,501
A week or so ago.
We ran into each other downtown.

338
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:51,910
- Was he his usual self?
- He isn't well, you know.

339
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:58,061
- What did you talk about?
- Tove. He knows we're concerned.

340
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:03,311
She was admitted to the hospital
for a possible eating disorder.

341
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:11,985
When your child is in trouble
and you can't help her...

342
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:18,380
- ...do you know how that feels?
- Yes, I do.

343
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:22,220
She's so evasive.

344
00:44:22,351 --> 00:44:27,869
She hardly talks to us.
She won't answer our questions,

345
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:33,668
and we found money in her room.
She won't tell us where it came from.

346
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:56,941
<i>- What if she talks?</i>
<i>- She won't.</i>

347
00:44:57,071 --> 00:45:02,384
<i>- I hear there's a new girl.</i>
<i>- Shouldn't we keep a low profile?</i>

348
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:06,868
<i>- What's the girl's name?</i>
<i>- Sara.</i>

349
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:09,983
<i>I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

350
00:45:16,271 --> 00:45:21,584
- Do you recognise this guy?
- No, who is it?

351
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:26,068
He came by and asked me
about the car the other day.

352
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:29,661
I said I didn't have it, and he left.

353
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:34,546
- Did you tell him I had it?
- I told him it had been stolen.

354
00:45:34,671 --> 00:45:39,904
Good, because I've never
seen this guy before.

355
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:11,341
Hi.

356
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:17,148
- Feeling your mortality?
- Something like that.

357
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:21,469
- You didn't come yesterday.
- Yesterday, I was brave.

358
00:46:21,591 --> 00:46:24,867
But not today.

359
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:44,945
Hi, it's me.
I guess you've gone to bed.

360
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:51,510
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>
<i>I'm not coming out tonight, so...</i>

361
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,950
Good night.

362
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:09,223
How many people here know
that it's your birthday today?

363
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:14,583
- We shouldn't have moved, I guess.
- I don't want to be here.

364
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:18,908
Things will get better, I promise.

365
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:23,706
You didn't like the last place
either, but that changed.

366
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:29,860
Hang on, honey. I have an extra
birthday present for you.

367
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,300
Thank you.

368
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,467
Easy on the calls, okay?

369
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,468
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

370
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:18,063
- A night at the office.
- My car's on the blink.

371
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:23,105
- Who's stuff is this?
- It's from Anja's room.

372
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,381
Carl Svendsen's dead daughter.

373
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:31,584
I'd like to see what's on her
computer, can you help me out?

374
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:38,183
It might take a while. You know, TJA
must be an abbreviation or something.

375
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:45,739
Look at her income. How can
a 14-year-old make money like that?

376
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:50,227
Robert Folkesson
doesn't seem too popular.

377
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:55,299
No, not all teachers are popular.

378
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:22,502
- Where's the teachers' lounge?
- It's one floor up.

379
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,827
<i>She cut classes</i>
<i>and caused trouble.</i>

380
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:33,785
Cheeky and hostile.
She'd walk out if she felt like it,

381
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,947
so we had quite a few run-ins.

382
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,699
Why did she cross out your face?

383
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:46,826
Some kids can't stand anyone placing
the slightest demands on them.

384
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:51,148
They view school
as some kind of recreation centre.

385
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:54,706
Do you mean Anja?

386
00:49:54,830 --> 00:50:00,302
It was a tragedy,
but you did ask for my opinion.

387
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,979
I remember her as being a handful.

388
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:08,820
Why don't you talk to Lennart
Frisk, the school counsellor.

389
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,829
He saw a lot of her.

390
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,740
Thanks. Is his office that way?

391
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:25,102
- What kind of car do you have?
- A Mazda pick-up. Why?

392
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:29,906
- Not exactly a family car.
- I don't have a family.

393
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:37,300
I haul lumber in it.
I remodel houses in my spare time.

394
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,979
Where were you last Wednesday night?

395
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:45,023
I was in London,
with our ninth-graders.

396
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:50,463
We came back Thursday morning.

397
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,104
Thank you.

398
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:18,587
- How's it going?
- There are 57 vehicles.

399
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:25,422
- How many companies are left?
- 10 tyre companies.

400
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:33,104
- Hi. Where's Linda?
- I don't know.

401
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,463
- I though you stuck together.
- I haven't seen her since yesterday.

402
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:43,710
- Didn't she sleep at home?
- No.

403
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:47,823
And you aren't curious about
where she spent the night?

404
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:52,546
- Why should I be?
- If someone I lived with didn't...

405
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:58,427
Linda and I work together,
we're not a couple.

406
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,781
You are aware
that it wouldn't be appropriate?

407
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:06,426
When you work together, I mean.

408
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:10,099
Hello...

409
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,225
Swim gear, mobile phone...

410
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,899
I can't figure
this Carl Svendsen fellow out.

411
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,659
He moved here from Copenhagen
five years ago.

412
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:53,263
He doesn't socialize, he starts
a business with Ralf Sahlin.

413
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:58,225
His daughter commits suicide
and he disappears.

414
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:03,424
There must be something in his past
we don't know about.

415
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,702
Maybe it's time
for a trip to Copenhagen?

416
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:11,459
Let's take a deep breath first.

417
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:19,221
- I haven't heard that before.
- I'm not in such great shape.

418
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:23,184
I've heard the rumours
about your health.

419
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:29,340
- I see. How sick am I?
- Terminal cancer. Raging.

420
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:37,707
- You don't sound sympathetic.
- Ann-Britt brought me up to speed.

421
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:42,665
- Does Linda know?
- No.

422
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:46,703
I'll get the results in a few days.

423
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,664
I can see that you're worried.

424
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:58,378
But no matter what the test says,
you'll live to a ripe old age.

425
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:02,628
- Why is that?
- You take good care of yourself.

426
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:09,019
In the old days, before that heart
attack, I was really worried.

427
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,064
Anyway, look at this.

428
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:20,028
- What's that?
- The computer Linda brought in.

429
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:23,187
It belonged
to Carl Svendsen's daughter.

430
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:27,019
Here's a print from this surface,

431
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,426
and this one's
from Carl Svendsen's car.

432
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:36,500
It's not uncommon that parents
use their children's computers.

433
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:45,108
- Is this hers too?
- Along with the box and the money.

434
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:48,540
Quite a lot for a 14-year-old.

435
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:54,787
Stefan Lindman from the Ystad
police department calling.

436
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:59,062
Do you own a van with
the license plate number TJA 752?

437
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:04,548
Do you still live in Trollhättan?
Were you in Skåne last week?

438
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:08,219
Thank you for helping me out.

439
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,781
Is the license plate number TJA 481?

440
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:20,428
Does your husband own a van with
the license plate number TJA 352?

441
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,225
All right. Thank you very much.

442
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,989
I'm calling from the police...

443
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:34,425
Do you own a van with
the license plate number TJA 422?

444
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:38,020
Do you still live in Södertälje?

445
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:11,865
"Pyrrhus." "Another such victory,
and I am undone," right?

446
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:15,903
Maybe Anja was
into the ancient Greeks.

447
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:19,659
Oh, it's a horse...

448
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:26,901
This is every last tyre company
all the way to Jönköping.

449
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:32,821
- Let's try this onev TJA 436.
- Nope.

450
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:36,704
Okay. TJA 751.

451
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:45,266
- You wanted to discuss Tove Sahlin?
- No, Anja Svendsen.

452
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:49,019
- Anja Svendsen?
- She came to see you, didn't she?

453
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,948
Yes, many times.

454
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:57,098
Unfortunately, she committed
suicide. What a tragedy.

455
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,222
- Do you know why she did it?
- No.

456
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:05,185
She had the same problems
many girls her age have.

457
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:11,146
She was sick of school, worried
about her appearance... You know.

458
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:15,309
Sometimes we just can't help them.

459
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:19,309
They get sucked down
into a dark void.

460
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,059
It's just as disturbing
every time it happens.

461
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,944
- Was she into drugs?
- Not that I was aware of.

462
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:31,507
- Why are you asking about Anja?
- Her father has disappeared.

463
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:35,145
I'm trying to create
a picture of his life.

464
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:40,219
- And you haven't found him?
- No.

465
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:44,184
- Did you ever meet him?
- No. Not her mother, either.

466
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:50,180
I tried to get them involved,
but they didn't seem interested.

467
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:55,589
Many parents don't wake up
until it's too late.

468
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:03,139
- I'm sorry, I have an appointment.
- I can come back.

469
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:06,580
- What kind of car do you have?
- I don't have one.

470
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:10,066
- Do you have access to a car?
- No. Yes...

471
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:14,308
- We can borrow the school's mini-bus.
- Like book it?

472
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:20,346
- Sign up for it?
- No, if it's free you can use it.

473
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:24,429
One last question,
were you in London, too?

474
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:28,589
- Yes.
- Thank you.

475
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:38,149
Can you imagine how she felt?

476
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:42,058
It's understandable that she did
what she did.

477
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:47,059
It wasn't a cry for help,
she wanted to die.

478
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,658
Hello, Linda. It's me.

479
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,858
Going home, Sara?

480
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:18,029
Jump in and I'll take you.
I'm going in that direction anyways.

481
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:46,584
- What's the address?
- Styrmansvägen.

482
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:51,500
You'll have to show me,
I'm not sure where it is.

483
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:57,307
- That's a nice phone.
- It's a birthday present.

484
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:04,780
Is it your birthday? Well, what do
you know? How old are you, 21?

485
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:11,179
- 14.
- I've got a present for you.

486
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:15,303
Come on, it's your birthday!

487
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:20,299
Vitamin C, it's good for you.
Happy birthday!

488
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:25,709
You know, you're supposed
to drink two litres of fluids a day.

489
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:30,142
It helps cleanse the body,
or something.

490
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,465
Like it?

491
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:40,543
Drink it up, then, or you'll
hurt my feelings. Bottoms up.

492
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:49,826
I wonder if more girls were involved?

493
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:55,104
In that case, we'd better
look into other teen suicides.

494
01:00:55,230 --> 01:01:00,543
Carl Svendsen broke
into Anja's box. - Let me finish.

495
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:04,743
He figured things out
and wanted revenge.

496
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:12,220
We might have something. We
requested a list of Svendsen's calls.

497
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:17,549
The night he went missing, Carl's
dad had left his mobile behind.

498
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,219
And someone used it to call
the Dept. of Motor Vehicles

499
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:25,866
and ask questions about
license plates beginning with TJA.

500
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:29,665
So we checked the tyre lists...

501
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:35,979
A car here in Ystad, TJA 481, had
new tyres put on 6 months ago.

502
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:41,104
Goodyear Cargo, the same type
that made the tracks by the glasses.

503
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:45,462
The owner is Jens Olsson.

504
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:51,062
A small-time crook,
drugs and assault.

505
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:54,899
- Where is he?
- Generally nearby the school.

506
01:01:55,030 --> 01:02:00,423
But he rents a room at a farm not far
from where we found Svendsen's car.

507
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,862
No one's seen him today.

508
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:29,589
Who cares? He's not really
the one we're after, is he?

509
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:33,589
Isn't the standard scenario
a bunch of perverts

510
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:37,589
who start a club and prey on kids?

511
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:41,749
So why should we waste our time
on a lousy small-time dealer?

512
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:49,220
A creep that might have slipped
a few girls some Rohypnol or GHB.

513
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:55,585
We only have one bloody lead.
Let's start there, okay?

514
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:38,264
Hey, the door is open.
What do you say, shall we go in?

515
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:27,028
Look, hundreds of prescriptions.
Rohypnol, Rohypnol, Rohypnol...

516
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:36,304
He was here just a moment ago.

517
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:49,984
Kurt here.
The dogs, are they still in training?

518
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:56,460
Where are my clothes?
What the hell have you done?!

519
01:06:56,590 --> 01:07:00,902
- My dad's going to kill you!
- I doubt it.

520
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:09,025
That's you, Sara. You wouldn't want
anyone to see these, would you?

521
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:15,225
There are people who pay well
to spend an hour with a pretty girl.

522
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:08,980
Stop! I told you to stop!

523
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:30,019
- When is the next bus due?
- In a few minutes.

524
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,099
That's him!

525
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:47,383
Stop!

526
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:59,701
What did those girls ever do to you,
you disgusting piece of shit!

527
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:14,307
I heard you were looking for a van.

528
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:19,788
We just came from a traffic accident
over by Svartö, a girl was run over.

529
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:23,061
Apparently, she jumped out of a van

530
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:27,468
and ran into the street. The van
was gone when we got there.

531
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:32,380
- Anyone see the license number?
- No, but it might be our van.

532
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:36,105
- Who's the girl?
- Sara Bruck, 1 4 years old.

533
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,506
- How's she doing?
- They took her to the hospital.

534
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:45,387
<i>Calling 29-10, calling 29-10.</i>
<i>This is the Canine Unit.</i>

535
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:50,538
<i>We're by the church. A van heading</i>
<i>for Ingelstorp just passed us.</i>

536
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:54,504
I read you, we're on our way. Over.

537
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:59,226
- Shall we go?
- I want to go to the hospital.

538
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:04,583
- I'll call in for a car.
- I'll take the bus.

539
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:15,626
Is the bus due anytime soon?

540
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:44,746
Stop!

541
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:07,548
What's the matter?

542
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:11,709
Shit, I drank that water.

543
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:22,067
- You don't drive?
- My license was revoked last year.

544
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:29,062
- Why did you lend Sonny your car?
- I wanted to do him a favour.

545
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,909
You were carrying 400 pills,

546
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:35,705
and you expect me to believe
you're a law-abiding citizen?

547
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:40,745
- And you wouldn't dream of driving?
- No.

548
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:47,503
Did you give him the junk
to dope up the girls he raped?

549
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:53,944
- Or did you fuck them?
- He might have stolen them from me.

550
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:58,222
And here you were such a nice guy
and lent him your car and all!

551
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:04,220
- You sell drugs at school.
- Who told you that?

552
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:09,219
Sonny's in the next room.
We know what he's been up to.

553
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:12,547
I don't give a damn
about the Rohypnol.

554
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:17,505
I'm going to nail you for rape,
abduction and murder.

555
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:22,909
Quit trying to jerk me around
and answer my questions, scumbag!

556
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:28,787
- Have you seen this man?
- He's gone missing.

557
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:34,064
He asked me about the car
last Wednesday. A scary guy.

558
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:37,819
I told him that Sonny had it,
and he took off.

559
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:42,899
- Without a word?
- He was packing a shotgun.

560
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:49,185
He told me he'd come back and shoot
my balls off if I had lied to him.

561
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:13,547
Hello. You're Sara's dad, aren't you?

562
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:18,949
- I'm Detective Linda Wallander.
- Martin Bruck.

563
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:22,904
Why don't we sit down?

564
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:36,059
- How is she?
- They say she'll be fine, but...

565
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,943
I'm with the ClD.

566
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:44,827
We've taken charge here due
to a range of odd circumstances.

567
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:50,263
Why was Sara in that area? Does she
know anyone who lives there?

568
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:56,625
No, and I'd know that.
We're new in town.

569
01:14:56,750 --> 01:15:00,459
You do know that she
had Rohypnol in her bloodstream?

570
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:06,904
- Where did it come from?
- How the hell should I know?

571
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:16,426
We found your prints
on Svendsen's car,

572
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:22,261
but you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

573
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:26,429
Well, then I'll tell you what happened.

574
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:31,704
He turned that shotgun on you because
you had ruined his daughter's life.

575
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:38,349
So you killed him. You saw
the little boy and you panicked.

576
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:46,900
You took Svendsen's body over to the
farm and left the car at the bus stop.

577
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:53,469
I have no idea what you're talking
about. I haven't done anything.

578
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:58,266
A while back this young fellow
was sitting that very same chair.

579
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:02,702
He had seen the lists of
the people who had died in the tsunami.

580
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:09,099
He picked out one of the families
most affected by the tragedy.

581
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:12,984
He broke into their home
and stole all their valuables.

582
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:16,500
But guess what he did before he left?

583
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:21,943
He turned on
every single faucet full blast.

584
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:26,427
When he was here
I remember thinking

585
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:32,307
that he was the most despicable
and pathetic person I'd ever met.

586
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:35,388
Only now I know better.

587
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:57,665
Where did you used to live?

588
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:03,308
We've moved a lot. You have
to go where the jobs are.

589
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:07,582
Most recently,
we lived in Lund for a year.

590
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:15,549
Sara made friends and started
hoping she would be able to stay.

591
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:22,746
She used the word "home"
for the first time. "At home, in Lund".

592
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:29,946
That's why it was so much harder
to have to move.

593
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:37,465
Everything went wrong here.
She didn't want to go to school...

594
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:41,629
The other kids bullied her.
She was in lots of fights.

595
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:49,703
Her form master is always calling.
Now the counsellor is involved.

596
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:55,029
Her form master,
would that be Robert Folkesson?

597
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:00,745
Listen, I'll be right back.

598
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:11,149
Listen, Dad: Anja, Tove and Sara
had one thing in common.

599
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:16,987
I've talked to the DA
and we both take the same line:

600
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:20,261
You are under arrest
for the murder of Carl Svendsen.

601
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:25,589
It doesn't bother me that you haven't
talked - other people have.

602
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:36,829
What did he say?
What the hell did he say?

603
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:39,100
Who?

604
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:20,069
Tove?

605
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:22,624
Tove!

606
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:40,868
- Has she been moved?
- No.

607
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:44,062
She's not here.

608
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:48,462
We have a missing patient.

609
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:53,664
What? On the roof? How...?

610
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:59,262
I know, Tove. This is the hardest
thing you've ever done.

611
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:02,223
But you're doing it for us.

612
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:06,866
I want to help you be just as
courageous as I know you are.

613
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:16,627
Think of the times I've encouraged
you to take that leap of faith.

614
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:25,619
If you're worried about the pain,
you won't feel a thing, I promise.

615
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:29,459
Because when you fall,
everything shuts down.

616
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:33,868
That's how we were designed,
Tove dear.

617
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:40,543
It's only the moment beforehand
that is a bit unpleasant.

618
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:47,863
You've got to be brave.

619
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,381
Let her go!

620
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:13,788
It was you. You picked them out.

621
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:20,827
It wasn't for the money, was it?
You fucked them, you bastard!

622
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:27,583
Then Anja died. And you had to find
a new girl. New girls all the time...

623
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:32,022
Damn you! Damn you!

624
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:36,701
Do you know what you are?

625
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:41,108
Yes, I do.

626
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:52,062
No!

627
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:02,343
Oh, shit!

628
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:30,382
- Hello, wasn't it cold out there?
- Yes.

629
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:36,346
But this is something
I've been dying to do all winter.

630
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:42,989
- Did it fulfil your expectations?
- Sailing clears your mind.

631
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:47,228
It blows all those stale thoughts
away. I really needed that.

632
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:51,423
Yes, this was revolting.

633
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:56,465
We're going through
the counsellor's belongings.

634
01:22:56,590 --> 01:23:02,506
- Have you seen the girls?
- Sara. She's upset.

635
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:08,580
And she's moving back to Lund,
so I guess she'll be okay.

636
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:14,899
Tove, on the other hand.
I don't know...

637
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:18,943
I know this was hard on you.

638
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:25,782
But your dedication
helped us crack the case.

639
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:32,703
This was painful. Really painful.

640
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:37,665
The first time
I went into Anja's room,

641
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:42,386
it was like someone
had hit me over the head.

642
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:48,142
I felt myself getting sucked in,
right back to that awful time.

643
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:54,266
When I realised how utterly
worthless I am,

644
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:59,145
and how much better off
everyone would be without me.

645
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:08,063
I cut myself, my arms.

646
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:11,307
But I managed to pull through it all.

647
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:16,458
The school nurse
caught sight of my arms.

648
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:25,503
Then suddenly, there he was.
And he listened to me.

649
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:31,580
I put my faith in him. I trusted him.

650
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:38,661
He got me out of that cesspool,
gave me the opportunity to grow up.

651
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:42,942
He was the school counsellor.

652
01:24:53,870 --> 01:25:00,264
By the way, I went to the flat
to pick up some stuff. This is for you.

653
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:31,259
Did you have this with you
during all those hours at sea?

654
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:41,548
- Looks like a good letter.
- Yes.

655
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:45,299
It's a very good letter.
