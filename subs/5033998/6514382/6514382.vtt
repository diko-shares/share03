1
00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.009
Heh, heh.
I think women can do anything.

2
00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:59.560
Well, I mean, just because they can,
doesn't mean they should, right?

3
00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:04.431
Think about women fixing cars,

4
00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:06.437
driving a taxi,

5
00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:08.644
installing some drywall.

6
00:01:08.737 --> 00:01:10.820
- Why not?
- No.

7
00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:12.192
Look, trust me.

8
00:01:12.283 --> 00:01:14.946
A girl like you, you don't really want this.

9
00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:16.867
- A girl like me?
- Mm-hm.

10
00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:21.615
I want all my options available
so I can decide for myself.

11
00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:24.413
Ahh. Miss Independent.

12
00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:27.288
Ha-ha-ha. That's right.

13
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:29.714
- That's me.
- I love it.

14
00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:31.342
Mm.

15
00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:34.506
- Come here.
- Mm.

16
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:40.888
Oh. Mm...

17
00:01:41.478 --> 00:01:42.514
Except...

18
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.347
you're sitting here, eating my food,

19
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.398
enjoying my view.

20
00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:48.565
By choice.

21
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.936
I chose you to join me.

22
00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:55.649
- I chose to make you notice me.
- Ah. Mm-mm.

23
00:01:55.784 --> 00:01:58.071
That is not your choice, Sabina.

24
00:01:58.162 --> 00:01:59.698
That is God's gift to you.

25
00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:03.625
Gosh.

26
00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:09.497
But don't you think it's sort of what you do
with those gifts that really matters?

27
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:12.499
- Mm.
- Every one of us.

28
00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:14.425
Men, women.

29
00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:18.927
We all just wanna fulfill our potential,
live our heart's desires.

30
00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.973
That's the world I wanna live in.

31
00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:22.638
Ahh.

32
00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:26.805
Well, my world is me making millions

33
00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.438
- with you by my side.
- Heh, heh.

34
00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:35.693
It's just that I'm so good
at so many things.

35
00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:37.524
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:38.618
Like what?

37
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:40.411
Well,

38
00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:42.241
at myjob,

39
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.998
it's considered a huge advantage
to be a woman.

40
00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:47.085
Hm.

41
00:02:48.253 --> 00:02:52.167
Yeah, if you're beautiful,
nothing else is really expected of you.

42
00:02:52.257 --> 00:02:53.589
And if you're not,

43
00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:55.918
you're pretty much rendered invisible.

44
00:02:57.346 --> 00:02:58.712
And in my line of work,

45
00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:03.217
invisibility, low expectations...

46
00:03:04.311 --> 00:03:06.223
they come in very handy.

47
00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:09.310
Housewife, sounds like.

48
00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.442
Nothing wrong with being a housewife.

49
00:03:13.821 --> 00:03:15.813
Just not my choice.

50
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.199
- I don't speak Portuguese.
- I know.

51
00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:26.410
Yeah, that's it.

52
00:03:45.102 --> 00:03:47.139
- Did you know...
- What?

53
00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:50.221
that it takes men
an additional seven seconds

54
00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:52.648
to perceive a woman
as a threat compared to a man?

55
00:03:54.528 --> 00:03:55.609
Isn't that wild?

56
00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:01.240
- Who are you?
- Who, me?

57
00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:05.953
I'm just the decoy, stud.

58
00:04:14.506 --> 00:04:16.213
- How many?
- Nine!

59
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.541
Send the lot.

60
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.594
You stole aid money from women
and children and refugees!

61
00:04:28.687 --> 00:04:29.928
It's called embezzlement!

62
00:04:31.982 --> 00:04:34.190
"Embezzlement"? That's fancy.

63
00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:45.034
- You must be the accountant.
- Who are you?

64
00:04:46.538 --> 00:04:47.538
Open the safe.

65
00:04:47.623 --> 00:04:50.787
Oh, baby, baby, you swiped right!

66
00:04:50.876 --> 00:04:52.617
I'm your girlfriend now!

67
00:04:54.463 --> 00:04:56.796
Everything on the bottom row. Let's go.

68
00:04:58.675 --> 00:05:02.214
You're not cut out for this.
I recommend a new line of work.

69
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.932
Bosley!

70
00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:09.259
Evening, Angels.

71
00:05:10.312 --> 00:05:13.601
Well, all this looks very promising.

72
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.147
Outstanding.

73
00:05:15.526 --> 00:05:17.984
But what about Australian Jonny?

74
00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:21.654
- Ta-da. Yeah.
- Oh, you're gonna regret this.

75
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.983
- I was gonna give you the world.
- The thing is, is you talk way too much.

76
00:05:25.077 --> 00:05:27.410
You're super clingy,
and you come on way too strong.

77
00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:29.557
You are the most incredible woman
that I've ever met.

78
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:30.581
I know.

79
00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:33.624
So that's four months' surveillance,
two countries

80
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.498
and the most embarrassing date
I have ever been on in my life.

81
00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:37.958
Are we good?

82
00:05:38.048 --> 00:05:41.166
I will address this
to the U.S. Justice Department,

83
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.503
along with all your new friends here.

84
00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:46.883
- We're good to go.
- Sweet.

85
00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:48.055
I'm out of here, man.

86
00:05:48.142 --> 00:05:51.351
I'm gonna take a week off,
party my ass off on a Thai beach.

87
00:05:51.436 --> 00:05:54.895
Jane, you should give it a shot:
beaches, letting someone play with your:

88
00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:58.023
I have fun in my own ways.

89
00:05:58.777 --> 00:06:00.439
Ah. Cool.

90
00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.316
You sharpen your samurai swords at night?

91
00:06:03.615 --> 00:06:05.106
Cosplay Catwoman?

92
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.907
I'd actually pay to see that.

93
00:06:06.994 --> 00:06:09.907
Occasionally you eat gluten at night
and feel a little... Ah!

94
00:06:10.497 --> 00:06:11.863
That was fun.

95
00:06:11.957 --> 00:06:13.539
So who were they?

96
00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:17.084
You were in the presence of Angels.

97
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.247
But the question is, Jonny,

98
00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:23.667
who are you?

118
00:07:20.692 --> 00:07:21.692
Hey, Ingrid.

119
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:26.355
- You are late. Mr. Fleming is waiting.
- Wasn't the meeting set for 9?

120
00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:29.236
Yes, 9 a.m. is when the meeting starts,

121
00:07:29.326 --> 00:07:31.818
- which is exactly now.
- Oh.

122
00:07:31.912 --> 00:07:34.279
Have you ever spent time with him? Mr. Brok?

123
00:07:34.373 --> 00:07:35.534
No, of course not.

124
00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:37.786
He had me over to his château,
which is in France.

125
00:07:38.543 --> 00:07:41.502
And we were sitting there,
and I'm asking him,

126
00:07:41.588 --> 00:07:45.923
I said, "Mr. Brok,
have you ever heard of Humphry Davy?"

127
00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:47.466
And he says, "No."

128
00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:52.843
I say, "Have you ever heard of Joseph Swan
or Alexander Lodygin?" "No clue."

129
00:07:53.308 --> 00:07:54.890
So I say, "Okay.

130
00:07:54.977 --> 00:07:57.185
What about Thomas Edison?"

131
00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:00.355
"Well, of course. Who hasn't?
He invented the light bulb."

132
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.477
Right? But guess what?

133
00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:04.354
So did those other three guys.

134
00:08:04.444 --> 00:08:05.855
Before Edison.

135
00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:08.689
But Edison was first to market.

136
00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:11.065
Do you see my point?

137
00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:15.779
We have a product that will
revolutionize the power industry.

138
00:08:15.872 --> 00:08:17.488
But we have to be first.

139
00:08:17.582 --> 00:08:19.244
The time is now.

140
00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:23.203
And that's what I told Mr. Brok,
and he agrees with me.

141
00:08:23.297 --> 00:08:24.297
Obviously.

142
00:08:25.007 --> 00:08:27.340
- I...
- Elena, thank you so much for coming in.

143
00:08:27.426 --> 00:08:30.794
- I love how this conversation went.
- Technically, I haven't said anything yet.

144
00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:32.824
Let's not get caught in a game
of who said what, right?

145
00:08:32.848 --> 00:08:35.591
Mr. Fleming,
I know how important Calisto is, okay?

146
00:08:35.684 --> 00:08:37.892
I'm the lead programmer on it. It's my baby.

147
00:08:37.978 --> 00:08:39.458
- Yeah.
- But as I wrote in my report,

148
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:43.390
right now there is a possibility
for the harmonic range to be reversed,

149
00:08:43.483 --> 00:08:45.440
and we both know
how dangerous that could be.

150
00:08:45.527 --> 00:08:47.644
Well, you don't know what I know.

151
00:08:48.363 --> 00:08:50.525
You know Julio? The second engineer?

152
00:08:50.615 --> 00:08:53.904
He's actually still in hospital
after a brain seizure,

153
00:08:53.994 --> 00:08:57.533
- and he was partially exposed during a test.
- Allegedly. Allegedly.

154
00:08:57.622 --> 00:09:00.205
And Julio was an idiot.

155
00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:04.662
All I need is root access and some time to
permanently fix the flaw in the blockchain

156
00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:06.496
so that it will stay safe...

157
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.673
Ingrid, can I get a cappuccino?

158
00:09:09.593 --> 00:09:11.585
Okay. I read your report.

159
00:09:12.137 --> 00:09:14.595
I've had others read your report.

160
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.597
We just simply disagree with you.

161
00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:19.475
Has Mr. Brok read my report?

162
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:22.725
- I think that if he read...
- Let me be crystal clear.

163
00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:27.768
We have developed Calisto for five years,
and we are going to market.

164
00:09:27.861 --> 00:09:32.151
It is safe and it is ready,
and that's what we're telling Mr. Brok.

165
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.654
And you are telling Mr. Brok nothing.

166
00:09:38.622 --> 00:09:43.458
Look, Elena, you're much too smart
to keep pushing this forward, aren't you?

167
00:09:48.298 --> 00:09:49.298
Good.

168
00:09:56.932 --> 00:09:59.720
- I knew who Humphry Davy was.
- Good for you.

169
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:08.604
- You dropped something.
- Oh, no. That's not mine.

170
00:10:08.693 --> 00:10:11.731
Well, I don't litter, so it must be yours.

171
00:10:13.573 --> 00:10:14.905
You might need it.

172
00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:46.095
Bosley, 001.

173
00:11:00.328 --> 00:11:01.864
You old codger.

174
00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:05.198
You really thought
we were gonna let you sneak away quietly?

175
00:11:06.126 --> 00:11:07.617
You didn't have to.

176
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:08.952
It's not just me.

177
00:11:10.338 --> 00:11:12.751
<i>Surprise!</i>

178
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:15.049
Surprise!

179
00:11:15.135 --> 00:11:17.127
Hey! Bonjour.

180
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:20.181
Gang's all here.

181
00:11:20.223 --> 00:11:23.136
We all wanted to wish you
a happy retirement.

182
00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:24.433
Thank you, Bosley.

183
00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:25.519
- And you, sir.
- Bosley.

184
00:11:25.604 --> 00:11:27.391
Bosley. Thank you.

185
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:29.222
- You.
- You've had one hell of a run.

186
00:11:29.316 --> 00:11:30.807
It deserves to be celebrated.

187
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:33.314
I even put together a little walk
down memory lane.

188
00:11:33.403 --> 00:11:34.985
- Shall we?
- Oh, no, no.

189
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:36.983
Here it comes.

190
00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:38.530
Oh, yeah!

191
00:11:39.618 --> 00:11:41.905
- Fresh-faced Oxford graduate.
- Yeah!

192
00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:43.702
- Oh, Lord.
- I dug deep for these.

193
00:11:43.788 --> 00:11:45.433
- Look at that.
- That's not a disguise.

194
00:11:45.457 --> 00:11:48.074
You clearly had a lot of fun over the years.

195
00:11:48.168 --> 00:11:50.251
Life was good in those days.

196
00:11:50.337 --> 00:11:53.375
- Where did you get that suit?
- Monte Carlo.

197
00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:55.798
It really happened. There's the proof.

198
00:11:57.302 --> 00:11:59.840
Well, when you opened the European offices,

199
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.217
you took the Townsend Agency international.

200
00:12:02.307 --> 00:12:05.220
- None of us would be here without you.
- Yes.

201
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.222
Especially me. Thank you.

202
00:12:07.312 --> 00:12:09.850
Well, I'm very touched.

203
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.351
Thank you. All of you.

204
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.558
<i>- Say a few words. Come on, speech, Bosley.
- Speech!</i>

205
00:12:13.652 --> 00:12:15.985
- Oh, no.
<i>- Speech, speech, speech!</i>

206
00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:18.404
<i>Speech, speech, speech!</i>

207
00:12:21.284 --> 00:12:23.446
Well, frankly, I am overwhelmed.

208
00:12:26.289 --> 00:12:27.496
I'm grateful...

209
00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:31.538
for all the work that we have done together.

210
00:12:32.379 --> 00:12:34.996
And, you know, Charlie wasn't sure

211
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:39.209
that we could replicate the success
that he had here in California.

212
00:12:39.302 --> 00:12:41.259
- But we made it work...
- That's right.

213
00:12:41.346 --> 00:12:46.057
in a world that was really not ready
for the Angels.

214
00:12:46.518 --> 00:12:48.350
For 40 years,

215
00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:50.598
I recruited them, I trained them...

216
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.477
and I'm so very proud of them.

217
00:12:54.943 --> 00:12:56.059
Bosleys...

218
00:12:56.611 --> 00:12:58.773
- you keep them safe.
- Will do.

219
00:12:58.863 --> 00:13:01.025
- Hear, hear.
<i>- We will, my friend.</i>

220
00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:04.359
And so for me, as Charlie said,

221
00:13:04.452 --> 00:13:08.492
- time to make an exit stage left.
- Ah. Speaking of Charlie...

222
00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:11.915
<i>Hello, Bosley.</i>

223
00:13:12.002 --> 00:13:13.493
Hello, Charlie.

224
00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:16.000
<i>If you look around this room, old friend,</i>

225
00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:20.299
<i>you'll see the men and women
who will carry your legacy into the future.</i>

226
00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:24.095
<i>Your leadership
and commitment is unparalleled.</i>

227
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.923
<i>We owe you a debt we cannot repay.</i>

228
00:13:27.017 --> 00:13:30.010
<i>So instead, we got you a watch.</i>

229
00:13:30.562 --> 00:13:32.770
- A watch?
- Yes.

230
00:13:33.857 --> 00:13:36.144
- Ohh.
- Thank you, Charlie.

231
00:13:36.234 --> 00:13:38.567
<i>Enjoy your retirement.</i>

232
00:13:38.653 --> 00:13:40.235
<i>You deserve it.</i>

233
00:13:40.322 --> 00:13:41.904
A toast!

234
00:13:42.616 --> 00:13:45.609
- You really like to party.
- It's the day drinking.

235
00:13:45.702 --> 00:13:47.785
- Cheers.
- That's what I like the most.

236
00:13:47.871 --> 00:13:49.032
You're not bad either.

237
00:13:49.122 --> 00:13:50.329
<i>To Bosley.</i>

238
00:13:50.874 --> 00:13:53.082
- To Bosley!

Everyone, please help me welcome

our founder,

251
00:14:27.327 --> 00:14:28.693
our benefactor,

252
00:14:28.787 --> 00:14:30.494
Alexander Brok.

253
00:14:34.209 --> 00:14:39.329
Mr. Brok, you have set
the highest standards for innovation.

254
00:14:39.422 --> 00:14:44.383
I believe that I, along with a little help
from my team, have met that challenge.

255
00:14:45.261 --> 00:14:48.675
Today,
I instructed the Hamburg power utility

256
00:14:49.265 --> 00:14:52.804
to disconnect this building
from the electrical grid.

257
00:14:53.311 --> 00:14:56.520
But we are far from powerless.

258
00:14:59.234 --> 00:15:00.234
Mr. Brok,

259
00:15:00.902 --> 00:15:02.859
would you grant us root access?

260
00:15:04.364 --> 00:15:06.321
<i>Hello, Alexander.</i>

261
00:15:06.408 --> 00:15:08.115
<i>Root access granted.</i>

262
00:15:08.201 --> 00:15:10.944
Calisto, turn on the lights.

263
00:15:12.872 --> 00:15:15.410
Calisto, pair with sister devices.

264
00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:19.459
Calisto, full power.

265
00:15:27.846 --> 00:15:30.088
<i>Brok Industries can power the world.</i>

266
00:15:36.813 --> 00:15:39.772
So you went with rare-earth magnetics
in the end?

267
00:15:39.858 --> 00:15:41.099
Ah, yes.

268
00:15:41.192 --> 00:15:43.309
Inside a cyanide crystal matrix.

269
00:15:44.738 --> 00:15:46.378
- It's kyanite, but...
- Kyanite.

270
00:15:48.074 --> 00:15:49.815
- May I?
- Please.

271
00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:51.901
You delivered
on the safety protocols, right?

272
00:15:51.995 --> 00:15:56.160
Oh, absolutely. Calisto only talks
with electrical circuitry.

273
00:15:56.249 --> 00:15:59.242
The current never touches people,
pets, plants.

274
00:15:59.335 --> 00:16:01.327
It's smart and it's safe.

275
00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:06.086
Although, in the spirit of full disclosure,
I should mention one small thing.

276
00:16:06.968 --> 00:16:10.712
It can be manufactured
in pastel colors for the ladies.

277
00:16:14.476 --> 00:16:15.717
You...

278
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:19.428
Well, this is it.

279
00:16:21.441 --> 00:16:24.184
We can bring clean energy to everyone.

280
00:16:24.903 --> 00:16:26.269
Sustainably.

281
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.237
Calisto is the future.

282
00:16:30.617 --> 00:16:33.826
And I am holding the future
in my hands, finally.

283
00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:36.328
Good work, guys.

284
00:16:37.791 --> 00:16:38.791
Good work.

285
00:16:39.584 --> 00:16:42.292
Come on, let's celebrate. Drinks in the bar!

286
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:47.247
Keep your form. Block.

287
00:16:48.384 --> 00:16:49.384
One, two.

<i>♪ Go, go getter ♪♪</i>

289
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:55.075
Let's take this one off.
Make it a bit tighter.

290
00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:56.099
Okay.

291
00:16:59.687 --> 00:17:00.687
Thanks.

292
00:17:00.939 --> 00:17:03.306
Paris is not so bad, right?

293
00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:05.891
Did you take the apartment
with the good light?

294
00:17:05.985 --> 00:17:08.068
Yes, but if you get me a plant...

295
00:17:08.154 --> 00:17:09.215
I'm just gonna kill it.

296
00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:10.155
Of course.

297
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:13.402
I'm ready for a new assignment.

298
00:17:13.493 --> 00:17:16.827
Listen,
I've set a meeting with a new client.

299
00:17:16.913 --> 00:17:19.200
A corporate whistle-blower.

300
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.247
Putting a team together.

301
00:17:21.334 --> 00:17:22.916
- A team?
- Yes.

302
00:17:23.002 --> 00:17:24.743
Hey, Bosley.

303
00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:27.376
- You wanted to see me, right?
- Yes.

304
00:17:27.465 --> 00:17:28.465
Oh, hey.

305
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.260
You're the former MI6 ninja.

306
00:17:32.345 --> 00:17:33.345
Is it June?

307
00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:34.715
Oh, Jane.

308
00:17:34.806 --> 00:17:36.798
Oh, Jane. Jane. Not the month.

309
00:17:37.517 --> 00:17:38.517
Sabrina?

310
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:40.593
Sabina. It's Italian.

311
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.682
Oh, are you Italian?

312
00:17:43.106 --> 00:17:44.392
No. I... Maybe...

313
00:17:44.482 --> 00:17:47.145
We have a situation in Hamburg,
a new client.

314
00:17:47.235 --> 00:17:48.476
Hamburg.

315
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.903
Interestingly,
not where hamburgers were invented.

316
00:17:50.989 --> 00:17:54.198
That was in Frankfurt, where frankfurters
were not invented, which is...

317
00:17:54.284 --> 00:17:57.152
- Listen, I'm sorry. I'm vegetarian.
- I don't think that this is...

318
00:17:57.245 --> 00:17:58.452
Thank you very much.

319
00:17:58.538 --> 00:18:01.406
But I recall hearing
you two worked well together in Rio.

320
00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:03.916
I recall her pushing me off a roof.

321
00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:06.035
I recall it was time to go.

322
00:18:07.714 --> 00:18:08.750
That makes sense.

323
00:18:09.716 --> 00:18:10.716
Who's the client?

324
00:18:13.012 --> 00:18:14.012

- Elena?
- Hi.

332
00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:50.589
Welcome.

333
00:18:51.507 --> 00:18:52.467
Mr. Bosley?

334
00:18:52.468 --> 00:18:53.584
Just Bosley.

335
00:18:53.676 --> 00:18:55.292
Thank you for seeing me.

336
00:18:58.222 --> 00:19:00.885
- Would you like anything?
- Espresso, <i>bitte.</i>

337
00:19:04.979 --> 00:19:05.979
Espresso.

338
00:19:06.981 --> 00:19:09.644
- COS perimeter check.
- "COS"?

339
00:19:09.734 --> 00:19:12.647
I have less than no idea what that means,

340
00:19:12.737 --> 00:19:15.070
but you are good up here.

341
00:19:15.156 --> 00:19:16.692
I would say,

342
00:19:16.783 --> 00:19:18.524
the coast is clear.

343
00:19:18.618 --> 00:19:20.484
<i>Yes, exactly.</i>

344
00:19:20.578 --> 00:19:24.071
And I have thought about this a lot.
All we have to do is get it to Mr. Brok.

345
00:19:24.165 --> 00:19:26.122
<i>And I have tried to contact him.</i>

346
00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:29.034
Well, it takes a lot to come forward,

347
00:19:29.128 --> 00:19:31.120
and I appreciate your courage.

348
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.831
You sure you wanna take this risk?

349
00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:36.385
Yeah.

350
00:19:37.136 --> 00:19:39.128
Okay, we can help you.

351
00:19:39.222 --> 00:19:42.340
- It's just getting way out of hand.
- Stop it, you're so cute.

352
00:19:43.726 --> 00:19:44.933
I gotta get a dog.

353
00:19:46.062 --> 00:19:47.894
<i>I can't sleep at night,</i>

354
00:19:47.981 --> 00:19:51.600
<i>knowing and not being allowed to do
or say anything about it.</i>

355
00:19:54.404 --> 00:19:58.114
I can fix it,
but I just need the opportunity.

356
00:19:58.199 --> 00:20:01.363
I believe you.
Were you able to get the evidence?

357
00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:06.534
All my reports, all my data.

358
00:20:20.263 --> 00:20:21.595
What can I bring you?

359
00:20:34.277 --> 00:20:35.397
Your check, sir.

360
00:20:35.987 --> 00:20:37.228
Was that the signal?

361
00:20:37.989 --> 00:20:41.198
- Elena, you need to go to the ladies' room.
<i>- What's happening?</i>

362
00:20:41.284 --> 00:20:43.867
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Quickly.

363
00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:48.117
<i>Hey, what's happening? Jane?</i>

364
00:20:48.207 --> 00:20:49.167
Now!

365
00:20:51.377 --> 00:20:52.538
Hello... Oh, shit!

366
00:20:53.504 --> 00:20:54.504
Shit.

367
00:21:00.595 --> 00:21:02.632
Shit, shit, shit!

368
00:21:56.359 --> 00:21:57.566
That's my gun.

369
00:22:04.117 --> 00:22:06.029
Sabina! Hurry!

370
00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:07.119
- Go!
- Go!

371
00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:12.407
Yeah! Evac the client!
That's what I was gonna say!

372
00:22:12.792 --> 00:22:13.908
Whoa!

373
00:22:17.922 --> 00:22:18.958
What's going on?

374
00:22:19.048 --> 00:22:21.586
- Oh, God. You're not a waitress?
- No.

375
00:22:21.676 --> 00:22:24.043
I'm Jane. Nice to meet you.

376
00:22:24.554 --> 00:22:26.420
- Did you bring the big gun?
- In the back.

377
00:22:26.973 --> 00:22:29.135
- Can you move your feet?
- Oh, sure. Mm-hm.

378
00:22:30.017 --> 00:22:31.599
Oh, do you know how to use that?

379
00:22:38.609 --> 00:22:39.850
Mother@#*&er!

380
00:22:39.944 --> 00:22:42.436
Oh, my God! Is he shooting at us?!

381
00:22:46.701 --> 00:22:48.567
Hold on, ladies.

382
00:23:00.673 --> 00:23:03.507
Is that a tank? Oh, my God. Where'd he go?

383
00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:06.756
- I think we lost him!
- Bit much for just this girl, no?

384
00:23:06.846 --> 00:23:07.962
Who is this chick?

385
00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:09.055
Who am I?!

386
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.508
Who are you?! Who is he?
And why is he shooting at us?

387
00:23:12.602 --> 00:23:14.434
- Keep it steady.
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.

388
00:23:18.024 --> 00:23:19.140
Oh, no! He's back!

389
00:23:43.216 --> 00:23:44.297
Oh, my God!

390
00:23:49.347 --> 00:23:50.383
Oh, shit!

391
00:24:11.202 --> 00:24:12.488
Stay low. Stay low.

392
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.334
- Do a J-turn on my mark.
- Ready.

393
00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:21.626
Now!

394
00:24:38.562 --> 00:24:39.562
Bosley.

395
00:25:45.671 --> 00:25:46.671
Stay down!

396
00:25:49.592 --> 00:25:50.628
Jane!

397
00:25:52.762 --> 00:25:54.048
I said, stay down!

398
00:25:54.638 --> 00:25:56.755
Hey! Stop moving!

399
00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:36.971
Sandwich?

400
00:26:37.973 --> 00:26:39.509
It's tuna.

401
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.809
Unless it's cheese and it's not good.

402
00:26:50.569 --> 00:26:51.810
How about you? You hungry?

403
00:27:16.262 --> 00:27:17.878
Charlie sends love, Angels.

404
00:27:18.347 --> 00:27:20.134
Who is she? Who is she?

405
00:27:21.392 --> 00:27:24.100
Hey, she's in shock,
and she smells like puke.

406
00:27:24.186 --> 00:27:26.394
- Who are you?
- I'm Bosley.

407
00:27:26.981 --> 00:27:29.940
- Bosley?
- Bosley's a rank in our organization.

408
00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:32.688
It's like a lieutenant.

409
00:27:32.778 --> 00:27:35.521
The real name of the man you met
was Edgar Dessange.

410
00:27:37.324 --> 00:27:38.324
Edgar.

411
00:27:42.788 --> 00:27:45.576
Jane, I'm really sorry.

412
00:27:45.666 --> 00:27:48.124
- I know how much he meant to you.
- I don't need a hug.

413
00:27:50.754 --> 00:27:51.870
Well, I do.

414
00:27:52.882 --> 00:27:54.123
He was my friend too.

415
00:27:59.847 --> 00:28:01.054
Hugs work.

416
00:28:06.228 --> 00:28:08.515
Okay, let's get you cleaned up.

417
00:28:08.606 --> 00:28:10.063
Come on.

418
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:11.640
Is that a stolen car?

419
00:28:13.068 --> 00:28:14.068
Okay.

420
00:28:14.987 --> 00:28:17.946
Bosley, 342. Open Safe House 6.

421
00:28:24.788 --> 00:28:27.576
Boz, who else knew
we were meeting with Elena in Hamburg?

422
00:28:27.666 --> 00:28:30.204
Well, protocol would be not to tell anyone.

423
00:28:30.294 --> 00:28:32.001
Why do you ask?

424
00:28:32.087 --> 00:28:33.794
Well, Bosley...

425
00:28:33.881 --> 00:28:35.793
Edgar thought...

426
00:28:38.135 --> 00:28:39.967
Okay, you didn't see this guy.

427
00:28:40.054 --> 00:28:43.547
He was a pro, and he brought quite a lot
of firepower for such an easy target.

428
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:45.382
Yeah, he was so extra, right?

429
00:28:45.476 --> 00:28:47.638
I could take that girl out with,
like, a flyswatter.

430
00:28:47.728 --> 00:28:49.890
He rocks up in this urban assault vehicle.

431
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.597
So we're thinking what? He was...

432
00:28:52.691 --> 00:28:55.525
Maybe she was being watched...

433
00:28:55.611 --> 00:28:56.897
but what if we are?

434
00:28:56.987 --> 00:29:00.651
- And by who?
- Hey, you guys. All cleaned up.

435
00:29:00.741 --> 00:29:03.700
- Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

436
00:29:03.786 --> 00:29:06.153
I'm kind of getting this, you know.

437
00:29:06.247 --> 00:29:09.285
You guys are like lady spies and...

438
00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:13.039
I just need you to explain who this guy is
and why was he shooting at you.

439
00:29:13.128 --> 00:29:14.790
Oh, you.

440
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.543
- He was shooting at you.
- Jane.

441
00:29:19.093 --> 00:29:20.880
At me?

442
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.552
- Oh, God.
- Hey.

443
00:29:22.638 --> 00:29:24.675
- Okay.
- Just have some tea.

444
00:29:24.765 --> 00:29:25.805
The shooter's a ghost.

445
00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:29.092
Facial recognition's popped him
in a few different places over the years

446
00:29:29.186 --> 00:29:31.724
but no name, no record, nothing.

447
00:29:31.814 --> 00:29:34.648
- He's got friends in high places, then.
- I'm gonna kill him.

448
00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:38.609
I'm obliged to remind you,
Charlie frowns on revenge, Jane.

449
00:29:38.696 --> 00:29:40.858
So, Ms. Houghlin,

450
00:29:40.948 --> 00:29:45.568
your file says that you are
a systems engineer on the Calisto project.

451
00:29:45.661 --> 00:29:46.993
You know about Calisto?

452
00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:49.241
We know about a lot of things.

453
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:51.823
That you graduated top of your class at MIT,

454
00:29:51.917 --> 00:29:54.375
you take Krav Maga on Sundays,
you ride your bike to work.

455
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:57.704
You think yellow is one of your colors
when, in fact, it's no one's.

456
00:29:57.798 --> 00:30:00.277
That you could be dating a lot more
if you played up those cheekbones

457
00:30:00.301 --> 00:30:02.418
in your online profile pictures.

458
00:30:02.511 --> 00:30:06.425
What we don't know
is why someone wants you dead.

459
00:30:06.515 --> 00:30:08.285
ELENA
<i>I know it can be fixed.</i>

460
00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:11.052
<i>Let's take this one step at a time.</i>

461
00:30:11.145 --> 00:30:12.602
<i>There's a flaw in the system.</i>

462
00:30:13.647 --> 00:30:14.763
What's the flaw?

463
00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:17.891
Calisto can be weaponized.

464
00:30:18.902 --> 00:30:20.234
I mean, I can fix it.

465
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:23.155
But right now, any decent hacker,
curious or criminal enough,

466
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.983
could turn Calisto into an EMP
on the human body.

467
00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:28.321
An electromagnetic pulse.

468
00:30:28.412 --> 00:30:30.574
- Like a brain seizure, essentially.
- Yes.

469
00:30:30.664 --> 00:30:31.996
See? I know stuff.

470
00:30:32.082 --> 00:30:35.792
It disrupts the neural networks
and looks like a stroke or an aneurysm.

471
00:30:35.878 --> 00:30:38.245
So it can be used
without a trace of evidence.

472
00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:40.331
A perfect assassination machine.

473
00:30:40.424 --> 00:30:45.636
Yeah. And it can be triggered remotely
across the network that I created.

474
00:30:45.721 --> 00:30:48.714
Dope. See, now that is what you can do
if you pay attention in school.

475
00:30:48.807 --> 00:30:50.014
Who all knows about this?

476
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.811
I filed a report after it almost killed
my colleague during a security test,

477
00:30:54.897 --> 00:30:56.763
but I think it was buried.

478
00:30:56.857 --> 00:30:58.769
My report, not my colleague. No.

479
00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:00.600
Julio is fine. He...

480
00:31:00.694 --> 00:31:02.777
He just can't speak or see color anymore.

481
00:31:02.863 --> 00:31:04.354
It's not in production yet, is it?

482
00:31:04.448 --> 00:31:06.189
No, we're behind schedule,

483
00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:09.321
but there are six prototypes
in the Brok facility vault,

484
00:31:09.411 --> 00:31:12.279
plus the one at my lab
that I was using to program the fix, which...

485
00:31:12.373 --> 00:31:14.990
Let's get those prototypes out of there.

486
00:31:15.084 --> 00:31:17.667
I'm sorry.
Can we just hit pause for a second, please?

487
00:31:17.753 --> 00:31:21.713
Does your company have a website
with an employee directory with photos?

488
00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:24.337
Yes, but Brok Industries is equipped
with insane security.

489
00:31:24.426 --> 00:31:25.820
- There's no way...
- There we go.

490
00:31:25.844 --> 00:31:28.211
Do you think
she still has security clearance?

491
00:31:28.305 --> 00:31:31.548
If she doesn't, then we'll know the threat
comes from within, so either way...

492
00:31:31.642 --> 00:31:35.101
- Yeah, we get the information we need.
- No, no, no.

493
00:31:35.187 --> 00:31:36.974
No, no.

494
00:31:37.356 --> 00:31:38.597
- Ooh.
- No.

495
00:31:39.316 --> 00:31:41.524
- No, no, no.
- I...

496
00:31:41.652 --> 00:31:42.652
Hm.

497
00:31:43.278 --> 00:31:46.021
- Bowl cuts.
- Bowl cuts.

498
00:31:46.115 --> 00:31:47.115
Bowl cuts.

499
00:31:49.493 --> 00:31:50.700
Bowl cuts.

500
00:32:06.093 --> 00:32:07.709
Ah, ah, ah.

501
00:32:07.803 --> 00:32:09.510
Just trying to get to work, Ralph.

502
00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:12.346
Well, I gotta do myjob too.

503
00:32:13.684 --> 00:32:14.684
Okay.

504
00:32:17.354 --> 00:32:18.720
- New look, huh?
- Mm-hm.

505
00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:22.648
I like it a lot.

506
00:32:22.735 --> 00:32:24.476
Aren't you holding people up, Ralph?

507
00:32:25.404 --> 00:32:27.441
Well...

508
00:32:27.531 --> 00:32:29.363
you have yourself a good day.

509
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.692
And don't forget to smile, yeah?

510
00:33:04.318 --> 00:33:05.318
What?

511
00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:10.739
How...? How did you even get in the...?

512
00:33:10.824 --> 00:33:13.612
Oh, God. What did you do to Pradeep?

513
00:33:13.702 --> 00:33:15.034
Pradeep Prasad.

514
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.236
<i>Nothing.</i>

515
00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.411
<i>Pradeep's fine.</i>

516
00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:22.416
<i>I nabbed his ID card
from the gym this morning.</i>

517
00:33:23.378 --> 00:33:24.378
Hi.

518
00:33:25.214 --> 00:33:26.214
Bye.

519
00:33:27.174 --> 00:33:28.790
- Hi.
- Hi.

520
00:33:31.303 --> 00:33:32.544
And Sven?

521
00:33:33.222 --> 00:33:36.590
<i>I compressed his carotid
and deoxygenated his brain stem.</i>

522
00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:38.601
<i>What?</i>

523
00:33:38.894 --> 00:33:40.851
Well, that sounds painful.

524
00:33:40.938 --> 00:33:44.522
Yeah, it's like taking a nap. You smell
burnt toast, then everything goes dark.

525
00:33:45.526 --> 00:33:49.145
- Hey, don't worry, he's gonna wake up.
- Unless he doesn't.

526
00:33:49.238 --> 00:33:50.945
- What...?
- We should go.

527
00:33:51.031 --> 00:33:53.134
If we're in the building
when they do their security sweep,

528
00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:54.865
we're all going to German prison.

529
00:33:54.952 --> 00:33:56.989
And then it's schnitzel. All the time.

530
00:33:57.079 --> 00:33:58.536
Not such a bad deal, actually.

531
00:33:58.622 --> 00:34:00.659
Sabina, you get Calisto from the vault.

532
00:34:00.749 --> 00:34:02.832
Elena, you get the prototype from your lab.

533
00:34:02.918 --> 00:34:04.534
I'll keep security distracted.

534
00:34:04.628 --> 00:34:07.086
Okay. You ready?

535
00:34:07.172 --> 00:34:09.084
Yeah. High five. Girl power.

536
00:34:14.304 --> 00:34:15.385
Oh.

537
00:34:16.014 --> 00:34:17.014
Thank you.

538
00:34:22.271 --> 00:34:23.603
No puking.

550
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:18.692
Calisto's gone.

551

<i>It's not here. Someone beat us to it.</i>

552
00:35:20.913 --> 00:35:22.825
The plot thickens. Can you get an ID?

553
00:35:28.962 --> 00:35:31.170
There we go. Some guy. Peter Fleming.

554
00:35:31.256 --> 00:35:32.838
Let's see what Elena comes back with.

555
00:35:35.302 --> 00:35:37.134
Hold up. We might have another problem.

556
00:35:38.722 --> 00:35:40.884
Your boy Pradeep just showed up.

557
00:35:40.974 --> 00:35:44.843
Pradeep didn't spin? But he signed up
for the Groupon and everything.

558
00:35:44.937 --> 00:35:46.223

562
00:35:53.487 --> 00:35:55.444
but the system says
he's already in the building.

563
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.865
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a glitch. I think
the computer thinks Elena Houghlin is...

564
00:36:02.204 --> 00:36:05.572
I'm sending you an image of Elena Houghlin.
Get it to all our guys.

565
00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:08.204

Let's go.

571
00:36:44.246 --> 00:36:45.987
And here comes the cavalry.

572
00:36:47.124 --> 00:36:48.990
The heat is assembling, ladies.

573
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.079
Ohh. They know.
All right, meet me at the pickup.

574
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.797
Sabina? This one's real hard.

575
00:37:00.887 --> 00:37:04.176
I need you to exhibit
some attention-seeking behavior.

576
00:37:05.809 --> 00:37:07.220
I have so many ideas.

577
00:37:11.898 --> 00:37:12.898
Houghlin?

578
00:37:14.943 --> 00:37:15.943
Where is she?

579
00:37:17.195 --> 00:37:18.731
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

580
00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:20.438
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

581
00:37:20.532 --> 00:37:21.898
- Now I got her.
- Where?

582
00:37:21.992 --> 00:37:23.199
Here.

583
00:37:24.286 --> 00:37:25.286
Eleven?

584
00:37:25.912 --> 00:37:28.404
Guys, she's on 11.
Level 11, women's restroom.

585
00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:40.299
- Hi. Who are you?
- Shh.

586
00:37:40.385 --> 00:37:42.092
Sit down. Hands where I can see them.

587
00:37:47.809 --> 00:37:50.347
Are you with Health and Safety?

588
00:37:50.437 --> 00:37:52.975
God, these things are impossible to open.

589
00:37:57.486 --> 00:38:00.103
You're really not supposed
to be touching things in here

590
00:38:00.197 --> 00:38:02.814
unless you're supposed
to be touching things in here, you know?

591
00:38:11.666 --> 00:38:13.157
You put your mouth on it.

592
00:38:14.336 --> 00:38:17.750
Twenty billion bacteria reside
in the human mouth.

593
00:38:19.257 --> 00:38:20.589
You're adorable.

594
00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:23.001
<i>Jane?</i>

595
00:38:23.095 --> 00:38:24.381
Jane, is that you flirting?

596
00:38:36.191 --> 00:38:37.191
Hey!

597
00:38:38.401 --> 00:38:40.267
Stop! Hey!

598
00:38:41.655 --> 00:38:42.655
Hey!

599
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:16.230
Oh, come on.

600
00:39:37.002 --> 00:39:39.369
Heh, heh. You ready?

601
00:39:44.551 --> 00:39:45.587
Hey!

602
00:39:45.677 --> 00:39:46.677
Hey!

603
00:39:47.721 --> 00:39:48.757
Sorry!

604
00:39:48.847 --> 00:39:49.847
Hey!

605
00:39:52.601 --> 00:39:53.967
Get back here!

606
00:39:56.897 --> 00:39:57.897
Who has eyes on her?

607
00:39:57.981 --> 00:40:00.519
She set a fire on four.
We are following her down to three.

608
00:40:00.609 --> 00:40:03.977
- Let's go, guys! Come on.
- Three? She was on 11.

609
00:40:04.863 --> 00:40:06.946
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

610
00:40:09.492 --> 00:40:11.324
What did you...?

611
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:13.198
- Hold this.
- Okay.

612
00:40:14.206 --> 00:40:17.415
- Oh, that's... That's not you.
- No.

613
00:40:19.669 --> 00:40:21.331
- Hold this.
- Okay.

614
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.247
Can you unzip me?

615
00:40:24.341 --> 00:40:25.877
Yeah, yeah.

616
00:40:27.344 --> 00:40:28.344
Sorry.

617
00:40:33.892 --> 00:40:35.053
Bye.

618
00:40:35.936 --> 00:40:37.928
- You don't want your...?
- Keep it!

619
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.088
<i>Hello?</i>

620
00:41:03.089 --> 00:41:06.253
Hey, Susan. Mr. Fleming said he would like
to see you in the lab right away.

621
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:07.923
<i>- I'll be right there.</i>
- Okay. Thanks.

622
00:41:08.009 --> 00:41:09.500
- Did you see her?
- Yes.

623
00:41:09.594 --> 00:41:11.836
Not on-screen. With your eyes!

624
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:13.922
- You go there, you go there. Now!
- Okay!

625
00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:17.808
<i>I'm out.</i>

626
00:41:17.894 --> 00:41:18.894
I'm out.

627
00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:24.223
- Main lobby. I see her!
- Where?!

628
00:41:25.443 --> 00:41:27.526
Lobby level. Lobby level!

629
00:41:27.612 --> 00:41:29.023
Let's go, guys. Come on!

630
00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:32.069
Put your hands where I can see them.

631
00:41:33.243 --> 00:41:36.031
- Get on the ground! Now!
- Let me see your hands!

632
00:41:36.121 --> 00:41:39.364
- Do it!
- What for? I don't know. I don't know!

633
00:41:39.457 --> 00:41:42.291
I don't know what for.
What are you looking for?

634
00:41:42.377 --> 00:41:43.709
Sorry, Susan.

635
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.007
"Susan Olsen."

636
00:41:51.386 --> 00:41:55.130
Put all the exits on lockdown.
Sweep from the bottom up.

637
00:41:55.307 --> 00:41:56.889
Jane. I got it.

638
00:41:56.975 --> 00:41:59.388
The unit's gone. We need to go.
Someone beat us to it.

639
00:41:59.477 --> 00:42:01.434
Are you kidding? They were stolen?

640
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:03.057
Oh, no, no, no!

641
00:42:04.149 --> 00:42:05.149
God!

642
00:42:06.067 --> 00:42:07.933
Any ideas? Is there another way out of here?

643
00:42:08.028 --> 00:42:10.315
Wait, wait. I can hack this.

644
00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:13.523
Turn it into an EMP,
overload the electronics in the door.

645
00:42:13.616 --> 00:42:15.323
Won't that kill us in the process?

646
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:18.574
It's short proximity.
We should be okay if we keep our distance.

647
00:42:18.663 --> 00:42:19.663
How far?

648
00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:22.160
Here is far enough, I guess.

649
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.037
You guess? Do scientists usually guess?

650
00:42:24.127 --> 00:42:27.040
Of course. It's the first step
in the scientific method.

651
00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:28.541
Hypothesis.

652
00:42:29.466 --> 00:42:31.583
Calisto, short-range power burst.

653
00:42:31.676 --> 00:42:33.793
Okay, it's powering up. It's powering up.

654
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.466
This should work.

655
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:46.188
- Ralph.
- No.

656
00:42:46.274 --> 00:42:47.310
God.

657
00:42:50.278 --> 00:42:51.564
- I have time.
- No.

658
00:42:51.654 --> 00:42:54.317
- I have to. I have to.
- No. No. Stay here!

659
00:42:54.866 --> 00:42:57.404
Ralph? Ralph. Get over here now.

660
00:42:57.494 --> 00:42:59.486
- There you are.
- Ralph, it's about to blow.

661
00:42:59.579 --> 00:43:01.741
I can't stop it. Get over here.

662
00:43:01.831 --> 00:43:04.790
- You think I'll listen to you, Houghlin?
- Ralph! Come!

663
00:43:04.876 --> 00:43:07.196
- Get over here now!
- Put your hands where I can see them!

664
00:43:20.433 --> 00:43:22.516
Let's get out of here.
Do we need that thing?

665
00:43:22.602 --> 00:43:24.362
- No, it's useless now.
- Then leave it.

666
00:43:24.437 --> 00:43:26.804
Move it or lose it, ladies. We gotta go.

667
00:43:26.898 --> 00:43:29.641
Come on, come on. Get in.

668
00:43:42.789 --> 00:43:44.872
Do you think Ralph's gonna be okay?

669
00:43:46.042 --> 00:43:48.500
Oh, yeah. I'm sure he's fine.

670
00:43:48.586 --> 00:43:50.748
- He seemed fine, right?
- Yeah.

671
00:43:50.839 --> 00:43:53.331
I'm sure... I'm sure he's okay.
I'm sure he's fine.

672
00:43:58.805 --> 00:44:00.546
Oh, well, that's a shame.

673
00:44:02.142 --> 00:44:06.056
Obviously, this is a disappointing setback,
but we have time.

674
00:44:07.397 --> 00:44:10.185
Do you know what?
Just get John on the phone.

675
00:44:10.275 --> 00:44:11.275
Now.

676
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.356
Well, then wake him up.

677
00:44:19.826 --> 00:44:21.818
- Ahh!
- Everything all right?

678
00:44:24.581 --> 00:44:26.072

00:45:28.937 --> 00:45:31.145
All women are starving all the time.

695
00:45:35.068 --> 00:45:37.902
Oh, here they are. Welcome back.

696
00:45:39.739 --> 00:45:40.900
- Very <i>bien.</i>
- Good.

697
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.822
- Cool.
- Well...

698
00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:43.909
Hey.

699
00:45:45.703 --> 00:45:47.490
You owe me a burpee now, okay?

700
00:45:49.207 --> 00:45:50.207
Hey.

701
00:45:50.291 --> 00:45:52.658
- Bombay sister. How are you?
- Master.

702
00:45:52.752 --> 00:45:54.243
Good to see you.

703
00:45:54.337 --> 00:45:56.078
- This is Elena.
- Pleasure to meet you.

704
00:45:56.339 --> 00:45:57.955
- Saint.
- Wow.

705
00:45:58.716 --> 00:46:01.959
Wow. You have this beautiful energy.

706
00:46:02.053 --> 00:46:03.919
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

707
00:46:04.013 --> 00:46:04.973
Oh, Jesus.

708
00:46:04.974 --> 00:46:07.306
- Oh, wait, what?
- Oh, my God.

709
00:46:07.392 --> 00:46:08.633
Oh, no.

710
00:46:09.435 --> 00:46:12.599
I would love to apply
a firm touch to your back.

711
00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:14.976
- Do you consent?
- Yeah, sure.

712
00:46:15.066 --> 00:46:17.183
Okay. Just let me try to find this.

713
00:46:18.403 --> 00:46:20.645
Oh! Oh, yeah.

714
00:46:21.406 --> 00:46:23.739
- Good?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Amazing.

715
00:46:23.825 --> 00:46:25.987
Displaced rib. Very common.

716
00:46:26.077 --> 00:46:28.535
If you ever need additional adjustments,
I'm here for you.

717
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:30.863
The Saint takes care of our health
and well-being.

718
00:46:30.957 --> 00:46:33.574
- Keeps us in fighting shape, you know?
- Yeah. Well, I try.

719
00:46:33.668 --> 00:46:36.126
He feeds our mind, body and soul.

720
00:46:36.212 --> 00:46:39.171
Oh, should we take a moment
to remember Edgar?

721
00:46:40.258 --> 00:46:44.047
I prepared a mini feast
to honor our beautiful friend.

722
00:46:45.138 --> 00:46:48.973
I got Pecorino Nero,
Parmigiano-Reggiano, Manchego,

723
00:46:49.058 --> 00:46:51.641
- and, of course...
- Thanks.

724
00:46:51.728 --> 00:46:53.139
- He loved Brie.
- Yeah.

725
00:46:53.229 --> 00:46:56.597
- Ah. And wine.
- Especially wine.

726
00:46:57.066 --> 00:47:00.480
Wow, I thought you guys were gonna serve,
like, bean sprouts and wheatgrass.

727
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.984
Eating is all about the intention
you put into your meal.

728
00:47:04.073 --> 00:47:07.441
If you honor the cow,
the cheese is gonna be good for you.

729
00:47:08.494 --> 00:47:12.078
By the way, I understand the circumstances
that brought you here have been stressful.

730
00:47:12.165 --> 00:47:13.406
So stressful.

731
00:47:13.499 --> 00:47:16.287
If you ever need to talk,
I'm also a licensed psychotherapist.

732
00:47:16.419 --> 00:47:17.751
Wow.

733
00:47:17.879 --> 00:47:20.747
- I can see why you guys call him...
- The Saint.

734
00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.547
Yes. Okay.

735
00:47:22.634 --> 00:47:25.251
- Oh! Electrolyte-enhanced water?
- Fine.

736
00:47:25.345 --> 00:47:28.383
Oh, and also try this.
It's really good for your breath.

737
00:47:29.724 --> 00:47:31.340
Oh, thank you.

738
00:47:31.434 --> 00:47:32.434
Good.

739
00:47:35.229 --> 00:47:38.939
I sent the ID of the last person to access
the Calisto vault through our search system,

740
00:47:39.025 --> 00:47:41.984
ran every CCTV and security cam in Hamburg.

741
00:47:43.321 --> 00:47:46.314
Fleming. That's my...
That's the guy that buried my report.

742
00:47:46.491 --> 00:47:48.733
- Hm.
- Look. There.

743
00:47:48.826 --> 00:47:50.692
He was at the airport five hours ago.

744
00:47:51.245 --> 00:47:53.237
- So he's left Germany.
- With the case.

745
00:47:53.331 --> 00:47:55.197
He knows exactly what Calisto can do.

746
00:47:55.291 --> 00:47:57.408
Then he knows what it's worth
on the black market.

747
00:47:57.502 --> 00:48:00.711
If he's selling it, he'd want you
out of the way. I'm broadening the search.

748
00:48:00.797 --> 00:48:03.164
I'm sorry.
So Fleming tried to have me killed?

749
00:48:03.257 --> 00:48:06.250
Maybe. Maybe at the direction of a buyer.

750
00:48:06.344 --> 00:48:09.178
Bad guys don't like loose ends,
you made a fancy new toy...

751
00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:11.551
But I worked for him. I mean...

752
00:48:13.434 --> 00:48:14.641
he flirted with me.

753
00:48:14.727 --> 00:48:16.218
Oh, honey.

754
00:48:16.312 --> 00:48:19.020
A man can love you and want you dead.

755
00:48:19.107 --> 00:48:22.066
- Not me.
- There was a gunfight at my wedding.

756
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:25.315
- Wait, you're married?
- No. I was the better shot.

757
00:48:26.656 --> 00:48:28.022
All right. I need cheese.

758
00:48:28.116 --> 00:48:30.984
- "Cheese." Is that a code for something?
- Yes.

759
00:48:31.077 --> 00:48:35.868
It's code for "I'm 40 and single, and I have
a cheese-size hole in my soul to fill."

760
00:48:35.957 --> 00:48:38.074
I also have some vegan ice cream
for your soul.

761
00:48:38.167 --> 00:48:39.703
You really know what I need.

762
00:48:39.794 --> 00:48:44.084
I should have just gone around Fleming and
not followed some stupid chain of command.

763
00:48:44.173 --> 00:48:48.133
Gone directly to Brok.
But, no, I just rolled over.

764
00:48:48.219 --> 00:48:51.633
And you're probably the last people
that would know what that feels like.

765
00:48:51.723 --> 00:48:54.090
I grew up with major abandonment issues.

766
00:48:54.183 --> 00:48:56.391
It led to some pretty
self-sabotaging behavior,

767
00:48:56.477 --> 00:48:59.265
which then landed me
in various institutional facilities.

768
00:48:59.772 --> 00:49:00.888
Charlie bailed me out.

769
00:49:01.566 --> 00:49:03.398
And if it wasn't for Charlie,

770
00:49:05.194 --> 00:49:08.528
I'd probably be dead or back in prison,
so I feel you.

771
00:49:08.614 --> 00:49:12.278
I pretty much grew up
on the corner of powerless and ashamed.

772
00:49:12.368 --> 00:49:14.735
Wait. You grew up on Park Avenue.
Aren't you an heiress?

773
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:18.325
More money, more problems.

774
00:49:19.417 --> 00:49:21.500
So, what about you?
How did Charlie find you?

775
00:49:21.586 --> 00:49:24.795
Jane is former MI6. Youngest recruit ever.

776
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:26.463
You worked for British intelligence?

777
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:28.040
She said "former."

778
00:49:28.634 --> 00:49:30.421
I also followed the rules.

779
00:49:30.511 --> 00:49:34.050
The chain of command didn't work out
so well for me either.

780
00:49:36.267 --> 00:49:38.054
Ralph's dead.

781
00:49:38.144 --> 00:49:39.976
I killed Ralph.

782
00:49:40.062 --> 00:49:41.269
I'm a murderer.

783
00:49:41.355 --> 00:49:42.596
- No.
- No, no, no.

784
00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.147
Collateral damage.

785
00:49:44.233 --> 00:49:45.849
I wouldn't take that on.

786
00:49:45.943 --> 00:49:48.811
The point is,
if Calisto falls in the wrong hands...

787
00:49:49.572 --> 00:49:53.156
I mean, we have to get it back
before it hurts more people.

788
00:49:55.328 --> 00:49:57.320
Well, now's our chance.

789
00:49:57.413 --> 00:50:00.747
Mr. Fleming just cleared
passport control in Istanbul.

790
00:50:02.043 --> 00:50:03.375
- No.
- No.

791
00:50:04.128 --> 00:50:05.790
What's your problem with Istanbul?

792
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.044
I got food poisoning from undercooked lamb
and yogurt sauce that I left out,

793
00:50:09.133 --> 00:50:10.419
but then I got hungry.

794
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:12.843
- What about you?
- Not that.

795
00:50:13.763 --> 00:50:14.763
Will you excuse us?

796
00:50:17.141 --> 00:50:18.632
We'll be right back.

797
00:50:21.145 --> 00:50:25.185
I wanna be sure
that assassin stays away from us.

798
00:50:25.274 --> 00:50:28.267
We should keep this quiet
until we know who all the players are.

799
00:50:28.361 --> 00:50:32.355
We don't know what this Calisto is
or who wants it, so let's play it safe.

800
00:50:33.324 --> 00:50:34.906
What about Ralph-killer in there?

801
00:50:36.285 --> 00:50:38.618
Take her to the closet, gear her up.

802
00:50:38.704 --> 00:50:42.573
And if anybody asks, we're going to Brazil.

803
00:50:42.667 --> 00:50:43.667
Okay.

804
00:51:00.768 --> 00:51:01.768
Istanbul.

805
00:51:06.274 --> 00:51:09.608
- What about Elena Houghlin?
- I think you know what to do.

806
00:51:27.378 --> 00:51:28.710
<i>I took it apart.</i>

807
00:51:28.796 --> 00:51:29.796
Nothing.

808
00:51:30.381 --> 00:51:32.122
No tracker.

809
00:51:33.301 --> 00:51:36.635
It's not emitting any signals.
What had you worried?

810
00:51:38.222 --> 00:51:39.929
To be honest, I don't know.

811
00:51:40.016 --> 00:51:41.427
A feeling.

812
00:51:41.517 --> 00:51:43.383
Something in the bones.

813
00:51:43.477 --> 00:51:45.309
Old habits.

814
00:51:45.396 --> 00:51:47.934
Perhaps it's simply that you miss the job.

815
00:51:48.024 --> 00:51:50.016
We all get old, my friend.

816
00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:52.476
Retirement is not a death sentence.

817
00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:55.358
Says the man who refuses to retire.

818
00:51:58.576 --> 00:51:59.576
Come on.

819
00:52:15.259 --> 00:52:17.342
Something in the bones, indeed.

820
00:52:17.428 --> 00:52:19.215
Who would do this to you?

821
00:52:26.437 --> 00:52:28.895
Someone who knows I'm on to her.

822
00:52:31.817 --> 00:52:32.817
Thank you.

823
00:52:48.376 --> 00:52:50.959
Look at this.

824
00:52:51.963 --> 00:52:55.127
This is the closet of my dreams.

825
00:52:55.216 --> 00:52:57.674
And I just get to take whatever I want?

826
00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.841
Borrow.

827
00:52:59.679 --> 00:53:02.046
- Oh.
- Is that an actual rule?

828
00:53:02.139 --> 00:53:06.850
Okay. So you wanna start
with a protective base layer.

829
00:53:06.936 --> 00:53:10.225
I recommend a beaded camisole. Yeah?

830
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:13.648
Huh. Some kind of polymer material.

831
00:53:13.734 --> 00:53:15.976
Bulletproof, composite body armor.

832
00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:19.279
It was originally developed
as a protective layer for spacecraft.

833
00:53:19.365 --> 00:53:22.824
Yeah. And it's a bra that doesn't dig.
Progress.

834
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.367
How we doing down here?

835
00:53:25.538 --> 00:53:27.404
Ah. We're still in the first closet.

836
00:53:29.792 --> 00:53:31.328
There's another closet?

837
00:53:32.253 --> 00:53:33.369
Armory open.

838
00:53:37.341 --> 00:53:38.752
Jane, I wanna show you something.

839
00:53:43.347 --> 00:53:44.347
Whoa.

840
00:53:45.099 --> 00:53:46.306
Check it out.

841
00:53:47.518 --> 00:53:49.384
- Try these on.
- Oh, thank you.

842
00:53:49.478 --> 00:53:51.640
Why? What do they do? Whoa.

843
00:53:51.731 --> 00:53:54.064
What do they do? Whoa.

844
00:53:56.485 --> 00:54:00.024
- Huh. You're younger than I thought.
- I've lived hard.

845
00:54:00.114 --> 00:54:03.573
Do you think you can put that MIT degree
to use with something like this?

846
00:54:03.659 --> 00:54:05.491
- What is it?
- Universal Interface.

847
00:54:05.578 --> 00:54:07.444
- Lets you hack into almost anything.
- Mm-mm.

848
00:54:07.538 --> 00:54:09.951
Not almost anything. Everything.

849
00:54:10.041 --> 00:54:12.328
- So here's the new baby.
- Oh. What's that?

850
00:54:12.418 --> 00:54:17.288
High-velocity rifle,
customized to fire tranquilizer darts.

851
00:54:17.381 --> 00:54:20.545
nonlethal, fast-acting, very potent.

852
00:54:20.634 --> 00:54:22.612
Jane, you have a new cuddle buddy.

853
00:54:22.636 --> 00:54:23.636
Oh, Jesus.

854
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:25.883
Shall we fit Elena with comms?

855
00:54:25.973 --> 00:54:27.214
I think so.

856
00:54:27.308 --> 00:54:30.847
- Oh, that in-ear radio thing you guys have?
- Even better.

857
00:54:30.936 --> 00:54:34.930
It's a subdermal transmitter.
Works through bone conduction. See?

858
00:54:35.024 --> 00:54:36.686
So I'm getting a tattoo?

859
00:54:38.444 --> 00:54:42.779
No. Tattoos are earned by Angels over time.
You'll get a less permanent version.

860
00:54:42.865 --> 00:54:45.983
- Yeah, comms are concealed in the link.
- Oh.

861
00:54:46.077 --> 00:54:48.160
As long as you have it on, you can hear us.

862
00:54:48.245 --> 00:54:49.736
Cool. Hey, can I take these mints?

863
00:54:51.248 --> 00:54:53.456
No. Avoid the mints.

864
00:54:53.542 --> 00:54:55.875
Actually,
let's just stop the touching around here.

865
00:54:55.961 --> 00:54:58.453
- You know, some of this blows up.
- Oh.

866
00:55:13.771 --> 00:55:15.353
This place is amazing.

867
00:55:15.439 --> 00:55:18.102
It's the crossroads of the world.
Danger and money.

868
00:55:18.192 --> 00:55:21.526
We need to figure out where
Mr. Fleming's meeting his mystery buyer

869
00:55:21.612 --> 00:55:25.481
and get Calisto back before it becomes
every bad guy's favorite new weapon.

870
00:55:25.574 --> 00:55:28.533
- Like suitcase nukes.
- Pet tigers.

871
00:55:28.619 --> 00:55:30.736
- Jet Skis.
- Sea-Doos.

872
00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:33.573
Cars that go fast really furiously.

873
00:55:33.666 --> 00:55:34.998
So how do we find him?

874
00:55:35.084 --> 00:55:38.202
Well, we're off the agency's grid here, so...

875
00:55:38.295 --> 00:55:42.835
How do we find him?
We hit the streets. We go old-school.

876
00:55:42.925 --> 00:55:45.463
We sling some bills. We get violent.

877
00:55:45.553 --> 00:55:49.968
I feel like a tiger today, maybe a leopard.
But either way, I am down to get wild.

878
00:55:50.057 --> 00:55:53.471
I might have a contact here.
An asset from when I was with MI6.

879
00:55:53.561 --> 00:55:54.561
"Might" as in?

880
00:55:54.645 --> 00:55:58.013
As in she definitely lives here
and she definitely hates me.

881
00:56:08.784 --> 00:56:10.195
Practice your English?

882
00:56:10.286 --> 00:56:12.198
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Well done.

883
00:56:12.288 --> 00:56:13.324
Candy!

884
00:56:13.414 --> 00:56:14.780
Candy.

885
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.662
Still spoiling the local kids?

886
00:56:19.962 --> 00:56:22.579
You. Get away from me.

887
00:56:22.673 --> 00:56:23.673
Fatima, wait.

888
00:56:24.383 --> 00:56:25.965
Please, just talk to me.

889
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:28.634
Go talk to someone else.
I can't get involved with you again.

890
00:56:28.721 --> 00:56:30.257
Fatima, please wait.

891
00:56:30.347 --> 00:56:32.464
I waited for you already.

892
00:56:32.558 --> 00:56:33.558
Remember?

893
00:56:34.518 --> 00:56:38.182
And I wasn't there for you,
but I don't work for MI6 anymore.

894
00:56:38.272 --> 00:56:40.889
- I work for these people now.
- I don't care.

895
00:56:40.983 --> 00:56:42.474
I don't help you.

896
00:56:42.568 --> 00:56:43.934
You know why.

897
00:56:44.904 --> 00:56:48.147
They are very well-funded.
Non-governmental, NGO.

898
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.324
They can get you whatever you need
to get you up and running again today.

899
00:56:51.410 --> 00:56:53.823
No waiting. No broken promises.

900
00:57:01.295 --> 00:57:02.295
Thank you.

901
00:57:02.713 --> 00:57:04.045
It's only tea.

902
00:57:06.508 --> 00:57:08.249
What do you want from me?

903
00:57:16.268 --> 00:57:17.850
Have you seen this man?

904
00:57:21.315 --> 00:57:22.476
Maybe...

905
00:57:23.692 --> 00:57:25.524
you know someone who has.

906
00:57:27.655 --> 00:57:28.655
Please.

907
00:57:28.989 --> 00:57:30.605
I can help you.

908
00:57:30.699 --> 00:57:32.110
Rebuild the clinic.

909
00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:35.194
- You can help me now?
- I'm sorry.

910
00:57:35.287 --> 00:57:38.200
I believed them when they told me
my asset was safe.

911
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:40.907
And I believed you, but I lost everything.

912
00:57:41.001 --> 00:57:45.086
I had to turn away unwed mothers
I could no longer help.

913
00:57:45.172 --> 00:57:46.172
I know.

914
00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:49.836
It's why I quit.

915
00:57:53.514 --> 00:57:55.927
But let me rebuild our trust.

916
00:57:59.061 --> 00:58:00.552
I brought you the usual.

917
00:58:03.524 --> 00:58:04.765
It's right outside.

918
00:58:10.906 --> 00:58:12.067
Show me.

919
00:58:15.244 --> 00:58:17.782
I can get you another shipment
in six months.

920
00:58:18.247 --> 00:58:19.247
Four.

921
00:58:22.793 --> 00:58:25.877
So how long will it take
for your sources to find our guy?

922
00:58:25.963 --> 00:58:27.579
Because we really need to...

923
00:58:31.093 --> 00:58:33.176
Is this what the doctor ordered?

924
00:58:33.262 --> 00:58:34.343
Okay.

925
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:36.217
Let's get this off the street.

926
00:58:36.307 --> 00:58:37.388
All right.

927
00:58:40.602 --> 00:58:41.718
Good job, Jane.

928
00:58:47.234 --> 00:58:51.103
Your man is in a hotel. The Pasha Hotel.

929
00:58:51.196 --> 00:58:52.403
The Ibrahim Pasha?

930
00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:56.028
Do you know anybody
who can get us into his room?

931
00:58:56.118 --> 00:58:57.359
Of course.

932
00:58:57.453 --> 00:58:59.319
I will take the van too.

933
00:59:07.046 --> 00:59:08.253
Of course.

934
00:59:12.343 --> 00:59:14.050
Pasha. Let's go.

<i>When Fleming goes out, we go in.</i>

941
00:59:36.742 --> 00:59:39.701
<i>Double his devices.

<i>The when, the where, the who.</i>

943
00:59:43.165 --> 00:59:45.373
He's been looking at property in Costa Rica.

944
00:59:46.502 --> 00:59:48.585
And he's got an offshore bank account.

945
00:59:49.963 --> 00:59:51.044

01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:04.611
- No, I can't find my hat.
- Let me help you with that.

963
01:01:04.705 --> 01:01:06.571
Thank you. Yes. Thank you.

964
01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.497
Have you seen my phone?

965
01:01:10.669 --> 01:01:12.251
- Your bag.
- Oh, thanks.

966
01:01:13.714 --> 01:01:15.376
- Oh, there it is.
- Thank you.

967
01:01:19.887 --> 01:01:21.003
<i>Here it is.</i>

968
01:01:21.096 --> 01:01:22.240
<i>We filtered his communications,</i>

969
01:01:22.264 --> 01:01:26.634
and it seems Mr. Fleming is selling Calisto
tomorrow at the Turkish derby.

970
01:01:26.727 --> 01:01:28.343
Veliefendi Hippodrome.

971
01:01:30.105 --> 01:01:33.348
<i>This particular racetrack is popular
with a syndicate of wealthy businessmen.</i>

972
01:01:33.442 --> 01:01:36.935
<i>No doubt with connections to
international arms deals, drug trade and...</i>

973
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:39.487
<i>All parties who might be
interested in Calisto.</i>

974
01:01:39.573 --> 01:01:40.654
<i>Familiarize yourselves.</i>

975
01:01:40.741 --> 01:01:43.654
<i>The syndicate members,
wealthy horse owners expected to attend.</i>

976
01:01:43.744 --> 01:01:45.513
<i>Flag anyone
Fleming could be in business with.</i>

977
01:01:45.537 --> 01:01:46.573
I wanna help.

978
01:01:48.123 --> 01:01:52.993
Look, I am not just some frightened girl
in your witness protection program.

979
01:01:53.086 --> 01:01:56.204
If you need help getting in
and out of someplace, I can do it.

980
01:01:56.298 --> 01:01:59.757
I can hack any system and I can do it fast.

981
01:01:59.843 --> 01:02:01.675
You need me, Mrs. Bosley.

982
01:02:01.762 --> 01:02:04.675
Don't tell me I can't do it
because I know I can.

983
01:02:04.765 --> 01:02:07.007
I'm done sitting still.

984
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.558
I've had a taste. I want more.

985
01:02:11.438 --> 01:02:12.599
I want in.

986
01:02:14.399 --> 01:02:17.517
You know, I once saw a really fat baby

987
01:02:17.611 --> 01:02:20.524
giving Eskimo kisses to a kitten.

988
01:02:21.823 --> 01:02:23.439
And that was more adorable.

989
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.244
Also, it's implied that you're coming
with us because you're in this briefing.

990
01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:32.540
Yeah, she gave you the universal
hacking tool and the bracelet, right?

991
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:35.372
Mm-hm. Yeah.

992
01:02:35.462 --> 01:02:38.671
But how'd that feel?
It looked like it felt really good.

993
01:02:39.341 --> 01:02:41.549
- Felt nice.
- I was just gonna give you

994
01:02:41.635 --> 01:02:43.297
the tablet once I was done.

995
01:02:43.387 --> 01:02:44.387
Mm.

996
01:02:48.392 --> 01:02:49.553
- Carry on.
- Great.

997
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:51.635
As I was about to say,

998
01:02:52.271 --> 01:02:55.059
<i>there's a lot of ground to cover,
so we'll need to spread out.</i>

999
01:02:55.899 --> 01:02:58.562
<i>Elena, you'll be our eye in the sky.</i>

1000
01:02:58.652 --> 01:03:02.396
<i>The track's mainframe's located
just inside the press box.</i>

1001
01:03:02.489 --> 01:03:05.607
<i>We'll get you in.
You hack into the security cameras.</i>

1002
01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:07.237
<i>Watch for Mr. Fleming.</i>

1003
01:03:11.248 --> 01:03:12.830
<i>Jane's on crowd control.</i>

1004
01:03:12.916 --> 01:03:15.283
<i>Turkish derby attracts
thousands of spectators</i>

1005
01:03:15.377 --> 01:03:17.790
<i>who need to be scanned and assessed.</i>

1006
01:03:21.258 --> 01:03:25.468
<i>Start low, go high. From your nest,
you can provide tactical support.</i>

1007
01:03:25.554 --> 01:03:27.796
<i>Take out any threats to the operation.</i>

1008
01:03:29.182 --> 01:03:33.893
<i>Sabina, you'll run the ground game. Once
the target's on site, you make the grab.</i>

1009
01:03:33.979 --> 01:03:36.813
<i>We need Fleming, his buyer and Calisto.</i>

1010
01:03:36.898 --> 01:03:37.934
<i>No loose ends.</i>

1011
01:03:41.361 --> 01:03:44.229
<i>I'll take care of the transportation,
and prep for extraction.</i>

1012
01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.609
<i>We're taking everybody out of there with us.
I have just the vehicle to do it.</i>

1013
01:03:49.536 --> 01:03:52.700
Okay, and I'm in.

1014
01:03:56.668 --> 01:03:57.704
Okay, Jane.

1015
01:03:58.211 --> 01:04:00.294
Ah. There you are.

1016
01:04:04.509 --> 01:04:05.920
Comm check. Sabina.

1017
01:04:06.011 --> 01:04:07.011
Good.

1018
01:04:07.012 --> 01:04:08.548
<i>- Jane.</i>
- Good.

1019
01:04:08.639 --> 01:04:11.256
- Elena.
<i>- Good.</i>

1020
01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:12.682
Don't talk into your bracelet.

1021
01:04:14.728 --> 01:04:17.015
I just missed a superfecta.

1022
01:04:17.105 --> 01:04:19.313
Better luck in the third run, I hope.

1023
01:04:21.526 --> 01:04:23.233
Hey, what's your bet?

1024
01:04:24.738 --> 01:04:25.738
Um...

1025
01:04:28.408 --> 01:04:29.408
The blue one.

1026
01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:32.119
Hm.

1027
01:04:35.374 --> 01:04:37.957
Six minutes to post time.
Anybody see anything?

1028
01:04:39.461 --> 01:04:40.668
Nothing yet.

1029
01:04:44.841 --> 01:04:46.207
<i>Jane, you got anything yet?</i>

1030
01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:48.251
Nothing.

1031
01:04:56.311 --> 01:04:58.394
Excuse me, who is that?

1032
01:04:59.147 --> 01:05:00.729
Alim Hassan.

1033
01:05:00.816 --> 01:05:01.977
Qatari prince.

1034
01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:04.684
- Oh, "Qatari prince."
- Yeah, serious money.

1035
01:05:04.778 --> 01:05:06.895
- "Serious money."
- Owns hundreds of horses.

1036
01:05:06.988 --> 01:05:09.822
- "Owns hundreds of horses"?
- Yeah.

1037
01:05:10.701 --> 01:05:11.942
<i>We get it. He's rich.</i>

1038
01:05:12.035 --> 01:05:13.071
Is he the buyer?

1039
01:05:13.745 --> 01:05:15.532
<i>I don't have an angle.</i>

1040
01:05:16.206 --> 01:05:18.243
Sabina! Fleming.

1041
01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:20.791
<i>That's him. Light blue suit!</i>

1042
01:05:26.174 --> 01:05:27.790
Yeah, he's here.

1043
01:05:27.884 --> 01:05:30.376
That's definitely him. Sabina?

1044
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:31.470
Got him.

1045
01:05:33.765 --> 01:05:34.801
He has the goods.

1046
01:05:35.434 --> 01:05:36.434
Moving in.

1047
01:05:39.354 --> 01:05:40.354
Jane?

1048
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.857
In my sights. Boz?

1049
01:05:45.944 --> 01:05:47.355
The ride is ready.

1050
01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.817
He's talking to somebody. Gray suit.

1051
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:55.151
Is that the buyer?

1052
01:05:59.124 --> 01:06:02.333
- It's the assassin.
- Bae showed up.

1053
01:06:02.419 --> 01:06:05.162
If you think you're killing him before I do,
I'll kill you first.

1054
01:06:05.255 --> 01:06:06.917
Take the shot, Jane. Bag him.

1055
01:06:10.469 --> 01:06:11.710
In the car? All right.

1056
01:06:17.517 --> 01:06:18.517
Oh, shit.

1057
01:06:18.602 --> 01:06:20.935
They're in the Mercedes.
There's no sale here.

1058
01:06:21.021 --> 01:06:23.229
- We gotta go! Get down here.
- I'm coming!

1059
01:06:24.065 --> 01:06:25.806
Shit, shit!

1060
01:06:25.901 --> 01:06:26.901
Shit!

1061
01:06:30.155 --> 01:06:32.943
<i>- Sabina, get a tracker on that Mercedes!</i>
- On it!

1062
01:06:46.087 --> 01:06:47.453
Come on! Hyah!

1063
01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:54.386
Come on.

1064
01:06:55.722 --> 01:06:56.722
Coming in!

1065
01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.636
Come on. Move, move, move.

1066
01:07:00.727 --> 01:07:02.764
<i>- Come on, Elena!</i>
- I'm coming!

1067
01:07:14.866 --> 01:07:16.198
Go, go, go!

1068
01:07:18.578 --> 01:07:19.864
Come on!

1069
01:07:47.399 --> 01:07:48.685
- Giddyup.
- Sabina!

1070
01:07:48.775 --> 01:07:50.186
- Hey, guys.
- Get in here.

1071
01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:53.481
Okay, punch it.

1072
01:07:53.572 --> 01:07:55.438
- Here we go! Great job!
- Whoo!

1073
01:07:55.532 --> 01:07:58.900
How did you...?
I didn't know you could jump horses.

1074
01:07:59.619 --> 01:08:01.986
- More money, more horses.
- Oh.

1075
01:08:02.622 --> 01:08:04.739
Can somebody please track this mofo?

1076
01:08:06.042 --> 01:08:07.658
We cannot tail him in this.

1077
01:08:09.004 --> 01:08:10.290
Oh. Hold on.

1078
01:08:23.226 --> 01:08:25.218
They're headed north out of town.

1079
01:08:29.691 --> 01:08:31.353
We've left city limits.

1080
01:08:31.443 --> 01:08:34.026
There's nothing out here but a rock quarry.

1081
01:08:36.323 --> 01:08:37.439
Bring up the specs.

1082
01:08:57.302 --> 01:08:59.840
I'll circle until you signal.

1083
01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:02.343
The sale will definitely go down here.

1084
01:09:02.432 --> 01:09:04.845
Let's take everything.
We don't know who's in there.

1085
01:09:04.935 --> 01:09:07.177
I think I'm a little overdressed.

1086
01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:10.940
Okay.

1087
01:09:12.233 --> 01:09:13.269
You need this.

1088
01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:30.248
I see a way in.

1089
01:09:31.336 --> 01:09:33.168
Jane! Jane!

1090
01:09:38.885 --> 01:09:39.885
Come on.

1091
01:10:06.746 --> 01:10:07.907
In your dreams.

1092
01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.460
Hi.

1093
01:10:19.009 --> 01:10:21.046
Hey, he's gonna wake up. Come on.

1094
01:10:27.183 --> 01:10:28.674
You've got all the dots.

1095
01:10:28.768 --> 01:10:30.600
I signaled you, you went rogue.

1096
01:10:30.687 --> 01:10:32.599
- Should we toss him?
- Yeah, let's do it.

1097
01:10:38.695 --> 01:10:40.106
Man.

1098
01:10:40.196 --> 01:10:43.405
Whoever Fleming's in business with,
he is in way over his head.

1099
01:10:43.491 --> 01:10:45.653
Seal that gate. Lock them in.

1100
01:10:46.494 --> 01:10:48.907
- Then lock yourself in here.
- Okay.

1101
01:10:49.956 --> 01:10:51.037
These are for you.

1102
01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:53.625
They are not mints.

1103
01:10:54.252 --> 01:10:55.584
You got it?

1104
01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:56.670
Not mints.

1105
01:10:56.755 --> 01:10:58.496
- Let's go.
- Lock this. Not mints.

1106
01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:00.001
- No, I know.
- Lock it!

1107
01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:18.183
Okay, the gate is locked.
Only other exit is up three stories.

1108
01:11:18.276 --> 01:11:19.687
Nicely done, Elena.

1109
01:11:39.756 --> 01:11:40.963
There he is.

1110
01:11:41.591 --> 01:11:42.957
Mr. Fleming.

1111
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:44.051
Yes.

1112
01:11:44.094 --> 01:11:47.132
- That's Australian Jonny.
- Didn't we hand him over to the Americans?

1113
01:11:47.639 --> 01:11:51.974
Well, he's here. If you think
you're gonna kill me before I kill him...

1114
01:11:53.311 --> 01:11:56.850
- What was the thing you said?
- So you are...?

1115
01:11:57.816 --> 01:11:59.023
I represent a buyer

1116
01:11:59.109 --> 01:12:01.476
- who wishes to remain anonymous.
- Ah.

1117
01:12:02.028 --> 01:12:03.189
Let's have a look.

1118
01:12:03.613 --> 01:12:04.613
Of course.

1119
01:12:06.282 --> 01:12:07.739
<i>Guys, that's Calisto.</i>

1120
01:12:08.201 --> 01:12:09.692
There we go.

1121
01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.080
The money?

1122
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.040
COD.

1123
01:12:16.417 --> 01:12:18.079
Plus wire transfer.

1124
01:12:20.255 --> 01:12:21.371
Great.

1125
01:12:21.464 --> 01:12:23.251
Before we close the deal,

1126
01:12:23.341 --> 01:12:27.460
my employer would like
a little demonstration just to make sure

1127
01:12:27.554 --> 01:12:29.341
the devices do what you say.

1128
01:12:34.352 --> 01:12:36.059
You want me to kill somebody?

1129
01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:38.228
Damn.

1130
01:12:38.314 --> 01:12:41.398
No, I don't, but my employer insists.

1131
01:12:41.484 --> 01:12:42.725
<i>So, yes.</i>

1132
01:12:43.319 --> 01:12:44.319
<i>Pick anybody.</i>

1133
01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.777
Obviously don't pick me.

1134
01:12:48.241 --> 01:12:51.029
- Sidam, go get somebody.
- No, no, no.

1135
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:55.488
I... I gave you the report.

1136
01:12:55.582 --> 01:13:00.122
It's all outlined in there,
so that was never part of the deal.

1137
01:13:00.211 --> 01:13:03.454
<i>Well, Mr. Fleming, it is now.</i>

1138
01:13:03.548 --> 01:13:06.291
<i>Look, it's a complicated process.</i>

1139
01:13:06.384 --> 01:13:09.218
<i>- Obviously, I don't...</i>
- You don't even know how it works, do you?

1140
01:13:09.304 --> 01:13:10.966
<i>It'll require root access</i>

1141
01:13:11.055 --> 01:13:12.796
or a world-class hacker.

1142
01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:18.557
Whoa! Whoa!
What are you thinking? Bloody hell!

1143
01:13:18.646 --> 01:13:21.263
That was not part of the plan, Mr. Hodak!

1144
01:13:22.442 --> 01:13:23.442
Damn it!

1145
01:13:24.527 --> 01:13:28.396
Boz, Fleming is down.
The assassin works for Jonny Smith.

1146
01:13:29.824 --> 01:13:30.985
<i>Boz.</i>

1147
01:13:31.075 --> 01:13:32.737
We need to engage. Ready for exfil?

1148
01:13:32.827 --> 01:13:35.820
Let's get out of here!
Someone grab that. Get me out of here.

1149
01:13:37.832 --> 01:13:39.198
Boz, they are leaving.

1150
01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:40.999
<i>Go, no-go?</i>

1151
01:13:42.337 --> 01:13:43.578
Where the hell is she?

1152
01:13:44.339 --> 01:13:45.830
I can't see her anywhere.

1153
01:13:49.802 --> 01:13:52.089
- It won't open.
- Well, then fix it.

1154
01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.762
Go upstairs and fix it.

1155
01:13:58.353 --> 01:14:00.185
Oh, no. Guys, someone's coming.

1156
01:14:01.439 --> 01:14:02.850
<i>He's headed your way.</i>

1157
01:14:23.544 --> 01:14:24.544
Together.

1158
01:14:40.228 --> 01:14:41.844
- Up there!
- Shit.

1159
01:14:43.398 --> 01:14:45.310
- Find them!
- Oh, my God. Guys?

1160
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.732
- Go!
<i>- What's happening?</i>

1161
01:14:48.278 --> 01:14:50.520
I'll take the assassin. Cover me.

1162
01:14:50.613 --> 01:14:52.775
Go. Go, go, go!

1163
01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.041
Miss Independent.

1164
01:15:16.723 --> 01:15:17.930
Just a minute!

1165
01:15:23.688 --> 01:15:24.804
Who are you?

1166
01:15:24.897 --> 01:15:26.229
Hyah! Oh.

1167
01:15:28.443 --> 01:15:30.685
Stay away. I know Krav Maga.

1168
01:15:30.778 --> 01:15:33.020
Where you learn? Shopping mall?

1169
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:36.948
One! Two! Three!

1170
01:15:37.035 --> 01:15:38.651
Krav Maga! Yeah.

1171
01:15:44.125 --> 01:15:45.332
Don't shoot.

1172
01:15:45.418 --> 01:15:47.785
Jonny Australia, the pleasure is all yours.

1173
01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:52.341
Come on.

1174
01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:56.506
Jane, where's that sleepy-neck button?

1175
01:15:56.596 --> 01:15:58.132
<i>I'm a little busy. Figure it out!</i>

1176
01:16:03.394 --> 01:16:06.307
- Ohh!
- Elena? Help me!

1177
01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:23.446
Thanks, Elena.

1178
01:16:23.539 --> 01:16:26.748
I have dreamed of this moment
since the day I met you.

1179
01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:29.747
Except your hair was longer.
But I like this too. This is great.

1180
01:16:35.635 --> 01:16:38.628
- Hey, hey. Don't even think about it.
- You want to run away with me?

1181
01:16:39.055 --> 01:16:40.887
God, you're so desperate.

1182
01:16:40.973 --> 01:16:42.305
Hey, stop right... Elena!

1183
01:16:43.267 --> 01:16:46.055
- I want to live to see you again!
<i>- Elena, close the gate!</i>

1184
01:16:53.027 --> 01:16:54.027
Too late!

1185
01:17:02.578 --> 01:17:04.114
<i>Jane, where are you?!</i>

1186
01:17:04.205 --> 01:17:05.662
<i>The assassin's getting away!</i>

1187
01:17:21.639 --> 01:17:22.675
<i>Sabina!</i>

1188
01:17:27.311 --> 01:17:28.427
Who are you?

1189
01:17:31.357 --> 01:17:32.557
Elena, stop this thing!

1190
01:17:33.276 --> 01:17:34.276
No!

1191
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:38.278
Give me the case!

1192
01:17:46.664 --> 01:17:47.664
<i>Elena?</i>

1193
01:17:49.834 --> 01:17:51.541
- Hold on!
<i>- Elena!</i>

1194
01:17:53.963 --> 01:17:54.999
Elena!

1195
01:17:58.926 --> 01:18:00.462
Oh, God. Oh, no!

1196
01:18:03.473 --> 01:18:06.637
Come on. Elena? I need you, man! I need you!

1197
01:18:09.437 --> 01:18:11.224
Sabina, stay to the side!

1198
01:18:11.731 --> 01:18:12.731
Awesome!

1199
01:18:17.028 --> 01:18:19.065
Get me out of here!

1200
01:18:20.072 --> 01:18:21.072
Stop it!

1201
01:18:26.746 --> 01:18:27.782
Elena!

1202
01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:32.825
<i>It's about to get very crush-y in here!</i>

1203
01:18:35.671 --> 01:18:37.333
Jane, we need you!

1204
01:18:37.423 --> 01:18:38.584
I've nearly got it!

1205
01:18:38.674 --> 01:18:40.711
<i>Jane, hurry!</i>

1206
01:18:40.801 --> 01:18:41.837
<i>Jane!</i>

1207
01:18:50.019 --> 01:18:51.100
I'm on my way.

1208
01:18:53.981 --> 01:18:55.017
Sabina,

1209
01:18:55.107 --> 01:18:56.143
<i>reach up.</i>

1210
01:19:03.533 --> 01:19:05.866
Jane! Jane!

1211
01:19:05.952 --> 01:19:07.989
This one! This one! There!

1212
01:19:14.502 --> 01:19:15.788
Oh, thank God.

1213
01:19:23.803 --> 01:19:24.839
Oh, God.

1214
01:19:24.929 --> 01:19:28.343
- You all right, Sabina?!
- Yeah. Better late than never.

1215
01:19:38.609 --> 01:19:40.521
Oh, it's the wrong side.

1216
01:19:45.783 --> 01:19:47.991
Hey, did the rookie just tranq herself?

1217
01:19:48.077 --> 01:19:49.193
Yup.

1218
01:19:51.038 --> 01:19:52.745
Where's your boyfriend?

1219
01:19:52.832 --> 01:19:55.620
- Hodak. The assassin?
- Gone.

1220
01:19:56.127 --> 01:19:57.993
Took Calisto with him.

1221
01:19:58.087 --> 01:20:00.579
- Where's Jonny?
- He scurried off.

1222
01:20:00.673 --> 01:20:02.084
He's a little bitch.

1223
01:20:02.883 --> 01:20:04.294
Where's Boz?

1224
01:20:09.265 --> 01:20:12.178
We probably shouldn't be caught
standing over a dead body.

1225
01:20:12.268 --> 01:20:14.134
Not dressed like this, no.

1226
01:20:39.295 --> 01:20:40.661
Is she dead?

1227
01:20:42.757 --> 01:20:43.757
You want to touch her?

1228
01:20:45.843 --> 01:20:46.843
Come on.

1229
01:20:47.762 --> 01:20:48.762
Touch her.

1230
01:20:51.766 --> 01:20:53.473
She feels alive!

1231
01:20:54.393 --> 01:20:55.554
You woke her up.

1232
01:20:57.855 --> 01:20:58.855
Hey, you.

1233
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.226
Are we on a boat?

1234
01:21:02.818 --> 01:21:03.854
Yeah.

1235
01:21:04.987 --> 01:21:09.277
<i>♪ Love, it hurts
To be human ♪</i>

1236
01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:14.745
<i>♪ Without you I'd be losing ♪</i>

1237
01:21:15.623 --> 01:21:19.913
<i>♪ Girl, someday

1238
01:21:20.961 --> 01:21:25.251
<i>♪ Time, it hurts
To be human ♪♪</i>

1239
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:28.041
- Bosley!
- Boz?

1240
01:21:28.135 --> 01:21:29.342
Mrs. Bosley?

1241
01:21:35.685 --> 01:21:36.685
Boz.

1242
01:21:37.812 --> 01:21:39.428
Do Bosleys usually leave?

1243
01:21:40.815 --> 01:21:42.431
No, this is all wrong.

1244
01:21:43.776 --> 01:21:46.644
- So she's gone?
- Well, we were made,

1245
01:21:46.737 --> 01:21:48.353
so maybe she wanted to do a sweep.

1246
01:21:50.116 --> 01:21:51.277
Maybe.

1247
01:21:53.327 --> 01:21:54.659
Or she's...

1248
01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:01.041
What? No. Boz was the first Angel
to be promoted to Bosley.

1249
01:22:01.127 --> 01:22:04.370
- She's one of us.
- She would not be the first Angel to turn.

1250
01:22:04.463 --> 01:22:06.250
It's happened. You know the history.

1251
01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.582
It was her idea
to steal Calisto from the lab.

1252
01:22:08.676 --> 01:22:09.592
Exactly.

1253
01:22:09.593 --> 01:22:11.084
But Fleming beat her to it.

1254
01:22:11.554 --> 01:22:14.422
It's been our mission the entire time
to get this thing back,

1255
01:22:14.515 --> 01:22:16.507
and it just keeps slipping us, like...

1256
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.183
We're better than that. It's... It's her.

1257
01:22:20.187 --> 01:22:22.429
Fleming's dead. Calisto's gone.

1258
01:22:23.441 --> 01:22:24.441
And so is she.

1259
01:22:26.402 --> 01:22:28.394
Jonny said he represented somebody...

1260
01:22:28.863 --> 01:22:30.274
What if it's Boz?

1261
01:22:35.202 --> 01:22:36.202
That's my room.

1262
01:22:42.752 --> 01:22:43.752
Hello?

1263
01:22:44.044 --> 01:22:45.751
<i>Charlie sends love.</i>

1264
01:22:45.838 --> 01:22:46.874
You're in grave danger.

1265
01:22:46.964 --> 01:22:48.626
<i>- Get out of there now!</i>
- Guys?

1266
01:23:08.611 --> 01:23:09.611
Jane?

1267
01:23:24.084 --> 01:23:26.041
Elena, stay down! Stay down!

1268
01:23:26.128 --> 01:23:27.619
Elena, stay down! Stay down!

1269
01:23:36.931 --> 01:23:38.172
I'm Bosley.

1270
01:23:38.265 --> 01:23:40.552
Let's get you out of here.

1271
01:23:40.643 --> 01:23:42.054
Quickly.

1272
01:24:20.182 --> 01:24:21.182
Sabina?

1273
01:24:24.395 --> 01:24:25.511
Sabina.

1274
01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.480
Sabina.

1275
01:24:37.992 --> 01:24:39.779
Hey. Sabina.

1276
01:24:58.053 --> 01:24:59.715
She means a lot to you.

1277
01:25:00.931 --> 01:25:02.138
We're new friends.

1278
01:25:03.225 --> 01:25:04.386
I think.

1279
01:25:06.604 --> 01:25:09.312
It's been a really tough week.

1280
01:25:15.195 --> 01:25:16.811
I can't lose her too.

1281
01:25:30.586 --> 01:25:32.202
What are you doing?

1282
01:25:33.297 --> 01:25:35.163
- Oh, God.
- Ow.

1283
01:25:35.299 --> 01:25:36.756
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1284
01:25:36.842 --> 01:25:37.842
I'm so sorry.

1285
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:41.211
Why are you crying?

1286
01:25:43.349 --> 01:25:44.385
I'm not crying.

1287
01:25:45.893 --> 01:25:47.475
Well, you are. That's...

1288
01:25:47.561 --> 01:25:48.561
That's what's...

1289
01:25:50.981 --> 01:25:53.143
Okay, fine, yeah, I'm crying.

1290
01:25:54.735 --> 01:25:57.728
But I didn't think that you...

1291
01:25:57.821 --> 01:25:59.062
cared about me.

1292
01:25:59.156 --> 01:26:00.156
Why?

1293
01:26:01.075 --> 01:26:02.486
Because...

1294
01:26:02.576 --> 01:26:04.989
Because you don't think I have any feelings.

1295
01:26:05.079 --> 01:26:06.079
No, I...

1296
01:26:08.374 --> 01:26:10.582
I can be really annoying.

1297
01:26:11.251 --> 01:26:12.992
Most of the time.

1298
01:26:13.087 --> 01:26:15.249
You can be so annoying.

1299
01:26:15.339 --> 01:26:19.174
I don't try to be. It just sort of... I don't
have the filter thing that people have.

1300
01:26:22.805 --> 01:26:24.922
- Hey.
- I don't know what this is made of,

1301
01:26:25.015 --> 01:26:26.426
but it saved your life.

1302
01:26:27.851 --> 01:26:28.851
Thanks.

1303
01:26:30.104 --> 01:26:31.140
Where's Elena?

1304
01:26:31.647 --> 01:26:33.138
I don't know.

1305
01:26:33.232 --> 01:26:36.191
We have to find her,
so I called in for some help.

1306
01:26:36.819 --> 01:26:39.277
- Because I got blown up?
- Yeah.

1307
01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.527
But also because...

1308
01:26:43.617 --> 01:26:46.951
you convinced me
I don't have to do everything by myself.

1309
01:26:47.037 --> 01:26:48.073
Well done.

1310
01:26:49.915 --> 01:26:52.498
Hello, Angels. You owe me an explanation.

1311
01:26:54.128 --> 01:26:55.664
This is not Brazil.

1312
01:26:55.754 --> 01:26:58.087
- Hey.
- I brought supplies.

1313
01:26:58.173 --> 01:27:00.039
Homemade kombucha with probiotics.

1314
01:27:00.134 --> 01:27:01.750
And the best part...

1315
01:27:01.844 --> 01:27:03.426
I brought a friend.

1316
01:27:03.512 --> 01:27:04.548
- You.
- You trai...

1317
01:27:04.638 --> 01:27:05.845
- Hey!
- Jane.

1318
01:27:06.682 --> 01:27:07.682
I'm not the mole.

1319
01:27:07.766 --> 01:27:10.008
- Then why are you here?
- The same reason you are.

1320
01:27:10.936 --> 01:27:12.222
I should be dead.

1321
01:27:17.317 --> 01:27:19.309
She called me right after you did.

1322
01:27:19.403 --> 01:27:21.360
I have an herbal compress for the bruises.

1323
01:27:21.447 --> 01:27:24.315
- Nobody wants that.
- Okay. Keep your bruises.

1324
01:27:24.408 --> 01:27:25.408
So then who?

1325
01:27:27.453 --> 01:27:29.615
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

1326
01:27:32.124 --> 01:27:33.740
I had some clothes sent up.

1327
01:27:33.834 --> 01:27:35.166
Take your pick.

1328
01:27:40.007 --> 01:27:41.748
Why so formal?

1329
01:27:41.842 --> 01:27:44.880
I'm sorry, is this another headquarters?

1330
01:27:44.970 --> 01:27:47.508
Have you heard from Jane and Sabina?
Will they come?

1331
01:27:48.515 --> 01:27:50.472
So inquisitive.

1332
01:27:50.559 --> 01:27:52.516
Curiosity of a cat.

1333
01:27:52.603 --> 01:27:54.219
Or a ferret.

1334
01:27:54.313 --> 01:27:56.771
It's the scientist in you, isn't it?

1335
01:27:57.983 --> 01:28:00.316
Just trying to understand my situation.

1336
01:28:00.402 --> 01:28:04.316
You wanted an audience
with Mr. Brok to discuss Calisto.

1337
01:28:04.406 --> 01:28:06.398
Well, soon you'll have one.

1338
01:28:07.117 --> 01:28:09.359
But Calisto's been stolen now, so I...

1339
01:28:23.133 --> 01:28:24.294
Well done.

1340
01:28:26.678 --> 01:28:29.637
Satisfying when a plan comes together.

1341
01:28:29.723 --> 01:28:32.511
We'll give you some privacy.

1342
01:28:33.602 --> 01:28:34.602
Oh, my...

1343
01:28:38.899 --> 01:28:41.312
- No way.
- Oh, yes.

1344
01:28:41.401 --> 01:28:42.812
I've been tracking him for weeks.

1345
01:28:42.903 --> 01:28:44.314
<i>When he landed in Istanbul,</i>

1346
01:28:44.404 --> 01:28:47.112
<i>I knew I needed to get to him
before he got to you.</i>

1347
01:28:47.825 --> 01:28:50.363
<i>Boz, they are leaving. Go, no-go?</i>

1348
01:28:52.955 --> 01:28:53.955
<i>Boz.</i>

1349
01:28:54.414 --> 01:28:55.621
Damn it!

1350
01:28:55.707 --> 01:28:58.074
I'm sorry I left the quarry but...

1351
01:28:58.168 --> 01:29:00.080
more sorry I was too late.

1352
01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:02.378
I just can't believe that.

1353
01:29:02.464 --> 01:29:04.046
A Bosley?

1354
01:29:04.133 --> 01:29:07.251
- You had no trouble believing it was me.
- You heard that?

1355
01:29:07.678 --> 01:29:09.385
- Mm.
- Australian Jonny.

1356
01:29:10.389 --> 01:29:13.632
- The one that got away.
- Yeah, again.

1357
01:29:13.725 --> 01:29:15.057
The last time we saw him,

1358
01:29:15.144 --> 01:29:17.602
- we were in Rio, and then...
- You pushed me off a roof.

1359
01:29:17.688 --> 01:29:19.771
- You have got to get over that.
- Oh, my God.

1360
01:29:19.857 --> 01:29:22.440
I am. Just processing.

1361
01:29:22.526 --> 01:29:24.734
So then the last person to see him was...

1362
01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.436
- Was Bosley.
- Exactly.

1363
01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:29.989
When Jonny didn't make it jo jail,
Charlie suspected Bosley had gone rogue.

1364
01:29:30.075 --> 01:29:34.490
It turns out he's building his own network,
selling his services to the highest bidders.

1365
01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:36.321
So he's using us to date criminals now?

1366
01:29:36.415 --> 01:29:41.331
Yeah. Jonny, Mr. Hodak, that assassin,
they work for Bosley.

1367
01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.036
He always seemed like a weirdo.

1368
01:29:43.922 --> 01:29:45.788
Freaky. English.

1369
01:29:47.217 --> 01:29:49.334
- So Bosley has Elena.
- Mm-hm.

1370
01:29:49.428 --> 01:29:51.156
- Do we know where?
- Of course we know.

1371
01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:53.888
There's trackers in most of the clothes.

1372
01:29:53.974 --> 01:29:56.557
You have a lot of leather jackets
at your apartment.

1373
01:29:56.643 --> 01:29:59.681
- See, I told you it was borrow and not take.
- Shh.

1374
01:29:59.813 --> 01:30:03.352
Alexander Brok is hosting a party
at his compound. Elena's there.

1375
01:30:06.278 --> 01:30:07.196
<i>Every year,</i>

1376
01:30:07.197 --> 01:30:10.315
<i>he brings together the wealthy and beautiful
for his annual Vision Party.</i>

1377
01:30:11.658 --> 01:30:14.742
<i>This year, he's planning
to present Calisto to his investors.</i>

1378
01:30:14.828 --> 01:30:17.036
Why would Bosley want to take Elena to Brok?

1379
01:30:18.415 --> 01:30:20.702
Bringing the Birdman
back to Alcatraz, I guess.

1380
01:30:21.793 --> 01:30:23.079
The who?

1381
01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:26.333
It's a movie. Burt Lancaster.

1382
01:30:26.715 --> 01:30:28.377
<i>Birdman</i>. Michael Keaton.

1383
01:30:28.467 --> 01:30:31.460
- No, Michael Keaton is Batman.
- No, Ben Affleck is Batman.

1384
01:30:31.553 --> 01:30:32.714
I mean, is he?

1385
01:30:33.889 --> 01:30:36.367
Am I really the only person here
who knows who Burt Lancaster is?

1386
01:30:36.391 --> 01:30:38.007
- I'm concussed.
- It doesn't matter.

1387
01:30:38.101 --> 01:30:40.184
- It's an old movie. It's from...
- How old are you?

1388
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:42.683
How old am I? What?
That has nothing to do with it.

1389
01:30:42.773 --> 01:30:45.811
- I don't have your references.
- There are film buffs of all ages.

1390
01:30:45.901 --> 01:30:47.483
Let's go get our girl.

1391
01:30:53.492 --> 01:30:54.983
What do you want with me?

1392
01:31:12.719 --> 01:31:15.086
Did you raid your mom's closet for this?

1393
01:31:16.515 --> 01:31:18.381
What else of hers do you play with?

1394
01:31:26.358 --> 01:31:31.023
I've spent an entire career
estimating the talents of women.

1395
01:31:31.113 --> 01:31:33.070
And you, my dear,

1396
01:31:34.283 --> 01:31:36.741
are marvelously clever.

1397
01:31:37.828 --> 01:31:39.160
You betrayed them.

1398
01:31:39.246 --> 01:31:41.078
You betrayed the Angels.

1399
01:31:41.164 --> 01:31:44.077
Well, I no longer work
for the Townsend Agency.

1400
01:31:44.167 --> 01:31:47.126
I was retired.

1401
01:31:47.212 --> 01:31:51.252
So you are going to show me

1402
01:31:51.341 --> 01:31:54.925
how to hack this
and reprogram root access...

1403
01:31:55.929 --> 01:31:56.929
to me.

1404
01:31:58.056 --> 01:31:59.968
You thought Fleming could do it.

1405
01:32:00.058 --> 01:32:03.267
He always had a habit of claiming credit
he didn't deserve.

1406
01:32:03.353 --> 01:32:06.517
- How long will it take?
- Forever. I'm not touching it.

1407
01:32:08.483 --> 01:32:10.941
Ha, ha. You think you have a choice.

1408
01:32:11.028 --> 01:32:12.610
It's adorable.

1409
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:15.192
They'll send... They'll send love.

1410
01:32:18.535 --> 01:32:20.618
They'll send love.

1411
01:32:22.372 --> 01:32:25.581
Ohh. Feisty. You've been studying.

1412
01:32:28.503 --> 01:32:30.460

1439
01:34:24.703 --> 01:34:26.865
I'm just really turned around.
This place is huge.

1440
01:34:26.955 --> 01:34:28.537
I was looking for the bathroom.

1441
01:34:28.623 --> 01:34:30.660
It's just that I really need to pee.

1442
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:33.288
Am I in the wrong place? I thought may...

1443
01:34:36.131 --> 01:34:37.417
Sweet dreams.

1444
01:34:39.426 --> 01:34:40.426
We're in.

1445
01:34:41.761 --> 01:34:43.172
Why are you doing this?

1446
01:34:43.263 --> 01:34:46.927
To neutralize an enemy discreetly
and anonymously.

1447
01:34:47.017 --> 01:34:49.350
That's a gold standard in my business.

1448
01:34:49.436 --> 01:34:52.349
What you deem a flaw, I deem a gift.

1449
01:34:52.439 --> 01:34:55.853
One that not only provides power...

1450
01:34:56.693 --> 01:34:58.400
but confers it as well.

1451
01:35:01.406 --> 01:35:04.319
- Whoa. What are you doing in my office?
- Mr. Brok? Oh, my God.

1452
01:35:04.409 --> 01:35:05.570
Thank God. Please help me.

1453
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.420
- What is she doing here?
- These men...

1454
01:35:11.249 --> 01:35:14.492
John, I'm a little confused.
I thought you handled her.

1455
01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:16.501
Handled me?

1456
01:35:19.424 --> 01:35:20.585
It was you?

1457
01:35:20.675 --> 01:35:22.917
You wanted to sabotage me.

1458
01:35:23.011 --> 01:35:26.971
What were you expecting, flowers?
A handwritten thank-you note?

1459
01:35:29.601 --> 01:35:30.967
Get rid of her already.

1460
01:35:31.061 --> 01:35:34.475
Actually,
I believe that she can still prove useful.

1461
01:35:34.564 --> 01:35:39.650
- Do you even know who he is?
- Yes. My global security chief.

1462
01:35:40.737 --> 01:35:43.480
John's just recovered Calisto
from Peter Fleming,

1463
01:35:43.573 --> 01:35:45.314
that shortsighted, greedy traitor.

1464
01:35:45.408 --> 01:35:48.526
- They killed him. They killed Fleming.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1465
01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.620
La-la-la!

1466
01:35:49.704 --> 01:35:54.324
See, this is the problem with you, right?
You keep telling me shit I can't know.

1467
01:35:54.417 --> 01:35:56.579
Plausible deniability. You ever heard of it?

1468
01:35:57.504 --> 01:35:58.961
You're a terrible employee.

1469
01:35:59.047 --> 01:36:00.959
Yeah, and who cares if people die, right?

1470
01:36:01.049 --> 01:36:03.883
- As long as the investors are happy.
- Grow up, little girl.

1471
01:36:03.969 --> 01:36:06.256
Calisto is about to change the world.

1472
01:36:06.346 --> 01:36:10.056
Right, if you want to bake a cake,
you got to break a few eggs.

1473
01:36:10.141 --> 01:36:11.141
It's omelet.

1474
01:36:11.184 --> 01:36:14.624
If you're gonna compare dead people to eggs,
could you at least use the correct phrase?

1475
01:36:15.313 --> 01:36:18.681
I shouldn't be here.
You're a security threat.

1476
01:36:18.775 --> 01:36:21.233
You take care of her
and finish what you started.

1477
01:36:21.319 --> 01:36:22.855
That's exactly the plan.

1478
01:36:26.157 --> 01:36:28.149
Excuse me. I have a party to host.

1479
01:36:29.452 --> 01:36:33.446
- Yo, Tats, move.
- Take a seat, Mr. Brok.

1480
01:36:35.208 --> 01:36:36.699
Uh, no.

1481
01:36:36.793 --> 01:36:39.536
Sorry, what the hell's happening here?

1482
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:41.996
Oh, my God.

1483
01:36:42.090 --> 01:36:43.297
Let me out now.

1484
01:36:47.262 --> 01:36:49.049
Sorry, you work for me.

1485
01:36:49.139 --> 01:36:52.052
All right, all of you work for me!

1486
01:36:54.227 --> 01:36:55.513
You dumbass.

1487
01:36:55.604 --> 01:36:57.220
Why are you laughing?

1488
01:36:57.314 --> 01:36:59.021
You idiot.

1489
01:36:59.107 --> 01:37:01.474
They're stealing Calisto from you.

1490
01:37:01.568 --> 01:37:05.278
They're gonna use it as a weapon.
To assassinate people.

1491
01:37:30.555 --> 01:37:32.638
- That ought to do it.
- I think so.

1492
01:37:34.434 --> 01:37:38.178
If you would grant root access,
please, Mr. Brok.

1493
01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:39.682
You're crazy. Ha, ha.

1494
01:37:39.773 --> 01:37:41.935
I'm not giving you my access.

1495
01:37:42.025 --> 01:37:43.687
You could alter the blockchain.

1496
01:37:43.777 --> 01:37:46.815
You could ruin it.
You could literally ruin everything.

1497
01:37:49.282 --> 01:37:54.448
Our intention is for Calisto to be released
into the market as planned.

1498
01:37:54.954 --> 01:37:59.198
In fact, the more units there are out there
for me to hack into, the better.

1499
01:37:59.292 --> 01:38:03.457
Don't do it. They've killed everyone
who knows about this except you and me.

1500
01:38:03.546 --> 01:38:07.836
Mr. Brok is complicit
in the deaths of two people.

1501
01:38:07.926 --> 01:38:10.168
Now, I am very happy

1502
01:38:10.261 --> 01:38:13.379
to inform my former colleagues
in law enforcement.

No override.

1551
01:40:56.886 --> 01:40:59.094

1552
01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:01.046

01:41:04.519 --> 01:41:08.058
We're gonna be downstairs
enjoying your party. Come on.

1555
01:41:08.147 --> 01:41:11.686
You want me to go back down there
and just pretend everything's fine?

1556
01:41:11.776 --> 01:41:13.187
Everything is fine.

1557
01:41:13.278 --> 01:41:16.988
You're gonna disrupt the power industry!

1558
01:41:17.073 --> 01:41:18.564
Go, you.

1559
01:41:18.658 --> 01:41:22.072
You know,
retirement is better than I expected.

1560
01:41:30.795 --> 01:41:32.036
I'm so sorry, Langston.

1561
01:41:32.130 --> 01:41:33.416
Oh, God.

1562
01:41:35.008 --> 01:41:36.499
That guy is a total dick.

1563
01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:48.143
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, girl, I got you.

1564
01:41:48.855 --> 01:41:50.266
Of course I got it.

1565
01:41:53.693 --> 01:41:55.480
Have fun, guys.

1566
01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:56.570
See ya!

1567
01:42:01.993 --> 01:42:03.734
- Beep, beep. Excuse me.
- Hey.

1568
01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.249
This is your party, Alex. Enjoy it.

1569
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:15.246
The world is on fire, Alex.

1570
01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:18.458
But I'm sure
your generation is gonna figure it out.

1571
01:42:22.597 --> 01:42:26.637
- Hey, help us!
- There must be a key here somewhere.

1572
01:42:28.853 --> 01:42:33.188
You see, it was my mentor, Edgar,
who taught me how to win a fight.

1573
01:42:33.274 --> 01:42:36.767
You thought you beat me twice before? No.

1574
01:42:36.861 --> 01:42:37.942
I was learning.

1575
01:43:02.303 --> 01:43:04.420
You've got seven moves, Mr. Hodak.

1576
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:12.515
I know them all.

1577
01:43:32.083 --> 01:43:33.915
Seven moves...

1578
01:43:34.002 --> 01:43:35.163
and a fragile ego.

1579
01:43:44.262 --> 01:43:46.879
Why is this happening?!

1580
01:43:59.777 --> 01:44:02.144
- Got her.
<i>- Good job.</i>

1581
01:44:03.322 --> 01:44:05.314
- Yes!
- Sabina! Oh, my God.

1582
01:44:05.408 --> 01:44:07.274
- You came for me.
- Look at you.

1583
01:44:08.286 --> 01:44:10.073
- Why is that thing doing that?
- Oh, that?

1584
01:44:10.163 --> 01:44:12.951
That's nothing. I just programmed it
to light up and make noises.

1585
01:44:15.209 --> 01:44:16.450
You two, with me.

1586
01:44:18.504 --> 01:44:20.983
- Directly to the exit, please.
- Get this man help. Please.

1587
01:44:21.007 --> 01:44:22.109
- Calm down.
- Please.

1588
01:44:22.133 --> 01:44:24.625
Get out. Everybody go.

1589
01:44:24.719 --> 01:44:26.301
Just get out.

1590
01:44:31.225 --> 01:44:33.467
Do you really think you'd kill me,
old badger?

1591
01:44:33.561 --> 01:44:35.974
You know, Rebecca, I really did.

1592
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:40.186
My name is Bosley,

1593
01:44:40.276 --> 01:44:41.733
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

1594
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:48.733
You expect me to go quietly after 40 years?

1595
01:44:51.621 --> 01:44:52.907
This is what I do.

1596
01:45:08.096 --> 01:45:09.632
You're outmanned, Angel.

1597
01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.006
You always have been.

1598
01:45:14.769 --> 01:45:15.769
Kill her.

1599
01:45:19.273 --> 01:45:20.389
Send the love.

1600
01:45:53.349 --> 01:45:54.349
Ingrid?

1601
01:46:10.491 --> 01:46:11.902
You've been busy.

1602
01:46:12.285 --> 01:46:13.742
How did you...?

1603
01:46:14.745 --> 01:46:16.031
It's just business, John.

1604
01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:21.208
He's with me now.

1605
01:46:21.294 --> 01:46:23.160
I see.

1606
01:46:23.254 --> 01:46:27.214
You know,
I built this agency from the ground up.

1607
01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:30.338
It was supposed to be mine
after Charlie died.

1608
01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:32.632
I was pushed out.

1609
01:46:33.222 --> 01:46:37.341
What did you expect me to do?
Take up gardening?

1610
01:46:37.935 --> 01:46:40.894
You thought you made us. We made you.

1611
01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:43.313
- Yeah, we trusted you, you dick.
- Good nigh...

1612
01:46:44.483 --> 01:46:47.271
- I was right in the middle of my speech.
- Sorry.

1613
01:46:48.613 --> 01:46:49.729
All right, well...

1614
01:46:49.822 --> 01:46:52.485
Sweep it clean, Angels. Good job.

1615
01:46:59.832 --> 01:47:03.041
So you want to go to California
and train to be an Angel?

1616
01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:05.661
What? I...

1617
01:47:05.755 --> 01:47:07.712
Really? You...

1618
01:47:11.928 --> 01:47:12.844
Oh, my God.

1619
01:47:12.845 --> 01:47:15.838
- We are recruiting you.
- To be an Angel like...

1620
01:47:15.932 --> 01:47:17.389
- you and Jane?
- Let's go.

1621
01:47:17.475 --> 01:47:19.512
What do you think we've been doing?

1622
01:47:19.602 --> 01:47:20.718
I don't know.

1623
01:47:20.811 --> 01:47:24.100
I thought you were smart.
Isn't that your thing?

1624
01:47:24.190 --> 01:47:25.476
<i>It's done, Charlie.</i>

1625
01:47:25.566 --> 01:47:28.434
<i>And I decided what to do
with Elena Houghlin.</i>

1626
01:47:28.527 --> 01:47:30.422
<i>- What's that?
- She's our new recruit.</i>

1627
01:47:30.446 --> 01:47:33.359
- Good. Thank you, Boz.
<i>- Good. Thank you, Boz.</i>

1628
01:47:33.449 --> 01:47:35.862
- I appreciate the call.
<i>- I appreciate the call.</i>

1629
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:41.329
- What do you guys do in California?
- Have you ever jumped out of an airplane?

1630
01:47:41.415 --> 01:47:42.747
- I don't really do heights.
- Oh.

1631
01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:45.451
Have you swam with sharks?

1632
01:47:45.544 --> 01:47:47.397
- Hey! It's you.
- How long can you hold your breath?

1633
01:47:47.421 --> 01:47:49.504
Sharks? Not long.

1634
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:50.548
Oh, hey.

1635
01:47:50.549 --> 01:47:52.916
- Hi.
- What happened to you?

1636
01:47:53.010 --> 01:47:54.672
Wait, you guys know each other?

1637
01:47:55.388 --> 01:47:57.596
- Yeah, I was eating a sandwich.
- Yeah.

1638
01:47:57.682 --> 01:47:59.969
- I came in, and you gave me the...
- The phosphorus.

1639
01:48:00.059 --> 01:48:01.550
Yeah, that's my favorite chemical.

1640
01:48:01.644 --> 01:48:04.057
- Because you were...
- Yeah, exactly, mixed with...

1641
01:48:05.815 --> 01:48:07.181
Did you...?

1642
01:48:07.275 --> 01:48:08.391
Did you do that?

1643
01:48:09.694 --> 01:48:11.902
Oh... Yeah.

1644
01:48:11.988 --> 01:48:15.072
I think he finally got the point.

1645
01:48:15.157 --> 01:48:18.025
Is that a pun? Because you impaled him?

1646
01:48:18.119 --> 01:48:22.739
Are you doing, like,
a joke thing for the handsome nerd?

1647
01:48:22.832 --> 01:48:23.913
Of course not.

1648
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.788
I mean, it's working,
if that is what you're doing.

1649
01:48:27.545 --> 01:48:29.628
So if I'm trying to get in touch with you,

1650
01:48:29.714 --> 01:48:33.082
- how would I do that?
- Oh, don't worry. I'll find you.
