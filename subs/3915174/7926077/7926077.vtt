So many cats! (screams)

550
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.728
Amateurs.

551
00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:47.665
- I'll be outside.

better than you.

GOLDI:
That's a dog in a cat costume.

556
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.800
- (chuckles)
- Oh, yeah.

557
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.426
Tricky little bugger.

558
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.285
How about this one?
He's a ginger.

Is that a joke?

561
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:07.268
You think this scruffy,
geriatric bag of bones

562
00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.937
looks like a legend?

563
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.438
This is definitely not...

564
00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:12.714
BABY:
Puss in Boots! I found him!

565
00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:16.820
Puss in Boots, dead and buried.

566
00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:18.947
- Dead? No, no, no, he can't be.
- (sniffing)

567
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:21.699
Yep. The nose never lies.

568
00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:23.451
Well, that's that, then.

569
00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:25.119
What say we go
and hibernate, huh?

570
00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.454
- No.
- Ow!

571
00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.122
The map is being
delivered tonight,

572
00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.041
and we have one chance
to steal it.

573
00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:32.335
Without it, we'll never find
the Wishing Star.

574
00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:34.170
The Wishing Star.

575
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:35.839
It does exist.

576
00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:38.132
That star has one wish to grant.

577
00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.509
One wish?

578
00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:41.553
Think of what
that could mean for us.

579
00:27:41.577 --> 00:27:43.763
Nine lives. Yes!

580
00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:45.640
Well, I don't see
why we needed to hire

581
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.225
Puss in Boots
in the first place.

582
00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:51.229
Ugh. Because nobody steals
from Big Jack Horner.

583
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:53.189
No! Not Jack Horner.

584
00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:56.401
Don't worry, love.
We'll get that wish somehow.

585
00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:57.735
Thank you, Mama.

586
00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:00.154
Yeah, because I've got a plan.

587
00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.574
I can nick a map
as good as any old cat.

588
00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:04.158
(laughs)

589
00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.035
You've got a plan?

590
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.246
What? I'm smart, ain't I?
Ain't I, Papa?

591
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.833
PAPA: No, you ain't
well-fixed for brains.

592
00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:15.587
Robbing Big Jack Horner...
Very risky.

593
00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:18.673
But that wish could get me
my lives back.

594
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.675
And my life back.

595
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:22.510
Goodbye, Pickles!

596
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.012
Oh, no, Pickles, you're leaving?

597
00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:26.139
Perro, start digging.

598
00:28:26.163 --> 00:28:27.807
Okay.

599
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.975
But if this Puss in Boots
is such a big deal,

600
00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:31.769
maybe we shouldn't be
desecrating his grave.

601
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:36.131
No, I don't think he would mind,
because he...

602
00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.361
...is me!

603
00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:43.531
Oh. O-Okay.

604
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.408
Oh, yeah. Uh... (clears throat)

605
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.035
Normally, I have a sword.

607
00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:50.747
Pickles, you're Puss in Boots?

Not yet, but I will be.

It wasn't a fairy tale!

It's distinguished.

722
00:33:48.652 --> 00:33:51.380
(deep creaking)

723
00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:53.448
(screaming)

724
00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:56.385
(wheezing)

725
00:33:56.409 --> 00:34:00.622
Great plan, Baby. Real catlike.

726
00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:08.689
Uh, can I go?

727
00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.757
Pleasure doing, uh...

728
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:15.363
- Puss in Boots?
- Goldi. Bears.

729
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:18.032
- Hola, Jack.
- Kitty Softpaws.

730
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:21.410
My, you have a lot of nerve
coming back here.

731
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.913
Please. I was the best thief
you ever hired.

732
00:34:23.937 --> 00:34:25.706
- You robbed me.
- You set me up.

733
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.876
You said you were going
on some spiritual retreat.

734
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.044
Namaste.

735
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.796
And you're supposed to be dead.

736
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.089
I got better?

737
00:34:33.113 --> 00:34:34.382
Ugh. Just give us the map.

738
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:36.050
- And throw in a dozen pies.
- Eh?

739
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:37.426
Ooh. Have you got
any savory pies?

740
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.262
- What? N-No.
- Yeah, what flavors you got?

741
00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:40.888
MAMA: Can we get all of that
in a bag to go?

742
00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:44.100
Oh, would you stop talking
about blooming pies? Focus!

743
00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:45.893
- (high-pitched screaming)
- Hand over that map,

744
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.812
or I'll punch holes
in the lot of ya.

745
00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:49.105
(creaking)

746
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:52.382
- Oh, bums.
- Look out! It's coming down!

747
00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:56.904
PUSS: Ha!

748
00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:01.117
I hate talking
fairy tale animals!

749
00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:03.226
(screaming)

750
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.747
- (laughs)
- What? Get back here!

751
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.457
The best thief has won.

752
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.126
- Huh?
- KITTY: You're right.

753
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.169
- (Puss groans)
- She did.

754
00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:13.296
Oh, come on!

755
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.422
- (yells)
- (roaring)

756
00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:16.590
There. They're getting away.

757
00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:19.117
♪ ♪

758
00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:22.096

759
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.932

No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

762
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.940
Nice catching up with you, Puss.

763
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.841
Got to go.

764
00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:38.261
Here, kitty, kitty.

765
00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:41.907
Is that a stick? What are you
gonna do with that...

766
00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:44.225
- Ow!
- Ow! Me knuckles!

767
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.787
You shouldn't have
done that, mate.

768

770
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:51.441
This idiot.

771
00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.966
Hey, Puss.
I found a sandwich in here.

772
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.134
I think it's tuna fish.

773
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.385
- Drive, perro!
- Okey doke.

774
00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:03.536
- (neighing)
- (henchmen shouting)

775
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.146
Oh, cool.
Another member of the team.

776
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.272
BOTH: We are not a team.

777
00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.815
- Eyes on the road!
- Whoa!

778
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.067
Who is this guy?

779
00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:18.069
- I'm Puss's best friend.
- No, he isn't.

780
00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:19.278
And his therapy dog.

781
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:20.780
Definitely not.

782
00:36:20.804 --> 00:36:23.181
Finally. You need therapy.

783
00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.495
Give me the map. Trust me.

784
00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:30.706
Trust you?
Like I did in Santa Coloma?

785
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.957
Really? Santa Coloma?

786
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:34.192
Sí, Santa Coloma.

787
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.714
- Mine!
- Mine!

788
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:40.049
- (screeches): Mine!
- (screeches): Mine!

789
00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:42.367
(both screeching, hissing)

790
00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:46.413
(both blow, growl)

791
00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:48.832
Hyah!

792
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.211
(gasping, cheering)

793
00:36:54.546 --> 00:36:55.689
(neighing)

794
00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.359
Good people,
accept this golden gift

795
00:36:58.383 --> 00:37:00.861
from Puss in Boots!

796
00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:02.387
(cheering)

797
00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:06.224
(wolf whistling)

798
00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.358
- Speed up! Go, go, go!
- (yells)

799
00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:22.240
Assemble the Baker's Dozen.

800
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.052
- Careful with this.
- (yells)

801
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:27.304
I'll take this and that.

802
00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:28.722
Oh, and these. One of those.

803
00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:31.100
And I got to take that.
Yes. Yes.

804
00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:34.228
No. Yes! Oh, yeah!

805
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:36.504
(humming a jolly tune)

806
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:39.066
All of these!

807
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.260
(chuckles) This one is right.

808
00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:44.929
(bowling pins crashing)

809
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.267
(yells)

810
00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:54.415
- (horses neighing)
- (yelling)

811
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:59.652
I'll get you, my kitties,
and your little dog, too.

812
00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:02.655
(panting)

813
00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.761
What? This is blank.

814
00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.431
We've been ripped off!
Where is the...

815
00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:13.434
Oh. Yeah.
I knew it was gonna do that.

816
00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:16.270
"The Dark Forest
is deep and far.

817
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:19.231
Within its bounds,
you'll find the star."

818
00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:21.692
(sighs) The Dark Forest?

819
00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:24.153
No one goes
into the Dark Forest.

820
00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:25.863
Or comes out.

821
00:38:25.887 --> 00:38:28.532
KITTY: "A single wish
burns true and bright.

822
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:31.768
This map's the key,
so hold on tight."

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.497
(grunts) Suéltalo.

824
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:36.665
- You let go.
- A stick?

825
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:39.126
(chuckles)
What happened to your sword?

826
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.419
Got rid of it, you know.

827
00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:41.962
Made things too easy.

828
00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.464
I needed a challenge.

829
00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:45.925
Yeah, you looked
pretty challenged back there.

830
00:38:45.949 --> 00:38:47.343
(chuckles)

831
00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:49.136
There's no way I'm letting you
hold the map.

832
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.347
Well, there's no way
I'm letting you hold the map.

833
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:53.665
- I can hold it.
- (whip cracking sound effects)

834
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:56.644
Yeah, right.
What's your deal, anyway?

835
00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:58.479
You run with the Chihuahua Gang?

836
00:38:58.503 --> 00:38:59.730
I don't think so.

837
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:01.524
- I don't believe you.
- That's okay.

838
00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:03.859
As long as you believe
in yourself.

839
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:05.194
Wha...

840
00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:07.404
Is he deranged?

841
00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:09.240
- Yep.
- What's your name?

842
00:39:09.264 --> 00:39:11.408
Oh, I've been called
all kinds of things.

843
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:13.077
Dog, Bad Dog, Stupid Dog.

844
00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:16.163
Hey You! You There! Get Out!
Leave It! Drop It!

Butt Nugget, (bleep) for Brains.

847
00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:21.627
You know, that sort of thing.

848
00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:24.338
But I've never had a name
that really stuck, you know?

849
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.298
That belonged to me.

850
00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:28.884
- Is he done?
- And you are?

851
00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.219
Softpaws.

852
00:39:30.243 --> 00:39:31.720
Kitty Softpaws.

853
00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:34.223
Wow. Yeah.
Now, that's a good name.

854
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:35.975
There's music
in a name like that.

855
00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:38.435
Kitty Softpaws.

856
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:41.355
Nice try. Classic con.

857
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:43.983
No one's that dumb.
No one's that nice.

858
00:39:44.007 --> 00:39:45.317
I don't trust you.

859
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.528
Me, neither.
He cannot be trusted.

860
00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:50.823
But I trust him
more than I trust you.

861
00:39:50.847 --> 00:39:54.017
PUSS: Wow.
This trip is going to be fun.

Dog? Still alive?

- Whoa.
- Wow.

881
00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:20.829
For a Dark Forest,
this place is pretty colorful.

882
00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:22.956
I wish I had
my quinceañera here.

883
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.126
The Wishing Star is
in here somewhere.

884
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.046
Kitty, may I please see the map?

885
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.464
- No.
- Seriously!

886
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:32.800
You won't let me hold it
for even one minute?

887
00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:34.843
Nope. Not even for one second.

888
00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:39.205
Come on, Kitty.
You've got to trust me.

889
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:42.685
Wait. Wh-Wh-What's...
What's going on with his eyes?

890
00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:45.145
Oh, they're getting bigger.

891
00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.523
Oh, Kitty!

892
00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:49.650
You got to trust him.
Look at those eyes.

893
00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:52.027
Really? You call that cute?

Oh, look at her!

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.325
Those eyes are even bigger
than yours.

897
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.576
Do whatever she wants, Puss.

- No. With the paws?

over Undertaker Ridge,

912
00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:53.005
through the Cave of Lost Souls?

913

Swamp of Infinite Sorrows?

917
00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:14.693
Mountains of Misery?

918
00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:17.029
The Abyss of Eternal Loneliness?

919
00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:19.281
There's something wrong
with this map.

920
00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:21.784
I guess there is a different
terrible path for everyone.

921

to make a wish.

923

Well, I don't even have a wish,
but can I try?

- Huh?

Oh, but no. This is your quest.

944
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:17.172
it will make everything
just right for all of us.

945
00:44:17.196 --> 00:44:18.966

1013

Back when I was a pup,

1014

me and my littermates lived
with a family.

1015
00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:46.446
A family full of pranksters
who liked to play hide-and-seek,

1016
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.948
and I was always it.

1017
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:50.200
Pick on the little guy,
am I right? (sniffs)

1018
00:46:50.224 --> 00:46:53.245
They tried putting me in
a packing crate, a dumpster.

1019
00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:56.748
No matter how hard they tried,
I'd always find them.

1020
00:46:56.772 --> 00:46:59.167
So, one day, they get creative

1021
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:02.379
and they put me in a sock
with a rock in it.

1022

1023
00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:06.466
And then throw me in a river.

1024
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.136
I gnawed a hole in the sock,

1025
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.097
and I swam to the surface.

1026
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:14.641
Never found them
or my littermates.

1073
00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:12.449
Ha! Pay dirt.

1074
00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:16.346
All right, magical locust,
defoliate.

1075
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:17.681
Fly and feast.

1076
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.183
Eat those flowers.

1077
00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:22.602
I-I'm not a magic locust.

1078
00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.646
Why, I'm not a locust at all.

1079
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.023
What are you, then?
Some sort of demon grasshopper?

1080
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:28.775
- A deadly fairy?
- (screaming)

1081
00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.485
Put a spell on the forest, then.

1082
00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:31.987
I-I don't cast spells.

1083
00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:34.614
- Well, what do you do?
- Well, I-I-I judge you.

1084
00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:38.118
I sit on your shoulder
and judge your actions

1085
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.120
and the quality
of your character.

1086
00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:41.788
I'm your conscience.

1087
00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.290
I really did overpack.

1088
00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:45.000
- (screams)
- JACK HORNER: Whoa!

1089
00:49:45.024 --> 00:49:46.918
Help me, Jack! Help!

1090
00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.795
Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?

1091
00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.338
You're losing a lot of men.

1092
00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:52.340
I'm not really stressing
about the manpower.

1093
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:55.969
I've got a bottomless bag
of magic weapons.

1094
00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:57.888
These babies are gonna
get me that wish

1095
00:49:57.912 --> 00:50:00.891
even after the whole team
is dead and gone.

1096
00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:02.975
Now, now, Jack,
as your conscience, I...

1097
00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.769
- (squawks)
- Oh, my word!

1098
00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:06.396
It's the noble phoenix.

1099
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.065
She's the symbol of rebirth
and the eternal...

1100
00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:10.734
- (flame whooshing)
- Oh!

1101
00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:11.943
(laughing)

1102
00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:14.654
Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

1103
00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:18.283
I really have my work
cut out for me on this one.

1104
00:50:18.307 --> 00:50:22.353
JACK HORNER: Don't be near
where I'm flame-throwing.

1105
00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:29.002
(Puss chuckles)

1106
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:31.713
PUSS:
Do your job, demon flowers.

1107
00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:33.364
Soon.

1108
00:50:36.075 --> 00:50:37.427
(groans)

1109
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:39.387
Okay, Kitty,
I think I've got it now.

1110
00:50:39.411 --> 00:50:41.181
(straining)

1111
00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:43.516
- Trust me! (whimpers)
- KITTY: Easy, easy.

1112
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.518
You're gonna give yourself
a hernia.

1113
00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.812
Here, one more time. Like this.

1114
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:50.357
(echoing): Trust me.

1115
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:52.859
Aw. But of course
I trust you and Puss,

1116
00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.527
even without the eyes.

1117
00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.529
Yeah? Big mistake.

1118
00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:58.240
What do you mean?
You're my friends.

1119
00:50:58.264 --> 00:51:00.200
You know what trust gets you?

1120
00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:03.328
A sock, a rock
and a swim in the river.

1121
00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:05.121
You have to trust
somebody, right?

1122
00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:06.706
Not me. Uh-uh.

1123
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.333
Whenever I've let my guard down,

1124
00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:11.777
I've been double-crossed,
declawed, played and betrayed.

1125
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:14.714
Never again.

1126
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.174
I am a solo act.

1127
00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:19.552
I keep my secrets,
and I play my cards close.

1128
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:22.138
That's how you get
a winning hand.

1129
00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:23.723
Take it from me.

1130
00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.291
Never trust anyone.

1131
00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.397
W-Wait.

1132
00:51:30.421 --> 00:51:33.024
That's amazing. (gasps)

1133
00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:34.442
You're good.

1134
00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:37.070
(clears throat)
Kitty, I've been thinking.

1135
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:39.114
Ugh, thinking about what?

1136
00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:41.032
My beautiful beard.

1137
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.784
It is very distinguished, yes,

1138
00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:48.331
but it does deprive the world
a good look at, uh, the face.

1139
00:51:48.355 --> 00:51:53.295
So, if it will make you happy,
I could be convinced to...

1140
00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:54.879
- I've gotten used to it.
- Wait, what?

1141
00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:56.464
The beard... keep it.

1142
00:51:56.488 --> 00:52:00.176
Uh, well, you see, uh...
(chuckles, sobs)

1143
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.762
Kitty, please,
get this itchy thing off of me!

1144
00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.723
It's like a fever on my face!

1145
00:52:04.747 --> 00:52:09.185
Hold on. Is the great
Puss in Boots asking for help?

1146
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:11.062
Sí, help. You were right.

1147
00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:13.523
- The beard is disgusting.
- And?

1148
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:16.818
And it's like a possum
crawled on my face.

1149
00:52:16.842 --> 00:52:17.902
And?

1150
00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:20.447
And died of shame.

1151
00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:22.306
Okay, okay, possum face.

1152
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.477
- I won't make you beg.
- (grunts)

1153
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.789
Ow! (grunts)

1154
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:30.999
Hey, slow down. Oh!

1155
00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:32.208
Go with the grain.

1156
00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:34.127
You got to go with the grain.

1157
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.628
- I know what I'm doing.
- Hey!

1158
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:39.132
I'm a master of the blade.
Right, Perrito?

1159
00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:41.217
- (laughing)
- What? What? What's funny?

1160
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:43.285
- Nothing should be funny.
- KITTY: Shh. Quieto.

1161
00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:54.522
Ah, there's that handsome face
I remember.

1162
00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:57.067
The face I haven't seen since...

1163
00:52:57.091 --> 00:52:59.235
- Hey!
- ...Santa Coloma.

1164
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:02.822
Ah, yes. Santa Coloma.

1165
00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.598
You had it coming.

1166
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:09.269
Here. You can have
my gatito blade.

1167
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:11.706
Thank you.

1168
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.190
Better than a stick.

1169
00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:18.362
Vaya con Dios, stick sword.

1170
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:20.548
(yelps)

1171
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:23.676
- (yapping)
- Perro, what are you doing?

1172
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.179
Perro. (whistles)

1173
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.430
Where did that crazy dog go?

1174
00:53:27.454 --> 00:53:29.015
(singsongy):
I think you like him.

1175
00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.433
No. No, I don't.

1176
00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:32.268
(singsongy): I think
you're ready to name him.

1177
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.188
No, I just need his easy path
to get my wish.

1178
00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:36.523
You mean my wish.

1179
00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:38.799
JACK HORNER: You mean my wish!

1180
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.277
Sorry.

1181
00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:42.529
(horses neighing)

1182
00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:45.305
(Baker's Dozen
grunting fiercely)

1183
00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.037
- The Baker's Dozen.
- Let him go.

1184
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.206
Oh, I don't know.
I might keep him.

1185
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.375
Would you like a treat?

1186
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:57.377
Nice granny bag, Little Jack.

1187
00:53:57.401 --> 00:53:59.170
It's not a granny bag.

1188
00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:01.381
It is a magic nanny bag.

1189
00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:03.383
Now, make with the map,

1190
00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:07.220
or we'll see what
the unicorn horn really does.

1191
00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:08.888
- (whimpers)
- (Puss gasps)

1192
00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:12.142
Y-Y-You're not gonna shoot
a puppy, are you, Jack?

1193
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:13.518
Yeah, in the face. Why?

1194
00:54:13.542 --> 00:54:15.395
- (yelling)
- What the...

1195
00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:17.355
Give us the map, or else

1196
00:54:17.379 --> 00:54:18.690
- the baker man gets it.
- BABY: Yeah!

1197
00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:21.860
I don't even have the map,
Little Bo Creep.

1198
00:54:21.884 --> 00:54:23.153
(yells, grunts)

1199
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:24.988
Stop throwing my men at me!

1200
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:27.282
- (screams)
- Come here!

1201
00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:28.575
Puss in Boots has the map!

1202
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:31.744
- Let's get him!
- (Goldi yelling)

1203
00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:33.288
(all yelling)

1204
00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:35.415
- (gulps)
- I've got a plan.

1205
00:54:35.439 --> 00:54:38.209
First one to the dog
gets the wish! (yells)

1206
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:39.335
What?

1207
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:41.612
Oh, come on!

1208
00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:43.466
(yelling)

1209
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:44.924
(distorted grunting)

1210
00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.050
(laughs)

1211
00:54:46.074 --> 00:54:47.784
- (grunts fiercely)
- (gasps)

1212
00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.180
(yowls)

1213
00:54:50.204 --> 00:54:51.764
- (growls)
- (screaming)

1214
00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.808
Steady.

1215
00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:55.185
(yelling, grunting)

1216
00:54:55.209 --> 00:54:56.811
- Whoa!
- (gasps)

1217
00:54:56.835 --> 00:54:58.271
(noisemaker blares)

1218
00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:00.106
(spits) What?

1219
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.483
(laughing)

1220
00:55:01.507 --> 00:55:03.234
So that's what they do. Cool.

1221
00:55:03.258 --> 00:55:05.069
No! Not cool.

1222
00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:06.863
Ah, you shot me.

1223
00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:08.364
(noisemaker blares)

1224
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:09.991
Ah, the sight's off.

1225
00:55:10.015 --> 00:55:11.451
(sneezes)

1226
00:55:11.475 --> 00:55:13.786
- I got him, Mr. Horner!
- JACK HORNER: My bad.

1227
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.954
Oh, no.

1228
00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.289
(high-pitched ringing)

1229
00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.981
(muffled thudding)

1230
00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:26.323
(wolf whistling)

1231
00:55:27.866 --> 00:55:29.952
(heart thumping rapidly)

1232
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.672
(gasps)

1233
00:55:44.508 --> 00:55:46.236
Puss, wait!

1234
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.196
- Perro.
- (grunts)

1235
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.847
Thanks for the map, Softpaws.

1236
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:55.352
- (gasps)
- (rumbling)

1237
00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:01.084
- No, no, no!
- No!

1238
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:05.171
Oi! You've just been crimed
by the Three Bears Crime Family.

1239
00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.549
- Yeah!
- So long, you plonkers!

1240
00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:10.176
!Los voy hacer a todos
alfombras de baño!

1241
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.929
(groans) Puss, where are you?

1242
00:56:12.953 --> 00:56:15.372
(panting)

1243
00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:19.626
(screams)

What's going on with you, Puss?

I...

1256
00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:19.579
I am down to my last life.

I am afraid.

You should tell Kitty.

- She would understa...
- No, no, no, no.

1267
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.148
She cannot hear of this.

1268

But that's just one bad heist.

1274
00:57:57.057 --> 00:58:00.370
Santa Coloma wasn't a heist,
Perrito.

1275
00:58:00.394 --> 00:58:05.625
It was a church,
with a priest and guests.

You left her at the altar?

It was wrong. I know.

1283
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:23.601
I am ashamed.

1284

I just wish I hadn't
hurt her so badly.

1285
00:58:27.462 --> 00:58:29.631
I regret that day.

1286
00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:32.819
So, maybe you should
tell that to Kitty.

1287
00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:35.697
Might make you feel better.

1288
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:38.724

Kitty. I lost the map.

No matter how you make it,

Stop it, all of you.

1348
01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:43.449
Maybe our wishes
have been granted.

1349
01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.785
Just stop.
It's not our wish granted.

1350
01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:46.869
It's an obstacle.

1351
01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.831
It's the forest playing tricks.

1352
01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.107
This isn't real.
None of this is...

The day a little orphan girl

1368
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.679
broke into our cabin
and stole our hearts.

1369
01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.205

How's it going?
Can you see anything up there?

Not yet, Perrito... (yells)

- Sí, I am good.

1374
01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.659
(chuckling): So good.

1377
01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.876
If you wanted to hold my hand,
all you had to do is ask.

Uh, just, uh,
feel free to pull me up

1379
01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.756
whenever you get a chance.

1380
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.091
Oh, I was just remembering

1381
01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.719
the last time
I offered you my hand.

1382
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.746
Only, that time,
I believe you had cold feet.

1383
01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:31.873

1384
01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.420

1386
01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.235
About that day.

1387
01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:46.405
Puss in Boots is not
supposed to be afraid.

1388
01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:50.743
But outside that church
in Santa Coloma,

1389
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:56.207
that was the first time
I ever felt fear.

1390
01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:59.150
So I ran.

1391
01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.255
It was a mistake, Kitty.

1392
01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:04.632
It's okay.

1393
01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.884
- No, no. It was cowardly.
- It's okay.

1394
01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.928
- You alone at the altar.
- Puss.

1395
01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.263
In your beautiful,
poofy wedding dress.

1396
01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:14.016
Puss! It's okay.

1397
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.268
I didn't show up, either.

1398
01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.770
Wait, what?

1399
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.939
What do you mean,
you didn't show up?

1400
01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:22.316
Well, I knew
I could never compete

1401
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.276
with your one true love.

1402
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.278
- Who?
- Yourself.

1403
01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.363
The legend.

1404
01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:28.656
Uh...

1405
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.974
I wasn't gonna show up
for that guy.

1406
01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:35.353
But you don't seem
like that guy anymore.

1407
01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.793
Everything okay up there?

1408
01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.920
I'm giving you a thumbs-up,
just so you know.

1409
01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.529
KITTY: Puss!

1410
01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.324
Look.

1411
01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.263
What do you think, bug?

1412
01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.849
Do I wait for the cats to steal
the map and then kill them,

1413
01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:57.226
or do I just kill everybody
all at once?

1414
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.311
You know, I'm starting to think

1415
01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.897
you don't appreciate
the value of a life.

1416
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.482
What? No.

1417
01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.900
I mean, I love these guys.

1418
01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:06.277

I never had much as a kid.

1425

Just loving parents
and stability and a mansion

1426
01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.883
and a thriving baked goods
enterprise for me to inherit.

1427

- For me.

1433
01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.026
And no one else gets any.

1434
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.028

1593
01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:42.983
I haven't got dingleberries.

1594
01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.943
No, you do. You do have 'em.

1595
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.111
(laughing): Dingleberries!

1596
01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.529
Oi! You shut up,
you little mutt,

1597
01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:49.448
or I'll cut you
from pooper to snooter!

1598
01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.950
(gasps) I'm in the mix now.

1599
01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.869
Okay! Okay, here we go.

1600
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.371
You're all a bunch
of knuckle-dragging,

1601
01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.290
honey-scrounging, grub (bleep),

1602
01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.334
oafish (bleep),
(bleep) munching,

1603
01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:01.752
mangy (bleep) nugget,

1604
01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:03.086
(bleep),

1605
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.488
and your snooter! (laughs)

1606
01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:08.258
(laughs)
I like the cut of his jib.

1607
01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.010
Ah, this is great.

1608
01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:14.640
Razzin' and ribbin' and barbin'
and poopin' and snootin'.

1609
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:18.227
Oh, I wish I had
a family like this. (sighs)

1610
01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.395
Speaking from one orphan
to another, Goldi,

1611
01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:23.005
you won the orphan lottery.

1612
01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.151
I like his jib as well.

1613
01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.070
- Let's keep him. (gasps)
- What?

1614
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.447
PAPA: Huh? Where'd he go?

1615
01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.057
- No! We said no crime-backs.
- No, Baby, wait!

1616
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.537

This has been fun, huh?

1623
01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.176
Yeah, but could you tell me
how to get out of here?

1624
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.077
I've got to get back
to Dog and Kitty.

Yeah, get those lives back.

(crowd chanting
"Puss in Boots!")

1630

Puss in Boots walks alone.

1632
01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:20.646
Yeah, Puss in Boots walks alone.

1633
01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:26.736
Was the legend so big there was
no room for anyone else?

1634
01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.551
Oh, the legend's
still big, gato.

1635
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.219
It's you that got small.

1636
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.388
Yeah, you changed, man.

1637
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.432
I hear he's best friends
with a dog now.

1638
01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.309
And he doesn't even
have a sword.

1639
01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.436
(laughs) Some hero.

1640
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.563
You've become a scaredy-cat.

1641
01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.398
We should call him
Wuss in Boots.

1642
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.733
- Ah, no, no, no, no.
- (laughter)

1643
01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.235
Didn't you hear?
His new name is Pickles.

1644
01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.903
- So lame.
- (laughter)

1645
01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.323
Where is your litter box,
Pickles?

1646
01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:56.408
You know what?
You guys are jerks.

1647
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.410
Which is very conflicting
for me.

1648
01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.078
I'll find my own way out. Adios.

1649
01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.456
Oh, you think you are
better than us?

1650
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.834
Without us, you will always
live a life of...

1651
01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.794
Fear.

1652
01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:08.795
You.

1653
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:11.673
I do love the smell of fear.

1654
01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.592
(sniffs) It's intoxicating.

1655
01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.135
(hiccups) It is?

1656
01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.513
Sorry to crash the party
with your past lives.

1657
01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.557
(chuckling):
Or your past deaths,

1658
01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.625
as I like to call them.

1659
01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:27.272
(echoing): I was there
to witness all of them.

1660
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.817
Each frivolous end.

1661
01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:35.197
But you didn't even notice me

1662
01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:41.644
because Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death, right?

1663
01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.481
But you're not laughing now.

1664
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.460
You are no bounty hunter.

1665
01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.045
You are...

1666
01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.488
Death.

1667
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.967
And I don't mean it
metaphorically

1668
01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:58.845
or rhetorically or poetically
or theoretically

1669
01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.807
or in any other fancy way.

1670
01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:05.310
I'm Death, straight up.

1671
01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:08.271
And I've come for you,
Puss in Boots.

1672
01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.148
But I'm still alive.

1673
01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.650
(chuckles) You know...

1674
01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.819
(inhales sharply)
I'm not a cat person.

1675
01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:18.824
I find the very idea
of nine lives absurd.

1676
01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:21.952
And you didn't value
any of them.

1677
01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:25.163
So, why don't I do us
both a favor

1678
01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.582
and take this last one now?

1679
01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.334
That's cheating!

1680
01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.002
Shh. Don't tell.

1681
01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.838
Run, Puss in Boots!

1682
01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.548

Makes it more fun for me.

What's so blasted important

that you've got us stranded

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.304
I need this wish.

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:12.289
Oh, yeah? You want to know
what my wish was?

I've never had that.

without a wish.

(squawks)

1945
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:15.803
What?

1946
01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:19.581
(yelps)
What did I do to deserve this?

1947
01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.752
I mean, what specifically...?

1948
01:30:24.753 --> 01:30:26.564
(rumbling)

1949
01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:29.132

1950
01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:33.904
(all oohing and aahing)

1951
01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:35.680
MAMA: Gorgeous.

1952
01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:40.786
I hate to say it,
but should we make a wish?

1953
01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:44.624
Kitty, one life spent with you

1954
01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:46.941
is all that I could wish for.

1955
01:30:57.494 --> 01:30:59.805
BABY (crying):
You saved my life, sis.

1956
01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:01.807
You was gonna make the wish,
but you didn't make the wish

1957
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.434
'cause you wanted
to save your family.

1958
01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.227
- (shushing)
- And I-I was really scared.

1959
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:06.562
And then... (sobbing)

1960
01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.439
Oi, don't get
so blubbery about it.

1961
01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.107
Whose porridge would I eat
otherwise?

1962
01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:13.194
I'm sorry you didn't get
your wish, Goldi, love.

1963
01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:14.362
But I did, Mama.

1964
01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:16.322
I did get my wish.

1965
01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.282
Everything...

1966
01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.951
is just right.

1967
01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.119
Oh.

1968
01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:23.788
Oh, now you've made me cry.

1969
01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:25.081
Aw.

1970
01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.750
Now, what say we all go home
and hibernate?

1971
01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:30.670
Hey, Goldi, you are a chip
off the old block, you are.

1972
01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:33.172
Well, what can I say?

1973
01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:35.240
I won the orphan lottery.

1974
01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:38.052
Softpaws, Boots.

1975
01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:39.470
- Goldi.
- Bears.

1976
01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.556
Hey, Baby, you got any ideas
for our next job?

1977
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.392
Oh! Remember that pie factory?

1978
01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:46.435
I suspect that
they might be experiencing

1979
01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:47.937
a leadership vacuum.

1980
01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:49.647
(chuckling):
Oh, family business.

1981
01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:51.315
Oh, how exciting.

1982
01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:55.027
Now's a good time to talk about
ethical business practices.

1983

cockroach on my nose!

1984
01:31:57.846 --> 01:31:59.740

- GOLDI: Hold still.

1985
01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:01.492

Oh, no, no, wait just a second.

- Ow! Hey! Hang on!

1987
01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:05.579
Hey, Perrito, about that name.

1988
01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:07.164
Let's pick one out for you.

1989
01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:09.542
Yeah. Oh, what about "Chiquito"?

1990
01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:11.168
- Hmm...
- Ah. "Chomper."

1991
01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.461
What do you think, Perrito?

1992
01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:13.671
"Chomper," no?

1993
01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:15.131
I got it, I got it.

1994
01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:16.966
How about "Jeff"?

1995
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:18.467
- Jeff?
- Yeah.

1996
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:20.010
He doesn't have a Jeff's face.

1997
01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:20.971
(chuckling)

1998
01:32:20.995 --> 01:32:22.680
You know,
if it's the same to you,

1999
01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:24.682
I think I'll just stick
with "Perrito."

2000
01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:26.350
I kind of like it,

2001
01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.227
since that's what
my friends call me.

2002
01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:31.713
- Then "Perrito" it shall be.
- (Puss chuckles softly)

2003
01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:34.859
PUSS: You know, to be honest,
"Chomper" is pretty good.

2004
01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.527
PERRITO: Yeah, but no.

2005
01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:38.612

uh, workshopping it.

my captain's hat?

2009
01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:58.549
- Yes, Governor.
- (squawks)

2010

your captain's coat

2011

We did not agree to this.

2019
01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:20.404
Yeah, it makes us
look ridiculous.

Dokey doke.

2025

Where are we headed, anyways?

2026
01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.751
Off to find new adventures

2027
