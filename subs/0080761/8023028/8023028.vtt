About 20 miles?

78
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.318
About that.

79
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.662
Camp Blood. They're
opening that place again?

80
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:20.576
[Man] Lotsa luck.

81
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.450
Can I get a bus or something?

82
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.667
[Woman] Not likely.

83
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.162
You goin' out to the crossroads, Enis?

84
00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:29.038
What about a lift? That'll be halfway.

85
00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.173
No sweat, Trudy.

I dunno.

92
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.479
You're going to Camp Blood, ain't ya?

93
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.196
God damn it, Ralph. Get outta here.

94

Go on, get!

95
00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.074
Leave people alone!

96
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.818
You'll never come back again.

97
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.945
Oh, shut up, Ralph.

98
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.866
It's got a death curse.

99
00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.253
He's a real prophet of doom, ain't he?

100
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.169
Go and climb up, miss.

101
00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.551

I tell ya he's causing problems enough

104
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.483
for your boss with all that talk.

105
00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.616
God damn nuisance.

106
00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.825
(engine rumbling)

107
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:05.013
He tell you anything?

108
00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:08.313
- Who?
- Your boss

110
00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.806
Steve Christy.

111
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.309
I'll be cooking for
50 kids and 10 staff.

112
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.859
Campers will mostly be
like inner city children.

113
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.322
I mean about what happened.

114
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.115
No.

115
00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:33.288
Come on, there's something
you're not telling me.

116
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.209
Quit. Quit now.

117
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.176
Quit? Why would I wanna quit?

118
00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.054
Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed.

119
00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.384
Oh, terrific. Not you, too.

120
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.386
You sound like your crazy
friend back there, Ralph.

121
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:49.262
Well, maybe.

122
00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:52.732
Did Christy tell you about
the two kids murdered in '58?

123
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.272
Yeah? Boy drowning in '57?

124
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.645
Buncha fires?

125
00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.865
Nobody knows who did any of 'em.

126
00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:04.407
In 1962 they was gonna
open up, the water was bad.

127
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.998
Christy will wind up just like
his folks; crazy and broke.

128
00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:11.493
He's been up there a year
fixing up that place.

129
00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:13.745
He must've dropped $25,000.

130
00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.871
And for what?

131
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.835
Ask anybody.

132
00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:19.630
Quit!

133
00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:26.049
- I can't.
- Dumb kids. Know-it-alls.

135
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.014
Just like my nieces.
Heads full of rocks.

137
00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:35.066
- You're an American original.
- I'm an American original.

139
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:40.146
- Dumb kid.
- At least I'm not afraid of ghosts.

141
00:11:42.285 --> 00:11:44.776
(Annie laughs)

142
00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.829

(engine rumbling)

144
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.136
Take care of yourself, kid!

145
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.013
- No sweat.
- Thanks a lot for the lift.

147
00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:12.979
(door thuds)
(engine rumbling)

148
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.485

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.040
(upbeat country music)
(engine rumbling)

150
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.041
- Hey, uh, Marcie.
- What?

151
00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:44.673
You really think there'll be other gorgeous
women at Camp Crystal Lake besides yourself?

153
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:46.595
(all laughing)

154
00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.303
- Is sex all you ever think about Ned, huh, huh?
- Hey, no, no.

156
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.096
- Absolutely not.
- Ha.

157
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.186
[Ned] Sometimes I just
think about kissing women.

158
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:58.149
(upbeat music)
(muffled talking)

159
00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:04.276

(engine rumbling)

162
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.034
[Steve] Hey, wanna
give me a hand over here?

163
00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:02.580
- Sure.
- Alice!

165
00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:03.877
So, I wanna get this tree stump up.

166
00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.759
Get on this side, you pull on that side
and help on three, okay?

168
00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.344

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:17.603
I'm Ned Rubenstein.

175
00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:18.596

176
00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.269
- Thank you.
- We're, uh, this is Alice.

177
00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.813
Hi. Uh, Steve, cabin B's all ready.

178
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.684
[Steve] Listen, where's Bill?

179
00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.527
Is he finished cleaning
up the boathouse yet?

180
00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.522
I don't know, I haven't seen
him in the past half hour.

181
00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.522
Oh, I want him to start
painting right away.

182
00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.070
Well, what about Brenda?

183
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:33.195
- You told her to go set up the archery range.
- No, no, I rather she paint.

185
00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:35.197
Well, come on, let's go.
(Alice sighs)

186
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:39.709
- I thought we had two weeks.
- Uh, come on, I'll show you where you can get changed.

188
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.577
- Okay.
- Grab your clothes with yas.

189
00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:42.453
[Jack] Back here.

190
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:48.218

(clattering)

192
00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:52.175
- Here, let me give you a hand with that.
- Thank you.

194
00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.548
Yeah, I got it.

195
00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.353
(hammer banging)

196
00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.228
Got it?

197
00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:22.244
(paper rustling)

198
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.209
You draw very well.

199
00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:31.135
Thanks, I wish had more time to do it.

200
00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:35.223
(hammer banging)
Ow, dummy.

201
00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.471
- When did you do this?
- Last night.

203
00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:43.522
- Do I really look like that?
- You did last night.

205
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:55.030
- You're very talented.
- You're very pretty.

207
00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:03.166
This really isn't your cup of tea, is it?
Any particular reason?

209
00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:07.329
It's just a problem I have.
It's nothing personal.

211
00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.794
You wanna leave?

212
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.839
I don't know, I may have to go back
to California to straighten something out.

214
00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.180
(Steve sighs)

215
00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:23.263
Come on.
Give me another chance.

217
00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.774
Stay a week, help get the place ready.

218
00:16:28.362 --> 00:16:33.606
By Friday, if you're not happy,
I'll put you on the bus myself.

220
00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:36.530
All right, Friday.

221
00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.526
I'll give it a week.

222
00:16:43.211 --> 00:16:45.327
(birds chirping)

223
00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:46.293
[Steve] Thanks, Alice.

224
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:54.593
(ominous music)

225
00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:59.344
(ground rustling)

226
00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.721
[Alice] Bill, Steve wants
to know if we need more paint.

227
00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:07.390
Paint's all right, think we're gonna
need some more thinner though.

229
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:08.857
[Alice] Okay, I'll tell him.

230
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.725
- Alice.
- Yes?

231
00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:10.672
The others show up?

233
00:17:10.673 --> 00:17:13.567
Yeah, everybody except that girl who's 
supposed to handle the kitchen, Annie.

234
00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.690
[Bill] Think you're
gonna last all summer?

235
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:17.737
I don't know if I'm gonna last all week.

236
00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:18.700
(Bill laughs)

237
00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.490
I'll tell Steve about the thinner.

238
00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:22.113
[Bill] All right.

239
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.706
(ominous music)

240
00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.999
(ground rustling)

241
00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:38.546
[Jack] Do you want it listed separately?

242
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.388
That's right.

243
00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.766
And after lunch, Brenda, I want you
to finish up the archery range, okay?

245
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.887
Now, if Annie gets here, get
her started in the kitchen.

246
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.559
- Got it.
- Do your best, all right?

247
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.853
I'll be back sometime after lunch.

248
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.272
It's supposed to rain like hell
so get as much done as possible.

250
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.111
I don't wanna get too far behind.

251
00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:57.278
(engine rumbling)

252
00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.285
Goodbye.

253
00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:04.155
He neglected to mention that downtown
they call this place Camp Blood.

255
00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:09.748
Next you're gonna tell us there are poisonous
snakes in the outhouses, and crocodiles.

257
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:12.121
[Ned] Nah, the crocodiles
are in the cabins.

258
00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:15.796
(birds chirping)

259
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.216
(Ioons calling)

260
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.637
(plastic rustling)

261
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:36.571
(crickets chirping)

262
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.781
(arrow whizzing)
Ta da!

263
00:18:41.704 --> 00:18:46.080
- Are you crazy?
- Wanna see my trick shot? It's even better.

265
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:48.748
(Ned laughs)

266
00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:53.713
I don't believe you!

267
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:57.587
Ya know, you're beautiful
when you're angry, sweetheart.

268
00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:58.425
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

269
00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:02.047
Did you come out here to help
me or to scare me to death?

270
00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.131
If you do that again I'm gonna tack
you up on the wall to dry.

272
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:06.225
Yeah, but I love that sexy talk!

273
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:11.855
(birds chirping)
(water trickling)

274
00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:14.646
(engine rumbling)

275
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.044
Hi. I'm going to Camp Crystal Lake.

277
00:19:34.048 --> 00:19:36.790
(engine rumbling)

278
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.187
Guess I always wanted
to work with children.

279
00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:53.727
I hate when people call them kids.

280
00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:56.441
It sounds like little goats.

281
00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:59.357
But when you've had a dream as long
as I have you'll do anything.

283
00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:05.572
(engine rumbling)

284
00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:25.345
Hey, wasn't that the road up
for Camp Crystal Lake back there?

286
00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:28.557
(light dramatic music)

287
00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:32.853
Uh, I think we better stop.

288
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.982
(engine rumbling)

289
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:37.771
Please?

290
00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:41.111
(dramatic music)

291
00:20:41.115 --> 00:20:44.531
Stop, please.
Please stop!

293
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:46.950
Please stop!

294
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:52.620
(intense music)
(Annie shrieks)

295
00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:54.412
(tires screeching)

296
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.832
(Annie groans)

297
00:20:56.839 --> 00:21:01.799
(engine rumbling)
(suspenseful music)

298
00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.755
Ow.

299
00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.474
(doors thudding)

300
00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:13.302
Ow.
(dramatic music)

301
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:16.101
(leaves rustling)

302
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.219
(suspenseful music)
(Ioons calling)

303
00:21:51.227 --> 00:21:54.014
(leaves rustling)

304
00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:07.405
(dramatic music)
(Annie grunts)

305
00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.821
(eerie music)

306
00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:14.242
No. No.

308
00:22:17.044 --> 00:22:18.409
No.

309
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.335
(eerie music)
(Annie gasps)

310
00:22:24.718 --> 00:22:27.130
(body thuds)

311
00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:32.465
- All right, move it!
- Come on!

312
00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:33.556
- A little to the left!
- All right!

313
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:38.521
- A little to the left!
(all hollering)

314
00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:41.390
Move it out, move it out!
Okay, a little to the left.

316
00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:42.312
Now, now, a little.

317
00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:43.729
- No, no.
- Okay, baby,

318
00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:44.852
let's float it out there.

319
00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:46.104
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

320
00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:48.697
(all hollering)

321
00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:56.204
(birds chirping)

322
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:03.670
Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream
what would it be?

324
00:23:03.674 --> 00:23:04.538
(water trickling)

325
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.791
Rocky roll.
(al laughing)

326
00:23:06.802 --> 00:23:11.341
Hey!
(water splashes)

327
00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:14.385
(ominous music)
(leaves rustling)

328
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:19.353
(muffled talking)
(water splashing)

329
00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:24.274
What's that vitamin C
stuff do for you anyway?

330
00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:27.486
Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize
the nitrates or something.

332
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.532
[Marcie] What's the
matter? You see something?

333
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:35.152
(Ioons calling)

334
00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:37.450
No, no, no.

335
00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:42.163
(Brenda shrieks)

336
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:43.786
- Ned!
- Here we go.

337
00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:45.958
[Brenda] Get outta here!

338
00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:50.459
[Ned] Brenda, I'm getting to you.

339
00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:51.677
Very slowly.

340
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.296
[Brenda] (laughs) You, you!

341
00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:57.050
[Marcie] Hey, you guys.
You ready to go back to work?

342
00:23:57.061 --> 00:23:58.471
- Yeah.

343
00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:00.720
(birds chirping)
- Oh, oh.

344
00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:05.224
- Come on, Alice.
- Help! Help!

346
00:24:05.235 --> 00:24:09.979
- Something's wrong with Ned.
Get a life preserver.

348
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.356
(clattering)

349
00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:16.820
(water splashing)

350
00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:22.578
- Here.
- Help!

352
00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:30.045
- Jeez, where is he? Did he swim?
- I don't know, he's not here.

354
00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:32.885
He was around right around here somewhere.

355
00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:34.674
Go ahead, dive for him.

356
00:24:34.682 --> 00:24:37.173
(water splashing)

357
00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:38.390
- There he is.
- Right there he is.

358
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:41.136
- Come on, you guys, help me.
- Watch his head.

359
00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:42.511
- Here.
- Hang on.

360
00:24:42.523 --> 00:24:43.603
- [Alice] Grab, pull it out.

361
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:45.222
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

362
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:47.190
Move it away.
(water splashing)

363
00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:48.684
- Hold him.
- Watch his head.

364
00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:50.232
- I got him.
- Here.

365
00:24:52.032 --> 00:24:54.569
(Ned coughing)

366
00:24:56.745 --> 00:24:58.360
- Can you give mouth-to-mouth?
- Yeah.

367
00:24:58.372 --> 00:25:00.200
- Pull up his head.
- Come on.

369
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.084
(heavy breathing)

370
00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:06.793
- Oh god, is he all right?
- Come on, Ned.

371
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:08.003
- Hurry up, hurry up.
- Come on, Ned.

372
00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:10.123
- Come on.
- Oh, Ned!

373
00:25:10.134 --> 00:25:11.749
Oh, Jesus!
(all yelling)

374
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.422
(everyone hollering over each other)

375
00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:19.093
[Ned] Sorry!

376
00:25:19.101 --> 00:25:20.762
I'm sorry, all right?

377
00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:25.183
(bird cawing)

378
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:27.852
(birds chirping)

379
00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:32.152
(Alice sighs)

380
00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:34.943
(drawer rattling)

381
00:25:42.249 --> 00:25:45.207
(suspenseful music)

382
00:25:46.628 --> 00:25:51.588
(dramatic music)
(Alice shrieks)

383
00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:55.200
(door squeaks)
Bill!

384
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.298
Bill!

385
00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:59.888
Come here, quick!
Hurry!

387
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:02.679
(ground rustling)

388
00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:08.438
- What is it?
- There's a snake over there.

390
00:26:08.442 --> 00:26:09.227
Where?

391
00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:18.607
What do I do?

392
00:26:19.912 --> 00:26:22.615
- It might bite.
- Haven't you ever been in the woods?

394
00:26:22.623 --> 00:26:24.033
We're not in the woods!

395
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.199
- Jesus, Bill, what are you doing?
- There's a snake in here.

397
00:26:27.211 --> 00:26:30.544
- Then why are we in here?
- Whoa, feet don't fail me now!

399
00:26:30.547 --> 00:26:34.836
There it is!
(all screaming)

400
00:26:34.843 --> 00:26:36.708
[Marcie] I can't sleep
with a snake in here.

401
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.506
[Brenda] Nobody told
us anything about snakes.

402
00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:40.095
- KiII it!

403
00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:41.179
- [Ned] You heard the lady.

404
00:26:41.183 --> 00:26:44.137
- I can't get it til it comes out.
- Well, call him.

406
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:45.680
- How do you call a snake?

407
00:26:45.687 --> 00:26:49.100
- I'II flush it out!
(all screaming)

408
00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:53.483
(all screaming)

409
00:26:53.487 --> 00:26:55.102
[Jack] I got it.

410
00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:56.570
- Where?
- I got him.

411
00:26:56.573 --> 00:27:01.237
I got him.
(metal clanging)

412
00:27:01.245 --> 00:27:04.112
(thudding)
Oh god.

413
00:27:08.252 --> 00:27:13.086
- Is it dead?
- Either that or its got a very short clone.

415
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.172
(girl scoffs)
Oh god.

416
00:27:15.175 --> 00:27:18.258
Well, at least we
know what's for dinner.

417
00:27:18.262 --> 00:27:19.547
- Oh.
- Marcie!

418
00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:21.341
- Gross.
- So sick.

419
00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:23.634
God.
(all laughing)

420
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.757
(bird cawing)

421
00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:27.013
[Brenda] I'm making salad, do you want me
to go ahead and make some for everybody?

423
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.226
Oh, that'd be great.

424
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.595
I think we've got some
hamburger in there, too.

425
00:27:29.606 --> 00:27:32.147
- None for me, thank you.
- But there are apples.

427
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:34.983
- Do you know how to make apple pie?
- Oh, sure, no sweat.

429
00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:36.773
(engine rumbling)
Whoa, what is going on?

430
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.442
(Ned hollering)

431
00:27:47.207 --> 00:27:48.207
Oh shit.

432
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:53.251
- All right, who are you people?
- Camp counselors.

434
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:55.712
- Uh, Neddy's just fooling around.
- Yeah, right, I'm just fooling around.

436
00:27:55.716 --> 00:27:58.172
Hey, can it, goat cheese.
Steve Christy hire you people?

438
00:27:58.177 --> 00:27:59.007
(Brenda hums)

439
00:27:59.011 --> 00:27:59.796
He pay you for this?

440
00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:00.633
- Yeah.
- Hey, nice bike.

441
00:28:00.637 --> 00:28:03.670
- Have you been smoking, boy?
- Smoking? Don't smoke.

443
00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:05.092
Causes cancer.
You know what I mean.

444
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.556
What, did you just get off
a space ship or something?

445
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.347
Columbian gold, man.
Grass, hash, the weed.

446
00:28:10.272 --> 00:28:12.641
Hey, what's he talking about?
Hey, don't get smart.

448
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:14.355
[Ned] Me? I'm as dumb as they come.

449
00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:16.771
Hey, not another word
outta you, you understand me?

450
00:28:16.778 --> 00:28:17.608
- Officer.
- Sure, officer.

451
00:28:17.613 --> 00:28:19.353
- Really, nothing's going on here.

452
00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:21.897
- We're just trying to get the place in shape.
- In shape for what?

454
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:24.900
- Officer, is there anything we can do to help?
- We'd be glad to help out.

456
00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:26.118
Looking for somebody.

457
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:29.909
- Now who's that?
- A guy named Ralph. The town crazy.

459
00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:32.408
Well, there's no crazy
people around here, right?

460
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.035
I told you to sit on it, Tonto.

461
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.290
Now, I got word that Ralph was peddling
out this way spouting his gospel.

463
00:28:40.302 --> 00:28:42.880
Well, we haven't seen anybody here, officer.
Just us.

465
00:28:42.888 --> 00:28:45.846
Uh, this guy Ralph, is he dangerous?

466
00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:48.511
Every time that loony gets
drunk he gets his call in.

467
00:28:48.518 --> 00:28:51.218
I end up spending the morning in court
and he gets a week in jail.

469
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.312
(radio beeps)
Cycle 2, where are you?

470
00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:56.853
Come in, Cycle 2, Cycle 2.

471
00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.193
This is Dorf, I'm out here
at Camp Crystal Lake, over.

472
00:29:00.197 --> 00:29:01.232
[Dispatch] Pull it back in, Dorf.

473
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.697
Chief wants you back
in town on the double.

474
00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.941
Roger that. 10-4, on my way, out.

475
00:29:08.622 --> 00:29:10.078
Never keep the chief waitin'.

476
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.418
You kids keep your noses
clean, you understand?

477
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:18.002
You'll be hearing from me if you don't.

478
00:29:22.135 --> 00:29:24.376
We ain't gonna stand for
no weirdness out here.

479
00:29:25.722 --> 00:29:30.682
(engine rumbling)
(muffled laughing)

480
00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:51.824
(metal clanging)

481
00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:04.207
(Alice humming)

482
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.300
(dramatic music)
(Alice screams)

483
00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:10.048
(metal clattering)

484
00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:14.392
I'm a messenger of God.
You're doomed if you stay here.

486
00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:20.520
This place is cursed. Cursed.

487
00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:24.687
It's got a death curse.

488
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:27.652
- Who are you?
- What do you want?

489
00:30:28.744 --> 00:30:32.194
- God sent me.
- Get outta here, man.

491
00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:36.740
I've got to warn you.
You're doomed if you stay.

493
00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:41.669
Go. Go!

495
00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:48.968
(door squeaks)

496
00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:52.430
(door thuds)

497
00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:57.140
- I think we just met Ralph.
- God, what's next?

499
00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.646
(Marcie sighs)

500
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.483
(eerie music)

501
00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:06.024
(door squeaks)

502
00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:11.867
You're doomed. You're all doomed.

503
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:18.540
(bike rattles)
(eerie music)

504
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:30.844
(door squeaks)
(door thuds)

505
00:31:39.022 --> 00:31:40.637
- Who likes 'em rare?
- Me!

506
00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:43.853
How can you guys eat that stuff?
It looks like dead animals.

508
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.565
Dead animals? That's the old counselors.
You cannibal.

510
00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:50.689
If you would mix all this stuff right
you would get all the protein you need.

512
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.157
Too bad Annie never showed up,
she was supposed to be quite a good cook.

514
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:55.489
Yeah, well don't expect me
to play chef for you guys.

516
00:31:55.497 --> 00:31:57.158
Uh oh, the squaws are revolting.

517
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.242
- Trouble?
- Yeah, bad bulb or no power.

518
00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:02.413
Seems a little gloomy in here.

519
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:05.336
- Hang on.
- Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator.

521
00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.047
The town power lines are
supposed to be real lousy.

522
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:10.258
- Don't you love that macho talk?

523
00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:12.218
Emergency generator.

524
00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:14.133
- Like I haven't.
- Yeah, let's go.

525
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:15.347
- Wait for me.
- I'll take care of this.

526
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.099
- Neddy, can you watch the burners?
- Sure.

528
00:32:18.103 --> 00:32:18.933
- [Alice] Burner.

529
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.814
- Wanna do this?
- Yeah.

530
00:32:23.817 --> 00:32:27.692
- You really think he's gonna be bent outta shape?
- I don't know.

532
00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:30.395
Hey, this looks almost like the one
at my uncle's cabin in Maine.

534
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.649
- Well, here goes.
- What an antique.

536
00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:36.572
Okay.
(metal clangs)

537
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.572
(generator rumbling)

538
00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.414
What has gone wrong?

539
00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:53.802
(birds chirping)
(bugs trilling)

540
00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:56.888
(bird cawing)

541
00:32:56.892 --> 00:32:59.679
(water trickling)

542
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.437
(muffled talking)

543
00:33:09.446 --> 00:33:12.313
"Da da da da"
No.

544
00:33:13.783 --> 00:33:16.069
(muffled talking)

545
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:18.568
(birds cawing)

546
00:33:34.638 --> 00:33:37.425
(ground rustling)

547
00:33:45.315 --> 00:33:47.931
(Ned whistling)

548
00:33:57.244 --> 00:33:59.610
(light dramatic music)

549
00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:02.237
(wood creaking)

550
00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:04.333
Hello?

551
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.424
(suspenseful music)

552
00:34:14.427 --> 00:34:15.257
Can I help you?

553
00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:20.797
(Ioons calling)

554
00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:25.598
Hello? Hello?

556
00:34:27.983 --> 00:34:29.018
[Marcie] Come on.

557
00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:29.810
I'm coming, I'm coming.

558
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.691
Woo, wind's come up.

559
00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:41.614
Shifted a good 180 degrees.
Guess I'll have to hold onto you.

561
00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:44.237
(lips smacking)

562
00:34:45.292 --> 00:34:48.036
- What about Ned?
- I don't love Ned.

564
00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:51.832
(scoffs)
He keeps acting like such a jerk.

565
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.505
- Neddy! (thunder rumbling)
- Don't call him.

567
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:57.459
I thought you wanted to give him one
of your motherly lectures.

569
00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.553
Look, Neddy's gonna do whatever
Neddy wants to do, ya know?

570
00:35:00.557 --> 00:35:02.297
(thunder rumbling)

571
00:35:02.309 --> 00:35:07.056
Ooh, it's gonna storm. Can tear down
that valley like a son of a gun.

573
00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:09.684
I've been afraid of storms
ever since I was a little kid.

575
00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:12.228
No. Really?
(Marcie laughs)

576
00:35:12.235 --> 00:35:14.851
Yeah, I've had this dream
about five or six times

577
00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:19.569
where I'm in a thunder storm
and it's raining really hard.

579
00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:24.494
It sounds like pebbles
when it hits the ground.

580
00:35:24.497 --> 00:35:25.361
I can hear it.

581
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.123
I try to block out the sound with my hands

582
00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:32.289
only it doesn't work, it just
keeps getting louder and louder.

584
00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:38.004
And then the rain turns to blood

585
00:35:40.347 --> 00:35:44.215
and the blood washes
away in little rivers.

586
00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:48.017
Then the sound stops.

587
00:35:50.899 --> 00:35:53.853
- It's just a dream.
- Yeah, I know.

589
00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.603
I call it my shower dream.
(Jack laughs)

590
00:35:57.614 --> 00:36:00.860
- Hey, hey, this is no dream.
- Come on, we're gonna get soaked.

592
00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:06.658
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

593
00:36:06.665 --> 00:36:09.407
(wind whistling)

594
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.258
(thunder booming)

595
00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:23.048
(water trickling)

596
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:29.096
(door clattering)

597
00:36:32.899 --> 00:36:37.814
(thunder booms)
(lips smacking)

598
00:36:44.703 --> 00:36:47.115
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

599
00:36:57.716 --> 00:37:01.129
(clothes rustling)

600
00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:02.626
[Marcie] Come on.

601
00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:16.731
(Marcie chuckles)

602
00:37:20.447 --> 00:37:25.407
(rain pattering)
(soft moaning)

603
00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:32.155
(thunder booms)

604
00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:41.164
(Jack grunts)

605
00:37:43.887 --> 00:37:45.923
(heavy breathing)

606
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.637
(rain pattering)

607
00:37:52.562 --> 00:37:54.473
(light music)

608
00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:56.597
(door squeaks)

609
00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:59.224
(thunder booms)

610
00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:07.236
- Jack and Marcie are gonna get drenched.
- Not if they're where I think they are.

612
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:10.280
(light guitar music)

613
00:38:30.433 --> 00:38:33.596
(thunder rumbling)

614
00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.434
- That's nice.
- Mm hmm.

615
00:38:35.438 --> 00:38:37.474
Hey, I know what we can do.

616
00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:40.523
- We're going to play Monopoly.
- I hate Monopoly.

618
00:38:40.527 --> 00:38:42.813
[Brenda] Not the way
I play it, you don't.

619
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:45.812
- What?
- We're going to play strip Monopoly.

621
00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:49.490
- I'll be the shoe.
- You have got to be kidding.

623
00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:53.532
- What about if Steve walks in?
- Oh, we'll give him a handicap.

625
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.705
You can keep your boots on.
Everything else goes.

627
00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:59.000
It's easy. Instead of paying
rent, you pay clothes.

629
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:02.086
Bill can be banker, unless,
of course, he's chicken.

630
00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.289
(Alice giggles)
Well, heaven help you if you land on one of my hotels.

632
00:39:05.301 --> 00:39:07.508
[Brenda] Why don't you see if Marcie
left any of that grass?

634
00:39:09.472 --> 00:39:12.468
- What happened to my 5005?
- They're right there. Where's my shoe?

636
00:39:13.476 --> 00:39:16.013
(soft moaning)

637
00:39:31.619 --> 00:39:34.486
(thunder rumbling)

638
00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:03.773
(Jack grunts)

639
00:40:03.776 --> 00:40:06.392
(thunder booms)

640
00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:10.985
(dark dramatic music)

641
00:40:24.672 --> 00:40:28.210
- And that goes-
- I'm not gonna pass Go without a glow.

643
00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:30.833
- We already rolled for you.
- You're going last, okay?

644
00:40:30.845 --> 00:40:33.336
Oh, and community chest cannot
give you your clothes back.

645
00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:35.339
(dice rattling)

646
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.217
Double sixes, I get to roll again.

647
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.228
- I think we're being hustled.
- I think you're right.

649
00:40:42.231 --> 00:40:44.938
(rain pattering)

650
00:40:46.653 --> 00:40:47.517
You are so fine.

651
00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:58.031
Yo, yo, yo, yo, where you going?

652
00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:02.999
Gotta pee.
(thunder rumbles)

653
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.083
- Hurry back, okay?
- It's getting cold in here.

655
00:41:18.685 --> 00:41:21.472
- Save my place for me.
- Oh yeah.

656
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:24.642
(lips smacking)

657
00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:29.518
(door squeaks)
(thunder booms)

658
00:41:29.529 --> 00:41:32.236
(rain pattering)

659
00:41:37.996 --> 00:41:39.577
(dice rattling)

660
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.116
Five. One, two...

661
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.121
- Baltic Avenue. I'll buy it.
- No one ever lands on Baltic Avenue.

663
00:41:46.129 --> 00:41:47.835
I think it's a pretty color.

664
00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.581
Okay.
(dice rattling)

665
00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:54.129
Come on.
Ha, eight.

667
00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:56.093
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

668
00:41:56.097 --> 00:41:59.339
Baltic Avenue.
(Bill groans)

669
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.215
- You owe me one boot.
- Coming.

670
00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:03.764
Alice draws first blood.

671
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:05.807
That's a terrible way
to talk about my feet.

672
00:42:05.815 --> 00:42:07.680
(Brenda laughs)
Thank you.

673
00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:10.684
Who's next?
(dice rattling)

674
00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:14.062
You know, I think I'm
beginning to like this game.

675
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:17.486
Just wait until he lands
on my old Kentucky home.

676
00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:19.074
More beer? More beer.

677
00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:21.319
(Alice laughing)
Let's see, the railroad.

678
00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.037
(rain pattering)

679
00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:29.494
(thunder rumbling)

680
00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:34.339

681
00:42:51.778 --> 00:42:56.693

(Jack gargling)

682
00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:06.031
(thunder rumbling)

683
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:14.172
(ground rustling)

684
00:43:15.218 --> 00:43:17.630
(door squeaks)

685
00:43:17.637 --> 00:43:20.049
(door thuds)

686
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:34.350

687
00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:45.745
(light dramatic music)
(eerie music)

688
00:44:10.773 --> 00:44:13.389
(ominous music)

689
00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.743
"40 Yards to the Outhouse," by Willy Macon.

690
00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:30.081
Come on, kids. You can
do better than that.

691
00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:33.250
(wood creaking)
Jack?

692
00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.045
Jack?

693
00:44:42.805 --> 00:44:45.467
(rain pattering)

694
00:44:45.474 --> 00:44:46.680
Jack?

695
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:49.300
(door creaking)

696
00:44:55.985 --> 00:44:58.818
When I looked into that mirror
I knew I'd always be ugly.

697
00:45:01.449 --> 00:45:05.283
I said, Lizzie, you'll always be plain.

698
00:45:05.286 --> 00:45:08.119
(Marcie laughs)

699
00:45:08.122 --> 00:45:10.204
(rustling)

700
00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:15.168
Hello?
(suspenseful music)

701
00:45:20.176 --> 00:45:22.258
(tapping)

702
00:45:30.937 --> 00:45:33.724

703
00:45:39.362 --> 00:45:42.149

704
00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:44.363
(rattling)

705
00:45:49.038 --> 00:45:50.038
Ned?

706
00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:56.126
Hey, come on, you guys.

707
00:46:08.516 --> 00:46:11.804
(door creaks)

708
00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:15.019
(light dramatic music)

709
00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:24.107
Allee allee in free!
(curtain rattles)

710
00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:27.323
(light dramatic music)

711
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.537
(curtain rattles)

712
00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:45.750

(thunder booms)

717
00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:04.067
(Brenda laughs)
Hello!

718
00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:06.733
Worse run of bad luck since Richard Nixon.

719
00:47:06.741 --> 00:47:08.697
Well, you can always call
it quits if you want to.

720
00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:11.784
Fat chance, you're two steps
from Pacific Avenue

721
00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:13.698
and Skin City.
- Oh.

722
00:47:13.706 --> 00:47:16.368
(dice rattling)

723
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:21.331
- Whoa oh.
- Well, what can I say?

724
00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:22.920
It's not much, but I call it home.

725
00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:24.663
(girls groaning)

726
00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.256
(door thuds)
(Alice screams)

727
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.921
- Oh no!
- Wait a minute!

728
00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:30.253
- I'll get it, I'll get it.
- Get the money down, get the money, now just hold it.

730
00:47:30.264 --> 00:47:31.595
Oh god!
(door thuds)

731
00:47:31.599 --> 00:47:33.385
[Bill] It's blowing
like crazy out there.

732
00:47:33.392 --> 00:47:35.724
- Oh, I think I left the
windows in my cabin open.

733
00:47:35.728 --> 00:47:36.728
Shoot

734
00:47:40.483 --> 00:47:44.065
Well, we're going to have to finish
this game some other night.

736
00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:48.566
Just when it was getting interesting.
See you guys in the morning.

738
00:47:48.574 --> 00:47:50.235
- Okay.
- See ya.

739
00:47:50.242 --> 00:47:52.574
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight!

740
00:47:52.578 --> 00:47:54.159
(Brenda groans)
(door thuds)

741
00:47:54.163 --> 00:47:56.825
(rain pattering)

742
00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:02.326
- Look at this mess.
- Yeah.

743
00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:05.208
Hey, tell me, were you really
gonna go ahead with it?

744
00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:07.923
Actually I haven't made up my mind.

745
00:48:07.927 --> 00:48:10.296
Well, then in that case we'll have
to finish the game another night.

747
00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:12.169
Oh yeah?
(upbeat music)

748
00:48:12.181 --> 00:48:17.096
(rain pattering)
(muffled singing)

749
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:23.806
(plates clattering)

750
00:48:23.818 --> 00:48:27.652
"Please don't let the heart"

751
00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:28.986
- "Belong to anyone"
- Steve.

752
00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:34.317
Is there anything else you want?
- No, no, no thanks, Sandy, I'm fine.

754
00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:37.574
You can't go back out there in that rain.
Do you wanna get drowned?

756
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:40.910
I've got to. I've got six
new counselors up at camp.

758
00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:44.502
They are babes in the woods
in every sense of the word.

759
00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:48.209
Well, they'll be okay if they don't
have to come out in the rain.

761
00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:52.756
- Well, what do I owe ya?
- Just a night on the town, Steve.

763
00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:55.129
(laughs) Come on now,
Sandy, you know what I mean.

764
00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:57.882
That's okay.
Two and a quarter, and that's it.

766
00:48:59.437 --> 00:49:02.304
"Through the night with you"

767
00:49:02.314 --> 00:49:03.554
Thank you.

768
00:49:03.566 --> 00:49:07.775
"And you're the one
who's got to love enough"

769
00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.565
(change jingling)

770
00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:19.286
- Here's you're change, Steve.
- No, you keep it, Sandy.

772
00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:20.496
- Thank you.
- Sure.

773
00:49:20.499 --> 00:49:22.535
- Drive careful.
- I will.

774
00:49:22.543 --> 00:49:23.453
Goodnight.

775
00:49:23.461 --> 00:49:26.248

- Hi!
- Hi!

797
00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:52.915
- Steve.
- I thought that thing would go through anything.

799
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.002
- Not dragging a trailer.

800
00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:55.790
Can you give me a lift?

801
00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:59.085
- Yeah.
- I'll have one of my counselors bring me back in the morning.

803
00:52:59.093 --> 00:52:59.832
Why not?

818
00:55:26.365 --> 00:55:28.401
Please, somebody help me!

819
00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:33.865
Hello?
(thunder rumbles)

820
00:55:33.872 --> 00:55:34.657
Hello?

821
00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:40.249
Hello?

822
00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:46.832
Hello?

823
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:54.756
[Young Jason] Come quickly!

824
00:55:54.768 --> 00:55:56.554
Please, somebody help!

825
00:55:59.064 --> 00:56:04.024
(ground rustling)
(rain pattering)

826
00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:14.776
Where are you?
Hello?

828
00:56:23.088 --> 00:56:28.048
(light dramatic music)
(thunder booms)

829
00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:35.551
(ground rustling)

830
00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:36.344
Hello?

831
00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:43.689
(thudding)
(dramatic music)

832
00:56:43.692 --> 00:56:44.477
All right!

833
00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:50.229
Come on out, it's not funny anymore!

834
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.855
(suspenseful music)

835
00:56:51.867 --> 00:56:53.983
Not funny at all.

836
00:56:53.994 --> 00:56:56.576
(thunder booms)

837
00:57:06.757 --> 00:57:10.591
(muffled screaming)

838
00:57:10.594 --> 00:57:14.712
(rain pattering)
(bugs trilling)

839
00:57:14.723 --> 00:57:17.510
(thunder rumbles)

840
00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:30.272
(light guitar music)

841
00:57:43.877 --> 00:57:46.118
(rustling)

842
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:56.587
(door bangs)

843
00:58:01.353 --> 00:58:04.223
Hi. Generator's okay.

845
00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:05.812
[Alice] I thought I heard a scream.

846
00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:07.431
I don't know how you can hear
anything through that wind.

847
00:58:07.442 --> 00:58:11.108
- It sounded like Brenda.
- I better take a look.

849
00:58:11.113 --> 00:58:14.153
Yeah, and somebody turned on the
lights at the archery range.

851
00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:15.272
[Bill] What?

852
00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:18.358
I can't see anything.

853
00:58:19.871 --> 00:58:21.202
[Alice] They're off now.

854
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:23.989
I'm gonna check it out.

855
00:58:25.419 --> 00:58:29.373
- Bill? Can I come?
- Come on then.

857
00:58:32.551 --> 00:58:35.213
(rain pattering)
Brenda!

858
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.050
Brenda!

859
00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.185
Where is she?

860
00:58:45.647 --> 00:58:47.558
She must be with Jack and Marcie.

861
00:58:49.568 --> 00:58:51.604
(zipper buzzes)

862
00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:53.727
- Now listen.
- Yeah?

863
00:58:53.739 --> 00:58:55.275
[Bill] Come here.

864
00:59:07.919 --> 00:59:11.161
(light dramatic music)

865
00:59:14.676 --> 00:59:16.212
What is going on?

866
00:59:21.183 --> 00:59:23.174
[Bill] Come on!

867
00:59:23.185 --> 00:59:28.145
(rain pattering)
(wind howling)

868
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:30.351
[Alice] Jack!

869
00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:32.394
- Jack!
- Jack, come to the door!

870
00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:35.610
(door squeaks)

871
00:59:35.614 --> 00:59:39.022
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

873
00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:40.399
Come on, come on.

874
00:59:42.704 --> 00:59:44.410
(door thuds)
(knocking)

875
00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:45.414
Brenda?

876
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:48.167
Marcie?

877
00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:51.118
- Jack?
- Jack?

878
00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:53.714
Neddy?

879
00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.798
Bill, I think we should call someone.

880
01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:06.675
If this is a joke I'm gonna bring them.
I'm serious.

882
01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:08.722
I really think we should call someone.

883
01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:13.352
(thunder booming)

884
01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.190
Cellar's locked.
Where's the key?

886
01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:23.484
- I don't know.
- Wait a minute.

888
01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:33.879
Watch out.

889
01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.375
(glass clattering)

890
01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:40.751
[Bill] Careful.

891
01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.011
(door squeaks)

892
01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:44.629
Let me get the light.

893
01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:49.601
(rain pattering)
(wind howling)

894
01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:57.441
- What's wrong?
- It's dead. Try the payphone.

896
01:00:57.445 --> 01:01:02.151
- Do you have a dime or a quarter?
- No, check the desk.

898
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.366
(rustling)

899
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:10.405
(phone ringing)
(coins clattering)

900
01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.417
[Alice] Hello?

901
01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.534
This damn thing's dead too.

902
01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:19.506
(engine sputtering)
(rain pattering)

903
01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:28.264
(doors thudding)

904
01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.391
- What's the matter with it?
- It's wet.

906
01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:35.305
I don't know.

907
01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:39.185
Why don't we just hike outta
here? Just get out right now?

908
01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:42.899
Look, it's 10 miles to the nearest crossroads.
Steve will be back soon.

910
01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.115
We can use his Jeep if
we need to get help.

911
01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:48.595
Don't worry, there's probably some
stupid explanation for all this.

912
01:01:48.596 --> 01:01:50.362
Like what?

913
01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.830
We'll be laughing about
this tomorrow, I promise.

914
01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.752
(lips smacking)

915
01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:57.790
(metal clangs)

916
01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.333
Let's get outta this rain.

917
01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:03.755
(rain pattering)
(engine rumbling)

918
01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.504
It's not bad enough
to have Friday the 13th,

919
01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:08.095
we gotta have a full moon, too.

920
01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.182
I keep statistics.

921
01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:14.394
We have more accidents,
more rapes, more robberies,

922
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.855
more homicides, more of everything
when there's a full moon.

923
01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:20.145
It upsets people, makes them nuts.

924
01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:23.020
Ah, could make a
science outta coincidence.

925
01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.740
Dear old Ralph was out your way today.

926
01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:31.324
His wife was a nervous
wreck til we got him home.

927
01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:34.288
Oh boy, that's all I need.
Crazy Ralph running around.

929
01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.998
Well, the rain's stopping.
(Steve sighs)

930
01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.586
It was a pisser while it lasted.

931
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.921
[Dispatch] Sergeant Tierney, come in.

932
01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:43.256
Sergeant Tierney, car niner.

933
01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.173
This is Tierney.

934
01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:52.132
[Dispatch] Rescue squad with jaws of life
near mile marker 17, possible fatals.

936
01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:54.725
Three, maybe more, trapped. Head on.

937
01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.219
Roger, acknowledge receipt.

938
01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:57.846
Estimated arrival 15 minutes.

939
01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:02.063
(engine rumbling)

940
01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.492
- I'll have to let you out here, Steve.
- Sure.

942
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.284
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

944
01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:19.080
(engine rumbling)

945
01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:23.629
(sirens wailing)

946
01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:32.264
(crickets chirping)

947
01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.678
(Ioons calling)

948
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.531
(dramatic music)

949
01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:54.538
Hello?

950
01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.788
Who is that?

951
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:59.282
(eerie music)

952
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:05.589
0h, hi. What are you doing
out in this mess?

954
01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:08.254
(dramatic music)

955
01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:13.221
(frogs croaking)
(Ioons calling)

956
01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:20.353
(engine rumbling)

957
01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:43.084
(frogs croaking)

958
01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:50.709
(metal clattering)

959
01:04:58.353 --> 01:05:01.220
(lighter clicking)

960
01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.858
(fire rustling)

961
01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:16.200
(match sizzling)

962
01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:29.213
- [Alice] What do you think happened?
- [Bill] I don't know.

964
01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.255
Generator's probably out of gas.

965
01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.677
I'm going to check it.

966
01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.348
[Alice] Do you want me to come with you?

967
01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:43.436
Why don't you stay here
and try and get some sleep?

968
01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.389
(Alice groans)
I'll be right back.

969
01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:48.938
(tarp rustles)

970
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.866
(light dramatic music)

971
01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:00.283
(door thuds)

972
01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:15.089
(Ioons calling)

973
01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.716
(frogs croaking)

974
01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:24.515
(ground rustling)

975
01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:30.601
(door squeaking)

976
01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:40.068
(tarp rustling)

977
01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:56.961
(metal clanging)

978
01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:19.525
(sighs) Not gas.

979
01:07:28.419 --> 01:07:30.580
(suspenseful music)

980
01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:33.295
(metal clanging)

981
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:56.568
Bill?

982
01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:00.566
(frogs croaking)

983
01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:03.693
(Alice sighs)

984
01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:04.705
Generator.

985
01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:09.032
(Alice sighs)

986
01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:20.510
(thudding)

987
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:27.808
(match rustling)

988
01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:31.228
(gas hissing)

989
01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:55.461
(metal clinking)

990
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:20.107
(door squeaks)

991
01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:45.966
(tapping)

992
01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:06.232
(Alice sighs)

993
01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:07.074
(frogs croaking)

994
01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:07.817
Bill!

995
01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.159
Bill!

996
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:15.454
Bill!

997
01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.333
Bill!

998
01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:21.873
Bill?

999
01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:26.427
(suspenseful music)

1000
01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:27.216
Bill?

1001
01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:29.797
Bill?

1002
01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:36.475
(tarp rustling)

1003
01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:43.398
Bill?

1004
01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:48.570
Bill!

1005
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.081
(door squeaks)

1006
01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.871
(Alice screams)
(dark dramatic music)

1007
01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:58.664
No, Bill!

1008
01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:02.914
(dramatic music)
No, no!

1009
01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:07.885
(intense music)
(Alice screams)

1010
01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:27.029
(door thuds)
(Alice panting)

1011
01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:30.533
(suspenseful music)

1012
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:38.040
(Alice whimpers)

1013
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.082
(light dramatic music)

1014
01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:51.383
(heavy breathing)

1015
01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:53.176
Oh my god.

1016
01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:04.021
(heavy breathing)

1017
01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:10.865
(light dramatic music)

1018

1022
01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:57.995
(heavy breathing)
(light dramatic music)

1023
01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:30.862
(suspenseful music)

1024
01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:50.255
(metal clanging)

1025
01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:53.710
(clattering)

1026
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.932
(suspenseful music)

1027
01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.977
(Ioons calling)

1028
01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:11.988
Oh God.

1029
01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:14.522
What am I gonna do?

1030
01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.323
(dramatic music)
(glass shattering)

1031
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:24.290

1036
01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:11.294
(dramatic music)

1037
01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:15.666
(engine rumbling)
Steve.

1038
01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:18.669
(eerie music)

1039
01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:21.047
(clattering)

1040
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.805
Steve, oh, Steve!

1041
01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:32.854
(dramatic music)

1042
01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:33.817
Who are you?

1043
01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.192
Oh, thank you, I'm so glad-

1044
01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.285
Oh, no, no, no, no.
(muffled talking)

1045
01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:46.997
Dear, dear, now look, I can't help
you if you don't calm down.

1047
01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:51.540
She's dead and he's dead and
oh my god, poor Bill, oh god.

1048
01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.583
All right, all right, all right.
Come on, dear, then show me.

1050
01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:56.340
- No, no.
- No, but it's all right.

1052
01:15:56.343 --> 01:15:59.460
I'll take care of you, I used
to work for the Christys.

1053
01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:02.297
- Oh god, what's going on here?
- Please help me get out of here.

1055
01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:07.093
- It's just this place and the storm, that's why you're upset.
- No, no, no,

1057
01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:09.603
They're all dead. They're all dead.

1059
01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:12.894
- All right, all right, I'll go look.
- No, no, please don't leave me.

1061
01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.233
They'll kill you, too.

1062
01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:16.727
(laughs)
I'm not afraid.

1063
01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:19.446
(frogs croaking)

1064
01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:25.115
(clattering)

1065
01:16:30.294 --> 01:16:33.001
(door thuds)

1066
01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:35.121
(Mrs. Voorhees gasps)

1067
01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.293
Oh my lord.

1068
01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:42.382
So young, so pretty.

1069
01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:46.390
Oh, what monster could have done this?

1070
01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:49.302
Bill's out there.

1071
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:52.930
Oh, god, this place.

1072
01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:59.186
Steve should never have opened this place again,
there's been too much trouble here.

1074
01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:03.448
Did you know that a young boy drowned?

1075
01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.864
The year before those
two others were killed.

1076
01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:08.613
The counselors weren't
paying any attention,

1077
01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.457
they were making love while
that young boy drowned.

1078
01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:15.328
His name was Jason.

1079
01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:22.377
I was working the day that it happened,
preparing meals here.

1081
01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:24.174
I was the cook.

1082
01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:27.423
Jason should've been watched every minute!

1083
01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:28.344
He was...

1084
01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:34.017
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

1085
01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.855
We can go now, dear.

1086
01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:41.896
I think we should wait for Mr. Christy.

1087
01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:44.740
[Mrs. Voorhees] (laughs)
That's not necessary.

1088
01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.367
I don't understand.

1089
01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:48.827
(eerie music)

1090
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:52.239
[Young Jason] Help me!
Help! Help, Mommy!

1092
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:56.367
Help! Help, Mommy!

1093
01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:59.127
- Mommy, help!
- I am, Jason.

1094
01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:01.590
I am.

1095
01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.801
- Help, help me!
- Oh god.

1096
01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:08.764
You see? Jason is my son
and today is his birthday.

1097
01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:11.763
Where's Mr. Christy?

1098
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.768
Oh, I couldn't let them open
this place again. Could I?

1100
01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:19.775
Not after what happened.

1101
01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:28.993
Oh, my sweet innocent Jason.
(water splashing)

1102
01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:30.327
My only child.

1103
01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:36.410
Jason.
(water splashing)

1104
01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.785
(ominous music)

1105
01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:41.880
You let him drown, you
never paid any attention!

1106
01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.465
(clattering)

1107
01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:46.085
Look what you did to him.

1108
01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:48.938
- Look what you did to him!
- No, no.

1109
01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:52.094
(suspenseful music)

1110
01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:57.062

(ground rustling)

1121
01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:54.607
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

1122
01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:58.832
(ground rustling)

1123
01:19:58.836 --> 01:20:02.579
Don't let her get away, Mommy.
Don't let her live.

1124
01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:07.876
I won't, Jason. I won't.

1125
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:15.224
(light dramatic music)

1126
01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:17.843

God damn bullets.

1134
01:21:01.648 --> 01:21:02.648
Oh.

1135
01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:05.770
(smacking)

1136

(door rattling)
(light dramatic music)

1137
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.867
Come, dear. It'll be easier for
you than it was for Jason.

1139
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.366
(eerie music)

1140
01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.287
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

1141

(suspenseful music)

1142
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.420
Kill her.

Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

1158

She can't hide.
No place to hide.

1160
01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.363
Get her, Mommy. Get her.

1161

[Woman] Dr. Villas, wanted in surgery.

1211
01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:23.717
Dr. Villas, wanted in surgery.

1212
01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:24.843
- Okay.
- Okay.

1213
01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:34.273
Your folks are on the way up.

1214
01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:39.115
Is anyone else alive?

1215
01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:44.738
- Are they all dead?
- Yes, ma'am.

1217
01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:50.335
Two of my men pulled you out of the lake.
We thought you were dead, too.

1219
01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:53.789
Do you remember very much?

1220
01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:57.717
The boy, is he dead too?

1221
01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:01.512
- Who?
- The boy. Jason.

1223
01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:06.468
- Jason?
- In the lake.

1225
01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:09.604
The one who attacked me, the one who
pulled me underneath the water.

1227
01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:14.601
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

1228
01:32:17.574 --> 01:32:18.359
But...

1229
01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:27.284
Then he's still there.

1230
01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:34.754
(light dramatic music)
