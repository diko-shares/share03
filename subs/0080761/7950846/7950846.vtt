00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.540
<i>Know I love you, dear,
know I love you</i>

2
00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:51.716
<i>Angels in heaven
know I love you</i>

3
00:00:55.389 --> 00:01:00.350
<i>Down in the valley,
the valley so low</i>

4
00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:08.646
<i>Hang your head over,
hear the winds blow</i>

5
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.045
<i>The river of Jordan
is deep and wide</i>

6
00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:15.212
<i>Hallelujah</i>

7
00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:19.337
<i>Milk and honey on the side</i>

8
00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:21.715
<i>Hallelujah</i>

9
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.685
Where's Jay?

10
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.352
How long were those
potatoes under the fire?

11
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.445
How'd you do that?

12
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.526
<i>Hang down your head,
Tom Dooley</i>

13
00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:45.074
<i>Hang down your head and cry</i>

14
00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:48.370
<i>Hang down your head,
Tom Dooley</i>

15
00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:49.708
Somebody will see!

16
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.122
No way.

17
00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.627
Does Maryann kiss as good as I do?

18
00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:00.469
How would I know?

19
00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:01.462
Oh, you.

20
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:02.258
Come on.

21
00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.860
You said we were special.

22
00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.604
I meant everything.

23
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.576
That's not allowed.

24
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.070
Come on.

25
00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:15.377
Come on.

26
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.872
A man is not made out of stone.

27
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.672
Somebody's there!

28
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.730
We weren't doing anything.

29
00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:36.815
We were just messing...

30
00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.988
Please, don't!

31
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.739
No!

32
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:19.848
Hi, girl.

33
00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:20.891
Excuse me!

34
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:21.980
Hi, boy.

35
00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.439
You speak English?

36
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.025
How far is it to Camp Crystal Lake?

37
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:27.694
That far, huh?

38
00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:28.562
Okey-dokey.

39
00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:29.688
See you later.

40
00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:44.203
It's 07:01 on
Friday the 13th of June.

41
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.579
This is Big Dave and it's time

42
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.128
for you lazybones to get out of bed.

43
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:51.342
It's black-cat day in Crystal Lake.

44
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.521
I must have seen that Kojak 82 times.

45
00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.355
Excuse me.

46
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.474
How far is Camp Crystal Lake
from here?

47
00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.357
What is it, Enos?

48
00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.324
About 20 miles?

49
00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.326
About that.

50
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.364
Camp Blood?

51
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:19.659
They're opening that place again?

52
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.452
Lots of luck.

53
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.416
Can I get a bus or something?

54
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.660
Not likely.

55
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:27.288
You going out to the crossroads, Enos?

56
00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.459
What about a lift?

57
00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.207
That'd be halfway.

58
00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.174
No sweat, Trudy.

59
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.712
Okay, kid, let's move it.

60
00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.134
Name's Annie.

61
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.552
All right, Annie, let's go.

62
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.518
All the girls up there
gonna look as good as you?

63
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.734
I don't know.

64
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.487
You're going to Camp Blood, ain't ya?

65
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.197
Goddamn it, Ralph, get out of here!

66
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.031
Go on, get!

67
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:57.072
Leave people alone!

68
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:58.819
You'll never come back again!

69
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.945
Oh, shut up, Ralph!

70
00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.866
It's got a death curse!

71
00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.254
He's a real prophet of doom, ain't he?

72
00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.416
Come on, climb up, miss.

73
00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:33.270
I tell you, he's causing
problems enough for your boss

74
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.316
with all that talk.

75
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.442
Goddamn nuisance.

76
00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:04.927
He tell you anything?

77
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.936
Who?

78
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.146
Your boss.

79
00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:09.639
Steve Christy.

80
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.188
I'll be cooking for
50 kids and 10 staff.

81
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.655
Campers will mostly be
like inner-city children.

82
00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:21.573
No, I mean about what happened.

83
00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:23.282
No.

84
00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:30.168
Come on.

85
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.128
There's something you're not telling me.

86
00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:35.423
Quit.

87
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:36.837
Quit now.

88
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.051
Quit?

89
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.215
Why would I want to quit?

90
00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.963
Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed!

91
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.220
Oh, terrific.

92
00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.217
Not you too.

93
00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.686
You sound like your crazy
friend back there, Ralph.

94
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:48.975
Well, maybe.

95
00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:51.815
Did Christy tell you about
the two kids murdered in '58?

96
00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.068
Boy drowning in '57?

97
00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:57.528
A bunch of fires?

98
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.698
Nobody knows who did any of them.

99
00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.114
In 1962, they was gonna open up.

100
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.236
The water was bad.

101
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.783
Christy will end up just like
his folks, crazy and broke.

102
00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.410
He's been up there a year
fixing up that place.

103
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.583
Must have dropped $25,000.

104
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.705
And for what?

105
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.668
Ask anybody.

106
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:19.463
Quit!

107
00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:21.507
I can't.

108
00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.135
Dumb kids.

109
00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:25.007
Know-it-alls.

110
00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:27.555
Just like my nieces.

111
00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.893
Heads full of rocks.

112
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.477
You're an American original.

113
00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:33.939
I'm an American original.

114
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:36.735
Dumb kid.

115
00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:39.821
At least I'm not afraid of ghosts.

116
00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.925
Take care of yourself, kid.

117
00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:04.763
No sweat.

118
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:05.847
Thanks a lot for the lift.

119
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.882
Hey, Marcie.

120
00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:42.592
You really think there'll be
other gorgeous women

121
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.461
at Camp Crystal Lake besides yourself?

122
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:47.589
Is sex all you ever think about, Ned?

123
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.431
Hey, no.

124
00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.265
No.

125
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.134
Absolutely not.

126
00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:53.687
Sometimes I just think
about kissing women.

127
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:57.875
You wanna give me
a hand over here?

128
00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:58.664
Sure.

129
00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:01.667
Alice!

130
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.715
I wanna get this tree stump out.

131
00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.709
Get on this side, you pull on that side.

132
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.551
And I'll pull it.

133
00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.385
On three, okay?

134
00:14:07.388 --> 00:14:08.219
Alice!

135
00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.053
Coming.

136
00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:14.013
That's great, that's great.

137
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.851
I'm Steve Christy.

138
00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:15.685
Jack.

139
00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:16.723
Marcie.

140
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:17.562
This is Marcie,
I'm Ned Rubinstein.

141
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.396
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.

142
00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.230
Thanks you.

143
00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.143
This is Alice.

144
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:20.982
Hi.

145
00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.692
Steve, Cabin B is all ready.

146
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:23.526
Listen, where's Bill?

147
00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:25.315
Is he finished cleaning
off the boathouse yet?

148
00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:26.154
I don't know.

149
00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.488
I haven't seen him
in the past half hour.

150
00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:29.028
I wanted him to start
painting right away.

151
00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:29.991
What about Brenda?

152
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.576
You told her to go set
up the archery range.

153
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.035
No, I'd rather she paint.

154
00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:33.824
Well, come on.

155
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.196
Let's go.

156
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.199
I thought we had two weeks.

157
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.041
Come on.

158
00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:39.500
I'll show you where you can get changed.

159
00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:40.335
Okay.

160
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.092
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

161
00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:51.839
Thank you.

162
00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.478
You got it?

163
00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:25.998
You draw very well.

164
00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:29.342
Thanks.

165
00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:30.506
I wish I had more time to do it.

166
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.425
Oh, dummy.

167
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.762
When did you do this?

168
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:37.804
Last night.

169
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.017
Do I really look like that?

170
00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:43.731
You did last night.

171
00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.523
You're very talented.

172
00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.652
You're very pretty.

173
00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.456
This really isn't your cup of tea, is it?

174
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.167
Any particular reason?

175
00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.124
It's just a problem I have.

176
00:16:06.132 --> 00:16:07.213
It's nothing personal.

177
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.756
You wanna leave?

178
00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:13.594
I don't know.

179
00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:14.429
I may have to go back to California

180
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:15.672
to straighten something out.

181
00:16:20.021 --> 00:16:20.806
Come on.

182
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.096
Give me another chance.

183
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.106
Stay a week.

184
00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.565
Help get the place ready.

185
00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:29.857
By Friday, if you're not happy,

186
00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.281
I'll put you on the bus myself.

187
00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.283
All right.

188
00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:36.401
Friday.

189
00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:38.028
I'll give it a week.

190
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:45.956
Thanks, Alice.

191
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:02.560
Bill?

192
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.975
Steve wants to know if we need more paint.

193
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.143
Paint's all right.

194
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.231
Think we need some more thinner though.

195
00:17:07.235 --> 00:17:08.725
Okay, I'll tell him.

196
00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:09.771
Alice.

197
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:10.735
Did the others show up?

198
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:11.819
Yeah, everybody except that girl

199
00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:14.109
that's supposed to handle
the kitchen, Annie.

200
00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:15.527
Think you're
gonna last all summer?

201
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.446
I don't know if I'm gonna last all week.

202
00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.536
I'll tell Steve about the thinner.

203
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.247
Fine.

204
00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.383
You want it listed separately?

205
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.222
That's right.

206
00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.135
And, after lunch, Brenda,

207
00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:41.803
I want you to finish up the archery range.

208
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:42.642
Okay?

209
00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.763
Now if Annie gets here,
get her started in the kitchen.

210
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.434
Do your best, all right?

211
00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:49.603
I'll be back sometime after lunch.

212
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.475
It's supposed to rain like hell,

213
00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:51.726
so get as much done as possible.

214
00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.353
I don't wanna get too far behind.

215
00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:57.944
Bye.

216
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:02.074
He neglected to mention that downtown

217
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:04.038
they call this place Camp Blood.

218
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:06.207
Next you're gonna tell us

219
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.292
there are poisonous snakes
in the outhouse

220
00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:09.661
and crocodiles in the lake.

221
00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:11.959
No, the crocodiles
are in the cabins.

222
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.610
Ta-da!

223
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:42.614
Are you crazy?

224
00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:45.121
Wanna see my trick shot?

225
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:45.955
It's even better.

226
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:50.455
I don't believe you!

227
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:57.417
You know, you're beautiful
when you're angry, sweetheart.

228
00:18:57.428 --> 00:18:58.509
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

229
00:18:58.512 --> 00:18:59.752
Did you come up

230
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.721
here to help me or scare me to death?

231
00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:04.341
You do that again, I'm gonna
tack you up on the wall to dry.

232
00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.218
I love that sexy talk!

233
00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:32.540
Hi.

234
00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:33.786
I'm going to Camp Crystal Lake.

235
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.017
Guess I always wanted
to work with children.

236
00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:53.890
I hate when people call them kids.

237
00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:56.268
Sounds like little goats.

238
00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:58.269
But when you've had a
dream as long as I have,

239
00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.190
you'll do anything.

240
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.384
Hey, wasn't that the road for
Camp Crystal Lake back there?

241
00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:34.101
I think we better stop.

242
00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:38.025
Please?

243
00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:41.987
Stop, please!

244
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.031
Please!

245
00:20:44.034 --> 00:20:44.774
Stop!

246
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:46.780
Please, stop!

247
00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.208
No.

248
00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:36.637
All right, move it out, move it out.

249
00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:38.638
Okay, a little to the left.

250
00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:40.390
Now, now, no, no, no.

251
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:43.109
Let's go.

252
00:22:43.112 --> 00:22:44.022
Okay, okay.

253
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.019
Little to the left.

254
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.862
Okay, good good.

255
00:22:57.793 --> 00:23:00.626
Now if you were a flavor of
ice cream, what would it be?

256
00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:03.003
Rocky Road.

257
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:04.876
Hey!

258
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:21.306
What's that vitamin C
stuff do for you anyway?

259
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:23.024
Vitamin C is supposed to neutralize

260
00:23:23.027 --> 00:23:24.313
the nitrates or something.

261
00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:28.317
What's the matter?

262
00:23:28.324 --> 00:23:29.985
Do you see something?

263
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:33.951
No.

264
00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:34.739
Nothing.

265
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.833
Ned!

266
00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:42.702
Get out of here!

267
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.090
Hey, you guys.

268
00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:53.963
You ready to go back to work?

269
00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:54.759
Yeah.

270
00:23:58.604 --> 00:23:59.890
- Come on, Alice.
- Help!

271
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.521
Help!

272
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:03.605
Something's wrong with Ned.

273
00:24:05.903 --> 00:24:06.813
Let's get a life preserver!

274
00:24:18.582 --> 00:24:19.413
Help!

275
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.002
Jesus, where is he?

276
00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:25.836
Can he swim?

277
00:24:25.839 --> 00:24:26.670
I don't know.

278
00:24:26.674 --> 00:24:27.505
He's around here.

279
00:24:27.508 --> 00:24:28.714
He's right around here somewhere.

280
00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:29.878
I got it.

281
00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:31.922
Go ahead, dive for him.

282
00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:34.887
There he is!

283
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.721
There he is.

284
00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:36.555
Come you guys, help me.

285
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:37.923
Watch his head.

286
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.681
Careful.

287
00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:41.894
Okay.

288
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.606
Watch his head!

289
00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:47.850
Got him?

290
00:24:53.659 --> 00:24:54.569
Can you give mouth-to-mouth?

291
00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:55.361
Yeah.

292
00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:02.790
Oh, God.

293
00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:03.874
Come on, Ned.

294
00:25:03.877 --> 00:25:05.834
Hurry up, hurry up.

295
00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:06.953
Oh, Neddy!

296
00:25:06.964 --> 00:25:08.250
Oh, Jesus Christ!

297
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:15.674
Look, I'm sorry.

298
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:17.388
I'm sorry, all right?

299
00:25:51.175 --> 00:25:53.041
Bill!

300
00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:55.669
Bill, come here, quick!

301
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:56.464
Hurry!

302
00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:02.261
What is it?

303
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:05.432
There's a snake over there.

304
00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:06.224
Where?

305
00:26:14.073 --> 00:26:15.484
What do I do?

306
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:17.107
Kill it.

307
00:26:17.117 --> 00:26:18.607
It might bite.

308
00:26:18.619 --> 00:26:20.030
Haven't you ever been in the woods?

309
00:26:20.037 --> 00:26:21.277
We're not in the woods.

310
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:23.571
Jesus, Bill, what are you doing?

311
00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:24.492
There's a snake in here.

312
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.365
Why are we in here?

313
00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:27.332
Feet don't fail me now!

314
00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:28.326
There it is!

315
00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:33.623
I can't sleep with a snake in here.

316
00:26:33.634 --> 00:26:35.500
Nobody told us anything about snakes.

317
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:36.876
Kill it!

318
00:26:36.887 --> 00:26:38.048
You heard the lady.

319
00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:39.136
I can't get it until it comes out.

320
00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:41.050
Well, call him!

321
00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:42.594
How do you call a snake?

322
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:43.511
I'll flush him!

323
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.982
I got it.

324
00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:52.816
Where?

325
00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.685
Look out!

326
00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:54.526
I got him!

327
00:26:58.659 --> 00:26:59.490
Oh, God.

328
00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:06.114
Is it dead?

329
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:09.955
Either that or
it's got a very short clone.

330
00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:12.040
Oh God.

331
00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:15.130
Well, at least we know
what's for dinner.

332
00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:16.841
- Oh, gross.
- Marcie!

333
00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:22.592
I'm making salad.

334
00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:24.135
Want me to go ahead and
make some for everybody?

335
00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:25.008
That'd be great.

336
00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:26.508
I think we got some
hamburger in there too.

337
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.931
None for me, thank you.

338
00:27:27.938 --> 00:27:28.769
There are apples.

339
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:30.354
Know how to make apple pie?

340
00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:31.142
Sure.

341
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.140
No sweat.

342
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:32.936
What is going on?

343
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:44.906
Oh, shit.

344
00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:48.993
All right, who are you people?

345
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:50.366
Camp counselors.

346
00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:51.788
Ned is just fooling around.

347
00:27:51.795 --> 00:27:52.751
Yeah, right, I'm just...

348
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:54.119
Can it, Cochise.

349
00:27:54.131 --> 00:27:55.246
Steve Christy hire you people?

350
00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:56.880
He pay you for this?

351
00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:57.715
Hey, nice bike.

352
00:27:57.718 --> 00:27:58.924
What you been smoking, boy?

353
00:27:58.927 --> 00:27:59.758
Smoking?

354
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:00.592
Don't smoke.

355
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:01.427
Causes cancer.

356
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:02.261
You know what I mean.

357
00:28:02.264 --> 00:28:03.550
What'd you just get off
a spaceship or something?

358
00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:04.672
Colombian gold, man.

359
00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:06.219
Grass, hash, the weed.

360
00:28:06.226 --> 00:28:07.466
Dig it?

361
00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:08.387
Hey, what's he talking about?

362
00:28:08.395 --> 00:28:09.556
Hey, don't get smart.

363
00:28:09.563 --> 00:28:10.394
Me?

364
00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:11.262
I'm as dumb as they come.

365
00:28:11.273 --> 00:28:12.479
Hey.

366
00:28:12.482 --> 00:28:13.643
Not another word out of you,
you understand me?

367
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.233
Officer, officer, really,
nothing's going on here.

368
00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:17.852
We're just trying to
get the place in shape.

369
00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:18.853
In shape for what?

370
00:28:18.864 --> 00:28:20.446
Officer, is there
anything we can do to help?

371
00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:21.655
We'd be glad to help out.

372
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:23.069
I'm looking for somebody.

373
00:28:23.076 --> 00:28:24.111
And who's that?

374
00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:25.359
A guy named Ralph.

375
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.111
The town crazy.

376
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:29.489
Well, there's no crazy people around here.

377
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.911
I told you to sit on it, Tonto.

378
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:35.335
I got word that Ralph was
pedaling out this way,

379
00:28:35.339 --> 00:28:36.329
spouting his gospel.

380
00:28:37.341 --> 00:28:38.752
We haven't seen anybody here, officer.

381
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:39.874
Just us.

382
00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:41.922
This guy Ralph, is he dangerous?

383
00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:45.429
Every time that loony gets drunk,
he gets his calling.

384
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:46.763
I end up spending the morning in court

385
00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:48.257
and he gets a week in jail.

386
00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:50.142
Cycle Two, where are you?

387
00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:51.806
Come in, Cycle Two.

388
00:28:51.813 --> 00:28:53.770
Cycle Two.

389
00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:54.605
This is Dorf.

390
00:28:54.608 --> 00:28:55.598
I'm out here at Camp Crystal Lake.

391
00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:56.974
Over.

392
00:28:56.985 --> 00:28:58.066
Haul it back in, Dorf.

393
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.607
Chief wants you back
in town on the double.

394
00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:01.445
Roger that.

395
00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:02.279
10-4.

396
00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:03.067
On my way.

397
00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:05.567
Out.

398
00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:06.942
Never keep the chief waiting.

399
00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:13.282
You kids keep your noses
clean, you understand?

400
00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:14.875
You'll be hearing from me if you don't.

401
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.339
We ain't gonna stand for
no weirdness out here.

402
00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:09.088
I'm the messenger of God.

403
00:30:09.099 --> 00:30:11.306
You're doomed if you stay here.

404
00:30:14.896 --> 00:30:16.603
This place is cursed.

405
00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:17.391
Cursed.

406
00:30:20.402 --> 00:30:21.642
It's got a death curse.

407
00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:23.644
Who are you?

408
00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:24.440
What do you want?

409
00:30:25.866 --> 00:30:27.982
God sent me.

410
00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:29.074
Get out of here, man!

411
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.326
I got to warn you.

412
00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:33.658
You're doomed if you stay.

413
00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:37.874
Go.

414
00:30:37.878 --> 00:30:38.663
Go!

415
00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:52.097
I think we just met Ralph.

416
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.182
God, what's next?

417
00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:07.362
You're doomed.

418
00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:08.777
You're all doomed.

419
00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:36.968
Who likes 'em rare?

420
00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:37.809
Me.

421
00:31:37.813 --> 00:31:38.974
How can you guys eat that stuff?

422
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.891
It looks like dead animals.

423
00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:41.730
Dead animals?

424
00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:42.848
That's the old counselors.

425
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:44.020
You cannibals!

426
00:31:44.027 --> 00:31:45.938
If you would mix all this stuff right,

427
00:31:45.946 --> 00:31:47.687
you'd get all the protein you need.

428
00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:48.778
Too bad Annie never showed up.

429
00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:50.318
She was supposed to be quite a good cook.

430
00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:52.612
Well, don't expect me
to play chef for you guys.

431
00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:54.405
The squaws are revolting.

432
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:56.032
Trouble?

433
00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:58.121
Yeah, a bad bulb or no power.

434
00:31:58.125 --> 00:32:00.287
It seems a little gloomy in here.

435
00:32:00.293 --> 00:32:02.751
Steve taught me how to
use the emergency generator.

436
00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.916
Town power lines are
supposed to be real lousy.

437
00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:07.005
God, don't you love that macho talk?

438
00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:08.464
Emergency generator.

439
00:32:08.468 --> 00:32:10.084
Wanna give me a hand with this?

440
00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:11.051
Yeah, let's do it.

441
00:32:11.054 --> 00:32:12.385
Wait for me.

442
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:13.720
Neddy, can you watch the burgers?

443
00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:15.009
Sure.

444
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:16.006
Burn them.

445
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.016
Wanna heat these?

446
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:18.804
Yeah.

447
00:32:20.564 --> 00:32:22.475
You really think he's going
to be bent out of shape?

448
00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:23.643
I don't know.

449
00:32:24.568 --> 00:32:25.933
Hey, this looks almost like the one

450
00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:28.777
at my uncle's cabin in Maine.

451
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.861
Well, here goes.

452
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:31.355
What an antique.

453
00:32:40.709 --> 00:32:42.996
Well, what hath God wrought?

454
00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:05.333
Hello?

455
00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:16.677
Can I help you?

456
00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:20.801
Hello?

457
00:34:21.977 --> 00:34:22.762
Hello?

458
00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:25.560
Come on.

459
00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:27.271
Coming, I'm coming.

460
00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:32.605
Oh, wind's come up.

461
00:34:32.612 --> 00:34:34.319
Shifted a good 180 degrees.

462
00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:38.282
Makes me wanna hold onto you.

463
00:34:42.539 --> 00:34:43.995
What about Ned?

464
00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:45.239
I don't love Ned.

465
00:34:46.126 --> 00:34:48.538
He keeps acting like such a jerk.

466
00:34:48.545 --> 00:34:49.376
Neddy!

467
00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:50.244
Stop.

468
00:34:50.255 --> 00:34:51.711
Don't call him.

469
00:34:51.715 --> 00:34:52.921
I thought you wanted to give him

470
00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.335
one of your motherly lectures.

471
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:55.377
Look, Neddy's going to do

472
00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:57.592
whatever Neddy wants to do,
you know?

473
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:00.178
It's gonna storm.

474
00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:03.970
Can tear down that valley
like a son of a gun.

475
00:35:03.977 --> 00:35:05.012
I've been afraid of storms

476
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.602
ever since I was a little kid.

477
00:35:06.605 --> 00:35:07.436
No.

478
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:08.224
Really?

479
00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:09.938
Yeah.

480
00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:11.807
I've had this dream
about five or six times

481
00:35:11.818 --> 00:35:13.434
where I'm in a thunderstorm...

482
00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:16.479
And it's raining really hard.

483
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.408
It sounds like pebbles
when it hits the ground.

484
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:22.276
I can hear it.

485
00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:25.992
I try to block out the sound
with my hands,

486
00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:27.285
only it doesn't work.

487
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:29.249
It just keeps getting louder and louder.

488
00:35:31.504 --> 00:35:32.289
And then

489
00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.830
the rain turns to blood

490
00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:41.091
and the blood washes
away in little rivers.

491
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.556
And then the sound stops.

492
00:35:47.771 --> 00:35:48.806
It's just a dream.

493
00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:51.020
Yeah, I know.

494
00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:53.436
I call it my shower dream.

495
00:35:54.277 --> 00:35:55.062
Hey, hey.

496
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.276
This is no dream.

497
00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:57.895
Come on, we're going to get soaked.

498
00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:01.769
Jack and Marcie are gonna get drenched.

499
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.612
Not if they're where I think they are.

500
00:38:30.475 --> 00:38:31.590
That's nice.

501
00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:33.266
Hey.

502
00:38:33.269 --> 00:38:34.384
I know what we can do.

503
00:38:34.395 --> 00:38:35.931
We're going to play Monopoly.

504
00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:37.555
I hate Monopoly!

505
00:38:37.565 --> 00:38:39.932
Not the way I play it, you don't.

506
00:38:39.943 --> 00:38:40.808
Like what?

507
00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:42.776
We're going to play strip Monopoly.

508
00:38:42.779 --> 00:38:44.315
I'll be the shoe.

509
00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:46.404
You have got to be kidding.

510
00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:49.070
What about if Steve walks in?

511
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:50.488
We'll give him a handicap.

512
00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:51.360
He can keep his boots on.

513
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:52.657
Everything else goes.

514
00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:53.529
It's easy.

515
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.872
Instead of paying rent, you pay clothes.

516
00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:57.240
Bill can be banker.

517
00:38:57.252 --> 00:38:59.584
Unless, of course, he's chicken.

518
00:38:59.587 --> 00:39:02.249
Well, heaven help you
if you land in one of my hotels.

519
00:39:02.257 --> 00:39:04.840
Why don't you see if Marcie
left any of that grass.

520
00:39:06.678 --> 00:39:07.509
What happened to my 500s?

521
00:39:07.512 --> 00:39:08.843
They're right there.

522
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:10.429
Where's my shoe?

523
00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:22.872
I'm not gonna pass Go without a glow.

524
00:40:22.879 --> 00:40:23.960
We already rolled for you.

525
00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:25.499
You're going last, okay?

526
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:28.373
Oh, and Community Chest cannot
give you your clothes back.

527
00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.425
Double sixes.

528
00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:32.919
I get to roll again.

529
00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.463
I think we're being hustled.

530
00:40:35.475 --> 00:40:37.341
I think you're right.

531
00:40:41.356 --> 00:40:42.221
You are so fine.

532
00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:52.693
Yo, yo, yo, where you going?

533
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.656
I gotta pee.

534
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.695
You're lying on my bladder.

535
00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:00.238
Hurry back, okay?

536
00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:02.870
It's getting cold in here.

537
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:14.761
You'll save my place for me?

538
00:41:14.764 --> 00:41:15.629
Oh, yeah.

539
00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:35.194
Five.

540
00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:38.280
Baltic Avenue.

541
00:41:38.287 --> 00:41:39.277
I'll buy it.

542
00:41:39.288 --> 00:41:41.120
No one ever lands on Baltic Avenue.

543
00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:42.910
I think it's a pretty color.

544
00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:43.702
Okay.

545
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.455
Come on.

546
00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:48.878
Eight.

547
00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:51.998
Baltic Avenue.

548
00:41:54.095 --> 00:41:55.210
You owe me one boot.

549
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:56.052
Coming.

550
00:41:56.055 --> 00:41:58.467
Alice draws first blood.

551
00:41:58.474 --> 00:42:00.715
That's a terrible way
to talk about my feet.

552
00:42:00.727 --> 00:42:01.512
Thank you.

553
00:42:02.562 --> 00:42:03.427
Who's next?

554
00:42:05.606 --> 00:42:08.769
You know, I think
I'm beginning to like this game.

555
00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:11.313
Just wait until he lands
on my old Kentucky home.

556
00:42:12.405 --> 00:42:13.236
More beer?

557
00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:14.354
More beer.

558
00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:16.322
Let's see, a railroad...

559
00:44:12.859 --> 00:44:15.897
40 Yards to the Outhouse,
by Willie Makit.

560
00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.696
Come on, kids,
you can do better than that.

561
00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:23.570
Jack?

562
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.452
Jack?

563
00:44:36.174 --> 00:44:36.959
Jack?

564
00:44:46.142 --> 00:44:47.473
When I looked into that mirror,

565
00:44:47.476 --> 00:44:49.308
I knew I'd always be ugly.

566
00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:52.762
I said, Lizzie,

567
00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.602
you'll always be plain.

568
00:45:00.448 --> 00:45:01.938
Hello?

569
00:45:39.237 --> 00:45:40.568
Ned?

570
00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:46.233
Hey, come on, you guys.

571
00:46:12.478 --> 00:46:14.060
Ollie-ollie-in-free!

572
00:46:31.414 --> 00:46:33.280
Must be my imagination.

573
00:46:51.017 --> 00:46:52.348
- Hello.
- Shit.

574
00:46:52.351 --> 00:46:54.718
Worst run of bad luck since Richard Nixon.

575
00:46:54.729 --> 00:46:56.595
Well, you can always call
it quits if you want to.

576
00:46:56.605 --> 00:46:57.470
Fat chance!

577
00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:00.769
You're two steps from
Pacific Avenue and Skin City.

578
00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:07.859
Whoops.

579
00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:09.615
Well, what can I say?

580
00:47:09.618 --> 00:47:11.029
It's not much, but I call it home.

581
00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.363
Oh, no!

582
00:47:15.374 --> 00:47:16.159
Wait a minute.

583
00:47:16.167 --> 00:47:16.998
I'll get it, I'll get it.

584
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:19.117
Get the money.

585
00:47:19.128 --> 00:47:19.959
God!

586
00:47:19.962 --> 00:47:21.669
It's blowing like crazy out there.

587
00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:23.959
I think I left the windows
in my cabin open.

588
00:47:23.966 --> 00:47:24.751
Shoot!

589
00:47:28.429 --> 00:47:30.090
Well, we're going to have to finish

590
00:47:30.097 --> 00:47:31.963
this game some other night.

591
00:47:31.974 --> 00:47:33.806
Just when it was getting interesting.

592
00:47:35.478 --> 00:47:36.764
See you guys in the morning.

593
00:47:36.771 --> 00:47:38.432
See you.

594
00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:39.474
Good night.

595
00:47:39.482 --> 00:47:40.517
Good night.

596
00:47:48.741 --> 00:47:50.231
Look at this mess.

597
00:47:50.242 --> 00:47:51.448
Here.

598
00:47:51.452 --> 00:47:53.989
Hey, tell me, were you really
going to go ahead with it?

599
00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:56.033
Actually, I hadn't made up my mind.

600
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.030
Well, in that case,

601
00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:57.997
we'll have to finish
the game another night.

602
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.661
Oh, yeah?

603
00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:19.344
Steve, is there anything else you want?

604
00:48:19.355 --> 00:48:20.140
No, no.

605
00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:20.978
No, thanks, Sandy.

606
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.096
I'm fine.

607
00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:24.224
You can't go back
out there in that rain.

608
00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:25.350
Do you wanna get drowned?

609
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:26.146
No, I've got to.

610
00:48:26.153 --> 00:48:28.861
I've got six new counselors up at camp.

611
00:48:28.864 --> 00:48:32.402
They are babes in the woods,
in every sense of the word.

612
00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:34.868
Well, they'll be okay
if they know enough

613
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.076
to come out of the rain.

614
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:38.992
Well, what do I owe you?

615
00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:40.785
Just a night on the town, Steve.

616
00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:43.580
Come on, how, Sandy,
you know what I mean.

617
00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:44.418
That's okay.

618
00:48:44.422 --> 00:48:45.662
Two and a quarter and that's it.

619
00:48:50.428 --> 00:48:51.213
Thank you.

620
00:49:04.442 --> 00:49:05.523
Here's your change, Steve.

621
00:49:05.526 --> 00:49:07.392
No, you keep it, Sandy.

622
00:49:07.403 --> 00:49:08.234
Thank you.

623
00:49:08.237 --> 00:49:09.022
Sure.

624
00:49:09.029 --> 00:49:09.860
Drive careful.

625
00:49:09.864 --> 00:49:10.729
I will.

626
00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:11.524
Good night.

627
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:38.736
Hi.

628
00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:39.604
Hi, Steve.

629
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:41.356
I thought that thing
would go through anything.

630
00:52:41.367 --> 00:52:42.857
Not dragging a trailer.

631
00:52:42.868 --> 00:52:44.074
Can you give me a lift?

632
00:52:44.078 --> 00:52:44.909
Yeah.

633
00:52:44.912 --> 00:52:45.743
I'll have one of my counselors

634
00:52:45.746 --> 00:52:46.986
bring me back in the morning.

635
00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:47.782
Why not?

636
00:54:09.538 --> 00:54:10.869
Help me!

637
00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:37.096
Help me!

638
00:55:06.512 --> 00:55:07.297
Hello?

639
00:55:11.558 --> 00:55:12.343
Hello?

640
00:55:13.435 --> 00:55:14.516
Over here!

641
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.478
Please, somebody, help me!

642
00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:18.266
Hello?

643
00:55:21.944 --> 00:55:22.775
Hello!

644
00:55:27.574 --> 00:55:28.359
Hello?

645
00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:34.949
Hello?

646
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.747
Come quickly, please!

647
00:55:43.757 --> 00:55:44.963
Come quickly!

648
00:55:44.967 --> 00:55:45.752
Help!

649
00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:02.097
Where are you?

650
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.894
Hello?

651
00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:24.624
Hello?

652
00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:32.590
All right.

653
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:38.308
Come on out, it's not funny anymore!

654
00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:42.270
It's not funny at all.

655
00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:47.498
Bill.

656
00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.755
Hi.

657
00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:52.090
Generator's okay.

658
00:57:52.094 --> 00:57:53.209
I thought I heard a scream.

659
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:55.382
How can you hear through that wind?

660
00:57:55.389 --> 00:57:56.675
It sounded like Brenda.

661
00:57:57.975 --> 00:57:59.056
I'd better take a look.

662
00:57:59.059 --> 00:58:00.390
Yeah, and somebody turned on the lights

663
00:58:00.394 --> 00:58:02.351
at the archery range.

664
00:58:02.354 --> 00:58:03.469
What?

665
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.430
I can't see anything.

666
00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:09.099
They're off now.

667
00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:11.898
I'm gonna check it out.

668
00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:16.274
Bill, can I come?

669
00:58:16.284 --> 00:58:17.399
Come on then.

670
00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.071
Brenda!

671
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:24.331
Brenda!

672
00:58:30.132 --> 00:58:30.917
Where is she?

673
00:58:33.677 --> 00:58:35.509
She must be with Jack and Marcie.

674
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:40.589
Alice?

675
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.840
Yeah?

676
00:58:41.852 --> 00:58:43.388
Come here.

677
00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:04.075
What is going on?

678
00:59:09.171 --> 00:59:10.536
Come on!

679
00:59:16.845 --> 00:59:18.381
Jack!

680
00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:19.219
Jack!

681
00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.008
Jack, open the door.

682
00:59:23.685 --> 00:59:25.426
Where are they?

683
00:59:25.437 --> 00:59:26.268
I don't know.

684
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:27.011
Come on.

685
00:59:32.444 --> 00:59:33.775
Brenda?

686
00:59:35.322 --> 00:59:36.062
Marcie?

687
00:59:37.991 --> 00:59:38.981
You guys?

688
00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:39.777
Jack?

689
00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:41.533
Neddy?

690
00:59:46.625 --> 00:59:48.457
Bill, I think we should call someone.

691
00:59:50.378 --> 00:59:52.540
If this is a joke,
I'm going to brain them.

692
00:59:52.547 --> 00:59:54.458
I'm serious.

693
00:59:54.466 --> 00:59:56.423
I really think we should call someone.

694
01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:08.139
The sucker's locked.

695
01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:09.432
Where's the key?

696
01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.395
I don't know.

697
01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:11.513
Wait a minute.

698
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.531
Watch out.

699
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.367
Be careful.

700
01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:31.659
Let me get the light.

701
01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:42.754
What's wrong?

702
01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:43.674
It's dead.

703
01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.468
Try the pay phone.

704
01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.887
Do you have a dime or a quarter?

705
01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.976
No, I'll check the desk.

706
01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.941
Hello?

707
01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.689
This damn thing's dead too!

708
01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.628
What's the matter with it?

709
01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:21.500
It's wet.

710
01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:23.218
I don't know.

711
01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:24.632
Why don't we just hike out of here,

712
01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:26.380
just get out, right now.

713
01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:29.349
Look, it's 10 miles to
the nearest crossroads.

714
01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:30.763
Steve will be back soon.

715
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.932
We can use his jeep if
we need to get help.

716
01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:34.600
Don't worry.

717
01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.474
There's probably some stupid
explanation for all this.

718
01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:38.225
Like what?

719
01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:40.694
We'll be laughing about
this tomorrow, I promise.

720
01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:47.992
Let's get out of this rain.

721
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.416
It's not bad enough
to have Friday the 13th,

722
01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.955
we've got a full moon too.

723
01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:58.123
We keep statistics.

724
01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:02.212
We have more accidents,
more rapes, more robberies,

725
01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.960
more homicides, more of everything

726
01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.631
when there's a full moon.

727
01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:06.879
It upsets people.

728
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.005
Makes them nuts.

729
01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:10.891
You make a science out of coincidence.

730
01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:15.725
I hear old Ralph was out your way today.

731
01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.807
His wife was a nervous
wreck till we got him home.

732
01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:19.683
Oh, boy.

733
01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:23.437
That's all I need,
Crazy Ralph running around.

734
01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.405
Well, the rain's stopping.

735
01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:28.488
It was a pisser while it lasted.

736
01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:29.701
Sergeant Tierney, come in.

737
01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:31.069
Sergeant Tierney, Car Niner.

738
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.956
This is Tierney.

739
01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.997
Rescue squad with Jaws of Life.

740
01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.493
Near mile marker 17.

741
01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:39.995
Possible fatals.

742
01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:41.542
Three, maybe more, trapped.

743
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:42.630
Head-on.

744
01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:43.465
Roger.

745
01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:44.299
Acknowledge receipt.

746
01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.168
Estimate arrival, 15 minutes.

747
01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.514
I have to let you off here, Steve.

748
01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.892
Sure, sure.

749
01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.358
Thanks.

750
01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:04.103
Good luck.

751
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:42.186
Hello?

752
01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.276
Who is that?

753
01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.898
Oh, hi.

754
01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:53.527
What are you doing out in this mess?

755
01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:16.534
What do you think happened?

756
01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:18.324
I don't know.

757
01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:21.081
Generator's probably out of gas.

758
01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:23.333
Better check it.

759
01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:27.246
You want me to come with you?

760
01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:31.299
Why don't you stay here
and try and get some sleep.

761
01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.632
I'll be right back.

762
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:06.186
Full of gas.

763
01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:42.468
Bill!

764
01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:44.595
Bill?

765
01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:52.561
Generator.

766
01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:56.226
Bill!

767
01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:00.230
Bill.

768
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:03.571
Bill?

769
01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:07.492
Bill.

770
01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:09.987
Bill?

771
01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:15.333
Bill.

772
01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:17.873
Bill?

773
01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:31.637
Bill?

774
01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:36.683
Bill!

775
01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:42.291
Oh my God.

776
01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:01.934
What am I gonna do?

777
01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:03.450
Steve.

778
01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.709
Steve, oh, Steve!

779
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.010
Who are you?

780
01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:26.978
Well, I'm Mrs. Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christys.

781
01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:30.268
No, no.

782
01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:32.103
There, there.

783
01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:34.523
Now, look, I can't help you
if you don't calm down.

784
01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:36.237
But she's dead and he's dead.

785
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.652
And, oh, my God, poor Bill!

786
01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:39.524
Oh, God!

787
01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:40.445
All right, all right, all right.

788
01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:41.784
Come on, dear, then show me.

789
01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:42.777
No, no.

790
01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.244
No, but it's all right.

791
01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:45.329
I'll take care of you.

792
01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:47.164
I used to work for the Christys.

793
01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:48.033
Oh, God.

794
01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:49.034
What's going on here?

795
01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.160
Please help me get out of here!

796
01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:52.959
It's just this place and the storm.

797
01:15:52.965 --> 01:15:54.330
That's why you're upset.

798
01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:55.172
No, no!

799
01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:56.007
They're all dead.

800
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:57.250
They're all dead!

801
01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:58.092
All right, all right.

802
01:15:58.095 --> 01:15:58.926
I'll go look.

803
01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:00.715
No, no, please don't leave me.

804
01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:01.758
They'll kill you too!

805
01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:04.340
I'm not afraid.

806
01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:25.194
Oh, my Lord!

807
01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.330
So young.

808
01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:30.283
So pretty.

809
01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:34.287
Oh, what monster could have done this?

810
01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:37.130
Bill's out there!

811
01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:40.798
Oh, God, this place!

812
01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:45.139
Steve should never have
opened this place again!

813
01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.974
There's been too much trouble here.

814
01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:51.312
Did you know that a young boy drowned

815
01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:53.727
the year before those
two others were killed?

816
01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:56.522
The counselors weren't
paying any attention.

817
01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:59.487
They were making love while
that young boy drowned.

818
01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.532
His name was Jason.

819
01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:08.283
I was working the day that it happened.

820
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.621
Preparing meals.

821
01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:10.456
Here.

822
01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:11.949
I was the cook.

823
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.295
Jason should have been watched,
every minute!

824
01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.037
He was...

825
01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.884
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

826
01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:26.760
We can go now, dear.

827
01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:30.226
I think we should wait for Mr. Christy.

828
01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.680
That's not necessary.

829
01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:34.476
I don't understand.

830
01:17:36.861 --> 01:17:38.772
Help me!

831
01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:39.985
Help!

832
01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.571
Help, Mommy!

833
01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:42.735
Help!

834
01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:43.697
Help, Mommy!

835
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.900
Mommy, help!

836
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:47.026
I am, Jason.

837
01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:49.579
I am.

838
01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:50.538
Help!

839
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:51.372
Help me!

840
01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.243
You see, Jason was my son.

841
01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:57.040
And today is his birthday.

842
01:17:57.965 --> 01:17:59.581
Where's Mr. Christy?

843
01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:03.835
Oh, I couldn't let them
open this place again.

844
01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:04.631
Could I?

845
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:07.551
Not after what happened.

846
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.311
Oh, my sweet, innocent Jason.

847
01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.020
My only child.

848
01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:20.727
Jason.

849
01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.321
You let him drown.

850
01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:29.820
You never paid any attention!

851
01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:34.081
Look what you did to him.

852
01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.246
Look what you did to him!

853
01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:41.808
Kill her, Mommy.

854
01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:42.604
Kill her!

855
01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.365
Don't let her get away, Mommy.

856
01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:51.029
Don't let her live!

857
01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:53.403
I won't, Jason.

858
01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:54.996
I won't!

859
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.748
Where are the goddamn bullets?

860
01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:03.685
Come, dear.

861
01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:07.735
It'll be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

862
01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.070
Kill her, Mommy.

863
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:15.655
Kill her.

864
01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:19.405
Kill her.

865
01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:29.586
Come on.

866
01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:57.590
Kill her, mommy.

867
01:22:57.598 --> 01:22:58.383
Kill her.

868
01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.007
She can't hide.

869
01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:02.383
No place to hide.

870
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.806
Get her, Mommy.

871
01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.224
Get her!

872
01:23:06.231 --> 01:23:07.392
Kill her.

873
01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:08.560
Kill her.

874
01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:09.602
Kill her.

875
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.941
Kill her.

876
01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:11.979
Kill her.

877
01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:12.852
Kill her.

878
01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:13.728
Kill her!

879
01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:41.470
No, no!

880
01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:43.560
It's all right, dear.

881
01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:44.348
You're okay.

882
01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:45.187
10 milligrams Valium.

883
01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:46.271
It's all right now, Alice.

884
01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:47.184
It's all over.

885
01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:48.023
Everything's over.

886
01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:53.028
Roll over.

887
01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:54.317
Roll over, dear.

888
01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:02.905
Dr. Ross wanted in surgery.

889
01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:05.828
Dr. Ross wanted in surgery.

890
01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:06.620
Okay.

891
01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:16.505
Your folks are on the way up.

892
01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:21.094
Is anyone else alive?

893
01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:24.927
Are they all dead?

894
01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:26.770
Yes, ma'am.

895
01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.106
Two of my men pulled you out of the lake.

896
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:32.272
We thought you were dead too.

897
01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:35.687
Do you remember very much?

898
01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:38.648
The boy.

899
01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:39.695
Is he dead too?

900
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:42.201
Who?

901
01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:43.491
The boy, Jason.

902
01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:47.206
Jason?

903
01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:48.416
In the lake.

904
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.455
The one who attacked me,

905
01:31:49.462 --> 01:31:51.578
the one who pulled me
underneath the water.

906
01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:56.542
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

907
01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:00.462
But he...

908
01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:09.225
Then he's still there.
