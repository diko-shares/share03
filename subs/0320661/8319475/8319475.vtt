02:50:16.114 --> 02:50:19.413
That kingdom can never
be surrendered.

1410
02:50:25.890 --> 02:50:28.051
What should I do?

1411
02:50:30.695 --> 02:50:34.756
I'm still the queen of Acre,
Ashkelon, Tripoli.

1412
02:50:35.867 --> 02:50:38.563
Decide not to be a queen...

1413
02:50:38.670 --> 02:50:41.138
and I will come to you.

1414
02:51:10.435 --> 02:51:12.733
The perfect knight.

1415
02:51:12.837 --> 02:51:14.964
Is that what you
think you are, is it?

1416
02:51:29.954 --> 02:51:31.979
We are all of us what we do.

1417
02:52:42.193 --> 02:52:44.161
Do it.

1418
02:52:49.067 --> 02:52:51.365
When you rise again...

1419
02:52:51.469 --> 02:52:53.494
if you rise...

1420
02:52:55.106 --> 02:52:57.939
rise a knight.

1422

1423
02:54:18.689 --> 02:54:20.953
I will not keep it.

1424
02:54:22.393 --> 02:54:25.191
Thank you.

1425
02:54:26.798 --> 02:54:29.028
And if God does not love you...

1426
02:54:29.133 --> 02:54:33.092
how could you have done all the things
that you have done?

1427
02:54:34.572 --> 02:54:36.802
Peace be upon you.
