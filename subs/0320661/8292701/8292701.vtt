It was shouted in the streets
that you killed a great lord of Syria

379
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.649
Saladin himself sent word

380
00:43:13.753 --> 00:43:16.347
that your fight
did not breach the peace

381

That he is king of the Saracens

384

and that he surrounds this kingdom

385
00:43:26.733 --> 00:43:30.134
He has 200,000 men in Damascus alone

386
00:43:30.236 --> 00:43:33.137
He could win a war if he goes to war

387
00:43:33.239 --> 00:43:38.233
and he's daily given cause for war
by fanatics newly from Europe

388

like Reynald de Chatillon

And it was he, not my father's physicians,
who noticed that I felt no pain
