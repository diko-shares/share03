Dinghy off the port bow.

- Captain, dinghy off the...

00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:21.315
I got it!

I got it.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.820
Where is it?

10
00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:33.841
It's right here, captain.

11
00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:41.549
I never thought I'd see it
with me own eye.

32
00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:09.961
We've got a situation in there

33
00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:12.564
I'd rather not discuss
till me manager gets here.

34
00:03:12.578 --> 00:03:14.614
Look, there he is.

35
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.928
Talk to me, Krabs.

36
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:24.677
It started out as a simple order:
a Krabby Patty with cheese.

37
00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:26.999
When the customer took a bite,

38
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.729
no cheese!

39
00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.347
Get ahold of yourself, Eugene.
I'm going in.

40
00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:38.889
Take it easy, friend. I'm the manager
of this establishment.

41
00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.341
Everything's gonna be just fine.

42
00:03:42.437 --> 00:03:45.827
- I'm really scared here, man.
- You got a name?

43
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.703
- Phil.
- You got a family, Phil?

44
00:03:51.236 --> 00:03:54.050
Come on, Phil, stay with me.
Let's hear about that family.

45
00:03:54.072 --> 00:03:56.966
I got a wife
and two beautiful children.

46
00:03:56.991 --> 00:04:00.442
That's what it's all about.
I want you to do me a favour, Phil.

47
00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:01.927
What?

48
00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:03.876
Say cheese.

49
00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:18.987
Order up.

50
00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:24.485
Three cheers for the manager!

51
00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:26.160

Hooray!

55
00:04:38.527 --> 00:04:40.563
Gary, I had that dream again.

56
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.374
And it's finally gonna
come true. Today.

57
00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.496
Sorry about this, calendar.

58
00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:50.743
Because today is the grand-opening
ceremony for The Krusty Krab 2,

59
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:54.591
where Mr. Krabs will announce
the new manager.

60
00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.711
Who's it gonna be, Gary?

61
00:04:58.044 --> 00:05:01.593
Well, let's ask my wall
of 374 consecutive

62
00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:03.761
employee-of-the-month awards.

63
00:05:04.216 --> 00:05:06.571
SpongeBob SquarePants.

64
00:05:07.052 --> 00:05:09.168
I'm ready. Promotion.

65
00:05:48.338 --> 00:05:50.533
Cleanliness is next to
manager-liness.

66
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.230
I'm ready. Promotion.

67
00:05:54.593 --> 00:05:56.311
I'm ready. Promotion.

68
00:06:14.986 --> 00:06:17.375
SpongeBob!
What are you doing in here?

69
00:06:17.696 --> 00:06:19.334
I have to tell you something,
Squidward.

70
00:06:19.615 --> 00:06:22.573
Whatever it is,
can't it wait until we get to work?

71
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.787
- There's no shower at work.
- What do you want?

72
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.792
I just wanted to say
I'll be thanking you

73
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.071
in my managerial acceptance
speech today.

74
00:06:30.374 --> 00:06:32.842
Get out!

75
00:06:33.168 --> 00:06:35.887
Okay. I'll see you at the ceremony.

76
00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:39.568
That sounds like the manager
of the new Krusty Krab 2.

77
00:06:39.924 --> 00:06:41.801
Oops. Hold on.

78
00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:45.209
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Oh, thanks, Patrick.

79
00:06:45.554 --> 00:06:49.263
And tonight, after my big promotion,
we're gonna party till we're purple.

80
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:51.120
I love being purple!

81
00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:54.225
We're going to the place
where all the action is.

82
00:06:54.562 --> 00:06:56.837
- You don't mean...?
- Oh, I mean.

83
00:06:57.147 --> 00:07:01.220
Goofy Goober's Ice Cream
Party Boat!

84
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.325
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

85
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:13.654
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

86
00:07:14.954 --> 00:07:16.592
I'd better get going.

87
00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:19.945
I'm ready. Promotion.
I'm ready. Promotion.

88
00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:22.965
Good luck, SpongeBob.
Hey, look for me at the ceremony.

89
00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:25.490
I got a little surprise for you.

90
00:07:25.797 --> 00:07:28.072
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober
Yeah</i>

91
00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:29.671
Hello, Bikini Bottom!

92
00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:33.778
Perch Perkins here, coming
to you live from in front of

93
00:07:34.096 --> 00:07:35.211
The Krusty Krab restaurant,

94
00:07:35.472 --> 00:07:37.781
for years the only place
to get a delicious

95
00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:41.887
and mouth-watering Krabby Patty.
Until today, that is.

96
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.707
That's right, folks. Long-time owner
Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant

97
00:07:47.107 --> 00:07:50.099
called The Krusty Krab 2.

98
00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:54.079
First of all,
congratulations, Mr. Krabs.

99
00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:56.316
Hello. I like money.

100
00:07:56.615 --> 00:07:59.254
What inspired you to build
a second Krusty Krab

101
00:07:59.576 --> 00:08:01.487
right next door to the original?

102
00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:03.185
Money.

103
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:05.479
Curses!

104
00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:08.888
It's not fair.

105
00:08:09.168 --> 00:08:11.636
Krabs is being interviewed
by Perch Perkins,

106
00:08:11.962 --> 00:08:14.601
and I've never even had
one customer!

107
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:25.441
<i>Don't get worked up again, Plankton,
I just mopped the floors.</i>

108
00:08:25.807 --> 00:08:30.039
Oh, Karen, my computer wife,
if only I could have managed to steal

109
00:08:30.436 --> 00:08:32.108
the secret to Krabs' success,

110
00:08:32.396 --> 00:08:35.593
the formula for the Krabby Patty.

111
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.824
Then people would line up
to eat at my restaurant.

112
00:08:41.154 --> 00:08:43.668
Lord knows I've tried.

113
00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:49.094
I've exhausted every evil plan
in my filing cabinet...

114
00:08:49.494 --> 00:08:52.327
<i>- ...from A to Y.
- A to Y?</i>

115
00:08:52.664 --> 00:08:54.495
Yeah, A to Y.
You know, the alphabet.

116
00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:56.190
<i>What about Z?</i>

117
00:08:56.459 --> 00:09:00.213
<i>- Z?
- Z. The letter after Y.</i>

118
00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:02.722
W, X, Y,

119
00:09:03.006 --> 00:09:04.200
Z. Plan Z!

120
00:09:04.466 --> 00:09:07.742
<i>- Here it is, just like you said.
- Oh, boy.</i>

121
00:09:12.014 --> 00:09:13.572
It's evil.

122
00:09:13.849 --> 00:09:16.522
It's diabolical.

123
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:18.569
It's lemon-scented.

124
00:09:18.853 --> 00:09:22.323
This Plan Z can't possibly fail!

125
00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:26.095
So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs,

126
00:09:26.443 --> 00:09:29.196
because by tomorrow,
I'll have the formula.

127
00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:31.247
Then everyone will eat
at the Chum Bucket,

128
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:34.045
and I will rule the world!

129
00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:37.757
All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...!

130
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.829
I'm ready. Promotion.
I'm ready. Promotion.

131
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.118
I think I stepped in something.

132
00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:51.579
Not in something,
on someone, you twit.

133
00:09:51.965 --> 00:09:53.114
Sorry, Plankton.

134
00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:56.079
Are you on your way
to the grand-opening ceremony?

135
00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:59.696
No, I am not on my way over
to the grand-opening ceremony.

136
00:10:00.056 --> 00:10:04.891
I'm busy planning to rule the world!

137
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:07.676
Well, good luck with that.

138
00:10:07.937 --> 00:10:11.816
I'm ready. Promotion.
I'm ready. Promotion.

139
00:10:12.191 --> 00:10:13.749
Stupid kid.

140
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:18.300
Welcome. Welcome, everyone,
to the grand opening

141
00:10:18.655 --> 00:10:21.613
of The Krusty Krab 2.

142
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.136
- We paid $9 for this?
- I paid 10.

143
00:10:26.495 --> 00:10:28.372
Now, before we begin
with the ribbon-cutting,

144
00:10:28.664 --> 00:10:32.134
I'd like to announce the name
of our new manager.

145
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.934
Yay! Yeah!

146
00:10:37.588 --> 00:10:40.785
Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah!

147
00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:44.529
Yes. Well, anyway...

148
00:10:44.803 --> 00:10:48.876
The new manager is a loyal,
hard-working employee.

149
00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:50.743
<i>Yes.</i>

150
00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:53.086
The obvious choice for the job.

151
00:10:53.393 --> 00:10:54.508
<i>He's right.</i>

152
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.001
A name you all know.
It starts with an S.

153
00:10:58.356 --> 00:11:02.110
<i>- That's me.
- Please welcome our new manager...</i>

154
00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:04.476
...Squidward Tentacles.

155
00:11:04.778 --> 00:11:08.214
Yes! Yeah!

156
00:11:09.407 --> 00:11:11.637
Oh, better luck next time, buddy.

157
00:11:15.746 --> 00:11:17.099
Yeah! All right!

158
00:11:19.374 --> 00:11:23.049
People of Bikini Bottom,
as the manager of...

159
00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:24.534
SpongeBob.

160
00:11:24.796 --> 00:11:27.947
Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an
important news flash from Mr. Krabs.

161
00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:29.891
Go ahead, Mr. K.

162
00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:33.269
I'm making a complete what
of myself?

163
00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:38.505
The most embarrassing thing
you've ever seen?

164
00:11:39.558 --> 00:11:41.196
And now it's worse
because I'm repeating

165
00:11:41.477 --> 00:11:43.115
everything you say
into the microphone?

166
00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:47.388
Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob,
you didn't get the job.

167
00:11:47.857 --> 00:11:52.726
- What?
- You did not get the job.

168
00:11:53.487 --> 00:11:55.955
But... But why?

169
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.288
SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook,

170
00:11:59.617 --> 00:12:02.768
but I gave the job to Squidward
because being manager

171
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.156
is a big responsibility.

172
00:12:05.456 --> 00:12:08.368
Well, let's face it, he's more...

173
00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:10.825
- ...mature than you.
- I'm not...

174
00:12:11.127 --> 00:12:12.355
...mature?

175
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:15.939
Lad, I mean this
in the nicest of ways,

176
00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:17.890
but there's a word for what you are,

177
00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:19.688
and that word is...

178
00:12:19.968 --> 00:12:21.640
Now, let's see...

179
00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:25.477
- Dork?
- No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.

180
00:12:25.848 --> 00:12:28.521
- A goofball?
- Closer, but no, no, no.

181
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:30.250
- A ding-a-ling.
- Wing nut.

182
00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:32.237
A Knucklehead McSpazatron.

183
00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:34.079
Okay, that's enough.

184
00:12:34.356 --> 00:12:38.235
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
you're just a kid.

185
00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:41.203
And to be a manager,
you have to be a man.

186
00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:43.838
Otherwise they'd call it ''kid-ager.''

187
00:12:44.156 --> 00:12:47.353
You understand-ager?
I mean, you understand?

188
00:12:48.243 --> 00:12:50.632
I guess so, Mr. Krabs.

189
00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.188
SpongeBob?

190
00:12:54.456 --> 00:12:57.368
I'm ready. Depression.

191
00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:00.462
I'm ready. Depression.

192
00:13:01.546 --> 00:13:02.581
Poor kid.

193
00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:06.798
Hooray for SpongeBob!

194
00:13:10.387 --> 00:13:13.618
Hooray for SpongeBob!

195
00:13:18.102 --> 00:13:20.093
Let's hear it for SpongeBob!

196
00:13:20.396 --> 00:13:21.590
Hello?

197
00:13:21.855 --> 00:13:23.925
Where'd everybody go?

198
00:13:24.232 --> 00:13:26.746
Did I miss something?

199
00:13:27.068 --> 00:13:29.423
Did you see my butt?

200
00:13:30.154 --> 00:13:31.826
<i>Later that evening...</i>

201
00:13:33.574 --> 00:13:36.407
Time to put Plan Z into effect.

202
00:13:37.744 --> 00:13:41.862
Starting at the undersea castle
of King Neptune.

203
00:13:55.593 --> 00:13:56.867
Oh, right.

204
00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:59.775
The royal court is now in session.

205
00:14:00.097 --> 00:14:02.053
Bring the prisoner forward.

206
00:14:07.603 --> 00:14:11.676
So you have confessed to the crime
of touching the king's crown.

207
00:14:12.065 --> 00:14:13.737
- Yes, but...
- But what?

208
00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:17.734
But it's my job, Your Highness.
I'm the royal crown polisher.

209
00:14:18.112 --> 00:14:22.230
Well, then I guess
I can't execute you.

210
00:14:22.616 --> 00:14:25.847
- Twenty years in the dungeon it is.
- Daddy.

211
00:14:26.495 --> 00:14:28.804
You're free to go.

212
00:14:29.122 --> 00:14:31.113
Bless you, Princess Mindy.

213
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:36.311
Mindy, how dare you defy me.

214
00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:38.027
Why do you have to be so mean?

215
00:14:38.296 --> 00:14:41.845
I am the king.
I must enforce the laws of the sea.

216
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:44.650
Father, I wish you'd try
a little love and compassion

217
00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:46.448
instead of these harsh punishments.

218
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.472
That would be nice.

219
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.641
Squire, clear the room.

220
00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.730
I wish to speak
to my daughter alone.

221
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.642
What is this, Mindy?

222
00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.896
- Your crown?
- And what does this crown do?

223
00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:03.622
- Covers your bald spot.
- It's not bald, it's

224
00:15:03.985 --> 00:15:05.213
thinning.

225
00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:10.641
This crown does much more
than cover a slightly receding hairline.

226
00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:16.229
No, this crown entitles the one who
wears it to be in charge of the sea.

227
00:15:16.663 --> 00:15:18.813
One day, you will wear this crown.

228
00:15:19.123 --> 00:15:20.158
I'm gonna be bald?

229
00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:21.815
Thinning!

230
00:15:22.084 --> 00:15:24.552
Anyway, the point is,
you won't wear it

231
00:15:24.878 --> 00:15:27.995
until you learn how to rule
with an iron fist.

232
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.171
Like your father.

233
00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:33.932
Dad, your ''crown''...

234
00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:37.374
What the...?

235
00:15:37.681 --> 00:15:39.717
My crown!

236
00:15:40.684 --> 00:15:42.914
Someone has stolen
the royal crown!

237
00:15:43.228 --> 00:15:45.696
I got it. I got it.

238
00:15:57.156 --> 00:16:00.273
Hey, all you Goobers,
it's time to say howdy

239
00:16:00.618 --> 00:16:06.136
to your favourite undersea peanut,
Goofy Goober.

240
00:16:08.458 --> 00:16:10.653
Howdy, Goofy Goober!

241
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.111
Hey, fellow Goofy Goobers.
Time to sing.

242
00:16:14.463 --> 00:16:19.457
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

243
00:16:19.884 --> 00:16:24.002
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

244
00:16:37.608 --> 00:16:40.566
All right. Get it together, old boy.

245
00:16:40.903 --> 00:16:44.691
I know. I'll just stop thinking about it.

246
00:16:45.073 --> 00:16:47.826
Hey, you know,
I actually feel a little better.

247
00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:49.911
I don't even remember
why I was sad.

248
00:16:50.202 --> 00:16:54.081
Hey, it's the new
Krusty Krab 2 manager.

249
00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:59.597
Wow, the pressure's
already setting in.

250
00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:02.069
No, Pat, you don't understand.

251
00:17:02.379 --> 00:17:03.892
I didn't get the promotion.

252
00:17:04.381 --> 00:17:05.894
What? Why?

253
00:17:06.174 --> 00:17:08.449
Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.

254
00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:11.767
- What? That's insane.
- I know.

255
00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:15.247
Well, saying you're a kid,
it's like saying I'm a kid.

256
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.387
- Here's your Goober Meal, sir.
- I'm supposed to get a toy with this.

257
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.249
Thanks.

258
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:24.718
I'm gonna head home, Pat.
The celebration's off.

259
00:17:26.108 --> 00:17:29.703
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood.

260
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.503
Okay, see you.

261
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.056
And here's your Triple
Gooberberry Sunrise, sir.

262
00:17:37.243 --> 00:17:39.199
Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, huh?

263
00:17:39.495 --> 00:17:41.213
I guess I could use one of those.

264
00:17:41.497 --> 00:17:43.135
Now you're talking.

265
00:17:43.415 --> 00:17:46.612
Hey, waiter, we need
another one over here.

266
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.110
There you go.

267
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.676
Boy, Pat, that hit the spot.

268
00:18:00.972 --> 00:18:03.406
- I'm feeling better already.
- Yeah.

269
00:18:03.724 --> 00:18:06.716
Waiter, let's get
another round over here.

270
00:18:10.647 --> 00:18:13.878
Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more, please.

271
00:18:18.112 --> 00:18:19.386
Waiter.

272
00:18:21.323 --> 00:18:23.314
Oh, waiter.

273
00:18:23.616 --> 00:18:25.368
Waiter.

274
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.855
Waiter.

275
00:18:28.162 --> 00:18:31.279
- Waiter!
- Why do I always get the nuts?

276
00:18:31.623 --> 00:18:35.582
All right, folks, this one goes out
to my two bestest friends

277
00:18:35.961 --> 00:18:37.474
in the whole world:

278
00:18:37.754 --> 00:18:40.473
Patrick and this big peanut guy.

279
00:18:40.798 --> 00:18:42.789
It's a little ditty called...

280
00:18:43.092 --> 00:18:47.131
...''Waiter!''

281
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.774
Hey. Hey, get up.

282
00:18:52.517 --> 00:18:54.075
Hey, come on, buddy.
I wanna go home.

283
00:18:54.393 --> 00:18:56.509
Come on, pal.

284
00:18:58.397 --> 00:19:00.069
Oh, my head.

285
00:19:00.357 --> 00:19:02.587
Listen to me. It's 8 in the morning.

286
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.538
Go scrape up your friend
and get going.

287
00:19:04.819 --> 00:19:06.810
My friend?

288
00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:10.343
Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy?

289
00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:13.793
Wait, you said 8:00.

290
00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:17.998
I'm late for work.
Mr. Krabs is gonna be...

291
00:19:19.373 --> 00:19:22.410
Mr. Krabs.

292
00:19:24.044 --> 00:19:25.443
Now, pay attention, Squidward.

293
00:19:25.712 --> 00:19:29.466
As new manager, you've gotta keep
a sharp eye out for paying customers.

294
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.795
Yawn.

295
00:19:32.343 --> 00:19:36.256
What's this? King Neptune is riding
toward The Krusty Krab at lunchtime.

296
00:19:36.638 --> 00:19:38.356
He's got money.

297
00:19:40.975 --> 00:19:44.285
Stay in the coach, daughter.
This won't take long.

298
00:19:44.645 --> 00:19:46.761
Daddy, please.
I think you're overreacting.

299
00:19:47.064 --> 00:19:50.500
Silence, Mindy.
I know what I'm doing.

300
00:19:50.859 --> 00:19:52.611
- Squire.
- Yes, Your Highness.

301
00:19:52.902 --> 00:19:55.257
Have this pole executed at once.

302
00:19:56.113 --> 00:19:59.423
A hundred and one dollars
for a Krabby Patty?

303
00:19:59.783 --> 00:20:03.014
With cheese, Mr. Squidward,
with cheese.

304
00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.541
Greeting, subjects.

305
00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:11.427
I seek the one known
as Eugene Krabs.

306
00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:14.710
May he present himself
to me at once.

307
00:20:15.046 --> 00:20:18.959
I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness.
Would you like to order something?

308
00:20:19.342 --> 00:20:22.379
Nay! I'm on to you, Krabs!

309
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.632
You have stolen the royal crown,
you cannot deny.

310
00:20:25.972 --> 00:20:27.451
For, clever as you are,

311
00:20:27.724 --> 00:20:31.717
you left one damning piece of evidence
at the scene of the crime.

312
00:20:32.103 --> 00:20:34.742
''I stole your crown.
Signed, Eugene Krabs.''

313
00:20:35.064 --> 00:20:37.453
Relinquish the royal crown
to me at once.

314
00:20:37.774 --> 00:20:40.652
But... But this is crazy. I didn't do it.

315
00:20:40.985 --> 00:20:44.580
<i>Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs.
Leave a message.</i>

316
00:20:44.947 --> 00:20:48.986
<i>Hi, Mr. Krabs. This is Clay,
the guy you sold Neptune's crown to.</i>

317
00:20:49.368 --> 00:20:52.326
<i>Yeah, I just wanted to say
thanks again for selling me the crown.</i>

318
00:20:52.662 --> 00:20:55.938
<i>Neptune's crown.
I sold it to a guy in Shell City,</i>

319
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.963
<i>and I just wanted to say thanks again
for selling me the crown.</i>

320
00:20:59.293 --> 00:21:01.170
<i>Neptune's crown.</i>

321
00:21:02.421 --> 00:21:04.981
<i>Which is now in Shell City.
Goodbye.</i>

322
00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:10.189
Don't you just hate wrong numbers?

323
00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:13.142
My crown is in
the forbidden Shell City?!

324
00:21:16.433 --> 00:21:19.470
Plan Z. I love Plan Z.

325
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.494
Prepare to burn, Krabs.

326
00:21:25.816 --> 00:21:29.172
Wait, Neptune.
Please, I'm begging you.

327
00:21:29.527 --> 00:21:33.122
I ain't a crook.
Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me.

328
00:21:34.073 --> 00:21:35.711
Very well, then.

329
00:21:36.492 --> 00:21:39.484
Before I turn this conniving
crustacean into fishmeal,

330
00:21:39.828 --> 00:21:44.697
who here has anything to say
about Eugene Krabs?

331
00:21:45.583 --> 00:21:51.374
I've got something to say
about Mr. Krabs.

332
00:21:51.838 --> 00:21:54.432
SpongeBob, me boy,
you've come just in time.

333
00:21:54.758 --> 00:21:57.113
- Pardon me, miss.
- Please, tell King Neptune

334
00:21:57.427 --> 00:21:59.065
all about me.

335
00:21:59.345 --> 00:22:03.497
I have worked for Mr. Krabs
for many years

336
00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:07.725
and always thought
he was a great boss.

337
00:22:08.103 --> 00:22:09.422
You see? A great boss.

338
00:22:09.687 --> 00:22:14.124
I now realize
that he's a great big jerk!

339
00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:17.535
I deserve that manager's job!

340
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:22.696
But you didn't give it to me,
because you say I'm a kid.

341
00:22:23.116 --> 00:22:26.995
Well, I am 100-percent man!

342
00:22:27.369 --> 00:22:33.046
And this man has got
something to say to you.

343
00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:44.563
There. I think I made my point.

344
00:22:45.885 --> 00:22:47.034
Anyone else?

345
00:22:47.303 --> 00:22:49.419
No? Well, then.

346
00:22:54.601 --> 00:22:56.592
Me pants are on fire!

347
00:22:56.895 --> 00:22:59.170
Me underwear's on fire!

348
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.675
I'm on fire!

349
00:23:03.901 --> 00:23:05.414
Oh, yeah.

350
00:23:05.694 --> 00:23:09.448
And now, Eugene Krabs, you will...

351
00:23:09.823 --> 00:23:11.017
Wait.

352
00:23:11.991 --> 00:23:13.982
I'm flattered you would do this
on my account,

353
00:23:14.285 --> 00:23:16.924
but being manager
isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.

354
00:23:17.246 --> 00:23:21.637
Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown,
and now it's in Shell City.

355
00:23:22.042 --> 00:23:24.795
- That's why he must die.
- Doesn't it seem a little harsh

356
00:23:25.128 --> 00:23:26.481
to kill someone over a crown?

357
00:23:26.754 --> 00:23:30.542
You don't understand. My crown
is a symbol of my king-like authority.

358
00:23:30.924 --> 00:23:33.392
And between you and me...

359
00:23:33.718 --> 00:23:35.037
...my hair is thinning a bit.

360
00:23:35.303 --> 00:23:39.455
Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not
that notice... Bald. Bald.

361
00:23:39.849 --> 00:23:42.602
- Bald! Bald!
- Bald! Bald!

362
00:23:43.435 --> 00:23:44.629
My eyes!

363
00:23:44.895 --> 00:23:46.408
All right, all right.

364
00:23:46.688 --> 00:23:48.406
King Neptune, sir?

365
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.921
Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life
if I went to get your crown back?

366
00:23:52.276 --> 00:23:55.427
You, go to Shell City?

367
00:24:01.117 --> 00:24:04.314
No one who's gone to Shell City
has ever returned.

368
00:24:04.662 --> 00:24:08.894
What makes you think you could?
You're just a kid.

369
00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:12.070
But I'm not a kid. I can do it.

370
00:24:12.377 --> 00:24:14.937
Run along, I have a crab to cook.

371
00:24:16.464 --> 00:24:18.420
No! I won't let you.

372
00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:20.493
Very well, then.

373
00:24:20.759 --> 00:24:23.637
I'll have to fry you both.

374
00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.198
Daddy, stop it.

375
00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:28.475
Can't you get through one day
without executing someone?

376
00:24:28.808 --> 00:24:31.481
Mindy. I told you
to stay in the carriage.

377
00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.368
Where's your love and compassion?

378
00:24:33.854 --> 00:24:35.333
Look at this little guy.

379
00:24:35.605 --> 00:24:38.881
He's willing to risk his life
to find your crown and save his boss.

380
00:24:39.233 --> 00:24:41.349
- But, daughter, I...
- Please, Father?

381
00:24:41.652 --> 00:24:44.485
At least let him try.
What have you got to lose?

382
00:24:44.822 --> 00:24:47.814
Might I remind you
of your special problem?

383
00:24:48.158 --> 00:24:52.197
- Bald! Bald! Bald!
- Bald!

384
00:24:52.578 --> 00:24:54.091
- Bald! Bald!
- My eyes!

385
00:24:54.371 --> 00:24:55.770
All right.

386
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.393
Very well, Mindy.

387
00:24:57.666 --> 00:24:59.099
I'll give him a chance.

388
00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:02.493
But when your little champion
fails to return,

389
00:25:02.837 --> 00:25:06.068
I get to splatter this crab
all over the walls.

390
00:25:06.424 --> 00:25:10.736
And as for you, be back here
with my crown in exactly ten days.

391
00:25:11.136 --> 00:25:12.569
- He can do it in nine.
- Eight.

392
00:25:12.846 --> 00:25:13.995
- Seven.
- Six.

393
00:25:14.264 --> 00:25:16.220
- Patrick!
- Patrick!

394
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:17.744
Six it is, then.

395
00:25:18.017 --> 00:25:20.053
- Five.
- Patrick, shush.

396
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:24.470
Until then, the crab shall remain
frozen where he now stands.

397
00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:26.733
No, wait. I'm begging you.

398
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.272
Who turned on the AC? Mr. Krabs!

399
00:25:33.447 --> 00:25:35.403
Oh, no, this is terrible.

400
00:25:35.699 --> 00:25:37.257
Who's gonna sign my paycheck?

401
00:25:37.534 --> 00:25:38.933
Come along, Mindy.

402
00:25:39.702 --> 00:25:42.819
Listen, you guys, the road
to Shell City is really dangerous.

403
00:25:43.164 --> 00:25:45.724
There's crooks, killers
and monsters everywhere.

404
00:25:46.041 --> 00:25:47.759
And what's worse,
there's a giant Cyclops

405
00:25:48.043 --> 00:25:51.194
who guards the outskirts of the city
and preys on innocent sea creatures.

406
00:25:51.546 --> 00:25:53.616
Don't let him catch you,
because if he does,

407
00:25:53.923 --> 00:25:56.596
he'll take you back to his lair,
and you'll never be seen again.

408
00:25:56.926 --> 00:25:59.235
She's purty, SpongeBob.

409
00:25:59.553 --> 00:26:00.781
Here, take this.

410
00:26:01.054 --> 00:26:02.453
What's in here?

411
00:26:03.431 --> 00:26:04.944
It's a magical bag of winds.

412
00:26:05.224 --> 00:26:07.738
- I stole them from my father.
- You're hot.

413
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.937
Once you find the crown,
open the bag of winds

414
00:26:10.229 --> 00:26:11.503
and you'll be blown back home.

415
00:26:11.772 --> 00:26:13.524
- Mindy!
- I'm coming.

416
00:26:13.815 --> 00:26:16.887
- Good luck, SpongeBob.
- Wait. How did you know my name?

417
00:26:17.235 --> 00:26:18.953
Oh, I'm gonna be
queen of the sea one day.

418
00:26:19.237 --> 00:26:21.228
I've learned the names
of all the sea creatures.

419
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.963
What's my name?

420
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.276
That's easy. You're Patrick Star.

421
00:26:30.413 --> 00:26:33.211
- Mindy!
- I gotta go. I believe in you guys.

422
00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:34.656
Thanks, Mindy.

423
00:26:35.125 --> 00:26:38.083
Don't worry, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick, Squidward and I...

424
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.819
Pass.

425
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.739
- Patrick and I...
- Hi.

426
00:26:44.008 --> 00:26:47.523
...are gonna get that crown back
and save you from Neptune's wrath.

427
00:26:47.886 --> 00:26:52.038
You've got nothing to worry about.
Your life is in our hands.

428
00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.148
Patrick, let's go get that crown.

429
00:27:15.744 --> 00:27:18.702
- Feast your eyes, Patrick.
- What is it?

430
00:27:20.123 --> 00:27:21.920
The Patty Wagon.

431
00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:24.646
Mr. Krabs uses it
for promotional reasons.

432
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.598
Let me show you
some of its features.

433
00:27:26.879 --> 00:27:29.473
Sesame-seed finish,
steel-belted pickles,

434
00:27:29.798 --> 00:27:32.153
grilled-leather interior.
And under the hood,

435
00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:36.585
a fuel-injected french-fryer
with dual overhead grease traps.

436
00:27:36.971 --> 00:27:40.043
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

437
00:27:41.558 --> 00:27:44.311
Hey, I thought you didn't have
a driver's license.

438
00:27:44.644 --> 00:27:47.397
You don't need a license
to drive a sandwich.

439
00:27:57.947 --> 00:28:02.259
- Shell City, here we come!
- Shell City, here we come!

440
00:28:05.912 --> 00:28:07.311
Ding-a-ling.

441
00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.299
Hey there, old buddy. Freeze.

442
00:28:12.668 --> 00:28:15.341
One secret formula to go, please.

443
00:28:15.671 --> 00:28:18.902
No, no, don't trouble yourself.
I'll get it.

444
00:28:21.342 --> 00:28:25.381
Well, I'd like to hang around,
but I've got Krabby Patties to make...

445
00:28:26.013 --> 00:28:28.208
...over at the Chum Bucket.

446
00:28:28.515 --> 00:28:32.633
Plan Z, I love you.

447
00:28:38.524 --> 00:28:43.279
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

448
00:28:43.695 --> 00:28:46.448
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

449
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.673
Fill her up, please.

450
00:28:53.328 --> 00:28:57.526
What'll it be, fellas,
mustard or ketchup?

451
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.109
Are they laughing at us?

452
00:29:02.378 --> 00:29:04.892
No, Patrick,
they're laughing next to us.

453
00:29:06.715 --> 00:29:08.592
Where you two dumb kids
headed, anyway?

454
00:29:08.883 --> 00:29:10.635
- Kids?
- Now, Patrick.

455
00:29:10.927 --> 00:29:14.203
For your information,
we are not kids, we are men.

456
00:29:14.555 --> 00:29:18.104
And we're off to get
King Neptune's crown in Shell City.

457
00:29:18.475 --> 00:29:19.908
- Shell City?
- Shell City?

458
00:29:20.185 --> 00:29:24.656
Ain't that the place that's guarded
by a killer Cyclops?

459
00:29:25.106 --> 00:29:26.221
That's right.

460
00:29:26.482 --> 00:29:29.280
Lloyd, take off your hat in respect.

461
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.248
Respect for the dead!

462
00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:42.368
You two dipsticks ain't gonna last
ten seconds over the county line.

463
00:29:42.746 --> 00:29:45.783
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

464
00:29:48.543 --> 00:29:50.659
Out of the car, fellas.

465
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.836
How many seconds was that?

466
00:29:59.135 --> 00:30:01.126
Twelve.

467
00:30:01.429 --> 00:30:03.385
- In your face.
- In your face.

468
00:30:08.268 --> 00:30:11.180
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

469
00:30:11.521 --> 00:30:13.876
Who's the kid now?

470
00:30:15.691 --> 00:30:16.760
They're dead.

471
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.975
Perch Perkins here
with an incredible news flash.

472
00:30:24.282 --> 00:30:26.671
Plankton is selling Krabby Patties
at the Chum Bucket.

473
00:30:26.993 --> 00:30:29.143
How is this possible? Let's find out.

474
00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:32.286
Step right up. Plenty for everybody.

475
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:35.012
<i>Excuse me, Plankton.
Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News.</i>

476
00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:38.564
- Can I get a minute?
- Anything for you, Perch.

477
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.435
All of Bikini Bottom wants to know,
how did you get the Krabby Patty?

478
00:30:42.798 --> 00:30:46.507
Well, Perch, before my dear friend
Eugene Krabs

479
00:30:46.885 --> 00:30:49.922
was frozen by King Neptune...

480
00:30:50.263 --> 00:30:51.855
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:52.849 --> 00:30:55.079
He confided in me a secret wish.

482
00:30:55.392 --> 00:30:59.670
''Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence
at the Chum Bucket,'' he said.

483
00:31:00.063 --> 00:31:02.531
''Don't let the flame die out.''

484
00:31:06.485 --> 00:31:09.158
By the way, act now and you get
a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet

485
00:31:09.488 --> 00:31:11.285
with every purchase.
Here you go, Perch.

486
00:31:11.573 --> 00:31:14.963
- Thanks.
- Bucket helmets for everyone!

487
00:31:17.828 --> 00:31:19.307
My helmet!

488
00:31:22.666 --> 00:31:24.941
Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy

489
00:31:25.252 --> 00:31:27.686
since the day you agreed
to be my wife.

490
00:31:28.004 --> 00:31:29.232
<i>I never agreed.</i>

491
00:31:29.505 --> 00:31:32.178
Evil Plan Z is working perfectly.

492
00:31:32.508 --> 00:31:34.385
Nothing can stop me now.

493
00:31:34.676 --> 00:31:37.110
<i>Nothing except SpongeBob
and his pink friend.</i>

494
00:31:37.804 --> 00:31:41.638
<i>My sensors indicate
that they're going after the crown.</i>

495
00:31:42.016 --> 00:31:45.486
<i>lf they make it back, Neptune might
discover some fingerprints.</i>

496
00:31:45.853 --> 00:31:47.730
<i>Tiny fingerprints.</i>

497
00:31:48.855 --> 00:31:51.415
<i>Stubby, tiny fingerprints.</i>

498
00:31:51.733 --> 00:31:54.531
Evil Plan Z
is way ahead of you, baby.

499
00:31:54.861 --> 00:31:57.933
I've already hired someone
to take care of those two.

500
00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.431
He's a vicious,
cold-blooded predator.

501
00:32:18.506 --> 00:32:19.780
Sesame seed.

502
00:32:20.049 --> 00:32:21.607
Hey, mister.

503
00:32:21.884 --> 00:32:24.603
Does that hat take ten gallons?

504
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:47.224
- Going on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:49.601
- Moving on.
- Just keep going.

506
00:32:49.908 --> 00:32:51.057
Yup.

507
00:32:51.326 --> 00:32:53.044
Gonna get that crown.

508
00:32:56.247 --> 00:32:57.566
Oh, yeah.

509
00:32:57.832 --> 00:32:59.151
- All right.
- All right.

510
00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:02.055
Yeah. Victory.

511
00:33:02.377 --> 00:33:06.165
- Are we there yet?
- We must be close by now.

512
00:33:07.298 --> 00:33:08.651
Patrick, look. We're doing great!

513
00:33:10.593 --> 00:33:12.902
Shell City's only five days away.

514
00:33:14.471 --> 00:33:15.665
By car.

515
00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:19.430
I wish we still had our car.

516
00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:21.125
SpongeBob, look.

517
00:33:21.394 --> 00:33:22.827
Our car!

518
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.079
- The key.
- Where do you think it is?

519
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:51.287
There it is, Pat. The key!

520
00:33:51.962 --> 00:33:53.236
Now, how are we gonna get it?

521
00:33:53.505 --> 00:33:55.700
I know. Walk in and ask him for it.

522
00:33:56.007 --> 00:33:58.316
What are you looking at?

523
00:33:59.468 --> 00:34:02.778
- Patrick, that's a terrible idea.
- Sorry.

524
00:34:03.138 --> 00:34:06.608
I know. I'll go in and create
a distraction, and you get the key.

525
00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:10.392
Wait. I wanna do the distraction.

526
00:34:10.728 --> 00:34:14.926
Okay. I guess it really doesn't matter
who does the distraction.

527
00:34:15.691 --> 00:34:17.886
You see me walking back...?

528
00:34:24.198 --> 00:34:26.632
Can I have everybody's attention?

529
00:34:33.498 --> 00:34:35.056
I have to use the bathroom.

530
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.209
It's right over there.

531
00:34:40.796 --> 00:34:44.948
Stupid contacts. Oh, there it is.
I better go wash it off.

532
00:34:46.467 --> 00:34:49.027
Patrick. You call that a distraction?

533
00:34:49.345 --> 00:34:50.824
Well, I had to go to the bathroom.

534
00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.489
Well, I got my hands dirty
for nothing.

535
00:34:54.975 --> 00:34:57.045
Patrick, check it out.

536
00:34:59.187 --> 00:35:00.381
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

537
00:35:00.646 --> 00:35:02.398
- Bubble party!
- Bubble party!

538
00:35:19.413 --> 00:35:20.528
Hey!

539
00:35:20.789 --> 00:35:23.144
Who blew this bubble?

540
00:35:25.835 --> 00:35:27.587
You all know the rules!

541
00:35:27.878 --> 00:35:30.995
All bubble-blowing babies
will be beaten senseless

542
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.935
by every able-bodied patron
in the bar.

543
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:38.293
That's right! So who blew it?

544
00:35:39.889 --> 00:35:42.926
So nobody knows.

545
00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:45.064
- Maybe it was...
- Shut up!

546
00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:48.472
Somebody in here ain't a real man.

547
00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:51.088
You! We're on a baby hunt.

548
00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:55.039
And don't think we don't know
how to weed them out.

549
00:35:55.527 --> 00:35:58.041
Now, everybody line up.

550
00:35:58.738 --> 00:36:02.526
DJ, time for the test.

551
00:36:06.537 --> 00:36:10.007
No baby can resist
singing along to this.

552
00:36:10.665 --> 00:36:13.782
SpongeBob, it's the
Goofy Goober theme song.

553
00:36:14.127 --> 00:36:15.640
I know.

554
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.115
<i>Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

555
00:36:18.672 --> 00:36:20.867
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

556
00:36:21.174 --> 00:36:25.406
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

557
00:36:25.845 --> 00:36:30.555
- It was you! You're the baby!
- No, no! I only coughed, I swear.

558
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.184
DJ ! Turn it up louder!

559
00:36:37.063 --> 00:36:39.623
Don't sing along, Patrick.

560
00:36:39.941 --> 00:36:41.613
I'm trying.

561
00:36:41.942 --> 00:36:44.615
Trying so hard.

562
00:36:46.029 --> 00:36:49.908
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

563
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:54.409
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

564
00:36:54.787 --> 00:36:58.746
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

565
00:36:59.916 --> 00:37:03.113
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

566
00:37:05.087 --> 00:37:07.601
Well, well, well.

567
00:37:08.674 --> 00:37:10.585
Which one of you babies was it?

568
00:37:10.884 --> 00:37:12.317
- It was him.
- It was him.

569
00:37:12.594 --> 00:37:13.629
- He did it.
- He did it.

570
00:37:13.887 --> 00:37:15.206
I've never even eaten at...

571
00:37:15.471 --> 00:37:18.269
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

572
00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:23.229
Well, looks like we got ourselves
a double baby.

573
00:37:27.815 --> 00:37:29.533
Man, that was a close call.

574
00:37:29.817 --> 00:37:31.455
Guess what I got.

575
00:37:31.736 --> 00:37:33.613
The key!

576
00:37:43.496 --> 00:37:48.331
Too bad SpongeBob's not here
to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.

577
00:37:58.008 --> 00:37:58.997
Morning.

578
00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.149
Some people have no taste
in headgear.

579
00:38:06.432 --> 00:38:07.831
Babies too?

580
00:38:09.185 --> 00:38:10.220
Excuse me, miss,

581
00:38:10.477 --> 00:38:14.595
but where is everybody
getting that horrid headwear?

582
00:38:14.981 --> 00:38:16.050
Who said that?

583
00:38:16.316 --> 00:38:17.271
Down here.

584
00:38:17.525 --> 00:38:19.675
Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket.

585
00:38:19.986 --> 00:38:22.375
Plankton's giving them away free
with every Krabby Patty.

586
00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:25.893
Chum Bucket? Free? Krabby Patty?

587
00:38:26.241 --> 00:38:29.836
Plankton? Giving? With?

588
00:38:33.414 --> 00:38:36.770
So you're selling
Krabby Patties, Plankton?

589
00:38:37.125 --> 00:38:39.639
That's right, Squidward.

590
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:43.203
And there's a free bucket helmet
with every purchase.

591
00:38:43.548 --> 00:38:44.617
Care for one?

592
00:38:44.882 --> 00:38:48.557
No. You may have hoodwinked
everyone else in this backwater town,

593
00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:50.360
but you can't fool me.

594
00:38:50.637 --> 00:38:52.992
I listen to public radio.

595
00:38:54.015 --> 00:38:57.405
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- It means you set up Mr. Krabs.

596
00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:59.963
You stole the crown
so Neptune would freeze him

597
00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:04.310
and you could finally get your stubby
little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.

598
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:06.761
It was you all along.

599
00:39:07.068 --> 00:39:09.821
But you made one fatal mistake.

600
00:39:10.154 --> 00:39:12.224
You messed with my paycheck.

601
00:39:12.531 --> 00:39:15.921
And I'm gonna report you
to the highest authority in the land,

602
00:39:16.284 --> 00:39:17.922
King Neptune!

603
00:39:18.203 --> 00:39:21.798
We'll see about that,
Inspector Looselips.

604
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.089
<i>Now activating helmet
brain-control devices.</i>

605
00:39:33.925 --> 00:39:35.438
What?

606
00:39:44.392 --> 00:39:47.111
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

607
00:39:47.436 --> 00:39:49.347
<i>- What's going on here?
- All hail Plankton.</i>

608
00:39:49.647 --> 00:39:51.717
Seize him, slaves!

609
00:39:52.024 --> 00:39:54.219
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

610
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.509
I'm getting out of here!

611
00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:01.290
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

612
00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:03.587
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

613
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.906
Who can stop me now?

614
00:40:10.915 --> 00:40:12.951
Who?

615
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.939
- Come on, Pat, one more time.
- Okay.

616
00:40:21.257 --> 00:40:27.253
We're on a baby hunt. And don't think
we don't know how to weed them out.

617
00:40:33.935 --> 00:40:36.403
''Weed them out.''

618
00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:38.670
What a jerk.

619
00:40:44.486 --> 00:40:46.954
The road's getting kind of bumpy here.

620
00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:49.058
You know, SpongeBob,

621
00:40:49.323 --> 00:40:51.962
there's a lesson to be learned
from all of this.

622
00:40:52.284 --> 00:40:53.512
What's that, Patrick?

623
00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:57.460
A bubble-blowing double baby
doesn't belong out here

624
00:40:57.831 --> 00:40:59.503
in man's country.

625
00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:01.429
Yeah. Wait.

626
00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:03.188
We blew that bubble.

627
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:06.897
Doesn't that make us
a bubble-blowing double baby?

628
00:41:07.672 --> 00:41:09.230
Hey, look, free ice cream!

629
00:41:11.676 --> 00:41:13.394
Oh, boy!

630
00:41:19.516 --> 00:41:21.552
How you doing?

631
00:41:22.852 --> 00:41:24.171
Wait a minute.

632
00:41:24.437 --> 00:41:25.711
Wait a minute.

633
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.572
SpongeBob!

634
00:41:27.982 --> 00:41:28.937
Yeah?

635
00:41:29.858 --> 00:41:31.371
Make mine a chocolate!

636
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.578
Got you covered. Two, please.

637
00:41:33.945 --> 00:41:35.264
Certainly.

638
00:41:35.905 --> 00:41:37.463
You kids enjoy.

639
00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.049
Actually, we're men,
lady, but thanks.

640
00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:42.005
Okay, Patrick, let's...

641
00:41:42.286 --> 00:41:45.323
You can let go now.
I said, let go, please.

642
00:41:47.999 --> 00:41:49.910
What is this?

643
00:41:55.214 --> 00:41:57.409
What kind of old lady are you?

644
00:42:23.446 --> 00:42:25.596
Did you get the ice cream?

645
00:42:27.075 --> 00:42:28.793
Step on it, Patrick!

646
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:51.675
Hey!

647
00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.853
You may not know it, cowboy,

648
00:42:55.182 --> 00:42:59.858
but we got a rule around here
about blowing bubbles.

649
00:43:00.395 --> 00:43:05.264
All bubble-blowing babies
will be beaten senseless by every

650
00:43:05.691 --> 00:43:07.727
able-bodied...

651
00:43:08.736 --> 00:43:10.772
- In bar...
- Bar...

652
00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:28.394
Come on, kiddies,
have some ice cream.

653
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:34.418
I'll let you pet Mr. Whiskers.

654
00:43:37.802 --> 00:43:39.679
Jump for it, Patrick!

655
00:44:03.408 --> 00:44:06.002
Well, we lost our car again.

656
00:44:06.327 --> 00:44:09.160
Never mind the car,
where's the road?

657
00:44:09.497 --> 00:44:12.011
Road. Road. Road.

658
00:44:12.332 --> 00:44:14.527
Road. Road. Road.

659
00:44:14.835 --> 00:44:16.871
Road. R... Sorry.

660
00:44:17.545 --> 00:44:18.694
There's the road.

661
00:44:19.005 --> 00:44:20.518
On the other side of this...

662
00:44:21.674 --> 00:44:24.108
...deep, dark...

663
00:44:25.177 --> 00:44:26.849
...dangerous...

664
00:44:28.096 --> 00:44:31.327
- Hazardous.
- ...hazardous...

665
00:44:31.682 --> 00:44:33.035
Monster-infested.

666
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:35.061
Yeah, monster-infested...

667
00:44:36.603 --> 00:44:37.592
...trench.

668
00:44:37.854 --> 00:44:39.128
Hey, SpongeBob, look!

669
00:44:39.523 --> 00:44:41.514
Here's the way down.

670
00:44:45.695 --> 00:44:48.289
Well, we're not gonna get
the crown standing here.

671
00:44:48.614 --> 00:44:50.730
On to Shell City.

672
00:44:58.748 --> 00:45:00.739
Hey, look, it's making noise.

673
00:45:01.041 --> 00:45:01.996
SpongeBob?

674
00:45:04.503 --> 00:45:07.336
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going home, Patrick.

675
00:45:07.672 --> 00:45:09.310
But what about Mr. Krabs?

676
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:10.784
What about us?

677
00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.927
We'll never survive in that trench!

678
00:45:13.218 --> 00:45:15.732
You said it yourself,
this is man's country.

679
00:45:16.054 --> 00:45:19.285
And let's face it, Pat. We're just...

680
00:45:19.641 --> 00:45:21.871
- ...kids.
- We're not kids.

681
00:45:22.185 --> 00:45:23.982
Open your eyes, Patrick!

682
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.579
We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream.

683
00:45:26.897 --> 00:45:30.014
We worship a dancing peanut,
for corn's sake!

684
00:45:30.358 --> 00:45:32.269
We don't belong out here!

685
00:45:32.568 --> 00:45:35.287
We do not worship him.

686
00:45:35.613 --> 00:45:38.571
You've been wearing the same Goofy
Goober Peanut Party underpants

687
00:45:38.907 --> 00:45:39.942
for three years straight.

688
00:45:40.325 --> 00:45:41.963
What do you call that?

689
00:45:42.244 --> 00:45:43.518
Worship?

690
00:45:43.787 --> 00:45:47.143
You're right, SpongeBob.
We are kids.

691
00:45:54.629 --> 00:45:56.142
Pull your pants up, Patrick.

692
00:45:56.422 --> 00:45:59.061
- We're going home.
- But you can't go home.

693
00:46:00.134 --> 00:46:01.089
Mindy!

694
00:46:01.343 --> 00:46:02.822
Mindy?

695
00:46:04.972 --> 00:46:07.281
- How much did you hear?
- I heard enough.

696
00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:10.033
- Did you see my underwear?
- No, Patrick.

697
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:11.386
Did you want to?

698
00:46:11.644 --> 00:46:12.838
Look, guys, you may be kids,

699
00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:15.459
but you're the only ones left
who can get that crown.

700
00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:17.445
What do you mean,
the only ones left?

701
00:46:17.733 --> 00:46:20.930
Things have gotten a lot worse
since you left Bikini Bottom.

702
00:46:21.277 --> 00:46:25.031
Or should I say Planktopolis.

703
00:46:25.406 --> 00:46:27.476
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

704
00:46:27.908 --> 00:46:29.102
No resting!

705
00:46:29.368 --> 00:46:33.361
This monument celebrating my glory
isn't gonna build itself.

706
00:46:33.746 --> 00:46:35.338
Move faster!

707
00:46:35.623 --> 00:46:37.773
Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look!

708
00:46:38.084 --> 00:46:40.882
Plankton's turned everyone
we know into slaves.

709
00:46:41.295 --> 00:46:42.614
Squidward.

710
00:46:43.296 --> 00:46:44.615
Sandy.

711
00:46:44.881 --> 00:46:46.109
Mrs. Puff.

712
00:46:47.467 --> 00:46:48.536
Even Gary.

713
00:46:49.635 --> 00:46:50.784
Plankton.

714
00:46:51.178 --> 00:46:53.089
Can't your father do something?

715
00:46:53.555 --> 00:46:55.989
My father's too distracted
by his bald spot to do anything.

716
00:46:58.643 --> 00:47:01.111
Squire, will you hurry.

717
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.460
So you see, you can't quit.

718
00:47:05.774 --> 00:47:08.129
The fate of Bikini Bottom
rests in your hands.

719
00:47:08.652 --> 00:47:11.883
- But... But we're just...
- Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids.

720
00:47:12.238 --> 00:47:15.116
And what's so wrong with
being a kid, anyway? Kids rule!

721
00:47:15.449 --> 00:47:17.519
You don't need to be a man
to do this.

722
00:47:17.826 --> 00:47:20.021
You just gotta believe in yourself.

723
00:47:20.328 --> 00:47:22.888
You just gotta believe!

724
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:26.645
- I believe.
- That's the spirit.

725
00:47:26.959 --> 00:47:28.472
I believe that

726
00:47:28.752 --> 00:47:32.791
everybody I know is a goner!

727
00:47:34.257 --> 00:47:35.326
Come on, guys.

728
00:47:37.927 --> 00:47:39.883
Guys.

729
00:47:41.222 --> 00:47:43.099
Guys?

730
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:03.276
Guys?

731
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.997
Oh, boy.

732
00:48:09.702 --> 00:48:11.533
Think, Mindy, think.

733
00:48:13.539 --> 00:48:15.370
Yup, I guess you're right.

734
00:48:17.334 --> 00:48:20.007
A couple of kids could never
survive this journey.

735
00:48:23.673 --> 00:48:27.109
That's why I guess I'll just
have to turn you into men.

736
00:48:28.886 --> 00:48:31.639
You can do that? How?

737
00:48:31.972 --> 00:48:34.532
With my mermaid magic.

738
00:48:37.018 --> 00:48:38.417
Did you hear that, Patrick?

739
00:48:38.686 --> 00:48:41.883
She'll use her mermaid magic
to turn us into men!

740
00:48:42.231 --> 00:48:43.584
Hooray!

741
00:48:43.857 --> 00:48:47.327
We're gonna be men! We're gonna
be men! We're gonna be men!

742
00:48:47.819 --> 00:48:49.377
Good. Now, let's get started.

743
00:48:49.654 --> 00:48:50.803
Close your eyes.

744
00:48:51.072 --> 00:48:53.461
- Are we men yet?
- Not yet.

745
00:48:53.782 --> 00:48:54.976
Spin around three times.

746
00:48:55.576 --> 00:48:56.804
I think it's working.

747
00:48:57.702 --> 00:49:00.580
Good. Now, keep your eyes shut.

748
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.957
With my mermaid's magic

749
00:49:03.999 --> 00:49:06.672
and my one tailfin,

750
00:49:07.002 --> 00:49:10.312
I command the two of you
to turn into men!

751
00:49:10.964 --> 00:49:11.919
Open your eyes.

752
00:49:15.843 --> 00:49:20.121
I don't feel any... Oh, my gosh,
Patrick, you have a moustache!

753
00:49:20.514 --> 00:49:21.469
So do you!

754
00:49:25.643 --> 00:49:29.079
So now that you're men,
can you make it to Shell City?

755
00:49:33.108 --> 00:49:34.507
- Guys.
- Yeah?

756
00:49:34.776 --> 00:49:38.166
I said, now that you're men,
can you make it to Shell City?

757
00:49:38.529 --> 00:49:39.484
Heck, yeah!

758
00:49:39.739 --> 00:49:42.412
- Are men afraid of anything?
- Heck, no!

759
00:49:42.741 --> 00:49:43.696
And why?

760
00:49:43.951 --> 00:49:46.101
Because we're invincible!

761
00:49:46.453 --> 00:49:48.171
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

762
00:49:48.663 --> 00:49:50.699
I never said that.

763
00:49:51.165 --> 00:49:52.120
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

764
00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:53.330
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

765
00:49:53.584 --> 00:49:56.223
Yeah! Yeah!

766
00:49:57.337 --> 00:49:59.487
Yeah! Yeah!

767
00:49:59.798 --> 00:50:01.595
Yeah.

768
00:50:04.385 --> 00:50:06.182
- Patrick?
- Yeah, buddy?

769
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.223
Why did we jump over the edge
instead of taking the stairs?

770
00:50:09.556 --> 00:50:11.194
Bec...

771
00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:13.113
Well...

772
00:50:25.695 --> 00:50:28.004
- Patrick.
- Are we dead?

773
00:50:28.322 --> 00:50:30.517
No. Far from it, my friend.

774
00:50:30.825 --> 00:50:33.464
We're safe and sound
at the bottom of this trench.

775
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.638
The moustaches worked!

776
00:50:42.918 --> 00:50:44.670
Do you know what that means?

777
00:50:44.962 --> 00:50:47.681
We are invincible!

778
00:50:51.259 --> 00:50:54.217
<i>Now that we're men
We can do anything</i>

779
00:50:54.595 --> 00:50:58.224
<i>Now that we're men
We are invincible</i>

780
00:50:58.599 --> 00:51:01.989
<i>Now that we're men
We'll go to Shell City</i>

781
00:51:02.352 --> 00:51:05.583
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs</i>

782
00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:07.416
<i>Now that we're men</i>

783
00:51:07.732 --> 00:51:09.643
<i>We have facial hair</i>

784
00:51:09.942 --> 00:51:11.375
<i>Now that we're men</i>

785
00:51:11.652 --> 00:51:13.404
<i>I change my underwear</i>

786
00:51:13.695 --> 00:51:16.971
<i>Now that we're men
We've got a manly flair</i>

787
00:51:17.323 --> 00:51:20.633
<i>We've got the stuff
We're tough enough to save the day</i>

788
00:51:21.285 --> 00:51:23.401
<i>We never had a chance
when we were kids</i>

789
00:51:23.912 --> 00:51:25.345
<i>No! No! No!</i>

790
00:51:25.622 --> 00:51:27.419
<i>But take a look at what
the mermaid did</i>

791
00:51:40.218 --> 00:51:41.697
Yeah, go, Pat.

792
00:51:57.441 --> 00:51:58.954
Oh, yeah.

793
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.566
Yeah, go, SpongeBob.

794
00:52:03.822 --> 00:52:05.414
Hooray!

795
00:52:05.698 --> 00:52:09.373
<i>Now that they're men
We can't bother them</i>

796
00:52:09.744 --> 00:52:13.134
<i>Now that they're men
They have become our friends</i>

797
00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:16.534
<i>Now that they're men
There'll be a happy end</i>

798
00:52:16.875 --> 00:52:20.072
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

799
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.138
<i>They'll pass the test</i>

800
00:52:22.421 --> 00:52:24.013
<i>And finish the quest</i>

801
00:52:24.298 --> 00:52:29.008
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

802
00:52:29.427 --> 00:52:31.258
''Shell City, dead ahead.''

803
00:52:31.554 --> 00:52:32.669
We did it, Pat!

804
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:34.204
We made it past everything!

805
00:52:34.473 --> 00:52:37.431
Even the hideous,
disgusting monsters.

806
00:52:41.438 --> 00:52:42.666
Not you guys.

807
00:52:42.939 --> 00:52:44.292
You guys are awesome!

808
00:52:45.108 --> 00:52:47.827
Well, Patrick, we should be there
in one more verse.

809
00:52:48.152 --> 00:52:50.029
<i>- Now that we're men...
- Finally.</i>

810
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.316
I got you right where I want you.

811
00:52:56.201 --> 00:52:57.680
Can I help you with something, sir?

812
00:52:58.119 --> 00:52:59.598
Name's Dennis.

813
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:02.259
I've been hired to exterminate you.

814
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:06.385
You're gonna exterminate us?

815
00:53:24.725 --> 00:53:25.680
Listen, junior,

816
00:53:25.935 --> 00:53:28.654
you caught me and my friend here
in a good mood today,

817
00:53:28.979 --> 00:53:30.935
so I'm gonna let you off
with a warning.

818
00:53:31.231 --> 00:53:32.869
Step aside,
and you won't have to feel

819
00:53:33.149 --> 00:53:35.583
the awesome wrath
of our moustaches.

820
00:53:36.193 --> 00:53:38.343
You mean these?

821
00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:45.791
I thought you still had a piece of salad
stuck to your lip from lunchtime.

822
00:53:51.665 --> 00:53:53.178
They were fake?

823
00:53:53.458 --> 00:53:55.016
Of course they were fake!

824
00:53:55.293 --> 00:53:58.603
This is what a real moustache
looks like.

825
00:54:02.383 --> 00:54:05.819
- Is he a mermaid?
- All right. Enough gab.

826
00:54:08.847 --> 00:54:10.838
What are you gonna do to us?

827
00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.210
Plankton was very specific.

828
00:54:13.643 --> 00:54:14.598
Plankton?

829
00:54:14.852 --> 00:54:17.366
For some reason,
he wanted me to step on you.

830
00:54:17.688 --> 00:54:19.246
Step on us?

831
00:54:19.523 --> 00:54:23.801
Yeah! That way you'll never find out
that he stole the crown!

832
00:54:26.237 --> 00:54:27.716
Perhaps I've said too much.

833
00:54:35.703 --> 00:54:37.261
That's a big boot.

834
00:54:37.538 --> 00:54:38.493
Don't worry.

835
00:54:38.748 --> 00:54:41.023
This will only hurt a lot.

836
00:54:45.045 --> 00:54:46.956
I love this job!

837
00:54:48.965 --> 00:54:51.115
- Bigger boot!
- Wait, Pat.

838
00:54:51.425 --> 00:54:53.461
This bigger boot saved our lives.

839
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:57.267
Thank you, stranger.

840
00:55:03.394 --> 00:55:05.032
Stranger?

841
00:55:06.397 --> 00:55:08.069
It's the Cyclops!

842
00:55:32.336 --> 00:55:34.406
Help us! Help us!

843
00:55:36.881 --> 00:55:38.792
Save us, someone!

844
00:56:04.739 --> 00:56:06.092
Are we dead?

845
00:56:06.365 --> 00:56:07.764
I don't think so.

846
00:56:08.951 --> 00:56:11.749
Artificially coloured rocks?

847
00:56:14.414 --> 00:56:16.564
I don't know where we are.

848
00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:18.432
What is this?

849
00:56:19.168 --> 00:56:22.046
It's some kind of wall
of psychic energy.

850
00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:26.133
No, Pat, it's a giant glass bowl.

851
00:56:26.508 --> 00:56:28.260
Hey, there's some fish folk.

852
00:56:29.677 --> 00:56:32.066
- Hey, over here!
- Hey! Hey! Hey, you guys!

853
00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:34.856
- You guys, hey! Help!
- Hey! Help!

854
00:56:35.182 --> 00:56:38.458
- A little help here! We're stuck in this...
- Help us out of the tank!

855
00:56:39.185 --> 00:56:40.538
Wait a second.

856
00:56:45.441 --> 00:56:48.160
Those fish are dead.

857
00:57:08.836 --> 00:57:10.315
What's he gonna do with us?

858
00:57:16.342 --> 00:57:20.301
Oh, no, he's going for his
evil instruments of torture.

859
00:57:26.935 --> 00:57:29.051
Glue? Google eyes?

860
00:57:39.946 --> 00:57:43.655
He's making
a humorous diorama of...

861
00:57:45.034 --> 00:57:47.946
...Alexander Clam Bell?

862
00:57:48.287 --> 00:57:52.326
Patrick, he's killing sea animals and
making them into smelly knickknacks.

863
00:57:52.707 --> 00:57:54.425
And I think we're next.

864
00:57:54.834 --> 00:57:58.907
- You think so?
- Patrick! No!

865
00:58:10.806 --> 00:58:15.006
The heat is so intense
from this lamp that I can't move.

866
00:58:15.185 --> 00:58:17.904
The heat is so intense
from this lamp that I can't move.

867
00:58:18.229 --> 00:58:19.628
Tell me about it.

868
00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:33.724
This doesn't look too good, Patrick.

869
00:58:34.076 --> 00:58:35.475
You mean we're not gonna

870
00:58:35.744 --> 00:58:39.976
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs?</i>

871
00:58:40.415 --> 00:58:44.772
I don't even think we're gonna
be able to save ourselves, buddy.

872
00:58:49.089 --> 00:58:51.603
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

873
00:58:51.925 --> 00:58:56.715
Well, it looks like what everybody
said about us is true, Patrick.

874
00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.977
You mean that we're attractive?

875
00:58:59.265 --> 00:59:02.098
No, that we're just kids.

876
00:59:02.434 --> 00:59:05.949
A couple of kids
in way over their heads.

877
00:59:06.313 --> 00:59:08.702
We were doomed from the start.

878
00:59:09.023 --> 00:59:10.581
I mean, look at us.

879
00:59:10.858 --> 00:59:13.418
We didn't even come
close to the crown.

880
00:59:13.736 --> 00:59:15.806
We let everybody down.

881
00:59:16.113 --> 00:59:17.785
We failed.

882
00:59:18.073 --> 00:59:19.552
Shell City.

883
00:59:19.824 --> 00:59:22.736
Yeah, we never made it to Shell City.

884
00:59:23.077 --> 00:59:24.669
Shell City.

885
00:59:24.954 --> 00:59:26.069
Exactly, buddy.

886
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.322
Yeah, the place we never got to.

887
00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:30.735
Shell City.

888
00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:33.151
Okay, now you're starting
to bum me out, Patrick.

889
00:59:33.461 --> 00:59:35.770
No, look at the sign.

890
00:59:36.297 --> 00:59:40.893
''Shell City.
Marine gifts and sundries.''

891
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:44.293
Shell City is a gift shop?

892
00:59:44.637 --> 00:59:49.108
But if this is Shell City,
then where's the...?

893
00:59:51.018 --> 00:59:52.371
- Crown.
- Crown.

894
00:59:54.271 --> 00:59:55.909
Neptune's crown.

895
00:59:56.189 --> 00:59:59.147
This is Shell City.

896
00:59:59.484 --> 01:00:02.476
Pat, we did make it.

897
01:00:03.153 --> 01:00:06.270
Yeah, I guess we did.

898
01:00:08.533 --> 01:00:12.367
We did all right
for a couple of goofballs.

899
01:00:21.836 --> 01:00:27.706
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

900
01:00:28.175 --> 01:00:33.966
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

901
01:00:35.306 --> 01:00:41.381
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

902
01:00:41.854 --> 01:00:48.851
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

903
01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:09.170
That's the end of SpongeBob.

904
01:01:09.544 --> 01:01:11.102
Come here, you.

905
01:01:13.965 --> 01:01:15.637
Shut up and look at the screen.

906
01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:19.257
The bird's right. Look.

907
01:01:19.553 --> 01:01:22.829
It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers.

908
01:01:55.417 --> 01:01:57.373
Hey, we're alive.

909
01:02:03.633 --> 01:02:06.272
- Let's get that crown.
- Right.

910
01:02:07.845 --> 01:02:11.235
On three, Patrick. Ready?
One, two, three.

911
01:02:11.598 --> 01:02:13.748
Hey, it's lighter than I thought.

912
01:02:31.073 --> 01:02:32.711
What's happening?

913
01:02:32.992 --> 01:02:35.745
I don't know. Look!

914
01:03:21.158 --> 01:03:23.194
Come on, Patrick.

915
01:03:23.494 --> 01:03:27.009
Let's get this crown
back to Bikini Bottom.

916
01:03:28.581 --> 01:03:31.573
- Do you still have that bag of winds?
- I sure do.

917
01:03:35.129 --> 01:03:36.721
Here you go.

918
01:03:38.465 --> 01:03:39.420
What?

919
01:03:39.674 --> 01:03:40.948
Nothing. Nothing.

920
01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:42.775
Okay, let's go over the instructions.

921
01:03:44.679 --> 01:03:47.193
Let's see, it says here, ''Step one:
Point bag away from home.''

922
01:03:47.514 --> 01:03:50.745
- Okay.
- ''Step two: Plant feet firmly on ground.''

923
01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:52.739
- Right.
- ''Step three:

924
01:03:53.019 --> 01:03:55.374
Remove string from bag,
releasing the winds.''

925
01:03:55.688 --> 01:03:57.599
Check.

926
01:03:57.898 --> 01:03:59.729
Well, that seems simple enough.

927
01:04:00.025 --> 01:04:02.061
Point bag away from home,
feet firmly on ground,

928
01:04:02.361 --> 01:04:03.874
pull string, releasing the winds.

929
01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:06.224
All right, let's do it for real.

930
01:04:06.531 --> 01:04:08.965
SpongeBob?

931
01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.571
- No, no, stop!
- I was bad, I'm sorry!

932
01:04:13.871 --> 01:04:15.702
- Please, bag.
- I'm sorry, I just thought...

933
01:04:15.997 --> 01:04:18.067
It was a mistake!

934
01:04:23.963 --> 01:04:28.320
Oh, no. How will we ever get
back to Bikini Bottom now?

935
01:04:28.717 --> 01:04:29.945
I can take you there.

936
01:04:39.226 --> 01:04:42.059
- Who are you?
- I'm David Hasselhoff.

937
01:04:42.395 --> 01:04:43.908
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

938
01:04:45.898 --> 01:04:47.047
So where's your boat?

939
01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.075
Boat?

940
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:57.386
- Go, Hasselhoff.
- Next stop, Bikini Bottom.

941
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:03.024
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

942
01:05:03.413 --> 01:05:07.042
Well, Krabs,
you know what today is?

943
01:05:07.417 --> 01:05:09.055
Sorry about this, calendar.

944
01:05:09.335 --> 01:05:10.927
March 14.

945
01:05:11.212 --> 01:05:12.804
Wait, that's not right.

946
01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:17.207
It should say
''The day that Krabs fries.''

947
01:05:23.639 --> 01:05:25.470
Guess who's here.

948
01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:41.888
Hooray for Hasselhoff!
Nothing can stop us now.

949
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:46.068
Unidentified object
off the hindquarters.

950
01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:49.655
It looks like...

951
01:05:50.454 --> 01:05:51.853
...bigger boot.

952
01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:53.999
But how?

953
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.375
Dennis!

954
01:06:04.633 --> 01:06:06.032
Did you miss me?

955
01:06:11.139 --> 01:06:13.528
This is the best seat in the house.

956
01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:17.888
All right, Neptune, let's get it on.

957
01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:21.819
Eugene Krabs,
your six-day reprieve is up,

958
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:25.546
and it is time for you to die.

959
01:06:25.902 --> 01:06:28.974
Please, I didn't do it.

960
01:06:29.321 --> 01:06:31.915
There is nothing else I can do.

961
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.515
You can give SpongeBob and Patrick
a little more time.

962
01:06:34.826 --> 01:06:39.297
Except give SpongeBob and Patrick
a little more time...

963
01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:42.060
What? Mindy, will you butt out.

964
01:06:42.374 --> 01:06:44.968
I won't have you stalling
this execution.

965
01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:47.853
Stalling? I'm not stalling anything.

966
01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.923
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

967
01:06:50.214 --> 01:06:53.331
Yes, you are.
You're doing it right now.

968
01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.554
- I'm stalling.
- Yes.

969
01:06:56.887 --> 01:06:58.525
- Stalling?
- Stalling!

970
01:06:58.972 --> 01:07:01.486
- Stalling.
- Stalling!

971
01:07:01.808 --> 01:07:02.843
Oh, boy.

972
01:07:06.687 --> 01:07:08.723
Now, where were we?

973
01:07:09.022 --> 01:07:11.172
- Patrick, run.
- No.

974
01:07:11.483 --> 01:07:12.882
I'm tired of running.

975
01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:16.826
If we run now, we'll never stop...

976
01:07:17.696 --> 01:07:19.732
Run, SpongeBob!

977
01:07:26.371 --> 01:07:28.726
Take it easy back there, fellas.

978
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.598
SpongeBob, be careful.

979
01:07:38.881 --> 01:07:40.917
Come on, kid, give it up.

980
01:07:41.884 --> 01:07:43.602
Dennis always gets his man.

981
01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:45.527
Never!

982
01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.441
Yeah! I did it!

983
01:07:55.729 --> 01:07:57.447
You got guts, kid.

984
01:07:57.731 --> 01:07:59.369
Too bad I gotta rip them out of you.

985
01:07:59.649 --> 01:08:01.526
I don't know what Plankton's
paying you,

986
01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:04.378
but if you let us go,
I can make it worth your while.

987
01:08:04.695 --> 01:08:06.925
It's gonna take a lot more than 5...

988
01:08:07.239 --> 01:08:10.675
- What is this?
- That, sir, is five Goober dollars.

989
01:08:11.034 --> 01:08:14.071
Legal tender at any participating
Goofy Goober...

990
01:08:14.412 --> 01:08:16.846
I got bubbles. Fun at parties.

991
01:08:17.582 --> 01:08:19.379
My eyes.

992
01:08:19.667 --> 01:08:21.464
I got you, SpongeBob.

993
01:08:21.752 --> 01:08:23.629
Thanks, buddy.

994
01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:24.989
Thanks a lot.

995
01:08:25.255 --> 01:08:26.768
That's it.

996
01:08:27.048 --> 01:08:28.640
I'm through messing around.

997
01:08:28.925 --> 01:08:31.439
See you later, fools.

998
01:08:38.516 --> 01:08:40.154
See you.

999
01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.369
So you think...

1000
01:08:43.688 --> 01:08:45.758
...I'm...

1001
01:08:46.065 --> 01:08:48.260
...stalling.

1002
01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:50.444
Where am I, in Crazytown?

1003
01:08:50.735 --> 01:08:54.808
I have had enough of this nonsense!

1004
01:08:55.197 --> 01:09:00.396
You are to wait in the carriage
until the execution is done.

1005
01:09:01.953 --> 01:09:04.387
- But, Daddy...
- Now!

1006
01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:09.145
No, no, no!

1007
01:09:09.418 --> 01:09:12.137
Oh, SpongeBob, wherever you are,
you better hurry.

1008
01:09:14.798 --> 01:09:18.837
Okay, fellas, this is where you get off.
Bikini Bottom's directly below.

1009
01:09:19.218 --> 01:09:21.493
But we'll never be able
to float down in time.

1010
01:09:21.804 --> 01:09:24.398
Who said anything about floating?

1011
01:09:25.182 --> 01:09:28.458
<i>- lnitiating launch sequence.
- What the...?</i>

1012
01:09:30.478 --> 01:09:33.709
- Did you see that?
- The control.

1013
01:09:35.357 --> 01:09:37.587
All hands on deck.

1014
01:09:38.693 --> 01:09:42.288
<i>Ten seconds to lift-off. Nine, eight...</i>

1015
01:09:42.655 --> 01:09:46.614
Eugene Krabs, the time has come...

1016
01:09:46.992 --> 01:09:48.550
- No.
- Yes.

1017
01:09:48.827 --> 01:09:50.465
<i>...six, five...</i>

1018
01:09:50.746 --> 01:09:51.701
...for you...

1019
01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:53.513
- No.
- Yes.

1020
01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.303
<i>...three, two...</i>

1021
01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:57.141
- ...to fry.
- No.

1022
01:09:57.418 --> 01:09:59.648
<i>- Yes.
- ...one.</i>

1023
01:10:04.257 --> 01:10:05.736
No!

1024
01:10:08.678 --> 01:10:11.317
You done good, Hasselhoff.
You done...

1025
01:10:16.851 --> 01:10:18.887
Hooray! We made it.

1026
01:10:19.187 --> 01:10:21.542
We made it.

1027
01:10:26.443 --> 01:10:28.718
My crown.

1028
01:10:29.029 --> 01:10:32.704
My beautiful crown!

1029
01:10:34.533 --> 01:10:38.572
SpongeBob? Patrick?
I knew you could do it.

1030
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.618
Oh, yes. Well done, SpongeBoob.

1031
01:10:52.341 --> 01:10:55.060
Sorry to rain
on your parade, Plankton.

1032
01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.580
Oh, don't worry about me.

1033
01:10:57.887 --> 01:11:03.359
My parade shall be quite dry
under my umbrella!

1034
01:11:03.809 --> 01:11:06.118
Umbrella?

1035
01:11:11.649 --> 01:11:12.718
Daddy, no.

1036
01:11:12.983 --> 01:11:15.258
Daddy, yes.

1037
01:11:19.447 --> 01:11:22.245
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

1038
01:11:24.118 --> 01:11:28.987
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1039
01:11:29.414 --> 01:11:35.728
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1040
01:11:37.171 --> 01:11:38.763
SpongeBob, what happened?

1041
01:11:39.048 --> 01:11:41.004
- Plankton cheated.
- Cheated?

1042
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.450
Hold on there, baldy.

1043
01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.829
Oh, grow up.

1044
01:11:45.095 --> 01:11:48.167
What, you think this is a game
of kickball on the playground?

1045
01:11:48.514 --> 01:11:51.551
You never had a chance
to defeat me, fool.

1046
01:11:51.892 --> 01:11:53.291
And you know why?

1047
01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.993
Because you cheated?

1048
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:58.899
No, not because I cheated.
Because I'm an evil genius.

1049
01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:01.310
And you're just a kid.

1050
01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.418
A stupid kid.

1051
01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:12.680
I guess you're right, Plankton.
I am just a kid.

1052
01:12:13.035 --> 01:12:15.469
Of course I'm right.
Okay, Neptune, time to kill.

1053
01:12:15.788 --> 01:12:18.746
And you know, I've been through
a lot in the past six days,

1054
01:12:19.082 --> 01:12:21.550
five minutes,
27-and-a-half seconds.

1055
01:12:21.876 --> 01:12:24.470
And if I've learned anything
during that time,

1056
01:12:24.796 --> 01:12:26.991
it's that you are who you are.

1057
01:12:27.298 --> 01:12:32.372
- That's right. Okay, Neptune...
- And no amount of mermaid magic...

1058
01:12:32.803 --> 01:12:36.273
...or managerial promotion...

1059
01:12:36.639 --> 01:12:38.357
...or some other third thing...

1060
01:12:38.641 --> 01:12:41.951
...can make me anything more
than what I really am inside:

1061
01:12:42.478 --> 01:12:44.196
- A kid.
- That's great.

1062
01:12:44.479 --> 01:12:46.674
- Now, get back against the wall.
- But that's okay.

1063
01:12:46.981 --> 01:12:48.653
- What? What's going on?
- Because I did

1064
01:12:48.942 --> 01:12:50.898
what everyone said
a kid couldn't do.

1065
01:12:51.193 --> 01:12:54.469
I made it to Shell City,
and I beat the Cyclops,

1066
01:12:54.822 --> 01:12:58.815
and I rode the Hasselhoff,
and I brought the crown back.

1067
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.953
- All right, we get the point.
- So, yeah, I'm a kid.

1068
01:13:02.286 --> 01:13:04.595
And I'm also a goofball.
And a wing nut.

1069
01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:06.950
And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!

1070
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.355
- What's going on here?
- But most of all, I'm...

1071
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:13.308
- Okay, settle down. Take it easy.
- I'm... I'm...

1072
01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:14.745
What the scallop?!

1073
01:13:15.006 --> 01:13:16.234
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober</i>

1074
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:20.989
<i>You're a Goofy Goober</i>

1075
01:13:23.346 --> 01:13:26.099
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers</i>

1076
01:13:28.309 --> 01:13:31.506
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober</i>

1077
01:13:34.106 --> 01:13:36.700
<i>Put your toys away
Well, all I gotta say</i>

1078
01:13:37.025 --> 01:13:38.743
<i>When you tell me not to play
I say no way</i>

1079
01:13:39.027 --> 01:13:41.700
<i>- No way!
- No, no freaking way</i>

1080
01:13:43.197 --> 01:13:45.665
<i>I'm a kid, you say
When you say I'm a kid</i>

1081
01:13:45.991 --> 01:13:47.743
<i>I say, ''Say it again''
And then I say thanks</i>

1082
01:13:48.034 --> 01:13:50.502
<i>- Thanks!
- Thank you very much</i>

1083
01:13:52.538 --> 01:13:56.008
<i>So if you're thinking
That you'd like to be like me</i>

1084
01:13:56.375 --> 01:13:59.845
<i>Go ahead and try
The kid inside will set you free</i>

1085
01:14:04.632 --> 01:14:05.951
<i>I'm a Goofy Goober</i>

1086
01:14:09.136 --> 01:14:10.694
What's happening?

1087
01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:17.349
His dance moves are impressive,
but I'm in control.

1088
01:14:17.727 --> 01:14:21.276
<i>- Seize him!
- All hail Plankton.</i>

1089
01:14:49.004 --> 01:14:51.199
I'm free. I've been freed!

1090
01:14:51.506 --> 01:14:53.019
What?

1091
01:14:54.092 --> 01:14:55.320
No!

1092
01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.328
My precious helmets!

1093
01:15:20.531 --> 01:15:22.567
His chops are too righteous.

1094
01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:26.575
The helmets can't handle
this level of rock 'n' roll.

1095
01:15:26.953 --> 01:15:29.308
Karen, do something.

1096
01:15:29.789 --> 01:15:31.268
Karen?

1097
01:15:34.543 --> 01:15:36.818
All right, that's the last straw.

1098
01:15:37.129 --> 01:15:40.405
Neptune, I command you to...

1099
01:15:41.633 --> 01:15:44.784
- Here you go, Daddy.
- I better get out of here.

1100
01:15:45.928 --> 01:15:48.158
Look, it's the wizard who saved us.

1101
01:15:48.472 --> 01:15:50.463
Out of my way, fools.

1102
01:16:02.734 --> 01:16:05.567
Come on, I was just kidding.

1103
01:16:06.488 --> 01:16:09.924
Come on, you guys knew that,
didn't you?

1104
01:16:11.742 --> 01:16:13.380
With the helmets
and the big monuments...

1105
01:16:13.827 --> 01:16:16.136
Wasn't that hilarious, everybody?

1106
01:16:16.455 --> 01:16:18.969
I will destroy all of you!

1107
01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:22.764
Well, Mindy, I have to admit,
you were right.

1108
01:16:23.127 --> 01:16:25.038
Your compassion
for these sea creatures

1109
01:16:25.337 --> 01:16:27.055
proved a most admirable trait.

1110
01:16:27.339 --> 01:16:31.776
Without it, I would have never
again seen my beloved crown.

1111
01:16:32.176 --> 01:16:35.725
I think you're going to make a fine
ruler of the sea one day.

1112
01:16:36.097 --> 01:16:37.974
- Now, let's go home.
- Daddy,

1113
01:16:38.265 --> 01:16:39.823
haven't you forgotten something?

1114
01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.375
What? Oh, yeah.

1115
01:16:43.061 --> 01:16:47.259
Eugene Krabs,
I forgot to unfreeze you.

1116
01:16:50.192 --> 01:16:51.591
What the...?

1117
01:16:52.819 --> 01:16:54.730
I guess I had it set to
''real boy'' ending.

1118
01:16:59.325 --> 01:17:02.920
Oh, I'm sorry
for falsely freezing you, Krabs.

1119
01:17:03.287 --> 01:17:06.677
And may I say, sir,
you are a very lucky fellow

1120
01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.918
to have in your employ
such a brave, faithful

1121
01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:12.970
and heroic young lad.

1122
01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.629
- Where is he, anyway?
- I'm up here.

1123
01:17:21.427 --> 01:17:22.940
I'm on it.

1124
01:17:26.765 --> 01:17:29.233
Go to him now, Krabs.
Embrace him.

1125
01:17:30.018 --> 01:17:33.772
SpongeBob, me boy,
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

1126
01:17:34.147 --> 01:17:35.978
That's a mistake I won't make again.

1127
01:17:36.274 --> 01:17:39.311
Oh, Mr. Krabs, you old soft-serve.

1128
01:17:39.652 --> 01:17:42.530
And now, SpongeBob,
I'm gonna do something

1129
01:17:42.863 --> 01:17:45.252
that I should've done six days ago.

1130
01:17:45.573 --> 01:17:48.645
Mr. Squidward,
front and centre, please.

1131
01:17:48.993 --> 01:17:53.669
I think we all know who rightfully
deserves to wear that manager pin.

1132
01:17:54.081 --> 01:17:56.231
I couldn't agree more, sir.

1133
01:17:56.541 --> 01:17:58.930
Hooray for SpongeBob!

1134
01:18:02.588 --> 01:18:04.146
Wait a second, everybody.

1135
01:18:04.423 --> 01:18:06.414
There's something I need to say first.

1136
01:18:06.717 --> 01:18:08.435
I just don't know how to put it.

1137
01:18:08.718 --> 01:18:10.868
I think I know what it is.

1138
01:18:11.179 --> 01:18:13.977
After going on
your life-changing journey,

1139
01:18:14.307 --> 01:18:18.539
you now realize you don't want
what you thought you wanted.

1140
01:18:18.936 --> 01:18:24.010
What you really wanted
was inside you all along.

1141
01:18:24.691 --> 01:18:28.001
Are you crazy? I was just gonna
tell you that your fly is down.

1142
01:18:28.527 --> 01:18:32.361
Manager! This is
the greatest day of my life!

1143
01:26:30.486 --> 01:26:32.556
You know, David Hasselhoff
is a great artist.

1144
01:26:32.863 --> 01:26:34.091
Excuse me, sir.

1145
01:26:35.616 --> 01:26:36.810
You folks have to leave.

1146
01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:42.160
What? Say that again, if you dare.

1147
01:26:42.538 --> 01:26:44.654
You folks have to leave.

1148
01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.377
Okay.
