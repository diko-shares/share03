27

I'm Terry West.
What's your name?

28
00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.087
Priscilla Beaulieu.

29
00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:42.690
I see you come in here a lot.
Is your family stationed here?

30
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.125
Yes.

31
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.793
Where are you from?

32
00:03:45.893 --> 00:03:47.595
Uh, Texas.

33
00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:50.330
My dad just transferred here
in August.

34
00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:52.166
That so?

35
00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.901
Well, how do you like Germany?

36
00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:55.970
Mmm.

37
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.741
I book the entertainment here.
My wife plays here sometimes.

38
00:04:00.742 --> 00:04:02.242
Neat.

39
00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.078
Do you like Elvis Presley?

40
00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:08.248
Of course. Who doesn't?

41
00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.650
Well, I'm a friend of his.

42
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:11.919
My wife and I go to his house
when he has people over.

43
00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.555
He's always glad to see
folks from back home.

44
00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.524
We're going this weekend,
if you want to join.

45
00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:22.764
Have to ask my parents.

46
00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:23.998
Well, all right.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:26.501

They'd pick me up
and drop me off.

52
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:53.360
You wanna go with strangers
to Elvis Presley's house?

53
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.229
Absolutely not.

54
00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:57.064
There'd be other people
there too.

55
00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.968
It's the weekend,
why can't I go?

56
00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:02.469
I'd be with Terry and his wife.

57
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.572
-We don't know them.
-Who are these people?

58
00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:06.841
No.

59
00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:13.080
There's nothing
to do here.

60
00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:22.156
Hello, Captain.
I'm Terry West.

61
00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:24.324
Good to meet you.
This is my wife, Ann.

62
00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.627
-Hello.
-Hi. I book the music here.

63
00:05:26.727 --> 00:05:29.362
My wife Carol and I
are friends with Elvis.

64
00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.699
He's having people over.
Your daughter's welcome to come.

65
00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:33.701
She said I'd have to ask you.

66
00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.503
I see.

67
00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.470
What unit are you in?

68
00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:39.307
Stationed under
Sergeant Bryant, sir.

69
00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:40.975
-Bryant, huh?
-Yes, sir.

70
00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:42.743
Still tough as nails?

71
00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:45.378
Yes, sir.
If you have any tips...

72
00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:47.181
No, there's no shortcuts, son.

73
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:48.983
Well, your daughter'd be
well chaperoned

74
00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:50.151
by my wife and myself.

75
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:52.485
The house is just off base.
I could pick her up at 8:30

76
00:05:52.587 --> 00:05:54.956
and have her back
by any time you say, sir.

77
00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.123
We'll discuss it.

78
00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:06.767
That one's pretty.

79
00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:09.436
It's my Easter dress,
I can't wear this.

80
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.540
I hope you have fun tonight.

81
00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:15.543
I'm sorry it's been so hard
on you here

82
00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:18.579
but I know you'll make
some new friends soon.

83
00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:20.480
I don't want new friends.

84
00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:24.518
I know.

85
00:06:25.987 --> 00:06:27.555
They'll be here soon.

86
00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:53.781
All right, let's go.

87
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:55.883
C'mon, honey, c'mon.

88
00:06:55.983 --> 00:06:57.450
Excited?

89
00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:59.687
Excuse me.
Here we go.

90
00:07:04.358 --> 00:07:05.793

So, what are you
doing over here?

107
00:07:57.044 --> 00:08:00.480
My dad's stationed in, uh,
Wiesbaden.

108
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:03.117

-Austin, Texas.

113

-Hi.
-Hello.

151
00:10:47.047 --> 00:10:48.849
When I was a kid,
I hit a ball straight at her

152
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:50.985
and she dodged it,
so ever since then

153
00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:53.053
she's always...
She's been Dodger.

154
00:10:53.154 --> 00:10:56.056
Yeah, you almost
got yourself a whippin'!

155
00:10:56.157 --> 00:10:57.825
This is my buddy, Joe,
from back home.

156
00:10:57.925 --> 00:10:59.760
-Nice to meet you.
-Always stuffing his face.

157
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.163
-I don't like schnitzel.
-C'mon.

158
00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.374
So, uh, so what... What...

159
00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:16.043
What are the kids back home
listening to these days?

160
00:11:16.777 --> 00:11:19.648
Mmm... Bobby Darin.

00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:21.348
Oh, no.

162
00:11:22.283 --> 00:11:23.951
And Fabian...

163
00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:26.887
And you.

00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:30.157
Well, that's good, I...

165
00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:32.126

you got a favorite song?

168
00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:41.001

171
00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:49.743
Wow.

172
00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:51.745
Well...

173
00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:55.449
What do you say maybe
we go somewhere more quiet?

174
00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:00.854
Would you come up to my room?

175
00:12:01.755 --> 00:12:03.224
You don't have to
be scared, baby.

176
00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:06.393
I'd never do anything
to harm you. I'm just...

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:16.237
We just go up the stairs,

180
00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:18.640
it's gonna be
the first door on your right.

181
00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:20.341
I'll meet you up there, okay?

182
00:12:21.242 --> 00:12:22.343
Okay.

183
00:12:23.177 --> 00:12:24.478
All right.

184
00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:30.384
You about ready to go?

185
00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:33.187
Soon, Dee.

186
00:13:05.152 --> 00:13:07.021
So, what else is going on
back home?

187
00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:13.394
I don't think
things have changed that much.

188
00:13:13.494 --> 00:13:15.095
Hmm.

189
00:13:18.032 --> 00:13:21.135
It's really nice
to talk to someone from home.

190
00:13:22.303 --> 00:13:24.773
And, uh, I know
a lot of girls here and...

191
00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:27.141
And none of them
are from the States.

192
00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:33.347
I wish my mama could've met you.

193
00:13:34.616 --> 00:13:36.483
She, uh...

194
00:13:36.584 --> 00:13:38.352
She passed on just last August.

195
00:13:41.623 --> 00:13:43.190
She would've really liked you.

196
00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:47.428
I wish I could have met her.

197
00:13:47.529 --> 00:13:49.997
She's my whole world,
my mama, and, uh...

198
00:13:50.097 --> 00:13:51.865
I talk to her every day.

199
00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:55.436
And now Dee's got her grips
on my daddy.

200
00:13:55.537 --> 00:13:57.471
He's under her spell.
She's trying to turn him

201
00:13:57.572 --> 00:13:59.541
into something he's not.

202
00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:02.976
I don't know how I'm gonna go
back to Graceland without her.

203
00:14:03.077 --> 00:14:05.012
That's the... That's the home
that I bought for her.

204
00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:08.382
I'm just...

205
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:11.285
I just really miss her.

206
00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:18.292
I've been so homesick.

207
00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:24.532

Priscilla, don't speak to us
like that.

00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:50.618
He just lost his mother
and he's still grieving.

229
00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:52.654
He trusts me.

230
00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:18.078
-Afternoon, sir.
-How are you, son? C'mon in.

231
00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:19.848
That can be tough
this time of year.

232
00:16:19.948 --> 00:16:21.281
No kidding, sir.
We, uh...

233
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:23.484
We've had some
pretty cold nights out there.

234
00:16:23.585 --> 00:16:25.653
Guess you're looking forward
to getting home?

235
00:16:25.753 --> 00:16:27.655
Yes, sir.

236
00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.657
Mmm-hmm.

237
00:16:29.757 --> 00:16:31.659
All right. Here you go.

238
00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:34.529
Well, thank you, ma'am.

239
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:36.931
Just what is the intent here,
Mr. Presley?

240
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.465
Well, let's face it,
you're Elvis Presley.

241
00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:41.468
You got women
throwing themselves at you.

242
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.137
Why my daughter?

243
00:16:45.607 --> 00:16:48.375
Well, sir, I happen to be
very fond of your daughter.

244
00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.645
Uh, she's much more mature
than her age

245
00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:53.548
and I really do enjoy
spending time with her.

246
00:16:53.648 --> 00:16:56.918
I have to admit, you know,
it hasn't been easy for me

247
00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:59.052

248
00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:01.321
But you don't have to worry
about her, Captain.

249
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.257
Look, son,

250
00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:05.158
you'll need to
pick her up yourself.

251
00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:07.294
Yes, sir.

252
00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:09.764

put myself into, you know?

282
00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:44.124

352
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:56.317
-Here, let me take your things.
-Thank you.

353
00:26:56.417 --> 00:26:58.587
-Well, you made it!
-Yeah.

354
00:26:58.686 --> 00:27:01.055
-Did you have a good trip?
-Yes.

355
00:27:01.155 --> 00:27:03.592
I bet you would like
a lemonade.

356
00:27:05.092 --> 00:27:07.228
And the boys are just
right down there.

357
00:27:09.196 --> 00:27:10.532
Ooh!

358
00:27:10.631 --> 00:27:12.967
That's a good shot.

359
00:27:14.935 --> 00:27:17.338
I see her.
There she is!

360
00:27:17.438 --> 00:27:19.140
Let me get a good look at you.

361
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.942
Hi. Come on. Mmm-mmm.

362
00:27:22.042 --> 00:27:23.844
Where you been all my life?
Let me see you.

363
00:27:23.944 --> 00:27:25.547
Let me see you.
You look beautiful.

364
00:27:25.646 --> 00:27:27.848
Oh, you look beautiful.

365
00:27:27.948 --> 00:27:29.483
-Thank you.
-You gotta meet the guys.

366
00:27:29.584 --> 00:27:32.621
This is Hog Ears. You know Joe.
And then the rest of 'em.

367
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.222
-Nice to see you again.
-Hi.

368
00:27:35.456 --> 00:27:37.124
Jerry. A pleasure.

369
00:27:40.194 --> 00:27:42.429
O-Five, this here is, uh,
this here is Priscilla.

370
00:27:42.531 --> 00:27:43.931
Hello.

371
00:27:44.031 --> 00:27:46.300
Pleased to meet you, honey.
I'm Alberta.

372
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.202
Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

373
00:27:48.302 --> 00:27:51.672
And we heard plenty about you.

374
00:27:51.772 --> 00:27:55.042
Boys, help yourselves.
Dig in, dig in.

375
00:27:55.809 --> 00:27:57.178
Leave some for Priscilla.

376
00:27:57.278 --> 00:27:59.581
-Hi. You hungry?
-It's beautiful here. No.

377
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.282
You like it?

378
00:28:04.285 --> 00:28:06.687
I keep trying to tell him
to take me shopping.

379
00:28:06.787 --> 00:28:08.856
And he won't
take you shopping?
- Well...

380
00:28:08.956 --> 00:28:11.192
No, I take her,
I just... I just stand there.

381
00:28:11.292 --> 00:28:12.893
You tired?

382
00:28:13.427 --> 00:28:15.162
A little bit.

383
00:28:15.262 --> 00:28:16.665
Hmm.

384
00:28:16.764 --> 00:28:19.133
Why don't you go head upstairs?
I'll meet you.

385
00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:21.802
It's just, uh, it's just
the first door on your left.

386
00:28:32.246 --> 00:28:35.015
- Oh, what up? What up?
- Oh, this is serious.

387
00:28:35.115 --> 00:28:37.751
-Hey, boss, this is Evelyn.
-Evelyn? Who's Evelyn?

388
00:28:37.851 --> 00:28:40.154
Nice to meet you.

389
00:28:41.989 --> 00:28:43.791
Wow, she's young, huh?

390
00:28:44.825 --> 00:28:47.629
She's like a little girl.

391
00:29:23.297 --> 00:29:25.766
Don't let me sleep
no later than 3:00 tomorrow.

392
00:29:25.866 --> 00:29:27.501
You got it, boss.

393
00:29:31.438 --> 00:29:32.906
Where are you, baby?

394
00:29:33.007 --> 00:29:35.510
I'm here.
I'll be just a few minutes.

395
00:29:36.544 --> 00:29:37.845
All right. Don't take too long.

396
00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:39.813
I wanna see my girl.

397
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.079
You don't know
how much I missed you.

398
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:17.084
I haven't been able to get you
out of my head since Germany.

399
00:30:21.488 --> 00:30:23.257
You're the one thing
that kept me going.

400
00:30:41.208 --> 00:30:45.045
Wait, hold on, baby,
things can get out of hand.

401
00:30:45.145 --> 00:30:47.314
What? Is there something wrong?

402
00:30:47.414 --> 00:30:48.882
Just...

403
00:30:48.982 --> 00:30:50.585
Just not yet.

404
00:30:53.153 --> 00:30:54.888
There'll be a right time.

405
00:31:06.735 --> 00:31:09.269
Here, you can take one of these.

406
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.438
It'll help you sleep
after your trip.

407
00:31:28.288 --> 00:31:29.423
Come here.

408
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.905
Priscilla?

409
00:31:45.472 --> 00:31:46.674
Priscilla?

410
00:31:47.742 --> 00:31:49.677
Priscilla, hon.

411
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.945
It's Grandma.

412
00:31:52.045 --> 00:31:53.380
What did you give this young'un?

413
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.115
You've got no business
givin' her something

414
00:31:55.215 --> 00:31:56.751
that she's not used to.

415
00:31:56.851 --> 00:31:58.919
You know how long
she's been like this?

416
00:31:59.019 --> 00:32:00.988
You need to call the doctor.

417
00:32:02.089 --> 00:32:04.124
I dunno, she's wakin' up.

418
00:32:04.224 --> 00:32:06.561
- I'll get her some water.
- Mmm...

419
00:32:07.762 --> 00:32:10.130
-Where am I?
-Hi, baby.

420
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.232
Baby, we've been
trying to wake you up.

421
00:32:13.066 --> 00:32:14.702
I just went to bed.

422
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:18.439
No, baby, you've been out
for two days.

423
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.776
On a goddamn 500 milligram
Placidyl. I... I...

424
00:32:21.876 --> 00:32:24.679
I must have been out of my head
givin' it to you that way.

425
00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:26.447
Mmm, mmm...

426
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.415
Mmm, two days?

427
00:32:32.052 --> 00:32:34.288
Well, that's two days
off my trip.

428
00:32:35.623 --> 00:32:37.458
It's fine, you don't
have to worry about it.

429
00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:39.126
We got plenty of time.

430
00:32:40.194 --> 00:32:41.995
So, how'd you
like to go to Vegas?

431
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:45.867
Vegas?

432
00:33:50.932 --> 00:33:53.801
Twenty-one!

433
00:33:53.902 --> 00:33:57.505
I'm sorry, baby, that's 22.
That's 22. That's a bust.

434
00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:00.842
-Oh.
-Cilla, baby.

435
00:34:15.857 --> 00:34:17.424
- Whoo!
- Oh!

436
00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.697
Good for you, young lady.

437
00:34:22.797 --> 00:34:24.398
Whoo!

438
00:35:12.614 --> 00:35:15.382
Baby, I hate to say it,
but our time is up.

439
00:35:15.482 --> 00:35:18.485
No, I'm not going back.

440
00:35:18.586 --> 00:35:20.187
I'll call my parents
and tell them

441
00:35:20.287 --> 00:35:21.689
that I missed the flight.

442
00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:23.725
You really think
they're gonna believe that?

443
00:35:24.525 --> 00:35:26.126
Then I'll tell them the truth.

444
00:35:26.226 --> 00:35:27.862
That I love you
and I'm not going back.

445
00:35:27.962 --> 00:35:31.264
Baby, that's just gonna
make it worse for next time.

446
00:35:31.365 --> 00:35:34.134
I gotta go do another film,
so, if you go back

447
00:35:34.234 --> 00:35:35.803
and you do well in school
maybe your parents

448
00:35:35.903 --> 00:35:37.505
will let you come back.

449
00:35:38.706 --> 00:35:40.074
Yes, but when?

450
00:35:40.173 --> 00:35:42.209
We'll sort it out. Come here.

451
00:36:01.863 --> 00:36:03.263
What?

452
00:36:56.017 --> 00:36:57.417
Why you?

453
00:36:57.518 --> 00:36:59.352
Why can't he find someone
his own age?

454
00:36:59.453 --> 00:37:00.988
You're only 17.

455
00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:02.924
He's not like you imagine.

456
00:37:04.525 --> 00:37:06.828
And he needs me, Mom!

457
00:37:06.928 --> 00:37:09.030
I won't get hurt.

458
00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.932
Please, just talk to Dad.

459
00:37:11.032 --> 00:37:13.835
I only have a few more
credits left to graduate.

460
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.705
Please.

461
00:37:20.508 --> 00:37:22.309
All right.

462
00:37:24.879 --> 00:37:26.446
Now help me with these.

463
00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:29.550
<i>Sir,</i>

464
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:31.719
<i>I promise to enroll her</i>
<i>in a good Catholic school</i>

465
00:37:31.819 --> 00:37:34.589
<i>and I'll make sure</i>
<i>she graduates.</i>

466
00:37:34.689 --> 00:37:36.758
<i>She'll live with my father</i>
<i>and Dee</i>

467
00:37:36.858 --> 00:37:38.760
<i>and have a chaperone</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

468
00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.393
-Mmm-hmm <i>.</i>
<i>-And my grandmother</i>

469
00:37:40.494 --> 00:37:43.598
<i>and my cousin Patsy</i>
<i>are here, too.</i>

470
00:37:43.698 --> 00:37:45.967
<i>She'll be looked after</i>
<i>as part of the family here.</i>

471
00:37:47.367 --> 00:37:49.436
<i>I love your daughter</i>
<i>and I can assure you</i>

472
00:37:49.537 --> 00:37:52.339
<i>that my intentions</i>
<i>are honorable, sir.</i>

473
00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:53.941
Well, I appreciate
the call, son.

474
00:37:54.041 --> 00:37:55.576
Bye-bye.

475
00:38:00.948 --> 00:38:02.884
She's gotta forget about him.

476
00:38:02.984 --> 00:38:06.254
And what if she doesn't?
Then she'll never forgive us.

477
00:38:06.353 --> 00:38:08.055
She's gotta finish school.

478
00:38:08.156 --> 00:38:09.456
I know...

479
00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:11.993
But what are we gonna do?

480
00:38:12.093 --> 00:38:13.528
She said
if we don't let her go,

481
00:38:13.628 --> 00:38:15.696
she's going to find a way
to get there on her own.

482
00:38:15.797 --> 00:38:17.732
She's not gonna get there
on her own.

483
00:38:21.836 --> 00:38:23.204
Welcome.

484
00:38:33.514 --> 00:38:34.949
Oh, Priscilla.

485
00:38:35.049 --> 00:38:37.417
- Sorry Elvis's shoot's delayed.
- He'll be back soon.

486
00:38:37.518 --> 00:38:39.086
I'll take her
for school registration

487
00:38:39.187 --> 00:38:40.521
just as soon as she's settled.

488
00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:43.024
This girl will be
well looked after.

489
00:38:43.124 --> 00:38:44.692
Thank you.

490
00:38:53.433 --> 00:38:55.002
Please don't worry.

491
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.773
I'll be fine.

492
00:40:11.646 --> 00:40:14.348
Okay, so we'll pick that up
on Friday?

493
00:40:14.447 --> 00:40:16.350
-Oh, hi, Priscilla.
-Hello.

494
00:40:16.449 --> 00:40:18.319
I'm Patsy, this is Becky.

495
00:40:18.418 --> 00:40:20.755
-Hi.
-We run the office here.

496
00:40:20.855 --> 00:40:23.291
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

497
00:40:23.391 --> 00:40:24.926
Us too.

498
00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:27.762
Elvis left a gift for you
on the back patio.

499
00:40:27.862 --> 00:40:29.297
Oh, okay.

500
00:40:29.397 --> 00:40:31.599
You give us a holler
if you need anything.

501
00:40:31.699 --> 00:40:33.768
Okay, thank you. Bye.

502
00:40:37.138 --> 00:40:38.806
Hello!

503
00:40:39.307 --> 00:40:41.474
Who are you? Hi.

504
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.878
Hey, little one!

505
00:40:44.378 --> 00:40:45.980
Happy dog.

506
00:40:52.887 --> 00:40:54.689
<i>How's my girl?</i>

507
00:40:54.789 --> 00:40:57.490
I just can't believe
I'm really here.

508
00:40:58.726 --> 00:41:01.262
<i>Yeah, I only have</i>
<i>a little longer on this shoot</i>

509
00:41:01.362 --> 00:41:02.830
<i>and then I'll be home.</i>

510
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.497
<i>Is everyone</i>
<i>taking good care of you?</i>

511
00:41:04.598 --> 00:41:07.902
Yes. Everyone's been
really nice.

512
00:41:08.002 --> 00:41:10.004
<i>- All right, that's good.</i>
<i>Elvis,</i>
<i>they're ready for you!</i>

513
00:41:10.104 --> 00:41:12.506
<i>All right, baby,</i>
<i>I gotta get back to set.</i>

514
00:41:13.307 --> 00:41:15.609
Okay. I miss you.

515
00:41:16.444 --> 00:41:18.112
<i>Good night, baby.</i>

516
00:41:18.212 --> 00:41:20.081
Bye.

517
00:41:34.128 --> 00:41:37.098
-Good luck, have a good day.
-Thank you.

518
00:41:37.198 --> 00:41:38.966
Now, you won't be able
to invite anyone over.

519
00:41:39.066 --> 00:41:40.701
Strangers aren't allowed
in Graceland.

520
00:41:42.502 --> 00:41:43.671
Okay.

521
00:41:54.148 --> 00:41:57.051
That's Priscilla,
the girl Elvis is seeing.

522
00:41:59.887 --> 00:42:02.289
And how does friendship
influence who we are

523
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.358
and what we become?

524
00:42:04.458 --> 00:42:06.794
- Your reports are due Friday.
- ...with Elvis Presley.

525
00:42:06.894 --> 00:42:08.696
Remember to cite examples
from the text...

526
00:42:08.796 --> 00:42:11.665
If we make friends with her
maybe we can meet him.

527
00:42:11.766 --> 00:42:14.001
And you will be graded
on penmanship

528
00:42:14.101 --> 00:42:16.270
as well as
spelling and grammar.

529
00:42:33.522 --> 00:42:35.022
Oh, honey,

530
00:42:35.122 --> 00:42:38.025
you can't be out here
making a public display
of yourself.

531
00:42:38.692 --> 00:42:40.494
Oh, I didn't think it...

532
00:42:40.594 --> 00:42:42.563
Well, you had
better start thinking.

533
00:42:49.504 --> 00:42:50.738
Come on.

534
00:43:22.369 --> 00:43:23.737
<i>How elegant!</i>

535
00:43:23.838 --> 00:43:26.774
<i>The most elegant cake</i>
<i>of all: chiffon.</i>

536
00:43:26.874 --> 00:43:28.742
<i>Now dramatically different.</i>

537
00:43:28.843 --> 00:43:31.212
<i>New and deluxe</i>
<i>vanilla cream chiffon</i>

538
00:43:31.312 --> 00:43:33.347
<i>with an exotic new taste!</i>

539
00:43:33.447 --> 00:43:37.852
<i>It's vanilla, cream</i>
<i>and a French flavor secret.</i>

540
00:43:38.452 --> 00:43:40.621
<i>Tantalizing.</i>

541
00:43:40.721 --> 00:43:42.056
<i>I said</i>
<i>to the director today,</i>

542
00:43:42.156 --> 00:43:44.291
<i>"Why'd we come all the way</i>
<i>to Los Angeles</i>

543
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:45.594
<i>"to film the Smoky Mountains?</i>

544
00:43:45.693 --> 00:43:47.094
<i>"Hell, you may know more</i>
<i>about movie makin',</i>

545
00:43:47.194 --> 00:43:49.296
<i>"but I know a thing or two</i>
<i>about the Smoky Mountains.</i>

546
00:43:49.396 --> 00:43:50.231
<i>"And I'll tell you what,</i>

547
00:43:50.331 --> 00:43:52.366
<i>"they ain't got no</i>
<i>coconut trees on 'em!"</i>

548
00:43:54.702 --> 00:43:56.370
<i>You there, baby?</i>

549
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:58.005
Mmm-hmm, I'm here.

550
00:43:58.939 --> 00:44:00.207
<i>How're you doin'?</i>

551
00:44:01.175 --> 00:44:02.743
I'm great.

552
00:44:02.843 --> 00:44:05.279
It's all been really wonderful.

553
00:44:05.379 --> 00:44:07.081
<i>That's what I like to hear.</i>

554
00:44:07.181 --> 00:44:09.350
<i>Baby, do you have</i>
<i>everything you need?</i>

555
00:44:09.683 --> 00:44:11.285
<i>How you doin' on cash?</i>

556
00:44:12.286 --> 00:44:14.388
It's funny you should ask.

557
00:44:14.488 --> 00:44:16.423
Your daddy's pretty strict.

558
00:44:17.925 --> 00:44:20.694
<i>Yeah, that's my daddy.</i>
<i>He's always been tight.</i>

559
00:44:20.794 --> 00:44:23.030
<i>That's why I have him</i>
<i>taking care of the bills.</i>

560
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:25.567
<i>I don't trust anybody else.</i>

561
00:44:25.666 --> 00:44:27.868
<i>Don't worry about it,</i>
<i>I'll talk to him.</i>

562
00:44:27.968 --> 00:44:31.138
There's a boutique that said
I could work there part-time.

563
00:44:31.238 --> 00:44:34.074
I thought I could work there
a few days a week after school.

564
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:38.312
<i>Well, you'll have to</i>
<i>forget about that.</i>

565
00:44:39.446 --> 00:44:41.015
I thought it could be fun.

566
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.085
<i>Well, it's either me</i>
<i>or a career, baby.</i>

567
00:44:45.186 --> 00:44:47.721
<i>When I call you,</i>
<i>I need you to be there for me.</i>

568
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:50.592
Mmm-hmm.

569
00:44:50.691 --> 00:44:52.693
<i>Just a few more days</i>
<i>and we'll be home.</i>

570
00:44:54.461 --> 00:44:55.763
Okay.

571
00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.300
I love you. Bye.

572
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.801
<i>Bye, baby.</i>

573
00:45:10.679 --> 00:45:13.214
Memphis, we're back, baby!

574
00:45:13.314 --> 00:45:16.116
It's good to be home!
Where's my Cilla?

575
00:45:16.217 --> 00:45:17.619
Hello.

576
00:45:17.718 --> 00:45:19.654
Hello. Hello.

577
00:45:24.626 --> 00:45:26.794
Dodger, you waited for me too.
Bless your little heart.

578
00:45:26.894 --> 00:45:28.729
I did. Welcome home, baby.

579
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:31.131
Good to see you, baby.
O-Five, what's for dinner?

580
00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.235
Cilla, come here.

581
00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:37.204
How's school?

582
00:45:37.871 --> 00:45:39.273
Oh, it's okay.

583
00:45:39.373 --> 00:45:42.109
-I don't really talk
to anybody there.
-Hmm.

584
00:45:42.209 --> 00:45:44.144
Grandma and Patsy
have been nice.

585
00:45:44.679 --> 00:45:46.280
I missed you.

586
00:45:47.414 --> 00:45:49.584
I've been trying to
find things to do with my...

587
00:45:49.684 --> 00:45:51.318
You gotta keep up
with your schoolwork

588
00:45:51.418 --> 00:45:53.387
otherwise your father
won't let you stay.

589
00:45:54.723 --> 00:45:57.391
-I know, but...
-You sure do look pretty.

590
00:45:58.325 --> 00:46:00.094
C'mon, let's have
something to eat.

591
00:46:02.997 --> 00:46:04.699
O-Five, I sure did
miss you, baby!

592
00:46:04.798 --> 00:46:06.400
Let me see you.

593
00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.768
Hand me a plate.

594
00:46:09.436 --> 00:46:11.573
I'll tell you,
that Ursula was always around.

595
00:46:11.673 --> 00:46:13.874
Oh, goddamn man,
she was a big woman.

596
00:46:13.974 --> 00:46:15.644
She was.

597
00:46:15.744 --> 00:46:18.078
-Was she pretty?
-She had a body like a man.

598
00:46:18.178 --> 00:46:19.813
No hips,
shoulders broader than mine.

599
00:46:19.913 --> 00:46:22.617
Goddamn, I was scared to
take my shirt off next to her.

600
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:25.786
But, E,
she only had eyes for you.

601
00:46:25.886 --> 00:46:27.756
No way, man,
not with that John Derek

602
00:46:27.855 --> 00:46:29.524
just lurking around
with them beady eyes.

603
00:46:32.359 --> 00:46:35.262
Probably snores like a man.

604
00:46:35.362 --> 00:46:37.898
God, I tell you, man,
I can't stand that guy.

605
00:46:37.998 --> 00:46:40.401
- What's that guy, 5'7"?
- God, five-nothing.

606
00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:42.136
Five foot-nothing.

607
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.684
Why are you taking those now?
You'll fall asleep.

608
00:46:55.784 --> 00:46:57.552
It'll take a while
for 'em to take effect.

609
00:47:08.663 --> 00:47:10.030
How's my girl?

610
00:47:12.833 --> 00:47:14.536
I'm just so happy
you're back.

611
00:47:32.587 --> 00:47:35.389
Baby, don't... Don't... Don't...
Don't get carried away.

612
00:47:37.358 --> 00:47:40.094
You gotta let me decide
when we take this moment.

613
00:47:41.763 --> 00:47:43.864
It's just this is
very sacred to me.

614
00:47:46.967 --> 00:47:49.036
What about Anita?

615
00:47:49.136 --> 00:47:50.739
You mean you didn't
make love to her

616
00:47:50.839 --> 00:47:52.239
the whole time
you were together?

617
00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:55.275
That was different.
I mean, she was older.

618
00:47:55.376 --> 00:47:57.044
That's just... That's just
the way that I feel.

619
00:47:57.144 --> 00:47:58.946
What about how I feel?

620
00:48:00.047 --> 00:48:01.982
That's asking a lot of someone.

621
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:05.319
It doesn't mean
we can't do other things.

622
00:48:17.498 --> 00:48:19.032
Hop in.
I wanna take you shopping.

623
00:48:27.074 --> 00:48:28.409
Come on. Come on.

624
00:48:40.053 --> 00:48:41.890
Well, would you
look at that, huh?

625
00:48:41.989 --> 00:48:43.558
Yeah!

626
00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.128
I think these clothes
are too sophisticated for me.

627
00:48:48.228 --> 00:48:50.998
Honey, what's sophisticated?
You could go around in a feather

628
00:48:51.098 --> 00:48:52.499
and it'll be sophisticated.

629
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.135
Yeah, that's right.

630
00:48:58.972 --> 00:49:00.608
Yeah, how many we got?

631
00:49:03.778 --> 00:49:05.814
- Oh...
- Wow!

632
00:49:05.914 --> 00:49:07.381
Oh-ho-ho.

633
00:49:07.481 --> 00:49:10.083
- We have a winner right there!
- Absolutely.

634
00:49:10.184 --> 00:49:12.720
I like you in blue, yeah.
Blue's your color.

635
00:49:22.429 --> 00:49:23.464
Oh. I like that.

636
00:49:25.567 --> 00:49:27.602
Prints take away
from your looks.

637
00:49:27.702 --> 00:49:29.169
Oh, it's like a forest.

638
00:49:29.269 --> 00:49:31.338
-I like this one.
-No, solids suit you better.

639
00:49:31.438 --> 00:49:34.408
And I hate brown.
It reminds me of the army.

640
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:45.352
All right, the car's outside.
You got his in there too, right?

641
00:49:52.226 --> 00:49:55.930
Hmm... Black hair
and more eye makeup

642
00:49:56.029 --> 00:49:58.031
will make your eyes
stand out more.

643
00:49:58.933 --> 00:50:00.334
- Mmm-hmm.
 It's 4:00, boys.

644
00:50:00.434 --> 00:50:02.069
We gotta go, barbecue's waiting.

645
00:50:02.169 --> 00:50:04.037
Come on.

646
00:50:04.137 --> 00:50:05.707
Come on, boys.

647
00:51:17.512 --> 00:51:19.681
Go, go, go!

648
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.297
Mmm...

649
00:51:53.815 --> 00:51:55.850
I can't believe
she dyed her hair!

650
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.552
Did she dye it just for him?

651
00:51:57.652 --> 00:51:58.720
Probably.

652
00:51:59.988 --> 00:52:01.221
Hello.

653
00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:04.391
What time is it?

654
00:52:05.093 --> 00:52:06.928
Almost 4:00.

655
00:52:07.028 --> 00:52:08.630
I brought breakfast for you.

656
00:52:11.264 --> 00:52:13.034
I got this for you.

657
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:17.371
Thank you!

658
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:19.741
-Right there?
-Okay.

659
00:52:20.675 --> 00:52:22.242
All right.

660
00:52:24.211 --> 00:52:25.245
Very nice.

661
00:52:25.345 --> 00:52:27.414
A natural.

662
00:52:30.752 --> 00:52:31.886

Hello.

00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:24.665
Now, what is that dress?

678
00:54:26.466 --> 00:54:28.636
Uh, that doesn't suit you, baby.

679
00:54:30.238 --> 00:54:33.541
-It doesn't?
-No, it does nothin' for you.

680
00:54:33.641 --> 00:54:36.811
Takes away from your eyes
and from your face.

681
00:54:36.911 --> 00:54:39.113
Oh, man, it does nothing
for your figure. All you see

682
00:54:39.213 --> 00:54:40.848
-is a goddamn dress.
-You finished?

683
00:54:40.948 --> 00:54:42.517
Satnin, you're a small girl.

684
00:54:42.617 --> 00:54:44.752
You gotta keep away
from the prints, baby!

685
00:54:44.852 --> 00:54:47.121
Okay, I'll return
the fucking dress!

686
00:54:56.531 --> 00:54:58.733
Priscilla, final exams
are coming up.

687
00:54:58.833 --> 00:55:00.535
You will need to
keep your grades up

688
00:55:00.635 --> 00:55:02.703
in order to graduate
with your class.

689
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:05.072
Yes, Sister Adrian.

690
00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:13.313
Dad, I'm doing great.
You don't have to...

691

Yes, of course
I'm doing well in school.

00:55:17.819 --> 00:55:19.821
<i>Uh-huh. Do you know</i>
<i>we want you to graduate?</i>

694
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:23.591
Yes, I will graduate.
Don't worry.

695
00:55:23.691 --> 00:55:25.458
<i>Your mother and I</i>

01:25:32.499 --> 01:25:34.535
put on one of yours
or something good?

1038
01:25:34.636 --> 01:25:37.437
Boy, I swear to God,
I'll shoot you in the foot.

1039
01:25:37.538 --> 01:25:38.940
I'm not...

1040
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.942
G-7. G-7, you gotta pick it.

1041
01:25:41.042 --> 01:25:43.176
G-7. What's a "beatle"?

1042
01:25:43.276 --> 01:25:46.614
You're a goddamn beetle,
I tell you, crawling around.

1043
01:25:46.714 --> 01:25:47.815
You little freak.

1044
01:25:47.915 --> 01:25:50.852
I wanna play J-8.
You're a Patsy Cline guy, no?

1045
01:25:50.952 --> 01:25:52.854
Don't tell me to play
goddamn Beatles in my house.

1046
01:25:52.954 --> 01:25:54.822
We're in America,
I swear to God.

1047
01:25:54.922 --> 01:25:56.858
Fantastic.

1048
01:25:56.958 --> 01:25:58.358
Thank you.

1049
01:26:01.261 --> 01:26:02.797
All right!

1050
01:26:24.585 --> 01:26:27.021
Not enough zippers.

1051
01:26:27.121 --> 01:26:28.690
We can get more...

1052
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:31.092
You could put a parachute
around the back.

1053
01:26:34.327 --> 01:26:35.897
How'd it go?

1054
01:26:39.967 --> 01:26:42.335
Well?

1055
01:26:44.972 --> 01:26:48.810
I... I...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna be a daddy?

1056
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:50.410
Mmm-hmm.

1057
01:26:52.312 --> 01:26:54.281
Get Vernon on the phone,
you tell him he's gonna be

1058
01:26:54.381 --> 01:26:55.917
a grey-headed granddaddy.

1059
01:26:57.685 --> 01:26:59.987
Sir, can you make
a little tiny one now?

1060
01:27:02.857 --> 01:27:05.325
Oh, what is it, Satnin?

1061
01:27:05.425 --> 01:27:07.294
What happened
to that twinkle in your eyes?

1062
01:27:08.096 --> 01:27:09.463
I'm scared.

1063
01:27:09.564 --> 01:27:12.567
Whatever you wanna do,
I'll back you up.

1064
01:27:12.667 --> 01:27:16.303
I want a baby.
It's just so soon.

1065
01:27:18.806 --> 01:27:23.511
What about our trip to Europe
and all of our plans together?

1066
01:27:23.611 --> 01:27:25.479
It's all right.
We'll go another time.

1067
01:27:26.981 --> 01:27:28.616
Come here.

1068
01:27:28.716 --> 01:27:30.250
Okay.

1069
01:27:32.186 --> 01:27:33.755
We're having a little one.

1070
01:28:34.582 --> 01:28:36.818
- Cilla!
- Yes?

1071
01:28:36.918 --> 01:28:38.451
Cilla, come here.

1072
01:28:45.693 --> 01:28:47.061
Yes?

1073
01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:49.564
Cilla, I've been thinking...

1074
01:28:50.865 --> 01:28:55.368
You know, I have to have
time to think and...

1075
01:28:55.468 --> 01:28:58.539
Things just haven't been right,
you know, and I...

1076
01:28:59.574 --> 01:29:01.676
I think it'd be best
for the two of us

1077
01:29:01.776 --> 01:29:03.878
if we took a little time apart.

1078
01:29:07.347 --> 01:29:08.950
What are you talking about?

1079
01:29:13.453 --> 01:29:15.923
-What did I do?
-Oh, baby, you don't see...

1080
01:29:16.023 --> 01:29:20.360
Well, you didn't do anything.
It's not you. It's just that...

1081
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:23.496
I've been going through
some things and I just...

1082
01:29:26.033 --> 01:29:28.468
I just think it'd be best
if we took a little break.

1083
01:29:33.307 --> 01:29:34.876
You've got it.

1084
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:37.612
Just tell me when to leave.

1085
01:29:48.289 --> 01:29:49.724
Oh, wait, baby!

1086
01:29:49.824 --> 01:29:51.859
I don't mean it, Cilla.
Don't leave.

1087
01:29:53.561 --> 01:29:55.763
- Go, go!
- Come on, come on!

1088
01:29:55.863 --> 01:29:57.865
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

1089
01:30:25.927 --> 01:30:27.728
Elvis?

1090
01:30:28.930 --> 01:30:30.497
Elvis?

1091
01:30:31.365 --> 01:30:34.869
Hey, wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

1092
01:30:34.969 --> 01:30:36.503
Huh?

1093
01:30:37.004 --> 01:30:38.839
Baby's coming.

1094
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.675
Oh.

1095
01:30:40.908 --> 01:30:42.944
Are you sure?

1096
01:30:43.044 --> 01:30:44.512
-Yes.
-Oh...

1097
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.883
Oh...

1098
01:30:50.184 --> 01:30:53.921
Daddy, it's time.
You need to send a car up, okay?

1099
01:30:55.656 --> 01:30:58.826
Oh.

1100
01:30:58.926 --> 01:31:00.361
Joe! Jerry!

1101
01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:01.829
Who put this
fuckin' table there?

1102
01:31:01.929 --> 01:31:03.631
Jerry! Jerry, it's time
to send the car up!

1103
01:31:03.731 --> 01:31:05.266
Cilla's having the baby!

1104
01:31:05.366 --> 01:31:06.934
We're on it!
We're going!

1105
01:31:07.034 --> 01:31:10.171
Where's my daddy?

1106
01:31:13.674 --> 01:31:16.143
Do you want to
call the Colonel?

1107
01:31:42.636 --> 01:31:44.372
You okay, sweetheart?

1108
01:31:44.472 --> 01:31:46.073
Mmm-hmm.
- I'll get her.

1109
01:31:46.173 --> 01:31:47.508
Yeah.

1110
01:31:50.978 --> 01:31:52.213
Oh.

1111
01:32:01.655 --> 01:32:03.991
We got ourselves
a baby girl, Satnin.

1112
01:32:05.626 --> 01:32:07.261
We sure do.

1113
01:32:13.601 --> 01:32:15.469
Oh. Oh.

1114
01:32:21.142 --> 01:32:23.310
Give us space, guys,
give us space.

1115
01:33:24.839 --> 01:33:27.374
Elvis, it's been so long...

1116
01:33:29.643 --> 01:33:31.745
I know, I just don't
wanna hurt you, baby.

1117
01:33:32.313 --> 01:33:33.914
Well, I'm okay.

1118
01:33:36.518 --> 01:33:38.085
Let's just wait a little.

1119
01:33:55.402 --> 01:33:58.305
Hi, sweetie.

1120
01:33:59.807 --> 01:34:01.709
-She's ready for her nap.
-Okay.

1121
01:34:03.377 --> 01:34:04.979
Sweet dreams.

1122
01:34:14.255 --> 01:34:15.890
Satnin, I don't know.

1123
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:18.359
I feel a little silly
in this outfit.

1124
01:34:18.593 --> 01:34:20.127

1125
01:34:21.495 --> 01:34:23.063

Nice.

01:40:23.725 --> 01:40:25.259
One.

1209
01:40:26.059 --> 01:40:27.629
Two.

1210
01:40:28.663 --> 01:40:30.264
Three.

1211
01:40:30.364 --> 01:40:31.799
Four.

1212
01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:33.635
Five.

1213
01:40:33.735 --> 01:40:35.402
Six.

1214
01:40:35.502 --> 01:40:37.037
Seven, eight.

1215
01:40:38.105 --> 01:40:39.908
Up a bit higher.
Up here, all right?

1216
01:40:40.008 --> 01:40:42.075
A good strong angle
for your arm, okay?

1217
01:40:42.710 --> 01:40:44.311
Good boy.

1218
01:40:47.949 --> 01:40:50.785
What was it? The third <i>ka</i> ...
What was it called?

1219
01:40:50.885 --> 01:40:52.386
<i>-Heian Yondan.</i>
<i>-Heian Yondan.</i>

1220
01:40:52.486 --> 01:40:54.288
-The fourth <i>kata.</i>
-The fourth <i>kata.</i>

1221
01:40:54.388 --> 01:40:57.124
-Fourth. Close.
-And I, um...

1222
01:40:57.224 --> 01:40:58.593
I guess I'm getting
a little too good

1223
01:40:58.693 --> 01:41:01.629
and I punched him
straight in the nose.

1224
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:04.164
My memory's a little blurry
because, um...

1225
01:41:04.264 --> 01:41:07.434
You might've shaken something
a bit loose, but... No.

1226
01:41:07.535 --> 01:41:09.971
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. It's fine.

1227
01:42:46.801 --> 01:42:48.402
Mommy!

1228
01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:54.108
It broke.

1229
01:42:54.207 --> 01:42:55.810
I can't believe it.

1230
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:57.145
Excuse me, Mrs. Presley.

1231
01:42:57.244 --> 01:42:59.547
Elvis asked that you meet him
in the suite.

1232
01:42:59.647 --> 01:43:01.181
Okay, thank you.

1233
01:43:02.517 --> 01:43:05.520
He never goes to his room
between shows.

1234
01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:08.221
Um, I'm gonna go see what's up
and I'll meet you guys after.

1235
01:43:08.321 --> 01:43:09.924
-Okay.
-Okay, see you then.

1236
01:43:10.024 --> 01:43:11.726
And then what happened?

1237
01:43:11.826 --> 01:43:13.561
Everything smashed.

1238
01:43:29.110 --> 01:43:30.712
Hello?

1239
01:43:34.849 --> 01:43:36.416
Hey.

1240
01:43:38.953 --> 01:43:40.588
Hey, is everything okay?

1241
01:43:42.056 --> 01:43:43.624
Cilla.

1242
01:43:51.532 --> 01:43:53.400
Shh. I wanna show you
how a real man

1243
01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.036
makes love to his woman.

1244
01:43:55.136 --> 01:43:57.138
Oh! What are you doing? Oh!

1245
01:43:57.237 --> 01:43:59.372
Please, stop! Just stop!

1246
01:44:00.007 --> 01:44:01.542
Stop.

1247
01:44:36.711 --> 01:44:37.645
I'm leaving.

1248
01:44:40.347 --> 01:44:41.949
What do you mean, "leaving"?

1249
01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.688
I'm leaving our marriage.

1250
01:44:52.593 --> 01:44:54.394
Are you out of your mind?

1251
01:44:55.897 --> 01:44:58.498
You have everything
a woman could want.

1252
01:45:00.367 --> 01:45:02.737
You don't mean that, Satnin.
You can't.

1253
01:45:04.539 --> 01:45:06.908
You mean I've been so blind
I didn't see this coming?

1254
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:10.011
We're living separate lives.

1255
01:45:14.347 --> 01:45:16.717
Have I lost you to another man?

1256
01:45:18.719 --> 01:45:21.088
You're losing me
to a life of my own.

1257
01:45:30.231 --> 01:45:32.465
I have to go.

1258
01:45:36.103 --> 01:45:37.939
If I stay, I'll never leave.

1259
01:45:41.441 --> 01:45:44.011
Maybe another place,
another time.

1260
01:47:03.658 --> 01:47:05.425
Kiss Lisa for me.

1261
01:47:07.228 --> 01:47:08.796
Bless you.
