00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Excuse me.

2
00:01:11.432 --> 00:01:12.226
 Sorry.

3
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.393
 Excuse me.

4
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Sorry.

5
00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:34.468
 Hi. Where's your bathroom?

6
00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.000
 It's for customers only.

7
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Oh, okay. I'll buy something.

8
00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:41.000
 You gotta pay up there.

9
00:01:44.407 --> 00:01:46.822
 Can I just go now? I really have to pee.

10
00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:49.000
 I've got a large cappuccino for Skylar.

11
00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:50.251
 Thanks.

12
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.255
I also kind of, well, no...

13
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.019
I know that establishments
that serve food or drink must

14
00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.975
be open to the public regardless
of their purchasing class.

15
00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:03.000
 Sorry, it's our policy.

16
00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:06.190
 Store policy can't really supersede state law.

17
00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:08.441
 Please, it's an emergency.

18
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.466
 Caramel latte for Miranda.

19
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.372
 Honey, I'm about to order. Do you want your usual?

20
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.000
 Uh.

21
00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:21.377
My wife would like a
double espresso

22
00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:23.388
although you've had trouble
sleeping lately, right babe?

23
00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:25.908
Maybe we should back
it off to a single.

24
00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:28.675
You kept the light on until
like midnight last night.

25
00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:31.455
 I did, didn't I?

26
00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:35.750
 Yeah, so maybe I'll just have a peppermint tea with two sugars.

27
00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:38.012
 Thanks, husband.

28
00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:43.000
 Oh, and the bread. It's grilled cheese night.

29
00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:47.000
 And she is part of the purchasing class, so can we get the bathroom key?

30
00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:50.898
 Thank you.

31
00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:59.000
 Thank you. That was really nice.

32
00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:00.518
 Happy to.

33
00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:04.000
 You knew a lot about bathroom law.

34
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 It was a short chapter.

35
00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:09.000
 Thank you.

36
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Oh.

37
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.000
 I'll have your tea waiting for you.

38
00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:17.000
 Can't leave my wife.

39
00:03:18.413 --> 00:03:19.000
 Oh.

40
00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:27.000
 Okay. That's great. I will see you on the other side.

41
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Hallie, I just met this guy and I don't know, it was something.

42
00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:56.000
 Well, I know it's been a while, but I'm pretty sure he bought me a tea and he might have just stolen my coat.

43
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 But what do I do?

44
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.278
 Oh no, this is the time that I'm supposed to be meeting people and doing things.

45
00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.000
 Hallie, I gotta call you back.

46
00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:10.108
 God damn it.

47
00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:36.196
 Are you okay?

48
00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:41.000
 Big time. I am big time okay.

49
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.895
 I just had to pee for like the last six hours and I just started this new internship.

50
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:54.469
 And I didn't want to ask anyone where the bathroom was because I didn't want them to think I was weak and not a problem solver.

51
00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:57.000
 Okay.

52
00:04:57.607 --> 00:05:03.924
 And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. Every human does it. It's very, very normal.

53
00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:05.000
 Yeah.

54
00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:20.447
 Peppermint tea, two sugars.

55
00:05:21.114 --> 00:05:25.672
 Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.

56
00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:28.332
 Oh.

57
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Hi.

58
00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:41.000
 Thank you.

59
00:05:43.463 --> 00:05:44.292
 Oh, hey.

60
00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:47.000
 You...

61
00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:49.000
 So are you going to ask me out now?

62
00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:53.270
 Yeah. Yeah, I am.

63
00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.782
 I'm Ben.

64
00:05:58.807 --> 00:06:00.000
 I'm Bea.

65
00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:19.000
 So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, you would not be able to protect us?

66
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 No, no. You'd be dead.

67
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.687
 You would let me die?

68
00:06:22.712 --> 00:06:25.747
 I'm not going to let you die. I'm just going to survive.

69
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.000
 You're right. You're right. You're right.

70
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.628
 I was a gymnast.

71
00:06:32.914 --> 00:06:33.914
 Gymnast?

72
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:38.285
 Yes. For like five years. I got like sixth place on beam.

73
00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:39.000
 Sixth place?

74
00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:41.209
 Yes. Got a ribbon.

75
00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:42.250
 I'm impressed.

76
00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:43.684
 Everybody gets a ribbon.

77
00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:54.000
 All right, wait to cool down. You just saw me take it off the burning stove.

78
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Oh, my God.

79
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.911
If you're going to be a lawyer,
you got to understand negligence

80
00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:02.377
and breach and McDonald's
versus that lady's habeas corpus.

81
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.373
 You used none of those terms properly.

82
00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:06.217
How do you know?
You're not a lawyer yet.

83
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:08.327
It's not too late to choose
a more noble profession.

84
00:07:08.352 --> 00:07:09.516
 Oh, like you?

85
00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:13.362
 You're right. Stick with it. I'm going to need a lawyer at some point.

86
00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:16.000
 I don't even know if I want to be a lawyer.

87
00:07:17.657 --> 00:07:20.098
 I cannot believe I just said that out loud.

88
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:26.855
 I'm sorry. My life is a disaster right now.

89
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.434
 Might be turning the corner. You just met me.

90
00:07:31.377 --> 00:07:33.000
 Or I might end up in a suitcase.

91
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.174
I mean, look at this place.

92
00:07:35.198 --> 00:07:37.755
It looks like every serial killer
reenactment documentary.

93
00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:39.232
 Why do you have a giant wrench?

94
00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:44.000
 Okay, it wouldn't be a suitcase. It'd be a carry-on because you're zero feet tall.

95
00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:50.174
 And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how broken something is, there's always a way to fix it.

96
00:07:51.377 --> 00:07:54.114
 I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm talking to you about my mom right now.

97
00:07:54.838 --> 00:07:57.000
 Alright. Then tell me about that.

98
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.227
 That is a long story. Everybody survived.

99
00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:04.000
 Great.

100
00:09:14.917 --> 00:09:18.009
 Holly, I don't know this guy. He's fucking great.

101
00:09:31.878 --> 00:09:34.863
 Yo, let's go, Benny. Come on, cupcake. We're gonna be late.

102
00:09:34.962 --> 00:09:35.962
 'Sup, Pete.

103
00:09:36.882 --> 00:09:38.578
 No way. You cooked?

104
00:09:39.502 --> 00:09:41.470
 That girl you blew me off for stayed over?

105
00:09:42.298 --> 00:09:47.748
 He asked me out and then I kind of asked him out and then we just walked around the city and we fell asleep talking.

106
00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:50.369
 I don't-- I left before you could wake up.

107
00:09:51.417 --> 00:09:54.000
 I don't know why. Why did I?

108
00:09:55.142 --> 00:09:56.208
 What the fuck am I doing?

109
00:09:56.808 --> 00:09:59.953
 Okay, I love you. Bye. I'm so sorry I woke you up. I didn't--

110
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 This whole thing is so new to me.

111
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Bye.

112
00:10:04.058 --> 00:10:06.080
 You got cheese and bread.

113
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.040
 You didn't miss one ingredient.

114
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.424
 What you doing with that?

115
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.069
 Why you got the giant wrench?

116
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.698
 You told her about your mom, bro?

117
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.031
 You don't tell nobody about your mom.

118
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.400
 Fuck, dog.

119
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.082
 You in love, man.

120
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.600
 About fucking time, man.

121
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.952
 My boy's in love.

122
00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:25.920
 Fuck that.

123
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.000
 I couldn't get her out of here fast enough.

124
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.120
 This girl's a disaster.

125
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.080
 She's a nothing.

126
00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:47.640
 Want to get a mansion, a jacuzzi, a theater

127
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:51.000
 to watch my movies, a couple whips and lots of fancy things.

128
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.800
 The kids, they call the goonies.

129
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.560
 I see the future crystal ball, mirror, mirror,

130
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.480
 hanging on the wall.

131
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.440
 Got your girlfriend screaming all the cops.

132
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.640
 Hey.

133
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.440
 Hey.

134
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.240
 Claudia.

135
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.040
 Holly.

136
00:11:12.134 --> 00:11:13.093
 There we go.

137
00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:17.500
 Hey, what's up, Glee?

138
00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:22.176
 Ben, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.

139
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.440
 Are we saying that now?

140
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.720
 Yeah, is that cool?

141
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.280
 Yeah, I mean, I don't really like labels,

142
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.200
 but I like you a whole bunch.

143
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.520
 I like your friend a whole bunch.

144
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.040
 And if she wants to put a label on me,

145
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.240
 then she can sew it on wherever she wants.

146
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.040
 That was weird.

147
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.840
 That was weird.

148
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.640
 I'm not into S&M or anything like that,

149
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.840
 unless you are, which would be totally cool, you know?

150
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.080
 You do you.

151
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.726
 Well, she really likes you, too.

152
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.080
 And that is very rare for her.

153
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.778
 Oh, look who's talking.

154
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.760
 How's the crowd in here tonight?

155
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.680
 Over there, big boy.

156
00:11:54.585 --> 00:11:55.440
 Oh, B.

157
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.600
 Ladies like dumplings?

158
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.920
 We just had the greatest dumplings.

159
00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.080
 Pete, meet my sister.

160
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.000
 This is Pete, Claudia's brother.

161
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.800
 Nice to meet you.

162
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.400
 And Ben.

163
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.400
 Ben.

164
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.320
 This is Ben.

165
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.400
 We all grew up together.

166
00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:11.440
 Hey.

167
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.280
 Yeah.

168
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.368
 You two know each other?

169
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.720
 Yeah, we met.

170
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720
 Barely.

171
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.360
 Wow, that's so random.

172
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.880
 I'm going to go grab a drink.

173
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.000
 Door's that way if you're looking to sneak out.

174
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.440
 I know that's your thing.

175
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.360
 Well, I am a disaster.

176
00:12:27.609 --> 00:12:30.360
 Let's go away from this.

177
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.720
 Yeah.

178
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.960
 So you a lawyer yet?

179
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.880
 Why?

180
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.400
 Do you need a defense attorney?

181
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.720
 I'm just curious how you passed the class on ethics

182
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.800
 and not bailing on people.

183
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.160
 I think that's the jerk who B got with when she was

184
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.360
 on her break from Jonathan.

185
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.760
 No way.

186
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.320
 So B's the coffee girl who ghosted him?

187
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.280
 I thought she looked familiar, but I don't see faces.

188
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.280
 I just see souls.

189
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.560
 At least he made her realize that Jonathan was the one.

190
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.480
 I'm engaged now.

191
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.320
 Good for you.

192
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.000
 Where are you registered?

193
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.960
 I'll buy you a broomstick.

194
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.480
 I'll send you an invite.

195
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.600
 You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?

196
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.680
 You do remember.

197
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.160
 See, it did mean something to you.

198
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.200
 You'll always be my rock bottom.

199
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.280
 The night I spent with a bitch.

200
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.960
 Did she just call him a bitch?

201
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.760
 You think they're going to physically fight?

202
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.520
 Or fuck?

203
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.000
 That's a fine line.

204
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.040
 Let's just get through tonight for them, OK?

205
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.120
 Elle, she's your sister.

206
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.880
 I'm sure the relationship won't last long.

207
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.000
 She's your friend.

208
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.800
 I question why they're even together.

209
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.760
 Then I'm going to get a drink and toast to never

210
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.120
 seeing you again.

211
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.760
 Cheers to that, bro.

212
00:13:25.612 --> 00:13:28.593
ANYONE BUT YOU

213
00:13:29.648 --> 00:13:31.880
 So before I pronounce this newlywed couple,

214
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.720
 if anyone has an issue with these two wonderful people

215
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.040
 joining together in holy matrimony,

216
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.380
 speak now or forever hold your peace.

217
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.880
 I have an objection.

218
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.000
 Leo, don't do this.

219
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.880
 I have to, Annie.

220
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.400
 It's just not right.

221
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.667
 There's no way I can bless this union

222
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.000
 without their friends and family joining us

223
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.960
 to celebrate in Australia.

224
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.376
 We're getting married in Sydney.

225
00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:08.160
 Welcome on board.

226
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.160
 2K to the front.

227
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.480
 Thank you, Sheryl.

228
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.560
 51E, how long's the flight?

229
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.400
 16 hours.

230
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.146
 51F, thanks.

231
00:14:19.696 --> 00:14:21.640
 73F, all the way to the back.

232
00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:43.748
 Hey.

233
00:14:44.715 --> 00:14:46.107
 Head of the wedding?

234
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.840
 Of my sister, yes, I am.

235
00:14:49.874 --> 00:14:51.880
 How crazy is it that we're on the same plane?

236
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.160
 Don't think there's thousands of flights

237
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.280
 flying to Sydney every day.

238
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.480
 Oh, there's quite a few, actually.

239
00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:00.640
 Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, some co-chairs.

240
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.880
 Serendipity, I guess.

241
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.000
 I don't think that word means what you think it means.

242
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 So where's your fiance?

243
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.880
 Wait, is this him?

244
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.760
 Hey, I'm Ben.

245
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.720
 I was her hall pass on your break.

246
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.600
 What?

247
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.920
 Oh my god, I forgot.

248
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.040
 Claude told me you dumped him.

249
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.960
 Did you sneak out on your wedding day?

250
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.680
 Wow, you are a child.

251
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.480
 It's a pretty long flight.

252
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.520
 Do you want anything from the front of the boat?

253
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.200
 Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, last 10 years of your life?

254
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.320
 No, thank you.

255
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.400
 I'm all good on creatine and smell like insecurity.

256
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.593
 Nothing small about me.

257
00:15:30.151 --> 00:15:31.535
 What the fuck?

258
00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:33.622
 Have a good flight.

259
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.680
 See you there.

260
00:15:39.551 --> 00:15:42.200
 Why do so many of us feel stuck?

261
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.320
 How is it even a very successful?

262
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.680
 Often feel like there is something

263
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.760
 missing from their lives.

264
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.080
 Why do so many people spend years

265
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.080
 mystically thinking about choices they might have made?

266
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.760
 One answer to that problem, many of us

267
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.560
 are leading lives that are misaligned

268
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.210
 with our own deepest values and preferences.

269
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.480
 Thank you so much for joining me today on Hidden Brain.

270
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.720
 What psychology can teach us about living

271
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.240
 our most authentic lives?

272
00:17:43.109 --> 00:17:44.196
 What the fuck?

273
00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.160
 Hey, Vinny!

274
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.839
 Vindale!

275
00:17:57.455 --> 00:17:59.634
 OK, Vin, looking good.

276
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.680
 Thanks for picking me up, dude.

277
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.160
 Not just you, my guy.

278
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.160
 Spelling Bee!

279
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160
 Hey!

280
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.680
 Our sisters are getting married.

281
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.680
 How dope is that?

282
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680
 I know, I'm so excited.

283
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680
 Oh, great.

284
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.160
 All right, let's hit it.

285
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.160
 Bye.

286
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160
 Y'all ready for Australia?

287
00:18:27.438 --> 00:18:29.160
 Can't wait for y'all to see where we stay.

288
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.580
 And the plan is so dope.

289
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.160
 We're all staying at the same place?

290
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.160
 Yep, my stepdad's house.

291
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
 Super important for them to keep the wedding party together.

292
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.160
 Sounds like a piece of information that could have been shared a little earlier.

293
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
 Well, that's because they think you guys hate each other,

294
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.584
 so they didn't want to poke the beard.

295
00:19:12.185 --> 00:19:13.160
 Not bad, right?

296
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.160
 You don't even play tennis.

297
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.160
 I know, but I feel sweet.

298
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.160
 Hey, meet Kalonabee, y'all.

299
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.160
 Meet Kalonabee.

300
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.160
 Hey, meet Kalonabee.

301
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.160
 All over.

302
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.160
 All over.

303
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.160
 Spin, spin, spin.

304
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160
 Woo-hoo!

305
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.160
 He was the only member of the family who was trans.

306
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.160
 Yeah, he was there.

307
00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:40.842
 Whoa.

308
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160
 You're right.

309
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.160
 This place is insane.

310
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.685
 I know.

311
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.160
 All right, let's get some sand under your feet.

312
00:19:53.348 --> 00:19:54.343
 Have you guys made up?

313
00:19:54.913 --> 00:19:55.344
 All good.

314
00:19:55.369 --> 00:19:57.160
 We're fine if he just stays away from me.

315
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160
 Don't need an invitation for that.

316
00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.936
 I think you do if you're like this.

317
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.960
 You can't leave me alone.

318
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.240
 - Same reason I slowed down at the car crash.

319
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.160
 - Okay, so you guys buried the hatchet,

320
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.240
 water under the bridge, two adults adulting

321
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.500
 like fucking adults.

322
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500
 - Oh, we did have a little bit

323
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.120
 of a last minute snafu though.

324
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.200
 You guys are gonna have to share a room.

325
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.220
 There's only one bed,

326
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.920
 but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.

327
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.260
 - She's kidding.

328
00:20:18.288 --> 00:20:19.530
 - You're funny.

329
00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:20.979
 I can't wait any longer.

330
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.200
 - Wait for me!

331
00:20:24.517 --> 00:20:27.300
 - Hallie's such a goof.

332
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.600
 - She's good for you.

333
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.100
 She could use some spontaneity.

334
00:20:31.884 --> 00:20:35.673
 Hey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.

335
00:20:35.698 --> 00:20:36.738
 - I hope so.

336
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.120
 I have a million contingencies

337
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.160
 and scenarios for everything.

338
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.800
 And honestly, I just want this wedding to be beautiful

339
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.360
 because I love the shit out of her

340
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.800
 and I just wanna marry the bitch, you know what I'm saying?

341
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.349
 - You're such a romantic.

342
00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:53.400
 - Hey, don't be mad at me, but Margaret's here.

343
00:20:54.891 --> 00:20:56.016
 - Why would I be mad?

344
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.200
 She lives here, I was 100% expecting to see her.

345
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.360
 - Yeah.

346
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.680
 Margaret, Margaret, look who's here.

347
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.840
 - There she is.

348
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.385
 100%.

349
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.220
 - Go rip off the band-aid.

350
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.440
 - Babe!

351
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.480
 - How's it going, stranger?

352
00:21:20.826 --> 00:21:22.480
 - I was hoping you'd come.

353
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.320
 I wanted to message you,

354
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.520
 but I didn't know how you'd feel about hearing from me.

355
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.420
 - Are you kidding?

356
00:21:29.099 --> 00:21:31.280
 - I'm never leaving.

357
00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.360
 Never leave.

358
00:21:34.348 --> 00:21:35.840
 How are mom and dad?

359
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.760
 - They're good.

360
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.760
 You know, mom now thinks she's Australian

361
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.240
 and dad's not at all pointing out

362
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.400
 every tiny little detail that's different.

363
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:44.480
 - They're also a little worried

364
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.200
 how you're gonna react to all this.

365
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.560
 - What are you talking about?

366
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.520
 - Well, you know, everybody thought

367
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.280
 that you'd be the one getting married first.

368
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.880
 You always used to talk about your wedding growing up.

369
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.560
 You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress

370
00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.440
 when I just used it to dress like a mummy, you know?

371
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.800
 - Hallie, stop.

372
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.160
 That's not me anymore.

373
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.320
 I'm free now.

374
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.600
 I'm deprogrammed.

375
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.160
 That does not mean I don't support you

376
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.761
 and your misguided view that soulmates exist.

377
00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.280
 - That's sweet.

378
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.600
 Is that gonna be your toast?

379
00:22:10.557 --> 00:22:12.600
 - You and Claudia are the exception.

380
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.400
 I'm really happy for you, for real.

381
00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:21.960
 - What's going on over there?

382
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.200
 - That's Claudia's cousin.

383
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.072
 She visited the States a few years back.

384
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.320
 They dated.

385
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.160
 - No biggie.

386
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.000
 - Broke up with him.

387
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.840
 - Crushed his heart.

388
00:22:29.652 --> 00:22:31.800
 - No way, that man does not have a heart.

389
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.404
 - Feels like forever ago.

390
00:22:35.429 --> 00:22:36.909
 We were babies.

391
00:22:36.934 --> 00:22:38.534
 - I'm really happy you're here.

392
00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:41.871
 We can reconnect as maybe not babies.

393
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:43.278
 - I would love that.

394
00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:46.720
 Beau!

395
00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:48.760
 Come eat my mate.

396
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.880
 Ben, this is my partner, Beau.

397
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.720
 - Hi, mate.

398
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.480
 - Like, tennis partner?

399
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.320
 - Sometimes after.

400
00:22:58.605 --> 00:23:00.200
 How do you two dags know each other?

401
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.149
 - We had a bit of a go back when, didn't we?

402
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.960
 - Did you now?

403
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.917
 Good on ya.

404
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.360
 Hey, we're gonna go trotting this weekend.

405
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.680
 Hit up the turps out here, eh?

406
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.840
 It's gonna be a cracker.

407
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840
 - Woo!

408
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.216
 - You know it.

409
00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:14.000
 - Great guy.

410
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.840
 - Yeah.

411
00:23:38.892 --> 00:23:39.617
 - Mommy!

412
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.040
 - Hey, Beatrice.

413
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.400
 - Dad! - You made it.

414
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.320
 - Oh, baby.

415
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.160
 - Hi, baby.

416
00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.600
 - Hi, honey.

417
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.520
 Oh, my God.

418
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.601
 - Wow.

419
00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:51.440
 - How's our future lawyer?

420
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.280
 - Great.

421
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.200
 - Great.

422
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.040
 - How's the trip been?

423
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.600
 - Oh, magical.

424
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.960
 The Australians are all wonderful.

425
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.440
 And excuse me, but good looking.

426
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:01.884
 - Oh.

427
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:03.480
 - Why are they so weird about their plugs?

428
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.640
 I mean, this place is basically America.

429
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.920
 They speak English, they eat regular food,

430
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.560
 they have a complicated relationship with their past.

431
00:24:11.358 --> 00:24:12.920
 - How are you doing, honey?

432
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.765
 - I'm doing okay.

433
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.040
 - I'm doing great.

434
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.907
 My big sister's getting married.

435
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.560
 Could have been you.

436
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.920
 Could still be you someday.

437
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.040
 - Have you heard from Jonathan?

438
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.880
 Did he call or anything?

439
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.000
 - Well, that didn't take long.

440
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.480
 - We're just torn up that he's not part

441
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.560
 of our family anymore.

442
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.600
 - I mean, he works at our house every night

443
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.240
 from like 11 years old.

444
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.760
 He was basically family.

445
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.560
 Was about to be actual family.

446
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.920
 If I never ask you for anything ever again,

447
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.714
 can you please just lay off of me this weekend?

448
00:24:43.139 --> 00:24:45.680
 - I just want both of our daughters to be happy.

449
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.120
 - I'm very happy, but not when you guys do this.

450
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.320
 - Ned, you in the right direction?

451
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.160
 - He's such a great guy.

452
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.600
 - Just think on it, yeah?

453
00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:05.466
 - Bee, dinner at 7.30, okay?

454
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.520
 - Yeah.

455
00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:08.400
 Yeah.

456
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.680
 - Ben, all set for dinner, yeah?

457
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.800
 - Yeah, I'll be there.

458
00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:57.280
 - I was plagiarizing.

459
00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.120
 - Hey!

460
00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.960
 - Hi Ben!

461
00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.800
 - Hey Ben!

462
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.640
 - Hey, hey, hey.

463
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.480
 - Hey, hey, hey.

464
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.320
 - Everybody?

465
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.200
 - Dad's speech.

466
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.040
 - Oh yes, right, okay.

467
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.440
 - We're gonna make this short,

468
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.880
 because you've all traveled a bloody long distance,

469
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.120
 and Carol and I are so appreciative.

470
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.000
 Biggest thing we've missed since coming back

471
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.320
 from the States is not seeing our kids.

472
00:26:16.824 --> 00:26:18.916
 And you lot, our extended family,

473
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.160
 so we're just over the moon to have a full house

474
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.760
 before the wedding on Sunday.

475
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.072
 - Where we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia,

476
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.142
 setting off on this crazy thing called life.

477
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.680
 And of course, Innie and Leo, our new family.

478
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.600
 - Well, we're just so grateful,

479
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.080
 not only for your incredible hospitality,

480
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.080
 but for bringing into the world your beautiful daughter.

481
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.294
 - So as they say in our country, abondanza.

482
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.226
 - Cheers!

483
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.740
 - Now baby.

484
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.398
 - Wow!

485
00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:15.600
 - What classes are you loving?

486
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.912
 Have you given any more thought to tort law?

487
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.600
 'Cause class action is really where it's at right now.

488
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.520
 What does Jonathan say?

489
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.360
 He knows you pretty well.

490
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.600
 What does he think you should do?

491
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.440
 - Mom.

492
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.280
 - Okay.

493
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.000
 - I can't even remember why we put you in the truck again.

494
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.040
 - We didn't put her in the trunk,

495
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.200
 she stowed away in the trunk.

496
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.360
 - Yeah, I wanted to go with you guys to see Cinderella.

497
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.760
 - We were going to Coachella.

498
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.960
 - I know that now, it was nice.

499
00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.520
 - All right, everyone.

500
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.426
 So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy.

501
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.920
 Let's just have a moment to calm ourselves.

502
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.680
 I am not looking at anybody in particular,

503
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.680
 but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.

504
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.280
 Crown chakra.

505
00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:56.301
 Let's hit that cobra.

506
00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.240
 Cleanse, get that weasel.

507
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.080
 - Okay.

508
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.920
 - Go!

509
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.034
 - You go, you go.

510
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.000
 - Sign of the times.

511
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.920
 - All right, all right, four words.

512
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.240
 - First word, the, A, of, if.

513
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.280
 - Animosity, hate, liar.

514
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.120
 Five words.

515
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.080
 - No, just shut the fuck up.

516
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.280
 - The Bible.

517
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.080
 - A woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality

518
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.000
 to take advantage of other people.

519
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.320
 - Mom, focus, okay?

520
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.160
 Right here, right here.

521
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.320
 - This is a white people's game.

522
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.240
 Y'all spend so much time trying to trick each other.

523
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.600
 Y'all got so much time on your hands.

524
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.680
 Just say the word.

525
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680
 - It's on the extreme.

526
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.520
 - Grumpy old man.

527
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.360
 - Hi.

528
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.200
 - Hi.

529
00:28:31.524 --> 00:28:35.524
 - Okay, okay, yeah, okay.

530
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:37.520
 - Fuck boy.

531
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.640
 - Old cat woman.

532
00:28:40.449 --> 00:28:41.480
 - Your ego.

533
00:28:42.924 --> 00:28:43.640
 - Okay.

534
00:28:46.477 --> 00:28:47.560
 - What is this?

535
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.400
 - Wait, no props.

536
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.800
 - No one cares, no one can see us.

537
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.720
 - Cheaters are shocking.

538
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.280
 - Says the woman who cheated on her fiance.

539
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.600
 - We were on a break, asshole.

540
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.776
 - You're either broken up for good, or you're cheating.

541
00:28:56.076 --> 00:28:57.642
 Either way, someone's lying to someone.

542
00:28:57.667 --> 00:28:58.640
 - I must have really gotten under your skin.

543
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.520
 - Roger, what is this?

544
00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.360
 - Fat, five.

545
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.676
 - What is the thing I'm holding in my hand?

546
00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:04.351
 - Fireworks.

547
00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:05.440
 - Fireworks by Katy Perry.

548
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.280
 - Hey.

549
00:29:07.188 --> 00:29:08.263
 - That is not fair.

550
00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:09.280
 - Hey, what, you're not fair.

551
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280
 - What's wrong with you?

552
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.440
 - Just stop.

553
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.280
 - What are you doing?

554
00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.120
 - What is wrong with you?

555
00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.960
 - Stop.

556
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.800
 - Oh God.

557
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.200
 - Oh God.

558
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.040
 - Sam, what the?

559
00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040
 - Oh my God.

560
00:29:21.365 --> 00:29:22.080
 - Ali.

561
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.360
 - Get back.

562
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.200
 - Sam.

563
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.040
 - Roger.

564
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.360
 - I've got this.

565
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.792
 - That's some gangster shit right there.

566
00:29:37.725 --> 00:29:38.400
 - Sorry.

567
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.240
 - Sorry.

568
00:29:41.598 --> 00:29:43.640
 - They're going to ruin our wedding.

569
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.640
 All that matters is that we're together.

570
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.640
 - It's true.

571
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:50.440
 - Look baby, I love you to the moon and back,

572
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.680
 but those two fuckwads are going to destroy our weekend,

573
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.760
 and our memories, which we are going to have

574
00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.520
 for a very long time, are headed straight over a cliff.

575
00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.975
 - It's going to be fine baby, we just have to.

576
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.160
 to stand there and profess our love.

577
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.580
 - It seems to me, their animus only surfaced

578
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.680
 after they spent a night together.

579
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680
 Am I accurate?

580
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.120
 - That's usually how it goes, honey.

581
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.800
 We crumple our feelings into a ball

582
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.280
 and shove 'em deep down so we can enjoy a bit of frisk.

583
00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.720
 - The solution appears to be simple then.

584
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.880
 We return them to the night they were spent.

585
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.320
 - Like we trick them into falling in love with each other?

586
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.160
 - He didn't say anything about love, honey.

587
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.760
 We just need to get them to jump each other's bones.

588
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.300
 - Yeah, come on!

589
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.880
 That was good, right?

590
00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.040
 That was good.

591
00:31:42.963 --> 00:31:45.880
 - You go, you go, you go, you go, you go.

592
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.560
 - She clearly has eyes for men.

593
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.760
 - Who does, father?

594
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.200
 - Hallie Spence, the sister.

595
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.520
 The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.

596
00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.720
 - You can't say that.

597
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.760
 - What the hell?

598
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.760
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

599
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760
 No, that was rude.

600
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.040
 I apologize to anyone that was listening,

601
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.040
 which can only be you, Pete,

602
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.880
 'cause you're the only person that was listening.

603
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.840
 I apologize.

604
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.320
 - I accept your apology and will now move on.

605
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.880
 Do you know Bea's been in love with Ben

606
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.600
 since the first night they met?

607
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.240
 - Well, why didn't she tell him?

608
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.480
 You know, when I was a young bloke and I liked a girl,

609
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.560
 I would sneak up behind her and I'd cut a lock of her hair

610
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.360
 and then I'd smack her on the bum!

611
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.200
 - What the hell?

612
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.560
 - I don't know, I'm not good at this, sorry.

613
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.280
 - Bea was just too scared to tell him,

614
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.920
 but I've talked to her and she says she regrets

615
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.200
 walking out that morning.

616
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.400
 - Tell me more, son.

617
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.240
 - Why me?

618
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.760
 - Because you're really good at it, right?

619
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.600
 You can do it.

620
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.440
 - Why me, why?

621
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.280
 - Why you put this hat on me?

622
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.000
 No one can see me, it's a radio play, motherfucker.

623
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 - Bea wants us to tell him how much she likes him,

624
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.920
 so he lets his guard down and goes to her.

625
00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.760
 Some Cupid's killed with arrows and some with traps.

626
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.720
 - That was good, I like that, that's good.

627
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.560
 - I just made it up.

628
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.280
 - So, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers,

629
00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.080
 and say, "Come to Papa."

630
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080
 - What are you doing?

631
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.680
 - I'm from a different generation.

632
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.720
 - And your generation sucks.

633
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.040
 You fucked up the whole world for us.

634
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.920
 - And I'm full of shame.

635
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.160
 But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.

636
00:32:57.751 --> 00:33:01.240
 - But Ben feels awful that he called her a disaster.

637
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.800
 I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.

638
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.680
 - Then why is he fighting with her?

639
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.480
 - Well, because he likes her.

640
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.400
 - And I know that Bea likes Ben.

641
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.560
 She's just denying herself because she's got in her head

642
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.800
 somehow that she'll never love again.

643
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.960
 - Whoa, I'm not talking about love, baby.

644
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.720
 I'm talking about dick.

645
00:33:17.466 --> 00:33:18.560
 - Oh, it's Ben.

646
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.400
 - Oh.

647
00:33:30.167 --> 00:33:31.160
 - Hey.

648
00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:33.000
 - You.

649
00:33:34.915 --> 00:33:37.760
 - Oh God, they got to you too?

650
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.600
 - What?

651
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.960
 - Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia

652
00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.120
 say how much I like you?

653
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.917
 - No.

654
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.225
 - Really?

655
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.720
 - It was Pete and Roger.

656
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.480
 - Fantastic, it's a team effort.

657
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.880
 They're trying to get us together.

658
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.320
 - No way.

659
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.160
 - Come here.

660
00:34:04.223 --> 00:34:06.560
 - Oh, maybe they want us to stop acting like assholes

661
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.640
 so we don't ruin the biggest event of their lives.

662
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.640
 - Us?

663
00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.840
 There is no us and assholes.

664
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.600
 You're the one who destroyed the living room.

665
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.800
 - Would you two mind helping me with something?

666
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.393
 - I hate to ask, but I'd really appreciate it.

667
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.760
 - Sure.

668
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.600
 - Yeah.

669
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:32.680
 - So Roger left his sunglasses on the sailboat.

670
00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:34.800
 I swear, if his head wasn't screwed on,

671
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.200
 we'd use it as a bowling ball.

672
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.880
 Do me a favor and swim out and get them.

673
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.400
 It's the one on the right.

674
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.240
 - Both of us.

675
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.800
 - Is that really a two person job?

676
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.240
 - Doesn't seem like it.

677
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.080
 - You two.

678
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.360
 - Yeah.

679
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.760
 - All right, so everyone's involved in this.

680
00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.600
 - I know.

681
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.173
 - I feel bad.

682
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.040
 - Me too.

683
00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.960
 - I don't want to bum Holly and Claudia out.

684
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.773
 - Just me and you.

685
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.160
 - Can you not swim?

686
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.240
 - I'm an excellent swimmer.

687
00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.600
 - Why are you so out of breath?

688
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.440
 - I'm fine.

689
00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:13.520
 How much further do you think?

690
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:14.960
 - Are your eyes closed?

691
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.480
 - I think it's dark.

692
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.840
 - Why are you so out of shape?

693
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.960
 You have like a 10 pop.

694
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:19.920
 - I'm not out of shape.

695
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.120
 I've been to 295, 300 once.

696
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.400
 I just don't do cardio.

697
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.708
 - Oh my God, you're hot girl fit.

698
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.160
 - I'm not hot girl fit.

699
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.698
 - Okay, my bad.

700
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.554
 We'll see you at the boat.

701
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.800
 - Wait, wait, wait.

702
00:35:57.779 --> 00:36:01.560
 - I could have done it myself, but whatever.

703
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.400
 Thanks.

704
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.960
 - No fucking way.

705
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.600
 - Honey, look who's here.

706
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.040
 - I cannot believe they did this.

707
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.880
 - Who is that?

708
00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.360
 - That is my ex, Jonathan.

709
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.200
 - Hey, hey.

710
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.120
 - What is he doing here?

711
00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.000
 - My Black Hawk helicopter parents

712
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.400
 have been trying to get us back together

713
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.680
 for the past four months.

714
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.400
 - They flew him halfway across the world

715
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.720
 to your sister's wedding?

716
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.760
 That's some deep off shit.

717
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.897
 They came to play.

718
00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.320
 - That's my parents.

719
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.480
 They think I'm throwing my life away.

720
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.240
 - Honey, we're just gonna take him back

721
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.840
 and get him all settled in.

722
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.880
 - I'll see you later.

723
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:39.880
 - You know, maybe we should do it.

724
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.480
 Just tell everyone we're together.

725
00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.320
 - What?

726
00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.400
 - It would solve that problem for me

727
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.680
 and that problem for you.

728
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:51.440
 - I don't have a problem.

729
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.040
 - You clearly want Margaret.

730
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:53.880
 - No, I don't.

731
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.720
 - Yes, you do.

732
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.120
 I saw the way you looked at her last night

733
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.760
 and I know she broke your heart.

734
00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.280
 She sees you're with me.

735
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.560
 She wants what she can't have

736
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.680
 and then bye bye crocodile Jack.

737
00:37:05.585 --> 00:37:06.920
 Fuck, he's fast.

738
00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:09.440
 - Making her jealous is not gonna work.

739
00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.680
 We're not in seventh grade.

740
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.800
 - Trust me, bro.

741
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.123
 We're all in seventh grade when it comes to this stuff.

742
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.880
 They've already gone through all of the bullshit

743
00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.680
 trying to trick us into each other's arms.

744
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.000
 Let's just embrace it.

745
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.640
 - There's no way we can convince anyone

746
00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.040
 we actually like each other.

747
00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:27.480
 - Yeah, you're right.

748
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.320
 - I know.

749
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.200
 You know, I still think about that night we spent together.

750
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.040
 - Shut up.

751
00:37:37.077 --> 00:37:38.280
 - No, I'm serious.

752
00:37:40.184 --> 00:37:42.080
 You know, this could be kind of fun.

753
00:37:43.003 --> 00:37:46.560
 We're at a wedding a million miles away from home.

754
00:37:48.081 --> 00:37:50.928
 Who knows what could happen under the cover of a masquerade.

755
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:56.080
 And that night at your place,

756
00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.560
 no matter how it ended, it was still pretty amazing.

757
00:38:07.526 --> 00:38:08.480
 Convincing enough?

758
00:38:12.168 --> 00:38:12.827
 - Fuck it.

759
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.480
 Let's do it.

760
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.440
 - Just wait.

761
00:38:23.253 --> 00:38:24.160
 Wait.

762
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.960
 - Okay, okay.

763
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.600
 Whoever wants to go on the hike, we need to leave now.

764
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.760
 We're running behind schedule.

765
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.600
 - Wait, wait, wait.

766
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.240
 Babe, the mountains have been there for millions of years.

767
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.240
 A few more minutes isn't gonna hurt them.

768
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.080
 - Baby, I know you are trying to calm me down

769
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.000
 and I love you for it.

770
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.840
 Thank you.

771
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.120
 But I am hurting cats right now

772
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:47.960
 and I need some help

773
00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.120
 instead of this easy breezy Martin Scorsese.

774
00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.080
 - Aw, jitters.

775
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.680
 Remember our wedding?

776
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.600
 Only that you're the most beautiful bride

777
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.760
 on God's green earth.

778
00:38:58.692 --> 00:38:59.960
 - Right answer.

779
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.840
 We're coming, we're coming, we're coming.

780
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.120
 Jinx, you owe me a cup.

781
00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.400
 Oh, you have a little something in your teeth.

782
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.240
 - Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.

783
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.840
 - Yeah, let me just take that out.

784
00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.040
 Oh, I gotta get it out.

785
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:10.880
 Oh, it's right there.

786
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.480
 - Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

787
00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.153
 - Honey, here he is.

788
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.760
 - Hey.

789
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.480
 - Jonathan.

790
00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.600
 - So nice to see you.

791
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.280
 - I had no idea you were coming.

792
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.720
 - So your parents didn't tell you, okay?

793
00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.880
 Yeah, you know, the first thing I asked them

794
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.440
 when they invited me was, "Does B know?"

795
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.003
 'Cause otherwise this would be really fucking awkward.

796
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.280
 And now it is fucking awkward.

797
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.840
 - No, no, not at all.

798
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.680
 - I'm in a lot of love.

799
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.520
 - No, you're like family.

800
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.840
 It'd be effing awkward if you weren't here.

801
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.960
 - I'm so glad you're here.

802
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.360
 - I'm so happy for you two.

803
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.360
 Hey, congratulations.

804
00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.200
 - Yeah, thanks.

805
00:39:43.158 --> 00:39:44.400
 - Right?

806
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.339
 - It's great to see you.

807
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.520
 - It's great to see you too.

808
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.680
 - We're all going on a hike,

809
00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.120
 so whoever wants to come with, we gotta move out.

810
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.640
 Let's move out.

811
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.726
 - Ben, meet Jonathan.

812
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.560
 - Oh, hey, man.

813
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.400
 I'm Ben.

814
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.040
 - Hey, oh, Pete and Claudia's friend, right?

815
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.909
 Also friends with Bea, among other things.

816
00:40:09.752 --> 00:40:11.000
 Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

817
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.741
 Okay, plenty of enough time in the car to do whatever the fuck this is.

818
00:40:14.766 --> 00:40:16.000
 Come on, let's go!

819
00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:19.000
 Yeah, okay. Yeah.

820
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 We need to come up with a game plan.

821
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 Yeah, you are so terrible at this.

822
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 What?

823
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.000
 We're doing this thing!

824
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Honey, I'm sorry.

825
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 I know we should have asked you, but we had to invite you.

826
00:40:31.727 --> 00:40:34.000
 Oh, it's totally fine. I'm glad he's here.

827
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 I love him and Holly loves him.

828
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Really?

829
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 Yeah.

830
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.438
 Great, okay. So we're spending a little time together away from the real world

831
00:40:41.463 --> 00:40:44.000
 and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.

832
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 Oh, no, Mom, guys, no.

833
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.413
 I totally forgot to tell you, but I'm with Ben.

834
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.351
 Do you want to come?

835
00:40:57.874 --> 00:41:00.301
 I think I'm going to hang back and yell at your parents.

836
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Have fun.

837
00:41:12.163 --> 00:41:15.629
 Alright, so is it like we just got together or we've been sneaking around?

838
00:41:15.654 --> 00:41:18.621
 Oh, I got it. What if we ran into each other at Chipotle,

839
00:41:18.646 --> 00:41:20.000
 lady in the tramp, the burrito?

840
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.565
 No.

841
00:41:21.548 --> 00:41:23.000
 This can't be that hard.

842
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 It's harder than you think. My parents don't even believe it yet.

843
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 You told them five seconds ago.

844
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 They know I would never go out with a guy like you.

845
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.210
 You've been with one guy your entire life.

846
00:41:31.668 --> 00:41:33.556
 Jonathan's a better man than you'll ever be.

847
00:41:33.581 --> 00:41:35.000
 And yet you left him.

848
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 Which is why exactly? Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.

849
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.749
 Okay, you don't know my boxes and you never will.

850
00:41:40.241 --> 00:41:42.000
 Just figure this out, please.

851
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 Okay.

852
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.000
 We just suck face in front of everybody.

853
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Half of them think they set us up anyway.

854
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 No, that's too much. We need to do something that's more hidden

855
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 so it feels more real, not some fuckboy wedding hookup.

856
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.760
 You're calling me a fuckboy like it's an insult?

857
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 I own that shit.

858
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 Let's just be affectionate.

859
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.266
 I know it's a foreign concept for you.

860
00:42:01.374 --> 00:42:03.000
 I can be affectionate.

861
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 I'll affectionate the shit out of you.

862
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 I can't believe your parents invited Jonathan.

863
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Now I have to find a table to sit him at.

864
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 What about Bea?

865
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 No, no, she's fine. She's sitting with us at our table.

866
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 No, I'm talking about how she's already at a low point because she's going through a breakup

867
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.584
 and I don't even know what's happening with school.

868
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:19.000
 She never even talks about it anymore.

869
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 I guess I could put up with the cousins.

870
00:42:21.253 --> 00:42:22.178
 Why?

871
00:42:25.028 --> 00:42:25.603
 You alright?

872
00:42:27.694 --> 00:42:29.000
 Oh, shit.

873
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 Wow.

874
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 Check it out, guys!

875
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Nice!

876
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Yeah!

877
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 Beautiful!

878
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 See, I told you it was going to be good.

879
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Man, that's nice.

880
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Oh, wow.

881
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Wow.

882
00:42:40.428 --> 00:42:41.000
 So beautiful.

883
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 There it is.

884
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 Feel the serenity.

885
00:42:43.444 --> 00:42:44.636
 Pretty spectacular, hey?

886
00:42:45.944 --> 00:42:47.000
 It's amazing.

887
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 Alright, your turn.

888
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.000
 Wow.

889
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 This is just so romantic.

890
00:42:57.102 --> 00:42:58.000
 Okay, nuzzle my neck.

891
00:42:58.682 --> 00:42:59.185
 Okay.

892
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.000
 Get in there.

893
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Damn, you are short.

894
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 You are not tall enough to say that.

895
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Oh.

896
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Oh, are you ticklish?

897
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.416
 No, I'm acting.

898
00:43:09.608 --> 00:43:10.608
 Like a toddler?

899
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:12.000
 No, go away.

900
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 Okay, I can use that.

901
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Beg me.

902
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 Beg me to stuff you in the butt.

903
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.073
 Stop!

904
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Just let me do it.

905
00:43:18.843 --> 00:43:21.000
 Permission to put my left hand on your right buttock.

906
00:43:22.135 --> 00:43:23.000
 Granted.

907
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Too hard.

908
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 Sorry.

909
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 You gotta sell it.

910
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Okay, not in circles.

911
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 It's not a magic lamp.

912
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 What?

913
00:43:45.672 --> 00:43:47.463
 Okay, now you're just playing bop it.

914
00:43:47.578 --> 00:43:49.000
 I've never rubbed a bopper show.

915
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.693
 Clearly, you've tried.

916
00:43:54.893 --> 00:43:56.000
 Are you not wearing underwear?

917
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 It's a swimsuit.

918
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 I'm on holiday.

919
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.457
 Oh.

920
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Okay, just mind the gap.

921
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 How's that?

922
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 That's good.

923
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 Just like, but you don't have to hover.

924
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 Just kind of, oh, man the woods.

925
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.263
 I'm sorry.

926
00:44:07.288 --> 00:44:08.181
 Okay, just take it out.

927
00:44:12.964 --> 00:44:14.000
 You try.

928
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 You want me to stick my finger in my own ass?

929
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 How's that gonna convince?

930
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Oh, on you.

931
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 I can't.

932
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Jesus Christ, it's like a vacuum pack down here.

933
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 How'd you get in this thing?

934
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Oh, man, it's tight.

935
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 Oh, see, it's like holding a baby bird.

936
00:44:28.457 --> 00:44:31.301
 God damn it.

937
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.769
 Were they not watching this whole time?

938
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 You like a mole or something on your butt?

939
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 No.

940
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Really? 'Cause I feel something.

941
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 I don't have a mole.

942
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 What the fuck?

943
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 What the fuck?

944
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 What the fuck?

945
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 What the fuck?

946
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 What the fuck?

947
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Are there any more on me?

948
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 I don't know.

949
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Jack, spiders hunt bears.

950
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 They hunt bears.

951
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.000
 No pictures.

952
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Put the cameras down.

953
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 We're not gonna take a spirit.

954
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Are there any more?

955
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 I don't know.

956
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Where are they?

957
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 I feel it.

958
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 I feel it.

959
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 I think I see something.

960
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 What do you see?

961
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 What do you see?

962
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Oh, no, that's just a part of you.

963
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 You're fine.

964
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.609
 All right, look, if I have one of those little fuckers in me,

965
00:45:18.634 --> 00:45:19.634
 they might be in you.

966
00:45:22.476 --> 00:45:23.241
 I'm good.

967
00:45:24.613 --> 00:45:26.000
 That's probably a better way to check than what I did.

968
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 Yeah.

969
00:45:32.889 --> 00:45:36.000
 All right, little one, we join your journey.

970
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 We do not inherit the earth.

971
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.139
 We just borrow it from our creatures.

972
00:45:42.463 --> 00:45:43.463
 Hey, guys.

973
00:45:43.488 --> 00:45:44.444
 What did we miss?

974
00:45:46.727 --> 00:45:47.765
 Wow.

975
00:45:57.368 --> 00:45:58.626
 Why can't I get this?

976
00:45:59.007 --> 00:46:01.496
 Because you're meant to learn to dive when you're six.

977
00:46:03.638 --> 00:46:04.676
 You got this, hon.

978
00:46:05.153 --> 00:46:06.805
 You ever try focusing on your toes?

979
00:46:07.348 --> 00:46:08.508
 My mom taught me this trick.

980
00:46:08.533 --> 00:46:11.000
 If you pretend like there's a string from your nose to your toes,

981
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.554
 you just kind of maintain that position.

982
00:46:13.715 --> 00:46:14.813
 You mind doing it again?

983
00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:16.838
 This time I'm going to shout out a tribute question.

984
00:46:16.944 --> 00:46:18.461
 I think it's just going to help clear your mind.

985
00:46:18.485 --> 00:46:20.860
 Just make sure it's a question about airplanes

986
00:46:20.896 --> 00:46:24.000
 or the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

987
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.089
 Okay, um, uh, what company created the Concorde?

988
00:46:30.339 --> 00:46:33.000
 A collaboration between British Airways and the French government.

989
00:46:33.716 --> 00:46:34.887
 How'd I do?

990
00:46:35.612 --> 00:46:36.659
 You're good there.

991
00:46:37.345 --> 00:46:40.000
 Maybe your mom can teach him how to dive.

992
00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:42.268
 She passed away.

993
00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.000
 Oh, I'm so sorry.

994
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 Yeah, sorry.

995
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 All right, I'm going to go again,

996
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.278
 but this time give me one with a little shorter answer.

997
00:46:50.859 --> 00:46:52.000
 I have a better idea.

998
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.476
 You just let me do everything, I'll guide you in.

999
00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.189
 Don't think.

1000
00:46:57.732 --> 00:46:59.000
 Be careful of his shoulder.

1001
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Yeah, I wrecked it jumping off a moving train in Paris.

1002
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.425
 Wouldn't let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.

1003
00:47:04.834 --> 00:47:06.000
 I had to tell her I love her.

1004
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 When you know she's the one, nothing else matters.

1005
00:47:18.298 --> 00:47:21.119
 I'm waving, thank you, thank you.

1006
00:47:21.729 --> 00:47:23.000
 There you go.

1007
00:47:24.583 --> 00:47:25.373
 Did I do it?

1008
00:47:25.716 --> 00:47:26.000
 Yeah.

1009
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 Yeah.

1010
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.325
 Good job, babe.

1011
00:47:28.716 --> 00:47:30.000
 Your dad's a natural.

1012
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.595
 I'm so glad you guys got to spend some time with Ben.

1013
00:47:32.776 --> 00:47:36.215
 Are you two really getting to know each other in a very respectful manner?

1014
00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.000
 One befitting such a kind and intelligent woman as your daughter.

1015
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.317
 Yes, we are in the early stages.

1016
00:47:41.342 --> 00:47:42.193
 Not too early.

1017
00:47:42.218 --> 00:47:43.812
 But also not so advanced.

1018
00:47:43.837 --> 00:47:47.789
 Just that magical moment when two people come together in this crazy journey we call life.

1019
00:47:48.237 --> 00:47:50.343
 That's why I was so worried when Jonathan showed up.

1020
00:47:50.562 --> 00:47:52.000
 I don't want to hurt his feelings.

1021
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 I even suggested we hide our light under a bushel for his sake.

1022
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.873
 But our love is just so strong.

1023
00:47:58.235 --> 00:47:59.818
 And I know what you guys are thinking.

1024
00:48:00.827 --> 00:48:02.000
 He's much older.

1025
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.590
 They weren't, right?

1026
00:48:04.346 --> 00:48:07.628
 Probably thinking I'm 27, early 28s.

1027
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:11.473
 Yes, we are very happy.

1028
00:48:11.498 --> 00:48:12.498
 Happiest.

1029
00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:13.523
 Yep.

1030
00:48:18.008 --> 00:48:20.000
 You know, you looked like that back in the day.

1031
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 No, I didn't.

1032
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 That guy's made out of cobblestone.

1033
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:26.000
 They're holding hands.

1034
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 I think it's working.

1035
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 I can't believe these dumbasses were so easily fooled.

1036
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:35.000
 Was that bullshit about your mom?

1037
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 What?

1038
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 The story about the giant wrench.

1039
00:48:38.336 --> 00:48:41.000
 I thought it might have been a lie until all your one night nothings.

1040
00:48:43.363 --> 00:48:45.000
 You ever heard that too?

1041
00:48:47.337 --> 00:48:49.000
 Like, I didn't mean...

1042
00:48:52.946 --> 00:48:54.000
 I'm sorry.

1043
00:48:55.241 --> 00:48:57.000
 And it wasn't a lie.

1044
00:48:59.466 --> 00:49:01.466
 Thanks for being so nice to my dad.

1045
00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:07.527
 You should probably rinse off.

1046
00:49:07.679 --> 00:49:09.971
 You have his SPF a billion on you now.

1047
00:49:18.135 --> 00:49:19.305
 Cheers, mate. I'll just grab a quickie.

1048
00:49:20.392 --> 00:49:20.924
 Okay.

1049
00:49:25.194 --> 00:49:26.735
 So, Australia.

1050
00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.976
 What do you reckon, eh?

1051
00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:29.001
 How you finding it?

1052
00:49:29.026 --> 00:49:30.697
 I don't know. It's great.

1053
00:49:30.722 --> 00:49:32.214
 Maz goes on about you all the time.

1054
00:49:32.675 --> 00:49:33.975
 Ripper Cunt, she calls you.

1055
00:49:34.586 --> 00:49:37.000
 Maz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is...

1056
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 Good friend.

1057
00:49:39.616 --> 00:49:40.911
 Oh, yeah.

1058
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.748
 You know you had a proper surf when sand gets all up your clacker.

1059
00:49:45.541 --> 00:49:46.541
 And your gobbler, too.

1060
00:49:47.167 --> 00:49:48.000
 Gobbler is...

1061
00:49:48.727 --> 00:49:49.990
 You know, your hog bonnet.

1062
00:49:51.237 --> 00:49:52.227
 You know, your beef cap.

1063
00:49:53.637 --> 00:49:55.637
 Come on, mate. You know, the anteater.

1064
00:49:58.415 --> 00:50:00.498
 Anyway, good to have ya.

1065
00:50:01.028 --> 00:50:01.868
 - Gotcha.

1066
00:50:05.373 --> 00:50:06.375
 - G'day, love.

1067
00:50:10.067 --> 00:50:11.680
 - Hey, mate.

1068
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.280
 Fancy a game?

1069
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.280
 - You're going down.

1070
00:50:18.064 --> 00:50:19.760
 How have you been doing?

1071
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.760
 - Pretty good.

1072
00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.320
 You?

1073
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.354
 - Okay, I guess.

1074
00:50:23.379 --> 00:50:24.859
 - How's school going?

1075
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.320
 Decide what kind of law you wanna practice yet?

1076
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.280
 - You know me.

1077
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.880
 I've never been one for practicing.

1078
00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.320
 - Still having second thoughts?

1079
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.320
 - Straight to third.

1080
00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.680
 - I know it's weird, me being here,

1081
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.360
 but believe me, I had nothing to do with it.

1082
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.320
 Your parents duped me, gave me the freaking flyer miles.

1083
00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.680
 - That's sweet.

1084
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.980
 You're part of the family.

1085
00:50:46.175 --> 00:50:49.060
 - I'd be lying if I said I haven't been thinking about you.

1086
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.160
 - Yeah, me too.

1087
00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.080
 - How long have you and that guy, Ben, been?

1088
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.920
 - It's kind of new.

1089
00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.880
 Not like new, new, but newish.

1090
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.480
 - Well, I think he seems great.

1091
00:51:07.075 --> 00:51:08.600
 - No, you don't.

1092
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.923
 - I really don't.

1093
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.280
 - Thanks for being so cool about all of this.

1094
00:51:16.184 --> 00:51:20.200
 Not just this, but this too.

1095
00:51:22.543 --> 00:51:24.320
 - It's really good to see you, Bea.

1096
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.480
 - I'm glad you're here.

1097
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.120
 - Now let's have fun.

1098
00:51:29.184 --> 00:51:30.040
 - Let's do it.

1099
00:51:44.705 --> 00:51:45.840
 - Mate.

1100
00:51:46.889 --> 00:51:48.400
 - That's me.

1101
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.000
 - You want a coffee?

1102
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.640
 It's the best in the world.

1103
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:54.040
 - You guys are really proud of your coffee here.

1104
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.975
 - It's the best in the fucking world.

1105
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:56.840
 - Okay.

1106
00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.160
 Enjoy.

1107
00:52:03.062 --> 00:52:04.120
 - Fuck, that is good.

1108
00:52:05.097 --> 00:52:07.440
 - I was thinking of going for a bit of a run later.

1109
00:52:08.554 --> 00:52:09.600
 Do you want to join?

1110
00:52:11.378 --> 00:52:13.440
 - I'm actually going on a bike ride with Bea,

1111
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.000
 so I don't think I can.

1112
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.080
 - She's a little sweet on you, hey?

1113
00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.200
 - Oh, you caught that.

1114
00:52:19.479 --> 00:52:21.720
 How long have you and Beau been together?

1115
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.160
 - Nah, we're just banging about.

1116
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.800
 He's nice, but I think I'm looking

1117
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.560
 for someone less casual.

1118
00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.440
 More romantic.

1119
00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.280
 - Wow.

1120
00:52:31.612 --> 00:52:33.760
 - Why did me and you ever break up anyway?

1121
00:52:34.966 --> 00:52:35.960
 - I don't really remember,

1122
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.680
 but I think you said something like

1123
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.302
 I was an immature, drongo, smothered in ex body spray.

1124
00:52:46.149 --> 00:52:49.000
 - Smells like you're not that guy anymore.

1125
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.960
 Bea's a lucky girl.

1126
00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.800
 - Oh.

1127
00:53:05.817 --> 00:53:07.236
 - Hey, open the door.

1128
00:53:07.655 --> 00:53:08.720
 Bea.

1129
00:53:10.209 --> 00:53:11.720
 - What's wrong?

1130
00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.120
 - Margaret thinks we're together.

1131
00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.040
 - That's great.

1132
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.560
 - No, Margaret needs to think

1133
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.840
 we're the right type of together.

1134
00:53:17.002 --> 00:53:19.120
 Not together together, but like situationally together.

1135
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.440
 'Cause if she thinks we're together together,

1136
00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.800
 she's not gonna break girl code.

1137
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.800
 So we need to finesse our togetherness

1138
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.960
 so that we're together,

1139
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.680
 but there's an opening for our togetherness

1140
00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.200
 and she can just slide right in

1141
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.280
 so that we can be together.

1142
00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.360
 - Are you on Coke?

1143
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.200
 - No, it's like coffee here.

1144
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.160
 It's like meth.

1145
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.480
 I'm guessing.

1146
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.400
 No, I'm not.

1147
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:35.440
 I worked at Goldman.

1148
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.320
 Partner's wedding.

1149
00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.280
 Do what you do.

1150
00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.040
 - Jesus, dude, who are you?

1151
00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.880
 - I'm a man trying to figure this out.

1152
00:53:41.915 --> 00:53:43.400
 Look at your room, it's so much bigger.

1153
00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.720
 You got a painting?

1154
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.480
 Wow, that's so red.

1155
00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.920
 We have to kick it up a notch.

1156
00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.480
 Make it feel like we're in the Gaga stage.

1157
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.160
 - What do you wanna do, take me in the hallway?

1158
00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.240
 - That is not Gaga.

1159
00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.080
 Actually, that could be construed as Gaga.

1160
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:56.080
 Tonight's the rehearsal dinner,

1161
00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:56.920
 so we have to do something

1162
00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920
 that makes it look like you're into me,

1163
00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.160
 but you're not into me.

1164
00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.000
 And I'm into you,

1165
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.202
 but you can tell by my face that it's never gonna mount.

1166
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.000
 - Get it together, man.

1167
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.600
 - You hit me so much.

1168
00:54:09.942 --> 00:54:10.840
 - Okay, Kalana,

1169
00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.640
 now pretend this is a real fox that messed up our garden.

1170
00:54:15.945 --> 00:54:16.960
 Fuck it up.

1171
00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.560
 Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up.

1172
00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.040
 Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up.

1173
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:20.880
 Fuck it up.

1174
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.720
 Ooh.

1175
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:22.840
 You see that?

1176
00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.000
 He did it, yeah.

1177
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.320
 Oh, hey, they're here.

1178
00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.960
 All right, everybody, wheels up.

1179
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.800
 - Hustle up.

1180
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.640
 - Bad dog.

1181
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.480
 - You look cute.

1182
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.480
 - Baby, you look so good.

1183
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.480
 - She's has been.

1184
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.560
 - You look so good.

1185
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.880
 - Yeah, I look bad.

1186
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:39.200
 - Man, this is the best time to say that.

1187
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.520
 - Daddy's a dad.

1188
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.120
 - Come on, let's go.

1189
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:42.960
 - Yeah.

1190
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.000
 - All right, let's do it.

1191
00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:03.800
 - Thank you.

1192
00:55:06.371 --> 00:55:09.440
 - You see the size of that boat?

1193
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.520
 - Hey, guys.

1194
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.360
 - Woo!

1195
00:55:20.876 --> 00:55:22.360
 - Nice touch.

1196
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:23.200
 - Nice dress.

1197
00:55:23.915 --> 00:55:26.160
 - You have a good heart.

1198
00:55:55.843 --> 00:55:56.480
 - I love this dress.

1199
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.320
 - You look fine.

1200
00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.160
 - Oh, thank you.

1201
00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.440
 - What would you like to drink?

1202
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.000
 - What's a traditional drink for a rehearsal dinner?

1203
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.080
 - Three scotches neat and a champagne for the lady.

1204
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.280
 - Oh, thank you.

1205
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.680
 - All right.

1206
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:07.800
 - You remembered.

1207
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.925
 - That you can't handle hard liquor?

1208
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.640
 Yeah, the smell's still not out of my car.

1209
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.600
 - You know I feel really bad about that.

1210
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.520
 - That was a fun night.

1211
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.760
 That was a fun summer.

1212
00:56:19.848 --> 00:56:20.760
 - Marks!

1213
00:56:22.767 --> 00:56:25.800
 Marks, captain says that we can steer the ship.

1214
00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.600
 - Oh, okay, I'm coming.

1215
00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:28.960
 Hang on, I've got heels on.

1216
00:56:30.184 --> 00:56:31.520
 - Look how lucky we are.

1217
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.960
 On a boat sailing back and forth

1218
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.720
 with no real transportation or reason.

1219
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.760
 - Okay.

1220
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.560
 - And look at you, Polly Pocket.

1221
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.840
 You the belle of the boat.

1222
00:56:45.248 --> 00:56:47.360
 - He didn't remember me.

1223
00:56:48.587 --> 00:56:50.867
 - Oh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?

1224
00:56:50.892 --> 00:56:54.680
 - No, honey, that's, yes, I think it might be.

1225
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.560
 Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.

1226
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.760
 - There it is.

1227
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.160
 - Well, at least that was subtle.

1228
00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.244
 - Was it?

1229
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:03.720
 - This oddly reminds me of prom.

1230
00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.720
 - The first or second time?

1231
00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.560
 - Jonathan is just the most perfect guy.

1232
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.440
 He's like a son to us.

1233
00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.840
 - Well, that might be a problem, mate.

1234
00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.920
 They might not wanna shag a brother.

1235
00:57:37.175 --> 00:57:38.240
 - So how's it going?

1236
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.680
 - Can parents back off a little?

1237
00:57:42.777 --> 00:57:44.077
 - How about you?

1238
00:57:50.364 --> 00:57:51.600
 - Game on.

1239
00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.680
 - Can you even dance?

1240
00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.840
 - You just let me lead.

1241
00:57:54.758 --> 00:57:55.600
 - Oh, God.

1242
00:58:05.073 --> 00:58:05.960
 - Let's go.

1243
00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.240
 - Is Margaret watching?

1244
00:58:47.167 --> 00:58:48.120
 - It's a little hard to tell

1245
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.360
 what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.

1246
00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.760
 - Everybody to the top deck,

1247
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.320
 we about to do a champagne toast.

1248
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.160
 - I'm with you.

1249
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.320
 - So what are we doing?

1250
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.320
 - Closing the deal.

1251
00:59:11.223 --> 00:59:12.496
 - Titanic me.

1252
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.560
 - What?

1253
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.360
 - Oh, help yourself to some champagne.

1254
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.200
 - Oh, thank you.

1255
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.320
 - Grab some drinks.

1256
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.160
 - Oh, great.

1257
00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.080
 - Nice.

1258
00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:19.920
 - Titanic me.

1259
00:59:21.383 --> 00:59:23.280
 - No, that is so lame.

1260
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.720
 - Exactly.

1261
00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.920
 The only people who would do something this lame

1262
00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.920
 are the ones who know how lame it is,

1263
00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.600
 but are in the first stages of liking each other,

1264
00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.160
 so they're totally comfortable in their mutual lameness.

1265
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.680
 Toast me.

1266
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.680
 - Oh my God.

1267
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.520
 - Come on.

1268
00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.480
 - This is so cringe.

1269
00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.960
 - So is saying cringe, old man.

1270
00:59:50.135 --> 00:59:51.280
 - Lift my arms.

1271
00:59:52.118 --> 00:59:53.360
 - I've seen the movie.

1272
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.200
 - Have you?

1273
00:59:58.232 --> 00:59:59.400
 - Okay.

1274
01:00:00.612 --> 01:00:02.000
 This is never gonna work.

1275
01:00:03.945 --> 01:00:07.545
 Aww! That is the cutest thing I've ever seen!

1276
01:00:07.573 --> 01:00:09.000
 Are they doing Titanic?

1277
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 Aww!

1278
01:00:14.285 --> 01:00:15.914
 Are they watching?

1279
01:00:18.123 --> 01:00:19.000
 Yep.

1280
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
 Are they buying it?

1281
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
 Can't imagine they would.

1282
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.000
 It's real. We did it.

1283
01:00:25.733 --> 01:00:28.271
 We're good. We're really bloody good.

1284
01:00:29.771 --> 01:00:31.771
 Jonathan, have you seen Tasmania?

1285
01:00:32.137 --> 01:00:34.000
 Inya, I'm fine. It's fine.

1286
01:00:44.635 --> 01:00:45.740
 Can I do the line?

1287
01:00:47.873 --> 01:00:50.253
 That's king of the world. You're king of the world.

1288
01:00:52.986 --> 01:00:54.427
 Jack, I'm flying!

1289
01:00:54.452 --> 01:00:55.000
 Okay, we can stop there.

1290
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
 We can stop there.

1291
01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:09.000
 They're gone. Show's over.

1292
01:01:11.881 --> 01:01:13.667
 Oh my god!

1293
01:01:18.982 --> 01:01:21.000
 No! Wait for me! Help! Wait!

1294
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
 Wait!

1295
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Bae!

1296
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Bea!

1297
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
 Are you okay?

1298
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
 Yeah.

1299
01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:43.511
 Why'd you jump in?

1300
01:01:43.536 --> 01:01:44.536
 To save you!

1301
01:01:44.561 --> 01:01:45.950
 But you're a terrible swimmer!

1302
01:01:45.975 --> 01:01:48.975
 I'm a great swimmer! Just short distances.

1303
01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:54.461
 We're gonna die.

1304
01:01:54.486 --> 01:01:55.486
 We're not gonna die.

1305
01:01:55.729 --> 01:01:57.151
 We're gonna get hypothermia.

1306
01:01:57.176 --> 01:01:58.176
 The water's 90 degrees.

1307
01:01:58.201 --> 01:01:59.631
 We're gonna get eaten by sharks.

1308
01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.970
 Fuck! We're gonna get eaten by sharks!

1309
01:02:05.181 --> 01:02:07.181
 We are gonna be fine.

1310
01:02:07.206 --> 01:02:10.206
 And we spent ten hours shredding water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.

1311
01:02:10.577 --> 01:02:11.577
 Goldman?

1312
01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:13.028
 Yeah, it was a partner's kids bar mitzvah.

1313
01:02:13.053 --> 01:02:14.241
 A little bit of crack.

1314
01:02:18.296 --> 01:02:19.296
 Oh my god!

1315
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:20.167
 Roger!

1316
01:02:20.192 --> 01:02:21.192
 Oh my god!

1317
01:02:21.217 --> 01:02:22.887
 It looks like they're going full Titanic.

1318
01:02:22.912 --> 01:02:24.381
 I love the commitment!

1319
01:02:24.406 --> 01:02:25.406
 Stop the boat!

1320
01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:26.431
 No, no, no.

1321
01:02:26.456 --> 01:02:27.456
 Help!

1322
01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:28.481
 They're coming!

1323
01:02:28.506 --> 01:02:29.506
 Stay calm!

1324
01:02:29.531 --> 01:02:30.124
 This is not a very good swim.

1325
01:02:30.149 --> 01:02:30.818
Bei!

1326
01:02:38.063 --> 01:02:38.776
 There.

1327
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:41.707
 Are you sure?

1328
01:02:41.975 --> 01:02:42.975
 Yeah.

1329
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
 Come on.

1330
01:02:49.296 --> 01:02:51.000
 Why aren't we turning the boat around?

1331
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
 We are in too shallow of water.

1332
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
 We'll run aground.

1333
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 But harbour rescue has been notified.

1334
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
 Come on.

1335
01:03:16.173 --> 01:03:17.000
 Are you good?

1336
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
 Mm-hmm.

1337
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
 Okay.

1338
01:03:25.452 --> 01:03:26.000
 All right.

1339
01:03:26.914 --> 01:03:27.914
 Okay.

1340
01:03:28.365 --> 01:03:29.000
 Let's go.

1341
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 All right, get in the row.

1342
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
 Okay.

1343
01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:37.465
 That was, um, probably the most--

1344
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.000
 I mean, if you didn't close it with Margaret, I don't--

1345
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.560
 There's nothing more romantic than jumping in to save me.

1346
01:03:44.732 --> 01:03:47.000
 Yeah, well, Jonathan didn't do it, that's for sure.

1347
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
 Your parents half the clock, that's shit.

1348
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
 You didn't even give him a chance.

1349
01:03:51.943 --> 01:03:54.000
 Why do you keep defending this guy?

1350
01:03:54.711 --> 01:03:56.722
 Why do you break up with him in the first place?

1351
01:03:56.747 --> 01:03:57.747
 It's complicated.

1352
01:03:57.772 --> 01:03:58.772
 It's never complicated.

1353
01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:00.000
 What, he cheated on you?

1354
01:04:00.143 --> 01:04:01.355
 Drug problem?

1355
01:04:01.974 --> 01:04:04.000
 Did you catch him measuring his dick with a ruler app?

1356
01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:08.000
 We never fought.

1357
01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:10.000
 Isn't that a good thing?

1358
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
 It was just comfortable.

1359
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.797
 And he's a great guy, which means there's no one out there for me

1360
01:04:14.822 --> 01:04:16.000
 because I had the best one.

1361
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 I couldn't even tell him I quit law school.

1362
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
 And I have no idea what I'm gonna do with my life.

1363
01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:27.000
 We're gonna get eaten by sharks, I had to tell somebody.

1364
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
 No one else knows?

1365
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
 I don't think this is the weekend to drop that bomb.

1366
01:04:32.984 --> 01:04:34.000
 You finally did it.

1367
01:04:34.612 --> 01:04:35.000
 What?

1368
01:04:35.584 --> 01:04:40.000
 You know, one night you said you didn't want to be a lawyer anyways.

1369
01:04:40.847 --> 01:04:42.000
 You remember that?

1370
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:47.000
 It was a memorable night, until you snuck out, of course.

1371
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:51.000
 Why did you?

1372
01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:56.000
 Because you scared the shit out of me.

1373
01:04:58.096 --> 01:05:02.000
 It was the first time in my life that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.

1374
01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.000
 I know a little bit about that.

1375
01:05:09.714 --> 01:05:11.600
 I was really hurt when you left.

1376
01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:15.000
 So I said all that terrible stuff about you to Pete.

1377
01:05:15.516 --> 01:05:17.000
 That's not how I felt.

1378
01:05:23.365 --> 01:05:25.000
 Look at us.

1379
01:05:25.823 --> 01:05:30.000
 Just a couple of fucked up people floating in the middle of the harbor.

1380
01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:35.000
 Promise me if we make it out alive we'll go see that from dry land.

1381
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
 It's a pretty killer view from here.

1382
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
 It's dumb but I want to see the people.

1383
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 Landmarks like those are full of people in love.

1384
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
 Marriage proposals, honeymooners, romantics jumping off of moving trains just to see the building with the person they love.

1385
01:05:50.793 --> 01:05:53.000
 Like your dad in the Eiffel Tower?

1386
01:05:54.485 --> 01:05:56.000
 He told you that?

1387
01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:59.000
 Nothing else matters when it comes to love.

1388
01:06:01.568 --> 01:06:03.000
 You could use a bit of that right now.

1389
01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:06.000
 It's not dumb.

1390
01:06:07.719 --> 01:06:09.000
 You, me and the opera house.

1391
01:06:09.847 --> 01:06:10.847
 It's a date.

1392
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:12.000
 I promise.

1393
01:07:09.656 --> 01:07:11.000
 What's wrong?

1394
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:14.000
 I'm a little afraid of flying.

1395
01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:16.561
 Don't you fly all the time for your job?

1396
01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:19.321
 I have a very specific routine.

1397
01:07:19.864 --> 01:07:23.305
 I mask, headphones, build my bubble.

1398
01:07:35.422 --> 01:07:37.000
 That's my Serenity song.

1399
01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.393
 How do you know my Serenity song?

1400
01:07:39.418 --> 01:07:40.418
 Don't worry about it.

1401
01:08:20.929 --> 01:08:22.000
 You all good?

1402
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.005
 Shut the fuck up now!

1403
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:08.000
 Thanks again.

1404
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.278
 Stay out of the water, yeah?

1405
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 Want some coffee?

1406
01:09:13.005 --> 01:09:15.000
 Not the stuff from here. I'll be up all night.

1407
01:09:16.195 --> 01:09:16.885
 Yeah.

1408
01:09:17.682 --> 01:09:19.000
 Thanks for kind of saving me though.

1409
01:09:20.158 --> 01:09:21.000
 It was fun.

1410
01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:23.000
 Stupid, but fun.

1411
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
 Well, that's the best kind.

1412
01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:37.000
 No, no, no, it's hot!

1413
01:09:38.373 --> 01:09:39.000
 I'm warm.

1414
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
 When are you ever gonna learn?

1415
01:09:43.389 --> 01:09:45.000
 Like, you want me to blow on it?

1416
01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.000
 Is it still hot?

1417
01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.908
 - We're getting pretty good at faking it.

1418
01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:47.000
 - I don't even know what's real anymore.

1419
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.374
 Everything I do just feels like a mistake.

1420
01:12:01.694 --> 01:12:04.694
 - Ben, Steve, are you guys all right?

1421
01:12:06.975 --> 01:12:08.975
 - Ben, wait, you hear?

1422
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
 - I can't hear you.

1423
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
 - Steve!

1424
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
 Beatrice!

1425
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 Beatrice!

1426
01:12:42.505 --> 01:12:45.000
 - Honey, what are these? Is that a handprint?

1427
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
 - No.

1428
01:13:43.966 --> 01:13:46.169
 - Come on, baby gorgeous.

1429
01:13:46.194 --> 01:13:48.000
 We got chores. Come on, let's go.

1430
01:13:49.266 --> 01:13:51.011
 Ben, are you ready? We got groom stuff to do.

1431
01:13:51.352 --> 01:13:52.670
 - Dude, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1432
01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:54.061
 - Man, I hope you scrub from top to bottom,

1433
01:13:54.086 --> 01:13:55.086
 'cause who knows what was in that heart rate.

1434
01:13:55.111 --> 01:13:57.111
 - I also showered last night.

1435
01:13:57.136 --> 01:13:59.136
 - Two showers in eight hours?

1436
01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:00.855
 Go off, King, get clean!

1437
01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:16.014
 - Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?

1438
01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:18.847
 - Yes, I'm so excited to marry Claudia.

1439
01:14:18.872 --> 01:14:20.665
 But, you know, I'm also hosting a party

1440
01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.531
 where it feels like we're all playing parts in a play,

1441
01:14:22.556 --> 01:14:23.974
 and I'm not really into the pageantry,

1442
01:14:23.999 --> 01:14:25.732
 and I kinda just wanna do a little--

1443
01:14:26.559 --> 01:14:28.724
 - All that matters is that you and Claudia

1444
01:14:28.749 --> 01:14:30.582
 run for the rest of your lives together.

1445
01:14:30.983 --> 01:14:32.000
 - I love you.

1446
01:14:32.025 --> 01:14:33.649
 - I love you too.

1447
01:14:33.674 --> 01:14:34.858
 - Bae?

1448
01:14:35.633 --> 01:14:38.384
 Hey, you're still good to get the cake, right?

1449
01:14:38.409 --> 01:14:39.540
 - Yes, ma'am.

1450
01:14:39.565 --> 01:14:41.000
 - Awesome. I put Margaret on it with you,

1451
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
 just to be safe.

1452
01:14:42.648 --> 01:14:44.000
 - Margaret.

1453
01:14:52.653 --> 01:14:54.095
 - All right, talk to me, baby.

1454
01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.361
 Who's it gonna be, Margaret or Bae?

1455
01:14:56.386 --> 01:14:57.911
 Come on, man, don't give me that.

1456
01:14:57.936 --> 01:14:59.661
 We're just two girls talking.

1457
01:14:59.686 --> 01:15:01.666
 I get it, though. It's tough.

1458
01:15:01.733 --> 01:15:03.000
 Magpie's your dream girl.

1459
01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:05.025
 She's confident, beautiful,

1460
01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:07.505
 and she knows how to put out a fire with her attire.

1461
01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.000
 Now Bae's waxing her other hand.

1462
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
 Whoo!

1463
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.079
 She's smart, funny, quick,

1464
01:15:12.104 --> 01:15:13.975
 and she got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of.

1465
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.029
 - Peter. - What?

1466
01:15:16.054 --> 01:15:17.660
 I'm not objectifying Margaret, man.

1467
01:15:17.685 --> 01:15:19.000
 That'd be inappropriate. That's my cousin.

1468
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.577
 - It's inappropriate with Bae too.

1469
01:15:20.602 --> 01:15:22.241
 - This is deeper than I thought.

1470
01:15:22.266 --> 01:15:23.884
 Hey, Sydney!

1471
01:15:23.909 --> 01:15:26.217
 My boy is in love!

1472
01:15:26.335 --> 01:15:27.708
 - Stop, dude, just stop. - What?

1473
01:15:27.733 --> 01:15:28.733
 - I know what you're doing.

1474
01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:30.086
 I know what you've all been doing.

1475
01:15:30.111 --> 01:15:32.037
 You set us up, and we went along with it.

1476
01:15:32.062 --> 01:15:33.062
 But it's fake.

1477
01:15:33.374 --> 01:15:34.374
 - It was my stepdad, right?

1478
01:15:34.399 --> 01:15:35.399
 He can't act for shit.

1479
01:15:35.858 --> 01:15:36.858
 - You suck too, bro.

1480
01:15:36.883 --> 01:15:37.883
 - That's foul, dog.

1481
01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:39.908
 It's definitely gotta be Bae, man.

1482
01:15:39.933 --> 01:15:40.933
 - I don't know, man.

1483
01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:41.958
 I don't fucking know.

1484
01:15:41.983 --> 01:15:42.983
 She doesn't know what she wants.

1485
01:15:43.008 --> 01:15:46.008
 She's single for basically the first time in her life.

1486
01:15:46.033 --> 01:15:47.033
 She just quit law school.

1487
01:15:47.058 --> 01:15:49.058
 Her fucking fiancé's here.

1488
01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:51.083
 - Man, stop with all the white boy--

1489
01:15:51.108 --> 01:15:53.108
 - What the-- - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1490
01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:54.133
 Seriously.

1491
01:15:54.158 --> 01:15:56.258
 Anytime something gets real, you run away,

1492
01:15:56.283 --> 01:15:58.283
 call yourself a fuckboy, make an excuse,

1493
01:15:58.308 --> 01:15:59.867
 and you just move on to the next.

1494
01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:01.417
 It's Bae.

1495
01:16:01.899 --> 01:16:03.521
 We jumped off a boat for her.

1496
01:16:07.315 --> 01:16:08.499
 - Oh, that's perfect.

1497
01:16:08.524 --> 01:16:09.457
 They're gonna love it.

1498
01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:10.482
 Thank you so much.

1499
01:16:10.507 --> 01:16:11.741
 - Let me get this boxed up for you.

1500
01:16:11.766 --> 01:16:13.766
 - Thank you. - Thank you.

1501
01:16:14.774 --> 01:16:16.616
 - I don't get all the pageantry of weddings.

1502
01:16:16.641 --> 01:16:17.975
 If you like someone, give 'em a snog.

1503
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
 Keep it to yourselves.

1504
01:16:19.427 --> 01:16:21.427
 - I wore a wedding dress for Halloween

1505
01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:22.452
 for five years in a row.

1506
01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:23.183
 - Stop it.

1507
01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:24.208
 - No, I know.

1508
01:16:24.233 --> 01:16:25.233
 It's so pathetic.

1509
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:27.452
 But I am with you now.

1510
01:16:27.477 --> 01:16:29.252
 This is not for me.

1511
01:16:29.277 --> 01:16:31.152
 - So you and Ben aren't serious?

1512
01:16:31.177 --> 01:16:32.925
 - What?

1513
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:34.950
 No, no, it's just...

1514
01:16:35.403 --> 01:16:38.528
 we're just situationally together.

1515
01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:39.912
 - 'Cause when I saw you last night in the harbor,

1516
01:16:39.937 --> 01:16:41.476
 I thought it might be more with you two.

1517
01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:44.600
 - Just...situationally.

1518
01:16:44.625 --> 01:16:47.625
 - Is that an American thing? - I don't even know.

1519
01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:50.650
 - So you're right if I have a go at him, then?

1520
01:16:51.034 --> 01:16:53.000
 I feel like I might have made a mistake letting him loose.

1521
01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:57.566
 - If that's not okay, just tell me.

1522
01:16:57.591 --> 01:16:58.708
 For real.

1523
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:03.000
 - I know he really likes you.

1524
01:17:07.595 --> 01:17:09.832
 - How do you think I should play this with Ben?

1525
01:17:09.857 --> 01:17:12.357
 Should I wait until after the wedding?

1526
01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:14.285
 - Um...I don't know.

1527
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:15.059
 - Have you guys hooked up?

1528
01:17:15.084 --> 01:17:16.084
 - Hey. - We're Beatrice.

1529
01:17:16.109 --> 01:17:17.309
 - You quit school?

1530
01:17:17.334 --> 01:17:19.334
 - You're just gonna pour gasoline on everything you've worked for?

1531
01:17:19.359 --> 01:17:21.000
 - Is there still time to re-enroll?

1532
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
 - Soon as you broke up with Jonathan, everything turned to pot.

1533
01:17:23.286 --> 01:17:25.781
 - Are you on drugs? Because at least then I'd understand.

1534
01:17:25.806 --> 01:17:28.755
 - Who told you I quit law school? Was it Ben?

1535
01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.780
 - You quit school? - What?

1536
01:17:29.805 --> 01:17:31.000
 - When were you gonna tell us?

1537
01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:32.364
 - Is this to get back at us?

1538
01:17:32.389 --> 01:17:34.000
 I'm sorry if we pushed you to succeed your whole life.

1539
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
 We're such awful parents.

1540
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
 - Mom, this isn't about you.

1541
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
 - Yes it is. It is about us.

1542
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
 And no, we're not gonna let you throw away your life

1543
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
 because you're going through something.

1544
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
 Everyone is always going through something.

1545
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
 It's called life.

1546
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
 - Hey.

1547
01:17:49.801 --> 01:17:51.000
 - I can't believe you.

1548
01:17:51.354 --> 01:17:52.622
 You told him I quit school?

1549
01:17:52.647 --> 01:17:53.391
 - No, I didn't.

1550
01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:55.000
 - You told Pete. Pete told us.

1551
01:17:55.468 --> 01:17:56.354
 - I told you what?

1552
01:17:56.379 --> 01:17:58.944
 - Yeah, no, I told Pete, but I didn't mean it like that.

1553
01:17:58.969 --> 01:17:59.691
 - Told me what?

1554
01:17:59.864 --> 01:18:01.392
 - That we're gonna find out at some point.

1555
01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:02.901
 - That's not for you to decide.

1556
01:18:02.926 --> 01:18:03.768
 - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1557
01:18:03.793 --> 01:18:05.611
 - It doesn't matter how we found out.

1558
01:18:05.636 --> 01:18:06.383
 - Found out what?

1559
01:18:06.408 --> 01:18:08.000
 - She quit law school.

1560
01:18:08.244 --> 01:18:09.000
 - Oh, yeah, I knew that.

1561
01:18:09.222 --> 01:18:10.222
 - You're real shit.

1562
01:18:10.403 --> 01:18:12.000
 - I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

1563
01:18:12.281 --> 01:18:14.281
 - There's a reason why you're alone. No one can trust you.

1564
01:18:14.947 --> 01:18:16.000
 - Yeah, what's your reason?

1565
01:18:16.573 --> 01:18:17.975
 - Guys like you.

1566
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
 - Keep telling yourself that.

1567
01:18:20.549 --> 01:18:21.000
 - Fuck off.

1568
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.628
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't do this right here, right now.

1569
01:18:23.653 --> 01:18:25.505
 I messed this all up. It's all on me.

1570
01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:27.585
 - Why don't we all go for a swim, eh?

1571
01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:28.952
 Cool off before the wedding?

1572
01:18:28.977 --> 01:18:30.715
 - That's a great idea. Maybe early drinks?

1573
01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:34.793
 - Guys, I am so sorry, but your plan is all ruined.

1574
01:18:34.818 --> 01:18:37.000
 We are not together. We were faking it the whole time.

1575
01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:38.631
 - You knew?

1576
01:18:38.656 --> 01:18:39.861
 - What are they even talking about?

1577
01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:43.045
 - Well, we may have orchestrated a union between the pair of them

1578
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:45.420
 in order for peace to prevail across the land.

1579
01:18:45.518 --> 01:18:46.518
 - You lied to us?

1580
01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:49.028
 What have you been honest about lately?

1581
01:18:49.053 --> 01:18:50.653
 - So you lied to me too?

1582
01:18:50.897 --> 01:18:52.000
 You're not together?

1583
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
 - I could never be with someone like him.

1584
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
 - Yeah, 'cause I'm the one who fucked it up.

1585
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.355
 - You did fuck it up.

1586
01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:58.147
 - I fucked it up?

1587
01:18:58.172 --> 01:18:59.000
 - Yeah, you fucked it up.

1588
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
 - I fucked it up?

1589
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
 - You fucked it up.

1590
01:19:01.756 --> 01:19:02.756
 - Oh, no.

1591
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:04.000
 - Bad dog, Kalonofin.

1592
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
 I mean, good dog, you killed that shit,

1593
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.742
 but next time read the room, Kaymoney.

1594
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
 - I am so sorry.

1595
01:19:26.048 --> 01:19:27.000
 - Hey, uh...

1596
01:19:29.046 --> 01:19:30.000
 - Bae.

1597
01:19:33.103 --> 01:19:34.427
 - I think he's gonna be fine.

1598
01:19:34.452 --> 01:19:35.452
 He's gonna be fine.

1599
01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:37.000
 He's gonna be fine.

1600
01:20:11.499 --> 01:20:14.687
 Good, you're perfect.

1601
01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.260
 Relax, you're working yourself up.

1602
01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.260
 It is not fine. It is not everything.

1603
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.611
 It is fine.

1604
01:20:44.636 --> 01:20:47.235
 Okay, all we asked of them was to come out here,

1605
01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.568
 celebrate us, and they are ruining it.

1606
01:20:49.593 --> 01:20:51.593
 And all week and I have been so stressed,

1607
01:20:52.065 --> 01:20:54.235
 and you've been more worried about what's going on with bae

1608
01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.260
 than with me.

1609
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:57.260
 Well, you've been more concerned about your planning.

1610
01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:00.052
 Are you marrying me or your itinerary?

1611
01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.260
 Well, if that's how you feel,

1612
01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.149
 then why are we even doing this?

1613
01:21:07.082 --> 01:21:08.760
 I don't know.

1614
01:21:08.785 --> 01:21:10.042
 You tell me.

1615
01:21:17.964 --> 01:21:19.701
 There's one last thing we need to fake.

1616
01:21:49.003 --> 01:21:51.260
 Claudia, Allie, we're assholes.

1617
01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.563
 We're really sorry.

1618
01:21:53.588 --> 01:21:56.516
 I'm a terrible sister, and he's a terrible friend.

1619
01:21:56.877 --> 01:21:58.541
 It's your guys' big day.

1620
01:21:58.566 --> 01:22:00.260
 We're not gonna mess it up, we promise.

1621
01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:02.594
 Uh-huh, but just so you both know,

1622
01:22:02.619 --> 01:22:05.260
 if you fuck up today, the something I borrowed

1623
01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.260
 is a knife, and it's shiny and new.

1624
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.260
 Love is intoxicating.

1625
01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:59.260
 It envelops you, it tickles you,

1626
01:22:59.605 --> 01:23:02.260
 and it makes you feel like you can walk on air.

1627
01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.260
 It's like this wind.

1628
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:06.260
 It's in your bones, it's in your breath,

1629
01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.030
 it's in every beat of your heart.

1630
01:23:08.055 --> 01:23:10.260
 You can't look for it, you can't describe it,

1631
01:23:10.696 --> 01:23:12.939
 and you can't escape it.

1632
01:23:13.013 --> 01:23:16.260
 Allie, I love you so much,

1633
01:23:16.656 --> 01:23:18.865
 and I don't think I say it enough.

1634
01:23:18.926 --> 01:23:20.926
 You are the yin to my yang,

1635
01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:23.260
 peanut butter to my jelly,

1636
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.499
 and I will love you forever and always.

1637
01:23:25.786 --> 01:23:29.229
 Claudia, I love you with so much of my heart

1638
01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:32.260
 that none is left to protest.

1639
01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:33.891
 That's very good.

1640
01:23:33.916 --> 01:23:35.916
 Just made it up.

1641
01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:38.378
 A lot of it.

1642
01:23:46.452 --> 01:23:49.146
 I now pronounce you married!

1643
01:23:56.452 --> 01:23:57.162
 Yeah!

1644
01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.016
 Oh, look, there she is.

1645
01:24:28.905 --> 01:24:30.260
 Oh, hey, parents.

1646
01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:32.260
 Is that Tasmania?

1647
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.260
 Yeah.

1648
01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:36.023
 How are you doing, honey?

1649
01:24:36.048 --> 01:24:39.048
 I am so sorry I lied to you guys about school.

1650
01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.260
 I didn't want to disappoint you guys again.

1651
01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:43.260
 Well, if you'd just told us, maybe we could have--

1652
01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:44.543
 Trying to talk me out of it?

1653
01:24:44.568 --> 01:24:46.568
 No, maybe we could have supported you.

1654
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:49.260
 I know this is scary for you guys.

1655
01:24:50.184 --> 01:24:51.740
 Yeah, it's scary for me too,

1656
01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:54.260
 and I gotta figure it out on my own.

1657
01:24:54.577 --> 01:24:57.042
 I know that every now and then

1658
01:24:57.067 --> 01:24:58.260
 we might come off as a little...

1659
01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.671
 Controlling?

1660
01:24:59.696 --> 01:25:00.260
 No.

1661
01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.260
 Overbearing?

1662
01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:01.844
 No.

1663
01:25:01.869 --> 01:25:02.869
 Actually crazy?

1664
01:25:02.894 --> 01:25:03.585
 Yes.

1665
01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:07.160
 That's it, but only because we love you so much.

1666
01:25:09.726 --> 01:25:10.974
 Love you.

1667
01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.260
 Good luck.

1668
01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:17.260
 Good luck.

1669
01:25:48.192 --> 01:25:48.701
 Hi, Aunt.

1670
01:25:48.734 --> 01:25:49.260
 Yes?

1671
01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:50.260
 Do you mind if I steal a hand?

1672
01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.805
 Uh, not at all.

1673
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:52.260
 Go ahead.

1674
01:25:53.252 --> 01:25:53.615
 High five.

1675
01:25:56.170 --> 01:25:56.882
 Hey.

1676
01:25:58.889 --> 01:25:59.480
 Hi.

1677
01:26:01.748 --> 01:26:02.748
 Where's Bo?

1678
01:26:03.041 --> 01:26:04.260
 He buggered off.

1679
01:26:04.736 --> 01:26:08.260
 He said he saw a wave he couldn't morally not surf.

1680
01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:09.260
 I'm sorry.

1681
01:26:09.964 --> 01:26:12.260
 It was never really anything.

1682
01:26:13.172 --> 01:26:14.260
 And you and Bea.

1683
01:26:14.728 --> 01:26:18.260
 She said you were just situational.

1684
01:26:18.783 --> 01:26:20.260
 She said that?

1685
01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:33.926
 Are you good?

1686
01:26:34.074 --> 01:26:37.260
 Yeah, we know it's been a tough weekend for you.

1687
01:26:38.233 --> 01:26:39.260
 I don't know.

1688
01:26:39.825 --> 01:26:42.260
 These last few days really made me realize

1689
01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:44.260
 how much I miss you.

1690
01:26:47.113 --> 01:26:48.722
 Why don't you just go for a walk?

1691
01:26:48.755 --> 01:26:49.260
 Figure your head.

1692
01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:50.260
 Yeah, we'll go with you.

1693
01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:51.260
 No, we won't.

1694
01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.260
 No.

1695
01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.260
 I love you, but this is our wedding.

1696
01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:55.260
 So...

1697
01:26:55.612 --> 01:26:56.260
 Are you sure?

1698
01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:57.260
 Yeah.

1699
01:26:57.830 --> 01:27:00.260
 I might go and do some people watching.

1700
01:27:00.922 --> 01:27:02.260
 Just not...

1701
01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.260
 these people.

1702
01:27:07.348 --> 01:27:08.260
 Thank you.

1703
01:27:18.388 --> 01:27:19.260
 Wow.

1704
01:27:20.862 --> 01:27:21.499
 Ben.

1705
01:27:27.845 --> 01:27:29.845
 I wanted this for so long.

1706
01:27:32.049 --> 01:27:34.260
 But I think I'm just holding on to a memory.

1707
01:27:35.301 --> 01:27:36.493
 And also, I...

1708
01:27:40.913 --> 01:27:42.260
 I'm sorry.

1709
01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:44.260
 I'm so sorry.

1710
01:28:26.943 --> 01:28:28.637
 I've never seen Bea like this before.

1711
01:28:28.662 --> 01:28:29.260
 Really?

1712
01:28:30.351 --> 01:28:31.963
 You were the one who said there's a thin line

1713
01:28:31.988 --> 01:28:33.260
 between love and hate.

1714
01:28:33.566 --> 01:28:36.337
 You're always the first person to say that bit, you know?

1715
01:28:36.362 --> 01:28:37.260
 I know it sounds crazy,

1716
01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.260
 but even when they were yapping at each other,

1717
01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:41.260
 I've never seen Bea happier.

1718
01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:43.260
 Same with Ben.

1719
01:28:43.727 --> 01:28:46.260
 Hey, stepfather, may I have a word?

1720
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.507
 Yes, but make it quick, son.

1721
01:28:47.532 --> 01:28:50.312
 I promised my lady a dance, but don't tell your mother.

1722
01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.260
 You're so clever.

1723
01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.260
 You know who's also clever?

1724
01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.260
 Ben.

1725
01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:58.260
 You know who else would be perfect for Ben?

1726
01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.260
 That mumbly girl who always looks like she's got a secret.

1727
01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.260
 You know her name is Bea.

1728
01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.260
 That was a callback.

1729
01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:05.831
 Will you stop?

1730
01:29:06.023 --> 01:29:07.023
 Stop.

1731
01:29:08.186 --> 01:29:09.694
 How you going, mate? How you going, Ben?

1732
01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:10.719
 What, you two?

1733
01:29:11.293 --> 01:29:12.046
 What?

1734
01:29:12.071 --> 01:29:15.583
 Just enough with the loud talking and the overhearing.

1735
01:29:15.608 --> 01:29:16.608
 Just stop.

1736
01:29:16.633 --> 01:29:18.260
 Bro, we literally didn't know you were standing there.

1737
01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:19.260
 Yeah, it's true. We didn't know you were listening.

1738
01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:20.260
 We did.

1739
01:29:20.538 --> 01:29:21.260
 It was greatly a performance for one.

1740
01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:22.857
 And we nailed it, too.

1741
01:29:22.882 --> 01:29:23.882
 What is with you people?

1742
01:29:24.343 --> 01:29:26.260
 This entire weekend, I have been lied to

1743
01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.856
 and manipulated and puppeteered.

1744
01:29:29.485 --> 01:29:31.418
 I don't know what is real and what is not.

1745
01:29:31.443 --> 01:29:33.260
 Mate, I know you're a little blurry,

1746
01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.260
 but I meant what I said up there about love.

1747
01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:39.260
 It's too precious a resource to be wasted.

1748
01:29:40.044 --> 01:29:41.260
 I haven't seen her. Is she, uh--

1749
01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.260
 She went on a walk a while ago.

1750
01:29:43.829 --> 01:29:46.260
 After she saw you kissing Margaret.

1751
01:29:46.588 --> 01:29:48.260
 What?

1752
01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.260
 No, I didn't kiss Margaret.

1753
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:51.260
 Margaret kissed me. I backed up.

1754
01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.260
 I don't want to be with Margaret.

1755
01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:53.260
 I want to--

1756
01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.260
 Stop it.

1757
01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:55.260
 You gorgeous idiot.

1758
01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.260
 Run. Don't wait on love.

1759
01:29:57.682 --> 01:29:58.682
 Fight for it.

1760
01:29:58.947 --> 01:30:01.043
 And don't worry about the age difference.

1761
01:30:01.072 --> 01:30:02.000
 I'm 29.

1762
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.100
 Honey, no one's 29.

1763
01:30:05.574 --> 01:30:06.492
 Do you know where she went?

1764
01:30:06.517 --> 01:30:09.164
 She said she wanted to walk around, do some people watching.

1765
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:10.574
 That's what she said?

1766
01:30:10.663 --> 01:30:11.538
 People watching?

1767
01:30:11.563 --> 01:30:14.380
 I think it was more of a euphemism for crying alone.

1768
01:30:15.565 --> 01:30:17.565
 No, it's not.

1769
01:30:18.157 --> 01:30:19.830
 I think I know where she might be.

1770
01:30:19.855 --> 01:30:21.855
 Good God, man, go get her.

1771
01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:23.447
 Scour the city block by block.

1772
01:30:23.472 --> 01:30:24.681
 Scan the grid.

1773
01:30:24.706 --> 01:30:25.956
 First north, south, then east, west.

1774
01:30:25.981 --> 01:30:27.347
 Leo, I know exactly where she is.

1775
01:30:27.372 --> 01:30:29.372
 It makes it a lot easier.

1776
01:30:35.258 --> 01:30:38.000
 I just need to find my moving train.

1777
01:30:40.402 --> 01:30:42.000
 What's going on here?

1778
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
 Is that coffee?

1779
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
 Yeah.

1780
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
 Oh, wait.

1781
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.521
 Call harbor rescue!

1782
01:30:52.546 --> 01:30:56.000
 Oh, my God!

1783
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
 Oh, my God!

1784
01:31:04.328 --> 01:31:07.016
 What the hell? Are you crazy?

1785
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
 Please ask a favor!

1786
01:32:22.917 --> 01:32:25.617
 Why don't you just treat people like my folks?

1787
01:32:25.641 --> 01:32:27.641
 Just go get the girl.

1788
01:32:27.666 --> 01:32:29.666
 Thank you!

1789
01:32:39.078 --> 01:32:40.808
 Excuse me!

1790
01:32:40.833 --> 01:32:42.833
 Excuse me!

1791
01:32:55.215 --> 01:32:57.215
 I didn't kiss Margaret. She kissed me.

1792
01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.240
 I know that's a bullshit excuse, but it's true.

1793
01:33:00.985 --> 01:33:02.000
 I couldn't find a moving train.

1794
01:33:02.815 --> 01:33:04.849
 Sorry, it's the best I could do.

1795
01:33:05.293 --> 01:33:07.090
 Are you out of your mind?

1796
01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:08.000
 Yeah.

1797
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
 Because it's been two years since we met

1798
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
 and I haven't spent every single day with you.

1799
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
 That's the sign of a crazy person.

1800
01:33:14.858 --> 01:33:16.000
 I hated you.

1801
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.661
 I didn't really give you a choice.

1802
01:33:17.686 --> 01:33:19.350
 I definitely didn't hate you.

1803
01:33:19.375 --> 01:33:21.139
 You called me a bitch.

1804
01:33:21.164 --> 01:33:22.821
 I said you were acting like a bitch.

1805
01:33:22.846 --> 01:33:23.854
 No, I was a bitch.

1806
01:33:25.487 --> 01:33:26.537
 The way I handled everything.

1807
01:33:26.562 --> 01:33:27.733
 The way I handled the first night.

1808
01:33:27.758 --> 01:33:29.485
 The way I handled last night.

1809
01:33:30.321 --> 01:33:32.310
 Yeah, it wasn't really awesome.

1810
01:33:32.777 --> 01:33:34.766
 Why did you leave?

1811
01:33:35.377 --> 01:33:37.377
 I thought you were going to regret it.

1812
01:33:37.677 --> 01:33:40.178
 And I couldn't face the idea of losing someone else

1813
01:33:40.203 --> 01:33:41.517
 that I...

1814
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
 I really loved.

1815
01:33:45.909 --> 01:33:48.360
 Last night was the first thing I haven't regretted

1816
01:33:48.385 --> 01:33:50.000
 in a long time.

1817
01:33:52.376 --> 01:33:54.000
 I love the way we fight.

1818
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
 I love how smart you are.

1819
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
 I love the weird way you

1820
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
 stick your hands down my pants.

1821
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.834
 And I love how you know what you don't want.

1822
01:34:03.634 --> 01:34:05.212
 And if it's not me,

1823
01:34:05.512 --> 01:34:06.654
 if I don't

1824
01:34:06.679 --> 01:34:08.000
 check all your boxes,

1825
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.502
 if I'm not the one,

1826
01:34:09.527 --> 01:34:11.224
 I get it.

1827
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
 That would really,

1828
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
 really fucking suck.

1829
01:34:21.988 --> 01:34:24.000
 So, you gonna kiss me now?

1830
01:34:25.828 --> 01:34:28.000
 Yeah, I am.

1831
01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:44.000
 That's a lot of running for Mr. No Cardio.

1832
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
 Yeah, I'm dying. I need some air.

1833
01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:50.697
 How do they know my Serenity song?

1834
01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.360
 - I'm sorry you almost called off your wedding

1835
01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.920
 because of all of our bullshit.

1836
01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.160
 - What? - What?

1837
01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.880
 - I saw you arguing on the porch.

1838
01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.360
 - Oh, no, no, no, we staged a fake fight

1839
01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360
 so you guys would feel bad and make up.

1840
01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.640
 - Are you marrying your precious itinerary or me?

1841
01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:30.560
 - Well, if that's how you feel,

1842
01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.660
 I don't know why we're doing this anymore.

1843
01:37:34.828 --> 01:37:35.760
 - Thank you very much.

1844
01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.600
 - Puppets.

1845
01:37:37.395 --> 01:37:38.580
 We're just puppets.

1846
01:37:39.406 --> 01:37:40.420
 - Yep.
