00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.992
When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:44.995
with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,

3
00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.290
I started having these dreams of flying

4
00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:51.126
I was free

5
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.967
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up

6
00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:16.277
In cryo, you don't dream at all

7
00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:19.321
It doesn't feel like six years

8
00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.824
More like a fifth of teguila
and an ass-kicking

9
00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:30.207
Tommy was the scientist, not me

10
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.502
He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space

11
00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:34.879
to find the answers

12
00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:37.381
Are we there yet?

13
00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:39.258
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

14
00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:41.385
We're there.

15
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.928
It's about your brother

16
00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:49.393
So, a week before
Tommy's gonna ship out,

17
00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:53.188
a guy with a gun ends his journey
for the paper in his wallet

18
00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:58.360
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

19
00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.363
You will be hungry.
You will be weak.

20
00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.033
If you feel nausea,
please use the sacks--

21
00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:06.118
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist

22
00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:09.413
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's gonna regret

23
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.304
Up ahead was Pandora

24
00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:30.684
You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there

25
00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:44.114
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

26
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.034
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

27
00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.664
And since your genome is identical to his,
you could step into his shoes,

28
00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:54.583
so to speak.

29
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:03.551
It'd be a fresh start
on a new world

30
00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:12.893
And the pay is good

31
00:03:14.103 --> 00:03:15.479
Very good.

32
00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:40.796
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

33
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.214
Remember, people,
you lose that mask,

34
00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:45.968
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

35
00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:49.388
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

36
00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:53.851
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

37
00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:55.728
Crossing outer marker.
Mine is in sight.

38
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:35.267
One life ends,

39
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.478
another begins

40
00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:47.238
Harnesses off!
Get your packs!

41
00:04:47.363 --> 00:04:50.783
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

42
00:04:50.908 --> 00:04:54.870
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

43
00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:57.540
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

44
00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:07.883
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

45
00:05:12.763 --> 00:05:14.765
There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine

46
00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:18.811
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude

47
00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:22.940
I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass

48
00:05:27.903 --> 00:05:30.781
They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,

49
00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:33.576
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy

50
00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:38.414
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

51
00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.207
Well, well, ladies.

52
00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:43.502
Look at all this fresh meat!

53
00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:53.429
Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

54
00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.014
fighting for freedom

55
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.272
Look out, hot rod!

56
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.609
But out here they're just hired guns,

57
00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:09.528
taking the money,
working for the company

58
00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:10.988
Check this out, man.

59
00:06:11.655 --> 00:06:13.115
Meals on wheels.

60
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.328
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

61
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.246
I got two guys free
in about 20 minutes!

62
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:20.873
Got it! Need them!

63
00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:32.426
You're not in Kansas anymore

64
00:06:34.887 --> 00:06:38.766
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:42.603
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

66
00:06:44.897 --> 00:06:46.482
If there is a hell,

67
00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:51.862
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

68
00:06:52.738 --> 00:06:54.865
Out there, beyond that fence,

69
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.286
every living thing that crawls,
flies or squats in the mud

70
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:02.540
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

71
00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:09.213
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

72
00:07:09.338 --> 00:07:11.632
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

73
00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:14.510
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

74
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:18.931
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

75
00:07:19.598 --> 00:07:21.392
They are very hard to kill.

76
00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:26.855
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

77
00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:30.568
I will not succeed.

78
00:07:32.778 --> 00:07:34.154
Not with all of you.

79
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:37.283
If you wish to survive,

80
00:07:37.408 --> 00:07:40.244
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

81
00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:43.247
You've got to obey the rules.

82
00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:46.041
Pandora rules.

83
00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.003
Rule number one--

84
00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:50.754
There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief

85
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.548
to put your mind at ease

86
00:07:54.925 --> 00:08:00.431
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

87
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.350
Wow! You look just like him.

88
00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:07.187
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

89
00:08:07.313 --> 00:08:09.273
...into the bio-lab.

90
00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:14.528
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

91
00:08:14.653 --> 00:08:15.863
- Hi.
- Hey.

92
00:08:15.988 --> 00:08:17.531
Link-- Here's the link room right here.

93
00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:19.909
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

94
00:08:21.744 --> 00:08:23.787
Me and Norm are here to drive

95
00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:27.041
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars

96
00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:32.129
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives

97
00:08:32.254 --> 00:08:34.173
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

98
00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:36.634
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

99
00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:40.512
Damn! They got big.

100
00:08:40.638 --> 00:08:43.140
Yeah, they fully mature
on the flight out.

101
00:08:43.265 --> 00:08:45.559
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

102
00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:47.519
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

103
00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:49.480
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

104
00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:51.482
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

105
00:08:52.024 --> 00:08:53.359
There's yours.

106
00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:56.654
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

107
00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:59.615
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

108
00:09:23.556 --> 00:09:25.015
Looks like him.

109
00:09:26.308 --> 00:09:28.102
No, it looks like you.

110
00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:31.146
This is your avatar now, Jake.

111
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:38.779
And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,

112
00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:41.657
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

113
00:09:43.075 --> 00:09:44.493
or something

114
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.249
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

115
00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.168
which is insanely expensive

116
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:57.381
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

117
00:09:57.506 --> 00:09:59.633
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

118
00:09:59.758 --> 00:10:01.760
You know, what we see, what we feel.

119
00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:04.555
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.

120
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.057
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

121
00:10:07.182 --> 00:10:09.935
All right. Whatever.

122
00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:13.564
So--

123
00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:16.066
Well, here I am,

124
00:10:17.776 --> 00:10:19.236
doing science.

125
00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:21.989
They're coming out!

126
00:10:22.114 --> 00:10:24.575
Attention.
Drivers coming out of link

127
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.250
Oh, God.

128
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:36.879
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

129
00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:43.302
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

130
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.848
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.

131
00:10:47.973 --> 00:10:50.434
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

132
00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:53.270
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

133
00:10:53.395 --> 00:10:55.606
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

134
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.983
Here she is,
Cinderella back from the ball.

135
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.779
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

136
00:11:03.572 --> 00:11:07.243
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

137
00:11:08.327 --> 00:11:10.496
May the All Mother

138
00:11:10.663 --> 00:11:12.665
smile upon our first meeting

139
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:15.960
Not bad.
You sound a little formal

140
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.338
I studied for five years

141
00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:21.507
but there is much to learn

142
00:11:21.757 --> 00:11:25.219
- Grace? This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.

143
00:11:25.803 --> 00:11:29.807
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

144
00:11:29.932 --> 00:11:33.519
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

145
00:11:33.644 --> 00:11:35.020
He's dead.

146
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:38.065
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

147
00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:42.486
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.

148
00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:47.074
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

149
00:11:47.199 --> 00:11:49.493
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

150
00:11:49.618 --> 00:11:50.828
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

151
00:11:50.953 --> 00:11:53.497
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!

152
00:11:53.622 --> 00:11:54.999
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

153
00:11:55.124 --> 00:11:57.960
He has no business sticking his nose
in my department.

154
00:11:59.044 --> 00:12:02.798
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

155
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.019
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

156
00:12:15.144 --> 00:12:17.938
Hover taxi, Delta runway.
Squawk ident.

157
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:25.070
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

158
00:12:25.196 --> 00:12:27.239
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

159
00:12:27.364 --> 00:12:30.242
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

160
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.333
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

161
00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:40.377
but now I see that
you're intentionally screwing me.

162
00:12:40.502 --> 00:12:44.006
Grace, you know,
I enjoy our little talks.

163
00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:51.847
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

164
00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:53.599
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

165
00:12:53.724 --> 00:12:55.184
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

166
00:12:55.309 --> 00:12:57.269
How is this in any way lucky?

167
00:12:57.394 --> 00:12:59.104
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

168
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.107
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

169
00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:04.109
A Marine we can use.

170
00:13:04.235 --> 00:13:06.070
I'm assigning him to your team
as security escort.

171
00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:09.615
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

172
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.575
Look, look, you're supposed
to be winning the hearts

173
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.701
and the minds of the natives.

174
00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:14.620
Isn't that the whole point
of your little puppet show?

175
00:13:14.745 --> 00:13:16.205
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

176
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.957
then they'll start trusting us.

177
00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:20.042
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

178
00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:22.127
but after, what, how many years?

179
00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:23.754
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

180
00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:27.091
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

181
00:13:27.216 --> 00:13:29.301
Right. Come here.

182
00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:32.137
I can't-- I can't--

183
00:13:35.391 --> 00:13:38.310
This is why we're here.
Unobtanium.

184
00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:41.480
Because this little gray rock
sells for 20 million a kilo.

185
00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:44.817
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

186
00:13:44.942 --> 00:13:46.777
It's what pays for your science.

187
00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:51.282
Now, those savages are threatening
our whole operation,

188
00:13:51.407 --> 00:13:52.616
we're on the brink of war,

189
00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:55.911
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

190
00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:59.498
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

191
00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:12.928
So, how much link time have you logged?

192
00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:16.640
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.

193
00:14:16.765 --> 00:14:21.061
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

194
00:14:21.186 --> 00:14:23.814
Zip. But I read a manual.

195
00:14:24.815 --> 00:14:26.817
Tell me you're joking.

196
00:14:28.193 --> 00:14:29.528
This is cool.

197
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.405
Let's go.

198
00:14:35.367 --> 00:14:37.036
Don't. I got this.

199
00:14:41.457 --> 00:14:44.001
So you just figured
you'd come out here,

200
00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:46.712
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

201
00:14:46.837 --> 00:14:50.549
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

202
00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:52.927
What was going through your head?

203
00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:55.846
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

204
00:14:56.972 --> 00:14:59.225
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

205
00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:03.979
Keep your arms in,
hands in, head down.

206
00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:08.901
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

207
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.487
That shouldn't be hard for you.

208
00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:13.405
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white--

209
00:15:13.572 --> 00:15:14.907
Initiate link.

210
00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:18.202
Run sequence unit three. Go.

211
00:15:18.327 --> 00:15:19.745
Launching.

212
00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:26.627
I have the first congruency.

213
00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:40.558
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
- Go figure.

214
00:15:40.683 --> 00:15:42.601
Phase-lock 40%.

215
00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:48.148
All right. Going in.

216
00:15:48.816 --> 00:15:50.359
I'm going in in four.

217
00:15:53.445 --> 00:15:56.031
Phase-lock 99%.
Link is stable.

218
00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:16.760
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

219
00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:18.429
Pupillary reflex is good

220
00:16:21.223 --> 00:16:24.226
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

221
00:16:24.977 --> 00:16:26.312
Hey, guys.

222
00:16:27.229 --> 00:16:28.939
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

223
00:16:29.064 --> 00:16:30.399
Good!

224
00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:31.984
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

225
00:16:32.109 --> 00:16:34.153
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

226
00:16:34.278 --> 00:16:35.654
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

227
00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.323
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

228
00:16:37.448 --> 00:16:39.533
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,

229
00:16:39.658 --> 00:16:40.910
- that's fine.
- Okay, good. Just take it

230
00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:43.996
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

231
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:47.541
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!

232
00:16:47.666 --> 00:16:49.376
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

233
00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:54.006
Distal motor control is good.
Good, Jake.

234
00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:56.717
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

235
00:16:58.093 --> 00:16:59.345
That's great, Jake.
Hold on, now.

236
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.680
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

237
00:17:01.805 --> 00:17:04.308
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

238
00:17:04.433 --> 00:17:06.477
- so take it easy.
- Wait.

239
00:17:06.602 --> 00:17:08.020
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

240
00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:10.522
Jake! Listen to me.
Jake!

241
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.858
- I need you to sit down. Jake!
- It's okay.

242
00:17:12.983 --> 00:17:14.693
- Buddy, listen to me.
- It's all good. I got this.

243
00:17:14.818 --> 00:17:18.447
- Jake, you need to sit down right now.
- Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

244
00:17:18.572 --> 00:17:20.658
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

245
00:17:20.783 --> 00:17:23.536
You need time to adjust to the avatar--
Whoa! Jake!

246
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:25.871
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

247
00:17:25.996 --> 00:17:30.042
Sedate! Sedate him!
A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

248
00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:32.419
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

249
00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:33.546
By the numbers

250
00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:35.047
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me

251
00:17:35.172 --> 00:17:36.715
You're not used to your avatar body.

252
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.467
- This is dangerous.
- This is great

253
00:17:38.592 --> 00:17:41.804
- Jake? Jake, listen to me.
- Come on. They're gonna put you out

254
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.059
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

255
00:17:47.184 --> 00:17:48.727
God damn it!
Bring them home!

256
00:17:48.852 --> 00:17:51.438
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

257
00:17:53.232 --> 00:17:57.069
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

258
00:17:57.194 --> 00:17:58.737
I don't even have to play defense on it.

259
00:17:58.863 --> 00:18:00.281
Hey, guys. Hey.

260
00:18:00.406 --> 00:18:02.658
- It's okay, I'll get him.
- Jake, you have to come back!

261
00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:04.535
Jake! Jake!
Excuse me.

262
00:18:07.121 --> 00:18:08.706
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

263
00:18:08.831 --> 00:18:10.249
Come on!

264
00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:14.211
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

265
00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:26.140
- Jeez! Sorry.
- Watch it!

266
00:18:48.454 --> 00:18:49.955
Hey, Marine!

267
00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:52.166
Damn.

268
00:18:54.251 --> 00:18:57.379
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

269
00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.132
Think fast.

270
00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:03.177
Motor controI's looking good.

271
00:19:13.062 --> 00:19:17.358
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

272
00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:19.568
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

273
00:19:19.693 --> 00:19:21.111
Hey, hey, hey!

274
00:19:21.654 --> 00:19:23.864
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

275
00:19:23.989 --> 00:19:25.407
That's kind of freaky.

276
00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:27.952
Come on. Scat.

277
00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:30.329
Good night.

278
00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:35.167
Lights out!
See you at dinner, kiddies.

279
00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:00.234
Welcome back.

280
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.536
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

281
00:20:12.288 --> 00:20:17.501
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

282
00:20:18.127 --> 00:20:19.753
Hold on a second.

283
00:20:20.296 --> 00:20:23.173
Hey, Wainfleet!
Get it done!

284
00:20:23.632 --> 00:20:27.761
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

285
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.431
Vine strike's still loose.

286
00:20:30.556 --> 00:20:32.683
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

287
00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:34.101
Watch it!

288
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.438
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

289
00:20:37.563 --> 00:20:39.189
Or the biggest.

290
00:20:39.315 --> 00:20:42.109
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

291
00:20:42.234 --> 00:20:43.986
I thought you'd never ask.

292
00:20:45.362 --> 00:20:48.490
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

293
00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:01.629
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

294
00:21:01.754 --> 00:21:04.298
This low gravity'll make you soft.

295
00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:07.301
You get soft,

296
00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:13.807
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

297
00:21:14.934 --> 00:21:17.478
I pulled your record, Corporal.

298
00:21:17.603 --> 00:21:19.980
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

299
00:21:21.982 --> 00:21:24.235
Nothing like this here, though.

300
00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:29.865
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

301
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.825
I figured it's just another hellhole.

302
00:21:31.951 --> 00:21:34.328
I was First Recon myself.

303
00:21:34.453 --> 00:21:37.665
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

304
00:21:38.624 --> 00:21:41.502
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

305
00:21:41.627 --> 00:21:43.045
I come out here?

306
00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:47.132
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail louie?

307
00:21:47.258 --> 00:21:51.762
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

308
00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:57.518
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

309
00:21:57.643 --> 00:22:00.479
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

310
00:22:02.523 --> 00:22:08.362
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

311
00:22:08.487 --> 00:22:15.411
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

312
00:22:15.536 --> 00:22:17.162
- Clear!
- Clear!

313
00:22:22.334 --> 00:22:27.464
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

314
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.216
Give me the goose bumps.

315
00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:32.720
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

316
00:22:32.845 --> 00:22:34.513
right on the ground.

317
00:22:35.806 --> 00:22:37.725
Right in the hostiles' camp.

318
00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:43.856
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

319
00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:45.608
I want you to gain their trust.

320
00:22:45.733 --> 00:22:47.443
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

321
00:22:47.568 --> 00:22:50.070
or hammer them hard if they won't.

322
00:22:51.572 --> 00:22:53.782
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

323
00:22:53.908 --> 00:22:57.995
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

324
00:22:59.538 --> 00:23:01.081
but you report to me.

325
00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:04.293
Can you do that for me, son?

326
00:23:05.878 --> 00:23:07.254
Hell, yeah, sir.

327
00:23:08.172 --> 00:23:09.924
Well, all right, then.

328
00:23:20.976 --> 00:23:23.854
Son, I take care of my own.

329
00:23:23.979 --> 00:23:25.064
You get me what I need,

330
00:23:25.189 --> 00:23:28.400
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

331
00:23:29.318 --> 00:23:30.778
Your real legs.

332
00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:35.533
That sounds real good, sir.

333
00:23:42.206 --> 00:23:44.917
- Link's ready!
- Phase-lock 40%.

334
00:23:45.543 --> 00:23:48.629
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

335
00:23:48.754 --> 00:23:52.258
I have five congruencies.
Phase-lock 90%.

336
00:23:52.383 --> 00:23:53.634
Link three ready.

337
00:23:54.343 --> 00:23:55.970
All right, I'm going in.

338
00:25:05.998 --> 00:25:08.375
Shut it down.
We're gonna stay a while.

339
00:25:11.837 --> 00:25:15.591
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

340
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.223
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

341
00:25:24.725 --> 00:25:26.352
You the man, Doc.

342
00:26:02.972 --> 00:26:06.016
Prolemuris.
They're not aggressive.

343
00:26:08.644 --> 00:26:12.106
Relax, Marine.
You're making me nervous.

344
00:26:17.695 --> 00:26:20.281
So, how will they know we're here?

345
00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:23.033
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

346
00:26:25.494 --> 00:26:27.454
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

347
00:26:29.874 --> 00:26:33.460
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

348
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.049
Wow! It's that fast?

349
00:26:41.343 --> 00:26:43.387
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

350
00:26:43.512 --> 00:26:47.266
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

351
00:26:47.391 --> 00:26:50.978
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

352
00:26:51.103 --> 00:26:52.730
Okay. Sample.

353
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.986
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

354
00:26:59.695 --> 00:27:03.616
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

355
00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:05.826
Right.

356
00:27:33.687 --> 00:27:35.523
So, here I go.

357
00:28:01.006 --> 00:28:04.843
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

358
00:28:08.597 --> 00:28:10.182
It's already pissed off.

359
00:28:10.432 --> 00:28:13.269
Jake, that armor's too thick.
Trust me.

360
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:23.237
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

361
00:28:23.904 --> 00:28:25.614
So, what do I do,
dance with it?

362
00:28:26.115 --> 00:28:29.159
Just hold your ground.

363
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.635
Yeah? Come on!
What you got?

364
00:28:47.803 --> 00:28:49.763
Oh, yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

365
00:28:50.806 --> 00:28:53.142
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, bitch.

366
00:28:54.727 --> 00:28:57.271
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

367
00:28:57.396 --> 00:29:00.274
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

368
00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:03.360
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

369
00:29:06.488 --> 00:29:07.615
Oh, shit.

370
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.879
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

371
00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:25.341
Run! Definitely run!

372
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:13.152
I'm gonna have to call it, guys

373
00:33:13.277 --> 00:33:16.113
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

374
00:33:17.907 --> 00:33:21.118
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have
to hang on till morning

375
00:33:21.243 --> 00:33:22.786
He won't make it till morning.

376
00:35:15.733 --> 00:35:17.651
I don't have all goddamn night.

377
00:35:18.527 --> 00:35:20.613
Come on! Come on!

378
00:36:34.603 --> 00:36:36.188
Hey, wait. Don't!

379
00:36:39.775 --> 00:36:40.818
Great.

380
00:37:38.334 --> 00:37:41.837
Look, I know you probably
don't understand this,

381
00:37:47.968 --> 00:37:49.136
but thank you.

382
00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.726
Thank you.

383
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.190
That was pretty impressive.

384
00:38:03.984 --> 00:38:06.862
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was--

385
00:38:10.491 --> 00:38:13.536
Hey, wait a second.
Hey, where you going?

386
00:38:14.578 --> 00:38:15.996
Wait up!

387
00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:18.541
Just-- Hey, slow down.

388
00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:21.669
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

389
00:38:22.836 --> 00:38:25.839
- Damn!
- Don't thank.

390
00:38:26.757 --> 00:38:29.093
You don't thank for this.

391
00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:34.598
This is sad.
Very sad only.

392
00:38:35.558 --> 00:38:37.643
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

393
00:38:38.519 --> 00:38:40.271
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

394
00:38:43.816 --> 00:38:46.944
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

395
00:38:47.862 --> 00:38:49.864
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

396
00:38:49.989 --> 00:38:51.615
Your fault!

397
00:38:52.116 --> 00:38:54.827
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

398
00:38:54.952 --> 00:38:58.581
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

399
00:38:58.706 --> 00:39:00.124
Easy.

400
00:39:02.418 --> 00:39:04.795
Fine. Fine.

401
00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:08.090
If you love your little forest friends,

402
00:39:09.717 --> 00:39:11.510
why not let them just kill my ass?

403
00:39:12.553 --> 00:39:14.263
What's the thinking?

404
00:39:15.097 --> 00:39:17.766
- Why save you?
- Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

405
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:24.190
You have a strong heart.

406
00:39:26.317 --> 00:39:27.526
No fear.

407
00:39:32.072 --> 00:39:34.909
But stupid!
Ignorant like a child.

408
00:39:41.332 --> 00:39:43.751
Well, if I'm like a child, then--

409
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.587
Look, maybe you should teach me.

410
00:39:46.712 --> 00:39:48.923
Sky People cannot learn.
You do not see.

411
00:39:49.048 --> 00:39:50.841
Well, then teach me how to see.

412
00:39:50.966 --> 00:39:53.427
- No one can teach you to see.
- Whoa.

413
00:39:54.803 --> 00:39:57.223
Look, come on,
can't we talk?

414
00:39:58.182 --> 00:40:02.061
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

415
00:40:06.899 --> 00:40:08.609
You're like a baby.

416
00:40:14.823 --> 00:40:16.408
I need your help.

417
00:40:17.493 --> 00:40:19.328
You should not be here.

418
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:23.123
- Okay, take me with you.
- No! Go back.

419
00:40:25.834 --> 00:40:26.835
No.

420
00:40:28.337 --> 00:40:29.547
Go back.

421
00:40:51.193 --> 00:40:52.194
No!

422
00:41:14.049 --> 00:41:15.175
What--

423
00:41:19.013 --> 00:41:20.472
What are they?

424
00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:23.809
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

425
00:41:24.894 --> 00:41:26.520
Very pure spirits.

426
00:41:50.628 --> 00:41:52.546
What was that all about?

427
00:41:54.715 --> 00:41:55.758
Come.

428
00:41:57.259 --> 00:41:58.302
Come!

429
00:42:00.554 --> 00:42:02.223
Where are we going?

430
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:13.526
Come.

431
00:42:18.197 --> 00:42:19.907
What's your name?

432
00:42:20.032 --> 00:42:21.075
Shit!

433
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.643
Okay.

434
00:42:50.396 --> 00:42:53.190
Calm people, calm

435
00:42:58.946 --> 00:43:01.740
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

436
00:43:04.243 --> 00:43:07.079
These demons are forbidden here

437
00:43:07.955 --> 00:43:10.207
There has been a sign

438
00:43:10.332 --> 00:43:12.626
This is a matter for the Tsahik

439
00:43:17.464 --> 00:43:18.424
Bring him

440
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:21.635
What's going on?

441
00:43:24.013 --> 00:43:25.055
Wait.

442
00:43:28.058 --> 00:43:29.643
What's happening?

443
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:31.562
Hey!

444
00:44:41.674 --> 00:44:42.925
Father

445
00:44:43.842 --> 00:44:45.594
I see you

446
00:44:57.398 --> 00:44:58.774
This creature--

447
00:44:59.108 --> 00:45:02.152
why do you bring him here?

448
00:45:03.612 --> 00:45:04.989
I was going to kill him

449
00:45:05.322 --> 00:45:07.116
but there was a sing from Eywa

450
00:45:07.324 --> 00:45:09.285
I have said

451
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.579
no dreamwalker will come here

452
00:45:11.704 --> 00:45:13.038
What's he saying?

453
00:45:13.539 --> 00:45:15.958
His alien smell fills my nose

454
00:45:16.083 --> 00:45:17.084
Hey, what's he saying?

455
00:45:17.209 --> 00:45:19.962
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

456
00:45:21.463 --> 00:45:24.383
Your father.
It's nice to meet you, sir.

457
00:45:28.012 --> 00:45:29.430
Step back!

458
00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.768
I will look at this alien

459
00:45:34.894 --> 00:45:36.437
That is Mother.

460
00:45:36.562 --> 00:45:40.482
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

461
00:45:41.358 --> 00:45:42.693
Who's Eywa?

462
00:45:49.575 --> 00:45:51.285
What are you called?

463
00:45:52.286 --> 00:45:53.621
Jake Sully.

464
00:46:03.547 --> 00:46:06.300
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.

465
00:46:07.718 --> 00:46:10.638
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

466
00:46:10.763 --> 00:46:14.099
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

467
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:17.895
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

468
00:46:19.188 --> 00:46:21.815
Just ask Dr. Augustine.
I'm no scientist.

469
00:46:21.941 --> 00:46:23.317
What are you?

470
00:46:25.611 --> 00:46:28.822
I was a Marine. A--

471
00:46:29.698 --> 00:46:32.326
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

472
00:46:32.785 --> 00:46:33.994
A warrior!

473
00:46:34.119 --> 00:46:35.579
I could kill him easily!

474
00:46:35.579 --> 00:46:36.830
No!

475
00:46:37.373 --> 00:46:41.502
This is the first warrior dreamwalker

476
00:46:41.627 --> 00:46:43.462
we have seen

477
00:46:43.587 --> 00:46:46.340
We need to learn more about him

478
00:46:48.842 --> 00:46:50.678
My Daughter--

479
00:46:50.803 --> 00:46:55.057
you will teach him our way,

480
00:46:55.182 --> 00:46:58.561
to speak and walk as we do

481
00:46:58.686 --> 00:47:02.231
Why me? That's not fair

482
00:47:03.107 --> 00:47:07.194
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

483
00:47:07.319 --> 00:47:10.865
Learn well, Jakesully.

484
00:47:11.699 --> 00:47:15.494
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

485
00:47:34.221 --> 00:47:35.681
Good evening.

486
00:47:38.726 --> 00:47:40.477
Please don't get up.

487
00:47:42.396 --> 00:47:43.689
Excuse me.

488
00:47:46.025 --> 00:47:47.151
Sorry.

489
00:47:50.279 --> 00:47:51.989
Hey, how you doing?

490
00:48:35.699 --> 00:48:37.952
- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha

491
00:48:38.077 --> 00:48:41.080
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake. Jake!

492
00:48:42.957 --> 00:48:45.960
Come on back, kid. Come on.
That's it.

493
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:50.297
There you go.
There you go, there you go.

494
00:48:50.422 --> 00:48:52.758
You're okay. You're okay.

495
00:48:52.883 --> 00:48:55.761
Damn!
You were dug in like a tick.

496
00:48:58.889 --> 00:49:01.433
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.

497
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.271
And you are not gonna believe
where I am.

498
00:49:06.313 --> 00:49:09.275
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

499
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.404
disappearing into the brush
with this angry thanator coming after him.

500
00:49:13.529 --> 00:49:16.448
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

501
00:49:16.574 --> 00:49:18.868
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

502
00:49:18.993 --> 00:49:22.246
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

503
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:25.082
"Jarhead clan"?

504
00:49:26.709 --> 00:49:29.712
- And it worked?
- Hey, I'm practically family.

505
00:49:30.838 --> 00:49:34.258
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

506
00:49:34.383 --> 00:49:35.926
That's called taking the initiative, son.

507
00:49:36.051 --> 00:49:38.512
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look, Sully. Sully.

508
00:49:38.637 --> 00:49:42.016
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

509
00:49:42.808 --> 00:49:48.564
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

510
00:49:48.689 --> 00:49:50.482
But no, no, no, they like mud.

511
00:49:50.608 --> 00:49:54.486
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're--

512
00:49:55.112 --> 00:49:58.157
Hey, can you-- Can somebody just--
Sector 12.

513
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.078
Okay, go, go, go, stop.
Stop--

514
00:50:03.204 --> 00:50:05.289
Rich, stop!
That's-- Jesus!

515
00:50:05.414 --> 00:50:11.462
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

516
00:50:11.587 --> 00:50:16.884
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

517
00:50:20.679 --> 00:50:23.182
- Well, who gets them to move?
- Guess.

518
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.604
- What if they won't go?
- I'm betting that they will.

519
00:50:29.146 --> 00:50:31.815
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey.
Look. Look.

520
00:50:32.691 --> 00:50:35.528
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

521
00:50:35.653 --> 00:50:39.365
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

522
00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:42.618
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

523
00:50:42.743 --> 00:50:45.871
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

524
00:50:46.664 --> 00:50:49.708
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

525
00:50:50.334 --> 00:50:54.046
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

526
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:56.090
Well, we're wasting time.

527
00:50:57.091 --> 00:50:58.175
I like this guy.

528
00:50:58.425 --> 00:51:01.804
- Guys, right now--
- Okay, let's run through them again.

529
00:51:01.929 --> 00:51:04.223
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

530
00:51:06.267 --> 00:51:09.228
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

531
00:51:09.353 --> 00:51:12.439
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

532
00:51:12.565 --> 00:51:14.108
Got it.

533
00:51:14.233 --> 00:51:16.402
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

534
00:51:16.527 --> 00:51:19.238
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

535
00:51:21.282 --> 00:51:23.742
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik

536
00:51:23.868 --> 00:51:25.786
They become a mated pair.

537
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:29.123
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?

538
00:51:30.082 --> 00:51:33.627
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

539
00:51:33.752 --> 00:51:35.087
Everything they know!

540
00:51:35.212 --> 00:51:37.256
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

541
00:51:37.381 --> 00:51:38.716
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

542
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:40.467
- Come on. That's--
- All right, knock it off, you two.

543
00:51:40.593 --> 00:51:43.095
Let's go.
Village life starts early.

544
00:51:45.306 --> 00:51:47.766
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

545
00:52:06.827 --> 00:52:08.120
Easy, boy.

546
00:52:08.787 --> 00:52:10.831
Pale is female.

547
00:52:13.834 --> 00:52:16.212
Okay. Easy, girl.

548
00:52:45.032 --> 00:52:48.744
That is tsaheylu.
The bond

549
00:52:50.955 --> 00:52:52.164
Feel her.

550
00:52:55.376 --> 00:52:59.421
Feel her heartbeat.
Her breath.

551
00:53:02.466 --> 00:53:04.218
Feel her strong legs.

552
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.014
You may tell her what to do.

553
00:53:09.139 --> 00:53:10.307
Inside.

554
00:53:11.308 --> 00:53:14.186
For now, say where to go.

555
00:53:17.231 --> 00:53:18.440
Forward!

556
00:53:36.083 --> 00:53:39.169
- You should go away.
- No, you'd miss me.

557
00:53:40.629 --> 00:53:42.882
I knew you could speak English.

558
00:53:45.426 --> 00:53:47.511
This alien will learn nothing,

559
00:53:48.012 --> 00:53:49.555
a rock sees more,

560
00:53:50.014 --> 00:53:51.807
look at him

561
00:54:01.275 --> 00:54:02.276
Again.

562
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:05.821
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

563
00:54:05.946 --> 00:54:08.407
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

564
00:54:08.532 --> 00:54:10.534
There's an outer row of columns.

565
00:54:10.659 --> 00:54:13.370
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

566
00:54:13.495 --> 00:54:17.082
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

567
00:54:17.958 --> 00:54:19.585
That's how they move up and down.

568
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.504
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

569
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:23.923
Roger that.

570
00:54:24.048 --> 00:54:26.675
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

571
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.595
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

572
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:37.603
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.

573
00:54:38.979 --> 00:54:43.108
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

574
00:54:43.234 --> 00:54:46.445
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

575
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.489
way up in the mountains.

576
00:54:49.281 --> 00:54:51.575
The Hallelujah Mountains?

577
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.953
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

578
00:54:54.078 --> 00:54:55.955
- Yeah.
- Yes!

579
00:54:59.458 --> 00:55:03.128
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

580
00:55:16.684 --> 00:55:18.477
We're getting close.

581
00:55:18.602 --> 00:55:21.230
Yeah, look at my instruments.

582
00:55:21.355 --> 00:55:24.275
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

583
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.610
We're VFR from here on.

584
00:55:26.735 --> 00:55:28.571
What's VFR?

585
00:55:28.696 --> 00:55:30.990
Means you gotta see where you're going.

586
00:55:31.115 --> 00:55:34.994
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

587
00:55:53.554 --> 00:55:56.140
Oh, my God.

588
00:56:07.193 --> 00:56:08.527
You should see your faces.

589
00:56:35.763 --> 00:56:38.140
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

590
00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.244
Welcome to camp.

591
00:57:02.122 --> 00:57:06.752
- So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

592
00:57:08.128 --> 00:57:10.089
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

593
00:57:10.214 --> 00:57:13.676
- Grace didn't miss a thing.
- Trudy, you'll take the top one

594
00:57:13.801 --> 00:57:16.178
She knew I was talking to the Colonel

595
00:57:16.303 --> 00:57:19.890
But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

596
00:57:20.015 --> 00:57:21.600
so she's playing nice

597
00:57:21.725 --> 00:57:26.730
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

598
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:33.696
Unit one. Beulah.
She's the least glitchy.

599
00:58:22.953 --> 00:58:24.246
Holy shit!

600
00:58:25.206 --> 00:58:27.041
Do not look in her eye.

601
00:58:35.633 --> 00:58:37.343
Ikran is not horse

602
00:58:38.511 --> 00:58:40.346
Once tsaheylu is made,

603
00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:48.521
ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life

604
00:58:58.489 --> 00:59:01.200
To become taronyu, hunter,

605
00:59:01.325 --> 00:59:04.870
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you

606
00:59:07.456 --> 00:59:09.458
- When?
- When you are ready.

607
00:59:59.884 --> 01:00:03.012
Okay. This is video log 12

608
01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:05.890
Time's 2132

609
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:10.686
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack

610
01:00:10.811 --> 01:00:13.606
No, now.
When it's fresh

611
01:00:16.317 --> 01:00:18.110
Okay, location, shack,

612
01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:21.447
and the days are starting
to blur together

613
01:00:23.574 --> 01:00:26.744
The language is a pain,
but, you know,

614
01:00:26.869 --> 01:00:29.997
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition

615
01:00:30.122 --> 01:00:31.707
- Navi.
- "Nari."

616
01:00:31.832 --> 01:00:33.918
- Nari.
- "Narrri"!

617
01:00:34.168 --> 01:00:35.377
Narrri!

618
01:00:36.337 --> 01:00:38.339
Txur ni'ul. Stronger

619
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:46.639
Neytiri calls me skxawng.
It means moron

620
01:00:48.974 --> 01:00:50.392
This is a very important part of it.

621
01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:52.603
- Norm's attitude has improved lately.
- I see you. I see you

622
01:00:52.728 --> 01:00:55.064
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

623
01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:56.815
it's "I see into you. I see you."

624
01:00:56.941 --> 01:00:59.527
It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too

625
01:00:59.652 --> 01:01:01.862
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

626
01:01:02.238 --> 01:01:05.157
I gotta run! Okay?
Let's go.

627
01:01:05.991 --> 01:01:09.537
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day

628
01:01:11.455 --> 01:01:14.542
I have to trust my body
to know what to do

629
01:01:19.713 --> 01:01:21.382
Yeah! Check it out!

630
01:01:22.216 --> 01:01:23.467
Oh, crap!

631
01:01:27.763 --> 01:01:32.601
Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,

632
01:01:32.726 --> 01:01:34.895
the tiniest scents and sounds

633
01:01:40.484 --> 01:01:45.239
She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals

634
01:01:46.073 --> 01:01:48.701
I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final

635
01:01:48.826 --> 01:01:52.454
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know

636
01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.207
You need to listen to what she says

637
01:01:55.332 --> 01:01:58.460
Try to see the forest
through her eyes

638
01:01:58.586 --> 01:02:01.130
Excuse me.
This is my video log here

639
01:02:16.562 --> 01:02:19.106
With Neytiri,
it's learn fast or die

640
01:02:20.441 --> 01:02:22.526
You gotta be kidding me.

641
01:02:51.639 --> 01:02:53.724
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace
into the village

642
01:02:53.849 --> 01:02:55.519
Look how big you are

643
01:02:55.727 --> 01:02:57.478
It's the first time
since her school was closed down

644
01:02:57.603 --> 01:02:59.396
You are so pretty

645
01:03:00.898 --> 01:03:03.692
No, you don't.
Come back here.

646
01:03:05.528 --> 01:03:06.570
Bon appe'tit

647
01:03:34.181 --> 01:03:35.766
Come on, Marine.

648
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:03.669
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

649
01:04:03.794 --> 01:04:06.005
the people have to the forest

650
01:04:06.505 --> 01:04:09.300
She talks about a network of energy

651
01:04:10.134 --> 01:04:12.678
that flows through all living things

652
01:04:13.596 --> 01:04:16.891
She says all energy is only borrowed,

653
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:20.394
and one day you have to give it back

654
01:04:43.334 --> 01:04:44.376
I see you

655
01:04:44.543 --> 01:04:45.669
brother

656
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:48.339
and thank you

657
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:54.345
Your spirit goes with Eywa

658
01:04:55.012 --> 01:04:56.722
Your body stays behind,

659
01:04:57.056 --> 01:04:59.683
to become part of The People

660
01:05:03.479 --> 01:05:04.897
A clean kill.

661
01:05:08.275 --> 01:05:09.735
You are ready.

662
01:05:35.427 --> 01:05:38.764
Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,

663
01:05:38.889 --> 01:05:41.433
is the test every young hunter
has to pass

664
01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:46.981
But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are

665
01:05:47.857 --> 01:05:49.024
Oo-rah

666
01:06:20.556 --> 01:06:21.807
Now what?

667
01:07:51.814 --> 01:07:53.732
Jakesully will go first.

668
01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.603
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside

669
01:08:31.562 --> 01:08:34.481
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

670
01:08:34.607 --> 01:08:37.401
You will have one chance, Jake.

671
01:08:37.526 --> 01:08:39.612
How will I know if he chooses me?

672
01:08:39.737 --> 01:08:41.655
He will try to kill you.

673
01:08:42.865 --> 01:08:44.241
Outstanding.

674
01:09:44.552 --> 01:09:45.928
Let's dance.

675
01:09:52.059 --> 01:09:53.894
That moron's going to die

676
01:10:17.835 --> 01:10:19.545
Don't be afraid, warrior

677
01:10:19.712 --> 01:10:21.172
Make the bond!

678
01:10:24.633 --> 01:10:25.634
No!

679
01:10:29.638 --> 01:10:30.681
Jake!

680
01:10:44.778 --> 01:10:46.322
Tsaheylu, Jake

681
01:10:48.741 --> 01:10:49.950
Tsaheylu!

682
01:11:00.127 --> 01:11:01.170
Stop!

683
01:11:09.845 --> 01:11:14.934
Yeah, that's right.
You're mine. Huh?

684
01:11:28.197 --> 01:11:31.075
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

685
01:11:32.618 --> 01:11:34.787
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?

686
01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.672
God damn!

687
01:11:49.093 --> 01:11:50.344
Oh, shit!

688
01:11:59.812 --> 01:12:01.981
Shut up and fly straight!

689
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:14.535
That's it. Bank left!

690
01:12:23.919 --> 01:12:25.671
Level out! That's it.

691
01:12:31.177 --> 01:12:32.469
Jakesully!

692
01:12:57.286 --> 01:12:58.329
Hey!

693
01:13:04.418 --> 01:13:05.669
Let's go!

694
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.017
Yeah, baby, I got this!

695
01:13:20.893 --> 01:13:22.102
Oh, shit!

696
01:13:27.483 --> 01:13:31.153
I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this

697
01:13:32.029 --> 01:13:33.113
Yeah!

698
01:13:34.114 --> 01:13:37.159
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

699
01:13:37.284 --> 01:13:42.248
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.
- Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard--

700
01:14:44.351 --> 01:14:46.312
The Tree of Souls

701
01:14:49.732 --> 01:14:51.901
It's their most sacred place.

702
01:14:52.735 --> 01:14:55.529
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

703
01:14:55.654 --> 01:14:57.698
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

704
01:14:57.823 --> 01:15:02.328
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

705
01:15:03.746 --> 01:15:05.789
I would die to get samples.

706
01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:09.210
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

707
01:15:09.335 --> 01:15:10.711
You lucky swine.

708
01:15:18.135 --> 01:15:21.847
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above

709
01:15:23.224 --> 01:15:26.185
Only problem is,
you're not the only one

710
01:15:30.105 --> 01:15:31.190
Dive!

711
01:15:53.963 --> 01:15:55.130
Go, go!

712
01:16:03.347 --> 01:16:04.640
Follow me!

713
01:16:51.145 --> 01:16:53.689
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

714
01:16:54.607 --> 01:16:57.651
It is Toruk.
Last Shadow

715
01:16:59.403 --> 01:17:02.489
Yeah, right.
It's the last one you ever see.

716
01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:10.873
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto

717
01:17:11.582 --> 01:17:13.334
Rider of Last Shadow.

718
01:17:14.752 --> 01:17:16.170
He rode this?

719
01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.423
Toruk chose him

720
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.677
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

721
01:17:23.802 --> 01:17:25.721
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

722
01:17:26.472 --> 01:17:28.349
Toruk Macto was mighty

723
01:17:30.226 --> 01:17:33.938
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

724
01:17:34.063 --> 01:17:36.357
All Na'vi people know the story.

725
01:17:43.072 --> 01:17:47.243
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world

726
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.371
and in here is the dream

727
01:18:10.933 --> 01:18:13.602
It's hard to believe
it's only been three months

728
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:19.108
I can barely remember my old life

729
01:18:22.695 --> 01:18:24.530
I don't know who I am anymore

730
01:18:43.299 --> 01:18:46.093
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

731
01:18:49.305 --> 01:18:52.224
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

732
01:18:54.476 --> 01:18:56.937
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

733
01:18:59.523 --> 01:19:02.026
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

734
01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:03.944
No, I can do this.

735
01:19:04.069 --> 01:19:05.654
You already have.

736
01:19:06.655 --> 01:19:08.824
You give me good, usable intel.

737
01:19:08.949 --> 01:19:11.118
This Tree of Souls place.

738
01:19:11.577 --> 01:19:14.955
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

739
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.790
which it will. Yeah.

740
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.710
Now it's time to come in.

741
01:19:21.212 --> 01:19:23.088
By the way,

742
01:19:23.631 --> 01:19:25.591
you gonna get your legs back.

743
01:19:26.509 --> 01:19:30.054
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

744
01:19:30.179 --> 01:19:32.598
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

745
01:19:32.723 --> 01:19:34.475
I'm a man of my word.

746
01:19:37.394 --> 01:19:39.146
I gotta finish this.

747
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.983
There's one more thing.

748
01:19:43.692 --> 01:19:48.656
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

749
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.285
If I do it, I'm one of them.

750
01:19:54.787 --> 01:19:56.539
And they'll trust me.

751
01:20:00.209 --> 01:20:03.379
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

752
01:20:17.059 --> 01:20:19.520
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

753
01:20:36.954 --> 01:20:40.916
The Na 'vi say
that every person is born twice

754
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.382
The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever

755
01:20:53.679 --> 01:20:58.184
You are now a son
of the Omaticaya

756
01:20:59.393 --> 01:21:02.646
You are part of The People

757
01:21:48.984 --> 01:21:50.945
Come. Come.

758
01:22:08.587 --> 01:22:11.298
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

759
01:22:12.925 --> 01:22:14.802
And sometimes answered.

760
01:22:22.685 --> 01:22:25.312
We call these trees
Utraya Mokri

761
01:22:26.355 --> 01:22:28.065
The Tree of Voices.

762
01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:32.236
The voices of our ancestors.

763
01:22:47.293 --> 01:22:48.836
I can hear them.

764
01:22:53.841 --> 01:22:55.384
They live, Jake,

765
01:22:57.511 --> 01:22:58.846
within Eywa.

766
01:23:03.058 --> 01:23:04.894
You are Omaticaya now.

767
01:23:05.686 --> 01:23:08.731
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

768
01:23:14.403 --> 01:23:16.447
And you may choose a woman.

769
01:23:18.616 --> 01:23:20.534
We have many fine women.

770
01:23:21.785 --> 01:23:23.746
Ninat is the best singer.

771
01:23:26.665 --> 01:23:28.542
But I don't want Ninat.

772
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.798
Peyral is a good hunter.

773
01:23:36.509 --> 01:23:38.552
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

774
01:23:40.679 --> 01:23:42.389
I've already chosen.

775
01:23:45.935 --> 01:23:48.395
But this woman must also choose me.

776
01:23:52.441 --> 01:23:54.026
She already has.

777
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.559
I am with you now, Jake.

778
01:24:28.143 --> 01:24:29.979
We are mated for life

779
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.362
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

780
01:25:08.851 --> 01:25:09.977
Ma Jake!

781
01:25:10.102 --> 01:25:11.312
Don't forget your phase integration.

782
01:25:11.437 --> 01:25:12.771
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

783
01:25:12.897 --> 01:25:14.732
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

784
01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:28.162
Jake! Jake. Wake up!
Jake, please!

785
01:25:28.829 --> 01:25:31.290
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

786
01:25:32.458 --> 01:25:34.001
Grace, I don't want--
Hey!

787
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.923
Jake!

788
01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:48.974
Okay.

789
01:26:00.069 --> 01:26:02.071
Here. I'm done.
Let's go.

790
01:26:02.196 --> 01:26:04.406
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

791
01:26:04.532 --> 01:26:06.534
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

792
01:26:10.746 --> 01:26:11.956
Jake!

793
01:26:18.754 --> 01:26:23.717
Jake! Wake up!
Jake! Wake up!

794
01:26:27.221 --> 01:26:28.514
Hey!

795
01:26:29.265 --> 01:26:31.642
Stop! Stop!

796
01:26:31.767 --> 01:26:34.520
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

797
01:26:38.774 --> 01:26:40.067
Hey, boss.

798
01:26:40.568 --> 01:26:41.735
Hey!

799
01:26:44.321 --> 01:26:45.406
- What?
- I got a native

800
01:26:45.531 --> 01:26:48.409
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

801
01:26:48.534 --> 01:26:51.620
Well, keep going.
He'll move.

802
01:26:51.745 --> 01:26:54.957
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

803
01:26:57.334 --> 01:26:59.503
Stop! Hey!

804
01:26:59.628 --> 01:27:01.922
Go! Go!

805
01:27:02.965 --> 01:27:04.341
There, see? He moved.

806
01:27:16.770 --> 01:27:18.439
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude!
Dude, no!

807
01:27:19.398 --> 01:27:20.691
I'm blind.

808
01:27:32.578 --> 01:27:34.788
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

809
01:27:36.415 --> 01:27:38.042
Here, come on!

810
01:28:03.025 --> 01:28:05.528
Freeze it right there.

811
01:28:07.154 --> 01:28:09.573
Scale up. Enhance.

812
01:28:11.242 --> 01:28:12.743
Son of a bitch.

813
01:28:14.286 --> 01:28:15.704
Unbelievable.

814
01:28:16.831 --> 01:28:18.916
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

815
01:28:25.714 --> 01:28:28.008
Tsu'tey will lead the war party

816
01:28:34.557 --> 01:28:35.766
Stop please!

817
01:28:37.393 --> 01:28:39.353
This will only make it worse

818
01:28:39.562 --> 01:28:41.188
You do not speak here!

819
01:28:42.398 --> 01:28:44.233
We will strike them in the heart

820
01:28:51.991 --> 01:28:54.118
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

821
01:28:57.288 --> 01:28:58.789
- You!
- Listen. Brother--

822
01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:07.423
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh, shit.

823
01:29:08.757 --> 01:29:10.676
Is this true?

824
01:29:12.261 --> 01:29:15.389
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

825
01:29:16.807 --> 01:29:17.933
Brother, please.

826
01:29:18.058 --> 01:29:21.812
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

827
01:29:21.937 --> 01:29:24.190
You are not my brother!

828
01:29:27.443 --> 01:29:29.153
And I am not your enemy!

829
01:29:30.821 --> 01:29:33.657
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

830
01:29:35.951 --> 01:29:37.703
Go! Go! Go!

831
01:29:40.956 --> 01:29:43.375
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

832
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:44.835
Tsu'tey!

833
01:29:51.091 --> 01:29:53.969
I am Omaticaya.
I am one of you.

834
01:29:54.803 --> 01:29:57.014
And I have the right to speak.

835
01:30:01.602 --> 01:30:03.521
I have something to say

836
01:30:05.898 --> 01:30:07.399
to all of you

837
01:30:11.403 --> 01:30:13.447
The words are like stones in my heart.

838
01:30:17.826 --> 01:30:19.745
Sir, I'm sorry.
No, no, no! Hold on!

839
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:22.081
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

840
01:30:23.290 --> 01:30:24.625
It's very dangerous!

841
01:30:27.253 --> 01:30:28.379
Grace!

842
01:30:29.672 --> 01:30:30.798
Oh, no.

843
01:30:31.048 --> 01:30:33.008
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

844
01:30:34.552 --> 01:30:36.804
Okay. Look--

845
01:30:37.888 --> 01:30:39.181
I was sent here to--

846
01:30:42.852 --> 01:30:44.228
You see?

847
01:30:44.436 --> 01:30:47.022
It is a demon in a false body

848
01:31:06.792 --> 01:31:10.171
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.

849
01:31:13.632 --> 01:31:15.759
Wheel this meat out of here.

850
01:31:17.553 --> 01:31:20.055
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

851
01:31:23.309 --> 01:31:25.060
You let me down, son.

852
01:31:27.104 --> 01:31:28.314
So, what,

853
01:31:29.857 --> 01:31:31.817
you find yourself some local tail

854
01:31:31.942 --> 01:31:35.070
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

855
01:31:35.196 --> 01:31:37.698
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

856
01:31:37.823 --> 01:31:40.284
- Parker--
- Shut your pie hole!

857
01:31:40.409 --> 01:31:44.580
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

858
01:31:44.705 --> 01:31:47.416
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.

859
01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:50.252
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

860
01:31:50.377 --> 01:31:52.796
You say you want
to keep your people alive?

861
01:31:52.922 --> 01:31:54.924
You start by listening to her.

862
01:31:55.049 --> 01:31:57.259
Those trees were sacred
to the Omaticaya

863
01:31:57.384 --> 01:31:59.136
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

864
01:31:59.261 --> 01:32:01.514
You throw a stick in the air around here,

865
01:32:01.639 --> 01:32:04.600
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

866
01:32:04.725 --> 01:32:06.018
- for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking

867
01:32:06.143 --> 01:32:10.523
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

868
01:32:10.648 --> 01:32:13.275
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

869
01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.818
Which is what, exactly?

870
01:32:15.903 --> 01:32:17.196
What we think we know

871
01:32:17.321 --> 01:32:20.658
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

872
01:32:20.783 --> 01:32:25.120
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

873
01:32:25.246 --> 01:32:29.792
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

874
01:32:29.917 --> 01:32:33.087
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

875
01:32:34.004 --> 01:32:36.215
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

876
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.676
It's more connections
than the human brain.

877
01:32:39.885 --> 01:32:42.388
Get it? It's a network.

878
01:32:42.513 --> 01:32:45.474
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

879
01:32:45.599 --> 01:32:49.061
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

880
01:32:49.186 --> 01:32:51.856
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

881
01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:53.524
Yes!

882
01:32:54.775 --> 01:32:58.863
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

883
01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:01.615
They're just goddamn trees!

884
01:33:03.367 --> 01:33:06.078
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

885
01:33:06.203 --> 01:33:10.666
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

886
01:33:10.791 --> 01:33:14.461
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

887
01:33:14.587 --> 01:33:18.841
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

888
01:33:18.966 --> 01:33:23.596
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

889
01:33:25.389 --> 01:33:27.808
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

890
01:33:27.933 --> 01:33:30.102
They're not gonna give up their home

891
01:33:31.937 --> 01:33:33.564
They're not gonna make a deal

892
01:33:34.648 --> 01:33:36.901
For what? Lite beer?

893
01:33:37.568 --> 01:33:39.028
And blue jeans?

894
01:33:42.323 --> 01:33:45.201
There's nothing that we have
that they want

895
01:33:47.119 --> 01:33:50.122
Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time

896
01:33:55.085 --> 01:33:56.962
They're never gonna leave Hometree

897
01:33:59.423 --> 01:34:05.387
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

898
01:34:05.596 --> 01:34:10.059
Jake, thanks.
I'm getting all emotional.

899
01:34:10.184 --> 01:34:12.728
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

900
01:34:19.777 --> 01:34:23.113
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

901
01:34:24.073 --> 01:34:26.534
I'll drive them out with gas first.

902
01:34:27.785 --> 01:34:29.370
It'll be humane.

903
01:34:30.996 --> 01:34:32.414
More or less.

904
01:34:34.166 --> 01:34:36.001
All right, let's pull the trigger.

905
01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:41.549
- Come on, people.
- Oh, man.

906
01:34:41.674 --> 01:34:43.342
Let's pack it up, let's go.

907
01:34:43.467 --> 01:34:45.261
This is how it's done.

908
01:34:48.305 --> 01:34:51.600
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

909
01:34:51.725 --> 01:34:55.729
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

910
01:34:55.855 --> 01:34:59.275
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

911
01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.401
My God.

912
01:35:06.699 --> 01:35:10.870
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
- Back off!

913
01:35:10.995 --> 01:35:14.665
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to--

914
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:15.833
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

915
01:35:15.958 --> 01:35:19.336
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

916
01:35:19.461 --> 01:35:21.130
All right? Look around!

917
01:35:21.255 --> 01:35:24.925
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

918
01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:26.468
- Can you guys just please--
- Yes, sir.

919
01:35:26.594 --> 01:35:29.054
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

920
01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:30.431
Are you gonna kill children?

921
01:35:30.556 --> 01:35:34.435
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

922
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.896
Just let me try to talk them out.

923
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:39.190
They trust me.

924
01:35:42.526 --> 01:35:44.904
Calibrate fast.
We're going in, right now.

925
01:35:45.029 --> 01:35:46.906
Calibrating three and four.

926
01:35:47.031 --> 01:35:49.950
- Run sequence.
- Initiating. Thirty seconds.

927
01:35:54.371 --> 01:35:56.040
Listen to me.
You've got one hour.

928
01:35:56.165 --> 01:35:58.709
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

929
01:35:58.834 --> 01:36:01.420
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

930
01:36:07.343 --> 01:36:08.552
Father!

931
01:36:08.761 --> 01:36:09.762
Mother!

932
01:36:09.929 --> 01:36:13.098
Eytukan, I have something to say

933
01:36:13.265 --> 01:36:14.517
Listen!

934
01:36:15.643 --> 01:36:17.102
Speak, Jakesully

935
01:36:18.479 --> 01:36:21.524
A great evil is upon us

936
01:36:21.899 --> 01:36:23.651
The Sky People are coming

937
01:36:23.984 --> 01:36:26.403
to destroy Hometree

938
01:36:28.906 --> 01:36:30.282
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

939
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:35.621
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

940
01:36:35.746 --> 01:36:37.665
Are you certain of this?

941
01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:45.130
Look, they sent me here
to learn your ways

942
01:36:46.382 --> 01:36:49.593
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

943
01:36:52.179 --> 01:36:55.766
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

944
01:36:59.019 --> 01:37:00.479
Yes.

945
01:37:00.604 --> 01:37:02.982
Look, at first it was just orders,

946
01:37:04.525 --> 01:37:06.819
and then everything changed.

947
01:37:06.944 --> 01:37:08.696
Okay? I fell in love.

948
01:37:09.363 --> 01:37:14.618
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

949
01:37:15.828 --> 01:37:17.246
And with you.

950
01:37:18.289 --> 01:37:20.082
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

951
01:37:20.207 --> 01:37:23.002
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now, please.

952
01:37:30.426 --> 01:37:32.803
You will never be one of The People!

953
01:37:32.928 --> 01:37:34.680
- I shouldn't have--
- We tried to stop them!

954
01:37:34.805 --> 01:37:36.765
Neytiri, please! Please.

955
01:37:41.770 --> 01:37:42.813
Bind them

956
01:37:44.607 --> 01:37:45.649
Leave now!

957
01:37:45.816 --> 01:37:49.111
You have to go.
They're coming!

958
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.169
Time on target, one mike

959
01:38:05.294 --> 01:38:07.213
Copy. We have a visual

960
01:38:07.338 --> 01:38:10.299
Roger that.
Stay on heading 030

961
01:38:10.424 --> 01:38:11.759
Roger, 030

962
01:38:25.564 --> 01:38:27.566
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

963
01:38:29.235 --> 01:38:33.030
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri, you must go now!

964
01:38:36.867 --> 01:38:39.119
Run to the forest! Run!

965
01:38:41.539 --> 01:38:42.832
Run! Run!

966
01:38:42.998 --> 01:38:46.544
Have no fear

967
01:39:03.394 --> 01:39:07.064
No! God damn it, run!

968
01:39:07.398 --> 01:39:08.774
Take the ikran,

969
01:39:08.941 --> 01:39:10.401
attack from above

970
01:39:14.738 --> 01:39:16.866
That is one big damn tree.

971
01:39:24.415 --> 01:39:28.586
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

972
01:39:30.588 --> 01:39:32.673
All right, people,
let's get this done!

973
01:39:32.798 --> 01:39:35.593
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

974
01:39:35.718 --> 01:39:37.720
Roger. CS .40's going hot.

975
01:39:38.095 --> 01:39:39.263
- Fire.
- Firing.

976
01:39:50.774 --> 01:39:52.735
Bingo.
Mighty good shooting, ace.

977
01:40:00.743 --> 01:40:02.328
Sir, they've opened fire.

978
01:40:04.288 --> 01:40:05.956
You've got to be kidding me!

979
01:40:18.552 --> 01:40:21.055
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

980
01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.806
All right, let's turn up the heat.

981
01:40:22.932 --> 01:40:25.809
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.

982
01:40:25.935 --> 01:40:26.977
Fire

983
01:40:30.314 --> 01:40:31.357
No!

984
01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.330
Get everyone to the forest

985
01:40:49.792 --> 01:40:51.961
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

986
01:40:55.714 --> 01:40:56.924
Neytiri!

987
01:41:05.641 --> 01:41:08.644
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

988
01:41:08.769 --> 01:41:09.979
My God!

989
01:41:28.581 --> 01:41:31.917
- Mo'at! No!
- If you are one of us,

990
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.795
help us.

991
01:41:42.553 --> 01:41:44.513
All call signs, switch missiles.

992
01:41:44.722 --> 01:41:47.141
Give me HE's
at the base of the west columns

993
01:41:49.101 --> 01:41:50.352
This way!

994
01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.355
Rider section, switch missiles

995
01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.357
- One's good.
- Two's rocks up

996
01:41:55.482 --> 01:41:58.027
- Three's up.
- Yeah, baby, get some!

997
01:41:58.569 --> 01:42:00.821
Charlie Oscar,
Gunrunner standing by

998
01:42:00.946 --> 01:42:02.281
- Bring it down.
- Cleared hot

999
01:42:09.413 --> 01:42:10.915
Come on, Grace, move!

1000
01:42:13.584 --> 01:42:15.169
Down! Head down!

1001
01:42:17.755 --> 01:42:19.965
Come on, come on! Down!

1002
01:42:24.762 --> 01:42:26.722
- Solid hits.
- Solid rocks on target

1003
01:42:26.847 --> 01:42:28.015
Screw this.

1004
01:42:29.266 --> 01:42:31.227
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1005
01:42:31.352 --> 01:42:33.103
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1006
01:42:42.821 --> 01:42:44.657
Repeat. Ripple fire

1007
01:43:28.284 --> 01:43:29.785
Go! Go! Go!

1008
01:44:02.902 --> 01:44:05.321
No, no, get back! Back!

1009
01:44:24.381 --> 01:44:26.926
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1010
01:45:11.971 --> 01:45:15.558
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1011
01:45:16.267 --> 01:45:17.518
Let's boogie.

1012
01:45:17.935 --> 01:45:20.312
Dragon coming left,
heading home

1013
01:45:20.813 --> 01:45:22.731
Gunrunner coming left

1014
01:45:22.857 --> 01:45:25.317
- Thunder copies.
- Rider section copies

1015
01:45:33.033 --> 01:45:34.034
Father!

1016
01:45:50.009 --> 01:45:51.177
Daughter,

1017
01:45:52.428 --> 01:45:55.639
take my bow

1018
01:45:59.643 --> 01:46:04.064
Protect The People

1019
01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:13.657
Neytiri!

1020
01:46:23.751 --> 01:46:27.463
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get away.

1021
01:46:28.172 --> 01:46:29.381
Get away!

1022
01:46:30.508 --> 01:46:32.218
Get away from here!

1023
01:46:33.719 --> 01:46:35.304
Never come back!

1024
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:54.114
Pull the plug.

1025
01:46:55.115 --> 01:46:57.701
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

1026
01:46:57.827 --> 01:46:59.745
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

1027
01:47:15.970 --> 01:47:18.514
I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace

1028
01:47:19.932 --> 01:47:23.811
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up

1029
01:47:26.647 --> 01:47:28.065
Let's go!

1030
01:47:35.948 --> 01:47:37.533
Put him down!

1031
01:47:40.911 --> 01:47:43.622
You murderer!

1032
01:48:30.294 --> 01:48:32.379
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1033
01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:33.506
Hey.

1034
01:48:34.924 --> 01:48:37.593
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1035
01:48:37.718 --> 01:48:41.013
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

1036
01:48:42.097 --> 01:48:44.600
Yeah. You know what that is.
Down.

1037
01:48:44.725 --> 01:48:47.186
- Trudy!
- All the way down.

1038
01:48:50.648 --> 01:48:51.815
Max!

1039
01:49:01.909 --> 01:49:04.411
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1040
01:49:04.995 --> 01:49:06.080
Here.

1041
01:49:18.175 --> 01:49:20.594
- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.

1042
01:49:36.193 --> 01:49:40.072
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1043
01:49:40.197 --> 01:49:41.407
Okay. Go.

1044
01:49:55.254 --> 01:49:56.380
Clear.

1045
01:49:58.382 --> 01:49:59.592
Come on, baby.

1046
01:49:59.717 --> 01:50:02.469
Colonel? Sir?
I got a situation here.

1047
01:50:06.098 --> 01:50:09.101
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1048
01:50:12.188 --> 01:50:13.439
Three!

1049
01:50:16.317 --> 01:50:17.484
Come on!

1050
01:50:19.528 --> 01:50:20.821
Mask on!

1051
01:50:23.407 --> 01:50:25.201
Gas, gas, gas!

1052
01:50:26.869 --> 01:50:28.871
I'm taking fire!
Let's go!

1053
01:50:31.373 --> 01:50:34.502
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1054
01:50:35.503 --> 01:50:37.296
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go!

1055
01:50:49.975 --> 01:50:51.268
Colonel!

1056
01:50:58.067 --> 01:51:01.529
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

1057
01:51:04.782 --> 01:51:07.409
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?

1058
01:51:07.535 --> 01:51:08.994
Oh, yeah, baby!

1059
01:51:09.119 --> 01:51:10.955
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

1060
01:51:11.872 --> 01:51:14.166
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1061
01:51:14.458 --> 01:51:16.210
- Grace is hit!
- What?

1062
01:51:17.419 --> 01:51:18.963
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

1063
01:51:19.088 --> 01:51:22.550
- Keep the pressure on, Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1064
01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:27.096
- Hang on, Grace.
- Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1065
01:51:30.474 --> 01:51:32.893
- You're good to go.
- Take it up!

1066
01:51:34.103 --> 01:51:35.896
Hold on.
I'm pulling pitch

1067
01:51:40.359 --> 01:51:41.777
You're clear!

1068
01:51:49.743 --> 01:51:52.454
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1069
01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:53.956
Copy that

1070
01:52:00.963 --> 01:52:04.258
- Norm, you all good up there?
- Yep! Still here

1071
01:52:06.135 --> 01:52:10.764
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

1072
01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:12.933
It's strongest
at the Tree of Souls, right?

1073
01:52:13.058 --> 01:52:14.476
Yeah

1074
01:52:14.602 --> 01:52:16.520
Good. 'Cause that's
where we're going.

1075
01:52:25.404 --> 01:52:26.530
Ouch.

1076
01:52:29.992 --> 01:52:31.368
You big baby.

1077
01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:34.163
We're moving.

1078
01:52:34.747 --> 01:52:36.790
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1079
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:39.877
I'm a scientist, remember?

1080
01:52:40.836 --> 01:52:43.255
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1081
01:52:44.131 --> 01:52:46.008
The People can help you.

1082
01:52:46.509 --> 01:52:47.801
I know it.

1083
01:52:49.803 --> 01:52:51.639
Why would they help us?

1084
01:53:07.696 --> 01:53:10.783
The People say Eywa will provide

1085
01:53:12.743 --> 01:53:15.412
With no home, no hope,

1086
01:53:16.539 --> 01:53:18.666
there was only one place they could go

1087
01:53:33.097 --> 01:53:34.265
Link's running.

1088
01:53:35.015 --> 01:53:37.977
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.

1089
01:53:39.061 --> 01:53:43.691
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place

1090
01:53:44.733 --> 01:53:46.068
I gotta try.

1091
01:53:48.863 --> 01:53:50.156
Launching.

1092
01:54:11.677 --> 01:54:12.887
Outcast

1093
01:54:13.679 --> 01:54:14.889
Betrayer

1094
01:54:16.015 --> 01:54:17.141
Alien

1095
01:54:18.726 --> 01:54:21.395
I was in the place
the eye does not see

1096
01:54:32.615 --> 01:54:36.452
I needed their help,
and they needed mine

1097
01:54:37.411 --> 01:54:39.371
But to ever face them again,

1098
01:54:39.497 --> 01:54:41.916
I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level

1099
01:54:50.508 --> 01:54:53.802
Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move

1100
01:54:56.597 --> 01:54:58.933
There's something we gotta do.

1101
01:54:59.058 --> 01:55:00.726
You're not gonna like it.

1102
01:55:10.778 --> 01:55:14.573
The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky

1103
01:55:14.698 --> 01:55:16.283
Nothing attacks him

1104
01:55:16.826 --> 01:55:18.118
Easy, boy.

1105
01:55:18.619 --> 01:55:20.412
So why would he ever look up?

1106
01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:23.165
But that was just a theory

1107
01:56:33.903 --> 01:56:35.488
Toruk Macto?

1108
01:57:15.319 --> 01:57:16.779
I see you.

1109
01:57:19.907 --> 01:57:21.200
I see you.

1110
01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:31.210
I was afraid, Jake.

1111
01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:34.129
For my people.

1112
01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:38.801
I'm not anymore.

1113
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:50.563
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo,

1114
01:57:51.313 --> 01:57:53.190
I stand before you

1115
01:57:54.316 --> 01:57:57.361
ready to serve
the Omaticaya people

1116
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:04.243
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior

1117
01:58:05.452 --> 01:58:07.580
I can't do this without you.

1118
01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:16.046
Toruk Macto,

1119
01:58:23.929 --> 01:58:25.639
I will fly with you.

1120
01:58:28.976 --> 01:58:30.686
My friend is dying.

1121
01:58:33.105 --> 01:58:34.607
Grace is dying.

1122
01:58:36.650 --> 01:58:38.486
I beg the help of Eywa.

1123
01:58:50.414 --> 01:58:52.374
Look where we are, Grace.

1124
01:58:59.131 --> 01:59:01.467
I need to take some samples.

1125
01:59:24.949 --> 01:59:28.994
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1126
01:59:30.246 --> 01:59:31.664
in this body.

1127
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:35.876
Is that possible?

1128
01:59:36.001 --> 01:59:40.464
She must pass through
the eye of Eywa and return.

1129
01:59:41.757 --> 01:59:43.259
But, Jakesully,

1130
01:59:44.301 --> 01:59:45.886
she is very weak.

1131
01:59:47.388 --> 01:59:50.182
Hang on, Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.

1132
01:59:53.477 --> 01:59:56.021
Hear us please, All Mother

1133
01:59:56.647 --> 01:59:58.858
Eywa, help her

1134
01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:01.777
Take this spirit into you

1135
02:00:05.447 --> 02:00:07.533
and breathe her back to us

1136
02:00:11.453 --> 02:00:13.038
Let her walk among us

1137
02:00:15.624 --> 02:00:17.501
as one of The People

1138
02:00:46.447 --> 02:00:47.490
Jake.

1139
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:51.076
Grace.

1140
02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:54.914
I'm with her, Jake.

1141
02:00:56.957 --> 02:00:58.292
She's real!

1142
02:01:01.378 --> 02:01:04.507
Grace? Grace, please.
Grace!

1143
02:01:05.716 --> 02:01:07.301
What's happening?

1144
02:01:08.302 --> 02:01:09.929
What's happening?

1145
02:01:14.308 --> 02:01:15.434
Grace!

1146
02:01:16.185 --> 02:01:17.311
Grace!

1147
02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:21.023
What's happening?

1148
02:01:27.321 --> 02:01:28.697
Did it work?

1149
02:01:34.411 --> 02:01:38.457
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1150
02:01:40.167 --> 02:01:41.877
She is with Eywa now.

1151
02:02:15.703 --> 02:02:18.330
With your permission,
I will speak now.

1152
02:02:20.749 --> 02:02:23.169
You would honor me by translating.

1153
02:02:30.301 --> 02:02:32.469
The Sky People have sent us a message,

1154
02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:38.267
that they can take
whatever they want,

1155
02:02:40.102 --> 02:02:41.854
and no one can stop them.

1156
02:02:45.483 --> 02:02:47.234
Well, we will send them a message.

1157
02:02:49.904 --> 02:02:52.198
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

1158
02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:57.870
You tell the other clans to come.

1159
02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.501
You tell them
Toruk Macto calls to them

1160
02:03:05.753 --> 02:03:08.506
And you fly now with me!

1161
02:03:09.590 --> 02:03:12.051
My brothers! Sisters!

1162
02:03:13.177 --> 02:03:15.221
And we will show the Sky People

1163
02:03:16.263 --> 02:03:18.098
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1164
02:03:19.642 --> 02:03:21.060
and that this,

1165
02:03:21.810 --> 02:03:22.811
this is our land!

1166
02:04:36.218 --> 02:04:37.678
We rode out to the four winds

1167
02:04:40.472 --> 02:04:42.850
To the horse clans of the plain

1168
02:04:45.853 --> 02:04:46.854
Back to the stars!

1169
02:04:46.979 --> 02:04:49.148
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea

1170
02:04:49.273 --> 02:04:50.483
For our children's children!

1171
02:04:50.608 --> 02:04:53.152
When Toruk Macto called them,
they came

1172
02:05:34.568 --> 02:05:37.029
Everyone on this base,
every one of you,

1173
02:05:37.154 --> 02:05:38.948
is fighting for survival.

1174
02:05:39.073 --> 02:05:40.533
That's a fact!

1175
02:05:41.408 --> 02:05:45.120
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

1176
02:05:46.247 --> 02:05:50.084
Now, these orbital images tell me

1177
02:05:50.543 --> 02:05:53.712
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1178
02:05:53.838 --> 02:05:56.340
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1179
02:05:56.924 --> 02:05:58.884
And more are pouring in.

1180
02:06:01.387 --> 02:06:04.765
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1181
02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:07.184
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

1182
02:06:07.309 --> 02:06:09.478
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1183
02:06:11.105 --> 02:06:14.692
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1184
02:06:14.817 --> 02:06:17.153
We will fight terror with terror.

1185
02:06:21.490 --> 02:06:25.619
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1186
02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:28.080
is protected by their--

1187
02:06:28.205 --> 02:06:29.540
Their deity.

1188
02:06:30.875 --> 02:06:32.918
And when we destroy it,

1189
02:06:33.043 --> 02:06:35.337
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1190
02:06:35.462 --> 02:06:38.924
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks
of this place ever again.

1191
02:06:39.049 --> 02:06:41.719
And that, too, is a fact.

1192
02:06:42.469 --> 02:06:44.180
Yeah! Yeah.

1193
02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:58.611
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber

1194
02:06:58.736 --> 02:07:00.946
They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives

1195
02:07:01.071 --> 02:07:03.949
It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign

1196
02:07:04.074 --> 02:07:05.951
Fricking daisy cutters!

1197
02:07:07.495 --> 02:07:10.289
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him

1198
02:07:10.414 --> 02:07:12.458
- When?
- 0600 tomorrow

1199
02:07:12.583 --> 02:07:14.418
- Max! Max!
- I gotta go

1200
02:07:16.337 --> 02:07:17.796
We're screwed!

1201
02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:21.467
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

1202
02:07:21.592 --> 02:07:23.761
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1203
02:07:25.262 --> 02:07:28.599
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1204
02:07:31.644 --> 02:07:33.646
I have 15 clans out there.

1205
02:07:34.355 --> 02:07:36.440
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1206
02:07:37.983 --> 02:07:42.404
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1207
02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:47.493
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

1208
02:07:48.035 --> 02:07:49.495
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1209
02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:53.833
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

1210
02:07:55.751 --> 02:07:59.171
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1211
02:07:59.296 --> 02:08:00.464
Yeah, I know.

1212
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:03.050
If they get to the Tree of Souls,
it's over.

1213
02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:06.345
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1214
02:08:07.179 --> 02:08:09.139
It'll destroy them.

1215
02:08:09.265 --> 02:08:11.642
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1216
02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:29.702
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1217
02:08:32.163 --> 02:08:36.876
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

1218
02:08:39.461 --> 02:08:43.841
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

1219
02:08:45.134 --> 02:08:47.219
See the world we come from.

1220
02:08:48.345 --> 02:08:50.222
There's no green there.

1221
02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:53.601
They killed their Mother.

1222
02:08:54.435 --> 02:08:56.896
And they're gonna do the same here.

1223
02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:01.108
More Sky People are gonna come.

1224
02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:04.236
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1225
02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:07.281
Unless we stop them.

1226
02:09:09.909 --> 02:09:12.953
Look, you chose me for something.

1227
02:09:14.455 --> 02:09:16.290
I will stand and fight.

1228
02:09:17.374 --> 02:09:18.918
You know I will.

1229
02:09:21.462 --> 02:09:23.672
But I need a little help here.

1230
02:09:29.845 --> 02:09:32.848
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1231
02:09:34.683 --> 02:09:38.103
She protects only the balance of life.

1232
02:09:49.949 --> 02:09:51.617
It was worth a try.

1233
02:10:22.356 --> 02:10:24.316
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

1234
02:10:24.441 --> 02:10:27.736
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1235
02:10:39.874 --> 02:10:43.210
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex

1236
02:10:43.627 --> 02:10:47.173
- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode

1237
02:11:22.124 --> 02:11:23.959
This is Papa Dragon.

1238
02:11:24.084 --> 02:11:27.129
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1239
02:11:34.678 --> 02:11:38.390
- Suit Team, go.
- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1240
02:11:48.984 --> 02:11:50.569
Move, move, move!

1241
02:11:56.242 --> 02:11:57.993
Bravo 1-1, move left

1242
02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:01.956
Bravo 1-1 moving left.
Watch flank

1243
02:12:04.333 --> 02:12:07.878
- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that

1244
02:12:08.003 --> 02:12:10.339
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing

1245
02:12:10.464 --> 02:12:11.757
Copy that. Over

1246
02:12:11.882 --> 02:12:16.512
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

1247
02:12:17.137 --> 02:12:20.432
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target

1248
02:12:20.558 --> 02:12:22.935
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle

1249
02:12:28.065 --> 02:12:30.568
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1250
02:12:31.569 --> 02:12:34.155
Gun crews,
keep your head on a swivel

1251
02:12:34.321 --> 02:12:37.199
Make no mistake, people,
they're out there

1252
02:12:38.826 --> 02:12:42.037
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

1253
02:12:42.163 --> 02:12:44.331
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1254
02:12:44.498 --> 02:12:46.959
- Copy. Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1255
02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:49.962
Roll it to the ramp!
Let's go!

1256
02:12:52.256 --> 02:12:53.299
Hold!

1257
02:13:01.348 --> 02:13:03.350
Charlie 2-1, got big movement

1258
02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:04.852
- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up

1259
02:13:04.977 --> 02:13:09.106
- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1, hold position

1260
02:13:15.237 --> 02:13:18.157
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

1261
02:13:18.282 --> 02:13:20.784
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
- Firing line!

1262
02:13:21.202 --> 02:13:23.871
Targets closing.
Range, 400 meters

1263
02:13:24.622 --> 02:13:27.333
- Can't you clean it up?
- No, sir. It's the Flux.

1264
02:13:55.653 --> 02:13:58.280
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1265
02:14:40.072 --> 02:14:42.783
All aircraft, weapons free!
Weapons free!

1266
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:45.119
Break right. Come around.

1267
02:14:48.706 --> 02:14:50.166
Light them up!

1268
02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:00.009
Break formation,
engage all hostiles.

1269
02:15:07.308 --> 02:15:09.143
Yeah! Get some!

1270
02:15:48.182 --> 02:15:49.975
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1271
02:16:00.861 --> 02:16:02.613
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1272
02:16:03.322 --> 02:16:05.991
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1273
02:16:06.116 --> 02:16:07.117
Copy. Get out of there.

1274
02:16:12.206 --> 02:16:13.582
That's him. Get after him!

1275
02:16:30.558 --> 02:16:32.017
Take him out!

1276
02:16:40.359 --> 02:16:41.777
Light her up!

1277
02:16:50.828 --> 02:16:52.204
Right there!

1278
02:16:52.371 --> 02:16:54.582
You're not the only one
with a gun, bitch.

1279
02:16:54.874 --> 02:16:56.500
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

1280
02:16:56.625 --> 02:16:57.626
Arming all pods.

1281
02:17:03.382 --> 02:17:04.425
That's it!

1282
02:17:35.122 --> 02:17:36.207
Seze!

1283
02:18:40.187 --> 02:18:42.356
Rogue One is hit.
I'm going in

1284
02:18:43.274 --> 02:18:44.650
Sorry, Jake.

1285
02:18:53.534 --> 02:18:54.577
Fire.

1286
02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:15.181
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1287
02:19:18.058 --> 02:19:19.685
Rogue One, you copy?

1288
02:19:21.729 --> 02:19:22.855
Trudy!

1289
02:19:33.782 --> 02:19:35.034
Time to target, two minutes.

1290
02:19:35.409 --> 02:19:37.786
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1291
02:19:37.912 --> 02:19:40.039
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1292
02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:49.715
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!

1293
02:19:51.175 --> 02:19:52.343
Ma Jake!

1294
02:19:54.303 --> 02:19:55.429
I read you.

1295
02:20:04.605 --> 02:20:06.565
- Neytiri!
- Seze's dead

1296
02:20:07.191 --> 02:20:09.652
They are very close.
They are many.

1297
02:20:11.111 --> 02:20:12.571
Do not attack.

1298
02:20:13.197 --> 02:20:15.115
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1299
02:20:17.743 --> 02:20:18.994
Do not attack!

1300
02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:22.498
Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!

1301
02:20:30.631 --> 02:20:31.799
Neytiri!

1302
02:20:33.926 --> 02:20:35.803
I got movement, I got movement

1303
02:20:35.928 --> 02:20:38.138
Hold position.
Something's coming.

1304
02:20:38.264 --> 02:20:40.015
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over

1305
02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:42.268
- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation

1306
02:20:42.393 --> 02:20:44.061
- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks

1307
02:20:49.233 --> 02:20:50.693
Hundred meters and closing fast

1308
02:21:07.293 --> 02:21:09.253
We gotta get out of here!

1309
02:21:10.796 --> 02:21:12.464
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Move! Move! Move!

1310
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:14.967
Fall back!
On the run! On the run!

1311
02:21:22.141 --> 02:21:24.810
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1312
02:21:31.692 --> 02:21:33.444
Eywa has heard you!

1313
02:21:44.038 --> 02:21:45.414
Come on!

1314
02:21:57.718 --> 02:21:59.553
Fall back! Move! Move!

1315
02:22:24.078 --> 02:22:26.664
Sir! All escorts are down
or falling back.

1316
02:22:26.789 --> 02:22:30.876
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1317
02:22:31.001 --> 02:22:33.838
- Press to target.
- Copy. Pressing to target

1318
02:22:33.963 --> 02:22:35.923
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1319
02:22:55.776 --> 02:22:58.195
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1320
02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:00.990
Drop! Drop! Drop!
Go, go, go, go!

1321
02:23:34.773 --> 02:23:35.900
Brace!

1322
02:23:52.958 --> 02:23:54.251
It's Sully.

1323
02:24:08.015 --> 02:24:10.267
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

1324
02:26:47.466 --> 02:26:49.301
Come on. Come to papa.

1325
02:27:16.829 --> 02:27:18.581
Give it up, Quaritch!

1326
02:27:21.667 --> 02:27:23.127
It's all over.

1327
02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:26.839
Nothing's over while I'm breathing

1328
02:27:26.964 --> 02:27:29.216
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1329
02:28:25.397 --> 02:28:26.565
Come on!

1330
02:28:42.498 --> 02:28:46.544
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1331
02:28:51.257 --> 02:28:53.384
You think you're one of them?

1332
02:28:54.677 --> 02:28:56.262
Time to wake up.

1333
02:30:40.533 --> 02:30:41.534
Jake?

1334
02:30:55.297 --> 02:30:56.340
Jake.

1335
02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:15.734
Jake.

1336
02:31:31.834 --> 02:31:33.794
Jake! Ma Jake!

1337
02:32:15.461 --> 02:32:16.754
I see you.

1338
02:32:22.468 --> 02:32:23.761
I see you.

1339
02:32:35.397 --> 02:32:38.192
The aliens went back
to their dying world

1340
02:32:40.402 --> 02:32:43.280
Only a few were chosen to stay

1341
02:32:55.501 --> 02:32:57.962
The time of great sorrow was ending

1342
02:33:00.089 --> 02:33:02.466
Toruk Macto was no longer needed

1343
02:33:15.020 --> 02:33:18.899
Well, I guess this is
my last video log

1344
02:33:20.776 --> 02:33:24.530
'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm-- 

1345
02:33:25.614 --> 02:33:28.409
I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place

1346
02:33:32.037 --> 02:33:34.165
Well, I guess I'd better go

1347
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:39.795
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party

1348
02:33:43.174 --> 02:33:45.551
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all

1349
02:33:48.137 --> 02:33:50.389
This is Jake Sully signing off

1350
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.992
When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,

1351
00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:44.995
with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,

1352
00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.290
I started having these dreams of flying

1353
00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:51.126
I was free

1354
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.967
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up

1355
00:01:14.358 --> 00:01:16.277
In cryo, you don't dream at all

1356
00:01:17.236 --> 00:01:19.321
It doesn't feel like six years

1357
00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:21.824
More like a fifth of teguila
and an ass-kicking

1358
00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:30.207
Tommy was the scientist, not me

1359
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.502
He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space

1360
00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:34.879
to find the answers

1361
00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:37.381
Are we there yet?

1362
00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:39.258
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

1363
00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:41.385
We're there.

1364
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.928
It's about your brother

1365
00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:49.393
So, a week before
Tommy's gonna ship out,

1366
00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:53.188
a guy with a gun ends his journey
for the paper in his wallet

1367
00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:58.360
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

1368
00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.363
You will be hungry.
You will be weak.

1369
00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.033
If you feel nausea,
please use the sacks--

1370
00:02:04.158 --> 00:02:06.118
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist

1371
00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:09.413
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's gonna regret

1372
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.304
Up ahead was Pandora

1373
00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:30.684
You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there

1374
00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:44.114
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

1375
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.034
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

1376
00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.664
And since your genome is identical to his,
you could step into his shoes,

1377
00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:54.583
so to speak.

1378
00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:03.551
It'd be a fresh start
on a new world

1379
00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:12.893
And the pay is good

1380
00:03:14.103 --> 00:03:15.479
Very good.

1381
00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:40.796
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

1382
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.214
Remember, people,
you lose that mask,

1383
00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:45.968
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

1384
00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:49.388
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

1385
00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:53.851
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

1386
00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:55.728
Crossing outer marker.
Mine is in sight.

1387
00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:35.267
One life ends,

1388
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:37.478
another begins

1389
00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:47.238
Harnesses off!
Get your packs!

1390
00:04:47.363 --> 00:04:50.783
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

1391
00:04:50.908 --> 00:04:54.870
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

1392
00:04:54.995 --> 00:04:57.540
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

1393
00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:07.883
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

1394
00:05:12.763 --> 00:05:14.765
There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine

1395
00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:18.811
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude

1396
00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:22.940
I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass

1397
00:05:27.903 --> 00:05:30.781
They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,

1398
00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:33.576
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy

1399
00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:38.414
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

1400
00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.207
Well, well, ladies.

1401
00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:43.502
Look at all this fresh meat!

1402
00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:53.429
Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

1403
00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:55.014
fighting for freedom

1404
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.272
Look out, hot rod!

1405
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.609
But out here they're just hired guns,

1406
00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:09.528
taking the money,
working for the company

1407
00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:10.988
Check this out, man.

1408
00:06:11.655 --> 00:06:13.115
Meals on wheels.

1409
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.328
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

1410
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.246
I got two guys free
in about 20 minutes!

1411
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:20.873
Got it! Need them!

1412
00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:32.426
You're not in Kansas anymore

1413
00:06:34.887 --> 00:06:38.766
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

1414
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:42.603
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

1415
00:06:44.897 --> 00:06:46.482
If there is a hell,

1416
00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:51.862
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

1417
00:06:52.738 --> 00:06:54.865
Out there, beyond that fence,

1418
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.286
every living thing that crawls,
flies or squats in the mud

1419
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:02.540
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

1420
00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:09.213
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

1421
00:07:09.338 --> 00:07:11.632
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

1422
00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:14.510
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

1423
00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:18.931
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

1424
00:07:19.598 --> 00:07:21.392
They are very hard to kill.

1425
00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:26.855
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

1426
00:07:28.816 --> 00:07:30.568
I will not succeed.

1427
00:07:32.778 --> 00:07:34.154
Not with all of you.

1428
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:37.283
If you wish to survive,

1429
00:07:37.408 --> 00:07:40.244
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

1430
00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:43.247
You've got to obey the rules.

1431
00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:46.041
Pandora rules.

1432
00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.003
Rule number one--

1433
00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:50.754
There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief

1434
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.548
to put your mind at ease

1435
00:07:54.925 --> 00:08:00.431
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

1436
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.350
Wow! You look just like him.

1437
00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:07.187
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

1438
00:08:07.313 --> 00:08:09.273
...into the bio-lab.

1439
00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:14.528
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

1440
00:08:14.653 --> 00:08:15.863
- Hi.
- Hey.

1441
00:08:15.988 --> 00:08:17.531
Link-- Here's the link room right here.

1442
00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:19.909
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

1443
00:08:21.744 --> 00:08:23.787
Me and Norm are here to drive

1444
00:08:23.913 --> 00:08:27.041
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars

1445
00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:32.129
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives

1446
00:08:32.254 --> 00:08:34.173
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

1447
00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:36.634
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

1448
00:08:38.677 --> 00:08:40.512
Damn! They got big.

1449
00:08:40.638 --> 00:08:43.140
Yeah, they fully mature
on the flight out.

1450
00:08:43.265 --> 00:08:45.559
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

1451
00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:47.519
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

1452
00:08:47.645 --> 00:08:49.480
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

1453
00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:51.482
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

1454
00:08:52.024 --> 00:08:53.359
There's yours.

1455
00:08:55.069 --> 00:08:56.654
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

1456
00:08:56.779 --> 00:08:59.615
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

1457
00:09:23.556 --> 00:09:25.015
Looks like him.

1458
00:09:26.308 --> 00:09:28.102
No, it looks like you.

1459
00:09:29.228 --> 00:09:31.146
This is your avatar now, Jake.

1460
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:38.779
And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,

1461
00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:41.657
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

1462
00:09:43.075 --> 00:09:44.493
or something

1463
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.249
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

1464
00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.168
which is insanely expensive

1465
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:57.381
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

1466
00:09:57.506 --> 00:09:59.633
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

1467
00:09:59.758 --> 00:10:01.760
You know, what we see, what we feel.

1468
00:10:01.886 --> 00:10:04.555
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.

1469
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.057
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

1470
00:10:07.182 --> 00:10:09.935
All right. Whatever.

1471
00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:13.564
So--

1472
00:10:14.648 --> 00:10:16.066
Well, here I am,

1473
00:10:17.776 --> 00:10:19.236
doing science.

1474
00:10:20.446 --> 00:10:21.989
They're coming out!

1475
00:10:22.114 --> 00:10:24.575
Attention.
Drivers coming out of link

1476
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.250
Oh, God.

1477
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:36.879
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

1478
00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:43.302
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

1479
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.848
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.

1480
00:10:47.973 --> 00:10:50.434
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

1481
00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:53.270
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

1482
00:10:53.395 --> 00:10:55.606
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

1483
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.983
Here she is,
Cinderella back from the ball.

1484
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.779
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

1485
00:11:03.572 --> 00:11:07.243
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

1486
00:11:08.327 --> 00:11:10.496
May the All Mother

1487
00:11:10.663 --> 00:11:12.665
smile upon our first meeting

1488
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:15.960
Not bad.
You sound a little formal

1489
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.338
I studied for five years

1490
00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:21.507
but there is much to learn

1491
00:11:21.757 --> 00:11:25.219
- Grace? This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.

1492
00:11:25.803 --> 00:11:29.807
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

1493
00:11:29.932 --> 00:11:33.519
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

1494
00:11:33.644 --> 00:11:35.020
He's dead.

1495
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:38.065
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

1496
00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:42.486
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.

1497
00:11:43.904 --> 00:11:47.074
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

1498
00:11:47.199 --> 00:11:49.493
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

1499
00:11:49.618 --> 00:11:50.828
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

1500
00:11:50.953 --> 00:11:53.497
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!

1501
00:11:53.622 --> 00:11:54.999
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

1502
00:11:55.124 --> 00:11:57.960
He has no business sticking his nose
in my department.

1503
00:11:59.044 --> 00:12:02.798
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

1504
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.019
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

1505
00:12:15.144 --> 00:12:17.938
Hover taxi, Delta runway.
Squawk ident.

1506
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:25.070
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

1507
00:12:25.196 --> 00:12:27.239
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

1508
00:12:27.364 --> 00:12:30.242
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

1509
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.333
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

1510
00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:40.377
but now I see that
you're intentionally screwing me.

1511
00:12:40.502 --> 00:12:44.006
Grace, you know,
I enjoy our little talks.

1512
00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:51.847
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

1513
00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:53.599
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

1514
00:12:53.724 --> 00:12:55.184
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

1515
00:12:55.309 --> 00:12:57.269
How is this in any way lucky?

1516
00:12:57.394 --> 00:12:59.104
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

1517
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.107
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

1518
00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:04.109
A Marine we can use.

1519
00:13:04.235 --> 00:13:06.070
I'm assigning him to your team
as security escort.

1520
00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:09.615
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

1521
00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.575
Look, look, you're supposed
to be winning the hearts

1522
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.701
and the minds of the natives.

1523
00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:14.620
Isn't that the whole point
of your little puppet show?

1524
00:13:14.745 --> 00:13:16.205
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

1525
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.957
then they'll start trusting us.

1526
00:13:18.082 --> 00:13:20.042
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

1527
00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:22.127
but after, what, how many years?

1528
00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:23.754
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

1529
00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:27.091
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

1530
00:13:27.216 --> 00:13:29.301
Right. Come here.

1531
00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:32.137
I can't-- I can't--

1532
00:13:35.391 --> 00:13:38.310
This is why we're here.
Unobtanium.

1533
00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:41.480
Because this little gray rock
sells for 20 million a kilo.

1534
00:13:41.605 --> 00:13:44.817
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

1535
00:13:44.942 --> 00:13:46.777
It's what pays for your science.

1536
00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:51.282
Now, those savages are threatening
our whole operation,

1537
00:13:51.407 --> 00:13:52.616
we're on the brink of war,

1538
00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:55.911
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

1539
00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:59.498
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

1540
00:14:10.426 --> 00:14:12.928
So, how much link time have you logged?

1541
00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:16.640
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.

1542
00:14:16.765 --> 00:14:21.061
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

1543
00:14:21.186 --> 00:14:23.814
Zip. But I read a manual.

1544
00:14:24.815 --> 00:14:26.817
Tell me you're joking.

1545
00:14:28.193 --> 00:14:29.528
This is cool.

1546
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.405
Let's go.

1547
00:14:35.367 --> 00:14:37.036
Don't. I got this.

1548
00:14:41.457 --> 00:14:44.001
So you just figured
you'd come out here,

1549
00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:46.712
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

1550
00:14:46.837 --> 00:14:50.549
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

1551
00:14:50.674 --> 00:14:52.927
What was going through your head?

1552
00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:55.846
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

1553
00:14:56.972 --> 00:14:59.225
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

1554
00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:03.979
Keep your arms in,
hands in, head down.

1555
00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:08.901
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

1556
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.487
That shouldn't be hard for you.

1557
00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:13.405
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white--

1558
00:15:13.572 --> 00:15:14.907
Initiate link.

1559
00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:18.202
Run sequence unit three. Go.

1560
00:15:18.327 --> 00:15:19.745
Launching.

1561
00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:26.627
I have the first congruency.

1562
00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:40.558
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
- Go figure.

1563
00:15:40.683 --> 00:15:42.601
Phase-lock 40%.

1564
00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:48.148
All right. Going in.

1565
00:15:48.816 --> 00:15:50.359
I'm going in in four.

1566
00:15:53.445 --> 00:15:56.031
Phase-lock 99%.
Link is stable.

1567
00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:16.760
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

1568
00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:18.429
Pupillary reflex is good

1569
00:16:21.223 --> 00:16:24.226
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

1570
00:16:24.977 --> 00:16:26.312
Hey, guys.

1571
00:16:27.229 --> 00:16:28.939
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

1572
00:16:29.064 --> 00:16:30.399
Good!

1573
00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:31.984
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

1574
00:16:32.109 --> 00:16:34.153
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

1575
00:16:34.278 --> 00:16:35.654
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

1576
00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.323
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

1577
00:16:37.448 --> 00:16:39.533
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,

1578
00:16:39.658 --> 00:16:40.910
- that's fine.
- Okay, good. Just take it

1579
00:16:41.035 --> 00:16:43.996
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

1580
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:47.541
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!

1581
00:16:47.666 --> 00:16:49.376
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

1582
00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:54.006
Distal motor control is good.
Good, Jake.

1583
00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:56.717
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

1584
00:16:58.093 --> 00:16:59.345
That's great, Jake.
Hold on, now.

1585
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.680
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

1586
00:17:01.805 --> 00:17:04.308
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

1587
00:17:04.433 --> 00:17:06.477
- so take it easy.
- Wait.

1588
00:17:06.602 --> 00:17:08.020
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

1589
00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:10.522
Jake! Listen to me.
Jake!

1590
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.858
- I need you to sit down. Jake!
- It's okay.

1591
00:17:12.983 --> 00:17:14.693
- Buddy, listen to me.
- It's all good. I got this.

1592
00:17:14.818 --> 00:17:18.447
- Jake, you need to sit down right now.
- Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

1593
00:17:18.572 --> 00:17:20.658
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

1594
00:17:20.783 --> 00:17:23.536
You need time to adjust to the avatar--
Whoa! Jake!

1595
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:25.871
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

1596
00:17:25.996 --> 00:17:30.042
Sedate! Sedate him!
A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

1597
00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:32.419
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

1598
00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:33.546
By the numbers

1599
00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:35.047
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me

1600
00:17:35.172 --> 00:17:36.715
You're not used to your avatar body.

1601
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.467
- This is dangerous.
- This is great

1602
00:17:38.592 --> 00:17:41.804
- Jake? Jake, listen to me.
- Come on. They're gonna put you out

1603
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.059
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

1604
00:17:47.184 --> 00:17:48.727
God damn it!
Bring them home!

1605
00:17:48.852 --> 00:17:51.438
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

1606
00:17:53.232 --> 00:17:57.069
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

1607
00:17:57.194 --> 00:17:58.737
I don't even have to play defense on it.

1608
00:17:58.863 --> 00:18:00.281
Hey, guys. Hey.

1609
00:18:00.406 --> 00:18:02.658
- It's okay, I'll get him.
- Jake, you have to come back!

1610
00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:04.535
Jake! Jake!
Excuse me.

1611
00:18:07.121 --> 00:18:08.706
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

1612
00:18:08.831 --> 00:18:10.249
Come on!

1613
00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:14.211
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

1614
00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:26.140
- Jeez! Sorry.
- Watch it!

1615
00:18:48.454 --> 00:18:49.955
Hey, Marine!

1616
00:18:50.831 --> 00:18:52.166
Damn.

1617
00:18:54.251 --> 00:18:57.379
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

1618
00:18:58.672 --> 00:19:00.132
Think fast.

1619
00:19:01.008 --> 00:19:03.177
Motor controI's looking good.

1620
00:19:13.062 --> 00:19:17.358
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

1621
00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:19.568
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

1622
00:19:19.693 --> 00:19:21.111
Hey, hey, hey!

1623
00:19:21.654 --> 00:19:23.864
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

1624
00:19:23.989 --> 00:19:25.407
That's kind of freaky.

1625
00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:27.952
Come on. Scat.

1626
00:19:28.911 --> 00:19:30.329
Good night.

1627
00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:35.167
Lights out!
See you at dinner, kiddies.

1628
00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:00.234
Welcome back.

1629
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.536
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1630
00:20:12.288 --> 00:20:17.501
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

1631
00:20:18.127 --> 00:20:19.753
Hold on a second.

1632
00:20:20.296 --> 00:20:23.173
Hey, Wainfleet!
Get it done!

1633
00:20:23.632 --> 00:20:27.761
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

1634
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.431
Vine strike's still loose.

1635
00:20:30.556 --> 00:20:32.683
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

1636
00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:34.101
Watch it!

1637
00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.438
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

1638
00:20:37.563 --> 00:20:39.189
Or the biggest.

1639
00:20:39.315 --> 00:20:42.109
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

1640
00:20:42.234 --> 00:20:43.986
I thought you'd never ask.

1641
00:20:45.362 --> 00:20:48.490
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

1642
00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:01.629
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

1643
00:21:01.754 --> 00:21:04.298
This low gravity'll make you soft.

1644
00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:07.301
You get soft,

1645
00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:13.807
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

1646
00:21:14.934 --> 00:21:17.478
I pulled your record, Corporal.

1647
00:21:17.603 --> 00:21:19.980
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

1648
00:21:21.982 --> 00:21:24.235
Nothing like this here, though.

1649
00:21:26.529 --> 00:21:29.865
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

1650
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.825
I figured it's just another hellhole.

1651
00:21:31.951 --> 00:21:34.328
I was First Recon myself.

1652
00:21:34.453 --> 00:21:37.665
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

1653
00:21:38.624 --> 00:21:41.502
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

1654
00:21:41.627 --> 00:21:43.045
I come out here?

1655
00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:47.132
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail louie?

1656
00:21:47.258 --> 00:21:51.762
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

1657
00:21:52.513 --> 00:21:57.518
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

1658
00:21:57.643 --> 00:22:00.479
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

1659
00:22:02.523 --> 00:22:08.362
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

1660
00:22:08.487 --> 00:22:15.411
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

1661
00:22:15.536 --> 00:22:17.162
- Clear!
- Clear!

1662
00:22:22.334 --> 00:22:27.464
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

1663
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.216
Give me the goose bumps.

1664
00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:32.720
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

1665
00:22:32.845 --> 00:22:34.513
right on the ground.

1666
00:22:35.806 --> 00:22:37.725
Right in the hostiles' camp.

1667
00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:43.856
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

1668
00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:45.608
I want you to gain their trust.

1669
00:22:45.733 --> 00:22:47.443
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

1670
00:22:47.568 --> 00:22:50.070
or hammer them hard if they won't.

1671
00:22:51.572 --> 00:22:53.782
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

1672
00:22:53.908 --> 00:22:57.995
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

1673
00:22:59.538 --> 00:23:01.081
but you report to me.

1674
00:23:02.541 --> 00:23:04.293
Can you do that for me, son?

1675
00:23:05.878 --> 00:23:07.254
Hell, yeah, sir.

1676
00:23:08.172 --> 00:23:09.924
Well, all right, then.

1677
00:23:20.976 --> 00:23:23.854
Son, I take care of my own.

1678
00:23:23.979 --> 00:23:25.064
You get me what I need,

1679
00:23:25.189 --> 00:23:28.400
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

1680
00:23:29.318 --> 00:23:30.778
Your real legs.

1681
00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:35.533
That sounds real good, sir.

1682
00:23:42.206 --> 00:23:44.917
- Link's ready!
- Phase-lock 40%.

1683
00:23:45.543 --> 00:23:48.629
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

1684
00:23:48.754 --> 00:23:52.258
I have five congruencies.
Phase-lock 90%.

1685
00:23:52.383 --> 00:23:53.634
Link three ready.

1686
00:23:54.343 --> 00:23:55.970
All right, I'm going in.

1687
00:25:05.998 --> 00:25:08.375
Shut it down.
We're gonna stay a while.

1688
00:25:11.837 --> 00:25:15.591
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

1689
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.223
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

1690
00:25:24.725 --> 00:25:26.352
You the man, Doc.

1691
00:26:02.972 --> 00:26:06.016
Prolemuris.
They're not aggressive.

1692
00:26:08.644 --> 00:26:12.106
Relax, Marine.
You're making me nervous.

1693
00:26:17.695 --> 00:26:20.281
So, how will they know we're here?

1694
00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:23.033
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

1695
00:26:25.494 --> 00:26:27.454
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

1696
00:26:29.874 --> 00:26:33.460
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

1697
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.049
Wow! It's that fast?

1698
00:26:41.343 --> 00:26:43.387
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1699
00:26:43.512 --> 00:26:47.266
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

1700
00:26:47.391 --> 00:26:50.978
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

1701
00:26:51.103 --> 00:26:52.730
Okay. Sample.

1702
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.986
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

1703
00:26:59.695 --> 00:27:03.616
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

1704
00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:05.826
Right.

1705
00:27:33.687 --> 00:27:35.523
So, here I go.

1706
00:28:01.006 --> 00:28:04.843
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

1707
00:28:08.597 --> 00:28:10.182
It's already pissed off.

1708
00:28:10.432 --> 00:28:13.269
Jake, that armor's too thick.
Trust me.

1709
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:23.237
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

1710
00:28:23.904 --> 00:28:25.614
So, what do I do,
dance with it?

1711
00:28:26.115 --> 00:28:29.159
Just hold your ground.

1712
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.635
Yeah? Come on!
What you got?

1713
00:28:47.803 --> 00:28:49.763
Oh, yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

1714
00:28:50.806 --> 00:28:53.142
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, bitch.

1715
00:28:54.727 --> 00:28:57.271
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

1716
00:28:57.396 --> 00:29:00.274
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

1717
00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:03.360
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

1718
00:29:06.488 --> 00:29:07.615
Oh, shit.

1719
00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.879
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

1720
00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:25.341
Run! Definitely run!

1721
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:13.152
I'm gonna have to call it, guys

1722
00:33:13.277 --> 00:33:16.113
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

1723
00:33:17.907 --> 00:33:21.118
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have
to hang on till morning

1724
00:33:21.243 --> 00:33:22.786
He won't make it till morning.

1725
00:35:15.733 --> 00:35:17.651
I don't have all goddamn night.

1726
00:35:18.527 --> 00:35:20.613
Come on! Come on!

1727
00:36:34.603 --> 00:36:36.188
Hey, wait. Don't!

1728
00:36:39.775 --> 00:36:40.818
Great.

1729
00:37:38.334 --> 00:37:41.837
Look, I know you probably
don't understand this,

1730
00:37:47.968 --> 00:37:49.136
but thank you.

1731
00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.726
Thank you.

1732
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.190
That was pretty impressive.

1733
00:38:03.984 --> 00:38:06.862
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was--

1734
00:38:10.491 --> 00:38:13.536
Hey, wait a second.
Hey, where you going?

1735
00:38:14.578 --> 00:38:15.996
Wait up!

1736
00:38:16.789 --> 00:38:18.541
Just-- Hey, slow down.

1737
00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:21.669
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

1738
00:38:22.836 --> 00:38:25.839
- Damn!
- Don't thank.

1739
00:38:26.757 --> 00:38:29.093
You don't thank for this.

1740
00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:34.598
This is sad.
Very sad only.

1741
00:38:35.558 --> 00:38:37.643
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

1742
00:38:38.519 --> 00:38:40.271
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

1743
00:38:43.816 --> 00:38:46.944
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

1744
00:38:47.862 --> 00:38:49.864
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

1745
00:38:49.989 --> 00:38:51.615
Your fault!

1746
00:38:52.116 --> 00:38:54.827
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

1747
00:38:54.952 --> 00:38:58.581
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

1748
00:38:58.706 --> 00:39:00.124
Easy.

1749
00:39:02.418 --> 00:39:04.795
Fine. Fine.

1750
00:39:06.046 --> 00:39:08.090
If you love your little forest friends,

1751
00:39:09.717 --> 00:39:11.510
why not let them just kill my ass?

1752
00:39:12.553 --> 00:39:14.263
What's the thinking?

1753
00:39:15.097 --> 00:39:17.766
- Why save you?
- Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

1754
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:24.190
You have a strong heart.

1755
00:39:26.317 --> 00:39:27.526
No fear.

1756
00:39:32.072 --> 00:39:34.909
But stupid!
Ignorant like a child.

1757
00:39:41.332 --> 00:39:43.751
Well, if I'm like a child, then--

1758
00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.587
Look, maybe you should teach me.

1759
00:39:46.712 --> 00:39:48.923
Sky People cannot learn.
You do not see.

1760
00:39:49.048 --> 00:39:50.841
Well, then teach me how to see.

1761
00:39:50.966 --> 00:39:53.427
- No one can teach you to see.
- Whoa.

1762
00:39:54.803 --> 00:39:57.223
Look, come on,
can't we talk?

1763
00:39:58.182 --> 00:40:02.061
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

1764
00:40:06.899 --> 00:40:08.609
You're like a baby.

1765
00:40:14.823 --> 00:40:16.408
I need your help.

1766
00:40:17.493 --> 00:40:19.328
You should not be here.

1767
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:23.123
- Okay, take me with you.
- No! Go back.

1768
00:40:25.834 --> 00:40:26.835
No.

1769
00:40:28.337 --> 00:40:29.547
Go back.

1770
00:40:51.193 --> 00:40:52.194
No!

1771
00:41:14.049 --> 00:41:15.175
What--

1772
00:41:19.013 --> 00:41:20.472
What are they?

1773
00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:23.809
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

1774
00:41:24.894 --> 00:41:26.520
Very pure spirits.

1775
00:41:50.628 --> 00:41:52.546
What was that all about?

1776
00:41:54.715 --> 00:41:55.758
Come.

1777
00:41:57.259 --> 00:41:58.302
Come!

1778
00:42:00.554 --> 00:42:02.223
Where are we going?

1779
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:13.526
Come.

1780
00:42:18.197 --> 00:42:19.907
What's your name?

1781
00:42:20.032 --> 00:42:21.075
Shit!

1782
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.643
Okay.

1783
00:42:50.396 --> 00:42:53.190
Calm people, calm

1784
00:42:58.946 --> 00:43:01.740
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

1785
00:43:04.243 --> 00:43:07.079
These demons are forbidden here

1786
00:43:07.955 --> 00:43:10.207
There has been a sign

1787
00:43:10.332 --> 00:43:12.626
This is a matter for the Tsahik

1788
00:43:17.464 --> 00:43:18.424
Bring him

1789
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:21.635
What's going on?

1790
00:43:24.013 --> 00:43:25.055
Wait.

1791
00:43:28.058 --> 00:43:29.643
What's happening?

1792
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:31.562
Hey!

1793
00:44:41.674 --> 00:44:42.925
Father

1794
00:44:43.842 --> 00:44:45.594
I see you

1795
00:44:57.398 --> 00:44:58.774
This creature--

1796
00:44:59.108 --> 00:45:02.152
why do you bring him here?

1797
00:45:03.612 --> 00:45:04.989
I was going to kill him

1798
00:45:05.322 --> 00:45:07.116
but there was a sing from Eywa

1799
00:45:07.324 --> 00:45:09.285
I have said

1800
00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.579
no dreamwalker will come here

1801
00:45:11.704 --> 00:45:13.038
What's he saying?

1802
00:45:13.539 --> 00:45:15.958
His alien smell fills my nose

1803
00:45:16.083 --> 00:45:17.084
Hey, what's he saying?

1804
00:45:17.209 --> 00:45:19.962
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

1805
00:45:21.463 --> 00:45:24.383
Your father.
It's nice to meet you, sir.

1806
00:45:28.012 --> 00:45:29.430
Step back!

1807
00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.768
I will look at this alien

1808
00:45:34.894 --> 00:45:36.437
That is Mother.

1809
00:45:36.562 --> 00:45:40.482
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

1810
00:45:41.358 --> 00:45:42.693
Who's Eywa?

1811
00:45:49.575 --> 00:45:51.285
What are you called?

1812
00:45:52.286 --> 00:45:53.621
Jake Sully.

1813
00:46:03.547 --> 00:46:06.300
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.

1814
00:46:07.718 --> 00:46:10.638
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

1815
00:46:10.763 --> 00:46:14.099
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

1816
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:17.895
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

1817
00:46:19.188 --> 00:46:21.815
Just ask Dr. Augustine.
I'm no scientist.

1818
00:46:21.941 --> 00:46:23.317
What are you?

1819
00:46:25.611 --> 00:46:28.822
I was a Marine. A--

1820
00:46:29.698 --> 00:46:32.326
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

1821
00:46:32.785 --> 00:46:33.994
A warrior!

1822
00:46:34.119 --> 00:46:35.579
I could kill him easily!

1823
00:46:35.579 --> 00:46:36.830
No!

1824
00:46:37.373 --> 00:46:41.502
This is the first warrior dreamwalker

1825
00:46:41.627 --> 00:46:43.462
we have seen

1826
00:46:43.587 --> 00:46:46.340
We need to learn more about him

1827
00:46:48.842 --> 00:46:50.678
My Daughter--

1828
00:46:50.803 --> 00:46:55.057
you will teach him our way,

1829
00:46:55.182 --> 00:46:58.561
to speak and walk as we do

1830
00:46:58.686 --> 00:47:02.231
Why me? That's not fair

1831
00:47:03.107 --> 00:47:07.194
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

1832
00:47:07.319 --> 00:47:10.865
Learn well, Jakesully.

1833
00:47:11.699 --> 00:47:15.494
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

1834
00:47:34.221 --> 00:47:35.681
Good evening.

1835
00:47:38.726 --> 00:47:40.477
Please don't get up.

1836
00:47:42.396 --> 00:47:43.689
Excuse me.

1837
00:47:46.025 --> 00:47:47.151
Sorry.

1838
00:47:50.279 --> 00:47:51.989
Hey, how you doing?

1839
00:48:35.699 --> 00:48:37.952
- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha

1840
00:48:38.077 --> 00:48:41.080
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake. Jake!

1841
00:48:42.957 --> 00:48:45.960
Come on back, kid. Come on.
That's it.

1842
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:50.297
There you go.
There you go, there you go.

1843
00:48:50.422 --> 00:48:52.758
You're okay. You're okay.

1844
00:48:52.883 --> 00:48:55.761
Damn!
You were dug in like a tick.

1845
00:48:58.889 --> 00:49:01.433
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.

1846
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.271
And you are not gonna believe
where I am.

1847
00:49:06.313 --> 00:49:09.275
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

1848
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.404
disappearing into the brush
with this angry thanator coming after him.

1849
00:49:13.529 --> 00:49:16.448
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

1850
00:49:16.574 --> 00:49:18.868
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

1851
00:49:18.993 --> 00:49:22.246
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

1852
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:25.082
"Jarhead clan"?

1853
00:49:26.709 --> 00:49:29.712
- And it worked?
- Hey, I'm practically family.

1854
00:49:30.838 --> 00:49:34.258
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

1855
00:49:34.383 --> 00:49:35.926
That's called taking the initiative, son.

1856
00:49:36.051 --> 00:49:38.512
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look, Sully. Sully.

1857
00:49:38.637 --> 00:49:42.016
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

1858
00:49:42.808 --> 00:49:48.564
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

1859
00:49:48.689 --> 00:49:50.482
But no, no, no, they like mud.

1860
00:49:50.608 --> 00:49:54.486
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're--

1861
00:49:55.112 --> 00:49:58.157
Hey, can you-- Can somebody just--
Sector 12.

1862
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.078
Okay, go, go, go, stop.
Stop--

1863
00:50:03.204 --> 00:50:05.289
Rich, stop!
That's-- Jesus!

1864
00:50:05.414 --> 00:50:11.462
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

1865
00:50:11.587 --> 00:50:16.884
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

1866
00:50:20.679 --> 00:50:23.182
- Well, who gets them to move?
- Guess.

1867
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.604
- What if they won't go?
- I'm betting that they will.

1868
00:50:29.146 --> 00:50:31.815
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey.
Look. Look.

1869
00:50:32.691 --> 00:50:35.528
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

1870
00:50:35.653 --> 00:50:39.365
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

1871
00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:42.618
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

1872
00:50:42.743 --> 00:50:45.871
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

1873
00:50:46.664 --> 00:50:49.708
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

1874
00:50:50.334 --> 00:50:54.046
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

1875
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:56.090
Well, we're wasting time.

1876
00:50:57.091 --> 00:50:58.175
I like this guy.

1877
00:50:58.425 --> 00:51:01.804
- Guys, right now--
- Okay, let's run through them again.

1878
00:51:01.929 --> 00:51:04.223
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

1879
00:51:06.267 --> 00:51:09.228
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

1880
00:51:09.353 --> 00:51:12.439
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

1881
00:51:12.565 --> 00:51:14.108
Got it.

1882
00:51:14.233 --> 00:51:16.402
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

1883
00:51:16.527 --> 00:51:19.238
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

1884
00:51:21.282 --> 00:51:23.742
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik

1885
00:51:23.868 --> 00:51:25.786
They become a mated pair.

1886
00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:29.123
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?

1887
00:51:30.082 --> 00:51:33.627
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

1888
00:51:33.752 --> 00:51:35.087
Everything they know!

1889
00:51:35.212 --> 00:51:37.256
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

1890
00:51:37.381 --> 00:51:38.716
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

1891
00:51:38.841 --> 00:51:40.467
- Come on. That's--
- All right, knock it off, you two.

1892
00:51:40.593 --> 00:51:43.095
Let's go.
Village life starts early.

1893
00:51:45.306 --> 00:51:47.766
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

1894
00:52:06.827 --> 00:52:08.120
Easy, boy.

1895
00:52:08.787 --> 00:52:10.831
Pale is female.

1896
00:52:13.834 --> 00:52:16.212
Okay. Easy, girl.

1897
00:52:45.032 --> 00:52:48.744
That is tsaheylu.
The bond

1898
00:52:50.955 --> 00:52:52.164
Feel her.

1899
00:52:55.376 --> 00:52:59.421
Feel her heartbeat.
Her breath.

1900
00:53:02.466 --> 00:53:04.218
Feel her strong legs.

1901
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.014
You may tell her what to do.

1902
00:53:09.139 --> 00:53:10.307
Inside.

1903
00:53:11.308 --> 00:53:14.186
For now, say where to go.

1904
00:53:17.231 --> 00:53:18.440
Forward!

1905
00:53:36.083 --> 00:53:39.169
- You should go away.
- No, you'd miss me.

1906
00:53:40.629 --> 00:53:42.882
I knew you could speak English.

1907
00:53:45.426 --> 00:53:47.511
This alien will learn nothing,

1908
00:53:48.012 --> 00:53:49.555
a rock sees more,

1909
00:53:50.014 --> 00:53:51.807
look at him

1910
00:54:01.275 --> 00:54:02.276
Again.

1911
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:05.821
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

1912
00:54:05.946 --> 00:54:08.407
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

1913
00:54:08.532 --> 00:54:10.534
There's an outer row of columns.

1914
00:54:10.659 --> 00:54:13.370
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

1915
00:54:13.495 --> 00:54:17.082
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

1916
00:54:17.958 --> 00:54:19.585
That's how they move up and down.

1917
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.504
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

1918
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:23.923
Roger that.

1919
00:54:24.048 --> 00:54:26.675
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

1920
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.595
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

1921
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:37.603
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.

1922
00:54:38.979 --> 00:54:43.108
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

1923
00:54:43.234 --> 00:54:46.445
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

1924
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.489
way up in the mountains.

1925
00:54:49.281 --> 00:54:51.575
The Hallelujah Mountains?

1926
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.953
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

1927
00:54:54.078 --> 00:54:55.955
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1928
00:54:59.458 --> 00:55:03.128
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

1929
00:55:16.684 --> 00:55:18.477
We're getting close.

1930
00:55:18.602 --> 00:55:21.230
Yeah, look at my instruments.

1931
00:55:21.355 --> 00:55:24.275
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

1932
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.610
We're VFR from here on.

1933
00:55:26.735 --> 00:55:28.571
What's VFR?

1934
00:55:28.696 --> 00:55:30.990
Means you gotta see where you're going.

1935
00:55:31.115 --> 00:55:34.994
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

1936
00:55:53.554 --> 00:55:56.140
Oh, my God.

1937
00:56:07.193 --> 00:56:08.527
You should see your faces.

1938
00:56:35.763 --> 00:56:38.140
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

1939
00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.244
Welcome to camp.

1940
00:57:02.122 --> 00:57:06.752
- So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

1941
00:57:08.128 --> 00:57:10.089
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

1942
00:57:10.214 --> 00:57:13.676
- Grace didn't miss a thing.
- Trudy, you'll take the top one

1943
00:57:13.801 --> 00:57:16.178
She knew I was talking to the Colonel

1944
00:57:16.303 --> 00:57:19.890
But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

1945
00:57:20.015 --> 00:57:21.600
so she's playing nice

1946
00:57:21.725 --> 00:57:26.730
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

1947
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:33.696
Unit one. Beulah.
She's the least glitchy.

1948
00:58:22.953 --> 00:58:24.246
Holy shit!

1949
00:58:25.206 --> 00:58:27.041
Do not look in her eye.

1950
00:58:35.633 --> 00:58:37.343
Ikran is not horse

1951
00:58:38.511 --> 00:58:40.346
Once tsaheylu is made,

1952
00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:48.521
ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life

1953
00:58:58.489 --> 00:59:01.200
To become taronyu, hunter,

1954
00:59:01.325 --> 00:59:04.870
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you

1955
00:59:07.456 --> 00:59:09.458
- When?
- When you are ready.

1956
00:59:59.884 --> 01:00:03.012
Okay. This is video log 12

1957
01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:05.890
Time's 2132

1958
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:10.686
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack

1959
01:00:10.811 --> 01:00:13.606
No, now.
When it's fresh

1960
01:00:16.317 --> 01:00:18.110
Okay, location, shack,

1961
01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:21.447
and the days are starting
to blur together

1962
01:00:23.574 --> 01:00:26.744
The language is a pain,
but, you know,

1963
01:00:26.869 --> 01:00:29.997
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition

1964
01:00:30.122 --> 01:00:31.707
- Navi.
- "Nari."

1965
01:00:31.832 --> 01:00:33.918
- Nari.
- "Narrri"!

1966
01:00:34.168 --> 01:00:35.377
Narrri!

1967
01:00:36.337 --> 01:00:38.339
Txur ni'ul. Stronger

1968
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:46.639
Neytiri calls me skxawng.
It means moron

1969
01:00:48.974 --> 01:00:50.392
This is a very important part of it.

1970
01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:52.603
- Norm's attitude has improved lately.
- I see you. I see you

1971
01:00:52.728 --> 01:00:55.064
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

1972
01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:56.815
it's "I see into you. I see you."

1973
01:00:56.941 --> 01:00:59.527
It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too

1974
01:00:59.652 --> 01:01:01.862
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

1975
01:01:02.238 --> 01:01:05.157
I gotta run! Okay?
Let's go.

1976
01:01:05.991 --> 01:01:09.537
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day

1977
01:01:11.455 --> 01:01:14.542
I have to trust my body
to know what to do

1978
01:01:19.713 --> 01:01:21.382
Yeah! Check it out!

1979
01:01:22.216 --> 01:01:23.467
Oh, crap!

1980
01:01:27.763 --> 01:01:32.601
Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,

1981
01:01:32.726 --> 01:01:34.895
the tiniest scents and sounds

1982
01:01:40.484 --> 01:01:45.239
She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals

1983
01:01:46.073 --> 01:01:48.701
I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final

1984
01:01:48.826 --> 01:01:52.454
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know

1985
01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.207
You need to listen to what she says

1986
01:01:55.332 --> 01:01:58.460
Try to see the forest
through her eyes

1987
01:01:58.586 --> 01:02:01.130
Excuse me.
This is my video log here

1988
01:02:16.562 --> 01:02:19.106
With Neytiri,
it's learn fast or die

1989
01:02:20.441 --> 01:02:22.526
You gotta be kidding me.

1990
01:02:51.639 --> 01:02:53.724
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace
into the village

1991
01:02:53.849 --> 01:02:55.519
Look how big you are

1992
01:02:55.727 --> 01:02:57.478
It's the first time
since her school was closed down

1993
01:02:57.603 --> 01:02:59.396
You are so pretty

1994
01:03:00.898 --> 01:03:03.692
No, you don't.
Come back here.

1995
01:03:05.528 --> 01:03:06.570
Bon appe'tit

1996
01:03:34.181 --> 01:03:35.766
Come on, Marine.

1997
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:03.669
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

1998
01:04:03.794 --> 01:04:06.005
the people have to the forest

1999
01:04:06.505 --> 01:04:09.300
She talks about a network of energy

2000
01:04:10.134 --> 01:04:12.678
that flows through all living things

2001
01:04:13.596 --> 01:04:16.891
She says all energy is only borrowed,

2002
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:20.394
and one day you have to give it back

2003
01:04:43.334 --> 01:04:44.376
I see you

2004
01:04:44.543 --> 01:04:45.669
brother

2005
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:48.339
and thank you

2006
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:54.345
Your spirit goes with Eywa

2007
01:04:55.012 --> 01:04:56.722
Your body stays behind,

2008
01:04:57.056 --> 01:04:59.683
to become part of The People

2009
01:05:03.479 --> 01:05:04.897
A clean kill.

2010
01:05:08.275 --> 01:05:09.735
You are ready.

2011
01:05:35.427 --> 01:05:38.764
Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,

2012
01:05:38.889 --> 01:05:41.433
is the test every young hunter
has to pass

2013
01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:46.981
But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are

2014
01:05:47.857 --> 01:05:49.024
Oo-rah

2015
01:06:20.556 --> 01:06:21.807
Now what?

2016
01:07:51.814 --> 01:07:53.732
Jakesully will go first.

2017
01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.603
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside

2018
01:08:31.562 --> 01:08:34.481
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

2019
01:08:34.607 --> 01:08:37.401
You will have one chance, Jake.

2020
01:08:37.526 --> 01:08:39.612
How will I know if he chooses me?

2021
01:08:39.737 --> 01:08:41.655
He will try to kill you.

2022
01:08:42.865 --> 01:08:44.241
Outstanding.

2023
01:09:44.552 --> 01:09:45.928
Let's dance.

2024
01:09:52.059 --> 01:09:53.894
That moron's going to die

2025
01:10:17.835 --> 01:10:19.545
Don't be afraid, warrior

2026
01:10:19.712 --> 01:10:21.172
Make the bond!

2027
01:10:24.633 --> 01:10:25.634
No!

2028
01:10:29.638 --> 01:10:30.681
Jake!

2029
01:10:44.778 --> 01:10:46.322
Tsaheylu, Jake

2030
01:10:48.741 --> 01:10:49.950
Tsaheylu!

2031
01:11:00.127 --> 01:11:01.170
Stop!

2032
01:11:09.845 --> 01:11:14.934
Yeah, that's right.
You're mine. Huh?

2033
01:11:28.197 --> 01:11:31.075
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

2034
01:11:32.618 --> 01:11:34.787
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?

2035
01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.672
God damn!

2036
01:11:49.093 --> 01:11:50.344
Oh, shit!

2037
01:11:59.812 --> 01:12:01.981
Shut up and fly straight!

2038
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:14.535
That's it. Bank left!

2039
01:12:23.919 --> 01:12:25.671
Level out! That's it.

2040
01:12:31.177 --> 01:12:32.469
Jakesully!

2041
01:12:57.286 --> 01:12:58.329
Hey!

2042
01:13:04.418 --> 01:13:05.669
Let's go!

2043
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.017
Yeah, baby, I got this!

2044
01:13:20.893 --> 01:13:22.102
Oh, shit!

2045
01:13:27.483 --> 01:13:31.153
I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this

2046
01:13:32.029 --> 01:13:33.113
Yeah!

2047
01:13:34.114 --> 01:13:37.159
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

2048
01:13:37.284 --> 01:13:42.248
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.
- Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard--

2049
01:14:44.351 --> 01:14:46.312
The Tree of Souls

2050
01:14:49.732 --> 01:14:51.901
It's their most sacred place.

2051
01:14:52.735 --> 01:14:55.529
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

2052
01:14:55.654 --> 01:14:57.698
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

2053
01:14:57.823 --> 01:15:02.328
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

2054
01:15:03.746 --> 01:15:05.789
I would die to get samples.

2055
01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:09.210
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

2056
01:15:09.335 --> 01:15:10.711
You lucky swine.

2057
01:15:18.135 --> 01:15:21.847
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above

2058
01:15:23.224 --> 01:15:26.185
Only problem is,
you're not the only one

2059
01:15:30.105 --> 01:15:31.190
Dive!

2060
01:15:53.963 --> 01:15:55.130
Go, go!

2061
01:16:03.347 --> 01:16:04.640
Follow me!

2062
01:16:51.145 --> 01:16:53.689
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

2063
01:16:54.607 --> 01:16:57.651
It is Toruk.
Last Shadow

2064
01:16:59.403 --> 01:17:02.489
Yeah, right.
It's the last one you ever see.

2065
01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:10.873
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto

2066
01:17:11.582 --> 01:17:13.334
Rider of Last Shadow.

2067
01:17:14.752 --> 01:17:16.170
He rode this?

2068
01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.423
Toruk chose him

2069
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.677
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

2070
01:17:23.802 --> 01:17:25.721
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

2071
01:17:26.472 --> 01:17:28.349
Toruk Macto was mighty

2072
01:17:30.226 --> 01:17:33.938
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

2073
01:17:34.063 --> 01:17:36.357
All Na'vi people know the story.

2074
01:17:43.072 --> 01:17:47.243
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world

2075
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.371
and in here is the dream

2076
01:18:10.933 --> 01:18:13.602
It's hard to believe
it's only been three months

2077
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:19.108
I can barely remember my old life

2078
01:18:22.695 --> 01:18:24.530
I don't know who I am anymore

2079
01:18:43.299 --> 01:18:46.093
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

2080
01:18:49.305 --> 01:18:52.224
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

2081
01:18:54.476 --> 01:18:56.937
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

2082
01:18:59.523 --> 01:19:02.026
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

2083
01:19:02.151 --> 01:19:03.944
No, I can do this.

2084
01:19:04.069 --> 01:19:05.654
You already have.

2085
01:19:06.655 --> 01:19:08.824
You give me good, usable intel.

2086
01:19:08.949 --> 01:19:11.118
This Tree of Souls place.

2087
01:19:11.577 --> 01:19:14.955
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

2088
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.790
which it will. Yeah.

2089
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.710
Now it's time to come in.

2090
01:19:21.212 --> 01:19:23.088
By the way,

2091
01:19:23.631 --> 01:19:25.591
you gonna get your legs back.

2092
01:19:26.509 --> 01:19:30.054
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

2093
01:19:30.179 --> 01:19:32.598
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

2094
01:19:32.723 --> 01:19:34.475
I'm a man of my word.

2095
01:19:37.394 --> 01:19:39.146
I gotta finish this.

2096
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.983
There's one more thing.

2097
01:19:43.692 --> 01:19:48.656
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

2098
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.285
If I do it, I'm one of them.

2099
01:19:54.787 --> 01:19:56.539
And they'll trust me.

2100
01:20:00.209 --> 01:20:03.379
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

2101
01:20:17.059 --> 01:20:19.520
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

2102
01:20:36.954 --> 01:20:40.916
The Na 'vi say
that every person is born twice

2103
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.382
The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever

2104
01:20:53.679 --> 01:20:58.184
You are now a son
of the Omaticaya

2105
01:20:59.393 --> 01:21:02.646
You are part of The People

2106
01:21:48.984 --> 01:21:50.945
Come. Come.

2107
01:22:08.587 --> 01:22:11.298
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

2108
01:22:12.925 --> 01:22:14.802
And sometimes answered.

2109
01:22:22.685 --> 01:22:25.312
We call these trees
Utraya Mokri

2110
01:22:26.355 --> 01:22:28.065
The Tree of Voices.

2111
01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:32.236
The voices of our ancestors.

2112
01:22:47.293 --> 01:22:48.836
I can hear them.

2113
01:22:53.841 --> 01:22:55.384
They live, Jake,

2114
01:22:57.511 --> 01:22:58.846
within Eywa.

2115
01:23:03.058 --> 01:23:04.894
You are Omaticaya now.

2116
01:23:05.686 --> 01:23:08.731
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

2117
01:23:14.403 --> 01:23:16.447
And you may choose a woman.

2118
01:23:18.616 --> 01:23:20.534
We have many fine women.

2119
01:23:21.785 --> 01:23:23.746
Ninat is the best singer.

2120
01:23:26.665 --> 01:23:28.542
But I don't want Ninat.

2121
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.798
Peyral is a good hunter.

2122
01:23:36.509 --> 01:23:38.552
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

2123
01:23:40.679 --> 01:23:42.389
I've already chosen.

2124
01:23:45.935 --> 01:23:48.395
But this woman must also choose me.

2125
01:23:52.441 --> 01:23:54.026
She already has.

2126
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.559
I am with you now, Jake.

2127
01:24:28.143 --> 01:24:29.979
We are mated for life

2128
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.362
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

2129
01:25:08.851 --> 01:25:09.977
Ma Jake!

2130
01:25:10.102 --> 01:25:11.312
Don't forget your phase integration.

2131
01:25:11.437 --> 01:25:12.771
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

2132
01:25:12.897 --> 01:25:14.732
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

2133
01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:28.162
Jake! Jake. Wake up!
Jake, please!

2134
01:25:28.829 --> 01:25:31.290
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

2135
01:25:32.458 --> 01:25:34.001
Grace, I don't want--
Hey!

2136
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.923
Jake!

2137
01:25:47.890 --> 01:25:48.974
Okay.

2138
01:26:00.069 --> 01:26:02.071
Here. I'm done.
Let's go.

2139
01:26:02.196 --> 01:26:04.406
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

2140
01:26:04.532 --> 01:26:06.534
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

2141
01:26:10.746 --> 01:26:11.956
Jake!

2142
01:26:18.754 --> 01:26:23.717
Jake! Wake up!
Jake! Wake up!

2143
01:26:27.221 --> 01:26:28.514
Hey!

2144
01:26:29.265 --> 01:26:31.642
Stop! Stop!

2145
01:26:31.767 --> 01:26:34.520
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

2146
01:26:38.774 --> 01:26:40.067
Hey, boss.

2147
01:26:40.568 --> 01:26:41.735
Hey!

2148
01:26:44.321 --> 01:26:45.406
- What?
- I got a native

2149
01:26:45.531 --> 01:26:48.409
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

2150
01:26:48.534 --> 01:26:51.620
Well, keep going.
He'll move.

2151
01:26:51.745 --> 01:26:54.957
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

2152
01:26:57.334 --> 01:26:59.503
Stop! Hey!

2153
01:26:59.628 --> 01:27:01.922
Go! Go!

2154
01:27:02.965 --> 01:27:04.341
There, see? He moved.

2155
01:27:16.770 --> 01:27:18.439
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude!
Dude, no!

2156
01:27:19.398 --> 01:27:20.691
I'm blind.

2157
01:27:32.578 --> 01:27:34.788
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

2158
01:27:36.415 --> 01:27:38.042
Here, come on!

2159
01:28:03.025 --> 01:28:05.528
Freeze it right there.

2160
01:28:07.154 --> 01:28:09.573
Scale up. Enhance.

2161
01:28:11.242 --> 01:28:12.743
Son of a bitch.

2162
01:28:14.286 --> 01:28:15.704
Unbelievable.

2163
01:28:16.831 --> 01:28:18.916
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

2164
01:28:25.714 --> 01:28:28.008
Tsu'tey will lead the war party

2165
01:28:34.557 --> 01:28:35.766
Stop please!

2166
01:28:37.393 --> 01:28:39.353
This will only make it worse

2167
01:28:39.562 --> 01:28:41.188
You do not speak here!

2168
01:28:42.398 --> 01:28:44.233
We will strike them in the heart

2169
01:28:51.991 --> 01:28:54.118
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

2170
01:28:57.288 --> 01:28:58.789
- You!
- Listen. Brother--

2171
01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:07.423
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh, shit.

2172
01:29:08.757 --> 01:29:10.676
Is this true?

2173
01:29:12.261 --> 01:29:15.389
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

2174
01:29:16.807 --> 01:29:17.933
Brother, please.

2175
01:29:18.058 --> 01:29:21.812
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

2176
01:29:21.937 --> 01:29:24.190
You are not my brother!

2177
01:29:27.443 --> 01:29:29.153
And I am not your enemy!

2178
01:29:30.821 --> 01:29:33.657
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

2179
01:29:35.951 --> 01:29:37.703
Go! Go! Go!

2180
01:29:40.956 --> 01:29:43.375
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

2181
01:29:43.501 --> 01:29:44.835
Tsu'tey!

2182
01:29:51.091 --> 01:29:53.969
I am Omaticaya.
I am one of you.

2183
01:29:54.803 --> 01:29:57.014
And I have the right to speak.

2184
01:30:01.602 --> 01:30:03.521
I have something to say

2185
01:30:05.898 --> 01:30:07.399
to all of you

2186
01:30:11.403 --> 01:30:13.447
The words are like stones in my heart.

2187
01:30:17.826 --> 01:30:19.745
Sir, I'm sorry.
No, no, no! Hold on!

2188
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:22.081
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

2189
01:30:23.290 --> 01:30:24.625
It's very dangerous!

2190
01:30:27.253 --> 01:30:28.379
Grace!

2191
01:30:29.672 --> 01:30:30.798
Oh, no.

2192
01:30:31.048 --> 01:30:33.008
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

2193
01:30:34.552 --> 01:30:36.804
Okay. Look--

2194
01:30:37.888 --> 01:30:39.181
I was sent here to--

2195
01:30:42.852 --> 01:30:44.228
You see?

2196
01:30:44.436 --> 01:30:47.022
It is a demon in a false body

2197
01:31:06.792 --> 01:31:10.171
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.

2198
01:31:13.632 --> 01:31:15.759
Wheel this meat out of here.

2199
01:31:17.553 --> 01:31:20.055
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

2200
01:31:23.309 --> 01:31:25.060
You let me down, son.

2201
01:31:27.104 --> 01:31:28.314
So, what,

2202
01:31:29.857 --> 01:31:31.817
you find yourself some local tail

2203
01:31:31.942 --> 01:31:35.070
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

2204
01:31:35.196 --> 01:31:37.698
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

2205
01:31:37.823 --> 01:31:40.284
- Parker--
- Shut your pie hole!

2206
01:31:40.409 --> 01:31:44.580
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

2207
01:31:44.705 --> 01:31:47.416
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.

2208
01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:50.252
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

2209
01:31:50.377 --> 01:31:52.796
You say you want
to keep your people alive?

2210
01:31:52.922 --> 01:31:54.924
You start by listening to her.

2211
01:31:55.049 --> 01:31:57.259
Those trees were sacred
to the Omaticaya

2212
01:31:57.384 --> 01:31:59.136
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

2213
01:31:59.261 --> 01:32:01.514
You throw a stick in the air around here,

2214
01:32:01.639 --> 01:32:04.600
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

2215
01:32:04.725 --> 01:32:06.018
- for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking

2216
01:32:06.143 --> 01:32:10.523
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

2217
01:32:10.648 --> 01:32:13.275
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

2218
01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.818
Which is what, exactly?

2219
01:32:15.903 --> 01:32:17.196
What we think we know

2220
01:32:17.321 --> 01:32:20.658
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

2221
01:32:20.783 --> 01:32:25.120
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

2222
01:32:25.246 --> 01:32:29.792
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

2223
01:32:29.917 --> 01:32:33.087
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

2224
01:32:34.004 --> 01:32:36.215
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

2225
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.676
It's more connections
than the human brain.

2226
01:32:39.885 --> 01:32:42.388
Get it? It's a network.

2227
01:32:42.513 --> 01:32:45.474
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

2228
01:32:45.599 --> 01:32:49.061
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

2229
01:32:49.186 --> 01:32:51.856
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

2230
01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:53.524
Yes!

2231
01:32:54.775 --> 01:32:58.863
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

2232
01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:01.615
They're just goddamn trees!

2233
01:33:03.367 --> 01:33:06.078
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

2234
01:33:06.203 --> 01:33:10.666
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

2235
01:33:10.791 --> 01:33:14.461
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

2236
01:33:14.587 --> 01:33:18.841
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

2237
01:33:18.966 --> 01:33:23.596
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

2238
01:33:25.389 --> 01:33:27.808
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

2239
01:33:27.933 --> 01:33:30.102
They're not gonna give up their home

2240
01:33:31.937 --> 01:33:33.564
They're not gonna make a deal

2241
01:33:34.648 --> 01:33:36.901
For what? Lite beer?

2242
01:33:37.568 --> 01:33:39.028
And blue jeans?

2243
01:33:42.323 --> 01:33:45.201
There's nothing that we have
that they want

2244
01:33:47.119 --> 01:33:50.122
Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time

2245
01:33:55.085 --> 01:33:56.962
They're never gonna leave Hometree

2246
01:33:59.423 --> 01:34:05.387
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

2247
01:34:05.596 --> 01:34:10.059
Jake, thanks.
I'm getting all emotional.

2248
01:34:10.184 --> 01:34:12.728
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

2249
01:34:19.777 --> 01:34:23.113
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

2250
01:34:24.073 --> 01:34:26.534
I'll drive them out with gas first.

2251
01:34:27.785 --> 01:34:29.370
It'll be humane.

2252
01:34:30.996 --> 01:34:32.414
More or less.

2253
01:34:34.166 --> 01:34:36.001
All right, let's pull the trigger.

2254
01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:41.549
- Come on, people.
- Oh, man.

2255
01:34:41.674 --> 01:34:43.342
Let's pack it up, let's go.

2256
01:34:43.467 --> 01:34:45.261
This is how it's done.

2257
01:34:48.305 --> 01:34:51.600
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

2258
01:34:51.725 --> 01:34:55.729
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

2259
01:34:55.855 --> 01:34:59.275
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

2260
01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.401
My God.

2261
01:35:06.699 --> 01:35:10.870
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
- Back off!

2262
01:35:10.995 --> 01:35:14.665
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to--

2263
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:15.833
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

2264
01:35:15.958 --> 01:35:19.336
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

2265
01:35:19.461 --> 01:35:21.130
All right? Look around!

2266
01:35:21.255 --> 01:35:24.925
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

2267
01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:26.468
- Can you guys just please--
- Yes, sir.

2268
01:35:26.594 --> 01:35:29.054
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

2269
01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:30.431
Are you gonna kill children?

2270
01:35:30.556 --> 01:35:34.435
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

2271
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.896
Just let me try to talk them out.

2272
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:39.190
They trust me.

2273
01:35:42.526 --> 01:35:44.904
Calibrate fast.
We're going in, right now.

2274
01:35:45.029 --> 01:35:46.906
Calibrating three and four.

2275
01:35:47.031 --> 01:35:49.950
- Run sequence.
- Initiating. Thirty seconds.

2276
01:35:54.371 --> 01:35:56.040
Listen to me.
You've got one hour.

2277
01:35:56.165 --> 01:35:58.709
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

2278
01:35:58.834 --> 01:36:01.420
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

2279
01:36:07.343 --> 01:36:08.552
Father!

2280
01:36:08.761 --> 01:36:09.762
Mother!

2281
01:36:09.929 --> 01:36:13.098
Eytukan, I have something to say

2282
01:36:13.265 --> 01:36:14.517
Listen!

2283
01:36:15.643 --> 01:36:17.102
Speak, Jakesully

2284
01:36:18.479 --> 01:36:21.524
A great evil is upon us

2285
01:36:21.899 --> 01:36:23.651
The Sky People are coming

2286
01:36:23.984 --> 01:36:26.403
to destroy Hometree

2287
01:36:28.906 --> 01:36:30.282
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

2288
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:35.621
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

2289
01:36:35.746 --> 01:36:37.665
Are you certain of this?

2290
01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:45.130
Look, they sent me here
to learn your ways

2291
01:36:46.382 --> 01:36:49.593
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

2292
01:36:52.179 --> 01:36:55.766
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

2293
01:36:59.019 --> 01:37:00.479
Yes.

2294
01:37:00.604 --> 01:37:02.982
Look, at first it was just orders,

2295
01:37:04.525 --> 01:37:06.819
and then everything changed.

2296
01:37:06.944 --> 01:37:08.696
Okay? I fell in love.

2297
01:37:09.363 --> 01:37:14.618
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

2298
01:37:15.828 --> 01:37:17.246
And with you.

2299
01:37:18.289 --> 01:37:20.082
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

2300
01:37:20.207 --> 01:37:23.002
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now, please.

2301
01:37:30.426 --> 01:37:32.803
You will never be one of The People!

2302
01:37:32.928 --> 01:37:34.680
- I shouldn't have--
- We tried to stop them!

2303
01:37:34.805 --> 01:37:36.765
Neytiri, please! Please.

2304
01:37:41.770 --> 01:37:42.813
Bind them

2305
01:37:44.607 --> 01:37:45.649
Leave now!

2306
01:37:45.816 --> 01:37:49.111
You have to go.
They're coming!

2307
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.169
Time on target, one mike

2308
01:38:05.294 --> 01:38:07.213
Copy. We have a visual

2309
01:38:07.338 --> 01:38:10.299
Roger that.
Stay on heading 030

2310
01:38:10.424 --> 01:38:11.759
Roger, 030

2311
01:38:25.564 --> 01:38:27.566
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

2312
01:38:29.235 --> 01:38:33.030
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri, you must go now!

2313
01:38:36.867 --> 01:38:39.119
Run to the forest! Run!

2314
01:38:41.539 --> 01:38:42.832
Run! Run!

2315
01:38:42.998 --> 01:38:46.544
Have no fear

2316
01:39:03.394 --> 01:39:07.064
No! God damn it, run!

2317
01:39:07.398 --> 01:39:08.774
Take the ikran,

2318
01:39:08.941 --> 01:39:10.401
attack from above

2319
01:39:14.738 --> 01:39:16.866
That is one big damn tree.

2320
01:39:24.415 --> 01:39:28.586
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

2321
01:39:30.588 --> 01:39:32.673
All right, people,
let's get this done!

2322
01:39:32.798 --> 01:39:35.593
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

2323
01:39:35.718 --> 01:39:37.720
Roger. CS .40's going hot.

2324
01:39:38.095 --> 01:39:39.263
- Fire.
- Firing.

2325
01:39:50.774 --> 01:39:52.735
Bingo.
Mighty good shooting, ace.

2326
01:40:00.743 --> 01:40:02.328
Sir, they've opened fire.

2327
01:40:04.288 --> 01:40:05.956
You've got to be kidding me!

2328
01:40:18.552 --> 01:40:21.055
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

2329
01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.806
All right, let's turn up the heat.

2330
01:40:22.932 --> 01:40:25.809
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.

2331
01:40:25.935 --> 01:40:26.977
Fire

2332
01:40:30.314 --> 01:40:31.357
No!

2333
01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.330
Get everyone to the forest

2334
01:40:49.792 --> 01:40:51.961
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

2335
01:40:55.714 --> 01:40:56.924
Neytiri!

2336
01:41:05.641 --> 01:41:08.644
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

2337
01:41:08.769 --> 01:41:09.979
My God!

2338
01:41:28.581 --> 01:41:31.917
- Mo'at! No!
- If you are one of us,

2339
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.795
help us.

2340
01:41:42.553 --> 01:41:44.513
All call signs, switch missiles.

2341
01:41:44.722 --> 01:41:47.141
Give me HE's
at the base of the west columns

2342
01:41:49.101 --> 01:41:50.352
This way!

2343
01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.355
Rider section, switch missiles

2344
01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:55.357
- One's good.
- Two's rocks up

2345
01:41:55.482 --> 01:41:58.027
- Three's up.
- Yeah, baby, get some!

2346
01:41:58.569 --> 01:42:00.821
Charlie Oscar,
Gunrunner standing by

2347
01:42:00.946 --> 01:42:02.281
- Bring it down.
- Cleared hot

2348
01:42:09.413 --> 01:42:10.915
Come on, Grace, move!

2349
01:42:13.584 --> 01:42:15.169
Down! Head down!

2350
01:42:17.755 --> 01:42:19.965
Come on, come on! Down!

2351
01:42:24.762 --> 01:42:26.722
- Solid hits.
- Solid rocks on target

2352
01:42:26.847 --> 01:42:28.015
Screw this.

2353
01:42:29.266 --> 01:42:31.227
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

2354
01:42:31.352 --> 01:42:33.103
I didn't sign up for this shit!

2355
01:42:42.821 --> 01:42:44.657
Repeat. Ripple fire

2356
01:43:28.284 --> 01:43:29.785
Go! Go! Go!

2357
01:44:02.902 --> 01:44:05.321
No, no, get back! Back!

2358
01:44:24.381 --> 01:44:26.926
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

2359
01:45:11.971 --> 01:45:15.558
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

2360
01:45:16.267 --> 01:45:17.518
Let's boogie.

2361
01:45:17.935 --> 01:45:20.312
Dragon coming left,
heading home

2362
01:45:20.813 --> 01:45:22.731
Gunrunner coming left

2363
01:45:22.857 --> 01:45:25.317
- Thunder copies.
- Rider section copies

2364
01:45:33.033 --> 01:45:34.034
Father!

2365
01:45:50.009 --> 01:45:51.177
Daughter,

2366
01:45:52.428 --> 01:45:55.639
take my bow

2367
01:45:59.643 --> 01:46:04.064
Protect The People

2368
01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:13.657
Neytiri!

2369
01:46:23.751 --> 01:46:27.463
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get away.

2370
01:46:28.172 --> 01:46:29.381
Get away!

2371
01:46:30.508 --> 01:46:32.218
Get away from here!

2372
01:46:33.719 --> 01:46:35.304
Never come back!

2373
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:54.114
Pull the plug.

2374
01:46:55.115 --> 01:46:57.701
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

2375
01:46:57.827 --> 01:46:59.745
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

2376
01:47:15.970 --> 01:47:18.514
I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace

2377
01:47:19.932 --> 01:47:23.811
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up

2378
01:47:26.647 --> 01:47:28.065
Let's go!

2379
01:47:35.948 --> 01:47:37.533
Put him down!

2380
01:47:40.911 --> 01:47:43.622
You murderer!

2381
01:48:30.294 --> 01:48:32.379
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

2382
01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:33.506
Hey.

2383
01:48:34.924 --> 01:48:37.593
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

2384
01:48:37.718 --> 01:48:41.013
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

2385
01:48:42.097 --> 01:48:44.600
Yeah. You know what that is.
Down.

2386
01:48:44.725 --> 01:48:47.186
- Trudy!
- All the way down.

2387
01:48:50.648 --> 01:48:51.815
Max!

2388
01:49:01.909 --> 01:49:04.411
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

2389
01:49:04.995 --> 01:49:06.080
Here.

2390
01:49:18.175 --> 01:49:20.594
- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.

2391
01:49:36.193 --> 01:49:40.072
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

2392
01:49:40.197 --> 01:49:41.407
Okay. Go.

2393
01:49:55.254 --> 01:49:56.380
Clear.

2394
01:49:58.382 --> 01:49:59.592
Come on, baby.

2395
01:49:59.717 --> 01:50:02.469
Colonel? Sir?
I got a situation here.

2396
01:50:06.098 --> 01:50:09.101
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

2397
01:50:12.188 --> 01:50:13.439
Three!

2398
01:50:16.317 --> 01:50:17.484
Come on!

2399
01:50:19.528 --> 01:50:20.821
Mask on!

2400
01:50:23.407 --> 01:50:25.201
Gas, gas, gas!

2401
01:50:26.869 --> 01:50:28.871
I'm taking fire!
Let's go!

2402
01:50:31.373 --> 01:50:34.502
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

2403
01:50:35.503 --> 01:50:37.296
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go!

2404
01:50:49.975 --> 01:50:51.268
Colonel!

2405
01:50:58.067 --> 01:51:01.529
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

2406
01:51:04.782 --> 01:51:07.409
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?

2407
01:51:07.535 --> 01:51:08.994
Oh, yeah, baby!

2408
01:51:09.119 --> 01:51:10.955
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

2409
01:51:11.872 --> 01:51:14.166
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

2410
01:51:14.458 --> 01:51:16.210
- Grace is hit!
- What?

2411
01:51:17.419 --> 01:51:18.963
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

2412
01:51:19.088 --> 01:51:22.550
- Keep the pressure on, Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

2413
01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:27.096
- Hang on, Grace.
- Doesn't matter. It's fine.

2414
01:51:30.474 --> 01:51:32.893
- You're good to go.
- Take it up!

2415
01:51:34.103 --> 01:51:35.896
Hold on.
I'm pulling pitch

2416
01:51:40.359 --> 01:51:41.777
You're clear!

2417
01:51:49.743 --> 01:51:52.454
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

2418
01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:53.956
Copy that

2419
01:52:00.963 --> 01:52:04.258
- Norm, you all good up there?
- Yep! Still here

2420
01:52:06.135 --> 01:52:10.764
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

2421
01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:12.933
It's strongest
at the Tree of Souls, right?

2422
01:52:13.058 --> 01:52:14.476
Yeah

2423
01:52:14.602 --> 01:52:16.520
Good. 'Cause that's
where we're going.

2424
01:52:25.404 --> 01:52:26.530
Ouch.

2425
01:52:29.992 --> 01:52:31.368
You big baby.

2426
01:52:32.745 --> 01:52:34.163
We're moving.

2427
01:52:34.747 --> 01:52:36.790
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

2428
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:39.877
I'm a scientist, remember?

2429
01:52:40.836 --> 01:52:43.255
I don't believe in fairy tales.

2430
01:52:44.131 --> 01:52:46.008
The People can help you.

2431
01:52:46.509 --> 01:52:47.801
I know it.

2432
01:52:49.803 --> 01:52:51.639
Why would they help us?

2433
01:53:07.696 --> 01:53:10.783
The People say Eywa will provide

2434
01:53:12.743 --> 01:53:15.412
With no home, no hope,

2435
01:53:16.539 --> 01:53:18.666
there was only one place they could go

2436
01:53:33.097 --> 01:53:34.265
Link's running.

2437
01:53:35.015 --> 01:53:37.977
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.

2438
01:53:39.061 --> 01:53:43.691
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place

2439
01:53:44.733 --> 01:53:46.068
I gotta try.

2440
01:53:48.863 --> 01:53:50.156
Launching.

2441
01:54:11.677 --> 01:54:12.887
Outcast

2442
01:54:13.679 --> 01:54:14.889
Betrayer

2443
01:54:16.015 --> 01:54:17.141
Alien

2444
01:54:18.726 --> 01:54:21.395
I was in the place
the eye does not see

2445
01:54:32.615 --> 01:54:36.452
I needed their help,
and they needed mine

2446
01:54:37.411 --> 01:54:39.371
But to ever face them again,

2447
01:54:39.497 --> 01:54:41.916
I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level

2448
01:54:50.508 --> 01:54:53.802
Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move

2449
01:54:56.597 --> 01:54:58.933
There's something we gotta do.

2450
01:54:59.058 --> 01:55:00.726
You're not gonna like it.

2451
01:55:10.778 --> 01:55:14.573
The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky

2452
01:55:14.698 --> 01:55:16.283
Nothing attacks him

2453
01:55:16.826 --> 01:55:18.118
Easy, boy.

2454
01:55:18.619 --> 01:55:20.412
So why would he ever look up?

2455
01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:23.165
But that was just a theory

2456
01:56:33.903 --> 01:56:35.488
Toruk Macto?

2457
01:57:15.319 --> 01:57:16.779
I see you.

2458
01:57:19.907 --> 01:57:21.200
I see you.

2459
01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:31.210
I was afraid, Jake.

2460
01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:34.129
For my people.

2461
01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:38.801
I'm not anymore.

2462
01:57:48.310 --> 01:57:50.563
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo,

2463
01:57:51.313 --> 01:57:53.190
I stand before you

2464
01:57:54.316 --> 01:57:57.361
ready to serve
the Omaticaya people

2465
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:04.243
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior

2466
01:58:05.452 --> 01:58:07.580
I can't do this without you.

2467
01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:16.046
Toruk Macto,

2468
01:58:23.929 --> 01:58:25.639
I will fly with you.

2469
01:58:28.976 --> 01:58:30.686
My friend is dying.

2470
01:58:33.105 --> 01:58:34.607
Grace is dying.

2471
01:58:36.650 --> 01:58:38.486
I beg the help of Eywa.

2472
01:58:50.414 --> 01:58:52.374
Look where we are, Grace.

2473
01:58:59.131 --> 01:59:01.467
I need to take some samples.

2474
01:59:24.949 --> 01:59:28.994
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

2475
01:59:30.246 --> 01:59:31.664
in this body.

2476
01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:35.876
Is that possible?

2477
01:59:36.001 --> 01:59:40.464
She must pass through
the eye of Eywa and return.

2478
01:59:41.757 --> 01:59:43.259
But, Jakesully,

2479
01:59:44.301 --> 01:59:45.886
she is very weak.

2480
01:59:47.388 --> 01:59:50.182
Hang on, Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.

2481
01:59:53.477 --> 01:59:56.021
Hear us please, All Mother

2482
01:59:56.647 --> 01:59:58.858
Eywa, help her

2483
01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:01.777
Take this spirit into you

2484
02:00:05.447 --> 02:00:07.533
and breathe her back to us

2485
02:00:11.453 --> 02:00:13.038
Let her walk among us

2486
02:00:15.624 --> 02:00:17.501
as one of The People

2487
02:00:46.447 --> 02:00:47.490
Jake.

2488
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:51.076
Grace.

2489
02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:54.914
I'm with her, Jake.

2490
02:00:56.957 --> 02:00:58.292
She's real!

2491
02:01:01.378 --> 02:01:04.507
Grace? Grace, please.
Grace!

2492
02:01:05.716 --> 02:01:07.301
What's happening?

2493
02:01:08.302 --> 02:01:09.929
What's happening?

2494
02:01:14.308 --> 02:01:15.434
Grace!

2495
02:01:16.185 --> 02:01:17.311
Grace!

2496
02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:21.023
What's happening?

2497
02:01:27.321 --> 02:01:28.697
Did it work?

2498
02:01:34.411 --> 02:01:38.457
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

2499
02:01:40.167 --> 02:01:41.877
She is with Eywa now.

2500
02:02:15.703 --> 02:02:18.330
With your permission,
I will speak now.

2501
02:02:20.749 --> 02:02:23.169
You would honor me by translating.

2502
02:02:30.301 --> 02:02:32.469
The Sky People have sent us a message,

2503
02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:38.267
that they can take
whatever they want,

2504
02:02:40.102 --> 02:02:41.854
and no one can stop them.

2505
02:02:45.483 --> 02:02:47.234
Well, we will send them a message.

2506
02:02:49.904 --> 02:02:52.198
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

2507
02:02:55.534 --> 02:02:57.870
You tell the other clans to come.

2508
02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.501
You tell them
Toruk Macto calls to them

2509
02:03:05.753 --> 02:03:08.506
And you fly now with me!

2510
02:03:09.590 --> 02:03:12.051
My brothers! Sisters!

2511
02:03:13.177 --> 02:03:15.221
And we will show the Sky People

2512
02:03:16.263 --> 02:03:18.098
that they cannot take whatever they want,

2513
02:03:19.642 --> 02:03:21.060
and that this,

2514
02:03:21.810 --> 02:03:22.811
this is our land!

2515
02:04:36.218 --> 02:04:37.678
We rode out to the four winds

2516
02:04:40.472 --> 02:04:42.850
To the horse clans of the plain

2517
02:04:45.853 --> 02:04:46.854
Back to the stars!

2518
02:04:46.979 --> 02:04:49.148
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea

2519
02:04:49.273 --> 02:04:50.483
For our children's children!

2520
02:04:50.608 --> 02:04:53.152
When Toruk Macto called them,
they came

2521
02:05:34.568 --> 02:05:37.029
Everyone on this base,
every one of you,

2522
02:05:37.154 --> 02:05:38.948
is fighting for survival.

2523
02:05:39.073 --> 02:05:40.533
That's a fact!

2524
02:05:41.408 --> 02:05:45.120
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

2525
02:05:46.247 --> 02:05:50.084
Now, these orbital images tell me

2526
02:05:50.543 --> 02:05:53.712
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

2527
02:05:53.838 --> 02:05:56.340
to well over 2,000 in one day.

2528
02:05:56.924 --> 02:05:58.884
And more are pouring in.

2529
02:06:01.387 --> 02:06:04.765
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

2530
02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:07.184
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

2531
02:06:07.309 --> 02:06:09.478
Well, that's not gonna happen!

2532
02:06:11.105 --> 02:06:14.692
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

2533
02:06:14.817 --> 02:06:17.153
We will fight terror with terror.

2534
02:06:21.490 --> 02:06:25.619
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

2535
02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:28.080
is protected by their--

2536
02:06:28.205 --> 02:06:29.540
Their deity.

2537
02:06:30.875 --> 02:06:32.918
And when we destroy it,

2538
02:06:33.043 --> 02:06:35.337
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

2539
02:06:35.462 --> 02:06:38.924
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks
of this place ever again.

2540
02:06:39.049 --> 02:06:41.719
And that, too, is a fact.

2541
02:06:42.469 --> 02:06:44.180
Yeah! Yeah.

2542
02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:58.611
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber

2543
02:06:58.736 --> 02:07:00.946
They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives

2544
02:07:01.071 --> 02:07:03.949
It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign

2545
02:07:04.074 --> 02:07:05.951
Fricking daisy cutters!

2546
02:07:07.495 --> 02:07:10.289
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him

2547
02:07:10.414 --> 02:07:12.458
- When?
- 0600 tomorrow

2548
02:07:12.583 --> 02:07:14.418
- Max! Max!
- I gotta go

2549
02:07:16.337 --> 02:07:17.796
We're screwed!

2550
02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:21.467
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

2551
02:07:21.592 --> 02:07:23.761
that didn't involve martyrdom.

2552
02:07:25.262 --> 02:07:28.599
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

2553
02:07:31.644 --> 02:07:33.646
I have 15 clans out there.

2554
02:07:34.355 --> 02:07:36.440
That's over 2,000 warriors.

2555
02:07:37.983 --> 02:07:42.404
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

2556
02:07:43.489 --> 02:07:47.493
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

2557
02:07:48.035 --> 02:07:49.495
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

2558
02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:53.833
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

2559
02:07:55.751 --> 02:07:59.171
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

2560
02:07:59.296 --> 02:08:00.464
Yeah, I know.

2561
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:03.050
If they get to the Tree of Souls,
it's over.

2562
02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:06.345
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

2563
02:08:07.179 --> 02:08:09.139
It'll destroy them.

2564
02:08:09.265 --> 02:08:11.642
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

2565
02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:29.702
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

2566
02:08:32.163 --> 02:08:36.876
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

2567
02:08:39.461 --> 02:08:43.841
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

2568
02:08:45.134 --> 02:08:47.219
See the world we come from.

2569
02:08:48.345 --> 02:08:50.222
There's no green there.

2570
02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:53.601
They killed their Mother.

2571
02:08:54.435 --> 02:08:56.896
And they're gonna do the same here.

2572
02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:01.108
More Sky People are gonna come.

2573
02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:04.236
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

2574
02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:07.281
Unless we stop them.

2575
02:09:09.909 --> 02:09:12.953
Look, you chose me for something.

2576
02:09:14.455 --> 02:09:16.290
I will stand and fight.

2577
02:09:17.374 --> 02:09:18.918
You know I will.

2578
02:09:21.462 --> 02:09:23.672
But I need a little help here.

2579
02:09:29.845 --> 02:09:32.848
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

2580
02:09:34.683 --> 02:09:38.103
She protects only the balance of life.

2581
02:09:49.949 --> 02:09:51.617
It was worth a try.

2582
02:10:22.356 --> 02:10:24.316
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

2583
02:10:24.441 --> 02:10:27.736
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

2584
02:10:39.874 --> 02:10:43.210
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex

2585
02:10:43.627 --> 02:10:47.173
- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode

2586
02:11:22.124 --> 02:11:23.959
This is Papa Dragon.

2587
02:11:24.084 --> 02:11:27.129
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

2588
02:11:34.678 --> 02:11:38.390
- Suit Team, go.
- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

2589
02:11:48.984 --> 02:11:50.569
Move, move, move!

2590
02:11:56.242 --> 02:11:57.993
Bravo 1-1, move left

2591
02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:01.956
Bravo 1-1 moving left.
Watch flank

2592
02:12:04.333 --> 02:12:07.878
- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that

2593
02:12:08.003 --> 02:12:10.339
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing

2594
02:12:10.464 --> 02:12:11.757
Copy that. Over

2595
02:12:11.882 --> 02:12:16.512
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

2596
02:12:17.137 --> 02:12:20.432
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target

2597
02:12:20.558 --> 02:12:22.935
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle

2598
02:12:28.065 --> 02:12:30.568
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

2599
02:12:31.569 --> 02:12:34.155
Gun crews,
keep your head on a swivel

2600
02:12:34.321 --> 02:12:37.199
Make no mistake, people,
they're out there

2601
02:12:38.826 --> 02:12:42.037
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

2602
02:12:42.163 --> 02:12:44.331
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

2603
02:12:44.498 --> 02:12:46.959
- Copy. Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

2604
02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:49.962
Roll it to the ramp!
Let's go!

2605
02:12:52.256 --> 02:12:53.299
Hold!

2606
02:13:01.348 --> 02:13:03.350
Charlie 2-1, got big movement

2607
02:13:03.475 --> 02:13:04.852
- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up

2608
02:13:04.977 --> 02:13:09.106
- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1, hold position

2609
02:13:15.237 --> 02:13:18.157
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

2610
02:13:18.282 --> 02:13:20.784
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
- Firing line!

2611
02:13:21.202 --> 02:13:23.871
Targets closing.
Range, 400 meters

2612
02:13:24.622 --> 02:13:27.333
- Can't you clean it up?
- No, sir. It's the Flux.

2613
02:13:55.653 --> 02:13:58.280
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

2614
02:14:40.072 --> 02:14:42.783
All aircraft, weapons free!
Weapons free!

2615
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:45.119
Break right. Come around.

2616
02:14:48.706 --> 02:14:50.166
Light them up!

2617
02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:00.009
Break formation,
engage all hostiles.

2618
02:15:07.308 --> 02:15:09.143
Yeah! Get some!

2619
02:15:48.182 --> 02:15:49.975
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

2620
02:16:00.861 --> 02:16:02.613
Jake! Jake! You copy?

2621
02:16:03.322 --> 02:16:05.991
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

2622
02:16:06.116 --> 02:16:07.117
Copy. Get out of there.

2623
02:16:12.206 --> 02:16:13.582
That's him. Get after him!

2624
02:16:30.558 --> 02:16:32.017
Take him out!

2625
02:16:40.359 --> 02:16:41.777
Light her up!

2626
02:16:50.828 --> 02:16:52.204
Right there!

2627
02:16:52.371 --> 02:16:54.582
You're not the only one
with a gun, bitch.

2628
02:16:54.874 --> 02:16:56.500
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

2629
02:16:56.625 --> 02:16:57.626
Arming all pods.

2630
02:17:03.382 --> 02:17:04.425
That's it!

2631
02:17:35.122 --> 02:17:36.207
Seze!

2632
02:18:40.187 --> 02:18:42.356
Rogue One is hit.
I'm going in

2633
02:18:43.274 --> 02:18:44.650
Sorry, Jake.

2634
02:18:53.534 --> 02:18:54.577
Fire.

2635
02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:15.181
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

2636
02:19:18.058 --> 02:19:19.685
Rogue One, you copy?

2637
02:19:21.729 --> 02:19:22.855
Trudy!

2638
02:19:33.782 --> 02:19:35.034
Time to target, two minutes.

2639
02:19:35.409 --> 02:19:37.786
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

2640
02:19:37.912 --> 02:19:40.039
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

2641
02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:49.715
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!

2642
02:19:51.175 --> 02:19:52.343
Ma Jake!

2643
02:19:54.303 --> 02:19:55.429
I read you.

2644
02:20:04.605 --> 02:20:06.565
- Neytiri!
- Seze's dead

2645
02:20:07.191 --> 02:20:09.652
They are very close.
They are many.

2646
02:20:11.111 --> 02:20:12.571
Do not attack.

2647
02:20:13.197 --> 02:20:15.115
Do you read me, Neytiri?

2648
02:20:17.743 --> 02:20:18.994
Do not attack!

2649
02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:22.498
Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!

2650
02:20:30.631 --> 02:20:31.799
Neytiri!

2651
02:20:33.926 --> 02:20:35.803
I got movement, I got movement

2652
02:20:35.928 --> 02:20:38.138
Hold position.
Something's coming.

2653
02:20:38.264 --> 02:20:40.015
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over

2654
02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:42.268
- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation

2655
02:20:42.393 --> 02:20:44.061
- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks

2656
02:20:49.233 --> 02:20:50.693
Hundred meters and closing fast

2657
02:21:07.293 --> 02:21:09.253
We gotta get out of here!

2658
02:21:10.796 --> 02:21:12.464
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Move! Move! Move!

2659
02:21:12.590 --> 02:21:14.967
Fall back!
On the run! On the run!

2660
02:21:22.141 --> 02:21:24.810
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

2661
02:21:31.692 --> 02:21:33.444
Eywa has heard you!

2662
02:21:44.038 --> 02:21:45.414
Come on!

2663
02:21:57.718 --> 02:21:59.553
Fall back! Move! Move!

2664
02:22:24.078 --> 02:22:26.664
Sir! All escorts are down
or falling back.

2665
02:22:26.789 --> 02:22:30.876
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

2666
02:22:31.001 --> 02:22:33.838
- Press to target.
- Copy. Pressing to target

2667
02:22:33.963 --> 02:22:35.923
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

2668
02:22:55.776 --> 02:22:58.195
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

2669
02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:00.990
Drop! Drop! Drop!
Go, go, go, go!

2670
02:23:34.773 --> 02:23:35.900
Brace!

2671
02:23:52.958 --> 02:23:54.251
It's Sully.

2672
02:24:08.015 --> 02:24:10.267
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

2673
02:26:47.466 --> 02:26:49.301
Come on. Come to papa.

2674
02:27:16.829 --> 02:27:18.581
Give it up, Quaritch!

2675
02:27:21.667 --> 02:27:23.127
It's all over.

2676
02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:26.839
Nothing's over while I'm breathing

2677
02:27:26.964 --> 02:27:29.216
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

2678
02:28:25.397 --> 02:28:26.565
Come on!

2679
02:28:42.498 --> 02:28:46.544
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

2680
02:28:51.257 --> 02:28:53.384
You think you're one of them?

2681
02:28:54.677 --> 02:28:56.262
Time to wake up.

2682
02:30:40.533 --> 02:30:41.534
Jake?

2683
02:30:55.297 --> 02:30:56.340
Jake.

2684
02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:15.734
Jake.

2685
02:31:31.834 --> 02:31:33.794
Jake! Ma Jake!

2686
02:32:15.461 --> 02:32:16.754
I see you.

2687
02:32:22.468 --> 02:32:23.761
I see you.

2688
02:32:35.397 --> 02:32:38.192
The aliens went back
to their dying world

2689
02:32:40.402 --> 02:32:43.280
Only a few were chosen to stay

2690
02:32:55.501 --> 02:32:57.962
The time of great sorrow was ending

2691
02:33:00.089 --> 02:33:02.466
Toruk Macto was no longer needed

2692
02:33:15.020 --> 02:33:18.899
Well, I guess this is
my last video log

2693
02:33:20.776 --> 02:33:24.530
'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm-- 

2694
02:33:25.614 --> 02:33:28.409
I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place

2695
02:33:32.037 --> 02:33:34.165
Well, I guess I'd better go

2696
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:39.795
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party

2697
02:33:43.174 --> 02:33:45.551
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all

2698
02:33:48.137 --> 02:33:50.389
This is Jake Sully signing off
