1
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:15,144
I've never gone parking before.

2
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:17,452
I'm really not that kind of a girl.

3
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:21,483
Well, I'm not the kind of a guy
who would go with that kind of a girl.

4
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:24,326
Oh, that's so sweet. I think.

5
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:27,232
There's nothing to be scared of.

6
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,310
I knew this would happen if we made out!

7
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:56,823
Good shot, son.

8
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:05,405
General, I think he's surrendering.

9
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:17,441
Run! Run!

10
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:19,651
Fire at will!

11
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:33,729
Help!

12
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,136
Keep firing. Keep firing! Keep firing!

13
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,106
Kill every last alien!

14
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,043
<i>You will all become my alien zombies.</i>

15
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,815
<i>- Command us, Master!
- Ouch, Mom!</i>

16
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:07,098
What did I tell you
about these kind of movies?

17
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,067
It was almost over!

18
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:12,367
- Besides, they're all the same.
- That's not true.

19
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:35,125
You know, he looks just like his father.

20
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:37,863
Just like his father.

21
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,639
Oh, I hate the rain.

22
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:31,678
Raining rocks and dogs. Great!

23
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,178
Space,

24
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:06,276
a universe of mystery.

25
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:09,447
Well, today, the mystery will be unveiled.

26
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:15,518
Thanks to science, we now know
the universe is nearly 500 miles long

27
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,662
and it contains,
you're not going to believe this,

28
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,694
over 1,000 stars.

29
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,365
Lem, come on! Liven it up.

30
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:30,740
And still, the only known intelligent life

31
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:34,241
is right here on our planet.

32
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,947
No, not today! Not today! Please.

33
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:44,490
What was that?

34
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:47,584
That's our planet
after the attack of the Humaniacs.

35
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:50,721
They're gonna eat our brains for dinner!

36
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,287
Is that true?

37
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:55,392
Everybody, please, that's ridiculous.

38
00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:00,065
Totally ridiculous.
Brains for dinner? Come on!

39
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:03,405
Brains are for breakfast with cereal and milk.

40
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:05,775
Dinner is organs and eyeballs.

41
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:12,108
Okay, everyone, everyone, please, listen up.

42
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,716
We're not getting eaten

43
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:18,815
or harvested
or having our brains barbecued.

44
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:23,223
The universe isn't scary. It's really amazing.

45
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:29,891
And don't forget to pick up
your planetary yo-yos.

46
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,738
We've got one for each of you.

47
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:44,611
You're looking at the new
Junior Assistant Curator!

48
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:46,117
High four!

49
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:50,590
Well, it's part-time now
and full-time after I graduate.

50
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:52,284
- How did you do, Lem?
- Got the job!

51
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,690
Knew you would.

52
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,193
Hey, I can see my whole life.

53
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:59,164
A house, a car, two kids,
they'll grow up and have kids.

54
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,200
They'll come home to visit on holidays.

55
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,929
- Well?
- Got it!

56
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:06,598
<i>Lem, congratulations on that job.</i>

57
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:09,837
<i>- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

58
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:13,803
Oh, wow!

59
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:22,579
- There it is. Just two more days.
- Wow.

60
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:27,626
<i>Humaniacs III:
The Final Battle for Our World.</i>

61
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:31,226
- Victory or extinction!
- Victory or extinction!

62
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,594
If you guys go in costume,
I'm pretending we never met.

63
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:41,234
Did you just say what I think you just said?

64
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,776
I'm a planetarium professional now.

65
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,836
I don't have time for kids' movies anymore.

66
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:51,643
Kids' movies?
I suppose next you'll say aliens don't exist.

67
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:52,844
Duh!

68
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:56,512
Just as I thought. You're not Lem.

69
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,457
<i>You're an alien zombie, like in Humaniacs II.</i>

70
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,289
Skiff, I'm not a zombie.

71
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:04,262
Yeah, that's what you zombies
are programmed to say.

72
00:08:04,331 --> 00:08:06,424
Tell me something the real Lem would know.

73
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,162
Well, I know Skiff is the only nutcase

74
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:13,366
who thinks the government
is hiding all alien evidence in Base 9.

75
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,067
And you give candy to your puppy
so he'll poop jelly beans.

76
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:20,908
It was just an experiment.

77
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:23,242
With all due respect,

78
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:26,683
I've put in the hours
and done a lot of alien research at work.

79
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:29,745
What are you talking about?
You work in a comic book store!

80
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:33,224
The greatest source of scientific knowledge.

81
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:36,729
Skiff, time to unpack the fake alien poop.

82
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:38,286
Right away, Mr. Haglug.

83
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:42,528
You will believe me, Lem,
when aliens put you on the takeout menu.

84
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,496
- Wow!
- Skiff!

85
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:48,006
I love fake-alien-poop day.

86
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:54,743
So, Eckle, do you think your sister's home?

87
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:57,345
- Why?
- I thought maybe...

88
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,476
I thought I might tell her I got the job.

89
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:02,215
- Why?
- Forget it. You tell her for me. Okay?

90
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:05,383
Okay, but every time you tell me
to tell her something,

91
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,892
she asks
why don't you just tell her yourself?

92
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,485
- What?
- And then my mom says

93
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:13,693
it's because you like her,
and then she says that, "Oh, that's so cute,"

94
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,928
and why don't you just ask her out already,

95
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:18,527
'cause she's been waiting
for you to ask her out

96
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,971
ever since we moved next door to you.

97
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:25,602
She has? The girl of my dreams likes me?

98
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,710
This is the best day of my life.

99
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:30,272
Yeah, we got to see that kid throw up.

100
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:34,920
Hey, he did it!

101
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:38,924
- He got the job!
- We're so proud of you.

102
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:44,687
I hear it's just one easy step up
to Senior Assistant Curator.

103
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,712
Come on, soldier. Take that hill.

104
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:08,051
- Hey, Neera.
- Hey, Lem.

105
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,388
I wanted to tell you, I got the job.

106
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,756
Lem, that's great!

107
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:18,025
- Maybe it's time that you and me...
- Yes?

108
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:20,797
I mean, would you want to...

109
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:26,998
Hey, Neera!
I've been looking all over for you.

110
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:30,702
- You've been looking for me?
- The cause needs you.

111
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:33,206
- The what?
- The cause.

112
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,107
Glar's involved with something
he calls "protesting."

113
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,777
It's like when you shout about stuff
that makes you upset.

114
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,946
Yeah, like our school pictures.

115
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:44,388
Why do they have to be of our faces?

116
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,448
I mean, what a bummer.

117
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,327
That means it's not good.

118
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:51,023
Neera, we need you! Righteous momma!

119
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:56,399
I'm so honored,
but Lem was about to ask me something.

120
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:59,400
Yeah? Man, what do you want to ask her?

121
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:03,175
- It's kind of private.
- No problemo, man!

122
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,671
I mean, I totally respect that.

123
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:08,073
So, Neera...

124
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:12,448
<i>Neera and Lem had a private conversation</i>

125
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:16,314
<i>And don't want anybody else around</i>

126
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:19,552
Yeah, you know, we can talk later.

127
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:20,820
Okay.

128
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,287
Peace.

129
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:24,728
That means, "See you later."

130
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:34,598
Bye!

131
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:36,632
Bye.

132
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:43,110
"The cause, man."

133
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:46,675
I'd like to cause him some pain.

134
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,855
I don't want to hear a single bubble.

135
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,152
Especially you, Bubbles.

136
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:41,866
Call the General! Call the General!

137
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,439
It's in the Containment Room.
Lock this section down, now!

138
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,296
Resistance is futile. Surrender or die.

139
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,102
Come on, Eckle. Go help your father.

140
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,189
What the...

141
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:46,283
Duck?

142
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,472
Wow!

143
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,745
No! No! No! No! No!

144
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,414
Mom, Dad, there's a ship in the...

145
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:50,979
My car!

146
00:16:53,593 --> 00:16:57,324
Open wide
or the big, bad monster will get you.

147
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:42,932
The battle for our world has begun.

148
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:46,311
- Captain, mobilize the army.
- Yes, sir!

149
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,244
Right, men, move it!

150
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:16,870
<i>Are they hostile? Will our species survive?</i>

151
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,004
<i>One thing we do know is</i>

152
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:22,113
<i>that they show no respect for
our parking laws.</i>

153
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:24,482
<i>And speaking of survival,</i>

154
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,951
<i>how will you survive
without a sparkling smile?</i>

155
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,614
<i>Give your smile that special glow</i>

156
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,454
<i>Try the sparkle action of Dental Pro</i>

157
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,529
You know,
you're really good as that toothbrush.

158
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:46,037
Yeah. But what I really do best
is a suppository.

159
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:55,908
Now, let's see. Invasion by giant ants.

160
00:18:56,382 --> 00:18:58,009
Invasion by sea monsters.

161
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,485
Invasion by 50-foot woman?

162
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:05,249
<i>Here it is,
So, You've Been Invaded by Aliens.</i>

163
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:15,226
- Keep your eyes on the aliens.
- Aliens?

164
00:19:19,872 --> 00:19:22,932
All right, class, let's try it one more time.

165
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,276
The aliens are coming!

166
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:31,574
Flarc, you were too slow.
Go join the zombies.

167
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:38,757
I called it. The only question is,

168
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:41,687
should I be terrified
because it's the end of the world

169
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:45,060
or happy because I totally called it?

170
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:48,131
Me, I have a plan.

171
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,796
They're gonna need a native
to run the mines.

172
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,170
I'll befriend them,
show my executive skills, and bam! I'm in.

173
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,632
Speaking of "bam! I'm in..."

174
00:19:58,377 --> 00:19:59,571
A cork?

175
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,580
It's your best defense against the aliens'
favorite form of research.

176
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,115
The probe.

177
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,783
You put it...

178
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:09,014
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I get it.
- Oh, wait.

179
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:11,852
This is yours. I already used that one.

180
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,820
I just remembered, my job.

181
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:18,096
Gotta go. You know, my boss.

182
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:21,429
Your boss? No problem.
You guys can share.

183
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:11,307
<i>Neera, you have to choose.</i>

184
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,316
It's either me or Glar.

185
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:17,922
Oh, Lem, there's no question.

186
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,188
It's you, of course.

187
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:32,121
Come on! Come on! Come on!

188
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:33,961
<i>Hello. This is the alien hotline.</i>

189
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,263
Yes. Hi. I've found the alien.

190
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:40,499
<i>They're here, and no weapon can stop them.</i>

191
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,597
You've got to be kidding.

192
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:05,253
<i>- Hello?
- Yes, hello. I've found the alien!</i>

193
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:07,925
<i>If you've spotted an alien fleet, dial 1.</i>

194
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:10,560
<i>For pod people, dial 2.</i>

195
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:17,575
I can breathe! I can breathe!

196
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,205
You speak my language.

197
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:24,582
That's amazing! You speak my language.

198
00:23:25,251 --> 00:23:27,446
Yeah. That's what I just said.

199
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,387
You just said, "That's what I just said."

200
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:33,086
- Say something else.
- Like what?

201
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,459
"Like what."
They're gonna freak back at Kennedy.

202
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:42,532
I'm Captain Charles T. Baker, astronaut.

203
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:46,971
As-tro-nau-t.

204
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,670
- Ass...
- Tro-naut.

205
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,476
Lem.

206
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,444
Lem.

207
00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:00,085
Either your name is Lem,
or you want to mate with me.

208
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:03,487
Houston, we have a little problem.

209
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:07,387
- What do you want?
- Thanks for asking.

210
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:09,793
Coffee, light, two sugars.

211
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:13,423
Do you have any Frappuccino up here?
Any puff pastry, too. Thanks.

212
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:17,128
No, I mean are you here
to take over our world

213
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:20,400
and, like, eat our brains?

214
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,167
Hold on.

215
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:25,608
What kind of sick planet is this?

216
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:28,742
First of all,
it's supposed to be uninhabited, okay?

217
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:31,510
Not full of sea monkeys
dancing to the oldies.

218
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:34,485
My mission was to plant Old Glory,
whack a few golf balls

219
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:38,216
and head back to the Kids' Choice Awards.
I'm getting slimed.

220
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:41,622
- What?
- You were just talking alien.

221
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:43,992
Hey, I'm not the alien here. You are.

222
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:46,497
- Me? You are.
- No, you are.

223
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,931
You are. You... You came to my planet.

224
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:52,600
An alien planet. Hello.

225
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:55,799
- Hello.
- Not, "Hello." "Hello!"

226
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,740
- Hello... What?
- What?

227
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:01,742
Let's start over.

228
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:04,681
Look, there's a command module
in orbit right now.

229
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,774
It's running out of fuel.

230
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,945
It has to leave in 74 hours,
and if I'm not on it,

231
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:12,184
<i>it goes back to Earth without me. Capisce?</i>

232
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,458
I have to get to my ship
and go back up in space.

233
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:18,795
Can you help me?

234
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:21,890
You want me to take you
to your flying saucer? No!

235
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:24,595
If they catch me helping you,
who knows what they'll do to me?

236
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,935
I'll lose everything.
My life was just getting perfect.

237
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,373
Kid... You are a kid, right?

238
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:33,104
I mean, you're not like
a thousand-year-old Yoda or anything?

239
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:36,147
Never mind. Look, kid, you're my only hope.

240
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:40,246
But I suppose you could leave me stranded.

241
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,982
My wife will have to support the kids.

242
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,121
Eleven. We have 11 kids, always hungry.

243
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:50,990
Yeah. Yeah.
But, hey, they'll get by without a father.

244
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:54,829
The important thing here
is you avoid a little trouble.

245
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:58,699
<i>Alien hotline.
What's the nature of your sighting?</i>

246
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:02,306
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

247
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:06,341
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

248
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:16,313
Hey, fella. Who wants a donut?

249
00:26:26,332 --> 00:26:27,822
Silly dog!

250
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:51,616
There's your flying saucer. Now what?

251
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:55,922
Okay, here's the plan.

252
00:26:56,762 --> 00:27:00,528
You knock out that cop,
then you overpower those two.

253
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,827
You neutralize that one

254
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,697
and handcuff the big guy
to the steering wheel.

255
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,465
That's your plan?
What if they start shooting?

256
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:09,200
You're one of their own.
They'll probably just aim for your legs.

257
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:11,708
- My legs?
- Don't your legs grow back?

258
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:14,575
No. We're not like your kind, okay?

259
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:18,382
I'll tell you what, eat this.

260
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,283
- You become invincible.
- Oh, good. Then you do it.

261
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:24,789
I can't be seen breaking the law.
I've got the right stuff.

262
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:26,924
- The what?
- The right stuff.

263
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:28,960
It means I have a lot of courage.

264
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:30,256
Now go!

265
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,592
Go on! Go! Go! Go!

266
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:41,965
Hey, Lem, something wrong?

267
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:48,071
Left flank. Move it! Move it!

268
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:51,173
As you can see,
the army is taking positions,

269
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,480
<i>just like in The War of the Worlds,</i>

270
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:59,320
getting ready for our first close encounter
with invaders from outer space.

271
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:16,500
Attention!

272
00:28:19,812 --> 00:28:21,643
So they've come.

273
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:25,741
- Captain!
- Sir.

274
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:29,881
Have your men search the flying saucer.

275
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:31,946
Yes, sir! Move!

276
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,924
- Hazmat team, go!
- Sir!

277
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:38,554
Now our brave soldiers
are entering the alien spaceship.

278
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:42,056
It doesn't look big enough
to be a space destroyer.

279
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:43,294
It's dark in here.

280
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,003
Hey, look!

281
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,034
No sign of the pilot, sir.

282
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,726
Are you getting...

283
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:24,803
I've never seen such a heinous weapon.

284
00:29:25,244 --> 00:29:27,906
We are up against a cruel, sadistic enemy.

285
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,212
Seal off the town.
I want that alien pilot found.

286
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,075
I protest!

287
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:39,781
<i>They're bumming me out
with their bad vibrations</i>

288
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,788
<i>Well, there's one thing you've gotta do...</i>

289
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:45,887
Never mind, Captain. The alien is right here.

290
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:47,989
- Grab him!
- Yes, sir!

291
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,298
Glar's not the alien!

292
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:52,929
Oh, no? Then what do you call this?

293
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:56,505
- Hair. He likes it long.
- Very unusual.

294
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:59,842
You might even say, very alien!

295
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:04,343
Excuse me! General!
He does go to the high school.

296
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:09,248
Glar's just trying to say
the aliens might be friendly.

297
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:16,884
Lem! Lem, you know astronomy.

298
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:20,258
If an alien came all this way,

299
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:23,634
wouldn't it be smart enough
to come in peace?

300
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:28,237
No! No! No! No! No!

301
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:39,941
I mean, they've come to harvest our organs,
make us slaves.

302
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:41,545
Me?

303
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,447
We should all, all of us,
right now, go home and hide.

304
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:49,293
That's a sensible young man. Let him go.

305
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:54,526
And the rest of you,
go to your homes and wait for instructions.

306
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,297
Hi.

307
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,539
Go back to your homes. Show's over.

308
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,587
Okay, come on, come on.

309
00:31:26,064 --> 00:31:28,328
Hurry up. Go! Go! Go! Go!

310
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,569
Great! Just great!

311
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:35,732
Look, I said I'd take you
to your flying saucer, okay?

312
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:38,469
Well, there it is. Now, leave.

313
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,677
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow
for the night.

314
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,861
It's a miracle I'm gonna need.

315
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:29,486
Oh, you... You like the stone?
You like the stone?

316
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:31,529
Go! Go! Go get it!

317
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,201
There it is! Stop!

318
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,955
Don't move!

319
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:43,258
<i>Aliens are quite like us,
except they have two sets of teeth,</i>

320
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:48,602
<i>hypodermic fingertips and hypnotic eyes
to control our brains</i>

321
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:52,404
<i>and turn us into an army of zombies
and destroy our world.</i>

322
00:33:52,477 --> 00:33:53,501
What?

323
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:58,481
<i>Remember, anyone caught
helping the aliens will go to jail.</i>

324
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,350
Jail? This is great!

325
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:04,813
Yesterday, my life was perfect,

326
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,486
and now, I'm the most wanted
super-criminal in the world.

327
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:12,054
At least you have a world.

328
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:15,390
I'll probably never see mine again.

329
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:50,524
Our preliminary procedures
have been completed, sir.

330
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:52,160
The spacecraft is quarantined.

331
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:55,832
We're looking for a place
for your headquarters, sir, and...

332
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:58,375
Still no trace of the alien, sir.

333
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:01,344
Where would you hide if you were an alien?

334
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,677
Hide? Bravo, General.

335
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:09,186
An alien invader spends over $500
to fly across the universe to hide.

336
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:13,914
You clown!
He's here to take over our minds!

337
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:18,260
- Even yours!
- Diabolical!

338
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,423
Captain, place me under arrest.

339
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:21,659
Not so fast, General.

340
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:25,931
I've trained my superior intellect
to recognize alien mind slaves.

341
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:31,139
You're clean.

342
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:35,305
But he's a zombie, and those two.

343
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:39,473
How will we know who is a zombie?

344
00:35:39,551 --> 00:35:42,281
Well, zombies don't feel any pain.

345
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:47,982
- You're clean.
- You, too.

346
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:52,387
General, you must capture the alien alive
and bring it to me.

347
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:57,033
I will unlock the secrets
of its marvelous brain.

348
00:35:57,636 --> 00:35:59,399
Captain, search the town.

349
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:02,998
Go door to door if you must,
but find that alien.

350
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:18,213
Hello, Plark, if that really is you.

351
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,851
Have a nice day, Serbok,
or should I call you by your alien name?

352
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:28,565
It's you. It's you!

353
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:29,691
It's you!

354
00:36:29,768 --> 00:36:34,262
How come I have to go to the dentist
if it's the end of the world, Mom?

355
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:36,534
Invasion or not, you've got to go.

356
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:39,168
My mom's a zombie! Help!

357
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:45,015
Zombie!

358
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,687
Okay, right, so,
this is the last street we're gonna do today.

359
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:18,342
- Okay, let's start at this end.
- Wait. I think I'm a zombie.

360
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:22,614
I'm hearing an irritating, piercing voice
in the back of my head.

361
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:24,382
- Oh, shut up. It's me.
- It's there again!

362
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:26,219
It's me, you moron.

363
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,591
Hey, what's that?

364
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:44,206
Hey, look.

365
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:48,444
That's funny!

366
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:55,347
Look at it! Look at the dog!

367
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,015
Mom?

368
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:02,991
Mom? Mom! Don't come in!

369
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:13,729
Rover? Boy, am I glad to see you! Rover!

370
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:16,672
Rover?

371
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:20,503
He's a probe we sent
to take pictures of your world.

372
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:25,447
Hey, a planet full of aliens,
and you sent back pictures of rocks?

373
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,877
Bad boy! Bad boy.

374
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:32,683
- Mom, don't come in!
- The alien!

375
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,122
Can I get your autograph?

376
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,992
Eckle, this isn't a comic book, okay?
It's serious.

377
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:42,431
I don't mind.
It comes with being a national hero.

378
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,972
<i>And... And my Humaniacs poster?</i>

379
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:52,436
And my... And my chest?

380
00:38:54,446 --> 00:38:56,471
Hey, how about a snapshot?

381
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,139
Get one of me looking up at the stars.

382
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:01,185
- Mom!
- I saw the alien last night.

383
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,553
I am so in.

384
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:06,681
I got this guy wrapped around
my little finger.

385
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:09,894
Let me tell you, this alien's not so scary.

386
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:16,662
Your personal chef reporting for duty, sir.

387
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:19,397
May I give you some
tasty suggestions for tonight?

388
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:22,668
I've got a list of
the fattest teachers in my school

389
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:24,606
in case you're looking for a light snack.

390
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:27,406
Skiff, stop.
He's not here to eat us or anything.

391
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:29,743
He's harmless to everyone but me.

392
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:31,782
Better let me do the talking.

393
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,580
I think he's eyeing you for dessert.

394
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:39,888
It's kind of cute, the way he does that.

395
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:43,586
Oh, great. Let's just have a party!

396
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:48,499
We're doing a routine search for the alien.

397
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:51,664
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

398
00:39:52,404 --> 00:39:54,395
It's trying to control our minds.

399
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:56,940
- What do we do?
- Don't look in its eyes.

400
00:39:57,008 --> 00:39:59,442
That's how they take over your brain.

401
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:02,036
Brains? That's right, brains!

402
00:40:02,514 --> 00:40:06,109
You are my zombie slaves.

403
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:10,281
- I want to control your brains.
- It's inside my head!

404
00:40:10,355 --> 00:40:12,880
Its will is too strong!

405
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:21,631
<i>Hey, Macarena</i>

406
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:24,497
- Command us, Master.
- Command us, Master.

407
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:28,635
- Command me, too.
- It's not real.

408
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,308
I think I know
when I'm being mind-controlled.

409
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:34,573
Hey, maybe they could get me on my ship.

410
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:40,040
I'm leaning toward "probably not."

411
00:40:42,987 --> 00:40:44,682
<i>... an extensive search.</i>

412
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,950
<i>- But I think I know who can.
- In the meantime at the landing site,</i>

413
00:40:47,025 --> 00:40:51,052
<i>just to the left of me here,
everything is checked and double-checked.</i>

414
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:53,723
<i>The High Command
taking control of the situation...</i>

415
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:57,096
You want our home for your headquarters?

416
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:00,629
Gee, that would be a great honor.

417
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:03,866
Honey, tell Lem we have guests.

418
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:08,143
Lem, there's someone you'd like to...

419
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:19,022
Check the papers.

420
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,456
Kiss the ship goodbye, Rover.

421
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:27,957
You really think you can get me on TV?

422
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,134
You're the biggest story in history.

423
00:41:31,202 --> 00:41:34,035
- The whole planet will watch.
- The whole planet?

424
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:35,595
Interesting.

425
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:39,239
I left my hair products on the ship,
but I could improvise.

426
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,609
You know, astronauts have to deal
with any kind of emergency.

427
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,774
I get it. He can tell everyone he's peaceful.

428
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,648
All we need is a safe place, that TV reporter,

429
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,086
and then we can all get on with our lives.

430
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,680
Skiff, the comic book store, let's go there.

431
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:57,854
Okay, but if he's not housebroken,
you're cleaning up his mess.

432
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:00,424
We need a slogan, like something that says,

433
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:04,491
"It's a bummer to make war on the aliens
when we should make..."

434
00:42:06,004 --> 00:42:08,700
Hey, Neera! Hi! Hi!

435
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:10,866
Kill any aliens, Lem?

436
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:14,105
Oh, no, you don't understand.
These soldiers aren't...

437
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,646
Oh, great! This day gets better and better.

438
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:26,452
General Grawl,
you better take a look at this.

439
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:33,354
Professor, take a look.

440
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:37,062
This is obviously alien writing.

441
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:43,229
It says, "Surrender or die,"

442
00:42:43,808 --> 00:42:47,574
and this is a list of surrender terms.

443
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:50,108
Diabolical.

444
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:53,175
What are you doing in Lem's room?

445
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:57,084
I'm afraid your son is a zombie.

446
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:04,623
- Hey, kid, what's bugging you?
- Neera.

447
00:43:04,696 --> 00:43:08,097
- What is that, like an alien hernia?
- Well, sort of.

448
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:12,899
It's the girl of my dreams,
and now she hates me.

449
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:17,404
Hate's a strong word.
Maybe she just dislikes you.

450
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:20,840
Plus, there's another guy, Glar.

451
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:23,009
Okay. You know your problem?

452
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:26,744
It's not Glar or Neera. It's Lem.

453
00:43:27,185 --> 00:43:29,676
Look at you. You're so left-brain.

454
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:31,722
Or is it right brain? Whatever.

455
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:35,247
You're like the chief of control.
You've got to loosen up.

456
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:38,693
We've got a little time.
You, my friend, are in luck.

457
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:41,288
The doctor is in.

458
00:43:44,102 --> 00:43:46,536
Me and green bean need to talk.

459
00:43:50,475 --> 00:43:53,501
Before we begin, I have a technical question.

460
00:43:53,578 --> 00:43:56,877
Are you considered
very ugly on this planet?

461
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:58,745
- What?
- Because I can't tell.

462
00:43:58,816 --> 00:43:59,874
No.

463
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:03,216
- I mean, I'm okay.
- Oh, good. Good.

464
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:07,989
Why do chicks dig me?

465
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:11,517
Because I'm handsome?
Because I'm an astronaut?

466
00:44:13,865 --> 00:44:15,423
Yes, and yes.

467
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,732
But it's also because
of Chuck Baker's three steps to romance.

468
00:44:20,405 --> 00:44:21,633
Spot your prey.

469
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:24,766
Make your move. Show no mercy.

470
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:28,243
Hey, baby.

471
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:32,207
I saw you across the bar.

472
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:36,583
Are sparks flying or is this place on fire?

473
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:40,821
- You're sure you're not ugly, right?
- I think so.

474
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:44,692
Baby, tomorrow I go up in space,
maybe never to return.

475
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:52,035
Let's make our last night
a night to remember.

476
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:56,131
Lem! The cork!

477
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,898
The cork! Remember the plan!

478
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:03,670
The only plan here is to get Chuck on TV.

479
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:07,843
I'll be right back with the reporter.
I'm leaving you in charge.

480
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:09,443
In charge?

481
00:45:11,556 --> 00:45:12,955
You heard him.

482
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:15,356
Things are going to be
different around here.

483
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:17,417
My wish is your command.

484
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:23,128
Come on, boys, let's track down this story.

485
00:45:23,201 --> 00:45:25,897
We need an alien for the 6:00 news.

486
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:29,798
Wait! Stop! Hey!

487
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:33,567
- We're really upset!
- Yeah.

488
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:36,078
- Upset we really are.
- Yeah.

489
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:38,342
Are we upset, really?

490
00:45:39,484 --> 00:45:42,112
Neera! I need to talk to you.

491
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:44,785
I thought you were after the alien.

492
00:45:44,856 --> 00:45:47,723
- That's not what's going on.
- Then what is?

493
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,251
I...

494
00:45:49,694 --> 00:45:51,889
<i>Mysterious Lem</i>

495
00:45:53,264 --> 00:45:56,392
<i>Tell us the secrets of your heart</i>

496
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:00,770
I can't say.

497
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:04,070
Lem, I always thought we'd be together,

498
00:46:04,142 --> 00:46:07,873
but I need someone who doesn't
always believe what he's been told.

499
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:14,348
It's like Glar says,
"The times, they are a-different."

500
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:16,749
Maybe you should go.

501
00:46:24,095 --> 00:46:27,030
- Hey, baby.
- What?

502
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:28,998
Is this place sparking

503
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:34,026
or is fire making this a night
to show no mercy?

504
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:37,300
Did I happen to mention I'm not ugly?

505
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,534
Are you crazy?

506
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:51,045
Hey, is this guy giving you bad vibrations?

507
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:53,452
Lem was just leaving.

508
00:46:56,394 --> 00:46:58,225
I'm hungry, guys.

509
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:06,395
Are you kidding me?

510
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:09,268
If you have to do a number one,
use these papers.

511
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,070
If you have to do a number two, go outside.

512
00:47:12,143 --> 00:47:15,840
And, if it's number three, I can't help you.

513
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:21,011
Got you, alien! Victory or extinction!

514
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:26,484
Oh, yeah?
In space, no one can hear you scream!

515
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,222
- You missed!
- Crush, kill, destroy.

516
00:47:30,661 --> 00:47:32,561
Crush, kill, destroy.

517
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,722
Hey, Master! We want to be destroyed, too!

518
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:40,661
Quick, cover the camera!

519
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:44,105
If it gets damaged again,
we'll have to pay for it.

520
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,513
You're afraid of a widdle storm.
It's nothing. You see?

521
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:07,926
Rover!

522
00:48:20,544 --> 00:48:21,806
Rover!

523
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:26,373
Sit, Rover! Sit! Stop!
Heel! Roll over! Come back! Listen...

524
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:28,782
You can't escape the tractor beam.

525
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:31,617
It's pulling you to your doom!

526
00:48:39,964 --> 00:48:42,364
6:00 news, here we go.

527
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:52,970
<i>... going on a journey.</i>

528
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:55,802
<i>Soon, we will crush the rebel alliance</i>

529
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,371
<i>and control the galaxy.</i>

530
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:02,449
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

531
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,422
<i>You are a rebel spy
and a traitor to the Empire.</i>

532
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:08,623
<i>Take her away.</i>

533
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:09,887
Skiff!

534
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,657
<i>Hasta la vista, baby. You are terminated.</i>

535
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:20,193
General, over there.
Aren't those comic books?

536
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:22,929
Captain, get your men!

537
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:26,108
We gotta get out of here now!

538
00:49:29,046 --> 00:49:32,140
Move it! Move it! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

539
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,677
Chuck, come on!

540
00:49:37,455 --> 00:49:39,116
- Sorry, pal. Too dangerous.
- But...

541
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,350
Out!

542
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:43,486
You there! Stop!

543
00:49:47,832 --> 00:49:49,800
Don't lose him, sir!

544
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:52,391
Wow!

545
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:03,613
Don't you ever run off like that.

546
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:06,376
What if they took you to the pound?

547
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,475
How would I find you?

548
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:10,412
Lem?

549
00:50:13,758 --> 00:50:15,191
Oh, boy!

550
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,299
We'd better run!

551
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,573
Let's move!

552
00:50:35,946 --> 00:50:38,380
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

553
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:42,716
Move it! Move it! Move it! Go!

554
00:50:50,161 --> 00:50:52,391
Let the doctor handle this.

555
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:56,194
Ladies, who wants to meet an astronaut?

556
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:01,235
- Ladies! One at a time!
- Chuck!

557
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:03,867
I'm on Facebook.

558
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:14,180
Ready?

559
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,690
Look out! The monster!

560
00:51:26,597 --> 00:51:28,326
It's getting away!

561
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:34,101
- Got you!
- Rover? No!

562
00:51:38,943 --> 00:51:41,571
- Quick, hotwire the car!
- What? Hotwire the who?

563
00:51:41,645 --> 00:51:44,705
When are you green goobers
going to evolve?

564
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:15,042
<i>- Attention, all personnel.
- What's the matter?</i>

565
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:17,307
Why did he do it?

566
00:52:17,381 --> 00:52:21,477
I was gonna teach him to beg
and everything.

567
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:30,717
Amazing! The alien's brain is so powerful,
it's controlling them even now.

568
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:33,626
What is it telling you to do?

569
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,600
I think I'm supposed to dig a hive
for the alien queen.

570
00:52:38,669 --> 00:52:41,137
Yeah. I'm supposed to blow up things.

571
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:43,969
- I mean, unless you need help with the hive.
- Oh, no, I'm good.

572
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,303
- You sure?
- I'm good.

573
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:47,640
Never mind them, Professor.

574
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:50,845
This thing has all the answers.

575
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:55,316
Where's your master? Talk!

576
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:02,555
The flying saucer
is going to an undisclosed location

577
00:53:02,626 --> 00:53:04,821
to be taken apart and studied.

578
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:09,298
This reporter is now going to reveal
to you where that location is.

579
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:13,398
This reporter has just been told
that if I do that,

580
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,335
I will be taken apart and studied.

581
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:28,050
Oh, look. That's perfect. That's great.

582
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:30,382
Oh, just great! Perfect!

583
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:34,116
John Glenn goes around the world,
he's a senator for life.

584
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:36,421
I went across the fricking universe!

585
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:38,552
I should be governor, minimum!

586
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:42,793
But, no,
I'm marooned here on this stupid rock!

587
00:53:48,372 --> 00:53:50,863
This stupid rock is my home,

588
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:54,604
or it was until you came along
and ruined everything!

589
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:57,511
I want my life back, unless, I don't know,

590
00:53:57,581 --> 00:53:59,742
maybe there's something else
you want to ruin.

591
00:53:59,817 --> 00:54:01,307
Who's that?

592
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,851
My boss.

593
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:11,890
Sorry, Mr. Hucklo.
It's just for one little night.

594
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:15,989
Maybe a week. I really hope this
doesn't affect our working relationship.

595
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:28,077
Oh, great! Just great! Fired.

596
00:54:28,746 --> 00:54:32,705
Say, why don't you just harvest my organs
and get it over with?

597
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,791
Oh, great. Now look what you did.
You made him really upset.

598
00:54:45,462 --> 00:54:46,554
Lem?

599
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:01,538
Lem?

600
00:55:09,787 --> 00:55:11,687
You're looking right at my home.

601
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:15,116
See that star, the little red one?

602
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:18,621
Circling that star is a planet called Earth.

603
00:55:18,696 --> 00:55:22,598
It's about 20 billion miles away, give or take.

604
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:24,361
There's no way space is that big.

605
00:55:24,435 --> 00:55:26,460
What? Are you kidding?

606
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:31,941
There's billions of galaxies,
and each galaxy has billions of stars.

607
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,713
Next to that, kid,
our planets are just dust in the wind.

608
00:55:38,982 --> 00:55:42,008
So, nothing I knew was right?

609
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:45,820
Come on. You knew about Neera.

610
00:55:46,357 --> 00:55:47,949
I mean, look at her.

611
00:55:48,025 --> 00:55:51,756
Lose the antennae,
get some plastic surgery, she's a hottie.

612
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:54,825
I don't have the right stuff, like you.

613
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:00,163
Kid...

614
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,867
I never had the right stuff.

615
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:11,138
I'm a button pusher, Spam in a can.

616
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:15,446
I don't even fly the ship. It's all automatic.

617
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:20,421
I only got this far on charm
and my rugged good looks.

618
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:26,493
You risked everything
to help a stranger from another world.

619
00:56:27,865 --> 00:56:30,561
You're the one with the right stuff.

620
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:34,197
Get out of here.

621
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:39,641
Finally! We've been looking for you!

622
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:40,904
Guys!

623
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:44,578
Great hiding spot. I call the closet.

624
00:56:44,648 --> 00:56:47,583
No way! Let's go fight the army.

625
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:51,178
How's your species at hiding?
Can you change your skin to this color?

626
00:56:51,255 --> 00:56:55,316
Your call, Captain Baker.
What's it going to be, fight or hide?

627
00:56:56,193 --> 00:56:57,490
Neither.

628
00:56:57,895 --> 00:57:00,125
I think Lem's saying he wants the closet.

629
00:57:00,197 --> 00:57:04,497
I'll tell you what it's going to be.
We're gonna go get Chuck back to his ship.

630
00:57:04,568 --> 00:57:07,969
Skiff, you were right about Base 9.
That's where they have his ship.

631
00:57:08,038 --> 00:57:11,530
- But we don't know where it is.
- Yes, we do.

632
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:15,874
Rover found me.
He's also programmed to find my ship.

633
00:57:16,747 --> 00:57:18,715
Wait, where is Rover?

634
00:57:20,284 --> 00:57:24,311
- It's too painful to talk about.
- It's okay.

635
00:57:24,822 --> 00:57:27,086
They've got him at the comic book shop.

636
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:29,785
Well, then, we've got to go get him.

637
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,761
Hold on.
The whole army's looking for you two.

638
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:34,855
You can't just stroll through town.

639
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:40,530
Wait, wait, that new movie,
doesn't that open tonight?

640
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:42,772
Yeah. Why?

641
00:57:55,052 --> 00:57:59,352
The citizens of Glipforg
are undaunted by alien invaders

642
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:02,859
and are bravely going about
their normal routines.

643
00:58:04,228 --> 00:58:05,490
Got you!

644
00:58:06,964 --> 00:58:09,797
There's the comic book store. Let's go.

645
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:22,469
What great costumes!

646
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:25,572
You two are finalists. Up on stage.

647
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:28,482
We're not here to enter the contest.

648
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:31,680
Then why are you dressed like aliens?

649
00:58:32,656 --> 00:58:36,251
We're here to win the contest.

650
00:58:36,326 --> 00:58:38,487
- What?
- Yeah, good.

651
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:40,189
Trust me. Trust me.

652
00:58:51,642 --> 00:58:53,542
Private, come here.

653
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,150
Hold your fire, soldier.

654
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:06,579
Take us to your leader.

655
00:59:08,025 --> 00:59:12,462
<i>Welcome to
the Humaniacs III Costume Contest.</i>

656
00:59:19,937 --> 00:59:23,737
We're really upset! We're really upset!

657
00:59:24,508 --> 00:59:26,942
Let's hear it for the finalists.

658
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:29,506
What are we supposed to do?

659
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,811
Give them their daily
minimum dose of Chuck.

660
00:59:33,317 --> 00:59:35,410
Hello, Humaniacs!

661
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:58,766
Come on, Lem!

662
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:12,448
Look at me. Watch this.

663
01:00:18,695 --> 01:00:20,390
Yeah! That's it!

664
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,032
Bust a move, green machine.

665
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:44,847
All right!

666
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:54,262
The alien!

667
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:07,971
Lem!

668
01:01:08,612 --> 01:01:10,375
Over here!

669
01:01:11,248 --> 01:01:12,772
There he is!

670
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:21,654
All of these costumes!
Sir, how do we find the alien?

671
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:24,990
Simple, Captain.
Like us, the alien is in uniform.

672
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:28,087
Grab him!

673
01:01:28,165 --> 01:01:30,292
- I got you!
- Chuck!

674
01:01:31,268 --> 01:01:32,997
No! No! Get off!

675
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:36,601
Okay, keep back.

676
01:01:43,613 --> 01:01:44,841
Move.

677
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:55,083
Time to meet the monster face to face.

678
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:05,993
Look at it, Professor. It's hideous.
And that smell...

679
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,835
Hey, you try wearing
the same suit for three weeks.

680
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:14,233
What a remarkable brain you must have.

681
01:02:14,311 --> 01:02:18,975
An incision here and here,
it should pop right out.

682
01:02:22,552 --> 01:02:25,487
No! You're making a mistake! He's friendly!

683
01:02:26,757 --> 01:02:28,452
This poor boy's obviously a zombie.

684
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:30,993
- I'll remove his brain, too.
- What?

685
01:02:44,474 --> 01:02:47,341
You are no longer needed, slave.

686
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:51,811
I release you. Return to your puny life.

687
01:02:52,783 --> 01:02:55,013
Kid, I'm going down anyway.

688
01:02:55,852 --> 01:02:58,582
There's no need for you to come with me.

689
01:02:59,723 --> 01:03:01,714
Thanks for everything.

690
01:03:04,628 --> 01:03:06,619
How about it, Professor?

691
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:09,427
Difficult to tell.

692
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:13,736
Do you still believe the alien is friendly?

693
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:21,809
- No.
- This boy is free!

694
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:27,812
Oh, Lem! We're so glad you're not a zombie!

695
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:30,684
What about the alien spawn, sir?

696
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:34,579
I want it destroyed, one little piece at a time.

697
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:43,489
All right, let's get these aliens to Base 9!

698
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:47,435
Not that it exists.

699
01:03:56,413 --> 01:03:57,744
Move it!

700
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:01,047
Go on.

701
01:04:02,152 --> 01:04:03,551
Get in!

702
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:23,869
<i>We're here to honor
a young man who survived</i>

703
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,876
a harrowing ordeal at the hands
of the alien monster.

704
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:30,075
Lem, come on out!

705
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:32,706
Son?

706
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:43,054
Lem, I understand you'll be working
right here after you graduate,

707
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:45,822
teaching about the mysteries of space.

708
01:04:45,896 --> 01:04:48,729
Give us a preview of what we'll learn.

709
01:04:52,168 --> 01:04:55,399
Well, we know everything
about our universe.

710
01:04:56,106 --> 01:05:00,304
- It's 500 miles long
- 500 miles!

711
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:05,848
- Remarkable!
- I can't.

712
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:10,617
Space isn't 500 miles. It's not.

713
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:13,520
It's so much bigger than we can imagine.

714
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:18,694
There's billions of galaxies,
and each galaxy has billions of stars,

715
01:05:18,762 --> 01:05:21,595
and next to that, our planet is just...

716
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:25,200
<i>Excuse me.</i>

717
01:05:39,783 --> 01:05:40,943
Lem?

718
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:46,418
I know I was kind of harsh. I'm really sorry.

719
01:05:49,192 --> 01:05:50,750
Oh, hi, Neera.

720
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:53,957
- What are you doing?
- It's called hotwiring.

721
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,555
It's how they start cars on Earth.

722
01:05:56,633 --> 01:05:59,796
Lem, I was thinking...

723
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:03,864
Well, you know, now that this is all over...

724
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,966
- Yeah, Neera?
- Maybe we could...

725
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:13,174
Lem, you left everyone hanging!

726
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:17,082
- I'm going to go find Chuck.
- But how?

727
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:20,680
- It's impossible without Rover!
- My little Rovie.

728
01:06:23,326 --> 01:06:26,727
I can still hear his wagging little antenna.

729
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:28,653
Rover?

730
01:06:28,832 --> 01:06:30,356
Rover!

731
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:34,696
Rover! Rover!

732
01:06:35,572 --> 01:06:36,732
You're alive!

733
01:06:36,806 --> 01:06:39,001
But how did you get out?

734
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:44,905
Good going, boy!

735
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:48,212
Rover, Rover, can you find Chuck?
Where's Chuck?

736
01:07:03,299 --> 01:07:05,199
You're going with me?

737
01:07:07,704 --> 01:07:09,171
All right!

738
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,488
Thought you could take over our world?

739
01:07:26,556 --> 01:07:28,751
Your kind knows no decency.

740
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:33,192
- You mean chick magnets?
- No, aliens.

741
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,921
Tell us your invasion plans.

742
01:07:35,999 --> 01:07:38,763
And don't bother taking over my mind.

743
01:07:38,835 --> 01:07:41,929
If you do,
Captain Kisno has orders to shoot me.

744
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:44,068
If you take over Captain Kisno's mind,

745
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,267
Lieutenant Groit has orders to shoot him.

746
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:47,832
If you take over Lieutenant Groit's mind,

747
01:07:47,911 --> 01:07:51,369
Sergeant York will shoot Captain Kisno,
Lieutenant Groit and myself,

748
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:53,211
along with these three soldiers.

749
01:07:53,283 --> 01:07:55,945
Each man has a designated target
in the squad.

750
01:07:56,019 --> 01:07:58,613
Should you succeed
in taking over all our minds,

751
01:07:58,688 --> 01:08:02,522
Corporal Hisk has orders
to electrocute everyone.

752
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:07,894
If this fails, the entire base is rigged to blow
at the touch of a button.

753
01:08:07,964 --> 01:08:11,161
General, sir? Am I supposed to shoot
Hecknavar or Kolski?

754
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:13,498
- I shoot Kolski.
- No. You shoot Meckavoy.

755
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:16,130
- Well, then who shoots Kolski?
- I can shoot myself.

756
01:08:16,206 --> 01:08:18,970
That won't be necessary.
Hecknavar, you shoot Kolski,

757
01:08:19,042 --> 01:08:21,442
Captain Kisno and graze Corporal Hisk.

758
01:08:21,511 --> 01:08:22,808
Yes, sir!

759
01:08:22,879 --> 01:08:24,244
Not yet!

760
01:08:25,715 --> 01:08:26,943
- Drop your weapon!
- You.

761
01:08:27,016 --> 01:08:28,005
No! You first.

762
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:30,552
- You're mine, Hecknavar!
- I'm not taking my eyes off Kisno.

763
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,349
Drop it, dirtbag!

764
01:08:43,733 --> 01:08:45,360
Hold your fire!

765
01:08:54,944 --> 01:08:58,539
Hold your fire!

766
01:09:01,918 --> 01:09:04,853
Captain Kisno, get everyone out of here.

767
01:09:06,856 --> 01:09:09,654
You're not thinking
all this is my fault, right?

768
01:09:09,726 --> 01:09:12,126
All right, if you won't tell us,

769
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:15,257
there's another way
to unlock the secrets of your brain.

770
01:09:15,331 --> 01:09:17,162
Professor Kipple!

771
01:09:19,502 --> 01:09:21,094
He's all yours.

772
01:09:56,306 --> 01:09:58,467
He thinks we've found him.

773
01:10:04,013 --> 01:10:06,243
Hang on, Chuck. We'll find you.

774
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:21,592
There you are.
I was just warming up for you.

775
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:24,995
Now, we'll have that brain out in no time.

776
01:10:25,068 --> 01:10:27,536
You don't want my brain. It's useless.

777
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:32,337
I spent four years at a party school.
Trust me, it's mush.

778
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:38,844
Hello? Anyone here?

779
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:48,418
- Skiff, what are you doing?
- Come on. No one's around.

780
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,755
I'm not going to get caught.

781
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:09,310
Hey! Look, look, look.
I'm paying! I'm paying!

782
01:11:26,996 --> 01:11:29,396
The thing with the...

783
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:33,196
I mean, it just went over the... Wow!

784
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:01,091
Base 9.

785
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:04,865
This is amazing! I was right again!

786
01:12:09,639 --> 01:12:12,301
How do we get in without being seen?

787
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:31,019
<i>Well, I tried to get along
tried to play along happily</i>

788
01:12:31,994 --> 01:12:35,725
<i>But I'm sorry, Officer
Your rules ain't no good for me</i>

789
01:12:37,734 --> 01:12:41,363
<i>There's one thing you've got to do
And that's stick it to the man</i>

790
01:12:41,437 --> 01:12:43,871
<i>Stick it to the, stick it to the...</i>

791
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,532
<i>Stick it to...</i>

792
01:12:49,212 --> 01:12:50,543
Now!

793
01:12:54,384 --> 01:12:55,510
Cool.

794
01:12:58,888 --> 01:13:01,857
I don't suppose
your planet's invented painkillers?

795
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:53,805
Yeah! Good work, Rover!

796
01:14:00,483 --> 01:14:04,317
Guys! This is so Luke Skywalker!

797
01:14:05,788 --> 01:14:08,723
By the way,
you're not brother and sister, right?

798
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:11,954
- How much time is left?
- Just enough.

799
01:14:12,028 --> 01:14:14,963
Rover here will take us right to my ship.

800
01:14:17,099 --> 01:14:19,795
That's a funny place for his antenna.

801
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:24,304
Captain, I want the whole base on red alert!

802
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:25,738
Yes, sir!

803
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:28,174
General, you must save its brain!

804
01:14:28,244 --> 01:14:31,042
I'm more concerned with saving a world.

805
01:14:55,238 --> 01:14:57,934
That professor's a genius.

806
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:01,643
I feel positively effervescent.

807
01:15:01,711 --> 01:15:04,407
In fine fettle. What a salubrious experience!

808
01:15:04,881 --> 01:15:06,610
Well said. Cheers!

809
01:15:34,377 --> 01:15:35,605
My ship!

810
01:15:36,145 --> 01:15:37,806
Way to go, kid!

811
01:15:44,754 --> 01:15:47,154
Step away from the flying saucer!

812
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:51,156
And put your hands in the air.

813
01:16:04,941 --> 01:16:07,273
There was never a chance you'd get away.

814
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:15,443
You'd destroy the whole base
just to get me?

815
01:16:15,518 --> 01:16:18,851
- That is sick!
- Actually, it's kind of flattering.

816
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:22,687
Sick? Sick, young lady, is helping
the enemy of your world.

817
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:27,422
Sick is befriending a creature
that's so completely different.

818
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:31,727
Sick is... Well, look, it's right in front of you!

819
01:16:32,768 --> 01:16:37,535
I'm sorry, Professor. It's too dangerous
to let the alien live another minute.

820
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:42,973
Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop!

821
01:16:43,346 --> 01:16:48,943
General, I know what you're afraid of,
and it's not Chuck.

822
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:52,387
It's not monsters or aliens.

823
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:55,048
It's the unknown.

824
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:01,926
I've spent my whole life running from it,
and I think maybe you have, too,

825
01:17:02,999 --> 01:17:07,333
but I'm telling you,
the unknown isn't something to be afraid of.

826
01:17:08,104 --> 01:17:10,197
It can be your best friend.

827
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:14,174
And just when you think that it means
the end of everything you know,

828
01:17:14,844 --> 01:17:17,813
it's really just the beginning.

829
01:17:20,316 --> 01:17:23,717
<i>Base destruct, two minutes.</i>

830
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,686
What are you looking at? Run!

831
01:17:35,064 --> 01:17:36,554
Take that!

832
01:17:45,174 --> 01:17:47,142
Everyone on board! Let's go!

833
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:51,908
<i>Attention, all personnel.
Evacuate base immediately.</i>

834
01:17:59,822 --> 01:18:02,882
- What are you doing?
- I can't leave him here.

835
01:18:03,426 --> 01:18:06,452
- Why not?
- Because he's got the right stuff.

836
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:33,418
<i>Base destruct, 60 seconds.</i>

837
01:18:40,863 --> 01:18:43,297
- There's no time for autopilot.
- What's the matter now?

838
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:46,493
I'm going to have to pilot this bucket.

839
01:19:06,155 --> 01:19:08,851
<i>Base destruct in 15 seconds.</i>

840
01:19:08,924 --> 01:19:11,654
She is so heavy!

841
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:18,556
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

842
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:25,471
<i>five, four, three, two, one.</i>

843
01:19:32,381 --> 01:19:33,746
Yeah!

844
01:19:57,773 --> 01:20:00,139
You guys should check this out.

845
01:20:26,068 --> 01:20:29,504
- Hey, what do you think?
- Such a big universe.

846
01:20:29,905 --> 01:20:32,499
I am definitely coming back here.

847
01:20:45,421 --> 01:20:47,150
Am I a zombie now?

848
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:51,853
This guy reads too many comic books.

849
01:20:56,932 --> 01:21:00,868
Hey, Neera, now that this is all over,

850
01:21:02,204 --> 01:21:04,195
- would you want to...
- Yes.

851
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:07,071
But you didn't hear what I was gonna...

852
01:21:13,849 --> 01:21:15,077
Gross!

853
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:20,582
Strap in, everyone,
'cause I'm taking you home.

854
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:00,519
Hey, it's Lem!

855
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:05,297
Hi!

856
01:22:06,402 --> 01:22:07,960
The General, too.

857
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,598
The monster!

858
01:22:11,774 --> 01:22:14,038
It's all right, Chief. He's with me.

859
01:22:14,109 --> 01:22:16,669
Soldiers, attention!

860
01:22:16,912 --> 01:22:19,972
There is among us an astronaut.

861
01:22:25,187 --> 01:22:28,679
Captain, thanks for coming back for me.

862
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:30,721
A pleasure, General.

863
01:22:31,694 --> 01:22:35,653
Maybe next time you have guests
you'll throw a better party.

864
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,194
Kid, how would you like to be president

865
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:45,468
of the local
Chuck Baker, Party Maker Fan Club?

866
01:22:47,376 --> 01:22:48,900
Oh, yeah!

867
01:22:48,978 --> 01:22:50,445
Oh, can I join?

868
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:55,676
Be a good boy,
and don't forget to drink your oil.

869
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,954
Rover, you coming?

870
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:04,219
Or do you want to stay here?

871
01:23:06,929 --> 01:23:10,456
Rover! My little bitty boy!

872
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:23,038
Lem, you saved my life.

873
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,680
You saved mine, too.

874
01:23:32,087 --> 01:23:35,887
That was a man hug, just then.
It's very big on my planet.

875
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,251
Hey, take care of this guy, okay?

876
01:23:48,103 --> 01:23:51,402
You're a great planet, and your '50s are fine,

877
01:23:51,473 --> 01:23:54,533
but give me a call when you get to the '60s,

878
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:57,010
'cause that's gonna be fun.

879
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:26,358
Doc, that brain operation was inspired.

880
01:26:27,596 --> 01:26:29,757
You simply must try it.

881
01:26:29,831 --> 01:26:33,665
No, no, no, no! No! No, no.

882
01:26:39,308 --> 01:26:41,173
Oh, no, no, boy. Easy, easy.

883
01:26:41,243 --> 01:26:43,575
Not the tongue. Not the...

884
01:26:46,548 --> 01:26:48,948
This is gonna be a long trip.
