00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:42.042
<i>When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,</i>

2
00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.087
<i>with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,</i>

3
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.382
<i>I started having these dreams of flying.</i>

4
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:51.051
<i>I was free.</i>

5
00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:57.891
<i>Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.</i>

6
00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:10.612
<i>They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,</i>

7
00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:13.448
<i>but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.</i>

8
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.661
<i>A VA check and 12 bucks
will get you a cup of coffee.</i>

9
00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:20.539
<i>I'm what they call... wait listed.</i>

10
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:30.915
<i>The Bengal Tiger,</i>

11
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.052
<i>extinct for over a century
is making a comeback.</i>

12
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.471
<i>These cloned tiger cubs
at the Beijing Zoo</i>

13
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.390
<i>are the latest of a number of species</i>

14
00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:42.311
<i>that have been cloned back
into existence in the past five years.</i>

15
00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:45.105
<i>I became a marine
for the hardship.</i>

16
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.566
<i>To be hammered on the anvil of life.</i>

17
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.487
<i>I told myself I can pass
any test a man can pass.</i>

18
00:01:55.198 --> 00:02:00.621
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

19
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:02.998
Oh!

20
00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:06.251
<i>Let's get it straight, upfront.</i>

21
00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.045
<i>I don't want yourpity.</i>

22
00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:12.299
<i>You want a fair deal,
you're on the wrong planet.</i>

23
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.972
<i>The strong prey on the weak.</i>

24
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.141
<i>That's just the way things are.</i>

25
00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:24.436
<i>And nobody does a damn thing.</i>

26
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.997
Get off! Get off of him!

27
00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.042
<i>All I ever wanted
in my sorry-ass life</i>

28
00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.252
<i>was a single thing worth fighting for.</i>

29
00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.645
I hope you realized
you just lost yourself a customer.

30
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.606
Candy-ass bitch.

31
00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.778
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.

32
00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.627
- It doesn't look like him.
- It's him.

33
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:31.962
You Jake Sully?

34
00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.923
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

35
00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.509
It's about your brother.

36
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.601
We're looking for Sully, T.

37
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.563
In there.

38
00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.088
Jesus, Tommy.

39
00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.716
<i>The strong prey on the weak.</i>

40
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.011
<i>A guy with a knife took
all Tommy would ever be</i>

41
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.263
<i>for the paper in his wallet.</i>

42
00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:27.267
<i>The concern of the suits was touching.</i>

43
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.188
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

44
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.857
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

45
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.067
And since your genome
is identical to his,

46
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.278
you could step into his shoes,

47
00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.906
so to speak.

48
00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.576
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

49
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.538
You could do something important.
You can make a difference.

50
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:55.712
And the pay is good.

51
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:57.672
Very good.

52
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.467
<i>Tommy was the scientist, not me.</i>

53
00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:03.616
<i>He was the one who wanted
to get shot light-years out in space</i>

54
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:04.888
<i>to find the answers.</i>

55
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.686
<i>Me, I was just another dumb grunt</i>

56
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.730
<i>getting sent someplace
he was gonna regret.</i>

57
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.014
<i>In cryo, you don't dream at all.</i>

58
00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.892
<i>It doesn't feel like six years.</i>

59
00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.728
<i>More like a fifth of tequila
and an ass-kicking.</i>

60
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.577
Are we there yet?

61
00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.954
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

62
00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:12.956
We're there.

63
00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:17.460
You've been in cryo
for five years, nine months and 22 days.

64
00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:20.755
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

65
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:25.844
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks
provided for your convenience.

66
00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:27.971
The staff thanks you in advance.

67
00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:45.322
<i>Up ahead was Pandora.</i>

68
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:50.035
<i>You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.</i>

69
00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.848
<i>Valkyrie 1-6, copy...</i>

70
00:07:11.932 --> 00:07:15.560
<i>Valkyrie 1-6, you are
clear for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.</i>

71
00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:20.231
Copy, <i>Venture Star.</i>
Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

72
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.086
Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!

73
00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.671
Exo-packs on! Let's go!

74
00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.190
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

75
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:47.884
you're unconscious in
20 seconds, you're dead in four minutes!

76
00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:49.469
Let's nobody be dead today!

77
00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.304
Looks very bad on my report.

78
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.767
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1 -6 on approach.

79
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.727
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

80
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.397
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

81
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.942
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

82
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:49.988
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

83
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.657
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

84
00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:03.084
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

85
00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.263
<i>There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine.</i>

86
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:19.350
<i>You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.</i>

87
00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.989
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

88
00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.699
Well, well, ladies.

89
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.912
Look at all this fresh meat! Whoo!

90
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.879
<i>Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,</i>

91
00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.506
<i>fighting for freedom.</i>

92
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.722
<i>Look out, hot rod!</i>

93
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.059
<i>But out here
they're just hired guns,</i>

94
00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.978
<i>taking the money,
working for the company.</i>

95
00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.188
Check this out, man.

96
00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.315
Meals on wheels.

97
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.819
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

98
00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:12.782
I got two guys
free in about 20 minutes!

99
00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:15.323
Got it! Need them!

100
00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:26.793
<i>You're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

101
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.091
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

102
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:36.928
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

103
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.807
If there is a hell,

104
00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:46.187
you might want to go there
for some R&R after a tour on Pandora.

105
00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:48.648
Out there, beyond that fence,

106
00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:53.611
every living thing that crawls,
flies or squats in the mud

107
00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.865
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

108
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:02.871
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

109
00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:05.957
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

110
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.668
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

111
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:13.256
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

112
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.717
They are very hard to kill.

113
00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:21.180
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

114
00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.893
I will not succeed.

115
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:28.563
Not with all of you.

116
00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.107
If you wish to survive,

117
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:34.444
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

118
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:37.572
You've got to obey the rules.

119
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:40.366
Pandora rules.

120
00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.328
Rule number one...

121
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.097
<i>There's nothing like
an old-school safety brief</i>

122
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.873
<i>to put your mind at ease.</i>

123
00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.669
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!

124
00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:54.505
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

125
00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.675
You look just like him.

126
00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.719
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.

127
00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:01.512
I went through avatar training with him.

128
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.598
...into the bio-lab.

129
00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:05.867
We're gonna spend
a lot of time up here.

130
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.853
Hey! How you doing?
Norm, avatar driver.

131
00:12:08.937 --> 00:12:10.188
- Hi.
- Hey.

132
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.916
Link...
Here's the link room right here.

133
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.233
This is where we're connecting
to the avatar.

134
00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:18.071
<i>Me and Norm are here to drive</i>

135
00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.366
<i>these remotely controlled
bodies called avatars.</i>

136
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:26.454
<i>And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.</i>

137
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.498
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

138
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.208
Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.

139
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.837
Damn! They got big.

140
00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.465
Yeah, they fully mature
on the flight out.

141
00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.801
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

142
00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.844
Yeah, they've got
great muscle tone.

143
00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:43.768
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

144
00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:45.807
but you guys
can take them out tomorrow.

145
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.475
There's yours.

146
00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.396
- Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.
- Dr. Max Patel.

147
00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.415
- Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

148
00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.757
Looks like him.

149
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:22.427
No, it looks like you.

150
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.263
This is your avatar now, Jake.

151
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:33.104
<i>And the concept is that
every driver is matched to his own avatar,</i>

152
00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:36.190
so that their nervous systems
are in tune...

153
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:38.484
or something.

154
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:44.574
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

155
00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:47.493
which is insanely expensive.

156
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:51.706
Is this right? I just say
whatever to the video log?

157
00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.018
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

158
00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.085
You know, what we see, what we feel.

159
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:57.312
It's all part of the science.

160
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:58.880
And good science is good observation.

161
00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:01.549
Plus, it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

162
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:04.260
All right. Whatever.

163
00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.013
So...

164
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:09.932
Well, here I am...

165
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.062
doing science.

166
00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.105
They're coming out!

167
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:18.483
<i>Attention.
Drivers coming out of link.</i>

168
00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.325
Oh, God.

169
00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.387
Where's the lab coat?

170
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:31.412
Where's the lab coat?

171
00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:33.414
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?

172
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:37.627
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

173
00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.004
Thank you!

174
00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:41.881
<i>Grace Augustine is a legend.</i>

175
00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:43.674
She's the head of the Avatar Program.

176
00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:45.051
She wrote the book, I mean,

177
00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:47.553
literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

178
00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:49.972
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

179
00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.350
Here she is,
Cinderella back from the ball.

180
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:56.104
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

181
00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.233
Norm. I hear good things about you.

182
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:01.317
How's your Na'vi?

183
00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:04.904
May the All Mother...

184
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.115
...smile upon our first meeting.

185
00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:10.326
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

186
00:15:11.619 --> 00:15:13.788
I studied for five years...

187
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.998
...but there is much to learn.

188
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:18.668
Grace?
This is Jake Sully.

189
00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:19.794
Ma'am.

190
00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:21.754
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,

191
00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.881
and I don't need you.
I need your brother.

192
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:27.969
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

193
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.137
He's dead.

194
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:32.140
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

195
00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:35.309
How much lab training have you had?

196
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:36.936
I dissected a frog once.

197
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.981
You see? You see?

198
00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:41.440
I mean, they're just pissing on us

199
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.693
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

200
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:45.170
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

201
00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:46.255
I don't think that's a good idea.

202
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.738
No, man, this is such bullshit!

203
00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:49.448
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

204
00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:52.118
He has no business
sticking his nose in my department.

205
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.998
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

206
00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:09.427
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

207
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.388
Hover taxi, Delta runway.
Squawk ident.

208
00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.395
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

209
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.647
No, you didn't. You were
looking at the monitor.

210
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:24.650
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

211
00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:31.741
Parker, you know, I used to think
it was benign neglect,

212
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.619
but now I see that
you're intentionally screwing me.

213
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:38.247
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

214
00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.084
Oops.

215
00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.005
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

216
00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:48.007
Well, actually, I thought
we got lucky with him.

217
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.592
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

218
00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:51.636
How is this in any way lucky?

219
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:53.471
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

220
00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:56.807
and lucky that brother
wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

221
00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.559
A Marine we can use.

222
00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:00.537
I'm assigning him to your team
as security escort.

223
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:04.148
The last thing I need
is another trigger-happy moron out there!

224
00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:06.043
Look, look, you're supposed
to be winning the hearts

225
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.169
and the minds of the natives.

226
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.129
Isn't that the whole point
of your little puppet show?

227
00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:10.672
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

228
00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.281
then they'll start trusting us.

229
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:14.450
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

230
00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.452
but after, what, how many years?

231
00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.222
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

232
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:20.873
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

233
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.167
Right. Come here.

234
00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.170
I can't... I can't...

235
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.677
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

236
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.930
Because this little gray rock
sells for 20 million a kilo.

237
00:17:36.013 --> 00:17:37.473
That's the only reason.

238
00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.100
It's what pays for the whole party.

239
00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:41.185
It's what pays for your science.

240
00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:42.520
<i>Comprendo?</i>

241
00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:45.690
Now, those savages
are threatening our whole operation,

242
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.024
we're on the brink of war,

243
00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:50.361
and you're supposed to be
finding a diplomatic solution.

244
00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:53.572
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

245
00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.336
So, how much link time have you logged?

246
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.547
About 520 hours.

247
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.631
That's good.

248
00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.884
You're in there. You're here.

249
00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.511
How much have you logged?

250
00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:18.097
Zip. But I read a manual.

251
00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:20.349
Tell me you're joking.

252
00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:24.145
This is cool.

253
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.438
Let's go.

254
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.485
Don't. I got this.

255
00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:37.992
So you just figured
you'd come out here,

256
00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.953
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

257
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.665
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

258
00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.542
What was going through your head?

259
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.795
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

260
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.631
Biometrics are good.

261
00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:53.841
Link three is ready.

262
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.926
Keep your arms in, hands in,

263
00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:58.471
head down.

264
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:00.431
Down.

265
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.309
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

266
00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:05.519
That shouldn't be hard for you.

267
00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:07.855
Kiss the darkest
part of my lily white...

268
00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:09.148
Initiate link.

269
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:12.610
Run sequence unit three. Go.

270
00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:13.694
Launching.

271
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.160
I have the first congruency.

272
00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:32.046
That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.

273
00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:34.632
Go figure.

274
00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:36.759
Phase-lock 40%.

275
00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.223
All right. Going in.

276
00:19:43.391 --> 00:19:44.809
I'm going in in four.

277
00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:50.272
Phase-lock 99%. Link is stable.

278
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:09.166
He's in.
Jake, can you hear me?

279
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.459
Can you hear me, Jake?

280
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:12.878
Pupillary reflex is good.

281
00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:18.259
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

282
00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:20.344
Hey, guys.

283
00:20:20.928 --> 00:20:22.721
Welcome
to your new body, Jake.

284
00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:24.557
Good!

285
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.326
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

286
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.661
And touch your thumb to your fingers.

287
00:20:27.685 --> 00:20:28.686
Yeah.

288
00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.122
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

289
00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:31.790
That's good. I can see
you can remember that one.

290
00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:32.815
Got it.

291
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.608
Well, if you want to sit up, that's fine.

292
00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:36.628
Okay, good. Just take it
nice and slow, Jake. Good.

293
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.404
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia,
that's good.

294
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.132
Are you feeling lightheaded
or dizzy at all?

295
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.925
You're wiggling your toes!

296
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.885
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

297
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:48.622
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

298
00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.749
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

299
00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:52.960
That's great, Jake.

300
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.271
Hold on, now.

301
00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.175
Take it easy. Don't get ahead
of yourself, okay?

302
00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.007
There's a few more
sensory motor reflex tests

303
00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.633
we need to run, so take it easy.

304
00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:01.177
Ooh! Wait.

305
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.261
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

306
00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:03.554
Jake! Listen to me.

307
00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.181
Jake!

308
00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:06.932
I need you to sit down. Jake!

309
00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:08.160
- It's okay.
- Buddy, listen to me.

310
00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.244
It's all good. I got this.

311
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.187
Jake, you need
to sit down right now.

312
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.855
Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

313
00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.000
Listen to me. For your own safety,
you need to sit down.

314
00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:16.609
You need time
to adjust to the avatar...

315
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:17.985
Jake!

316
00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:19.948
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

317
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.323
Sedate! Sedate him!

318
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:24.492
A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

319
00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.952
Guys! Guys!

320
00:21:27.036 --> 00:21:28.096
<i>By the numbers.</i>

321
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.514
<i>- Jake. Come on.</i>
- Jake! Listen to me.

322
00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:30.974
You're not used to your avatar body.

323
00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:32.875
<i>- This is dangerous.</i>
- This is great.

324
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.043
<i>- Jake?</i>
- Come on.

325
00:21:34.126 --> 00:21:36.420
- They're gonna put you out.
<i>- Jake, listen to me.</i>

326
00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:39.882
Norm, sit down.

327
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:41.318
No, no, no. I gotta get
out of these leads.

328
00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:43.135
God damn it! Bring them home!

329
00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:44.345
Norm! Do not leave control!

330
00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:45.908
You're not ready for it!

331
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:50.017
Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.

332
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.477
Oh! Oh! So close!

333
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.312
I don't even
have to play defense on it.

334
00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:54.789
Hey, guys. Hey.

335
00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:55.999
It's okay, I'll get him.

336
00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:57.143
Jake, you have to come back!

337
00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:59.109
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

338
00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:03.030
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

339
00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:04.156
Come on!

340
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:08.661
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

341
00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:19.421
Jeez! Sorry.

342
00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:20.589
<i>Watch it!</i>

343
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:43.904
Hey, Marine!

344
00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.240
Damn.

345
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.368
Grace?

346
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.829
Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

347
00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:54.039
Think fast.

348
00:22:55.416 --> 00:22:56.959
Motor control's looking good.

349
00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:09.346
Come on, everybody, quiet down!

350
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.807
All right, gang, lights out.

351
00:23:12.474 --> 00:23:13.976
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

352
00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.144
Hey, hey, hey!

353
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:18.272
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

354
00:23:18.355 --> 00:23:20.024
That's kind of freaky.

355
00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:22.276
Come on. Scat.

356
00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:24.570
Good night.

357
00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:29.283
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

358
00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.642
Welcome back.

359
00:24:02.608 --> 00:24:03.734
You okay? You all right?

360
00:24:03.817 --> 00:24:05.027
Yeah, I'm okay.

361
00:24:06.654 --> 00:24:09.782
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.

362
00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:11.492
And this here is my baby.

363
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:13.744
Hold on a second.

364
00:24:14.703 --> 00:24:17.206
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

365
00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.249
We bounce at 0-9.

366
00:24:19.333 --> 00:24:21.335
Yeah, I'm on it, <i>capitaine!</i>

367
00:24:22.878 --> 00:24:24.838
Vine strike's still loose.

368
00:24:24.922 --> 00:24:27.091
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

369
00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.175
Watch it!

370
00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:30.570
Yeah, that's 'cause
we're not the only thing

371
00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:32.846
flying around out there. Or the biggest.

372
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:35.265
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.

373
00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:36.517
I'm a man short.

374
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.560
I thought you'd never ask.

375
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.021
There's your man.

376
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:43.107
See you on the flight line.

377
00:24:53.659 --> 00:24:55.119
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

378
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.205
This low gravity'll make you soft.

379
00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:01.709
You get soft...

380
00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:08.006
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

381
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:11.009
I pulled your record, Corporal.

382
00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:14.388
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

383
00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:18.058
Nothing like this here, though.

384
00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:23.647
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

385
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:26.066
I figured it's just another hellhole.

386
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.026
I was First Recon myself.

387
00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:32.072
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

388
00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:35.951
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

389
00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.536
I come out here?

390
00:25:38.287 --> 00:25:41.540
Day one. Think I felt
like a shave tail Louie?

391
00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:42.750
Yeah.

392
00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:46.044
Oh, they could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

393
00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:49.131
And make me pretty again.

394
00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.967
But you know what? I kind of like it.

395
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.303
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

396
00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:56.889
Hup!

397
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:59.224
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.

398
00:25:59.308 --> 00:26:02.811
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

399
00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:09.818
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

400
00:26:09.902 --> 00:26:11.570
- Clear!
- Clear!

401
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.120
A recon gyrene
in an avatar body.

402
00:26:20.204 --> 00:26:21.872
That's a potent mix.

403
00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:23.624
Give me the goose bumps.

404
00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:28.712
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need, right on the ground.

405
00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:31.548
Right in the hostiles' camp.

406
00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:34.176
Look, Sully.

407
00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:38.263
I want you to learn
these savages from the inside.

408
00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:39.765
I want you to gain their trust.

409
00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:41.858
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

410
00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:44.144
or hammer them hard if they won't.

411
00:26:45.938 --> 00:26:47.022
Am I still with Augustine?

412
00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.190
On paper.

413
00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.901
Yeah, you walk like
one of her science pukes,

414
00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:52.444
you quack like one,

415
00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:55.531
but you report to me.

416
00:26:56.949 --> 00:26:58.069
Can you do that for me, son?

417
00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.453
Hell, yeah, sir.

418
00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:03.914
Well, all right, then.

419
00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:18.178
Son, I take care of my own.

420
00:27:18.262 --> 00:27:19.471
You get me what I need,

421
00:27:19.555 --> 00:27:22.558
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

422
00:27:23.684 --> 00:27:25.185
Your real legs.

423
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:29.356
That sounds real good, sir.

424
00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:37.948
Link's ready!

425
00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:39.408
Phase-lock 40%.

426
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.953
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

427
00:27:43.036 --> 00:27:44.472
I have five congruencies.

428
00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:45.914
Phase-lock 90%.

429
00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:48.041
Link three ready.

430
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.419
All right, I'm going in.

431
00:28:22.326 --> 00:28:24.745
Sturmbeest herd coming up on your right.

432
00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:26.455
Got it! Thanks.

433
00:28:27.664 --> 00:28:31.043
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows
and some juveniles.

434
00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:21.218
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

435
00:29:24.972 --> 00:29:27.182
Norm! Your pack.

436
00:29:27.641 --> 00:29:28.767
Pack.

437
00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:32.229
Stay with the ship.

438
00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:34.815
One idiot with a gun is enough.

439
00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:38.986
You the man, Doc.

440
00:30:16.106 --> 00:30:19.192
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

441
00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:25.157
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

442
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:33.331
So, how will they know we're here?

443
00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:36.042
I'm sure
they're watching us right now.

444
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.174
This was our school.

445
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:44.634
Now it's just... storage.

446
00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:47.429
The kids were so bright.

447
00:30:49.097 --> 00:30:50.348
Eager to learn.

448
00:30:50.432 --> 00:30:52.768
They picked up English
faster than I could teach it.

449
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:57.481
So, we'll take a couple of
these Ph monitors...

450
00:30:57.564 --> 00:30:59.483
...and a soil probe.

451
00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:04.988
That little yellow case back there.
The old microscope.

452
00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:07.073
Here.

453
00:31:07.157 --> 00:31:08.658
Oh, yeah. I love this one.

454
00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:10.869
The stingbats knocked them down.

455
00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:22.464
I keep hoping someone will
come back in and read them.

456
00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:24.049
Why don't they come back?

457
00:31:25.926 --> 00:31:30.639
The Omaticaya... learned as much
about us as they needed to.

458
00:31:37.229 --> 00:31:38.230
What happened here?

459
00:31:42.526 --> 00:31:45.612
Are you going to help us with this gear?
We've got a lot to do.

460
00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:02.003
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

461
00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:07.467
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

462
00:32:10.512 --> 00:32:13.557
Oh! It's that fast?

463
00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:17.936
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

464
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:21.773
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

465
00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:25.652
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

466
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:27.362
Okay. Sample.

467
00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:33.410
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

468
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:37.747
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

469
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.875
Right.

470
00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.155
So, here I go.

471
00:33:35.722 --> 00:33:39.309
Don't shoot. Don't shoot,
you'll piss him off.

472
00:33:43.313 --> 00:33:45.065
It's already pissed off.

473
00:33:45.148 --> 00:33:46.816
Jake, that armor's too thick.

474
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.984
Trust me.

475
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:55.259
It's a territorial threat display.

476
00:33:55.283 --> 00:33:57.619
Do not run, or he'll charge.

477
00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:00.497
So, what do I do, dance with it?

478
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.333
Just hold your ground.

479
00:34:19.015 --> 00:34:21.393
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

480
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.479
Oh, yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

481
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.273
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about, bitch.

482
00:34:29.442 --> 00:34:31.736
That's right, get your
punk ass back to mommy.

483
00:34:32.112 --> 00:34:34.864
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

484
00:34:34.948 --> 00:34:37.218
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

485
00:34:39.828 --> 00:34:41.997
Oh, shit.

486
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.302
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

487
00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.931
Run! Definitely run!

488
00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:48.034
<i>I'm gonna have to call it, guys.</i>

489
00:38:48.117 --> 00:38:49.428
We're not allowed to run night ops.

490
00:38:49.452 --> 00:38:50.995
Colonel's orders.

491
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.291
<i>I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna
have to hang on till morning.</i>

492
00:38:55.959 --> 00:38:57.585
He won't make it till morning.

493
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:52.116
I don't have all goddamn night.

494
00:40:53.368 --> 00:40:55.244
Come on! Come on!

495
00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:10.736
Hey, wait. Don't!

496
00:42:14.407 --> 00:42:15.533
Great.

497
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.636
Look, I know you probably
don't understand this...

498
00:43:16.719 --> 00:43:18.846
...but...

499
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.809
...thank you.

500
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:30.107
Thank you.

501
00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.821
That was pretty impressive.

502
00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:39.575
I would have been screwed

503
00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:41.661
if you hadn't come along.
It was...

504
00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:47.792
Hey, wait a second.
Hey, where you going?

505
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.336
Wait up!

506
00:43:51.504 --> 00:43:53.297
Just... Hey, slow down.

507
00:43:53.381 --> 00:43:54.900
Look, wait up,
I just wanted to say thanks

508
00:43:54.924 --> 00:43:56.175
for killing those things.

509
00:43:57.635 --> 00:43:58.636
Damn!

510
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:00.471
Don't thank.

511
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.849
You don't thank for this.

512
00:44:05.434 --> 00:44:09.355
This is sad. Very sad only.

513
00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:11.983
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

514
00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:14.860
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

515
00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:21.784
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

516
00:44:22.535 --> 00:44:24.662
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

517
00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:26.581
- Your fault!
- Ay!

518
00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:27.832
Your fault!

519
00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:29.584
Shh. Easy. Easy.

520
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.876
You're like a baby.

521
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.421
Making noise, don't know what to do.

522
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:34.964
Easy. Shh.

523
00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:38.884
Fine. Fine.

524
00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:42.597
If you love your little forest friends,

525
00:44:44.473 --> 00:44:46.309
why not let them just kill my ass?

526
00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:48.352
What's the thinking?

527
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:50.855
Why save you?

528
00:44:50.938 --> 00:44:52.189
Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

529
00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:58.404
You have a strong heart.

530
00:45:01.032 --> 00:45:02.033
No fear.

531
00:45:06.746 --> 00:45:09.582
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

532
00:45:16.005 --> 00:45:18.424
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

533
00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:21.302
Look, maybe you should teach me.

534
00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:23.596
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

535
00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:25.514
Well, then teach me how to See.

536
00:45:25.598 --> 00:45:27.224
No one can teach you to See.

537
00:45:29.435 --> 00:45:31.937
Look, come on, can't we talk?

538
00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:34.899
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?

539
00:45:34.982 --> 00:45:36.776
Dr. Augustine's school?

540
00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:43.282
You're like a baby.

541
00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:50.748
I need your help.

542
00:45:52.124 --> 00:45:54.043
You should not be here.

543
00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:56.087
Okay, take me with you.

544
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.922
No! Go back.

545
00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:01.884
No.

546
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.261
Go back.

547
00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:27.076
No!

548
00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:49.932
What...

549
00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:54.895
What are they?

550
00:46:56.522 --> 00:46:58.232
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

551
00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:01.235
Very pure spirits.

552
00:47:03.696 --> 00:47:04.739
Huh.

553
00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:26.469
What was that all about?

554
00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:30.514
Come.

555
00:47:31.932 --> 00:47:33.058
Come!

556
00:47:35.269 --> 00:47:36.604
Where are we going?

557
00:47:46.989 --> 00:47:48.115
Come.

558
00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:04.798
What's your name?

559
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:05.883
Shit!

560
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:38.415
Calm, people. Calm.

561
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:46.966
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

562
00:48:49.468 --> 00:48:52.429
These demons are forbidden here.

563
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.432
There has been a sign.

564
00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:57.851
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

565
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:03.732
Bring him.

566
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:06.269
What's going on?

567
00:49:09.154 --> 00:49:10.239
Wait.

568
00:49:13.117 --> 00:49:14.285
What's happening?

569
00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:16.620
Hey!

570
00:50:26.607 --> 00:50:27.691
Father...

571
00:50:29.068 --> 00:50:30.861
...I see you.

572
00:50:42.581 --> 00:50:44.041
This creature...

573
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:47.419
...why do you bring him here?

574
00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:50.214
I was going to kill him...

575
00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:52.341
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

576
00:50:52.508 --> 00:50:54.510
I have said...

577
00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:56.929
...no dream walker will come here.

578
00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:58.156
What's he saying?

579
00:50:59.264 --> 00:51:01.284
His alien smell fills my nose.

580
00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:02.410
Hey, what's he saying?

581
00:51:02.434 --> 00:51:04.853
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

582
00:51:06.522 --> 00:51:07.606
Your father.

583
00:51:08.482 --> 00:51:09.650
It's nice to meet you, sir.

584
00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:14.655
Step back!

585
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:20.202
I will look at this alien.

586
00:51:20.285 --> 00:51:22.788
That is Mother.
She is <i>Tsahik.</i>

587
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.791
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

588
00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:27.751
Who's Eywa?

589
00:51:34.675 --> 00:51:36.176
What are you called?

590
00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:38.721
Jake Sully.

591
00:51:48.647 --> 00:51:49.857
Why did you come to us?

592
00:51:50.566 --> 00:51:51.775
I came to learn.

593
00:51:52.818 --> 00:51:55.779
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

594
00:51:55.863 --> 00:51:59.241
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

595
00:52:00.659 --> 00:52:02.995
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

596
00:52:04.246 --> 00:52:06.915
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

597
00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:08.167
What are you?

598
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:12.004
I was a Marine.

599
00:52:13.338 --> 00:52:14.715
A...

600
00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:17.009
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

601
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:19.178
A warrior!

602
00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:20.763
I could kill him easily!

603
00:52:20.846 --> 00:52:22.097
No!

604
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:26.685
This is the first warrior dream walker...

605
00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:28.645
...we have seen.

606
00:52:28.729 --> 00:52:31.607
We need to learn more about him.

607
00:52:34.026 --> 00:52:35.903
My Daughter...

608
00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:40.282
...you will teach him our way...

609
00:52:40.365 --> 00:52:43.744
...to speak and walk as we do.

610
00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:46.705
Why me? That's not fair...

611
00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:49.416
It is decided.

612
00:52:50.459 --> 00:52:52.336
My daughter will teach you our ways.

613
00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:56.006
Learn well, Jakesully.

614
00:52:56.799 --> 00:53:00.844
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

615
00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:20.823
Good... Good evening.

616
00:53:23.826 --> 00:53:25.285
Please don't get up.

617
00:53:27.496 --> 00:53:28.622
Excuse me.

618
00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:31.750
Sorry.

619
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.630
Hey, how you doing?

620
00:53:45.639 --> 00:53:46.640
Thank you.

621
00:53:49.184 --> 00:53:51.603
You know, I don't even know your name.

622
00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:54.690
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

623
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:58.944
Again, a whole lot slower?

624
00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:00.153
Neytiri.

625
00:54:00.237 --> 00:54:01.488
Neytili.

626
00:54:02.197 --> 00:54:04.157
Neytiri.

627
00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.909
Neytiri.

628
00:54:07.619 --> 00:54:09.371
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.

629
00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:11.373
It's nice.

630
00:54:54.333 --> 00:54:56.543
<i>Jake. Jake!</i>

631
00:54:56.627 --> 00:54:58.378
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake.

632
00:54:59.087 --> 00:55:00.130
Jake!

633
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:04.343
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

634
00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:08.972
There you go. There you go, there you go.

635
00:55:09.056 --> 00:55:11.308
You're okay. You're okay.

636
00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:14.144
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

637
00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:19.149
Is the avatar safe?

638
00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:21.109
Yeah, Doc.

639
00:55:21.193 --> 00:55:23.362
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

640
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.949
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

641
00:55:28.033 --> 00:55:29.409
disappearing into the brush

642
00:55:29.493 --> 00:55:31.578
with this angry than at or
coming after him.

643
00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:33.747
Hey, it's not something you can teach.

644
00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.165
That is awesome.

645
00:55:35.248 --> 00:55:37.626
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

646
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:40.671
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

647
00:55:42.422 --> 00:55:44.341
"Jarhead clan?"

648
00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:46.343
And it worked?

649
00:55:47.302 --> 00:55:48.845
Hey, I'm practically family.

650
00:55:49.596 --> 00:55:50.722
They're gonna study me.

651
00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:53.016
I have to learn to be one of them.

652
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.494
That's called taking the initiative, son.

653
00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:56.061
I wish I had 10 more like you.

654
00:55:56.144 --> 00:55:57.312
Look, Sully. Sully.

655
00:55:57.396 --> 00:56:00.816
Just find out what
the blue monkeys want.

656
00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:07.364
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

657
00:56:07.447 --> 00:56:09.241
But no, no, no, they like mud.

658
00:56:09.324 --> 00:56:13.286
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're...

659
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.872
Hey, can you... Can somebody just...

660
00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:17.040
Sector 12.

661
00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:21.878
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

662
00:56:21.962 --> 00:56:23.463
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

663
00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:26.967
Their damn village happens to be resting

664
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:33.098
on the richest unobtanium deposit
within 200 klicks in any direction.

665
00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:35.726
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

666
00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:40.772
Well, who gets them to move?

667
00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:42.399
Guess.

668
00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:44.901
What if they won't go?

669
00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:47.779
Oh, I'm betting that they will.

670
00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:50.407
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey.
Look. Look.

671
00:56:51.324 --> 00:56:53.285
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

672
00:56:54.327 --> 00:56:58.081
but there's one thing that
shareholders hate more than bad press,

673
00:56:58.165 --> 00:56:59.958
and that's a bad quarterly statement.

674
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:01.334
I didn't make up the rules.

675
00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:04.463
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

676
00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:08.133
otherwise it's gonna have
to be all stick. Okay?

677
00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:10.343
You got three months.

678
00:57:10.427 --> 00:57:12.471
That's when the 'dozers get there.

679
00:57:12.846 --> 00:57:14.639
Well, we're wasting time.

680
00:57:15.849 --> 00:57:16.933
I like this guy.

681
00:57:17.017 --> 00:57:18.018
Guys, right now...

682
00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.741
Okay, let's run
through them again.

683
00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:23.023
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

684
00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:26.902
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan.

685
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:27.986
He's the clan leader.

686
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:29.988
But she's the spiritual leader.

687
00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:31.823
- Like a shaman.
- Got it.

688
00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:33.867
T'su'tey.

689
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.118
Tsu'tey.

690
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:36.203
Tsu'tey.

691
00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:37.954
He'll be the next clan leader.

692
00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:40.957
Neytiri.

693
00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:42.542
She'll be the next <i>Tsahik.</i>

694
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:43.710
They become a mated pair.

695
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.421
So who's this Eywa?

696
00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:47.756
"Who's Eywa?"

697
00:57:48.507 --> 00:57:49.674
Only their deity.

698
00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:53.553
Their goddess, made up of all
living things. Everything they know!

699
00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:55.806
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

700
00:57:55.889 --> 00:57:57.492
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

701
00:57:57.516 --> 00:57:59.059
Come on. That's not a...

702
00:57:59.684 --> 00:58:01.645
Knock it off.
It's like kindergarten around here.

703
00:58:03.897 --> 00:58:05.690
Neytiri was my best student.

704
00:58:06.775 --> 00:58:08.318
She and her sister, Sylwanin.

705
00:58:09.903 --> 00:58:12.405
Just amazing girls.

706
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:14.157
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

707
00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:16.034
She's dead.

708
00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:22.499
Let's go. Village life starts early.

709
00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:27.212
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

710
00:58:46.398 --> 00:58:47.691
Easy, boy.

711
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.943
Pale is female.

712
00:58:53.488 --> 00:58:55.907
Okay. Easy, girl.

713
00:59:24.811 --> 00:59:26.438
That is <i>shahaylu.</i>

714
00:59:27.522 --> 00:59:28.565
The bond.

715
00:59:30.442 --> 00:59:31.568
Feel her.

716
00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:36.406
Feel her heartbeat.

717
00:59:37.866 --> 00:59:38.867
Her breath.

718
00:59:42.037 --> 00:59:43.830
Feel her strong legs.

719
00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:47.834
You may tell her what to do.

720
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:49.794
Inside.

721
00:59:50.712 --> 00:59:53.882
For now, say where to go.

722
00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:57.886
Forward!

723
01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:16.905
You should go away.

724
01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:18.907
No, you'd miss me.

725
01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.701
I knew you could speak English.

726
01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.165
This alien will learn nothing...

727
01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.250
...A rock sees more...

728
01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.503
...look at him.

729
01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:41.846
Again.

730
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.724
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

731
01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.435
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

732
01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.270
There's an outer row of columns.

733
01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.189
- Huh.
- Real heavy duty.

734
01:00:51.272 --> 01:00:54.150
There's a secondary ring here,
and an inner ring.

735
01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:56.611
There's a core structure like a spiral.

736
01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.114
That's how they move up and down.

737
01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.783
We're gonna need accurate
scans on every column.

738
01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:03.159
Roger that.

739
01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.537
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

740
01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:09.165
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

741
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:14.879
So where are we going?

742
01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.215
Getting out of Dodge.

743
01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.510
I'm not about to let
Selfridge and Quaritch

744
01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:22.137
micro-manage this thing.

745
01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:26.016
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

746
01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.392
way up in the mountains.

747
01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.437
The Hallelujah Mountains?

748
01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.188
That's right.

749
01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.481
Are you serious?

750
01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:34.566
Yeah.

751
01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.693
Yes!

752
01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:41.406
The legendary floating
mountains of Pandora.

753
01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:42.741
Heard of them?

754
01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:57.297
We're getting close.

755
01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.799
Yeah, look at my instruments.

756
01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:03.178
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

757
01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:06.139
We're VFR from here on.

758
01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.390
What's VFR?

759
01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:09.976
Means you gotta see
where you're going.

760
01:02:10.643 --> 01:02:12.103
You can't see anything.

761
01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:14.564
Exactly.
Ain't that a bitch?

762
01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.710
Oh, my God.

763
01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:48.181
You should see your faces.

764
01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.502
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

765
01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:33.226
<i>So what does hold them up?</i>

766
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:34.686
<i>Grace explained it to me.</i>

767
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.647
<i>Some kind ofmaglev effect.</i>

768
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:41.568
<i>Because unobtanium is
a superconductor... or something.</i>

769
01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.174
Welcome to camp.

770
01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:12.682
So, this is my bunk.

771
01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:14.225
This stuff is nasty.

772
01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.395
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

773
01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:18.622
<i>Grace didn't miss a thing.</i>

774
01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:20.166
Trudy, you'll take the top one.

775
01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.775
<i>She knew
I was talking to the Colonel.</i>

776
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.529
<i>But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,</i>

777
01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:28.781
<i>so she's playing nice.</i>

778
01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.452
All right. Jake, hang a left.

779
01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.037
You'll be in the link at the end.

780
01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:41.002
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

781
01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.095
Holy shit!

782
01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:33.763
Do not look in her eye.

783
01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.225
Seyzey.

784
01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.607
<i>Ikran</i> is not horse.

785
01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.610
Once <i>shahaylu</i> is made...

786
01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:55.576
<i>...ikran</i> will fly with only
one hunter in the whole life.

787
01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:08.506
To become <i>taronyu,</i> hunter,

788
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:12.176
you must choose your own <i>ikran</i>
and he must choose you.

789
01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.764
- When?
- When you are ready.

790
01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:10.401
Okay. This is video log 12.

791
01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.196
Time's 2132.

792
01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:15.907
Do I have to do this now?

793
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.950
I... I really need to get some rack.

794
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.912
No, now. When it's fresh.

795
01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:25.416
Okay, location, shack,

796
01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.211
and the days are starting
to blur together.

797
01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:33.549
<i>The language is a pain, but,</i>

798
01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:35.802
<i>you know, I figure it's like
field-stripping a weapon.</i>

799
01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.303
<i>Just repetition, repetition.</i>

800
01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:38.971
<i>- Navi.
- "Nari."</i>

801
01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.057
<i>- Nari.</i>
<i>- "Narrri"!</i>

802
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:42.767
<i>Narrri!</i>

803
01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.645
<i>Txur ni'ul.</i> Stronger.

804
01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.527
<i>Neytiri calls me</i> skxawng.

805
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.945
<i>It means moron.</i>

806
01:07:56.114 --> 01:07:57.657
This is a very important part of it.

807
01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.051
<i>Norm's attitude has improved lately.</i>

808
01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.076
I see you. I see you.

809
01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.328
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

810
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.080
it's "I see into you. I See you."

811
01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:06.850
<i>It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a</i> skxawng, <i>too.</i>

812
01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:08.185
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."

813
01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:09.269
So you gotta get this, okay?

814
01:08:09.293 --> 01:08:11.504
I gotta run! Okay?

815
01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:12.588
Let's go.

816
01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:16.843
<i>My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day.</i>

817
01:08:18.803 --> 01:08:21.347
<i>I have to trust my body
to know what to do.</i>

818
01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.563
Yeah! Check it out!

819
01:08:29.355 --> 01:08:30.356
Oh, crap!

820
01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:39.866
<i>Every day, it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,</i>

821
01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:42.201
<i>the tiniest scents and sounds.</i>

822
01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:50.126
<i>She's always going on
about the flow of energy,</i>

823
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:52.461
<i>the spirits of animals.</i>

824
01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:55.923
<i>I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final.</i>

825
01:08:56.007 --> 01:08:57.133
<i>This isn't just about</i>

826
01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:59.719
eye-hand coordination
out there, you know.

827
01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:01.888
You need to listen to what she says.

828
01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:05.725
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

829
01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.060
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

830
01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.412
<i>With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.</i>

831
01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:29.081
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

832
01:09:58.819 --> 01:10:01.072
<i>I talked Mo'at
into letting Grace into the village.</i>

833
01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:02.490
Look how big you are.

834
01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:04.635
<i>It's the first time
since her school was closed down.</i>

835
01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:06.452
You are so pretty.

836
01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:36.941
Come on, Marine.

837
01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.052
<i>I'm trying to understand
this deep connection</i>

838
01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.887
<i>the people have to the forest.</i>

839
01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:10.891
<i>She talks about a network of energy</i>

840
01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.061
<i>that flows through all living things.</i>

841
01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:18.316
<i>She says all energy is only borrowed,</i>

842
01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:21.235
<i>and one day you have to give it back.</i>

843
01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:05.488
You were in 16 hours today.

844
01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:10.242
You're still losing weight.

845
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.624
No, you don't.

846
01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:19.168
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Come back here.

847
01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:23.005
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

848
01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:26.634
Today I made a kill.

849
01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.805
And we ate it. At least,
I know where that meal came from.

850
01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:35.059
Other body. You need to
take care of this body. Okay?

851
01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.685
- Get it? Let's eat it.
- Yeah, yeah.

852
01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.022
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

853
01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:41.273
Give it to me.

854
01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:43.901
- You look like crap.
- Thank you.

855
01:12:43.984 --> 01:12:45.653
You're burning way too hard.

856
01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:47.988
Get rid of this shit.

857
01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.116
And then you can lecture me.

858
01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.745
Now, I'm telling you, as your boss,

859
01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:58.749
and as someone who might even
consider being a friend someday

860
01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.710
To take some down time.

861
01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:03.629
Eat this, please.

862
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:08.175
Trust me, I... learned the hard way.

863
01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:25.526
What did happen at the school, Grace?

864
01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:38.122
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin,
stopped coming to school.

865
01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.333
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

866
01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:46.797
And one day, she and a couple of
other young hunters came running in

867
01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:48.299
all painted up.

868
01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:52.678
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

869
01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.309
I guess they thought
I could protect them.

870
01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:04.190
The troopers pursued them to the school.

871
01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.943
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

872
01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.695
Right in front of Neytiri.

873
01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.614
And then shot the others.

874
01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.993
I got most of the kids out.

875
01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:21.457
But they never came back.

876
01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:26.462
I'm sorry.

877
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:38.182
A scientist stays objective.

878
01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:42.144
We can't be ruled by emotion.

879
01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:46.482
But I put 10 years of my life
into that school.

880
01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:50.528
They called me <i>sa'nok.</i>

881
01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:53.822
Mother.

882
01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:54.907
Mother.

883
01:14:57.117 --> 01:15:01.413
That kind of pain
reaches back through the link.

884
01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:28.107
I see you...

885
01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:29.984
...Brother

886
01:15:30.067 --> 01:15:32.069
...and thank you.

887
01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.741
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

888
01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:40.536
Your body stays behind...

889
01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:43.497
...to become part of The People.

890
01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:48.294
A clean kill.

891
01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:52.923
You are ready.

892
01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:22.536
<i>Learning to ride an</i> ikran,
<i>we call them banshees,</i>

893
01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:24.621
<i>is the test every young hunter
has to pass.</i>

894
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.753
<i>But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are.</i>

895
01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.755
<i>Oo-rah.</i>

896
01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.537
Now what?

897
01:18:53.645 --> 01:18:55.230
Jakesully will go first.

898
01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:32.684
Now you choose your <i>ikran.</i>
This you must feel inside.

899
01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.771
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

900
01:19:36.396 --> 01:19:38.065
You will have one chance, Jake.

901
01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:40.817
How will I know if he chooses me?

902
01:19:41.568 --> 01:19:43.028
He will try to kill you.

903
01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:46.156
Outstanding.

904
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.551
Let's dance.

905
01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:55.809
That moron's going to die.

906
01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:21.501
Don't be afraid, warrior.

907
01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:22.878
Make the bond!

908
01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:27.507
No!

909
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:32.679
Jake!

910
01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:47.861
<i>Shahaylu,</i> Jake.

911
01:21:50.614 --> 01:21:51.865
<i>Shahaylu!</i>

912
01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:03.085
Stop!

913
01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:13.887
That's right.

914
01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.264
You're mine.

915
01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:32.781
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

916
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.910
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?

917
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.378
God damn!

918
01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:52.217
Oh, shit!

919
01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:03.353
Oh, shut up and fly straight!

920
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:16.366
That's it. Bank left!

921
01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:27.544
Level out! That's it.

922
01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.009
Whoo! Jakesully!

923
01:23:58.825 --> 01:23:59.826
Hey!

924
01:24:06.249 --> 01:24:07.459
Let's go!

925
01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:21.473
Yeah, baby, I got this!

926
01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:23.975
Oh, shit!

927
01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.316
<i>I may not be
much of a horse guy,</i>

928
01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:32.776
<i>but I was born to do this.</i>

929
01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:34.486
Yeah!

930
01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:39.032
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

931
01:24:39.115 --> 01:24:41.993
I turn. I feel the wind.
I turn very strong.

932
01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.079
Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

933
01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:48.018
<i>The Tree of Souls.</i>

934
01:25:51.354 --> 01:25:53.773
It's their most sacred place.

935
01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:57.402
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

936
01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:59.237
Yeah, that's what messes up
my instruments.

937
01:25:59.696 --> 01:26:04.409
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

938
01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:07.495
I would die to get samples.

939
01:26:08.204 --> 01:26:10.999
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

940
01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:12.459
You lucky swine.

941
01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:34.749
Hell, yeah!

942
01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:36.543
Hell, yeah!

943
01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:53.017
<i>I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.</i>

944
01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:57.439
<i>Only problem is,
you're not the only one.</i>

945
01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:02.277
Dive!

946
01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:26.468
Go, go!

947
01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:35.977
Follow me!

948
01:29:22.398 --> 01:29:24.484
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

949
01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.153
It is <i>Toruk.</i>

950
01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:28.988
Last Shadow.

951
01:29:30.657 --> 01:29:33.785
Yeah, right.
It's the last one you ever see.

952
01:29:38.414 --> 01:29:41.709
My grandfather's grandfather
was <i>Toruk Macto.</i>

953
01:29:42.836 --> 01:29:44.629
Rider of Last Shadow.

954
01:29:46.005 --> 01:29:47.215
He rode this?

955
01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:50.426
<i>Toruk</i> chose him.

956
01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:54.931
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

957
01:29:55.014 --> 01:29:56.933
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

958
01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:59.602
<i>Toruk Macto</i> was mighty.

959
01:30:01.437 --> 01:30:04.232
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

960
01:30:05.275 --> 01:30:07.610
All Na'vi people know the story.

961
01:30:14.325 --> 01:30:16.035
<i>Everything is backwards now.</i>

962
01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:21.207
<i>Like out there is the true world
and in here is the dream.</i>

963
01:30:42.228 --> 01:30:44.564
<i>It's hard to believe
it's only been three months.</i>

964
01:30:48.067 --> 01:30:49.903
I can barely remember my old life.

965
01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:55.909
I don't know who I am anymore.

966
01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:16.721
Haven't gotten lost
in the woods, have you?

967
01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:23.061
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

968
01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:27.857
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

969
01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.404
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

970
01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:34.572
No, I can do this.

971
01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:37.075
You already have.

972
01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:40.203
You give me good, usable intel.

973
01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:42.330
Oh, this Tree of Souls place.

974
01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:44.749
Yeah, I got them
by the balls with that

975
01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:48.169
when this turns into a shit fight,
which it will. Yeah.

976
01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:51.130
Now it's time to come in.

977
01:31:52.548 --> 01:31:53.841
By the way...

978
01:31:54.968 --> 01:31:56.886
...you gonna get your legs back.

979
01:31:57.804 --> 01:32:00.014
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.

980
01:32:00.098 --> 01:32:01.432
It's a done deal.

981
01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.267
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

982
01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.269
I'm a man of my word.

983
01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.149
I gotta finish this.

984
01:32:12.735 --> 01:32:13.861
There's one more thing.

985
01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:17.448
Ceremony. It's...

986
01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:19.867
It's the final stage of becoming a man.

987
01:32:22.537 --> 01:32:24.080
If I do it, I'm one of them.

988
01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:27.375
And they'll trust me.

989
01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:34.007
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

990
01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.398
Well, then, you'd better
get it done, Corporal.

991
01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:11.836
<i>The Na'vi say that
every person is born twice.</i>

992
01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.132
<i>The second time</i>

993
01:33:16.215 --> 01:33:19.761
<i>is when you earn your place
among The People forever.</i>

994
01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:29.437
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

995
01:33:30.688 --> 01:33:33.858
You are part of The People.

996
01:34:20.238 --> 01:34:21.697
Come.

997
01:34:21.781 --> 01:34:23.658
Come.

998
01:34:39.882 --> 01:34:42.593
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

999
01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.097
And sometimes answered.

1000
01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:56.649
We call these trees <i>Utraya Mokri.</i>

1001
01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:59.402
The Tree of Voices.

1002
01:35:01.445 --> 01:35:03.531
The voices of our ancestors.

1003
01:35:18.588 --> 01:35:19.881
I can hear them.

1004
01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:26.220
They live, Jake...

1005
01:35:28.764 --> 01:35:30.183
within Eywa.

1006
01:35:34.353 --> 01:35:36.230
You are Omaticaya now.

1007
01:35:36.939 --> 01:35:40.067
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

1008
01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.742
And you may choose a woman.

1009
01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:51.871
We have many fine women.

1010
01:35:53.122 --> 01:35:55.124
Ninat is the best singer.

1011
01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.837
But I don't want Ninat.

1012
01:36:04.217 --> 01:36:06.177
Beyral is a good hunter.

1013
01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:09.889
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

1014
01:36:11.974 --> 01:36:13.684
I've already chosen.

1015
01:36:17.063 --> 01:36:19.690
But this woman must also choose me.

1016
01:36:23.694 --> 01:36:25.196
She already has.

1017
01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:21.544
I am with you now, Jake.

1018
01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:25.089
<i>We are mated for life.</i>

1019
01:37:31.345 --> 01:37:33.139
<i>What the hell
are you doing, Jake?</i>

1020
01:38:03.836 --> 01:38:04.837
<i>Ma</i> Jake!

1021
01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.339
Don't forget
your phase integration.

1022
01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:07.816
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

1023
01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.051
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

1024
01:38:18.184 --> 01:38:20.061
Jake! Jake.

1025
01:38:20.936 --> 01:38:22.980
Wake up! Jake, please!

1026
01:38:23.773 --> 01:38:25.649
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

1027
01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:28.694
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

1028
01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:34.033
Jake!

1029
01:38:43.042 --> 01:38:44.043
Okay.

1030
01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:57.056
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

1031
01:38:57.139 --> 01:38:59.392
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

1032
01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:01.685
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

1033
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:06.774
Jake!

1034
01:39:13.739 --> 01:39:16.200
Jake! Wake up!

1035
01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:18.327
Jake! Wake up!

1036
01:39:22.164 --> 01:39:23.624
Hey!

1037
01:39:24.208 --> 01:39:26.627
Stop! Stop!

1038
01:39:26.919 --> 01:39:29.130
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

1039
01:39:33.717 --> 01:39:34.718
Hey, boss.

1040
01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:36.720
Hey!

1041
01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:40.391
- What?
- I got a native

1042
01:39:40.474 --> 01:39:43.436
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

1043
01:39:43.519 --> 01:39:45.938
Well, keep going. He'll move.

1044
01:39:46.689 --> 01:39:48.649
These people have to learn
that we don't stop.

1045
01:39:48.732 --> 01:39:49.900
Come on, go, go, go.

1046
01:39:51.068 --> 01:39:52.153
Hey!

1047
01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:54.530
Stop! Hey!

1048
01:39:54.613 --> 01:39:56.574
Go! Go!

1049
01:39:57.908 --> 01:39:59.368
There, see? He moved.

1050
01:40:11.714 --> 01:40:13.591
Dude, dude. Dude!
Dude, no!

1051
01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:15.092
Oh! I'm blind.

1052
01:40:27.605 --> 01:40:29.648
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

1053
01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:32.568
Here, come on!

1054
01:40:57.968 --> 01:41:00.304
Freeze it right there.

1055
01:41:02.097 --> 01:41:04.600
Scale up. Enhance.

1056
01:41:06.227 --> 01:41:07.561
Son of a bitch.

1057
01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:10.731
Unbelievable.

1058
01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:13.817
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

1059
01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:22.868
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

1060
01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.751
Stop, please!

1061
01:41:32.253 --> 01:41:34.338
This will only make it worse.

1062
01:41:34.463 --> 01:41:36.215
You do not speak here!

1063
01:41:37.383 --> 01:41:39.093
We will strike them in the heart.

1064
01:41:47.101 --> 01:41:48.894
Tsu'tey!
Don't do this.

1065
01:41:52.273 --> 01:41:53.649
- You!
- Listen. Brother...

1066
01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:00.990
You mated with this woman?

1067
01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:02.157
Oh, shit.

1068
01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:05.703
Is this true?

1069
01:42:07.204 --> 01:42:10.416
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

1070
01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:12.960
Brother, please.

1071
01:42:13.043 --> 01:42:15.170
Do not attack the Sky People.

1072
01:42:15.254 --> 01:42:16.797
Many Omaticaya will die
if you do.

1073
01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.757
You are not my brother!

1074
01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:24.179
And I am not your enemy!

1075
01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:28.684
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

1076
01:42:31.103 --> 01:42:32.688
Go! Go! Go!

1077
01:42:35.899 --> 01:42:38.360
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

1078
01:42:38.444 --> 01:42:39.737
Tsu'tey!

1079
01:42:46.076 --> 01:42:48.746
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

1080
01:42:49.788 --> 01:42:52.041
And I have the right to speak.

1081
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:58.464
I have something to say...

1082
01:43:00.799 --> 01:43:02.301
...to all of you.

1083
01:43:06.388 --> 01:43:08.474
The words
are like stones in my heart.

1084
01:43:12.811 --> 01:43:14.730
Sir, I'm sorry.
No, no, no! Hold on!

1085
01:43:14.813 --> 01:43:17.107
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

1086
01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:19.610
It's very dangerous!

1087
01:43:22.237 --> 01:43:23.405
Grace!

1088
01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:25.908
Oh, no.

1089
01:43:25.991 --> 01:43:27.534
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

1090
01:43:29.495 --> 01:43:31.789
Okay. Look...

1091
01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:34.208
I was sent here to...

1092
01:43:37.795 --> 01:43:39.171
You see?

1093
01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:41.840
It is a demon in a false body.

1094
01:44:01.777 --> 01:44:03.112
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

1095
01:44:03.195 --> 01:44:04.738
You crossed the line.

1096
01:44:08.617 --> 01:44:10.285
Wheel this meat out of here.

1097
01:44:12.496 --> 01:44:14.832
Jake!
What the hell is going on here?

1098
01:44:18.293 --> 01:44:20.087
You let me down, son.

1099
01:44:22.297 --> 01:44:23.340
So, what,

1100
01:44:24.842 --> 01:44:26.802
you find yourself some local tail

1101
01:44:26.885 --> 01:44:29.805
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

1102
01:44:29.888 --> 01:44:32.683
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

1103
01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:34.768
- Parker...
- Shut your pie hole!

1104
01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:39.565
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

1105
01:44:39.648 --> 01:44:40.858
I could do that.

1106
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:42.401
You need to muzzle your dog.

1107
01:44:42.484 --> 01:44:45.070
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

1108
01:44:45.154 --> 01:44:47.239
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

1109
01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.283
You start by listening to her.

1110
01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:52.286
Those trees were sacred
to the Omaticaya

1111
01:44:52.369 --> 01:44:54.169
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

1112
01:44:54.204 --> 01:44:59.585
You throw a stick in the air around here,
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

1113
01:44:59.668 --> 01:45:00.753
for Christ's sake!

1114
01:45:00.836 --> 01:45:04.006
I'm not talking about some
kind of pagan voodoo here.

1115
01:45:04.089 --> 01:45:05.507
I'm talking about something real,

1116
01:45:05.591 --> 01:45:08.343
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

1117
01:45:08.427 --> 01:45:09.845
Which is what, exactly?

1118
01:45:10.888 --> 01:45:12.181
What we think we know

1119
01:45:12.264 --> 01:45:15.642
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

1120
01:45:15.726 --> 01:45:19.813
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

1121
01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:23.650
And each tree has
ten-to-the-fourth connections

1122
01:45:23.734 --> 01:45:27.780
to the trees around it. And there are
ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

1123
01:45:28.947 --> 01:45:30.574
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

1124
01:45:31.283 --> 01:45:33.702
It's more connections
than the human brain.

1125
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:37.372
Get it? It's a network.

1126
01:45:37.456 --> 01:45:40.501
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

1127
01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:44.046
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

1128
01:45:44.129 --> 01:45:46.799
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

1129
01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:48.550
Yes!

1130
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.637
What the hell
have you people

1131
01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.180
been smoking out there?

1132
01:45:54.473 --> 01:45:56.725
They're just goddamn trees!

1133
01:45:58.352 --> 01:45:59.686
You need to wake up, Parker.

1134
01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:01.104
No. You need to wake up.

1135
01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:03.941
The wealth of this world
isn't in the ground.

1136
01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.651
It's all around us.

1137
01:46:05.734 --> 01:46:09.446
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

1138
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:13.283
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

1139
01:46:13.909 --> 01:46:18.580
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

1140
01:46:20.332 --> 01:46:22.793
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

1141
01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.753
<i>They're not gonna give up their home.</i>

1142
01:46:26.922 --> 01:46:28.590
<i>They're not gonna make a deal.</i>

1143
01:46:29.633 --> 01:46:31.426
<i>For what? Lite beer?</i>

1144
01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:34.054
<i>And bluejeans?</i>

1145
01:46:37.307 --> 01:46:39.560
<i>There's nothing that we have
that they want.</i>

1146
01:46:42.104 --> 01:46:45.148
<i>Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time.</i>

1147
01:46:49.945 --> 01:46:51.488
<i>They're never gonna leave Hometree.</i>

1148
01:46:54.199 --> 01:46:55.492
So,

1149
01:46:56.118 --> 01:47:00.247
since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

1150
01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:03.083
Jake, thanks.

1151
01:47:03.166 --> 01:47:07.296
I'm getting all emotional.
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

1152
01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:35.198
Talk to me, Lyle.

1153
01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:37.951
<i>It looks like they hit it
with banshees first.</i>

1154
01:47:38.035 --> 01:47:39.620
<i>See the angle's steep?</i>

1155
01:47:44.082 --> 01:47:46.168
<i>They set the ampsuit on fire.</i>

1156
01:47:46.251 --> 01:47:47.669
<i>Driver's toast.</i>

1157
01:47:49.212 --> 01:47:51.006
The rest of the squad?

1158
01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:55.010
<i>Six bodies. That's all of them.</i>

1159
01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:57.596
<i>The equipment's totaled.</i>

1160
01:48:00.349 --> 01:48:01.975
Jesus Christ.

1161
01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:09.358
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

1162
01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:12.402
I'll drive them out with gas first.

1163
01:48:14.279 --> 01:48:15.489
It'll be humane.

1164
01:48:17.074 --> 01:48:18.075
More or less.

1165
01:48:20.369 --> 01:48:21.787
All right, let's pull the trigger.

1166
01:48:25.749 --> 01:48:28.293
Come on, people.
Let's get it packed, let's go.

1167
01:48:28.377 --> 01:48:31.838
You know,
they never even wanted us to succeed.

1168
01:48:32.422 --> 01:48:37.219
They bulldozed a sacred site
on purpose to trigger a response.

1169
01:48:38.178 --> 01:48:40.973
Just fabricating this war
to get what they want.

1170
01:48:41.056 --> 01:48:42.641
This is how it's done.

1171
01:48:46.144 --> 01:48:49.231
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

1172
01:48:49.314 --> 01:48:51.233
you make them your enemy.

1173
01:48:51.316 --> 01:48:53.443
Then you're justified in taking it.

1174
01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:56.947
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

1175
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:58.031
My God.

1176
01:49:04.413 --> 01:49:07.541
Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!

1177
01:49:07.624 --> 01:49:08.667
Back off!

1178
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:10.919
Parker. Wait. Stop.

1179
01:49:11.002 --> 01:49:12.402
These are people you're about to...

1180
01:49:12.462 --> 01:49:13.690
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

1181
01:49:13.714 --> 01:49:17.050
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

1182
01:49:17.134 --> 01:49:18.385
All right? Look around!

1183
01:49:18.927 --> 01:49:21.012
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees!

1184
01:49:21.096 --> 01:49:22.097
They can move!

1185
01:49:22.597 --> 01:49:24.117
- Can you guys just please...
- Yes, sir.

1186
01:49:24.141 --> 01:49:26.768
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

1187
01:49:26.852 --> 01:49:28.145
Are you gonna kill children?

1188
01:49:28.228 --> 01:49:30.108
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands.

1189
01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:32.065
Believe me.

1190
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:34.443
Just let me try to talk them out.

1191
01:49:35.444 --> 01:49:36.611
They trust me.

1192
01:49:40.198 --> 01:49:42.617
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

1193
01:49:42.701 --> 01:49:44.786
Calibrating three and four.

1194
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:45.871
Run sequence.

1195
01:49:45.954 --> 01:49:47.664
Initiating. Thirty seconds.

1196
01:49:52.043 --> 01:49:53.803
Listen to me.
You've got one hour.

1197
01:49:53.879 --> 01:49:56.399
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

1198
01:49:56.465 --> 01:49:58.049
you get them to evacuate.

1199
01:49:58.133 --> 01:49:59.176
One hour.

1200
01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:06.266
Father!

1201
01:50:06.558 --> 01:50:07.559
Mother!

1202
01:50:07.642 --> 01:50:10.854
Eytukan, I have something to say.

1203
01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:12.272
Listen!

1204
01:50:13.398 --> 01:50:14.858
Speak, Jakesully.

1205
01:50:16.234 --> 01:50:19.112
A great evil is upon us...

1206
01:50:19.529 --> 01:50:21.406
The Sky People are coming...

1207
01:50:21.656 --> 01:50:24.159
...to destroy Hometree.

1208
01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:28.181
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

1209
01:50:30.624 --> 01:50:33.251
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

1210
01:50:33.335 --> 01:50:35.086
Are you certain of this?

1211
01:50:39.216 --> 01:50:42.928
Look, they sent me here
to learn your ways

1212
01:50:43.887 --> 01:50:47.516
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

1213
01:50:49.935 --> 01:50:51.311
What are you saying, Jake?

1214
01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.396
You knew this would happen?

1215
01:50:56.775 --> 01:50:57.859
Yes.

1216
01:50:58.318 --> 01:51:00.612
Look, at first it was just orders,

1217
01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:04.491
and then everything changed.

1218
01:51:04.574 --> 01:51:05.909
Okay? I fell in love.

1219
01:51:07.118 --> 01:51:10.080
I fell in love with the...
with the forest

1220
01:51:10.163 --> 01:51:12.415
and with the Omaticaya people.

1221
01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.626
And with you.

1222
01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:17.838
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

1223
01:51:17.921 --> 01:51:19.339
I trusted you!

1224
01:51:19.422 --> 01:51:20.757
Trust me now, please.

1225
01:51:28.139 --> 01:51:30.559
You will never be one of The People!

1226
01:51:30.642 --> 01:51:32.411
- I shouldn't have...
- We tried to stop them!

1227
01:51:32.435 --> 01:51:34.479
Neytiri, please! Please.

1228
01:51:39.484 --> 01:51:40.569
Bind them.

1229
01:51:42.279 --> 01:51:43.363
Leave now!

1230
01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:46.408
You have to go.
They're coming!

1231
01:52:00.755 --> 01:52:02.924
<i>Time on target, one mike.</i>

1232
01:52:03.008 --> 01:52:04.968
<i>Copy. We have a visual.</i>

1233
01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:08.013
<i>Roger that. Stay on heading 030.</i>

1234
01:52:08.096 --> 01:52:09.514
<i>Roger, 030.</i>

1235
01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:25.363
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

1236
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:28.634
They will destroy this place.

1237
01:52:28.658 --> 01:52:30.452
Neytiri, you must go now!

1238
01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:36.875
Run to the forest! Run!

1239
01:52:39.252 --> 01:52:40.563
Run! Run!

1240
01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:44.257
Have no fear.

1241
01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:03.902
No! God damn it, run!

1242
01:53:05.070 --> 01:53:06.529
Take the ikran...

1243
01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:08.156
...attack from above.

1244
01:53:12.452 --> 01:53:14.579
That is one big damn tree.

1245
01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:26.174
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1246
01:53:28.343 --> 01:53:30.428
All right, people, let's get this done!

1247
01:53:30.512 --> 01:53:33.348
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

1248
01:53:33.431 --> 01:53:35.308
Roger. CS-40s, going hot.

1249
01:53:35.934 --> 01:53:36.977
- Fire.
- Firing.

1250
01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.532
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

1251
01:53:58.415 --> 01:54:00.083
Sir, they've opened fire.

1252
01:54:02.002 --> 01:54:03.753
You've got to be kidding me!

1253
01:54:16.307 --> 01:54:18.560
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

1254
01:54:18.893 --> 01:54:20.562
All right, let's turn up the heat.

1255
01:54:20.645 --> 01:54:21.896
Switch incendiaries!

1256
01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:23.481
Switching incendiaries.

1257
01:54:23.565 --> 01:54:24.774
<i>Fire.</i>

1258
01:54:28.153 --> 01:54:29.237
No!

1259
01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:44.044
Get everyone to the forest.

1260
01:54:47.505 --> 01:54:49.591
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

1261
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:54.679
Neytiri!

1262
01:55:03.354 --> 01:55:05.690
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

1263
01:55:06.483 --> 01:55:07.692
My God!

1264
01:55:26.336 --> 01:55:27.879
Mo'at! No!

1265
01:55:27.962 --> 01:55:29.714
If you are one of us,

1266
01:55:31.216 --> 01:55:32.383
help us.

1267
01:55:40.308 --> 01:55:42.143
All call signs, switch missiles.

1268
01:55:42.477 --> 01:55:44.896
<i>Give me HEs at the base
of the west columns.</i>

1269
01:55:46.689 --> 01:55:48.108
This way!

1270
01:55:49.317 --> 01:55:51.170
<i>Rider section,
switch missiles.</i>

1271
01:55:51.194 --> 01:55:53.071
<i>- One's good.</i>
<i>- Two's rocks up.</i>

1272
01:55:53.154 --> 01:55:55.740
<i>- Three's up.</i>
- Yeah, baby, get some!

1273
01:55:56.324 --> 01:55:58.576
<i>Charlie Oscar,
Gunrunner standing by.</i>

1274
01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:00.078
- Bring it down.
<i>- Cleared hot.</i>

1275
01:56:07.127 --> 01:56:08.586
Come on, Grace, move!

1276
01:56:11.256 --> 01:56:12.382
Down! Head down!

1277
01:56:15.593 --> 01:56:17.762
Come on, come on! Down!

1278
01:56:22.308 --> 01:56:23.309
<i>Solid hits.</i>

1279
01:56:23.393 --> 01:56:24.453
<i>Solid rocks on target.</i>

1280
01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:25.478
Screw this.

1281
01:56:27.021 --> 01:56:28.857
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1282
01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:30.900
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1283
01:56:40.577 --> 01:56:42.203
<i>Repeat. Ripple fire.</i>

1284
01:57:25.997 --> 01:57:27.624
Go! Go! Go!

1285
01:58:00.657 --> 01:58:03.034
No, no, get back! Back!

1286
01:58:22.845 --> 01:58:24.514
Come on, move! Move!

1287
01:59:09.726 --> 01:59:13.354
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1288
01:59:14.022 --> 01:59:15.023
Let's boogie.

1289
01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:18.276
<i>Dragon coming left,
heading home.</i>

1290
01:59:18.568 --> 01:59:19.861
<i>Gunrunner coming left.</i>

1291
01:59:20.486 --> 01:59:21.526
<i>Thunder copies.</i>

1292
01:59:21.571 --> 01:59:22.851
<i>Rider section copies.</i>

1293
01:59:30.747 --> 01:59:31.748
Father!

1294
01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:48.890
Daughter...

1295
01:59:50.183 --> 01:59:53.227
take... my... bow.

1296
01:59:57.398 --> 02:00:01.819
Protect The People.

1297
02:00:10.244 --> 02:00:11.496
Neytiri!

1298
02:00:21.506 --> 02:00:23.299
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1299
02:00:23.383 --> 02:00:25.259
Get away.

1300
02:00:25.927 --> 02:00:27.220
Get away!

1301
02:00:28.388 --> 02:00:30.056
Get away from here!

1302
02:00:31.516 --> 02:00:33.101
Never come back!

1303
02:00:50.785 --> 02:00:51.911
Pull the plug.

1304
02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:55.498
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

1305
02:00:55.581 --> 02:00:57.583
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

1306
02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:16.018
<i>I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace.</i>

1307
02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:21.649
<i>Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.</i>

1308
02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:25.570
Let's go!

1309
02:01:33.744 --> 02:01:35.496
Put him down!

1310
02:01:38.708 --> 02:01:41.461
You murderer!

1311
02:02:28.090 --> 02:02:30.176
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1312
02:02:30.259 --> 02:02:31.344
Hey.

1313
02:02:32.678 --> 02:02:33.679
Personally, I don't feel

1314
02:02:33.763 --> 02:02:35.431
these tree-hugging traitors
deserve steak.

1315
02:02:35.515 --> 02:02:37.433
They get steak? That's bullshit.

1316
02:02:37.517 --> 02:02:39.018
Let me see that.

1317
02:02:39.852 --> 02:02:41.938
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1318
02:02:42.313 --> 02:02:43.314
Trudy!

1319
02:02:43.606 --> 02:02:44.815
All the way down.

1320
02:02:48.402 --> 02:02:49.403
Max!

1321
02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:01.958
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1322
02:03:02.792 --> 02:03:03.876
Here.

1323
02:03:15.972 --> 02:03:17.306
Clear. Come on.

1324
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:18.391
Here you go.

1325
02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:35.157
Max, stay here.

1326
02:03:35.783 --> 02:03:37.535
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1327
02:03:37.952 --> 02:03:39.120
Okay. Go.

1328
02:03:53.259 --> 02:03:54.468
Clear.

1329
02:03:56.178 --> 02:03:57.263
Come on, baby.

1330
02:03:57.346 --> 02:04:00.266
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1331
02:04:03.894 --> 02:04:06.647
It's Samson 1 -6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1332
02:04:09.984 --> 02:04:11.277
Three!

1333
02:04:14.071 --> 02:04:15.197
Come on!

1334
02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:18.367
Mask on!

1335
02:04:21.203 --> 02:04:22.663
Gas, gas, gas!

1336
02:04:24.665 --> 02:04:26.709
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1337
02:04:29.086 --> 02:04:30.087
Grab my hand!

1338
02:04:30.755 --> 02:04:32.048
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1339
02:04:33.382 --> 02:04:34.925
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1340
02:04:47.772 --> 02:04:48.898
Colonel!

1341
02:04:55.863 --> 02:04:58.658
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

1342
02:05:02.578 --> 02:05:03.579
Crap.

1343
02:05:03.663 --> 02:05:05.247
Everybody
all right back there?

1344
02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:06.832
Oh, yeah, baby!

1345
02:05:06.916 --> 02:05:09.043
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

1346
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:11.295
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1347
02:05:12.254 --> 02:05:13.923
- Grace is hit!
- What?

1348
02:05:15.174 --> 02:05:16.759
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

1349
02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:18.010
Keep the pressure on, Grace.

1350
02:05:18.094 --> 02:05:20.346
Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1351
02:05:20.429 --> 02:05:21.597
Hang on, Grace.

1352
02:05:21.681 --> 02:05:24.725
Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1353
02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:29.539
<i>You're good to go.</i>

1354
02:05:29.563 --> 02:05:30.690
Take it up!

1355
02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:33.784
<i>Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.</i>

1356
02:05:38.072 --> 02:05:39.198
You're clear!

1357
02:05:47.498 --> 02:05:49.667
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1358
02:05:50.251 --> 02:05:51.502
<i>Copy that.</i>

1359
02:05:58.718 --> 02:06:00.219
Norm, you all good up there?

1360
02:06:00.302 --> 02:06:01.762
<i>Yep! Still here.</i>

1361
02:06:03.889 --> 02:06:06.434
Well, at least
they can't track us up here.

1362
02:06:06.517 --> 02:06:08.310
Not this far into the Vortex.

1363
02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:10.938
It's strongest
at the Tree of Souls, right?

1364
02:06:11.021 --> 02:06:12.273
<i>Yeah.</i>

1365
02:06:12.356 --> 02:06:14.108
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1366
02:06:23.159 --> 02:06:24.326
Ouch.

1367
02:06:27.621 --> 02:06:28.622
You big baby.

1368
02:06:30.499 --> 02:06:31.709
We're moving.

1369
02:06:32.501 --> 02:06:34.044
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1370
02:06:35.504 --> 02:06:37.256
I'm a scientist, remember?

1371
02:06:38.591 --> 02:06:40.718
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1372
02:06:41.886 --> 02:06:43.471
The People can help you.

1373
02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:45.473
I know it.

1374
02:06:47.558 --> 02:06:49.143
Why would they help us?

1375
02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:08.579
<i>The People say Eywa will provide.</i>

1376
02:07:10.498 --> 02:07:13.209
<i>With no home, no hope,</i>

1377
02:07:14.251 --> 02:07:16.420
<i>there was only one place they could go.</i>

1378
02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:32.061
Link's running.

1379
02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:34.355
What's the plan here, Jake?

1380
02:07:34.438 --> 02:07:35.856
There's no plan.

1381
02:07:36.816 --> 02:07:39.151
Tsu'tey is <i>Olo'eyktan</i> now.

1382
02:07:39.235 --> 02:07:41.487
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1383
02:07:42.446 --> 02:07:43.572
I gotta try.

1384
02:07:46.617 --> 02:07:47.827
Launching.

1385
02:08:09.431 --> 02:08:10.641
<i>Outcast.</i>

1386
02:08:11.433 --> 02:08:12.685
<i>Betrayer.</i>

1387
02:08:13.769 --> 02:08:14.937
<i>Alien.</i>

1388
02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:18.816
<i>I was in the place
the eye does not see.</i>

1389
02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:34.248
<i>I needed their help,
and they needed mine.</i>

1390
02:08:35.165 --> 02:08:37.126
<i>But to ever face them again,</i>

1391
02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:39.503
<i>I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.</i>

1392
02:08:48.262 --> 02:08:51.599
<i>Sometimes your whole life
boils down to one insane move.</i>

1393
02:08:54.351 --> 02:08:55.686
There's something we gotta do.

1394
02:08:56.812 --> 02:08:58.022
You're not gonna like it.

1395
02:09:01.358 --> 02:09:02.443
Yah!

1396
02:09:08.574 --> 02:09:12.369
<i>The way I had it figured,</i>
Toruk <i>is the baddest cat in the sky.</i>

1397
02:09:12.453 --> 02:09:13.787
<i>Nothing attacks him.</i>

1398
02:09:14.622 --> 02:09:15.956
Easy, boy.

1399
02:09:16.373 --> 02:09:18.208
<i>So why would he ever look up?</i>

1400
02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.878
<i>But that was just a theory.</i>

1401
02:10:31.699 --> 02:10:33.283
<i>Toruk Macto?</i>

1402
02:11:11.822 --> 02:11:14.199
I See you.

1403
02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:18.787
I See you.

1404
02:11:27.337 --> 02:11:29.048
I was afraid, Jake.

1405
02:11:30.466 --> 02:11:31.967
For my people.

1406
02:11:35.012 --> 02:11:36.430
I'm not anymore.

1407
02:11:46.065 --> 02:11:48.317
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1408
02:11:48.984 --> 02:11:51.028
...I stand before you...

1409
02:11:52.029 --> 02:11:55.157
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1410
02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:01.955
You are <i>Olo'eyktan,</i>
and you are a great warrior.

1411
02:12:03.248 --> 02:12:04.368
I can't do this without you.

1412
02:12:12.466 --> 02:12:13.884
<i>Toruk Macto...</i>

1413
02:12:21.725 --> 02:12:23.477
I will fly with you.

1414
02:12:26.730 --> 02:12:28.482
My friend is dying.

1415
02:12:30.692 --> 02:12:32.236
Grace is dying.

1416
02:12:34.321 --> 02:12:36.240
I beg the help of Eywa.

1417
02:12:48.085 --> 02:12:49.294
Look where we are, Grace.

1418
02:12:56.885 --> 02:12:59.263
I need to take some samples.

1419
02:13:22.703 --> 02:13:26.790
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1420
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.459
in this body.

1421
02:13:31.837 --> 02:13:33.422
Is that possible?

1422
02:13:33.505 --> 02:13:38.427
She must pass through
the eye of Eywa and return.

1423
02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:40.554
But, Jakesully,

1424
02:13:42.055 --> 02:13:43.223
she is very weak.

1425
02:13:45.142 --> 02:13:48.103
Hang on, Grace.
They're gonna fix you up.

1426
02:13:51.190 --> 02:13:53.775
Hear us please, All Mother.

1427
02:13:55.110 --> 02:13:56.653
Eywa, help her.

1428
02:13:57.362 --> 02:13:59.531
Take this spirit into you...

1429
02:14:03.118 --> 02:14:05.704
...and breathe her back to us.

1430
02:14:09.124 --> 02:14:10.792
Let her walk among us...

1431
02:14:13.295 --> 02:14:15.255
...as one of The People.

1432
02:14:44.326 --> 02:14:45.410
Jake.

1433
02:14:47.704 --> 02:14:48.872
Grace.

1434
02:14:50.999 --> 02:14:52.709
I'm with her, Jake.

1435
02:14:54.711 --> 02:14:56.088
She's real!

1436
02:14:59.216 --> 02:15:02.302
Grace?
Grace, please. Grace!

1437
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:05.097
What's happening?

1438
02:15:06.056 --> 02:15:07.474
What's happening?

1439
02:15:12.062 --> 02:15:13.230
Grace!

1440
02:15:13.939 --> 02:15:15.107
Grace!

1441
02:15:17.192 --> 02:15:18.402
What's happening?

1442
02:15:25.075 --> 02:15:26.410
Did it work?

1443
02:15:32.165 --> 02:15:34.084
Her wounds were too great.

1444
02:15:34.918 --> 02:15:36.545
It was not enough time.

1445
02:15:37.921 --> 02:15:39.172
She is with Eywa now.

1446
02:16:13.457 --> 02:16:16.126
With your permission, I will speak now.

1447
02:16:18.503 --> 02:16:20.505
You would honor me by translating.

1448
02:16:28.055 --> 02:16:30.349
The Sky People
have sent us a message...

1449
02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:36.063
...that they can take whatever they want

1450
02:16:37.856 --> 02:16:39.649
and no one can stop them.

1451
02:16:43.236 --> 02:16:45.030
Well, we will send them a message.

1452
02:16:47.657 --> 02:16:49.993
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

1453
02:16:53.288 --> 02:16:55.248
You tell the other clans to come.

1454
02:16:59.002 --> 02:17:01.296
You tell them <i>Toruk Macto</i> calls to them.

1455
02:17:03.673 --> 02:17:06.301
And you fly now with me!

1456
02:17:07.344 --> 02:17:09.596
My brothers! Sisters!

1457
02:17:11.139 --> 02:17:12.974
And we will show the Sky People

1458
02:17:14.059 --> 02:17:15.894
that they cannot take
whatever they want,

1459
02:17:17.396 --> 02:17:18.855
and that this,

1460
02:17:19.564 --> 02:17:20.816
this is our land!

1461
02:17:27.697 --> 02:17:29.032
Yah!

1462
02:17:44.256 --> 02:17:45.674
Yah!

1463
02:18:15.078 --> 02:18:16.204
Yah!

1464
02:18:33.763 --> 02:18:35.474
<i>We rode out to the four winds.</i>

1465
02:18:38.226 --> 02:18:40.226
<i>To the horse clans of the plain.</i>

1466
02:18:43.607 --> 02:18:44.649
Back to the stars!

1467
02:18:44.733 --> 02:18:46.902
<i>To the</i> ikran <i>people of the Eastern Sea.</i>

1468
02:18:46.985 --> 02:18:48.278
For our children's children!

1469
02:18:48.361 --> 02:18:50.947
<i>When</i> Toruk Macto <i>called them, they came.</i>

1470
02:18:54.576 --> 02:18:56.161
Yah!

1471
02:19:32.322 --> 02:19:34.741
Everyone on this base,
every one of you,

1472
02:19:34.824 --> 02:19:36.952
is fighting for survival.

1473
02:19:37.035 --> 02:19:38.328
That's a fact!

1474
02:19:39.162 --> 02:19:42.207
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

1475
02:19:44.084 --> 02:19:48.255
Now, these orbital images tell me

1476
02:19:48.338 --> 02:19:51.466
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1477
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:54.135
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1478
02:19:54.678 --> 02:19:56.680
And more are pouring in.

1479
02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:01.643
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1480
02:20:02.644 --> 02:20:04.938
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

1481
02:20:05.021 --> 02:20:07.274
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1482
02:20:08.858 --> 02:20:12.445
Our only security
lies in pre-emptive attack.

1483
02:20:12.529 --> 02:20:14.948
We will fight terror with terror.

1484
02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:23.415
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1485
02:20:23.498 --> 02:20:25.834
is protected by their...

1486
02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:27.294
their deity.

1487
02:20:28.628 --> 02:20:30.547
And when we destroy it,

1488
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:33.133
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1489
02:20:33.216 --> 02:20:36.720
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks
of this place ever again.

1490
02:20:36.803 --> 02:20:39.472
And that, too, is a fact.

1491
02:20:39.556 --> 02:20:42.058
Yeah! Yeah.

1492
02:20:52.319 --> 02:20:54.696
<i>Jake, it's crazy here.
It's full mobilization.</i>

1493
02:20:54.779 --> 02:20:56.406
<i>They're rigging the shuttle
as a bomber.</i>

1494
02:20:56.489 --> 02:20:58.742
<i>They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives.</i>

1495
02:20:58.825 --> 02:21:01.745
<i>It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign.</i>

1496
02:21:01.828 --> 02:21:03.705
Fricking daisy cutters!

1497
02:21:05.248 --> 02:21:06.541
<i>Quaritch has taken over.</i>

1498
02:21:06.625 --> 02:21:08.144
<i>He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.</i>

1499
02:21:08.168 --> 02:21:10.253
- When?
<i>- 0600 tomorrow.</i>

1500
02:21:10.337 --> 02:21:11.671
<i>- Max! Max!
- I gotta go.</i>

1501
02:21:13.965 --> 02:21:15.550
We're screwed!

1502
02:21:17.052 --> 02:21:19.220
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

1503
02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:21.139
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1504
02:21:23.016 --> 02:21:26.394
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1505
02:21:29.397 --> 02:21:31.066
I have 15 clans out there.

1506
02:21:32.108 --> 02:21:33.860
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1507
02:21:35.737 --> 02:21:37.155
Now, we know these mountains.

1508
02:21:37.238 --> 02:21:40.450
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1509
02:21:41.242 --> 02:21:43.036
Their instruments won't work up here.

1510
02:21:43.119 --> 02:21:45.288
Missile tracking won't work.

1511
02:21:45.789 --> 02:21:47.290
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1512
02:21:47.374 --> 02:21:49.668
If they bring the fight to us,

1513
02:21:49.751 --> 02:21:51.231
then we have
the home-field advantage.

1514
02:21:53.505 --> 02:21:55.090
You know he's gonna
commit that bomber

1515
02:21:55.173 --> 02:21:56.549
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1516
02:21:57.050 --> 02:21:58.385
Yeah, I know.

1517
02:21:58.468 --> 02:22:00.845
If they get to the Tree of Souls,
it's over.

1518
02:22:00.929 --> 02:22:04.140
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1519
02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:05.892
It'll destroy them.

1520
02:22:06.976 --> 02:22:08.812
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1521
02:22:24.661 --> 02:22:27.664
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1522
02:22:29.833 --> 02:22:31.501
But if you're there,

1523
02:22:33.294 --> 02:22:34.879
I need to give you a heads-up.

1524
02:22:37.215 --> 02:22:38.591
If Grace is with you,

1525
02:22:40.343 --> 02:22:41.761
look into her memories.

1526
02:22:42.971 --> 02:22:44.764
See the world we come from.

1527
02:22:46.141 --> 02:22:47.726
There's no green there.

1528
02:22:49.519 --> 02:22:51.312
They killed their Mother.

1529
02:22:52.313 --> 02:22:54.107
And they're gonna do the same here.

1530
02:22:56.359 --> 02:22:58.278
More Sky People are gonna come.

1531
02:22:59.028 --> 02:23:01.614
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1532
02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:04.993
Unless we stop them.

1533
02:23:07.662 --> 02:23:10.665
Look, you chose me for something.

1534
02:23:12.125 --> 02:23:14.002
I will stand and fight.

1535
02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:16.671
You know I will.

1536
02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:21.050
But I need a little help here.

1537
02:23:27.557 --> 02:23:30.602
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1538
02:23:32.479 --> 02:23:35.940
She protects only the balance of life.

1539
02:23:47.619 --> 02:23:49.329
It was worth a try.

1540
02:24:20.109 --> 02:24:22.029
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

1541
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:25.448
Yeah! Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about, man!

1542
02:24:37.544 --> 02:24:40.296
<i>This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.</i>

1543
02:24:41.297 --> 02:24:42.966
<i>Switch to manual flight mode.</i>

1544
02:24:43.049 --> 02:24:44.759
<i>Copy. Manual flight mode.</i>

1545
02:25:19.794 --> 02:25:21.671
This is Papa Dragon.

1546
02:25:21.754 --> 02:25:23.339
I want this mission high and tight.

1547
02:25:23.423 --> 02:25:24.924
I want to be home for dinner.

1548
02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:33.892
Suit Team, go.

1549
02:25:33.975 --> 02:25:36.311
<i>All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!</i>

1550
02:25:46.988 --> 02:25:48.573
Move, move, move!

1551
02:25:53.912 --> 02:25:55.705
<i>Bravo 1-1, move left.</i>

1552
02:25:56.247 --> 02:25:58.041
<i>Bravo 1-1 moving left.</i>

1553
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.001
<i>Watch flank.</i>

1554
02:26:02.003 --> 02:26:04.255
<i>Watch formation. Keep moving.</i>

1555
02:26:04.339 --> 02:26:05.548
<i>Roger that.</i>

1556
02:26:05.632 --> 02:26:08.051
<i>Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.</i>

1557
02:26:08.134 --> 02:26:09.427
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

1558
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:11.346
Eyes up. Check that overhead.

1559
02:26:12.722 --> 02:26:14.223
And watch those thermal scans.

1560
02:26:14.807 --> 02:26:18.102
<i>All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target.</i>

1561
02:26:18.186 --> 02:26:20.897
<i>Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.</i>

1562
02:26:25.735 --> 02:26:27.737
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1563
02:26:29.238 --> 02:26:31.824
<i>Gun crews,
keep your head on a swivel.</i>

1564
02:26:31.908 --> 02:26:35.036
<i>Make no mistake, people,
they're out there.</i>

1565
02:26:36.496 --> 02:26:38.539
All right, people, target in sight.

1566
02:26:38.623 --> 02:26:39.707
Range, four klicks.

1567
02:26:39.791 --> 02:26:42.085
Valkyrie 1 -6, get your payload ready.

1568
02:26:42.168 --> 02:26:43.336
Copy. Prepare to offload.

1569
02:26:43.419 --> 02:26:44.879
Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1570
02:26:45.421 --> 02:26:47.507
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1571
02:26:50.009 --> 02:26:51.094
Hold!

1572
02:26:58.977 --> 02:27:01.020
<i>Charlie 2-1, got big movement.</i>

1573
02:27:01.104 --> 02:27:02.790
- Hold position.
<i>- Hold up, hold up.</i>

1574
02:27:02.814 --> 02:27:04.607
We got movement out there,
500 meters.

1575
02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:06.317
<i>Charlie 2-1, hold position.</i>

1576
02:27:12.949 --> 02:27:14.283
Sir, ground has movement!

1577
02:27:14.784 --> 02:27:15.868
Fast approaching.

1578
02:27:15.952 --> 02:27:17.537
<i>Charlie Oscar, Rider section.</i>

1579
02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:18.621
Firing line!

1580
02:27:18.871 --> 02:27:21.541
<i>Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.</i>

1581
02:27:22.208 --> 02:27:23.459
Can't you clean it up?

1582
02:27:23.543 --> 02:27:25.169
No, sir. It's the Flux.

1583
02:27:53.406 --> 02:27:55.658
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1584
02:28:37.617 --> 02:28:40.453
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1585
02:28:41.662 --> 02:28:42.914
Break right. Come around.

1586
02:28:46.459 --> 02:28:47.668
Light them up!

1587
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:57.845
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1588
02:29:04.894 --> 02:29:06.813
Yeah! Get some!

1589
02:29:45.893 --> 02:29:47.770
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1590
02:29:58.489 --> 02:30:00.283
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1591
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:03.035
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1592
02:30:03.703 --> 02:30:04.787
Copy. Get out of there.

1593
02:30:09.876 --> 02:30:11.377
That's him. Get after him!

1594
02:30:28.227 --> 02:30:29.228
Take him out!

1595
02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:35.359
Oops.

1596
02:30:37.820 --> 02:30:38.905
Light her up!

1597
02:30:48.789 --> 02:30:50.082
Right there!

1598
02:30:50.166 --> 02:30:51.959
You're not the only one
with a gun, bitch.

1599
02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:54.313
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

1600
02:30:54.337 --> 02:30:55.421
Arming all pods.

1601
02:31:01.219 --> 02:31:02.220
That's it!

1602
02:31:32.708 --> 02:31:33.709
Seyzey!

1603
02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:39.859
<i>Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.</i>

1604
02:32:40.901 --> 02:32:42.403
Sorry, Jake.

1605
02:32:59.587 --> 02:33:00.713
Fire.

1606
02:33:18.606 --> 02:33:21.192
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1607
02:33:23.986 --> 02:33:25.446
Rogue One, you copy?

1608
02:33:27.615 --> 02:33:28.783
Trudy!

1609
02:33:39.668 --> 02:33:41.003
Time to target, two minutes.

1610
02:33:41.087 --> 02:33:43.839
Valkyrie 1 -6, you are cleared and hot.

1611
02:33:43.923 --> 02:33:46.092
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1612
02:33:51.931 --> 02:33:53.432
Arm number one!

1613
02:33:54.016 --> 02:33:55.935
Number one armed!

1614
02:33:57.103 --> 02:33:58.020
<i>Ma</i> Jake!

1615
02:34:00.314 --> 02:34:01.482
I read you.

1616
02:34:10.616 --> 02:34:11.659
<i>Neytiri!</i>

1617
02:34:11.742 --> 02:34:13.119
Seyzey's dead.

1618
02:34:13.202 --> 02:34:15.162
They are very close. They are many.

1619
02:34:17.123 --> 02:34:18.290
Do not attack.

1620
02:34:19.208 --> 02:34:20.751
<i>Do you read me, Neytiri?</i>

1621
02:34:23.754 --> 02:34:25.005
Do not attack!

1622
02:34:25.381 --> 02:34:27.299
<i>Fall back now. Get out of there!</i>

1623
02:34:27.383 --> 02:34:28.551
<i>That's an order!</i>

1624
02:34:36.058 --> 02:34:37.852
<i>Neytiri!</i>

1625
02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:41.856
<i>I got movement,
I got movement.</i>

1626
02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:43.399
<i>Hold position.</i>

1627
02:34:43.482 --> 02:34:44.876
<i>- Something's coming.</i>
<i>- Bravo 1-1,</i>

1628
02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:45.961
<i>I got a big seating. Turn screens over.</i>

1629
02:34:45.985 --> 02:34:47.361
We got movement 200 meters.

1630
02:34:47.444 --> 02:34:48.445
<i>Hold your formation.</i>

1631
02:34:48.529 --> 02:34:50.030
<i>- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks.</i>

1632
02:34:55.161 --> 02:34:56.745
<i>Hundred meters and closing fast.</i>

1633
02:35:13.345 --> 02:35:14.722
We gotta get out of here!

1634
02:35:22.688 --> 02:35:24.416
- Fall back! Fall back!
<i>- Move! Move! Move!</i>

1635
02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:26.984
<i>Fall back! On the run! On the run!</i>

1636
02:35:34.116 --> 02:35:36.744
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1637
02:35:43.542 --> 02:35:45.502
Eywa has heard you!

1638
02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:57.223
Come on!

1639
02:36:09.568 --> 02:36:11.278
Fall back! Move! Move!

1640
02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:38.639
Sir! All escorts
are down or falling back.

1641
02:36:38.722 --> 02:36:40.224
Let's get this done.

1642
02:36:41.141 --> 02:36:42.851
Valkyrie 1 -6, this is Dragon.

1643
02:36:42.935 --> 02:36:44.645
<i>Press to target.</i>

1644
02:36:44.728 --> 02:36:45.813
Copy. Pressing to target.

1645
02:36:45.896 --> 02:36:47.898
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1646
02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:10.129
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1647
02:37:10.212 --> 02:37:11.797
Drop! Drop! Drop!

1648
02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:13.090
Go, go, go, go!

1649
02:37:46.707 --> 02:37:47.833
Brace!

1650
02:38:04.892 --> 02:38:05.893
It's Sully.

1651
02:38:19.948 --> 02:38:21.033
Mask on!

1652
02:38:21.116 --> 02:38:22.242
Breach alarm!

1653
02:41:06.531 --> 02:41:08.367
Come on. Come to papa.

1654
02:41:36.103 --> 02:41:37.562
Give it up, Quaritch!

1655
02:41:40.774 --> 02:41:41.942
It's all over.

1656
02:41:43.527 --> 02:41:45.696
<i>Nothing's over while I'm breathing.</i>

1657
02:41:46.071 --> 02:41:47.698
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1658
02:42:43.045 --> 02:42:45.213
Come on!

1659
02:43:01.688 --> 02:43:02.731
Hey, Sully,

1660
02:43:03.523 --> 02:43:05.609
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1661
02:43:10.322 --> 02:43:12.199
You think you're one of them?

1662
02:43:13.742 --> 02:43:15.243
Time to wake up.

1663
02:44:59.723 --> 02:45:00.724
Jake?

1664
02:45:14.362 --> 02:45:15.489
Jake.

1665
02:45:33.507 --> 02:45:34.591
Jake.

1666
02:45:50.899 --> 02:45:52.901
Jake! <i>Ma</i> Jake!

1667
02:46:34.568 --> 02:46:35.902
I See you.

1668
02:46:41.741 --> 02:46:42.909
I See you.

1669
02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:09.102
I See you, Brother.

1670
02:47:10.312 --> 02:47:11.646
Are The People safe?

1671
02:47:14.441 --> 02:47:15.692
They're safe.

1672
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:23.617
I can't...

1673
02:47:24.826 --> 02:47:26.870
I cannot lead The People.

1674
02:47:27.537 --> 02:47:29.706
You must lead them... Jakesully.

1675
02:47:31.166 --> 02:47:33.251
I'm not officer material.

1676
02:47:33.335 --> 02:47:34.878
It is decided.

1677
02:47:38.298 --> 02:47:39.549
Now...

1678
02:47:40.842 --> 02:47:43.178
...do the duty of <i>Olo'eyktan.</i>

1679
02:47:47.849 --> 02:47:49.559
I will not kill you.

1680
02:47:49.643 --> 02:47:50.977
It is the way!

1681
02:47:53.438 --> 02:47:54.939
And it is good.

1682
02:47:57.192 --> 02:47:59.027
I will be remembered.

1683
02:48:01.780 --> 02:48:05.825
I fought... with <i>Toruk Macto!</i>

1684
02:48:08.328 --> 02:48:10.163
And we were brothers.

1685
02:48:11.665 --> 02:48:15.752
And he... was my last shadow.

1686
02:49:02.173 --> 02:49:04.968
<i>The aliens went back
to their dying world.</i>

1687
02:49:07.178 --> 02:49:10.056
<i>Only a few were chosen to stay.</i>

1688
02:49:23.987 --> 02:49:25.507
You know this isn't over.

1689
02:49:38.835 --> 02:49:40.962
<i>The time of great sorrow
was ending.</i>

1690
02:49:43.381 --> 02:49:45.467
Toruk Macto <i>was no longer needed.</i>

1691
02:49:58.313 --> 02:50:02.192
<i>Well, I guess
this is my last video log.</i>

1692
02:50:04.110 --> 02:50:07.947
<i>'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm...</i>

1693
02:50:08.865 --> 02:50:10.909
<i>I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place.</i>

1694
02:50:15.371 --> 02:50:16.998
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1695
02:50:20.210 --> 02:50:22.212
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party.

1696
02:50:26.591 --> 02:50:28.426
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1697
02:50:31.554 --> 02:50:33.306
<i>This is Jake Sully signing off.</i>
