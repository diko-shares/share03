00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.074
When I was lying there in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:45.077
with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,

3
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.372
I started having these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.208
I was free.

5
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:58.007
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

6
00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.728
They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,

7
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.564
but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.

8
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.776
A VA check and 12 bucks
will get you a cup of coffee.

9
00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.612
I'm what they call... waitlisted.

10
00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:34.168
The Bengal Tiger, extinct for over
a century is making a comeback.

11
00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:38.505
These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
are the latest of a number of species

12
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.426
that have been cloned back
into existence in the past five years.

13
00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.723
I became a marine for the hardship.
To be hammered on the anvil of life.

14
00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:52.436
I told myself I can pass
any test a man can pass.

15
00:01:55.315 --> 00:02:00.778
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

16
00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:06.617
Let's get it straight, upfront.

17
00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.118
I don't want your pity.

18
00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.372
You want a fair deal,
you're on the wrong planet.

19
00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:18.796
The strong prey on the weak.

20
00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.215
That's just the way things are.

21
00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:24.593
And nobody does a damn thing.

22
00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:44.113
Get off! Get off of him!

23
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:49.368
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life
was a single thing worth fighting for.

24
00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:06.552
I hope you realized you just lost
yourself a customer.

25
00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:10.305
Candy-ass bitch.

26
00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:14.685
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.

27
00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.742
- It doesn't look like him.
- It's him.

28
00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:33.078
You Jake Sully?

29
00:03:33.163 --> 00:03:35.414
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

30
00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:37.457
It's about your brother.

31
00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:46.717
We're looking for Sully, T.

32
00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:49.720
In there.

33
00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:15.412
Jesus, Tommy.

34
00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.623
The strong prey on the weak.

35
00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.876
A guy with a knife took all
Tommy would ever be

36
00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:23.545
for the paper in his wallet.

37
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:27.716
The concern of the suits was touching.

38
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.303
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

39
00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:33.847
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

40
00:04:33.932 --> 00:04:38.393
And since your genome is identical
to his, you could step into his shoes,

41
00:04:39.604 --> 00:04:40.979
so to speak.

42
00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.691
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

43
00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:48.654
You could do something important.
You can make a difference.

44
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.827
And the pay is good.

45
00:04:56.454 --> 00:04:57.454
Very good.

46
00:04:58.706 --> 00:05:00.582
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

47
00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:03.669
He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space

48
00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:05.045
to find the answers.

49
00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.845
Me, I was just another dumb grunt getting
sent someplace he was gonna regret.

50
00:05:46.337 --> 00:05:47.796
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

51
00:05:48.923 --> 00:05:51.008
It doesn't feel like six years.

52
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.386
More like a fifth of tequila
and an ass-kicking.

53
00:06:07.358 --> 00:06:09.067
Are we there yet?

54
00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:11.403
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

55
00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.322
We're there.

56
00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:17.576
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

57
00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:20.454
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

58
00:06:20.538 --> 00:06:25.625
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks
provided for your convenience.

59
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.920
The staff thanks you in advance.

60
00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:44.603
Up ahead was Pandora.

61
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.941
You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.

62
00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:11.713
Valkyrie 1-6, copy...

63
00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:15.550
Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear
for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

64
00:07:15.843 --> 00:07:20.138
Copy, Venture Star. Go for
de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

65
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.619
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

66
00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.037
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

67
00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:47.833
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

68
00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:51.211
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

69
00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:55.674
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

70
00:07:55.758 --> 00:07:57.551
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

71
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:42.345
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

72
00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:45.891
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

73
00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:49.936
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

74
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:52.564
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

75
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:02.949
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

76
00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:15.128
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

77
00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:19.216
You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.

78
00:09:29.894 --> 00:09:32.771
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

79
00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:34.606
Well, well, ladies.

80
00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:37.776
Look at all this fresh meat!

81
00:09:43.658 --> 00:09:47.786
Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

82
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.412
fighting for freedom.

83
00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.629
Look out, hot rod!

84
00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:00.966
But out here they're just hired guns,

85
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.927
taking the money,
working for the company.

86
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.387
Check this out, man.

87
00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:07.472
Meals on wheels.

88
00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:11.685
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

89
00:10:12.353 --> 00:10:13.645
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

90
00:10:13.688 --> 00:10:15.272
Got it! Need them!

91
00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:26.825
You're not in Kansas anymore.

92
00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:33.164
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:37.002
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

94
00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:40.880
If there is a hell,

95
00:10:41.632 --> 00:10:46.261
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

96
00:10:47.096 --> 00:10:49.264
Out there, beyond that fence,

97
00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:53.685
every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

98
00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:56.938
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

99
00:10:58.816 --> 00:11:03.653
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

100
00:11:03.654 --> 00:11:06.031
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

101
00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:08.950
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

102
00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:13.330
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

103
00:11:13.956 --> 00:11:15.790
They are very hard to kill.

104
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:21.254
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

105
00:11:23.174 --> 00:11:24.966
I will not succeed.

106
00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:28.553
Not with all of you.

107
00:11:29.638 --> 00:11:31.681
If you wish to survive,

108
00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:34.642
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

109
00:11:35.436 --> 00:11:37.645
You've got to obey the rules.

110
00:11:38.439 --> 00:11:40.440
Pandora rules.

111
00:11:41.692 --> 00:11:43.401
Rule number one...

112
00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:45.195
There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief

113
00:11:45.196 --> 00:11:46.946
to put your mind at ease.

114
00:11:49.283 --> 00:11:54.829
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

115
00:11:55.498 --> 00:11:57.749
Wow! You look just like him.

116
00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:01.586
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

117
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.671
Into the bio-lab.

118
00:12:04.382 --> 00:12:08.927
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

119
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:10.261
- Hi.
- Hey.

120
00:12:10.346 --> 00:12:11.947
Link... Here's the link room right here.

121
00:12:12.014 --> 00:12:14.307
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

122
00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:18.228
Me and Norm are here to drive

123
00:12:18.229 --> 00:12:21.439
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars.

124
00:12:21.524 --> 00:12:26.528
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

125
00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:28.571
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

126
00:12:28.656 --> 00:12:31.032
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

127
00:12:33.035 --> 00:12:34.911
Damn! They got big.

128
00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:37.539
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

129
00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:39.958
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

130
00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:41.918
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

131
00:12:42.002 --> 00:12:43.920
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

132
00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:45.880
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

133
00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:47.757
There's yours.

134
00:12:49.427 --> 00:12:51.094
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

135
00:12:51.095 --> 00:12:54.013
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

136
00:13:17.913 --> 00:13:19.414
Looks like him.

137
00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:22.500
No, it looks like you.

138
00:13:23.586 --> 00:13:25.545
This is your avatar now, Jake.

139
00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:33.178
And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,

140
00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:36.055
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

141
00:13:37.433 --> 00:13:38.892
or something.

142
00:13:40.227 --> 00:13:44.647
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

143
00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:47.567
which is insanely expensive.

144
00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:51.779
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

145
00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:54.032
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

146
00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:56.159
You know, what we see, what we feel.

147
00:13:56.243 --> 00:13:58.953
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.

148
00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:01.498
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

149
00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:04.334
All right. Whatever.

150
00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:07.962
So...

151
00:14:09.006 --> 00:14:10.465
Well, here I am,

152
00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:13.635
doing science.

153
00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:16.387
They're coming out!

154
00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:18.973
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

155
00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:27.649
Oh, God.

156
00:14:29.527 --> 00:14:31.319
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

157
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:37.700
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

158
00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:42.247
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.

159
00:14:42.331 --> 00:14:44.832
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

160
00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.710
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

161
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:50.004
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

162
00:14:50.548 --> 00:14:52.382
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

163
00:14:52.508 --> 00:14:56.177
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

164
00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.641
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

165
00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:04.936
May the All Mother...

166
00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:07.146
smile upon our first meeting.

167
00:15:07.147 --> 00:15:10.358
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

168
00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:13.820
I studied for five years...

169
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:15.905
but there is much to learn.

170
00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:19.617
- Grace? This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.

171
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.205
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

172
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.917
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

173
00:15:28.002 --> 00:15:29.419
He's dead.

174
00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.463
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

175
00:15:33.549 --> 00:15:36.884
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.

176
00:15:38.262 --> 00:15:41.472
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

177
00:15:41.557 --> 00:15:43.933
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

178
00:15:43.934 --> 00:15:45.268
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

179
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:47.895
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!

180
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.397
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

181
00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:52.358
He has no business
sticking his nose in my department.

182
00:15:53.402 --> 00:15:57.196
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

183
00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:09.459
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

184
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.337
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

185
00:16:18.218 --> 00:16:19.427
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

186
00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:21.596
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

187
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.599
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

188
00:16:27.478 --> 00:16:31.773
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

189
00:16:31.774 --> 00:16:34.817
but now I see
that you're intentionally screwing me.

190
00:16:34.818 --> 00:16:38.404
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

191
00:16:42.785 --> 00:16:46.287
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

192
00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:47.955
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

193
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.624
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

194
00:16:49.625 --> 00:16:51.668
How is this in any way lucky?

195
00:16:51.752 --> 00:16:53.503
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

196
00:16:53.587 --> 00:16:56.506
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

197
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.508
A Marine we can use.

198
00:16:58.592 --> 00:17:00.510
I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

199
00:17:00.511 --> 00:17:03.971
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

200
00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:06.015
Look, look,
you're supposed to be winning the hearts

201
00:17:06.016 --> 00:17:07.141
and the minds of the natives.

202
00:17:07.142 --> 00:17:09.018
Isn't that the whole point of
your little puppet show?

203
00:17:09.103 --> 00:17:10.645
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

204
00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:12.355
then they'll start trusting us.

205
00:17:12.439 --> 00:17:14.482
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

206
00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:16.526
but after, what, how many years?

207
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:18.194
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

208
00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:21.531
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

209
00:17:21.532 --> 00:17:23.658
Right. Come here.

210
00:17:24.743 --> 00:17:26.494
I can't... I can't...

211
00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:32.709
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

212
00:17:32.793 --> 00:17:35.878
Because this little gray rock sells
for 20 million a kilo.

213
00:17:35.963 --> 00:17:39.173
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

214
00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:41.175
It's what pays for your science.

215
00:17:42.553 --> 00:17:45.722
Now, those savages
are threatening our whole operation,

216
00:17:45.723 --> 00:17:47.056
we're on the brink of war,

217
00:17:47.057 --> 00:17:50.351
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

218
00:17:50.352 --> 00:17:53.896
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

219
00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:07.368
So, how much link time have you logged?

220
00:18:07.369 --> 00:18:11.080
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.

221
00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:15.460
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

222
00:18:15.544 --> 00:18:18.212
Zip. But I read a manual.

223
00:18:19.173 --> 00:18:21.215
Tell me you're joking.

224
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:23.926
This is cool.

225
00:18:24.386 --> 00:18:25.803
Let's go.

226
00:18:29.725 --> 00:18:31.434
Don't. I got this.

227
00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:38.441
So you just figured you'd come out here,

228
00:18:38.442 --> 00:18:41.068
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

229
00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:44.906
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

230
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.325
What was going through your head?

231
00:18:47.409 --> 00:18:50.244
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

232
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.623
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

233
00:18:54.082 --> 00:18:58.377
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

234
00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:03.257
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

235
00:19:03.967 --> 00:19:05.927
That shouldn't be hard for you.

236
00:19:05.928 --> 00:19:07.762
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

237
00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.305
Initiate link.

238
00:19:10.098 --> 00:19:12.642
Run sequence unit three. Go.

239
00:19:12.643 --> 00:19:14.101
Launching.

240
00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:21.025
I have the first congruency.

241
00:19:29.451 --> 00:19:34.997
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
- Go figure.

242
00:19:34.998 --> 00:19:36.999
Phase-lock 40%.

243
00:19:40.963 --> 00:19:42.547
All right. Going in.

244
00:19:43.173 --> 00:19:44.757
I'm going in in four.

245
00:19:47.803 --> 00:19:50.429
Phase-lock 99%. Link is stable.

246
00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:11.200
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

247
00:20:11.201 --> 00:20:12.827
Pupillary reflex is good.

248
00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:18.624
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

249
00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:20.710
Hey, guys.

250
00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.379
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

251
00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.839
Good!

252
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.340
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

253
00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:28.551
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

254
00:20:28.635 --> 00:20:30.011
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

255
00:20:30.095 --> 00:20:31.679
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

256
00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:33.931
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,

257
00:20:34.016 --> 00:20:35.349
- that's fine.
- Okay, good. Just take it

258
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.352
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

259
00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:40.176
Are you feeling lightheaded
or dizzy at all?

260
00:20:40.189 --> 00:20:41.939
You're wiggling your toes!

261
00:20:42.024 --> 00:20:43.774
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

262
00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:48.362
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

263
00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:51.115
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

264
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.772
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

265
00:20:53.827 --> 00:20:56.078
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

266
00:20:56.163 --> 00:20:58.748
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

267
00:20:58.749 --> 00:21:00.917
- so take it easy.
- Wait.

268
00:21:00.918 --> 00:21:02.418
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

269
00:21:02.502 --> 00:21:04.879
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

270
00:21:05.547 --> 00:21:07.267
- I need you to sit down. Jake!
- It's okay.

271
00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:09.091
- Buddy, listen to me.
- It's all good. I got this.

272
00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:12.887
- Jake, you need to sit down right now.
- Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

273
00:21:12.888 --> 00:21:15.097
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

274
00:21:15.098 --> 00:21:17.934
You need time to adjust to the avatar...
Whoa! Jake!

275
00:21:18.018 --> 00:21:20.269
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

276
00:21:20.354 --> 00:21:24.440
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand
milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

277
00:21:24.524 --> 00:21:26.817
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

278
00:21:26.902 --> 00:21:27.902
By the numbers.

279
00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.466
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me.

280
00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:31.072
You're not used to your avatar body.

281
00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.907
- This is dangerous.
- This is great.

282
00:21:32.908 --> 00:21:36.202
- Jake? Jake, listen to me.
- Come on. They're gonna put you out.

283
00:21:38.747 --> 00:21:41.415
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

284
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.084
God damn it! Bring them home!

285
00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:45.836
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

286
00:21:47.589 --> 00:21:51.425
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

287
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.111
I don't even have to play defense on it.

288
00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:54.679
Hey, guys. Hey.

289
00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:57.098
- It's okay, I'll get him.
- Jake, you have to come back!

290
00:21:57.099 --> 00:21:58.933
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

291
00:22:01.478 --> 00:22:03.104
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

292
00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:04.605
Come on!

293
00:22:05.732 --> 00:22:08.609
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

294
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.538
- Jeez! Sorry.
- Watch it!

295
00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:44.311
Hey, Marine!

296
00:22:45.147 --> 00:22:46.564
Damn.

297
00:22:48.608 --> 00:22:51.777
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

298
00:22:52.988 --> 00:22:54.530
Think fast.

299
00:22:55.323 --> 00:22:57.533
Motor control's looking good.

300
00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:11.756
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

301
00:23:12.424 --> 00:23:14.008
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

302
00:23:14.009 --> 00:23:15.509
Hey, hey, hey!

303
00:23:16.011 --> 00:23:18.220
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

304
00:23:18.305 --> 00:23:19.847
That's kind of freaky.

305
00:23:19.848 --> 00:23:22.349
Come on. Scat.

306
00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:24.685
Good night.

307
00:23:26.396 --> 00:23:29.523
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

308
00:23:53.548 --> 00:23:54.590
Welcome back.

309
00:24:02.557 --> 00:24:04.892
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

310
00:24:06.603 --> 00:24:11.899
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

311
00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:14.110
Hold on a second.

312
00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:17.571
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

313
00:24:17.989 --> 00:24:22.118
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

314
00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:24.787
Vine strike's still loose.

315
00:24:24.871 --> 00:24:27.123
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

316
00:24:27.124 --> 00:24:28.499
Watch it!

317
00:24:29.126 --> 00:24:31.847
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

318
00:24:31.878 --> 00:24:33.629
Or the biggest.

319
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.465
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

320
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.384
I thought you'd never ask.

321
00:24:39.719 --> 00:24:42.888
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

322
00:24:53.608 --> 00:24:55.985
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

323
00:24:56.069 --> 00:24:58.696
This low gravity'll make you soft.

324
00:25:00.115 --> 00:25:01.657
You get soft,

325
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:08.205
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

326
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:11.834
I pulled your record, Corporal.

327
00:25:11.918 --> 00:25:14.336
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

328
00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:18.632
Nothing like this here, though.

329
00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:24.305
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

330
00:25:24.306 --> 00:25:26.223
I figured it's just another hellhole.

331
00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:28.726
I was First Recon myself.

332
00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.021
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

333
00:25:32.981 --> 00:25:35.900
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

334
00:25:35.984 --> 00:25:37.443
I come out here?

335
00:25:38.236 --> 00:25:41.488
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail louie?

336
00:25:41.573 --> 00:25:46.160
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

337
00:25:46.828 --> 00:25:51.916
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

338
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.835
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

339
00:25:56.838 --> 00:26:02.760
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

340
00:26:02.844 --> 00:26:09.850
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

341
00:26:09.851 --> 00:26:11.518
- Clear!
- Clear!

342
00:26:16.691 --> 00:26:21.904
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

343
00:26:21.905 --> 00:26:23.572
Give me the goose bumps.

344
00:26:23.657 --> 00:26:27.076
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

345
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.869
right on the ground.

346
00:26:30.163 --> 00:26:32.081
Right in the hostiles' camp.

347
00:26:32.874 --> 00:26:38.212
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

348
00:26:38.296 --> 00:26:40.047
I want you to gain their trust.

349
00:26:40.048 --> 00:26:41.882
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

350
00:26:41.883 --> 00:26:44.426
or hammer them hard if they won't.

351
00:26:45.887 --> 00:26:48.222
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

352
00:26:48.223 --> 00:26:52.393
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

353
00:26:53.895 --> 00:26:55.479
but you report to me.

354
00:26:56.898 --> 00:26:58.691
Can you do that for me, son?

355
00:27:00.235 --> 00:27:01.610
Hell, yeah, sir.

356
00:27:02.529 --> 00:27:04.321
Well, all right, then.

357
00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:18.294
Son, I take care of my own.

358
00:27:18.295 --> 00:27:19.420
You get me what I need,

359
00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:22.756
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

360
00:27:23.633 --> 00:27:25.134
Your real legs.

361
00:27:27.804 --> 00:27:29.930
That sounds real good, sir.

362
00:27:36.563 --> 00:27:39.273
- Link's ready!
- Phase-lock 40%.

363
00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:42.985
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

364
00:27:43.069 --> 00:27:46.613
I have five congruencies. Phase-lock 90%.

365
00:27:46.698 --> 00:27:48.032
Link three ready.

366
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.367
All right, I'm going in.

367
00:28:22.275 --> 00:28:24.526
Sturmbeest herd
coming up on your right.

368
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.403
Got it! Thanks.

369
00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:30.991
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows
and some juveniles.

370
00:29:19.082 --> 00:29:21.458
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

371
00:29:24.921 --> 00:29:28.715
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

372
00:29:31.344 --> 00:29:35.347
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

373
00:29:37.767 --> 00:29:39.435
You the man, Doc.

374
00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:19.141
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

375
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.189
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

376
00:30:30.737 --> 00:30:33.363
So, how will they know we're here?

377
00:30:33.406 --> 00:30:36.116
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

378
00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:42.206
This was our school.

379
00:30:42.248 --> 00:30:45.542
Now it's just... storage.

380
00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:48.295
The kids were so bright.

381
00:30:49.005 --> 00:30:50.214
Eager to learn.

382
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.799
They picked up English
faster than I could teach it.

383
00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.221
So, we'll take a couple of
these Ph monitors...

384
00:30:57.513 --> 00:30:59.431
and a soil probe.

385
00:31:00.099 --> 00:31:04.978
That little yellow case back there.
The old microscope.

386
00:31:06.022 --> 00:31:07.105
Here.

387
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.774
Oh, yeah. I love this one.

388
00:31:09.317 --> 00:31:10.984
The stingbats knocked them down.

389
00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:22.287
I keep hoping someone will
come back in and read them.

390
00:31:22.372 --> 00:31:24.081
Why don't they come back?

391
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.172
The Omaticaya... learned as much
about us as they needed to.

392
00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:38.512
What happened here?

393
00:31:42.475 --> 00:31:45.477
Are you going to help us with this gear?
We've got a lot to do.

394
00:32:00.076 --> 00:32:02.035
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

395
00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:08.041
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

396
00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:13.630
Wow! It's that fast?

397
00:32:15.883 --> 00:32:17.968
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

398
00:32:18.052 --> 00:32:21.847
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

399
00:32:21.931 --> 00:32:25.559
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

400
00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:27.311
Okay. Sample.

401
00:32:29.355 --> 00:32:33.650
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

402
00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:38.280
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

403
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.532
Right.

404
00:33:08.311 --> 00:33:10.187
So, here I go.

405
00:33:35.671 --> 00:33:39.508
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

406
00:33:43.262 --> 00:33:44.846
It's already pissed off.

407
00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:47.974
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

408
00:33:53.815 --> 00:33:57.901
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

409
00:33:58.528 --> 00:34:00.320
So, what do I do, dance with it?

410
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.865
Just hold your ground.

411
00:34:18.965 --> 00:34:21.341
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

412
00:34:22.468 --> 00:34:24.428
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

413
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.848
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

414
00:34:29.392 --> 00:34:31.977
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

415
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:34.980
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

416
00:34:35.064 --> 00:34:38.066
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

417
00:34:41.154 --> 00:34:42.279
Oh, shit.

418
00:34:54.083 --> 00:34:56.585
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

419
00:34:58.004 --> 00:35:00.046
Run! Definitely run!

420
00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:47.816
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

421
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.819
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

422
00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.865
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to
hang on till morning.

423
00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.492
He won't make it till morning.

424
00:40:50.397 --> 00:40:52.357
I don't have all goddamn night.

425
00:40:53.192 --> 00:40:55.276
Come on! Come on!

426
00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:10.852
Hey, wait. Don't!

427
00:42:14.356 --> 00:42:15.481
Great.

428
00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:16.501
Look, I know you probably don't
understand this,

429
00:43:22.591 --> 00:43:23.841
but thank you.

430
00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:30.431
Thank you.

431
00:43:34.395 --> 00:43:35.895
That was pretty impressive.

432
00:43:38.607 --> 00:43:41.567
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was...

433
00:43:45.114 --> 00:43:48.241
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

434
00:43:49.243 --> 00:43:50.702
Wait up!

435
00:43:51.453 --> 00:43:53.287
Just... Hey, slow down.

436
00:43:53.288 --> 00:43:56.374
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

437
00:43:57.459 --> 00:44:00.503
- Damn!
- Don't thank.

438
00:44:01.422 --> 00:44:03.798
You don't thank for this.

439
00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:09.303
This is sad. Very sad only.

440
00:44:10.222 --> 00:44:12.306
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

441
00:44:13.142 --> 00:44:14.976
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

442
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.649
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

443
00:44:22.484 --> 00:44:24.569
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

444
00:44:24.653 --> 00:44:26.320
Your fault!

445
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.490
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

446
00:44:29.575 --> 00:44:33.327
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

447
00:44:33.328 --> 00:44:34.829
Easy.

448
00:44:37.082 --> 00:44:39.500
Fine. Fine.

449
00:44:40.669 --> 00:44:42.795
If you love your little forest friends,

450
00:44:44.339 --> 00:44:46.174
why not let them just kill my ass?

451
00:44:47.176 --> 00:44:48.968
What's the thinking?

452
00:44:49.762 --> 00:44:52.472
- Why save you?
- Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

453
00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:58.853
You have a strong heart.

454
00:45:00.981 --> 00:45:02.190
No fear.

455
00:45:06.695 --> 00:45:09.572
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

456
00:45:15.996 --> 00:45:18.414
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

457
00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:21.292
Look, maybe you should teach me.

458
00:45:21.376 --> 00:45:23.586
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

459
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.588
Well, then teach me how to See.

460
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:28.132
- No one can teach you to See.
- Whoa.

461
00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.886
Look, come on, can't we talk?

462
00:45:32.846 --> 00:45:36.724
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

463
00:45:41.563 --> 00:45:42.396
You're like a baby.

464
00:45:42.397 --> 00:45:43.272
You're like a baby.

465
00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:51.072
I need your help.

466
00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:54.033
You should not be here.

467
00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:57.787
- Okay, take me with you.
- No! Go back.

468
00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:01.499
No.

469
00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:04.252
Go back.

470
00:46:25.858 --> 00:46:26.899
No!

471
00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:49.881
What...

472
00:46:53.635 --> 00:46:55.136
What are they?

473
00:46:56.471 --> 00:46:58.472
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

474
00:46:59.516 --> 00:47:01.184
Very pure spirits.

475
00:47:25.292 --> 00:47:27.251
What was that all about?

476
00:47:29.338 --> 00:47:30.463
Come.

477
00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:33.007
Come!

478
00:47:35.177 --> 00:47:36.510
Where are we going?

479
00:47:47.022 --> 00:47:48.105
Come.

480
00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:04.997
What's your name?

481
00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:06.165
Shit!

482
00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:32.775
Okay.

483
00:48:35.487 --> 00:48:38.364
Calm people, calm.

484
00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:46.956
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

485
00:48:49.418 --> 00:48:52.336
These demons are forbidden here.

486
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.464
There has been a sign.

487
00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:57.800
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

488
00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:03.639
Bring him.

489
00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.726
What's going on?

490
00:49:09.062 --> 00:49:10.187
Wait.

491
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.775
What's happening?

492
00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:16.652
Hey!

493
00:50:26.848 --> 00:50:28.182
Father...

494
00:50:29.017 --> 00:50:30.810
I see you.

495
00:50:42.531 --> 00:50:43.948
This creature...

496
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:47.326
why do you bring him here?

497
00:50:48.787 --> 00:50:50.162
I was going to kill him...

498
00:50:50.455 --> 00:50:52.289
but there was a sign from Eywa.

499
00:50:52.457 --> 00:50:54.542
I have said...

500
00:50:54.543 --> 00:50:57.211
no dreamwalker will come here.

501
00:50:57.295 --> 00:50:58.629
What's he saying?

502
00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:01.465
His alien smell fills my nose.

503
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:02.633
Hey, what's he saying?

504
00:51:02.634 --> 00:51:04.885
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

505
00:51:06.513 --> 00:51:09.473
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

506
00:51:13.145 --> 00:51:14.645
Step back!

507
00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:20.192
I will look at this alien.

508
00:51:20.318 --> 00:51:21.610
That is Mother.

509
00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:25.614
She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

510
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.825
Who's Eywa?

511
00:51:34.666 --> 00:51:36.417
What are you called?

512
00:51:37.335 --> 00:51:38.711
Jake Sully.

513
00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:51.432
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.

514
00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:55.769
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

515
00:51:55.854 --> 00:51:59.190
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

516
00:52:00.692 --> 00:52:03.027
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

517
00:52:04.237 --> 00:52:06.906
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

518
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.449
What are you?

519
00:52:10.702 --> 00:52:13.913
I was a Marine. A...

520
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:17.416
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

521
00:52:17.876 --> 00:52:19.210
A warrior!

522
00:52:19.211 --> 00:52:20.794
I could kill him easily!

523
00:52:20.795 --> 00:52:22.087
I could kill him easily! No!

524
00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:26.717
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

525
00:52:26.718 --> 00:52:28.677
we have seen.

526
00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:31.555
We need to learn more about him.

527
00:52:33.975 --> 00:52:35.935
My Daughter...

528
00:52:35.936 --> 00:52:40.314
you will teach him our way...

529
00:52:40.315 --> 00:52:43.776
to speak and walk as we do.

530
00:52:43.777 --> 00:52:47.404
Why me? That's not fair...

531
00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:52.326
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

532
00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:55.996
Learn well, Jakesully.

533
00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:00.584
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

534
00:53:19.312 --> 00:53:20.771
Good evening.

535
00:53:23.817 --> 00:53:25.609
Please don't get up.

536
00:53:27.445 --> 00:53:28.779
Excuse me.

537
00:53:31.116 --> 00:53:32.283
Sorry.

538
00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:37.079
Hey, how you doing?

539
00:53:45.672 --> 00:53:46.672
Thank you.

540
00:53:49.217 --> 00:53:51.552
You know, I don't
even know your name.

541
00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:54.680
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

542
00:53:56.975 --> 00:53:58.892
Again, a whole lot slower?

543
00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:00.227
Neytiri.

544
00:54:00.312 --> 00:54:01.937
Neytili.

545
00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:04.231
Neytiri.

546
00:54:04.691 --> 00:54:06.608
Neytiri.

547
00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:09.611
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.

548
00:54:10.238 --> 00:54:11.488
It's nice.

549
00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:56.617
- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha.

550
00:54:56.701 --> 00:54:59.745
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake. Jake!

551
00:55:01.539 --> 00:55:04.625
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

552
00:55:06.294 --> 00:55:08.962
There you go. There you go, there you go.

553
00:55:09.047 --> 00:55:11.423
You're okay. You're okay.

554
00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:14.426
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

555
00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:20.057
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.

556
00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:23.894
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

557
00:55:24.896 --> 00:55:27.898
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

558
00:55:27.982 --> 00:55:32.111
disappearing into the brush with
this angry thanator coming after him.

559
00:55:32.112 --> 00:55:35.114
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

560
00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.574
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

561
00:55:37.575 --> 00:55:40.911
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

562
00:55:42.247 --> 00:55:43.747
"Jarhead clan"?

563
00:55:45.333 --> 00:55:48.377
- And it worked?
- Hey, I'm practically family.

564
00:55:49.462 --> 00:55:52.965
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

565
00:55:52.966 --> 00:55:54.633
That's called taking the initiative, son.

566
00:55:54.634 --> 00:55:57.177
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look, Sully. Sully.

567
00:55:57.262 --> 00:56:00.681
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

568
00:56:01.433 --> 00:56:07.271
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

569
00:56:07.272 --> 00:56:09.106
But no, no, no, they like mud.

570
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:13.152
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're...

571
00:56:13.736 --> 00:56:16.780
Hey, can you... Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

572
00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:21.785
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

573
00:56:21.786 --> 00:56:23.996
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

574
00:56:23.997 --> 00:56:30.169
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

575
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:35.549
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

576
00:56:39.304 --> 00:56:41.805
- Well, who gets them to move?
- Guess.

577
00:56:43.725 --> 00:56:47.269
- What if they won't go?
- I'm betting that they will.

578
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:50.481
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

579
00:56:51.316 --> 00:56:54.151
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

580
00:56:54.235 --> 00:56:57.988
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

581
00:56:58.072 --> 00:57:01.325
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

582
00:57:01.326 --> 00:57:04.536
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

583
00:57:05.288 --> 00:57:08.373
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

584
00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:12.669
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

585
00:57:12.754 --> 00:57:14.755
Well, we're wasting time.

586
00:57:15.715 --> 00:57:16.840
I like this guy.

587
00:57:17.008 --> 00:57:20.511
- Guys, right now...
- Okay, let's run through them again.

588
00:57:20.512 --> 00:57:22.846
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

589
00:57:24.891 --> 00:57:27.851
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

590
00:57:27.936 --> 00:57:31.104
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

591
00:57:31.189 --> 00:57:32.773
Got it.

592
00:57:32.857 --> 00:57:35.067
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

593
00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:37.861
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

594
00:57:39.906 --> 00:57:42.366
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.

595
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:44.451
They become a mated pair.

596
00:57:45.453 --> 00:57:47.704
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?

597
00:57:48.623 --> 00:57:52.209
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

598
00:57:52.293 --> 00:57:53.669
Everything they know!

599
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:55.837
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

600
00:57:55.922 --> 00:57:57.297
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

601
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.049
Come on. That's...

602
00:57:59.592 --> 00:58:01.718
Knock it off. It's like kindergarten
around here.

603
00:58:03.805 --> 00:58:06.765
Neytiri was my best student.

604
00:58:06.849 --> 00:58:09.851
She and her sister, Sylwanin.

605
00:58:09.936 --> 00:58:12.354
Just amazing girls.

606
00:58:12.438 --> 00:58:14.022
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

607
00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:15.983
She's dead.

608
00:58:19.862 --> 00:58:22.406
Let's go. Village life starts early.

609
00:58:24.617 --> 00:58:27.119
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

610
00:58:46.306 --> 00:58:47.639
Easy, boy.

611
00:58:48.266 --> 00:58:50.350
Pale is female.

612
00:58:53.313 --> 00:58:55.731
Okay. Easy, girl.

613
00:58:57.756 --> 00:59:00.756
SharePirate.Com-Movie Stream and Downloads

614
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:28.263
That is shahaylu. The bond.

615
00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:31.683
Feel her.

616
00:59:34.812 --> 00:59:38.940
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

617
00:59:41.944 --> 00:59:43.737
Feel her strong legs.

618
00:59:46.199 --> 00:59:48.533
You may tell her what to do.

619
00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:49.826
Inside.

620
00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:53.705
For now, say where to go.

621
00:59:56.709 --> 00:59:57.959
Forward!

622
01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:18.688
- You should go away.
- No, you'd miss me.

623
01:00:20.108 --> 01:00:22.401
I knew you could speak English.

624
01:00:24.987 --> 01:00:27.155
This alien will learn nothing...

625
01:00:27.573 --> 01:00:29.199
a rock sees more...

626
01:00:29.575 --> 01:00:31.451
look at him.

627
01:00:40.711 --> 01:00:41.795
Again.

628
01:00:41.879 --> 01:00:45.382
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

629
01:00:45.383 --> 01:00:47.884
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

630
01:00:47.969 --> 01:00:50.095
There's an outer row of columns.

631
01:00:50.096 --> 01:00:52.931
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

632
01:00:52.932 --> 01:00:56.560
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

633
01:00:57.437 --> 01:00:59.062
That's how they move up and down.

634
01:00:59.147 --> 01:01:02.065
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

635
01:01:02.066 --> 01:01:03.442
Roger that.

636
01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:06.236
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

637
01:01:06.237 --> 01:01:09.072
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

638
01:01:13.619 --> 01:01:17.080
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.

639
01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:22.627
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

640
01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:25.964
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

641
01:01:26.048 --> 01:01:28.008
way up in the mountains.

642
01:01:28.759 --> 01:01:31.136
The Hallelujah Mountains?

643
01:01:31.137 --> 01:01:33.430
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

644
01:01:33.514 --> 01:01:35.474
- Yeah.
- Yes!

645
01:01:38.936 --> 01:01:42.606
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

646
01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.996
We're getting close.

647
01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.790
Yeah, look at my instruments.

648
01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:03.835
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

649
01:02:03.836 --> 01:02:06.171
We're VFR from here on.

650
01:02:06.172 --> 01:02:08.131
What's VFR?

651
01:02:08.132 --> 01:02:10.509
Means you gotta see where you're going.

652
01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:14.513
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

653
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:35.659
Oh, my God.

654
01:02:46.671 --> 01:02:48.046
You should see your faces.

655
01:03:15.074 --> 01:03:17.492
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

656
01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:33.216
So what does hold them up?

657
01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:34.759
Grace explained it to me.

658
01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:37.429
Some kind of maglev effect.

659
01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:41.349
Because unobtanium is
a superconductor... or something.

660
01:04:03.914 --> 01:04:05.498
Welcome to camp.

661
01:04:09.337 --> 01:04:14.007
- So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

662
01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:17.344
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

663
01:04:17.428 --> 01:04:20.972
- Grace didn't miss a thing.
- Trudy, you'll take the top one.

664
01:04:20.973 --> 01:04:23.475
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

665
01:04:23.476 --> 01:04:27.187
But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,

666
01:04:27.188 --> 01:04:28.813
so she's playing nice.

667
01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:33.985
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

668
01:04:36.864 --> 01:04:40.950
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

669
01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:31.501
Holy shit!

670
01:05:32.378 --> 01:05:34.295
Do not look in her eye.

671
01:05:42.847 --> 01:05:44.556
Ikran is not horse.

672
01:05:45.725 --> 01:05:47.559
Once shahaylu is made,

673
01:05:51.439 --> 01:05:55.775
ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life.

674
01:06:05.703 --> 01:06:08.455
To become taronyu, hunter,

675
01:06:08.539 --> 01:06:12.125
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you.

676
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.713
- When?
- When you are ready.

677
01:07:07.097 --> 01:07:10.266
Okay. This is video log 12.

678
01:07:11.435 --> 01:07:13.144
Time's 2132.

679
01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:17.982
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack.

680
01:07:17.983 --> 01:07:20.860
No, now. When it's fresh.

681
01:07:23.489 --> 01:07:25.365
Okay, location, shack,

682
01:07:26.325 --> 01:07:28.660
and the days are starting to blur together.

683
01:07:30.788 --> 01:07:34.040
The language is a pain, but, you know,

684
01:07:34.041 --> 01:07:35.635
I figure it's like
field-stripping a weapon.

685
01:07:35.648 --> 01:07:37.252
Just repetition, repetition.

686
01:07:37.336 --> 01:07:39.003
- Navi.
- "Nari."

687
01:07:39.004 --> 01:07:41.339
- Nari.
- "Narrri"!

688
01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.632
Narrri!

689
01:07:43.551 --> 01:07:45.593
TxurnÌ'ul. Stronger.

690
01:07:50.182 --> 01:07:53.852
Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.

691
01:07:56.188 --> 01:07:57.689
This is a very important part of it.

692
01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.899
- Norm's attitude has improved lately.
- I see you. I see you.

693
01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:02.360
But it's not just,
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"

694
01:08:02.361 --> 01:08:04.028
it's "I see into you. I See you."

695
01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:06.781
It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

696
01:08:06.866 --> 01:08:09.117
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

697
01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:12.412
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

698
01:08:13.205 --> 01:08:16.791
My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day.

699
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:21.796
I have to trust my body
to know what to do.

700
01:08:26.886 --> 01:08:28.636
Yeah! Check it out!

701
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:30.722
Oh, crap!

702
01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:39.898
Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,

703
01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.150
the tiniest scents and sounds.

704
01:08:47.698 --> 01:08:52.493
She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

705
01:08:53.245 --> 01:08:55.955
I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final.

706
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.751
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know.

707
01:08:59.752 --> 01:09:02.462
You need to listen to what she says.

708
01:09:02.546 --> 01:09:05.757
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

709
01:09:05.758 --> 01:09:08.384
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

710
01:09:23.776 --> 01:09:26.361
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

711
01:09:27.613 --> 01:09:29.781
You gotta be kidding me.

712
01:09:58.811 --> 01:10:00.853
I talked Mo'at into
letting Grace into the village.

713
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.606
Look how big you are.

714
01:10:03.691 --> 01:10:04.607
It's the first time
since her school was closed down.

715
01:10:04.692 --> 01:10:06.442
You are so pretty.

716
01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:37.265
Come on, Marine.

717
01:11:02.499 --> 01:11:05.209
I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

718
01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:07.503
the people have to the forest.

719
01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:10.798
She talks about a network of energy

720
01:11:11.633 --> 01:11:14.218
that flows through all living things.

721
01:11:15.095 --> 01:11:18.431
She says all energy is only borrowed,

722
01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:21.934
and one day you have to give it back.

723
01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.478
You were in 16 hours today.

724
01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:10.358
You're still losing weight.

725
01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.531
No, you don't.

726
01:12:16.573 --> 01:12:19.325
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Come back here.

727
01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:22.995
Bon appétit.

728
01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.916
Today I made a kill.

729
01:12:27.835 --> 01:12:30.711
And we ate it. At least,
I know where that meal came from.

730
01:12:31.046 --> 01:12:35.216
Other body. You need to
take care of this body. Okay?

731
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.009
- Get it? Let's eat it.
- Yeah, yeah.

732
01:12:37.594 --> 01:12:40.012
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

733
01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:42.306
Give it to me.

734
01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:43.891
- You look like crap.
- Thank you.

735
01:12:43.976 --> 01:12:45.726
You're burning way too hard.

736
01:12:46.812 --> 01:12:48.646
Get rid of this shit.

737
01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:50.648
And then you can lecture me.

738
01:12:51.733 --> 01:12:54.443
Now, I'm telling you,
as your boss,

739
01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:59.240
and as someone who might even
consider being a friend someday

740
01:12:59.324 --> 01:13:01.742
to take some down time.

741
01:13:01.827 --> 01:13:03.578
Eat this, please.

742
01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.332
Trust me, I...
learned the hard way.

743
01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:25.516
What did happen at the school, Grace?

744
01:13:33.692 --> 01:13:39.322
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin,
stopped coming to school.

745
01:13:39.406 --> 01:13:41.449
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

746
01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:46.829
And one day, she and a couple of
other young hunters came running in

747
01:13:46.914 --> 01:13:50.041
all painted up.

748
01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.752
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

749
01:13:56.089 --> 01:13:58.966
I guess they thought
I could protect them.

750
01:14:01.762 --> 01:14:04.597
The troopers pursued them
to the school.

751
01:14:05.766 --> 01:14:07.975
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

752
01:14:08.018 --> 01:14:10.353
Right in front of Neytiri.

753
01:14:10.437 --> 01:14:11.604
And then shot the others.

754
01:14:14.399 --> 01:14:15.900
I got most of the kids out.

755
01:14:19.947 --> 01:14:21.572
But they never came back.

756
01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:26.410
I'm sorry.

757
01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:38.798
A scientist stays objective.

758
01:14:39.633 --> 01:14:43.511
We can't be ruled by emotion.

759
01:14:43.553 --> 01:14:46.764
But I put 10 years of my life
into that school.

760
01:14:47.766 --> 01:14:50.518
They called me sa'nok.

761
01:14:52.604 --> 01:14:53.604
Mother.

762
01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:54.689
Mother.

763
01:14:57.109 --> 01:15:01.529
That kind of pain
reaches back through the link.

764
01:15:26.972 --> 01:15:29.390
I see you... Brother

765
01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:32.059
and thank you.

766
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:38.065
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

767
01:15:38.608 --> 01:15:40.443
Your body stays behind...

768
01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:43.404
to become part of The People.

769
01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:48.576
A clean kill.

770
01:15:51.913 --> 01:15:53.414
You are ready.

771
01:16:19.066 --> 01:16:22.443
Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,

772
01:16:22.527 --> 01:16:25.112
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

773
01:16:27.324 --> 01:16:30.659
But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are.

774
01:16:31.495 --> 01:16:32.703
Oo-rah.

775
01:17:04.194 --> 01:17:05.444
Now what?

776
01:18:53.553 --> 01:18:55.512
Jakesully will go first.

777
01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:32.383
Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside.

778
01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:36.262
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

779
01:19:36.346 --> 01:19:39.223
You will have one chance, Jake.

780
01:19:39.224 --> 01:19:41.392
How will I know if he chooses me?

781
01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:43.435
He will try to kill you.

782
01:19:44.604 --> 01:19:46.021
Outstanding.

783
01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:47.708
Let's dance.

784
01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.716
That moron's going to die.

785
01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:21.533
Don't be afraid, warrior.

786
01:21:21.534 --> 01:21:23.035
Make the bond!

787
01:21:26.331 --> 01:21:27.373
No!

788
01:21:31.336 --> 01:21:32.461
Jake!

789
01:21:46.476 --> 01:21:48.102
Shahaylu, Jake.

790
01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.730
Shahaylu!

791
01:22:01.825 --> 01:22:02.950
Stop!

792
01:22:11.584 --> 01:22:16.672
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

793
01:22:29.894 --> 01:22:32.855
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

794
01:22:34.357 --> 01:22:36.525
- Think, "Fly!"
- Fly?

795
01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.410
God damn!

796
01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:52.082
Oh, shit!

797
01:23:01.551 --> 01:23:03.719
Shut up and fly straight!

798
01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:16.315
That's it. Bank left!

799
01:23:25.617 --> 01:23:27.409
Level out! That's it.

800
01:23:32.916 --> 01:23:34.249
Jakesully!

801
01:23:59.025 --> 01:24:00.108
Hey!

802
01:24:06.115 --> 01:24:07.449
Let's go!

803
01:24:19.879 --> 01:24:21.797
Yeah, baby, I got this!

804
01:24:22.632 --> 01:24:23.882
Oh, shit!

805
01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:32.933
I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.

806
01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:34.851
Yeah!

807
01:24:35.812 --> 01:24:38.981
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

808
01:24:38.982 --> 01:24:41.472
I turn. I feel the wind.
I turn very strong.

809
01:24:41.485 --> 01:24:43.986
Look, yeah, see, I
banked so hard...

810
01:25:46.049 --> 01:25:48.050
The Tree of Souls.

811
01:25:51.471 --> 01:25:53.680
It's their most sacred place.

812
01:25:54.432 --> 01:25:57.267
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

813
01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:59.436
Yeah, that's what messes up
my instruments.

814
01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:04.066
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

815
01:26:05.443 --> 01:26:07.527
I would die to get samples.

816
01:26:08.112 --> 01:26:10.947
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

817
01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.366
You lucky swine.

818
01:27:33.739 --> 01:27:34.823
Hell, yeah!

819
01:27:34.907 --> 01:27:36.450
Hell, yeah!

820
01:27:49.255 --> 01:27:52.966
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.

821
01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:57.304
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

822
01:28:01.267 --> 01:28:02.350
Dive!

823
01:28:25.124 --> 01:28:26.333
Go, go!

824
01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:35.842
Follow me!

825
01:29:22.265 --> 01:29:24.891
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

826
01:29:25.768 --> 01:29:28.812
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

827
01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:33.692
Yeah, right. It's the
last one you ever see.

828
01:29:38.281 --> 01:29:42.075
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto.

829
01:29:42.743 --> 01:29:44.536
Rider of Last Shadow.

830
01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:47.372
He rode this?

831
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.625
Toruk chose him.

832
01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:54.838
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

833
01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:56.923
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

834
01:29:57.633 --> 01:29:59.509
Toruk Macto was mighty.

835
01:30:01.345 --> 01:30:05.181
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

836
01:30:05.182 --> 01:30:07.517
All Na'vi people know the story.

837
01:30:14.233 --> 01:30:18.445
Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world

838
01:30:19.572 --> 01:30:21.573
and in here is the dream.

839
01:30:42.261 --> 01:30:44.971
It's hard to believe
it's only been three months.

840
01:30:48.017 --> 01:30:50.477
I can barely remember my old life.

841
01:30:54.023 --> 01:30:55.857
I don't know who I am anymore.

842
01:31:14.627 --> 01:31:17.462
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

843
01:31:20.633 --> 01:31:23.551
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

844
01:31:25.763 --> 01:31:28.264
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

845
01:31:30.851 --> 01:31:33.436
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

846
01:31:33.437 --> 01:31:35.313
No, I can do this.

847
01:31:35.398 --> 01:31:37.023
You already have.

848
01:31:37.942 --> 01:31:40.235
You give me good, usable intel.

849
01:31:40.236 --> 01:31:42.445
This Tree of Souls place.

850
01:31:42.905 --> 01:31:46.282
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

851
01:31:46.367 --> 01:31:48.118
which it will. Yeah.

852
01:31:49.078 --> 01:31:51.079
Now it's time to come in.

853
01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.416
By the way,

854
01:31:54.917 --> 01:31:56.918
you gonna get your legs back.

855
01:31:57.795 --> 01:32:01.464
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

856
01:32:01.465 --> 01:32:03.925
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

857
01:32:04.009 --> 01:32:05.802
I'm a man of my word.

858
01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:10.473
I gotta finish this.

859
01:32:12.768 --> 01:32:14.310
There's one more thing.

860
01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:19.983
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

861
01:32:22.486 --> 01:32:24.612
If I do it, I'm one of them.

862
01:32:26.115 --> 01:32:27.907
And they'll trust me.

863
01:32:31.537 --> 01:32:34.748
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

864
01:32:48.345 --> 01:32:50.847
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

865
01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:12.285
The Na'vi say
that every person is born twice.

866
01:33:14.288 --> 01:33:19.709
The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever.

867
01:33:25.216 --> 01:33:29.511
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

868
01:33:30.721 --> 01:33:33.973
You are part of The People.

869
01:34:20.271 --> 01:34:22.272
Come. Come.

870
01:34:39.915 --> 01:34:42.625
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

871
01:34:44.253 --> 01:34:46.129
And sometimes answered.

872
01:34:53.971 --> 01:34:56.681
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

873
01:34:57.683 --> 01:34:59.434
The Tree of Voices.

874
01:35:01.437 --> 01:35:03.605
The voices of our ancestors.

875
01:35:18.621 --> 01:35:20.204
I can hear them.

876
01:35:25.127 --> 01:35:26.753
They live, Jake,

877
01:35:28.797 --> 01:35:30.214
within Eywa.

878
01:35:34.386 --> 01:35:36.262
You are Omaticaya now.

879
01:35:36.972 --> 01:35:40.099
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

880
01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:47.690
And you may choose a woman.

881
01:35:49.818 --> 01:35:51.778
We have many fine women.

882
01:35:52.988 --> 01:35:54.989
Ninat is the best singer.

883
01:35:57.868 --> 01:35:59.786
But I don't want Ninat.

884
01:36:04.083 --> 01:36:06.042
Beyral is a good hunter.

885
01:36:07.711 --> 01:36:09.796
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

886
01:36:11.882 --> 01:36:13.633
I've already chosen.

887
01:36:17.137 --> 01:36:19.639
But this woman must also choose me.

888
01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:25.269
She already has.

889
01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.659
I am with you now, Jake.

890
01:37:23.203 --> 01:37:25.079
We are mated for life.

891
01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:33.421
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

892
01:38:03.869 --> 01:38:04.994
Ma Jake!

893
01:38:05.078 --> 01:38:06.370
Don't forget your phase integration.

894
01:38:06.455 --> 01:38:07.855
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

895
01:38:07.873 --> 01:38:09.791
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

896
01:38:18.217 --> 01:38:23.179
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

897
01:38:23.806 --> 01:38:26.307
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

898
01:38:27.476 --> 01:38:29.060
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

899
01:38:32.856 --> 01:38:33.981
Jake!

900
01:38:42.908 --> 01:38:43.991
Okay.

901
01:38:55.087 --> 01:38:57.171
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

902
01:38:57.172 --> 01:38:59.507
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

903
01:38:59.508 --> 01:39:01.592
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

904
01:39:05.722 --> 01:39:07.014
Jake!

905
01:39:13.772 --> 01:39:18.693
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

906
01:39:22.197 --> 01:39:23.531
Hey!

907
01:39:24.199 --> 01:39:26.701
Stop! Stop!

908
01:39:26.702 --> 01:39:29.537
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

909
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:35.042
Hey, boss.

910
01:39:35.544 --> 01:39:36.711
Hey!

911
01:39:39.298 --> 01:39:40.381
- What?
- I got a native

912
01:39:40.465 --> 01:39:43.426
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

913
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:46.637
Well, keep going. He'll move.

914
01:39:46.722 --> 01:39:49.974
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

915
01:39:52.311 --> 01:39:54.520
Stop! Hey!

916
01:39:54.605 --> 01:39:56.898
Go! Go!

917
01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.358
There, see? He moved.

918
01:40:11.747 --> 01:40:14.624
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

919
01:40:14.625 --> 01:40:15.625
I'm blind.

920
01:40:27.554 --> 01:40:29.805
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

921
01:40:31.391 --> 01:40:33.059
Here, come on!

922
01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.544
Freeze it right there.

923
01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:04.590
Scale up. Enhance.

924
01:41:06.218 --> 01:41:07.760
Son of a bitch.

925
01:41:09.262 --> 01:41:10.721
Unbelievable.

926
01:41:11.807 --> 01:41:13.933
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

927
01:41:20.732 --> 01:41:22.900
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

928
01:41:29.491 --> 01:41:30.783
Stop please!

929
01:41:32.285 --> 01:41:34.412
This will only make it worse.

930
01:41:34.538 --> 01:41:36.205
You do not speak here!

931
01:41:37.374 --> 01:41:39.166
We will strike them in the heart.

932
01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:49.135
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

933
01:41:52.264 --> 01:41:53.806
- You!
- Listen. Brother...

934
01:41:59.271 --> 01:42:02.440
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh, shit.

935
01:42:03.692 --> 01:42:05.693
Is this true?

936
01:42:07.195 --> 01:42:10.406
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

937
01:42:11.783 --> 01:42:12.950
Brother, please.

938
01:42:13.035 --> 01:42:16.871
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

939
01:42:16.872 --> 01:42:19.206
You are not my brother!

940
01:42:22.377 --> 01:42:24.170
And I am not your enemy!

941
01:42:25.797 --> 01:42:28.674
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

942
01:42:30.927 --> 01:42:32.720
Go! Go! Go!

943
01:42:35.932 --> 01:42:38.434
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

944
01:42:38.435 --> 01:42:39.852
Tsu'tey!

945
01:42:46.068 --> 01:42:48.986
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

946
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:52.031
And I have the right to speak.

947
01:42:56.661 --> 01:42:58.537
I have something to say...

948
01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:02.333
to all of you.

949
01:43:06.379 --> 01:43:08.464
The words are like stones in my heart.

950
01:43:12.803 --> 01:43:14.804
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

951
01:43:14.805 --> 01:43:17.098
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

952
01:43:18.266 --> 01:43:19.600
It's very dangerous!

953
01:43:22.229 --> 01:43:23.395
Grace!

954
01:43:24.606 --> 01:43:25.815
Oh, no.

955
01:43:26.024 --> 01:43:28.025
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

956
01:43:29.528 --> 01:43:31.779
Okay. Look...

957
01:43:32.864 --> 01:43:34.198
I was sent here to...

958
01:43:37.828 --> 01:43:39.245
You see?

959
01:43:39.412 --> 01:43:41.872
It is a demon in a false body.

960
01:44:01.768 --> 01:44:05.146
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.

961
01:44:08.608 --> 01:44:10.776
Wheel this meat out of here.

962
01:44:12.487 --> 01:44:15.030
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

963
01:44:18.285 --> 01:44:20.077
You let me down, son.

964
01:44:22.038 --> 01:44:23.330
So, what,

965
01:44:24.833 --> 01:44:26.876
you find yourself some local tail

966
01:44:26.877 --> 01:44:30.087
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

967
01:44:30.172 --> 01:44:32.673
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

968
01:44:32.757 --> 01:44:35.342
- Parker...
- Shut your pie hole!

969
01:44:35.343 --> 01:44:39.555
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

970
01:44:39.639 --> 01:44:42.391
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.

971
01:44:42.475 --> 01:44:45.227
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

972
01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:47.855
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

973
01:44:47.856 --> 01:44:49.899
You start by listening to her.

974
01:44:49.983 --> 01:44:52.276
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

975
01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.195
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

976
01:44:54.196 --> 01:44:56.572
You throw a stick in the air around here,

977
01:44:56.573 --> 01:44:59.575
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

978
01:44:59.659 --> 01:45:01.076
- for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking

979
01:45:01.077 --> 01:45:05.581
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

980
01:45:05.582 --> 01:45:07.750
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

981
01:45:07.751 --> 01:45:08.250
Something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

982
01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:09.835
Which is what, exactly?

983
01:45:10.879 --> 01:45:12.254
What we think we know

984
01:45:12.255 --> 01:45:15.716
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

985
01:45:15.717 --> 01:45:20.137
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

986
01:45:20.222 --> 01:45:24.808
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

987
01:45:24.893 --> 01:45:28.062
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

988
01:45:28.939 --> 01:45:31.273
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

989
01:45:31.274 --> 01:45:33.692
It's more connections
than the human brain.

990
01:45:34.861 --> 01:45:37.446
Get it? It's a network.

991
01:45:37.447 --> 01:45:40.491
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

992
01:45:40.575 --> 01:45:44.119
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

993
01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:46.872
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

994
01:45:47.457 --> 01:45:48.540
Yes!

995
01:45:49.751 --> 01:45:53.879
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

996
01:45:54.506 --> 01:45:56.590
They're just goddamn trees!

997
01:45:58.343 --> 01:46:01.136
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

998
01:46:01.137 --> 01:46:05.641
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

999
01:46:05.725 --> 01:46:09.436
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

1000
01:46:09.521 --> 01:46:13.816
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

1001
01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:18.612
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

1002
01:46:20.323 --> 01:46:22.783
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

1003
01:46:22.867 --> 01:46:25.119
They're not gonna give up their home.

1004
01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:28.580
They're not gonna make a deal.

1005
01:46:29.624 --> 01:46:31.917
For what? Lite beer?

1006
01:46:32.502 --> 01:46:34.044
And blue jeans?

1007
01:46:37.299 --> 01:46:40.175
There's nothing that we have
that they want.

1008
01:46:42.095 --> 01:46:45.139
Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time.

1009
01:46:50.061 --> 01:46:51.478
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

1010
01:46:54.357 --> 01:47:00.362
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

1011
01:47:00.572 --> 01:47:05.075
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

1012
01:47:05.118 --> 01:47:07.745
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

1013
01:47:33.438 --> 01:47:35.147
Talk to me, Lyle.

1014
01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:38.025
It looks like they hit it
with banshees first.

1015
01:47:38.151 --> 01:47:39.818
See the angle's steep?

1016
01:47:44.074 --> 01:47:46.075
They set the ampsuit on fire.

1017
01:47:46.451 --> 01:47:47.659
Driver's toast.

1018
01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:50.913
The rest of the squad?

1019
01:47:52.082 --> 01:47:55.000
Six bodies. That's all of them.

1020
01:47:56.461 --> 01:47:57.669
The equipment's totaled.

1021
01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:02.966
Jesus Christ.

1022
01:48:06.137 --> 01:48:09.515
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

1023
01:48:10.392 --> 01:48:12.893
I'll drive them out with gas first.

1024
01:48:14.145 --> 01:48:15.729
It'll be humane.

1025
01:48:17.357 --> 01:48:18.816
More or less.

1026
01:48:20.527 --> 01:48:22.361
All right, let's pull the trigger.

1027
01:48:25.824 --> 01:48:28.200
Come on, people.
Let's get it packed, let's go.

1028
01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:31.703
You know, they never even
wanted us to succeed.

1029
01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:38.085
They bulldozed a sacred site
on purpose to trigger a response.

1030
01:48:38.169 --> 01:48:40.879
Just fabricating this war
to get what they want.

1031
01:48:41.464 --> 01:48:43.340
This is how it's done.

1032
01:48:46.136 --> 01:48:49.430
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

1033
01:48:49.514 --> 01:48:53.559
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

1034
01:48:53.643 --> 01:48:56.937
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

1035
01:48:57.021 --> 01:48:58.021
My God.

1036
01:49:04.487 --> 01:49:08.740
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
- Back off!

1037
01:49:08.741 --> 01:49:12.536
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to...

1038
01:49:12.537 --> 01:49:13.704
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

1039
01:49:13.705 --> 01:49:17.207
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

1040
01:49:17.208 --> 01:49:18.917
All right? Look around!

1041
01:49:19.002 --> 01:49:22.713
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

1042
01:49:22.797 --> 01:49:24.256
- Can you guys just please...
- Yes, sir.

1043
01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:26.925
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

1044
01:49:26.926 --> 01:49:28.218
Are you gonna kill children?

1045
01:49:28.303 --> 01:49:32.222
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

1046
01:49:32.307 --> 01:49:34.725
Just let me try to talk them out.

1047
01:49:35.518 --> 01:49:37.019
They trust me.

1048
01:49:40.273 --> 01:49:42.774
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

1049
01:49:42.775 --> 01:49:44.776
Calibrating three and four.

1050
01:49:44.777 --> 01:49:47.738
- Run sequence.
- Initiating. Thirty seconds.

1051
01:49:52.118 --> 01:49:53.911
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

1052
01:49:53.912 --> 01:49:56.580
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

1053
01:49:56.581 --> 01:49:59.249
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

1054
01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:06.423
Father!

1055
01:50:06.591 --> 01:50:07.633
Mother!

1056
01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:10.886
Eytukan, I have something to say.

1057
01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:12.387
Listen!

1058
01:50:13.431 --> 01:50:14.890
Speak, Jakesully.

1059
01:50:16.267 --> 01:50:19.228
A great evil is upon us...

1060
01:50:19.562 --> 01:50:21.438
The Sky People are coming...

1061
01:50:21.689 --> 01:50:24.191
to destroy Hometree.

1062
01:50:26.653 --> 01:50:28.333
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

1063
01:50:30.657 --> 01:50:33.492
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

1064
01:50:33.493 --> 01:50:35.452
Are you certain of this?

1065
01:50:39.249 --> 01:50:42.960
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

1066
01:50:44.128 --> 01:50:47.422
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

1067
01:50:49.968 --> 01:50:53.595
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

1068
01:50:56.808 --> 01:50:58.350
Yes.

1069
01:50:58.351 --> 01:51:00.811
Look, at first it was just orders,

1070
01:51:02.313 --> 01:51:04.690
and then everything changed.

1071
01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:06.483
Okay? I fell in love.

1072
01:51:07.151 --> 01:51:12.447
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

1073
01:51:13.616 --> 01:51:15.075
And with you.

1074
01:51:16.035 --> 01:51:17.869
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

1075
01:51:17.954 --> 01:51:20.831
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now, please.

1076
01:51:28.172 --> 01:51:30.674
You will never be one of The People!

1077
01:51:30.675 --> 01:51:32.551
- I shouldn't have...
- We tried to stop them!

1078
01:51:32.552 --> 01:51:34.595
Neytiri, please! Please.

1079
01:51:39.517 --> 01:51:40.684
Bind them.

1080
01:51:42.312 --> 01:51:43.437
Leave now!

1081
01:51:43.605 --> 01:51:46.940
You have to go. They're coming!

1082
01:52:00.788 --> 01:52:03.040
Time on target, one mike.

1083
01:52:03.041 --> 01:52:05.083
Copy. We have a visual.

1084
01:52:05.084 --> 01:52:08.128
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

1085
01:52:08.212 --> 01:52:09.546
Roger, 030.

1086
01:52:23.353 --> 01:52:25.395
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

1087
01:52:27.023 --> 01:52:30.859
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri, you must go now!

1088
01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:36.907
Run to the forest! Run!

1089
01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:40.619
Run! Run!

1090
01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:44.289
Have no fear.

1091
01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:04.893
No! God damn it, run!

1092
01:53:05.103 --> 01:53:08.230
Take the ikran...
attack from above.

1093
01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:14.695
That is one big damn tree.

1094
01:53:22.203 --> 01:53:26.415
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1095
01:53:28.376 --> 01:53:30.460
All right, people, let's get this done!

1096
01:53:30.545 --> 01:53:33.463
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

1097
01:53:33.464 --> 01:53:35.507
Roger. CS.40's going hot.

1098
01:53:35.883 --> 01:53:37.092
- Fire.
- Firing.

1099
01:53:48.521 --> 01:53:50.564
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

1100
01:53:58.489 --> 01:54:00.157
Sir, they've opened fire.

1101
01:54:02.034 --> 01:54:03.785
You've got to be kidding me!

1102
01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:18.842
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

1103
01:54:18.926 --> 01:54:20.677
All right, let's turn up the heat.

1104
01:54:20.678 --> 01:54:23.680
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.

1105
01:54:23.681 --> 01:54:24.806
Fire.

1106
01:54:28.102 --> 01:54:29.186
No!

1107
01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:44.159
Get everyone to the forest.

1108
01:54:47.538 --> 01:54:49.748
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

1109
01:54:53.503 --> 01:54:54.711
Neytiri!

1110
01:55:03.387 --> 01:55:06.431
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

1111
01:55:06.516 --> 01:55:07.808
My God!

1112
01:55:26.369 --> 01:55:29.746
- Mo'at! No!
- Lf you are one of us,

1113
01:55:31.249 --> 01:55:32.582
help us.

1114
01:55:40.341 --> 01:55:42.342
All call signs, switch missiles.

1115
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:44.928
Give me HE's
at the base of the west columns.

1116
01:55:46.889 --> 01:55:48.139
This way!

1117
01:55:49.267 --> 01:55:51.142
Rider section, switch missiles.

1118
01:55:51.227 --> 01:55:53.186
- One's good.
- Two's rocks up.

1119
01:55:53.271 --> 01:55:55.814
- Three's up.
- Yeah, baby, get some!

1120
01:55:56.357 --> 01:55:58.608
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

1121
01:55:58.693 --> 01:56:00.110
- Bring it down.
- Cleared hot.

1122
01:56:07.159 --> 01:56:08.743
Come on, Grace, move!

1123
01:56:11.372 --> 01:56:12.956
Down! Head down!

1124
01:56:15.543 --> 01:56:17.794
Come on, come on! Down!

1125
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:24.551
- Solid hits.
- Solid rocks on target.

1126
01:56:24.635 --> 01:56:25.802
Screw this.

1127
01:56:27.054 --> 01:56:29.055
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1128
01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:30.932
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1129
01:56:40.610 --> 01:56:42.485
Repeat. Ripple fire.

1130
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:27.572
Go! Go! Go!

1131
01:58:00.690 --> 01:58:03.149
No, no, get back! Back!

1132
01:58:22.169 --> 01:58:24.754
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1133
01:59:09.759 --> 01:59:13.386
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1134
01:59:14.055 --> 01:59:15.305
Let's boogie.

1135
01:59:15.723 --> 01:59:18.141
Dragon coming left, heading home.

1136
01:59:18.601 --> 01:59:20.518
Gunrunner coming left.

1137
01:59:20.603 --> 01:59:23.146
- Thunder copies.
- Rider section copies.

1138
01:59:30.738 --> 01:59:31.821
Father!

1139
01:59:47.671 --> 01:59:49.005
Daughter...

1140
01:59:50.174 --> 01:59:53.259
take... my... bow.

1141
01:59:57.389 --> 02:00:01.851
Protect The People.

1142
02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:11.486
Neytiri!

1143
02:00:21.539 --> 02:00:25.250
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get away.

1144
02:00:25.918 --> 02:00:27.210
Get away!

1145
02:00:28.295 --> 02:00:30.046
Get away from here!

1146
02:00:31.507 --> 02:00:33.091
Never come back!

1147
02:00:50.776 --> 02:00:51.901
Pull the plug.

1148
02:00:52.903 --> 02:00:55.572
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

1149
02:00:55.573 --> 02:00:57.574
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

1150
02:01:13.757 --> 02:01:16.301
I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace.

1151
02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:21.598
Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.

1152
02:01:24.435 --> 02:01:25.894
Let's go!

1153
02:01:33.736 --> 02:01:35.320
Put him down!

1154
02:01:38.699 --> 02:01:41.451
You murderer!

1155
02:02:28.082 --> 02:02:30.166
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1156
02:02:30.251 --> 02:02:31.334
Hey.

1157
02:02:32.670 --> 02:02:35.380
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1158
02:02:35.464 --> 02:02:38.841
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

1159
02:02:39.843 --> 02:02:42.387
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1160
02:02:42.471 --> 02:02:45.014
- Trudy!
- All the way down.

1161
02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:49.644
Max!

1162
02:02:59.697 --> 02:03:02.198
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1163
02:03:02.783 --> 02:03:03.866
Here.

1164
02:03:15.963 --> 02:03:18.423
- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.

1165
02:03:33.981 --> 02:03:37.942
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1166
02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:39.235
Okay. Go.

1167
02:03:53.042 --> 02:03:54.208
Clear.

1168
02:03:56.170 --> 02:03:57.462
Come on, baby.

1169
02:03:57.463 --> 02:04:00.256
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1170
02:04:03.886 --> 02:04:06.929
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1171
02:04:09.975 --> 02:04:11.267
Three!

1172
02:04:14.104 --> 02:04:15.313
Come on!

1173
02:04:17.274 --> 02:04:18.608
Mask on!

1174
02:04:21.195 --> 02:04:23.029
Gas, gas, gas!

1175
02:04:24.656 --> 02:04:26.699
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1176
02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:32.288
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1177
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:35.124
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1178
02:04:47.763 --> 02:04:49.097
Colonel!

1179
02:04:55.813 --> 02:04:59.357
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

1180
02:05:02.569 --> 02:05:05.238
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?

1181
02:05:05.322 --> 02:05:06.864
Oh, yeah, baby!

1182
02:05:06.865 --> 02:05:08.783
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

1183
02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:11.994
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1184
02:05:12.246 --> 02:05:14.038
- Grace is hit!
- What?

1185
02:05:15.165 --> 02:05:16.833
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

1186
02:05:16.834 --> 02:05:20.336
- Keep the pressure on, Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1187
02:05:20.421 --> 02:05:24.924
- Hang on, Grace.
- Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1188
02:05:28.262 --> 02:05:30.721
- You're good to go.
- Take it up!

1189
02:05:31.890 --> 02:05:33.724
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1190
02:05:38.147 --> 02:05:39.605
You're clear!

1191
02:05:47.531 --> 02:05:50.283
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1192
02:05:50.367 --> 02:05:51.784
Copy that.

1193
02:05:58.750 --> 02:06:02.044
- Norm, you all good up there?
- Yep! Still here.

1194
02:06:03.922 --> 02:06:08.593
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

1195
02:06:08.677 --> 02:06:10.720
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1196
02:06:10.804 --> 02:06:12.305
Yeah.

1197
02:06:12.389 --> 02:06:14.348
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1198
02:06:23.192 --> 02:06:24.358
Ouch.

1199
02:06:27.738 --> 02:06:29.197
You big baby.

1200
02:06:30.532 --> 02:06:31.991
We're moving.

1201
02:06:32.534 --> 02:06:34.577
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1202
02:06:35.537 --> 02:06:37.705
I'm a scientist, remember?

1203
02:06:38.624 --> 02:06:41.083
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1204
02:06:41.919 --> 02:06:43.836
The People can help you.

1205
02:06:44.296 --> 02:06:45.588
I know it.

1206
02:06:47.591 --> 02:06:49.467
Why would they help us?

1207
02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:08.611
The People say Eywa will provide.

1208
02:07:10.531 --> 02:07:13.241
With no home, no hope,

1209
02:07:14.284 --> 02:07:16.452
there was only one place they could go.

1210
02:07:30.884 --> 02:07:32.093
Link's running.

1211
02:07:32.803 --> 02:07:35.805
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.

1212
02:07:36.848 --> 02:07:41.519
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1213
02:07:42.479 --> 02:07:43.896
I gotta try.

1214
02:07:46.650 --> 02:07:47.984
Launching.

1215
02:08:09.464 --> 02:08:10.673
Outcast.

1216
02:08:11.466 --> 02:08:12.717
Betrayer.

1217
02:08:13.802 --> 02:08:14.969
Alien.

1218
02:08:16.513 --> 02:08:19.223
I was in the place the eye does not see.

1219
02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:34.280
I needed their help, and they needed mine.

1220
02:08:35.198 --> 02:08:37.241
But to ever face them again,

1221
02:08:37.242 --> 02:08:39.744
I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.

1222
02:08:48.295 --> 02:08:51.631
Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move.

1223
02:08:54.384 --> 02:08:56.761
There's something we gotta do.

1224
02:08:56.845 --> 02:08:58.554
You're not gonna like it.

1225
02:09:08.565 --> 02:09:12.443
The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1226
02:09:12.444 --> 02:09:14.111
Nothing attacks him.

1227
02:09:14.613 --> 02:09:15.946
Easy, boy.

1228
02:09:16.406 --> 02:09:18.240
So why would he ever look up?

1229
02:09:19.368 --> 02:09:20.993
But that was just a theory.

1230
02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:33.315
Toruk Macto?

1231
02:11:13.106 --> 02:11:14.607
I See you.

1232
02:11:17.694 --> 02:11:19.028
I See you.

1233
02:11:27.329 --> 02:11:29.038
I was afraid, Jake.

1234
02:11:30.457 --> 02:11:31.957
For my people.

1235
02:11:35.003 --> 02:11:36.629
I'm not anymore.

1236
02:11:46.056 --> 02:11:48.390
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1237
02:11:49.017 --> 02:11:51.060
I stand before you...

1238
02:11:52.062 --> 02:11:55.231
ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1239
02:11:57.818 --> 02:12:02.071
You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior.

1240
02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:05.407
I can't do this without you.

1241
02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:13.874
Toruk Macto,

1242
02:12:21.716 --> 02:12:23.467
I will fly with you.

1243
02:12:26.763 --> 02:12:28.514
My friend is dying.

1244
02:12:30.892 --> 02:12:32.434
Grace is dying.

1245
02:12:34.437 --> 02:12:36.272
I beg the help of Eywa.

1246
02:12:48.201 --> 02:12:50.202
Look where we are, Grace.

1247
02:12:56.918 --> 02:12:59.295
I need to take some samples.

1248
02:13:22.736 --> 02:13:26.822
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1249
02:13:28.033 --> 02:13:29.491
in this body.

1250
02:13:32.037 --> 02:13:33.704
Is that possible?

1251
02:13:33.788 --> 02:13:38.292
She must pass through the eye of Eywa
and return.

1252
02:13:39.544 --> 02:13:41.086
But, Jakesully,

1253
02:13:42.088 --> 02:13:43.714
she is very weak.

1254
02:13:45.175 --> 02:13:48.010
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1255
02:13:51.181 --> 02:13:53.807
Hear us please, All Mother.

1256
02:13:54.351 --> 02:13:56.685
Eywa, help her.

1257
02:13:57.354 --> 02:13:59.563
Take this spirit into you...

1258
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:05.361
and breathe her back to us.

1259
02:14:09.157 --> 02:14:10.824
Let her walk among us...

1260
02:14:13.328 --> 02:14:15.287
as one of The People.

1261
02:14:44.234 --> 02:14:45.317
Jake.

1262
02:14:47.737 --> 02:14:48.904
Grace.

1263
02:14:51.032 --> 02:14:52.741
I'm with her, Jake.

1264
02:14:54.744 --> 02:14:56.120
She's real!

1265
02:14:59.165 --> 02:15:02.334
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1266
02:15:03.503 --> 02:15:05.129
What's happening?

1267
02:15:06.089 --> 02:15:07.756
What's happening?

1268
02:15:12.095 --> 02:15:13.262
Grace!

1269
02:15:13.972 --> 02:15:15.139
Grace!

1270
02:15:17.225 --> 02:15:18.851
What's happening?

1271
02:15:25.108 --> 02:15:26.525
Did it work?

1272
02:15:32.198 --> 02:15:36.285
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1273
02:15:37.954 --> 02:15:39.705
She is with Eywa now.

1274
02:16:13.490 --> 02:16:16.158
With your permission, I will speak now.

1275
02:16:18.536 --> 02:16:20.996
You would honor me by translating.

1276
02:16:28.088 --> 02:16:30.297
The Sky People have sent us a message

1277
02:16:33.676 --> 02:16:36.095
that they can take whatever they want

1278
02:16:37.889 --> 02:16:39.681
and no one can stop them.

1279
02:16:43.269 --> 02:16:45.062
Well, we will send them a message.

1280
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:50.025
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

1281
02:16:53.321 --> 02:16:55.697
You tell the other clans to come.

1282
02:16:58.827 --> 02:17:01.328
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

1283
02:17:03.540 --> 02:17:06.333
And you fly now with me!

1284
02:17:07.377 --> 02:17:09.878
My brothers! Sisters!

1285
02:17:10.964 --> 02:17:13.048
And we will show the Sky People

1286
02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:15.926
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1287
02:17:17.428 --> 02:17:18.887
and that this,

1288
02:17:19.597 --> 02:17:20.639
this is our land!

1289
02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:29.189
Yah!

1290
02:17:44.289 --> 02:17:45.706
Yah!

1291
02:18:15.111 --> 02:18:16.486
Yah!

1292
02:18:34.005 --> 02:18:35.505
We rode out to the four winds.

1293
02:18:38.259 --> 02:18:40.677
To the horse clans of the plain.

1294
02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:44.681
Back to the stars!

1295
02:18:44.766 --> 02:18:47.017
To the ikran people ofthe Eastern Sea.

1296
02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:48.310
For our children's children!

1297
02:18:48.394 --> 02:18:50.979
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

1298
02:18:54.817 --> 02:18:56.193
Yah!

1299
02:19:32.355 --> 02:19:34.856
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1300
02:19:34.941 --> 02:19:36.775
is fighting for survival.

1301
02:19:36.859 --> 02:19:38.360
That's a fact!

1302
02:19:39.195 --> 02:19:42.948
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

1303
02:19:44.033 --> 02:19:47.911
Now, these orbital images tell me

1304
02:19:48.329 --> 02:19:51.581
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1305
02:19:51.582 --> 02:19:54.167
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1306
02:19:54.711 --> 02:19:56.712
And more are pouring in.

1307
02:19:59.173 --> 02:20:02.592
In a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1308
02:20:02.677 --> 02:20:05.053
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

1309
02:20:05.054 --> 02:20:07.306
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1310
02:20:08.891 --> 02:20:12.561
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1311
02:20:12.562 --> 02:20:14.980
We will fight terror with terror.

1312
02:20:19.277 --> 02:20:23.447
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1313
02:20:23.531 --> 02:20:27.367
is protected by their...
Their deity.

1314
02:20:28.661 --> 02:20:30.787
And when we destroy it,

1315
02:20:30.788 --> 02:20:33.165
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1316
02:20:33.249 --> 02:20:36.752
that they won't come within 1,000
klicks of this place ever again.

1317
02:20:36.836 --> 02:20:39.546
And that, too, is a fact.

1318
02:20:40.256 --> 02:20:42.007
Yeah! Yeah.

1319
02:20:52.477 --> 02:20:54.446
Jake, it's crazy here.
It's full mobilization.

1320
02:20:54.459 --> 02:20:56.438
They're rigging the
shuttle as a bomber.

1321
02:20:56.522 --> 02:20:58.774
They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives.

1322
02:20:58.858 --> 02:21:01.777
It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign.

1323
02:21:01.861 --> 02:21:03.779
Fricking daisy cutters!

1324
02:21:05.281 --> 02:21:08.116
Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

1325
02:21:08.201 --> 02:21:10.285
- When?
- 0600 tomorrow.

1326
02:21:10.370 --> 02:21:12.245
- Max! Max!
- I gotta go.

1327
02:21:14.123 --> 02:21:15.624
We're screwed!

1328
02:21:17.085 --> 02:21:19.336
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

1329
02:21:19.337 --> 02:21:21.588
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1330
02:21:23.049 --> 02:21:26.426
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1331
02:21:29.430 --> 02:21:31.473
I have 15 clans out there.

1332
02:21:32.141 --> 02:21:34.267
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1333
02:21:35.770 --> 02:21:40.232
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1334
02:21:41.275 --> 02:21:45.320
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

1335
02:21:45.822 --> 02:21:47.322
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1336
02:21:47.407 --> 02:21:51.660
If they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

1337
02:21:53.538 --> 02:21:56.998
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1338
02:21:57.083 --> 02:21:58.333
Yeah, I know.

1339
02:21:58.334 --> 02:22:00.877
If they get to the Tree
of Souls, it's over.

1340
02:22:00.962 --> 02:22:04.172
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1341
02:22:04.966 --> 02:22:07.008
It'll destroy them.

1342
02:22:07.009 --> 02:22:09.469
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1343
02:22:24.527 --> 02:22:27.529
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1344
02:22:29.949 --> 02:22:34.703
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

1345
02:22:37.248 --> 02:22:41.668
If Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

1346
02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:45.046
See the world we come from.

1347
02:22:46.132 --> 02:22:48.049
There's no green there.

1348
02:22:49.427 --> 02:22:51.428
They killed their Mother.

1349
02:22:52.221 --> 02:22:54.723
And they're gonna do the same here.

1350
02:22:56.350 --> 02:22:58.935
More Sky People are gonna come.

1351
02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:02.063
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1352
02:23:03.357 --> 02:23:05.108
Unless we stop them.

1353
02:23:07.695 --> 02:23:10.780
Look, you chose me for something.

1354
02:23:12.241 --> 02:23:14.117
I will stand and fight.

1355
02:23:15.161 --> 02:23:16.745
You know I will.

1356
02:23:19.248 --> 02:23:21.500
But I need a little help here.

1357
02:23:27.632 --> 02:23:30.675
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1358
02:23:32.470 --> 02:23:35.931
She protects only the balance of life.

1359
02:23:47.735 --> 02:23:49.444
It was worth a try.

1360
02:24:20.142 --> 02:24:22.185
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1361
02:24:22.186 --> 02:24:25.564
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1362
02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:41.037
This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.

1363
02:24:41.414 --> 02:24:45.000
- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode.

1364
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:21.786
This is Papa Dragon.

1365
02:25:21.871 --> 02:25:24.956
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1366
02:25:32.465 --> 02:25:36.217
- Suit Team, go.
- All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1367
02:25:46.771 --> 02:25:48.396
Move, move, move!

1368
02:25:54.028 --> 02:25:55.820
Bravo 1-1, move left.

1369
02:25:56.364 --> 02:25:59.783
Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.

1370
02:26:02.119 --> 02:26:05.747
- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that.

1371
02:26:05.748 --> 02:26:08.166
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

1372
02:26:08.250 --> 02:26:09.626
Copy that. Over.

1373
02:26:09.627 --> 02:26:14.339
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

1374
02:26:14.924 --> 02:26:18.301
All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target.

1375
02:26:18.302 --> 02:26:20.762
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

1376
02:26:25.851 --> 02:26:28.395
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1377
02:26:29.355 --> 02:26:31.981
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

1378
02:26:32.108 --> 02:26:35.026
Make no mistake, people,
they're out there.

1379
02:26:36.612 --> 02:26:39.864
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

1380
02:26:39.949 --> 02:26:42.158
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1381
02:26:42.284 --> 02:26:44.786
- Copy. Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1382
02:26:45.579 --> 02:26:47.789
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1383
02:26:50.042 --> 02:26:51.126
Hold!

1384
02:26:59.135 --> 02:27:01.177
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.

1385
02:27:01.262 --> 02:27:02.679
- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up.

1386
02:27:02.763 --> 02:27:06.933
- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1, hold position.

1387
02:27:13.023 --> 02:27:16.025
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

1388
02:27:16.026 --> 02:27:18.611
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
- Firing line!

1389
02:27:18.988 --> 02:27:21.698
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

1390
02:27:22.408 --> 02:27:25.160
- Can't you clean it up?
- No, sir. It's the Flux.

1391
02:27:53.439 --> 02:27:56.107
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1392
02:28:37.858 --> 02:28:40.610
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1393
02:28:41.737 --> 02:28:42.946
Break right. Come around.

1394
02:28:46.492 --> 02:28:47.992
Light them up!

1395
02:28:55.626 --> 02:28:57.836
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1396
02:29:05.094 --> 02:29:06.970
Yeah! Get some!

1397
02:29:45.968 --> 02:29:47.802
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1398
02:29:58.647 --> 02:30:00.440
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1399
02:30:01.108 --> 02:30:03.818
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1400
02:30:03.819 --> 02:30:04.819
Copy. Get out of there.

1401
02:30:09.992 --> 02:30:11.409
That's him. Get after him!

1402
02:30:28.344 --> 02:30:29.844
Take him out!

1403
02:30:38.145 --> 02:30:39.604
Light her up!

1404
02:30:48.614 --> 02:30:50.031
Right there!

1405
02:30:50.157 --> 02:30:52.408
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1406
02:30:52.660 --> 02:30:54.369
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

1407
02:30:54.370 --> 02:30:55.453
Arming all pods.

1408
02:31:01.168 --> 02:31:02.251
That's it!

1409
02:31:32.908 --> 02:31:34.033
Seyzey!

1410
02:32:37.973 --> 02:32:40.141
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

1411
02:32:41.101 --> 02:32:42.518
Sorry, Jake.

1412
02:32:59.536 --> 02:33:00.620
Fire.

1413
02:33:18.722 --> 02:33:21.224
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1414
02:33:24.061 --> 02:33:25.728
Rogue One, you copy?

1415
02:33:27.731 --> 02:33:28.898
Trudy!

1416
02:33:39.785 --> 02:33:41.077
Time to target, two minutes.

1417
02:33:41.411 --> 02:33:43.830
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1418
02:33:43.914 --> 02:33:46.082
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1419
02:33:51.922 --> 02:33:55.758
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!

1420
02:33:57.135 --> 02:33:58.386
Ma Jake!

1421
02:34:00.305 --> 02:34:01.472
I read you.

1422
02:34:10.607 --> 02:34:12.608
- Neytiri!
- Seyzey's dead.

1423
02:34:13.193 --> 02:34:15.695
They are very close. They are many.

1424
02:34:17.114 --> 02:34:18.614
Do not attack.

1425
02:34:19.199 --> 02:34:21.158
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1426
02:34:23.745 --> 02:34:25.037
Do not attack!

1427
02:34:25.372 --> 02:34:28.541
Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!

1428
02:34:36.633 --> 02:34:37.842
Neytiri!

1429
02:34:39.928 --> 02:34:41.846
I got movement, I got movement.

1430
02:34:41.930 --> 02:34:44.181
Hold position. Something's coming.

1431
02:34:44.266 --> 02:34:46.058
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over.

1432
02:34:46.143 --> 02:34:48.352
- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation.

1433
02:34:48.353 --> 02:34:50.104
- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks.

1434
02:34:55.235 --> 02:34:56.736
Hundred meters and closing fast.

1435
02:35:13.295 --> 02:35:14.879
We gotta get out of here!

1436
02:35:22.679 --> 02:35:24.388
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Move! Move! Move!

1437
02:35:24.473 --> 02:35:26.891
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

1438
02:35:34.024 --> 02:35:36.692
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1439
02:35:43.617 --> 02:35:45.409
Eywa has heard you!

1440
02:35:55.963 --> 02:35:57.380
Come on!

1441
02:36:09.643 --> 02:36:11.519
Fall back! Move! Move!

1442
02:36:36.003 --> 02:36:38.713
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1443
02:36:38.714 --> 02:36:42.842
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1444
02:36:42.926 --> 02:36:45.845
- Press to target.
- Copy. Pressing to target.

1445
02:36:45.846 --> 02:36:47.888
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1446
02:37:07.701 --> 02:37:10.202
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1447
02:37:10.203 --> 02:37:12.538
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1448
02:37:12.539 --> 02:37:13.860
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1449
02:37:46.698 --> 02:37:47.865
Brace!

1450
02:38:04.883 --> 02:38:06.258
It's Sully.

1451
02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:22.233
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

1452
02:41:06.606 --> 02:41:08.482
Come on. Come to papa.

1453
02:41:35.927 --> 02:41:37.720
Give it up, Quaritch!

1454
02:41:40.765 --> 02:41:42.266
It's all over.

1455
02:41:43.518 --> 02:41:46.061
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1456
02:41:46.062 --> 02:41:48.355
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1457
02:42:44.496 --> 02:42:45.746
Come on!

1458
02:43:01.596 --> 02:43:05.724
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1459
02:43:10.355 --> 02:43:12.564
You think you're one of them?

1460
02:43:13.775 --> 02:43:15.442
Time to wake up.

1461
02:44:59.631 --> 02:45:00.714
Jake?

1462
02:45:14.395 --> 02:45:15.520
Jake.

1463
02:45:33.498 --> 02:45:34.915
Jake.

1464
02:45:50.932 --> 02:45:52.933
Jake! Ma Jake!

1465
02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:35.934
I See you.

1466
02:46:41.524 --> 02:46:42.858
I See you.

1467
02:47:07.967 --> 02:47:09.176
I See you, Brother.

1468
02:47:10.386 --> 02:47:11.595
Are The People safe?

1469
02:47:14.432 --> 02:47:15.557
They're safe.

1470
02:47:22.065 --> 02:47:23.565
I can't...

1471
02:47:24.734 --> 02:47:26.985
I cannot lead The People.

1472
02:47:27.528 --> 02:47:29.863
You must lead them... Jakesully.

1473
02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:33.158
I'm not officer material.

1474
02:47:33.242 --> 02:47:34.993
It is decided.

1475
02:47:38.331 --> 02:47:39.539
Now...

1476
02:47:40.750 --> 02:47:43.168
do the duty of Olo'eyktan.

1477
02:47:47.757 --> 02:47:49.424
I will not kill you.

1478
02:47:49.467 --> 02:47:51.093
It is the way!

1479
02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:55.013
And it is good.

1480
02:47:57.266 --> 02:47:59.101
I will be remembered.

1481
02:48:01.729 --> 02:48:05.774
I fought... with Toruk Macto!

1482
02:48:08.277 --> 02:48:10.153
And we were brothers.

1483
02:48:11.572 --> 02:48:15.659
And he... was my last shadow.

1484
02:49:02.081 --> 02:49:04.916
The aliens went back to their dying world.

1485
02:49:07.086 --> 02:49:10.005
Only a few were chosen to stay.

1486
02:49:22.226 --> 02:49:24.769
The time of great sorrow was ending.

1487
02:49:26.814 --> 02:49:29.232
Toruk Macto was no longerneeded.

1488
02:49:41.787 --> 02:49:45.665
Well, I guess this is my last video log.

1489
02:49:47.501 --> 02:49:51.338
'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm...

1490
02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:55.175
I'm not gonna be coming back
to this place.

1491
02:49:58.804 --> 02:50:00.931
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1492
02:50:03.517 --> 02:50:06.561
Yeah, I don't want to be late
for my own party.

1493
02:50:09.899 --> 02:50:12.359
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1494
02:50:14.862 --> 02:50:17.197
This is Jake Sully signing off.
