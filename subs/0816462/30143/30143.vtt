1
00:03:09,252 --> 00:03:11,903
Judd, you can't.

2
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:13,794
I got to
get in the house.

3
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,154
Poke your head out in the
clear, and a Falin will get you.

4
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:22,237
But Melissa,
she's going to have a baby.

5
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,047
Hit you, David?

6
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:43,937
No Falin can ever
get me, Uncle Judd.

7
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:14,589
Oh, God, give her the
strength to be good,

8
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,358
to be never hateful
and never fight.

9
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:24,480
And don't let her
carry the burden of fear,

10
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:29,277
watching her loved ones
and seeing them die.

11
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:34,205
Always asking
out of her heart,

12
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:40,385
" Why has it got to be?
Why has it got to be?"

13
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:09,562
<i>When it's twilight
on the trail</i>

14
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:13,725
<i>And I jog along</i>

15
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:16,381
<i>The world is like a dream</i>

16
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:21,698
<i>And the ripple of the stream
is my song</i>

17
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:26,811
<i>When it's twilight
on the trail</i>

18
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:31,103
<i>And I rest once more</i>

19
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:33,560
<i>My ceiling is the sky</i>

20
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:38,589
<i>And the grass on which I lie
is my floor</i>

21
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,735
<i>Never ever have a nickel in my jeans</i>

22
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,311
<i>Never ever
have a debt to pay</i>

23
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:55,933
<i>Still I understand
what real contentment means</i>

24
00:05:56,867 --> 00:06:00,795
<i>Guess I was born that way</i>

25
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:07,682
<i>When it's twilight
on the trail</i>

26
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:12,449
<i>And my voice is still</i>

27
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:15,810
<i>Please plant
this heart of mine</i>

28
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:21,855
<i>Underneath the Lonesome Pine on the hill</i>

29
00:06:22,723 --> 00:06:24,545
And I says to him, I says,
"Look here, Zeke Denker,

30
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:26,978
" you're driving your hogs
to mighty poor swill. "

31
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,669
Bet that buttoned him.
Not Zeke.

32
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:31,456
He's the laughingest man I
ever met. Nothing bites him.

33
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,083
Laughs when it's clever enough to rain.

34
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:34,780
Laughs when
the sun shines.

35
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:37,502
He looks me
right in the eye...

36
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:39,484
Dave's better.

37
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:41,180
Is he?
Yep.

38
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:45,186
Perking up a mite.
Arm's a little green

39
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:47,291
but I stuck a chaw
of tobaccy on it.

40
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,535
Cold rifle barreI
will do it more good.

41
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:52,123
What he have to say?
About the Falins I mean.

42
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:55,643
" Eat your sow belly and get
for home. " That's what he said.

43
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,082
Said, " Ain't gonna be no
fighting till I can tote a gun. "

44
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:59,227
And I come six miles.

45
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,347
Six miles.

46
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,623
I can throw a clump
of dogwood that far.

47
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm nigh on to 30 miles.
Look. Look.

48
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,666
Gather around now.
Gather around.

49
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,649
I'm really going to
show you something now.

50
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:13,210
Maybe we's will
get a go at the kid.

51
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:17,178
Whenever Judd Tolliver gets
an itch to plug the Falins,

52
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,739
he starts playing
with the young ones.

53
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,393
I'm gonna be
the human hub.

54
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:27,583
Now, Willie, you go down there and
stop me if I get to going too fast.

55
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:33,562
Lizzie Bee, you better
go down and help Willie.

56
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:38,200
Look out now, here I come.
Don't forget to stop me.

57
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,142
Well, why didn't
you stop me?

58
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:01,242
Judd's better than that
wagon show we saw once.

59
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,103
Melissa, you got a
bellyache or something?

60
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:14,494
Just thinking, Lina.

61
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,189
Sakes and sassafras!

62
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,982
Thinking
boils the pot over.

63
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:21,434
It boils over and over and
over if you ain't thinking.

64
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:26,396
Killing.
All the time killing.

65
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,922
They are planning it now.
They done it yesterday,

66
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:31,362
and the week before,
and the year before that.

67
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,242
Ever since I was a
little child they done it.

68
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:36,129
Kill a Falin.
Kill a Falin.

69
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,788
That's all they could say.

70
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:40,761
Plowing, splitting reins.
Filling the corn crib.

71
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:44,992
Kill a Falin! And the echo comes
back to us from over the hills.

72
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,314
Kill a Tolliver.
Kill. Kill. Why?

73
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,524
Melissa!

74
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:58,776
What you biting
your paws about, Auntie?

75
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,501
Worrying, I guess, June
and Buddie ain't back yet.

76
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:02,946
Where they be?

77
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:06,077
Over at the yard doctor,
getting a potion for you.

78
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:12,925
Is that the way
you like it?

79
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:17,175
Just right.

80
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:20,000
You should have let me
get a town doctor, Dave.

81
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:23,165
It don't look right.
It's too swole up.

82
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:24,479
You're awfully
good to me, Auntie.

83
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,041
You're a good boy, Dave.

84
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:27,457
Your boy.

85
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:28,832
My boy.

86
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:30,907
Sometimes I wished I was,
Auntie. Then I wished I wasn't

87
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:34,395
'cause if I was, I couldn't
marry June and if I wasn't...

88
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:37,787
Relations like we ones
got me all thicked up.

89
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:40,280
Cousins are always thicker than
fleas in the mountains, Dave.

90
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,379
I'm a big, big
black bear.

91
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,610
I'm a mean black bear.

92
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:57,342
I'm getting closer.
I'll get you.

93
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,939
I'm coming closer.

94
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:23,938
You laugh at me, foreigner,
and I'll... I'll...

95
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,560
I don't blame you, I'd
do the same thing myself.

96
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,704
That was funny.
Why didn't you laugh?

97
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:40,957
She's one of
the Tollivers.

98
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:42,139
That's still funny.

99
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:43,226
She didn't think so.

100
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,924
That's a woman's privilege.

101
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,075
Now, where were we?

102
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,424
Right in the middle of
that fault, over there.

103
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:48,538
Yeah.

104
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:51,480
Two years supply of strip-coaI
before we have to drift mine it.

105
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:52,668
We'll steam-shovel
the top coal

106
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,877
and make it pay for
the railroad up here.

107
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,191
You haven't got it yet.

108
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,274
No.

109
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:58,754
Well, suppose you let
me worry about that.

110
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:02,299
The right and title to that
privilege is yours, my friend.

111
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,149
You got that privilege
this very minute.

112
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:06,844
Start using it.

113
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:12,674
I was just
running in that wood,

114
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,365
and I heard
she was a bear.

115
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:16,409
And when I looked
around to see if she

116
00:11:16,547 --> 00:11:18,008
was going to eat me,
she was gone.

117
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,352
Maybe she ate herself
and disappeared.

118
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,361
Judd Tolliver,
how you talk.

119
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,793
Child. Child. You mustn't.

120
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,485
Juny's coming back.

121
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,976
Maybe she stopped
down by the river.

122
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,510
Looks like she fetched
the river with her.

123
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:41,757
June!

124
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,136
Well, I brung it,
didn't I?

125
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,992
June, if you ain't
the lookingest...

126
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,269
I've been running
across that log

127
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,379
ever since I was knee
high to a grasshopper.

128
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,361
I can catch a squirreI
on it with one hand,

129
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:51,841
but when that dog
see that foreigner...

130
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,216
Foreigner?

131
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:56,224
He stopped right smack-dab in the
middle of the log and I tripped.

132
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,666
What was
the foreigner doing?

133
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,771
Don't know.
Wasn't looking.

134
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:02,177
Before you know it, there
I go. Plunk, right down.

135
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,421
What did he look like?

136
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:04,603
Just had a squint.

137
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:09,017
He's about so tall,
about that wide.

138
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:11,294
Was all dressed in brown,
even his hat.

139
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,737
And his coat had a belt.

140
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:14,047
Just a squint?

141
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:15,840
Dave Tolliver,
if you're thinking

142
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:17,216
what I'm a thinking, I'm
going to tell you off.

143
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:19,868
Go down to the creek
and wash your dirty face.

144
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,914
For two carrot seeds,
I'd rub it all over you.

145
00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:24,125
You do it, and I'll
spank you where it hurts.

146
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:25,951
You will, will you?

147
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,615
Did that hurt?

148
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:33,633
How could it?

149
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,515
Oh!

150
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,489
I've been talking
to your pappy.

151
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:41,984
We's going to get married.

152
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,052
When?
Hog killing time.

153
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:46,464
Your pappy has invited
all the Tollivers.

154
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,702
The whole kit
and boodle of them.

155
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:50,462
I ain't marrying
till green up.

156
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,189
Spring's always
the time to do them things.

157
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,298
Then it'll be next
green up and the next.

158
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:58,208
I don't feeI nothing.

159
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:01,024
Like... What do you mean?

160
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:03,742
I don't know.

161
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,008
Come on. Come on.

162
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:12,064
Dinner.

163
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,625
Come on.

164
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,604
Better make it just a
dipping, June, or them

165
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:18,879
hungry mouths
will eat that table bare.

166
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:22,427
Ma. Come here.

167
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:27,742
Ma. Do I...

168
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:30,265
Do I like Dave?

169
00:13:30,882 --> 00:13:33,948
Why, honey,
I think you do.

170
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,413
Like you like Pappy?

171
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:44,828
Well, you remember when
Dave went to Pokey Wells,

172
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:48,446
you was a-grieving for him
then, weren't you?

173
00:13:48,514 --> 00:13:52,159
And when he's to home, he
don't make no nevermind to you?

174
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,141
- But, Ma...
- Melissa,

175
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:55,902
the folks are waiting for their dinner.

176
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,400
Coming.

177
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,801
Well, that's
liking, honey.

178
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:17,563
This here man wants
to talk to you, Judd.

179
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:18,845
Does, huh?

180
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,856
My name is Hale,
Jack Hale.

181
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:25,019
I wonder if I could
see you alone.

182
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,236
Here's all right.

183
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:27,419
Well, I...

184
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:31,905
You see, I wanted to
talk to you about coaI.

185
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:36,857
The coaI on your property,
I mean.

186
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,544
You know what I mean? The
fault down about a mile.

187
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:42,336
Well, you've seen the coaI.
You know what I mean.

188
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:45,785
The fault. The Alton people,
I'm with them and they...

189
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:49,178
You was talking
about coaI.

190
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,363
Oh, yes. CoaI.

191
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:51,863
There'll be a railroad
up along the Ticopi

192
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:53,499
and then down across
the ridge to your place.

193
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,683
Who said there would?

194
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:56,281
I mean, of course,
if it's agreeable with

195
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,493
the contracting parties,
like yourself.

196
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,505
The thing will make you rich.
There's no doubt about that.

197
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,626
And if we can
make a deaI...

198
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,106
Who's the others?

199
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:06,201
The contract with you
is for the coaI.

200
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,452
Who is the others?

201
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:10,556
Well, there's severaI
other people, but mainly...

202
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:18,263
How long have you had that?

203
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:19,713
You ain't
answered me yet.

204
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,470
When did this arm begin
to show that color?

205
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,610
Three days ago now,
I think.

206
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,803
Get me some
warm water, quick.

207
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:29,303
It ain't bad, is it?

208
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,713
Bad?
It's gangrenous infection.

209
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,273
The flesh,
it's rotting, it's dying.

210
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:34,524
You ain't no doctor.

211
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,154
You wanna live,
don't you?

212
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:38,465
Why didn't you get this
man to a doctor? Did.

213
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,222
There it be. Snake brew.
You fooI.

214
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,680
He'll die if something isn't done.

215
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,244
Am I dying, Judd?

216
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:47,549
Sure.

217
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:50,040
Better start making
the pine box, I guess.

218
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:53,660
That's just what you will be
doing if something isn't done.

219
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:57,118
Now listen to me.

220
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:59,074
Once an infection like
this sets in, it kills.

221
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,954
The only possible cure is
to cut it out, and then pray.

222
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,710
Now do you understand?

223
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,200
No. No.
They don't understand.

224
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:09,121
They don't understand nothing
but shooting and killing.

225
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:10,943
That's all they understand.
Melissa.

226
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:14,142
I been begging you to get a
doctor, but no, you got to plan.

227
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,625
You got to scheme, you got to
figure out how to kill. All of you.

228
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:22,112
Your crops could rot
and your cattle starve.

229
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:24,830
And you wouldn't care as long as
you was back of a squirreI rifle,

230
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:27,713
and here was a Falin
at the other end of it.

231
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:31,964
Now it's getting back
at you. He's dying.

232
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:36,380
You heard him say it.
My Davie's dying.

233
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:38,140
Melissa.

234
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:47,640
Here.

235
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,369
I'm sorry,
I didn't know...

236
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,035
Here.

237
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:54,754
Get me a cloth,
a tourniquet.

238
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,135
Something to tighten around his
arm and shut off the circulation.

239
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:03,198
Get me some small knives,
the sharpest you've got.

240
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:06,750
Get that fire going. Heat the
knives till they're white-hot.

241
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:11,357
Keep that down and
help me steady his arm.

242
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:33,629
This is going to hurt.
We have no anesthetic.

243
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:36,219
Something to put you to sleep, I mean.

244
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:41,370
Better stouting up the corn
liquor with a little pepper.

245
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,742
Looks like
I'm gonna need it.

246
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:57,307
<i>Ain't got no money,
nowhere to spend it</i>

247
00:18:57,379 --> 00:19:01,241
<i>Ain't got no wife,
too independent</i>

248
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:05,886
<i>Ain't got no mule
to ride around</i>

249
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,719
<i>It's just because I'm
the poorest man in town</i>

250
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:16,384
<i>Poor me
Poor me</i>

251
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,280
<i>I wonder when I'm gonna end this misery</i>

252
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,689
I made up that
last line myself.

253
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:24,794
Yeah? That's what
it sounded like.

254
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:27,287
Thinking maybe you might have
a job for me, so I moseyed up.

255
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:30,297
Well, mosey down,
and the quicker the better.

256
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:31,615
What you got your back up for, mister?

257
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:33,308
Go on, get on.

258
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:37,697
They're talking
down in town as to how

259
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,388
your boss saved
Dave Tolliver's life.

260
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:41,728
That so?
Yes, the idiot.

261
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:43,223
Two minutes
after he'd met him,

262
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:45,600
he's carving his initials
in the fellow's arm.

263
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,903
And does it get him
anything? It does not.

264
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,312
The whole thing's a washout.

265
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:51,418
No coaI, no railroad.

266
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:55,746
And as for this Judd Tolliver, he's
just an ungratefuI chunk of dry rot.

267
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,057
They didn't ask him,
did they?

268
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:01,592
Ask him what?

269
00:20:02,338 --> 00:20:03,767
To save Dave's life.

270
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:07,071
Of course they didn't,
you walking phonograph.

271
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:09,473
But what's that
got to do with it?

272
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:12,121
We ones
is funny people.

273
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:15,769
Mmm. Elderberries.

274
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:21,912
Elderberries?

275
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:34,429
Okay, partner, here's
where I get off the train.

276
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:36,058
Ain't I gonna
see you no more?

277
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,624
Well, I don't know.

278
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,381
Not unless your dad
changes his mind.

279
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:42,207
Now, don't you think
you'd better run along home?

280
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,023
First, could I put my arms around you?

281
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:47,425
Can you?
I'll say you can.

282
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,819
Say, you won't forget
your lesson, will you?

283
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:50,938
Uh-uh.

284
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,898
Book learning
is good for people

285
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:55,134
because it makes them build
what's inside of them.

286
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:56,315
Swell.

287
00:20:56,738 --> 00:21:00,033
Some day I'm gonna build a
automobile, I'm gonna build a plane...

288
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,440
Whoa! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

289
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:02,935
And all those things
you told me about.

290
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,992
Well, if you're
gonna do all that,

291
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,652
you'd better go home
and start studying.

292
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,097
Bye.
Goodbye.

293
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:09,340
Come on, Tuffy,
grab the coaI car.

294
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,681
There you go.

295
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:28,186
Well?

296
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:31,323
Pappy wants to see you.

297
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:33,085
He saw me,
I'm sorry to say.

298
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,421
He changed his mind.

299
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:38,266
You mean
he'll sign the agreement?

300
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,865
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

301
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:47,198
Wait a minute.
This isn't a gag, is it?

302
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,281
A what?

303
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:50,427
Skip it.
I'll take a chance.

304
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:52,320
This way. It's shorter.

305
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:03,802
<i>Love is everywhere</i>

306
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:07,190
<i>Its music fills the air</i>

307
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,163
You gonna
talk to me now?

308
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:13,918
Not a chance. Not even if your
father signed 40 contracts.

309
00:22:13,986 --> 00:22:15,262
I'm just as stubborn
as you are, young lady.

310
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,218
And not word you get out of
me untiI you've apologized.

311
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:18,329
I didn't do nothing.

312
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:20,290
You didn't do nothing?
What do you call nothing?

313
00:22:20,354 --> 00:22:22,743
You were going to spit in my
eyes. You stomped on my foot.

314
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,990
And when I tried to teach Buddie
his ABCs, you laughed at me.

315
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:27,000
And you call that
nothing?

316
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:32,955
Oh, my!
What a nice pretty.

317
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,073
Where'd you get it?

318
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,258
It's just a...
Can I have it?

319
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,279
Why...

320
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,493
I can?
Well, ain't that sweet?

321
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,753
What do you say
to apologize?

322
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:44,957
Just say, " Mr. Hale, I regret
exceedingly my unfortunate error. "

323
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:46,041
Them's hard words.

324
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,837
All right.
Say it your own way.

325
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:55,009
I regret.

326
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,961
You regret what?

327
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:58,552
I'm apologizing.

328
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:02,366
All right. What do
you wanna talk about?

329
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:04,027
Don't make no difference.

330
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:05,408
All right.
Let's talk about you.

331
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:07,546
I'd like that.

332
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:10,652
Well, some day very soon now,
your father will have money,

333
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,380
and you'll be
married to Dave.

334
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,272
And what a lucky girI
you are.

335
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,024
And all this
around here will be...

336
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:17,560
Well, maybe over there
will be a big house

337
00:23:17,634 --> 00:23:20,253
and with a lawn
way down to here, and...

338
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,926
Did you ever see
a grasshopper reaI close?

339
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:27,034
Have him spit in my eye?
Not me.

340
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,375
You see that little
yellow spot on its leg?

341
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,068
Well, if you touch it,
you know what will happen?

342
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:32,315
No. I give up. What?

343
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:33,815
Its leg will pop off.

344
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,548
You little savage.

345
00:23:36,994 --> 00:23:38,171
Am I?

346
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:40,511
Yes, you are. And when I
see Dave, I'm gonna tell him.

347
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:42,521
Let's walk. It's a
mite near a mile here.

348
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:43,577
A mile?

349
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,658
I thought you said
this was a shortcut.

350
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:47,159
Did I?

351
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:55,967
" Its successors
and assigns forever,

352
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,620
" all mines, veins,
seams and beds of coaI

353
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,730
" and all other minerals
whatsoever already found

354
00:24:00,802 --> 00:24:02,744
" or which may
hereafter be found

355
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:06,167
" upon or under all that certain
tract, piece or parceI of land

356
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:07,835
" situate, Iying
and being in the... "

357
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,433
Slow down, man.

358
00:24:09,506 --> 00:24:12,637
Them squirreI tracks and chicken
scratches don't mean nothing to me.

359
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:14,233
You trying to tell me
and Judd your coaI

360
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:15,800
won't be disruptious
to our corn?

361
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:17,084
Is that what
you're trying to tell us?

362
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:18,561
That's right.

363
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:20,284
And we get quite
a toting of money?

364
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:23,223
$5,000 in 30 days and a percentage
of the company's earnings.

365
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:24,607
What's that percentage?

366
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:27,609
It's like pigs, Pappy. You get one
out of six for taking care of them.

367
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:29,143
Oh! Figures sensible.

368
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,375
Mr. Hale, is this the kind of
steam shoveI you told me about?

369
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:35,391
Yes, but you look
in the back, Buddie,

370
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,887
and you'll find
a great big one.

371
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:38,647
- I'll say...
- Dave says it's sensible.

372
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:40,151
I guess it's sensible.

373
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:42,015
But there's
one thing eating me.

374
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,129
What's that, Mr. Tolliver?

375
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:44,631
Is there no other way
for you to build

376
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:46,648
your railroad
up to our place,

377
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:48,129
except across the Falins?

378
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:50,266
But it won't be the Falins. The
company will own the property.

379
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:52,062
Yeah, but it were
the Falins.

380
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,497
They walked on it. They
drove the sheep across it.

381
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:56,155
The spring water
down by the Knuckle,

382
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:58,080
they put their
poisonous faces in it.

383
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,934
It's got the
Falins' smell on it.

384
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:02,752
And me ones will make
money going on it? No.

385
00:25:02,818 --> 00:25:04,509
No. There ain't
gonna be a Tolliver...

386
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:07,894
It ain't gonna stop you from
shooting the dirty swine, is it?

387
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,036
The land was here long afore
they come. It's tetched with God.

388
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:12,383
And he ain't going to
taint it just 'cause

389
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,871
a lot of snakes is
a- crawling in the fallows.

390
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,728
We been poor-hogging long enough.
I got a chance for fancies,

391
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:18,808
and I'm gonna have them.

392
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:19,962
That ain't no talk
to your pappy.

393
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:20,982
I'm talking
to you, too!

394
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:22,007
I ought to
spank your hide.

395
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:23,708
You don't need no fotch-on
clothes to be happy.

396
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:26,396
Just a minute, Dave. I didn't
want to start an argument.

397
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:27,808
Mr. Tolliver, I don't
doubt that you have

398
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:29,183
every reason
to hate the Falins.

399
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,395
They must have done
you a great wrong...

400
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:32,190
We don't want no preacher talk from you.

401
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:34,746
The Tollivers don't like
the Falins and they know why.

402
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:37,088
And we don't want to be
learned off by no outsiders.

403
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:38,299
But, Dave,
I'm not trying to...

404
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,450
You saved my life.

405
00:25:39,522 --> 00:25:41,888
You was leaving without a
squeaI when we turned you down.

406
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,928
You couldn't have done that
without you was meaning right.

407
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,141
Just don't argue,
that's all.

408
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:52,795
Where do we sign?

409
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:56,991
Right here.

410
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:17,758
The company's
offering you $5,000.

411
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,997
That's a lot of money,
Mr. Falin.

412
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,560
Both sides of our right
of way will still be yours.

413
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:23,543
It won't interfere
with your farming.

414
00:26:23,618 --> 00:26:24,927
Mr. Thurber here can
vouch for our company.

415
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:26,041
He's kept its books
for years.

416
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:27,739
Yes. That's right.
Indeed it is.

417
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,079
We don't want no taiI-ender
drippings of a Tolliver.

418
00:26:30,145 --> 00:26:31,607
Wade's right. You can't make
butter out of goose grease.

419
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:32,860
Shut up!

420
00:26:34,274 --> 00:26:35,834
What did
Judd Tolliver say?

421
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:37,694
Well, he said that...

422
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:44,859
He said he'd rot before he had
anything to do with a Falin.

423
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:48,065
That sounds like Judd.

424
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:55,004
Where do I scratch?

425
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,139
Right here
on the bottom line.

426
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:28,762
Jack, give us a hand.

427
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,360
You know something
about carpentry.

428
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:31,776
What's the matter with it?
You're doing all right.

429
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:33,271
Yeah, I'm not running
any kindergarten.

430
00:28:33,346 --> 00:28:34,720
I got very little use
for children.

431
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:35,964
In fact
I hate the brats.

432
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:37,179
Look at me.
Look what I'm doing.

433
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,389
If any of
my friends saw me...

434
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,603
Say, did you send that
check to Judd Tolliver?

435
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:43,324
Yeah, this morning. Listen.
Would you put a naiI in here?

436
00:28:43,394 --> 00:28:46,742
Or... Don't let me
keep you.

437
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,688
Going 'coon hunting, Dave?

438
00:29:09,922 --> 00:29:11,034
Skunk.

439
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,508
Mighty nigh well,
ain't it?

440
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:18,105
That's why
I'm going hunting.

441
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:19,967
I don't want you to
fight, Dave.

442
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:21,560
Leave the Falins be.

443
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:23,521
There's turning over
to be done.

444
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:26,303
And I'll be wanting corn
husks for my mattresses.

445
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,566
And we got scrapple to make
and all kinds of things.

446
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:32,827
You're the only
big boy I've got, Dave.

447
00:29:33,378 --> 00:29:34,555
Families round
about got lots.

448
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,032
Maybe they wouldn't
miss them none.

449
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:38,076
Maybe they wouldn't.

450
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:41,822
You're always snorting preachments,
Auntie. You make me sick.

451
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,347
Two pink-eyed doves
sitting in a tree.

452
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:51,067
One for you
and one for me.

453
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:55,098
Dave.

454
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,730
My eggs.

455
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:02,169
Ma! Pa! Dave!
We just got a letter.

456
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:04,535
We just got a letter.

457
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:06,941
Pa. A letter.

458
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,057
Juny.

459
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,016
We just got a letter.

460
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:12,187
A man gave to me
up the road.

461
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,095
Ma, look!

462
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,504
You act like
we never got one before.

463
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:19,708
We got one when Dave
come to live with us

464
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,982
and then we got
another one when...

465
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:24,281
Who's it for?

466
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:26,142
Whoever it's writ
to on the front.

467
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:27,551
Sure enough.

468
00:30:28,802 --> 00:30:30,427
Well, might as well
open it.

469
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:33,051
What for? We ain't going
to be no better off.

470
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,682
Well, you ain't
much help.

471
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:36,248
Open her up
anyway, Judd.

472
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,184
It's from
the coaI company. See?

473
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,159
There's a picture
of a mine on it.

474
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,269
$5,000.

475
00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:04,664
It's just
a piece of paper.

476
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,995
This here's a check.

477
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,920
I seen one once
in Gaptown.

478
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:12,124
Folks, we're richer
than cream cheese.

479
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:14,649
And I can get the things
I want, can't I, Pappy?

480
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,110
Now, now, now.
Not so jumpy.

481
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:18,494
There's one thing
we got to get

482
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:20,449
more important
than that first,

483
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,936
and that's
a new dress for Melissa.

484
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:26,108
Oh! Judd.

485
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,120
You sure got it
coming to you, Mammy.

486
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:29,950
With pearl buttons it'll
have. Won't it, Pappy?

487
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:32,123
Yeah, pearI buttons.
And the next thing

488
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:34,975
we got to get is hat
and shoes for Mammy.

489
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:40,031
It just...
You're making me cry.

490
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:44,255
Judd Tolliver, you said
you weren't talking to me.

491
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:47,834
That was when
I was poor. $5,000.

492
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,661
Wait a minute. I got
some choosing to do, too.

493
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:51,006
Part of that's mine.

494
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:52,416
Sure. Half.

495
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,521
Half? I get way less than half.

496
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:56,448
My land's just
a little hog bag.

497
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:01,977
Which way says
you win or lose?

498
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,457
North.

499
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:09,334
South. You lose, so you get half.

500
00:32:17,313 --> 00:32:19,899
You know the first thing
I'm gonna buy?

501
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:21,852
Dave Tolliver,
get some pepper in you.

502
00:32:21,921 --> 00:32:23,066
What?

503
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:24,217
For more than
a month now,

504
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:26,078
somebody's been a
- keeping a secret in a closet.

505
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:28,961
And I'm thinking maybe it's a
picture of something she's a-needing.

506
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:30,236
So the first thing
I'm gonna do...

507
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:31,516
Oh, no. Now, Dave.

508
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:32,796
Yes, now.

509
00:32:32,866 --> 00:32:34,011
Dave, don't.

510
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:38,527
Dave.
Can't hear. Both ears is bad.

511
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:40,503
If you go in that closet...

512
00:32:40,578 --> 00:32:43,228
Next time I'll puff you
clean over to Coon Hollow.

513
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:50,368
If you go in there, I'll
never talk to you again.

514
00:32:50,434 --> 00:32:52,376
Why, it's only fun. There
ain't nothing in there you want.

515
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:54,108
Nothing that'd be
important to you. June.

516
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:55,422
Never.
I only want to buy...

517
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,602
Never.

518
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,649
Dave.

519
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,296
You're sure pretty.

520
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:08,726
Am I?

521
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:11,768
Like a budding sapling without
even room for a robin to sit.

522
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:14,591
You're just silly.

523
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:17,625
I been silly ever since the
sap come up out of the trees.

524
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:19,191
I get silly
just looking at you.

525
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,367
When we get married...

526
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:22,489
It ain't green up yet.

527
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:23,968
You're going to have
ivory combs in your hair

528
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,528
and you're gonna have
blood-red wine to drink.

529
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:27,009
Wine?

530
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:29,408
And down by the sty,
we'll build a big house...

531
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:31,895
With grass growing
all the way down?

532
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,264
The ivory combs,
they was my idea.

533
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:37,271
And the big house?

534
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:38,687
Mr. Hale.
He thought of that.

535
00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:40,063
He's drawn me
a piece of paper.

536
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:41,339
It's got a bathtub
in it, June.

537
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:42,587
In the middle
of the house it is.

538
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:45,046
And it's get water that can
be turned on with the handle.

539
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:46,583
And there's a room where
you keep babies, and it's...

540
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,446
Get out of here, Dave.

541
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:49,979
Honey.

542
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,108
Dave, please.

543
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,242
Sure.

544
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:26,334
<i>Love is everywhere</i>

545
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:29,217
<i>Its music fills the air</i>

546
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:35,320
<i>All nature seems to hum
"A melody from the sky!"</i>

547
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:41,755
<i>Over on the hill,
I see a whippoorwill</i>

548
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:47,008
<i>I hear its song become
"A melody from the sky!"</i>

549
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:54,269
<i>And there's a bluebird
singing to his lady love above</i>

550
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,663
<i>A love song</i>

551
00:34:56,737 --> 00:35:00,698
<i>taken from the whispering
breeze in the trees</i>

552
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:03,001
<i>Love is everywhere</i>

553
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:07,257
<i>Its music fills the air</i>

554
00:35:07,361 --> 00:35:11,136
<i>All nature seems to hum</i>

555
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:15,837
<i>"A melody from the sky!"</i>

556
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:18,582
By Juckies, that's what I
call whistling and singing.

557
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:20,959
I'm awfuI glad
to see you, Tater.

558
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,752
Well, you never was before.

559
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:24,159
You've changed.
You're different.

560
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:26,527
You're... I'm awfuI glad to see you.

561
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:27,608
You said that.

562
00:35:27,682 --> 00:35:29,787
Did I?
Well, I am glad.

563
00:35:30,241 --> 00:35:32,729
Well, here he is, safe
and delivered. So long.

564
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,077
Bye, Tater.

565
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:36,666
Goodbye, engineer. And don't
forget what Mr. Hale told you.

566
00:35:36,738 --> 00:35:38,265
Watch the steam
in your boiler.

567
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:41,407
<i>Love is everywhere</i>

568
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:44,408
<i>Its music fills the air</i>

569
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:50,969
<i>All nature seems to hum
"A melody from the sky!"</i>

570
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:55,834
<i>Love is everywhere</i>

571
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:09,368
David, get away
from there.

572
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:15,966
Dave, you ain't said nothing
about my steam shoveI.

573
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,682
Your... Is that what it is?

574
00:36:18,753 --> 00:36:20,444
Yeah. It works, too.

575
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:22,265
Uncle Jack,
he showed me...

576
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:23,646
Uncle Jack?

577
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:28,892
Uh-huh. Mr. Hale. You know. He
said, " When this thing gets up here,

578
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:32,729
" you got to pull this thing. "
See? See how it works?

579
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:35,837
Hemlocks. Mr. Hale's
sure smart, ain't he?

580
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:41,120
Bet he is. Sis, she says he's
the smartestest man she ever seen.

581
00:36:42,177 --> 00:36:43,486
She said what?

582
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:48,029
Sure works, don't it?

583
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:51,223
I'm wanna be an engineer,
too, when I get big.

584
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:56,214
When did June say
that about Mr. Hale?

585
00:36:57,409 --> 00:37:01,468
She says it all the time, every day
at most, when she takes me down there.

586
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:03,512
She takes you
down there every day?

587
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:06,269
Uh-huh.
I sit with Corsey, I do.

588
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:07,581
Corsey?

589
00:37:07,649 --> 00:37:09,056
He's an engineer.

590
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:10,910
He's the best, he is.

591
00:37:13,473 --> 00:37:16,539
What does June do when
you're with Corsey, Buddie?

592
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:18,912
She goes walking
with Uncle Jack.

593
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:20,766
They don't
bother me at all.

594
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:26,367
Now watch me.
Tuffy, go on.

595
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,026
Go get some coaI.

596
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:31,126
Go on,
go get some coaI.

597
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:33,050
Oh! Buddie.

598
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:34,646
Huh?

599
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,107
Nothing.

600
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:54,679
Mr. Thurber,
Mr. Thurber.

601
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:56,662
Hello, Buddie.

602
00:38:57,217 --> 00:38:58,941
I hope he ain't no bother
to you, Mr. Thurber.

603
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,700
Bother! Really
I'm compelled to laugh.

604
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:02,176
This charming
little fellow.

605
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:03,386
Ridiculous, Miss Tolliver.

606
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:05,050
It's only when you've
seen the world like I have,

607
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:07,325
that you learn to appreciate
the laughter of children.

608
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:09,727
Their childish pranks
and their naive questions.

609
00:39:09,793 --> 00:39:12,444
I remember once on the boat
coming over from England.

610
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:15,164
There was dear little curly-headed
fellow, he must have been about...

611
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:17,142
June, there's
Mr. Corsey.

612
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:19,835
Corsey.

613
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:22,872
Howdy, son.
What's holding you up?

614
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:24,319
Come on.

615
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,156
How are you this morning?
All right.

616
00:39:28,225 --> 00:39:30,592
Atta boy!
Whoops-a-daisy.

617
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:31,966
Charming child.

618
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:33,179
Yes.

619
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:41,531
Mr. Thurber, you better check with Mills

620
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:42,746
about that last
carload of ties.

621
00:39:42,817 --> 00:39:45,305
They weren't creosoted.
They can't...

622
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:48,665
Again?

623
00:39:48,897 --> 00:39:50,075
Mmm-hmm.

624
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:55,230
I'm busy.
Come on, get up.

625
00:39:57,441 --> 00:39:58,489
You can see that,
can't you?

626
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,903
Uh-huh.

627
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:01,017
Well?

628
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,104
Mmm-hmm.

629
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:04,348
You call that an answer?
Mmm-hmm.

630
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:05,944
Listen,
Miss Uh-uh and Uh-huh.

631
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:07,511
Outside, up the hill
to your family.

632
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:09,014
You've probably got
plenty of work to do.

633
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:10,333
And don't say uh-huh.
Uh-uh.

634
00:40:12,962 --> 00:40:13,976
Woman, you're a nut.

635
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:15,391
Good. I like that.

636
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:16,504
You like being a nut.

637
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:17,559
No, being a woman.

638
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,542
UntiI now, you've been
thinking I'm a girI.

639
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,072
You're not a woman.
You're not even a girI.

640
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:23,356
I ain't?

641
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:26,400
No, you're just a child
no bigger than that.

642
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:28,662
And from here up?

643
00:40:28,737 --> 00:40:30,744
I'm not fooling you. I'm
going to tell you something.

644
00:40:30,817 --> 00:40:33,184
What do you do
with your spare time?

645
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:35,224
This is very interesting.

646
00:40:38,178 --> 00:40:39,388
Now, stop your clowning.

647
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:40,951
June, you're making
a big mistake.

648
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:42,137
Pretty soon
you'll be married to Dave,

649
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:43,420
and what have
you done about it?

650
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:45,431
What do you want me to do?

651
00:40:45,825 --> 00:40:47,319
I want you to
go to schooI.

652
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:49,051
To what?
SchooI.

653
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:52,056
Can't you realize what the future
holds for you and your family?

654
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:53,241
Uh-huh.

655
00:40:53,313 --> 00:40:55,833
All right, what?
A fight with the Falins.

656
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:57,818
You're impossible.

657
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,803
I ain't impossible.

658
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:00,985
I'd like to know
what you'd call it.

659
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:02,105
I can listen.

660
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:03,160
You can?

661
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:04,924
All right, listen to this.
Look at Buddie.

662
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:06,848
He's a swell little kid
and he's smart as a whip.

663
00:41:06,913 --> 00:41:08,506
He'll learn
and he'll learn fast.

664
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:10,584
And the minute he arrives,
these mountains can't hold him.

665
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:12,413
He'll change, June, and
you'll he proud of him,

666
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:15,678
but you'll be unhappy too because
he'll speak a different language.

667
00:41:15,745 --> 00:41:18,331
You're smart and
I can understand you.

668
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:20,535
Look, June, I'm not trying
to hurt your feelings.

669
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:22,202
I think
you're a swell girI.

670
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:23,451
But if you ever
were in the city once,

671
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:25,343
just once, you'd understand what I mean.

672
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:26,903
Remember what
you told me yesterday.

673
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:28,504
None of you
could read that check.

674
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:30,104
$5,000.
But you just guessed at it

675
00:41:30,177 --> 00:41:32,086
because there was a picture
of a coaI mine on it.

676
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:33,306
And from now on,
Dave and your father

677
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:34,489
will be getting
lots of letters.

678
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:36,220
See what I mean?

679
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:37,466
I ain't going to no town.

680
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,904
You don't have to. You can get
some books and read at home.

681
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,017
Hire a teacher.

682
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:42,943
You've got money,
and you'll have more.

683
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:44,416
And once you get into it,
you'll be so blamed happy

684
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:46,008
you'll want to
give me a big hug.

685
00:41:46,081 --> 00:41:47,259
Would I?

686
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,056
Hello.
Hale speaking, Operator.

687
00:41:58,241 --> 00:42:00,608
Hello, Lewis.
What's on your mind?

688
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,656
You what?

689
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:04,953
You want me to
come to town?

690
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:06,776
Listen, I've got
some bulldogs up here

691
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:08,540
by the name of
Tolliver and Falin.

692
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,170
And if I leave...

693
00:42:10,817 --> 00:42:12,540
Yeah, Lewis, but I...

694
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,136
Oh...

695
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,110
All right. Yeah.

696
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:19,421
I'll leave in the morning.
Right.

697
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:22,650
Hey, wait a minute.
What about those ties?

698
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:24,127
You did, huh?

699
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:29,594
Okay, I'll see you soon.

700
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:31,770
Well, June,
it looks like...

701
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:46,431
The mountains is good enough for
us. They're good enough for you.

702
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,707
You ain't
a- going to town.

703
00:42:47,777 --> 00:42:48,955
But, Judd...

704
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,545
I'm a-talking.
The idea.

705
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:54,519
You getting close to marrying
time and wanting to go to schooI.

706
00:42:54,593 --> 00:42:57,343
You gonna make clabber cheese any
better if you can read and write?

707
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,962
Or churn butter or fix
a shirt or mend socks?

708
00:43:00,033 --> 00:43:02,040
That's what a wife
is supposed to do.

709
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:04,666
Don't take no education to show
you where a hen lays her eggs.

710
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:05,981
I ain't gonna listen
to any more.

711
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,259
June.

712
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,644
Yeah, and you can use it
till the blood comes.

713
00:43:11,713 --> 00:43:13,022
But I won't change my mind.

714
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:14,169
You and the mountains
ain't going to make

715
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,314
no dried up
cornstalk out of me.

716
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,424
You ain't got the right.

717
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:20,919
I'm gonna be smart
and I'm gonna think.

718
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:23,033
Yes, I am. And I'm
gonna be a help to Dave

719
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:24,698
when those checks
start coming in.

720
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,940
You ain't ever been to the city.
You don't know what it means.

721
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:28,667
You're going to
stay here.

722
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:30,144
And be a cull,
just like Mammy?

723
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:31,387
June.

724
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:34,493
She knows
what I'm driving at.

725
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:36,252
She ain't never
get to go no place.

726
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,077
Just stayed here
and dried up.

727
00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:39,801
Getting older,
faster than she should.

728
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:41,050
Weren't you, Mammy?

729
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,583
I was born old.

730
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,626
She could have been
young and beautifuI.

731
00:43:45,697 --> 00:43:49,471
She is beautifuI.
Listen, June child.

732
00:43:49,537 --> 00:43:51,391
I ain't no mean father.

733
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:54,140
I mean, I ain't
a never wanting to be.

734
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:57,854
You looked at me just
like a stranger, just now.

735
00:43:57,921 --> 00:44:00,026
Kind of hurt inside.

736
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:02,970
Pappy.

737
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:10,270
Sure be glad to give
you a lift, Miss June.

738
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:12,890
This animaI of mine will carry
double and get you to Gaptown

739
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:15,066
quicker than a hound dog
can smell a pole cat.

740
00:44:15,137 --> 00:44:16,664
That's very nice
of you, Mr. Keever

741
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,071
but I'm a-waiting,
a friend, you know.

742
00:44:19,137 --> 00:44:20,119
Oh!

743
00:44:21,313 --> 00:44:24,215
The smell of winter's stouter
than horse radish.

744
00:44:24,288 --> 00:44:26,328
Hope it don't
kick up a rain.

745
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:28,087
Goodbye.
Bye.

746
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,448
Where you going?

747
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:00,830
That a way.

748
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:02,426
Just a stroll?

749
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:03,958
Oh, no. Going to town.

750
00:45:04,737 --> 00:45:07,552
Smell of winter's
stouter than horse radish.

751
00:45:13,248 --> 00:45:14,907
Thought you told me
you'd never been to town.

752
00:45:14,977 --> 00:45:16,700
Might, might not.

753
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:18,588
Hope it don't
kick up a rain.

754
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:22,108
I give up.
Come on, get in.

755
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,566
No. I wouldn't. It
might be putting you out.

756
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,550
It's only a short hop
and a tussle to town.

757
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,185
Get in.

758
00:45:33,408 --> 00:45:35,678
Say, if it's any of my business,
why are you going to town?

759
00:45:35,745 --> 00:45:38,592
Education. Do you have to keep
your foot on the brake all the time?

760
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:40,249
When did you
get that idea?

761
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,531
I see you keep
jiggling it back and...

762
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:43,193
You know what I mean.
When?

763
00:45:43,872 --> 00:45:45,214
Talking to people.

764
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,491
Who?

765
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:48,219
Oh, about.

766
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:50,656
It was what
I told you, wasn't it?

767
00:45:51,137 --> 00:45:52,599
Did you?

768
00:45:52,673 --> 00:45:53,917
Yes, you was
one of them.

769
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,545
I was all of them.

770
00:45:55,617 --> 00:45:58,748
Now see here, I meant what
I said. I sincerely meant it.

771
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:00,727
But you're up to
something phony.

772
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,623
People don't just get
an idea and then go.

773
00:46:02,689 --> 00:46:05,755
Did you ever stand under a falling
tree or see a pole cat back up?

774
00:46:05,825 --> 00:46:07,450
That's not funny.

775
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:09,113
What did your father
say about it, and Dave?

776
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,454
They was mostly agreeing,
especially Dave.

777
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:12,982
He said when those checks
start traipsing in...

778
00:46:13,057 --> 00:46:14,399
I said that.

779
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:16,861
All right, I'll walk.

780
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:28,059
Same thing eating you?

781
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:29,405
Huh?

782
00:46:29,473 --> 00:46:31,448
Sure makes me
feeI bad.

783
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,244
That's what I wanna
talk to you about.

784
00:46:33,313 --> 00:46:35,222
Nice of you. Horse gets out of the barn

785
00:46:35,297 --> 00:46:37,152
and now you want to
lock the door.

786
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:39,356
Well, he ain't
got her yet.

787
00:46:39,425 --> 00:46:41,465
Who ain't got what...
Wait a minute.

788
00:46:41,537 --> 00:46:43,391
Ain't you and I talking
about the same thing?

789
00:46:43,457 --> 00:46:45,311
You bet we're talking
about the same thing.

790
00:46:45,377 --> 00:46:46,718
I was feeling
when he saved my life

791
00:46:46,785 --> 00:46:48,759
but I just didn't know
what it was then.

792
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:52,695
Fever I says. Or maybe the lead's
splashing something in my eyes.

793
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,624
But I ought to have known. It
was him being nice to Buddie.

794
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:56,031
It was him...
Wait a minute, son.

795
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:57,624
You're making
a gourd trap,

796
00:46:57,697 --> 00:47:01,144
but it's too big to catch meadow
larks and too small to catch ideas.

797
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:02,810
What are you
talking about?

798
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:03,928
Let's get June
right here.

799
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,040
We ones is going to settle
this matter for good.

800
00:47:06,113 --> 00:47:08,284
You want her here?
Fine.

801
00:47:08,352 --> 00:47:09,759
You tell her
she could go to town,

802
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:11,199
now you tell me
you want her here.

803
00:47:11,265 --> 00:47:12,542
Ain't you
a little tetched?

804
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:13,689
I tell her
she can go where?

805
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,135
Into town
to get educated.

806
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:16,990
Got to read books,
she said you said.

807
00:47:17,057 --> 00:47:19,577
Don't want no cull for a
wife, she said you said.

808
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:21,023
She said...
She ain't gone.

809
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,071
You didn't
let her go, did you?

810
00:47:22,144 --> 00:47:24,119
Of course, been gone
maybe two hours now.

811
00:47:24,193 --> 00:47:26,364
Took her down to the ridge
to meet the mailman.

812
00:47:26,432 --> 00:47:28,058
She said...
It was him that done it.

813
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:29,536
Him that said
he was our friend.

814
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:30,943
That's why
he gave us the money.

815
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:33,147
That's why he gave us
the money. You understand?

816
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:34,165
He took her away.

817
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:36,183
He's been wanting to take
her, but he was a-feared.

818
00:47:36,257 --> 00:47:37,501
All right.

819
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:39,325
He thinks now maybe the money
will keep us from telling him

820
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:41,727
that we ones up here
don't take nobody's woman.

821
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,581
Money ain't
a- stopping us from that.

822
00:47:43,649 --> 00:47:44,631
Money ain't
a- stopping us from...

823
00:47:44,705 --> 00:47:47,039
Where are you going?

824
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:48,381
I'm going hunting.

825
00:47:53,857 --> 00:47:55,679
You're sure
that was Dave Tolliver?

826
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:58,614
He was a-headed for the camp
and across our property, too.

827
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:01,242
If he's down there,
he's on our property.

828
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,135
Might just as well
go down and look into it.

829
00:48:03,201 --> 00:48:04,575
That's my job.

830
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,096
I've been sort of shamed since
I only get him in the arm.

831
00:48:07,168 --> 00:48:08,445
You're right.

832
00:48:08,513 --> 00:48:10,422
Rub out
the mistake, Son.

833
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:16,127
So help me,
he isn't here.

834
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,495
On my word of honor, he isn't
here. Do you understand me?

835
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:19,673
Yeah.

836
00:48:19,744 --> 00:48:22,232
He went downtown.
Down to Gaptown, I mean.

837
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:24,028
She didn't go with him?
No, I told you!

838
00:48:24,096 --> 00:48:25,885
He was alone, and... You sure
they didn't meet some place?

839
00:48:25,952 --> 00:48:27,414
With these, I saw him.

840
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,750
He got into his wagon,
on this side...

841
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:31,864
You ain't
answering my question.

842
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:33,725
I can't answer
that 'cause I don't know.

843
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:35,134
I watched him
there on the road.

844
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,313
There was nobody
with him then, because...

845
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,834
Mr. Thurber,
I'm a-quitting.

846
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:56,984
No, you're not.

847
00:49:57,056 --> 00:49:58,485
In times like this,
you gotta be a man.

848
00:49:58,561 --> 00:49:59,771
A man must
never been a coward.

849
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,142
I got to get to Gaptown to tell
the people down there what's up.

850
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,997
But it's over.
There's nothing to tell!

851
00:50:04,065 --> 00:50:05,756
There ain't, eh?
You don't know.

852
00:50:05,825 --> 00:50:08,694
Look at here, Dave Tolliver's
gone to Gaptown to get Mr. Hale.

853
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:10,362
He bust Wade Falin
on the beak.

854
00:50:10,433 --> 00:50:13,051
And when a Tolliver busts a
Falin on the beak, that means war.

855
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,582
And I gotta tell
a- people in Gaptown,

856
00:50:14,656 --> 00:50:16,347
so they can
scuttle for safety.

857
00:50:17,793 --> 00:50:18,938
Good heavens!

858
00:50:26,016 --> 00:50:27,129
Jenkins.

859
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:29,211
Jenkins.

860
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,735
Biggest fight.
Outside camp.

861
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:34,427
Wade Falin came down...
Dave Tolliver...

862
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,684
And shoved him
over the cliff...

863
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:47,904
I knew that thing was
going to break out again.

864
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,968
Just a matter of time
and that's all we needed.

865
00:50:56,161 --> 00:50:57,503
And I was standing
right there.

866
00:50:57,569 --> 00:50:58,779
I heard enough.

867
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,058
And he...

868
00:51:10,753 --> 00:51:12,160
Dave Tolliver
licked Wade Falin.

869
00:51:12,225 --> 00:51:14,167
And now he's coming
to get Mr. Hale.

870
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:21,886
Whoa!

871
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:30,425
Is there anything else you need? No.

872
00:51:30,496 --> 00:51:31,903
Well, if you think of
anything, just call the camp

873
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:34,074
and I'll have one of
the men bring it down.

874
00:51:34,145 --> 00:51:35,933
I'm sorry, but...
Well?

875
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,653
The room, you know, where Miss
Tolliver was going to stay...

876
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,149
Well, that room,
I'm afraid...

877
00:51:40,224 --> 00:51:41,206
Afraid of what?

878
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:42,491
Well, it ain't
a fitting place.

879
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,705
It kind of leaks,
you know.

880
00:51:43,776 --> 00:51:46,591
Hold it. There's trouble,
ain't there?

881
00:51:46,656 --> 00:51:47,769
Trouble?

882
00:51:47,841 --> 00:51:49,815
I can smell it.
What's wrong?

883
00:51:49,888 --> 00:51:51,197
I don't want
no fighting.

884
00:51:51,264 --> 00:51:52,279
Fighting?

885
00:51:52,352 --> 00:51:53,879
Dave.

886
00:51:53,953 --> 00:51:55,000
Say, what is this?

887
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,087
He's coming to get me.

888
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,818
Who told you?
You've seen him?

889
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:01,434
All town knows it. And I don't
want no trouble around here.

890
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:04,958
You gotta go.

891
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:06,301
I've got to what?

892
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:10,045
I know... I've seen him the
time he shot down Jim Falin.

893
00:52:10,112 --> 00:52:11,192
You gotta
get out of town.

894
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:13,020
What have I done to him that
he should want to harm me?

895
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,168
Did I ever
do anything to him?

896
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,287
No, you didn't.

897
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,110
But I wish
I hadn't come down.

898
00:52:18,848 --> 00:52:20,310
Will you go?
Please go.

899
00:52:20,385 --> 00:52:21,367
You lied, didn't you?

900
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:23,350
Everything you said coming
down out of the mountains?

901
00:52:23,424 --> 00:52:24,984
I knew you were Iying then,
and something inside of me

902
00:52:25,056 --> 00:52:27,260
told me I should have
sent you home.

903
00:52:27,328 --> 00:52:28,954
Well, let him come.

904
00:52:29,344 --> 00:52:31,897
I never saw such a ferocious
look in a man's eyes in my life.

905
00:52:31,968 --> 00:52:35,132
I tell you, it's gonna be
the biggest fight of the year.

906
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,414
Dave... Dave come out
of the tent, like a shot.

907
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,942
He lit right on
top of Wade.

908
00:52:42,017 --> 00:52:44,384
And rammed down on him with
a right and left! Right!

909
00:52:44,448 --> 00:52:45,975
Wade got away from Dave.

910
00:52:46,049 --> 00:52:47,739
Dave got him right on the edge
of the cliff, he had him down,

911
00:52:47,808 --> 00:52:48,791
he was beating his
head down and he says,

912
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:50,359
" I'll kill you, I'll
kill you, I'll kill you!

913
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:51,709
" You'll take my girl,
will you?"

914
00:52:51,776 --> 00:52:53,631
He reached him up
and he says...

915
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:56,541
Nice day, ain't it?

916
00:52:56,609 --> 00:52:58,070
Give me a beer.

917
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:01,851
I gotta see somebody.

918
00:53:02,656 --> 00:53:05,045
Yeah, Dave Tolliver.

919
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,935
And how'd you like to
tell him we was here.

920
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,855
In the backroom.

921
00:53:25,217 --> 00:53:27,900
There's Dave Tolliver
coming in now.

922
00:53:27,968 --> 00:53:29,179
And he ain't going out.

923
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:30,394
You can get him
right from here.

924
00:53:30,465 --> 00:53:32,952
We don't have to sneak
our shots at the Tolliver.

925
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:34,486
Stay here, Wade.

926
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:35,572
Hell.

927
00:53:37,568 --> 00:53:40,667
You sing about Stack O' Lee
and keep right on singing.

928
00:53:46,272 --> 00:53:49,120
<i>When the rain
was falling fast</i>

929
00:53:49,536 --> 00:53:52,056
<i>One dark and stormy night</i>

930
00:53:52,384 --> 00:53:57,469
<i>Stack O' Lee and Billy Lyons
Had an awful fight</i>

931
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:02,334
<i>Bad, bad,
bad old Stack O' Lee</i>

932
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:09,914
You ain't going to do nothing,
Dave. It's all my fault.

933
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:11,478
Talk will keep.

934
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:13,182
Now, let's get
this thing straight.

935
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:14,775
You're down here
looking for trouble.

936
00:54:14,848 --> 00:54:17,150
I haven't done anything, but I
can see you won't believe that.

937
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:18,525
All right.

938
00:54:23,873 --> 00:54:25,815
This is worth walking for.

939
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,691
How are you doing, Buck?
Drop them gun.

940
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,484
We're going about
our own business.

941
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:45,886
Of course, you are.
Put them down.

942
00:54:46,624 --> 00:54:47,868
Certainly.

943
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,491
Anything to oblige.

944
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,764
Funny you ain't trying
to stop the fight.

945
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,581
Fist fight
won't do no harm.

946
00:54:55,648 --> 00:54:57,307
Gun toting don't go.

947
00:54:57,729 --> 00:54:59,289
No hard feeling.

948
00:55:00,576 --> 00:55:01,525
No.

949
00:55:02,656 --> 00:55:03,801
No.

950
00:55:27,808 --> 00:55:30,710
You're doing a good job, Mr.
Hale. Maybe we can help you.

951
00:55:39,713 --> 00:55:41,752
So that's the way
it is, huh?

952
00:55:41,824 --> 00:55:42,773
Any way
you wanna look at it.

953
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:44,823
You shouldn't
mess in old troubles.

954
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:57,047
<i>Dogs did howl</i>

955
00:55:57,249 --> 00:55:59,899
<i>Dogs did bark</i>

956
00:55:59,968 --> 00:56:02,838
<i>When Stack O' Lee
the murderer</i>

957
00:56:02,912 --> 00:56:05,465
<i>went creeping
through the dark</i>

958
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:10,234
<i>Bad, bad,
bad old Stack O' Lee</i>

959
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:36,152
Get out of here
and take her with you!

960
00:56:36,224 --> 00:56:37,751
I can run from no Falin.

961
00:56:39,489 --> 00:56:42,969
I guess, here in the mountains
a woman doesn't mean very much.

962
00:56:43,744 --> 00:56:46,232
You came here to get her, didn't you?

963
00:56:50,432 --> 00:56:53,432
<i>Bam, bam, bam, bam</i>

964
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:56,377
<i>Went Stack's 44</i>

965
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,189
<i>Next time I saw Billy Lyons</i>

966
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:01,879
<i>He's stretched out
on the floor</i>

967
00:57:02,624 --> 00:57:06,748
<i>Bad, bad,
bad old Stack O' Lee</i>

968
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:10,875
<i>Stop your drinking whiskey</i>

969
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:12,188
<i>With your...</i>

970
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,856
<i>Look what happened
to poor old Stack O' Lee</i>

971
00:57:21,664 --> 00:57:23,355
Okay, I'm licked.

972
00:57:23,424 --> 00:57:24,569
So what?

973
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,877
You got lots to learn,
Mr. Hale, lots.

974
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,121
I scratched
a bargain with you

975
00:57:28,192 --> 00:57:29,948
on a piece of paper,
and I kept it.

976
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:32,472
But now, you're sticking your
nose in my personaI affairs,

977
00:57:32,544 --> 00:57:34,583
so from now on
bargains don't count.

978
00:57:34,656 --> 00:57:37,275
And you won't be
long finding that out.

979
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,315
Jack! Jack!

980
00:57:56,608 --> 00:57:58,648
Dave Tolliver!
He's coming to get you!

981
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,891
There's going to
be a big fight.

982
00:58:01,504 --> 00:58:02,714
Is there?

983
00:58:21,824 --> 00:58:23,864
What are you doing here?

984
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:25,180
I'm here 'cause
I ain't going back.

985
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:26,425
I thought I told Dave
to take you...

986
00:58:26,496 --> 00:58:28,318
The sheriff said,
"I'm taking you

987
00:58:28,384 --> 00:58:30,522
" to the outskirts of town,
Dave Tolliver.

988
00:58:30,592 --> 00:58:32,153
" I'm leaving the rest
to your own judgment. "

989
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:33,336
Now see here, I'm not
going to allow you...

990
00:58:33,408 --> 00:58:34,488
I ain't listening.

991
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,145
You told me to get an education,
I'm getting an education.

992
00:58:37,216 --> 00:58:40,064
I'm staying here. If I can't stay
here, I'll stay where I can stay.

993
00:58:40,128 --> 00:58:42,015
You can't stop me,
nobody's gonna stop me!

994
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,731
I'll show the whole kit and boodle
of you how much I can get learned.

995
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,425
I'll be smarter than you!
That's what I'll be!

996
00:58:46,496 --> 00:58:48,252
Now listen, you little
stick of dynamite.

997
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,564
You're getting
out of here now.

998
00:58:49,632 --> 00:58:50,941
You're going back
up in the mountains.

999
00:58:51,008 --> 00:58:52,503
I've heard enough of you
and I've seen enough of you.

1000
00:58:52,576 --> 00:58:54,965
For the present, at least.
Now, come on, get out.

1001
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:57,688
You...

1002
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:01,209
All right, I'll go

1003
00:59:02,912 --> 00:59:04,603
if you want me to go.

1004
00:59:04,928 --> 00:59:06,008
Sure.

1005
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,432
I don't want people
not to want me.

1006
00:59:10,784 --> 00:59:12,158
Wait a minute.

1007
00:59:12,736 --> 00:59:14,395
How did you do that?

1008
00:59:14,656 --> 00:59:15,998
Oh, that.

1009
00:59:19,168 --> 00:59:22,299
You did it
when you pushed me down.

1010
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,415
I'm sorry.

1011
00:59:25,248 --> 00:59:26,393
It might have been
a rusty naiI or something.

1012
00:59:26,464 --> 00:59:28,319
We'd better fix it up.
Come over here.

1013
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,858
So that's it, is it?

1014
00:59:36,928 --> 00:59:39,383
And I thought you were just
interested in the coaI business.

1015
00:59:39,456 --> 00:59:40,504
She's hurt her hand.

1016
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:43,740
You've killed your future,
around here, anyway.

1017
00:59:43,808 --> 00:59:46,077
You're not satisfied with
one enemy, you make two.

1018
00:59:46,144 --> 00:59:47,518
You realize
what you've done?

1019
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,454
Now the Falins hate you, the
Tollivers will never forgive you.

1020
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:52,284
The Tollivers, why?
That's why.

1021
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:55,286
That girI's gonna go back
to the mountains, now.

1022
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,749
She didn't come here to start
any trouble, it just happened.

1023
00:59:57,824 --> 01:00:00,475
She's got a mind of her own, and
if she wants to stay here she can.

1024
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:01,820
In this town?
Impossible.

1025
01:00:01,888 --> 01:00:03,132
I'll take her
to Brighton.

1026
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,956
Or Plenny or Sand Creek. It
doesn't matter where you take her

1027
01:00:05,024 --> 01:00:06,333
around here, you're
about to meet Tollivers.

1028
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,123
All right, I'll take her
to Louisville to my sister.

1029
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:09,785
What do you think of that?
Nothing.

1030
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,383
Except that
I'm flabbergasted.

1031
01:00:11,456 --> 01:00:12,765
Nonplussed.

1032
01:00:12,832 --> 01:00:13,977
And if you
don't mind me saying so,

1033
01:00:14,048 --> 01:00:16,153
I think you're just
a little bit nuts.

1034
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,324
Thank you.

1035
01:00:21,024 --> 01:00:22,300
Both of you.

1036
01:00:55,616 --> 01:00:58,649
Mr. Hale! Oh, Mr. Hale!
You forgot the hat.

1037
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,832
Thanks, Leo.

1038
01:01:09,376 --> 01:01:10,488
Well, here you are.

1039
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,640
Do I...

1040
01:01:11,712 --> 01:01:13,949
Are you sure your
sister will recognize me?

1041
01:01:14,016 --> 01:01:15,674
I don't see
how she can miss.

1042
01:01:15,744 --> 01:01:17,151
Do I look all right?

1043
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:19,638
My dear young lady,
reticent as I am by nature,

1044
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:21,140
it behooves me at
this moment to tell you

1045
01:01:21,216 --> 01:01:23,005
that you're wearing the
finest the city affords.

1046
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:24,348
All aboard!

1047
01:01:25,216 --> 01:01:27,126
Well, you better get on.

1048
01:01:31,456 --> 01:01:34,652
Ain't... Ain't you
gonna kiss me goodbye?

1049
01:02:03,104 --> 01:02:04,730
Well, that's over with.
Is it?

1050
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,004
Yeah. What do
you mean, " Is it"?

1051
01:02:07,072 --> 01:02:08,446
No, I mean, I'm glad it's over with.

1052
01:02:08,512 --> 01:02:09,854
Are you?

1053
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,447
She's nuts.
Is she?

1054
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,014
Sure she is.
Any fooI can see that.

1055
01:02:13,088 --> 01:02:15,030
Well, perhaps, that's
why I'm a little stupid.

1056
01:02:15,104 --> 01:02:16,348
Yeah, maybe that's...

1057
01:02:16,416 --> 01:02:17,942
Say, what is this
"isn't " and " is she"?

1058
01:02:18,016 --> 01:02:19,194
My dear fellow,
if you'll allow me,

1059
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:21,533
let us take " isn't "
and " is she. "

1060
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,317
" Is" is that we both know,
I hope, is a verb.

1061
01:02:24,383 --> 01:02:26,969
" It" is a neuter gender,
and she is the feminine.

1062
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,269
Thus, we have the neuter and
the feminine, but no masculine.

1063
01:02:30,336 --> 01:02:33,019
" What? No masculine,"
you say, then I say...

1064
01:02:33,088 --> 01:02:34,364
" I'm nuts,"
that's what you say.

1065
01:02:34,432 --> 01:02:35,959
Yeah, that's right,
you're nuts!

1066
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:37,723
She's in love
with you, Jack.

1067
01:02:37,792 --> 01:02:39,614
In love? Who?
June.

1068
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,792
Are you crazy?

1069
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:41,846
No, no, that's already
been settled.

1070
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,032
You're the one
who's crazy.

1071
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:46,104
Why, she's been goo-gooing,
gee-geeing all over you

1072
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:47,485
ever since
we started the camp.

1073
01:02:47,552 --> 01:02:49,243
Don't talk nonsense.

1074
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:52,061
In love. Why, she only came
down to camp to bring Buddie.

1075
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:53,622
In love with me.
You're an idiot.

1076
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,037
I hope so.

1077
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,050
I sincerely hope so.

1078
01:03:04,064 --> 01:03:05,820
The camp, Thurber.
It's on fire!

1079
01:04:02,207 --> 01:04:03,963
A bunch of fellows came over
the hill carrying torches.

1080
01:04:04,031 --> 01:04:05,242
The fellow leading
him was a-shooting.

1081
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:06,457
The Falins.

1082
01:04:06,528 --> 01:04:08,350
Well... Never mind, we'll
talk about that later.

1083
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:09,725
I'll get the stock
out of the corral.

1084
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:12,344
You get the instruments
and maps out of there.

1085
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:13,021
So that's how
you want it, is it?

1086
01:05:13,888 --> 01:05:16,987
All right, you skulking
coyotes, I'll play your game.

1087
01:05:17,056 --> 01:05:19,095
They're not gonna let me...

1088
01:05:19,967 --> 01:05:23,644
I'll put this road through if I have to
use your dirty rotten bodies for ties.

1089
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,022
I'll do it if I have to hire every
man in Gaptown to finish the job.

1090
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,161
If you could have seen it

1091
01:05:55,231 --> 01:05:57,141
I know you would have split your sides a
- laughing.

1092
01:05:57,215 --> 01:06:00,827
I was sitting there mending, and I
hear the dripping and the sizzling,

1093
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:03,284
and I says to myself,
I says, " I bet a rooster

1094
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,215
" it's the soft soap
a- boiling over. "

1095
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,262
And sure enough...

1096
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:08,921
Better try some of these
dandelion greens, son.

1097
01:06:08,991 --> 01:06:11,708
Zeke Denker fetched
them over this morning.

1098
01:06:11,776 --> 01:06:12,758
I ain't hungry.

1099
01:06:12,831 --> 01:06:14,293
But, David, you gotta eat something

1100
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:16,156
after all the plowing
you've done.

1101
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:17,720
Pappy.

1102
01:06:18,464 --> 01:06:21,595
A is the first letter
in the alphabet.

1103
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:25,688
Because it means
"And" " Apple" and " Ax. "

1104
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,868
What's this one, Pappy?

1105
01:06:31,936 --> 01:06:33,528
You mean this one?

1106
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,807
Offhand I'd say
it's alike an ox yoke.

1107
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,822
Didn't Mr. Hale tell you?

1108
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,004
He told me
but I forgot.

1109
01:06:43,072 --> 01:06:45,690
It ain't like
no Tolliver to forget.

1110
01:06:45,759 --> 01:06:47,963
Now, if I would
have been told...

1111
01:06:49,536 --> 01:06:51,324
You know what that is?

1112
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,004
Yeah.

1113
01:06:54,655 --> 01:06:56,216
Civilization!

1114
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,427
David, you oughtn't
to have done that!

1115
01:07:02,495 --> 01:07:03,706
I'm through pretending.

1116
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:05,401
Like you've been doing
all of last month.

1117
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:06,551
Saying things
you didn't mean.

1118
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,670
I'm getting sick
of the whole thing.

1119
01:07:07,743 --> 01:07:10,645
Now, son, look, you
gotta keep your shirt on.

1120
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,199
If it's June you're worrying
about, she'll be back pretty short.

1121
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:15,286
No, she ain't.

1122
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,499
She ain't never coming back.
Not the June I know.

1123
01:07:17,568 --> 01:07:19,390
Ain't nothing gonna
be the way it was.

1124
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:21,944
Look at Buddie,
even he's different.

1125
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,897
So are you.
Me?

1126
01:07:23,967 --> 01:07:25,178
Yes, you are.

1127
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:27,669
Them new fangled machines
down in Ticopi that's doing it.

1128
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,085
Every day you traipse
down there with Buddie

1129
01:07:29,152 --> 01:07:30,461
and you come back
being different.

1130
01:07:30,527 --> 01:07:32,087
Half the time
you're feeling glad.

1131
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:34,396
Like last week, they
tore up one of our fields.

1132
01:07:34,463 --> 01:07:36,983
Them machines don't care who's
been plowing there for 50 years.

1133
01:07:37,055 --> 01:07:38,943
The Tollivers don't
mean nothing to them.

1134
01:07:39,008 --> 01:07:40,699
I ain't nobody
with a high temper.

1135
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:42,426
But you're talking
unreasonable.

1136
01:07:42,496 --> 01:07:43,870
We're getting rich,
ain't we?

1137
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,139
Look at them five checks
over there in that bowI.

1138
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:47,320
Half of them is yours.

1139
01:07:47,392 --> 01:07:50,141
And how did we get them?
Just doing nothing.

1140
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:53,207
And if that's what you call
civilization, then I'm for it.

1141
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:55,483
Judd!
He needs a-talking to.

1142
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:57,526
It ain't right for no young
man to brood about nothing.

1143
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,388
This you call
nothing, huh?

1144
01:07:59,456 --> 01:08:00,917
Listen, there's got to
be a change, you see?

1145
01:08:00,991 --> 01:08:02,201
Not for me,
there ain't.

1146
01:08:02,271 --> 01:08:03,351
There ain't no more
chance of me changing

1147
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:05,594
than there is of that old Lonesome
Pine changed into a hickory.

1148
01:08:05,663 --> 01:08:07,671
I belong to the earth.
The plowed up soiI.

1149
01:08:07,744 --> 01:08:09,532
I was raised and
I'm gonna die in it.

1150
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,006
You got what you like?
You can have it.

1151
01:08:11,071 --> 01:08:14,071
Me, I'm going back. Back
where my pappy raised me.

1152
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,268
David, you can't
do that.

1153
01:08:18,335 --> 01:08:21,117
You're our boy.
I mean, you're like our boy.

1154
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:23,093
I ain't a-wanting
you to go.

1155
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,014
Two pink-eyed doves
sitting in a tree,

1156
01:08:30,432 --> 01:08:32,766
one for you, one for me.

1157
01:08:32,831 --> 01:08:34,108
For June.

1158
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,982
<i>For when
it's twilight on the trail</i>

1159
01:09:05,952 --> 01:09:09,334
<i>And I jog along</i>

1160
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:13,980
<i>The world is like a dream</i>

1161
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:17,435
<i>And the ripple
of the stream</i>

1162
01:09:18,784 --> 01:09:21,598
<i>Is my song</i>

1163
01:09:22,528 --> 01:09:27,710
<i>For when it's twilight
on the trail</i>

1164
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:45,624
Hello?

1165
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,564
Well, well, well,
Miss Tolliver.

1166
01:09:50,016 --> 01:09:51,063
What, again?

1167
01:09:51,136 --> 01:09:52,118
Obviously.

1168
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:54,199
Do I tell her
you're out to tea?

1169
01:09:54,271 --> 01:09:56,126
No, I'll talk to her.

1170
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,978
You'd better go out and check
with Marks about those uprights.

1171
01:10:02,048 --> 01:10:03,324
Naturally.

1172
01:10:04,639 --> 01:10:05,817
Hello, June.

1173
01:10:05,888 --> 01:10:08,222
Are you mad at somebody
or something?

1174
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,109
Well, you talk like it.

1175
01:10:11,488 --> 01:10:12,698
Oh, yeah.

1176
01:10:13,887 --> 01:10:16,026
Busy? You don't know
what busy means.

1177
01:10:16,096 --> 01:10:17,306
I ain't...

1178
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:19,993
I mean, I haven't
had a minute to myself.

1179
01:10:20,543 --> 01:10:23,063
This morning I learnt
all about the Revolution.

1180
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:25,023
It was just like a feud.

1181
01:10:25,631 --> 01:10:27,060
In 1775...

1182
01:10:28,447 --> 01:10:30,520
Wait a minute, June.
Come in.

1183
01:10:30,623 --> 01:10:32,347
Mr. Hale, we've got that slue banked.

1184
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:33,626
That's fine, Taylor.

1185
01:10:33,695 --> 01:10:35,768
Wait a minute, get the steam
shoveI out on the bridge

1186
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,301
so we can start to
fill in the morning.

1187
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:38,749
Yes, sir.

1188
01:10:38,815 --> 01:10:40,222
Yeah, June?

1189
01:10:41,152 --> 01:10:42,199
Yeah.

1190
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:45,982
But that wasn't Patrick Henry,
that was Lord Cornwallis.

1191
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,288
Cornwallis.

1192
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:48,852
All right. Cornwallis.

1193
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:51,164
What difference
does it make?

1194
01:10:52,576 --> 01:10:53,852
How are you?

1195
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:57,820
How's Pappy and Mammy
and Buddie?

1196
01:10:58,784 --> 01:10:59,798
They are?

1197
01:10:59,871 --> 01:11:00,918
Yeah.

1198
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:11,225
Say, June, you know you've
got the prettiest eyes.

1199
01:11:12,031 --> 01:11:12,979
Yeah.

1200
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:15,994
And the cutest nose.

1201
01:11:18,848 --> 01:11:20,735
Say, have you
got a dimple?

1202
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:31,421
You get a fix, Son?

1203
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,462
She's all sort onto the
bridge and ready to go.

1204
01:11:33,535 --> 01:11:35,096
We'll pop her off
in the morning.

1205
01:11:35,168 --> 01:11:37,655
Kind of like to have
Mr. Hale see it.

1206
01:12:00,799 --> 01:12:02,141
Hey, Pappy.

1207
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,692
Now we're here
for Mr. Corsey?

1208
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,510
Yeah, but you stay right
here till your pappy

1209
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:10,363
gets through talking
to Mr. Hale.

1210
01:12:10,432 --> 01:12:11,806
Thanks, Pappy.

1211
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:30,557
Can I come in,
Mr. Hale?

1212
01:12:31,007 --> 01:12:32,600
Sure, come on in.

1213
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,886
I got serious things to
talk to you about, Mr. Hale.

1214
01:12:37,951 --> 01:12:38,900
Sit down.

1215
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:49,499
And now, it's Dave
that's going away.

1216
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:50,941
It's gotten me worried.

1217
01:12:51,008 --> 01:12:52,601
About Melissa, I mean.

1218
01:12:52,672 --> 01:12:54,711
She don't sing
no more, Mr. Hale.

1219
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,434
Sun up always seen
her singing, you know?

1220
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:59,892
I'm sorry about Melissa,
but there's nothing I can do.

1221
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:01,396
I got troubles of my own.

1222
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:03,293
You gotta come, Mr. Hale.

1223
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:05,693
Melissa,
she'll listen to you.

1224
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,865
Somehow, I don't talk
the right language to her.

1225
01:13:07,936 --> 01:13:10,172
No wonder you can't speak a
language which Melissa understands.

1226
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,246
I've never heard her favor
your feud to the Falins.

1227
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:14,392
Have you done anything to
stop it? No, you haven't.

1228
01:13:14,463 --> 01:13:15,575
You came down here
to blame me

1229
01:13:15,647 --> 01:13:17,273
for June's going away
and for Dave's leaving.

1230
01:13:17,343 --> 01:13:19,001
You'd like to
thrust the responsibility

1231
01:13:19,071 --> 01:13:20,664
for Melissa's suffering
on my shoulders.

1232
01:13:20,735 --> 01:13:23,637
Well, you don't do it. I've got enough
of you and your whole stupid outfit.

1233
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,124
I'm sorry, Judd, I...

1234
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,785
I didn't really mean
what I said.

1235
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:39,164
Sure glad.

1236
01:13:39,647 --> 01:13:42,778
I liked you the first day
you walked into my house.

1237
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:46,100
Wait a minute.

1238
01:13:47,935 --> 01:13:49,015
Hello?

1239
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,449
Yes, Hale speaking.

1240
01:13:51,903 --> 01:13:54,172
Louisville?
Just a minute.

1241
01:13:54,623 --> 01:13:56,532
You wanna
speak to June?

1242
01:13:57,439 --> 01:13:58,421
Can I?

1243
01:13:58,495 --> 01:13:59,542
Come here.

1244
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:02,229
<i>Hold that up to your ear.</i>

1245
01:14:06,367 --> 01:14:08,222
Now, talk right in here.

1246
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,755
What for?

1247
01:14:09,823 --> 01:14:11,733
Well, you wanna speak
to June, don't you?

1248
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:13,333
But you said
she was in Louisville.

1249
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,163
Well, that's where
she is.

1250
01:14:19,103 --> 01:14:20,630
<i>Hello, Pappy.</i>

1251
01:14:21,599 --> 01:14:22,647
June.

1252
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,789
Where are you hiding?

1253
01:14:25,855 --> 01:14:28,440
I'm not hiding, Pappy.
I'm in Louisville.

1254
01:14:30,751 --> 01:14:32,092
She says
she's in Louisville.

1255
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,915
Well, that's what
I told you.

1256
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,597
Is this thing hollow
all the way through?

1257
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,045
Yeah, all the way through.

1258
01:14:38,111 --> 01:14:39,224
Well...

1259
01:14:44,671 --> 01:14:46,013
Hello, little brush rabbit.

1260
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,106
You didn't, huh?

1261
01:15:17,087 --> 01:15:18,777
You know what your ma said
this morning?

1262
01:15:40,383 --> 01:15:41,560
Operator?

1263
01:15:45,951 --> 01:15:48,253
Buddie!
Buddie is in there.

1264
01:15:52,702 --> 01:15:53,815
Buddie.

1265
01:15:54,815 --> 01:15:55,993
Pappy.

1266
01:15:56,511 --> 01:15:57,558
Jack.

1267
01:15:58,111 --> 01:15:59,354
Pappy!

1268
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:06,581
Buddie! Buddie!

1269
01:16:08,959 --> 01:16:10,104
Buddie!

1270
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:22,485
Buddie. Buddie.

1271
01:16:23,422 --> 01:16:25,245
<i>Get me Dr. Owen, quick.</i>

1272
01:16:26,431 --> 01:16:28,220
Get me some hot water.

1273
01:16:33,471 --> 01:16:34,682
Buddie.

1274
01:16:37,375 --> 01:16:40,342
Son. It's your pappy, Son.

1275
01:16:40,927 --> 01:16:42,869
Oh, God,
don't let him die.

1276
01:16:43,582 --> 01:16:46,004
Don't take him away
from my poor Melissa.

1277
01:16:48,607 --> 01:16:49,883
Buddie.

1278
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:53,432
<i>Buddie.</i>

1279
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:40,439
You may be the civiI law
around here, but get this,

1280
01:17:40,511 --> 01:17:42,682
interference with the public
carriers, the railroad, I mean,

1281
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,157
that's a federaI offense.

1282
01:17:44,223 --> 01:17:45,597
It might have been
an accident.

1283
01:17:45,663 --> 01:17:47,518
But it wasn't!

1284
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:48,827
It was cold wanton murder!

1285
01:17:48,895 --> 01:17:51,677
They killed little Buddie!
They murdered him! A baby!

1286
01:17:51,742 --> 01:17:53,433
And I'm gonna put them
where they rot.

1287
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:55,608
Not for a murder, your
heels are too smart for that.

1288
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,134
And there's not a man in this town
with courage enough to convict him.

1289
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:00,312
But you're gonna make out
a warrant on my charges!

1290
01:18:00,382 --> 01:18:01,659
You're gonna do what I say.

1291
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,582
And you're gonna do
everything I say.

1292
01:18:03,647 --> 01:18:07,324
Mr. Hale, I've lived in this
country for more than 50 years.

1293
01:18:07,743 --> 01:18:10,460
I was born here,
and I know these people.

1294
01:18:10,815 --> 01:18:13,881
I can bring the Falins
to court. Maybe hang them.

1295
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:16,697
But that don't stop feuds.
It makes them.

1296
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:20,053
There'd be killings like
we've never seen before.

1297
01:18:20,223 --> 01:18:22,940
Mountain people don't
seem to like law, Mr. Hale.

1298
01:18:23,007 --> 01:18:25,854
Down here, peace has
got to come from within.

1299
01:18:26,687 --> 01:18:29,021
It all seems kind of brutaI and
primitive while it's a-boiling,

1300
01:18:29,086 --> 01:18:32,086
but, well, I was born here and I know.

1301
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:35,226
I'm talking honest,
Mr. Hale.

1302
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,335
You know, I...

1303
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:40,189
I cried when they told me
Buddie was killed.

1304
01:18:40,447 --> 01:18:42,008
Why, I used to ride miles
out of my way

1305
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:43,867
to fetch him
some stick candy.

1306
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,078
But I like Jim Falin, too.

1307
01:18:46,687 --> 01:18:48,792
That was before
you come here.

1308
01:18:48,863 --> 01:18:51,645
He's older than Buddie
but just a kid.

1309
01:18:52,095 --> 01:18:53,950
Eyes always a-laughing.

1310
01:18:54,175 --> 01:18:56,182
He was
Buck's favorite son.

1311
01:18:57,055 --> 01:18:58,877
Dave Tolliver shot him.

1312
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:00,922
Had reasons, I guess.

1313
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:02,805
Or I could have
cramped him in jaiI.

1314
01:19:02,879 --> 01:19:04,537
Yes, I could.

1315
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:08,501
But did you ever get up close to
Melissa and look into her eyes?

1316
01:19:08,575 --> 01:19:09,655
Well, you do that
sometime.

1317
01:19:09,727 --> 01:19:11,549
Then you tell me
what kind of a law

1318
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,103
you can think of
that will correct it.

1319
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,148
Tell me...
June!

1320
01:19:25,215 --> 01:19:27,703
He couldn't just die,
could he?

1321
01:19:28,702 --> 01:19:30,393
He had to be killed.

1322
01:19:31,103 --> 01:19:32,859
Killed by the Falin.

1323
01:19:32,927 --> 01:19:34,356
They did that.

1324
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,826
He was my only brother.

1325
01:19:36,894 --> 01:19:38,553
And they killed him.

1326
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:42,681
He ran down the hill with
me before I went away.

1327
01:19:43,006 --> 01:19:45,625
He stood up there
at the Lonesome Pine.

1328
01:19:46,271 --> 01:19:48,376
I never got to
see him again.

1329
01:19:49,663 --> 01:19:52,030
I'm never going to
see him again.

1330
01:19:53,759 --> 01:19:55,221
What are you doing here?

1331
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:57,433
Why aren't you up there
with Dave and Daddy?

1332
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,091
You loved Buddie,
didn't you?

1333
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,981
You said you loved him.

1334
01:20:03,262 --> 01:20:04,986
He was gonna be an engineer.

1335
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:06,745
Like you and Corsey.

1336
01:20:08,799 --> 01:20:11,548
When I tucked him in
at night, he said,

1337
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:17,655
" A is for apple, and I'll bet
you I'll be as big as Mr. Hale. "

1338
01:20:18,782 --> 01:20:19,960
What are you doing here?

1339
01:20:20,031 --> 01:20:21,078
June.

1340
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:23,642
You're down here
with the law!

1341
01:20:23,743 --> 01:20:25,466
The law's gonna help you!

1342
01:20:25,598 --> 01:20:27,987
The laws gonna show you
how it don't hurt.

1343
01:20:28,063 --> 01:20:29,972
When somebody you love...

1344
01:20:30,046 --> 01:20:31,061
When somebody you love...

1345
01:20:31,135 --> 01:20:32,083
Oh, June, darling,
don't cry.

1346
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:34,745
You mustn't cry.
Listen to me, dear.

1347
01:20:34,815 --> 01:20:36,408
I love you, and...

1348
01:20:38,846 --> 01:20:40,123
You love me?

1349
01:20:41,118 --> 01:20:43,060
You said
you loved Buddie.

1350
01:20:43,742 --> 01:20:45,652
Why aren't you
with Buddie?

1351
01:20:45,727 --> 01:20:47,963
Why aren't you
where they need you?

1352
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:49,852
You're here
with the law.

1353
01:20:49,919 --> 01:20:50,998
You don't love me!

1354
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:52,980
Well, I do
with all of my heart.

1355
01:20:53,055 --> 01:20:56,732
You never said you love me before
and I was hungry to hear it.

1356
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:59,579
You said
you love Buddie.

1357
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:01,752
But you ain't
doing nothing about it!

1358
01:21:01,822 --> 01:21:04,343
You ain't fighting!
You ain't killing!

1359
01:21:04,414 --> 01:21:07,164
That's what's coming
to them! The Falins!

1360
01:21:10,143 --> 01:21:11,998
This is what you wanted
me to be, ain't it?

1361
01:21:12,063 --> 01:21:14,267
Pretty, nice words,
hollow words!

1362
01:21:14,718 --> 01:21:16,147
I don't want it!

1363
01:21:16,222 --> 01:21:18,459
I don't want you!
I don't want anything!

1364
01:21:18,527 --> 01:21:20,414
I don't want anything
but the Falins!

1365
01:21:46,975 --> 01:21:50,270
Our Father who art in
Heaven, hallowed be thy name.

1366
01:21:50,686 --> 01:21:53,785
Thy Kingdom come. Thy
will be done on earth

1367
01:21:53,855 --> 01:21:55,480
as it is in Heaven.

1368
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:59,063
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

1369
01:21:59,134 --> 01:22:01,917
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1370
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:06,941
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from eviI.

1371
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:11,446
For thine is the power and
the glory forever and ever.

1372
01:22:12,351 --> 01:22:13,431
Amen.

1373
01:22:24,063 --> 01:22:30,205
<i>When it's twilight on the trail</i>

1374
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:35,416
<i>And I rest once more</i>

1375
01:22:37,726 --> 01:22:40,792
<i>My ceiling is the sky</i>

1376
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:43,830
<i>And the grass</i>

1377
01:22:45,183 --> 01:22:47,484
<i>On which I lie</i>

1378
01:22:48,094 --> 01:22:50,680
<i>Is my floor</i>

1379
01:22:53,727 --> 01:23:00,088
<i>When it's twilight on the trail</i>

1380
01:23:02,559 --> 01:23:06,137
<i>And my voice is still</i>

1381
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:12,819
<i>Please plant
this heart of mine</i>

1382
01:23:12,894 --> 01:23:16,855
<i>Underneath the Lonesome Pine</i>

1383
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:22,490
<i>On the hill</i>

1384
01:23:30,815 --> 01:23:35,070
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father, we
bow before thee in meekest humbleness

1385
01:23:35,775 --> 01:23:40,631
leaving in thy divine wisdom and
accepting with equaI humbleness

1386
01:23:41,086 --> 01:23:43,225
the complexities
of this life.

1387
01:23:44,126 --> 01:23:48,436
We are returning to the earth
that which thou has produced.

1388
01:23:49,086 --> 01:23:52,534
A part of thy souI,
of life eternaI.

1389
01:24:37,503 --> 01:24:40,372
There's just about
eight of them, Judd.

1390
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:41,948
Dominickers!

1391
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:44,729
Looks like things is just
born to the Tollivers.

1392
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:46,391
Don't it, Melissa?

1393
01:24:46,911 --> 01:24:48,438
Sure seems.

1394
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:50,940
What are we
going to do?

1395
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:52,381
What are we
standing here for?

1396
01:24:52,446 --> 01:24:53,788
June, honey.

1397
01:24:53,854 --> 01:24:56,026
I'm not just gonna
stand around any longer.

1398
01:24:56,095 --> 01:24:57,436
Be sensible.

1399
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:07,482
Before green-up
time, Dave.

1400
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,306
That's what you want,
isn't it?

1401
01:25:13,791 --> 01:25:14,903
You mean it?

1402
01:25:14,974 --> 01:25:18,171
It's gotta be somebody
who acts like a Tolliver.

1403
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,410
Is that what
it's going to be?

1404
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:33,339
Dave, I don't
want you to go.

1405
01:25:33,406 --> 01:25:36,024
I ain't hating the Falins.
I ain't hating nobody.

1406
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:37,687
I ain't grieving
for Buddie.

1407
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,646
June's my sorrow now.

1408
01:25:39,711 --> 01:25:41,718
I don't want to
go on hating.

1409
01:25:42,046 --> 01:25:43,606
Don't go, David.

1410
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:46,905
Dave...
Wait a minute.

1411
01:25:47,839 --> 01:25:49,627
Dave, you're not going to
let him... Dave, listen.

1412
01:25:49,694 --> 01:25:52,760
You can't do this thing. You've
got green-up time to think about.

1413
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:54,619
You'll be
getting married, then.

1414
01:25:54,686 --> 01:25:56,923
Now you're going out and
run the risk of being killed.

1415
01:25:56,991 --> 01:25:58,518
Hasn't there been enough
unhappiness in this house?

1416
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:59,572
You ain't a Tolliver.

1417
01:25:59,646 --> 01:26:00,595
You're an outsider.

1418
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:02,100
Yes. Well, none of you could have

1419
01:26:02,174 --> 01:26:04,029
loved little Buddie
any better than I did.

1420
01:26:04,094 --> 01:26:06,877
And he was killed because I taught
him to love the things I did.

1421
01:26:06,943 --> 01:26:08,437
It was my fault.

1422
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:11,194
And this matter of getting
even is gonna be my business.

1423
01:26:11,262 --> 01:26:13,335
It's gonna be my business untiI
I've cleaned out every Falin

1424
01:26:13,407 --> 01:26:15,643
that had anything
to do with it.

1425
01:26:19,454 --> 01:26:21,243
Jack! Jack!

1426
01:26:34,271 --> 01:26:35,383
Dave.

1427
01:26:36,030 --> 01:26:37,459
I didn't want him to go.

1428
01:26:37,534 --> 01:26:39,356
I wouldn't have
let you go, either.

1429
01:26:39,839 --> 01:26:41,781
I would have
stopped you.

1430
01:26:43,423 --> 01:26:46,554
I only said those things
'cause I was hurt inside.

1431
01:26:48,094 --> 01:26:49,785
I could've stopped you.

1432
01:26:49,854 --> 01:26:51,512
But he's different.

1433
01:26:51,582 --> 01:26:53,437
He's not like a brother.

1434
01:26:54,687 --> 01:26:56,443
He'll never come back.

1435
01:26:57,438 --> 01:26:59,609
He'll never
wanna come back.

1436
01:27:01,598 --> 01:27:02,711
Dave.

1437
01:27:03,966 --> 01:27:05,428
Stop him.

1438
01:27:05,503 --> 01:27:07,291
Tell him what I can't.

1439
01:27:09,247 --> 01:27:10,654
Please, Dave.

1440
01:27:31,582 --> 01:27:32,826
You ain't going
to no Falins.

1441
01:27:32,895 --> 01:27:35,000
No? Well,
you try and stop me.

1442
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:38,518
You're looking for trouble, Mr.
Hale, the mountains is full of it.

1443
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:11,737
We're all brave men.

1444
01:28:12,095 --> 01:28:14,200
Falins are brave men.

1445
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:15,702
You killed
the children.

1446
01:28:15,774 --> 01:28:17,433
I didn't know.

1447
01:28:17,503 --> 01:28:18,932
It's done now.

1448
01:28:19,454 --> 01:28:21,821
Sometime,
I'll wanna go downtown.

1449
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:24,180
People, they'll look at me.

1450
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:28,442
Maybe when I ain't around,
they'll call me Herod.

1451
01:28:29,598 --> 01:28:31,060
Herod Falin.

1452
01:28:31,998 --> 01:28:33,940
They might call me that.

1453
01:28:34,366 --> 01:28:36,374
He was a fellow
that done that once.

1454
01:28:36,446 --> 01:28:37,690
He killed babies.

1455
01:28:37,758 --> 01:28:39,482
The kid was a Tolliver,
wasn't he?

1456
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:41,273
You're kind of forgetting
about Jim, ain't you?

1457
01:28:41,342 --> 01:28:42,935
I ain't
forgetting nothing.

1458
01:28:43,006 --> 01:28:45,908
Jim told me, in my arms, he
was hiding behind the bushes

1459
01:28:45,982 --> 01:28:47,706
trying to pick off
Dave Tolliver,

1460
01:28:47,775 --> 01:28:50,295
and Dave couldn't see
who he was shooting at.

1461
01:28:50,366 --> 01:28:52,700
Buddie Tolliver
couldn't say that.

1462
01:28:53,854 --> 01:28:56,025
I don't like him and
I ain't gonna like him.

1463
01:28:56,094 --> 01:28:58,069
I get my hands
on that Dave Tolliver...

1464
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:03,607
Who's that?

1465
01:29:03,678 --> 01:29:05,107
Dave Tolliver.

1466
01:29:12,542 --> 01:29:14,036
What are you here for?

1467
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:15,484
I wanna talk to you.

1468
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:17,460
And I ain't carry no gun.

1469
01:29:28,766 --> 01:29:30,108
Come on in.

1470
01:29:38,751 --> 01:29:42,711
If I tell you... If I tell you
we're licked, will you stop fighting?

1471
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,187
Who's licked?

1472
01:29:44,382 --> 01:29:46,073
Who do you mean?
Me.

1473
01:29:47,358 --> 01:29:49,016
You ain't licked.

1474
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:51,485
You couldn't be licked.

1475
01:29:52,606 --> 01:29:54,428
Why did you come here?

1476
01:29:54,558 --> 01:29:56,020
Why?
Yeah.

1477
01:29:56,798 --> 01:29:58,936
Why shouldn't
I come to you?

1478
01:29:59,006 --> 01:30:01,014
I ought to have dragged myself
through all the brambles,

1479
01:30:01,087 --> 01:30:02,428
all the way from here
up to your house,

1480
01:30:02,494 --> 01:30:05,942
and say, " I'm sorry. "

1481
01:30:07,582 --> 01:30:10,779
But I just ain't
got the sand.

1482
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:13,052
You ain't my father.

1483
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,906
You're a sniveling pup!

1484
01:30:14,974 --> 01:30:16,698
I've been like that.

1485
01:30:18,975 --> 01:30:21,146
Maybe that's what's
the trouble.

1486
01:30:22,014 --> 01:30:23,705
You wanna shake hands?

1487
01:30:28,062 --> 01:30:31,062
Now, tell me,
why did you do it?

1488
01:30:37,374 --> 01:30:39,512
It was Aunt Melissa's
birthday...

1489
01:31:11,646 --> 01:31:14,329
For a minute
I thought you meant it.

1490
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:25,565
I did. I did!

1491
01:32:01,502 --> 01:32:03,192
Dave, what happened?

1492
01:32:05,726 --> 01:32:07,352
I fell on my gun.

1493
01:32:09,854 --> 01:32:11,763
Buck Falin was passing.

1494
01:32:11,838 --> 01:32:14,805
He was good enough
to fetch me home.

1495
01:32:28,446 --> 01:32:29,722
Dave.

1496
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:34,999
If you don't mind,
can I...

1497
01:32:36,222 --> 01:32:38,010
Can I stay till...

1498
01:32:39,294 --> 01:32:40,668
Sure.

1499
01:32:48,414 --> 01:32:50,137
It's of no use, Jack.

1500
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:52,853
You can't
cut this enough.

1501
01:32:54,526 --> 01:32:55,639
Dave.

1502
01:32:56,638 --> 01:32:57,685
Dave?

1503
01:32:58,206 --> 01:32:59,831
It'll soon be green-up.

1504
01:32:59,901 --> 01:33:01,941
And you'll have the biggest
wedding in the whole country.

1505
01:33:02,014 --> 01:33:03,192
Won't he, June?

1506
01:33:09,982 --> 01:33:11,924
In the spring, David.

1507
01:33:24,126 --> 01:33:25,500
One for you,

1508
01:33:28,318 --> 01:33:29,528
one for me.

1509
01:33:31,774 --> 01:33:33,465
Biggest wedding in...

1510
01:33:48,382 --> 01:33:54,525
<i>When it's twilight
on the trail</i>

1511
01:33:55,006 --> 01:33:59,196
<i>And my voice is still</i>

1512
01:33:59,262 --> 01:34:03,037
<i>Please plant
this heart of mine</i>

1513
01:34:03,102 --> 01:34:07,357
<i>Underneath that Lonesome Pine</i>

1514
01:34:07,422 --> 01:34:10,771
<i>On the hill</i>
