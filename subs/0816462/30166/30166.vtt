That's... That's our cousins.

184
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,630
Our cousins.

185
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,090
Our cousins, our cousins.

186
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,970
One more time
for the Five Heartbeats.

187
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,700
Come on, give it up. Whoo!

188
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,390
Let me get
all the contestants up.

189
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,270
Come on up.
We have a winner.

190
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,610
We have a winner.

191
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,210
We have a winner.

192
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,150
"Flash and the Ebony Sparks"!

193
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,540
Yeah!

194
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
My brother would like to meet you.

195
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,900
Why doesn't he come over?

196
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,290
Because he's shy.

197
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,220
Look at his face.
Don't he look shy?

198
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,070
Yeah, but who's that girl
he's sitting with?

199
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,680
That's our sister.

200
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,400
See? Look how shy he is.

201
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,690
So can l get your phone number

202
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,020
so he can call you sometime?

203
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,820
OK. 555...

204
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,490
Excuse me. l don't mean
to disturb anybody,

205
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,920
but my name is Jimmy Potter.

206
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,530
l just want to say

207
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,510
l really enjoyed the show tonight.

208
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,410
l especially liked that opening.

209
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,540
Shy brother works every time.

210
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,520
You looked like you
were running for your life.

211
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,880
l don't quite know
where to begin this,

212
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,910
but l was wondering

213
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,430
if you fellas could
use a good manager.

214
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,930
See, l've managed
a lot of groups.

215
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,430
l think you guys
have what it takes

216
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,360
to go all the way to the top.

217
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,390
Now, you don't have
to sign anything.

218
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,340
Your word and your handshake
are good enough for me.

219
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,240
lf you give me just one month,

220
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,320
l guarantee
when you come back,

221
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,570
you'll win that talent contest.

222
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,450
Yeah? And if you don't win,

223
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,360
l'll give you the $100.

224
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,760
Man, l like them odds.

225
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,850
Well, then,
you just think about it.

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
And if you're ready,

227
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,800
l mean really ready,

228
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,970
you be at my house tomorrow night
at 7:00, all right?

229
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,760
Mr. Potter,
Eddie's supposed to be here.

230
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,050
l don't know where he at.

231
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,770
Stop apologizing for him,
Dresser.

232
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,770
Sit down. Call me Jimmy.

233
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,850
Yes, sir.

234
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,440
Ladies, next week,
we will work on posture

235
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,780
and also each individual
makeup base, OK?

236
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,030
l promise you, next week
is going to be more fun.

237
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,110
Okeydoke.

238
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,650
Bye-bye.

239
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,410
Hi.

240
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,490
Hi.

241
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,620
Come on, Tanya.

242
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,000
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,230
Bye-bye, Mr. Potter.

244
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,870
Bye, Tanya.

245
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,350
Jimmy, may l see you
for a second, please?

246
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,430
Jimmy, why are you doing this
to yourself again?

247
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,950
Eleanor,
l know what l'm doing, OK?

248
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,260
Tanya.

249
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,440
What's wrong?

250
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,720
What's wrong?
You know what's wrong.

251
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,430
l thought we agreed that
you would not do this.

252
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,440
l have such a good feeling
about these kids.

253
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,060
Aw, Jimmy,
you had such a good feeling

254
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,940
about the Brownsville Boys.

255
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,760
You had a great feeling
about the Four Clovers.

256
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,060
Great feeling about the Esquires.

257
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,330
And when they made it big,
what happened?

258
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,250
What happened?

259
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,580
They left you.

260
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,320
They left us.

261
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,600
They almost destroyed you.

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,880
They almost destroyed
our marriage.

263
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,210
l'm not going to
let that happen again.

264
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,590
All that other stuff
is behind us.

265
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,430
All l'm asking is
for you to believe in me,

266
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,810
just one last time.

267
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,270
This group coming up now,
you've seen them before.

268
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,640
The Five Heartbeats!

269
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,420
Come on.
Let's hear it for them!

270
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,590
80...

271
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,300
and $100.

272
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,870
That ain't right,
taking Mr. Potter's money.

273
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,330
Give it back.

274
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,330
Nah. Nah.
A deal's a deal, Dresser.

275
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,370
This is business.

276
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,800
Jimmy, l told you
this was going to happen.

277
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,130
Let's get out of here.

278
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,300
Good show, fellas.
Good show.

279
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,840
l got some good news.

280
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,370
The owner of the club wants
to sign you to a contract.

281
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,100
Contract?

282
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,080
- The owner?
- Yeah.

283
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,600
l don't know.

284
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,520
l think you might
have to take that up

285
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,950
with our new manager.

286
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah, that's right.

287
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,490
We'll be talking to you, man.

288
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,070
All right.

289
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,160
Oh, Jimmy.

290
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,980
Baby Doll.

291
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,960
Baby Doll!

292
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,580
Hi.

293
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,830
Hey.

294
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,920
lt's happening, babe.

295
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,590
lt's really happening.

296
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,980
Winning!

297
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,060
Hey, how you doing?

298
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,230
Where you been

299
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,700
coming back here this late?

300
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,200
l told you
he had a show tonight.

301
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,530
How'd it go?

302
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,830
Good.

303
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,000
He ain't gonna be shit neither.

304
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,430
He didn't say nothin'.

305
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,140
He ain't gotta say nothin'.

306
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,190
You ain't gonna be shit,
'cause l ain't shit.

307
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,110
Hmm?

308
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,280
Why you talk like that?

309
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,320
You act like you don't
even care for the boy.

310
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,510
Stella...

311
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,120
l care about that boy.

312
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,030
l just want him to be
a better man than me.

313
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,460
All right. Let me have
everybody in here.

314
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,470
Come on, Heartbeats,
let's go.

315
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,050
Gentlemen,

316
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,220
l got somebody
l want you to meet.

317
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,640
Sergeant Ernest Johnson,

318
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,270
one of my oldest and finest
buddies from the army.

319
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,810
He's here to help us
with the choreography.

320
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,980
What are you
talking about, Jim?

321
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,610
l do the choreography, man.

322
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,280
Dresser, he's not here
to take your place.

323
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,610
He's here to just help out.

324
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,900
What can he teach me?

325
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,280
lf you didn't like
what l was doing,

326
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,080
you could've come
and talk to me

327
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,790
instead of going behind my back,
bringing in some old drunk.

328
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,280
Stop right there!

329
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,750
Don't let your mouth
get you into something

330
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,630
your ass can't get you out of.

331
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,380
Anyway, let me see
your best combination.

332
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,670
Huh?

333
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,800
Huh, my ass. Let me see
your best combination.

334
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,930
Show him, Dresser.

335
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,060
Show him your stuff.

336
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,440
Ha ha ha.
All right, all right.

337
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,630
Cat, Daddy.

338
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,960
Ha ha ha.

339
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,330
Just as l thought.

340
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,220
That ain't shit.

341
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,920
Hold my cane.

342
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,560
Hold my cane.

343
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,260
Now pay attention,

344
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,940
and you might learn something.

345
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,040
Damn.

346
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,590
<i>[Sarge] All right, Girl Scouts,{\i}
<i>let me see you move.{\i}</i>

347
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,890
<i>Smooth hands.{\i}</i>

348
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,550
<i>That's what I want to see.{\i}</i>

349

00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:37,610

Now, take this.

755
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,160

that gold record.

Well, let's see it.

827
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,800
Now, first of all,

828
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,390
Big Red really believes
in you guys,

829
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,020
and we decided to change
the cover a little bit

830
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,050
because we see the big picture,

831
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:54,150
Negroes and white folks
buying this album.

832
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,030
l like that idea.

833
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,280
Let me explain, OK?

834
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,290
Everybody's going to know
who this group is.

835
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,620
We just felt that the picture

836
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,710
wasn't as important
as it was

837
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,880
that we succeed
in crossing over.

838
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,380
l want my boys' picture
back on this album cover!

839
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,630
- lt's too late.
- We'll see about that.

840
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,420
A lot of bull.

841
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,050
Why do we have to cross over?

842
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,540
Why are niggers always crossing
over something, huh?

843
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,390
What's the matter?

844
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,890
They can accept our music
as long as they can't see our faces?

845
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,890
Take it easy on the dude.
lt's Big Red's idea.

846
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,400
lt's a good one, too.

847
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
First we build a strong
crossover audience,

848
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,320
then we can come out strong.

849
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,860
That's bullshit,
and you know it.

850
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,360
Crossover's nothing
but a double-cross.

851
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,200
Once we lose our audience,
we'll never get them back.

852
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,030
Next thing you know,
they try to change our sound.

853
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:47,870
They'll have us sounding
like white boys.

854
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,580
White boys sound like niggers,

855
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,370
they're the ones
making all the money.

856
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:55,590
Tell me something, how come
they never cross over to us?

857
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,590
l never seen five niggers

858
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,380

album cover.

859
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,920
Let's keep our tempers here.

860
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,420
Now, come on.
This isn't a racial issue.

861
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,220
We all have to look
at the big picture.

862
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,720
Man, fuck the big picture

863
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,430
if they can't accept us
for who we are and what we look like.

864
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,890
Come on.
What are you doing, man?

865
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,720
What are you doing? What...

866
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,300
What you doing in the hallway?

867
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,300
Hmm. Choirboy got a girl
in the room.

868
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,260
Choirboy's got a girl
in the room?

869
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,140
Mm-hmm. Choirboy.

870
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,500
Dresser, where you going?

871
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,270

Tanya Sawyer.

1048
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,710
You remember me.

1049
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,520
Yeah.

1050
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:39,540
So, have you written
any poems lately?

1051
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,570
Um... No. l've...

1052
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:54,260
Um...

1053
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,610
You want to get out of here
and go somewhere and talk?

1054
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,990
Yeah.

1055
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:04,160
Let me tell my brother.
He's upstairs, and, uh...

1056
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,340
Just wait right here.

1057
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,160
No. See, l got a better one.

1058
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:13,890
How you keep an asshole
in suspense?

1059
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,240
Oh, you can talk now.

1060
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,090
Hey, how's it going?

1061
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:20,300
You're not leaving the party,
are you?

1062
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,630
No. l'm going to J.T.'s room.

1063
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,140
Listen to this one.

1064
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,310
There was this king
and he had three daughters.

1065
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,850
He told the princes of the land
that if you wanted my daughters...

1066
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:31,680
l need to talk to you, Big Red.

1067
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,150
Give me a minute.
Can't you see l'm talking?

1068
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,980
No! l need to talk
to you right now

1069
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,940
about my royalties

1070
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,820
and how you keep your books.

1071
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,450
My office hours are
from 9:00 to 5:00.

1072
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,160
Fuck your office hours!

1073
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,630
l need to talk to you
right now, motherfucker!

1074
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:57,060
Look at that!

1075
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,630
What are you doing, man?

1076
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,180
Excuse me, ladies.

1077
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,340
Excuse me.

1078
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,630
You don't talk back!

1079
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,350
Uhh! Aah!

1080
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,790
Huh?

1081
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,940
Aah!

1082
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,650
Open up the goddamn window!

1083
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,390
- No!
- Yeah!

1084
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,710
Don't do this, Red!

1085
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,050
Don't do this to me, Red!

1086
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:44,220
No! Aah!

1087
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,470
Hit him again!

1088
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,970
Aah! No!

1089
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:48,950
Help! No!

1090
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,600
What about my books?

1091
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,850
What you want to talk about?

1092
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:55,540
Nothing! Please!

1093
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:59,260
What you want to talk about?

1094
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:01,150
Let me up!

1095
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:03,680
Bring him up. Come on, boy.

1096
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:05,150
Bring him in.

1097
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:06,740
Come back here!

1098
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,380
Let me up!

1099
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:15,660
Now, if you have
any other problems

1100
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:19,340
with your royalties
and my books,

1101
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,780
my office hours are from...

1102
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,930
My office hours are from...

1103
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,950
9:00 to 5:00.

1104
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,520
You know, something's wrong.

1105
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,020
You're sitting by yourself,

1106
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,850
there's a big party
going on upstairs for us.

1107
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,980
All the ladies
are asking about you.

1108
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,610
They don't care nothing
about me.

1109
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:45,430
They just want to be seen
with J.T. of the Heartbeats.

1110
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:48,070
J.T., that's always
been part of your rap.

1111
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,700
"Hello. l'm J.T. of the
Five Heartbeats. How ya doin'?"

1112
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,450
Yeah, l know, l know,
but l'm tired of that.

1113
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,290
l'm getting older, Duck.

1114
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:59,210
l don't want to be some old man
still chasing.

1115
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:02,710
l'm tired of being with
different women every night.

1116
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:04,880
lt's like it's a drug,

1117
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,910
and l don't get nothing
out of it.

1118
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,980
Settle down,

1119
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:13,220
have some little kids
running around the house...

1120
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,260
No. l can't do that.

1121
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,690
lt's like l don't know
what it is.

1122
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:23,190
l like being with different women
all the time.

1123
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,690
lt's like l can't control myself.

1124
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,880
lt's like l'm addicted.

1125
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,280
l don't know what to say.

1126
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,410
l mean, they got centers

1127
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,830
for drug addicts and alcoholics,

1128
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,200
but l don't know

1129
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,870
if they have any
dick-control centers.

1130
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,000
l'm serious, Duck.

1131
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,330
l'm serious too. You should go
to a dick-control center.

1132
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,400
"l'm J.T. Matthews,"

1133
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,350
"and l can't control my dick."

1134
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,510
Oh, man.

1135
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,720
What they going to do
to it, though?

1136
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,230
You just work
with some mannequins.

1137
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,730
J.T., it's like this, man...

1138
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,140
When the right woman
comes along,

1139
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,530
it's going to be right.

1140
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:05,940
You can't force it.

1141
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,270
Yeah. l know. You're right.

1142
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,120
This would make a great song.

1143
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:17,100
Yeah, yeah.

1144
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,840
When you have one
of those crumb snatchers,

1145
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,920
just name one after me, okay?

1146
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,300
Whoever gets married first.

1147
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,560
l'll see you upstairs.

1148
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,440
Jimmy!

1149
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:51,780
Man, what's so important

1150
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,450
it couldn't wait
until tomorrow?

1151
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:54,660
Eleanor's mad as hell.

1152
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,280
We had plans today.

1153
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,360
This ain't going
to take that long.

1154
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:06,770
Ha ha ha ha!

1155
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,590
Well...

1156
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,650
Hey, Eddie!

1157
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,380
Jimmy.

1158
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,060
l wanted to talk to you,

1159
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,900
because l think
it's time for some changes.

1160
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,980
You've done a great job
with the boys,

1161
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:29,070
but now l think it's time

1162
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:33,090
for the boys to have
a more experienced manager.

1163
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,740
What's the joke, man?

1164
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:36,620
lt's not a joke.

1165
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,540
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

1166
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,620
l'm talking about buying you out.

1167
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:45,350
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1168
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,690
No.

1169
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:51,260
l have a contract on Eddie.

1170
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,840
Eddie, what the hell
is this all about?

1171
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:03,020
Jimmy, you know goddamn well

1172
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,550
what this is all about.

1173
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:07,440
Hey, baby...

1174
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:11,020
l don't need no manager
out there

1175
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,360
trying to replace me.

1176
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,200
You ain't out there

1177
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,320
singing and dancing every night.

1178
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:26,330
Jimmy, you don't do nothing
but get paid.

1179
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,630
Same old Big Red.

1180
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,260
You're not taking
the Heartbeats from me.

1181
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,220
Eddie is the Heartbeats.

1182
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:43,220
The other guys can be replaced
with anybody. You know that.

1183
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,270
Besides, the other guys
can't go anywhere

1184
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:47,690
until they've paid me
for the cars and clothes.

1185
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:50,400
l got an even longer list
of expenses,

1186
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,900
studio time, promotions,

1187
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,900
your expense account.

1188
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,570
So, you see,
you really owe me, Jimmy.

1189
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:58,450
You're trying to muscle me?

1190
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,740
As a friend,

1191
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,870
l am trying to put some money
into your pockets.

1192
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,370
Look, l'm not Bird!

1193
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:06,910
You can't dangle me out some window
and expect me to go away.

1194
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,820
l'll take your ass
to court first.

1195
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,170
l'll talk about
all the warehouses

1196
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:14,000
where you used to press
bootleg records of your own artists.

1197
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:15,630
Your two sets of accounting books,

1198
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:18,260
and a long list
of D.J.s taking payola.

1199
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,630
What kind of plans
did Eleanor make today?

1200
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,880
Eleanor...

1201
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:26,330
Eleanor.

1202
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,970
l really like Eleanor.

1203
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:41,820
Now, Red, this is
between you and me.

1204
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,670
Maybe.

1205
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,180
Jimmy.

1206
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,160
Who was that?

1207
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,090
Nobody.

1208
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,350
Jimmy.

1209
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:20,210
What's wrong?

1210
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,360
Nothing's wrong.

1211
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,910
Look, l'm going to
go down to the club

1212
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:28,280
and see if l can't sit in
for a few sets.

1213
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:02,900
Hello.

1214
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,120
<i>Tell Jimmy he can't hide.{\i}</i>

1215
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,800
Ha ha ha ha!

1216
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,370
Ha ha!

1217
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,200
<i>♪ I feel like going on ♪{\i}</i>

1218
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:47,160
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

1219
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,240
Get my car for me,
would you, Craig?

1220
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,780
l'll make the call.

1221
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,620
Jimmy!

1222
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,080

01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:30,810
l just want to say l love you,

1578
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:32,940
Brenda and Monica.

1579
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,980
Wow, huh? Heh heh.

1580
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:42,680
l really don't know what to say.

1581
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,400
l just know

1582
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,570
that l couldn't
have done anything

1583
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:51,370
without four of
the most talented, warm,

1584
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:54,910
giving brothers
on this entire planet.

1585
01:42:54,910 --> 01:42:58,440
They're the ones
that deserve this applause.

1586
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:04,420
These four gentlemen
opened their arms

1587
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:08,390
and embraced me
like l was a brother.

1588
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:11,930
That's why today is special.

1589
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:16,150
A very, very happy occasion
for me,

1590
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:20,160
as well as a sad one.

1591
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:22,230
Uh, it hurts me to announce

1592
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:24,470
that l'm leaving the group.

1593
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:29,770
l want to say thanks,
fellas, for everything.

1594
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:33,290
Uh, and thank you
for this gold album, A&B,

1595
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:35,250
and l hope
we have the same success

1596
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:36,750
on my new solo album,

1597
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,920
<i>Flash, It's Lonely at the Top,{\i}</i>

1598
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:40,290
which will be
in your record stores

1599
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:42,330
in about two weeks.

1600
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:46,630
Well, God bless all of you and

1601
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:48,020
thank you.

1602
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:56,060
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1603
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,810
You know, l thought
when l got this,

1604
01:44:01,810 --> 01:44:05,140
l'd feel on top of the world,
you know?

1605
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:11,950
Today l just feel...

1606
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:16,810
Uh...

1607
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:21,040
l was at a party once, and a, uh,

1608
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:24,800
music critic said,

1609
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,710
"Donald Matthews is going to be"

1610
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,140
"a great writer one day
when he suffers more."

1611
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:34,970
And l said to myself,
"What does that mean?"

1612
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:40,870
Now l know what it means.

1613
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,440
l'm on my way to becoming
a great writer,

1614
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:49,260
and l'd like to thank
two people in particular.

1615
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,250
My fiancée

1616
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,090
and my brother.

1617
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,300
My brother,

1618
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,710
who's always been the same

1619
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:11,470
selfish motherfucker
since we were kids.

1620
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:14,470
Don't do this here.
What you talking about?

1621
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:18,140
l hope l get a deal like Flash 'cause
today's my last day as a Heartbeat too.

1622
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:20,620
Duck, don't do this. Duck!

1623
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:27,500
Thank you very much.

1624
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:08,150

01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:45,080
How can any man say

1638
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,880
that he loves God

1639
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,950
whom he cannot see

1640
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:57,530
and not love his brothers

1641
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:00,240
who he sees daily?

1642
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,870
- Amen.
- Amen.

1643
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:04,790

- Love. True love.
- Yes, Lord.

1646
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,190
Unconditional love.

1647
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:18,100
For God so loved the world

1648
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:22,240
that He gave
His only begotten son

1649
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:27,360
so that we may have
life everlasting.

1650
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,440
This morning,

1651
01:47:31,190 --> 01:47:35,210
l want to reaffirm our faith

1652
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:40,150

1653
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:44,750
and ready to heal and mend

1654
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:47,120
confused hearts.

1655
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:48,620

- Eddie looks great, man.
- Oh, yeah. Praise God.

He's been with us four years now.

1690
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:44,590
Good. Look at you.

1691

Eddie King, Jr.!

1692
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:50,180
You'd be surprised
what a 12-step program

1693
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:52,430

will do for you.

01:51:05,150 --> 01:51:07,320
That's another... Another discussion.

1701
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:09,240
Let me rap to you a second.

1702
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:10,930
Excuse me.

1703
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:14,830
You know, uh,
l got this little group

1704
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:17,120
l'm managing now, you know.

1705
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:18,620
You managing a group?

1706
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:21,380
Yeah. The boys are bad, too.
They can warble.

1707
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:23,920
- Whoa.
- Yeah, just one little problem.

1708
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:26,500
We're having the damnedest...

1709
01:51:26,630 --> 01:51:29,560
We're having
the toughest time, uh,

1710
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:33,090
finding some
decent material, man.

1711
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:35,270
Enough said.

1712
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,400
Whatever you need.

1713
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:41,110
So we're in business, man?

1714
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:42,400
This is Duck.

1715
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:45,150
Duck? Duck, you think you
could churn me out an album?

1716
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,540
Ah!

1717
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,120
Hey, man, uh...

1718
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:57,750
l heard what went down
with you and J.T.

1719
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:59,710
l ain't got nothing
to say to J.T.

1720
01:51:59,710 --> 01:52:03,680
No, no, no. Duck, man.
Hear me out. Please, man.

1721
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:06,960
People make mistakes, you know.

1722
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:11,630
l know.

1723
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,950
l think maybe you should
give him a call.

1724
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:25,230
You just, uh, think about it,
all right?

1725
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:32,300
Yo, Pastor!

1726
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:34,490
You ready to blasta?

1727
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:36,430
Ha ha ha!

1728
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:41,890
Wings out, wings out,
wings out, wings out.

1729
01:52:44,710 --> 01:52:48,830
Now, how are you guys
supposed to fly like that, huh?

1730
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:51,860
Yeah.

1731
01:52:58,390 --> 01:53:00,670
Daddy, who's that?

1732
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:07,310
Y'all go play with your mama.

1733
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,700
Duck, you heard what Daddy said.

1734
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,880
Would you get over here, Duck?

1735
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:38,650
l feel stupid.

1736
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:43,230
Whoever has kids first.

1737
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:47,640
l missed you, Duck.

1738
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,440
Yo.

1739
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:55,870
Choirboy, what you doing
with the ribs?

1740
01:53:55,870 --> 01:53:57,370
You put...

1741
01:53:57,370 --> 01:53:58,990
- Charbroiled?
- Charbroiled?

1742
01:53:58,990 --> 01:54:00,680
Charcoaled.

1743
01:54:00,950 --> 01:54:02,580
Maybe you could manage us,

1744
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:04,870
'cause we gonna be hot.
Trust me.

1745
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,560
Tell him, Lester.

1746
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:09,670
All the other rappers
are in their 20s,

1747
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:11,710
but we're in our 40s.

1748
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:13,720
That's part of our hook.

1749
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:16,890
And the other part of our hook
is we rap

1750
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:21,200
- country and western.

They won't be watching Flash

That's junk. That's not music. l can't
have them listening to that stuff.

Show them what real music is.
