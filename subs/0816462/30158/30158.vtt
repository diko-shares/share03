1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,936
On the island of jamaica...

2
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:05,971
wow! Look at this place?

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:10,409
Swashbuckler henry morgan's
Pirate fortune.

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,744
Has been lost to history.

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,247
I don't understand why
Nobody is looking here.

6
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,752
This is where
Captain morgan was from.

7
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:22,721
Now, we're diving to the depths
Of a sunken city...

8
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,358
Gold coin?

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,428
And snaking our way
Through the limestone bedrock...

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,897
My god, It just keeps going.

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,765
On a hightech treasure hunt...

12
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,300
Dude, I'm seeing
Tons of stuff here.

13
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:38,570
To uncover the infamous
Morgan's millions...

14
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,105
Right there, right there.

15
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,373
"X" marks the spot.

16
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,576
Buried deep below
The earth's surface,

17
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:48,580
There are countless
Unsolved mysteries.

18
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,183
And today, we finally have
The tools to unlock them.

19
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,185
That's amazing.

20
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,587
It's super deep!

21
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,256
I'm rob nelson,
A scientist and explorer.

22
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,726
Investigating
Our planet's hidden depths.

23
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:04,529
- Getting deeper.
- Holy moly, stefan.

24
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,199
And helping me uncover
These subterranean secrets.

25
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,201
Is tech specialist stefan burns.

26
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,404
My god. Look at that!

27
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,140
Together...

28
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,742
I got something!

29
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,478
We are uncovering
New leads in our quest.

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,547
To solve earth's
Most enduring mysteries.

31
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,482
- There we go.
- Whoo!

32
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,419
These are the secrets
Of the underground.

35
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:35,960
Jamaica,
Land of turquoise waters.

36
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,630
And softsand beaches.

37
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,900
Stefan and I have come
To this tropical paradise.

38
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,902
In search of the vast riches.

39
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:47,439
Of one of the most
Infamous pirates of all time,

40
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,641
Henry morgan.

41
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,777
Captain morgan was
A welshborn mariner.

42
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,514
Who made a fortune raiding
Ships and settlements.

43
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:58,984
In the new world
In the late 17th century.

44
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:03,388
Starting in 1663,
Morgan led insurgent campaigns.

45
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,392
Against the world's mightiest
Military force at the time...

46
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,528
Spain.

47
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,530
The daring captain would attack
And plunder spanish colonies.

48
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,999
Throughout the caribbean.

49
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,668
And the americas,

50
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,338
Taking as many gold coins,
Silver bullion,

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,075
And precious gems
As he could find.

52
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,277
By the time of
His death in 1688,

53
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:30,682
He had captured a fortune worth
Millions in today's dollars.

54
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,620
Wow, Look at this place?

55
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,624
Can you imagine this place
Full of pirates?

56
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,627
While some of morgan's loot
Has been accounted for,

57
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,830
It's rumored that he made off
With untold riches.

58
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:49,234
After one of the most daring and
Successful raids of his career.

59
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,969
On panama city,

60
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:54,506
A wealthy enclave
On the spanish main.

61
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,243
In 2008, archeologists
Located a shipwreck.

62
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,313
Near the mouth
Of the chagres river,

63
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,716
The only waterway
That led to morgan's target.

64
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:09,521
The vessel was suspected to be
Morgan's flagship,<I> satisfaction.</I>

65
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,323
But, while there were
Cannons and chests,

66
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,396
The priceless spanish gold and
Silver was nowhere to be found.

67
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,464
Look at this huge cannon.

68
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,133
Wow!

69
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,867
You would not want to
Be on the receiving end.

70
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,002
Of one of these guys.

71
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,270
No, you would not.

72
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:28,073
This would spell
Destruction for sure.

73
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,075
So, we've come to jamaica,

74
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:33,345
The island morgan
Called home for decades,

75
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,879
In search of clues
That could lead us.

76
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,950
To the captain's rumored
Missing fortune.

77
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,953
What I don't understand
Is why nobody is looking here.

78
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,823
I mean, this is where
Captain morgan was from.

79
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:45,957
This is where He set up shop.

80
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,026
This is where all
The pirates were.

81
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,428
This seems The logical place.

82
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,297
Morgan's base of operations.

83
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,767
Was the once thriving city
Of port royal,

84
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,904
Then known as
"The wickedest place on earth."

85
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,509
Now a sleepy fishing village
Across the harbor from kingston,

86
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,446
300 years ago,
This fortified spit of land.

87
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,948
Was the place to be
For the pirates.

88
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,983
Operating in the caribbean.

89
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,921
After successful raids, pirates
Would descend on the city,

90
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:20,859
Eager to spend their loot,
Mostly on booze and women.

91
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,994
I don't know about you,
I've always, as a kid,

92
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,863
Really wanted to find
Pirate treasure.

93
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,132
I'm pretty sure every kid
Has always wanted.

94
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,400
To find pirate treasure.

95
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,268
With your geophysical Technology.

96
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,203
And the access that we have,

97
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,872
I think there's
A really good chance.

98
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,142
That we might actually
Find something.

99
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,879
So we head just offshore.

100
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:45,283
To the site we think holds
The most promise of loot...

101
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,953
The sunken portion
Of port royal.

102
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,022
So right now,
Just under the water,

103
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,959
We know there's basically
Part of port royal.

104
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:58,030
Just before noon
On june 7, 1692,

105
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:02,166
A catastrophic series
Of events struck this spot.

106
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:06,437
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake
Rocked the city,

107
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,374
Followed closely
By a giant tsunami.

108
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:13,845
And in a matter of moments,
2/3 of port royal sunk

109
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,916
40 feet into the sea,
Shops and taverns.

110
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,321
And all of their gold
And silver suddenly gone.

111
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,257
Could any of that still lie
Below the water.

112
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,125
In the sunken city?

113
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,195
Somebody did
Find gold here recently.

114
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,329
And that
They weren't using tech,

115
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,731
They just found it On the beach.

116
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,600
Using the tech that we have,
If we're lucky, we could scan.

117
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,935
Right over the top
Of some pirate treasure.

118
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,272
Overall, less than 10%
Of the underwater city.

119
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,008
Has been excavated,

120
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,012
Leaving more than 90% untouched
And ripe for exploration.

121
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,415
We've managed to secure access
To the site.

122
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,952
From the jamaican government,
A rare feat.

123
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:58,022
We'll be one of only a handful
Of teams to ever dive here.

124
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,625
All right, so we have
The sidescan sonar here.

125
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,960
Sweet!

126
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,963
We'll drop the sonar
Off the side of the boat.

127
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,998
It will scan the surface below.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,635
And help us map
The remnants of port royal.

129
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:14,038
Stefan will be able to use
This information to direct me.

130
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,575
Through an inmask comm system.

131
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,444
To spots that seem promising
To look for loot.

132
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,981
And I'll be able to do
My own scan of the seafloor.

133
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,385
This is my metal detector,
Fully waterproof.

134
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,653
Yeah, down to, Like, 90 feet,

135
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,322
Way more than
You'll be diving today.

136
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,523
That's awesome.

137
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,259
This will be able to detect
Any gold or silver.

138
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,660
Hidden in the ruins.

139
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:37,796
I'm guessing nobody's brought
A metal detector.

140
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:38,997
Down where We're going to go.

141
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,598
No, I mean,
These are not common.

142
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,868
To have a fully waterproof to,
Like, 90 feet metal detector,

143
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,271
Yeah, this is
Pretty cutting edge.

144
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,207
You find out where we need to go
With the sidescan.

145
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,542
I'll scan... Okay.

146
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,477
And then I'll talk back
To you with the comm system.

147
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,412
Yeah, I think it's going to be
A pretty good setup.

148
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,347
Let's do this.

149
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,417
Sonar is going in.

150
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,085
It's in.
All right, I'm recording.

151
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,888
All right, I'm going
To get suited up.

152
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,623
As I get ready to dive,

153
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,960
Port royal is
Materializing before us.

154
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,962
I'm seeing structures
That look like foundations.

155
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,231
It's very symmetrical...
One, two, three,

156
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,567
Four blocks in a row.

157
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,302
So this is super cool.

158
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:22,106
We can see hints of
Port royal's 2,000 buildings,

159
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,978
What once were densely packed
Brick and timber structures,

160
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,848
Some as tall as four stories.

161
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,850
All told, before
The earthquake hit,

162
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,187
Port royal stretched
Over 51 acres,

163
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,724
With 7,000 people living
Within its tight confines.

164
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,426
All right, here we go.

165
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,642
How many feet of
Visibility do you have?

166
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,350
That's not good.
Okay, but we'll work with that.

167
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:09,020
What I can clearly see
Is a thick layer of silt.

168
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,389
And seagrass covering
This sunken city.

169
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:21,633
As I explore, I see hints
Of rubble, which makes sense.

170
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,469
Given the violent destruction
Of port royal.

171
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,774
Based on eyewitness accounts,
We have a sense.

172
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,842
Of the last terrifying moments.

173
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,379
Of this entombed city.

174
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,981
When the earthquake struck,
The sandy ground.

175
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,984
Port royal was built on.

176
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:42,787
Vibrated so intensely
That it essentially liquefied.

177
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,525
The resulting quicksandlike
Sludge swallowed houses.

178
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,994
And their occupants whole.

179
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:52,129
Experts today believe that some
Of the remains of those.

180
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,934
Who perished are still sealed up
In the submerged buildings,

181
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,137
Making the city
Kind of a pirateera pompeii.

182
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,387
Whoa! What?

183
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,432
My goodness!

184
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,237
Have our hightech tools
Uncovered a new clue in the hunt.

185
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,272
For morgan's missing millions?

186
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:41,379
And later, we follow
Our treasure map.

187
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,047
Into the limestone depths.

188
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,583
Of the lush
Jamaican countryside.

189
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,785
This is, like, a little crack
And all of a sudden.

190
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,253
This huge cave opens up.

191
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,957
Perfect place for a pirate
To hide gold.

192
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,870
Stefan and I
Are in jamaica on the hunt.

193
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,607
For privateer henry morgan's
Lost treasure.

194
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,675
And I've just picked up
Something metallic.

195
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:13,478
In the sunken pirate city
Of port royal.

196
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,896
That could be our gold, rob.

197
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,199
And if you let a sea urchin
Stop us from finding that...

198
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,718
Okay.

199
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,819
Be careful.

200
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,995
Over the centuries, the sea
Has reclaimed these ruins.

201
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,133
Everything is covered
In a thick layer of sediment,

202
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,868
And in some spots, seagrass.

203
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,673
As I tried to dig, I can't help
But kick up a cloud of silt,

204
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,077
Making it hard to see what,
If anything, I'm uncovering.

205
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,882
Since the 1950s,

206
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,486
Archeologists have excavated
Assorted artifacts,

207
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,556
Like chinese porcelain
And glass bottles.

208
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:35,560
From the roughly 10% of the city
They've uncovered.

209
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:39,297
All of these objects helped
Paint a picture of port royal.

210
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,500
As a thriving trading hub
That attracted mariners.

211
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,369
And merchants
From around the globe.

212
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,506
But, there is a lot left
To be discovered here,

213
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,376
Perhaps even morgan's
Secret stash.

214
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,362
What did you find?

215
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,869
Like a gold coin?

216
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,146
Certainly not part of
Henry morgan's treasure.

217
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,418
But, I'm beginning to see
Evidence that suggests

218
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,188
I'm on top of a key part
Of port royal.

219
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,493
What's interesting?

220
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,799
Did you find lime street?

221
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,972
If you found lime street,
That's huge.

222
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,974
Thanks to historical records,

223
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,444
We know that lime street
Was one of old.

224
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,981
Port royal's most
Notable thoroughfares.

225
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,717
Merchants likely lived along
At least part of the street.

226
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,453
And quite often were the ones.

227
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:12,056
Holding the largest amount
Of valuable goods,

228
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,191
Since they were the conduits.

229
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:16,394
For getting that material
Back to england.

230
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,863
So if there were hidden riches,

231
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,733
There's a good shot
They'd be here.

232
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,401
I continued to trace
The road with stefan.

233
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,338
Guiding me from above.

234
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,941
Until I get closer To the shore.

235
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,410
But, I haven't picked up
Any gold or silver.

236
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,879
With my metal detector yet,

237
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,281
And while a pass
Across the larger area.

238
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,518
Is undoubtedly turning up
Some interesting finds...

239
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:48,359
There are still no signs
Of henry morgan's millions.

240
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,562
So I circled back to what
I think is our best lead.

241
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,098
For finding the loot...
Lime street.

242
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:02,173
If we could follow lime street
All the way to shore,

243
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,842
That'd be fantastic.

244
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,445
Not all of lime street
Was swallowed up by the sea.

245
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,981
Part of it lived on
In the small portion.

246
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,451
Of the city that didn't sink.

247
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,053
So maybe the treasure
We're after is actually.

248
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,122
Lurking below the land,

249
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,992
Possibly along this
Main thoroughfare.

250
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,192
Welcome!

251
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,595
My gosh, That was so cool.

252
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,397
We make our way back to shore.

253
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,666
And towards the dry part
Of lime street,

254
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,203
Which runs straight into
A dusty soccer field.

255
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,938
While it's pretty quiet today,

256
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,542
In 1692, This area of port royal.

257
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,610
Would have been
Teeming with life,

258
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,679
Filled with houses and shops.

259
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,614
That contained
Countless valuables.

260
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,817
It didn't all vanish
Into thin air.

261
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,218
When the earthquake struck.

262
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,622
In fact, much of what was here
Was reduced to rubble.

263
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,158
And over the centuries,
That rubble was covered.

264
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,829
By encroaching sand
And dirt and life.

265
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:01,098
So what lies Below our feet now?

266
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,102
It seems likely something
Is down there.

267
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:08,706
Lime street runs through here,
Roughly this direction.

268
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,840
It's going to be A lot of work.

269
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,509
I mean, this is a huge area.

270
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,711
Yeah.

271
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:14,913
Give you this stuff.

272
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,381
We've brought along
Groundpenetrating radar.

273
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,051
To create a 3d map Of the area.

274
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,654
This will allow us to locate
Lime street,

275
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,055
Pick up buildings,

276
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,991
And find gold or silver loot
That's buried here.

277
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:28,459
Good luck. All right.

278
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,860
While stefan gets to work,

279
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,596
I'm going to check out
Some of the treasure.

280
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,199
That did make it back from
Henry morgan's most famous raid.

281
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,469
And now lives at
The local anglican church.

282
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,005
Could these valuable artifacts
Give us a clue.

283
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,407
As to what might be missing.

284
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,143
Or where the unaccounted
Loot ended up?

285
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,079
Good afternoon, how are you?

286
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,414
How are you doing?

287
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,816
Althea gordon is a church
Committee member here.

288
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,484
At st. Peter's.

289
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,619
Here we have the silver.

290
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,356
All of this was stolen
From the church.

291
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,825
Of the golden altar In panama.

292
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:01,959
Wait, so these...

293
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,029
So henry morgan
And the pirates stole it.

294
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,430
Is it okay for me
To touch these?

295
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,898
Yes, you can.

296
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,433
Wow, this is incredible.

297
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,103
Beautiful silver...
Originally brought here.

298
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,438
From panama.

299
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,306
And I believe you don't have
Silver like that again.

300
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,642
Well, I've never seen
Anything quite like this.

301
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,447
While this church was built
After the 1692 earthquake,

302
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,716
These relics were given
To the anglican church.

303
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,518
In port royal sometime earlier,

304
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,922
Reportedly by
Henry morgan himself.

305
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:34,058
The heft, the craftsmanship,
The quality...

306
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,726
Just imagine if
There's more of this.

307
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,461
Buried out On the soccer field.

308
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,597
It is beautiful.
So you still use this today?

309
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,931
Yes, we do.

310
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,668
But there's one piece
That serves no holy purpose.

311
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,937
This was henry morgan's
Wine jug.

312
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,339
No kidding!

313
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,675
Yes, when he wanted wine, he
Would blow on the whistle there.

314
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,077
That's a large wine jug. Yes.

315
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:57,215
That's enough wine every night
To put you to sleep.

316
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:01,819
Henry morgan was no saint and
Was known to be a heavy drinker,

317
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,756
Which would make him
Right at home in port royal.

318
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,424
When the earthquake
Struck in 1692,

319
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,560
Many believed it
Was an act of god.

320
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,428
Meant to destroy A wicked city.

321
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,031
Where money was worshipped
Above all else,

322
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,635
And man had lost his way
Among the booze, bars,

323
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,036
And brothels.

324
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,906
Althea tells me there's even
A local legend of a church.

325
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,675
That sunk to the bottom
Of the sea in the catastrophe,

326
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,712
Completely intact,
And full of gold.

327
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,047
Church went down intact.

328
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,182
Because it is
The people on the land.

329
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,917
That were evil, Not the church.

330
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,986
They say you could hear
The bell ringing.

331
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,390
Or on a very clear morning,
You could go there and look.

332
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,059
But it's under the water.

333
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,395
I used to have a granna
That said,

334
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:48,599
"The gold under the water
Is for port royal people,

335
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,468
But the righteous generation."

336
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,006
So anything that god put down
Is to stay down,

337
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:58,543
But it will come up for those
Who he thinks are worthy.

338
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,677
That's a pretty
High bar to reach.

339
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,414
And I didn't see
Any evidence of a church.

340
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,349
Full of gold While on my dive.

341
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,820
But still, legend is
Often rooted in fact,

342
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,022
So the idea that there could be
Some treasure somewhere.

343
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,223
In port royal.

344
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,960
Just seems more
And more possible.

345
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,496
I'm very curious to see how
Stefan's doing with his scan.

346
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,301
God, it is so hot.

347
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,037
While I've been in the relative
Cool of the church,

348
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,373
He's been hard at work
Getting an initial peek.

349
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,243
Beneath the soccer field.

350
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,379
I'm pretty sure I've seen
Lime street here on the gpr.

351
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,315
Just a matter
Of modeling it now.

352
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,117
Maybe even Building foundations.

353
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,452
It's hard to tell.

354
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,121
But there's a lot of stuff
Underground here.

355
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,324
Stefan! Hey!

356
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,659
You getting anything?

357
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,394
I did.

358
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,530
I think I found evidence
Of lime street.

359
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:56,867
Or at least some street
From the old port royal times.

360
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,202
No kidding.

361
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,538
But stefan also found
Something more unexpected.

362
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,673
And potentially Groundbreaking.

363
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,208
What really intrigued me
Was I was running.

364
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,144
Over specifically this area,
Kind of near this pile,

365
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,882
I found a large metallic object
At about 6 feet down.

366
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,417
There's something here.

367
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,355
What has stefan unearthed from
Port royal's mysterious past?

368
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,223
Right here.

369
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,625
"X" marks the spot.

370
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,095
We're going to get a closer
Look at this promising patch.

371
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:26,096
I mean, I don't want to
Jump ahead of myself,

372
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,999
But it could be
A treasure chest.

373
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,578
Underground tech expert
Stefan burns and I.

374
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,912
Are in jamaica,

375
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,783
On the hunt for pirate
Henry morgan's lost treasure.

376
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,318
And stefan thinks
He may have found.

377
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,520
A metallic object
6 feet underground,

378
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,789
Along a buried portion
Of lime street,

379
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,058
A main road in old port royal.

380
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,928
I found a large Metallic object.

381
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,998
Kind of near this pile,
At about 6 feet down.

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,333
So how big was it?

383
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,668
It was actually about
The size of this pile.

384
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,602
No way!

385
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,671
But I know It's not this pile.

386
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,939
Because the center
Is roughly over here.

387
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,474
We'll have to measure it out.

388
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,210
And I didn't see anything
Above it for 6 feet,

389
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,813
So it was completely
Blank for 6 feet...

390
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,550
And then all of a sudden,
Boom, there it was.

391
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,352
Right here.

392
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,954
I think that's basically
The center of this.

393
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,956
You just created yourself
A treasure map.

394
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,825
A treasure map.
"X" marks the spot.

395
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:30,827
We're going to take another pass
Over this smaller area.

396
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,097
With the gpr
To get a closer look.

397
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,632
At what's going on below us.

398
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,901
All right, you want me
To just do the first pass?

399
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,235
You do as much
As you want to do.

400
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,670
All right, why don't you
Set it up, I'll run it.

401
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,837
I know you're Kind of delicate,

402
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,173
So if the sun is
A little too hot for you,

403
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,775
You can go sit In the shade.

404
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,243
All right, cool?

405
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,186
This will be the last pass.

406
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,721
Once we complete our scans,

407
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,856
Stefan can create
One of the firstever

408
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:02,259
3d maps of this section
Of this forgotten street.

409
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,261
Let me go ahead
And create the 3d here.

410
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,333
Holy moly!

411
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,735
It's definitely
Something right there.

412
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,536
Look at that!

413
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,138
There's a clear picture
Emerging,

414
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,073
Thanks to the gpr.

415
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,542
It does look like
We've found lime street,

416
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:21,478
Since we can trace it from
The sunken portion of the city.

417
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,614
Up onto dry land
To the area we just mapped.

418
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,218
We can see the foundations
Of the buildings,

419
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,754
Even an intersection
With another road.

420
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:32,623
Perhaps most intriguing,
That metallic object,

421
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,159
Which measures
About 6 by 8 feet,

422
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,828
Appears to lie
Inside a structure.

423
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,630
I mean, I don't want to
Jump ahead of myself,

424
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,832
But it could be
A treasure chest.

425
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:42,899
Yeah. You know what I mean?

426
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,501
We can't rule it out.

427
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,170
Perhaps this chest
Or safe was buried.

428
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,339
Beneath the floorboards
Of a house,

429
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,309
A tavern, or even
A merchant storehouse.

430
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,046
And when the 1692 earthquake
Turned port royal into rubble,

431
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,182
It was lost to history,
Until now.

432
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,718
This is amazing!

433
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,386
We'll file a request
With the government.

434
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,254
For a permit to dig here,

435
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,457
And in the meantime,
Look for other clues.

436
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,927
As to where henry morgan's
Treasure may be hidden.

437
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,397
It seems possible he would have
Had multiple hiding spots,

438
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,198
And perhaps one of them
Was farther.

439
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,201
From the masses Of port royal.

440
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:20,938
And closer to where morgan
May have called home.

441
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,807
So stefan and I pack up
And head to the jamaica archives.

442
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,475
In spanish town.

443
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,277
It houses the island's
Old records,

444
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,281
All the way back
To the pirate heyday.

445
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:33,551
If we can find evidence
Of property morgan owned,

446
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:37,555
It could help us determine
Where to turn next.

447
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,690
All right, this is what
We're looking for here.

448
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,227
Let me have One of those gloves.

449
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:47,431
So this here shows his patent,
Essentially, his block of land.

450
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,833
While it may seem odd
That a highseas criminal.

451
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,636
Would leave his mark
In the official record books.

452
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,971
Of the provincial government,

453
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:59,376
Henry morgan wasn't entirely the
Scallywag some assume he was.

454
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,580
It turns out, his piracy
Was mostly legitimate.

455
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:05,383
And in service
To the english crown.

456
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:09,319
Facing a dominant spanish armada
In the 17th century,

457
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,788
Britain turned to
Independent sea captains.

458
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,191
To protect its interests
In the caribbean.

459
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,994
It was a means of military
Outsourcing...

460
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,930
Grant private vessels
The right to raid enemy ships.

461
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,132
And keep a portion
Of the captured plunder.

462
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,935
The rest of the profit would go
Into the government coffers,

463
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:28,472
So britain could raise funds,
Protect its own trade routes,

464
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,208
And destroy its most
Potent adversary,

465
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,545
All without having to risk
Its own limited resources.

466
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:38,549
Aside from his attack
On panama city in 1670,

467
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,618
Henry morgan launched
Numerous raids.

468
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,754
On nearby spanishheld cuba.

469
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,891
And other panamanian ports
In the 1660s.

470
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,962
Each action helped strike a blow
To spain's power in the region.

471
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,364
And enrich all parties involved.

472
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,267
With all his success,

473
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:00,104
Morgan became one of the crown's
Preferred privateers,

474
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:04,174
And in november 1673, In london,

475
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,844
King charles ii
Officially hailed morgan.

476
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,647
As a hero,
Knighting the sea captain,

477
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:13,584
And appointing him the new
Lieutenant governor of jamaica.

478
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,920
The onetime pirate
Returned to the island.

479
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:18,389
Even more legitimate
Than when he left,

480
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:21,392
As sir henry morgan,

481
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:24,194
And he turned from
Privateering to planting,

482
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,798
Quickly becoming a member
Of the landed elite.

483
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,267
I'm just thinking if we're
Looking for treasure,

484
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,804
We should be looking where
Sir henry morgan's estate was.

485
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,272
One of his more remote holdings.

486
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,340
Lies on the other side
Of the island,

487
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,209
At the top of a large hill,

488
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:43,547
Perfect for a lookout
And perhaps a hiding place.

489
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,617
Further research suggests
An intriguing rumor.

490
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,951
About this estate,

491
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,154
Now called firefly.

492
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,556
For years, people have said
That a tunnel exists.

493
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,824
Beneath this plot of land,

494
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,362
Intended as an escape route
For henry morgan himself,

495
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:01,031
Should the spanish or any
Other old enemy decide.

496
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:04,635
To take revenge or come
In search of his riches.

497
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,504
The passageway supposedly
Runs from his house.

498
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,773
Down to a nearby port.

499
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,576
If true, this opening would also
Be a perfect place.

500
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,645
To squirrel away treasure.

501
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,714
This will lead us in
The right direction, I think.

502
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,116
All right, let's do it.

503
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,519
As stefan and I head
North from kingston,

504
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,521
Are we closing in
On henry morgan's.

505
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,589
Mighty stash of pirate loot?

506
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,257
My god! What do you see?

507
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,394
This keeps going
Right towards the house.

508
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,673
Stefan and I Are heading north.

509
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,876
To privateer henry morgan's
Vast estate...

510
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,278
Firefly.

511
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,013
We've heard whisperings
Of an underground tunnel system.

512
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,482
Beneath the grounds,

513
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:55,219
A seemingly ideal spot to stash
His missing millions.

514
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:59,156
In gold and silver
Pirate plunder.

515
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:03,294
Situated on the northern coast,
Firefly is perhaps best known.

516
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,296
As the jamaican home
Of british actor.

517
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:08,499
And playwright, noel coward.

518
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,567
Coward often hosted
Famous friends.

519
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,103
Like winston churchill
And elizabeth taylor.

520
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,372
At his hilltop retreat.

521
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,575
But before it was a playground
For the rich and famous,

522
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,912
It provided solitude and
Safety to henry morgan.

523
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,381
And walking up, it isn't
Hard to understand.

524
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,917
Why he may have been
Drawn to this spot.

525
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,386
Over 60 miles From port royal.

526
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,988
Holy moly!

527
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,589
Look at this!

528
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,591
This is incredible.

529
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,128
This is incredible.

530
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,998
And if you were a pirate, this
Would be the perfect lookout.

531
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah, this is Prime real estate.

532
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,670
I can see why captain morgan
Just snatched this up.

533
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,938
And put this hideout here.

534
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,476
I mean, you can probably
See 15 miles.

535
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:54,478
It would be really
Difficult to get up here.

536
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,946
There would be no risk of
Getting hit by cannonballs.

537
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,817
Morgan could have seen
Anyone approaching from the sea.

538
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,487
And a landbased attack
Through the dense forest.

539
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,689
Would have been
Nearly impossible.

540
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,425
These are perfect conditions if
You're looking for a safe spot.

541
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,828
To hide a stash,

542
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,164
And not just because
Of the view.

543
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,567
I think there's a high
Likelihood of their being.

544
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,235
A cave or tunnel system,

545
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,370
Just based off the fact
That, like, right there,

546
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,172
That's limestone At the surface.

547
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,841
Yeah, there's
Limestone all over.

548
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,175
That stuff Loves to dissolve.

549
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,044
And create the elaborate,
Intricate,

550
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,446
Like, cave networks And caverns.

551
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,714
And he could have
Easily repurposed.

552
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,449
Some of those into a tunnel.

553
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,252
And if he had the tunnels, it
Would be perfect to hide loot.

554
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,787
Let's first see if
There's anybody here.

555
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:39,056
That we can talk to.

556
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,125
Hello!

557
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,727
- Hey!
- Hey!

558
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,263
- Hi, there!
- Welcome to firefly, man.

559
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,467
Victor taylor is the caretaker
Here at the estate.

560
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:53,604
If anyone can clue us into the
History of this place,

561
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:54,738
It's him.

562
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,407
Welcome, this is the old
16th century building,

563
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,209
Used to be the pirate lookout.

564
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,211
Whoa!

565
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,681
It's been updated
Slightly over the centuries,

566
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:06,550
But this structure dates back
To henry morgan's time.

567
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:07,685
Wow!

568
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,420
Okay, notice the thickness
Of the walls.

569
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,421
This is original? Original.

570
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,956
Was this captain morgan's...?

571
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,424
That's one of his swords.

572
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,627
The bayonet, yes.

573
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:18,762
These are cannonballs, here?

574
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:20,564
Yes, cannonballs.
Can I grab one?

575
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:21,565
Grab one, no problem.

576
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:24,101
My god!

577
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,569
Imagine that thing
Lobbing at you.

578
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:29,106
My go... holy crud, That's heavy!

579
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:30,240
Yeah.

580
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,442
I didn't expect it
To be that heavy.

581
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:32,709
These aren't the only hints.

582
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,379
Of the property's Violent past.

583
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,847
That's, like, a human jaw
Right there.

584
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,315
Yep, that's it.

585
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,851
That's creepy.

586
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,719
I was expecting...

587
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,457
Well, I was not expecting
To see a human skull.

588
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,992
Where did you find the skull?

589
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,594
On the property.

590
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:51,995
Wow.

591
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,064
I mean, How creepy is this?

592
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,735
Bones and bayonets,
But how about gold and silver?

593
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,604
Stefan and I are here because
We're trying to follow.

594
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:03,072
The path of morgan's treasure.

595
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,210
And I've heard there are
Tunnel systems here.

596
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,211
And this was his old estate.

597
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,414
I'm curious if you know
Anything about that.

598
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,683
No, I don't know nothing
Much about the treasure.

599
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:15,753
I've been looking for years
And I don't find any.

600
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:19,422
But he has heard rumors
Of tunnels leading to the ocean.

601
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,026
And he knows of a deep hole in
The brush right near the house,

602
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:25,762
Which could be the beginning
Of a subterranean opening.

603
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,965
It's just out The side there.

604
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,099
Yeah, let's check it out.

605
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,704
Look at all This limestone?

606
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:36,907
Yeah, victor, this is
All bedrock right here?

607
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,375
Yes, all limestone.

608
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:41,311
Look at, you can see...

609
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,981
Look at that.

610
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:46,249
It's all weathered out.

611
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,919
Doesn't look like it takes much
To dissolve away this rock.

612
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,387
No. Not at all.

613
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,923
Looks promising.

614
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:56,593
The hole is almost entirely
Hidden in a tangle of ferns.

615
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,061
You can see it.

616
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,596
I don't see an opening.

617
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,199
There's something.
Here, I got a light...

618
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,468
Have you ever been in here?

619
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,869
You've never been in?

620
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,271
Do you know anybody
Who's ever been in there?

621
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,542
Stefan is eager to jump in
And use his welltrained eye.

622
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:15,612
To evaluate
Whatever lurks below.

623
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,280
My god!

624
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,217
Does it keep going?
What do you see?

625
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:24,220
Yeah, this keeps going
Right towards the house.

626
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,156
It looks like
It's been filled in.

627
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,557
Really?

628
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,227
It goes in about 10 feet, kind
Of at an angle like this,

629
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:34,297
Right, and then just looks like
It's been filled in.

630
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,032
There's some trash back here.

631
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,569
Just over the years
Filled it in.

632
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,772
But crawling in here's not going
To accomplish anything.

633
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:48,111
But I think running the gpr and
Following this will do a lot.

634
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,981
A gpr scan of the property
Will bring to light.

635
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,249
Tunnels or openings.

636
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:55,318
That may be lurking beneath
The manicured grounds,

637
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,254
Natural or manmade.

638
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:59,455
While stefan gets
Going with the gpr,

639
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,459
I'm going to take a sweep
With a tool called a schonstedt,

640
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,062
A type of
Magneticfield detector.

641
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:07,130
That means it will pick up
Any disturbances.

642
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:09,933
In the natural magnetic field
Of the earth,

643
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:14,271
Which would indicate a large
Metal object buried below.

644
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:18,608
Within minutes, stefan
Starts seeing something.

645
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,676
That was something.

646
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,011
Hey, rob!

647
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,212
Yeah?

648
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,280
Dude, I'm seeing tons
Of stuff up here!

649
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,815
Will our cuttingedge map.

650
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,151
Turn up any new clues
In the hunt.

651
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,520
For henry morgan's
Hidden treasure?

652
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:47,304
I'm with underground tech expert
Stefan burns in jamaica,

653
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:50,039
Peering beneath the surface
Of pirate henry morgan's.

654
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,776
Onetime estate.

655
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:55,312
We're on the hunt
For his lost treasure.

656
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:58,782
And it looks like we may have
Just found a clue.

657
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:02,452
Dude, I'm seeing
Tons of stuff up here.

658
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,586
What've you got?

659
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,055
So, I wasn't even
Scanning that long.

660
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:06,390
Look at this.

661
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,124
You can see them scattered
All throughout this image.

662
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,727
That's the one
I just rolled over.

663
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,395
I saw another one on
The other side of that rock,

664
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,131
Right about here.

665
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,334
And you put them in a line,

666
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,602
It's trending this direction.

667
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,672
Well, it's heading right
To morgan's hideout.

668
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,006
Right over there.

669
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:26,543
Stefan has just revealed
An opening beneath the lawn,

670
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,413
Part of a possible passageway
That runs below us.

671
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,483
But could this tunnel connect
With a larger system,

672
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,953
One that could potentially
Lead from the shore.

673
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,555
All the way up to the estate?

674
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,223
That's what's long
Been rumored...

675
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,826
That henry morgan could get
To his lookout from the harbor.

676
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,096
Below using A secret passageway.

677
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,965
And if such a network
Or cavern does exist,

678
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:53,570
Could it hold any of morgan's
Pilfered gold and silver?

679
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:57,040
Victor, the caretaker, suggests
We talk to a neighbor,

680
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,442
Who may have a new lead
On another part of this.

681
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:00,910
Supposed system.

682
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,579
Are you the guy that knows
About the tunnels?

683
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:03,714
Yeah, man.

684
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:06,316
Tabai has worked on
The property for years.

685
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,252
And is intimately acquainted
With its nooks and crannies.

686
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,854
The rumor is that
There are tunnels.

687
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:14,391
That go from henry morgan's
Estate out to the ocean.

688
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,658
Yeah, man.

689
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,461
And do we know where
Those tunnel systems are?

690
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:18,862
Yeah, man. Yeah, man.

691
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,263
Could you take us over there?
Yeah, man, no problem.

692
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:23,733
From what he's seen,
He thinks it's more of a cave.

693
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,068
But he can take us
To the entrance.

694
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,605
So that we can explore further.

695
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,474
This is an unexpected
Breakthrough.

696
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,211
This is the entrance
To the cave?

697
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,878
Yeah, man.

698
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,348
It's little more than
A crack in the rock.

699
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,549
And until we get it in there,

700
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:43,019
I'll have no idea how
Far the opening goes.

701
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,021
All right.

702
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,355
Time to get skinny.

703
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,758
I got stuck in a cave
Like this, this summer.

704
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,159
It's probably fine.

705
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,962
I think you're good. Yeah.

706
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,963
You know the good news is
There's no venomous snakes.

707
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,768
I heard there's lots
Of cave scorpions, though.

708
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,368
Okay.

709
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,173
Here, take mine, too, and then
I'm going squeeze in there.

710
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,374
Come on down.

711
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,376
All right.
See you on the other side.

712
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,513
My god.

713
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:11,114
It just keeps going.

714
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:14,117
Almost immediately,
The cave begins to open up.

715
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,519
This is, like, a little crack
And you just crawl through,

716
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,922
All of a sudden,
This huge cave opens up.

717
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,061
All right, well, let's head down
A little bit further,

718
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:26,396
See if we can follow
This thing to the exit.

719
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,265
Yeah, we need to see
Where this goes.

720
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,267
Okay.
I think it's right down here.

721
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,737
Okay, I'm going down.

722
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:39,008
All right, stefan, as you're
Coming down, just be careful,

723
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,477
'cause there is a big dropoff.

724
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,679
Right on the other side
Of your foot there.

725
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,681
Yep.

726
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,818
It just keeps going.

727
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,852
Okay.

728
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,822
You know, if you look around,

729
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:55,759
You can see little tiny
Entrances all over the place.

730
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,026
There's one over there.

731
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,761
There's one over this way.

732
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,231
Because of the nature
Of the limestone rock,

733
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,033
There are opening
And small caverns.

734
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:05,302
Scattered all over the place.

735
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:06,903
There's a giant hole Right here.

736
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,972
Like, if you were going
To hide any treasure...

737
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,107
You're going
To try to stick this in here.

738
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,844
Okay.

739
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:17,514
And there's some giant
Mole crickets in there.

740
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:19,583
No gold.

741
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:22,318
There's clearly other
Cracks and crevasses...

742
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,920
Really? ...That can be explored.

743
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,189
I mean, each one of these
Little cracks here.

744
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,058
Branches into 10 new ones.

745
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,330
Well, this is
Absolutely fascinating.

746
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,134
Given their Geological features,

747
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,070
It's easy to see why caves
Have been synonymous.

748
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:44,674
With hidden treasures
Throughout history.

749
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,943
In fact, they're believed
To hold some of.

750
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:50,280
The most spectacular
Collections of riches.

751
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,550
The caves of central asia's
Hindu kush mountains.

752
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,151
Reportedly housed the fortunes.

753
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,753
Of an 18th century
Persian invader,

754
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,955
A colossal cache.

755
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:02,559
Estimated to be worth
Half a trillion dollars.

756
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:06,363
In india, the bizarrelooking
Son bhandar stone chambers.

757
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,231
Are said to hide
A secret passage.

758
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:12,235
That leads to the royal
Treasures of an ancient king.

759
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,038
But while these riches
Have yet to be found,

760
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,639
A stunning discovery was made.

761
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,177
In a northern israeli cave
In 2015,

762
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,046
A rare collection
Of jewelry and coins.

763
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,848
That date back 2,300 years.

764
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,252
To the reign
Of alexander the great.

765
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,054
As we explore this cave,

766
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:34,191
It's also clear
That we are not alone.

767
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:37,994
Sounds like you're not
A fan of the bat.

768
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,395
No, I don't mind bats,

769
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,798
I just don't want them
Flying in my face.

770
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,600
All right, let's keep moving,
Stefan.

771
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:53,610
I don't know if henry morgan hid
Any of his gold down here,

772
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:57,813
But if you were wanting
A place to hide stuff,

773
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,683
This would be
A good place for it.

774
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,485
If we could find a connection
From here to his hideout,

775
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,288
Or even just a new tunnel
System, I mean, we're golden.

776
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,689
We just need to look for it.

777
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,026
I mean, it's clear there's lots
Of tunnels under these rocks.

778
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,096
I mean, there's probably
Hundreds and hundreds of tunnels.

779
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,964
That have yet to be
Exposed to the surface.

780
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,566
We might need to bust out
The technology.

781
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,167
To help us map This cave pool.

782
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,903
And all these cracks
And crevasses.

783
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,971
That's what we're all about.

784
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,441
Stefan has brought along
A handheld lidar device.

785
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,509
For just this purpose.

786
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:29,178
It will create threedimensional
Renderings of the cave.

787
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,648
That can be analyzed
With precision.

788
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,451
So we'll be able to locate
Any possible connection points.

789
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:37,253
To other tunnels that
May run up to morgan's.

790
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,256
Lookout or down
To the harbor below.

791
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,124
I'm also going to grab
The metal detector.

792
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,060
So we can do
A sweep of the cave.

793
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:47,063
This is a limestone cave so if
There was any metal down here,

794
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:50,466
Any loot, it was unfound,
He would pick it up.

795
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,801
We have a good game plan.

796
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,536
All right, I'll let you
Start scanning,

797
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:54,871
I'll go grab The metal detector.

798
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:55,805
Cool.

799
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,740
Crawl my way out.

800
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,142
Let's rock and roll.

801
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,881
Wow...

802
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,420
Are we about to break
New ground in the hunt.

803
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:13,622
For henry morgan's
Missing pirate loot?

804
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,026
Right there, right there.

805
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,909
Stefan and I are
Exploring a cave.

806
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:36,779
On the grounds of pirate
Henry morgan's old hideaway,

807
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,516
And stefan has just finished
Doing a lidar scan.

808
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:40,917
Of the interior.

809
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,656
Hey! You get anything?

810
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,192
It needs to be processed.

811
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,594
You got the metal detector.

812
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,595
Yep.

813
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,597
Stefan starts the
Lidar processing.

814
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,333
While I begin
My scan of the cave.

815
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,936
If henry morgan buried
Any treasure in there,

816
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:03,406
This hightech tool
Should bring it to light.

817
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:06,609
I start at one end and move
My way towards the other.

818
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,015
When suddenly...

819
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,616
yeah, buddy!

820
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:14,951
Right here.

821
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,420
That's a good signal.

822
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,021
Right there, right there.

823
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,096
You found it? This is weird.

824
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:27,696
What is it?

825
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,499
Is that an old buckle
Or something?

826
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,100
No.

827
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,635
Where's your light?

828
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:33,903
Doesn't that look like The hinge.

829
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:37,974
On a treasure chest
Or something?

830
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,745
Know what this is,
Is an old saw.

831
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:47,584
This is where the handle
Affixed to it, like that.

832
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,719
We have one more section
To sweep.

833
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,090
Something right there.

834
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,659
We've scanned The whole cave.

835
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,537
God, it's really deep.

836
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,740
Almost like we need a shovel.

837
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,075
Imagine if we found
A gold coin right now.

838
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,345
Trust me, I'm imagining it.

839
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:23,686
Let me scan one more time
Just to make sure.

840
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,955
It's in this pile.

841
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,490
Maybe it's a coin.

842
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,158
Could be and I could have
Scooped something up.

843
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,094
It's in there somewhere.

844
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,497
Stefan keeps digging, until...

845
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,166
Hey, I found it!

846
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,968
What is it?

847
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,104
It's a metal cap Or something.

848
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,640
Looks like a shotgun shell.

849
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,776
Crud! Look at that.

850
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,512
I thought we had our coin.

851
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:51,780
It's over 100 years old.
It's got to be.

852
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,850
And if this dates back To 1900,

853
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:56,586
People have had this idea
For a long time.

854
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:59,188
I mean, we went down over a foot
To find this thing,

855
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,258
Which means that
If there was gold here,

856
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,260
It could be even
Deeper than that.

857
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,062
Yeah.

858
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,999
Let's see what the 3d
Lidar map has turned up.

859
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:13,469
The rendering is remarkable
In its detail.

860
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,939
Dozens of small crevasses
And passages line the walls,

861
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:20,609
Making this cave a perfect
Spot to stash pirate loot.

862
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:24,614
But even more telling is this
Cave's shape and orientation.

863
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:28,284
Stretching some 30 feet inward,
It's positioned in line.

864
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,487
With both henry morgan's
Old lookout.

865
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,021
And the harbor.

866
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,089
Taken with the evidence
Of tunnels we found.

867
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,424
On the top of the hill,

868
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,293
Could we have finally
Unearthed proof.

869
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,696
Of a long lost pirate
Escape tunnel,

870
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,364
One that could have
Given henry morgan.

871
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,566
Direct access to the beach.

872
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,502
Or a place to store
His missing loot?

873
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,838
It seems increasingly likely.

874
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Whoa! Made it!

875
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,176
I would say almost guaranteed
There's gold down here.

876
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:56,579
Yeah. And we're getting closer
And closer to finding it.

877
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,981
We've made enormous progress
In our search.

878
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,050
For captain morgan's treasure,

879
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,186
From discovering
Possible tunnels.

880
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,588
To locating a suspicious
Metallic object.

881
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,591
Along wealthy lime street
In port royal,

882
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:12,529
An intriguing glimmer
Of pirateera antiquities.

883
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:16,132
We're going to file for permits
To dig in these suspicious spots.

884
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,735
With the hope that finally
We will unearth

885
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:21,271
Henry morgan's Missing millions.
