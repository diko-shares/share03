00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.065
<i>Between the years</i>
<i>when the oceans drank Atlantis</i>

2
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:09.780
<i>and the rise of the sons of Aryas,
there was an age undreamed of,</i>

3
00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:13.909
<i>when shining kingdoms
lay spread across the world.</i>

4
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.914
<i>Then came the dark empire of Acheron,</i>

5
00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:22.585
<i>where cruel Necromancers
sought secrets of resurrection.</i>

6
00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:27.006
<i>They crafted a mask
from the bones of kings</i>

7
00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:31.051
<i>and awakened its wrath
with the pure blood of their daughters.</i>

8
00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:35.473
<i>The mask summoned spirits
of unspeakable evil,</i>

9
00:01:35.557 --> 00:01:38.518
<i>giving them power
no mortal men should possess.</i>

10
00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:49.821
<i>Acheron enslaved the civilized world.</i>

11
00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:56.663
<i>Only the Barbarian tribes
were left to rise up against them.</i>

12
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.876
<i>The mask was shattered and Acheron fell.</i>

13
00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:10.093
<i>Each tribe kept a single shard</i>

14
00:02:10.177 --> 00:02:13.721
<i>so that no man might attempt
to join them back together</i>

15
00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:18.185
<i>and drive the world
once again into chaos and ruin.</i>

16
00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:21.522
<i>Their pieces were scattered
across the land</i>

17
00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:24.483
<i>and remained hidden for ages.</i>

18
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.282
<i>But prophecy spoke of a man who would
some day try to reassemble the mask</i>

19
00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.578
<i>and rule the world.</i>

20
00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:42.126
<i>So came the dawn of Hyborian Age,
a time both bleak and brutal.</i>

21
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:45.046
<i>And so came a child.</i>

22
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.549
<i>Born of battle.</i>

23
00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.702
Fialla!

24
00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.835
Fialla.

25
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.047
Do not speak, my love.
Do not speak.

26
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:28.634
I must see my child before I die.

27
00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:15.599
Name your son.

28
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.269
His name

29
00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:20.438
is Conan.

30
00:05:33.472 --> 00:05:34.849
Slow down, Conan!

31
00:05:48.112 --> 00:05:52.535
When a Cimmerian feels thirst,
it is the thirst for blood.

32
00:05:55.537 --> 00:05:59.750
When he feels cold,
it is the cold edge of steel.

33
00:06:01.877 --> 00:06:04.213
But the courage
of the Cimmerian is tempered.

34
00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:08.759
He neither fears death
nor rushes foolishly to meet it.

35
00:06:09.718 --> 00:06:11.804
But to be a Cimmerian warrior,

36
00:06:11.887 --> 00:06:16.435
you must have both cunning and
balance, as well as speed and strength.

37
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:22.607
Conan.

38
00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.821
I gave you chores, boy.

39
00:06:27.904 --> 00:06:29.531
Finished, Father.

40
00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:38.957
First to circle the hills
and return the egg unbroken

41
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.002
earns the right to
fight with the warriors.

42
00:06:53.514 --> 00:06:56.476
Well, by Crom, boy,
what are you waiting for?

43
00:08:34.204 --> 00:08:35.663
We go back.

44
00:08:38.123 --> 00:08:39.334
Conan!

45
00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:27.488
Make way. Make way.

46
00:11:39.606 --> 00:11:41.941
Come. Time to forge a blade.

47
00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:10.846
This sword we make will be yours one day.

48
00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:23.734
But before you wield it,
you must understand it.

49
00:12:24.652 --> 00:12:27.072
The sword must bend or it will break.

50
00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:31.493
It must be tempered.

51
00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:44.673
What is most important
when forging a blade, fire or ice?

52
00:12:44.756 --> 00:12:45.841
Fire.

53
00:12:49.428 --> 00:12:50.471
Ice?

54
00:12:50.554 --> 00:12:52.432
Are you certain?

55
00:13:04.277 --> 00:13:08.156
Fire and ice together.

56
00:13:09.116 --> 00:13:11.034
This is the mystery of steel.

57
00:13:30.388 --> 00:13:32.015
You're still all fire, boy.

58
00:13:34.809 --> 00:13:35.935
No.

59
00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:38.855
Slow down. Find your footing.

60
00:13:46.946 --> 00:13:48.032
Enough!

61
00:14:01.546 --> 00:14:03.631
You're not ready for this sword.

62
00:16:57.062 --> 00:16:58.355
Fire!

63
00:17:12.746 --> 00:17:13.872
Fire!

64
00:17:38.773 --> 00:17:40.525
- Father!
- Conan!

65
00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:52.996
Father!

66
00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:54.122
Conan!

67
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.749
Die!

68
00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:00.128
Father!

69
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.614
Barbarian.

70
00:18:31.828 --> 00:18:34.497
There's no shame in kneeling before me.

71
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:47.177
Each of these brave warriors

72
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.099
has surrendered, left their lands,
sworn allegiance to me.

73
00:18:52.851 --> 00:18:56.270
They do so because
they know one day I will be a god.

74
00:18:56.813 --> 00:18:58.064
One day...

75
00:19:00.358 --> 00:19:05.197
...the other clans of Cimmeria will gather
for vengeance, and then god or no god,

76
00:19:06.198 --> 00:19:07.532
you will fall.

77
00:19:14.373 --> 00:19:16.250
You know why I'm here.

78
00:19:17.084 --> 00:19:20.545
One piece is missing from the mask.

79
00:19:21.213 --> 00:19:24.383
You know its power. Give it to me now...

80
00:19:30.723 --> 00:19:33.893
...or die and I'll find it for myself.

81
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.316
I prefer death.

82
00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:51.578
Oh, my nose!

83
00:20:07.429 --> 00:20:08.471
No!

84
00:20:26.406 --> 00:20:27.449
This is your son.

85
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.038
I like him.

86
00:21:12.622 --> 00:21:14.456
Come here, my daughter.

87
00:21:19.629 --> 00:21:23.508
Father, I sense the bone shard is close.

88
00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:26.344
Will you find it for me, Marique?

89
00:21:26.677 --> 00:21:27.970
Hmm.

90
00:21:29.972 --> 00:21:32.268
Barbarian, your son has courage.

91
00:21:33.852 --> 00:21:36.522
But my daughter has talents as well.

92
00:21:37.439 --> 00:21:39.274
Find it, Marique.

93
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.652
These Cimmerians, they do not pray.

94
00:21:42.027 --> 00:21:43.529
This is their church.

95
00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.865
This is what they worship.

96
00:21:47.449 --> 00:21:49.451
It will be here!

97
00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:30.077
The shard. She found the bone shard.

98
00:22:46.053 --> 00:22:48.847
Your mother would be proud.

99
00:22:54.228 --> 00:22:55.354
- Remo.
- Yeah?

100
00:22:55.437 --> 00:22:58.649
Gather the men. Burn everything.

101
00:22:58.733 --> 00:22:59.859
But, Zym!

102
00:22:59.942 --> 00:23:01.944
Not the boy. Not yet.

103
00:23:02.362 --> 00:23:06.240
Not yet. Look what he did to my face!

104
00:23:08.868 --> 00:23:11.955
Now, how do I punish you, huh?

105
00:23:13.623 --> 00:23:15.876
You fear not pain, nor death.

106
00:23:37.481 --> 00:23:39.483
Father! No!

107
00:23:41.443 --> 00:23:42.653
Father!

108
00:23:44.655 --> 00:23:45.697
No!

109
00:23:52.747 --> 00:23:54.499
Worse than death, eh, Cimmerian?

110
00:23:55.417 --> 00:23:56.959
Watching your son die.

111
00:24:00.923 --> 00:24:02.758
Because he loves you.

112
00:24:28.452 --> 00:24:29.786
It is complete.

113
00:24:30.369 --> 00:24:33.331
Marique, we're halfway there.

114
00:24:33.707 --> 00:24:37.211
When we find the pureblood, your mother,

115
00:24:38.295 --> 00:24:41.173
my beloved, will return.

116
00:24:45.635 --> 00:24:48.223
The mask is complete!

117
00:25:07.242 --> 00:25:10.495
Conan, you cannot save me.

118
00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:19.921
Let go of the chain, boy.

119
00:25:20.422 --> 00:25:22.758
- I'm not afraid to die!
- Nor I.

120
00:25:29.098 --> 00:25:30.516
I love you, son.

121
00:25:34.687 --> 00:25:36.272
No! No!

122
00:26:52.352 --> 00:26:56.690
<i>Conan left Cimmeria</i>
<i>and wandered the edges of the world,</i>

123
00:26:56.773 --> 00:26:59.860
<i>slaying, thieving, surviving,</i>

124
00:27:00.526 --> 00:27:06.742
<i>storming the high walls of Venarium
and prowling the dark seas among pirates.</i>

125
00:27:07.409 --> 00:27:11.913
<i>But the nameless man who slaughtered
his village and killed his father</i>

126
00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:14.500
<i>remained in shadow.</i>

127
00:27:30.308 --> 00:27:34.687
These are common slavers, Conan.
Not the man you seek. Why attack?

128
00:27:34.771 --> 00:27:37.565
No man should live in chains.

129
00:27:56.753 --> 00:27:57.921
Whoa.

130
00:28:04.928 --> 00:28:06.138
Fight!

131
00:28:43.594 --> 00:28:46.972
Stay and fight,
you pink-bellied motherless goat-lovers!

132
00:29:14.334 --> 00:29:16.002
Go. You're free.

133
00:29:19.756 --> 00:29:24.177
Go. Your masters are dead.
You are no longer slaves.

134
00:29:26.013 --> 00:29:28.849
But you've taken all our food,
all our weapons.

135
00:29:29.516 --> 00:29:30.976
Where would you have us go?

136
00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:40.110
Come on.

137
00:29:40.193 --> 00:29:42.029
We sail to Messantia.

138
00:29:44.699 --> 00:29:45.950
Whoa!

139
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:01.841
Come on.

140
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.471
Call it.

141
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:12.102
Come on, old man.

142
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.412
I win!

143
00:30:37.379 --> 00:30:38.422
I still win.

144
00:30:44.094 --> 00:30:48.057
When I first met him,
he was no bigger than you.

145
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.437
Just a scrawny little rat
picking pockets in Zamora.

146
00:30:54.688 --> 00:30:56.065
Even so,

147
00:30:56.607 --> 00:31:01.028
it was he who stole the Elephant's Heart

148
00:31:01.113 --> 00:31:03.406
and slew the sorcerer Yara.

149
00:31:06.618 --> 00:31:08.244
Come.

150
00:31:13.917 --> 00:31:16.712
Hey, mama. Need more mead.

151
00:31:21.884 --> 00:31:23.301
Who's next?

152
00:31:32.645 --> 00:31:37.275
Guards! There. And check there.

153
00:32:10.184 --> 00:32:12.770
Hey. Why are they looking for you?

154
00:32:12.854 --> 00:32:15.982
No. No, no, no. No, wait.
You don't understand.

155
00:32:19.694 --> 00:32:23.406
They'll be happy to take us both to prison
if you don't let go!

156
00:32:25.116 --> 00:32:26.660
Maybe I wanna go to prison.

157
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.538
You take the one in the middle?

158
00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:30.622
Me?

159
00:32:30.706 --> 00:32:32.624
- You.
- I'll take him.

160
00:32:45.054 --> 00:32:46.347
I am your prisoner.

161
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:48.432
Huh?

162
00:32:54.147 --> 00:32:57.066
You're calm for somebody
who's about to die.

163
00:32:58.401 --> 00:32:59.486
Move!

164
00:33:25.763 --> 00:33:27.599
Where's the captain?

165
00:33:27.724 --> 00:33:32.812
Hmm. Ah, the hill ape can speak.
The captain is currently occupied.

166
00:33:37.358 --> 00:33:40.279
Don't worry.
Everyone can get their chance.

167
00:33:55.836 --> 00:33:56.921
Hey!

168
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:03.469
Stop him!

169
00:34:12.645 --> 00:34:14.022
Come here!

170
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.237
Where is the captain of the guard?

171
00:34:20.321 --> 00:34:23.615
His door's sealed from within.
He can only open it for me.

172
00:34:30.582 --> 00:34:33.000
Guards! The door!

173
00:34:36.545 --> 00:34:37.880
All right.

174
00:34:41.134 --> 00:34:42.219
What?

175
00:34:52.229 --> 00:34:54.357
Guards! Guards!

176
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:14.543
You remember me?

177
00:35:15.378 --> 00:35:16.837
Who are you?

178
00:35:17.213 --> 00:35:18.715
I'm the one who made you pretty.

179
00:35:24.012 --> 00:35:26.390
You can't do this!
Do you know who I am?

180
00:35:43.699 --> 00:35:46.786
Where is the man who killed my father?

181
00:35:46.869 --> 00:35:49.247
You seek Khalar Zym?

182
00:35:53.293 --> 00:35:56.588
Zym. No.

183
00:35:57.548 --> 00:36:00.801
My people were slain by a common bandit,
not a king.

184
00:36:00.884 --> 00:36:05.013
He was a bandit then. He's a legend now.
A Shadow Lord.

185
00:36:08.017 --> 00:36:09.768
A Shadow Lord, huh?

186
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:14.773
Speak. I will not kill you.

187
00:36:16.442 --> 00:36:18.319
You know the Forbidden Forest?

188
00:36:18.402 --> 00:36:21.281
Nothing there but dead bodies
and the animals who feed on them.

189
00:36:21.364 --> 00:36:25.159
Even as we speak,
Khalar leads his legions through the mist.

190
00:36:26.578 --> 00:36:27.579
More.

191
00:36:27.662 --> 00:36:28.705
Not good enough.

192
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:29.997
No!

193
00:36:30.081 --> 00:36:32.668
Wait! The forest is large, I know.

194
00:36:32.751 --> 00:36:35.921
But as he returns to his stronghold
at Khor Kalba,

195
00:36:36.004 --> 00:36:39.007
he returns by way of the ravine
at Shaipur.

196
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:40.633
That's a perfect place for an ambush.

197
00:36:41.009 --> 00:36:43.011
What does Khalar want there?

198
00:36:43.095 --> 00:36:47.516
He's with his witch daughter.
They're searching for a young girl.

199
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.767
A pureblood.

200
00:36:48.851 --> 00:36:50.686
Are you leading me into a trap?

201
00:36:50.769 --> 00:36:52.730
No. I wouldn't lie to you.

202
00:36:53.439 --> 00:36:54.690
He's mad.

203
00:36:55.566 --> 00:37:00.238
He's obsessed with Acheronian sorcery.
I hold no loyalty to him.

204
00:37:02.448 --> 00:37:06.953
Well, Northerner,
I've upheld my part of the deal.

205
00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.003
No!

206
00:37:15.086 --> 00:37:16.213
Yes.

207
00:37:21.134 --> 00:37:23.721
By Mitra, what are you doing?

208
00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:28.267
Toasting to our deal!

209
00:37:40.696 --> 00:37:42.115
Hey! Northerner!

210
00:37:42.198 --> 00:37:44.200
Hey, hey, wait for me!

211
00:37:45.285 --> 00:37:47.246
Oh, god!

212
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:49.205
Prisoners of Messantia!

213
00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:53.251
The key to your freedom
sits in your captain's gut.

214
00:37:53.334 --> 00:37:57.172
You gave me your word!
You swore you'd spare my life!

215
00:37:57.255 --> 00:37:59.591
I said I would not kill you.

216
00:38:00.467 --> 00:38:01.844
Free yourselves.

217
00:38:11.604 --> 00:38:12.730
Stand down.

218
00:38:16.192 --> 00:38:19.153
Northerner! My name is Ela-Shan.

219
00:38:19.236 --> 00:38:22.574
Perhaps you've heard that there is no lock
I cannot break or vault I cannot enter.

220
00:38:24.284 --> 00:38:27.454
If you are ever foolish enough
to pursue this man to Khor Kalba,

221
00:38:27.537 --> 00:38:30.290
come see me in Argalon
so I can talk you out of it.

222
00:38:30.373 --> 00:38:32.417
Ask anyone you meet there for Ela-Shan!

223
00:38:48.685 --> 00:38:51.395
What do you see in my future,
Master Fassir?

224
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.690
It is unclear.

225
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:56.860
I see a journey.

226
00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:03.909
A man crossing the sands.

227
00:39:05.744 --> 00:39:07.121
A knight?

228
00:39:09.456 --> 00:39:10.790
A warrior.

229
00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:14.795
Your paths will merge.

230
00:39:16.672 --> 00:39:20.425
He will take you home to your birthplace.

231
00:39:27.934 --> 00:39:29.519
Is that all that you see, Master?

232
00:39:34.274 --> 00:39:36.692
Move!

233
00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:44.576
The pureblood is close.
I can taste her in the air.

234
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:17.570
Ah.

235
00:40:17.653 --> 00:40:21.489
There'll be rioting in Messantia for days,
thanks to you.

236
00:40:23.116 --> 00:40:24.492
Khalar Zym.

237
00:40:25.493 --> 00:40:26.619
What?

238
00:40:26.703 --> 00:40:28.706
That's the name of the man
who killed my father.

239
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.583
Zym?

240
00:40:31.625 --> 00:40:33.586
Do you know who that is?

241
00:40:34.002 --> 00:40:35.838
I am told he's the angel of death.

242
00:40:37.381 --> 00:40:39.132
I leave tonight to pursue him in Shaipur.

243
00:40:39.217 --> 00:40:42.303
We can sail as far as the bay
near the Shaipur Outpost.

244
00:40:43.054 --> 00:40:45.765
- Can you wait for me there.
- Wait?

245
00:40:46.015 --> 00:40:48.768
I'm not your serving maid.
I will go with you.

246
00:40:49.268 --> 00:40:53.232
Not this time, Artus.
This is something I must do alone.

247
00:42:01.428 --> 00:42:03.721
Go to the temple. Go! Go!

248
00:42:12.397 --> 00:42:14.775
Protect the master. Go! Go!

249
00:42:43.305 --> 00:42:45.349
Tamara, come with me.

250
00:42:56.527 --> 00:42:57.570
Get into the carriage.

251
00:42:57.653 --> 00:42:59.197
No, I want to stay here
and defend our home.

252
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.031
For the sake of your people,
you must leave this place

253
00:43:01.115 --> 00:43:02.992
and go to the monks in Hyrkania.
It is your duty.

254
00:43:03.075 --> 00:43:05.035
Do not hesitate and do not waver.

255
00:43:06.579 --> 00:43:07.956
I don't want to leave you.

256
00:43:08.039 --> 00:43:09.541
Do you trust me, Tamara?

257
00:43:09.625 --> 00:43:12.418
Yes. With my life. Everything I have.

258
00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:14.838
Then ask no more questions
and do as I say.

259
00:43:17.132 --> 00:43:18.299
Go!

260
00:43:19.717 --> 00:43:21.053
Let's go!

261
00:43:25.932 --> 00:43:27.726
Let none escape!

262
00:43:55.004 --> 00:43:56.298
Zym.

263
00:44:31.585 --> 00:44:33.002
Who are you?

264
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.223
Where's Khalar?

265
00:44:46.475 --> 00:44:47.685
Who is Khalar?

266
00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:57.612
Hey!

267
00:45:24.056 --> 00:45:25.517
Come here!

268
00:46:08.186 --> 00:46:10.021
Come on.

269
00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.623
Step aside, Northerner.

270
00:47:07.999 --> 00:47:10.042
The woman is property of Khalar Zym.

271
00:47:10.126 --> 00:47:11.752
She is my property now.

272
00:47:12.878 --> 00:47:14.713
Well, you have no claim to her.

273
00:47:15.006 --> 00:47:17.342
No. But I have a claim to you.

274
00:47:17.425 --> 00:47:19.469
And what claim is that?

275
00:47:21.053 --> 00:47:22.347
Death.

276
00:47:36.236 --> 00:47:37.279
Who are you?

277
00:47:41.492 --> 00:47:44.870
When you fight a Cimmerian, even a boy,

278
00:47:45.913 --> 00:47:47.039
you best kill him.

279
00:47:47.122 --> 00:47:49.207
I killed hundreds of Cimmerians.

280
00:47:49.292 --> 00:47:51.960
Yes. An entire village.

281
00:47:55.089 --> 00:47:58.301
But I did not burn in my father's forge.

282
00:48:00.553 --> 00:48:04.349
Run from me and I will tear apart
the mountains to find you.

283
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.560
I will follow you to hell.

284
00:48:17.405 --> 00:48:19.615
Woman! Come here.

285
00:48:21.909 --> 00:48:23.786
I said, come here.

286
00:48:26.872 --> 00:48:28.332
Hmm.

287
00:48:28.749 --> 00:48:33.171
Which one of you is the pureblood? Hmm?

288
00:48:37.467 --> 00:48:41.346
Whoever reveals her, gets to live.

289
00:48:46.393 --> 00:48:47.644
Mm.

290
00:48:51.147 --> 00:48:52.816
And you smell.

291
00:49:03.785 --> 00:49:08.125
Are you the one I seek?

292
00:49:08.583 --> 00:49:10.668
Could it be you?

293
00:49:28.228 --> 00:49:29.938
None of them are pure.

294
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.418
You know who I've come for.

295
00:49:49.501 --> 00:49:52.045
Why suffer for it?

296
00:49:54.172 --> 00:49:57.051
None of the ancient bloodline remain.

297
00:49:57.134 --> 00:50:01.221
Well, if this is true,
tell me why have you and these monks

298
00:50:01.305 --> 00:50:04.599
chosen to hide here like vermin
for a thousand years?

299
00:50:04.683 --> 00:50:07.019
We live here in peace.

300
00:50:07.477 --> 00:50:11.316
We have no riches. We do not make war.

301
00:50:12.066 --> 00:50:13.693
We value life.

302
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.611
You value life.

303
00:50:19.323 --> 00:50:22.118
Do you forget what happened
in the forests of Ophir?

304
00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:28.541
<i>When all the nations of Hyboria
hunted a woman as if she were an animal?</i>

305
00:50:30.585 --> 00:50:35.341
<i>When both I and my daughter were forced
to watch Maliva, my innocent wife,</i>

306
00:50:35.424 --> 00:50:38.135
<i>be lashed to the wheel and set aflame?</i>

307
00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.143
Huh?

308
00:50:47.353 --> 00:50:51.357
No. What you value is death.

309
00:50:53.192 --> 00:50:56.988
The monks here had no part in her death.

310
00:50:59.741 --> 00:51:01.659
Where is the pureblood?

311
00:51:13.422 --> 00:51:15.215
Not to fear, Father.

312
00:51:16.091 --> 00:51:18.636
He will tell me his secrets.

313
00:51:18.719 --> 00:51:21.054
They all tell me their secrets.

314
00:51:23.892 --> 00:51:27.103
Your vain pursuit
for the secrets of Acheron

315
00:51:28.229 --> 00:51:31.482
is a lust for power, not a love of life.

316
00:51:32.066 --> 00:51:34.986
Your innocent wife

317
00:51:35.069 --> 00:51:39.324
sought to enslave all of Hyboria
with her sorcery.

318
00:51:40.492 --> 00:51:42.952
She deserved to burn.

319
00:51:45.288 --> 00:51:48.751
You will never rule,

320
00:51:49.584 --> 00:51:53.756
and Maliva will never rise again!

321
00:51:55.799 --> 00:51:56.841
Die!

322
00:52:10.815 --> 00:52:12.859
My lord!

323
00:52:12.943 --> 00:52:15.946
Remo is searching
for the one that got away.

324
00:52:17.447 --> 00:52:19.282
She is the pureblood.

325
00:52:21.827 --> 00:52:24.038
Remo will capture her for me.

326
00:52:38.803 --> 00:52:40.179
Come here!

327
00:52:51.024 --> 00:52:52.067
Whoa.

328
00:52:52.567 --> 00:52:53.818
Get off.

329
00:52:59.824 --> 00:53:01.327
My master said I would meet you.

330
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.082
He said our paths would merge.

331
00:53:12.087 --> 00:53:13.506
You're the one Khalar Zym seeks.

332
00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:15.508
I know nothing about it.

333
00:53:16.009 --> 00:53:17.343
Those were his men chasing you.

334
00:53:17.426 --> 00:53:19.595
They attacked our monastery.

335
00:53:23.892 --> 00:53:27.021
So, will you escort me to Hyrkania?

336
00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.485
We will wait for Khalar.

337
00:53:33.568 --> 00:53:35.862
We? There is no we.

338
00:53:36.863 --> 00:53:39.033
I will go to Hyrkania
as my master instructed.

339
00:53:40.993 --> 00:53:43.704
I said, we will wait.

340
00:53:43.788 --> 00:53:46.707
I said, I will go to Hyrkania.

341
00:53:53.839 --> 00:53:55.091
Why must I be tied up?

342
00:53:55.175 --> 00:53:56.884
Keep quiet and do as you're told.

343
00:53:57.385 --> 00:53:59.887
What are you going to do with him?

344
00:54:03.684 --> 00:54:05.936
I will wait for him to awaken.

345
00:54:07.395 --> 00:54:09.272
I wanna look him in the eyes
when I kill him.

346
00:54:13.276 --> 00:54:14.319
Do you have a name?

347
00:54:15.071 --> 00:54:17.865
My name is Tamara Amaliat Jorvi Karushan.

348
00:54:20.867 --> 00:54:22.328
And yours is?

349
00:54:22.744 --> 00:54:24.163
Conan.

350
00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:25.581
Conan.

351
00:54:26.915 --> 00:54:28.000
That's it?

352
00:54:28.626 --> 00:54:29.919
How many names do I need?

353
00:54:38.052 --> 00:54:40.806
Why would you save me only to tie me up?

354
00:54:46.061 --> 00:54:48.146
Khalar's a hard man to find.

355
00:54:48.856 --> 00:54:52.025
If I possess you, he must come to me.

356
00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:55.738
Possess? I am not your property.

357
00:54:55.821 --> 00:54:56.864
Go to sleep.

358
00:54:56.947 --> 00:54:58.574
I take instruction from no man.

359
00:54:59.617 --> 00:55:02.578
I am a monk of the Order of Shaipur.

360
00:55:03.662 --> 00:55:06.040
My people have never been conquered
by anyone the likes of you

361
00:55:06.124 --> 00:55:07.125
and I'm not about to...

362
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:08.585
Shh. Open.

363
00:55:09.377 --> 00:55:10.586
Ow. Ow!

364
00:55:11.254 --> 00:55:12.296
What?

365
00:55:13.047 --> 00:55:14.257
Quiet.

366
00:55:29.482 --> 00:55:33.193
Still no word from Remo and his scouts?

367
00:55:35.112 --> 00:55:41.201
They're gone. Remo will bring her here.
He has never disappointed me.

368
00:55:45.123 --> 00:55:47.583
The prize is near, Father.

369
00:55:48.251 --> 00:55:52.422
Soon you will have not only the mask,
but the blood to fill it.

370
00:55:56.468 --> 00:56:01.306
Marique, how your mother
yearned for the sorcery of Acheron.

371
00:56:03.559 --> 00:56:07.730
Imagine the secrets she will bring
back from the realm of the dead.

372
00:56:09.648 --> 00:56:15.571
And imagine how indomitable I will become
when she's once again by my side.

373
00:56:18.992 --> 00:56:20.243
Father...

374
00:56:21.619 --> 00:56:25.248
If the girl is lost,
or the ritual fails...

375
00:56:26.499 --> 00:56:28.460
It will not fail.

376
00:56:31.213 --> 00:56:32.965
If it does...

377
00:56:33.048 --> 00:56:34.466
It will not!

378
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:38.846
Your mother will return to me.

379
00:56:40.973 --> 00:56:45.311
My powers are growing inside of me.

380
00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.565
My mother's blood flows through me.

381
00:56:50.899 --> 00:56:54.903
I can help you uncover
the secrets of Acheron,

382
00:56:55.321 --> 00:56:56.615
just as she did.

383
00:56:56.698 --> 00:56:59.701
I can have them all kneeling before you,

384
00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:03.246
just as I kneel before you now.

385
00:57:08.585 --> 00:57:11.588
My Marique, you are like your mother.

386
00:57:13.132 --> 00:57:15.259
In so many ways.

387
00:57:23.601 --> 00:57:25.811
But you are not her.

388
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:31.859
Here. Drink.

389
00:57:38.616 --> 00:57:41.536
The truth this time.
Why does Khalar want you?

390
00:57:42.078 --> 00:57:45.874
I am a simple monk.
I am of no value to a warlord.

391
00:57:45.957 --> 00:57:47.376
She's lying!

392
00:57:50.546 --> 00:57:55.467
It's her blood. Her blood is special.
She's last of the bloodline of Acheron.

393
00:57:56.176 --> 00:57:57.218
Wait.

394
00:57:58.555 --> 00:58:00.306
Don't kill him yet.

395
00:58:04.727 --> 00:58:05.853
You are mistaken.

396
00:58:07.063 --> 00:58:09.023
That bloodline ended a thousand years ago.

397
00:58:09.106 --> 00:58:10.858
You lie, whore.

398
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:13.445
You can kill him now.

399
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:15.405
No, please.

400
00:58:16.739 --> 00:58:20.117
For her, I can get you a king's ransom.
It is true.

401
00:58:20.827 --> 00:58:24.665
Khalar has been searching
for a pureblood descendant for 20 years.

402
00:58:25.666 --> 00:58:26.917
Then we will wait for Khalar.

403
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.920
No. He will not come this way.

404
00:58:30.003 --> 00:58:32.715
He will be
in the Shaipur Ravine waiting for me.

405
00:58:33.506 --> 00:58:34.759
I can show you.

406
00:58:34.843 --> 00:58:36.469
Yeah.

407
00:58:40.264 --> 00:58:41.349
Come.

408
00:58:55.404 --> 00:58:56.698
Come on!

409
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.807
You see? I speak the truth.

410
00:59:23.518 --> 00:59:27.731
If you want, he will give
your weight in gold for this woman.

411
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:32.485
I will arrange everything.
I will deliver the message.

412
00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:35.071
Yes, you will.

413
01:00:18.867 --> 01:00:20.327
Remo returns.

414
01:00:32.548 --> 01:00:34.550
What does it say?

415
01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.974
"The Shaipur Outpost at midday.

416
01:00:41.808 --> 01:00:43.393
Come alone."

417
01:00:49.524 --> 01:00:50.860
It's hers.

418
01:01:42.622 --> 01:01:44.582
You're bold, Northerner.

419
01:01:47.877 --> 01:01:50.880
I admire courage, even when it's foolish.

420
01:01:56.719 --> 01:01:57.805
Your reward.

421
01:01:58.513 --> 01:02:01.433
- I do not want your gold.
- No?

422
01:02:01.891 --> 01:02:02.934
Then what?

423
01:02:04.645 --> 01:02:05.896
I want your head.

424
01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:08.399
Yes, of course you do.

425
01:02:11.735 --> 01:02:12.945
Kill him.

426
01:02:13.737 --> 01:02:15.531
Then bring me the pureblood.

427
01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:32.091
Conan!

428
01:05:26.439 --> 01:05:27.524
Come on!

429
01:05:47.295 --> 01:05:48.754
Who are you?

430
01:05:49.172 --> 01:05:51.882
You left me behind to watch my father die.

431
01:05:54.968 --> 01:05:56.137
Ah.

432
01:05:58.681 --> 01:05:59.974
Cimmerian.

433
01:06:04.438 --> 01:06:07.649
That was your chance, boy.
You won't get another.

434
01:06:11.946 --> 01:06:14.531
Wouldn't your father be ashamed of you?

435
01:06:46.522 --> 01:06:47.565
Yeah.

436
01:07:20.267 --> 01:07:21.393
Hmm.

437
01:07:24.896 --> 01:07:26.357
Oh, come on!

438
01:07:47.378 --> 01:07:48.962
Huh? Boy?

439
01:08:01.685 --> 01:08:02.769
Run!

440
01:08:05.439 --> 01:08:06.440
No!

441
01:08:15.866 --> 01:08:17.910
By Mitra, jump!

442
01:08:59.662 --> 01:09:01.497
I had him.

443
01:09:08.588 --> 01:09:10.257
Artus, I had him.

444
01:09:10.924 --> 01:09:12.217
The gods are cruel.

445
01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:16.053
Blast the gods. This was not their doing.

446
01:09:19.016 --> 01:09:20.851
It was I who failed.

447
01:09:22.019 --> 01:09:24.647
Are the tales they tell true?

448
01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:28.942
Does he have eyes red as fire
and a hide of golden scales?

449
01:09:29.026 --> 01:09:30.528
He is just a man.

450
01:09:30.945 --> 01:09:33.782
Then it is he who has failed.

451
01:09:33.865 --> 01:09:40.204
In fact, you may be the only man
in Hyboria to fight Khalar Zym and live.

452
01:09:40.288 --> 01:09:41.999
I need to go ashore and find him.

453
01:09:45.544 --> 01:09:48.338
After I go,
you must take her some place safe.

454
01:09:50.465 --> 01:09:52.091
She saved my life.

455
01:09:54.135 --> 01:09:55.513
For that, she has my loyalty.

456
01:09:55.596 --> 01:09:58.599
Then she has mine as well.

457
01:10:18.536 --> 01:10:19.996
Charming man, your friend.

458
01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.916
Most men are born to mother's milk.

459
01:10:22.999 --> 01:10:26.044
His first taste was of his mother's blood.

460
01:10:26.211 --> 01:10:28.004
He was battle born.

461
01:10:29.464 --> 01:10:30.841
So all he can do is kill?

462
01:10:30.924 --> 01:10:34.178
Oh, no. He has the heart of a king,

463
01:10:34.846 --> 01:10:37.014
the loyalty of a bloodhound.

464
01:10:37.889 --> 01:10:40.059
The Barbarians may be warriors,

465
01:10:40.142 --> 01:10:44.146
but they do not sacrifice their children
or enslave their allies

466
01:10:44.231 --> 01:10:47.024
like the priests and princes
of the civilized world.

467
01:10:48.275 --> 01:10:49.861
As for his manners...

468
01:10:49.944 --> 01:10:51.153
You look like a harlot.

469
01:10:51.237 --> 01:10:55.449
Yes. And apparently I'm the only woman
you've ever met who isn't one.

470
01:11:00.455 --> 01:11:02.457
Cimmerian women dress as warriors.

471
01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:06.794
Give her the leather and the armor.

472
01:11:08.296 --> 01:11:09.590
I think he likes you.

473
01:11:45.126 --> 01:11:47.337
Wake up! Wake up!

474
01:12:01.186 --> 01:12:02.603
All hands on deck!

475
01:12:18.537 --> 01:12:19.663
No!

476
01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:05.919
How many Cimmerians died
at the edge of that blade?

477
01:13:10.048 --> 01:13:11.300
Catch!

478
01:13:25.774 --> 01:13:27.734
Not bad.

479
01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:39.059
Farewell, good friend.

480
01:14:40.268 --> 01:14:42.020
May you find what you seek, Conan.

481
01:15:06.004 --> 01:15:10.049
It would seem our friend has
forgotten his map of the shoreline.

482
01:15:10.634 --> 01:15:11.801
You should take it to him.

483
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:14.220
And say goodbye.

484
01:15:19.518 --> 01:15:21.561
We set sail at dawn.

485
01:15:22.021 --> 01:15:23.730
Don't be late.

486
01:15:28.569 --> 01:15:31.071
You should go back to the ship.

487
01:15:31.155 --> 01:15:33.699
Do you ever wonder if our actions
serve some plan?

488
01:15:35.451 --> 01:15:38.621
Some purpose spun by the gods?

489
01:15:40.373 --> 01:15:43.752
Or are we all just doomed
to chaos and ruin?

490
01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:47.297
I know not and I care not.

491
01:15:48.548 --> 01:15:53.845
I live, I love, I slay, and I am content.

492
01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:09.508
Goodbye.

493
01:17:55.055 --> 01:17:56.349
Conan!

494
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:43.147
Ah. The elusive one. Welcome.

495
01:18:43.231 --> 01:18:48.278
You have made a mistake.
I am not the person you are looking for.

496
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.626
It is she.

497
01:19:02.292 --> 01:19:06.088
The pureblood descendant
of the Necromancers of Acheron.

498
01:19:56.683 --> 01:19:58.100
I'm looking for a thief.

499
01:19:58.184 --> 01:20:01.021
Argalon is a city of thieves.

500
01:20:01.689 --> 01:20:03.982
I'm looking for a thief named Ela-Shan.

501
01:20:04.607 --> 01:20:07.610
Who are you to ask, Barbarian?

502
01:20:10.822 --> 01:20:12.158
Stand down, you fools!

503
01:20:19.498 --> 01:20:21.834
Fast as Yezud,
he will gut you like a fish.

504
01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:27.882
I owe this man my life.

505
01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:32.345
Well, Ela-Shan,
you will have your chance to repay it.

506
01:20:34.347 --> 01:20:35.306
Come.

507
01:20:54.284 --> 01:20:55.536
This is madness.

508
01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.162
Breaking into Khalar Zym's fortress

509
01:20:57.246 --> 01:20:59.832
is like reaching under a sleeping dragon
to steal her eggs.

510
01:20:59.915 --> 01:21:01.542
Why go in?

511
01:21:02.502 --> 01:21:04.462
There's a woman inside.

512
01:21:08.549 --> 01:21:10.760
She must be really pretty.

513
01:21:27.236 --> 01:21:32.116
My mother wore this gown
on her wedding day. It flatters you.

514
01:21:34.493 --> 01:21:36.120
I'm not your mother.

515
01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:39.624
No? But you will be.

516
01:21:40.792 --> 01:21:44.045
Imagine that your body is a vessel.

517
01:21:44.128 --> 01:21:46.381
And your soul is the water that fills it.

518
01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:51.344
When your blood seeds the mask,
my father will empty you.

519
01:21:52.179 --> 01:21:53.847
Then I welcome death.

520
01:21:53.931 --> 01:21:57.935
Your death shall herald
a new age of Acheron.

521
01:21:59.269 --> 01:22:03.190
The spirits I raise
will melt flesh from the bones of kings.

522
01:22:03.274 --> 01:22:05.276
And my wife will make me a god,

523
01:22:05.359 --> 01:22:09.238
and we will cast all rivals
into oceans of blood.

524
01:22:16.455 --> 01:22:20.333
Please. I beg you one last time.
Do not do this. Let us turn back.

525
01:22:25.546 --> 01:22:26.630
Come on.

526
01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:44.525
Did you know
I met your Barbarian when he was a boy?

527
01:22:44.984 --> 01:22:47.445
That I took this sword from him?

528
01:22:48.654 --> 01:22:52.617
I'm told Cimmerian steel
is sharper and harder than any other,

529
01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:57.663
that when it cuts,
the pain is close to pleasure.

530
01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:02.377
I know that will please you.

531
01:23:11.762 --> 01:23:13.639
That was the last gate.

532
01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:16.642
I told you, you see?
I told you I can get you in.

533
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.319
You!

534
01:24:09.113 --> 01:24:11.408
A feast for my sword.

535
01:24:11.491 --> 01:24:14.118
No! A feast for the Dweller!

536
01:24:25.797 --> 01:24:26.840
Hey!

537
01:24:34.474 --> 01:24:36.351
Watch out!
No! No!

538
01:24:59.666 --> 01:25:01.085
Conan!

539
01:25:01.168 --> 01:25:02.211
Conan, watch out!

540
01:25:14.223 --> 01:25:16.475
No! Hey!

541
01:25:19.937 --> 01:25:21.106
Conan!

542
01:25:41.418 --> 01:25:42.795
Oh, shit!

543
01:25:47.383 --> 01:25:49.302
- Get me out of here!
- Use a key!

544
01:25:49.385 --> 01:25:51.470
- I can't! I dropped them!
- Then pick the lock!

545
01:25:51.554 --> 01:25:52.721
With what?

546
01:26:01.398 --> 01:26:02.899
Hey! Help me!

547
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:06.695
Careful! Be careful!

548
01:26:09.238 --> 01:26:10.407
Drop!

549
01:26:24.422 --> 01:26:26.382
Hey! Hey!

550
01:26:35.434 --> 01:26:37.102
Hurry up! Hurry up!

551
01:27:15.225 --> 01:27:17.936
Hey! Help me. Hey!

552
01:27:18.811 --> 01:27:19.938
Get me out of here!

553
01:27:20.022 --> 01:27:21.606
I'm dying! I'm gonna die!

554
01:27:27.821 --> 01:27:29.448
You scream like a woman.

555
01:27:33.494 --> 01:27:35.871
I think it's this way.
Hey, hey, wait for me.

556
01:27:53.515 --> 01:27:56.601
They are taking her
to the Skull Cave.

557
01:27:56.685 --> 01:27:59.020
I see no more locks down there.

558
01:28:00.146 --> 01:28:01.816
Your debt is paid.

559
01:28:04.276 --> 01:28:06.028
Farewell, my friend.

560
01:28:08.488 --> 01:28:11.366
If you ever need me again,
you know where to find me!

561
01:29:16.477 --> 01:29:20.731
As a victorious Barbarian sword
once shattered the mask,

562
01:29:20.814 --> 01:29:24.485
so shall a vanquished
Barbarian sword revive it.

563
01:30:28.426 --> 01:30:29.595
Pureblood.

564
01:30:46.529 --> 01:30:47.739
Behold

565
01:30:49.324 --> 01:30:50.700
and despair

566
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:54.036
your new master.

567
01:31:05.048 --> 01:31:06.549
Maliva!

568
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:08.970
My queen!

569
01:31:10.054 --> 01:31:12.306
Hear my call!

570
01:32:38.313 --> 01:32:39.606
Barbarian.

571
01:32:39.689 --> 01:32:41.691
I don't like you anymore.

572
01:33:14.017 --> 01:33:15.352
Jump to the ledge!

573
01:33:19.063 --> 01:33:21.399
Get up! Hide!

574
01:33:33.828 --> 01:33:35.164
That was your chance, Khalar.

575
01:33:35.373 --> 01:33:36.416
You won't get another.

576
01:34:14.956 --> 01:34:16.666
I smell you.

577
01:34:39.732 --> 01:34:40.941
Conan!

578
01:34:59.335 --> 01:35:01.337
Barbarian!

579
01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:05.300
You're too late. She belongs to me!

580
01:36:01.858 --> 01:36:02.943
Die!

581
01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:17.084
Get out! Tamara, run! Run!

582
01:36:42.569 --> 01:36:47.573
I'm going to kill you
with your own father's blade.

583
01:36:58.168 --> 01:37:00.086
You are not worthy of my father's sword.

584
01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.431
Come.

585
01:37:13.809 --> 01:37:15.560
Come on.

586
01:37:35.123 --> 01:37:36.332
Get up.

587
01:38:14.164 --> 01:38:15.748
Go! Go!

588
01:38:17.334 --> 01:38:18.543
Run!

589
01:38:44.529 --> 01:38:49.368
Barbarian! I'm coming for you!

590
01:38:53.538 --> 01:38:54.706
Tamara!

591
01:39:19.399 --> 01:39:20.608
Maliva!

592
01:39:23.737 --> 01:39:25.906
I summon you here.

593
01:39:33.371 --> 01:39:34.791
His witch possesses me.

594
01:39:35.249 --> 01:39:36.668
I can't fight her.

595
01:39:36.751 --> 01:39:37.960
No!

596
01:39:39.128 --> 01:39:40.587
Drop me, Conan, please!

597
01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:46.886
Once again, the little Cimmerian boy
is caught holding a chain.

598
01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:48.305
Let me go!

599
01:39:51.266 --> 01:39:52.392
Let me go!

600
01:39:53.268 --> 01:39:54.311
No!

601
01:39:57.439 --> 01:39:58.524
Boy.

602
01:39:58.607 --> 01:40:01.359
There is no shame in kneeling before me.

603
01:40:02.736 --> 01:40:04.029
Conan, please!

604
01:40:04.112 --> 01:40:05.823
She will live forever.

605
01:40:05.906 --> 01:40:07.490
Drop the chain.

606
01:40:08.325 --> 01:40:09.910
Let go of the chain, Conan.

607
01:40:09.993 --> 01:40:12.956
And let another die in your place?

608
01:40:14.623 --> 01:40:16.209
Like your father?

609
01:40:17.751 --> 01:40:18.836
Drop me!

610
01:40:18.919 --> 01:40:23.174
I warned him that one day

611
01:40:23.883 --> 01:40:26.345
I would become a god.

612
01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:36.981
And my father warned you, god or not...

613
01:40:39.524 --> 01:40:40.525
Let me go!

614
01:40:40.609 --> 01:40:41.693
...you will fall!

615
01:40:47.742 --> 01:40:51.912
Maliva!

616
01:41:15.396 --> 01:41:17.273
Give me your hand.

617
01:42:27.429 --> 01:42:29.139
Thank you for bringing me home.

618
01:42:29.682 --> 01:42:30.933
I know you have to leave.

619
01:42:31.016 --> 01:42:31.934
Live well, Tamara.

620
01:42:33.936 --> 01:42:35.729
Till we meet again.

621
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:58.024
<i>This sword we make</i>
<i>will be yours one day.</i>

622
01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:03.446
<i>But before you wield it,
you must understand it.</i>
