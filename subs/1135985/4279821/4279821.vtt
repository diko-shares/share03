1
00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:29.676
IAN: We open up against
Michigan in two weeks.

2
00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:34.101
Coach's got me hitting
the bench pretty hard.

3
00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.358
Shit. How much is a lot?

4
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.036
One... No, two.

5
00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.178
I'm putting up three hundy.

6
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.053
Well, let's see, Tasty.

7
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.227
Wow!

8
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.790
Um...

9
00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:16.042
Wow, you're really pretty.
I've never seen...

10
00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.258
No, stop it, stop it.

11
00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.551
Don't be so fucking desperate.
Come on, be a dick. Be cool.

12
00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:26.029
<i>MAN IMITATING VAN DAMME: Don't be
a pussy. Tell her she's an ugly skank.</i>

13
00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.867
Yeah.

14
00:01:29.868 --> 00:01:31.725
Not bad.

15
00:01:32.427 --> 00:01:34.219
I've seen better.

16
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.905
Yeah, whatever.

17
00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:46.346
Coach's got us running two-a-days,
so I gotta bounce.

18
00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:12.170
Miss Tasty? How did you get here?

19
00:02:12.393 --> 00:02:14.414
Shh!

20
00:03:30.084 --> 00:03:32.484
Ian, wake up, faggot. Judge rolls in 20,

21
00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:34.532
so if you want a ride to work
you better get your poop in a group.

22
00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:38.212
- Okay, I'll be right down.
- No. Now, Clay Aiken.

23
00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:39.939
Hey...

24
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.531
- Ow! Cut it out.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

25
00:03:42.532 --> 00:03:44.644
Shut up! I'm trying to sleep.

26
00:03:44.645 --> 00:03:47.844
Hey, sorry, Big D. Just go back to sleep.

27
00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:50.211
- You, get up.
- Give me a minute.

28
00:03:50.212 --> 00:03:51.427
What are you hiding?

29
00:03:51.428 --> 00:03:53.443
You got a big fattie under there, don't you?

30
00:03:53.444 --> 00:03:58.181
Yeah, you do. You're stroking it, too.
Oh! What the F?

31
00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:00.066
Good. My boys are all here.

32
00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:02.017
- Dad, Ian's free...
- Can it, Rex.

33
00:04:02.018 --> 00:04:05.379
Your pop's got a bombshell to drop,
so ears open.

34
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.290
Last night,
your old man popped the question.

35
00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:11.042
Show them, Karen.

36
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:15.844
I'm so happy.

37
00:04:17.443 --> 00:04:19.873
Hey, way to go!

38
00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:23.201
Ian, you wanna get off your duff
and come over here and give Karen a hug?

39
00:04:23.202 --> 00:04:24.256
Um...

40
00:04:24.257 --> 00:04:27.810
- Yeah, Ian, get up. You're being rude.
- Can we do that later?

41
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:31.654
- Damn it, Ian, get up...
- No, no, honey. It's okay.

42
00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:36.580
We have to give him time
to get used to the idea.

43
00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:39.199
IAN'S DAD: Karen?
REX: Are you okay?

44
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.152
IAN'S DAD: Karen? Karen, honey?
REX: You okay?

45
00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:42.751
Sweetheart?

46
00:04:42.752 --> 00:04:44.606
What smells like jizz?

47
00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:52.799
Let's go! Kick it in the ass, dildo!

48
00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:05.634
Come on, get in. Get in!

49
00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:14.851
REX: You suck!

50
00:05:16.095 --> 00:05:19.808
Okay, seriously.
Quit being such a fag and get in.

51
00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:26.013
<i>Never go down
So let's get it up</i>

52
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:33.946
Ian, I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want a straight answer.

53
00:05:34.142 --> 00:05:35.997
- You queer?
- What?

54
00:05:35.998 --> 00:05:38.428
- God damn it! I knew it!
- I didn't say anything.

55
00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:40.701
Exactly. If someone asks you
if you're a pole smoker,

56
00:05:40.702 --> 00:05:44.060
you just deny it, straight off.
No pause, no farting around.

57
00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:45.180
Rex, I'm not gay.

58
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:48.251
Ian, you're 18,
and you've never had a girlfriend.

59
00:05:48.252 --> 00:05:50.909
That's how people wind up getting gay,
you know.

60
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.860
I don't think that's really how it happens.

61
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:55.228
Is that not how it happens?
So tell me how it happens, expert.

62
00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.628
Fucking cock expert. Cockspert.

63
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.612
Hey, what do you like better,
the shaft or the balls?

64
00:05:59.613 --> 00:06:01.659
That's gross.
I don't know why you're talking about it.

65
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.899
Look, every guy's got a fantasy
about another guy,

66
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.547
but you got to bury that shit way down.
This is America, God damn it.

67
00:06:07.548 --> 00:06:11.451
There is...
There is a girl that I've been kind of...

68
00:06:11.452 --> 00:06:14.299
All right, I'm listening.
Where'd you meet her?

69
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.379
On the... Online.

70
00:06:17.436 --> 00:06:20.858
<i>What? For fuck's sake, Ian,
don't you watch Dateline?</i>

71
00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:25.114
She's probably a guy. Some fat old dude
who wants to ram you in the tailpipe.

72
00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:29.209
But you'd love that, wouldn't you?
'Cause you're a homo.

73
00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:42.042
REX: Try not to come home any gayer
than you are now.

74
00:06:48.697 --> 00:06:53.240
<i>Hey</i>

75
00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:56.664
<i>What's your favorite song?</i>

76
00:06:56.665 --> 00:07:00.061
<i>Maybe we could hum along</i>

77
00:07:00.537 --> 00:07:07.326
<i>Well, I think you're smart,
you sweet thing</i>

78
00:07:07.736 --> 00:07:12.987
<i>Tell me your name,
I'm dying here</i>

79
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:21.684
<i>Got you where I want you</i>

80
00:07:22.136 --> 00:07:24.244
<i>Yeah</i>

81
00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:37.590
- Hey, Becca. How are you?
- I'm good. I'm fine. Whatever.

82
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:41.622
Hey, Becca.
Looks like you had a long, nasty night.

83
00:07:41.623 --> 00:07:45.366
<i>- Ron and Ian want the four-one-uno.
- Whatever. You guys are gross.</i>

84
00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:50.420
- I'm not gross. I didn't say anything.
- Okay, who's going on coupon rounds?

85
00:07:52.214 --> 00:07:56.059
- No, Becca, I did it yesterday.
- Please, Ian.

86
00:07:57.559 --> 00:07:59.896
I love you so much.

87
00:08:01.622 --> 00:08:05.433
IAN: Hello. This is a coupon for six free...
No? Okay. Sorry. Donuts? No.

88
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:07.412
- Six free donuts with the Bandito's Dozen.
- Thanks.

89
00:08:07.413 --> 00:08:09.619
You're welcome. Sorry.

90
00:08:10.293 --> 00:08:12.755
Excuse me. Do you know where the Gap is?

91
00:08:12.756 --> 00:08:17.108
- It's just past the movie theater.
- Thanks, man.

92
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.003
Yeah, real funny.

93
00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:28.244
Free donuts, free coupons.

94
00:08:28.245 --> 00:08:31.160
TIFFANY: Felicia. How's it fitting, hon?

95
00:08:42.068 --> 00:08:46.063
Well, you look nice.

96
00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:48.242
You know, sweetie,
there's still time to have your boobs done

97
00:08:48.243 --> 00:08:49.426
before my wedding.

98
00:08:49.427 --> 00:08:51.857
Darren and I already discussed them,
and he said he'd pay for it.

99
00:08:51.858 --> 00:08:55.570
I mean, he's a dentist,
so it's totally not a big deal.

100
00:08:56.209 --> 00:08:58.290
Excuse me, do you have a pair of scissors?

101
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.338
Oh! Sure, sweetie. Do you have a stringie?

102
00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:03.796
Oh, no. I was just hoping
you could slit my wrists for me quickly.

103
00:09:03.797 --> 00:09:07.125
My husband killed himself last Christmas.

104
00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:11.825
I am so sorry. I was just...

105
00:09:11.826 --> 00:09:16.912
Hello. This is a coupon
for six free donuts. Donuts?

106
00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:23.089
Oh, my God! You look so hot in that.

107
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.968
Hey, sweetheart, listen.
Please don't take this the wrong way,

108
00:09:25.969 --> 00:09:27.888
but your whole trying too hard thing,

109
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:30.511
it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

110
00:09:30.512 --> 00:09:32.815
And I think you're better than that,
Kimberly.

111
00:09:32.816 --> 00:09:37.678
- But all I was saying was that...
- Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?

112
00:09:37.679 --> 00:09:39.664
I mean, Christ,
I'm out buying him clothes right now.

113
00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:43.439
He's 18 years old.
I don't have to do that shit anymore.

114
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.461
Look, Judy, listen, I'm sorry,
I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.

115
00:09:49.327 --> 00:09:52.975
Well, it's official, Lance,
your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

116
00:09:52.976 --> 00:09:55.247
What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

117
00:09:55.248 --> 00:09:58.093
No, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.

118
00:09:58.094 --> 00:10:00.879
All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

119
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.823
Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

120
00:10:03.824 --> 00:10:07.438
And whatever you do, man,
always wear a rubber. Christ.

121
00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:10.221
Nice. Always classy.

122
00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:14.513
Hey, come on, Lance, I didn't mean it like...
Come on, dawg.

123
00:10:17.357 --> 00:10:21.748
Hey, sir. I've got something yummy
for your little girl.

124
00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:28.010
Oh, my God. Excuse me! Sorry!

125
00:10:32.494 --> 00:10:36.396
- Ian? Oh, my God, dude, what happened?
- I don't know.

126
00:10:36.397 --> 00:10:38.763
Is there a cock and balls
on the front of me again?

127
00:10:38.764 --> 00:10:41.832
- Like a little tree trunk.
- IAN: Thank you.

128
00:10:42.254 --> 00:10:44.721
Oh, my God.

129
00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:50.764
- Whoa. You look pretty.
- God, shut up, Ian!

130
00:10:50.765 --> 00:10:54.571
What? I'm just saying,
you usually dress so... You look nice.

131
00:10:54.572 --> 00:10:56.875
Ian, why do you got to work the mouth
when you talk to us?

132
00:10:56.876 --> 00:11:00.298
- Yeah, Ian.
- Sorry, it's a... It's a habit.

133
00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:03.275
Hey, that girl you work with, Becca,
you gonna bring her to my party tonight?

134
00:11:03.276 --> 00:11:07.851
- Yeah, I asked her. She said no.
- Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.

135
00:11:07.852 --> 00:11:10.283
That's what you say about everyone.

136
00:11:10.284 --> 00:11:12.265
She made you wear
the fucking costume again, right?

137
00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:14.667
- You know, I don't mind...
- Dude, if you told her to fuck off,

138
00:11:14.668 --> 00:11:17.930
she'd be two knuckles deep right now
daydreaming about your big black cock.

139
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:19.145
FELICIA: Ian, do not listen to him.

140
00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:21.802
Okay, girls want a nice guy
who's gonna treat them well.

141
00:11:21.803 --> 00:11:23.433
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

142
00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:25.643
Look, all I'm saying is
everybody wants a challenge.

143
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:28.010
- Everybody wants...
- What they can't get. I know, I got it.

144
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:31.850
- That shit does not work.
- It works on you.

145
00:11:31.851 --> 00:11:34.221
No, it doesn't.

146
00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:39.624
Felicia!

147
00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:43.303
Balls! I got to go.
Evil cousin's spending the weekend.

148
00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:46.121
- Pretty cousin?
- Ian, she's the anti-Christ.

149
00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:49.800
- She's still super hot.
- Fuck you, too. See you.

150
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:51.240
So what happened with Becca?

151
00:11:51.241 --> 00:11:52.839
You been doing like I told you,
being a dick?

152
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.797
Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick.
I'd say... No, not really.

153
00:11:58.025 --> 00:11:59.975
I mean, you know,
I've sort of been practicing

154
00:11:59.976 --> 00:12:03.111
your whole being-a-dick thing
with this girl I met online.

155
00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:05.062
- And I get it, but I just...
- Thanks.

156
00:12:05.063 --> 00:12:06.888
I don't think I could do that for real.

157
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:08.968
Dude, sure you can.
I believe in you, you know.

158
00:12:08.969 --> 00:12:12.647
You just got to stop worrying
about being the good guy all the time.

159
00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:14.727
I mean, okay,
look at Andy and Randy over there.

160
00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:16.615
You think they care
what women think about them?

161
00:12:16.616 --> 00:12:19.014
They could give a fuck.

162
00:12:19.015 --> 00:12:21.702
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

163
00:12:21.703 --> 00:12:24.997
Hi. I'm collecting for
the underprivileged children of Ecuador.

164
00:12:24.998 --> 00:12:27.335
- Would you like to help?
- You wanna party?

165
00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:29.607
Um... I'm kind of working right now.

166
00:12:29.608 --> 00:12:31.910
- When are you done?
- Yeah, what are you doing after?

167
00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:33.478
I have a church thing tonight.

168
00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:35.397
- Kick ass, we'll come.
- Yeah, where is it?

169
00:12:35.398 --> 00:12:37.414
Is there gonna be
more hot snatch like you there?

170
00:12:37.415 --> 00:12:40.358
Those guys are total nards.
They never get anywhere.

171
00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:42.277
That's just 'cause they don't know
how to close.

172
00:12:42.278 --> 00:12:44.164
But they're ability to open
is fucking heroic.

173
00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:46.692
- Do you wear thong underpants?
- Do you want us to take our shirts off?

174
00:12:46.693 --> 00:12:48.422
- Where do you live?
- Is your mom hot, too?

175
00:12:48.423 --> 00:12:50.118
- Where do you live?
- What's your address?

176
00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:51.782
- Do you want us to come over?
- Do you like pizza?

177
00:12:51.783 --> 00:12:54.284
We've been to a motel.

178
00:12:57.126 --> 00:13:01.514
- Fuck off, donut.
- Rex, it's me.

179
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:03.939
What the fuck is this all about?

180
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.747
I broke the key off of our locker.
I couldn't get my clothes out.

181
00:13:07.748 --> 00:13:12.171
Stow that shit in the trunk.
Christ, you look like a Mexican butt-hole.

182
00:13:16.516 --> 00:13:18.439
REX: You suck.

183
00:13:21.156 --> 00:13:23.395
Becca? Hey.

184
00:13:23.396 --> 00:13:26.922
Wow, I didn't know
that you were coming over.

185
00:13:27.075 --> 00:13:32.100
Cool. I didn't even know
that you knew where I lived. I mean...

186
00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:34.723
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

187
00:13:34.724 --> 00:13:38.082
- So...
- Oh! It's a funny story. I broke...

188
00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:41.794
I broke my key off
and Ron let me borrow the...

189
00:13:41.795 --> 00:13:45.441
Anyway, so this is great.
You changed your mind.

190
00:13:45.442 --> 00:13:46.689
Now, the party, it doesn't start

191
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.048
- for a few hours.
- Actually, I was wondering if Dylan's here.

192
00:13:52.611 --> 00:13:55.042
- Dylan?
- Yeah. Is he here?

193
00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:57.409
- My 14-year-old brother Dylan?
- Yeah.

194
00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:02.241
- DYLAN: Nice underpants, Ian.
- Snap! Dang, that was funny.

195
00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.831
You know he's 14, right?

196
00:14:23.073 --> 00:14:27.230
Ian, dude, there's like 80 wet chicks here.
Get off your wallflower ass.

197
00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:30.142
- Are you smoking cigars now?
- Yes.

198
00:14:30.143 --> 00:14:33.343
- Hey, Lance. Tight party.
- Okay, rude.

199
00:14:33.344 --> 00:14:35.167
You can see
I'm having a conversation here.

200
00:14:35.168 --> 00:14:38.046
Now, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

201
00:14:38.047 --> 00:14:39.391
- Thank you.
- We're sorry.

202
00:14:39.392 --> 00:14:41.342
- Don't apologize to her.
- I'm sorry.

203
00:14:41.343 --> 00:14:42.847
Don't apologize to me.

204
00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:49.118
Hey, I'm gonna go see
who Felicia's talking to.

205
00:14:49.119 --> 00:14:51.326
No, dude, forget Felicia, okay?

206
00:14:51.327 --> 00:14:53.343
I know you guys are BFF and all that shit,

207
00:14:53.344 --> 00:14:55.678
but tonight's about getting that dick
a little daylight.

208
00:14:55.679 --> 00:14:57.695
Hey, Lindsay, sweetheart,
where you going?

209
00:14:57.696 --> 00:15:00.126
Come here, we're not done. Get in here.

210
00:15:00.127 --> 00:15:03.869
- You know my boy Ian?
- Yeah. No. I don't know.

211
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.964
- You used to be on my paper route.
- Okay, sure. My mom likes you.

212
00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:11.356
You know what else
about our boy Ian here?

213
00:15:11.357 --> 00:15:13.467
Ian is a bust-ass virgin.

214
00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:18.525
- I'm so sorry.
- He's fresh meat.

215
00:15:20.126 --> 00:15:23.292
Yeah. No, I'm pretty stoked.
I got into the University of Wisconsin,

216
00:15:23.293 --> 00:15:25.500
and I'm gonna go for veterinary medicine,
'cause that's where...

217
00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:27.900
- Are you gonna go to college?
- University of Boulder.

218
00:15:27.901 --> 00:15:29.596
It's a great party school.

219
00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:34.813
Oh, you know, I read that they have
a really great astronomy program.

220
00:15:34.814 --> 00:15:36.733
I don't know if that's
what you're going there for or...

221
00:15:36.734 --> 00:15:42.846
Because it's really high elevation,
and you can see the stars really well...

222
00:15:44.924 --> 00:15:46.715
Planets.

223
00:15:46.716 --> 00:15:50.138
Wow! A little tip action there.
That's really suggestive.

224
00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:53.306
I'm not saying that
you're gonna do that on my, well...

225
00:15:53.307 --> 00:15:56.123
There, what, you're gonna... Two in there.

226
00:15:57.212 --> 00:15:58.267
- Wow, you're really...
- FELICIA: Ian! Dude!

227
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:02.818
I'm... Could you excuse me for a second?

228
00:16:03.483 --> 00:16:06.778
- Hey!
- Hey! What up?

229
00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:10.457
- What are you doing in there, man?
- What're you doing out here, man?

230
00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:13.241
- I asked you first.
- Uh... Nothing.

231
00:16:13.242 --> 00:16:16.922
No, I just... I spilled beer on my shirt,
so then I had to...

232
00:16:16.923 --> 00:16:21.721
- I thought you had, like, a girl in there.
- Yeah, right. I wish.

233
00:16:21.722 --> 00:16:25.177
So, okay.
So, are your parents, like, still going

234
00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:27.257
to Dylan's motor-cross thing this weekend?

235
00:16:27.258 --> 00:16:28.889
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They all take off in the morning.

236
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.168
Okay. Awesome.

237
00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:35.031
'Cause my evil cousin is driving me nuts,
so, I don't know,

238
00:16:35.032 --> 00:16:38.169
you think, like, maybe I could hang
at your place this weekend?

239
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.792
Yeah. Yeah, like a sleepover or something.
It'll be fun.

240
00:16:40.793 --> 00:16:47.128
Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
Hey, I have a secret.

241
00:16:48.185 --> 00:16:53.141
- Look at you acting like such a girl.
- I know, I know. Okay, okay. Here it is.

242
00:16:54.232 --> 00:16:59.064
I have a crush on someone, a boy, a guy.

243
00:16:59.065 --> 00:17:01.624
Yeah? Well, who is it?

244
00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:04.375
Come on, you know me better than anyone.
I bet you know who it is.

245
00:17:04.376 --> 00:17:06.549
Come on, guess.

246
00:17:07.703 --> 00:17:09.462
Um...

247
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.733
I think I know.

248
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.243
I'm kidding. Oh, God! I got you.
You're so easy. You're so easy!

249
00:17:28.406 --> 00:17:31.445
- You're my best friend.
- I know, and you're my best friend.

250
00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:35.922
That's why it's funny that we would kiss,
because we wouldn't.

251
00:17:37.334 --> 00:17:41.366
<i>So who is it? Who's the lucky caballero?</i>

252
00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:43.958
Um... Nobody.

253
00:17:43.959 --> 00:17:48.314
- Nobody?
- I... I was kidding, too.

254
00:17:48.566 --> 00:17:50.644
- That is funny.
- It's hilarious.

255
00:17:50.645 --> 00:17:53.593
- That is so funny.
- That is so funny.

256
00:17:53.653 --> 00:17:55.411
Oh! I...

257
00:17:55.412 --> 00:17:56.435
- Oh, you got...
- Yeah.

258
00:17:56.436 --> 00:17:58.930
- All right. So...
- Hey!

259
00:17:58.931 --> 00:18:00.922
Okay.

260
00:18:05.908 --> 00:18:07.700
Harsh.

261
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:20.626
- Hey, babe, you wanna party?
- I'm at a party.

262
00:18:20.627 --> 00:18:22.739
RANDY: Do you wanna make out with us?

263
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.828
ANDY: Why don't you take a picture, Ian?

264
00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:26.549
Yeah, and post it on
Totalfuckingawesomeness. com.

265
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.530
Backslash-we-rule!

266
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:29.714
RANDY: Where'd you come up with that?

267
00:18:29.715 --> 00:18:35.282
- Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
- You just did.

268
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.425
- Can I ask you another question?
- You just did again.

269
00:18:37.426 --> 00:18:41.138
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

270
00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:44.946
- Dude, where you going?
- Dude, come on. Be a buddy.

271
00:18:44.947 --> 00:18:49.904
- I'm... All right, all right.
- You got to get over the monkey.

272
00:18:49.905 --> 00:18:53.969
Where do you guys get the confidence to,
like, hit on every girl you see?

273
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.552
- 'Cause we're the shit.
- Yeah, you oughts to know that, bitch.

274
00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:01.494
- So where's Felicia?
- Fel-ate-cha. Yeah.

275
00:19:01.745 --> 00:19:05.655
- She's in...
- Fe-lay-cha! You banging her?

276
00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:07.377
We're just friends.

277
00:19:07.378 --> 00:19:09.840
- I'm uncircumcised.
- GIRL: Fuck off!

278
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:11.632
Wait, I thought you took her to prom.

279
00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:15.159
Yeah,
but it was a just-friends kind of thing.

280
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.846
You should bang her. We would.

281
00:19:20.847 --> 00:19:22.446
ANDY: Dude, we would bang her so hard.

282
00:19:22.447 --> 00:19:24.592
Yeah, tell her we'll bang her for you
if you're not into it.

283
00:19:24.593 --> 00:19:25.999
Yeah. Hard.

284
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.207
- With our dicks!
- Yeah, our dicks are huge.

285
00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:29.231
RANDY: You could see them from space!

286
00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:32.527
- What's up?
- What's up?

287
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.242
I'll call you from nationals.

288
00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:45.869
- BECCA: Say it.
- You're my little donut girl.

289
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.391
- Bye, sexy.
- Yo, Ian.

290
00:19:53.807 --> 00:19:58.163
- You want to smell my finger?
- Yeah, okay.

291
00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:04.044
Are you sure you got the right hole?

292
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.231
Awesome.

293
00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:24.946
Hmm... '69.

294
00:20:31.437 --> 00:20:33.164
Whoa.

295
00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.473
Don't puss out. Be cool.

296
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.107
I don't know.

297
00:20:48.108 --> 00:20:54.450
That is a long drive, my sugar biscuit!

298
00:20:55.883 --> 00:20:59.410
Sugar biscuit? God, I suck at this.

299
00:21:10.283 --> 00:21:12.138
Holy buckets.

300
00:21:13.802 --> 00:21:16.105
She wants me to give her the D.

301
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.185
<i>Well, honey</i>

302
00:21:18.186 --> 00:21:19.208
<i>What ya got, Mr. Mans?</i>

303
00:21:19.209 --> 00:21:20.649
<i>I got a lot of money</i>

304
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.568
<i>I don't see no keys in my hands</i>

305
00:21:22.569 --> 00:21:25.418
<i>I just wanna nasty girl</i>

306
00:21:26.665 --> 00:21:28.998
<i>Now tell me, is that nasty girl you?</i>

307
00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:30.216
<i>Do you like what you see?</i>

308
00:21:30.217 --> 00:21:36.583
<i>Could you be my nasty girl
and let me do that dirty dance with you?</i>

309
00:21:36.584 --> 00:21:39.271
<i>I can love you long time</i>

310
00:21:51.817 --> 00:21:55.591
<i>I like 'em all in shapes and sizes</i>

311
00:21:55.592 --> 00:21:58.791
<i>And it don't make no difference to me</i>

312
00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:03.334
<i>If you're short, tall, big or small
Long if there ain't no big surprises</i>

313
00:22:03.335 --> 00:22:06.154
<i>Chances are you'll suit me to a T</i>

314
00:22:09.222 --> 00:22:12.269
Dad, what did you do with my helmet?

315
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:37.666
Ian, honey,
I made you some tollhouse cookies.

316
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.843
I'll just leave these here for you.

317
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.338
I'll get them later.

318
00:22:43.493 --> 00:22:46.506
There's $40 in the cow for fun money,

319
00:22:46.788 --> 00:22:50.729
so be safe and sorry I didn't knock.

320
00:22:51.459 --> 00:22:55.236
Anytime. It's your home now.

321
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.401
KAREN: Oh, dear.

322
00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:02.946
- Dude.
- Hey.

323
00:23:02.947 --> 00:23:06.213
What is going on with you?
You bought rubbers?

324
00:23:06.563 --> 00:23:09.609
- How did you know that?
- It's on Russ Miller's blog.

325
00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:15.014
Jesus! That was, like, 11 minutes ago.

326
00:23:15.015 --> 00:23:17.795
What's the deal? Dude.

327
00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:20.707
IAN: She wants me to meet her tonight
at the Big Boy in Knoxville.

328
00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:22.978
Seriously, dude, pack your shit.
We're going to Knoxville.

329
00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:25.057
No. Stop it. Put these back.

330
00:23:25.058 --> 00:23:26.818
This is the type of girl who has...

331
00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:29.729
She has it shaved into a landing strip.

332
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.136
I can't deal with a landing strip.

333
00:23:31.137 --> 00:23:33.760
Okay, dude, you don't know that. I mean,
she could have anything under there.

334
00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:38.241
There could be a little Hitler
or just a full, nasty Chewbacca.

335
00:23:38.242 --> 00:23:42.017
You know, she doesn't even want me.
She wants him.

336
00:23:43.074 --> 00:23:46.753
I'm sorry. This is good. This is fine.

337
00:23:46.754 --> 00:23:49.024
I mean, that looks like you. Like the eyes.

338
00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:51.520
Tasty's probably a guy, anyway.

339
00:23:51.521 --> 00:23:54.367
Maybe. But what if she's not?

340
00:23:54.368 --> 00:23:58.398
You know, I mean, look, you've already
opened, and I could help you close.

341
00:23:58.434 --> 00:23:59.841
We just need one thing.

342
00:24:05.057 --> 00:24:09.566
Ian, just look at this.
I mean, you roll up in a '69 GTO,

343
00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:12.158
she's gonna drop an egg right there
in the Big Boy parking lot.

344
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.726
Hey, Ian, come give me a hand with this.

345
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:18.623
Here. Strap that end down. Tight.

346
00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:22.369
- The cord's too short.
- Put a little sack into it, powder puff.

347
00:24:25.439 --> 00:24:28.161
- All right. Thanks, little brother.
- Yeah.

348
00:24:28.162 --> 00:24:30.083
- Hey, Ian.
- Yeah.

349
00:24:30.143 --> 00:24:32.288
Did I hear something
about you wanting to borrow my car?

350
00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:35.322
No, no, it's fine. Thanks. Thank you.

351
00:24:35.806 --> 00:24:37.698
You sure?

352
00:24:38.336 --> 00:24:41.949
You're my little brother, Ian.
All you gotta do is ask.

353
00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:45.342
Okay.

354
00:24:45.758 --> 00:24:48.797
Could I use The Judge this weekend?

355
00:24:48.798 --> 00:24:49.884
Ow!

356
00:24:52.893 --> 00:24:57.402
Fuck-stick, I wouldn't let you drive
The Judge if it was parked on my shnuts.

357
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.036
- REX: Let's go, Dad.
- What a dick.

358
00:25:03.037 --> 00:25:05.180
You should take his car just on principle.

359
00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:07.100
What do you want me to do, you know?

360
00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:09.692
I mean, I doubt I can hot-wire it,
since I don't even know what that means.

361
00:25:09.693 --> 00:25:11.779
What are you doing?

362
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:17.755
No. Lance, no! Put it back.
Did you just hear him? Please.

363
00:25:17.756 --> 00:25:20.156
Come here, we're gonna have a talk.

364
00:25:20.157 --> 00:25:21.820
She's only nine short hours away.

365
00:25:21.821 --> 00:25:24.187
We're gonna head down there tonight
and you're gonna pound on that va-J.

366
00:25:24.188 --> 00:25:26.875
Who's gonna pound on it? Say it.
Ian's gonna pound on it.

367
00:25:26.876 --> 00:25:29.498
We're back tomorrow
before Rex even knows the car is gone.

368
00:25:29.499 --> 00:25:32.059
Now, listen, these girls at Madison are
gonna be fucking at a college level.

369
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.842
I need you ready for that.

370
00:25:34.843 --> 00:25:37.432
Wait! Put it... Put it back.

371
00:25:37.498 --> 00:25:39.225
Back here.

372
00:25:52.219 --> 00:25:56.281
For God's sake. You two rump rangers
couldn't wait five minutes?

373
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.409
Shit.

374
00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:25.176
- Shit!
- Fuck!

375
00:26:25.177 --> 00:26:28.277
I told her she could stay here this weekend.

376
00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:31.543
What the hell?
Why are you driving Rex's car?

377
00:26:31.544 --> 00:26:33.631
I thought me and...

378
00:26:34.936 --> 00:26:37.559
- Are you bitching out on me?
- No.

379
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.775
- No.
- No.

380
00:26:38.776 --> 00:26:41.687
Good. Well, then where are we going?

381
00:26:41.688 --> 00:26:45.086
Um... Knoxville, Tennessee.

382
00:26:45.913 --> 00:26:47.351
Okay. I'm gonna go tell my mom.

383
00:26:47.352 --> 00:26:51.223
Okay. Are you gonna... Awesome.

384
00:26:51.224 --> 00:26:52.726
Dude, what the fuck?

385
00:26:52.727 --> 00:26:54.550
- I don't want her along.
- Really?

386
00:26:54.551 --> 00:26:56.694
You don't want to bring Yoko
on your sex trip?

387
00:26:56.695 --> 00:26:58.997
Yeah, no shit.
She's always cock-blocking you.

388
00:26:58.998 --> 00:27:01.525
No, she isn't. She doesn't even have a...

389
00:27:01.526 --> 00:27:03.703
Okay, twat blocking.

390
00:27:03.704 --> 00:27:04.822
Professor.

391
00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:05.846
FELICIA'S MOM: When will you
be coming back?

392
00:27:05.847 --> 00:27:07.222
No, tomorrow.

393
00:27:07.223 --> 00:27:10.230
- FELICIA'S MOM: When?
- No. Bye! God.

394
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:13.013
FELICIA'S MOM: You guys
drive safe now. Bye!

395
00:27:13.014 --> 00:27:15.286
So, what's in Tennessee?

396
00:27:15.287 --> 00:27:18.617
My grandma has got some cancer.

397
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.756
- Grammy K?
- IAN: She's fine.

398
00:27:20.757 --> 00:27:24.371
She's gonna live forever. Well, a long time.

399
00:27:24.919 --> 00:27:26.741
It's, you know... I mean, what is it called?

400
00:27:26.742 --> 00:27:28.789
- It's foot cancer.
- She's got a little foot cancer.

401
00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.574
She'll be hopping around in no time.

402
00:27:31.702 --> 00:27:34.260
So what's she doing in Tennessee?

403
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:38.294
Oh! Um... Well, there's this kick-ass
cancer center there.

404
00:27:38.295 --> 00:27:42.130
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's like... It's famous.

405
00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:44.722
- Yeah.
- So if you ever get any cancer,

406
00:27:44.723 --> 00:27:49.043
you should totally check it out.

407
00:27:50.132 --> 00:27:51.891
I would.

408
00:27:54.099 --> 00:27:58.903
LANCE: So you want I-80 East and then
65 goes all the way through Indiana.

409
00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:01.618
- So how's it feel?
- IAN: What?

410
00:28:01.619 --> 00:28:06.040
I don't know, breaking the rules,
talking some shit, driving The Judge?

411
00:28:06.548 --> 00:28:07.763
It feels pretty good.

412
00:28:07.764 --> 00:28:09.747
<i>I'm feeling rough, I'm feeling raw</i>

413
00:28:09.748 --> 00:28:12.467
<i>I'm in the prime of my life</i>

414
00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:21.780
<i>Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives</i>

415
00:28:25.489 --> 00:28:30.261
<i>This is our decision
To live fast and die young</i>

416
00:28:30.322 --> 00:28:35.670
<i>We've got the vision
Now let's have some fun</i>

417
00:28:37.361 --> 00:28:40.277
<i>I said, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

418
00:28:43.665 --> 00:28:45.904
This dude wants to race.

419
00:28:46.864 --> 00:28:48.209
Let's go, ladies.

420
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.865
Lance! Cut it out!
Come on, you don't know who's in there.

421
00:28:50.866 --> 00:28:54.896
Dude, I don't care if fucking Steve McQueen's
zombie corpse is in that car.

422
00:28:54.897 --> 00:28:57.840
I refuse to be embarrassed by a car
that looks like a Trapper Keeper.

423
00:28:57.841 --> 00:29:00.560
I am not racing in my brother's car.

424
00:29:00.848 --> 00:29:03.501
IAN: Holy shit.

425
00:29:03.823 --> 00:29:05.742
What the hell is that?

426
00:29:05.743 --> 00:29:07.502
Whoa!

427
00:29:07.567 --> 00:29:09.616
Looks like a Nachos BellGrande.

428
00:29:09.617 --> 00:29:11.311
And a chalupa!

429
00:29:11.312 --> 00:29:12.687
Medium Coke!

430
00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:15.086
Go right!

431
00:29:15.087 --> 00:29:17.294
FELICIA: Turn the wipers on!
IAN: They are on.

432
00:29:17.295 --> 00:29:18.925
FELICIA: They're not working!

433
00:29:18.926 --> 00:29:22.323
IAN: Please, don't yell at me.
I'm doing the best I can.

434
00:29:22.575 --> 00:29:24.014
- Winnebago!
- IAN: Where?

435
00:29:24.015 --> 00:29:25.133
Winnebago! Winnebago!

436
00:29:33.008 --> 00:29:34.318
Oh, my God, are you all right?

437
00:29:39.758 --> 00:29:43.372
Yeah, nobody offer to help.
I got this under control.

438
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:54.766
- Are you all right?
- Do I look like I'm all right? Fuck!

439
00:29:56.302 --> 00:30:01.651
You know what might make you feel better?
Putting 40 on pump two.

440
00:30:15.437 --> 00:30:17.065
Hey.

441
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.809
- Another one for the collection.
- Aw! Cool. Thanks.

442
00:30:26.763 --> 00:30:28.490
What?

443
00:30:33.099 --> 00:30:36.234
It's okay, Brandy. It's okay, baby, don't cry.

444
00:30:36.235 --> 00:30:37.930
Lance, what are you doing?

445
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:39.850
Dude, you should be ashamed of yourself,

446
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:44.202
because I'm just trying to show
another human being a little compassion.

447
00:30:44.203 --> 00:30:46.224
And my dick.

448
00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:54.442
What have you got?

449
00:30:54.443 --> 00:30:57.456
Hey, kid, where you from?

450
00:30:58.154 --> 00:31:03.404
- I'm from Chicago, I mean, outside Chicago.
- Are you two married. No?

451
00:31:04.106 --> 00:31:10.247
<i>- No, we're just friends. We're amigos.
- Oh! You make a good couple.</i>

452
00:31:10.248 --> 00:31:13.543
She's pretty. Marry that girl.

453
00:31:13.544 --> 00:31:16.942
You kids want to help yourself
to a can of Purple?

454
00:31:17.001 --> 00:31:21.476
- Purple sounds great, Ian. Purple?
- Yeah, I can go...

455
00:31:23.592 --> 00:31:27.079
- You ever had a peppermint fatty?
- No. Let's have that.

456
00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.582
See how that shoe fits.

457
00:31:32.263 --> 00:31:34.852
That is curiously strong.

458
00:31:35.433 --> 00:31:38.023
I feel like my dick just got bar mitzvahed.

459
00:31:38.024 --> 00:31:40.455
It actually says Purple Soda.

460
00:31:44.999 --> 00:31:47.565
BRANDY: Bad boy.

461
00:31:51.398 --> 00:31:53.703
You like him, don't you?

462
00:31:56.327 --> 00:32:00.645
- What? Who?
- Lance. I mean, he's the crush, right?

463
00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:05.317
Oh, yeah! I like Lance, 'cause he's so hot.

464
00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:09.707
I wanna have his baby, he's... Whatever.

465
00:32:12.645 --> 00:32:15.555
RICK: Brandy!
FELICIA: Uh-oh!

466
00:32:15.556 --> 00:32:19.139
Brandy! Shit.

467
00:32:21.317 --> 00:32:23.236
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

468
00:32:23.237 --> 00:32:28.291
Mr. McBroom. Ma'am.
Where the fuck's Brandy at?

469
00:32:36.611 --> 00:32:42.660
- You ever hear of a rolling brown-out?
- No. Let's try it.

470
00:32:44.867 --> 00:32:48.963
Wait, brown? No, no, nothing brown!
Nothing brown! Nothing brown!

471
00:32:48.964 --> 00:32:51.522
What're you gonna do? Hit a girl?

472
00:32:51.523 --> 00:32:55.586
No, but I'm gonna
pummel his ass real good.

473
00:32:55.587 --> 00:32:58.535
There you go. There you go.

474
00:32:59.012 --> 00:33:02.506
Brandy! Come on, baby!
Open the God damn door!

475
00:33:08.258 --> 00:33:12.225
All right, this is not what it looks like.
It was a project for school.

476
00:33:12.226 --> 00:33:13.408
Purple Soda!

477
00:33:22.178 --> 00:33:24.003
Wiener!

478
00:33:26.978 --> 00:33:28.671
Ow!

479
00:33:38.688 --> 00:33:40.798
There you are.

480
00:33:42.274 --> 00:33:45.767
Come on, come on.
I do not want to die naked.

481
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.970
Fuck you! Motherfucking son of a bitch!

482
00:34:02.912 --> 00:34:07.039
Get on your feet, you motherfucking pussy!

483
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.725
Hey, hold on!

484
00:34:11.647 --> 00:34:12.894
Come on, man, she's not worth it.

485
00:34:12.895 --> 00:34:15.549
She's just gonna shit all over you.
Trust me.

486
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:18.596
Eat bat, dickhead!

487
00:34:19.454 --> 00:34:21.245
Holy shit!

488
00:34:22.848 --> 00:34:24.031
Ian just killed that guy.

489
00:34:24.032 --> 00:34:26.142
Sir? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

490
00:34:26.143 --> 00:34:29.405
Look, I have my insurance card.
I'm sorry. We're from out of town.

491
00:34:29.406 --> 00:34:32.828
I couldn't see you through the corn.
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:36.189 --> 00:34:38.396
IAN: Where the hell's the road?
FELICIA: It feels like left.

493
00:34:38.397 --> 00:34:39.580
IAN: I told you we didn't have time for this,

494
00:34:39.581 --> 00:34:41.819
- but all you care about is your stupid dick.
- Ian.

495
00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.519
And you leave us out there
with her mom's weird soda.

496
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.853
- Ian.
- And her dad's balls in plain view...

497
00:34:45.854 --> 00:34:47.039
Ian, Ian, whip a shitty!

498
00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.092
RICK: Motherfucker!

499
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.851
Holy fucking shit! That's how you do that!

500
00:35:01.852 --> 00:35:05.756
Oh, my God, Ian, amazing driving.
Lance, you suck!

501
00:35:05.757 --> 00:35:08.028
FELICIA: Where the hell are we?
IAN: Where are the Google maps?

502
00:35:08.029 --> 00:35:11.035
- They're in my pants.
- Which are?

503
00:35:11.036 --> 00:35:13.438
In the trailer.

504
00:35:14.363 --> 00:35:17.114
Mmm-hmm. Great.

505
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:21.885
Shit. I got gum in my bush.

506
00:35:24.892 --> 00:35:27.227
Hey, pick this guy up. Maybe he can
show us back to the highway.

507
00:35:27.228 --> 00:35:29.817
- Ian, do not pick up a hitchhiker.
- Don't worry, I won't.

508
00:35:32.218 --> 00:35:34.621
No, no, no.

509
00:35:35.162 --> 00:35:37.665
Oh, my God.

510
00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:43.385
Hey! Thanks for the lift, man.
I've been out there for hours.

511
00:35:43.386 --> 00:35:45.080
Not one car. Can you believe it?

512
00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:47.674
- Listen, sir, we didn't...
- You're good people.

513
00:35:47.675 --> 00:35:51.321
- Guy, you're not wearing any pants.
- Yeah, I know.

514
00:35:51.322 --> 00:35:53.311
Right on.

515
00:35:59.609 --> 00:36:04.313
I got nothing. There's no bars.
You know, it probably just needs water.

516
00:36:04.314 --> 00:36:05.942
Got any in the trunk?

517
00:36:05.943 --> 00:36:08.504
Hey, sweetheart, men are talking.
We got this one.

518
00:36:08.505 --> 00:36:11.450
Yeah, thanks,
but this happened to my brother's car once

519
00:36:11.451 --> 00:36:14.327
- and you just piss in the radiator.
- Really?

520
00:36:14.328 --> 00:36:16.534
FELICIA: Yeah.

521
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:19.095
Oh, God! Damn it!

522
00:36:20.376 --> 00:36:22.327
- Are you okay?
- Fuck. Yeah.

523
00:36:22.328 --> 00:36:24.632
LANCE: That's a lesson learned.

524
00:36:26.487 --> 00:36:28.344
You can watch,
if you're into that kind of thing.

525
00:36:28.345 --> 00:36:31.703
Oh, wow, thanks, but I think we've all seen
your dick enough for one day.

526
00:36:31.704 --> 00:36:36.406
- IAN: Do you hear that? There's a ringing.
- Your loss. It's like razor blades.

527
00:36:36.407 --> 00:36:41.077
IAN: What? There's ants down here. FYI.

528
00:36:41.078 --> 00:36:46.329
All right, you're up. Grip it and rip it.

529
00:36:46.357 --> 00:36:49.878
Okay. Go away.

530
00:36:49.879 --> 00:36:54.551
Dude, seriously? Still?
I thought you got over this shit.

531
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:57.435
You're a grown man.

532
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:07.252
Flowing river, gentle stream.
Flowing river, gentle stream.

533
00:37:07.253 --> 00:37:10.677
- Yo, stage fright, how're we doing?
- Damn it, Lance, just give me a minute.

534
00:37:12.885 --> 00:37:17.716
Excuse me.
We kind of need you to pee in the radiator.

535
00:37:17.717 --> 00:37:21.396
- Why?
- We just do.

536
00:37:23.124 --> 00:37:26.673
Our new friend's got nothing left
in the tank.

537
00:37:30.293 --> 00:37:31.475
What?

538
00:37:36.916 --> 00:37:39.482
You kids need some help?

539
00:37:45.395 --> 00:37:47.056
Hi.

540
00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:53.554
Are you okay?

541
00:37:53.555 --> 00:37:56.978
Oh, yeah, I'm great.
I just beaved a family of four.

542
00:37:58.037 --> 00:37:59.827
Try it.

543
00:38:04.082 --> 00:38:05.265
All set?

544
00:38:05.266 --> 00:38:08.662
Look, I'm sorry, sir,
but we can't give you a ride.

545
00:38:10.001 --> 00:38:12.082
I'm gonna say this once.

546
00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:16.433
You unlock this fucking car,
or God is my witness,

547
00:38:16.434 --> 00:38:18.576
I'll stake you all to the ground,

548
00:38:18.577 --> 00:38:22.388
cut you open and let the dogs get at you.

549
00:38:23.154 --> 00:38:24.782
Oh, yeah?

550
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.585
Bye-bye.

551
00:38:39.536 --> 00:38:43.477
- Here's that pee you ordered.
- Roll them up.

552
00:38:44.016 --> 00:38:47.854
- There you go, Tex.
- FELICIA: You're soaked with pee.

553
00:38:47.855 --> 00:38:49.422
Quick car wash?

554
00:38:49.423 --> 00:38:51.821
- God!
- FELICIA: Gross.

555
00:38:51.822 --> 00:38:55.951
It smells like Halloween. Fuck.

556
00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.382
IAN: How can nobody go down a road
for an hour and a half?

557
00:38:58.383 --> 00:39:00.206
Why did they even make this stupid road?

558
00:39:00.207 --> 00:39:02.221
FELICIA: It's so hot out here.

559
00:39:02.222 --> 00:39:04.397
Ow!

560
00:39:06.766 --> 00:39:11.373
Oh, my God, your head.
Wait... Does it hurt? Let me see.

561
00:39:11.374 --> 00:39:14.028
Yes. It hurts.

562
00:39:15.535 --> 00:39:19.510
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

563
00:39:22.254 --> 00:39:23.882
IAN: Wow.

564
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.443
That is so beautiful.

565
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:47.468
Need some help?

566
00:39:48.781 --> 00:39:53.675
- Yeah, but no offense...
- Oh, right, 'cause I'm Amish,

567
00:39:53.676 --> 00:39:56.812
so I wouldn't know anything
about your '69 GTO Judge.

568
00:39:56.813 --> 00:40:00.491
455 Big Block, Ram Air. 4-11 posi,
something like that.

569
00:40:00.492 --> 00:40:03.467
Weird, that thing must have fallen
straight from space.

570
00:40:03.468 --> 00:40:06.732
Well, good luck with the future ride,
spaceman.

571
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:11.114
Hey, dude, wait up. Hold on.

572
00:40:11.115 --> 00:40:12.265
IAN: Wow!

573
00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:13.321
FELICIA: Okay.

574
00:40:13.322 --> 00:40:17.610
What are you doing? Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Leesh, that's a bad idea.

575
00:40:17.611 --> 00:40:18.794
- What?
- Come on.

576
00:40:18.795 --> 00:40:21.324
You don't know how far we have to walk.
Those are your only pair of shoes.

577
00:40:21.325 --> 00:40:24.585
You know what? You're probably right.
God, you're so sensible.

578
00:40:24.586 --> 00:40:27.209
But maybe I should? Or maybe I shouldn't?

579
00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.134
I should.

580
00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.552
I can't believe you just did that.

581
00:40:32.553 --> 00:40:35.721
- All right. Now you.
- No way. Forget it.

582
00:40:35.722 --> 00:40:38.218
Dude, you never do anything crazy. Ever.

583
00:40:38.219 --> 00:40:41.290
Hey! I'm driving halfway across the country
to go to...

584
00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:44.776
To visit your grandma? Whoa!

585
00:40:44.777 --> 00:40:47.816
So he met this chick on the Internet,
which is sketchy.

586
00:40:47.817 --> 00:40:49.640
The Internet?

587
00:40:49.641 --> 00:40:53.831
Yeah, it's like a series of computers
that are connected through...

588
00:40:53.832 --> 00:40:55.788
Computers?

589
00:40:57.192 --> 00:41:00.456
A computer's like a big calculator,
you know, with a screen.

590
00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:02.696
I'm just busting your balls, man.
I know what the Internet is.

591
00:41:05.448 --> 00:41:07.495
- Okay.
- You ever heard of Rumspringa?

592
00:41:07.496 --> 00:41:09.832
Yeah, that ska band from Delaware.

593
00:41:09.833 --> 00:41:13.959
No, it means "run wild. " It's an Amish
tradition where when we turn 16,

594
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.454
we can go live like you heathens
for a while.

595
00:41:16.455 --> 00:41:21.479
You go nuts, party for months or years
till your folks start hassling you,

596
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.911
and then it's back to the Stone Age.

597
00:41:23.912 --> 00:41:25.862
But if you're on Rumspringa,
what's with the buggy?

598
00:41:25.863 --> 00:41:28.647
Oh, no, I'm not. Not anymore.

599
00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:31.429
I probably shouldn't even be
talking to you, but...

600
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.149
I'm a little bit of an Amish floutlaw.

601
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.572
- Sometimes I just miss the world.
- What do you miss the most?

602
00:41:37.573 --> 00:41:40.548
You know, I miss sarcasm.
It's mostly lost on my people.

603
00:41:40.549 --> 00:41:41.606
Oh.

604
00:41:41.607 --> 00:41:48.199
And gambling. Went to Vegas once.
And butt fucking.

605
00:41:48.774 --> 00:41:52.805
- Got a lot of nice memories there.
- I hear that.

606
00:41:52.806 --> 00:41:54.500
IAN: You know, when you cut your foot on
a piece of glass,

607
00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:56.900
- don't think I'm gonna carry you.
- You know what? I will be fine. Okay?

608
00:41:56.901 --> 00:42:01.670
- I was born barefoot.
- Hey! Wait!

609
00:42:01.671 --> 00:42:05.284
Hey! Stop!

610
00:42:08.165 --> 00:42:10.754
Have a nice walk, shit-birds.

611
00:42:12.996 --> 00:42:15.235
BOTH: Oh!

612
00:42:17.859 --> 00:42:20.450
Hey, Ian, Felicia, this is my boy, Ezekiel.

613
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:22.758
What up, English?

614
00:42:30.659 --> 00:42:32.738
There's no service out here.

615
00:42:32.739 --> 00:42:35.715
- I can't even tell her I'll be late.
- Good. That's perfect. Keep her waiting.

616
00:42:35.716 --> 00:42:36.802
You don't want to come off as desperate.

617
00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:40.770
I'm driving nine hours.
How am I not coming off desperate?

618
00:42:40.771 --> 00:42:45.282
- We had shit to do.
- Uh-oh! See that creamy stuff?

619
00:42:45.283 --> 00:42:48.003
You blew your head gasket.
That's not good.

620
00:42:48.004 --> 00:42:50.498
- Shit.
- Don't cry. We can fix it.

621
00:42:50.499 --> 00:42:52.609
- Really?
- Yeah, really. We're good at it.

622
00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:54.145
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I didn't mean to undersell it,

623
00:42:54.146 --> 00:42:55.297
but it's an impressive thing.

624
00:42:55.298 --> 00:42:57.121
- Yeah. We'll fix it.
- Wow, that'd be cool.

625
00:42:57.122 --> 00:43:01.248
Yeah, would be cool, wouldn't it?
I might be the coolest guy you ever met.

626
00:43:01.249 --> 00:43:03.105
- Wow.
- Wow.

627
00:43:03.393 --> 00:43:04.993
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

628
00:43:04.994 --> 00:43:07.553
That's what you say
when people do nice things for you.

629
00:43:07.554 --> 00:43:09.600
You know, there's a pretty big shindig
shaping up next door

630
00:43:09.601 --> 00:43:12.576
if you guys want to hang there
while we work on it.

631
00:43:12.577 --> 00:43:15.646
Take it easy while we do all this for you.

632
00:43:17.825 --> 00:43:21.852
- Does he have an attitude?
- No, he's fucking with you.

633
00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:23.644
Okay.

634
00:43:24.448 --> 00:43:28.192
Just relax, man.
I got a good feeling about this, you know.

635
00:43:28.193 --> 00:43:29.632
You're gonna party with the Amish.

636
00:43:29.633 --> 00:43:33.247
Yeah, I'm sure it's gonna be
one kick-ass quilting bee.

637
00:43:35.424 --> 00:43:36.926
What's up, man?

638
00:43:36.927 --> 00:43:41.917
- Hey.
- No f-ing way!

639
00:43:44.383 --> 00:43:48.380
<i>When I'm home alone
I just can't stop myself</i>

640
00:43:49.151 --> 00:43:52.318
- This is insane!
- I know.

641
00:43:53.983 --> 00:44:00.509
<i>Signing off, " I'm all right in bed,
but I'm better with a pen"...</i>

642
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:05.978
<i>I'm all right in bed,
but I'm better with a pen...</i>

643
00:44:06.013 --> 00:44:11.421
<i>I'm all right in bed,
but I'm better with a pen...</i>

644
00:44:11.422 --> 00:44:17.316
<i>The kid was all right,
but it went to his head...</i>

645
00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:29.468
<i>Thank you, guys, very, very, very much.
You guys fucking rule, man.</i>

646
00:44:44.571 --> 00:44:48.442
Dude. Don't even bother.
Your game is not gonna work on that girl.

647
00:44:48.443 --> 00:44:53.085
What do you know about girls?
I've never even seen you with a girl.

648
00:44:53.116 --> 00:44:55.934
I'm gonna go check on the car.

649
00:45:00.986 --> 00:45:03.257
Yeah, fuck it. Let's dance.

650
00:45:03.258 --> 00:45:08.192
- Bite me. I'm not your consolation prize.
- Come on. Don't be hating.

651
00:45:11.995 --> 00:45:14.104
Fine.

652
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.696
EZEKIEL: I've never shot a flaming
arrow that far, but I was game to try.

653
00:45:28.697 --> 00:45:30.072
And the thing is,
the second you let it release...

654
00:45:30.073 --> 00:45:35.609
Whoa! Hey, what is this?
Why are the seats out?

655
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:37.913
Ian, do you know anything
about fixing these old Pontiacs?

656
00:45:37.914 --> 00:45:41.911
I don't care, okay?
Ezekiel, take all the pieces and just

657
00:45:41.912 --> 00:45:44.919
- put them back in there. I don't want...
- Ian, you've gotta calm down.

658
00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.263
Do you know any breathing exercises?

659
00:45:46.264 --> 00:45:48.407
Because you are right on the verge
of a freak-out.

660
00:45:48.408 --> 00:45:53.079
You don't know my brother, okay? He's
gonna fuck my ass with a roll of quarters.

661
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.631
What? He's gonna what? With what?

662
00:45:56.632 --> 00:46:01.270
Oh, yeah! He's gonna go get off work early,
and he's gonna walk into the bank,

663
00:46:01.271 --> 00:46:03.415
stand in line, change a 10,

664
00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:07.772
find my ass and just fuck it
with a roll of fucking quarters.

665
00:46:45.206 --> 00:46:49.428
Check it out. It's totally working.

666
00:46:49.429 --> 00:46:51.635
You're the best wing-man ever.

667
00:46:51.636 --> 00:46:54.739
She's in, she's in. Watch this.

668
00:47:03.797 --> 00:47:07.825
GIRL: Rumspringa! Whoo!

669
00:47:08.723 --> 00:47:11.858
- I took a wicked digger.
- Yes, you did.

670
00:47:12.115 --> 00:47:15.123
- First day of Rumspringa?
- Rumspringa!

671
00:47:17.748 --> 00:47:19.314
- Uh-oh!
- Oh!

672
00:47:21.843 --> 00:47:23.569
Hey.

673
00:47:25.011 --> 00:47:30.450
- All right. Okay. You good? All right.
- Aw! You guys are so nice.

674
00:47:30.451 --> 00:47:32.434
Don't let her step in it.

675
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.611
What? What's wrong with you?

676
00:47:38.612 --> 00:47:42.578
- Yeah, what's your problem, bitch?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

677
00:47:42.579 --> 00:47:45.553
Nothing. She's fine. God, lay off.

678
00:47:45.554 --> 00:47:46.993
- It's Lance, right?
- No.

679
00:47:46.994 --> 00:47:49.328
I'll bet he's in there with that Amish girl
and you're out here.

680
00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:50.385
Wrong.

681
00:47:50.386 --> 00:47:53.200
Come on, Leesh, just drop
the hard-ass thing for two minutes.

682
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:57.362
You know. It's okay. You're into Lance.

683
00:47:59.089 --> 00:48:02.997
- God, I'm such an idiot.
- Look, there's something about Lance.

684
00:48:03.409 --> 00:48:08.148
Everybody likes Lance. I like Lance.

685
00:48:09.137 --> 00:48:12.015
Just promise me
you won't ever be like Lance.

686
00:48:13.584 --> 00:48:18.704
What is wrong with us?
Let's go have some fun. Come on.

687
00:48:18.705 --> 00:48:21.136
- No. No.
- No?

688
00:48:21.137 --> 00:48:25.935
Come on, we're young, and we're Amish,
and it's Rumspringa.

689
00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:27.343
DRUNK AMISH GIRL: Rumspringa!

690
00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:56.912
Ian, you little cock-sucker!

691
00:49:15.276 --> 00:49:16.363
Ah!

692
00:49:16.364 --> 00:49:18.987
Leesh, you're so stubborn.
Look at your feet.

693
00:49:18.988 --> 00:49:21.873
They are fine. All right?

694
00:49:22.637 --> 00:49:25.488
Hey. What's the plan?

695
00:49:26.092 --> 00:49:29.553
I might as well find a phone and call Rex

696
00:49:29.612 --> 00:49:33.707
- so he can get on with killing me.
- What about visiting your grandma?

697
00:49:33.708 --> 00:49:37.098
Yeah, dude. You been putting off
visiting your grandma for too long.

698
00:49:37.099 --> 00:49:40.298
- It's about time you visited Grandma.
- Yeah.

699
00:49:40.299 --> 00:49:45.387
Lance, you know,
I really do want to visit my grandma, but...

700
00:49:45.388 --> 00:49:50.410
Dude, I really can't stress enough how
much you're gonna enjoy visiting Grandma.

701
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:53.994
You know, I visit my grandma sometimes
two or three times a week,

702
00:49:53.995 --> 00:49:57.129
and it is always a pleasure.
She's just a delight.

703
00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:58.185
What am I supposed to do?

704
00:49:58.186 --> 00:50:00.456
Our transportation is all over the floor
of that barn.

705
00:50:00.457 --> 00:50:02.415
Hey, Mary!

706
00:50:04.011 --> 00:50:05.639
Hi.

707
00:50:08.586 --> 00:50:12.201
Wow, you look beautiful.

708
00:50:12.202 --> 00:50:13.449
Oh, please.

709
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:18.536
I mean, seriously, you wearing that,
churning some butter. Sexy.

710
00:50:18.537 --> 00:50:21.224
So I had the best time with you last night.

711
00:50:21.225 --> 00:50:22.663
Yeah, me, too.

712
00:50:22.664 --> 00:50:26.095
So you got my number.
You're gonna call me, right?

713
00:50:26.538 --> 00:50:27.753
No.

714
00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:32.107
"No. " You're funny.

715
00:50:32.137 --> 00:50:38.282
I mean, Lance, I really like you,
but Rumspringa's over for me.

716
00:50:38.408 --> 00:50:40.201
- So...
- Rumspringa!

717
00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.429
Sorry.

718
00:51:12.615 --> 00:51:13.830
You fixed it?

719
00:51:13.831 --> 00:51:17.253
Yeah, we hit a few snags,
but she's banging like a champ now.

720
00:51:17.254 --> 00:51:20.068
Man, I don't even...
I don't even know what to say here.

721
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:22.436
You know, I don't really have much...

722
00:51:22.437 --> 00:51:24.228
Oh, no, we're good. We're good.

723
00:51:24.229 --> 00:51:27.812
I mean, the opportunity to help a neighbor,
that's a gift.

724
00:51:28.134 --> 00:51:31.332
Man, you're too... Here, thanks.
Thank you so much.

725
00:51:31.333 --> 00:51:32.996
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, it's really cool.

726
00:51:32.997 --> 00:51:34.948
It is. You know, I mean,

727
00:51:34.949 --> 00:51:38.212
if you felt the need to reciprocate
in some way,

728
00:51:38.213 --> 00:51:40.580
I mean, there's a lot of chores
that need to be done around here.

729
00:51:40.581 --> 00:51:44.579
Yeah, no, the only thing about that is
we're kind of behind schedule right now.

730
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.597
Yeah, but, I mean,
we could totally come back.

731
00:51:46.598 --> 00:51:48.868
- We could hit you on our way back through.
- Okay.

732
00:51:48.869 --> 00:51:51.460
Yeah, you should.
You should really get on the road.

733
00:51:51.461 --> 00:51:56.163
I mean, you got a smooth-running
vehicle now, you know, 'cause we fixed it.

734
00:51:56.164 --> 00:52:01.480
- Yeah. No, but it's... So we're good?
- We're good. Yeah, technically.

735
00:52:01.571 --> 00:52:02.914
We'll come back. I promise.

736
00:52:02.915 --> 00:52:06.145
- I'm looking forward to that.
- Hey, no, seriously, we will.

737
00:52:06.146 --> 00:52:08.547
Okay. We'll all hold our breath
till you get back.

738
00:52:08.548 --> 00:52:12.194
On three, guys. Three, two...

739
00:52:20.803 --> 00:52:24.481
My stomach's killing me.
Tell me if you see a rest stop.

740
00:52:42.881 --> 00:52:45.824
Fuck. I know you didn't take my car, Ian.

741
00:52:45.825 --> 00:52:47.842
'Cause you're a big, giant pussy.
That's right.

742
00:52:47.843 --> 00:52:50.399
That's why. It's here, isn't it?

743
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.360
Want some of this?

744
00:53:12.417 --> 00:53:13.472
Shit!

745
00:53:13.473 --> 00:53:17.055
Hey, Knievel, what say you get
your bike out of the fricking road?

746
00:53:17.056 --> 00:53:21.051
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

747
00:53:34.367 --> 00:53:36.769
<i>All ocupado, eh, sport?</i>

748
00:53:41.663 --> 00:53:43.390
Gents.

749
00:53:43.391 --> 00:53:48.096
Well, looks like we're up.
Go on, get in there.

750
00:53:55.902 --> 00:53:57.469
Oh!

751
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:59.905
Am I getting a signal?

752
00:54:00.733 --> 00:54:04.511
Tasty, I got sidetracked last night.

753
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:08.442
I had to party with some new homies.

754
00:54:10.396 --> 00:54:15.102
Tonight, 8:00 p. m. at Big Boy.

755
00:54:16.061 --> 00:54:18.431
I'm worth the wait.

756
00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:24.088
Yes!

757
00:54:31.195 --> 00:54:35.738
No! Oh, God! No, thank you! No, thank you!

758
00:54:38.332 --> 00:54:42.393
Little buddy? Hello? Hello.

759
00:54:44.378 --> 00:54:47.962
- LANCE: Was that you screaming in there?
- I don't want to talk about it. Ever.

760
00:54:47.963 --> 00:54:51.544
- Where's Felicia?
- She went to get corn dogs.

761
00:55:15.033 --> 00:55:17.497
Can you believe
the girls around here, man?

762
00:55:17.498 --> 00:55:22.006
But, man, where am I ever gonna find
another girl as cool as Mary?

763
00:55:24.217 --> 00:55:26.238
You like it?

764
00:55:30.232 --> 00:55:33.245
- What about Felicia?
- What about her?

765
00:55:35.895 --> 00:55:39.544
- She's into you.
- Yeah, no shit. Get in line.

766
00:55:39.545 --> 00:55:42.230
What is that?
She's not good enough for you?

767
00:55:42.231 --> 00:55:44.150
Felicia's awesome,

768
00:55:44.151 --> 00:55:47.831
but the obvious statement to make here
is that you like her.

769
00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:52.342
- What? No, I...
- You're shocked. You can't believe it.

770
00:55:52.343 --> 00:55:56.629
- This bombshell. Come on.
- You know, she's not into me anyways.

771
00:55:56.630 --> 00:56:01.205
Yeah, I know. But it doesn't matter.
I still... I could never do that to you.

772
00:56:01.847 --> 00:56:05.590
Okay, but you do know
that she's not into you, right?

773
00:56:05.591 --> 00:56:09.941
- Yeah. Well, maybe you don't know.
- No. No, no, I'm gonna stop you.

774
00:56:09.942 --> 00:56:14.324
There's no maybe. Okay?
And I'm saying this as your best friend,

775
00:56:14.325 --> 00:56:19.765
but never. Never fucking ever. You know?

776
00:56:19.766 --> 00:56:21.045
Because you guys are friends.

777
00:56:21.046 --> 00:56:25.303
You know what every girl
I've ever banged had in common?

778
00:56:25.717 --> 00:56:28.732
I wasn't friends with any of them.

779
00:56:30.101 --> 00:56:33.492
And they all had gorgeous teeth.
I'm into that.

780
00:56:33.493 --> 00:56:36.883
Real simple.
Climb the rope, hit the bell, win a prize.

781
00:56:36.884 --> 00:56:40.373
Hey, there, Bilbo Baggins,
there's no height requirement.

782
00:56:40.374 --> 00:56:42.964
Why don't you step up
and win your girlfriend a prize?

783
00:56:42.965 --> 00:56:46.259
Uh... We're not... She's not my girlfriend.

784
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:49.907
- What about your other girlfriend there?
- Nice.

785
00:57:06.163 --> 00:57:07.954
All right, come on, Ian. You can do it.

786
00:57:07.955 --> 00:57:11.186
Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there! Go, go, go!

787
00:57:11.187 --> 00:57:13.590
<i>AUTOMATED MALE VOICE:
Winner! Winner! Winner!</i>

788
00:57:14.227 --> 00:57:16.593
- That was awesome.
- How the hell did you do that?

789
00:57:16.594 --> 00:57:18.769
We had one of these at Cub Scout camp.
I kind of mastered it.

790
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:21.393
Yeah, you think you're hot shit?

791
00:57:22.675 --> 00:57:26.168
- Lolly?
- Thank you.

792
00:57:29.074 --> 00:57:31.412
Hey, hey, hey, ass.

793
00:57:34.129 --> 00:57:36.111
Hey. What's your secret?

794
00:57:36.112 --> 00:57:38.895
You just...
If you keep your shoulders down...

795
00:57:38.896 --> 00:57:41.841
- No coaching.
- What?

796
00:57:41.842 --> 00:57:44.272
No coaching there, Lombardi.
Read the sign.

797
00:57:44.273 --> 00:57:46.862
No coaching.

798
00:57:48.912 --> 00:57:50.927
Cheese and rice!

799
00:57:50.928 --> 00:57:52.623
Oh.

800
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:57.072
- Thanks. I'm Sandy.
- I'm Ian.

801
00:57:57.073 --> 00:57:58.962
- Hi.
- Hey.

802
00:58:02.095 --> 00:58:06.191
- Consolation prize?
- Wow! Thank you so much.

803
00:58:06.192 --> 00:58:08.847
You know, my dance team's performing
over at the tent in a couple of minutes.

804
00:58:08.848 --> 00:58:10.223
You guys should come watch.

805
00:58:10.224 --> 00:58:13.006
- Actually, we were just about to go.
- That sounds super fun. He'll be there.

806
00:58:13.007 --> 00:58:15.279
Great. See you.

807
00:58:15.791 --> 00:58:17.696
Dude, that girl reeks of sex.

808
00:58:19.534 --> 00:58:23.183
<i>Everybody's talking all this stuff about me</i>

809
00:58:23.184 --> 00:58:27.341
<i>Why don't they just let me live?</i>

810
00:58:27.342 --> 00:58:28.878
<i>I don't need permission</i>

811
00:58:28.879 --> 00:58:30.766
- Do we really have time for...
- Hey, hey.

812
00:58:30.767 --> 00:58:32.429
You have to stop doing that to him.

813
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:34.350
- Doing what?
- Twat blocking.

814
00:58:34.351 --> 00:58:38.063
I'm not twat... Doing that.

815
00:58:45.902 --> 00:58:50.705
<i>Yeah! Let's give it up for the AX Dancers!</i>

816
00:58:51.085 --> 00:58:54.961
<i>Come on, girls,
let's help me get some fellas up in here.</i>

817
00:58:56.077 --> 00:58:57.355
- Ian.
- Oh, no. Please.

818
00:58:57.356 --> 00:58:59.403
Get up there. Come on.

819
00:58:59.404 --> 00:59:01.294
SANDY: Come on!

820
00:59:01.452 --> 00:59:03.403
<i>KAT: In the back! In the back!</i>

821
00:59:03.404 --> 00:59:06.092
<i>Yeah!</i>

822
00:59:08.557 --> 00:59:13.992
<i>Come on, two more, two more! Yeah!</i>

823
00:59:16.332 --> 00:59:17.931
Dude, turn around.

824
00:59:25.804 --> 00:59:31.665
<i>Look at this fine crop
of handsome fellas I got here.</i>

825
00:59:32.619 --> 00:59:35.274
<i>But before we get down to business,</i>

826
00:59:35.275 --> 00:59:36.809
<i>there's a young woman here</i>

827
00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:39.753
<i>who would like to share her story
with these young men.</i>

828
00:59:39.754 --> 00:59:44.262
<i>- Kristy, you ready, baby?
- Okay.</i>

829
00:59:46.313 --> 00:59:50.473
<i>So, last year I was at a dance
with my boyfriend.</i>

830
00:59:50.474 --> 00:59:53.128
<i>He wanted to go to his car.</i>

831
00:59:53.129 --> 00:59:54.856
<i>So I did.</i>

832
00:59:54.857 --> 01:00:00.807
<i>So we were both naked in the back seat
and we started having oral...</i>

833
01:00:13.769 --> 01:00:16.041
<i>MAN IMITATING SOUL SINGER: Yeah!</i>

834
01:00:17.353 --> 01:00:19.625
<i>Daddy likes that!</i>

835
01:00:21.671 --> 01:00:23.111
Excuse me!

836
01:00:23.112 --> 01:00:28.942
<i>Excuse me!
Is this tragic story turning you on?</i>

837
01:00:37.799 --> 01:00:43.494
<i>This courageous young lady pours
her heart out and this is getting you hot?</i>

838
01:00:43.495 --> 01:00:46.245
<i>It's time for you to pledge. Right now!</i>

839
01:00:46.246 --> 01:00:49.677
<i>Boy, you need this more than anybody.</i>

840
01:00:50.312 --> 01:00:53.064
Hey, keep a wrinkle in it, captain.

841
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:58.246
I can't believe you took
a fucking abstinence pledge with a hard-on.

842
01:00:58.247 --> 01:00:59.333
It's classic.

843
01:00:59.334 --> 01:01:02.500
Look, I didn't even know what she was
talking about. That doesn't count! Okay?

844
01:01:02.501 --> 01:01:04.357
- Ian! Hey!
- It gets better.

845
01:01:04.358 --> 01:01:06.660
I am so proud of you!

846
01:01:06.661 --> 01:01:08.259
Get away from me. Is that what you do?

847
01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.525
You go out and you lure little dorks like me
into your little no-having-sex club?

848
01:01:11.526 --> 01:01:13.508
Ian, it's not like that at all.

849
01:01:13.509 --> 01:01:16.741
Just go away. Now.

850
01:01:19.749 --> 01:01:22.628
- I would've blown you, you know.
- Really?

851
01:01:22.629 --> 01:01:23.748
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

852
01:01:23.749 --> 01:01:27.363
You can keep your stupid
flipping lollipop, anyway!

853
01:01:29.316 --> 01:01:31.556
- You are dead, psycho-virgin!
- No, no!

854
01:01:31.557 --> 01:01:34.091
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

855
01:01:36.356 --> 01:01:40.810
Hey, are you sure you want to get
dental work done in Floater, Kentucky?

856
01:01:41.668 --> 01:01:44.002
Dr. Teddescoe will be with you present-like.

857
01:01:44.003 --> 01:01:45.506
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

858
01:01:57.859 --> 01:02:01.090
Fine, okay, you were right.
My feet are killing me,

859
01:02:01.091 --> 01:02:03.906
and I never should've tossed my shoes.

860
01:02:03.907 --> 01:02:08.360
No, come on.
I love that your shoes are in that tree.

861
01:02:10.274 --> 01:02:13.770
I do. That's premium Felicia.

862
01:02:16.578 --> 01:02:18.206
Oh.

863
01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:22.465
- So what'd you do to her?
- Hmm?

864
01:02:22.466 --> 01:02:23.937
Smack her around a little bit?

865
01:02:23.938 --> 01:02:25.824
She gets out of line, you pop her one?

866
01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:29.407
- No. No, sir, I...
- I got you. I'm just teasing you, man.

867
01:02:29.408 --> 01:02:31.614
We have fun.

868
01:02:31.872 --> 01:02:35.106
- He didn't, though, did he?
- Hmm? Mmm-mmm.

869
01:02:35.394 --> 01:02:37.411
Be back in a couple minutes.
I'm gonna wait for that to numb up.

870
01:02:37.412 --> 01:02:38.656
Mmm-hmm.

871
01:02:38.657 --> 01:02:41.278
Hands to yourself, O.J.

872
01:02:42.529 --> 01:02:47.103
Ian, you know the other night
at Lance's party?

873
01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:52.637
- Was I there?
- No, come on.

874
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.909
Here.

875
01:02:58.528 --> 01:03:04.924
I mean, you know the only reason is
because I don't want to ruin our friendship.

876
01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:10.145
Totally, I mean friendship is awesome.
Good call.

877
01:03:10.719 --> 01:03:15.326
I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you.

878
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:27.037
- You won't.
- What are you thinking about?

879
01:03:28.702 --> 01:03:32.316
- What are you thinking about?
- I asked you first.

880
01:03:35.677 --> 01:03:36.957
You got a little loogie.

881
01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:41.917
I'm gonna go see if Lance...

882
01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:42.972
Mmm-hmm.

883
01:03:42.973 --> 01:03:45.147
Go. Go.

884
01:03:56.188 --> 01:04:00.251
Um, I'll take these as well.

885
01:04:03.644 --> 01:04:08.699
They're not for me. They're not.

886
01:04:16.347 --> 01:04:19.679
- Heads up.
- What's with you?

887
01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:23.003
I'm thinking maybe we head back home.

888
01:04:23.004 --> 01:04:24.762
What? Why?

889
01:04:24.763 --> 01:04:28.281
Well, Felicia and I were talking in there,

890
01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:31.929
- and we kind of had a moment.
- Oh! Oh, did you guys have a little moment?

891
01:04:31.930 --> 01:04:34.073
- Yeah.
- You're a moron.

892
01:04:34.074 --> 01:04:36.792
Fuck you. We've talked about this.

893
01:04:36.793 --> 01:04:39.930
Look, we're almost there,
and I'm not letting her do this.

894
01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:43.512
We're going to Knoxville,
and you're getting your nut.

895
01:04:43.514 --> 01:04:45.593
No, I'm not. I'm not.

896
01:04:45.594 --> 01:04:48.344
No, I'm gonna text Tasty,
and I'm gonna tell her I'm not coming.

897
01:04:48.345 --> 01:04:51.928
- Ian, get in this car.
- I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

898
01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:56.344
Shit, where's my phone?
Hey, you got a new smile.

899
01:04:56.345 --> 01:04:59.897
You have my phone. I didn't know...
This is for you.

900
01:04:59.898 --> 01:05:02.521
Mmm! A message came in.

901
01:05:02.522 --> 01:05:05.432
Your grandma says she's really excited
to see you.

902
01:05:05.433 --> 01:05:07.672
And something about her hot,
shaved pussy.

903
01:05:07.673 --> 01:05:09.015
Must be the cancer talking.

904
01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.991
All right. Good deal.
We're going to Knoxville.

905
01:05:15.383 --> 01:05:18.877
<i>All I've got is frustration, frustration</i>

906
01:05:20.761 --> 01:05:23.607
<i>I hate this vacation</i>

907
01:05:23.608 --> 01:05:27.670
<i>So, give up, give up
Give up, give up</i>

908
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:31.255
<i>I've got to get away from here
It's killing me just thinking 'bout</i>

909
01:05:31.256 --> 01:05:36.341
<i>Frustration, frustration
I hate this vacation...</i>

910
01:05:36.342 --> 01:05:38.965
Ian, you're going the wrong way.

911
01:05:38.966 --> 01:05:41.397
- We're going home.
- What?

912
01:05:41.398 --> 01:05:44.342
Please, do not turn around
because of me. Okay.

913
01:05:44.343 --> 01:05:46.646
- Yeah, no shit.
- I'm dying to see Ms. Tasty.

914
01:05:46.647 --> 01:05:48.022
This is going to be hilarious.

915
01:05:48.023 --> 01:05:50.453
A hundred bucks says she has a wiener.

916
01:05:50.454 --> 01:05:53.301
Look, I said we're going home.
I don't want to talk about it.

917
01:05:53.302 --> 01:05:54.901
I knew you'd find some way
to fuck this up for him.

918
01:05:54.902 --> 01:05:58.228
Me? You two are fucking scheming
behind my back.

919
01:05:58.229 --> 01:06:00.564
- No, we're not.
- Okay. You stole Rex's car.

920
01:06:00.565 --> 01:06:02.259
You drove halfway across the country.

921
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.205
This must be what you want to do.
So do it, chicken shit!

922
01:06:05.206 --> 01:06:07.572
- Fucking A, chicken shit.
- Fine! You know what?

923
01:06:07.573 --> 01:06:10.516
I'll turn the car around, I'll flip a bitch,
and I'll go pork somebody. Right now.

924
01:06:10.517 --> 01:06:11.988
I'll be that guy. Is that what you want?

925
01:06:11.989 --> 01:06:13.780
- Be that guy! That guy rules.
- FELICIA: Sounds awesome.

926
01:06:13.781 --> 01:06:15.502
That would make me so happy.

927
01:06:15.503 --> 01:06:17.396
All right. All right.
Fantastic! I'm doing it.

928
01:06:17.397 --> 01:06:20.891
LANCE: Watch out, Ian! Fuck!
FELICIA: Watch it, Ian!

929
01:06:22.196 --> 01:06:23.380
Whoo!

930
01:06:24.533 --> 01:06:27.028
- IAN: You like that?
- Did your fucking balls just drop?

931
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:29.137
Holy shit, Ian.

932
01:06:29.365 --> 01:06:36.469
- Oh, man, it's this douche again.
- You want it? You got it.

933
01:06:36.819 --> 01:06:38.770
- Hold on to your pantyhose.
- Okay, we gotta work on your banter,

934
01:06:38.771 --> 01:06:40.977
but otherwise, this is awesome.

935
01:06:43.729 --> 01:06:47.094
- You're losing him.
- No, I got him. I got him.

936
01:06:48.723 --> 01:06:52.980
- Jesus, Ian! Not so close.
- God damn it!

937
01:06:56.691 --> 01:06:59.257
No way, man! You're dead.

938
01:07:00.498 --> 01:07:02.896
Sorry. He's all right.

939
01:07:02.897 --> 01:07:06.066
LANCE: This guy's fucking dangerous!

940
01:07:10.707 --> 01:07:12.433
Where is he? Talk to me, dudes.

941
01:07:12.434 --> 01:07:15.600
Right up our ass. He's in our ass.

942
01:07:19.408 --> 01:07:22.543
- LANCE: He's tagging out.
- Ah! Ladies!

943
01:07:22.544 --> 01:07:23.567
Ian, look out!

944
01:07:29.425 --> 01:07:30.831
Oh! Oh!

945
01:07:30.832 --> 01:07:32.624
God damn it.

946
01:07:33.648 --> 01:07:37.906
What were you doing, man? Shit.

947
01:07:38.704 --> 01:07:41.263
Dude, take it easy. This wasn't your fault.
He jumped right in front of you.

948
01:07:41.264 --> 01:07:44.399
Just shut up, Lance. Of course it's my fault.

949
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.905
Now, come on, man,
this possum's not gonna fuck you.

950
01:07:45.906 --> 01:07:47.440
We gotta go find Ms. Tasty.

951
01:07:47.441 --> 01:07:52.310
He's suffering, Lance. I'm not gonna
leave him here by himself. Okay?

952
01:07:52.847 --> 01:07:56.145
Okay. You're right.

953
01:07:57.519 --> 01:08:01.005
We gotta help him.
We gotta call a vet or something.

954
01:08:01.006 --> 01:08:06.541
Ian, look at him.
There's not a lot that we can do.

955
01:08:07.533 --> 01:08:09.966
You guys'll probably want to back up.
This'll probably stink like shit.

956
01:08:09.967 --> 01:08:13.198
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm gonna take him out of his misery.

957
01:08:13.199 --> 01:08:16.621
They don't make little wheelchairs for him.
He's done, man.

958
01:08:16.622 --> 01:08:20.433
IAN: Fuck you, Lance.
God, you don't even give a shit about him.

959
01:08:21.454 --> 01:08:23.442
I'll do it.

960
01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:33.522
I'm sorry.

01:08:46.411 --> 01:08:48.432
Shit.

01:08:54.636 --> 01:08:57.170
Oh, no.

Oh, God! Jesus fucking... God damn it!
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

- God! Fuck!

968
01:09:12.812 --> 01:09:17.067
You guys ever listen to Sonic Youth? I've
been on a big Sonic Youth phase lately.

969
01:09:18.123 --> 01:09:21.104
You know, their bass player's a woman.

970
01:09:31.786 --> 01:09:33.927
We are in jail.

971
01:09:42.185 --> 01:09:45.064
Okay, listen, you have got to be cool,
'cause if they see you shitting yourself

972
01:09:45.065 --> 01:09:46.152
they're gonna fuck with us.

973
01:09:46.153 --> 01:09:48.295
Hey! Hey, ladies.

Hey, how about you sit the fuck back down

How about you just chill out, man?
Be cool.

978
01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.214
You should've seen the look in his eyes.

979
01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:21.158
His heart was breaking
for this poor little thing.

980
01:10:21.159 --> 01:10:25.734
Shit, that boy Ian don't seem
like he got no balls at all.

981
01:10:25.735 --> 01:10:29.894
Why? 'Cause he got to fussing some
over a suffering critter?

982
01:10:30.119 --> 01:10:31.845
I think that's real sweet.

983
01:10:31.846 --> 01:10:35.046
Well, I say this Lance,
he sounds like a real hunk of man.

984
01:10:35.047 --> 01:10:38.061
But he got no respect for bitches.

985
01:10:38.183 --> 01:10:43.368
Shathayd's right. No respect for bitches.
None whatsoever.

986
01:10:43.878 --> 01:10:46.891
You love Ian, don't you, baby?

987
01:10:49.157 --> 01:10:53.987
Well, it's just we've been best friends
since we were really little,

988
01:10:53.988 --> 01:10:57.412
and I don't know, he's the only person
I can really talk to, you know?

989
01:10:57.413 --> 01:11:03.459
When I was a girl, my best friend was
a fella named Creighton McDaniel.

990
01:11:03.717 --> 01:11:09.731
We used to stay up all night just talking
and laughing and carrying on.

991
01:11:10.341 --> 01:11:14.565
Then one day I got it into my head
that we ought to be more than friends.

992
01:11:14.788 --> 01:11:17.540
So I tell him I love him.

993
01:11:17.541 --> 01:11:19.649
What happened?

994
01:11:21.732 --> 01:11:24.713
We dated for a few weeks.

995
01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.721
Then he met a gal over in Wofford.

996
01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:31.367
We still talk from time to time.

997
01:11:31.843 --> 01:11:34.943
But it was never the same between us.

998
01:11:41.155 --> 01:11:47.879
Baby. Come here.
Come on, now. Come on, now.

999
01:11:49.058 --> 01:11:52.966
You know you need a hug.
Come on, honey.

1000
01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:54.816
Cuddle up.

1001
01:11:59.043 --> 01:12:00.671
LANCE: Dude.

1002
01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:05.601
- What?
- Look, you're pissing in front of everybody.

1003
01:12:07.586 --> 01:12:09.152
Yeah, I am.

1004
01:12:09.153 --> 01:12:12.995
- And that guy's looking right at your dick.
- Atta-boy.

1005
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.512
- Look at you. You're a new man.
- No, I'm not.

1006
01:12:20.513 --> 01:12:26.175
Dude. You stole a car, you got arrested,
you got in a prison fight.

1007
01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:28.703
And now you're in here pissing
like a big dog.

1008
01:12:28.704 --> 01:12:30.655
I mean, there's only one thing left.

1009
01:12:30.656 --> 01:12:34.466
Yeah, well, that's out.
I was supposed to meet her two hours ago.

1010
01:12:34.592 --> 01:12:37.054
Dude, when we get out of here,
just tell her you got pinched.

1011
01:12:37.055 --> 01:12:40.485
She'll think that's bad-ass, because it is.

1012
01:12:40.992 --> 01:12:44.001
Lafferty, Nesbitt, your bail has been posted.

1013
01:12:44.002 --> 01:12:45.023
Really?

1014
01:12:45.024 --> 01:12:50.046
- Time to go.
- Shit!

1015
01:12:50.047 --> 01:12:53.060
- What?
- Rex.

1016
01:12:53.118 --> 01:12:54.812
Oh.

1017
01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:59.932
All right, Duane, I'm gonna go to your
MySpace page and listen to your album.

1018
01:12:59.933 --> 01:13:04.956
And I hope to see you soon
in better circumstances.

1019
01:13:14.526 --> 01:13:16.514
- Hey.
- Mary!

1020
01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.828
Wait. Wait. How did you find me?

1021
01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:23.709
Well, I called your cell phone,
and then someone answered here.

1022
01:13:23.710 --> 01:13:29.539
- That's awesome. Okay.
- Are you okay? Why are you in jail?

1023
01:13:31.164 --> 01:13:34.299
I mean, there's a number of charges, but the
most prominent ones were animal cruelty

1024
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.379
and the assaulting the officer.

1025
01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:39.098
But it's not nearly as bad
as it sounds on paper, okay? I promise.

1026
01:13:39.099 --> 01:13:42.715
- Okay.
- Okay. Wait right here. Okay.

1027
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.859
- Teddy, Carol.
- Lance, my man.

1028
01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:47.547
- You guys got my stuff?
- It's gonna be a few minutes.

1029
01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:49.627
All right. I gotta put up with a lot here.

1030
01:13:49.628 --> 01:13:51.645
I was raped last night.
I'm just fucking with you.

1031
01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:56.927
Oh, man. But one guy did get raped.

1032
01:14:21.433 --> 01:14:24.729
<i>You can't know, oh, no
You can't know</i>

1033
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:30.559
<i>How much I think about you, no</i>

1034
01:14:31.193 --> 01:14:34.720
<i>It's making my head spin</i>

1035
01:14:37.081 --> 01:14:40.504
<i>Looking at you
And you are looking at me</i>

1036
01:14:40.505 --> 01:14:44.479
<i>And we both know what we want</i>

1037
01:14:46.745 --> 01:14:50.552
<i>So close to giving in</i>

1038
01:14:50.553 --> 01:14:57.814
Ian, don't do this. No,
don't turn into Lance. You're a good guy.

1039
01:14:57.815 --> 01:15:00.054
Yeah, well, that's why I'm still a virgin.

1040
01:15:00.055 --> 01:15:04.725
So what if you're a virgin?
God, Ian, it's just sex. It's not...

1041
01:15:04.726 --> 01:15:09.750
No, Felicia, it's not about the sex.
It's not. I'm weird.

1042
01:15:09.751 --> 01:15:13.973
I'm the only virgin I know.
I need to get this done

1043
01:15:13.974 --> 01:15:17.142
so everyone can just stop
freaking out about it.

1044
01:15:17.143 --> 01:15:19.958
Look, I know you don't approve,
but I'm sorry, I just...

1045
01:15:19.959 --> 01:15:21.846
I'm not going home a virgin.

1046
01:15:21.847 --> 01:15:24.151
Then do it with me.

1047
01:15:25.653 --> 01:15:27.283
What?

1048
01:15:28.535 --> 01:15:31.603
Do it with me and not some stranger.

1049
01:15:32.214 --> 01:15:35.605
We're friends so you know
you're not gonna get some, like,

1050
01:15:35.606 --> 01:15:39.764
crabs or genital warts
or some pussing thing that's coming...

1051
01:15:39.765 --> 01:15:42.866
Wow, Leesh. That's hot!

1052
01:15:44.596 --> 01:15:47.123
You know what?

1053
01:15:47.124 --> 01:15:51.252
I think I'd rather stay a virgin forever
than lose it on pity-sex.

1054
01:15:51.477 --> 01:15:54.390
- I'm not talking about pity-sex.
- Then what are you talking about?

1055
01:15:54.391 --> 01:15:58.036
I don't know. Sex.

1056
01:15:58.037 --> 01:16:04.179
It doesn't have to mean anything.
It doesn't have to jeopardize our friendship.

1057
01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:05.235
Ah!

1058
01:16:05.236 --> 01:16:08.535
Leesh, you know what?
Fuck the friendship!

1059
01:16:08.661 --> 01:16:10.420
I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

1060
01:16:10.421 --> 01:16:14.707
I can't be the guy that you're gonna talk to
about your boyfriends anymore. I can't...

1061
01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:17.107
I can't be the guy who's gonna pick you up
in the middle of the night,

1062
01:16:17.108 --> 01:16:21.496
and you're gonna cry to because
Derrick Dicottes found some other girl.

1063
01:16:22.451 --> 01:16:26.385
And maybe I'm just being selfish here,
but it is not enough.

1064
01:16:26.386 --> 01:16:29.714
Okay, so I'm gonna go out that door,
and I'm gonna go have meaningless sex

1065
01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:35.129
with some random, hopefully hot, hopefully
female person that I met on the Internet.

1066
01:16:36.594 --> 01:16:39.892
Unless you've got something better
to say to me.

1067
01:16:55.825 --> 01:16:58.293
That's what I thought.

1068
01:17:26.863 --> 01:17:29.070
Check out time, dick-cheese.

1069
01:17:29.071 --> 01:17:33.428
- Rex, how'd you find me?
- You ever heard of LoJack, cheese-dick?

1070
01:17:38.575 --> 01:17:39.694
Come here.

1071
01:17:39.695 --> 01:17:42.286
<i>Burn that mother down, y'all</i>

1072
01:17:42.287 --> 01:17:43.981
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

1073
01:17:43.982 --> 01:17:45.741
<i>Disco inferno</i>

1074
01:17:45.742 --> 01:17:47.341
<i>Burn, baby, burn</i>

1075
01:17:47.342 --> 01:17:48.653
<i>Burn that mother down</i>

1076
01:17:48.654 --> 01:17:51.436
Come on, Rex, wait. The girl...
The one I told you about from the Internet.

1077
01:17:51.437 --> 01:17:54.766
She's right across the street, Rex.
She wants to do it with me and everything.

1078
01:17:54.767 --> 01:17:57.104
Like I give a shit!

1079
01:18:08.749 --> 01:18:10.636
Get your shit, queer-bait!
We're going home.

1080
01:18:10.637 --> 01:18:12.491
Okay. Okay, fine.

1081
01:18:12.492 --> 01:18:14.477
Now!

1082
01:18:14.478 --> 01:18:16.364
It probably wouldn't have changed

1083
01:18:16.365 --> 01:18:20.361
all these feelings
that I've been having lately anyway.

1084
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.691
What are you talking about?

1085
01:18:23.692 --> 01:18:28.080
I don't know, Rex. You know, just feelings,

1086
01:18:28.939 --> 01:18:34.407
curiosity about men.

1087
01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.380
Oh, shit, Ian!

1088
01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:44.042
I think you might be right.
I think I might be getting gay.

1089
01:18:44.043 --> 01:18:49.033
Oh, God damn it. Oh, fuck!

1090
01:18:49.611 --> 01:18:52.841
But I just haven't had
any luck with girls, Rex.

1091
01:18:52.842 --> 01:18:57.320
No way! No way my little brother's
taking it in the chili ring.

1092
01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:06.828
All right, you take the car,

1093
01:19:07.018 --> 01:19:09.864
and you go bang a female woman
like the good Lord intended.

1094
01:19:09.865 --> 01:19:12.136
You've got one hour!

1095
01:19:12.137 --> 01:19:14.223
- Ian.
- Yeah?

1096
01:19:16.234 --> 01:19:20.011
- Not up the butt.
- Right.

1097
01:19:41.705 --> 01:19:46.475
Hey, man. You looking for somebody?

1098
01:19:49.479 --> 01:19:51.206
Ms. Tasty.

1099
01:19:52.231 --> 01:19:55.049
MS. TASTY: Ian?

1100
01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:02.374
Oh, my gosh! Hey.

1101
01:20:02.375 --> 01:20:05.388
I was sure you were standing me up.

1102
01:20:06.023 --> 01:20:09.899
- But here you are. Look at you.
- See you.

1103
01:20:10.471 --> 01:20:13.573
You look a little different than your picture.

1104
01:20:13.574 --> 01:20:17.514
Yeah, I know. I lost a lot of weight
'cause I had the runs... The flu.

1105
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:22.664
Well, you're mighty cute,
and your car is really pretty.

1106
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:26.666
Why don't you take me for a ride?

1107
01:20:30.981 --> 01:20:34.955
So, Ms. Tasty, what's your real name?

1108
01:20:36.068 --> 01:20:42.313
- How about I tell you after?
- Yeah, sure.

1109
01:20:43.749 --> 01:20:46.402
Works for me.

1110
01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:59.139
<i>...below the ocean
Where I wanna be</i>

1111
01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.188
<i>She may be</i>

1112
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:04.740
<i>Way down below the ocean...</i>

1113
01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:07.842
- No, Mary, wait.
- What?

1114
01:21:07.843 --> 01:21:11.714
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I mean...

1115
01:21:11.715 --> 01:21:16.006
Nothing, I just... I really like you,

1116
01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:22.947
and I don't want to ruin this. You know?

1117
01:21:23.267 --> 01:21:28.129
But, hey, maybe you could come
to Chicago and we could hang out

1118
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:29.985
- and take it a little...
- No.

1119
01:21:29.986 --> 01:21:34.015
Lance, it doesn't work like that.

1120
01:21:36.962 --> 01:21:40.936
And, I mean, if I don't go back,
I'm gonna be shunned.

1121
01:21:41.665 --> 01:21:44.550
I could never see my family again.

1122
01:21:45.378 --> 01:21:50.148
- This Amish thing is a real motherfucker.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

1123
01:21:58.304 --> 01:22:00.030
- Ian.
- Yeah.

1124
01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:03.330
I think we should take our clothes off.

1125
01:22:03.968 --> 01:22:05.632
Wow. Really? Right here?

1126
01:22:05.633 --> 01:22:07.136
Mmm-hmm.

1127
01:22:07.137 --> 01:22:10.849
No one's around for miles. Come on.

1128
01:22:10.912 --> 01:22:12.671
Okay.

1129
01:22:18.975 --> 01:22:22.174
- What do you think?
- Ample.

1130
01:22:22.175 --> 01:22:24.064
Mmm-hmm.

1131
01:22:25.344 --> 01:22:27.935
I think we should take
your clothes off now.

1132
01:22:27.936 --> 01:22:31.102
Yeah, maybe we should.

1133
01:22:31.103 --> 01:22:35.901
- I don't play football!
- Okay.

1134
01:22:35.902 --> 01:22:38.141
I... I really don't.
I mean, I don't even really watch football.

1135
01:22:38.142 --> 01:22:40.252
<i>I mean, I got all that stuff
from Friday Night Lights,</i>

1136
01:22:40.253 --> 01:22:43.164
which is a show. It's also a movie
starring Billy Bob Thornton.

1137
01:22:43.165 --> 01:22:45.149
- I don't know if you saw it, but...
- Ian.

1138
01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:51.037
What? You think everything in my profile's
the God's honest truth? No.

1139
01:22:51.038 --> 01:22:54.499
Now, come on, take your clothes off.

1140
01:22:56.126 --> 01:23:01.060
Look, there's this girl...

1141
01:23:01.597 --> 01:23:06.336
Ian, this can be our little secret.
No one has to know.

1142
01:23:07.262 --> 01:23:09.370
Now come here.

1143
01:23:21.179 --> 01:23:26.168
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I can't do this with you.

1144
01:23:26.363 --> 01:23:31.299
I'm kissing you,
and I'm thinking about somebody else.

1145
01:23:31.739 --> 01:23:36.160
No, and I know that's a stupid thing to say.
I mean, she's not even...

1146
01:23:37.243 --> 01:23:41.021
Oh, no, no, no. Ms. Tasty, please don't cry.

1147
01:23:41.211 --> 01:23:45.497
It's not a reflection of...
You're so pretty, like...

1148
01:23:45.498 --> 01:23:47.193
You're laughing.

1149
01:23:47.194 --> 01:23:50.722
Just take your fucking clothes off, asshole!

1150
01:23:51.099 --> 01:23:54.425
Look, I'm sorry, okay.
I don't mean to lead you on here,

1151
01:23:54.426 --> 01:23:58.585
and I'll give you a ride home,
but I don't think that... What the fuck?

1152
01:23:58.586 --> 01:24:01.305
You heard the lady. Strip.

1153
01:24:03.673 --> 01:24:07.319
- Do you have any jacks?
- Yup.

1154
01:24:07.993 --> 01:24:11.448
- I win.
- Oh! Again.

1155
01:24:11.449 --> 01:24:13.077
Yup.

1156
01:24:16.825 --> 01:24:19.926
- All right, just take your shirt off.
- Okay, good.

1157
01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:26.970
You were right, Ian. '69 Judge.
You were worth the wait.

1158
01:24:29.079 --> 01:24:34.615
- Please, no! Come on, it's not even my car!
- Oh, and good luck with the lady friend.

1159
01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:42.046
Felicia. Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1160
01:24:43.223 --> 01:24:46.197
Now, listen. I got another car coming
any minute now, okay?

1161
01:24:46.198 --> 01:24:47.893
- Got it.
- So take me back to the Big Boy

1162
01:24:47.894 --> 01:24:50.877
- and get this goat over to Luis.
- Right.

1163
01:24:51.511 --> 01:24:57.656
And where is Luis? 5th and Crescent!

1164
01:24:57.751 --> 01:24:59.893
- I fucking told you.
- I know where it is.

1165
01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:04.022
Shit!

1166
01:25:14.806 --> 01:25:16.500
Hi.

1167
01:25:21.558 --> 01:25:25.044
- Hey, boys. You finally made it.
- What's up, Ms. Tasty?

1168
01:25:25.045 --> 01:25:27.539
What's up? What's up?

1169
01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.131
- Damn, you're hot as fuck.
- Yeah.

1170
01:25:30.132 --> 01:25:34.522
- We brought beers and rubbers.
- And some lotion for your tits.

1171
01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:53.626
I can't believe I'm banging an Amish chick.
I mean, seriously, what are the odds?

1172
01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:56.599
Oh, yeah! More of that.

1173
01:25:58.228 --> 01:26:03.315
So, wait, you do want to party?

1174
01:26:03.443 --> 01:26:04.594
With us?

1175
01:26:04.595 --> 01:26:08.209
Yeah. I want us all to get naked and party.

1176
01:26:26.802 --> 01:26:30.198
Get your ass out of the car, motherfucker!

1177
01:26:31.282 --> 01:26:36.178
- Who the fuck are you?
- Holy fucking fuck-balls!

1178
01:26:36.179 --> 01:26:40.113
Okay, my bad.

1179
01:26:40.114 --> 01:26:41.712
Now, I thought you were someone else,
all right?

1180
01:26:41.713 --> 01:26:47.542
You done fouled up my ride,
so I'm gonna have to take yours.

1181
01:26:47.728 --> 01:26:48.847
Fuck that shit.

1182
01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:52.307
Here you go. Pulls to the left.

1183
01:26:53.519 --> 01:26:56.109
What the fuck, dumb-ass?

1184
01:26:59.217 --> 01:27:01.903
Oh, shit!

1185
01:27:02.288 --> 01:27:08.367
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, shit!

1186
01:27:08.368 --> 01:27:11.087
Hey, highlights, back it up.

1187
01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:13.843
Bite my dick, asshole!

1188
01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:21.647
Ow! What the fuck you do that for?

1189
01:27:21.648 --> 01:27:24.110
Lance? What the fuck is going on?

1190
01:27:24.111 --> 01:27:25.742
That's the son of a bitch I was looking for!

1191
01:27:25.743 --> 01:27:28.749
Hey, guy. How'd you...

1192
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:32.076
- Found your computer maps, douche-bag!
- Okay.

1193
01:27:32.077 --> 01:27:36.076
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Boat show,
you and your boyfriend bring it in here.

1194
01:27:36.077 --> 01:27:37.358
I don't need no trouble right now.

1195
01:27:37.359 --> 01:27:39.827
Let's go. Bring it in.

1196
01:27:40.526 --> 01:27:44.140
- Bobby Jo, who the fuck is that?
- BOBBY JO: Who?

1197
01:27:44.141 --> 01:27:47.154
- That!
- Son of a bitch!

1198
01:27:48.878 --> 01:27:50.189
Come on, darling.

1199
01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:52.492
- Shut up!
- Now, take it easy on the hair.

1200
01:27:52.493 --> 01:27:55.179
- Get down!
- Hey, hey, come on.

1201
01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:58.861
- All right, all right.
- IAN: Take your hands off her!

1202
01:28:09.132 --> 01:28:12.942
ANDY: Holy loud!
RANDY: People are in the vehicle.

1203
01:28:17.323 --> 01:28:19.727
IAN: Please! No!

1204
01:28:24.812 --> 01:28:27.818
- All right. Get back, man.
- Ian?

1205
01:28:27.819 --> 01:28:30.474
Everybody just be cool.

1206
01:28:30.475 --> 01:28:33.001
- Felicia, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1207
01:28:33.002 --> 01:28:36.009
Ian, give me the goddamn gun
before you shoot your dick off.

1208
01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.225
- Rex, I got this.
- Ian!

1209
01:28:37.226 --> 01:28:41.256
God damn it, Rex, I got this!
Do not fuck with me! Not now!

1210
01:28:41.676 --> 01:28:45.354
Ease it back, man.
That donut ain't fucking around.

1211
01:28:46.346 --> 01:28:49.033
Hands where I can see them.

1212
01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:53.320
- Ian, dude, you're working the mouth.
- I don't give a shit!

1213
01:28:53.321 --> 01:28:57.351
Okay. All right, sorry.
You're doing so good. Proud of you.

1214
01:28:57.352 --> 01:28:59.015
I mean that. I don't say it enough.

1215
01:28:59.016 --> 01:29:03.145
All right, you, corn-fed, you can
punch my friend Lance, but just once.

1216
01:29:03.146 --> 01:29:06.280
- Dude! What the fuck?
- You nailed his girlfriend.

1217
01:29:06.281 --> 01:29:09.352
- Not exactly. I mean, it was...
- And he came all this way.

1218
01:29:09.353 --> 01:29:13.415
All right. All right, fair enough.
Just not in the nuts.

1219
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:21.899
- Oh, shit!
- Okay. Okay, all right.

1220
01:29:22.953 --> 01:29:27.591
What a punch.
I think my kids are gonna be retarded.

1221
01:29:27.592 --> 01:29:29.447
You got a fucking cannon for an arm, dude.

1222
01:29:29.448 --> 01:29:35.174
- Yeah, you got a little...
- Thanks. My ears are ringing.

1223
01:29:35.175 --> 01:29:37.030
IAN: Stop it! I'm warning you!

1224
01:29:37.031 --> 01:29:40.293
Come on, bro. You ain't gonna kill no one.

1225
01:29:41.734 --> 01:29:43.364
BOBBY JO: Whoa!

1226
01:29:44.903 --> 01:29:48.070
- Anybody can shoot a gun in the air, dude.
- I'll shoot you in the leg.

1227
01:29:48.071 --> 01:29:50.506
Smoke that cock, Ian!

1228
01:29:51.142 --> 01:29:53.029
I don't think you got the plums, boy.

1229
01:29:56.326 --> 01:29:58.980
God!

1230
01:30:04.391 --> 01:30:07.274
Okay. Okay.

1231
01:30:08.422 --> 01:30:11.851
Anybody can shoot someone
in the leg, dude.

1232
01:30:12.326 --> 01:30:16.169
- Give me the gun!
- Jesus, man, what do I got to do?

1233
01:30:18.373 --> 01:30:21.315
Don't move, asshole,
or you're a fucking stain.

1234
01:30:21.316 --> 01:30:23.075
Okay.

1235
01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:26.916
Holy shit, Ian. Right on!

1236
01:30:26.917 --> 01:30:29.155
Where do you think you're going, bitch?

1237
01:30:29.156 --> 01:30:30.564
Cat fight!

1238
01:30:32.612 --> 01:30:36.291
<i>'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1239
01:30:36.292 --> 01:30:37.891
FELICIA: Damn you, whore!

1240
01:30:37.892 --> 01:30:39.587
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>

1241
01:30:39.588 --> 01:30:41.827
Fuck you!

1242
01:30:43.044 --> 01:30:47.459
<i>And if I have to crawl upon the floor</i>

1243
01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.700
<i>Come crashing through your door</i>

1244
01:30:50.883 --> 01:30:57.345
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>

1245
01:30:57.346 --> 01:31:00.033
Drop the weapon, donut man!

1246
01:31:00.738 --> 01:31:03.041
Okay, put your hands on your head!

1247
01:31:03.042 --> 01:31:06.530
- Both hands, asshole!
- IAN: I can't move the other arm.

1248
01:31:06.531 --> 01:31:10.756
- Who said that? Who said that?
- I can't move the other arm.

1249
01:31:12.866 --> 01:31:15.873
Sir, I'm not resisting. It's foam, sir.

1250
01:31:19.425 --> 01:31:23.748
The big Mexican won't go down!
Take the shot!

1251
01:31:23.809 --> 01:31:25.472
- Holy shit.
- Jesus!

1252
01:31:25.473 --> 01:31:28.289
Hold your fire! Hold your fire, okay?

1253
01:31:28.290 --> 01:31:32.613
He is not the bad guy! She is the car thief.

1254
01:31:32.929 --> 01:31:37.023
Right there. The blond, in a belt for a skirt.

1255
01:31:44.255 --> 01:31:46.364
FEMALE OFFICER: Anything else?

1256
01:31:47.391 --> 01:31:50.271
FELICIA: Oh, yeah,
apparently there's a guy named Luis,

1257
01:31:50.272 --> 01:31:53.886
and he has a chop shop
at 5th and Crescent!

1258
01:31:53.952 --> 01:31:55.039
Thanks.

1259
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.414
We were just banging that chick in our car.

1260
01:31:56.415 --> 01:31:59.486
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Yeah, super hard.

1261
01:31:59.487 --> 01:32:05.342
The boy did have some plums.
He had some plums.

1262
01:32:05.343 --> 01:32:08.445
Hey, this is Rick.
He's played arena football.

1263
01:32:08.446 --> 01:32:10.751
- Hi. I'm Mary.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

1264
01:32:10.752 --> 01:32:12.415
That's a weird little dude you got there.

1265
01:32:12.416 --> 01:32:13.471
LANCE: Are you guys hungry?

1266
01:32:13.472 --> 01:32:16.223
Is this place open 24 hours?

1267
01:32:17.823 --> 01:32:20.957
Thank you for coming for me.

1268
01:32:21.342 --> 01:32:24.285
What were you doing in the back seat?

1269
01:32:24.286 --> 01:32:27.420
Nothing. I was...

1270
01:32:27.421 --> 01:32:31.899
- You were stalking me.
- No, I wasn't. I...

1271
01:32:32.989 --> 01:32:36.964
Okay. Yeah, I was stalking you just a little.

1272
01:32:37.725 --> 01:32:41.180
I just... I knew you were gonna do
something you were gonna regret, and I...

1273
01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:45.853
Felicia. Why can't you just say it?

1274
01:32:50.011 --> 01:32:54.369
- Why can't you?
- Well, I asked you first.

1275
01:33:01.436 --> 01:33:03.740
Fine. I'll say it.

1276
01:33:09.434 --> 01:33:13.596
- You love me.
- Fine.

1277
01:33:14.971 --> 01:33:16.826
You love me, too, then.

1278
01:33:21.658 --> 01:33:27.967
<i>Life is beautiful</i>

1279
01:33:29.721 --> 01:33:33.466
<i>But it's complicated</i>

1280
01:33:33.467 --> 01:33:34.522
Thank God.

1281
01:33:34.523 --> 01:33:39.424
<i>We barely make it</i>

1282
01:33:51.256 --> 01:33:53.433
You fucking heifer.

1283
01:34:06.329 --> 01:34:07.895
- You fixed it!
- Yeah.

1284
01:34:07.896 --> 01:34:10.136
Don't lean on it.

1285
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.072
I guess you get to live.

1286
01:34:14.073 --> 01:34:17.048
- IAN: You guys are amazing.
- Thanks.

1287
01:34:17.049 --> 01:34:18.583
Let's talk seriously for a second.

1288
01:34:18.584 --> 01:34:24.532
I figure with the parts and labor,
you know, out the door... 4,200.

1289
01:34:25.943 --> 01:34:27.126
Oh. Um...

1290
01:34:27.127 --> 01:34:28.181
It's just a round number.

1291
01:34:28.182 --> 01:34:31.228
Yeah. No, I didn't really...

1292
01:34:34.582 --> 01:34:35.895
I don't know what to...

1293
01:34:35.896 --> 01:34:38.870
I'm fucking with you, Ian. We're good, man.

1294
01:34:38.871 --> 01:34:42.901
- Wait, I mean, you're serious?
- Yeah. I'm serious. We're good. No worries.

1295
01:34:42.902 --> 01:34:44.244
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

1296
01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:45.269
- Thank you, man.
- It's what I live for,

1297
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:48.405
fixing other people's shit for free.

1298
01:34:50.646 --> 01:34:52.372
Yeah.

1299
01:34:56.982 --> 01:34:59.446
- Hey.
- REX: Straight home, pussy!

1300
01:34:59.447 --> 01:35:03.637
- Dude, we got to go.
- REX: Fucking piece of shit!

1301
01:35:03.638 --> 01:35:07.220
You go on ahead.
I think I'm gonna stay here, kick it Amish.

1302
01:35:07.221 --> 01:35:09.107
Dude, what are you talking about?

1303
01:35:09.108 --> 01:35:13.170
I don't know, a little hard work,
fresh air, missionary position.

1304
01:35:13.299 --> 01:35:15.026
It's a man's life.

1305
01:35:15.027 --> 01:35:16.725
- Sounds pretty good, you know.
- Yeah, it sounds...

1306
01:35:16.726 --> 01:35:19.925
Come on, Lance. Get serious.

1307
01:35:23.508 --> 01:35:25.529
Come here.

1308
01:35:25.779 --> 01:35:28.595
I gotta tell you, I'm impressed.
I'm proud of you, you know.

1309
01:35:28.596 --> 01:35:32.243
You held out for a good one,
the one you wanted.

1310
01:35:32.372 --> 01:35:35.254
And you fucking made it happen.

1311
01:35:35.859 --> 01:35:40.531
But, please, I'm begging you,
go take that girl to visit Grandma.

1312
01:35:40.532 --> 01:35:42.771
- All right.
- And when you do, don't...

1313
01:35:42.772 --> 01:35:46.517
- Lance, I got it.
- Yeah?

1314
01:35:47.219 --> 01:35:48.945
Yeah.

1315
01:35:50.290 --> 01:35:52.721
Okay. I think you might.

1316
01:35:52.722 --> 01:35:55.092
- See you.
- Bye.

1317
01:36:00.402 --> 01:36:04.241
<i>Well, no, no, me, I never worry</i>

1318
01:36:04.242 --> 01:36:07.408
<i>Because, me, I never try</i>

1319
01:36:07.409 --> 01:36:14.766
<i>And I never care to hold onto
what I just couldn't kiss goodbye</i>

1320
01:36:31.728 --> 01:36:36.116
- Are you sure you're ready?
- Yeah.

1321
01:36:37.487 --> 01:36:40.786
All right, well, come on, take them off.

1322
01:36:51.983 --> 01:36:54.004
Let's do it.

1323
01:37:12.398 --> 01:37:14.637
<i>TIFFANY: Fuck!
Don't start your fucking shit with me.</i>

1324
01:37:14.638 --> 01:37:17.708
You know what? Fuck you!
I want a divorce.

1325
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:20.715
<i>IAN: A few weeks later,
I was Felicia's date to Tiffany's wedding.</i>

1326
01:37:20.716 --> 01:37:24.692
<i>But this time,
it wasn't a just-friends kind of thing.</i>

1327
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:29.618
<i>And Rex did make my life hell for a while.</i>

1328
01:37:29.773 --> 01:37:31.339
<i>But that Thanksgiving,</i>

1329
01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:34.636
<i>we finally found out
what's been up his ass all these years.</i>

1330
01:37:34.637 --> 01:37:38.993
I'm gay! And, so, that's it.

1331
01:37:40.716 --> 01:37:43.212
<i>IAN: By Christmas,
my dad got used to the idea.</i>

1332
01:37:43.213 --> 01:37:46.124
<i>And Rex is actually
a pretty great guy these days.</i>

1333
01:37:46.125 --> 01:37:48.844
<i>Yeah, now he only uses the word faggot
during rough sex.</i>

1334
01:37:48.845 --> 01:37:51.371
Karen and I want you to have this,
for Christmas.

1335
01:37:51.372 --> 01:37:53.961
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.

1336
01:37:55.627 --> 01:37:56.939
A juicer.

1337
01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:02.601
Oh, my gosh! That's so awesome.
Wow, I gotta get some fruit.

1338
01:38:02.602 --> 01:38:04.298
Wow!

1339
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:08.970
Thank you, thank you.

1340
01:38:08.971 --> 01:38:13.002
<i>IAN: And on New Year's Eve,
Felicia and I finally visited Grandma.</i>

1341
01:38:13.003 --> 01:38:15.538
- Again?
- Really?

1342
01:38:16.298 --> 01:38:18.155
<i>IAN: Twice.</i>

1343
01:38:27.403 --> 01:38:29.773
Oh, that was awesome!

1344
01:39:07.721 --> 01:39:11.594
- Hey, boys. You get some rest?
- Thanks, man. Thanks for fixing the bus.

1345
01:39:11.595 --> 01:39:13.319
- A pleasure.
- Yeah, thanks for fixing our bus.

1346
01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:15.721
- Appreciate it.
- Thanks for playing that show for us, too.

1347
01:39:15.722 --> 01:39:18.950
- Yeah, no worries.
- It was a nice five-song set.

1348
01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:21.317
Yeah, what do you guys typically...

1349
01:39:21.318 --> 01:39:23.877
I assume you get compensated
very well for that.

1350
01:39:23.878 --> 01:39:26.692
- Must be a good living.
- Yeah, we do. I mean...

1351
01:39:26.693 --> 01:39:29.542
Yeah, you know, I...
Gosh, if I was really to calculate

1352
01:39:29.543 --> 01:39:32.581
what you'd lose if this bus
couldn't have gotten back on the road,

1353
01:39:32.582 --> 01:39:33.829
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

1354
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:38.630
I imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "I need to dance. "

1355
01:39:38.631 --> 01:39:41.253
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

1356
01:39:41.254 --> 01:39:44.260
- Some autographed photos?
- Or we could give you CDs.

1357
01:39:44.261 --> 01:39:46.468
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

1358
01:39:46.469 --> 01:39:48.742
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

1359
01:39:48.743 --> 01:39:50.501
You guys are some strapping young lads.

1360
01:39:50.502 --> 01:39:53.452
I don't know if we're really built for that.

1361
01:39:54.342 --> 01:39:56.740
- Yeah.
- I can hear you.

1362
01:39:56.741 --> 01:39:58.884
I'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

1363
01:39:58.885 --> 01:40:00.516
- we spent all night on the bus...
- Yeah.

1364
01:40:00.517 --> 01:40:01.828
I mean, that was a lot of work.

1365
01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:04.099
We could maybe try
to write a check later on,

1366
01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:06.146
or like I said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

1367
01:40:06.147 --> 01:40:08.674
City folk are always trying to solve things
with money.

1368
01:40:08.675 --> 01:40:10.756
It's the spirit of the community
around here.

1369
01:40:10.757 --> 01:40:13.219
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

1370
01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.875
Keep him safe on the road.

1371
01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:18.914
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

1372
01:40:18.915 --> 01:40:20.067
- Help him to...
- Thanks.

1373
01:40:20.068 --> 01:40:22.050
- Okay, thanks, man.
- Thanks, man. We gotta roll.

1374
01:40:22.051 --> 01:40:24.003
- Amen.
- We gotta roll, man. Thank you very much.

1375
01:40:24.004 --> 01:40:25.602
All right, boys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

1376
01:40:25.603 --> 01:40:28.513
I loved your penis on the Internet,
by the way.

1377
01:40:28.514 --> 01:40:30.851
- Fucking asshole!
- You're a dick!

1378
01:40:46.018 --> 01:40:49.792
<i>Say my name and his in the same breath</i>

1379
01:40:49.793 --> 01:40:53.185
<i>I dare you to say they taste the same</i>

1380
01:40:53.186 --> 01:40:56.641
<i>Let the leaves fall off in the summer</i>

1381
01:40:56.642 --> 01:41:00.128
<i>And let December glow feel flames</i>

1382
01:41:00.129 --> 01:41:03.169
<i>Brace myself and let go</i>

1383
01:41:03.170 --> 01:41:06.655
<i>Start it over again in Mexico</i>

1384
01:41:06.656 --> 01:41:10.367
<i>These friends, they don't love you</i>

1385
01:41:10.368 --> 01:41:13.953
<i>They just love the hotel suites, now</i>

1386
01:41:13.954 --> 01:41:16.961
<i>I don't care what you think</i>

1387
01:41:16.962 --> 01:41:20.607
<i>As long as it's about me</i>

1388
01:41:20.608 --> 01:41:23.743
<i>The best of us can find happiness</i>

1389
01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:27.134
<i>In misery</i>

1390
01:41:27.135 --> 01:41:30.653
<i>Said, I don't care what you think</i>

1391
01:41:30.654 --> 01:41:34.367
<i>As long as it's about me</i>

1392
01:41:34.368 --> 01:41:37.567
<i>The best of us can find happiness</i>

1393
01:41:37.568 --> 01:41:39.970
<i>In misery</i>

1394
01:41:45.023 --> 01:41:48.478
<i>Oh, take a chance,
let your body get a tolerance</i>

1395
01:41:48.479 --> 01:41:51.325
<i>I'm not a chance,
but a heat wave in your pants</i>

1396
01:41:51.326 --> 01:41:53.854
<i>Pull a breath like another cigarette</i>

1397
01:41:53.855 --> 01:41:56.923
<i>Palms up, I'm trading 'em</i>

1398
01:41:57.024 --> 01:41:58.846
<i>Trading 'em</i>

1399
01:41:58.847 --> 01:42:02.205
<i>I'm the oracle in my chest</i>

1400
01:42:02.206 --> 01:42:05.053
<i>Let the guitar scream like a fascist</i>

1401
01:42:05.054 --> 01:42:06.748
<i>Sweat it out, shut your mouth</i>

1402
01:42:06.749 --> 01:42:08.540
<i>Free love on the streets</i>

1403
01:42:08.541 --> 01:42:12.476
<i>But in the alley and I ain't that cheap, now</i>

1404
01:42:12.477 --> 01:42:15.887
<i>I don't care what you think</i>

1405
01:42:15.888 --> 01:42:19.228
<i>As long as it's about me</i>

1406
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:22.236
<i>The best of us can find happiness</i>

1407
01:42:22.237 --> 01:42:25.628
<i>In misery</i>

1408
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:29.211
<i>Said, I don't care what you think</i>

1411
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.335
<i>In misery</i>

1412
01:42:49.659 --> 01:42:53.306
<i>Said I don't care just what you think</i>

1413
01:42:53.307 --> 01:42:56.539
<i>As long as it's about me</i>

1414
01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:59.866

1419
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:17.754
<i>No, I don't</i>

1420
01:43:17.755 --> 01:43:21.049
<i>I don't care, I don't care</i>

1430

<i>BRAND Y'S DAD: This is a serious matter.</i>

1431
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:47.092
Run for your life.

1432
01:44:47.093 --> 01:44:49.460
MAN 1: Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

1433
01:44:50.869 --> 01:44:54.298
MAN 2: All right. We'll shoot another. Cut.
MAN 3: Cut.
