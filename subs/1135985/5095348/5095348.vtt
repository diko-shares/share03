1
00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.473
We open up against
Michigan in two weeks.

2
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:26.353
Coach's got me hitting the bench
pretty hard.

3
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.649
Shit. How much is a lot?

4
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.493
One... No, two.

5
00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:45.952
I'm putting up three hundy.

6
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.296
Well, let's see, Tasty.

7
00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:03.726
Wow!

8
00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.388
Um...

9
00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:11.151
Wow, you're really pretty.
I've never seen...

10
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.736
No, stop it, stop it.

11
00:01:12.823 --> 00:01:16.566
Don't be so fucking desperate.
Come on, be a dick. Be cool.

12
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.237
Don't be
a pussy. Tell her she's an ugly skank.

13
00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.870
Yeah.

14
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.167
Not bad.

15
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.790
I've seen better.

16
00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.759
Yeah, whatever.

17
00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:42.433
Coach's got us running two-a-days,
so I got to bounce.

18
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.372
Miss Tasty? How did you get here?

19
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:11.707
Shh!

20
00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.706
Ian, wake up, faggot. Judge rolls in 20,

21
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.879
so if you want a ride to work
you better get your poop in a group.

22
00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:39.083
- Okay, I'll be right down.
- No. Now, Clay Aiken.

23
00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:41.501
Hey...

24
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.212
- Ow! Cut it out.
- Hurts, doesn't it?

25
00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:46.389
Shut up! I'm trying to sleep.

26
00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.718
Hey, sorry, Big D. Just go back to sleep.

27
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:52.225
- You, get up.
- Give me a minute.

28
00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:53.475
What are you hiding?

29
00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.558
You got a big fattie under
there, don't you?

30
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.895
Yeah, you do. You're stroking it, too.
Oh! What the F?

31
00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.484
Good. My boys are all here.

32
00:04:02.576 --> 00:04:04.532
- Dad, Ian's free...
- Can it, Rex.

33
00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.032
Your pop's got a bombshell to drop,
so ears open.

34
00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:11.081
Last night,
your old man popped the question.

35
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:13.909
Show them, Karen.

36
00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.334
I'm so happy.

37
00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.134
Hey, way to go!

38
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.588
Ian, you wanna get off your duff
and come over here and give Karen a hug?

39
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:27.718
Um...

40
00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:31.427
- Yeah, Ian, get up. You're being rude.
- Can we do that later?

41
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.809
- Damn it, Ian, get up...
- No, no, honey. It's okay.

42
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.939
We have to give him time
to get used to the idea.

43
00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:43.279
- Karen?
- Are you okay?

44
00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.322
- Karen? Karen, honey?
- You okay?

45
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.991
Sweetheart?

46
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.943
What smells like jizz?

47
00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.914
Let's go! Kick it in the ass, dildo!

48
00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:10.220
Come on, get in. Get in!

49
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:19.853
You suck!

50
00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:25.026
Okay, seriously.
Quit being such a fag and get in.

51
00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.752
Ian, I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want a straight answer.

52
00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.505
- You queer?
- What?

53
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.049
- God damn it! I knew it!
- I didn't say anything.

54
00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:47.422
Exactly. If someone asks you
if you're a pole smoker,

55
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.927
you just deny it, straight off.
No pause, no farting around.

56
00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.097
Rex, I'm not gay.

57
00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:55.302
Ian, you're 18,
and you've never had a girlfriend.

58
00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:58.059
That's how people wind up getting gay,
you know.

59
00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.105
I don't think that's really how it happens.

60
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.559
Is that not how it happens?
So tell me how it happens, expert.

61
00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.066
Fucking cock expert. Cockspert.

62
00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.147
Hey, what do you like better,
the shaft or the balls?

63
00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:09.278
That's gross.
I don't know why you're talking about it.

64
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.610
Look, every guy's got a fantasy
about another guy,

65
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:15.414
but you got to bury that shit way down.
This is America, God damn it.

66
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.493
There is...
There is a girl that I've been kind of...

67
00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.455
All right, I'm listening.
Where'd you meet her?

68
00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.130
On the... Online.

69
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:29.294
What? For fuck's sake, Ian,
don't you watch Dateline?

70
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.723
She's probably a guy. Some fat old dude
who wants to ram you in the tailpipe.

71
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.394
But you'd love that, wouldn't you?
'Cause you're a homo.

72
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.774
Try not to come home any gayer
than you are now.

73
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:49.296
- Hey, Becca. How are you?
- I'm good. I'm fine. Whatever.

74
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:53.504
Hey, Becca.
Looks like you had a long, nasty night.

75
00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:57.432
- Ron and Ian want the four-one-uno.
- Whatever. You guys are gross.

76
00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:02.058
- I'm not gross. I didn't say anything.
- Okay, who's going on coupon rounds?

77
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.939
- No, Becca, I did it yesterday.
- Please, Ian.

78
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.946
I love you so much.

79
00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:17.744
Hello. This is a coupon for six
free... No? Okay. Sorry. Donuts? No.

80
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.405
- Six free donuts with the Bandito's Dozen.
- Thanks.

81
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.081
You're welcome. Sorry.

82
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.994
Excuse me. Do you know where the Gap is?

83
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:30.128
- It's just past the movie theater.
- Thanks, man.

84
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.053
Yeah, real funny.

85
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.972
Free donuts, free coupons.

86
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.562
Felicia. How's it fitting, hon?

87
00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:00.111
Well, you look nice.

88
00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:02.993
You know, sweetie,
there's still time to have your boobs done

89
00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:04.199
before my wedding.

90
00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.751
Darren and I already discussed them,
and he said he'd pay for it.

91
00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:10.001
I mean, he's a dentist,
so it's totally not a big deal.

92
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.466
Excuse me, do you have a pair of scissors?

93
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.589
Oh! Sure, sweetie. Do you have a stringie?

94
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.172
Oh, no. I was just hoping
you could slit my wrists for me quickly.

95
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:22.054
My husband killed himself last Christmas.

96
00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:27.397
I am so sorry. I was just...

97
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:32.269
Hello. This is a coupon
for six free donuts. Donuts?

98
00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:38.946
Oh, my God! You look so hot in that.

99
00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.324
Hey, sweetheart, listen.
Please don't take this the wrong way,

100
00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.326
but your whole trying too hard thing,

101
00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.079
it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

102
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.456
And I think you're better than that,
Kimberly.

103
00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:54.462
- But all I was saying was that...
- Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?

104
00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:56.592
I mean, Christ,
I'm out buying him clothes right now.

105
00:09:56.679 --> 00:10:00.547
He's 18 years old.
I don't have to do that shit anymore.

106
00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:05.181
Look, Judy, listen, I'm sorry,
I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.

107
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:10.482
Well, it's official, Lance,
your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

108
00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:12.854
What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

109
00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.813
No, actually, she doesn't.
She doesn't, ever.

110
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.740
All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

111
00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.785
Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

112
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:25.580
And whatever you do, man,
always wear a rubber. Christ.

113
00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.454
Nice. Always classy.

114
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:32.333
Hey, come on, Lance,
I didn't mean it like... Come on, dawg.

115
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.878
Hey, sir. I've got something yummy
for your little girl.

116
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:46.392
Oh, my God. Excuse me! Sorry!

117
00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:55.769
- Ian? Oh, my God, dude, what happened?
- I don't know.

118
00:10:55.864 --> 00:10:58.230
Is there a cock and balls
on the front of me again?

119
00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.815
- Like a little tree trunk.
- Thank you.

120
00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.818
Oh, my God.

121
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:10.750
- Whoa. You look pretty.
- God, shut up, Ian!

122
00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:14.705
What? I'm just saying,
you usually dress so... You look nice.

123
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:17.131
Ian, why do you got to work the mouth
when you talk to us?

124
00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:20.676
- Yeah, Ian.
- Sorry, it's a... It's a habit.

125
00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:23.800
Hey, that girl you work with, Becca,
you gonna bring her to my party tonight?

126
00:11:23.892 --> 00:11:28.556
- Yeah, I asked her. She said no.
- Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.

127
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:31.103
That's what you say about everyone.

128
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.182
She made you wear
the fucking costume again, right?

129
00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.688
- You know, I don't mind...
- Dude, if you told her to fuck off,

130
00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:39.066
she'd be two knuckles deep right now
day dreaming about your big black cock.

131
00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.363
Ian, do not listen to him.

132
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.112
Okay, girls want a nice guy
who's gonna treat them well.

133
00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.818
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

134
00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:47.120
Look, all I'm saying is
everybody wants a challenge.

135
00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.573
- Everybody wants...
- What they can't get. I know, I got it.

136
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:53.580
- That shit does not work.
- It works on you.

137
00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.457
No, it doesn't.

138
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.509
Felicia!

139
00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:05.547
Balls! I got to go.
Evil cousin's spending the weekend.

140
00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:08.475
- Pretty cousin?
- Ian, she's the anti-Christ.

141
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.678
- She's still super hot.
- Fuck you, too. See you.

142
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:13.812
So what happened with Becca?

143
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.481
You been doing like I told you,
being a dick?

144
00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:20.028
Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick.
I'd say... No, not really.

145
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.901
I mean, you know,
I've sort of been practicing

146
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.200
your whole being-a-dick thing
with this girl I met online.

147
00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.243
- And I get it, but I just...
- Thanks.

148
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.117
I don't think I could do that for real.

149
00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.290
Dude, sure you can.
I believe in you, you know.

150
00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:36.120
You just got to stop worrying
about being the good guy all the time.

151
00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.296
I mean, okay,
look at Andy and Randy over there.

152
00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.248
You think they care
what women think about them?

153
00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.254
They could give a fuck.

154
00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:45.587
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

155
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:49.015
Hi. I'm collecting for
the underprivileged children of Ecuador.

156
00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:51.434
- Would you like to help?
- You wanna party?

157
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.807
Um... I'm kind of working right now.

158
00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.230
- When are you done?
- Yeah, what are you doing after?

159
00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.853
I have a church thing tonight.

160
00:12:57.944 --> 00:12:59.855
- Kick ass, we'll come.
- Yeah, where is it?

161
00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:01.937
Is there gonna be
more hot snatch like you there?

162
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:05.023
Those guys are total nards.
They never get anywhere.

163
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.029
That's just 'cause they don't know
how to close.

164
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.735
But they're ability to open
is fucking heroic.

165
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.617
- Do you wear thong underpants?
- Do you want us to take our shirts off?

166
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.448
- Where do you live?
- Is your mom hot, too?

167
00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.204
- Where do you live?
- What's your address?

168
00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:16.956
- Do you want us to come over?
- Do you like pizza?

169
00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:18.911
We've been to a motel.

170
00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:26.461
- Fuck off, donut.
- Rex, it's me.

171
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.635
What the fuck is this all about?

172
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:33.594
I broke the key off of our locker.
I couldn't get my clothes out.

173
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:37.556
Stow that shit in the trunk.
Christ, you look like a Mexican butt-hole.

174
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.107
You suck.

175
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.525
Becca? Hey.

176
00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.954
Wow, I didn't know
that you were coming over.

177
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:58.998
Cool. I didn't even know
that you knew where I lived. I mean...

178
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.704
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah.

179
00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:05.212
- So...
- Oh! It's a funny story. I broke...

180
00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:09.091
I broke my key off
and Ron let me borrow the...

181
00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:12.891
Anyway, so this is great.
You changed your mind.

182
00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.183
Now, the party, it doesn't start

183
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.104
- for a few hours.
- Actually, I was wondering if Dylan's here.

184
00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.900
- Dylan?
- Yeah. Is he here?

185
00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:25.353
- My 14-year-old brother Dylan?
- Yeah.

186
00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:30.408
- Nice underpants, Ian.
- Snap! Dang, that was funny.

187
00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:32.486
You know he's 14, right?

188
00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:56.468
Ian, dude, there's like 80 wet chicks here.
Get off your wallflower ass.

189
00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:59.520
- Are you smoking cigars now?
- Yes.

190
00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.849
- Hey, Lance. Tight party.
- Okay, rude.

191
00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.730
You can see
I'm having a conversation here.

192
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:07.733
Now, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

193
00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.155
- Thank you.
- We're sorry.

194
00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.198
- Don't apologize to her.
- I'm sorry.

195
00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:12.741
Don't apologize to me.

196
00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.282
Hey, I'm gonna go see
who Felicia's talking to.

197
00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:21.584
No, dude, forget Felicia, okay?

198
00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.707
I know you guys are BFF and all that shit,

199
00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:26.130
but tonight's about getting that dick
a little daylight.

200
00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.253
Hey, Lindsay, sweetheart,
where you going?

201
00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.756
Come here, we're not done. Get in here.

202
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:34.681
- You know my boy Ian?
- Yeah. No. I don't know.

203
00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:38.931
- You used to be on my paper route.
- Okay, sure. My mom likes you.

204
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.058
You know what else
about our boy Ian here?

205
00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.683
Ian is a bust-ass virgin.

206
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.945
- I'm so sorry.
- He's fresh meat.

207
00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.943
Yeah. No, I'm pretty stoked.
I got into the University of Wisconsin,

208
00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:57.244
and I'm gonna go for veterinary medicine,
'cause that's where...

209
00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:59.743
- Are you gonna go to college?
- University of Boulder.

210
00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.495
It's a great party school.

211
00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:06.956
Oh, you know, I read that they have
a really great astronomy program.

212
00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.960
I don't know if that's
what you're going there for or...

213
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:14.717
Because it's really high elevation,
and you can see the stars really well...

214
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.845
Planets.

215
00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:22.929
Wow! A little tip action there.
That's really suggestive.

216
00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:26.232
I'm not saying that
you're gonna do that on my, well...

217
00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:29.152
There, what, you're gonna... Two in there.

218
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:31.395
- Wow, you're really...
- Ian! Dude!

219
00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:35.533
I'm... Could you excuse me for a second?

220
00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:40.280
- Hey!
- Hey! What up?

221
00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:44.117
- What are you doing in there, man?
- What're you doing out here, man?

222
00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.999
- I asked you first.
- Uh... Nothing.

223
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:50.832
No, I just... I spilled beer on my shirt,
so then I had to...

224
00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:55.842
- I thought you had, like, a girl in there.
- Yeah, right. I wish.

225
00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:59.470
So, okay.
So, are your parents, like, still going

226
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.596
to Dylan's motor-cross thing this weekend?

227
00:17:01.729 --> 00:17:03.344
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They all take off in the morning.

228
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:04.679
Okay. Awesome.

229
00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:09.734
'Cause my evil cousin is driving me nuts,
so, I don't know,

230
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.983
you think, like, maybe I could hang
at your place this weekend?

231
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.731
Yeah. Yeah, like a sleepover or something.
It'll be fun.

232
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:22.117
Oh, my God! Thank you so much.
Hey, I have a secret.

233
00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:28.003
- Look at you acting like such a girl.
- I know, I know. Okay, okay. Here it is.

234
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.300
I have a crush on someone, a boy, a guy.

235
00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.469
Yeah? Well, who is it?

236
00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:40.344
Come on, you know me better than anyone.
I bet you know who it is.

237
00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:41.970
Come on, guess.

238
00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:45.011
Um...

239
00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.396
I think I know.

240
00:17:55.658 --> 00:18:01.494
I'm kidding. Oh, God! I got you.
You're so easy. You're so easy!

241
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.584
- You're my best friend.
- I know, and you're my best friend.

242
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:12.630
That's why it's funny that we would kiss,
because we wouldn't.

243
00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:18.841
So who is it? Who's the lucky caballero?

244
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.597
Um... Nobody.

245
00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:25.518
- Nobody?
- I... I was kidding, too.

246
00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:28.604
- That is funny.
- It's hilarious.

247
00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:31.023
- That is so funny.
- That is so funny.

248
00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:33.559
Oh! I...

249
00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:34.609
- Oh, you got...
- Yeah.

250
00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:37.234
- All right. So...
- Hey!

251
00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.690
Okay.

252
00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:45.742
Harsh.

253
00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:59.840
- Hey, babe, you wanna party?
- I'm at a party.

254
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.046
Do you wanna make out with us?

255
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.176
Why don't you take a picture, Ian?

256
00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.974
Yeah, and post it on
Totalfuckingawesomeness.com.

257
00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:08.098
Backslash-we-rule!.

258
00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:09.304
Where'd you come up with that?

259
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:14.518
- Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
- You just did.

260
00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:17.354
- Can I ask you another question?
- You just did again.

261
00:19:17.448 --> 00:19:20.611
- What's up? What's up?
- What's up, what's up?

262
00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:25.198
- Dude, where you going?
- Dude, come on. Be a buddy.

263
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:30.374
- I'm... All right, all right.
- You got to get over the monkey.

264
00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:34.625
Where do you guys get the confidence to,
like, hit on every girl you see?

265
00:19:34.715 --> 00:19:38.333
- 'Cause we're the shit.
- Yeah, you oughts to know that, bitch.

266
00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:41.840
- So where's Felicia?
- Fel-ate-cha. Yeah.

267
00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:46.174
- She's in...
- Fe-lay-cha! You banging her?

268
00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.600
We're just friends.

269
00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.179
- I'm uncircumcised.
- Fuck off!

270
00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.013
Wait, I thought you took her to prom.

271
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:56.101
Yeah,
but it was a just-friends kind of thing.

272
00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:02.610
You should bang her. We would.

273
00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.324
Dude, we would bang her so hard.

274
00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.528
Yeah, tell her we'll bang her for you
if you're not into it.

275
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:07.987
Yeah. Hard.

276
00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:10.331
- With our dicks!
- Yeah, our dicks are huge.

277
00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:11.373
You could see them from space!

278
00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:14.201
- What's up?
- What's up?

279
00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:22.255
I'll call you from nationals.

280
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.136
- Say it.
- You're my little donut girl.

281
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:35.977
- Bye, sexy.
- Yo, Ian.

282
00:20:37.111 --> 00:20:40.945
- You want to smell my finger?
- Yeah, okay.

283
00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:47.694
Are you sure you got the right hole?

284
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.835
Awesome.

285
00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.844
Hmm... '69.

286
00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:17.438
Whoa.

287
00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:28.193
Don't puss out. Be cool.

288
00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.368
I don't know.

289
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:39.625
That is a long drive, my sugar biscuit!

290
00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:44.800
Sugar biscuit? God, I suck at this.

291
00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.313
Holy buckets.

292
00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.814
She wants me to give her the D.

293
00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:00.785
Dad, what did you do with my helmet?

294
00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:27.279
Ian, honey,
I made you some tollhouse cookies.

295
00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:30.569
I'll just leave these here for you.

296
00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:33.158
I'll get them later.

297
00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:36.495
There's $40 in the cow for fun money,

298
00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:40.866
so be safe and sorry I didn't knock.

299
00:23:42.338 --> 00:23:46.206
Anytime. It's your home now.

300
00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:48.879
Oh, dear.

301
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.255
- Dude.
- Hey.

302
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.012
What is going on with you?
You bought rubbers?

303
00:23:58.103 --> 00:24:00.560
- How did you know that?
- It's on Russ Miller's blog.

304
00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:06.775
Jesus! That was, like, 11 minutes ago.

305
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:09.729
What's the deal? Dude.

306
00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:12.781
She wants me to meet her tonight
at the Big Boy in Knoxville.

307
00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:15.109
Seriously, dude, pack your shit.
We're going to Knoxville.

308
00:24:15.204 --> 00:24:17.286
No. Stop it. Put these back.

309
00:24:17.373 --> 00:24:19.113
This is the type of girl who has...

310
00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:21.870
She has it shaved into a landing strip.

311
00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:23.617
I can't deal with a landing strip.

312
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:26.374
Okay, dude, you don't know that. I mean,
she could have anything under there.

313
00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:31.050
There could be a little Hitler
or just a full, nasty Chewbacca.

314
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:34.970
You know, she doesn't even want me.
Okay. She wants him.

315
00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:39.926
I'm sorry. This is good. This is fine.

316
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.102
I mean, that looks like you. Like the eyes.

317
00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:44.889
Tasty's probably a guy, anyway.

318
00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:47.691
Maybe. But what if she's not?

319
00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:51.437
You know, I mean, look, you've already
opened, and I could help you close.

320
00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:53.564
We just need one thing.

321
00:24:59.081 --> 00:25:03.700
Ian, just look at this.
I mean, you roll up in a '69 GTO,

322
00:25:03.794 --> 00:25:06.410
she's gonna drop an egg right there
in the Big Boy parking lot.

323
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.461
Hey, Ian, come give me a hand with this.

324
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.633
Here. Strap that end down. Tight.

325
00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:16.425
- The cord's too short.
- Put a little sack into it, powder puff.

326
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.764
- All right. Thanks, little brother.
- Yeah.

327
00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:24.478
- Hey, Ian.
- Yeah.

328
00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:27.356
Did I hear something
about you wanting to borrow my car?

329
00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:29.934
No, no, it's fine. Thanks. Thank you.

330
00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:32.440
You sure?

331
00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:36.865
You're my little brother, Ian.
All you got to do is ask.

332
00:25:39.288 --> 00:25:40.403
Okay.

333
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.031
Could I use The Judge this weekend?

334
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.745
Ow!

335
00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:52.957
Fuck-stick, I wouldn't let you drive
The Judge if it was parked on my shnuts.

336
00:25:57.222 --> 00:25:59.429
- Let's go, Dad.
- What a dick.

337
00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:01.347
You should take his car just on principle.

338
00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:03.680
What do you want me to do, you know?

339
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:06.387
I mean, I doubt I can hot-wire it,
since I don't even know what that means.

340
00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:07.938
What are you doing?

341
00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:14.771
No. Lance, no! Put it back.
Did you just hear him? Please.

342
00:26:14.865 --> 00:26:17.026
Come here, we're gonna have a talk.

343
00:26:17.367 --> 00:26:19.028
She's only nine short hours away.

344
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:21.485
We're gonna head down there tonight
and you're gonna pound on that va-J.

345
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.287
Who's gonna pound on it? Say it.
Ian's gonna pound on it.

346
00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:27.036
We're back tomorrow
before Rex even knows the car is gone.

347
00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:29.709
Now, listen, these girls at Madison are
gonna be fucking at a college level.

348
00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:32.579
I need you ready for that.

349
00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:34.665
Wait! Put it... Put it back.

350
00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:36.549
Back here.

351
00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:54.356
For God's sake. You two rump rangers
couldn't wait five minutes?

352
00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:06.989
Shit.

353
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.095
- Shit!
- Fuck!

354
00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:27.722
I told her she could
stay here this weekend.

355
00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:31.601
What the hell?
Why are you driving Rex's car?

356
00:27:31.817 --> 00:27:33.273
I thought me and...

357
00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:37.978
- Are you bitching out on me?
- No.

358
00:27:38.073 --> 00:27:39.279
- No!
- No.

359
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:42.073
Good. Well, then where are we going?

360
00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:45.244
Um... Knoxville, Tennessee.

361
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.200
Okay. I'm gonna go tell my mom.

362
00:27:48.292 --> 00:27:52.126
Okay. Are you gonna... Awesome.

363
00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:53.827
Dude, what the fuck?

364
00:27:53.922 --> 00:27:55.708
- I don't want her along.
- Really?

365
00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:57.960
You don't want to bring Yoko
on your sex trip?

366
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.337
Yeah, no shit.
She's always cock-blocking you.

367
00:28:00.429 --> 00:28:03.011
No, she isn't. She doesn't even have a...

368
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:05.259
Okay, twat blocking.

369
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.430
Professor.

370
00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.507
When will you
be coming back?

371
00:28:07.603 --> 00:28:08.934
No, tomorrow.

372
00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:12.058
- When?
- No. Bye! God.

373
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:14.481
You guys
drive safe now. Bye!

374
00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:16.774
So, what's in Tennessee?

375
00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:20.188
My grandma has got some cancer.

376
00:28:20.258 --> 00:28:20.891
Wow!

377
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:22.822
- Grammy K?
- She's fine.

378
00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:26.201
She's gonna live forever.
Well, a long time.

379
00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:29.287
It's, you know...
I mean, what is it called?

380
00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:31.410
- It's foot cancer.
- She's got a little foot cancer.

381
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:33.708
She'll be hopping around in no time.

382
00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:36.628
So what's she doing in Tennessee?

383
00:28:37.216 --> 00:28:41.300
Oh! Um... Well, there's this kick-ass
cancer center there.

384
00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:45.174
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's like... It's famous.

385
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.639
- Yeah.
- So if you ever get any cancer,

386
00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:52.352
you should totally check it out.

387
00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:54.889
I would.

388
00:28:57.903 --> 00:29:02.192
So you want I-80 East and then
65 goes all the way through Indiana.

389
00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:05.148
- So how's it feel?
- What?

390
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:09.657
I don't know, breaking the rules,
talking some shit, driving The Judge?

391
00:29:10.874 --> 00:29:12.080
It feels pretty good.

392
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:51.194
This dude wants to race.

393
00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.247
Let's go, ladies.

394
00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:56.996
Lance! Cut it out!
Come on, you don't know who's in there.

395
00:29:57.087 --> 00:30:01.205
Dude, I don't care if fucking Steve
McQueen's zombie corpse is in that car.

396
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.292
I refuse to be embarrassed by a car
that looks like a Trapper Keeper.

397
00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:06.502
I am not racing in my brother's car.

398
00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:09.550
Holy Shit.

399
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.261
What the hell is that?

400
00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:13.717
Whoa!

401
00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:16.557
Looks like a Nachos BellGrande.

402
00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:18.104
And a chalupa!

403
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.765
Medium Coke!

404
00:30:21.153 --> 00:30:22.188
Go right!

405
00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:24.444
- Turn the wipers on!
- They are on.

406
00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.146
They're not working!

407
00:30:26.366 --> 00:30:29.199
Please, don't yell at me.
I'm doing the best I can.

408
00:30:30.162 --> 00:30:31.572
- Winnebago!
- Where?

409
00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:32.743
Winnebago! Winnebago!

410
00:30:41.048 --> 00:30:42.333
Oh, my God, are you all right?

411
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:51.133
Yeah, nobody offer to help.
I got this under control.

412
00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:03.021
- Are you all right?
- Do I look like I'm all right? Fuck!

413
00:31:05.322 --> 00:31:10.191
You know what might make you feel better?
Putting 40 on pump two.

414
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.289
Hey.

415
00:31:30.347 --> 00:31:34.340
- Another one for the collection.
- Aw! Cool. Thanks.

416
00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:38.184
What?

417
00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:46.901
It's okay, Brandy.
It's okay, baby, don't cry.

418
00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:48.649
Lance, what are you doing?

419
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.651
Dude, you should be ashamed of yourself,

420
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:54.655
because I'm just trying to show
another human being a little compassion.

421
00:31:55.288 --> 00:31:56.653
And my dick.

422
00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:05.583
What have you got?

423
00:32:05.966 --> 00:32:08.378
Hey, kid, where you from?

424
00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:14.589
- I'm from Chicago, I mean, outside Chicago.
- Are you two married. No?

425
00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:21.853
- No, we're just friends. We're amigos.
- Oh! You make a good couple.

426
00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:25.774
She's pretty. Marry that girl.

427
00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:28.694
You kids want to help yourself
to a can of Purple?

428
00:32:29.489 --> 00:32:33.448
- Purple sounds great, Ian. Purple?
- Yeah, I can go...

429
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:39.534
- You ever had a peppermint fatty?
- No. Let's have that.

430
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.865
See how that shoe fits.

431
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.371
That is curiously strong.

432
00:32:48.717 --> 00:32:51.299
I feel like my dick just got bar mitzvahed.

433
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.843
It actually says Purple Soda.

434
00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:00.641
Bad boy.

435
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:07.064
You like him, don't you?

436
00:33:10.489 --> 00:33:14.858
- What? Who?
- Lance. I mean, he's the crush, right?

437
00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:19.783
Oh, yeah! I like Lance, 'cause he's so hot.

438
00:33:19.873 --> 00:33:23.741
I wanna have his baby, he's... Whatever.

439
00:33:27.506 --> 00:33:30.464
- Brandy!
- Uh-oh!

440
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.587
Brandy! Shit.

441
00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:38.467
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

442
00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:43.427
Mr. McBroom. Ma'am.
Where the fuck's Brandy at?

443
00:33:52.489 --> 00:33:58.109
- You ever hear of a rolling brown-out?
- No. Let's try it.

444
00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:05.286
Wait, brown? No, no, nothing brown!
Nothing brown! Nothing brown!

445
00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:07.789
What're you gonna do? Hit a girl?

446
00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:12.210
No, but I'm gonna
pummel his ass real good.

447
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.632
There you go. There you go.

448
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:18.803
Brandy! Come on, baby!
Open the God damn door!

449
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.564
All right, this is not what it looks like.
It was a project for school.

450
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:30.766
Purple Soda!

451
00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:41.201
Wiener!

452
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.080
Ow!

453
00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.710
There you are.

454
00:35:00.974 --> 00:35:03.886
Come on, come on.
I do not want to die naked.

455
00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:14.518
Fuck you! Motherfucking son of a bitch!

456
00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:26.079
Get on your feet, you motherfucking pussy!

457
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.916
Hey, hold on!

458
00:35:31.588 --> 00:35:32.794
Come on, man, she's not worth it.

459
00:35:32.881 --> 00:35:35.588
She's just gonna shit all over you.
Trust me.

460
00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:38.132
Eat bat, dickhead!

461
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:41.177
Holy shit!

462
00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:44.426
Ian just killed that guy.

463
00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:46.633
Sir? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

464
00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:50.016
Look, I have my insurance card.
I'm sorry. We're from out of town.

465
00:35:50.106 --> 00:35:53.598
I couldn't see you through the corn.
I'm sorry.

466
00:35:57.197 --> 00:35:59.404
- Where the hell's the road?
- It feels like left.

467
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:00.651
I told you we didn't
have time for this,

468
00:36:00.742 --> 00:36:02.983
- but all you care about is your stupid dick.
- Ian.

469
00:36:03.078 --> 00:36:04.693
And you leave us out there
with her mom's weird soda.

470
00:36:04.788 --> 00:36:07.154
- Ian.
- And her dad's balls in plain view...

471
00:36:07.248 --> 00:36:08.363
Ian, Ian, whip a shitty!

472
00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:09.914
Motherfucker!

473
00:36:20.595 --> 00:36:23.758
Holy fucking shit! That's how you do that!

474
00:36:23.932 --> 00:36:27.766
Oh, my God, Ian, amazing driving.
Lance, you suck!

475
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:30.305
- Where the hell are we?
- Where are the Google maps?

476
00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:32.809
- They're in my pants.
- Which are?

477
00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:35.311
In the trailer.

478
00:36:36.986 --> 00:36:39.272
Mmm-hmm. Great.

479
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:44.107
Shit. I got gum in my bush.

480
00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:50.322
Hey, pick this guy up. Maybe he can
show us back to the highway.

481
00:36:50.417 --> 00:36:53.033
- Ian, do not pick up a hitchhiker.
- Don't worry, I won't.

482
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.416
No, no, no.

483
00:36:58.675 --> 00:37:00.586
Oh, my God.

484
00:37:02.804 --> 00:37:06.797
Hey! Thanks for the lift, man.
I've been out there for hours.

485
00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:08.928
Not one car. Can you believe it?

486
00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:11.634
- Listen, sir, we didn't...
- You're good people.

487
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:15.439
- Guy, you're not wearing any pants.
- Yeah, I know.

488
00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:16.890
Right on.

489
00:37:24.159 --> 00:37:28.744
I got nothing. There's no bars.
You know, it probably just needs water.

490
00:37:29.038 --> 00:37:30.574
Got any in the trunk?

491
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.372
Hey, sweetheart, men are talking.
We got this one.

492
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.418
Yeah, thanks,
but this happened to my brother's car once

493
00:37:36.504 --> 00:37:39.291
- and you just piss in the radiator.
- Really?

494
00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:41.122
Yeah.

495
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.421
Oh, God! Damn it!

496
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:47.758
- Are you okay?
- Fuck. Yeah.

497
00:37:47.849 --> 00:37:49.555
That's a lesson learned.

498
00:37:52.187 --> 00:37:54.052
You can watch,
if you're into that kind of thing.

499
00:37:54.147 --> 00:37:57.560
Oh, wow, thanks, but I think we've all seen
your dick enough for one day.

500
00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:02.440
- Do you hear that? There's a ringing.
- Your loss. It's like razor blades.

501
00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:07.320
What? There's ants down here. FYI.

502
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:12.200
All right, you're up. Grip it and rip it.

503
00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:16.204
Okay. Go away.

504
00:38:16.586 --> 00:38:20.750
Dude, seriously? Still?
I thought you got over this shit.

505
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.756
You're a grown man.

506
00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:34.634
Flowing river, gentle stream.
Flowing river, gentle stream.

507
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:38.187
- Yo, stage fright, how're we doing?
- Damn it, Lance, just give me a minute.

508
00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:45.062
Excuse me.
We kind of need you to pee in the radiator.

509
00:38:45.615 --> 00:38:48.732
- Why?
- We just do.

510
00:38:51.246 --> 00:38:54.238
Our new friend's got nothing left
in the tank.

511
00:38:58.753 --> 00:38:59.868
What?

512
00:39:05.635 --> 00:39:07.591
You kids need some help?

513
00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:15.512
Hi.

514
00:39:21.818 --> 00:39:22.898
Are you okay?

515
00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:26.478
Oh, yeah, I'm great.
I just beaved a family of four.

516
00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:28.821
Try it.

517
00:39:33.955 --> 00:39:35.115
All set?

518
00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:38.039
Look, I'm sorry, sir,
but we can't give you a ride.

519
00:39:40.128 --> 00:39:42.210
I'm gonna say this once.

520
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:46.290
You unlock this fucking car,
or God is my witness,

521
00:39:46.843 --> 00:39:49.004
I'll stake you all to the ground,

522
00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:52.337
cut you open and let the dogs get at you.

523
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:54.839
Oh, yeah?

524
00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.852
Bye-bye.

525
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.317
- Here's that pee you ordered.
- Roll them up.

526
00:40:15.622 --> 00:40:19.535
- There you go, Tex.
- You're soaked with pee.

527
00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:21.162
Quick car wash?

528
00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:23.664
- God!
- Gross.

529
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:27.339
It smells like Halloween. Fuck.

530
00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:30.504
How can nobody go down a road
for an hour and a half?

531
00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:32.426
Why did they even make this stupid road?

532
00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:34.504
It's so hot out here.

533
00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:36.180
Ow!

534
00:40:39.354 --> 00:40:44.018
Oh, my God, your head.
Wait... Does it hurt? Let me see.

535
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.186
Yes. It hurts.

536
00:40:48.488 --> 00:40:51.901
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

537
00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:56.484
Wow.

538
00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:11.670
That is so beautiful.

539
00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:21.683
Need some help?

540
00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:28.141
- Yeah, but no offense...
- Oh, right, 'cause I'm Amish,

541
00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:31.228
so I wouldn't know anything
about your '69 GTO Judge.

542
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:35.274
455 Big Block, Ram Air. 4-11 posi,
something like that.

543
00:41:35.368 --> 00:41:38.360
Weird, that thing must have fallen
straight from space.

544
00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:41.161
Well, good luck with the future ride,
spaceman.

545
00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:45.992
Hey, dude, wait up. Hold on.

546
00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:47.536
Wow!

547
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.665
Okay.

548
00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:53.045
What are you doing? Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Leesh, that's a bad idea.

549
00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:54.334
- What?
- Come on.

550
00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:56.966
You don't know how far we have to walk.
Those are your only pair of shoes.

551
00:41:57.056 --> 00:42:00.298
You know what? You're probably right.
God, you're so sensible.

552
00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:03.138
But maybe I should? Or maybe I shouldn't?

553
00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:04.514
I should.

554
00:42:07.233 --> 00:42:08.689
I can't believe you just did that.

555
00:42:08.776 --> 00:42:12.018
- All right. Now you.
- No way. Forget it.

556
00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:14.604
Dude, you never do anything crazy. Ever.

557
00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:17.816
Hey! I'm driving halfway across the country
to go to...

558
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.448
To visit your grandma? Whoa!

559
00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:24.622
So he met this chick on the Internet,
which is sketchy.

560
00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:25.949
The Internet?

561
00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:30.870
Yeah, it's like a series of computers
that are connected through...

562
00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:32.296
Computers?

563
00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:37.632
A computer's like a big calculator,
you know, with a screen.

564
00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:40.130
I'm just busting your balls, man.
I know what the Internet is.

565
00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:45.138
- Okay.
- You ever heard of Rumspringa?

566
00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:47.561
Yeah, that ska band from Delaware.

567
00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:51.891
No, it means "run wild." It's an Amish
tradition where when we turn 16,

568
00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:54.477
we can go live like you heathens
for a while.

569
00:42:54.572 --> 00:42:59.737
You go nuts, party for months or years
till your folks start hassling you,

570
00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:02.159
and then it's back to the Stone Age.

571
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.286
But if you're on Rumspringa,
what's with the buggy?

572
00:43:04.373 --> 00:43:06.580
Oh, no, I'm not. Not anymore.

573
00:43:07.543 --> 00:43:10.080
I probably shouldn't even be
talking to you, but...

574
00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:12.833
I'm a little bit of an Amish floutlaw.

575
00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:16.499
- Sometimes I just miss the world.
- What do you miss the most?

576
00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:19.586
You know, I miss sarcasm.
It's mostly lost on my people.

577
00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.715
Oh.

578
00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:26.973
And gambling. Went to Vegas once.
And butt fucking.

579
00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:31.890
- Got a lot of nice memories there.
- I hear that.

580
00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:34.146
You know, when you cut your foot on
a piece of glass,

581
00:43:34.237 --> 00:43:36.649
- don't think I'm gonna carry you.
- You know what? I will be fine. Okay?

582
00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:41.608
- I was born barefoot.
- Hey! Wait!

583
00:43:41.702 --> 00:43:44.785
Hey! Stop!

584
00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:50.492
Have a nice walk, shit-birds.

585
00:43:53.548 --> 00:43:55.163
- Oh!
- Oh!

586
00:43:58.563 --> 00:44:01.105
Hey! Ian, Felicia.
This is my boy Ezekiel.

587
00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:03.011
What up, English?

588
00:44:11.941 --> 00:44:13.772
There's no service out here.

589
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:17.147
- I can't even tell her I'll be late.
- Good. That's perfect. Keep her waiting.

590
00:44:17.238 --> 00:44:18.273
You don't want to come off as desperate.

591
00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:22.406
I'm driving nine hours.
How am I not coming off desperate?

592
00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:26.532
- We had shit to do.
- Uh-oh! See that creamy stuff?

593
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:29.948
You blew your head gasket.
That's not good.

594
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:32.533
- Shit.
- Don't cry. We can fix it.

595
00:44:32.628 --> 00:44:34.744
- Really?
- Yeah, really. We're good at it.

596
00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.329
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I didn't mean to undersell it,

597
00:44:36.424 --> 00:44:37.539
but it's an impressive thing.

598
00:44:37.633 --> 00:44:39.464
- Yeah. We'll fix it.
- Wow, that'd be cool.

599
00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:43.761
Yeah, would be cool, wouldn't it?
I might be the coolest guy you ever met.

600
00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:45.088
- Wow.
- Wow.

601
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.681
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

602
00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:50.350
That's what you say
when people do nice things for you.

603
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:52.474
You know, there's a pretty big shindig
shaping up next door

604
00:44:52.565 --> 00:44:55.557
if you guys want to hang there
while we work on it.

605
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:58.142
Take it easy while we do all this for you.

606
00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:04.607
- Does he have an attitude?
- No, he's fucking with you.

607
00:45:05.494 --> 00:45:06.483
Okay.

608
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:11.873
Just relax, man.
I got a good feeling about this, you know.

609
00:45:11.959 --> 00:45:13.369
You're gonna party with the Amish.

610
00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:16.498
Yeah, I'm sure it's gonna be
one kick-ass quilting bee.

611
00:45:19.467 --> 00:45:20.957
What's up, man?

612
00:45:21.052 --> 00:45:26.137
- Hey.
- No f-ing way!

613
00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:36.396
- This is insane!
- I know.

614
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:15.766
Thank you, guys, very, very, very, very much.
You guys fucking rule, man.

615
00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.323
Dude. Don't even bother.
Your game is not gonna work on that girl.

616
00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:39.744
What do you know about girls?
I've never even seen you with a girl.

617
00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:42.713
I'm gonna go check on the car.

618
00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:50.634
Yeah, fuck it. Let's dance.

619
00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:55.518
- Bite me. I'm not your consolation prize.
- Come on. Don't be hating.

620
00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:01.682
Fine.

621
00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:17.490
I've never shot a flaming
arrow that far, but I was game to try.

622
00:47:17.585 --> 00:47:18.950
And the thing is,
the second you let it release...

623
00:47:19.045 --> 00:47:24.711
Whoa! Hey, what is this?
Why are the seats out?

624
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.132
Ian, do you know anything
about fixing these old Pontiacs?

625
00:47:27.219 --> 00:47:31.303
I don't care, okay?
Ezekiel, take all the pieces and just

626
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:34.427
- put them back in there. I don't want...
- Ian, you've got to calm down.

627
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:35.849
Do you know any breathing exercises?

628
00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:38.052
Because you are right on the verge
of a freak-out.

629
00:47:38.147 --> 00:47:42.937
You don't know my brother, okay? He's
gonna fuck my ass with a roll of quarters.

630
00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:46.645
What? He's gonna what? With what?

631
00:47:46.739 --> 00:47:51.483
Oh, yeah! He's gonna go get off work early,
and he's gonna walk into the bank,

632
00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:53.659
stand in line, change a 10,

633
00:47:53.788 --> 00:47:57.622
find my ass and just fuck it
with a roll of fucking quarters.

634
00:48:37.373 --> 00:48:41.707
Check it out. It's totally working.

635
00:48:41.794 --> 00:48:44.001
You're the best wing-man ever.

636
00:48:44.088 --> 00:48:46.625
She's in, she's in. Watch this.

637
00:48:56.767 --> 00:49:00.259
Rumspringa! Whoo!

638
00:49:01.897 --> 00:49:04.479
- I took a wicked digger.
- Yes, you did.

639
00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:08.276
- First day of Rumspringa?
- Rumspringa!

640
00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:12.859
- Uh-oh!
- Oh!

641
00:49:15.578 --> 00:49:16.693
Hey.

642
00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:24.459
- All right. Okay. You good? All right.
- Aw! You guys are so nice.

643
00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:26.536
Don't let her step in it.

644
00:49:29.717 --> 00:49:32.834
What? What's wrong with you?

645
00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:36.841
- Yeah, what's your problem, bitch?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

646
00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:40.216
Nothing. She's fine. God, lay off.

647
00:49:40.311 --> 00:49:41.721
- It's Lance, right?
- No.

648
00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:44.144
I'll bet he's in there with that Amish girl
and you're out here.

649
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:45.266
Wrong.

650
00:49:45.357 --> 00:49:48.190
Come on, Leesh, just drop
the hard-ass thing for two minutes.

651
00:49:48.277 --> 00:49:51.895
You know. It's okay. You're into Lance.

652
00:49:54.408 --> 00:49:57.775
- God, I'm such an idiot.
- Look, there's something about Lance.

653
00:49:58.913 --> 00:50:03.156
Everybody likes Lance. I like Lance.

654
00:50:04.919 --> 00:50:07.831
Just promise me
you won't ever be like Lance.

655
00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:14.338
What is wrong with us?
Let's go have some fun. Come on.

656
00:50:14.887 --> 00:50:16.923
- No. No.
- No?

657
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:22.346
Come on, we're young, and we're Amish,
and it's Rumspringa.

658
00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:23.801
Rumspringa!

659
00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:54.002
Ian, you little cock-sucker!

660
00:51:13.862 --> 00:51:14.897
Ah!

661
00:51:14.989 --> 00:51:17.651
Leesh, you're so stubborn.
Look at your feet.

662
00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:20.027
They are fine. All right?

663
00:51:21.537 --> 00:51:23.823
Hey. What's the plan?

664
00:51:25.165 --> 00:51:28.032
I might as well find a phone and call Rex

665
00:51:28.836 --> 00:51:32.829
- so he can get on with killing me.
- What about visiting your grandma?

666
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:36.548
Yeah, dude. You been putting off
visiting your grandma for too long.

667
00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:39.877
- It's about time you visited Grandma.
- Yeah.

668
00:51:39.972 --> 00:51:45.183
Lance, you know, I really do
want to visit my grandma, but...

669
00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:50.138
Dude, I really can't stress enough how
much you're gonna enjoy visiting Grandma.

670
00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:54.062
You know, I visit my grandma sometimes
two or three times a week,

671
00:51:54.236 --> 00:51:57.444
and it is always a pleasure.
She's just a delight.

672
00:51:57.531 --> 00:51:58.520
What am I supposed to do?

673
00:51:58.616 --> 00:52:00.902
Our transportation is all over the floor
of that barn.

674
00:52:00.993 --> 00:52:02.324
Hey, Mary!

675
00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:05.694
Hi.

676
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:12.748
Wow, you look beautiful.

677
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:14.453
Oh, please.

678
00:52:14.548 --> 00:52:19.759
I mean, seriously, you wearing that,
churning some butter. Sexy.

679
00:52:19.845 --> 00:52:22.552
So I had the best time with you last night.

680
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.050
Yeah, me, too.

681
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:27.008
So you got my number.
You're gonna call me, right?

682
00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:29.347
No.

683
00:52:30.564 --> 00:52:33.271
"No." You're funny.

684
00:52:34.026 --> 00:52:39.737
I mean, Lance, I really like you,
but Rumspringa's over for me.

685
00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:42.314
- So...
- Rumspringa!

686
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:50.281
Sorry.

687
00:53:16.235 --> 00:53:17.395
You fixed it?

688
00:53:17.486 --> 00:53:20.978
Yeah, we hit a few snags,
but she's banging like a champ now.

689
00:53:21.073 --> 00:53:23.906
Man, I don't even...
I don't even know what to say here.

690
00:53:23.992 --> 00:53:26.358
You know, I don't really have much...

691
00:53:26.453 --> 00:53:28.239
Oh, no, we're good. We're good.

692
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:31.367
I mean, the opportunity to help a neighbor,
that's a gift.

693
00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:35.660
Man, you're too... Here, thanks.
Thank you so much.

694
00:53:35.754 --> 00:53:37.369
- You're welcome.
- Thank you, it's really cool.

695
00:53:37.464 --> 00:53:39.420
It is. You know, I mean,

696
00:53:39.508 --> 00:53:42.841
if you felt the need to reciprocate
in some way,

697
00:53:42.928 --> 00:53:45.294
I mean, there's a lot of chores
that need to be done around here.

698
00:53:45.389 --> 00:53:49.473
Yeah, no, the only thing about that is
we're kind of behind schedule right now.

699
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.551
Yeah, but, I mean,
we could totally come back.

700
00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:53.931
- We could hit you on our way back through.
- Okay.

701
00:53:54.022 --> 00:53:56.638
Yeah, you should.
You should really get on the road.

702
00:53:56.734 --> 00:54:01.569
I mean, you got a smooth-running
vehicle now, you know, 'cause we fixed it.

703
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:06.490
- Yeah. No, but it's... So we're good?
- We're good. Yeah, technically.

704
00:54:07.286 --> 00:54:08.571
We'll come back. I promise.

705
00:54:08.662 --> 00:54:11.950
- I'm looking forward to that.
- Hey, no, seriously, we will.

706
00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.452
Okay. We'll all hold our breath
till you get back.

707
00:54:14.543 --> 00:54:17.660
On three, guys. Three, two...

708
00:54:27.347 --> 00:54:30.464
My stomach's killing me.
Tell me if you see a rest stop.

709
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:53.328
Fuck. I know you didn't take my car, Ian.

710
00:54:53.415 --> 00:54:55.406
'Cause you're a big, giant pussy.
That's right.

711
00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:57.492
That's why. It's here, isn't it?

712
00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:15.176
Want some of this?

713
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:22.140
Shit!

714
00:55:22.236 --> 00:55:25.899
Hey, Knievel, what say you get
your bike out of the fricking road?

715
00:55:44.049 --> 00:55:45.835
All ocupado, eh, sport?

716
00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.800
Gents.

717
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:57.642
Well, looks like we're up.
Go on, get in there.

718
00:56:06.488 --> 00:56:07.477
Oh!

719
00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:09.946
Am I getting a signal?

720
00:56:11.535 --> 00:56:14.777
Tasty, I got sidetracked last night.

721
00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:18.868
I had to party with some new homies.

722
00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:25.792
Tonight, 8:00 pm at Big Boy.

723
00:56:27.509 --> 00:56:29.295
I'm worth the wait.

724
00:56:34.182 --> 00:56:35.171
Yes!

725
00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:47.310
No! Oh, God! No, thank you! No, thank you!

726
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:54.279
Little buddy? Hello? Hello.

727
00:56:57.039 --> 00:57:00.702
- Was that you screaming in there?
- I don't want to talk about it. Ever.

728
00:57:00.792 --> 00:57:03.829
- Where's Felicia?
- She went to get corn dogs.

729
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:31.486
Can you believe
the girls around here, man?

730
00:57:31.573 --> 00:57:35.566
But, man, where am I ever gonna find
another girl as cool as Mary?

731
00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:39.990
You like it?

732
00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:47.290
- What about Felicia?
- What about her?

733
00:57:50.759 --> 00:57:54.468
- She's into you.
- Yeah, no shit. Get in line.

734
00:57:54.554 --> 00:57:57.296
What is that?
She's not good enough for you?

735
00:57:57.391 --> 00:57:59.302
Felicia's awesome,

736
00:57:59.393 --> 00:58:02.510
but the obvious statement to make here
is that you like her.

737
00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:07.815
- What? No, I...
- You're shocked. You can't believe it.

738
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:12.315
- This bombshell. Come on.
- You know, she's not into me anyways.

739
00:58:12.406 --> 00:58:16.445
Yeah, I know. But it doesn't matter.
I still... I could never do that to you.

740
00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:21.662
Okay, but you do know
that she's not into you, right?

741
00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:26.162
- Yeah. Well, maybe you don't know.
- No. No, no, I'm gonna stop you.

742
00:58:26.253 --> 00:58:30.747
There's no maybe. Okay?
And I'm saying this as your best friend,

743
00:58:30.841 --> 00:58:36.427
but never. Never fucking ever. You know?

744
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:37.753
Because you guys are friends.

745
00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:41.591
You know what every girl
I've ever banged had in common?

746
00:58:42.728 --> 00:58:45.140
I wasn't friends with any of them.

747
00:58:47.274 --> 00:58:50.732
And they all had gorgeous teeth.
I'm into that.

748
00:58:50.819 --> 00:58:54.277
Real simple.
Climb the rope, hit the bell, win a prize.

749
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:57.902
Hey, there, Bilbo Baggins,
there's no height requirement.

750
00:58:57.993 --> 00:59:00.609
Why don't you step up
and win your girlfriend a prize?

751
00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:04.037
Uh... We're not... She's not my girlfriend.

752
00:59:04.124 --> 00:59:07.241
- What about your other girlfriend there?
- Nice.

753
00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:26.681
All right, come on, Ian. You can do it.

754
00:59:26.772 --> 00:59:29.935
Come on, you're almost there!
You're almost there! Go, go, go!

755
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:31.936
Winner! Winner! Winner!

756
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.686
- That was awesome.
- How the hell did you do that?

757
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:37.942
We had one of these at Cub Scout camp.
I kind of mastered it.

758
00:59:38.033 --> 00:59:40.069
Yeah, you think you're hot shit?

759
00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.032
- Lolly?
- Thank you.

760
00:59:48.794 --> 00:59:50.500
Hey, hey, hey, ass.

761
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:56.040
Hey. What's your secret?

762
00:59:56.134 --> 00:59:58.921
You just...
If you keep your shoulders down...

763
00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:01.674
- No coaching.
- What?

764
01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.465
No coaching there, Lombardi.
Read the sign.

765
01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:06.634
No coaching.

766
01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:11.096
Cheese and rice!

767
01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:12.646
Oh.

768
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:17.402
- Thanks. I'm Sandy.
- I'm Ian.

769
01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.229
- Hi.
- Hey.

770
01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:27.412
- Consolation prize?
- Wow! Thank you so much.

771
01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:30.161
You know, my dance team's performing
over at the tent in a couple of minutes.

772
01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:31.617
You guys should come watch.

773
01:00:31.711 --> 01:00:34.498
- Actually, we were just about to go.
- That sounds super fun. He'll be there.

774
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:36.250
Great. See you.

775
01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:39.716
Dude, that girl reeks of sex.

776
01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.013
- Do we really have time for...
- Hey, hey.

777
01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.769
You have to stop doing that to him.

778
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.771
- Doing what?
- Twat blocking.

779
01:00:56.862 --> 01:01:00.025
I'm not twat... Doing that.

780
01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:13.204
Yeah! Let's give it up for the AX Dancers!

781
01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:17.629
Come on, girls,
let's help me get some fellas up in here.

782
01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.749
- Ian.
- Oh, no. Please.

783
01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.880
Get up there. Come on.

784
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.256
Come on!

785
01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.838
In the back! In the back!

786
01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:29.258
Yeah!

787
01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:37.482
Come on, two more, two more! Yeah!

788
01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:42.150
Dude, turn around.

789
01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:55.913
Look at this fine crop
of handsome fellas I got here.

790
01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.293
But before we get down to business,

791
01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.873
there's a young woman here

792
01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:04.960
who would like to share her story
with these young men.

793
01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:09.048
- Kristy, you ready, baby?
- Okay.

794
01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:16.138
So, last year I was at a dance
with my boyfriend.

795
01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.315
He wanted to go to his car.

796
01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.270
So I did.

797
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.315
So we were both naked in the back seat
and we started having oral...

798
01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:49.845
Excuse me!

799
01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:55.637
Excuse me!
Is this tragic story turning you on?

800
01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:10.863
This courageous young lady pours
her heart out and this is getting you hot?

801
01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.870
It's time for you to pledge. Right now!

802
01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:17.241
Boy, you need this more than anybody.

803
01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.789
Hey, keep a wrinkle in it, captain.

804
01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:26.717
I can't believe you took
a fucking abstinence pledge with a hard-on.

805
01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:27.966
It's classic.

806
01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:31.262
Look, I didn't even know what she was
talking about. That doesn't count! Okay?

807
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.180
- Ian! Hey!
- It gets better.

808
01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:35.179
I am so proud of you!

809
01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.268
Get away from me. Is that what you do?

810
01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:40.643
You go out and you lure little dorks like
me into your little no-having-sex club?

811
01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:42.725
Ian, it's not like that at all.

812
01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.481
Just go away. Now.

813
01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:52.238
- I would've blown you, you know.
- Really?

814
01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:53.409
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

815
01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:56.579
You can keep your stupid
flipping lollipop, anyway!

816
01:03:59.294 --> 01:04:01.535
- You are dead, psycho-virgin!
- No, no!

817
01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:03.585
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

818
01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:10.593
Hey, are you sure you want to get
dental work done in Floater, Kentucky?

819
01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.514
Dr. Teddescoe will be
with you present-like.

820
01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.091
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

821
01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:32.362
Fine, okay, you were right.
My feet are killing me,

822
01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:35.068
and I never should've tossed my shoes.

823
01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:39.285
No, come on.
I love that your shoes are in that tree.

824
01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:44.961
I do. That's premium Felicia.

825
01:04:46.403 --> 01:04:48.493
Felicia Alpine.

826
01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:49.582
Oh.

827
01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:54.637
- So what'd you do to her?
- Hmm?

828
01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:55.930
Smack her around a little bit?

829
01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:58.132
She gets out of line, you pop her one?

830
01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:01.891
- No. No, sir, I...
- I got you. I'm just teasing you, man.

831
01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.562
We have fun.

832
01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:07.188
- He didn't, though, did he?
- Hmm? Mmm-mmm.

833
01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.187
Be back in a couple minutes.
I'm gonna wait for that to numb up.

834
01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:11.521
Mmm-hmm.

835
01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:13.652
Hands to yourself, O.J.

836
01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:19.701
Ian, you know the other night
at Lance's party?

837
01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.497
- Was I there?
- No, come on.

838
01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:28.871
Here.

839
01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:38.306
I mean, you know the only reason is because
I don't want to ruin our friendship.

840
01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:43.728
Totally, I mean friendship is awesome.
Good call.

841
01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:49.142
I don't know what I'd
do if I ever lost you.

842
01:05:56.744 --> 01:06:01.363
- You won't.
- What are you thinking about?

843
01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.876
- What are you thinking about?
- I asked you first.

844
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.290
You got a little loogie.

845
01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.462
I'm gonna go see if Lance...

846
01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:18.592
Mmm-hmm.

847
01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:20.219
Go. Go.

848
01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:35.985
Um, I'll take these as well.

849
01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:44.785
They're not for me. They're not.

850
01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:56.255
- Heads up.
- What's with you?

851
01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.346
I'm thinking maybe we head back home.

852
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.173
What? Why?

853
01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:05.852
Well, Felicia and I were talking in there,

854
01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:09.648
- and we kind of had a moment.
- Oh! Oh, did you guys have a little moment?

855
01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.315
- Yeah.
- You're a moron.

856
01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:14.482
Fuck you. We've talked about this.

857
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.944
Look, we're almost there,
and I'm not letting her do this.

858
01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:21.113
We're going to Knoxville,
and you're getting your nut.

859
01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:23.870
No, I'm not. I'm not.

860
01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:26.744
No, I'm gonna text Tasty,
and I'm gonna tell her I'm not coming.

861
01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:30.122
- Ian, get in this car.
- I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.

862
01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:35.082
Shit, where's my phone?
Hey, you got a new smile.

863
01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:38.464
You have my phone. I didn't know...
This is for you.

864
01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:41.550
Mmm! A message came in.

865
01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:44.508
Your grandma says she's really excited
to see you.

866
01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.885
And something about her hot,
shaved pussy.

867
01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:48.311
Must be the cancer talking.

868
01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.393
All right. Good deal.
We're going to Knoxville.

869
01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.341
Ian, you're going the wrong way.

870
01:08:19.637 --> 01:08:21.593
- We're going home.
- What?

871
01:08:22.181 --> 01:08:25.139
Please, do not turn around
because of me. Okay.

872
01:08:25.226 --> 01:08:27.558
- Yeah, no shit.
- I'm dying to see Ms. Tasty.

873
01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:28.976
This is going to be hilarious.

874
01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:31.520
A hundred bucks says she has a wiener.

875
01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.475
Look, I said we're going home.
I don't want to talk about it.

876
01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.150
I knew you'd find some way
to fuck this up for him.

877
01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:39.604
Me? You two are fucking scheming
behind my back.

878
01:08:39.699 --> 01:08:42.065
- No, we're not.
- Okay. You stole Rex's car.

879
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.821
You drove halfway across the country.

880
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:46.903
This must be what you want to do.
So do it, chicken shit!

881
01:08:46.998 --> 01:08:49.364
- Fucking A, chicken shit.
- Fine! You know what?

882
01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:52.451
I'll turn the car around, I'll flip a bitch,
and I'll go pork somebody. Right now.

883
01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:53.955
I'll be that guy. Is that what you want?

884
01:08:54.047 --> 01:08:55.833
- Be that guy! That guy rules.
- Sounds awesome.

885
01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:59.541
- That would make me so happy.
- All right. All right. Fantastic! I'm doing it.

886
01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.631
- Watch out, Ian! Fuck!
- Watch it, Ian!

887
01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:05.839
Whoo!

888
01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.634
- You like that?
- Did your fucking balls just drop?

889
01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.219
Holy shit, Ian.

890
01:09:12.190 --> 01:09:18.902
- Oh, man, it's this douche again.
- You want it? You got it.

891
01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.903
- Hold on to your pantyhose.
- Okay, we got to work on your banter,

892
01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:24.198
but otherwise, this is awesome.

893
01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:29.950
- You're losing him.
- No, I got him. I got him.

894
01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:36.086
- Jesus, Ian! Not so close.
- God damn it!

895
01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:42.633
No way, man! You're dead.

896
01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.550
Sorry. He's all right.

897
01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:49.757
This guy's fucking dangerous!

898
01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:56.980
Where is he? Talk to me, dudes.

899
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.692
Right up our ass. He's in our ass.

900
01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:07.530
- He's tagging out.
- Ah! Ladies!

901
01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.609
Ian, look out!

902
01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.204
Oh! Oh!

903
01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:17.455
God damn it.

904
01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.958
What were you doing, man? Shit.

905
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.052
Dude, take it easy. This wasn't your fault.
He jumped right in front of you.

906
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.098
Just shut up, Lance.
Of course it's my fault.

907
01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:31.891
Now, come on, man,
this possum's not gonna fuck you.

908
01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:33.514
We got to go find Ms. Tasty.

909
01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:37.973
He's suffering, Lance. I'm not gonna
leave him here by himself. Okay?

910
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.977
Okay. You're right.

911
01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:47.403
We got to help him.
We got to call a vet or something.

912
01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:52.829
Ian, look at him.
There's not a lot that we can do.

913
01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.999
You guys'll probably want to back up.
This'll probably stink like shit.

914
01:10:57.086 --> 01:11:00.374
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm gonna take him out of his misery.

915
01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:03.832
They don't make little wheelchairs for him.
He's done, man.

916
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:07.298
Fuck you, Lance.
God, you don't even give a shit about him.

917
01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.421
I'll do it.

918
01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:20.940
I'm sorry.

919
01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.900
All possums go to heaven.

920
01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:34.329
Uh... Ian. It... I think it's still...

921
01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:36.492
Shit.

922
01:11:43.674 --> 01:11:45.585
Oh, no.

923
01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:49.586
Ian, I'm so sorry, it's...

924
01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:55.641
Oh, God! Jesus fucking... God damn it!
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

925
01:11:56.312 --> 01:12:01.022
- He's really hanging in there.
- God! Fuck!

926
01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:06.979
You guys ever listen to Sonic Youth? I've
been on a big Sonic Youth phase lately.

927
01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.569
You know, their bass player's a woman.

928
01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:23.911
We are in jail.

929
01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:36.178
Okay, listen, you have got to be cool,
'cause if they see you shitting yourself

930
01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:37.304
they're gonna fuck with us.

931
01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:39.386
Hey! Hey, ladies.

932
01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:43.268
Hey, how about you sit the fuck back down
before me and you have a problem?

933
01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:46.977
How about you just chill out, man?
Be cool.

934
01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:49.608
- All right. We good?
- Yeah, we're good.

935
01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:06.288
- Excuse me.
- Listen, old man, I'm only gonna tell you...

936
01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:10.250
You should've seen the look in his eyes.

937
01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:13.636
His heart was breaking
for this poor little thing.

938
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:18.554
Shit, that boy Ian don't seem
like he got no balls at all.

939
01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:22.307
Why? 'Cause he got to fussing some
over a suffering critter?

940
01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.938
I think that's real sweet.

941
01:13:25.038 --> 01:13:28.292
Hmm, well I say this Lance,
he sounds like a real hunk of man.

942
01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:30.819
But he got no respect for bitches.

943
01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:36.321
Shathayd's right. No respect for bitches.
None whatsoever.

944
01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.992
You love Ian, don't you, baby?

945
01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:47.670
Well, it's just we've been best friends
since we were really little,

946
01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:51.590
and I don't know, he's the only person
I can really talk to, you know?

947
01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:57.297
When I was a girl, my best friend was
a fella named Creighton McDaniel.

948
01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:03.853
We used to stay up all night just talking
and laughing and carrying on.

949
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:08.854
Then one day I got it into my head
that we ought to be more than friends.

950
01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.152
So I tell him I love him.

951
01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.188
What happened?

952
01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:19.448
We dated for a few weeks.

953
01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:22.572
Then he met a gal over in Wofford.

954
01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:26.375
We still talk from time to time.

955
01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:30.125
But it was never the same between us.

956
01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:43.597
Baby. Come here.
Come on, now. Come on, now.

957
01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.897
You know you need a hug.
Come on, honey.

958
01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:51.476
Cuddle up.

959
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:56.939
Dude.

960
01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:02.070
- What?
- Look, you're pissing in front of everybody.

961
01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:06.411
Yeah, I am.

962
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:09.790
- And that guy's looking right at your dick.
- Atta-boy.

963
01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:18.219
- Look at you. You're a new man.
- No, I'm not.

964
01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:23.808
Dude. You stole a car, you got arrested,
you got in a prison fight.

965
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.807
And now you're in here pissing
like a big dog.

966
01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:28.853
I mean, there's only one thing left.

967
01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:32.183
Yeah, well, that's out.
I was supposed to meet her two hours ago.

968
01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:35.520
Dude, when we get out of here,
just tell her you got pinched.

969
01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:38.447
She'll think that's bad-ass, because it is.

970
01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:42.694
Lafferty, Nesbitt,
your bail has been posted.

971
01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:43.823
Really?

972
01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:48.578
- Time to go.
- Shit!

973
01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:51.585
- What?
- Rex.

974
01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:53.419
Oh.

975
01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:59.385
All right, Duane, I'm gonna go to your
MySpace page and listen to your album.

976
01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:03.966
And I hope to see you soon
in better circumstances.

977
01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:16.018
- Hey.
- Mary!

978
01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:21.152
Wait. Wait. How did you find me?

979
01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:24.155
Well, I called your cell phone,
and then someone answered here.

980
01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:29.616
- That's awesome. Okay.
- Are you okay? Why are you in jail?

981
01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.212
I mean, there's a number of charges, but
the most prominent ones were animal cruelty

982
01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.415
and the assaulting the officer.

983
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.252
But it's not nearly as bad
as it sounds on paper, okay? I promise.

984
01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:43.383
- Okay.
- Okay. Wait right here. Okay.

985
01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:46.265
- Teddy, Carol.
- Lance, my man.

986
01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:49.059
- You guys got my stuff?
- It's gonna be a few minutes.

987
01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:51.228
All right. I got to put up with a lot here.

988
01:16:51.315 --> 01:16:53.271
I was raped last night.
I'm just fucking with you.

989
01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.193
Oh, man. But one guy did get raped.

990
01:17:54.837 --> 01:18:01.754
Ian, don't do this. No,
don't turn into Lance. You're a good guy.

991
01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:04.669
Yeah, well, that's why I'm still a virgin.

992
01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:09.507
So what if you're a virgin?
God, Ian, it's just sex. It's not...

993
01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:14.767
No, Felicia, it's not about the sex.
It's not. I'm weird.

994
01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:18.566
I'm the only virgin I know.
I need to get this done

995
01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.145
so everyone can just stop
freaking out about it.

996
01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:25.406
Look, I know you don't approve,
but I'm sorry, I just...

997
01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:27.357
I'm not going home a virgin.

998
01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.159
Then do it with me.

999
01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:32.446
What?

1000
01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.951
Do it with me and not some stranger.

1001
01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:41.414
We're friends so you know
you're not gonna get some, like,

1002
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:46.043
crabs or genital warts
or some pussing thing that's coming...

1003
01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.675
Wow, Leesh. That's hot!

1004
01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:53.722
You know what?

1005
01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:57.430
I think I'd rather stay a virgin forever
than lose it on pity-sex.

1006
01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:01.271
- I'm not talking about pity-sex.
- Then what are you talking about?

1007
01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:04.479
I don't know. Sex.

1008
01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:11.195
It doesn't have to mean anything. It
doesn't have to jeopardize our friendship.

1009
01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:12.611
Ah!

1010
01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:15.448
Leesh, you know what?
Fuck the friendship!

1011
01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.033
I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

1012
01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:21.916
I can't be the guy that you're gonna talk to
about your boyfriends anymore. I can't...

1013
01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:25.003
I can't be the guy who's gonna pick you up
in the middle of the night,

1014
01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:28.962
and you're gonna cry to because
Derrick Dicottes found some other girl.

1015
01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:34.676
And maybe I'm just being selfish here,
but it is not enough.

1016
01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:38.137
Okay, so I'm gonna go out that door,
and I'm gonna go have meaningless sex

1017
01:19:38.232 --> 01:19:43.192
with some random, hopefully hot, hopefully
female person that I met on the Internet.

1018
01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:48.148
Unless you've got something better
to say to me.

1019
01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.332
That's what I thought.

1020
01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.664
Check out time, dick-cheese.

1021
01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:43.961
- Rex, how'd you find me?
- You ever heard of LoJack, cheese-dick?

1022
01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.134
Come here.

1023
01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:03.351
Come on, Rex, wait. The girl...
The one I told you about from the Internet.

1024
01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:06.855
She's right across the street, Rex.
She wants to do it with me and everything.

1025
01:21:06.945 --> 01:21:08.651
Like I give a shit!

1026
01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:23.367
Get your shit, queer-bait!
We're going home.

1027
01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.123
Okay. Okay, fine.

1028
01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:27.378
Now!

1029
01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:29.377
It probably wouldn't have Changed

1030
01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:32.926
all these feelings
that I've been having lately anyway.

1031
01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:37.006
What are you talking about?

1032
01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:40.969
I don't know, Rex. You know, just feelings,

1033
01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:47.558
curiosity about men.

1034
01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.687
Oh, shit, Ian!

1035
01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:58.115
I think you might be right.
I think I might be getting gay.

1036
01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:02.824
Oh, God damn it. Oh, fuck!

1037
01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:07.416
But I just haven't had
any luck with girls, Rex.

1038
01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:11.465
No way! No way my little brother's
taking it in the chili ring.

1039
01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:21.346
All right, you take the car,

1040
01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:25.138
and you go bang a female woman
like the good Lord intended.

1041
01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:27.018
You've got one hour!

1042
01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.065
- Ian.
- Yeah?

1043
01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:35.106
- Not up the butt.
- Right.

1044
01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:02.721
Hey, man. You looking for somebody?

1045
01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:07.645
Ms. Tasty.

1046
01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.642
Ian?

1047
01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:19.316
Oh, my gosh! Hey.

1048
01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:22.407
I was sure you were standing me up.

1049
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:27.123
- But here you are. Look at you.
- See you.

1050
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.127
You look a little different
than your picture.

1051
01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:35.086
Yeah, I know. I lost a lot of weight
'cause I had the runs... The flu.

1052
01:23:36.762 --> 01:23:40.425
Well, you're mighty cute,
and your car is really pretty.

1053
01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:44.599
Why don't you take me for a ride?

1054
01:23:49.816 --> 01:23:53.274
So, Ms. Tasty, what's your real name?

1055
01:23:55.113 --> 01:24:00.949
- How about I tell you after?
- Yeah, sure.

1056
01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:05.203
Works for me.

1057
01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:28.181
- No, Mary, wait.
- What?

1058
01:24:28.272 --> 01:24:31.639
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I mean...

1059
01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:36.060
Nothing, I just... I really like you,

1060
01:24:39.157 --> 01:24:43.321
and I don't want to ruin this. You know?

1061
01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:49.039
But, hey, maybe you could come
to Chicago and we could hang out

1062
01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.249
- and take it a little...
- No.

1063
01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:54.828
Lance, it doesn't work like that.

1064
01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:02.048
And, I mean, if I don't go back,
I'm gonna be shunned.

1065
01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:05.847
I could never see my family again.

1066
01:25:07.394 --> 01:25:11.683
- This Amish thing is a real motherfucker.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

1067
01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:22.606
- Ian.
- Yeah.

1068
01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:25.408
I think we should take our clothes off.

1069
01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.449
Wow. Really? Right here?

1070
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.780
Mmm-hmm.

1071
01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:33.246
No one's around for miles. Come on.

1072
01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:35.161
Okay.

1073
01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:45.421
- What do you think?
- Ample.

1074
01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:47.051
Mmm-hmm.

1075
01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:51.677
I think we should take
your clothes off now.

1076
01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:54.980
Yeah, maybe we should.

1077
01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:59.561
- I don't play football!
- Okay.

1078
01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:02.313
I... I really don't.
I mean, I don't even really watch football.

1079
01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:04.523
I mean, I got all that stuff
from Friday Night Lights,

1080
01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:07.576
which is a show. It's also a movie
starring Billy Bob Thornton.

1081
01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:09.654
- I don't know if you saw it, but...
- Ian.

1082
01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:15.789
What? You think everything in my profile's
the God's honest truth? No.

1083
01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:18.746
Now, come on, take your Clothes off.

1084
01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:25.590
Look, there's this girl...

1085
01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:31.099
Ian, this can be our little secret.
No one has to know.

1086
01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:34.261
Now come here.

1087
01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:51.779
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I can't do this with you.

1088
01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:57.122
I'm kissing you,
and I'm thinking about somebody else.

1089
01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:02.209
No, and I know that's a stupid thing
to say. I mean, she's not even...

1090
01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.294
Oh, no, no, no. Ms. Tasty,
please don't cry.

1091
01:27:08.181 --> 01:27:11.969
It's not a reflection of...
You're so pretty, like...

1092
01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:14.350
You're laughing.

1093
01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:17.396
Just take your fucking clothes
off, asshole!

1094
01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:21.896
Look, I'm sorry, okay.
I don't mean to lead you on here,

1095
01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:26.230
and I'll give you a ride home,
but I don't think that... What the fuck?

1096
01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:28.440
You heard the lady. Strip.

1097
01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:34.704
- Do you have any jacks?
- Yup.

1098
01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:39.118
- I win.
- Oh! Again.

1099
01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:40.702
Yup.

1100
01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:47.834
- All right, just take your shirt off.
- Okay, good.

1101
01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:55.175
You were right, Ian. '69 Judge.
You were worth the wait.

1102
01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:03.191
- Please, no! Come on, it's not even my car!
- Oh, and good luck with the lady friend.

1103
01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:10.904
Felicia. Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1104
01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:15.863
Now, listen. I got another car coming
any minute now, okay?

1105
01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:17.618
- Got it.
- So take me back to the Big Boy

1106
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:20.121
- and get this goat over to Luis.
- Right.

1107
01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:27.216
And where is Luis?
5th and Crescent!

1108
01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:30.127
- I fucking told you.
- I know where it is.

1109
01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:33.839
Shit!

1110
01:28:45.779 --> 01:28:46.859
Hi.

1111
01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:56.366
- Hey, boys. You finally made it.
- What's up, Ms. Tasty?

1112
01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:58.993
What's up? What's up?

1113
01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:01.666
- Damn, you're hot as fuck.
- Yeah.

1114
01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:05.621
- We brought beers and rubbers.
- And some lotion for your tits.

1115
01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:25.562
I can't believe I'm banging an Amish chick.
I mean, seriously, what are the odds?

1116
01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:28.644
Oh, yeah! More of that.

1117
01:29:31.074 --> 01:29:35.659
So, wait, you do want to party?

1118
01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:37.611
With us?

1119
01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:40.789
Oh, yeah. I want us all
to get naked and party.

1120
01:29:53.506 --> 01:29:56.789
Fuck!
I can't fucking believe this.

1121
01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:03.687
Get your ass out of the car, motherfucker!

1122
01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:10.189
- Who the fuck are you?
- Holy fucking fuck-balls!

1123
01:30:10.655 --> 01:30:14.648
Okay, my bad.

1124
01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:16.324
Now, I thought you were someone else,
all right?

1125
01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:21.781
You done fouled up my ride,
so I'm gonna have to take yours.

1126
01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:23.747
Fuck that shit.

1127
01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.751
Here you go. Pulls to the left.

1128
01:30:28.715 --> 01:30:30.706
What the fuck, dumb-ass?

1129
01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:36.761
Oh, shit!

1130
01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:44.095
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, shit!

1131
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:46.350
Hey, highlights, back it up.

1132
01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:49.190
Bite my dick, asshole!

1133
01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:57.445
Ow! What the fuck you do that for?

1134
01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:00.527
Lance? What the fuck is going on?

1135
01:31:00.622 --> 01:31:02.237
That's the son of a
bitch I was looking for!

1136
01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:04.914
Hey, guy. How'd you...

1137
01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.827
- Found your computer maps, douche-bag!
- Okay.

1138
01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:13.006
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Boat show,
you and your boyfriend bring it in here.

1139
01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:14.333
I don't need no trouble right now.

1140
01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:16.292
Let's go. Bring it in.

1141
01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:21.431
- Bobby Jo, who the fuck is that?
- Who?

1142
01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:23.930
- That!
- Son of a bitch!

1143
01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:27.724
Come on, darling.

1144
01:31:27.816 --> 01:31:30.148
- Shut up!
- Now, take it easy on the hair.

1145
01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:32.647
- Get down!
- Hey, hey, come on.

1146
01:31:33.029 --> 01:31:36.146
- All right, all right.
- Take your hands off her!

1147
01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:50.827
- Holy loud!
- People are in the vehicle.

1148
01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:57.925
Please! No!

1149
01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:06.927
- All right. Get back, man.
- Ian?

1150
01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:09.725
Everybody just be cool.

1151
01:32:09.816 --> 01:32:12.353
- Felicia, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1152
01:32:12.444 --> 01:32:15.527
Ian, give me the goddamn gun
before you shoot your dick off.

1153
01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:16.773
- Rex, I got this.
- Ian!

1154
01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:20.357
God damn it, Rex, I got this!
Do not fuck with me! Not now!

1155
01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:24.611
Ease it back, man.
That donut ain't fucking around.

1156
01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.456
Hands where I can see them.

1157
01:32:29.461 --> 01:32:33.545
- Ian, dude, you're working the mouth.
- I don't give a shit!

1158
01:32:33.631 --> 01:32:37.749
Okay. All right, sorry.
You're doing so good. Proud of you.

1159
01:32:37.844 --> 01:32:39.505
I mean that. I don't say it enough.

1160
01:32:39.596 --> 01:32:43.805
All right, you, corn-fed, you can
punch my friend Lance, but just once.

1161
01:32:43.892 --> 01:32:47.055
- Dude! What the fuck?
- You nailed his girlfriend.

1162
01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:50.262
- Not exactly. I mean, it was...
- And he came all this way.

1163
01:32:50.356 --> 01:32:53.894
All right. All right, fair enough.
Just not in the nuts.

1164
01:32:57.489 --> 01:33:02.734
- Oh, shit!
- Okay. Okay, all right.

1165
01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:09.281
What a punch.
I think my kids are gonna be retarded.

1166
01:33:09.375 --> 01:33:11.240
You got a fucking cannon for an arm, dude.

1167
01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:16.672
- Yeah, you got a little...
- Thanks. My ears are ringing.

1168
01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:19.131
Stop it! I'm warning you!

1169
01:33:19.219 --> 01:33:22.052
Come on, bro. You ain't gonna kill no one.

1170
01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.129
Whoa!

1171
01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:30.643
- Anybody can shoot a gun in the air, dude.
- I'll shoot you in the leg.

1172
01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:32.561
Smoke that cock, Ian!

1173
01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:35.807
I don't think you got the plums, boy.

1174
01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:41.400
God!

1175
01:33:47.747 --> 01:33:50.033
Okay. Okay.

1176
01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:54.827
Anybody can shoot someone
in the leg, dude.

1177
01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:59.335
- Give me the gun!
- Jesus, man, what do I got to do?

1178
01:34:02.345 --> 01:34:05.303
Don't move, asshole,
or you're a fucking stain.

1179
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:06.550
Okay.

1180
01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:11.142
Holy shit, Ian. Right on!

1181
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:13.470
Where do you think you're going, bitch?

1182
01:34:13.565 --> 01:34:14.975
Cat fight!

1183
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:22.611
Damn you, whore!

1184
01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:26.065
Fuck you!

1185
01:34:42.969 --> 01:34:45.085
Drop the weapon, donut man!

1186
01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:48.846
Okay, put your hands on your head!

1187
01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:52.471
- Both hands, asshole!
- I can't move the other arm.

1188
01:34:52.562 --> 01:34:56.271
- Who said that? Who said that?
- I can't move the other arm.

1189
01:34:59.152 --> 01:35:02.189
Sir, I'm not resisting. It's foam, sir.

1190
01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:09.780
The big Mexican won't go down!
Take the shot!

1191
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.195
- Holy shit!
- No! Jesus!

1192
01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:15.123
Hold your fire! Hold your fire, okay?

1193
01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:19.039
He is not the bad guy!
She is the car thief.

1194
01:35:20.089 --> 01:35:23.627
Right there.
The blond, in a belt for a skirt.

1195
01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:33.383
Anything else?

1196
01:35:35.146 --> 01:35:38.058
Oh, yeah,
apparently there's a guy named Luis,

1197
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:41.232
and he has a chop shop
at 5th and Crescent!

1198
01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:43.066
Thanks.

1199
01:35:43.154 --> 01:35:44.485
We were just banging that chick in our car.

1200
01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.689
- Yeah, you mentioned that.
- Yeah, super hard.

1201
01:35:47.784 --> 01:35:53.780
The boy did have some plums.
Oh, God! He had some plums.

1202
01:35:53.873 --> 01:35:57.036
Hey, this is Rick.
He's played arena football.

1203
01:35:57.126 --> 01:35:59.412
- Hi. I'm Mary.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

1204
01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:01.165
That's a weird little dude you got there.

1205
01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:02.245
Are you guys hungry?

1206
01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.501
Is this place open 24 hours?

1207
01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:09.468
Thank you for coming for me.

1208
01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:13.548
What were you doing in the back seat?

1209
01:36:13.643 --> 01:36:16.806
Nothing. I was...

1210
01:36:16.896 --> 01:36:20.855
- You were stalking me.
- No, I wasn't. I was just...

1211
01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:26.152
Okay. Yeah,
I was stalking you just a little.

1212
01:36:27.657 --> 01:36:31.149
I just... I knew you were gonna do
something you were gonna regret, and I...

1213
01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:35.408
Felicia. Why can't you just say it?

1214
01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:44.295
- Why can't you?
- Well, I asked you first.

1215
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:54.051
Fine. I'll say it.

1216
01:37:00.732 --> 01:37:04.350
- You love me.
- Fine.

1217
01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:08.318
You love me, too, then.

1218
01:37:25.757 --> 01:37:26.792
Thank God.

1219
01:37:44.317 --> 01:37:46.399
You fucking heifer.

1220
01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:01.577
- You fixed it!
- Yeah.

1221
01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:03.282
Don't lean on it.

1222
01:38:05.755 --> 01:38:08.041
I guess you get to live.

1223
01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:10.794
- You guys are amazing.
- Thanks.

1224
01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:12.709
Let's talk seriously for a second.

1225
01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:18.299
I figure with the parts and labor,
you know, out the door... 4,200.

1226
01:38:20.478 --> 01:38:21.638
Oh. Um...

1227
01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:22.718
It's just a round number.

1228
01:38:22.814 --> 01:38:25.305
Yeah. No, I didn't really...

1229
01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:30.772
I don't know what to...

1230
01:38:30.863 --> 01:38:33.479
I'm fucking with you, Ian. We're good, man.

1231
01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:38.075
- Wait, I mean, you're serious?
- Yeah. I'm serious. We're good. No worries.

1232
01:38:38.162 --> 01:38:39.493
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

1233
01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:40.569
- Thank you, man.
- It's what I live for,

1234
01:38:40.665 --> 01:38:43.202
fixing other people's shit for free.

1235
01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:47.334
Yeah.

1236
01:38:52.844 --> 01:38:55.176
- Hey.
- Straight home, pussy!

1237
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:59.673
- Dude, we got to go.
- Fucking piece of shit!

1238
01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:03.427
You go on ahead.
I think I'm gonna stay here, kick it Amish.

1239
01:39:03.521 --> 01:39:05.386
Dude, what are you talking about?

1240
01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:09.015
I don't know, a little hard work,
fresh air, missionary position.

1241
01:39:09.861 --> 01:39:11.601
It's a man's life.

1242
01:39:11.696 --> 01:39:13.357
- Sounds pretty good, you know.
- Yeah, it sounds...

1243
01:39:13.448 --> 01:39:16.064
Come on, Lance. Get serious.

1244
01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:21.903
Come here.

1245
01:39:22.874 --> 01:39:25.741
I got to tell you, I'm impressed.
I'm proud of you, you know.

1246
01:39:25.835 --> 01:39:28.918
You held out for a good one,
the one you wanted.

1247
01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:32.041
And you fucking made it happen.

1248
01:39:33.384 --> 01:39:38.174
But, please, I'm begging you,
go take that girl to visit Grandma.

1249
01:39:38.264 --> 01:39:40.505
- All right.
- And when you do, don't...

1250
01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:43.808
- Lance, I got it.
- Yeah?

1251
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:46.344
Yeah.

1252
01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:50.397
Okay. I think you might.

1253
01:39:50.985 --> 01:39:52.725
- See you.
- Bye.

1254
01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:35.519
- Are you sure you're ready?
- Yeah.

1255
01:40:37.657 --> 01:40:40.399
All right, well, come on, take them off.

1256
01:40:52.797 --> 01:40:54.162
Let's do it.

1257
01:41:14.068 --> 01:41:16.309
Fuck!
Don't start your fucking shit with me.

1258
01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:19.521
You know what? Fuck you!
I want a divorce.

1259
01:41:19.615 --> 01:41:22.652
<i> A few weeks later,
I was Felicia's date to Tiffany's wedding. </i>

1260
01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:26.156
<i> But this time,
it wasn't a just-friends kind of thing. </i>

1261
01:41:28.457 --> 01:41:31.324
<i> And Rex did make my life
hell for a while. </i>

1262
01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:33.750
<i> But that Thanksgiving, </i>

1263
01:41:33.838 --> 01:41:37.171
<i> we finally found out
what's been up his ass all these years. </i>

1264
01:41:37.258 --> 01:41:41.092
I'm gay! And, so, that's it.

1265
01:41:43.598 --> 01:41:46.089
<i> By Christmas,
my dad got used to the idea. </i>

1266
01:41:46.183 --> 01:41:49.141
<i> And Rex is actually
a pretty great guy these days. </i>

1267
01:41:49.228 --> 01:41:51.970
<i> Yeah, now he only uses the word faggot
during rough sex. </i>

1268
01:41:52.064 --> 01:41:54.601
Karen and I want you to have this,
for Christmas.

1269
01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:56.683
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.

1270
01:41:59.155 --> 01:42:00.440
A juicer.

1271
01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:05.901
Oh, my gosh! That's so awesome.
Wow, I got to get some fruit.

1272
01:42:06.412 --> 01:42:07.492
Wow!

1273
01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:12.952
Thank you, thank you.

1274
01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:16.878
<i> And on New Year's Eve,
Felicia and I finally visited Grandma. </i>

1275
01:42:17.256 --> 01:42:19.212
- Again?
- Really?

1276
01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:21.924
<i> Twice. </i>

1277
01:42:32.271 --> 01:42:34.057
Oh, that was awesome!

1278
01:43:14.313 --> 01:43:18.226
- Hey, boys. You get some rest?
- Thanks, man. Thanks for fixing the bus.

1279
01:43:18.317 --> 01:43:20.057
- A pleasure.
- Yeah, thanks for fixing our bus.

1280
01:43:20.152 --> 01:43:22.518
- Appreciate it.
- Thanks for playing that show for us, too.

1281
01:43:22.613 --> 01:43:25.946
- Yeah, no worries.
- It was a nice five-song set.

1282
01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:28.399
Yeah, what do you guys typically...

1283
01:43:28.494 --> 01:43:31.076
I assume you get compensated
very well for that.

1284
01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:34.030
- Must be a good living.
- Yeah, we do. I mean...

1285
01:43:34.125 --> 01:43:36.992
Yeah, you know, I...
Gosh, if I was really to calculate

1286
01:43:37.086 --> 01:43:40.169
what you'd lose if this bus
couldn't have gotten back on the road,

1287
01:43:40.256 --> 01:43:41.462
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

1288
01:43:41.549 --> 01:43:46.464
I imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "I need to dance."

1289
01:43:46.554 --> 01:43:49.216
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

1290
01:43:49.306 --> 01:43:52.343
- Some autographed photos?
- Or we could give you CDs.

1291
01:43:52.435 --> 01:43:54.642
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

1292
01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:57.015
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

1293
01:43:57.106 --> 01:43:58.846
You guys are some strapping young lads.

1294
01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:01.307
I don't know if we're
really built for that.

1295
01:44:02.945 --> 01:44:05.357
- Yeah.
- I can hear you.

1296
01:44:05.448 --> 01:44:07.564
I'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

1297
01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:09.273
- we spent all night on the bus...
- Yeah.

1298
01:44:09.368 --> 01:44:10.653
I mean, that was a lot of work.

1299
01:44:10.745 --> 01:44:13.031
We could maybe try
to write a cheque later on,

1300
01:44:13.122 --> 01:44:15.158
or like I said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

1301
01:44:15.249 --> 01:44:17.786
City folk are always trying
to solve things with money.

1302
01:44:17.877 --> 01:44:19.959
It's the spirit of the community
around here.

1303
01:44:20.045 --> 01:44:22.536
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

1304
01:44:22.631 --> 01:44:25.293
Keep him safe on the road.

1305
01:44:25.384 --> 01:44:28.467
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

1306
01:44:28.554 --> 01:44:29.669
- Help him to...
- Thanks.

1307
01:44:29.764 --> 01:44:31.755
- Okay, thanks, man.
- Thanks, man. We got to roll.

1308
01:44:31.849 --> 01:44:33.760
- Amen.
- We got to roll, man. Thank you very much.

1309
01:44:33.851 --> 01:44:35.432
All right, boys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

1310
01:44:35.519 --> 01:44:38.477
I loved your penis on the Internet,
by the way.

1311
01:44:38.564 --> 01:44:40.930
- Fucking asshole!
- You're a dick!

1312
01:49:04.663 --> 01:49:06.574
This is a serious matter.

1313
01:49:07.124 --> 01:49:08.113
Run for your life.

1314
01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.574
Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

1315
01:49:12.129 --> 01:49:14.996
- All right. We'll shoot another. Cut.
- Cut.
