1
00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.864
Read the charges.

2
00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.491
Dr. Jumba Jookiba,

3
00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:37.870
lead scientist of
Galaxy Defense Industries,

4
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.372
you stand before this council

5
00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:45.461
accused of illegal
genetic experimentation.

6
00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.510
How do you plead?

7
00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.054
Not guilty!

8
00:00:55.096 --> 00:01:00.684
My experiments are only theoretical,
completely within legal boundaries.

9
00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:05.064
We believe you actually
created something.

10
00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.399
Created something?

11
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:11.195
But that would be
irresponsible and unethical.

12
00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.405
I would never, ever,

13
00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.742
make more than one.

14
00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.668
What is that monstrosity?

15
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.462
Monstrosity?

16
00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:33.467
What you see before you is
the first of a new species.

17
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:37.471
I call it Experiment 626.

18
00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.350
He is bulletproof, fireproof

19
00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.103
and can think faster
than supercomputer.

20
00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:49.233
He can see in the dark
and move objects 3,000 times his size.

21
00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:54.279
His only instinct,
to destroy everything he touches!

22
00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.033
So it is a monster.

23
00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.368
Hey, just a little one.

24
00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:02.663
It is an affront to nature.
It must be destroyed!

25
00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:07.459
Calm yourself, Captain Gantu.
Perhaps it can be reasoned with.

26
00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:13.799
Experiment 626, give us some sign
you understand any of this.

27
00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:18.470
Show us that there is something
inside you that is good.

28
00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.648
So naughty!

29
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.819
I didn't teach it that.

30
00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.655
Place that idiot scientist under arrest!

31
00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:41.535
I prefer to be called "evil genius"!

32
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.163
And as for that abomination,

33
00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:48.000
it is the flawed product
of a deranged mind.

34
00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:50.210
It has no place among us.

35
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:53.463
Captain Gantu, take him away.

36
00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.382
With pleasure.

37
00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.863
Uncomfortable?

38
00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.199
Good!

39
00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:24.453
The council has banished you
to exile on a desert asteroid.

40
00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.623
So relax, enjoy the trip,

41
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:30.042
and don't get any ideas.

42
00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.503
These guns are locked
onto your genetic signature.

43
00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.381
They won't shoot anyone but you.

44
00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.800
Why, you...

45
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.554
May I remind the Captain
that he is on duty?

46
00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:45.724
Secure the cell!

47
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.309
Aye, Captain.

48
00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.481
Captain on deck.

49
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.651
All ahead full.

50
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:02.866
Does this look infected to you?

51
00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:32.980
Quiet, you.

52
00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:38.902
- Gunfire in the cell bay!
- Open a channel.

53
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.747
He's loose on Deck C!

54
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.040
Red alert. Seal off the deck!

55
00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.426
Security, converge on Door 7!

56
00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:07.097
Deadly force authorized. Fire on sight!
Fire on sight!

57
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.598
There he is!

58
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.313
Security to Bridge.

59
00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.648
It's in the ventilation system.

60
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.487
He's headed for the power grid.

61
00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:27.326
What was that?

62
00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:29.828
I don't think he's on the ship anymore.

63
00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:32.205
Confirmed. He's taken a police cruiser.

64
00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.543
Yeah, he took the red one.

65
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.360
That's it! We've got it. We've got it!

66
00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:07.532
Hyperdrive activated.
System charging.

67
00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.659
He's engaged his H-drive!

68
00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:12.037
Warning, guidance is not functional.

69
00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:15.040
Pursuit Commander, that crazy trog
is about to make a jump!

70
00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:17.626
Break formation! Get clear of that ship!

71
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.671
Navigation failure. Do not engage...

72
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.392
Get me Galactic Control.

73
00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:36.561
Where is he?

74
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.063
He's still in hyperspace.

75
00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:39.398
Where will he exit?

76
00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:40.732
Calculating now.

77
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:44.903
Quadrant 17, section 005, area 51.

78
00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:47.572
A planet called Ee-arth.

79
00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:50.534
I want an expert on this planet
in here now!

80
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.412
What is that?

81
00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:55.330
Water. Most of the planet is
covered in it.

82
00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:59.251
He won't survive in water.
His molecular density is too great.

83
00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:05.173
No.

84
00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.721
Of course.

85
00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:14.266
How much time do we have?

86
00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:17.936
We have projected his landing
at three hours, 42 minutes.

87
00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.688
We have to gas the planet.

88
00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:22.983
Hold it! Hold everything!

89
00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:25.777
Earth is a protected wildlife reserve.

90
00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.989
Yeah. We've been using it
to rebuild the mosquito population,

91
00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:32.367
which, need I remind you,
is an endangered species!

92
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:35.245
Am I to assume you are the expert?

93
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.622
I don't know about "expert."

94
00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:41.710
Agent Pleakley at your service.

95
00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:43.545
Can we not simply destroy the island?

96
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.338
No! Crazy head!

97
00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:48.633
The mosquito's food of choice,
primitive humanoid life forms,

98
00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:51.303
have colonies all over that planet.

99
00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:52.637
Are they intelligent?

100
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.140
No, but they're very delicate.

101
00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.267
In fact, every time an asteroid strikes
their planet,

102
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.145
they have to begin life all over.

103
00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:02.898
It's fascinating, isn't it?
With this, I've been able to study...

104
00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.984
What if our military forces
just landed there?

105
00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:07.694
Well, that'd be a bad idea!

106
00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:10.906
These are extremely
simple creatures, miss.

107
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.992
Landing there would create
mass mayhem and planet-wide panic!

108
00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:17.037
A quiet capture would require
an understanding of 626

109
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.622
that we do not possess.

110
00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:23.084
Who, then, Mr. Pleakley,
would you send for his extraction?

111
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.546
Does he have a brother?

112
00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:28.882
Close grandmother, perhaps?

113
00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:34.763
Friendly cousin?

114
00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.723
Neighbor with a beard?

115
00:08:58.663 --> 00:08:59.871
He got away?

116
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.374
I'm sure this comes
as no surprise to you.

117
00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:05.877
I designed this creature
for to be unstoppable.

118
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.672
Which is precisely why
you must now bring him back.

119
00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.048
What, me?

120
00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:12.050
And to reward you,

121
00:09:12.093 --> 00:09:16.888
we are willing to trade
your freedom for his capture.

122
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.227
626 will not come easily.

123
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.481
Maybe direct hit from plasma cannon
might stun him long enough to...

124
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:30.277
Plasma cannon granted.
Do we have a bargain, Dr. Jumba?

125
00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:35.991
But it's a delicate planet!
Who's going to control him?

126
00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.951
You will.

127
00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:41.454
Very good, Your Highness.
I didn't quite...

128
00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:42.581
You're not joking!

129
00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:46.793
So, tell me, my little one-eyed one,

130
00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:51.548
on what poor, pitiful,
defenseless planet

131
00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:57.095
has my monstrosity been unleashed?

132
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.412
Stop. Stop.

133
00:12:27.496 --> 00:12:30.957
Lilo, why are you all wet?

134
00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:32.751
It's sandwich day.

135
00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:39.257
Every Thursday, I take Pudge the fish
a peanut-butter sandwich.

136
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.759
Pudge is a fish?

137
00:12:40.801 --> 00:12:43.428
And today
we were out of peanut butter.

138
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.891
So I asked my sister what to give him,
and she said a tuna sandwich.

139
00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:50.268
I can't give Pudge tuna!

140
00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:53.354
Do you know what tuna is?

141
00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.857
- Fish?
- It's fish!

142
00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:59.944
If I gave Pudge tuna,
I'd be an abomination!

143
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:02.113
I'm late because I had to go to the store

144
00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:06.242
and get peanut butter,
'cause all we have is stinking tuna!

145
00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:09.496
Lilo, Lilo, why is this so important?

146
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.664
Pudge controls the weather.

147
00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:15.585
You're crazy.

148
00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.256
Please! Please!

149
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:23.301
Everybody calm down!

150
00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:24.469
Girls.

151
00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.682
- Lilo...
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

152
00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:31.226
I won't do it again!

153
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.478
Maybe we should call your sister.

154
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.981
No! I'll be good! I want to dance.

155
00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.067
I practiced.

156
00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.444
I just want to dance.

157
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.196
I practiced.

158
00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:46.491
She bit me.

159
00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:56.501
I called your sister.

160
00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:59.420
She said to wait for her
here on the porch.

161
00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:02.507
We'll try again on Sunday.

162
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.432
Does this look infected to you?

163
00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.600
Yeah.

164
00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:16.229
You better not have rabies.

165
00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:19.858
If you have rabies,
the dogcatcher is going to have to cut...

166
00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:22.652
Are you going to play dolls?

167
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.196
You don't have a doll.

168
00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.198
This is Scrump.

169
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:29.868
I made her, but her head is too big.

170
00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:33.371
So I pretend a bug laid eggs
in her ears, and she's upset,

171
00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:36.332
because she only has
a few more days to...

172
00:14:56.103 --> 00:14:57.228
Lilo!

173
00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:04.444
Lilo?

174
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:07.322
Oh, no.

175
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.743
You better be home.

176
00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.290
Hey! Watch where you're going!

177
00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.334
Stupid head!

178
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:29.844
Lilo!

179
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:32.430
Lilo! Open the door, Lilo!

180
00:15:32.514 --> 00:15:33.723
Go away.

181
00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.645
Lilo? We don't have time for this.

182
00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:41.689
Leave me alone to die.

183
00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:45.693
Come on, Lilo, that social worker's
going to be here any minute!

184
00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:08.174
You are so finished when I get in there!

185
00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:17.850
I'm going to stuff you in the blender,
push "purée," then bake you into a pie

186
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.204
and feed it to the social worker!

187
00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:23.731
And when he says, "This is great.
What's your secret?" I'm going to say,

188
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:27.402
"Love and nurturing."

189
00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:29.153
Hi.

190
00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:32.865
You must be the...

191
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.283
The stupid head.

192
00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:39.080
You know, I'm really sorry about that,

193
00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:42.834
and if I'd known who you were,
of course I never would've...

194
00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:43.960
I can pay for that.

195
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.503
It's a rental.

196
00:16:45.587 --> 00:16:47.338
Are you the guardian in question?

197
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:49.841
Yes. I'm Nani.

198
00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:52.343
Nice to meet you, Mister...

199
00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:53.469
Bubbles.

200
00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.680
Mr. Bubbles. That's a strange...

201
00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:56.931
Yes, I know.

202
00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.559
Are you going to invite me in, Nani?

203
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:03.312
I thought we could sit out here and talk.

204
00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.356
I don't think so.

205
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:06.566
Right.

206
00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:10.486
This way.

207
00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.540
Wait here.

208
00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:30.590
Hey!

209
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.303
So, lemonade?

210
00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:38.347
Do you often leave
your sister home alone?

211
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.682
No. Never.

212
00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:43.603
Well, except for just now.

213
00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:47.231
I had to run to the store to get some...

214
00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:52.445
You left the stove on
while you were out?

215
00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:54.530
Low heat! Just a simmer.

216
00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:57.992
It's coming along great.

217
00:17:58.577 --> 00:17:59.786
I found that this morning.

218
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.996
Lilo! There you are.

219
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:06.667
Honey face, this is Mr. Bubbles.

220
00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.419
Nice to meet you.

221
00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:10.588
Your knuckles say "Cobra."

222
00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.885
Cobra Bubbles.

223
00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:19.180
You don't look like a social worker.

224
00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.432
I'm a special classification.

225
00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.935
Did you ever kill anyone?

226
00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.605
We're getting off the subject.

227
00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:30.441
Let's talk about you. Are you happy?

228
00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:36.280
I'm adjusted. I eat four food groups

229
00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.866
and look both ways
before crossing the street

230
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:42.787
and take long naps and get disciplined.

231
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.955
Disciplined?

232
00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:48.417
Yeah. She disciplines me real good.
Sometimes five times a day.

233
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.002
- No.
- With bricks.

234
00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:51.629
Bricks?

235
00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:52.755
In a pillowcase.

236
00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.550
Okay! That's enough sugar for you.

237
00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:58.928
Why don't you run along,
you little cutie?

238
00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.973
The other social workers
just thought she was a scream.

239
00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:03.307
Thirsty?

240
00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:07.979
Let me illuminate to you
the precarious situation

241
00:19:08.063 --> 00:19:10.356
in which you have found yourself.

242
00:19:11.358 --> 00:19:16.320
I am the one they call
when things go wrong,

243
00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:20.199
and things have indeed gone wrong.

244
00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:40.011
My friends need to be punished.

245
00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:47.143
Call me next time
you're left here alone.

246
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:48.394
Yep.

247
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:52.690
In case you're wondering,
this did not go well.

248
00:19:54.276 --> 00:19:56.861
You have three days
to change my mind.

249
00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.706
Lilo!

250
00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:38.819
Why didn't you wait at the school?

251
00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:40.738
You were supposed to wait there!

252
00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:42.198
Lilo!

253
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:45.618
Do you not understand?
Do you want to be taken away?

254
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.703
Answer me!

255
00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.830
- No!
- No, you don't understand?

256
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.916
- No!
- No, what?

257
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.751
No!

258
00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:03.928
You're such a pain!

259
00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:07.139
So why don't you sell me
and buy a rabbit instead?

260
00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:09.892
At least a rabbit would behave
better than you!

261
00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:14.021
Go ahead! Then you'll be happy,
because it'll be smarter than me, too!

262
00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:15.940
And quieter!

263
00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.568
You'll like it, 'cause it's stinky, like you!

264
00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:21.946
Go to your room!

265
00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:24.282
I'm already in my room!

266
00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:40.881
Hey.

267
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.553
I brought you some pizza,
in case you were hungry.

268
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.140
We're a broken family, aren't we?

269
00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:51.642
No.

270
00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:55.062
Maybe a little.

271
00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:59.191
Maybe a lot.

272
00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:01.319
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

273
00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:04.155
We're sisters. It's our job.

274
00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.157
Yeah, well, from now on...

275
00:22:06.199 --> 00:22:08.993
I like you better as a sister than a mom.

276
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:11.662
Yeah?

277
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:16.125
And you like me better as a sister
than a rabbit, right?

278
00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:21.630
Yes.

279
00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.591
Yes, I do.

280
00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.678
I hit Mertle Edmonds today.

281
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:29.013
You hit her?

282
00:22:29.056 --> 00:22:30.681
Before I bit her.

283
00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:33.684
You bit her. Lilo, you shouldn't...

284
00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:35.728
People treat me different.

285
00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:39.899
They just don't know what to say.

286
00:22:39.983 --> 00:22:41.067
I'll tell you what.

287
00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:43.819
If you promise not to fight anymore,

288
00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:48.657
I promise not to yell at you,
except on special occasions.

289
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.911
Tuesdays and bank holidays
would be good.

290
00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:53.996
Yeah? Would that be good?

291
00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:57.041
My camera's full again.

292
00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:59.919
Aren't they beautiful?

293
00:23:10.889 --> 00:23:12.390
A falling star!

294
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:21.023
I call it! Get out! Get out!
I have to make a wish!

295
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.983
Can't you go any faster?

296
00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:25.569
Oh, no! Gravity is increasing on me.

297
00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:26.987
No, it's not!

298
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:29.949
It is, too, Lilo.
The same thing happened yesterday.

299
00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:33.786
You rotten sister!
Your butt is crushing me!

300
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.871
Why do you act so weird?

301
00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.669
It's me again.

302
00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:47.925
I need someone to be my friend,
someone who won't run away.

303
00:23:48.009 --> 00:23:53.389
Maybe send me an angel,
the nicest angel you have.

304
00:24:41.521 --> 00:24:43.147
What we when hit?

305
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.569
There it is.
It stayed jammed under the fender.

306
00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.740
We better call somebody.

307
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.676
We're looking for something
that can defend itself,

308
00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:16.305
something that won't die,
something sturdy, you know?

309
00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:17.556
Like a lobster.

310
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:20.392
Lilo, you lolo.
Do we have a lobster door?

311
00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:23.145
No. We have a dog door.
We are getting a dog.

312
00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:32.446
So nice to see your pretty face again!

313
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:33.572
Jumba?

314
00:25:33.657 --> 00:25:37.076
We need your name and address
at the bottom of the form...

315
00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:41.288
The kennel's back this way.

316
00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:43.123
Go. Pick someone out.

317
00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:51.131
Hello?

318
00:25:53.134 --> 00:25:55.469
Are there any "aminals" in here?

319
00:26:02.936 --> 00:26:04.144
Hello!

320
00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:19.243
Hi.

321
00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:22.079
Wow!

322
00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:25.916
Yes. All of our dogs are adoptable.

323
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:28.085
Except that one!

324
00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:29.420
What is that thing?

325
00:26:29.462 --> 00:26:32.131
A dog, I think,
but it was dead this morning.

326
00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:33.757
It was dead this morning?

327
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.427
Well, we thought it was dead.
It was hit by a truck.

328
00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:39.096
I like him! Come here, boy.

329
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:46.145
Wouldn't you like a different dog?

330
00:26:46.229 --> 00:26:48.439
We have better dogs, dear.

331
00:26:48.523 --> 00:26:52.192
Not better than him.
He can talk! Say hello.

332
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.613
Dogs can't talk, dear.

333
00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:56.739
He did.

334
00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:59.199
Does it have to be this dog?

335
00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:05.831
Yes, he's good. I can tell.

336
00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:08.000
You'll have to think of a name for him.

337
00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:11.086
His name is Stitch.

338
00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:13.672
Now, that's not a real name

339
00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:17.384
in Iceland, but here it's a good name.

340
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:18.927
Stitch it is.

341
00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.554
And there's a $2 license fee.

342
00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:22.306
I want to buy him!

343
00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:24.516
Can I borrow $2?

344
00:27:30.357 --> 00:27:31.982
He's all yours.

345
00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:34.652
You're all mine.

346
00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:35.903
Well, what's he doing?

347
00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:39.198
Keep quiet. He's listening for us.

348
00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:45.704
How good is his hearing?
I mean, can he...

349
00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:53.879
Why don't you run?

350
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:57.966
Coming! I'm coming!

351
00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:59.259
Stop!

352
00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:03.097
I have just determined this situation
to be far too hazardous!

353
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.682
Don't worry, I won't hit her.

354
00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:08.936
No! That girl is a part
of the mosquito food chain.

355
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.188
Here! Educate yourself.

356
00:28:12.315 --> 00:28:16.652
Using a little girl for a shield.
This is low even for you!

357
00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:22.074
Tear him apart
with all both my bare hands!

358
00:28:22.158 --> 00:28:23.909
Have you lost your mind?

359
00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:25.703
What is it, Stitch?

360
00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:27.996
We cannot be seen!

361
00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:31.041
Bad dog, barking at nothing!

362
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:36.380
You can't shoot, and you can't be seen.

363
00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:40.759
Look at you! You look like a monster.
We have to blend in.

364
00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:43.846
Okay, I got to get to work.

365
00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.515
Stick around town
and stay out of the roads, okay?

366
00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:48.392
I'll meet you at 1:00.

367
00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:59.903
Okay, I guess we should be going.

368
00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:02.906
What about Stitch?

369
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:11.165
My friends!

370
00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:17.045
What do you want?

371
00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:22.050
I'm sorry I bit you and pulled your hair
and punched you in the face.

372
00:29:22.093 --> 00:29:24.219
Apology not accepted.

373
00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:27.181
Now get out of my way
before I run you over.

374
00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:30.559
I got a new dog. His name is Stitch.

375
00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:34.772
That is the ugliest thing
I have ever saw.

376
00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:36.440
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

377
00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:40.360
Get it away from me!
I'm gonna get a disease!

378
00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:46.116
Somebody do something!

379
00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:47.910
Oh, great! He's loose.

380
00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:50.537
His destructive programming
is taking effect.

381
00:29:50.622 --> 00:29:53.457
He will be irresistibly drawn
to large cities

382
00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:55.083
where he will back up sewers,

383
00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:57.920
reverse street signs
and steal everyone's left shoe.

384
00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:20.150
It's nice to live on an island
with no large cities.

385
00:30:23.988 --> 00:30:25.489
Are you okay?

386
00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:01.149
Hey, over here, little buddy.

387
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:40.731
When you're ready to give up,
just let us know.

388
00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:48.113
Yeah!

389
00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:21.939
This is you.

390
00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:25.651
This is your badness level.

391
00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:29.154
It's unusually high
for someone your size.

392
00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:30.697
We have to fix that.

393
00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:32.574
Lilo!

394
00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.618
Your dog cannot sit at the table.

395
00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:37.704
Stitch is troubled. He needs desserts.

396
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:39.873
You didn't even eat your sweet potato.

397
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:41.416
I thought you liked them.

398
00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:42.793
Desserts!

399
00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:49.007
David!

400
00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:50.801
I got a new dog.

401
00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:53.595
You sure it's a dog?

402
00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:57.391
He used to be a collie
before he got ran over.

403
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:02.521
Hey.

404
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.489
How's it, Nani?

405
00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:15.617
Did you catch fire again?

406
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.494
Nah, just the stage.

407
00:33:17.578 --> 00:33:21.373
Listen, I was wondering
if you're not doing anything this...

408
00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:24.543
David, I told you, I can't. I...

409
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.005
I got a lot to deal with right now.

410
00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:30.424
I know. I just figured
you might need some time...

411
00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:32.634
You smell like a lawn mower.

412
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.595
Look, I got to go.

413
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.848
The kid at Table 3's
throwing poi again.

414
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.058
Maybe some other time, okay?

415
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:42.144
Don't worry.

416
00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:44.521
She likes your butt and fancy hair.

417
00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:46.940
I know. I read her diary.

418
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.859
She thinks it's fancy?

419
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:06.209
Look what I find! Get restraints!

420
00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:08.962
- Right.
- Take that! Hurry!

421
00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:11.339
Hold still just a...

422
00:34:27.356 --> 00:34:28.648
Hey, Nani!

423
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:32.069
Is that your dog?

424
00:34:32.862 --> 00:34:34.071
All is well.

425
00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.448
Please, go about your business.
I'm okay.

426
00:34:36.532 --> 00:34:39.076
Your head looks swollen.

427
00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:41.244
Actually, she's just ugly.

428
00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:44.664
Darling. He's joking.

429
00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:46.875
Ugly, look at me.

430
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:49.002
This is not working out.

431
00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:50.378
But...

432
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:52.923
Yeah?

433
00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:57.677
Well, who wants to work
at this stupid fakey luau anyway?

434
00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.638
Come on, Lilo.

435
00:35:04.727 --> 00:35:07.938
Did you lose your job
because of Stitch and me?

436
00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:10.607
Nah. The manager's a vampire,

437
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:14.236
and he wanted me to join
his legion of the undead.

438
00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:15.779
I knew it.

439
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.200
This is a great home. You'll like it a lot.

440
00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:22.994
See?

441
00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.454
Lilo...

442
00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:25.789
Comfy.

443
00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:28.250
- Hey!
- Hey!

444
00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:29.626
What is the matter with you?

445
00:35:29.669 --> 00:35:32.462
Be careful of the little angel!

446
00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:35.215
It's not an angel, Lilo.
I don't even think it's a dog.

447
00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:36.550
We just have to take him back.

448
00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:39.219
He's just cranky
because it's his bedtime.

449
00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:40.595
He's creepy, Lilo.

450
00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:43.557
I won't sleep
knowing he's loose in the house.

451
00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:47.310
You're loose in the house all the time,
and I sleep just fine!

452
00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:49.146
Hey, what are you doing?

453
00:35:49.188 --> 00:35:50.814
Stop that, Stitch!

454
00:35:50.898 --> 00:35:52.107
Hey!

455
00:35:54.527 --> 00:35:55.610
Look at him, Lilo.

456
00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:58.029
He's obviously mutated
from something else.

457
00:35:58.114 --> 00:35:59.948
We have to take him back.

458
00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:02.617
He was an orphan,
and we adopted him!

459
00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.327
What about 'ohana?

460
00:36:04.412 --> 00:36:06.204
He hasn't been here that long.

461
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:09.958
Neither have I.
Dad said 'ohana means "family."

462
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:16.298
'Ohana means "family."

463
00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.426
- "Family" means...
- Nobody gets left behind.

464
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.928
- Or?
- Or forgotten.

465
00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:26.349
I know. I know. I hate it
when you use 'ohana against me.

466
00:36:30.897 --> 00:36:33.773
Don't worry,
you can sleep right next to me.

467
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.907
Look how curious the puppy is.

468
00:36:41.991 --> 00:36:45.202
This is my room, and this is your bed.

469
00:36:46.495 --> 00:36:48.788
This is your dolly and bottle.

470
00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:50.999
See? Doesn't spill.

471
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.293
I filled it with coffee.

472
00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:55.879
Good puppy. Now get into bed.

473
00:36:57.673 --> 00:36:59.674
Hey! That's mine!

474
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.887
Down!

475
00:37:06.849 --> 00:37:11.394
Be careful of that! You don't touch this!
Don't ever touch it!

476
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:21.613
No! Don't pull on her head!
She's recovering from surgery.

477
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.660
No! That's from my blue period.

478
00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:34.459
There.

479
00:37:34.543 --> 00:37:37.254
You know, you wreck
everything you touch.

480
00:37:37.296 --> 00:37:40.257
Why not try and make something
for a change?

481
00:37:57.024 --> 00:37:58.775
Wow. San Francisco.

482
00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:11.162
Save me!

483
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.711
No more caffeine for you.

484
00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:23.008
This little girl is wasting her time.

485
00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:26.886
626 cannot be taught to ignore
its destructive programming.

486
00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.350
Push that over.

487
00:38:34.186 --> 00:38:36.313
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

488
00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:39.274
- Say, I want to try it on.
- No!

489
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:40.525
- Share!
- Hey!

490
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:43.653
You're just jealous 'cause I'm pretty!

491
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.113
Don't move.

492
00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:47.866
A mosquito has chosen me
as her perch.

493
00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:50.243
She's so beautiful.

494
00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.954
Look, another one.

495
00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:56.916
And another one!
Why, it's a whole flock.

496
00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:58.168
And they like me!

497
00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.879
They're nuzzling my flesh
with their noses.

498
00:39:00.963 --> 00:39:03.173
Now, they're, they're...

499
00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:10.889
I think it might be a koala, an evil koala.

500
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:12.682
I can't even pet it.

501
00:39:12.725 --> 00:39:15.560
It keeps staring at me,
like it's going to eat me.

502
00:39:19.231 --> 00:39:20.398
Hello?

503
00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:22.859
Nani?

504
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.029
Hello?

505
00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:28.531
Are you there?

506
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.372
- Now, this is interesting.
- What?

507
00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:38.249
626 was designed to be a monster,

508
00:39:38.334 --> 00:39:41.127
but now he has nothing to destroy.

509
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:46.383
You see, I never gave him
a greater purpose.

510
00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:50.428
What must it be like to have nothing,

511
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:54.849
not even memories to visit
in the middle of the night?

512
00:40:04.819 --> 00:40:05.902
Nah!

513
00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:29.968
That's the Ugly Duckling.

514
00:40:30.052 --> 00:40:32.679
See? He's sad because he's all alone

515
00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.389
and nobody wants him.

516
00:40:34.807 --> 00:40:37.434
But on this page,
his family hears him crying

517
00:40:37.476 --> 00:40:39.018
and they find him.

518
00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:41.187
Then the Ugly Duckling is happy,

519
00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:43.690
because he knows where he belongs.

520
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:55.285
Want to listen to the King?

521
00:40:56.328 --> 00:40:58.705
You look like an Elvis fan.

522
00:41:03.085 --> 00:41:04.210
Nani.

523
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:05.795
Nani!

524
00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:08.089
Yeah?

525
00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.299
Look.

526
00:41:32.781 --> 00:41:34.824
Heard you lost your job.

527
00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:39.412
Well, actually, I just quit that job,

528
00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.956
because, you know,
the hours are just not conducive

529
00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:43.791
to the challenges of raising a child...

530
00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:45.001
Hey!

531
00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:46.878
I am so sorry about that.

532
00:41:46.962 --> 00:41:48.755
What is that thing?

533
00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.465
That's my puppy.

534
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:51.674
Really?

535
00:41:55.513 --> 00:42:00.266
Thus far, you have been adrift
in the sheltered harbor of my patience,

536
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:03.228
but I cannot ignore you being jobless.

537
00:42:03.312 --> 00:42:05.939
Do I make myself clear?

538
00:42:06.023 --> 00:42:07.565
Perfectly.

539
00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:12.403
And next time I see this dog, I expect it
to be a model citizen, capisce?

540
00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.198
Yes?

541
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:16.533
New job.

542
00:42:17.117 --> 00:42:18.660
Model citizen.

543
00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:21.663
Good day.

544
00:42:27.127 --> 00:42:28.545
Mrs. Hasagawa?

545
00:42:28.587 --> 00:42:30.630
I'm here to answer your newspaper ad.

546
00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:33.049
Elvis Presley was a model citizen.

547
00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:36.386
I've compiled a list of his traits
for you to practice.

548
00:42:36.428 --> 00:42:39.055
Number one is dancing.

549
00:42:39.139 --> 00:42:40.682
I can't talk now, dear.

550
00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:43.017
I'm waiting for someone
to answer my ad.

551
00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.561
That's why I'm here.

552
00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:46.062
Hands on your hips.

553
00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:47.855
Now follow my lead.

554
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.822
That's my want ad.

555
00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:57.156
I know!

556
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:07.667
Why is everything so dark?

557
00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.919
I am all about coffee.

558
00:43:10.212 --> 00:43:12.297
Let's move on to step two.

559
00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:15.383
Elvis played guitar. Here.

560
00:43:15.426 --> 00:43:18.678
Hold it like this,
and put your fingers here.

561
00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:21.931
See? Now you try.

562
00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:26.561
And I make great cappuccinos
and lattes with...

563
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:29.022
I wish I could, Nani,
but I just hired Teddy,

564
00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:31.357
and with tourist season ending...

565
00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.289
Concierge-er-ing is my life.

566
00:43:46.373 --> 00:43:48.041
I just love to answer phones...

567
00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.918
This is the face of romance.

568
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:54.255
She looks like
she could use some loving.

569
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.886
We might have something.

570
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.638
Good. Now kiss her.

571
00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:07.852
I'm sure Elvis had his bad days, too.

572
00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:09.896
I'm all about saving people.

573
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.357
Actually, I do think
we have an opening.

574
00:44:12.441 --> 00:44:14.734
- Really?
- Okay, this is it.

575
00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.653
Time to bring it all together.

576
00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:18.071
That'd be so great!

577
00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:20.990
You have no idea
how badly I need this job.

578
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.663
It's all you! Knock them dead!

579
00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:50.728
Don't crowd him!

580
00:44:56.694 --> 00:44:58.277
Hey, knock it off!

581
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:38.192
Hey, Lilo!

582
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:40.570
How's it, Nani?

583
00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.448
We've been having a bad day.

584
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.206
Hey, I might not be a doctor,

585
00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:55.626
but I know that there's no better cure
for a sour face

586
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:59.213
than a couple of boards
and some choice waves.

587
00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:00.798
What you think?

588
00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:04.093
I think that's a great idea.

589
00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:07.907
Yeah!

590
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.465
Can't complain, Mom.

591
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.301
I'm camping out
with a convicted criminal,

592
00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:11.220
and I had my head chewed on
by a monster!

593
00:48:11.263 --> 00:48:14.223
Wait, something is not right.

594
00:48:14.266 --> 00:48:17.476
626 is returning willingly to water.

595
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:19.854
Hold on, Mom, another call.

596
00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:24.483
Mr. Pleakley, you are overdue.
I want a status report.

597
00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:26.152
Things are going well.

598
00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:27.445
He cannot swim!

599
00:48:27.529 --> 00:48:29.507
Things are going well.
Jumba, aren't they going well?

600
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:31.449
Why will he risk drowning?

601
00:48:31.533 --> 00:48:34.493
Jumba? Jumba, help me out here.

602
00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:38.080
I would have expected you back
by now with 626 in hand.

603
00:48:38.123 --> 00:48:42.335
Just a few things left to pack,
and we'll be...

604
00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:45.171
Hang up. We are going swimming.

605
00:49:22.876 --> 00:49:25.211
Yeah!

606
00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:36.472
Lilo!

607
00:49:38.058 --> 00:49:39.100
What happened?

608
00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:43.062
Some lolo must have
stuffed us in the barrel.

609
00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:44.647
Where's Stitch?

610
00:49:46.692 --> 00:49:48.150
Get off of her!

611
00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.528
What happened?

612
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:52.571
Stitch dragged her down.

613
00:50:00.872 --> 00:50:02.415
We lost Stitch!

614
00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:33.362
Lilo? Lilo, look at me.
Look at me, baby. Are you hurt?

615
00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:34.613
No.

616
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.495
He's unconscious,
but I think he's alive.

617
00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.136
David, take Lilo.

618
00:50:58.764 --> 00:51:03.184
This isn't what it looks like.
We were... It's just that...

619
00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:09.398
I know you're trying, Nani,

620
00:51:09.483 --> 00:51:13.277
but you need to think about
what's best for Lilo,

621
00:51:13.361 --> 00:51:16.489
even if it removes you from the picture.

622
00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.537
I'll be back tomorrow morning for Lilo.

623
00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:26.248
I'm sorry.

624
00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.883
Nani? Is there something I can do?

625
00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:38.052
No, David.

626
00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:42.431
I need to take Lilo home now.

627
00:51:43.558 --> 00:51:46.519
We have a lot to talk about, you know.

628
00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:47.812
Thanks.

629
00:51:51.733 --> 00:51:55.528
You know, I really believed
they had a chance.

630
00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:59.365
Then you came along.

631
00:52:26.726 --> 00:52:28.185
Lilo, honey,

632
00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.314
we have to...

633
00:52:34.276 --> 00:52:37.987
Don't worry. You're nice,
and someone will give you a job.

634
00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:40.823
I would.

635
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:45.494
Come here.

636
00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:15.983
One fond embrace

637
00:53:21.489 --> 00:53:28.204
Until we meet again

638
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:50.976
That's us before.

639
00:53:52.687 --> 00:53:55.439
It was rainy, and they went for a drive.

640
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.318
What happened to yours?

641
00:54:00.362 --> 00:54:04.365
I hear you cry at night.
Do you dream about them?

642
00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:11.538
I know that's why you wreck things
and push me.

643
00:54:18.296 --> 00:54:22.633
Our family's little now,
and we don't have many toys,

644
00:54:22.717 --> 00:54:25.761
but if you want,
you could be a part of it.

645
00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:30.432
You could be our baby,
and we'd raise you to be good.

646
00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.981
'Ohana means "family."

647
00:54:38.316 --> 00:54:41.610
"Family" means
nobody gets left behind,

648
00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:46.573
but if you want to leave, you can.

649
00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.623
I'll remember you, though.

650
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.586
I remember everyone that leaves.

651
00:55:29.617 --> 00:55:31.160
I...

652
00:55:31.703 --> 00:55:32.953
Lost.

653
00:55:41.338 --> 00:55:42.838
I'm lost.

654
00:55:49.637 --> 00:55:50.888
Help!

655
00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:53.766
I don't like the ocean!

656
00:55:55.852 --> 00:56:00.439
Look, a friendly little dolphin.
They helped sailors in the war...

657
00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:03.650
It's a shark!
It's a shark, and it ain't friendly!

658
00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:06.487
It looks like a dolphin.
Tricky fish! Tricky fish!

659
00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:09.698
Octopus, come and help me?
The octopus is worse than the shark!

660
00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:11.575
I hate this planet!

661
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:23.087
Little monster!

662
00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.553
Agent Pleakley here.

663
00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:33.889
I have lost patience with you both.

664
00:56:33.973 --> 00:56:37.684
Have you captured 626 or not?

665
00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:42.398
Consider yourselves fired
and prison-bound.

666
00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.734
Your incompetence is
nothing short of unspeakable!

667
00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:48.070
But...

668
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.825
We're fired!

669
00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:55.661
Now we do it my way!

670
00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:56.954
Your way?

671
00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:58.789
Wait!

672
00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:02.376
It seems I have overestimated
Jumber and Blinkley.

673
00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:04.294
Jumba and Pleakley.

674
00:57:04.379 --> 00:57:06.964
Whatever. The mission is in jeopardy.

675
00:57:07.048 --> 00:57:12.052
This could be your chance
to redeem yourself, Captain Gantu.

676
00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:15.097
How soon will you be prepared
to leave?

677
00:57:15.974 --> 00:57:17.391
Immediately.

678
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.618
Don't run. Don't make me shoot you.
You were expensive.

679
00:57:38.163 --> 00:57:41.331
Yes. Yes, that's it. Come quietly.

680
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:44.877
Waiting.

681
00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:46.211
For what?

682
00:57:49.507 --> 00:57:50.799
Family.

683
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:55.137
You don't have one.

684
00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:57.639
I made you.

685
00:57:58.391 --> 00:58:01.185
Maybe I could.

686
00:58:01.269 --> 00:58:03.228
You're built to destroy.

687
00:58:03.771 --> 00:58:06.148
You can never belong.

688
00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:11.236
Now come quietly,
and we will take you apart.

689
00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:14.490
No, no, no, no, don't, don't run!
Don't run!

690
00:58:29.464 --> 00:58:30.589
Lilo.

691
00:58:31.925 --> 00:58:33.967
I didn't hear you get up.

692
00:58:36.137 --> 00:58:37.471
Baby, what's wrong?

693
00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:39.348
Stitch left.

694
00:58:39.432 --> 00:58:40.974
Really?

695
00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:42.809
It's good he's gone.

696
00:58:43.311 --> 00:58:45.771
He didn't want to be here, anyway.

697
00:58:46.231 --> 00:58:47.940
We don't need him.

698
00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.111
Lilo,

699
00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:56.698
sometimes you try your hardest,

700
00:58:56.741 --> 00:59:00.369
but things don't work out
the way you want them to.

701
00:59:01.287 --> 00:59:05.207
Sometimes things have to change,

702
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:08.585
and maybe sometimes
they're for the better,

703
00:59:09.254 --> 00:59:10.587
even if...

704
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:13.382
Nani!

705
00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.886
- David!
- I think I found you a job.

706
00:59:17.929 --> 00:59:19.054
You what?

707
00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:21.723
Old man Kuakini's store,
but we got to hurry.

708
00:59:21.808 --> 00:59:26.895
Okay. Lilo?
Baby, this is really important.

709
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.814
I need you to stay here
for a few minutes.

710
00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:30.274
I'm going to be right back.

711
00:59:30.358 --> 00:59:33.610
Lock the door
and don't answer it for anyone, okay?

712
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:37.030
Things are finally turning around.

713
00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:40.242
David, I owe you one.

714
00:59:40.285 --> 00:59:41.410
That's okay.

715
00:59:41.494 --> 00:59:44.413
You can just date me,
and we'll call it even.

716
00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:52.004
Come back here, you little...

717
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:56.758
Stitch?

718
00:59:57.468 --> 00:59:58.760
What is it?

719
01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:05.851
Hiding behind your little friend
won't work anymore.

720
01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:08.895
Didn't I tell you?
We got fired this morning.

721
01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.440
New rules.

722
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.742
What are we going to do?

723
01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:25.120
I love this song!

724
01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:26.371
Pliers.

725
01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:28.457
- Screwdriver.
- Check.

726
01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:32.919
Come out, my friend,
from whomever you're hiding behind.

727
01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:36.548
What the...

728
01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:42.679
Come on! What's the big deal?

729
01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.141
I'll put you back together again.

730
01:00:46.225 --> 01:00:49.144
I'll make you taller and not so fluffy!

731
01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:51.229
I like fluffy!

732
01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:54.149
No. No. No!

733
01:00:56.277 --> 01:00:58.612
Leave my mother out of this!

734
01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:02.824
You could do with a makeover.

735
01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:07.829
I tried to give you my good looks,
but let's face it, something went wrong.

736
01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.247
No!

737
01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.128
Quick! Follow me! If we make it to...

738
01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:18.048
- You're alive!
- They're all over the place!

739
01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:22.678
Running away? Here, let me stop you.

740
01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.682
You always get in the way!

741
01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:28.619
Where's the girl?
What have you done to the girl?

742
01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:32.604
Hello? Cobra Bubbles?
Aliens are attacking my house.

743
01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.065
No, no, no! No aliens!

744
01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:40.070
Blue punch buggy!

745
01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:43.407
No punch back.

746
01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:45.117
They want my dog!

747
01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.119
There's no need to alert the authorities.

748
01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.745
Everything's under control.

749
01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:49.996
Lilo, who was that?

750
01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.207
Good, my dog found the chainsaw.

751
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.417
Lilo! Don't hang...

752
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:04.636
You shouldn't play with guns.

753
01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:05.721
Okay.

754
01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:06.888
Thank you.

755
01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.932
I just remembered. It's your birthday!

756
01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:10.559
Happy birthday!

757
01:02:10.601 --> 01:02:12.352
- Merry Christmas!
- It's not Christmas.

758
01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.437
Happy Hanukkah!

759
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:14.688
We're leaving Stitch?

760
01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.898
Trust me. This is not going to end well.

761
01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:18.233
- One potato.
- Two potato.

762
01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:19.735
- Three potato.
- Four.

763
01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:21.236
- Five potato.
- Six potato.

764
01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.404
Seven potato, more.

765
01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:23.530
- My...
- Mother...

766
01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.614
- Told...
- Me...

767
01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:25.741
- You...
- Are...

768
01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.242
- It.
- I win!

769
01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:37.169
Thanks. Mahalo plenty.
You won't be disappointed.

770
01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:40.130
I'll show up early to help
with the morning...

771
01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:45.260
Don't turn left.

772
01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:49.097
No.

773
01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.564
One of them had a giant eye
in the middle of his face.

774
01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:58.940
Lilo!

775
01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:03.695
Please don't do this.

776
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.238
You know I have no choice.

777
01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:07.282
No! You're not taking her!

778
01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:08.867
I'm the only one who understands her!

779
01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.869
You take that away,
she won't stand a chance!

780
01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:12.954
You're making this harder
than it needs to be.

781
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.957
But you don't know what you're doing!
She needs me!

782
01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.293
Is this what she needs?

783
01:03:18.377 --> 01:03:23.215
It seems clear to me that you need her
a lot more than she needs you.

784
01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.430
Lilo! Lilo!

785
01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:39.182
Lilo!

786
01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:56.456
You ruined everything.

787
01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.633
You're one of them?

788
01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.887
Get out of here, Stitch.

789
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:15.183
Surprise!

790
01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:20.438
And here I thought
you'd be difficult to catch.

791
01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:22.732
Silly me.

792
01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:24.693
Lilo?

793
01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:26.528
Lilo!

794
01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:42.043
There you go,
all buckled up for the trip.

795
01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:47.257
And, look,
I even caught you a little snack.

796
01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.097
No! Stop!

797
01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:06.651
Lilo.

798
01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.615
Okay, talk.

799
01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:12.926
I know you had something
to do with this.

800
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:14.951
Now where is Lilo?

801
01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:17.329
Talk! I know you can.

802
01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.583
Okay, okay.

803
01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.671
Where's Lilo?

804
01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:29.633
Lilo...

805
01:05:32.845 --> 01:05:34.804
Now all your washing is up!

806
01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:37.015
You're under arrest!
Read him his rights.

807
01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:38.725
Listen carefully.

808
01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:45.774
Hello? Galactic Command?
Experiment 626 is in custody.

809
01:05:45.858 --> 01:05:47.776
We'll wait right here.

810
01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.745
Don't interact with her.

811
01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:04.960
Where's Lilo?

812
01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:06.670
Who? What?

813
01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:11.800
Lilo, my sister.

814
01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:19.557
Sorry, we do not know anyone by this...

815
01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.810
Lilo! She's a little girl, this big!

816
01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:26.189
She has black hair and brown eyes,
and she hangs around with that thing!

817
01:06:29.026 --> 01:06:30.443
We know her.

818
01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.821
Bring her back.

819
01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:34.864
We can't do that.

820
01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:37.325
That would be a misuse
of Galactic resources.

821
01:06:37.368 --> 01:06:41.621
See, problem is we're just here for him.

822
01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.790
So she's gone?

823
01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.375
Look at the bright side.

824
01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:48.169
You won't have to yell
at anyone anymore.

825
01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:57.679
Come.

826
01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:10.150
'Ohana.

827
01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.610
Hey! Get away from her.

828
01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:15.196
No! What did you say?

829
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.866
'Ohana means "family."

830
01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:23.747
- "Family" means nobody...
- Nobody gets left behind.

831
01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.832
Or forgotten.

832
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.125
Yeah.

833
01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:30.336
Hey.

834
01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:31.838
What?

835
01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:36.468
After all you put me through, you
expect me to help you just like that?

836
01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.054
Just like that?

837
01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:41.598
Fine.

838
01:07:41.682 --> 01:07:44.225
Fine? You're doing what he says?

839
01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:46.102
He's very persuasive.

840
01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:49.439
Persuasive?
What exactly are we doing?

841
01:07:49.523 --> 01:07:51.900
- Rescue.
- We're going to get Lilo?

842
01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:58.740
Good! I was hoping to add theft,
endangerment

843
01:07:58.824 --> 01:08:01.743
and insanity to my list of things
I did today.

844
01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:03.078
You, too?

845
01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:10.502
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

846
01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:13.296
What? Did you think we walked here?

847
01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.258
This is Gantu,
requesting hyperspace clearance.

848
01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.177
Stand by for clearance.

849
01:09:04.056 --> 01:09:06.307
Clearance is granted on vector C-12.

850
01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:08.476
Connect me
to the Grand Councilwoman.

851
01:09:08.561 --> 01:09:10.562
Gantu, what's going on?

852
01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:15.483
I thought you'd like to know
that the little abomination is...

853
01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.613
Yes, Captain?

854
01:09:23.409 --> 01:09:25.368
I'll call you back.

855
01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.542
How did you get out of there?

856
01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.797
So what exactly are we doing?

857
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.216
Don't worry, is all part of plan.

858
01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.051
We are professionals.

859
01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.179
Hey! Get that out of your mouth!

860
01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.646
Hold on!

861
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:05.575
Okay, is show time!

862
01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:21.341
This is it!

863
01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.390
Go! Go! Go!

864
01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:43.196
Little savage! Get off my ship!

865
01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:49.244
Stitch!

866
01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:06.135
Computer, locate Experiment 626.

867
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.429
626 located.

868
01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:10.556
We finish this now.

869
01:11:13.727 --> 01:11:15.061
Stitch is unconscious.

870
01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:18.731
- What do we do now?
- We stay close. Hope for a miracle.

871
01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.066
That's all we can do.

872
01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:32.662
No!

873
01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:36.416
Don't leave me, okay?

874
01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:44.458
Okay.

875
01:11:55.894 --> 01:11:59.564
Target 626 is in motion. Speed is 84.

876
01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:01.107
Impossible!

877
01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:27.967
Stitch!

878
01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.763
Abomination.

879
01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.181
Stupid head.

880
01:12:43.984 --> 01:12:47.362
You're vile! You're foul! You're flawed!

881
01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:49.822
Also cute and fluffy!

882
01:13:03.295 --> 01:13:04.545
You came back.

883
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.714
Nobody gets left behind.

884
01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:16.557
Lilo!

885
01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:23.898
Good dog.

886
01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.126
David!

887
01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:44.961
Hey, Lilo.

888
01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:47.255
Can you give us a ride to shore?

889
01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.008
Sure,

890
01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.302
but I have to make two trips.

891
01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.224
So you're from outer space?
I heard the surfing's choice.

892
01:13:59.184 --> 01:14:01.018
We have 626.

893
01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.437
Take him to my ship.

894
01:14:02.479 --> 01:14:04.647
- Leave him alone.
- Hold on.

895
01:14:04.731 --> 01:14:06.941
Grand Councilwoman, let me explain.

896
01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.192
Silence!

897
01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:11.237
I am retiring you, Captain Gantu.

898
01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:15.032
Actually, credit for the capture
goes to...

899
01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.701
Goes to me.

900
01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.911
You'll be lucky if you end up
on a Fluff Trog farm

901
01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:21.205
after we sort this thing out.

902
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.708
I think I should...

903
01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:26.169
You! You're the cause of all this!

904
01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:29.130
If it wasn't for your Experiment 626,
none of this...

905
01:14:29.214 --> 01:14:31.507
- Stitch.
- What?

906
01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:33.801
My name Stitch.

907
01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:35.052
Stitch, then.

908
01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.305
If it wasn't for Stitch...

909
01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:42.268
Does Stitch have to go in the ship?

910
01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.770
Yes.

911
01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.814
Can Stitch say goodbye?

912
01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:49.650
Yes.

913
01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:51.110
Thank you.

914
01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.201
Who are you?

915
01:15:00.078 --> 01:15:02.622
This is my family.

916
01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:05.583
I found it all on my own.

917
01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:11.088
It's little and broken, but still good.

918
01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:14.133
Yeah. Still good.

919
01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:26.270
Does he really have to go?

920
01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:30.608
You know as well as I
that our laws are absolute.

921
01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:34.403
I cannot change
what the council has decided.

922
01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:38.491
Lilo, didn't you buy that thing
at the shelter?

923
01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:44.413
Hey!

924
01:15:45.916 --> 01:15:48.668
Three days ago,
I bought Stitch at the shelter.

925
01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:52.380
I paid $2 for him. See this stamp?
I own him.

926
01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:56.217
If you take him, you're stealing.

927
01:15:58.303 --> 01:16:01.430
Aliens are all about rules.

928
01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.891
You look familiar.

929
01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:07.603
CIA. Roswell. 1973.

930
01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.856
Yes. You had hair then.

931
01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.818
Take note of this.

932
01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:18.823
This creature has been sentenced
to life in exile,

933
01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:23.119
a sentence that shall be
henceforth served out here

934
01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.955
on Earth.

935
01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:32.920
And as caretaker
of the alien life form, Stitch,

936
01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:35.673
this family is now
under the official protection

937
01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:38.426
of the United Galactic Federation.

938
01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.971
We'll be checking in now and then.

939
01:16:42.055 --> 01:16:45.266
I was afraid you were going to say that.

940
01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:48.769
This won't be easy to explain
back at headquarters.

941
01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:50.896
I know what you mean.

942
01:16:54.818 --> 01:16:57.320
Don't let those two get on my ship.

943
01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:08.998
CIA?

944
01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:10.166
Former.

945
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.126
Saved the planet once.

946
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:13.461
Convinced an alien race

947
01:17:13.503 --> 01:17:16.589
that mosquitoes were
an endangered species.

948
01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.299
Now, about your house...

949
01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:23.304
Wait.
