1
00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:05.653
Alexander, the army will divide.

2
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.906
Satrapies will revolt.
Without your orders, there'll be war.

3
00:03:09.157 --> 00:03:11.575
We beg you. Tell us who.

4
00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:13.429
Our world is gone now.

5
00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:18.058
I'm the last left alive.

6
00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:23.105
Whether that's a blessing or a curse...

7
00:04:23.273 --> 00:04:25.566
...who by Hades would know.

8
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.155
But l've paid my price...

9
00:04:31.322 --> 00:04:33.031
...in blood.

10
00:04:35.744 --> 00:04:38.412
And in broken dreams.

11
00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.419
They say we were the greatest
fighting force ever known to man.

12
00:04:47.714 --> 00:04:52.259
Greater even than the expedition to Troy.

13
00:04:53.636 --> 00:04:55.262
But how can I say it?

14
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.432
How can l tell you what it is like
to be young...

15
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.102
...and to dream big dreams?

16
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.107
To believe when Alexander looked you
in the eye, you could do anything.

17
00:05:07.275 --> 00:05:08.942
Anything.

18
00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:17.618
In his presence, by the light of Apollo,
we were better than ourselves.

19
00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:24.708
Truly, l've known many great men
in my life...

20
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.795
...but only one colossus.

21
00:05:28.338 --> 00:05:30.506
And only now, when old...

22
00:05:30.673 --> 00:05:35.719
...do l understand
who this force of nature really was.

23
00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.975
Or do I?

24
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:47.481
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not.

25
00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:50.984
We idolize him,
make him better than he was.

26
00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:55.823
Men, all men, reach and fall...

27
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:59.326
...reach and fall.

28
00:06:04.624 --> 00:06:11.004
In the East, the vast Persian Empire
ruled almost all the known world.

29
00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:16.593
In the West,
the once great Greek city-states...

30
00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:21.849
...Thebes, Athens, Sparta,
had fallen from pride.

31
00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:26.854
For 1 00 years now, the Persian kings
had bribed the Greeks...

32
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:30.023
...with their gold
to fight as mercenaries.

33
00:06:30.692 --> 00:06:35.529
It was Philip, the one-eyed,
who changed all this...

34
00:06:35.697 --> 00:06:40.534
...uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands.

35
00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:44.872
With his blood and guts,
he built a professional army...

36
00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.876
...that brought the devious Greeks
to their knees.

37
00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:52.504
He then turned his eye on Persia...

38
00:06:52.672 --> 00:06:56.592
...where it was said the
Great King Darius himself...

39
00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:00.846
...on his throne in Babylon,
feared Philip.

40
00:07:05.268 --> 00:07:07.311
Philip was murdered...

41
00:07:07.478 --> 00:07:11.565
...much to Persia's delight and
perhaps sponsored by their gold.

42
00:07:11.733 --> 00:07:16.904
And Alexander, at 20,
became the new ruler of Macedonia.

43
00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:19.865
Announcing revenge
for the death of Philip...

44
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:24.036
...Alexander liberated
all of the cities of western Asia...

45
00:07:24.203 --> 00:07:26.747
...south to Egypt...

46
00:07:27.123 --> 00:07:30.959
...where he was declared
Pharaoh of Egypt...

47
00:07:31.127 --> 00:07:33.587
...and worshipped as a god.

48
00:07:36.716 --> 00:07:40.552
And finally, he provoked
the rise to battle...

49
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.767
...in the heart of the Persian Empire,
near Babylon.

50
00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:57.778
It was mad.

51
00:07:57.946 --> 00:08:00.447
Forty thousand of us against
hundreds of thousands...

52
00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:03.283
...of barbarian races unknown to us...

53
00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:06.912
...gathered under Darius himself.

54
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:11.249
East and west had now come together...

55
00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:14.962
...to decide the fate of the known world.

56
00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:21.343
It was the day Alexander
had waited for all his life.

57
00:08:22.845 --> 00:08:25.013
Son of a god.

58
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.266
It was a myth, of course.

59
00:08:28.434 --> 00:08:31.228
At least it started as a myth.

60
00:08:31.854 --> 00:08:33.313
I know.

61
00:08:34.315 --> 00:08:35.899
I was there.

62
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.237
In the crack of the Persian line,
we'll go for the head.

63
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.197
Kill Darius?

64
00:08:42.365 --> 00:08:45.534
The gods have brought him
to us at last.

65
00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:48.787
If l die, it's one Macedonian.

66
00:08:48.955 --> 00:08:52.708
But the Persians, they cannot move
without Darius' command.

67
00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:57.212
Here. Right here, we cut the throat
of the Persian army.

68
00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.674
This is madness. You'll never get
within 1 00 paces of him.

69
00:09:00.842 --> 00:09:02.843
Have you seen the sheer size
of his force?

70
00:09:03.011 --> 00:09:07.514
Not if you hold them on the left,
my brave Parmenion...

71
00:09:07.682 --> 00:09:12.102
...with your son Philotas
for just one, two hours tomorrow.

72
00:09:13.438 --> 00:09:18.316
And you, unbreakable Antigonus,
the center phalanx.

73
00:09:18.484 --> 00:09:22.612
Perdiccas, Leonnatus...

74
00:09:22.864 --> 00:09:26.700
...Nearchus, Polyperchon.

75
00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:30.996
If you pin them on the walls
of your sarissas, here in the center...

76
00:09:31.164 --> 00:09:34.124
...their cavalry will follow me
out to the right.

77
00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:37.794
And when bold Cassander breaks,
stretching their left...

78
00:09:37.962 --> 00:09:40.839
...a hole will open.
Then l and my cavalry--

79
00:09:41.007 --> 00:09:43.383
Our revered Cleitus...

80
00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:46.803
...Ptolemy and Hephaistion.

81
00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:49.014
--will strike through that gap...

82
00:09:49.766 --> 00:09:52.559
...and deal the deathblow
to Darius' head.

83
00:09:52.727 --> 00:09:57.230
Since when, by the light of Apollo, has
cavalry been used to break an infantry line?

84
00:09:57.398 --> 00:09:59.399
What was it we did to
Chaeronea, Parmenion?

85
00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:03.403
Alexander, even with luck, timing, the gods,
they're at least five to our one...

86
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:07.657
...which means in truth we must rout them
tomorrow, destroy their army completely.

87
00:10:07.825 --> 00:10:11.369
Or we'll be picked apart by bandit tribes
on the long journey home.

88
00:10:11.537 --> 00:10:13.580
Right.

89
00:10:13.873 --> 00:10:18.168
You speak of home and retreat...

90
00:10:18.461 --> 00:10:21.171
...but do you understand, Parmenion?

91
00:10:22.673 --> 00:10:24.966
Babylon's my new home.

92
00:10:27.845 --> 00:10:29.554
Alexander...

93
00:10:29.722 --> 00:10:31.973
...if we must fight...

94
00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:33.934
...do so with stealth.

95
00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:39.064
Use your numbers well. We should attack
tonight when they least expect us.

96
00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:52.744
I didn't cross Asia
to steal this victory, Cassander.

97
00:10:52.912 --> 00:10:56.623
No, you are too honorable for that.

98
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.418
No doubt influenced from sleeping
with Tales of Troy under your pillow.

99
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.298
But your father
was no lover of Homer's.

100
00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:09.469
The lands west of the Euphrates, Alexander,
the hand of his daughter in marriage.

101
00:11:09.637 --> 00:11:11.721
Since when has a Greek
been given such honors?

102
00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:16.059
There are not honors, Parmenion,
they're bribes...

103
00:11:16.227 --> 00:11:19.020
...which the Greeks
have accepted too long.

104
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.568
Do you forget that
the man who murdered my father...

105
00:11:24.735 --> 00:11:27.279
-...lies across the valley floor?
-Come, Alexander...

106
00:11:27.446 --> 00:11:31.283
...we're still not really sure if it was
Persian gold behind the assassination.

107
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.493
But that is no matter!

108
00:11:33.661 --> 00:11:37.664
Your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion.

109
00:11:37.832 --> 00:11:39.666
Now I urge you...

110
00:11:39.834 --> 00:11:42.878
...with all my experience, regroup.

111
00:11:43.045 --> 00:11:45.213
Fall back to the coast,
raise a larger force.

112
00:11:46.674 --> 00:11:50.010
I would, if l were Parmenion.

113
00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:53.346
But l am Alexander.

114
00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:57.267
And no more than Earth has two suns
will Asia bear two kings.

115
00:11:57.894 --> 00:11:59.436
These are my terms.

116
00:11:59.604 --> 00:12:04.149
And if Darius isn't a coward
who hides behind his men...

117
00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:06.443
...then he'll come to me tomorrow.

118
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:10.697
And when he bows down to Greece...

119
00:12:11.824 --> 00:12:14.409
...Alexander will be merciful.

120
00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:24.836
By Ares' chains, he has got balls, men.

121
00:12:25.004 --> 00:12:27.839
I mean, give the man his due,
Parmenion.

122
00:12:29.217 --> 00:12:35.388
And, lads, feast tonight,
for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.

123
00:12:45.483 --> 00:12:48.568
I've seen one before.
It was still alive.

124
00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:05.502
To whom do you pray?

125
00:13:08.005 --> 00:13:09.589
Phobos.

126
00:13:11.092 --> 00:13:12.425
Fear?

127
00:13:15.888 --> 00:13:17.514
A bad omen.

128
00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:21.893
More so for Darius.

129
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.446
I've come to believe the fear of death
drives all men, Hephaistion.

130
00:13:33.614 --> 00:13:36.241
And this we didn't learn as schoolboys.

131
00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:40.412
It is the cause of all of our misfortunes.

132
00:13:40.997 --> 00:13:43.290
-So, mighty Crateros.
-Your Majesty.

133
00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.419
-Are you ready for tomorrow?
-lt's been too long coming if you ask me.

134
00:13:47.586 --> 00:13:51.965
The men are skittish as colts and
the damn bulls won't shut their snouts.

135
00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:55.635
Good. Fear makes men fight better.

136
00:13:56.721 --> 00:13:58.805
Post your sentries alertly
but rest them well.

137
00:13:58.973 --> 00:14:03.268
Don't you worry, general. I'm known to
sleep with my eyes open as a baby's arse.

138
00:14:03.436 --> 00:14:06.521
Only because someone
might steal his loot, sire.

139
00:14:07.315 --> 00:14:09.816
Well, someone owes Crateros
for his cheapness.

140
00:14:09.984 --> 00:14:13.236
He buys neither gloves nor blankets
to warm himself.

141
00:14:13.404 --> 00:14:16.156
Who needs gloves
when you come from grace?

142
00:14:16.574 --> 00:14:19.159
Who needs clothes
when you can fight naked?

143
00:14:19.827 --> 00:14:20.994
He's right.

144
00:14:21.162 --> 00:14:24.039
After tomorrow, even the thrifty
among you shall be kings.

145
00:14:24.206 --> 00:14:27.334
-The gods are with us, Your Majesty.
-We'll stain the ground...

146
00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:29.502
...in Persian blood, my king.

147
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:33.131
You're on the first row tomorrow, boy.

148
00:14:34.967 --> 00:14:38.303
I've always believed, Alexander...

149
00:14:38.721 --> 00:14:41.681
...but this seems so much bigger than us.

150
00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:46.519
Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when they
stood side by side at the seat of Troy?

151
00:14:46.771 --> 00:14:48.521
Patroclus died first.

152
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.358
If you do....

153
00:14:52.276 --> 00:14:55.904
If you were to fall, Hephaistion,
even if Macedonia were to lose a king...

154
00:14:56.864 --> 00:14:58.823
...l will avenge you.

155
00:14:59.575 --> 00:15:01.868
And follow you down
to the house of death.

156
00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:05.205
I would do the same.

157
00:15:14.757 --> 00:15:19.010
On the eve of battle,
it's hardest to be alone.

158
00:15:23.516 --> 00:15:25.642
Then perhaps....

159
00:15:27.395 --> 00:15:30.355
Perhaps this is farewell then...

160
00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:33.566
...my Alexander.

161
00:15:34.026 --> 00:15:39.656
Fear not, Hephaistion.
We are at the beginning.

162
00:16:14.108 --> 00:16:18.278
Blood makes the world rise.

163
00:16:19.113 --> 00:16:22.615
Blood makes the rain fall.

164
00:16:25.453 --> 00:16:29.330
Blood makes the earth grow.

165
00:16:30.541 --> 00:16:36.796
And in blood, all men are born and die.

166
00:16:38.591 --> 00:16:44.304
Blood is the food of the gods below.

167
00:16:58.569 --> 00:17:02.238
Come, Bucephalus.
Today we ride to our destiny.

168
00:17:05.034 --> 00:17:08.828
Company, group! Regroup!

169
00:17:20.132 --> 00:17:23.176
Phalanx, turn right!

170
00:17:40.277 --> 00:17:44.989
Phalanx, attention!

171
00:18:06.387 --> 00:18:09.222
Neoptolemus.

172
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.267
I remember you the day
you took the siege tower at Tyre.

173
00:18:12.434 --> 00:18:15.728
You were a giant.
And today, how will you fight?

174
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.820
Dexippos, by Athena.

175
00:18:23.988 --> 00:18:28.157
How far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last Olympic Games?

176
00:18:28.325 --> 00:18:30.994
Will you match it with your spear?

177
00:18:35.499 --> 00:18:40.878
And Timander, son of Menander,
a great soldier to my father.

178
00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:45.758
I still mourn your brother, Addaios,
who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.

179
00:18:45.926 --> 00:18:49.554
What an honored family
you descend from, Timander.

180
00:18:49.722 --> 00:18:52.640
You fight for them today.

181
00:18:54.101 --> 00:19:00.106
You've all honored
your country and your ancestors.

182
00:19:00.274 --> 00:19:05.069
And now we come to this
most distant place in Asia...

183
00:19:05.404 --> 00:19:11.868
...where across from us, Darius
has at last gathered a vast army....

184
00:19:39.021 --> 00:19:40.688
But ask yourselves...

185
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:46.402
...who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins...

186
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.863
...to murder my father, our king...

187
00:19:49.031 --> 00:19:53.868
...in a most despicable
and cowardly manner?

188
00:19:54.036 --> 00:19:59.666
Who is this great king, Darius,
who enslaves his own men to fight?

189
00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:03.961
Who is this king but a king of air?

190
00:20:04.129 --> 00:20:07.340
These men do not fight for their homes.

191
00:20:07.508 --> 00:20:11.010
They fight because
this king tells them they must.

192
00:20:11.637 --> 00:20:15.181
And when they fight,
they will melt away like the air...

193
00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:18.393
...because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves.

194
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.814
But we are not here today as slaves.

195
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:25.191
We are here today...

196
00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:29.028
...as Macedonian freemen!

197
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:46.629
And though outnumbered...

198
00:20:47.756 --> 00:20:51.509
...l say to you who know
the price of tyranny...

199
00:20:52.886 --> 00:20:56.723
...who've carried the Persian yoke
too long...

200
00:20:57.725 --> 00:21:01.227
...you have a strength
born of your hearts...

201
00:21:02.813 --> 00:21:05.440
...and all their arms, their numbers...

202
00:21:05.607 --> 00:21:09.068
...their chariots and all their fine horses...

203
00:21:09.236 --> 00:21:12.071
...will mean nothing
in the hands of slaves.

204
00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:14.449
Some of you...

205
00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:18.536
...perhaps myself...

206
00:21:18.746 --> 00:21:23.583
...will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today.

207
00:21:24.376 --> 00:21:29.380
For l will be
in the very thick of battle with you.

208
00:21:31.175 --> 00:21:33.259
But remember this:

209
00:21:33.844 --> 00:21:38.139
The greatest honor
a man can ever achieve...

210
00:21:38.307 --> 00:21:43.561
...is to live with great courage
and to die with his countrymen...

211
00:21:44.313 --> 00:21:46.564
...in battle for his home.

212
00:21:52.821 --> 00:21:54.781
I say to you...

213
00:21:55.532 --> 00:21:59.452
...what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time.

214
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.996
Conquer your fear...

215
00:22:02.164 --> 00:22:05.625
...and l promise you,
you will conquer death.

216
00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:33.402
And someday l vow to you...

217
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:39.367
...your sons and your grandsons
will look into your eyes.

218
00:22:40.118 --> 00:22:44.121
And when they ask why you
fought so bravely at Gaugamela...

219
00:22:44.998 --> 00:22:46.833
...you will answer...

220
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.879
...with all the strength
of your great, great hearts:

221
00:22:52.047 --> 00:22:55.007
"I was here this day at Gaugamela...

222
00:22:56.844 --> 00:22:59.262
...for the freedom...

223
00:23:00.389 --> 00:23:03.516
...and glory...

224
00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:07.812
...of Greece!"

225
00:23:14.361 --> 00:23:17.029
Zeus be with us!

226
00:23:44.016 --> 00:23:47.602
Cassander! Four columns, go!

227
00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:55.026
Where does he go?

228
00:23:55.193 --> 00:23:57.528
I don't know, Majesty.

229
00:23:57.696 --> 00:24:00.531
Envelop him, Bessus.

230
00:24:04.244 --> 00:24:07.330
Hephaistion, go!

231
00:24:16.715 --> 00:24:18.591
Phalanx!

232
00:24:37.027 --> 00:24:40.363
He makes a mistake, Pharnakes.

233
00:24:43.492 --> 00:24:45.076
Yes, great king.

234
00:25:47.597 --> 00:25:50.182
Be brave, men.

235
00:25:51.184 --> 00:25:52.768
Steady on the left, lads!

236
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.855
Bend if you must, but never break.

237
00:25:56.023 --> 00:25:59.025
And keep watching the cavalry on the left.

238
00:26:31.725 --> 00:26:33.893
Pick up the pace!

239
00:26:43.695 --> 00:26:47.406
Prepare to repel chariots!

240
00:27:24.444 --> 00:27:26.278
Forward!

241
00:28:16.079 --> 00:28:18.164
Cassander!

242
00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:20.666
-Forward, men!
-Forward!

243
00:28:31.553 --> 00:28:35.681
-Left turn!
-lnfantry, clear! Out now!

244
00:29:45.001 --> 00:29:49.672
Hold your positions!

245
00:30:18.285 --> 00:30:20.661
Father! We must
fall back to the gully, Father.

246
00:30:20.829 --> 00:30:22.371
No, hold.

247
00:30:22.539 --> 00:30:26.458
Where is he? We're far too thin!
Get word to Alexander!

248
00:30:26.626 --> 00:30:29.003
-Move!
-Yes, sir.

249
00:30:47.564 --> 00:30:51.108
Come, Macedonians! Ride! Ride!

250
00:30:58.033 --> 00:31:00.451
Drive for the hole!

251
00:31:00.952 --> 00:31:03.996
-Drive for the hole!
-Drive for the hole!

252
00:31:37.572 --> 00:31:40.783
Prince Merdicus, bring these men up.

253
00:32:06.393 --> 00:32:09.436
Back and to the left!
Back and to the left!

254
00:32:09.604 --> 00:32:12.731
-General!
-Get to your home! And go home fast.

255
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.609
I cannot see!

256
00:32:15.777 --> 00:32:18.779
-Philotas! Philotas!
-Father.

257
00:32:18.947 --> 00:32:21.031
Go. Tell Alexander yourself.

258
00:32:21.199 --> 00:32:25.744
And if he won't listen, then survive me
and avenge this betrayal!

259
00:33:06.911 --> 00:33:11.498
Pay attention, lad!
Your father still watches over you!

260
00:33:56.419 --> 00:33:59.046
Darius!

261
00:33:59.339 --> 00:34:01.423
Find your horses.

262
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:19.650
Darius!

263
00:34:40.713 --> 00:34:43.298
Go! Go!

264
00:35:00.108 --> 00:35:04.528
We can reach those mountains by sunset,
go all night and catch Darius at dawn.

265
00:35:04.696 --> 00:35:07.573
Provision the horses.

266
00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:11.952
Alexander!
Alexander, my father's lost.

267
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.913
They've overrun the flank.
They're into the baggage train.

268
00:35:15.081 --> 00:35:17.249
Parmenion's crumbling.

269
00:35:17.542 --> 00:35:22.004
Alexander, if you chase him,
you risk losing your army here.

270
00:35:22.171 --> 00:35:24.423
And if we capture him,
we gain an empire.

271
00:35:34.601 --> 00:35:37.269
You can run to the ends of the earth,
you coward...

272
00:35:37.437 --> 00:35:40.355
...but you'll never run far enough!

273
00:35:40.523 --> 00:35:43.233
To Parmenion!

274
00:36:13.848 --> 00:36:15.265
You bleed free, my lord.

275
00:36:15.433 --> 00:36:18.685
-May I tend to your wound?
-No, Hermolaus, not now.

276
00:36:18.853 --> 00:36:21.313
There's far worse than me. Go to them.

277
00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:23.315
Help them.

278
00:36:46.798 --> 00:36:49.007
How was this done, soldier?

279
00:36:50.093 --> 00:36:52.219
Spear.

280
00:36:53.346 --> 00:36:55.639
But l got two of the buggers.

281
00:36:58.851 --> 00:37:00.519
Your Majesty.

282
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:03.730
You're very brave.

283
00:37:05.108 --> 00:37:06.900
What shall I call you?

284
00:37:07.068 --> 00:37:09.945
-Glaukos, my king.
-Glaukos.

285
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.865
-And where's your home?
-lllyria.

286
00:37:16.327 --> 00:37:18.954
Let your body go loose.

287
00:37:22.417 --> 00:37:24.418
Think of home now.

288
00:37:24.585 --> 00:37:27.045
Be brave again, Glaukos...

289
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:31.133
...and you will live on in glory.

290
00:37:34.303 --> 00:37:36.388
Alexander.

291
00:37:46.232 --> 00:37:50.485
The Persian Empire,
the greatest the world had yet known...

292
00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:52.863
...was destroyed.

293
00:37:57.326 --> 00:38:02.164
And Alexander, at 25,
was now king of all.

294
00:38:16.262 --> 00:38:20.390
If you hesitate, she will strike.

295
00:38:22.977 --> 00:38:25.103
Yes.

296
00:38:26.773 --> 00:38:28.648
They are like people.

297
00:38:29.609 --> 00:38:35.864
You can love them for years.
Feed them, nurture them...

298
00:38:36.866 --> 00:38:41.453
...but still, they can turn on you.

299
00:38:49.003 --> 00:38:51.421
Don't hurt her.

300
00:38:52.965 --> 00:38:54.758
Good.

301
00:38:57.178 --> 00:38:58.637
Come.

302
00:39:04.894 --> 00:39:06.812
He calls me a barbarian.

303
00:39:06.979 --> 00:39:09.606
He makes a mockery
of Dionysus every night.

304
00:39:24.956 --> 00:39:29.209
Some called his mother,
Queen Olympias, a sorceress...

305
00:39:29.377 --> 00:39:32.838
...and said that Alexander
was the child of Zeus.

306
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:36.466
Others, Dionysus.

307
00:39:36.926 --> 00:39:43.181
Women are the only ones
who know Dionysus.

308
00:39:53.693 --> 00:39:57.362
But truly, there was not a man
in Macedonia who didn't look...

309
00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:02.868
...at father and son, side by side,
and wonder.

310
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.300
My little Achilles.

311
00:40:39.697 --> 00:40:42.824
Stay, Alexander, down. Down.

312
00:40:44.327 --> 00:40:46.286
What is it you want?

313
00:40:46.454 --> 00:40:48.330
Six months. Did you miss me?

314
00:40:48.497 --> 00:40:52.042
-No. Not here!
-Proud bitch. I'm still your king.

315
00:40:52.209 --> 00:40:55.378
King of what? Sheepherders?

316
00:41:00.301 --> 00:41:04.930
-l am of Achilles' royal blood.
-The blood of Herakles runs in my veins.

317
00:41:05.097 --> 00:41:07.766
-You are nothing but a drunken whore.
-Shut your mouth.

318
00:41:07.934 --> 00:41:09.559
You 1 0-titted bitch from Hades!

319
00:41:09.727 --> 00:41:12.729
Which god could l curse to
have ever laid eyes on you!

320
00:41:14.482 --> 00:41:17.108
Do you think people respect you?

321
00:41:17.276 --> 00:41:20.028
You think they don't know your bastards?

322
00:41:28.621 --> 00:41:31.790
Damn your sorceress soul! You keep him
here like one of your snakes!

323
00:41:31.958 --> 00:41:35.210
I told you not! I told you not.

324
00:41:35.378 --> 00:41:38.129
-You'll obey me.
-l will not.

325
00:41:38.297 --> 00:41:42.634
You'll obey me, or l'll kill you
with my own hands.

326
00:41:45.721 --> 00:41:50.308
Let her go! No! Stop! Papa!

327
00:41:51.978 --> 00:41:55.480
-Obey me!
-Your Majesty! No!

328
00:41:57.233 --> 00:41:59.067
In the name of the gods.

329
00:41:59.235 --> 00:42:04.447
He will never be yours! Never!

330
00:42:04.615 --> 00:42:09.285
In my womb, l carried my avenger!

331
00:42:18.671 --> 00:42:22.007
In the world he grew up to...

332
00:42:22.174 --> 00:42:27.095
...I've come to believe it was in
friendship that Alexander found his sanity.

333
00:42:27.263 --> 00:42:30.682
You don't need much to fight.

334
00:42:31.183 --> 00:42:37.147
When you're in the front ranks of a battle,
facing some Northern barbarian tribe...

335
00:42:37.314 --> 00:42:42.193
...courage won't be in
the soles of your feet, Perdiccas.

336
00:42:42.361 --> 00:42:45.196
Or in the thickness
of your tunic, Philotas.

337
00:42:45.364 --> 00:42:48.158
Or in the lining
of your stomach, Nearchus.

338
00:42:48.325 --> 00:42:52.704
It's in the heart of a man.

339
00:42:53.247 --> 00:42:57.917
You don't need to eat every day
or until you're full, Ptolemy.

340
00:42:58.085 --> 00:43:01.046
You don't need to lie in bed
in a morning...

341
00:43:01.213 --> 00:43:05.425
...when you can have some good bean soup,
Cassander, after a forced night march.

342
00:43:06.218 --> 00:43:08.053
Come on, Alexander.

343
00:43:08.929 --> 00:43:12.891
Where's your hunger
to twist Hephaistion's head off?

344
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.352
Is he stronger than you?
Then beat him another way.

345
00:43:19.065 --> 00:43:22.067
Who will respect you as a king?
You think because of your father?

346
00:43:22.234 --> 00:43:28.364
The first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do. No more, no less.

347
00:43:31.869 --> 00:43:33.495
Good, Hephaistion. That's it.

348
00:43:33.746 --> 00:43:38.208
Well done. Good wrestling, Hephaistion.
That's what l want.

349
00:43:38.375 --> 00:43:39.751
Come, come, come.

350
00:43:40.211 --> 00:43:41.836
You did well, but you lost.

351
00:43:42.004 --> 00:43:47.383
Now, both of you, congratulate
the other. Go on.

352
00:43:47.968 --> 00:43:50.637
Would you want me to let you win,
Alexander?

353
00:43:52.723 --> 00:43:54.933
You're right.

354
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:58.186
But l promise you, l will beat
you one day, Hephaistion.

355
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:09.447
It was said later that Alexander
was never defeated...

356
00:44:09.615 --> 00:44:11.533
...except by Hephaistion's thighs.

357
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.244
Although an inferior race...

358
00:44:14.411 --> 00:44:19.833
...the Persians control at least
four-fifths of the known world.

359
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.502
From Ethiopia and Egypt in the south...

360
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.213
...to Caucasus and the two inland seas
in the north....

361
00:44:25.381 --> 00:44:29.884
Philip brought such as Aristotle from
Athens to educate our rough people.

362
00:44:30.094 --> 00:44:34.639
They rule, and we sit around like frogs.

363
00:44:34.807 --> 00:44:36.015
-Master?
-Yes?

364
00:44:36.183 --> 00:44:37.475
-Master!
-Out with it!

365
00:44:37.643 --> 00:44:40.478
-Why are the Persians so cruel?
-Oh, come on, Nearchus.

366
00:44:40.646 --> 00:44:42.647
That is not the subject for today,
Nearchus.

367
00:44:42.815 --> 00:44:47.819
But it is true that the Oriental races
are known for their barbarity...

368
00:44:47.987 --> 00:44:50.280
...and their slavish devotion
to their senses.

369
00:44:50.447 --> 00:44:54.534
Which are so dull,
they castrate young boys...

370
00:44:54.702 --> 00:44:57.495
...such as yourselves,
for their sexual pleasure.

371
00:44:58.664 --> 00:45:03.668
Yes. Excess in all things
is the undoing of men.

372
00:45:03.836 --> 00:45:05.795
That is why we Greeks are superior.

373
00:45:05.963 --> 00:45:09.174
We practice control of our senses.

374
00:45:09.341 --> 00:45:11.593
Moderation, we hope.

375
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.678
Then what of Achilles at Troy, master?

376
00:45:15.347 --> 00:45:20.310
-Was he not excessive?
-Achilles simply lacks restraint.

377
00:45:20.477 --> 00:45:24.230
He dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle...

378
00:45:24.398 --> 00:45:27.692
...crazed with grief over
his dead lover, Patroclus...

379
00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.947
...he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man.

380
00:45:33.115 --> 00:45:37.035
Would you say the love between Achilles
and Patroclus is a corrupting one?

381
00:45:38.204 --> 00:45:41.706
When men lie together in lust,
it is a surrender to the passions...

382
00:45:41.874 --> 00:45:45.627
...and does nothing
for the excellence in us.

383
00:45:45.794 --> 00:45:50.298
Nor does any other excess, Cassander,
jealousy among them.

384
00:45:50.883 --> 00:45:55.845
But when men lie together, and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them...

385
00:45:56.013 --> 00:45:59.599
...that is pure and excellent.

386
00:45:59.767 --> 00:46:03.978
When they compete to bring out the good,
the best in each other...

387
00:46:04.146 --> 00:46:08.066
...this is the love between men that
can build a city-state...

388
00:46:08.234 --> 00:46:10.735
...and lift us from our frog pond.

389
00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:15.907
But can a man
love a woman equally, master?

390
00:46:16.116 --> 00:46:17.742
A woman? Of course not.

391
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.536
A woman is a slave
to her passion, Hephaistion.

392
00:46:20.704 --> 00:46:23.873
Oh, naturally there are exceptions,
and we must honor them.

393
00:46:24.041 --> 00:46:28.086
Such as Pallas Athena,
goddess of wisdom and war.

394
00:46:28.254 --> 00:46:32.590
But never forget, she is sprung not from
the loins of Zeus, but from his mind.

395
00:46:33.259 --> 00:46:36.386
Now, you think on all this,
my young frogs...

396
00:46:36.553 --> 00:46:41.266
...for in you resides
the future of Greek civilization.

397
00:46:41.433 --> 00:46:45.770
To strive for honor
is the highest purpose of all.

398
00:46:45.938 --> 00:46:48.439
To rule over our baser emotions.

399
00:46:48.607 --> 00:46:52.443
To follow reason,
the divine part in each of you.

400
00:46:52.611 --> 00:46:53.945
Yes...

401
00:46:54.154 --> 00:46:58.408
...to love excellence
is truly to love the gods.

402
00:47:00.619 --> 00:47:02.245
Now, will you stop distracting me?

403
00:47:02.621 --> 00:47:05.290
Back to geography
and things that we know.

404
00:47:05.457 --> 00:47:11.045
Is it possible that the source
of Egypt's mighty River Nile...

405
00:47:11.213 --> 00:47:14.882
...could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth?

406
00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:21.055
If so, an experienced navigator
could find his way here...

407
00:47:21.223 --> 00:47:25.977
...by this river east, down
into the great plains of lndia...

408
00:47:26.145 --> 00:47:30.732
...out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world...

409
00:47:30.899 --> 00:47:34.819
...and by this route up the Nile...

410
00:47:34.987 --> 00:47:41.075
...back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea
and home to Greece.

411
00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.829
Now, if only these frogs
could look outward...

412
00:47:44.997 --> 00:47:49.000
...and act on their favored position
at the center...

413
00:47:49.168 --> 00:47:51.252
...Greece could rule the world.

414
00:47:51.503 --> 00:47:57.008
Why is it, master, in myth,
these lands you speak of are known?

415
00:47:58.761 --> 00:48:03.514
India, where Herakles
and Dionysus traveled.

416
00:48:03.682 --> 00:48:09.187
All these men who went east,
Theseus, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.

417
00:48:09.355 --> 00:48:13.274
From generation to generation,
their stories have been passed on.

418
00:48:13.442 --> 00:48:15.985
Why? Unless there was truth to them?

419
00:48:16.153 --> 00:48:21.783
Tales of Amazons? Minotaurs, Gorgons,
Icarus flying into the sun? No, Alexander.

420
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:25.787
Only common people believe these tales,
as they believe most anything.

421
00:48:25.954 --> 00:48:30.541
We are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions.

422
00:48:31.001 --> 00:48:35.838
But if we are superior to the Persians,
as you say, why do we not rule them?

423
00:48:36.006 --> 00:48:40.968
It is-- lt has always been
our Greek dream to go east.

424
00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.846
My father long wants it.

425
00:48:44.598 --> 00:48:49.811
The East has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams.

426
00:48:49.978 --> 00:48:56.025
But still, to think it's these myths
that lead us forward to the greatest glory...

427
00:48:56.235 --> 00:48:58.569
...why is it wrong to act on them?

428
00:48:59.571 --> 00:49:02.365
I can only warn you, not teach you.

429
00:49:03.325 --> 00:49:06.619
Beware of what you dream for.

430
00:49:07.371 --> 00:49:11.082
The gods have a way
of punishing such pride.

431
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:25.721
And growing more ambitious, Philip now
planned the invasion of Persia.

432
00:49:32.062 --> 00:49:36.315
The best you can do, Cleitus? Back
to the phalanx with you, l'll ride him myself.

433
00:49:36.483 --> 00:49:38.860
No one will ride that beast, Your Majesty.

434
00:49:39.445 --> 00:49:41.028
Not with your leg.

435
00:49:42.364 --> 00:49:44.115
He's been beaten far too often.

436
00:49:45.409 --> 00:49:47.952
My noble king,
he's a high-spirited animal, yes.

437
00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.956
High-spirited and worthy
of Philip of Macedon.

438
00:49:52.124 --> 00:49:54.292
For three and a half talents...

439
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:57.128
...l couldn't make a profit
on him, but for you--

440
00:49:57.296 --> 00:50:00.047
Why would l want such a beast?
I already have a wife.

441
00:50:02.176 --> 00:50:03.634
Do I seem so old?

442
00:50:09.975 --> 00:50:12.810
Stay down, stay down.

443
00:50:19.485 --> 00:50:20.943
Hold him. Hold him!

444
00:50:27.493 --> 00:50:31.787
A broken neck comes free. He's
too nervous for battle. Sell him for meat.

445
00:50:31.955 --> 00:50:35.333
Buy him for me, Father. I'll ride him.

446
00:50:39.963 --> 00:50:41.339
And if you don't?

447
00:50:41.507 --> 00:50:45.134
-l'll pay for him myself.
-With what, your singing voice?

448
00:50:45.302 --> 00:50:47.094
I'll pay you!

449
00:50:47.262 --> 00:50:50.681
I tell you, that horse can't be ridden,
lad. His mind is broken.

450
00:50:53.602 --> 00:50:56.604
He can be ridden. By me.

451
00:50:56.772 --> 00:50:59.524
If you can rule that horse,
I'll make him yours...

452
00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:01.692
...at half the price.

453
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.903
That horse will kill him, Philip.

454
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:06.364
-He'll break the boy in two.
-Will he?

455
00:51:06.532 --> 00:51:09.367
Perhaps she'll make
a musician out of him yet.

456
00:51:24.716 --> 00:51:27.802
You don't like your shadow, do you?

457
00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:32.014
It's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

458
00:51:32.182 --> 00:51:36.060
Do you see? That's us.

459
00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.939
It's just a trick of Apollo's.

460
00:51:40.107 --> 00:51:44.569
He's the god of the sun.

461
00:51:47.906 --> 00:51:52.159
But l'll show you how to outwit him,
you and me together.

462
00:52:02.379 --> 00:52:05.464
The boy doesn't have the craft, Philip.
He could hurt himself.

463
00:52:05.632 --> 00:52:10.052
He'll have to figure that out
for himself. It's time.

464
00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.054
Good idea.

465
00:52:12.306 --> 00:52:15.474
Indeed there are times, Philip,
when l wonder if he is your blood.

466
00:52:15.642 --> 00:52:18.269
-l only worry that--
-What was that, Attalus?

467
00:52:18.437 --> 00:52:19.729
Nothing.

468
00:52:19.896 --> 00:52:24.859
I was just noticing how the people
like seeing you and Eurydice together.

469
00:52:28.822 --> 00:52:29.989
You go, boy!

470
00:52:30.949 --> 00:52:35.369
You ride that horse and by Zeus l say,
you can rule the world.

471
00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:01.687
Bucephalus.

472
00:53:01.855 --> 00:53:05.816
That's what l'll call you.
Strong and stubborn.

473
00:53:08.654 --> 00:53:11.739
Bucephalus and Alexander.

474
00:53:13.158 --> 00:53:16.869
Come now, let's ride together.

475
00:53:49.695 --> 00:53:51.445
He's got some Titan in him yet.

476
00:53:51.613 --> 00:53:56.242
Attalus! Cleitus! For Zeus' sake,
he beat you, man!

477
00:54:01.289 --> 00:54:04.625
Now, Bucephalus, show them.

478
00:54:37.534 --> 00:54:38.868
My son.

479
00:54:39.035 --> 00:54:40.745
My son!

480
00:54:52.174 --> 00:54:54.216
You remember Prometheus...

481
00:54:54.384 --> 00:54:58.262
...who stole the secret of fire
and gave it to man.

482
00:54:58.430 --> 00:55:01.098
It made Zeus so angry...

483
00:55:01.433 --> 00:55:04.477
...he chained Prometheus
to a rock in the great Caucasus...

484
00:55:04.644 --> 00:55:08.522
...and each day, his eagle pecked out
the poor man's liver.

485
00:55:09.107 --> 00:55:13.819
Each night, it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day.

486
00:55:13.987 --> 00:55:15.237
Miserable fate.

487
00:55:17.783 --> 00:55:22.703
Oedipus tore out his eyes
when he found out...

488
00:55:22.871 --> 00:55:25.122
...he'd murdered his father...

489
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:29.794
...and married his mother.
Knowledge that came too late.

490
00:55:30.629 --> 00:55:32.046
Jason...

491
00:55:33.507 --> 00:55:36.258
...he went east and brought back
the Golden Fleece...

492
00:55:36.426 --> 00:55:39.637
...and married a barbarian wife, Medea.

493
00:55:39.805 --> 00:55:44.266
Later, when he left her
for a younger wife...

494
00:55:44.434 --> 00:55:48.395
...Medea slaughtered
their two children in vengeance.

495
00:56:00.617 --> 00:56:03.369
My mother would never hurt me.

496
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:13.712
It's never easy to escape our mothers,
Alexander.

497
00:56:14.297 --> 00:56:20.803
All your life, beware of women.
They're far more dangerous than men.

498
00:56:28.353 --> 00:56:31.647
I'm sure you remember Achilles
from Tales of Troy.

499
00:56:31.815 --> 00:56:34.316
-He's my favorite.
-Why?

500
00:56:34.943 --> 00:56:38.737
Because he loved Patroclus
and avenged his death.

501
00:56:39.114 --> 00:56:42.533
Because he lived without fear,
and slew Hector.

502
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:44.368
Some say he was a hotheaded fool...

503
00:56:44.536 --> 00:56:46.620
...who fought for himself
and not the Greeks.

504
00:56:46.788 --> 00:56:50.374
But he was a hero, the greatest at Troy.

505
00:56:50.542 --> 00:56:51.750
And his fate?

506
00:56:51.918 --> 00:56:55.796
That he must die young
but with great glory.

507
00:56:55.964 --> 00:56:58.007
Did he have a choice?

508
00:56:58.425 --> 00:57:04.430
Oh, yes. He could have a long life,
but there would be no glory.

509
00:57:07.392 --> 00:57:11.729
You dream of glory, Alexander.
Your mother encourages you.

510
00:57:11.897 --> 00:57:15.524
There's no glory without suffering,
and this she will not allow.

511
00:57:15.692 --> 00:57:17.860
She makes you weak.

512
00:57:19.195 --> 00:57:21.530
The gods have never
made it easy for man.

513
00:57:21.698 --> 00:57:25.326
Look, Herakles.

514
00:57:27.037 --> 00:57:30.748
Even after he accomplished
his 1 2 labors...

515
00:57:32.292 --> 00:57:37.838
...he was punished with madness,
slaughtered his three children.

516
00:57:38.673 --> 00:57:40.591
Poor Herakles.

517
00:57:42.677 --> 00:57:44.428
Great Herakles.

518
00:57:44.596 --> 00:57:46.889
All greatness comes from loss.

519
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:53.520
Even you, the gods will
one day judge harshly.

520
00:57:53.688 --> 00:57:55.689
When I'm king like you, Father?

521
00:57:55.857 --> 00:57:59.652
Don't rush the day, boy. You risk all.

522
00:58:00.695 --> 00:58:04.782
My father threw me into battle
before l knew how to fight.

523
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:07.493
When I killed my first man, he said:

524
00:58:07.661 --> 00:58:09.912
"Now you know."

525
00:58:10.538 --> 00:58:14.625
I hated him then,
but I understand why now.

526
00:58:14.793 --> 00:58:17.086
A king isn't born, Alexander.

527
00:58:17.253 --> 00:58:21.298
He's made by steel and by suffering.

528
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.512
A king must know
how to hurt those he loves.

529
00:58:30.308 --> 00:58:32.810
It's lonely. Ask Herakles.

530
00:58:33.812 --> 00:58:37.481
Ask any of them. Fate is cruel.

531
00:58:38.483 --> 00:58:44.196
No man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling.

532
00:58:44.364 --> 00:58:50.828
They laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything you've built with a whim.

533
00:58:51.454 --> 00:58:55.499
What glory they give,
in the end, they take away.

534
00:58:56.501 --> 00:59:00.087
They make of us slaves.

535
00:59:15.854 --> 00:59:20.065
Truth is in our hearts,
and none will tell you this but your father.

536
00:59:20.692 --> 00:59:23.694
Men hate the gods.

537
00:59:24.654 --> 00:59:29.241
The only reason we worship any of them
is because we fear worse.

538
00:59:30.076 --> 00:59:31.785
What's worse?

539
00:59:31.953 --> 00:59:33.829
The Titans.

540
00:59:33.997 --> 00:59:36.707
If they were ever to be set free...

541
00:59:36.875 --> 00:59:39.877
...it would be a darkness
such as we have never seen before.

542
00:59:40.045 --> 00:59:42.254
Could they ever come back?

543
00:59:43.465 --> 00:59:46.550
Can Zeus imprison the Titans forever
under Mount Olympus?

544
00:59:46.718 --> 00:59:52.139
It's said that when Zeus burned them
to dust with his lightning bolt...

545
00:59:52.307 --> 00:59:55.059
...they took the Titans' ashes
and, in a cold revenge...

546
00:59:55.226 --> 00:59:57.770
...mixed it with those of mortal men.

547
00:59:57.937 --> 00:59:59.480
Why?

548
01:00:03.735 --> 01:00:05.861
Who knows these things?

549
01:00:06.613 --> 01:00:09.406
One day, things will change.

550
01:00:10.742 --> 01:00:12.701
Men will change.

551
01:00:12.869 --> 01:00:16.080
But first, the gods must change.

552
01:00:21.836 --> 01:00:24.838
But all this you'll forget, Alexander.

553
01:00:25.757 --> 01:00:28.008
That's why we call them myths.

554
01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.428
We can't bear to remember them.

555
01:00:31.805 --> 01:00:33.263
I'll remember.

556
01:00:33.765 --> 01:00:36.934
And one day, l'll be on walls like these.

557
01:00:44.943 --> 01:00:47.152
Alexander once said to me:

558
01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.782
"We are most alone
when we are with the myths."

559
01:00:52.784 --> 01:00:53.951
Phalanx!

560
01:00:55.703 --> 01:00:58.080
And thus, it came to pass in a dream...

561
01:00:58.248 --> 01:01:02.292
...as mythical to all Greeks
as Achilles defeating the Trojans.

562
01:01:03.044 --> 01:01:06.213
At this one glorious moment in time...

563
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:10.634
...Alexander was loved by all.

564
01:01:12.679 --> 01:01:17.266
But in the end, I believe Babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter...

565
01:01:17.433 --> 01:01:20.227
...than she was to leave.

566
01:02:11.196 --> 01:02:14.865
Sikander! Sikander!

567
01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:44.311
Aristotle may have called them barbarians,
but he never saw Babylon.

568
01:02:44.479 --> 01:02:49.149
We have enough gold here to support
three generations of Macedonian armies.

569
01:02:49.317 --> 01:02:52.277
And Macedonia would soon corrupt,
Cassander.

570
01:02:52.445 --> 01:02:57.115
-Wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
-Not for the men who fought, l trust.

571
01:02:58.034 --> 01:03:02.120
We'll pay them well, Antigonus,
but not as mercenaries for future services.

572
01:03:02.288 --> 01:03:04.248
Now you sound like Philip.

573
01:03:05.124 --> 01:03:06.750
Philip never saw Babylon.

574
01:03:07.543 --> 01:03:09.419
No, he didn't, Hephaistion.

575
01:03:11.256 --> 01:03:13.257
-Hello!
-Hello!

576
01:03:13.675 --> 01:03:17.094
Alexander, I know you think me
a stiff old sod...

577
01:03:17.262 --> 01:03:19.763
...but whatever our differences,
know this day...

578
01:03:19.931 --> 01:03:23.475
...your father would be very proud of you.

579
01:03:25.395 --> 01:03:26.979
Thank you, Parmenion.

580
01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:32.276
I ask you to forgive me
my own anger, my pride.

581
01:03:32.443 --> 01:03:34.569
They, too, blind me.

582
01:03:38.283 --> 01:03:41.618
A magnificent mainland work
from the last century.

583
01:03:42.078 --> 01:03:47.624
The golden age, Alexander. Worth much
to Athens and to our alliances.

584
01:03:47.792 --> 01:03:49.960
Take back what is ours...

585
01:03:50.169 --> 01:03:52.629
...but spare what belongs to the Persians.

586
01:03:56.175 --> 01:04:02.055
Yes. We're the richest men
to walk the earth, my friends.

587
01:04:02.223 --> 01:04:06.935
-Not if you keep giving it all away.
-The grandsons of goat herders...

588
01:04:07.103 --> 01:04:10.689
...we now rule 2 million square miles.

589
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:13.692
But....

590
01:04:14.527 --> 01:04:19.948
None of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction.

591
01:04:20.366 --> 01:04:22.159
You overvalue us.

592
01:04:22.327 --> 01:04:25.996
For as long as Darius breathes,
he is the legitimate king of Asia...

593
01:04:26.164 --> 01:04:28.498
...and l but the king of air.

594
01:04:28.666 --> 01:04:33.754
But he has no power, Alexander.
He's lost in the mountains with no army.

595
01:04:33.921 --> 01:04:37.341
As long as he's lost, Philotas,
he can be believed in.

596
01:04:37.508 --> 01:04:40.802
Only when he's found will it be decided.

597
01:04:42.513 --> 01:04:44.598
It seems you've already
made up your mind.

598
01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:47.684
We must finish what we failed
to do at Gaugamela.

599
01:04:47.852 --> 01:04:49.728
We must hunt Darius down.

600
01:04:49.896 --> 01:04:53.357
-That was not your father's mission.
-And I am not my father.

601
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:58.528
Come on. Have you so quickly forgotten?

602
01:04:58.696 --> 01:04:59.738
Fortune favors the bold.

603
01:05:04.535 --> 01:05:07.537
No wonder Darius fled
when he had this to come back to.

604
01:05:07.705 --> 01:05:11.291
One for every night of the year.

605
01:05:37.068 --> 01:05:39.569
How will l go back to Lysimache
after this?

606
01:05:39.737 --> 01:05:43.657
I advise you not to touch, Leonnatus.
Here, l'll take care of it for you.

607
01:06:02.802 --> 01:06:04.928
Aristotle was perhaps prescient.

608
01:06:08.641 --> 01:06:12.436
Do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls?

609
01:06:42.884 --> 01:06:46.386
Bagoas, great king. Darius' boy.

610
01:06:46.554 --> 01:06:51.600
-Bagoas.
-Nicely gilded, Your Majesty.

611
01:06:51.767 --> 01:06:57.147
Most successful. He was certainly
one of the great king's favorites.

612
01:06:59.108 --> 01:07:02.944
How old? ls great well with the years.

613
01:07:04.989 --> 01:07:08.950
What are you now, Bagoas?
Eighteen, 1 9?

614
01:07:09.118 --> 01:07:12.329
-Where does he come from?
-The north, sire.

615
01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.249
From the hills near Susa.

616
01:07:16.417 --> 01:07:18.460
You speak our language.

617
01:07:18.628 --> 01:07:22.255
-Good. l'd like to learn yours.
-ls learnable, my lord.

618
01:07:35.686 --> 01:07:37.020
So tell me, Bagoas...

619
01:07:38.231 --> 01:07:41.525
...do my eyes betray me
or do you wish to be set free...

620
01:07:41.692 --> 01:07:43.401
...to go back to your homeland?

621
01:07:47.532 --> 01:07:50.325
All my family's long dead, great king.

622
01:07:50.618 --> 01:07:54.204
With your permission, l will stay on.

623
01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:58.959
Very well then, Bagoas.

624
01:08:00.127 --> 01:08:02.879
Ptolemy, administer this.

625
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:09.386
And that's the same of every person
in the harem, woman and eunuch.

626
01:08:09.554 --> 01:08:12.931
Whoever wishes to be sent home
to their families, let them.

627
01:08:13.266 --> 01:08:14.349
What?

628
01:08:14.517 --> 01:08:17.978
Hear that, boys? Set them free!

629
01:08:51.596 --> 01:08:55.265
Great King Alexander.

630
01:08:57.768 --> 01:09:00.353
The princess of the thousand roses...

631
01:09:00.521 --> 01:09:03.273
...and eldest daughter of the formerly
Great King Darius...

632
01:09:04.609 --> 01:09:06.651
...Stateira.

633
01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:08.862
Noble Alexander...

634
01:09:15.995 --> 01:09:18.955
...l come to beg for the lives...

635
01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.041
...of my sisters...

636
01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:24.961
...my mother, my grandmother.

637
01:09:29.592 --> 01:09:33.678
You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.

638
01:09:33.846 --> 01:09:35.972
He, too, is Alexander.

639
01:09:39.810 --> 01:09:41.019
Please.

640
01:09:42.146 --> 01:09:45.732
I plead for my family's lives.

641
01:09:47.068 --> 01:09:50.153
-Sell me as a slave, great king, but--
-Look now...

642
01:09:50.321 --> 01:09:52.489
...in my eyes...

643
01:09:53.616 --> 01:09:54.824
...princess...

644
01:09:56.827 --> 01:09:58.536
...and tell me...

645
01:09:58.704 --> 01:10:01.164
...how would you like to be treated?

646
01:10:03.668 --> 01:10:05.794
As l am...

647
01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:08.004
...a princess.

648
01:10:11.258 --> 01:10:13.009
Then so be it.

649
01:10:14.762 --> 01:10:17.806
You and your family shall
be treated as my family.

650
01:10:20.476 --> 01:10:23.645
You shall live in this palace
as long as you choose.

651
01:10:24.021 --> 01:10:27.691
Have you any other requests for me,
my noble princess?

652
01:10:30.236 --> 01:10:31.861
No.

653
01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:35.865
Everything I wish...

654
01:10:36.033 --> 01:10:38.952
...l have requested.

655
01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:41.705
You truly are...

656
01:10:41.872 --> 01:10:43.206
...a queen.

657
01:10:50.131 --> 01:10:52.882
Yes, she would be
a рerfect match for you...

658
01:10:53.551 --> 01:10:55.427
...but you do nothing.

659
01:10:55.845 --> 01:10:59.222
Three months you've been in Babylon
and leave me in Pella...

660
01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:03.226
...at the mercy of your enemies,
of which you have many.

661
01:11:03.394 --> 01:11:07.063
Antipater, accustomed now to the power
that you have given him.

662
01:11:07.314 --> 01:11:09.858
I must watch him grow stronger.

663
01:11:17.074 --> 01:11:22.078
I'm certain that he communicates secretly
with Parmenion, who is dangerous.

664
01:11:22.246 --> 01:11:25.248
But beware, most of all,
of those closest to you.

665
01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:26.916
They are like snakes...

666
01:11:28.002 --> 01:11:29.419
...and can be turned.

667
01:11:29.587 --> 01:11:31.212
General Crateros.

668
01:11:34.175 --> 01:11:37.802
Cassander is Antipater's son.

669
01:11:38.804 --> 01:11:42.599
Even Cleitus, your father's favorite...

670
01:11:42.767 --> 01:11:45.226
...and Ptolemy, your friend, yes.

671
01:11:45.394 --> 01:11:47.604
But beware of men who think too much.

672
01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.106
They blind themselves.

673
01:11:53.778 --> 01:11:56.112
Only Hephaistion do l leave out.

674
01:11:57.198 --> 01:11:59.783
But all of them you make rich...

675
01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:05.789
...while your mother and yourself,
you leave in generous рoverty.

676
01:12:06.624 --> 01:12:09.626
Why won't you ever believe me?

677
01:12:09.794 --> 01:12:15.465
It is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart.

678
01:12:15.633 --> 01:12:18.468
For they are dark, Alexander.

679
01:12:18.677 --> 01:12:21.054
So dark.

680
01:12:21.222 --> 01:12:27.811
But in you, the son of Zeus,
lies the light of the world.

681
01:12:27.978 --> 01:12:31.981
Your companions will be shadows
in the underworld...

682
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:36.486
...when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious...

683
01:12:36.654 --> 01:12:41.115
...shining light of youth, forever young,
forever inspiring.

684
01:12:41.283 --> 01:12:44.828
Never will there be an Alexander like you.

685
01:12:44.995 --> 01:12:47.747
Alexander the Great.

686
01:12:48.749 --> 01:12:52.293
Remember, bring me to Babylon
as you promised.

687
01:12:52.461 --> 01:12:55.672
I can only help you, for they know
if they harm you...

688
01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.967
...they will face my wrath,
as Queen of Babylon.

689
01:13:01.554 --> 01:13:05.223
It's a high ransom she charges
for nine months' lodging in the womb.

690
01:13:05.391 --> 01:13:07.392
Bring her, Alexander.

691
01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.520
-lt'll give her such joy.
-Joy?

692
01:13:11.438 --> 01:13:14.691
When I'm the cracked mirror
of her dreams?

693
01:13:17.194 --> 01:13:19.863
Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion.

694
01:13:26.412 --> 01:13:28.204
I'll take my own bath.

695
01:13:29.331 --> 01:13:30.832
Thank you, Bagoas.

696
01:13:39.174 --> 01:13:40.508
What bothers you?

697
01:13:42.511 --> 01:13:45.263
I see in her everything l fear.

698
01:13:46.891 --> 01:13:51.936
Yet l have no idea what it is, this fear.

699
01:13:56.650 --> 01:14:00.236
She was always so sure
I was born of Zeus.

700
01:14:00.779 --> 01:14:02.906
Why, Hephaistion?

701
01:14:04.575 --> 01:14:09.579
I think there are things
beyond our imagining...

702
01:14:10.331 --> 01:14:15.376
...like the lightning,
tales of strange conceptions.

703
01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:18.755
I don't doubt it.

704
01:14:19.048 --> 01:14:21.257
What is being told me?

705
01:14:21.717 --> 01:14:25.345
What destiny do we--? Do l have?

706
01:14:27.389 --> 01:14:32.477
Well, if I'm Patroclus, I die first.

707
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:34.687
Then you, Achilles.

708
01:14:41.445 --> 01:14:44.280
The generals are upset.

709
01:14:45.532 --> 01:14:48.868
They question your obsession
with Darius.

710
01:14:49.036 --> 01:14:52.205
They say it was never meant
for you to be king of Asia.

711
01:14:52.373 --> 01:14:53.915
Naturally.

712
01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:58.419
They want only to return to their homes,
rich with gold. But I've seen the future.

713
01:14:58.587 --> 01:15:01.881
I've seen it now 1 000 times,
on 1 000 faces.

714
01:15:02.049 --> 01:15:04.175
These people want....

715
01:15:04.969 --> 01:15:07.220
Need change.

716
01:15:08.097 --> 01:15:12.600
-Aristotle was wrong about them.
-How so?

717
01:15:12.893 --> 01:15:14.894
Look at those we've conquered.

718
01:15:15.062 --> 01:15:17.146
They leave their dead unburied.

719
01:15:17.314 --> 01:15:20.024
They smash their enemies' skulls
and drink them as dust.

720
01:15:20.192 --> 01:15:22.485
They mate in public.

721
01:15:22.653 --> 01:15:27.490
What can they think or sing or write
when none can read?

722
01:15:27.658 --> 01:15:32.328
But as Alexander's army, they can go
where they never thought possible.

723
01:15:32.496 --> 01:15:35.540
They can soldier or work in the cities.

724
01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:39.919
The Alexandrias,
from Egypt to the outer ocean.

725
01:15:40.421 --> 01:15:43.339
We could connect these lands,
Hephaistion...

726
01:15:43.507 --> 01:15:44.716
...and the people.

727
01:15:44.883 --> 01:15:50.346
Some say these Alexandrias have become
extensions of Alexander himself.

728
01:15:51.265 --> 01:15:54.392
They draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them.

729
01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.938
But we freed them, Hephaistion, from
the Persia where everyone lived as slaves.

730
01:16:00.858 --> 01:16:04.110
To free the people of the world...

731
01:16:04.278 --> 01:16:08.865
...such would be beyond the glory
of Achilles, beyond Herakles...

732
01:16:09.033 --> 01:16:11.701
...a feat to rival Prometheus...

733
01:16:12.494 --> 01:16:15.163
...who was always a friend to man.

734
01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:17.707
Remember the fates of these heroes.

735
01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:22.045
-They suffered greatly.
-We all suffer.

736
01:16:22.504 --> 01:16:26.049
Your father, mine.

737
01:16:26.884 --> 01:16:28.926
They all came to the end of their time.

738
01:16:29.094 --> 01:16:33.181
And in the end, when it's over,
all that matters is what you've done.

739
01:16:34.475 --> 01:16:39.270
You once said,
"The fear of death drives all men."

740
01:16:39.605 --> 01:16:41.564
Are there no other forces?

741
01:16:42.691 --> 01:16:45.568
Is there not love in your life...

742
01:16:46.987 --> 01:16:48.988
...Alexander?

743
01:16:52.743 --> 01:16:57.205
What would you do if you
ever reached the end of the world?

744
01:16:59.083 --> 01:17:02.251
I'd turn back and conquer its opposite.

745
01:17:07.257 --> 01:17:12.470
I wonder sometimes if it's not
your mother you run from.

746
01:17:13.764 --> 01:17:17.225
So many years,
so many miles between you.

747
01:17:19.353 --> 01:17:21.354
What is it you fear?

748
01:17:22.773 --> 01:17:25.108
Who knows these things?

749
01:17:26.735 --> 01:17:31.823
When I was a child, my mother thought
me divine. My father, weak.

750
01:17:34.409 --> 01:17:36.994
Which am l, Hephaistion?

751
01:17:37.162 --> 01:17:39.288
Weak or divine?

752
01:17:42.793 --> 01:17:44.710
All I know is...

753
01:17:44.878 --> 01:17:47.839
...l trust only you in this world.

754
01:17:48.006 --> 01:17:49.966
I've missed you.

755
01:17:50.759 --> 01:17:52.093
I need you.

756
01:17:54.138 --> 01:17:55.805
It is you l love, Hephaistion.

757
01:17:58.183 --> 01:18:00.351
No other.

758
01:18:04.148 --> 01:18:07.024
You're everything l care for...

759
01:18:07.192 --> 01:18:10.862
...and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite...

760
01:18:11.363 --> 01:18:14.490
...l'm so jealous of losing you
to this world you want.

761
01:18:14.992 --> 01:18:17.618
You'll never lose me, Hephaistion.

762
01:18:17.995 --> 01:18:21.289
I'll be with you always.

763
01:18:21.957 --> 01:18:24.000
Till the end.

764
01:18:37.264 --> 01:18:39.891
The campaign in the northeast of Persia...

765
01:18:40.058 --> 01:18:45.188
...turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years.

766
01:18:47.774 --> 01:18:50.443
We chased Darius towards Bactria...

767
01:18:50.611 --> 01:18:53.404
...but missed taking him by hours.

768
01:18:56.658 --> 01:18:59.035
He was dying when we found him, sire.

769
01:18:59.203 --> 01:19:01.078
He asked for water.

770
01:19:01.246 --> 01:19:03.623
He drank and died.

771
01:19:10.297 --> 01:19:15.009
The Great King Darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders.

772
01:19:43.121 --> 01:19:45.081
Fully honoring his corpse...

773
01:19:45.249 --> 01:19:50.169
...Alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands...

774
01:19:51.129 --> 01:19:55.967
...crossing even beyond
the River Oxus into Sogdia.

775
01:20:00.138 --> 01:20:04.267
We fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of Scythia...

776
01:20:05.269 --> 01:20:08.562
...where only legendary heroes
had once trod.

777
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:14.068
The surveyors told us we were now on
the borders of where Europe and Asia meet.

778
01:20:14.236 --> 01:20:17.488
In fact, we were totally lost.

779
01:20:18.991 --> 01:20:21.993
Here, Alexander founded
his 1 0th Alexandria...

780
01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:27.456
...and settled it with veterans, their women
and any who would dare the frontier life.

781
01:20:28.458 --> 01:20:31.460
Unable to accept defeat in any form...

782
01:20:31.628 --> 01:20:35.965
...Alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted...

783
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:40.136
...until the day he received the head
of his last enemy who'd surrendered.

784
01:20:45.017 --> 01:20:49.645
For Alexander, there could be
no pretender to the throne of Asia...

785
01:20:50.772 --> 01:20:55.151
...which now included all
of Sogdia and Bactria.

786
01:20:58.238 --> 01:21:02.491
It was here that he made
one of his most mysterious decisions.

787
01:21:05.454 --> 01:21:09.832
Ten years after his mother's insistence
he marry a Macedonian...

788
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.001
Through our union...

789
01:21:12.169 --> 01:21:15.004
...Greek and barbarian...

790
01:21:15.172 --> 01:21:17.131
...may be reconciled in peace.

791
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:23.012
...the most рowerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance.

792
01:21:28.018 --> 01:21:29.602
Why?

793
01:21:30.729 --> 01:21:34.148
Some say it was for
alliance with the tribes.

794
01:21:35.942 --> 01:21:38.194
Others, the desire for a successor.

795
01:21:40.697 --> 01:21:45.743
And yet others said
Alexander truly fell in love.

796
01:21:46.995 --> 01:21:48.871
Who Roxane really was...

797
01:21:49.039 --> 01:21:54.835
...I doubt that any of us ever saw further
than the pools of those black eyes.

798
01:21:56.463 --> 01:21:59.173
On this glorious occasion...

799
01:22:00.801 --> 01:22:03.677
...l toast this great army
that has given so much.

800
01:22:03.845 --> 01:22:07.932
And in honor of them, those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago...

801
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:14.355
...l pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury.

802
01:22:14.731 --> 01:22:15.981
Praise Alexander!

803
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:22.154
And in honor of my bride...

804
01:22:25.742 --> 01:22:28.244
...my beautiful bride...

805
01:22:28.412 --> 01:22:32.915
...we recognize the many women
who've shared the long road with us...

806
01:22:33.083 --> 01:22:36.585
...and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage.

807
01:22:45.262 --> 01:22:48.055
And what about our boys?

808
01:22:48.223 --> 01:22:49.723
And lastly...

809
01:22:49.891 --> 01:22:53.144
...lastly, the gods demand no less of us...

810
01:22:53.311 --> 01:22:56.647
...that your children be given
a proper Greek education...

811
01:22:56.815 --> 01:23:01.444
...and military training
under our protection...

812
01:23:01.611 --> 01:23:05.823
...so as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom...

813
01:23:05.991 --> 01:23:08.451
...in Asia.

814
01:23:24.301 --> 01:23:29.805
Your father must be turning in his grave.
After all this time, a hill chief's daughter.

815
01:23:30.056 --> 01:23:31.849
You call this
tribal wedding legitimate?

816
01:23:32.017 --> 01:23:34.810
Do you forget my father
took a barbarian as his queen?

817
01:23:34.978 --> 01:23:37.813
Yes, but few would call it
a profoundly happy marriage.

818
01:23:39.065 --> 01:23:42.234
But what's the point, Alexander?
She's your captive.

819
01:23:42.402 --> 01:23:44.278
Just take her as your concubine.

820
01:23:44.446 --> 01:23:47.281
Because I want a son.
Damn you, Philotas.

821
01:23:47.824 --> 01:23:53.245
Then half your nobles have sisters
who'd make fine Macedonian mothers.

822
01:23:53.413 --> 01:23:56.165
To take an Asian as my queen,
not a captive...

823
01:23:56.333 --> 01:23:58.167
...is a sign of respect
for our subjects.

824
01:23:58.376 --> 01:24:00.669
It will bring us together, unify us.

825
01:24:01.213 --> 01:24:03.339
Which is not to say I won't take
a Macedonian.

826
01:24:03.507 --> 01:24:06.800
As a second wife? You insult Macedonia.

827
01:24:07.552 --> 01:24:11.514
Never will our people
accept this girl's son as king.

828
01:24:11.848 --> 01:24:16.018
They'll be angry enough to find out their
husbands all have second wives in Barbaria.

829
01:24:16.186 --> 01:24:17.520
Then they'll learn!

830
01:24:17.687 --> 01:24:20.940
By Athena's justice, this girl has spirit.

831
01:24:21.107 --> 01:24:23.359
She'll breed a brave son.

832
01:24:23.527 --> 01:24:25.319
Alexander!

833
01:24:25.862 --> 01:24:28.531
This is about the honor of our kingdom.

834
01:24:28.698 --> 01:24:30.866
Exactly. What can be won, Alexander?

835
01:24:31.034 --> 01:24:34.537
We're in Asia to punish them
for their crimes. We've achieved that.

836
01:24:34.704 --> 01:24:38.332
Seven years from home, now we drift
from one far region to another...

837
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.127
...chasing nomads and bandits
when Macedonia bleeds its manpower.

838
01:24:42.295 --> 01:24:45.214
For what? To build roads in Asia?

839
01:24:45.382 --> 01:24:48.884
-To give these people cities?
-And now make an army of them?

840
01:24:49.052 --> 01:24:52.388
To found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift.

841
01:24:52.556 --> 01:24:54.974
-What benefit to Macedon?
-lt's far richer!

842
01:24:55.141 --> 01:24:57.393
-Look what you give them.
-With respect...

843
01:24:57.561 --> 01:25:01.230
...had you fought better at Gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling--

844
01:25:01.398 --> 01:25:04.733
-How dare you, Nearchus?!
-General Nearchus to you, boy.

845
01:25:04.901 --> 01:25:08.404
Alexander spread our flank too thin!
There was nothing my father...

846
01:25:08.572 --> 01:25:10.906
-...or any of you could've done!
-Philotas!

847
01:25:16.913 --> 01:25:19.540
Alexander, I've known you
since you were born.

848
01:25:20.208 --> 01:25:23.210
I supported you at your father's death.

849
01:25:23.378 --> 01:25:26.255
At the very least, for Zeus' sake...

850
01:25:26.423 --> 01:25:29.383
...and in respect to the council
that chose you king...

851
01:25:29.551 --> 01:25:31.677
...give us a Macedonian heir.

852
01:25:31.845 --> 01:25:33.554
A Macedonian heir.

853
01:25:39.894 --> 01:25:41.937
-You've been heard clearly.
-But--

854
01:25:42.105 --> 01:25:47.651
Parmenion! After the wedding, take two
brigades to Babylon, where l look to you...

855
01:25:47.819 --> 01:25:52.656
...and Antipater in Greece, to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition.

856
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:55.534
I'll winter with my army at Marakand.

857
01:25:55.702 --> 01:25:59.788
I pray to Apollo you realize how far
you've turned from your father's path.

858
01:25:59.956 --> 01:26:02.625
Damn you, Parmenion,
by the gods and your Apollo.

859
01:26:02.792 --> 01:26:05.961
What was in my father's guts
wasn't overripe in reason like yours!

860
01:26:06.129 --> 01:26:10.090
He never lusted for war, Alexander,
or enjoyed it so.

861
01:26:10.258 --> 01:26:15.512
He consulted his peers in council,
among equals, the Macedonian way.

862
01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.223
He didn't decide based
on his personal desires.

863
01:26:18.391 --> 01:26:21.810
I've taken us further
than my father ever dreamed.

864
01:26:21.978 --> 01:26:23.270
Old man...

865
01:26:23.438 --> 01:26:25.814
...we're in new worlds.

866
01:26:26.816 --> 01:26:30.486
Alexander, be reasonable!

867
01:26:30.654 --> 01:26:33.072
Were they ever meant to be our equals?

868
01:26:33.365 --> 01:26:35.115
Share our rewards?

869
01:26:35.283 --> 01:26:37.409
You remember what Aristotle said.

870
01:26:37.577 --> 01:26:38.911
An Asian?

871
01:26:39.079 --> 01:26:42.873
What would a vow mean to a race
that's never kept their word to a Greek?

872
01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:45.125
-Aristotle be damned!
-Alexander!

873
01:26:45.293 --> 01:26:46.794
By Zeus and all the gods...

874
01:26:46.961 --> 01:26:51.090
...what makes you so much better
than them, Cassander?

875
01:26:51.257 --> 01:26:55.803
Better than you really are.
In you and those like you is this.

876
01:26:57.097 --> 01:26:58.931
Alexander.

877
01:27:01.601 --> 01:27:06.313
What disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment.

878
01:27:09.359 --> 01:27:13.112
It's your contempt for a world
far older than ours.

879
01:27:45.729 --> 01:27:48.397
Five to any man
who bothers to kill me.

880
01:27:48.565 --> 01:27:50.941
Have another drink, Cleitus.

881
01:27:51.568 --> 01:27:54.737
-Shouldn't you be bound to a king?
-Cleitus.

882
01:27:55.405 --> 01:27:59.658
Alexander, you look weak
when you not accept these honors.

883
01:27:59.826 --> 01:28:01.910
I understand, my dear father...

884
01:28:02.078 --> 01:28:05.789
-...but it's against Greek ways.
-Then Greek ways are weak.

885
01:28:05.957 --> 01:28:08.625
I still think she got the better of him
in this bargain.

886
01:28:08.793 --> 01:28:12.004
My daughter, Roxane...

887
01:28:12.172 --> 01:28:14.256
...she shall make you good wife.

888
01:28:14.424 --> 01:28:16.800
She shall kill for you.

889
01:28:20.972 --> 01:28:26.351
Lord Sikander, ruler of heaven...

890
01:28:27.937 --> 01:28:29.605
...and earth.

891
01:28:35.528 --> 01:28:38.906
In honor of this great alliance...

892
01:28:39.073 --> 01:28:44.328
...l, Oxyartes, offer you these great gifts.

893
01:28:44.496 --> 01:28:47.414
I would like to honor a toast
to you from my people.

894
01:28:53.463 --> 01:28:55.005
Good morning, sire.

895
01:29:15.568 --> 01:29:17.820
We shall fight for you, Alexander.

896
01:29:18.655 --> 01:29:20.823
It shall be bloody.

897
01:29:22.659 --> 01:29:24.576
Who's the bear?

898
01:29:26.246 --> 01:29:27.955
Parmenion.

899
01:29:28.456 --> 01:29:31.333
You've been in complete control
of your supply lines.

900
01:29:31.501 --> 01:29:33.794
His pessimism is infectious.

901
01:29:34.212 --> 01:29:36.171
But he'll stay loyal...

902
01:29:37.924 --> 01:29:40.175
...as long as his son remains with us.

903
01:31:56.938 --> 01:31:58.230
Hey!

904
01:32:06.114 --> 01:32:10.409
Her eyes tell me
she cares for you, Alexander.

905
01:32:12.662 --> 01:32:13.996
Perhaps too much.

906
01:32:18.334 --> 01:32:20.669
In the ways of my country...

907
01:32:21.045 --> 01:32:24.840
...those who love too much
lose everything...

908
01:32:25.883 --> 01:32:28.677
...and those who love with irony...

909
01:32:30.221 --> 01:32:31.346
...last.

910
01:33:22.690 --> 01:33:24.149
I found it in Egypt.

911
01:33:26.819 --> 01:33:29.237
The man who sold it said it came
from a time...

912
01:33:29.405 --> 01:33:33.283
...when man worshipped sun and stars.

913
01:33:39.123 --> 01:33:41.416
I'll always think of you...

914
01:33:42.168 --> 01:33:44.503
...as the sun, Alexander.

915
01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:48.715
And l pray your dream
will shine on all men.

916
01:33:57.642 --> 01:33:59.768
I wish you a son.

917
01:34:01.604 --> 01:34:03.980
You're a great man.

918
01:34:08.111 --> 01:34:11.363
Many will love you, Alexander,
but none so pure and deep....

919
01:34:28.256 --> 01:34:29.673
You...

920
01:34:29.841 --> 01:34:31.299
...love him?

921
01:34:40.434 --> 01:34:43.478
He is Hephaistion.

922
01:35:03.082 --> 01:35:05.000
Thank you, Bagoas.

923
01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.507
Your boy?

924
01:35:12.675 --> 01:35:16.178
There are many different ways
to love, Roxane.

925
01:35:16.721 --> 01:35:18.221
Come.

926
01:35:33.321 --> 01:35:34.571
No.

927
01:35:34.739 --> 01:35:36.156
No, no.

928
01:35:52.048 --> 01:35:53.882
No. No.

929
01:36:26.457 --> 01:36:28.416
You have no fear.

930
01:36:30.086 --> 01:36:31.878
It's fitting.

931
01:36:33.130 --> 01:36:36.591
A man searches for a woman
at Earth's top...

932
01:36:36.759 --> 01:36:38.760
...and finds her.

933
01:36:56.112 --> 01:36:57.779
The myth becomes real.

934
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.919
Great man, Sikander...

935
01:37:13.254 --> 01:37:14.713
...you I kill now.

936
01:37:20.469 --> 01:37:21.970
Do it.

937
01:37:22.513 --> 01:37:25.056
End it. I would do the--

938
01:37:25.641 --> 01:37:29.686
I would do the same.
I'll die a fool...

939
01:37:29.854 --> 01:37:33.315
...for this love.

940
01:38:20.696 --> 01:38:22.614
My life is now yours.

941
01:38:47.431 --> 01:38:50.683
You will have my son.

942
01:39:45.739 --> 01:39:52.287
Who is this woman you call your queen,
Alexander? A hill girl?

943
01:39:53.122 --> 01:39:55.582
You with your breeding.

944
01:39:55.749 --> 01:40:00.795
Already she makes enemies
with her strong, clumsy nature.

945
01:40:04.133 --> 01:40:06.468
Do not confuse us.

946
01:40:06.635 --> 01:40:10.430
I was never a barbarian as Philip said.

947
01:40:10.598 --> 01:40:13.266
We are of Achilles' royal blood.

948
01:40:14.185 --> 01:40:17.228
Zeus is your father.

949
01:40:18.814 --> 01:40:23.234
Oh, l understand she brings
you some happiness...

950
01:40:23.986 --> 01:40:26.321
...but how can she help you?

951
01:40:26.489 --> 01:40:29.491
You must know that
she does not speak in your name...

952
01:40:29.658 --> 01:40:33.661
...which is yours and yours alone.

953
01:40:33.829 --> 01:40:36.873
Preserve it, secret it...

954
01:40:37.041 --> 01:40:40.168
...and hear me when l tell you,
act...

955
01:40:40.336 --> 01:40:42.253
...and act soon.

956
01:40:42.421 --> 01:40:44.422
After seven years, people wonder:

957
01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:46.883
"Who is this King Alexander?"

958
01:40:47.051 --> 01:40:52.847
I have given you ample proof.
Antipater daily undermines your authority.

959
01:40:53.015 --> 01:40:56.017
Return to Babylon
and strengthen your center.

960
01:40:56.936 --> 01:40:59.020
Or come home to Macedonia
and reorganize.

961
01:40:59.188 --> 01:41:01.773
But do not chase your dream...

962
01:41:01.941 --> 01:41:04.025
...further east.

963
01:41:04.193 --> 01:41:07.987
Your life and mine depend on it.

964
01:41:08.864 --> 01:41:10.532
Remember...

965
01:41:10.699 --> 01:41:14.410
...my only thoughts are of you.

966
01:41:14.578 --> 01:41:18.873
As you, too, must face
your glorious destiny.

967
01:41:19.041 --> 01:41:21.167
Think kindly of your mother.

968
01:41:21.335 --> 01:41:22.877
Provide for me.

969
01:41:23.045 --> 01:41:26.673
Protect me from your enemies
when you are gone.

970
01:41:28.008 --> 01:41:30.760
And remember always...

971
01:41:30.928 --> 01:41:34.389
...it is l who love you more than any.

972
01:41:40.646 --> 01:41:43.982
If only you were not a pale reflection...

973
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:45.567
...of my mother's heart.

974
01:42:05.588 --> 01:42:09.090
Pregnant so soon. The little whore.

975
01:42:09.258 --> 01:42:13.428
He will marry her in the spring,
during Dionysus' Festival...

976
01:42:13.596 --> 01:42:16.222
...and when her first son is born...

977
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:21.894
...her sweet uncle Attalus will convince
Philip to name the boy his successor...

978
01:42:22.062 --> 01:42:24.480
...with himself as regent.

979
01:42:24.648 --> 01:42:26.608
And you...

980
01:42:26.775 --> 01:42:30.862
...you will be sent on
some impossible mission...

981
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:33.615
...against some monstrous Northern tribe...

982
01:42:33.782 --> 01:42:39.287
...to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle.

983
01:42:39.455 --> 01:42:43.291
And l, no longer queen,
will be put to death...

984
01:42:43.459 --> 01:42:47.545
...with your sister and the remaining
members of our family.

985
01:42:47.713 --> 01:42:52.467
I wish sometimes you could see
the light, Mother.

986
01:42:52.635 --> 01:42:57.388
The truth is, he's taken nothing from you
that you've not been long without.

987
01:42:58.932 --> 01:43:01.309
The only way is to strike.

988
01:43:01.477 --> 01:43:04.270
Announce your marriage
to a Macedonian now.

989
01:43:04.813 --> 01:43:09.108
Beget a child of pure blood. He would
be one of them, not mine...

990
01:43:09.276 --> 01:43:12.612
...and he would have no choice
but to make you king.

991
01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.989
There is still Kynnane.

992
01:43:16.742 --> 01:43:20.620
Eurydice was perfect. If your father,
that pig, had not ravaged her first!

993
01:43:20.788 --> 01:43:23.581
Say nothing more of my father.

994
01:43:23.749 --> 01:43:26.751
Do you hear me? Say nothing.

995
01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:29.337
You're right.

996
01:43:30.339 --> 01:43:32.423
Forgive me.

997
01:43:32.591 --> 01:43:35.426
A mother loves too much.

998
01:43:41.642 --> 01:43:44.268
Who shall l sing to sleep
at night anymore?

999
01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:54.362
I wish-- I wish we could spend
more time together.

1000
01:43:55.114 --> 01:43:59.575
Like we used to, when you were
the sweetest boy.

1001
01:44:04.873 --> 01:44:06.999
There's never been time, Mother.

1002
01:44:07.835 --> 01:44:12.714
Since I was a child, l've been groomed
to be ever the best.

1003
01:44:13.757 --> 01:44:18.219
My poor child, you're like Achilles...

1004
01:44:18.387 --> 01:44:20.888
...cursed by your greatness.

1005
01:44:25.352 --> 01:44:27.478
Yes. Take my strength.

1006
01:44:33.193 --> 01:44:37.488
You must never confuse your feelings...

1007
01:44:37.656 --> 01:44:40.742
...with your duties, Alexander.

1008
01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:45.663
A king must make public gestures
for the common people.

1009
01:44:45.831 --> 01:44:49.250
I know, but you will be 1 9 this summer...

1010
01:44:49.418 --> 01:44:54.172
...and the girls already say you don't
like them. You like Hephaistion more.

1011
01:44:54.339 --> 01:44:57.800
I understand.
It's natural for a young man.

1012
01:44:57.968 --> 01:45:02.180
But if you go to Asia without leaving
your successor, you risk all.

1013
01:45:02.347 --> 01:45:07.810
Hephaistion loves me,
as l am...

1014
01:45:08.771 --> 01:45:10.104
...not who.

1015
01:45:11.565 --> 01:45:15.067
Loves? Loves?

1016
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:19.614
In the name of Dionysus...

1017
01:45:20.949 --> 01:45:27.455
...understand how Philip thinks,
for your own sake.

1018
01:45:27.623 --> 01:45:31.542
Your life hangs in the balance.

1019
01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:37.799
I know these things, Alexander.
You are nothing to him.

1020
01:45:38.342 --> 01:45:42.637
His spies are inside your closest circle...

1021
01:45:43.013 --> 01:45:46.349
...to ensure that
you don't plot against him.

1022
01:45:46.517 --> 01:45:49.602
And still you sleep.

1023
01:45:51.146 --> 01:45:54.690
You will not live out this year
unless you act!

1024
01:45:54.858 --> 01:45:56.317
Stop!

1025
01:45:58.654 --> 01:46:01.405
I'm his only worthy son.

1026
01:46:01.573 --> 01:46:03.574
You crazed woman.

1027
01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:06.702
He'd never hurt me.

1028
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:12.583
Even if Eurydice had a boy,
he'd be 20 before he'd let him rule.

1029
01:46:12.751 --> 01:46:16.170
Yes, and you would be 40.

1030
01:46:16.338 --> 01:46:22.718
Old and wise like Parmenion.
And Philip's young son would be 20.

1031
01:46:22.886 --> 01:46:29.267
Like you now,
but raised by him, his blood.

1032
01:46:29.852 --> 01:46:33.229
He will never give you
the throne now, Alexander.

1033
01:46:33.397 --> 01:46:34.939
Never.

1034
01:46:37.192 --> 01:46:39.318
What would you have me do?

1035
01:46:40.153 --> 01:46:42.864
Whatever is necessary.

1036
01:46:46.243 --> 01:46:48.953
Where have you lost your mind?

1037
01:46:49.371 --> 01:46:51.789
It would be civil war,
clan against clan, chaos.

1038
01:46:51.957 --> 01:46:54.876
Yes. And you would win.

1039
01:46:55.043 --> 01:46:57.670
Because the young ones
love you like a god.

1040
01:46:57.838 --> 01:47:00.131
I forbid you to ever talk to me like that!

1041
01:47:00.674 --> 01:47:03.551
Such a man would be forever chased
by the Furies!

1042
01:47:03.719 --> 01:47:07.346
What have you to fear from the Furies...

1043
01:47:07.514 --> 01:47:10.683
...for killing an impostor to the throne...

1044
01:47:10.851 --> 01:47:14.395
...before he murders you
and your mother?

1045
01:47:14.563 --> 01:47:17.273
Why won't you ever believe me?

1046
01:47:17.441 --> 01:47:21.068
Philip did not want you.

1047
01:47:21.653 --> 01:47:23.571
You had a condition of the breathing...

1048
01:47:23.739 --> 01:47:26.157
...and he wanted to leave you
in the mountains...

1049
01:47:26.325 --> 01:47:29.452
...for the birds to peck at your eyes.

1050
01:47:30.746 --> 01:47:33.039
What you don't know, my poor child.

1051
01:47:33.206 --> 01:47:35.958
Lanice knows nothing of this.

1052
01:47:36.168 --> 01:47:37.418
Lanice.

1053
01:47:38.211 --> 01:47:40.755
I was there.

1054
01:47:40.923 --> 01:47:43.549
Lanice was not.

1055
01:47:43.926 --> 01:47:46.177
No, Alexander...

1056
01:47:46.345 --> 01:47:49.847
...Zeus is your father.

1057
01:47:50.515 --> 01:47:55.394
I laid with him that night in the wind,
as sure as any mortal man.

1058
01:47:55.562 --> 01:47:59.106
Never have I been made love to
as l was then.

1059
01:47:59.274 --> 01:48:00.691
Enough.

1060
01:48:01.526 --> 01:48:05.321
Half the mothers in Greece
share such a fantasy.

1061
01:48:05.906 --> 01:48:07.865
I warn you, Mother.

1062
01:48:08.033 --> 01:48:10.159
Make no mistake.

1063
01:48:11.119 --> 01:48:15.623
You will treat this girl as nothing
more important than his other wives.

1064
01:48:15.791 --> 01:48:19.293
You will behave as we always have.

1065
01:48:19.461 --> 01:48:21.170
As the first.

1066
01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:33.474
I wonder...

1067
01:48:34.810 --> 01:48:36.310
...did you ever love him?

1068
01:48:40.065 --> 01:48:41.649
What?

1069
01:48:44.027 --> 01:48:46.112
I never stopped.

1070
01:49:20.397 --> 01:49:22.273
What is it, Orestes?

1071
01:49:27.112 --> 01:49:29.196
I beg your forgiveness, my king.

1072
01:49:30.157 --> 01:49:32.366
I cannot be part of this.

1073
01:49:33.785 --> 01:49:35.703
Who did this?

1074
01:49:38.665 --> 01:49:40.249
Tell me.

1075
01:49:40.625 --> 01:49:42.668
-Say it!
-Hermolaus!

1076
01:49:54.347 --> 01:49:57.892
Death to all tyrants.

1077
01:50:00.395 --> 01:50:02.271
I didn't do this!

1078
01:50:02.898 --> 01:50:07.109
I've known you and loved you
as long as l know.

1079
01:50:08.236 --> 01:50:10.946
Never will you find a man
as devoted as l.

1080
01:50:11.114 --> 01:50:13.741
The consрiracy, such as it was...

1081
01:50:13.909 --> 01:50:16.327
...deeply upset Alexander.

1082
01:50:16.495 --> 01:50:20.414
Not only because it involved
the young people who shared his dream...

1083
01:50:20.582 --> 01:50:26.253
...but more intimately, it implicated
Philotas, his companion from boyhood...

1084
01:50:26.421 --> 01:50:31.425
...when a рage confessed that a few days
before, he'd informed Philotas...

1085
01:50:31.593 --> 01:50:33.511
-Alexander.
-...of the plot.

1086
01:50:35.347 --> 01:50:36.931
Remember me for who l am.

1087
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:43.729
I do remember you, Philotas,
but not as you remember yourself.

1088
01:50:44.356 --> 01:50:49.401
And it appears to me and others here
from the testimony given by your mistress...

1089
01:50:49.903 --> 01:50:53.405
...that the true weather of your soul
is ambition.

1090
01:50:54.449 --> 01:50:55.449
No.

1091
01:50:55.617 --> 01:50:59.328
We all felt there was more here
than sexual bickering.

1092
01:50:59.496 --> 01:51:04.125
Alexander wanted the truth and
Philotas' answers were lacking merit.

1093
01:51:04.459 --> 01:51:05.459
Please take him away.

1094
01:51:05.627 --> 01:51:09.880
Alexander put him silently and quickly
to trial by his peers...

1095
01:51:10.048 --> 01:51:14.051
...and whether plotter or opрortunist,
Philotas was found guilty of treason.

1096
01:51:14.219 --> 01:51:16.053
-No, Alexander, no!
-Remove him.

1097
01:51:16.221 --> 01:51:19.098
The suspects were all executed.

1098
01:51:19.266 --> 01:51:21.976
None of us defended Philotas...

1099
01:51:22.144 --> 01:51:25.521
...but then again,
none of us ever liked him.

1100
01:51:30.777 --> 01:51:35.239
And of course his power
was carved up by the rest of us.

1101
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:39.243
Before he died, we tortured him...

1102
01:51:39.411 --> 01:51:42.621
...to find out what
his father, Parmenion, knew.

1103
01:51:42.789 --> 01:51:44.999
But this we never learned.

1104
01:51:45.167 --> 01:51:49.128
What to do with Parmenion and his
20,000 troops guarding our supрly lines...

1105
01:51:49.296 --> 01:51:53.007
...was a far more delicate matter.
Was he innocent in this?

1106
01:51:53.175 --> 01:51:58.304
Or had he decided to act before
age further withered his power?

1107
01:51:58.471 --> 01:52:01.974
-The men will follow their king.
-Alexander won't be there.

1108
01:52:03.143 --> 01:52:06.562
Necessity required Alexander to act...

1109
01:52:06.730 --> 01:52:11.650
...and he sealed the camр within the hour
of the first accusations against Philotas.

1110
01:52:12.986 --> 01:52:16.947
Then go, Antigonus, and Cleitus.

1111
01:52:17.115 --> 01:52:18.949
And go quickly.

1112
01:52:21.953 --> 01:52:26.373
Three days' hard riding
sent Antigonus and Cleitus...

1113
01:52:26.541 --> 01:52:31.587
...to Parmenion, the general
most loyal to Philip.

1114
01:52:37.886 --> 01:52:41.388
His soldiers accepted the finding of guilt
against Parmenion...

1115
01:52:41.556 --> 01:52:44.058
...as they understood well
the code of vengeance...

1116
01:52:44.226 --> 01:52:49.104
...that made the head of family
responsible for the behavior of all.

1117
01:52:51.399 --> 01:52:55.611
Many of us felt we were better off
without that рompous thorn, Parmenion...

1118
01:52:55.779 --> 01:53:00.908
...as Alexander рromoted all of us
generously.

1119
01:53:15.757 --> 01:53:20.261
If we issue the gold bullion in the name
of Alexander then we meet a resistance.

1120
01:53:20.428 --> 01:53:22.680
Cleitus. Antigonus.

1121
01:53:22.847 --> 01:53:24.473
Parmenion.

1122
01:55:38.066 --> 01:55:41.318
Come, Alexander,
drink this sadness away.

1123
01:55:41.486 --> 01:55:43.904
If only thirst could quench sorrow,
Ptolemy.

1124
01:55:47.283 --> 01:55:51.578
There's only one thing better
than winning a battle, son...

1125
01:55:52.330 --> 01:55:55.207
...and that's the taste of a new woman.

1126
01:55:55.375 --> 01:56:00.212
You'll find it far sweeter than self-pity.

1127
01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:02.548
-Pausanias, you bore me.
-Alexander!

1128
01:56:02.715 --> 01:56:05.759
-Be gone with you.
-Alexander, I found you the right girl.

1129
01:56:05.927 --> 01:56:08.178
-What's your name, darling?
-Antigone.

1130
01:56:08.346 --> 01:56:10.305
-What's your name?
-Antigone.

1131
01:56:12.267 --> 01:56:15.436
-l love you.
-And I love you, Cleitus.

1132
01:56:16.271 --> 01:56:18.897
-Please, no!
-There you go.

1133
01:56:22.527 --> 01:56:24.862
I'll sleep in my grave, Hephaistion.

1134
01:56:25.029 --> 01:56:27.865
While alive, I prefer dancing.

1135
01:56:28.032 --> 01:56:29.575
Pausanias.

1136
01:56:30.618 --> 01:56:32.077
Who's your new friend?

1137
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:34.455
-There's your new friend.
-Please don't!

1138
01:56:34.622 --> 01:56:38.167
Don't! Please, no! No.

1139
01:56:47.427 --> 01:56:48.635
A toast.

1140
01:56:49.304 --> 01:56:50.721
A toast!

1141
01:56:51.264 --> 01:56:56.602
I drink to our Greek friends
and to our new union...

1142
01:56:56.769 --> 01:57:02.649
...Macedonia and Greece,
equals in greatness!

1143
01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:11.617
And to Philip, our king, without whom
this union could not be possible.

1144
01:57:11.784 --> 01:57:14.786
Come, Attalus, leave some
damn air in the hall!

1145
01:57:16.456 --> 01:57:22.211
And last, l drink to the king's marriage
to my niece, Eurydice...

1146
01:57:22.378 --> 01:57:25.506
...a Macedonian queen
we can be proud of!

1147
01:57:28.676 --> 01:57:31.762
To Philip and Eurydice...

1148
01:57:31.930 --> 01:57:35.182
...and to their legitimate sons!

1149
01:57:36.684 --> 01:57:38.393
Alexander, don't!

1150
01:57:38.561 --> 01:57:41.522
What am I, you son of a dog?
Come, then.

1151
01:57:52.534 --> 01:57:54.993
What a disgrace.

1152
01:57:55.161 --> 01:57:56.203
Shut up!

1153
01:57:56.996 --> 01:57:58.872
-Shut up, all of you!
-Please.

1154
01:57:59.374 --> 01:58:01.959
This is my wedding,
not some public brawl.

1155
01:58:02.126 --> 01:58:04.086
Insolent pup.

1156
01:58:04.254 --> 01:58:07.589
Apologize, by Zeus,
before you dishonor me.

1157
01:58:07.757 --> 01:58:10.926
You defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard.

1158
01:58:11.094 --> 01:58:14.471
-And I dishonor you?
-You listen like your mother.

1159
01:58:14.639 --> 01:58:16.682
Attalus is my family now,
the same as you.

1160
01:58:16.849 --> 01:58:19.560
Then choose your relatives
more carefully.

1161
01:58:19.727 --> 01:58:22.980
Don't expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself.

1162
01:58:23.147 --> 01:58:26.191
-You insult me!
-l insult you!

1163
01:58:26.359 --> 01:58:29.319
A man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on.

1164
01:58:29.487 --> 01:58:32.531
-You dog, questioning your queen.
-Shame?

1165
01:58:32.699 --> 01:58:36.493
I've nothing to be ashamed of,
you arrogant brat.

1166
01:58:36.661 --> 01:58:40.539
I'll marry the girl if l want,
and l'll have as many sons as I want.

1167
01:58:40.707 --> 01:58:43.292
There's nothing you
or your harpy mother can do.

1168
01:58:43.459 --> 01:58:45.252
Why, drunken man, must you think...

1169
01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:47.879
...everything l do and say
comes from my mother?

1170
01:58:48.047 --> 01:58:51.008
Because I know her heart, by Hera...

1171
01:58:51.175 --> 01:58:53.385
...and l see her in your eyes.

1172
01:58:53.553 --> 01:58:56.096
You covet this throne too much.

1173
01:58:57.348 --> 01:59:02.769
We all know that she-wolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead.

1174
01:59:02.937 --> 01:59:05.147
Well, you can both dream, boy.

1175
01:59:05.315 --> 01:59:08.442
Philip, this is the wine talking.
Leave the boy. lt'll wait.

1176
01:59:08.610 --> 01:59:10.193
Now!

1177
01:59:11.362 --> 01:59:13.280
I command you.

1178
01:59:14.282 --> 01:59:17.576
Apologize to your kinsman.

1179
01:59:25.209 --> 01:59:26.960
Apologize.

1180
01:59:27.128 --> 01:59:29.630
No kinsman to me.

1181
01:59:33.217 --> 01:59:35.177
Good night, old man.

1182
01:59:36.721 --> 01:59:41.141
And when my mother remarries,
I'll invite you to her wedding.

1183
01:59:41.684 --> 01:59:43.644
You bastard!

1184
01:59:49.442 --> 01:59:51.151
You'll obey me. Come here.

1185
02:00:10.046 --> 02:00:13.674
This is the man who is going to
take you from Greece to Persia?

1186
02:00:13.841 --> 02:00:16.343
He can't even make it
from one couch to the next.

1187
02:00:16.678 --> 02:00:20.597
Get out of my palace!
You're exiled, you bastard!

1188
02:00:21.349 --> 02:00:24.685
Banished from the land.
You're not welcome here.

1189
02:00:25.603 --> 02:00:27.854
You're no son of mine!

1190
02:01:11.607 --> 02:01:15.736
In the spring, Alexander marched
an army of 1 50,000...

1191
02:01:15.903 --> 02:01:18.947
...across the passes of the Hindu Kush...

1192
02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:21.491
...into the unknown.

1193
02:01:22.744 --> 02:01:27.581
In his dream, it was the promised route
to the end of the world.

1194
02:01:27.749 --> 02:01:29.624
We were now a mobile empire...

1195
02:01:29.792 --> 02:01:33.670
...stretching back thousands of miles
to Greece.

1196
02:01:33.838 --> 02:01:36.590
Cooks and architects,
doctors, surveyors...

1197
02:01:36.758 --> 02:01:38.383
...moneylenders and wives...

1198
02:01:38.551 --> 02:01:41.428
...children, lovers, whores.

1199
02:01:41.596 --> 02:01:43.346
And slaves...

1200
02:01:43.514 --> 02:01:48.185
...that anonymous, bent, working spine
of this new beast.

1201
02:01:48.352 --> 02:01:52.189
Ravaged or expanded, for better or worse...

1202
02:01:53.065 --> 02:01:57.652
...no occupied territory
remained the same again.

1203
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:03.033
Although devoted to Roxane...

1204
02:02:03.201 --> 02:02:06.286
...Alexander's visits
to her tent diminished...

1205
02:02:06.454 --> 02:02:11.583
...as a year, then two, went by
without a successor...

1206
02:02:12.376 --> 02:02:15.629
...wounding Alexander's great pride.

1207
02:02:15.963 --> 02:02:19.549
The surveyors are saying that Zeus
chained Prometheus up there.

1208
02:02:19.717 --> 02:02:20.967
In one of those caves.

1209
02:02:22.929 --> 02:02:25.639
They say there's a giant eagle's nest
just above it.

1210
02:02:25.973 --> 02:02:30.769
I suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor Prometheus' liver.

1211
02:02:33.397 --> 02:02:36.858
You remember what Aristotle told us
of these mountains?

1212
02:02:37.735 --> 02:02:39.402
Yes, l do.

1213
02:02:40.196 --> 02:02:42.322
That when we reach these heights...

1214
02:02:42.490 --> 02:02:45.700
...we'd look back and see Macedonia
to the west...

1215
02:02:45.868 --> 02:02:48.495
...and the outer ocean to the east.

1216
02:02:52.542 --> 02:02:57.587
But l fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed.

1217
02:02:57.755 --> 02:02:59.881
A world of Titans.

1218
02:03:00.049 --> 02:03:04.052
The scouts have been up
every known trail, Alexander.

1219
02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:06.471
There is no way across.

1220
02:03:07.014 --> 02:03:11.184
Except to the south, into lndia.

1221
02:03:11.602 --> 02:03:14.688
Were we gods, we'd breach
these walls to the eastern ocean.

1222
02:03:15.523 --> 02:03:17.190
We will, Alexander.

1223
02:03:17.358 --> 02:03:20.026
In a few years' time, we will return.

1224
02:03:20.194 --> 02:03:24.030
But first, the men must see their homes.

1225
02:03:25.491 --> 02:03:27.534
Have you found your home...

1226
02:03:27.702 --> 02:03:29.369
...Ptolemy?

1227
02:03:34.041 --> 02:03:37.252
More and more, l think
it will be Alexandria.

1228
02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:41.548
Well, at least it's hot.

1229
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:44.259
And Thais...

1230
02:03:45.136 --> 02:03:47.220
...she loved it there.

1231
02:03:48.973 --> 02:03:51.224
Women bring men home.

1232
02:03:52.351 --> 02:03:57.272
-l have no such feeling.
-You have Babylon, Alexander.

1233
02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:59.566
Where your mother awaits your invitation.

1234
02:04:00.026 --> 02:04:02.527
Yes, l have Babylon.

1235
02:04:02.695 --> 02:04:07.073
But each land, each boundary l cross...

1236
02:04:07.241 --> 02:04:09.576
...l strip away another illusion.

1237
02:04:10.912 --> 02:04:13.246
I sense death will be the last.

1238
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.461
Yet still I push harder and harder...

1239
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:23.214
...to reach this home.

1240
02:04:28.763 --> 02:04:30.221
Where has our eagle gone?

1241
02:04:34.810 --> 02:04:36.937
We must go on, Ptolemy.

1242
02:04:38.230 --> 02:04:39.898
Until we find an end.

1243
02:06:28.674 --> 02:06:32.343
lndia, the land where the sun was born...

1244
02:06:32.511 --> 02:06:35.096
...fabled to be even richer than Persia...

1245
02:06:35.264 --> 02:06:39.309
...had never been explored or conquered.

1246
02:06:39.477 --> 02:06:44.814
From the beginning, we struggled
to unify a land without a center.

1247
02:06:44.982 --> 02:06:47.692
Kings who conspired against one another.

1248
02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:51.946
A labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers...

1249
02:06:52.114 --> 02:06:56.326
...to die by the thousands
for their strange gods.

1250
02:07:00.915 --> 02:07:04.709
We saw things we'd never dreamed
and could hardly describe.

1251
02:07:05.085 --> 02:07:08.046
We saw birds that could talk
and men that couldn't.

1252
02:07:09.965 --> 02:07:13.968
Crateros, in the advance party,
fought against men with hairy skins...

1253
02:07:14.136 --> 02:07:16.554
...who were tiny and
lived in the tops of trees.

1254
02:07:22.311 --> 02:07:25.063
-Over there!
-They're animals.

1255
02:07:25.231 --> 02:07:28.775
Until Hephaistion convinced us
these were animals who imitated men...

1256
02:07:28.943 --> 02:07:31.069
...but wore their own skin.

1257
02:07:32.279 --> 02:07:35.240
They called this tribe "monkey."

1258
02:07:35.908 --> 02:07:38.910
Monkey. Monkey.

1259
02:07:39.954 --> 02:07:43.706
But we saw little difference with
the tribes who lived among them.

1260
02:07:45.459 --> 02:07:48.837
-Look at his hand.
-lt's so much like ours.

1261
02:07:52.508 --> 02:07:53.758
Hello, little man.

1262
02:07:54.593 --> 02:07:59.556
-Do they speak?
-No, but they do sing and make noises...

1263
02:07:59.723 --> 02:08:01.808
...from the roofs of the forest.

1264
02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:07.647
We saw men
who walked naked in public...

1265
02:08:07.815 --> 02:08:12.026
...and spent hours at a time
staring and doing nothing.

1266
02:08:12.319 --> 02:08:15.446
Some who lived 200 years.

1267
02:08:17.032 --> 02:08:19.784
And then, there was the rain.

1268
02:08:25.624 --> 02:08:29.335
Never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods...

1269
02:08:29.503 --> 02:08:31.004
...for 60 days and nights.

1270
02:08:32.214 --> 02:08:34.299
Well done today.

1271
02:08:36.427 --> 02:08:38.720
Make sure the women and children
are fed.

1272
02:08:44.476 --> 02:08:46.603
You know better, Machatas.

1273
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:51.566
What's your son going to say?

1274
02:08:51.901 --> 02:08:54.319
Come on, man.
The older you get, the stronger.

1275
02:08:54.486 --> 02:08:58.031
Right, my king.
You're my horse, Alexander.

1276
02:08:58.198 --> 02:09:00.491
I'll be with you at your side.

1277
02:09:02.995 --> 02:09:04.787
Everything rotted in this rain...

1278
02:09:04.955 --> 02:09:09.167
...and scores of men died miserably
from the tiny serpents...

1279
02:09:09.335 --> 02:09:13.087
...that were everywhere in this evil land.

1280
02:09:14.924 --> 02:09:16.549
-What happened?
-lt's to the neck.

1281
02:09:16.717 --> 02:09:19.177
Oh, no. Zeus, no.

1282
02:09:19.345 --> 02:09:20.887
Hold on. Hold on.

1283
02:09:23.766 --> 02:09:26.893
Be brave.

1284
02:09:27.061 --> 02:09:29.103
Oh, Zeus.

1285
02:09:30.856 --> 02:09:34.275
Our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized...

1286
02:09:34.693 --> 02:09:36.861
...there was none to be had.

1287
02:09:37.529 --> 02:09:39.364
Tempers worsened.

1288
02:09:39.531 --> 02:09:42.492
We massacred all lndians who resisted.

1289
02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:44.744
And with the local water putrid...

1290
02:09:44.912 --> 02:09:47.705
...we drank the strong wine.

1291
02:10:41.719 --> 02:10:44.345
And as we moved south and east...

1292
02:10:44.513 --> 02:10:49.434
...Alexander often returned the lands
we'd conquered to their defeated kings...

1293
02:10:49.601 --> 02:10:51.436
...so as to make them allies.

1294
02:10:51.603 --> 02:10:54.647
But this did not sit well with the army...

1295
02:10:54.815 --> 02:10:56.107
...who began to wonder:

1296
02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:59.986
Were we here for riches?
Or had Alexander...

1297
02:11:00.154 --> 02:11:04.532
...in some remorseless and crazed quest
to imitate the glory of Herakles...

1298
02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:06.242
...forgotten them?

1299
02:11:06.994 --> 02:11:10.413
One thing an army
knows quickly in their bones...

1300
02:11:10.581 --> 02:11:12.999
...is which way the gods are blowing.

1301
02:12:41.088 --> 02:12:42.880
Kiss him!

1302
02:13:07.489 --> 02:13:10.074
-To Bagoas.
-To Bagoas!

1303
02:13:15.581 --> 02:13:19.709
-And to my mother's god, Dionysus...
-Dionysus!

1304
02:13:19.877 --> 02:13:24.213
...who, we're told by our lndian allies,
traveled here before Herakles...

1305
02:13:24.381 --> 02:13:27.133
...some 6000 years ago.

1306
02:13:27.301 --> 02:13:28.759
To a hero.

1307
02:13:28.927 --> 02:13:30.928
To a hero!

1308
02:13:50.782 --> 02:13:52.116
Roxane.

1309
02:13:58.957 --> 02:14:01.417
You lose face.

1310
02:14:01.585 --> 02:14:03.127
These lndians...

1311
02:14:03.295 --> 02:14:05.046
...they are a low, evil people.

1312
02:14:05.214 --> 02:14:07.632
You don't try to understand them.

1313
02:14:07.925 --> 02:14:10.134
I try.

1314
02:14:10.302 --> 02:14:13.262
But this l know, Alexander.

1315
02:14:13.513 --> 02:14:16.515
In Persia, you are a great king.

1316
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:18.434
Here...

1317
02:14:18.602 --> 02:14:20.561
...they hate you.

1318
02:14:23.357 --> 02:14:26.567
Let us go back to Babylon.

1319
02:14:27.611 --> 02:14:29.237
There, you are strong.

1320
02:14:31.490 --> 02:14:33.741
We'll talk about this later.

1321
02:14:33.909 --> 02:14:35.368
Yes.

1322
02:14:35.535 --> 02:14:37.119
Later.

1323
02:14:37.287 --> 02:14:38.829
Talk.

1324
02:14:41.541 --> 02:14:43.584
I shall come.

1325
02:14:43.752 --> 02:14:45.002
Tonight.

1326
02:14:46.004 --> 02:14:47.880
And l shall wait.

1327
02:14:49.716 --> 02:14:51.842
Good night, my king.

1328
02:14:53.345 --> 02:14:55.513
Your Majesty.

1329
02:14:57.266 --> 02:15:00.309
Come, Alexander, drink with us.

1330
02:15:02.688 --> 02:15:05.815
-Alexander.
-Alexander!

1331
02:15:07.776 --> 02:15:12.530
I remember a time
you hated how your father drank.

1332
02:15:12.698 --> 02:15:14.699
Now I know why.

1333
02:15:16.243 --> 02:15:20.288
Dionysus is hero.

1334
02:15:21.415 --> 02:15:25.126
But he is also mind breaker.

1335
02:15:25.294 --> 02:15:28.629
He destroys our self-control.

1336
02:15:29.172 --> 02:15:32.717
Self-control is a lover
I've known too long, Ptolemy.

1337
02:15:36.179 --> 02:15:39.056
The struggle worries me to the bone.

1338
02:15:40.267 --> 02:15:43.311
And success l find to be
as corrupt as failure.

1339
02:15:44.521 --> 02:15:48.733
But Dionysus,
bless his ancient soul...

1340
02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:51.610
...frees me from myself.

1341
02:15:51.987 --> 02:15:55.573
And then, l move up.

1342
02:15:58.577 --> 02:16:01.245
I am simply Alexander.

1343
02:16:05.459 --> 02:16:07.251
A toast to Bagoas.

1344
02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:13.549
And the 30,000 beautiful Persian boys...

1345
02:16:13.717 --> 02:16:16.260
...we're training to fight
in this great army.

1346
02:16:19.181 --> 02:16:21.265
And to the memory of Philip.

1347
02:16:21.433 --> 02:16:24.352
Had he lived to see his Macedonians...

1348
02:16:24.519 --> 02:16:27.563
...transformed into such...

1349
02:16:27.731 --> 02:16:29.315
...a pretty army.

1350
02:16:31.610 --> 02:16:32.943
To Philip.

1351
02:16:33.111 --> 02:16:35.196
To a real hero.

1352
02:16:35.364 --> 02:16:37.615
Philip!

1353
02:16:40.452 --> 02:16:45.247
To Cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of Bactria.

1354
02:16:45.415 --> 02:16:47.041
Cleitus.

1355
02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:51.128
That's a fancy way of putting it, Ptolemy.

1356
02:16:51.296 --> 02:16:54.340
But we all know what a pension
and an exile is...

1357
02:16:54.508 --> 02:16:56.675
...after 30 years' service.

1358
02:16:56.885 --> 02:16:58.552
Exile?

1359
02:16:58.804 --> 02:17:00.596
From where, Cleitus?

1360
02:17:00.764 --> 02:17:03.474
From my home, Alexander, Macedonia.

1361
02:17:03.642 --> 02:17:07.311
You could've asked me where l
wanted to spend the rest of my life.

1362
02:17:07.562 --> 02:17:11.565
You call governing
this major province exile?

1363
02:17:11.733 --> 02:17:14.819
Has Your Majesty given any
of his closest companions...

1364
02:17:15.612 --> 02:17:17.780
...a province so far from home?

1365
02:17:17.948 --> 02:17:21.325
Then you won't make a very
good satrap, will you, Cleitus?

1366
02:17:24.621 --> 02:17:26.247
So be it.

1367
02:17:26.415 --> 02:17:30.000
Let me rot in Macedonian rags...

1368
02:17:30.168 --> 02:17:32.336
...rather than shine...

1369
02:17:32.504 --> 02:17:34.630
...in Eastern pomp.

1370
02:17:35.132 --> 02:17:38.926
I won't quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you.

1371
02:17:39.094 --> 02:17:43.180
Hephaistion, Nearchus, Perdiccas.

1372
02:17:43.807 --> 02:17:48.185
As governor of one
of our most Asian of satrapies...

1373
02:17:48.353 --> 02:17:53.232
...Cleitus, does it not occur to you
that if my Persian subjects...

1374
02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:56.444
...bow down before me,
it's important for them to do so?

1375
02:17:56.611 --> 02:17:59.363
Do I insist on Greeks doing the same?

1376
02:17:59.531 --> 02:18:04.577
You accept Greek offerings
as a son of Zeus, do you not?

1377
02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:07.955
Only when offered.

1378
02:18:08.123 --> 02:18:10.958
Why don't you refuse
these vain flatteries?

1379
02:18:11.126 --> 02:18:13.711
What freedom is this, to bow before you?

1380
02:18:13.879 --> 02:18:16.630
You bow before Herakles,
and he was mortal...

1381
02:18:16.798 --> 02:18:18.382
...but a son of Zeus.

1382
02:18:18.550 --> 02:18:22.178
How can you, so young,
compare yourself to Herakles?

1383
02:18:23.388 --> 02:18:25.389
Why not?

1384
02:18:27.976 --> 02:18:30.436
I've achieved more in my years.

1385
02:18:30.604 --> 02:18:32.146
Traveled as far.

1386
02:18:32.314 --> 02:18:33.397
Probably farther.

1387
02:18:33.565 --> 02:18:35.816
Herakles did it by himself.

1388
02:18:35.984 --> 02:18:39.111
Did you conquer Asia
by yourself, Alexander?

1389
02:18:39.279 --> 02:18:41.030
Who planned the Asian invasion...

1390
02:18:41.198 --> 02:18:45.034
...when you were still being spanked
on your bottom by my sister Lanice?

1391
02:18:45.202 --> 02:18:47.119
Was it not your father?

1392
02:18:47.287 --> 02:18:49.246
Or is his blood no longer good enough?

1393
02:18:49.748 --> 02:18:53.334
-Zeus-Amon, is it?
-You insult me, Cleitus.

1394
02:18:53.502 --> 02:18:56.086
You mock my family. Be careful.

1395
02:18:56.630 --> 02:19:00.090
Never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends...

1396
02:19:00.258 --> 02:19:02.885
...asked us to fight with them
as equals in war.

1397
02:19:03.053 --> 02:19:04.970
Are we not good enough any longer?

1398
02:19:05.138 --> 02:19:07.264
I remember a time...

1399
02:19:07.432 --> 02:19:10.142
...when we could talk as men,
straight to the eye.

1400
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:13.062
None of this scraping, groveling.

1401
02:19:13.730 --> 02:19:15.898
I remember a time when we hunted...

1402
02:19:16.066 --> 02:19:19.109
...when we wrestled
on the gymnasium floor.

1403
02:19:19.277 --> 02:19:21.111
Now you kiss them?

1404
02:19:22.781 --> 02:19:27.785
Take a barbarian, childless wife
and dare call her queen?

1405
02:19:30.121 --> 02:19:34.083
Go quickly, Cleitus,
before you ruin your life.

1406
02:19:37.921 --> 02:19:41.423
Doesn't your great pride
fear the gods any longer?

1407
02:19:42.759 --> 02:19:46.136
This army....
This army is your blood, boy!

1408
02:19:46.304 --> 02:19:48.389
Without it, you're nothing!

1409
02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:56.855
You no longer serve the purpose
of this march!

1410
02:19:57.357 --> 02:20:00.067
-Get him from my sight!
-l don't serve your purpose?!

1411
02:20:00.235 --> 02:20:03.988
What was I serving when l saved
your puppy life at Gaugamela?

1412
02:20:04.155 --> 02:20:07.658
Were you Zeus' boy?
What if I left you to die in the dust there?

1413
02:20:07.826 --> 02:20:11.370
Do you think we'd be forced now
to mate with brown apes?

1414
02:20:11.538 --> 02:20:12.788
Alexander!

1415
02:20:12.956 --> 02:20:16.500
Turn out the guards!
Arrest him for treason!

1416
02:20:21.006 --> 02:20:22.673
-l'll go with him.
-Alexander.

1417
02:20:22.841 --> 02:20:24.508
-Who's with him?
-No.

1418
02:20:24.676 --> 02:20:26.176
Who's with him?

1419
02:20:26.845 --> 02:20:29.013
I call Father Zeus to witness.

1420
02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:31.473
I call you to trial before him!

1421
02:20:31.641 --> 02:20:34.143
And we'll see how deep
this conspiracy cuts!

1422
02:20:34.311 --> 02:20:36.854
-Take him!
-ln the name of the gods, get him out!

1423
02:20:37.022 --> 02:20:41.108
Now look at you!
Great white ass, Alexander.

1424
02:20:41.276 --> 02:20:43.068
Hiding behind his fairy god!

1425
02:20:43.236 --> 02:20:48.991
Or are you too great to remember
whose life was saved by me?!

1426
02:20:49.701 --> 02:20:55.039
-l am more a man than you'll ever be! Ever!
-Get him out!

1427
02:20:55.874 --> 02:20:59.877
-He's gone. He's gone.
-Alexander.

1428
02:21:00.045 --> 02:21:01.211
Come on!

1429
02:21:01.755 --> 02:21:06.508
What a tyrant you are!
An evil tyrant you've become, Alexander.

1430
02:21:06.676 --> 02:21:09.720
You speak of plots against you?
What about poor Parmenion?

1431
02:21:10.305 --> 02:21:11.305
Get out!

1432
02:21:11.473 --> 02:21:14.224
He served you well.
Look how you repaid him.

1433
02:21:14.392 --> 02:21:17.186
You made me do your foul deed.
Have you no shame?

1434
02:21:17.354 --> 02:21:21.231
You ungrateful wretch! No one, not my
vilest enemy, has spoken like you to me.

1435
02:21:21.399 --> 02:21:24.652
Hear what l say!
Despot. False king.

1436
02:21:26.112 --> 02:21:28.822
You and your barbarian mother
live in shame.

1437
02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:55.224
Cleitus.

1438
02:21:55.558 --> 02:21:58.060
Oh, my Cleitus. Cleitus.

1439
02:22:04.859 --> 02:22:06.402
-Let me pass.
-None can enter.

1440
02:22:06.569 --> 02:22:08.445
I am the queen.

1441
02:22:16.538 --> 02:22:18.706
I want to see him.
I've waited three days.

1442
02:22:18.873 --> 02:22:21.583
He says none, not even you.

1443
02:22:22.711 --> 02:22:26.630
-He needs me.
-No, he doesn't.

1444
02:22:26.798 --> 02:22:28.549
And he needs you?

1445
02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:31.969
Hephaistion, you make a mistake.

1446
02:22:35.682 --> 02:22:39.768
The army grows restless, questioning.

1447
02:22:40.979 --> 02:22:42.730
Alexander.

1448
02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:47.151
They need your reassurance.

1449
02:22:48.278 --> 02:22:49.987
Heinous.

1450
02:22:50.155 --> 02:22:53.991
Like an old lover they forgive,
but they will never forget.

1451
02:22:54.367 --> 02:22:59.079
-He was an aging drunk.
-He was my friend.

1452
02:23:00.999 --> 02:23:03.792
His sister Lanice nursed me.

1453
02:23:04.669 --> 02:23:06.879
And how did I repay her?

1454
02:23:08.339 --> 02:23:11.759
Two brothers dead,
fighting him by my own hands.

1455
02:23:11.926 --> 02:23:14.386
Her last remaining blood.

1456
02:23:17.849 --> 02:23:22.019
What will she do but weep
on the day of my birth?

1457
02:23:23.688 --> 02:23:25.814
Come. You know more than any...

1458
02:23:25.982 --> 02:23:30.736
...great deeds are done by men
who took and never regretted.

1459
02:23:30.904 --> 02:23:32.821
You're Alexander.

1460
02:23:32.989 --> 02:23:35.741
Pity and grief will only destroy you.

1461
02:23:35.909 --> 02:23:39.536
Have l become so arrogant
that I am blind?

1462
02:23:42.290 --> 02:23:47.836
Sometimes, to expect
the best of everyone is...

1463
02:23:48.004 --> 02:23:49.505
...arrogance.

1464
02:23:51.007 --> 02:23:56.386
Then Cleitus spoke true.
I have become a tyrant.

1465
02:23:57.222 --> 02:23:58.764
No.

1466
02:24:01.226 --> 02:24:03.352
But perhaps a stranger.

1467
02:24:05.146 --> 02:24:06.396
You've gone too far.

1468
02:24:08.525 --> 02:24:11.235
They don't understand you anymore.

1469
02:24:13.029 --> 02:24:17.032
They speak of Philip now...

1470
02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:21.119
...as if l were a passing cloud...

1471
02:24:21.287 --> 02:24:23.413
...soon to be forgotten.

1472
02:24:25.542 --> 02:24:27.376
I've failed...

1473
02:24:27.544 --> 02:24:29.253
...utterly.

1474
02:24:31.339 --> 02:24:33.173
You're mortal.

1475
02:24:33.633 --> 02:24:35.592
And they know it.

1476
02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:40.097
And they forgive you because
you make them proud of themselves.

1477
02:24:40.765 --> 02:24:43.684
Philip once said...

1478
02:24:45.645 --> 02:24:48.272
...that there's a Titan in all of us.

1479
02:24:49.274 --> 02:24:52.276
That they wait, mixed in our ashes.

1480
02:24:57.699 --> 02:25:00.117
It wasn't because of the wine, l killed.

1481
02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:03.036
It was because l wanted to.

1482
02:25:31.232 --> 02:25:34.401
Philip, King of Macedonia...

1483
02:25:34.569 --> 02:25:36.486
...and leader of the Greeks.

1484
02:25:37.238 --> 02:25:42.200
All my life, l've waited to see Greeks
grovel with respect for Macedonia.

1485
02:25:43.494 --> 02:25:45.621
Today is that day.

1486
02:25:50.084 --> 02:25:52.836
They say already,
"Philip was a great general...

1487
02:25:53.004 --> 02:25:56.840
...but Alexander is simply great."

1488
02:25:58.426 --> 02:26:01.094
But if you ever insult me again...

1489
02:26:01.262 --> 02:26:02.888
...l'll kill you.

1490
02:26:09.062 --> 02:26:10.479
I've missed you.

1491
02:26:10.647 --> 02:26:13.190
In the spring, Persia.

1492
02:26:13.358 --> 02:26:15.651
You'll command my horse from the right.

1493
02:26:15.818 --> 02:26:18.028
I'm honored, Father. I wouldn't miss it...

1494
02:26:18.196 --> 02:26:19.947
...for all the gold in the world.

1495
02:26:20.114 --> 02:26:22.240
Which, one day, you'll have.

1496
02:26:39.217 --> 02:26:41.677
Making himself a 1 3th god.

1497
02:26:41.844 --> 02:26:46.056
He's drunk so much wine,
my poor Philip, he's lost his mind.

1498
02:26:49.352 --> 02:26:52.062
-Your Majesty.
-Attalus.

1499
02:26:56.567 --> 02:26:59.403
I hope the prince
is enjoying the spectacle...

1500
02:26:59.570 --> 02:27:02.489
...as much as our regent.

1501
02:27:02.657 --> 02:27:04.199
He's very tired.

1502
02:27:08.496 --> 02:27:10.706
Hey.

1503
02:27:13.084 --> 02:27:16.211
-Pausanias, bring the rest of the guard.
-Royal guard!

1504
02:27:16.462 --> 02:27:19.172
To the arena! March!

1505
02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:22.259
No guard, Your Majesty?
In all this crowd?

1506
02:27:22.427 --> 02:27:25.762
-Greeks all over the place.
-Cleitus, Cleitus.

1507
02:27:26.472 --> 02:27:28.015
My Cleitus.

1508
02:27:28.516 --> 02:27:31.101
This man you can
always trust, Alexander.

1509
02:27:31.561 --> 02:27:33.145
Treat him as you would me.

1510
02:27:33.312 --> 02:27:35.522
He'll guard your back for you.

1511
02:27:36.024 --> 02:27:37.858
Yes, Father.

1512
02:27:38.026 --> 02:27:40.944
My people are guard enough today.

1513
02:27:41.112 --> 02:27:44.573
Let these Greeks see for themselves
how l can walk through my people.

1514
02:27:44.741 --> 02:27:46.283
Then let them call me tyrant.

1515
02:27:46.784 --> 02:27:50.120
Bring the main guard in
after my entry only.

1516
02:27:50.288 --> 02:27:53.957
Cleitus, make sure the wine
flows steady all day.

1517
02:27:54.125 --> 02:27:56.126
I want them to like me.

1518
02:28:03.259 --> 02:28:05.969
Weren't you told? l go in alone.

1519
02:28:06.137 --> 02:28:08.138
Follow with the main guard.

1520
02:28:08.306 --> 02:28:09.723
Go on.

1521
02:28:12.769 --> 02:28:16.104
-Go on.
-Father, it's best l go with you.

1522
02:28:18.316 --> 02:28:21.485
You want the world to see
you're my successor.

1523
02:28:21.652 --> 02:28:23.570
Is that what she wants?

1524
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:26.823
Don't look so hurt all the time,
Alexander. Be a man.

1525
02:28:26.991 --> 02:28:31.161
You count yourself lucky you were here
at all today, after your public display.

1526
02:28:34.999 --> 02:28:37.125
By Herakles, by Zeus, by all the gods...

1527
02:28:37.293 --> 02:28:39.836
...obey me this once!

1528
02:28:41.172 --> 02:28:43.799
Have courage, Father.

1529
02:28:43.966 --> 02:28:46.426
And go on your way
rejoicing that at each step...

1530
02:28:46.594 --> 02:28:48.804
...you may recall your valor.

1531
02:29:24.549 --> 02:29:28.468
And now, our beloved King Philip...

1532
02:29:28.636 --> 02:29:31.847
...in whose honor
these wedding games begin.

1533
02:29:49.699 --> 02:29:52.117
Pausanias, I told you--

1534
02:30:01.252 --> 02:30:02.335
Who's your new friend?

1535
02:30:02.503 --> 02:30:04.254
There's your new friend.

1536
02:30:05.381 --> 02:30:07.924
No! Please, don't! No!

1537
02:31:47.358 --> 02:31:49.985
The king lives!

1538
02:31:50.152 --> 02:31:53.446
Alexander, son of Philip!

1539
02:31:53.614 --> 02:31:56.199
May the gods bless the king!

1540
02:31:59.870 --> 02:32:02.622
Alexander is king!

1541
02:32:05.209 --> 02:32:07.919
You're king now. You're king.

1542
02:32:08.754 --> 02:32:11.423
Long live Alexander!

1543
02:32:13.092 --> 02:32:17.262
-Alexander!
-King Alexander!

1544
02:32:17.430 --> 02:32:20.890
Alexander!

1545
02:32:21.892 --> 02:32:24.894
Alexander is king!

1546
02:32:28.524 --> 02:32:31.901
May the gods bless Alexander!

1547
02:32:33.612 --> 02:32:36.781
May the gods bless the king!

1548
02:32:36.949 --> 02:32:38.742
Alexander!

1549
02:32:56.093 --> 02:32:58.803
You break my heart, you men.

1550
02:32:58.971 --> 02:33:00.764
Afraid.

1551
02:33:02.183 --> 02:33:03.808
Of course you have fears.

1552
02:33:03.976 --> 02:33:05.435
We all have fears...

1553
02:33:05.603 --> 02:33:08.772
...because no one has ever
gone this far before.

1554
02:33:09.273 --> 02:33:13.693
And now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean, our route home.

1555
02:33:13.986 --> 02:33:15.612
We'll build a fleet of ships...

1556
02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:18.782
...and sail all the way
back down the Nile to Egypt.

1557
02:33:18.949 --> 02:33:22.077
And from Alexandria,
we shall be home within weeks.

1558
02:33:22.453 --> 02:33:24.662
There to be reunited with our loved ones.

1559
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:28.458
To share our great treasures
and tales of Asia.

1560
02:33:28.626 --> 02:33:33.463
And to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time.

1561
02:33:34.632 --> 02:33:38.134
-Follow Alexander.
-l'll follow you.

1562
02:33:42.765 --> 02:33:44.516
What?

1563
02:33:44.683 --> 02:33:47.977
-Silence?
-We're with you, Alexander!

1564
02:33:48.354 --> 02:33:53.400
Crateros.

1565
02:33:53.567 --> 02:33:55.276
And another one.

1566
02:34:06.747 --> 02:34:07.997
My king.

1567
02:34:08.165 --> 02:34:10.166
I'm a fighting man.

1568
02:34:10.334 --> 02:34:14.254
I don't like no bellyaching.
I won't tolerate it in any of my units.

1569
02:34:15.673 --> 02:34:17.841
I lost many a man.

1570
02:34:18.968 --> 02:34:21.594
Young ones, never been with a woman.

1571
02:34:22.763 --> 02:34:24.931
Some died of disease.

1572
02:34:25.516 --> 02:34:29.727
Some were butchered in Scythia
by the banks of the Oxus.

1573
02:34:29.895 --> 02:34:31.646
Some died good.

1574
02:34:31.814 --> 02:34:34.858
Some just didn't get no luck.

1575
02:34:35.693 --> 02:34:37.402
But they died.

1576
02:34:39.738 --> 02:34:42.657
Forty thousand l come over with
eight years ago.

1577
02:34:42.825 --> 02:34:46.870
And we march after you
more than 1 0,000 miles.

1578
02:34:47.955 --> 02:34:51.708
In the rain and the sun,
we fought for you.

1579
02:34:51.876 --> 02:34:55.003
Some of us, 50 battles we've been in.

1580
02:34:55.713 --> 02:34:58.131
We killed many a barbarian.

1581
02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:04.637
And now when I look around,
how many of them faces do l see?

1582
02:35:04.805 --> 02:35:08.558
Now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here.

1583
02:35:08.726 --> 02:35:12.312
We hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters...

1584
02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:15.398
...cross a hundred more rivers.

1585
02:35:16.275 --> 02:35:20.403
Crateros. Good Crateros.

1586
02:35:21.238 --> 02:35:26.367
Who better than you to speak,
most noble of men.

1587
02:35:27.411 --> 02:35:31.289
But you know there's no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken.

1588
02:35:31.457 --> 02:35:37.253
By sword, knife, stone, catapult and club.
I've shared every hardship with all of you.

1589
02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:40.840
Aye, you have, my king,
and we love you for it.

1590
02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.428
But, by Zeus, too many have died.

1591
02:35:46.013 --> 02:35:49.557
You have no children, Alexander,
and we're just...

1592
02:35:49.725 --> 02:35:54.437
...humble men, we seek no disturbance
with the gods. All we wish for...

1593
02:35:54.605 --> 02:36:01.110
...is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time...

1594
02:36:01.570 --> 02:36:05.365
...before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call Hades.

1595
02:36:09.286 --> 02:36:12.956
Yes. You're right, Crateros.

1596
02:36:13.123 --> 02:36:14.457
I have been negligent.

1597
02:36:16.627 --> 02:36:19.462
I should've sent you
veterans home sooner, and I will.

1598
02:36:19.630 --> 02:36:22.340
The first of you
shall be the Silver Shields.

1599
02:36:22.508 --> 02:36:27.595
Then every man who's served seven years.
With full pensions from our treasury.

1600
02:36:28.931 --> 02:36:32.559
And respected, rich, loved.

1601
02:36:32.726 --> 02:36:37.605
You'll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives...

1602
02:36:37.773 --> 02:36:41.985
...and enjoy a peaceful death.

1603
02:36:43.279 --> 02:36:45.405
But you dream, Crateros.

1604
02:36:46.156 --> 02:36:50.451
Your simplicity long ended when
you took Persian mistresses and children...

1605
02:36:50.619 --> 02:36:54.956
...and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels.

1606
02:36:55.666 --> 02:37:01.004
Because you've fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men.

1607
02:37:02.006 --> 02:37:04.340
Do you not see?

1608
02:37:05.509 --> 02:37:08.803
And you, as well as I, know...

1609
02:37:08.971 --> 02:37:13.224
...that as the years decline
and the memories stale...

1610
02:37:13.392 --> 02:37:16.185
...and all your great victories fade...

1611
02:37:16.353 --> 02:37:22.025
...it will always be remembered,
you left your king in Asia!

1612
02:37:22.192 --> 02:37:24.861
For l will go on, with my Asians.

1613
02:37:28.365 --> 02:37:32.660
-To the jackals with you, then, Alexander.
-We come for you, and you discard us.

1614
02:37:32.828 --> 02:37:35.204
-Shame!
-We want to go home, Alexander.

1615
02:37:35.372 --> 02:37:37.123
We're tired of glory.

1616
02:37:37.291 --> 02:37:40.209
We want to see our wives
and children before we die.

1617
02:37:42.212 --> 02:37:44.297
I've got children I haven't even seen.

1618
02:37:48.093 --> 02:37:51.137
I want to see my children.

1619
02:37:51.305 --> 02:37:55.058
I paid for your bastard children.
I've taken nothing for myself.

1620
02:37:55.225 --> 02:37:57.352
And all l've asked of you
is one more month.

1621
02:37:57.519 --> 02:37:59.395
-Shame.
-That's your king.

1622
02:38:00.606 --> 02:38:01.981
What would your father say?

1623
02:38:02.149 --> 02:38:05.318
I've taken you further
than my father ever dreamed.

1624
02:38:05.486 --> 02:38:09.447
So go home. l look to the
barbarians for their courage.

1625
02:38:10.741 --> 02:38:12.325
I go east.

1626
02:38:12.493 --> 02:38:14.535
He wants us dead
so we can't speak of his crimes.

1627
02:38:14.703 --> 02:38:16.913
-Who said that?
-We won't make it to Macedonia.

1628
02:38:17.081 --> 02:38:18.831
You despicable coward. Come forth.

1629
02:38:18.999 --> 02:38:21.918
-Make your accusations public.
-So you can have us killed?

1630
02:38:22.086 --> 02:38:25.088
-Son of Zeus.
-You desecrate your real father's memory.

1631
02:38:25.255 --> 02:38:31.386
-Or did you murder him like you did Cleitus?
-Hide in this mob because I'll take your life.

1632
02:38:41.355 --> 02:38:46.275
You men insult my honor, my paternity.
Arrest him.

1633
02:38:46.443 --> 02:38:50.321
And him. Yes.
And you, this loudmouth Demetrius.

1634
02:38:50.489 --> 02:38:54.117
You call me murderer?
I have no such blood on my hands.

1635
02:38:54.368 --> 02:38:57.453
And him.
Yes, you'll know the pain of treason.

1636
02:38:58.622 --> 02:39:02.625
You mock my shame for Cleitus and say
I'd harm a hair of my father's head.

1637
02:39:03.335 --> 02:39:07.130
Arrest him.
After all l've done for you, you swine.

1638
02:39:07.297 --> 02:39:09.173
You cowards. Traitors.

1639
02:39:11.719 --> 02:39:14.095
Come on, then.
Where are your daggers?

1640
02:39:16.348 --> 02:39:20.601
In smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders...

1641
02:39:20.769 --> 02:39:25.982
...he did nothing, to my mind, that any
general in wartime would not have done.

1642
02:39:26.233 --> 02:39:29.652
But clearly, the army was divided.

1643
02:39:30.612 --> 02:39:34.657
And Alexander was no longer
loved by all.

1644
02:39:37.494 --> 02:39:41.998
He drove on, south to the outer ocean.

1645
02:39:43.667 --> 02:39:46.335
I confess a disaрpointment.

1646
02:39:46.503 --> 02:39:50.673
Esрecially on these reports of your
taking on Eastern ways.

1647
02:39:50.841 --> 02:39:56.387
Beware how these manners inflame
the senses with pride.

1648
02:39:56.972 --> 02:40:01.017
However, I have lived long enough now...

1649
02:40:01.185 --> 02:40:02.810
...to question...

1650
02:40:02.978 --> 02:40:08.691
...when so many others invest
such emotion in their disrespect for you.

1651
02:40:09.526 --> 02:40:15.865
I can only hope that you continue
what you began as the boy l knew at 1 2.

1652
02:40:16.033 --> 02:40:20.912
Be that man always, Alexander,
and you will not slip.

1653
02:40:21.079 --> 02:40:26.125
And perhaps you will prove
this old materialist...

1654
02:40:26.293 --> 02:40:29.045
...as you always thought me:

1655
02:40:29.213 --> 02:40:31.422
A dreamer after all.

1656
02:40:51.652 --> 02:40:53.069
Stay calm.

1657
02:40:53.403 --> 02:40:55.238
Together we are strong as gods.

1658
02:40:57.032 --> 02:41:01.494
Cover with your left,
strike hard with your right.

1659
02:41:05.290 --> 02:41:07.750
Fear is rot. A waste of time.

1660
02:41:13.799 --> 02:41:16.008
Lock shields.

1661
02:41:18.595 --> 02:41:20.763
Battle positions.

1662
02:41:22.850 --> 02:41:24.725
Move.

1663
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:36.279
Choppers, prepare your knives.

1664
02:41:36.613 --> 02:41:38.239
Follow me.

1665
02:41:50.627 --> 02:41:54.130
Strike hard, boys. Strike hard.

1666
02:42:12.357 --> 02:42:16.861
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you hang back? Hurry.

1667
02:42:17.029 --> 02:42:19.322
Cavalry!

1668
02:42:27.748 --> 02:42:31.083
Split to thirds. Regroup and encircle.

1669
02:42:50.312 --> 02:42:51.854
Hold the line.

1670
02:42:54.608 --> 02:42:55.775
We must die!

1671
02:43:35.565 --> 02:43:40.987
-Oh, no. Cavalry on me.
-Follow Alexander.

1672
02:43:44.574 --> 02:43:48.202
Charge. Charge. Charge.

1673
02:43:51.581 --> 02:43:53.207
The phalanx is in jeopardy.

1674
02:43:53.375 --> 02:43:56.711
Meleager, ride to Pharnakes
and tell him return to the center.

1675
02:43:56.920 --> 02:44:00.715
Find Hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center.

1676
02:44:00.924 --> 02:44:04.093
We must reach Crateros
before it's too late.

1677
02:44:27.617 --> 02:44:29.618
Hephaistion. To the center.

1678
02:44:33.540 --> 02:44:35.875
Come, Macedonians. Ride.

1679
02:44:36.168 --> 02:44:38.461
Ride!

1680
02:45:34.935 --> 02:45:37.520
Coenus! Get out of there.

1681
02:45:39.439 --> 02:45:40.940
No.

1682
02:46:10.846 --> 02:46:13.389
-The horses won't go.
-On foot, then.

1683
02:46:20.105 --> 02:46:24.066
Fall back, men! Fall back!

1684
02:46:25.443 --> 02:46:26.902
Come, Bucephalus.

1685
02:46:31.908 --> 02:46:33.784
Fear not, my friend.

1686
02:46:36.288 --> 02:46:37.955
Bucephalus.

1687
02:46:38.123 --> 02:46:40.166
'Tis only sun and shadow.

1688
02:46:43.170 --> 02:46:44.879
Bucephalus and Alexander.

1689
02:46:45.046 --> 02:46:46.547
One last time, it's you and me.

1690
02:46:48.925 --> 02:46:52.428
Isn't it a lovely thing
to live with great courage...

1691
02:46:52.596 --> 02:46:55.055
...and to die leaving an everlasting fame?

1692
02:46:55.724 --> 02:46:59.059
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you retreat?

1693
02:46:59.227 --> 02:47:05.065
Do you want to live forever?
In the name of Zeus, attack.

1694
02:47:21.291 --> 02:47:23.334
Attack.

1695
02:47:24.294 --> 02:47:26.795
Alexander!

1696
02:47:37.724 --> 02:47:39.725
Alexander.

1697
02:49:12.485 --> 02:49:14.194
-The king is down!
-To the king!

1698
02:50:38.530 --> 02:50:42.157
lt was the bloodiest of his battles.

1699
02:50:46.037 --> 02:50:47.830
Pure butchery.

1700
02:50:53.378 --> 02:50:55.337
We'd never be men again.

1701
02:52:14.334 --> 02:52:15.709
Get out.

1702
02:52:17.170 --> 02:52:18.629
Go.

1703
02:52:23.384 --> 02:52:25.969
How can you behave
so shamelessly in public?

1704
02:52:26.137 --> 02:52:28.680
Because it was meant to be.

1705
02:52:28.848 --> 02:52:30.682
This isn't how I wanted to become king.

1706
02:52:30.850 --> 02:52:34.853
-No one blames you.
-They blame me behind my back! ln secret.

1707
02:52:35.021 --> 02:52:37.105
-Slander is not power.
-Shame is?

1708
02:52:39.609 --> 02:52:41.610
Who killed my father?

1709
02:52:42.111 --> 02:52:43.737
Tell me.

1710
02:52:43.905 --> 02:52:46.657
Tell me, or shall I put you on trial
for his murder?

1711
02:52:46.824 --> 02:52:49.368
-Pausanias.
-He had help!

1712
02:52:49.619 --> 02:52:51.703
Did you help him?

1713
02:52:58.795 --> 02:53:01.088
No, never.

1714
02:53:01.631 --> 02:53:04.466
Why? Why would l?

1715
02:53:05.635 --> 02:53:07.302
So many wanted it.

1716
02:53:07.470 --> 02:53:10.138
Greeks, Persians, men, women.

1717
02:53:10.306 --> 02:53:13.058
I'd be shocked if there were not
a god he had not profaned.

1718
02:53:13.226 --> 02:53:14.768
How ironic though, in the end...

1719
02:53:14.936 --> 02:53:18.397
...a boy he rutted with once too often
returned the favor.

1720
02:53:18.606 --> 02:53:20.566
You're mad. You're cursed.

1721
02:53:20.733 --> 02:53:23.402
You've unleashed Furies,
you don't know their power.

1722
02:53:23.570 --> 02:53:26.488
Now who is exaggerating?

1723
02:53:27.365 --> 02:53:30.200
Even if it was the wish of your heart--

1724
02:53:30.368 --> 02:53:32.536
That's a lie! He was my father!
I loved him!

1725
02:53:32.704 --> 02:53:34.621
He was not your father!

1726
02:53:34.789 --> 02:53:36.873
You owe no blood debt to that man.

1727
02:53:37.041 --> 02:53:39.835
You lie and lie and lie.

1728
02:53:40.003 --> 02:53:43.171
So many lies you've spun
like a sorceress, confusing me.

1729
02:53:43.339 --> 02:53:46.758
Look at you. Look at you.

1730
02:53:46.926 --> 02:53:50.345
You are everything that he was not.

1731
02:53:50.555 --> 02:53:53.849
He was coarse, you are refined.

1732
02:53:54.017 --> 02:53:57.978
He was a general, and you are a king.

1733
02:53:58.146 --> 02:54:00.022
He could not rule himself...

1734
02:54:00.398 --> 02:54:03.525
...and you shall rule the world.

1735
02:54:03.693 --> 02:54:07.404
You're so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this.

1736
02:54:07.572 --> 02:54:09.656
Such thick pride...

1737
02:54:09.824 --> 02:54:11.533
...and no mourning for your husband.

1738
02:54:11.701 --> 02:54:13.118
Mourn...

1739
02:54:13.286 --> 02:54:14.870
...him?

1740
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:18.373
What do you know of Philip?

1741
02:54:19.876 --> 02:54:24.171
No, Alexander. Zeus is your father.

1742
02:54:24.881 --> 02:54:28.634
-Act like it.
-My first act would be to kill you!

1743
02:54:29.886 --> 02:54:32.262
You murdered me in my cradle.

1744
02:54:32.430 --> 02:54:34.640
You birthed me in a sack of hate.

1745
02:54:34.807 --> 02:54:36.975
Hate you have for those
stronger than you.

1746
02:54:37.143 --> 02:54:41.063
-Hate you have for men.
-l taught you my heart, Alexander!

1747
02:54:41.230 --> 02:54:44.149
And by Zeus and Dionysus,
you grew beautiful.

1748
02:54:44.317 --> 02:54:46.485
Damn your sorceress soul.

1749
02:54:46.653 --> 02:54:49.321
Your soul is mine, Alexander.

1750
02:54:50.823 --> 02:54:52.366
No! No!

1751
02:54:53.034 --> 02:54:56.912
You've taken from me everything
I've ever loved and made me you!

1752
02:54:57.580 --> 02:54:59.539
Stop it. Stop acting like a boy.

1753
02:54:59.707 --> 02:55:02.250
You're a king. Act like one.

1754
02:55:02.418 --> 02:55:04.086
Parmenion is with us, for once.

1755
02:55:04.253 --> 02:55:06.129
Execute Attalus without delay.

1756
02:55:06.297 --> 02:55:09.091
Confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever.

1757
02:55:09.258 --> 02:55:10.842
Eurydice? Never.

1758
02:55:11.010 --> 02:55:12.427
Laugh, you monster.

1759
02:55:12.595 --> 02:55:13.929
You heartbreaker.

1760
02:55:14.097 --> 02:55:17.015
How will you live out the year like this?

1761
02:55:17.183 --> 02:55:21.937
-Have you learned nothing from Philip?
-No. From you, Mother.

1762
02:55:25.024 --> 02:55:26.733
The best.

1763
02:55:36.911 --> 02:55:41.331
What have l done
to make you hate me so?

1764
02:55:44.043 --> 02:55:48.630
One day, you will understand this.

1765
02:55:48.798 --> 02:55:52.300
But l have only you in my heart.

1766
02:55:55.054 --> 02:55:58.306
I know what you need.

1767
02:55:59.183 --> 02:56:01.393
Now is the time.

1768
02:56:01.644 --> 02:56:03.812
The gods favor you.

1769
02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:07.482
Great wealth, power, conquest.

1770
02:56:07.650 --> 02:56:09.484
All you desire.

1771
02:56:09.652 --> 02:56:12.279
The world is yours!

1772
02:56:12.447 --> 02:56:20.662
Take it.

1773
02:56:42.852 --> 02:56:46.271
He never saw his mother again.

1774
02:56:49.901 --> 02:56:53.195
And while he was away,
fighting the Northern tribes...

1775
02:56:53.362 --> 02:56:58.950
...Olymрias had Philip's new wife,
Eurydice, and her infant son murdered.

1776
02:56:59.619 --> 02:57:05.123
By necessity, Alexander
had her uncle Attalus executed.

1777
02:57:45.581 --> 02:57:49.251
He lives! Alexander!

1778
02:58:11.315 --> 02:58:13.525
Men of Macedon...

1779
02:58:14.277 --> 02:58:16.444
...we're going home.

1780
02:58:17.446 --> 02:58:19.823
-What?
-What?

1781
02:58:20.908 --> 02:58:24.035
-Home?
-We're going.

1782
02:58:28.624 --> 02:58:30.625
We're going home.

1783
02:59:37.735 --> 02:59:40.820
His life should have ended in lndia...

1784
02:59:41.447 --> 02:59:42.906
...but that's myth.

1785
02:59:44.450 --> 02:59:49.871
In life, Herakles died of a poisoned shirt,
given him in error by his jealous wife.

1786
02:59:50.039 --> 02:59:51.373
Great Zeus...

1787
02:59:51.540 --> 02:59:53.792
...we have worshipped you in blood.

1788
02:59:54.919 --> 02:59:57.504
Look kindly on our homeward steps...

1789
02:59:57.672 --> 03:00:02.092
...and smile upon our backs.

1790
03:00:05.137 --> 03:00:10.433
May all those who come here after us
know, when they see this altar...

1791
03:00:10.601 --> 03:00:14.312
...that Titans were once here.

1792
03:00:28.828 --> 03:00:32.580
Making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey...

1793
03:00:32.748 --> 03:00:37.419
...Alexander bade the East farewell
and marched his army directly west...

1794
03:00:37.586 --> 03:00:39.963
...across the great Gedrosian desert...

1795
03:00:40.131 --> 03:00:43.341
...seeking the shortest route home
to Babylon.

1796
03:00:46.178 --> 03:00:51.057
Here, he watched helplessly
the cruel breaking of his army.

1797
03:00:51.225 --> 03:00:53.727
Not by any human foe...

1798
03:00:54.186 --> 03:00:56.438
...but by nature.

1799
03:00:57.690 --> 03:01:02.193
To this day, there is no accounting
of how many died.

1800
03:01:02.361 --> 03:01:05.280
lt was the worst blunder of his life.

1801
03:01:06.907 --> 03:01:11.703
And when he finally reentered Babylon,
after six years in the Far East...

1802
03:01:11.871 --> 03:01:17.792
...Alexander again seized the imagination
of the world by taking two more wives.

1803
03:01:18.711 --> 03:01:22.338
Now Alexander had three wives,
two lovers...

1804
03:01:22.506 --> 03:01:25.383
...a contentious mother
and a turbulent Greece...

1805
03:01:25.551 --> 03:01:28.887
...satraps of dubious loyalty
in several provinces...

1806
03:01:29.055 --> 03:01:32.140
...generals questioning his every decision.

1807
03:01:32.308 --> 03:01:38.563
And beneath it all, a restive new army
made uр of 1 0 Asians for every Greek...

1808
03:01:38.731 --> 03:01:41.691
...all held together by one slender thread.

1809
03:01:41.859 --> 03:01:45.195
They took another reading.
The harbor can only be dredged to 20 feet.

1810
03:01:45.362 --> 03:01:48.448
Then get a second opinion from
the Phoenicians. It goes deeper.

1811
03:01:48.616 --> 03:01:53.495
Alexander. We're well over 1 2,000 talents
on wood alone for the fleet.

1812
03:01:54.163 --> 03:01:56.706
And their armor costs are staggering.

1813
03:01:57.833 --> 03:02:00.502
-Cast another dye, we shall back them.
-How?

1814
03:02:00.669 --> 03:02:01.878
Our armor-- Our Treasury--

1815
03:02:02.046 --> 03:02:04.923
With our future, Cassander,
the best capital we have.

1816
03:02:05.091 --> 03:02:09.677
Even so, I seriously doubt the Phoenicians
can make a timber quote in time.

1817
03:02:09.845 --> 03:02:13.223
Perhaps we could sail with fewer ships
or delay until the spring--

1818
03:02:13.390 --> 03:02:15.683
There'll be no delays, Nearchus.

1819
03:02:15.851 --> 03:02:19.896
-Ptolemy, how goes our library?
-The trees are falling as we speak.

1820
03:02:20.064 --> 03:02:21.940
Good. We must not forget our libraries.

1821
03:02:22.983 --> 03:02:25.193
All the Alexandrias we have,
I want libraries.

1822
03:02:34.537 --> 03:02:37.372
-Just last night he was--
-lt's the water, Your Majesty.

1823
03:02:37.540 --> 03:02:39.916
He mixed it with the wine.

1824
03:02:40.876 --> 03:02:42.502
But how can this be?

1825
03:02:42.878 --> 03:02:46.673
-Typhus of lndia?
-l wouldn't tax yourself, Your Majesty.

1826
03:02:46.841 --> 03:02:52.178
A few good nights' rest will do it.
But no wine or cold chicken.

1827
03:02:52.346 --> 03:02:54.597
With the regimen of cares
that I've put in place--

1828
03:02:55.808 --> 03:02:57.142
Come, doctor.

1829
03:03:10.156 --> 03:03:12.490
I feel better.

1830
03:03:13.117 --> 03:03:16.828
Soon, l'll be up.

1831
03:03:17.913 --> 03:03:21.332
We leave for Arabia in the spring,
and l couldn't leave without you.

1832
03:03:22.334 --> 03:03:24.669
Arabia.

1833
03:03:27.673 --> 03:03:32.760
You used to dress me up like a sheik...

1834
03:03:33.596 --> 03:03:35.513
...wave your wooden scimitar.

1835
03:03:35.681 --> 03:03:38.766
You were the only one
who'd never let me win.

1836
03:03:40.603 --> 03:03:43.605
The only one who's ever been
honest with me.

1837
03:03:44.106 --> 03:03:47.025
You saved me from myself.

1838
03:03:49.445 --> 03:03:52.614
Please don't leave me, Hephaistion.

1839
03:04:01.290 --> 03:04:05.752
I remember the young man who wanted
to be Achilles...

1840
03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:08.880
...and then outdid him.

1841
03:04:09.048 --> 03:04:10.965
And then what happened?

1842
03:04:11.133 --> 03:04:14.469
Ours is a myth only young men believe.

1843
03:04:15.095 --> 03:04:21.267
-But how beautiful a myth it was.
-We reach, we fall.

1844
03:04:22.645 --> 03:04:25.480
Oh, Hephaistion.

1845
03:04:31.278 --> 03:04:36.658
-l worry for you without me.
-l am nothing without you.

1846
03:04:37.826 --> 03:04:40.912
Come, fight, Hephaistion.

1847
03:04:41.830 --> 03:04:44.332
We will die together.

1848
03:04:47.253 --> 03:04:52.840
We'll have children with our wives, and
our sons will play together as we once did.

1849
03:04:53.801 --> 03:04:57.428
A thousand ships
we'll launch from here, Hephaistion.

1850
03:04:58.138 --> 03:05:02.850
We'll round Arabia
and sail up the gulf to Egypt.

1851
03:05:03.686 --> 03:05:08.189
From there, we'll build a channel through
the desert and out to the Middle Sea.

1852
03:05:08.357 --> 03:05:13.319
And then we'll move on Carthage. And that
great island, Sicily, they'll pay large tribute.

1853
03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:18.199
After that, the Roman tribe,
good fighters. We'll beat them.

1854
03:05:19.243 --> 03:05:21.786
And then explore the northern forests...

1855
03:05:21.954 --> 03:05:25.123
...and out the Pillars of Herakles
to the western ocean.

1856
03:05:25.791 --> 03:05:30.003
And then one day,
populations will mix and travel freely.

1857
03:05:30.170 --> 03:05:32.880
Asia and Europe will come together.

1858
03:05:34.758 --> 03:05:38.678
And we'll grow old, Hephaistion...

1859
03:05:39.388 --> 03:05:45.018
...looking out our balcony
at this new world.

1860
03:05:51.692 --> 03:05:56.946
Hephaistion?

1861
03:05:58.532 --> 03:06:00.658
No!

1862
03:06:04.621 --> 03:06:09.167
-Where is this doctor?
-l can't explain this, Your Majesty.

1863
03:06:09.335 --> 03:06:13.755
-lt's not possible. l swear by Apollo.
-Execute him!

1864
03:06:14.673 --> 03:06:17.759
Take him out now and execute him.

1865
03:06:18.218 --> 03:06:22.430
-Come away, come away.
-Liars. Liars. You all hated him. All of you.

1866
03:06:23.098 --> 03:06:26.768
Get out. Get out now!

1867
03:06:34.860 --> 03:06:36.319
Be gone.

1868
03:06:37.446 --> 03:06:42.492
Be gone with you!
Harpies! Get out! Get out!

1869
03:06:42.659 --> 03:06:44.369
Are you drunk again?

1870
03:06:44.536 --> 03:06:46.120
-Get out.
-He's dead.

1871
03:06:46.288 --> 03:06:49.123
-Who?
-Many hated him...

1872
03:06:49.291 --> 03:06:52.126
...but l don't think any other
would have dared.

1873
03:06:53.629 --> 03:06:55.713
Hephaistion is dead?

1874
03:06:59.843 --> 03:07:01.803
Are you mad?

1875
03:07:03.722 --> 03:07:05.264
You monster.

1876
03:07:06.558 --> 03:07:09.644
-Are you mad?
-You've taken from me all l've ever loved.

1877
03:07:09.812 --> 03:07:13.773
May all the Furies through time
damn your miserable heart. Obey me.

1878
03:07:14.817 --> 03:07:19.487
Alexander.
I have your child. Alexander.

1879
03:07:20.989 --> 03:07:23.825
-Alexander, we have a son.
-No.

1880
03:07:25.452 --> 03:07:27.995
-The child.
-Oh, Your Majesty, no.

1881
03:07:28.163 --> 03:07:34.544
Alexander, I have your child.
Alexander, my husband, my king.

1882
03:07:34.711 --> 03:07:37.171
We have a son.

1883
03:07:37.673 --> 03:07:41.008
My poor, poor, ill-fated son.

1884
03:07:42.678 --> 03:07:44.345
Never touch me again.

1885
03:07:47.766 --> 03:07:49.809
No!

1886
03:07:55.399 --> 03:07:58.192
One last toast!

1887
03:08:01.530 --> 03:08:03.406
Before the dawn.

1888
03:08:10.456 --> 03:08:13.624
To my old friends.

1889
03:08:30.642 --> 03:08:34.228
-And to the myths.
-To the myths.

1890
03:09:03.425 --> 03:09:06.761
Yes, come on. Finish it.

1891
03:09:27.783 --> 03:09:29.951
To the next dawn.

1892
03:10:06.321 --> 03:10:08.489
My little Achilles.

1893
03:10:30.137 --> 03:10:33.180
-Bless you, Alexander.
-Lord, we love you.

1894
03:10:34.391 --> 03:10:36.684
Bless you, Alexander.

1895
03:10:44.276 --> 03:10:47.194
My lord, these herbs are from Delphi.

1896
03:10:47.362 --> 03:10:49.989
They saved my brother.

1897
03:10:50.490 --> 03:10:52.199
-Rest yourself.
-Thank you.

1898
03:10:53.368 --> 03:10:55.453
We love you, Alexander.

1899
03:11:00.959 --> 03:11:06.297
Alexander.

1900
03:11:10.552 --> 03:11:12.970
We love you, Alexander...

1901
03:11:14.222 --> 03:11:16.474
...and your seed.

1902
03:11:18.685 --> 03:11:20.895
Keep moving, men, please.

1903
03:11:26.360 --> 03:11:28.653
Yes, come.

1904
03:11:28.820 --> 03:11:35.409
Come to Babylon. l await you.
Your only loving son.

1905
03:11:41.416 --> 03:11:42.958
For the men.

1906
03:11:43.335 --> 03:11:44.919
Bagoas.

1907
03:11:51.259 --> 03:11:54.595
Can you prop me up a little?
It catches me here.

1908
03:12:04.272 --> 03:12:06.440
I've never been so idle.

1909
03:12:06.608 --> 03:12:09.610
The fleet will never get out by spring.
I must go.

1910
03:12:27.295 --> 03:12:29.755
You have given me all.

1911
03:12:30.924 --> 03:12:34.260
-Bagoas.
-And you have given me...

1912
03:12:34.428 --> 03:12:37.972
...the happiest times of my life,
Alexander.

1913
03:12:39.349 --> 03:12:43.936
Happy? What is happy?

1914
03:12:46.106 --> 03:12:49.483
While in your mind and body
are stretched to breaking...

1915
03:12:50.068 --> 03:12:53.028
...you have no thought beyond the next.

1916
03:12:54.281 --> 03:12:56.866
And you look back then...

1917
03:12:57.409 --> 03:12:59.994
...and there it was, happiness.

1918
03:13:00.996 --> 03:13:03.748
In the doing, never the thinking.

1919
03:13:06.001 --> 03:13:11.005
Still, you have made me so happy.

1920
03:13:19.181 --> 03:13:21.682
It is done, Bagoas.

1921
03:13:24.144 --> 03:13:26.020
It is done.

1922
03:13:49.252 --> 03:13:51.504
Wait. We have his son.

1923
03:13:51.671 --> 03:13:54.882
Alexander. Wait.

1924
03:13:56.092 --> 03:13:57.551
Wait.

1925
03:13:58.637 --> 03:14:00.721
Vultures. Wait.

1926
03:14:00.889 --> 03:14:02.556
We have his son.

1927
03:14:02.849 --> 03:14:05.684
Just three more months.

1928
03:14:05.852 --> 03:14:07.812
Please live.

1929
03:14:10.565 --> 03:14:13.234
Alexander, the army will divide.

1930
03:14:13.401 --> 03:14:16.529
Satrapies will revolt.
Without orders, there'll be war.

1931
03:14:16.738 --> 03:14:19.240
We beg you. Tell us who.

1932
03:14:22.077 --> 03:14:23.953
Who will rule this great empire?

1933
03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:28.332
-Who do you want to, Alexander?
-We beg you, tell us.

1934
03:14:29.543 --> 03:14:31.168
The myth becomes real.

1935
03:14:37.008 --> 03:14:38.801
You're terrible.

1936
03:14:45.308 --> 03:14:47.935
All that matters is what you've done.

1937
03:14:48.103 --> 03:14:51.063
Zeus is your father.

1938
03:14:56.361 --> 03:14:57.653
Who will it be?

1939
03:14:58.947 --> 03:15:01.490
Pray tell us, who?

1940
03:15:03.785 --> 03:15:06.453
-What did he say?
-"To the best."

1941
03:15:08.582 --> 03:15:11.000
-He said, "To the best."
-What?

1942
03:15:11.167 --> 03:15:13.377
-No, he said, "To Crateros."
-To Crateros?

1943
03:15:13.545 --> 03:15:15.212
Why would he say Crateros?

1944
03:16:17.776 --> 03:16:22.029
On the 1 0th of June,
a month short of his 33rd year...

1945
03:16:22.197 --> 03:16:26.659
...Alexander's great heart
finally gave out.

1946
03:16:26.868 --> 03:16:31.038
And as he vowed,
he joined Heрhaistion.

1947
03:16:34.209 --> 03:16:36.919
But in his short life,
he achieved, without doubt...

1948
03:16:37.087 --> 03:16:42.424
...the mythic glory
of his ancestor Achilles and more.

1949
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:50.182
Olympias' transgression
in the murder of his father...

1950
03:16:50.350 --> 03:16:53.185
...is, to my mind, a probability.

1951
03:16:53.353 --> 03:16:55.896
His, a burden.

1952
03:16:57.691 --> 03:17:02.486
Alexander was too in love with glory
for him to steal it.

1953
03:17:06.449 --> 03:17:10.744
But by blood, and blood alone,
he was guilty.

1954
03:17:10.912 --> 03:17:15.249
No!

1955
03:17:23.299 --> 03:17:26.135
-Bolt the doors.
-The body stays in Babylon.

1956
03:17:26.302 --> 03:17:30.180
-The body belongs to Macedon.
-Within hours...

1957
03:17:30.348 --> 03:17:33.934
...we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse.

1958
03:17:34.102 --> 03:17:38.814
The wars of the world had begun.
Forty years, off and on, they endured.

1959
03:17:38.982 --> 03:17:43.235
Cassander in Greece.
Crateros and Antigonus in western Asia.

1960
03:17:43.403 --> 03:17:47.865
Solucas and Perdiccas in the East.
Myself in Egyрt.

1961
03:17:48.033 --> 03:17:51.410
Until we divided his emрire in four рarts.

1962
03:17:51.578 --> 03:17:53.454
Gentlemen, we are not savages.

1963
03:17:53.621 --> 03:17:55.205
-We are the future--
-Get out!

1964
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:59.126
I think Alexander would have been
disapрointed in us.

1965
03:18:01.963 --> 03:18:07.301
Naturally, rumors grew he'd been poisoned
by one faction of his generals or another...

1966
03:18:07.469 --> 03:18:12.890
...but the truth in these matters
has long since been driven from currency.

1967
03:18:15.143 --> 03:18:19.480
Cassander saw to that
with his fake diaries...

1968
03:18:19.647 --> 03:18:24.485
...painting Alexander
as a sick and bloated drunk.

1969
03:18:24.819 --> 03:18:29.448
Many believed,
to remove suspicion from himself.

1970
03:18:32.327 --> 03:18:37.372
He certainly proved he had the temperament
for politics and murder...

1971
03:18:37.540 --> 03:18:42.669
...when seven years later,
he executed Olympias.

1972
03:18:43.671 --> 03:18:47.299
Met her death with great courage.

1973
03:18:48.343 --> 03:18:53.097
Five years--
No, it was six years after that...

1974
03:18:53.264 --> 03:18:59.353
...Cassander finally achieved the complete
destruction of Alexander's bloodline...

1975
03:18:59.521 --> 03:19:02.189
...when he poisoned Roxane...

1976
03:19:02.565 --> 03:19:06.151
...and Alexander's 1 3-year-old son...

1977
03:19:07.695 --> 03:19:10.531
...the true heir to the empire.

1978
03:19:14.869 --> 03:19:18.372
But Roxane too, like Olympias...

1979
03:19:18.540 --> 03:19:24.294
...played by stern rules,
supported by several generals.

1980
03:19:24.462 --> 03:19:30.342
Days after Alexander's death,
she had Stateira poisoned.

1981
03:19:31.010 --> 03:19:32.970
It was reason enough
for some to believe...

1982
03:19:33.138 --> 03:19:36.932
...she was the one behind
Hephaistion's sudden demise.

1983
03:19:37.100 --> 03:19:39.893
But this is unproven in my mind.

1984
03:19:40.061 --> 03:19:43.313
Bagoas disappeared
from the histories entirely...

1985
03:19:43.481 --> 03:19:46.150
...a wise move, perhaps.

1986
03:19:46.985 --> 03:19:50.279
But l will say his love and devotion
for Alexander...

1987
03:19:52.323 --> 03:19:55.617
...were unquestionable and extraordinary.

1988
03:20:02.917 --> 03:20:07.045
Now I am the keeper of his body...

1989
03:20:07.213 --> 03:20:10.382
...embalmed here in the Egyptian ways.

1990
03:20:11.217 --> 03:20:16.722
I followed him as Pharaoh,
and have now ruled 40 years.

1991
03:20:19.309 --> 03:20:24.438
I have two sons,
each jealous of the other's power.

1992
03:20:27.066 --> 03:20:31.236
But they will grow to make
fine fathers and husbands.

1993
03:20:31.404 --> 03:20:35.574
And l trust they'll be just in their affairs.

1994
03:20:37.118 --> 03:20:39.953
But they have never seen...

1995
03:20:40.121 --> 03:20:42.873
...the great cavalry charge of Gaugamela...

1996
03:20:43.041 --> 03:20:46.293
...or the mountains of the Hindu Kush...

1997
03:20:46.794 --> 03:20:52.299
...when we crossed
a hundred-thousand-man army into lndia.

1998
03:20:59.474 --> 03:21:02.059
He was a god, Cadmos...

1999
03:21:02.936 --> 03:21:05.854
...or as close as anything
I've ever known.

2000
03:21:06.022 --> 03:21:09.900
"Tyrant!" they yell so easily. l laugh.

2001
03:21:10.068 --> 03:21:12.778
No tyrant ever gave back so much.

2002
03:21:12.946 --> 03:21:15.572
What do they know of the world,
these schoolboys?

2003
03:21:16.199 --> 03:21:18.575
It takes strong men to rule.

2004
03:21:18.743 --> 03:21:24.998
Alexander was more, he was a Prometheus,
a friend to man. He changed the world.

2005
03:21:25.833 --> 03:21:28.752
Before him, there were tribes...

2006
03:21:29.170 --> 03:21:33.465
...and after him, all was possible.

2007
03:21:33.633 --> 03:21:38.345
There was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king...

2008
03:21:38.513 --> 03:21:40.681
...and be better for all.

2009
03:21:43.017 --> 03:21:46.603
Eighteen great Alexandrias he built
across this world.

2010
03:21:46.771 --> 03:21:52.526
It was an empire, not of land
and gold, but of the mind.

2011
03:21:53.778 --> 03:21:56.947
It was a Hellenic civilization...

2012
03:21:57.115 --> 03:22:00.951
...open to all.

2013
03:22:04.956 --> 03:22:08.625
But the truth is never simple...

2014
03:22:09.502 --> 03:22:11.545
...and yet it is.

2015
03:22:12.046 --> 03:22:14.923
The truth is, we did kill him.

2016
03:22:18.678 --> 03:22:22.055
By silence, we consented.

2017
03:22:22.515 --> 03:22:24.474
Because--

2018
03:22:24.642 --> 03:22:27.185
Because we couldn't go on.

2019
03:22:27.353 --> 03:22:32.607
What, by Ares, did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end, like Cleitus?

2020
03:22:32.775 --> 03:22:38.071
After all this time, to give away our wealth
to Asian sycophants we despised?

2021
03:22:38.239 --> 03:22:41.450
Mixing the races, harmony?

2022
03:22:42.452 --> 03:22:45.245
Oh, he talked of these things...

2023
03:22:45.413 --> 03:22:51.168
...but wasn't it really about Alexander
and another population ready to obey him?

2024
03:22:52.211 --> 03:22:55.130
I never believed in his dream.

2025
03:22:55.298 --> 03:22:57.382
None of us did.

2026
03:22:59.177 --> 03:23:01.428
That's the truth of his life.

2027
03:23:01.596 --> 03:23:04.222
The dreamers exhaust us.

2028
03:23:04.932 --> 03:23:09.102
They must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams.

2029
03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:13.357
Oh, just throw all that away, Cadmos.

2030
03:23:13.524 --> 03:23:15.942
It's an old fool's rubbish.

2031
03:23:17.779 --> 03:23:23.116
You shall write, "He died of fever
and a weakened condition."

2032
03:23:23.993 --> 03:23:25.786
Yes, great Pharaoh.

2033
03:23:25.953 --> 03:23:29.873
Oh, he could have stayed home in
Macedonia, married, raised a family.

2034
03:23:31.125 --> 03:23:34.169
He'd have died a celebrated man.

2035
03:23:36.506 --> 03:23:39.299
But this was not Alexander.

2036
03:23:39.717 --> 03:23:45.472
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

2037
03:23:45.640 --> 03:23:51.978
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

2038
03:23:53.356 --> 03:23:57.317
The freest man l've ever known.

2039
03:23:58.986 --> 03:24:03.990
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

2040
03:24:04.158 --> 03:24:07.911
...and impatience with those
who could not understand.

2041
03:24:08.246 --> 03:24:10.956
And if his desire...

2042
03:24:11.124 --> 03:24:16.002
...to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure....

2043
03:24:18.548 --> 03:24:21.758
What failure!

2044
03:24:21.926 --> 03:24:28.140
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

2045
03:24:32.770 --> 03:24:34.521
I've lived--

2046
03:24:34.730 --> 03:24:37.023
I've lived long life, Cadmos...

2047
03:24:37.191 --> 03:24:39.651
...but the glory
and the memory of man...

2048
03:24:39.819 --> 03:24:44.739
...will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

2049
03:24:45.199 --> 03:24:50.454
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

2050
03:24:51.664 --> 03:24:55.542
...Megas Alexandros.

2051
03:24:57.003 --> 03:25:00.213
The greatest of them all.
