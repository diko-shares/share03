1
00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:25.262
He was a god, Cadmos...

2
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.067
...or as close as anything I've ever seen.

3
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.075
"Tyrant!" they yell so easily. I laugh.

4
00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.976
No tyrant ever gave back so much.

5
00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:39.278
What do they know of the world,
these schoolboys?

6
00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:42.454
It takes strong men to rule.

7
00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:48.789
Alexander was more, he was a Prometheus,
a friend to man. He changed the world.

8
00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:52.057
Before him, there were tribes...

9
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.735
...and after him, all was possible.

10
00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:02.740
There was suddenly a sense the world
could be ruled by one king...

11
00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.401
...and be better for all.

12
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:11.241
Eighteen great Alexandrias he built
across this world.

13
00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:16.652
It was an empire, not of land
and gold, but of the mind.

14
00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.918
A Hellenic civilization...

15
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:24.291
...open to all.

16
00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:30.526
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not.

17
00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:34.038
We idolize him,
make him better than he was.

18
00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:38.667
Men, all men, reach and fall...

19
00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.040
...reach and fall.

20
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.717
In the East, the vast Persian Empire
ruled almost all the known world.

21
00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.492
In the West,
the once great Greek city-states...

22
00:04:57.664 --> 00:05:04.161
...Thebes, Athens, Sparta,
had fallen from pride.

23
00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:12.869
It was Philip, the one-eyed,
who changed all this...

24
00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:17.847
...uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders
from the high and lowlands.

25
00:05:18.018 --> 00:05:22.182
With his blood and guts,
he built a professional army...

26
00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:26.155
...that brought the devious Greeks
to their knees.

27
00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:29.686
He then turned his eye on Persia...

28
00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:33.929
...where it was said
the new Great King Darius himself...

29
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.367
...on his throne in Babylon, feared Philip.

30
00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:49.143
It was from these loins of war
that Alexander was born, in Pella.

31
00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:03.419
Some called his mother,
Queen Olympias, a sorceress...

32
00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:10.094
...and said that Alexander
was the child of Zeus.

33
00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:15.472
But truly, there was not a man
in Macedonia who didn't look...

34
00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:20.409
...at father and son, side by side,
and wonder.

35
00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:26.152
Fortune favors bold ones

36
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:33.317
Trust the ones who give you love

37
00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:40.233
Life has just begun, son

38
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.132
Her skin is water.

39
00:06:44.304 --> 00:06:46.602
Her tongue is fire.

40
00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.206
She is your friend.

41
00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.177
Take it.

42
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.246
If you hesitate, she will strike.

43
00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:06.252
Yes.

44
00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.354
They are like people.

45
00:07:11.464 --> 00:07:17.961
You can love them for years.
Feed them, nurture them...

46
00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:23.269
...but still, they can turn on you.

47
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.242
Don't hurt her.

48
00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:36.486
Good.

49
00:07:38.925 --> 00:07:40.359
Come.

50
00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.567
He calls me a barbarian.

51
00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:52.603
He makes a mockery
of Dionysus every night.

52
00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:23.833
Women are the only ones
who know Dionysus.

53
00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:58.972
My little Achilles.

54
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.489
Stay, Alexander, down. Down.

55
00:09:24.998 --> 00:09:26.966
What is it you want?

56
00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.999
Six months. Did you miss me?

57
00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:32.833
-No. Not here!
-Proud bitch. I'm still your king.

58
00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:36.032
King of what? Sheepherders?

59
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:45.918
-I am of Achilles' royal blood.
-The blood of Herakles runs in my veins.

60
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:49.056
-You are nothing but a drunken whore.
-Shut your mouth.

61
00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:50.986
You 10-titted bitch from Hades!

62
00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:54.650
Which god could I curse to
have ever laid eyes on you!

63
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.128
You think they don't know your bastards?

64
00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:10.034
Damn your sorceress soul! You keep him
here like one of your snakes!

65
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.145
I told you not!
I told you not.

66
00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:16.010
-You'll obey me.
-I will not.

67
00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:20.517
You'll obey me, or I'll kill you
with my own hands.

68
00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:27.154
Let her go! No! Stop! Papa!

69
00:10:29.863 --> 00:10:33.356
-Obey me!
-Your Majesty! No!

70
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:36.933
In the name of the gods.

71
00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:42.303
He will never be yours! Never!

72
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:47.140
In my womb, I carried my avenger!

73
00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:59.857
In the world he grew up to...

74
00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:04.964
...I've come to believe it was in
friendship that Alexander found his sanity.

75
00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:08.567
You don't need much to fight.

76
00:11:08.735 --> 00:11:15.163
When you're in the front ranks of a battle,
facing some Northern barbarian tribe...

77
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:19.403
...courage won't be in the lining
of your stomach, Nearchus.

78
00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:23.516
It's in the heart of a man.

79
00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:27.984
You don't need to eat every day
or until you're full, Ptolemy.

80
00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:30.555
You don't need to lie in bed
in a morning...

81
00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:34.921
...when you can have some good bean soup,
Cassander, after a forced night march.

82
00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:40.191
Come on, Alexander. Come on.

83
00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.267
Who will respect you as a king?
You think because of your father?

84
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:49.603
The first rule of war is to do what you
ask your men to do. No more, no less.

85
00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.739
Good. That's it.

86
00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:59.442
Well done, Hephaistion. Good wrestling.
That's what I want.

87
00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:01.144
Come, come, come.

88
00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:03.119
You did well, but you lost.

89
00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:08.784
Now, both of you, congratulate
the other. Go on.

90
00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:11.693
Would you want me to let you win,
Alexander?

91
00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:15.996
You're right.

92
00:12:16.169 --> 00:12:19.230
But I promise you, I will beat
you one day, Hephaistion.

93
00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:26.470
It was said later that Alexander
was never defeated...

94
00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:28.580
...except by Hephaistion's thighs.

95
00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.877
Although an inferior race...

96
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:36.784
...the Persians control at least
four-fifths of the known world.

97
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.518
They rule, and we sit around like frogs.

98
00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:42.923
-Master?
-Yes?

99
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.427
-Master!
-Out with it!

100
00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.532
-Why are the Persians so cruel?
-Oh, come on, Nearchus.

101
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.964
That is not the subject for today,
Nearchus.

102
00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:54.767
But it is true that the Oriental races
are known for their barbarity...

103
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.774
...and their slavish devotion
to their senses.

104
00:12:57.944 --> 00:13:01.778
Excess in all things is the undoing of men.

105
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:04.542
That is why we Greeks are superior.

106
00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:07.277
We practice control of our senses.

107
00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.820
Moderation, we hope.

108
00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:12.390
And what of Achilles at Troy, master?

109
00:13:12.558 --> 00:13:17.496
-Was he not excessive?
-Achilles simply lacks restraint.

110
00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:21.658
He dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle...

111
00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:25.065
...crazed with grief over
his dead lover, Patroclus...

112
00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:30.142
...he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man.

113
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.213
Would you say the love between Achilles
and Patroclus is a corrupting one?

114
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.874
When men lie together in lust,
it is a surrender to the passions...

115
00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:42.886
...and does nothing
for the excellence in us.

116
00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:47.493
Nor does any other excess, Cassander,
jealousy among them.

117
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:53.056
But when men lie together, and knowledge
and virtue are passed between them...

118
00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:56.827
...that is pure and excellent.

119
00:13:57.003 --> 00:14:01.167
When they compete to bring out the good,
the best in each other...

120
00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:05.278
...this is the love between men that
can build a city-state...

121
00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:07.937
...and lift us from our frog pond.

122
00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:12.749
Now, back to geography
and things that we know.

123
00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:18.688
Is it possible that the source
of Egypt's mighty River Nile...

124
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:22.522
...could rise in these distant
mountains of the outer earth?

125
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:28.759
If so, an experienced navigator
could find his way here...

126
00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:33.600
...by this river east, down
into the great plains of India...

127
00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:38.370
...out into the eastern ocean
at end of the world...

128
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:42.447
...and by this route up the Nile...

129
00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:48.713
...back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea
and home to Greece.

130
00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:52.485
Now, if only these frogs
could look outward...

131
00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:56.617
...and act on their favored position
at the center...

132
00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.890
...Greece could rule the world.

133
00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:04.626
Why is it, master, in myth,
these lands you speak of are known?

134
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:11.139
India, where Herakles
and Dionysus traveled.

135
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:16.805
All these men who went east,
Theseus, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.

136
00:15:16.983 --> 00:15:20.817
From generation to generation,
their stories have been passed on.

137
00:15:20.987 --> 00:15:23.581
Why? Unless there was truth to them?

138
00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:29.354
Tales of Amazons? Minotaurs, Gorgons,
Icarus flying into the sun? No, Alexander.

139
00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:33.295
Only common people believe these tales,
as they believe most anything.

140
00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:38.096
We are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions.

141
00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:43.374
But if we are superior to the Persians,
as you say, why do we not rule them?

142
00:15:43.543 --> 00:15:49.107
It is-- It has always been
our Greek dream to go east.

143
00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.376
My father long wants it.

144
00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:57.385
The East has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams.

145
00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:03.587
But still, to think it's these myths
that lead us forward to the greatest glory...

146
00:16:03.763 --> 00:16:05.629
...why is it wrong to act on them?

147
00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:10.727
I can only warn you, not teach you.

148
00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:14.203
Beware of what you dream for.

149
00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:18.571
The gods have a way
of punishing such pride.

150
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.644
Philip brought such as Aristotle from
Athens to educate our rough people.

151
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:33.258
And growing more ambitious, he now
planned the invasion of Persia.

152
00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:43.866
The best you can do, Cleitus? Back
to the phalanx with you, I'll ride him myself.

153
00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.403
No one will ride that beast, Your Majesty.

154
00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.565
Not with your leg.

155
00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:51.638
He's been beaten far too often.

156
00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:55.505
My noble king,
he's a high-spirited animal, yes.

157
00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:59.481
High-spirited and worthy
of Philip of Macedon.

158
00:16:59.652 --> 00:17:01.814
For three and a half talents...

159
00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.650
...I couldn't make a profit
on him, but for you--

160
00:17:04.824 --> 00:17:07.589
Why would I want such a beast?
I already have a wife.

161
00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:11.163
Do I seem so old?

162
00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:20.768
-Stay down, stay down.
-Hold him!

163
00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:39.322
A broken neck comes free. He's
too nervous for battle. Sell him for meat.

164
00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:42.894
Buy him for me, Father. I'll ride him.

165
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.899
And if you don't?

166
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:52.663
-I'll pay for him myself.
-With what, your singing voice?

167
00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.602
I'll pay you!

168
00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:58.210
I tell you, that horse can't be ridden,
lad. His mind is broken.

169
00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:04.105
He can be ridden. By me.

170
00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:07.048
If you can rule that horse,
I'll make him yours...

171
00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:09.187
...at half the price.

172
00:18:09.355 --> 00:18:11.619
That horse will kill him, Philip.

173
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.919
-He'll break the boy in two.
-Will he?

174
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.892
Perhaps she'll make
a musician out of him yet.

175
00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:30.536
The boy doesn't have the craft.
He could hurt himself.

176
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.578
He'll have to figure that out
for himself. It's time.

177
00:18:40.886 --> 00:18:43.981
You don't like your shadow, do you?

178
00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:48.093
It's like a dark spirit coming up to get you.

179
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.163
Do you see? That's us.

180
00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:56.034
It's just a trick of Apollo's.

181
00:18:56.202 --> 00:19:00.662
He's the god of the sun.

182
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:08.209
But I'll show you how to outwit him,
you and me together.

183
00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.203
Bucephalus.

184
00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:37.331
That's what I'll call you.
Strong and stubborn.

185
00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:43.207
Bucephalus and Alexander.

186
00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:48.349
Come now, let's ride together.

187
00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:22.917
He's got some Titan in him yet.

188
00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:27.720
Attalus! Cleitus! For Zeus' sake,
he beat you, man!

189
00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:36.065
Now, Bucephalus, show them.

190
00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.332
My son.

191
00:21:10.503 --> 00:21:12.164
My son!

192
00:21:24.517 --> 00:21:28.010
It was an iron age. Blood feuds.

193
00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:34.183
In those days, fathers feared their sons'
treachery, and would eat them.

194
00:21:34.894 --> 00:21:38.455
But Zeus' mother tricked her husband,
that Titan Cronus...

195
00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:43.535
...and fed him a stone instead of their son,
which the fool ate.

196
00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:48.469
So Zeus, protected by his mother...

197
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:51.838
...grew up, killed his father
with his thunderbolt...

198
00:21:52.011 --> 00:21:56.539
...and the war between the Titans
and Olympians began.

199
00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.452
You remember Prometheus...

200
00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:04.522
...who stole the secret of fire
and gave it to man.

201
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.352
It made Zeus so angry...

202
00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:10.587
...he chained Prometheus
to a rock in the great Caucasus...

203
00:22:10.763 --> 00:22:15.257
...and each day, his eagle pecked out
the poor man's liver.

204
00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:20.031
Each night, it grew back again so that
it could be eaten the next day.

205
00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:22.300
Miserable fate.

206
00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:30.375
You remember Achilles.

207
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:33.075
-He's my favorite.
-Why?

208
00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:37.086
Because he loved Patroclus
and avenged his death.

209
00:22:37.256 --> 00:22:39.088
And his fate?

210
00:22:39.258 --> 00:22:42.489
That he must die young
but with great glory.

211
00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:44.322
Did he have a choice?

212
00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:48.933
Yes. He could live a long life,
but there would be no glory.

213
00:22:49.101 --> 00:22:53.299
You dream of glory, Alexander.
Your mother encourages you.

214
00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:57.773
There's no glory without suffering,
and this she will not allow.

215
00:23:03.983 --> 00:23:10.480
Oedipus tore out his eyes when he
found out he'd murdered his father...

216
00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:16.625
...and married his mother.
Knowledge that came too late.

217
00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:20.754
Medea, she slaughtered
her two children in vengeance...

218
00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:23.766
...when Jason left her for a younger wife.

219
00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:36.611
My mother would never hurt me.

220
00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:40.508
It's never easy to escape our mothers,
Alexander.

221
00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:47.583
All your life, beware of women.
They're far more dangerous than men.

222
00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:57.162
Herakles. Even after he accomplished
his 12 labors...

223
00:23:57.336 --> 00:24:02.035
...he was punished with madness,
slaughtered his three children.

224
00:24:03.342 --> 00:24:04.969
Poor Herakles.

225
00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.174
Great Herakles.

226
00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:11.846
All greatness comes from loss.

227
00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:18.218
Even you, the gods will
one day judge harshly.

228
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.256
When I'm king like you, Father?

229
00:24:20.426 --> 00:24:24.226
Don't rush the day, boy. You risk all.

230
00:24:25.364 --> 00:24:29.426
My father threw me into battle
before I knew how to fight.

231
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:32.161
When I killed my first man, he said:

232
00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:34.568
"Now you know."

233
00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:39.235
I hated him then,
but I understand why now.

234
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:41.743
A king isn't born, Alexander.

235
00:24:41.914 --> 00:24:45.976
He's made by steel and by suffering.

236
00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:51.185
A king must know
how to hurt those he loves.

237
00:24:54.994 --> 00:24:57.395
It's lonely. Ask Herakles.

238
00:24:58.464 --> 00:25:02.094
Ask any of them. Fate is cruel.

239
00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:08.800
No man or woman can be too powerful
or too beautiful without disaster befalling.

240
00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:15.471
They laugh when you rise too high and
crush everything you've built with a whim.

241
00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:20.109
What glory they give,
in the end, they take away.

242
00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:24.646
They make of us slaves.

243
00:25:43.575 --> 00:25:47.671
Perhaps Alexander's life was too favored.
Everything suddenly changed for him.

244
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.887
His father, King Philip, was murdered.

245
00:25:57.022 --> 00:26:00.856
And Alexander, at 20...

246
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.954
...became the new ruler of Macedonia.

247
00:26:06.465 --> 00:26:10.459
It was widely believed that
the great Persian king Darius...

248
00:26:10.636 --> 00:26:13.264
...had paid for the death of Philip.

249
00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:18.206
Announcing revenge, Alexander liberated
all of the cities of western Asia...

250
00:26:18.377 --> 00:26:21.278
...and provoked
Darius himself to battle...

251
00:26:21.447 --> 00:26:25.680
...in the heart of the Persian Empire,
near Babylon.

252
00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.982
It was mad.

253
00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:38.494
Forty thousand of us
against 250,000 barbarians.

254
00:26:38.664 --> 00:26:43.192
It was the day Alexander
had waited for all his life.

255
00:26:44.336 --> 00:26:49.331
In Egypt, an oracle in the desert had
declared Alexander the true son of Zeus.

256
00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:01.815
Alexander, son of a god.

257
00:27:02.488 --> 00:27:04.513
It was a myth, of course.

258
00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.182
At least it started as a myth.

259
00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.588
I know.

260
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.558
I was there.

261
00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:12.163
I saw his eyes.

262
00:27:12.598 --> 00:27:13.827
There.

263
00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:18.368
In the crack of the Persian line,
we'll go for the head.

264
00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:19.766
Kill Darius?

265
00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:23.101
The gods have brought him
to us at last.

266
00:27:24.076 --> 00:27:26.374
If I die, it's one Macedonian.

267
00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:29.173
But the Persians, they cannot move
without Darius' command.

268
00:27:29.348 --> 00:27:32.841
This is madness. You'll never get
within 100 paces of him.

269
00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:35.919
He's most protected at the center,
his best cavalry.

270
00:27:36.088 --> 00:27:38.250
Have you seen the sheer size
of his force?

271
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:43.389
Not if you hold them on the left,
my brave Parmenion...

272
00:27:43.562 --> 00:27:45.690
...with your son Philotas.

273
00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:48.092
If you grant me one hour...

274
00:27:48.267 --> 00:27:51.760
...pin them on the walls
of your sarissas...

275
00:27:51.937 --> 00:27:53.996
...then I and my cavalry will strike...

276
00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:57.404
...and deal the deathblow
to Darius' head.

277
00:27:57.576 --> 00:28:02.173
Since when, by the light of Apollo, has
cavalry been used to break an infantry line?

278
00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:03.872
Right.

279
00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:07.679
Alexander...

280
00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:09.947
...if we must fight...

281
00:28:10.122 --> 00:28:12.614
...do so with stealth.

282
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:17.160
Use your numbers well. We should attack
tonight when they least expect us.

283
00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:18.660
What?

284
00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:24.131
I didn't cross Asia
to steal this victory, Cassander.

285
00:28:24.303 --> 00:28:27.432
No, you are too honorable for that.

286
00:28:27.606 --> 00:28:32.840
No doubt influenced from sleeping
with Tales of Troy under your pillow.

287
00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:36.538
But your father
was no lover of Homer's.

288
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:40.813
Your father taught you never to surrender
your reason to your passion.

289
00:28:40.986 --> 00:28:43.284
Now I urge you, regroup.

290
00:28:43.922 --> 00:28:46.414
Fall back to the coast,
raise a larger force.

291
00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:50.529
I would, if I were Parmenion.

292
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.058
But I am Alexander.

293
00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:58.500
And no more than Earth has two suns
will Asia bear two kings.

294
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.399
These are my terms.

295
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:05.169
And if Darius isn't a coward
who hides behind his men...

296
00:29:05.344 --> 00:29:08.075
...then he'll come to me tomorrow.

297
00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:13.917
And when he bows down to Greece...

298
00:29:14.086 --> 00:29:16.851
...Alexander will be merciful.

299
00:29:20.292 --> 00:29:24.058
By Ares' chains, he's got balls, men.

300
00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:27.062
I mean, give the man his due,
Parmenion.

301
00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:34.835
And, lads, feast tonight,
for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.

302
00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:50.681
Blood makes the world rise.

303
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.283
Blood makes the rain fall.

304
00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.998
Blood makes the earth grow.

305
00:30:02.968 --> 00:30:09.465
And in blood, all men are born and die.

306
00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:16.943
Blood is the food of the gods below.

307
00:30:30.996 --> 00:30:34.660
Come, Bucephalus.
Today we ride to our destiny.

308
00:30:37.469 --> 00:30:41.463
Company, group! Regroup!

309
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.666
Phalanx, turn right!

310
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.459
Phalanx, attention!

311
00:31:27.853 --> 00:31:30.515
Neoptolemus.

312
00:31:30.689 --> 00:31:33.750
I remember you the day
you took the siege tower at Tyre.

313
00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:37.225
You were a giant.
And today, how will you fight?

314
00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:45.332
Dexippos, by Athena.

315
00:31:45.504 --> 00:31:49.668
How far was it you threw your man
wrestling at the last Olympic Games?

316
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:52.469
Will you match it with your spear?

317
00:31:56.982 --> 00:32:02.352
And Timander, son of Menander,
a great soldier to my father.

318
00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:07.254
I still mourn your brother, Addaios,
who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.

319
00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:11.021
What an honored family
you descend from, Timander.

320
00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:14.131
You fight for them today.

321
00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:21.631
You've all honored
your country and your ancestors.

322
00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:26.540
And now we come to this
most distant place in Asia...

323
00:32:26.878 --> 00:32:33.341
...where across from us, Darius
has at last gathered a vast army....

324
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.648
But ask yourselves, who is this great king
who pays assassins in gold coins...

325
00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:10.345
...to murder my father, our king...

326
00:33:10.522 --> 00:33:15.358
...in a most despicable
and cowardly manner?

327
00:33:15.527 --> 00:33:20.795
Who is this great king, Darius,
who enslaves his own men to fight?

328
00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:25.426
Who is this king but a king of air?

329
00:33:25.604 --> 00:33:28.835
These men do not fight for their homes.

330
00:33:29.007 --> 00:33:32.500
They fight because
this king tells them they must.

331
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:36.638
And when they fight,
they will melt away like the air...

332
00:33:36.815 --> 00:33:39.876
...because they know no loyalty
to a king of slaves.

333
00:33:40.986 --> 00:33:44.286
But we are not here today as slaves.

334
00:33:44.456 --> 00:33:46.584
We are here today...

335
00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:50.524
...as Macedonian freemen!

336
00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:06.908
Some of you...

337
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.981
...perhaps myself...

338
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:15.985
...will not live to see the sun set
over these mountains today.

339
00:34:16.922 --> 00:34:19.016
But I say to you...

340
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.093
...what every warrior has known
since the beginning of time.

341
00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:25.662
Conquer your fear...

342
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.289
...and I promise you,
you will conquer death.

343
00:34:52.324 --> 00:34:56.056
When they ask why you fought
so bravely, you will answer:

344
00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:59.128
"I was here this day at Gaugamela...

345
00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:03.567
...for the freedom...

346
00:35:04.703 --> 00:35:07.798
...and glory...

347
00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:12.208
...of Greece!"

348
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.412
Zeus be with us!

349
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.975
Cassander! Four columns, go!

350
00:35:57.389 --> 00:35:59.380
Where does he go?

351
00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:01.889
I don't know, Majesty.

352
00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.961
Envelop him, Bessus.

353
00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:11.728
Hephaistion, go!

354
00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:22.973
Phalanx!

355
00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:44.767
He makes a mistake, Pharnakes.

356
00:36:47.906 --> 00:36:49.465
Yes, great king.

357
00:37:52.003 --> 00:37:54.563
Be brave, men.

358
00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:57.166
Steady on the left, lads!

359
00:37:57.675 --> 00:38:00.235
Bend if you must, but never break.

360
00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:03.437
And keep watching the cavalry on the left.

361
00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:35.606
Pick up the pace!

362
00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:49.121
Prepare to repel chariots!

363
00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:16.504
Cassander!

364
00:40:16.681 --> 00:40:19.013
Forward, men!

365
00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:34.062
-Left turn!
-Infantry, clear! Out now!

366
00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:21.239
Hold your positions!

367
00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:24.211
Hold your positions!

368
00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:43.760
We must fall back to the gully, Father.

369
00:41:43.935 --> 00:41:45.425
No, hold.

370
00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:49.506
Where is he? We're far too thin!
Get word to Alexander!

371
00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:52.075
-Move!
-Yes, sir.

372
00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:14.155
Come, Macedonians! Ride! Ride!

373
00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:23.304
-Shields, break off!
-Break off.

374
00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:25.806
The shields are here!

375
00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:29.312
Drive for the hole!

376
00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:32.875
-Drive for the hole!
-Drive for the hole!

377
00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:19.395
Back and to the left!
Back and to the left!

378
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:24.424
-Philotas! Philotas!
-Father.

379
00:43:24.602 --> 00:43:26.661
Go. Tell Alexander yourself.

380
00:43:26.838 --> 00:43:32.777
And if he won't listen, then survive me
and avenge this betrayal!

381
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.057
Pay attention, lad!
Your father still watches over you!

382
00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.368
Darius!

383
00:44:38.543 --> 00:44:40.602
Find your horses.

384
00:44:56.394 --> 00:44:58.829
Darius!

385
00:45:19.584 --> 00:45:22.485
Go! Go!

386
00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:42.363
We can reach those mountains by sunset,
go all night and catch Darius at dawn.

387
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.566
Provision the horses.

388
00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:49.702
Alexander!
Alexander, my father's lost.

389
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.906
They've overrun the flank.
They're into the baggage train.

390
00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:55.212
Parmenion's crumbling.

391
00:45:55.386 --> 00:45:59.846
Alexander, if you chase him,
you risk losing your army here.

392
00:46:00.024 --> 00:46:03.483
And if we capture him,
we gain an empire.

393
00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:15.098
You can run to the ends of the earth,
you coward...

394
00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:18.265
...but you'll never run far enough!

395
00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.139
To Parmenion!

396
00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.124
You bleed free, my lord.

397
00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:46.669
-May I tend to your wound?
-No, Hermolaus, not now.

398
00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:49.067
There's far worse than me. Go to them.

399
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.038
Help them.

400
00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:21.901
-Your Majesty.
-You're very brave.

401
00:47:22.907 --> 00:47:24.705
What shall I call you?

402
00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:27.742
-Glaukos, my king.
-Glaukos.

403
00:47:28.813 --> 00:47:32.716
-And where's your home?
-lllyria.

404
00:47:33.818 --> 00:47:36.446
Let your body go loose.

405
00:47:37.722 --> 00:47:39.918
Think of home now.

406
00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:42.560
Be brave again, Glaukos...

407
00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:46.520
...and you will live on in glory.

408
00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:49.530
Alexander.

409
00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:05.545
The Persian Empire,
the greatest the world had yet known...

410
00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:07.912
...was destroyed.

411
00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:17.194
And Alexander, at 25,
was now king of all.

412
00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:23.996
Truth is in our hearts,
and none will tell you this but your father.

413
00:48:24.168 --> 00:48:27.138
Men hate the gods.

414
00:48:27.872 --> 00:48:32.469
The only reason we worship any of them
is because we fear worse.

415
00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.244
What's worse?

416
00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:37.211
Titans.

417
00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:40.009
If they were ever to be set free...

418
00:48:40.184 --> 00:48:43.484
...it would be a darkness
such as we have never seen.

419
00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:54.490
Can Zeus imprison the Titans forever
under Mount Olympus?

420
00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:59.831
It's said that when Zeus burned them
to dust with his lightning bolt...

421
00:49:00.004 --> 00:49:02.939
...they took the Titans' ashes
and, in a cold revenge...

422
00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:05.599
...mixed it with those of mortal men.

423
00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:07.505
Why?

424
00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:13.643
Who knows these things?

425
00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:16.085
One day...

426
00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:18.244
...things will change.

427
00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:20.413
Men will change.

428
00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:23.922
But first, the gods must change.

429
00:49:27.398 --> 00:49:30.390
But all this you'll forget, Alexander.

430
00:49:31.235 --> 00:49:33.465
That's why we call them myths.

431
00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:36.473
We can't bear to remember them.

432
00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:38.731
I'll remember.

433
00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:41.844
And one day, I'll be on walls like these.

434
00:49:50.054 --> 00:49:52.250
Alexander once said to me:

435
00:49:52.423 --> 00:49:56.883
“We are most alone
when we are with the myths."

436
00:49:58.128 --> 00:49:59.459
Phalanx!

437
00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:03.500
And thus, it came to pass in a dream...

438
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:07.626
...as mythical to all Greeks
as Achilles defeating the Trojans.

439
00:50:07.805 --> 00:50:11.002
At this one glorious moment in time...

440
00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:15.373
...Alexander was loved by all.

441
00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:22.343
But in the end, I believe Babylon
was a far easier mistress to enter...

442
00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.319
...than she was to leave.

443
00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:19.933
Sikander! Sikander!

444
00:51:43.968 --> 00:51:49.407
Aristotle may have called them barbarians,
but he never saw Babylon.

445
00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:54.409
We have enough gold here to support
three generations of Macedonian armies.

446
00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:57.343
And Macedonia would soon corrupt,
Cassander.

447
00:51:57.548 --> 00:52:02.213
-Wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
-Not for the men who fought, I trust.

448
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:07.184
We'll pay them well, Antigonus,
but not as mercenaries for future services.

449
00:52:07.358 --> 00:52:09.019
Now you sound like Philip.

450
00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.858
Philip never saw Babylon.

451
00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.520
No, he didn't, Hephaistion.

452
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.362
-Hello!
-Hello!

453
00:52:18.669 --> 00:52:22.071
Alexander, I know you think me
a stiff old sod...

454
00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:24.765
...but whatever our differences,
know this day...

455
00:52:24.942 --> 00:52:28.469
...your father would be very proud of you.

456
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:31.974
Thank you, Parmenion.

457
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:37.312
I ask you to forgive me
my own anger, my pride.

458
00:52:37.488 --> 00:52:39.684
They, too, blind me.

459
00:52:44.428 --> 00:52:48.092
Yes, the grandsons of goat herders...

460
00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:51.257
...we now rule 2 million square miles.

461
00:52:51.435 --> 00:52:54.894
Not if you keep giving it all away.

462
00:52:55.673 --> 00:53:01.112
None of you fear that this great fortune
may drive us all to destruction.

463
00:53:01.512 --> 00:53:03.310
You overvalue us.

464
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.144
For as long as Darius breathes,
he is the legitimate king of Asia...

465
00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:09.649
...and I but the king of air.

466
00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:14.883
But he has no power, Alexander.
He's lost in the mountains with no army.

467
00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:18.461
As long as he's lost, Philotas,
he can be believed in.

468
00:53:18.629 --> 00:53:21.963
Only when he's found will it be decided.

469
00:53:23.634 --> 00:53:25.796
It seems you've already
made up your mind.

470
00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:28.904
We must finish what we failed
to do at Gaugamela.

471
00:53:29.073 --> 00:53:30.905
We must hunt Darius down.

472
00:53:31.075 --> 00:53:34.534
-That was not your father's mission.
-And I am not my father.

473
00:53:37.181 --> 00:53:39.741
Come on. Have you so quickly forgotten?

474
00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:40.975
Fortune favors the bold.

475
00:53:45.756 --> 00:53:48.748
No wonder Darius fled
when he had this to come back to.

476
00:53:48.926 --> 00:53:52.521
One for every night of the year.

477
00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:20.655
How will I go back to Lysimache
after this?

478
00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:25.762
I advise you not to touch, Leonnatus.
Here, I'll take care of it for you.

479
00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.624
Apologies.

480
00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:04.562
Aristotle was perhaps prescient.

481
00:55:06.003 --> 00:55:10.440
Do these images fool us with their beauty
and degrade our souls?

482
00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:31.051
Great King Alexander.

483
00:55:33.764 --> 00:55:35.960
The princess of the thousand roses...

484
00:55:36.133 --> 00:55:39.364
...and eldest daughter of the formerly
Great King Darius...

485
00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.596
...Stateira.

486
00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:44.934
Noble Alexander...

487
00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:55.076
...I come to beg for the lives...

488
00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:57.112
...of my sisters...

489
00:55:58.155 --> 00:56:01.056
...my mother, my grandmother.

490
00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:09.758
You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.

491
00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:12.061
He, too, is Alexander.

492
00:56:15.873 --> 00:56:17.102
Please.

493
00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:21.736
I plead for my family's lives.

494
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:26.175
-Sell me as a slave, great king, but--
-Look now...

495
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:28.478
...in my eyes...

496
00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:30.915
...princess...

497
00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:34.549
...and tell me...

498
00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:37.285
...how would you like to be treated?

499
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.858
As I am...

500
00:56:42.032 --> 00:56:44.091
...a princess.

501
00:56:47.304 --> 00:56:49.102
Then so be it.

502
00:56:50.841 --> 00:56:53.867
You and your family shall
be treated as my family.

503
00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:59.709
You shall live in this palace
as long as you choose.

504
00:57:00.117 --> 00:57:03.781
Have you any other requests for me,
my noble princess?

505
00:57:06.323 --> 00:57:07.916
No.

506
00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:11.987
Everything I wish...

507
00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:15.063
...I have requested.

508
00:57:15.966 --> 00:57:17.832
You truly are...

509
00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:19.298
...a queen.

510
00:57:26.243 --> 00:57:29.008
Yes, she would be
a perfect match for you...

511
00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.546
...but you do nothing.

512
00:57:31.949 --> 00:57:35.317
Three months you've been in Babylon
and leave me in Pella...

513
00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:39.319
...at the mercy of your enemies,
of which you have many.

514
00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:43.221
Antipater, accustomed now to the power
that you have given him.

515
00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.919
I must watch him grow stronger.

516
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:58.131
I'm certain that he communicates secretly
with Parmenion, who is dangerous.

517
00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:01.334
But beware, most of all,
of those closest to you.

518
00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.007
They are like snakes...

519
00:58:04.081 --> 00:58:05.480
...and can be turned.

520
00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:07.276
General Crateros.

521
00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.850
Cassander is Antipater's son.

522
00:58:14.024 --> 00:58:17.619
Even Cleitus, your father's favorite...

523
00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:20.820
...and Ptolemy, your friend, yes.

524
00:58:20.998 --> 00:58:23.228
But beware of men who think too much.

525
00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.728
They blind themselves.

526
00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:27.996
Only Hephaistion do I leave out.

527
00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.966
But all of them you make rich...

528
00:58:31.141 --> 00:58:36.944
...while your mother and yourself,
you leave in generous poverty.

529
00:58:37.748 --> 00:58:40.843
Why won't you ever believe me?

530
00:58:41.018 --> 00:58:46.684
It is only a dark mind like mine
that can know these secrets of the heart.

531
00:58:46.857 --> 00:58:49.758
For they are dark, Alexander.

532
00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:52.327
So dark.

533
00:58:52.496 --> 00:58:53.964
But in you...

534
00:58:54.798 --> 00:58:57.665
...lies the light of the world.

535
00:58:57.834 --> 00:59:01.862
Your companions will be shadows
in the underworld...

536
00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:06.408
...when you are a name living forever
in history as the most glorious...

537
00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:10.979
...shining light of youth, forever young,
forever inspiring.

538
00:59:11.148 --> 00:59:14.675
Never will there be an Alexander like you.

539
00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:17.786
Alexander the Great.

540
00:59:18.622 --> 00:59:22.149
Remember, bring me to Babylon
as you promised.

541
00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:25.522
I can only help you, for they know
if they harm you...

542
00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:29.962
...they will face my wrath,
as Queen of Babylon.

543
00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:35.096
It's a high ransom she charges
for nine months' lodging in the womb.

544
00:59:35.272 --> 00:59:37.263
Bring her, Alexander.

545
00:59:37.441 --> 00:59:40.570
-It'll give her such joy.
-Joy?

546
00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:44.609
When I'm the cracked mirror
of her dreams?

547
01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:04.692
The generals question your obsession
with Darius.

548
01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:08.031
They say it was never meant
for you to be king of Asia.

549
01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:09.730
Naturally.

550
01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:14.241
They want only to return to their homes,
rich with gold. But I've seen the future.

551
01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:17.711
I've seen it now 1000 times,
on 1000 faces.

552
01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:20.009
These people want....

553
01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:23.116
Need change.

554
01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:26.054
Look at those we've conquered.

555
01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.248
They leave their dead unburied.

556
01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:31.528
They smash their enemies' skulls
and drink them as dust.

557
01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:33.686
They mate in public.

558
01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:38.734
What can they think or sing or write
when none can read?

559
01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:43.533
But as Alexander's army, they can go
where they never thought possible.

560
01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:46.768
They can soldier or work in the cities.

561
01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:51.141
The Alexandrias,
from Egypt to the outer ocean.

562
01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.583
We could connect these lands,
Hephaistion...

563
01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:55.980
...and the people.

564
01:00:56.153 --> 01:01:01.785
Some say these Alexandrias have become
extensions of Alexander himself.

565
01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.621
They draw people into the cities
to make slaves of them.

566
01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:11.063
But we freed them, Hephaistion, from
the Persia where everyone lived as slaves.

567
01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:15.333
To free the people of the world...

568
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:20.102
...such would be beyond the glory
of Achilles, beyond Herakles...

569
01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:22.905
...a feat to rival Prometheus...

570
01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:26.375
...who was always a friend to man.

571
01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.917
Remember the fates of these heroes.

572
01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:33.283
-They suffered greatly.
-We all suffer.

573
01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:37.284
Your father, mine.

574
01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:40.153
They all came to the end of their time.

575
01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:44.392
And in the end, when it's over,
all that matters is what you've done.

576
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:50.503
You once said,
"The fear of death drives all men."

577
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.865
Are there no other forces?

578
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.880
Is there not love in your life...

579
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.206
...Alexander?

580
01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:12.358
I wonder sometimes if it's not
your mother you run from.

581
01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:17.728
So many years,
so many miles between you.

582
01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.093
What is it you fear?

583
01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:24.870
Who knows these things?

584
01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:31.573
When I was a child, my mother thought
me divine. My father, weak.

585
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.812
Which am I, Hephaistion?

586
01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:39.115
Weak or divine?

587
01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.792
All I know is...

588
01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.021
...l trust only you in this world.

589
01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.731
It is you I love, Hephaistion.

590
01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.098
No other.

591
01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:02.577
You're everything I care for...

592
01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:06.410
...and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite...

593
01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:10.079
...I'm so jealous of losing you
to this world you want.

594
01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.249
You'll never lose me, Hephaistion.

595
01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:17.526
I'll be with you always.

596
01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:19.628
Till the end.

597
01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.537
The campaign in the northeast of Persia...

598
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:39.945
...turned into a hard guerrilla war
of almost three years.

599
01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:52.226
He was dying when we found him, sire.

600
01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:54.295
He asked for water.

601
01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:56.831
He drank and died.

602
01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:08.205
The Great King Darius had been betrayed
by his own commanders.

603
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:36.762
Fully honoring his corpse...

604
01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:42.276
...Alexander hunted down
these commanders into unknown lands...

605
01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:47.648
...crossing even beyond
the River Oxus into Sogdia.

606
01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:57.891
We fought them as far as
the unknown steppes of Scythia...

607
01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:01.326
...where only legendary heroes
had once trod.

608
01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:05.091
Here, Alexander founded
his 10th Alexandria...

609
01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:07.760
...and settled it with veterans.

610
01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:12.533
Unable to accept defeat in any form...

611
01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:17.112
...Alexander persisted in breaking
every tribe that resisted.

612
01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:26.315
For Alexander, there could be
no pretender to the throne of Asia...

613
01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:31.159
...which now included all
of Sogdia and Bactria.

614
01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:02.985
Her eyes tell me
she cares for you, Alexander.

615
01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:05.986
Perhaps too much.

616
01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.850
In the ways of my country...

617
01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:15.726
...those who love too much
lose everything...

618
01:07:15.899 --> 01:07:18.994
...and those who love with irony...

619
01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:21.770
...last.

620
01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:38.779
Your father must be turning in his grave.
After all this, a hill chief's daughter.

621
01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:41.253
By Athena's justice, this girl has spirit.

622
01:07:42.859 --> 01:07:46.295
But what's the point, Alexander?
Just take her as your concubine.

623
01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:49.295
Because I want a son.
Damn you, Philotas.

624
01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:54.497
Then half your nobles have sisters
who'd make fine Macedonian mothers.

625
01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:58.665
To take an Asian as my queen,
not a captive, is a sign of deep respect.

626
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.003
It will bring us together, unify us.

627
01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.646
Which is not to say I won't take
a Macedonian.

628
01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:08.341
-As a second wife? You insult Macedonia.
-Alexander!

629
01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:11.480
This is about the honor of our kingdom.

630
01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.918
Exactly. What can be won, Alexander?

631
01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.617
We're in Asia to punish them
for their crimes. We've achieved that.

632
01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:21.389
Seven years from home, now we drift
from one far region to another...

633
01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:25.467
...chasing nomads and bandits
when Macedonia bleeds its manpower.

634
01:08:25.635 --> 01:08:27.694
For what? To build roads in Asia?

635
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.032
To give these people cities?

636
01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:33.608
To found cities and expand
our reach is not to drift.

637
01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.177
-What benefit to Macedon?
-It's far richer!

638
01:08:36.346 --> 01:08:38.576
-Look what you give them.
-With respect...

639
01:08:38.748 --> 01:08:42.582
...had you fought better at Gaugamela
when your flank was crumbling--

640
01:08:42.752 --> 01:08:46.086
-How dare you, Nearchus?!
-General Nearchus to you, boy.

641
01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:49.748
Alexander spread our flank too thin!
There was nothing my father...

642
01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:52.258
-...or any of you could've done!
-Philotas!

643
01:08:58.201 --> 01:09:00.829
Alexander, I've known you
since you were born.

644
01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:04.496
I supported you at your father's death.

645
01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:07.575
At the very least, for Zeus' sake...

646
01:09:07.744 --> 01:09:10.714
...and in respect to the council
that chose you king...

647
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.974
...give us a Macedonian heir.

648
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.844
A Macedonian heir.

649
01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:23.249
-You've been heard clearly.
-But--

650
01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:28.990
Parmenion! After the wedding, take two
brigades to Babylon, where I look to you...

651
01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:34.296
...and Antipater in Greece, to maintain
our empire and supply this expedition.

652
01:09:34.771 --> 01:09:36.865
I'll winter with my army at Marakand.

653
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.977
I pray to Apollo you realize how far
you've turned from your father's path.

654
01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:43.977
Damn you, Parmenion,
by the gods and your Apollo.

655
01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:47.640
What was in my father's guts
wasn't overripe in reason like yours!

656
01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:51.412
He never lusted for war, Alexander,
or enjoyed it so.

657
01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:56.684
He consulted his peers in council,
among equals, the Macedonian way.

658
01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:59.556
He didn't decide based
on his personal desires.

659
01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:03.063
I've taken us further
than my father ever dreamed.

660
01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:04.529
Old man...

661
01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.363
...we're in new worlds.

662
01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:11.769
Alexander, be reasonable!

663
01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:14.376
Were they ever meant to be our equals?

664
01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.410
Share our rewards?

665
01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:18.707
You remember what Aristotle said.

666
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.212
An Asian?

667
01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:24.149
What would a vow mean to a race
that's never kept their word to a Greek?

668
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.414
-Aristotle be damned!
-Alexander!

669
01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:28.079
By Zeus and all the gods...

670
01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:32.387
...what makes you so much better
than them, Cassander?

671
01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:38.001
Better than you really are.
In you and those like you is this.

672
01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:40.233
Alexander.

673
01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:47.604
What disturbs me most is not your lack
of respect for my judgment.

674
01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:53.377
It's your contempt for a world
far older than ours.

675
01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:09.923
And so the most powerful man in the world
took a girl of no political significance.

676
01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.760
Through our union...

677
01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.835
...Greek and barbarian...

678
01:11:15.004 --> 01:11:16.995
...may be reconciled in peace.

679
01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:24.805
Why?

680
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:30.078
On this glorious occasion...

681
01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:33.223
...I toast this great army
that has given so much.

682
01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:37.485
And in honor of them, those of you
who set out with us seven long years ago...

683
01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:43.895
...I pronounce all your debts paid forthwith
from the royal treasury.

684
01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:45.496
Praise Alexander!

685
01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:51.666
And in honor of my bride...

686
01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:57.736
...my beautiful bride...

687
01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:02.476
...we recognize the many women
who've shared the long road with us...

688
01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:06.145
...and grant them dowries
befitting a proper marriage.

689
01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:12.891
And what about our boys?

690
01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:14.552
And lastly...

691
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.995
...lastly, the gods demand no less of us...

692
01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:21.501
...that your children be given
a proper Greek education...

693
01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:26.268
...and military training
under our protection...

694
01:12:26.442 --> 01:12:30.675
...s0 as to be the new soldiers
of our kingdom...

695
01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:33.316
...in Asia.

696
01:13:15.858 --> 01:13:17.451
I found it in Egypt.

697
01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:22.488
The man who sold it said it came
from a time...

698
01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:27.034
...when man worshipped sun and stars.

699
01:13:32.308 --> 01:13:34.572
I'll always think of you...

700
01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:37.676
...as the sun, Alexander.

701
01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:42.011
And I pray your dream
will shine on all men.

702
01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.161
I wish you a son.

703
01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:57.065
You're a great man.

704
01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:04.669
Many will love you, Alexander,
but none so pure and deep....

705
01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:22.791
You...

706
01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.654
...love him?

707
01:14:33.536 --> 01:14:36.562
He is Hephaistion.

708
01:14:50.286 --> 01:14:53.779
There are many different ways
to love, Roxane.

709
01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.382
Come.

710
01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:10.868
No.

711
01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.633
No, no.

712
01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.476
You have no fear.

713
01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:57.716
It's fitting.

714
01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:02.481
A man searches for a woman
at Earth's top...

715
01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:04.626
...and finds her.

716
01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:20.738
You will have my son.

717
01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:35.810
Who is this woman you call
vour queen, Alexander?

718
01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:38.786
Do not confuse us.

719
01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:42.822
I was never a barbarian as Philip said.

720
01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:45.757
We are of Achilles' royal blood.

721
01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:49.488
Zeus is your father.

722
01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:54.725
Oh, I understand she brings
you some happiness...

723
01:17:54.904 --> 01:17:56.633
...but hear me when I tell you...

724
01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:59.035
...act and act soon.

725
01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:01.199
After seven years, people wonder:

726
01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.675
"Who is this King Alexander?"

727
01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:09.649
I have given you ample proof.
Antipater daily undermines your authority.

728
01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:12.913
Return to Babylon
and strengthen your center.

729
01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.850
Or come home to Macedonia
and reorganize.

730
01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:18.551
But do not chase your dream...

731
01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.786
...further east.

732
01:18:20.963 --> 01:18:24.763
Your life and mine depend on it.

733
01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:27.329
Remember...

734
01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:31.201
...my only thoughts are of you.

735
01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:35.674
As you, too, must face
your glorious destiny.

736
01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.938
Think kindly of your mother.

737
01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:39.672
Provide for me.

738
01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:43.443
Protect me from your enemies
when you are gone.

739
01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:47.481
And remember always...

740
01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:51.217
...itis I who love you more than any.

741
01:18:57.499 --> 01:19:00.730
If only you were not a pale reflection...

742
01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:02.393
...of my mother's heart.

743
01:19:22.358 --> 01:19:25.885
Pregnant so soon. The little whore.

744
01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:30.191
He will marry her in the spring,
during Dionysus' Festival...

745
01:19:30.366 --> 01:19:33.063
...and when her first son is born...

746
01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:38.730
...her sweet uncle Attalus will convince
Philip to name the boy his successor...

747
01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:41.308
...with himself as regent.

748
01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:43.536
And you...

749
01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:47.740
...you will be sent on
some impossible mission...

750
01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:50.476
...against some monstrous Northern tribe...

751
01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:56.114
...to be mutilated in one more
meaningless battle over cattle.

752
01:19:56.292 --> 01:20:00.160
And I, no longer queen,
will be put to death...

753
01:20:00.329 --> 01:20:04.391
...with your sister and the remaining
members of our family.

754
01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:09.299
I wish sometimes you could see
the light, Mother.

755
01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:14.238
The truth is, he's taken nothing from you
that you've not been long without.

756
01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:18.179
The only way is to strike.

757
01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:21.112
Announce your marriage
to a Macedonian now.

758
01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:25.985
Beget a child of pure blood. He would
be one of them, not mine...

759
01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:29.557
...and he would have no choice
but to make you king.

760
01:20:29.725 --> 01:20:31.819
There is still Kynnane.

761
01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:37.498
Eurydice was perfect. If your father,
that pig, had not ravaged her first!

762
01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:40.499
Say nothing more of my father.

763
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:43.604
Do you hear me? Say nothing.

764
01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.201
You're right.

765
01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:49.270
Forgive me.

766
01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:52.278
A mother loves too much.

767
01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:01.115
Who shall I sing to sleep
at night anymore?

768
01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:11.222
I wish-- I wish we could spend
more time together.

769
01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:16.427
Like we used to, when you were
the sweetest boy.

770
01:21:21.777 --> 01:21:23.836
There's never been time, Mother.

771
01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:29.618
Since I was a child, I've been groomed
to be ever the best.

772
01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:35.079
My poor child, you're like Achilles...

773
01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:37.726
...cursed by your greatness.

774
01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:44.332
Take my strength.

775
01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:56.535
You must never confuse your feelings
with your duties, Alexander.

776
01:21:58.013 --> 01:22:02.575
A king must make public gestures
for the common people.

777
01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:06.187
I know, but you will be 19 this summer...

778
01:22:06.355 --> 01:22:11.054
...and the girls already say you don't
like them. You like Hephaistion more.

779
01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:14.662
I understand.
It's natural for a young man.

780
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:19.028
But if you go to Asia without leaving
your successor, you risk all.

781
01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:25.402
Hephaistion loves me,
as I am...

782
01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:26.939
...not who.

783
01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:31.903
Loves? Loves?

784
01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:36.476
In the name of Dionysus...

785
01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:43.554
...understand how Philip thinks,
for your own sake.

786
01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:47.787
Your life hangs in the balance.

787
01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:52.901
-His spies are inside your closest circle.
-Stop!

788
01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:58.037
I'm his only worthy son.

789
01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:00.107
You crazed woman.

790
01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:03.235
He'd never hurt me.

791
01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:09.112
Even if Eurydice had a boy,
he'd be 20 before he'd let him rule.

792
01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:12.686
Yes, and you would be 40.

793
01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:19.261
Old and wise like Parmenion.
And Philip's young son would be 20.

794
01:23:19.428 --> 01:23:25.800
Like you now,
but raised by him, his blood.

795
01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:29.429
He will never give you
the throne now, Alexander.

796
01:23:29.905 --> 01:23:31.464
Never.

797
01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:35.836
What would you have me do?

798
01:23:36.612 --> 01:23:39.343
Whatever is necessary.

799
01:23:42.718 --> 01:23:45.483
Where have you lost your mind?

800
01:23:45.921 --> 01:23:48.322
It would be civil war,
clan against clan, chaos.

801
01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:51.391
Yes. And you would win.

802
01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.188
Because the young ones
love you like a god.

803
01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:56.661
I forbid you to ever talk to me like that!

804
01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:00.066
Such a man would be forever chased
by the Furies!

805
01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:03.830
What have you to fear from the Furies...

806
01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:07.203
...for killing an impostor to the throne...

807
01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:10.971
...before he murders you
and your mother?

808
01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:13.808
Why won't you ever believe me?

809
01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:17.612
Philip did not want you.

810
01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:20.245
You had a condition of the breathing...

811
01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:22.948
...and he wanted to leave you
in the mountains...

812
01:24:23.125 --> 01:24:25.992
...for the birds to peck at your eyes.

813
01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:27.856
No, Alexander...

814
01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:32.125
...2eus is your father.

815
01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:37.671
I laid with him that night in the wind,
as sure as any mortal man.

816
01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:41.400
Never have I been made love to
as I was then.

817
01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:42.976
Enough.

818
01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:47.612
Half the mothers in Greece
share such a fantasy.

819
01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:50.151
I warn you, Mother.

820
01:24:50.319 --> 01:24:52.447
Make no mistake.

821
01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:57.882
You will treat this girl as nothing
more important than his other wives.

822
01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:01.552
You will behave as we always have.

823
01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.459
As the first.

824
01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.775
I wonder...

825
01:25:17.079 --> 01:25:18.604
...did you ever love him?

826
01:25:22.351 --> 01:25:23.944
What?

827
01:25:26.755 --> 01:25:28.519
I never stopped.

828
01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:02.957
Who did this?

829
01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.294
-Tell me.
-Hermolaus!

830
01:26:13.869 --> 01:26:17.772
Death to all tyrants.

831
01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:20.803
Yes, I've been arrogant...

832
01:26:20.976 --> 01:26:24.071
...I'm hotheaded,
and I've made enemies...

833
01:26:24.246 --> 01:26:26.943
...but do you really, in your heart...

834
01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:30.881
...think that I would use seven silly boys
who would then come to me...

835
01:26:31.053 --> 01:26:34.318
...as one has said, and tell me
of their plot...

836
01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:37.254
...as if I were an outsider?

837
01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:39.590
Alexander.

838
01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:42.656
Remember me for who I am.

839
01:26:43.432 --> 01:26:46.663
I do remember you, Philotas,
but not as you remember yourself.

840
01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:51.033
It appears to me and your peers that
the true weather of your soul is ambition.

841
01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:52.696
No.

842
01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.569
I didn't do this!

843
01:26:54.743 --> 01:26:55.972
Cleitus!

844
01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:57.976
-Remove him now. Remove him.
-No!

845
01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:00.672
-No, Alexander, no!
-Remove him.

846
01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:14.751
-Which one of us has to do it?
-It's the only way to spare the life--

847
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.898
How many of them?

848
01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:22.702
Crateros, what of his 20,000 men?

849
01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:24.405
They'll be divided.

850
01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:28.066
-The men will follow their king.
-Alexander won't be there.

851
01:27:30.112 --> 01:27:32.809
The infantry will follow me.

852
01:27:41.223 --> 01:27:45.160
Then go, Antigonus, and Cleitus.

853
01:27:45.327 --> 01:27:47.193
And go quickly.

854
01:28:40.382 --> 01:28:44.376
If we issue the gold bullion in the name
of Alexander then we meet a resistance.

855
01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:47.318
Cleitus. Antigonus.

856
01:28:47.489 --> 01:28:49.116
Parmenion.

857
01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:07.330
Come, Alexander,
drink this sadness away.

858
01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:09.903
If only thirst could quench sorrow,
Ptolemy.

859
01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:17.568
There's only one thing better
than winning a battle, son...

860
01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:21.012
...and that's the taste of a new woman.

861
01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:26.211
You'll find it far sweeter than self-pity.

862
01:30:26.388 --> 01:30:28.254
Pausanias, you bore me.

863
01:30:28.423 --> 01:30:30.551
Alexander, I found you the right girl.

864
01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:33.023
I love you, my little imp.

865
01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:35.961
And I love you, Cleitus.

866
01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:38.658
-Please, no!
-There you go.

867
01:30:44.339 --> 01:30:45.864
Pausanias.

868
01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:48.167
Who's your new friend?

869
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:51.072
-There's your new friend.
-Please don't!

870
01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:56.751
A toast.

871
01:30:56.918 --> 01:30:58.249
A toast!

872
01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:04.448
I drink to our Greek friends
and to our new union...

873
01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:10.531
...Macedonia and Greece,
equals in greatness!

874
01:31:13.001 --> 01:31:19.498
And to Philip, our king, without whom
this union could not be possible.

875
01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:22.644
Come, Attalus, leave some
damn air in the hall!

876
01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:30.107
And last, I drink to the king's marriage
to my niece, Eurydice...

877
01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:33.311
...a Macedonian queen we can be proud of!

878
01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:39.624
To Philip and Eurydice...

879
01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.923
...and to their legitimate sons!

880
01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:46.298
Alexander, don't!

881
01:31:46.468 --> 01:31:49.438
What am I, you son of a dog?
Come, then.

882
01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:04.544
-Shut up.
-Shut up.

883
01:32:04.719 --> 01:32:06.653
Shut up, all of you!

884
01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:09.648
This is my wedding,
not some public brawl.

885
01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:11.815
Insolent pup.

886
01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:15.224
Apologize, by Zeus,
before you dishonor me.

887
01:32:15.397 --> 01:32:18.799
You defend the man who called
my mother a whore and me a bastard.

888
01:32:18.967 --> 01:32:22.164
-And I dishonor you?
-You listen like your mother.

889
01:32:22.337 --> 01:32:24.533
Attalus is my family now,
the same as you.

890
01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:27.334
Then choose your relatives
more carefully.

891
01:32:27.509 --> 01:32:30.706
Don't expect me to sit here
and watch you shame yourself.

892
01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:33.871
-You insult me!
-I insult you!

893
01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:37.144
A man not fit to lick the ground
my mother walks on.

894
01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:40.219
-You dog, questioning your queen.
-Shame?

895
01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:44.222
I've nothing to be ashamed of,
you arrogant brat.

896
01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:48.226
I'll marry the girl if I want,
and I'll have as many sons as I want.

897
01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.922
There's nothing you
or your harpy mother can do.

898
01:32:51.099 --> 01:32:53.033
Why, drunken man, must you think...

899
01:32:53.201 --> 01:32:55.693
...everything I do and say
comes from my mother?

900
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:58.805
Because I know her heart, by Hera...

901
01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:01.169
...and I see her in your eyes.

902
01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:03.777
You covet this throne too much.

903
01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:10.516
We all know that she-wolf
of a mother of yours wants me dead.

904
01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:12.983
Well, you can both dream, boy.

905
01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:16.283
Philip, this is the wine talking.
Leave the boy. It'll wait.

906
01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:18.017
Now!

907
01:33:19.194 --> 01:33:21.094
I command you.

908
01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:25.397
Apologize to your kinsman.

909
01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:34.770
Apologize.

910
01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:37.503
No kinsman to me.

911
01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:43.017
Good night, old man.

912
01:33:44.486 --> 01:33:48.946
And when my mother remarries,
I'll invite you to her wedding.

913
01:33:49.524 --> 01:33:51.458
You bastard!

914
01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.927
You'll obey me. Come here.

915
01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:21.949
And this is the man who is going
to take you from Greece to Persia?

916
01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:24.649
He can't even make it
from one couch to the next.

917
01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:28.888
Get out of my palace!
You're exiled, you bastard!

918
01:34:29.531 --> 01:34:32.967
Banished from the land.
You're not welcome here.

919
01:34:33.902 --> 01:34:36.098
You're no son of mine!

920
01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:24.010
In the spring, Alexander marched
an army of 150,000...

921
01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:27.246
...across the passes of the Hindu Kush...

922
01:35:27.789 --> 01:35:29.780
...into the unknown.

923
01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:35.860
In his dream, it was the promised route
to the end of the world.

924
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:37.930
We were now a mobile empire...

925
01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:41.967
...stretching back thousands of miles
to Greece.

926
01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:45.037
Cooks and architects,
doctors and surveyors...

927
01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:46.674
...moneylenders and wives...

928
01:35:46.841 --> 01:35:49.708
...children, lovers, whores.

929
01:35:49.877 --> 01:35:51.436
And slaves...

930
01:35:51.613 --> 01:35:56.483
...that anonymous, bent, working spine
of this new beast.

931
01:35:56.651 --> 01:36:00.485
Ravaged or expanded, for better or worse...

932
01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:05.953
...no occupied territory
remained the same again.

933
01:36:09.297 --> 01:36:11.425
Although devoted to Roxane...

934
01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:14.728
...Alexander's visits
to her tent diminished...

935
01:36:14.902 --> 01:36:19.863
...as a year, then two, went by
without a successor...

936
01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:23.903
...wounding Alexander's great pride.

937
01:36:24.245 --> 01:36:27.840
The surveyors are saying that Zeus
chained Prometheus up there.

938
01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:30.348
In one of those caves.

939
01:36:31.219 --> 01:36:33.950
They say there's a giant eagle's nest
just above it.

940
01:36:34.255 --> 01:36:39.056
I suppose he drops down each night
to peck out poor Prometheus' liver.

941
01:36:41.696 --> 01:36:45.155
You remember what Aristotle told us
of these mountains?

942
01:36:46.034 --> 01:36:47.627
Yes, I do.

943
01:36:48.503 --> 01:36:50.597
That when we reach these heights...

944
01:36:50.772 --> 01:36:53.969
...we'd look back and see Macedonia
to the west...

945
01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:56.770
...and the outer ocean to the east.

946
01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:05.843
But I fear this world is far larger
than anyone dreamed.

947
01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.182
A world of Titans.

948
01:37:08.356 --> 01:37:12.350
The scouts have been up
every known trail, Alexander.

949
01:37:12.527 --> 01:37:14.757
There is no way across.

950
01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:19.494
Except to the south, into India.

951
01:37:19.901 --> 01:37:22.962
Were we gods, we'd breach
these walls to the eastern ocean.

952
01:37:23.805 --> 01:37:25.500
We will, Alexander.

953
01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:28.335
In a few years' time, we will return.

954
01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:32.309
But first, the men must see their homes.

955
01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:35.806
Have you found your home...

956
01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:37.678
...Ptolemy?

957
01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:45.554
More and more, I think
it will be Alexandria.

958
01:37:47.662 --> 01:37:49.824
Well, at least it's hot.

959
01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:52.561
And Thais...

960
01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:55.493
...she loved it there.

961
01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:59.535
Women bring men home.

962
01:38:00.641 --> 01:38:05.545
-I have no such feeling.
-You have Babylon, Alexander.

963
01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:07.875
Where your mother awaits your invitation.

964
01:38:08.316 --> 01:38:10.808
Yes, I have Babylon.

965
01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:15.354
But each land, each boundary I cross...

966
01:38:15.523 --> 01:38:17.855
...I strip away another illusion.

967
01:38:19.227 --> 01:38:21.559
I sense death will be the last.

968
01:38:24.298 --> 01:38:27.757
Yet still I push harder and harder...

969
01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:31.496
...to reach this home.

970
01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:38.443
Where has our eagle gone?

971
01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:45.211
We must go on, Ptolemy.

972
01:38:46.521 --> 01:38:48.182
Until we find an end.

973
01:38:56.597 --> 01:39:00.329
India, the land where the sun was born...

974
01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:03.095
...fabled to be even richer than Persia...

975
01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:07.333
...had never been explored or conquered.

976
01:39:09.710 --> 01:39:15.046
From the beginning, Alexander struggled
to unify a land without a center.

977
01:39:15.216 --> 01:39:17.947
Kings who conspired against one another.

978
01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:22.181
A labyrinth of tribes urged on
by zealots and philosophers...

979
01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:26.554
...to die by the thousands
for their strange gods.

980
01:39:28.596 --> 01:39:30.792
-Shoot the trees!
-Look out!

981
01:39:35.203 --> 01:39:37.672
They're animals, they live in trees.

982
01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:40.600
Keep that away from me.

983
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:51.241
Look, Roxane.

984
01:39:52.954 --> 01:39:54.183
Hello, little man.

985
01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:57.518
-Do they speak?
-No, but they do sing.

986
01:39:59.794 --> 01:40:02.525
And then, there was the rain.

987
01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:08.497
Never before had we seen water
that fell from the gods...

988
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:11.331
...for 60 days and nights.

989
01:40:14.275 --> 01:40:16.107
You know better, Machatas.

990
01:40:16.444 --> 01:40:17.969
What's your son going to say?

991
01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:22.306
Watch out for the serpent.

992
01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.946
Hold it, hold it tight.

993
01:40:28.256 --> 01:40:30.987
Cleitus, bring the snake healers!

994
01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:34.093
-Pauvanus. Someone bring Pauvanus.
-Where's the bite?

995
01:40:34.262 --> 01:40:35.991
-What happened?
-It's to the neck.

996
01:40:36.163 --> 01:40:38.495
Oh, no. Zeus, no.

997
01:40:38.666 --> 01:40:40.225
Hold on. Hold on.

998
01:40:40.401 --> 01:40:41.732
Be brave.

999
01:40:41.903 --> 01:40:43.598
Be brave.

1000
01:40:43.771 --> 01:40:45.739
Oh, Zeus.

1001
01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:49.837
Our quest for gold and glory evaporated
as we realized...

1002
01:40:50.011 --> 01:40:52.343
...there was none to be had.

1003
01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:54.645
Tempers worsened.

1004
01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:57.577
And with the local water putrid...

1005
01:40:57.752 --> 01:41:00.653
...we drank the strong wine.

1006
01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:12.996
As we moved southeast...

1007
01:41:13.167 --> 01:41:17.570
...Alexander often returned the lands
we'd conquered to their defeated kings...

1008
01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:20.803
...S0 as to make of them allies.

1009
01:41:28.182 --> 01:41:31.152
But this did not sit well with the army.

1010
01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:20.562
Give him a kiss.

1011
01:42:20.735 --> 01:42:22.703
Go on, kiss him.

1012
01:42:26.774 --> 01:42:28.640
Give him a kiss.

1013
01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:41.079
-To Bagoas.
-To Bagoas!

1014
01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:49.122
-And to my mother's god, Dionysus...
-Dionysus!

1015
01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:53.563
...who, we're told by our Indian allies,
traveled here before Herakles...

1016
01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:56.465
...some 6000 years ago.

1017
01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:58.162
To a hero.

1018
01:42:58.339 --> 01:43:00.330
To a hero!

1019
01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:20.924
Roxane.

1020
01:43:27.702 --> 01:43:30.137
You lose face.

1021
01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:31.863
These Indians...

1022
01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.803
...they are a low, evil people.

1023
01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:36.443
You don't try to understand them.

1024
01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.874
I try.

1025
01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:42.072
But this I know, Alexander.

1026
01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:45.344
In Persia, you are a great king.

1027
01:43:45.519 --> 01:43:47.078
Here...

1028
01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:49.222
...they hate you.

1029
01:43:51.826 --> 01:43:55.319
Let us go back to Babylon.

1030
01:43:56.297 --> 01:43:58.026
There, you are strong.

1031
01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:02.534
We'll talk about this later.

1032
01:44:02.703 --> 01:44:04.102
Yes.

1033
01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:05.796
Later.

1034
01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:07.498
Talk.

1035
01:44:10.311 --> 01:44:12.279
I shall come.

1036
01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.811
Tonight.

1037
01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:16.581
And I shall wait.

1038
01:44:18.419 --> 01:44:20.513
Good night, my king.

1039
01:44:22.223 --> 01:44:24.385
Your Majesty.

1040
01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:27.157
I'll toast to Bagoas.

1041
01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:32.732
And the 30,000 beautiful Persian boys...

1042
01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:35.870
...we're training to fight
in this great army.

1043
01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:41.240
And to the memory of Philip.

1044
01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:44.476
Had he lived to see his Macedonians...

1045
01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:47.671
...transformed into such...

1046
01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.577
...a pretty army.

1047
01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:53.049
To Philip.

1048
01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:55.416
To a real hero.

1049
01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:57.751
Philip!

1050
01:45:00.561 --> 01:45:05.465
And to Cleitus and his new appointment
as satrap of Bactria.

1051
01:45:05.633 --> 01:45:07.158
Cleitus.

1052
01:45:08.569 --> 01:45:11.197
That's a fancy way of putting it, Ptolemy.

1053
01:45:11.372 --> 01:45:14.364
But we all know what a pension
and an exile is...

1054
01:45:14.542 --> 01:45:16.374
...after 30 years' service.

1055
01:45:16.544 --> 01:45:20.606
You call governing
this major province exile?

1056
01:45:20.815 --> 01:45:23.944
Has Your Majesty given any
of his closest companions...

1057
01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:26.746
...a province so far from home?

1058
01:45:26.921 --> 01:45:30.357
Then you won't make a very
good satrap, will you, Cleitus?

1059
01:45:33.194 --> 01:45:35.322
So be it.

1060
01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:38.955
Let me rot in Macedonian rags...

1061
01:45:39.133 --> 01:45:41.295
...rather than shine...

1062
01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:42.799
...in Eastern pomp.

1063
01:45:44.238 --> 01:45:48.004
I won't quake and bow down
like the sycophants you have around you.

1064
01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:52.669
Hephaistion, Nearchus, Perdiccas.

1065
01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:57.515
As governor of one
of our most Asian of satrapies...

1066
01:45:57.685 --> 01:46:02.646
...Cleitus, does it not occur to you
that if my Persian subjects...

1067
01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:05.952
...bow down before me,
it's important for them to do so?

1068
01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:08.891
Do I insist on Greeks doing the same?

1069
01:46:09.063 --> 01:46:12.658
You accept Greek offerings
as a son of Zeus, do you not?

1070
01:46:16.003 --> 01:46:17.493
Only when offered.

1071
01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:20.106
Why don't you refuse
these vain flatteries?

1072
01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:23.236
What freedom is this, to bow before you?

1073
01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:26.004
You bow before Herakles,
and he was mortal...

1074
01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.807
...but a son of Zeus.

1075
01:46:27.982 --> 01:46:31.680
How can you, so young,
compare yourself to Herakles?

1076
01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.888
Why not?

1077
01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:39.416
I've achieved more in my years.

1078
01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:41.561
Traveled as far.

1079
01:46:41.729 --> 01:46:42.958
Probably farther.

1080
01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:45.326
Herakles did it by himself.

1081
01:46:45.499 --> 01:46:48.525
Did you conquer Asia
by yourself, Alexander?

1082
01:46:48.702 --> 01:46:50.500
Who planned the Asian invasion?

1083
01:46:50.671 --> 01:46:52.400
Was it not your father?

1084
01:46:52.573 --> 01:46:54.667
Or is his blood no longer good enough?

1085
01:46:55.009 --> 01:46:58.570
-Zeus-Amon, is it?
-You insult me, Cleitus.

1086
01:46:58.746 --> 01:47:01.511
You mock my family. Be careful.

1087
01:47:01.882 --> 01:47:05.477
Never would your father have taken
barbarians as his friends...

1088
01:47:05.653 --> 01:47:08.315
...asked us to fight with them
as equals in war.

1089
01:47:08.489 --> 01:47:10.389
Are we not good enough any longer?

1090
01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:12.651
I remember a time...

1091
01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:15.420
...when we could talk as men,
straight to the eye.

1092
01:47:15.596 --> 01:47:18.463
None of this scraping, groveling.

1093
01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:22.226
Now you kiss them?

1094
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:27.899
Take a barbarian, childless wife
and dare call her queen?

1095
01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:34.441
Go quickly, Cleitus,
before you ruin your life.

1096
01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:41.678
Doesn't your great pride
fear the gods any longer?

1097
01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:46.525
This army....
This army is your blood, boy!

1098
01:47:46.694 --> 01:47:48.753
Without it, you're nothing!

1099
01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:56.235
You no longer serve the purpose
of this march!

1100
01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:59.168
-Get him from my sight!
-I don't serve your purpose?!

1101
01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:03.402
What was I serving when I saved
your puppy life at Gaugamela?

1102
01:48:03.577 --> 01:48:06.979
Do you think we'd be forced now
to mate with brown apes?

1103
01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:08.546
Alexander!

1104
01:48:08.716 --> 01:48:11.048
Turn out the guards!
Arrest him for treason!

1105
01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:20.257
-Who's with him?
-No.

1106
01:48:20.427 --> 01:48:21.952
Who's with him?

1107
01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:24.758
I call Father Zeus to witness.

1108
01:48:24.932 --> 01:48:27.230
I call you to trial before him!

1109
01:48:27.401 --> 01:48:29.893
And we'll see how deep
this conspiracy cuts!

1110
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:32.300
-Take him!
-You speak of plots against you?

1111
01:48:32.473 --> 01:48:33.941
What about poor Parmenion?

1112
01:48:34.141 --> 01:48:36.940
You made me do your foul deed.
Have you no shame?

1113
01:48:37.945 --> 01:48:39.936
Hypocrite. Despot. False king.

1114
01:48:40.114 --> 01:48:43.084
You and your barbarian mother
live in shame.

1115
01:49:07.775 --> 01:49:09.504
Cleitus.

1116
01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:11.542
Oh, my Cleitus.

1117
01:49:48.148 --> 01:49:51.345
Philip, King of Macedonia...

1118
01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:53.384
...and leader of the Greeks.

1119
01:49:54.154 --> 01:49:59.115
All my life, I've waited to see Greeks
grovel with respect for Macedonia.

1120
01:50:00.394 --> 01:50:02.522
Today is that day.

1121
01:50:10.104 --> 01:50:12.835
They say already,
"Philip was a great general...

1122
01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:16.874
...but Alexander is simply great."

1123
01:50:18.245 --> 01:50:20.942
But if you ever insult me again...

1124
01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:23.083
...I'lIL kill you.

1125
01:50:28.889 --> 01:50:30.288
I've missed you.

1126
01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:33.119
In the spring, Persia.

1127
01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:35.455
You'll command my horse from the right.

1128
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:37.859
I'm honored, Father. I wouldn't miss it...

1129
01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:39.760
...for all the gold in the world.

1130
01:50:39.933 --> 01:50:42.561
Which, one day, you'll have.

1131
01:50:47.174 --> 01:50:49.734
A 13th god.

1132
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:53.005
My poor Philip.
He's lost his mind.

1133
01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:58.646
-Your Majesty.
-Attalus.

1134
01:51:03.157 --> 01:51:06.058
I hope the prince
is enjoying the spectacle...

1135
01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:09.093
...as much as our regent.

1136
01:51:09.263 --> 01:51:10.890
He's very tired.

1137
01:51:15.102 --> 01:51:17.400
Hey.

1138
01:51:19.806 --> 01:51:22.901
-Pausanias.
-Royal guard!

1139
01:51:23.177 --> 01:51:25.874
To the arena! March!

1140
01:51:26.046 --> 01:51:28.947
No guard, Your Majesty?
In all this crowd?

1141
01:51:29.116 --> 01:51:32.484
-Greeks all over the place.
-Cleitus, Cleitus.

1142
01:51:32.653 --> 01:51:34.712
My Cleitus.

1143
01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:37.817
This man you can
always trust, Alexander.

1144
01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:39.851
Treat him as you would me.

1145
01:51:40.027 --> 01:51:42.223
He'll guard your back for you.

1146
01:51:42.729 --> 01:51:44.925
Yes, Father.

1147
01:51:45.098 --> 01:51:47.499
My people are guard enough today.

1148
01:51:47.668 --> 01:51:51.263
Let these Greeks see for themselves
how I can walk through my people.

1149
01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:52.963
Then let them call me tyrant.

1150
01:51:53.507 --> 01:51:56.738
Bring the main guard in
after my entry only.

1151
01:51:56.910 --> 01:52:00.574
Cleitus, make sure the wine
flows steady all day.

1152
01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:02.806
I want them to like me.

1153
01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:12.551
Weren't you told? I go in alone.

1154
01:52:12.726 --> 01:52:14.820
Follow with the main guard.

1155
01:52:14.995 --> 01:52:16.429
Go on.

1156
01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:22.800
-Go on.
-Father, it's best I go with you.

1157
01:52:25.739 --> 01:52:28.834
You want the world to see
you're my successor.

1158
01:52:29.009 --> 01:52:31.000
Is that what she wants?

1159
01:52:31.478 --> 01:52:34.243
Don't look so hurt all the time,
Alexander. Be a man.

1160
01:52:34.414 --> 01:52:38.612
You count yourself lucky you were here
at all today, after your public display.

1161
01:52:42.389 --> 01:52:44.551
By Herakles, by Zeus, by all the gods...

1162
01:52:44.725 --> 01:52:47.285
...obey me this once!

1163
01:52:48.595 --> 01:52:51.155
Have courage, Father.

1164
01:52:51.331 --> 01:52:53.857
And go on your way
rejoicing that at each step...

1165
01:52:54.034 --> 01:52:56.230
...you may recall your valor.

1166
01:53:32.005 --> 01:53:35.942
And now, our beloved King Philip...

1167
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:39.238
...in whose honor
these wedding games begin.

1168
01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:57.029
Pausanias, I told you--

1169
01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:23.522
He murdered our king!

1170
01:55:38.432 --> 01:55:40.924
The king lives!

1171
01:55:41.101 --> 01:55:44.503
Alexander, son of Philip!

1172
01:55:44.671 --> 01:55:46.469
May the gods bless the king!

1173
01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:53.775
You're king now. You're king.

1174
01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:05.414
May the gods bless Alexander!

1175
01:56:07.394 --> 01:56:09.556
-Alexander!
-Alexander!

1176
01:56:28.682 --> 01:56:31.344
You break my heart, you men.

1177
01:56:31.518 --> 01:56:33.384
Afraid.

1178
01:56:34.788 --> 01:56:36.415
Of course you have fears.

1179
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:38.024
We all have fears...

1180
01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:41.354
...because no one has ever
gone this far before.

1181
01:56:41.928 --> 01:56:46.365
And now we are weeks from
the encircling ocean, our route home.

1182
01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.293
We'll build a fleet of ships...

1183
01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:51.438
...and sail all the way
back down the Nile to Egypt.

1184
01:56:51.605 --> 01:56:54.734
And from Alexandria,
we shall be home within weeks.

1185
01:56:55.108 --> 01:56:57.338
There to be reunited with our loved ones.

1186
01:56:57.511 --> 01:57:01.106
To share our great treasures
and tales of Asia.

1187
01:57:01.281 --> 01:57:06.117
And to enjoy our imperishable glory
to the ends of time.

1188
01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:10.813
-Follow Alexander.
-I'll follow you.

1189
01:57:15.462 --> 01:57:17.123
What?

1190
01:57:17.297 --> 01:57:20.699
-Silence?
-We're with you, Alexander!

1191
01:57:21.067 --> 01:57:22.592
Crateros.

1192
01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.000
Crateros.

1193
01:57:26.172 --> 01:57:27.298
And another one.

1194
01:57:39.319 --> 01:57:40.616
My king.

1195
01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:42.755
I'm a fighting man.

1196
01:57:42.923 --> 01:57:46.882
I don't like no bellyaching.
I won't tolerate it in any of my units.

1197
01:57:48.228 --> 01:57:50.424
I lost many a man.

1198
01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:54.159
Young ones, never been with a woman.

1199
01:57:55.402 --> 01:57:57.564
Some died of disease.

1200
01:57:58.138 --> 01:58:02.336
Some were butchered in Scythia
by the banks of the Oxus.

1201
01:58:02.509 --> 01:58:04.273
Some died good.

1202
01:58:04.444 --> 01:58:07.470
Some just didn't get no luck.

1203
01:58:08.315 --> 01:58:10.044
But they died.

1204
01:58:12.385 --> 01:58:15.286
Forty thousand I come over with
eight years ago.

1205
01:58:15.455 --> 01:58:19.517
And we march after you
more than 10,000 miles.

1206
01:58:20.594 --> 01:58:24.360
In the rain and the sun,
we fought for you.

1207
01:58:24.531 --> 01:58:27.626
Some of us, 50 battles we've been in.

1208
01:58:28.368 --> 01:58:30.769
We killed many a barbarian.

1209
01:58:32.439 --> 01:58:37.275
And now when I look around,
how many of them faces do I see?

1210
01:58:37.444 --> 01:58:41.210
Now you want us to fight more
of these crazy monkey tribes east of here.

1211
01:58:41.381 --> 01:58:44.942
We hear talk of thousands
of these elephant monsters...

1212
01:58:45.118 --> 01:58:48.053
...cross a hundred more rivers.

1213
01:58:48.922 --> 01:58:53.018
Crateros. Good Crateros.

1214
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:58.991
Who better than you to speak,
most noble of men.

1215
01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:03.934
But you know there's no part of me
without a scar or a bone broken.

1216
01:59:04.104 --> 01:59:09.907
By sword, knife, stone, catapult and club.
I've shared every hardship with all of you.

1217
01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:13.478
You have, my king,
and we love you for it.

1218
01:59:14.447 --> 01:59:18.042
But, by Zeus, too many have died.

1219
01:59:18.652 --> 01:59:22.179
You have no children, Alexander,
and we're just...

1220
01:59:22.355 --> 01:59:27.054
...humble men, we seek no disturbance
with the gods. All we wish for...

1221
01:59:27.227 --> 01:59:33.724
...is to see our children and our wives
and our grandchildren one last time...

1222
01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:38.000
...before we join our brothers
in that dark house they call Hades.

1223
01:59:41.941 --> 01:59:45.605
Yes. You're right, Crateros.

1224
01:59:45.779 --> 01:59:47.076
I have been negligent.

1225
01:59:49.249 --> 01:59:52.082
I should've sent you
veterans home sooner, and I will.

1226
01:59:52.252 --> 01:59:54.983
The first of you
shall be the Silver Shields.

1227
01:59:55.155 --> 02:00:00.218
Then every man who's served seven years.
With full pensions from our treasury.

1228
02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:05.191
And respected, rich, loved.

1229
02:00:05.365 --> 02:00:10.235
You'll be treated by your wives and children
as heroes for the rest of your lives...

1230
02:00:10.403 --> 02:00:14.601
...and enjoy a peaceful death.

1231
02:00:15.909 --> 02:00:18.037
But you dream, Crateros.

1232
02:00:18.778 --> 02:00:23.113
Your simplicity long ended when
you took Persian mistresses and children...

1233
02:00:23.283 --> 02:00:27.584
...and you thickened your holdings
with plunder and jewels.

1234
02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:33.657
Because you've fallen in love
with all the things in life that destroy men.

1235
02:00:34.661 --> 02:00:36.993
Do you not see?

1236
02:00:38.164 --> 02:00:41.429
And you, as well as I, know...

1237
02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:45.868
...that as the years decline
and the memories stale...

1238
02:00:46.039 --> 02:00:48.838
...and all your great victories fade...

1239
02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:54.674
...it will always be remembered,
you left your king in Asia!

1240
02:00:54.848 --> 02:00:57.510
For I will go on, with my Asians.

1241
02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:05.287
-To the jackals with you, then, Alexander.
-We come for you, and you discard us.

1242
02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:07.859
-Shame!
-We want to go home, Alexander.

1243
02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:09.756
We're tired of glory.

1244
02:01:09.929 --> 02:01:12.830
We want to see our wives
and children before we die.

1245
02:01:14.868 --> 02:01:16.927
I've got children I haven't even seen.

1246
02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:23.766
I want to see my children.

1247
02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:27.709
I paid for your bastard children.
I've taken nothing for myself.

1248
02:01:27.881 --> 02:01:31.112
And all I've asked of you
is one more month.

1249
02:01:33.987 --> 02:01:35.853
-Shame.
-That's your king.

1250
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:38.383
What would your father say?

1251
02:01:38.558 --> 02:01:41.721
I've taken you further
than my father ever dreamed.

1252
02:01:41.895 --> 02:01:45.854
So go home. I look to the
barbarians for their courage.

1253
02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:48.726
I go east.

1254
02:01:48.902 --> 02:01:50.927
He wants us dead
so we can't speak of his crimes.

1255
02:01:51.104 --> 02:01:53.300
-Who said that?
-We won't make it to Macedonia.

1256
02:01:53.473 --> 02:01:55.271
You despicable coward. Come forth.

1257
02:01:55.441 --> 02:01:58.342
-Make your accusations public.
-So you can have us killed?

1258
02:01:58.511 --> 02:02:01.503
-Son of Zeus.
-You desecrate your real father's memory.

1259
02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:07.814
-Or did you murder him like you did Cleitus?
-Hide in this mob because I'll take your life.

1260
02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:21.496
You men insult my honor, my paternity.
Arrest him.

1261
02:02:21.668 --> 02:02:25.571
And him. Yes.
And you, this loudmouth Demetrius.

1262
02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:29.368
You call me murderer?
I have no such blood on my hands.

1263
02:02:29.542 --> 02:02:32.671
And him.
Yes, you'll know the pain of treason.

1264
02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:37.839
You mock my shame for Cleitus and say
I'd harm a hair of my father's head.

1265
02:02:38.585 --> 02:02:42.351
Arrest him.
After all I've done for you, you swine.

1266
02:02:42.522 --> 02:02:44.422
You cowards. Traitors.

1267
02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:49.361
Come on, then.
Where are your daggers?

1268
02:02:51.598 --> 02:02:55.933
In smashing the mutiny
and executing the ringleaders...

1269
02:02:56.102 --> 02:03:01.233
...he did nothing, to my mind, that any
general in wartime would not have done.

1270
02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:04.876
But clearly, the army was divided.

1271
02:03:05.812 --> 02:03:09.908
And Alexander was no longer
loved by all.

1272
02:03:12.719 --> 02:03:17.247
He drove on, south to the outer ocean.

1273
02:03:18.892 --> 02:03:21.520
I confess a disappointment.

1274
02:03:21.694 --> 02:03:25.892
Especially on these reports of your
taking on Eastern ways.

1275
02:03:26.065 --> 02:03:31.595
Beware how these manners inflame
the senses with pride.

1276
02:03:32.171 --> 02:03:36.199
However, I have lived long enough now...

1277
02:03:36.376 --> 02:03:38.003
...to question...

1278
02:03:38.177 --> 02:03:43.980
...when so many others invest
such emotion in their disrespect for you.

1279
02:03:44.717 --> 02:03:51.089
I can only hope that you continue
what you began as the boy I knew at 72.

1280
02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:56.127
Be that man always, Alexander,
and you will not slip.

1281
02:03:56.296 --> 02:04:01.325
And perhaps you will prove
this old materialist...

1282
02:04:01.501 --> 02:04:04.232
...as you always thought me:

1283
02:04:04.404 --> 02:04:07.396
A dreamer after all.

1284
02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:10.942
Aristotle.

1285
02:04:26.359 --> 02:04:28.293
Stay calm.

1286
02:04:28.628 --> 02:04:30.460
Together we are strong as gods.

1287
02:04:32.098 --> 02:04:36.695
Cover with your left,
strike hard with your right.

1288
02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:42.975
Fear is rot. A waste of time.

1289
02:04:49.015 --> 02:04:51.211
Lock shields.

1290
02:04:53.786 --> 02:04:55.948
Battle positions.

1291
02:04:57.857 --> 02:04:59.450
Move.

1292
02:05:05.631 --> 02:05:08.862
Choppers, prepare your knives.

1293
02:05:09.035 --> 02:05:10.799
Follow me.

1294
02:05:27.153 --> 02:05:30.589
Strike hard, boys. Strike hard.

1295
02:05:48.708 --> 02:05:53.270
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you hang back? Hurry.

1296
02:05:53.446 --> 02:05:55.676
Cavalry!

1297
02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:07.523
Split to thirds. Regroup and encircle.

1298
02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:59.842
-Oh, no. Cavalry on me.
-Follow Alexander.

1299
02:07:03.282 --> 02:07:07.014
Charge. Charge. Charge.

1300
02:07:10.256 --> 02:07:12.088
The phalanx is in jeopardy.

1301
02:07:12.258 --> 02:07:15.592
Meleager, ride to Pharnakes
and tell him return to the center.

1302
02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:19.595
Find Hephaistion at the riverbank
and bring all cavalry to the center.

1303
02:07:19.765 --> 02:07:22.928
We must reach Crateros
before it's too late.

1304
02:07:43.656 --> 02:07:46.853
Hephaistion. To the center.

1305
02:07:49.662 --> 02:07:51.994
Come, Macedonians. Ride.

1306
02:07:52.165 --> 02:07:54.600
Ride.

1307
02:08:37.476 --> 02:08:40.104
Coenus! Get out of there.

1308
02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.770
No.

1309
02:09:12.445 --> 02:09:15.312
-The horses won't go.
-On foot, then.

1310
02:09:21.821 --> 02:09:25.883
Fall back, men! Fall back!

1311
02:09:27.226 --> 02:09:28.819
Come, Bucephalus.

1312
02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:39.700
'Tis only sun and shadow.

1313
02:09:42.475 --> 02:09:45.274
You and I together,
one last time, Bucephalus.

1314
02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:50.845
Isn't it a lovely thing
to live with great courage...

1315
02:09:51.017 --> 02:09:53.782
...and to die leaving an everlasting fame?

1316
02:09:54.353 --> 02:09:57.789
Come, Macedonians.
Why do you retreat?

1317
02:09:57.957 --> 02:10:03.794
Do you want to live forever?
In the name of Zeus, attack.

1318
02:10:19.812 --> 02:10:22.076
Attack.

1319
02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:25.575
Alexander!

1320
02:10:36.462 --> 02:10:38.453
Alexander.

1321
02:12:11.223 --> 02:12:12.918
-The king is down!
-To the king!

1322
02:13:35.274 --> 02:13:38.869
It was the bloodiest of his battles.

1323
02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:44.647
Pure butchery.

1324
02:13:50.122 --> 02:13:52.147
We'd never be men again.

1325
02:15:03.562 --> 02:15:04.927
Get out.

1326
02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:07.866
Go.

1327
02:15:12.805 --> 02:15:15.206
How can you behave
so shamelessly in public?

1328
02:15:15.374 --> 02:15:17.638
Because it was meant to be.

1329
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:19.869
This isn't how I wanted to become king.

1330
02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:24.380
-No one blames you.
-They blame me behind my back! In secret.

1331
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:26.109
-Slander is not power.
-Shame is?

1332
02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:30.878
Who killed my father?

1333
02:15:31.390 --> 02:15:32.983
Tell me.

1334
02:15:33.158 --> 02:15:35.855
Tell me, or shall I put you on trial
for his murder?

1335
02:15:36.028 --> 02:15:38.622
-Pausanias.
-He had help!

1336
02:15:38.797 --> 02:15:40.925
Did you help him?

1337
02:15:48.007 --> 02:15:50.305
No, never.

1338
02:15:50.776 --> 02:15:53.711
Why? Why would I?

1339
02:15:54.847 --> 02:15:56.508
So many wanted it.

1340
02:15:56.682 --> 02:15:58.047
Greeks, Persians, men--

1341
02:15:58.217 --> 02:16:00.185
You're mad. You're cursed.

1342
02:16:00.352 --> 02:16:03.014
You've unleashed Furies,
you don't know their power.

1343
02:16:03.188 --> 02:16:06.089
Now who is exaggerating?

1344
02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:09.290
Even if it was the wish of your heart--

1345
02:16:09.461 --> 02:16:12.158
That's a lie! He was my father!
I loved him!

1346
02:16:12.331 --> 02:16:14.197
He was not your father!

1347
02:16:14.366 --> 02:16:16.494
You owe no blood debt to that man.

1348
02:16:16.669 --> 02:16:19.468
You lie and lie and lie.

1349
02:16:19.638 --> 02:16:22.699
So many lies you've spun
like a sorceress, confusing me.

1350
02:16:22.875 --> 02:16:26.277
Look at you. Look at you.

1351
02:16:26.445 --> 02:16:29.938
You are everything that he was not.

1352
02:16:30.115 --> 02:16:33.415
He was coarse, you are refined.

1353
02:16:33.585 --> 02:16:37.488
He was a general, and you are a king.

1354
02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:39.681
He could not rule himself...

1355
02:16:39.958 --> 02:16:43.087
...and you shall rule the world.

1356
02:16:43.262 --> 02:16:46.960
You're so cursed by all the gods
when you speak like this.

1357
02:16:47.132 --> 02:16:49.032
Such thick pride...

1358
02:16:49.201 --> 02:16:51.101
...and no mourning for your husband.

1359
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:52.669
Mourn...

1360
02:16:52.838 --> 02:16:54.397
...him?

1361
02:16:55.374 --> 02:16:57.900
What do you know of Philip?

1362
02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:03.712
No, Alexander. Zeus is your father.

1363
02:17:04.450 --> 02:17:08.182
-Act like it.
-My first act would be to kill you!

1364
02:17:09.455 --> 02:17:11.787
You murdered me in my cradle.

1365
02:17:11.957 --> 02:17:14.187
You birthed me in a sack of hate.

1366
02:17:14.359 --> 02:17:16.521
Hate you have for those
stronger than you.

1367
02:17:16.695 --> 02:17:20.563
-Hate you have for men.
-l taught you my heart, Alexander!

1368
02:17:20.733 --> 02:17:24.567
And by Zeus and Dionysus,
you grew beautiful.

1369
02:17:24.737 --> 02:17:27.035
Damn your sorceress soul.

1370
02:17:27.206 --> 02:17:29.903
Your soul is mine, Alexander.

1371
02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:32.901
No! No!

1372
02:17:33.579 --> 02:17:37.482
You've taken from me everything
I've ever loved and made me you!

1373
02:17:38.117 --> 02:17:40.142
Stop it. Stop acting like a boy.

1374
02:17:40.319 --> 02:17:42.788
You're a king. Act like one.

1375
02:17:42.955 --> 02:17:44.719
Parmenion is with us, for once.

1376
02:17:44.890 --> 02:17:46.756
Execute Attalus without delay.

1377
02:17:46.925 --> 02:17:49.860
Confiscate their lands and root out
that family forever.

1378
02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:51.462
Eurydice? Never.

1379
02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:53.064
Laugh, you monster.

1380
02:17:53.232 --> 02:17:54.597
You heartbreaker.

1381
02:17:54.767 --> 02:17:57.668
How will you live out the year like this?

1382
02:17:57.836 --> 02:18:02.569
-Have you learned nothing from Philip?
-No. From you, Mother.

1383
02:18:05.677 --> 02:18:07.372
The best.

1384
02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:21.986
What have I done
to make you hate me so?

1385
02:18:23.762 --> 02:18:28.393
One day, you will understand this.

1386
02:18:28.567 --> 02:18:32.128
But I have only you in my heart.

1387
02:18:34.773 --> 02:18:38.004
I know what you need.

1388
02:18:38.944 --> 02:18:41.242
Now is the time.

1389
02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:43.677
The gods favor you.

1390
02:18:44.016 --> 02:18:47.316
Great wealth, power, conquest.

1391
02:18:47.486 --> 02:18:49.250
All you desire.

1392
02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:52.049
The world is yours!

1393
02:18:52.224 --> 02:18:54.158
Take it.

1394
02:18:58.697 --> 02:19:00.461
Take it.

1395
02:19:22.621 --> 02:19:26.057
He never saw his mother again.

1396
02:19:28.861 --> 02:19:32.058
And while he was away,
fighting the Northern tribes...

1397
02:19:32.231 --> 02:19:37.897
...Olympias had Philip's new wife,
Eurydice, and her infant son murdered.

1398
02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:41.030
By necessity...

1399
02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:44.972
...he had her uncle Attalus executed.

1400
02:20:25.384 --> 02:20:29.014
He lives! Alexander!

1401
02:20:51.076 --> 02:20:53.340
Men of Macedon...

1402
02:20:54.046 --> 02:20:56.174
...we're going home.

1403
02:20:57.282 --> 02:20:59.683
-What?
-What?

1404
02:20:59.851 --> 02:21:01.546
-We're going home.
-Home?

1405
02:21:01.753 --> 02:21:03.881
We're going.

1406
02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:10.484
We're going home.

1407
02:22:17.596 --> 02:22:20.657
His life should have ended in India...

1408
02:22:21.299 --> 02:22:22.767
...but that's myth.

1409
02:22:24.302 --> 02:22:29.263
In life, Herakles died of a poisoned shirt,
given him in error by his jealous wife.

1410
02:22:29.841 --> 02:22:31.206
Great Zeus...

1411
02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:34.607
...we have worshipped you in blood.

1412
02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:37.340
Look kindly on our homeward steps...

1413
02:22:37.516 --> 02:22:41.953
...and smile upon our backs.

1414
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:50.292
May all those who come here after us
know, when they see this altar...

1415
02:22:50.462 --> 02:22:54.160
...that Titans were once here.

1416
02:23:09.481 --> 02:23:13.349
Making his devotions to the gods
at the end of the great journey...

1417
02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:18.820
...Alexander bade the East farewell
and marched his army directly west...

1418
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:21.152
...across the great Gedrosian desert...

1419
02:23:21.359 --> 02:23:24.795
...seeking the shortest route home
to Babylon.

1420
02:23:26.231 --> 02:23:30.600
Here, he watched helplessly
the cruel breaking of his army.

1421
02:23:30.769 --> 02:23:33.500
Not by any human foe...

1422
02:23:33.672 --> 02:23:36.004
...but by nature.

1423
02:23:37.576 --> 02:23:42.070
To this day, there is no accounting
of how many died.

1424
02:23:57.896 --> 02:24:00.866
-Just last night he was--
-It's the water, Your Majesty.

1425
02:24:01.032 --> 02:24:03.262
He mixed it with the wine.

1426
02:24:04.336 --> 02:24:05.963
But how can this be?

1427
02:24:06.138 --> 02:24:10.166
-Typhus of India?
-I wouldn't tax yourself, Your Majesty.

1428
02:24:10.342 --> 02:24:15.212
A few good nights' rest will do it.
But no wine or cold--

1429
02:24:16.348 --> 02:24:17.782
Come, doctor.

1430
02:24:26.358 --> 02:24:28.690
I feel better.

1431
02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:33.195
Soon, I'll be up.

1432
02:24:34.099 --> 02:24:38.036
We leave for Arabia in the spring,
and I couldn't leave without you.

1433
02:24:38.637 --> 02:24:41.038
Arabia.

1434
02:24:43.808 --> 02:24:49.110
You used to dress me up like a sheik...

1435
02:24:49.814 --> 02:24:51.714
...wave your wooden scimitar.

1436
02:24:51.883 --> 02:24:54.978
You were the only one
who'd never let me win.

1437
02:24:56.788 --> 02:24:59.814
The only one who's ever been
honest with me.

1438
02:25:00.292 --> 02:25:03.227
You saved me from myself.

1439
02:25:05.664 --> 02:25:08.827
Please don't leave me, Hephaistion.

1440
02:25:17.676 --> 02:25:22.113
I remember the young man who wanted
to be Achilles...

1441
02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:25.215
...and then outdid him.

1442
02:25:25.383 --> 02:25:27.317
And then what happened?

1443
02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:30.853
Ours is a myth only young men believe.

1444
02:25:31.456 --> 02:25:37.623
-But how beautiful a myth it was.
-We reach, we fall.

1445
02:25:38.863 --> 02:25:41.833
Oh, Hephaistion.

1446
02:25:47.472 --> 02:25:53.070
-I worry for you without me.
-I am nothing without you.

1447
02:25:54.012 --> 02:25:57.710
Come, fight, Hephaistion.

1448
02:25:58.016 --> 02:26:00.508
We will die together.

1449
02:26:03.588 --> 02:26:09.186
We'll have children with our wives, and
our sons will play together as we once did.

1450
02:26:10.128 --> 02:26:13.758
A thousand ships
we'll launch from here, Hephaistion.

1451
02:26:14.466 --> 02:26:19.199
We'll round Arabia
and sail up the gulf to Egypt.

1452
02:26:20.038 --> 02:26:24.532
From there, we'll build a channel through
the desert and out to the Middle Sea.

1453
02:26:24.709 --> 02:26:29.647
And then we'll move on Carthage. And that
great island, Sicily, they'll pay large tribute.

1454
02:26:30.615 --> 02:26:34.552
After that, the Roman tribe,
good fighters. We'll beat them.

1455
02:26:35.587 --> 02:26:38.113
And then explore the northern forests...

1456
02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:42.056
...and out the Pillars of Herakles
to the western ocean.

1457
02:26:43.295 --> 02:26:47.528
And then one day,
not 10 years from now...

1458
02:26:47.732 --> 02:26:52.863
...Alexandrias will grow,
populations will mix and travel freely.

1459
02:26:53.038 --> 02:26:55.735
Asia and Europe will come together.

1460
02:26:57.542 --> 02:27:01.445
And we'll grow old, Hephaistion...

1461
02:27:02.147 --> 02:27:07.779
...looking out our balcony
at this new world.

1462
02:27:14.259 --> 02:27:16.660
Hephaistion?

1463
02:27:18.063 --> 02:27:20.430
Hephaistion?

1464
02:27:23.668 --> 02:27:28.299
-Where is this doctor?
-l can't explain this, Your Majesty.

1465
02:27:28.473 --> 02:27:32.876
-It's not possible. I swear by Apollo.
-Execute him!

1466
02:27:33.712 --> 02:27:37.205
Take him out now and execute him.

1467
02:27:37.382 --> 02:27:41.580
-Come away, come away.
-Liars. Liars. You all hated him. All of you.

1468
02:27:42.287 --> 02:27:45.917
Get out. Get out now!

1469
02:27:53.898 --> 02:27:56.390
Be gone.

1470
02:27:56.568 --> 02:28:01.506
Be gone with you.
Harpies. Get out. Get out.

1471
02:28:01.673 --> 02:28:03.505
Are you drunk again?

1472
02:28:03.675 --> 02:28:05.234
-Get out.
-He's dead.

1473
02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:08.175
-Who?
-Many hated him...

1474
02:28:08.346 --> 02:28:11.281
...but I don't think any other
would have dared.

1475
02:28:12.784 --> 02:28:14.843
Hephaistion is dead?

1476
02:28:18.790 --> 02:28:20.758
Are you mad?

1477
02:28:22.894 --> 02:28:24.419
You monster.

1478
02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:28.565
-Are you mad?
-You've taken from me all I've ever loved.

1479
02:28:28.733 --> 02:28:32.931
May all the Furies through time
damn your miserable heart. Obey me.

1480
02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:38.670
Alexander.
I have your child. Alexander.

1481
02:28:40.178 --> 02:28:42.977
-Alexander, we have a son.
-No.

1482
02:28:44.616 --> 02:28:47.142
-The child.
-Oh, Your Majesty, no.

1483
02:28:47.318 --> 02:28:53.724
Alexander, I have your child.
Alexander, my husband, my king.

1484
02:28:53.892 --> 02:28:56.327
We have a son.

1485
02:28:56.828 --> 02:29:00.196
My poor, poor, ill-fated son.

1486
02:29:01.866 --> 02:29:03.527
Never touch me again.

1487
02:29:06.938 --> 02:29:08.963
No!

1488
02:29:14.579 --> 02:29:17.378
One last toast!

1489
02:29:20.685 --> 02:29:22.585
Before the dawn.

1490
02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:32.790
To my old friends.

1491
02:29:49.714 --> 02:29:53.582
-And to the myths.
-To the myths.

1492
02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:04.192
Drink it down, Alexander.

1493
02:30:04.362 --> 02:30:06.456
Drink it down.

1494
02:30:20.879 --> 02:30:24.247
Yes, come on. Finish it.

1495
02:30:45.203 --> 02:30:47.331
To the next dawn.

1496
02:31:08.726 --> 02:31:11.752
-Bless you, Alexander.
-Lord, we love you.

1497
02:31:12.997 --> 02:31:15.295
Bless you, Alexander.

1498
02:31:19.203 --> 02:31:21.262
We love you, Alexander.

1499
02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:26.039
Pay your respects, gentlemen,
but pay them quickly.

1500
02:31:27.645 --> 02:31:30.137
We love you, Alexander...

1501
02:31:31.316 --> 02:31:33.580
...and your seed.

1502
02:31:35.787 --> 02:31:38.085
Keep moving, men, please.

1503
02:31:43.428 --> 02:31:45.760
Yes, come.

1504
02:31:45.930 --> 02:31:52.427
Come to Babylon. I await you.
Your only loving son.

1505
02:32:05.717 --> 02:32:08.914
Wait. Wait.

1506
02:32:09.754 --> 02:32:11.984
Vultures. Wait.

1507
02:32:12.156 --> 02:32:14.818
Your son, Alexander.

1508
02:32:14.993 --> 02:32:17.587
Just three more months.

1509
02:32:17.762 --> 02:32:19.992
Please live.

1510
02:32:20.164 --> 02:32:24.795
Alexander, we beg you. Tell us who.

1511
02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:27.904
Who will rule this great empire
if you leave us?

1512
02:32:28.139 --> 02:32:31.234
-Fear not. We're at the beginning.
-You're a great man.

1513
02:32:38.316 --> 02:32:42.275
What would you do
if you had reached the end of the world?

1514
02:32:47.191 --> 02:32:50.855
When it's over, all that matters is
what you've done. I'll remember.

1515
02:32:51.029 --> 02:32:53.964
Zeus is your father.

1516
02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:57.230
Alexander, the army will divide.

1517
02:32:57.402 --> 02:33:00.269
Satrapies will revolt.
Without orders, there'll be war.

1518
02:33:00.438 --> 02:33:01.735
Who will it be?

1519
02:33:02.907 --> 02:33:05.433
Pray tell us, who?

1520
02:33:07.812 --> 02:33:10.474
-What did he say?
-"To the best."

1521
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:14.917
-He said, "To the best."
-What?

1522
02:33:15.086 --> 02:33:17.418
-No, he said, "To Crateros."
-To Crateros?

1523
02:33:17.588 --> 02:33:19.249
Why would he say Crateros?

1524
02:34:20.852 --> 02:34:25.085
On the 10th of June,
a month short of his 33rd year...

1525
02:34:25.256 --> 02:34:29.693
...Alexander's great heart
gave out.

1526
02:34:31.229 --> 02:34:35.427
And as he vowed,
he joined Hephaistion.

1527
02:34:55.853 --> 02:34:58.117
-The body stays in Babylon.
-Within hours...

1528
02:34:58.289 --> 02:35:01.281
...we were fighting like jackals
for his corpse.

1529
02:35:01.459 --> 02:35:03.587
The wars of the world had begun.

1530
02:35:04.162 --> 02:35:06.221
Forty years, off and on, they endured.

1531
02:35:07.198 --> 02:35:11.635
Until we divided his empire in four parts.

1532
02:35:11.803 --> 02:35:15.865
Cassander in Greece.
Crateros and Antigonus in western Asia.

1533
02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:19.635
Solucas and Perdiccas in the East.
Myself in Egypt.

1534
02:35:19.811 --> 02:35:21.472
Gentlemen, we are not savages.

1535
02:35:21.646 --> 02:35:24.274
Cassander certainly proved
his will to power...

1536
02:35:24.448 --> 02:35:29.010
...when seven years later,
he had Olympias executed.

1537
02:35:30.755 --> 02:35:33.417
And within 12 years, he achieved...

1538
02:35:33.591 --> 02:35:36.526
...the complete destruction
of Alexander's bloodline...

1539
02:35:38.095 --> 02:35:39.995
...when he poisoned Roxane...

1540
02:35:40.164 --> 02:35:45.933
...and Alexander's 13-year-old son,
the true heir to the empire.

1541
02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:53.004
But the truth is never simple...

1542
02:35:53.878 --> 02:35:55.937
...and yet it is.

1543
02:35:56.414 --> 02:35:59.440
The truth is, we did kill him.

1544
02:36:03.054 --> 02:36:06.456
By silence, we consented.

1545
02:36:06.891 --> 02:36:08.859
Because--

1546
02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:11.552
Because we couldn't go on.

1547
02:36:11.729 --> 02:36:17.065
What, by Ares, did we look forward to
but to be discarded in the end, like Cleitus?

1548
02:36:17.235 --> 02:36:22.469
After all this time, to give away our wealth
to Asian sycophants we despised?

1549
02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:25.837
Mixing the races, harmony?

1550
02:36:26.844 --> 02:36:29.609
Oh, he talked of these things...

1551
02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:35.549
...but wasn't it really about Alexander
and another population ready to obey him?

1552
02:36:36.587 --> 02:36:39.522
I never believed in his dream.

1553
02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:41.818
None of us did.

1554
02:36:43.561 --> 02:36:45.825
That's the truth of his life.

1555
02:36:45.997 --> 02:36:48.591
The dreamers exhaust us.

1556
02:36:49.333 --> 02:36:53.497
They must die before they kill us
with their blasted dreams.

1557
02:36:54.872 --> 02:36:57.739
Oh, just throw all that away, Cadmos.

1558
02:36:57.909 --> 02:37:00.344
It's an old fool's rubbish.

1559
02:37:02.179 --> 02:37:07.583
You shall write, "He died of fever
and a weakened condition."

1560
02:37:08.386 --> 02:37:10.218
Yes, great Pharaoh.

1561
02:37:13.491 --> 02:37:19.396
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

1562
02:37:19.563 --> 02:37:25.730
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

1563
02:37:27.138 --> 02:37:31.097
The freest man I've ever known.

1564
02:37:32.777 --> 02:37:37.772
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

1565
02:37:37.949 --> 02:37:41.681
...and impatience with those
who could not understand.

1566
02:37:42.019 --> 02:37:44.716
And if his desire...

1567
02:37:44.889 --> 02:37:49.793
...to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure....

1568
02:37:52.330 --> 02:37:55.459
What failure!

1569
02:37:55.733 --> 02:38:01.900
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

1570
02:38:06.544 --> 02:38:08.308
I've lived--

1571
02:38:08.512 --> 02:38:10.879
I've lived long life, Cadmos...

1572
02:38:11.048 --> 02:38:13.415
...but the glory
and the memory of man...

1573
02:38:13.584 --> 02:38:18.522
...will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

1574
02:38:18.990 --> 02:38:24.224
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

1575
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:29.332
...Megas Alexandros.

1576
02:38:30.768 --> 02:38:33.965
The greatest Alexander of them all.

1577
