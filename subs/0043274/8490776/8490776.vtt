- The jam. By order of the king.

1022
01:10:31.203 --> 01:10:34.498
- The jam.
- Let me have it.

1023
01:10:38.085 --> 01:10:43.507
Somebody's head
is going to roll for this!

1024
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:45.509
Ah-ha!

1025
01:10:45.592 --> 01:10:47.719
The mushroom.

1026
01:10:47.803 --> 01:10:50.597
Off with her...

01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:52.766
[cards shout]

1028
01:10:55.143 --> 01:10:58.647
Oh, pooh. I'm not afraid of you.

1029
01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:01.650
Why, you're nothing but a pack of cards.

1030
01:11:01.733 --> 01:11:08.073
Rule 42: all persons more than a mile
high must leave the court immediately.

1031
01:11:08.156 --> 01:11:11.243
I'm not a mile high,
and I'm not leaving.

1032
01:11:11.326 --> 01:11:14.705
[chuckles nervously]
Sorry. Rule 42, you know.

1033
01:11:14.788 --> 01:11:19.042
And as for you... Your Majesty.

1034
01:11:19.126 --> 01:11:23.213
Your Majesty indeed.
You're not a queen.

1035
01:11:23.297 --> 01:11:29.386
You're just a fat, pompous,
bad-tempered old ty... tyrant.

[chuckles]

1037
01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:36.643
And er... what were you saying, my dear?

1038
01:11:36.727 --> 01:11:41.148
Well, she simply said that you're a fat,
pompous, bad-tempered old tyrant.

1039
01:11:41.231 --> 01:11:43.692
Off with her head!

1040
01:11:49.614 --> 01:11:53.368
