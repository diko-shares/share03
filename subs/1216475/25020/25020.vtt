1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,660
What the hell are you doing here?

2
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:03,579
I didn't realise you were
actually going to move out.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,905
That's what a separation is, Cal.
You and Lydia are my world.

4
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:08,320
Mum, I'm going to be late.

5
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:10,357
Hello, Josephine.
Lewis.

6
00:00:10,423 --> 00:00:11,971
Helena Chatterjee, my associate.

7
00:00:12,037 --> 00:00:14,405
Lewis Hughes, my
Greatest admirer.

8
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,316
Chambers have become
available on my floor.

9
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,837
You'd be doing what you love.

10
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,840
I am doing what I love.
I'm helping people who need me.

11
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:23,359
We could start over.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,440
I've got no income,

13
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,919
and the fire insurance
payout will take forever.

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,000
I can't pay you.

15
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,159
You don't have to go after
high-end work all the time.

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,399
You could still help the odd desperado.

17
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,639
Welcome to Knox, Ms Newton.
Thank you.

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,199
Come meet the Grand Poobah.

19
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,479
You said she hasn't
run a case in 15 years.

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,334
This will be the shortest return to
the bar in the history of the bar.

21
00:00:42,638 --> 00:00:44,847
They are shut like a clam.
No more washing.

22
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:45,799
It's a dump.

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,839
But just imagine.
Chatterjee & Chatterjee Solicitors.

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,039
Is this legal
to have a solicitor's office

25
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,999
in the basement of barristers' chambers?

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,160
Well, you know, it's not illegal,
and if anyone gives us any trouble

27
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll deal with them.
No, we'll take them to court.

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,039
Cheers. That should do the trick.

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,108
Oi, you ready?
Yeah, all good, Cal.

30
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:14,599
All right, folks, let's go.
Let's save some fairy possums.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,959
Whoo!
Pants on.

32
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:19,320
Lyds, coffee.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,559
Instant coffee will kill you.

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,959
No, no, it's single-origin,

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,112
from the foothills of, um
Daisy over there.

36
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,239
Do you really think all this
is going to do anything?

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,959
I have a quaint
and old-fashioned notion

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,119
that many people in one
place can make a difference.

39
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,879
Just do it all online. It's warmer.

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,919
Yeah, there's a word for that,
you know 'slacktivism'.

41
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,479
Well, here I am suffering for the cause.

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,039
Yeah, only because you had a maths exam.

43
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,959
Couldn't care less about the possums

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,879
getting their habitat taken
over by a luxury resort,

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
even though my own habitat's
looking pretty shaky right now.

46
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:53,320
Okay, I take it back.

47
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:55,639
Was it a geography test?

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,639
Do you want me to take
these photos or not?

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,040
Yes. Please!

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,119
All right, look,
one of the minibus drivers said

51
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,879
there's phone coverage
at the top of that hill.

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,599
Thank God.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,920
Back for the group hug.

54
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,319
Oh!

55
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,879
Okay.
Hey, sorry.

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,040
Gross.

57
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:26,959
Didn't think anyone else was around.

58
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,956
Yeah, well, you should
have thought of that.

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,279
You, um, looking for phone coverage?
Trying to.

60
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,039
You're not one of those
crazy protesters, are you?

61
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,400
No.

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,519
Somewhere between the minister and
his little mate Laurie Trencherman.

63
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,519
Lost, magically,
in the Kafka-esque corridors of

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,239
Strategic Development Incorporated.

65
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:54,919
Oh, and make him welcome, folks.
Right on time.

66
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,119
Cue the Darth Vader music.

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,039
That's right, Laurie.
We know who you are.

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,679
We know this isn't the first time

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,101
you've trampled over
environmental concerns

70
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,280
to build one of your monstrosities.

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,563
So, Lydia

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,119
You did it in Westbrook,
you did it in Shelton

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,200
and you did it in Noongar.

74
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,079
So, Mitch, do you drive this?

75
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:27,159
Yeah, sometimes.
Can I have a look?

76
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,323
Unfettered developments.

77
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:33,130
Well, you are a dinosaur and
a meteor is on its way, pal.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,159
You look good.
Yeah?

79
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,559
How many luxury apartments
are you going to cram

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,798
onto this one little square of bushland?
How many?

81
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,759
We should probably

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,199
Oh, oh, oh!

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,479
And in the spirit of compromise,
you bring on the bulldozers.

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,680
Nice, mate.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Look out!

86
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,440
Just get more of them down here,
you idiot!

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,879
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, come here.

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,000
You okay?
Yeah.

89
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,839
Yeah? Sure?
Yeah, I think so.

90
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,040
Wow! Wow!

91
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:28,199
All right, righto. Here we are.

92
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,639
New premises, same old faces.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,253
Now

94
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,479
um, we can, um, head inside.

95
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,959
If you want a snack at all,
you let me know, okay?

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,559
We've got the snack shack here.

97
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,079
Like I said,
this is going to get better.

98
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,359
I know you do love your House & Garden,

99
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,080
so I've got you your copy there.

100
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,685
Now, if Helena can't help you,
I certainly can, so, um

101
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,119
Ooh, sorry, it's stuck.

102
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,239
Thought you'd closed up shop.
I beg your pardon?

103
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,919
Just the basic wash, if you don't mind.

104
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,357
Um, no, I'm not
Won't need it till half five.

105
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:16,003
I'm sorry, you don't understand!

106
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,500
What was that?
I think he wants his car washed.

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,456
What type of car?

108
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,639
Ms Russo.
Mr Whitley.

109
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,280
Lovely morning.
Mm.

110
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,640
Excuse me.

111
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,999
Oh, Eric! Eric.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,432
Thought you might maybe
come round tonight.

113
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,119
To your place?

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,959
Well, why not?

115
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,800
I am a single man at long bloody last.

116
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,479
We could get takeaway,
maybe even a movie.

117
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,639
Mm.
Hmm?

118
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,599
I really don't think that's a good idea,
Eric.

119
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,919
Would you please get
Hemmingsworth on the line for me?

120
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,399
Of course, Mr Whitley.
Oh, and and my

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,159
It came back from the
dry cleaner's last night.

122
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,759
It's on the back of your door.

123
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,759
Is there a?
The receipt's on your desk.

124
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Morning.

125
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:26,839
So, they'll argue that the
uncle overstepped the mark

126
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,479
by approving the hormone treatment.

127
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,599
He was legal guardian at the time,
wasn't he?

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Well, exactly.

129
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,280
Morning.
Morning.

130
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,320
I've always felt like a girl.

131
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,880
Like I was born in the wrong body.

132
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,092
Like there's been some mistake.

133
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:50,719
I kept thinking one day I'd wake
up and everything would be fixed,

134
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,400
that I would finally
be who I really am

135
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,719
but that never happened,
and I had to pretend.

136
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,799
I've pretended to act like
a boy for most of my life.

137
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

138
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,839
The history is great,

139
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,119
but we have to demonstrate
that you're fully cognisant

140
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,705
of the consequences of
the hormone treatment.

141
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,439
Tell your story in your own words, Sam,

142
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,599
just like you did,
and we'll look after everything else.

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Yeah.

144
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,479
Is my dad coming to court?

145
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,879
Yes, and your mother.
They're flying in today.

146
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,707
But I'll be there too.

147
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,959
My brother is very traditional.

148
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,919
He comes from a different world,

149
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,199
but if he knew how unhappy Sam was,
then maybe he could change his mind.

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,119
Don't worry, Sam.

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,599
The court's job is to
decide what's best for you,

152
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,139
not what's best for your parents.

153
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,279
The parents will argue they
only gave up guardianship

154
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,599
so Sam could get access
to school in Australia.

155
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,639
It's good to see you've settled in.
What is that smell?

156
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,199
Smoke damage. It's a miracle
I managed to salvage anything.

157
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,719
Well, as Sam's counsel,
all I'm interested in

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,759
is if whether the parents have the right

159
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,599
to stop the treatment
now it's under way.

160
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,919
They'll argue that Sam
doesn't need the treatment.

161
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,959
Well, then they'll lose.
That's the spirit.

162
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,599
That's why you're taking centre stage.

163
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,199
No, it's not.

164
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,999
Why am I representing the child

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,919
while you're taking the
back seat with Uncle Jiao?

166
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,879
What?
"What?"

167
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,839
What's the real reason you
want me in the limelight?

168
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,479
Perhaps I need your superior intellect.

169
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,319
Oh, no doubt!

170
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,719
But there is an ulterior motive.
Who's the judge?

171
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,119
Gloria Stokes.

172
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,719
A woman.
Mm.

173
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
What did you do?
You have such a low opinion of me.

174
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,719
No,
I think you have a brilliant legal mind,

175
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,599
but I also know it plays no
part in your personal life.

176
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,959
Oh, I knew there was a downside
of bringing you to Knox,

177
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,319
apart from your general
lack of organisation.

178
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,120
I'm highly organised.

179
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,473
Catering, fitness program,
career, mothering

180
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:47,439
it's all sorted.

181
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,919
Yeah, until you wash your hands.

182
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,479
Sorry to interrupt.

183
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,199
Um, I'm just checking your husband

184
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,759
They're separated.
We're separated.

185
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,486
Did you mention that he's some
kind of environmental activist?

186
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:03,599
Is that right?
Yeah.

187
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,959
Oh.

188
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,919
This is just big business

189
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,199
Do you have to watch that here?
It's the biggest television.

190
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,999
And I thought it might be of interest.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,879
Police have
arrested one of the protesters.

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,960
Cal, mate, I was just thinking of you.

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,245
Hey, look, I've got someone
here who wants to have a word.

194
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,120
Sorry, Deirdre, I won't be a moment.
Excuse me.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,039
I thought that you were
going to work upstairs

196
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,240
and leave downstairs to me.

197
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,039
I'm not here as a barrister.
I'm bringing you a client.

198
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,559
Sorry, I'm confused.

199
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,240
Helena's going to handle everything.
This doesn't need to go upstairs.

200
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,799
Why aren't you at school?
Dad.

201
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,279
No. No!

202
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,919
You didn't take Lydia with you?

203
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,679
Okay, I thought we weren't going
to raise our voices in front of

204
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:12,790
Can I have a word, in private?

205
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,760
Sure.

206
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,759
I had no idea.

207
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,519
You knew about the protest,
and she wanted to come to help.

208
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
So, she just took the day off?

209
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,759
Yeah.
Well, it was a spontaneous decision.

210
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,439
Well, what about school?

211
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,319
Josie, this is educational.

212
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,359
Lydia cares about the issue.
She was into it.

213
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,799
Oh, yeah, she's really into
watching her dad get arrested!

214
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,679
I'll stop you there.
I didn't get arrested.

215
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,399
What?
She did.

216
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:42,470
Lydia?
Yes!

217
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,542
I am very sorry.

218
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,240
No, I

219
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,159
You are between myself and
the chemicals for cleaning.

220
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,958
Oh.
Oh, sorry.

221
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,119
Thank you.
I hope your day is a good one.

222
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,359
Oh!

223
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,359
The charge is criminal damage.

224
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,119
What does that mean?
I'm not a criminal.

225
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,119
In order to make criminal damage stick,

226
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
they need to prove intent.

227
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:10,159
Were you invited into the cabin?
Sort of.

228
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,759
Sort of?

229
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,879
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean any of this.

230
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,879
Lyds, it's okay. It's going to be fine.

231
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,719
None of this is your fault.
Yes, it is.

232
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,959
I wanted to go and now I've
got Dad in trouble too.

233
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,919
The construction
company's coming after me

234
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
for the value of the car,
as the responsible adult.

235
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,736
How much?
Don't worry.

236
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,720
It's all good. It's my problem.

237
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,439
Okay, right, just one at a time.

238
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,599
Let's just deal with the
civil case separately.

239
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,359
What kind of car are we talking about?

240
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,159
Hmm.

241
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,719
Yeah, a Series 6 BMW?

242
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,679
Something like 180 grand brand-new.

243
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,039
I can find you a cheap one.
I wouldn't count on service records.

244
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,079
Oh, no, never mind.
You stick to the Charger.

245
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,319
Euro cars are for wankers.
Thanks, Johnny.

246
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
Why can't you defend me?

247
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,920
'Cause I'm your mum,

248
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:04,759
and mothers can't defend, not in court.

249
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,119
But you will have a barrister.

250
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,439
I thought you said Helena
could handle this on her own.

251
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,279
That's before I knew Lydia was involved.

252
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,279
Wow, Josie,
it's okay to throw me to the dogs

253
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,704
You're used to it.
You get arrested for a living.

254
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:16,039
Is that seriously what
you think of my career?

255
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,159
Guys, this isn't helping.

256
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:19,706
She's absolutely right.

257
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,119
Going to give Lewis a call,
ask him to come down.

258
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,320
No. Wait.

259
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,639
Does he know that you're
moonlighting down here?

260
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,639
It's just that Helena is the one
that should contact him first,

261
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,959
as the briefing solicitor.

262
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,199
That's the protocol.

263
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,439
Lewis Hughes?
You want me to ask for Lewis Hughes?

264
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,639
He knows you worked for
me at Newton's Legal.

265
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,879
His clerk will say yes.

266
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,719
Really, it's no big deal.
It's a very big deal!

267
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,479
It's the biggest deal.

268
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,879
All the groundwork, all the preparation.

269
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,199
I've never briefed
senior counsel before!

270
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,720
I don't want to let you down.

271
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,439
When have you ever let me down?
There's always a first time.

272
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,920
Not today. Not ever.

273
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,920
For Lydia.

274
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,480
For Lydia.

275
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,319
Helena, what will be a big deal

276
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,999
is if Lewis finds out that
Chatterjee is downstairs.

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,759
Why, is that a problem?
It's just it's not a

278
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,382
It's a bad look.

279
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,800
Whose car is that?

280
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,719
Some old dude from upstairs.
Should I be worried?

281
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,704
No, I'm not keeping it.
He thought it was still a car wash.

282
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:38,337
Did he?

283
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,439
That's good.
I mean, it's useful for now.

284
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,207
You clean enough cars,
you can make some money.

285
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:51,399
What I need you to do is to
tell me exactly what happened.

286
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,039
Now, don't leave out any detail,

287
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,119
no matter how insignificant it may seem.

288
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,359
Like starting when?

289
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,999
From when you decided to
take part in the protest.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,285
Well, I didn't really decide.
It was sort of decided for me.

291
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,279
Yes! Yes, we can use that.
No, we can't.

292
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,679
Dad thinks I'm an eco-warrior.
And you're not?

293
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,599
Oh, only an accidental one.

294
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:14,959
Accidental is exactly what it is!

295
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,759
If the prosecution think
you intentionally made

296
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,999
the front-end loader roll down the hill,

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,639
they will have to prove it.

298
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,479
Helena?
Yes?

299
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,919
How bad is this?

300
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:31,159
Mr Hughes is a silk.
He's had a lot of experience.

301
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,440
Much more than anyone I've
ever worked with before.

302
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:38,930
My darling girl

303
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,279
I am going to prepare the best brief

304
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,239
that Mr Hughes has ever seen.

305
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,559
I'm going to dot every I, cross every T

306
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,685
and we're going to kick their

307
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
bottom.

308
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:56,599
I didn't know which one
I should wear to court.

309
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:59,025
Which one do you usually wear?

310
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:01,119
I started the year in this.

311
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,599
Then, six months ago, I changed to this.

312
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,839
And how did that feel?

313
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,809
I was so scared.

314
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:09,679
How were the other kids?

315
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,959
Not good. Sort of weird.

316
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,453
But the principal said
something at assembly.

317
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,623
From then on, things got better.

318
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,920
So, why did you keep the boy's uniform?

319
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,679
Mum and Dad came over
from Malaysia to visit.

320
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay, so

321
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:30,719
which one?

322
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,053
Good choice. This is pretty.

323
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:43,327
My lucky charm.

324
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,241
This is going to be hard,

325
00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:48,760
but try not to worry about your father.

326
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,247
I'm all right.

327
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,159
Come on. You can come through.
Just keep

328
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,119
I'll be right behind you.

329
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,639
Edgeworth.
Hughes.

330
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,679
Well, this should be interesting.
It should.

331
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,240
Especially after Judge
Driscoll's farewell.

332
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,639
What was that about?
No idea.

333
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:23,679
This is an application
for court authorisation

334
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,359
to continue stage one treatment

335
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,839
for gender dysphoria for a child,
Sam Chen,

336
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,999
who is now 13 years old.

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,119
The court must authorise this treatment

338
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,239
as there is a dispute about its
need between the child's parents,

339
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,719
the child's uncle,
who is the first named applicant,

340
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,679
and the child,
who is seeking the treatment.

341
00:17:43,957 --> 00:17:46,933
In Sam's interest,
let's keep things civil.

342
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:50,943
Mr Hughes.

343
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:53,880
It's been some time since
you've appeared in my court.

344
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,280
I appear for the applicant,
Jiao Chen, the child's uncle.

345
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,447
I appear for the child, Sam.

346
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,439
And I appear for the respondent parents,

347
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,719
Gang and Ying Chen, who've travelled
from their home in Malaysia.

348
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,399
Imagine their shock, Your Honour,

349
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,199
when they received an online newsletter

350
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,639
from their son's school
just a few short months ago

351
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,199
with a photograph of the girls'
volleyball team,

352
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,319
and there,
to their utter amazement, was Sam.

353
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,599
Your Honour, my learned
friend seems to have a problem

354
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,337
with premature rhetoric.

355
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:31,479
Not an issue for you,
I'm sure,

356
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,367
Mr Hughes.

357
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:37,199
You'll have plenty of opportunity
to embroider later, Mr Edgeworth.

358
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,040
Let's just start at the beginning.

359
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,600
That was fast.

360
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,319
Basic wash?

361
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,639
Or I could do you a good
deal on full detailing.

362
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,039
I'm looking for Chatterjee & Chatterjee.

363
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,279
You after a lawyer?

364
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,439
The note I received said it was
in the basement, next to the lift.

365
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,559
Yeah, it's right through there.
Do you have an appointment?

366
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:26,999
I thought you washed cars.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,359
Oh, I do both. I'm an entrepreneur.

368
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,015
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
I didn't give it.

369
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:40,536
My name is Skye Stewart.
I'm with United Trustees Insurance.

370
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,679
I'm looking into the claim against
your client, Callum Docker.

371
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,599
$197,000.

372
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,519
The car has been declared a
write-off due to criminal damage,

373
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,279
so full replacement
value will be sought.

374
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,599
Oh, that's bullshit.
Typical insurance company.

375
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,039
You get some sucker
to pay the full value,

376
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,279
then you sell off the wreck,
they pay you,

377
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,639
then it turns out it's
not a write-off after all.

378
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,879
They knock out a few dents and sell it.

379
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,799
Looks like more than a few dents.

380
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,959
I'm about to head out
to the incident site,

381
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,239
so I can send you more detailed photos.

382
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,508
Oh, what are you? Like an investigator?

383
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,119
I look into our claims, yes.

384
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,234
Well,
I do all the investigating around here.

385
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:26,238
And I'll be taking me own photographs.

386
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:10,279
My client's position is simple

387
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,639
Sam is a girl and Sam
has always been a girl,

388
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,559
but through an error of biology,

389
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,599
she's found herself
living in a boy's body.

390
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,039
She was diagnosed with gender dysphoria

391
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,279
over eight months ago.

392
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,999
She's lived the requisite
six months as a girl

393
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,959
before starting treatment to
suppress the onset of puberty.

394
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,079
The court has the psychiatrist's report

395
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,519
confirming that diagnosis.

396
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,479
Yes, Your Honour, but somebody
forgot to notify the parents.

397
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,479
However, Mr Hughes's client
was the legal guardian

398
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,919
at the relevant time, Mr Edgeworth.

399
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,907
I seek leave to call Sam.

400
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:54,487
How long have you felt like a girl?
For as long as I can remember.

401
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:58,959
How far back are we talking?
When you were 10 or eight?

402
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,713
Um, four or five.
When we were living in China.

403
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:06,194
Do you remember a particular
time when you felt like a girl?

404
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,679
When Mum let me wear her cheongsams.

405
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,799
They were packed away at
the top of the cupboard,

406
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,439
but for Spring Festival,
she would bring them down.

407
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,438
She let you try on her dresses?

408
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:27,319
Now, you say you can remember
back to being a child of four,

409
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,359
or perhaps five, back in China?

410
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,440
Yes.

411
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:34,190
Right, let's see if I can ask you
to remember some more recent events.

412
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:38,799
When did you first learn
about gender dysphoria?

413
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,230
I don't remember. It's just what I have.

414
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:44,879
Okay. And when did your uncle
first take you to the doctor?

415
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,159
It was eight months ago?
Yes.

416
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,239
And that doctor referred
you to the gender clinic.

417
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,851
Is that correct?
Yes.

418
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:54,239
And then the clinic encouraged you

419
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,031
to see your problem as gender dysphoria?

420
00:22:57,217 --> 00:22:59,919
Yes, they helped me to understand.

421
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,086
And the clinic recommended
hormone treatment?

422
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:04,079
Yes.

423
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,748
Now, tell me, that first doctor,
was he a friend of your uncle's?

424
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,646
He's a psychiatrist.

425
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,548
But is he your uncle's friend?

426
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,276
He used to live next door.

427
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,158
So, your uncle sent you to a friend,
who sent you to the gender clinic,

428
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:27,039
who recommended hormone treatment

429
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,559
that your uncle approved
of by signing the forms?

430
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,599
Yes, but he didn't at first.

431
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:36,320
I had to beg him.
Thank you, Sam.

432
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,919
The reason why I was sent to
the doctor in the first place

433
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,082
wasn't about being a girl.

434
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,160
It was because I wanted to hurt myself.

435
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,319
And that's when I was
sent to the psychiatrist

436
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,959
and he wanted to know what was wrong.

437
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,000
Yes, thank you.

438
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,759
And my uncle only signed the
forms because I begged him to.

439
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,880
Thank you, Sam.

440
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:02,127
Your Honour,
I seek to cross-examine Doctor Christou.

441
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,759
Um, Your Honour,
a detailed report has been tabled.

442
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,519
There's a clear and
unequivocal diagnosis

443
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,799
of gender dysphoria.

444
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,098
And I seek clarification
on a few minor points.

445
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:16,120
The court will organise a time
for Doctor Christou to appear.

446
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,639
Chassis's fine.

447
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,600
I know people who could fix this easy.

448
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,119
Your company's seriously
going to try and get 200 grand

449
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,119
off a 15-year-old girl?

450
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,479
No, they're going after her father.
Same thing. That's pretty low.

451
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,599
Just doing my job.

452
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
Yeah, some job.

453
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,439
Insurance companies
they're all in the blame business.

454
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,799
Mm-hm.

455
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,560
And you're their stooge.
Yeah.

456
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,039
Really?

457
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,119
I think you've got a
focus problem there

458
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:06,184
Johnny.

459
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,590
You better not be taking
a picture of my arse.

460
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,000
Nah!

461
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,439
So, this is where the
front-end loader was parked?

462
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,919
Right here.
Mm-hm.

463
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,559
I need to see some building plans.
What for?

464
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,999
My company told me you
would cooperate fully.

465
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,519
If that isn't the case, let me know now

466
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,119
and I can make some phone calls.

467
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,199
They're all in the site office.

468
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,799
You people do my head in.

469
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,879
So so, that's it? Are we done?

470
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,860
Unless my fellow investigator
has any questions.

471
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:44,560
I'm good.
Then we're good.

472
00:25:46,081 --> 00:25:48,359
Mrs Chen,
you say you have no memory

473
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,959
of helping Sam to dress
in your cheongsams?

474
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:55,639
Perhaps once or twice, he wore them.

475
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,026
When they're very young,
all children love to dress up,

476
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,886
but I never help him.

477
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:03,759
So, Sam's lying?
No, no.

478
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,559
He just not remember clearly.
He was so little then.

479
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:09,519
Where did you keep them?

480
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,771
Um, in a chest on top
of the bedroom cupboard.

481
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:14,959
Locked away, I hope.

482
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,830
Your Honour, where is this going?

483
00:26:16,912 --> 00:26:18,504
Mrs Chen?

484
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,981
Yes, with a brass key, I keep safe.

485
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:28,999
So, this locked chest would have
been impossible for Sam to open,

486
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,639
given that she was so young and
so little, as you've described,

487
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:35,913
even if she was able to climb
up into the high cupboard.

488
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,800
Perhaps.

489
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:42,479
So, are you sure that you
didn't assist Sam, Mrs Chen?

490
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,279
Because you knew that it made her
so happy to wear your cheongsams.

491
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,559
It it was just dressing up.
Nothing more.

492
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:55,123
Thank you, Mrs Chen.

493
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,269
I love my son.

494
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,672
Everything I've ever done has
been only thinking of him

495
00:27:04,775 --> 00:27:06,449
of him living a better life.

496
00:27:06,573 --> 00:27:09,359
And now what is his
future if he does this?

497
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:11,079
Jiao

498
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,879
talk to him.

499
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,082
Make him see sense.

500
00:27:15,248 --> 00:27:18,513
Tell him this is all your doing.
Please, Mr Chen.

501
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:20,497
This is all your fault.

502
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:24,280
You did this to shame me,
to drag our name through the mud.

503
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:27,719
Here, across the ocean,
your shame follows us.

504
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,920
He loves men,

505
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:31,319
and now look what ideas
Sam has in his head.

506
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,559
Your Honour,
sexual orientation has nothing to do

507
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,988
with gender dysphoria.

508
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,303
Yep, that will do, Mr Chen.

509
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:41,333
We'll adjourn for the day
and resume tomorrow at 10.

510
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,919
My clerk wants to book me

511
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,279
for a certain case of
environmental terrorism

512
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,679
sorry, criminal damage

513
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,959
but my client seems to be 15 years old.

514
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,559
Yeah.
It's Lydia who's in trouble, not Callum.

515
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,999
The kid?
Mm.

516
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
So, she's a chip off the old block.

517
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,319
Yeah, Callum's delighted.

518
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,279
I meant you.

519
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,764
Um, sorry.

520
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,199
Um, I'm just checking in.
Is everything okay?

521
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,679
It's Helena you should worry about.

522
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,119
She's pacing round the office,

523
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,399
talking to herself and hyperventilating.

524
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,359
I think I pushed her over the edge.

525
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,319
No, Helena's just never briefed a
senior counsel before, that's all.

526
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,359
Sorry, I have to go.

527
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,639
Don't worry, Helena is

528
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,294
She's brilliant!

529
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,560
"Chatterjee & Chatterjee."

530
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:19,959
Can I help you?
Forget something?

531
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,239
Yes,
I forgot to ask which one are you?

532
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,278
Are you Chatterjee or Chatterjee?

533
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,572
Chatterjee.

534
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:33,644
Look, I can talk you through
No. No, no, no, I get it.

535
00:29:33,768 --> 00:29:38,431
You found a way to keep doing your
bleeding-heart cases downstairs

536
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:40,199
while your career heads upstairs.

537
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,719
No, that's not the way it is at all.

538
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,313
Well, yes, it is.
Yeah, that's exactly how it is.

539
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,079
Does Whitley know?
Of course not.

540
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,770
He already thinks I'm flaky.

541
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:52,671
Is that Eric Whitley?

542
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,359
That's his car.

543
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,879
According to what's in the glove box,
anyway.

544
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,199
He's coming down here to pick it up.

545
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,147
Now?
Mm-hm.

546
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,736
Oh, shit! Quickly! Get inside!
Go, go, go! After you! After you!

547
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,199
Fancy grabbing a bowl of pasta?

548
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,399
Not tonight, thank you.

549
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,919
All right, then, Japanese.

550
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,600
Eric!
What?

551
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,719
Well,
I don't understand the problem. I

552
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,319
I am a free man, unencumbered.

553
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,639
Yes, yes, yes,
and I'm very happy for you.

554
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,439
But you can't just presume

555
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,639
that I'm going to
automatically be there for you

556
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,348
whenever you want.

557
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,040
I don't think I presumed

558
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,999
I'm I'm I'm your bit on the side.

559
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,039
That's the way it's always been.

560
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,079
I don't want things to turn domestic.

561
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,247
Is that so complicated?

562
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,616
No, I suppose not.

563
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,845
Goodnight, Mr Whitley.

564
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,000
Goodnight, Ms Russo.

565
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:11,839
There you go. All done.

566
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,878
And you call me devious.

567
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:16,919
How much of your attention is
Knox Chambers going to get?

568
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,599
Would you like to put
a percentage on that?

569
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,040
Mm-hm. Nothing less than 100%. Shh!

570
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,933
That's not Lydia.

571
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,399
No!

572
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,199
She's

573
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,399
She's old enough to be
charged with criminal damage.

574
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,309
Coast is clear.

575
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,199
The prosecution will,
of course, argue intent,

576
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,399
based on Lydia's association
with the protesters

577
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,239
and her activist pedigree.

578
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,999
I have outlined a number of
defence strategies and precedents

579
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,959
all suggestions, of course

580
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,879
and a number of alternative arguments

581
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,279
as to why Lydia was in the
cabin of the front-end loader.

582
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,599
Was it for the view,
perhaps to stay warm,

583
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,759
or was it mere curiosity?

584
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,439
And for all we know

585
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,439
the driver left the handbrake off,

586
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,199
which endangered
everyone at the protest.

587
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,440
Curiosity is not a crime,
but it could have killed Lydia.

588
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,359
That's good.
Thank you.

589
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,560
Great work, Helena.

590
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:27,599
I like the signature
bounce off the back foot.

591
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,239
You've obviously had
impeccable training.

592
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,559
I have.

593
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,999
I will collate it all,
tie it with a ribbon

594
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,679
and send it upstairs.

595
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,967
This could even be winnable.

596
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:40,095
So, no teardrop tattoo?

597
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:44,001
Definitely takes after you.

598
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:46,080
Scusa.

599
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:50,599
They are a dynamite combination.

600
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,159
Lewis is brilliant, Helena is brilliant,

601
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,959
and she loves you to bits.

602
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,519
You should feel really confident.
I am.

603
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,119
If there's anything else
you want to tell me

604
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,120
I left my jacket.
Lydia!

605
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:42,869
I'll go!

606
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,079
Dinner!

607
00:33:50,537 --> 00:33:52,599
Ooh, great news!

608
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,039
Oh, hey, Josie. Mwah!
Just had to show Lydia this, okay?

609
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,199
You will not believe the response.
It is amazing. Look at this.

610
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,879
Crowdfunding campaign to raise
money for the legal costs.

611
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,680
Huh? Check it out!
This is some people power at work.

612
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,720
Read this. Read this.

613
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,519
You're right on track.
You're making it about Sam.

614
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,079
You're making it about how the parents

615
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,842
won't let her be her real self.

616
00:34:24,945 --> 00:34:27,519
Keep that father under
cross-examination tomorrow.

617
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,471
The more he says, the better.

618
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:31,599
I still don't get why you're
not acting for Sam yourself.

619
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,479
It looks better coming
from someone like you.

620
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,399
Someone like me?
Yes. Someone with kids.

621
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,979
Someone warm. Someone mumsy.

622
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:41,159
Oh, I'm mumsy!
You're a mother.

623
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,959
You're on the mumsy scale.
You're on the spectrum.

624
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,698
Whereas me no kids, no credentials.

625
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,119
What's with you and the judge?
It's safe to say there's history.

626
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,200
Because?

627
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:55,279
Because things might
have got a little untidy

628
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,359
at Judge Driscoll's farewell.

629
00:34:58,024 --> 00:34:59,574
Untidy?

630
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,159
Like I said, I'm not sure.
Some of that night is blurry.

631
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,519
I remember we were talking and
I was in a very agreeable mood.

632
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:10,159
Agreeable?

633
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,639
Gloria might have been a little tipsy

634
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,222
and perhaps she mistook my
general friendliness as flirting.

635
00:35:18,677 --> 00:35:21,759
You hit on a judge?
Not intentionally.

636
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,759
It was more of a misunderstanding.

637
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,599
But how do I explain the
lack of follow-through?

638
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,199
Do I say, "Gloria, I wasn't flirting,"

639
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,319
and then, what, I insult her?

640
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,441
Am I saying,
"You're not worthy of flirting with?"

641
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,769
You know? You see my dilemma.

642
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,879
Just let her live in hope,
at least until this case is over.

643
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,480
Yep. And then what?

644
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,720
After that, you're on your own.

645
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:04,911
Um, can I get a lift?
This can't get bent.

646
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,559
That art project was due two days ago.

647
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,159
Well, yeah,
thanks for the reminder, Mum.

648
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,199
That's why you went on
the protest with Dad.

649
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,599
I needed more time.

650
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,359
It's a major work and Mrs Feeney
wouldn't give me an extension.

651
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,879
Who's Mitch?
You saw my phone?

652
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,999
Was he the driver of
the front-end loader?

653
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,279
He was hot and wearing
a flannelette shirt.

654
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:30,919
Don't tell Dad.
He thinks I did it for the environment.

655
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,999
So, he invited her up into the cabin.

656
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,039
He did.
And he's over 18. An adult.

657
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,240
19 years old.

658
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,959
Good.
That'll play well in court.

659
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,160
Mm.

660
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,066
And do we know what happened
in the cabin of the bulldozer?

661
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,239
Nothing criminal.
Thank God.

662
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,479
That smart-arse chick
from the insurance company

663
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,221
wants to see ya!

664
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,799
I actually came here
to get my car washed.

665
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,119
We're full.

666
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,064
But while I'm here, I wanted to
raise a hypothetical situation.

667
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:05,119
Go ahead.

668
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,405
Let's say, hypothetically,
I came across new information

669
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:15,679
and that shed light on a
fundamental aspect of this case.

670
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,719
And that aspect would be?

671
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,437
Another reason the
front-end loader rolled.

672
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,800
We're listening.

673
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:25,728
Let's say I raised this
information with my boss

674
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:28,279
and was asked to ignore it.

675
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,359
Ethically,
I can't share this information with you.

676
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,759
And what information
are we talking about?

677
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,728
I can't share that, specifically,

678
00:37:36,852 --> 00:37:42,159
but I have a great deal of
photographic information.

679
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,759
If your own investigator, Mr Allbright,

680
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,881
is half as good as he thinks he is,
he would be way ahead of me.

681
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:52,000
Hope I don't see you in court.

682
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:59,016
I like that girl.
She has a lot of integrity.

683
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:04,399
Among other attributes.

684
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,479
What's that machinery?
Oh, just some kind of pump.

685
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,759
Like a water pump?

686
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,919
What would they be
doing with a water pump?

687
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,230
Oh, no one's likely to cough up to us.

688
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:18,620
Except maybe one person.

689
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,439
Mitch Winners?
Winters.

690
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,404
Who's he?
He's the hot guy from the cabin.

691
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,039
I'm not supposed to talk to anyone.
I'm in enough trouble as it is.

692
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,608
Oh, that's not very friendly, Mitch.

693
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,143
It's about this pump.

694
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,919
The one that's disappeared now.
I don't know anything, man.

695
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,399
I'm just trying to keep my head down.

696
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,039
Hey, five minutes and I'm out of here.

697
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:50,708
Otherwise

698
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,899
we could talk about this.

699
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,199
Where did you get that?
Wrong question.

700
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,547
What you should ask is how
you can make it go away.

701
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,479
We began treatment with leuprorelin

702
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,519
to suppress the onset of male puberty.

703
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,359
And what would you
expect to happen to Sam

704
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,439
if she were to stop
taking the leuprorelin?

705
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,479
Puberty would start.

706
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,119
Her testosterone levels would rise.
Her voice would break.

707
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,884
And what effect do you anticipate
this would have on Sam?

708
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:24,119
It would be devastating.

709
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,519
Once her voice breaks,
it will be irreversible.

710
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,120
Did Sam ever mention suicide to you,
Doctor Christou?

711
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,850
Indirectly, yes.

712
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,599
I'm sorry,
I wasn't aware Sam would be here.

713
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,239
That's all right, Doctor.

714
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,119
During one session,
I asked Sam what her life would be like

715
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,300
if it wasn't possible to live as a girl.

716
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:50,719
She told me her life would be
and I'm quoting

717
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,999
very unhappy and very short.

718
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,679
So, you feared for Sam's well-being?
Yes.

719
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,941
And yet at no point did
you contact Sam's parents.

720
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,879
I was dealing with her uncle,
her legal guardian.

721
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,688
Didn't Sam's parents have a
right to know if, as you say,

722
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:18,561
their child was suicidal?

723
00:40:18,974 --> 00:40:20,919
That wasn't my decision.

724
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,560
No, it wasn't.

725
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:35,350
Mr Chen, do you understand that,
in this case,

726
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,450
it will be up to the court to
decide what's best for Sam,

727
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:41,199
even if that goes against your wishes?

728
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:43,287
But I am Sam's father.

729
00:40:43,452 --> 00:40:46,639
So, do you accept the
authority of this court or not?

730
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,999
Um, Your Honour, relevance.

731
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:52,079
I'd like to know, Mr Edgeworth.

732
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,599
I know what is best for my son.

733
00:40:54,723 --> 00:40:59,359
Based on your personal values.
Based on what I think is right.

734
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:02,598
Mm-hm. That's all, Your Honour.

735
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,760
Your Honour, if I can just
clarify something with my witness?

736
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:06,919
Go ahead.

737
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,359
Mr Chen,
so the court has a better picture

738
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,719
of your personal values,

739
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,960
could you tell us the circumstances
that led to your leaving China?

740
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,967
My brother shamed the family.

741
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:25,696
Jiao was caught with
another boy from our town

742
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:29,279
and, um,
our father threw him out of the house.

743
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:35,830
And Jiao had to report to a
clinic to treat his sickness,

744
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:38,519
and they gave him electric shocks.

745
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:43,999
Now, you both fled China to
Malaysia where you supported Jiao,

746
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,039
and gave him a job in your business.

747
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,239
Yes.
But you didn't have to leave China.

748
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,270
So, why did you go?

749
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:54,791
To protect Jiao.

750
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,738
I love my brother.

751
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:01,239
I couldn't let them do
those things to him.

752
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,719
So, we had to leave,
and we brought Jiao with us.

753
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,319
So, you didn't approve of your brother,

754
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,959
but you didn't try to change him.

755
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,433
Instead, you sacrificed your
happy life in your homeland.

756
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:17,559
Because nothing is more
important than family.

757
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,359
I I don't

758
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,494
I've changed my mind.
I don't want to do this.

759
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,079
Um, I'm sorry, Your Honour, my

760
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,359
We're close enough to lunch.
Go after your client.

761
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,368
Thank you, Your Honour.

762
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,241
Sam?

763
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,920
Sam?

764
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,679
I don't want to do this anymore.

765
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,159
I know it's distressing,
but we're nearly done.

766
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,258
We're nearly finished.

767
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,799
Sam, your mum's here. Sam?

768
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,519
Go away, please.

769
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,719
Sam, I just want to see you,
make sure you're all right.

770
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,443
Please!

771
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,295
Show your mum your arm.

772
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,159
Shanmu!

773
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,936
I'm sorry!

774
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,155
Let me speak to my husband.

775
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,559
Sam, can I have a word?

776
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,919
Get some lunch and take some
time to think this through.

777
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,050
I won't change my mind.

778
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,720
See you back in the courtroom.

779
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,839
Do we still have a case?

780
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,840
By the skin of our teeth,
if my mumsy instincts are right.

781
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,259
I don't have long.

782
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,999
Car park log?
Stationery's on the shopping list.

783
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,200
Okay, what am I looking at?

784
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,784
Planning documents from
the development site.

785
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:27,599
Johnny followed up on the tip-off
from the insurance company.

786
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,919
With the hot guy from
the development site.

787
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,399
Oh, darling.

788
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,639
Then I went to the
Department of Planning

789
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,239
and requested the paperwork.

790
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,119
There are at least five breaches

791
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,879
of the terms of the
planning order in here.

792
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,999
Yeah, the water table issue alone
could have stalled the development.

793
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Perhaps even stop it.

794
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,599
That's Laurie Trencherman.
I think you should sit in.

795
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,719
No, Helena, he's all yours.
But don't forget a little

796
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,079
A little bit of Latin goes a long way.

797
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Luce lux vestra let your light shine.

798
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,279
None of this has anything to do

799
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,959
with little Missy here totalling my car.

800
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,319
Well, it does

801
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,399
if the front-end loader was
parked on unstable land.

802
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,366
That's not why it rolled.

803
00:45:15,531 --> 00:45:18,679
Well,
I put it to you it is why it rolled.

804
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,400
I have your foreman's interim report

805
00:45:24,816 --> 00:45:26,879
in which he expresses his concerns

806
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,320
about both the site management
and building construction.

807
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,359
All I have to do is write a
letter enclosing this report

808
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,639
and asking for a nolle prosequi.

809
00:45:43,301 --> 00:45:44,119
In English?

810
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,439
Unless you drop all the charges,
we'll kick your arse.

811
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,599
Yes!

812
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,040
Are you sure about this?
Sam gives me no choice.

813
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,720
Sam?
She wants us to withdraw.

814
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,873
All rise. Court is now in session.

815
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,679
Your Honour, if I may
Just wait a minute.

816
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,126
What did you do?
I apologise, Your Honour.

817
00:46:21,354 --> 00:46:23,639
Mrs Chen has requested to be recalled.

818
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,399
I've advised her against this,

819
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,939
but she's given me very
clear instructions.

820
00:46:29,063 --> 00:46:30,820
I have no objection to that,
Your Honour.

821
00:46:30,923 --> 00:46:31,956
Ms Newton?

822
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,003
Of course, no objection.

823
00:46:37,413 --> 00:46:40,719
In this box are things I kept for Sam.

824
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,599
Things to remember his childhood,
and us where he come from.

825
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,083
I brought them with me to
Australia to give to him because

826
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:57,263
I'm sorry.

827
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:01,025
Because I thought I never see him again.

828
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,562
There are trinkets, um, keepsakes,

829
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:10,960
and, um, drawings.

830
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:15,599
Drawings he used to do
when he was a little boy,

831
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,744
when we lived home in China.

832
00:47:20,563 --> 00:47:24,600
Drawings I should have burned, but
I couldn't.

833
00:47:26,502 --> 00:47:29,280
They're beautiful. May I?

834
00:47:32,124 --> 00:47:33,653
There you are.

835
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,679
Sam did want to dress
up in girl clothes.

836
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:40,639
Always.

837
00:47:41,342 --> 00:47:45,120
He very upset when he
have to dress like boy.

838
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,559
Could you tell me what this says?

839
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,519
Shanmu. That's Sam's name.

840
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,759
And

841
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,258
"When I am girl."

842
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,279
He used to say that he was,
um, caterpillar,

843
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:06,719
and that he have to stay hiding,

844
00:48:07,288 --> 00:48:09,540
but one day, he would be

845
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:12,400
a butterfly.

846
00:48:13,736 --> 00:48:15,640
And now he is.

847
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:19,027
She is.

848
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,359
A beautiful motor car.

849
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,523
A proper motor car.
That, it is. Wish it was mine.

850
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:34,520
One day, eh?
One day.

851
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:40,719
So,
balancing the wishes of the child

852
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,573
against the lack of parents' consent,

853
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:48,104
I make the final order that the child,
Sam Chen,

854
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:51,999
is authorised to continue
stage one hormone treatment.

855
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,199
I make an order that Sam's uncle,
Jiao Chen,

856
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,759
shall have sole parental responsibility

857
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,241
for the child's medical treatment
related to gender dysphoria.

858
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,600
Thank you.

859
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,962
Congratulations.
Thank you.

860
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,799
Was that a win?

861
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,759
Sam gets to keep being herself.
For now.

862
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,239
And loses her family.

863
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,792
You don't feel like sugar-coating that?

864
00:49:44,896 --> 00:49:46,508
You're a big girl.

865
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,978
My work here is done.

866
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:57,872
Ah, Johnny, there is always more work.

867
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,910
If you had a car, I'd wash it.

868
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:02,439
That is the loveliest thing

869
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,199
anyone has said to me
in quite some time.

870
00:50:05,808 --> 00:50:07,599
Goodnight, Johnny.

871
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,639
And thank you!

872
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,439
How did you go?
She was triumphant.

873
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,560
Good work.

874
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:17,279
Um, hold the lift for me, Lewis.

875
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,679
I meant to ask,
the car wash downstairs

876
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,999
did they do a good job?

877
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,080
Fine.

878
00:50:22,081 --> 00:50:23,839
Yeah, I might give them a whirl.
Goodnight.

879
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,653
Goodnight!

880
00:50:24,777 --> 00:50:27,240
So, you're not going to tell Whitley?

881
00:50:28,014 --> 00:50:30,845
No. Why would I? I'd get the blame.

882
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,840
Well, you could plead ignorance.

883
00:50:34,152 --> 00:50:38,120
Nah. This way, I keep the upper hand.

884
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:42,130
As long as I get first dibs
on that legal brain of yours.

885
00:50:42,233 --> 00:50:45,080
Yeah, for what it's worth.

886
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,439
Oh, I'd say it's worth quite a lot.

887
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,091
Evening.

888
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,600
No need to be so formal.

889
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,800
Well, I just didn't want to presume.

890
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,200
Ah.

891
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:17,039
Now, I hear you have a clean car.

892
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,439
Is that right?
Immaculate.

893
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,039
Yeah? Yeah?
Well, you and I could go for a drive.

894
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,559
Where to?
Anywhere you want.

895
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,760
Oh! Oh! Oh.

896
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,599
Oh, hey,
the possums of Park Vale thank you.

897
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,880
Cheers.

898
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,920
You have to come clean.
Tell him.

899
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,479
Dad?
Mm.

900
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,079
I just wanted to talk to you

901
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,439
I am so proud of you, you know that?
Mm-hm.

902
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,879
So proud of you.

903
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,799
You did a really good thing.
Mm.

904
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,119
This could be the start of
something amazing, you know?

905
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,080
I couldn't tell him, Mum.
He's way too happy.

906
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,879
And from that moment until the
next morning when you woke up,

907
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,159
you can't remember a thing?

908
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,559
First day?
Don't worry, I'm a tight unit.

909
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,439
Minimalist. You'll hardly notice me.

910
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,046
You can't roam around here in
your socks. It's undignified.

911
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:16,999
There's no more old clients.
We've sorted 'em all out.

912
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,839
My dad needs a lawyer.
Great!

913
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,239
There's no way I'm going back to
live with that mob of ratbags.

914
00:53:23,016 --> 00:53:24,679
He really needs to win.

915
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,559
You're the only barrister I
know who'll do it for free.

916
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,319
Oh, thanks,
but I've got a murder trial on.

917
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,519
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
We had one job. One job!

918
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,839
I was going out with Cal
and he made a commitment.

919
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,559
Some men can't manage
that for a weekend.

920
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,479
What would make you go
back to a former partner?

921
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,634
I might go back for the kids.
Not because you loved him?
