1
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:30,578
Well, gentlemen, the dream has come true.

2
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,981
And not just for Republicans.

3
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,895
We will control the most powerful bomb
in the universe.

4
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:40,694
The sun.

5
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:45,137
When do we strike, not at a model...

6
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,136
...but at Washington itself?

7
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:50,178
We will strike within 10 days.

8
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,980
Thanks to our colleague here,
the first man ever...

9
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:56,899
...to break the security of American
Intelligence and Counter Espionage.

10
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:59,374
He has cracked the I.C.E., so to speak.

11
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:04,018
And now we have positive identification
of all their top agents.

12
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:14,344
These gentlemen have ceased to amuse me.

13
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,059
- Still their voices forever.
- What?

14
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,459
Kill them!

15
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,819
I'm cold.

16
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:30,014
Wait till you get your costume on.

17
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:37,622
Well, you're supposed to look cold.
You're Miss January.

18
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:39,775
What a way to start the year.

19
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,616
All right, honey, in front of the map.

20
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:48,500
Oh, I've never been to Minnesota.

21
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:52,180
You're there now and it's mighty cold,
so let me see those goosebumps.

22
00:06:52,265 --> 00:06:55,655
Oh, good girl. Now a little to the left.

23
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:02,381
- I want to catch you right near Duluth.
- Why, that's my best feature.

24
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:06,023
All right, now you just
lower your left arm...

25
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:09,302
...'cause we don't want to hide
the Twin Cities.

26
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:22,655
- Perfect.
- Oh, you're some tricky fellow.

27
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:25,942
- Well, I wanted to get the real you.
- It's all real.

28
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,664
- All right, you can change now.
- Well, was I all right?

29
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,658
Better than that. Usually I have trouble
with a new girl. But not you.

30
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:41,101
You can go out the back way.

31
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:43,614
What should I do with the costume?

32
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,376
Drop it in the ashtray.

33
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:05,215
- Good morning, Mr. Helm.
- Well, good morning, Lovey.

34
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:08,858
- Anything important?
- Just that letter from Mr. Graham.

35
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:11,857
It can wait. Have your
juice and coffee first.

36
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,499
There's nothing like fresh orange juice.

37
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:56,176
- Still on the calendar layout?
- Yeah.

38
00:08:56,265 --> 00:09:00,144
November and December
were here last night. Just finished January.

39
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:03,137
- And February's on the way.
- You look beat.

40
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:08,418
Well, I've had a rough winter.
Now where'd we leave off yesterday?

41
00:09:09,345 --> 00:09:13,657
"Dear Mr. Graham, thank you for
the kind offer to join your new magazine."

42
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:19,257
But after taking care of a few loose ends,
I plan an extended vacation.

43
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,704
I'm going to roam all over this
great big beautiful land of ours...

44
00:09:23,785 --> 00:09:27,141
...and explore every cranny and nook...

45
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:32,016
...and hill and dale
that I ever dreamed of in my youth.

46
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,624
Cordially...

47
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:38,418
No, make that warmly, yours.

48
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,821
And warmly yours.

49
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:04,019
Lovey, what's July doing here?
I haven't even buttoned up January.

50
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,300
That was April.
Spring will be a little late.

51
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:08,615
Good. I'm going in and lying down.

52
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:12,933
I'm July.

53
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:15,373
I believe it.

54
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:19,174
Lovey will show you your costume. We're
going to do the <i>Spirit of '76</i>.

55
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,381
Seventy-six? Are you kidding?

56
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:25,699
- I'm only a 44.
- Well, that's patriotic enough for me.

57
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,382
- Hello.
- Matt? MacDonald.

58
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:43,297
- Look, we're in a terrible jam.
- Well, so am I.

59
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:45,621
<i>- Matt, listen, you've...</i>
- I'm hanging up.

60
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:49,937
<i>- Matt, the situation is desperate.</i>
- You're telling me. February isn't here yet...

61
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,415
July is four months early,
and April's three months late.

62
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:59,261
Thirty days has September.

63
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:18,299
I got under the blankets to warm up.
January's such a cold month.

64
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:22,824
I never thought I'd live to say this, but
all I want to do is lie down here quietly.

65
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:25,703
I'm tired. Now be a good girl
and go on home.

66
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:29,576
Well, that's not the Matt Helm
I heard so much about.

67
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:32,020
It does seem a little ridiculous, doesn't it?

68
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:34,414
But I mean it.
Now you go on out like a lamb.

69
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:37,781
That's March.
I want to wish you a Happy New Year.

70
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:49,179
I'm glad you talked some sense into me.

71
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:52,659
What's this?

72
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,100
Now you've done it.
We're going to take the plunge.

73
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:59,383
Oh, I just had my hair done. Let me go!
I think I'd better walk in.

74
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,103
- Oh, no.
- Let go of me.

75
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:03,494
- We'll go in together.
- Let me go.

76
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:09,260
- Let me go, please.
- Not the Matt Helm you've heard of.

77
00:12:32,345 --> 00:12:33,937
Thank you, Furnas.

78
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:37,258
So long, Matt.

79
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:31,220
I just can't take any more, Lovey.

80
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:42,898
To Matt Helm.

81
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,735
- You're late.
- Thanks.

82
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,623
I'm sorry I missed my funeral. How'd it go?

83
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,783
Great. The tears
would have done your heart good.

84
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:31,538
Matt Helm is dead,
and he's going to stay dead.

85
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,061
- Now just a darn minute.
- That's direct from the White House, Matt.

86
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:38,421
- I ain't voting for him again.
- It's up to you.

87
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,935
Shall we look at some pictures?

88
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:51,943
- Your own drive-in movie.
- There's a car just like this waiting for you.

89
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,902
- Where?
- We'll get to it.

90
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:57,937
Hey, double feature.

91
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:21,975
That's the French Riviera, Matt.

92
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:26,742
- Cannes, to be exact.
- You're exact.

93
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,341
Hey, Valley of the Giants.

94
00:15:29,425 --> 00:15:33,862
That device they tried to kill you with
was developed by our own scientists, Matt.

95
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:37,460
It's called a helio-beam.
That's the man that invented it.

96
00:15:38,265 --> 00:15:42,417
- When did he find time?
- His name is Dr. Norman Solaris.

97
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:44,973
He's been vacationing on the Riviera.

98
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:49,133
How did you tear him away from the lab?

99
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,583
He's been working
on this invention for years.

100
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,014
And now he has a super helio-beam.

101
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:05,143
- I figured he had something.
- This beam can knock out an army, Matt...

102
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:09,662
...a city, a continent!
It can bring peace or complete annihilation.

103
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:12,815
It's a dreadful responsibility.

104
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:16,421
I can see it's weighing heavily on his mind.

105
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,338
Two days before he was supposed to meet
with the President...

106
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,655
...Solaris suddenly disappeared.

107
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:24,779
Defected, kidnapped, we don't know.

108
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:28,980
- Maybe he was just worn out.
- Just vanished without a trace.

109
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:31,101
Have you looked under any beds?

110
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:34,495
Matt, whoever has Solaris
is trying to build that beam.

111
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:38,621
- We haven't got much time.
- Any leads at all?

112
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:42,735
This is a rare type ore, Matt.

113
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:45,544
It's called helio-magnesium-X4.

114
00:16:47,985 --> 00:16:49,896
I liked the other measurements better.

115
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:53,534
This X4 is essential
to the operation of the super-beam.

116
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:57,698
There's a huge load of it on its way now
across the Mediterranean.

117
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:02,103
You find out its destination,
and we believe you'll find Solaris.

118
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:07,345
You'll be operating out of Monte Carlo.

119
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:11,539
- Mighty pretty country down around there.
- Her name is Dominique.

120
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,944
- You'll be working very closely with her.
- As close as I can get.

121
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:20,338
And by the way,
your name will be James A. Peters.

122
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:31,175
Matt, now I'm going to throw you a curve.
And it's a big one.

123
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:35,657
If you find Solaris, we want you
to get him out if you can, naturally.

124
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:40,183
But if you can't,
you're gonna have to kill him.

125
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:43,304
We can't risk what he knows
getting over to the enemy.

126
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:47,583
- Why do I always get the fun jobs?
- Because you're the only one I can trust.

127
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:52,064
Matt, for the first time, there's
been a break in the security in I.C.E.

128
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:54,454
There's a traitor among us. A double agent.

129
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:58,584
That's why only two people know
you're still alive. Me and the President.

130
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:01,418
And that's why you'll be operating
strictly on your own.

131
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:04,178
You can't even contact me.
You understand?

132
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:06,620
Right.

133
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,901
And, Matt, one other thing.

134
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:16,182
What I just said to you about Solaris
applies to you as well.

135
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:23,617
- I don't get you.
- Matt, they can brainwash a vacuum cleaner.

136
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:27,539
They'd have you killing for them,
you wouldn't even know you were doing it.

137
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,015
So if they grab you,
you get in a jam you can't get out...

138
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:33,938
I understand.

139
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,936
- Good boy.
- I ain't going.

140
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,218
Good old Mac.

141
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:53,024
<i>Put me down!</i>

142
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,898
<i>You don't have time to sit around drinking.</i>
<i>You've got work to do.</i>

143
00:19:59,505 --> 00:20:00,904
<i>Yes, it's me.</i>

144
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:04,784
Imagine doing that
to a beautiful bottle of booze.

145
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:07,902
<i>I figured this was the surest way</i>
<i>to get your orders to you.</i>

146
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:12,581
<i>Contact Dominique immediately.</i>
<i>Hotel du Gide, Avenue St. Germain.</i>

147
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,179
Shut up! I'll fix you, boy.

148
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:18,541
I'll join the AA,
and you won't have anybody to talk to.

149
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,134
You say one word and I'll kill you.

150
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:33,377
Now you're talking.

151
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:15,699
Stop it!

152
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:27,814
No matter how many times
I stare at the sun setting on the Riviera...

153
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:29,941
...it never fails to excite me.

154
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:34,062
Especially if a young girl with nothing on
is sitting there, too.

155
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:37,774
You can be such an angel.
And I may arrange it.

156
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:00,861
Mister. <i>Monsieur.</i>

157
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:03,413
- Mister will do.
- Got a little fire?

158
00:24:03,665 --> 00:24:05,337
Where shall I start?

159
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,933
I never forget a face.
I think I saw you in a movie, a drive-in.

160
00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:14,894
No, I work in a record shop.
Are you a friend of Dominique's?

161
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:18,855
Oh, no. A fellow from the States
asked me to say hello.

162
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:22,899
- I don't think she's in today.
- Oh, no. She's out.

163
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:27,259
- Thanks for the light.
- Don't mention it.

164
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:33,534
By the way, who shall I say was calling?

165
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:36,778
I don't think
it would mean very much to her.

166
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,134
Coco.

167
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:03,336
It is a beautiful sunset.
Now there's something for all of us to see.

168
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:02,094
After I graduated Yale,
Dad wanted me to come into the firm...

169
00:26:02,265 --> 00:26:04,825
...but I said,
"No! I want to make it on my own."

170
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:08,978
So he gave me $250,000
in traveller's cheques and here I am.

171
00:26:48,825 --> 00:26:50,497
Hi. Still looking?

172
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:53,816
Dominique hasn't come in yet.
I don't know where she is.

173
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:57,581
- This is dancing?
- It's called a discotheque. You want to try?

174
00:26:57,665 --> 00:26:59,303
Well, I don't disc.

175
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:11,782
Oh, that's great.
And you said you couldn't dance.

176
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:31,574
You'll break something. Up.

177
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,383
It's like directing traffic.

178
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:42,614
- No!
- No?

179
00:27:54,265 --> 00:27:57,143
Don't you think
we should be introduced first?

180
00:28:05,305 --> 00:28:08,058
- Hey, now you're swinging, dad.
- Dad?

181
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:11,299
- He calls everybody Dad.
- Don't he know?

182
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,818
It's a wise son who knows his own father.

183
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:17,701
The way they're wearing
their hair nowadays...

184
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:20,458
...it's a wise father who knows his own son.

185
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,778
He came here right from Dominique's
apartment. He's dancing with a girl now.

186
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,621
No, I have no idea who he is.

187
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:41,663
Maybe we'll find out afterwards,
from his widow.

188
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:44,461
- When did you see her last?
- Who?

189
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:51,460
You mean Dominique? I don't know.
Sometime today.

190
00:28:57,345 --> 00:28:58,414
Why?

191
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:31,744
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> we regret to
inform you, Dominique has been murdered.

192
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:34,104
- Dead?
- Yes, <i>mademoiselle</i>.

193
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:36,858
An American was seen
driving a Thunderbird.

194
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:01,580
I hate a guy that wears jewellery.

195
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:16,336
I must protest.

196
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:21,983
- Thanks for the help.
- An American?

197
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,378
Yeah. Why?

198
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:31,862
- You speak English?
- Very well.

199
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:33,697
- Yes.
- You're under arrest.

200
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:41,297
That's him. That's the man.
No doubt about it.

201
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,421
- You are positive?
- Absolutely.

202
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:46,542
He's the one we saw
leaving that poor woman's room.

203
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,058
Thank you, <i>Monsieur</i> Wall.

204
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:50,784
- And you, <i>madame?</i>
- Now just a doggone minute!

205
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:53,254
I got some rights, too.
I am an American citizen.

206
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:57,020
We will play the Star-Spangled Banner
when you're in the electric chair.

207
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,982
Then I have to stand up.

208
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:03,617
<i>Madame</i> Duquette,
can you identify this man?

209
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:04,854
She can.

210
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:07,576
Perhaps. Perhaps not.

211
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:12,619
Naturally, one wants to be sure.
A man's life is at stake.

212
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:18,814
The truth of the matter is,
I was watching the sunset.

213
00:31:19,865 --> 00:31:23,904
No matter how many times,
it never fails to excite me.

214
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:29,142
I really couldn't be sure.

215
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:31,898
You're a sweet, warm,
wonderful human being.

216
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:34,700
We still have one more witness.

217
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:38,138
What is this, Bastille Day?
You know, where I come from...

218
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:40,341
I have the right to be
picked out of a lineup.

219
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:41,983
And so you shall.

220
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:51,175
All right, line up over there.

221
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:55,221
Don't tell Mum about this.

222
00:31:57,305 --> 00:31:59,899
Here we are, Patty, Maxine, and LaVerne.

223
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:04,015
- We're ready, Captain. The girl is outside.
- Send her in.

224
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:07,619
She'll never be able to tell us apart.

225
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:22,100
Take your time, <i>mademoiselle</i>.
And do not be afraid.

226
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:24,058
Who's afraid?

227
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:32,504
It's not him.

228
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:38,424
It's not him.

229
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:42,137
Got a little fire?

230
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:53,463
It's not him, either.

231
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,415
Are you certain? Look again.

232
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:06,615
I'm positive. He's not the one.

233
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:10,940
How about you, <i>Monsieur</i> Orcutt?

234
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:15,421
I can't tell. I was under water
a good deal of the time.

235
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:21,143
I have never been surer of anything
in my life.

236
00:33:21,545 --> 00:33:24,981
Well, we're very civic-minded and all that,
but it is getting late...

237
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:27,374
...and if there's nothing else we can do here...

238
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,103
Good night, Captain.

239
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:31,900
Come along, Julian.

240
00:33:31,985 --> 00:33:35,739
Maybe we can find somebody for you
to run over on the way home.

241
00:33:38,665 --> 00:33:42,704
I must ask you to stay available to us,
<i>Monsieur</i> Peters.

242
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:48,423
Thanks, fellas. We made a great team.
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

243
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:50,097
<i>Bonsoir,</i> LaVerne!

244
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:52,540
No, I'm Maxine. That's LaVerne.

245
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,258
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

246
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:03,699
- Why did you lie?
- I have my reasons.

247
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:06,176
I don't want him in jail.

248
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:08,899
The visiting hours are so inconvenient.

249
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:11,936
But why did the girl lie?

250
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,257
I have to talk to you.
Meet me at my place in an hour. Okay?

251
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:22,975
Wait a minute. Hold it. Not so fast,
little girl. How come in there... How come?

252
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:28,622
At the pool today. When I said thanks for
the light, you said, "don't mention it".

253
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:30,503
- Yeah?
- So I didn't.

254
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,463
I just had to make sure, Billy.

255
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:40,697
A person doesn't want to make a mistake
about something as important as that.

256
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:50,299
Who is it?

257
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:53,183
- Your old dancing partner.
- Come in.

258
00:35:03,105 --> 00:35:04,743
Cute place you got here.

259
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:17,663
I've been waiting for you.

260
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:32,339
The room service ain't bad, either.

261
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:36,975
I want you to come over to my side.

262
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:41,936
- I'll make it worth your while.
- You already have.

263
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:49,374
She hired you, didn't she?

264
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:51,383
She had you kill Dominique.

265
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:53,581
- Who?
- Who?

266
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:55,933
Coco Duquette.

267
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,820
You've done other jobs for her, haven't you?

268
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:01,465
- Well, if you say so.
- Where's Norman?

269
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:05,618
- Norman?
- Come on, you owe me one.

270
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:09,101
- Norman Solaris. Where is he?
- I never heard of him.

271
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:11,776
All right, get out of here.

272
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:15,661
Now I know why you took me off the hook
with the police.

273
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:20,215
You thought I knew something
about this fellow, Solaris.

274
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:21,779
That's right.

275
00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:23,344
What's he to you?

276
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:25,696
What's the difference?

277
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,980
Look, Coco had something to do with this.

278
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:31,420
She's a bad guy,
and she's capable of anything.

279
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:34,815
And what are you?
You think I'm a murderer...

280
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:38,342
...you lie to the police on a chance
that you'll find your boyfriend...

281
00:36:38,425 --> 00:36:40,381
He is not my boyfriend!

282
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:44,255
Norman Solaris is my father.

283
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,623
He's never wanted it known. Vanity, I guess.

284
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:52,053
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but I don't know anything about it.

285
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,783
Now you figure it out for yourself.

286
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:56,140
If this Coco girl hired me to do the job...

287
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:58,944
...she wouldn't have shown up
at the police station.

288
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:02,813
And I ain't no murderer.
Now, what makes you so positive she is?

289
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:05,624
Jealousy, revenge.

290
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:08,613
My father and Dominique
were good friends for a while.

291
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:11,822
Then Coco came along.
Coco wanted him for Coco.

292
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,024
She really fell for him?

293
00:37:14,105 --> 00:37:18,178
He was here on vacation. Vacations end.
Coco didn't want it to.

294
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:21,218
Look, maybe I'm all wrong.
He can take care of himself.

295
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:22,977
Only this time...

296
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:26,978
I don't know. I've got the funniest feeling
that she's mixed up in it somehow.

297
00:37:27,065 --> 00:37:29,818
I figure that if anybody's the heavy...

298
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:32,778
...it's her husband, that <i>Monsieur</i> Wall.

299
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:34,623
They're not married.

300
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:38,137
You mean they hate each other like that
for nothing?

301
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:41,104
She and Julian Wall have been together
for years.

302
00:37:41,185 --> 00:37:43,540
She flaunts her little side trips
in front of him.

303
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:46,378
- I think it's part of the arrangement.
- Nice people.

304
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,580
Rich people.

305
00:37:47,905 --> 00:37:50,135
That island out there, he owns it.

306
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:52,096
Shipyards, boats, yachts.

307
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:55,296
- Barges?
- A whole fleet of them.

308
00:37:56,305 --> 00:37:58,421
I think I'll come over to your side.

309
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,581
I don't have very much to offer.

310
00:38:03,305 --> 00:38:06,456
- You're putting me on.
- I didn't mean...

311
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:09,296
I didn't think you did.

312
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:12,344
But we'll think of something.
In the meantime now...

313
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:15,144
...don't you go telling anybody
about your family tree...

314
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:17,864
...'cause whoever grabbed him
might grab you.

315
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:21,096
And if there's any grabbing
to be done around here...

316
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,024
I demand an explanation.

317
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:33,903
What is the meaning
of this nocturnal assignation?

318
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:36,621
Is he rehearsing for a play?

319
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:42,217
I think it's only fair to advise you, sir,
that I have boxed three years for Yale.

320
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:45,695
Well, I think that's very sporting of you
to warn me, old boy.

321
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:48,574
- Good night, Miss Magnolia.
- Good night.

322
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,737
I intend to stand guard here
for the rest of the evening.

323
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:55,215
Don't look at me. I'm going out
to place a big bet on Harvard.

324
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:32,502
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

325
00:39:32,785 --> 00:39:35,663
<i>If you try to escape, we will shoot.</i>

326
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,381
Well, welcome to Disneyland.

327
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:17,181
Forgive me, but I don't believe
I got your name at the police station.

328
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:19,142
Peters. Jim Peters.

329
00:40:19,345 --> 00:40:21,939
I sell American postcards. No offence.

330
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:24,297
What are you doing here?

331
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:26,615
To tell you the truth,
I was having a barbecue.

332
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:28,423
I ran out of charcoal.

333
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:43,944
I am going to keep doing that
every time I hear an answer I don't like.

334
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:46,137
Shall we try again?

335
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,581
What are you doing here?

336
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:51,140
I heard rumours around the waterfront...

337
00:40:51,225 --> 00:40:55,377
...and I figured if I got something on you,
it might be worth money to somebody.

338
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:58,902
- What rumours?
- About some kind of ore.

339
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:02,495
Now that was a good answer.
I liked that one.

340
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,904
I'm glad.

341
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:19,497
Now can you give me one good reason
why I shouldn't drop you to the pavement?

342
00:41:19,665 --> 00:41:21,621
Certainly: I'll get killed.

343
00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:25,183
Besides, I can tell you
where I get all my leads.

344
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:26,540
Where?

345
00:41:27,305 --> 00:41:29,694
Not while I'm up in this shovel, mister.

346
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,264
What were you doing
in Dominique Avignon's apartment?

347
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:35,495
A fellow in the States,
he gave me her number.

348
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:37,735
39-26-34.

349
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:42,343
The girl from the discotheque, we know
you were in her flat last night, too.

350
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:46,100
- We will have to do something about her.
- I tried. Nothing.

351
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:52,617
What do you think? Shall I?

352
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,779
Why? We can always kill him.

353
00:41:56,465 --> 00:41:58,262
Your way takes longer.

354
00:41:58,745 --> 00:42:01,942
I think we should check him out
with our contact in Washington.

355
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:04,664
There may be more to Mr. Peters
than meets the eye.

356
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:05,780
True.

357
00:42:05,865 --> 00:42:08,538
Although what meets the eye isn't bad.

358
00:42:11,105 --> 00:42:12,299
Wrap him up.

359
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:15,218
You I like.
And you, you'll come along nicely.

360
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:48,942
Crazy fraternity ring.
Phi Beta Ripper or something?

361
00:44:05,265 --> 00:44:06,823
James A. Peters.

362
00:44:07,785 --> 00:44:09,184
Postcard salesman.

363
00:44:10,345 --> 00:44:12,461
About 6'2", dark hair.

364
00:44:12,785 --> 00:44:15,618
You can reach me later at headquarters.
That's all.

365
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:22,221
We thought our troubles were over
when we got rid of Matt Helm.

366
00:44:22,705 --> 00:44:24,457
Maybe they are.

367
00:44:27,505 --> 00:44:30,542
Don't kill him until we find out who he is.

368
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:33,893
We don't want to kill a perfect stranger.

369
00:44:33,985 --> 00:44:35,782
Nobody's perfect.

370
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:42,453
Dr. Rogas, have you anything to tell me?

371
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:45,013
<i>- I'm afraid not, sir.</i>
- And what about the computers?

372
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:47,983
<i>They've tapped the preliminary formula,</i>
<i>that's all.</i>

373
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,494
<i>We still don't have the bending principle.</i>

374
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:54,863
<i>Some garbled equations are coming out,</i>
<i>but we need Solaris himself to explain them.</i>

375
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:56,822
<i>And he still won't crack.</i>

376
00:44:57,305 --> 00:45:00,934
Then make him crack. I don't care
how you do it, but make him crack.

377
00:45:01,585 --> 00:45:03,940
Now that final shipment of X4 is on its way.

378
00:45:04,025 --> 00:45:08,098
The minute it gets here, we strike!
We have got to have that beam!

379
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,978
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

380
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:21,981
No reason we can't be civilised.

381
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:24,663
I never touch the stuff.

382
00:45:26,465 --> 00:45:28,376
Are you sure you won't join me?

383
00:45:29,265 --> 00:45:32,735
- I can't stand a drink that's hot.
- We have no fridge.

384
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:35,985
I was afraid you were strictly an iceman.

385
00:45:36,105 --> 00:45:37,584
Icemen are out of business.

386
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:41,055
Nowadays they're using refrigerators
to chill everything.

387
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:43,177
There are other ways.

388
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:50,334
See?

389
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:00,061
- Cuckoo.
- Coco.

390
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:01,814
Crazy.

391
00:46:02,225 --> 00:46:03,294
Sometimes.

392
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:08,174
Bottoms up.

393
00:46:09,745 --> 00:46:11,144
I can hardly wait.

394
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:32,620
You mind turning off your head?

395
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,333
That's better.

396
00:47:42,465 --> 00:47:45,696
- I take it back. Turn it on again.
- Stop!

397
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:49,181
I ain't as fond of you as you think.

398
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:58,015
- He's awake.
<i>- Bring him up.</i>

399
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:01,744
On your feet!

400
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:09,019
You know you're beautiful
when you're angry?

401
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:21,264
There's a whole new breed
of scientists today.

402
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:23,861
They smoke, drink, swear, play around...

403
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:27,017
...but they won't answer
one simple little question.

404
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:30,017
How do you destroy Washington, D. C?

405
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:34,614
I hate you for what you're doing to him.

406
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:37,421
Your way didn't work.

407
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:41,584
You stick to your television programs,
and I'll stick to mine.

408
00:48:41,905 --> 00:48:44,373
<i>The call from Washington, sir.</i>

409
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:51,780
Good. I'll take that call in a moment.

410
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,773
Here's where we find out about Mr. Peters.

411
00:48:58,465 --> 00:48:59,818
Stand right there.

412
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:17,585
All right, put that Washington call through.

413
00:49:18,065 --> 00:49:19,657
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Go ahead.

414
00:49:19,825 --> 00:49:22,544
<i>I have the information on James A. Peters.</i>

415
00:49:23,065 --> 00:49:26,262
<i>That's not his name. It's an alias.</i>

416
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:31,539
<i>His real name is...</i>

417
00:49:31,905 --> 00:49:32,974
Repeat.

418
00:49:33,785 --> 00:49:36,822
<i>His real name is Petrone.</i>

419
00:49:37,465 --> 00:49:40,218
<i>Lash Petrone. A Chicago hood.</i>

420
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:44,258
<i>Pretty handy with a gun,</i>
<i>according to his record.</i>

421
00:49:44,345 --> 00:49:45,494
<i>Top torpedo.</i>

422
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:49,582
- What is he doing here?
<i>- He can't come back to the States.</i>

423
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:53,414
<i>If he does, his ex-wife slaps him in jail</i>
<i>for back alimony.</i>

424
00:49:55,185 --> 00:49:57,176
- Any children?
- No children.

425
00:49:57,345 --> 00:49:59,734
Two dogs: The poodle and the missus.

426
00:50:01,425 --> 00:50:04,462
Well, what about your organisation?
What is happening at I.C. E?

427
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:06,536
<i>Some kind of shake-up's in the works.</i>

428
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:09,458
<i>MacDonald is on his way over there.</i>
<i>Be careful.</i>

429
00:50:09,785 --> 00:50:11,013
Well, what for?

430
00:50:11,585 --> 00:50:14,258
I have the protection
of Chicago's top torpedo.

431
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:16,463
That's all. Thank you.

432
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:22,336
It would be rather amusing
if Mr. MacDonald were to be...

433
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:25,742
What's the expression?
Rubbed out by a fellow American.

434
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:31,454
I think you will enjoy
working in our organisation, Mr. Petrone.

435
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:33,900
- What's the pay?
- We'll discuss that another time.

436
00:50:33,985 --> 00:50:37,614
There won't be any problem.
There are so many fringe benefits.

437
00:50:42,265 --> 00:50:45,063
Do we have any photographs
of Mr. MacDonald?

438
00:50:45,145 --> 00:50:46,498
- I'll look.
- Do.

439
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,258
I would like to show them to Mr. Petrone.

440
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:51,654
You may take him back to his room now.

441
00:50:53,745 --> 00:50:54,860
No, you wait here.

442
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:59,018
I will want you to run over and check
on that discotheque a little later on.

443
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:00,823
Did I tell you?

444
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:03,341
Since you're already wanted
for one murder...

445
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:06,098
...we didn't think you'd mind
if you were wanted for another.

446
00:51:06,185 --> 00:51:09,018
That girl. What's her name?
The one you were with last night?

447
00:51:09,105 --> 00:51:11,061
- Suzie?
- Yes.

448
00:51:12,105 --> 00:51:14,255
She is rather naughty, you know.

449
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:17,539
And she seems to have
a grudge against Coco.

450
00:51:18,185 --> 00:51:22,098
And evidently she knows a bit too much
about what's going on around here.

451
00:51:22,385 --> 00:51:25,263
So you have sent her a little gift today.

452
00:51:33,545 --> 00:51:36,139
<i>- Mademoiselle</i> Susan Hamilton?
- Yes.

453
00:51:37,105 --> 00:51:38,174
For me?

454
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,061
Look at this. It's beautiful.

455
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:54,215
- From Billy?
- No.

456
00:51:54,305 --> 00:51:56,773
"Thanks for last night. Jim Peters."

457
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:58,821
Welcome to Monte Carlo.

458
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:01,703
- It wasn't what you think.
- It never is.

459
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:11,820
Cigarette.

460
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:15,098
I'd offer you one but
it's the last one I got.

461
00:52:41,465 --> 00:52:44,025
Oh, fun. The Jolly Green Giant.

462
00:52:54,385 --> 00:52:56,694
And don't ever let me do that again.

463
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:53,056
I forgot to warn you.
I'm the fastest I.C.E. In the West.

464
00:54:05,065 --> 00:54:07,101
There. You win on a foul.

465
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,774
Sorry, Frank.

466
00:58:53,385 --> 00:58:56,934
- I must vigorously protest!
- Me, too. They're trying to kill her.

467
00:58:57,025 --> 00:58:59,778
Give me the keys.
Shut up. Just give me the keys.

468
00:58:59,865 --> 00:59:02,777
We came in Suzie's car.
It's over there. The little black one.

469
00:59:02,865 --> 00:59:04,583
- Great.
- It has safety belts.

470
00:59:04,665 --> 00:59:05,984
For bullets?

471
00:59:32,505 --> 00:59:34,860
It's all right. It's the police.
We're saved.

472
00:59:34,945 --> 00:59:38,904
Saved? They think I knocked off Dominique.
I haven't got time to argue.

473
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:12,537
Attention, French Police.

474
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,583
Don't shoot. I've got an
innocent girl in the car with me.

475
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:28,934
That's the French for you.
They don't believe any girl is innocent.

476
01:01:02,185 --> 01:01:03,584
We lost them.

477
01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:07,502
Now I can sit back and enjoy the view.

478
01:01:13,705 --> 01:01:15,058
Here, put this on.

479
01:01:24,945 --> 01:01:28,301
I guess I owe you my life. Thank you.

480
01:01:29,705 --> 01:01:31,582
Thank you? That's it?

481
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:40,418
Well, all's well that ends well.

482
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:57,824
- I'm scared.
- Good thinking.

483
01:02:05,465 --> 01:02:08,104
If you can read this, you're too close.

484
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,544
Slow down!

485
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:52,660
Hold on.

486
01:03:35,665 --> 01:03:38,543
Go ahead, baby, cry it all out.

487
01:03:40,225 --> 01:03:43,456
And to think some guys
can't stand to see a girl cry.

488
01:03:44,265 --> 01:03:46,062
I got to get back on that island.

489
01:03:46,145 --> 01:03:49,854
Your father's very much alive.
And I want to keep him that way.

490
01:03:51,865 --> 01:03:52,900
Alive?

491
01:03:52,985 --> 01:03:56,739
I don't know exactly where
they're keeping him, but he was breathing.

492
01:03:58,865 --> 01:04:03,097
He's alive! Thank you. He's alive.

493
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:06,378
Yeah, he's alive. Boy, is he alive.

494
01:04:12,465 --> 01:04:15,025
You know what I want you to do for me?

495
01:04:17,465 --> 01:04:18,898
Get me a boat.

496
01:05:06,985 --> 01:05:11,263
Six, seven, eight, nine...

497
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:37,016
Now you stay on this boat and you wait.

498
01:05:37,105 --> 01:05:40,222
And if you see or hear anything
that isn't me or your father...

499
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:42,819
...you get out and get out fast,
you understand?

500
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,863
Why are you doing this?
I mean, really, why?

501
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:50,624
'Cause I'm one of America's
top secret agents...

502
01:05:50,705 --> 01:05:52,980
...and I don't want B.I.G.O.
To take over the world.

503
01:05:53,065 --> 01:05:54,657
Come on, I'm serious.

504
01:05:54,745 --> 01:05:56,417
You ask a silly question...

505
01:06:11,025 --> 01:06:13,619
Just remember, Suzie,
nobody dies for nothing.

506
01:06:13,705 --> 01:06:15,980
Not me, not your father, nobody.

507
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:17,414
Be careful.

508
01:06:18,465 --> 01:06:20,456
You can do better than that.

509
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:25,821
<i>Yes, Mr. Wall,</i>
<i>the entire shipment has been delivered.</i>

510
01:07:26,265 --> 01:07:29,496
<i>- It is already being energised.</i>
- Good.

511
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:36,302
This is Julian Wall...

512
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:41,583
...advising you that the final shipment
of X4 has arrived exactly on schedule.

513
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:43,417
It is being processed.

514
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:46,773
I promise you that within the hour...

515
01:07:46,865 --> 01:07:49,379
...the capital of the United States will be...

516
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:51,223
...destroyed.

517
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,578
I will keep in close touch with all of you.

518
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:07,778
Well, Rogas?

519
01:08:09,905 --> 01:08:12,624
<i>- Solaris has begun to talk.</i>
- Good.

520
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:14,502
<i>We've learned how to curve the beams...</i>

521
01:08:14,585 --> 01:08:17,383
<i>...but we still don't know</i>
<i>what triggers the joining mechanism.</i>

522
01:08:17,465 --> 01:08:19,933
- What do you mean?
<i>- There's one equation missing.</i>

523
01:08:20,025 --> 01:08:22,698
<i>- He won't budge.</i>
- Well, make him.

524
01:08:22,785 --> 01:08:26,095
<i>- He's very weak.</i>
- Make him!

525
01:08:26,865 --> 01:08:29,333
Make him! I give you one hour.

526
01:08:30,105 --> 01:08:31,777
One hour, Dr. Rogas!

527
01:08:45,265 --> 01:08:47,256
- Halt!
- Certainly.

528
01:08:57,545 --> 01:08:59,934
Well, if it isn't Frosty the Snowman.

529
01:09:00,465 --> 01:09:02,740
No, you may not leave the room.

530
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:07,022
What are you, a traffic cop?

531
01:09:23,465 --> 01:09:25,421
The pigeons are gonna love you.

532
01:09:42,105 --> 01:09:44,903
I'm terribly sorry, I seem to be lost.

533
01:09:45,865 --> 01:09:49,016
Mr. Wall sent me to interview the prisoner.

534
01:09:49,145 --> 01:09:51,864
And I just can't seem to find my way.

535
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,581
Thank you so much.

536
01:10:18,585 --> 01:10:20,018
Thank you.

537
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:29,298
Much obliged.

538
01:11:10,465 --> 01:11:11,659
Six...

539
01:11:12,385 --> 01:11:15,422
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

540
01:11:40,065 --> 01:11:43,694
You did a fine job, pal, but I'm afraid
this is the only thing that'll get...

541
01:11:43,785 --> 01:11:45,423
...both of us out of here.

542
01:11:47,145 --> 01:11:48,260
Daddy.

543
01:11:50,865 --> 01:11:53,743
What are you doing?
You're trying to kill him.

544
01:11:56,025 --> 01:11:57,902
Penny for your thoughts.

545
01:12:05,665 --> 01:12:08,133
Daddy, are you all right?

546
01:12:08,705 --> 01:12:10,616
Well...

547
01:12:11,545 --> 01:12:13,422
...he has a daughter.

548
01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:18,418
We have been working on the wrong Solaris.
Bring them up.

549
01:12:28,305 --> 01:12:30,865
Instead of being pushed around,
I ought to get a medal.

550
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:32,014
- A medal?
- Yeah.

551
01:12:32,105 --> 01:12:35,097
I knew she was Solaris' daughter.
That's why I saved her life...

552
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:36,379
...and brought her here.

553
01:12:36,465 --> 01:12:39,457
I figured she was more valuable to you alive.

554
01:12:39,545 --> 01:12:42,901
Very good.
I don't believe you, but very good.

555
01:12:44,145 --> 01:12:45,419
Dr. Solaris...

556
01:12:46,105 --> 01:12:49,222
...there seems to be a missing equation.
Now may we have it?

557
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,221
- No.
- Come now, Doctor.

558
01:12:53,185 --> 01:12:56,575
Men of goodwill have done a perfectly
dreadful job of running the world.

559
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:58,621
Perhaps it's time for a change.

560
01:12:58,785 --> 01:12:59,820
Admit it.

561
01:12:59,905 --> 01:13:03,818
- I can't do much worse.
- I think you can. I have faith in you.

562
01:13:05,265 --> 01:13:08,462
<i>Mr. Wall,</i>
<i>an urgent call from our Washington man.</i>

563
01:13:16,665 --> 01:13:18,496
- Yes?
<i>- We're here in Monte Carlo...</i>

564
01:13:18,585 --> 01:13:21,622
<i>...MacDonald, the whole group.</i>
<i>I think he's on to something.</i>

565
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:23,457
- Kill him.
<i>- What?</i>

566
01:13:23,545 --> 01:13:27,015
Kill them all.
Set up your apparatus and destroy I.C.E.

567
01:13:27,105 --> 01:13:30,302
<i>I had no chance to bring the apparatus.</i>
<i>There was no time.</i>

568
01:13:30,585 --> 01:13:34,214
I don't care how you do it.
I want MacDonald dead now.

569
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:39,302
- MacDonald.
- Why don't you let me handle him?

570
01:13:39,385 --> 01:13:42,821
I would, but I just don't think
you're going to live that long.

571
01:13:45,105 --> 01:13:46,458
Dr. Solaris.

572
01:13:56,025 --> 01:14:00,064
She certainly has good taste.
She picked my chicest outfit.

573
01:14:01,785 --> 01:14:02,854
Well!

574
01:14:04,505 --> 01:14:06,655
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

575
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:10,264
I believe just a dash of red.

576
01:14:12,065 --> 01:14:13,100
Yes?

577
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:30,456
Watch the dress.

578
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:46,777
Well, Dr. Solaris...

579
01:14:47,545 --> 01:14:51,094
...in a little while,
Washington traffic will be at its height.

580
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:54,097
Operation Scorch
will kill a great many people.

581
01:14:54,945 --> 01:14:56,776
We call it Operation Scorch.

582
01:14:57,225 --> 01:14:58,374
Catchy title.

583
01:14:59,065 --> 01:15:00,942
It's up to you, Doctor.

584
01:15:01,025 --> 01:15:02,697
My colleagues are waiting.

585
01:15:04,745 --> 01:15:06,098
Where do we begin?

586
01:15:15,305 --> 01:15:16,897
You talked me into it.

587
01:15:16,985 --> 01:15:20,341
You get MacDonald
on one of those things and I'll talk to him.

588
01:15:21,545 --> 01:15:24,059
We'll play a little game, "What's My Line?"

589
01:15:24,225 --> 01:15:25,578
May I?

590
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:30,138
I deal in services
and I'm bigger than a breadbox.

591
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:32,943
Now who am I?

592
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:40,138
He's Matt Helm.

593
01:15:41,385 --> 01:15:43,057
We got a winner.

594
01:15:43,345 --> 01:15:45,905
- You are dead.
- I'm beginning to believe it.

595
01:15:45,985 --> 01:15:48,055
I'll tell you what,
I'll make a deal with you.

596
01:15:48,145 --> 01:15:50,340
You call off the heat,
I'll call off the I.C.E.

597
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:52,700
I'll tell MacDonald you were wiped out.

598
01:15:52,785 --> 01:15:55,504
They'll go on home.
That'll give you and me more time.

599
01:15:55,585 --> 01:15:56,620
Crazy?

600
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,179
Traitor.

601
01:15:58,625 --> 01:15:59,978
No doubt about it.

602
01:16:00,345 --> 01:16:01,619
I like it.

603
01:16:06,865 --> 01:16:09,743
A call just came in on our
special frequency. Get it back.

604
01:16:09,825 --> 01:16:12,897
And monitor the call.
If they try to trace us, jam them.

605
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:16,296
Would you fill this up?
I always like to take a straight bourbon...

606
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:18,535
...before I talk to Mac, 'cause he...

607
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:20,581
...wouldn't recognise me if I was sober.

608
01:16:29,825 --> 01:16:31,736
<i>We're ready with the call, sir.</i>

609
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,854
One wrong word, wrong inflection...

610
01:16:39,505 --> 01:16:40,574
Thank you.

611
01:16:40,905 --> 01:16:43,578
Mac, it's Matt. I got news.

612
01:16:44,065 --> 01:16:45,942
Matt, are you all right?

613
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:47,853
<i>Couldn't be better.</i>

614
01:16:47,945 --> 01:16:50,857
As a matter of fact, I'm standing here
having a nice little...

615
01:16:50,945 --> 01:16:53,505
- ...glass of bourbon.
<i>- What's news about that?</i>

616
01:16:53,585 --> 01:16:57,100
Celebrating.
I just thought you'd like to know that...

617
01:16:58,065 --> 01:16:59,976
...well, mission accomplished.

618
01:17:00,065 --> 01:17:03,535
Solaris alive, and happy ending USA.

619
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:07,177
Great, Matt. Great.
Fill me in. How was it? Pretty rough?

620
01:17:07,265 --> 01:17:10,382
Well, you know, it was warm for a while.

621
01:17:10,465 --> 01:17:12,854
What's a little heat among friends?

622
01:17:12,945 --> 01:17:15,300
- I'll tell you all about it.
- Okay, Matt.

623
01:17:15,385 --> 01:17:19,822
Good boy. You wind up things at your end.
I'll meet you at the new headquarters.

624
01:17:19,905 --> 01:17:23,056
- I'll see you back in Washington.
- Right, bye.

625
01:17:23,825 --> 01:17:26,976
- Congratulations, Chief.
- Save it.

626
01:17:27,065 --> 01:17:29,977
Matt Helm never took
a drink of bourbon in his life.

627
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:33,422
And the new headquarters
are at Baltimore, not Washington.

628
01:17:33,905 --> 01:17:37,102
He must have said Washington
because that must be the hit.

629
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:40,257
Give the order
to evacuate Washington. Now.

630
01:17:40,985 --> 01:17:43,624
Hold it. Hold everything, just a second.

631
01:17:45,225 --> 01:17:47,500
One other thing. Matt also said:

632
01:17:47,585 --> 01:17:50,258
"What's a little heat among friends?"

633
01:17:54,865 --> 01:17:57,459
Heat among friends.

634
01:17:58,385 --> 01:18:00,262
Padgett, Levinson.

635
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,781
Butler, Furnas, Whitmo.

636
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:10,693
Furnas.

637
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:29,897
Well done, Mr. Helm.

638
01:18:30,545 --> 01:18:34,094
There may be a place
in our organisation for you after all.

639
01:18:40,865 --> 01:18:42,935
<i>Mr. Wall. Urgent.</i>

640
01:18:44,745 --> 01:18:45,894
Yes.

641
01:18:45,985 --> 01:18:50,024
<i>I monitored the call as you ordered.</i>
<i>Something came in after you finished.</i>

642
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:52,141
<i>- From Furnas.</i>
- Well?

643
01:18:52,225 --> 01:18:53,624
<i>I could barely hear him.</i>

644
01:18:53,705 --> 01:18:57,744
<i>He said: "Matt Helm's call was a trick.</i>
<i>Some kind of code.</i>

645
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:00,262
<i>"MacDonald knows."</i>

646
01:19:00,345 --> 01:19:04,020
<i>He also said:</i>
<i>"We won't be hearing from him anymore."</i>

647
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:23,818
Take him.

648
01:19:36,785 --> 01:19:38,457
MacDonald knows, does he?

649
01:19:39,865 --> 01:19:41,776
Well, he's too late.

650
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:44,217
Dr. Solaris...

651
01:19:44,465 --> 01:19:47,980
...are you going to tell us
how to operate your invention...

652
01:19:48,065 --> 01:19:51,341
...or would you rather see
your daughter tortured to death?

653
01:19:57,505 --> 01:19:59,336
The next one will be closer.

654
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:12,775
No, it doesn't go with the outfit.

655
01:20:17,545 --> 01:20:18,978
What a way to finish.

656
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:22,694
For a guy that drank booze all his life
to end up like a milkshake.

657
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:44,458
Stay.

658
01:20:47,025 --> 01:20:49,141
I have one spear left, Doctor.

659
01:20:52,905 --> 01:20:56,056
Don't tell him. Don't
look and don't tell him.

660
01:21:05,905 --> 01:21:07,099
Wait.

661
01:21:30,705 --> 01:21:31,854
It's all set.

662
01:21:33,585 --> 01:21:34,654
Let her go.

663
01:21:44,825 --> 01:21:48,374
She will be our guest for a while.
Take her to the guest quarters.

664
01:22:04,825 --> 01:22:06,304
I'm waiting.

665
01:22:13,065 --> 01:22:15,056
The beams are on their way.

666
01:22:31,505 --> 01:22:32,938
Wait a minute.

667
01:22:36,425 --> 01:22:37,824
I want to watch this.

668
01:22:37,905 --> 01:22:39,941
I want to see him get what's coming to him.

669
01:22:40,025 --> 01:22:43,938
- Well, I don't know. We better...
- Please. He tried to kill my father.

670
01:22:44,985 --> 01:22:46,054
Okay.

671
01:22:58,425 --> 01:23:00,097
It's remarkable equipment.

672
01:23:01,105 --> 01:23:03,380
Dr. Rogas invented it. I'm his nephew.

673
01:23:04,185 --> 01:23:05,379
Please.

674
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:11,662
When the selenium rectifier retracts,
the oscillation increases.

675
01:23:11,745 --> 01:23:12,860
You don't say.

676
01:23:12,945 --> 01:23:16,096
It breaks down the rheostatic vibro-voltage
to a minimal. 360...

677
01:23:16,185 --> 01:23:18,176
- ...on the oscilloscope.
- Cute.

678
01:23:19,225 --> 01:23:20,977
Magnesium transformer.

679
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:24,697
Multivator circuit, inverted radium shield.

680
01:23:24,785 --> 01:23:28,903
All absolutely impregnable
against dust, heat, cold...

681
01:23:28,985 --> 01:23:32,500
- ...rust, erosion. Bulletproof, too.
- Wow.

682
01:23:58,785 --> 01:24:02,061
<i>Attention all power units, this is Dr. Rogas.</i>

683
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,139
<i>There has been a failure</i>
<i>in the multivator circuit.</i>

684
01:24:05,225 --> 01:24:08,183
<i>Man your respective stations</i>
<i>for an immediate check...</i>

685
01:24:08,265 --> 01:24:11,302
<i>...of the entire V.T.V.M. System.</i>

686
01:24:12,185 --> 01:24:15,860
<i>The selenium rectifier, the C.R.T...</i>

687
01:24:15,945 --> 01:24:19,984
<i>...the multivator frequency,</i>
<i>the energised oscilloscope. I repeat.</i>

688
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:22,415
<i>The selenium rectifier.</i>

689
01:24:22,505 --> 01:24:24,496
You. Cover the door.

690
01:24:25,505 --> 01:24:27,223
I'll finish the job myself.

691
01:24:54,265 --> 01:24:55,414
Hey.

692
01:24:57,225 --> 01:25:00,376
- Knock it off.
- That's what I say, Charley, knock it off.

693
01:25:53,785 --> 01:25:55,776
Maybe it's this one? Or this...

694
01:25:55,865 --> 01:25:58,698
- No, don't touch that. That's the magnet.
- What?

695
01:25:58,785 --> 01:26:00,343
The magnet.

696
01:26:02,025 --> 01:26:05,097
- Well, I was only trying to help.
- But don't touch that.

697
01:27:15,345 --> 01:27:17,495
Matt! Behind you.

698
01:28:19,265 --> 01:28:21,062
The boat! I'll get the boat!

699
01:28:39,065 --> 01:28:42,057
- And now if you'll excuse me, Doctor.
- No.

700
01:28:43,465 --> 01:28:45,183
You are right.

701
01:29:34,145 --> 01:29:35,294
I give up.

702
01:29:36,465 --> 01:29:38,137
I can't go on.

703
01:29:45,785 --> 01:29:48,219
Seven, eight, nine...

704
01:30:12,785 --> 01:30:14,264
- Where's Wall?
- It's no use.

705
01:30:14,345 --> 01:30:17,735
He's controlling the beam
from the hovercraft, out there.

706
01:32:53,825 --> 01:32:55,702
They're right behind us, sir.

707
01:33:28,705 --> 01:33:31,299
- Well, shoot back.
- With what?

708
01:33:37,585 --> 01:33:38,813
Good shot.

709
01:33:53,705 --> 01:33:56,856
If he aims like that at Washington,
he'll hit Pittsburgh.

710
01:34:29,705 --> 01:34:31,024
He's yawing!

711
01:34:31,705 --> 01:34:33,696
I don't feel so good myself.

712
01:35:53,985 --> 01:35:55,737
Mr. Matt Helm.

713
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:59,378
Our Operation Scorch is on its way.

714
01:35:59,465 --> 01:36:01,854
No, nothing can stop it now.

715
01:36:03,825 --> 01:36:06,737
Go ahead and shoot.
I have failed, just shoot.

716
01:36:08,345 --> 01:36:09,903
If you say so.

717
01:36:47,545 --> 01:36:49,581
- Clever.
- If you say so.

718
01:36:56,385 --> 01:36:57,420
Excuse me.

719
01:37:05,225 --> 01:37:06,943
Who's ahead?

720
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:09,263
The game is over.

721
01:37:57,345 --> 01:37:59,176
There they are.

722
01:37:59,265 --> 01:38:02,302
Naturally. I majored in navigation
while I was at Yale.

723
01:38:03,825 --> 01:38:05,258
It's Billy!

724
01:38:06,705 --> 01:38:10,061
A boat and a helicopter.
I'm sending all my kids to Yale.

725
01:38:47,345 --> 01:38:49,142
Polka dot shorts!

726
01:38:49,785 --> 01:38:51,582
The only way to fly.

727
01:39:03,345 --> 01:39:07,577
- It was a marvellous welcome home party.
- Yeah, and the party hasn't even started.

728
01:39:07,665 --> 01:39:10,099
- Oh, yeah?
- I like being back in America.

729
01:39:10,225 --> 01:39:14,377
I love it. I love every nook and cranny.

730
01:39:14,465 --> 01:39:16,615
Every hill and dale.

731
01:39:16,705 --> 01:39:19,981
Easy, I get a little ticklish
west of the Mississippi.

732
01:39:22,705 --> 01:39:25,742
One thing I really do miss, though,
about Monte Carlo...

733
01:39:25,825 --> 01:39:29,704
...being able to take a plunge in the water,
any time, day or night.

734
01:39:54,985 --> 01:39:56,782
Welcome to the Riviera.

735
01:40:10,985 --> 01:40:13,215
It's an ambush. Let's get out of here.
