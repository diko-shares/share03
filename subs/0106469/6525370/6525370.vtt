00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:51.053
So what's the difference
between East L.A. And L.A.?

2
00:01:51.126 --> 00:01:53.060
It's a whole
different country.

3
00:01:53.128 --> 00:01:55.722
Hope it works out better
for you here than in Vegas.

4
00:01:55.797 --> 00:01:57.731
It's got to.
It's home.

5
00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.678
<i> You're not gonna get anything
like this in Las Vegas.</i>

6
00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:13.681
<i>You got that right. I been
dreamin'about these for 18 months.</i>

7
00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.583
<i>- No, mi hijo. Como siempre.
- Gracias. Eighteen months.</i>

8
00:02:17.653 --> 00:02:20.588
Say hello to your mother.
And stay outta trouble!

<i>Hey, hey!
Ç Cuidado, mi hijo!</i>

11
00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:57.789
<i>Jesse! I'm gonna need
a trim, homes. ¿Cuando?</i>

12
00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.054
<i>- Manana a las once.

13
00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:36.191
<i> Miklo, tell those wetbacks
to step on it, or they ain't gonna get paid.</i>

14
00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:38.892
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you!

15
00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:40.958
Get their asses movin'.
I got two more trucks on the way.

16
00:03:41.036 --> 00:03:43.163
I'm already humpin'
and you ordered too much.

17
00:03:43.238 --> 00:03:46.503
<i>That's 1,500 bucks of mud. Tell them to
get it down, or they can pay for it.</i>

18
00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:48.873
Your mistake.
Tell 'em yourself.

19
00:03:48.944 --> 00:03:51.242
Don't ever take the side of the Mexican
over your father! Just tell 'em!

20
00:03:51.313 --> 00:03:54.111
<i>- Fuck you!
- You ungrateful little punk!</i>

21
00:03:54.182 --> 00:03:56.082
<i>I'm the one that
kept you out ofjail!</i>

22
00:03:56.151 --> 00:03:58.483
You love 'em so much, you can get
the same thing they're gettin' paid.

23
00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:01.681
<i>- I'll get a man to run this group.
- You son-of-a-bitch!</i>

24
00:04:01.757 --> 00:04:04.157
<i>
Find yourself another slave, Dad!</i>

25
00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:06.251
<i>- You're through!
- I'm goin'home!</i>

26
00:04:06.328 --> 00:04:09.627
<i>You're fired! I'm telling
your probation officer!</i>

27
00:04:09.698 --> 00:04:13.099
I wish I could have
seen your father's face.

28
00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:20.000
You beat him up.

29
00:04:20.075 --> 00:04:22.339
<i>Ay, Dios mio.</i>

30
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:26.177
<i>Ay, Miklo, he'll kill me
if he finds you here!</i>

31
00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:28.648
Don't worry, Mama. He ain't never
gonna touch you again.

32
00:04:28.717 --> 00:04:31.982
<i>- Not after what I done.
- I know that cabron. He'll turn you in.</i>

33
00:04:33.622 --> 00:04:35.613
Miklo, come.
Help do me up.

34
00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:40.786
You know, if the judge finds out
you're here, he's gonna stop my check.

35
00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:43.990
I need that money.
Whoo, baby, cold hands!

36
00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:49.469
<i>Oye, mami. En seis días, just six
little days, bingo, I'm home free.</i>

37
00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:53.872
<i>Ay, bingo. What's this bingo? What
are you gonna be doing in six days?</i>

38
00:04:53.942 --> 00:04:57.207
<i>Mi cumpleanos.

39
00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:01.147
My birthday, remember?
I'll be off probation.

40
00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:04.049
A birthday.
Ooh, eighteen.

41
00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:06.053
<i>Que macho.

42
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:08.089
<i>Mami, mami, mami.</i>

43
00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:11.717
<i>But to me you're always gonna be

<i>Oye, I'm late.
Beto hates to wait.</i>

46
00:05:17.332 --> 00:05:20.267
Hey, Miklo. You can stay with
your Aunt Dolores, huh?

47
00:05:20.335 --> 00:05:22.394

- How long are you here?
- Uh, I'm back for good.

57
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:07.810

<i>Look, um,
I gotta go.</i>

59
00:06:10.352 --> 00:06:12.616
Dolores, Miklo's gonna stay
with you for a while, okay?

60
00:06:12.687 --> 00:06:15.349
- Why?
- Because you have so much more room.

61
00:06:15.423 --> 00:06:17.755
<i>-
- I love you, nino, huh?</i>

62
00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:23.861
Lupe, you may be my sister, but I'm
tired of taking care of you. Grow up!

63
00:06:23.932 --> 00:06:26.560
<i> Look, I have tried to
be like you. I can't.</i>

64
00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:28.762
<i>- Your life would drive me crazy!
- Ooh, orale.</i>

65
00:06:28.837 --> 00:06:32.466

- Back for good, homes.

00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:34.839
<i>- ¿Que tal?
- What's happening, man?</i>

67
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.935
Thought you was never
coming back, eh.

68
00:06:37.012 --> 00:06:39.446
Hey, you know me. I always find my way
back to East Los, homes.

69
00:06:39.514 --> 00:06:41.573
You couldn't hang with your
white boy daddy or what?

70
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.610
Paco, Miklo's gonna be staying with us
for a while, huh? Make room for him.

71
00:06:48.223 --> 00:06:50.214
Ain't no one share my bed
and TV but a woman.

72
00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:54.524
<i>- This puto's staying in the garage, eh.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

73
00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.533
You're not the rooster here,
huh? This is my house.

74
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.734
Miklo's your cousin.

75
00:07:10.245 --> 00:07:15.239
Take this electric bill over to Mano and
tell him it has to be paid this afternoon.

77

<i>Hey, check out this
fucking "3 P", ese.</i>

Since when do we let Tres Puntos
get away with that shit, homes?

81

Big badass vato.
3 P ain't nothin'...

<i>- They ain't about shit, ese.
- They are shit, ese.</i>

84
00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:42.969
Why the fuck do you come
all the way back here?

85
00:07:43.044 --> 00:07:47.140
'Cause you owe me five bucks, ese,
and I came back to collect with this!

I talked to the recruiter, Bentley.
He's waiting for you.

And take orders from
a jarhead like you?

<i> You may be my stepfather,

Hey, take it easy on Mano, homes.
He just wants you to work.

Hey, he's your dad, not mine.
Let him tell you what to do, eh.

Elephant farts.

<i>- You still have your quills and inks?
- Simon. ¿Por que?</i>

160
00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:51.641
Get down, James Brown.
Put the needle in, huh?

00:11:51.709 --> 00:11:53.870
<i> I want
my V.L. Tattoo.</i>

<i>Hey, take a look

163
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.480
<i> Does it snow in L.A.?</i>

164
00:11:58.549 --> 00:12:00.744
<i>Does a white boy get
a V.L. placazo?</i>

165
00:12:00.818 --> 00:12:02.945
No, he don't!

166
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.750
<i>I'd have my placa now if the judge
hadn't thrown me outta East Los.</i>

It's some serious shit, homes.
It don't wash off.

169
00:12:10.094 --> 00:12:13.063
First sign of trouble, you'll be running
back to your white boy daddy in Las Vegas.

170
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.564
<i>Oye, vato, dejalo.

...Folsom and Indiana,

Hello, officer.

177
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:39.514
What seems to be
the problem, sir?

178
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:43.391
Bumper clearance has gotta
be at least ten inches.

179
00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:45.759
- Oh, really?
- You, in the car.

<i>Registration,

00:12:56.841 --> 00:12:59.105
Take off the glasses,

183

You look familiar.

<i>You got a record?</i>

185
00:13:10.187 --> 00:13:13.247
Yes, sir, he's got a record.
He's got a great record.

186
00:13:13.324 --> 00:13:15.690
"The Black Rooster."
Thirteen K.O.'s.

187
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.323
He's got a great
right uppercut.

188
00:13:21.398 --> 00:13:25.459
You, uh, used to train at
the Boys' Club, didn't you?

189
00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:28.801
Two years, second division Golden
Gloves, 'til, 'til he broke his wrist.

190
00:13:28.873 --> 00:13:32.001
<i>- Oh, yeah, I remember.

192
00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:46.721
It looks nice.

193
00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:52.195
Listen, uh, just raise up
the bumper a few inches, okay?

194
00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:54.697
Like your
uppercut, huh?

195
00:13:54.765 --> 00:13:58.428
Thank you, officer. We will, sir.

196
00:13:58.502 --> 00:14:01.801
Ah, it's all right, Joe. Let's go.
Hey, you know who the kid was?

197
00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:05.740
<i>Pinche culero. Didn't have that fuckin' badge

200
00:14:11.448 --> 00:14:13.473
I let you put my hat
off my head once,

201
00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:17.214

my business before I put you down, milkweed.

<i>Ya. Ya, vato. Come on,

You know it.

204
00:14:25.696 --> 00:14:30.133
<i>-  Hungry, Miklo?
-  I got the munchies, man.</i>

205

<i>- We get back to the canton, we'll get some refino.

So, Cruz, here's your plaque.
Your award of honor.

259
00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:28.410
And much more important
than this plaque, however,

260
00:17:28.479 --> 00:17:31.448
I want to give you this,
which is your scholarship...

261
00:17:31.515 --> 00:17:33.779
from the Los Angeles
College of Design.

262

I, uh...

266
00:17:50.501 --> 00:17:54.096
I first started painting
when I used to draw...

267
00:17:54.171 --> 00:17:58.938
little cards for my mom
when she was sick in the hospital.

268
00:17:59.009 --> 00:18:01.739
Those little cards
made her happy,

269
00:18:01.812 --> 00:18:06.340
<i>and she told me then,
"Mijo, tu eres un artista."</i>

270
00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:08.647
You are an artist.

271
00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:10.949
I guess she was right.

272
00:18:11.021 --> 00:18:14.149
I just wish that she
was here to see it.

273
00:18:14.225 --> 00:18:18.161
<i>I want to thank especial mi...

or bail somebody out!

Hey, Frankie, let me borrow

00:22:30.847 --> 00:22:34.476
- Huh? Guess what? I got Frankie's brother's GT.
- Oh, you did?

345
00:22:34.551 --> 00:22:37.019
<i>Yeah, you know it,
mi hija.</i>

346
00:22:37.087 --> 00:22:39.419
So what's up? I thought you was
gonna be at this thing...

347
00:22:39.489 --> 00:22:41.616

<i>Oh, well,

<i>*I'll never, never
never have no peace</i>

354
00:23:03.613 --> 00:23:06.207
<i>- Let's get outta here.
- No, no, no, no, no</i>

355
00:23:06.283 --> 00:23:09.844
- Hey, where's Cruz going? Hey, come here, homes!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

356
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.911
No, wait, homes.
Where you goin'?

00:23:11.988 --> 00:23:14.422
<i>- Cruz's gonna open a present now, eh.

- Oooh! - Oooh! -
You gotta finish him!

363
00:23:25.602 --> 00:23:28.002
But Bobby Chacon rises and dusts
Chucho Castillo.

364
00:23:28.071 --> 00:23:30.335
Pa-pa-pa pow-pow.
Picks him up...

<i>Tus labios,

Ooh.

<i>Te voy a pintar, m'hija.</i>

372
00:23:53.729 --> 00:23:57.221
I'm gonna paint you

00:24:03.272 --> 00:24:06.298
<i>Tocame, suavecito.</i>

374

375
00:24:13.683 --> 00:24:17.175
<i>- Hold me - I want
you... - </i>

376
00:24:17.253 --> 00:24:20.051
Ooh, looky, looky.
Can I have some?

00:24:20.122 --> 00:24:22.682
<i>- I like mine rare.

00:24:22.758 --> 00:24:25.056
Ye-pa, ye-pa, ye-pa!

00:24:25.127 --> 00:24:27.118
What door
do I pick?

380
00:24:27.196 --> 00:24:29.892
<i>Chingalos, putos.
This ain't your turf, ese!</i>

381
00:24:29.966 --> 00:24:32.264
<i>Get him out!
Get him out, guero!</i>

00:24:32.335 --> 00:24:34.030
<i>Ç Dejalo! Ç No!</i>

00:24:54.724 --> 00:25:00.128
<i>We gotta teach these putos a lesson!

<i>
Ç Ay! My back, my back!</i>

392
00:25:26.756 --> 00:25:29.156
<i> He's still under
the anesthetic. I gotta go back in.</i>

393
00:25:29.225 --> 00:25:33.184
Your son has multiple contusions. The
thoracic vertebrae in his back is broken.

394
00:25:33.262 --> 00:25:36.493
<i>- It's very serious.
- When will we know if he'll be okay?</i>

395
00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:39.864
His spleen is injured, so I gotta
go back in and stop the bleeding.

396
00:25:39.935 --> 00:25:43.564
<i>If he gets an abdominal infection,
he might be in for a prolonged stay.</i>

397
00:25:43.639 --> 00:25:46.267
I'm sorry. That's all
I gotta say right now.

398
00:25:50.446 --> 00:25:52.846
<i>- ¿Que paso?
- We got the vatos here.</i>

00:25:52.915 --> 00:25:54.542
<i>Vamonos.</i>

00:25:54.617 --> 00:25:57.848
<i>- Orale, vatos, that rocho...

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.289

00:26:02.358 --> 00:26:03.848
<i>- Big time!

Shut up! We ain't gonna
be hitting 'em tonight, eh.

404
00:26:06.595 --> 00:26:09.120
They're gonna be waiting for us tonight.
We're gonna get 'em tomorrow morning.

405
00:26:09.198 --> 00:26:11.132
In the daylight?
It's Sunday, ese.

406
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.033
<i>They ain't gonna be going
to Mass, pendejo.</i>

407
00:26:14.103 --> 00:26:17.504
Gimme that! You don't think I want
'em, eh? You don't think I want 'em?

408
00:26:17.573 --> 00:26:20.098
I got some poison for a spider,
eh, but for tomorrow.

409
00:26:20.176 --> 00:26:22.610
<i>-
- Paco! Paco!</i>

410
00:26:22.678 --> 00:26:25.146
<i>Hey, hey,
cool it, ese!</i>

411
00:26:25.214 --> 00:26:27.944
<i>- What are you doing?
-  We can't let those punks come into our barrio...</i>

412
00:26:28.017 --> 00:26:30.451
- Get out, all of you! Just get out of here!
- Start pushing us around.

413
00:26:30.519 --> 00:26:32.851
- Who are you fighting?
- Tres Puntos!

414
00:26:32.922 --> 00:26:36.517
<i>- Chuey, who are you fighting, pendejos? Yourselves!
- What are you doing?</i>

415
00:26:36.592 --> 00:26:38.856
<i>- Don't talk to him like that.
- Just fighting yourselves!</i>

416
00:26:38.928 --> 00:26:41.761
<i>- Those are mi carnales. They're my family.
- I'm your family!</i>

417
00:26:41.831 --> 00:26:44.629
We should be taking care of each other,
not fighting on the street!

418
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.759
Hey, we do nothing
and we are nothing!

419
00:26:46.836 --> 00:26:50.067
<i>- Fuck that! Come on!
- Yeah, homes, chale!</i>

420
00:26:50.139 --> 00:26:54.337
<i>- Paco! Paco, mi hijo!
- </i>

421
00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.971
- No, Miklo.
- I'm sorry, Tia.

422
00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:06.656
<i>Ooh!
I like the country, ese!</i>

423
00:27:06.722 --> 00:27:10.351
Hey, Kool-Aid, put that little jalapeno
back in your pants, ese.

424
00:27:10.426 --> 00:27:12.656
- Hey, homey,

425
00:27:12.728 --> 00:27:15.288
I was just marking
our new territory!

426
00:27:15.364 --> 00:27:18.663
<i> That's right. We're the new
landlords. Vato Locos are finished.</i>

427
00:27:18.734 --> 00:27:21.464
Check out

428
00:27:21.537 --> 00:27:24.267
I'm gonna build myself
a righteous pad here.

429
00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.865
Swimming pool, white
picket fence and shit.

430
00:27:26.943 --> 00:27:33.143
<i>Hey, Joker, you got
a fine mamacita, homes! Mwa!</i>

<i>- Save me some.

<i>- It's that punk from the alley.
- Hey, Spider!</i>

441
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.790
Vato loco must be on
medication to come here.

00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:20.192
<i>You cut my carnal!

You should not have done that

00:55:26.254 --> 00:55:29.815
Chicanos killing Chicanos
is what they want.

796
00:55:29.891 --> 00:55:33.884
Blacks and Chicanos killing
each other is what they want.

797
00:55:33.962 --> 00:55:36.522
<i>That's how they
run this place.</i>

798
00:55:36.598 --> 00:55:39.226
Once we get together,
they don't run shit.

799
00:55:40.835 --> 00:55:43.736
<i>You got a lot to learn
about being Chicano, guero.</i>

800
00:55:43.805 --> 00:55:47.104
I'm no lightweight, and the color
of my skin shouldn't keep me out.

801
00:55:47.175 --> 00:55:49.439
White is the enemy.

802
00:55:49.511 --> 00:55:51.741
White's the system.

803
00:55:51.813 --> 00:55:54.281
You're stuck
in the middle.

804
00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.612
All my fuckin' life
I've been kept out.

805
00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:03.590
You know what that
feels like?

806
00:56:03.658 --> 00:56:08.288
Knowing you're a Chicano and no one
accepts you 'cause your skin came out white?

807
00:56:08.363 --> 00:56:10.331
<i>My mom's as brown
as you are,</i>

808
00:56:10.398 --> 00:56:15.028
and my white dad tried to beat
every ounce of her outta me.

809
00:56:15.103 --> 00:56:18.368
But you know what?
He couldn't do it.

810
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:22.536
Chicano's not a color. It's the way
you think and the way you live.

811
00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:25.670
<i>And if you're willing to give
your life up for a carnal.</i>

812
00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:32.809
I'm here to do that.
Use me. Use this.

813
00:56:35.156 --> 00:56:37.124
<i>¿Como?</i>

814
00:56:37.192 --> 00:56:40.992
You said it. Everything's
based on color, right?

815
00:56:41.062 --> 00:56:44.623
I can get places you can't
'cause my skin's white on the outside.

816
00:56:45.834 --> 00:56:49.565
But I'm brown on the inside.
To the bones.

817
00:56:51.873 --> 00:56:56.003
The only way into La Onda is
to take down one of our enemies.

818
00:56:56.077 --> 00:56:58.204
In your case, it would
have to be somebody big.

819
00:56:58.279 --> 00:57:02.648
<i>Someone we can't hit without
losing a lot of carnales.</i>

820
00:57:02.717 --> 00:57:06.050
<i>- Chale.
- Gimme a chance!</i>

821
00:57:06.121 --> 00:57:08.885
Trust me.
Just one chance!

822
00:57:08.957 --> 00:57:11.050
<i>Estoy listo.</i>

823
00:57:13.828 --> 00:57:18.322
<i>Respect is everything, guero.
You ready to die for it?</i>

824
00:57:19.868 --> 00:57:21.802
<i>Vamos a ver.</i>

825
00:57:23.037 --> 00:57:25.028
Blood in, blood out.

826
00:57:32.147 --> 00:57:36.243
<i>- Entiendes?
- Todo.</i>

827
00:57:40.538 --> 00:57:42.802
<i> We start cookin'
breakfast at 4:30 a.m.</i>

828
00:57:42.873 --> 00:57:45.842
Start dinner at 2:00. I'm startin' you
on pots and pans, with the niggers.

829
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:49.471
Thanks for nothin'.
I'll take whatever I can get, Al.

830
00:57:49.547 --> 00:57:53.005
- Whatever you say.
- That's right, baby-cake.

831
00:57:53.084 --> 00:57:55.143
I knew you'd
wise up, sunshine.

832
00:57:55.219 --> 00:57:57.687
That greaser pimp can't do
half what I can do for you.

833
00:57:57.755 --> 00:58:01.919
- Sounds nice.
- Hey, Gil. Tell Red Ryder I got that protein powder he wanted.

834
00:58:06.697 --> 00:58:10.531
See that? You learn to treat me
right and you get it all.

835
00:58:10.601 --> 00:58:13.035
Food, coffee,
sex, drugs.

836
00:58:13.104 --> 00:58:15.265
Hell, the works.
Come on over here.

837
00:58:15.339 --> 00:58:17.307
Hey, clear outta here.

838
00:58:18.909 --> 00:58:21.173
It's off-limits to everybody
but me and the staff.

839
00:58:23.614 --> 00:58:26.947
Go on in.
Hey... you like that?

840
00:58:27.017 --> 00:58:30.043
Oh, that's nice.

841
00:58:30.121 --> 00:58:32.487
Yeah, so's this.

842
00:58:37.128 --> 00:58:39.358
So this is where you
keep all the goodies, huh?

843
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:41.489
Some of'em.

844
00:58:44.735 --> 00:58:48.193
- Pinto beans?
- No pintos for you, baby.

845
00:58:48.272 --> 00:58:50.570
Nothin' but
Texas barbecue.

846
00:58:53.244 --> 00:58:55.371
How 'bout it,
sweet teeth?

847
00:58:55.446 --> 00:58:57.539
Just remember, Al.

848
00:58:57.615 --> 00:59:01.449
I fuck who I want,
when I want.

849
00:59:01.519 --> 00:59:04.784
All right. It's all right.
Take it easy. It's all right.

850
00:59:04.855 --> 00:59:09.758
You treat me right, everything's
gonna be all crimson and clover.

851
00:59:12.129 --> 00:59:15.496
Popeye tried to take it.
Almost cut his dick off!

852
00:59:18.335 --> 00:59:20.428
Well, I can wait, baby.

853
00:59:20.504 --> 00:59:24.133
That spic's a pig.
Got no class.

854
00:59:24.208 --> 00:59:27.143
Just don't make Daddy
wait too long.

855
00:59:28.312 --> 00:59:30.507
Come on, now.
Come on.

856
00:59:55.372 --> 00:59:59.069
- You wild little bitch.
- This is just a sample.

857
00:59:59.143 --> 01:00:04.137
<i>- I'm gonna fuck your brains out!
- When I'm ready, Al.</i>

858
01:00:04.215 --> 01:00:06.445
<i>When I'm ready.</i>

859
01:00:21.483 --> 01:00:24.281
<i>*</i>

860
01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:28.550
<i> ç Ay, mi hijo!
The prices, they're so high.</i>

861
01:00:28.623 --> 01:00:31.820
<i> The prices don't mean nothing
unless they sell that much.</i>

862
01:00:31.893 --> 01:00:34.054
Cruz, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

863
01:00:34.128 --> 01:00:36.995
- I'm saying good-bye to my family.
- We were just leaving.

864
01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:45.434
Hey, Cruz, can you buy me
a low-rider when you get rich?

865
01:00:45.506 --> 01:00:48.134
<i>- ¿Que low-rider? Ç Andale! Usted tambien,
senorita. - I wanna stay with Cruz.</i>

866
01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:50.268
- Bye, Alicia.
- Come with me, Cruz.

867
01:00:50.345 --> 01:00:54.076
<i> People want to meet you. You've
got to circulate. You're the artist.</i>

868
01:00:57.218 --> 01:01:00.779
- Janis!
- Oh, God.

869
01:01:00.855 --> 01:01:06.054
- Janis, what a find.
- Cruz, say hello to Lois and Jared Levinson.

870
01:01:06.127 --> 01:01:08.857
<i>Cruz Candelaria.
Mucho gusto.</i>

871
01:01:10.665 --> 01:01:14.863
<i>You, uh, make them look so noble.
So, uh... fuerte.</i>

872
01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:20.706
I paint what I see.
So you really like it, huh?

873
01:01:20.775 --> 01:01:23.676
<i>-  Oh, yes.
- I'm sorry, but I've gotta take him to a press photo.</i>

874
01:01:23.745 --> 01:01:25.679
<i>- We'll bring him back in a few minutes.
- All right.</i>

875
01:01:25.747 --> 01:01:28.011
Janis, what are
you doing?

876
01:01:28.082 --> 01:01:30.778
- They were gonna buy something.
- Oh, they're looky-loos.

877
01:01:30.852 --> 01:01:32.877
- Window-shoppers.
- How do you know that, Janis?

878
01:01:32.954 --> 01:01:35.149
I thought we agreed to keep
tonight strictly business.

879
01:01:35.223 --> 01:01:37.418
Yeah. So?

880
01:01:38.493 --> 01:01:42.088
They went in.
How come they went in?

881
01:01:42.163 --> 01:01:44.222
We both have
a lot at stake, Cruz.

882
01:01:44.299 --> 01:01:46.358
Don't let them
blow it.

883
01:01:47.635 --> 01:01:49.933
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

884
01:01:50.004 --> 01:01:51.972
Gentlemen, your names
are not on the list,

885
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.201
and if you don't have an invitation,
you can't come in here.

886
01:01:54.275 --> 01:01:57.403
<i>Look, we don't need our names
on the list, ruca.</i>

887
01:01:57.478 --> 01:01:59.412
<i>You see that face
up there? That's me.</i>

888
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.607
<i> Whether that's you
or not, it doesn't matter.</i>

889
01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:03.708
Miss Weinstock needs to say
that it's okay for you to come in.

890
01:02:03.785 --> 01:02:06.652
<i>Orale. Have yourselves a good time. Enjoy
yourselves. There, there's my invitation.</i>

891
01:02:06.721 --> 01:02:08.518
<i>-  Okay? Gracias.
- </i>

892
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:11.581
<i>Hey, hey, hey. It's okay, Belinda.
It's all right.</i>

893
01:02:11.659 --> 01:02:16.426
<i>-  It's okay, Belinda.
- ¿Que paso, locos?</i>

894
01:02:16.497 --> 01:02:19.557
Hey, Cruzito.
Congratulations.

895
01:02:22.837 --> 01:02:24.862
<i>Orale, Gilbert.
In a minute, homes.</i>

896
01:02:24.939 --> 01:02:26.964
<i> Come check out
the carrucha, carnal.</i>

897
01:02:27.041 --> 01:02:29.407
<i>- Orale.
- Orale, Cruzito.</i>

898
01:02:29.477 --> 01:02:32.640
"Cruz Candelaria," vato.
This is big time, homes.

899
01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:38.643
<i>Oye, it's too bright
in here, ese. Too much white.</i>

900
01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.915
Hey, Cruzito, homes.

901
01:02:40.988 --> 01:02:44.082
What happened to
our invitation?

902
01:02:44.158 --> 01:02:46.092
What, are you
ashamed of Frankie?

903
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.061
<i>- Are you ashamed of me?
- Si, babosos. I'm glad you came.</i>

904
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:51.257
<i>But why'd you have to
bring Gilbert, that culero.</i>

905
01:02:51.332 --> 01:02:53.766
You know Gilbert can smell money
from across town, homes.

906
01:02:53.835 --> 01:02:55.962
<i>- No shit.
- He came to help you spend that plata.</i>

907
01:02:56.037 --> 01:02:58.005
Oh, shit, I can't
pay him now, ese.

908
01:02:58.072 --> 01:03:00.734
<i>No mas tengo diez bolas.
I've only got ten bucks to my name.</i>

909
01:03:00.808 --> 01:03:04.437
- What, with those prices?
- Hey, shit, I ain't sold nothing, ese.

910
01:03:04.512 --> 01:03:07.879
<i>Well, maybe if we jack up
a few of these maricones, vato.</i>

911
01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:09.940
I got the guy
in the bell-bottoms.

912
01:03:10.017 --> 01:03:12.076
- And I'll take everyone without a bra, vato.
- Be cool, ese.

913
01:03:12.153 --> 01:03:15.247
- I'm trying to hold it together.
- Gilbert wants his full payback...

914
01:03:15.323 --> 01:03:17.484
- before he's gonna give me some new credit.
- Shh. Quiet.

915
01:03:17.558 --> 01:03:21.517
<i>- No, you fu...
- Shh. Calmate, vato. Relax.</i>

916
01:03:21.596 --> 01:03:23.894
<i>Here, have some pisto.</i>

917
01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:27.767
I'll see what I can do,
all right?

918
01:03:27.835 --> 01:03:30.463
- He says he'll take this price.
- Tell him I'm not negotiating.

919
01:03:30.538 --> 01:03:34.133
<i>-  The price is so low now, it's a steal.
- He'll probably pass.</i>

920
01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:36.369
That'll be his loss.

921
01:03:46.487 --> 01:03:50.617
Listen, Janis, I need a cash advance.
Can you help me?

922
01:03:50.691 --> 01:03:52.659
I've already given you
three advances.

923
01:03:52.727 --> 01:03:58.666
I need some money, Janis. What good is it
to have a show if I don't sell anything?

924
01:03:58.733 --> 01:04:03.534
Cruz, most of your paintings are already
spoken for by important collectors.

925
01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:09.376
- What?
- You'll be completely sold out by the end of the night.

926
01:04:12.013 --> 01:04:14.038
Sold out? All of it?

927
01:04:16.451 --> 01:04:18.646
Then why can't I get
some money tonight?

928
01:04:18.719 --> 01:04:23.053
It doesn't work that way. The checks
go to the accountant to be processed.

929
01:04:23.124 --> 01:04:27.060
No, I need some money now!
Do you understand me? Tonight.

930
01:04:28.296 --> 01:04:32.392
Come on. I sold out,
so I deserve some, right?

931
01:04:34.469 --> 01:04:36.596
You've got a brilliant career
ahead of you, Cruz.

932
01:04:36.671 --> 01:04:39.401
<i>But all that talent can
go right in the garbage.</i>

933
01:04:39.474 --> 01:04:42.238
Think about that when you're getting
high with your friends tonight.

934
01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:46.838
Please, no Baptist sermons, okay,
Janis? Strictly business, remember?

935
01:04:55.823 --> 01:05:02.490
Thank you.

936
01:05:13.474 --> 01:05:15.772
You know, he really
is a genius, though.

937
01:05:15.843 --> 01:05:18.869
- And the amazing thing... he's never even been...

938
01:05:18.946 --> 01:05:22.313
- Hey, Belinda, Belinda.

939
01:05:22.383 --> 01:05:25.614
Here's my ticket.

940
01:05:25.686 --> 01:05:29.349
Belinda, you're too uptight.
Come on, this is my show.

941
01:05:29.423 --> 01:05:32.586
Hey, hey.

942
01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.594
I want to
present you my friends.

943
01:05:34.662 --> 01:05:38.894
- This is Lois and Jerry.
- Jared.

944
01:05:38.966 --> 01:05:40.900
- You had a good time tonight, huh?

945
01:05:40.968 --> 01:05:43.960
Hey, Cruzito!
Cruzito!

946
01:05:44.038 --> 01:05:46.529
Cruz!
Hey, homes, homes.

947
01:05:46.607 --> 01:05:51.306
<i>Hey, you made me look
like a cholo, ese.</i>

948
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:04.280
<i></i>

949
01:06:15.303 --> 01:06:17.203
- Daniel.
- Mm-hmm.

950
01:06:17.271 --> 01:06:19.364
Get them on their feet
and out the door.

951
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.035
Artists, folks.
Just artists being artists.

952
01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:26.705
Drink up, enjoy yourselves.
We got art on the walls, on the floor.

953
01:06:26.781 --> 01:06:31.081
This is a happening. We are going to
read about this tomorrow in the paper.

954
01:06:31.152 --> 01:06:34.644
Let's celebrate
artistic freedom.

955
01:06:34.722 --> 01:06:37.691
You had all this planned, didn't you?
It's part of the exhibit.

956
01:06:37.758 --> 01:06:40.056
<i> I got a hot tip, Al.
How's my credit?</i>

957
01:06:40.127 --> 01:06:42.493
<i> Ryder, your credit's
as tight and firm as...</i>

958
01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:45.088
Oh, come on.
Don't be that-a-way.

959
01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:47.225
Nothin' like poppin'
a cherry, huh, Al?

960
01:06:47.301 --> 01:06:49.428
Red Ryder, your mouth,
your mouth.

961
01:06:49.503 --> 01:06:51.869
- Lakers won in overtime, Al.

962
01:06:51.939 --> 01:06:55.136
Oh! Give him a green one.
No, the other green one.

963
01:06:56.644 --> 01:06:59.772
Why do you keep bettin' on them
L.A. Teams, Lightning?

964
01:06:59.847 --> 01:07:03.442
You just keep payin' up, Al, and
everything's gonna be just fine.

965
01:07:07.154 --> 01:07:09.588
She looks a little
bowlegged to me, Al.

966
01:07:09.657 --> 01:07:11.591
You're gonna always
be runner-up, punk.

967
01:07:14.362 --> 01:07:17.798
<i>I'm still gonna cut that
V.L. placa off of you, sissy.</i>

968
01:07:17.865 --> 01:07:22.063
Hey, Pancho, don't be a sore loser.
Get the fuck outta here.

969
01:07:28.676 --> 01:07:31.577
I don't want that greaser pimp
even talkin' to you. Understand me?

970
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.418
<i>
Tomorrow is your day, guero.</i>

971
01:07:37.485 --> 01:07:40.818
Tonight, you must read
the black book.

972
01:07:47.662 --> 01:07:49.687
These are
the killing points.

973
01:07:49.764 --> 01:07:52.597
The arrows show
where a man can be killed.

974
01:07:52.667 --> 01:07:55.295
Hit a man here or here,

975
01:07:55.369 --> 01:07:58.202
and he dies slowly
and painfully.

976
01:07:58.272 --> 01:08:01.901
Hit a man here... or here,

977
01:08:01.976 --> 01:08:03.910
and he dies instantly.

978
01:08:10.317 --> 01:08:12.581
<i> When you get
to the kitchen in the morning,</i>

979
01:08:12.653 --> 01:08:15.747
look in
the largest stock pot.

980
01:08:15.823 --> 01:08:17.791
Geronimo will be watching.

981
01:08:20.194 --> 01:08:24.255
If you're successful tomorrow,
you'll become one of us.

982
01:08:24.331 --> 01:08:26.356
If you fail, you die.

983
01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.114
Hey, no,
I got that, Howie.

984
01:08:41.182 --> 01:08:43.844
- Let a real man do the job.
- It's all yours.

985
01:08:58.799 --> 01:09:03.395
All right, you slaves! I want them
things clean in one hour. Now move it!

986
01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.439
You, get to work.

987
01:09:05.506 --> 01:09:08.737
<i> Now you heard the man.
Let's do it.</i>

988
01:09:56.557 --> 01:09:59.993
That stuff's burnin'
my back! Oh!

989
01:10:01.662 --> 01:10:04.688
<i>-  It hurts!
-  I know it hurts. I can't do nothin'!</i>

990
01:10:04.765 --> 01:10:10.328
<i></i>

991
01:10:46.373 --> 01:10:49.900
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing in here?

992
01:10:49.977 --> 01:10:53.140
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I didn't know.

993
01:10:53.214 --> 01:10:55.341
- What are you doing in here?
- I didn't do anything!

994
01:10:55.416 --> 01:10:58.908
- This room is off-limits.
- You shouldn't be in here, baby-cakes.

995
01:10:58.986 --> 01:11:01.955
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry, I just wanted some more steel wool.

996
01:11:02.022 --> 01:11:04.183
You are fuckin' up, Al,
lettin' this kid in here.

997
01:11:04.258 --> 01:11:06.749
- It's okay, Bob, he's cool.
- Bullshit! Nobody else is supposed to know...

998
01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:09.091
- I won't say anything. - Shut
up! - It's all right, Sergeant.

999
01:11:09.163 --> 01:11:12.462
- He does what I say.
- I am not risking everything for some piece of ass!

1000
01:11:12.533 --> 01:11:17.163
Just a goddamn minute. You get paid
plenty for your risk, right? Am I right?

1001
01:11:17.238 --> 01:11:19.570
Shh!

1002
01:11:23.344 --> 01:11:25.778
- Yeah, right.
- Well, all right, then. Now get movin'.

1003
01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.780
We got plenty of trips
for you to make.

1004
01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:31.011
<i> Remember, I got a receipt for
every dollar you got in that money belt.</i>

1005
01:11:31.085 --> 01:11:33.280
Hey, what the fuck
you lookin' at?

1006
01:11:33.354 --> 01:11:37.450
Get your ass right there
and stand there and don't move!

1007
01:11:37.524 --> 01:11:41.483
Bob, cover that money up! How long will it
take you to get back here from the parking lot?

1008
01:11:41.562 --> 01:11:44.395
- Fifteen minutes.
- All right, I expect you back here in ten.

1009
01:11:44.465 --> 01:11:46.797
<i>- Keep this damn door closed.
-  Don't give me orders!</i>

1010
01:11:46.867 --> 01:11:48.960
<i>Just make sure nobody
sees you leaving here.</i>

1011
01:11:49.036 --> 01:11:50.799
Goddamn you,
you little bastard!

1012
01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:55.774
Don't you ever do that again or I'll
kill you! Now get the fuck outta here!

1013
01:11:55.843 --> 01:11:59.404
<i>You little prick tease! I'm tired of you
swingin'your precious little ass around...</i>

1014
01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.607
<i>like you own
the joint!</i>

1015
01:12:01.682 --> 01:12:04.810
<i>- You haven't put out worth shit!
- I'm sorry, Al.</i>

1016
01:12:04.885 --> 01:12:06.876
I fucked up.
I know.

1017
01:12:06.954 --> 01:12:09.320
Forgive me.
I thought you were alone.

1018
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:12.791
<i>- Get out!
- Please don't hold it against me.</i>

1019
01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.987
- Shut up!
- Please?

1020
01:12:15.062 --> 01:12:18.088
Let me
make it up to you.

1021
01:12:18.165 --> 01:12:23.034
I know I've held back, but I'm not
gonna do it anymore.

1022
01:12:27.975 --> 01:12:30.876
We don't have a lotta time!
Come on.

1023
01:12:31.979 --> 01:12:34.106
Let's get to it.

1024
01:12:38.152 --> 01:12:39.915
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

1025
01:12:39.987 --> 01:12:42.387
I'm gonna lick you clean.

1026
01:12:42.456 --> 01:12:45.254
- Do it, bitch.
- Lay back and enjoy it.

1027
01:13:55.496 --> 01:13:58.761
- I'm all right, I'm tellin' you. It was an accident.
- Shit!

1028
01:13:58.832 --> 01:14:01.323
- Hey, I'm tellin' you...
- Let's cut the shit.

1029
01:14:01.402 --> 01:14:03.393
You're affiliated with
La Onda, aren't you?

1030
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:05.404
Lieutenant, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1031
01:14:05.472 --> 01:14:08.407
You tryin' to insult my intelligence?
You're Onda, he's B.G.A.

1032
01:14:08.475 --> 01:14:11.672
Look, I know you're the gang coordinator,
but you side on the wolf ticket.

1033
01:14:24.324 --> 01:14:27.350
- Shit!
-  Don't bullshit me.

1034
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:41.432
<i> I wanna get outta here.
I can make something of my life.</i>

1035
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:51.775
Hell, I told you
to keep the door...

1036
01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.894
Fuckin' little shit!

1037
01:15:04.164 --> 01:15:06.724
<i> Okay, gentlemen,
it was just an accident.</i>

1038
01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.963
Get back to work.
You got breakfast to make.

1039
01:15:13.574 --> 01:15:15.667
<i></i>

1040
01:15:15.742 --> 01:15:19.769
Man down! Let's go! Storage room!
Man down! Let's go!

1041
01:15:28.622 --> 01:15:31.420
<i> Goddamn it!
You all wanna fuck with me?</i>

1042
01:15:31.492 --> 01:15:34.552
<i>Sergeant, I want you
to shake this place down!</i>

1043
01:15:34.628 --> 01:15:38.428
I want the I.D. And background
on every man in here.

1044
01:15:38.499 --> 01:15:40.433
<i> All right, I wanna
know who did it.</i>

1045
01:15:40.501 --> 01:15:43.493
<i>Somebody in here gets 25 years
or you're all dead. Take your pick.</i>

1046
01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.595
<i>You shut up!
I wanna know who did it!</i>

1047
01:15:45.672 --> 01:15:47.640
<i>Everybody in here
goes into lock-down!</i>

1048
01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:51.371
No exercise, no rec room,
no sunshine!

1049
01:15:51.445 --> 01:15:55.472
Get outta there! No nothin'
until I get some answers!

1050
01:15:55.549 --> 01:15:59.485
And until I do, you're not
gonna see the light of day!

1051
01:15:59.553 --> 01:16:01.748
<i> Sergeant Devereaux!</i>

1052
01:16:01.822 --> 01:16:05.451
Sergeant Devereaux, I want you
to strip-search these men.

1053
01:16:05.526 --> 01:16:08.495
<i>Everyone here
is gonna do time in the hole.</i>

1054
01:16:08.562 --> 01:16:10.860
<i>- Hey, big fella!
- You'll get it.</i>

1055
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:13.126
<i>- Sarge, where's the food?
- You'll get it. It's on its way.</i>

1056
01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.134
<i>Come on with
the damn food, man!</i>

1057
01:16:15.202 --> 01:16:19.263
If I don't get that damn book and money back,
you're not gonna walk off this cell block alive!

1058
01:16:19.339 --> 01:16:22.672
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Your name's in that book, Bob.

1059
01:16:22.743 --> 01:16:27.339
If I don't stay real healthy, the warden's
gonna find it in the suggestion box.

1060
01:16:29.683 --> 01:16:31.651
- Hey, Bob.
- What?

1061
01:16:31.718 --> 01:16:34.278
Can I get
an extra dessert tomorrow?

1062
01:16:34.354 --> 01:16:38.950
<i> Just push this cart
over here! Let's move, man!</i>

1063
01:16:39.026 --> 01:16:40.994
<i>I'm gettin'hungry
up here!</i>

1064
01:16:41.061 --> 01:16:44.189
Shut the fuck up!

1065
01:16:44.264 --> 01:16:47.563
<i>-  Whose are they?
- They're a friend of my brother's, homes.</i>

1066
01:16:47.634 --> 01:16:49.568
But he won't say shit.
He's asleep anyway.

1067
01:16:49.636 --> 01:16:53.436
- You're gonna get in trouble if he wakes up.
- Nah, fuck that.

1068
01:16:53.507 --> 01:16:55.532
All right, eh!
See you later, homes.

1069
01:16:55.609 --> 01:16:58.840
- He's gonna get pissed at you.
- Nah, I'll kick his ass.

- Hey, man. This ain't no playground.

1073
01:17:09.856 --> 01:17:13.553
<i>- Damn!
- Oye, pendejo, you don't know how to knock?</i>

1074
01:17:13.627 --> 01:17:16.289
I'm sorry, eh. But it's cool.
I know what's up.

1075
01:17:16.363 --> 01:17:18.456
<i>Chale, it ain't cool,
and you don't know what's up.</i>

1076
01:17:18.532 --> 01:17:21.968
<i>But ¿sabes que, homes? You better learn,
or else you can't come here no more.</i>

1077
01:17:22.035 --> 01:17:25.471
- You understand?
- I'm sorry.

1078
01:17:25.539 --> 01:17:29.270
Your place is great,
and I wanna come back.

1079
01:17:29.343 --> 01:17:33.006
<i>Okay, carnalito, but be cool. You can't
just barge in anywhere you want.</i>

1080
01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.480
- All right.
- Go upstairs and watch TV until Mom comes.

1081
01:17:35.549 --> 01:17:38.814
<i>Simon.
I took his shoes and threw them.</i>

1082
01:17:38.885 --> 01:17:40.750
<i>
Pendejo. Go on.</i>

1083
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:44.018
Go upstairs and practice so you can
be a badass like Bobby Chacon.

1084
01:17:44.091 --> 01:17:46.218
<i>- Simon, eh.
- Hey, hey, hey.</i>

1085
01:17:46.293 --> 01:17:49.592
<i>Tell Mom that my back was hurting,
so I had to take a nap, all right?</i>

1086
01:17:49.663 --> 01:17:52.689
<i>- Yeah.
- Ya, lepe.</i>

1087
01:17:54.568 --> 01:17:57.765
<i>Oye, baboso.
What the fuck's wrong with you?</i>

1088
01:17:57.838 --> 01:18:01.433
<i>You can't fuckin'be sonando yourself

- It's cool, homes.
- It ain't cool, homes.

1090
01:18:06.179 --> 01:18:08.545
Come on, Cruzito.

1091
01:18:08.615 --> 01:18:11.675
Come on, eh.
Come on down.

1092
01:18:11.752 --> 01:18:16.655
<i>This will cure
your back pain, homes.</i>

1093
01:18:16.723 --> 01:18:21.751
<i> Oh! Painting those
22 masks is a drag, homes.</i>

1094
01:18:21.828 --> 01:18:24.888
I'm tired of this
assembly-line shit!

1095
01:18:24.965 --> 01:18:28.366
It's money in
the bank, Cruzito.

<i>*It's all right
She said it's all right</i>

01:18:42.449 --> 01:18:46.749
<i>- Take anything you want...

1099
01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:51.484
<i>Hey, paint some
rucas naked.</i>

1100
01:18:51.558 --> 01:18:56.461
<i>- Oh, man!
- Ese, I don't wanna spend the rest of my life...</i>

1101
01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:58.964
decorating rich people's
fucking living rooms.

1102
01:19:01.134 --> 01:19:04.433
I wanna do
something different, ese.

1103
01:19:04.504 --> 01:19:07.166
<i>¿Tu sabes?</i>

1104
01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.176
You know, the way that
I see it, Cruzito...

01:19:12.813 --> 01:19:17.750
You know, homes, you take the money
and you run, vato.

1106
01:19:17.818 --> 01:19:20.548
<i>- ¿Que no?
- Yeah.</i>

1107
01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:22.850
I'll peddle
for you, eh.

1108
01:19:28.662 --> 01:19:31.631
- Fuck 'em, man. I'll paint what I feel.
- Hmm.

1109
01:19:31.698 --> 01:19:34.895
<i>*Fly on, little wing</i>

1110
01:20:01.728 --> 01:20:03.753
<i> This is your
bautismo, guero.</i>

1111
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:07.027
We created La Onda,
the seven of us.

1112
01:20:09.536 --> 01:20:12.266
This is the inner circle.

1113
01:20:12.339 --> 01:20:16.776
<i>Every one is a capitan
and commands his own soldiers.</i>

1114
01:20:16.843 --> 01:20:20.472
<i>We all have an equal vote,
but I am the elected spokesman.</i>

1115
01:20:22.249 --> 01:20:25.013
<i>This is the last time
you will ever sit in the circle.</i>

1116
01:20:26.686 --> 01:20:30.087
<i>You've proven yourself, so we're
admitting you into Onda.</i>

1117
01:20:30.157 --> 01:20:32.717
<i>It's a commitment
for life.</i>

1118
01:20:32.793 --> 01:20:37.355
<i>As a soldier, you will answer to this council
and carry out our orders without question.</i>

1119
01:20:38.698 --> 01:20:41.531
<i>Failure to do so
is death.</i>

1120
01:21:02.756 --> 01:21:05.316
Blood in...

1121
01:21:05.392 --> 01:21:07.383
blood out.

1122
01:21:11.465 --> 01:21:13.956
<i>Hijo,
te traje la...</i>

1123
01:21:16.803 --> 01:21:20.034
<i>ç Ay, no!</i>

1124
01:21:20.106 --> 01:21:23.166
<i>Ç Ay, Dios mio, no!</i>

1125
01:21:24.244 --> 01:21:27.645
<i>Ç Ay, mi hijo!
Please, somebody!</i>

1126
01:21:27.714 --> 01:21:31.206
Juanito? No!

1127
01:21:31.284 --> 01:21:33.718
God!

1128
01:21:33.787 --> 01:21:36.779
Help!
Somebody, please, help!

1129
01:21:36.857 --> 01:21:38.882
<i>Help!</i>

1130
01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.824
<i>Ç Juanito!
Ç Por favor, Juanito!</i>

1131
01:21:42.896 --> 01:21:46.423
<i>- Ç Ay, mi hijo!
- Mom, ¿que paso?</i>

1132
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.264
Don't touch him!
Don't touch him! Leave him alone!

1133
01:21:49.336 --> 01:21:51.236
Ç Oh, mi hijo!

1134
01:21:51.304 --> 01:21:55.638
Oh! Stop it! You...
You did this, you bastard!

1135
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:57.939
- We gotta get outta here, Cruzito!
- Juanito!

1136
01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:59.979
<i>- There's nothing
left! - Cruz! - Ç Chale!</i>

1137
01:22:00.046 --> 01:22:02.173
Please bring
my baby back. Please.

1138
01:22:02.249 --> 01:22:06.413
There's nothing we can do! If we don't
get outta here, we're fucked!

1139
01:22:06.486 --> 01:22:09.080
Okay?
Come on, please.

1140
01:22:09.155 --> 01:22:11.385
- Juanito!
- Come on!

1141
01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:12.891
<i>Ç Ama!</i>

1142
01:22:14.294 --> 01:22:19.960
Please get up. You can do it.
Get up, Juanito. Get up!

1143
01:22:20.033 --> 01:22:21.967
Oh, God, no!

1144
01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:26.665
<i> The Lord is my shepherd,
There is nothing I shall want.</i>

1145
01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:30.643
<i>Fresh and green are the pastures
where He gives me repose,:</i>

1146
01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:35.775
<i>Near restful waters He leads me
to revive my drooping spirit.</i>

1147
01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:40.219
<i>Surely goodness and kindness shall
follow me all the days of my life,</i>

1148
01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:42.586
<i>and in the Lord's own house
shall I dwell.</i>

1149
01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:15.020
Let us begin. In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

1150
01:23:19.727 --> 01:23:21.820
<i>Apa.</i>

1151
01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:25.195
<i>-  This is a reading from the first letter ofJohn.
- Forgive me.</i>

1152
01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:28.895
<i>Perdoname, apa.</i>

1153
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:32.565
Not now!
Not ever!

1154
01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.905
You are dead to me,
likeJuanito.

1155
01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:42.846
Let us pray.

1156
01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:48.116
<i>LordJesus Christ, by Your own
three days in the tomb,</i>

1157
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:52.717
<i>You allowed the graves of all
who believe in You to be made holy,</i>

1158
01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:57.356
<i>so You made the grave a sign
of hope that promises resurrection,</i>

1159
01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:00.333
<i>even as it claims
our mortal bodies.</i>

1160
01:24:00.401 --> 01:24:04.895
<i>Grant that our brother, Juanito,
may sleep here in peace...</i>

1161
01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:07.601
<i>until You awaken him
to glory.</i>

1162
01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:09.666
<i>Then he will see You
face to face,</i>

1163
01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:12.804
<i>and in Your light,
we shall see life...</i>

1164
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.973
<i>and know
the splendor of God,</i>

1165
01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:18.507
<i>for You live
forever and ever. Amen.</i>

1166
01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:26.217
<i>It's okay, jefito.</i>

1167
01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:28.785
<i> You can cry if you want.</i>

1168
01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:39.369
<i></i>

1169
01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.870
The Aryan Vanguard's
been insulted.

1170
01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:46.675
You spics knew Big Al had
an insurance policy with the A.V.

1171
01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:52.209
So when your little lamb strays from
the flock... I'm gonna kill the boy!

1172
01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:56.285
I heard that.

1173
01:24:58.092 --> 01:25:00.083
<i> Al deserved to die.</i>

1174
01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:04.291
Besides, your AV-ers owed him
more money than anybody else.

1175
01:25:04.365 --> 01:25:06.333
So you made out fine.

1176
01:25:12.473 --> 01:25:14.441
He still dies.

1177
01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:18.707
The council has authorized me
to make a substantial cash offer...

1178
01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.146
to assure nothing happens
to Miklo.

1179
01:25:21.215 --> 01:25:23.342
I'm listenin'.

1180
01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:27.684
Half of Al's cash.
$8,000.

1181
01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:30.019
<i> We're now open
for business.</i>

1182
01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:34.323
<i>We'll give you personally 25% of every
bet we collect from one of your members.</i>

1183
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:38.490
<i>You don't give me squat!</i>

1184
01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:42.229
<i>You don't even do business
unless I say you can.</i>

1185
01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.237
<i>You understand?</i>

1186
01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.239
So?

1187
01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:51.368
So, what are you givin'
on the Lakers-76ers?

1188
01:25:51.446 --> 01:25:54.472
<i>Give the puto four
on 76.</i>

1189
01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:58.747
<i>The 76ers... and four points.</i>

1190
01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:05.717
Gimme the Lakers
for a hundred.

1191
01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:08.284
I'll take some of
that action myself.

1192
01:26:14.034 --> 01:26:16.969
<i> Miklo, if Onda's going
into business, carnal,</i>

1193
01:26:17.037 --> 01:26:19.130
<i>people have to know
they can trust us.</i>

1194
01:26:19.206 --> 01:26:22.004
<i>So treat everybody
the same.</i>

1195
01:26:22.075 --> 01:26:26.273
<i>The AV-ers control the dope and the
BGA-ers are trying to move in on them.</i>

1196
01:26:26.346 --> 01:26:28.712
<i>Let 'em fight it out
while we build our bank account.</i>

1197
01:26:28.782 --> 01:26:31.080
<i>We'll do business
with both of them.</i>

1198
01:26:31.151 --> 01:26:35.781
<i>Money knows no color, carnal.
Everybody likes to gamble.</i>

1199
01:26:35.856 --> 01:26:38.723
<i> All right, all you little old
ladies! It's the milkman!</i>

1200
01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:41.522
Come on. It's time to collect
all that milk money!

1201
01:26:41.595 --> 01:26:45.258
It's all I can do.
I'll give you a half a point.

1202
01:26:45.332 --> 01:26:48.267
- That's the point spread. Gotta be cool, bro.
- Be cool.

1203
01:26:48.335 --> 01:26:52.863
<i>Jefe, here's some produce, freshly
picked right outta the fields.</i>

1204
01:26:57.344 --> 01:27:02.976
<i>Ç Ay! Christmastime! Pancho Villa,
Virgen de Guadalupe, gracias.</i>

1205
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:08.647
<i>Huacha, from now on I want 40% of
everything we make set aside for legal fees.</i>

1206
01:27:08.722 --> 01:27:11.486
<i>We gotta start helping
our gente get outta here.</i>

1207
01:27:11.558 --> 01:27:14.049
<i>Use 20% for Christmas presents
for the carnales.</i>

1208
01:27:14.127 --> 01:27:16.652
You should be ashamed!
Quit looking at boobs.

1209
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:20.166
<i>Look at a boob tube, compliments
from El Mero Mero.</i>

1210
01:27:20.233 --> 01:27:24.533
My B.G.A. Brothers! Pockets!
Gotta get rid of that natural look.

1211
01:27:24.604 --> 01:27:26.538
Go back
to processing.

1212
01:27:26.606 --> 01:27:29.803
- Look like me, vato, huh?
- Hey, how 'about those Raiders, chump?

1213
01:27:29.876 --> 01:27:33.004
Heh-heh!
B.G.A. Is always right.

1214
01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:37.016
<i> Got a special sale for tomorrow
night's fight. It's gonna be two-for-one, bro.</i>

1215
01:27:37.084 --> 01:27:39.678
<i>Two for me
and one for you!</i>

1216
01:27:39.753 --> 01:27:44.554
<i>Hey, man, don't talk to me about credit.
I got debts as thick as a phone book.</i>

1217
01:27:44.624 --> 01:27:48.958
<i> Now that Mosca and Flaco
are getting transferred to Chino,</i>

1218
01:27:49.029 --> 01:27:51.657
<i>we'll have a base close
to the courts in Los Angeles.</i>

1219
01:27:51.732 --> 01:27:55.896
<i>Give 'em some money so they can set up
a legal fund, recruit some soldiers.</i>

1220
01:27:55.969 --> 01:27:58.096
<i> You got it, Jefe.</i>

1221
01:27:58.171 --> 01:28:01.607
Hey, milkweed.

1222
01:28:01.675 --> 01:28:07.011
My plan to join our business
and share profits, I like it, ese.

1223
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.210
- I don't.
- Where you goin', ese?

1224
01:28:12.386 --> 01:28:15.287
Hey, hey, hey, homes.
Hey, I'm sorry.

1225
01:28:15.355 --> 01:28:19.485
<i>Hey, hey, mira. Look, uh, it's about
that little debt, you know?</i>

1226
01:28:19.559 --> 01:28:21.993
- Not so little.
- Hey, I'm booking next week, homes.

1227
01:28:22.062 --> 01:28:24.997
I got my parole, you know?
I need my cash for the streets.

1228
01:28:25.065 --> 01:28:29.661
- It's hard to get set up out there, you know?
- Gotta pay part of it.

1229
01:28:29.736 --> 01:28:32.830
I can do better than that.
Put you on the council.

1230
01:28:32.906 --> 01:28:36.000
You could be one of the seven.
Motada's been wenting you in.

1231
01:28:36.076 --> 01:28:40.308
He needs my vote.
Erase my debt, and you're in.

1232
01:28:45.619 --> 01:28:47.610
Okay, Popeye.

1233
01:28:47.687 --> 01:28:50.656
There'll be a blank space
next to your name in my book.

1234
01:28:50.724 --> 01:28:56.754
I'll keep it up here
in my memory.

1235
01:28:56.830 --> 01:29:01.199
Orale, carnales. You'll be tied in good when
you get out. Whatever you want, just ask.

1236
01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:11.976
<i> Come on. This is
my parole picture.</i>

1237
01:29:12.045 --> 01:29:14.411
Hey, you only get
paroled once.

1238
01:29:14.481 --> 01:29:16.949
Magic, something
to remember you by.

1239
01:29:17.017 --> 01:29:19.781
All right, okay.
Here we are now.

1240
01:29:19.853 --> 01:29:21.878
All right, vato,
take a picture.

1241
01:29:21.955 --> 01:29:23.923
Oh, come on.
Hey, I got people waiting.

1242
01:29:26.259 --> 01:29:28.659
<i>- Ready?
- Andale.</i>

1243
01:29:28.728 --> 01:29:31.424
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

1244
01:29:38.304 --> 01:29:40.966
<i> You know, I grew up
about ten blocks from here,</i>

1245
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.634
<i>but this place
blows my mind, Carmen.</i>

1246
01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:46.542
<i>Looks like
Hawaii, man.</i>

1247
01:29:46.612 --> 01:29:49.012
My father planted this
40 years ago.

1248
01:29:50.650 --> 01:29:52.845
Created the whole
Yucatan right here.

1249
01:29:54.387 --> 01:29:57.322
Carmen's the best chef
in all of East Los.

1250
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:59.551
- That right?
- Uh-huh.

1251
01:30:03.362 --> 01:30:05.592
Suck on this
licorice stick.

1252
01:30:07.767 --> 01:30:13.603
It's been dipped 20 times
to make you hump all night long, Paco.

1253
01:30:13.673 --> 01:30:18.610
<i>With you two around, I ain't gonna need
no marriage counselor. ¿Que no?</i>

1254
01:30:23.282 --> 01:30:25.716
<i>
I like your style, Paquito.</i>

1255
01:30:25.785 --> 01:30:29.687
I'll check it out. I know this shit is
good, 'cause like the last batch you made,

1256
01:30:29.755 --> 01:30:32.280
<i>was dynamite, man.</i>

1257
01:30:32.358 --> 01:30:36.920
But the only trip is, I'm wondering if you
could supply the quantity that I'll need.

1258
01:30:36.996 --> 01:30:40.363
- See, um...
- First the money...

1259
01:30:42.168 --> 01:30:45.331
then the honey.

1260
01:30:46.706 --> 01:30:50.107
All right, look.
You see my homey out there?

1261
01:30:53.579 --> 01:30:56.139
You got nine more grand.

1262
01:30:58.484 --> 01:31:00.918
Now show me yours.

1263
01:31:05.258 --> 01:31:07.249
<i>Get him a caja.</i>

1264
01:31:10.162 --> 01:31:13.689
- Okay.
- Make sure not to shake the baby food.

1265
01:31:19.405 --> 01:31:24.468
PCP is very explosive.

1266
01:31:25.878 --> 01:31:29.006
Boom!

1267
01:31:29.081 --> 01:31:31.845
I'd hate to lose
such a handsome customer.

1268
01:31:31.918 --> 01:31:34.148
Ooh, mami.

1269
01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:36.245
That feels good.

1270
01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.728
I might need it
for later.

1271
01:31:46.232 --> 01:31:51.465
<i>- So did you really make this stuff? You a chemist?
- </i>

1272
01:31:51.537 --> 01:31:56.406
<i>I worked in
a medical lab. Simon.</i>

1273
01:31:56.475 --> 01:32:00.775
Hey, baby... have you
ever had a threesome?

1274
01:32:00.846 --> 01:32:04.612
Hey, baby, let's take care
of the deal first, okay?

1275
01:32:04.684 --> 01:32:07.517
What's the matter?
Too much for you?

1276
01:32:07.586 --> 01:32:10.453
No, I just like business
before pleasure.

1277
01:32:12.425 --> 01:32:16.521
- He's a fucking cop!
- Rollie, get in here now!

1278
01:32:16.595 --> 01:32:21.055
Get him!

1279
01:32:21.133 --> 01:32:23.897
<i>You son-of-a-bitch!</i>

1280
01:32:25.705 --> 01:32:28.265
No!

1281
01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.912
<i> No!</i>

1282
01:32:36.983 --> 01:32:40.077
<i>- Ç Pinche perro!
- Aaah!</i>

1283
01:32:40.152 --> 01:32:42.848
<i>You killed my baby!
My baby!</i>

1284
01:32:42.922 --> 01:32:45.789
<i>-  It's PCP! Don't breathe!
-  Get this shit off me!</i>

1285
01:32:45.858 --> 01:32:48.725
Oh, shit! We gotta get you
to the hospital! No, no, no!

1286
01:32:48.794 --> 01:32:51.319
Get me a hose! We're gonna wash
this stuff off! Don't breathe!

1287
01:32:51.397 --> 01:32:54.059
<i>-
- It's a bust, ese.</i>

1288
01:32:54.133 --> 01:32:57.660
Goddamn it! We lost the fuckin' lab
and Clavo's money!

1289
01:32:57.737 --> 01:32:59.932
<i> That pinche
loan shark's gonna shit!</i>

1290
01:33:00.006 --> 01:33:02.668
<i>How we gonna
pay him back now?</i>

1291
01:33:02.742 --> 01:33:05.210
<i>- We lost everything.
- Ç Mira, mira! There's Carmen, eh.</i>

1292
01:33:05.277 --> 01:33:07.142
Come on, man,
turn around.

1293
01:33:07.213 --> 01:33:10.114
Who's that? Hey, she's
signalling someone, man!

1294
01:33:10.182 --> 01:33:12.616
<i> Paco, come back here!
We gotta wash that stuff off you!</i>

1295
01:33:12.685 --> 01:33:15.119
- Draw in the perimeter!
- Wilson, call it in!

1296
01:33:15.187 --> 01:33:17.621
Police!
Stop the car!

1297
01:33:17.690 --> 01:33:20.625
<i>Pull over
the fucking car!</i>

1298
01:33:21.994 --> 01:33:25.020
Stop the car!

1299
01:33:25.097 --> 01:33:27.292
<i>Put your hands on the steering wheel!
Get your hands up!</i>

1300
01:33:27.366 --> 01:33:28.799
Let's go.
Outta the car.

1301
01:33:28.868 --> 01:33:31.302
Careful, careful,
we're taxpayers, Officer McCann.

1302
01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:34.601
- You turn around.
- You two, outta the car!

1303
01:33:34.673 --> 01:33:37.335
<i>Orale, that's a nice placa
you got there, ese.</i>

1304
01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:39.878
<i>You should be riding with me,
not fucking with me, carnal.</i>

1305
01:33:39.945 --> 01:33:42.607
<i>Don't you call me carnal, you
piece of shit. I'm not your brother.</i>

1306
01:33:42.681 --> 01:33:45.241
<i> Scumbags like you
are killing off our kids.</i>

1307
01:33:45.317 --> 01:33:48.753
You should get some clothes on, officer,
before you get arrested for indecent exposure.

1308
01:33:48.821 --> 01:33:51.551
- What an example to set for the kids.
- Listen, motherfuckin' rat punk.

1309
01:33:51.624 --> 01:33:55.993
<i>I'm gonna put you and your rat clica
back in the joint. You keep talkin'!</i>

1310
01:33:56.062 --> 01:33:58.622
All right, all right,
Paco, let's go.

1311
01:33:58.697 --> 01:34:00.255
- Check the trunk.
- Put some clothes on.

1312
01:34:00.332 --> 01:34:03.096
- You got a warrant?
- Check that trunk!

1313
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:06.229
- What do you think you are, bulletproof? Check the trunk.
- Goddamn it, check it, Rollie.

1314
01:34:10.976 --> 01:34:13.342
<i> So? You think I never
seen an O.D. Before?</i>

1315
01:34:13.412 --> 01:34:16.313
What's the matter?
You don't recognize your own son?

1316
01:34:16.382 --> 01:34:18.350
Hey, fuck you.
That ain't Hector.

1317
01:34:18.417 --> 01:34:21.580
No, Hector's only 11.
That boy's 13.

1318
01:34:21.654 --> 01:34:27.251
If your boss Savedra keeps manufacturing
that shit, it'll put Hector in a cemetery too.

1319
01:34:27.326 --> 01:34:32.491
<i>¿Sabes que, homes? You may grow that
long hair and try to act like a vato,</i>

1320
01:34:32.565 --> 01:34:36.126
<i>-  but you still smell like chorizo, pig!
- This pig...</i>

1321
01:34:36.202 --> 01:34:38.136
is the only thing standing
between you and them,

1322
01:34:38.204 --> 01:34:40.035
but you ain't gonna
get through me, punk.

1323
01:34:40.106 --> 01:34:43.598
- Smokey, don't say nothing!
- Get him out of here, Rollie!

1324
01:34:46.445 --> 01:34:50.279
Your boss is a punk. He's gonna throw
you out with yesterday's coffee grounds.

1325
01:34:50.349 --> 01:34:55.150
<i>- I ain't no rata.
- Yeah, you're a rat.</i>

1326
01:34:55.221 --> 01:34:57.416
Get up! Go!

1327
01:34:57.490 --> 01:34:59.685
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1328
01:34:59.758 --> 01:35:02.693
<i>I believe my time here in this institution
has turned me completely around,</i>

1329
01:35:02.761 --> 01:35:04.752
<i>and I'm very grateful.</i>

1330
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:07.765
<i>Now I think I can make it as
a productive member of society.</i>

1331
01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:12.361
Mr. Velka, isn't it true
that you clique with La Onda,

1332
01:35:12.438 --> 01:35:15.271
a group whose motto is:
"Blood in, blood out,"

1333
01:35:15.341 --> 01:35:18.333
meaning you have to kill someone
in order to become a member?

1334
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:21.402
I hung out with a group who are
my friends from my old neighborhood.

1335
01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:26.349
Our reputation grew out of defense of each
other. That's a... That's it, nothing more.

1336
01:35:26.418 --> 01:35:29.854
<i> They didn't even listen!
They fucked me!</i>

1337
01:35:29.922 --> 01:35:33.653
Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Miklo,
and make something of your life.

1338
01:35:33.726 --> 01:35:36.752
<i>I don't ever wanna see you
in here again. ¿Me entiendes?</i>

1339
01:35:39.632 --> 01:35:41.725
This is my daughter.
Look at her.

1340
01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.464
Look at her! She was only
six months old when I came here.

1341
01:35:46.539 --> 01:35:49.167
She grew up without me.
I don't even know her.

1342
01:35:51.877 --> 01:35:56.337
<i>- That ain't right, carnal.
- No, it's not, but it's that way for too many of us.</i>

1343
01:35:56.415 --> 01:35:58.610
That's why your parole
is so important.

1344
01:35:58.684 --> 01:36:00.948
You've gotta prove
there's another way.

1345
01:36:03.656 --> 01:36:06.284
You got a chance
to do it, I don't.

1346
01:36:06.358 --> 01:36:08.349
<i>Right on, carnal.</i>

1347
01:36:08.427 --> 01:36:10.395
Right on.

1348
01:36:16.702 --> 01:36:18.567
Thank you.

1349
01:36:18.637 --> 01:36:21.868
<i> You gotta start acting like
somebody who deserves parole, carnal.</i>

1350
01:36:21.941 --> 01:36:25.433
<i>Put it on the record.
Earn your freedom on paper, ese.</i>

1351
01:36:25.511 --> 01:36:28.708
<i>All they got in front of them
is yourjacket.</i>

1352
01:36:28.781 --> 01:36:33.218
<i>You are yourjacket, 'cause to them,
you're just a number.</i>

1353
01:36:33.285 --> 01:36:37.085
<i>Everyone who enters the joint thinks he's
a man, but you know what he really is?</i>

1354
01:36:37.156 --> 01:36:40.182
<i>A number,
worth 30 grand a year.</i>

1355
01:36:40.259 --> 01:36:42.750
<i>They want us
to come back.</i>

1356
01:36:42.828 --> 01:36:45.661
<i>And what's worse, they have us
lining up to get in, ese.</i>

1357
01:36:45.731 --> 01:36:48.131
<i>We gotta turn
the system around.</i>

1358
01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.191
<i>We gotta
outthink them.</i>

1359
01:36:50.269 --> 01:36:54.296
<i>Now concentrate.
Why do you deserve parole, Mr. Velka?</i>

1360
01:36:54.373 --> 01:36:57.968
<i>Sir, I been in prison
almost a third of my life.</i>

1361
01:36:58.043 --> 01:37:01.103
I've grown up here. I've
learned to read and write here.

1362
01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:03.148
I earned my G.E.D.

1363
01:37:03.215 --> 01:37:07.276
Mr. Velka,
this board's only concern...

1364
01:37:07.353 --> 01:37:10.015
is to find evidence
of your rehabilitation.

1365
01:37:10.089 --> 01:37:12.319
<i>- That's all.
- Sir, with all due respect,</i>

1366
01:37:12.391 --> 01:37:14.325
look at my record.

1367
01:37:14.393 --> 01:37:18.227
I've worked hard to prove I deserve another
chance. It's in there in black and white.

1368
01:37:18.297 --> 01:37:21.095
Please give me
another chance.

1369
01:37:29.208 --> 01:37:33.702
<i>- ¿Que paso?
- I got it! I got my parole!</i>

1370
01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:44.048
- Magic!

1371
01:37:45.357 --> 01:37:47.382
They're gonna throw
a parade for me in Hollywood.

1372
01:37:47.459 --> 01:37:52.055
Hey, vato, the only parade they're
gonna throw for you is on Halloween.

1373
01:37:52.131 --> 01:37:54.964
<i></i>

1374
01:38:07.179 --> 01:38:09.511
<i></i>

1375
01:38:12.652 --> 01:38:15.519
<i>Ç Simon que si!</i>

1376
01:38:15.588 --> 01:38:17.488
Damn, ese, they're
not that good, homes.

1377
01:38:17.556 --> 01:38:20.650
That's the best thing I've
tasted in nine years, vato loco.

1378
01:38:20.726 --> 01:38:24.492
<i>
Orale.</i>

1379
01:38:24.563 --> 01:38:27.999
<i>- Good to be home, carnal.
- Right on, cacheton. Right on.</i>

1380
01:38:28.067 --> 01:38:30.535
<i>Cuidado, Cruzito.</i>

1381
01:38:30.603 --> 01:38:32.594
That rose won't bloom
in the spring.

1382
01:38:32.672 --> 01:38:35.835
Hey, hey, hey, hey. No
Baptist sermons, okay, homey?

1383
01:38:37.209 --> 01:38:39.439
Takes away the pain
in my back.

1384
01:38:39.512 --> 01:38:42.709
The Lord can't.
I tried praying.

1385
01:38:42.782 --> 01:38:46.809
- You better still be painting.
- You know it, homes. You know it.

1386
01:38:46.886 --> 01:38:49.081
But it's different
than before.

1387
01:38:50.423 --> 01:38:53.324
More real.

1388
01:39:04.537 --> 01:39:07.472
<i> No, hombre.
Famous apartments?</i>

1389
01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:09.508
They ain't famous
no more, ese.

1390
01:39:09.575 --> 01:39:11.907
<i>Orale, come stay with me, homes.
I got a studio.</i>

1391
01:39:11.977 --> 01:39:14.343
Nah, I gotta stay here.
Frank got me a place.

1392
01:39:14.413 --> 01:39:16.881
And besides, the parole board
checks my address.

1393
01:39:16.949 --> 01:39:20.112
<i>- Simon.
- Thanks, Cruzito.</i>

1394
01:39:20.186 --> 01:39:23.019
<i>Anytime, carnal,
tu sabes.</i>

1395
01:39:25.591 --> 01:39:27.559
You don't know how good
it is to see you, vato.

1396

1401
01:39:46.479 --> 01:39:50.279

1402
01:39:56.188 --> 01:39:58.588
<i>Entra.

Hey, homes.

1407
01:40:15.574 --> 01:40:18.702
Yeah, Carlos. Yeah, he told me
to tell your mom to send more coffee.

1408
01:40:18.778 --> 01:40:21.144
And make sure
it's, um, T.C.

1409
01:40:21.213 --> 01:40:23.443
Shit, she never
sent me nothin'.

1410
01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:31.654
Chata, some coffee!

1411
01:40:34.226 --> 01:40:37.354
Ay.
She's fucked up.

1412
01:40:37.429 --> 01:40:40.057
We had a party last night, ese.

1414

01:40:45.337 --> 01:40:47.931
<i> Uh...</i>

1416
01:40:50.276 --> 01:40:53.370
Hey, you know, that
didn't work out, homes.

This whole fuckin' building

So what am I gonna tell
my parole officer?

1419
01:40:58.818 --> 01:41:02.151

<i> You can stay here, ese.</i>

1422
01:41:07.693 --> 01:41:10.025
It's the same address.

1423
01:41:10.095 --> 01:41:13.553
- I even got you a good job.
- You're supposed to have an apartment for me!

1424
01:41:13.632 --> 01:41:16.032
Hey, just a fuckin' minute,
Your Majesty!

1425
01:41:16.101 --> 01:41:18.331
This ain't the joint
with three hots and a cot!

1426
01:41:18.404 --> 01:41:21.168
This is the streets, homey.
You got no choice!

1427
01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:25.176
<i>The parole board calls the shots here! This
is your address for at least three months!</i>

1428
01:41:33.886 --> 01:41:36.354
<i>Ç Chinga! La Onda
could do better than this!</i>

1429
01:41:36.422 --> 01:41:38.856
<i>Yeah, Rico and Luis
split after a month, man.</i>

1430
01:41:38.924 --> 01:41:41.791
I'm just hanging
for my old lady and my kid.

1431
01:41:41.861 --> 01:41:46.161
<i>- What about Popeye?
- Popeye's docking me for a third of my check, man.</i>

1432
01:41:46.232 --> 01:41:49.133
Everybody's getting clipped,
man, to pay that loan shark, Clavo.

1433
01:41:49.201 --> 01:41:51.669
<i>That's the dude that fronted the bread
for the PCPlab.</i>

1434
01:41:51.737 --> 01:41:53.705
That's not the way
it's supposed to be!

1435
01:41:53.772 --> 01:41:57.765

<i>Io mas romantico

1438
01:42:04.383 --> 01:42:06.613
- I burnt you on that one.
- Truck's loaded. Can I get my check?

1439
01:42:06.685 --> 01:42:08.949
No, Larry. No, no.
Don't be that way.

1440
01:42:09.021 --> 01:42:11.956
Larry, pettiness
is an ugly thing.

1441
01:42:12.024 --> 01:42:16.051
Won't be able to cash that 'til Monday.
Company'll do it for ten bucks.

1442
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:19.220
- All right.
- So, Larry,

1443
01:42:19.298 --> 01:42:22.199
what do you give me
on the Lakers and Golden State?

1444
01:42:22.268 --> 01:42:24.498
Three points?

1445
01:42:24.570 --> 01:42:27.130
Come on, Larry.
Kareem is crippled.

1446
01:42:27.206 --> 01:42:30.698
Gimme six points
and Golden State. Come on.

1447
01:42:30.776 --> 01:42:33.210
- What?

1448
01:42:33.279 --> 01:42:36.715
Barry's hand's hurt.
He's Golden State's whole offense.

1449
01:42:37.917 --> 01:42:40.909
Hang on, Larry.
So?

1450
01:42:40.986 --> 01:42:43.181
Kareem is injured.
So's Nixon.

1451
01:42:43.255 --> 01:42:46.486
Lakers got lots of firepower, but
without Barry, Golden State's nothin'.

1452
01:42:46.558 --> 01:42:48.617
<i>Six points
ain't enough.</i>

1453
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:56.163
Listen.
Six points or no bet.

1454
01:42:56.235 --> 01:42:58.226
Sorry, Larry.
Sorry, Larry.

1455
01:42:59.672 --> 01:43:04.405
All right.
Who made you the expert?

1456
01:43:04.476 --> 01:43:07.036
<i>Put me down
for 1,200.</i>

1457
01:43:07.112 --> 01:43:10.411
Yeah, 1,200, Larry.

1458
01:43:13.118 --> 01:43:15.348
<i> Chingao, East Los
has gotten really crowded.</i>

1459
01:43:15.421 --> 01:43:18.879
<i> It is, man. Illegals
pouring in from everywhere, homes.</i>

1460
01:43:18.958 --> 01:43:23.895
<i>Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Panama.
Donde sea, homes.</i>

1461
01:43:23.963 --> 01:43:27.524
Crossroads of the world, ese.
A Latino world.

1462
01:43:27.599 --> 01:43:29.965
<i>- Simon, ese.
- You seen Paco?</i>

1463
01:43:30.035 --> 01:43:32.196
- What?
- You seen Paco?

1464
01:43:32.271 --> 01:43:34.398
No, not since
Juanito died.

1465
01:43:34.473 --> 01:43:37.203
They don't wanna keep the wound
open, man. They don't want me around.

1466
01:43:37.276 --> 01:43:39.574
<i>That's cold-blooded,
carnal.</i>

1467
01:43:39.645 --> 01:43:43.308
Paco's a narc, homes.
Probably bust my ass someday.

1468
01:43:43.382 --> 01:43:45.714
Man, that's fucked up!

1469
01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:50.214
<i>-
- Detective Aguilar.</i>

1470
01:43:50.289 --> 01:43:53.816
Detective! Big time!

1471

<i>- ¿Qu'iubo, champ?
- Miklo?</i>

1472
01:43:56.762 --> 01:43:59.458
- Good guess.
- Oh, man, are you out?

1473
01:43:59.531 --> 01:44:02.557
- Yeah, two weeks.
- Well, why didn't you let me know, man?

1474
01:44:02.634 --> 01:44:06.229
Hey, after nine years in the joint,
it ain't easy to call a cop, ese.

1475
01:44:06.305 --> 01:44:10.901
Listen. It's not me I'm calling
about anyway. It's Cruz.

1476
01:44:10.976 --> 01:44:14.707
<i>He's hurtin', man.
He needs his familia.</i>

1477
01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:20.446
- He has no family.
- That ain't right, Paco. Vatos Locos forever, remember?

1478
01:44:20.519 --> 01:44:24.387
No, you know what I remember? The day they
lowered my little brother into the ground.

1479
01:44:24.456 --> 01:44:27.755
That changed me forever.

1480
01:44:27.826 --> 01:44:29.817
Every time I see a junkie
on the street...

1481
01:44:29.895 --> 01:44:32.523
it reminds me how Cruzito pissed
away his life and his talent.

1482
01:44:32.598 --> 01:44:36.591
- Yeah, well, think about it. I gotta get back to work.
- Hey, hey, carnal.

1483
01:44:36.668 --> 01:44:41.367
How you doing, man?
Anything I can do to help?

1484
01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:45.501
Nah. If I'm gonna make it outta here,
it's gonna be me who does it.

1485
01:44:45.577 --> 01:44:51.209
<i>And I really want to, carnal. There's lots
of chances to go the other way, believe me.</i>

1486
01:44:51.283 --> 01:44:57.153
<i>- But I'm gonna make it, Paco.
- Well, that's great, carnal. That's... That's great.</i>

1487
01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.327
I need the keys
to move the trucks.

1488
01:45:10.402 --> 01:45:14.839
Wait a minute. Make sure all the tires
are out of'em and they're washed down.

1489
01:45:16.708 --> 01:45:20.269
So you know your hoops.

1490

01:45:35.861 --> 01:45:39.763
<i>Hey, guero.

I gotta go to sleep.

Later, ese.

1498
01:45:53.378 --> 01:45:56.006
Get the fuck outta my bed! I gotta
go to work in the morning, man!

1499

<i>- What the fuck you on, ese?

1500
01:45:58.850 --> 01:46:02.115

- That's my space, man! That's all I have!

1501

<i>Aaah!
You pinche mamon!</i>

<i> Hey, Gil, there's been some
sorta mistake on my check.</i>

1503
01:46:17.135 --> 01:46:21.071
I'm $150 short. I worked 20 hours
overtime last week.

1504
01:46:21.139 --> 01:46:25.371
That's right. I'm gonna do you a favor
and take 150 out seven more times...

1505
01:46:25.444 --> 01:46:27.776
'til you pay back
the money you stole.

1506
01:46:27.846 --> 01:46:31.782
What? I been totally straight with
you, man. What are you talkin' about?

1507
01:46:33.285 --> 01:46:36.914
You know, I try
to give you cons a break.

1508
01:46:36.989 --> 01:46:39.651
You see money and you
can't resist stealing it.

1509
01:46:39.725 --> 01:46:42.785
That's a lie, man! I never stole
from you, Gil! It wasn't me!

1510
01:46:42.861 --> 01:46:45.625
You had the keys.
You knew where the money was.

1511
01:46:45.697 --> 01:46:48.427
What?

1512
01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:51.162
<i>I didn't...
I didn't do anything.</i>

1513
01:46:52.637 --> 01:46:54.628
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

1514
01:46:56.174 --> 01:46:59.302
150 times eight is 1,200.

1515
01:46:59.378 --> 01:47:01.505
<i>Right?</i>

1516
01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.912
Right?

1517
01:47:03.982 --> 01:47:08.180
You use my money to pay back
your gambling debts? Huh?

1518
01:47:08.253 --> 01:47:10.847
That's a cute story.

1519
01:47:10.922 --> 01:47:13.220
Tell you what.
I'm gonna call the cops.

1520
01:47:13.291 --> 01:47:17.955
I'll tell 'em my version, and
you can tell 'em yours, convict.

1521

<i>Hey. I'll get you
some extra overtime.</i>

Yeah, right.

So much for the straight world!
Fucker's got me by the balls!

1524
01:47:44.556 --> 01:47:47.218
He can call my parole officer
anytime and get me revoked.

<i>- You know, later on you'll get something better, tu sabes.
- Yeah, right.</i>

1527
01:47:52.998 --> 01:47:56.798
Maybe I can join the priesthood and get
some of that tax-free Sunday money, huh?

1528
01:47:56.868 --> 01:47:59.234
Ah, I was doin' better
than this in the joint.

1529
01:47:59.304 --> 01:48:01.829

- You told me you were fuckin' broke!

1556
01:49:37.903 --> 01:49:40.997
I don't come here to listen to you
chumps whine about nickels and dimes.

Anybody got

1560
01:49:48.947 --> 01:49:52.348
- Heh-heh, no, no. We got no problem with
that, ese. - Then what's the bullshit?

1561
01:49:53.418 --> 01:49:56.285
I'll do it.
We'll do it.

1562
01:49:56.355 --> 01:50:00.121
I got... I got Mudo out on the street
right now. He's coppin' some wheels.

<i>And, uh... and, uh,
we got the muscle.</i>

1564

You just give us the plan.

1565
01:50:05.631 --> 01:50:07.963
You got the muscle

Go ahead and make your move, motherfucker!
I'll send you to hell with Big Al!

Ah... I ain't got
no time to waste on you.

1571
01:50:29.254 --> 01:50:31.415
Wolf ticket's chump.

You're right, kid.

1573

01:50:43.068 --> 01:50:45.195
Hey, Clavo.
Hey, hey, wait a second.

1576
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:47.738
- What's the scam?

1577
01:50:47.806 --> 01:50:52.368
I need a triggerman, white boy,
not someone who just punches a clock.

1578
01:50:52.444 --> 01:50:54.878
<i>- You wanna see who I am? Huh?
- Ç Calmala!</i>

1579
01:50:54.947 --> 01:50:57.381
<i>- Ç Calmala, calmala!
- I don't give warning shots, cabron!</i>

1580
01:50:57.449 --> 01:50:59.849
We can do the money truck,
or we can off each other.

1581
01:51:02.421 --> 01:51:04.355
M- M-Miklo,
don't fuck around, ese.

1582
01:51:04.423 --> 01:51:07.415
Realthing.

1583
01:51:09.194 --> 01:51:11.219
<i>Miklo, this vato's big trouble!</i>

1584
01:51:11.296 --> 01:51:15.392
<i>- Ç Callate!
- You bluff in this game, gabacho, you better be holding five aces.</i>

1585
01:51:15.467 --> 01:51:18.265
In the joint, I was hustling more money
than that punk ever dreamed of.

1586
01:51:18.337 --> 01:51:20.805
He was punchin' my time clock
every day. What's the gig?

1587
01:51:20.872 --> 01:51:26.435
<i>- Ç Aguila! Ç Aguila!
- The armored truck at the Zody's Saturday night. Lotta cash.</i>

1588
01:51:26.511 --> 01:51:30.277
Popeye cleans his debt
and gets ten percent.

1589
01:51:30.349 --> 01:51:33.682
<i>Ç Chale! Armored truck's a dumb deal.
It's too dangerous.</i>

1590
01:51:35.354 --> 01:51:37.584
Not this one,
smart boy.

1591
01:51:37.656 --> 01:51:40.250
The driver's in on it.
He's a customer.

1592
01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:48.294
Okay, we'll do it.

1593
01:51:48.367 --> 01:51:52.167
But it's fifty-fifty, and
you wipe out Cruz's debt.

1594
01:51:52.237 --> 01:51:56.901
<i>Ç Chale, homes! Don't get fucked up in
this bullshit! Stay straight, pendejo!</i>

1595
01:51:56.975 --> 01:51:58.943
No sermons, ese,
remember?

1596
01:52:00.579 --> 01:52:02.604
This is who I am.

1597
01:52:04.616 --> 01:52:09.576
So, do we gift wrap this sucker for you,
or do you walk away empty-handed?

1598
01:52:11.089 --> 01:52:15.116
Sixty-forty. Realthing
handles the cash.

1599
01:52:15.193 --> 01:52:19.289
You come up with the guns and the car.
Apache's drivin'.

1600
01:52:19.364 --> 01:52:22.800
<i>Me and Smokes will
back up Realthing.</i>

1601
01:52:22.868 --> 01:52:27.134
- Okay. I can deal with that.
- You're gonna have to.

1602
01:52:27.205 --> 01:52:31.198
Hey, hey, hey!
What about me, fucker?

1603
01:52:31.276 --> 01:52:33.005
You're out of it,
asshole!

1604
01:52:33.078 --> 01:52:36.878
<i>It's payback time,
Popeye.</i>

1605
01:52:36.948 --> 01:52:40.315
I'm gonna take back
my rent money, with interest.

1606
01:52:43.321 --> 01:52:46.313
<i>Orale. Let's have
a drink, ese.</i>

1607
01:52:52.748 --> 01:52:56.479
Detective Aguilar?
Delivery from El Tepeyac?

1608
01:52:56.552 --> 01:52:58.486
- I got you, man. I got you.
- No way.

1609
01:52:58.554 --> 01:53:00.579
- Once... I did. I did so.
- No way, man. I knew it was you.

1610
01:53:00.656 --> 01:53:02.886
Check this out. Check this out.
"Manuel's Special."

1611
01:53:02.958 --> 01:53:05.324
Is this a nuclear accident
burrito or what?

1612
01:53:05.394 --> 01:53:09.831
- Something to tide us over 'til lunch.
- Us? You mean you. Two of you.

1613
01:53:09.898 --> 01:53:12.093
- Hey, I'm an undercover cop, all right?

1614
01:53:12.167 --> 01:53:15.159
- I'm working on my character look.
- You're a fat undercover cop.

1615
01:53:15.237 --> 01:53:18.729
<i>Does this look real or fake?
Real, right? McCann.</i>

1616
01:53:18.807 --> 01:53:22.800
<i>Oye, narco. You like
busting dope dealers?</i>

1617
01:53:22.878 --> 01:53:25.676
<i>Oye, pendejo.
This is my lunch hour.</i>

1618
01:53:25.748 --> 01:53:31.186
- Big deal going down tomorrow, the Zody's on Whittier.
- Who is this?

1619
01:53:31.253 --> 01:53:35.485
Look for a blue Econoline van
with 20 kis of coke inside.

1620
01:53:35.557 --> 01:53:37.923
You'll be on
the six o'clock news.

1621
01:53:37.993 --> 01:53:40.257
Oh, yeah.
Who is this?

1622
01:53:42.331 --> 01:53:44.265
<i> All I gotta say is,
shit goes down...</i>

1623
01:53:44.333 --> 01:53:47.268
<i>and we're sittin'here without backup,
we're gonna be two sorry assholes.</i>

1624
01:53:47.336 --> 01:53:50.032
<i> How many times we done this
and nothing's happened, huh?</i>

1625
01:53:50.105 --> 01:53:52.573
A lot. Relax.
H- Have a doughnut.

1626
01:53:52.641 --> 01:53:54.632
I already have one.

1627
01:53:54.710 --> 01:53:56.769
Have another doughnut.
Look at these.

1628
01:53:56.845 --> 01:53:59.109
What a dick.

1629
01:53:59.181 --> 01:54:01.115
Dick and asshole.
That's all you call me.

1630
01:54:01.183 --> 01:54:03.344
What is my name?
Dick Asshole?

1631
01:54:03.418 --> 01:54:05.511
<i> Hey, hey.
Blue Econoline van.</i>

1632
01:54:05.587 --> 01:54:07.418
<i>- Is that your guy?
- I don't know.</i>

1633
01:54:12.394 --> 01:54:16.387
- Do you see a connection anywhere?
- No.

1634
01:54:16.465 --> 01:54:19.127
<i> Looks like
two Latino males in front.</i>

1635
01:54:19.201 --> 01:54:21.135
<i>Some more in back.
I don't know how many.</i>

1636
01:54:21.203 --> 01:54:23.262
<i> That's a lot of people
for a dope deal.</i>

1637
01:54:23.338 --> 01:54:25.272
<i>Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.</i>

1638
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:28.434
<i>Shit! They're rippin'off the connection!
They're gonna take the money and the dope!</i>

1639
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:30.273
<i> No, there's
an armored truck!</i>

1640
01:54:30.345 --> 01:54:32.438
This ain't a buy.
This is a heist! Call it in!

1641
01:54:32.514 --> 01:54:35.881
- 211 in progress, Zody's on Whittier.
- Look up!

1642
01:54:35.951 --> 01:54:37.942
<i> Look up!</i>

1643
01:54:41.323 --> 01:54:43.587
Come on!

1644
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:57.771
<i> Smokey, I got you covered!
Let's go!</i>

1645
01:55:03.679 --> 01:55:06.147
Shit! Apache, cover me!

1646
01:55:08.717 --> 01:55:11.049
<i>- Apache, wait!

1647
01:55:11.987 --> 01:55:13.978
Shit!

1648
01:55:16.859 --> 01:55:19.919
They're headin' south on Whittier!
There's two of'em!

1649
01:55:19.995 --> 01:55:21.929
- Call it in!

1650
01:56:00.636 --> 01:56:05.198
<i>- It's me, carnal!

1651
01:56:06.575 --> 01:56:09.305
<i>- Gimme the gun, carnal.
- No fuckin' way, ese!</i>

1652
01:56:09.378 --> 01:56:11.676
Miklo, I can help you.
Gimme the fuckin' gun!

1653
01:56:11.747 --> 01:56:15.114
I ain't goin' back, Paco!
You owe me this one, vato loco!

1654
01:56:16.518 --> 01:56:19.510
No! Miklo, wait!
I can't!

1655
01:56:19.588 --> 01:56:22.022
- Stop! Police!
- Fuck you, detective!

1656
01:56:22.090 --> 01:56:24.285
Stop or I'll shoot!

When you gonna finish
messin' with that shit, homes?

1660
01:58:15.087 --> 01:58:20.115
<i>Huh? You painted it

Oh, shit, homes.

1664
01:58:30.936 --> 01:58:32.927
It's John Wayne.

1665
01:58:33.005 --> 01:58:37.339
<i> Uh, well, you're
just a bunch of little chavalas...</i>

So what you want, man?

01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:48.646
<i>Not much, carnalito.</i>

1669
01:58:48.721 --> 01:58:51.815
Uh, " Hey, how are you?
How you doin'?"

1670
01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:55.327
<i>- You know, things people usually say who care about each other.
- Oh, si.</i>

1671

After seven years
of nothing, man?

1672
01:58:59.398 --> 01:59:01.389
Not even
a fucking greeting card.

1673
01:59:01.467 --> 01:59:03.958
<i>You want hospitality, homes?
Hey, pues...</i>

1674

- Why don't you help yourself.
-  Hey, homes?

1677
01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:14.075
Did you say "Hey, homes" to Miklo,
homes, before you shot him?

1678
01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:17.582
- Hey, chill out, Chuey!
- He was a shooter in a robbery. I was doing my job.

1679
01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:19.880
<i>Nobody has the right
to kill innocent people.</i>

Hey, homes, you can't come here anymore
unless you're gonna bust me!

1685
01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:40.834
Who the fuck gave you permission to use
my little brother in your paintings?

1686
01:59:40.906 --> 01:59:43.500
<i>I don't need permission from you.
He's my carnalito too!</i>

1687
01:59:43.576 --> 01:59:48.104
Don't you useJuanito as an excuse to
wreck your life. You don't have that right!

01:59:51.450 --> 01:59:53.441
<i>Si, culero.</i>

Fuckin' right I don't.

Take it, man!
Come on!

1695
02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:14.364
Juanito always loved me
more than you, homes.

1696

<i>Ç Tu te creias muy chingon! You were always
too much of a badass to love the little vato!</i>

Just like you are now. So much of a
fucking badass you kill your own people!

1698
02:00:22.815 --> 02:00:25.477
No!

1699
02:00:25.551 --> 02:00:28.782
Don't you ever say that to me again,
Cruzito. I let you say that once...

1700
02:00:28.854 --> 02:00:30.879
<i>¿Que, puto?
What the fuck?</i>

1701
02:00:30.956 --> 02:00:34.756
<i>You gonna kick my ass?
Well, ç caiga! Let's get down.</i>

1702
02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:38.729
- Come on! You the badass!
- I don't wanna fight with you, little brother.

1703
02:00:38.797 --> 02:00:43.325
<i>To what, bust me? Well, come on,
gabacho. You the law. Do your job.</i>

1704
02:00:45.004 --> 02:00:47.165
Do your fucking job!

1705
02:01:16.769 --> 02:01:19.329
Look at this.

1706
02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:21.373
Look at that.

1707
02:01:22.374 --> 02:01:24.501
Must be
from Quentin, huh?

1708
02:01:26.845 --> 02:01:30.804
- Hey. Hey, he's the guy...
- PCP bust. That's Popeye Savedra.

1709
02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:33.545
Miklo's connected to him.

1710
02:01:33.619 --> 02:01:36.281
<i>"La Onda a toda madre
o un desmadre. "</i>

1711
02:01:36.355 --> 02:01:38.346
<i>What's "Onda"?</i>

1712
02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:40.619
<i>No, La Onda.
It's your destiny, man.</i>

1713
02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:43.287
It's... It's like a wave
nothing can stop.

1714
02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:45.330
Uh, "madre" means mother.
So...

1715
02:01:45.397 --> 02:01:47.388
No, no, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1716
02:01:47.466 --> 02:01:50.299
<i>This is some heavy shit,
all right? "A toda madre".</i>

1717
02:01:50.369 --> 02:01:52.667
<i>Everything is perfect.
It's like...</i>

1718
02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:54.763
your mother's love.

1719
02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:56.808
<i>And "un desmadre"...</i>

1720
02:01:58.244 --> 02:02:00.371
is like you have no mother.

1721
02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.641
It's absolute hatred.
Complete destruction.

1722
02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:05.616
<i>In other words, you win it all
or lose everything.</i>

1723
02:02:05.684 --> 02:02:08.152
Sweet bunch of guys.

1724
02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:12.054
This big fat pig, Popeye, right here in
the center? He's gotta be their leader.

1725
02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:15.252
<i>- Hey, Aguilar?
- Look at the way they're all grouped around him.</i>

1726
02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:19.991
Hey, Aguilar, that con you
blasted just got outta surgery.

1727
02:02:20.065 --> 02:02:23.034
He's gonna be a whole lot
easier to catch from now on.

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:39.884
<i>Nurse, could you
give me a minute, please?</i>

1729
02:02:39.952 --> 02:02:41.920
Nurse?

1730
02:02:48.493 --> 02:02:51.860
<i>Por la Virgen, Miklo,
I did not know that it would...</i>

1731
02:02:51.930 --> 02:02:55.730
<i>Don't talk to me about the Virgen.
Vatos Locos forever.</i>

1732
02:02:55.801 --> 02:02:58.998
That all died when you
pulled the trigger.

1733
02:03:07.179 --> 02:03:10.205
How did everything
get so fucked up, man?

1734
02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:12.546
<i>The pinche badge, ese.</i>

1735
02:03:14.419 --> 02:03:16.910
<i>You owe me, vendido!</i>

1736
02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:20.417
Who's the sellout?

1737
02:03:20.492 --> 02:03:22.619
You're tellin' me you're
workin' hard, goin' straight.

1738
02:03:22.694 --> 02:03:24.855
The next thing I know,
you're pointin' a.357 at me...

1739
02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:27.660
and there's two guys
dead on the ground.

1740
02:03:27.733 --> 02:03:31.260
I would have given you
anything, Miklo.

1741
02:03:31.336 --> 02:03:34.601
But you can't just
take away what I am.

1742
02:03:36.375 --> 02:03:39.139
You chose
the wrong side, ese.

1743
02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:42.271
There's too many of us.
You're gonna lose.

1744
02:03:42.347 --> 02:03:45.578
No, uh-uh. I don't forget
where I come from or who I am.

1745
02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:48.084
That's what keeps me goin'
every day.

1746
02:03:49.588 --> 02:03:53.615
- You don't wanna hear the truth, Paco.
- What truth?

1747
02:03:53.692 --> 02:03:56.217
This? La Onda.
Is this your truth?

1748
02:03:56.294 --> 02:03:59.457
<i>Two-bit punks like Popeye Savedra
with their PCPlabs?</i>

1749
02:03:59.531 --> 02:04:03.831
Or you, robbing Zody's
and killing innocent people?

1750
02:04:03.902 --> 02:04:05.995
If that's your truth, then you're
right. I don't wanna hear it.

1751
02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:09.234
<i>Get out, puto!
You're not my blood!</i>

1752
02:04:10.575 --> 02:04:13.043
I'm cutting you off
like they did my leg.

1753
02:04:15.213 --> 02:04:17.613
You don't exist
for me anymore.

1754
02:04:33.632 --> 02:04:37.329
<i> Miklo!
Orale, carnalito. What's up, ese?</i>

1755
02:04:37.402 --> 02:04:39.336
<i>You're looking good,
homey.</i>

1756
02:04:47.145 --> 02:04:52.583
<i></i>

1757
02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:54.812
<i>-
- Hey, Hopalong!</i>

1758
02:04:54.886 --> 02:04:58.481
You better tell Carlos he better
stop fucking with my business!

1759
02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:00.821
Pockets,
not in public!

1760
02:05:00.892 --> 02:05:03.588
<i> I ain't gonna let
no junkie rip-off my customers!</i>

1761
02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:05.596
<i> Velka, time to lock up!</i>

1762
02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:08.428
<i>Mira, mira.
It's the Bionic Man.</i>

1763
02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.434
<i> Hey, Carlos,
what's with the B.G.A.?</i>

1764
02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:13.232
Pay no mind to cheap conversation.
They're just sore losers, ese.

1765
02:05:13.305 --> 02:05:16.934
- They're just flapping their crow wings.
- Pockets is on the warpath.

1766
02:05:17.008 --> 02:05:20.375
I can't help it if the customers
know where the quality is.

1767
02:05:20.445 --> 02:05:22.379
He's been selling 'em
baby powder.

1768
02:05:22.447 --> 02:05:25.245
I don't have all day, man.
Let's take it in.

1769
02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:28.252
Hey, Majito.
Gonna be cellies, huh?

1770
02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.811
<i>- Orale.
-  Move over here. Let me get these cuffs.</i>

1771
02:05:32.624 --> 02:05:35.559
<i>Ç Orale! That's
a badass pano, homeboy.</i>

1772
02:05:35.627 --> 02:05:37.686
You been burnin'
them quills, huh?

1773
02:05:37.762 --> 02:05:40.754
- You're getting good.
- It's yours.

1774
02:05:44.102 --> 02:05:46.263
My "Home Sweet Home"
picture, huh?

1775
02:05:47.439 --> 02:05:49.532
At least this bum leg
got me something.

1776
02:05:49.608 --> 02:05:52.168
I get to work
at the law library.

1777
02:05:52.244 --> 02:05:55.543
What's all that mad-dogging
between Carlos and the B.G.A.?

1778
02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:58.412
The vato's got one
sweet cocaine connection.

1779
02:05:58.483 --> 02:06:01.919
Hmm. And he's moving in
on Pockets' customers.

1780
02:06:01.987 --> 02:06:04.421
How did he connect?

1781
02:06:04.489 --> 02:06:08.482
Nobody knows. But it's dynamite shit.
Pure Bolivian flake.

1782
02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.994
And Montana, he just stood by
and watched Carlos jump in?

1783
02:06:11.062 --> 02:06:13.690
<i>Plata talks.</i>

1784
02:06:13.765 --> 02:06:16.256
Carlos is recruiting
lots of soldiers...

1785
02:06:16.334 --> 02:06:19.826
and buying influence on the council
to try to neutralize Montana.

1786
02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:22.339
Says it's his own personal trip,
not Onda's!

1787
02:06:22.407 --> 02:06:26.468
That's bullshit! Personal trips
is what's fucking Onda up!

1788
02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:28.809
I saw that out on the streets.

1789
02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:31.610
We're cutting
our own throats.

1790
02:06:36.054 --> 02:06:38.147
<i>It's too soon
to be walking on it.</i>

1791
02:06:38.223 --> 02:06:40.191
It's a long way up.

1792
02:06:40.258 --> 02:06:43.921
But there's no way they're gonna stick
me down there on the first tier without...

1793
02:06:43.995 --> 02:06:46.190
<i>ah, my carnales.</i>

1794
02:06:46.264 --> 02:06:48.323
Ah!

1795
02:06:49.768 --> 02:06:51.702
Your own cousin did that.

1796
02:06:53.838 --> 02:06:56.398
<i>- We should put a hit on that puto.
- No, he's mine.</i>

1797
02:06:56.474 --> 02:06:59.602
His payback's
gonna take time.

1798
02:06:59.678 --> 02:07:03.876
I'm gonna make him sorry
he ever fucked with my business.

1799
02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:05.940
<i>Hey, puto.</i>

1800
02:07:06.017 --> 02:07:07.985
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, chorizo?

1801
02:07:08.053 --> 02:07:10.044
Trying to jump-start
your memory, punk.

1802
02:07:10.121 --> 02:07:12.749
Turn your ass around.
Where the fuck is Popeye Savedra?

1803
02:07:12.824 --> 02:07:14.792
I ain't seen the vato.
He took off.

1804
02:07:14.859 --> 02:07:16.827
Yeah? Right after
Zody's, right?

1805
02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:19.227
You were in on that too,
weren't you, Smokey?

1806
02:07:19.297 --> 02:07:23.529
<i>- How 'bout these putos? You know 'em, don't you?
- No. No way.</i>

1807
02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:27.333
La Onda? Isn't that what
that snake tattoo means?

1808
02:07:27.405 --> 02:07:29.396
Isn't that what
that snake tattoo means?

1809
02:07:29.474 --> 02:07:31.704
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about, ese.

1810
02:07:31.776 --> 02:07:33.903
<i>I'll tell you what
I'm talking about, pendejo.</i>

1811
02:07:33.979 --> 02:07:36.971
You're a two-time loser, Smokey. One
more, they're gonna lock you up for good.

1812
02:07:37.048 --> 02:07:39.778
So you better tell me about Onda, or
I'm gonna strap you down with a bitch.

1813
02:07:39.851 --> 02:07:41.978
You'll never see
the streets again!

1814
02:07:42.053 --> 02:07:46.456
If I say anything, I'm dead meat.
I ain't gonna tell you shit, ese!

1815
02:07:57.135 --> 02:08:00.832
<i>It's baby powder, baboso!</i>

1816
02:08:00.905 --> 02:08:02.964
You write down
every word I say.

1817
02:08:03.041 --> 02:08:07.808
Anything you don't understand, you ask.
I will answer just once, so write it down.

1818
02:08:07.879 --> 02:08:11.679
Precedents for habeas corpus,
cruel and unusual punishment here.

1819
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:14.184
You're also allowed to help
on Durham decree.

1820
02:08:14.252 --> 02:08:16.413
How much can you
charge for this?

1821
02:08:16.488 --> 02:08:19.013
You gotta know what you're
talkin' about first.

1822
02:08:19.090 --> 02:08:21.524
You do your homework,
jailhouse lawyer...

1823
02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:24.653
can make as much as
any mid-level attorney on the street.

1824
02:08:24.729 --> 02:08:26.856
I'm gonna live
in here.

1825
02:08:28.266 --> 02:08:32.202
- Jerry, I don't mean to be nosy, but l...
- Then don't be.

1826
02:08:34.306 --> 02:08:37.036
All right, what?
What is it?

1827
02:08:37.108 --> 02:08:39.702
I'm just
wonderin', uh...

1828
02:08:39.778 --> 02:08:42.212
You own all those
hardware stores.

1829
02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:44.646
How come
you're in here?

1830
02:08:46.017 --> 02:08:49.077
Eleven tons of Colombian weed,
twelve keys of heroin...

1831
02:08:49.154 --> 02:08:51.952
and a pilot that turned
state's evidence.

1832
02:08:52.991 --> 02:08:57.018
<i>Ç Chingao! Big time.</i>

1833
02:08:57.095 --> 02:08:59.757
- Hey, Jer, I just want you to handle my ca...
- Hurry up, Jerry.

1834
02:08:59.831 --> 02:09:02.732
Charlie. I didn't see your jacket here.
You got an appointment?

1835
02:09:02.801 --> 02:09:05.326
<i>The name's Carlos. Remember, I'm
paying you lot of feria, ese.</i>

1836
02:09:05.403 --> 02:09:07.894
- Make an appointment, Charlie.
- You should be working on my case overtime.

1837
02:09:07.972 --> 02:09:11.430
Charlie, cool out or get out.
George? Table.

1838
02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:19.513
<i>Oye, Miklo. You could take your leg off and
hook down some of the books from up top, ese.</i>

1839
02:09:19.584 --> 02:09:24.578
<i>Hey, I'm just kidding, ese.
Come here. Oye, come here, man.</i>

1840
02:09:24.656 --> 02:09:29.286
<i>Hey, relax. I got the medicine
to make you well, vato. Mira.</i>

1841
02:09:29.361 --> 02:09:32.922
<i>If you're ever in any pain, homey, you
just come talk to me. ¿Me entiendes?</i>

1842
02:09:35.066 --> 02:09:37.034
<i>- You should talk to El Mero Mero.
- Chale.</i>

1843
02:09:37.102 --> 02:09:40.594
Think about the future, not the past.
Montana's not God.

1844
02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:44.605
<i> Tomorrow at the council I'm giving
Onda a chance to move into the driver's seat.</i>

1845
02:09:44.675 --> 02:09:46.802
<i>Don't be
left behind, eh?</i>

1846
02:09:46.877 --> 02:09:50.711
<i>Mira. I cut a sweet deal
with the AV-ers.</i>

1847
02:09:50.781 --> 02:09:53.579
<i>They'll supply me
with all the dope I can move...</i>

1848
02:09:53.651 --> 02:09:56.484
just as long as I sell
only to the blacks and the browns.

1849
02:09:57.855 --> 02:10:02.087
What do you have to give
in return to the polar bears?

1850
02:10:03.827 --> 02:10:06.455
I gotta plug up
the B.G.A. Pipeline.

1851
02:10:06.530 --> 02:10:08.464
Take 'em outta
the dope business.

1852
02:10:11.168 --> 02:10:15.628
<i>It's simple. Me and my soldados
can take care of Pockets in here.</i>

1853
02:10:15.706 --> 02:10:19.164
<i>My brother Smokey can take out Cheap
Times, their main supply joint in L.A.</i>

1854
02:10:19.243 --> 02:10:22.269
All I need from the council
is backup.

1855
02:10:22.346 --> 02:10:27.545
- In return, I'm prepared to give Onda a third of my profit.
- It's a sucker's deal, ese.

1856
02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:33.652
The only thing the Aryans want is
to start a war between black and brown.

1857
02:10:33.724 --> 02:10:35.715
<i>Chale. We've got
a truce with the B.G.A.</i>

1858
02:10:35.793 --> 02:10:39.092
<i>Why do you wanna play
the chimp with these mayates?</i>

1859
02:10:39.163 --> 02:10:41.631
The market is there.

1860
02:10:41.699 --> 02:10:44.862
Cocaine is America's
cup of coffee.

1861
02:10:47.304 --> 02:10:49.864
<i>Oye, check it out.</i>

1862
02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:51.874
<i>I'm making so much feria
right now,</i>

1863
02:10:51.942 --> 02:10:55.105
it's making Miklo's gambling book
look like bubble gum change!

1864
02:10:55.179 --> 02:10:58.376
We don't start wars
to become dope pushers.

1865
02:10:58.449 --> 02:11:01.145
<i>You even addicted some of
our own soldados to coca.</i>

1866
02:11:01.218 --> 02:11:05.712
We're supposed to protect
our people, not destroy them.

1867
02:11:05.789 --> 02:11:09.316
Look at his arms. He loves
that shit more than he loves us.

1868
02:11:09.393 --> 02:11:12.954
<i>- He'll destroy La Onda.
- Ç Ya! Enough words.</i>

1869
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:17.126
We've come all this way. You wanna
go back to bumming cigarettes, ese?

1870
02:11:17.201 --> 02:11:20.659
<i>- Oye, you wanna shine shoes?
- Ese, La Onda don't shine shoes.</i>

1871
02:11:20.738 --> 02:11:23.730
That's right, but that's what's gonna
happen if we don't make our move now.

1872
02:11:23.807 --> 02:11:27.368
I wanna own the whole fuckin' store!
Now are you with me?

1873
02:11:27.444 --> 02:11:30.572
<i>I say chale.
You're not the leader here.</i>

1874
02:11:30.648 --> 02:11:32.548
<i>I say Onda's
not with you.</i>

1875
02:11:32.616 --> 02:11:34.709
You do what you
have to do without us.

1876
02:11:44.628 --> 02:11:47.563
'Cause I ain't goin' back.

1877
02:11:49.233 --> 02:11:51.531
I don't need Onda for this.

1878
02:11:51.602 --> 02:11:55.003
Money buys my backup.

1879
02:11:55.072 --> 02:11:58.132
I'll get the polar bears
to back my play.

1880
02:12:01.145 --> 02:12:03.238
<i>- Oye, ¿adonde vas, Jose?
- I split, eh.</i>

1881
02:12:03.313 --> 02:12:05.406
<i>- Hey, carnal.
- No, ese.</i>

1882
02:12:09.386 --> 02:12:13.345
<i>Carlos, come back!
Jefe, we can't let him go.</i>

1883
02:12:13.424 --> 02:12:16.120
We can't let him
split up Onda. Carlos!

1884
02:12:16.193 --> 02:12:19.560
<i> Can't you see Montana's
stupid for letting Charlie walk?</i>

1885
02:12:19.630 --> 02:12:21.655
<i>- Onda's committing suicide.
- Fuck you, Jerry!</i>

1886
02:12:21.732 --> 02:12:23.859
Fine. I thought you wanted
to learn something.

1887
02:12:27.071 --> 02:12:29.005
Listen, Charlie's
a businessman.

1888
02:12:29.073 --> 02:12:31.007
He broke some serious
business rules.

1889
02:12:31.075 --> 02:12:33.305
Not only did he get strung out
on his own shit,

1890
02:12:33.377 --> 02:12:36.107
but he moved on B.G.A. Clients
when he didn't have to.

1891
02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:38.114
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

1892
02:12:38.182 --> 02:12:40.946
I see the jackets of most
of the cons that come in here.

1893
02:12:41.018 --> 02:12:43.919
Eighty percent of them...
eighty percent of them are drug cases.

1894
02:12:43.987 --> 02:12:46.512
You know why?
Because everybody out there's doin' it.

1895
02:12:46.590 --> 02:12:48.649
Doctors, lawyers,
housewives.

1896
02:12:48.726 --> 02:12:51.160
Cocaine is
America's cup of coffee.

1897
02:12:55.466 --> 02:12:57.730
You were Carlos' connection.

1898
02:12:57.801 --> 02:13:02.602
<i>He said the same "cup of coffee"line
exactly. You were supplying him.</i>

1899
02:13:02.673 --> 02:13:05.665
<i>You're pissed 'cause he's
doing business with AV-ers now.</i>

1900
02:13:05.743 --> 02:13:09.201
Last year, California passed
a flat-time law for drug offenders.

1901
02:13:09.279 --> 02:13:11.804
You know what that means? That means
they have it worse than anybody...

1902
02:13:11.882 --> 02:13:13.873
murderers, rapists,
anybody.

1903
02:13:13.951 --> 02:13:16.249
There's no parole,
no good time.

1904
02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:20.450
That's a lot of guys that are gonna be
here for a real long time, all drug users.

1905
02:13:20.524 --> 02:13:22.458
Can you see
the potential?

1906
02:13:22.526 --> 02:13:24.517
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1907
02:13:24.595 --> 02:13:26.654
Anyone who can accommodate
that appetite...

1908
02:13:26.730 --> 02:13:30.188
can control this joint
and every other joint.

1909
02:13:30.267 --> 02:13:32.167
Dwell on it.

1910
02:13:39.443 --> 02:13:42.276
Drive it.
Drive it, Ryder.

1911
02:13:42.346 --> 02:13:44.678
Here's your pill briefs.

1912
02:13:44.748 --> 02:13:48.275
Jerry said it will take at least
three months for the court to respond.

1913
02:13:48.352 --> 02:13:50.877
Well, well, well,
Lightning.

1914
02:13:50.954 --> 02:13:54.014
<i>Our favorite spic lover has come home.
I knew he'd be back.</i>

1915
02:13:54.091 --> 02:13:59.859
Here's your file. Magic said to remind you
about Lightning's account. It's overdue.

1916
02:13:59.930 --> 02:14:04.526
You hear that, Lightning? The cripple
here wants to collect your gambling debts.

1917
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:09.933
Yeah, well, I might think about it,
if he'll show me his falsie.

1918
02:14:11.275 --> 02:14:13.038
Come on, cripple,
show me your stump.

1919
02:14:13.110 --> 02:14:15.544
<i> Little white Mexican boy...</i>

1920
02:14:15.612 --> 02:14:17.637
came all the way back
just to show us his stump.

1921
02:14:17.714 --> 02:14:21.206
- Hold his fuckin' leg! Come on. Stand still.
- Get off me, motherfuckers!

1922
02:14:21.285 --> 02:14:24.186
Too many britches on.
Stay still, goddamn it, I said!

1923
02:14:24.254 --> 02:14:26.484
You gotta be crazy to pull
this shit, Lightning!

1924
02:14:26.557 --> 02:14:28.491
Ooh, I'm scared, punk.

1925
02:14:28.559 --> 02:14:31.392
<i>I'll bet you didn't fight so hard when
Big Al used to do this, did you?</i>

1926
02:14:31.461 --> 02:14:33.326
He must be laughin'
in his grave, cripple.

1927
02:14:33.397 --> 02:14:35.991
Get off, you fuck...
No, leave it alone!

1928
02:14:36.066 --> 02:14:38.899
Stay still,
goddamn it.

1929
02:14:38.969 --> 02:14:43.429
<i>- Oh! There she is.
- Fucking puto!</i>

1930
02:14:43.507 --> 02:14:47.136
You ever heard that old saying,
"Put your foot in your mouth"?

1931
02:14:49.079 --> 02:14:51.741
Spit-shine that shoe, boy.

1932
02:14:53.851 --> 02:14:57.844
- You fuckin' polar bears are gonna pay, believe me!

1933
02:14:57.921 --> 02:15:01.516
Look around you, half-breed.
Onda's finished!

1934
02:15:01.592 --> 02:15:03.526
Carlos works for us now,

1935
02:15:03.594 --> 02:15:06.188
and every day he brings
more Onda soldiers with him.

1936
02:15:06.263 --> 02:15:09.460
You greasers better wise up.
It's a white world.

1937
02:15:09.533 --> 02:15:12.195
<i>The coloreds are here
to serve us.</i>

1938
02:15:12.269 --> 02:15:16.035
From now on, you're gonna be
my personal errand boy.

1939
02:15:17.474 --> 02:15:20.466
- You motherfucker!
- Fuckin' punk!

1940
02:15:20.544 --> 02:15:24.036
Go out for a pass, cripple.
Come on, go deep.

1941
02:15:32.689 --> 02:15:35.021
Now you're back to
your true nature, boy.

1942
02:15:35.092 --> 02:15:38.789
<i>- Crawling on your belly like a worm.
- </i>

1943
02:15:40.097 --> 02:15:42.031
They put it in my face!

1944
02:15:42.099 --> 02:15:46.001
You have to understand. Your leg is gone,
Miklo. You can no longer be a soldier.

1945
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:48.003
That's why I put you
in the library.

1946
02:15:48.071 --> 02:15:51.097
It's not what they did to me.
They got no respect for Onda.

1947
02:15:51.174 --> 02:15:53.165
We should never have
given up Carlos.

1948
02:15:53.243 --> 02:15:57.543
You think I wanted to?
Carlos fucked up, bad!

1949
02:15:57.614 --> 02:16:00.481
I'm not saying he didn't,
but he was right about the drugs.

1950
02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:02.518
Whoever controls them
controls everything.

1951
02:16:02.586 --> 02:16:05.521
You ever seen an old drug dealer,
Miklo? They don't exist.

1952
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:07.853
Look, all we have
to do is wait.

1953
02:16:07.924 --> 02:16:11.360
<i>In five years, Chicanos are gonna be the
majority in the pintas in the Southwest.</i>

1954
02:16:11.428 --> 02:16:13.555
This is now,
not five years from now!

1955
02:16:13.630 --> 02:16:17.589
What good is it if we're a bunch of fuckin'
slaves workin' for the B.G.A. And AV-ers?

1956
02:16:17.667 --> 02:16:19.692
We gotta attack now!
We gotta take power!

1957
02:16:19.770 --> 02:16:22.466
All we ever been doing is fighting
each other! And for what?

1958
02:16:22.539 --> 02:16:24.530
The best of us ending up
in pools of blood...

1959
02:16:24.608 --> 02:16:26.906
<i>for a pinche pack of smokes
and a snort of coca!</i>

1960
02:16:26.977 --> 02:16:29.377
<i>Ç Chale!</i>

1961
02:16:29.446 --> 02:16:32.381
I don't know where
you're comin' from, bro.

1962
02:16:37.754 --> 02:16:39.813
<i>¿Que es eso?</i>

1963
02:16:41.491 --> 02:16:46.690
A Chicana from Cal State got them
to publish my essay on prison reform.

1964
02:16:48.231 --> 02:16:52.190
They want me to write a book
on the Chicano in prison.

1965
02:16:55.806 --> 02:16:58.741
<i>You better lift your eyes
outta this book, Jefe.</i>

1966
02:16:58.809 --> 02:17:01.539
You better see what's
goin' on around us now.

1967
02:17:07.384 --> 02:17:11.844
<i>Wind it up, gentlemen. Take it
to your houses. Let's go, move it.</i>

1968
02:17:11.922 --> 02:17:14.015
<i> Hey, Bonafide! When's
the B.G.A. Gonna take care of its tab?</i>

1969
02:17:14.090 --> 02:17:16.251
<i>No can do, carnal.</i>

1970
02:17:18.528 --> 02:17:20.496
Quarter of the bill
I can take care of, maybe.

1971
02:17:20.564 --> 02:17:22.862
<i>Indugu. You forgot
your comb, man.</i>

1972
02:17:24.467 --> 02:17:26.492
Maybe.

1973
02:17:28.238 --> 02:17:31.071
Thinks he's getting away with something.
He's holding on to a fairy tale.

1974
02:17:31.141 --> 02:17:34.235
<i>- Ç Pinche mayate!
- Hey, Magic.</i>

1975
02:17:34.311 --> 02:17:36.279
<i>Help me out.</i>

1976
02:17:36.346 --> 02:17:41.113
<i></i>

1977
02:17:49.392 --> 02:17:51.883
<i> You mad-dog me,
you better watch your back, homes!</i>

1978
02:17:51.962 --> 02:17:55.193
Now the fuckin' AV-ers
won't pay on their bets either.

1979
02:17:55.265 --> 02:17:59.258
Why pay? They were testing us
with Carlos and we folded.

1980
02:17:59.336 --> 02:18:01.361
Now they're gonna take us
apart piece by piece.

1981
02:18:06.409 --> 02:18:09.742
Whether we like it or not, the dope
business is where it's at, Magic.

1982
02:18:09.813 --> 02:18:14.750
If the AV-ers and the BGA-ers control
it, they control everything, including us.

1983
02:18:14.818 --> 02:18:17.582
Fuckin' A, ese.
Carlitos was right.

1984
02:18:17.654 --> 02:18:20.851
No, he was stupid...
for sellin' out to the AV-ers.

1985
02:18:24.794 --> 02:18:28.730
Onda should take the money left
in the gambling book and make a buy.

1986
02:18:28.798 --> 02:18:30.732
Yeah.

1987
02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:33.064
I know a connection.

1988
02:18:33.136 --> 02:18:38.904
- But the council won't approve it.
- We should do it anyway.

1989
02:18:42.412 --> 02:18:45.745
- You wanna die, ese?
- If I have to, I will!

1990
02:18:47.350 --> 02:18:50.842
I lost my fucking leg,
my family back home.

1991
02:18:50.921 --> 02:18:52.889
This is all I got left.

1992
02:18:52.956 --> 02:18:56.824
If we don't do something now,
Onda dies. Do you want that?

1993
02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:07.331
Magic.
I love Montana too.

1994
02:19:07.404 --> 02:19:10.703
But I'm not gonna stand by
and watch them destroy us.

1995
02:19:15.645 --> 02:19:17.579
<i>Will you stand with me,
carnal?</i>

1996
02:19:31.495 --> 02:19:33.486
<i> Right now there's
only two of us,</i>

1997
02:19:33.563 --> 02:19:35.588
<i>so we gotta lay back
and wait for an opening.</i>

1998
02:19:35.666 --> 02:19:40.797
<i>The Aryan Vanguard's gonna force Carlos
to make his move soon on the B.G.A.</i>

1999
02:19:40.871 --> 02:19:42.839
<i>His first target
will be Pockets.</i>

2000
02:19:42.906 --> 02:19:46.171
I told you to stop
branchin', punk!

2001
02:19:47.778 --> 02:19:50.611
Better watch your back
'cause I'm gonna ride you.

2002
02:19:50.681 --> 02:19:54.811
<i>Orale, ese. You're right.
I don't want any trouble.</i>

2003
02:19:54.885 --> 02:19:57.979
I've changed my ways.

2004
02:20:03.794 --> 02:20:06.661
Now I'm takin'
all your customers.

2005
02:20:08.265 --> 02:20:10.961
Say anything
and you're dead!

2006
02:20:11.034 --> 02:20:13.628
<i> At the same time
he hits Pockets,</i>

2007
02:20:13.704 --> 02:20:19.040
<i>his brother Smokey will move on Cheap
Times, the B.G.A. 's drugstore down in L.A.</i>

2008
02:20:20.610 --> 02:20:22.441
<i>*Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

2009
02:20:25.882 --> 02:20:28.373
<i>*She's a super freak
Super freak</i>

2011
02:20:30.253 --> 02:20:33.984
Brought you monkeys
some coconuts...

2012
02:20:34.057 --> 02:20:36.855
from Quentin!

2013

<i></i>

2014
02:20:49.606 --> 02:20:53.269
<i> The only problem is,
Carlos is so strung out...</i>

2015
02:20:53.343 --> 02:20:56.039
<i>he can't see the wolf
in the henhouse.</i>

2016
02:20:56.113 --> 02:20:59.947
<i>If I know Red Ryder, as soon
as Carlos does the AV-ers'dirty work,</i>

2017
02:21:00.016 --> 02:21:02.280
<i>they'll pull
his protection,</i>

2018
02:21:02.352 --> 02:21:05.879
<i>and it'll be open season

2019
02:21:05.956 --> 02:21:08.049
<i> Carlos!</i>

2020
02:21:08.125 --> 02:21:10.218
No!

2021

<i>-
-  If I'm right,</i>

2022
02:21:19.202 --> 02:21:21.568
<i>all hell's
gonna break loose.</i>

2023
02:21:21.638 --> 02:21:23.606
<i>That's our chance, Magic.</i>

2024
02:21:23.673 --> 02:21:26.301
<i>Where there's war,
there's opportunity.</i>

2025
02:21:26.376 --> 02:21:30.608
<i>What we gotta do is wake Montana up
and move Onda into power.</i>

2026
02:21:45.629 --> 02:21:50.157
No, listen! Before we fuck up everything we
built, I have to have a meeting with the B.G.A.

2027
02:21:50.233 --> 02:21:51.860
<i>- Ç Vamos ahorita!
- Ç Chingao!</i>

2028
02:21:51.935 --> 02:21:56.167
We're making a horrible mistake.
Can't you understand that?

2029
02:21:56.239 --> 02:21:59.436
- Are you blind or what?
- Wait a minute! I said I want you ready!

2030
02:21:59.509 --> 02:22:01.875
<i>I'm not gonna waste the lives
of our soldados for nothing!</i>

2031
02:22:01.945 --> 02:22:04.175
<i>First we talk.
We fight only if we have to!</i>

2032
02:22:04.247 --> 02:22:08.081
- The time to strike is now! We wait, they'll destroy us!
- No, Magic!

2033
02:22:08.151 --> 02:22:11.985
<i>We gotta back El Mero Mero. If he says
meet with the B.G.A., we gotta do it.</i>

2034
02:22:12.055 --> 02:22:16.185
What are you talkin' about? If we stand by,
we're gonna watch Onda go down in flames!

2035
02:22:16.259 --> 02:22:17.191
Magic!

2036
02:22:26.937 --> 02:22:30.896
I want you to hit Smokey.
I want him dead by tomorrow.

2037
02:22:30.974 --> 02:22:34.307
<i>- Orale.
- And you set up a meeting with Bonafide.</i>

02:22:34.377 --> 02:22:38.814
<i>- Simon, Jefe.
-  Geronimo, dile a tus soldados que se calmen.</i>

2039
02:22:54.932 --> 02:22:56.991
Yo.

2040
02:22:57.067 --> 02:22:59.194
Thought I was off
your list, ese.

2041
02:23:00.904 --> 02:23:03.395
No, Smokes.
We straight.

2042
02:23:03.474 --> 02:23:05.567
<i>That heist was
the huevo's fuckup.</i>

2043
02:23:09.013 --> 02:23:13.347
- So, what do you want?
- Think you can move 300?

2044
02:23:13.417 --> 02:23:16.750
<i>Easy as mantequilla
on a hot tortilla.</i>

2045
02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:19.414
<i>Mira.</i>

2046
02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:22.550
<i>Go make yourself
some planta.</i>

2047
02:23:25.129 --> 02:23:27.120
<i>Orale.
Gracias, carnal.</i>

2048
02:23:27.197 --> 02:23:30.462
<i>Por nada.
I owe you.</i>

2049
02:23:35.205 --> 02:23:37.571
Motherfucker!

2050
02:23:46.650 --> 02:23:49.710
Get him around the park!

2051
02:23:49.787 --> 02:23:53.450
Three more California prison inmates
have been killed in gang violence,

2052
02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:56.220
bringing the tally of fatalities
this week to eleven.

2053
02:23:56.293 --> 02:23:58.727
Aguilar!

2054
02:23:58.796 --> 02:24:00.559
Aguilar.

2055
02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:03.623
Hey, chorizo. You still
want Popeye Savedra?

2056
02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:07.033
- Zuniga?
- They got a hit on me.

2057
02:24:07.104 --> 02:24:10.164
I need protection
or I'm dead.

2058
02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:13.903
Listen, Smokey. If you want protection,
you're gonna have to give me more than Popeye.

2059
02:24:13.977 --> 02:24:17.174
I want everything on Onda.
Who they are and where they are.

2060
02:24:17.247 --> 02:24:19.215
Hey, no way.
Forget about it.

2061
02:24:19.283 --> 02:24:23.982
Hey, don't talk shit, Smokey. You stay out
there alone, you're dead. You said so yourself.

2062
02:24:24.054 --> 02:24:27.615
All right. All right!
I'll give it to you.

2063
02:24:27.691 --> 02:24:31.627
<i>The whole layout.
Capitanes, soldados.</i>

2064
02:24:31.695 --> 02:24:34.220
- But I gotta be outta state first.
- We'll talk about it.

2065
02:24:34.298 --> 02:24:37.165
- Where can we meet?
- St. Mary's Church, Fourth and Chicago.

2066
02:24:37.234 --> 02:24:40.135
- I know it.
- Be there in 15 minutes, chorizo, or forget about it.

2067
02:24:40.204 --> 02:24:41.728
I'll be there.

2068
02:25:27.084 --> 02:25:29.518
<i></i>

2069
02:25:29.586 --> 02:25:33.784
<i></i>

2070
02:25:48.605 --> 02:25:50.698
<i> Aguilar?</i>

2071
02:25:52.943 --> 02:25:55.810
This is Lieutenant Ivan Burnett.
He's from San Quentin.

2072
02:25:55.879 --> 02:25:58.507
- Detective Paco Aguilar. How ya doin'? Yeah.
- This the victim?

2073
02:25:59.750 --> 02:26:01.718
Paco, we just heard
from Sacramento.

2074
02:26:01.785 --> 02:26:04.515
We are to "cooperate"
with Corrections on this.

2075
02:26:04.588 --> 02:26:06.818
<i>That means Burnett's
bringing down his entire team.</i>

2076
02:26:06.890 --> 02:26:09.324
- What does that mean? I'm out of it?
- You heard me.

2077
02:26:09.393 --> 02:26:13.295
Well, this is bullshit, Captain. Come on,
I've been working on this case for months.

2078
02:26:13.363 --> 02:26:16.560
This vato was about to give
me the full lowdown on Onda.

2079
02:26:16.633 --> 02:26:18.965
What do you know
about Onda?

2080
02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:22.096
I had a run-in with a couple of
these guys here.

2081
02:26:24.908 --> 02:26:27.843
- The whole council. Captain, I'll need this picture.
- Fine.

2082
02:26:27.911 --> 02:26:30.641
<i>- My chief investigator will debrief him tomorrow.
-  Wait a minute, man.</i>

2083
02:26:30.714 --> 02:26:32.841
<i>That's my evidence.
This is an East L.A. Case.</i>

2084
02:26:32.916 --> 02:26:36.909
Look, I appreciate your interest,
but this is much bigger than East L.A.

2085
02:26:36.987 --> 02:26:39.046
Things are poppin' up
all over the state.

2086
02:26:39.122 --> 02:26:40.987
You hear about
the grenade...

2087
02:26:41.058 --> 02:26:44.152
that was thrown into the Cheap Times
Social Club in Wilmington last night?

2088
02:26:46.096 --> 02:26:48.997
I'm betting that Zuniga here
was the quarterback.

2089
02:26:49.066 --> 02:26:52.797
Part of a plot started by his brother
in Quentin. It all comes outta Q.

2090
02:26:52.869 --> 02:26:54.803
All right, all right,
Lieutenant. Let's get inside.

2091
02:26:54.871 --> 02:26:56.805
This is happening here,
not in San Quentin.

2092
02:26:56.873 --> 02:26:59.603
It's all tied up to prison gangs now.
It's very complicated.

2093
02:26:59.676 --> 02:27:01.871
That's why
we're takin' over.

2094
02:27:01.945 --> 02:27:04.880
Do you speak Spanish?
You ever been in a street gang?

2095
02:27:04.948 --> 02:27:06.939
No, but my warden has
and he's Chicano.

2096
02:27:07.017 --> 02:27:09.850
Well, is your warden related
to someone on the Onda council?

2097
02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:12.912
Miklo Velka is my...
is my cousin.

2098
02:27:12.990 --> 02:27:15.982
I am related to him
by blood and by this.

2099
02:27:16.059 --> 02:27:19.495
Look, Lieutenant,
I don't mean any disrespect,

2100
02:27:19.563 --> 02:27:21.997
but I think I can get further
on this thing than you can.

2101
02:27:22.065 --> 02:27:24.056
All I'm asking is
that I'm involved.

2102
02:27:30.574 --> 02:27:32.007
Thank you.

2103
02:27:32.642 --> 02:27:38.512
There is no war here, Bonafide. This was a
personal thing between Carlos and Pockets.

2104
02:27:38.581 --> 02:27:41.448
Carlos and Pockets were loose cannons.
That was business.

2105
02:27:41.518 --> 02:27:45.284
But what you all did in L.A.
Night before last was bullshit.

2106
02:27:45.355 --> 02:27:47.289
There's gonna be more blood
on blades than broken bones...

2107
02:27:47.357 --> 02:27:49.291
'cause we ain't lettin' y'all
hit us in the back no more.

2108
02:27:49.359 --> 02:27:50.792
You wanna powwow?
You wanna talk? Go ahead, talk.

2109
02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:53.829
Onda had nothing to do
with Cheap Times.

2110
02:27:53.897 --> 02:27:57.993
Carlos' brother, Smokey,
acted on his orders, not Onda's,

2111
02:27:58.068 --> 02:28:00.059
and he's paid the price
with his life.

2112
02:28:00.136 --> 02:28:02.195
Cheap Times make for
cheap lives. Lots of'em.

2113
02:28:02.272 --> 02:28:05.764
You want a war? We're ready.
Believe me, we'll win.

2114
02:28:05.842 --> 02:28:09.835
We've got more soldiers and they'll go all
the way... to the death if they have to.

2115
02:28:09.913 --> 02:28:12.905
I got soldiers. My soldiers are
ready to die. We can prove that.

2116
02:28:12.983 --> 02:28:16.919
Is that what you want? I guarantee
that's what the Aryans want.

2117
02:28:16.987 --> 02:28:22.254
We can stop the killing now,
you and me, right here.

2118
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:31.057
Now your word means something here.
What about Folsom and Chino?

2119
02:28:31.134 --> 02:28:34.001
- I speak for them too.
- Uh-uh.

2120
02:28:34.070 --> 02:28:37.198
Maybe for Soto at Folsom, but your word
ain't reachin' to Chino right now.

2121
02:28:37.273 --> 02:28:41.039
Mosca Lopez is crazy. I done
lost three people down there.

2122
02:28:42.245 --> 02:28:45.510
I can ask the warden
for a temporary transfer.

2123
02:28:45.582 --> 02:28:48.449
<i>- He might agree if you guarantee peace while I'm gone.
- Fuck a truce!</i>

2124
02:28:48.518 --> 02:28:50.509
- We cannot...

2125
02:28:53.456 --> 02:28:55.481
Man, you got five days.

2126
02:28:57.627 --> 02:29:01.256
<i> I'm gonna hold
my side up for five days, man.</i>

2127
02:29:01.331 --> 02:29:03.356
Five days.

2128
02:29:06.970 --> 02:29:10.599
Miklo will coordinate
Onda business in my absence.

2129
02:29:10.673 --> 02:29:14.040
<i>You can trust he'll make sure
nothing happens while I'm away.</i>

2130
02:29:16.846 --> 02:29:18.905
So do we have
a truce?

2131
02:29:19.983 --> 02:29:23.544
<i>- Right on.
- Well, well, well.</i>

2132
02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:27.317
Wetbacks and Bonafide
porch monkeys holdin' hands.

2133
02:29:27.390 --> 02:29:30.257
<i></i>

2134
02:29:30.326 --> 02:29:32.760
You now have
a combined I.Q. Of two.

2135
02:29:32.829 --> 02:29:34.660
You're a dead man,
Wonder Bread!

2136
02:29:34.731 --> 02:29:37.723
Why don't you kiss my enriched
white ass, motherfucker?

2137
02:29:37.801 --> 02:29:40.133
<i>This here's my coon dog.
Get them coons, boy.</i>

2138
02:29:42.806 --> 02:29:44.740
Hey, Ryder!
What's goin' on?

2139
02:29:44.808 --> 02:29:49.108
Don't ask me what's goin' on! Ask,
"What are we doin' here? Is there a war?"

2140
02:29:49.179 --> 02:29:52.171
<i> Run 'em outta the goddamn
banks! Save the taxpayers some money!</i>

2141
02:29:52.248 --> 02:29:54.944
All right, gentlemen,
let's clear the yard!

2142
02:29:55.018 --> 02:29:57.043
It's between
the niggers and the spics!

2143
02:29:57.120 --> 02:29:59.111
We're white, white,
white, you motherfuckers!

2144
02:29:59.189 --> 02:30:01.851
<i> Jefe, will Bonafide
listen to me?</i>

2145
02:30:01.925 --> 02:30:03.859
Magic and the others
are warriors.

2146
02:30:03.927 --> 02:30:06.987
If I put one of them in charge,
Bonafide would never trust me.

2147
02:30:07.063 --> 02:30:09.793
You're a jailhouse lawyer,
a counselor.

2148
02:30:09.866 --> 02:30:12.960
- He knows you'll follow my wishes.
- But what if he's lying?

2149
02:30:13.036 --> 02:30:15.504
What if the B.G.A.
Doesn't want peace?

2150
02:30:15.572 --> 02:30:18.803
Nobody in here knows what peace is.
They've never had it.

2151
02:30:18.875 --> 02:30:22.038
<i>I'm talking
about power, carnal.</i>

2152
02:30:22.112 --> 02:30:26.173
The only way for us to gain real power
is for black and brown to come together.

2153
02:30:26.249 --> 02:30:29.343
<i>¿Me entiendes?</i>

2154
02:30:29.419 --> 02:30:32.855
<i> Huh. And I thought Popeye
Savedra was the leader of Onda.</i>

2155
02:30:32.922 --> 02:30:35.948
It's hard to buy it's
that little guy down there.

2156
02:30:36.025 --> 02:30:38.926
You better believe it.

2157
02:30:38.995 --> 02:30:41.463
He's got what you
call "charisma."

2158
02:30:41.531 --> 02:30:44.557
You really think he can do something
to stop the violence?

2159
02:30:44.634 --> 02:30:48.035
<i>Montana's got something that makes you
wanna listen to him. He's got a lot of heart.</i>

2160
02:30:48.104 --> 02:30:50.629
If anybody can stop
this war, it's him.

2161
02:30:50.707 --> 02:30:54.143
I can always bring in the guns,
but I'd rather it be him.

2162
02:30:54.210 --> 02:30:56.201
I don't like you
traveling alone.

2163
02:30:56.279 --> 02:30:59.476
I don't trust the administration.
I don't trust anybody.

2164
02:30:59.549 --> 02:31:03.576
Don't worry. The warden's
guaranteeing my passage.

2165
02:31:03.653 --> 02:31:07.646
<i>Top secret route.
Oye.</i>

2166
02:31:09.092 --> 02:31:11.959
I made a deal
with the vato.

2167
02:31:12.028 --> 02:31:16.294
I get to spend the night in Delano,
see my daughter.

2168
02:31:18.635 --> 02:31:22.696
After 14 years.
Can you believe it?

2169
02:31:22.772 --> 02:31:24.637
<i>Come on, Segura.</i>

2170
02:31:24.707 --> 02:31:26.140
Move it.

2171
02:31:29.879 --> 02:31:32.006
<i>Jefe.</i>

2172
02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:35.882
<i>Huacha. You tell
those vatos...</i>

2173
02:31:35.952 --> 02:31:39.115
<i>to find some shade and chill out
'til I get back, eh?</i>

2174
02:31:39.189 --> 02:31:41.123
You got it.

2175
02:31:47.297 --> 02:31:49.561
<i> What time's
my daughter coming?</i>

2176
02:31:49.632 --> 02:31:52.192
She'll be here
about 7:00 sharp.

2177
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:10.342
- We'll rack you at 6:00 tomorrow for a shower.
- I'll be waiting.

2178
02:32:14.924 --> 02:32:19.327
<i>- Psst! Name's Wallace.
- Montana.</i>

2179
02:32:19.395 --> 02:32:23.229
Say, amigo, you ain't got
no street smokes, do ya?

2180
02:32:23.299 --> 02:32:25.426
<i>This state tobacco, man,
it'll kill ya.</i>

2181
02:32:25.501 --> 02:32:27.526
I don't smoke.

2182
02:32:28.871 --> 02:32:31.101
You don't smoke, huh?

2183
02:32:31.174 --> 02:32:34.769
Man, I can't wait for these
son-of-a-bitches to let me outta here...

2184
02:32:34.844 --> 02:32:37.142
<i>so I can find me
a field crew.</i>

2185
02:32:37.213 --> 02:32:40.671
Do me some pickin' so I can send my old
lady some money back in Louisiana.

2186
02:32:42.185 --> 02:32:45.518
<i>- Yeah, I used to pick a little when I was a kid.
- Huh.</i>

2187
02:32:45.588 --> 02:32:48.352
Me, I been followin'
this crop all my life.

2188
02:32:48.424 --> 02:32:50.688
If it ain't that,
I takes me a little drink.

2189
02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:55.197
<i>If it ain't that, they got me
behind bars tryin'to dry out.</i>

2190
02:32:58.001 --> 02:33:00.196
You ever pick
any grapes, Wallace?

2191
02:33:03.006 --> 02:33:06.840
No, I ain't never picked no grapes.
But I done cut me a bunch.

2192
02:33:09.212 --> 02:33:11.271
Yeah.

2193
02:33:20.123 --> 02:33:22.318
- Here.
- Oh, man, thank you.

2194
02:33:26.362 --> 02:33:29.798
Is it... Say, amigo, d-do you mind
any if I have two?

2195
02:33:29.866 --> 02:33:32.767
- Ah, keep the pack. They're only for trade.
- Oh, man.

2196
02:33:32.835 --> 02:33:36.293
<i> Lights out.</i>

2197
02:33:36.372 --> 02:33:40.570
<i>You know, when I was a kid,
I used to love to pick.</i>

2198
02:33:42.312 --> 02:33:47.409
Nothing like fresh vegetables
and fruit right from the vine.

2199
02:33:49.919 --> 02:33:53.218
Yeah.
Hmm.

2200
02:34:01.798 --> 02:34:05.199
Okay, the escort's on his way.
You'll have one hour with your father.

2201
02:34:05.268 --> 02:34:07.736
- Let's go.
- I'd like a couple of seconds to straighten up.

2202
02:34:07.803 --> 02:34:10.704
I don't care who you are in San Quentin.
You're nobody here in Kern County.

2203
02:34:10.773 --> 02:34:13.571
<i>Look, officer. I haven't seen
my daughter in 14 years.</i>

2204
02:34:13.642 --> 02:34:16.577
Could I just take a couple of seconds
to straighten up?

2205
02:34:16.645 --> 02:34:18.670
Please?

2206
02:34:23.419 --> 02:34:27.321
<i>I'm gonna put your daughter in the
visiting room. You've got one hour.</i>

2207
02:34:27.390 --> 02:34:30.985
The clock is ticking.
One hour. Be right back.

2208
02:34:34.663 --> 02:34:37.530
Mornin', Montana.

2209
02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:40.262
Morning, Wallace.

2210
02:34:40.336 --> 02:34:43.499
See they botherin' with ya
early in the mornin', huh?

2211
02:34:45.341 --> 02:34:48.572
No. It's a good day.

2212
02:34:48.644 --> 02:34:51.477
I'm not gonna let
anything ruin it.

2213
02:34:51.547 --> 02:34:55.711
Aaah! Ooh, them damn
short-handle holes!

2214
02:34:55.785 --> 02:34:57.980
Yeah, I used to
feel those myself.

2215
02:34:58.054 --> 02:35:00.420
Oh... Oh!

2216
02:35:01.957 --> 02:35:05.017
Here, amigo.
Why don't you use this?

2217
02:35:06.962 --> 02:35:09.021
Yeah, well,
I'll hold it for you.

2218
02:35:11.901 --> 02:35:14.062
Thank you.

2219
02:35:14.136 --> 02:35:16.900
<i>Yeah, chingo de tiempo
since I felt this good.</i>

2220
02:35:16.972 --> 02:35:18.906
<i>My daughter's coming today.
Mi hijita.</i>

2221
02:35:18.974 --> 02:35:22.842
- Oh, man, today is gonna be such a good day for you.
- Yeah.

2222
02:35:22.912 --> 02:35:24.903
Your daughter's
gonna be so proud of you.

2223
02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:26.311
- There.

2224
02:35:26.382 --> 02:35:28.907
- Uh-huh.

2225
02:35:28.984 --> 02:35:31.953
Now this is what they call
"a change of plans."

2226
02:35:32.021 --> 02:35:35.855
<i>For Cheap Times!
For Cheap Times!</i>

2227
02:35:35.925 --> 02:35:38.450
<i>-
- Son-of-a-bitch!</i>

2228
02:35:38.527 --> 02:35:40.927
Motherfucker, think you can
blow up my brother! Uh-uh!

2229
02:35:40.996 --> 02:35:43.931
<i>- Daaah!
- You can go join your maker now.</i>

2230
02:35:43.999 --> 02:35:46.365
For what falls
to the floor is his.

2231
02:35:48.404 --> 02:35:50.736
Don't forget your smokes.

2232
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:57.664
- You want a war? I'll give you a fuckin' war!
- No! Stop him!

2233
02:36:57.740 --> 02:37:00.675
No! They're waiting for us
to run in blind!

2234
02:37:00.743 --> 02:37:03.075
<i>They'll cut us down!
We gotta think like Mero Mero.</i>

2235
02:37:03.145 --> 02:37:08.447
<i>- You're not Mero Mero!
- No, I'm not! But I'm alive!</i>

2236
02:37:08.517 --> 02:37:12.544
<i>And I'm gonna stay that way! And I
want mi familia to stay that way too!</i>

2237
02:37:12.621 --> 02:37:15.590
We gotta plan like men,
not get shot down like dogs!

2238
02:37:17.426 --> 02:37:19.860
Wait and be ready,
Magic!

2239
02:37:21.864 --> 02:37:25.425
Again. How'd you know
he was in Delano?

2240
02:37:25.501 --> 02:37:28.026
How'd you know the head
of La Onda was there?

2241
02:37:28.103 --> 02:37:31.163
Man, I do not give
a good goddamn...

2242
02:37:31.240 --> 02:37:33.265
who that taco-eatin'
motherfucker was.

2243
02:37:33.342 --> 02:37:35.606
Oh, who that taco-eatin'
motherfucker was!

2244
02:37:35.678 --> 02:37:39.375
- Do you know who you killed, asshole?
- Your mama!

2245
02:37:39.448 --> 02:37:43.885
<i>- We're gonna stay here all day until you...
-  He won't crack.</i>

2246
02:37:43.953 --> 02:37:46.615
Nope. He's been in
for 30 years.

2247
02:37:46.689 --> 02:37:49.487
He's as tough
as three-inch steel.

2248
02:37:49.558 --> 02:37:52.550
<i>-
- When I get back, I'm gonna bust your ass.</i>

2249
02:37:52.628 --> 02:37:55.096
I'll be here.

2250
02:38:00.369 --> 02:38:02.303
Come in here.

2251
02:38:04.139 --> 02:38:07.267
<i>Yeah, that's the man. That's the one
who ordered it. Bring him in here.</i>

2252
02:38:07.343 --> 02:38:10.801
- Tell him what you told me.
- I didn't order no hit on nobody.

2253
02:38:10.879 --> 02:38:12.972
That'd be like throwin'
gasoline on fire right now.

2254
02:38:13.048 --> 02:38:15.573
Don't bullshit me, man.
I ain't no sucker.

2255
02:38:15.651 --> 02:38:18.586
<i>He's B.G.A.
He made the hit. He's your man.</i>

2256
02:38:18.654 --> 02:38:21.384
I ain't tryin' to play you
for no sucker, brother.

2257
02:38:21.457 --> 02:38:25.052
I'm just tellin' you, if I wanted to hit
Montana, I'd have used a free-lancer.

2258
02:38:25.127 --> 02:38:27.288
<i>An AV-er, so it
couldn't be traced.</i>

2259
02:38:27.363 --> 02:38:30.025
I'm not
a stupid man, sir.

2260
02:38:30.099 --> 02:38:33.296
<i> That's enough.
Come on over here with me.</i>

2261
02:38:37.239 --> 02:38:39.969
<i>-  Is that your man?
-  Yeah, that's him.</i>

2262
02:38:40.042 --> 02:38:43.273
- Why don't you let me talk to him?
- No way!

2263
02:38:43.345 --> 02:38:46.280
He ain't gonna
tell you nothin'.

2264
02:38:46.348 --> 02:38:50.284
You wanna get to the bottom of this
problem? You wanna deal with it?

2265
02:38:50.352 --> 02:38:52.445
Now, I know
he'll talk to me.

2266
02:38:53.756 --> 02:38:55.690
Your call.

2267
02:39:16.145 --> 02:39:20.013
- Goddamn. The Man got you down here too?
- Yeah.

2268
02:39:21.483 --> 02:39:23.917
Look here.

2269
02:39:26.422 --> 02:39:28.390
Why you hit Montana?

2270
02:39:30.793 --> 02:39:33.853
Oh, I dig. The Man got
his eyes and ears in the wall.

2271
02:39:33.929 --> 02:39:36.397
Don't sweat, brother.
I'm gonna maintain.

2272
02:39:37.666 --> 02:39:39.600
Who ordered the hit?

2273
02:39:42.171 --> 02:39:44.139
You did.

2274
02:39:44.206 --> 02:39:46.401
Come here.

2275
02:39:49.278 --> 02:39:51.212
Oh!

2276
02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:53.441
You did, man!

2277
02:39:53.515 --> 02:39:57.042
- You did. I got your kite, man.
- I didn't send you nothin'.

2278
02:39:57.119 --> 02:39:59.314
<i>- Ow! Ow! Fuck!
- Who ordered it?</i>

2279
02:39:59.388 --> 02:40:02.186
You did, man. You did.
I got your comb.

2280
02:40:02.257 --> 02:40:05.124
<i>- I know your design.
- You got my comb?</i>

2281
02:40:05.194 --> 02:40:08.630
Yeah, I got your comb. I opened it up.
I read the message, I burned it.

2282
02:40:08.697 --> 02:40:11.097
It was your comb, man!

2283
02:40:12.935 --> 02:40:15.096
<i> Listen, man,
we've got five minutes.</i>

2284
02:40:15.170 --> 02:40:17.900
<i>The warden let me come in here
to talk to you about Montana's murder.</i>

2285
02:40:17.973 --> 02:40:20.271
Who the fuck are you
to come here like this?

2286
02:40:20.342 --> 02:40:22.640
Montana's none of
your fucking business!

2287
02:40:22.711 --> 02:40:24.872
You gotta listen to me, Miklo.

2288
02:40:24.947 --> 02:40:26.972
Bonafide says somebody
counterfeited his comb...

2289
02:40:27.049 --> 02:40:29.279
and put a phony message
in it to hit Montana.

2290
02:40:29.351 --> 02:40:32.320
- The B.G.A. Didn't do it.
- That's bullshit!

2291
02:40:32.388 --> 02:40:34.322
We know the fuckin' B.G.A.
Killed him.

2292
02:40:34.390 --> 02:40:37.621
Yeah? Well, the administration doesn't
think so. And what if they're right?

2293
02:40:37.693 --> 02:40:42.528
You wanna be responsible for starting a
fucking war against the wrong people? Huh?

2294
02:40:44.032 --> 02:40:46.330
Listen, man,
I know you hate me.

2295
02:40:46.402 --> 02:40:49.997
I shot your leg off, and that's something I'm
gonna have to live with for the rest of my life.

2296
02:40:50.072 --> 02:40:54.736
But you're still my blood, and I'm not gonna
stand here and watch you destroy yourself.

2297
02:40:54.810 --> 02:40:58.940
If you start this war, you and
your vatos will be committing suicide.

2298
02:40:59.014 --> 02:41:01.005
Now look over there.
You see the warden?

2299
02:41:01.083 --> 02:41:04.985
<i>He's got all the firepower he needs, and
he ain't afraid to use it, believe me.</i>

2300
02:41:05.053 --> 02:41:07.214
Do you want that?

2301
02:41:09.491 --> 02:41:11.925
Oh, you're The Man now,
aren't you?

2302
02:41:11.994 --> 02:41:14.622
Look, Montana left you
in charge, right?

2303
02:41:14.696 --> 02:41:17.256
Be a real leader, man.
Protect your people.

2304
02:41:17.332 --> 02:41:19.800
Meet with Bonafide.
What do you got to lose?

2305
02:41:25.707 --> 02:41:27.675
I'll meet him in the yard.

2306
02:41:27.876 --> 02:41:31.471
<i> One lieutenant each.
No guards around.</i>

2307
02:41:31.546 --> 02:41:34.481
That's far enough.
Let 'em go on their own.

2308
02:41:44.559 --> 02:41:47.960
I swear to you,
it wasn't the B.G.A.

2309
02:41:48.029 --> 02:41:51.021
Montana was a stand-up dude.
We were set up!

2310
02:41:51.099 --> 02:41:54.159
That old man was no jive-ass punk.
He was hard-core B.G.A.

2311
02:41:54.235 --> 02:41:57.398
That's right. That's why
it don't make no sense.

2312
02:41:57.472 --> 02:42:01.238
I take out Montana with my own man?
That's suicide.

2313
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:06.008
Now you do what you wanna do,
but think about this:

2314
02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:10.039
Who you think stands to gain
if B.G.A. And Onda war?

2315
02:42:10.118 --> 02:42:13.144
The fuckin' A.V.!

2316
02:42:13.221 --> 02:42:15.246
<i>Oh, yeah, they want us
to take each other out.</i>

2317
02:42:15.323 --> 02:42:19.555
Then they step in and take over
everything. We go back to bein' slaves.

2318
02:42:19.627 --> 02:42:22.755
The AV-ers.

2319
02:42:22.830 --> 02:42:27.324
They're the only ones who could've gotten
Montana's route from the white guards. Right?

2320
02:42:27.402 --> 02:42:29.597
I work with Lightning
in the wood shop.

2321
02:42:29.671 --> 02:42:35.075
He gets my comb, he counterfeits it,
he sends it to Wallace.

2322
02:42:36.878 --> 02:42:39.779
<i>- It's possible.
- And now that motherfucker Red Ryder...</i>

2323
02:42:39.847 --> 02:42:43.442
sittin' in a front-row seat just waitin'
on us to take each other out.

2324
02:42:43.518 --> 02:42:47.978
- So what do you propose?
- I say whip those motherfuckers together.

2325
02:42:48.056 --> 02:42:50.547
We do to them
what they tryin' to do to us.

2326
02:42:54.028 --> 02:42:55.962
<i> You see those
pinche vultures?</i>

2327
02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:59.295
They're watchin' us with
a magnifying glass right now.

2328
02:43:00.902 --> 02:43:04.633
So for the next six months,
we'll practice a good-neighbor policy.

2329
02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:08.731
So we got a deal?
We join forces?

2330
02:43:08.810 --> 02:43:10.835
Yeah.

2331
02:43:10.912 --> 02:43:13.972
And we'll celebrate a big
Mexican holiday together.

2332
02:43:14.048 --> 02:43:16.778
Now which one
you talkin' about?

2333
02:43:16.851 --> 02:43:18.751
<i>Dia de los muertos.</i>

2334
02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:20.549
That means what now?

2335
02:43:20.621 --> 02:43:22.646
Day of the Dead.

2336
02:43:24.826 --> 02:43:28.592
- All right.
-  Right.

2337
02:43:32.533 --> 02:43:34.626
In six months.

2338
02:43:34.702 --> 02:43:36.636
My man.

2339
02:43:36.704 --> 02:43:38.797
They're shakin' hands.
We got a truce.

2340
02:43:38.873 --> 02:43:41.967
We won't congratulate ourselves
too soon. We'll wait and see.

2341
02:43:46.748 --> 02:43:49.182
<i>
I don't trust that dude.</i>

2342
02:43:49.250 --> 02:43:51.411
No, no, no.
This boy's in way over his head.

2343
02:43:51.486 --> 02:43:53.920
He ain't got no choice
but to go with us right now.

2344
02:43:53.988 --> 02:43:57.754
<i>We help them take out the AV-ers,
we're making the mayates stronger, ese.</i>

2345
02:43:57.825 --> 02:43:59.816
<i>It's okay, carnal.</i>

2346
02:43:59.894 --> 02:44:03.523
When you expect nothing and you get
everything, that's destiny.

2347
02:44:03.598 --> 02:44:08.365
The B.G.A. Wants to help us take out
the AV-ers? All right.

2348
02:44:08.436 --> 02:44:10.734
We'll throw a little
white meat to the dogs.

2349
02:44:10.805 --> 02:44:12.773
Then we'll rob

<i>Ç Orale!</i>

2351
02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:35.021
<i>Gracias, carnal.
You were right.</i>

2352
02:44:35.096 --> 02:44:37.360
You did the right
thing, Miklo.

2353
02:44:37.431 --> 02:44:39.365
Tell your mom
I love her, okay?

2354
02:44:39.433 --> 02:44:41.526
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- Yeah.

2355
02:44:47.525 --> 02:44:49.516

02:45:35.173 --> 02:45:38.336
Hey, homes, if anybody
messes with you, ese.

2359
02:46:11.108 --> 02:46:13.770
<i>I'm sorry, ama.</i>

02:46:16.414 --> 02:46:20.475
<i>- I loved Juanito.
- I know, mi hijo.</i>

2362
02:46:20.551 --> 02:46:23.315
<i> I loved him, ama.</i>

2363
02:46:23.387 --> 02:46:26.447
<i>

2364
02:46:49.513 --> 02:46:51.481
I'm sorry.

2365
02:46:52.383 --> 02:46:55.546
I missed you.

2366
02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:58.054

...she put the handcuffs on,
two days later, I come back.

2369
02:47:15.539 --> 02:47:18.337
She's got eye hooks drilled
in the door. She's got thongs.

2370
02:47:18.409 --> 02:47:23.403
I swear to God, she absolutely
loved it! She became or...

2371
02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:36.583

2372
02:47:41.032 --> 02:47:45.059
<i>*</i>

2373
02:48:10.161 --> 02:48:12.026
- You got it. One more.

2374
02:48:12.096 --> 02:48:14.792
- Come on, one more.

2375
02:48:19.971 --> 02:48:23.202
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
No more. No more, man.</i>

2376
02:48:23.274 --> 02:48:25.401
I'm through, okay?
That's it.

2377
02:48:25.476 --> 02:48:27.341
<i> Ten cents
a fuckin'hour.</i>

2378
02:48:27.411 --> 02:48:30.812
<i>That spic warden ain't gettin'
a nickel's worth of overtime outta me.</i>

2379
02:48:36.053 --> 02:48:38.248
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

2380
02:48:38.322 --> 02:48:41.120
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you
goddamn people! Are you...</i>

2381
02:48:41.192 --> 02:48:44.593
<i>Goddamn it! You stupid fuckin'
asshole! You got it in my eyes!</i>

2382
02:48:44.662 --> 02:48:47.995
Lousy...
Aaah!

2383
02:49:04.348 --> 02:49:06.976
<i>Now everybody keeps their mouth shut,
you understand me?</i>

2384
02:49:07.051 --> 02:49:09.679
This way, won't be no problem
with nobody when the shit go down.

2385
02:49:09.754 --> 02:49:11.745
The plan's
gonna work, Bonafide.

2386
02:49:11.822 --> 02:49:13.983
I'm telling you, man,
we keep our stake together.

2387
02:49:14.058 --> 02:49:16.549
- That way we control the whole joint, right?
- All right.

2388
02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:55.497
You want some of this?
You want some of this?

2389
02:50:04.875 --> 02:50:08.777
Who do these punks
think they are? Look at this!

2390
02:50:08.846 --> 02:50:12.282
It's unbelievable.
Every hit was strategic.

2391
02:50:12.349 --> 02:50:14.909
First they knocked off
most of the A.V. Leadership,

2392
02:50:14.985 --> 02:50:16.953
and then they
finished off the B.G.A.

2393
02:50:17.021 --> 02:50:20.980
I don't like being lied to.
I want the Onda council broken up.

2394
02:50:21.058 --> 02:50:24.653
<i>Use interstate compact. I want 'em outta here.
Get 'em outta here before the end of the week.</i>

2395
02:50:24.728 --> 02:50:28.994
<i> Taxpayers
just saved another three million bucks.</i>

2396
02:50:29.066 --> 02:50:32.433
<i>Everything's a fuckin'joke to
you, man. What's your problem?</i>

2397
02:50:32.503 --> 02:50:36.269
<i>- What's my problem? You got a problem!
- No, you don't understand, man.</i>

2398
02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:39.832
That little bastard's up there playing
God and he's got an army to back him up.

2399
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:42.435
<i>Yeah, I don't understand, right?
I don't ever understand, right?</i>

2400
02:50:42.513 --> 02:50:46.313
Well, as long as he's doing it behind bars,
it's not gonna affect you or me, is it?

2401
02:50:46.383 --> 02:50:48.510
<i>- Is it?
- Oh, it's not gonna affect us?</i>

2402
02:50:48.586 --> 02:50:50.520
Won't affect
any of us, will it?

2403
02:51:19.049 --> 02:51:21.176
You used me.

2404
02:51:21.252 --> 02:51:24.551
I tried to save your life and you
used me to set up the B.G.A.

2405
02:51:24.622 --> 02:51:27.989
They would've come after us
if we hadn't got them first.

2406
02:51:28.058 --> 02:51:31.357
<i>- I did what I had to for my brothers to survive.
- Your brothers?</i>

2407
02:51:31.428 --> 02:51:35.228
And what am I, Miklo?
Man, you grew up with me.

2408
02:51:35.299 --> 02:51:39.030
You slept in my room.
You wore my fuckin' clothes!

2409
02:51:39.103 --> 02:51:43.164
How could you use your own flesh and
blood to help massacre all those people?

2410
02:51:43.240 --> 02:51:47.370
I didn't wanna hurt you, Paco.
In here, you use what you've got.

2411
02:51:47.444 --> 02:51:50.538
<i>Without your help,
a lot of carnales would've died.</i>

2412
02:51:50.614 --> 02:51:53.208
- Gracias...
- Don't you thank me.

2413
02:51:53.284 --> 02:51:55.252
I hate what you did.

2414
02:51:55.319 --> 02:51:57.378
I hate what
you stand for.

2415
02:51:59.557 --> 02:52:02.856
You know, Paquito,
for a long time I hated you.

2416
02:52:04.361 --> 02:52:07.194
I blamed you for everything.

2417
02:52:07.264 --> 02:52:10.165
But then I realized something
that changed my life.

2418
02:52:11.569 --> 02:52:15.562
Everything you did...
even shooting my leg off...

2419
02:52:15.639 --> 02:52:17.869
forced me into my destiny.

2420
02:52:17.942 --> 02:52:20.103
Made me discover myself.

2421
02:52:20.177 --> 02:52:23.078
Find my real family,
my home.

2422
02:52:23.147 --> 02:52:25.081
Here.

2423
02:52:25.149 --> 02:52:28.778
<i>Inside these walls,
I found the strength of La Raza.</i>

2424
02:52:28.852 --> 02:52:32.811
<i>You got no fuckin' idea
what La Raza means.</i>

2425
02:52:32.890 --> 02:52:38.795
<i>It's about our people out there, working,
surviving, with pride and dignity. That's raza.</i>

2426
02:52:38.862 --> 02:52:42.263
Not lying and murdering.

2427
02:52:42.333 --> 02:52:44.631
All you got is
your white father's hate.

2428
02:52:46.637 --> 02:52:50.437
Still hung up on my
fluorescent skin, vato? Hmm?

2429
02:52:51.642 --> 02:52:53.667
He wasn't my real father.

2430
02:52:53.744 --> 02:52:57.840
Montana was.
He taught me about respect.

2431
02:52:57.915 --> 02:52:59.906
<i>You gotta be willing
to die for it.</i>

2432
02:52:59.984 --> 02:53:04.512
Like you. Like you not deserting me
after the car crash at El Pino.

2433
02:53:04.588 --> 02:53:06.613
That was real respect
for a brother.

2434
02:53:08.859 --> 02:53:11.623
<i>And I'll always
love you for it, carnal.</i>

2435
02:53:11.695 --> 02:53:15.290
Miklo, it's not about drive-bys
and gang fights anymore.

2436
02:53:15.366 --> 02:53:18.767
<i>- It's about...
- Let's stop fighting, carnal! We're family.</i>

2437
02:53:18.836 --> 02:53:21.771
We should help each other,
not cut each other's throats.

2438
02:53:25.776 --> 02:53:27.971
Let's be brothers again.

2439
02:53:34.385 --> 02:53:38.754
Just because you're a cop and I'm a con
doesn't mean we can't cooperate.

2440
02:53:40.891 --> 02:53:44.850
I can give you tips from inside that
could really help you out on the street.

2441
02:53:47.498 --> 02:53:50.433
You got a lot of power
out there, man.

2442
02:53:50.501 --> 02:53:54.335
Your guidance and advice
would be invaluable to me.

2443
02:53:54.405 --> 02:53:58.466
What are you asking me?
To be a member of your gang?

2444
02:53:58.542 --> 02:54:01.010
Are you outta
your fuckin' mind?

2445
02:54:01.078 --> 02:54:05.811
Do you remember how we
took out Spider for Cruz?

2446
02:54:05.883 --> 02:54:08.818
Together, Paco.
We're unbeatable.

2447
02:54:13.290 --> 02:54:17.283
Your Onda's not my onda,
and it never will be.

2448
02:54:19.396 --> 02:54:22.422
Paco!

2449
02:54:25.169 --> 02:54:28.297
I'll always be
your brother, vato loco.

2450
02:54:28.372 --> 02:54:30.465
Never.

2451
02:54:40.084 --> 02:54:42.780
<i>- Orale, Chivito.
- Tucha, carnal. They're watching, homes.</i>

2452
02:54:42.853 --> 02:54:44.878
I know they are.
Let 'em watch.

2453
02:54:44.955 --> 02:54:49.722
<i> The show's just beginning
and they don't even know it.</i>

2454
02:54:49.793 --> 02:54:52.762
<i>This will probably be our last
meeting together, carnales.</i>

2455
02:54:54.698 --> 02:54:59.192
They're trying to break Onda up.
But you know what?

2456
02:54:59.269 --> 02:55:01.999
They're only
helping us grow.

2457
02:55:03.507 --> 02:55:05.532
They're using
the interstate compact...

2458
02:55:05.609 --> 02:55:08.908
<i>to exchange each of you who's from
out of state for cons from Califas.</i>

2459
02:55:10.614 --> 02:55:13.447
So, Chivo, they're
sending you back to Arizona.

2460
02:55:13.517 --> 02:55:16.543
<i>- ¿Como dices?
- Hey, man, we can't do nothin' about it.</i>

2461
02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:19.714
You gotta go. But at least
you'll be back to your mom, man.

2462
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:22.418
She needs anything, let me know.
I'll take care of her.

2463
02:55:22.493 --> 02:55:25.951
<i>Orale, homes.
Simon que si.</i>

2464
02:55:26.029 --> 02:55:30.398
Geronimo goes back
to Texas.

2465
02:55:30.467 --> 02:55:34.335
<i>- You straighten your son out, ¿que no?
- Simon.</i>

2466
02:55:37.174 --> 02:55:39.199
They're trying
to break up La Onda!

2467
02:55:39.276 --> 02:55:41.210
But we're gonna
turn it on 'em!

2468
02:55:43.414 --> 02:55:45.439
And you know how
we're gonna do that?

2469
02:55:47.117 --> 02:55:51.076
Each of you is gonna establish
your own chapters.

2470
02:55:51.155 --> 02:55:56.320
La Onda has $15,000 for each of you
so you can start things out strong.

2471
02:55:56.393 --> 02:56:01.262
We're gonna spread La Onda
gospel Billy Graham style!

2472
02:56:01.331 --> 02:56:03.390
Yeah.
Say it, homey.

2473
02:56:09.339 --> 02:56:11.364
<i>El Mero Mero
had a dream.</i>

2474
02:56:14.711 --> 02:56:16.872
We are that dream.

2475
02:56:18.115 --> 02:56:21.278
We're gonna multiply
in numbers undreamed of.

2476
02:56:21.351 --> 02:56:23.819
<i>In every pinta,
every barrio.</i>

2477
02:56:23.887 --> 02:56:26.720
Every southwestern state.

2478
02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:28.849
La Onda
has a destiny...

2479
02:56:28.926 --> 02:56:31.394
and no one can stop us.

2480
02:56:35.966 --> 02:56:38.491
<i>Ç Eso!</i>

2481
02:56:41.004 --> 02:56:43.063
<i>Ç Orale!</i>

2482
02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:45.165
<i>Ç Viva La Onda!</i>

2483
02:56:45.242 --> 02:56:47.710
<i>- Tocale, carnal. Orale.
- Viva.</i>

2484
02:56:57.972 --> 02:57:00.372
<i>What about me, carnal?</i>

2485
02:57:00.441 --> 02:57:02.909
Where do I go?

2486
02:57:02.977 --> 02:57:06.105
<i>You stay with me, carnal.</i>

2487
02:57:06.180 --> 02:57:08.580
You're the eyes
behind my back.

2488
02:57:08.649 --> 02:57:10.708
The leg I don't have.

2489
02:57:10.785 --> 02:57:13.185
<i>The other half
of mi corazon.</i>

2490
02:57:26.601 --> 02:57:28.899
You ordered me
to destroy this mold.

2491
02:57:31.272 --> 02:57:36.403
But I kept it for protection...
from you.

2492
02:57:39.881 --> 02:57:42.213
Now I want you
to destroy it.

2493
02:58:00.868 --> 02:58:03.837
- I loved him.
- We both loved him.

2494
02:58:03.905 --> 02:58:07.204
But we did what we
had to do for Onda!

2495
02:58:07.275 --> 02:58:10.244
You were right.

2496
02:58:39.907 --> 02:58:42.273
I give my life to you.

2497
02:58:43.511 --> 02:58:46.207
<i>Ç Jefe!</i>

2498
02:58:55.122 --> 02:58:57.181
<i>Simon.</i>

2499
02:59:10.704 --> 02:59:13.070
<i>-  What are we doing here?
- No llores, vato.</i>

2500
02:59:13.140 --> 02:59:16.166
<i>No mas ven.</i>

2501
02:59:16.243 --> 02:59:19.679
- Come on, man.
- Man, you got me outta bed to come down here?

2502
02:59:19.747 --> 02:59:21.908
Think you lost more
than your hair, vato.

2503
02:59:21.982 --> 02:59:25.748
Ha! Don't believe all that
shit you hear about Samson, ese.

2504
02:59:25.819 --> 02:59:29.016
I'm just strippin' myself
down to the bone, homes.

2505
02:59:29.089 --> 02:59:32.252
<i>- What if I said I wouldn't come?
- Shit, I knew you would come.</i>

2506
02:59:33.494 --> 02:59:35.485
<i>Shee... Huacha.</i>

2507
02:59:35.562 --> 02:59:38.190
Come look at yourself
in the mirror, ese.

2508
02:59:42.002 --> 02:59:43.936
Oh, man.

2509
02:59:44.004 --> 02:59:46.529
<i>It's not all
marked up, man.</i>

2510
02:59:46.607 --> 02:59:48.598
<i>It's a sign
of respect.</i>

2511
02:59:48.676 --> 02:59:53.704
For ten years, man, I've been
Star Trekking in the Twilight Zone.

2512
02:59:53.781 --> 02:59:57.615
<i>Thought if I came and looked at this,
I might find my way back, ¿que no?</i>

2513
02:59:59.219 --> 03:00:02.017
<i> Damn!
We were all innocent, eh.</i>

2514
03:00:02.089 --> 03:00:06.048
That's all gone, Cruzito.
It ain't like that anymore.

2515
03:00:06.126 --> 03:00:09.584
<i>What, not even a little carnalismo
left in there, ese?</i>

2516
03:00:09.663 --> 03:00:12.996
What, you think you use brotherhood up
like a shot of tequila?

2517
03:00:13.067 --> 03:00:17.231
<i> You just drink it down,
it burns, makes you feel good, ya?</i>

2518
03:00:17.304 --> 03:00:19.636
<i>And you're left with a hangover
the rest of your life?</i>

2519
03:00:19.707 --> 03:00:21.675
Look, man, you showed me
your mural.

2520
03:00:21.742 --> 03:00:23.835
You're a good artist.
I think you're the best.

2521
03:00:23.911 --> 03:00:25.902
Now come on. Let's go.

2522
03:00:25.979 --> 03:00:29.244
Just 'cause you wear sunglasses
don't mean you're blind, ese.

2523
03:00:29.316 --> 03:00:31.910
Oh, shit! You wanna know
what I see up there?

2524
03:00:31.985 --> 03:00:34.385
A fantasy, man.
A dream.

2525
03:00:34.455 --> 03:00:37.117
Three vatos looking for
something that wasn't there.

2526
03:00:37.191 --> 03:00:41.560
Loco, we stood by each other.
We trusted each other.

2527
03:00:41.628 --> 03:00:43.391
<i>Ç Orale! That's
worth believing in!</i>

2528
03:00:43.464 --> 03:00:45.432
<i>Shit, we were familia,
homes.</i>

2529
03:00:45.499 --> 03:00:49.993
And never again, Cruzito.
Miklo and I are finished, man.

2530
03:00:50.070 --> 03:00:53.369
<i>He ain't my family!
I hate that fuckin' puto!</i>

2531
03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:55.931
You oughta scrape his ass
off the wall like dirt.

2532
03:00:56.009 --> 03:01:00.469
<i>Chale, vato. No matter how much hate there is
between you and him, you're still connected.</i>

2533
03:01:00.547 --> 03:01:03.607
You got the same blood pumping
through both your hearts, ese.

2534
03:01:03.684 --> 03:01:05.879
That's a bond
you can never break.

2535
03:01:05.953 --> 03:01:08.751
Neither can Miklo.

2536
03:01:08.822 --> 03:01:10.722
He's still just trying
to be like you!

2537
03:01:10.791 --> 03:01:13.316
<i>- That's bullshit!
- Ç Simon, ese! Come on!</i>

2538
03:01:13.394 --> 03:01:16.295
<i>Ç El Gallo Negro!
The baddest Chicano in the barrio!</i>

2539
03:01:16.363 --> 03:01:19.355
Yeah, well, that ain't me!
Not anymore.

2540
03:01:22.035 --> 03:01:23.969
You ain't changed
a bit, ese.

2541
03:01:25.372 --> 03:01:27.340
Oh, so what?
What are you saying?

2542
03:01:27.408 --> 03:01:29.672
It's all my fault the way
everything turned out?

2543
03:01:41.889 --> 03:01:43.880
Oh, I see.

2544
03:01:50.898 --> 03:01:52.991
<i>Orale.</i>

2545
03:01:53.066 --> 03:01:55.967
What, you think you got
so much fucking power, huh?

2546
03:01:59.239 --> 03:02:02.504
<i>You control everybody's
destiny? Chale.</i>

2547
03:02:05.412 --> 03:02:08.472
- No, you're right, man. I set Miklo up.
- No, I'm not.

2548
03:02:08.549 --> 03:02:11.950
I made him go after Spider.
I started the whole fuckin' thing.

2549
03:02:12.019 --> 03:02:14.647
Relax, ese.

2550
03:02:14.721 --> 03:02:17.588
- Your back wouldn't be all fucked up.

2551
03:02:17.658 --> 03:02:21.355
- Miklo wouldn't be in prison. He'd still have his leg.
- Hey, I forgive you, ese.

2552
03:02:21.428 --> 03:02:23.794
I don't want
your forgiveness, man!

2553
03:02:25.833 --> 03:02:30.133
You know, that's your fuckin' problem,
ese. You can't forgive yourself.

2554
03:02:33.006 --> 03:02:35.770
You need that guilt.
It's what keeps you going.

2555
03:02:35.843 --> 03:02:40.109
Hey, I know, bro. I fed mine
through a needle for ten years.

2556
03:02:43.550 --> 03:02:46.951
<i>And that guero up there, hating
his own fuckin' white skin?</i>

2557
03:02:47.020 --> 03:02:49.682
Shit, he's got it worse
than both of us.

2558
03:02:52.392 --> 03:02:56.954
<i>You gotta cut it loose, carnal.
It's fucking poison!</i>

2559
03:02:58.565 --> 03:03:00.692
That's who we are.

2560
03:03:00.767 --> 03:03:04.635
<i>Three vatos locos
full of carnalismo,</i>

2561
03:03:04.705 --> 03:03:07.572
trying to survive
in a fuckin' war zone.

2562
03:03:07.641 --> 03:03:13.307
<i>But what I know now, bro, is that I need
my familia to do it. We all do.</i>

2563
03:03:15.782 --> 03:03:19.513
<i>Even you, ç pinche jura!
Badass cop.</i>

2564
03:03:19.586 --> 03:03:22.111
Hey, don't back away,
vato.

2565
03:03:22.189 --> 03:03:25.590
<i>Life's a risk, carnal.
Remember? You said it yourself.</i>

2566
03:03:25.659 --> 03:03:29.026
<i>Ç Pues orale!
Step into the ring and throw down, ese.</i>

2567
03:03:29.096 --> 03:03:32.691
You a badass?
Take care of business, homes.

2568
03:03:32.766 --> 03:03:35.064
<i>Ç Caiga, puto!</i>

2569
03:03:35.135 --> 03:03:38.036
'Cause we're
from East Los, ese!

2570
03:03:39.206 --> 03:03:42.642
We come out chased
by hounds! Huh?

2571
03:03:44.878 --> 03:03:49.645
<i>Round and round we go,
wearing a pinche rabbit's foot for luck.</i>

2572
03:03:49.716 --> 03:03:51.809
<i>Just ahead of the fuckin'
hounds. ç Qu'iubo!</i>

2573
03:03:51.885 --> 03:03:54.319
- Ow!
- Yeah!

2574
03:03:54.388 --> 03:03:58.415
<i>Ç Que vida es!
Que loca vida, homes.</i>

2575
03:04:03.330 --> 03:04:05.992
<i>¿Pero sabes que, ese?</i>

2576
03:04:06.066 --> 03:04:09.160
<i>-
- Hey.</i>

2577
03:04:09.236 --> 03:04:13.832
We got something better
than a rabbit's foot, homes.

2578
03:04:13.907 --> 03:04:16.705
<i>We've got familia!</i>

2579
03:04:19.112 --> 03:04:21.171
<i>Raza, huey.</i>

2580
03:04:30.390 --> 03:04:33.848
Hmm? You know
what I'm saying, ese?

2581
03:04:33.927 --> 03:04:36.020
<i>Crees mucho,
Gallo Negro.</i>

2582
03:04:36.096 --> 03:04:39.122
You may be bad, but you
can't dance like Smooth Cruz.

2583
03:04:39.199 --> 03:04:41.099
<i>Ç Orale!
Yo y tu, ese.</i>

2584
03:04:41.168 --> 03:04:44.831
Oh, I see now.
I remember you, vato.

2585
03:04:44.905 --> 03:04:46.964
<i>- Ç Ah! Ç Ay, ay, ay!
- El Gallo Negro, vato.</i>

2586
03:04:47.040 --> 03:04:49.838
<i>- I'm a lover, not a fighter, man.
- Oh, si.</i>

2587
03:04:49.910 --> 03:04:53.004
<i>Simon. El merengue
at the Tender Trap '72.</i>

2588
03:04:53.080 --> 03:04:56.743
<i>- Rucas got their hearts broke and I kicked your ass. Pow! Pow!
- Shit!</i>

2589
03:04:56.817 --> 03:04:58.717
Shit, man, I was breakin'
hearts and faces, vato.

2590
03:04:58.785 --> 03:05:02.949
<i> ç Oh, si! Bullshit!
You still can't dance, ese!</i>

2591
03:05:03.023 --> 03:05:06.151
<i>You still can't dance.
¿Yque, loco?</i>

2592
03:05:06.226 --> 03:05:09.093
<i>Yeah, but you can learn, ese.
I'll teach you. Simon.</i>

2593
03:05:09.162 --> 03:05:12.154
'Cause it ain't ever over,
homes. Never!

2594
03:05:12.232 --> 03:05:14.996
<i>Bailamos hasta que
nos morimos, ese.</i>

2595
03:05:15.068 --> 03:05:17.093
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>
