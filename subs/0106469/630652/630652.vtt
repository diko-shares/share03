00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.006
What's the difference
between East LA and LA?

2
00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:49.080
- It's a different country.
- Hope it works better than in Vegas.

3
00:01:49.247 --> 00:01:50.646
It's got to. It's home.

4
00:02:00.927 --> 00:02:08.515
- There's nothing like this in Vegas.
- I dreamed of these for 1 8 months.

5
00:02:08.687 --> 00:02:10.518
1 8 months!

6
00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:14.680
Say hello to your mother.
Stay out of trouble!

7
00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:48.361
Jesse! I'm going to need a trim, homes.

8
00:03:21.687 --> 00:03:25.805
<i>Miklo, tell those wetbacks to step on it
or I won't pay them.</i>

9
00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:28.003
<i>- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.</i>

10
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:30.476
<i>Get moving.
I got more trucks coming.</i>

11
00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:32.239
<i>You ordered too much.</i>

12
00:03:32.407 --> 00:03:35.319
<i>1,500 bucks of mud.
Tell 'em to do it or they pay.</i>

13
00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:37.318
<i>Tell 'em yourself.</i>

14
00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:40.399
<i>Don't take a Mexican's side
over your father.</i>

15
00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:44.640
<i>- Fuck you!
- Ungrateful punk. I kept you outta jail.</i>

16
00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:48.117
<i>Work with them.
I'll get a man to run this crew.</i>

17
00:03:48.287 --> 00:03:50.005
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

18
00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:54.319
<i>Find yourself another slave, Dad!
I'm goin'home!</i>

19
00:03:54.487 --> 00:03:57.877
<i>You're fired!
I'll call your probation officer!</i>

20
00:03:58.847 --> 00:04:02.840
I wish I could've seen your father's face.

21
00:04:05.727 --> 00:04:08.878
<i>You beat him up. Ay, Dios mío.</i>

22
00:04:10.607 --> 00:04:13.599
Miklo, he'll kill me if he fiinds you here.

23
00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:16.804
He won't touch you again, Mama.

24
00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:20.642
<i>I know that cabrón. He'll turn you in.</i>

25
00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:23.275
Miklo. Help me. Do me up.

26
00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:29.483
If the judge knows you're here, he'll
stop my cheque. I need that money.

27
00:04:29.687 --> 00:04:31.086
Cold hands!

28
00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:36.486
Mommy, in six little days... Bingo!
I'm home free.

29
00:04:36.647 --> 00:04:40.162
What's this bingo?
What happens in six days?

30
00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:42.966
<i>Mi cumpleanos. June 2 8th.</i>

31
00:04:43.127 --> 00:04:47.006
My birthday, remember?
I'll be off probation.

32
00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:50.239
A birthday. Ooh, eighteen.

33
00:04:50.407 --> 00:04:53.126
<i>Qué macho, qué guapo!</i>

34
00:04:53.807 --> 00:04:57.800
<i>To me you're always going
to be my little chavalito.</i>

35
00:05:00.047 --> 00:05:02.641
I'm late. Beto hates to wait.

36
00:05:02.807 --> 00:05:07.483
Miklo, you can stay with
Aunt Dolores, huh? We'll drop you.

37
00:05:18.647 --> 00:05:20.319
Dolores.

38
00:05:22.047 --> 00:05:25.164
Dolores! Say ""hi'' to your nephew.

39
00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:28.241
My little blond one!

40
00:05:29.487 --> 00:05:33.526
<i>Ay, mijo. So good to see you.</i>

41
00:05:40.287 --> 00:05:42.118
You're so tall.

42
00:05:43.767 --> 00:05:46.565
- How long are you here?
- For good.

43
00:05:46.727 --> 00:05:48.126
Your probation's over?

44
00:05:48.287 --> 00:05:51.040
No, he's got a birthday coming up.

45
00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:53.482
Look... I gotta go.

46
00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:55.558
Miklo's gonna stay with you, OK?

47
00:05:55.727 --> 00:05:59.276
- Why?
- Because you have much more room.

48
00:05:59.447 --> 00:06:01.085
<i>I love you, nino.</i>

49
00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:06.442
You're my sister,
but I'm tired of taking care of you.

50
00:06:06.607 --> 00:06:10.395
<i>I can't live like you.
Your life would drive me crazy.</i>

51
00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:13.479
<i>Órale, the Pillsbury doughboy's
back in town.</i>

52
00:06:13.647 --> 00:06:15.638
Back for good.

53
00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:18.560
Thought you was never coming back.

54
00:06:18.727 --> 00:06:20.922
I always come back to East Los.

55
00:06:21.087 --> 00:06:24.159
Couldn't hang
with your white-boy daddy?

56
00:06:24.327 --> 00:06:28.525
Paco, Miklo's gonna be staying
with us a while. Make room for him.

57
00:06:28.687 --> 00:06:31.326
<i>Chale! Only a woman
shares my bed and TV.</i>

58
00:06:31.487 --> 00:06:33.603
<i>This puto stays in the garage.</i>

59
00:06:33.767 --> 00:06:35.166
Oh, yeah?

60
00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:41.235
<i>You know what, Mr... ""Chale'' ?
You're not the rooster here.</i>

61
00:06:41.407 --> 00:06:44.763
<i>This is my house. Me entiendes?</i>

62
00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:48.727
Miklo's your cousin.

63
00:06:50.927 --> 00:06:55.921
Take this bill to Mano and tell him
to pay it this afternoon.

64
00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:01.403
Keep the blankets over your head

65
00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:04.798
or your fluorescent skin
gonna keep me awake.

66
00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:07.726
<i>Check out this ""Three P'', ése.</i>

67
00:07:07.887 --> 00:07:12.483
<i>Since when do we let Tres Puntos
get away with that shit, homes?</i>

68
00:07:12.647 --> 00:07:15.878
Three P are just paint sniffers
that sneak in at night.

69
00:07:16.047 --> 00:07:19.483
<i>- They don't know about shit, ése.
- They are shit, ése.</i>

70
00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:23.845
- Why the fuck you come back?
- 'Cause you owe me fiive bucks.

71
00:07:24.007 --> 00:07:26.919
I came back to collect it...with interest!

72
00:07:27.207 --> 00:07:29.675
I'm gonna kick your ass, Milkweed.

73
00:07:29.847 --> 00:07:32.236
Come on,Jolly Green Giant!

74
00:07:41.847 --> 00:07:47.604
<i>Órale, mijo. This is Quetzalcoatl,
the great Aztec poet king.</i>

75
00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:52.716
He ruled the kingdom of Aztlán
that went from Mexico to Califas.

76
00:07:52.887 --> 00:07:56.004
<i>- Sexy mamasota!
- Pay attention, pelao.</i>

77
00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:57.885
I'll teach you about Aztlán

78
00:07:58.047 --> 00:08:03.246
<i>'cause this vato' s coming back to
reclaim the raza 's kingdom. Watcha!</i>

79
00:08:03.407 --> 00:08:09.403
<i>- Pero, why you put my initials on it?
- Because we did it together, ése.</i>

80
00:08:18.847 --> 00:08:23.602
<i>Chale, ése, you can't sneak up on us
with feathered watchdogs on duty.</i>

81
00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:28.238
<i>El Gallo Negro looks pretty mean, ése.
I'll put some feria on him.</i>

82
00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:33.762
<i>- Órale, watcha! El Miklo!
- Crucito!</i>

83
00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:37.283
What's happening?
When d'you parachute in, Milkweed?

84
00:08:37.447 --> 00:08:41.201
<i>- Today, from Vegas.
- High roller, o qué?</i>

85
00:08:43.807 --> 00:08:46.924
<i>- Miklo.
- Hola, tío Mano.</i>

86
00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:50.278
What you doing here?
How's your father?

87
00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:53.041
<i>- He's...he's OK.
- Your jefita?</i>

88
00:08:53.487 --> 00:08:56.320
My mom wants you to pay that.

89
00:08:56.487 --> 00:08:59.285
When you gonna pay your share?

90
00:08:59.447 --> 00:09:04.441
<i>Chale. I'm on the
Cal Mart Pay-As-You-Can Plan.</i>

91
00:09:06.327 --> 00:09:10.445
What about the Corps?
Recruiter Bentley's waiting for you.

92
00:09:10.607 --> 00:09:14.077
I won't take orders from
a jar-head like you. Forget it.

93
00:09:14.247 --> 00:09:17.284
You're my stepfather,
not my commanding offiicer.

94
00:09:17.447 --> 00:09:22.316
As long as you eat and sleep
in my house, don't talk to me like that!

95
00:09:22.487 --> 00:09:24.523
Show respect.

96
00:09:28.727 --> 00:09:32.117
<i>- Venga, mijo.
- I wanna stay with Cruz.</i>

97
00:09:32.287 --> 00:09:34.926
- Have you done your homework?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:35.087 --> 00:09:36.600
In the truck.

99
00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:44.839
Take it easy on Mano.
He just wants you to work.

100
00:09:45.007 --> 00:09:48.477
He's your dad, not mine.
Let him tell you what to do.

101
00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:51.878
<i>- Don't mad-dog me.
- So does that ranfla burn?</i>

102
00:09:52.047 --> 00:09:54.880
- It's a customer's ride.
- That's bullshit.

103
00:09:55.047 --> 00:09:58.596
<i>- Where you wanna go, Vegas, vato?
- El Pino.</i>

104
00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:06.679
That tree is East Los to me.

105
00:10:06.847 --> 00:10:08.439
It's good to be home.

106
00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:13.635
<i>Que no? My paintings
made it to the fiinals.</i>

107
00:10:13.807 --> 00:10:18.927
<i>- You really made it?
- Sí, mon, I'm still in.</i>

108
00:10:19.087 --> 00:10:23.160
- You'll win. You're the best.
- Not bad for a Chicano, eh?

109
00:10:26.847 --> 00:10:29.486
You still have your quills and inks?

110
00:10:29.647 --> 00:10:34.402
Get down,James Brown.
Put the needle in. I want my VL tattoo.

111
00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:38.355
<i>Hey, look in the mirror, güero.
Does it snow in LA?</i>

112
00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:42.918
<i>Does a white boy get a VL placazo?
No, he don't.</i>

113
00:10:43.087 --> 00:10:45.647
I'd have one if I had stayed.

114
00:10:45.807 --> 00:10:49.686
You wouldn't have shit, Milkweed.
It don't wash off.

115
00:10:49.847 --> 00:10:54.557
First sign of trouble you'll run back
to your white-boy daddy in Vegas.

116
00:10:55.967 --> 00:10:59.960
Wait till your number's called.
You'll get one.

117
00:11:03.207 --> 00:11:04.606
The cops! The cops!

118
00:11:06.927 --> 00:11:09.680
Fuck, man, I'm on probation.

119
00:11:09.847 --> 00:11:13.635
<i>- Ponte trucha.
- Pinchejuras, always fucking with me.</i>

120
00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:15.923
Hello, Offiicer!

121
00:11:16.087 --> 00:11:19.397
What seems to be the problem, sir?

122
00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:23.321
- Bumper clearance must be 1 0 inches.
- Oh, really?

123
00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:27.639
You in the car. Registration? Licence?

124
00:11:31.647 --> 00:11:35.003
You do this to people in Beverly Hills?

125
00:11:35.167 --> 00:11:37.886
Take off the glasses, please.

126
00:11:43.407 --> 00:11:47.366
You look familiar. You got a record?

127
00:11:47.527 --> 00:11:53.238
Yes, sir. He's got a great record.
The Black Rooster. Thirteen KOs.

128
00:11:53.407 --> 00:11:58.083
<i>Paco Aguilar, El Gallo Negro.
He's got a great right uppercut.</i>

129
00:11:58.247 --> 00:12:01.444
You used to train at the boys' club.

130
00:12:01.607 --> 00:12:03.677
Second division, Golden Gloves.

131
00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:08.363
- Till he broke his wrist.
- Yeah, I remember.

132
00:12:10.367 --> 00:12:14.155
- This your car?
- I just painted it, sir.

133
00:12:14.327 --> 00:12:16.045
What do you think?

134
00:12:20.687 --> 00:12:22.439
It looks nice.

135
00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:29.005
Listen...just raise the bumper
a few inches, OK?

136
00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:31.044
Like your uppercut.

137
00:12:32.407 --> 00:12:36.958
- Thank you. We will, sir.
- That's all right,Joe. Let's go.

138
00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:40.762
Without that badge
we'd see who hassles who, eh?

139
00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.839
- Shut the fuck up.
- Don't use my boxing any more.

140
00:12:44.007 --> 00:12:46.202
Don't be stupid. He saved our asses.

141
00:12:46.407 --> 00:12:50.036
I let you push my hat off,
but keep out of my business

142
00:12:50.207 --> 00:12:52.880
before I put you down, Milkweed.

143
00:12:53.047 --> 00:12:56.084
<i>Come on. Let's get this ranfla back.</i>

144
00:12:56.247 --> 00:12:58.238
You know it.

145
00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:04.085
- You hungry, Miklo?
- I got the munchies, homes.

146
00:13:04.247 --> 00:13:08.240
<i>When we get back to the cantón
we'll get some refino.</i>

147
00:13:19.727 --> 00:13:21.126
Come here.

148
00:13:25.767 --> 00:13:28.042
Check it out, homies.

149
00:13:29.327 --> 00:13:31.602
<i>- Who is it?
- Tres Puntos, ése.</i>

150
00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:35.806
<i>- In our own fucking alley.
- Chingada, Tres Puntos, ése.</i>

151
00:13:36.887 --> 00:13:41.005
- Fuckers crossed our lines.
- In dead man's land. Got a blade?

152
00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:44.045
-Just my dick in my pants.
- We gotta do something!

153
00:13:44.207 --> 00:13:49.281
We gotta do something?
Do something, rooster. You're ready.

154
00:13:49.447 --> 00:13:51.039
Shut the fuck up.

155
00:13:51.207 --> 00:13:55.200
<i>You want your placazo so bad?
Show me the colour inside you.</i>

156
00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:57.676
What the fuck's wrong with you?

157
00:13:57.847 --> 00:14:01.237
That's what I thought. Yellow.

158
00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:04.763
- Watch me,Jolly Green Giant!
- Hey, kamikaze!

159
00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:11.276
<i>Miklo, wait! Hey, pinche coco, man.
This ain't no pinche card game, ése.</i>

160
00:14:11.447 --> 00:14:13.438
Hey, life's a risk.

161
00:14:15.767 --> 00:14:18.759
<i>What the fuck's he doing, ése?</i>

162
00:14:20.127 --> 00:14:23.005
<i>Watcha, watcha!
Milkweed's got some balls.</i>

163
00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:25.761
He's gonna start some trouble.

164
00:14:32.527 --> 00:14:37.362
<i>- Hurry up, ése.
- Why? You got a date?</i>

165
00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:39.358
Let the homeboy get down.

166
00:14:39.527 --> 00:14:43.361
<i>Fuck these punks.
I'm taking over this barrio.</i>

167
00:14:43.527 --> 00:14:46.917
<i>Get down, demon.
Throw that puto sign on these punks.</i>

168
00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:50.443
They can't bust a grape.
They can't kick no dust.

169
00:14:52.487 --> 00:14:54.205
Shit!

170
00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:55.925
<i>Viva Vatos Locos!</i>

171
00:14:56.087 --> 00:14:59.124
I'm gonna fuck you up,
you motherfucker!

172
00:14:59.287 --> 00:15:01.164
Get in the car!

173
00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:15.600
Spider! Paint our wall,
we'll paint your ass.

174
00:15:15.767 --> 00:15:18.076
Why did you bust up our ride, punk?

175
00:15:18.247 --> 00:15:22.638
<i>Fuck you, Candelaria,
we're taking over this barrio!</i>

176
00:15:24.127 --> 00:15:27.597
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
pleasure to announce the winners

177
00:15:27.767 --> 00:15:31.157
of the Los Angeles Schools
Annual Art Competition.

178
00:15:31.327 --> 00:15:36.082
The fiirst is from Lincoln High School,
Cruz Candelaria.

179
00:15:37.007 --> 00:15:39.202
Come up here, Cruz.

180
00:15:47.927 --> 00:15:51.237
Well, here's your plaque.
Your Award of Honour.

181
00:15:51.407 --> 00:15:56.686
Much more important than this plaque,
however, I want to give you this.

182
00:15:56.847 --> 00:16:00.203
Your scholarship
from the LA College of Design.

183
00:16:00.367 --> 00:16:04.155
May you have tremendous success
in the future.

184
00:16:10.927 --> 00:16:15.682
<i>I want to thank especially mi abuelito...
my grandfather,</i>

185
00:16:15.847 --> 00:16:20.557
my father, my step-mum, Dolores,
who I love very much,

186
00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:22.365
<i>y los Vatos Locos.</i>

187
00:16:23.807 --> 00:16:26.275
<i>Vivan los Vatos Locos!</i>

188
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.126
<i>Deeper, ése. Make it last.</i>

189
00:16:34.287 --> 00:16:37.040
You want me to hold you down?

190
00:16:39.647 --> 00:16:44.767
Ay, ay, ay, ay! Don't cry, tough guy!

191
00:16:47.767 --> 00:16:52.204
Hey! You almost done?
I need you to stitch my khakies.

192
00:16:52.367 --> 00:16:56.758
This afternoon I got my prize.
Now you get yours.

193
00:16:57.847 --> 00:17:00.805
<i>Your blue eyes are turning brown, ése.</i>

194
00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:02.640
A deeper brown.

195
00:17:05.727 --> 00:17:07.126
<i>This is it, ése.</i>

196
00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:11.923
No return to Fantasyland where
the Cat never catches Tweetie Bird.

197
00:17:12.087 --> 00:17:14.157
<i>Chale, not here, ése.</i>

198
00:17:16.727 --> 00:17:18.877
Now you home with us...

199
00:17:19.047 --> 00:17:21.277
<i>...and defend the barrio.</i>

200
00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:25.723
<i>Vatos Locos for ever.</i>

201
00:17:25.967 --> 00:17:27.605
For ever.

202
00:17:30.607 --> 00:17:32.006
Baptise him.

203
00:17:51.607 --> 00:17:54.326
Now we're brothers till death.

204
00:17:56.247 --> 00:17:59.159
What you did was cool,
jacking up those jokers.

205
00:17:59.327 --> 00:18:02.000
<i>Cool, eh? Órale.</i>

206
00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:19.559
Nobody went to City Hall except
to pay fiines or bail someone out.

207
00:18:19.727 --> 00:18:21.922
Didn't I say he'd be important?

208
00:18:22.087 --> 00:18:26.319
<i>Sí. Crucito, you are
a lone stallion among mules.</i>

209
00:18:26.487 --> 00:18:31.686
You gonna become a legend
like Pancho Villa or Joaquín Murieta!

210
00:18:32.767 --> 00:18:34.439
To my father!

211
00:19:06.007 --> 00:19:08.999
This is my party,
so have a good time!

212
00:19:36.607 --> 00:19:39.121
Frankie, lend me your brother's GTO.

213
00:19:39.287 --> 00:19:40.879
<i>You think I'm a pendejo?</i>

214
00:19:41.047 --> 00:19:46.326
<i>Culero, see who paints that portrait
of your girl like you wanted me to?</i>

215
00:19:46.487 --> 00:19:47.886
You promised!

216
00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.637
Don't stain Frankie's back seat!

217
00:19:55.807 --> 00:19:59.880
<i>Or the front seat...
or anywhere else, vato!</i>

218
00:20:14.967 --> 00:20:17.276
Thought you'd be at this thing.

219
00:20:17.447 --> 00:20:20.007
Guess what?
I got Frankie's brother's GT.

220
00:20:20.167 --> 00:20:23.318
<i>- You did?
- Yeah, you know it, mija.</i>

221
00:20:23.487 --> 00:20:26.240
What's up?
You didn't show up at the thing.

222
00:20:26.407 --> 00:20:32.198
- You didn't tell me the time.
- Ah, let's dance.

223
00:20:48.367 --> 00:20:50.198
Let's get outta here.

224
00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:53.120
Hey, where's Cruz going. Come here!

225
00:20:54.967 --> 00:20:56.719
- Where you going?
- Come back.

226
00:20:56.887 --> 00:20:58.843
<i>- He's gonna open a present.
- Qué?</i>

227
00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:01.885
<i>Oh, sí, baboso, like you don't know...
Come on!</i>

228
00:21:02.047 --> 00:21:05.119
- I'll take you on.
- OK, put up your dukes.

229
00:21:05.287 --> 00:21:07.164
Hit him with the right!

230
00:21:09.927 --> 00:21:16.526
Bobby Chacón rises and dusts Chucho
Castillo. Picks him up, spins him around!

231
00:21:21.087 --> 00:21:23.840
<i>Your skin is so soft, morenita.</i>

232
00:21:29.407 --> 00:21:32.638
Will you paint my picture?

233
00:21:32.807 --> 00:21:34.638
<i>Te voy a pintar, mija.</i>

234
00:21:36.967 --> 00:21:40.084
Gonna paint you like an Aztec princess.

235
00:21:59.327 --> 00:22:01.887
Lookee, lookee. Can I have some?

236
00:22:02.047 --> 00:22:04.083
I like mine rare.

237
00:22:07.207 --> 00:22:08.845
What door do I pick?

238
00:22:09.007 --> 00:22:11.441
<i>Chingaos putos! This ain't your turf.</i>

239
00:22:11.607 --> 00:22:13.484
Get him out!

240
00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:15.886
No!

241
00:22:23.087 --> 00:22:26.159
Get back! Gimme a piece of that fucker!

242
00:22:27.007 --> 00:22:29.646
<i>Give this Vato Loco a joyride!</i>

243
00:22:36.087 --> 00:22:40.444
Let's teach them a lesson.
They ain't gonna fuck with us no more.

244
00:22:40.607 --> 00:22:44.441
<i>I'm taking this VL placa!
It's mine forever!</i>

245
00:22:46.487 --> 00:22:48.364
<i>What are you kids doing?</i>

246
00:22:49.407 --> 00:22:53.525
Get your ass back inside, Pops,
before I put you to sleep.

247
00:22:53.687 --> 00:22:55.917
Let's get the fuck outta here!
Let's party!

248
00:22:56.087 --> 00:22:59.636
<i>Tres Puntos own this barrio now!</i>

249
00:23:03.447 --> 00:23:05.915
My back. My back.

250
00:23:06.087 --> 00:23:08.282
<i>He's under anaesthetic.
I gotta go back.</i>

251
00:23:08.447 --> 00:23:13.157
Your son has multiple contusions,
a broken vertebra...very serious.

252
00:23:13.327 --> 00:23:15.318
When will we know he's OK?

253
00:23:15.487 --> 00:23:18.559
His spleen is injured.
I gotta stop the bleeding.

254
00:23:18.727 --> 00:23:25.405
If it's infected he'll be in a long time.
I'm sorry, it's all I can say now.

255
00:23:29.047 --> 00:23:32.642
<i>- What happened?
- Vámonos.</i>

256
00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:41.320
<i>Tres Puntos are gonna pay big time.</i>

257
00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:46.436
Shut up! They'll be waiting.
We'll hit 'em tomorrow morning.

258
00:23:46.607 --> 00:23:51.317
<i>- In the daylight? It's Sunday.
- They ain't going to Mass, pendejo.</i>

259
00:23:51.807 --> 00:23:54.321
Gimme that. You don't think I want 'em?

260
00:23:54.487 --> 00:23:58.241
I got some poison for a spider,
but tomorrow.

261
00:23:58.607 --> 00:24:01.485
<i>Hey, Paco. Cool it, ése.</i>

262
00:24:02.087 --> 00:24:03.645
What are you doing?

263
00:24:03.807 --> 00:24:07.038
- We can't let those punks...
- Get outta here!

264
00:24:07.207 --> 00:24:09.402
<i>- Who are you fiighting?
- Tres Puntos!</i>

265
00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:14.197
-Just yourselves!
- Don't talk to him like that.

266
00:24:14.367 --> 00:24:16.278
What you doing to my family?

267
00:24:16.447 --> 00:24:20.406
I'm your family!
We should take care of each other.

268
00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:22.762
We do nothing. We are nothing.

269
00:24:26.727 --> 00:24:28.445
Paco!

270
00:24:30.967 --> 00:24:33.435
<i>- No, Miklo...
- I'm sorry, tía.</i>

271
00:24:39.847 --> 00:24:41.917
<i>I like the country, ése!</i>

272
00:24:42.087 --> 00:24:46.603
<i>Hey, Coolaide, put that little jalapeno
back in your pants.</i>

273
00:24:46.767 --> 00:24:49.645
I was just walking our new territory.

274
00:24:49.807 --> 00:24:53.197
<i>We're the new landlords.
Vato Locos are fiinished.</i>

275
00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:55.597
Check out the new view, homies!

276
00:24:55.767 --> 00:24:58.679
I'm gonna build myself
a righteous pad here.

277
00:24:58.847 --> 00:25:01.998
Swimming pool,
white picket fence and shit.

278
00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:08.436
<i>Hey,Joker! You got a fiine mamacita.
Save me some!</i>

279
00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:11.167
- Come here.
- They're watching.

280
00:25:11.327 --> 00:25:13.602
- Come here, baby. Gimme some.
- No.

281
00:25:25.167 --> 00:25:27.044
Check it out, Spider.

282
00:25:43.367 --> 00:25:46.564
- It's the punk from the alley.
- Hey, Spider!

283
00:25:46.727 --> 00:25:49.036
He must be crazy to come here.

284
00:25:49.207 --> 00:25:53.598
<i>You cut my carnal!
I'm gonna jack you up, puto!</i>

285
00:26:06.687 --> 00:26:08.564
<i>Leave him alone, chavales!</i>

286
00:26:08.727 --> 00:26:10.524
What do you want to do?

287
00:26:10.687 --> 00:26:12.405
<i>Cálmenle, homies.</i>

288
00:26:12.567 --> 00:26:15.035
<i>Pay your dues to me, pinche mamón.</i>

289
00:26:15.207 --> 00:26:19.644
<i>You wanna throw down, puto?
Come and get some!</i>

290
00:26:19.807 --> 00:26:22.958
<i>Fuck you! Come and get
another placazo, badass!</i>

291
00:26:23.127 --> 00:26:25.960
I'm gonna cut your fucking eye out!

292
00:26:26.127 --> 00:26:31.759
<i>Then fuck these other vatos, ése!
Get up, Chuckie, get up!</i>

293
00:26:31.927 --> 00:26:35.442
<i>You fuck with my familia,
you gotta answer to me.</i>

294
00:26:35.607 --> 00:26:37.837
Come on! Toe to toe.

295
00:26:38.007 --> 00:26:39.998
Let's go, motherfucker!

296
00:26:41.887 --> 00:26:45.721
Let's see what kind of man
you are in daylight!

297
00:26:45.887 --> 00:26:49.880
- You scared of me?
- I'll catch you on the rebound, punk.

298
00:26:50.047 --> 00:26:53.437
<i>I'm gonna squash you
like the pinche bug you are!</i>

299
00:27:05.447 --> 00:27:06.766
Die, motherfucker!

300
00:27:10.647 --> 00:27:13.639
- Where you going? Get up.
- My rib's broken.

301
00:27:13.807 --> 00:27:17.720
<i>You ain't talking so bad now, ése.</i>

302
00:27:17.887 --> 00:27:20.401
- My rib!
- Wanna know how it feels?

303
00:27:20.567 --> 00:27:23.400
<i>Wanna know how it feels
to get stuck, puto?</i>

304
00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:25.797
Come on. Get up.

305
00:27:25.967 --> 00:27:27.559
Get up!

306
00:27:33.847 --> 00:27:35.997
What you running for, bitch?

307
00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:41.127
Shouldn't have done that to my brother.

308
00:27:41.287 --> 00:27:43.357
Know what I mean, jellybean?

309
00:27:43.527 --> 00:27:47.281
You wanna dance?
I know a tune called stick and cut.

310
00:27:48.887 --> 00:27:52.038
<i>You like dancing the stick and cut, ése?</i>

311
00:27:55.567 --> 00:27:58.559
<i>Miklo, hold him down, vato.</i>

312
00:27:59.447 --> 00:28:01.961
Look at him!

313
00:28:08.127 --> 00:28:10.687
<i>Property of Vatos Locos.</i>

314
00:28:11.687 --> 00:28:15.282
In case the dog catcher wants to know.

315
00:28:15.447 --> 00:28:17.278
Let him up, Milkweed.

316
00:28:18.687 --> 00:28:23.124
Hey,Jorge! We got him for Crucito!
He's marked for life!

317
00:28:23.287 --> 00:28:25.847
<i>- Hijo de la chingada.
- Paco, no!</i>

318
00:28:26.007 --> 00:28:27.486
Cruz is alive!

319
00:28:27.647 --> 00:28:32.675
<i>When the dog goes belly-up
he's fiinished, chale.</i>

320
00:28:32.847 --> 00:28:37.477
Yeah. Look at him.
The dog is belly-up.

321
00:28:38.567 --> 00:28:41.365
<i>Vivan los Vatos Locos!</i>

322
00:28:58.207 --> 00:29:00.118
<i>Let's go, ése!</i>

323
00:29:00.927 --> 00:29:02.360
Get in the car!

324
00:29:03.807 --> 00:29:05.957
<i>Die, pinche puto!</i>

325
00:29:21.767 --> 00:29:25.043
No! He's dead!

326
00:29:25.207 --> 00:29:26.799
Let's go home!

327
00:29:26.967 --> 00:29:30.926
- Shit!
- Where's he hit, man?

328
00:29:31.087 --> 00:29:33.806
Charlie, get his shirt off!

329
00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:42.919
Take it easy, Miklo.
Blood's everywhere. He's hurt bad.

330
00:29:43.087 --> 00:29:47.956
What the fuck are you doing?
Watch the corner!

331
00:29:48.127 --> 00:29:52.518
- You gonna kill us, Paco!
- Shut up! I gotta get him to hospital!

332
00:29:52.687 --> 00:29:54.837
No! People die there!

333
00:29:55.007 --> 00:29:57.999
What you worried about?
We're going to County.

334
00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:02.479
No! Let me out! I ain't going to hospital!

335
00:30:20.647 --> 00:30:22.478
Miklo, don't move!

336
00:30:22.647 --> 00:30:25.559
- The cops!
- Let's get outta here!

337
00:30:30.047 --> 00:30:32.481
- Oh, shit!
- Brace yourselves!

338
00:30:41.727 --> 00:30:43.445
Hang on!

339
00:30:43.927 --> 00:30:45.838
<i>He's still there, vato!</i>

340
00:30:47.287 --> 00:30:49.243
You cry, we die! Shut up!

341
00:30:49.687 --> 00:30:53.202
- Come on, homes. Step on it!
- He's gaining on us!

342
00:30:53.367 --> 00:30:57.963
<i>- They gonna beat us.
- They ain't doing shit! Watcha!</i>

343
00:31:16.087 --> 00:31:19.477
<i>- I showed that puto a Chicano U-turn!
- Puro ricochet!</i>

344
00:31:19.647 --> 00:31:24.163
<i>There's no jura in this town
that can do a Chicano U-turn!</i>

345
00:31:24.327 --> 00:31:25.885
Right on.

346
00:31:26.047 --> 00:31:31.280
<i>You just hang on tight, Miklo.
You gonna be free as a bird, vato.</i>

347
00:31:37.647 --> 00:31:40.241
<i>They're down on Floral!
Lose the cohetes!</i>

348
00:31:40.407 --> 00:31:44.082
- This is your poppie's shotgun.
- Throw it out!

349
00:31:44.247 --> 00:31:49.162
<i>Relax, es mi barrio, those pinche tourists
ain't gonna get nobody.</i>

350
00:31:49.327 --> 00:31:54.003
<i>Watcha. I gonna surprise those putos
on Indiana Street.</i>

351
00:31:58.247 --> 00:32:01.239
<i>Me lo pelo, tourists!</i>

352
00:32:02.847 --> 00:32:04.326
Look out!

353
00:32:12.447 --> 00:32:13.846
Go!

354
00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:18.125
Come on, Miklo, we gotta go.

355
00:32:20.207 --> 00:32:21.845
<i>Run, carnal, run.</i>

356
00:32:22.007 --> 00:32:26.523
<i>Vatos Locos for ever, carnal.
Let's go!</i>

357
00:32:26.687 --> 00:32:28.678
Come on!

358
00:32:29.207 --> 00:32:30.959
Shit!

359
00:32:35.807 --> 00:32:37.638
Show me your hands!

360
00:32:37.807 --> 00:32:40.321
My cousin is shot, homes, you gotta...

361
00:32:40.487 --> 00:32:43.206
- Get against the car!
- Help my cousin.

362
00:32:43.367 --> 00:32:45.039
- He's hurt.
- Stand up!

363
00:32:45.207 --> 00:32:47.323
- My cousin's shot.
- Don't move.

364
00:32:47.487 --> 00:32:51.560
Get up against the car.
Go! Move! Cuff'em.

365
00:32:51.727 --> 00:32:54.764
- Help him, he's...
- Get against the car.

366
00:32:54.927 --> 00:32:58.203
Paco! Paco!

367
00:33:00.487 --> 00:33:01.886
Paco!

368
00:33:22.527 --> 00:33:26.918
- Another fiish tank in from LA
- Yeah. Two down, one to go.

369
00:33:36.727 --> 00:33:41.517
Keep the pace.
Keep it going, man. Come on.

370
00:33:49.567 --> 00:33:52.035
C'mon, Ryder, one more time, man.

371
00:33:53.047 --> 00:33:55.720
Come on, man. Come on, Ryder.

372
00:33:56.967 --> 00:33:59.276
What the fuck we got here?

373
00:34:00.447 --> 00:34:02.677
Fucking fresh fiish, man.

374
00:34:02.847 --> 00:34:04.838
58-2 7 1 .

375
00:34:06.607 --> 00:34:08.563
Velka, D69-345.

376
00:34:11.087 --> 00:34:13.681
What you strolling for? Move it along.

377
00:34:14.047 --> 00:34:19.883
It's a long time since I had a West
Texan bitch. Wanna be my lady?

378
00:34:20.047 --> 00:34:23.562
Black Baby!
This bull's been crowded up a long time.

379
00:34:23.727 --> 00:34:25.877
I hope they put him in with me.

380
00:34:26.047 --> 00:34:29.164
Blue Eyes? Look what I got for you.

381
00:34:29.847 --> 00:34:33.965
You don't listen to anybody but me.
I'm the boss.

382
00:34:34.127 --> 00:34:37.961
Do you understand? Now, walk!

383
00:34:38.127 --> 00:34:40.800
Go through the door with the white sign.

384
00:34:40.967 --> 00:34:43.481
You'll be unchained,
then drop your drawers.

385
00:34:43.647 --> 00:34:46.366
And you'll be home.
Welcome to San Quentin.

386
00:34:48.767 --> 00:34:50.325
- Name?
- Cunny.

387
00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:53.597
- Number?
- I don't remember, sir.

388
00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:55.564
Learn it!

389
00:34:55.967 --> 00:34:58.561
Sweeney, B56-2 1 3.

390
00:35:01.327 --> 00:35:03.795
Robson, B2 8-90.

391
00:35:08.967 --> 00:35:11.197
Move it up. Let's go!

392
00:35:14.967 --> 00:35:18.277
- ...short hairs.
- Do anything you want.

393
00:35:18.447 --> 00:35:21.325
Look what Grandpa got you!

394
00:35:21.487 --> 00:35:23.717
- Doesn't he look good?
- Yeah.

395
00:35:25.727 --> 00:35:29.640
Hey, homes, that operation
makes you look good as new.

396
00:35:29.807 --> 00:35:32.719
- Wait till you see your surprise.
- Surprise?

397
00:35:32.887 --> 00:35:35.242
Just around the corner.

398
00:35:40.167 --> 00:35:42.158
Can you believe it?

399
00:35:43.967 --> 00:35:47.403
The Corps is making a man of him.

400
00:35:52.127 --> 00:35:55.517
<i>- Hey, carnal.
- How is it, champ?</i>

401
00:35:55.687 --> 00:35:58.838
- I'll walk from here.
- No, Cruz, no...

402
00:35:59.007 --> 00:36:02.363
<i>- You think you should?
- Oh, yeah, I'm... Amá?</i>

403
00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:06.202
Do me a favour.
Let me and Paco walk to the car.

404
00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:08.927
- Fine. We'll go.
- Can I go with you?

405
00:36:09.087 --> 00:36:14.081
I'll see you in a minute, OK?
Go with Mama.

406
00:36:19.847 --> 00:36:22.680
He doesn't look so good.

407
00:36:25.207 --> 00:36:27.198
You all right, man?

408
00:36:32.687 --> 00:36:34.678
<i>Pinche pierna, homes.</i>

409
00:36:37.167 --> 00:36:39.158
Let me do it.

410
00:36:43.727 --> 00:36:45.126
More.

411
00:36:46.207 --> 00:36:49.244
- There we...
- Those help you?

412
00:36:49.407 --> 00:36:53.923
They don't do shit.
Morphine's the ticket, though.

413
00:36:55.207 --> 00:37:00.645
Can't run, can't sleep,
can't play the accordion...

414
00:37:00.807 --> 00:37:04.720
<i>- Hope I can still paint, carnal.
- You will, carnal.</i>

415
00:37:04.887 --> 00:37:08.516
<i>A fucking marine, ése... Gee!</i>

416
00:37:08.687 --> 00:37:11.485
It was either this or jail.

417
00:37:11.647 --> 00:37:15.003
After boot camp,
I'm not sure it was a good deal.

418
00:37:15.167 --> 00:37:17.317
Lot better than Miklo, homes.

419
00:37:17.487 --> 00:37:19.762
Poor little Milkweed.

420
00:37:37.127 --> 00:37:39.846
Wanna buy some cigarettes?

421
00:37:40.367 --> 00:37:46.203
<i>- What's happening? How are you?
- Hola, pretty! You blond all over?</i>

422
00:37:46.367 --> 00:37:48.961
Get your hands off me, faggot!

423
00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:52.955
How his blue eyes light up
when he's mad...!

424
00:37:53.127 --> 00:37:55.243
Leave me alone, man.

425
00:37:55.407 --> 00:37:57.637
I'll kill you, bitch!

426
00:37:57.807 --> 00:38:00.719
Oh... You will?

427
00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:14.442
<i>Where you get that placa, Bo Peep?</i>

428
00:38:14.607 --> 00:38:16.757
I'm from Pico Aliso.

429
00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:20.397
Hey, Cinderella. Go fiind yourself a fella.

430
00:38:20.567 --> 00:38:23.161
You're on the clock
and midnight's coming.

431
00:38:23.327 --> 00:38:25.795
You got the wrong man.

432
00:38:25.967 --> 00:38:28.845
<i>What's your name, güero?</i>

433
00:38:29.007 --> 00:38:31.475
- Miklo Velka.
- I'm Popeye.

434
00:38:31.647 --> 00:38:33.638
You know my cousin,
Chuey Savedra?

435
00:38:33.807 --> 00:38:36.401
<i>El Chuey? He's my carnal!</i>

436
00:38:40.647 --> 00:38:43.161
<i>There's some vatos you should meet.</i>

437
00:38:45.047 --> 00:38:49.404
Most of these cons don't click.
They're just doing time.

438
00:38:49.567 --> 00:38:53.003
It's the gangs that run this place.

439
00:38:53.167 --> 00:38:58.685
See the black dude with the comb?
That's Bonafiide. He runs the BGA.

440
00:38:58.847 --> 00:39:00.644
The Black Guerrilla Army.

441
00:39:01.007 --> 00:39:05.842
Don't take nothing from him or you'll get
a Black Power comb through the heart.

442
00:39:07.487 --> 00:39:11.116
Those polar bears...
that's Aryan Vanguard.

443
00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:14.165
The AVers control the dope trade.

444
00:39:14.327 --> 00:39:17.399
They do killings,
anything for the right price.

445
00:39:17.567 --> 00:39:21.242
- I can't wait for my money.
- Why not take it out in trade?

446
00:39:21.407 --> 00:39:23.921
You always like Tinkerbell. She's fiine.

447
00:39:24.087 --> 00:39:27.204
You bet cash, you lose cash,
you pay cash.

448
00:39:27.367 --> 00:39:31.997
Pimpmobile. Soon. Or I'll have to hire
Red Ryder and his AV Boys.

449
00:39:32.167 --> 00:39:35.876
To cut some fat off your tongue.

450
00:39:36.047 --> 00:39:39.278
Or would you swap
for some of that tender white meat?

451
00:39:39.447 --> 00:39:42.723
You can pay your bets with that.

452
00:39:43.367 --> 00:39:45.119
<i>Suave, Al.</i>

453
00:39:46.327 --> 00:39:51.526
I'll pay you what I owe, but don't
scare me with your AV insurance policy.

454
00:39:51.687 --> 00:39:57.796
I got a policy with Ryder, too.
He won't mess with a good customer.

455
00:39:57.967 --> 00:40:03.963
Since business is so good, I'll raise
the rent on both you lame-ass fucks.

456
00:40:07.047 --> 00:40:08.799
Fuck him.

457
00:40:13.207 --> 00:40:16.005
Just two, it's over.

458
00:40:20.327 --> 00:40:22.682
Why let him disrespect you like that?

459
00:40:22.847 --> 00:40:25.759
- Take it easy.
- You wreck it for the others.

460
00:40:25.927 --> 00:40:30.398
<i>I'm just showing this homeboy around.
It's Miklo from my barrio.</i>

461
00:40:30.567 --> 00:40:33.843
You're the sucker that dusted Spider?

462
00:40:34.007 --> 00:40:37.443
If it's a rep you're looking for, killer...

463
00:40:38.247 --> 00:40:41.000
...then I'm the man you want.

464
00:40:41.607 --> 00:40:46.158
<i>Mira. Tres Puntos like Spider...
Oh, I'm the bogeyman.</i>

465
00:40:46.327 --> 00:40:49.000
He pissed in his pants.

466
00:40:53.167 --> 00:40:56.318
- Come on.
- Get out or I'll make you my bitch.

467
00:40:56.487 --> 00:41:01.197
<i>- He's Tres Puntos, ése.
- That's street bullshit, ése.</i>

468
00:41:01.367 --> 00:41:03.119
It's different in a joint.

469
00:41:03.287 --> 00:41:07.439
We click together for power
to protect ourselves.

470
00:41:07.647 --> 00:41:11.686
So anyone strong enough
to stand with La Onda is OK.

471
00:41:11.847 --> 00:41:14.315
- What's that?
- Don't ask.

472
00:41:27.127 --> 00:41:31.200
- There's smokes for you.
- I don't smoke cigarettes.

473
00:41:31.367 --> 00:41:33.085
That's like cash.

474
00:41:33.247 --> 00:41:37.638
- Got something else. Some ju-ju weed.
- I smoke that.

475
00:41:37.807 --> 00:41:40.002
Can I keep you under my wing?

476
00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:42.078
- I'll take care of you.
- OK.

477
00:41:42.247 --> 00:41:44.238
We're homeboys, right?

478
00:41:53.927 --> 00:41:55.997
White bitch,
gimme some chon-chon!

479
00:41:56.167 --> 00:41:59.682
- Stay away from me.
- Nothing's for free here.

480
00:42:02.647 --> 00:42:04.399
OK.

481
00:42:04.567 --> 00:42:07.365
That's right. Give it up.

482
00:42:11.247 --> 00:42:13.203
Want it the hard way?

483
00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:17.360
<i>You want me to rape you, puto?</i>

484
00:42:19.607 --> 00:42:22.724
<i>Let's see the colour of your blood,
gabacho.</i>

485
00:42:33.727 --> 00:42:39.438
<i>I'm gonna cut that fucking placa off you.
You ain't no Vato Loco.</i>

486
00:42:43.087 --> 00:42:44.679
Release him!

487
00:43:03.327 --> 00:43:05.397
Like I told you.

488
00:43:05.567 --> 00:43:08.559
Keep your business off this tier.

489
00:43:10.047 --> 00:43:12.880
<i>- Sí, mon.
- Pimping don't belong in La Onda.</i>

490
00:43:13.047 --> 00:43:15.402
We're better than that.

491
00:43:15.567 --> 00:43:17.922
My business is separate from La Onda.

492
00:43:18.087 --> 00:43:23.320
<i>- Madera. You're part of the clica.
- I was Onda before you were.</i>

493
00:43:24.447 --> 00:43:28.486
<i>Me entiendes?
Keep your whores in the rec room.</i>

494
00:43:28.927 --> 00:43:31.441
Keep that fucking thing in there.

495
00:43:47.567 --> 00:43:52.482
Come on, I got once-a-year special
on pork chops!

496
00:43:52.647 --> 00:43:57.277
This shit will make you impotent,
but you ain't going to no prom.

497
00:43:57.447 --> 00:43:59.722
Eat up, folks. Eat up.

498
00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:03.243
Shit, man. That's just fat.
Gimme another chop.

499
00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:07.116
I'm afraid not,
unless you got a carton of smokes...

500
00:44:07.287 --> 00:44:10.757
- Motherfucker!
- Allah is blushing.

501
00:44:10.927 --> 00:44:15.125
- I ain't no Muslim.
- How about a wager on the game?

502
00:44:15.287 --> 00:44:17.721
Your odds stink. I want another chop.

503
00:44:17.887 --> 00:44:21.596
Move on before I carpet my cell
with your black skin.

504
00:44:21.767 --> 00:44:23.678
What's the hold-up?

505
00:44:23.847 --> 00:44:26.077
Johnson, move it!

506
00:44:27.687 --> 00:44:29.882
Punk-ass motherfucker!

507
00:44:30.047 --> 00:44:33.198
All the rest of you,
get 'em while we got 'em.

508
00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:37.200
There's your chop. You happy now?

509
00:44:37.367 --> 00:44:43.044
Now for my brown brother.
Sorry, no tortilla.

510
00:44:43.207 --> 00:44:47.439
Wait. There's a ray of sunshine
in all that darkness.

511
00:44:47.607 --> 00:44:50.405
Come up here, sweetness.

512
00:44:52.847 --> 00:44:58.240
- You're keeping these beaners waiting.
- Move it, white boy!

513
00:44:58.407 --> 00:45:02.116
- What's the hold-up?
- It's OK, Sarge, he was out of line.

514
00:45:03.607 --> 00:45:06.565
Gimme your tray, homes.

515
00:45:08.847 --> 00:45:12.078
You're catching a ride on the wrong train.

516
00:45:13.487 --> 00:45:16.160
You oughta be ahead
of those jungle bunnies.

517
00:45:16.327 --> 00:45:22.038
- I take no free tickets on no one's train.
- You take a ticket or get run over.

518
00:45:22.207 --> 00:45:27.725
It's better to ride up front, fiirst class,
with the white folks.

519
00:45:29.007 --> 00:45:31.601
Know what I mean?

520
00:45:34.207 --> 00:45:36.516
Flirt on your own time, Albert.

521
00:45:36.687 --> 00:45:38.598
She's jealous.

522
00:45:40.047 --> 00:45:42.481
- Where's my chop?
- No more.

523
00:45:42.647 --> 00:45:47.198
<i>- I want my fucking chop, puerco.
- Be courteous. We've run out.</i>

524
00:45:48.127 --> 00:45:50.243
I know you got more back there.

525
00:45:50.407 --> 00:45:53.205
One of the kitchen detail
may sell you one.

526
00:45:53.367 --> 00:45:58.043
- I ain't buying what's mine.
- You know the trip, homes. No freebies.

527
00:45:58.207 --> 00:46:00.801
Hey, tough guy! You want a write-up?

528
00:46:00.967 --> 00:46:03.401
Maybe you wanna go to lock-up?

529
00:46:07.287 --> 00:46:10.404
Move it! We got ten minutes. Let's eat.

530
00:46:13.527 --> 00:46:17.440
You sold our meat.
You been doing that shit too long.

531
00:46:17.607 --> 00:46:22.362
We ran out. Move on, fly catcher.
There's hungry men behind you.

532
00:46:22.527 --> 00:46:26.805
I'll fold your bluffiing hand some day,
you motherfucker.

533
00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:30.562
In your dreams, Pedro,
in your dreams.

534
00:46:46.447 --> 00:46:50.281
Where the fuck you think
you're trespassing?

535
00:46:52.567 --> 00:46:55.035
- What?
- I thought you wanted it.

536
00:46:55.207 --> 00:46:57.721
- What?
- My chop.

537
00:47:02.807 --> 00:47:05.605
I don't want his pork chop.

538
00:47:10.367 --> 00:47:12.722
I want his life.

539
00:48:00.447 --> 00:48:05.805
<i>- What do you want, vato?
- I have to speak with El Mero Mero.</i>

540
00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:10.324
<i>Go play with the polar bears
or the mayates.</i>

541
00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:13.923
<i>- Here, it's estilo Toluca.
- What's Toluca?</i>

542
00:48:14.087 --> 00:48:16.043
It's the Aztec ball court,

543
00:48:16.207 --> 00:48:19.438
where you lose...you die.

544
00:48:21.647 --> 00:48:23.285
Want me to drop you, white boy?

545
00:48:23.687 --> 00:48:28.477
Go on, drop me. I ain't afraid to die.
Come on! Come on!

546
00:48:33.127 --> 00:48:36.199
It wouldn't happen
if you were here with Daddy.

547
00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:38.358
Fuck you.

548
00:48:57.567 --> 00:48:59.717
I want to join La Onda.

549
00:49:00.207 --> 00:49:02.516
<i>You speak Spanish, güero.</i>

550
00:49:02.687 --> 00:49:06.600
<i>- So do parrots.
- I'm in here for packing up a carnal.</i>

551
00:49:06.767 --> 00:49:11.921
<i>I killed a Tres Puntos who was gonna
take out my partner. Soy chicano.</i>

552
00:49:18.447 --> 00:49:22.042
Chicanos killing Chicanos
is what they want.

553
00:49:22.207 --> 00:49:28.157
Blacks and Chicanos killing each other.
That's how they run this place.

554
00:49:28.327 --> 00:49:32.161
Once we get together,
they don't run shit.

555
00:49:32.327 --> 00:49:35.080
You got a lot to learn
about being Chicano.

556
00:49:35.247 --> 00:49:38.319
The colour of my skin
shouldn't keep me out.

557
00:49:38.487 --> 00:49:40.682
White is the enemy.

558
00:49:40.847 --> 00:49:42.724
White's the system.

559
00:49:42.887 --> 00:49:45.242
You're stuck in the middle.

560
00:49:49.887 --> 00:49:54.199
All my life I've been kept out.
Know what that feels like?

561
00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:58.838
Knowing you're a Chicano and no one
accepts you 'cause your skin's white?

562
00:49:59.007 --> 00:50:01.567
My mom's as brown as you.

563
00:50:01.727 --> 00:50:05.515
My white dad tried to beat
every ounce of her outta me.

564
00:50:05.687 --> 00:50:09.839
But he couldn't do it.
Chicano's not a colour.

565
00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:12.646
It's the way you think and live.

566
00:50:12.807 --> 00:50:16.641
<i>And if you're willing
to give up your life for a carnal.</i>

567
00:50:18.367 --> 00:50:22.155
I'm here to do that. Use me. Use this.

568
00:50:24.927 --> 00:50:26.599
<i>How, güero?</i>

569
00:50:26.767 --> 00:50:30.476
You said everything's based on colour.

570
00:50:30.647 --> 00:50:34.526
I can go where you can't,
'cause I'm white on the outside.

571
00:50:34.687 --> 00:50:38.236
But I'm brown on the inside...
to the bones.

572
00:50:40.687 --> 00:50:44.475
The only way into La Onda
is to take on one of our enemies.

573
00:50:44.647 --> 00:50:51.086
<i>In your case, someone big we can't hit
without losing a lot of carnales.</i>

574
00:50:51.247 --> 00:50:54.000
<i>- Chale.
- Give me a chance.</i>

575
00:50:54.167 --> 00:50:56.522
Trust me.Just one chance.

576
00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:59.678
I'm ready.

577
00:51:01.487 --> 00:51:06.800
<i>Respect is everything, güero.
You ready to die for it?</i>

578
00:51:06.967 --> 00:51:08.958
We'll see.

579
00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:13.723
Blood in, blood out.

580
00:51:19.047 --> 00:51:21.356
You understand?

581
00:51:21.527 --> 00:51:23.006
Completely.

582
00:51:25.647 --> 00:51:31.279
Start breakfast at 4.30 a.m.
Dinner at two. You're on pots and pans.

583
00:51:31.447 --> 00:51:35.565
- With the niggers.
- Thanks! I'll take what I can.

584
00:51:35.727 --> 00:51:39.083
- Whatever you say.
- That's right, babycake.

585
00:51:39.247 --> 00:51:40.919
I knew you'd wise up.

586
00:51:41.087 --> 00:51:44.124
- That pimp can't do what I can.
- Sounds nice.

587
00:51:44.287 --> 00:51:48.678
Hey, Gil.
I got that protein powder for Ryder.

588
00:51:52.407 --> 00:51:55.956
See that? Learn to treat me right
and you get it all.

589
00:51:56.127 --> 00:52:00.484
Food, coffee, cigs, drugs...
C'mon over here.

590
00:52:00.647 --> 00:52:02.239
Hey, get outta here.

591
00:52:04.727 --> 00:52:08.766
It's off-limits to all but me and the staff.

592
00:52:09.407 --> 00:52:14.083
- Hey, you like that?
- That's nice.

593
00:52:14.927 --> 00:52:16.838
Yeah, so's this.

594
00:52:21.567 --> 00:52:25.003
- This where your goodies are?
- Some of'em.

595
00:52:28.807 --> 00:52:32.482
- Pinto beans.
- No pintos for you, baby.

596
00:52:32.647 --> 00:52:35.081
Nothing but Texas barbecue.

597
00:52:37.647 --> 00:52:41.037
- How about it, sweet cheeks?
-Just remember, Al.

598
00:52:41.207 --> 00:52:44.722
I fuck who I want, when I want.

599
00:52:44.887 --> 00:52:47.924
All right. Take it easy. It's all right.

600
00:52:48.087 --> 00:52:52.717
You treat me right...everything's
gonna be crimson and clover.

601
00:52:54.967 --> 00:52:59.722
Popeye tried to take it.
I almost bit his dick off!

602
00:53:00.967 --> 00:53:03.606
Well, I can wait, baby.

603
00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:06.759
That spic's a pig. Got no class.

604
00:53:06.927 --> 00:53:10.397
Just don't make Daddy wait too long.

605
00:53:10.567 --> 00:53:12.637
Come on now, come on.

606
00:53:38.047 --> 00:53:40.800
- You wild little bitch.
- It's just a sample.

607
00:53:40.967 --> 00:53:44.846
- I'm gonna fuck your brains out.
- When I'm ready, Al.

608
00:53:46.047 --> 00:53:48.003
When I'm ready.

609
00:54:04.247 --> 00:54:08.638
<i>Ay, mijo, the prices...
They're so high.</i>

610
00:54:08.807 --> 00:54:12.038
Prices mean nothing unless they sell.

611
00:54:12.207 --> 00:54:16.723
- I've been looking for you.
-Just saying goodbye to my family.

612
00:54:16.887 --> 00:54:20.562
<i>- Crucito, make us proud.
- You know it, apá.</i>

613
00:54:20.727 --> 00:54:24.436
Hey, Cruz. Buy me a low rider
when you're rich.

614
00:54:24.607 --> 00:54:26.040
Low rider!

615
00:54:28.407 --> 00:54:31.604
Come with me.
People want to meet you. Circulate.

616
00:54:31.767 --> 00:54:33.758
You're the artist.

617
00:54:34.607 --> 00:54:37.519
You make them look so noble. So...

618
00:54:37.687 --> 00:54:40.406
<i>...fuerte.</i>

619
00:54:40.567 --> 00:54:44.355
I paint what I see. You really like it, huh?

620
00:54:44.527 --> 00:54:48.281
I must take him to a press photo.
I'll bring him back.

621
00:54:48.447 --> 00:54:50.085
All right.

622
00:54:50.247 --> 00:54:52.078
Janis, what are you doing?

623
00:54:52.247 --> 00:54:55.284
- They were gonna buy...
- They're window shoppers.

624
00:54:55.447 --> 00:54:58.200
Tonight is strictly business.

625
00:54:58.367 --> 00:55:00.164
Yeah, so?

626
00:55:00.807 --> 00:55:04.800
<i>They went in.
How come they went in?</i>

627
00:55:04.967 --> 00:55:09.916
We both have a lot at stake.
Don't let them blow it.

628
00:55:10.087 --> 00:55:12.317
<i>Lo comprende?</i>

629
00:55:12.487 --> 00:55:16.241
Your names are not on the list.
It's invitation only.

630
00:55:16.407 --> 00:55:21.276
We don't need our names on a list.
That's my face up there.

631
00:55:21.447 --> 00:55:24.803
It doesn't matter.
Miss Weinstock has to okay it.

632
00:55:24.967 --> 00:55:30.200
<i>Enjoy yourselves.
There's my invitation, OK? Gracias.</i>

633
00:55:31.567 --> 00:55:34.718
- It's OK, Belinda, it's all right.
- It's OK, Belinda!

634
00:55:34.887 --> 00:55:37.720
<i>What's happening, Locos?</i>

635
00:55:38.567 --> 00:55:42.879
Crucito. Congratulations.
Come out for a taste.

636
00:55:43.047 --> 00:55:45.845
<i>Órale, Gilbert, in a minute, homes.</i>

637
00:55:46.007 --> 00:55:47.838
<i>Check out the carrucha.</i>

638
00:55:50.167 --> 00:55:53.398
Cruz Candelaria...
this is big time, homes.

639
00:55:53.567 --> 00:55:55.797
Why'd you bring that fool?

640
00:55:55.967 --> 00:55:59.437
<i>Hey, it's too bright in here, ése.
Too much white.</i>

641
00:55:59.607 --> 00:56:04.635
Hey, Crucito,
what happened to our invitation?

642
00:56:04.807 --> 00:56:08.117
<i>- Are you ashamed of Frankie?
- Sí.</i>

643
00:56:08.287 --> 00:56:11.120
I'm glad you came,
but why'd you bring Gilbert?

644
00:56:11.287 --> 00:56:15.678
He smells money from across town.
He came to help you spend it.

645
00:56:15.847 --> 00:56:20.159
Shit, I can't pay him now.
I only got ten bucks.

646
00:56:20.327 --> 00:56:23.683
- With those prices?
- I ain't sold nothing.

647
00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:26.964
<i>We should jack up
a few of these maricones.</i>

648
00:56:27.127 --> 00:56:31.917
- I got the guy in bell-bottoms.
- Be cool. I'm trying to hold it together.

649
00:56:32.087 --> 00:56:35.159
He wants payback,
then he'll give us credit.

650
00:56:35.327 --> 00:56:37.443
- Shh, quiet.
- No!

651
00:56:38.967 --> 00:56:42.676
<i>Relax. Here, have some pisto.</i>

652
00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:46.158
I'll see what I can do.

653
00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:51.751
- He'll take this price.
- I'm not negotiating. It's a steal.

654
00:56:51.916 --> 00:56:56.273
- He'll probably pass.
- That'll be his loss.

655
00:57:05.796 --> 00:57:08.549
Janis, can you help me
with a cash advance?

656
00:57:08.716 --> 00:57:12.868
- I've already given you three.
- I need some money.

657
00:57:13.036 --> 00:57:16.506
What use is a show
if I don't sell anything?

658
00:57:16.676 --> 00:57:22.865
Most of your paintings are already
reserved by important collectors.

659
00:57:23.036 --> 00:57:28.906
- What?
- You'll be sold out by the end of tonight.

660
00:57:29.076 --> 00:57:32.307
Sold out? All of it?

661
00:57:33.636 --> 00:57:36.434
Then why can't I get
some money tonight?

662
00:57:36.596 --> 00:57:39.827
Doesn't work that way.
The cheques go to the accountant.

663
00:57:39.996 --> 00:57:44.592
No, I need some money tonight,
you understand?

664
00:57:44.756 --> 00:57:48.635
Come on. I sold out, so I deserve some.

665
00:57:51.036 --> 00:57:55.314
You've a great career ahead of you.
Don't let it go in the garbage.

666
00:57:55.476 --> 00:57:58.036
Think about it
when you're getting high tonight.

667
00:57:58.196 --> 00:58:03.111
No Baptist sermons,Janis.
Strictly business, remember?

668
00:58:10.996 --> 00:58:12.714
Thank you.

669
00:58:13.956 --> 00:58:18.905
- I got a hot tip, Al. How's my credit?
- Ryder, your credit's as fiirm as...

670
00:58:19.076 --> 00:58:21.032
Don't be that-a-way.

671
00:58:21.196 --> 00:58:25.826
- Nothing like popping that cherry, eh?
- Red Ryder, your mouth...

672
00:58:25.996 --> 00:58:30.990
- Lakers won in overtime, Al.
- Give him a green 'un.

673
00:58:32.076 --> 00:58:34.954
Why do you always bet on LA teams?

674
00:58:35.116 --> 00:58:40.429
Keep paying up, Al.
Everything's gonna be just fiine.

675
00:58:41.876 --> 00:58:47.872
- She looks bow-legged to me.
- You'll always be runner-up, punk.

676
00:58:48.996 --> 00:58:52.227
<i>I'm still gonna cut
that VL placa off you, sissy.</i>

677
00:58:52.396 --> 00:58:58.073
Pancho, don't be a sore loser.
Get the fuck outta here.

678
00:59:02.636 --> 00:59:07.630
I don't want that greaser pimp
talking to you, understand?

679
00:59:09.276 --> 00:59:14.350
Tomorrow's your day.
Tonight you must read the black book.

680
00:59:20.716 --> 00:59:22.672
these are the killing points.

681
00:59:22.836 --> 00:59:25.634
The arrows show
where a man can be killed.

682
00:59:25.796 --> 00:59:30.950
Hit a man here and
he dies slowly and painfully.

683
00:59:31.116 --> 00:59:36.474
Hit a man here
and he dies instantly.

684
00:59:42.596 --> 00:59:47.875
When you get to the kitchen,
look in the largest stockpot.

685
00:59:48.036 --> 00:59:50.152
Geronimo will be watching.

686
00:59:52.876 --> 00:59:58.030
If you're successful, you're one of us.
If you fail, you die.

687
01:00:11.156 --> 01:00:16.150
Hey, no, I got that, Howie.
Let a real man do the job.

688
01:00:29.116 --> 01:00:33.553
All right, you slaves!
I want them clean in one hour.

689
01:00:33.716 --> 01:00:35.468
You! Get to work.

690
01:01:22.196 --> 01:01:24.630
It's so hot!

691
01:01:27.156 --> 01:01:29.306
He burned my back on purpose!

692
01:01:29.876 --> 01:01:32.265
- It hurts.
- I can't do nothing.

693
01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:40.714
Medic's on his way.

694
01:02:12.516 --> 01:02:15.713
Hey! What the fuck are you doing here?

695
01:02:15.876 --> 01:02:18.754
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

696
01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:20.793
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

697
01:02:20.956 --> 01:02:24.835
- This room is off-limits.
- Shouldn't be in here, babycakes.

698
01:02:24.996 --> 01:02:27.066
- What do you want?
- Steel wool.

699
01:02:27.236 --> 01:02:32.913
You are fucking up, letting him in.
No one's meant to know.

700
01:02:33.076 --> 01:02:39.265
- He does what I say, Sergeant.
- I'm not risking it for some piece of ass.

701
01:02:39.436 --> 01:02:44.146
You get paid plenty for your risk,
right? Am I right?

702
01:02:47.796 --> 01:02:50.629
- Yeah, right.
- Then, get moving.

703
01:02:50.796 --> 01:02:52.388
You've lots of trips.

704
01:02:52.556 --> 01:02:56.151
Remember, I got a receipt
for every dollar you got.

705
01:02:56.316 --> 01:03:01.265
What the fuck you looking at?
Stand there and don't move.

706
01:03:01.436 --> 01:03:04.985
Cover that money!
How long to the parking lot?

707
01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:08.228
- Fifteen minutes.
- Get back here in ten.

708
01:03:08.396 --> 01:03:12.674
- Keep this door closed.
- Don't give me orders.

709
01:03:12.836 --> 01:03:18.706
Goddamn you. Don't ever come here.
Get the fuck outta here.

710
01:03:18.876 --> 01:03:26.464
You prick tease, swinging your little ass
around like you own the joint.

711
01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.389
Sorry, Al. I know I fucked up.

712
01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.308
Forgive me.

713
01:03:31.476 --> 01:03:33.671
I thought you were alone.

714
01:03:33.836 --> 01:03:35.667
- Don't hold it against me.
- Shut up!

715
01:03:35.836 --> 01:03:37.667
Please....

716
01:03:37.836 --> 01:03:40.714
Let me make it up to you.

717
01:03:40.876 --> 01:03:43.754
I won't hold back any more.

718
01:03:49.716 --> 01:03:53.470
We don't have much time. Come on.

719
01:03:54.196 --> 01:03:56.869
Let's get to it.

720
01:04:00.316 --> 01:04:01.954
Hurry up.

721
01:04:02.116 --> 01:04:04.994
- I'm gonna lick you clean.
- Do it, bitch.

722
01:04:05.156 --> 01:04:07.147
Lay back and enjoy it.

723
01:05:13.596 --> 01:05:16.713
- I'm all right. It was an accident.
- Shit!

724
01:05:16.876 --> 01:05:21.108
- I'm telling you, man.
- You affiiliated with La Onda?

725
01:05:21.276 --> 01:05:24.348
- What?
- Don't insult my intelligence.

726
01:05:24.516 --> 01:05:26.029
You're Onda, he's BGA.

727
01:05:26.196 --> 01:05:31.190
I know you're the gang coordinator,
but you're selling a wolf ticket.

728
01:05:41.916 --> 01:05:43.315
Shit.

729
01:05:43.476 --> 01:05:45.114
Don't bullshit me.

730
01:06:05.956 --> 01:06:08.948
Hell, I told you to keep the door...

731
01:06:15.396 --> 01:06:17.307
Fucking little shit.

732
01:06:20.036 --> 01:06:25.110
OK, gentlemen, it was an accident.
Get back to making breakfast.

733
01:06:30.836 --> 01:06:34.749
Man down! Let's go. Storage room.

734
01:06:43.076 --> 01:06:48.514
Goddamn it! Sergeant,
I want you to shake this place out.

735
01:06:48.676 --> 01:06:52.305
I want the IDs and background
on every man in here.

736
01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:58.028
I wanna know who did it.
Someone in here'll get 25 years.

737
01:06:58.196 --> 01:07:04.874
I wanna know who did it. No lunch hour,
no exercise, no rest room.

738
01:07:05.036 --> 01:07:08.551
Get outta there!
No nothing till I get some answers.

739
01:07:08.716 --> 01:07:12.504
Until I do, you won't see the light of day.

740
01:07:15.556 --> 01:07:21.108
Sergeant Devereaux!
I want you to strip-search these men.

741
01:07:22.996 --> 01:07:26.625
You'll get it! It's on its way!

742
01:07:28.196 --> 01:07:32.587
If I don't get that book and money back,
you're dead. Understand?

743
01:07:32.756 --> 01:07:39.912
Your name's in that book, Bob. If I don't
stay healthy, the warden will fiind it.

744
01:07:41.596 --> 01:07:43.791
- Hey, Bob.
- What?

745
01:07:43.956 --> 01:07:47.232
Can I get an extra dessert tomorrow?

746
01:07:52.516 --> 01:07:55.349
Shut the fuck up!

747
01:07:55.556 --> 01:07:58.514
- Whose are they?
- My brother's friend.

748
01:07:58.676 --> 01:08:04.194
- He won't say shit. He's asleep.
- You'll be in trouble if he wakes.

749
01:08:04.356 --> 01:08:06.028
All right! See you later.

750
01:08:06.196 --> 01:08:09.427
- He'll be pissed at you.
- No, I'll kick his ass.

751
01:08:16.836 --> 01:08:21.193
- Hey, Cruz...
- Hey, this ain't no playground.

752
01:08:21.356 --> 01:08:23.711
<i>Oye, pendejo, know how to knock?</i>

753
01:08:23.876 --> 01:08:28.666
- It's cool. I know what's up.
- It ain't cool. You don't know what's up.

754
01:08:28.836 --> 01:08:33.830
You better learn or you can't come here.
Understand?

755
01:08:33.996 --> 01:08:35.475
I'm sorry.

756
01:08:35.636 --> 01:08:38.708
Your place is great.
I wanna come back.

757
01:08:38.876 --> 01:08:45.873
<i>OK, carnalito, but you can't just barge in.
Go and watch TV until Mom comes.</i>

758
01:08:50.076 --> 01:08:55.150
Go upstairs and practise so you can
be a badass like Bobby Chacón.

759
01:08:55.316 --> 01:08:59.070
Tell Mom my back was hurting
so I had to take a nap.

760
01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:01.192
Yeah.

761
01:09:03.916 --> 01:09:10.310
<i>What's wrong with you? You can't
do that when my carnalito's around.</i>

762
01:09:11.516 --> 01:09:13.950
- It's cool.
- It ain't cool.

763
01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:19.270
Come on, Crucito. Come on down.

764
01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:24.472
This will cure your back pain, homes.

765
01:09:25.876 --> 01:09:32.145
Painting 22 masks is a drag.
I'm tired of this assembly line shit.

766
01:09:32.316 --> 01:09:35.308
It's money in the bank, Crucito.

767
01:09:38.876 --> 01:09:41.754
<i>Paint some rucas, homes.</i>

768
01:09:51.076 --> 01:09:52.907
Take the pain away.

769
01:09:53.796 --> 01:09:59.393
<i>Hey, paint some rucas naked.
Oh, man...</i>

770
01:09:59.556 --> 01:10:05.552
<i>Ése, I don't want to spend my life
decorating rich people's rooms.</i>

771
01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:09.953
<i>I wanna do something different, ése.</i>

772
01:10:12.756 --> 01:10:17.955
The way I see it, Crucito,

773
01:10:18.116 --> 01:10:24.464
<i>- you take the money and run, vato.
- Que no.</i>

774
01:10:25.836 --> 01:10:28.634
I'll paint 'em for you, eh?

775
01:10:33.076 --> 01:10:36.955
Fuck 'em, man, I'll paint what I feel.

776
01:11:04.716 --> 01:11:08.755
<i>This is your bautismo, güero.
We created La Onda.</i>

777
01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:10.747
The seven of us.

778
01:11:12.356 --> 01:11:14.950
This is the inner circle.

779
01:11:15.116 --> 01:11:19.314
<i>Every one is a capitan
and commands his own soldiers.</i>

780
01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:24.470
We all have an equal vote,
but I'm the elected spokesman.

781
01:11:24.636 --> 01:11:28.754
This is the last time
you will sit in this circle.

782
01:11:28.916 --> 01:11:32.033
You've proven yourself,
so we're admitting you into Onda.

783
01:11:32.196 --> 01:11:34.915
It's a commitment for life.

784
01:11:35.076 --> 01:11:40.309
As a soldier, you answer to this council
and carry out orders without question.

785
01:11:40.476 --> 01:11:43.593
Failure to do so is death.

786
01:11:46.756 --> 01:11:50.635
For 500 years we've suffered
the oppression of our race.

787
01:11:50.796 --> 01:11:54.027
But here, by organising ourselves,

788
01:11:54.196 --> 01:11:56.835
we're gonna stop this disaster.

789
01:11:56.996 --> 01:12:00.068
Because this land is ours.

790
01:12:00.236 --> 01:12:03.148
Blood for blood.

791
01:12:03.316 --> 01:12:07.787
Blood in, blood out.

792
01:12:23.796 --> 01:12:28.790
<i>Ay, mijo.
Please, somebody...Juanito.</i>

793
01:12:30.516 --> 01:12:31.915
God!

794
01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:38.032
Help! Somebody, please! Help! Help!

795
01:12:39.156 --> 01:12:40.555
Juanito...

796
01:12:42.356 --> 01:12:45.154
<i>- Ay, mijo....
- Amá, what's going on?</i>

797
01:12:45.316 --> 01:12:48.945
Don't touch him! Leave him alone.

798
01:12:52.276 --> 01:12:58.226
- You did this, you bastard!
- We gotta get outta here, Crucito.

799
01:12:58.396 --> 01:13:00.705
Please bring my baby back.

800
01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:04.471
There's nothing we can do.
Get outta here or we're fucked.

801
01:13:04.636 --> 01:13:06.945
OK? C'mon, please.

802
01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.630
-Juanito!
- Come on!

803
01:13:20.356 --> 01:13:23.792
""The Lord is my shepherd.
There is nothing I shall want.

804
01:13:23.956 --> 01:13:27.631
""Fresh and green are the pastures
where He gives me repose.

805
01:13:27.796 --> 01:13:32.665
""Near restful waters, He leads me
to revive my drooping spirit.

806
01:13:32.836 --> 01:13:36.795
""Goodness and kindness
shall follow me all the days of my life.

807
01:13:36.956 --> 01:13:41.472
""In the Lord's own house shall I dwell.
For ever and ever.''

808
01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:10.232
""Let us begin
in the name of the Father...''

809
01:14:10.796 --> 01:14:14.471
What do you want, traitor?

810
01:14:18.396 --> 01:14:20.626
Forgive me.

811
01:14:24.196 --> 01:14:25.948
Not now!

812
01:14:26.116 --> 01:14:28.311
Not ever!

813
01:14:28.476 --> 01:14:32.389
You are dead to me, like Juanito.

814
01:14:35.156 --> 01:14:36.874
Let us pray.

815
01:14:37.996 --> 01:14:41.784
""Lord Jesus Christ,
by your own three days in the tomb,

816
01:14:41.956 --> 01:14:46.347
""you allowed the graves of all
who believed in you to be made holy.

817
01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:50.429
""So you made the grave a sign of hope
that promises resurrection,

818
01:14:50.596 --> 01:14:53.713
""even as it claims our mortal bodies.

819
01:14:53.876 --> 01:14:57.630
""Grant that our brother,Juanito,
may sleep here in peace,

820
01:14:57.796 --> 01:15:02.074
""until you awaken him to glory,
then he will see you face to face,

821
01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:07.629
""and in your light we shall see light
and know the splendour of God,

822
01:15:07.796 --> 01:15:11.072
""for you live for ever and ever.
Amen.''

823
01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:20.714
<i>It's OK, jefito.
You can cry if you want.</i>

824
01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:35.227
The Aryan Vanguard's been insulted.

825
01:15:35.396 --> 01:15:38.866
You spics knew big Al
had insurance with the AV.

826
01:15:39.036 --> 01:15:45.111
So when your lamb strays from the flock,
I'm gonna kill the boy!

827
01:15:45.276 --> 01:15:47.426
I heard that.

828
01:15:49.076 --> 01:15:50.953
Al deserved to die.

829
01:15:51.116 --> 01:15:54.995
Besides, your AVers owed him
more money than most.

830
01:15:55.156 --> 01:15:56.987
So you made out fiine.

831
01:16:03.556 --> 01:16:05.148
He still dies.

832
01:16:05.316 --> 01:16:08.831
The council has authorised
a substantial cash offer

833
01:16:08.996 --> 01:16:12.147
to ensure nothing happens to Miklo.

834
01:16:12.316 --> 01:16:15.706
- I'm listening.
- Half of Al's cash.

835
01:16:15.876 --> 01:16:19.664
$8,000. We're now open for business.

836
01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:24.352
We'll give you 25% of every bet
from your members.

837
01:16:25.876 --> 01:16:28.390
You don't give me squat.

838
01:16:28.556 --> 01:16:33.949
You don't even do business
unless I say so. You understand?

839
01:16:34.116 --> 01:16:36.107
So?

840
01:16:37.356 --> 01:16:41.144
So? What are you giving
on the Lakers-76ers?

841
01:16:41.316 --> 01:16:47.266
<i>- Give the puto four on 76.
- 76ers and four points.</i>

842
01:16:52.156 --> 01:16:56.434
- Gimme the Lakers for a hundred.
- I'll take some of that.

843
01:17:02.556 --> 01:17:06.788
<i>Miklo, if Onda's going into business,
people must trust us.</i>

844
01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:09.675
<i>So treat everybody the same.</i>

845
01:17:09.836 --> 01:17:13.624
<i>The A Vers control the dope,
and the BGAers want to.</i>

846
01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.674
<i>Let 'em fight
while we build our bank account.</i>

847
01:17:16.836 --> 01:17:18.952
<i>We'll do business with both.</i>

848
01:17:19.116 --> 01:17:23.632
<i>Money knows no colour.
Everyone likes to gamble.</i>

849
01:17:23.796 --> 01:17:29.154
All right, old ladies. The milk man's
collecting the milk money.

850
01:17:29.716 --> 01:17:32.708
- I'll give you half a point more.
- All right.

851
01:17:32.876 --> 01:17:35.595
- That's the point spread.
- Cool.

852
01:17:35.756 --> 01:17:41.035
Here's some produce, freshly picked.
Right outta the fiield.

853
01:17:44.996 --> 01:17:46.588
Christmas time.

854
01:17:50.356 --> 01:17:55.066
<i>From now on I want 40% of everything
set aside for legal fees.</i>

855
01:17:55.236 --> 01:17:57.830
<i>We gotta start helping
our gente get out of here.</i>

856
01:17:57.996 --> 01:18:00.351
<i>Use 20% for presents
for the carnales.</i>

857
01:18:00.516 --> 01:18:04.304
Shame on you. Quit looking at boobs.
Look at a boob tube.

858
01:18:04.476 --> 01:18:06.194
<i>From El Mero Mero.</i>

859
01:18:06.356 --> 01:18:10.588
My BGA brothers.
Pockets, get rid of that natural look.

860
01:18:10.756 --> 01:18:13.634
Go back to processing to look like me.

861
01:18:13.796 --> 01:18:15.707
How about those Raiders?

862
01:18:15.876 --> 01:18:19.869
- BGA is always right.
- Got a special sale for tomorrow's fiight.

863
01:18:20.036 --> 01:18:25.394
Gonna be two for one.
Two for me, one for you!

864
01:18:25.556 --> 01:18:29.629
Don't talk to me about credit.
I got debts, too.

865
01:18:30.476 --> 01:18:33.468
<i>Now that Mosca and Flaco
are being transferred to Chino,</i>

866
01:18:33.636 --> 01:18:36.309
<i>we'll have a base near LA</i>

867
01:18:36.476 --> 01:18:40.708
<i>Give 'em money to set up
a legal fund and recruit soldiers.</i>

868
01:18:40.876 --> 01:18:42.548
<i>You got it, jefe.</i>

869
01:18:42.716 --> 01:18:45.435
Come on! This is my parole picture.

870
01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:51.068
You only get paroled once.
Magic, something to remember you by.

871
01:18:51.236 --> 01:18:54.945
<i>We got it now. Vato, take the picture.</i>

872
01:18:55.116 --> 01:18:58.188
Come on, I got people waiting.

873
01:18:59.196 --> 01:19:01.346
Ready?
Ándale.

874
01:19:11.196 --> 01:19:15.712
I grew up ten blocks from here,
but this place blows my mind.

875
01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:17.548
Looks like Hawaii.

876
01:19:18.716 --> 01:19:22.265
My father planted this forty years ago.

877
01:19:22.436 --> 01:19:25.906
Created the whole Yucatán, right here.

878
01:19:26.076 --> 01:19:31.104
- Carmen's the best chef in East Los.
- Right?

879
01:19:34.676 --> 01:19:37.110
Suck this liquorice stick.

880
01:19:39.196 --> 01:19:44.873
It's been dipped twenty times.
Makes you hump all night, Paco.

881
01:19:45.036 --> 01:19:49.393
With you two, I don't need
no marriage counsellor.

882
01:19:53.836 --> 01:19:55.952
I like your style, Paquito.

883
01:19:56.156 --> 01:20:02.470
Check it out. I know this shit is good.
The last batch you made was dynamite.

884
01:20:03.436 --> 01:20:07.873
But can you supply the quantity I need?

885
01:20:08.716 --> 01:20:11.867
First the money...

886
01:20:12.036 --> 01:20:15.028
...then the honey.

887
01:20:16.556 --> 01:20:19.593
Look, see my homie out there?

888
01:20:22.876 --> 01:20:25.390
You got nine more grand.

889
01:20:27.596 --> 01:20:30.064
Now show me yours.

890
01:20:35.316 --> 01:20:37.876
<i>Get him a caja.</i>

891
01:20:39.276 --> 01:20:43.508
- OK.
- Don't shake the baby food.

892
01:20:48.236 --> 01:20:52.514
PCP is very explosive.

893
01:20:54.356 --> 01:20:56.870
Boom!

894
01:20:57.036 --> 01:21:00.551
I'd hate to lose a handsome customer.

895
01:21:00.716 --> 01:21:04.231
Mommy, that feels good.

896
01:21:06.396 --> 01:21:08.546
Be careful with the chorizo.

897
01:21:08.716 --> 01:21:11.708
We might need it for later.

898
01:21:13.956 --> 01:21:18.234
Did you really make this stuff?
You a chemist?

899
01:21:18.396 --> 01:21:21.866
<i>I worked in a medical lab. Sí, mon?</i>

900
01:21:23.316 --> 01:21:28.310
Hey, baby, you ever had
a threesome?

901
01:21:28.476 --> 01:21:30.785
Let's take care of the deal fiirst.

902
01:21:30.956 --> 01:21:37.953
- What's the matter? Too much for you?
- I like business before pleasure.

903
01:21:38.116 --> 01:21:42.428
- He's a fucking cop!
- Rollie! Get in here!

904
01:21:46.236 --> 01:21:48.704
You son of a bitch!

905
01:21:51.236 --> 01:21:52.828
No!

906
01:21:59.836 --> 01:22:01.986
No!

907
01:22:05.196 --> 01:22:07.664
You killed my baby! Burn in hell!

908
01:22:07.836 --> 01:22:11.465
- It's PCP. Don't breathe!
- Get this shit off me!

909
01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:15.788
We'll get you to hospital.
No, no, we'll wash it off.

910
01:22:16.836 --> 01:22:19.475
<i>- Shit. It's a bust, ése.
- Goddamn it.</i>

911
01:22:19.636 --> 01:22:22.196
We lost the fucking lab
and Clavo's money.

912
01:22:22.356 --> 01:22:26.634
<i>The pinche loan shark's gonna shit!
How we gonna pay him back?</i>

913
01:22:26.796 --> 01:22:29.071
- We lost everything.
- There's Carmen.

914
01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:32.228
- Turn around.
- Who's that?

915
01:22:32.396 --> 01:22:36.184
- She's signalling something!
- Get back here! I gotta wash you off!

916
01:22:36.356 --> 01:22:38.586
Call in the perimeter!

917
01:22:39.196 --> 01:22:42.506
Police! Stop the car!

918
01:22:42.716 --> 01:22:46.709
Come out of the fucking car! Stop!

919
01:22:48.156 --> 01:22:50.272
Hands on the steering wheel!

920
01:22:50.436 --> 01:22:54.509
- Outta the car!
- Careful, we're taxpayers, Offiicer.

921
01:22:54.676 --> 01:22:56.951
You two, outta the car!

922
01:22:57.116 --> 01:22:59.994
<i>Órale, that's a nice placa, ése.</i>

923
01:23:00.156 --> 01:23:02.226
<i>Ride with me,
don't fuck with me, carnal.</i>

924
01:23:02.396 --> 01:23:04.956
<i>Don't call me carnal.
I'm not your brother.</i>

925
01:23:05.116 --> 01:23:07.505
Scumbags like you are killing our kids.

926
01:23:07.676 --> 01:23:10.395
Get dressed. That's indecent exposure.

927
01:23:10.556 --> 01:23:14.674
- What an example for the kids!
- Listen, you motherfucker.

928
01:23:14.836 --> 01:23:20.229
<i>I'll put you and your rat clica
back in the joint. Keep talking!</i>

929
01:23:20.396 --> 01:23:21.875
Put some clothes on!

930
01:23:22.036 --> 01:23:23.594
Got a warrant?

931
01:23:23.756 --> 01:23:27.590
You think you're bulletproof?
Check the trunk.

932
01:23:32.396 --> 01:23:37.106
- You think I never seen an OD?
- You don't recognise your own son?

933
01:23:37.276 --> 01:23:40.427
- That ain't Hector.
- No, Hector's only eleven.

934
01:23:40.596 --> 01:23:42.314
That boy's thirteen.

935
01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:47.755
If your boss keeps manufacturing shit,
it'll put Hector in the cemetery, too.

936
01:23:49.956 --> 01:23:55.314
<i>You may grow that hair and act like
a vato, but you smell like chorizo, pig.</i>

937
01:23:55.476 --> 01:24:00.072
This pig stands between you and them,
but you ain't getting through me.

938
01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:03.675
<i>I ain't no rata.</i>

939
01:24:03.836 --> 01:24:06.270
Yeah, you're a rat.

940
01:24:07.316 --> 01:24:11.753
Ladies and gentlemen,
my time here has turned me around.

941
01:24:11.916 --> 01:24:16.706
I'm very grateful. I can make it
as a productive member of society.

942
01:24:16.876 --> 01:24:21.347
Mr Velka,
didn't you clique with La Onda,

943
01:24:21.516 --> 01:24:26.636
whose motto is ""blood in, blood out'',
meaning you must kill to join?

944
01:24:26.796 --> 01:24:29.708
I hung out with some friends
from my neighbourhood.

945
01:24:29.876 --> 01:24:34.745
Our reputation grew from defending
each other, nothing more.

946
01:24:34.916 --> 01:24:36.634
<i>They didn't listen.</i>

947
01:24:38.316 --> 01:24:41.752
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Make something of your life.

948
01:24:41.916 --> 01:24:46.194
<i>I don't want you in here again,
me entiendes?</i>

949
01:24:47.556 --> 01:24:50.468
Look at my daughter. Look at her!

950
01:24:50.636 --> 01:24:53.309
She was only six months old
when I came here.

951
01:24:53.476 --> 01:24:58.266
She grew up without me.
I don't even know her.

952
01:24:59.676 --> 01:25:03.385
<i>- That ain't right, carnal.
- But it's that way for too many of us.</i>

953
01:25:03.556 --> 01:25:09.028
That's why your parole is so important.
You must prove there's another way.

954
01:25:10.596 --> 01:25:14.874
<i>- You got a chance to do it. I don't.
- Right on, carnal.</i>

955
01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:24.475
Thank you.

956
01:25:24.636 --> 01:25:27.992
<i>You gotta act
like you deserve parole.</i>

957
01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:32.229
<i>Put it on the record.
Earn your freedom on paper.</i>

958
01:25:32.396 --> 01:25:35.945
<i>All they see is yourjacket.
You are yourjacket.</i>

959
01:25:36.116 --> 01:25:38.869
<i>'Cause to them you'rejust a number.</i>

960
01:25:39.036 --> 01:25:43.507
<i>Everyone in thejoint thinks
he's a man, but he's a number.</i>

961
01:25:43.676 --> 01:25:45.712
<i>Worth thirty grand a year.</i>

962
01:25:45.876 --> 01:25:50.586
<i>They want us to come back.
What's worse, we're lining up to come.</i>

963
01:25:50.756 --> 01:25:54.908
<i>We gotta turn the system around
and outthink them.</i>

964
01:25:55.076 --> 01:25:59.467
<i>Concentrate.
"Why do you deserve parole?'"</i>

965
01:25:59.636 --> 01:26:02.434
I've been in prison a third of my life.

966
01:26:02.596 --> 01:26:07.590
I've grown up and learned to read
and write here. I earned my GED.

967
01:26:08.356 --> 01:26:14.591
Mr Velka, our concern is to fiind
evidence of your rehabilitation.

968
01:26:14.756 --> 01:26:17.429
With respect, look at my record.

969
01:26:17.596 --> 01:26:21.828
I worked to prove I deserve
another chance. It's in there clearly.

970
01:26:21.996 --> 01:26:24.794
Please give me another chance.

971
01:26:38.916 --> 01:26:45.435
- They're not that good, homes.
- That's the best I tasted in nine years.

972
01:26:47.556 --> 01:26:50.946
<i>- Good to be home, carnal.
- Right on.</i>

973
01:26:53.716 --> 01:26:56.310
That rose won't bloom in spring.

974
01:26:56.476 --> 01:26:59.786
No Baptist sermons, OK?

975
01:26:59.956 --> 01:27:03.312
It takes away my back pain.
The Lord can't.

976
01:27:03.476 --> 01:27:06.468
- I tried praying.
- You better still be painting.

977
01:27:06.636 --> 01:27:09.230
You know it, homes.

978
01:27:09.396 --> 01:27:12.468
But it's different than before.

979
01:27:12.636 --> 01:27:15.275
More real.

980
01:27:26.036 --> 01:27:30.746
""Famous Apartments'' ain't famous
no more.

981
01:27:30.916 --> 01:27:35.148
- Come stay in my studio.
- No, a friend got me a place.

982
01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:38.911
Besides, the parole board
checks my address.

983
01:27:39.076 --> 01:27:40.953
Thanks, Crucito.

984
01:27:41.116 --> 01:27:43.755
<i>Any time, carnal.</i>

985
01:27:46.396 --> 01:27:51.265
<i>- It's good to see you, vato.
- Vato Loco for ever, carnal.</i>

986
01:27:56.596 --> 01:27:58.826
<i>Nobody home.</i>

987
01:27:59.636 --> 01:28:01.831
<i>Go away!</i>

988
01:28:03.076 --> 01:28:05.226
What the fuck's with you?

989
01:28:07.036 --> 01:28:09.914
- Milkweed.
- I made it.

990
01:28:19.396 --> 01:28:23.514
<i>Welcome to the barrio, homes.</i>

991
01:28:23.676 --> 01:28:25.348
Hey! Smokey!

992
01:28:25.516 --> 01:28:28.428
Apache! Mudo!

993
01:28:28.596 --> 01:28:31.588
This is my homeboy from prison.

994
01:28:31.756 --> 01:28:34.065
<i>Hey, homes. Seen my hermano?</i>

995
01:28:34.236 --> 01:28:37.114
Yeah, Carlos told me to tell
your mom to send more coffee.

996
01:28:37.276 --> 01:28:41.667
- And make sure it's...TC.
- She never sent me none.

997
01:28:41.836 --> 01:28:44.828
<i>And put some clavo in it this time.</i>

998
01:28:45.756 --> 01:28:49.032
Chata! Some coffee!

999
01:28:49.196 --> 01:28:54.714
So, you got a place for me
in this building?

1000
01:28:56.916 --> 01:28:59.828
That didn't work out, homes.

1001
01:29:00.556 --> 01:29:02.945
The whole building's fiilled up.

1002
01:29:03.116 --> 01:29:06.950
What do I tell my parole offiicer?

1003
01:29:07.116 --> 01:29:09.550
Tell him to suck his pee-pee.

1004
01:29:12.116 --> 01:29:16.314
You can stay here.
It's the same address.

1005
01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:19.434
- I got you a job.
- Where's my apartment?

1006
01:29:19.596 --> 01:29:25.068
Just a minute, your majesty!
This ain't the joint, it's the streets.

1007
01:29:25.236 --> 01:29:28.626
You got no choice!
The parole board calls the shots here.

1008
01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:32.072
This is your address for three months!

1009
01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:41.231
La Onda can do better than this!

1010
01:29:41.396 --> 01:29:46.516
Rico and Luis split after a month.
I'm staying here for my wife and kids.

1011
01:29:46.676 --> 01:29:50.510
- What about Popeye?
- He takes a third of my cheque.

1012
01:29:50.676 --> 01:29:55.875
Everyone gets clipped
to pay that loan shark, Clavo.

1013
01:29:56.036 --> 01:29:59.108
It ain't supposed to be like this!

1014
01:30:08.196 --> 01:30:12.428
- Can I get my cheque?
- Larry, don't be that way.

1015
01:30:12.596 --> 01:30:15.429
Larry, pettiness is an ugly thing.

1016
01:30:15.596 --> 01:30:20.431
You can't cash that until Monday.
Company will do it for ten bucks.

1017
01:30:20.596 --> 01:30:22.348
All right.

1018
01:30:22.516 --> 01:30:25.747
What you give me
on the Lakers and Golden State?

1019
01:30:25.916 --> 01:30:29.989
Three points?
Come on, Kareem is crippled.

1020
01:30:30.956 --> 01:30:33.550
Gimme six points and Golden State.

1021
01:30:35.036 --> 01:30:39.234
- What?
- Barry's hurt. He's their offence.

1022
01:30:40.236 --> 01:30:41.589
Hang on, Larry.

1023
01:30:41.756 --> 01:30:45.385
So? Kareem is injured, so's Nixon.

1024
01:30:45.556 --> 01:30:48.548
Golden State's nothing without Barry.

1025
01:30:48.716 --> 01:30:51.025
Six points ain't enough.

1026
01:30:52.996 --> 01:30:55.954
Listen, six points or no bet.

1027
01:30:56.116 --> 01:30:57.834
Sorry, Larry.

1028
01:31:01.116 --> 01:31:02.993
All right.

1029
01:31:03.156 --> 01:31:05.750
Who made you the expert?

1030
01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:08.271
Put me down for 1 200.

1031
01:31:08.436 --> 01:31:11.553
Yeah. 1 200, Larry.

1032
01:31:14.076 --> 01:31:19.104
- East Los is really crowded.
- Illegals pouring in from everywhere.

1033
01:31:19.276 --> 01:31:24.430
<i>Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador,
Panamá... donde sea.</i>

1034
01:31:24.596 --> 01:31:29.386
<i>- Crossroads of the Latino world, ése.
- Sí, mon, ése.</i>

1035
01:31:29.556 --> 01:31:34.584
- You seen Paco?
- Not since Juanito died.

1036
01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:37.190
They don't want me around.

1037
01:31:37.356 --> 01:31:39.472
<i>That's cold-blooded, carnal.</i>

1038
01:31:39.636 --> 01:31:43.072
Paco's a narc, homes.
Probably bust me someday.

1039
01:31:43.236 --> 01:31:47.514
<i>- Man, that's fucked up!
- Es la vida.</i>

1040
01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:51.833
- Detective Aguilar.
- Detective! Big time.

1041
01:31:53.236 --> 01:31:55.796
- How is it, champ?
- Miklo?

1042
01:31:55.956 --> 01:31:58.390
<i>- Good guess.
- Are you out?</i>

1043
01:31:58.556 --> 01:32:01.514
<i>- Two weeks.
- Why didn't you let me know?</i>

1044
01:32:01.676 --> 01:32:06.704
After nine years in the joint,
it ain't easy to call a cop.

1045
01:32:06.876 --> 01:32:11.904
<i>I'm not calling about me.
It's Cruz. He needs his familia.</i>

1046
01:32:13.156 --> 01:32:15.306
He has no family.

1047
01:32:15.476 --> 01:32:18.673
<i>That ain't right, Paco!
Vatos Locos for ever, remember?</i>

1048
01:32:18.836 --> 01:32:22.829
I remember when they lowered
my little brother into the ground.

1049
01:32:22.996 --> 01:32:25.669
That changed me for ever.

1050
01:32:25.836 --> 01:32:30.273
I see a junkie, I think how Crucito
pissed away his life and talent.

1051
01:32:30.436 --> 01:32:37.228
<i>- Think about it. I gotta get to work.
- Carnal, how are you doing?</i>

1052
01:32:37.396 --> 01:32:39.990
- There anything I can do to help?
- No.

1053
01:32:40.156 --> 01:32:45.184
<i>I wanna make it outta here
on my own. I really want to, carnal.</i>

1054
01:32:45.356 --> 01:32:50.271
Lots of chances to go the other way,
but I'm gonna make it, Paco.

1055
01:32:50.436 --> 01:32:55.749
<i>- That's great, carnal. That's great.
- Nos vemos.</i>

1056
01:33:04.956 --> 01:33:07.390
I need the keys to the trucks.

1057
01:33:07.556 --> 01:33:10.866
Make sure the tyres are out
and they're washed.

1058
01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:17.914
So you know your hoops.

1059
01:33:19.876 --> 01:33:26.224
Hey, turn the noise down upstairs.

1060
01:33:26.396 --> 01:33:29.308
What the fuck?

1061
01:33:33.876 --> 01:33:36.265
""Fuck The World.''

1062
01:33:42.796 --> 01:33:45.913
Please get outta my bed. I gotta sleep.

1063
01:33:46.076 --> 01:33:47.589
<i>Later, ése.</i>

1064
01:33:47.756 --> 01:33:51.271
Get the fuck outta my bed!
I gotta work tomorrow!

1065
01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:56.192
- What's up with you?
- That's my space!

1066
01:34:08.316 --> 01:34:12.195
Gil, there's a mistake on my cheque.
I'm 1 50 dollars short.

1067
01:34:12.356 --> 01:34:15.746
- I worked overtime last week.
- That's right.

1068
01:34:15.916 --> 01:34:20.785
I'm going to do it seven more times
till you pay back the money you stole.

1069
01:34:20.956 --> 01:34:24.665
What? I've been totally straight with you.

1070
01:34:26.636 --> 01:34:32.188
I try to give you cons a break,
but you see money and you steal it.

1071
01:34:32.356 --> 01:34:35.553
That's a lie!
It wasn't me that stole from you!

1072
01:34:35.716 --> 01:34:38.594
You had the keys.
You knew where the money was.

1073
01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:40.587
What?

1074
01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:44.634
I didn't do anything.

1075
01:34:44.796 --> 01:34:46.593
Wait a minute...

1076
01:34:48.476 --> 01:34:52.264
1 50 times 8 is 1 200. Right?

1077
01:34:53.556 --> 01:34:55.433
Right?

1078
01:34:55.596 --> 01:35:00.272
You used my money to pay back
your gambling debts!

1079
01:35:00.436 --> 01:35:04.190
That's a cute story.
I'm gonna call the cops.

1080
01:35:04.356 --> 01:35:08.952
I tell 'em my version.
You tell 'em yours...convict.

1081
01:35:21.316 --> 01:35:26.629
Hey, I'll get you some extra overtime.

1082
01:35:28.476 --> 01:35:31.070
Yeah, right...

1083
01:35:31.236 --> 01:35:34.353
So much for going straight.
He has me by the balls.

1084
01:35:34.516 --> 01:35:38.191
He can get my parole revoked any time.

1085
01:35:38.356 --> 01:35:41.985
It's just to get you on your feet.
You'll get something better.

1086
01:35:42.156 --> 01:35:46.149
Maybe I can be a priest and
get some tax-free Sunday money!

1087
01:35:46.316 --> 01:35:51.788
I was doing better than this in the joint.
It ain't worth it. There's no respect.

1088
01:35:51.956 --> 01:35:54.675
<i>- Oye! Open up!
- Quién es?</i>

1089
01:35:54.836 --> 01:35:56.827
Ronald Reagan, asshole.

1090
01:35:59.116 --> 01:36:04.509
<i>- Who the fuck are you, pendejo?
- I live here! My house!</i>

1091
01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:09.067
- What you say, fucker?
- Easy with the gun!

1092
01:36:09.236 --> 01:36:11.909
Popeye, who's the white boy?

1093
01:36:12.076 --> 01:36:16.513
Hey, it's cool. He's crashing here.

1094
01:36:20.156 --> 01:36:23.865
Popeye, I said no artillery here.
Get these people out.

1095
01:36:24.036 --> 01:36:27.267
Go change a tyre.
We're talking business.

1096
01:36:27.436 --> 01:36:30.269
You ain't making deals
and fucking up my parole!

1097
01:36:30.436 --> 01:36:34.190
<i>- Come on, ése.
- No, this is my house!</i>

1098
01:36:34.356 --> 01:36:38.031
Crucito? Hey, Cruz.

1099
01:36:38.796 --> 01:36:42.425
<i>- Where you been, ése?
- Hey, Clavo. Qué pasó?</i>

1100
01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:49.468
You're a tough momma to fiind.
Where are the four Gs you owe me?

1101
01:36:49.636 --> 01:36:55.154
<i>Look, homes. I gotta sell a couple
of paintings. I'll get your feria.</i>

1102
01:36:55.316 --> 01:36:58.991
Paintings, that's right.
At least you gave me some paintings.

1103
01:36:59.156 --> 01:37:03.195
<i>This baboso hasn't given me dick.
Can you believe that?</i>

1104
01:37:03.356 --> 01:37:07.872
What about the 30% you get from
our cheques at the retread shop?

1105
01:37:08.036 --> 01:37:11.028
That's not what Onda's about.
I ain't paying you shit!

1106
01:37:11.196 --> 01:37:16.111
- Shut up. I represent Onda here.
- You represent yourself. You always did.

1107
01:37:16.276 --> 01:37:20.155
Hey, Papa, you been collecting?
What about our share?

1108
01:37:20.316 --> 01:37:23.513
Me, too? You said you were broke!

1109
01:37:23.676 --> 01:37:26.668
I don't come here to hear you whining.

1110
01:37:26.836 --> 01:37:31.512
I'm talking about a hundred grand.
In Nueva York, that wakes people up.

1111
01:37:31.676 --> 01:37:36.067
- Anybody got a problem with that?
- No.

1112
01:37:36.236 --> 01:37:38.704
Then, what's the bullshit?

1113
01:37:38.876 --> 01:37:41.310
We're gonna do it.

1114
01:37:41.476 --> 01:37:46.231
I got Mudo out on the street
copping some wheels and...

1115
01:37:46.396 --> 01:37:50.230
...we got the muscle,
you just give us the plan.

1116
01:37:50.396 --> 01:37:54.833
You got the muscle to jack yourself off.
That's it.

1117
01:37:55.156 --> 01:37:59.229
Watch your back
or I'll put you in high heels again!

1118
01:37:59.396 --> 01:38:04.754
Make your move, motherfucker!
I'll send you to hell with Big Al!

1119
01:38:11.556 --> 01:38:16.835
I ain't got time to waste
on your wolf tickets, chump.

1120
01:38:16.996 --> 01:38:19.556
You're right, kid.

1121
01:38:19.716 --> 01:38:23.026
This chump can't even
change his socks.

1122
01:38:23.196 --> 01:38:26.108
He can't...but I can.

1123
01:38:26.276 --> 01:38:30.667
- Hey, Clavo, wait...
- What's the scam?

1124
01:38:30.836 --> 01:38:35.068
I need a trigger-man, white boy,
not someone who punches a clock.

1125
01:38:35.236 --> 01:38:37.511
Wanna see who I am?

1126
01:38:38.596 --> 01:38:41.827
- I don't give warning shots.
- The money truck or help each other?

1127
01:38:41.996 --> 01:38:44.669
We're few, but we're crazy!

1128
01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:49.591
- Miklo, don't fuck around.
- Realthing...

1129
01:38:51.716 --> 01:38:53.866
<i>- Miklo, this vato's big trouble.
- Cállate!</i>

1130
01:38:54.036 --> 01:38:57.392
You bluff in this game,
you better have fiive aces.

1131
01:38:57.556 --> 01:39:01.549
In the joint I hustled more money
than he dreamed of.

1132
01:39:01.716 --> 01:39:03.593
What's the gig?

1133
01:39:03.756 --> 01:39:07.874
Armoured truck at the Zody's,
Saturday night. Lotta cash.

1134
01:39:08.036 --> 01:39:11.472
Popeye cleans his debt and gets 1 0%.

1135
01:39:11.636 --> 01:39:16.187
<i>Chale. Armoured truck's a dumb deal.
Too dangerous.</i>

1136
01:39:16.356 --> 01:39:21.066
Not this one, smart boy.
The driver's a customer.

1137
01:39:21.236 --> 01:39:23.989
Don't interfere, white boy.

1138
01:39:26.236 --> 01:39:28.750
OK. We'll do it.

1139
01:39:29.436 --> 01:39:33.634
But it's 50-50.
And you wipe out Cruz's debt.

1140
01:39:33.796 --> 01:39:36.913
Don't get fucked up in this bullshit.
Stay straight!

1141
01:39:37.076 --> 01:39:41.991
No sermons, remember?
This is who I am.

1142
01:39:44.436 --> 01:39:50.386
So, do we gift-wrap this sucker for you,
or do you walk away empty-handed?

1143
01:39:50.556 --> 01:39:52.069
60-40.

1144
01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:54.466
Realthing handles the cash.

1145
01:39:54.636 --> 01:39:58.470
You get the guns and a car.
Apache's driving.

1146
01:39:58.636 --> 01:40:01.833
Me and Smokes'll back up Realthing.

1147
01:40:01.996 --> 01:40:05.989
- OK, I can deal with that.
- You're gonna have to.

1148
01:40:06.156 --> 01:40:11.628
- Hey, what about me, fucker?
- You're out of it, asshole.

1149
01:40:12.716 --> 01:40:15.230
It's payback time, Popeye.

1150
01:40:15.396 --> 01:40:18.672
I'm gonna take back my rent money.
With interest!

1151
01:40:21.516 --> 01:40:24.633
<i>Órale. Let's have a drink, ése.</i>

1152
01:40:30.516 --> 01:40:33.986
Detective Aguilar?
Delivery from El Tepeyac.

1153
01:40:34.156 --> 01:40:37.432
- I got you, man.
- No way.

1154
01:40:37.596 --> 01:40:40.349
- I knew it was you.
- Check out Manuel's special.

1155
01:40:40.516 --> 01:40:44.225
Is this a nuclear accident burrito?
Something for us till lunch.

1156
01:40:44.396 --> 01:40:46.990
""Us''? You mean the two of you.

1157
01:40:47.156 --> 01:40:50.193
I'm an undercover cop.
I'm working on my character look.

1158
01:40:50.356 --> 01:40:53.587
- A fat undercover cop.
- Does this look real or fake?

1159
01:40:53.756 --> 01:40:57.305
<i>- Real. Right? McCann.
- Oye, narco.</i>

1160
01:40:57.476 --> 01:41:02.186
<i>- You like busting dope dealers?
- Oye, pendejo. It's my lunch hour.</i>

1161
01:41:02.356 --> 01:41:07.476
- Big deal tomorrow. Zody's on Whittier.
- Who is this?

1162
01:41:07.636 --> 01:41:11.754
Look for a blue Econoline van
with 20 keys of coke inside.

1163
01:41:11.916 --> 01:41:16.228
- You'll be on the 6 o'clock news.
- Oh, yeah? Who is this?

1164
01:41:18.356 --> 01:41:22.713
If shit goes down, we're gonna be
two sorry assholes without back-up.

1165
01:41:22.876 --> 01:41:27.028
How many times we done this and
nothing's happened? A lot. Relax.

1166
01:41:27.196 --> 01:41:28.993
Have a doughnut.

1167
01:41:29.156 --> 01:41:32.432
- I already have one.
- Have another. Look at these.

1168
01:41:32.596 --> 01:41:34.473
What a dick.

1169
01:41:34.636 --> 01:41:38.311
Dick and asshole. That's all you call me.
What's my name? Dick Asshole?

1170
01:41:38.476 --> 01:41:41.195
Hey, blue Econoline van.
That your guy?

1171
01:41:41.356 --> 01:41:43.506
I don't know.

1172
01:41:47.436 --> 01:41:50.826
- Do you see a connection?
- No.

1173
01:41:50.996 --> 01:41:54.989
Two Latino males in front,
more in the back. Don't know how many.

1174
01:41:55.156 --> 01:41:59.354
- That's a lot for a dope deal.
- Wait a minute.

1175
01:41:59.516 --> 01:42:02.189
Shit! They're gonna take
the money and the dope.

1176
01:42:02.356 --> 01:42:06.235
No, there's an armoured truck.
Shit, this is a heist! Call it in!

1177
01:42:06.396 --> 01:42:09.513
2-1 1 in progress, Zody's on Whittier!

1178
01:42:10.516 --> 01:42:12.268
Look out!

1179
01:42:15.316 --> 01:42:16.715
C'mon!

1180
01:42:27.956 --> 01:42:30.550
I got you covered! Let's go!

1181
01:42:36.476 --> 01:42:38.592
Shit! Apache, cover me!

1182
01:42:40.436 --> 01:42:44.065
- What they doing here?
- Apache, wait!

1183
01:42:44.396 --> 01:42:46.114
Shit.

1184
01:42:49.636 --> 01:42:53.709
- Two of them heading south.
- Call it in!

1185
01:43:31.516 --> 01:43:33.632
<i>- It's me, carnal!
- Miklo?</i>

1186
01:43:33.796 --> 01:43:36.435
What the fuck are you doing?

1187
01:43:36.596 --> 01:43:39.269
<i>- Gimme the gun, carnal.
- No way!</i>

1188
01:43:39.436 --> 01:43:42.587
- I can help you.
- I ain't going back, Paco!

1189
01:43:42.756 --> 01:43:46.146
<i>You owe me this one, Vato Loco!</i>

1190
01:43:46.316 --> 01:43:48.910
No! Miklo, wait! I can't!

1191
01:43:49.076 --> 01:43:51.306
- Stop! Police!
- Fuck you, detective!

1192
01:43:51.476 --> 01:43:53.546
Stop or I'll shoot!

1193
01:45:36.036 --> 01:45:40.427
Cruz, when you gonna fiinish
messing with that shit?

1194
01:45:40.596 --> 01:45:43.668
You painted it about twenty times.

1195
01:45:45.516 --> 01:45:51.113
- C'mon, let's ride the horse.
- We got an intruder.

1196
01:45:51.276 --> 01:45:56.873
Oh, shit, homes, it's John Wayne.

1197
01:45:58.556 --> 01:46:05.507
<i>""You're just a bunch of chavalas
and I can whip all you Chicanos.''</i>

1198
01:46:05.676 --> 01:46:08.474
So what you want?

1199
01:46:09.836 --> 01:46:12.475
<i>Not much, carnalito.</i>

1200
01:46:12.636 --> 01:46:18.347
""Hey. How are you?'' Things people
usually say who care about each other.

1201
01:46:19.676 --> 01:46:23.954
After seven years of nothing,
not even a fucking card,

1202
01:46:24.116 --> 01:46:26.630
you want hospitality?

1203
01:46:26.796 --> 01:46:31.916
<i>There's a can of chinga a tu madre
right there. Help yourself.</i>

1204
01:46:32.076 --> 01:46:36.354
Did you say, ""Hey, homes!'' to Miklo
before you shot him?

1205
01:46:36.516 --> 01:46:40.111
He was a shooter in a robbery.
I was doing my job.

1206
01:46:40.276 --> 01:46:45.509
<i>- You can't kill innocent people.
- You're a pinche traitor, puto!</i>

1207
01:46:45.676 --> 01:46:51.148
<i>- Fuck you!
- Hey, cálmala! Fucking relax!</i>

1208
01:46:51.316 --> 01:46:53.625
Hey, leave him alone!

1209
01:46:53.796 --> 01:46:56.390
Fuck you, wimp!

1210
01:46:56.556 --> 01:46:59.309
Don't come here
unless you're gonna bust me.

1211
01:46:59.476 --> 01:47:01.990
Who said you could use
my little brother in your painting?

1212
01:47:02.156 --> 01:47:04.545
<i>He's my carnalito, too!</i>

1213
01:47:04.716 --> 01:47:10.234
Don't use him as an excuse to wreck
your life. You don't have that right.

1214
01:47:13.876 --> 01:47:20.714
I don't have the right, huh?
Fucking right I don't.

1215
01:47:20.876 --> 01:47:26.508
I don't have that fucking right.
You want him out my painting?

1216
01:47:26.676 --> 01:47:31.625
<i>There he is! Ahí está, toma!
Take it, man! Come on!</i>

1217
01:47:31.796 --> 01:47:35.789
<i>Juanito always loved me more than you.
Tú te creías muy chingón.</i>

1218
01:47:35.956 --> 01:47:41.189
You were too much of a badass
to love him.Just like you are now.

1219
01:47:41.356 --> 01:47:45.144
- You kill your own people!
- No!

1220
01:47:45.316 --> 01:47:47.989
Don't ever say that again. I let you once.

1221
01:47:48.156 --> 01:47:51.387
<i>Qué, puto? You gonna kick my ass?</i>

1222
01:47:51.556 --> 01:47:56.027
Let's get down!
C'mon, you're the badass!

1223
01:47:56.196 --> 01:47:58.949
- I don't wanna fiight.
- Do what? Bust me?

1224
01:47:59.116 --> 01:48:01.994
<i>Well, gabacho, do your job!</i>

1225
01:48:03.556 --> 01:48:05.672
Do your fucking job!

1226
01:48:34.036 --> 01:48:36.470
Look at this.

1227
01:48:36.636 --> 01:48:38.627
Look at that.

1228
01:48:40.076 --> 01:48:43.512
Must be from Quentin, huh?

1229
01:48:43.676 --> 01:48:47.464
- Hey, he's the guy...
- PCP bust. That's Popeye Savedra.

1230
01:48:47.636 --> 01:48:49.831
Miklo's connected to him.

1231
01:48:49.996 --> 01:48:53.386
<i>"La Onda. A toda madre,
o un desmadre. '"</i>

1232
01:48:53.556 --> 01:48:55.751
- What's Onda?
- No, La Onda.

1233
01:48:55.916 --> 01:48:59.431
It's your destiny.
Like a wave nothing can stop.

1234
01:48:59.596 --> 01:49:03.111
<i>- Madre means mother, so...
- It's more complicated.</i>

1235
01:49:03.276 --> 01:49:08.430
<i>This is heavy shit. A toda madre.
everything is perfect.</i>

1236
01:49:08.596 --> 01:49:11.030
It's like your mother's love.

1237
01:49:11.196 --> 01:49:15.712
<i>Un desmadre.
it's like you have no mother.</i>

1238
01:49:15.876 --> 01:49:17.992
Absolute hatred.
Complete destruction.

1239
01:49:18.156 --> 01:49:21.068
In other words, you win it all
or lose everything.

1240
01:49:21.236 --> 01:49:23.147
Sweet bunch of guys.

1241
01:49:23.316 --> 01:49:27.832
This fat pig, Popeye.
He's gotta be their leader.

1242
01:49:27.996 --> 01:49:29.952
Look at the way
they're grouped around him.

1243
01:49:30.116 --> 01:49:34.507
Hey, Aguilar.
That con you blasted is out of surgery.

1244
01:49:35.236 --> 01:49:39.309
He's gonna be easier to catch now.

1245
01:49:51.836 --> 01:49:54.987
Nurse, could you give me
a minute, please?

1246
01:50:01.756 --> 01:50:04.668
<i>Por la Virgen, I did not know that...</i>

1247
01:50:04.836 --> 01:50:09.512
<i>Don't talk about La Virgen
or Vatos Locos for ever.</i>

1248
01:50:09.676 --> 01:50:13.271
That all died
when you pulled the trigger.

1249
01:50:19.796 --> 01:50:22.788
How did it all get so fucked up, man?

1250
01:50:22.956 --> 01:50:26.710
<i>That pinche badge, ése.</i>

1251
01:50:26.876 --> 01:50:30.312
<i>You owed me, vendido.</i>

1252
01:50:30.476 --> 01:50:32.626
Who's the sell-out?

1253
01:50:32.796 --> 01:50:36.948
You tell me you're going straight,
then you point a .357 at me

1254
01:50:37.116 --> 01:50:39.550
and two guys are dead on the ground.

1255
01:50:39.716 --> 01:50:46.235
I'd have given you anything.
But you can't take away what I am.

1256
01:50:47.796 --> 01:50:53.553
You chose the wrong side.
There's too many of us. You'll lose.

1257
01:50:53.716 --> 01:50:56.628
No, I don't forget
where I'm from or who I am.

1258
01:50:56.796 --> 01:51:00.505
That's what keeps me going every day.

1259
01:51:00.676 --> 01:51:04.271
- You don't want to hear the truth.
- What truth?

1260
01:51:04.436 --> 01:51:07.189
This? Is La Onda your truth?

1261
01:51:07.356 --> 01:51:09.950
Punks like Popeye with their PCP,

1262
01:51:10.116 --> 01:51:14.234
or you robbing Zody's and
killing innocent people?

1263
01:51:14.396 --> 01:51:20.631
- That's your truth, I don't wanna hear it.
- Get out! You're not my blood!

1264
01:51:20.796 --> 01:51:25.074
I'm cutting you off like they did my leg.

1265
01:51:25.236 --> 01:51:28.546
You don't exist for me any more.

1266
01:51:42.636 --> 01:51:48.313
Miklo! What's up?
Looking good, homie!

1267
01:52:02.036 --> 01:52:07.156
Hopalong, tell Carlos to stop fucking
with my business or he's dead.

1268
01:52:07.316 --> 01:52:10.831
- Not in public.
- No junkie gonna rip off my customers.

1269
01:52:10.996 --> 01:52:13.112
Velka. Time to lock up.

1270
01:52:13.276 --> 01:52:16.188
<i>Mira, mira. It's the bionic man.</i>

1271
01:52:16.356 --> 01:52:20.827
- Carlos, what's with the BGA?
- Cheap conversation. Sore losers.

1272
01:52:20.996 --> 01:52:25.308
-Just flapping their crow wings.
- Pockets is on the warpath.

1273
01:52:25.476 --> 01:52:29.549
The customers know quality.
He's been selling them baby powder.

1274
01:52:29.716 --> 01:52:32.469
I don't have all day. Get in.

1275
01:52:32.636 --> 01:52:36.595
-Hey, Mágico. We're gonna be cellies.
-Órale

1276
01:52:36.756 --> 01:52:39.145
Move here, let me get the cuffs.

1277
01:52:39.356 --> 01:52:42.268
<i>Órale, that's a badass pano.</i>

1278
01:52:42.436 --> 01:52:46.031
You been burning quills.
You're getting good.

1279
01:52:46.196 --> 01:52:48.710
It's yours.

1280
01:52:50.196 --> 01:52:53.393
My ""home sweet home'' picture.

1281
01:52:53.556 --> 01:52:55.672
At least this bum leg got me something.

1282
01:52:55.836 --> 01:52:58.066
I get to work at the law library.

1283
01:52:58.236 --> 01:53:01.672
What's that mad-dogging
between Carlos and the BGA?

1284
01:53:01.836 --> 01:53:05.431
<i>The vato's got one
sweet cocaine connection.</i>

1285
01:53:05.596 --> 01:53:09.828
- He's moving in on Pockets' customers.
- How did he connect?

1286
01:53:09.996 --> 01:53:13.784
Nobody knows. But it's dynamite shit.
Pure Bolivian flake.

1287
01:53:13.956 --> 01:53:17.028
Montana just watched Carlos jump in?

1288
01:53:17.196 --> 01:53:21.155
<i>Plata talks.
Carlos is recruiting lots of soldiers.</i>

1289
01:53:21.316 --> 01:53:24.388
And buying influence on the council
to neutralise Montana.

1290
01:53:24.556 --> 01:53:28.105
- Says it's his own trip, not Onda's!
- That's bullshit!

1291
01:53:28.276 --> 01:53:31.029
Personal trips are fucking Onda up.

1292
01:53:31.196 --> 01:53:35.986
I saw out on the streets
that we're cutting our own throats.

1293
01:53:37.476 --> 01:53:42.504
<i>Damn, your leg, carnal.
It's too soon to be walking on it.</i>

1294
01:53:42.676 --> 01:53:48.228
Long way up. But they're not gonna
put me on the fiirst tier without...

1295
01:53:48.396 --> 01:53:50.114
<i>...my carnales.</i>

1296
01:53:53.396 --> 01:53:56.786
Your cousin did that?
That's disgusting!

1297
01:53:56.956 --> 01:54:00.426
<i>- You should put a hit on that puto.
- No, he's mine.</i>

1298
01:54:00.596 --> 01:54:02.791
His payback's gonna take time.

1299
01:54:02.956 --> 01:54:04.753
I'm gonna make him sorry...

1300
01:54:04.916 --> 01:54:06.907
he fucked with me.

1301
01:54:07.076 --> 01:54:10.546
<i>- Hey, puto.
- What the fuck you doing, chorizo?</i>

1302
01:54:10.716 --> 01:54:13.230
Trying to jump-start your memory.
Turn around.

1303
01:54:13.396 --> 01:54:16.627
- Where the fuck is Popeye Savedra?
- He took off.

1304
01:54:16.796 --> 01:54:21.631
Right after Zody's, right?
You were in on that, too.

1305
01:54:21.796 --> 01:54:24.993
<i>- You know these putos?
- No. No way.</i>

1306
01:54:25.156 --> 01:54:29.388
And La Onda. Isn't that what
the snake tattoo means?

1307
01:54:29.556 --> 01:54:33.231
- Isn't that what it means?
- I dunno what you're talking about.

1308
01:54:33.396 --> 01:54:37.435
I'll tell you.
You're a two-time loser, Smokey.

1309
01:54:37.596 --> 01:54:38.995
Another and you'll be locked up for good.

1310
01:54:39.156 --> 01:54:43.434
Tell me about Onda or
you'll never see the streets again.

1311
01:54:43.596 --> 01:54:48.112
If I talk, I'm dead meat.
I ain't telling you shit!

1312
01:54:57.996 --> 01:55:00.556
<i>It's baby powder, baboso.</i>

1313
01:55:02.346 --> 01:55:05.975
Write down every word I say.
Ask if you don't understand.

1314
01:55:06.146 --> 01:55:08.979
I'll answer just once, so write it down.

1315
01:55:09.146 --> 01:55:13.059
<i>Habeas corpus precedents,
cruel and unusual punishment here.</i>

1316
01:55:13.226 --> 01:55:16.821
- You can also help on Duran Decree.
- How much can you charge?

1317
01:55:16.986 --> 01:55:19.739
You must know what you're doing fiirst.

1318
01:55:19.906 --> 01:55:25.378
Ajailhouse lawyer earns as much
as a mid-level attorney on the street.

1319
01:55:25.546 --> 01:55:27.741
I'm gonna live in here.

1320
01:55:28.986 --> 01:55:33.582
-Jerry, I don't mean to be nosy, but...
- Then don't be.

1321
01:55:34.546 --> 01:55:37.185
All right, what is it?

1322
01:55:37.346 --> 01:55:39.985
I just wondered...

1323
01:55:40.146 --> 01:55:45.823
...you own all those hardware stores,
how come you're in here?

1324
01:55:45.986 --> 01:55:49.023
Eleven tons of Colombian weed,
twelve keys of heroin

1325
01:55:49.186 --> 01:55:52.576
and a pilot that turned state's evidence.

1326
01:55:52.786 --> 01:55:55.346
<i>Chingao. Big time.</i>

1327
01:55:55.506 --> 01:55:59.021
- I just want you to handle my case.
- Hurry up,Jerry.

1328
01:55:59.186 --> 01:56:03.225
<i>- Got an appointment?
- I'm paying you a lot of feria.</i>

1329
01:56:03.386 --> 01:56:06.583
- Make an appointment.
- You should work overtime on my case.

1330
01:56:06.746 --> 01:56:09.214
Cool out or get out. George, table.

1331
01:56:11.466 --> 01:56:16.779
Miklo. Take off your leg
and hook down some high books.

1332
01:56:18.266 --> 01:56:21.781
Hey, I'm just kidding. Come here.

1333
01:56:21.946 --> 01:56:26.303
Relax. I got medicine to make you well.

1334
01:56:26.466 --> 01:56:29.822
If you're in pain, come and talk to me.

1335
01:56:29.986 --> 01:56:33.661
<i>You should talk to El Mero Mero.</i>

1336
01:56:33.826 --> 01:56:37.136
Think about the future, not the past.
Montana's not God.

1337
01:56:37.306 --> 01:56:40.981
<i>Tomorrow I'll give Onda the chance
to move into the driver's seat.</i>

1338
01:56:41.146 --> 01:56:42.898
<i>Don't be left behind.</i>

1339
01:56:44.386 --> 01:56:46.616
I cut a sweet deal with the AVers.

1340
01:56:46.786 --> 01:56:49.584
They'll supply me with all the dope,

1341
01:56:49.746 --> 01:56:53.705
as long as I sell
only to blacks and browns.

1342
01:56:53.866 --> 01:56:57.779
What do you have to give in return
to the Polar Bears?

1343
01:56:59.506 --> 01:57:06.218
I gotta plug up the BGA pipeline.
Take 'em outta the dope business.

1344
01:57:06.386 --> 01:57:09.822
<i>It's simple. Me and my soldados
take care of Pockets.</i>

1345
01:57:09.986 --> 01:57:14.138
My brother Smokey takes out
Cheap Times, their supply joint in LA

1346
01:57:14.306 --> 01:57:17.104
All I need from the council is back-up.

1347
01:57:17.266 --> 01:57:21.100
In return I'll give Onda
a third of my profiits.

1348
01:57:21.266 --> 01:57:23.905
<i>It's a sucker's deal. Como siempre.</i>

1349
01:57:24.066 --> 01:57:27.820
The Aryans want a war
between black and brown.

1350
01:57:27.986 --> 01:57:33.219
<i>- We got a truce with the BGA.
- Why play the sheep with mayates?</i>

1351
01:57:33.386 --> 01:57:38.824
The market is there.
Cocaine is America's cup of coffee.

1352
01:57:42.066 --> 01:57:48.585
<i>I make so much feria,
Miklo's gambling looks like change.</i>

1353
01:57:48.746 --> 01:57:51.658
We don't start wars
to become dope pushers.

1354
01:57:51.826 --> 01:57:54.260
<i>You even addicted
some of our soldados to coca.</i>

1355
01:57:54.426 --> 01:57:58.783
We should protect our people,
not destroy them.

1356
01:57:58.946 --> 01:58:02.734
Look at his arms. He loves that shit
more than he loves us.

1357
01:58:02.906 --> 01:58:05.704
- He'll destroy La Onda.
- Enough words.

1358
01:58:05.866 --> 01:58:09.700
<i>We've come so far. You want to go back
to bumming cigarettes, ése?</i>

1359
01:58:09.866 --> 01:58:13.097
- You wanna shine shoes?
- La Onda don't shine shoes.

1360
01:58:13.266 --> 01:58:18.386
We will if we don't move now!
I wanna own the whole store.

1361
01:58:18.546 --> 01:58:22.937
<i>- Are you with me?
- I say chale. You're not the leader.</i>

1362
01:58:23.106 --> 01:58:28.100
I say Onda's not with you.
Do it without us.

1363
01:58:31.626 --> 01:58:33.025
I can't.

1364
01:58:33.826 --> 01:58:35.942
Forget you all...

1365
01:58:36.106 --> 01:58:38.939
...'cause I ain't going back.

1366
01:58:40.466 --> 01:58:46.018
I don't need Onda for this.
Money buys my back-up.

1367
01:58:46.186 --> 01:58:50.543
I'll get the Polar Bears
to back my play.

1368
01:59:00.346 --> 01:59:02.064
Carlos! Come back!

1369
01:59:02.226 --> 01:59:06.299
<i>Jefe, we can't let him go.
Can't let him split up Onda. Carlos!</i>

1370
01:59:06.466 --> 01:59:10.618
<i>Montana's stupid to let Charlie walk.
Onda's committing suicide.</i>

1371
01:59:10.786 --> 01:59:15.462
- Fuck you!
- Didn't you want to learn something?

1372
01:59:16.746 --> 01:59:19.977
Charlie broke some
serious business rules.

1373
01:59:20.146 --> 01:59:22.216
He got strung out on his own shit

1374
01:59:22.386 --> 01:59:27.221
and moved on BGA clients
when he didn't have to.

1375
01:59:27.386 --> 01:59:32.904
80% of the cons that come in here
are drug cases.

1376
01:59:33.066 --> 01:59:35.375
Why? Because everyone's doing it.

1377
01:59:35.546 --> 01:59:39.937
Doctors, lawyers, housewives.
Cocaine is America's cup of coffee.

1378
01:59:44.426 --> 01:59:47.338
You were Carlos's connection.

1379
01:59:47.506 --> 01:59:50.862
He said the same ""coffee'' line.
You supplied him.

1380
01:59:51.026 --> 01:59:53.904
You're pissed 'cause he's doing
business with the AVers.

1381
01:59:54.066 --> 01:59:57.820
California just passed the flat time law.
Know what that means?

1382
01:59:57.986 --> 02:00:01.615
Drug offenders have it worse
than murderers, rapists, anyone.

1383
02:00:01.786 --> 02:00:08.055
No parole, no good time.
A lotta drug users here for a long time.

1384
02:00:08.226 --> 02:00:11.696
- Can you see the potential?
- Yeah.

1385
02:00:11.866 --> 02:00:17.145
If you accommodate that appetite,
you control this and every other joint.

1386
02:00:17.306 --> 02:00:19.536
Dwell on it.

1387
02:00:29.586 --> 02:00:34.614
Your appeal briefs.Jerry said it'll take
three months for the court to respond.

1388
02:00:34.786 --> 02:00:39.416
Well, well, well, Lightning.
Our favourite spic lover's come home.

1389
02:00:39.586 --> 02:00:42.225
- I knew he'd be back.
- Here's your fiile.

1390
02:00:42.386 --> 02:00:46.459
Magic said to remind you
about Lightning's overdue account.

1391
02:00:46.626 --> 02:00:51.939
You hear that, Lightning?
The cripple wants to collect your debts.

1392
02:00:52.106 --> 02:00:56.622
I'll think about it
if he shows me his falsie.

1393
02:00:56.786 --> 02:00:58.378
Show me your stump.

1394
02:00:58.546 --> 02:01:04.576
Little white Mexican boy came back
just to show us his stump.

1395
02:01:04.746 --> 02:01:09.058
- Get off me, motherfuckers!
- Get his britches off. Stay still!

1396
02:01:09.226 --> 02:01:12.821
- You're crazy to pull this shit!
- I'm scared, punk.

1397
02:01:12.986 --> 02:01:19.334
You didn't fiight when Big Al did this.
He's laughing in his grave.

1398
02:01:19.506 --> 02:01:23.181
- No! Leave it alone!
- Stay still.

1399
02:01:25.386 --> 02:01:27.536
<i>- There she is.
- Fucking puto!</i>

1400
02:01:27.706 --> 02:01:32.860
You ever heard the saying
""put your foot in your mouth''?

1401
02:01:33.026 --> 02:01:35.540
Spit shine that shoe, boy.

1402
02:01:38.026 --> 02:01:41.336
You Polar Bears are gonna pay.

1403
02:01:41.506 --> 02:01:44.896
Look around you, half-breed.
Onda's fiinished!

1404
02:01:45.066 --> 02:01:49.344
Carlos works for us, and every day
he brings more Ondas with him.

1405
02:01:49.506 --> 02:01:52.498
You greasers better wise up.
It's a white world.

1406
02:01:52.666 --> 02:02:00.095
The coloureds serve us. From now on
you're my personal errand boy.

1407
02:02:00.266 --> 02:02:02.985
- You motherfucker!
- Fucking punk!

1408
02:02:03.146 --> 02:02:06.502
Go out for a pass, cripple. Go deep.

1409
02:02:14.866 --> 02:02:19.781
You're back to your true nature.
Crawling like a worm.

1410
02:02:21.826 --> 02:02:26.138
- They put it in my face.
- Understand, your leg is gone.

1411
02:02:26.306 --> 02:02:29.457
You can't be a soldier.
That's why I put you in the library.

1412
02:02:29.626 --> 02:02:32.265
It's not what they did to me, but Onda.

1413
02:02:32.426 --> 02:02:36.135
- We shouldn't have let Carlos go.
- You think I wanted to?

1414
02:02:36.306 --> 02:02:39.662
- Carlos fucked up...bad.
- I'm not saying he didn't.

1415
02:02:39.826 --> 02:02:43.057
He knew whoever controls
the drugs controls everything.

1416
02:02:43.226 --> 02:02:46.502
Old drug dealers don't exist.

1417
02:02:46.666 --> 02:02:51.581
<i>Let's wait. In fiive years Chicanos will
be the majority in southwest pintas.</i>

1418
02:02:51.746 --> 02:02:57.537
This is now. What good is it
if we're slaves for the BGA and AVers?

1419
02:02:57.706 --> 02:03:02.097
- We gotta take power now!
- We've only fought each other.

1420
02:03:02.266 --> 02:03:08.614
Our best ending up in pools of blood
for smokes and a snort of coca?

1421
02:03:09.706 --> 02:03:12.698
I dunno where you're coming from.

1422
02:03:21.266 --> 02:03:26.818
A Chicana from Cal State published
my essay on prison reform.

1423
02:03:27.026 --> 02:03:31.895
They want me to write a book
on the Chicano in prison.

1424
02:03:34.466 --> 02:03:40.621
Lift your eyes outta this book and
see what's going on around us now.

1425
02:03:45.666 --> 02:03:49.375
Hurry up, gentlemen. Let's go. Move it.

1426
02:03:49.546 --> 02:03:53.175
Hey, Bonafiide!
When's the BGA gonna pay its tab?

1427
02:03:53.346 --> 02:03:58.739
<i>No can do, carnal.
I can take care of a quarter, maybe.</i>

1428
02:03:58.906 --> 02:04:01.704
Endugu, you forgot your comb.

1429
02:04:03.066 --> 02:04:04.897
Maybe.

1430
02:04:06.306 --> 02:04:11.175
<i>Thinks he's getting away
with something. Pinche mayate!</i>

1431
02:04:11.346 --> 02:04:14.144
Hey, Magic! Help me out.

1432
02:04:29.666 --> 02:04:33.261
- Now the AVers won't pay, either.
- Why pay?

1433
02:04:33.426 --> 02:04:36.179
They tested us with Carlos
and we folded.

1434
02:04:36.346 --> 02:04:41.101
- They'll pick us apart.
- La Onda is falling apart.

1435
02:04:42.826 --> 02:04:46.182
Like it or not,
the dope business is where it's at.

1436
02:04:46.346 --> 02:04:50.942
If the AVers and the BGA control it,
they control everything. Including us.

1437
02:04:51.106 --> 02:04:53.666
Fuckin' A. Carlitos was right.

1438
02:04:53.826 --> 02:04:57.660
No, he was stupid
for selling out to the AVers.

1439
02:05:01.066 --> 02:05:05.298
Onda should take the money
left in the book and make a buy.

1440
02:05:05.466 --> 02:05:08.503
- Yeah.
- I know a connection.

1441
02:05:09.506 --> 02:05:15.297
- But the council won't approve it.
- Let's do it anyway.

1442
02:05:17.386 --> 02:05:22.141
<i>- You wanna die, ése?
- If I have to, I will!</i>

1443
02:05:22.306 --> 02:05:27.505
I lost my leg, my family back home!
This is all I got left.

1444
02:05:27.666 --> 02:05:31.375
If we don't act now, Onda dies.
You want that?

1445
02:05:37.986 --> 02:05:44.664
Magic, I love Montana, too. But I ain't
gonna stand and watch them destroy us.

1446
02:05:49.426 --> 02:05:52.623
<i>Will you stand with me, carnal?</i>

1447
02:05:53.466 --> 02:05:56.060
Can I trust you?

1448
02:05:59.746 --> 02:06:02.465
I'll back you with my life.

1449
02:06:04.466 --> 02:06:08.459
There's only two of us.
We gotta wait for an opening.

1450
02:06:09.066 --> 02:06:13.378
<i>The Aryan Vanguard'll push Carlos
to move soon on the BGA.</i>

1451
02:06:13.546 --> 02:06:15.423
<i>His first target'll be Pockets.</i>

1452
02:06:15.586 --> 02:06:18.658
I told you to stop bridging, punk!

1453
02:06:20.066 --> 02:06:24.344
Better watch your back,
'cause I'm gonna ride you.

1454
02:06:24.506 --> 02:06:28.545
You're right. I don't want any trouble.
I'll change my ways.

1455
02:06:35.506 --> 02:06:38.259
Now I'm taking all your customers.

1456
02:06:39.746 --> 02:06:42.385
Say anything and you're dead!

1457
02:06:43.066 --> 02:06:47.582
<i>At the same time he hits Pockets,
Smokey will move on Cheap Times.</i>

1458
02:06:47.746 --> 02:06:50.101
<i>The BGA 's drug store down in LA</i>

1459
02:07:01.786 --> 02:07:04.459
Brought you monkeys some coconuts.

1460
02:07:04.626 --> 02:07:07.265
From Quentin.

1461
02:07:20.426 --> 02:07:25.375
<i>The problem is that Carlos is
so strung out he can't see the danger.</i>

1462
02:07:25.786 --> 02:07:31.577
<i>When Carlos does the A Vers'dirty work,
Ryder will pull his protection.</i>

1463
02:07:31.746 --> 02:07:35.056
<i>It'll be open season
on Carlos Zúniga.</i>

1464
02:07:36.546 --> 02:07:38.901
- Carlos!
- No!

1465
02:07:47.266 --> 02:07:50.383
<i>If I'm right, all hell will break loose.</i>

1466
02:07:50.546 --> 02:07:54.539
<i>That's our chance, Magic.
Where there's war, there's opportunity.</i>

1467
02:07:54.706 --> 02:07:58.619
<i>All we gotta do is wake Montana up
and move Onda into power.</i>

1468
02:07:58.786 --> 02:08:02.461
Prepare for a war.
But don't attack yet.

1469
02:08:02.626 --> 02:08:07.620
Our people are getting iced
without mercy.

1470
02:08:07.786 --> 02:08:10.459
Carlos started a war
with the BGA, we didn't.

1471
02:08:10.626 --> 02:08:12.344
Enough words. Let's take 'em now.

1472
02:08:12.506 --> 02:08:14.337
No! Listen!

1473
02:08:14.506 --> 02:08:17.543
Before we fuck up everything,
I must meet the BGA.

1474
02:08:20.226 --> 02:08:23.298
We're making a horrible mistake!
You understand?

1475
02:08:23.466 --> 02:08:26.424
- You blind or what?
- Wait! I said I want you ready!

1476
02:08:26.586 --> 02:08:29.737
<i>I'm not gonna waste soldados' lives
for nothing! First we talk!</i>

1477
02:08:29.906 --> 02:08:34.058
- We fiight only if we have to!
- The time to strike is now!

1478
02:08:34.226 --> 02:08:38.458
<i>No, Magic! If El Mero Mero says
meet with the BGA, we gotta do it.</i>

1479
02:08:38.626 --> 02:08:42.505
What are you talking about?
Onda will go down in flames.

1480
02:08:42.666 --> 02:08:46.261
Magic! We trust each other
with our lives.

1481
02:08:48.506 --> 02:08:50.940
Remember?

1482
02:08:52.826 --> 02:08:58.139
- I want Smokey dead by tomorrow.
- Órale.

1483
02:08:58.306 --> 02:09:01.582
<i>- You set up a meeting with Bonafiide.
- Sí, mon, jefe.</i>

1484
02:09:06.546 --> 02:09:09.777
<i>Three California prisoners
were killed in gang violence,</i>

1485
02:09:09.946 --> 02:09:12.506
<i>bringing the tally this week to eleven.</i>

1486
02:09:12.666 --> 02:09:14.896
Aguilar!

1487
02:09:16.266 --> 02:09:20.259
- Aguilar.
- Hey, Chorizo. You still want Popeye?

1488
02:09:20.426 --> 02:09:23.020
- Zúniga?
- He got a hit on me.

1489
02:09:23.186 --> 02:09:25.905
I need protection or I'm dead.

1490
02:09:26.066 --> 02:09:31.015
If you want protection I want more than
Popeye. I want everything on Onda.

1491
02:09:31.186 --> 02:09:34.542
- Who they are and where they are.
- No way.

1492
02:09:34.706 --> 02:09:38.984
Don't talk shit. You stay out there
alone and you're dead.

1493
02:09:39.146 --> 02:09:41.501
All right. All right!

1494
02:09:41.666 --> 02:09:46.342
<i>I'll give you the whole layout.
Capitanes, soldados...</i>

1495
02:09:46.506 --> 02:09:49.339
- But I gotta be outta state fiirst.
- Where do we meet?

1496
02:09:49.506 --> 02:09:51.781
<i>The church at 4th and Chicago.</i>

1497
02:09:51.946 --> 02:09:55.097
<i>- I know it.
- Be there in fifteen or forget about it.</i>

1498
02:09:55.266 --> 02:09:57.826
I'll be there.

1499
02:11:00.386 --> 02:11:01.978
Aguilar!

1500
02:11:04.906 --> 02:11:07.101
This is Lieutenant Burnett
from San Quentin.

1501
02:11:07.266 --> 02:11:10.815
- Detective Paco Aguilar.
- This the victim?

1502
02:11:10.986 --> 02:11:15.059
Paco, Sacramento says we must
cooperate with Corrections on this.

1503
02:11:15.226 --> 02:11:17.740
That means Burnett's bringing
his whole team.

1504
02:11:17.906 --> 02:11:21.785
I'm out of it? This is bullshit, Captain.

1505
02:11:21.946 --> 02:11:23.982
I've been on this case for months.

1506
02:11:24.146 --> 02:11:26.979
<i>This vato was gonna give me
the full low-down on Onda.</i>

1507
02:11:27.146 --> 02:11:29.376
What do you know about Onda?

1508
02:11:29.546 --> 02:11:33.141
I had a run-in with a couple of guys here.

1509
02:11:35.186 --> 02:11:37.859
- The whole council. I need this picture.
- Fine.

1510
02:11:38.026 --> 02:11:41.336
- My chief investigator will debrief him.
- Wait a minute.

1511
02:11:41.506 --> 02:11:46.580
- This is an East LA case.
- This is much bigger than East LA

1512
02:11:46.746 --> 02:11:48.657
Things are popping up all over.

1513
02:11:48.826 --> 02:11:53.900
You hear about the grenade
at Cheap Times last night?

1514
02:11:55.426 --> 02:11:58.259
I bet Zúniga here was the quarterback.

1515
02:11:58.426 --> 02:12:01.896
A plot of his brother's in Quentin.
It all comes outta Q

1516
02:12:02.066 --> 02:12:05.342
- Let's get inside.
- It's here, not Quentin.

1517
02:12:05.506 --> 02:12:09.738
Prison gangs are complicated
so we're taking over.

1518
02:12:10.746 --> 02:12:15.183
- You speak Spanish? Been in a gang?
- No, my Chicano warden has.

1519
02:12:15.346 --> 02:12:18.065
Is he related to someone
on the Onda council?

1520
02:12:18.226 --> 02:12:24.017
Miklo Velka's my cousin.
I'm related to him by blood and by this.

1521
02:12:24.186 --> 02:12:29.465
I don't mean any disrespect,
but I think I can get further.

1522
02:12:29.626 --> 02:12:32.857
All I'm asking is that I'm involved.

1523
02:12:37.866 --> 02:12:39.424
Thank you.

1524
02:12:40.866 --> 02:12:45.656
There is no war, Bonafiide. It was
personal between Carlos and Pockets.

1525
02:12:45.826 --> 02:12:49.023
They were loose cannons.
That was business.

1526
02:12:49.186 --> 02:12:52.019
What you did in LA was bullshit.

1527
02:12:52.186 --> 02:12:55.735
There's gonna be more blood.
You ain't hitting us in the back.

1528
02:12:55.906 --> 02:12:58.466
You wanna pow-wow or talk?
Go ahead.

1529
02:12:58.626 --> 02:13:01.459
Onda had nothing
to do with Cheap Times.

1530
02:13:01.626 --> 02:13:06.461
Carlos' brother acted on his orders,
not Onda's, so now he's dead.

1531
02:13:06.626 --> 02:13:09.060
Cheap Times means cheap lives.

1532
02:13:09.226 --> 02:13:12.855
We're ready for war.
Believe me, we'll win.

1533
02:13:13.026 --> 02:13:15.665
Our soldiers will go all the way.

1534
02:13:15.826 --> 02:13:19.341
- To the death.
- My soldiers are ready to die, too.

1535
02:13:19.506 --> 02:13:23.181
Is that what you want? I guarantee
that's what the Aryans want.

1536
02:13:23.346 --> 02:13:27.259
We can stop the killing now.
You and me.

1537
02:13:27.586 --> 02:13:29.577
Right here.

1538
02:13:32.826 --> 02:13:36.739
Your word means something here.
What about Folsom and Chino?

1539
02:13:36.906 --> 02:13:39.500
I speak for them, too.

1540
02:13:39.666 --> 02:13:42.544
Maybe for Folsom,
but your word ain't reaching Chino.

1541
02:13:42.706 --> 02:13:46.335
Mosca López is crazy.
I lost three people there.

1542
02:13:47.426 --> 02:13:52.546
I can ask for a temporary transfer.
You must guarantee peace when I go.

1543
02:13:52.706 --> 02:13:56.460
- Fuck a truce, we cannot...
- Yanco!

1544
02:13:58.946 --> 02:14:02.143
Man, you got fiive days.

1545
02:14:02.306 --> 02:14:07.664
I'll hold my side off for fiive days.
Five days...

1546
02:14:11.186 --> 02:14:14.542
Miklo will run Onda business
in my absence.

1547
02:14:14.706 --> 02:14:17.778
He'll make sure nothing happens.

1548
02:14:20.666 --> 02:14:24.739
- Do we have a truce?
- Right on.

1549
02:14:25.626 --> 02:14:27.059
Well, well, well.

1550
02:14:27.226 --> 02:14:30.696
Wetbacks and Bonafiide
porch monkeys holding hands.

1551
02:14:33.586 --> 02:14:35.895
You now have a combined IQ of two.

1552
02:14:36.066 --> 02:14:40.662
- You're a dead man, Wonder Bread!
- Kiss my enriched white ass!

1553
02:14:40.826 --> 02:14:44.580
Here's my coon dog.
Get them coons, boy!

1554
02:14:45.626 --> 02:14:49.505
- Hey, Ryder! What's going on?
- Don't ask me, man!

1555
02:14:49.666 --> 02:14:51.577
Ask us? It's their war!

1556
02:14:51.746 --> 02:14:54.544
Run 'em out the bay,
save taxpayers' money!

1557
02:14:54.706 --> 02:14:56.219
Clear the yard!

1558
02:14:56.386 --> 02:15:01.221
It's between the niggers and spics!
We're white, you motherfuckers!

1559
02:15:01.386 --> 02:15:05.265
<i>- Jefe, will Bonafiide listen to me?
- Magic and the rest are warriors.</i>

1560
02:15:05.426 --> 02:15:08.179
If I put one of them in charge,
Bonafiide wouldn't trust me.

1561
02:15:08.346 --> 02:15:12.817
You're a jailhouse lawyer, a counsellor.
He knows you'll follow my wishes.

1562
02:15:12.986 --> 02:15:16.899
What if he's lying?
What if the BGA doesn't want peace?

1563
02:15:17.066 --> 02:15:20.376
Nobody here knows what peace is.
They've never had it.

1564
02:15:20.546 --> 02:15:23.060
<i>I'm talking about power, carnal.</i>

1565
02:15:23.226 --> 02:15:30.223
The only way to gain real power is
for black and brown to come together.

1566
02:15:30.386 --> 02:15:33.583
I thought Popeye Savedra
was the Onda leader.

1567
02:15:33.746 --> 02:15:37.978
- It's hard to buy it's that little man.
- You better believe it.

1568
02:15:40.226 --> 02:15:42.456
He's got what you call charisma.

1569
02:15:42.626 --> 02:15:46.778
- Can he stop the violence?
- Montana makes you want to listen.

1570
02:15:46.946 --> 02:15:50.495
Got a lot of heart.
If anyone can stop this war it's him.

1571
02:15:50.666 --> 02:15:53.897
I can always bring in the guns,
but I'd rather it be him.

1572
02:15:54.066 --> 02:15:59.015
I don't like you travelling alone.
I don't trust anybody.

1573
02:15:59.186 --> 02:16:02.940
Don't worry. The warden's
guaranteeing my passage.

1574
02:16:03.106 --> 02:16:05.666
Top secret route.

1575
02:16:08.706 --> 02:16:11.015
<i>I made a deal with the vato.</i>

1576
02:16:11.186 --> 02:16:15.225
I get to spend the night in Delano.
See my daughter.

1577
02:16:17.546 --> 02:16:21.334
After fourteen years. Can you believe it?

1578
02:16:21.506 --> 02:16:24.657
Come on, Segura. Move it!

1579
02:16:31.706 --> 02:16:37.702
<i>Watcha. Tell those vatos to fiind some
shade and chill out till I get back.</i>

1580
02:16:37.866 --> 02:16:39.663
You got it.

1581
02:16:45.626 --> 02:16:51.895
- What time's my daughter coming?
- About seven o'clock.

1582
02:17:03.146 --> 02:17:06.138
We'll rack you at six
tomorrow for a shower.

1583
02:17:06.306 --> 02:17:08.103
I'll be waiting.

1584
02:17:13.106 --> 02:17:15.666
- Name's Wallace.
- Montana.

1585
02:17:16.426 --> 02:17:21.500
You ain't got any street smokes?
This state tobacco will kill you.

1586
02:17:21.666 --> 02:17:23.657
I don't smoke.

1587
02:17:24.986 --> 02:17:27.375
You don't smoke, huh?

1588
02:17:27.546 --> 02:17:32.745
Man, I can't wait to get outta here
so I can fiind me a fiield crew.

1589
02:17:32.906 --> 02:17:37.616
Do me some pickin' so I can send
my old lady some money.

1590
02:17:37.786 --> 02:17:40.778
I used to pick when I was a kid.

1591
02:17:40.946 --> 02:17:45.736
I been following this crop all my life.
If it ain't that, I takes me a drink.

1592
02:17:45.906 --> 02:17:51.185
If it ain't that,
I'm behind bars trying to dry out.

1593
02:17:52.626 --> 02:17:55.982
You ever pick any grapes, Wallace?

1594
02:17:57.746 --> 02:18:03.378
I ain't never picked no grapes,
but I cut me a bunch.

1595
02:18:03.546 --> 02:18:05.423
Yeah.

1596
02:18:13.946 --> 02:18:17.495
- Here.
- Oh, man.

1597
02:18:19.946 --> 02:18:23.018
Say, amigo, you mind if I have two?

1598
02:18:23.186 --> 02:18:25.859
Keep the pack. They're only for trade.

1599
02:18:26.026 --> 02:18:27.584
Lights out!

1600
02:18:29.466 --> 02:18:33.664
When I was a kid, I loved to pick.

1601
02:18:35.146 --> 02:18:40.174
Nothing like fresh vegetables
and fruit ripe from the vine.

1602
02:18:42.586 --> 02:18:44.099
Yeah.

1603
02:18:53.946 --> 02:18:57.143
The escort's coming.
You have one hour with your father.

1604
02:18:57.306 --> 02:18:59.376
- Let's go!
- I'd like two seconds to...

1605
02:18:59.546 --> 02:19:02.379
I don't care who you are in Quentin.
You're nobody here.

1606
02:19:02.546 --> 02:19:07.904
Offiicer, I haven't seen her in fourteen
years. Can I just straighten up?

1607
02:19:08.066 --> 02:19:09.738
Please?

1608
02:19:14.586 --> 02:19:18.181
I'll put your daughter in the visiting
room. You got one hour.

1609
02:19:18.346 --> 02:19:20.143
The clock is ticking.

1610
02:19:20.306 --> 02:19:23.184
One hour! I'll be right back.

1611
02:19:25.386 --> 02:19:28.139
Mornin', Montana.

1612
02:19:28.306 --> 02:19:30.774
Morning, Wallace.

1613
02:19:30.946 --> 02:19:34.302
They bothering you early in the mornin'?

1614
02:19:35.706 --> 02:19:41.542
No. I'm not gonna let anything
ruin a good day.

1615
02:19:43.066 --> 02:19:47.776
- Them damn short-handle hoes!
- I used a few of those myself.

1616
02:19:51.426 --> 02:19:54.577
Hey, amigo. Why don't you use this?

1617
02:19:56.386 --> 02:19:59.935
Yeah, I'll hold it for you.

1618
02:20:01.146 --> 02:20:03.182
Thank you.

1619
02:20:03.346 --> 02:20:05.940
<i>Chingo de tiempo
since I felt this good.</i>

1620
02:20:06.106 --> 02:20:11.544
- My daughter's coming today.
- Man, today's gonna be good for you.

1621
02:20:11.706 --> 02:20:14.937
Your daughter's gonna be
so proud of you.

1622
02:20:17.426 --> 02:20:20.338
This is what they call a change of plan.

1623
02:20:20.866 --> 02:20:24.097
For Cheap Times! For Cheap Times!

1624
02:20:25.226 --> 02:20:28.935
Son of a bitch. Motherfucker think
you can blow up my brother?

1625
02:20:30.066 --> 02:20:36.062
You can go join your maker now.
For what falls to the floor is his.

1626
02:20:36.226 --> 02:20:39.218
Don't forget your smokes.

1627
02:21:41.466 --> 02:21:45.778
How'd you know the head of La Onda
was in Delano?

1628
02:21:45.946 --> 02:21:51.100
Man, I don't give a goddamn who
that taco-eating motherfucker was.

1629
02:21:51.266 --> 02:21:54.815
Do you know who that taco-eating
motherfucker was that you killed?

1630
02:21:54.986 --> 02:21:56.817
Your mama.

1631
02:21:56.986 --> 02:22:01.138
- I gonna stay here all day till you talk...
- He won't crack.

1632
02:22:01.306 --> 02:22:03.979
Nope. Been in for thirty years.

1633
02:22:04.146 --> 02:22:06.535
Tough as three-inch steel.

1634
02:22:07.546 --> 02:22:10.697
- I'm gonna bust your ass.
- I'll be here.

1635
02:22:17.026 --> 02:22:18.937
Come in here.

1636
02:22:20.626 --> 02:22:23.584
That's the man who ordered it.
Bring him here.

1637
02:22:23.746 --> 02:22:26.977
- Tell him what you told me.
- I didn't order no hit.

1638
02:22:27.146 --> 02:22:31.537
- It'd be like throwing gasoline on fiire.
- Don't bullshit me.

1639
02:22:31.706 --> 02:22:34.300
He's BGA. He made the hit.

1640
02:22:34.466 --> 02:22:40.416
I know you ain't no sucker. If I wanted
Montana, I'd have used a freelancer.

1641
02:22:40.586 --> 02:22:45.421
An AVer, so it couldn't be traced.
I'm not stupid, sir.

1642
02:22:45.586 --> 02:22:48.578
That's enough. Come with me.

1643
02:22:52.946 --> 02:22:57.019
- Is that your man?
- Yeah, that's him. Let me talk to him.

1644
02:22:57.186 --> 02:23:01.464
- No way!
- He ain't gonna tell you nothing.

1645
02:23:01.626 --> 02:23:04.777
You wanna get to the bottom of this?

1646
02:23:04.946 --> 02:23:10.066
I know he'll talk to me. Your call.

1647
02:23:21.546 --> 02:23:24.936
<i>- Vipi sassu Ndugu.
- Saawa tu, brother.</i>

1648
02:23:29.746 --> 02:23:33.978
Goddamn, the man got you
down here, too?

1649
02:23:40.066 --> 02:23:43.502
Why you hit Montana?

1650
02:23:43.706 --> 02:23:46.778
The man got his eyes and ears
in the wall.

1651
02:23:46.946 --> 02:23:51.019
Don't sweat, brother.
I'm gonna maintain.

1652
02:23:51.186 --> 02:23:53.654
Who ordered the hit?

1653
02:23:55.106 --> 02:23:58.655
- You did?
- Come here.

1654
02:24:03.266 --> 02:24:05.985
You did, Bonafiide! You did!

1655
02:24:06.146 --> 02:24:10.105
- You did! I got your kite, man.
- I didn't send you nothing.

1656
02:24:10.266 --> 02:24:13.303
- Who ordered it?
- You did, I got your comb!

1657
02:24:13.466 --> 02:24:15.741
I know your design.

1658
02:24:15.906 --> 02:24:18.978
- You got my comb?
- I opened it up, read the message.

1659
02:24:19.146 --> 02:24:22.138
I burned it. It was your comb.

1660
02:24:24.266 --> 02:24:28.657
We got fiive minutes. I'm here to talk
to you about Montana's murder.

1661
02:24:28.826 --> 02:24:31.624
Who are you to come here like this?

1662
02:24:31.786 --> 02:24:35.540
- He's not your fucking business.
- You gotta listen to me, Miklo.

1663
02:24:35.706 --> 02:24:39.779
Someone copied Bonafiide's comb
and put in an order to hit Montana.

1664
02:24:39.946 --> 02:24:42.540
- The BGA didn't do it.
- Bullshit!

1665
02:24:42.706 --> 02:24:46.699
- We know they killed him.
- The Administration doesn't think so.

1666
02:24:46.866 --> 02:24:52.543
If they're right, do you want to start
a war against the wrong people?

1667
02:24:53.906 --> 02:24:56.340
Listen, I know you hate me.

1668
02:24:56.506 --> 02:25:01.261
I shot your leg. I have to live with that.
But you're still my blood.

1669
02:25:01.426 --> 02:25:04.498
I'm not gonna watch you
destroy yourself.

1670
02:25:04.666 --> 02:25:08.215
If you start this war,
you will be committing suicide.

1671
02:25:08.386 --> 02:25:14.143
Look over there. See the warden?
He ain't afraid to use his fiirepower.

1672
02:25:14.306 --> 02:25:16.615
You want that?

1673
02:25:18.466 --> 02:25:21.185
You're the man now, aren't you?

1674
02:25:21.346 --> 02:25:25.737
Montana left you in charge.
A real leader protects his people.

1675
02:25:25.906 --> 02:25:29.945
Meet with Bonafiide.
What have you got to lose?

1676
02:25:34.226 --> 02:25:39.380
I'll meet him in the yard.
One lieutenant each. No guards around.

1677
02:25:39.546 --> 02:25:43.539
That's far enough!
Leave them on their own!

1678
02:25:52.106 --> 02:25:55.143
I swear to you it wasn't the BGA.

1679
02:25:55.306 --> 02:25:58.184
Montana was a stand-up dude.
We were set up.

1680
02:25:58.346 --> 02:26:01.179
That old man was no punk.
He was hardcore BGA.

1681
02:26:01.346 --> 02:26:04.179
That's why it don't make no sense.

1682
02:26:04.346 --> 02:26:07.975
I take out Montana with my own man?
That's suicide.

1683
02:26:08.146 --> 02:26:10.376
Do what you wanna do.

1684
02:26:10.546 --> 02:26:16.416
But think about who gains
if BGA and Onda war.

1685
02:26:17.546 --> 02:26:19.377
The fucking AV.

1686
02:26:19.546 --> 02:26:23.698
We take each other out,
then they step in and take over.

1687
02:26:23.866 --> 02:26:26.664
We go back to being slaves.

1688
02:26:26.826 --> 02:26:28.623
The AVers.

1689
02:26:28.786 --> 02:26:33.177
The only ones who could've got
Montana's route from the white guards.

1690
02:26:33.346 --> 02:26:35.177
I work with Lightning in the wood shop.

1691
02:26:35.346 --> 02:26:40.466
He gets my comb, counterfeits it,
sends it to Wallace.

1692
02:26:42.186 --> 02:26:44.939
- It's possible.
- Now Red Ryder...

1693
02:26:45.106 --> 02:26:48.462
...sitting in a front row seat
waiting on us to take each other out.

1694
02:26:48.626 --> 02:26:52.699
- What do you propose?
- Hit the motherfuckers together.

1695
02:26:52.866 --> 02:26:56.859
We do to them what
they're tryin' to do to us.

1696
02:26:58.626 --> 02:27:00.935
<i>You see those pinche vultures?</i>

1697
02:27:01.106 --> 02:27:05.099
They're watching us
with a magnifying glass.

1698
02:27:05.266 --> 02:27:10.135
So for the next six months
we'll be good neighbours.

1699
02:27:10.306 --> 02:27:14.777
- So we got a deal? We join forces?
- Yeah.

1700
02:27:14.946 --> 02:27:17.744
We'll celebrate a big
Mexican holiday together.

1701
02:27:17.906 --> 02:27:20.579
Which one you talking about?

1702
02:27:20.746 --> 02:27:24.022
<i>- Día de los Muertos.
- That means what, now?</i>

1703
02:27:24.186 --> 02:27:29.340
- Day of the Dead.
- All right.

1704
02:27:31.266 --> 02:27:33.018
Right.

1705
02:27:35.586 --> 02:27:39.465
- In six months.
- My man.

1706
02:27:39.626 --> 02:27:44.620
- They're shaking hands. We got a truce.
- Don't congratulate ourselves too soon.

1707
02:27:50.346 --> 02:27:53.702
- I don't trust that dude.
- This boy's in way over his head.

1708
02:27:53.866 --> 02:27:56.539
His only choice is to go with us now.

1709
02:27:56.706 --> 02:27:59.584
<i>Take out the AVers and
the mayates are stronger.</i>

1710
02:27:59.746 --> 02:28:05.264
It's OK. When you expect nothing
and get everything, that's destiny.

1711
02:28:05.426 --> 02:28:12.025
BGA will help us take out the AVers.
We throw some white meat to the dogs.

1712
02:28:12.186 --> 02:28:14.984
Then we'll rob the house.

1713
02:28:17.106 --> 02:28:20.815
- Have our soldiers ready.
- Órale.

1714
02:28:33.506 --> 02:28:37.818
<i>- Gracias, carnal. You were right.
- You did the right thing.</i>

1715
02:28:37.986 --> 02:28:42.980
- Tell your mom I love her, OK?
- Take care of yourself.

1716
02:28:55.346 --> 02:28:59.259
<i>I was a bad man
Don't deny my disgrace</i>

1717
02:28:59.426 --> 02:29:03.305
<i>Let me be punished for all time</i>

1718
02:29:04.666 --> 02:29:08.705
<i>I ask God, begging on my knees</i>

1719
02:29:08.866 --> 02:29:13.701
<i>Don't let my mother suffer for what I did</i>

1720
02:29:13.866 --> 02:29:17.575
<i>I would do penance
on my knees for ever</i>

1721
02:29:17.746 --> 02:29:22.501
<i>If only my sweet mother
would cease to weep</i>

1722
02:29:25.426 --> 02:29:27.496
Juanito,Juanito.

1723
02:29:29.826 --> 02:29:33.501
Hey, homes.
If anyone messes with you...

1724
02:29:34.906 --> 02:29:37.704
...just hit 'em where it hurts.

1725
02:30:04.306 --> 02:30:08.424
<i>I'm sorry, amá. Perdóname.</i>

1726
02:30:09.346 --> 02:30:12.463
<i>- I loved Juanito.
- I know, mijo.</i>

1727
02:30:12.626 --> 02:30:14.981
<i>I loved him, amá.</i>

1728
02:30:41.266 --> 02:30:42.858
<i>I'm sorry, apá.</i>

1729
02:30:45.426 --> 02:30:49.260
<i>I missed you. Mi familia.</i>

1730
02:31:04.146 --> 02:31:07.104
...she's got eye-hooks
drilled in the door,

1731
02:31:07.266 --> 02:31:09.621
she's got thongs, I swear to God.

1732
02:31:09.786 --> 02:31:13.620
She absolutely loved it.
She became orange juice...

1733
02:31:59.066 --> 02:32:00.818
You got it. One more.

1734
02:32:08.706 --> 02:32:13.177
Hey! No more, man,
I'm through. That's it.

1735
02:32:13.946 --> 02:32:19.578
Ten cents a fucking hour. That spic
warden ain't getting overtime outta me.

1736
02:32:24.866 --> 02:32:28.256
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1737
02:32:28.426 --> 02:32:32.578
You stupid fucking asshole!
It's in my eyes...

1738
02:32:46.666 --> 02:32:48.782
We keep our mouths shut.

1739
02:32:48.946 --> 02:32:51.824
Then there'll be no problem
when the shit goes down.

1740
02:32:51.986 --> 02:32:55.820
- Your plan will work, Bonafiide.
- We keep our stake together.

1741
02:32:55.986 --> 02:32:59.774
- Then we control the whole joint, right?
- All right.

1742
02:33:42.786 --> 02:33:44.378
For Montana.

1743
02:33:49.906 --> 02:33:52.739
- Look at this!
- It's unbelievable.

1744
02:33:52.906 --> 02:33:54.862
Every hit was strategic.

1745
02:33:55.026 --> 02:33:59.224
First they knocked off the AV leadership,
then fiinished off the BGA.

1746
02:33:59.386 --> 02:34:02.856
I don't like being lied to.
Break up the Onda council.

1747
02:34:03.026 --> 02:34:06.621
Use Interstate Compact
to get 'em out this week.

1748
02:34:08.426 --> 02:34:10.781
Taxpayers save another $3 million.

1749
02:34:10.946 --> 02:34:14.621
- It's all a joke. What's your problem?
- My problem?

1750
02:34:14.786 --> 02:34:17.619
- You got a problem!
- You don't understand!

1751
02:34:17.786 --> 02:34:21.176
That little bastard's
playing God with his army.

1752
02:34:21.346 --> 02:34:23.940
I don't ever understand!

1753
02:34:24.106 --> 02:34:27.940
As long as he's behind bars,
it's not gonna affect us!

1754
02:34:28.106 --> 02:34:31.462
It won't affect any of us, will it?

1755
02:34:58.706 --> 02:35:00.742
You used me.

1756
02:35:00.906 --> 02:35:04.785
I tried to save your life,
and you used me to set up the BGA.

1757
02:35:04.946 --> 02:35:09.497
They would've got us otherwise.
I did it for my brothers to survive.

1758
02:35:09.666 --> 02:35:14.182
Your brothers? What am I, Miklo?
You grew up with me.

1759
02:35:14.346 --> 02:35:17.941
You slept in my room,
wore my fucking clothes.

1760
02:35:18.106 --> 02:35:22.065
You used your own flesh and blood
to massacre all those people.

1761
02:35:22.226 --> 02:35:25.821
I didn't want to hurt you.
You use what you've got.

1762
02:35:25.986 --> 02:35:29.456
<i>Without your help,
a lot of carnales would have died.</i>

1763
02:35:29.626 --> 02:35:33.255
<i>- Gracias...
- Don't thank me. I hate what you did.</i>

1764
02:35:33.426 --> 02:35:36.418
I hate what you stand for.

1765
02:35:37.586 --> 02:35:41.977
I know, Paquito.
For a long time I hated you.

1766
02:35:42.146 --> 02:35:44.979
I blamed you for everything.

1767
02:35:45.146 --> 02:35:48.855
But then I realised something
that changed my life.

1768
02:35:49.026 --> 02:35:55.022
Everything you did, even shooting
my leg, forced me into my destiny.

1769
02:35:55.186 --> 02:36:00.101
Made me discover myself.
Find my real family. My home.

1770
02:36:00.266 --> 02:36:01.904
Here.

1771
02:36:02.066 --> 02:36:05.695
<i>Inside these walls
I found the strength of la raza.</i>

1772
02:36:05.866 --> 02:36:09.495
<i>You got no fuckin' idea
what la raza means.</i>

1773
02:36:09.666 --> 02:36:15.343
It's about our people out there.
Working, surviving, with pride and dignity.

1774
02:36:15.506 --> 02:36:18.578
Not lying and murdering.

1775
02:36:18.746 --> 02:36:22.819
All you got is your white father's hate.

1776
02:36:22.986 --> 02:36:27.343
<i>Still hung up
on my fluorescent skin, vato?</i>

1777
02:36:27.506 --> 02:36:29.303
He wasn't my real father.

1778
02:36:29.466 --> 02:36:31.104
Montana was.

1779
02:36:31.266 --> 02:36:35.498
He taught me about respect.
You gotta be willing to die for it.

1780
02:36:35.666 --> 02:36:39.898
Like you. Not deserting me
after the car crash.

1781
02:36:40.066 --> 02:36:46.744
<i>That was real respect for a brother.
And I'll always love you for it, carnal.</i>

1782
02:36:46.906 --> 02:36:50.376
It's not about drive-bys and gang fiights...

1783
02:36:50.546 --> 02:36:53.538
<i>Let's stop fiighting, carnal! We're family!</i>

1784
02:36:53.706 --> 02:36:58.541
We should help each other,
not cut each other's throats.

1785
02:37:00.226 --> 02:37:02.421
Let's be brothers again.

1786
02:37:08.666 --> 02:37:14.741
Just 'cause you're a cop and I'm a con,
doesn't mean we can't cooperate.

1787
02:37:14.906 --> 02:37:21.061
I can give you tips from inside
to really help you out on the street.

1788
02:37:21.226 --> 02:37:27.699
You got a lot of power out there.
Your advice would be invaluable to me.

1789
02:37:28.666 --> 02:37:32.295
You asking me to be
a member of your gang?

1790
02:37:32.466 --> 02:37:34.934
Are you outta your fucking mind?

1791
02:37:35.106 --> 02:37:38.496
Remember how we took out
Spider for Cruz?

1792
02:37:38.666 --> 02:37:41.578
Together, Paco, we're unbeatable.

1793
02:37:45.866 --> 02:37:50.462
Your Onda's not my Onda
and it never will be.

1794
02:37:52.346 --> 02:37:54.621
Paco!

1795
02:37:57.226 --> 02:38:00.263
<i>I'll always be your brother, vato loco.</i>

1796
02:38:01.026 --> 02:38:02.698
Never.

1797
02:38:11.666 --> 02:38:13.941
<i>- Órale.
- They're watching.</i>

1798
02:38:14.106 --> 02:38:16.176
I know they are. Let 'em watch.

1799
02:38:16.706 --> 02:38:20.824
The show's just beginning.
They don't even know it.

1800
02:38:20.986 --> 02:38:25.457
<i>This may be our last meeting, carnales.</i>

1801
02:38:25.626 --> 02:38:27.981
They're trying to break Onda up.

1802
02:38:28.146 --> 02:38:32.662
But you know what?
They're only helping us grow.

1803
02:38:33.946 --> 02:38:39.578
They're exchanging each of you
from out of state for cons from Califas.

1804
02:38:40.746 --> 02:38:43.579
Chivo, they're sending you to Arizona.

1805
02:38:43.746 --> 02:38:47.739
<i>- Ése, cómo dices?
- We can't do nothing. You gotta go.</i>

1806
02:38:47.906 --> 02:38:52.184
You'll be near your mom.
If she needs anything, let me know.

1807
02:38:56.826 --> 02:38:59.818
Geronimo goes back to Texas.

1808
02:39:00.346 --> 02:39:03.622
<i>- Straighten your son out. Que no?
- Sí, mon.</i>

1809
02:39:06.266 --> 02:39:12.262
They're trying to break up La Onda!
But we're gonna turn it on 'em.

1810
02:39:12.426 --> 02:39:15.782
You know how we're gonna do that?

1811
02:39:15.946 --> 02:39:20.019
Each of you is gonna establish
your own chapters.

1812
02:39:20.186 --> 02:39:25.419
La Onda has $ 1 5,000 for each of you,
so you can start things strong.

1813
02:39:25.586 --> 02:39:29.340
We're gonna spread La Onda gospel
Billy Graham style!

1814
02:39:37.146 --> 02:39:39.944
<i>El Mero Mero had a dream.</i>

1815
02:39:42.226 --> 02:39:45.298
We are that dream.

1816
02:39:45.466 --> 02:39:48.742
We're gonna multiply
in numbers undreamed of.

1817
02:39:48.906 --> 02:39:53.184
<i>In every pinta, barrio,
southwestern state...</i>

1818
02:39:54.426 --> 02:39:58.385
...La Onda has a destiny,
and no one can stop us.

1819
02:40:00.706 --> 02:40:02.662
<i>We are familia.</i>

1820
02:40:03.066 --> 02:40:07.457
<i>- Eso!
- We'll control it all.</i>

1821
02:40:23.786 --> 02:40:26.141
<i>What about me, carnal?</i>

1822
02:40:27.626 --> 02:40:31.619
<i>- Where do I go?
- You stay with me, carnal.</i>

1823
02:40:31.786 --> 02:40:36.462
You're the eyes behind my back.
The leg I don't have.

1824
02:40:36.626 --> 02:40:39.982
<i>The other half of mi corazón.</i>

1825
02:40:51.146 --> 02:40:54.582
You ordered me to destroy this mould.

1826
02:40:55.786 --> 02:40:59.904
But I kept it. For protection.

1827
02:41:00.066 --> 02:41:02.534
From you.

1828
02:41:04.146 --> 02:41:08.264
Now I want you to destroy it.

1829
02:41:24.106 --> 02:41:26.859
- I loved him.
- We both loved him.

1830
02:41:27.026 --> 02:41:30.223
But we did what we had to do.
For Onda.

1831
02:41:30.386 --> 02:41:33.184
You were right.

1832
02:42:01.626 --> 02:42:04.982
I give my life to you.

1833
02:42:10.066 --> 02:42:13.979
Win it all or lose everything.

1834
02:42:32.306 --> 02:42:36.015
<i>- What we doing here?
- No llores, vato. No más ven.</i>

1835
02:42:37.906 --> 02:42:42.502
You got me outta bed to come here?
You lost more than your hair.

1836
02:42:42.666 --> 02:42:45.464
Don't believe that shit about Samson.

1837
02:42:45.626 --> 02:42:48.698
I'm just stripping myself
down to the bone, homes.

1838
02:42:48.866 --> 02:42:53.064
- What if I said I wouldn't come?
- I knew you would.

1839
02:42:53.226 --> 02:42:57.424
<i>Watcha! Come look at yourself
in the mirror, ése.</i>

1840
02:43:01.986 --> 02:43:05.376
Oh, man. It's not all marked up.

1841
02:43:06.226 --> 02:43:08.421
That's a sign of respect.

1842
02:43:08.586 --> 02:43:12.625
For ten years I've been Star Trekking
in the Twilight Zone.

1843
02:43:12.786 --> 02:43:17.416
Thought if I looked at this
I might fiind my way back.

1844
02:43:17.586 --> 02:43:20.498
Damn, we were all innocent.

1845
02:43:20.666 --> 02:43:24.102
That's all gone, Crucito.
It ain't like that any more.

1846
02:43:24.266 --> 02:43:27.497
<i>Not even a little carnalismo left in there?</i>

1847
02:43:27.666 --> 02:43:30.863
Think you use brotherhood up
like a shot of tequila?

1848
02:43:31.026 --> 02:43:34.780
You just drink it down,
it makes you feel good?

1849
02:43:34.946 --> 02:43:37.335
The hangover lasts the rest of your life?

1850
02:43:37.506 --> 02:43:42.660
You showed me your mural.
You're a good artist. The best. Let's go.

1851
02:43:42.826 --> 02:43:46.455
Just 'cause you wear sunglasses,
don't mean you're blind.

1852
02:43:46.626 --> 02:43:51.336
You know what I see there?
A fantasy, man. A dream!

1853
02:43:51.506 --> 02:43:54.020
<i>Three vatos looking for something
that wasn't there.</i>

1854
02:43:54.186 --> 02:43:58.259
<i>Loco, we stood by
and trusted each other.</i>

1855
02:43:58.426 --> 02:44:01.975
<i>Órale, that's worth believing in.
We were familia.</i>

1856
02:44:02.146 --> 02:44:04.296
Never again, Crucito.

1857
02:44:04.466 --> 02:44:09.620
<i>Miklo and I are fiinished. He ain't
my family. I hate that fucking puto.</i>

1858
02:44:09.786 --> 02:44:11.856
Scrape him off the wall like dirt.

1859
02:44:12.026 --> 02:44:16.417
No matter how much hate there is,
you're still connected.

1860
02:44:16.586 --> 02:44:19.862
You got the same blood in your hearts.

1861
02:44:20.026 --> 02:44:24.417
That's a bond you can never break.
Neither can Miklo.

1862
02:44:24.586 --> 02:44:27.817
- He's just trying to be like you!
- That's bullshit!

1863
02:44:27.986 --> 02:44:31.581
<i>El Gallo Negro.
The baddest Chicano in the barrio!</i>

1864
02:44:31.746 --> 02:44:34.499
That ain't me no more!

1865
02:44:37.546 --> 02:44:40.185
<i>You ain't changed a bit, ése.</i>

1866
02:44:40.346 --> 02:44:46.979
What are you saying?
It's all my fault the way it all turned out?

1867
02:45:04.906 --> 02:45:11.175
<i>Órale. You think you got so much
fucking power, eh?</i>

1868
02:45:13.066 --> 02:45:16.376
<i>Control everybody's destiny? Chale.</i>

1869
02:45:18.546 --> 02:45:23.142
No, you're right. I set Miklo up.
I made him go after Spider.

1870
02:45:23.306 --> 02:45:27.458
<i>- I started the whole fucking thing.
- Relax, ése.</i>

1871
02:45:27.626 --> 02:45:32.302
Your back wouldn't be fucked up,
Miklo wouldn't be in prison...

1872
02:45:32.466 --> 02:45:36.300
- I forgive you.
- I don't want your forgiveness!

1873
02:45:38.106 --> 02:45:42.384
You. That's your problem.
You can't forgive yourself.

1874
02:45:44.986 --> 02:45:47.784
You need that guilt.
It keeps you going.

1875
02:45:47.946 --> 02:45:52.736
I know, bro, I fed mine
through a needle for ten years.

1876
02:45:55.026 --> 02:45:58.336
<i>And that güero up there,
hating his own white skin.</i>

1877
02:45:58.506 --> 02:46:02.260
Shit, he's got it worse than both of us.

1878
02:46:03.626 --> 02:46:09.337
<i>You gotta cut it loose, carnal.
It's fucking poison.</i>

1879
02:46:09.506 --> 02:46:11.462
That's who we are.

1880
02:46:11.626 --> 02:46:18.577
<i>Three vatos locos full of carnalismo
trying to survive in a fucking war zone.</i>

1881
02:46:18.746 --> 02:46:23.774
<i>But I know now that I need
my familia to do it. We all do.</i>

1882
02:46:26.026 --> 02:46:29.985
<i>Even you, pinchejura. Badass cop!</i>

1883
02:46:30.146 --> 02:46:32.182
<i>Hey, don't back away, vato!</i>

1884
02:46:32.346 --> 02:46:35.497
<i>Life's a risk, carnal, remember?
You said it yourself.</i>

1885
02:46:35.666 --> 02:46:38.817
<i>Pues órale.
Step into the ring and throw down.</i>

1886
02:46:38.986 --> 02:46:42.342
You a badass?
Take care of business, homes.

1887
02:46:42.506 --> 02:46:47.500
<i>Caiga, puto!
'Cause we're from East Los, ése.</i>

1888
02:46:48.466 --> 02:46:51.902
We come out chased by hounds.

1889
02:46:54.346 --> 02:46:58.544
Round and round we go,
wearing a rabbit's foot for luck,

1890
02:46:58.706 --> 02:47:01.743
just ahead of the fucking hounds!

1891
02:47:01.906 --> 02:47:06.900
<i>Qué vida, eh? Qué loca vida, homes!</i>

1892
02:47:11.706 --> 02:47:14.584
<i>Pero sabes qué, ése?</i>

1893
02:47:17.786 --> 02:47:21.779
We got something better
than a rabbit's foot, homes.

1894
02:47:21.946 --> 02:47:24.585
<i>We've got familia.</i>

1895
02:47:27.386 --> 02:47:30.344
<i>Raza, güey.</i>

1896
02:47:38.866 --> 02:47:43.064
<i>You know what I'm saying?
Te crees mucho, El Gallo Negro.</i>

1897
02:47:43.226 --> 02:47:47.014
You may be bad,
but you can't dance like Smooth Cruz.

1898
02:47:50.226 --> 02:47:53.616
<i>I remember you, vato.
El Gallo Negro, vato!</i>

1899
02:47:53.786 --> 02:47:56.141
I'm a lover not a fiighter, man.

1900
02:47:56.306 --> 02:47:59.343
<i>Sí, mon. El Merengue
at the Tender Trap, '72.</i>

1901
02:47:59.506 --> 02:48:02.942
<i>Rucas got their hearts broke.
And I kicked your ass.</i>

1902
02:48:03.106 --> 02:48:07.179
<i>I was breaking hearts and faces, vato.</i>

1903
02:48:07.346 --> 02:48:10.816
<i>You still can't dance, ése.</i>

1904
02:48:12.386 --> 02:48:17.460
But you can learn. I'll teach you.
'Cause it ain't ever over, homes. Ever!

1905
02:48:17.626 --> 02:48:20.140
<i>Bailamos hasta que
nos morimos, ése!</i>
