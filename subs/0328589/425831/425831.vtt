______________ . NVEE ______________

1
00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:16.432
Before I start signing these, I need
to thank somebody who's here tonight.

2
00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.352
When I had her at State...
Wait. That didn't sound right.

3
00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.605
I never had her.
Wanted her, but never had her.

4
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.150
What I meant to say
was when I took her class at State,

5
00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.737
I had the worst case of writer's block
in the world.

6
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:33.407
All I had were terrible ideas.
I hated them all.

7
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:35.451
I was just about to drop the class

8
00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:41.123
when she said something to me
that changed everything.

9
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.255
She said, "Terrible ideas
are like playground scapegoats,

10
00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.425
"given the right encouragement,
they grow up to be geniuses."

11
00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:55.471
She told me to take one
of my terrible ideas and work on it.

12
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.890
Well, I did.

13
00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:03.228
Frances Mayes,
who loves terrible ideas.

14
00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:07.024
- May I please French kiss you now?
- Yeah, go for it, William boy!

15
00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.609
Married, William. Sorry.

16
00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.991
-Proud of me?
-Ridiculously.

17
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.243
Frances, these are amazing.
What did you do to them?

18
00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:22.164
Chocolate is timing, my friend.
The rest is magic.

19
00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.582
Hey, Professor.

20
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.959
-I am so thirsty. Where's the wine?
-There.

21
00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:30.297
Tom is one lucky bastard.
A literary wife who makes brownies?

22
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:33.801
I swear, if you tell me you cook in the
nude, I'll go home and kill myself.

23
00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:35.928
Never in the nude. Always in a thong.

24
00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:37.596
Actually, if you knew Frances better,

25
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.973
you'd know these brownies
are a sign of avoidance.

26
00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.266
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

27
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.435
-How's the novel going?
-Not so well.

28
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.272
But the procrastination, of course,
is coming along fabulously.

29
00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.650
Then soon it will breed
abject self-loathing,

30
00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.693
and then I'll just become
a writing machine.

31
00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.320
-It's her process.
-What about Tom?

32
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.823
How's his book going?

33
00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.117
Fine. He's home writing right now.

34
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.786
-You know Tom?
-I met him recently.

35
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.663
Sort of by coincidence.

36
00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:06.542
The other coincidence
is that you reviewed a book of mine.

37
00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:10.170
I did? Did I like it?

38
00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:14.550
-You didn't.
-Well, I'm sorry.

39
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:18.762
I'm sure there were a lot
of other critics who loved it.

40
00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.807
And I really hope
you didn't take it personally.

41
00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:25.978
You called my lead character
"unrealistic."

42
00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.815
I think that bad reviews
should just be forgotten.

43
00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.400
Give him a brownie.

44
00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.277
And I would like
to give you this brownie.

45
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.486
It comes in peace.

46
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.407
You said you just couldn't
get interested in a novel

47
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.409
where the protagonist
was a middle-aged guy

48
00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:44.663
who spent all of his time
living out his horny teenaged fantasies.

49
00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:48.125
I just find that ironic.

50
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.878
Ironic? Why?

51
00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:54.506
Ask your husband.

52
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.770
What did he just say?

53
00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:29.333
Frances.

54
00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.460
Frances?

55
00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:37.549
I've got some unfortunate news for you.

56
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.136
I just got off the phone
with your husband's attorney

57
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:44.056
and they're going to...
They're going to pursue alimony.

58
00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:52.356
How can we be talking about alimony
when I hardly make enough money to...

59
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.150
But you...
You supported him during the marriage.

60
00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.279
Yes, but while he was researching
and writing his book.

61
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.657
I worked while he pretended to be.

62
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.992
Unfortunately,
this is just about the math.

63
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:08.747
-Well, he was having an affair.
-California's a no-fault state.

64
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.998
His attorney indicated

65
00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.709
that your husband would prefer
an alimony buyout.

66
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:15.921
Since you two were living
rather modestly,

67
00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.590
I don't think the numbers
should be too bad.

68
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.009
They're probably talking
about something like

69
00:04:22.553 --> 00:04:24.012
$200,000.

70
00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:28.016
-I don't have that kind of money.
-Unfortunately, you do.

71
00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.103
The house?

72
00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:34.356
Its value went through the roof
since you bought it.

73
00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.860
And renovated it,
with my mother's money.

74
00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:43.407
Well, it's all...
It's all community property now.

75
00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:50.038
So he gets half the house and alimony?

76
00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.498
Well, there's leeway in the numbers

77
00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:53.750
and we'll make
all the arguments we can.

78
00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:57.337
But there is a bargaining chip.
He wants the house.

79
00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.716
-He wants to keep living there?
-Yeah.

80
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.592
And if you let him have it, well,

81
00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:07.097
you could end up
with a lot of money in your pocket.

82
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.516
I understand he wants it pretty badly.

83
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:13.937
Sorry. This is so surreal. Um...

84
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:19.818
How... How would he even find
the money to buy me out of my half?

85
00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:23.989
Oh...

86
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.368
Oh. Wow.

87
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.663
Apparently she likes the place.

88
00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.207
It's near the right schools.

89
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.463
Schools. She's...

90
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.470
Wow.

91
00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:50.599
You're gonna get over this.

92
00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.976
You will, Frances.

93
00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:58.065
-Someday you're gonna be happy again.
-Mm.

94
00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:00.901
Right.

95
00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.237
-And the desk?
-The desk goes.

96
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.157
No. The desk can stay.

97
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.285
-The couch?
-Yes, please.

98
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.080
Vamos con la sofa, por favor,
y de aprisa.

99
00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:20.253
Wait a minute. No. The sofas can stay.

100
00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.838
No, esperate.
Esperese para alla, por favor.

101
00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:27.010
-How about the chairs?
-They stay, too.

102
00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:31.848
Actually, everything's going to stay
except...

103
00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:35.352
Except those boxes over there, those
three boxes with the books in them.

104
00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.648
If you don't mind.

105
00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:42.442
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

106
00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.153
The bedroom?

107
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.947
No.

108
00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:50.242
-Kitchen?
-No.

109
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.202
Levantense los cartones, por favor.

110
00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.124
So then we're done?

111
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:00.127
We're done.

112
00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:24.901
You gettin' a divorce?

113
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.362
It shows?

114
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:33.118
These are furnished short-term
apartments. That's all we get.

115
00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:36.163
Your neighbor in 2B, he's an attorney.

116
00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:39.416
His divorce has been draggin' on
for three years.

117
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.753
Nice guy. Gives free legal advice
to the other tenants.

118
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.927
If his crying gets on your nerves,
you just bang on the wall. He'll stop.

119
00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.220
Sorry.

120
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.141
The guy in the apartment above you
is a doctor.

121
00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:57.517
He hands out the sleeping pills.

122
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.395
-What do you do?
-I'm a writer.

123
00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:04.858
So you can help the others
with their suicide notes.

124
00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:07.903
Ah, you're one of those funny landlords.

125
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.405
Not really.

126
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.992
Well, here's your keys.

127
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.912
Have a good stay.

128
00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.915
Thanks.

129
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.678
Home.

130
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.941
Ta-da! You start a marriage
with cake and champagne,

131
00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.609
you should finish it that way, too.

132
00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:51.112
The beginning and the end
should be fun, fun, fun.

133
00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.448
Too bad about those pesky years
in the middle.

134
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.242
-Sorry.
-Make a wish.

135
00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.328
-Things got crazy at the hospital.
-Hi.

136
00:08:58.412 --> 00:09:02.374
-You made it in time for the toast.
-Bravo. And it only took a year.

137
00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.626
-To freedom.
-To freedom.

138
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.794
Thanks.

139
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.635
You're not drinking.
You're not drinking!

140
00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:19.015
-Fifth time was a charm.
-Oh, my God! Patti!

141
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.725
-When are you due?
-May.

142
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.061
May! Oh, my God.

143
00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:27.649
I'm going to be an auntie!
I'm going to be an auntie. Yes.

144
00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:34.239
-It changes our plans a little bit.
-Well, of course.

145
00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:37.450
We were about to take a 1 0-day tour
to romantic Tuscany,

146
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.537
but I don't want Patti flying
during her first trimester.

147
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:41.913
Small sacrifice.

148
00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:47.919
So we decided to change our coach
tickets into an upgraded ticket

149
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.004
for you.

150
00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:53.967
Oh...

151
00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:59.139
This is amazing. Really generous.
Thank you.

152
00:09:59.223 --> 00:10:01.349
But, no.

153
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:03.643
How can you say no to Tuscany?

154
00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:06.605
No. Like that.

155
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:10.483
-That's your depression speaking.
-Well, it doesn't speak Italian.

156
00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:13.778
It speaks a little high-school French.
Besides, I'm not depressed anymore.

157
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.115
Then what are you still doing living
at Camp Divorce with all those losers?

158
00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:20.076
-Be nice. Those are my people.
-That's not a place you live.

159
00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:22.245
Guys, come on.

160
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.789
Thank you so much.

161
00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.708
There is no way that I can go

162
00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.668
on a romantic tour of Tuscany
right now, okay?

163
00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:32.130
-I mean, I'm not ready to meet anyone.
-Oh, you won't. That we can assure you.

164
00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.214
Oh?

165
00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.844
-It's a gay tour of romantic Tuscany.
-Oh.

166
00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:40.680
So it would be very relaxing for you.

167
00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:44.934
Mostly couples, no one would be there
to hit on you or check you out,

168
00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:48.521
and you could just concentrate
and listen to your own inner voice.

169
00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:53.401
My inner voice.
My inner voice that would be saying,

170
00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.820
"What the fuck am I doing
on a gay tour of Tuscany?"

171
00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:59.074
Frances, it's Italy. Italy.

172
00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.701
Plus, you could use it
as a time to start writing.

173
00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.498
Well, I'm busy.
I have to review all those books, Patti.

174
00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:08.041
Instead of working on your own book.

175
00:11:09.418 --> 00:11:10.835
Wow.

176
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.421
Are you being mean, orjust hormonal?

177
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:18.510
Okay. Don't kill each other
until I get back.

178
00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:25.350
Can we please just talk about the baby?

179
00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:28.269
-I think you're in danger.
-Of?

180
00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:32.107
Of never recovering.

181
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:36.277
You know when you come across
one of those empty-shell people,

182
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:40.031
and you think,
"What the hell happened to you?"

183
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.326
Well, there came a time
in each one of those lives

184
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.203
where they were standing
at a crossroads.

185
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:48.289
Crossroads. God, that is so Oprah.

186
00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:52.252
Someplace where they had to decide
to turn left or right.

187
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.838
This is no time to be a chickenshit,
Frances.

188
00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:58.216
I'm not being a chickenshit, Patti.
I'm not.

189
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.176
Okay, just promise me
you'll think about it.

190
00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.805
I'll think about it. Okay?

191
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:09.102
I got a feelin' about you.
Are you lookin' for a place to stay?

192
00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:10.520
Yeah, I guess.

193
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:12.647
-You gettin' a divorce?
-What?

194
00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:16.401
We got short-term apartments, but
don't worry, some people stay for years.

195
00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:20.155
We got a writer, we got a doctor...

196
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:32.834
Hey!

197
00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:35.670
-Sorry. Sorry.
-It's okay.

198
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:40.175
-You wanna come over?
-No!

199
00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:45.847
Maybe later.

200
00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.480
"Maybe later." Oh...

201
00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:14.667
-Hello?
-Patti, when do I leave?

202
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.386
Hi, everybody, I'm David.
This is your driver, Edoardo.

203
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.555
And you are gay and away.

204
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:35.814
And welcome to your first day
of our romantic tour of Tuscany.

205
00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.524
Now, I saw most of you all hobnobbing

206
00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:39.567
and getting to know each other
on the plane,

207
00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:42.654
but I wanted to make extra sure
that you've all met Frances.

208
00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:44.405
Hey, Frances.

209
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.825
-Now, Frances is straight...
-Aw...

210
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.202
...and she just survived
a terrible divorce,

211
00:13:49.286 --> 00:13:52.413
and according to her friend Patti,
she really needs our support.

212
00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:57.252
So, Frances, why don't you stand up
and let everyone say hello?

213
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.879
Come on, Frances, come on.

214
00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:02.674
Hi.

215
00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:04.843
Screw the bastard, Frances!
Have some fun!

216
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:11.724
Okay, everyone, follow the flower.

217
00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:15.395
Good God, I can't believe it's raining!

218
00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:20.567
Sorry.

219
00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:35.039
You're empty.
You need a little more?

220
00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:37.542
You want more wine? More vino?

221
00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:40.587
Excuse me, can a black gal
get a drink up here?

222
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.714
Yes, she can.

223
00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.174
Frances, a little more?

224
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:49.804
Thank you.

225
00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:34.849
Buon giorno.

226
00:15:35.142 --> 00:15:37.185
-Uno buncho.
-Un grappolo?

227
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.868
-Sono tremila.
-What?

228
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:55.787
-Tremila.
-Tremila...

229
00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:04.087
Grazie. Buon giorno.

230
00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:37.578
Pretty awesome, isn't it?

231
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:43.584
Yes, I think you could say that.
Pretty awesome.

232
00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:46.713
God. How am I gonna
get through all of these?

233
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:49.757
I mean, how do you even begin
to describe all of this?

234
00:16:51.218 --> 00:16:53.845
Well, if you have a pen,
I could write it for you.

235
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.221
Are you a good writer?

236
00:16:57.391 --> 00:16:58.433
I used to be.

237
00:17:00.144 --> 00:17:02.812
All right, well, have a go.

238
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.942
-To my mom.
-Dear Mom.

239
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:13.072
Dear Mom,

240
00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:15.616
it's market day in Cortona.

241
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:20.663
The piazza is an ongoing party,
and everyone is invited.

242
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:26.544
Cliches converge at this navel
of the world, you almost want to laugh.

243
00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:28.463
But you can't help feeling that Italians

244
00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.882
Know more about having fun
than we do.

245
00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:33.885
I eat a hot grape from the market

246
00:17:33.969 --> 00:17:36.971
and the violet sweetness
breaKs open in my mouth.

247
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:39.348
It even smells purple.

248
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:40.767
I wish I could stay here longer,

249
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:43.186
but the bell of the campanile
reminds me of time.

250
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:48.316
"Ding-dang-dong," the bell says,
instead of "Ding-dong."

251
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.567
I wish you were here.

252
00:17:49.651 --> 00:17:50.860
Love...

253
00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:52.987
Rodney.

254
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.159
Thanks.

255
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.918
"Even smells like purple"? My mom will
never believe that I wrote this.

256
00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:10.129
Keep it.
"'Ding-dang-dong,' goes the bell"!

257
00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:13.633
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.362
"Bramasole."

259
00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:40.326
Bramasole. From "bramare,"
to yearn for, and "sole, " the sun.

260
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:45.623
It's a nice little villa.
Rather run-down, but redeemable.

261
00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:48.626
-Are you going to buy it?
-No! No, no, no.

262
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.629
I'm just a tourist. Here for the day.

263
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.214
So?

264
00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:56.676
Well, I mean, who wouldn't want
to buy a villa in Tuscany?

265
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.389
But the way my life has been going,

266
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.142
that'd be a terrible idea.

267
00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:05.351
Terrible idea.

268
00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:10.481
Don't you just love those?

269
00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:42.180
-Sorry, everybody. Unscheduled stop.
-Oh, my God, sheep.

270
00:19:45.517 --> 00:19:47.935
It's surreal, isn't it?

271
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.627
Stop the bus.

272
00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:15.588
-Stop the bus.
-What?

273
00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:55.169
--Hello?

274
00:20:57.881 --> 00:20:59.340
Hello?

275
00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:05.513
Shit.

276
00:21:26.576 --> 00:21:27.952
Oh, excuse me.

277
00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:31.330
-Oh, I'm sorry. Mi scusi...
-Can I help you, signora?

278
00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:35.710
Yes. I thought the house was for sale.
I didn't make an appointment.

279
00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:40.506
The house is for sale. But unfortunately
someone is already buying it.

280
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.218
We like it
very much and we'll buy it today.

281
00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:47.013
Very good. One moment, please.

282
00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.098
Excuse me.

283
00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:04.905
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

284
00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:09.744
I'm afraid there has been
a change in the price.

285
00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:12.079
It is now 20 million lire more expensive.

286
00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:15.166
Why? It didn't get more valuable
in the last five minutes.

287
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.668
The contessa feels
that she has asked too little,

288
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:19.003
since you have agreed to buy it.

289
00:22:19.087 --> 00:22:21.172
That logic is absurd!

290
00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:22.882
Excuse me?

291
00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:25.259
What is the price?

292
00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.471
Are you bidding against us?

293
00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:31.140
Wait. We accept the new price.

294
00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:43.194
The contessa says that since
there is so much interest in the house,

295
00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:45.363
the price is now double.

296
00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:48.407
- Since the last 1 0 seconds.
- Normale.

297
00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:53.454
You greedy Americans.
You think you are so entitled.

298
00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:57.500
-You ruin everything.
-A lot of us feel really badly about that.

299
00:23:09.763 --> 00:23:12.139
Is it really double the price?

300
00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:15.643
-Il prezzo e veramente il doppio?
-Si.

301
00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:18.646
I can't pay double the price.

302
00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:22.733
But please tell the contessa that

303
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:28.072
this is what I got from my house
recently, in dollars.

304
00:23:28.156 --> 00:23:29.990
Ha venduto la sua casa
per questa cifra.

305
00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:33.577
Minus the work on the place,

306
00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:37.706
hammers, buckets,

307
00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:41.001
men,

308
00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:43.003
chocolate.

309
00:23:45.006 --> 00:23:47.716
And a rental car to drive off a cliff

310
00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:50.761
when this turns out
to have been a terrible mistake.

311
00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:52.680
That's what I can pay.

312
00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:57.309
Signora, you've not even
seen the house.

313
00:24:01.106 --> 00:24:02.982
Well...

314
00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:07.695
Well, I...

315
00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:11.866
I can't go back to San Francisco.

316
00:24:14.077 --> 00:24:17.037
No.

317
00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:21.125
I'm sorry, signora. The contessa's
family have lived here for generations,

318
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:25.838
so understandably
it is very difficult for her to sell.

319
00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:28.966
Money is not the only issue.
She needs...

320
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.719
Un segno di Dio. Un segno.

321
00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:36.140
A sign. I understand.
I believe in signs, too.

322
00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:40.144
Well, thank you. Thank you.

323
00:24:40.228 --> 00:24:41.270
Prego.

324
00:24:47.527 --> 00:24:48.736
Oh...

325
00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:52.156
Please...

326
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.035
Grazie, Dio! ll segno, il segno!

327
00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:58.662
-What'd she say?
-San Francesco ti ringrazio.

328
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:01.999
In Italy, what happened to you just now
is a very good sign.

329
00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:03.334
-It is?
-Yes.

330
00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:09.423
First we open an account
for you. Then you transfer the money.

331
00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:12.676
Here is the legal description of the land,
two oxen, two days.

332
00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:14.053
-I'm sorry?
-It's old-fashioned.

333
00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:15.930
The legal description.

334
00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:20.184
The land is measured by how long
it would take two oxen to plow it.

335
00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:21.769
That makes sense.

336
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.402
Just like that?

337
00:25:30.737 --> 00:25:33.113
Before I've filled out all the forms
or the money's been transferred?

338
00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:37.535
It's a house, not a Vespa.
What are you going to do, steal it?

339
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.454
Besides, Signor Martini likes you.

340
00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:58.973
Okay. We'll take care of the rest later.
Normale.

341
00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:01.225
-Normale?
-Normale.

342
00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:02.601
Normale.

343
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.982
l have bought a house
in a foreign country.

344
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.987
A house and the land
it taKes two oxen two days to plow.

345
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:16.490
Not having a plow or an ox,
I'll have to taKe their word on that.

346
00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:20.744
Buyer's remorse is a very common
affliction among new homeowners.

347
00:26:20.829 --> 00:26:23.038
Just because
you have an acid stomach

348
00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:24.498
and a sudden urge to weep,

349
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.001
that doesn't mean
you've made a mistaKe.

350
00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:30.045
Everybody Knows old houses
have their quirks.

351
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.091
Especially 300-year-old houses.

352
00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:39.930
I have inherited
10,000 empty wine bottles,

353
00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:42.308
one grape,

354
00:26:43.059 --> 00:26:46.186
every issue of La Nazione
printed in 1958

355
00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:49.023
and assorted previous tenants.

356
00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:51.775
Urrh!

357
00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.444
Aarh!

358
00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:10.127
The tricK to overcoming buyer's
remorse is to have a plan.

359
00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:13.631
PicK one room and maKe it yours.

360
00:27:14.257 --> 00:27:16.467
Go slowly through the house.

361
00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:22.181
Be polite. Introduce yourself
so it can introduce itself to you.

362
00:27:25.435 --> 00:27:26.560
You did what?

363
00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:29.730
Frances bought a house in Tuscany!

364
00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:34.360
-And you're gonna live there? Alone?
-I'm not there alone, I'm there with bugs.

365
00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:36.028
-Eww!
-How's the belly?

366
00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:39.239
It's growing. It's good.
God, I can't believe you did this.

367
00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:44.244
-Did you already sign?
-Yes. Why?

368
00:27:45.413 --> 00:27:46.830
-Uh...
-What, you think I shouldn't have?

369
00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:50.334
-Are you telling me I made a mistaKe?
-I don't know. Did you?

370
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.670
Well, I don't know.
You're the one who made the

371
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:55.255
"empty-shell person
standing at the crossroads" speech.

372
00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:57.216
Oh, yeah, that was me.

373
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.345
Okay. Wow!
So you bought a villa in Tuscany.

374
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:04.473
-What's the place liKe?
-It needs a little work.

375
00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:06.183
Well, who's gonna do it?

376
00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:07.518
-I am.
-You are?

377
00:28:07.602 --> 00:28:11.105
-I never realized you were so handy.
-I can do things, you know.

378
00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:14.942
-Remember I fixed that drain.
-In your kitchen? No, that was me.

379
00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:17.152
I handed you the rubber thingy.

380
00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:20.030
The plunger? That was Tom.

381
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:23.784
I can't believe it.
Why, why did you just say his name?

382
00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:26.954
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I forgot. I'm sorry.

383
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:29.790
- I can make this work. You know?

384
00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:33.585
Of course I didn't mean I was gonna
do all the work myself. I'm in Italy.

385
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:37.005
I can hire the muscular descendants
of Roman gods to do the heavy lifting.

386
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.967
Yeah, right.
Just supervise, tell them what to do.

387
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:43.762
-So have you met him yet?
-Uh... Who?

388
00:28:43.847 --> 00:28:47.182
-The guy you're gonna meet.
-Patti, please.

389
00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:52.771
You know what, it's starting to rain here
a little bit, so I think I have to go now.

390
00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:53.897
Wait, Fran...

391
00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:55.399
I want you to kiss the belly
for me, okay?

392
00:28:55.608 --> 00:28:58.026
-Fran, I...
-Bye-bye.

393
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:02.531
-Can you star-69 Italy?
-No.

394
00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:04.366
I'm gonna try.

395
00:29:07.454 --> 00:29:08.495
Hello?

396
00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:13.667
Okay.

397
00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:26.930
One, one thousand... Two...

398
00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:28.307
--Arh!

399
00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:29.641
Jesus!

400
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:35.731
Okay...

401
00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:16.438
Stop it!

402
00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:22.236
Oh, my God.

403
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.738
Oh, my God!

404
00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:28.784
You're gonna be okay.
You're safe here.

405
00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:33.580
Just don't fly around, okay?
You'll freak me out.

406
00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:51.265
Signora?

407
00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:55.018
Signora Mayes?

408
00:30:55.728 --> 00:30:56.728
Buon giorno.

409
00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.734
I see you have survived the storm.

410
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:08.031
I'm alive. But the...
The washing machine is dead.

411
00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:10.993
Yes. It was electrocuted.

412
00:31:11.077 --> 00:31:13.120
I'm happy to see that you were not.

413
00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:18.709
You... You came to check on me?

414
00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:24.381
You are meeting the contractors today
and I came to help you.

415
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:27.718
-I believe one of them is already here.
-Here?

416
00:31:27.802 --> 00:31:29.803
Downstairs.

417
00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:36.018
Oh...

418
00:31:38.813 --> 00:31:39.897
He's here.

419
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:42.774
I was hoping to take this wall down,

420
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:46.320
turn these two small rooms
into one big room.

421
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:48.280
Oh, wonderful.

422
00:31:48.364 --> 00:31:52.910
You should have been an architect.
You have excellent taste.

423
00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.828
So, do you think it can be done?

424
00:31:55.622 --> 00:32:00.417
Heating pipes, a week.
The bathrooms, three days.

425
00:32:00.501 --> 00:32:03.503
Signora, give me the keys of this place

426
00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.882
and in one month I will give you back
the keys to your palace.

427
00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:08.842
Just...

428
00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:12.763
Just leave it to me.

429
00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:20.020
San Melchiorre dei carpentieri,
qui crolla tutto!

430
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:23.607
Boom, boom, boom!

431
00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:25.025
Oh...

432
00:32:30.698 --> 00:32:31.698
Andiamo.

433
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:42.542
Feci io questo lavoro. Era anni fa, eh...

434
00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:46.004
He says he fixed it himself
many years ago.

435
00:32:46.089 --> 00:32:50.050
Really? Oh.
You wanna see the rest of the house?

436
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.844
Okay. Yes, yes.

437
00:32:54.347 --> 00:32:57.516
Oh, ma non e possibile.
Eh, lo deve rifare questo muro.

438
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.685
He suggests that you rebuild the wall.

439
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:02.145
E importante per la struttura
del giardino.

440
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.898
It is important
for the structure of the garden.

441
00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:06.650
C'ho la squadra giusta, ora li chiamo.

442
00:33:06.734 --> 00:33:08.443
He has a team of experts.

443
00:33:16.869 --> 00:33:17.953
Buon giorno.

444
00:33:18.037 --> 00:33:22.833
Hello, miss. We are not Italian.
We are from Polonia.

445
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:25.585
Poland? Do you all speak English?

446
00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:28.380
Only me. And only a little.

447
00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:32.259
-I am Pawel.
-Pawel. Nice to meet you.

448
00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:35.679
Buon giorno.

449
00:33:35.763 --> 00:33:38.265
-Jerzy.
-Jerzy.

450
00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:42.060
Hello.

451
00:33:43.938 --> 00:33:46.440
-Zbignew.
-Zbignew.

452
00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:48.608
Frances.

453
00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:53.530
What do you think of Nino?

454
00:33:53.614 --> 00:33:57.409
I know his mother.
If he does a bad job, it's...

455
00:33:57.493 --> 00:33:59.119
Well, then...

456
00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:03.081
-Okay, yes.
-Okay, yes?

457
00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:04.624
Yes. Yes.

458
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:13.759
Okay. Yes.

459
00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.825
See, Frances? No problem.

460
00:34:43.372 --> 00:34:45.082
Nino?

461
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:46.458
Oh, God!

462
00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:49.711
Run!

463
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:17.030
Okay. Yes.

464
00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:35.215
Kurwa mac!

465
00:35:35.633 --> 00:35:38.760
"Kurwa mac" means
"holy shit" in Polish.

466
00:35:38.845 --> 00:35:40.137
I learned that that day.

467
00:35:41.097 --> 00:35:43.557
The fact that I'm trying
to speaK Polish in Italy

468
00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:46.768
is just one of the many surprises
around here.

469
00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.984
Is he a licensed electrician?

470
00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:56.778
No, he's a licensed literatura professor.

471
00:35:58.114 --> 00:35:59.114
Oh.

472
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:05.495
Czeslaw Milosz.

473
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:10.417
I like him, Czeslaw Milosz.

474
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.509
It is only natural that getting
to Know people should taKe some time.

475
00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:26.600
Every day I watch
for the old man with the flowers.

476
00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:32.314
And I wonder.

477
00:36:33.107 --> 00:36:34.733
Was he born here?

478
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:37.277
Did he love someone here?

479
00:36:38.654 --> 00:36:40.363
Did he lose someone here?

480
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:52.918
He doesn't seem as curious about me,
but that's all right.

481
00:36:53.586 --> 00:36:56.504
These days
I'm something of a loner myself.

482
00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:04.012
I'm pretty good at staying entertained.

483
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:06.431
Mostly, I liKe to hang out
at a little bar l know,

484
00:37:06.515 --> 00:37:09.142
conveniently located in my backyard.

485
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:14.606
Fortunately, there are some things
here you just can't do alone.

486
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:17.275
It's my neighbor Placido
who's teaching me about olives.

487
00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:20.987
Today is okay.
But never pick when is wet, eh?

488
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.575
These look good.

489
00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:31.289
Oh. Oh, my God.

490
00:37:31.374 --> 00:37:33.250
-Papa?
-Si?

491
00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:38.129
Okay.

492
00:37:55.356 --> 00:37:57.190
-Chiara?
-Si?

493
00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:01.695
Okay.

494
00:38:05.533 --> 00:38:06.866
Ciao.

495
00:38:13.374 --> 00:38:16.710
Si. Grazie.

496
00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:25.343
Francesca, are you busy tonight?

497
00:38:25.428 --> 00:38:26.720
No.

498
00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:29.472
Then come to dinner.
It's unhealthy to eat alone.

499
00:38:52.747 --> 00:38:55.081
-Is she okay?
-Of course. She's fine.

500
00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:09.346
Well, are we celebrating
something in particular tonight?

501
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.390
Gratitude to the saints
for saving us from droughts, mad dogs

502
00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:15.518
and glandular disorders.

503
00:39:18.314 --> 00:39:20.357
Katherine! A new hat.

504
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:22.359
You like it?

505
00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:26.446
I suppose it wasn't such
a terrible idea after all, buying the villa.

506
00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:30.575
Are you up there all alone,
no lord and master, no consort?

507
00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:32.285
No.

508
00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:35.789
-Do you have one?
-One? Hah!

509
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:44.172
I knew this would happen. Remember?

510
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.759
Don't blame me.
I told him not to get her that computer.

511
00:39:47.843 --> 00:39:52.055
She got an email lover.
You see? From Ecuador!

512
00:39:52.139 --> 00:39:55.600
Finally, she had to tell him her age,
and now...

513
00:40:07.446 --> 00:40:09.489
I'm so sorry.

514
00:40:14.328 --> 00:40:15.995
-Amore.
-Si.

515
00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:18.498
Terribile, eh?

516
00:40:18.707 --> 00:40:19.999
Si.

517
00:40:20.167 --> 00:40:21.376
-Nubile?
-Hm?

518
00:40:22.169 --> 00:40:24.712
Come si dice in inglese? Celibe?

519
00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:26.297
Celibe...

520
00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:29.676
Celibate? Celibate?

521
00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.639
No. I mean...

522
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:40.145
Well, actually, I have to admit
it has been a while.

523
00:40:41.647 --> 00:40:43.648
Celibe in Italian means single.

524
00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:46.067
He's not asking when you last had sex,

525
00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:47.569
he's asking whether
or not you're married.

526
00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:50.989
Thank you.

527
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.825
No, I'm not.

528
00:41:00.916 --> 00:41:01.958
He is.

529
00:41:06.422 --> 00:41:08.131
Oh, my God.

530
00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:09.799
I feel like such an idiot.

531
00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:13.845
Don't. Flirting's a ritual in Italy.
Just enjoy it.

532
00:41:13.929 --> 00:41:16.389
Taste this. It's gorgeous.

533
00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:18.433
Mm.

534
00:41:20.186 --> 00:41:22.061
-How do you do it?
-Do what?

535
00:41:22.897 --> 00:41:24.481
This.

536
00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:28.318
Well, hats make me happy.

537
00:41:28.402 --> 00:41:32.113
And ice cream.
Ice cream changed my fate.

538
00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:37.452
It was because of ice cream
that my beloved Fefe discovered me.

539
00:41:37.536 --> 00:41:38.745
Fefe?

540
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:41.080
-Il Maestro.
-Who?

541
00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.541
Federico, darling.

542
00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:45.168
Fellini?

543
00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:50.840
He discovered me in the Piazza Navona
with my parents, eating an ice cream.

544
00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:52.175
I was gobbling it down,

545
00:41:52.259 --> 00:41:55.512
letting it run all over my chin,
because I was very hungry.

546
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:57.722
"Do you like ice cream?" he asked me.

547
00:41:57.806 --> 00:42:01.559
I didn't know who he was. I was 1 6.

548
00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:05.772
"You are my imagination come to life,"
he told me.

549
00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:10.944
He wasn't just a great director,
he gave great advice.

550
00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:12.570
I'm listening.

551
00:42:13.405 --> 00:42:18.785
Fefe said you have to live spherically,
in many directions.

552
00:42:19.578 --> 00:42:24.707
Never lose your childish enthusiasm
and things will come your way.

553
00:42:31.257 --> 00:42:35.093
So now l was getting
posthumous advice from Il Maestro.

554
00:42:35.177 --> 00:42:37.303
And I tried to follow it by pulling ivy

555
00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:39.639
spherically
and with childish enthusiasm.

556
00:42:43.352 --> 00:42:44.978
Oh, my God.

557
00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.406
Niente qui.

558
00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:01.828
Niente. Not here.

559
00:43:08.627 --> 00:43:10.253
Could you look under the bed?

560
00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:19.095
Could you look under the pillow?

561
00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:27.895
No, it's a joke.

562
00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:36.821
Maybe he moved out already. Snakes
are famous for changing their minds.

563
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.705
What am I doing here all by myself?

564
00:43:46.498 --> 00:43:50.877
Don't you think it's strange?
Me, in this big house?

565
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.379
Excuse me.

566
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.883
I'm sorry.

567
00:44:04.016 --> 00:44:06.392
You are cold, Signora Mayes.

568
00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.146
Thank you.

569
00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:23.493
Do you know what the most surprising
thing about divorce is?

570
00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:26.496
It doesn't actually kill you.

571
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.583
Like a bullet to the heart
or a head-on car wreck.

572
00:44:31.418 --> 00:44:32.752
It should.

573
00:44:34.296 --> 00:44:38.675
When someone you've promised
to cherish till death do you part

574
00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:43.680
says, "I never loved you,"
it should kill you instantly.

575
00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:47.892
You shouldn't have to wake up
day after day after something like that,

576
00:44:47.976 --> 00:44:51.521
trying to understand
how in the world you didn't know.

577
00:44:51.772 --> 00:44:54.691
The light just never went on, you know.

578
00:44:54.775 --> 00:45:00.113
I must've known, of course,
but I was too scared to see the truth.

579
00:45:01.615 --> 00:45:04.158
And fearjust makes you so stupid.

580
00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:10.123
No, it's not stupid, Signora Mayes.
L'amore e cieco.

581
00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:13.960
Love is blind.
Yeah, we have that saying, too.

582
00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:17.755
Everybody has that saying,
because it's true everywhere.

583
00:45:19.925 --> 00:45:23.052
I don't wanna be blind anymore.

584
00:45:23.137 --> 00:45:24.303
This house has three bedrooms.

585
00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:26.139
What if there's never anyone
to sleep in them?

586
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:32.395
And the kitchen, what if there's never
anyone to cook for?

587
00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:36.482
I do, I wake up in the middle of the night
thinking "You idiot, you...

588
00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.234
"You're the stupidest woman
in the world,

589
00:45:38.318 --> 00:45:42.655
"you bought a house
for a life you don't even have."

590
00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:47.160
Why did you do it, then?

591
00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:53.708
Because I'm sick
of being afraid all the time

592
00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:56.085
and because I still want things.

593
00:45:56.837 --> 00:46:03.509
I want a wedding in this house
and I want a family in this house.

594
00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:12.602
Signora, between Austria and Italy

595
00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:16.731
there is a section of the Alps
called the Semmering.

596
00:46:16.815 --> 00:46:20.443
It is an impossibly steep,
very high part of the mountains.

597
00:46:20.527 --> 00:46:24.864
They built a train track over these Alps
to connect Vienna and Venice.

598
00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.616
They built these tracks

599
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:31.162
even before there was a train in
existence that could make the trip.

600
00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:36.959
They built it because they knew
someday the train would come.

601
00:46:59.274 --> 00:47:03.069
I think your snake
has gone for the evening.

602
00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:05.571
Yes, I think you're right.

603
00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:13.746
Signora,

604
00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:17.500
please, don't be so sad.

605
00:47:18.418 --> 00:47:22.588
If you continue like this,
I will be forced to make love to you.

606
00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:25.925
And I've never
been unfaithful to my wife.

607
00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:31.597
Yeah.

608
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:40.273
Buona notte, signora.

609
00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:44.443
Buona notte, Signor Martini.
E grazie per tutto.

610
00:47:45.612 --> 00:47:46.988
Prego.

611
00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:01.669
A train track through
the Alps before there was a train.

612
00:48:01.753 --> 00:48:03.963
Signor Martini wants me to have faith,

613
00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:05.298
something I've never been good at

614
00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:07.925
and now I'm even worse at
since last year.

615
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.721
Not that I don't want faith.
I'm jealous of the believers.

616
00:48:11.805 --> 00:48:13.723
But as a fallen-away Methodist,

617
00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:16.893
I do not expect to emerge
from all of this a Catholic.

618
00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:20.521
Although, I admit
some interiorjuggling is going on.

619
00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:23.316
To my surprise,
I have become friendly with Mary.

620
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.652
I thinK it started the night
she stood by me through the storm,

621
00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.821
knowing full well l'm not a Catholic.

622
00:48:29.823 --> 00:48:31.574
Yet somehow she seems more liKe

623
00:48:31.658 --> 00:48:34.577
Mary my favorite aunt
than Santa Maria.

624
00:48:35.871 --> 00:48:38.039
Aunt Mary is everywhere here,

625
00:48:38.123 --> 00:48:40.166
her calm presence assuring us

626
00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:44.378
that all things will go on
as they have before.

627
00:49:02.564 --> 00:49:04.815
-Buon Natale.
-Buon Natale.

628
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:09.153
This is my wife, Clara.
My son. My daughter, Stella.

629
00:49:09.237 --> 00:49:12.114
Stella. Buon Natale.

630
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.117
Bellissima.

631
00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:17.995
What a beautiful family. Wow.

632
00:49:18.413 --> 00:49:22.708
I thought I might see you,
so I have a small gift for you.

633
00:49:24.711 --> 00:49:27.630
It is San Lorenzo.
He is the patron saint of cooks.

634
00:49:27.714 --> 00:49:30.216
Apparently he was martyred on a grill

635
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:33.636
and seared until he said, "Oh, turn me
over, I'm done on this side."

636
00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.179
No!

637
00:49:35.263 --> 00:49:38.391
So now he is the favorite saint of chefs.

638
00:49:39.267 --> 00:49:42.937
I think if you pray to him, he will help
you find someone to cook for.

639
00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:47.400
Thank you, Signor Martini.

640
00:49:56.493 --> 00:50:00.329
-Merry Christmas, Signora Mayes.
-Buon Natale.

641
00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:03.082
Ciao.

642
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:21.142
Myprayers to San Lorenzo
were quicKly answered.

643
00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:25.855
I realized I already had
someone to cooK for.

644
00:50:25.939 --> 00:50:27.732
Plenty of someones.

645
00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:32.338
Bravo!

646
00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:37.218
Bravo! Bravo!

647
00:51:39.846 --> 00:51:45.810
Riusciro, riuscirai, riuscira, riusciremo,
riuscirete, riusciranno.

648
00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:48.854
-Good.
-See, Frances? Italian is easy.

649
00:52:15.715 --> 00:52:18.175
Have you talked to her yet?

650
00:52:20.428 --> 00:52:23.389
Si. I have talked to her.

651
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:27.017
Why don't you go sit next to her? Go on.

652
00:52:27.102 --> 00:52:28.561
Okay.

653
00:52:52.794 --> 00:52:54.753
Katherine?

654
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.966
Francesca! Come up.

655
00:52:59.092 --> 00:53:00.801
I'm having my portrait painted.

656
00:53:03.096 --> 00:53:04.388
Katherine?

657
00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:06.849
Come through. I'm in here.

658
00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:17.693
Oh...

659
00:53:21.948 --> 00:53:25.951
-I think I'll come back another time.
-Why? You don't bother me.

660
00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:29.121
Frances, this is Zeus.

661
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:31.999
He's an art student from Macedonia.

662
00:53:32.083 --> 00:53:34.501
He's staying with me
while he's studying the Tuscan light.

663
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.629
More vino, darling.

664
00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:46.805
He's not bad.

665
00:53:47.641 --> 00:53:49.975
He's not good, either.

666
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.606
Look, I'm going to go,
but I'll come back another time.

667
00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:58.108
Oh, you're so boring!

668
00:53:58.318 --> 00:54:00.486
-What?
-I said you're boring.

669
00:54:00.695 --> 00:54:03.989
Look at you. You're sad.

670
00:54:04.199 --> 00:54:05.908
Again!

671
00:54:05.992 --> 00:54:08.911
You're like a big black hole.

672
00:54:09.704 --> 00:54:11.247
Excuse me, but I...

673
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:15.417
Fefe always said,
"Regrets are a waste of time."

674
00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:17.753
"They're the past
crippling you in the present."

675
00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:21.423
I just... I just got here.
I just walked in the door.

676
00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:25.177
How are you ever going to be happy
if you keep wallowing?

677
00:54:26.179 --> 00:54:27.554
Listen.

678
00:54:28.306 --> 00:54:32.226
When I was a little girl, I used
to spend hours looking for ladybugs.

679
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:36.438
Finally, I'd just give up
and fall asleep in the grass.

680
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:40.401
When I woke up,
they were crawling all over me.

681
00:54:41.236 --> 00:54:42.236
So?

682
00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:46.365
So, go work on your house
and forget about it.

683
00:54:47.909 --> 00:54:49.660
I said go!

684
00:54:49.744 --> 00:54:51.453
I'm going!

685
00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:59.336
Work on the house
and forget about it.

686
00:55:00.672 --> 00:55:03.173
Gee, why hadn't l thought of that?

687
00:55:04.634 --> 00:55:07.511
There comes a time
in every remodeler's life

688
00:55:07.595 --> 00:55:10.347
when one just doesn't want
any more helpful advice.

689
00:55:10.432 --> 00:55:14.143
There comes a time when you no
longer want shaky guys staring at you,

690
00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:15.728
thinking God knows what,

691
00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:16.979
whispering things in Polish

692
00:55:17.063 --> 00:55:19.773
you're really, really glad
you don't understand.

693
00:55:19.899 --> 00:55:23.152
"Kocham ciebie," "Nie rozumiem..."

694
00:55:23.236 --> 00:55:24.987
I mean, there's only so much of that
you can taKe

695
00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:28.240
before there comes a time
when you reallyjust have to get out.

696
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:05.986
-Mamma mia!
-Signorina.

697
00:56:08.323 --> 00:56:09.448
Great.

698
00:56:12.118 --> 00:56:13.285
Hilarious.

699
00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:15.913
Bye.

700
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.136
You are American, eh?

701
00:56:31.596 --> 00:56:33.347
-English?
-Irish?

702
00:56:35.767 --> 00:56:38.060
There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

703
00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:41.105
You said you were gonna meet me.
I've been looking for you for 20 minutes.

704
00:56:41.189 --> 00:56:43.440
-What am I gonna do with you?
-Wait. Who are you?

705
00:56:43.525 --> 00:56:46.151
I'm sorry. Mi scusi, eh? Thank you.

706
00:56:46.986 --> 00:56:49.405
Wait. You just kissed me
and now you are going?

707
00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:51.949
Yes. I'm sorry.

708
00:56:54.452 --> 00:56:55.619
Okay.

709
00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:23.105
-You are too late.
-I'm sorry?

710
00:57:23.189 --> 00:57:24.857
I have already found somebody else.

711
00:57:28.194 --> 00:57:29.528
My loss.

712
00:57:31.364 --> 00:57:33.031
I was wondering if you'd help me.

713
00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:34.741
I'm trying to find an antique store

714
00:57:34.826 --> 00:57:37.786
that sells replacement parts
for a chandelier.

715
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:39.455
Chandelier...

716
00:57:39.539 --> 00:57:40.706
-Vetreria...
-Vetreria.

717
00:57:41.082 --> 00:57:43.250
Vetreria. Yes.

718
00:57:43.334 --> 00:57:45.919
Via della Chiesa Nuova.

719
00:57:46.004 --> 00:57:48.714
Si, Via della Chiesa Nuova. Si.

720
00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:50.215
-You know it?
-No.

721
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:55.262
But I know where there is another store.
My cousin owns one.

722
00:57:55.346 --> 00:57:58.432
-Your cousin owns a vetreria?
-Yes. Antiques.

723
00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:01.101
-Is it far?
-About three hours.

724
00:58:01.853 --> 00:58:05.189
-Two, if I drive fast.
-Two hours?

725
00:58:05.398 --> 00:58:11.069
Okay, one, if I drive
really, really, really fast.

726
00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:15.908
That's very nice, but thank you, no.

727
00:58:16.868 --> 00:58:21.788
I know. You think maybe
I'm just trying to pull you up.

728
00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:23.415
Pull me up?

729
00:58:24.417 --> 00:58:29.087
Pick me up. Pick me up.
Yes, there is that chance.

730
00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:33.509
But you are the one who grab me
and pretend I'm your husband.

731
00:58:33.593 --> 00:58:37.846
You are probably one of those crazy
American women like Charlie's Angels,

732
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:41.099
and maybe you are going to kung fu me
in the head and steal my car.

733
00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.227
But I'm willing to take the chance.

734
00:58:43.311 --> 00:58:44.686
You're willing.

735
00:58:46.814 --> 00:58:48.398
What is your name?

736
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:50.943
Marcello.

737
00:58:51.569 --> 00:58:52.736
Of course it is.

738
00:58:57.116 --> 00:58:59.117
Eh, va bbuo, a ssorate, va!

739
00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:01.078
Do traffic lights
mean anything around here?

740
00:59:01.496 --> 00:59:02.704
Sure.

741
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:04.998
-Green light, avanti, avanti.
-Avanti.

742
00:59:05.124 --> 00:59:06.708
Yellow light, decoration.

743
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.461
-And what about red lights?
-Just a suggestion.

744
00:59:45.623 --> 00:59:48.625
-He says he doesn't have it.
-Why am I not surprised?

745
01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:08.979
This is your bar.

746
01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.733
We are a family. I work here.

747
01:00:12.817 --> 01:00:17.613
And I sleep there,
above my cousin's antique store.

748
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.364
Damme no poco de limoncello, va.

749
01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.702
-Did you ever taste this?
-What is that?

750
01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:25.746
It's limoncello. We made this.

751
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:27.914
-You made it?
-Yeah.

752
01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:32.044
We take the lemon
and we take off the skin of the lemon,

753
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.504
and we put in the bottle

754
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:38.467
with three-quarter of alcohol
and one-quarter of sugar.

755
01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.010
Mm-hm.

756
01:00:41.262 --> 01:00:43.055
And, um...

757
01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:49.853
And you put the skin of the lemon
in the bottle and you leave it

758
01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:53.398
until it is the right color.

759
01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.234
And, um...

760
01:00:58.863 --> 01:01:00.030
And I forget the rest.

761
01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.532
But just try it.

762
01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.292
-Do you like it?
-I like it.

763
01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:21.134
My nephew.

764
01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.302
Yes.

765
01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.506
Hello.

766
01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:01.883
Well, hello!

767
01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.719
Hello.

768
01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:10.600
Ciao. Ciao, piccolino.

769
01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:15.647
Cosa? Veramente? No.

770
01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:17.649
What?

771
01:02:18.359 --> 01:02:22.487
-He says, "Take me home with you."
-He does, does he?

772
01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:23.989
Esattamente.

773
01:02:24.615 --> 01:02:26.825
Ciao, piccolo. Ciao, ciao.

774
01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:42.966
I run into you in the street in Rome
and... And now we're here and...

775
01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.760
Didn't you have some plans today?

776
01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:47.554
Didn't you have something
you had to do?

777
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.016
So what?

778
01:02:52.393 --> 01:02:56.646
If you smash into something good,

779
01:02:56.731 --> 01:03:00.192
you should hold on
until it's time to let go.

780
01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.361
And now's not the time?

781
01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:09.409
Not in my opinion, no.

782
01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.168
You have beautiful eyes, Francesca.

783
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.421
I wish I could swim inside them.

784
01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:28.637
What?

785
01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:34.935
No, it's just... That's exactly what
American women think Italian men say.

786
01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:36.645
I can't...

787
01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:41.441
Thank you.

788
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.783
Marcello, I'm sorry.

789
01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:51.368
I'm so sorry.

790
01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:56.414
I'm sorry. I...
I'm really nervous, you know?

791
01:03:57.416 --> 01:03:59.543
I was married for a long time,

792
01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:03.380
and since then
there hasn't been anybody.

793
01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:10.303
Would you like to help me change that?

794
01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.643
You are asking me to sleep with you?

795
01:04:17.603 --> 01:04:19.271
Yes.

796
01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:21.398
Hm.

797
01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:24.526
That is exactly the kind of thing

798
01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:26.778
we Italian men think
American women say.

799
01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:30.907
Yeah.

800
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:36.621
You honor me with your offer.

801
01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:24.920
-Francesca.
-Yes?

802
01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:31.259
I'm going to make love all over you.

803
01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:43.980
Okay.

804
01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:30.527
Mamma mia. Che bella spalla.

805
01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:33.196
-What is spalla?
-Shoulder.

806
01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:39.035
And what do you call this?

807
01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.829
La gola.

808
01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.414
-La gola.
-Mm-hm.

809
01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:45.250
And this?

810
01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:48.962
-Il capezzolo.
-Il capezzolo.

811
01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:53.174
And this?

812
01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:57.053
Esausto.

813
01:06:57.221 --> 01:06:59.806
-Exhausted?
-Exhausted.

814
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.101
At least, for the next five minutes.

815
01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:07.772
Okay. Okay.

816
01:07:10.651 --> 01:07:12.652
Me, too.

817
01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:17.782
It's terrible that you bought
a villa in Cortona.

818
01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:19.784
Why?

819
01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:25.498
Because it's not in Positano. And I am.

820
01:07:28.961 --> 01:07:32.047
You have to promise to come back here.

821
01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.216
Promise me.

822
01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:36.968
When?

823
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.180
Can you come this weekend?

824
01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:43.808
Well, I think so.

825
01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.520
-You think so?
-Mm.

826
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.316
You think so?

827
01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:01.326
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

828
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.995
Yes! Yes! Yes!

829
01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:07.290
Thank you. Thank you.

830
01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:11.086
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! Whoo!

831
01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:14.839
I've still got it. I've still got it.
I've still got it!

832
01:08:15.007 --> 01:08:17.008
Thank God!

833
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.594
Oh, yeah.

834
01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:34.567
Buon giorno.

835
01:08:34.985 --> 01:08:37.570
-Do I still look sad to you?
-No.

836
01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:42.033
Ladybugs, Katherine.
Lots and lots of ladybugs.

837
01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:44.911
Lovely. When do you see him again?

838
01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:46.871
Tomorrow.

839
01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.693
What... What...

840
01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.620
I would have told you I was coming,
but you would've talked me out of flying.

841
01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:33.751
-Look at you!
-God damn it, Frances.

842
01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.006
Hi.

843
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:40.884
-What?
-I gotta go pee!

844
01:09:42.928 --> 01:09:45.597
You must be so exhausted.

845
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:52.478
See this?
They tell me there's a baby in there.

846
01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:58.026
Big old baby. In there.

847
01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:00.570
Right now.

848
01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:03.656
I'm with you.

849
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.078
Oh, jeez...

850
01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.961
So, what's it like
having one of these in Cortona?

851
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:22.759
I hear the town midwife's pretty good.
She puts a knife under the bed.

852
01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:25.303
To cut the pain.

853
01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:28.223
Florence is an hour away.

854
01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:31.476
You're gonna be delivering this baby
in a hospital gown designed by Armani.

855
01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:57.293
She ran out on me.

856
01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:03.967
She said she realized
she didn't wanna be a mother after all.

857
01:11:13.185 --> 01:11:15.853
Oh, Jesus, Frances!

858
01:11:20.567 --> 01:11:22.694
How do you do it?

859
01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:29.033
How do you ever breathe again?

860
01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:38.793
Pretty soon.

861
01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.717
God, I missed you.

862
01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:50.972
Marcello...
I really think I'd better stay here.

863
01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:54.267
I'm sorry. How about next weekend?

864
01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:58.062
Okay, well,
how about the one after that?

865
01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:01.190
No, of course I understand.

866
01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:04.027
I won't forget you.

867
01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:07.447
I think a lot about you, too.

868
01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:12.201
Okay. Well, until then... Bye.

869
01:12:14.621 --> 01:12:19.083
There's something strange
about these trees. It's like they know.

870
01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:22.003
And they know
that we know that they know.

871
01:12:22.087 --> 01:12:25.381
They're creepy. Creepy Italian trees.

872
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.343
The baby's gonna like them 'cause
he's gonna be a creepy Italian baby

873
01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:30.970
who goes around saying,
"Ciao, Mamma, "

874
01:12:31.096 --> 01:12:33.639
and doing that backward
hand-wave thing.

875
01:12:36.643 --> 01:12:37.935
Life is strange.

876
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.279
-Where were you going when I arrived?
-Nowhere important.

877
01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.281
What's he like?

878
01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.075
He's a creepy Italian.

879
01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:54.494
-So go see him.
-I will.

880
01:12:54.578 --> 01:12:57.955
I wanna spend time
with my creepy American friend.

881
01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.166
I refuse to screw up your love life.

882
01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.753
Don't be ridiculous, Patti.
You are my love life.

883
01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.860
Frances?
Can you come up here, please?

884
01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:13.030
There's hot water in the toilet bowl.

885
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.453
Oh, my God. That's close to boiling.

886
01:14:19.496 --> 01:14:22.123
They must've
crossed a pipe somewhere.

887
01:14:22.207 --> 01:14:24.125
Oh, God, this is really bad, isn't it?

888
01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:28.379
Well, it's not good. Unless you wanna
give your ass a facial.

889
01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.132
That's a contradiction in terms.

890
01:14:31.216 --> 01:14:34.385
I guess it'd be more of an ass-cial.

891
01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:48.733
Oh...

892
01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:52.653
Okay, let's go.
Come, come, come, come.

893
01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:56.032
- I'm sorry, Frances!
- Sorry!

894
01:14:56.825 --> 01:14:59.076
We have nowhere else to go
to be together.

895
01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.828
What does that make me?

896
01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:04.081
St. Francesca,
patron saint of horny teenagers?

897
01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:08.336
Pawel, you were doing it in my bed!
I don't even do it in my bed!

898
01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.379
Please, Francesca, help us.

899
01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:13.216
My father don't let us see each other,
because he is not Italian.

900
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.344
Maybe it's because he thinks you're
young and you shouldn't be...

901
01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:18.346
It's because I am Polish.

902
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:20.765
It will be terrible if we are not together.

903
01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:22.475
Diventeremo pazzi l'uno senza l'altro.

904
01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:25.561
Pawel ha detto che
lui commettera qualcosa di terribile!

905
01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:28.356
Ha detto che diventera un assassino!

906
01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.025
Ho provato a parlagli ma non vuole
ascoltarmi e non vuole capire...

907
01:15:31.109 --> 01:15:33.611
Assassinate...
Did you say assassinate?

908
01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:36.030
Did she say that you were going
to assassinate somebody?

909
01:15:36.114 --> 01:15:38.824
No. She misunderstand.

910
01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:43.913
I didn't say... Amore,
I didn't say assassino.

911
01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:47.416
I said I'm going to "ask Nino."

912
01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:50.878
For money, to help us get married.

913
01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:53.548
"Ask Nino."

914
01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:56.509
I didn't understand.

915
01:15:57.302 --> 01:16:00.721
Married? You barely understand
what the other one is saying.

916
01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:04.892
We are in love.
And I go with him this weekend.

917
01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:09.063
To the flag-throwing festival.
I am going to throw the flag.

918
01:16:09.147 --> 01:16:11.148
Throw the flag? Why?

919
01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:16.320
Because I can do it as good
as any Italian man, that's why.

920
01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:18.239
And her father will see.

921
01:16:18.323 --> 01:16:20.575
Francesca? Francesca?

922
01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.118
My father!

923
01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:25.746
-Francesca.
-Placido, hi.

924
01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:30.501
My daughter says you are taking her
to the festa in Montepulciano.

925
01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:31.586
This is true?

926
01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:33.504
Just a moment, please.

927
01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:40.177
I told him you are taking me there
so he will stay home.

928
01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:44.181
-I don't want to lie to your father.
-Oh, come on, Frances. Who cares?

929
01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.726
Frances...

930
01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:51.814
If I am not with her,
I will die of a broken heart.

931
01:16:55.694 --> 01:16:57.820
You won't die.

932
01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.422
Isn't it great?

933
01:17:23.221 --> 01:17:24.388
There he is!

934
01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.731
-These are straight men.
-In tights.

935
01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:35.775
Twirling flags.

936
01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:38.527
-Fantastic.
-Yeah.

937
01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.534
This is it.

938
01:17:49.247 --> 01:17:50.748
He is fantastic!

939
01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:54.835
Fantastico!

940
01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:17.233
Whoo!

941
01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:41.757
Yay! Bravo!

942
01:18:45.762 --> 01:18:47.972
Pawel! I love you!

943
01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:00.985
Pawel! Scusi... Pawel!

944
01:19:01.778 --> 01:19:04.447
Easy... Easy, easy.

945
01:19:05.365 --> 01:19:06.365
Scusi.

946
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.040
-I threw the flag.
-Si, amore.

947
01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:20.838
They're fine.

948
01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.507
Let's go.

949
01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:28.220
What is it about love
that maKes us so stupid?

950
01:19:30.557 --> 01:19:34.101
Take the old man with the flowers.
Same deal every day.

951
01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.436
I mean, enough already.

952
01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.190
Why can't he just let it go
and get over it?

953
01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:54.163
Francesca, you see my daughter.
She seems so different.

954
01:19:54.247 --> 01:19:55.539
Really?

955
01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.958
-Chiara is not herself.
-Oh.

956
01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:01.545
Maybe... Do you know
what's bothering her?

957
01:20:02.714 --> 01:20:04.882
Placido, I don't know.

958
01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:09.386
Hey, Frances, look.
You can see Bramasole from here.

959
01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:11.263
See?

960
01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.140
Thank you.

961
01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.943
It's Marcello.

962
01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:25.653
Oh, my God!

963
01:20:29.407 --> 01:20:30.825
Wait a minute...

964
01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.536
What's he doing? Don't go!

965
01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:36.539
Where are you going? What are you...
Patti!

966
01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:39.583
Marcello! Marcello!

967
01:20:44.756 --> 01:20:53.305
Marcello!

968
01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:00.771
Arh...

969
01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:05.568
Wait!

970
01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:11.282
Marcello!

971
01:21:14.786 --> 01:21:18.080
We tried you on your cell,
but you were in a dead zone.

972
01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:21.166
I cannot believe that you let him leave.

973
01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:24.795
-He said he couldn't wait.
-Couldn't wait? Why couldn't he wait?

974
01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.215
He was on his way to Arezzo. He was
nearby and he thought he'd take a shot.

975
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.467
He was very disappointed, okay?

976
01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:33.053
-You've got a snail in your ear.
-Good.

977
01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:35.180
-Really?
-No! Get it out.

978
01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:37.099
He left you a note.

979
01:21:40.353 --> 01:21:42.229
Hold still.

980
01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:45.524
He's going north.
For a couple of weeks!

981
01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:54.074
My God. He had a dream about me
in a white dress.

982
01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:55.951
A white dress? Holy shit.

983
01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:58.954
Damn it, Patti,
why didn't you make him wait?

984
01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:01.582
I mean, come on,
you're a tough dyke, you know?

985
01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:04.168
You could've tied him to a chair,
you could've crippled him!

986
01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:07.171
You could've faked labor, at least!

987
01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:10.716
I wouldn't have had to fake it.

988
01:22:15.388 --> 01:22:18.098
Ten fingers, 1 0 toes.

989
01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:23.854
I commend you on a classic choice.

990
01:22:26.566 --> 01:22:29.485
-What's her name, Mom?
-Alexandra.

991
01:22:29.569 --> 01:22:31.820
Alessandra...

992
01:22:35.325 --> 01:22:38.410
ln ltalian,
the literal translation of "to give birth,"

993
01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:40.079
"dare alla luce"

994
01:22:40.163 --> 01:22:42.122
is "to give to the light."

995
01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:44.375
Alessandra...

996
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.170
Welcome to the light.

997
01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:55.552
Yes! Big day!

998
01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:59.306
Hello, sweetheart.

999
01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.934
Alessandra. Alessandra.

1000
01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:04.937
Okay...

1001
01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:09.400
You're so cute, you're so cute!

1002
01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:43.225
Frances?

1003
01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:47.855
We are finished.

1004
01:24:11.963 --> 01:24:13.505
Poland.

1005
01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:36.612
Dziekuje.

1006
01:25:06.559 --> 01:25:09.353
Come back soon. I'll cook for you.

1007
01:25:10.188 --> 01:25:13.607
-Pawel, you, too?
-Chiara is waiting.

1008
01:25:18.404 --> 01:25:19.696
Patti?

1009
01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:23.534
You wanna come with me to town?
We could bring the baby and...

1010
01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:00.297
I have to buy a white dress.

1011
01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:23.695
Grazie.

1012
01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:24.821
Prego, signorina.

1013
01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:42.422
Eccoci.

1014
01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:45.759
Grazie.

1015
01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:05.320
Marcello!

1016
01:28:07.865 --> 01:28:11.034
Francesca!
Wait there. I'm coming down.

1017
01:28:21.045 --> 01:28:22.462
Francesca.

1018
01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:26.383
Look how beautiful you are.

1019
01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:29.094
It's incredible to see you.

1020
01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:33.807
Every time we made plans,
it didn't happen.

1021
01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:36.059
So this time
I thought I'll just surprise you.

1022
01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:37.811
I am surprised.

1023
01:28:40.231 --> 01:28:42.149
What... What brings you to Positano?

1024
01:28:42.233 --> 01:28:44.818
What brings me to Positano!

1025
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.114
What brings me to Positano?

1026
01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:51.325
Marcello!

1027
01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:04.880
Wow, I...

1028
01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.051
I came at a bad time.

1029
01:29:09.135 --> 01:29:12.012
Francesca, wait. Wait. Wait.

1030
01:29:12.096 --> 01:29:15.098
I'm sorry you're hurt.
But what did you expect?

1031
01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.184
What did I expect?

1032
01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.354
You came to Bramasole.
You left that note.

1033
01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:23.565
-I thought... I thought that you...
-Just a minute, just a minute.

1034
01:29:23.649 --> 01:29:25.901
Months ago, we had a beautiful affair.

1035
01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:30.655
And if you think I wanted more of you
after that, you're right.

1036
01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.158
Because I did, of course.

1037
01:29:33.951 --> 01:29:36.453
You are a fantastic woman, Francesca.

1038
01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:39.081
But we were never able
to come together again,

1039
01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:40.916
even though we tried.

1040
01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.919
And this sort of thing
must come naturally.

1041
01:29:47.673 --> 01:29:51.802
I told you. There was my friend,
and she was going to have a baby...

1042
01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:54.513
There were many, many other things.

1043
01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:59.226
Important things you had to do.

1044
01:30:00.603 --> 01:30:02.646
And you couldn't wait.

1045
01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.357
Right?

1046
01:30:09.112 --> 01:30:12.447
Don't worry, Francesca. Don't worry.

1047
01:30:13.991 --> 01:30:16.368
There is nothing to regret.

1048
01:30:17.453 --> 01:30:19.663
Do you regret this?

1049
01:30:21.165 --> 01:30:22.541
No.

1050
01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:29.673
There is someone for you, Francesca.

1051
01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:43.437
Goodbye.

1052
01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:52.988
Francesca.

1053
01:31:30.526 --> 01:31:32.819
What's going on here?

1054
01:31:32.904 --> 01:31:37.073
She is Sylvia in La Dolce Vita.

1055
01:31:40.411 --> 01:31:41.912
She's very good, actually.

1056
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:51.713
-Is she drunk?
-I hope so.

1057
01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:03.600
You know, in La Dolce Vita
he goes in and he gets her.

1058
01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:09.022
Mastroianni. He goes in
and he fishes her out.

1059
01:32:43.182 --> 01:32:45.183
Katherine.

1060
01:33:00.032 --> 01:33:01.533
Thank you.

1061
01:33:06.747 --> 01:33:08.832
Do you think I make a good Sylvia?

1062
01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:11.126
You were wonderful.

1063
01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:16.673
Here.

1064
01:33:20.219 --> 01:33:23.054
I see Zeus has gone.

1065
01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:25.056
Back to Mount Olympus.

1066
01:33:25.349 --> 01:33:27.434
I'm so sorry.

1067
01:33:27.518 --> 01:33:30.020
Don't be. I'm fine now.

1068
01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:34.316
There's nothing like a fountain
and a magnum of French champagne

1069
01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.985
to put you right again.

1070
01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.738
Really?

1071
01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.200
What do you think?

1072
01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:52.375
Oh...

1073
01:34:05.097 --> 01:34:09.893
You know who I really love the most
from all the films?

1074
01:34:10.936 --> 01:34:12.395
Cabiria.

1075
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.775
You remember at the end,

1076
01:34:16.859 --> 01:34:20.987
when another man has left her
in the most terrible way,

1077
01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:24.032
and she thinks it's all over for her?

1078
01:34:25.576 --> 01:34:30.997
Then she sees some children
playing in the street, making music,

1079
01:34:32.249 --> 01:34:36.920
and before she knows it,
she's smiling again.

1080
01:34:40.257 --> 01:34:42.550
That's what Fefe always said,

1081
01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:46.596
"No matter what happens,

1082
01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:52.268
"always keep your childish innocence.

1083
01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:57.941
"It's the most important thing."

1084
01:35:17.294 --> 01:35:20.380
You're back? What happened?
How did it go with Marcello?

1085
01:35:20.464 --> 01:35:22.298
I don't wanna talk about it.

1086
01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:23.633
Chiara's here. She's upset.

1087
01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:27.387
She's out in the garden
talking with Pawel.

1088
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:29.931
I can't... I can't talk about it now.

1089
01:35:30.015 --> 01:35:31.474
Fran...

1090
01:35:49.952 --> 01:35:53.121
Stupid. Stupid.

1091
01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:56.666
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1092
01:35:58.753 --> 01:35:59.753
Stupid!

1093
01:36:01.672 --> 01:36:04.007
What more can I do?

1094
01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:46.508
Babbo?

1095
01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:03.399
I want to ask your permission
to marry your daughter.

1096
01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:04.609
Che cosa?

1097
01:37:05.694 --> 01:37:09.739
It's nice, but it's out of the question.

1098
01:37:10.241 --> 01:37:14.160
I have come here to ask your
permission to marry your daughter.

1099
01:37:14.245 --> 01:37:17.831
I will love her forever,
and I know that I will make her happy.

1100
01:37:17.915 --> 01:37:21.209
-All young men say this.
-Sometimes it's true.

1101
01:37:21.293 --> 01:37:22.377
Never.

1102
01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:24.629
Never? What about you two?

1103
01:37:24.713 --> 01:37:27.382
Don't be ridiculous.
I hate him half of the time.

1104
01:37:29.593 --> 01:37:30.969
Placido?

1105
01:37:32.096 --> 01:37:34.222
Don't you want Chiara
to be happy in love?

1106
01:37:34.306 --> 01:37:38.017
Happy, happy...
Happy is about a lot of things.

1107
01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:40.270
It's not just about young passion.

1108
01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:41.813
This doesn't last, Chiara.

1109
01:37:41.897 --> 01:37:45.692
And when it's over,
what you will have left is nothing.

1110
01:37:45.776 --> 01:37:47.652
He has nothing to offer you.

1111
01:37:47.736 --> 01:37:50.655
I have everything to offer her.

1112
01:37:51.949 --> 01:37:53.533
Everything.

1113
01:37:53.617 --> 01:37:56.578
Pawel, let's go.

1114
01:37:57.746 --> 01:37:58.746
Chiara!

1115
01:37:58.873 --> 01:38:00.290
Wait.

1116
01:38:03.419 --> 01:38:04.836
Won't you give your blessing?

1117
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:07.672
What if this is it?

1118
01:38:08.007 --> 01:38:12.552
The real thing. A love that lasts forever.

1119
01:38:12.636 --> 01:38:16.556
-What you describe is only in fairy tales.
-No, it's not.

1120
01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.393
And how do you know?
From personal experience?

1121
01:38:24.315 --> 01:38:27.859
No. I looked for it and I didn't find it.

1122
01:38:27.943 --> 01:38:30.236
But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

1123
01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:33.740
That's exactly what it means.
No one has had it.

1124
01:38:37.786 --> 01:38:38.786
Mamma!

1125
01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:44.792
Mamma, Mamma!

1126
01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.674
He has no family!

1127
01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:56.012
That's not true.

1128
01:39:00.976 --> 01:39:02.977
He has me.

1129
01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:11.152
I am his family.

1130
01:39:19.995 --> 01:39:23.790
O Signore,
santifica l'amore di questi sposi.

1131
01:39:23.874 --> 01:39:27.502
L'anello che porteranno
quale simbolo di fedelta

1132
01:39:27.586 --> 01:39:30.964
li richiami continuamente
al vicendevole amore.

1133
01:39:31.048 --> 01:39:34.008
Per Cristo nostro Signore.

1134
01:39:34.093 --> 01:39:40.598
Chiara, ricevi questo anello,
segno del mio amore e mia fedelta.

1135
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:46.729
Nel nome del Padre, e del Figlio,
e dello Spirito Santo.

1136
01:40:00.077 --> 01:40:04.956
Pawel, ricevi questo anello, simbolo
del mio amore e della mia fedelta.

1137
01:40:05.082 --> 01:40:09.293
Nel nome del Padre, del Figlio,
e dello Spirito Santo.

1138
01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:15.675
ll corpo di Cristo.

1139
01:40:15.759 --> 01:40:17.510
Amen.

1140
01:40:17.928 --> 01:40:19.137
ll corpo di Cristo.

1141
01:40:19.221 --> 01:40:20.304
Amen.

1142
01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.265
ll sangue di Cristo.

1143
01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:24.350
Amen.

1144
01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:30.023
ll sangue di Cristo.

1145
01:40:30.107 --> 01:40:31.566
Amen.

1146
01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.125
Okay, yes. Okay.

1147
01:40:57.843 --> 01:40:58.843
Grazie.

1148
01:41:08.145 --> 01:41:09.812
Mi raccomando, eh?

1149
01:41:10.689 --> 01:41:11.981
Mamma!

1150
01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.780
Bacio! Bacio! Bacio! Bacio!

1151
01:41:33.962 --> 01:41:35.922
What are you thinking?

1152
01:41:36.006 --> 01:41:38.925
-What do I think? Hm...
-Tell me.

1153
01:41:41.178 --> 01:41:43.930
I think you got your wish.

1154
01:41:44.014 --> 01:41:45.973
My wish?

1155
01:41:46.058 --> 01:41:48.309
That day we looked for your snake,

1156
01:41:48.393 --> 01:41:52.522
you said to me that you wanted
there to be a wedding here.

1157
01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:02.115
Yeah.

1158
01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:05.201
And you said you wanted
there to be a family here.

1159
01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:14.293
You're right.

1160
01:42:15.212 --> 01:42:17.463
I got my wish.

1161
01:42:18.507 --> 01:42:21.217
I got everything that I asked for.

1162
01:42:47.578 --> 01:42:54.417
Scusa... lo busco
escribiri Americani aqui... Tu sai?

1163
01:42:55.586 --> 01:42:58.171
You are looking for the American writer
who lives here.

1164
01:42:58.255 --> 01:42:59.589
And you've found her.

1165
01:43:01.758 --> 01:43:04.093
If you don't mind, I'll just...

1166
01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:10.266
There. It was crawling on you.

1167
01:43:11.226 --> 01:43:13.227
-A ladybug.
-Ha...

1168
01:43:18.817 --> 01:43:22.278
Do I, um... Do I know you?

1169
01:43:22.779 --> 01:43:26.449
Not really.
You reviewed one of my books once.

1170
01:43:26.533 --> 01:43:29.327
-Did I like it?
-Not very much.

1171
01:43:29.494 --> 01:43:31.037
No, no.

1172
01:43:31.121 --> 01:43:36.626
Don't worry. It was by far the very best
bad review I've ever received.

1173
01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:38.628
-You're kidding.
-I'm not.

1174
01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:41.672
It helped me get to my next book.

1175
01:43:42.424 --> 01:43:45.384
Anyway, I've been traveling
around Tuscany.

1176
01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:48.721
Someone said that you lived up here,
and...

1177
01:43:52.142 --> 01:43:54.644
-I'm Ed.
-Hi.

1178
01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.729
-Hi.
-Hi.

1179
01:43:57.272 --> 01:43:58.356
I'm Frances.

1180
01:43:59.524 --> 01:44:01.192
-Hi.
-Hi.

1181
01:44:02.194 --> 01:44:05.571
There's a wedding going on.
This isn't your wedding, though.

1182
01:44:05.656 --> 01:44:08.407
That would have been unfortunate.

1183
01:44:26.343 --> 01:44:27.885
They say they built
the train tracks

1184
01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:30.096
over the Alps
between Vienna and Venice

1185
01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:33.391
before there was a train
that could make the trip.

1186
01:44:33.475 --> 01:44:35.309
They built it anyway.

1187
01:44:35.394 --> 01:44:38.604
They knew one day
the train would come.

1188
01:44:40.232 --> 01:44:42.900
Any arbitrary turning along the way,

1189
01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:47.154
and l would be elsewhere,
I would be different.

1190
01:44:49.032 --> 01:44:53.327
What are four walls, anyway?
They are what they contain.

1191
01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:56.122
The house protects the dreamer.

1192
01:44:56.206 --> 01:45:00.710
Unthinkably good things can happen,
even late in the game.

1193
01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:03.087
It's such a surprise.
