1
00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:50.952
- Mommy's going to
the beauty parlor, darling.

2
00:00:51.036 --> 00:00:53.785
But I'm leaving you
with your favorite friend, Roger.

3
00:00:53.868 --> 00:00:56.698
He's going to take
very, very good care of you.

4
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.489
Because if he doesn't,
he's going back to the science lab.

5
00:01:00.572 --> 00:01:02.613
P-P-Please, don't worry.

6
00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:04.862
Whatever you say.
Yes, ma'am.

7
00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.651
Aye, aye, sir.
Okey do key.

8
00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:11.025
Why, I'll take care of him
like he was my own brother.

9
00:01:11.108 --> 00:01:15.066
Or my own sister. Ow!
Or my brother's sister.

10
00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.520
- Or my second cousin,
who is twice removed...
- Cookie!

11
00:01:18.604 --> 00:01:22.519
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times
removed from his place outside.

12
00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:26.851
Or like my fifteenth cousin, who is sixteen
times removed from his mother's side,

13
00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.850
Or like my twenty-second cousin,

14
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:32.513
- who is thirty-seven times
removed from his father's side,
- Cookie.

15
00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:34.513
Who is 11 times removed...

16
00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:40.178
...like my seventeenth cousin,
who is 156 times removed from any side!

17
00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:50.339
Aah!

18
00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:54.502
I'll save ya, Baby!

19
00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:56.710
Cookie.

20
00:01:56.793 --> 00:01:59.334
Don't burn yourself, Baby Herman! Whoa!

21
00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:02.625
Whoa! Ah! W-Whoa!

22
00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:06.914
Whoa! Wow!

23
00:02:06.997 --> 00:02:09.662
Whoa!

24
00:02:11.078 --> 00:02:13.619
Who turned out the lights?
Boy, it's dark in here.

25
00:02:13.702 --> 00:02:16.160
Don't they pay their electricity?

26
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.158
What happened? I'll find ya, Baby!
Where are you?

27
00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.990
- Cookie.
- Where am I?

28
00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:26.280
What's that smoke?

29
00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:37.273
Whoa!

30
00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:41.480
Whoa!

31
00:02:41.522 --> 00:02:43.687
Whoa!

32
00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:06.425
Cookie.

33
00:03:06.508 --> 00:03:09.299
Wah!

34
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.006
Cookie.

35
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.085
I'm here, Bab...
Aah!

36
00:03:35.327 --> 00:03:37.285
Wah!

37
00:03:42.824 --> 00:03:44.573
Cookie.

38
00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:50.946
Wah!

39
00:04:01.898 --> 00:04:03.814
Cookie. Ahh.

40
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.061
Cut!

41
00:04:10.144 --> 00:04:12.476
All right, that's the shot.

42
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.809
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

43
00:04:14.892 --> 00:04:18.222
What the hell was wrong with that take?
- Nothing with you, Baby Herman.

44
00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:20.596
You were great. You were perfect.
You were better than perfect.

45
00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:23.096
It's Roger.
He keeps blowing his lines!

46
00:04:23.178 --> 00:04:25.720
- Roger, what's this?
- A tweeting bird.

47
00:04:25.803 --> 00:04:27.760
A tweeting bird?

48
00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:29.759
Roger, read the script. Look what it says.

49
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:33.173
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked.
Rabbit sees stars".

50
00:04:33.257 --> 00:04:35.172
Not birds, stars!

51
00:04:35.256 --> 00:04:37.380
- Can we lose the playback, please?

52
00:04:37.463 --> 00:04:40.254
- Roger, you're killin' me. Killin' me.
- For cryin' out loud, Roger!

53
00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:43.002
How the hell many times
do we have to do this damn scene?

54
00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:45.459
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer!

55
00:04:45.543 --> 00:04:48.625
Takin' a nap! 'Scuse me, Toots.

56
00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:51.665
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess. Clean this set up.

57
00:04:51.748 --> 00:04:53.955
And get him outta there
or seal him up in it!

58
00:04:54.038 --> 00:04:56.121
- Lose the lights. And say lunch.
- Lunch!

59
00:04:56.204 --> 00:04:58.120
That's lunch. We're on a half.

60
00:04:58.203 --> 00:05:00.077
P-Please, Raoul, I can give you stars.

61
00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:02.743
Just drop the refrigerator
on my head one more time.

62
00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:04.867
Roger, I dropped it
on your head 23 times already.

63
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:06.907
I can take it.
Don't worry about me.

64
00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.406
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about the refrigerator.

65
00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:12.989
I can give you stars. Look!

66
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.403
Look. Look!

67
00:05:17.444 --> 00:05:20.025
Please, Raoul, I can do it, I swear.

68
00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:22.066
Just give me another chance.

69
00:05:22.108 --> 00:05:24.565
Toons.

70
00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:35.142
Mr. Maroon, Mr. Valiant's here to...

71
00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:38.141
He'll be right with you.

72
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.009
No, no, no! Wait until he gets to
his feet, then hit him with the boulder.

73
00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:54.925
Right, R.K.

74
00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:58.173
How much do you know about
show business, Mr. Valiant?

75
00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:01.838
Only there's no business like it,
no business I know.

76
00:06:01.922 --> 00:06:04.379
Yeah, and there's
no business more expensive.

77
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.669
I'm 25 grand over budget on
the latest Baby Herman cartoon.

78
00:06:07.752 --> 00:06:10.917
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.
He can't keep his mind on his work.

79
00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:14.082
- You know why?
- One too many refrigerators
dropped on his head?

80
00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:17.581
Nah, he's a toon.
You can drop anything you want
on his head, he'll shake it off.

81
00:06:17.664 --> 00:06:21.036
But break his heart, he goes
to pieces, just like you or me.

82
00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:23.035
Read that.

83
00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:28.617
"Seen Cooing over Calamari
with Not-So-New Sugar Daddy...

84
00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:32.114
Was Jessica Rabbit, Wife of
Maroon Cartoon Star Roger".

85
00:06:32.198 --> 00:06:34.113
What's this got to do with me?

86
00:06:34.197 --> 00:06:36.112
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.

87
00:06:36.196 --> 00:06:38.153
Look, I don't have time for this.

88
00:06:38.237 --> 00:06:42.192
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison,
but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.

89
00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:44.441
I want you to follow her.

90
00:06:44.525 --> 00:06:48.315
Get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.

91
00:06:48.398 --> 00:06:50.481
Forget it.
I don't work Toontown.

92
00:06:50.564 --> 00:06:54.686
- What's wrong with Toontown?
Every Joe loves Toontown.
- Then get Joe to do the job.

93
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.268
- 'Cause I ain't goin'.
- Whoa, fella.

94
00:06:57.352 --> 00:06:59.810
You don't want to go to Toontown,
you don't have to go to Toontown.

95
00:06:59.892 --> 00:07:03.099
Nobody said you had
to go to Toontown anyway.

96
00:07:03.183 --> 00:07:06.597
Have a seat, Valiant.

97
00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:09.846
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint
called the Ink and Paint Club.

98
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.844
Toon revue.
Strictly humans only, okay?

99
00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:17.218
So what do you think, Valiant?

100
00:07:18.758 --> 00:07:20.673
Well?

101
00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:28.295
The job's gonna cost ya a hundred bucks

102
00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:31.001
- plus expenses.
- A hundred bucks? That's ridiculous.

103
00:07:31.126 --> 00:07:34.625
- So's the job.
- All right, all right.

104
00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:37.749
You got your hundred bucks.
Have a drink, Eddie.

105
00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:40.039
Don't mind if I do.

106
00:07:40.122 --> 00:07:43.621
- Careful, Dave! Dave, you're gonna drop it,
- I got it,

107
00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:46.119
- I'm not gonna drop it!
- You're dropping it!

108
00:07:46.203 --> 00:07:49.159
- Watch it!
- Oh, no, the chairs are out!

109
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.816
Kinda jumpy, aren't ya, Valiant?

110
00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:09.274
- It's just Dumbo.
- I know who it is.

111
00:08:09.357 --> 00:08:12.273
I got him on loan from Disney...

112
00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:15.937
him and half the cast of Fantasia,

113
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:18.436
The best part is,

114
00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:21.809
they work for peanuts.

115
00:08:27.183 --> 00:08:30.347
Well, I don't work for peanuts.

116
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.429
Where's the other $50?

117
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:36.927
Let's call the other $50
a carrot to finish the job.

118
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.967
You been hangin' around rabbits too long.

119
00:08:46.048 --> 00:08:47.963
Hmph!

120
00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:02.956
## ["The Sorcerer's Apprentice" Dukas]

121
00:09:06.995 --> 00:09:09.578
W-Whoop! Whoop!

122
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:11.577
W-w-whoa!

123
00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:15.741
Oh, excuse me.

124
00:09:32.482 --> 00:09:35.273
Oh, oh, oh!

125
00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:47.058
Uh, taxi? Uh, cab?

126
00:09:47.142 --> 00:09:49.558
Hi, there.

127
00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:59.094
What do I look like, a bank?

128
00:10:06.923 --> 00:10:08.881
Wait for me!

129
00:10:08.922 --> 00:10:11.547
- Hey, guys, wait up!
- Come on, hurry up.

130
00:10:11.629 --> 00:10:13.546
- Come on, Sid!
- Hurry up,

131
00:10:13.628 --> 00:10:16.627
- Hey, mister, ain't ya got a car?
- Who needs a car in L.A.?

132
00:10:16.752 --> 00:10:19.126
We got the best public transportation
system in the world.

133
00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:24.541
Come on, Frank,
Keep the line tight,

134
00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:27.663
- It's goin'.
- All right, easy, easy.

135
00:10:42.281 --> 00:10:44.238
- So long, sir.
- See you later.

136
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.321
- So long, mister.
- Thanks for the cigarettes.

137
00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:48.320
- You bet.
- Any time.

138
00:10:57.898 --> 00:10:59.856
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Eddie. How's it goin'?

139
00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:03.396
- Okay. What you got for me?
- The usual bills.

140
00:11:03.438 --> 00:11:06.394
Hey, gimme back my ball.

141
00:11:19.263 --> 00:11:21.220
- Hi, Harry. You okay?
- Hi, Eddie.

142
00:11:30.048 --> 00:11:32.006
What's with Earl?

143
00:11:35.587 --> 00:11:37.503
Laid off?

144
00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:39.502
A new outfit bought the Red Car.

145
00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:41.501
Some big company called Cloverleaf.

146
00:11:41.584 --> 00:11:44.000
No kiddin'.
They bought the Red Car?

147
00:11:44.042 --> 00:11:47.998
Yeah. Put the poor guy on
two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.

148
00:11:51.996 --> 00:11:54.161
Oh, well, Earl.

149
00:11:54.245 --> 00:11:56.160
Here's to the pencil-pushers.

150
00:11:56.244 --> 00:11:58.701
May they all get lead poisoning, eh?

151
00:12:02.242 --> 00:12:06.030
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie.
You know what happens here on Friday?

152
00:12:06.114 --> 00:12:10.444
- Fish Special?
- My boss checks the books on Friday.

153
00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:13.443
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,

154
00:12:13.568 --> 00:12:16.193
- I'm gonna lose my job.
- Don't bust a button, Dolores.

155
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.191
You've only got one left.

156
00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:20.190
- Fifty bucks?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:20.232 --> 00:12:23.314
Where's the rest?

158
00:12:23.397 --> 00:12:26.146
Well, it's only a snoop job away.

159
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.187
Have you got that camera of yours?

160
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.185
- Mine's in the shop.
- Wouldn't be the pawn shop
by any chance, would it?

161
00:12:31.268 --> 00:12:34.891
Aw, come on, Dolores. You need
the other $50, I need the camera.

162
00:12:38.473 --> 00:12:40.389
Any film in there?

163
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.386
Should be.

164
00:12:44.469 --> 00:12:46.969
I haven't had that roll developed
since our trip to Catalina.

165
00:12:47.052 --> 00:12:49.009
That sure was a long time ago.

166
00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:51.800
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

167
00:12:51.841 --> 00:12:54.881
- We'll have to do that again sometime.
- Yeah, sure, Eddie.

168
00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:03.752
- Paper even good?
- Just check the scrawl.

169
00:13:03.835 --> 00:13:07.084
R.K. Maroon?
As in Maroon Cartoons?

170
00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:09.291
Maroon Cartoons?

171
00:13:09.374 --> 00:13:12.082
Hey, so who's your client,

172
00:13:12.165 --> 00:13:14.248
Mr. Detective to the Stars?

173
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.788
Chilly Willy?

174
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:18.953
Or Screwy Squirrel?

175
00:13:19.036 --> 00:13:22.118
- What do you want to drink?
- I'll take a beer, doll.

176
00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:25.616
So what happened, huh?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?

177
00:13:25.658 --> 00:13:27.615
Cut it out, Angelo.

178
00:13:27.657 --> 00:13:29.947
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I know.

179
00:13:29.988 --> 00:13:31.947
You're workin' for Little Bo Peep.

180
00:13:31.988 --> 00:13:35.945
She's lost her sheep, and
you're gonna help her find 'em. Eh?

181
00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:41.649
- Ow!
- Get this straight, meatball.

182
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.272
I... don't... work for toons.

183
00:13:51.645 --> 00:13:54.060
So what's his problem?

184
00:13:56.017 --> 00:13:58.266
- Toon killed his brother.
- What?

185
00:14:00.141 --> 00:14:03.472
Dropped a piano on his head.

186
00:14:14.592 --> 00:14:17.008
Got the password?

187
00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:19.006
"Walt sent me".

188
00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:36.498
- Nice monkey suit.
- Wiseass.

189
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:56.487
## [Hungarian Rhapsody No, 2, Liszt]

190
00:15:06.607 --> 00:15:08.898
Hey, look at that.

191
00:15:10.314 --> 00:15:12.313
Hey, cut it out!

192
00:15:12.438 --> 00:15:14.937
Does anybody understand
what this duck is saying?

193
00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:23.891
- Hmm, Most amusing,
- A little more wine?

194
00:15:23.932 --> 00:15:26.931
I've worked with a lot of wise-quackers,

195
00:15:26.973 --> 00:15:29.220
but you are despicable!

196
00:15:29.304 --> 00:15:31.344
Dog gone, stubborn little...

197
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.343
That did it!

198
00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:35.509
This is the last time
I work with someone with a..

199
00:15:35.593 --> 00:15:38.051
- speech impediment!
- Oh, yeah?

200
00:15:38.092 --> 00:15:42.297
This means war.

201
00:15:52.793 --> 00:15:55.541
- What, do you think that's funny?
- Oh, it's a panic.

202
00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:58.664
You won't think it's funny
when I stick that pen up your nose.

203
00:15:58.748 --> 00:16:01.872
Now calm down, son, will ya?
Look, the stain's gone.

204
00:16:01.913 --> 00:16:04.287
It's disappearing ink.
No hard feelings, I hope.

205
00:16:04.412 --> 00:16:06.869
- Look, I'm...
- I know who you are.

206
00:16:06.994 --> 00:16:10.242
Marvin Acme, the guy
that owns Toontown. The Gag King.

207
00:16:10.284 --> 00:16:13.574
"If it's Acme, it's a gasser".
Put it there, pal.

208
00:16:15.656 --> 00:16:20.069
The hand buzzer.
Still our biggest seller.

209
00:16:26.651 --> 00:16:29.149
Scotch on the rocks.

210
00:16:29.274 --> 00:16:31.732
And I mean ice!

211
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.477
This is hot stuff.

212
00:16:43.642 --> 00:16:47.974
- Yeah!

213
00:17:01.717 --> 00:17:04.757
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

214
00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:18.416
Hey, those ducks are funny.

215
00:17:18.499 --> 00:17:21.456
They-They never get to finish the act.

216
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.038
- Great. Thanks.
- Rocks.

217
00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:30.827
- Toons.
- Cigars? Cigarettes?

218
00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:35.241
- Eddie Valiant!
- Betty?

219
00:17:35.366 --> 00:17:37.699
Long time no see.

220
00:17:37.782 --> 00:17:42.696
- What are you doing here?
- Work's been kinda slow
since cartoons went to color

221
00:17:42.821 --> 00:17:46.610
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop boop be-doop, boop!

222
00:17:46.694 --> 00:17:50.818
Yeah. You still got it.

223
00:17:57.397 --> 00:18:01.978
- What's with him?
- Mr. Acme never misses
a night when Jessica performs.

224
00:18:02.061 --> 00:18:04.018
Got a thing for rabbits, huh?

225
00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.095
# You had plenty money #

226
00:18:17.178 --> 00:18:20.385
# In 1922 #

227
00:18:20.468 --> 00:18:22.384
# You let #

228
00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:25.550
# Other women make a #

229
00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:27.632
# Fool of you #

230
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:31.255
# Why don't ya do right #

231
00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:37.085
# Like some other men #

232
00:18:37.168 --> 00:18:39.126

# Get outta here #

234
00:18:47.372 --> 00:18:51.286
- She's married to Roger Rabbit?
- # Get me some money#

235
00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:55.826
- # Too #
- Yeah. What a lucky girl.

236
00:18:58.324 --> 00:19:01.365
# Now, if you had prepared #

237
00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:05.445
# Twenty years ago #

238
00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:09.152
# You wouldn't be wanderin' now #

239
00:19:09.236 --> 00:19:11.652
# From door to door #

240
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:17.689
# Why don't ya do right #

241
00:19:17.814 --> 00:19:20.979

# Get outta here #

# Do ##

250
00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:44.146
Who is it?

251
00:20:44.271 --> 00:20:47.686
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.

252
00:20:49.102 --> 00:20:51.935
You sure murdered 'em
again tonight, baby.

253
00:20:52.018 --> 00:20:55.932
I really mean it,
My darling, you were superb.

254
00:20:55.973 --> 00:20:58.764
You absolutely, truly and honestly

255
00:20:58.847 --> 00:21:01.096
fashmolyed that audience.

256
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.596
You killed them, You slayed them,

257
00:21:03.678 --> 00:21:06.635
You belted them, You were terrific,

258
00:21:08.926 --> 00:21:11.217
What do you think you're doing, chump?

259
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.466
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?

260
00:21:18.171 --> 00:21:20.711
Aah!

261
00:21:20.836 --> 00:21:25.751
And don't let me catch your peepin' face
around here again, got it?

262
00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:29.623
Ooga-booga!

263
00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:51.405
Come, my dear Jessica, Come over here,

264
00:21:51.489 --> 00:21:55.028
I've got everything arranged
right here on the bed.

265
00:21:55.153 --> 00:21:58.901
Oh, not tonight, Marvin,
I have a headache.

266
00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:01.983
But Jessica, you promised.

267
00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:04.065
Oh, all right.

268
00:22:04.107 --> 00:22:07.105
But this time, take off that handbuzzer.

269
00:22:09.729 --> 00:22:12.145
Patty-cake

270
00:22:12.228 --> 00:22:15.684
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake,
- Oh, Marvin,

271
00:22:15.726 --> 00:22:17.682
- Patty-cake,
- Marvin!

272
00:22:17.724 --> 00:22:21.514
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake,
- Marvin, Oh!

273
00:22:21.556 --> 00:22:23.555
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- Oh, Marvin!

274
00:22:23.597 --> 00:22:25.554
- Patty-cake, Patty-cake, Patty-cake!
- Oh, no, Marv...

275
00:22:25.596 --> 00:22:27.553
- Patty-cake! Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
- You gotta be kiddin' me.

276
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.427
Patty-cake, patty-cake?

277
00:22:30.509 --> 00:22:33.508
I don't believe it!

278
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:38.382
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

279
00:22:38.465 --> 00:22:40.838
Is that true?

280
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.836
Take comfort, son. You're not the first
man whose wife played patty-cake on him.

281
00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:54.373
I just don't believe it.

282
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:57.330
I won't believe it.
I can't believe it.

283
00:22:57.372 --> 00:22:59.329
I shan't believe it.

284
00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:02.203
Believe it, kid.
I took the pictures myself.

285
00:23:02.245 --> 00:23:04.784
- She played patty-cake.
- No!

286
00:23:04.868 --> 00:23:07.824
Not my Jessica.
Not patty-cake!

287
00:23:07.907 --> 00:23:10.365
This is impossible.
I don't believe it.

288
00:23:10.407 --> 00:23:12.489
It can't be.
It can't be!

289
00:23:12.572 --> 00:23:16.363
Jessica's my wife.
It's absolutely impossible!

290
00:23:16.404 --> 00:23:18.736
Jessica's the light of my life.

291
00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:21.818
The apple of my eye.
The cream in my coffee.

292
00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:25.108
You better start drinkin' it black,
'cause Acme's takin' the cream now.

293
00:23:25.191 --> 00:23:29.148
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been
my friend and neighbor for 30 years.

294
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:31.188
Who would've thought he was a sugar daddy?

295
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.895
Somebody must a made her do it.

296
00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:37.019
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.

297
00:23:44.015 --> 00:23:46.471
Aah!

298
00:23:52.469 --> 00:23:55.758
Aah!

299
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:11.252
Thanks. I needed that.

300
00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:18.081
Son of a bitch.

301
00:24:18.164 --> 00:24:20.080
Look, Mr. Maroon.

302
00:24:20.163 --> 00:24:23.121
I think my work here is finished.

303
00:24:23.204 --> 00:24:26.619
How 'bout that carrot you owe me, huh?

304
00:24:26.661 --> 00:24:29.118
- A deal's a deal.
- Great.

305
00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:32.407
Thanks. Phew.

306
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.406
Roger,

307
00:24:34.489 --> 00:24:37.072
I know all this seems pretty painful now.

308
00:24:37.155 --> 00:24:39.404
But you'll find someone new.

309
00:24:39.487 --> 00:24:42.069
- Won't he, Mr. Valiant?
- Yeah, sure.

310
00:24:42.152 --> 00:24:44.859
A good-looking guy like that?

311
00:24:44.943 --> 00:24:48.067
- The dames will be breakin' his door down.
- Dames? What dames?

312
00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.233
Jessica's the only one for me.
You'll see!

313
00:24:50.315 --> 00:24:52.232
We'll rise above this piddling peccadillo.

314
00:24:52.314 --> 00:24:56.645
We're gonna be happy again. Got that?
Happy. Capital H-A-P-P-I.

315
00:25:03.767 --> 00:25:06.682
Well, at least he took it well.

316
00:25:15.553 --> 00:25:17.467
Oh, Jessica.

317
00:25:17.551 --> 00:25:21.299
Please tell me it's not true.

318
00:25:25.589 --> 00:25:27.505
P-P-Please.

319
00:27:47.393 --> 00:27:50.100
Oh, Lieutenant Santino.

320
00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.723
Where'd you come from?

321
00:27:54.765 --> 00:27:58.346
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money
so bad, why didn't you come to me?

322
00:27:58.429 --> 00:28:01.720
So I took a couple
of dirty pictures. So kill me.

323
00:28:01.762 --> 00:28:04.927
- I already got a stiff
on my hands, thank you.
- Huh?

324
00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:07.633
Marvin Acme.

325
00:28:07.716 --> 00:28:11.715
- The rabbit kacked him last night.
- What?

326
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.625
Now what?

327
00:28:24.708 --> 00:28:27.874
It's just I haven't been
this close to Toontown for a while.

328
00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:32.162
Yeeow!

329
00:28:32.245 --> 00:28:34.494
Oof, oof, oof! Ow!

330
00:28:34.536 --> 00:28:37.368
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch! Ow! Ooh!

331
00:28:37.452 --> 00:28:39.992
Eee! Great horny toads, that smarts!

332
00:28:45.823 --> 00:28:48.863
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.

333
00:28:52.985 --> 00:28:54.901
He's with me.

334
00:29:00.523 --> 00:29:03.480
- I didn't see anything, I mean,
the worst of it...
- Come on, Lieutenant,

335
00:29:03.522 --> 00:29:07.644
Just like a toon to drop a safe
on a guy's head.

336
00:29:07.686 --> 00:29:12.059
Sorry, Eddie.
You better wait here, all right?

337
00:29:12.143 --> 00:29:14.392
You got a positive ID, on the victim?

338
00:29:25.052 --> 00:29:27.552
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.

339
00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:30.717
You seen one of these?

340
00:29:33.922 --> 00:29:37.046
Hey, guys!

341
00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:51.039
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?

342
00:29:51.165 --> 00:29:55.329
Or did you change your name
to Jack Daniels?

343
00:30:01.618 --> 00:30:05.115
- What's that?
- Paint from the rabbit's glove.

344
00:30:05.198 --> 00:30:07.157
Mr. Valiant?

345
00:30:10.739 --> 00:30:15.486
I hope you're proud of yourself
and those pictures you took!

346
00:30:22.566 --> 00:30:24.440
- Oh, for cryin' out loud, Mike,

347
00:30:24.481 --> 00:30:27.938
Hey, we need some help over here!
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!

348
00:30:30.603 --> 00:30:33.394
Oh, oh! Oh,

349
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.136
Ow.

350
00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.588
Is this man removing evidence
from the scene of a crime?

351
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:04.129
Uh, no, Judge Doom. Uh, Valiant here
was just pickin' it up for ya.

352
00:31:04.253 --> 00:31:06.168
Weren't ya, Eddie?

353
00:31:06.252 --> 00:31:09.042
- Hand it over.
- Sure.

354
00:31:12.332 --> 00:31:14.582
His number-one seller.

355
00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:18.829
I see working for a toon
has rubbed off on you.

356
00:31:18.912 --> 00:31:24.784
- I wasn't workin' for a toon.
I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
- Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.

357
00:31:24.867 --> 00:31:29.198
He told us the rabbit became quite agitated
when you showed him the pictures.

358
00:31:29.282 --> 00:31:33.406
The rabbit said, one way or another,
he and his wife are going to be happy.

359
00:31:33.447 --> 00:31:35.405
Is that true?

360
00:31:35.446 --> 00:31:37.736
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

361
00:31:37.778 --> 00:31:39.735
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's a judge.

362
00:31:39.777 --> 00:31:41.733
That's all right, Lieutenant.

363
00:31:41.775 --> 00:31:45.108
From the smell of him,
I'd say it was the booze talking.

364
00:31:45.233 --> 00:31:47.815
No matter.
The rabbit won't get far.

365
00:31:47.898 --> 00:31:49.939
My men will find him.

366
00:31:57.435 --> 00:32:00.600
- Weasels?
- Yes. I find they have
a special gift for the work.

367
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:03.682
All right, ya mugs.
Fall out.

368
00:32:03.765 --> 00:32:05.680
Did you find the rabbit?

369
00:32:05.763 --> 00:32:09.762
Don't worry, Judge.
We got "deformants" all over the city.

370
00:32:09.844 --> 00:32:12.095
We'll find 'im.

371
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.133
You wouldn't have any idea where
the rabbit might be, Mr. Valiant?

372
00:32:17.258 --> 00:32:20.215
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?

373
00:32:20.257 --> 00:32:23.339
I hear Kokomo's very nice
this time of the year.

374
00:32:23.422 --> 00:32:26.171
I'm surprised you're not
more cooperative, Mr. Valiant.

375
00:32:26.255 --> 00:32:30.210
A human has been murdered by a toon.
Don't you appreciate the magnitude of that?

376
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:38.956
Since I've had Toontown
under my jurisdiction,

377
00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:42.496
my goal has been to reign in the insanity.

378
00:32:42.578 --> 00:32:46.285
And the only way to do that
is to make toons respect...

379
00:32:46.369 --> 00:32:48.284
- the law.

380
00:33:00.196 --> 00:33:03.194
How did that gargoyle get to be a judge?

381
00:33:03.277 --> 00:33:06.691
Spread a bunch of simoleons
around Toontown a couple of years back.

382
00:33:06.733 --> 00:33:09.856
- Bought the election.
- Yeah? What's that?

383
00:33:13.022 --> 00:33:15.396
Remember how they always thought
there wasn't a way to kill a toon?

384
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.394
- Yeah,
- Well, Doom found a way,

385
00:33:17.478 --> 00:33:21.060
Turpentine, acetone, benzene,
He calls it "The Dip".

386
00:33:21.185 --> 00:33:23.351
I'll catch the rabbit, Mr, Valiant,

387
00:33:23.392 --> 00:33:26.350
And I'll try him, convict him...

388
00:33:26.391 --> 00:33:29.013
and execute him.

389
00:33:37.469 --> 00:33:40.050
Geez!

390
00:33:45.131 --> 00:33:49.504
That's one dead shoe, eh, Boss?

391
00:33:49.545 --> 00:33:52.377
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.

392
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.708
This is how we handle things
down in Toontown.

393
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.707
I'd think you, of all people,
would appreciate that.

394
00:34:09.244 --> 00:34:11.493
#La, la, la, la, la, la, la#

395
00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:20.238
Uh... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!

396
00:34:20.322 --> 00:34:22.737
#La, la, la, la, la, la, la##

397
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.027
I've been tryin' to make him quit,
but he just won't listen to me.

398
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.275
What do you know, ya dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. Of a rattle.

399
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:31.440
- You Valiant?
- Yeah.

400
00:34:31.523 --> 00:34:34.397
I want to talk to you
about the Acme murder. Hey, psst.

401
00:34:34.481 --> 00:34:37.605
Doll, why don't you run downstairs
and get me a racin' form?

402
00:34:37.688 --> 00:34:40.977
Ooh! Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

403
00:34:42.061 --> 00:34:44.018
A ladies' man, huh?

404
00:34:44.101 --> 00:34:46.892
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust
and a three-year-old dinky.

405
00:34:46.975 --> 00:34:51.015
- Yeah. Must be tough.
- Look, Valiant, the rabbit didn't kill Acme.

406
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.512
He's not a murderer, I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine,

407
00:34:54.554 --> 00:34:58.136
I tell you, Valiant, the whole thing
stinks like yesterday's diapers.

408
00:34:58.219 --> 00:35:01.676
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.

409
00:35:01.718 --> 00:35:05.174
That's a load of succotash.
Every toon knows Acme had a will.

410
00:35:05.215 --> 00:35:07.589
He promised to leave Toontown to us toons.

411
00:35:07.672 --> 00:35:09.631
That will is the reason he got bumped off.

412
00:35:09.672 --> 00:35:11.630
Has anybody ever seen this will?

413
00:35:11.671 --> 00:35:14.296
Uh, no. But he gave us his solemn oath.

414
00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:19.708
If you believe that that joker could do
anything solid, the gag's on you, pal.

415
00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:22.916
I just figured, since you were
the one who got my pal in trouble,

416
00:35:22.999 --> 00:35:24.998
you might want to help get him out.

417
00:35:25.081 --> 00:35:27.580
I can pay ya.

418
00:35:27.663 --> 00:35:30.786
Save your money for
a pair of elevator shoes.

419
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:34.285
- Wait! No, Valiant, no! Ow, my stogie!
- Oh!

420
00:35:35.826 --> 00:35:38.450
Wah!

421
00:35:38.532 --> 00:35:41.989
Wah!

422
00:35:42.114 --> 00:35:44.030
Wah!

423
00:35:49.194 --> 00:35:52.151
It ain't my fault the rabbit
got himself in trouble.

424
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.064
All I did was take
a couple of lousy pictures.

425
00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:22.136
Baby was right.

426
00:36:32.338 --> 00:36:34.212
The hell with it.

427
00:37:02.324 --> 00:37:04.406
- Aah!
- Aah!

428
00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.863
- How the hell did you get in here?
- Through the mail slot.

429
00:37:07.946 --> 00:37:11.862
I thought it would be best if I waited
inside, seeing's how I'm wanted for murder.

430
00:37:11.945 --> 00:37:15.276
No kidding. Just talking to you could
get me a rap for Aiding and Abetting.

431
00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:18.274
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?

432
00:37:18.357 --> 00:37:20.940
- Nobody. Not a soul, except, uh...
- Who?

433
00:37:21.065 --> 00:37:22.981
Well, you see,

434
00:37:23.064 --> 00:37:25.980
I didn't know where your office was.

435
00:37:26.063 --> 00:37:27.978
So I asked a newsboy.
He didn't know.

436
00:37:28.061 --> 00:37:30.810
So I asked the fireman, the greengrocer,
the butcher, the baker.

437
00:37:30.893 --> 00:37:33.933
They didn't know.
But the liquor store guy, he knew.

438
00:37:34.058 --> 00:37:36.223
- In other words, the whole
damn town knows you're here!
- Hey! Hey!

439
00:37:36.265 --> 00:37:38.390
- Come on! Come on!
- All right.
Eddie, take it easy, will ya?

440
00:37:38.472 --> 00:37:41.345
Please, Eddie, don't throw me out.
You're making a big mistake.

441
00:37:41.429 --> 00:37:43.594
I didn't kill anybody.
I swear!

442
00:37:43.678 --> 00:37:47.719
This whole thing's a setup,
a scam, a frame job. Ow!

443
00:37:47.844 --> 00:37:49.968
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody. Ow!

444
00:37:50.092 --> 00:37:53.339
My whole purpose...
in... life... is... to...

445
00:37:53.423 --> 00:37:56.880
make... people...

446
00:37:56.964 --> 00:38:00.046
laugh.

447
00:38:00.086 --> 00:38:02.211
Okay, okay, sure.
I admit it.

448
00:38:02.253 --> 00:38:06.042
I got a little steamed when
you showed me those pictures of Jessica,

449
00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:09.207
So I rushed over to the Ink and Paint Club.

450
00:38:09.249 --> 00:38:13.205
But she wasn't in her dressing room,
So I wrote her a love letter.

451
00:38:13.247 --> 00:38:15.870
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

452
00:38:15.954 --> 00:38:20.035
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy,
you wrote your wife a love letter?

453
00:38:20.118 --> 00:38:24.741
That's right. I know that she was just
an innocent victim of circumstance.

454
00:38:24.866 --> 00:38:27.698
I suppose you used the old
lipstick-on-the-mirror routine, huh?

455
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:29.697
Lipstick, yes.
Mirror, no.

456
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.861
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.
"Dear Jessica,

457
00:38:33.945 --> 00:38:38.068
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

458
00:38:38.151 --> 00:38:41.565
"One, one thousand. Two, one thousand.
Three, one thousand.

459
00:38:41.607 --> 00:38:44.731
- Four, one thousand. Five..."
- Why didn't you just leave
the letter there?

460
00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:49.062
Obviously, a poem of this power
and sensitivity must... Aah...

461
00:38:49.104 --> 00:38:51.061
be read in person.

462
00:38:51.103 --> 00:38:53.059
So I went home to wait for her.

463
00:38:53.101 --> 00:38:56.892
But the weasels were
there waitin' for me. So... So I ran.

464
00:38:56.976 --> 00:39:01.515
So why come to me? I'm the guy
that took the pictures of your wife.

465
00:39:01.598 --> 00:39:04.346
Yeah. And you're also the guy
that helped all these toons.

466
00:39:04.388 --> 00:39:09.219
Everybody knows when a toon's in trouble,
there's only one place to go:

467
00:39:09.302 --> 00:39:12.676
- Valiant and Valiant.
- Not anymore.

468
00:39:12.759 --> 00:39:15.341
Get outta that chair!

469
00:39:17.756 --> 00:39:21.671
- That's my brother's chair.
- Yeah, where is your brother, anyway?

470
00:39:21.754 --> 00:39:24.670
He looks like a sensitive...
and sober... fellow.

471
00:39:24.753 --> 00:39:27.210
That's it.
I'm callin' the cops.

472
00:39:27.252 --> 00:39:29.208
Go ahead,
Call the cops,

473
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.916
I come here for help, and what do you do?

474
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.373
You turn me in. No, no.
Don't feel guilty about me.

475
00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:38.788
So long, and thanks for nothin'.

476
00:39:40.203 --> 00:39:43.451
That's the closet!
Stupe.

477
00:39:56.529 --> 00:40:00.610
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.

478
00:40:00.693 --> 00:40:02.734
Get outta there!

479
00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:06.774
- Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.
- Huh?

480
00:40:08.856 --> 00:40:11.355
Yah!

481
00:40:14.603 --> 00:40:17.142
Come on.
Get the lead out.

482
00:40:17.184 --> 00:40:19.809
Move it, would ya? Move it!

483
00:40:19.933 --> 00:40:23.682
Yah! It's the Toon Patrol!

484
00:40:27.679 --> 00:40:30.220
Hide me, Eddie!
P-P-Please!

485
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:35.635
- Remember, you never saw me.
- Get outta there!

486
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.508
Don't let 'em find me.

487
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:41.547
Come on, Eddie.
You're my only hope.

488
00:40:41.631 --> 00:40:45.505
Open up in the name of the law.

489
00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:48.877
P-P-Please, Eddie, You know
there's no justice for toons anymore,

490
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.793
If the weasels get their hands on me,

491
00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:54.333
I'm as good as Dipped.

492
00:40:54.416 --> 00:40:56.415
Don't make us play rough, Valiant,

493
00:40:56.499 --> 00:40:58.955
We just want the rabbit.

494
00:40:58.997 --> 00:41:01.455
What're we gonna do, Eddie?
What're we gonna do?

495
00:41:01.497 --> 00:41:04.161
What are we gonna do?

496
00:41:04.244 --> 00:41:06.786
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.

497
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:20.612
Looks like they gave us the slip, huh, Boss?

498
00:41:20.695 --> 00:41:23.902
Nah. Valiant's got him stashed somewhere.

499
00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:27.940
Hold it right there.

500
00:41:29.981 --> 00:41:33.105
Hello, boys.
I didn't hear you come in.

501
00:41:34.146 --> 00:41:36.103
Okay, wise guy.

502
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:39.144
- Where's the rabbit?
- Haven't seen him.

503
00:41:39.227 --> 00:41:43.932
- What's in there?
- My lingerie.

504
00:41:43.974 --> 00:41:45.931
Geez, Valiant.

505
00:41:51.138 --> 00:41:54.219
Search the place, boys.

506
00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:57.052
And leave no stone "interned".

507
00:41:57.135 --> 00:42:01.425
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable
tip-off the rabbit was here.

508
00:42:01.467 --> 00:42:04.048
And it was "corrugated" by several others.

509
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:07.837
So cut the bull schtick.

510
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.252
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.

511
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:25.996
Stop that laughing!

512
00:42:29.993 --> 00:42:32.075
Stop that laughin'!

513
00:42:32.159 --> 00:42:35.907
You know what happens
when you can't stop laughin'.

514
00:42:39.738 --> 00:42:42.653
One of these days,
you're gonna die laughin'.

515
00:42:45.361 --> 00:42:48.109
As for you, Valiant, step outta line...

516
00:42:48.151 --> 00:42:52.939
and we'll hang you
and your laundry out to dry.

517
00:42:56.272 --> 00:42:59.687
Come on, boys.
Let's am-scray.

518
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:03.269
- They're gone.

519
00:43:03.352 --> 00:43:06.766
Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.
You saved my life.

520
00:43:06.808 --> 00:43:09.266
How can I ever repay ya?

521
00:43:11.307 --> 00:43:15.388
Blecch! For starters,
don't ever kiss me again.

522
00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:20.093
Will you stop kickin' me?

523
00:43:20.135 --> 00:43:22.092
Stop kickin' me.

524
00:43:23.675 --> 00:43:25.591
Dolores.

525
00:43:25.674 --> 00:43:28.423
Dolores. Dolores!

526
00:43:33.503 --> 00:43:35.878
Hey, Eddie, you made the front page today.

527
00:43:35.918 --> 00:43:38.501
- Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
- And what ink.

528
00:43:38.584 --> 00:43:41.499
Come on, Eddie.

529
00:43:45.788 --> 00:43:47.746
So tell me, Eddie,

530
00:43:47.788 --> 00:43:51.910
is that a rabbit in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?

531
00:43:51.994 --> 00:43:54.659
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.

532
00:43:54.742 --> 00:43:58.283
- I gotta get outta these cuffs.
- Oh, swell.

533
00:43:58.366 --> 00:44:00.282
Whew!

534
00:44:00.365 --> 00:44:02.822
Jeepers, Eddie, That almost killed me,

535
00:44:02.905 --> 00:44:07.319
- Ow.
- Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?

536
00:44:07.403 --> 00:44:09.818
It's a rotgut room,
hold over from Prohibition.

537
00:44:09.901 --> 00:44:13.317
Oh, I get it, a speak easy.
A gin mill. A hooch parlor.

538
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:15.316
- Tools are up here, Eddie.
- Look at this!

539
00:44:15.399 --> 00:44:17.605
- Aah!
- It's a spy hole.

540
00:44:17.689 --> 00:44:20.480
Jeepers, Eddie,
this'd be a great place to hide.

541
00:44:22.229 --> 00:44:24.853
- Crazy toons. Oof!
- Watch your head.

542
00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.516
I thought you said
you'd never take another toon case.

543
00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:32.141
- What'd you have, a change of heart?
- Nothin's changed.

544
00:44:32.224 --> 00:44:35.473
Somebody's made a patsy outta me,
and I'm gonna find out why.

545
00:44:43.052 --> 00:44:45.508
Hold still, will ya?

546
00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:49.632
- Does this help?
- Yeah, thanks.

547
00:44:54.046 --> 00:44:57.544
Do you mean to tell me that you could have
taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?

548
00:44:57.669 --> 00:45:01.751
- No, not at any time. Only when it was funny.
- Get outta here!

549
00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:05.040
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?

550
00:45:05.124 --> 00:45:07.872
He always this funny, or only
on days when he's wanted for murder?

551
00:45:07.956 --> 00:45:09.871
Listen.
My "silosophy" is this.

552
00:45:09.955 --> 00:45:12.745
If you don't have a good sense
of humor, you're better off dead.

553
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:16.160
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.

554
00:45:16.202 --> 00:45:18.159
What is it, Eddie?

555
00:45:18.201 --> 00:45:20.616
Just look at it.

556
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.573
- Mr. Acme's will.
- Yeah,

557
00:45:22.657 --> 00:45:26.863
And I think Maroon played the part of sound
mind, and your wife, the sound body.

558
00:45:26.905 --> 00:45:29.611
- Why, I resent that innuendo.
- What's the scheme, Eddie?

559
00:45:29.695 --> 00:45:32.985
- I don't think they got to the will.
- But how do you know?

560
00:45:33.027 --> 00:45:35.900
Because they were still lookin'
for it after they killed him.

561
00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:38.233
Anything I can do?

562
00:45:38.316 --> 00:45:40.814
Maybe you could go downtown
and check the probate.

563
00:45:40.855 --> 00:45:42.814
Yeah, check the probate.

564
00:45:42.855 --> 00:45:45.313
Why, my Uncle Thumper had
a problem with his probate.

565
00:45:45.355 --> 00:45:49.477
And he had to take these
big pills and drink lots of water.

566
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.517
Not prostate, you idiot.
Probate.

567
00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.516
Let me get this straight.

568
00:45:54.599 --> 00:45:56.723
You think that my boss, R.K. Maroon,

569
00:45:56.807 --> 00:45:59.472
dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head...

570
00:45:59.555 --> 00:46:01.888
so that he could get his hands on Toontown?

571
00:46:01.972 --> 00:46:03.970
Yep.

572
00:46:04.053 --> 00:46:06.510
That's my hunch.

573
00:46:06.593 --> 00:46:10.549
Uh, can he stay here for a couple of days?

574
00:46:10.633 --> 00:46:13.548
Not gonna do anything crazy, is he?

575
00:46:19.336 --> 00:46:22.252
- Where are you goin'?
- Back to the office.

576
00:46:24.376 --> 00:46:28.083
Mr. Valiant? Mr. Valiant?

577
00:46:34.247 --> 00:46:37.162
You've got the wrong idea
about me, Mr. Valiant.

578
00:46:37.204 --> 00:46:39.910
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.

579
00:46:39.993 --> 00:46:43.200
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price.

580
00:46:43.283 --> 00:46:45.200
And I'll pay it.

581
00:46:45.283 --> 00:46:47.199
Yeah. I'll bet you would.

582
00:46:47.282 --> 00:46:50.738
You gotta have the rabbit
to make the scam work.

583
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:54.569
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.

584
00:46:54.653 --> 00:46:58.235
You don't know how hard
it is being a woman...

585
00:46:58.317 --> 00:47:00.234
Iooking the way I do.

586
00:47:00.316 --> 00:47:02.233
Yeah, well,

587
00:47:02.315 --> 00:47:05.897
you don't know how hard it is being a man...

588
00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.854
Iooking at a woman looking the way you do.

589
00:47:08.938 --> 00:47:12.894
I'm not bad.
I'm just drawn that way.

590
00:47:17.307 --> 00:47:20.890
Weren't you the one I caught playin'
patty-cake with Old Man Acme?

591
00:47:20.973 --> 00:47:24.471
You didn't catch me, Mr. Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.

592
00:47:24.554 --> 00:47:28.053
- What are you talkin' about?
- Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.

593
00:47:28.136 --> 00:47:30.259
I didn't want to have
anything to do with it.

594
00:47:30.343 --> 00:47:33.549
But he said, if I didn't pose
for those patty-cake pictures,

595
00:47:33.633 --> 00:47:38.007
Roger would never work in this town
again. I couldn't let that happen.

596
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.754
I'd do anything for my husband, Mr. Valiant.

597
00:47:41.795 --> 00:47:44.920
- Anything.
- What a wife.

598
00:47:44.961 --> 00:47:48.876
I'm desperate, Mr. Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?

599
00:47:48.959 --> 00:47:51.874
Dabblin' in water colors, Eddie?

600
00:47:53.165 --> 00:47:55.705
Well.

601
00:47:56.955 --> 00:47:59.121
Sorry.

602
00:47:59.204 --> 00:48:03.118
Good-bye, Eddie.
My offer stands firm.

603
00:48:03.201 --> 00:48:05.867
Think about it.

604
00:48:13.906 --> 00:48:16.528
Well!

605
00:48:16.611 --> 00:48:19.777
Do you want to tell me what she was
doing with her arms around you?

606
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.275
Probably lookin' for a good place
to stick a knife.

607
00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:26.066
- Oh, come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!
- Yeah, but...

608
00:48:26.148 --> 00:48:27.856
Dolores, come...

609
00:48:31.021 --> 00:48:32.937
Come on, Dolores.

610
00:48:33.021 --> 00:48:35.561
You don't believe a painted hussy
like that could turn my head.

611
00:48:35.644 --> 00:48:37.602
She's just tryin' to get
her hands on the rabbit.

612
00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:39.892
That's not all she's trying
to get her hands on.

613
00:48:39.933 --> 00:48:42.891
Now look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.

614
00:48:42.932 --> 00:48:46.388
Look, I want you to go out. I want you
to buy yourself a new swimsuit.

615
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.387
'Cause you and me are goin' to Catalina.

616
00:48:48.429 --> 00:48:52.053
- I'm on the verge of wrappin' up this case.
- No, you're not, Eddie.

617
00:48:52.094 --> 00:48:55.550
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.

618
00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:59.340
Maroon's not after Toontown,
like you thought.

619
00:48:59.424 --> 00:49:02.255
It's Cloverleaf that wants
to get their hands on Toontown.

620
00:49:02.297 --> 00:49:04.254
They put in the highest bid.

621
00:49:04.296 --> 00:49:07.169
And unless Mr. Acme's will shows up
by midnight tonight,

622
00:49:07.252 --> 00:49:09.710
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.

623
00:49:09.793 --> 00:49:12.250
What? At midnight tonight?

624
00:49:12.375 --> 00:49:14.291
That's right.

625
00:49:14.374 --> 00:49:19.288
First they buy the Red Car. Then they
want to get their hands on Toontown.

626
00:49:19.371 --> 00:49:21.746
- I don't get it.
- Shh!

627
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:24.244
Roger.

628
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:29.742
The rabbit. Get the Judge.

629
00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.741
#A joke
Don't sit there on your brain#

630
00:49:32.782 --> 00:49:37.071
Nice shirt.
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?

631
00:49:37.113 --> 00:49:40.610
# My buddy's Eddie V.
A sourpuss, you'll see #

632
00:49:40.694 --> 00:49:43.943
# But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'Cause a joker he will be #

633
00:49:44.026 --> 00:49:47.774
# C, D, E, F, G, H, I #

634
00:49:47.858 --> 00:49:52.105
# I love to raise some Cain
Believe me, it's no strain #

635
00:49:52.188 --> 00:49:54.062
# It feels so great
to smash a plate #

636
00:49:54.146 --> 00:49:56.895
#And look, there is no pain
No pain #

637
00:49:56.937 --> 00:49:58.769
- # No pain, no pain #
- Ow!

638
00:49:58.853 --> 00:50:02.392
#No pain, no pain, no... ##

639
00:50:02.475 --> 00:50:05.974
Oh!

640
00:50:06.056 --> 00:50:10.138
Eddie, what are ya... Yah!

641
00:50:10.221 --> 00:50:13.387
Hey, who turned out the lights?

642
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.176
I can't see a thing.
What's goin' on?

643
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.551
You crazy rabbit,

644
00:50:18.634 --> 00:50:21.049
I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.

645
00:50:21.133 --> 00:50:24.089
And what are you doin'?
Singin' and dancin'!

646
00:50:26.213 --> 00:50:29.003
But I'm a toon. Toons are
supposed to make people laugh.

647
00:50:29.044 --> 00:50:33.501
- Sit down!
- You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.

648
00:50:33.585 --> 00:50:36.041
Yeah, and when they're done laughing,
they'll call the cops.

649
00:50:36.083 --> 00:50:38.374
That guy, Angelo,
would rat on you for a nickel.

650
00:50:38.416 --> 00:50:40.997
Not Angelo.
He'd never turn me in.

651
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.954
- Why? Because you made him laugh?
- That's right.

652
00:50:44.037 --> 00:50:47.078
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.

653
00:50:47.161 --> 00:50:50.869
Why, sometimes in life,
it's the only weapon we have.

654
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:52.908
- Laughter is the most im...
- Shh.

655
00:50:52.991 --> 00:50:56.907
Ix-nay. Ix-nay.

656
00:51:03.027 --> 00:51:05.443
I'm looking for a murderer.

657
00:51:17.688 --> 00:51:19.603
A rabbit.

658
00:51:22.185 --> 00:51:24.768
A toon rabbit...

659
00:51:24.852 --> 00:51:29.265
about yea... big.

660
00:51:29.348 --> 00:51:32.930
Look, there's no rabbit here.

661
00:51:33.013 --> 00:51:34.929
So don't harass my customers.

662
00:51:35.012 --> 00:51:39.468
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.

663
00:52:14.493 --> 00:52:17.865
Hey. I seen a rabbit.

664
00:52:17.949 --> 00:52:20.657
Where?

665
00:52:20.823 --> 00:52:22.656
Ya see?

666
00:52:28.901 --> 00:52:32.150
- Where?
- He's right here in the bar.

667
00:52:38.731 --> 00:52:41.521
Well, say hello, Harvey.

668
00:52:47.268 --> 00:52:49.892
I told ya so.

669
00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.087
"Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"

670
00:53:16.794 --> 00:53:21.085
Quite a loony selection for
a group of drunken reprobates.

671
00:53:27.623 --> 00:53:29.538
He's here!

672
00:53:33.286 --> 00:53:37.285
Stop that laughing!

673
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:43.657
Have you forgotten what happened last time?

674
00:53:43.781 --> 00:53:46.863
If you don't stop this laughing,
you're gonna end up dead,

675
00:53:46.947 --> 00:53:49.529
just like your idiot hyena cousins!

676
00:53:49.613 --> 00:53:53.568
Say, Boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?

677
00:53:53.692 --> 00:53:55.609
No, Sergeant.

678
00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:59.107
Disassembling the place won't be necessary.

679
00:53:59.149 --> 00:54:03.687
The rabbit is going to come right to me.

680
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:08.685
- Gee.
- No toon...

681
00:54:08.769 --> 00:54:13.142
can resist the old
shave-and-a-haircut trick.

682
00:54:20.055 --> 00:54:23.387
- I don't know who's toonier, you or Doom.

683
00:54:23.429 --> 00:54:25.802
Roger.

684
00:54:28.674 --> 00:54:30.924
Ro... Roger!

685
00:54:32.424 --> 00:54:35.713
Roger, no.

686
00:54:37.962 --> 00:54:40.960
Roger, don't, Roger.

687
00:54:42.044 --> 00:54:45.542
# Shave and a haircut #

688
00:54:47.665 --> 00:54:50.332
#Two bits ##

689
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:58.328
Hey, Judge, what should we do
with the wallflower?

690
00:54:58.411 --> 00:55:00.576
We'll see to him later.

691
00:55:00.701 --> 00:55:04.781
Right now, I feel like
dispensing some justice.

692
00:55:04.865 --> 00:55:07.198
Bring me some Dip.

693
00:55:07.448 --> 00:55:09.447
Aah!

694
00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:17.567
Does the Condemned have anything to say
before his sentence is carried out?

695
00:55:17.692 --> 00:55:19.649
Why, yeah...

696
00:55:21.565 --> 00:55:23.523
Wah!

697
00:55:24.606 --> 00:55:26.937
Dolores, bourbon.
And make it a double.

698
00:55:27.021 --> 00:55:29.519
Fine time for a drink, Eddie.

699
00:55:29.603 --> 00:55:33.185
- Maybe you'd like a bowl
of pretzels to go with it!
- Just pour the drink, Dolores.

700
00:55:39.015 --> 00:55:41.431
Hey, Judge?

701
00:55:41.513 --> 00:55:43.929
Don't a dyin' rabbit deserve a last request?

702
00:55:44.013 --> 00:55:46.762
Yeah, Noseplugs would be nice!

703
00:55:46.845 --> 00:55:49.470
I think you want a drink.

704
00:55:50.717 --> 00:55:53.300
How 'bout it, Judge?

705
00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:55.299
Well, why not?

706
00:55:55.382 --> 00:55:58.339
I don't mind prolonging the execution.

707
00:55:58.464 --> 00:56:01.546
- Happy trails.
- No thanks, Eddie. I'm tryin' to cut down.

708
00:56:01.671 --> 00:56:04.086
- Drink the drink.
- But I don't want the drink.

709
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.501
- He doesn't want the drink.
- He does!
- I don't.

710
00:56:06.543 --> 00:56:07.917
- You do. You do.
- I don't. I don't.

711
00:56:08.001 --> 00:56:10.875
- You do. You don't.
- I don't. I do,

712
00:56:10.916 --> 00:56:13.457
- You don't. You don't.
- I do.

713
00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:17.662
Listen, when I say, "I do",
that means I do!

714
00:56:30.531 --> 00:56:33.863
Aah!

715
00:56:55.476 --> 00:56:57.475
Gotcha, kid.

716
00:57:02.182 --> 00:57:04.805
Come on, Eddie, let's get outta here!

717
00:57:04.847 --> 00:57:07.179
Move it, pops.
Yikes!

718
00:57:08.263 --> 00:57:10.178
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.

719
00:57:10.262 --> 00:57:13.052
Nothin' like usin' the ol' spine flower,
the wise noodle, the...

720
00:57:13.136 --> 00:57:16.757
- Roger! Let's use this.
- Yah!

721
00:57:16.882 --> 00:57:20.423
- Let's get outta here.
What're you waitin' for?
- There's no damn key.

722
00:57:20.506 --> 00:57:22.964
Hey, you weasels,
lemme outta here, will ya?

723
00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:27.044
- Come on, I gotta make a livin'.
- Benny, is that you?

724
00:57:27.128 --> 00:57:29.252
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.

725
00:57:29.334 --> 00:57:31.792
Come on, Roger, get me outta here.

726
00:57:31.875 --> 00:57:35.832
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride.
Open the doors!

727
00:57:40.954 --> 00:57:43.744
- Whoo!
- Ahh, that's better.

728
00:57:43.828 --> 00:57:46.618
I can't believe they locked me up
for drivin' on the sidewalk.

729
00:57:46.702 --> 00:57:49.243
Come on, Eddie.
Get in.

730
00:57:49.325 --> 00:57:51.241
It was just a couple of miles.

731
00:57:51.323 --> 00:57:53.322
- I'll drive.
- But I wanna drive.

732
00:57:53.447 --> 00:57:55.822
No, I'll drive.
I'm the cab.

733
00:57:55.863 --> 00:57:58.612
Outta my way, pencil-neck!

734
00:57:58.696 --> 00:58:00.653
How about this weather, huh?

735
00:58:00.695 --> 00:58:03.985
It never rains.

736
00:58:04.026 --> 00:58:06.192
They sprung the cab.
Let's go.

737
00:58:06.275 --> 00:58:09.940
And how about those Brooklyn Dodgers?
Are they bums, or what?

738
00:58:10.023 --> 00:58:12.313
Move over, I'm drivin'.

739
00:58:14.437 --> 00:58:16.435
Benny, Eddie, we got company!

740
00:58:16.561 --> 00:58:20.601
- Would you look at these two...
Excuse me, ladies.

741
00:58:20.685 --> 00:58:23.975
- Now that's what I call
a couple of road hogs.

742
00:58:24.058 --> 00:58:25.641
- I'm gonna blow his head off.

743
00:58:25.766 --> 00:58:30.679
Benny, look out for the Red Car!

744
00:58:33.053 --> 00:58:37.635
Whoa!

745
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.715
Benny, there's cops right behind us!

746
00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:43.422
Not for long, Roger.

747
00:58:43.506 --> 00:58:46.380
Now they're right in front of us.

748
00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:50.461
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around!

749
00:58:50.544 --> 00:58:53.960
Gimme the wheel.
Gimme the wheel!

750
00:58:56.792 --> 00:58:58.749
The cops are still on our tail.

751
00:58:58.791 --> 00:59:00.998
I know the cops are on our tail.
What do you think I am, bli... Benny!

752
00:59:03.538 --> 00:59:05.787
Pull the lever!

753
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:07.577
- Which one?
- Which one?

754
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:10.243
"Which one"?

755
00:59:10.326 --> 00:59:12.909
I'm gonna ram 'em.

756
00:59:13.991 --> 00:59:17.948
Whoa!

757
00:59:18.031 --> 00:59:20.363
I'm gettin' too old for this.

758
00:59:22.821 --> 00:59:24.486
Aah!

759
00:59:24.486 --> 00:59:25.985
Aah!

760
00:59:27.776 --> 00:59:31.774
- Jumpin' jeepers.
- Hey, Roger, what do you call
the middle of a song?

761
00:59:31.857 --> 00:59:35.814
Gee, I don't know...
A bridge! Aah!

762
00:59:35.897 --> 00:59:38.937
Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?

763
00:59:39.062 --> 00:59:41.977
- Somewhere we can hide.
- I got just the place.

764
00:59:42.061 --> 00:59:46.975
And incidentally, if you should ever
need a ride, just stick out your thumb.

765
00:59:47.059 --> 00:59:49.848
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?

766
00:59:49.932 --> 00:59:54.513
Ah, now that wasn't so bad, was it?

767
01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:10.755
Boy, did you see that?

768
01:00:10.838 --> 01:00:12.879
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.

769
01:00:13.004 --> 01:00:16.417
What timing. What finesse.
What a genius.

770
01:00:16.501 --> 01:00:20.416
Ouch!

771
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.623
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?

772
01:00:23.706 --> 01:00:25.623
Ow. What's wrong with you?

773
01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:28.453
You're the only person
in this theater that isn't laughing.

774
01:00:28.536 --> 01:00:31.952
Is there nothing that can
permeate your impervious puss?

775
01:00:32.036 --> 01:00:34.201
Hey, Eddie.

776
01:00:34.284 --> 01:00:36.241
Boy, nothin'.

777
01:00:36.283 --> 01:00:41.072
What could have possibly happened to
you to turn you into such a sourpuss?

778
01:00:41.155 --> 01:00:43.071
You wanna know?

779
01:00:43.154 --> 01:00:46.111
I'll tell you.
A toon killed my brother.

780
01:00:46.195 --> 01:00:48.110
A toon? No.

781
01:00:48.194 --> 01:00:51.609
That's right, a toon.

782
01:00:51.692 --> 01:00:55.482
We were investigating a robbery
of the First National Bank of Toontown.

783
01:00:55.565 --> 01:00:59.022
Back in those days,
me and Teddy liked workin' Toontown.

784
01:00:59.105 --> 01:01:02.062
Thought it was a lot of laughs.

785
01:01:02.103 --> 01:01:06.060
Anyway, this guy...

786
01:01:06.101 --> 01:01:09.183
got away with a zillion simoleons.

787
01:01:12.057 --> 01:01:15.889
We trailed him to a little dive
down on Yockster Street.

788
01:01:15.931 --> 01:01:17.888
We went in.

789
01:01:19.595 --> 01:01:21.677
Only he got the drop on us.

790
01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:24.217
Literally.

791
01:01:24.259 --> 01:01:27.341
Dropped a piano on us from 15 stories.

792
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:33.171
Broke my arm.
Teddy never made it.

793
01:01:34.755 --> 01:01:37.794
I never did find out who that guy was.

794
01:01:37.878 --> 01:01:42.708
All I rememberwas, he was
standin' over me, laughin',

795
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:46.040
with those burnin' red eyes...

796
01:01:46.081 --> 01:01:48.539
and that high, squeaky voice.

797
01:01:50.746 --> 01:01:53.703
He disappeared into Toontown after that.

798
01:01:53.786 --> 01:01:58.701
No wonder you hate me.

799
01:01:58.743 --> 01:02:02.615
If a toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too.

800
01:02:02.698 --> 01:02:05.946
Come on, don't cry.
I don't hate ya.

801
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.987
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

802
01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:10.028
You do hate me.

803
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:13.527
Otherwise you wouldn't have
yanked my ears all those times.

804
01:02:13.569 --> 01:02:16.149
All right, I'm...
I'm sorry I yanked your ears.

805
01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.981
All the times you yanked my ears?

806
01:02:19.023 --> 01:02:21.480
All the times I yanked your ears.

807
01:02:21.522 --> 01:02:23.521
Apology accepted.

808
01:02:23.605 --> 01:02:25.770
Put 'er there, pal.
I feel bet...

809
01:02:25.854 --> 01:02:29.393
Oh, boy, I hope it's another cartoon!

810
01:02:29.477 --> 01:02:33.308
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.

811
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:36.098
I hate the news.

812
01:02:36.182 --> 01:02:38.263
So you got all my stuff?

813
01:02:38.346 --> 01:02:43.261
Yes. It's all packed up in the car outside.

814
01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:48.092
Would have been here right after you
called, but I had to shake the weasels.

815
01:02:48.176 --> 01:02:53.089
Yeah. I'm sorry
about the trouble in the bar.

816
01:02:53.173 --> 01:02:56.880
Well, hell, stuffing olives
for a livin' wasn't for me anyway.

817
01:02:58.254 --> 01:03:00.170
Dolores?

818
01:03:02.917 --> 01:03:05.833
You ought to find yourself a good man.

819
01:03:09.081 --> 01:03:11.997
But I already have a good man.

820
01:03:18.411 --> 01:03:21.451
P-P-Please, don't mind me.

821
01:03:23.991 --> 01:03:25.948
You better get going, Eddie.

822
01:03:28.655 --> 01:03:30.612
A near miss,

823
01:03:30.654 --> 01:03:33.445
But this miss says,
that's as good as a smile.

824
01:03:33.486 --> 01:03:35.943
California Cloverleaf...

825
01:03:35.985 --> 01:03:39.483
I'm glad Teddy's not here to see me runnin'
away with my tail between my legs.

826
01:03:39.567 --> 01:03:43.106
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

827
01:03:43.148 --> 01:03:45.771
The Pacific Red Cartrolley line...

828
01:03:45.813 --> 01:03:48.479
and the venerated Maroon Cartoon Studios,

829
01:03:48.563 --> 01:03:51.810
Here R. K. Maroon is seen
clinching the deal...

830
01:03:51.893 --> 01:03:54.517
with Cloverleaf's bankers and execs...

831
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:58.099
in one of the biggest real estate
deals ever in California history.

832
01:03:58.141 --> 01:04:00.764
- That's it!
- Three and a half million dollars for a...

833
01:04:00.806 --> 01:04:02.887
That's the connection!

834
01:04:11.342 --> 01:04:14.298
Let's forget it, There's nobody here.

835
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.297
Is that it, or are you scared?

836
01:04:16.339 --> 01:04:19.547
P-P-Please! Me scared?
Don't be ridiculous.

837
01:04:21.295 --> 01:04:24.253
When you called Maroon,
you told him you had the will.

838
01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:27.750
But you don't.
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

839
01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:30.166
He might try to kill ya.

840
01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:32.207
I can handle a Hollywood cream puff.

841
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:35.414
I just don't want the odds to change.
You cover my back.

842
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.911
And if you hear or see anything,
beep the horn twice.

843
01:04:39.953 --> 01:04:43.076
Yeah, that's it.
Beep the horn twice. Cover your back.

844
01:04:43.118 --> 01:04:47.740
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up,
eyes peeled, ears to the ground.

845
01:04:47.782 --> 01:04:51.656
Why, nobody gets the drop on Roger Rabbit.

846
01:05:12.895 --> 01:05:14.935
- Aah!
- What's up, doc?

847
01:05:15.018 --> 01:05:17.101
Valiant, what are you tryin' to do,
give me a heart attack?

848
01:05:17.184 --> 01:05:19.517
You need a heart
before you can have an attack.

849
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.431
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ya got the will?
- Sure.

850
01:05:23.515 --> 01:05:25.431
I got the will.

851
01:05:27.263 --> 01:05:29.719
Question is, do you have the way?

852
01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:32.469
'Cause I can tell you now,
it ain't gonna come cheap.

853
01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:35.218
You got a lot of brass,
coming up here by yourself.

854
01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.259
Who said I'm here by myself?

855
01:05:49.086 --> 01:05:51.292
Lemme see that will.

856
01:05:51.376 --> 01:05:53.582
- I told you I got it.
- I wanna see it now!

857
01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.123
- I told you I got it.
- I wanna see it now!

858
01:05:57.789 --> 01:06:02.119
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?

859
01:06:02.203 --> 01:06:05.244
- This supposed to be a joke?
- No. This is.

860
01:06:10.408 --> 01:06:12.324
Get up. Come on.

861
01:06:12.407 --> 01:06:15.322
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?

862
01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:19.320
I'm gonna listen to you spin
the Cloverleaf scenario,

863
01:06:19.403 --> 01:06:23.318
the story of greed, sex and murder.

864
01:06:23.401 --> 01:06:27.316
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.

865
01:06:27.399 --> 01:06:30.730
You got it all wrong.
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!

866
01:06:30.814 --> 01:06:33.021
Everybody's gotta have a hobby.

867
01:06:34.105 --> 01:06:36.770
Oh, stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!

868
01:06:36.853 --> 01:06:40.267
The truth is, I had a chance
to sell my studio.

869
01:06:40.351 --> 01:06:43.475
But Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property
unless Acme sold 'em his.

870
01:06:43.557 --> 01:06:45.474
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell,

871
01:06:45.556 --> 01:06:48.555
so I was gonna blackmail Acme with
pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

872
01:06:48.639 --> 01:06:52.511
Blackmail, that's all,
I've been around toons all my life.

873
01:06:52.552 --> 01:06:55.593
- I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
- Toons destroyed?

874
01:06:55.676 --> 01:06:57.926
- Why?
- If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.

875
01:06:58.009 --> 01:07:01.549
- You're a dead man if you don't tell me.
- Unless Acme's will shows...

876
01:07:01.632 --> 01:07:06.837
by midnight tonight, Toontown's
gonna be left for the free... Aah!

877
01:07:30.369 --> 01:07:32.368
Roger!

878
01:08:38.583 --> 01:08:41.124
- What?
- What in Sam Hill?

879
01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:45.455
Eddie Valiant.
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes.

880
01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:49.370
- I ain't seen you to nigh onto five years.
- Where ya been?

881
01:08:49.454 --> 01:08:51.452
Drunk.

882
01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:53.868
Feelin' frisky tonight, fellas?

883
01:08:53.951 --> 01:08:55.783
Yeah!

884
01:08:55.867 --> 01:08:58.365
Let's go.

885
01:08:58.449 --> 01:09:01.614
Yahoo!

886
01:09:59.293 --> 01:10:02.958
# Smile
Darn ya, smile #

887
01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:08.581
#You know this old world
is a great world after all #

888
01:10:08.664 --> 01:10:12.412
# Smile
Darn ya, smile #

889
01:10:12.454 --> 01:10:17.701
#And right away watch
Lady Luck pay you a call #

890
01:10:17.784 --> 01:10:22.282
#Things are never
black as they are painted #

891
01:10:22.365 --> 01:10:26.612
- #Time for you and joy to get acquainted ##
- Hi, Eddie.

892
01:10:26.696 --> 01:10:30.652
Hi, Eddie. Hi, Eddie.
Bye, Eddie.

893
01:10:42.563 --> 01:10:45.937
Tallyho! Tallyho!

894
01:10:56.764 --> 01:10:58.723
Get outta here.

895
01:11:09.216 --> 01:11:11.507
Going up, sir.

896
01:11:12.882 --> 01:11:14.880
Yah!

897
01:11:16.421 --> 01:11:19.545
Mind the step, sir.

898
01:11:19.586 --> 01:11:22.961
Hold on, sir.

899
01:11:23.044 --> 01:11:25.874
Yah!

900
01:11:29.289 --> 01:11:31.956
Your floor, sir.

901
01:11:32.039 --> 01:11:36.412
Have a good day, sir.

902
01:11:39.909 --> 01:11:42.449
Ah, Gotcha.

903
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:49.114
A man!

904
01:11:55.902 --> 01:11:58.275
Yoo-hoo, lover-boy!

905
01:11:58.359 --> 01:12:00.441
It's Lena Hyena!

906
01:12:03.855 --> 01:12:06.021
Aah!

907
01:12:06.105 --> 01:12:09.728
Oh, no!

908
01:12:09.812 --> 01:12:12.477
Aah!

909
01:12:17.224 --> 01:12:20.847
- Oh, wook, piggies!
- Hi, Tweety.

910
01:12:20.931 --> 01:12:23.054
This little piggy went to market.

911
01:12:23.137 --> 01:12:25.388
- This little piggy stayed home.
- No.

912
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.761
This little piggy had roast beef.

913
01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:31.092
- And this little piggy had...
- Aah!

914
01:12:31.175 --> 01:12:33.049
Uh-oh. Ran outta piggies.

915
01:12:33.132 --> 01:12:36.465
Yah!

916
01:12:38.546 --> 01:12:41.420
Eh, what's up, doc?
Jumpin' without a parachute?

917
01:12:41.504 --> 01:12:43.419
- Kinda dangerous, ain't it?
- Yeah.

918
01:12:43.503 --> 01:12:46.919
- Yeah, you could get killed.
- You guys got a spare?

919
01:12:47.001 --> 01:12:49.084
- Uh, Bugs does.
- Yeah?

920
01:12:49.167 --> 01:12:51.082
Yeah, but I don't think you want it.

921
01:12:51.165 --> 01:12:53.206
- I do, I do. Give it to me.
- Gee.

922
01:12:53.289 --> 01:12:55.497
- Better let him have it, Bugs.
- Okay, doc.

923
01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:59.203
- Whatever you say. Here's the spare.
- Thank you.

924
01:13:02.034 --> 01:13:05.492
Aw, no! Ahh!

925
01:13:05.617 --> 01:13:09.323
- Aw, poor fella. Ha, ha.
- Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?

926
01:13:09.406 --> 01:13:11.531
Aah!

927
01:13:11.614 --> 01:13:14.570
- My man!

928
01:13:19.026 --> 01:13:21.484
Come to Lena!

929
01:13:26.523 --> 01:13:28.480
Ooh!

930
01:13:28.522 --> 01:13:31.187
Toons. Gets 'em every time.

931
01:13:49.304 --> 01:13:51.677
- Gesund heit.
- Thank you.

932
01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.635
Valiant.

933
01:13:58.633 --> 01:14:01.547
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.

934
01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:05.170
Behind you!

935
01:14:05.253 --> 01:14:08.710
- Drop it, lady.
- I just saved your life
and you still don't trust me?

936
01:14:08.794 --> 01:14:12.292
- I don't trust anybody or anything.
- Not even your own eyes?

937
01:14:12.334 --> 01:14:16.539
That's the gun that killed R. K. Maroon,
And Doom pulled the trigger.

938
01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:20.538
- Doom?
- I followed him to the studio.
But I was too late to stop him.

939
01:14:20.621 --> 01:14:22.828
That's right, You'll never stop me!

940
01:14:22.912 --> 01:14:26.326
- You're dead! You're all dead!
- Doom!

941
01:14:28.949 --> 01:14:31.365
- Which way'd he go?
- Well, I don't know...

942
01:14:31.449 --> 01:14:34.698
- But... He went that away.
- Let's go!

943
01:14:34.781 --> 01:14:37.944
- Dumdums. Yeah.
- Come on.

944
01:14:37.986 --> 01:14:41.027
Oh, no. Where's Roger?

945
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:45.108
- Roger? He chickened out on me,
back at the studio.
- No, he didn't.

946
01:14:45.192 --> 01:14:48.857
I hit him on the head
with a frying pan and put him in the trunk,
so he wouldn't get hurt.

947
01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.855
Makes perfect sense.

948
01:14:50.938 --> 01:14:53.355
We're obviously not going anywhere
in my car, let's take yours.

949
01:14:55.978 --> 01:14:58.102
I got a feeling somebody already did.

950
01:14:58.186 --> 01:15:00.768
From the looks of it, I'd say it was Roger.

951
01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:03.475
My honey-bunny was never
very good behind the wheel.

952
01:15:03.558 --> 01:15:07.139
- A better lover than a driver, huh?
- You'd better believe it, buster.

953
01:15:07.222 --> 01:15:09.138
Uh-oh. It's the weasels.

954
01:15:09.221 --> 01:15:11.137
- This way. We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
- No, wait.

955
01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.179
No, no.
Gingerbread Lane's this way.

956
01:15:13.262 --> 01:15:17.092
So Valiant, you call a cab, or what?

957
01:15:17.134 --> 01:15:21.299
Hubba, hubba, hubba.
Allow me, madam-oiselle.

958
01:15:23.922 --> 01:15:26.129
So how long have you known it was Doom?

959
01:15:26.212 --> 01:15:28.919
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed,
he confided in me...

960
01:15:29.003 --> 01:15:32.792
that Doom wanted to get his hands on
Toontown, and he wouldn't stop at anything.

961
01:15:32.834 --> 01:15:35.750
- So he gave you the will for safekeeping?
- That's what he told me.

962
01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:39.332
Except when I opened the envelope, there
was only a blank piece of paper inside.

963
01:15:39.415 --> 01:15:42.122
- Huh. A joker to the end.
- So where to, already?

964
01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.454
- My meter's runnin'.
- I have to find my darling husband,

965
01:15:45.537 --> 01:15:47.453
I'm so worried about him.

966
01:15:47.536 --> 01:15:51.451
- Seriously, what do you see in that guy?
- He makes me laugh.

967
01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:01.238
Aah!

968
01:16:01.321 --> 01:16:04.901
Whoa, I've been Dipped!

969
01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:13.398
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
What an unfortunate accident.

970
01:16:13.439 --> 01:16:16.187
Nothing more treacherous
than a slippery road,

971
01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:20.186
especially when driving
in a maniacal toon vehicle.

972
01:16:22.561 --> 01:16:24.476
- Good work, Boss.

973
01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.141
Don't just stand there.
Help them.

974
01:16:27.224 --> 01:16:30.222
- Put them in my car.
- Follow me.

975
01:16:30.264 --> 01:16:33.721
I think they'll enjoy attending
the ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.

976
01:16:33.762 --> 01:16:36.053
Come on, you mugs.

977
01:16:48.423 --> 01:16:51.794
We searched Valiant, Boss.
The will ain't on 'im.

978
01:16:51.878 --> 01:16:53.752
Then frisk the woman!

979
01:16:53.794 --> 01:16:56.584
I'll handle this one.

980
01:17:01.873 --> 01:17:05.663
Nice booby trap.

981
01:17:13.326 --> 01:17:15.740
Do they have the will, or not?

982
01:17:15.824 --> 01:17:18.032
- Nah, just this stupid love letter.
- No matter.

983
01:17:18.074 --> 01:17:22.738
I doubt if that will is going to show up
in the next 15 minutes, anyway.

984
01:17:22.822 --> 01:17:26.527
- What happens in the next 15 minutes?
- Toontown will be legally mine,

985
01:17:26.610 --> 01:17:28.734
lock, stock and barrel.

986
01:17:34.607 --> 01:17:37.149
Benny, is that you?

987
01:17:37.232 --> 01:17:41.854
No, it's Shirley Temple.
Ahh! Oh! Eee!

988
01:17:41.895 --> 01:17:43.853
Jumpin' jeepers, what happened?

989
01:17:43.894 --> 01:17:47.517
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant
and took 'em to the Acme Factory.

990
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:50.557
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in.

991
01:17:50.598 --> 01:17:53.390
Move over, Rog. You've done
enough drivin' for one night.

992
01:17:55.389 --> 01:17:59.303
Duh, Toontown right on
the other side of the wall, Boss.

993
01:17:59.387 --> 01:18:02.509
You see, Mr, Valiant, the
successful conclusion of this case...

994
01:18:02.592 --> 01:18:06.549
draws the curtains on my career
as a jurist in Toontown.

995
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:10.215
I'm retiring to take a new role
in the private sector.

996
01:18:10.298 --> 01:18:14.003
- That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries, by any chance, eh?
- Uh-uh.

997
01:18:14.087 --> 01:18:17.169
You're looking at the sole stockholder.

998
01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:25.166
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.

999
01:18:25.249 --> 01:18:28.496
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.

1000
01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:31.037
This is no way to make a livin'.

1001
01:18:33.203 --> 01:18:35.827
Wouldn't you know, locked.

1002
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:37.991
Whoa!

1003
01:18:45.697 --> 01:18:48.113
Can you guess what this is?

1004
01:18:50.027 --> 01:18:54.650
Oh, my God, it's Dip!

1005
01:18:54.692 --> 01:18:59.315
That's right, my dear. Enough to Dip
Toontown off the face of the earth!

1006
01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:05.395
Vehicle of my own design.

1007
01:19:05.478 --> 01:19:08.559
Five thousand gallons of heated Dip...

1008
01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:12.850
pumped at enormous velocity
through a pressurized water cannon.

1009
01:19:12.934 --> 01:19:17.389
Toontown will be erased
in a matter of minutes.

1010
01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.719
I suppose you think no one's
going to notice Toontown's disappeared?

1011
01:19:23.803 --> 01:19:26.717
Who's got time to wonder what happened
to some ridiculous talking mice...

1012
01:19:26.801 --> 01:19:30.966
- when you're driving by
at 75 miles an hour?
- What are you talking about?

1013
01:19:31.049 --> 01:19:34.048
- There's no road past Toontown.
- Not yet.

1014
01:19:34.131 --> 01:19:37.544
Several months ago, I had the good
providence to stumble upon...

1015
01:19:37.628 --> 01:19:40.252
this plan of the City Council's,

1016
01:19:40.335 --> 01:19:43.043
a construction plan of epic proportions.

1017
01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:47.540
- They are calling it a freeway.
- "Freeway"?

1018
01:19:47.624 --> 01:19:51.081
What the hell's a freeway?

1019
01:19:51.206 --> 01:19:54.287
Eight lanes of shimmering cement
running from here to Pasadena.

1020
01:19:54.411 --> 01:19:56.494
Smooth, safe, fast.

1021
01:19:56.577 --> 01:19:59.493
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.

1022
01:19:59.534 --> 01:20:03.574
So that's why you killed Acme
and Maroon? For this freeway?

1023
01:20:03.657 --> 01:20:06.822
- I don't get it.
- Of course not. You lack vision.

1024
01:20:06.906 --> 01:20:11.987
I see a place where people
get on and off the freeway.

1025
01:20:12.071 --> 01:20:14.485
On and off, off and on,

1026
01:20:14.526 --> 01:20:17.484
all day, all night!

1027
01:20:17.525 --> 01:20:19.775
Soon, where Toontown once stood, will be...

1028
01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:22.315
a string of gas stations,

1029
01:20:22.398 --> 01:20:24.314
inexpensive motels,

1030
01:20:24.397 --> 01:20:27.811
restaurants that serve
rapidly prepared food,

1031
01:20:27.895 --> 01:20:29.811
tire salons,

1032
01:20:29.895 --> 01:20:32.476
automobile dealerships,

1033
01:20:32.559 --> 01:20:35.975
and wonderful, wonderful billboards...

1034
01:20:36.059 --> 01:20:39.473
reaching as far as the eye can see!

1035
01:20:40.889 --> 01:20:42.930
My God,

1036
01:20:43.013 --> 01:20:46.095
- it'll be beautiful.
- Come on.

1037
01:20:46.179 --> 01:20:50.467
Nobody's gonna drive this lousy freeway when
they can take the Red Car for a nickel.

1038
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:53.216
Oh, they'll drive.
They'll have to.

1039
01:20:53.299 --> 01:20:55.715
You see, I bought the Red Car...

1040
01:20:55.798 --> 01:20:58.714
so I could dismantle it.

1041
01:20:58.796 --> 01:21:01.211
What the...

1042
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:10.333
- Ay, caramba!
- Aah!

1043
01:21:10.458 --> 01:21:12.874
Okay, nobody move.

1044
01:21:12.957 --> 01:21:15.871
All right, weasels, grab some sky,
or I let the Judge have it.

1045
01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:17.871
You heard me.
I said, drop it.

1046
01:21:17.954 --> 01:21:20.368
- Roger, darling!
- Yes, it's me, my dearest.

1047
01:21:20.452 --> 01:21:24.618
I'd love to embrace you, but first I have to
satisfy my sense of moral outrage.

1048
01:21:24.701 --> 01:21:28.531
- Put the gun down, you bucktoothed fool!
- That's it, Doom.

1049
01:21:28.615 --> 01:21:30.947
Gimme another excuse
to pump ya full of lead.

1050
01:21:31.031 --> 01:21:34.321
You thought you could get away
with it, didn't ya? Ha!

1051
01:21:34.446 --> 01:21:38.735
We toons may act idiotic,
but we're not stupid. We demand justice.

1052
01:21:38.777 --> 01:21:42.566
Why, the real meaning of the word
probably hits you like a ton of bricks.

1053
01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:46.898
Roger!

1054
01:21:46.939 --> 01:21:49.228
Roger, say something.

1055
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:51.270
Look, stars!

1056
01:21:51.312 --> 01:21:54.685
Ready when you are, Raou.

1057
01:21:54.769 --> 01:21:59.600
Tie the lovebirds together.

1058
01:22:04.138 --> 01:22:06.512
Put them up on that hook.

1059
01:22:06.596 --> 01:22:08.678
Use that escape-proof toonrope.

1060
01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:11.719
Time to kill the rabbit.

1061
01:22:16.299 --> 01:22:19.214
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.

1062
01:22:19.256 --> 01:22:22.048
- Was I really?
- Better than Goofy.

1063
01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:38.455
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.

1064
01:22:38.538 --> 01:22:42.286
I've loved you more than any woman's
ever loved a rabbit.

1065
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:45.785
It's over, Mr. Valiant.

1066
01:23:01.568 --> 01:23:05.400
- Look out, you fools!
- Not... so... fast.

1067
01:23:05.483 --> 01:23:09.398
One of these days, you idiots
are gonna laugh yourselves to death!

1068
01:23:12.647 --> 01:23:16.394
Shall I "repose" of him right now, Boss?

1069
01:23:16.477 --> 01:23:20.392
Let him watch his toon friends
get Dipped. Then shoot him.

1070
01:23:22.392 --> 01:23:24.808
With pleasure.

1071
01:23:30.304 --> 01:23:33.303
Everything's funny to you, ain't it,
needle-nose?

1072
01:23:33.386 --> 01:23:37.508
You got a problem with that, Valiant?

1073
01:23:37.592 --> 01:23:39.549
No.

1074
01:23:39.591 --> 01:23:44.338
I just, uh, want you to know somethin'
about the guy you're gonna Dip.

1075
01:23:50.252 --> 01:23:53.209
# Now, Roger is his name
Laughter is his game #

1076
01:23:53.334 --> 01:23:55.958
# Come on, you dope
Untie his rope and watch him go insane #

1077
01:24:07.911 --> 01:24:11.075
- He's lost his mind.
- I don't think so.

1078
01:24:15.198 --> 01:24:17.865
#This singin' ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme #

1079
01:24:17.946 --> 01:24:21.153
# If I get stuck...
I'm outta luck, and... #

1080
01:24:21.237 --> 01:24:23.611
#I'm running out of time#

1081
01:24:23.695 --> 01:24:25.609
Thanks.

1082
01:24:40.602 --> 01:24:44.809
Aah!

1083
01:24:50.764 --> 01:24:54.220
Hey, Eddie, keep it up,

1084
01:24:54.345 --> 01:24:57.761
You're killin' 'em! You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!

1085
01:25:05.257 --> 01:25:09.171
# I'm through with takin' falls
I'm bouncin' off the walls #

1086
01:25:09.255 --> 01:25:12.003
#Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the... ##

1087
01:25:12.087 --> 01:25:14.627
- Nose!
- "Nose"?

1088
01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:16.834
That don't rhyme with "walls".

1089
01:25:16.917 --> 01:25:20.832
- No. But this does.

1090
01:25:36.825 --> 01:25:38.906
Yikes! Oh, my goodness!

1091
01:25:40.822 --> 01:25:45.153
- Jeepers, that was close!

1092
01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:53.024
Bye-bye.

1093
01:25:53.108 --> 01:25:55.940
Eddie, hurry!
It's coming back!

1094
01:26:09.849 --> 01:26:12.349
Oh!

1095
01:26:12.432 --> 01:26:15.513
- Oh, no!
- This is it!

1096
01:26:15.596 --> 01:26:17.513
- No!
- This isn't it.

1097
01:26:20.511 --> 01:26:22.884
Whoa!

1098
01:26:33.921 --> 01:26:37.210
#Wicked witchcraft #

1099
01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:40.626
#And although #

1100
01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:46.290
# I know it's strictly taboo #

1101
01:26:47.081 --> 01:26:49.120
#When... ##

1102
01:27:10.944 --> 01:27:13.816
Don't move.

1103
01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:18.689
No! No!

1104
01:27:57.670 --> 01:28:00.628
Yah!

1105
01:28:22.326 --> 01:28:24.033
Oh, no!

1106
01:28:28.863 --> 01:28:32.236
Come on, Eddie!
Quit playin' around!

1107
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.027
- No! Oh! No!
- Yah! P-P-Please!

1108
01:28:39.108 --> 01:28:42.564
I wasn't worried.
Were you?

1109
01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.054
- Eddie, look!
- Look!

1110
01:29:17.714 --> 01:29:20.670
Holy smoke, he's a toon!

1111
01:29:20.712 --> 01:29:23.711
- Surprised?
- Not really.

1112
01:29:23.794 --> 01:29:28.000
That lamebrain freeway idea
could only be cooked up by a toon.

1113
01:29:28.042 --> 01:29:30.999
Not just any toon.

1114
01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:50.530
Remember me, Eddie?

1115
01:29:50.613 --> 01:29:54.320
When I killed your brother, I talked...

1116
01:29:54.362 --> 01:29:57.153
just... like... this!

1117
01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:08.314
Jumpin' jeepers! Oh!

1118
01:30:14.311 --> 01:30:16.976
- Yikes!
- Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

1119
01:30:45.503 --> 01:30:48.253
Huh?

1120
01:31:20.527 --> 01:31:22.484
Good-bye, my darling.
Good-bye!

1121
01:31:27.731 --> 01:31:32.271
Oh! I think I'm gonna faint.

1122
01:31:38.852 --> 01:31:43.432
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1123
01:31:43.558 --> 01:31:47.681
I'm melting!

1124
01:31:51.469 --> 01:31:54.343
I'm melting! Melting!

1125
01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:58.425
Oh, no!

1126
01:32:03.463 --> 01:32:08.461
Eddie, do something!

1127
01:32:08.586 --> 01:32:13.458
Hurry up, Eddie!
Do something!

1128
01:32:45.151 --> 01:32:49.982
Eddie, there's Dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?

1129
01:33:15.803 --> 01:33:18.635
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close save.

1130
01:33:18.718 --> 01:33:21.550
I thought for sure our goose was cooked.

1131
01:33:21.592 --> 01:33:24.132
Oh!

1132
01:33:24.257 --> 01:33:26.714
My hero!

1133
01:33:26.798 --> 01:33:29.296
- Oh, honey-bunny.
- Oh, love-cup.

1134
01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:32.169
Oh, Roger!

1135
01:33:32.252 --> 01:33:35.044
You were a pillar of strength.

1136
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:43.873
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?

1137
01:33:47.412 --> 01:33:49.036
I've been a cab for 37 years,

1138
01:33:49.036 --> 01:33:49.994
I've been a cab for 37 years,

1139
01:33:50.077 --> 01:33:53.076
and I've never seen a mess like this!

1140
01:33:53.117 --> 01:33:55.533
What was that, a rubbermask?

1141
01:33:55.575 --> 01:33:59.365
Yeah, and this is the rope
from the safe that was dropped on Acme.

1142
01:33:59.406 --> 01:34:02.988
I think your lab boys will find
that paint's a perfect match.

1143
01:34:03.071 --> 01:34:05.362
Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.

1144
01:34:05.403 --> 01:34:08.526
And R.K. Maroon and my brother.

1145
01:34:08.568 --> 01:34:12.691
That's what I call one
seriously disturbed toon.

1146
01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.228
Gosh, uh, I wonder who he really was.

1147
01:34:21.312 --> 01:34:25.059
- I tell you one thing, doc.
He weren't no rabbit.
- Or a duck.

1148
01:34:25.142 --> 01:34:27.224
- Or a dog.
- Or a little wooden boy.

1149
01:34:27.308 --> 01:34:30.349
- Or a sheep.
- Or a woodpecker.
- Or a pussy.

1150
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:32.973
What's that? What is that?

1151
01:34:33.056 --> 01:34:37.219
It's ink. That goof Acme squirted me
with some the other night.

1152
01:34:37.303 --> 01:34:40.510
- Why it's comin' out now, I don't know,
- Here's your answer, Eddie.

1153
01:34:40.552 --> 01:34:43.051
Acme Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.

1154
01:34:43.092 --> 01:34:47.174
- Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
- Applesauce!

1155
01:34:47.215 --> 01:34:50.797
If he was such a genius, why didn't he
leave his will where we could find it?

1156
01:34:50.881 --> 01:34:53.921
Without it, we're just waitin'
for another developer's wrecking ball.

1157
01:34:54.045 --> 01:34:56.377
- Roger, that love letter
you wrote to your wife...
- Yeah?

1158
01:34:56.461 --> 01:34:59.168
In the Ink and Paint Club...
why don't you read it to her now?

1159
01:34:59.251 --> 01:35:01.208
Sure, Eddie.

1160
01:35:01.249 --> 01:35:03.373
"Dear Jessica, How do I love thee?

1161
01:35:03.457 --> 01:35:08.288
Let me count the ways.
I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body..."

1162
01:35:08.371 --> 01:35:10.495
- It's the will!
- Keep reading.

1163
01:35:10.537 --> 01:35:13.118
"Do hereby bequeath inperpetuity..

1164
01:35:13.202 --> 01:35:17.867
the property known as Toontown to
those loveable characters, the toons!"

1165
01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:33.776
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty
funny dance you did for the weasels.

1166
01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:36.566
Do you think your days
of bein' a sourpuss are over?

1167
01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:38.565
Only time will tell.

1168
01:35:38.648 --> 01:35:41.230
- Yeah, well, put it there, pal.
- Yeah.

1169
01:35:50.559 --> 01:35:54.515
Don't tell me you lost
your sense of humor already.

1170
01:35:57.681 --> 01:35:59.805
Does this answer your question?

1171
01:36:02.011 --> 01:36:06.009
- Blech! Bleah!

1172
01:36:06.092 --> 01:36:08.383
Come on, Roger, let's go home.

1173
01:36:08.467 --> 01:36:10.466
I'll bake you a carrot cake.

1174
01:36:12.673 --> 01:36:16.337
# Smile, darn ya, smile #

1175
01:36:16.421 --> 01:36:21.085
# You know this old world
is a great world after all #

1176
01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:25.458
- # Smile, darn ya, smile #

1177
01:36:25.541 --> 01:36:30.997
# And right away watch
Lady Luck pay you a call #

1178
01:36:31.038 --> 01:36:35.620
# Things are never
black as they are painted #

1179
01:36:35.704 --> 01:36:39.159
#Time for you and joy to get acquainted ##

1180
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.159
Okay, m-m-move along.

1181
01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.824
T-T-There's nothing else to see.
That's all, folks.

1182
01:36:43.948 --> 01:36:46.448
Hmm. I like the sound of that.

1183
01:36:46.531 --> 01:36:49.320
T-T-T-T-That's all, folks!
