1
00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:52.843
Mommy's going to the
beauty parlor, darling.

2
00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:55.721
But I'm leaving you
with your favourite friend, Roger.

3
00:00:55.804 --> 00:00:58.474
He is going to take
very, very good care of you.

4
00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:02.394
Because if he doesn't,
he's going back to the science lab!

5
00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:05.856
Please, don't worry. Whatever you say.

6
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.568
Yes, ma'am. Aye, aye, sir. Okeydokey.

7
00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:13.030
Why, I'll take care of him
like he was my own brother.

8
00:01:13.113 --> 00:01:15.282
Or my own sister.

9
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.327
Or my brother's sister.
Or my second cousin

10
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.454
-who is twice removed.
-Gobble. Cookie.

11
00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:24.458
Or my ninth cousin, who is nine times
removed from his place outside.

12
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:29.171
Or like my 15th cousin, who is 16 times
removed from my mother's side.

13
00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.590
Or like my 27th cousin,
who is 37 times...

14
00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.550
-Cookie.
-...removed from my father's side.

15
00:01:36.553 --> 00:01:42.059
Like my 17th cousin, who is
156 times removed from any side!

16
00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:55.864
I'll save you, Baby!

17
00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:58.033
Cookie.

18
00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:01.036
Don't burn yourself,
Baby Herman. Whoa!

19
00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:04.456
Whoa!

20
00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:15.301
Who turned out the lights?
It's dark in here.

21
00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:17.845
Don't they pay their electricity?

22
00:02:17.928 --> 00:02:20.848
What's happened?
I'll find you, Baby. Where are you?

23
00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:23.642
-Where are you?
-Cookie.

24
00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:24.727
Where'd you go?

25
00:03:06.977 --> 00:03:08.270
Cookie.

26
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.694
Cookie.

27
00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.242
I'm here, Baby...

28
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:46.642
Cookie.

29
00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:05.494
Cookie.

30
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:14.044
-Cut!
-All right. That's it, guys.

31
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.005
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut!

32
00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.091
What the hell was wrong
with that take?

33
00:04:19.174 --> 00:04:21.301
Nothing with you, Baby Herman.
You were great. You were perfect.

34
00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:25.097
You were better than perfect.
It's Roger! He keeps blowing his lines!

35
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.016
-Roger, what's this?
-A tweeting bird?

36
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.728
"A tweeting bird?" Roger, read
the script. Look what it says!

37
00:04:31.812 --> 00:04:35.107
It says, "Rabbit gets clunked,
rabbit sees stars."

38
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.111
Not birds, stars!
Can we lose the playback, please?

39
00:04:39.194 --> 00:04:40.863
-Roger, you're killing me! Killing me!
-Cut the playback!

40
00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.364
For cryin' out loud, Roger!

41
00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.033
How many times do we have to
do this damn scene?

42
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.245
Raoul, I'll be in my trailer, takin' a nap!

43
00:04:48.328 --> 00:04:49.872
-Whoa!
-Excuse me, toots.

44
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:52.833
My stomach can't take this.
This set is a mess.

45
00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:56.003
Clean this set up! And get him out
of there, or seal him up in it!

46
00:04:56.086 --> 00:04:58.297
-Lose the lights! And say "lunch"!
-Lunch!

47
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.674
-That's lunch. We're on a half.
-Please, Raoul.

48
00:05:00.757 --> 00:05:04.845
I can give you stars! Just drop the
refrigerator on my head one more time!

49
00:05:04.928 --> 00:05:07.139
Roger, I dropped it on your head
23 times already.

50
00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:10.350
-I can take it! Don't worry about me.
-I'm not worried about you.

51
00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:12.686
I'm worried about the refrigerator.

52
00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:16.398
I can give you stars. Look. Look!

53
00:05:16.732 --> 00:05:19.276
Look!

54
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:22.321
Please, Raoul, I can do it, I swear.

55
00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:25.032
Just give me another chance.
Oh, come on, Raoul.

56
00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:26.366
Toons.

57
00:05:26.783 --> 00:05:30.037
Look! Look, Raoul! Look, Raoul!

58
00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:33.957
Come on, Raoul!

59
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.294
Mr Maroon, Mr Valiant's here to...

60
00:05:38.587 --> 00:05:40.005
He'll be right with you.

61
00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:53.143
No, no, no!
Wait until he gets to his feet.

62
00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:55.521
-Then hit him with the boulder.
-Right, R.K.

63
00:05:57.856 --> 00:06:00.901
How much do you know
about show business, Mr Valiant?

64
00:06:00.984 --> 00:06:04.029
Only there's no business like it,
no business I know.

65
00:06:04.112 --> 00:06:06.865
Yeah, and there's no business
more expensive.

66
00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.202
I'm 25 grand over budget on
the latest Baby Herman cartoon.

67
00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:11.703
You saw the rabbit blowin' his lines.

68
00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:13.497
He can't keep his mind on the work.
You know why?

69
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.958
One too many refrigerators
dropped on his head?

70
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.042
Nah, he's a Toon.

71
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:20.045
You can drop anything you want
on his head. He'll shake it off.

72
00:06:20.128 --> 00:06:23.382
But break his heart, he goes to pieces,
just like you or me.

73
00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:24.633
Read that.

74
00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:30.889
"Seen cooing over calamari
with not-so-new sugar daddy,

75
00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:34.851
"was Jessica Rabbit,
wife of Maroon Cartoon star Roger."

76
00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:36.478
What's this got to do with me?

77
00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:38.605
You're the private detective.
You figure it out.

78
00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.566
Look, I don't have time for this.

79
00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:44.236
Look, Valiant, his wife's poison,
but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.

80
00:06:45.487 --> 00:06:46.905
I want you to follow her,

81
00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:50.993
get me a couple of nice, juicy pictures
I can wise the rabbit up with.

82
00:06:51.076 --> 00:06:54.246
-Forget it. I don't work Toontown.
-What's wrong with Toontown?

83
00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:55.581
Every Joe loves Toontown.

84
00:06:55.664 --> 00:06:58.292
Then get Joe to do the job,
'cause I ain't goin'.

85
00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:01.086
Whoa, fella.
You don't want to go to Toontown,

86
00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.088
you don't have to go to Toontown.

87
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:06.174
Nobody said you had to
go to Toontown anyway.

88
00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:09.261
Have a seat, Valiant.

89
00:07:09.344 --> 00:07:12.347
The rabbit's wife sings at a joint
called the Ink and Paint Club.

90
00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:16.643
"Toon Revue."
Strictly humans only, okay?

91
00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.646
So what do you think, Valiant?

92
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.899
Well?

93
00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:31.533
The job's gonna cost you
100 bucks, plus expenses.

94
00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:32.659
A hundred bucks?

95
00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:35.120
-That's ridiculous!
-So's the job.

96
00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:39.124
All right, all right.
You got your 100 bucks.

97
00:07:39.207 --> 00:07:42.628
-Have a drink, Eddie.
-I don't mind if I do.

98
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:44.129
-I got it.
-Careful, Dave.

99
00:07:44.212 --> 00:07:46.173
-I got it!
-Dave, you're gonna drop it!

100
00:07:46.256 --> 00:07:48.884
-I'm not gonna drop it!
-You're droppin' it!

101
00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:51.219
Watch it! Oh, no! Jeez!

102
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.188
Come on!

103
00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:08.195
Kind of jumpy, aren't you, Valiant?

104
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.948
-It's just Dumbo.
-I know who it is.

105
00:08:12.032 --> 00:08:16.828
I got him on loan from Disney,
him and half the cast of <i>Fantasia.</i>

106
00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:20.415
The best part is

107
00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:23.752
they work for peanuts.

108
00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:34.346
Well, I don't work for peanuts.
Where's the other 50?

109
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.059
Let's call the other 50
a carrot to finish the job.

110
00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:42.771
You've been hanging
around rabbits too long.

111
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.223
Oh, excuse me!

112
00:09:39.494 --> 00:09:41.496
Please, help. Oh, I'm sorry.

113
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.498
Get out of my way!

114
00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:49.087
Oh, taxi? Oh, cab?

115
00:09:50.297 --> 00:09:54.259
Right here! Right here!

116
00:09:59.055 --> 00:10:00.515
What do I look like, a bank?

117
00:10:10.358 --> 00:10:11.443
Wait for me!

118
00:10:11.526 --> 00:10:13.236
-Come on!
-Guys, wait up!

119
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.323
-Come on, hurry up! Come on, Sig!
-Hurry up!

120
00:10:16.406 --> 00:10:19.284
-Hey, mister, ain't you got a car?
-Who needs a car in L.A.?

121
00:10:19.367 --> 00:10:21.828
We got the best public
transportation system in the world.

122
00:10:45.894 --> 00:10:47.062
-Hey, so long.
-See you later!

123
00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:48.980
-So long, mister!
-Thanks for the cigarettes.

124
00:10:49.064 --> 00:10:50.398
-You bet.
-Anytime.

125
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.577
-Hi, Harry.
-Hey, Eddie. How's it going?

126
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:03.829
Okay. What you got for me?

127
00:11:03.912 --> 00:11:05.080
The usual bills.

128
00:11:07.165 --> 00:11:09.000
Hey, give back my ball!

129
00:11:14.464 --> 00:11:15.757
Hello, fella.

130
00:11:22.097 --> 00:11:24.057
-Hi, Harry. Are you okay?
-Hey.

131
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.609
What's with Earl?

132
00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:42.200
-Laid off?
-A new outfit bought the Red Car.

133
00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:44.369
Some big company called Cloverleaf.

134
00:11:44.452 --> 00:11:46.621
No kiddin'. They bought the Red Car?

135
00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:50.750
Yeah, and put the poor guy on
two weeks' notice. Cutbacks, they said.

136
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.507
Oh, well.

137
00:11:57.591 --> 00:12:01.803
Here's to the pencil pushers.
May they all get lead poisoning, huh?

138
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:10.312
Tomorrow's Friday, Eddie. You know
what happens here on Friday?

139
00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:13.773
-Fish special?
-My boss checks the books on Friday.

140
00:12:13.857 --> 00:12:16.234
And if I don't have that money
I gave you back in the till,

141
00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:17.611
I'm gonna lose my job.

142
00:12:17.694 --> 00:12:20.780
Don't bust a button, Dolores.
You've only got one left.

143
00:12:21.865 --> 00:12:23.116
50 bucks?

144
00:12:24.451 --> 00:12:25.577
Where's the rest?

145
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.830
Well, it's only a snoop job away.

146
00:12:29.497 --> 00:12:32.208
You got that camera of yours?
Mine's in the shop.

147
00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:34.252
Wouldn't be the pawn shop
by any chance, would it?

148
00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:35.837
Oh, come on, Dolores.

149
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.173
You need the other 50.
I need the camera.

150
00:12:42.177 --> 00:12:44.137
Any film in there?

151
00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:47.641
Should be.

152
00:12:47.724 --> 00:12:50.769
I haven't had that roll
developed since our trip to Catalina.

153
00:12:50.852 --> 00:12:54.648
-That sure was a long time ago.
-Yeah, that was a long time ago.

154
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:58.151
-Let's do that again sometime.
-Yeah, sure, Eddie.

155
00:13:04.032 --> 00:13:07.744
-That paper even good?
-Just check the scrawl.

156
00:13:07.827 --> 00:13:10.080
R.K. Maroon, as in Maroon Cartoons?

157
00:13:10.163 --> 00:13:11.790
Maroon Cartoons?

158
00:13:12.874 --> 00:13:17.545
Hey. So who's your client,
Mr Detective-To-The-Stars?

159
00:13:18.713 --> 00:13:22.300
Chilly Willy? Or Screwy Squirrel?

160
00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:25.303
-What do you want to drink?
-I'll take a beer, doll.

161
00:13:25.387 --> 00:13:28.890
So what happened, huh?
Somebody kidnap Dinky Doodle?

162
00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:30.725
Cut it out, Angelo.

163
00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:32.769
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. I know.

164
00:13:32.852 --> 00:13:34.562
You're working for Little Bo Peep.

165
00:13:34.646 --> 00:13:37.691
She's lost her sheep and
you're gonna help her find them.

166
00:13:37.774 --> 00:13:38.984
Hey?

167
00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:44.864
Get this straight, meatball.

168
00:13:44.948 --> 00:13:48.243
I don't work for Toons!

169
00:13:54.916 --> 00:13:56.501
So what's his problem?

170
00:13:59.295 --> 00:14:01.423
-A Toon killed his brother.
-What?

171
00:14:03.758 --> 00:14:05.427
Dropped a piano on his head.

172
00:14:17.939 --> 00:14:20.316
Got the password?

173
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.318
Walt sent me.

174
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:39.919
-Nice monkey suit.
-Wiseass.

175
00:15:08.531 --> 00:15:09.908
All right.

176
00:15:09.991 --> 00:15:11.951
Hey, look at that!

177
00:15:13.578 --> 00:15:15.580
Hey! Hey! Cut it out!

178
00:15:15.663 --> 00:15:18.291
Does anybody understand
what this duck is saying?

179
00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:26.549
-Most amusing.
-A little more wine.

180
00:15:28.134 --> 00:15:32.639
I've worked with a lot of wise quackers,
but you are despicable.

181
00:15:32.722 --> 00:15:34.933
Doggone stubborn nitwit!

182
00:15:35.016 --> 00:15:36.768
That did it!

183
00:15:36.851 --> 00:15:40.146
This is the last time I work with
someone with a speech impediment.

184
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.481
Oh, yeah?

185
00:15:42.857 --> 00:15:45.860
-Whoa!
-This means war.

186
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:59.332
-What, you think that's funny?
-Oh, it's a panic.

187
00:15:59.415 --> 00:16:02.210
You won't think it's funny
when I stick that pen up your nose.

188
00:16:02.293 --> 00:16:06.548
Now, calm down, son, will ya? Look,
the stain's gone. It's disappearing ink.

189
00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:08.216
No hard feelings, I hope.

190
00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:10.718
-Look, I'm... I'm...
-I know who you are.

191
00:16:10.802 --> 00:16:13.763
Marvin Acme, the guy that
owns Toontown. The gag king.

192
00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:16.641
If it's Acme, it's a gasser.

193
00:16:16.724 --> 00:16:18.143
Put it there, pal.

194
00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:23.565
The hand buzzer.
It's still our biggest seller.

195
00:16:30.238 --> 00:16:31.948
Scotch on the rocks.

196
00:16:32.699 --> 00:16:34.200
And I mean ice!

197
00:16:40.373 --> 00:16:41.749
This is hot stuff!

198
00:16:47.463 --> 00:16:48.798
Wow!

199
00:17:20.121 --> 00:17:23.750
Hey, those ducks are funny.
They never get to finish the act!

200
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:27.587
Great. Thanks.

201
00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:35.553
-Toons.
-Cigars? Cigarettes?

202
00:17:35.637 --> 00:17:39.057
-Eddie Valiant!
-Betty?

203
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.267
Long time no see.

204
00:17:41.476 --> 00:17:42.644
What are you doing here?

205
00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:46.397
Work's been kinda slow
since cartoons went to color.

206
00:17:46.481 --> 00:17:50.151
But I still got it, Eddie.
Boop-boop-be-doop.

207
00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:52.946
Yeah, you still got it.

208
00:18:00.995 --> 00:18:01.996
What's with him?

209
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.667
Mr Acme never misses a night
when Jessica performs.

210
00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:07.502
Got a thing for rabbits, huh?

211
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:20.265
<i>You had plenty money</i>

212
00:18:20.348 --> 00:18:24.894
<i>In 1922</i>

213
00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:27.939
<i>You let other women</i>

214
00:18:28.022 --> 00:18:31.442
<i>Make a fool of you</i>

215
00:18:31.526 --> 00:18:35.071
<i>Why don't you do right</i>

216
00:18:37.365 --> 00:18:43.037
<i>Like some other men do?</i>

217
00:18:48.209 --> 00:18:52.005
<i>Get out of here</i>

218
00:18:52.088 --> 00:18:53.214
<i>Give me some money too</i>

219
00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:55.383
She's married to Roger Rabbit?

220
00:18:55.466 --> 00:18:59.387
Yeah. What a lucky girl.

221
00:19:02.056 --> 00:19:05.143
<i>Now if you had prepared</i>

222
00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:09.397
<i>20 years ago</i>

223
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.942
<i>You wouldn't be wanderin' now</i>

224
00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:15.486
<i>From door to door</i>

225
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:20.074
<i>Why don't you do right</i>

226
00:19:21.492 --> 00:19:27.999
<i>Like some other men do?</i>

227
00:19:32.295 --> 00:19:35.840
<i>Get out of here</i>

228
00:19:35.923 --> 00:19:41.054
<i>Give me some money too</i>

229
00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:50.396
<i>Get out of here</i>

230
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.443
<i>Give me some money too</i>

231
00:19:59.572 --> 00:20:05.244
<i>Why don't you do right</i>

232
00:20:05.828 --> 00:20:10.625
<i>Like some other men</i>

233
00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:18.674
<i>Do?</i>

234
00:20:45.993 --> 00:20:48.037
Who is it?

235
00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:51.666
Jessica, dear, have no fear.
Your Marvin is here.

236
00:20:53.042 --> 00:20:55.586
You sure murdered 'em
again tonight, baby.

237
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.465
I really mean it.
My darling, you were superb.

238
00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:04.929
You absolutely, truly and honestly
"fashmolyed" that audience.

239
00:21:05.012 --> 00:21:07.515
You killed them. You slayed them.

240
00:21:07.598 --> 00:21:10.935
You belted them into little pieces.

241
00:21:12.895 --> 00:21:15.148
What do you think
you're doin', chump?

242
00:21:15.231 --> 00:21:17.275
Who are you callin' a chump, chimp?

243
00:21:25.658 --> 00:21:29.287
And don't let me catch your
peepin' face around here again!

244
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.747
Got it?

245
00:21:53.102 --> 00:21:55.313
Come, my dear Jessica.
Come over here.

246
00:21:55.396 --> 00:21:59.233
I got everything arranged,
right here on the bed.

247
00:21:59.567 --> 00:22:02.820
Oh, not tonight, Marvin.
I have a headache.

248
00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:05.948
Oh, Jessica, you promised.

249
00:22:06.032 --> 00:22:07.992
Oh, all right.

250
00:22:08.075 --> 00:22:10.870
But this time, take off that hand buzzer.

251
00:22:13.664 --> 00:22:14.999
Patty-cake.

252
00:22:16.209 --> 00:22:17.877
Patty-cake.

253
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.838
-Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
-Marvin.

254
00:22:20.922 --> 00:22:22.715
-Marvin!
-Patty-cake.

255
00:22:22.798 --> 00:22:24.383
-Marvin.
-Patty-cake.

256
00:22:24.467 --> 00:22:27.386
-Patty-cake. Patty-cake.
-Oh, Marvin!

257
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.514
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

258
00:22:29.597 --> 00:22:31.516
-You gotta be kidding me.
-Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

259
00:22:31.766 --> 00:22:34.519
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

260
00:22:34.602 --> 00:22:37.480
I don't believe it!

261
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.735
Patty-cake! Patty-cake!

262
00:22:42.818 --> 00:22:44.862
Is that true?

263
00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:46.030
Take comfort, son.

264
00:22:46.113 --> 00:22:48.908
You're not the first man whose wife
played patty-cake on him.

265
00:22:56.207 --> 00:22:58.125
I just don't believe it.

266
00:22:58.834 --> 00:23:01.420
I won't believe it. I can't believe it.

267
00:23:01.504 --> 00:23:04.924
-I shan't believe it.
-Believe it, kid.

268
00:23:05.007 --> 00:23:08.427
I took the pictures myself.
She played patty-cake.

269
00:23:08.511 --> 00:23:12.181
No, not my Jessica. Not patty-cake.

270
00:23:12.265 --> 00:23:15.309
This is impossible.
I don't believe it. It can't be!

271
00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:17.979
It just can't be! Jessica's my wife!

272
00:23:18.062 --> 00:23:20.773
It's absolutely impossible!

273
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.775
Jessica's the light of my life,

274
00:23:22.858 --> 00:23:26.112
the apple of my eye,
the cream in my coffee!

275
00:23:26.195 --> 00:23:29.323
You better start drinking it black,
'cause Acme's taking the cream now.

276
00:23:29.407 --> 00:23:33.202
Hard to believe. Marvin Acme's been
my friend and neighbour for 30 years.

277
00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:35.204
Who would've thought
he was a sugar daddy?

278
00:23:35.288 --> 00:23:37.873
Somebody must have made her do it!

279
00:23:37.957 --> 00:23:40.626
Now drink this, son.
It'll make you feel better.

280
00:24:12.992 --> 00:24:15.453
Thanks. I needed that.

281
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.000
Son of a bitch.

282
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.462
Look, Mr Maroon.

283
00:24:26.047 --> 00:24:28.257
I think my work here is finished.

284
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:30.426
How about that carrot
you owe me, huh?

285
00:24:30.509 --> 00:24:33.137
-A deal's a deal.
-Great.

286
00:24:33.346 --> 00:24:35.431
Thanks.

287
00:24:36.849 --> 00:24:41.062
Roger, I know all this
seems pretty painful now,

288
00:24:41.145 --> 00:24:43.522
but you'll find someone new.

289
00:24:43.606 --> 00:24:46.400
-Won't he, Mr Valiant?
-Yeah, sure.

290
00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:48.986
Good-looking guy like that.

291
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.821
The dames will be
breaking his door down.

292
00:24:50.905 --> 00:24:52.323
Dames? What dames?

293
00:24:52.406 --> 00:24:53.658
Jessica is the only one for me!

294
00:24:53.741 --> 00:24:56.327
You'll see! We'll rise above
this piddling peccadillo!

295
00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:57.411
We're going to be happy again!

296
00:24:57.495 --> 00:25:00.414
You got that? Happy.
Capital H-A-P-P-I...

297
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.799
Well, at least he took it well.

298
00:25:19.975 --> 00:25:21.936
Oh, Jessica!

299
00:25:22.436 --> 00:25:25.898
Please tell me it's not true.

300
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:31.779
Please!

301
00:27:53.045 --> 00:27:54.839
Lieutenant Santino.

302
00:27:56.507 --> 00:27:58.092
Where'd you come from?

303
00:27:59.426 --> 00:28:02.888
Gee whiz, Eddie. If you needed money
so bad, why didn't you come to me?

304
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:06.517
So I took a couple of
dirty pictures. So kill me.

305
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.186
I already got a stiff
on my hands, thank you.

306
00:28:10.312 --> 00:28:11.856
Marvin Acme.

307
00:28:12.731 --> 00:28:14.525
The rabbit cacked him last night.

308
00:28:15.234 --> 00:28:16.235
What?

309
00:28:26.954 --> 00:28:28.289
Now what?

310
00:28:29.456 --> 00:28:32.084
It's just I haven't been this close
to Toontown for a while.

311
00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:41.510
My biscuits are burnin'!
Fire in the hatch!

312
00:28:42.553 --> 00:28:44.638
Great horny toads, that smarts!

313
00:28:50.477 --> 00:28:52.688
Come on, Eddie.
Let's get this over with.

314
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:55.566
I didn't see anything.

315
00:28:55.649 --> 00:28:57.818
Maybe you heard a noise or something.

316
00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.820
-He's with me.
-Nothin'.

317
00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:02.781
-Are you sure?
-Come on, kid.

318
00:29:02.865 --> 00:29:04.450
Are you sure you didn't see anything?

319
00:29:04.533 --> 00:29:07.244
-What about you, fella?
-I didn't see anything.

320
00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:09.413
-I came in to work.
-Come on, Lieutenant.

321
00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:13.208
Just like a Toon to drop
a safe on a guy's head.

322
00:29:13.292 --> 00:29:14.710
Sorry, Eddie.

323
00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:17.421
You better wait here, all right?

324
00:29:17.504 --> 00:29:19.173
You got a positive I.D.?

325
00:29:24.053 --> 00:29:26.013
Must be.

326
00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:32.394
Hey, Chisold, get a load of this.

327
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.314
You've seen one of these?

328
00:29:39.276 --> 00:29:41.278
-Yeah.
-Hey, guys.

329
00:29:52.414 --> 00:29:54.750
Didn't you used to be Eddie Valiant?

330
00:29:56.043 --> 00:29:59.046
Or did you change your name
to Jack Daniels?

331
00:30:06.637 --> 00:30:09.473
-What's that?
-Paint from the rabbit's glove.

332
00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:12.559
Mr Valiant?

333
00:30:16.063 --> 00:30:18.357
I hope you're proud of yourself

334
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.401
and those pictures you took.

335
00:30:27.908 --> 00:30:30.369
For crying out loud, Mike!
Hey, we need a little help over here!

336
00:30:30.452 --> 00:30:32.162
Hey, somebody grab those loafers!

337
00:30:34.373 --> 00:30:35.874
Hey, Mike, come here!

338
00:30:40.254 --> 00:30:42.756
I got these. Come on. Come on.
Those shoes over there.

339
00:31:02.234 --> 00:31:05.195
Is this man removing evidence
from the scene of a crime?

340
00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:08.615
No, Judge Doom. Valiant here
was just pickin' it up for you.

341
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:10.743
Weren't you, Eddie?

342
00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.829
-Hand it over.
-Sure.

343
00:31:17.332 --> 00:31:18.792
His number-one seller.

344
00:31:20.961 --> 00:31:24.006
I see working for a Toon
has rubbed off on you.

345
00:31:24.089 --> 00:31:27.760
I wasn't working for a Toon.
I was working for R.K. Maroon.

346
00:31:27.843 --> 00:31:30.095
Yes, we talked to Mr Maroon.

347
00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:32.389
He told us the rabbit
became quite agitated

348
00:31:32.473 --> 00:31:33.974
when you showed him the pictures.

349
00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:38.437
The rabbit said, one way or another,
he and his wife were going to be happy.

350
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.980
Is that true?

351
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:42.399
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

352
00:31:42.483 --> 00:31:44.735
Shut your yap, Eddie.
The man's in charge.

353
00:31:44.818 --> 00:31:47.488
That's all right, Lieutenant.
From the smell of him,

354
00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:49.865
I'd say it was the booze talking.

355
00:31:50.866 --> 00:31:54.787
No matter. The rabbit won't get far.
My men will find him.

356
00:31:56.371 --> 00:31:58.415
Look out!

357
00:32:02.628 --> 00:32:03.754
-Weasels?
-Yes.

358
00:32:03.837 --> 00:32:05.923
I find they have
a special gift for the work.

359
00:32:06.006 --> 00:32:09.093
All right, ya mugs. Fall out.

360
00:32:09.176 --> 00:32:11.887
-Did you find the rabbit?
-Don't worry, Judge.

361
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:16.517
We've got "deformants”
all over the city. We'll find him.

362
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.521
You wouldn't have any idea where
the rabbit might be, Mr Valiant?

363
00:32:22.523 --> 00:32:25.484
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Cucamonga?

364
00:32:25.567 --> 00:32:28.362
I hear Kokomo's very nice
this time of the year.

365
00:32:28.445 --> 00:32:30.948
I'm surprised you're not
more cooperative, Mr Valiant.

366
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:32.699
A human has been
murdered by a Toon.

367
00:32:32.783 --> 00:32:35.160
Don't you appreciate
the magnitude of that?

368
00:32:40.707 --> 00:32:43.877
Since I've had Toontown
under my jurisdiction,

369
00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:47.631
my goal has been
to reign in the insanity.

370
00:32:47.714 --> 00:32:51.927
And the only way to do that is
to make Toons respect the law.

371
00:33:05.524 --> 00:33:08.360
How did that gargoyle
get to be a judge?

372
00:33:08.443 --> 00:33:11.822
He spread a bunch of simoleons
around Toontown a couple years back,

373
00:33:11.905 --> 00:33:13.574
bought the election.

374
00:33:13.657 --> 00:33:14.825
Yeah? What's that?

375
00:33:17.411 --> 00:33:20.164
Remember how we always thought
there wasn't a way to kill a Toon?

376
00:33:20.247 --> 00:33:21.999
-Yeah.
-Well, Doom found a way.

377
00:33:22.082 --> 00:33:24.626
Turpentine, acetone, benzene.

378
00:33:24.918 --> 00:33:28.505
-He calls it "the dip."
-I'll catch the rabbit, Mr Valiant.

379
00:33:28.589 --> 00:33:31.383
Then I'll try him, convict him

380
00:33:31.466 --> 00:33:33.886
and execute him.

381
00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:45.272
Gee.

382
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.531
That's one dead shoe, eh, boss?

383
00:33:54.615 --> 00:33:58.076
They're not kid gloves, Mr Valiant.

384
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.206
But this is how we handle things
down in Toontown.

385
00:34:02.289 --> 00:34:04.958
I'd think you, of all people,
would appreciate that.

386
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:25.854
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, hey!

387
00:34:28.899 --> 00:34:31.944
I've been tr yin' to make him quit,
but he just won't listen to me.

388
00:34:32.027 --> 00:34:35.030
What do you know, you dumb broad?
You got the I.Q. of a rattle.

389
00:34:35.113 --> 00:34:36.782
-You Valiant?
-Yeah.

390
00:34:36.865 --> 00:34:40.744
I wanna talk to you about
the Acme murder. Hey, doll.

391
00:34:40.827 --> 00:34:42.955
Why don't you run downstairs
and get me a racin' form?

392
00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:46.541
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

393
00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:48.835
The lady's man, huh?

394
00:34:48.919 --> 00:34:52.256
My problem is I got a 50-year-old lust
in a 3-year-old dinky.

395
00:34:52.339 --> 00:34:53.799
Yeah, must be tough.

396
00:34:53.882 --> 00:34:56.718
Look, Valiant,
the rabbit didn't kill Acme.

397
00:34:56.802 --> 00:34:59.805
He's not a murderer. I should know.
He's a dear friend of mine.

398
00:34:59.888 --> 00:35:03.350
I tell ya, Valiant, the whole thing
stinks like yesterday's diapers.

399
00:35:03.433 --> 00:35:06.853
Look at this.
The paper said Acme left no will.

400
00:35:06.937 --> 00:35:10.607
That's a load of succotash.
Every Toon knows Acme had a will.

401
00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:12.985
He promised to leave Toontown
to us Toons.

402
00:35:13.068 --> 00:35:15.529
That will is the reason
he got bumped off.

403
00:35:15.612 --> 00:35:17.114
Has anybody ever seen this will?

404
00:35:17.197 --> 00:35:19.908
No, but he gave us his solemn oath.

405
00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:24.955
If you believe that that joker could do
anything solemn, the gag's on you, pal.

406
00:35:25.038 --> 00:35:28.583
I just figured since you were the one
who got my pal in trouble,

407
00:35:28.667 --> 00:35:30.836
you might want to help get him out.

408
00:35:30.919 --> 00:35:32.504
I can pay you.

409
00:35:33.588 --> 00:35:35.966
Save your money for a pair
of elevator shoes!

410
00:35:36.049 --> 00:35:39.553
Wait, no! Valiant, no! Oh, my stogie!

411
00:35:54.735 --> 00:35:57.654
It ain't my fault the rabbit
got himself in trouble.

412
00:36:01.575 --> 00:36:04.745
All I did was take
a couple of lousy pictures.

413
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:27.559
Baby was right.

414
00:36:38.862 --> 00:36:39.946
The hell with it.

415
00:37:10.727 --> 00:37:13.188
-How the hell did you get in here?
-Through the mail slot.

416
00:37:13.271 --> 00:37:15.399
I thought it would be best
if I waited inside,

417
00:37:15.482 --> 00:37:17.234
seein' as how I'm wanted for murder!

418
00:37:17.317 --> 00:37:20.737
No kiddin'. Just talkin' to you could
get me a rap for aiding and abetting.

419
00:37:20.821 --> 00:37:23.824
Wait a minute.
Anybody know you're here?

420
00:37:23.907 --> 00:37:26.451
Nobody. Not a soul except...

421
00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:29.621
-Who?
-Well, you see...

422
00:37:29.704 --> 00:37:32.457
I didn't know where your office was,
so I asked the newsboy.

423
00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:35.210
He didn't know, so I asked
the fireman, the green grocer,

424
00:37:35.293 --> 00:37:37.379
the butcher, the baker.
They didn't know.

425
00:37:37.462 --> 00:37:39.297
But the liquor store guy, he knew.

426
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:41.842
In other words, the whole
damn town knows you're here!

427
00:37:41.925 --> 00:37:43.802
-Get out of here! Come on. Out!
-Hey, take it easy, will ya?

428
00:37:43.885 --> 00:37:45.595
-Out! Get out! Come on.
-Please, Eddie, don't throw me out!

429
00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:46.930
-You're making a big mistake!
-Get out of here!

430
00:37:47.013 --> 00:37:49.266
-I didn't kill anybody! I swear!
-Let go of that door, will ya?

431
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:52.144
This whole thing's a setup,
a scam, a frame job.

432
00:37:52.978 --> 00:37:54.771
Eddie, I could never hurt anybody.

433
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.816
My whole purpose in life

434
00:37:57.899 --> 00:38:01.194
is to make people

435
00:38:02.612 --> 00:38:04.281
laugh!

436
00:38:06.158 --> 00:38:07.868
Okay, okay. Sure, I admit it.

437
00:38:07.993 --> 00:38:11.037
I got a little steamed when you
showed me those pictures of Jessica,

438
00:38:11.121 --> 00:38:14.749
so I rushed over
to the Ink and Paint Club.

439
00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:19.045
But she wasn't in her dressing room,
so I wrote her a love letter.

440
00:38:19.212 --> 00:38:20.714
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

441
00:38:21.548 --> 00:38:25.635
You're telling me, in a fit of jealousy,
you wrote your wife a love letter?

442
00:38:25.719 --> 00:38:30.640
That's right. I know that she was
just an innocent victim of circumstance.

443
00:38:30.724 --> 00:38:33.226
I suppose you used the old lipstick
on the mirror routine, huh?

444
00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.395
Lipstick, yes. Mirror, no.

445
00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:38.273
I found a nice, clean piece of paper.

446
00:38:38.356 --> 00:38:43.445
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.

447
00:38:43.528 --> 00:38:47.449
"One-one thousand, two-one thousand,
three-one thousand..."

448
00:38:47.532 --> 00:38:49.618
Why didn't you just leave
the letter there?

449
00:38:49.701 --> 00:38:53.330
Obviously, a poem of this power
and sensitivity must

450
00:38:54.623 --> 00:38:57.751
be read in person,
so I went home to wait for her.

451
00:38:57.959 --> 00:39:00.504
But the weasels were there,
waiting for me.

452
00:39:00.587 --> 00:39:02.631
So... So I ran.

453
00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:06.927
So why come to me? I'm the guy
that took the pictures of your wife.

454
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.222
Yeah, and you're also the guy
that helped all these Toons.

455
00:39:10.305 --> 00:39:12.849
Everybody knows,
when a Toon's in trouble,

456
00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:16.186
there's only one place to go,
Valiant and Valiant.

457
00:39:16.269 --> 00:39:18.021
Not any more.

458
00:39:18.939 --> 00:39:20.565
Get out of that chair!

459
00:39:23.944 --> 00:39:27.113
-That's my brother's chair.
-Yeah. Where is your brother anyway?

460
00:39:27.197 --> 00:39:30.617
He looks like a sensitive
and sober fellow.

461
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.788
-That's it. I'm callin' the cops.
-Go ahead. Call the cops.

462
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:37.374
I come here for help,
and what do you do?

463
00:39:37.457 --> 00:39:40.961
You turn me in.
No, no, don't feel guilty about me.

464
00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:44.506
So long, and thanks for nothin'.

465
00:39:46.633 --> 00:39:49.427
That's the closet! Stupe.

466
00:40:02.274 --> 00:40:05.235
Eddie Valiant, you're under arrest.

467
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.862
Get out!

468
00:40:08.488 --> 00:40:12.242
Idiot. I got no keys for these cuffs.

469
00:40:21.376 --> 00:40:24.462
Come on. Get the lead out.
Move it, would ya? Move it!

470
00:40:27.549 --> 00:40:30.218
It's the Toon Patrol!

471
00:40:33.388 --> 00:40:35.599
Hide me, Eddie. Please!

472
00:40:37.851 --> 00:40:40.812
-Remember. You never saw me.
-Get out of there!

473
00:40:41.688 --> 00:40:44.024
Don't let 'em find me!

474
00:40:44.649 --> 00:40:47.319
Come on, Eddie. You're my only hope.

475
00:40:48.528 --> 00:40:50.614
Open up in the name of the law!

476
00:40:50.697 --> 00:40:51.948
-That's us.
-Please, Eddie.

477
00:40:52.032 --> 00:40:54.492
You know there's no justice
for Toons any more.

478
00:40:54.576 --> 00:40:58.288
-If the weasels get their hands on me...
-Are you in there?

479
00:40:58.371 --> 00:41:02.459
-I'm as good as dipped.
-Don't make us play rough, Valiant.

480
00:41:02.542 --> 00:41:04.794
We just want the rabbit.

481
00:41:04.878 --> 00:41:07.631
What are we gonna do, Eddie?
What are we gonna do?

482
00:41:07.714 --> 00:41:09.841
What are we gonna do?

483
00:41:09.924 --> 00:41:12.594
What's all this "we" stuff?
They just want the rabbit.

484
00:41:24.147 --> 00:41:26.399
It looks like they gave us
the slip, huh, boss?

485
00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:29.694
Nah. Valiant's got him
stashed somewhere.

486
00:41:32.113 --> 00:41:34.407
Hold it right there.

487
00:41:36.326 --> 00:41:39.120
Hello, boys. I didn't hear you come in.

488
00:41:40.872 --> 00:41:43.875
Okay, wise guy. Where's the rabbit?

489
00:41:43.958 --> 00:41:45.543
I haven't seen him.

490
00:41:46.836 --> 00:41:49.381
-What's in there?
-My lingerie.

491
00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.050
Sheesh, Valiant.

492
00:41:57.847 --> 00:41:59.432
Search the place, boys.

493
00:42:00.225 --> 00:42:02.143
And leave no stone unturned.

494
00:42:03.353 --> 00:42:07.315
Look, Valiant, we got a reliable
tip-off the rabbit was here,

495
00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:10.110
and it was "corrugated"
by several others.

496
00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:13.321
So cut the "bullshtick."

497
00:42:13.905 --> 00:42:18.159
You keep talkin' like that, and
I'm gonna have to wash your mouth out.

498
00:42:29.629 --> 00:42:31.840
Stop that laughin'!

499
00:42:35.635 --> 00:42:37.887
Stop that laughin'!

500
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:42.267
You know what happens
when ya can't stop laughin'!

501
00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:48.982
One of these days,
you're gonna die laughin'.

502
00:42:51.443 --> 00:42:54.112
As for you, Valiant, step out of line,

503
00:42:54.195 --> 00:42:57.073
and we'll hang you and your laundry

504
00:42:57.157 --> 00:42:59.075
out to dry.

505
00:43:03.121 --> 00:43:05.290
Come on, boys. Let's "am-scray."

506
00:43:08.376 --> 00:43:11.337
-They're gone.
-Jeepers, Eddie, that was swell.

507
00:43:11.421 --> 00:43:15.049
You saved my life.
How can I ever repay ya?

508
00:43:18.178 --> 00:43:21.598
For starters, don't ever kiss me again!

509
00:43:24.726 --> 00:43:27.771
Stop kicking me. Stop kicking me.

510
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.734
Dolores. Dolores!

511
00:43:32.817 --> 00:43:34.736
Dolores!

512
00:43:39.699 --> 00:43:41.993
Hey, Eddie, you made
the front page today.

513
00:43:42.076 --> 00:43:45.246
-Yeah, I guess I made some ink.
-And what ink.

514
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.541
Come on, Eddie. Just let's go. Please!

515
00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:54.756
So tell me, Eddie.
Is that a rabbit in your pocket,

516
00:43:54.839 --> 00:43:56.674
or are you just happy to see me?

517
00:43:58.259 --> 00:44:00.887
Cut the comedy, Dolores.
I've had a very hard day.

518
00:44:01.721 --> 00:44:04.349
-I gotta get out of these cuffs.
-Oh, swell.

519
00:44:06.559 --> 00:44:10.563
Jeepers, Eddie, that almost killed me!

520
00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:13.483
Boy, what is this?
Some kind of a secret room?

521
00:44:13.566 --> 00:44:16.110
It's a rotgut room.
A holdover from Prohibition.

522
00:44:16.194 --> 00:44:19.739
Oh, I get it. A speakeasy,
a gin mill, a hooch parlor.

523
00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:23.701
-Tools are up here, Eddie.
-Look at this! It's a spy hole!

524
00:44:23.785 --> 00:44:26.454
Jeepers, Eddie!
This would be a great place to hide!

525
00:44:28.706 --> 00:44:31.334
-Crazy Toon.
-Watch your head!

526
00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:35.505
I thought you said
you'd never take another Toon case.

527
00:44:35.588 --> 00:44:38.091
-What'd you have, a change of heart?
-Nothing's changed.

528
00:44:38.174 --> 00:44:41.219
Somebody's made a patsy out of me,
and I'm going to find out why.

529
00:44:49.352 --> 00:44:50.770
Hold still, will ya?

530
00:44:53.398 --> 00:44:56.109
-Does this help?
-Yeah. Thanks.

531
00:45:00.363 --> 00:45:01.364
You mean to tell me that

532
00:45:01.447 --> 00:45:03.783
you could have taken your hand
out of that cuff at any time?

533
00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:07.036
No, not at any time.
Only when it was funny.

534
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.454
Get out!

535
00:45:08.538 --> 00:45:11.416
Come on, Eddie.
Where's your sense of humor?

536
00:45:11.499 --> 00:45:14.085
He always this funny, or only on days
when he's wanted for murder?

537
00:45:14.168 --> 00:45:16.212
Listen, my philosophy is this.

538
00:45:16.296 --> 00:45:19.465
If you don't have a good sense
of humor, you're better off dead.

539
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:23.261
You just may get your wish unless
I can figure out what happened to this.

540
00:45:23.344 --> 00:45:25.930
-What is it, Eddie?
-Just look at it.

541
00:45:26.014 --> 00:45:28.892
-Mr Acme's will.
-Yeah.

542
00:45:28.975 --> 00:45:31.060
And I think Maroon
played the part of sound mind

543
00:45:31.144 --> 00:45:32.562
and your wife the sound body.

544
00:45:32.645 --> 00:45:34.814
Why, I resent that innuendo!

545
00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:37.692
-What's the scheme, Eddie?
-I don't think they got to the will.

546
00:45:38.651 --> 00:45:39.611
But how do you know?

547
00:45:39.694 --> 00:45:42.280
Because they were still looking
for it after they killed him.

548
00:45:42.363 --> 00:45:43.656
Anything I can do?

549
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.783
Maybe you can go downtown
and check the probate.

550
00:45:45.867 --> 00:45:48.202
Yeah, check the probate!

551
00:45:48.286 --> 00:45:51.581
Why, my Uncle Thumper
had a problem with his probate,

552
00:45:51.664 --> 00:45:55.793
and he had to take these big pills
and drink lots of water.

553
00:45:55.877 --> 00:46:00.423
-Not prostate, you idiot. Probate!
-Let me get this straight.

554
00:46:00.506 --> 00:46:03.176
You think that my boss, R.K. Maroon

555
00:46:03.259 --> 00:46:05.803
dropped a safe on Marvin Acme's head

556
00:46:05.887 --> 00:46:08.306
so that he could get
his hands on Toontown?

557
00:46:08.389 --> 00:46:10.266
Yeah.

558
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.768
That's my hunch.

559
00:46:14.479 --> 00:46:16.481
Can he stay here for a couple of days?

560
00:46:18.024 --> 00:46:19.859
He's not gonna do
anything crazy, is he?

561
00:46:26.407 --> 00:46:28.493
-Where are you going?
-Back to the office.

562
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:34.415
Mr Valiant. Mr Valiant?

563
00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:43.466
You've got the wrong idea
about me, Mr Valiant.

564
00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:46.177
I'm a pawn in this, just like Roger.

565
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:51.474
Can you help me find him?
Just name your price and I'll pay it.

566
00:46:51.557 --> 00:46:53.393
Yeah, I bet you would.

567
00:46:54.727 --> 00:46:57.105
You've gotta have the rabbit
to make the scam work.

568
00:46:57.188 --> 00:47:01.109
No, no, no. I love my husband.
You've got me all wrong.

569
00:47:01.192 --> 00:47:04.612
You don't know how hard it is
being a woman

570
00:47:04.696 --> 00:47:06.698
looking the way I do.

571
00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.574
Yeah, well.

572
00:47:09.617 --> 00:47:12.245
You don't know how hard
it is being a man

573
00:47:12.912 --> 00:47:15.498
looking at a woman,
looking the way you do.

574
00:47:15.581 --> 00:47:19.127
I'm not bad. I'm just drawn that way.

575
00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:26.843
Weren't you the one I caught playing
patty-cake with old man Acme?

576
00:47:26.926 --> 00:47:31.180
You didn't catch me, Mr Valiant.
You were set up to take those pictures.

577
00:47:31.264 --> 00:47:35.018
-What are you talking about?
-Maroon wanted to blackmail Acme.

578
00:47:35.101 --> 00:47:36.811
I didn't want to have anything
to do with it,

579
00:47:36.894 --> 00:47:39.897
but he said if I didn't
pose for those patty-cake pictures,

580
00:47:39.981 --> 00:47:42.525
Roger would never work
in this town again.

581
00:47:42.608 --> 00:47:44.068
I couldn't let that happen.

582
00:47:44.694 --> 00:47:47.780
I'd do anything
for my husband, Mr Valiant.

583
00:47:48.281 --> 00:47:51.534
-Anything.
-What a wife.

584
00:47:51.617 --> 00:47:55.288
I'm desperate, Mr Valiant.
Can't you see how much I need you?

585
00:47:56.789 --> 00:47:58.624
Dabblin' in watercolors, Eddie?

586
00:48:03.713 --> 00:48:05.048
Sorry.

587
00:48:06.132 --> 00:48:09.302
Good-bye, Eddie. My offer stands firm.

588
00:48:09.802 --> 00:48:11.763
Think about it.

589
00:48:20.438 --> 00:48:21.939
Well!

590
00:48:23.357 --> 00:48:26.319
Do you want to tell me what she was
doing with her arms around you?

591
00:48:26.402 --> 00:48:28.905
Probably lookin' for
a good place to stick a knife.

592
00:48:28.988 --> 00:48:31.908
Come on, Eddie.
I caught you with your pants down!

593
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:34.243
Yeah, but I... Dolores, come...

594
00:48:38.498 --> 00:48:39.540
Come on, Dolores.

595
00:48:39.624 --> 00:48:42.126
You don't believe a painted hussy
like that could turn my head.

596
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.128
She's just trying to get
her hands on the rabbit.

597
00:48:44.212 --> 00:48:46.422
That's not all she's trying
to get her hands on.

598
00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:49.175
Now, look, Dolores, listen.
Listen to me.

599
00:48:49.258 --> 00:48:53.262
Look, I want you to go out, I want you
to buy yourself a new swim suit,

600
00:48:53.346 --> 00:48:55.181
'cause you and me
are going to Catalina.

601
00:48:55.264 --> 00:48:57.266
I'm on the verge
of wrappin' up this case.

602
00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:58.768
No, you're not, Eddie.

603
00:48:58.851 --> 00:49:02.772
That's what I came to tell you.
I stopped by Probate.

604
00:49:02.855 --> 00:49:05.858
Maroon's not after Toontown
like you thought.

605
00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:08.820
It's Cloverleaf that wants
to get their hands on Toontown.

606
00:49:08.903 --> 00:49:10.613
They put in the highest bid.

607
00:49:10.696 --> 00:49:13.783
And unless Mr Acme's will
shows up by midnight tonight,

608
00:49:13.866 --> 00:49:16.369
Cloverleaf is gonna own Toontown.

609
00:49:16.452 --> 00:49:20.206
-What? At midnight tonight?
-That's right.

610
00:49:20.998 --> 00:49:24.544
First they buy the Red Car, then they
want to get their hands on Toontown.

611
00:49:26.379 --> 00:49:29.423
-I don't get it.
-Yes!

612
00:49:29.674 --> 00:49:31.384
Roger!

613
00:49:35.221 --> 00:49:37.390
The rabbit. Get the judge.

614
00:49:37.723 --> 00:49:39.892
<i>A joke don't sit there on your brain</i>

615
00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:40.977
Nice shirt.

616
00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.397
Who's your tailor, Quasimodo?

617
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.483
<i>My buddy's Eddie V
A sourpuss, you'll see</i>

618
00:49:47.567 --> 00:49:50.820
<i>But when I'm done he'll need no gun
'cause a joker he will be</i>

619
00:49:50.903 --> 00:49:52.989
<i>C, D, E, F, G</i>

620
00:49:53.072 --> 00:49:57.326
<i>H, I... I would love
to raise some Cain</i>

621
00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:00.329
<i>Believe me, it's no strain
It feels so great 'cause I'm so tight</i>

622
00:50:00.413 --> 00:50:02.331
<i>And look, there is no pain</i>

623
00:50:02.415 --> 00:50:09.297
<i>No pain. No pain. No pain
No pain. No pain. No...</i>

624
00:50:11.966 --> 00:50:14.260
-No!
-Hey, wait!

625
00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:20.308
Hey, who turned out the lights?

626
00:50:20.391 --> 00:50:23.644
I can't see a thing! What's goin' on?

627
00:50:23.728 --> 00:50:25.313
You crazy rabbit!

628
00:50:25.396 --> 00:50:28.274
I've been out there risking my neck
for you, and what are you doin'?

629
00:50:28.357 --> 00:50:30.109
Singin' and dancin'!

630
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.698
But I'm a Toon. Toons
are supposed to make people laugh.

631
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:36.991
Sit down!

632
00:50:37.074 --> 00:50:40.369
You don't understand.
Those people needed to laugh.

633
00:50:40.453 --> 00:50:42.872
Yeah, and when they're done laughin',
they'll call the cops!

634
00:50:42.955 --> 00:50:45.249
That guy Angelo would
rat on you for a nickel.

635
00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:47.627
Not Angelo! He'd never turn me in.

636
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:49.712
Why? Because you made him laugh?

637
00:50:49.795 --> 00:50:53.841
That's right.
A laugh can be a very powerful thing.

638
00:50:53.925 --> 00:50:57.637
Why, sometimes in life,
it's the only weapon we have.

639
00:50:58.137 --> 00:50:59.597
Laughter is the most...

640
00:51:00.848 --> 00:51:03.809
"Ix-nay." "Ix-nay."

641
00:51:09.732 --> 00:51:12.151
I'm looking for a murderer.

642
00:51:24.622 --> 00:51:26.207
A rabbit.

643
00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:30.962
A Toon rabbit.

644
00:51:31.754 --> 00:51:35.341
About yea big.

645
00:51:36.133 --> 00:51:37.218
Look.

646
00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:41.639
There's no rabbit here,
so don't harass my customers.

647
00:51:41.722 --> 00:51:45.935
I didn't come here to harass.
I came here to reward.

648
00:52:21.512 --> 00:52:24.432
Hey. I seen a rabbit.

649
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:28.894
-Where?
-See?

650
00:52:35.901 --> 00:52:39.155
-Where?
-He's right here in the bar.

651
00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.414
Say "hello," Harvey.

652
00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:56.922
I told you so.

653
00:53:19.153 --> 00:53:23.115
<i>The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down.</i>

654
00:53:23.699 --> 00:53:28.245
Quite a loony selection
for a group of drunken reprobates.

655
00:53:35.461 --> 00:53:36.629
He's here!

656
00:53:41.258 --> 00:53:42.593
Stop that laughing!

657
00:53:48.808 --> 00:53:50.935
Have you forgotten
what happened last time?

658
00:53:51.018 --> 00:53:53.896
If you don't stop this laughing,
you're gonna end up dead,

659
00:53:53.979 --> 00:53:56.565
just like your idiot hyena cousins!

660
00:53:56.649 --> 00:54:00.778
Say, boss, you want we should
"disresemble" the place?

661
00:54:00.861 --> 00:54:06.659
No, Sergeant. Disassembling
the place won't be necessary.

662
00:54:06.784 --> 00:54:10.955
The rabbit is going to come right to me.

663
00:54:14.917 --> 00:54:20.131
No Toon can resist
the old Shave and a Haircut trick.

664
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.474
I don't know who's toonier,
you or Doom.

665
00:54:32.143 --> 00:54:33.727
Roger!

666
00:54:37.064 --> 00:54:38.274
Roger.

667
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:40.860
Roger, no!

668
00:54:45.197 --> 00:54:47.158
Roger, don't...

669
00:54:49.702 --> 00:54:52.746
<i>Shave and a haircut</i>

670
00:54:54.832 --> 00:54:56.625
<i>Two bits</i>

671
00:55:00.921 --> 00:55:05.718
Hey, Judge, what should we do
with the wallflower?

672
00:55:05.801 --> 00:55:07.636
We'll see to him later.

673
00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:12.224
Right now I feel like
dispensing some justice.

674
00:55:13.184 --> 00:55:14.435
Bring me some dip.

675
00:55:20.566 --> 00:55:24.445
Does the condemned have anything to
say before his sentence is carried out?

676
00:55:24.862 --> 00:55:26.322
Why, yeah. I...

677
00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:34.580
Dolores, a bourbon,
and make it a double.

678
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.832
A fine time for a drink, Eddie.

679
00:55:36.916 --> 00:55:38.792
Maybe you'd like a bowl
of pretzels to go with it!

680
00:55:38.876 --> 00:55:40.586
Pour the drink, Dolores.

681
00:55:46.926 --> 00:55:48.427
Hey, Judge!

682
00:55:49.553 --> 00:55:51.805
Doesn't a dying rabbit
deserve a last request?

683
00:55:51.889 --> 00:55:54.558
Yeah! Nose plugs would be nice.

684
00:55:54.642 --> 00:55:57.102
I think you want a drink.

685
00:55:59.146 --> 00:56:02.483
-How 'bout it, Judge?
-Well, why not.

686
00:56:02.566 --> 00:56:05.861
I don't mind prolonging the execution.

687
00:56:05.945 --> 00:56:06.946
Happy trails.

688
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:09.281
No, thanks, Eddie.
I'm tr yin' to cut down.

689
00:56:09.365 --> 00:56:11.367
-Drink the drink!
-But I don't want the drink.

690
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:12.493
He doesn't want the drink.

691
00:56:12.576 --> 00:56:13.953
-He does! You do!
-I don't!

692
00:56:14.036 --> 00:56:15.329
-I don't! I don't!
-You do!

693
00:56:15.412 --> 00:56:17.206
-You do! You don't.
-I don't!

694
00:56:17.289 --> 00:56:20.167
-I do!
-You don't!

695
00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:23.546
Listen, when I say "I do,"
that means I do!

696
00:56:46.986 --> 00:56:47.987
Come on.

697
00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:04.837
Gotcha, kid.

698
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:12.094
Come on, Eddie, let's get out of here!

699
00:57:12.177 --> 00:57:14.471
Move it, pops! Yikes!

700
00:57:16.098 --> 00:57:19.351
That was quick thinkin', Eddie.
Nothing like using the old spine flower,

701
00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:21.645
-the wise noodle, the smart puddin'.
-Roger!

702
00:57:21.729 --> 00:57:24.148
-Yikes! Stop, will ya?
-Let's use this!

703
00:57:24.857 --> 00:57:26.567
Let's get out of here!
What are you waitin' for?

704
00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:27.693
There's no damn key!

705
00:57:27.776 --> 00:57:30.779
Hey, you weasels, let me out of here,
will ya? Come on!

706
00:57:30.863 --> 00:57:34.491
-I've got to make a livin'!
-Benny, is that you?

707
00:57:34.575 --> 00:57:39.204
No, it's Eleanor Roosevelt.
Come on, Roger! Get me out of here!

708
00:57:39.288 --> 00:57:43.334
Eddie, we got ourselves a ride!
Open the doors!

709
00:57:50.382 --> 00:57:51.467
That's better.

710
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.637
I can't believe they locked me up
for driving on the sidewalk.

711
00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.805
Come on, Eddie. Get in!

712
00:57:56.889 --> 00:57:59.558
-It was just a couple of miles.
-I'll drive!

713
00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:02.311
-But I wanna drive!
-No, I'll drive!

714
00:58:02.394 --> 00:58:05.981
I'm the cab. Out of my way, pencil neck!

715
00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:08.150
How about this weather, huh?

716
00:58:08.442 --> 00:58:11.487
-It never rains!
-Would you beat it!

717
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:13.656
They've sprung the cab! Let's go!

718
00:58:13.739 --> 00:58:15.991
And how about those
Brooklyn Dodgers?

719
00:58:16.075 --> 00:58:17.368
Are they bums, or what?

720
00:58:17.743 --> 00:58:19.411
Move over. I'm drivin'!

721
00:58:22.122 --> 00:58:24.166
Benny, Eddie, we got company!

722
00:58:24.249 --> 00:58:26.919
Will you look at these two?
Excuse me, ladies!

723
00:58:28.379 --> 00:58:31.215
Now that's what I call
a couple of road hogs.

724
00:58:31.715 --> 00:58:36.011
-I'm gonna blow his head off.
-Benny, look out for the Red Car!

725
00:58:45.437 --> 00:58:48.232
Benny, there's cops right behind us!

726
00:58:48.315 --> 00:58:51.068
Not for long, Roger.

727
00:58:51.443 --> 00:58:54.113
-No!
-Now they're right in front of us.

728
00:58:55.739 --> 00:58:58.117
Eddie, we're goin' backwards.
Turn us around.

729
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.119
Give me the wheel. Give me the wheel!

730
00:59:04.206 --> 00:59:07.167
-The cops are still on our tail!
-I know the cops are on our tail!

731
00:59:07.251 --> 00:59:11.213
What do you think I am?
Benny! No. No!

732
00:59:11.922 --> 00:59:13.632
Pull the lever!

733
00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:15.300
-Which one?
-Which one?

734
00:59:15.384 --> 00:59:16.510
Which one?

735
00:59:18.053 --> 00:59:19.430
I'm gonna ram 'em.

736
00:59:21.056 --> 00:59:22.641
What the heck?

737
00:59:26.145 --> 00:59:28.147
I'm gettin' too old for this!

738
00:59:35.529 --> 00:59:37.072
Jumpin' jeepers!

739
00:59:37.156 --> 00:59:39.575
Hey, Roger, what do you call
the middle of a song?

740
00:59:39.658 --> 00:59:41.660
Gee, I don't know. A bridge!

741
00:59:45.038 --> 00:59:48.250
-Well, fellas, where can I drop ya?
-Yeah. Somewhere we can hide.

742
00:59:48.333 --> 00:59:51.253
I got just the place. And incidentally,

743
00:59:51.336 --> 00:59:54.673
if you should ever need a ride,
just stick out your thumb.

744
00:59:54.757 --> 00:59:57.301
Hey, share the road, will ya, lady?

745
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:02.014
<i>Well that wasn't so bad, was it?</i>

746
01:00:17.029 --> 01:00:20.783
Boy, did you see that?
Nobody takes a wallop like Goofy.

747
01:00:20.866 --> 01:00:24.369
What timing, what finesse!
What a genius!

748
01:00:28.373 --> 01:00:31.543
We're supposed to be hiding.
What's wrong with you?

749
01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:33.295
What's wrong with you?

750
01:00:33.378 --> 01:00:36.131
You're the only person
in this theater that isn't laughing.

751
01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:39.718
Is there nothing that can permeate
your impervious puss?

752
01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:43.806
Hey, Eddie! Boy, nothin'.

753
01:00:43.889 --> 01:00:48.852
What could've possibly happened to
you to turn you into such a sourpuss?

754
01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:52.105
You want to know? I'll tell you.

755
01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:55.567
-A Toon killed my brother.
-A Toon? No.

756
01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.611
That's right. A Toon.

757
01:00:59.446 --> 01:01:02.991
We were investigating a robbery at
the First National Bank of Toontown.

758
01:01:03.492 --> 01:01:06.954
Back in those days, me and Teddy
liked working Toontown.

759
01:01:07.037 --> 01:01:08.914
We thought it was a lot of laughs.

760
01:01:10.332 --> 01:01:12.918
Anyway, this guy

761
01:01:14.461 --> 01:01:16.797
got away with a zillion simoleons.

762
01:01:20.217 --> 01:01:22.761
We trailed him to a little dive
down on Yockster Street.

763
01:01:24.304 --> 01:01:25.764
We went in.

764
01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:30.894
Only he got the drop on us, literally.

765
01:01:32.646 --> 01:01:35.649
Dropped a piano on us from 15 storys.

766
01:01:37.192 --> 01:01:38.652
Broke my arm.

767
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.780
Teddy never made it.

768
01:01:42.906 --> 01:01:45.409
I never did find out who that guy was.

769
01:01:45.951 --> 01:01:47.744
All I remember was,

770
01:01:47.828 --> 01:01:50.581
he was standin' over me, laughin',

771
01:01:50.664 --> 01:01:53.876
with those burnin' red eyes

772
01:01:53.959 --> 01:01:56.169
and that high, squeaky voice.

773
01:01:58.797 --> 01:02:01.049
He disappeared
into Toontown after that.

774
01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:06.388
No wonder you hate me.

775
01:02:06.513 --> 01:02:10.642
If a Toon killed my brother,
I'd hate me too!

776
01:02:11.435 --> 01:02:13.854
Come on, don't cry. I don't hate you.

777
01:02:13.937 --> 01:02:16.023
-Yes, you do.
-No, I don't.

778
01:02:16.106 --> 01:02:17.399
You do hate me.

779
01:02:17.482 --> 01:02:21.111
Otherwise you wouldn't have
yanked my ears all those times.

780
01:02:21.194 --> 01:02:24.072
Well, I'm sorry I yanked your ears.

781
01:02:24.156 --> 01:02:26.783
All the times you yanked my ears?

782
01:02:27.784 --> 01:02:31.330
-All the times I yanked your ears.
-Apology accepted.

783
01:02:31.663 --> 01:02:35.459
Put 'er there, pal. I feel better. Oh, boy!

784
01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:38.086
I hope it's another cartoon!

785
01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:41.214
Jeepers, another stupid newsreel.

786
01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:43.675
I hate the news.

787
01:02:45.385 --> 01:02:47.804
-Did you get all my stuff?
-Yes.

788
01:02:48.388 --> 01:02:50.974
It's all packed up in the car outside.

789
01:02:51.725 --> 01:02:55.395
Would have been here right after you
called, but I had to shake the weasels.

790
01:02:56.229 --> 01:03:00.233
Yeah. I'm sorry about
the trouble in the bar.

791
01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.863
Oh, hell. Stuffing olives
for a living wasn't for me anyway.

792
01:03:06.365 --> 01:03:07.699
Dolores?

793
01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:14.456
You oughta find yourself a good man.

794
01:03:17.376 --> 01:03:19.419
But I already have a good man.

795
01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:29.346
Please, don't mind me.

796
01:03:32.849 --> 01:03:33.934
You better get going, Eddie.

797
01:03:36.603 --> 01:03:41.274
<i>A near miss, but this miss

<i>California Cloverleaf...</i>

799
01:03:44.111 --> 01:03:46.238
Glad Teddy's not here
to see me running away

800
01:03:46.321 --> 01:03:51.201
-with my tail between my legs.
-It's not so bad once you get used to it.

01:04:22.482 --> 01:04:26.278
-Is that it, or are you scared?
-Please! Me, scared?

810
01:04:26.361 --> 01:04:28.155
Don't be ridiculous.

811
01:04:29.656 --> 01:04:33.452
When you called Maroon, you told him
you had the will, but you don't.

812
01:04:33.535 --> 01:04:35.954
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.

813
01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:38.206
He might try to kill ya.

814
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:42.044

beep the horn twice.

01:04:47.799 --> 01:04:51.219
Yeah, that's it. Beep the horn twice.
Cover your back.

818
01:04:51.303 --> 01:04:56.141
Boy, I'm ready. Dukes up,
eyes peeled, ears to the ground.

819
01:04:56.224 --> 01:04:59.436
Why, nobody gets the drop
on Roger Rabbit.

820

What's up, Doc?

821
01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:25.670
Valiant, what are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

822
01:05:25.754 --> 01:05:28.048
You need a heart
before you can have an attack.

823
01:05:28.131 --> 01:05:30.509
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got the will?

824
01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:33.637
Sure. I got the will.

825
01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:38.100
The question is, do you have the way?

826
01:05:38.183 --> 01:05:40.769
'Cause I can tell you now,
it ain't gonna come cheap.

827
01:05:40.852 --> 01:05:43.772
You got a lot of brass
coming up here by yourself.

01:05:43.855 --> 01:05:45.524
Who said I'm here by myself?

829
01:05:57.744 --> 01:05:59.704
Let me see that will.

830
01:05:59.913 --> 01:06:02.165
-I told you, I got it.
-I want to see it now!

831
01:06:06.336 --> 01:06:10.966
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways"?

832
01:06:11.049 --> 01:06:14.010
-This supposed to be a joke?
-No, this is.

833
01:06:18.932 --> 01:06:20.725
Get up! Come on.

834
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:22.894
What are you gonna do to me, Valiant?

835
01:06:23.812 --> 01:06:27.107
I'm gonna listen to you
spin the Cloverleaf scenario.

836
01:06:27.899 --> 01:06:31.736
A story of greed, sex and murder.

837
01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:35.407
And the parts that I don't like,
I'm gonna edit out.

838
01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:38.618
You got it all wrong!
I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer!

839
01:06:38.702 --> 01:06:41.163
Everybody's got to have a hobby.

840
01:06:43.248 --> 01:06:45.250
Stop it. Stop it! Stop it!

841
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.753
The truth is, I had a chance
to sell my studio,

842
01:06:48.837 --> 01:06:51.965
but Cloverleaf wouldn't buy my property
unless Acme sold them his.

843
01:06:52.048 --> 01:06:53.758
The stubborn bastard wouldn't sell,

844
01:06:53.842 --> 01:06:57.262
so I was gonna blackmail Acme with
pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

845
01:06:57.345 --> 01:07:00.932
Blackmail, that's all!
I've been around Toons all my life!

846
01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:05.103
-I didn't want to see 'em destroyed!
-Toons destroyed? Why?

847
01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:08.148
-If I tell ya, I'm a dead man.
-You're a dead man if you don't tell me.

848
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:11.776
Unless Acme's will shows
by midnight tonight,

849
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.362
Toontown's going to be
live for the free...

850
01:07:39.888 --> 01:07:41.306
Roger!

851
01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:49.708
-What the...
-Yeah, what in Sam Hill...

852
01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:53.795
Eddie Valiant!
Well, you're a sight for sore eyes!

853
01:08:53.878 --> 01:08:56.631
I ain't seen you in nigh on to five years.

854
01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:59.301
-Where've you been?
-Drunk.

855
01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:04.180
-You feeling frisky tonight, fellas?
-Yeah!

856
01:09:06.224 --> 01:09:07.892
Let's go.

857
01:10:08.328 --> 01:10:11.790
<i>Smile, darn ya, smile</i>

858
01:10:12.082 --> 01:10:17.087
<i>You know, this old world
is a great world after all</i>

859
01:10:17.462 --> 01:10:21.007
<i>Smile, darn ya, smile</i>

860
01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:26.054
<i>And right away watch lady luck
pay you a call</i>

861
01:10:26.638 --> 01:10:30.892
<i>Things are never black
as they are painted</i>

862
01:10:31.351 --> 01:10:34.104
<i>Time for you and joy to get acquainted</i>

863
01:10:34.187 --> 01:10:35.438
Hi, Eddie!

864
01:10:35.855 --> 01:10:39.317
Hi, Eddie! Hi, Eddie! Bye, Eddie!

865
01:10:51.955 --> 01:10:55.125
Tallyho! Tallyho!

866
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:06.761
Get out of here!

867
01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:20.400
Going up, sir.

868
01:11:25.155 --> 01:11:26.906
Mind the step, sir.

869
01:11:28.533 --> 01:11:30.410
Hold on, sir.

870
01:11:38.918 --> 01:11:40.879
Your floor, sir.

871
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:45.341
Have a good day, sir.

872
01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.347
Gotcha.

873
01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.062
A man!

874
01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:09.282
Yoo-hoo, lover boy! It's Lena Hyena!

875
01:12:16.456 --> 01:12:18.208
Oh, no!

876
01:12:27.008 --> 01:12:30.011
-Oh, "wook," piggies.
-Hi, Tweety.

877
01:12:30.094 --> 01:12:33.890
This "wittle" piggy went to market.
This "wittle" piggy stayed home.

878
01:12:33.973 --> 01:12:36.434
-No.
-This "wittle" piggy had roast beef.

879
01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.478
And this "wittle" piggy had...

880
01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:42.065
Ran out of piggies.

881
01:12:47.987 --> 01:12:51.574
What's up, Doc? Jumpin' without
a parachute? Kinda dangerous, ain't it?

882
01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:54.160
-Yeah.
-Yeah. You could get Killed.

883
01:12:54.244 --> 01:12:57.664
-You guys got a spare?
-Bugs does.

884
01:12:57.747 --> 01:12:59.791
-Yeah?
-Yeah, but I don't think you want it.

885
01:12:59.874 --> 01:13:03.336
-I do! I do! Give it to me!
-Gee, better let him have it, Bugs.

886
01:13:03.419 --> 01:13:07.131
Okay, Doc. Whatever you say.
Here's the spare.

887
01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:08.758
Thank you.

888
01:13:11.427 --> 01:13:12.762
Ah, no!

889
01:13:14.639 --> 01:13:17.642
-Ah, poor fella.
-Yeah. Ain't I a stinker?

890
01:13:21.521 --> 01:13:22.897
My man!

891
01:13:28.444 --> 01:13:30.321
Come to Lena!

892
01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:40.164
Toons. Gets 'em every time.

893
01:13:58.391 --> 01:13:59.892
-Gesundheit.
-Thank you.

894
01:14:02.061 --> 01:14:03.187
Valiant?

895
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:10.695
I always knew I'd get it in Toontown.

896
01:14:10.778 --> 01:14:12.196
Behind you!

897
01:14:14.782 --> 01:14:15.825
Drop it, lady!

898
01:14:15.908 --> 01:14:17.869
I just saved your life,
and you still don't trust me?

899
01:14:17.952 --> 01:14:21.205
-I don't trust anybody or anything!
-Not even your own eyes?

900
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.835
That's the gun that killed R.K. Maroon,
and Doom pulled the trigger.

901
01:14:25.918 --> 01:14:28.046
-Doom?
-I followed him to the studio,

902
01:14:28.129 --> 01:14:29.756
but I was too late to stop him.

903
01:14:29.839 --> 01:14:32.300
That's right! You'll never stop me!

904
01:14:32.383 --> 01:14:35.219
-You're dead! You're both dead!
-Doom!

905
01:14:38.222 --> 01:14:40.391
-Which way'd he go?
-Well, I don't know.

906
01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:44.228
-Well, he went that-a-way.
-Let's go!

907
01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:45.688
Dum-dums.

908
01:14:45.772 --> 01:14:47.231
-Come on.
-Yeah.

909
01:14:48.441 --> 01:14:51.611
-Oh, no. Where's Roger?
-Roger?

910
01:14:51.694 --> 01:14:53.404
He chickened out on me
back at the studio.

911
01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:54.530
No, he didn't.

912
01:14:54.614 --> 01:14:56.824
I hit him on the head with a frying pan
and put him in the trunk

913
01:14:56.908 --> 01:14:58.368
so he wouldn't get hurt.

914
01:14:58.451 --> 01:14:59.702
Makes perfect sense.

915
01:14:59.786 --> 01:15:01.579
We're obviously not
going anywhere in my car.

916
01:15:01.704 --> 01:15:02.747
Let's take yours.

917
01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:07.752
I got a feeling somebody already did.

918
01:15:07.835 --> 01:15:09.754
From the looks of it,
I'd say it was Roger.

919
01:15:09.837 --> 01:15:12.799
My honey bunny was never
very good behind the wheel.

920
01:15:12.882 --> 01:15:16.302
-A better lover than a driver, huh?
-You'd better believe it, buster.

921
01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:18.680
It's the weasels. This way!

922
01:15:18.763 --> 01:15:20.723
-We'll take Gingerbread Lane.
-No, wait! No, no!

923
01:15:20.848 --> 01:15:23.851
Gingerbread Lane's this way.

924
01:15:23.935 --> 01:15:26.437
So, Valiant, you call a cab, or what?

925
01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:30.191
Hubba-hubba-hubba.
Allow me, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

926
01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:35.113
So how long have you
known it was Doom?

927
01:15:35.196 --> 01:15:38.199
Before poor Marvin Acme was killed,
he confided in me

928
01:15:38.282 --> 01:15:40.702
that Doom wanted
to get his hands on Toontown,

929
01:15:40.785 --> 01:15:42.120
and he wouldn't stop at anything.

930
01:15:42.203 --> 01:15:43.746
So he gave you the will
for safekeeping.

931
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:44.914
That's what he told me.

932
01:15:44.997 --> 01:15:46.207
Except when I opened the envelope,

933
01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:48.751
there was only
a blank piece of paper inside.

934
01:15:49.377 --> 01:15:51.671
-A joker to the end.
-So where to, already?

935
01:15:51.754 --> 01:15:54.340
-My meter's runnin'!
-I have to find my darling husband.

936
01:15:54.424 --> 01:15:55.883
I'm so worried about him.

937
01:15:55.967 --> 01:15:58.553
Seriously, what do you see in that guy?

938
01:15:58.636 --> 01:15:59.971
He makes me laugh.

939
01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:14.318
I've been dipped!

940
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:25.329
What an unfortunate accident. Nothing
more treacherous than a slippery road

941
01:16:25.413 --> 01:16:29.041
especially when driving
in a maniacal Toon vehicle.

942
01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.591
-Good work, boss.
-Don't just stand there. Help them.

943
01:16:37.133 --> 01:16:39.051
-Put them in my car.
-Follow me.

944
01:16:39.135 --> 01:16:42.805
And I think they'll enjoy attending
the ribbon cutting at the Acme Factory.

945
01:16:42.889 --> 01:16:44.849
Come on, you mugs.

946
01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.491
We searched Valiant, boss.
The will ain't on him.

947
01:17:01.574 --> 01:17:06.037
-Then frisk the woman!
-I'll handle this one.

948
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:13.085
Nice booby trap.

949
01:17:23.346 --> 01:17:24.597
Do they have the will, or not?

950
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.558
-Nah, just a stupid love letter.
-No matter.

951
01:17:27.892 --> 01:17:31.604
I doubt if that will is gonna show up
in the next 15 minutes anyway.

952
01:17:32.688 --> 01:17:36.150
-What happens in the next 15 minutes?
-Toontown will be legally mine.

953
01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:38.402
Lock, stock and barrel.

954
01:17:44.492 --> 01:17:46.369
Benny, is that you?

955
01:17:46.744 --> 01:17:49.247
No, it's Shirley Temple!

956
01:17:50.748 --> 01:17:53.125
Jumpin' jeepers! What happened?

957
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:57.171
Doom grabbed your wife and Valiant
and took 'em to the Acme Factory.

958
01:17:57.255 --> 01:17:59.966
The Acme Factory?
I know where that is. Get in!

959
01:18:00.049 --> 01:18:03.177
Move over, Rog. You've done
enough driving for one night.

960
01:18:05.596 --> 01:18:08.808
Toontown right on
the other side of the wall, boss.

961
01:18:08.891 --> 01:18:12.186
You see, Mr Valiant,
the successful conclusion of this case

962
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:16.315
draws the curtains on my career
as a jurist in Toontown.

963
01:18:16.399 --> 01:18:20.152
I'm retiring to take a new role
in the private sector.

964
01:18:20.236 --> 01:18:23.447
That wouldn't be Cloverleaf
Industries by any chance, huh?

965
01:18:24.615 --> 01:18:26.617
You're looking at the sole stockholder.

966
01:18:30.913 --> 01:18:34.625
Benny, you go for the cops.
I'm gonna save my wife.

967
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:38.421
Be careful with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon, you know.

968
01:18:38.838 --> 01:18:40.506
This is no way to make a livin'.

969
01:18:42.925 --> 01:18:45.136
Wouldn't you know. Locked.

970
01:18:55.062 --> 01:18:57.648
Can you guess what this is?

971
01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:04.280
Oh, my God! It's dip!

972
01:19:04.363 --> 01:19:08.993
That's right, my dear. Enough to dip
Toontown off the face of the Earth!

973
01:19:12.288 --> 01:19:14.206
A vehicle of my own design.

974
01:19:15.249 --> 01:19:18.210
5,000 gallons of heated dip

975
01:19:18.294 --> 01:19:22.381
pumped at enormous velocity
through a pressurized water cannon.

976
01:19:23.466 --> 01:19:27.011
Toontown will be erased
in a matter of minutes.

977
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:33.392
I suppose you think no one's going
to notice Toontown's disappeared?

978
01:19:33.476 --> 01:19:34.810
Who's got time to wonder
what happened

979
01:19:34.894 --> 01:19:36.395
to some ridiculous talking mice

980
01:19:36.479 --> 01:19:39.440
when you're driving by
at 75 miles an hour?

981
01:19:39.523 --> 01:19:42.652
What are you talking about?
There's no road past Toontown.

982
01:19:42.735 --> 01:19:45.112
Not yet! Several months ago,

983
01:19:45.196 --> 01:19:49.659
I had the good providence to stumble
upon this plan of the city council's.

984
01:19:49.742 --> 01:19:53.037
A construction plan of epic proportions.

985
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.415
They're calling it a freeway.

986
01:19:56.499 --> 01:19:59.961
Freeway? What the hell's a freeway?

987
01:20:00.044 --> 01:20:04.006
Eight lanes of shimmering cement
running from here to Pasadena.

988
01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:06.550
Smooth, safe, fast.

989
01:20:06.634 --> 01:20:09.470
Traffic jams will be a thing of the past.

990
01:20:09.553 --> 01:20:13.307
So that's why you killed
Acme and Maroon? For this freeway?

991
01:20:13.891 --> 01:20:17.228
-I don't get it.
-Of course not. You lack vision.

992
01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:21.899
I see a place where people
get on and off the freeway.

993
01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:26.404
On and off, off and on,
all day and all night!

994
01:20:26.904 --> 01:20:32.284
Soon, where Toontown once stood
will be a string of gas stations,

995
01:20:32.368 --> 01:20:37.623
inexpensive motels, restaurants
that serve rapidly prepared food,

996
01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:42.294
tire salons, automobile dealerships,

997
01:20:42.378 --> 01:20:45.965
and wonderful, wonderful billboards

998
01:20:46.048 --> 01:20:49.385
reaching as far as the eye can see!

999
01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:55.599
-My God, it'll be beautiful.
-Come on!

1000
01:20:56.267 --> 01:20:58.394
Nobody's gonna
drive this lousy freeway

1001
01:20:58.477 --> 01:21:00.354
when they can take
the Red Car for a nickel.

1002
01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:03.149
Oh, they'll drive. They'll have to.

1003
01:21:03.232 --> 01:21:07.945
You see, I bought the Red Car
so I could dismantle it.

1004
01:21:09.196 --> 01:21:10.656
What the...

1005
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:22.585
Okay, nobody move!

1006
01:21:22.668 --> 01:21:25.671
All right, weasels, grab some sky
or I'll let the judge have it!

1007
01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:28.674
-You heard me. I said, drop it.
-Roger, darling!

1008
01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:31.260
Yes, it's me, my dearest.
I'd love to embrace you,

1009
01:21:31.343 --> 01:21:34.346
but first I have to satisfy
my sense of moral outrage!

1010
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:37.391
Put the gun down,
you bucktoothed fool!

1011
01:21:37.475 --> 01:21:41.020
That's it, Doom! Give me another
excuse to pump you full of lead!

1012
01:21:41.103 --> 01:21:43.230
You thought you could
get away with it, didn't ya?

1013
01:21:43.314 --> 01:21:47.109
We Toons may act idiotic,
but we're not stupid!

1014
01:21:47.193 --> 01:21:49.737
We demand justice,
but the real meaning of the word

1015
01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.615
probably hits you like a ton of bricks!

1016
01:21:54.658 --> 01:21:56.160
Roger!

1017
01:21:57.036 --> 01:22:01.040
-Roger, say something!
-Look, stars!

1018
01:22:01.373 --> 01:22:02.958
Ready when you are, Raoul.

1019
01:22:04.293 --> 01:22:05.961
Tie the lovebirds together.

1020
01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:14.720
Come on, lovebirds. What you want?

1021
01:22:14.804 --> 01:22:19.100
Put them up on that hook.
Use that escape-proof Toon rope.

1022
01:22:19.183 --> 01:22:21.769
Time to kill the rabbit.

1023
01:22:26.232 --> 01:22:29.193
Oh, Roger, you were magnificent.

1024
01:22:29.276 --> 01:22:31.987
-Was I really?
-Better than Goofy.

1025
01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:47.795
Roger, darling,
I want you to know I love you.

1026
01:22:48.462 --> 01:22:51.298
I've loved you more than
any woman's ever loved a rabbit.

1027
01:22:53.884 --> 01:22:55.553
It's over, Mr Valiant.

1028
01:23:11.569 --> 01:23:15.156
-Look out, you fools!
-Not so fast.

1029
01:23:15.239 --> 01:23:19.493
One of these days, you idiots
are gonna laugh yourselves to death!

1030
01:23:23.205 --> 01:23:26.250
Shall I "repose" of him right now, boss?

1031
01:23:26.834 --> 01:23:30.588
Let him watch his Toon friends
get dipped, then shoot him.

1032
01:23:32.965 --> 01:23:34.925
With pleasure.

1033
01:23:41.473 --> 01:23:43.684
Everything's funny to you,
ain't it, needle nose?

1034
01:23:43.767 --> 01:23:47.730
You got a problem with that, Valiant?

1035
01:23:48.105 --> 01:23:49.523
Nah.

1036
01:23:49.607 --> 01:23:53.444
I just want you to know something
about the guy you're gonna dip!

1037
01:24:00.576 --> 01:24:03.579
<i>Now Roger is his name
Laughter is his game</i>

1038
01:24:03.662 --> 01:24:06.582
<i>Come on, you dope, untie his rope
and watch him go insane</i>

1039
01:24:18.302 --> 01:24:21.222
-He's lost his mind.
-I don't think so.

1040
01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:28.187
<i>This singing ain't my line
It's tough to make a rhyme</i>

1041
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:31.482
<i>If I get stuck
I'm... I'm out of luck...</i>

1042
01:24:31.565 --> 01:24:34.151
-I'm running out of time!
-Thanks!

1043
01:25:02.721 --> 01:25:05.516
Hey, Eddie, keep it up!
You're killin' 'em!

1044
01:25:05.599 --> 01:25:08.352
You're slayin' 'em!
You're knockin' 'em dead!

1045
01:25:16.151 --> 01:25:19.113
<i>I'm through with taking falls
I'm bouncing off the walls</i>

1046
01:25:19.196 --> 01:25:21.532
<i>Without that gun I'd have some fun
I'd kick you in the...</i>

1047
01:25:22.658 --> 01:25:26.912
-Nose!
-Nose? That don't rhyme with "walls"!

1048
01:25:26.996 --> 01:25:28.706
No, but this does!

1049
01:25:48.225 --> 01:25:50.060
Oh, my goodness!

1050
01:25:50.436 --> 01:25:52.563
Jeepers, that was close!

1051
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:03.073
Bye-bye!

1052
01:26:03.824 --> 01:26:06.201
Eddie, hurry! It's coming back!

1053
01:26:22.843 --> 01:26:25.220
-Oh, no!
-This is it!

1054
01:26:27.056 --> 01:26:28.223
This isn't it!

1055
01:26:44.239 --> 01:26:46.492
<i>Wicked witchcraft</i>

1056
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:51.872
<i>And although I know</i>

1057
01:26:51.955 --> 01:26:56.460
<i>It's strictly taboo</i>

1058
01:26:57.836 --> 01:26:59.338
<i>When...</i>

1059
01:27:23.237 --> 01:27:24.363
Don't move.

1060
01:27:27.533 --> 01:27:29.284
No. No!

1061
01:28:32.973 --> 01:28:34.725
Oh, no!

1062
01:28:40.397 --> 01:28:42.608
Come on, Eddie! Quit playing around!

1063
01:28:44.443 --> 01:28:46.361
-Please!
-Help!

1064
01:28:49.865 --> 01:28:51.575
I wasn't worried. Were you?

1065
01:29:11.803 --> 01:29:12.971
-Hey, look!
-Hey, look!

1066
01:29:29.279 --> 01:29:31.198
Holy smoke! He's a Toon!

1067
01:29:32.241 --> 01:29:34.243
-Surprised?
-Not really.

1068
01:29:34.952 --> 01:29:38.288
That lamebrain freeway idea
could only be cooked up by a Toon.

1069
01:29:39.122 --> 01:29:41.375
Not just any Toon!

1070
01:29:59.142 --> 01:30:00.936
Remember me, Eddie?

1071
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:04.856
When I killed your brother, I talked

1072
01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:07.943
just like this!

1073
01:30:16.827 --> 01:30:18.453
Jumpin' jeepers.

1074
01:30:25.168 --> 01:30:27.713
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

1075
01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.403
Good-bye, my darling. Good-bye!

1076
01:31:40.827 --> 01:31:42.871
I think I'm gonna faint.

1077
01:31:49.711 --> 01:31:51.088
Oh, no!

1078
01:31:54.883 --> 01:31:56.968
I'm melting!

1079
01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:05.102
I'm melting! Melting!

1080
01:32:16.321 --> 01:32:19.282
Eddie! Do something!

1081
01:32:19.491 --> 01:32:21.535
Hurry up, Eddie!

1082
01:32:22.077 --> 01:32:24.079
Do something!

1083
01:32:56.862 --> 01:33:00.991
Eddie, there's dip everywhere!
How are we gonna get down?

1084
01:33:27.184 --> 01:33:29.519
Jeepers, Eddie, that was a close shave.

1085
01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:32.189
I thought for sure
our goose was cooked!

1086
01:33:35.192 --> 01:33:36.777
My hero.

1087
01:33:37.486 --> 01:33:40.238
-Oh, honey bunny.
-Oh, love cup.

1088
01:33:42.199 --> 01:33:45.994
Oh, Roger, you were
a pillar of strength.

1089
01:33:50.332 --> 01:33:54.503
Sister Mary Francis!
What the hell happened in here?

1090
01:33:58.381 --> 01:34:01.051
I've been a cab for 37 years

1091
01:34:01.134 --> 01:34:03.053
and I've never seen a mess like this!

1092
01:34:04.554 --> 01:34:06.973
-What was that, a rubber mask?
-Yeah.

1093
01:34:07.057 --> 01:34:10.519
And this is the rope from the safe
that was dropped on Acme.

1094
01:34:10.602 --> 01:34:14.272
I think your lab boys will find
that paint's a perfect match.

1095
01:34:14.356 --> 01:34:17.567
-Judge Doom killed Marvin Acme.
-And R.K. Maroon.

1096
01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.110
And my brother.

1097
01:34:19.945 --> 01:34:22.614
That's what I call one
seriously disturbed Toon.

1098
01:34:31.164 --> 01:34:32.415
I wonder who he really was.

1099
01:34:32.499 --> 01:34:35.502
I'll tell you one thing, Doc.
He weren't no rabbit.

1100
01:34:35.585 --> 01:34:37.420
-Or a duck.
-Or a dog.

1101
01:34:37.504 --> 01:34:39.172
-Or a little wooden boy.
-Or a sheep.

1102
01:34:39.256 --> 01:34:40.966
-Or a woodpecker.
-Or a pussy.

1103
01:34:42.717 --> 01:34:45.053
-What's that? What is that?
-It's ink.

1104
01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.431
That goof Acme squirted me
with some the other night.

1105
01:34:48.515 --> 01:34:51.726
-Why it's coming out now, I don't know.
-Here's your answer, Eddie.

1106
01:34:51.810 --> 01:34:54.396
Acme Disappearing Reappearing Ink.

1107
01:34:54.479 --> 01:34:58.525
-Boy, that Acme. What a genius!
-Applesauce!

1108
01:34:58.608 --> 01:35:02.320
If he was such a genius, why didn't he
leave his will where we could find it?

1109
01:35:02.404 --> 01:35:05.156
Without it, we're just waitin'
for another developer's wrecking ball!

1110
01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.241
-Roger.
-Yeah?

1111
01:35:06.324 --> 01:35:09.202
That love letter you wrote to your wife
in the Ink and Paint Club.

1112
01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:10.704
Why don't you read it to her now?

1113
01:35:10.787 --> 01:35:14.624
Sure, Eddie.
"Dear Jessica, how do I love thee?

1114
01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:19.880
"Let me count the ways. I, Marvin Acme,
of sound mind and body..."

1115
01:35:19.963 --> 01:35:21.715
-It's the will!
-Give me!

1116
01:35:21.798 --> 01:35:24.217
"Do hereby bequeath in perpetuity

1117
01:35:24.301 --> 01:35:26.177
"the property known as Toontown

1118
01:35:26.261 --> 01:35:28.722
"to those lovable characters,
the Toons!"

1119
01:35:40.942 --> 01:35:44.738
Hey, Eddie, that was a pretty
funny dance you did for the weasels.

1120
01:35:45.071 --> 01:35:47.657
Do you think your days
of being a sourpuss are over?

1121
01:35:48.158 --> 01:35:51.745
-Only time will tell.
-Yeah. Well, put it there, pal.

1122
01:35:51.828 --> 01:35:52.871
Yeah.

1123
01:36:02.339 --> 01:36:05.425
Don't tell me you lost
your sense of humor already.

1124
01:36:09.137 --> 01:36:10.680
Does this answer your question?

1125
01:36:17.687 --> 01:36:19.189
Come on, Roger, let's go home.

1126
01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.441
I'll bake you a carrot cake.

1127
01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:27.739
<i>Smile, darn ya, smile</i>

1128
01:36:27.822 --> 01:36:33.119
<i>You know, this old world
is a great world after all</i>

1129
01:36:33.203 --> 01:36:36.873
<i>Smile, darn ya, smile</i>

1130
01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:41.836
<i>And right away watch lady luck
pay you a call</i>

1131
01:36:42.379 --> 01:36:46.800
<i>Things are never black
as they are painted</i>

1132
01:36:46.883 --> 01:36:50.220
<i>Time for you and joy
to get acquainted</i>

1133
01:36:50.303 --> 01:36:53.473
Okay, move along.
There's nothing else to see.

1134
01:36:53.556 --> 01:36:55.058
That's all, folks.

1135
01:36:55.892 --> 01:36:57.268
I like the sound of that.

1136
01:36:59.437 --> 01:37:00.730
That's all, folks!
