1
00:00:58.314 --> 00:00:59.594
Should we help him?

2
00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:03.600
He's due in the lists in two minutes.
Two minutes or forfeit.

3
00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:05.320
Lend us those.

4
00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:08.315
Right. Left.

5
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.451
-Dead.
-Eh?

6
00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:26.462
Three scores to none after two lances.

7
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.169
As long as Sir Ector doesn't
fall off his horse, we've won.

8
00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:33.633
He's dead.

9
00:01:35.308 --> 00:01:39.258
-What do you mean?
-His life's spark is covered in shite.

10
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.018
His spirit is gone
but his stench remains.

11
00:01:43.232 --> 00:01:46.767
-Does that answer your question?
-No, no, no.

12
00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:49.353
No, he sleeps. Rouse him.

13
00:01:50.323 --> 00:01:52.611
I haven't eaten in three days!

14
00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:54.153
None of us have!

15
00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:57.654
-Let's fetch a priest.
-No, he's not dead!

16
00:01:57.997 --> 00:02:00.951
You wake up! Come on!

17
00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:03.038
Come on!

18
00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:07.129
You manky git!

19
00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:09.882
Roland.

20
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.055
Squire, Sir Ector must report
at once or forfeit the match.

21
00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:18.390
He's on his way.

22
00:02:20.727 --> 00:02:23.135
I haven't eaten in three days!

23
00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:25.561
Three days! What did you eat, mate?

24
00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.390
If you wasn't dead, I would kill you!

25
00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:30.520
I'll ride in his place.

26
00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:34.947
Strip his armor.
I'm riding in his place.

27
00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:39.280
Wat, stop kicking him!
I'm riding in his place. Help me.

28
00:02:40.163 --> 00:02:41.491
What's your name, William?

29
00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:46.870
William Thatcher, answer me
with your name.

30
00:02:48.587 --> 00:02:49.868
It's not Sir William.

31
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.794
It's not Count or Duke or King William.

32
00:02:53.217 --> 00:02:54.213
I know that.

33
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:57.586
You must be of noble birth to compete.

34
00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:01.968
A detail. The landscape is food.
Do you want to eat or not?

35
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.477
If the nobles find out,
there'll be the devil to pay.

36
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.438
Then pray that they don't.

37
00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:51.367
Visor.

38
00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:53.159
Come on, we're late.

39
00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:32.283
The score stands at three lances
to none in favor of Sir Ector.

40
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.408
Lord Philip of Aragon.

41
00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:36.539
Stand ye ready?

42
00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.873
Sir Ector. Stand ye ready?

43
00:05:42.964 --> 00:05:43.960
Ready?

44
00:05:44.257 --> 00:05:46.380
I tilted against Sir Ector many times.

45
00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:49.428
ln practice as his target.
You never struck him.

46
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:53.220
-Badger me not with details.
-The landscape. Stay on the horse.

47
00:05:53.558 --> 00:05:57.141
He needs 3 points.
He has to knock you off the horse.

48
00:05:57.478 --> 00:05:59.637
I know how to score, Roland.

49
00:06:00.773 --> 00:06:03.264
I've waited my whole life
for this moment.

50
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.648
For Sir Ector to shite himself
to death?

51
00:06:44.482 --> 00:06:46.973
Get it in the cradle. ln the cradle.

52
00:06:47.277 --> 00:06:48.557
Get it in the cradle!

53
00:07:10.299 --> 00:07:11.627
William, are you alive?

54
00:07:11.926 --> 00:07:14.084
-We won! We won!
-Can you hear me?

55
00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:18.463
Get off me! William, can you hear me?

56
00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:20.803
We won!

57
00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:23.509
He's breathing. He's breathing!

58
00:07:25.147 --> 00:07:26.689
Sir Ector.

59
00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.687
Sir Ector. Remove your helmet.

60
00:07:37.867 --> 00:07:42.862
My lord, the final blow of the lance
has bent it onto my head.

61
00:07:43.206 --> 00:07:45.198
He says the final blow of the--

62
00:07:47.085 --> 00:07:49.540
I present your champion, my lord.

63
00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:17.060
Twenty.

64
00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:18.526
No, 10.

65
00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.237
-Fifteen.
-Done.

66
00:08:25.914 --> 00:08:27.574
Very good. Cheers.

67
00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:35.130
Fifteen silver florins.
He didn't want that.

68
00:08:35.423 --> 00:08:37.131
That's five for William.

69
00:08:37.425 --> 00:08:41.588
Five for Wat. Five for Roland,
who's going home to England.

70
00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:45.340
Straight to the pub for me.
Eel pie, brie tart...

71
00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:48.475
...tansy cakes with peppermint cream.

72
00:08:53.107 --> 00:08:54.435
We could do this.

73
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.271
We've done it, boy.
That's silver in your hand.

74
00:08:58.112 --> 00:09:01.148
No, I mean, we can do this.
We can be champions.

75
00:09:05.285 --> 00:09:07.159
Give us your coins.

76
00:09:11.249 --> 00:09:12.578
Give me your coins.

77
00:09:16.338 --> 00:09:18.295
Now, that's one for you.

78
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:21.502
And one...for you.

79
00:09:21.843 --> 00:09:24.416
Which leaves 13.

80
00:09:24.846 --> 00:09:27.467
That's 13 for training
and outfitting.

81
00:09:28.308 --> 00:09:30.633
The tournament in Rouen is in a month.

82
00:09:31.018 --> 00:09:33.177
We could split a bigger prize.

83
00:09:34.814 --> 00:09:38.348
In one month we'd be on our way
to glory and riches.

84
00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:44.109
Or lying in a ditch with Sir Ector.
William, I just want to go home.

85
00:09:44.323 --> 00:09:48.866
Tansy cakes. Dilled veal balls.
I'll take my five now.

86
00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:57.167
Oh, wait up.

87
00:09:57.628 --> 00:09:59.786
You're going the wrong way!

88
00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:02.548
You can't even joust.

89
00:10:02.841 --> 00:10:06.541
Most of it is the guts to take a blow.
Guts I have.

90
00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:10.178
And technique?
I have a month to learn that.

91
00:10:10.557 --> 00:10:13.511
And name a man better
with a sword than I am.

92
00:10:13.726 --> 00:10:17.309
-In the practice ring.
-You're not of noble birth.

93
00:10:17.522 --> 00:10:19.064
So, we lie.

94
00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:22.856
How did the nobles become noble
in the first place?

95
00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:27.855
They took it at the tip of a sword.
I'll do it with a lance.

96
00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:30.778
-A blunted lance.
-No matter, Wat.

97
00:10:31.035 --> 00:10:35.910
A man can change his stars. I won't
spend the rest of my life as nothing.

98
00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:40.911
That is nothing. And that's
where glory will take us.

99
00:10:41.253 --> 00:10:45.547
We're peasants. Glory and riches
are beyond our grasp.

100
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:48.546
But a full stomach?
That dream can come true.

101
00:10:58.395 --> 00:11:01.764
If you can take your coins,
go eat cake in England.

102
00:11:02.065 --> 00:11:05.268
But if you can't, you come with me.

103
00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:13.739
You see? Money doesn't matter.

104
00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:29.168
See how hungry I am?

105
00:11:29.592 --> 00:11:31.584
-Do you?
-Damn your stomach, Wat!

106
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:35.596
Roland, please.

107
00:11:38.767 --> 00:11:42.634
With 1 3 silver pieces,
three men can change their stars.

108
00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:52.940
God love you, William.

109
00:11:53.239 --> 00:11:55.565
I know, I know. No one else will.

110
00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:11.088
Unlucky.

111
00:12:12.133 --> 00:12:14.125
-I think he's getting worse.
-He is getting worse.

112
00:12:28.816 --> 00:12:29.978
Switch.

113
00:12:36.323 --> 00:12:37.698
Switch.

114
00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:41.157
Glory and riches. Glory and riches!

115
00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:54.333
You see how dangerous it is?

116
00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:59.173
Faster! Faster!
All right, use those legs!

117
00:12:59.846 --> 00:13:02.171
Come on, Roland. Faster! Faster!

118
00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:08.885
-You missed it.
-You've done it dozens of times.

119
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.184
Well, I guess that means
we should do it again.

120
00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:15.856
Come on.

121
00:13:18.238 --> 00:13:19.519
Come on, ponies.

122
00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.028
Fong him.

123
00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:27.739
Faster. Balance.

124
00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:30.530
No, slower. Keep it steady.

125
00:13:34.296 --> 00:13:36.087
I got it! Look, I got it!

126
00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:51.353
Any minute now.

127
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.086
-Yes, better.
-Nice.

128
00:14:31.768 --> 00:14:34.175
-It's my turn to ride.
-No.

129
00:14:34.437 --> 00:14:37.106
We haven't reached the marker.
And you shouldn't.

130
00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:41.397
How would it look if my squire rode
while I walked?

131
00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:46.196
I don't give a witch's teat!
It's my turn! It's my turn!

132
00:14:46.532 --> 00:14:51.075
Maybe nobody should ride.
The horse is not what he used to be.

133
00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:53.867
Fine. Fine.

134
00:14:56.292 --> 00:14:57.406
Morning.

135
00:14:58.419 --> 00:14:59.533
Morning.

136
00:14:59.878 --> 00:15:01.207
Hoy, sir.

137
00:15:07.135 --> 00:15:08.167
What are you doing?

138
00:15:08.845 --> 00:15:10.921
Uh...trudging.

139
00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:16.467
You know, trudging? To trudge?

140
00:15:16.811 --> 00:15:19.184
To trudge the slow, weary...

141
00:15:19.522 --> 00:15:23.306
...depressing, yet determined walk
of a man who had nothing left...

142
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.144
...except the impulse to simply
soldier on.

143
00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:29.280
Were you robbed?

144
00:15:29.824 --> 00:15:32.493
Interesting question. Yes.

145
00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:35.495
And at the same time,
a huge, resounding, '' No.''

146
00:15:35.872 --> 00:15:40.035
It's more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty, really.

147
00:15:40.334 --> 00:15:43.833
But on the brighter side,
trudging does represent pride.

148
00:15:44.213 --> 00:15:47.831
Pride, resolve and faith
in the good Lord Almighty.

149
00:15:48.175 --> 00:15:50.880
Please, Christ, rescue me
from my current...

150
00:15:52.346 --> 00:15:54.006
...tribulations.

151
00:15:55.516 --> 00:15:57.093
Who are you?

152
00:15:59.686 --> 00:16:01.513
Lilium inter spinas.

153
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.057
The lily among the thorns.

154
00:16:04.357 --> 00:16:07.027
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.
Writing's the game.

155
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.278
Chaucer?

156
00:16:16.494 --> 00:16:18.285
Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer?

157
00:16:22.291 --> 00:16:24.961
-A what?
-''A what?'' A writer.

158
00:16:25.294 --> 00:16:30.289
I write with ink and parchment.
For a penny, I'll scribble anything.

159
00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:34.962
Summonses, decrees, edicts,
warrants, patents of nobility.

160
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:38.971
I've been known to jot down
a poem, if the muse descends.

161
00:16:39.225 --> 00:16:42.225
You probably read my book,
The Book of the Duchess.

162
00:16:45.314 --> 00:16:46.856
Well, it was allegorical.

163
00:16:47.232 --> 00:16:51.064
We won't hold it against you.
Each man decides that for himself.

164
00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:54.396
Did you say patents of nobility?

165
00:16:56.992 --> 00:16:58.569
That's right. I did.

166
00:17:01.913 --> 00:17:03.656
And you gentlemen are?

167
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.416
I am Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

168
00:17:09.337 --> 00:17:14.213
These are my faithful squires,
Delves of Dodgington...

169
00:17:14.884 --> 00:17:17.754
...and Fowlehurst of Crewe.

170
00:17:18.846 --> 00:17:21.218
I'm Richard the Lionheart.
A pleasure.

171
00:17:21.557 --> 00:17:23.799
No, I'm Charlemagne!
John the Baptist!

172
00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:25.393
All right!

173
00:17:26.187 --> 00:17:28.345
Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it.

174
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.191
Now you see that, I do believe...

175
00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:35.022
...Sir Ulrich.

176
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.317
Thank you, Geoff.

177
00:17:41.285 --> 00:17:45.781
Have you any more to say, Master Nude,
or may we be on our way?

178
00:17:46.706 --> 00:17:49.707
-Off to the tournament?
-This is the road to Rouen.

179
00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:54.831
That remains to be seen.
They're limiting the field at Rouen.

180
00:17:55.382 --> 00:18:00.376
Noble birth must be established
for four generations on either side.

181
00:18:01.012 --> 00:18:04.013
Patents of nobility must be provided.

182
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:15.232
Listen, clothe me...

183
00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:20.233
...shoe me, for God's sake, feed me
and you'll have your patents.

184
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.938
No.

185
00:18:23.575 --> 00:18:27.240
-Patents of nobility.
-We need him. We need him.

186
00:18:28.038 --> 00:18:30.494
-Let me handle it.
-Be nice.

187
00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:37.079
Nice, nice, nice.

188
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.465
All right.

189
00:18:41.092 --> 00:18:45.422
Betray us and I will fong you
until your insides are out...

190
00:18:45.764 --> 00:18:50.425
...your outsides are in and your
entrails are your extrails.

191
00:18:56.399 --> 00:18:57.679
Pain.

192
00:18:59.318 --> 00:19:00.777
Lots of pain.

193
00:19:10.454 --> 00:19:14.831
I present Sir Ulrich, whose mother's
father was Shilhard von Rechberg...

194
00:19:15.084 --> 00:19:19.876
...son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,
son of Ghibellines, son of Wendish.

195
00:19:20.172 --> 00:19:23.208
-Wendish inherited the fief--
-That'll do, herald.

196
00:19:23.467 --> 00:19:27.334
Six generations is more than enough.
Show me the patents.

197
00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:41.101
lndicate in which events
shall your Lord Ulrich compete.

198
00:19:44.654 --> 00:19:47.821
He'll first meet Roger Lord Mortimer.

199
00:19:48.199 --> 00:19:50.156
Thank you very much.

200
00:20:00.503 --> 00:20:03.338
I can't believe it.
You did it, Chaucer.

201
00:20:03.672 --> 00:20:06.459
I thank you. I didn't think
we had a chance.

202
00:20:10.512 --> 00:20:12.220
My pleasure, William.

203
00:20:12.514 --> 00:20:14.839
If you don't mind, I'll stick around.

204
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.721
Be my herald, you'll
get part of the winnings.

205
00:20:17.978 --> 00:20:22.225
Done. Now if you don't mind,
I have to see a man about a dog.

206
00:20:25.569 --> 00:20:28.404
Walking out from Cheapside

207
00:20:29.114 --> 00:20:31.735
My fortunes for to seek

208
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.119
I passed along the River Thames

209
00:20:35.411 --> 00:20:38.448
It's waters did they reek

210
00:20:40.583 --> 00:20:42.825
'Twas there I met a pretty lass

211
00:20:43.085 --> 00:20:46.086
She said her name was Nell

212
00:20:58.142 --> 00:21:00.929
Bell or hell rhymes with Nell.

213
00:21:58.533 --> 00:21:59.992
Would you speak to me?

214
00:22:01.161 --> 00:22:03.201
Ah, to speak.

215
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.159
Sir, my sex are marked
by their silence.

216
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:11.206
I would hear you speak
if it cost me my ears.

217
00:22:11.504 --> 00:22:14.541
That is well, for I do not
want silence in my life.

218
00:22:14.924 --> 00:22:16.716
Tell me your name.

219
00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:22.462
-Would you care if I were ugly?
-Yes!

220
00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:25.883
I mean, no. I mean--

221
00:22:26.185 --> 00:22:29.056
You desecrate the house of God!

222
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.782
Tell me your name.

223
00:22:46.747 --> 00:22:50.080
And what would you do
with my name, Sir Hunter?

224
00:22:50.709 --> 00:22:53.378
Call me a fox, for
that is all I am to you.

225
00:22:54.921 --> 00:22:59.382
Then a fox you shall be until
I find your name, my foxy lady.

226
00:23:04.597 --> 00:23:07.053
He's a handsome hunter.
I give him that.

227
00:23:07.392 --> 00:23:10.061
Does this not shock you, ladies?

228
00:23:12.313 --> 00:23:13.594
Certainly, my lord.

229
00:23:14.607 --> 00:23:18.225
I only laugh just
to keep from weeping.

230
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.561
Beauty is such a curse.

231
00:23:24.158 --> 00:23:26.032
Pray your years come swiftly.

232
00:23:26.368 --> 00:23:29.322
Pray your beauty fades
so you may better serve God.

233
00:23:30.372 --> 00:23:33.658
Oh, I do, my lord. I pray for it all
the time.

234
00:23:35.336 --> 00:23:38.420
Why, God, did you curse me
with this face?

235
00:23:39.631 --> 00:23:43.581
God's will has a purpose,
but we may not know it.

236
00:23:47.347 --> 00:23:49.505
Well, that is lovely.

237
00:24:20.254 --> 00:24:23.539
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein...

238
00:24:23.882 --> 00:24:29.221
...defeats Roger Lord Mortimer
one lance to none.

239
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.641
Easy. They'll think l
never broke a lance before.

240
00:24:34.935 --> 00:24:39.347
-But you haven't!
-Ulrich's broken thousands of lances.

241
00:24:39.564 --> 00:24:42.435
Come on. You're due
in the sword ring.

242
00:24:42.776 --> 00:24:44.484
My armor's loose.

243
00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:55.361
Shite. I can't block an overhead.

244
00:24:55.622 --> 00:24:59.240
We can't fix it now.
We're overdue in the sword ring.

245
00:25:00.376 --> 00:25:03.792
It was a mistake to do two events.
I'm too hurried.

246
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.629
-I'll withdraw from the sword.
-Sword's what you're best at.

247
00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:11.336
But the prizes and prestige
are bigger in the joust.

248
00:25:11.637 --> 00:25:14.804
Ulrich von Lichtenstein?
I am Simon the Summoner.

249
00:25:15.849 --> 00:25:18.091
I'm overdue at the sword ring.

250
00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:22.312
I must detain you
on behalf of your herald.

251
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.814
You were never robbed.

252
00:25:28.028 --> 00:25:30.234
I have a gambling problem.

253
00:25:31.198 --> 00:25:33.155
I can't help myself.

254
00:25:33.492 --> 00:25:36.362
And these people will...

255
00:25:37.078 --> 00:25:39.949
...literally take the clothes
off your back.

256
00:25:41.332 --> 00:25:43.325
What are we supposed to do?

257
00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:48.045
He assured us that you,
his liege, would pay us.

258
00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:53.671
And who are you?

259
00:25:54.178 --> 00:25:57.013
Peter, a humble pardoner...

260
00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.762
...and purveyor of religious relics.

261
00:26:01.477 --> 00:26:02.640
How much does he owe?

262
00:26:03.187 --> 00:26:05.760
Ten gold florins.

263
00:26:07.024 --> 00:26:08.767
You manky git!

264
00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:13.232
-Pain! Pain! Take the pain!
-Get him off me!

265
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.322
Wat, let him go!

266
00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:28.583
What would you do to him
if I was to refuse?

267
00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:33.755
We, on behalf of the Lord God...

268
00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:38.718
...will take it from his flesh
so that he may understand...

269
00:26:38.972 --> 00:26:41.427
...that gambling is a sin.

270
00:26:45.061 --> 00:26:46.436
Oh, come on.

271
00:26:47.438 --> 00:26:48.766
Please, Will.

272
00:26:52.234 --> 00:26:55.069
Please, will you help me,
Sir Ulrich?

273
00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.903
I promise you won't regret it.

274
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.319
I don't have the money.

275
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.292
Release him...

276
00:27:11.086 --> 00:27:13.755
...and give him back his clothes.

277
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:17.292
And you'll get it.

278
00:27:17.842 --> 00:27:18.791
Done.

279
00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:24.428
You lied.

280
00:27:24.808 --> 00:27:29.469
Yes, I lied. I'm a writer.
I give the truth scope!

281
00:27:29.938 --> 00:27:33.769
Behold my Lord
Ulrich von Lichtenstein, son of--

282
00:27:34.108 --> 00:27:36.646
-Too late. He's been announced.
-Fine.

283
00:27:36.944 --> 00:27:40.527
Ten blows by sword.
Sir Ulrich to receive first.

284
00:27:47.454 --> 00:27:48.450
Strike!

285
00:27:57.422 --> 00:27:58.537
Strike!

286
00:27:58.757 --> 00:28:00.132
Stop letting him hit you!

287
00:28:00.342 --> 00:28:02.334
Shut up! Shut up!

288
00:28:03.804 --> 00:28:06.970
Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring!

289
00:28:07.307 --> 00:28:09.465
Sir Ulrich to strike!

290
00:28:10.268 --> 00:28:12.012
-Now it's your turn!
-Come on!

291
00:28:25.533 --> 00:28:26.861
Strike!

292
00:28:29.203 --> 00:28:30.863
I taught him that!
That's me!

293
00:28:31.664 --> 00:28:34.867
Sir Ulrich prevails,
five strikes to two!

294
00:28:36.502 --> 00:28:37.617
Yes!

295
00:28:37.878 --> 00:28:42.670
Behold my Lord Ulrich!
The rock! The hard place!

296
00:28:42.883 --> 00:28:45.837
Like a wind from Gelderland,
he sweeps by!

297
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.169
Blown far from his homeland
in search of glory and honor!

298
00:28:50.515 --> 00:28:54.893
We walk in the garden
of his turbulence!

299
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.484
Yeah!

300
00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:32.485
-You're champion.
-Of the sword.

301
00:30:32.739 --> 00:30:34.981
lsn't that why we're here? Come on.

302
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.616
Do you want to touch him?
Do you want to touch him?

303
00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.918
We should've saved
for the blacksmith.

304
00:30:58.139 --> 00:30:59.514
I can't pay you now...

305
00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:03.306
-...but I promise I will, just as..
-No! Money.

306
00:31:07.148 --> 00:31:11.311
-Excuse me.
-Cash first, not promises.

307
00:31:11.986 --> 00:31:13.610
Go on.

308
00:31:15.698 --> 00:31:17.358
Excuse me, sir.

309
00:31:18.367 --> 00:31:20.656
You might try the farris.

310
00:31:21.995 --> 00:31:23.324
A woman?

311
00:31:23.705 --> 00:31:26.706
Beggars cannot be choosers, my lord.

312
00:31:29.503 --> 00:31:30.878
Thank you.

313
00:31:32.214 --> 00:31:35.131
-Excuse me.
-I don't work for free.

314
00:31:35.342 --> 00:31:39.553
-I can't joust with broken armor.
-That's your problem, not mine.

315
00:31:40.513 --> 00:31:43.467
Each drop of this sweat
has a price on it.

316
00:31:46.352 --> 00:31:49.721
Just as well. They told me
I was daft to even ask.

317
00:31:50.815 --> 00:31:53.851
-Who?
-The other armorers.

318
00:31:57.154 --> 00:31:59.942
Did they say I couldn't do it
because I'm a woman?

319
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.487
They said you're good
with horseshoes, not armor.

320
00:32:03.744 --> 00:32:06.116
No one mentioned you being a woman.

321
00:32:10.209 --> 00:32:11.869
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

322
00:32:12.378 --> 00:32:14.370
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

323
00:32:30.729 --> 00:32:33.765
Lady, I will win
this tournament for you.

324
00:32:33.982 --> 00:32:35.974
Nay! I will win for you.

325
00:32:36.234 --> 00:32:37.977
May I present Count Adhemar...

326
00:32:38.194 --> 00:32:42.061
...winner of the joust in France
and champion at Saint-Emilion.

327
00:32:44.742 --> 00:32:49.737
All forgotten when standing before the
most beautiful woman in Christendom.

328
00:32:55.085 --> 00:33:00.080
Do you only pretend to fight, Count
Adhemar, or wage real war as well?

329
00:33:01.091 --> 00:33:05.919
I am leader of the free companies.
My army is in southern France.

330
00:33:08.265 --> 00:33:10.970
Geoff, 'tis my lady.

331
00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:15.765
-William, you aim too high.
-I don't know any other way to aim.

332
00:33:16.106 --> 00:33:19.309
-Concentrate.
-What should I say to her?

333
00:33:27.992 --> 00:33:29.652
What do you think of the joust?

334
00:33:30.328 --> 00:33:32.155
It's very abrupt.

335
00:33:32.872 --> 00:33:35.328
And I don't understand the rules.

336
00:33:36.209 --> 00:33:38.000
Then I shall educate you.

337
00:33:39.003 --> 00:33:41.838
A match is three lances.

338
00:33:43.007 --> 00:33:47.799
One point is given for breaking
a lance between the waist and neck.

339
00:33:48.012 --> 00:33:51.178
Two points for breaking on the helmet.
It's difficult.

340
00:33:51.515 --> 00:33:55.513
The helmet sweeps back.
Most blows glance off.

341
00:33:55.894 --> 00:33:59.429
Three points for bearing a rider
to the ground.

342
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.023
Also, if you bear a rider
to the ground, you win his horse.

343
00:34:03.694 --> 00:34:05.686
Do men die in the joust?

344
00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:09.480
Lance points are tipped
with coronals, which blunts them.

345
00:34:10.033 --> 00:34:12.868
Of course, accidents happen.

346
00:34:14.371 --> 00:34:17.241
I myself, Jocelyn,
have never been unhorsed.

347
00:34:18.374 --> 00:34:20.034
Nor have I.

348
00:34:22.795 --> 00:34:24.124
Your name, lady.

349
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.504
I still need to hear it.

350
00:34:27.383 --> 00:34:29.625
Sir Hunter, you persist.

351
00:34:30.052 --> 00:34:33.753
Perhaps angels have no names.
Only beautiful faces.

352
00:34:37.143 --> 00:34:38.471
And you are?

353
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:41.051
I am, um....

354
00:34:41.313 --> 00:34:42.594
Have you forgotten?

355
00:34:42.856 --> 00:34:44.730
Or your name is Sir '' Um.''

356
00:34:46.235 --> 00:34:49.401
Ulrich von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

357
00:34:49.738 --> 00:34:52.276
I'd forget as well. What a mouthful.

358
00:34:52.991 --> 00:34:55.661
-Your armor, sir.
-What about it?

359
00:34:56.078 --> 00:35:00.905
How stylish of you to wear an antique.
You'll start a new fashion if you win.

360
00:35:01.249 --> 00:35:04.618
My grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again.

361
00:35:05.253 --> 00:35:08.088
And a shield. How quaint.

362
00:35:18.099 --> 00:35:22.844
Some of these poor country knights,
little better than peasants.

363
00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.474
--the second son...

364
00:35:25.815 --> 00:35:29.433
...of Sir Wallace Percival,
third Earl of Warwick.

365
00:35:29.819 --> 00:35:32.440
My lords, my ladies...

366
00:35:32.655 --> 00:35:36.273
...it is with honor
I introduce my liege...

367
00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:38.783
...Sir Thomas Colville.

368
00:35:46.126 --> 00:35:47.620
You're good.

369
00:35:48.795 --> 00:35:50.289
You're very good.

370
00:35:51.673 --> 00:35:53.132
My lords...

371
00:35:53.842 --> 00:35:55.336
...my ladies...

372
00:35:59.013 --> 00:36:02.678
...and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion...

373
00:36:09.816 --> 00:36:11.476
...today...

374
00:36:13.152 --> 00:36:15.228
...you find yourselves equals.

375
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:26.321
For you are all equally blessed.

376
00:36:27.499 --> 00:36:29.825
For I have the pride...

377
00:36:30.711 --> 00:36:32.999
...the privilege, nay, the pleasure...

378
00:36:34.006 --> 00:36:38.335
...of introducing to you
a knight sired by knights.

379
00:36:38.719 --> 00:36:42.087
A knight who can trace
his lineage back...

380
00:36:42.889 --> 00:36:45.012
...beyond Charlemagne.

381
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.803
I first met him...

382
00:36:49.062 --> 00:36:51.268
...atop a mountain near Jerusalem...

383
00:36:51.564 --> 00:36:53.687
...praying to God...

384
00:36:54.192 --> 00:36:57.525
...asking his forgiveness
for the Saracen blood...

385
00:36:57.862 --> 00:36:59.771
...spilt by his sword.

386
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:03.151
Next, he amazed me
still further in ltaly...

387
00:37:03.367 --> 00:37:05.574
...when he saved a fatherless
beauty...

388
00:37:05.828 --> 00:37:09.446
...from the would-be ravishings
of her dreadful uncle.

389
00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:18.714
In Greece...

390
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.420
...he spent a year in silence...

391
00:37:24.221 --> 00:37:27.388
...just to better understand
the sound...

392
00:37:29.935 --> 00:37:31.559
...of a whisper.

393
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:41.727
So without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado...

394
00:37:42.113 --> 00:37:44.735
...I give to you
the Seeker of Serenity...

395
00:37:45.074 --> 00:37:47.744
...Protector of Italian Virginity...

396
00:37:48.077 --> 00:37:52.905
...the Enforcer of our Lord God,
the one, the only...

397
00:37:53.249 --> 00:37:57.247
...Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

398
00:38:10.474 --> 00:38:13.759
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll be here all week.

399
00:38:20.859 --> 00:38:22.104
That was different.

400
00:38:22.319 --> 00:38:24.477
It's time we celebrated
our differences.

401
00:38:24.696 --> 00:38:26.689
Just maybe not in public.

402
00:38:27.699 --> 00:38:28.778
You....

403
00:38:29.159 --> 00:38:32.777
Yes, I'm well aware
a good fonging is on the way.

404
00:38:33.163 --> 00:38:34.954
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

405
00:38:35.331 --> 00:38:38.416
I got their attention.
You win their hearts.

406
00:38:59.647 --> 00:39:00.975
Very good.

407
00:39:01.357 --> 00:39:03.148
-Was she watching? Geoff.
-What?

408
00:39:03.525 --> 00:39:05.518
-Did she see me?
-Yes, she did.

409
00:39:05.819 --> 00:39:07.978
-Did she see me take the hit?
-Yes.

410
00:39:08.238 --> 00:39:11.239
-Was she concerned?
-Her eyes welled up. Just awful.

411
00:39:26.172 --> 00:39:30.004
Colville has perfect technique.
I've never seen him before.

412
00:39:30.343 --> 00:39:31.671
Nor I.

413
00:39:32.011 --> 00:39:33.920
But this Lichtenstein.

414
00:39:34.222 --> 00:39:37.306
His technique, rudimentary.
Style, nonexistent.

415
00:39:37.517 --> 00:39:40.054
Still, he's fearless.

416
00:39:41.354 --> 00:39:43.393
Fearless? How so?

417
00:39:43.689 --> 00:39:47.557
The slit in the visor is narrow,
but splinters can penetrate it.

418
00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:50.813
Most knights raise their chins
at the last instant.

419
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:56.024
You lose sight of your opponent, but
protect your eyes. Ulrich doesn't.

420
00:39:56.744 --> 00:39:58.902
He keeps his eye on the target.

421
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.705
A true hunter.

422
00:40:11.716 --> 00:40:13.258
Sir Ulrich...

423
00:40:15.053 --> 00:40:16.049
...I'm through.

424
00:40:17.222 --> 00:40:20.591
But I've never not finished before.

425
00:40:21.392 --> 00:40:24.927
I wish to keep my honor intact.

426
00:40:50.295 --> 00:40:52.584
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

427
00:41:01.306 --> 00:41:04.924
Colville withdraws. Ulrich advances.

428
00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:08.096
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

429
00:41:08.813 --> 00:41:10.640
He shows mercy.

430
00:41:12.442 --> 00:41:16.605
Then he shows his weakness.
That's all mercy is.

431
00:41:21.367 --> 00:41:24.451
For the love of victory, William,
go to sleep.

432
00:41:27.665 --> 00:41:28.945
I can't.

433
00:41:31.127 --> 00:41:34.127
Love has given me wings,
so I must fly.

434
00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.548
I can't explain it.

435
00:41:40.469 --> 00:41:44.169
-She makes me feel like a poet.
-You may feel like a poet...

436
00:41:44.389 --> 00:41:46.049
...but you sound like an idiot.

437
00:41:46.266 --> 00:41:49.184
-You don't even know her name.
-Her name?

438
00:41:50.979 --> 00:41:53.351
Her name is Aphrodite.

439
00:41:53.815 --> 00:41:57.314
Calypso. Venus. Take your pick.

440
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.362
Women weaken the heart.

441
00:42:05.868 --> 00:42:08.490
Without your heart, you cannot win.

442
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.576
-But her eyes--
-Concentrate.

443
00:42:14.835 --> 00:42:16.378
Tansy cakes!

444
00:42:19.173 --> 00:42:21.545
Count Adhemar sends word.

445
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:26.003
He said he will win
this tournament for you.

446
00:42:26.889 --> 00:42:31.052
He's won many. He wins them
for himself and his own honor.

447
00:42:31.268 --> 00:42:33.676
It's nothing to say
he wins them for me.

448
00:42:35.689 --> 00:42:37.847
He wishes to speak to you again.

449
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.476
Not to hear a word I say.

450
00:42:41.737 --> 00:42:44.109
Adhemar wants his women silent.

451
00:42:49.869 --> 00:42:53.119
Would you have Sir Ulrich
win the tournament for you?

452
00:42:53.373 --> 00:42:54.701
No.

453
00:42:55.917 --> 00:42:59.202
And he is the only knight
who has not promised to do so.

454
00:43:01.047 --> 00:43:03.752
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

455
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.041
I would have him win my heart.

456
00:43:15.895 --> 00:43:19.394
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

457
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:25.229
Oh, lovely.

458
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.779
I don't think I've ever seen
Count Adhemar lose.

459
00:43:30.242 --> 00:43:33.243
No, but defeat him
and you'll see it firsthand.

460
00:43:34.913 --> 00:43:36.407
My liege.

461
00:43:38.083 --> 00:43:39.577
Sir Ulrich.

462
00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:42.961
Christiana.

463
00:43:43.588 --> 00:43:47.586
-My lady bids you wear this token.
-Of course.

464
00:43:48.301 --> 00:43:50.922
She also said to tell you, her name...

465
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.757
...is Jocelyn.

466
00:43:57.518 --> 00:43:59.012
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

467
00:44:00.896 --> 00:44:02.177
Oh, Jocelyn.

468
00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:07.269
Concentrate.

469
00:45:29.858 --> 00:45:31.352
I can't breathe.

470
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.074
No style whatsoever.

471
00:45:42.536 --> 00:45:44.363
But neither has an anvil.

472
00:45:45.373 --> 00:45:49.702
-He hits like a hammer. Amazing.
-But not perfect. He aims high.

473
00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.712
Roll your shoulder back,
his blow may go right.

474
00:45:52.963 --> 00:45:55.964
But if he strikes to my left,
I'll be obliterated.

475
00:45:56.508 --> 00:45:58.300
I didn't say it wasn't a gamble.

476
00:46:38.924 --> 00:46:42.625
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

477
00:47:34.144 --> 00:47:35.473
William?

478
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.814
William, here.

479
00:47:46.323 --> 00:47:47.651
Come here.

480
00:47:56.708 --> 00:47:59.163
Someday I'll be a knight.

481
00:48:00.712 --> 00:48:03.001
A thatcher's son? A knight?

482
00:48:03.339 --> 00:48:06.174
You might as well try
to change the stars.

483
00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:09.879
Can it be done, Father?

484
00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:13.679
-Can a man change the stars?
-Yes, William.

485
00:48:13.975 --> 00:48:16.929
If he believes enough,
a man can do anything.

486
00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:38.080
Come here.

487
00:48:45.547 --> 00:48:48.038
Gain more bearing, Ulrich.

488
00:48:48.758 --> 00:48:50.751
See me again when you're worthy.

489
00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.926
I'll fong you in the arse!

490
00:48:59.227 --> 00:49:01.932
Well done, my lord! Well done.

491
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:04.518
-You bastard!
-Go and see to Ulrich.

492
00:49:04.732 --> 00:49:06.559
Go see to Ulrich.

493
00:49:10.279 --> 00:49:11.904
Well done, my lord.

494
00:49:12.448 --> 00:49:14.072
A noble victory.

495
00:49:19.246 --> 00:49:22.781
My lady, I believe this is yours.

496
00:49:29.131 --> 00:49:31.752
For long spear on foot...

497
00:49:32.134 --> 00:49:34.625
...Pandolfo Malatesta.

498
00:49:39.766 --> 00:49:44.143
For sword on foot,
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

499
00:49:48.816 --> 00:49:53.609
Finally, for the mounted joust
and tournament champion...

500
00:49:53.946 --> 00:49:56.781
...Adhemar, Count of Anjou.

501
00:49:58.451 --> 00:50:01.321
Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!

502
00:50:03.956 --> 00:50:08.001
I present to you your champions.

503
00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.466
Next time, you will look up
at me from the flat of your back.

504
00:50:17.678 --> 00:50:21.722
Please. You have been weighed,
you have been measured...

505
00:50:21.974 --> 00:50:23.966
...and you have been found wanting.

506
00:50:31.983 --> 00:50:33.940
Keep winning the sword.

507
00:50:34.194 --> 00:50:36.566
-I won't compete in it.
-It's your best.

508
00:50:36.863 --> 00:50:39.484
No. It's tournament champion
or nothing at all.

509
00:50:44.996 --> 00:50:47.534
Ten florins. That should do.

510
00:50:50.376 --> 00:50:53.994
Sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.
Do you feel lucky?

511
00:50:54.338 --> 00:50:58.502
-Have you enough clothes?
-Be gone. I'm done with you.

512
00:50:59.343 --> 00:51:01.881
Except to exact my revenge.

513
00:51:04.348 --> 00:51:07.847
What on earth could you
possibly do to us?

514
00:51:08.227 --> 00:51:10.515
I will eviscerate you in fiction.

515
00:51:10.854 --> 00:51:14.188
Every last pimple,
every last character flaw.

516
00:51:14.566 --> 00:51:18.895
I was naked for a day.
You will be naked for eternity.

517
00:51:19.696 --> 00:51:22.187
I have a feeling we shall meet again.

518
00:51:25.035 --> 00:51:27.704
Here, farris, take what we owe you.

519
00:51:28.705 --> 00:51:32.868
The armor you wear, it wasn't
made for you, was it?

520
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.419
So, what of it?

521
00:51:35.586 --> 00:51:38.540
I could make armor you wouldn't
even know you wore it.

522
00:51:38.798 --> 00:51:40.126
What's the cost?

523
00:51:41.717 --> 00:51:43.924
Just take me as far as Paris.

524
00:51:44.971 --> 00:51:47.841
We travel alone.
Take your gold and go.

525
00:51:56.273 --> 00:52:00.734
-Get what you can. Let's pack.
-Why are we leaving so soon?

526
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:06.064
The next tournament is in a week.
We can walk now and save the horse.

527
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.819
You must go to the banquet.
You'll dance and make an appearance.

528
00:52:10.078 --> 00:52:12.237
Let Adhemar laugh at me again?
No!

529
00:52:12.497 --> 00:52:14.490
-Yes!
-No!

530
00:52:20.755 --> 00:52:24.290
My lady would know the color
of your lord's tunic tonight.

531
00:52:24.926 --> 00:52:29.089
-His tunic?
-Yes, so she can dress to match him.

532
00:52:29.472 --> 00:52:33.007
We regret to inform your lady
he won't be attending--

533
00:52:33.267 --> 00:52:36.802
-Herald, do not give my answers!
-Yes, my lord.

534
00:52:37.021 --> 00:52:38.598
Squire, answer her.

535
00:52:38.981 --> 00:52:42.599
What color is my tunic tonight?

536
00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.156
Green.

537
00:52:50.325 --> 00:52:52.033
Trimmed in a kind of...

538
00:52:52.327 --> 00:52:54.119
...pale green...

539
00:52:55.956 --> 00:52:57.284
...with...

540
00:52:57.666 --> 00:52:59.789
...uh, wooden toggles.

541
00:53:01.461 --> 00:53:03.288
I will tell my lady.

542
00:53:09.803 --> 00:53:13.586
-This is a disaster!
-No, it'll tunic up quite nicely.

543
00:53:13.806 --> 00:53:15.799
That's not a disaster, Roland.

544
00:53:19.687 --> 00:53:21.312
I don't know how to dance.

545
00:53:23.816 --> 00:53:27.481
And one and two and three and four.

546
00:53:27.862 --> 00:53:31.147
Your hand should be light,
like a birdie on a branch.

547
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:34.989
And one, two and three and four.

548
00:53:35.327 --> 00:53:38.494
And Wat doesn't lead,
he follows like a girl.

549
00:53:48.507 --> 00:53:51.673
And one and two and...

550
00:53:52.052 --> 00:53:53.676
...twirly, twirly, twirly.

551
00:53:54.054 --> 00:53:57.173
And one and two, and you're
still getting it wrong.

552
00:53:57.515 --> 00:54:01.216
And one and two
and three and four.

553
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:04.847
You can hit me all day
because you punch like a what?

554
00:54:05.106 --> 00:54:06.387
A girl.

555
00:54:06.691 --> 00:54:08.684
-Enough!
-Get back! Wat, quiet!

556
00:54:09.235 --> 00:54:11.192
-He starts it.
-You know he's touchy!

557
00:54:13.739 --> 00:54:15.732
Oh, and you can do better?

558
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.071
-Of course.
-Then show us.

559
00:54:20.162 --> 00:54:21.704
No.

560
00:54:23.374 --> 00:54:27.952
If I'm making all this effort,
you'd best ask her nicely.

561
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:33.664
I'm sorry, Kate.

562
00:54:37.888 --> 00:54:41.885
I was wondering if you'd care
to show us how to dance.

563
00:54:43.018 --> 00:54:44.180
-Please.
-Please.

564
00:54:47.564 --> 00:54:51.063
And one and two, three and four.

565
00:54:51.443 --> 00:54:54.443
Five, six, seven, change partners.

566
00:54:54.738 --> 00:54:58.071
And one, two, three, four...

567
00:54:58.408 --> 00:55:00.863
...five, six, seven.

568
00:55:01.119 --> 00:55:02.945
Polonaise. And one....

569
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.237
Are you wearing your hair like that?

570
00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:09.076
Is there another way?

571
00:55:38.155 --> 00:55:42.104
Sir Ulrich, you look fantastic.

572
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.242
Jocelyn, you look....

573
00:55:49.832 --> 00:55:51.161
Uh, you...

574
00:55:54.587 --> 00:55:56.081
...remind me of the Bible.

575
00:56:01.761 --> 00:56:06.138
When God stopped the sun to give
Joshua time to defeat the Amorites.

576
00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:11.139
I don't understand.

577
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:18.854
If I could ask God one thing...

578
00:56:19.486 --> 00:56:21.775
...it would be to stop the moon.

579
00:56:23.657 --> 00:56:26.527
Stop the moon and make this night...

580
00:56:27.828 --> 00:56:29.488
...and your beauty...

581
00:56:30.163 --> 00:56:31.871
...last forever.

582
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.334
What dance will you have? A coranto?

583
00:56:38.338 --> 00:56:40.330
Or a basse dance?

584
00:56:41.341 --> 00:56:42.883
Sir Ulrich.

585
00:56:44.677 --> 00:56:47.797
Why don't you show us a dance
of your country?

586
00:56:48.556 --> 00:56:50.845
Show us a dance of Gelderland.

587
00:56:52.852 --> 00:56:55.010
Yes. Gelderland.

588
00:56:59.191 --> 00:57:02.026
Well, it's a lot like the farandole...

589
00:57:03.362 --> 00:57:06.197
...but with some differences.

590
00:57:07.366 --> 00:57:09.358
Well, you bow.

591
00:57:13.705 --> 00:57:15.247
And...

592
00:57:27.385 --> 00:57:28.548
...and....

593
00:57:42.608 --> 00:57:44.731
Places. Places.

594
01:00:54.419 --> 01:00:55.581
What?

595
01:00:56.921 --> 01:01:02.260
-I don't know. Too small, too light.
-He'll be crushed. Killed.

596
01:01:02.593 --> 01:01:07.220
No. I found a new way to heat steel.
It's thinner, smaller...

597
01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:09.091
...but just as strong.

598
01:01:09.392 --> 01:01:10.554
What are these?

599
01:01:10.935 --> 01:01:14.600
The marks of my trade should
another knight admire the armor.

600
01:01:17.149 --> 01:01:20.435
Twist and bend. Feel the movement.

601
01:01:22.071 --> 01:01:25.440
-But eventually I will be struck.
-And then death.

602
01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:28.821
Do you at least have the courage
to test it?

603
01:01:38.253 --> 01:01:39.249
You okay?

604
01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:42.457
I didn't feel a thing.

605
01:02:09.533 --> 01:02:12.487
-Who's that knight?
-Piers Courtenay.

606
01:02:12.786 --> 01:02:16.998
He's raised taxes on his land 3 times
this year to pay for tournament.

607
01:02:17.207 --> 01:02:20.042
His people starve while
he sits at banquet.

608
01:02:23.755 --> 01:02:25.463
It's probably true.

609
01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.825
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

610
01:03:03.377 --> 01:03:05.998
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

611
01:03:07.423 --> 01:03:09.000
The Count Adhemar...

612
01:03:09.675 --> 01:03:11.714
...son of Philippe de Vitry...

613
01:03:12.052 --> 01:03:14.210
...son of Gilles...

614
01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.674
...master of the free companies...

615
01:03:17.265 --> 01:03:20.136
...defender of his enormous manhood...

616
01:03:20.852 --> 01:03:23.390
...a shining example of chivalry...

617
01:03:23.688 --> 01:03:25.562
...and champagne.

618
01:03:30.028 --> 01:03:31.570
Nice work!

619
01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:34.359
Bravo!

620
01:03:37.827 --> 01:03:40.994
Watch every move Adhemar makes.
We'll find a weakness.

621
01:03:41.205 --> 01:03:42.865
Well, Colville looks fit.

622
01:03:43.207 --> 01:03:44.370
--my liege...

623
01:03:44.584 --> 01:03:47.371
...the second son of
Sir Wallace Percival.

624
01:03:47.586 --> 01:03:50.374
It is my deepest honor--

625
01:03:53.884 --> 01:03:56.126
My deepest honor to present to you....

626
01:03:56.929 --> 01:03:59.883
It's Edward, my lord.
They're sure of it.

627
01:04:02.935 --> 01:04:06.386
--the illustrious Sir Thomas Colville!

628
01:04:22.245 --> 01:04:23.905
Adhemar withdrew.

629
01:04:24.247 --> 01:04:26.785
To withdraw like that means one thing.

630
01:04:27.959 --> 01:04:29.073
Royalty.

631
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:41.463
I'll see what I can find out.

632
01:04:43.265 --> 01:04:44.973
Prepare to drop the flag.

633
01:04:45.184 --> 01:04:48.019
No, no. Not yet. Wait, listen.

634
01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:49.930
Musicians, announce.

635
01:04:50.189 --> 01:04:53.640
-I must speak with my lord.
-Then go.

636
01:04:53.901 --> 01:04:56.439
See if you can beat the Second Coming.

637
01:04:57.446 --> 01:04:59.106
Wait! Wait!

638
01:05:00.866 --> 01:05:05.326
Colville is Edward, the Black
Prince, future king of England.

639
01:05:05.662 --> 01:05:07.951
He's in disguise like me
so he can compete.

640
01:05:08.164 --> 01:05:11.948
He's never met an enemy without
victory or town he couldn't defeat.

641
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:14.203
We're English! We know who he is!

642
01:05:14.462 --> 01:05:17.831
-You must withdraw. Tell them, Geoff.
-Absolutely!

643
01:05:18.091 --> 01:05:19.004
The lance.

644
01:05:26.474 --> 01:05:27.802
Give me the lance.

645
01:05:35.316 --> 01:05:36.478
Lance!

646
01:05:50.664 --> 01:05:52.822
Oh, my giddy aunt.

647
01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:59.708
The match is a draw.

648
01:06:02.884 --> 01:06:05.422
You mad? You endanger
a royal family member.

649
01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.886
He endangers himself.

650
01:06:08.681 --> 01:06:11.172
Well fought, Sir Ulrich, as in Rouen.

651
01:06:13.186 --> 01:06:14.929
You also, Prince Edward.

652
01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:22.518
-You knew me?
-Yeah.

653
01:06:26.532 --> 01:06:27.730
And still you rode?

654
01:06:28.909 --> 01:06:32.907
-It's not in me to withdraw.
-No. Nor me.

655
01:06:35.457 --> 01:06:37.165
Though it happens.

656
01:06:39.545 --> 01:06:41.252
Yes, it does.

657
01:06:43.215 --> 01:06:46.381
-Good luck to you.
-You also.

658
01:06:48.929 --> 01:06:53.092
The winner of the mounted joust and
tournament champion...

659
01:06:53.391 --> 01:06:55.633
...Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

660
01:07:01.733 --> 01:07:05.066
-Melt it, sell it, do whatever you do.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

661
01:07:05.361 --> 01:07:06.524
You're champion!

662
01:07:06.738 --> 01:07:09.774
I'm not champion until
I defeat Adhemar. He withdrew.

663
01:07:10.074 --> 01:07:11.402
Sir Ulrich.

664
01:07:12.743 --> 01:07:16.575
-Tell me what you'll wear tonight.
-Nothing.

665
01:07:16.956 --> 01:07:19.743
We'll cause a sensation,
for I'll dress to match.

666
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.538
Don't you get tired
of putting on clothes?

667
01:07:22.753 --> 01:07:25.244
She's talking about taking them off.

668
01:07:27.132 --> 01:07:30.086
A flower is only as good
as its petals, no?

669
01:07:30.469 --> 01:07:32.093
A flower is good for nothing.

670
01:07:34.598 --> 01:07:35.796
Really?

671
01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.636
You can't eat a flower.
lt doesn't keep you warm.

672
01:07:39.895 --> 01:07:43.346
And a rose never knocked
a man off a horse either, did it?

673
01:07:45.692 --> 01:07:48.397
You're just a silly girl, aren't you?

674
01:07:51.614 --> 01:07:56.490
Better a silly girl with a flower than
a silly boy with a horse and stick.

675
01:08:01.123 --> 01:08:02.452
Goodbye.

676
01:08:06.629 --> 01:08:08.621
It's called a lance.

677
01:08:09.006 --> 01:08:10.465
Hello.

678
01:08:41.996 --> 01:08:43.656
-I have word.
-What?

679
01:08:43.998 --> 01:08:46.833
Adhemar was called back
to the free companies.

680
01:08:47.168 --> 01:08:50.085
Edward commanded it.
He could be gone all season.

681
01:08:51.172 --> 01:08:54.007
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

682
01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.055
Well done.

683
01:09:01.348 --> 01:09:03.507
Yeah, well done.

684
01:09:14.194 --> 01:09:16.519
The tournament results, my lord.

685
01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:30.705
Ulrich.

686
01:09:31.544 --> 01:09:32.873
Ulrich.

687
01:09:33.713 --> 01:09:34.876
Ulrich.

688
01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.062
-Geoff.
-William.

689
01:09:55.901 --> 01:09:57.561
I need to write a letter.

690
01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:00.823
'' Dear Jocelyn.'' No.
'' My dearest Jocelyn.''

691
01:10:01.115 --> 01:10:02.490
Better.

692
01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:07.324
'' I miss you.''

693
01:10:08.497 --> 01:10:09.955
Was that wrong?

694
01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:14.827
Well, it's up to you, really.
It's your funeral, I mean, letter.

695
01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:18.756
-Say something about her breasts.
-You miss them.

696
01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:20.622
Her breasts?

697
01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:26.837
Yes, you could, but I would tend
to look above her breasts.

698
01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:29.974
I miss her throat?

699
01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:32.510
Still higher. Towards the heavens.

700
01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:35.605
The moon. Her breasts
weren't that impressive.

701
01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.105
The moon? The moon.

702
01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:43.319
'' lt is strange to think...

703
01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:47.107
...I have not seen you in a month.

704
01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:53.120
I have seen the new moon, but not you.

705
01:10:55.292 --> 01:11:00.001
I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but
nothing of your beautiful face.''

706
01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:06.293
That's very good.

707
01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:09.634
I knew this girl once who....

708
01:11:10.974 --> 01:11:13.299
She broke my heart.
I said the pieces--

709
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:18.221
''The pieces of my broken heart can
pass through the eye of a needle. ''

710
01:11:21.317 --> 01:11:23.393
He writes as though I had died.

711
01:11:23.653 --> 01:11:26.654
Yes, madame. He dies as well.

712
01:11:28.324 --> 01:11:30.993
She used to cook for the Duke of York.

713
01:11:33.996 --> 01:11:37.365
I miss her like the sun
misses the flower.

714
01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:40.834
''I miss you like the sun
misses the flower.

715
01:11:41.545 --> 01:11:45.163
Like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter.

716
01:11:46.842 --> 01:11:50.045
Instead of beauty to direct
its light to...

717
01:11:50.679 --> 01:11:55.222
...the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has sent me to.''

718
01:11:55.517 --> 01:11:57.510
''I next compete in Paris.

719
01:11:58.562 --> 01:12:01.681
I'll find it empty and cold
if you're not there.''

720
01:12:02.857 --> 01:12:04.352
I like it.

721
01:12:05.193 --> 01:12:07.351
And now, to finish it.

722
01:12:08.738 --> 01:12:10.363
With '' hope.''

723
01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:13.357
Love should end with hope.

724
01:12:14.702 --> 01:12:17.537
My husband, God rest him...

725
01:12:17.955 --> 01:12:20.197
...said something I'll never forget.

726
01:12:22.043 --> 01:12:23.537
'' Hope guides me. lt--''

727
01:12:23.794 --> 01:12:27.294
''It gets me through the day and
especially the night.

728
01:12:28.382 --> 01:12:30.873
The hope that after you
leave my sight...

729
01:12:31.135 --> 01:12:33.922
...it will not be the last time
I look upon you.''

730
01:12:37.724 --> 01:12:39.432
Finish it with.:

731
01:12:40.102 --> 01:12:44.313
''With all the love
that I possess...William.''

732
01:12:45.774 --> 01:12:46.853
You mean '' Ulrich.''

733
01:12:49.319 --> 01:12:51.608
''With all the love I possess...

734
01:12:53.281 --> 01:12:55.108
...I remain yours...

735
01:12:55.992 --> 01:12:57.985
...the knight of your heart.''

736
01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:11.124
My master hoped you might have
something to send him in return.

737
01:13:25.938 --> 01:13:30.730
Cock-a-doodle once! I shall not deny
him. Twice! I shall not. Thrice!

738
01:13:31.527 --> 01:13:33.104
I deny him.

739
01:13:33.528 --> 01:13:34.904
Thrice he denied him!

740
01:13:40.994 --> 01:13:42.536
No Adhemar.

741
01:13:44.205 --> 01:13:45.404
No Adhemar.

742
01:13:51.087 --> 01:13:52.250
Wat.

743
01:13:55.383 --> 01:13:58.419
Tell me, did you see her?
Did she read the letter?

744
01:13:58.845 --> 01:14:00.837
Yes, and yes.

745
01:14:01.764 --> 01:14:02.713
And?

746
01:14:08.813 --> 01:14:10.271
She's coming to Paris!

747
01:14:13.901 --> 01:14:18.527
Did she give you anything for me in
return? A letter? A token?

748
01:14:19.156 --> 01:14:21.398
Did she give me a token? She did.

749
01:14:23.785 --> 01:14:25.114
Uh, I mean, um....

750
01:14:25.704 --> 01:14:28.409
Well, what is it? Give it to me.

751
01:14:37.215 --> 01:14:38.543
Yes!

752
01:14:40.927 --> 01:14:42.552
Hell, yes!

753
01:14:43.888 --> 01:14:47.720
She-- Because she's--
That means she-- Yeah!

754
01:14:51.562 --> 01:14:52.938
Cinquante.

755
01:14:54.065 --> 01:14:55.689
That's a nice round number.

756
01:14:56.442 --> 01:14:57.640
Ex cusez-moi.

757
01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:05.610
They wager that a Frenchman, not
Sir Ulrich, will win the tournament.

758
01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:09.077
But the amount is 50 florins.

759
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:12.247
-That's all we got.
-lf we had 60, it would be that.

760
01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:14.948
Ulrich against every Frenchman here?

761
01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:18.911
He's won four tournaments in a row.
And Adhemar isn't here.

762
01:15:19.131 --> 01:15:22.131
I check shields too.
John Beaumont's here.

763
01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:26.002
Count Theobald, Philip of Burgundy--
all French champions.

764
01:15:26.263 --> 01:15:27.757
Englishmen will not win...

765
01:15:27.973 --> 01:15:29.764
...this French tournament.

766
01:15:30.141 --> 01:15:33.759
English legs are unsteady
on French soil.

767
01:15:36.272 --> 01:15:38.431
Shut your mouth, all right?

768
01:15:40.109 --> 01:15:44.486
Come on, Roland. It's a good bet.
Win and I can buy my own tavern.

769
01:15:44.822 --> 01:15:47.657
-I could write full-time.
-A forge for me.

770
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:52.446
And because French wine
is too much for English bellies.

771
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:57.741
Listen, I'm about this fonging close,
mate. I swear to God, Quasimodo!

772
01:15:58.335 --> 01:16:02.629
All I want is to go home, and I've
enough for that trip a hundred times.

773
01:16:02.965 --> 01:16:07.508
And most importantly, because
the pope himself is French!

774
01:16:10.138 --> 01:16:13.424
The pope may be French,
but Jesus is English. You're on.

775
01:16:14.476 --> 01:16:17.014
He won't lose with the princess
watching him.

776
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:19.263
He's blond! He's pissed!

777
01:16:19.481 --> 01:16:24.189
He'll see you in the lists!
Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein!

778
01:16:24.444 --> 01:16:27.979
He's blond! He's tan!
He comes from Gelderland!

779
01:16:28.364 --> 01:16:30.357
He comes from Gelderland!

780
01:16:30.658 --> 01:16:33.529
Gelderland!

781
01:16:49.009 --> 01:16:53.007
-You think he will come?
-As sure as the sun will rise.

782
01:17:18.705 --> 01:17:20.531
You favor cathedrals.

783
01:17:23.209 --> 01:17:25.083
I come for confession.

784
01:17:28.381 --> 01:17:30.373
And the glass.

785
01:17:31.217 --> 01:17:34.550
A riot of color in a dreary,
gray world.

786
01:17:35.721 --> 01:17:37.215
Don't you think?

787
01:17:38.265 --> 01:17:39.890
It's beautiful.

788
01:17:44.063 --> 01:17:46.898
I feel the same about
the letter you sent.

789
01:17:49.776 --> 01:17:51.401
Speak to me.

790
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:53.897
Speak those words.

791
01:17:56.116 --> 01:17:58.405
I will win this tournament for you.

792
01:17:59.202 --> 01:18:00.233
Excuse me?

793
01:18:00.453 --> 01:18:05.448
I'll win this tournament in your name.
I'll defeat each knight for you.

794
01:18:05.792 --> 01:18:10.750
Your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm and my horse's flanks.

795
01:18:11.798 --> 01:18:13.126
Wow.

796
01:18:14.258 --> 01:18:15.587
Really?

797
01:18:16.094 --> 01:18:18.419
Really? lts flanks?

798
01:18:21.766 --> 01:18:24.304
I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich.

799
01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:27.762
Well, I'm not ready.

800
01:18:29.648 --> 01:18:33.728
I am. Why must everything for
a woman be run on a man's schedule?

801
01:18:33.944 --> 01:18:37.443
Well, a man's day is fuller, and...

802
01:18:37.823 --> 01:18:40.824
...he has more demands on his time.

803
01:18:41.159 --> 01:18:43.152
-ls that so?
-Yes.

804
01:18:43.829 --> 01:18:44.991
Maybe.

805
01:18:46.331 --> 01:18:47.446
No?

806
01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:50.163
I demand poetry...

807
01:18:50.961 --> 01:18:53.630
...and when I want it.
And I want it now.

808
01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.294
Your breasts...

809
01:18:59.677 --> 01:19:02.133
...they're below your throat....

810
01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:07.469
Jocelyn, how may I prove
my love to you? How?

811
01:19:09.937 --> 01:19:13.472
-Do you ask in earnest?
-Yes.

812
01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:19.692
If you would prove your love...

813
01:19:20.364 --> 01:19:23.151
-...do your worst.
-My worst?

814
01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:26.155
What do you mean?

815
01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:31.489
Instead of winning to honor me
with your high reputation...

816
01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:34.662
...act against your character
and do badly.

817
01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.379
-Do badly?
-Lose.

818
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:38.622
Losing proves that I'm a loser.

819
01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.375
Wrong. Losing is a much keener
test of your love.

820
01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:45.168
Losing would contradict
your self-love.

821
01:19:45.555 --> 01:19:49.006
It would show obedience
to your lover and not yourself!

822
01:19:49.309 --> 01:19:51.716
-Really?
-Woman, shh!

823
01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:56.516
Do not ''shh'' me and spare him!
Now be gone! Go!

824
01:19:59.652 --> 01:20:00.933
What is your answer?

825
01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:06.857
I will not lose.

826
01:20:11.705 --> 01:20:13.365
Then you do not love me.

827
01:20:27.095 --> 01:20:29.135
The Protector of ltalian Virginity.

828
01:20:30.432 --> 01:20:33.219
The Lance that thrilled France...

829
01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.932
...the Harasser of Paraser!

830
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:38.898
He gave them hell at La Rochelle!

831
01:20:39.607 --> 01:20:42.395
The Enforcer of our Lord God!

832
01:20:43.278 --> 01:20:46.232
The one, the only...

833
01:20:47.115 --> 01:20:49.403
...Sir Ulrich...

834
01:20:49.742 --> 01:20:52.280
...von Lichtenstein!

835
01:20:59.043 --> 01:21:00.502
God, I'm good!

836
01:21:05.758 --> 01:21:08.046
His horse's flanks.

837
01:21:08.636 --> 01:21:11.636
Maybe where he comes from,
it means love.

838
01:21:23.608 --> 01:21:24.688
What are you doing?

839
01:21:25.068 --> 01:21:27.226
-Losing.
-I don't understand.

840
01:21:28.029 --> 01:21:29.061
Neither do l.

841
01:21:49.467 --> 01:21:51.009
He loves me.

842
01:21:54.096 --> 01:21:55.341
Are you blind?

843
01:21:56.265 --> 01:21:59.052
-Did you see the flag?
-I saw it, okay?

844
01:21:59.977 --> 01:22:01.601
I know.

845
01:22:01.979 --> 01:22:05.145
You're dropping behind
for a more dramatic victory.

846
01:22:07.442 --> 01:22:10.646
Look, Jocelyn told me to lose
to prove my love.

847
01:22:13.281 --> 01:22:16.068
-I'd rather you were blind.
-Don't be foolish, Will.

848
01:22:16.284 --> 01:22:20.448
-Each woman wants proof, that's all.
-Proof of what?

849
01:22:21.206 --> 01:22:23.412
Her legs weren't uncrossed
for nothing.

850
01:22:23.625 --> 01:22:28.121
-I haven't uncrossed her legs.
-Then why are we doing this?

851
01:22:28.463 --> 01:22:29.708
Because!

852
01:22:41.851 --> 01:22:43.226
Because...

853
01:22:44.812 --> 01:22:46.140
...I love her.

854
01:23:28.104 --> 01:23:31.971
-I'm going to lose everything!
-That's why it's called gambling.

855
01:23:33.192 --> 01:23:34.852
Pain! Here's your pain!

856
01:23:35.194 --> 01:23:37.352
It's very romantic, though.

857
01:23:37.905 --> 01:23:40.147
Are you a woman or a blacksmith?

858
01:23:40.533 --> 01:23:42.157
Sometimes I'm both.

859
01:23:42.368 --> 01:23:44.194
Ooh, that chafes!

860
01:23:44.536 --> 01:23:45.865
Put him down.

861
01:23:49.416 --> 01:23:52.370
No knight has distanced himself
with victories.

862
01:23:52.753 --> 01:23:57.379
If you win your remaining matches
and your opponents take key losses...

863
01:23:57.674 --> 01:24:00.165
...you could make the semis,
or the finals.

864
01:24:00.385 --> 01:24:04.169
-At least the armor's proven itself.
-And your love?

865
01:24:04.556 --> 01:24:06.762
Have you proven that yet?

866
01:24:09.561 --> 01:24:13.890
Wat, you remember church as a boy.
The fear, the passion.

867
01:24:14.899 --> 01:24:17.057
That's what she makes me feel.

868
01:24:17.902 --> 01:24:22.231
And for that, I say my rosary
to Jocelyn and no one else.

869
01:24:23.074 --> 01:24:25.565
William, that's blasphemous.

870
01:24:32.124 --> 01:24:33.915
Then may I burn in hell.

871
01:24:34.251 --> 01:24:35.449
Withdraw.

872
01:24:35.836 --> 01:24:38.078
Lose that way.
Take no more punishment.

873
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:40.255
Oh, Roland.

874
01:24:46.138 --> 01:24:49.423
My lady sends this message.
If you love her--

875
01:24:49.808 --> 01:24:53.141
I know, I know. I must lose.
Isn't she watching?

876
01:24:53.478 --> 01:24:56.432
She says if you love her,
you won't lose again.

877
01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.439
She says if you love her,
you will win this tournament.

878
01:25:09.994 --> 01:25:13.445
There she is, the embodiment of love.
Your Venus.

879
01:25:13.706 --> 01:25:15.117
And how I hate her.

880
01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:35.766
-I don't understand women.
-Nor do I, but they understand us.

881
01:25:37.312 --> 01:25:38.972
Maybe not you.

882
01:25:51.076 --> 01:25:52.486
Yes!

883
01:25:53.203 --> 01:25:54.697
Women, eh?

884
01:26:18.227 --> 01:26:19.887
Forty-eight...

885
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:21.604
...forty-nine...

886
01:26:21.897 --> 01:26:23.557
...and fifty.

887
01:26:23.857 --> 01:26:27.392
Thank you, gentlemen.
A pleasure doing business with you.

888
01:26:27.736 --> 01:26:31.520
Look us up if you're in London,
the World Championships, maybe.

889
01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:35.903
Don't look too sad.
Here, have a drink on me.

890
01:26:36.244 --> 01:26:41.202
He's quick, he's funny and
makes lots of money, Lichtenstein!

891
01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:01.633
Guinevere comes to Lancelot.

892
01:27:07.650 --> 01:27:09.642
Bed him well, my lady.

893
01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:11.652
Bed him well.

894
01:27:18.452 --> 01:27:20.160
We missed you at banquet.

895
01:27:21.747 --> 01:27:22.612
''We''?

896
01:27:27.335 --> 01:27:28.616
l.

897
01:27:30.130 --> 01:27:31.505
Jocelyn.

898
01:27:32.298 --> 01:27:33.958
Your prize.

899
01:27:35.969 --> 01:27:37.593
My prize.

900
01:27:39.847 --> 01:27:41.472
I am not worthy of a prize.

901
01:27:43.476 --> 01:27:45.184
Then who is?

902
01:27:46.813 --> 01:27:50.181
My maid tells me that
sometimes your varlets...

903
01:27:51.359 --> 01:27:52.639
...call you William.

904
01:27:56.155 --> 01:27:57.779
Is this so, Sir Ulrich?

905
01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:02.322
Yes.

906
01:28:04.163 --> 01:28:05.158
lt is so.

907
01:28:19.177 --> 01:28:22.012
Your name makes no matter to me.

908
01:28:24.015 --> 01:28:26.506
Just so I can call you my own.

909
01:28:27.811 --> 01:28:30.480
But Jocelyn, I am your own.

910
01:28:37.862 --> 01:28:39.570
Damn, girl.

911
01:28:40.406 --> 01:28:41.734
You need a surgeon.

912
01:28:42.033 --> 01:28:46.161
He's been. He says I will live,
though it doesn't feel that way.

913
01:28:47.746 --> 01:28:50.747
Oh, William. This pain is my doing.

914
01:28:51.083 --> 01:28:52.743
Yes, it is.

915
01:28:56.547 --> 01:28:57.875
Although...

916
01:28:58.715 --> 01:29:00.091
...my father...

917
01:29:02.552 --> 01:29:04.711
...taught me to take the bad...

918
01:29:05.764 --> 01:29:07.223
...with the good.

919
01:29:14.564 --> 01:29:16.557
This good you speak of.

920
01:29:19.402 --> 01:29:21.727
It will be my doing as well.

921
01:29:38.754 --> 01:29:43.131
How long since any of you have been
back? I've only been gone 6 months.

922
01:29:43.425 --> 01:29:45.252
Two years for me.

923
01:29:46.136 --> 01:29:47.417
Three years.

924
01:29:48.555 --> 01:29:52.090
Five. Five long years.

925
01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:56.098
William?

926
01:29:58.106 --> 01:29:59.269
Twelve.

927
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:02.651
Twelve years.

928
01:30:05.238 --> 01:30:06.816
He's to be an apprentice?

929
01:30:11.619 --> 01:30:12.734
How long for?

930
01:30:14.330 --> 01:30:15.611
Seven years.

931
01:30:49.656 --> 01:30:51.316
Sir Ector?

932
01:30:52.701 --> 01:30:56.152
I'm the thatcher. I spoke to you
outside London Stadium.

933
01:30:56.496 --> 01:30:58.323
Oh, yes. I remember.

934
01:30:58.832 --> 01:31:00.374
Is this the boy?

935
01:31:03.670 --> 01:31:06.208
Step forward, son. Let me look at you.

936
01:31:06.673 --> 01:31:08.665
Careful with that, Roland!

937
01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:16.338
Are you afraid of me, boy?

938
01:31:26.692 --> 01:31:28.981
Have you got most of your teeth?

939
01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.858
Show me your arm. ls it strong?

940
01:31:47.087 --> 01:31:50.253
Well, he's a half-starved little
scarecrow.

941
01:31:51.549 --> 01:31:53.376
But he has spirit.

942
01:31:57.221 --> 01:32:01.764
I can show you a great wide world
full of adventure...

943
01:32:02.602 --> 01:32:05.556
...and marvels you
do not yet dream of.

944
01:32:08.232 --> 01:32:11.103
Can you pack my horse and lead it?

945
01:32:17.908 --> 01:32:21.075
Well, come on.
Say goodbye to your father.

946
01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:27.242
He's a real knight, William.
Watch and learn all you can.

947
01:32:32.964 --> 01:32:35.290
It's all I can do for you, son.

948
01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:39.756
Now go change your stars
and live a better life than I have.

949
01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:53.649
Roland, show the boy his duties.

950
01:32:57.321 --> 01:33:00.986
-Father? I'm afraid.
-Of what?

951
01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:03.401
I won't know the way home.

952
01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:07.743
Don't be foolish, William.
You just follow your feet.

953
01:33:26.975 --> 01:33:28.090
London.

954
01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.805
Give us a shout out, London!

955
01:34:39.837 --> 01:34:43.502
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

956
01:35:20.877 --> 01:35:26.002
-Adhemar's here. He's entered.
-Must have grown bored with war.

957
01:35:26.215 --> 01:35:30.213
No, the Black Prince commanded it.
He had to disband his army.

958
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:33.506
They were reveling,
pillaging town after town.

959
01:35:33.723 --> 01:35:36.593
Robbing, murdering,
ransacking churches.

960
01:35:36.892 --> 01:35:41.056
Committing the oldest sins
in the newest ways.

961
01:35:43.065 --> 01:35:46.101
At last we will face each other again,
Sir Ulrich.

962
01:35:46.402 --> 01:35:48.193
And at the World Championship.

963
01:35:48.404 --> 01:35:50.396
And as I promised you before...

964
01:35:50.739 --> 01:35:53.444
...you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.

965
01:35:59.289 --> 01:36:00.914
Let the past die.

966
01:36:01.917 --> 01:36:05.665
You've done well in my absence,
on the field and off, I'm told.

967
01:36:06.421 --> 01:36:09.956
Winning trophies, horses, women.

968
01:36:11.176 --> 01:36:12.883
You put them in that order?

969
01:36:13.595 --> 01:36:16.299
Generally, with a few exceptions.

970
01:36:23.312 --> 01:36:24.937
Beautiful, isn't she?

971
01:36:25.606 --> 01:36:28.809
A real thoroughbred trophy,
don't you think?

972
01:36:29.944 --> 01:36:33.858
-You speak of her like a target.
-Isn't she?

973
01:36:34.657 --> 01:36:35.819
No.

974
01:36:39.912 --> 01:36:41.370
She is the arrow.

975
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.288
I've begun negotiations
with her father.

976
01:36:51.965 --> 01:36:53.792
I'm to make her my bride.

977
01:36:54.968 --> 01:36:57.459
She'll be saddled...

978
01:36:58.054 --> 01:37:00.296
...and placed on my mantle.

979
01:37:01.307 --> 01:37:03.383
Target or arrow, it doesn't matter.

980
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:06.018
I will have her.

981
01:37:11.442 --> 01:37:13.731
Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!

982
01:37:50.897 --> 01:37:54.764
-How would you beat him?
-With a stick, while he slept.

983
01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:58.064
But on a horse? With a lance?

984
01:37:58.863 --> 01:38:01.235
That man is unbeatable.

985
01:38:29.601 --> 01:38:30.764
Hello there.

986
01:38:33.897 --> 01:38:38.191
-You're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.
-Yes.

987
01:38:38.652 --> 01:38:43.029
You're my favorite knight.
When we joust, I always say I'm you.

988
01:38:44.199 --> 01:38:47.817
What are you doing in Cheapside?
There's no parade today.

989
01:38:52.415 --> 01:38:54.039
Can you keep a secret?

990
01:39:09.598 --> 01:39:13.762
I was born in Cheapside,
just around the corner there.

991
01:39:14.103 --> 01:39:17.020
-Truly, Sir Ulrich?
-Truly.

992
01:39:17.314 --> 01:39:19.639
I only live just there.

993
01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.735
How old are you?

994
01:39:22.986 --> 01:39:26.153
-Nine and one half.
-Nine and one half.

995
01:39:26.823 --> 01:39:30.903
I wonder if you remember a man,
though he may have died long ago.

996
01:39:31.119 --> 01:39:34.784
He was as tall as a knight.
His name was John Thatcher.

997
01:39:35.123 --> 01:39:37.744
-Of course I remember him.
-You do?

998
01:39:37.959 --> 01:39:40.117
Yes. He lives there still.

999
01:39:44.799 --> 01:39:48.797
Sometimes we see him sitting
at the window, but no one knows why.

1000
01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.719
What do you mean?

1001
01:39:54.308 --> 01:39:55.683
He's blind, sir.

1002
01:40:41.979 --> 01:40:43.557
Is someone there?

1003
01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.690
If you're here for the net,
I'm not done yet. Come tomorrow.

1004
01:40:56.994 --> 01:40:57.990
Who are you?

1005
01:41:01.039 --> 01:41:02.154
A knight.

1006
01:41:05.127 --> 01:41:08.246
My name...is Ulrich.

1007
01:41:09.506 --> 01:41:13.669
Ulrich? I hear that name
being chanted from the stadium.

1008
01:41:14.135 --> 01:41:16.009
What business have you here?

1009
01:41:16.513 --> 01:41:19.182
I have word, Master Thatcher.

1010
01:41:21.726 --> 01:41:22.757
Word of your son.

1011
01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:27.056
Of my William? Well, come in, sir.

1012
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:36.404
What word? Does he live?

1013
01:41:38.784 --> 01:41:40.492
Aye. He lives.

1014
01:41:42.538 --> 01:41:44.198
He is very well.

1015
01:41:45.874 --> 01:41:47.748
He wanted you to know...

1016
01:41:49.586 --> 01:41:51.958
...that he changed his stars
after all.

1017
01:42:01.890 --> 01:42:04.262
And has he followed his feet?

1018
01:42:07.896 --> 01:42:10.517
Has he found his way home at last?

1019
01:42:11.983 --> 01:42:12.979
Yes.

1020
01:42:21.117 --> 01:42:22.232
Father.

1021
01:42:22.577 --> 01:42:25.412
Oh, William. Oh, my boy.

1022
01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:39.709
I should like to meet this Wat.
And Roland too.

1023
01:42:39.927 --> 01:42:41.919
You will, Father.

1024
01:42:44.973 --> 01:42:48.757
And what of women?
Is there a certain one or many?

1025
01:42:50.604 --> 01:42:52.312
There is a certain one.

1026
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:56.106
I should like to meet her too.

1027
01:43:02.615 --> 01:43:04.941
This leak won't do, Father.

1028
01:43:05.535 --> 01:43:10.280
-Not in a thatcher's chamber.
-It's quite fitting for a blind one.

1029
01:43:12.625 --> 01:43:14.499
Well, a thatcher I am.

1030
01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:17.451
I'll fix it.

1031
01:44:01.964 --> 01:44:05.049
Alive. I thought he was dead,
which is mad...

1032
01:44:05.301 --> 01:44:08.551
...because he was also so strong.
Very strong.

1033
01:44:09.222 --> 01:44:11.179
-Geoff.
-Jocelyn.

1034
01:44:11.515 --> 01:44:13.971
This day just gets better and better.

1035
01:44:16.937 --> 01:44:18.100
Somebody die?

1036
01:44:21.358 --> 01:44:23.351
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

1037
01:44:27.072 --> 01:44:28.353
Adhemar...

1038
01:44:29.366 --> 01:44:32.865
...followed you last night.
To Cheapside.

1039
01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.948
He saw your father.

1040
01:44:36.206 --> 01:44:38.958
Will, they asked me for your patents.

1041
01:44:43.546 --> 01:44:46.832
They're waiting for you
in the lists to arrest you.

1042
01:44:47.717 --> 01:44:49.377
A dozen royal guards.

1043
01:44:50.553 --> 01:44:55.548
-They'll put you in the stocks.
-But I face Adhemar in five minutes.

1044
01:44:57.059 --> 01:45:00.891
No, you forfeit.
They've already marked it down.

1045
01:45:02.064 --> 01:45:05.398
Saddle the horses.
They can arrest your baggage, not you.

1046
01:45:11.574 --> 01:45:13.116
Halt.

1047
01:45:18.413 --> 01:45:20.121
So, what do you think...

1048
01:45:22.626 --> 01:45:24.535
...now that you know what I am?

1049
01:45:25.921 --> 01:45:30.084
To know what you are, William,
would take a lifetime.

1050
01:45:30.759 --> 01:45:33.594
One I am willing to give.
But now you must run.

1051
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:37.755
Run, and I will run with you.

1052
01:45:38.099 --> 01:45:40.092
Jocelyn, I cannot run.

1053
01:45:40.435 --> 01:45:43.934
I am a knight, and I will
put myself to the hazard!

1054
01:45:44.314 --> 01:45:48.097
ln your heart, not on paper.
And paper's what matters to them!

1055
01:45:51.279 --> 01:45:53.401
William, I love you.

1056
01:45:55.449 --> 01:45:57.821
I love you. You.

1057
01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:04.866
-I won't see you led to the stocks.
-But you'll see me run? No!

1058
01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:08.119
Damn your pride, William.

1059
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:11.464
It is only you that
will not see you run.

1060
01:46:11.715 --> 01:46:13.957
Pride's the one thing they can't take!

1061
01:46:14.217 --> 01:46:17.752
But they can take it from you.
They can and they will.

1062
01:46:18.513 --> 01:46:20.007
Oh, they will.

1063
01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:23.132
But love they cannot take.

1064
01:46:28.481 --> 01:46:30.806
And where will we live?

1065
01:46:31.985 --> 01:46:33.479
ln my hovel?

1066
01:46:35.196 --> 01:46:40.535
-With the pigs inside in winter?
-Yes, William, with the pigs.

1067
01:46:40.743 --> 01:46:42.072
With the pigs.

1068
01:46:45.164 --> 01:46:46.824
The poor can marry for love.

1069
01:46:48.667 --> 01:46:51.503
Jocelyn, you speak of what
you do not know!

1070
01:46:55.382 --> 01:46:57.375
William, I beg you.

1071
01:46:58.177 --> 01:46:59.505
Please.

1072
01:47:02.014 --> 01:47:03.757
Run. Do it for love.

1073
01:47:11.815 --> 01:47:13.523
Roland, you would see me run?

1074
01:47:20.532 --> 01:47:21.694
And you, Geoff?

1075
01:47:22.534 --> 01:47:25.404
I wish it too, with all
the pieces of my heart.

1076
01:47:31.709 --> 01:47:34.876
Wat? You and l? We aren't runners.

1077
01:47:39.550 --> 01:47:40.713
Yes.

1078
01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.463
William, today we are.

1079
01:47:47.891 --> 01:47:49.267
Run, William.

1080
01:47:56.066 --> 01:47:58.105
I will not run!

1081
01:48:05.408 --> 01:48:06.951
I am a knight.

1082
01:48:19.922 --> 01:48:21.251
Well, boys...

1083
01:48:21.841 --> 01:48:24.249
...all good things must come to an end.

1084
01:48:25.178 --> 01:48:27.087
Let's end them together.

1085
01:49:04.382 --> 01:49:08.000
You will remove yourself
from this position of honor.

1086
01:49:10.096 --> 01:49:11.424
I am here to compete.

1087
01:49:11.848 --> 01:49:14.220
You are here to be arrested.

1088
01:49:21.691 --> 01:49:23.019
All right!

1089
01:49:51.428 --> 01:49:54.049
He that strives to touch a star...

1090
01:49:54.931 --> 01:49:56.591
...oft stumbles...

1091
01:49:56.933 --> 01:49:58.593
...at a simple straw.

1092
01:50:09.570 --> 01:50:11.278
You have been weighed.

1093
01:50:18.913 --> 01:50:20.620
You have been measured.

1094
01:50:23.625 --> 01:50:25.333
And you have been found wanting.

1095
01:50:30.966 --> 01:50:33.920
It's one loss or another...William.

1096
01:50:40.016 --> 01:50:43.765
ln what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1097
01:51:22.057 --> 01:51:23.516
Leave, Roland.

1098
01:51:24.601 --> 01:51:25.930
Let them have me.

1099
01:51:26.937 --> 01:51:28.764
God love you, William.

1100
01:51:29.147 --> 01:51:30.558
So do I.

1101
01:51:31.149 --> 01:51:33.307
Go! Disperse!

1102
01:51:35.612 --> 01:51:37.236
Or I will fong you!

1103
01:51:37.822 --> 01:51:40.776
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene
and his holy mother...

1104
01:51:41.034 --> 01:51:44.568
...the Virgin Mary are my witnesses,
I will fong you!

1105
01:51:45.496 --> 01:51:48.201
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

1106
01:51:48.583 --> 01:51:52.746
I'll stick my fist and break you!
Pain! Lots of pain!

1107
01:51:59.009 --> 01:52:00.420
We're in trouble.

1108
01:52:04.181 --> 01:52:05.841
Listen to me.

1109
01:52:10.521 --> 01:52:12.513
Listen to me!

1110
01:52:45.221 --> 01:52:47.593
What a pair we make, huh?

1111
01:52:51.102 --> 01:52:53.224
Both trying to hide who we are.

1112
01:52:54.563 --> 01:52:55.892
Both unable to do so.

1113
01:53:04.907 --> 01:53:06.733
Your men love you.

1114
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:12.077
If I knew nothing else about you,
that would be enough.

1115
01:53:13.623 --> 01:53:17.407
But you also tilt
when you should withdraw.

1116
01:53:19.921 --> 01:53:21.830
That is knightly too.

1117
01:53:30.098 --> 01:53:31.296
Release him.

1118
01:53:41.275 --> 01:53:44.276
He may appear to be
of humble origins...

1119
01:53:45.529 --> 01:53:48.613
...but my personal historians
have discovered...

1120
01:53:48.949 --> 01:53:52.567
...that he descends
from an ancient royal line.

1121
01:53:55.956 --> 01:53:57.664
This is my word.

1122
01:53:59.126 --> 01:54:02.625
And as such, is beyond contestation.

1123
01:54:07.968 --> 01:54:08.916
Now...

1124
01:54:10.303 --> 01:54:13.637
...if I may repay the kindness
you once showed me.

1125
01:54:14.974 --> 01:54:15.970
Take a knee.

1126
01:54:33.033 --> 01:54:37.031
By the power vested in me
by my father, King Edward...

1127
01:54:38.205 --> 01:54:40.661
...and by all the witnesses here...

1128
01:54:43.836 --> 01:54:45.164
...I dub thee...

1129
01:54:47.881 --> 01:54:49.162
...Sir William.

1130
01:55:01.436 --> 01:55:04.009
Arise...Sir William.

1131
01:55:11.404 --> 01:55:12.684
Can you joust?

1132
01:55:14.365 --> 01:55:16.358
There's my tournament to finish.

1133
01:55:16.868 --> 01:55:21.364
Now, are you fit to compete,
or shall the forfeit stand?

1134
01:55:22.206 --> 01:55:23.155
I'm fit.

1135
01:55:24.542 --> 01:55:29.453
I shall have your opponent informed.
Look for his shield on the lists.

1136
01:55:30.047 --> 01:55:31.375
At once.

1137
01:55:32.049 --> 01:55:33.460
Thank you, my lord.

1138
01:55:43.935 --> 01:55:46.391
All hail Prince Edward!

1139
01:55:51.401 --> 01:55:53.726
My lords, my ladies...

1140
01:55:54.612 --> 01:55:57.068
...and all you other people.

1141
01:55:57.907 --> 01:56:02.616
I give you the son of Philippe
de Vitry, son of Gilles....

1142
01:56:05.248 --> 01:56:07.240
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

1143
01:56:07.959 --> 01:56:10.960
It's nothing but spun sugar
and boot black.

1144
01:56:19.929 --> 01:56:21.506
It's a small target...

1145
01:56:23.265 --> 01:56:24.925
...but aim for his heart.

1146
01:56:31.106 --> 01:56:33.348
--doer of daring deeds...

1147
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:37.978
...conqueror of countless kingdoms,
Count...

1148
01:56:41.783 --> 01:56:43.443
...Adhemar!

1149
01:58:28.595 --> 01:58:30.587
Oh, God. I'll get the surgeon.

1150
01:58:30.889 --> 01:58:31.920
Roland!

1151
01:58:32.474 --> 01:58:33.672
You're the surgeon.

1152
01:58:36.102 --> 01:58:37.217
Come on.

1153
01:58:44.986 --> 01:58:46.065
He tipped it.

1154
01:58:48.906 --> 01:58:51.064
Kate, get me back to one.

1155
01:58:51.450 --> 01:58:53.407
Otherwise we forfeit.

1156
01:59:00.584 --> 01:59:02.742
Dirty son of a bitch!

1157
02:00:12.987 --> 02:00:16.321
Kate, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1158
02:00:22.997 --> 02:00:25.155
As I said, thatcher.

1159
02:00:27.376 --> 02:00:30.330
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1160
02:00:31.005 --> 02:00:32.962
Such a place does not exist.

1161
02:00:35.384 --> 02:00:37.092
She's here William.

1162
02:00:39.263 --> 02:00:40.342
With your father.

1163
02:00:44.852 --> 02:00:46.429
Change your stars.

1164
02:00:51.483 --> 02:00:53.274
Let's dance, you and I.

1165
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:58.738
It's two lances to none.

1166
02:00:59.032 --> 02:01:02.697
You must unhorse him or kill him.
It's the only way to win.

1167
02:01:12.712 --> 02:01:15.582
-You need more padding.
-No, leave it off.

1168
02:01:16.215 --> 02:01:17.875
I can't breathe with it on.

1169
02:01:23.556 --> 02:01:24.670
Lance.

1170
02:01:30.104 --> 02:01:31.646
I can barely grip it.

1171
02:01:31.897 --> 02:01:33.226
Damn.

1172
02:01:39.905 --> 02:01:41.233
Lash it to my arm.

1173
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:46.608
Wat...

1174
02:01:47.329 --> 02:01:48.871
...lash it to me arm.

1175
02:01:52.042 --> 02:01:53.073
Do it.

1176
02:02:11.352 --> 02:02:12.894
Good people!

1177
02:02:13.938 --> 02:02:15.266
I missed my introduction!

1178
02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:28.110
But please...

1179
02:02:28.452 --> 02:02:30.112
...please, I pray you.

1180
02:02:30.621 --> 02:02:32.115
Hear it now.

1181
02:02:33.498 --> 02:02:35.456
For I would lay rest...

1182
02:02:35.792 --> 02:02:38.117
...the grace in my tongue...

1183
02:02:38.462 --> 02:02:40.122
...and speak plain.

1184
02:02:41.298 --> 02:02:43.124
Days like these...

1185
02:02:43.466 --> 02:02:47.131
...are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy-handed words.

1186
02:02:48.471 --> 02:02:52.339
And so, I'm afraid,
without any ado whatsoever--

1187
02:02:52.976 --> 02:02:54.351
Excuse me, my lord.

1188
02:02:54.811 --> 02:02:58.144
Here he is! One of your own!

1189
02:02:59.148 --> 02:03:02.066
Born a stone's throw from
this very stadium...

1190
02:03:02.401 --> 02:03:04.228
...and here before you now.

1191
02:03:04.570 --> 02:03:06.563
The son of John Thatcher...

1192
02:03:07.573 --> 02:03:10.574
...Sir William Thatcher!

1193
02:03:21.712 --> 02:03:22.743
That's your name.

1194
02:03:25.716 --> 02:03:27.708
Sir William Thatcher.

1195
02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:29.921
Your father heard that.

1196
02:03:48.029 --> 02:03:49.737
Godspeed, William.

1197
02:05:01.725 --> 02:05:04.430
William!

1198
02:05:25.457 --> 02:05:27.449
You have been weighed.

1199
02:05:28.918 --> 02:05:30.116
You've been measured.

1200
02:05:33.297 --> 02:05:35.456
And you absolutely...

1201
02:05:36.133 --> 02:05:37.793
...have been found wanting.

1202
02:05:41.972 --> 02:05:43.799
Welcome to the new world.

1203
02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:47.849
God save you, if it is right
that he should do so.

1204
02:05:54.443 --> 02:05:56.566
William!

1205
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:12.369
Yes!

1206
02:06:13.795 --> 02:06:15.373
He's won! He's won!

1207
02:06:50.455 --> 02:06:52.115
You beat him, Will!

1208
02:06:56.795 --> 02:06:58.206
Oh, William.

1209
02:07:18.816 --> 02:07:20.809
I'm going to write this story.

1210
02:07:21.110 --> 02:07:23.103
About the prince and the knights?

1211
02:07:23.362 --> 02:07:28.320
No, all of it. All human activity
lies within the artist's scope.

1212
02:07:30.828 --> 02:07:32.655
Maybe not yours.

1213
02:12:05.552 --> 02:12:06.715
Your round.
