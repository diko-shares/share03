2
00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.918
<i>Shall we help him?</i>

3
00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.122
<i>Well, he has to be in the
lists in two minutes,</i>

4
00:01:02.393 --> 00:01:04.022
two minutes or forfeit.

5
00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:05.532
Lend us those.

6
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.935
Right. Left.

7
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.035
Thank you.

8
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:21.274
Dead.

9
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:22.874
Eh?

10
00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.578
Three scores to none after two lances.

11
00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:30.290
All Sir Ector needs t'do is not
fall off 'is horse an' we've won!

12
00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.552
He's dead.

13
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.182
What d'you mean "dead"?

14
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.082
The spark of his life is
smothered in shite.

15
00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:43.136
His spirit is gone but
his stench remains.

16
00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:45.390
Does that answer your question?

17
00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:46.890
No, no, no, no, no...

18
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.476
No, he sleeps, rouse him.

19
00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:53.129
We're minutes from victory,
I haven't eaten in three days!

20
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.372
None of us have Wat!

21
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.176
We need to fetch a priest.

22
00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:57.776
No, he's not dead!

23
00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.371
You wake up!

24
00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.771
Come on, hah?!

25
00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:03.156
Come on!

26
00:02:03.488 --> 00:02:04.256
Uhh!

27
00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:04.906
Ahh!!!

28
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.544
You manky git!

29
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.996
Roland...

30
00:02:12.123 --> 00:02:13.569
Oi, Squire!

31
00:02:13.823 --> 00:02:15.269
Sir Ector must report at once,

32
00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:16.769
or forfeit the match.

33
00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.005
- Oh he's uh...
- He's on his way!

34
00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:25.879
Hah!

35
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:29.910
I'll ride in his place.

36
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.163
Strip his armor,

37
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.063
I'm riding in his place.

38
00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:37.101
Wat, stop kicking him, calm down!

39
00:02:37.197 --> 00:02:38.201
I'm riding in his place.

40
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.821
Help me, please.

41
00:02:40.477 --> 00:02:42.171
What's your name, William?

42
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.992
I'm asking you, William Thatcher,
to answer me with your name.

43
00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:49.995
It's not "Sir" William.

44
00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:53.214
It's not "Count" or "Duke" or "Earl" William.
It's certainly not "King" William?

45
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:54.782
I'm aware of that.

46
00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.891
You have to be of noble birth to compete!

47
00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.090
A detail!

48
00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:00.990
The landscape is food.

49
00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:02.990
Do you want to eat or don't you?

50
00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:06.525
If the nobles find out who you are,
there'll be the devil to pay!

51
00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:09.556
Then pray that they don't.

In favor of Sir Ector!

96
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.994
Lord Philip of Aragon,

97
00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:36.861
Stand ye ready?!

98
00:05:37.235 --> 00:05:38.861
<i>Aragon! Aragon! Aragon...</i>

99
00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.296
Sir Ector,

100
00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.010
Stand ye ready?!

101
00:05:43.084 --> 00:05:44.085
Ready?

102
00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.604
Of course, I have tilted against
Sir Ector many times you know.

103
00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.989
In practice as his target.

104
00:05:48.093 --> 00:05:49.749
You're never allowed to strike him.

105
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:51.245
Badger me not with details.

106
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:53.345
Landscape, then.
Stay on the horse.

107
00:05:53.678 --> 00:05:56.399
He needs 3 points to beat you so a
broken lance won't win it for him,

108
00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:57.665
he has to knock you off the horse!

109
00:05:57.799 --> 00:05:59.768
I know how to score, Roland.

110
00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:03.396
I've waited my whole
life for this moment.

111
00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:07.775
You've waited your whole life for
Sir Ector to shite himself to death?

112
00:06:10.691 --> 00:06:15.175
<i>...Ector! Ector! Ector...</i>

113
00:06:21.024 --> 00:06:22.307
Hyaah!!

114
00:06:25.024 --> 00:06:27.007
Hooaahh!!!

115
00:06:27.224 --> 00:06:29.107
Hooaahh!!!

116
00:06:30.024 --> 00:06:31.907
Hooaaahh!!!

117
00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.907
Get it in the cradle, get it in...

118
00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.892
- ...the cradle.
- Get it in the cradle!!

119
00:06:54.992 --> 00:06:56.556
Ahh!

120
00:06:57.952 --> 00:06:59.486
Uhh!!

121
00:07:04.502 --> 00:07:05.656
Oohh!

122
00:07:06.822 --> 00:07:07.556
Yeah!

123
00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:11.756
- Yeah, damn you!
- William, are you all right?

124
00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.517
- Are you alive?! William, can you hear me?
- We won! We won!

125
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:16.697
- William? Get off me! William!
- We won! We won!

126
00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:18.597
can you hear me, William?

127
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:19.597
Is he breathing?

128
00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:20.932
We won!!

129
00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:22.123
He's breathing! He's breathing!!

130
00:07:22.224 --> 00:07:23.243
He's breathing!!

131
00:07:23.314 --> 00:07:24.743
Ah, ha ha ha ha!!

132
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.813
Sir Ector...

133
00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.091
Sir Ector,

134
00:07:34.352 --> 00:07:35.621
remove your helmet!

135
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:39.596
<i>Uh...my lord...

136
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:43.196
I'm afraid the final blow of the
lance has bent it onto my head.

137
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.732
H-he says...er...
the final blow of th-uhh!

138
00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:49.669
I present your champion, my lord.

139
00:08:15.987 --> 00:08:17.197
Twenty.

140
00:08:17.489 --> 00:08:18.757
No, Ten.

141
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.998
Fifteen.

142
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.568
Done.

143
00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:27.707
Very good. Cheers.

144
00:08:32.504 --> 00:08:35.257
Fifteen silver florins.
He didn't want that.

145
00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.259
That's five for William.

146
00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:39.421
Five... for Wat.

147
00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:41.921
Five for Roland, who's going
straight home to England.

148
00:08:42.097 --> 00:08:45.475
Straight to the pub
for me. Eel pie, brie tart...

149
00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:48.603
tansy cakes with peppermint
cream oh-hohohoho...

150
00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.568
We could do this.

151
00:08:54.776 --> 00:08:57.404
Do it? we've done it, boy.
That's silver in your hand.

152
00:08:58.238 --> 00:09:00.083
No, I mean, we can do this.

153
00:09:00.438 --> 00:09:02.083
We can be champions.

154
00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.089
Give us your coins.

155
00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:12.911
Now, come on, give me your coins.

156
00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:15.795
Right.

157
00:09:16.464 --> 00:09:18.425
Right, now that's one for you.

158
00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:19.836
And one...

159
00:09:20.808 --> 00:09:21.736
for you.

160
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.856
Which leaves...

161
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.856
thirteen.

162
00:09:24.973 --> 00:09:27.601
That's thirteen for training
and outfitting.

163
00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:30.770
Now the tournament in Rouen
is in a month from now.

164
00:09:31.146 --> 00:09:34.115
In one month we could split a
prize bigger than this one.

165
00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:37.606
In one month we could be on
our way to glory and riches

166
00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:38.986
none of us ever dreamed of.

167
00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:41.602
In one month we could be laid
in a ditch with Sir Ector,

168
00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:44.142
I don't want glory and riches William,
I just want to go home.

169
00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:45.797
Tansy cakes with peppermint cream,

170
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:49.497
Dilled veal balls with squash fritters,
I'll take my five now!

171
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:55.497
Boy!

172
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.297
Oi, wait up!

173
00:09:57.856 --> 00:09:59.925
You're going the wrong way!

174
00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.677
But you can't even joust.

175
00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:06.681
Most of it is the guts to take a blow,
to strike one, guts I have.

176
00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:08.410
And technique?

177
00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:10.510
I have a month to learn that.

178
00:10:10.685 --> 00:10:12.147
Besides the sword,

179
00:10:12.285 --> 00:10:13.805
name a man better with
a sword than I?

180
00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:14.842
In the practice ring!

181
00:10:14.945 --> 00:10:17.542
You're not of noble birth.

182
00:10:17.651 --> 00:10:19.194
Oh so, we lie.

183
00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:23.089
How did the nobles become
noble in the first place huh?

184
00:10:24.466 --> 00:10:25.494
They took it,

185
00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:26.994
at the tip of a sword.

186
00:10:27.196 --> 00:10:28.299
I'll do it with a lance.

187
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.614
- A blunted lance?
- Oh, no matter, Wat!

188
00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.744
A man can change his stars!

189
00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:36.744
And I won't spend the rest
of my life as nothing.

190
00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:41.149
That is nothing. And nothing is
right where glory'll take us!

191
00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:43.409
We're the sons of peasants.

192
00:10:43.603 --> 00:10:45.779
Glory and riches and stars
are beyond our grasp.

193
00:10:45.971 --> 00:10:49.182
But a full stomach?
That dream can come true!

194
00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:01.903
<i>If</i> you can take your coins,
go to England, eat cake.

195
00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:03.307
But if you can't,

196
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.607
you, come with me.

197
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.929
You see money doesn't matter!

198
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.274
Huh?!!

199
00:11:17.854 --> 00:11:18.806
N-no!...

00:11:24.954 --> 00:11:26.606
Aahhh! Oww!

202
00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:27.606
Ohhh!

203
00:11:27.954 --> 00:11:29.606
You see how hungry I am?!

204
00:11:29.854 --> 00:11:30.626
Do you?!

205
00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:32.325
Damn your stomach, Wat!

206
00:11:34.352 --> 00:11:36.729
Roland, please.

207
00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:43.477
With 13 silver pieces,
three men can change their stars.

208
00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:53.179
God love you, William.

209
00:11:53.271 --> 00:11:55.607

No one else will.

we should do it again.

We haven't reached
the mile marker yet.

251
00:14:36.574 --> 00:14:37.744
And I'm not sure you should.

252
00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:39.440
Suppose we passed another knight,

253
00:14:39.569 --> 00:14:41.740
how would it look if my squire
rode while I walked?

<i>Hey, hey, hey,
maybe nobody should be ridin'.</i>

257
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.416
The horse is not what he used
to be, and we need him right?

Fine, Fine, Fine!

Oi, sir!

262
00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:08.816
Wha' are you doing?

263
00:15:08.984 --> 00:15:10.069
Uh...

264
00:15:10.584 --> 00:15:11.869
Trudging.

265
00:15:14.447 --> 00:15:16.616
You know, trudging? To trudge?

266
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.327
To trudge the slow, weary...

267
00:15:19.661 --> 00:15:23.456
depressing, yet determined walk of a
man who has nothing left in his life

268
00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:25.594
except the impulse to simply,

269
00:15:25.948 --> 00:15:27.094
soldier on!

270
00:15:27.254 --> 00:15:28.821
Um... were you robbed?

271
00:15:29.163 --> 00:15:32.632
Er... interesting question actually... Yes.

272
00:15:32.883 --> 00:15:35.935
And at the same time,
a huge, resounding "No."

273
00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:38.981
It's more a sort of involuntary
vow of poverty...

274
00:15:39.211 --> 00:15:40.181
...really.

275
00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:42.177
But you know on the brighter side,

276
00:15:42.273 --> 00:15:43.977
trudging does represent pride.

277
00:15:44.352 --> 00:15:46.981
Pride, resolve and faith

278
00:15:47.152 --> 00:15:48.181
in the good Lord Almighty.

279
00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:50.726
Please, Christ, rescue me
from my current tribul-

280
00:15:50.915 --> 00:15:52.026
Aahhgh!!

281
00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.254
...lations.

282
00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:57.040
Who are ya?

283
00:15:59.926 --> 00:16:01.361
<i>Lilium inter spinas.</i>

284
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.206
"The lily among the thorns."

285
00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:06.167
Geoffrey Chaucer's the name.

286
00:16:06.497 --> 00:16:07.967
Writing's the game.

287
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.425
Chaucer?

288
00:16:16.835 --> 00:16:19.428
Geoffrey Chaucer, the writer?

289
00:16:22.532 --> 00:16:23.331
A what?

290
00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:25.301
A wha- "a what?" A writer.

291
00:16:25.435 --> 00:16:28.440
You know I write with,
ink and parchment.

292
00:16:28.535 --> 00:16:31.300
For a penny, I'll scribble you
anything you want. From...

293
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.811
summonses, decrees, edicts,
warrants, patents of nobility.

294
00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:39.215
I've even been known to jot down a
poem or two if the muse descends.

295
00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.769
You probably read my book?

296
00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.569
<i>The Book of the Duchess?</i>

297
00:16:45.455 --> 00:16:47.298
Fine! Well, it was allegorical.

298
00:16:47.374 --> 00:16:51.411
Well, we won't hold that against you.
That's for each man to decide for himself.

299
00:16:52.662 --> 00:16:55.048
Did you say patents of nobility?

300
00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:58.918
Yes, that's right, I did.

301
00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:03.907

302
00:17:04.155 --> 00:17:05.107

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.152
No, wait a minute, I'm Charlemagne!

311
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.337
No, I'm St. John the Baptist-sshit!

312
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.537
All right!

313
00:17:25.729 --> 00:17:26.298
Oohf!

314
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.098
Hold your tongue, sir, or lose it!

315
00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:33.336
Now you see <i>that</i> I do believe...

316
00:17:33.937 --> 00:17:35.871
Sir Ulrich.

317
00:17:36.673 --> 00:17:38.467
Thank you...

318
00:17:38.873 --> 00:17:40.167
Geoff.

319
00:17:41.428 --> 00:17:45.932
Have you any more to say Master Nude, or
having failed your test may we be on our way?

320
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.503
Oh, you're off to the
tournament, are ye?

321
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.353
This is the road to Rouen isn't it?

322
00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:53.283
Well, you know, that really
remains to be seen.

323
00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:55.483
Y'see. they're limiting
the field at Rouen.

324
00:17:55.825 --> 00:18:00.830
Noble birth must be established for four
generations on either side of the family,

325
00:18:01.156 --> 00:18:04.559
patents of nobility
must be provided.

326
00:18:13.585 --> 00:18:15.978
Listen, clothe me,

327
00:18:16.379 --> 00:18:19.383
shoe me, for God's sake feed me,
let me ride that horse a bit

328
00:18:19.579 --> 00:18:21.383
and you'll have your patents.

329
00:18:21.985 --> 00:18:23.294
No.

330
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.890
Patents of nobility.

331
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.090
We need him.

332
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.590
We need him.

333
00:18:28.183 --> 00:18:29.644
A'right let me handle it.

334
00:18:29.783 --> 00:18:30.994
Be nice.

335
00:18:35.232 --> 00:18:37.234
Nice, nice, nice...

336
00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:39.611
All right.

337
00:18:39.835 --> 00:18:40.911
Uh...

338
00:18:41.238 --> 00:18:43.025
betray us,

339
00:18:43.338 --> 00:18:46.225
and I will fong you, until
your insides are out,

340
00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:50.580
your outsides are in, your entrails
will become your extrails.

341
00:18:51.309 --> 00:18:53.580
I will wreak...

342
00:18:54.219 --> 00:18:55.080
all the p...

343
00:18:55.529 --> 00:18:56.380
uh...

344
00:18:56.645 --> 00:18:57.837
P-pain!

345
00:18:59.394 --> 00:19:00.924
Lots of pain!

346
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.780
May I present my Lord Ulrich,

347
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.980
whose mother's father was
Shilhard von Rechberg

348
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.026
son of the Duke Guelph of Saxony,

349
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.026
son of Ghibellines, son of Wendish
the 4th earl of brunswich

350
00:19:20.318 --> 00:19:22.163
the same Wendish who inherited
the fief of luhmberg...

351
00:19:22.318 --> 00:19:23.763
That'll do, herald.

352
00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:28.492
Six generations is more than enough.
Show me the patents.

353
00:19:36.918 --> 00:19:41.256
Indicate in which events shall
your Lord Ulrich compete.

354
00:19:44.801 --> 00:19:48.371
<i> King of Arms) He'll first
meet Roger Lord Mortimer.</i>

355
00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:50.307
Thank you very much.

356
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.186
I can't believe it!

357
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.486
You did it, Chaucer!

358
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.215
I have to thank you. I didn't
think we had a chance.

359
00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.915
Mmm...

360
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.370
My pleasure, William.

361
00:20:12.762 --> 00:20:15.198
Now if you don't mind, I think I'll stick
around and see how things turn out

362
00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:17.876
act as my herald, and you'll
receive a share of the winnings.

363
00:20:18.126 --> 00:20:19.180
Done.

364
00:20:19.526 --> 00:20:22.380
Now if you don't mind, I have to
go see a man about a dog.

00:21:58.685 --> 00:22:00.145
Would you speak to me?

373
00:22:01.313 --> 00:22:03.356
Ah, to speak.

374
00:22:05.192 --> 00:22:08.320
But sir, my sex are marked
by their silence.

375
00:22:08.653 --> 00:22:11.464
Oh, I would hear you speak
if it cost me my ears.

376
00:22:11.656 --> 00:22:14.901
That is well, for I do not
want silence in my life.

377
00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:16.770
Tell me your name.

378
00:22:20.223 --> 00:22:21.626
Would you care if I were ugly?

379
00:22:21.723 --> 00:22:23.126
Uh, Yes!

380
00:22:23.877 --> 00:22:26.146
I mean, no. I mean... if...

381
00:22:26.338 --> 00:22:30.916
You desecrate the house of God!!!

382
00:22:33.338 --> 00:22:34.516
Oh,

383
00:22:36.638 --> 00:22:37.916
Ohh!!

Uh...

385
00:22:44.773 --> 00:22:46.141
Tell me your name, woman.

386
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.237
And what would you do with
my name, Sir Hunter?

387
00:22:50.962 --> 00:22:53.832
Call me a fox, for that
is all I am to you.

388
00:22:54.062 --> 00:22:54.932
A fox?

389
00:22:55.075 --> 00:22:58.038
Oh well then a fox you shall
be until I find your name,

390
00:22:58.475 --> 00:23:00.438
my foxy lady!

391
00:23:01.575 --> 00:23:02.438
Ahh!

392
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:07.212
He's a handsome hunter.
I give him that.

393
00:23:07.546 --> 00:23:10.515
Does this not shock you, ladies?!

394
00:23:12.467 --> 00:23:14.060
Certainly, my lord.

395
00:23:14.761 --> 00:23:19.290
I-I just, I only laugh just
to keep from weeping.

396
00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:23.127
Beauty is such a curse.

397
00:23:24.512 --> 00:23:26.089
Pray your years come swiftly.

398
00:23:26.223 --> 00:23:29.484
Pray your beauty fades that
you may better serve God.

399
00:23:30.527 --> 00:23:33.822
Oh, I do, my lord. I pray
for it all the time.

400
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.577
Why? God, did you curse
me with this face?

401
00:23:39.786 --> 00:23:43.748
God's will has a purpose,
but we may not know it.

402
00:23:47.502 --> 00:23:49.671
Oh, that is lovely!

Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein,

410
00:24:23.989 --> 00:24:30.077
defeats Roger Lord Mortimer
one lance to none!

411
00:24:31.896 --> 00:24:34.899
Easy boys! They're likely to think it's
the first time I've broken a lance!

412
00:24:34.991 --> 00:24:36.792
Hah! but it is william, it is!

413
00:24:36.881 --> 00:24:38.912
But Sir Ulrich's broken
thousands of lances!

414
00:24:39.091 --> 00:24:42.999
Well, come on, master of a thousand lances
you're due in the sword ring in 2 minutes.

415
00:24:43.293 --> 00:24:45.043
-  Come on!
- My armor's loose!

416
00:24:53.276 --> 00:24:55.529
Oh Shite! If they come
overhead, I can't block!

417
00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:59.207
Well, there's nothing for it now. We're
overdue in the sword ring as we speak.

418
00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:00.107
Ohh!

419
00:25:00.534 --> 00:25:03.954
It was a mistake to do 2 events.
I don't have time to breathe.

420
00:25:04.387 --> 00:25:05.491
I should withdraw
from the sword.

421
00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:08.291
B-But the sword is by far
what you're best at.

422
00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:09.993
But the prizes are
bigger in the joust,

423
00:25:10.124 --> 00:25:11.503
the prestige as well.

424
00:25:11.795 --> 00:25:12.865
Ulrich von Lichtenstein?

425
00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:13.865
Yes.

426
00:25:13.995 --> 00:25:15.765
I am Simon the Summoner.

427
00:25:16.007 --> 00:25:18.060
And I'm overdue at the sword arena

428
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:22.772
I must detain you,
on behalf of your herald.

<i>You were never robbed,
were you?</i>

430
00:25:28.186 --> 00:25:30.697
Look, I have a gambling problem.

431
00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:33.316
I can't help myself.

432
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.528
And these people they'll... heh!...

433
00:25:37.237 --> 00:25:40.115
quite literally take the
clothes off your back.

434
00:25:41.491 --> 00:25:43.493
What do you expect
us to do about it?

435
00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:48.906
He assured us that you,
his liege, would pay us.

436
00:25:52.502 --> 00:25:53.837
And who are you?

437
00:25:54.337 --> 00:25:57.473
Peter, a humble pardoner...

438
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:59.826
and purveyor of religious relics.

439
00:25:59.949 --> 00:26:01.526
Mmm...

440
00:26:01.636 --> 00:26:02.804
How much does he owe you?

441
00:26:03.346 --> 00:26:05.932
Ten gold florins.

442
00:26:07.183 --> 00:26:09.135
You manky git!

443
00:26:10.687 --> 00:26:12.318
- Pain! Pain!
- Get him off me!

444
00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:13.599
- Hey, hey, hey!!
- Take the pain!!

445
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.483
- Wat, let him go!
- Get him off...

446
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.483
Oww!!

447
00:26:25.577 --> 00:26:27.647
What would you do to him

448
00:26:27.777 --> 00:26:29.747
if I was to refuse?

449
00:26:30.749 --> 00:26:31.689
We,

450
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:33.919
on behalf of the Lord God,

451
00:26:34.252 --> 00:26:36.682
will take it from his flesh,

452
00:26:36.892 --> 00:26:38.822
so that he may understand

453
00:26:38.932 --> 00:26:40.693
that gambling,

454
00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:42.093
is a sin.

455
00:26:45.222 --> 00:26:46.598
Oh, come on...

456
00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:48.934
please, Will...

457
00:26:52.395 --> 00:26:55.232
Please, will you help me,
Sir Ulrich?

458
00:26:56.942 --> 00:26:59.069
I promise you won't regret it.

459
00:27:01.571 --> 00:27:03.490
I don't have the money.

460
00:27:08.912 --> 00:27:10.455
Release him...

461
00:27:11.248 --> 00:27:13.917
and for God's sake give
him back his clothes...

462
00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.262
and you'll get it.

463
00:27:18.204 --> 00:27:19.064
Done!

464
00:27:23.977 --> 00:27:24.794
You lied!

465
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:29.641
Yes, yes I lied I'm a...I'm a writer.
I give the truth scope!

Ten blows by sword.

473
00:27:38.777 --> 00:27:40.094
Sir Ulrich to receive first.

474
00:27:38.877 --> 00:27:39.894
Sword.

<i>Stop letting him hit you!</i>

00:28:00.505 --> 00:28:02.507
<i>Oh shut up! Shut up!</i>

485
00:28:03.967 --> 00:28:07.137
Two strikes for Sir Walter Loring!

486
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.639
Sir Ulrich to strike!

487
00:28:10.432 --> 00:28:12.333
- Now it's your turn, mate!
- Come on, Ulrich!

488
00:28:12.432 --> 00:28:13.483

Strike!

492
00:28:29.367 --> 00:28:31.536
I taught him that!
That's me! That's me!

493
00:28:31.828 --> 00:28:35.040
Sir Ulrich prevails,
five strikes to two!

00:31:29.773 --> 00:31:31.049
Thank you.

539
00:31:32.384 --> 00:31:33.803
Excuse me.

540
00:31:33.904 --> 00:31:35.303
I don't work for free.

541
00:31:35.512 --> 00:31:37.424
And I can't joust with broken armor.

542
00:31:37.512 --> 00:31:39.724
Your problem, not mine.

543
00:31:40.684 --> 00:31:43.645
Each drop of this sweat
has a price on it.

544
00:31:46.523 --> 00:31:49.901
Oh, just as well. They told me
I was daft to even ask you.

545
00:31:50.986 --> 00:31:51.830
Who?

546
00:31:52.586 --> 00:31:54.330
Oh, the other armorers.

547
00:31:57.325 --> 00:32:00.020
Did they say I couldn't do it
because I'm a woman?

548
00:32:00.871 --> 00:32:03.965
N-no... they said you're great with
horseshoes, but shite with armor.

549
00:32:04.115 --> 00:32:06.393
The fact you're a woman
wasn't even mentioned.

550
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.048
Cat's meat! Hot wine!

551
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:14.551
Cat's meat! Hot wine?!

552
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:16.951
Cat's meat! Hot wine...!

553
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:33.745
Lady, I will win this
tournament for you.

554
00:32:33.954 --> 00:32:36.156
Nay! I will win for you.

555
00:32:36.406 --> 00:32:37.258
My Lady...

556
00:32:37.406 --> 00:32:38.758
May I present Count Adhemar...

557
00:32:38.966 --> 00:32:42.245
winner of the joust in France
and high champion at Saint-Emilion.

558
00:32:44.915 --> 00:32:46.920
All such moments forgotten,

559
00:32:47.035 --> 00:32:50.490
when standing before the most
beautiful woman in Christendom.

560
00:32:55.258 --> 00:32:58.263
Do you only pretend
to fight Count Adhemar,

561
00:32:58.358 --> 00:33:00.463
or do you wage
real war as well?

562
00:33:01.264 --> 00:33:03.362
I am leader of the
free companies.

563
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:05.562
My army is in southern France,

564
00:33:05.664 --> 00:33:06.562
for the moment.

565
00:33:08.438 --> 00:33:11.149
Geoff, 'tis my lady.

566
00:33:11.775 --> 00:33:13.746
Oh geez, William, you aim too high.

567
00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:16.046
Oh, if there's another way
to aim I don't know it!

568
00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:17.491
Concentrate!

569
00:33:17.879 --> 00:33:19.191
What should I say to her?

570
00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:29.834
What do you think of the joust?

571
00:33:30.502 --> 00:33:32.337
- It's very abrupt.
- Hmm...

572
00:33:33.046 --> 00:33:35.507
I'm afraid I don't understand the rules.

573
00:33:36.383 --> 00:33:38.176
Then I shall educate you.

574
00:33:39.177 --> 00:33:42.013
A match is three lances.

575
00:33:43.181 --> 00:33:44.778
One point

576
00:33:44.881 --> 00:33:47.978
is awarded for breaking a lance on
a man between the waist and neck.

577
00:33:48.186 --> 00:33:50.356
Two points for breaking
on the helmet.

578
00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:51.356
It's difficult.

579
00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.894
The helmet sweeps back.
Most blows glance off.

580
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.694
Leaving the lance unbroken

581
00:33:56.069 --> 00:33:59.614
and three points for bearing
a rider to the ground.

582
00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:03.201
Also, should you bear a rider
to the ground, you win his horse.

583
00:34:03.969 --> 00:34:06.071
And do men die in the joust?

584
00:34:06.204 --> 00:34:09.866
The lances points are tipped
with coronals, which blunts them.

585
00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:11.444
Of course,

586
00:34:11.808 --> 00:34:13.544
accidents happen.

587
00:34:14.546 --> 00:34:17.424
I myself, Jocelyn,
have never been unhorsed.

588
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.218
Nor have I.

589
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:24.406
Your name, lady.

590
00:34:24.906 --> 00:34:26.483
I still need to hear it.

591
00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:30.291
Sir Hunter, you persist.

592
00:34:30.428 --> 00:34:32.740
Or perhaps angels have no names,

593
00:34:32.988 --> 00:34:34.740
only beautiful faces.

594
00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:38.953
And you are?

595
00:34:39.946 --> 00:34:41.239
Well I am, um...

596
00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.982
You've forgotten?

597
00:34:43.033 --> 00:34:45.110
Or your name is Sir "Um."

598
00:34:46.411 --> 00:34:49.581
Ulrich, von Lichtenstein
from Gelderland.

599
00:34:49.915 --> 00:34:52.559
Well I'd forget as well,
What a mouthful.

600
00:34:53.468 --> 00:34:54.937
Your armor, sir.

601
00:34:55.168 --> 00:34:56.237
What about it?

602
00:34:56.354 --> 00:34:58.892
How stylish of you to
joust in an antique.

603
00:34:59.354 --> 00:35:01.292
You'll start a new
fashion if you win.

604
00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:04.604
My grandfather will be able
to wear his in public again.

605
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:06.966
And a shield...

606
00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:08.966
how quaint.

607
00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:15.466
Hyaahh!

608
00:35:18.576 --> 00:35:20.831
Some of these poor country knights,

609
00:35:21.376 --> 00:35:23.031
little better than peasants.

610
00:35:24.057 --> 00:35:25.659
The second son,

611
00:35:25.752 --> 00:35:29.821
of Sir Wallace Percival,
third Earl of Warwick.

612
00:35:29.996 --> 00:35:32.724
My lords, my ladies...

613
00:35:32.832 --> 00:35:36.461
it is with honor I introduce my liege,

614
00:35:37.337 --> 00:35:39.364
Sir Thomas Colville!

615
00:35:46.304 --> 00:35:47.806
<i>You're good.</i>

616
00:35:48.974 --> 00:35:50.475
You're very good.

617
00:35:51.952 --> 00:35:53.511
My lords!

618
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.822
My ladies...

619
00:35:59.392 --> 00:36:03.063
and everybody else here
not sitting on a cushion?!

620
00:36:09.995 --> 00:36:11.363
Today...

621
00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:13.063
to-day!

622
00:36:13.431 --> 00:36:15.417
You find yourselves equals!

623
00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:24.711
For you are all,

624
00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:26.511
equally blessed!

625
00:36:27.779 --> 00:36:30.015
For I have the pride...

626
00:36:30.991 --> 00:36:33.885
the privilege, nay, the pleasure!

627
00:36:34.186 --> 00:36:37.223
Of introducing to you a knight,

628
00:36:37.626 --> 00:36:38.793
sired by knights!

629
00:36:38.899 --> 00:36:42.277
A knight who can trace
his lineage back...

630
00:36:43.169 --> 00:36:45.197
beyond Charlemagne.

631
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.992
I first met him...

632
00:36:49.242 --> 00:36:51.453
atop a mountain near Jerusalem...

633
00:36:51.945 --> 00:36:53.872
praying to God...

634
00:36:54.472 --> 00:36:57.709
asking his forgiveness
for the saracen blood...

635
00:36:58.043 --> 00:36:59.961
spilt by his sword!

636
00:37:00.212 --> 00:37:03.340
Next, he amazed me still
further in Italy...

637
00:37:03.548 --> 00:37:05.759
when he saved a fatherless beauty...

638
00:37:06.009 --> 00:37:10.338
from the would-be ravishings
of her dreadful Turkish uncle!

639
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.897
In Greece...

640
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:21.609
he spent a year...

641
00:37:21.931 --> 00:37:23.909
in silence...

642
00:37:24.602 --> 00:37:27.972
just to better understand
the sound...

643
00:37:30.316 --> 00:37:32.343
of a whisper.

644
00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:41.920
And so without further gilding the lily
and with no more ado...

645
00:37:42.095 --> 00:37:44.923
I give to you, the seeker of serenity!

646
00:37:45.057 --> 00:37:46.306
The protector,

647
00:37:46.457 --> 00:37:48.106
of Italian virginity!

648
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:53.098
The enforcer of our Lord God,
the one, the only,

649
00:37:53.431 --> 00:37:55.035
SIR UUULLLRICH

650
00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:57.435
VON LICHTENSTEIN!!

651
00:38:10.657 --> 00:38:13.952
Thank you! Thank you!
I'll be here all week!

652
00:38:21.042 --> 00:38:22.294
Well that was different.

653
00:38:22.502 --> 00:38:24.671
Well it's time we celebrated
our differences.

654
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.082
Just maybe not in public.

655
00:38:27.883 --> 00:38:28.967
You...

656
00:38:29.342 --> 00:38:33.171
Yes, master Fowlehurst I'm well aware
a good fonging is on the way.

657
00:38:33.346 --> 00:38:35.140
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah...

658
00:38:35.515 --> 00:38:38.602
Well, I got their attention.
You go and win their hearts.

659
00:38:59.831 --> 00:39:01.166
<i>Very good.</i>

660
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:02.335
Was she watching?

661
00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:03.535
- Geoff!
- What?

662
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:05.712
- Did she see me?
- Yes, she saw you.

663
00:39:05.994 --> 00:39:08.474
- Did she see me take the hit?
- Yes, she saw you take the hit.

664
00:39:08.523 --> 00:39:10.526
- well was she concerned?
- It was dreadful, her eyes welled up.

665
00:39:10.623 --> 00:39:11.726
It was awful.

666
00:39:26.558 --> 00:39:28.595
Colville has perfect technique.

667
00:39:29.258 --> 00:39:30.563
I've never seen him before.

668
00:39:30.858 --> 00:39:31.863
Nor I.

669
00:39:32.197 --> 00:39:34.115
But this Lichtenstein.

670
00:39:34.407 --> 00:39:40.247
His technique, rudimentary style,
nonexistent. Still, he's fearless.

671
00:39:40.402 --> 00:39:41.247
Hmm...

672
00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.783
Fearless? How so?

673
00:39:43.975 --> 00:39:47.754
Slit in the helmet's visor is narrow,
but splinters can penetrate it.

674
00:39:47.963 --> 00:39:51.007
Most knights raise their chins
at the last instant.

675
00:39:51.416 --> 00:39:54.721
You lose sight of your opponent,
when you protect your eyes.

676
00:39:54.816 --> 00:39:56.421
This Ulrich doesn't.

677
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.399
He keeps his eye on the target.

678
00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:02.293
A true hunter.

679
00:40:12.153 --> 00:40:13.546
Sir Ulrich...

680
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:16.741
I'm through.

681
00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:18.787
But, um...

682
00:40:18.899 --> 00:40:21.087
I've never not finished before.

683
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.025
I wish to keep my honor...

684
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.225
intact.

685
00:40:50.483 --> 00:40:53.077
A draw. And Colville is hurt.

686
00:41:01.494 --> 00:41:03.123
Colville withdraws.

687
00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:05.723
Ulrich advances.

688
00:41:06.458 --> 00:41:08.193
Why didn't Ulrich finish him?

689
00:41:09.302 --> 00:41:10.837
He shows mercy.

690
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:14.801
Then he shows his weakness.

691
00:41:14.931 --> 00:41:16.901
That's all mercy is.

692
00:41:21.556 --> 00:41:24.643
For the love of victory,
William, go to sleep.

693
00:41:27.854 --> 00:41:29.147
I can't.

694
00:41:31.316 --> 00:41:34.319
Love has given me wings,
so I must fly.

695
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.740
I can't explain it.

696
00:41:40.859 --> 00:41:43.371
She makes me feel like a poet.

697
00:41:43.459 --> 00:41:46.248
Oh, you may feel like a poet,
but you sound like an idiot.

698
00:41:46.456 --> 00:41:48.376
You don't even know her name.

699
00:41:48.456 --> 00:41:49.376
Her name?

700
00:41:51.169 --> 00:41:53.547
Her name is Aphrodite,

701
00:41:54.005 --> 00:41:57.809
Calypso, Venus. Take your pick.

702
00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.558
Women weaken the heart.

703
00:42:06.159 --> 00:42:08.687
Without your heart, you cannot win.

704
00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:14.776
- Oh but her eyes...
- Concentrate.

705
00:42:14.926 --> 00:42:16.570
Tansy cakes!

706
00:42:19.364 --> 00:42:21.741
Count Adhemar sends word.

707
00:42:22.742 --> 00:42:26.204
He said he will win this
tournament for you.

708
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.101
He's won many tournaments.

709
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.341
He wins them for himself
and for his own honor.

710
00:42:31.459 --> 00:42:33.879
So it's nothing to say he
wins them for me.

711
00:42:35.881 --> 00:42:38.049
He wishes to speak to you again.

712
00:42:38.592 --> 00:42:40.677
Not to hear a word I say.

713
00:42:41.928 --> 00:42:44.306
Adhemar wants his women silent.

714
00:42:50.161 --> 00:42:53.315
Would you have Sir Ulrich win
this tournament for you?

715
00:42:53.665 --> 00:42:54.900
No.

716
00:42:56.209 --> 00:42:59.404
And he is the only knight who
has not promised to do so.

717
00:43:01.239 --> 00:43:03.950
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

718
00:43:04.743 --> 00:43:07.245
I would have him win my heart.

719
00:43:16.087 --> 00:43:19.591
<i>Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!</i>

720
00:43:23.762 --> 00:43:25.430
Oh, lovely.

721
00:43:26.473 --> 00:43:27.976
Count Adhemar...

722
00:43:28.073 --> 00:43:29.976
I don't think I've ever
seen him lose.

723
00:43:30.435 --> 00:43:33.438
No, but defeat him and
you'll see it firsthand.

724
00:43:35.306 --> 00:43:36.608
My liege!

725
00:43:38.376 --> 00:43:39.778
Sir Ulrich!

726
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.156
Christiana.

727
00:43:43.782 --> 00:43:46.086
My lady bids you wear this token.

728
00:43:46.382 --> 00:43:47.786
Of course!

729
00:43:48.595 --> 00:43:50.192
She also said to tell you,

730
00:43:50.495 --> 00:43:51.922
her name...

731
00:43:53.124 --> 00:43:55.260
is Jocelyn.

732
00:43:55.524 --> 00:43:57.160
Jocelyn...

733
00:43:57.712 --> 00:43:59.214
- <i>Au revoir.
- Au revoir.</i>

734
00:44:01.091 --> 00:44:03.084
Oh, Jocelyn...

735
00:44:05.804 --> 00:44:07.472
Concentrate.

736
00:45:08.504 --> 00:45:09.572
- Ohhh!!
- Aahh!!

737
00:45:17.555 --> 00:45:19.156
Haahh!!

738
00:45:29.555 --> 00:45:30.156
<i>Whoaahh...</i>

739
00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:31.156
I can't breathe.

740
00:45:39.397 --> 00:45:41.274
No style whatsoever.

741
00:45:42.734 --> 00:45:44.569
But neither has an anvil.

742
00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.508
whooh!  He hits like a hammer.
It's Amazing!

743
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:49.908
But not perfect. He aims
high on your chest.

744
00:45:50.158 --> 00:45:53.118
Roll your shoulder back, when you strike
his blow may glance to your right.

745
00:45:53.161 --> 00:45:56.402
Oh if he strikes on the right, he'll be
striking on the left, I'll be obliterated.

746
00:45:56.706 --> 00:45:58.700
Didn't say I want to gamble

747
00:46:20.524 --> 00:46:21.836
Eeyeahh!!

748
00:46:24.224 --> 00:46:25.336
Ohh...

749
00:46:39.124 --> 00:46:42.836
<i>Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich...!</i>

750
00:47:14.424 --> 00:47:15.636
Yah! Yaahh!!

751
00:47:34.446 --> 00:47:36.880
<i>Willi-am?!</i>

752
00:47:38.046 --> 00:47:39.880
William?!

753
00:47:42.422 --> 00:47:43.123
William!

754
00:47:43.622 --> 00:47:45.023
William, here!

755
00:47:46.825 --> 00:47:47.859
Come on, come 'ere.

756
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.771
Someday, I'll be a knight.

757
00:48:00.414 --> 00:48:03.208
A thatcher's son? A knight?

758
00:48:03.542 --> 00:48:06.978
You might as well try
to change the stars!

759
00:48:08.255 --> 00:48:10.090
Can it be done, Father?

760
00:48:10.382 --> 00:48:12.385
Can a man change the stars?

761
00:48:12.582 --> 00:48:13.985
Yes, William.

762
00:48:14.177 --> 00:48:17.138
If he believes enough,
a man can do anything.

763
00:48:26.277 --> 00:48:27.738
Wh-Wh-Whoah, whooahh!

764
00:48:36.908 --> 00:48:38.285
Come here.

765
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:48.253
Gain more bearing, Ulrich.

766
00:48:48.962 --> 00:48:50.964
See me again when you're worthy.

767
00:48:56.403 --> 00:48:58.138
I'll fong you in the
hole of your arse!

768
00:48:58.503 --> 00:48:59.238
Fong your...Aaghh!!

769
00:48:59.431 --> 00:49:01.142
- Oof!
- Well done, my lord!

770
00:49:01.531 --> 00:49:02.342
Well done!

771
00:49:02.734 --> 00:49:04.828
- You bastard!
- Go and see to Ulrich!

772
00:49:04.936 --> 00:49:06.771
Go, and see to Ulrich!

773
00:49:10.483 --> 00:49:12.110
Well done, my lord!

774
00:49:12.652 --> 00:49:14.279
A noble victory.

775
00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:22.996
My lady, I believe this is yours.

776
00:49:29.336 --> 00:49:31.963
For long spear on foot...

777
00:49:32.339 --> 00:49:34.841
Pandolfo Malatesta.

778
00:49:39.971 --> 00:49:44.351
For sword on foot,
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

779
00:49:49.022 --> 00:49:53.818
And finally, for the mounted joust
and tournament champion...

780
00:49:54.152 --> 00:49:56.988
Adhemar, Count of Anjou.

781
00:49:58.657 --> 00:50:01.535
<i>Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar!</!>

782
00:50:04.162 --> 00:50:08.208
I present to you your champions.

783
00:50:13.046 --> 00:50:15.676
Next time I face you, Count Adhemar...

784
00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.806
you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.

785
00:50:17.884 --> 00:50:21.930
Please. You have been weighed,
you have been measured...

786
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.182
and you have been found wanting.

787
00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:34.310
Keep winning the sword,
and we'll be rich!

788
00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:35.978
I won't compete in the sword again.

789
00:50:36.071 --> 00:50:36.978
It's your best event!

790
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.698
No! It's tournament champion
or nothing at all.

791
00:50:45.203 --> 00:50:47.747
Ten florins. That should do.

792
00:50:50.584 --> 00:50:52.912
It's sixes and sevens tonight, Chaucer.

793
00:50:53.084 --> 00:50:54.312
Do you feel lucky?

794
00:50:54.546 --> 00:50:56.417
Do you wear enough clothes?

795
00:50:56.546 --> 00:50:59.017
Go on, begone I'm done with you.

796
00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:01.895
Except to exact my revenge.

797
00:51:01.991 --> 00:51:03.695
Mmm?...

798
00:51:04.556 --> 00:51:08.059
What on earth could you
possibly do to us?

799
00:51:08.435 --> 00:51:10.729
I will eviscerate you in fiction.

800
00:51:11.062 --> 00:51:14.499
Every last pimple,
every last character flaw.

801
00:51:14.854 --> 00:51:16.912
I was naked for a day.

802
00:51:17.504 --> 00:51:19.512
You will be naked for eternity.

803
00:51:20.115 --> 00:51:22.507
I have a feeling we shall meet again.

804
00:51:25.343 --> 00:51:26.513
Here, farris,

805
00:51:26.743 --> 00:51:28.113
take what we owe you.

806
00:51:28.994 --> 00:51:30.484
The armor you wear,

807
00:51:31.314 --> 00:51:33.084
t'wasn't made for you, was it?

808
00:51:34.369 --> 00:51:35.629
So, what of it?

809
00:51:35.795 --> 00:51:39.157
I could make such armor you
wouldn't even know you wore it.

810
00:51:39.307 --> 00:51:41.342
And how much would that cost me?

811
00:51:42.027 --> 00:51:44.137
Just take me as far as Paris.

812
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:48.058
We travel alone.
Take your gold and go.

813
00:51:56.483 --> 00:51:59.946
Get what you can out of that,
the rest of us will pack camp.

814
00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:01.146
Why we leaving so soon?

815
00:52:01.279 --> 00:52:04.284
Tournament at Lagny-sur-Marne
starts in a week.

816
00:52:04.379 --> 00:52:06.984
We leave now we can walk most
of the way and save the horse.

817
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.538
No, You have to go to banquet tonight. You have
to dance. You have to make an appearance.

818
00:52:10.688 --> 00:52:12.457
Oh, and have Adhemar
laugh at me again? No!

819
00:52:12.607 --> 00:52:13.609
- No!
- Yes!

820
00:52:13.907 --> 00:52:14.609
- Yes!
- No!

821
00:52:14.937 --> 00:52:15.709
- Yes!
- No!

822
00:52:15.907 --> 00:52:16.709
- Yes!
- No!

823
00:52:16.807 --> 00:52:17.709
A-hem, ahem!

824
00:52:17.807 --> 00:52:19.199
- Yes!
- No!

825
00:52:21.066 --> 00:52:24.411
My lady would know the color
of your lord's tunic tonight.

826
00:52:25.436 --> 00:52:26.507
His tunic?

827
00:52:26.996 --> 00:52:29.607
Yes, so she can dress to match him.

828
00:52:29.883 --> 00:52:33.428
Uh w-we regret to inform your lady
that he won't actually be attending...

829
00:52:33.528 --> 00:52:35.823
Herald, do not answer questions
you don't know the answer to!

830
00:52:35.928 --> 00:52:37.023
Absolutely, my lord.

831
00:52:37.232 --> 00:52:38.917
Uhh squire, answer her.

832
00:52:39.242 --> 00:52:43.021
What uhh... color is my tunic... tonight.

833
00:52:44.292 --> 00:52:46.268
Uhh...

834
00:52:47.192 --> 00:52:48.468
Green

835
00:52:49.112 --> 00:52:50.368
umm...

836
00:52:50.537 --> 00:52:52.247
Trimmed in a kind of...

837
00:52:52.539 --> 00:52:55.332
pale... green...

838
00:52:56.167 --> 00:52:57.502
uh... with-with...

839
00:52:57.878 --> 00:53:00.405
uh, wooden toggles.

840
00:53:01.673 --> 00:53:03.508
I will tell my lady.

841
00:53:10.015 --> 00:53:11.410
Ooh this is a disaster!

842
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.910
No, it'll tunic up quite nicely,
give us your dagger Wat.

843
00:53:14.019 --> 00:53:16.021
That's not a disaster, Roland.

844
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.826
I don't know how to dance.

845
00:53:24.129 --> 00:53:27.699
And one and two and three and four.

846
00:53:28.074 --> 00:53:31.369
<i>And your hand should be light,
like a birdie on a branch.

847
00:53:31.703 --> 00:53:35.207
And one, two and three and four.

848
00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:39.710
And Wat doesn't lead,
he follows like a girl.

849
00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:48.710
Ooff!

850
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.130
Aaand...

851
00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.120
One, and two, and...

852
00:53:52.265 --> 00:53:53.892
twirlie, twirlie, twirlie.

853
00:53:54.267 --> 00:53:57.395
And one, and two, and you're
still gettin' it wrong.

854
00:53:57.729 --> 00:54:01.441
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

855
00:54:01.775 --> 00:54:05.270
You can hit me all day
'cause you punch like a what?

856
00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.613
A girl.

857
00:54:06.805 --> 00:54:08.507
- That's enough o' that!
- Hey get back! Roland...

858
00:54:08.649 --> 00:54:12.049
- I'm doin' this for you! He starts it everytime...
- Roland quiet! You know he doesn't like that!

859
00:54:13.954 --> 00:54:16.456
Oh, and you can do better can you?

860
00:54:16.614 --> 00:54:17.792
Of course I can.

861
00:54:17.914 --> 00:54:19.892
Good! Why don't you show us then.

862
00:54:20.677 --> 00:54:21.420
No.

863
00:54:22.827 --> 00:54:23.420
No!

864
00:54:23.588 --> 00:54:28.176
Look If I'm going through all this effort,
you better learn to dance now ask her nicely

865
00:54:33.064 --> 00:54:34.990
I'm sorry, Kate.

866
00:54:38.203 --> 00:54:42.907
I was wondering if... you would
care to... show us how to dance.

867
00:54:43.333 --> 00:54:44.121
Please.

868
00:54:44.325 --> 00:54:45.901
<i>Please.</i>

869
00:54:46.879 --> 00:54:49.383
<i>Aaand one and two,

870
00:54:49.779 --> 00:54:51.283
three and four.

871
00:54:51.658 --> 00:54:53.561
Five, six, seven,

872
00:54:53.698 --> 00:54:54.861
change partners!

873
00:54:54.953 --> 00:54:58.290
<i>And a one, two, three, four...</i>

874
00:54:58.623 --> 00:55:01.724
five, six, seven... Polonaise!

875
00:55:01.824 --> 00:55:03.869
And one...

876
00:55:04.245 --> 00:55:06.464
You're not going to wear
your hair like that, are you?

877
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:09.101
Is there another way?

878
00:55:38.371 --> 00:55:39.534
Sir Ulrich...

879
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:42.434
you look fantastic.

880
00:55:45.337 --> 00:55:47.464
Jocelyn, you look...

881
00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:51.584
Uh, you...

882
00:55:54.964 --> 00:55:56.906
You remind me of the Bible.

883
00:56:01.978 --> 00:56:04.358
When God stopped the sun
in the sky at Gibeon to

884
00:56:04.358 --> 00:56:07.058
give Joshua more time to
defeat the Amorites.

885
00:56:10.028 --> 00:56:11.963
I don't understand.

886
00:56:16.368 --> 00:56:19.079
If I could ask God one thing...

887
00:56:19.704 --> 00:56:21.998
it would be to stop the moon.

888
00:56:23.875 --> 00:56:26.753
Stop the moon and make <i>this</i> night...

889
00:56:28.046 --> 00:56:29.714
and your beauty...

890
00:56:30.482 --> 00:56:32.092
last forever.

891
00:56:34.219 --> 00:56:36.556
So what dance will you have?

892
00:56:36.719 --> 00:56:37.956
A coranto?

893
00:56:38.557 --> 00:56:40.559
Or a basse dance?

894
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.103
<i>Sir Ulrich!</i>

895
00:56:44.896 --> 00:56:48.024
Why don't you show us all
the dance of your country?

896
00:56:48.775 --> 00:56:50.969
Show us a dance of Gelderland.

897
00:56:52.471 --> 00:56:55.240
- Oh...
- Yes. Gelderland.

898
00:56:56.411 --> 00:56:57.547
Uhh...

900
00:57:03.782 --> 00:57:06.418
but with some differences... um

901
00:57:07.586 --> 00:57:09.588
Well, you should bow.

902
00:57:13.925 --> 00:57:15.468
And...

903
00:57:17.125 --> 00:57:18.168

01:00:54.646 --> 01:00:55.814
What?

934
01:00:56.048 --> 01:00:59.487
Uhh... I don't know.
It's-it's too small,

935
01:00:59.648 --> 01:01:00.787
it's too light.

936
01:01:00.888 --> 01:01:02.687
He'll be crushed, killed.

937
01:01:02.821 --> 01:01:03.750
No.

938
01:01:03.821 --> 01:01:05.700
I found a new way to heat the steel.

939
01:01:05.821 --> 01:01:07.450
It's thinner, smaller...

940
01:01:07.859 --> 01:01:09.527
but just as strong.

941
01:01:09.619 --> 01:01:10.987
Wha' are these?

942
01:01:11.162 --> 01:01:14.833
The marks of me trade, should
another knight admire the armor.

943
01:01:17.377 --> 01:01:20.672
Twist, bend, feel the movement.

944
01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:21.672
Alright...

945
01:01:22.299 --> 01:01:23.699
But eventually I will be struck.

946
01:01:23.799 --> 01:01:25.677
And then death.

947
01:01:26.494 --> 01:01:29.055
Do you at least have
the courage to test it?

948
01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:40.012
Are you alright Wil?

949
01:01:41.026 --> 01:01:43.294
I didn't feel a thing!

950
01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:05.924
Hmph!

951
01:02:09.763 --> 01:02:11.124
What's the name of that knight?

952
01:02:11.263 --> 01:02:12.724
Piers Courtenay.

953
01:02:13.016 --> 01:02:17.229
He's... uh... raised taxes on his land 3
times this year to pay for tournament.

954
01:02:17.437 --> 01:02:20.273
His people starve while
he sits at banquet.

955
01:02:24.085 --> 01:02:25.295
It's probably true.

956
01:02:31.085 --> 01:02:32.595
- Hyaah!!
- Hooaaah!!

957
01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:48.166
- Yeah!
- Ohh!

958
01:02:59.871 --> 01:03:00.267
Haahh!!

959
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:02.567
<i>Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich!</i>

960
01:03:02.621 --> 01:03:03.366
Hyahh!

961
01:03:03.608 --> 01:03:06.236
Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

962
01:03:07.754 --> 01:03:09.739
My lord the Count Adhemar...

963
01:03:09.906 --> 01:03:12.050
son of Philippe de Vitry...

964
01:03:12.284 --> 01:03:14.752
son of Gill... es...

965
01:03:15.612 --> 01:03:17.213
master of the free companies...

966
01:03:17.597 --> 01:03:19.175
defender of his...

967
01:03:19.497 --> 01:03:20.975
enormous manhood...

968
01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:23.728
a shining example of chivalry...

969
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.797
and champagne!

970
01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.803
<i>Nice work!</i>

971
01:03:33.263 --> 01:03:34.598
Bravo!

972
01:03:37.263 --> 01:03:37.898
My lords...

973
01:03:38.059 --> 01:03:41.229
Watch every move Adhemar makes.
If theres a weakness, we'll find it.

974
01:03:41.438 --> 01:03:43.306
And Colville looks fit.
This should be good.

975
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.608
<i>My liege...</i>

976
01:03:44.816 --> 01:03:47.611
<i>The second son of
Sir Wallace Percival.</i>

977
01:03:47.819 --> 01:03:50.614
It is my deepest honor...

978
01:03:54.117 --> 01:03:56.969
My deepest honor
to present to you...

979
01:03:57.262 --> 01:03:58.623
It's Edward, my lord!

980
01:03:58.762 --> 01:03:59.823
They're sure of it.

981
01:04:00.092 --> 01:04:02.123
<i>...The third Earl of Warwick,
I give you...</i>

982
01:04:02.268 --> 01:04:04.630
<i>...the noble, the illustrious...</i>

983
01:04:05.068 --> 01:04:07.130
<i>Sir Thomas Colville!</i>

984
01:04:22.579 --> 01:04:24.147
Adhemar withdrew.

985
01:04:24.481 --> 01:04:27.025
To withdraw like could
mean only one thing.

986
01:04:28.493 --> 01:04:29.619
Royalty.

987
01:04:39.704 --> 01:04:41.706
I'll see what I can find out.

988
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.310
Prepare to drop ze flag!

989
01:04:45.418 --> 01:04:48.255
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
Not yet, not yet...Wait,</i>

990
01:04:48.505 --> 01:04:50.265
- Listen, listen to me...</i>
- Musicians, announce!

991
01:04:50.423 --> 01:04:52.685
Wait, wait I must speak with my lord.

992
01:04:52.823 --> 01:04:53.885
Then go.

993
01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:56.680
And see if you can beat
ze Second Coming eh?!

994
01:04:57.681 --> 01:04:59.349
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

995
01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:02.364
Colville is Edward,

996
01:05:02.601 --> 01:05:04.164
the Black Prince of Wales,

997
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.794
and future King of England.

998
01:05:05.997 --> 01:05:08.191
Oh, he's in disguise like me
so he can compete.

999
01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.040
He has never met an
enemy without victory,

1000
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.495
he has never attacked a
town he could not defeat.

1001
01:05:12.645 --> 01:05:14.447
We're English Geoff!
We know who he is!

1002
01:05:14.698 --> 01:05:16.976
You must withdraw Will. Go tell them Geoff,
they were about to drop the flag!

1003
01:05:17.098 --> 01:05:18.076
Absolutely!

1004
01:05:18.326 --> 01:05:19.544
<i>Here, give me the lance.</i>

1005
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:28.844
Give me the lance!
Give me the la...

1006
01:05:28.944 --> 01:05:29.944
Hyahh!

1007
01:05:35.552 --> 01:05:36.720
Lance!

1008
01:05:50.901 --> 01:05:53.069
Oh, my giddy aunt.

1009
01:05:57.507 --> 01:05:59.951
The match, is a draw!

1010
01:06:03.121 --> 01:06:06.065
Are you mad? You knowingly endanger
a member of the royal family

1011
01:06:06.366 --> 01:06:08.526
He knowingly endangers himself.

1012
01:06:08.919 --> 01:06:10.521
Well fought, Sir Ulrich,

1013
01:06:10.889 --> 01:06:12.221
as it was in Rouen.

1014
01:06:13.623 --> 01:06:15.475
And you also, Prince Edward.

1015
01:06:20.714 --> 01:06:21.866
You knew me?

1016
01:06:21.914 --> 01:06:22.966
Yeah.

1017
01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:28.379
And still you rode?

1018
01:06:29.147 --> 01:06:30.851
It's not in me to withdraw.

1019
01:06:31.147 --> 01:06:33.651
Ehh...Nor me.

1020
01:06:35.695 --> 01:06:37.405
Though it happens.

1021
01:06:39.783 --> 01:06:41.193
Yes, it does.

1022
01:06:43.753 --> 01:06:45.223
Good luck with the tournament.

1023
01:06:45.553 --> 01:06:46.723
And you also.

1024
01:06:49.167 --> 01:06:51.438
The winner of the mounted joust...

1025
01:06:51.667 --> 01:06:53.538
and tournament champion...

1026
01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:55.982
Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

1027
01:07:01.972 --> 01:07:04.408
Here. Melt it down, sell it,
do whatever you do.

1028
01:07:04.612 --> 01:07:05.508
Yes, Your Majesty.

1029
01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.768
William, you're tournament champion!

1030
01:07:06.977 --> 01:07:10.221
I'm not champion until I defeat Adhemar.
Adhemar withdrew!

1031
01:07:10.313 --> 01:07:11.648
Sir Ulrich!

1032
01:07:11.813 --> 01:07:12.648
Oh...

1033
01:07:12.983 --> 01:07:15.520
I've come to see what you'll
wear to banquet tonight.

1034
01:07:15.783 --> 01:07:16.920
...Nothing.

1035
01:07:17.195 --> 01:07:19.990
Oh then we'll cause a sensation,
for I'll dress to match.

1036
01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.784
Oh don't you ever get tired
of putting on clothes?!

1037
01:07:22.993 --> 01:07:25.495
Um... I believe she's talking
about taking them off.

1038
01:07:27.372 --> 01:07:30.333
A flower is only as good
as its petals, don't you think?

1039
01:07:30.709 --> 01:07:32.935
A flower is good for nothing.

1040
01:07:34.838 --> 01:07:36.047
Really?

1041
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.035
You can't eat a flower.
A... f-flower doesn't keep you warm...

1042
01:07:40.135 --> 01:07:43.997
And a rose never knocked a man
off a horse either, did it?

1043
01:07:45.932 --> 01:07:48.643
You're just a silly girl, aren't you?

1044
01:07:51.955 --> 01:07:57.035
Better a silly girl with a flower than
a silly boy with a horse and a stick.

1045
01:08:01.364 --> 01:08:02.699
Goodbye then.

1046
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:08.972
It's called a lance!

1047
01:08:09.247 --> 01:08:10.707
Hellooo?

1048
01:08:31.047 --> 01:08:32.607
- Yeahh!!

1049
01:08:36.547 --> 01:08:37.707
<i>Pffft!!</i>

1050
01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:43.407
I have word.

1051
01:08:43.739 --> 01:08:44.507
What?

1052
01:08:44.641 --> 01:08:47.377
Adhemar's been called back
to the free companies.

1053
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:50.530
The Black Prince commanded it.
He could be gone all season.

1054
01:08:51.514 --> 01:08:54.651
First Jocelyn and now Adhemar.

1055
01:08:56.614 --> 01:08:57.851
Nooo!!!

1056
01:09:00.123 --> 01:09:01.299
Well done.

1057
01:09:01.691 --> 01:09:03.760
Yeah, well done.

1058
01:09:04.791 --> 01:09:06.160
What?...I...

1059
01:09:14.437 --> 01:09:16.773
The, uh... tournament results, my lord.

1060
01:09:29.786 --> 01:09:30.954
Ulrich...

1061
01:09:31.788 --> 01:09:33.123
Ulrich...

1062
01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:35.125
Ulrich...

1063
01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:37.125
Ulrich...

1064
01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.125
Ulrich...

1065
01:09:40.057 --> 01:09:41.125
Ulrich...

1066
01:09:52.844 --> 01:09:53.612
Uhm!!

1067
01:09:54.244 --> 01:09:55.012
<i>Geoff!</i>

1068
01:09:55.314 --> 01:09:56.042
William!

1069
01:09:56.146 --> 01:09:57.814
I need to write a letter.

1070
01:09:58.398 --> 01:10:01.267
"Dear Jocelyn...." No...
"My dearest Jocelyn."

1071
01:10:01.359 --> 01:10:02.636
Better.

1072
01:10:02.759 --> 01:10:03.736
Um...

1073
01:10:06.406 --> 01:10:07.274
"I miss you."

1074
01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:10.602
Oh, hold... uh, w-was that wrong?

1075
01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:12.881
Well... i-i-i-it-it's up to you,
really, um...

1076
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:15.581
er...It's your funeral,
I mean, letter.

1077
01:10:16.366 --> 01:10:18.002
Say something about her breasts.

1078
01:10:18.166 --> 01:10:19.402
Yeah you miss her breasts.

1079
01:10:19.996 --> 01:10:21.479
Her breasts?

1080
01:10:22.088 --> 01:10:24.893
Yes... you... you could... um... but...

1081
01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:27.493
I... I would tend to look above
her breasts William.

1082
01:10:28.512 --> 01:10:30.322
I... I miss her throat?

1083
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:32.966
Perhaps still higher, really.
Towards the heavens?

1084
01:10:33.016 --> 01:10:35.652
The moon at least, her breasts
were not that impressive.

1085
01:10:35.716 --> 01:10:36.052
Heh!

1086
01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:38.355
- The moon?
- The moon...

1087
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:43.568
"It is strange to think...

1088
01:10:45.195 --> 01:10:47.364
I haven't seen you since a month.

1089
01:10:50.033 --> 01:10:53.370
I have seen the new moon, but not you.

1090
01:10:55.539 --> 01:11:00.252
I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but
nothing of your beautiful face."

1091
01:11:04.548 --> 01:11:06.550
That's very good William.

1092
01:11:07.425 --> 01:11:09.886
I used to know this girl once who...

1093
01:11:11.221 --> 01:11:13.557
W-Well she broke my heart.
But I used to say the pieces...

1094
01:11:13.807 --> 01:11:18.478
"The pieces of my broken heart are so mall that
hey can be passed through the eye of a needle."

1095
01:11:21.565 --> 01:11:23.650
He writes as though I had died.

1096
01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.703
Yes, ma'am.

1097
01:11:25.903 --> 01:11:27.303
He dies as well.

1098
01:11:28.772 --> 01:11:31.241
She used to cook for the Duke of York.

1099
01:11:34.244 --> 01:11:37.622
I miss her like the sun
misses the flower.

1100
01:11:38.081 --> 01:11:41.084
"I miss you like the sun
misses the flower.

1101
01:11:41.793 --> 01:11:45.422
Like the sun misses the flower
in the depths of winter.

1102
01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:50.302
Instead of beauty
to direct its light to...

1103
01:11:50.927 --> 01:11:55.473
the heart hardens like the frozen
world your absence has banished me to."

1104
01:11:55.765 --> 01:11:58.067
<i>"I next compete in the city of Paris.</i>

1105
01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:01.938
I will find it empty and in the winter
if you are not there."

1106
01:12:03.206 --> 01:12:04.908
I like it.

1107
01:12:05.642 --> 01:12:07.811
And now to finish it.

1108
01:12:08.987 --> 01:12:10.614
With "hope."

1109
01:12:11.448 --> 01:12:13.617
Love should end with hope.

1110
01:12:14.951 --> 01:12:17.787
My husband, God rest him...

1111
01:12:18.205 --> 01:12:20.457
told me something I will never forget.

1112
01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:23.793
"Hope guides me"

1113
01:12:24.044 --> 01:12:27.547
"It is what gets me through the day
and especially the night.

1114
01:12:28.632 --> 01:12:31.134
The hope that after you are gone
from my sight...

1115
01:12:31.384 --> 01:12:34.179
it will not be the last time
I look upon you."

1116
01:12:37.974 --> 01:12:39.684
And finish it with...

1117
01:12:40.352 --> 01:12:42.864
"With all the love
that I possess...

1118
01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:45.064
William."

1119
01:12:46.224 --> 01:12:47.908
You mean "Ulrich."

1120
01:12:49.569 --> 01:12:52.063
<i>"With all the love
that I possess...</i>

1121
01:12:53.532 --> 01:12:55.367
I remain yours...

1122
01:12:56.243 --> 01:12:58.245
the knight of your heart."

1123
01:13:07.212 --> 01:13:11.983
M-my master... hoped you might have
something to send him in return.

1124
01:13:23.289 --> 01:13:25.796
Cock-a-doodle once!
I shall not deny him.

1125
01:13:25.906 --> 01:13:28.806
Cock-a-doodle twice!
I shall not deny him.

1126
01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:30.986
Cock-a-doodle thrice!!

1127
01:13:31.778 --> 01:13:33.363
I deny him.

1128
01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:36.156
Thrice he denied him,

1129
01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.956
thrice! Of the third, of which that is
the very leg of this... this bird...

1130
01:13:41.246 --> 01:13:42.789
No Adhemar.

1131
01:13:44.457 --> 01:13:45.667
No Adhemar.

1132
01:13:45.997 --> 01:13:47.467
<i>Woohooo!!</i>

1133
01:13:48.057 --> 01:13:49.067
Whoah.

1134
01:13:51.339 --> 01:13:52.507
Wat.

1135
01:13:52.939 --> 01:13:53.807
Heh!

1136
01:13:55.635 --> 01:13:57.580
Wat, tell me, did you see her?

1137
01:13:57.935 --> 01:13:58.980
Did she read the letter?

1138
01:13:59.397 --> 01:14:01.799
Yes, and yes.

1139
01:14:02.017 --> 01:14:02.976
And!?

1140
01:14:04.817 --> 01:14:05.876
Uhh...

1141
01:14:09.065 --> 01:14:10.525
...She's coming to Paris!

1142
01:14:14.154 --> 01:14:16.183
Well, did she give you anything
for me in return? Did she...

1143
01:14:16.284 --> 01:14:17.503
did she give you a letter?

1144
01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:18.983
Or a token?

1145
01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:20.169
Did she give me a token?

1146
01:14:20.209 --> 01:14:21.661
- Yes...
- She did.

1147
01:14:21.779 --> 01:14:22.661
Um...

1148
01:14:22.769 --> 01:14:23.661
Y-Yeah...

1149
01:14:24.039 --> 01:14:25.673
Y-uh, I mean, um...

1150
01:14:25.957 --> 01:14:27.068
Well, what is it, Wat?

1151
01:14:27.457 --> 01:14:28.768
Come on, give it to me.

1152
01:14:37.469 --> 01:14:38.803
Y-Yeeess!!

1153
01:14:39.869 --> 01:14:40.803
Yeahh!! Ho-hoo!

1154
01:14:41.181 --> 01:14:42.807
Hell, yeah!

1155
01:14:43.842 --> 01:14:47.979
Ye... she... k... his m... ah!
That means she... Yeah!

1156
01:14:48.042 --> 01:14:48.879
Yes!

1157
01:14:48.982 --> 01:14:50.079
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1158
01:14:51.916 --> 01:14:53.193
<i>Cinquante?</i>

1159
01:14:54.319 --> 01:14:55.946
That's a nice round number.

1160
01:14:56.696 --> 01:14:57.906
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1161
01:15:00.618 --> 01:15:01.472
All right.

1162
01:15:01.618 --> 01:15:05.872
The wager they wish to make is that a Frenchman,
and not Sir Ulrich, will win the tournament.

1163
01:15:07.624 --> 01:15:09.334
However, the amount is 50 florins.

1164
01:15:09.584 --> 01:15:10.504
That's all we got.

1165
01:15:10.604 --> 01:15:12.504
Yes and if we had sixty,
the bet would be sixty.

1166
01:15:12.612 --> 01:15:15.215
Even money, but Ulrich against
every Frenchman here?

1167
01:15:15.465 --> 01:15:16.177
Oh, come on!

1168
01:15:16.465 --> 01:15:19.300
He's won four tournaments in a row,
a-and once again Adhemar is not here

1169
01:15:19.286 --> 01:15:21.089
check shields too.

1170
01:15:21.186 --> 01:15:22.389
John Beaumont's here.

1171
01:15:22.439 --> 01:15:26.268
Count Theobald of Chartres, Philip of Burgundy...
all three French champions.

1172
01:15:26.518 --> 01:15:28.019
An Englishmen will not win...

1173
01:15:28.228 --> 01:15:30.021
this French tournament.

1174
01:15:30.397 --> 01:15:34.025
English legs are unsteady
on French soil.

1175
01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:35.325
- <i>Parlez-moi!</i>
- Shush yer mou...

1176
01:15:36.528 --> 01:15:38.697
Why don't ya shut your mouth,
all right?!

1177
01:15:40.365 --> 01:15:43.214
Come on, Roland.
It's a good bet.

1178
01:15:43.315 --> 01:15:44.944
Win, and I can buy my own tavern.

1179
01:15:45.078 --> 01:15:46.414
I could write full-time.

1180
01:15:46.578 --> 01:15:48.104
And a forge for me.

1181
01:15:48.206 --> 01:15:52.711
Yes, and because French wine
is too much for English bellies.

1182
01:15:53.086 --> 01:15:58.308
A'right, I'm about this fonging close, mate.
I swear to God, Quasimodo! I oughta...

1183
01:15:58.492 --> 01:16:02.888
Listen, all I want is to go home, and I already
have enough to make that trip a hundred times.

1184
01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:07.767
And most importantly, because
the Pope himself is French!

1185
01:16:10.395 --> 01:16:13.690
Well, the pope may be French,
but Jesus is English. You're on!

1186
01:16:13.765 --> 01:16:14.690
- YEAH!! -

1187
01:16:14.733 --> 01:16:17.277
He won't lose, not with the
Princess 'ere watchin' 'im.

1188
01:16:17.527 --> 01:16:19.529
<i>♪ He's blond! He's pissed! ♪</i>

1189
01:16:19.738 --> 01:16:24.451
<i>♪ He'll see you in the lists!
Lichtenstein! Lichtenstein! ♪</i>

1190
01:16:24.701 --> 01:16:28.246
<i>♪ He's blond! He's tan!
He comes from Gelderland! ♪</i>

1191
01:16:28.622 --> 01:16:30.624
<i>♪ He comes from Gelderland! ♪</i>

1192
01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:33.103
<i>♪ Gelderland! ♪</i>

1193
01:16:33.216 --> 01:16:36.193
<i>♪ Gelderland, Gerderland! ♪</i>

1194
01:16:36.316 --> 01:16:39.593
<i>♪ Gelderland, Gerderland!
Gerderlaaand... ♪</i>

1195
01:16:49.267 --> 01:16:50.971
Do you think he will come?

1196
01:16:51.167 --> 01:16:53.271
As sure as the sun will rise.

1197
01:17:18.964 --> 01:17:20.799
You favor Cathedrals.

1198
01:17:23.468 --> 01:17:25.345
I come for confession.

1199
01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.642
And the glass.

1200
01:17:31.476 --> 01:17:34.813
A riot of color in a
dreary, gray world.

1201
01:17:35.981 --> 01:17:37.482
Don't you think?

1202
01:17:38.525 --> 01:17:40.151
Well, it's beautiful.

1203
01:17:44.322 --> 01:17:47.158
I feel the same way about
the letter you sent.

1204
01:17:50.036 --> 01:17:51.663
Speak to me.

1205
01:17:52.330 --> 01:17:54.165
Speak those words.

1206
01:17:56.376 --> 01:17:58.670
I'm going to win this tournament for you.

1207
01:17:59.462 --> 01:18:00.505
Excuse me?

1208
01:18:00.714 --> 01:18:03.019
Uh... this tournament,
I'll win it in your name.

1209
01:18:03.214 --> 01:18:05.719
Every knight I defeat,
I defeat for you.

1210
01:18:06.052 --> 01:18:11.016
Th... your beauty will be reflected in the
power of my arm, the flanks of my horse.

1211
01:18:12.058 --> 01:18:13.393
Wow.

1212
01:18:14.519 --> 01:18:15.854
- Really?
- Yes.

1213
01:18:16.354 --> 01:18:18.690
Really? Its flanks?

1214
01:18:19.154 --> 01:18:20.690
Y-Yes...

1215
01:18:22.027 --> 01:18:24.571
I wish to hear poetry, Ulrich.

1216
01:18:24.727 --> 01:18:25.571
Ohh...

1217
01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:28.033
Well, I'm not ready.

1218
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:31.197
But I am.

1219
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:33.997
And why must everything for a
woman be run on a man's schedule?

1220
01:18:34.206 --> 01:18:37.709
Well...uh, a man's day is fuller, and...

1221
01:18:38.084 --> 01:18:41.187
well you see a man, he has
more demands on his time.

1222
01:18:41.421 --> 01:18:42.423
Is that so?

1223
01:18:42.521 --> 01:18:43.423
Yes...

1224
01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:45.558
Maybe...

1225
01:18:46.593 --> 01:18:47.719
No?

1226
01:18:48.053 --> 01:18:50.430
I demand poetry,

1227
01:18:51.223 --> 01:18:53.892
and when I want it.
And I want it now.

1228
01:18:57.062 --> 01:18:58.563
<i>Your breasts...</i>

1229
01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.400
they're below your throat...

1230
01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.400
where... Damn!

1231
01:19:03.568 --> 01:19:06.539
Jocelyn, how may I prove
my love to you?

1232
01:19:06.968 --> 01:19:07.739
How?

1233
01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:12.345
Do you ask in earnest?

1234
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.745
Yes.

1235
01:19:17.582 --> 01:19:18.822
If you would prove your love...

1236
01:19:18.982 --> 01:19:19.960
Right...

1237
01:19:20.627 --> 01:19:22.221
You should do your worst.

1238
01:19:22.327 --> 01:19:23.421
My worst...

1239
01:19:25.090 --> 01:19:26.424
...W-What do you mean?

1240
01:19:26.925 --> 01:19:31.763
Instead of winning, to honor me
with your high reputation...

1241
01:19:32.138 --> 01:19:34.933
I want you to act against your
normal character and do badly.

1242
01:19:35.267 --> 01:19:36.643
- Do badly?
- Lose!

1243
01:19:36.893 --> 01:19:38.895
L-Losing proves nothing,
except that I'm a loser!

1244
01:19:39.104 --> 01:19:42.649
Wrong! Losing is a much
keener test of your love.

1245
01:19:42.941 --> 01:19:45.443
Losing would contradict
your self-love.

1246
01:19:45.719 --> 01:19:49.481
And losing would show your obedience

Now be gone! Go!

1250
01:20:05.223 --> 01:20:07.432

1251
01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.938

That their legs haven't been
uncrossed for nothing.

1280
01:22:23.894 --> 01:22:25.598

uncrossed her legs.

1446
01:35:21.271 --> 01:35:22.421
I have news.

1447
01:35:22.571 --> 01:35:24.101
Adhemar's here.
He's entered.

1448
01:35:24.301 --> 01:35:26.301
He'd grown bored with
whatever war they're fightin'.

1449
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:28.614
No, no the Black Prince commanded it.

1450
01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.514
He was forced to disband his army.

1451
01:35:30.764 --> 01:35:33.808
They were revelling in the night,
pillaging town after town.

1452
01:35:34.017 --> 01:35:37.195
Robbing, and murdering,
and ransacking churches...

1453
01:35:37.387 --> 01:35:39.708
<i>Committing the oldest sins...</i>

1454
01:35:39.907 --> 01:35:41.358
in the newest ways.

1455
01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.404
At last we'll have the chance to face
each other again, Sir Ulrich.

1456
01:35:46.696 --> 01:35:48.490
And at the World Championship.

1457
01:35:48.698 --> 01:35:50.900
As I promised you before Adhemar...

1458
01:35:51.034 --> 01:35:53.745
you will look up at me
from the flat of your back.

1459
01:35:59.584 --> 01:36:01.211
Let the past die.

1460
01:36:02.212 --> 01:36:06.586
You've done well in my absence,
on the field and off, so I'm told.

1461
01:36:06.716 --> 01:36:10.262
Winning trophies, horses, women.

1462
01:36:11.471 --> 01:36:13.181
You put them in that order?

1463
01:36:13.890 --> 01:36:16.601
Generally, with a few exceptions.

1464
01:36:23.608 --> 01:36:25.235
Beautiful, isn't she?

1465
01:36:25.902 --> 01:36:29.114
A real thoroughbred trophy,
don't you think?

1466
01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.561
You speak of Jocelyn
like she's the target.

1467
01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.161
Isn't she?

1468
01:36:34.953 --> 01:36:36.121
No.

1469
01:36:40.208 --> 01:36:41.668
She is the arrow.

1470
01:36:45.797 --> 01:36:48.592
I've entered into negotiations
with her father.

1471
01:36:52.262 --> 01:36:54.097
I'm to make her my bride.

1472
01:36:55.265 --> 01:36:57.767
Oh she'll be saddled...

1473
01:36:58.351 --> 01:37:00.604
and placed on my mantle.

1474
01:37:01.605 --> 01:37:03.990
Target or arrow,
it makes no difference.

1475
01:37:04.608 --> 01:37:06.318
I will have her.

1476
01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:17.034
<i>Ulrich! Ulrich! Ulrich...!</i>

1477
01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:25.134
- Go!!
- Haahh!!

1478
01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.634
Hoooaahh!!

1479
01:37:51.196 --> 01:37:52.775
How would you beat him?

1480
01:37:52.996 --> 01:37:55.075
With a stick, while he slept.

1481
01:37:55.659 --> 01:37:58.370
But on a horse?
With a lance? heh!

1482
01:37:59.162 --> 01:38:01.540
That man is unbeatable.

1483
01:38:29.981 --> 01:38:31.069
Hello there!

1484
01:38:34.197 --> 01:38:37.593
You... you're Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein!

1485
01:38:37.697 --> 01:38:38.493
Yes.

1486
01:38:38.952 --> 01:38:44.031
You're my favorite knight.
When we joust, I always say I'm you.

1487
01:38:44.499 --> 01:38:48.828
What are you doing here in Cheapside?
There's no parade today.

1488
01:38:52.716 --> 01:38:54.342
Can you keep a secret?

1489
01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:12.070
I was born in Cheapside,

1490
01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.070
just around the corner there.

1491
01:39:14.404 --> 01:39:15.724
Truly, Sir Ulrich?

1492
01:39:15.994 --> 01:39:17.324
Truly.

1493
01:39:17.616 --> 01:39:19.951
I only live just there.

1494
01:39:21.661 --> 01:39:23.038
Uh how old are you?

1495
01:39:23.288 --> 01:39:24.458
Nine and one half.

1496
01:39:24.788 --> 01:39:26.458
Nine and one half.

1497
01:39:27.125 --> 01:39:29.113
I wonder if you remember a man,

1498
01:39:29.225 --> 01:39:31.213
though he may have died
before you were born...

1499
01:39:31.421 --> 01:39:33.091
He was as tall as a knight.

1500
01:39:33.421 --> 01:39:35.091
His name was John Thatcher.

1501
01:39:35.425 --> 01:39:37.053
Of course I remember him.

1502
01:39:37.125 --> 01:39:38.153
You do?

1503
01:39:38.261 --> 01:39:40.430
Well yeah, he lives there still.

1504
01:39:45.101 --> 01:39:49.105
Sometimes we see him sitting
at the window, but no one knows why.

1505
01:39:52.943 --> 01:39:54.027
What do you mean?

1506
01:40:42.284 --> 01:40:43.869
Is someone there?

1507
01:40:48.665 --> 01:40:51.303
If you're here for the net,
I haven't finished yet.

1508
01:40:51.565 --> 01:40:53.003
Come back tomorrow.

1509
01:40:57.299 --> 01:40:58.300
Who are you?

1510
01:41:01.344 --> 01:41:02.470
A knight.

1511
01:41:05.432 --> 01:41:08.560
My name... is Ulrich.

1512
01:41:09.811 --> 01:41:14.282
Ulrich? I hear that name
being chanted from the stadium.

1513
01:41:14.441 --> 01:41:16.318
What business have you here?

1514
01:41:16.818 --> 01:41:19.487
I have word, Master Thatcher.

1515
01:41:22.232 --> 01:41:23.474
Word of your son.

1516
01:41:24.326 --> 01:41:26.170
Of my William?!

1517
01:41:26.326 --> 01:41:27.870
Well, come in, sir!

1518
01:41:33.376 --> 01:41:34.813
What word?

1519
01:41:35.876 --> 01:41:36.913
Does he live?

1520
01:41:39.090 --> 01:41:40.800
Aye. He lives.

1521
01:41:42.844 --> 01:41:44.513
He is very well.

1522
01:41:46.181 --> 01:41:48.058
He wanted you to know...

1523
01:41:49.893 --> 01:41:52.270
that he changed his stars
after all.

1524
01:42:02.197 --> 01:42:04.574
And has he followed his feet?

1525
01:42:08.203 --> 01:42:10.831
Has he found his way home at last?

1526
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:13.291
Yes.

1527
01:42:21.424 --> 01:42:22.551
Father!

1528
01:42:22.884 --> 01:42:26.120
Oh, William! Oh, my boy!

1529
01:42:36.648 --> 01:42:40.026
I do like to meet this Wat.
And Roland as well.

1530
01:42:40.235 --> 01:42:42.837
You will, Father. You will.

1531
01:42:45.282 --> 01:42:46.577
And what of women?

1532
01:42:47.282 --> 01:42:49.577
Is there a certain one or many?

1533
01:42:50.912 --> 01:42:52.622
There is a certain one.

1534
01:42:54.457 --> 01:42:56.418
I should like to meet her as well.

1535
01:43:02.924 --> 01:43:05.260
Oh, but this leak won't do, father,

1536
01:43:05.844 --> 01:43:07.799
not in the chamber of a Thatcher.

1537
01:43:08.444 --> 01:43:10.699
For a blind Thatcher
it's quite fitting.

1538
01:43:12.934 --> 01:43:14.811
And a Thatcher I am.

1539
01:43:16.479 --> 01:43:17.972
I'll fix it for you.

1540
01:44:02.275 --> 01:44:04.162
<i>Alive. Can you imagine?</i>

1541
01:44:04.275 --> 01:44:06.762
And I thought he was dead, which is mad
because he was always so strong,

1542
01:44:06.812 --> 01:44:09.165
very strong. I remember...

1543
01:44:09.533 --> 01:44:11.493
Geoff, Jocelyn!

1544
01:44:11.827 --> 01:44:14.287
This day just gets better and better.

1545
01:44:17.249 --> 01:44:18.716
Somebody die?

1546
01:44:21.670 --> 01:44:23.672
Sir Ulrich von Lichtenstein.

1547
01:44:24.670 --> 01:44:25.672
What?

1548
01:44:27.384 --> 01:44:28.677
Adhemar...

1549
01:44:29.678 --> 01:44:31.581
followed you last night.

1550
01:44:31.978 --> 01:44:33.581
To Cheapside.

1551
01:44:33.932 --> 01:44:35.867
He says he saw your father.

1552
01:44:36.518 --> 01:44:39.571
Will, they asked me for your patents.

1553
01:44:43.859 --> 01:44:46.153
They're waiting
for you in the lists,

1554
01:44:46.259 --> 01:44:47.553
they're going to arrest you.

1555
01:44:48.029 --> 01:44:49.698
A dozen royal guards.

1556
01:44:50.866 --> 01:44:52.671
They'll put you in the stocks.

1557
01:44:53.766 --> 01:44:56.671
Ah, but I face Adhemar
in five minutes time.

1558
01:44:57.372 --> 01:44:59.109
No, you forfeit.

1559
01:44:59.472 --> 01:45:01.209
They've already marked it down.

1560
01:45:02.377 --> 01:45:03.814
<i>Saddle the horses,</i>

1561
01:45:04.277 --> 01:45:05.797
they can arrest your baggage,
not you.

1562
01:45:11.887 --> 01:45:13.430
Halt.

1563
01:45:18.727 --> 01:45:20.437
So, what do you think...

1564
01:45:22.939 --> 01:45:24.858
now that you know what I am?

1565
01:45:26.234 --> 01:45:28.205
Ah, to know what you are, William,

1566
01:45:28.984 --> 01:45:30.405
would take a lifetime.

1567
01:45:31.072 --> 01:45:34.309
One I am most willing to give.
But right now you've got to run.

1568
01:45:35.744 --> 01:45:38.379
There is nothing else to do.
Run, and I will run with you.

1569
01:45:38.413 --> 01:45:40.415
Jocelyn, I cannot run.

1570
01:45:40.749 --> 01:45:44.352
I'm a knight, and I'll
put myself to the hazard!

1571
01:45:44.628 --> 01:45:49.123
A knight in your heart, but not on paper,
and paper's all that matters to them!

1572
01:45:51.593 --> 01:45:53.720
William, I love you.

1573
01:45:55.764 --> 01:45:58.441
I love you. You.

1574
01:46:00.602 --> 01:46:03.490
And I'm sorry, but I won't see you
led away bound for the stocks

1575
01:46:03.692 --> 01:46:05.590
Oh, but you'll see me run? No!

1576
01:46:06.441 --> 01:46:08.443
Damn your pride, William.

1577
01:46:08.944 --> 01:46:11.780
It is you and only you that
will not see you run,

1578
01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:14.482
My pride is the only
thing they can't take from me!

1579
01:46:14.533 --> 01:46:18.278
But they can take it from you.
They can and they will.

1580
01:46:18.829 --> 01:46:20.330
Oh, they will.

1581
01:46:21.122 --> 01:46:23.458
But love they cannot take.

1582
01:46:28.797 --> 01:46:29.832
And...

1583
01:46:30.297 --> 01:46:31.832
And where will we live?

1584
01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:34.402
In... in my hovel?

1585
01:46:35.512 --> 01:46:38.351
With the pigs inside in winter, so
that they won't freeze?

1586
01:46:41.059 --> 01:46:42.394
With the pigs.

1587
01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:47.148
The poor can marry for love.

1588
01:46:48.984 --> 01:46:52.420
Oh Jocelyn, you speak of what
you do not know!

1589
01:46:55.699 --> 01:46:57.701
William, I beg you.

1590
01:46:58.493 --> 01:46:59.828
Please.

1591
01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:04.482
Run. Do it for love.

1592
01:47:12.132 --> 01:47:13.842
Roland, you would see me run?

1593
01:47:20.849 --> 01:47:22.017
And you, Geoff?

1594
01:47:22.851 --> 01:47:25.729
Yes, I wish it too, with all
the pieces of my heart.

1595
01:47:32.027 --> 01:47:35.697
Wat, you and I,
we aren't runners.

1596
01:47:39.868 --> 01:47:41.636
Yes...

1597
01:47:43.038 --> 01:47:44.989
William, today we are.

1598
01:47:48.210 --> 01:47:49.586
Run, William.

1599
01:47:54.784 --> 01:47:55.728
No!!

1600
01:47:56.384 --> 01:47:58.428
I will not run!!

1601
01:48:05.727 --> 01:48:07.270
I am a knight.

1602
01:48:20.242 --> 01:48:21.576
Well, boys...

1603
01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:24.579
all good things must
come to an end.

1604
01:48:25.497 --> 01:48:27.415
Let's end them together.

1605
01:49:04.703 --> 01:49:08.331
You will remove yourself
from this position of honor.

1606
01:49:10.417 --> 01:49:11.751
I am here to compete.

1607
01:49:12.169 --> 01:49:14.546
You are here to be arrested.

1608
01:49:22.012 --> 01:49:23.346
Alright!

1609
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:54.377
He that strives to touch a star...

1610
01:49:55.253 --> 01:49:56.922
oft stumbles...

1611
01:49:57.255 --> 01:49:58.924
at a simple straw.

1612
01:50:09.893 --> 01:50:11.603
You have been weighed.

1613
01:50:19.236 --> 01:50:20.946
You have been measured.

1614
01:50:23.949 --> 01:50:25.659
And you have been found wanting.

1615
01:50:31.289 --> 01:50:33.251
It's one loss or another...

1616
01:50:33.889 --> 01:50:34.951
William.

1617
01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:44.494
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1618
01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.494
Uh!

1619
01:51:22.382 --> 01:51:23.842
Leave, Roland.

1620
01:51:24.926 --> 01:51:26.561
Let them have me.

1621
01:51:27.262 --> 01:51:29.097
God love you, William.

1622
01:51:29.472 --> 01:51:30.891
So do I.

1623
01:51:31.474 --> 01:51:34.143
Go! Disperse!!

1624
01:51:35.737 --> 01:51:37.564
Or I will fong you!

1625
01:51:38.148 --> 01:51:40.609
As Jesus Christ the Nazarene...

1626
01:51:40.809 --> 01:51:43.805
and His Most Holy Mother,
the Virgin Mary are my witnesses!

1627
01:51:43.959 --> 01:51:45.105
I will fong you!

1628
01:51:45.822 --> 01:51:48.533
I will rip you! Fist! Pain!

1629
01:51:48.909 --> 01:51:53.079
I'll stick my fist and break you!
Pain! Lots of pain!

1630
01:51:59.336 --> 01:52:00.754
We're in trouble.

1631
01:52:04.508 --> 01:52:06.176
Listen to me!

1632
01:52:06.758 --> 01:52:07.676
Uhh!

1633
01:52:10.847 --> 01:52:12.849
Listen to me!

1634
01:52:45.549 --> 01:52:47.926
What a pair we make, huh?

1635
01:52:51.429 --> 01:52:53.857
Both trying to hide who we are.

1636
01:52:54.891 --> 01:52:56.926
Both unable to do so.

1637
01:53:05.235 --> 01:53:07.070
Your men love you.

1638
01:53:09.239 --> 01:53:12.409
If I knew nothing else about you,
that would be enough.

1639
01:53:13.952 --> 01:53:16.347
But you also tilt,

1640
01:53:16.452 --> 01:53:18.347
when you should withdraw.

1641
01:53:20.250 --> 01:53:22.669
And that is knightly too.

1642
01:53:30.427 --> 01:53:31.936
Release him!

1643
01:53:41.605 --> 01:53:44.608
He may appear to be
of humble origins...

1644
01:53:45.859 --> 01:53:48.945
but my personal historians
have discovered...

1645
01:53:49.279 --> 01:53:53.208
that he is descendant
from an ancient royal line.

1646
01:53:56.286 --> 01:53:57.996
This is my word.

1647
01:53:59.456 --> 01:54:03.159
And as such, is beyond contestation.

1648
01:54:08.298 --> 01:54:09.257
Now...

1649
01:54:10.634 --> 01:54:13.970
if I may repay the kindness
you once showed me.

1650
01:54:15.305 --> 01:54:16.606
Take a knee.

1651
01:54:33.365 --> 01:54:37.369
By the power vested in me
by my father, King Edward...

1652
01:54:38.537 --> 01:54:40.997
and by all the witnesses here...

1653
01:54:44.167 --> 01:54:45.502
I dub thee...

1654
01:54:48.213 --> 01:54:49.506
Sir William.

1655
01:55:01.768 --> 01:55:03.354
Arise...

1656
01:55:03.768 --> 01:55:05.154
Sir William.

1657
01:55:11.736 --> 01:55:13.029
Can you joust?

1658
01:55:13.706 --> 01:55:14.589
What?

1659
01:55:14.698 --> 01:55:16.700
There's my tournament to finish?

1660
01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:19.605
Now, are you fit to compete, or

1661
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:21.805
shall the forfeit stand?

1662
01:55:22.539 --> 01:55:23.798
Oh, I'm fit.

1663
01:55:24.875 --> 01:55:27.596
I shall have your opponent
informed of it.

1664
01:55:27.975 --> 01:55:30.296
You look for his shield on the lists,

1665
01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:31.915
at once.

1666
01:55:32.382 --> 01:55:34.100
Thank you, my lord.

1667
01:55:44.269 --> 01:55:46.730
All hail Prince Edward!

1668
01:55:51.735 --> 01:55:54.070
My lords, my ladies...

1669
01:55:54.946 --> 01:55:57.407
and all you other people.

1670
01:55:58.241 --> 01:56:03.954
I give you the son of Philippe de Vitry,
son of Gilles de Champagne...

1671
01:56:05.582 --> 01:56:07.584
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1672
01:56:08.293 --> 01:56:11.496
It's nothing but spun sugar
and boot black.

1673
01:56:20.263 --> 01:56:21.848
It's a small target Wil...

1674
01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.268
but aim for his heart.

1675
01:56:31.441 --> 01:56:33.993
<i>...doer of daring deeds...</i>

1676
01:56:34.945 --> 01:56:38.323
conqueror of countless
kingdoms, Count...

1677
01:56:39.018 --> 01:56:42.017
Aaaaaaaa...

1678
01:56:42.118 --> 01:56:43.887
ADHEMAR!!

1679
01:58:14.488 --> 01:58:16.487
<i>Adhemar! Adhemar! Adhemar...!</i>

1680
01:58:28.934 --> 01:58:31.136
Oh, God.
I'll fetch the surgeon Will.

1681
01:58:31.228 --> 01:58:32.370
Roland!

1682
01:58:32.812 --> 01:58:34.522
You're the surgeon now.

1683
01:58:36.441 --> 01:58:37.567
Come on.

1684
01:58:41.441 --> 01:58:42.667
Uhhh!!

1685
01:58:45.325 --> 01:58:46.909
He's tipped it.

1686
01:58:49.246 --> 01:58:51.414
Kate, get me back to one.

1687
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:53.750
Back to one or we forfeit.

1688
01:59:00.924 --> 01:59:03.093
Dirty son of a bitch!

1689
02:00:13.330 --> 02:00:16.666
Kate, I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1690
02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:25.509
As I said, thatcher.

1691
02:00:27.719 --> 02:00:30.680
In what world could you
have ever beaten me?

1692
02:00:31.348 --> 02:00:33.308
Such a place does not exist.

1693
02:00:35.727 --> 02:00:37.237
She's here William!

1694
02:00:39.706 --> 02:00:41.190
And so is your father.

1695
02:00:45.195 --> 02:00:46.780
Change your stars.

1696
02:00:51.827 --> 02:00:53.620
Let's dance, you and I.

1697
02:00:57.374 --> 02:00:59.084
<i>It's two lances to none.</i>

1698
02:00:59.376 --> 02:01:03.046
You must unhorse him or kill him.
It's the only way to win.

1699
02:01:13.056 --> 02:01:15.934
- You need more padding.
- No, leave it off.

1700
02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:18.228
I can't breathe with it on.

1701
02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:25.026
Lance.

1702
02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.726
Ahhh, No!

1703
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:31.992
God! I can barely grip it!

1704
02:01:32.242 --> 02:01:33.577
Oh damn.

1705
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:41.585
Lash it to my arm.

1706
02:01:45.755 --> 02:01:46.965
Wat...

1707
02:01:47.674 --> 02:01:49.517
Lash it to me arm.

1708
02:01:52.387 --> 02:01:54.030
Do as he says.

1709
02:02:11.698 --> 02:02:13.241
Good people!

1710
02:02:14.284 --> 02:02:15.619
I missed my introduction!

1711
02:02:26.796 --> 02:02:28.465
But please...

1712
02:02:28.798 --> 02:02:30.467
please, I pray you.

1713
02:02:30.967 --> 02:02:32.469
Hear it now.

1714
02:02:33.845 --> 02:02:35.805
For I would lay rest...

1715
02:02:36.139 --> 02:02:38.475
the grace in my tongue...

1716
02:02:38.808 --> 02:02:40.477
and speak plain.

1717
02:02:41.645 --> 02:02:43.480
Days like these...

1718
02:02:43.913 --> 02:02:47.484
are far too rare to cheapen
with heavy-handed words.

1719
02:02:48.919 --> 02:02:53.097
And so, I'm afraid,
without any ado whatsoever...

1720
02:02:53.323 --> 02:02:54.699
Excuse me, my lord.

1721
02:02:55.158 --> 02:02:56.695
Here he is!

1722
02:02:57.108 --> 02:02:58.795
One of your own!

1723
02:02:58.996 --> 02:03:02.415
Born a stone's throw from
this very stadium...

1724
02:03:02.749 --> 02:03:04.584
and here before you now!

1725
02:03:04.918 --> 02:03:07.320
The son of John Thatcher...

1726
02:03:07.921 --> 02:03:10.394
Sir wiiilllLLIAM

1727
02:03:10.491 --> 02:03:11.924
THATCHER!!!

1728
02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:23.803
That's your name Wil.

1729
02:03:26.064 --> 02:03:28.166
Sir William Thatcher.

1730
02:03:28.859 --> 02:03:30.977
Your father heard that.

1731
02:03:31.159 --> 02:03:46.977
<i>William! William! William...!</i>

1732
02:03:48.378 --> 02:03:50.088
Godspeed, William.

1733
02:04:42.777 --> 02:04:43.988
HYAAHHH!!

1734
02:05:02.077 --> 02:05:08.788
WILLIAAAAAAAAAM!!!

1735
02:05:25.809 --> 02:05:27.811
You have been weighed.

1736
02:05:29.271 --> 02:05:30.480
You have been measured.

1737
02:05:33.650 --> 02:05:35.819
And you absolutely...

1738
02:05:36.486 --> 02:05:38.155
Have been found wanting.

1739
02:05:42.325 --> 02:05:44.161
Welcome to the new world.

1740
02:05:44.703 --> 02:05:48.206
God save you, if it is right
that he should do so.

1741
02:05:54.796 --> 02:06:00.923
<i>WILLIAAAAAAAAAM!!!</i>

1742
02:06:11.062 --> 02:06:12.731
Yeesss!!! Ye...

1743
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:15.734
He's won! He's won!

1744
02:06:50.810 --> 02:06:52.479
You beat him, Will!

1745
02:06:57.150 --> 02:06:58.568
Oh, William.

1746
02:07:19.172 --> 02:07:21.174
I think I'll have to write
some of this story down.

1747
02:07:21.466 --> 02:07:23.568
Like that part about the prince?
And the knights?

1748
02:07:23.718 --> 02:07:25.582
No no no, all of it.

1749
02:07:25.718 --> 02:07:28.682
All human activity lies
within the artist's scope.

1750
02:07:31.184 --> 02:07:33.019
