00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:21.453
Viv, I know there are only three
shopping days left, but they called,

2
00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:23.455
And they want to see
your house in an hour.

3
00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.624
(rock music playing)
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.626
Mom! Make Buzz turn off the music.
(pop music playing)

5
00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.695
No problem.
Mom!

6
00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:32.064
- "Mom."
- Hang on, Viv.

7
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.766
Let your sister rehearse.
Like that'll help.

8
00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.035
And clean up the kitchen.
<i>But...</i>

9
00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:38.637
Now. Okay, Viv.
I'll see you in a bit.

10
00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.706
I thought I told you
to clean up the kitchen.

11
00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:43.542
I did. Can I go to the movies
tonight with some friends? No.

12
00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:47.279
No... No, no. I'm showing a house
and I need you to baby-sit Kevin.

13
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:49.281
Well, why can't Megan do it?

14
00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:51.282
Because she has to go
to rehearsal at the teen center.

15
00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.283
And you don't<i> have</i> to go to the movies.
I do if I want a life.

16
00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:57.256
You're baby-sitting Kevin.
Hey, where is he, anyway? Kevin.

17
00:00:57.258 --> 00:00:59.691
<i>What is it? What is it?</i>
BOY:<i> A car!</i>

18
00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.827
<i>Whoa!</i> MAN: <i>Wait a second.
That was...</i>

19
00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.329
<i>Honey, that was mine.</i>

20
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.765
BUZZ (on tv): <i>Awesome. It's got
an antenna and everything.</i>

21
00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:09.468
DAD: <i>Merry Christmas, Mommy.</i>
BOY:<i> Merry Christmas.</i>

22
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.104
MOM (on tv):
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

23
00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:14.239
DAD: <i>What did I get?</i>
BUZZ:<i> What is this?</i>

24
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.542
Megan: <i>Thank you.</i> MOM: <i>Everybody get in the shot.</i>

25
00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:19.445
<i>Everybody get together.</i>
BUZZ: <i>Okay.</i>

26
00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:22.181
MOM (on tv): <i>All right. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.</i>

27
00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:25.084
<i>Merry Christmas.
Very funny, Buzz.</i>

28
00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:27.086
<i>(Mom laughing on TV)</i>

29
00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:30.222
- Last Christmas, huh?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.193
This Christmas isn't
gonna be any fun.

31
00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:38.464
Of course it will.

32
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:42.201
Honey, we're gonna do all the
same things we've always done.

33
00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:45.704
Sing Christmas carols,
be with family and friends,

34
00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:49.575
Put cookies and milk
out for Santa.

35
00:01:49.577 --> 00:01:52.811
- It's gonna be just the same.
- Except this year,

36
00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:55.247
no Dad.

37
00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.484
Right. That's the one thing
that's different.

38
00:01:58.486 --> 00:02:00.686
Why can't you just
get back together?

39
00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:04.556
(sighs) Honey, we're just gonna
have to let that go.

40
00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:08.227
<i>(chattering on TV)</i>
That's a no, right?

41
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.797
It means some things are
just out of our control.

42
00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.166
I know you miss your dad.

43
00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:17.736
And he loves me very much.

44
00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:21.140
You both do, and it has
nothing to do with me.

45
00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:24.910
- Did he tell you that?
- I'm nine years old. I watch a lot of tv.

46
00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:29.248
Did he leave because of me?

47
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.416
No. Of course not.

48
00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:35.654
I knew it. It was Buzz and Megan.
(chuckles)

49
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:39.625
Oh, it wasn't anyone...
Or any one thing.

50
00:02:39.627 --> 00:02:42.561
Then what was it?

51
00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:46.498
That's not easy to explain.

52
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.701
But, uh, sometimes when...

53
00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:53.505
people are married for a long time,
they get into kind of a rut.

54
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:57.476
You know what a rut is? Yeah. Like,
when people aren't having any fun,

55
00:02:57.478 --> 00:02:59.411
and they're really bored.

56
00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:01.847
Kind of like that.

57
00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.650
Now, will you come downstairs?

58
00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:06.652
When you're ready.

59
00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.355
<i>(chattering on TV)</i>

60
00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:15.928
<i>Hey!
(clapping)</i>

61
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.864
<i>Wait a second.</i>

62
00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:22.668
Megan: Kevin, come in here. BUZZ:
Yeah, hurry, you've gotta see this!

63
00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:30.209
(groans)
Ow! Hey! Hey!

64
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:32.778
- You always fall for that.
- Let me up, zit-face!

65
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.614
- Lamebrain. When are you gonna learn?
- Get off your brother.

66
00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:38.517
- And shouldn't you be rehearsing?
- (Kevin grunting)

67
00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.787
- How are you getting to the teen center?
- Ashley's mom's picking me up in a half hour.

68
00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.256
(grunting continues) Can I
please go to the movies?

69
00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:46.291
No. I told you.
You're watching Kevin.

70
00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:48.694
- Please let him go. I'll stay home alone.
- No.

71
00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:52.831
- (scoffs) I've done it before.
- Don't remind me.

72
00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:55.934
You loused up my whole night.

73
00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.370
If I'm gonna be miserable,
you're gonna be miserable.

74
00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:00.372
Mom!
(door opens)

75
00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:02.874
MAN: Hello. It's me. Dad!

76
00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:04.910
Dad!
Hey, big guy.

77
00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.613
(growls playfully) I didn't
know you were coming tonight.

78
00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:09.581
Oh, I thought I'd surprise you.
Hey, Dad.

79
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:12.484
Hey, Buzz.

80
00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:15.754
Oh, Kate. Gosh,
the place looks great.

81
00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:18.690
Really nice decorations.

82
00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:20.826
- Same as every year.
- KEVIN: So, um,

83
00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:22.628
Dad, why'd you come tonight?

84
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.297
Actually, I want to talk to
your mom about something.

85
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.036
Privately.

86
00:04:31.038 --> 00:04:33.972
Do you think he wants to come home?
Aw, Kev.

87
00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.975
(huffs)

88
00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:39.711
What?
No "Hello, how are ya?"

89
00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:42.748
I'm sorry. I have a business
appointment, Peter. What do you want?

90
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.751
Okay, gosh. I wasn't gonna
jump right into it, but...

91
00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:50.489
Well, you know Natalie and I
are living together, and, uh,

92
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:53.992
well, when our divorce is final,
I'm gonna marry her.

93
00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:57.596
Really?

94
00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:02.434
You're getting married again.

95
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:11.076
Wow. That's, uh...
That...

96
00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:13.812
(exhales) Wow. We've only been
separated eight months.

97
00:05:13.814 --> 00:05:18.617
Yeah, I... it just happened real
quickly, and... listen, Kate,

98
00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:22.054
I really want the kids to spend a
little time with me over the holidays.

99
00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:24.656
You want the kids for Christmas?

100
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.926
Just a couple of days. I want them
to get to know Natalie better.

101
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.565
Oh, because she's gonna be
their, uh, stepmother.

102
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:35.567
Yeah.

103
00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:42.341
Well, you're gonna
have to ask them.

104
00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:46.011
I know.

105
00:05:46.013 --> 00:05:48.880
- How am I supposed to see my friends?
- It's only for a few days.

106
00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:52.551
Well, duh, but that's just long enough
for me to fall out of the loop.

107
00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:56.822
- Yeah, you can't expect us to give up our vacation.
- Well, Kevin?

108
00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:59.391
There's a royal family
coming to visit.

109
00:05:59.393 --> 00:06:03.395
They have a son around your age. You might
have a chance to play with a crown prince.

110
00:06:03.397 --> 00:06:06.031
A crown prince?
Wouldn't that be cool?

111
00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:09.501
- Yeah, way cool.
- And you guys wouldn't believe the room

112
00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:12.070
that Natalie has set up for you.

113
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.072
What do you say?

114
00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:22.481
- I think I'm gonna pass.
- (exhales)

115
00:06:22.483 --> 00:06:25.984
It just wouldn't be right leaving
the family at Christmas.

116
00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:28.787
I'm sure you understand.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

117
00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:33.792
Well, it's... it's
an open invitation, hmm?

118
00:06:36.397 --> 00:06:38.697
And I won't be back too late.

119
00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.867
And since you're staying home, it
wouldn't hurt to do some of your chores.

120
00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:45.437
Yes, ma'am.
I'll make sure they get done.

121
00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.916
Clean it, cheese-face.

122
00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:12.964
Ow!

123
00:07:18.672 --> 00:07:21.206
Oops.

124
00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:23.508
My fault.

125
00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:32.784
Hello, I'm home.

126
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.087
Hey.

127
00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.757
How'd it go?
Awful.

128
00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.060
I hate Buzz and I never want to be stuck
home alone with him as long as I live.

129
00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:45.564
Oh, honey.
I know he picks on you.

130
00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:48.600
Picks on me? Humiliates
me, tortures me.

131
00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:50.769
I'm sick of being everyone's
favorite joke around here.

132
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:54.072
Yeah. Yeah,
it's hard to be the youngest.

133
00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:58.009
Well, I hate Buzz. I wish I didn't
have a brother or a sister.

134
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:00.712
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do!

135
00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:03.048
I wish I was an only child!

136
00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:11.590
Well, I'm sorry that
you're so unhappy.

137
00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:15.660
Maybe you should go to your room and think about
what you have, rather than what you don't have.

138
00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:19.231
(scoffs)

139
00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:23.201
(sighs)

140
00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:26.171
Only children don't know
how good they have it.

141
00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:29.975
Life would be perfect if
Buzz and Megan weren't around.

142
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.716
I mean, is it too much to ask for
a family who actually likes me?

143
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:42.020
(sighs)
I'd run away.

144
00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:44.823
If I knew where to run to.

145
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:49.995
Hey, I do!

146
00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:52.230
I have an open invitation.

147
00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:56.601
(coins jingling)

148
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:02.140
PETER: Can't get my
seat belt unfastened.

149
00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:04.242
(woman laughs)

150
00:09:11.652 --> 00:09:13.885
PETER:
Thanks, Alan.

151
00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:17.889
Thanks.

152
00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:21.259
Oh, what an incredible evening.

153
00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:23.562
And not a bad night's work.

154
00:09:23.564 --> 00:09:26.164
We raised over two million
for those children's charities.

155
00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:28.867
Door, open.

156
00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:38.276
And I am on the verge of signing two
of the biggest clients in Chicago.

157
00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:41.713
That's because you're the
best publicist in the world.

158
00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:45.984
- Doors, close.
- Have I remembered to thank you for telling everyone that?

159
00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:47.953
Fire, light.
Not tonight you haven't.

160
00:09:47.955 --> 00:09:49.921
Perhaps I ought to
show my appreciation.

161
00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:52.123
Music, on.
(classical music starts)

162
00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:54.826
Curtains, close.
(chuckles)

163
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.836
Aw, nuts. Just when
things were getting good.

164
00:10:04.838 --> 00:10:07.272
Nice house, huh, pumpkin?

165
00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:10.275
Sure is, Marv. You sure
you don't wanna rob it?

166
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:12.777
No. No, I don't wanna rob it.

167
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:17.148
My robbery days are over. Darling, we're
moving up to the big money. All right?

168
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.351
The easy money.
No middleman.

169
00:10:19.353 --> 00:10:22.821
Pure profit. Strictly
a class operation, huh?

170
00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:25.790
Three words, Vera.
Kid... na... pping.

171
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:29.961
I think that's only one word.

172
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.030
We're gonna wait for
the royals to arrive...

173
00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:35.767
Hup, dup, dodey-do... and then
we're gonna kidnap the prince.

174
00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:38.670
(high-pitched voice) "Oh, don't kidnap me.
I'm fancy."

175
00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:40.672
You sure we can pull it off?

176
00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:42.774
I mean, without
Harry making the plans?

177
00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:46.678
Look where Harry's plans kept
landing me, huh? In jail.

178
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.847
Well, not this time.
Because this time...

179
00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:50.915
I'm the boss.

180
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:52.917
- (scoffs)
- Who's the boss?

181
00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:56.087
- You're the boss.
- I love being married. Eh?

182
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.399
- That's my girl.
- Hey!

183
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:10.435
Oh! Looks like
they got a visitor.

184
00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:35.226
This where you want to go?

185
00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:38.963
Yeah, this is the place. Thank
you very much. (coins jingling)

186
00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:41.066
Keep the change.

187
00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:43.134
It's<i> all</i> change.

188
00:11:57.818 --> 00:12:00.385
(snoring)

189
00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:05.290
(beep)

190
00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:08.760
(sighs)

191
00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:21.840
Who are you?

192
00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:25.510
(gulps)

193
00:12:25.512 --> 00:12:27.979
MAN (on speaker):
<i>Beg your pardon, ma'am.</i>

194
00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:30.014
Yes, Prescott?

195
00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:33.985
Mr. McCallister has a visitor. The
young man claims to be his son.

196
00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:36.254
Well, send him in.

197
00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.826
- Kevin!
- Dad!

198
00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:45.330
Hey! Oh! I thought
you said weren't coming.

199
00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:49.267
Well, I started thinking, hey, it's not fair
if Mom gets all the kids for Christmas.

200
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.369
(chuckling) What's Christmas
without kids, right?

201
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.072
Right. Hello, Kevin.

202
00:12:54.074 --> 00:12:56.541
Hi, Natalie. I hope you don't mind
me just dropping in like this,

203
00:12:56.543 --> 00:12:58.777
But my dad did invite me.

204
00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:01.813
- Yes, I know.
- So is the invitation still open?

205
00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:06.084
Of course it is. Molly, would
you come here, please?

206
00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:10.955
I've been looking forward
to spending time with you.

207
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.224
Your dad talks about
you kids a lot.

208
00:13:13.226 --> 00:13:15.426
Buzz is the troublemaker.
I'm the adorable one.

209
00:13:15.428 --> 00:13:18.429
Oh. Ah, Molly.

210
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:22.000
This is Kevin McCallister, and he's going
to be staying with us for a few days.

211
00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:23.968
Would you make up
the special guest room?

212
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.571
Ah, the special guest room.

213
00:13:26.573 --> 00:13:28.106
Right away, ma'am.

214
00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:35.480
- Oh, and Prescott, give Kevin a house key.
- If you say so, ma' am.

215
00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:42.887
What kind of key is this?

216
00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:44.956
It's a key to the whole house.

217
00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.026
This is a smart house, Kevin. It
does whatever you tell it to.

218
00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:50.195
Fire, out.

219
00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:55.500
Curtains, open.

220
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.439
Wow! I think
I'm gonna like it here.

221
00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:05.977
Go ahead. You try.

222
00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:10.281
Door, open.

223
00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.595
Wow! This stuff
is so cool.

224
00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:26.598
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

225
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.234
This is such cool stuff! Ah!

226
00:14:29.236 --> 00:14:32.503
Oh! Look at this game!

227
00:14:32.505 --> 00:14:35.573
This chair's
a remote control chair! Oh!

228
00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.976
Oh, yeah!

229
00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:40.445
This is so cool! Oh!

230
00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:43.014
- Think you'll be comfortable here?
- I'll say!

231
00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:46.551
Thanks, Natalie. This is gonna
be the best Christmas ever!

232
00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.887
Lights out, Kev.

233
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.891
Hey, Kevin?

234
00:14:52.893 --> 00:14:55.526
Kevin.

235
00:14:55.528 --> 00:14:57.595
How many times
can I lose this child?

236
00:14:57.597 --> 00:15:00.198
Kevin.
(cell phone rings)

237
00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:04.102
Hello.
PETER: Kate, I...

238
00:15:04.104 --> 00:15:06.271
wanted to let you know
Kevin just got here.

239
00:15:06.273 --> 00:15:08.907
Oh, thank God...

240
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:13.044
He got there... safely.

241
00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:15.613
- I was gonna call you, but uh...
- Are you okay?

242
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.218
Yeah. Yes, I'm fine.

243
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.187
Well, thanks for
letting him come.

244
00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:28.226
- Well, thanks for calling.
- Merry Christmas.

245
00:15:33.633 --> 00:15:35.934
Merry Christmas.

246
00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:51.416
MOLLY'S VOICE:
<i>Good mornin', Kevin.</i>

247
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.484
Good morning.

248
00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:57.121
Who's there?
<i>Over here, dear.</i>

249
00:15:57.123 --> 00:16:00.658
Hey. Hi.

250
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.361
<i>Breakfast time.
Anything special you'd like?</i>

251
00:16:03.363 --> 00:16:05.129
Anything?

252
00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.231
<i>Anything.</i>

253
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.693
- Wow!
- Sometimes I can't wait for Santa to come,

254
00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:38.997
so I end up doing
some shopping by myself.

255
00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:41.332
Would you like to open one?
No, you're gonna spoil him.

256
00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:45.470
Dad, it's her house. If she wants
to spoil me, she can spoil me.

257
00:16:45.472 --> 00:16:48.439
All right. All right.
But just one.

258
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:50.441
And not...
The biggest one.

259
00:16:53.113 --> 00:16:55.146
Does it really fly?

260
00:16:55.148 --> 00:16:57.415
It really does,
but only outside.

261
00:16:57.417 --> 00:17:00.184
NATALIE: We don't want to break anything.
Wow! Thanks, Natalie!

262
00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:07.458
Why do you have to leave?
It's so close to Christmas.

263
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.462
Yeah, I know, but the royal family's
coming for one of Natalie's fund-raisers,

264
00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:16.134
and it's my job to make sure the event's
well-covered by press and photographers.

265
00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:21.439
Hey, it's not gonna take that long, and I won't
have to work for the rest of your vacation, okay?

266
00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:24.575
And if you need anything, ask Prescott.
He'll take care of you.

267
00:17:24.577 --> 00:17:27.211
It's a cool plane, huh?

268
00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:29.047
I think she's trying
to buy my affection.

269
00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.516
- (chuckles) Kevin.
- What?

270
00:17:31.518 --> 00:17:34.152
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

271
00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:37.221
I'm glad you're here.

272
00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:41.426
(engine starts)

273
00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:06.250
Mr. Prescott,
can I ask you a question?

274
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:11.389
- Yes.
- Can you make a milk shake?

275
00:18:16.863 --> 00:18:19.097
Do you have chocolate?

276
00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.566
What? Natalie said
anything I need.

277
00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:24.869
And you need a milk shake, do you?
A chocolate one.

278
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:28.139
- Do you think we'll have a white Christmas?
- It seems highly unlikely,

279
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:30.374
given the recent
unseasonable temperatures.

280
00:18:30.376 --> 00:18:33.211
What's this thing?
A mini elevator?

281
00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:36.614
It's called a dumbwaiter.

282
00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.784
- Why is it called a waiter?
- Because it carries food.

283
00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:42.153
- Why is it called dumb?
- Because it doesn't speak...

284
00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:44.155
or ask countless
idiotic questions.

285
00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.693
(machine whirring)

286
00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:21.926
- Can you read?
- (gasps)

287
00:19:21.928 --> 00:19:24.929
The door.
"No entry."

288
00:19:24.931 --> 00:19:27.932
- What, does that mean me?
- Especially you.

289
00:19:35.408 --> 00:19:39.210
This is the control center from which
I manage this entire household...

290
00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:41.279
as well as my personal quarters.

291
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:43.748
Now, Miss Natalie may have
granted you run of her home,

292
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.385
but this is my domain
and strictly off-limits.

293
00:19:47.387 --> 00:19:49.453
Understood?

294
00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:52.356
Any more questions?

295
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:54.458
Good.

296
00:19:59.432 --> 00:20:03.401
(humming)

297
00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:08.339
Hey, Molly.
Whatcha doing?

298
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:10.408
Cleanin' the house.

299
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.878
- Gross.
- Oh, no, no. Not in this house.

300
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.515
Watch. Vacuum, on.

301
00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:26.891
- Vacuum, off.
- Wow! The place even cleans itself!

302
00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:29.327
Want to see somethin'
really cool?

303
00:20:31.698 --> 00:20:33.731
Open sesame.

304
00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:40.004
Wow! This place is awesome.

305
00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:42.940
(chuckles)
Yes, it is.

306
00:20:42.942 --> 00:20:45.576
¶ Wow, I feel good ¶
(lip-synching)

307
00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:50.481
¶ I knew that I would now ¶

308
00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:53.584
¶ I feel good ¶

309
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:56.654
¶ I knew that I would now ¶

310
00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:00.524
¶ So good so good ¶

311
00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:03.261
¶ I got you ¶

312
00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.596
¶ Ow I feel nice ¶

313
00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:10.768
¶ Like sugar and spice ¶

314
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.804
¶ I feel nice ¶

315
00:21:13.806 --> 00:21:16.007
¶ Like sugar and spice ¶

316
00:21:17.677 --> 00:21:20.678
¶ So nice so nice ¶

317
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.947
¶ I got you ¶

318
00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:28.019
(thud)
(Prescott groans)

319
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.458
¶ When I hold you in my arms ¶

320
00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.828
¶ I know that I can do no wrong¶

321
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.365
¶ And when I hold you
in my arms ¶

322
00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:43.668
¶ My love won't do you no harm ¶

323
00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.671
¶ And I feel nice ¶

324
00:21:46.673 --> 00:21:48.939
¶ Like sugar and spice ¶
Music, off?

325
00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.344
¶ I feel nice ¶

326
00:21:53.346 --> 00:21:55.546
¶ Like sugar and spice ¶
Music, off.

327
00:21:55.548 --> 00:21:57.615
I'm off to the store.
I'll be back in an hour or so.

328
00:21:57.617 --> 00:21:59.550
And don't pick on
that dear child.

329
00:22:00.987 --> 00:22:03.421
Door, open.

330
00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:12.830
MARV:
She's out of the house.

331
00:22:16.869 --> 00:22:18.869
All right.
The coast is clear.

332
00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:22.406
Let's go. Wait. Are
you sure it's safe?

333
00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:24.809
Pumpkin, would I take you
in there if it wasn't safe?

334
00:22:24.811 --> 00:22:29.847
It's just if the prince don't arrive till
tomorrow, why are we going in there now?

335
00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:32.583
To get the lay of the land.
What do ya think, Vera,

336
00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:35.786
We're just gonna go in there
tomorrow and start grabbing kids?

337
00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:39.557
"Ooh, everybody
get in the van." No.

338
00:22:39.559 --> 00:22:44.061
We gotta figure out the where, the
when, the how to get him out of there.

339
00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:46.397
Do you know the secret
to criminal success?

340
00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:48.566
Not getting caught.

341
00:22:48.568 --> 00:22:51.535
Planning. Preparation.
Preparedness.

342
00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:53.537
Be prepared.
Be a prepared "preperator."

343
00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:56.507
Eh? That's my motto,
and that's why I'm...

344
00:22:56.509 --> 00:22:59.543
A boy scout.
No. The boss, eh?

345
00:22:59.545 --> 00:23:01.946
Who's the boss?
You're the boss!

346
00:23:01.948 --> 00:23:03.948
Where's the boss?
Right here.

347
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.917
Hey. Boss, party of one.
Right there.

348
00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:09.520
All right.
Let's go, pookie.

349
00:23:21.834 --> 00:23:24.835
No. It can't be!

350
00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:33.477
It is! It's Marv!

351
00:23:36.082 --> 00:23:38.716
Mr. Prescott?
Mr. Prescott, are you there?

352
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.791
Mr. Prescott! Help!

353
00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:59.570
(gasps)
Marv, the alarm is on.

354
00:23:59.572 --> 00:24:02.606
Oh, no.
What are we gonna do?

355
00:24:03.443 --> 00:24:05.609
Watch this, eh?

356
00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:09.513
Oh.

357
00:24:10.983 --> 00:24:13.651
- Alarm, off.
- (beeps)

358
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:17.621
Hmm.
Door, open.

359
00:24:17.623 --> 00:24:19.757
(buzz)

360
00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:22.827
Ahh!
That is one handy gadget.

361
00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:25.129
Well, what's my motto?

362
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:27.865
You're the boss?

363
00:24:27.867 --> 00:24:30.634
Be prepared. Yeah. Right.

364
00:24:31.838 --> 00:24:33.871
I married a genius.

365
00:24:38.945 --> 00:24:41.846
What do you think that is?
Is that a turkey ball?

366
00:24:41.848 --> 00:24:44.548
Just put that down. Like a klepto here.
All right.

367
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:48.052
- The prince should be staying in one of these rooms.
- I think that's an elevator.

368
00:24:48.054 --> 00:24:50.855
Don't... you give me such a headache.
You give me a headache.

369
00:24:50.857 --> 00:24:53.891
You're giving me a headache.
You give me a headache.

370
00:24:53.893 --> 00:24:57.561
- MARV: Don't push me.
- Door, close.

371
00:24:57.563 --> 00:25:00.097
(whispering) You're driving me crazy.
You're driving me crazy.

372
00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:02.700
You're driving me...
Oh, shut up.

373
00:25:02.702 --> 00:25:05.703
Door, open.

374
00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.204
Door, close.
I love this thing.

375
00:25:07.206 --> 00:25:09.874
Marv...

376
00:25:09.876 --> 00:25:12.610
The door was... shutting.

377
00:25:12.612 --> 00:25:14.912
What's wrong with this thing?
Door, open.

378
00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:25.656
MARV (whispering):
I think there's somebody here.

379
00:25:25.658 --> 00:25:27.691
Anybody in here?

380
00:25:27.693 --> 00:25:29.727
Well, not now. Shh! You shh!

381
00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:32.096
You shh!
You shh!

382
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.300
(water running)

383
00:25:36.302 --> 00:25:38.736
Maybe the prince came early.

384
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.240
(water running)

385
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:04.094
(raspberry) MARV: What the...

386
00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:07.131
(both screaming)

387
00:26:11.304 --> 00:26:13.337
(groans)

388
00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:16.073
That's it. Come on.

389
00:26:20.713 --> 00:26:22.313
(groans)
Ow!

390
00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:28.352
(groaning)

391
00:26:28.354 --> 00:26:30.921
(screaming)

392
00:26:37.663 --> 00:26:40.331
(water rushing)

393
00:26:56.682 --> 00:26:58.682
(gasping)
Up!

394
00:27:02.755 --> 00:27:05.823
- MARV: Come on, honey.
- Uh! Marv!

395
00:27:07.193 --> 00:27:10.127
- (creaking)
- (Vera gasping)

396
00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:12.796
(screaming)

397
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.967
MARV:
Ow! Ow! Ow!

398
00:27:18.638 --> 00:27:22.740
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

399
00:27:22.742 --> 00:27:25.809
(Vera gasping)

400
00:27:26.746 --> 00:27:28.746
Mr. Prescott!

401
00:27:28.748 --> 00:27:32.149
Mr. Prescott!

402
00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:41.325
- You!
- Hello, Marv.

403
00:27:41.327 --> 00:27:44.828
Well, long time, no see.

404
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.730
- Huh, kid?
- Is that the prince?

405
00:27:46.732 --> 00:27:49.833
No, that's Kevin. Kevin, Vera.
Vera, Kevin.

406
00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:52.136
If that ain't him, let's get outta
here before somebody sees us.

407
00:27:52.138 --> 00:27:55.105
Yeah. I think we got
the lay of the land.

408
00:27:55.107 --> 00:27:58.308
I'll be back!
(yells)

409
00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:01.078
Come on!
Oh, all right!

410
00:28:03.382 --> 00:28:06.183
(tires squealing)

411
00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:31.308
House, clean yourself up.
(buzzes)

412
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.744
Well, it was worth a try.

413
00:28:33.746 --> 00:28:36.280
Okay, maybe
they won't be too mad.

414
00:28:36.282 --> 00:28:40.484
I mean, once I tell them what happened,
maybe they'll be okay with it.

415
00:28:42.988 --> 00:28:45.856
(screams)

416
00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:48.492
Or maybe not.
What... what...

417
00:28:48.494 --> 00:28:52.129
What... what...

418
00:28:52.131 --> 00:28:54.331
(creaking)
What... what...

419
00:28:56.302 --> 00:28:59.169
Okay, I know
it looks bad, but...

420
00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:01.472
(screams)
Honey, what's the...

421
00:29:01.474 --> 00:29:06.844
(panting) Kevin, what...
what... What have you done?

422
00:29:06.846 --> 00:29:09.379
Prescott! Prescott!

423
00:29:09.381 --> 00:29:12.049
It's not working. I tried.
Prescott: <i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

424
00:29:12.051 --> 00:29:15.753
Get up here! Now!

425
00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:19.456
- Well, it wasn't working.
- Kevin, what happened?

426
00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:22.159
It wasn't me.
It was the burglars.

427
00:29:22.161 --> 00:29:25.963
- The burglars?
- Yeah. And I recognized the one guy. Marv.

428
00:29:25.965 --> 00:29:28.398
Did I ever tell you about him?
Well, that's another story.

429
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.769
But the point is they were
gonna rip off your house.

430
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:35.139
- So you chose instead to trash it?
- No. I was trying to protect it.

431
00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:37.841
- By trashing it?
- What in the name of...

432
00:29:37.843 --> 00:29:39.843
Hey, why didn't you come
when I was calling you?

433
00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:41.812
Prescott,

434
00:29:41.814 --> 00:29:45.149
Were you aware of
any burglars here today?

435
00:29:45.151 --> 00:29:47.885
Burglars?

436
00:29:47.887 --> 00:29:51.155
No, ma'am. All the alarms
were on as usual.

437
00:29:51.157 --> 00:29:53.957
Maybe they turned 'em off.
They had one of these, you know.

438
00:29:53.959 --> 00:29:57.127
I saw no intruders, and except
for... beg your pardon, ma'am...

439
00:29:57.129 --> 00:30:01.365
The briefest of bathroom breaks, my
eyes were on the monitors at all times.

440
00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:05.269
How one child could do so much
damage in the time it took me to...

441
00:30:05.271 --> 00:30:07.471
- Well, it's quite beyond me.
- It wasn't me!

442
00:30:07.473 --> 00:30:09.473
Well, there was
no one else here.

443
00:30:09.475 --> 00:30:10.908
- He's lying!
- Am not!

444
00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.142
- Are too!
- Am not!

445
00:30:12.144 --> 00:30:14.878
- Are too!
- With all due respect, sir,

446
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.548
I did see master Kevin
playing with the devices...

447
00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.017
as if the house were a big toy.
(gasps)

448
00:30:20.019 --> 00:30:22.486
The only hooligan
here today was your son.

449
00:30:22.488 --> 00:30:25.856
(hyperventilating)
Give us a minute.

450
00:30:25.858 --> 00:30:28.559
(hyperventilating continues)

451
00:30:28.561 --> 00:30:31.295
Kevin.

452
00:30:31.297 --> 00:30:33.597
(hyperventilating continues)

453
00:30:41.073 --> 00:30:43.173
Kevin, sit.
Dad...

454
00:30:45.344 --> 00:30:49.112
What's going on? I told you. The
burglars broke into the house.

455
00:30:49.114 --> 00:30:53.016
Kevin, you know I can forgive
just about anything but lying.

456
00:30:53.018 --> 00:30:56.386
Oh, right. So you wouldn't get mad if
I wrecked the place, which I didn't,

457
00:30:56.388 --> 00:30:58.388
as long as I admit that I did,

458
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.490
which I didn't?

459
00:31:01.527 --> 00:31:05.629
Well, I thought
this over and, uh,

460
00:31:05.631 --> 00:31:08.298
I understand that this is a
difficult adjustment for you.

461
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.635
And it's only natural that you'd be
acting out. It's a need for attention.

462
00:31:11.637 --> 00:31:13.370
- No, it isn't.
- Kevin!

463
00:31:13.372 --> 00:31:17.307
Anyway...

464
00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:20.510
Anyway, what's a little damage?

465
00:31:20.512 --> 00:31:23.881
It's not as if I'm not insured.

466
00:31:23.883 --> 00:31:25.916
Do you have something to say?

467
00:31:25.918 --> 00:31:29.119
Thank you.

468
00:31:29.121 --> 00:31:33.423
- And?
- I'm sorry for the damage of your house.

469
00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:14.031
(audio rewinding)

470
00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:17.167
The security cameras must have
got the whole thing on tape.

471
00:32:20.673 --> 00:32:23.140
What?

472
00:32:23.142 --> 00:32:25.542
Prescott must have
turned off the cameras.

473
00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:32.182
MARV:
It's unbelievable.

474
00:32:32.184 --> 00:32:34.618
It is not to be believed!

475
00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:38.388
I can't believe this!

476
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.457
It's the lousy kid again.

477
00:32:40.459 --> 00:32:43.460
Everywhere I break into!

478
00:32:43.462 --> 00:32:46.029
It's like he's stalking me
or something.

479
00:32:46.031 --> 00:32:47.631
Come on, Marv.
He's just a little boy.

480
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:50.701
Yeah, well, I got
big scars from that little...

481
00:32:52.204 --> 00:32:54.037
Never mind.

482
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.606
I'll tell you one thing,

483
00:32:56.608 --> 00:32:59.576
this time he's
not gonna mess me up.

484
00:32:59.578 --> 00:33:04.348
- Mm-hmm.
- This time it's all gonna go smooth as silk.

485
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:07.484
Because this time...

486
00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:09.686
I got an inside man.

487
00:33:09.688 --> 00:33:11.989
- (chuckling)
- (chuckling)

488
00:33:13.025 --> 00:33:15.192
Oh.
(chuckles)

489
00:33:19.598 --> 00:33:21.665
(grunts)
(tires squeal)

490
00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:24.134
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

491
00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:27.237
(horn honking) MARV: Hey, come on!
Watch the road! Safety first.

492
00:33:55.501 --> 00:33:58.668
- (screams)
- What are you doing here?

493
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:03.340
- Tell me.
- I, uh... I...

494
00:34:04.543 --> 00:34:06.676
Nothing. I swear.

495
00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:09.613
I just thought all of this was kinda
cool so I wanted to take a look at it.

496
00:34:09.615 --> 00:34:14.351
You don't go to other people's homes
uninvited, and you don't touch their things.

497
00:34:14.353 --> 00:34:17.554
Didn't I warn you what would happen
if I ever caught you in here again?

498
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:19.623
Not specifically.

499
00:34:21.427 --> 00:34:24.294
Trust me.
It won't be pleasant.

500
00:34:24.296 --> 00:34:27.064
(knocking on door)
What do you want?

501
00:34:27.066 --> 00:34:29.533
I thought I heard
the boy. Ah!

502
00:34:29.535 --> 00:34:32.135
And indeed I did.

503
00:34:32.137 --> 00:34:35.439
I don't want him bothering you anymore,
so I'll just get him out of your way.

504
00:34:35.441 --> 00:34:37.507
Come along, Kevin.

505
00:34:40.512 --> 00:34:43.413
He'll be my responsibility
from now on.

506
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.423
Thank you for saving me, Molly.

507
00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:56.827
Prescott is a good person
to stay away from.

508
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:59.463
You're telling me.
He's one of the bad guys...

509
00:34:59.465 --> 00:35:03.017
The bad guys who
broke into the house.

510
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:06.570
Although technically they didn't break
in, because they had their own remote.

511
00:35:06.572 --> 00:35:09.706
And who do you think gave them that?
Prescott?

512
00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:13.110
- Mm-hmm.
- That sounds a bit far-fetched to me.

513
00:35:13.112 --> 00:35:16.546
I know. And you probably think I
have an overactive imagination.

514
00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:19.783
Most people do.
But you have to believe me.

515
00:35:19.785 --> 00:35:23.820
Kevin, Prescott is a lonely man.
The only thing he has is this job.

516
00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:26.356
And between you and me,
he hates working here.

517
00:35:26.358 --> 00:35:29.693
But to do what you're suggesting...
Then it all makes perfect sense.

518
00:35:29.695 --> 00:35:33.497
He hates his job, so he tries to pull off
a big heist so he can afford to quit.

519
00:35:33.499 --> 00:35:35.832
Ah, I don't know.
Listen.

520
00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:38.268
He told my dad I was lying
when I wasn't.

521
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.339
And he shut off the security cameras.
So it can only mean one thing.

522
00:35:42.341 --> 00:35:45.375
- And that is?
- Marv and his new friend...

523
00:35:45.377 --> 00:35:47.444
have an inside guy...

524
00:35:47.446 --> 00:35:51.148
Prescott.
I think you're right.

525
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:55.485
- I am?
- Yeah. You do have an overactive imagination.

526
00:35:57.456 --> 00:36:00.290
But that's what I love
about children.

527
00:36:00.292 --> 00:36:04.594
My own son was the same as you
at your age... a real handful.

528
00:36:04.596 --> 00:36:06.663
You must have been
a great mom, Molly.

529
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.370
Well, you just try to keep that
imagination under control, okay?

530
00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:18.475
<i>(classical music on stereo)</i>

531
00:36:18.477 --> 00:36:21.511
PETER: You were very understanding
about what happened today.

532
00:36:21.513 --> 00:36:25.348
Well, Kevin's going through
a difficult time.

533
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.350
It's not easy
when your parents split up.

534
00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:29.452
Believe me, I know.

535
00:36:29.454 --> 00:36:31.354
But we'll get through it.

536
00:36:31.356 --> 00:36:33.857
You're gonna be a great stepmom.

537
00:36:33.859 --> 00:36:36.560
<i>(music continues)</i>

538
00:36:36.562 --> 00:36:40.897
(exhales) I think we just need to figure out
a way to make him feel more at home here.

539
00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:44.568
Maybe do some of the Christmas things he's
used to doing, like trimming the tree.

540
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.672
You do that yourself? (chuckles)
Yes, I do that myself.

541
00:36:48.674 --> 00:36:52.309
It's fun. That's exactly what we're
gonna do. We're gonna trim the tree.

542
00:36:52.311 --> 00:36:54.911
It'll get us in the spirit
of things, unite us as a family.

543
00:36:55.714 --> 00:36:57.814
Okay.
Okay?

544
00:36:57.816 --> 00:37:03.587
No friends, no fun, no snow.

545
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:06.890
This is definitely gonna be
the worst Christmas ever.

546
00:37:09.228 --> 00:37:11.494
Hey, Kev.
How you doing?

547
00:37:18.303 --> 00:37:20.670
(sighs)

548
00:37:20.672 --> 00:37:23.540
What do you say we just forget
about today and start over, huh?

549
00:37:23.542 --> 00:37:26.476
You mean it?
Yeah.

550
00:37:26.478 --> 00:37:27.944
You know, Natalie's really
a great person.

551
00:37:27.946 --> 00:37:31.014
You just gotta get to
know her better.

552
00:37:31.016 --> 00:37:33.817
I think we should start having
a little more fun around here.

553
00:37:33.819 --> 00:37:36.419
I could live with that.
Yeah?

554
00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:38.288
Why don't we start
by trimming that tree?

555
00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:39.723
Now?
Sure. Why not?

What did you say?

583
00:39:03.709 --> 00:39:05.942
Of course we'll be there.
We wouldn't miss it.

584
00:39:05.944 --> 00:39:09.546
Let me call you back.
(phone beeps off)

585
00:39:09.548 --> 00:39:12.916
Evangelista's in town. Margaret's just
throwing together a little impromptu supper,

586
00:39:12.918 --> 00:39:15.552
but we shouldn't go, should we?

587
00:39:15.554 --> 00:39:19.356
Well, why don't you just go ahead without me,
and Kevin and I will finish up over here?

588
00:39:19.358 --> 00:39:21.391
Really? You wouldn't mind?

589
00:39:21.393 --> 00:39:24.394
No. They're your friends anyway.

590
00:39:24.396 --> 00:39:27.497
You're an angel.
I won't be home late.

591
00:39:30.135 --> 00:39:32.869
Okay.

592
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:34.804
Where were we?

593
00:39:34.806 --> 00:39:39.709
You don't have to stay because of me.
No, I want to stay. Really.

594
00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:42.145
So, does Natalie go out
every night?

595
00:39:42.147 --> 00:39:46.916
Pretty much. She leads a very exciting
life... more exciting than we're used to.

596
00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:48.952
So you'd say
you're not in a rut?

597
00:39:48.954 --> 00:39:52.689
No, I'm not in a rut. Why?

598
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:54.657
I thought maybe
that's why you left.

599
00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:57.494
Kevin. Kevin, you know...

600
00:39:59.064 --> 00:40:02.665
I didn't leave your mom
to be with Natalie, okay?

601
00:40:02.667 --> 00:40:04.601
That just kind of
happened later.

602
00:40:04.603 --> 00:40:05.935
You wanna tell me about it?

603
00:40:07.873 --> 00:40:12.142
(exhales) Adult relationships
are just complicated.

604
00:40:12.144 --> 00:40:15.712
Sometimes when two people get married
really young like your mom and I did,

605
00:40:15.714 --> 00:40:17.580
You just end up
feeling kind of...

606
00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:20.450
- You missed out on some things.
- Yeah.

607
00:40:20.452 --> 00:40:22.452
Just 'cause you grow up
on the outside,

608
00:40:22.454 --> 00:40:24.454
doesn't mean you wanna stop
having fun, enjoying life.

609
00:40:24.456 --> 00:40:26.656
I know all about
the inner child, Dad.

610
00:40:26.658 --> 00:40:30.460
- Oh. You do, huh?
- That's why old guys drive sports cars.

611
00:40:30.462 --> 00:40:32.562
You're probably right.

612
00:40:32.564 --> 00:40:36.766
But the trouble with sports
cars... no room for anybody else.

613
00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:40.770
Maybe one other person max. But if
you want to take a real road trip,

614
00:40:40.772 --> 00:40:43.640
with luggage and all, you don't
even have room for a friend.

615
00:40:43.642 --> 00:40:46.142
I mean, they're
cool and fast and all,

616
00:40:46.144 --> 00:40:49.779
but who wants to be in a nice
car when you're all alone?

617
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:05.962
(Kate sighs)

618
00:41:05.964 --> 00:41:09.632
Well, that looks
just about perfect.

619
00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:12.502
All that's left to do now
is put on the star.

620
00:41:12.504 --> 00:41:14.637
Kevin always puts on the star.

621
00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:16.639
That's right.
He does, doesn't he?

622
00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:19.242
I always hold him up.
And then I give him a wedgie.

623
00:41:19.244 --> 00:41:24.214
(chuckles) He makes a fuss.
We all laugh.

624
00:41:24.216 --> 00:41:27.550
Well, I guess we're just gonna
have to use the ladder this year.

625
00:41:29.888 --> 00:41:32.755
Okay, Dad, you can
put me down now.

626
00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:36.826
Wow. Looks pretty good.

627
00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:39.028
I think it looks great.

628
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:41.564
I think it's our best tree yet.

00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:46.269

Mornin'.

638
00:42:24.643 --> 00:42:27.243
Good morning, sleepyheads.
You're finally up.

639
00:42:27.245 --> 00:42:29.245
What did you do to our tree?

640
00:42:29.247 --> 00:42:31.231
Oh, that's my fault.

641
00:42:31.232 --> 00:42:33.216
I have a standing appointment with
the tree decorators every year.

642
00:42:33.218 --> 00:42:36.619
And in all the excitement,
I forgot to cancel.

643
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:38.655
Are you ever gonna forgive me?

644
00:42:38.657 --> 00:42:41.090
You undid our tree?

645
00:42:41.092 --> 00:42:44.827
Well, it would have had to
come down eventually anyway.

646
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:47.564
Yeah, come on, Kev.
Look at all these presents, huh?

647
00:42:47.566 --> 00:42:50.333
Oh, wait. Ooh, here's a big one.
I believe it has...

648
00:42:50.335 --> 00:42:52.635
Yes, it has your name on it.

649
00:42:52.637 --> 00:42:55.572
Come on. Let's open it up.
It's from Natalie and me.

650
00:42:55.574 --> 00:42:58.241
But shouldn't I open it
tomorrow on Christmas?

651
00:42:58.243 --> 00:43:01.744
Ah, you got plenty to open tomorrow.
Come on. One won't hurt.

652
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:04.247
Go ahead.

653
00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:07.016
(gasps) Super spy bugging
and listening device.

654
00:43:07.018 --> 00:43:11.921
Isn't that cool? Yeah. Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Natalie.

655
00:43:11.923 --> 00:43:14.724
I'm glad you like it.

656
00:43:20.332 --> 00:43:23.666
- Hey, Mom, where are you going?
- I'm going to take Kevin some things.

657
00:43:23.668 --> 00:43:26.736
- Mom, where you going?
- He doesn't have any clean clothes with him,

658
00:43:26.738 --> 00:43:28.171
and I'm sure he doesn't
have any toys to play with.

659
00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:34.210
To check out Dad's girlfriend.
Wanna go?

660
00:43:35.747 --> 00:43:37.880
(doorbell rings)

661
00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:43.052
May I help you?

662
00:43:43.054 --> 00:43:45.088
Wow! I'm here for
Kevin McCallister.

663
00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:47.390
Wow!
Buzz.

664
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.691
- Are you here to take him home?
- No, I have something for him.

665
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.262
Right this way.

666
00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:54.998
PETER:
You should be able to hear that.

667
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.834
How do I sound? KATE (on
headset): <i>Kids, stay close.</i>

668
00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.270
Mom!
Hey!

669
00:44:01.272 --> 00:44:03.940
Hey!

670
00:44:03.942 --> 00:44:07.310
Mmm! Ohh!

671
00:44:07.312 --> 00:44:10.246
- (chuckles) - Hey, you guys
remember Natalie, right?

672
00:44:10.248 --> 00:44:11.981
Buzz, Megan.
Hi, Natalie.

673
00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:15.718
Oh, and, uh,
Kate, this is Natalie.

674
00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.121
Natalie, Kate.
Hello, Kate.

675
00:44:18.123 --> 00:44:20.323
Hello.

676
00:44:20.325 --> 00:44:23.259
So, are you guys gonna stay?

677
00:44:23.261 --> 00:44:27.730
No, I just brought you some of your stuff.
You guys gotta see this house.

678
00:44:27.732 --> 00:44:31.100
- Is that okay, Natalie?
- Of course. Be my guest.

679
00:44:32.704 --> 00:44:35.371
Awesome tree!
It used to look better.

680
00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:37.807
Wait, what is this thing
on your head?

681
00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:40.242
It's a spy kit that Natalie got me
for an early Christmas present.

682
00:44:40.245 --> 00:44:43.012
Really?
That was nice of you.

683
00:44:43.014 --> 00:44:45.314
Well, I'm very fond
of your kids.

684
00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:47.817
I've gotta show you
this airplane that she got me.

685
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.357
Would you like a cup of coffee?

686
00:44:54.359 --> 00:44:56.759
Oh, no, thank you.

687
00:44:56.761 --> 00:45:01.297
I, uh, didn't know he would have
all this stuff to play with. Yeah.

688
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.233
Oh, god. Hey.
Let me get that.

689
00:45:04.235 --> 00:45:06.769
I wasn't even sure he could
even sleep without it.

690
00:45:06.771 --> 00:45:08.171
Gosh, you know what?

691
00:45:08.173 --> 00:45:09.939
I cannot believe
he hasn't even asked for it.

692
00:45:09.941 --> 00:45:12.208
Well, we could buy him
another stuffed animal.

693
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.077
Oh, no, no.
No.

694
00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:16.045
This is, uh, is Teddy.

695
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.247
Teddy is his
transitional object.

696
00:45:18.249 --> 00:45:21.417
Yeah.
Transitional object.

697
00:45:21.419 --> 00:45:25.788
It's like something very, very special
a child carries with him everywhere.

698
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.925
You're actually supposed to have a
spare, in case something happens to it.

699
00:45:28.927 --> 00:45:32.795
Of course, we only had one, remember?
Oh! How could I forget?

700
00:45:32.797 --> 00:45:34.997
We were driving down
the highway,

701
00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:37.433
like, really in a hurry,
going somewhere,

702
00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.868
of course, Kevin thinks, oh possibly
Teddy might want a little fresh air.

703
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:42.472
So he rolls down the window
and out flies Teddy!

704
00:45:42.474 --> 00:45:45.508
He was ballistic. He was crying.
He was so upset.

705
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.944
It was... oh, my...

706
00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:50.379
So Peter pulls over, and I get
out to retrieve the bear.

707
00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:53.049
- I still can't believe you did that.
- (chuckles)

708
00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:55.985
Well, it was the slow lane,
and there wasn't much traffic.

709
00:45:55.987 --> 00:45:59.322
Yeah, well, I don't know what he
would have done if he had lost it.

710
00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:07.063
Well, I think Kevin's going to have so
much fun playing with the prince...

711
00:46:07.065 --> 00:46:09.198
that he's not even gonna
miss the stuffed animal.

712
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.236
It's going to be so wonderful having a house
full of children. I'm looking forward to it.

713
00:46:13.238 --> 00:46:16.139
Children, watch
the garden sculpture!

714
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:20.009
Well, I... better get going.

715
00:46:25.517 --> 00:46:28.084
Before they break something.

716
00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:36.459
Well, we're off to the airport
to pick up the royal family.

717
00:46:36.461 --> 00:46:39.028
You all know
how important this is.

718
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.130
Now, the caterers
will be here momentarily.

719
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:43.399
And the guests will arrive
about an hour before...

720
00:46:43.401 --> 00:46:46.869
you and the royals make your grand
entrance. MOLLY: No need to worry, ma'am.

721
00:46:46.871 --> 00:46:49.372
Everything will be
taken care of.

722
00:46:49.374 --> 00:46:53.242
It's just that I want everything to
go right. Come on. Let's not be late.

723
00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:56.979
I don't want one single thing to go wrong.
Door, open.

724
00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:59.816
And nothing will.

725
00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:06.189
(people chattering)

726
00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:32.982
(knocking on door)

727
00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:40.523
Prescott: Oh, good.
You've finally arrived.

728
00:47:54.939 --> 00:47:58.374
- Mr. Prescott! Mr. Prescott! It's them!
- Hush, you.

729
00:47:58.376 --> 00:48:00.509
I'll get him out of your way.
Thank you.

730
00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:04.080
It's the burglars! It's the burglars!
Aah! Mr. Prescott!

731
00:48:04.082 --> 00:48:06.649
KEVIN (yelling):
it's Marv!

732
00:48:06.651 --> 00:48:09.018
I guess you already
knew that though.

733
00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:13.923
Listen, you. I have just about had
enough of you and your melodrama!

734
00:48:13.925 --> 00:48:17.960
This is a very important night, and if I have
to lock you up to keep you out of our way,

735
00:48:17.962 --> 00:48:20.062
don't think I won't do it.
Look!

736
00:48:20.665 --> 00:48:23.266
Ow!

737
00:48:23.268 --> 00:48:26.636
Ow! Ow!

738
00:48:26.638 --> 00:48:30.106
Don't trifle with me,
you demon spawn!

739
00:48:32.543 --> 00:48:37.013
Now that's a foolish place to hide.
(groans)

740
00:48:47.959 --> 00:48:51.193
One down, two to go.

741
00:48:51.195 --> 00:48:53.529
(muffled) Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

742
00:48:53.531 --> 00:48:55.698
It's freezing cold!
Let me out!

743
00:49:11.182 --> 00:49:14.317
Kevin, have you seen Prescott?

744
00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:16.485
Not lately.
Ah, typical.

745
00:49:16.487 --> 00:49:18.521
Always poking around
when you don't want him,

746
00:49:18.523 --> 00:49:21.590
and when you need him... nowhere
to be found. (doorbell rings)

747
00:49:21.592 --> 00:49:26.195
Ah! Guests already? Whatever
happened to fashionably late?

748
00:49:29.367 --> 00:49:31.968
NATALIE: Well, I don't
like to boast, but,

749
00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:35.638
yes, it will be the party
of the season. (beep)

750
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.241
Oh, I'm getting another call.
All right. See you there.

751
00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:44.013
Hello? Carmelina, how are you?
(mouthing words)

752
00:49:45.283 --> 00:49:47.683
What? Oh, no!

753
00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:51.487
They're snowed in.
Their flight's been canceled.

754
00:49:51.489 --> 00:49:54.156
Well, so am I. Devastated.

755
00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:56.993
Well, all right.
We'll see you tomorrow.

756
00:49:56.995 --> 00:49:58.728
Merry Christmas.

757
00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.430
(phone beeps off)

758
00:50:01.432 --> 00:50:05.001
What are we gonna do now? It's
gonna be just an ordinary party.

759
00:50:05.003 --> 00:50:09.739
Christmas Eve at your place sounds
anything but ordinary to me.

760
00:50:09.741 --> 00:50:12.041
It's hardly the party
of the season.

761
00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:16.579
Peter.

762
00:50:16.581 --> 00:50:21.217
- What if we announce our engagement tonight?
- Tonight?

763
00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:24.020
I know we were gonna wait till
after your divorce was final,

764
00:50:24.022 --> 00:50:27.256
but it's only a few weeks away
and your kids already know,

765
00:50:27.258 --> 00:50:29.625
and it'll make tonight
so special.

766
00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:31.694
Well, if it makes you happy.

767
00:50:31.696 --> 00:50:34.063
Yes!

768
00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:37.566
(chuckles)

769
00:50:40.071 --> 00:50:42.138
Where are those guys?

770
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.308
Marv, I gotta tinkle. Vera,
you can tinkle next week.

771
00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.310
MARV (on headset):
<i>Always in a hurry.</i>

772
00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:50.713
Door, open.

773
00:50:55.286 --> 00:50:57.486
All right.
Now, you remember the plan?

774
00:50:57.488 --> 00:51:00.489
Which plan? Harry's plan? What... no!
Not harry's plan!

775
00:51:00.491 --> 00:51:03.359
The one involving rope and a bag!
Why are you yelling at me?

776
00:51:03.361 --> 00:51:05.261
I'm not yell...

777
00:51:05.263 --> 00:51:07.696
Do you remember the plan? Yeah.

778
00:51:07.698 --> 00:51:10.833
Now, when the prince comes
up to bed... We bag him!

779
00:51:10.835 --> 00:51:15.571
- That's right. We kidnap the kid napping.
- You're a genius, Marv.

780
00:51:15.573 --> 00:51:19.141
That's right.
Door, open.

781
00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:22.311
Now, the prince goes in the bag.

782
00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:26.215
The bag goes out the window.
Uh-huh.

783
00:51:26.217 --> 00:51:29.185
We climb down the rope.
<i>Door, close.</i>

784
00:51:29.187 --> 00:51:30.519
Right.

785
00:51:30.521 --> 00:51:33.589
MARV (on headset):
<i>Everybody in the van.</i>

786
00:51:36.094 --> 00:51:38.828
And we're gone before
they know what hit 'em.

787
00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:43.132
Beautiful plan, Marv.
Elegant in its simplicity.

788
00:51:43.134 --> 00:51:47.303
All right. Let's try it out.
Get in the bag.

789
00:51:47.305 --> 00:51:49.271
Me? Why don't you
get in the bag?

790
00:51:49.273 --> 00:51:51.607
Because I'm the boss.
Get in the bag, Vera.

791
00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:54.677
- I don't wanna get in the bag.
- Vera, just get in the bag! Please!

792
00:51:54.679 --> 00:51:57.279
You didn't tell me
I was gonna get in no bag.

793
00:51:57.281 --> 00:51:59.882
I was saving it. It's gonna be fun.
Ooh, we're in the bag!

794
00:51:59.884 --> 00:52:02.118
- (grunting)
- (groaning)

795
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.687
Nice. All right.

796
00:52:04.689 --> 00:52:07.723
Window, open.

797
00:52:07.725 --> 00:52:09.792
Ahh.
(grunts)

798
00:52:12.897 --> 00:52:15.631
VERA:
Uh, Marv. Ooh. Oh.

799
00:52:15.633 --> 00:52:19.335
(grunts) Don't worry, honey.
I got ya.

800
00:52:19.337 --> 00:52:21.770
Marv! Let me down easy.

801
00:52:21.772 --> 00:52:25.374
I always do, baby.
(straining)

802
00:52:25.376 --> 00:52:27.576
Shouldn't have had
that last piece of cake.

803
00:52:27.578 --> 00:52:30.312
(yelps)

804
00:52:30.314 --> 00:52:32.681
(rope creaking)

805
00:52:34.452 --> 00:52:37.286
- Perfect.
- Door, open.

806
00:52:39.223 --> 00:52:40.723
(screams)

807
00:52:42.827 --> 00:52:45.628
- (groans)
- Don't worry.

808
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.663
Everything's under control.

809
00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:49.765
Uh, uh, Marv...

810
00:52:51.169 --> 00:52:53.402
(screaming)

811
00:52:53.404 --> 00:52:55.337
- (thud)
- Easy...

812
00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:57.840
but still way cool.

813
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.913
(Marv groaning)

814
00:53:05.683 --> 00:53:08.284
Thanks for breaking
my fall, pumpkin.

815
00:53:08.286 --> 00:53:10.753
(hoarse voice)
I always do, baby. Okay.

816
00:53:10.755 --> 00:53:12.821
Get out and stay out!

817
00:53:19.263 --> 00:53:22.831
- I know what you're trying to do.
- Oh, yeah, wise guy? What?

818
00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:26.402
You're trying to
kidnap the prince.

819
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.474
Shut up, ya little moron!

820
00:53:34.412 --> 00:53:36.912
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Okay.

821
00:53:36.914 --> 00:53:39.215
(chuckling)

822
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:46.255
(raspberry)

823
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.962
Vera, honey.
Little help?

824
00:53:52.964 --> 00:53:55.831
Oh, yeah, baby. That'd be great.
I sure could use it.

825
00:54:03.574 --> 00:54:06.642
- <i>(Marv groaning on headset)</i>
- I got every word.

826
00:54:07.678 --> 00:54:09.612
(imitates cheer)

827
00:54:09.614 --> 00:54:12.448
<i>(classical music on stereo)</i>

828
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.684
Welcome back. Where's the royal family?
They were snowed in.

829
00:54:15.686 --> 00:54:17.519
Ah!
Where's Prescott?

830
00:54:17.521 --> 00:54:20.656
I can't find him anywhere.
That's odd.

831
00:54:20.658 --> 00:54:24.560
Well, Molly, make sure
everyone has champagne.

832
00:54:24.562 --> 00:54:27.396
We're going to make a special
announcement. Yes, ma'am.

833
00:54:39.877 --> 00:54:43.345
How are you? Hi, how are you?
Good to see you again.

834
00:54:44.715 --> 00:54:46.682
Everyone, may I have
your attention?

835
00:54:46.684 --> 00:54:48.617
Huh?

836
00:54:50.321 --> 00:54:53.422
I am gonna kill that...

837
00:54:53.424 --> 00:54:55.724
Uuh!

838
00:55:07.772 --> 00:55:10.506
- (clattering)
- (screaming)

839
00:55:14.812 --> 00:55:18.814
This is always a special night, and
tonight may be even more special.

840
00:55:19.617 --> 00:55:21.016
(seething)
Get him!

841
00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:25.888
- Peter and I are engaged!
- (crowd exclaiming)

842
00:55:28.626 --> 00:55:31.527
(screams, shouts)

843
00:55:42.106 --> 00:55:45.074
- (teeth chattering)
- Prescott?

844
00:55:45.076 --> 00:55:48.577
- (softly moaning)
- This could not be goin' worse.

845
00:55:48.579 --> 00:55:51.480
Marv, you're on fire.

846
00:55:51.482 --> 00:55:53.716
Oh, thanks, baby.
You're not so bad yourself.

847
00:55:53.718 --> 00:55:56.719
No, sweetheart.
You're really on fire.

848
00:55:56.721 --> 00:55:59.788
Well, I try to work out.
You know... Aah!

849
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.124
<i>Gaah! Aah!</i>

850
00:56:02.126 --> 00:56:06.795
- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
- Kevin!

851
00:56:11.502 --> 00:56:14.703
I'm not lying.
The bad guys are back.

852
00:56:14.705 --> 00:56:16.705
We're not getting anywhere.

853
00:56:18.376 --> 00:56:22.411
Kevin, I spoke to
all the caterers and to Molly.

854
00:56:22.413 --> 00:56:26.949
Nobody saw a thing but you.
Now, how could that be?

855
00:56:26.951 --> 00:56:29.885
I don't know. But I heard they're
gonna kidnap the prince.

856
00:56:29.887 --> 00:56:34.123
- You heard them say that?
- Yeah, with my super spy bugging device.

857
00:56:34.125 --> 00:56:37.760
- And Prescott's involved with the whole thing.
- This is absurd.

858
00:56:37.762 --> 00:56:41.964
I'm going to call and make sure the royal
family's flight is okay for tomorrow.

859
00:56:44.068 --> 00:56:46.468
Kevin, I know
what's going on here.

860
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:48.871
You do?
Yeah.

861
00:56:48.873 --> 00:56:53.175
You're out to destroy my
relationship with Natalie. What?

862
00:56:53.177 --> 00:56:56.979
You knew how important tonight was to her, and
you went and pulled a crazy stunt like this.

863
00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:59.148
- That's not the truth.
- I've given you a lot of leeway,

864
00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:02.651
because I know how tough
this divorce has been on you.

865
00:57:02.653 --> 00:57:05.888
But tonight you went
way too far.

866
00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:08.524
I want you to go to your room and
think about what you've done.

867
00:57:11.529 --> 00:57:14.596
And when you're ready to apologize
to Natalie, then we'll talk.

868
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.937
Door, close.

869
00:57:34.752 --> 00:57:38.687
<i>Here you are, George! Merry Christmas!</i>
(woman crying)

870
00:57:41.759 --> 00:57:43.926
(ringing)

871
00:57:47.998 --> 00:57:50.966
- Hello?
- Mom?

872
00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:54.770
Kevin! Oh, Kevin.
I'm so glad you called.

873
00:57:54.772 --> 00:57:57.639
Are you okay?

874
00:57:57.641 --> 00:58:00.976
Yeah, yeah. I'm just watching
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

875
00:58:00.978 --> 00:58:04.580
- You are?
- You know how that gets to me.

876
00:58:04.582 --> 00:58:06.648
- What channel is it on?
- Eight.

877
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:15.757
Ohh.

878
00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:18.060
I guess I'm just a sucker
for happy endings.

879
00:58:20.564 --> 00:58:23.198
So, how is your party?
Are you havin' a good time?

880
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.536
Yeah, it's all right. How about you?
Havin' a good Christmas Eve?

881
00:58:31.909 --> 00:58:34.943
Yeah. It's great.

882
00:58:34.945 --> 00:58:37.513
(sniffles)

883
00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:41.083
- (sobs) I love you, Kevin.
- Love you too, Mom.

884
00:58:41.085 --> 00:58:43.752
(laughs)
Merry Christmas.

885
00:58:43.754 --> 00:58:47.523
- Merry Christmas.
- Okay. Bye.

886
00:58:48.559 --> 00:58:50.659
(beeps off)

887
00:58:52.563 --> 00:58:54.530
(beeps off)

888
00:58:54.532 --> 00:58:56.632
(crying)

889
00:59:01.272 --> 00:59:04.907
(knocking)

890
00:59:04.909 --> 00:59:07.976
- Kevin, are you awake?
- Yeah.

891
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:14.983
Your father and I were a little
rough on you before. Are you okay?

892
00:59:14.985 --> 00:59:18.120
- Yeah.
- Good.

893
00:59:18.122 --> 00:59:21.123
Because if you ever do anything like that
again, you'll be out of this house so fast...

894
00:59:21.125 --> 00:59:23.091
your head will spin.

895
00:59:23.093 --> 00:59:27.229
So your father's getting divorced. Boo-hoo.
Everyone's parents get divorced.

896
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:31.066
That's life. You'll get over it. But you're
not gonna come between your father and me.

897
00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:35.037
He wants you in his life,
and I think that's admirable.

898
00:59:35.039 --> 00:59:39.274
But if you want him in your
life, you better not cross me.

899
00:59:39.276 --> 00:59:44.146
Understood? Good.

900
00:59:47.718 --> 00:59:51.687
I'll have that window fixed first
thing in the morning. Sweet dreams.

901
00:59:56.093 --> 00:59:59.161
MAN (on tv): <i>To my big brother
George, the richest man in town.</i>

902
00:59:59.163 --> 01:00:02.264
<i>(crowd exclaiming)</i>

903
01:00:04.001 --> 01:00:07.235
I've just had
a nice little chat with Kevin.

904
01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:08.870
I think we're beginning to
understand each other better.

905
01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.990
What are you watching?

906
01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:14.041
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i> They've
been running it all night.

907
01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:16.278
- Come on. Watch it with me.
- I've seen it.

908
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.681
- So?
- So...

909
01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:23.085
I don't understand people who
watch movies over and over again.

910
01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:25.954
I saw it. I cried.
Once was enough.

911
01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:29.191
You gotta be kidding. Kate and I
watch this every year with the kids.

912
01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:31.360
It's a family tradition.

913
01:00:31.362 --> 01:00:34.162
Well.
(clicks off)

914
01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:38.867
Now that you're going to have a new family,
maybe it's time for some new traditions.

915
01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:51.279
They'll be back.
And if no one believes me,

916
01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:54.116
I'll have to catch 'em myself.
(grunts)

917
01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:17.773
MARV:
<i>Shut up, you little moron.</i>

918
01:01:17.775 --> 01:01:19.741
(clicks off)

919
01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:21.777
(keyboard clacking)

920
01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:24.880
<i>Shut up, you moron.</i>

921
01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:31.253
- Okay, stop.
- (beeps)

922
01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:33.855
(electronic voice)
<i>Spin faster.</i>

923
01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:36.825
(keyboard clacking)

924
01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:41.063
MARV: <i>Get in the bag.
Shut up, ya bag!</i>

925
01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:57.312
Christmas morning.
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

926
01:01:57.314 --> 01:02:00.015
Merry Christmas, Dad!
Hey, hey!

927
01:02:00.017 --> 01:02:04.252
- Peter, are you ready to go?
- Go? Go where?

928
01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:09.091
Kevin, Natalie and I gotta go pick
up the royal family right now.

929
01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:12.728
Now? But aren't we
gonna open presents?

930
01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:15.163
It's gonna have to wait
till we get back.

931
01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:18.800
But it's Christmas. And why
do you both have to go?

932
01:02:18.802 --> 01:02:22.204
Look, you know how sometimes you
gotta do things you don't wanna do?

933
01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:25.941
This is one of those times. Hey, we'll
be back before you know it, okay?

934
01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:28.176
And I'm sure nothing will happen
while we're gone. Am I right?

935
01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:30.278
- Right.
- Good.

936
01:02:31.815 --> 01:02:35.217
Hang in there.
We won't be long.

937
01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:38.186
Door, open.
(door opens)

938
01:02:40.858 --> 01:02:43.058
NATALIE:
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

939
01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:48.096
(door shuts)

940
01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.232
Merry Christmas.

941
01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:53.401
(cell phone rings)

942
01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:56.772
(ringing continues)

943
01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:04.880
- (sighs)
- (beeps on)

944
01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:06.948
Hello?

945
01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:12.053
No, we're awake.
It wasn't me!

946
01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:15.223
Shh! All right.
We're on our way.

947
01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:18.493
(beeps off) Oy. Sure
makes me nervous.

948
01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:20.929
Let's go, pookie.

949
01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:28.937
I knew it. Here they come.

950
01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:43.518
First step... eliminate the inside man.
Oh, Mr. Prescott?

951
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.354
Mr. Prescott, are you in there?
(pounding)

952
01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:49.925
Yes.
Mr. Prescott,

953
01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:52.527
can you help me with something?
And what would that be?

954
01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:55.430
Another milk shake, perhaps?
No. A bottle of wine.

955
01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:58.533
Excuse me? Natalie said we need to
get some wine from the basement...

956
01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:01.036
for the royal family.

957
01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:04.439
If we must.

958
01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:07.943
So I guess you're right.

959
01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.845
We're not gonna have
any snow this Christmas.

960
01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:13.982
One can never go wrong
with low expectations.

961
01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:18.086
You know, Mr. Prescott, it's been great
spending time with you these last few days.

962
01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:20.522
Time flies when
you're having fun.

963
01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:25.927
I know we got off to a bad start, but
things can be better... much better.

964
01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:31.967
- 'Cause you're down there, and I'm up here.
- Come get...

965
01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.135
(pounding) Young man, open this door!
Let me out of here!

966
01:04:34.137 --> 01:04:37.305
Oh! Oh, boy! Am I
glad to see you!

967
01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:40.475
The kidnappers are coming. But this
time I'm one step ahead of them.

968
01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:43.912
And I locked their accomplice in the
basement. Is this a perfect plan, or what?

969
01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:46.114
It would be, dear,
except for one thing...

970
01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:48.950
Prescott is not
their accomplice.

971
01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:54.189
I am.

972
01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:59.094
(gasps) You're...
you're the inside man?

973
01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:02.397
- I'm afraid so.
- Hey, Mom.

974
01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:08.303
We're here.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

975
01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:14.376
- Mom? He's your son?
- I told you he was a handful.

976
01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:17.379
Aah! Hey! Get off of me!
Oh, now, come on!

977
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.184
Isn't there a trapdoor
or something?

978
01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:28.123
No. Not much demand for 'em
in a wine cellar.

979
01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:32.160
Guess you're right.

980
01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:34.596
Got any good ideas?

981
01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:38.099
Not a one.

982
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:42.604
(sighs)

983
01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:49.110
I do have a cell phone though.
Perfect! May I?

984
01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:51.212
Sure.
Thanks.

985
01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:53.381
(beeping)

986
01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:56.618
(ringing, beeps on)

987
01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:59.120
Hello, Buzz?
Kevin, is that you?

988
01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.623
- Yeah. I'm calling from a cell phone.
- Oh, a cell phone.

989
01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:05.527
Good for you, puke-face. Is that another
present she gave you? What a showoff.

990
01:06:05.529 --> 01:06:07.595
(beeps off)

991
01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:10.632
- I'll try again.
- (keypad beeping)

992
01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.602
(ringing, beeps on)

993
01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:18.606
Buzz, before you hang up, I need to tell
you something. I need to talk to Mom.

994
01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:21.609
Okay. You told me.
(beeps off)

995
01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:24.245
(beeps off)
I'll try again later.

996
01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:27.349
(sighs)

997
01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:32.354
Why in heaven's name did you
think I was the inside man?

998
01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:36.992
Well, if you hadn't acted so strange,
I wouldn't have thought you were...

999
01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:39.294
so strange.

1000
01:06:39.296 --> 01:06:41.663
And where were you the first
time these guys broke in?

1001
01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:43.631
Why didn't you answer
the intercom?

1002
01:06:43.633 --> 01:06:46.067
Why did you
shut off the cameras?

1003
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:48.703
I didn't. But if those thugs
were using Molly's remote,

1004
01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:51.206
they could've turned off
the whole security system.

1005
01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:55.377
- But why'd you say I was lying?
- Well, because I thought you were.

1006
01:06:55.379 --> 01:06:58.513
And besides, I didn't want Miss
Natalie to know that I'd been,

1007
01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:01.016
well, napping on the job.

1008
01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:04.519
That woman. If she could work
me 24 hours a day, she would.

1009
01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:08.490
It's downright inhuman. So,
whenever she's not here, I, uh...

1010
01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:12.027
You take advantage.
I take a break.

1011
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:14.562
A nice, well-deserved break.

1012
01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:17.565
With all the cameras and intercoms
turned off, I didn't notice anything.

1013
01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:20.769
- So I...
- You were covering your whoo-hoo!

1014
01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:23.471
(chuckles) Precisely.

1015
01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:28.176
You want to try calling
your mom again? Sure.

1016
01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:31.112
(ringing)

1017
01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:32.714
- Hello?
- Mom?

1018
01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:35.683
Kevin!
(static)

1019
01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:39.521
- Wait. Kevin, I can't hear you.
- That's probably 'cause I'm locked in a wine cellar.

1020
01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:42.323
No, I... honey, I can't hear you.
There's too much static.

1021
01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:44.626
(yelling) I'm locked in
Natalie's wine cellar!

1022
01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:47.128
- Are you calling to say Merry Christmas?
- Mom, are you there?

1023
01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:48.763
- Sweetheart?
- Are you there, Mom?

1024
01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:51.232
- Kevin?
- Mom? Mom?

1025
01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.268
(beeps off)

1026
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:56.104
Oh, great!

1027
01:07:56.106 --> 01:07:57.672
The battery's dead.

1028
01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.342
(sighs)

1029
01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:03.411
Hmm.

1030
01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:11.453
(ringing)

1031
01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:13.855
- (beeps on)
- Kalban residence.

1032
01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:17.525
Hi, this is Kate McCallister, Kevin's mom.
May I speak to him, please?

1033
01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:22.797
Kevin's not here right now. That's strange.
He just called.

1034
01:08:22.799 --> 01:08:28.536
Really? Well, he's out with
his father and Miss Natalie.

1035
01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:32.507
Oh. Oh, he must have called from his dad's
cell phone. That explains the line going dead.

1036
01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.542
Okay. Thank you.

1037
01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:36.544
(clicks, dial tone)

1038
01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.646
(beeps off)

1039
01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:47.522
Little rascal called his mother.

1040
01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:50.758
You want me to go show him who's boss?
Sit down, Marv.

1041
01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.161
You're not the boss.
I'm the boss.

1042
01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:55.830
Okay.

1043
01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:59.234
(mouthing words)

1044
01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:03.138
His cell phone is dead. I don't
think he'll be any more trouble.

1045
01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.414
No.

1046
01:09:14.351 --> 01:09:16.618
Cookie.

1047
01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.720
- (cell phone rings)
- Oh!

1048
01:09:20.257 --> 01:09:22.490
- (beeps on)
- Hello?

1049
01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:25.326
Peter, it's me. I'm calling Kevin back.
We got disconnected.

1050
01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.896
Kevin? Kevin's not with me.
He's back at Natalie's house.

1051
01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:31.266
Really? I was just told
he's with you.

1052
01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:34.536
Well... well, don't worry, Kate.
I'm sure everything's fine.

1053
01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:38.406
Okay.

1054
01:09:38.408 --> 01:09:41.242
- Wow, that's weird.
- (phone beeps off)

1055
01:09:41.244 --> 01:09:44.846
- Someone told Kate that Kevin's with us.
- Hmm.

1056
01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:47.815
Maybe I better go back
and check on him. No.

1057
01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:51.553
That's exactly what he wants.
Peter, he's manipulating you.

1058
01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:54.689
Can't you see the pattern? Every time
we leave the house, he pulls something.

1059
01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:58.793
He's just trying to get your
attention and sabotage me.

1060
01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:05.900
Hello!
Anybody out there? Hello!

1061
01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:15.877
There's gotta be something that
we can do to get outta here.

1062
01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:23.218
There is.

1063
01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.721
Help me move these boxes. Okay.

1064
01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.723
But what's back there?

1065
01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:31.593
Definitely not
a "dumb" question.

1066
01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:34.329
The dumbwaiter!
Bingo.

1067
01:10:34.331 --> 01:10:37.765
- Let's hope it still works.
- I'm sorry I misjudged you, Mr. Prescott.

1068
01:10:39.703 --> 01:10:41.669
Likewise.

1069
01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:46.241
I'll never forget
Miss Natalie's reaction...

1070
01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:48.610
when she came home and saw
what you'd done to the house.

1071
01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:51.913
- (rapid panting)
- (wheezing, laughing)

1072
01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:55.250
I do love watching her hyperventilate!
(laughs)

1073
01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:58.286
It's one of the few pleasures
of this job.

1074
01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:00.488
If you hate this job,
why don't you quit?

1075
01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.424
Jobs aren't that easy
to come by.

1076
01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.427
Besides, I could end up
working for someone far worse.

1077
01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:11.733
You shouldn't stay someplace you hate just
'cause you're scared. Life's too short.

1078
01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:15.270
Hmm.

1079
01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:18.306
And voila.

1080
01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:21.276
Let's see if you fit.

1081
01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:23.511
Mm, up.

1082
01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:27.715
Watch your head. As soon as I
get up, I'm gonna let you out.

1083
01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:32.053
You just take care of yourself, you hear?
(switch clicks, whirring)

1084
01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:42.363
MARV: I'm tellin' ya,
I heard something.

1085
01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:48.569
All right.
Stay very alert here, Vera.

1086
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:51.039
I tell you what. Why don't you go
down, check out the wine cellar?

1087
01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:53.474
Okay.
Yeah. There you go.

1088
01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:57.879
KEVIN: Down here!

1089
01:12:00.617 --> 01:12:03.384
You better stay... Oww!

1090
01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:06.821
Vera! Ow! Aah! Vera!

1091
01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:09.324
What? Ooh!
Hit the button!

1092
01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:12.026
- Hang on, baby! Huuh!
- Oh! No, no! Hit the button!

1093
01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:15.363
What? I can't hear you.
Hit the button!

1094
01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:17.832
- Oh!
- Oww!

1095
01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.935
No, no! Not that one!
The other button!

1096
01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:23.871
That's it! Oww!

1097
01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:27.642
Hey!

1098
01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:30.745
Man!

1099
01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:33.448
Over here!

1100
01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:37.885
- (groaning)
- (Kevin laughing )

1101
01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:44.092
- Hi, Mommy.
- (gasps)

1102
01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:02.744
- Yes!
- (clicking buttons)

1103
01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:05.680
See ya. Door, open!

1104
01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:07.715
(grinding)

1105
01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:19.560
Natalie, you go get the royals. I'm
gonna go back and check on Kevin.

1106
01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:22.997
- What, now?
- Yeah, somethin's up. I can sense it.

1107
01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:27.635
- Maybe you have to be a parent.
- That's not fair. You know how much I care about kids.

1108
01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:30.671
How much do you care
about my kid?

1109
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.410
Taxi!

1110
01:13:37.614 --> 01:13:40.415
Kevin? Are you all right?

1111
01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:49.157
(grunting)

1112
01:13:57.066 --> 01:13:59.100
(horn honking)

1113
01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:06.674
Mom, do you think you could slow down
a little bit? Kevin's probably fine.

1114
01:14:06.676 --> 01:14:09.076
You just keep an eye out
for cops, okay?

1115
01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:13.181
All right, Vera. Go check out the living
room. See if he's in there, all right?

1116
01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:15.917
God! I can't believe this.

1117
01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:20.121
I shoulda gone to college. Two years,
coulda been a dental technician. Two years!

1118
01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:22.657
Marv! He's in the bedroom!

1119
01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:25.593
- Mom?
- Get him!

1120
01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:30.465
Door, open.

1121
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:42.710
Got ya.

1122
01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:55.523
Uuh! Gaah!

1123
01:14:56.259 --> 01:14:58.759
Aah!

1124
01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:01.028
Ooh!

1125
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:03.264
Door, close.

1126
01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:10.204
- Hey, Molly!
- Get in there!

1127
01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:17.245
- Marv, honey. You in there?
- (beeps)

1128
01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:19.247
<i>Shut up, Vera!</i>

1129
01:15:19.249 --> 01:15:22.049
Well, okay.
I was just tryin' to...

1130
01:15:22.051 --> 01:15:25.820
<i>- Shut up, you moron.</i>
- Hey, I'm no moron, you jerk.

1131
01:15:25.822 --> 01:15:28.856
<i>- Shut up, ya bag!</i>
- Door, open!

1132
01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:36.964
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

1133
01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:39.567
I'm no bag. And you know what?
You ain't no genius!

1134
01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:41.802
Vera, honey...
No! Don't "Vera, honey" me!

1135
01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:44.305
You're not even as smart as this kid,
who, in case you hadn't noticed...

1136
01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:46.073
is totally kickin' our butts!

1137
01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:49.076
Well, from now on,
I am my own boss!

1138
01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:52.046
Vera. Vera, honey...
Don't "honey" me!

1139
01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.982
Pumpkin. Pumpkin.

1140
01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:59.120
Marv! Forget about her! Get the kid!
I'll be outta here in a few minutes.

1141
01:15:59.122 --> 01:16:01.556
(buzzing)

1142
01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:08.963
(thuds, buzzing stops)

1143
01:16:09.933 --> 01:16:12.600
Oh!

1144
01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:14.802
(chuckling)

1145
01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:17.271
Whoa!

1146
01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:19.840
(yelping)

1147
01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:25.346
(both groaning)

1148
01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:34.055
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:36.257
Open sesame.

1150
01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:39.860
Well, get a load of that.
Holy majolie!

1151
01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:46.901
Come on, Vera!
All right! Come on out, kid!

1152
01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:49.103
Ah! All right.

1153
01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.239
Open bar. Open bookshelf.
(buzzes)

1154
01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:55.142
Open... open book-bar.
Open book-bar-shelf.

1155
01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:58.779
Open... open book-bar-thing.
Open sesame.

1156
01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.948
That's stupid.
Whoa!

1157
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.651
Who's stupid now, stupid? Hey, come on.
Just get off me, all right?

1158
01:17:03.653 --> 01:17:06.087
MARV: I'm gonna take
care of everything.

1159
01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:08.055
Bar, revolve sesame.

1160
01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:10.725
MARV: Watch this.
It's all gonna be fine.

1161
01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:13.094
Bar, stop. Oh!
It's goin' faster!

1162
01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:16.797
Yeah, I know, Vera.
I know it's goin' faster.

1163
01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:20.134
- Speed faster sesame.
- Okay. The wife's not feelin'...

1164
01:17:21.704 --> 01:17:22.903
Faster sesame!

1165
01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:31.812
- (panicked yelling)
- Maximum speed sesame.

1166
01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:36.117
(Kevin laughing)

1167
01:17:39.389 --> 01:17:41.756
Stop sesame.
(gasps)

1168
01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:55.970
(screaming)

1169
01:17:58.975 --> 01:18:00.941
Nice jump, Marv.

1170
01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:03.210
(groaning)

1171
01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:14.455
Ohh!
(gasping)

1172
01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:19.260
Oof!

1173
01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:36.310
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

1174
01:18:36.312 --> 01:18:38.979
Good night. Aah!
(Kevin gasps)

1175
01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:44.852
- Mr. Prescott!
- At your service.

1176
01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:47.755
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- (chuckles)

1177
01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:51.325
Perhaps we should call the police.
Good idea, Mr. Prescott.

1178
01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:54.261
Just "Prescott" to you.

1179
01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.733
"Prescott!"

1180
01:19:08.177 --> 01:19:10.911
I thought you said you weren't worried.
I don't know.

1181
01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:14.048
I just had a feeling.

1182
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:16.984
- (Marv, Vera gasping)
- PETER: Kevin!

1183
01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:19.453
Dad!

1184
01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:22.323
Mom!
Mom?

1185
01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:24.992
- Who are they?
- Uh-oh!

1186
01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:27.261
Let's get outta here!
Around the back!

1187
01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.497
We're on it. Let's go! Kevin!

1188
01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.442
Ooh-ooh!

1189
01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:44.445
Yes!

1190
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:48.282
Uuh!
Yeah! Way to go, guys!

1191
01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:50.417
KATE:
Kevin!

1192
01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:54.221
- Kevin!
- Mom!

1193
01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:57.458
Oh, honey! I'm so glad
you're all right. Ohh!

1194
01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.461
I am now! I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

1195
01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:03.397
- Mmm!
- (Prescott clears throat)

1196
01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:06.100
The police have been summoned.

1197
01:20:06.102 --> 01:20:08.369
I've got lots of fun
planned for your stay.

1198
01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:12.540
Can we go to Wrigley Field? And the
aquarium? Do you have any kids?

1199
01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:17.945
No. But I promise we'll have
a very exciting time.

1200
01:20:17.947 --> 01:20:20.981
- (sirens wailing)
- Cool!

1201
01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:29.456
Oh, come on. No, prison's not so bad.
Oh, yeah?

1202
01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:32.459
Yeah. On Thursdays you get Salisbury steak.
Yeah, I know about prison.

1203
01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:34.295
That's where I met you.
Calm down. Calm down.

1204
01:20:34.297 --> 01:20:36.497
You calm down.
Women, eh?

1205
01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.999
Yeah.
Hey, don't touch me.

1206
01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:46.207
- Peter! What's he done now?
- Well, he saved the day, that's what.

1207
01:20:46.209 --> 01:20:49.310
You should be thanking him.

1208
01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:52.413
Molly? What in the world
is going on?

1209
01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:56.617
It seems they were gonna kidnap the prince.
Best we can gather, she's the boss.

1210
01:20:56.619 --> 01:21:00.154
She's my maid.
I'm her boss!

1211
01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:02.456
Well, looks like you're
gonna have to find a new maid.

1212
01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:07.027
And a new butler, I'm afraid.

1213
01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:09.563
- I resign.
- Resign?

1214
01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:11.999
But... why?

1215
01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:16.537
Because as a wise young man
once said, "Life's too short."

1216
01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:21.175
Peter, do something.

1217
01:21:23.479 --> 01:21:27.181
All right. Here goes.

1218
01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:32.052
Natalie, I think I mistook...

1219
01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:35.322
infatuation and excitement
for love.

1220
01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:39.460
Look, this... this is your world.
It's not mine.

1221
01:21:39.462 --> 01:21:42.630
The whole time I was here,
all I did was miss my family.

1222
01:21:42.632 --> 01:21:45.065
I'm in love
with my wife and kids,

1223
01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:48.002
and I belong with them.

1224
01:21:48.004 --> 01:21:52.439
And I wanna come home. I mean, I understand
if you need time to think about it.

1225
01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:56.410
Mom?

1226
01:21:59.949 --> 01:22:01.982
Oh!
(crying)

1227
01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:03.651
I love you.
I love you.

1228
01:22:05.554 --> 01:22:09.657
Young man, how are we ever
going to show you our gratitude?

1229
01:22:09.659 --> 01:22:12.626
Would your family like to spend
Christmas with our family?

1230
01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:15.229
That sounds cool.

1231
01:22:15.231 --> 01:22:17.398
- Is that okay?
- (chuckles) Yes.

1232
01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.067
You're going to be with them?

1233
01:22:20.069 --> 01:22:23.537
Today? On Christmas?

1234
01:22:23.539 --> 01:22:26.407
(crying)

1235
01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:29.510
(panting)

1236
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.480
Thank you.

1237
01:22:35.151 --> 01:22:38.485
Music, on.
(Christmas music playing)

1238
01:22:40.022 --> 01:22:42.690
Snow, fall.

1239
01:22:42.692 --> 01:22:45.526
Ha ha! Hey!

1240
01:22:45.528 --> 01:22:48.228
I knew this was gonna be
the best Christmas ever!

1241
01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:50.698
(all exclaiming)
