00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.012
Viv, I know there are only
three shopping days left,
but they called,

2
00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:23.011
And they want to see
your house in an hour.

3
00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:25.016
(rock music playing)
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:27.016
Mom! Make Buzz
turn off the music.
(pop music playing)

5
00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:29.018
No problem.
Mom!

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.023
- "Mom."
- Hang on, Viv.

7
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.020
Let your sister rehearse.
Like that'll help.

8
00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:35.022
And clean up the kitchen.
<i>But--</i>

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.016
Now. Okay, Viv.
I'll see you in a bit.

10
00:00:38.018 --> 00:00:40.018
I thought I told you
to clean up the kitchen.

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.015
I did. Can I go to the movies
tonight with some friends?
No.

12
00:00:43.017 --> 00:00:47.007
No--
No, no. I'm showing a house and
I need you to baby-sit Kevin.

13
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:48.020
Well, why can't Megan do it?

14
00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:50.018
Because she has to go
to rehearsal at the teen center.

15
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.007
And you don't <i>have</i>
to go to the movies.
I do if I want a life.

16
00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:57.006
You're baby-sitting Kevin.
Hey, where is he, anyway? Kevin.

17
00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.019
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
BOY: <i>A car!</i>

18
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:01.023
<i>Whoa!</i>
MAN:
<i>Wait a second. That was--</i>

19
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.007
<i>Honey, that was mine.</i>

20
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.020
BUZZ (on tv):
<i>Awesome. It's got an antenna</i>
<i>and everything.</i>

21
00:01:06.022 --> 00:01:09.011
DAD:
<i>Merry Christmas, Mommy.</i>
BOY: <i>Merry Christmas.</i>

22
00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:12.000
MOM (on tv):
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

23
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.004
DAD:
<i>What did I get?</i>
BUZZ: <i>What is this?</i>

24
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.013
Megan: <i>Thank you.</i>
MOM:
<i>Everybody get in the shot.</i>

25
00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:19.010
<i>Everybody get together.</i>
BUZZ:
<i>Okay.</i>

26
00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.002
MOM (on tv):
<i>All right. Merry Christmas.</i>
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

27
00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.001
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>
<i>Very funny, Buzz.</i>

28
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:27.001
<i>(Mom laughing on TV)</i>

29
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.006
- Last Christmas, huh?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.005
This Christmas isn't
gonna be any fun.

31
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.012
Of course
it will.

32
00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:42.004
Honey, we're gonna do
all the same things
we've always done.

33
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.019
Sing Christmas carols,
be with family and friends,

34
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:49.014
Put cookies and milk
out for Santa.

35
00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:52.021
- It's gonna be just the same.
- Except this year,

36
00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:55.004
no Dad.

37
00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:58.011
Right. That's the one thing
that's different.

38
00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:00.017
Why can't you just
get back together?

39
00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.013
(sighs) Honey, we're just gonna
have to let that go.

40
00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:08.005
<i>(chattering on TV)</i>
That's a no, right?

41
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:11.022
It means some things are
just out of our control.

42
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.004
I know you miss your dad.

43
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.020
And he loves me very much.

44
00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:21.002
You both do, and it has
nothing to do with me.

45
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:25.002
- Did he tell you that?
- I'm nine years old.
I watch a lot of tv.

46
00:02:26.023 --> 00:02:29.004
Did he leave
because of me?

47
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.009
No. Of course not.

48
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:35.016
I knew it.
It was Buzz and Megan.
(chuckles)

49
00:02:35.018 --> 00:02:39.015
Oh, it wasn't anyone...
Or any one thing.

50
00:02:39.017 --> 00:02:42.013
Then what was it?

51
00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:46.011
That's not easy to explain.

52
00:02:46.013 --> 00:02:49.019
But, uh, sometimes when...

53
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:53.013
people are married for
a long time, they get into
kind of a rut.

54
00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:57.012
You know what a rut is?
Yeah. Like, when people
aren't having any fun,

55
00:02:57.014 --> 00:02:59.010
and they're really bored.

56
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.023
Kind of like that.

57
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.017
Now, will you
come downstairs?

58
00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.018
When you're ready.

59
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:10.008
<i>(chattering on TV)</i>

60
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:16.000
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>(clapping)</i>

61
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.022
<i>Wait a second.</i>

62
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.013
Megan: Kevin, come in here.
BUZZ: Yeah, hurry,
you've gotta see this!

63
00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:30.004
(groans)
Ow! Hey! Hey!

64
00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:32.021
- You always fall for that.
- Let me up, zit-face!

65
00:03:32.023 --> 00:03:35.016
- Lamebrain.
When are you gonna learn?
- Get off your brother.

66
00:03:35.018 --> 00:03:38.013
- And shouldn't
you be rehearsing?
-(Kevin grunting)

67
00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:41.021
- How are you getting
to the teen center?
- Ashley's mom's picking me up
in a half hour.

68
00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:44.005
(grunting continues)
Can I please
go to the movies?

69
00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:46.006
No. I told you.
You're watching Kevin.

70
00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:48.018
- Please let him go.
I'll stay home alone.
- No.

71
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.021
- (scoffs)
I've done it before.
- Don't remind me.

72
00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:56.000
You loused up
my whole night.

73
00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.007
If I'm gonna be miserable,
you're gonna be miserable.

74
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.007
Mom!
(door opens)

75
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.022
MAN:
Hello. It's me.
Dad!

76
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.023
Dad!
Hey, big guy.

77
00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:07.014
(growls playfully)
I didn't know
you were coming tonight.

78
00:04:07.016 --> 00:04:09.013
Oh, I thought
I'd surprise you.
Hey, Dad.

79
00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:12.012
Hey, Buzz.

80
00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:15.020
Oh, Kate. Gosh,
the place looks great.

81
00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:18.018
Really nice decorations.

82
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.022
- Same as every year.
- KEVIN: So, um,

83
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.016
Dad, why'd you
come tonight?

84
00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:25.007
Actually,
I want to talk to
your mom about something.

85
00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:31.005
Privately.

86
00:04:31.007 --> 00:04:34.001
Do you think
he wants to come home?
Aw, Kev.

87
00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:37.001
(huffs)

88
00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:39.017
What?
No "Hello, how are ya?"

89
00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:42.018
I'm sorry. I have
a business appointment,
Peter. What do you want?

90
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.018
Okay, gosh.
I wasn't gonna
jump right into it, but--

91
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.010
Well, you know Natalie
and I are living together,
and, uh,

92
00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:54.004
well, when our divorce is final,
I'm gonna marry her.

93
00:04:56.017 --> 00:04:57.016
Really?

94
00:04:59.022 --> 00:05:02.011
You're getting married again.

95
00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:11.005
Wow. That's, uh--
that--

96
00:05:11.007 --> 00:05:13.021
(exhales) Wow. We've only been
separated eight months.

97
00:05:13.023 --> 00:05:18.014
Yeah, I-- it just
happened real quickly, and--
listen, Kate,

98
00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:22.003
I really want the kids
to spend a little time
with me over the holidays.

99
00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:24.015
You want the kids for Christmas?

100
00:05:24.017 --> 00:05:28.000
Just a couple of days.
I want them to get
to know Natalie better.

101
00:05:29.022 --> 00:05:33.012
Oh, because she's gonna be
their, uh, stepmother.

102
00:05:33.014 --> 00:05:35.015
Yeah.

103
00:05:40.002 --> 00:05:42.008
Well, you're gonna
have to ask them.

104
00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:46.003
I know.

105
00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:48.023
- How am I supposed to
see my friends?
- It's only for a few days.

106
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:52.013
Well, duh, but that's
just long enough for me
to fall out of the loop.

107
00:05:52.015 --> 00:05:56.020
- Yeah, you can't expect us
to give up our vacation.
- Well, Kevin?

108
00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:59.007
There's a royal family
coming to visit.

109
00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.007
They have a son around your age.
You might have a chance
to play with a crown prince.

110
00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.002
A crown prince?
Wouldn't that be cool?

111
00:06:06.004 --> 00:06:09.010
- Yeah, way cool.
- And you guys wouldn't believe
the room

112
00:06:09.012 --> 00:06:12.003
that Natalie has
set up for you.

113
00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:14.004
What do you say?

114
00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:22.011
- I think I'm gonna pass.
- (exhales)

115
00:06:22.013 --> 00:06:26.002
It just wouldn't be right
leaving the family
at Christmas.

116
00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:28.017
I'm sure you understand.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

117
00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:33.021
Well, it's-- it's
an open invitation, hmm?

118
00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:38.016
And I won't be
back too late.

119
00:06:38.018 --> 00:06:41.021
And since you're staying home,
it wouldn't hurt to do
some of your chores.

120
00:06:41.023 --> 00:06:45.009
Yes, ma'am.
I'll make sure they get done.

121
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Clean it, cheese-face.

122
00:07:10.014 --> 00:07:13.002
Ow!

123
00:07:18.018 --> 00:07:21.007
Oops.

124
00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.011
My fault.

125
00:07:30.021 --> 00:07:32.019
Hello, I'm home.

126
00:07:34.003 --> 00:07:36.003
Hey.

127
00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:38.017
How'd it go?
Awful.

128
00:07:38.019 --> 00:07:42.004
I hate Buzz and I never
want to be stuck home alone
with him as long as I live.

129
00:07:42.006 --> 00:07:45.013
Oh, honey.
I know he picks on you.

130
00:07:45.015 --> 00:07:48.014
Picks on me?
Humiliates me,
tortures me.

131
00:07:48.016 --> 00:07:50.019
I'm sick of being everyone's
favorite joke around here.

132
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:54.004
Yeah. Yeah,
it's hard to be the youngest.

133
00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:58.002
Well, I hate Buzz.
I wish I didn't have
a brother or a sister.

134
00:07:58.004 --> 00:08:00.017
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do!

135
00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:03.003
I wish I was
an only child!

136
00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:11.012
Well, I'm sorry that
you're so unhappy.

137
00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:15.015
Maybe you should go to your room
and think about what you have,
rather than what you don't have.

138
00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:19.008
(scoffs)

139
00:08:21.004 --> 00:08:23.008
(sighs)

140
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.007
Only children don't know
how good they have it.

141
00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:30.002
Life would be perfect if
Buzz and Megan weren't around.

142
00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:37.018
I mean, is it too much
to ask for a family
who actually likes me?

143
00:08:39.012 --> 00:08:42.002
(sighs)
I'd run away.

144
00:08:42.004 --> 00:08:44.020
If I knew where to run to.

145
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.000
Hey, I do!

146
00:08:50.002 --> 00:08:52.008
I have an open invitation.

147
00:08:54.009 --> 00:08:56.013
(coins jingling)

148
00:08:58.022 --> 00:09:02.004
PETER:
Can't get my seat belt
unfastened.

149
00:09:02.006 --> 00:09:04.010
(woman laughs)

150
00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:13.023
PETER:
Thanks, Alan.

151
00:09:15.023 --> 00:09:17.023
Thanks.

152
00:09:19.004 --> 00:09:21.009
Oh, what an incredible evening.

153
00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:23.013
And not a bad night's work.

154
00:09:23.015 --> 00:09:26.005
We raised over two million
for those children's charities.

155
00:09:26.007 --> 00:09:28.021
Door, open.

156
00:09:34.002 --> 00:09:38.008
And I am on the verge
of signing two of
the biggest clients in
Chicago.

157
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.015
That's because you're
the best publicist
in the world.

158
00:09:41.017 --> 00:09:46.001
- Doors, close.
- Have I remembered to thank you
for telling everyone that?

159
00:09:46.003 --> 00:09:48.000
Fire, light.
Not tonight you haven't.

160
00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:49.023
Perhaps I ought to
show my appreciation.

161
00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:52.005
Music, on.
(classical music starts)

162
00:09:52.007 --> 00:09:54.017
Curtains, close.
(chuckles)

163
00:10:00.006 --> 00:10:04.020
Aw, nuts. Just when
things were getting good.

164
00:10:04.022 --> 00:10:07.008
Nice house, huh, pumpkin?

165
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.008
Sure is, Marv. You sure
you don't wanna rob it?

166
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.017
No. No, I don't wanna rob it.

167
00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:17.004
My robbery days are over.
Darling, we're moving up
to the big money. All right?

168
00:10:17.006 --> 00:10:19.010
The easy money.
No middleman.

169
00:10:19.012 --> 00:10:22.018
Pure profit. Strictly
a class operation, huh?

170
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.018
Three words, Vera.
Kid-- na-- pping.

171
00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:30.000
I think that's only one word.

172
00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:32.002
We're gonna wait for
the royals to arrive--

173
00:10:32.004 --> 00:10:35.018
Hup, dup, dodey-do--
and then we're
gonna kidnap the prince.

174
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.015
(high-pitched voice)
"Oh, don't kidnap me.
I'm fancy."

175
00:10:38.017 --> 00:10:40.015
You sure we can pull it off?

176
00:10:40.017 --> 00:10:42.018
I mean, without
Harry making the plans?

177
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.016
Look where Harry's plans
kept landing me, huh?
In jail.

178
00:10:46.018 --> 00:10:48.019
Well, not this time.
Because this time...

179
00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:50.021
I'm the boss.

180
00:10:50.023 --> 00:10:52.021
- (scoffs)
- Who's the boss?

181
00:10:52.023 --> 00:10:56.003
- You're the boss.
- I love being married. Eh?

182
00:11:05.006 --> 00:11:07.011
- That's my girl.
- Hey!

183
00:11:07.013 --> 00:11:10.015
Oh! Looks like
they got a visitor.

184
00:11:32.023 --> 00:11:35.006
This where you want to go?

185
00:11:35.008 --> 00:11:38.022
Yeah, this is the place.
Thank you very much.
(coins jingling)

186
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.001
Keep the change.

187
00:11:41.003 --> 00:11:43.004
It's <i>all</i><i>change.</i>

188
00:11:57.021 --> 00:12:00.013
(snoring)

189
00:12:02.016 --> 00:12:05.009
(beep)

190
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:08.018
(sighs)

191
00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:21.019
Who are you?

192
00:12:23.012 --> 00:12:25.014
(gulps)

193
00:12:25.016 --> 00:12:27.022
MAN (on speaker):
<i>Beg your pardon, ma'am.</i>

194
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.023
Yes, Prescott?

195
00:12:30.001 --> 00:12:34.000
Mr. McCallister has a visitor.
The young man claims
to be his son.

196
00:12:34.002 --> 00:12:36.009
Well, send him in.

197
00:12:39.015 --> 00:12:41.019
- Kevin!
- Dad!

198
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:45.010
Hey! Oh! I thought
you said weren't coming.

199
00:12:45.012 --> 00:12:49.008
Well, I started thinking, hey,
it's not fair if Mom gets
all the kids for Christmas.

200
00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.012
(chuckling)
What's Christmas
without kids, right?

201
00:12:51.014 --> 00:12:54.001
Right. Hello, Kevin.

202
00:12:54.003 --> 00:12:56.015
Hi, Natalie.
I hope you don't mind me
just dropping in like this,

203
00:12:56.017 --> 00:12:58.016
But my dad did invite me.

204
00:12:58.018 --> 00:13:01.017
- Yes, I know.
- So is the invitation
still open?

205
00:13:01.019 --> 00:13:06.002
Of course it is.
Molly, would you
come here, please?

206
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.021
I've been looking forward
to spending time with you.

207
00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:13.006
Your dad talks about
you kids a lot.

208
00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:15.013
Buzz is the troublemaker.
I'm the adorable one.

209
00:13:15.015 --> 00:13:18.013
Oh. Ah, Molly.

210
00:13:18.015 --> 00:13:22.000
This is Kevin McCallister,
and he's going to be staying
with us for a few days.

211
00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:23.023
Would you make up
the special guest room?

212
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:26.017
Ah, the special guest room.

213
00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:28.004
Right away, ma'am.

214
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.014
- Oh, and Prescott,
give Kevin a house key.
- If you say so, ma' am.

215
00:13:40.008 --> 00:13:42.019
What kind of key is this?

216
00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:44.021
It's a key to the whole house.

217
00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:47.023
This is a smart house, Kevin.
It does whatever
you tell it to.

218
00:13:48.001 --> 00:13:50.005
Fire, out.

219
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:55.015
Curtains, open.

220
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.014
Wow! I think
I'm gonna like it here.

221
00:14:03.022 --> 00:14:06.000
Go ahead. You try.

222
00:14:07.023 --> 00:14:10.009
Door, open.

223
00:14:21.006 --> 00:14:23.016
Wow! This stuff
is so cool.

224
00:14:23.018 --> 00:14:26.016
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

225
00:14:26.018 --> 00:14:29.005
This is such cool stuff! Ah!

226
00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:32.013
Oh! Look at this game!

227
00:14:32.015 --> 00:14:35.015
This chair's
a remote control chair! Oh!

228
00:14:35.017 --> 00:14:37.023
Oh, yeah!

229
00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:40.013
This is so cool! Oh!

230
00:14:40.015 --> 00:14:43.000
- Think you'll
be comfortable here?
- I'll say!

231
00:14:43.002 --> 00:14:46.016
Thanks, Natalie.
This is gonna be
the best Christmas ever!

232
00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:48.021
Lights out, Kev.

233
00:14:50.008 --> 00:14:52.020
Hey, Kevin?

234
00:14:52.022 --> 00:14:55.015
Kevin.

235
00:14:55.017 --> 00:14:57.017
How many times
can I lose this child?

236
00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:00.001
Kevin.
(cell phone rings)

237
00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:04.001
Hello.
PETER: Kate, I...

238
00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:06.006
wanted to let you know
Kevin just got here.

239
00:15:06.008 --> 00:15:08.019
Oh, thank God...

240
00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:12.023
He got there... safely.

241
00:15:13.001 --> 00:15:15.017
- I was gonna call you,
but uh--
- Are you okay?

242
00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:20.006
Yeah. Yes, I'm fine.

243
00:15:20.008 --> 00:15:23.006
Well, thanks for
letting him come.

244
00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:28.007
- Well, thanks for calling.
- Merry Christmas.

245
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.022
Merry Christmas.

246
00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:51.010
MOLLY'S VOICE:
<i>Good mornin', Kevin.</i>

247
00:15:51.012 --> 00:15:53.012
Good morning.

248
00:15:53.014 --> 00:15:57.001
Who's there?
<i>Over here, dear.</i>

249
00:15:57.003 --> 00:16:00.018
Hey. Hi.

250
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.010
<i>Breakfast time.</i>
<i>Anything special you'd like?</i>

251
00:16:03.012 --> 00:16:05.003
Anything?

252
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:07.007
<i>Anything.</i>

253
00:16:33.013 --> 00:16:35.018
- Wow!
- Sometimes I can't wait
for Santa to come,

254
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.021
so I end up doing
some shopping by myself.

255
00:16:38.023 --> 00:16:41.007
Would you like to open one?
No, you're gonna spoil him.

256
00:16:41.009 --> 00:16:45.013
Dad, it's her house.
If she wants to spoil me,
she can spoil me.

257
00:16:45.015 --> 00:16:48.012
All right.
All right.
But just one.

258
00:16:48.014 --> 00:16:50.013
And not...
The biggest one.

259
00:16:53.004 --> 00:16:55.003
Does it really fly?

260
00:16:55.005 --> 00:16:57.011
It really does,
but only outside.

261
00:16:57.013 --> 00:16:59.020
NATALIE:
We don't want to break anything.
Wow! Thanks, Natalie!

262
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.011
Why do you have to leave?
It's so close to Christmas.

263
00:17:07.013 --> 00:17:11.011
Yeah, I know, but the royal
family's coming for one
of Natalie's fund-raisers,

264
00:17:11.013 --> 00:17:16.001
and it's my job to make sure
the event's well-covered
by press and photographers.

265
00:17:16.003 --> 00:17:21.010
Hey, it's not gonna take
that long, and I won't have
to work for the rest
of your vacation, okay?

266
00:17:21.012 --> 00:17:24.016
And if you need anything,
ask Prescott.
He'll take care of you.

267
00:17:24.018 --> 00:17:27.005
It's a cool plane, huh?

268
00:17:27.007 --> 00:17:29.000
I think she's trying
to buy my affection.

269
00:17:29.002 --> 00:17:31.014
- (chuckles)
Kevin.
- What?

270
00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:34.004
I'm not saying
it's a bad thing.

271
00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:37.006
I'm glad you're here.

272
00:17:39.009 --> 00:17:41.012
(engine starts)

273
00:18:04.002 --> 00:18:06.007
Mr. Prescott,
can I ask you a question?

274
00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:11.011
- Yes.
- Can you make a milk shake?

275
00:18:17.002 --> 00:18:19.001
Do you have chocolate?

276
00:18:19.003 --> 00:18:21.015
What? Natalie said
anything I need.

277
00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:25.001
And you need a milk shake,
do you?
A chocolate one.

278
00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:28.001
- Do you think
we'll have a white Christmas?
- It seems highly unlikely,

279
00:18:28.003 --> 00:18:30.008
given the recent
unseasonable temperatures.

280
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.004
What's this thing?
A mini elevator?

281
00:18:34.011 --> 00:18:36.015
It's called a dumbwaiter.

282
00:18:36.017 --> 00:18:39.020
- Why is it called a waiter?
- Because it carries food.

283
00:18:39.022 --> 00:18:42.001
- Why is it called dumb?
- Because it doesn't speak...

284
00:18:42.003 --> 00:18:44.002
or ask countless
idiotic questions.

285
00:18:46.007 --> 00:18:48.020
(machine whirring)

286
00:19:19.013 --> 00:19:22.000
- Can you read?
- (gasps)

287
00:19:22.002 --> 00:19:25.000
The door.
"No entry."

288
00:19:25.002 --> 00:19:28.002
- What, does that mean me?
- Especially you.

289
00:19:35.012 --> 00:19:39.004
This is the control center
from which I manage
this entire household...

290
00:19:39.006 --> 00:19:41.006
as well as
my personal quarters.

291
00:19:41.008 --> 00:19:43.020
Now, Miss Natalie may have
granted you run of her home,

292
00:19:43.022 --> 00:19:47.009
but this is my domain
and strictly off-limits.

293
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.012
Understood?

294
00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:52.007
Any more questions?

295
00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:54.011
Good.

296
00:19:59.011 --> 00:20:03.009
(humming)

297
00:20:05.014 --> 00:20:08.006
Hey, Molly.
Whatcha doing?

298
00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:10.009
Cleanin' the house.

299
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:14.000
- Gross.
- Oh, no, no. Not in this house.

300
00:20:14.002 --> 00:20:17.014
Watch. Vacuum, on.

301
00:20:22.017 --> 00:20:27.000
- Vacuum, off.
- Wow! The place even
cleans itself!

302
00:20:27.002 --> 00:20:29.008
Want to see somethin'
really cool?

303
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.019
Open sesame.

304
00:20:37.004 --> 00:20:40.002
Wow! This place is awesome.

305
00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:43.000

that dear child.

329
00:22:01.003 --> 00:22:03.009
Door, open.

330
00:22:10.017 --> 00:22:12.021
MARV:
She's out of the house.

331
00:22:17.001 --> 00:22:18.023
All right.
The coast is clear.

332
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:22.009
Let's go.
Wait. Are you sure
it's safe?

333
00:22:22.011 --> 00:22:24.021
Pumpkin, would I take you
in there if it wasn't safe?

334
00:22:24.023 --> 00:22:29.022
It's just if the prince
don't arrive till tomorrow,
why are we going in there now?

335
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.014
To get the lay of the land.
What do ya think, Vera,

336
00:22:32.016 --> 00:22:35.020
We're just gonna
go in there tomorrow
and start grabbing kids?

337
00:22:35.022 --> 00:22:39.012
"Ooh, everybody
get in the van." No.

338
00:22:39.014 --> 00:22:44.003
We gotta figure out
the where, the when, the how
to get him out of there.

339
00:22:44.005 --> 00:22:46.007
Do you know the secret
to criminal success?

340
00:22:46.009 --> 00:22:48.012
Not getting caught.

341
00:22:48.014 --> 00:22:51.011
Planning. Preparation.
Preparedness.

342
00:22:51.013 --> 00:22:53.011
Be prepared.
Be a prepared "preperator."

343
00:22:53.013 --> 00:22:56.010
Eh? That's my motto,
and that's why I'm--

344
00:22:56.012 --> 00:22:59.013
A boy scout.
No. The boss, eh?

345
00:22:59.015 --> 00:23:02.001
Who's the boss?
You're the boss!

346
00:23:02.003 --> 00:23:04.001
Where's the boss?
Right here.

347
00:23:04.003 --> 00:23:07.000
Hey. Boss, party of one.
Right there.

348
00:23:07.002 --> 00:23:09.013
All right.
Let's go, pookie.

349
00:23:21.022 --> 00:23:24.021
No. It can't be!

350
00:23:31.005 --> 00:23:33.010
It is! It's Marv!

351
00:23:36.005 --> 00:23:38.017
Mr. Prescott?
Mr. Prescott, are you there?

352
00:23:44.007 --> 00:23:46.021
Mr. Prescott! Help!

353
00:23:56.012 --> 00:23:59.013
(gasps)
Marv, the alarm is on.

354
00:23:59.015 --> 00:24:02.014
Oh, no.
What are we gonna do?

355
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.014
Watch this, eh?

356
00:24:07.007 --> 00:24:09.011
Oh.

357
00:24:11.002 --> 00:24:13.015
- Alarm, off.
- (beeps)

358
00:24:15.003 --> 00:24:17.013
Hmm.
Door, open.

359
00:24:17.015 --> 00:24:19.017
(buzz)

360
00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:22.021
Ahh!
That is one handy gadget.

361
00:24:22.023 --> 00:24:25.006
Well, what's my motto?

362
00:24:25.008 --> 00:24:27.022
You're the boss?

363
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.012
Be prepared.
Yeah.
Right.

364
00:24:31.023 --> 00:24:33.023
I married a genius.

365
00:24:39.002 --> 00:24:41.021
What do you think that is?
Is that a turkey ball?

366
00:24:41.023 --> 00:24:44.011
Just put that down.
Like a klepto here.
All right.

367
00:24:44.013 --> 00:24:48.002
- The prince should be staying
in one of these rooms.
- I think that's an elevator.

368
00:24:48.004 --> 00:24:50.020
Don't-- you give me
such a headache.
You give me a headache.

369
00:24:50.022 --> 00:24:53.021
You're giving me a headache.
You give me a headache.

370
00:24:53.023 --> 00:24:57.011
- MARV:
Don't push me.
- Door, close.

371
00:24:57.013 --> 00:25:00.003
(whispering)
You're driving me crazy.
You're driving me crazy.

372
00:25:00.005 --> 00:25:02.016
You're driving me--
oh, shut up.

373
00:25:02.018 --> 00:25:05.017
Door, open.

374
00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:07.008
Door, close.
I love this thing.

375
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.022
Marv--

376
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.014
The door was... shutting.

377
00:25:12.016 --> 00:25:15.000
What's wrong
with this thing?
Door, open.

378
00:25:23.012 --> 00:25:25.014
MARV (whispering):
I think there's somebody here.

379
00:25:25.016 --> 00:25:27.015
Anybody in here?

380
00:25:27.017 --> 00:25:29.016
Well, not now.
Shh!
You shh!

381
00:25:29.018 --> 00:25:32.000
You shh!
You shh!

382
00:25:33.023 --> 00:25:36.009
(water running)

383
00:25:36.011 --> 00:25:38.017
Maybe the prince came early.

384
00:25:41.003 --> 00:25:43.008
(water running)

385
00:26:01.023 --> 00:26:04.002
(raspberry)
MARV:
What the--

386
00:26:05.003 --> 00:26:07.005
(both screaming)

387
00:26:11.011 --> 00:26:13.010
(groans)

388
00:26:13.012 --> 00:26:16.003
That's it. Come on.

389
00:26:20.017 --> 00:26:22.010
(groans)
Ow!

390
00:26:25.008 --> 00:26:28.012
(groaning)

391
00:26:28.014 --> 00:26:31.000
(screaming)

392
00:26:37.017 --> 00:26:40.012
(water rushing)

393
00:26:56.016 --> 00:26:58.011
(gasping)
Up!

394
00:27:02.018 --> 00:27:05.019
- MARV:
Come on, honey.
- Uh! Marv!

395
00:27:07.008 --> 00:27:10.005
- (creaking)
- (Vera gasping)

396
00:27:10.007 --> 00:27:12.020
(screaming)

397
00:27:14.009 --> 00:27:17.001
MARV:
Ow! Ow! Ow!

398
00:27:18.016 --> 00:27:22.017
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

399
00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:25.020
(Vera gasping)

400
00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:28.017
Mr. Prescott!

401
00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:32.005
Mr. Prescott!

402
00:27:37.019 --> 00:27:41.009
- You!
- Hello, Marv.

403
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:44.018
Well, long time, no see.

404
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.015
- Huh, kid?
- Is that the prince?

405
00:27:46.017 --> 00:27:49.019
No, that's Kevin.
Kevin, Vera.
Vera, Kevin.

406
00:27:49.021 --> 00:27:52.005
If that ain't him,
let's get outta here
before somebody sees us.

407
00:27:52.007 --> 00:27:55.004
Yeah. I think we got
the lay of the land.

408
00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:58.010
I'll be back!
(yells)

409
00:27:58.012 --> 00:28:01.000
Come on!
Oh, all right!

410
00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:06.007
(tires squealing)

411
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.009
House, clean yourself up.
(buzzes)

412
00:28:31.011 --> 00:28:33.017
Well, it was worth a try.

413
00:28:33.019 --> 00:28:36.009
Okay, maybe
they won't be too mad.

414
00:28:36.011 --> 00:28:40.016
I mean, once I tell them
what happened, maybe
they'll be okay with it.

415
00:28:43.002 --> 00:28:45.020
(screams)

416
00:28:45.022 --> 00:28:48.015
Or maybe not.
What-- what--

417
00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:52.003
What-- what--

418
00:28:52.005 --> 00:28:54.006
(creaking)
What-- what--

419
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:59.004
Okay, I know
it looks bad, but--

420
00:28:59.006 --> 00:29:01.013
(screams)
Honey, what's the--

421
00:29:01.015 --> 00:29:06.018
(panting)
Kevin, what-- what--
What have you done?

422
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.010
Prescott! Prescott!

423
00:29:09.012 --> 00:29:12.001
It's not working. I tried.
Prescott:
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

424
00:29:12.003 --> 00:29:15.017
Get up here! Now!

425
00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:19.014
- Well, it wasn't working.
- Kevin, what happened?

426
00:29:19.016 --> 00:29:22.005
It wasn't me.
It was the burglars.

427
00:29:22.007 --> 00:29:25.023
- The burglars?
- Yeah. And I recognized
the one guy. Marv.

428
00:29:26.001 --> 00:29:28.012
Did I ever tell you about him?
Well, that's another story.

429
00:29:28.014 --> 00:29:31.017
But the point is
they were gonna
rip off your house.

430
00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:35.003
-So you chose instead
to trash it?
-No. I was trying to protect it.

431
00:29:35.005 --> 00:29:37.018
- By trashing it?
- What in the name of--

432
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.018
Hey, why didn't you come
when I was calling you?

433
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.017
Prescott,

434
00:29:41.019 --> 00:29:45.003
Were you aware of
any burglars here today?

435
00:29:45.005 --> 00:29:47.019
Burglars?

436
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:51.003
No, ma'am. All the alarms
were on as usual.

437
00:29:51.005 --> 00:29:53.021
Maybe they turned 'em off.
They had one of these, you know.

438
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.004
I saw no intruders,
and except for--
beg your pardon, ma'am--

439
00:29:57.006 --> 00:30:01.011
the briefest of bathroom
breaks, my eyes were on
the monitors at all times.

440
00:30:01.013 --> 00:30:05.008
How one child could do
so much damage in the time
it took me to--

441
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.014
- Well, it's quite beyond me.
- It wasn't me!

442
00:30:07.016 --> 00:30:09.014
Well, there was
no one else here.

443
00:30:09.016 --> 00:30:10.021
- He's lying!
- Am not!

444
00:30:10.023 --> 00:30:12.006
- Are too!
- Am not!

445
00:30:12.008 --> 00:30:14.020
- Are too!
- With all due respect, sir,

446
00:30:14.022 --> 00:30:17.015
I did see master Kevin
playing with the devices...

447
00:30:17.017 --> 00:30:19.023
as if the house
were a big toy.
(gasps)

448
00:30:20.001 --> 00:30:22.013
The only hooligan
here today was your son.

449
00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:25.018
(hyperventilating)
Give us a minute.

450
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.015
(hyperventilating continues)

451
00:30:28.017 --> 00:30:31.007
Kevin.

452
00:30:31.009 --> 00:30:33.017
(hyperventilating continues)

453
00:30:41.004 --> 00:30:43.002
Kevin, sit.
Dad--

454
00:30:45.012 --> 00:30:49.003
What's going on?
I told you. The burglars
broke into the house.

455
00:30:49.005 --> 00:30:53.000
Kevin, you know I can forgive
just about anything but lying.

456
00:30:53.002 --> 00:30:56.012
Oh, right. So you wouldn't get
mad if I wrecked the place,
which I didn't,

457
00:30:56.014 --> 00:30:58.010
as long as
I admit that I did,

458
00:30:58.012 --> 00:31:00.014
which I didn't?

459
00:31:01.017 --> 00:31:05.017
Well, I thought
this over and, uh,

460
00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:08.007
I understand that
this is a difficult
adjustment for you.

461
00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:11.017
And it's only natural
that you'd be acting out.
It's a need for attention.

462
00:31:11.019 --> 00:31:13.009
- No, it isn't.
- Kevin!

463
00:31:13.011 --> 00:31:17.008
Anyway--

464
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.015
Anyway,
what's a little damage?

465
00:31:20.017 --> 00:31:23.020
It's not as if
I'm not insured.

466
00:31:23.022 --> 00:31:25.021
Do you have something to say?

467
00:31:25.023 --> 00:31:29.003
Thank you.

468
00:31:29.005 --> 00:31:33.013
- And?
- I'm sorry for the damage
of your house.

469
00:32:10.014 --> 00:32:14.000
(audio rewinding)

470
00:32:14.002 --> 00:32:17.005
The security cameras
must have got
the whole thing on tape.

471
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:23.002
What?

472
00:32:23.004 --> 00:32:25.015
Prescott must have
turned off the cameras.

473
00:32:29.017 --> 00:32:32.003
MARV:
It's unbelievable.

474
00:32:32.005 --> 00:32:34.017
It is not to be believed!

475
00:32:36.003 --> 00:32:38.009
I can't believe this!

476
00:32:38.011 --> 00:32:40.011
It's the lousy kid again.

477
00:32:40.013 --> 00:32:43.013
Everywhere I break into!

478
00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:46.000
It's like he's stalking me
or something.

479
00:32:46.002 --> 00:32:47.018
Come on, Marv.
He's just a little boy.

480
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.021
Yeah, well, I got
big scars from that little--

481
00:32:52.007 --> 00:32:54.001
Never mind.

482
00:32:55.008 --> 00:32:56.017
I'll tell you one thing,

483
00:32:56.019 --> 00:32:59.016
this time he's
not gonna mess me up.

484
00:32:59.018 --> 00:33:04.008
- Mm-hmm.
- This time it's all gonna go
smooth as silk.

485
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.012
Because this time...

486
00:33:07.014 --> 00:33:09.018
I got an inside man.

487
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.022
- (chuckling)
- (chuckling)

488
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.004
Oh.
(chuckles)

489
00:33:19.017 --> 00:33:21.017
(grunts)
(tires squeal)

490
00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:24.003
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

491
00:33:24.005 --> 00:33:27.003
(horn honking)
MARV: Hey, come on!
Watch the road! Safety first.

492
00:33:55.014 --> 00:33:58.017
- (screams)
- What are you doing here?

493
00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:03.008
- Tell me.
- I, uh-- I--

494
00:34:04.016 --> 00:34:06.022
Nothing. I swear.

495
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.017
I just thought all of this was
kinda cool so I wanted
to take a look at it.

496
00:34:09.019 --> 00:34:14.009
You don't go to other people's
homes uninvited, and you don't
touch their things.

497
00:34:14.011 --> 00:34:17.015
Didn't I warn you
what would happen if I ever
caught you in here again?

498
00:34:17.017 --> 00:34:19.018
Not specifically.

499
00:34:21.013 --> 00:34:24.008
Trust me.
It won't be pleasant.

500
00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:26.023
(knocking on door)
What do you want?

501
00:34:27.001 --> 00:34:29.013
I thought I heard
the boy. Ah!

502
00:34:29.015 --> 00:34:32.001
And indeed I did.

503
00:34:32.003 --> 00:34:35.010
I don't want him bothering you
anymore, so I'll just get him
out of your way.

504
00:34:35.012 --> 00:34:37.013
Come along, Kevin.

505
00:34:40.014 --> 00:34:43.010
He'll be my responsibility
from now on.

506
00:34:50.012 --> 00:34:53.011
Thank you for
saving me, Molly.

507
00:34:53.013 --> 00:34:56.023
Prescott is a good person
to stay away from.

508
00:34:57.001 --> 00:34:59.012
You're telling me.
He's one of the bad guys--

509
00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:01.014
The bad guys who
broke into the house.

510
00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:06.016
Although technically
they didn't break in, because
they had their own remote.

511
00:35:06.018 --> 00:35:09.018
And who do you think
gave them that?
Prescott?

512
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:13.000
- Mm-hmm.
- That sounds a bit
far-fetched to me.

513
00:35:13.002 --> 00:35:16.013
I know.
And you probably think I have
an overactive imagination.

514
00:35:16.015 --> 00:35:19.020
Most people do.
But you have to believe me.

515
00:35:19.022 --> 00:35:23.021
Kevin, Prescott is a lonely man.
The only thing he has
is this job.

516
00:35:23.023 --> 00:35:26.007
And between you and me,
he hates working here.

517
00:35:26.009 --> 00:35:29.019
But to do
what you're suggesting--
Then it all makes perfect sense.

518
00:35:29.021 --> 00:35:33.013
He hates his job, so he tries
to pull off a big heist
so he can afford to quit.

519
00:35:33.015 --> 00:35:35.023
Ah, I don't know.
Listen.

520
00:35:36.001 --> 00:35:38.006
He told my dad I was lying
when I wasn't.

521
00:35:38.008 --> 00:35:42.008
And he shut off
the security cameras.
So it can only mean one thing.

522
00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.009
- And that is?
- Marv and his new friend...

523
00:35:45.011 --> 00:35:47.012
have an inside guy--

524
00:35:47.014 --> 00:35:51.001
Prescott.
I think you're right.

525
00:35:51.003 --> 00:35:55.012
- I am?
- Yeah. You do have
an overactive imagination.

526
00:35:57.012 --> 00:36:00.005
But that's what I love
about children.

527
00:36:00.007 --> 00:36:04.014
My own son was the same
as you at your age--
a real handful.

528
00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:06.017
You must have been
a great mom, Molly.

529
00:36:08.016 --> 00:36:13.010
Well, you just try to keep
that imagination
under control, okay?

530
00:36:14.023 --> 00:36:18.012
<i>(classical music on stereo)</i>

531
00:36:18.014 --> 00:36:21.013
PETER:
You were very understanding
about what happened today.

532
00:36:21.015 --> 00:36:25.008
Well, Kevin's going through
a difficult time.

533
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:27.008
It's not easy
when your parents split up.

534
00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.012
Believe me, I know.

535
00:36:29.014 --> 00:36:31.007
But we'll get through it.

536
00:36:31.009 --> 00:36:33.022
You're gonna be
a great stepmom.

537
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.013
<i>(music continues)</i>

538
00:36:36.015 --> 00:36:40.023
(exhales) I think we just need
to figure out a way to make him
feel more at home here.

539
00:36:41.001 --> 00:36:44.013
Maybe do some of the Christmas
things he's used to doing,
like trimming the tree.

540
00:36:44.015 --> 00:36:48.016
You do that yourself?
(chuckles) Yes, I do
that myself.

541
00:36:48.018 --> 00:36:52.007
It's fun. That's exactly
what we're gonna do.
We're gonna trim the tree.

542
00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:55.002
It'll get us in the spirit
of things, unite us as a family.

543
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:57.022
Okay.
Okay?

544
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.015
No friends, no fun, no snow.

545
00:37:03.017 --> 00:37:07.001
This is definitely
gonna be the worst
Christmas ever.

546
00:37:09.007 --> 00:37:11.014
Hey, Kev.
How you doing?

547
00:37:18.007 --> 00:37:20.016
(sighs)

548
00:37:20.018 --> 00:37:23.012
What do you say
we just forget about today
and start over, huh?

549
00:37:23.014 --> 00:37:26.010
You mean it?
Yeah.

550
00:37:26.012 --> 00:37:28.000
You know, Natalie's really
a great person.

551
00:37:28.002 --> 00:37:31.002
You just gotta get to
know her better.

552
00:37:31.004 --> 00:37:33.022
I think we should start having
a little more fun around here.

553
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.010
I could live with that.
Yeah?

554
00:37:36.012 --> 00:37:38.006
Why don't we start
by trimming that tree?

555
00:37:38.008 --> 00:37:39.016

Of course we'll be there.
We wouldn't miss it.

Let me call you back.
(phone beeps off)

585
00:39:09.015 --> 00:39:13.000
Evangelista's in town.
Margaret's just throwing
together a little
impromptu supper,

586
00:39:13.002 --> 00:39:15.014
but we shouldn't go,
should we?

587
00:39:15.016 --> 00:39:19.006
Well, why don't you just
go ahead without me,
and Kevin and I
will finish up over here?

588
00:39:19.008 --> 00:39:21.007
Really? You wouldn't mind?

589
00:39:21.009 --> 00:39:24.007
No. They're your friends anyway.

590
00:39:24.009 --> 00:39:27.011
You're an angel.
I won't be home late.

591
00:39:30.007 --> 00:39:32.021
Okay.

592
00:39:32.023 --> 00:39:34.021
Where were we?

593
00:39:34.023 --> 00:39:39.018
You don't have to stay
because of me.
No, I want to stay. Really.

594
00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:42.007
So, does Natalie go out
every night?

595
00:39:42.009 --> 00:39:47.000
Pretty much. She leads a very
exciting life-- more exciting
than we're used to.

596
00:39:47.002 --> 00:39:49.001
So you'd say
you're not in a rut?

597
00:39:49.003 --> 00:39:52.017
No, I'm not in a rut. Why?

598
00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:54.016
I thought maybe
that's why you left.

599
00:39:54.018 --> 00:39:57.013
Kevin. Kevin, you know--

600
00:39:59.006 --> 00:40:02.015
I didn't leave your mom
to be with Natalie, okay?

601
00:40:02.017 --> 00:40:04.013
That just kind of
happened later.

602
00:40:04.015 --> 00:40:06.000
You wanna tell me about it?

603
00:40:07.023 --> 00:40:12.005
(exhales)
Adult relationships
are just complicated.

604
00:40:12.007 --> 00:40:15.016
Sometimes when two people
get married really young
like your mom and I did,

605
00:40:15.018 --> 00:40:17.012
You just end up
feeling kind of--

606
00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:20.009
- You missed out on some things.
- Yeah.

607
00:40:20.011 --> 00:40:22.010
Just 'cause you grow up
on the outside,

608
00:40:22.012 --> 00:40:24.010
doesn't mean you wanna
stop having fun,
enjoying life.

609
00:40:24.012 --> 00:40:26.016
I know all about
the inner child, Dad.

610
00:40:26.018 --> 00:40:30.010
- Oh. You do, huh?
- That's why old guys
drive sports cars.

611
00:40:30.012 --> 00:40:32.013
You're probably right.

612
00:40:32.015 --> 00:40:36.019
But the trouble with
sports cars--
no room for anybody else.

613
00:40:36.021 --> 00:40:40.019
Maybe one other person max.
But if you want to take
a real road trip,

614
00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:43.014
with luggage and all,
you don't even have room
for a friend.

615
00:40:43.016 --> 00:40:46.005
I mean, they're
cool and fast and all,

616
00:40:46.007 --> 00:40:49.019
but who wants to be
in a nice car when
you're all alone?

617
00:41:03.006 --> 00:41:06.001
(Kate sighs)

618
00:41:06.003 --> 00:41:09.015
Well, that looks
just about perfect.

619
00:41:09.017 --> 00:41:12.011
All that's left to do now
is put on the star.

620
00:41:12.013 --> 00:41:14.015
Kevin always puts on the star.

621
00:41:14.017 --> 00:41:16.015
That's right.
He does, doesn't he?

622
00:41:16.017 --> 00:41:19.009
I always hold him up.
And then I give him a wedgie.

623
00:41:19.011 --> 00:41:24.007
(chuckles) He makes a fuss.
We all laugh.

624
00:41:24.009 --> 00:41:27.012
Well, I guess
we're just gonna have to
use the ladder this year.

625
00:41:29.023 --> 00:41:32.018
Okay, Dad, you can
put me down now.

626
00:41:34.003 --> 00:41:36.019
Wow. Looks pretty good.

627
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:39.001
I think it looks great.

628
00:41:39.003 --> 00:41:41.012
I think it's
our best tree yet.

629
00:41:44.004 --> 00:41:46.010
PETER (on tv): <i>Hey!</i>

630
00:41:46.012 --> 00:41:48.013

631
00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:53.015
- <i>Merry Christmas, Mommy.</i>

632
00:41:53.017 --> 00:41:57.004
KATE (on tv): <i>Merry Christmas.</i>

00:41:57.006 --> 00:42:00.013

636
00:42:06.019 --> 00:42:09.007

<i>to make some breakfast.</i>

637
00:42:16.012 --> 00:42:18.021
(yawns) Morning.
Mornin'.

638
00:42:24.015 --> 00:42:27.009
Good morning, sleepyheads.
You're finally up.

639
00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:29.009
What did you do
to our tree?

640
00:42:29.011 --> 00:42:31.006
Oh, that's my fault.

641
00:42:31.008 --> 00:42:33.008
I have a standing appointment
with the tree decorators
every year.

642
00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.014
And in all the excitement,
I forgot to cancel.

643
00:42:36.016 --> 00:42:38.015
Are you ever
gonna forgive me?

644
00:42:38.017 --> 00:42:41.004
You undid our tree?

645
00:42:41.006 --> 00:42:44.021
Well, it would have
had to come down
eventually anyway.

646
00:42:44.023 --> 00:42:47.011
Yeah, come on, Kev.
Look at all these presents, huh?

647
00:42:47.013 --> 00:42:50.010
Oh, wait.
Ooh, here's a big one.
I believe it has--

648
00:42:50.012 --> 00:42:52.013
yes, it has
your name on it.

649
00:42:52.015 --> 00:42:55.011
Come on. Let's open it up.
It's from Natalie and me.

650
00:42:55.013 --> 00:42:58.007
But shouldn't I open it
tomorrow on Christmas?

651
00:42:58.009 --> 00:43:01.016
Ah, you got plenty
to open tomorrow.
Come on. One won't hurt.

652
00:43:01.018 --> 00:43:04.007
Go ahead.

653
00:43:04.009 --> 00:43:07.002
(gasps)
Super spy bugging
and listening device.

654
00:43:07.004 --> 00:43:11.023
Isn't that cool?
Yeah. Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Natalie.

655
00:43:12.001 --> 00:43:14.018
I'm glad you like it.

656
00:43:20.013 --> 00:43:23.015
- Hey, Mom, where are you going?
- I'm going to take Kevin
some things.

657
00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:26.018
- Mom, where you going?
- He doesn't have
any clean clothes with him,

658
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.006
and I'm sure
he doesn't have
any toys to play with.

659
00:43:31.006 --> 00:43:34.007
To check out Dad's girlfriend.
Wanna go?

660
00:43:35.018 --> 00:43:37.021
(doorbell rings)

661
00:43:41.002 --> 00:43:43.001
May I help you?

662
00:43:43.003 --> 00:43:45.002
Wow!
I'm here for
Kevin McCallister.

663
00:43:45.004 --> 00:43:46.020
Wow!
Buzz.

664
00:43:46.022 --> 00:43:49.017
- Are you here to take him home?
- No, I have something for him.

665
00:43:50.021 --> 00:43:53.009
Right this way.

666
00:43:53.011 --> 00:43:55.003
PETER:
You should be able to hear that.

667
00:43:55.005 --> 00:43:57.017
How do I sound?
KATE (on headset):
<i>Kids, stay close.</i>

668
00:43:58.023 --> 00:44:01.009
Mom!
Hey!

669
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:03.023
Hey!

670
00:44:04.001 --> 00:44:07.011
Mmm! Ohh!

671
00:44:07.013 --> 00:44:10.007
- (chuckles)
- Hey, you guys remember
Natalie, right?

672
00:44:10.009 --> 00:44:11.023
Buzz, Megan.
Hi, Natalie.

673
00:44:12.001 --> 00:44:15.015
Oh, and, uh,
Kate, this is Natalie.

674
00:44:15.017 --> 00:44:18.003
Natalie, Kate.
Hello, Kate.

675
00:44:18.005 --> 00:44:20.009
Hello.

676
00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:23.007
So, are you guys gonna stay?

677
00:44:23.009 --> 00:44:27.015
No, I just brought you
some of your stuff.
You guys gotta see this house.

678
00:44:27.017 --> 00:44:31.005
- Is that okay, Natalie?
- Of course. Be my guest.

679
00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:35.012
Awesome tree!
It used to look better.

680
00:44:35.014 --> 00:44:37.015
Wait, what is this thing
on your head?

681
00:44:37.017 --> 00:44:40.008
It's a spy kit that Natalie
got me for an early
Christmas present.

682
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:43.001
Really?
That was nice of you.

683
00:44:43.003 --> 00:44:45.010
Well, I'm very fond
of your kids.

684
00:44:45.012 --> 00:44:47.020
I've gotta show you
this airplane that she got me.

685
00:44:52.013 --> 00:44:54.010
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

686
00:44:54.012 --> 00:44:56.016
Oh, no, thank you.

687
00:44:56.018 --> 00:45:01.004
I, uh, didn't know he would have
all this stuff to play with.
Yeah.

688
00:45:02.007 --> 00:45:04.006
Oh, god. Hey.
Let me get that.

689
00:45:04.008 --> 00:45:06.016
I wasn't even sure he could
even sleep without it.

690
00:45:06.018 --> 00:45:08.004
Gosh, you know what?

691
00:45:08.006 --> 00:45:09.021
I cannot believe
he hasn't even asked for it.

692
00:45:09.023 --> 00:45:12.006
Well, we could buy him
another stuffed animal.

693
00:45:12.008 --> 00:45:14.003
Oh, no, no.
No.

694
00:45:14.005 --> 00:45:16.002
This is, uh, is Teddy.

695
00:45:16.004 --> 00:45:18.008
Teddy is his
transitional object.

696
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:21.013
Yeah.
Transitional object.

697
00:45:21.015 --> 00:45:25.018
It's like something very,
very special a child carries
with him everywhere.

698
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.022
You're actually supposed to have
a spare, in case something
happens to it.

699
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.018
Of course,
we only had one, remember?
Oh! How could I forget?

700
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.023
We were driving down
the highway,

701
00:45:35.001 --> 00:45:36.023
like, really in a hurry,
going somewhere,

702
00:45:37.001 --> 00:45:39.019
of course, Kevin thinks,
oh possibly Teddy might
want a little fresh air.

703
00:45:39.021 --> 00:45:42.013
So he rolls down the window
and out flies Teddy!

704
00:45:42.015 --> 00:45:45.014
He was ballistic.
He was crying.
He was so upset.

705
00:45:45.016 --> 00:45:47.012
It was-- oh, my--

706
00:45:47.014 --> 00:45:50.010
So Peter pulls over,
and I get out
to retrieve the bear.

707
00:45:50.012 --> 00:45:53.001
- I still can't
believe you did that.
- (chuckles)

708
00:45:53.003 --> 00:45:56.000
Well, it was the slow lane,
and there wasn't much traffic.

709
00:45:56.002 --> 00:45:59.011
Yeah, well, I don't know
what he would have done
if he had lost it.

710
00:46:04.002 --> 00:46:07.002
Well, I think Kevin's going to
have so much fun playing
with the prince...

711
00:46:07.004 --> 00:46:09.010
that he's not even gonna
miss the stuffed animal.

712
00:46:09.012 --> 00:46:13.008
It's going to be so wonderful
having a house full of children.
I'm looking forward to it.

713
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:16.003
Children, watch
the garden sculpture!

714
00:46:16.005 --> 00:46:20.000
Well, I... better get going.

715
00:46:25.016 --> 00:46:28.002
Before they break something.

716
00:46:33.018 --> 00:46:36.014
Well, we're off to the airport
to pick up the royal family.

717
00:46:36.016 --> 00:46:39.001
You all know
how important this is.

718
00:46:39.003 --> 00:46:41.004
Now, the caterers
will be here momentarily.

719
00:46:41.006 --> 00:46:43.012
And the guests will arrive
about an hour before...

720
00:46:43.014 --> 00:46:46.020
you and the royals
make your grand entrance.
MOLLY: No need to worry, ma'am.

721
00:46:46.022 --> 00:46:49.011
Everything will be
taken care of.

722
00:46:49.013 --> 00:46:53.008
It's just that I want
everything to go right.
Come on. Let's not be late.

723
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:56.022
I don't want one
single thing to go wrong.
Door, open.

724
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.018
And nothing will.

725
00:47:03.001 --> 00:47:06.005
(people chattering)

726
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:33.000
(knocking on door)

727
00:47:38.012 --> 00:47:40.015
Prescott:
Oh, good.
You've finally arrived.

728
00:47:54.022 --> 00:47:58.010
- Mr. Prescott!
Mr. Prescott! It's them!
- Hush, you.

729
00:47:58.012 --> 00:48:00.015
I'll get him
out of your way.
Thank you.

730
00:48:00.017 --> 00:48:04.002
It's the burglars!
It's the burglars!
Aah! Mr. Prescott!

731
00:48:04.004 --> 00:48:06.019
KEVIN (yelling):
it's Marv!

732
00:48:06.021 --> 00:48:09.000
I guess you already
knew that though.

733
00:48:09.002 --> 00:48:13.021
Listen, you.
I have just about had enough
of you and your melodrama!

734
00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:17.023
This is a very important night,
and if I have to lock you up
to keep you out of our way,

735
00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:19.021
don't think I won't do it.
Look!

736
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.006
Ow!

737
00:48:23.008 --> 00:48:26.017
Ow! Ow!

738
00:48:26.019 --> 00:48:30.002
Don't trifle with me,
you demon spawn!

739
00:48:32.016 --> 00:48:36.023
Now that's
a foolish place to hide.
(groans)

740
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.005
One down, two to go.

741
00:48:51.007 --> 00:48:53.015
(muffled) Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

742
00:48:53.017 --> 00:48:55.021
It's freezing cold!
Let me out!

743
00:49:11.005 --> 00:49:14.007
Kevin, have you seen Prescott?

744
00:49:14.009 --> 00:49:16.012
Not lately.
Ah, typical.

745
00:49:16.014 --> 00:49:18.013
Always poking around
when you don't want him,

746
00:49:18.015 --> 00:49:21.015
and when you need him--
nowhere to be found.
(doorbell rings)

747
00:49:21.017 --> 00:49:26.006
Ah! Guests already?
Whatever happened
to fashionably late?

748
00:49:29.012 --> 00:49:31.022
NATALIE:
Well, I don't like
to boast, but,

749
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.018
yes, it will be
the party of the season.
(beep)

750
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:39.006
Oh, I'm getting another call.
All right. See you there.

751
00:49:39.008 --> 00:49:43.023
Hello? Carmelina,
how are you?
(mouthing words)

752
00:49:45.008 --> 00:49:47.018
What? Oh, no!

753
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:51.012
They're snowed in.
Their flight's been canceled.

754
00:49:51.014 --> 00:49:54.002
Well, so am I. Devastated.

755
00:49:54.004 --> 00:49:56.021
Well, all right.
We'll see you tomorrow.

756
00:49:56.023 --> 00:49:58.019
Merry Christmas.

757
00:49:58.021 --> 00:50:01.010
(phone beeps off)

758
00:50:01.012 --> 00:50:04.023
What are we gonna do now?
It's gonna be just
an ordinary party.

759
00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:09.021
Christmas Eve at your place
sounds anything
but ordinary to me.

760
00:50:09.023 --> 00:50:12.001
It's hardly the party
of the season.

761
00:50:14.006 --> 00:50:16.016
Peter.

762
00:50:16.018 --> 00:50:21.006
- What if we announce
our engagement tonight?
- Tonight?

763
00:50:21.008 --> 00:50:23.023
I know we were
gonna wait till after
your divorce was final,

764
00:50:24.001 --> 00:50:27.005
but it's only a few weeks away
and your kids already know,

765
00:50:27.007 --> 00:50:29.016
and it'll make tonight
so special.

766
00:50:29.018 --> 00:50:31.018
Well, if it makes you happy.

767
00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:34.000
Yes!

768
00:50:35.013 --> 00:50:37.015
(chuckles)

769
00:50:40.001 --> 00:50:42.001
Where are those guys?

770
00:50:42.003 --> 00:50:46.008
Marv, I gotta tinkle.
Vera, you can
tinkle next week.

771
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.008
MARV (on headset):
<i>Always in a hurry.</i>

772
00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:50.021
Door, open.

773
00:50:55.009 --> 00:50:57.013
All right.
Now, you remember the plan?

774
00:50:57.015 --> 00:51:00.013
Which plan? Harry's plan?
What-- no!
Not harry's plan!

775
00:51:00.015 --> 00:51:03.010
The one involving
rope and a bag!
Why are you yelling at me?

776
00:51:03.012 --> 00:51:05.007
I'm not yell--

777
00:51:05.009 --> 00:51:07.018
Do you remember
the plan?
Yeah.

778
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:10.022
Now, when the prince
comes up to bed--
We bag him!

779
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.014
- That's right.
We kidnap the kid napping.
- You're a genius, Marv.

780
00:51:15.016 --> 00:51:19.001
That's right.
Door, open.

781
00:51:19.003 --> 00:51:22.006
Now, the prince goes
in the bag.

782
00:51:22.008 --> 00:51:26.003
The bag goes out the window.
Uh-huh.

783
00:51:26.005 --> 00:51:29.004
We climb down the rope.
<i>Door, close.</i>

784
00:51:29.006 --> 00:51:30.016
Right.

785
00:51:30.018 --> 00:51:33.017
MARV (on headset):
<i>Everybody in the van.</i>

786
00:51:36.003 --> 00:51:38.023
And we're gone before
they know what hit 'em.

787
00:51:39.001 --> 00:51:43.002
Beautiful plan, Marv.
Elegant in its simplicity.

788
00:51:43.004 --> 00:51:47.008
All right.
Let's try it out.
Get in the bag.

789
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:49.005
Me? Why don't you
get in the bag?

790
00:51:49.007 --> 00:51:51.015
Because I'm the boss.
Get in the bag, Vera.

791
00:51:51.017 --> 00:51:54.017
- I don't wanna get in the bag.
- Vera, just get in the bag!
Please!

792
00:51:54.019 --> 00:51:57.005
You didn't tell me
I was gonna get in no bag.

793
00:51:57.007 --> 00:51:59.023
I was saving it.
It's gonna be fun.
Ooh, we're in the bag!

794
00:52:00.001 --> 00:52:02.000
- (grunting)
- (groaning)

795
00:52:02.002 --> 00:52:04.017
Nice. All right.

796
00:52:04.019 --> 00:52:07.018
Window, open.

797
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.022
Ahh.
(grunts)

798
00:52:13.003 --> 00:52:15.017
VERA:
Uh, Marv. Ooh. Oh.

799
00:52:15.019 --> 00:52:19.008
(grunts)
Don't worry, honey.
I got ya.

800
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.021
Marv! Let me down easy.

801
00:52:21.023 --> 00:52:25.009
I always do, baby.
(straining)

802
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:27.016
Shouldn't have had
that last piece of cake.

803
00:52:27.018 --> 00:52:30.006
(yelps)

804
00:52:30.008 --> 00:52:32.018
(rope creaking)

805
00:52:34.012 --> 00:52:37.006
- Perfect.
- Door, open.

806
00:52:39.005 --> 00:52:40.019
(screams)

807
00:52:42.023 --> 00:52:45.015
- (groans)
- Don't worry.

808
00:52:45.017 --> 00:52:47.016
Everything's under control.

809
00:52:47.018 --> 00:52:49.020
Uh, uh, Marv--

810
00:52:51.005 --> 00:52:53.010
(screaming)

811
00:52:53.012 --> 00:52:55.008
- (thud)
- Easy...

812
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:58.000
but still way cool.

813
00:53:02.008 --> 00:53:04.002
(Marv groaning)

814
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.007
Thanks for breaking
my fall, pumpkin.

815
00:53:08.009 --> 00:53:10.020
(hoarse voice)
I always do, baby. Okay.

816
00:53:10.022 --> 00:53:12.022
Get out and stay out!

817
00:53:19.006 --> 00:53:22.021
- I know what
you're trying to do.
- Oh, yeah, wise guy? What?

818
00:53:22.023 --> 00:53:26.009
You're trying to
kidnap the prince.

819
00:53:29.011 --> 00:53:32.012
Shut up,
ya little moron!

820
00:53:34.012 --> 00:53:37.001
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Okay.

821
00:53:37.003 --> 00:53:39.005
(chuckling)

822
00:53:44.003 --> 00:53:46.006
(raspberry)

823
00:53:49.007 --> 00:53:53.002
Vera, honey.
Little help?

824
00:53:53.004 --> 00:53:55.022
Oh, yeah, baby.
That'd be great.
I sure could use it.

825
00:54:03.015 --> 00:54:06.016
- <i>(Marv groaning on headset)</i>
- I got every word.

826
00:54:07.018 --> 00:54:09.014
(imitates cheer)

827
00:54:09.016 --> 00:54:12.009
<i>(classical music on stereo)</i>

828
00:54:12.011 --> 00:54:15.018
Welcome back.
Where's the royal family?
They were snowed in.

829
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.013
Ah!
Where's Prescott?

830
00:54:17.015 --> 00:54:20.017
I can't find him anywhere.
That's odd.

831
00:54:20.019 --> 00:54:24.014
Well, Molly, make sure
everyone has champagne.

832
00:54:24.016 --> 00:54:27.006
We're going to make
a special announcement.
Yes, ma'am.

833
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.003
How are you?
Hi, how are you?
Good to see you again.

834
00:54:44.019 --> 00:54:46.016
Everyone, may I have
your attention?

835
00:54:46.018 --> 00:54:48.015
Huh?

836
00:54:50.007 --> 00:54:53.008
I am gonna kill that--

837
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.019
Uuh!

838
00:55:07.022 --> 00:55:10.013
- (clattering)
- (screaming)

839
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.021
This is always a special night,
and tonight may be
even more special.

840
00:55:19.016 --> 00:55:20.023
(seething)
Get him!

841
00:55:23.004 --> 00:55:25.023
- Peter and I are engaged!
- (crowd exclaiming)

842
00:55:28.016 --> 00:55:31.012
(screams, shouts)

843
00:55:42.008 --> 00:55:45.005
- (teeth chattering)
- Prescott?

844
00:55:45.007 --> 00:55:48.014
- (softly moaning)
- This could not be goin' worse.

845
00:55:48.016 --> 00:55:51.011
Marv, you're on fire.

846
00:55:51.013 --> 00:55:53.018
Oh, thanks, baby.
You're not so bad yourself.

847
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:56.019
No, sweetheart.
You're really on fire.

848
00:55:56.021 --> 00:55:59.019
Well, I try to work out.
You know-- Aah!

849
00:55:59.021 --> 00:56:02.005
<i>Gaah! Aah!</i>

850
00:56:02.007 --> 00:56:06.020
- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
- Kevin!

851
00:56:11.012 --> 00:56:14.016
I'm not lying.
The bad guys are back.

852
00:56:14.018 --> 00:56:16.017
We're not getting anywhere.

853
00:56:18.008 --> 00:56:22.009
Kevin, I spoke to
all the caterers and to Molly.

854
00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:27.001
Nobody saw a thing but you.
Now, how could that be?

855
00:56:27.003 --> 00:56:29.023
I don't know.
But I heard they're gonna
kidnap the prince.

856
00:56:30.001 --> 00:56:34.006
- You heard them say that?
- Yeah, with my
super spy bugging device.

857
00:56:34.008 --> 00:56:37.020
- And Prescott's involved
with the whole thing.
- This is absurd.

858
00:56:37.022 --> 00:56:42.001
I'm going to call and make sure
the royal family's flight
is okay for tomorrow.

859
00:56:44.005 --> 00:56:46.009
Kevin, I know
what's going on here.

860
00:56:46.011 --> 00:56:48.021
You do?
Yeah.

861
00:56:48.023 --> 00:56:53.006
You're out to destroy
my relationship with Natalie.
What?

862
00:56:53.008 --> 00:56:57.000
You knew how important tonight
was to her, and you went and
pulled a crazy stunt like this.

863
00:56:57.002 --> 00:56:59.005
- That's not the truth.
- I've given you
a lot of leeway,

864
00:56:59.007 --> 00:57:02.016
because I know how tough
this divorce has been on you.

865
00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:05.023
But tonight you went
way too far.

866
00:57:06.001 --> 00:57:08.013
I want you to go to your room
and think about
what you've done.

867
00:57:11.014 --> 00:57:14.015
And when you're ready
to apologize to Natalie,
then we'll talk.

868
00:57:19.017 --> 00:57:22.000
Door, close.

869
00:57:34.019 --> 00:57:38.012
<i>Here you are, George!</i>
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>
(woman crying)

870
00:57:41.019 --> 00:57:44.001
(ringing)

871
00:57:48.004 --> 00:57:51.001
- Hello?
- Mom?

872
00:57:51.003 --> 00:57:54.019
Kevin! Oh, Kevin.
I'm so glad you called.

873
00:57:54.021 --> 00:57:57.015
Are you okay?

874
00:57:57.017 --> 00:58:01.002
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just watching
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

875
00:58:01.004 --> 00:58:04.012
- You are?
- You know how that gets to me.

876
00:58:04.014 --> 00:58:06.015
- What channel is it on?
- Eight.

877
00:58:12.023 --> 00:58:15.017
Ohh.

878
00:58:15.019 --> 00:58:18.003
I guess I'm just a sucker
for happy endings.

879
00:58:20.013 --> 00:58:23.006
So, how is your party?
Are you havin' a good time?

880
00:58:23.008 --> 00:58:27.013
Yeah, it's all right.
How about you?
Havin' a good Christmas Eve?

881
00:58:32.001 --> 00:58:35.000
Yeah. It's great.

882
00:58:35.002 --> 00:58:37.011
(sniffles)

883
00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:41.005
- (sobs)
I love you, Kevin.
- Love you too, Mom.

884
00:58:41.007 --> 00:58:43.019
(laughs)
Merry Christmas.

885
00:58:43.021 --> 00:58:47.011
- Merry Christmas.
- Okay. Bye.

886
00:58:48.013 --> 00:58:50.015
(beeps off)

887
00:58:52.013 --> 00:58:54.010
(beeps off)

888
00:58:54.012 --> 00:58:56.014
(crying)

889
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:04.021
(knocking)

890
00:59:04.023 --> 00:59:08.002
- Kevin, are you awake?
- Yeah.

891
00:59:12.014 --> 00:59:15.001
Your father and I were
a little rough on you before.
Are you okay?

892
00:59:15.003 --> 00:59:18.005
- Yeah.
- Good.

893
00:59:18.007 --> 00:59:21.005
Because if you ever do anything
like that again, you'll be
out of this house so fast...

894
00:59:21.007 --> 00:59:23.006
your head will spin.

895
00:59:23.008 --> 00:59:27.008
So your father's
getting divorced. Boo-hoo.
Everyone's parents get divorced.

896
00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:31.002
That's life. You'll get over it.
But you're not gonna come
between your father and me.

897
00:59:31.004 --> 00:59:35.001
He wants you in his life,
and I think that's admirable.

898
00:59:35.003 --> 00:59:39.008
But if you want
him in your life,
you better not cross me.

899
00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:44.005
Understood? Good.

900
00:59:47.018 --> 00:59:51.017
I'll have that window fixed
first thing in the morning.
Sweet dreams.

901
00:59:56.006 --> 00:59:59.006
MAN (on tv):
<i>To my big brother George,</i>
<i>the richest man in town.</i>

902
00:59:59.008 --> 01:00:02.010
<i>(crowd exclaiming)</i>

903
01:00:04.004 --> 01:00:07.009
I've just had
a nice little chat with Kevin.

904
01:00:07.011 --> 01:00:08.022
I think we're beginning
to understand
each other better.

905
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.020
What are you watching?

906
01:00:11.022 --> 01:00:14.001
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>
They've been running it
all night.

907
01:00:14.003 --> 01:00:16.008
- Come on. Watch it with me.
- I've seen it.

908
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:19.014
- So?
- So...

909
01:00:19.016 --> 01:00:23.002
I don't understand people
who watch movies
over and over again.

910
01:00:23.004 --> 01:00:25.022
I saw it. I cried.
Once was enough.

911
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.006
You gotta be kidding.
Kate and I watch this
every year with the kids.

912
01:00:29.008 --> 01:00:31.012
It's a family tradition.

913
01:00:31.014 --> 01:00:34.006
Well.
(clicks off)

914
01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:38.022
Now that you're going to have
a new family, maybe it's time
for some new traditions.

915
01:00:48.005 --> 01:00:51.008
They'll be back.
And if no one believes me,

916
01:00:51.010 --> 01:00:54.004
I'll have to catch 'em myself.
(grunts)

917
01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.018
MARV:
<i>Shut up, you little moron.</i>

918
01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.017
(clicks off)

919
01:01:19.019 --> 01:01:21.018
(keyboard clacking)

920
01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:24.022
<i>Shut up, you moron.</i>

921
01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:31.009
- Okay, stop.
- (beeps)

922
01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:33.019
(electronic voice)
<i>Spin faster.</i>

923
01:01:33.021 --> 01:01:36.018
(keyboard clacking)

924
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:41.002
MARV:
<i>Get in the bag.</i>
<i>Shut up, ya bag!</i>

925
01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:57.010
Christmas morning.
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

926
01:01:57.012 --> 01:02:00.001
Merry Christmas, Dad!
Hey, hey!

927
01:02:00.003 --> 01:02:04.008
- Peter, are you ready to go?
- Go? Go where?

928
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:09.003
Kevin, Natalie and I
gotta go pick up
the royal family right now.

929
01:02:09.005 --> 01:02:12.017
Now? But aren't we
gonna open presents?

930
01:02:12.019 --> 01:02:15.004
It's gonna have to wait
till we get back.

931
01:02:15.006 --> 01:02:18.017
But it's Christmas.
And why do you both
have to go?

932
01:02:18.019 --> 01:02:22.005
Look, you know how sometimes
you gotta do things
you don't wanna do?

933
01:02:22.007 --> 01:02:25.021
This is one of those times.
Hey, we'll be back before
you know it, okay?

934
01:02:25.023 --> 01:02:28.004
And I'm sure nothing will
happen while we're gone.
Am I right?

935
01:02:28.006 --> 01:02:30.008
- Right.
- Good.

936
01:02:31.019 --> 01:02:35.007
Hang in there.
We won't be long.

937
01:02:35.009 --> 01:02:38.003
Door, open.
(door opens)

938
01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:43.003
NATALIE:
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

939
01:02:46.005 --> 01:02:48.003
(door shuts)

940
01:02:48.005 --> 01:02:50.008
Merry Christmas.

941
01:02:51.007 --> 01:02:53.013
(cell phone rings)

942
01:02:53.015 --> 01:02:56.017
(ringing continues)

943
01:03:02.015 --> 01:03:04.019
- (sighs)
- (beeps on)

944
01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:06.022
Hello?

945
01:03:09.013 --> 01:03:12.000
No, we're awake.
It wasn't me!

946
01:03:12.002 --> 01:03:15.005
Shh! All right.
We're on our way.

947
01:03:15.007 --> 01:03:18.015
(beeps off)
Oy.
Sure makes me nervous.

948
01:03:18.017 --> 01:03:20.023
Let's go, pookie.

949
01:03:25.023 --> 01:03:28.023
I knew it. Here they come.

950
01:03:38.016 --> 01:03:43.014
First step--
eliminate the inside man.
Oh, Mr. Prescott?

951
01:03:43.016 --> 01:03:46.006
Mr. Prescott,
are you in there?
(pounding)

952
01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.020
Yes.
Mr. Prescott,

953
01:03:49.022 --> 01:03:52.014
can you help me
with something?
And what would that be?

954
01:03:52.016 --> 01:03:55.011
Another milk shake,
perhaps?
No. A bottle of wine.

955
01:03:55.013 --> 01:03:58.015
Excuse me?
Natalie said we need to get
some wine from the basement...

956
01:03:58.017 --> 01:04:01.002
for the royal family.

957
01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:04.014
If we must.

958
01:04:05.016 --> 01:04:07.022
So I guess you're right.

959
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.019
We're not gonna have
any snow this Christmas.

960
01:04:09.021 --> 01:04:13.023
One can never go wrong
with low expectations.

961
01:04:14.001 --> 01:04:18.003
You know, Mr. Prescott,
it's been great spending time
with you these last few days.

962
01:04:18.005 --> 01:04:20.014
Time flies when
you're having fun.

963
01:04:20.016 --> 01:04:25.021
I know we got off to
a bad start, but things
can be better-- much better.

964
01:04:27.019 --> 01:04:31.021
- 'Cause you're down there,
and I'm up here.
- Come get--

965
01:04:31.023 --> 01:04:34.002
(pounding)
Young man, open this door!
Let me out of here!

966
01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:37.007
Oh!
Oh, boy!
Am I glad to see you!

967
01:04:37.009 --> 01:04:40.014
The kidnappers are coming.
But this time I'm one step
ahead of them.

968
01:04:40.016 --> 01:04:43.021
And I locked their accomplice
in the basement. Is this
a perfect plan, or what?

969
01:04:43.023 --> 01:04:46.003
It would be, dear,
except for one thing--

970
01:04:46.005 --> 01:04:48.023
Prescott is not
their accomplice.

971
01:04:52.001 --> 01:04:54.005
I am.

972
01:04:54.007 --> 01:04:59.003
(gasps)
You're--
you're the inside man?

973
01:04:59.005 --> 01:05:02.011
- I'm afraid so.
- Hey, Mom.

974
01:05:04.012 --> 01:05:08.008
We're here.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

975
01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:14.009
- Mom? He's your son?
- I told you he was a handful.

976
01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:17.006
Aah! Hey!
Get off of me!
Oh, now, come on!

977
01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:23.005
Isn't there a trapdoor
or something?

978
01:05:23.007 --> 01:05:28.004
No. Not much demand for 'em
in a wine cellar.

979
01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:32.004
Guess you're right.

980
01:05:32.006 --> 01:05:34.018
Got any good ideas?

981
01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:38.004
Not a one.

982
01:05:40.015 --> 01:05:42.018
(sighs)

983
01:05:44.022 --> 01:05:49.001
I do have a cell phone though.
Perfect! May I?

984
01:05:49.003 --> 01:05:51.004
Sure.
Thanks.

985
01:05:51.006 --> 01:05:53.009
(beeping)

986
01:05:53.011 --> 01:05:56.016
(ringing, beeps on)

987
01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:59.001
Hello, Buzz?
Kevin, is that you?

988
01:05:59.003 --> 01:06:01.016
- Yeah. I'm calling
from a cell phone.
- Oh, a cell phone.

989
01:06:01.018 --> 01:06:05.015
Good for you, puke-face.
Is that another present
she gave you? What a showoff.

990
01:06:05.017 --> 01:06:07.017
(beeps off)

991
01:06:07.019 --> 01:06:10.019
- I'll try again.
- (keypad beeping)

992
01:06:12.005 --> 01:06:14.017
(ringing, beeps on)

993
01:06:14.019 --> 01:06:18.017
Buzz, before you hang up,
I need to tell you something.
I need to talk to Mom.

994
01:06:18.019 --> 01:06:21.018
Okay. You told me.
(beeps off)

995
01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.007
(beeps off)
I'll try again later.

996
01:06:25.007 --> 01:06:27.009
(sighs)

997
01:06:29.014 --> 01:06:32.008
Why in heaven's name did you
think I was the inside man?

998
01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:36.021
Well, if you hadn't acted
so strange, I wouldn't have
thought you were...

999
01:06:36.023 --> 01:06:39.006
so strange.

1000
01:06:39.008 --> 01:06:41.017
And where were you
the first time
these guys broke in?

1001
01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:43.016
Why didn't you answer
the intercom?

1002
01:06:43.018 --> 01:06:46.001
Why did you
shut off the cameras?

1003
01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:48.020
I didn't. But if those thugs
were using Molly's remote,

1004
01:06:48.022 --> 01:06:51.005
they could've turned off
the whole security system.

1005
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:55.010
- But why'd you say I was lying?
- Well, because I thought
you were.

1006
01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:58.014
And besides, I didn't
want Miss Natalie to know
that I'd been,

1007
01:06:58.016 --> 01:07:01.000
well, napping on the job.

1008
01:07:01.002 --> 01:07:04.015
That woman.
If she could work me
24 hours a day, she would.

1009
01:07:04.017 --> 01:07:08.012
It's downright inhuman.
So, whenever she's not here,
I, uh--

1010
01:07:08.014 --> 01:07:11.022
You take advantage.
I take a break.

1011
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.014
A nice, well-deserved break.

1012
01:07:14.016 --> 01:07:17.014
With all the cameras
and intercoms turned off,
I didn't notice anything.

1013
01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:20.020
- So I--
- You were covering
your whoo-hoo!

1014
01:07:20.022 --> 01:07:23.012
(chuckles) Precisely.

1015
01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:28.004
You want to try
calling your mom again?
Sure.

1016
01:07:28.006 --> 01:07:31.002
(ringing)

1017
01:07:31.004 --> 01:07:32.020
- Hello?
- Mom?

1018
01:07:32.022 --> 01:07:35.019
Kevin!
(static)

1019
01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:39.014
- Wait. Kevin, I can't hear you.
- That's probably 'cause
I'm locked in a wine cellar.

1020
01:07:39.016 --> 01:07:42.008
No, I-- honey, I can't hear you.
There's too much static.

1021
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:44.018
(yelling) I'm locked in
Natalie's wine cellar!

1022
01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:47.002
- Are you calling to say
Merry Christmas?
- Mom, are you there?

1023
01:07:47.004 --> 01:07:48.020
- Sweetheart?
- Are you there, Mom?

1024
01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:51.004
- Kevin?
- Mom? Mom?

1025
01:07:51.006 --> 01:07:53.005
(beeps off)

1026
01:07:53.007 --> 01:07:56.000
Oh, great!

1027
01:07:56.002 --> 01:07:57.018
The battery's dead.

1028
01:07:59.009 --> 01:08:01.007
(sighs)

1029
01:08:01.009 --> 01:08:03.010
Hmm.

1030
01:08:08.018 --> 01:08:11.012
(ringing)

1031
01:08:11.014 --> 01:08:14.000
- (beeps on)
- Kalban residence.

1032
01:08:14.002 --> 01:08:17.014
Hi, this is Kate McCallister,
Kevin's mom.
May I speak to him, please?

1033
01:08:17.016 --> 01:08:22.022
Kevin's not here right now.
That's strange.
He just called.

1034
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.015
Really? Well, he's out with
his father and Miss Natalie.

1035
01:08:28.017 --> 01:08:32.012
Oh. Oh, he must have called
from his dad's cell phone. That
explains the line going dead.

1036
01:08:32.014 --> 01:08:34.013
Okay. Thank you.

1037
01:08:34.015 --> 01:08:36.013
(clicks, dial tone)

1038
01:08:36.015 --> 01:08:38.017
(beeps off)

1039
01:08:44.013 --> 01:08:47.012
Little rascal
called his mother.

1040
01:08:47.014 --> 01:08:50.020
You want me to go
show him who's boss?
Sit down, Marv.

1041
01:08:50.022 --> 01:08:53.003
You're not the boss.
I'm the boss.

1042
01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:55.023
Okay.

1043
01:08:56.001 --> 01:08:59.005
(mouthing words)

1044
01:08:59.007 --> 01:09:03.003
His cell phone is dead.
I don't think he'll be
any more trouble.

1045
01:09:11.008 --> 01:09:13.010
No.

1046
01:09:14.009 --> 01:09:16.015
Cookie.

1047
01:09:16.017 --> 01:09:18.019
- (cell phone rings)
- Oh!

1048
01:09:20.006 --> 01:09:22.011
- (beeps on)
- Hello?

1049
01:09:22.013 --> 01:09:25.006
Peter, it's me.
I'm calling Kevin back.
We got disconnected.

1050
01:09:25.008 --> 01:09:27.023
Kevin?
Kevin's not with me.
He's back at Natalie's house.

1051
01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:31.005
Really? I was just told
he's with you.

1052
01:09:31.007 --> 01:09:34.015
Well-- well, don't worry, Kate.
I'm sure everything's fine.

1053
01:09:35.019 --> 01:09:38.010
Okay.

1054
01:09:38.012 --> 01:09:41.005
- Wow, that's weird.
- (phone beeps off)

1055
01:09:41.007 --> 01:09:44.023
- Someone told Kate
that Kevin's with us.
- Hmm.

1056
01:09:45.001 --> 01:09:47.023
Maybe I better go back
and check on him.
No.

1057
01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:51.015
That's exactly what he wants.
Peter, he's manipulating you.

1058
01:09:51.017 --> 01:09:54.017
Can't you see the pattern?
Every time we leave the house,
he pulls something.

1059
01:09:54.019 --> 01:09:58.021
He's just trying
to get your attention
and sabotage me.

1060
01:10:01.019 --> 01:10:06.000
Hello!
Anybody out there? Hello!

1061
01:10:12.015 --> 01:10:16.001
There's gotta be something that
we can do to get outta here.

1062
01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:23.004
There is.

1063
01:10:23.006 --> 01:10:26.019
Help me
move these boxes.
Okay.

1064
01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:28.019
But what's back there?

1065
01:10:28.021 --> 01:10:31.016
Definitely not
a "dumb" question.

1066
01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:34.007
The dumbwaiter!
Bingo.

1067
01:10:34.009 --> 01:10:37.020
- Let's hope it still works.
- I'm sorry I misjudged you,
Mr. Prescott.

1068
01:10:39.019 --> 01:10:41.017
Likewise.

1069
01:10:43.018 --> 01:10:46.003
I'll never forget
Miss Natalie's reaction...

1070
01:10:46.005 --> 01:10:48.014
when she came home and saw
what you'd done to the house.

1071
01:10:48.016 --> 01:10:51.023
- (rapid panting)
- (wheezing, laughing)

1072
01:10:52.001 --> 01:10:55.004
I do love watching her
hyperventilate!
(laughs)

1073
01:10:55.006 --> 01:10:58.006
It's one of the few pleasures
of this job.

1074
01:10:58.008 --> 01:11:00.012
If you hate this job,
why don't you quit?

1075
01:11:00.014 --> 01:11:03.010
Jobs aren't that easy
to come by.

1076
01:11:03.012 --> 01:11:06.010
Besides, I could end up
working for someone far worse.

1077
01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:11.020
You shouldn't stay someplace
you hate just 'cause you're
scared. Life's too short.

1078
01:11:13.004 --> 01:11:15.007
Hmm.

1079
01:11:16.007 --> 01:11:18.006
And voila.

1080
01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:21.004
Let's see if you fit.

1081
01:11:21.006 --> 01:11:23.011
Mm, up.

1082
01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:27.017
Watch your head.
As soon as I get up,
I'm gonna let you out.

1083
01:11:27.019 --> 01:11:32.000
You just take care of yourself,
you hear?
(switch clicks, whirring)

1084
01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:42.009
MARV:
I'm tellin' ya,
I heard something.

1085
01:11:44.015 --> 01:11:48.014
All right.
Stay very alert here, Vera.

1086
01:11:48.016 --> 01:11:51.004
I tell you what.
Why don't you go down,
check out the wine cellar?

1087
01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:53.009
Okay.
Yeah. There you go.

1088
01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.023
KEVIN: Down here!

1089
01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:03.007
You better stay-- Oww!

1090
01:12:03.009 --> 01:12:06.020
Vera! Ow! Aah! Vera!

1091
01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:09.005
What? Ooh!
Hit the button!

1092
01:12:09.007 --> 01:12:12.002
- Hang on, baby! Huuh!
- Oh! No, no! Hit the button!

1093
01:12:12.004 --> 01:12:15.006
What? I can't hear you.
Hit the button!

1094
01:12:15.008 --> 01:12:17.020
- Oh!
- Oww!

1095
01:12:17.022 --> 01:12:21.001
No, no! Not that one!
The other button!

1096
01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:24.000
That's it! Oww!

1097
01:12:25.016 --> 01:12:27.017
Hey!

1098
01:12:28.018 --> 01:12:30.019
Man!

1099
01:12:30.021 --> 01:12:33.011
Over here!

1100
01:12:35.005 --> 01:12:38.001
- (groaning)
- (Kevin laughing )

1101
01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:44.005
- Hi, Mommy.
- (gasps)

1102
01:13:00.004 --> 01:13:02.019
- Yes!
- (clicking buttons)

1103
01:13:02.021 --> 01:13:05.017
See ya. Door, open!

1104
01:13:05.019 --> 01:13:07.019
(grinding)

1105
01:13:15.009 --> 01:13:19.014
Natalie, you go get the royals.
I'm gonna go back
and check on Kevin.

1106
01:13:19.016 --> 01:13:23.001
- What, now?
- Yeah, somethin's up.
I can sense it.

1107
01:13:23.003 --> 01:13:27.014
- Maybe you have to be a parent.
- That's not fair. You know
how much I care about kids.

1108
01:13:27.016 --> 01:13:30.016
How much do you care
about my kid?

1109
01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:35.008
Taxi!

1110
01:13:37.015 --> 01:13:40.008
Kevin? Are you all right?

1111
01:13:47.008 --> 01:13:49.008
(grunting)

1112
01:13:57.006 --> 01:13:59.007
(horn honking)

1113
01:14:03.003 --> 01:14:06.015
Mom, do you think you could
slow down a little bit?
Kevin's probably fine.

1114
01:14:06.017 --> 01:14:09.003
You just keep an eye out
for cops, okay?

1115
01:14:09.005 --> 01:14:13.006
All right, Vera.
Go check out the living room.
See if he's in there, all right?

1116
01:14:13.008 --> 01:14:15.022
God! I can't believe this.

1117
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.004
I shoulda gone to college.
Two years, coulda been
a dental technician. Two years!

1118
01:14:20.006 --> 01:14:22.014
Marv! He's in the bedroom!

1119
01:14:22.016 --> 01:14:25.015
- Mom?
- Get him!

1120
01:14:28.009 --> 01:14:30.011
Door, open.

1121
01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:42.019
Got ya.

1122
01:14:52.011 --> 01:14:55.011
Uuh! Gaah!

1123
01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:58.017
Aah!

1124
01:14:58.019 --> 01:15:01.001
Ooh!

1125
01:15:01.003 --> 01:15:03.009
Door, close.

1126
01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:10.009
- Hey, Molly!
- Get in there!

1127
01:15:14.014 --> 01:15:17.009
- Marv, honey. You in there?
- (beeps)

1128
01:15:17.011 --> 01:15:19.009
<i>Shut up, Vera!</i>

1129
01:15:19.011 --> 01:15:22.004
Well, okay.
I was just tryin' to--

1130
01:15:22.006 --> 01:15:25.020
<i>- Shut up, you moron.</i>
- Hey, I'm no moron, you jerk.

1131
01:15:25.022 --> 01:15:28.021
<i>- Shut up, ya bag!</i>
- Door, open!

1132
01:15:34.021 --> 01:15:36.023
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

1133
01:15:37.001 --> 01:15:39.011
I'm no bag.
And you know what?
You ain't no genius!

1134
01:15:39.013 --> 01:15:41.018
Vera, honey--
No! Don't "Vera, honey" me!

1135
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.009
You're not even
as smart as this kid, who,
in case you hadn't noticed...

1136
01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:46.002
is totally kickin' our butts!

1137
01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:49.004
Well, from now on,
I am my own boss!

1138
01:15:49.006 --> 01:15:52.003
Vera. Vera, honey--
Don't "honey" me!

1139
01:15:52.005 --> 01:15:55.001
Pumpkin. Pumpkin.

1140
01:15:55.003 --> 01:15:59.005
Marv! Forget about her!
Get the kid! I'll be outta
here in a few minutes.

1141
01:15:59.007 --> 01:16:01.013
(buzzing)

1142
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
(thuds, buzzing stops)

1143
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.012
Oh!

1144
01:16:12.014 --> 01:16:14.018
(chuckling)

1145
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.008
Whoa!

1146
01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:19.020
(yelping)

1147
01:16:23.007 --> 01:16:25.011
(both groaning)

1148
01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:34.003
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:16:34.005 --> 01:16:36.009
Open sesame.

1150
01:16:36.011 --> 01:16:39.018
Well, get a load
of that.
Holy majolie!

1151
01:16:41.023 --> 01:16:46.023
Come on, Vera!
All right! Come on out, kid!

1152
01:16:47.001 --> 01:16:49.004
Ah! All right.

1153
01:16:49.006 --> 01:16:52.007
Open bar.
Open bookshelf.
(buzzes)

1154
01:16:52.009 --> 01:16:55.004
Open-- open book-bar.
Open book-bar-shelf.

1155
01:16:55.006 --> 01:16:58.017
Open--
open book-bar-thing.
Open sesame.

1156
01:16:58.019 --> 01:17:00.022
That's stupid.
Whoa!

1157
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.013
Who's stupid now, stupid?
Hey, come on.
Just get off me, all right?

1158
01:17:03.015 --> 01:17:06.002
MARV:
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

1159
01:17:06.004 --> 01:17:08.001
Bar, revolve sesame.

1160
01:17:08.003 --> 01:17:10.016
MARV: Watch this.
It's all gonna be fine.

1161
01:17:10.018 --> 01:17:13.004
Bar, stop.
Oh!
It's goin' faster!

1162
01:17:13.006 --> 01:17:16.019
Yeah, I know, Vera.
I know it's goin' faster.

1163
01:17:16.021 --> 01:17:20.006
- Speed faster sesame.
- Okay. The wife's not feelin'--

1164
01:17:21.018 --> 01:17:22.023
Faster sesame!

1165
01:17:26.012 --> 01:17:31.020
- (panicked yelling)
- Maximum speed sesame.

1166
01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:36.004
(Kevin laughing)

1167
01:17:39.013 --> 01:17:41.017
Stop sesame.
(gasps)

1168
01:17:53.010 --> 01:17:56.001
(screaming)

1169
01:17:59.002 --> 01:18:00.023
Nice jump, Marv.

1170
01:18:01.001 --> 01:18:03.008
(groaning)

1171
01:18:11.016 --> 01:18:14.014
Ohh!
(gasping)

1172
01:18:16.021 --> 01:18:19.008
Oof!

1173
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.010
Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.

1174
01:18:36.012 --> 01:18:38.021
Good night. Aah!
(Kevin gasps)

1175
01:18:41.009 --> 01:18:44.020
- Mr. Prescott!
- At your service.

1176
01:18:44.022 --> 01:18:47.017
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- (chuckles)

1177
01:18:47.019 --> 01:18:51.011
Perhaps we should
call the police.
Good idea, Mr. Prescott.

1178
01:18:51.013 --> 01:18:54.009
Just "Prescott" to you.

1179
01:18:56.013 --> 01:18:58.016
"Prescott!"

1180
01:19:08.006 --> 01:19:10.020
I thought you said
you weren't worried.
I don't know.

1181
01:19:10.022 --> 01:19:14.000
I just had a feeling.

1182
01:19:14.002 --> 01:19:17.000
- (Marv, Vera gasping)
- PETER: Kevin!

1183
01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:19.014
Dad!

1184
01:19:19.016 --> 01:19:22.010
Mom!
Mom?

1185
01:19:22.012 --> 01:19:25.000
- Who are they?
- Uh-oh!

1186
01:19:25.002 --> 01:19:27.008
Let's get outta here!
Around the back!

1187
01:19:27.010 --> 01:19:29.012
We're on it.
Let's go!
Kevin!

1188
01:19:39.012 --> 01:19:41.013
Ooh-ooh!

1189
01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:44.013
Yes!

1190
01:19:46.005 --> 01:19:48.007
Uuh!
Yeah! Way to go, guys!

1191
01:19:48.009 --> 01:19:50.012
KATE:
Kevin!

1192
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.005
- Kevin!
- Mom!

1193
01:19:54.007 --> 01:19:57.013
Oh, honey! I'm so glad
you're all right.
Ohh!

1194
01:19:57.015 --> 01:20:00.014
I am now!
I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

1195
01:20:00.016 --> 01:20:03.012
- Mmm!
- (Prescott clears throat)

1196
01:20:03.014 --> 01:20:06.003
The police
have been summoned.

1197
01:20:06.005 --> 01:20:08.011
I've got lots of fun
planned for your stay.

1198
01:20:08.013 --> 01:20:12.016
Can we go to Wrigley Field?
And the aquarium?
Do you have any kids?

1199
01:20:12.018 --> 01:20:17.022
No. But I promise we'll have
a very exciting time.

1200
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.023
- (sirens wailing)
- Cool!

1201
01:20:26.019 --> 01:20:29.012
Oh, come on.
No, prison's not so bad.
Oh, yeah?

1202
01:20:29.014 --> 01:20:32.012
Yeah. On Thursdays
you get Salisbury steak.
Yeah, I know about prison.

1203
01:20:32.014 --> 01:20:34.007
That's where I met you.
Calm down. Calm down.

1204
01:20:34.009 --> 01:20:36.013
You calm down.
Women, eh?

1205
01:20:36.015 --> 01:20:38.019
Yeah.
Hey, don't touch me.

1206
01:20:42.018 --> 01:20:46.006
- Peter! What's he done now?
- Well, he saved the day,
that's what.

1207
01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:49.009
You should be thanking him.

1208
01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:52.012
Molly? What in the world
is going on?

1209
01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:56.019
It seems they were gonna kidnap
the prince. Best we can gather,
she's the boss.

1210
01:20:56.021 --> 01:21:00.004
She's my maid.
I'm her boss!

1211
01:21:00.006 --> 01:21:02.012
Well, looks like you're
gonna have to find a new maid.

1212
01:21:02.014 --> 01:21:06.023
And a new butler,
I'm afraid.

1213
01:21:07.001 --> 01:21:09.015
- I resign.
- Resign?

1214
01:21:09.017 --> 01:21:11.022
But... why?

1215
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.015
Because as a wise young man
once said, "Life's too short."

1216
01:21:18.008 --> 01:21:21.006
Peter, do something.

1217
01:21:23.016 --> 01:21:27.005
All right. Here goes.

1218
01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:32.001
Natalie,
I think I mistook...

1219
01:21:32.003 --> 01:21:35.009
infatuation and excitement
for love.

1220
01:21:35.011 --> 01:21:39.014
Look, this--
this is your world.
It's not mine.

1221
01:21:39.016 --> 01:21:42.017
The whole time I was here,
all I did was miss my family.

1222
01:21:42.019 --> 01:21:45.000
I'm in love
with my wife and kids,

1223
01:21:45.002 --> 01:21:47.022
and I belong with them.

1224
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.012
And I wanna come home.
I mean, I understand if you
need time to think about it.

1225
01:21:54.004 --> 01:21:56.011
Mom?

1226
01:21:59.022 --> 01:22:01.021
Oh!
(crying)

1227
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.016
I love you.
I love you.

1228
01:22:05.018 --> 01:22:09.019
Young man, how are we ever
going to show you our gratitude?

1229
01:22:09.021 --> 01:22:12.018
Would your family like to spend
Christmas with our family?

1230
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.006
That sounds cool.

1231
01:22:15.008 --> 01:22:17.011
- Is that okay?
- (chuckles) Yes.

1232
01:22:17.013 --> 01:22:20.002
You're going to be with them?

1233
01:22:20.004 --> 01:22:23.015
Today? On Christmas?

1234
01:22:23.017 --> 01:22:26.010
(crying)

1235
01:22:26.012 --> 01:22:29.014
(panting)

1236
01:22:31.002 --> 01:22:33.013
Thank you.

1237
01:22:35.004 --> 01:22:38.009
Music, on.
(Christmas music playing)

1238
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.018
Snow, fall.

1239
01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.015
Ha ha! Hey!

1240
01:22:45.017 --> 01:22:48.006
I knew this was gonna be
the best Christmas ever!

1241
01:22:48.008 --> 01:22:50.021
(all exclaiming)

1242
01:22:50.045 --> 01:22:52.045
