00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:41.041
{\an8}song plays:

2
00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:47.756
Asi me gusta baby.

3
00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:50.092
See? Makes all the
pretty girls smile.

4
00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:51.801
Even the ugly ones.

5
00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:53.304
But we leave them at home.

6
00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:57.808
- Todo bien Papi?
- Si.

7
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.311
How can we argue
with a pretty smile?

8
00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:02.605
We got five full K's this time.

9
00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:04.482
90% pure.

10
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.652
Happy to trade.

11
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.655
I love it when our

12
00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:14.825
two countries can come
together in unity.

13
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:16.535
Si.

14
00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:19.579
Right sweetheart?

15
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.748
Claro que si.

16
00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:22.249
Salud.

17
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:23.833
- Ha ha.
- To America.

18
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:24.834
And Mexico.

19
00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:26.169
Viva.

20
00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:27.505
Salud.

21
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.515
Woo!

22
00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:40.266
She's nice, right?

23
00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.267
Hmm.

24
00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.520
- Woo.

25
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:45.355
Me encanta como bailas mi amor.

26
00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:46.690
Yeah.

27
00:01:54.198 --> 00:01:55.199
Nice.

28
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.625
- Shit.
- Don't move...

29
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.711
or die right here.

30
00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:11.715
Give him the case.

31
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:13.634
Do it.

32
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.178
Give him the fucking case.

33
00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:22.559
Eyes down.

34
00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:24.978
Hey, it's me.

35
00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.146
Eyes down!

36
00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:40.577
No, no, no, it's me.

37
00:02:40.578 --> 00:02:41.828
It's me. It's Kahane.

38
00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.746
No, no, no, we're DEA!

39
00:02:43.747 --> 00:02:45.291
- We're DEA!

40
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:48.878
No, no, no!

41
00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:55.301
No!

42
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.972
Jesus fucking Christ.

43
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:02.390
What'd you do that for?

44
00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:03.517
He recognized me.

45
00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.269
We used to work together.

46
00:03:16.864 --> 00:03:17.864
Let's go.

47
00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:19.282
Now!

48
00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.829
Shit.

49
00:03:32.338 --> 00:03:33.338
Chief!

50
00:03:37.927 --> 00:03:38.928
Come on!

51
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.608
There were two of them.

52
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.698
Chief, we gotta go.

53
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.450
Let's blow this pop stand.

54
00:06:00.778 --> 00:06:01.778
Agh.

55
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.364
{\an8} <i>For three days now</i>

56
00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:48.991
<i>the crowd has remained
here at full strength.</i>

57
00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.701
<i>Their agitation is apparent</i>

58
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.204
<i>but they have been remaining
peaceful for the most part.</i>

59
00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:55.331
<i>Their frustration and passion</i>

60
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:58.084
<i>seem to be less directed
toward the current issues</i>

61
00:06:58.085 --> 00:06:59.335
<i>facing the San Diego...</i>

62
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.420
<i>Un-authorized migrant crossings</i>

63
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.840
<i>at the South West border
are at all time high.</i>

64
00:07:03.841 --> 00:07:05.842
<i>More than 1.9 million</i>

65
00:07:05.843 --> 00:07:07.009
<i>in the last eleven months</i>

66
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.138
<i>but as of yesterday here
in Southern California,</i>

67
00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.014
<i>Mexico and the U.S. authorities</i>

68
00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.142
<i>have discovered a nearly
eighteen hundred foot</i>

69
00:07:14.143 --> 00:07:17.937
<i>tunnel used to smuggle drugs
from a home in Tijuana, Mexico</i>

70
00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.730
<i>to a warehouse
south of San Diego.</i>

71
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.526
<i>About seventeen hundred pounds
of cocaine were seized...</i>

72
00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.777
<i>Police spokesperson</i>

73
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.737
<i>outside of the initial
press conference</i>

74
00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:29.866
{\an8}<i>explained little regarding
the alleged brutal assault</i>

75
00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:32.703
{\an8}<i>of the migrant driver on
Monday by an officer...</i>

76
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.043
<i>Authorities have found about 15</i>

77
00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.795
{\an8}<i>sophisticated tunnels on</i>

78
00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:45.631
{\an8}<i>California's borders
with Mexico since 2006</i>

79
00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.009
{\an8}<i>but this recent one is one
of the largest on record</i>

80
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.760
{\an8}<i>and the efforts into
moving people and drugs</i>

81
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.723
{\an8}<i>into the country, shows
no signs of stopping.</i>

82
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.812
{\an8} What do we want! Justice!

83
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:03.650
That's him.

84
00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:05.444
That's him.

85
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:08.363
Ugh.

86
00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.594
Yeah, once that...

87
00:08:31.595 --> 00:08:32.763
I'll call you back.

88
00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:34.055
Hey, Joe.

89
00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:39.769
Hey,

90
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.103
don't pout big guy.

91
00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:42.105
You look good.

92
00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:43.941
All dressed up for your big day?

93
00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:45.608
Hey come here.

94
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.152
No.

95
00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:48.946
Come on, come here.

96
00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:51.781
I don't want a hug.

97
00:08:51.782 --> 00:08:53.324
What? I'm not gonna
give you a hug.

98
00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:54.992
What's wrong with you?

99
00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.661
Wait, do you need a hug?

100
00:08:56.662 --> 00:08:58.287
I mean somebody here
probably knows how to.

101
00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.164
I'm sure I could find somebody.

102
00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:01.750
Thank you, yeah.

103
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.930
Come in.

104
00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:17.765
Sit down.

105
00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.686
Can't figure any
of this shit out.

106
00:09:21.687 --> 00:09:22.687
Sir.

107
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.147
Ain't no job in the world

108
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:27.817
where having a bad day
has bigger repercussions,

109
00:09:27.818 --> 00:09:29.111
maybe an airline pilot.

110
00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:30.696
That's right.

111
00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:32.989
Okay.

112
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.367
Watch.

113
00:09:49.715 --> 00:09:52.801
<i>Joe! Hey, Joe, Joe, Joe, Hey!</i>

114
00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.595
<i>No cameras. Turn those
off. Turn them...</i>

115
00:09:57.222 --> 00:09:58.724
Now for the good stuff.

116
00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:00.767
<i>Joe, Joe.</i>

117
00:10:01.018 --> 00:10:02.184
<i>Stay on the ground.</i>

118
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:04.020
<i>Take it easy, man. Easy.</i>

119
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:05.647
<i>Mexican lowlife.</i>

120
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.357
There we go.

121
00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:09.860
That, was the headline.

122
00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:11.110
Mexican lowlife.

123
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.945
Google it and your
face comes out.

124
00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.740
They have these things they
call memes of you saying

125
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:17.867
'Mexican lowlife' over and over.

126
00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:19.785
Crazy what they
can do these days.

127
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:21.829
Well he was an
illegal from Mexico.

128
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.622
He certainly was a
lowlife so technically...

129
00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.832
Johansen...

130
00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:25.833
shut it for a sec.

131
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.378
Your attitude is a
complete PR nightmare.

132
00:10:29.463 --> 00:10:31.380
I'm very sorry sir but
you have the mayor's party

133
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.882
waiting for you
in the press room.

134
00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:34.633
Shit. All right thanks
I'll be right there.

135
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:36.218
Maybe it'd be better if I didn't

136
00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.054
go to the press
conference because...

137
00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:39.139
Yeah ha ha. Walk with me.

138
00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.352
Close my door on the way out.

139
00:10:45.062 --> 00:10:46.520
You do realize you're now the

140
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.855
'defund the police'
poster child?

141
00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.565
Jesus, Chief the fucking guy had

142
00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.400
a dozen traffic girls in
the back of that truck.

143
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.777
Gave us chase for two miles.

144
00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:55.197
How come no one mentions
that shit in the news?

145
00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:57.573
I get it. Trust me.

146
00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.658
That's why despite
your lovely behavior

147
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.285
and the shit show
of a mob outside

148
00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.870
I'm recommending you for a job,

149
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.997
a job that has 'good
idea' written all over it.

150
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.751
- Job? Already got a...
- Not much longer.

151
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.168
Look, listen to me.

152
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.419
You'll not only lose your job

153
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.798
you'll lose your pension and
you'll probably be prosecuted.

154
00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:15.257
So do you want to hear this

155
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.717
or do you want to apply at
Walgreens across the street?

156
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.221
Yes sir. Ehem, I mean no sir.

157
00:11:21.098 --> 00:11:22.098
How's the ankle?

158
00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:24.141
Uh, it's getting better.

159
00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:27.103
Having surgery, I'm taking
care of it thanks. Don't worry

160
00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:28.104
Good.

161
00:11:28.105 --> 00:11:30.856
Now 87% of your colleagues
have already retired.

162
00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:33.067
Normal humans do that
at your age in this job.

163
00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.236
You know you do a thing
for a while then you

164
00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:38.030
get on your horse and you
ride off into the sunset.

165
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.448
So do you want to hear this?

166
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.449
Yes, sir.

167
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.787
The DEA murders in
Silverado, remember that?

168
00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.998
Yeah, two undercover agents
killed in a drug buy.

169
00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:48.917
Real clusterfuck.

170
00:11:48.918 --> 00:11:51.085
Now the night they were
killed with those traffickers

171
00:11:51.086 --> 00:11:53.088
we found the body of
that working girl.

172
00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:55.381
Yeah, I remember one of...

173
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.925
Mason's girls at
Frisky's on the 135.

174
00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:58.718
Yeah.

175
00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:01.470
Well he said he sent two other
hookers to that same party.

176
00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:03.849
They weren't found that
night dead or alive.

177
00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.558
Yeah, I remember it

178
00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.767
two missing hookers.

179
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.186
Well, they just turned up.

180
00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:09.854
Mexico.

181
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.773
Shoplifting arrest.

182
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.108
We just got word from
the U.S. Attorney

183
00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:16.569
that we can bring those
ladies in for questioning.

184
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.947
They were either involved
or may know who was.

185
00:12:19.156 --> 00:12:20.740
And I took some convincing

186
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:22.700
but I got the marshals to agree

187
00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.493
to send you down
to represent them

188
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.203
and represent us

189
00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:29.082
and bring those two witnesses
back here from Mexico ASAP.

190
00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:35.839
Uh, Mexico.

191
00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:37.674
Can I think about it?

192
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:40.926
Johansen,

193
00:12:40.927 --> 00:12:43.430
this isn't just a good
idea, it's the only idea.

194
00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:45.473
Let me spell it out for you

195
00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:48.100
you have to go save
yours and our reputation.

196
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.060
Got it?

197
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:51.188
Or... you're fucked.

198
00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.699
Chief, they're waiting for us.

199
00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.559
My fellow Del Vista citizens

200
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.980
it is with great humility
and respect for human dignity

201
00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:37.233
that we have come
here today to address

202
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:38.568
an unfortunate incident.

203
00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:42.154
Chief Hernandez will explain

204
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.490
what went terribly wrong.

205
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:45.867
Chief.

206
00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.946
<i>Sergeant Johansen</i>

207
00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:25.447
<i>made an inexcusable mistake</i>

208
00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:26.907
<i>and we're extremely sorry.</i>

209
00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.826
<i>He's been a cop for
over twenty years</i>

210
00:14:28.827 --> 00:14:30.119
<i>and he's come to realize that-</i>

211
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.620
- Can you turn that off?
<i>- There's still things he</i>

212
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:33.289
<i>has to learn about</i>

213
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.290
<i>the Hispanic people</i>

214
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:35.917
<i>and their beautiful culture.</i>

215
00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.167
<i>Any questions?</i>

216
00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:43.674
To the most wanted man of
the 'Me Too' generation

217
00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:46.635
in California Police history.

218
00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:49.139
Ha. And to that
kiss-ass job in Mexico.

219
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.642
It's a damn publicity stunt.

220
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:54.894
Not a job.

221
00:14:54.895 --> 00:14:57.021
I tried to talk the
chief out of it.

222
00:14:57.022 --> 00:15:00.149
I figured you'd be better off on
vacation till the next asshole

223
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.692
does something
politically incorrect,

224
00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:03.653
and then you're just,
you know, old news.

225
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.573
He's already old news!

226
00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:09.659
Thank you Crystal.
That was lovely.

227
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.167
You should talk Brynner.
She's half your age.

228
00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.001
That girl?

229
00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:21.003
She makes twice my pension.

230
00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:22.171
Ha. Bet she does.

231
00:15:22.172 --> 00:15:25.507
So how many years did I work
for that asshole Hernandez?

232
00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.134
He never sent me to Mexico, huh?

233
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.677
And I got all the shirts for it.

234
00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.054
Big man.

235
00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:31.014
Yeah.

236
00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:33.349
Don't do it. Just look
at the boss and say:

237
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.309
'It's too dangerous
to go to Mexico.'

238
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:36.645
Mostly because...

239
00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:38.187
What?

240
00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:39.939
Loaded with Mexicans.

241
00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.442
- He's funny.
- He's right.

242
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.110
Look I just hate
assholes who just use

243
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.488
our country as a doormat

244
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:49.239
to wipe their dirty feet on.

245
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.699
That's bullshit.

246
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.534
Yeah you know the second
they cross over that line

247
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:53.702
they want a lawyer.

248
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:54.579
They want some-

249
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.705
they want a place to live,
they want some extra money.

250
00:15:56.706 --> 00:16:00.334
And they want a green
card. I'm sorry... asshole

251
00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.169
You're illegal.
You don't get shit.

252
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.797
Yeah that's right. My dad
came over from Sweden.

253
00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:06.757
The guy I worked his ass off.

254
00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:07.883
Was in the Marines

255
00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:11.053
bled for this country
didn't get anything for free

256
00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:13.222
and these people
just walk in here.

257
00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:14.057
They want it all

258
00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:16.266
just because they
crossed that line.

259
00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.686
Think you're gonna hear
that on CNN, MSNBC?

260
00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.270
But even fucking Fox, man,

261
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:22.064
they don't tell you
the real, not anymore.

262
00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:23.190
- Hey, I love Fox.
- Yeah.

263
00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.567
Ha ha oh, boy. Used to be bad

264
00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:27.152
but now it's a fucking joke.

265
00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:27.987
- That's right.
- Yeah.

266
00:16:27.988 --> 00:16:30.073
The whole fucking
thing is a joke.

267
00:16:31.282 --> 00:16:33.075
I agree, so

268
00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:35.745
take it as the big hint
you know? Get out of dodge.

269
00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.539
Retire, brother.

270
00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:41.333
- And don't go to Mexico.
- Yeah, yeah.

271
00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:42.626
Listen to Hilts.

272
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.754
Walk in there and tell Hernandez
to shove this job up his ass

273
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:49.091
and throw that badge on the desk
just like Dirty fucking Harry.

274
00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:51.009
Come down, spend time
with your friends.

275
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.720
Get a twenty year
old on your lap.

276
00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.096
There you go.

277
00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:55.681
You weren't much
better at conversation

278
00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:57.141
when we rode together Brynner.

279
00:16:57.142 --> 00:17:00.686
I appreciate the pep talk boys
but I'm heading south tomorrow

280
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.938
so get me a drink or a stripper

281
00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.566
- or something so I can...
- Yo!

282
00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.275
Robbery.

283
00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.818
Hands up.

284
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:08.861
I'm sorry, ladies

285
00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.696
bingo is three doors down.

286
00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.239
I just spent some
time with your mother

287
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.866
in the broom closet down there.

288
00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:15.617
She's still decomposing?

289
00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:16.703
That is hot.

290
00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.245
That's hot.

291
00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:19.581
That's my future ex-wife.

292
00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.749
Oh, she never heard that before.

293
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.250
Oh, come on.

294
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.043
What, is it is it me
or are these girls...

295
00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:26.628
Getting younger and younger?

296
00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:29.715
No, no. That's just you getting
older and older, Tinelli.

297
00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.801
- That's right.
- I can live with that.

298
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:36.221
Hey, Johansen you looked
good on TV this morning.

299
00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.641
Oh, really? Well,
thanks, psycho.

300
00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.685
Where did you get that hat?

301
00:17:41.686 --> 00:17:44.813
We got to find another place to
hang out, strip clubs are so...

302
00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.523
I don't know, they're so 80s.

303
00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:47.733
I like the 80s.

304
00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.276
80s are okay with me.

305
00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:50.652
Hey, I need another shot.

306
00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:51.862
- Go.
- You want?

307
00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:53.906
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Something brown.

308
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.699
Let me drive you
home, all right?

309
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.367
You sure you want
to go tomorrow?

310
00:17:57.368 --> 00:17:58.494
- Yeah.
- Easy.

311
00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.287
I drive better drunk
than you do sober.

312
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.415
- Oh, come on. Please -
Yeah, that's right. I'm fine.

313
00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.918
- I'm great.
- All right.

314
00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:08.712
All right buddy, see you
when I'm back stateside.

315
00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:11.508
Hey, you're a work in
progress, you know that?

316
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.593
- All right, yeah.
- Take it easy down there.

317
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.678
Yeah yeah. I'll have
a few tequila shots.

318
00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:17.763
Ha ha. All right.

319
00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.182
- On you.
- Yeah.

320
00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.601
Hey, what the hell?

321
00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:23.852
Take it easy.

322
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.772
- Take it easy.
- Hey. Hey.

323
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.655
I'm sorry, señor.

324
00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.574
Señor?

325
00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:38.827
You're sorry?

326
00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:40.869
You got a license?

327
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.872
- Yes, of course.
- How about a green card?

328
00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.750
Actually, I was born in Arizona.

329
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.503
Have I seen you before?

330
00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:50.587
Yeah, maybe so.

331
00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:53.674
Joe, it's okay man let it go.
It was an accident, all right?

332
00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:55.342
Sir, I'm going to go into my car

333
00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.803
get my license and registration
okay? Just give me a minute.

334
00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.515
Hey, you know what you are?

335
00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:01.975
You're...

336
00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.730
It's a damn scratch, anyway.

337
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.233
- Ha.
- Yeah.

338
00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:13.735
Forget it.

339
00:19:13.736 --> 00:19:15.530
All right, all right.

340
00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:17.239
I'm sorry, sir.

341
00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:11.919
Ugh.

342
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.927
Hey, amigo,

343
00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.638
you'll take good care
of that Smith & Wesson.

344
00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:24.599
It's an expensive
American piece of art.

345
00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.935
And we will cherish her forever.

346
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:30.647
Don't worry. We'll give it
back to you oiled and polished.

347
00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:32.773
Officer De La Cruz.

348
00:20:32.774 --> 00:20:33.983
Mexican Federal Police.

349
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.487
Liaison to the wonderful
world of extraditions.

350
00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:41.782
Personally I prefer this
.45 caliber Jericho 941

351
00:20:41.783 --> 00:20:42.825
made in Israel.

352
00:20:43.034 --> 00:20:44.911
We can pick our own
on weapons here.

353
00:20:47.497 --> 00:20:48.581
Johansen.

354
00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:50.541
Detective Sergeant.

355
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.002
So you're the Great White Whale.

356
00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:54.878
Excuse me?

357
00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:55.880
Gran Ballena Blanca.

358
00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:57.799
Moby Dick.

359
00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:01.260
News down here likes to give
personalities, special names.

360
00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:05.555
Your English is pretty good.

361
00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:07.100
My Italian is even better.

362
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.102
Four years, San Diego State.

363
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:11.980
It's a 3180.

364
00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.858
Sign here and here.

365
00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.279
The U.S. Marshal signed
already this morning.

366
00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.700
They meet us on your
way back to the border.

367
00:21:24.826 --> 00:21:25.826
Wait.

368
00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:28.788
I thought I was supposed
to pick 'em up here.

369
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:30.123
Andale.

370
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.875
- Detective.
- I can't believe this.

371
00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:38.880
Regarding the DEA murder
victims in that drug shootout,

372
00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:40.215
the U.S. attorney

373
00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:42.592
just cleared the red tape
with the victims' families.

374
00:21:42.593 --> 00:21:45.053
No death penalty in case
of prosecution for either

375
00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:46.723
so all governments are happy.

376
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.932
We can now saddle up, cowboy,

377
00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.809
and go get your witnesses

378
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.894
our two lovely
travel companions.

379
00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:54.062
How long?

380
00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:55.314
Three hours.

381
00:21:58.067 --> 00:21:59.068
Ugh.

382
00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:12.123
One day I'd like to get
involved with the DEA.

383
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:13.707
Put in my time here

384
00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.001
maybe a couple more years

385
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.169
and put in for a transfer.

386
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.921
I've already studied in the
States on a temporary visa

387
00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:22.050
for four years so
should be pretty easy.

388
00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:23.801
Uh-huh.

389
00:22:25.178 --> 00:22:27.055
You know those drugs
flow both ways.

390
00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.599
It's true, they don't
all come from here.

391
00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:33.102
But I admit it gets
pretty bad at the border.

392
00:22:34.687 --> 00:22:35.813
Los coyotes make it bad.

393
00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:48.784
We're stopping here?

394
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:49.785
Exactly.

395
00:22:50.036 --> 00:22:52.120
Don't worry. We make it
nice and easy for you.

396
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:53.790
Quick in, quick out.

397
00:22:54.123 --> 00:22:56.959
Get you home to your
beautiful strippers and beer.

398
00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:00.962
I'm fucking with you.

399
00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:03.633
I know it's a stereotype
about you American cops.

400
00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:45.007
Detective Sergeant.

401
00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:46.843
Mr. Gran Ballena.

402
00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:48.218
Come meet our witnesses,

403
00:23:48.219 --> 00:23:49.928
Leticia Gomez

404
00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:51.597
and Señorita Rosa Barranco.

405
00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:53.850
Someone tried to
kill her last week.

406
00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:56.018
¿Nos van a entregar
con este güero?

407
00:23:56.936 --> 00:23:57.978
¿Que no lo ves?

408
00:23:57.979 --> 00:23:58.896
¿Que no entiendes?

409
00:23:58.897 --> 00:24:01.064
What the hell is this
one yelling about?

410
00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:04.025
She says we might as well kill
her now and be done with it.

411
00:24:04.026 --> 00:24:07.571
Okay, I'll think about it.
Let's get back stateside first.

412
00:24:07.572 --> 00:24:08.697
Into the car.

413
00:24:08.698 --> 00:24:10.866
Mira si nos encuentran
muertos va a ser tu culpa.

414
00:24:10.867 --> 00:24:13.578
¡Pinche cerdo! Me las
vas a pagar pendejo.

415
00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:17.582
¿Que no se das cuenta?

416
00:24:21.711 --> 00:24:23.087
Ugh.

417
00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:26.923
Esto no puede ser pasando.

418
00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:28.551
Rosa nos van a
encontrar muert...

419
00:24:33.222 --> 00:24:36.808
Yeah that's right.
Gomez and Barranco.

420
00:24:36.809 --> 00:24:39.060
Got the witnesses right here.

421
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:41.564
We'll be in San Diego
in a couple of hours.

422
00:24:41.898 --> 00:24:42.815
All right, boss.

423
00:24:42.816 --> 00:24:44.649
Porque no le cuentas
a tu jefe tambien

424
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.152
que en dos horas nos
van a encontrar muertas.

425
00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:48.905
- What?
- Tu eres el maton?

426
00:24:50.615 --> 00:24:52.157
Pinche gato.

427
00:24:52.158 --> 00:24:53.659
Yeah, yeah.

428
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.077
Shut the fuck up.

429
00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:56.871
I'm tired.

430
00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:05.086
So I was trying to decide

431
00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:06.881
between a cop or a firefighter

432
00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:09.884
but I ended up as a
federali at the border.

433
00:25:10.718 --> 00:25:11.802
My English and all.

434
00:25:12.803 --> 00:25:14.931
Make more of a difference
that way, you know?

435
00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:18.184
And I might try acting if
I ever go to Hollywood.

436
00:25:19.185 --> 00:25:21.729
Sometimes I mess around
with movie lines.

437
00:25:23.814 --> 00:25:25.106
You looking at me?

438
00:25:25.107 --> 00:25:26.776
There's nobody else around here.

439
00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:28.610
Or...

440
00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:30.780
Say hello to my little friend.

441
00:25:31.781 --> 00:25:32.948
That's Pacino.

442
00:25:32.949 --> 00:25:34.825
Mhmm.

443
00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.140
With my real police skills

444
00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:01.142
plus being bilingual and all,

445
00:26:01.143 --> 00:26:02.979
I think I got a
pretty good shot.

446
00:26:08.943 --> 00:26:10.944
¿Algún problema?

447
00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:13.698
- ¡Hazte a un lado!
- Soy oficial federal.

448
00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:20.454
Get down!

449
00:27:06.876 --> 00:27:08.127
What the fuck is going on?

450
00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:13.382
No, freeze! Drop the weapon!

451
00:27:18.888 --> 00:27:19.889
Leti.

452
00:27:21.515 --> 00:27:22.850
Leti!

453
00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:24.685
Leti!

454
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.733
Chief, I need help down here.

455
00:27:31.233 --> 00:27:32.901
We were ambushed

456
00:27:32.902 --> 00:27:35.112
by two shooters dressed
as police officers.

457
00:27:35.446 --> 00:27:37.114
Yeah, I'm okay.

458
00:27:38.741 --> 00:27:39.992
No, they're dead.

459
00:27:40.743 --> 00:27:42.870
Leti!

460
00:27:43.204 --> 00:27:45.497
I need back up. Right this...

461
00:27:45.498 --> 00:27:46.748
<i>Ok, ok. Tell me where you are.</i>

462
00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:47.916
<i>I'll find out if I
can send anybody.</i>

463
00:27:47.917 --> 00:27:49.125
Shit.

464
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:50.127
I've been hit.

465
00:27:50.878 --> 00:27:51.962
I'll call you back.

466
00:27:52.213 --> 00:27:54.423
Ayudame por favor.

467
00:27:58.344 --> 00:28:02.973
Leti! Leti! Ayudame!

468
00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:09.146
Leti!

469
00:28:15.486 --> 00:28:16.778
She Dead?

470
00:28:16.779 --> 00:28:17.863
Muerta?

471
00:28:18.155 --> 00:28:19.740
Yes, muerte.

472
00:28:19.949 --> 00:28:20.949
She's dead.

473
00:28:21.117 --> 00:28:22.867
She never wanted any of this.

474
00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:25.453
Okay, we need to find
something to bandage my wound.

475
00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:27.956
I knew they were going to
kill us for what we saw.

476
00:28:27.957 --> 00:28:29.124
They killed my friend.

477
00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:31.001
My friend Leti!

478
00:28:32.837 --> 00:28:35.213
I need you to go to
that vehicle over there.

479
00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:36.924
Look for a first aid kit.

480
00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:40.886
First aid kit.

481
00:28:48.144 --> 00:28:49.979
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

482
00:28:54.483 --> 00:28:56.360
No. What are you doing?

483
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.821
Ahh shit.

484
00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:04.034
Come back. Wait.

485
00:29:04.577 --> 00:29:05.910
Ugh.

486
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:06.911
Wait.

487
00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:11.958
Come back.

488
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:15.503
Ahh.

489
00:29:17.298 --> 00:29:18.424
Come back.

490
00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:22.761
Come back.

491
00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:35.691
That's what you're looking for?

492
00:29:42.448 --> 00:29:44.158
Ahh. Easy.

493
00:29:45.034 --> 00:29:46.451
Use that big one.

494
00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:47.535
Stop the bleeding.

495
00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:49.162
Okay, okay. I don't know you.

496
00:29:49.163 --> 00:29:50.873
I don't give a fuck about you.

497
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.959
They'll be here soon
and I won't be here.

498
00:29:55.878 --> 00:29:57.045
Those...

499
00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:58.297
were...

500
00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:00.257
real cops?

501
00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:02.843
Mexico's finest.

502
00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.054
We need to get out of here.

503
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:07.889
Hospital.

504
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.059
No, no, no, no. That's
not where you want to go.

505
00:30:11.227 --> 00:30:13.812
Look I know a place but...

506
00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:16.940
Ahh.

507
00:30:16.941 --> 00:30:19.484
Hey, hey, hey no more
of your fucking calls.

508
00:30:19.485 --> 00:30:23.029
Someone knew that we were
here when you called everyone.

509
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.031
Now they're going to know
that we're still alive

510
00:30:25.032 --> 00:30:27.159
so no more of your
fucking calls, entiendes?

511
00:30:29.954 --> 00:30:32.039
Siempre con el pinche teléfono.

512
00:31:44.069 --> 00:31:45.069
Uh.

513
00:31:48.699 --> 00:31:49.992
Who are you?

514
00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:51.577
What happened?

515
00:31:52.077 --> 00:31:53.579
Where's that hooker?

516
00:31:55.497 --> 00:31:56.582
I mean...

517
00:31:57.166 --> 00:31:58.167
woman.

518
00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.544
Hey, qué pasa?

519
00:32:08.052 --> 00:32:09.511
Hey, what's going on?

520
00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:14.682
Hey, I'm talking to you.

521
00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:16.267
Habla inglés?

522
00:32:16.268 --> 00:32:18.187
Ah, shit.

523
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.148
Don't worry.

524
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.651
You still have all your organs.

525
00:32:24.068 --> 00:32:25.068
You.

526
00:32:26.195 --> 00:32:27.529
What the hell happened?

527
00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:30.491
This is my brother.

528
00:32:31.825 --> 00:32:34.036
He's not one of the ones
who tried to kill you.

529
00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:37.789
Like I said those were real
police yesterday in name.

530
00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.248
But just because
you wear the badge

531
00:32:39.249 --> 00:32:41.168
doesn't mean you
always live by it.

532
00:32:41.627 --> 00:32:43.545
I believe they're
trying to kill you.

533
00:32:46.048 --> 00:32:48.050
This is called kidnapping.

534
00:32:48.592 --> 00:32:50.343
Necesita descansar.

535
00:32:50.344 --> 00:32:52.596
Ya cuando se recupere
veo que hacer con el.

536
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.598
He said you need to rest.

537
00:32:54.807 --> 00:32:57.643
Then later we'll talk
about what we do with you.

538
00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.603
Where's my phone?

539
00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:01.063
I need that.

540
00:33:01.064 --> 00:33:03.523
I used it to get you
off the road yesterday

541
00:33:03.524 --> 00:33:04.732
where your red
white and blue blood

542
00:33:04.733 --> 00:33:06.568
was flowing down the pavement...

543
00:33:07.236 --> 00:33:08.737
and then I smashed it to pieces.

544
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:12.240
Just relax.

545
00:33:12.241 --> 00:33:14.243
We had a doctor fix
you up the right way.

546
00:33:14.785 --> 00:33:18.163
He said the bullet's out but
you gotta rest at least a week.

547
00:33:18.706 --> 00:33:20.541
Thanks, but a week? No way.

548
00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:24.502
People from the States are
gonna wonder where I am.

549
00:33:24.503 --> 00:33:25.586
You gotta let me go.

550
00:33:25.587 --> 00:33:28.089
No lo puedo tener aqui
mucho lo van a encontrar.

551
00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.133
Where's my gun?

552
00:33:29.508 --> 00:33:31.051
- I need that.
- Hey!

553
00:33:31.301 --> 00:33:33.220
Necesitas. Descansar.

554
00:33:34.304 --> 00:33:35.681
You need to rest.

555
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:38.016
Wait.

556
00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:39.518
Hey. Agh.

557
00:34:03.167 --> 00:34:04.585
Hey...

558
00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:09.130
get me out of these cuffs.

559
00:34:09.131 --> 00:34:11.175
There's 500 bucks in it for you.

560
00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:18.222
A thousand?

561
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.602
Hey...

562
00:34:25.647 --> 00:34:26.815
talking to you.

563
00:34:32.029 --> 00:34:33.155
Comida?

564
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:37.951
Okay.

565
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.661
Yeah.

566
00:34:49.338 --> 00:34:50.839
Change of the guard, huh?

567
00:35:10.317 --> 00:35:11.527
Mhmm.

568
00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:13.612
Gracias.

569
00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:15.697
Bueno.

570
00:35:20.369 --> 00:35:21.703
It's good prison food.

571
00:35:29.711 --> 00:35:31.712
Hey, how you doing? Hello.

572
00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:33.214
Good to see you, boys.

573
00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:34.049
Jimmy.

574
00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:35.925
How you been, man?
Lose some weight?

575
00:35:35.926 --> 00:35:37.135
You look good.

576
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.763
What?

577
00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:42.223
You missing your old life?

578
00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:43.224
No.

579
00:35:43.684 --> 00:35:45.227
I miss my young life.

580
00:35:46.311 --> 00:35:47.728
- Asshole.
- Ha ha.

581
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:48.814
What's happening?

582
00:35:49.815 --> 00:35:52.233
The news is going nuts on all
this now, Joe's getting famous.

583
00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:54.569
- Yeah.
- Killing some Mexican cops.

584
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.863
On the run with a witness.

585
00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:58.322
One hell of a story.

586
00:35:58.323 --> 00:35:59.323
Yeah.

587
00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:03.744
- I'll call you back.

588
00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:04.745
Brynner.

589
00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:09.250
Okay look,

590
00:36:09.251 --> 00:36:10.877
I know you're all
old friends but

591
00:36:10.878 --> 00:36:13.379
I can't start talking out
of the office right now.

592
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.007
This turned into obviously
the worst move of my career.

593
00:36:16.008 --> 00:36:19.261
Just a concerned civilian
now, Chief. Come on.

594
00:36:19.928 --> 00:36:21.638
And I appreciate your concern.

595
00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:24.600
But right now I have to keep
this clean and contained.

596
00:36:25.726 --> 00:36:27.102
You hear back from him yet?

597
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.023
I can tell you that
I've been on the phone

598
00:36:32.024 --> 00:36:33.691
ad nauseam with state and feds.

599
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:35.943
They're picking this
up. We will find him.

600
00:36:35.944 --> 00:36:38.697
I'm sure there's an explanation
for this clusterfuck.

601
00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:43.034
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying
your tour of the office

602
00:36:43.035 --> 00:36:44.660
but is there something...

603
00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:45.995
This job...

604
00:36:45.996 --> 00:36:47.413
It's just a little
tougher to step away from

605
00:36:47.414 --> 00:36:49.082
than you think it's going to be.

606
00:36:50.834 --> 00:36:52.961
I'd like to get back
into the thick of it.

607
00:36:53.587 --> 00:36:54.755
Do some good again.

608
00:36:56.298 --> 00:36:57.591
I'm sure.

609
00:36:59.635 --> 00:37:01.929
I'll let you know if I
can use your help Brynner.

610
00:37:02.304 --> 00:37:04.306
But right now just
go back to your life

611
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.933
and I'll keep you posted.

612
00:37:06.642 --> 00:37:07.934
As for you, Hilts,

613
00:37:07.935 --> 00:37:10.019
I need you on the
Woolsey Street shooting.

614
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.520
Sir, Kamstock's
got that covered.

615
00:37:11.521 --> 00:37:13.231
I want you focused on it.

616
00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:16.485
Don't sweat it, guys.

617
00:37:16.777 --> 00:37:18.027
He's a strong one.

618
00:37:18.028 --> 00:37:20.280
This may look as
shitty as it gets but

619
00:37:20.656 --> 00:37:22.573
Johansen has a few lives left.

620
00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:23.574
I know it.

621
00:37:27.663 --> 00:37:28.663
Ugh.

622
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.790
Uh.

623
00:37:31.041 --> 00:37:32.542
Thanks Wolfman.

624
00:37:51.687 --> 00:37:53.814
Mama te va a traer
comida en la mañana.

625
00:37:54.982 --> 00:37:55.982
Food.

626
00:37:57.567 --> 00:37:58.902
Gracias.

627
00:38:21.717 --> 00:38:23.719
Aqui tengo su medicina.

628
00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:27.347
Bueno mija no te quedes
mucho tiempo con el.

629
00:38:37.733 --> 00:38:38.734
Here.

630
00:38:39.568 --> 00:38:41.027
It's okay, I don't need them.

631
00:38:41.028 --> 00:38:42.028
Take it.

632
00:38:46.575 --> 00:38:49.410
So, whoever came
after you yesterday,

633
00:38:49.411 --> 00:38:50.411
us,

634
00:38:51.413 --> 00:38:53.789
had enough money to
pay off local police.

635
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.876
That means cartel, traficantes.

636
00:38:56.835 --> 00:38:58.878
Alright well let me
make one phone call

637
00:38:58.879 --> 00:39:01.088
and I'll bring some help
from the U.S. down here.

638
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:03.883
Don't worry about it your
family's going to be fine.

639
00:39:03.884 --> 00:39:05.926
You get me out of
these cuffs all right?

640
00:39:05.927 --> 00:39:07.095
I don't have the key.

641
00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:09.096
Ahh.

642
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:10.682
That's bullshit.

643
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.852
I won't be coming back with you.

644
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:15.937
I just want you to know.

645
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:18.065
You are, like it or not.

646
00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:19.941
You don't get it, do you?

647
00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:22.611
Who do you think is
trying to kill us?

648
00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:30.660
Kill you, you mean. You clearly
know how to piss people off.

649
00:39:31.787 --> 00:39:33.037
Well like it or not,

650
00:39:33.038 --> 00:39:35.790
they're now trying to kill you
too if you haven't noticed.

651
00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:38.085
I saw what happened that
night and they know it.

652
00:39:39.753 --> 00:39:41.671
The night of the DEA murders.

653
00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:45.800
All right, so you saw some

654
00:39:45.801 --> 00:39:48.553
cartel guys that now
want you dead, too.

655
00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:50.138
Not cartel.

656
00:39:50.972 --> 00:39:52.140
They were cops.

657
00:39:52.808 --> 00:39:54.559
American cops.

658
00:39:56.144 --> 00:39:58.187
I'm sorry, but coming
from someone who hands up

659
00:39:58.188 --> 00:40:01.775
blowjobs for a living that's
a tough one to swallow.

660
00:40:02.567 --> 00:40:03.902
No pun intended.

661
00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:05.820
Fuck you.

662
00:40:06.822 --> 00:40:07.822
Hey.

663
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:09.157
Hey wait I'm sorry.

664
00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:11.034
I'm sorry.

665
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:15.831
So what did you see that
makes you think they were...

666
00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:18.667
American police?

667
00:40:20.919 --> 00:40:22.129
I heard them.

668
00:40:24.673 --> 00:40:26.132
The masked men

669
00:40:26.133 --> 00:40:27.759
recognized the DEA agent.

670
00:40:29.052 --> 00:40:30.720
<i>Eyes down.</i>

671
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:32.848
<i>Eyes down.</i>

672
00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:36.016
<i>It's me, it's Kahane.
We're DEA. We're DEA!</i>

673
00:40:36.017 --> 00:40:37.269
And then they shot him.

674
00:40:44.192 --> 00:40:45.734
<i>Jesus Fucking Christ.</i>

675
00:40:45.735 --> 00:40:47.903
<i>- What did you do that for?
- He recognized me.</i>

676
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:49.697
<i>We used to work together.</i>

677
00:40:49.698 --> 00:40:50.991
He said they worked together.

678
00:40:51.825 --> 00:40:52.868
So,

679
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.580
if they were cops then
who's after you, us?

680
00:40:56.872 --> 00:40:58.873
Well we got picked
up for shoplifting

681
00:40:58.874 --> 00:41:02.043
so, someone must have tipped
off the cartel where to find us.

682
00:41:03.628 --> 00:41:04.588
Okay,

683
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:05.796
well somehow I'll deal with it

684
00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:08.340
but just let me
make a phone call.

685
00:41:08.341 --> 00:41:09.925
It's dangerous.

686
00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:13.305
The longer we're here the more
danger for your family, for you.

687
00:41:13.889 --> 00:41:14.889
Everyone.

688
00:41:15.807 --> 00:41:16.975
I'll think about it.

689
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.646
Trust me, I was far from
interested in coming back here.

690
00:41:22.898 --> 00:41:24.940
This is my cousin
Salvador's place.

691
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:26.859
I can't even go back
to my own village.

692
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.736
They'd be looking for me there.

693
00:41:28.737 --> 00:41:29.905
Why come back?

694
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:34.326
I guess I could have left you
on the side of the road to die.

695
00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:36.619
Well it's a tough
choice between that

696
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.873
and being chained up
watching Spanish novelas.

697
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:06.107
See, I told you...

698
00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:09.027
bad husband.

699
00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:11.570
No buen hombre.

700
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:13.615
Dices bien, es muy mal hombre.

701
00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:14.949
Mhm.

702
00:42:15.116 --> 00:42:16.116
Mama.

703
00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:18.035
Cómo te sientes?

704
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:19.621
Estoy muy cansada, mija.

705
00:42:20.121 --> 00:42:21.163
Descanse.

706
00:42:21.164 --> 00:42:22.164
Okay.

707
00:42:33.176 --> 00:42:34.970
If I go back with you...

708
00:42:36.846 --> 00:42:38.223
will they really protect me?

709
00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:40.975
You want me to bring
you back to the States?

710
00:42:40.976 --> 00:42:42.101
Yes,

711
00:42:42.102 --> 00:42:43.603
but keep your voice down.

712
00:42:43.853 --> 00:42:44.980
Okay, yeah.

713
00:42:46.147 --> 00:42:47.773
Witness protection
is a real thing

714
00:42:47.774 --> 00:42:49.984
but you have to have
information they want.

715
00:42:49.985 --> 00:42:51.193
I do.

716
00:42:51.194 --> 00:42:53.237
Okay, get me out of
these cuffs and...

717
00:42:53.238 --> 00:42:54.447
I'll take you back.

718
00:42:54.698 --> 00:42:55.698
It's not up to me.

719
00:42:56.741 --> 00:42:57.908
Who is it up to?

720
00:42:57.909 --> 00:42:58.910
My brother.

721
00:43:08.586 --> 00:43:10.672
Call someone to come pick us up.

722
00:43:18.179 --> 00:43:19.973
Miguel's not gonna like this.

723
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:21.975
He'll like us dead even less.

724
00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:27.438
Chief, it's Johansen.

725
00:43:27.439 --> 00:43:29.023
He's on the line from Mexico.

726
00:43:29.024 --> 00:43:30.024
Thanks.

727
00:43:30.859 --> 00:43:32.902
Johansen, where the
holy hell are you?

728
00:43:33.695 --> 00:43:35.112
<i>I'm okay.</i>

729
00:43:35.113 --> 00:43:37.198
And our star witness
Rosa is alive and well.

730
00:43:37.991 --> 00:43:40.368
But we need to get out of
here. We need help to do it.

731
00:43:40.744 --> 00:43:42.703
All right, what
city are you near?

732
00:43:42.704 --> 00:43:44.039
<i>La Linea, right?</i>

733
00:43:45.081 --> 00:43:46.332
Yeah, it's uh,

734
00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:48.709
say a few hours away from
the prison we picked them up.

735
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.669
<i>There's a U.S.
consulate in Nogales.</i>

736
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.463
<i>I'll let them know
you two are coming in.</i>

737
00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:54.840
FBI's already down there
with Mexican federal police.

738
00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:56.717
There's some serious
shit coming down.

739
00:43:56.718 --> 00:43:58.594
They could lock you
up for twenty years.

740
00:43:58.595 --> 00:44:00.220
<i>So get to that consulate.</i>

741
00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:01.847
Okay we'll get there safe.

742
00:44:01.848 --> 00:44:03.016
Listen one thing...

743
00:44:04.476 --> 00:44:07.854
she's convinced the shooters
in Silverado County were cops.

744
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:11.231
Excuse me?

745
00:44:11.232 --> 00:44:12.734
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

746
00:44:13.193 --> 00:44:14.234
American cops.

747
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:16.278
She seems pretty
sure of herself.

748
00:44:16.279 --> 00:44:17.321
<i>One of ours?</i>

749
00:44:17.322 --> 00:44:19.490
Well, she said she
heard them and I...

750
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:20.950
tend to believe her.

751
00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:23.912
Chief?

752
00:44:23.913 --> 00:44:25.162
<i>Just what we need right now</i>

753
00:44:25.163 --> 00:44:27.790
hard enough time fighting the
bad guys now we have to fight

754
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:29.876
the general public
and fucking IA?

755
00:44:30.126 --> 00:44:31.251
<i>Just hang tight.</i>

756
00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:33.003
- Let me think about this.
- Rosa,

757
00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:34.254
ven a comer.

758
00:44:34.255 --> 00:44:35.631
<i>All right, I'll call
you again tomorrow</i>

759
00:44:35.632 --> 00:44:37.174
<i>or the day after, alright?</i>

760
00:44:37.175 --> 00:44:38.967
Yeah okay. We'll work it out.

761
00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:40.177
I gotta go.

762
00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:41.429
<i>Johansen one more thing...</i>

763
00:44:46.893 --> 00:44:48.019
Lunch.

764
00:44:48.937 --> 00:44:49.937
Es para ti.

765
00:44:49.938 --> 00:44:51.064
Ven con nosotros.

766
00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:55.943
Padre te agradecemos
por nuestros alimentos

767
00:44:55.944 --> 00:44:58.112
por favor protegenos siempre.

768
00:44:58.113 --> 00:45:00.572
Y por favor ayudanos a
salir con bien de esto.

769
00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:02.992
- Amen.
- Amen.

770
00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:15.755
Rosa...

771
00:45:16.297 --> 00:45:18.341
preguntale que si
le gusta la comida.

772
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.096
You like our food?

773
00:45:23.847 --> 00:45:24.847
Oh yeah.

774
00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:28.643
Do you know what
'queso de puerco' is?

775
00:45:29.519 --> 00:45:31.771
Okay yeah. Yeah, I like cheese.

776
00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:39.112
What kind of 'queso' is it?

777
00:45:40.488 --> 00:45:41.488
Dile.

778
00:45:41.489 --> 00:45:42.740
It's uhm...

779
00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:43.949
head cheese.

780
00:45:44.284 --> 00:45:45.743
Brains.

781
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:49.831
No, no, no, it's
from the pig's head.

782
00:45:50.957 --> 00:45:52.417
Well I guess that's better.

783
00:45:53.918 --> 00:45:55.085
Rosa...

784
00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:56.406
quiero que me
traduzcas por favor.

785
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.298
Dile que lamento que
nos este acompañando

786
00:45:59.299 --> 00:46:01.092
bajo estas circumstancias

787
00:46:01.551 --> 00:46:03.052
me gustaria que fuera diferente

788
00:46:03.845 --> 00:46:06.889
pero que todos estamos muy
agradecidos por salvarte

789
00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:07.890
gracias.

790
00:46:08.183 --> 00:46:09.558
He said that

791
00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:12.937
you're a guest here but that he
apologizes for the circumstances

792
00:46:13.438 --> 00:46:16.149
and that they're all very
grateful for saving me.

793
00:46:18.067 --> 00:46:19.067
Yes.

794
00:46:19.903 --> 00:46:20.903
A guest.

795
00:46:24.157 --> 00:46:26.868
Hice lo que tuve que hacer
para salvarles a los dos

796
00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:29.537
asi como usted yo
tambien soy policia.

797
00:46:31.164 --> 00:46:32.164
Hey...

798
00:46:32.624 --> 00:46:34.583
there are bad cops here

799
00:46:34.584 --> 00:46:36.044
and in the States, too.

800
00:46:37.003 --> 00:46:38.129
My brother's honest.

801
00:46:38.588 --> 00:46:40.048
Ya le dijiste lo del cartel?

802
00:46:40.298 --> 00:46:41.882
He told me earlier
that those cops

803
00:46:41.883 --> 00:46:43.550
were paid by the Sinaloa cartel

804
00:46:43.551 --> 00:46:44.885
to kill me and my friend.

805
00:46:44.886 --> 00:46:46.970
Well it sounds like
you're in a bad spot

806
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.848
but it's got nothing
to do with me.

807
00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:52.142
And yet,

808
00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:53.894
you're the one
wanted for murder.

809
00:46:53.895 --> 00:46:54.854
What?

810
00:46:54.855 --> 00:46:58.232
They said you killed the federal
and the two Mexican cops.

811
00:46:58.233 --> 00:47:01.152
The authorities are looking for
you. It's all over the news.

812
00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:04.948
Then why am I sitting
at a policeman's table

813
00:47:05.573 --> 00:47:07.158
having lunch with his family?

814
00:47:10.119 --> 00:47:12.288
Why am I cuffed to a damn bed?

815
00:47:14.457 --> 00:47:15.457
Huh.

816
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:18.878
La familia es todo.

817
00:47:19.087 --> 00:47:20.337
Family is everything.

818
00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:22.756
Dile que cuando se siente
mejor lo llevo a la frontera.

819
00:47:22.757 --> 00:47:23.966
Por lo pronto se queda aqui

820
00:47:23.967 --> 00:47:25.384
que hay mucha gente
buscandolo fuera.

821
00:47:25.385 --> 00:47:27.761
He said when you're healthy
he'll take you to the States

822
00:47:27.762 --> 00:47:29.471
but until then you
have to hide inside

823
00:47:29.472 --> 00:47:30.889
because we're all
dead if you don't.

824
00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:34.602
- There are spies everywhere.
- Okay, okay but what about her?

825
00:47:38.523 --> 00:47:39.648
Ella se queda

826
00:47:39.649 --> 00:47:40.858
aqui.

827
00:47:42.485 --> 00:47:43.610
He said I stay here.

828
00:47:43.611 --> 00:47:45.530
No, I can't do that.

829
00:47:46.573 --> 00:47:47.949
I came down to get her.

830
00:47:48.491 --> 00:47:51.535
She can help solve who
killed those DEA agents.

831
00:47:51.536 --> 00:47:53.120
In America, we can protect...

832
00:47:53.121 --> 00:47:54.247
No you can't!

833
00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.961
Salvador.

834
00:48:00.712 --> 00:48:02.589
Let's give our guest some time

835
00:48:02.839 --> 00:48:05.258
to think about all his options.

836
00:48:06.634 --> 00:48:07.634
Go.

837
00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:09.720
- Ahora.
- We should talk about this.

838
00:48:09.721 --> 00:48:10.972
This is bullshit.

839
00:48:11.723 --> 00:48:12.974
Agh.

840
00:48:13.182 --> 00:48:15.101
You're making a
huge mistake, buddy.

841
00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:19.230
What's wrong with this country?

842
00:48:27.322 --> 00:48:28.281
Miguel?

843
00:48:28.281 --> 00:48:29.281
Hmm.

844
00:48:31.576 --> 00:48:33.161
I have to go back with him.

845
00:48:34.495 --> 00:48:35.495
No.

846
00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:37.915
I'll take him back...

847
00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:40.000
and he'll tell them you were

848
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:41.585
also shot on the road and died.

849
00:48:41.586 --> 00:48:42.711
But you're not going.

850
00:48:42.712 --> 00:48:44.213
They will find us here.

851
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:45.590
Think of mom.

852
00:48:46.299 --> 00:48:48.175
I have to go to
the United States.

853
00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.718
I want to go. You know that.

854
00:48:49.719 --> 00:48:51.219
They will find you, Rosa.

855
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:53.013
They're going to kill
you and make sure of it.

856
00:48:53.014 --> 00:48:53.723
Miguel.

857
00:48:53.724 --> 00:48:55.057
Why do you have to go?

858
00:48:55.058 --> 00:48:56.683
I knew when we brought this guy

859
00:48:56.684 --> 00:48:58.101
this was going to happen.

860
00:48:58.102 --> 00:49:00.563
- You want to go play or what?
- Miguel, stop!

861
00:49:02.023 --> 00:49:03.191
Everything will be okay.

862
00:49:13.201 --> 00:49:14.661
Salvador, come quick!

863
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.133
Fuck.

864
00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:31.635
- It's the Cartel.
- Listen!

865
00:49:31.636 --> 00:49:33.220
Take mom to the room. Quick!

866
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:35.556
We only want Rosa
and the American!

867
00:49:35.807 --> 00:49:37.475
The rest can go free!

868
00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:50.196
We don't have all day!

869
00:50:21.853 --> 00:50:23.270
You need to unlock me!

870
00:50:23.271 --> 00:50:25.606
I need the handcuff
keys back here!

871
00:50:26.482 --> 00:50:27.525
I need the keys!

872
00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:39.662
They're coming in to
the back over here!

873
00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:41.496
Hurry up!

874
00:50:41.873 --> 00:50:43.124
Salvador! GO!

875
00:50:54.177 --> 00:50:55.219
Behind you! Watch out!

876
00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:44.769
Ahh!

877
00:52:11.295 --> 00:52:12.296
Hey!

878
00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:17.551
You okay?

879
00:52:17.552 --> 00:52:18.636
Yes, yes. I'm good!

880
00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:23.683
Ahh shit.

881
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.018
They're coming to
the front door.

882
00:52:34.902 --> 00:52:36.237
Todo va a estar bien, Ma.

883
00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:56.883
You okay?

884
00:52:57.008 --> 00:52:58.258
You okay?

885
00:52:58.259 --> 00:52:59.259
Yes.

886
00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.761
- Stay down.
- Si okay.

887
00:53:23.743 --> 00:53:24.952
Damn it.

888
00:53:32.585 --> 00:53:34.045
Se tiene que ir.

889
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:36.672
Los dos.

890
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:38.924
He said we got to go.

891
00:53:38.925 --> 00:53:39.926
Both of us.

892
00:53:40.593 --> 00:53:41.594
Way ahead of you.

893
00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.471
Thanks...

894
00:53:44.013 --> 00:53:45.056
for everything.

895
00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:50.978
Mom... no.

896
00:53:51.687 --> 00:53:53.564
- You deserve it.
- No sweetheart.

897
00:53:54.649 --> 00:53:56.733
It's yours, take it.

898
00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:57.734
Take it.

899
00:53:57.902 --> 00:53:59.320
You're going to need it.

900
00:54:01.822 --> 00:54:02.907
My princess.

901
00:54:03.324 --> 00:54:04.659
I love you so much mom.

902
00:54:15.336 --> 00:54:17.546
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

903
00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:21.716
Go.

904
00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:29.684
Esto es nuestra
señora de Guadalupe.

905
00:54:30.059 --> 00:54:31.851
Thats our lady of Guadalupe.

906
00:54:31.852 --> 00:54:33.771
She's a symbol of our identity

907
00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:36.607
and also of social
justice and femininity.

908
00:54:37.149 --> 00:54:38.984
Great. My favorites.

909
00:54:38.985 --> 00:54:41.861
Si quieres pelear con los
lobos tienes que ser un lobo.

910
00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:43.698
If you want to fight
with the wolves...

911
00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:45.032
you got to be a wolf.

912
00:54:45.533 --> 00:54:46.534
I know.

913
00:54:46.993 --> 00:54:47.993
Gracias.

914
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:52.956
Mija.

915
00:54:52.957 --> 00:54:54.375
Mi princesa.

916
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:59.463
Gotta go.

917
00:56:18.626 --> 00:56:19.919
What are you doing?

918
00:56:21.253 --> 00:56:22.587
Calling my boss, telling him

919
00:56:22.588 --> 00:56:24.005
we're skipping his
fed chaperones.

920
00:56:24.006 --> 00:56:25.673
Going with your connections.

921
00:56:25.674 --> 00:56:27.008
Coyotes, right?

922
00:56:27.009 --> 00:56:29.177
Every time you call that
fucking guy someone tries to

923
00:56:29.178 --> 00:56:31.179
come and kill us. Are
you stupid or something?

924
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:33.306
I'm sorry, I've known him
for twenty five years Rosa.

925
00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:35.308
Then how do you explain
what happened at my house

926
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:36.810
when you called him?

927
00:56:36.811 --> 00:56:38.394
My cousin is dead!

928
00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:42.357
- I can't. I can't. I'm sorry
- My cousin is dead! He's dead!

929
00:56:42.358 --> 00:56:44.068
Okay, okay. Calm
down. Calm down.

930
00:56:45.111 --> 00:56:48.154
And my mom almost died
and Miguel's hurt.

931
00:56:48.155 --> 00:56:49.657
I'm sorry about Salvador.

932
00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:51.575
He was a good man.

933
00:56:51.992 --> 00:56:52.993
All right.

934
00:56:53.828 --> 00:56:54.994
Okay?

935
00:56:54.995 --> 00:56:55.995
You okay?

936
00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.790
All right.

937
00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:04.130
So who do you know that you
trust that you can call?

938
00:57:08.259 --> 00:57:09.426
There's this...

939
00:57:09.718 --> 00:57:11.554
There's this old buddy
of mine, Brynner.

940
00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:13.013
He's a tough guy.

941
00:57:13.848 --> 00:57:14.849
Yeah I trust him.

942
00:57:15.683 --> 00:57:18.936
So call him and tell him to come
and get us when we cross, okay?

943
00:57:20.688 --> 00:57:21.856
Okay.

944
00:57:29.196 --> 00:57:30.697
Over there.

945
00:57:30.698 --> 00:57:31.699
Keep going.

946
00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:55.264
Is it set up?

947
00:57:55.514 --> 00:57:56.848
He said they'll take
us to the border

948
00:57:56.849 --> 00:57:58.559
and then we're on our own.

949
00:57:58.851 --> 00:58:00.602
Tell your friend he
can pick us up there.

950
00:58:00.603 --> 00:58:02.479
We leave tomorrow at midnight.

951
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:08.151
<i>Remember call me
when you get across.</i>

952
00:58:08.152 --> 00:58:09.069
That's right.

953
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:10.987
<i>You hang in there.
I'll get you home soon.</i>

954
00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:12.156
Yeah, I know.

955
00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:14.783
We'll be here till then.

956
00:58:16.243 --> 00:58:17.620
Hey, Brynner.

957
00:58:17.953 --> 00:58:19.079
<i>Yeah?</i>

958
00:58:19.705 --> 00:58:20.706
Thanks, buddy.

959
00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:22.833
<i>No sweat.</i>

960
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.215
You hungry?

961
00:58:29.882 --> 00:58:31.925
I know a place that
still delivers.

962
00:58:31.926 --> 00:58:32.968
Okay.

963
00:58:34.345 --> 00:58:36.096
My mother's money came in handy.

964
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.058
The coyotes charged
us $4,000 each.

965
00:58:42.603 --> 00:58:43.896
That's a lot of money.

966
00:58:44.396 --> 00:58:46.190
Bringing people across
is big business.

967
00:58:48.108 --> 00:58:49.109
Thanks.

968
00:58:49.693 --> 00:58:51.946
Well I always pay back my debts.

969
00:58:52.196 --> 00:58:53.197
Hmm.

970
00:58:55.199 --> 00:58:56.450
You're welcome...

971
00:58:57.785 --> 00:58:59.245
Johansen.

972
00:59:02.748 --> 00:59:04.041
Mike.

973
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.919
My name is Mike.

974
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:08.837
You're welcome, Mike.

975
00:59:11.257 --> 00:59:12.465
You have a family?

976
00:59:12.466 --> 00:59:14.968
Got married twice, divorced
twice, and that's it.

977
00:59:14.969 --> 00:59:15.969
Oh, no kids.

978
00:59:16.971 --> 00:59:18.138
End of story.

979
00:59:20.683 --> 00:59:22.892
<i>The police are still
looking for the pair</i>

980
00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:23.977
<i>along Highway 1.</i>

981
00:59:23.978 --> 00:59:26.020
<i>Officials say
Johansen and Barranco</i>

982
00:59:26.021 --> 00:59:29.358
<i>are armed and very dangerous.</i>

983
00:59:37.616 --> 00:59:38.617
Hey.

984
00:59:47.876 --> 00:59:49.586
You miss your home?

985
00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:52.131
Do I miss my home?

986
00:59:53.007 --> 00:59:54.717
Yeah, I guess.

987
00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.014
My best friend,

988
01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.223
she grew up watching her

989
01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.767
mother and her grandmother

990
01:00:04.768 --> 01:00:06.603
go from nothing to nowhere.

991
01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:09.148
Just living a life
of struggle and pain.

992
01:00:12.818 --> 01:00:16.155
But she knew a place where
everyone had a chance.

993
01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:18.866
America.

994
01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:23.037
She paid a coyote
group to get us across.

995
01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:26.873
And she had a cousin in
Los Angeles who would

996
01:00:26.874 --> 01:00:28.834
raise me and put
me through school.

997
01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:33.047
But she never set
foot on American soil.

998
01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:36.216
She died a hundred yards
away from her dream for me.

999
01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:41.429
With two fat, slobbering
coyote scumbags

1000
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.057
breathing down her face.

1001
01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:46.060
And I got away before they
could do the same to me.

1002
01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:50.397
So at sixteen...

1003
01:00:52.358 --> 01:00:53.983
I lived on the streets...

1004
01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.069
undocumented.

1005
01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.655
And you learn some things there.

1006
01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:01.200
Some things you
shouldn't have to learn.

1007
01:01:03.035 --> 01:01:05.036
But I survived the States.

1008
01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:06.205
I stayed alive.

1009
01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:09.208
And I know I can do it again.

1010
01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.169
Well, I'm sure you can.

1011
01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:15.422
Look, it's late.

1012
01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:17.424
Let's get some sleep.

1013
01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:57.171
Yeah?

1014
01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:59.424
Any dumb ass cop in
there who want a ride

1015
01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:01.467
back to the land of the free?

1016
01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:02.552
Hilts?

1017
01:02:02.553 --> 01:02:03.887
Don't shoot me, big guy.

1018
01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:09.308
Fuckin' Mexico, man.

1019
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:11.144
I've been telling
you since I saw...

1020
01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:12.145
Hey!

1021
01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:13.564
Hey!

1022
01:02:13.565 --> 01:02:14.731
Ahh fu...

1023
01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.066
Are you packing?

1024
01:02:16.275 --> 01:02:17.275
No!

1025
01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:18.402
Okay, turn around.

1026
01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:23.824
Glad to see we're
still good friends.

1027
01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:25.492
How'd you know I was here?

1028
01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:27.368
Hernandez?

1029
01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.871
Your heart felt call to an old
buddy traced back to a village

1030
01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:32.123
about eight miles
down the highway.

1031
01:02:32.124 --> 01:02:34.209
Three hotels between
it and the great wall.

1032
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.170
Still got it.

1033
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:37.170
Alright.

1034
01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:39.006
So why in the hell are you here?

1035
01:02:39.882 --> 01:02:40.882
We.

1036
01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:51.225
Look, it's a shit show
back in the States.

1037
01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:53.394
Internal Affairs and
the FBI are all working

1038
01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:55.605
on coming down here
and grabbing you today.

1039
01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.857
We're thinking it's
best to do it this way.

1040
01:02:57.858 --> 01:02:59.901
No press, no bullshit,
nobody knows.

1041
01:02:59.902 --> 01:03:01.027
Just us.

1042
01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:04.030
But we're planning to go with
her contacts, the Coyotes,

1043
01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:05.157
tonight.

1044
01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:06.533
Hey man,

1045
01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.202
trusting's hard.

1046
01:03:09.036 --> 01:03:10.537
Knowing who to trust...

1047
01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:12.539
is even harder.

1048
01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.000
Hello, Miss.

1049
01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:16.292
I'm Hilts.

1050
01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:17.794
Old buddy of Mike's here.

1051
01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.004
Yeah,

1052
01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:21.298
he's with that guy
I called to meet us.

1053
01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:22.549
That's right,

1054
01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:23.967
Brought the old boys club.

1055
01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.552
Okay, so where are we crossing?

1056
01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:28.054
Close to where you came in.

1057
01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:30.891
So get yourselves ready and
meet us out back in five.

1058
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.309
Okay.

1059
01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.562
Good to have you back buddy.

1060
01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:37.230
- Hey Hilts...
- Yeah?

1061
01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:38.565
Thanks for sticking by me.

1062
01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:48.575
Alright, let's get out of
here while we still can.

1063
01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:59.419
Young lady, your chariot.

1064
01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:09.012
God, I've missed this work.

1065
01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:12.140
Let's roll, Chief.

1066
01:04:13.809 --> 01:04:15.477
Vacation's over, Johansen.

1067
01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.479
You look like hell, by the way.

1068
01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.357
- Good to see you, Brynner.
- Yeah, ha ha.

1069
01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.582
So many questions, my friend.

1070
01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:38.583
Oh-ho.

1071
01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.085
You okay? You feel all right?

1072
01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.378
Yeah, somewhat tired.

1073
01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.130
I got a 0.9mm
through and through

1074
01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:45.506
right by the spleen there,

1075
01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:47.509
and I need to have
it checked out.

1076
01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:50.304
Don't worry about it.
We'll take care of you.

1077
01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.098
Alright, which way home?

1078
01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.057
Left.

1079
01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.227
Okay, let's blow this pop stand.

1080
01:05:11.742 --> 01:05:12.950
Rosa...

1081
01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:15.662
surprised you got this far
with this guy helping you out.

1082
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.040
But...

1083
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.002
happy to finally have you.

1084
01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:28.008
Hard to believe I
am so willing...

1085
01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:31.010
to risk my ass to
be the one to bring

1086
01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:33.930
the fugitive Johansen back
across the Mexican border...

1087
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.183
illegally.

1088
01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:41.563
The irony, huh?

1089
01:05:43.023 --> 01:05:44.024
So, Joe...

1090
01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:46.026
how's your head?

1091
01:05:47.194 --> 01:05:49.029
Taking this all in okay?

1092
01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:53.116
Ready to put this mess
behind you and get back home?

1093
01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.995
Yeah, well, I'm ready
for a damn bath anyway.

1094
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.624
So which way are we going?

1095
01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.543
Pretty near the
regular crossing.

1096
01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:06.463
Got a couple of
amigos helping us out.

1097
01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:16.056
So tell me...

1098
01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:19.226
what does an aging
retired cop do for fun?

1099
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.561
Do you ever get bored?

1100
01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:22.854
Miss the chase?

1101
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.272
The control?

1102
01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:29.026
Is it hard to just let it all
go and become a normal nobody...

1103
01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.862
- cares about you civilian?
- Come on.

1104
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.199
Guess what?

1105
01:06:36.702 --> 01:06:38.787
Nobody cared about me before.

1106
01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.425
<i>There were two of them.</i>

1107
01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:54.803
<i>Let it go. Let's
blow this pop stand.</i>

1108
01:06:58.682 --> 01:06:59.933
<i>No, no, no!</i>

1109
01:07:12.988 --> 01:07:15.198
Si quieres pelear con los lobos

1110
01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.659
tiene que ser un lobo.

1111
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:22.581
What's that about a wolf?

1112
01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:25.751
Yeah.

1113
01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:29.212
If you want to fight the
wolves you gotta be a...

1114
01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:31.214
wolf.

1115
01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.468
The fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1116
01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:43.642
These are the wolves.

1117
01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:44.770
Trust me.

1118
01:08:12.172 --> 01:08:13.714
Hey Brynner...

1119
01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.674
can I talk to you for a second?

1120
01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:16.885
Yeah, sure.

1121
01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:21.181
- Outside.
- Oh.

1122
01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:23.891
Yeah okay, yeah.

1123
01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:25.393
Let's pull up over there.

1124
01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.714
Let's go down here.

1125
01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:09.688
Listen, I need to
ask you something.

1126
01:09:09.938 --> 01:09:10.897
Sure.

1127
01:09:10.898 --> 01:09:12.774
That night at the warehouse...

1128
01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:14.901
the DEA murders...

1129
01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.737
the killers may have been cops.

1130
01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:19.738
Cops?

1131
01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:20.739
Yeah.

1132
01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:21.575
Jesus you know...

1133
01:09:21.576 --> 01:09:23.659
We gotta get you to a
doc boss man, come on.

1134
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.369
- I was wondering...
- Let's get going.

1135
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:26.787
Maybe your twenty
something years

1136
01:09:26.788 --> 01:09:28.664
of being an outstanding
officer of the law

1137
01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.541
has a scent about all that.

1138
01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:31.585
An instinct or two.

1139
01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.752
Hey Joe, it's
getting hot out here.

1140
01:09:33.753 --> 01:09:34.920
I'm fucking retired.

1141
01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.755
They don't tell me shit anymore.

1142
01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.007
Come on what's the word fellas?

1143
01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.134
Joe's concerned that the
beauty queen may have told him

1144
01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:41.635
that there's some
police officers

1145
01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:43.262
involved in the
Silverado shooting.

1146
01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.515
- Cops? She told you that?
- Yeah.

1147
01:09:46.266 --> 01:09:48.268
What's going on? Did
someone get carsick?

1148
01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.525
Hey, this isn't
the place for this.

1149
01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:57.526
No.

1150
01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:58.612
No.

1151
01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.615
Actually, it's
the perfect place.

1152
01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:04.283
Give it up. Give up
your piece come on.

1153
01:10:04.284 --> 01:10:06.035
We're gonna have to
have a little chat.

1154
01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:07.287
Mike, give it to him.

1155
01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:09.705
Come on. Come on.

1156
01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:10.540
Okay.

1157
01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:12.791
Look, we're here
to save you, Joe.

1158
01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:15.294
That night was meant to
be an easy in and out.

1159
01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:16.837
No shots, no dead,

1160
01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:17.964
easy cash.

1161
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.633
We're gonna big 'fuck you'
to those cartel assholes

1162
01:10:20.634 --> 01:10:22.801
bringing their shit
poison into our country.

1163
01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:23.637
It is what it is.

1164
01:10:23.638 --> 01:10:25.596
Yeah, the DEA wasn't
supposed to be there.

1165
01:10:25.597 --> 01:10:27.556
We didn't know. We were
there for the money.

1166
01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.808
You know how it is these days
you make one shit mistake,

1167
01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:30.893
some asshole's down your throat

1168
01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:32.937
trying to defund you
and demoralize you.

1169
01:10:32.938 --> 01:10:35.147
Do we miss the body
cams and the TV? No.

1170
01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:37.816
But the rest of it, the
chase, the control, the power,

1171
01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:39.068
yeah, I miss it.

1172
01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:41.780
I do. We need it
Joe. You need it too.

1173
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.701
All right, we don't
have enough time.

1174
01:10:47.035 --> 01:10:48.495
Go get her.

1175
01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:02.007
- Ahh! No!
- Easy, easy, bitch.

1176
01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:03.259
No, no, no!

1177
01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.971
Don't fucking touch me!

1178
01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:08.013
Come on!

1179
01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:10.057
I wish to hell I'd made
that night disappear

1180
01:11:10.058 --> 01:11:11.725
but we can do that right now,

1181
01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:12.726
right here.

1182
01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:14.937
Look, we just take care
of her and we drive.

1183
01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.897
That's it, we just
drive away all right?

1184
01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:18.607
I'm sorry they sent you
down here for this Joe.

1185
01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:19.359
Okay.

1186
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.776
I've tried to talk the
chief out of it but...

1187
01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.277
It's too late for this,
we don't need this.

1188
01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.570
You dragged me across the border

1189
01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.406
just to leave me
here to fucking die?

1190
01:11:25.407 --> 01:11:26.949
I should have just stayed
with my mom and Miguel!

1191
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.033
Shut up!

1192
01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:29.159
Hey, wait.

1193
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.953
- Stupid bitch.
- Wait listen.

1194
01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:32.663
Please don't let them kill me.

1195
01:11:32.664 --> 01:11:34.124
There's gotta be another way.

1196
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:36.710
The girl's gotta go.

1197
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:38.335
Easy, Chief.

1198
01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:39.545
What are you doing?

1199
01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:41.046
He's coming back with
us. We talked about this.

1200
01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.798
You gotta let her go Joe.

1201
01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.466
Let's let this Mexican
shit hole flush itself

1202
01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.177
and we'll all get
the hell back home.

1203
01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:47.804
What do you say?

1204
01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:49.764
Let her go, Joe.

1205
01:11:54.394 --> 01:11:55.729
Or do we dig two graves?

1206
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.855
- Brynner I'm talking to you!
- What the fuck!

1207
01:11:57.856 --> 01:12:00.274
Calm the fuck down! What
the hell's wrong with you.

1208
01:12:00.275 --> 01:12:02.115
- Don't do this!
- You outta your fucking mind?

1209
01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:07.072
Uh!

1210
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:09.908
What the fuck.

1211
01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:11.036
Fuck.

1212
01:12:17.751 --> 01:12:19.334
Joe, wait a minute.

1213
01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.713
Come on, man. Don't.
Gimme a break here man.

1214
01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:24.132
Agh!

1215
01:12:58.083 --> 01:12:59.751
You fucking bitch!

1216
01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:21.981
Stay down!

1217
01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:46.464
Oh fuck.

1218
01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:52.220
Sorry.

1219
01:14:02.856 --> 01:14:04.190
Fucking Mexico.

1220
01:14:37.599 --> 01:14:38.600
Okay.

1221
01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:04.541
You okay?

1222
01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:05.543
Yeah.

1223
01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:08.922
Here, take this.

1224
01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:14.719
We leave at midnight.

1225
01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:24.139
Muchachos lo hicimos!

1226
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.142
Lo hicimos! Felicidades!

1227
01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.224
Thanks.

1228
01:18:51.102 --> 01:18:52.061
Alright.

1229
01:18:52.062 --> 01:18:53.146
- Congrats.
- Thanks, man.

1230
01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:56.774
Feels good, doesn't it?

1231
01:18:57.150 --> 01:18:58.401
What's that?

1232
01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:00.153
When the crap ends.

1233
01:19:01.279 --> 01:19:02.279
Yeah.

1234
01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.280
Pretty good.

1235
01:19:03.281 --> 01:19:05.365
Hey, better when they love
you than when they hate you,

1236
01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:06.534
you gotta admit.

1237
01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:08.995
Can't argue there.

1238
01:19:09.287 --> 01:19:10.830
Ha ha Johansen.

1239
01:19:11.164 --> 01:19:13.248
There wasn't much
future left for you

1240
01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:15.917
and somehow you found
it you son of a bitch.

1241
01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:17.837
Commendations and all.

1242
01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:20.464
Thankfully,

1243
01:19:20.465 --> 01:19:21.883
the rest of the guys, well...

1244
01:19:23.009 --> 01:19:24.176
they deserve to just be

1245
01:19:24.177 --> 01:19:25.511
forgotten.

1246
01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.055
And they will be.

1247
01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:30.057
That's right.

1248
01:19:31.184 --> 01:19:33.560
I still got a lot of work to
clean up in the department

1249
01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:36.522
but at least you're no longer
the monster in the closet.

1250
01:19:37.732 --> 01:19:38.816
Keep it that way.

1251
01:19:39.609 --> 01:19:40.902
No problem.

1252
01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:46.615
Oh well, well.

1253
01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:48.450
Must have been months
since you two didn't have

1254
01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.369
nineteen lawyers between you.

1255
01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:52.245
Go ahead.

1256
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.167
Thanks boss.

1257
01:19:59.879 --> 01:20:01.047
Ugh.

1258
01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:07.136
Hi.

1259
01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:08.303
Hi.

1260
01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:11.139
Nice speech in there.

1261
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.140
Oh, really?

1262
01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:13.308
Meh.

1263
01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:14.894
Good enough.

1264
01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:19.606
Look, I tried to contact you
but they wouldn't let me.

1265
01:20:19.607 --> 01:20:21.484
With all the stupid legal stuff.

1266
01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:23.694
I know.

1267
01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:25.571
So,

1268
01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:27.240
how do you feel, Mr...

1269
01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:30.493
Medal of Honor police man?

1270
01:20:31.077 --> 01:20:32.411
Like Swiss cheese.

1271
01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:35.414
Two more surgeries. Still
have to fix the ankle.

1272
01:20:36.624 --> 01:20:38.876
Fallen apart. What can I say?

1273
01:20:39.377 --> 01:20:42.587
Well, you look
better in pieces than

1274
01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:44.631
most men do, put together.

1275
01:20:44.632 --> 01:20:46.884
Really? Thanks.

1276
01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:49.595
I mean, you're...
You look very...

1277
01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:52.055
Pretty?

1278
01:20:52.682 --> 01:20:55.225
I mean I don't want to put
words in your mouth, but...

1279
01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:57.520
Yeah, I was going to
say something like that.

1280
01:20:58.062 --> 01:20:59.188
So, how are you doing?

1281
01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:00.939
Well,

1282
01:21:01.232 --> 01:21:04.025
the DA cut me a
pretty sweet deal so

1283
01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:08.155
I'm now on my way to becoming
an official U.S. citizen.

1284
01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:10.115
Really?

1285
01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:11.117
Great.

1286
01:21:11.284 --> 01:21:13.034
- Yeah.
- Ha ha.

1287
01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.913
Well, that's,
that's great, yeah.

1288
01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:17.582
Well you deserve it.

1289
01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:20.626
You know, maybe I'll, um...

1290
01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:23.004
Maybe I'll see you around.

1291
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.006
Maybe you will.

1292
01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.093
Yeah. Okay.

1293
01:21:35.141 --> 01:21:36.517
All right.

1294
01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:40.646
See you around.

1295
01:21:49.322 --> 01:21:50.990
Hey, Rosa?

1296
01:21:54.452 --> 01:21:56.203
You like American coffee?

1297
01:21:57.663 --> 01:21:59.040
It's the best.

1298
01:22:01.334 --> 01:22:02.627
I know a place.
