Northern Mongolia

27
00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:41.936
Get off the babysitter.

28
00:01:41.962 --> 00:01:43.410
Daddy's home.

29
00:02:20.502 --> 00:02:24.379
What is an Angel doing so far from Heaven?

30
00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:34.013
l'm no Angel.

31
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.042
This is hostel, yeah?

32
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:52.791
l'm good at the bull, no?

Ray Carter
U.S. Marshal

34
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.852
Marshal Ray Carter?

35
00:04:44.878 --> 00:04:45.910
l'm Alex Munday.

36
00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:47.740
l'll be your rescuer today.

37
00:04:47.882 --> 00:04:49.524
l didn't think you'd find me.

38
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.077
How many men do you have?

39
00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.345
l've got two girlfriends in the bar.

40
00:04:53.512 --> 00:04:55.139
They have 50 armed men.

41
00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:58.600
l know. lt hardly seems fair.
Come on.

42
00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:04.147
-What is it?
-My ribs.

43
00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:06.691
Dylan?
Dylan, we need to get out of here.

44
00:05:06.857 --> 00:05:08.359
l'm on top of it.

45
00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:20.343
They got my ring.

46
00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:23.273
l'm sure your wife will understand.

47
00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:38.718
Kill them!

48
00:05:39.302 --> 00:05:40.888
Kill them all!

49
00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.594
Plan B.

50
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.326
Just once, l'd like to walk out of a bar.

51
00:07:12.594 --> 00:07:14.054
Let's go!

52
00:07:30.818 --> 00:07:32.111
Now!

53
00:07:55.006 --> 00:07:57.300
-Get in!
-You got him?

54
00:08:04.807 --> 00:08:05.808
Dylan!

55
00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:09.019
Go for it!

56
00:08:09.228 --> 00:08:11.188
-Dylan!
-l'm trying!

57
00:08:20.862 --> 00:08:23.865
l'm afraid l underestimated you guys.

58
00:08:24.032 --> 00:08:25.200
Yeah.

59
00:08:25.409 --> 00:08:27.743
That happens a lot.

60
00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:53.600
lt was three girls!

61
00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:55.518
Three crazy beautiful girls.

62
00:08:55.686 --> 00:08:56.769
But we have the ring.

63
00:08:57.438 --> 00:08:59.814
l always knew this day would come...

64
00:09:00.398 --> 00:09:02.692
Let's go to plan B.

65
00:09:06.027 --> 00:09:10.073
Once upon a time, there were three very different little girls.

66
00:09:25.837 --> 00:09:26.838
Come on, Alex. This is the last pass.
You can do it!

67
00:09:26.838 --> 00:09:28.759
Come on, Alex.
This is the last pass.

68
00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:29.616
You can do it!

69
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.219
Harder! Harder! Harder!

70
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.987
l want you!
 l want you now!

71
00:09:55.155 --> 00:09:59.158
who grew up to be three very different women.

72
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.202
No.

73
00:10:24.515 --> 00:10:25.557
Okay.

74
00:10:33.813 --> 00:10:35.858
You, hot water.

75
00:10:36.983 --> 00:10:39.027
Here it goes. Here it goes.

76
00:10:42.197 --> 00:10:43.240
There we go.

77
00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:45.679
Now they work for me.

78
00:10:45.706 --> 00:10:47.977
My name is Charlie.

79
00:11:45.586 --> 00:11:47.963
William Rose Bailey Department of Justice

80
00:11:56.804 --> 00:11:57.827
Perimeter secure.

81
00:11:57.853 --> 00:11:59.415
We're ready for takeoff.

82
00:11:59.599 --> 00:12:02.059
Well done, Agent McDowell.

83
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.123
Hey, check this out.

84
00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:04.251
Our first piece of mail.

85
00:14:11.298 --> 00:14:13.526
Your 10-year high-school reunion.

86
00:14:13.553 --> 00:14:15.578
lt'll be a fun night, Nat.

87
00:14:15.719 --> 00:14:18.096
-lsn't that cool?
-lt's great.

88
00:14:19.597 --> 00:14:22.933
l still can't believe Nat and Pete are moving in together.

89
00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:24.616
Our little Angel's growing up.

90
00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:26.712
lt's wild that Natalie owns property.

91
00:14:26.854 --> 00:14:29.189
The most expensive thing l own are these boots.

92
00:14:29.356 --> 00:14:31.068
Excuse me.
Those are my boots.

93
00:14:31.094 --> 00:14:32.634
Whatever. My point is--

94
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.738
l forgot my point.

95
00:14:38.906 --> 00:14:41.117
You're broke, horny and wearing my boots.

96
00:14:41.283 --> 00:14:43.202
Thank you.

97
00:14:47.497 --> 00:14:51.125
So you thought you could escape my fortress.

98
00:14:51.293 --> 00:14:52.919
Not so fast.

99
00:14:56.922 --> 00:15:00.551
-Oh, my God! Jason.
-Surprise.

100
00:15:00.717 --> 00:15:03.804
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

101
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.638
That was fun.

102
00:15:05.805 --> 00:15:07.639
Fun. Yeah.

103
00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:11.056
What are you doing here?

104
00:15:11.082 --> 00:15:13.295
l miss you. Look--

105
00:15:16.647 --> 00:15:19.817
What are you doing later, after this?
Later on?

106
00:15:21.611 --> 00:15:24.947
Jason, l thought we were on a time-out.

107
00:15:25.114 --> 00:15:28.159
What? We can't fool around at all?

108
00:15:28.325 --> 00:15:31.660
Hey, Jason.
l didn't think you'd make it.

109
00:15:31.828 --> 00:15:33.518
Yeah, the photo shoot ran late.

110
00:15:33.544 --> 00:15:35.941
Plus, l wanted to miss all the heavy stuff.

111
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:38.001
-Hey, Jason.
-Hey.

112
00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:40.127
-How's the sequel going?
-Great.

113
00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:43.506
We had, like, 13 writers, so it should be pretty good.

114
00:15:43.671 --> 00:15:45.079
l loved the first one.

115
00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:46.575
Yeah, it was great.

116
00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:52.764
Sorry. We got a great title for this one: Maximum Extreme-2.

117
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.809
The premiere's Friday, so l brought you tickets.

118
00:15:58.018 --> 00:16:00.354
l love tickets!

119
00:16:03.814 --> 00:16:05.358
-Hello?
-Yeah?

120
00:16:05.566 --> 00:16:07.527
-Be right in.
-Thanks.

121
00:16:07.693 --> 00:16:09.236
Sorry.

122
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:12.906
-Thanks for helping out, Jason.
-Yeah, yeah.

123
00:16:14.032 --> 00:16:15.033
Charlie.

124
00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:19.620
Bosley!

125
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:22.498
What's happening, Angels?
How y'all doing?

126
00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:23.916
-Hey.
-Hey, Bos.

127
00:16:24.083 --> 00:16:27.585
Look here.
 l see my brother ain't checked the books in a while.

128
00:16:27.753 --> 00:16:28.921
We have a book?

129
00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:33.174
Look here, lovelies, l only been here a few days, but will you explain...

130
00:16:33.341 --> 00:16:34.801
...what the hell is this?

131
00:16:34.967 --> 00:16:36.052
Now, what--?

132
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.556
Careful with that, Bos.

133
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.724
l'm all right.

134
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.418
And l also see y'all being played.

135
00:16:45.444 --> 00:16:47.420
Five G's for a Kevlar vest?

136
00:16:47.562 --> 00:16:48.373
We need those.

137
00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:50.423
They're made especially for us.

138
00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:53.609
What? You all fine, but you crazy.

139
00:16:57.112 --> 00:16:58.196
What?

140
00:16:58.363 --> 00:16:59.948
Bosley, come here.

141
00:17:00.448 --> 00:17:01.950
-Have a seat, Bos.
-Okay.

142
00:17:02.117 --> 00:17:03.368
-Bos.
-What?

143
00:17:03.577 --> 00:17:05.035
B.

144
00:17:06.287 --> 00:17:08.497
Your brother didn't sweat the details.

145
00:17:08.664 --> 00:17:10.958
-We do what it takes.
-Right.

146
00:17:11.125 --> 00:17:13.126
So, what does a Bosley do around here?

147
00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:17.297
-He does the most important job of all.
-What's that?

148
00:17:17.463 --> 00:17:20.300
He connects us with Charlie.

149
00:17:22.134 --> 00:17:25.512
Okay. All right. All right.

150
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.891
Good morning, Angels.

151
00:17:26.918 --> 00:17:28.416
Good morning, Charlie.

152
00:17:28.557 --> 00:17:31.810
Bosley, I hope the Angels aren't being too rough on you.

153
00:17:31.976 --> 00:17:33.991
Man, please. l date fat women.

154
00:17:34.017 --> 00:17:35.963
What are you talking about?

155
00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:39.066
Great work in Mongolia, Angels...

156
00:17:39.232 --> 00:17:42.736
...but I'm afraid the case has tak en a new turn.

157
00:17:42.903 --> 00:17:45.280
Goddamn! What the f--?
Look-- Look--

158
00:17:47.741 --> 00:17:50.247
l know where l'm watching the game at tonight.

159
00:17:50.273 --> 00:17:51.018
Look at that.

160
00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.372
Angels, I'd lik e to introduce Roger wixon, senior director of the FBI.

161
00:17:55.539 --> 00:17:57.165
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Pleasure.

162
00:17:57.333 --> 00:17:58.666
-Hi.
-Hello.

163
00:17:58.834 --> 00:18:00.877
Over the years, the Townsend Agency...

164
00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:03.212
...has work ed on projects for the bureau...

165
00:18:03.379 --> 00:18:07.258
...but never one with so many innocent lives at stak e.

166
00:18:07.424 --> 00:18:11.011
Hey, l'm busy watching that doggone screen.

167
00:18:11.178 --> 00:18:12.804
Good job, Bos.

168
00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.808
Angels, you're aware of the Federal witness Protection Program.

169
00:18:17.975 --> 00:18:20.227
People who testify against major crime figures...

170
00:18:20.394 --> 00:18:22.647
...are relocated and given new identities.

171
00:18:22.816 --> 00:18:26.320
The identities of these witnesses are protected by a program called HALO.:

172
00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:29.569
Hidden Alias List Operation.

173
00:18:29.736 --> 00:18:33.031
The list is encrypted on two titanium rings.

174
00:18:33.197 --> 00:18:36.283
The data on each ring is indecipherable on its own...

175
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.537
...but when they are read together, their codes unlock each other.

176
00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:41.996
Who wears the rings?

177
00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:44.832
The head of the U.S. Marshal Service was wearing one.

178
00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:46.918
-Ray Carter.
-Good morning.

179
00:18:47.085 --> 00:18:48.460
Hey, how are you feeling?

180
00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:50.905
Couple of fractured ribs, but I'll live.

181
00:18:51.047 --> 00:18:52.381
Who wears the other ring?

182
00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:56.176
The head of security for the Justice Department, william Rose Bailey.

183
00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:58.719
Unfortunately, he was killed this morning.

184
00:18:58.887 --> 00:19:00.658
Now both rings are in the open.

185
00:19:00.684 --> 00:19:01.998
So the list is out.

186
00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.225
Someone's contacted the major crime families offering to sell the list.

187
00:19:04.392 --> 00:19:04.975
Antonioni Crime Family

188
00:19:05.142 --> 00:19:06.226

One of our protected witness, Alan Caufield...

192
00:19:10.063 --> 00:19:11.898
... was found dead at home in the Valley.

193
00:19:12.065 --> 00:19:17.362
Angels, we need to get the HALO rings back before the list is sold.

194
00:19:17.529 --> 00:19:19.243
We'll start at the Caufield house.

195
00:19:19.269 --> 00:19:20.932
See if that leads us to HALO.

196
00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:25.410
Hey, Charlie, we could really use Bosley's help on this one.

197
00:19:25.577 --> 00:19:28.079
-Get to drive the racecar?
-Not today.

198
00:19:28.247 --> 00:19:30.206
-Blow up a castle?
-Not yet, Bos.

199
00:19:30.373 --> 00:19:32.458
Well, what do y'all need me to do?

200
00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:37.087
-Read some body language.
-Hell, yeah.

205
00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:07.698
l'm not going nowhere near no dead body.

206
00:20:11.993 --> 00:20:15.788
Freeze, ladies.
 lf you're not a dead body, other side of the ropes.

207
00:20:15.997 --> 00:20:17.590
We got a serious situation here.

208
00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:19.108
My men have the area secure.

209
00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:21.502
l have to ask you to evacuate immediately.

210
00:20:21.668 --> 00:20:27.424
We got a two 11, a one 83, believe it or not,
we got an eleven -350, and it ain't pretty.

211
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:31.719
An eleven -350?
You found an illegal chinchilla ranch on the premises?

212
00:20:31.928 --> 00:20:34.388
lt's a chinchilla farm.

213
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.307
But you're good.

214
00:20:36.473 --> 00:20:38.683
Negatory to orders to relinquish locality.

215
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:40.810
Circumspect to your observation...

216
00:20:41.019 --> 00:20:45.022
...we'll proceed to the interior of the dwelling with your accompaniment.

217
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:48.015
Well, l do not copy. Repeat, do not copy.

218
00:20:48.041 --> 00:20:50.177
l'll have to ask my sergeant.

219
00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:52.696
Your sergeant is here.

220
00:21:11.213 --> 00:21:12.798
Hands off.

221
00:21:12.963 --> 00:21:17.218
lf you had your game faces on at the academy, you ought to figure this out.

222
00:21:17.384 --> 00:21:19.011
Simple café coronary.
Freak show choked to death.

223
00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:19.957
Simple café coronary.

224
00:21:19.983 --> 00:21:21.288
Freak show choked to death.

225
00:21:21.429 --> 00:21:23.014
Questions?

226
00:21:23.723 --> 00:21:27.392
Examination of soft palate reveals porcine byproduct...

227
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.229
...lodged in vestibule.

228
00:21:30.062 --> 00:21:31.682
Okay, let's do this.

229
00:21:31.709 --> 00:21:32.923
Come on, baby.

230
00:21:33.065 --> 00:21:36.109
Caufield shows no signs of trauma to the larynx.

231
00:21:36.276 --> 00:21:38.904
His struggle pattern indicates that he didn't choke.

232
00:21:41.114 --> 00:21:42.407
He was smothered.

233
00:21:42.573 --> 00:21:45.075
Ladies, we got some carnauba residue.

234
00:21:45.243 --> 00:21:47.035
Pineapple.

235
00:21:47.203 --> 00:21:50.330
Oh, it's Sex Wax. Best for your stick.

236
00:21:50.498 --> 00:21:51.748
Pardon me?

237
00:21:51.915 --> 00:21:53.007
The killer's a surfer.

238
00:21:53.033 --> 00:21:54.026
How do you know?

239
00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:57.295
He used the credit card he uses to scrape wax off his board...

240
00:21:58.254 --> 00:22:00.047
...to gain entry into the house.

241
00:22:00.214 --> 00:22:02.508
Thrasher scumbag surfers.

242
00:22:02.925 --> 00:22:04.593
Freeze!

243
00:22:05.426 --> 00:22:07.141
l found a foreign print.

244
00:22:07.167 --> 00:22:10.165
He was wearing reissued 1989 Air Jordans.

245

A limited promotional version sold...

246
00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:15.602
...only at the Foot Locker in Fontana, in the summer of 2002.

247
00:22:16.562 --> 00:22:18.939
There's a discrepancy in weight distribution...

248
00:22:19.106 --> 00:22:21.941
...between the left and right sides.

249
00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:26.780
An anterior cruciate ligament that was repaired in the last year.

250
00:22:27.989 --> 00:22:29.282
All right, who did it?

251
00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:31.617
A killer with a scar on his knee who surfs.

252
00:22:31.784 --> 00:22:32.826
Did he stink?

253
00:22:32.994 --> 00:22:34.455
There's a hurricane off Baja.

254
00:22:34.482 --> 00:22:36.647
That means good swells for south beaches.

255
00:22:36.788 --> 00:22:38.081
Was there a lot of blood?

256
00:22:38.248 --> 00:22:40.012
Offshore winds, Third Point.

257
00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:41.234
Malibu's pumping.

258
00:22:41.375 --> 00:22:43.565
Alex, surfboards are at your house.

259
00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:45.405
Share it with me, Angels.

260
00:22:46.423 --> 00:22:47.631
Freeze!

261
00:22:51.218 --> 00:22:51.885
Daddy? Daddy!

262
00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:53.845
Daddy? Daddy!

263
00:22:54.012 --> 00:22:58.141
Darling!
 l was meeting your mother in Bali, and they cancelled the flight.

264
00:22:58.308 --> 00:22:59.943
Some sort of monsoon.

265
00:22:59.969 --> 00:23:03.004
So how is my favourite little ferret?

266
00:23:03.645 --> 00:23:05.480
Do the face.

267
00:23:06.815 --> 00:23:09.233
No, come on. Do it properly.

268
00:23:14.154 --> 00:23:15.212
That is so cute.

269
00:23:15.238 --> 00:23:17.350
l do the whiskers with my dad.

270
00:23:18.743 --> 00:23:22.329
Mr. Munday, it is such a pleasure to finally meet you.

271
00:23:22.495 --> 00:23:23.997
l'm Dylan.

272
00:23:24.164 --> 00:23:25.332
That's Natalie.

273
00:23:25.497 --> 00:23:27.958
l assure you, none of the stories are true.

274
00:23:28.126 --> 00:23:30.502
Well, some of them are.

275
00:23:31.962 --> 00:23:34.255
So you work with Alex at the hospital?

276
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:41.220
Yes! Natalie works in the psychiatric ward...

277
00:23:41.387 --> 00:23:44.473
...and Dylan is the head of gynaecology.

278
00:23:45.515 --> 00:23:46.808
Really?

279
00:23:46.975 --> 00:23:48.769
-So young.
-l know.

280
00:23:48.936 --> 00:23:50.915
We were just on our way out.

281
00:23:50.941 --> 00:23:54.049
We have a major procedure coming up, so....

282
00:23:54.774 --> 00:23:56.448
Duty calls. Sorry.

283
00:23:56.474 --> 00:23:58.426
l've got to prep.

284
00:23:58.569 --> 00:23:59.612
Scrub up.

285
00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:01.155
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

286
00:24:01.321 --> 00:24:02.572
See you in a minute.

287
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.064
lt's just a tiny emergency.

288
00:24:04.091 --> 00:24:05.267
Make yourself at home.

289
00:24:05.408 --> 00:24:07.369
We'll talk later.
Go save lives.

290
00:24:08.203 --> 00:24:09.371

299
00:24:42.192 --> 00:24:43.651
Just blend in.

300
00:24:43.677 --> 00:24:45.136
Be cool, Bos.

301
00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:55.035
Got any wax?

302
00:24:55.203 --> 00:24:56.662
Great job, Bos.

Suspect four eliminated.

00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:07.380
Suspect four eliminated.

309
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.134

-Madison Lee?

311
00:25:18.931 --> 00:25:20.183
Oh, my God.

-Of course.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.983
Wow. l've heard so many stories about you.

315
00:25:30.009 --> 00:25:31.677
You're my favourite Angel.

316
00:25:31.819 --> 00:25:35.196
She won the Nobel Prize for her research on flying mammals.

317
00:25:35.363 --> 00:25:37.574
And predicted Carmine DeSoto's every move...

318
00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:40.034
...by using the Cosmo Bedside Astrologer.

319
00:25:42.829 --> 00:25:46.999
l also set the clock on Charlie's VCR.

320
00:25:47.832 --> 00:25:50.127
And she invented the molar mike.

321
00:25:50.293 --> 00:25:53.004
-Dylan and Alex?
-Yeah.

322
00:25:54.881 --> 00:25:56.774

324
00:25:59.802 --> 00:26:02.220
Bring it on Bitch!

325
00:26:04.306 --> 00:26:06.266
Only one waxer left.

326
00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:07.559
Wait a second.

327
00:26:08.143 --> 00:26:10.603

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.914
Check it out.
Brown shorts, red board, 11 o'clock.

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:18.943
-Yummy.
-That's what l thought.

331
00:26:19.111 --> 00:26:20.585
Case closed. Nat, move in.

332
00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:21.971
Dylan thinks he's hot.

333
00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:23.197
What do you mean?

334
00:26:23.364 --> 00:26:25.991
You always fall for the bad guy.

335
00:26:26.658 --> 00:26:29.536
Then this guy must be really evil.

336
00:26:29.703 --> 00:26:31.460
You should see the new agency.

337
00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:32.482
lt's beautiful.

338
00:26:32.623 --> 00:26:36.459
Maybe l will.
 Tell Charlie hello for me when you see him.

339
00:26:38.377 --> 00:26:39.712
You know.

340
00:27:05.443 --> 00:27:07.569
There she goes.

341
00:27:08.487 --> 00:27:11.115
Who do you think will be the first of us to leave?

342
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:13.158
You, me or Natalie?

343
00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:14.535
-What are you talking about?
-l think it'll be Nat.

344
00:27:14.535 --> 00:27:15.423
What are you talking about?

345
00:27:15.449 --> 00:27:16.271
l think it'll be Nat.

346
00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:18.079
Why? Did she say something?

347
00:27:18.247 --> 00:27:19.824
Nat and Pete live together now.

348
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.274
Soon they'll be engaged...

349
00:27:21.415 --> 00:27:23.584
...and you and l will wear pink dresses...

350
00:27:23.751 --> 00:27:27.087
...at the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Pete Kominsky.

351
00:27:28.214 --> 00:27:32.217
Yeah, but even if she got married, she'd never leave us.

352
00:27:32.383 --> 00:27:36.388
Sooner or later, you and l are gonna have to break in a new Angel.

353
00:27:38.764 --> 00:27:40.391
Good morning, Angels.

354
00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:43.017
Good morning, Charlie.

355
00:27:44.353 --> 00:27:45.896
-Good morning, Angels.

Good morning, Charlie.

Good morning, Charlie.

361
00:28:03.787 --> 00:28:07.915
l mean, you didn't think it would be the three of us forever, did you?

362
00:28:08.249 --> 00:28:09.707
l think l lost my nuts.

363
00:28:09.734 --> 00:28:11.444
Your nuts ever get small?

364
00:28:11.585 --> 00:28:14.114
When l get in water, they just shrink up.

365
00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.990
They become like one marble.

366
00:28:29.809 --> 00:28:31.186
Killer, huh?

367
00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.147
l just got so excited.

368
00:28:33.354 --> 00:28:36.190
When it's big like that, l love to ride it hard and rough.

369
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.902
Sorry.

370
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.280
The way l was getting pounded, l'm gonna be wet for hours.

371
00:28:56.918 --> 00:28:58.877
Catch you later.

372
00:29:00.837 --> 00:29:02.881
Randy Emmers.

-l'll look for Emmers.
-Yeah.

383

All right, Leo, you're mine.

384
00:29:54.885 --> 00:29:55.678
Good luck.

385
00:29:55.678 --> 00:29:56.845
Good luck.

-Rules are, there are no rules.

391
00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:10.273
Three out of four don't cross the finish line.

392
00:30:10.607 --> 00:30:12.943
l'll take those odds.

393
00:30:17.071 --> 00:30:18.990
Hey, how's it going?

394
00:30:19.156 --> 00:30:20.727
Metzger's at the far double.

395
00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:22.435

396
00:30:22.575 --> 00:30:24.745

You and Pete moving in together is a big deal.

00:30:50.642 --> 00:30:52.296
Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

420
00:30:52.322 --> 00:30:54.464
So where do you see this going?

421
00:30:54.604 --> 00:30:57.149
Going? l'm confused.

422
00:30:57.315 --> 00:31:00.234
Okay, say someone was to come up to me and say:

423
00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:03.904
' Hey, Dylan, do you think Natalie wants to get married?'

424
00:31:04.238 --> 00:31:09.409
What? Did Pete ask you to ask me if l wanted to get married?

425
00:31:09.577 --> 00:31:11.828
-No.
-Because we just moved in together.

426
00:31:11.996 --> 00:31:14.122
Heads up, l've spotted Emmers.
l'm on him.

427
00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:16.499
Red bike, red helmet.

428
00:31:38.352 --> 00:31:40.520
Nat, number 25. Check it out.

429
00:31:41.146 --> 00:31:43.230
The lion. That's Leo.

430
00:31:44.566 --> 00:31:46.358

431
00:31:59.161 --> 00:32:00.955
l got shut out.

432
00:32:07.294 --> 00:32:09.546
-What was that?
-He's after Leo.

433
00:32:19.387 --> 00:32:21.557
He just took out a guy in the front double.

434
00:32:26.228 --> 00:32:27.936
He's making his way up to Leo.

435
00:32:27.963 --> 00:32:29.214

436
00:32:39.781 --> 00:32:41.574

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.770
What the hell are you doing?!

441
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.440
Nat, he's on your 6.

454
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.324

What the hell's this?

459
00:36:17.725 --> 00:36:20.728
Hey, this is a picture of Dylan.

460
00:36:20.936 --> 00:36:23.855
The name on the back is Helen Zaas.

461
00:36:28.734 --> 00:36:30.819
Helen Zaas.

462
00:36:32.155 --> 00:36:33.822
My name before l went into...

463
00:36:33.989 --> 00:36:36.491
...the Witness Protection Program 8 years ago.

464
00:36:36.699 --> 00:36:38.784
And then l became Dylan Sanders.

465
00:36:38.993 --> 00:36:41.495
when the FBI realized the young lady's potential...

466
00:36:42.038 --> 00:36:43.331
... they gave me a call.

467
00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:46.375
-Okay, wait. Helen Zaas?
-Yeah.

468
00:36:46.542 --> 00:36:47.917
-That's your name?
-Yeah.

469
00:36:48.085 --> 00:36:49.878
Helen Zaas.

470
00:36:51.296 --> 00:36:54.580
So where does that name come from originally?

471
00:36:54.607 --> 00:36:56.034
ls that Ass-tralian?

472
00:36:56.968 --> 00:36:58.845
Yeah.

473
00:36:59.053 --> 00:37:02.056
Oh, my God, you must have been the butt of every joke.

474
00:37:02.221 --> 00:37:04.287
Did you drive an Aston Martin?

475
00:37:04.313 --> 00:37:06.377
Alex, we're being asinine.

476
00:37:06.517 --> 00:37:08.061
Yes, you are.

477
00:37:08.227 --> 00:37:09.248
Don't worry, Dylan.

478
00:37:09.274 --> 00:37:11.422
We're still gonna be your best butties.

479
00:37:12.231 --> 00:37:17.027
Now, Angels, a rose by any other name still smells as sweet.

480
00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:18.260
Thank you, Charlie.

481
00:37:18.287 --> 00:37:19.472
lt's not that funny.

482
00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:20.739
Yeah, it is.

483
00:37:20.946 --> 00:37:22.844
Bos, can l get a ruling on this one?

484
00:37:22.871 --> 00:37:23.767
You sure can.

485
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:24.920
You know what?

486
00:37:24.947 --> 00:37:28.271
Personally, l'm not interested in Helen Zaas.

487
00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:30.164
l'm more concerned about yours.

488
00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:33.416
No matter what, you're still gonna be our Dylan.

489
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:34.486
Thank you, Bos.

490
00:37:34.512 --> 00:37:35.443
You're welcome.

491
00:37:35.585 --> 00:37:38.962
Let me guess, you fell for the bad guy.

492
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.674
l fell for the worst guy.

493
00:37:41.841 --> 00:37:44.093
But he was so cute, and l liked him so much.

494
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.844
We had so much fun together...

495
00:37:46.011 --> 00:37:48.889
...just driving around, listening to metal and....

496
00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.725
8 years ago

497
00:38:01.775 --> 00:38:03.944
And then one night, things got really bad.

498
00:38:09.156 --> 00:38:10.577
l love you!

499
00:38:10.603 --> 00:38:14.479
l would die for you, Seamus!

500
00:38:15.204 --> 00:38:17.039
O'Grady.

501
00:38:18.332 --> 00:38:20.084
You got some balls.

502
00:38:28.298 --> 00:38:32.427
He said he'd kill me if l told anyone, but l had to put him away.

503
00:38:32.594 --> 00:38:33.818
Of course you did.

504
00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:35.747
You did the right thing.

505
00:38:36.722 --> 00:38:38.933
-He was my first.
-Really?

506
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.609
But you told me you never did it.

507
00:38:41.635 --> 00:38:43.003
My first bust.

508
00:38:43.146 --> 00:38:45.647
-Yeah.
-Who was this guy?

509
00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:51.361
-Seamus O'Grady.
-O'Grady?

510
00:38:51.527 --> 00:38:52.973
As in the lrish mob?

511
00:38:52.999 --> 00:38:54.805
l sent him to prison.

512
00:38:57.866 --> 00:39:00.410
Right now

513
00:39:07.542 --> 00:39:09.419
O'Grady.

514
00:39:11.254 --> 00:39:12.504
You're out.

515
00:39:19.303 --> 00:39:21.721
O'Grady, what about your belongings?

516
00:39:35.025 --> 00:39:37.860
So if l have these, she'll find me?

517
00:39:41.989 --> 00:39:44.950
-The O'Gradys killed my parents.
-What?

518
00:39:45.659 --> 00:39:47.160
Sorry, Max.

519
00:39:47.744 --> 00:39:49.787
l testified against them.

520
00:39:50.038 --> 00:39:52.327
Wait a second.
Alan Caufield.

521
00:39:52.353 --> 00:39:55.193
He testified against the O'Gradys.

522
00:39:55.334 --> 00:39:57.354
That's it.
 The O'Gradys must have HALO.

523
00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.571
This is our one lead.

524
00:39:58.712 --> 00:40:00.797
The Thin Man.

525
00:40:00.963 --> 00:40:03.717
-Our favourite assassin.
-That's right.

526
00:40:03.883 --> 00:40:05.391
This needs to go get analysed.

527
00:40:05.418 --> 00:40:07.579
Yes, let's get up in there and do that.

528
00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.347
Let me see it.

529
00:40:10.806 --> 00:40:14.601
Yeah, l know exactly what this is.
l have one.

530
00:40:14.935 --> 00:40:16.645
The nuns gave it to us at the orphanage.

531
00:40:16.811 --> 00:40:18.646
Orphanage.

532
00:40:18.813 --> 00:40:22.566
-Good work.
-Max is in our protective custody now.

533
00:40:22.733 --> 00:40:24.908
It's up to us to k eep him safe.

534
00:40:24.935 --> 00:40:27.721
Hey, l know the safest place in town.

535
00:40:42.876 --> 00:40:45.003
Listen, don't you worry about a thing.

536
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.405
No O'Grady ever set foot in South Central.

537
00:40:47.431 --> 00:40:48.281
Can you dig it?

538
00:40:48.423 --> 00:40:49.925
-Yeah.
-This is my mama house.

539
00:40:50.132 --> 00:40:52.885
Rule number one: Don't look her in the eye. Understand?

540
00:40:53.094 --> 00:40:54.762
Or she'll pop. Can you dig it?

541
00:40:55.346 --> 00:40:56.931
-Bosley.
-Yes, ma'am?

542
00:40:57.138 --> 00:40:58.682
You get over here.

543
00:40:58.848 --> 00:41:00.016
Hey, Mama.

544
00:41:00.225 --> 00:41:01.831
What kind of trouble you in now?

545
00:41:01.857 --> 00:41:03.712
l'm not in any trou-- Yes, ma'am.

546
00:41:03.895 --> 00:41:05.104
-Come on.
-Yes, ma'am.

547
00:41:19.492 --> 00:41:21.536
-Look at those knockers.
-Boys!

548
00:41:29.334 --> 00:41:32.003
Mother superior will see you now.

549
00:41:36.424 --> 00:41:38.551
Mother, do you recognize this man?

550
00:41:38.759 --> 00:41:40.802
Of course l know who he is.

551
00:41:41.011 --> 00:41:44.264
We called him Anthony, after St. Anthony of Padua...

552
00:41:44.431 --> 00:41:48.435
...healer of the mute. Please come forward.

553
00:41:49.685 --> 00:41:51.730
Please, girls.

554
00:41:57.943 --> 00:42:01.988
But his real name, like so much about him, was a mystery.

555
00:42:05.033 --> 00:42:08.327
He came to us when he was 7.

556
00:42:08.869 --> 00:42:13.290
He was found wandering in the hills, living off roots and insects.

557
00:42:13.665 --> 00:42:16.709
w e believe his family was in a Romanian circus troupe...

558
00:42:17.169 --> 00:42:19.837
... who died in a terrible fire.

559
00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:23.049
Although the doctors could find nothing physically wrong...

560
00:42:23.215 --> 00:42:25.175
...he never spok e a word.

561
00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:27.540
And there were other idiosyncrasies.

562
00:42:27.567 --> 00:42:29.580
He was a painfully shy child...

563
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:29.971
... until it came time for his monthly haircut.

564
00:42:29.971 --> 00:42:34.058
... until it came time for his monthly haircut.

565
00:42:43.233 --> 00:42:46.694
Then one morning, he was simply gone.

566
00:42:47.236 --> 00:42:49.697
The Thin Man was protecting Max.

567
00:42:51.115 --> 00:42:54.743
So you're saying this man is the sole benefactor of your orphanage?

568
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:58.497
Yes, he really is an angel.

569
00:42:59.915 --> 00:43:03.377
Mother, have you had contact with him since?

570
00:43:03.542 --> 00:43:05.503
Well, not really that much...

571
00:43:05.669 --> 00:43:08.089
...except for the odd haircut now and then.

572
00:43:13.427 --> 00:43:15.478
But he does send gifts.

573
00:43:15.504 --> 00:43:17.288
Like this morning.

574
00:43:18.348 --> 00:43:20.849
-Emmers' car.
-That is a nice ride.

575
00:43:21.016 --> 00:43:25.771
An original 1967 numbers-matching GTO.

576
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.111
-Thorn Birds.
-l know.

577
00:43:35.737 --> 00:43:37.239
Bird poo.

578
00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:40.909
What order did you girls say you were from again?

579
00:43:41.076 --> 00:43:43.745
-Larus californicus.
-California gull.

580
00:43:43.912 --> 00:43:46.206
Fecal matter consists mostly of scaly clypeiform.

581
00:43:46.372 --> 00:43:49.126
Sardines that fed on large brown algae, l'd say.

582
00:43:49.291 --> 00:43:52.753
There's also traces of tanker fuel and storm-water runoff as well.

583
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.880
Sea gulls, tankers, storm water.

584
00:43:56.048 --> 00:43:58.466
San Pedro Harbour.

585
00:44:15.232 --> 00:44:18.151
-Who are you?
-What?! Wait.

586
00:44:19.651 --> 00:44:20.944
-What?
-Who are you?

587
00:44:21.112 --> 00:44:23.613
Oh, Jason Gibbons.

588
00:44:24.448 --> 00:44:26.241
The actor.

589
00:44:26.992 --> 00:44:29.577
Maybe you've seen Maximum Extreme.

590
00:44:29.744 --> 00:44:31.245
No.

591
00:44:31.413 --> 00:44:32.606
lt was such a big movie.

592
00:44:32.632 --> 00:44:34.024
What are you doing here?

593
00:44:34.165 --> 00:44:35.770
l'm Alex's boyfriend.

594
00:44:35.797 --> 00:44:37.401
Alex's boyfriend.

595
00:44:37.543 --> 00:44:40.629
Yeah. Well, technically, we're on what she calls a time-out.

596
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:43.067
What does that mean?

597
00:44:43.094 --> 00:44:44.699
Exactly.
 Thank you.

598
00:44:44.841 --> 00:44:49.762
Yeah.
 l gotta say, you must be the world's most understanding father.

599
00:44:50.179 --> 00:44:52.848
-Why?
-All the wild stuff she does.

600
00:44:53.015 --> 00:44:56.517
When l first met Alex, l thought she was a bikini waxer.

601
00:44:57.728 --> 00:44:59.937
lt was months before l knew about Charlie.

602
00:45:01.314 --> 00:45:02.690
Who's Charlie?

603
00:45:02.856 --> 00:45:06.359
San Pedro Harbour

604
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.124
Merkin.

605
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.293
That was the name of Seamus' pit bull.

606
00:45:27.712 --> 00:45:28.960
Armed guards.

607
00:45:28.987 --> 00:45:31.866
Security looks pretty tight.

608
00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.594
This dock is like a fortress.

609
00:45:34.801 --> 00:45:37.888
lD badges.
l think cargo's our best bet.

610
00:45:38.095 --> 00:45:40.849
-Townsend Agency.
-Bos, recon incoming.

611
00:45:41.015 --> 00:45:43.977
-Got you, baby.
-Yeah, check the photo.

612
00:45:49.898 --> 00:45:52.276
That's our man.

613
00:45:53.777 --> 00:45:55.737
The Treasure Chest.

614
00:45:56.655 --> 00:45:57.991
Do a little dance.

615
00:45:58.017 --> 00:45:59.723
Make a little love.

616
00:46:00.617 --> 00:46:02.701
Get down tonight.

617
00:46:37.857 --> 00:46:39.609
-There he is, first table on the right.
-Yeah, baby!

618
00:46:39.609 --> 00:46:41.313
There he is, first table on the right.

619
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.012
Yeah, baby!

620
00:48:45.763 --> 00:48:47.515
Hold.

621
00:48:58.941 --> 00:49:00.081
Paddy O'Malley?

622
00:49:00.107 --> 00:49:02.386
Top of the morning to you.

623
00:49:02.528 --> 00:49:07.282
You know, you just don't look much like any Paddy l've ever seen before.

624
00:49:07.824 --> 00:49:09.659
Ain't never heard of no black lrish?

625
00:49:09.868 --> 00:49:11.369
-Black lrish?
-That's right.

626
00:49:11.577 --> 00:49:14.538
Who do you think invented the McRib, Lucky Charms, huh?

627
00:49:14.746 --> 00:49:16.409
Shamrock Shake?
That's ours.

628
00:49:16.435 --> 00:49:17.859
Give me your papers.

629
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:19.835
-What?
-Your papers.

630
00:49:20.419 --> 00:49:21.628
Let me tell you...

631
00:49:21.837 --> 00:49:24.297
...you got nerve to ask me about my papers.

632
00:49:24.506 --> 00:49:26.799
My family suffered, man, for lack of potatoes.

633
00:49:27.007 --> 00:49:28.299
Foot-and-mouth disease.

634
00:49:28.325 --> 00:49:29.952
Canker sores. Circumcision.

635
00:49:30.093 --> 00:49:33.012
-Circumcision?
-Right, my wife just had a set of twins.

636
00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.889
-Both leprechauns.
-Leprechauns?

637
00:49:35.098 --> 00:49:37.851
Get a whiff.
lrish Spring.

638
00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:41.146
You don't believe that, wipe your ass with a four-leaf clover.

639
00:49:41.354 --> 00:49:43.397
McGinty!

640
00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:45.190
Get this stuff on the ship.

641
00:49:58.453 --> 00:50:00.745
-Tough, eh?
-That was heavy.

642
00:50:04.207 --> 00:50:06.751
l say we should take a break.

643
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.641
Wait a second.

644
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:27.227
l smell a rat.

645
00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:06.054
This ring is pure platinum.

646
00:51:06.221 --> 00:51:07.889
The HALO rings are titanium.

647
00:51:08.389 --> 00:51:10.475
HALO data chips should be weightless...

648
00:51:10.641 --> 00:51:14.436
...surrounded by a hollow core that prevents thermal induction.

649
00:51:14.603 --> 00:51:16.939
lf the density of the object...

650
00:51:17.105 --> 00:51:22.401
...is less than that of the substance in which it is immersed....

651
00:51:26.072 --> 00:51:27.573
lt floats.

652
00:51:29.908 --> 00:51:32.118
There they are.

653
00:51:37.331 --> 00:51:41.126
l'm sure Helen Zaas was great, but l just can't imagine life...

654
00:51:41.293 --> 00:51:44.088
...without Dylan Sanders.

655
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.760
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-Cheers to that.

656
00:51:52.136 --> 00:51:52.887
What's the rush, Helen?

657
00:51:52.887 --> 00:51:54.429
What's the rush, Helen?

658
00:51:59.226 --> 00:52:01.561
You've only been here five minutes.

659
00:52:03.146 --> 00:52:06.107
Now, l've waited for you before.

660
00:52:09.026 --> 00:52:13.573
Matter of fact, l've waited for you 2920 days.

661
00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:17.617
That's 417 weeks.

662
00:52:19.327 --> 00:52:21.871
That's 96 months.

663
00:52:23.414 --> 00:52:25.541
That's eight years.

664
00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:27.792
Enough about me.

665
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.052
What about you, Helen?

666
00:52:29.078 --> 00:52:30.070
How have you been?

667
00:52:30.212 --> 00:52:32.130
Seamus.

668
00:52:32.297 --> 00:52:35.466
l see you still got a nice arse on you.

669
00:52:36.259 --> 00:52:38.511
You got a lot of nerve stealing from me.

670
00:52:38.677 --> 00:52:40.645
Stealing back's more like it.

671
00:52:40.672 --> 00:52:42.165
Give us the rings.

672
00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:48.312
Give us the rings.

673
00:53:01.448 --> 00:53:03.325
Give us the rings!

674
00:53:13.916 --> 00:53:15.106
Don't lose those.

675
00:53:15.133 --> 00:53:17.863
We'll be taking them back in about...

676
00:53:19.548 --> 00:53:21.716
...48 seconds.

677
00:53:24.719 --> 00:53:28.180
l've been dreaming one day l'd get to see you again...

678
00:53:29.389 --> 00:53:30.765
...and watch you die.

679
00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:33.100
Keep dreaming.

680
00:53:37.772 --> 00:53:40.524
Lights. Somebody get the lights!

681
00:53:41.233 --> 00:53:43.194
Seamus.

682
00:53:43.985 --> 00:53:45.612
Seamus!

683
00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:48.031
Seamus!

684
00:53:49.407 --> 00:53:51.116
You know l always like it with the light on.

685
00:54:47.792 --> 00:54:49.287
You don't know me anymore.

686
00:54:49.313 --> 00:54:51.612
l'm the only one here who knows you.

687
00:55:07.143 --> 00:55:08.728
Wait, wait, wait!

688
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:42.257
l've got to say, Helen, l've never wanted you more.

689
00:55:42.424 --> 00:55:44.550
-Always wanting what you can't have.
-Yeah?

690
00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.392
l'll have you any way l want.

691
00:56:07.321 --> 00:56:08.489
l got the rings.

692
00:56:08.515 --> 00:56:10.265
Let's get out of here!

693
00:56:57.866 --> 00:56:59.743
Don't let them get away!

694
00:57:03.788 --> 00:57:04.997
Got it?

695
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:22.596
Come on, now!

696
00:57:34.649 --> 00:57:36.316
Let's go.

697
00:57:44.365 --> 00:57:46.325
Dylan, let's go.

698
00:58:16.811 --> 00:58:19.897
You can't hurt me anymore, Helen.

699
00:58:20.355 --> 00:58:23.065
l'm gonna teach you and your friends about pain.

700
00:58:25.569 --> 00:58:29.572
l'm gonna kill them just so you can hear them scream.

701
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.077
Dylan!

702
00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:39.080
l got the rings.

703
00:58:39.915 --> 00:58:41.185
Are you okay?

704
00:58:41.212 --> 00:58:43.068
Yeah, l'm okay.

705
00:58:43.209 --> 00:58:44.585
Hit it.

706
00:59:00.767 --> 00:59:03.060
l know who did it.

707
00:59:04.686 --> 00:59:08.774
Hot damn it, l know who did it.

708
00:59:09.608 --> 00:59:11.109
Col. Mustard, in the dining room, with a lead pipe.

709
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:13.152
Col. Mustard, in the dining room, with a lead pipe.

710
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.862
-Col. Mustard?
-Give me that.

711
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:17.489
-Col. Mustard?
-l said, Col. Mustard...

712
00:59:17.657 --> 00:59:20.158
...in the dining room, with a lead pipe.

713
00:59:20.326 --> 00:59:21.902
Go ahead and look in there.

714
00:59:21.928 --> 00:59:23.270
Why don't you look.

715
00:59:23.411 --> 00:59:25.455
Col. Must--

716
00:59:25.622 --> 00:59:26.998
-Col. Mustard?
-Right.

717
00:59:27.165 --> 00:59:30.043
Col. Mustard? Col. Mustard?

718
00:59:30.877 --> 00:59:32.963
lt's Professor Plum...

719
00:59:33.545 --> 00:59:36.006
...in the conservatory, with a candlestick.

720
00:59:36.173 --> 00:59:38.467
That's right. You got it right.

721
00:59:38.633 --> 00:59:40.885
-Damn!
-How the hell you know that?

722
00:59:41.053 --> 00:59:45.306
We took in one just like him a long time ago, remember?

723
00:59:45.472 --> 00:59:47.391
Yeah, Mama, l remember.

724
00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.419
You gave my room away.

725
00:59:53.647 --> 00:59:55.066
You were the cock?

726
00:59:55.093 --> 00:59:56.591
l was the beaver.

727
00:59:56.733 --> 00:59:59.360
What are the chances that we were both mascots?

728
00:59:59.527 --> 01:00:01.779
-Unbelievable.
-Oh, God.

729
01:00:01.946 --> 01:00:06.117
lt's like we were made for each other.

730
01:00:06.282 --> 01:00:10.995
The best l can figure it is, the clients contact Charlie directly.

731
01:00:11.162 --> 01:00:13.330
Okay, then he phones the girls.

732
01:00:13.498 --> 01:00:17.334
They show up at the place and do their thing.

733
01:00:17.501 --> 01:00:18.476
Now, l know, l know.

734
01:00:18.502 --> 01:00:20.696
At first, l didn't think l could handle it.

735
01:00:20.838 --> 01:00:26.884
The late nights, the never knowing when she'd have to go out on a job.

736
01:00:27.218 --> 01:00:29.594
Some of the men are pretty dangerous.

737
01:00:29.762 --> 01:00:32.597
And the outfits. Oh, boy.

738
01:00:37.853 --> 01:00:39.488
l'll be right back, Pete.

739
01:00:39.514 --> 01:00:41.672
lt's just number one. Have fun.

781
01:01:15.678 --> 01:01:16.837
l'm gonna say this.

782
01:01:16.864 --> 01:01:19.915
Our boy Pete has no idea what he's getting into.

783
01:01:21.058 --> 01:01:24.061
l don't think he really understands the responsibility.

784
01:01:24.227 --> 01:01:26.729
-No, no.
-Pete?

785
01:01:26.896 --> 01:01:29.648
-The commitment.
-Once they get into your house...

786
01:01:29.815 --> 01:01:31.692
-...you lose all spontaneity.
-Gone.

787
01:01:31.858 --> 01:01:33.359
They do whatever they want.

788
01:01:33.527 --> 01:01:34.807
Pete's asking her tonight?

789
01:01:34.833 --> 01:01:36.013
That's what he said.

790
01:01:40.366 --> 01:01:42.786
But Alex is a wildcat.

791
01:01:42.993 --> 01:01:46.914
l mean, she gives as good as she gets.

792
01:01:47.915 --> 01:01:49.291
Alex! Hey.

793
01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:52.628
Jason, Daddy.
What are you doing here, Jason?

794
01:01:52.835 --> 01:01:56.506
l was just explaining to your father here all about Charlie.

795
01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.591
Charlie?

796
01:02:00.593 --> 01:02:03.428
-Daddy....
-lt's all right, darling. l know.

797
01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:05.931
l'm so sorry, Daddy, that l didn't tell you.

798
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.836
l didn't think you'd approve.

799
01:02:07.862 --> 01:02:10.377
l know you wanted me to be a neurosurgeon.

800
01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:15.105
But l've discovered a whole new way to help people...

801
01:02:15.564 --> 01:02:18.316
...that makes me feel so...

802
01:02:19.984 --> 01:02:21.945
...alive.

803
01:02:23.655 --> 01:02:25.364
Whatever makes you happy.

804
01:02:28.492 --> 01:02:30.327
l am so relieved!

805
01:02:30.994 --> 01:02:34.497
lt's just been killing me, you not knowing all these years. l--

806
01:02:34.831 --> 01:02:36.166
Daddy...

807
01:02:36.332 --> 01:02:39.293
...Natalie, Dylan and l are a team.

808
01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.505
And we just took on 12 sailors.

809
01:02:46.091 --> 01:02:50.011
You can't even imagine the positions we get ourselves into.

810
01:02:50.387 --> 01:02:52.917
Daddy, l wish you could watch us work.

811
01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:54.207
You'd be so proud.

812
01:02:54.932 --> 01:02:56.684
l'm gonna take a shower...

813
01:02:56.851 --> 01:02:58.489
...because l am covered in--

814
01:02:58.515 --> 01:03:00.504
Well, you can only imagine what.

815
01:03:00.646 --> 01:03:03.816
And then when l get back, l am gonna give you...

816
01:03:03.982 --> 01:03:06.651
...a full blow-by-blow.

817
01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:12.323
Ferret.

818
01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:31.464
-Natalie?
-What, Pete?

819
01:03:32.299 --> 01:03:34.801
-l've been thinking.
-Yeah?

820
01:03:34.968 --> 01:03:38.971
-About what?
-Well, look...

821
01:03:39.514 --> 01:03:41.724
...l know we just moved in together.

822
01:03:41.891 --> 01:03:43.808
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

823
01:03:43.976 --> 01:03:48.147
And l know we agreed to take this kind of slow.

824
01:03:48.731 --> 01:03:50.648
-But--
-Yeah?

825
01:03:51.649 --> 01:03:54.443
There's just something l gotta ask.

826
01:03:55.778 --> 01:03:59.197
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah. 'Oh, boy' is right.

827
01:03:59.907 --> 01:04:01.325
So here it goes.

828
01:04:01.491 --> 01:04:03.869
-Twirl me first.
-Okay.

829
01:04:18.757 --> 01:04:20.008
Yeah.

830
01:04:25.263 --> 01:04:27.014
Hey!

831
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.101
About that question, Pete?

832
01:05:10.127 --> 01:05:12.204
Let's talk about it later.

833
01:06:08.812 --> 01:06:10.982
' Here's all your stuff back.'

834
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:12.441
What's up with that?

835
01:06:13.275 --> 01:06:15.068
She's gone.

836
01:06:15.777 --> 01:06:17.820
She's not coming back.

837
01:06:18.238 --> 01:06:19.947
She loved these boots.

838
01:06:20.156 --> 01:06:22.658
She doesn't want us to get hurt.

839
01:06:24.409 --> 01:06:27.121
Wait a minute, you ladies risk your ass every day.

840
01:06:27.287 --> 01:06:28.539
Yeah.

841
01:06:28.705 --> 01:06:31.541
' l'll never forgive myself if anything happens to you.'

842
01:06:31.708 --> 01:06:33.501
Where do we go from here, Charlie?

843
01:06:33.668 --> 01:06:37.004
Natalie, Alex.
You need to k eep your spirits up.

844
01:06:37.171 --> 01:06:39.049
Any leads on the O'Gradys, Charlie?

845
01:06:39.214 --> 01:06:41.341
Any word on how Seamus broke out of prison?

846
01:06:41.508 --> 01:06:43.078
He didn't break out, Natalie.

847
01:06:43.105 --> 01:06:44.078
He was released.

848
01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:47.598
What? Who would have the power to pull something like that off?

849
01:06:48.097 --> 01:06:49.932
Johnnie Cochran.

850
01:06:50.266 --> 01:06:53.269
The Justice Department, the DA's office, the FBl.

851
01:06:53.769 --> 01:06:56.022
U.S. Marshal.

852
01:06:57.856 --> 01:06:59.107
That's Carter.

853
01:07:05.196 --> 01:07:08.032
l never gave rings to a guy before.

854
01:07:08.616 --> 01:07:10.451
The rings are secure, sir.

855
01:07:10.617 --> 01:07:12.912
And we can all breathe a little easier.

856
01:07:13.078 --> 01:07:16.040
-well done, Angels.
-Thanks, Charlie.

857
01:07:16.206 --> 01:07:18.291
HALO is safe, thanks to you.

858
01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:20.168
lt's been a pleasure.

859
01:07:20.459 --> 01:07:23.003
l hope to work with you ladies again.

860
01:07:23.504 --> 01:07:24.797
But not too soon.

861
01:07:25.297 --> 01:07:27.256
Good luck with everything.

862
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:31.302
Your keys.

863
01:07:35.848 --> 01:07:38.141
-What is it?
-My ribs.

864
01:07:42.562 --> 01:07:44.439
These aren't mine.

865
01:07:49.276 --> 01:07:53.239
That was a nice reach for a guy with a couple of fractured ribs.

866
01:07:53.405 --> 01:07:55.491
Good going, Bos.

867
01:07:55.658 --> 01:07:57.784
-We got him.
-We got who?

868
01:07:57.952 --> 01:08:00.188
Of course, he already had one ring.

869
01:08:00.214 --> 01:08:01.938
He just needed the other.

870
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.375
He wanted to fake his own death so he wouldn't be a suspect.

871
01:08:05.541 --> 01:08:07.167
Who you all talking about?

872
01:08:07.335 --> 01:08:09.545
He needed time for his plan, so he set up Seamus.

873
01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.296
Then turned him loose on Dylan.

874
01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:13.465
I think you're onto something, Angels.

875
01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:16.759
Damn! So Carter's the bad guy!

876
01:08:16.927 --> 01:08:21.597
It's just speculation at this point, Bosley. w e need proof.

877
01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:23.557
-Keys, Bosley.
-Let's hit it.

878
01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:25.226
Punk.

879
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:47.327
Road's clear.
You're good to move in.

880
01:08:52.708 --> 01:08:54.459
Almost there.

881
01:08:56.628 --> 01:08:58.380
Oncoming.

882
01:09:09.055 --> 01:09:10.557
Good job, Alex.

883
01:09:15.186 --> 01:09:16.937
-Can we go yet?
-No, you can't, son.

884
01:09:17.105 --> 01:09:18.564
l gotta make sure it's safe.

885
01:09:18.732 --> 01:09:19.760
We're gonna be late.

886
01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:21.842
You're not gonna be late, young ma--

887
01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:23.235
You old grizzly bear!

888
01:09:23.402 --> 01:09:25.486
Son, please work with me, young man.

889
01:09:25.654 --> 01:09:27.825
A few more minutes and you'll be in school.

890
01:09:27.851 --> 01:09:29.265
You'll never see me again.

891
01:09:29.407 --> 01:09:32.743
Man, you do not mess with a black man's do!

892
01:09:37.581 --> 01:09:39.540
l got the phone line.

893
01:09:45.756 --> 01:09:47.590
l'm calling from my car.
Go secure.

894
01:09:50.759 --> 01:09:52.154
My end of the deal's done.

895
01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.788
The Angels are off the case.

896
01:09:54.262 --> 01:09:56.348
I have the rings.

897
01:09:57.515 --> 01:09:58.683
Dylan.

898
01:10:04.606 --> 01:10:06.732
Alex! Alex!

899
01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.525
Call buyer one.

900
01:10:08.734 --> 01:10:09.943
Alex, are you okay?

901
01:10:10.152 --> 01:10:11.519
Nat, the handle's broken.

902
01:10:11.545 --> 01:10:12.638
l can't disengage.

903
01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:15.657
The deal's on.
Eight o'clock, just as we discussed.

904
01:10:15.822 --> 01:10:17.617
-Nat, plan B!
-l'm calling in Bosley.

905
01:10:17.824 --> 01:10:20.411
We'll get you out of there, Alex.
Hang tight.

906
01:10:21.662 --> 01:10:23.622
Follow the stars beyond the galaxy.

907
01:10:25.998 --> 01:10:27.326
Take shore to hope.

908
01:10:27.352 --> 01:10:28.609
Stop on a stair.

909
01:10:28.793 --> 01:10:30.169
A stair?

910
01:10:30.753 --> 01:10:31.963
Find a man with a map.

911
01:10:32.171 --> 01:10:33.630
Bosley, can you hear me?

912
01:10:33.839 --> 01:10:37.176
Bosley, we're going to Bravo configuration immediately.

913
01:10:37.342 --> 01:10:38.969
l'm on it.
l'm on it. Okay?

914
01:10:39.177 --> 01:10:39.936
Now, get back.

915
01:10:39.962 --> 01:10:42.456
We're going to Bravo configuration.
Get back!

916
01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:47.518
Stop!

917
01:10:47.686 --> 01:10:49.270
Stop!

918
01:10:57.568 --> 01:11:00.779
-Come on.
-Okay. Come on, hurry.

919
01:11:01.531 --> 01:11:03.950
Skip. Run.

920
01:11:08.453 --> 01:11:09.705
Get on out of here.

921
01:11:09.871 --> 01:11:12.541
Come on. Get on out of here.

922
01:11:18.963 --> 01:11:22.133
-Great job, Bos.
-Yeah, right.

923
01:11:22.424 --> 01:11:24.017
Carter's working with a partner.

924
01:11:24.044 --> 01:11:25.786
They're selling the list tonight.

925
01:11:25.927 --> 01:11:28.221
We'll take care of them and then find Dylan.

926
01:11:28.387 --> 01:11:31.474
-See you, Bos.
-Yeah, all right, all right.

927
01:11:34.018 --> 01:11:36.186
This is some bullshit.

928
01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:24.187
-Kelly Garrett.
-Hello, Dylan.

929
01:12:24.396 --> 01:12:26.856
Don't you have a case to solve?

930
01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:32.986
Well, l tried to outrun my past, but it caught up with me yesterday.

931
01:12:33.529 --> 01:12:35.530
And l put my friends in danger.

932
01:12:35.697 --> 01:12:38.658
They're in more danger now without you.

933
01:12:39.743 --> 01:12:42.953
Natalie and Alex are gonna replace me with someone great.

934
01:12:43.121 --> 01:12:44.055
A real Angel.

935
01:12:44.081 --> 01:12:47.818
Not someone who's pretending to be something she's not.

936
01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:51.670
Your past is what makes you who you are, Dylan.

937
01:12:51.836 --> 01:12:55.340
Don't forget that Charlie chose you for a reason.

938
01:12:56.508 --> 01:12:58.468
Angels are like diamonds.

939
01:12:58.634 --> 01:12:59.942
They can't be made.

940
01:12:59.969 --> 01:13:01.621
You have to find them.

941
01:13:03.514 --> 01:13:05.681
Each one is unique.

942
01:13:09.394 --> 01:13:13.940
Sometimes we search too hard for answers that are right in front of us.

943
01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:24.961
The buyers are set.

944
01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:27.379
We did it, partner!

945
01:14:57.823 --> 01:15:00.367
You know, l never really got that partner thing.

946
01:15:12.503 --> 01:15:13.837
Hello, Angels.

947
01:15:14.838 --> 01:15:16.089
Madison Lee.

948
01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:18.634
Why?

949
01:15:18.842 --> 01:15:21.053
Why be an Angel when l can play God?

950
01:15:22.429 --> 01:15:26.015
Looks like one of the three amigos has gone adiós.

951
01:15:44.031 --> 01:15:45.324
Welcome back, Dylan.

952
01:15:45.491 --> 01:15:47.952
You're such a typical rebellious Pisces.

953
01:15:48.117 --> 01:15:50.245
Always out to prove how tough you are...

954
01:15:50.412 --> 01:15:53.373
...and you couldn't make it one day on your own, could you?

955
01:15:53.538 --> 01:15:57.543
Someone reminded me that every Angel is unique.

956
01:15:58.044 --> 01:15:59.711
And l knew it was you.

957
01:15:59.879 --> 01:16:02.005
Who else had contacts in Mongolia...

958
01:16:02.172 --> 01:16:05.675
...could hack the HALO fail-safe and hire a surfer as an assassin?

959
01:16:05.842 --> 01:16:09.053
Same astrological phenom who would refer to a motocross rider...

960
01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:11.889
...with a lion on his helmet as ' Leo.'

961
01:16:14.892 --> 01:16:17.687
Very well done.

962
01:16:17.936 --> 01:16:20.480
Very impressive, really.

963
01:16:20.772 --> 01:16:23.900
You've got it all figured out.

964
01:16:24.818 --> 01:16:28.028
And now l'm gonna really enjoy...

965
01:16:28.195 --> 01:16:30.989
...knocking those halos right off your heads.

966
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:33.449
But you're an Angel.

967
01:16:33.617 --> 01:16:36.452
No. You just don't get it.

968
01:16:36.619 --> 01:16:40.415
l don't take orders from a speaker box anymore.

969
01:16:40.748 --> 01:16:42.750
l work for myself.

970
01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:45.627
Well, your boss sucks.

971
01:16:48.087 --> 01:16:50.506
The Angels' ass-kicking pose.

972
01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:52.508
Seeing the three of you like that...

973
01:16:52.676 --> 01:16:57.305
...does give me this little twinge of nostalgia for the old days.

974
01:16:57.763 --> 01:17:00.057
But back then, it was a little bit different.

975
01:17:00.223 --> 01:17:03.226
You see, when l was an Angel...

976
01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.519
...we used guns.

977
01:17:29.791 --> 01:17:31.835
Sorry, Charlie.

978
01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.028
Hello, Angels.

979
01:18:01.944 --> 01:18:04.113
Good evening, Charlie.

980
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.074
l love the new office.

981
01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:07.474
Madison, is that you?

982
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.851
where are the Angels?

983
01:18:08.993 --> 01:18:11.579
l'm sure there's three more where they came from.

984
01:18:11.745 --> 01:18:14.164
Madison, what have you done?

985
01:18:14.331 --> 01:18:16.516
We're just having a little fun.

986
01:18:16.543 --> 01:18:19.361
You shouldn't worry yourself, Charlie.

987
01:18:19.544 --> 01:18:21.171
You've never had trouble...

988
01:18:21.379 --> 01:18:23.756
...finding someone to give their life for you.

989
01:18:23.964 --> 01:18:27.678
Hurting the Angels doesn't prove you're the best.

990
01:18:27.704 --> 01:18:28.743
You know that.

991
01:18:29.011 --> 01:18:30.136
Do l?

992
01:18:30.345 --> 01:18:33.348
Madison, you were never able to accept that this agency...

993
01:18:33.556 --> 01:18:36.393
... is about teamwork.
w e're a family. we do--

994
01:18:36.643 --> 01:18:39.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, l know.

995
01:18:39.076 --> 01:18:40.712
Angels forever.

996
01:18:40.854 --> 01:18:43.524
l've heard the sales pitch.

997
01:18:46.235 --> 01:18:48.778
lt was very seductive...

998
01:18:50.238 --> 01:18:51.864
...once.

999
01:18:52.073 --> 01:18:55.827
Madison, you deliberately went rogue on the DeSoto case...

1000
01:18:55.992 --> 01:18:59.329
...and put your fellow Angels in danger.

1001
01:18:59.538 --> 01:19:01.414
when we finally got you out of there...

1002
01:19:01.623 --> 01:19:05.459
...you were wounded so badly, we thought we might lose you.

1003
01:19:05.918 --> 01:19:08.045
You did lose me.

1004
01:19:08.295 --> 01:19:11.632
You see, being an Angel wasn't fulfilling my destiny.

1005
01:19:11.799 --> 01:19:14.175
lt was keeping me from it.

1006
01:19:14.343 --> 01:19:16.803
Your destiny is yet to be written.

1007
01:19:17.011 --> 01:19:19.222
Do not do this, Madison.

1008
01:19:19.389 --> 01:19:23.642
Taking the lives of innocent people is not the answer.

1009
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:27.855
There must be something in you that's still good.

1010
01:19:35.278 --> 01:19:38.364
l was never good.

1011
01:19:41.951 --> 01:19:44.286
l was great.

1012
01:20:10.184 --> 01:20:13.687
Damn. What a bitch!

1013
01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:40.169
You guys, we have to outthink Madison.

1014
01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:43.297
No matter what we do, she's always two steps ahead of us.

1015
01:20:43.463 --> 01:20:46.758
-She's selling the list off tonight, 8:00.
-But where?

1016
01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:49.343
-Nat, what else did Carter say?
-Okay.

1017
01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.929
'Take the stars beyond the galaxy.'

1018
01:20:52.095 --> 01:20:53.932
lt's safe to say it's on this planet.

1019
01:20:54.097 --> 01:20:58.809
'Take shore to hope and stop on a stair.'

1020
01:20:59.519 --> 01:21:01.614
There's a Hope Street downtown.

1021
01:21:01.641 --> 01:21:03.465
But no shore for miles.

1022
01:21:03.898 --> 01:21:05.650
A stair.

1023
01:21:07.193 --> 01:21:09.194
Astaire!

1024
01:21:10.905 --> 01:21:12.572
Astaire?

1025
01:21:12.739 --> 01:21:14.032
Astaire!

1026
01:21:14.199 --> 01:21:16.201
-Possible concussion.
-l'm worried.

1027
01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:20.163
Guys, the stars.
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

1028
01:21:20.663 --> 01:21:23.374
Beyond the Galaxy Theatre.

1029
01:21:23.541 --> 01:21:26.710
There's Dinah Shore, Bob Hope and Fred Astaire.

1030
01:21:26.876 --> 01:21:29.379
-Nice, Nat.
-Yeah!

1031
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.516
l think she's trying to kill us.

1032
01:22:05.411 --> 01:22:06.410
l can't believe it.

1033
01:22:06.437 --> 01:22:07.855
We are here in Hollywood.

1034
01:22:07.997 --> 01:22:09.872
-Angels?
-l knew we were gonna do it--

1035
01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.374
-Shut up, damn it!
-What?

1036
01:22:11.542 --> 01:22:13.084
l mean, not you, Mama. Sorry.

1037
01:22:13.251 --> 01:22:15.031
Have you lost your mind?

1038
01:22:15.058 --> 01:22:16.614
Yeah. l mean, no.

1039
01:22:16.754 --> 01:22:18.339
We gonna talk about this later.

1040
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:32.059
Diablo Cartel

1041
01:22:33.102 --> 01:22:34.895
Tanaka Yakuza

1042
01:22:39.482 --> 01:22:41.443
Antonioni Crime Family

1043
01:22:42.402 --> 01:22:45.989
-Welcome to the Guinness World of--
-Shut it.

1044
01:22:46.323 --> 01:22:48.032
Give us the map.

1045
01:23:33.322 --> 01:23:35.866
Yahtzee!

1046
01:23:41.287 --> 01:23:44.540
Jason! Jason!

1047
01:23:45.667 --> 01:23:46.709
Jason!

1048
01:23:47.543 --> 01:23:49.503
l love you!

1049
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.610
l hear the sequel's insane.

1050
01:23:56.636 --> 01:23:57.994
First one was a classic.

1051
01:23:58.135 --> 01:23:59.178
Button your jacket.

1052
01:23:59.346 --> 01:24:00.680
-What?
-Button your jacket.

1053
01:24:42.007 --> 01:24:44.927
The VlP gathering is on the top floor.

1054
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:50.110
You're under arrest for conspiracy to obstruct justice.

1055
01:25:50.277 --> 01:25:51.987
Freeze!

1056
01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:44.575
The Kleinhardt gambit.

1057
01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:45.610
Classic.

1058
01:26:45.636 --> 01:26:48.938
And apparently still effective.

1059
01:26:57.962 --> 01:27:01.215
We never used to wear Kevlar till l took three in the chest.

1060
01:27:01.589 --> 01:27:04.592
On the DeSoto case!
We know!

1061
01:27:09.514 --> 01:27:11.808
Don't tell me you forgot about...

1062
01:27:12.224 --> 01:27:14.351
...plan B.

1063
01:27:19.773 --> 01:27:22.650
l'd recognize that arse anywhere, you piece of sh--!

1064
01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:33.743
Bring it on, bitch.

1065
01:29:09.828 --> 01:29:11.622
Say something.

1066
01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:22.924
Mind if l cut in?

1067
01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:24.884
No!

1088
01:30:47.291 --> 01:30:49.375
The premiere should be a blast.

1089
01:31:04.472 --> 01:31:06.725
Bosley, plan B!

1090
01:31:06.932 --> 01:31:08.392
lt's raining white women!

1091
01:31:14.356 --> 01:31:17.776
Plan B stands for ' plan Bosley.'

1092
01:31:23.031 --> 01:31:24.740
Yeah!

1093
01:31:25.616 --> 01:31:28.285
Get that bitch!
 Get that bitch!

1094
01:31:28.577 --> 01:31:32.789
Wow. They really went all out for this thing. Okay!

1095
01:32:20.873 --> 01:32:21.916
Dylan!

1096
01:32:27.546 --> 01:32:29.381
Alex!

1097
01:33:49.493 --> 01:33:51.203
This is it. You ready?

1098
01:33:52.872 --> 01:33:54.498
Are you?

1099
01:34:09.219 --> 01:34:10.595
Kill...

1100
01:34:10.888 --> 01:34:12.848
...or be killed.

1101
01:34:13.306 --> 01:34:15.224
Exciting, isn't it?

1102
01:34:16.434 --> 01:34:17.851
Who are you?

1103
01:34:19.646 --> 01:34:22.481
You want to know who l am, Natalie?

1104
01:34:23.315 --> 01:34:25.400
Then you look inside your own heart.

1105
01:34:26.026 --> 01:34:28.070
No, Madison.

1106
01:34:28.402 --> 01:34:30.237
l'm nothing like you.

1107
01:34:31.573 --> 01:34:33.741
l have something you'll never have.

1108
01:34:42.582 --> 01:34:44.960
And what's that?

1109
01:34:49.255 --> 01:34:51.090
Friends.

1110
01:35:20.658 --> 01:35:23.577
-Enjoy heaven.
-Go to hell.

1111
01:35:58.524 --> 01:36:00.401
She is so fired.

1112
01:36:16.206 --> 01:36:17.958
Party time.

1113
01:36:28.301 --> 01:36:29.469
-Angels!
-Bosley!

1114
01:36:29.635 --> 01:36:31.471
Angels!

1115
01:36:33.473 --> 01:36:35.766
-You all get that squirrel-flying lady?
-Yeah!

1116
01:36:35.932 --> 01:36:37.309
-Did you scratch her?
-Yeah!

1117
01:36:37.476 --> 01:36:40.084
You kick her?
You kicked her kung fu ass?

1118
01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:41.254
Mama, l told you!

1119
01:36:41.396 --> 01:36:42.814
l know it!

1120
01:36:43.065 --> 01:36:46.400
-We couldn't have done it without you.
-Never!

1121
01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.486
-You hear that, Mama?
-l heard it.

1122
01:36:48.652 --> 01:36:51.697
l've always known my baby boy was a genius!

1123
01:36:51.863 --> 01:36:54.033
Why you give my room away, then, Mama?

1124
01:36:54.199 --> 01:36:57.118
l'll tell you why. Max?

1125
01:36:57.285 --> 01:36:59.579
Yeah? l'm a Bosley now!

1126
01:36:59.745 --> 01:37:02.623
-Max Bosley!
-l love Max Bosley!

1127
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:04.750
-Boy, you did it!
-Hallelujah!

1128
01:37:04.918 --> 01:37:07.419
Daddy! One second. Daddy!

1129
01:37:07.585 --> 01:37:10.046
Darling! You made it!

1130
01:37:10.214 --> 01:37:11.841
We just got done.

1131
01:37:11.867 --> 01:37:14.451
Another satisfied client.

1132
01:37:14.717 --> 01:37:17.052
We finished her off sooner than we thought.

1133
01:37:17.220 --> 01:37:18.888
-Her?
-lt was a woman this time.

1134
01:37:19.054 --> 01:37:22.265
We had to triple-team her, but we finally got her on her back!

1135
01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:26.978
Well done!

1136
01:37:27.353 --> 01:37:29.438
No, no, no!

1137
01:37:32.525 --> 01:37:35.443
-Jason!
-Alex. You made it.

1138
01:37:36.195 --> 01:37:37.569
No, no, no! l know.

1139
01:37:37.595 --> 01:37:39.765
We're on a time-out, l know.

1140
01:37:39.906 --> 01:37:41.878
Time-out's over, baby.

1141
01:37:41.904 --> 01:37:44.144
We're back in the game!

1142
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:52.501
Ferret.

1143
01:38:04.553 --> 01:38:07.597
l know you wanted to wait and everything, but--

1144
01:38:11.142 --> 01:38:14.895
-You really look beautiful.
-Thanks, Pete.

1145
01:38:15.062 --> 01:38:18.149
l've been wanting to ask you this for a long time.

1146
01:38:18.648 --> 01:38:20.984
So here goes.

1147
01:38:21.985 --> 01:38:23.736
Pete.

1148
01:38:35.664 --> 01:38:38.584
-Spike?
-Yeah. A puppy.

1149
01:38:38.749 --> 01:38:40.668
A puppy?

1150
01:38:40.835 --> 01:38:43.921
-ls that okay? l know it's a big step.
-Yes!

1151
01:38:44.171 --> 01:38:45.631
l already got him.

1152
01:38:45.797 --> 01:38:48.008
-You did?
-Yeah.

1153
01:38:52.304 --> 01:38:54.471
Dylan! Dylan!

1154
01:38:54.848 --> 01:38:56.474
Guess what.

1155
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:58.517
Pete and l have something to tell you.

1156
01:38:58.684 --> 01:39:00.019
-Really?
-We're gonna get--

1157
01:39:00.186 --> 01:39:03.772
-You're gonna get what?
-A puppy!

1158
01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:06.399
-A puppy! That's great!
-Yes.

1159
01:39:06.608 --> 01:39:08.401
-l already got him.
-You did.

1160
01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:10.904
-Awesome!
-His name is Spike!

1161
01:39:11.237 --> 01:39:12.686
So you're not leaving?

1162
01:39:12.713 --> 01:39:14.557
No! Of course, you guys.

1163
01:39:14.741 --> 01:39:17.212
l get to kick butt with my two best friends.

1164
01:39:17.238 --> 01:39:18.810
You think l'd give that up?

1165
01:39:18.952 --> 01:39:20.871
No!

1166
01:39:21.246 --> 01:39:22.623
What about you, Dylan?

1167
01:39:22.788 --> 01:39:25.292
With O'Grady out, you can go back to your old life.

1168
01:39:25.499 --> 01:39:26.955
Are you kidding?

1169
01:39:26.981 --> 01:39:28.527
This is my life.

1170
01:39:28.711 --> 01:39:30.821
What about you, neurosurgeon?

1171
01:39:30.848 --> 01:39:32.448
lt's a no-brainer!

1172
01:39:32.631 --> 01:39:34.090
l love our family!

1173
01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:36.843
l love our family!

1174
01:39:54.275 --> 01:39:55.902
God!

1175
01:40:00.238 --> 01:40:03.492
And l know we agreed to take things slow.

1176
01:40:04.116 --> 01:40:06.786
-Yeah?
-But....

1177
01:40:06.954 --> 01:40:08.622
-You--
-Sorry.

1178
01:40:17.254 --> 01:40:19.965
There's an ember in my ass.

1179
01:40:26.929 --> 01:40:29.223
We should get this to the lab and analyse it.

1180
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:31.308
Yeah, just crawl right up in there.

1181
01:40:31.475 --> 01:40:33.142

1182
01:40:42.734 --> 01:40:44.820

1183
01:40:47.072 --> 01:40:48.991
Let me see your patch.

1184
01:40:57.206 --> 01:40:58.916

l'm on fire!

1188
01:41:17.683 --> 01:41:19.267
Look around.

1189
01:41:19.435 --> 01:41:21.019
Over your right shoulder.

1190
01:41:21.185 --> 01:41:23.479
ls somebody coming up behind me?

1191
01:46:42.846 --> 01:46:45.181

1192
01:46:45.348 --> 01:46:47.141
