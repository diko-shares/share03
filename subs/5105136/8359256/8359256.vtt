Uh, tequila, please.

28
00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:47.902
Ugh, just three more weeks
and I get to peace out
of this God-forsaken island.

29
00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:49.904
I'll be a Hoya
and I won't ever have to deal

30
00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:52.607
with anyone thinking
my father's factory
is gonna blow up

31
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.308
-and poison everyone
to the point of madness.
-[chuckles]

32
00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:58.211
-Although that would be
kind of cool, right?
-[chuckles]

33
00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:01.716
-Provided we were
at a somewhat safe distance.
-[giggles] No.

34
00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:03.985
Well, fuck anybody
who thinks that anyway.

35
00:03:04.118 --> 00:03:05.687
Uh, it's easy for you to say.

36
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.089
Everyone hasn't been calling you
Poison Paige your whole life.

37
00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:12.694
Ah, so your family wealth
comes from some old, secluded,
mysterious factory

38
00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:16.296
-that looks like a 1900 prison.
-[laughs]

39
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.734
-Yeah, pretty much.
-And your father's
probably manufacturing

40
00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.570
zombie rage gas
or chemical weapons
for the government.

41
00:03:22.704 --> 00:03:25.606
Or worse.
Father never talks about it.

42
00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.375
-Girl, I'm sure it's fine.
-Yeah.

43
00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.410
Fine. People think that it leaks

44
00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:32.613
and makes you crazy
with fits of rage.

45
00:03:32.747 --> 00:03:34.582
Hmm. You do have
a bit of a temper.

46

Seriously, though,
I just cannot wait to graduate

49
00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:44.625
so people can stop accusing me
of having Paige Rage.

50
00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.627
-It is clever, though.

I don't smell smoke.

61
00:04:10.785 --> 00:04:13.955
-Looks like the old Paige Plant
finally blew up.
-No way.

62
00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.289

strikes again.

-You guys are fucking jerks.
-Come on.
It's a classic fog in the bar

67

their family factory
went all Chernoball.

-Chernobyl.
I forget how to say it.

Uh, yeah, actually,
it's, uh, it's just like that.

72

is the beauty and the beast.

after realizing
this long-distance thing

137
00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:29.650
was a huge mistake.

you guys have been dating
for, like, nine months.

Well, um, okay.

142
00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:43.130
We actually tried
a couple of weeks ago.

143
00:07:43.264 --> 00:07:44.432
-What? Really?
-Yeah,

144
00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:46.667
but, uh,
it didn't really work out.

He, uh-- We were drinking,

146
00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:50.638
and I guess
when a guy drinks too much,

147
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:53.007
-it doesn't work.
-Oh.

148
00:07:55.443 --> 00:07:56.811
-Oh.
-Yeah.

149
00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.779
Um, it was for the best, though.

150
00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:00.147
Whose best?

00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:01.983
I don't know. Ours.

152
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:04.819
Well, what did you guys do?

153
00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:07.121
-Do?
-Yeah, like...

154
00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.657
-Did you blow him?
-[laughs]

155
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.359
Nope, not that.

156
00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:12.927
Well, you should've
just blown him.

157
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.062
Somehow that always works out.

158
00:08:15.696 --> 00:08:18.466
Um, I tried to give him
a hand job.

159
00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:20.101
-Yeah? Did that...?
-Um, no.

160
00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:23.371
It turns out he is a lot better
at it than I am, so.

161
00:08:23.504 --> 00:08:26.374
-Yikes. Well, practice.
-Yeah.

162
00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:27.808
-Mm.
-I think by next fall,

163
00:08:27.942 --> 00:08:29.310
whether you're still wearing
white or not,

164
00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:30.878
you guys should be able
to work something out

165
00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:32.313
before you start dating
college guys.

166
00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:34.315
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Just go get your shit.

167
00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:38.019
Okay, okay. Oh, maybe keep JK
away from the booze.

168
00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:38.953

I didn't mean anything by that.

JK, will you help me reach?

512
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.520
Yeah, ready?

-Yeah.

-Yo, Blake,
check that AC in there.

we can't use the fan in there.

-God, come on, Blake.
-[Blake] Sorry, nature call.

-Yeah, you should
have let it ring.
-Can't.

00:28:26.977 --> 00:28:28.479
Guess we are not safe out there

522
00:28:28.613 --> 00:28:29.980
and now we're not safe in here.

523
00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:31.949
Just go get your girlfriend
and make sure

524
00:28:32.082 --> 00:28:33.652
the windows upstairs are sealed.

525
00:28:33.784 --> 00:28:34.885
Here, take this.

What were you doing?

534
00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:30.642
Closing up the doors
and windows.

535
00:29:30.774 --> 00:29:31.875
Hmm?

00:29:33.444 --> 00:29:34.945

Did you guys stop again
for carrots?

No, no carrots.
Just tight windows.

541
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.072
I think we're good,
considering...

542
00:30:02.206 --> 00:30:06.043
No, we're not. Look.

543
00:30:19.923 --> 00:30:20.824
We're fucked,

aren't we?

545
00:30:22.627 --> 00:30:24.461
Oh, my God, we're gonna die
in this fucking house!

546
00:30:24.596 --> 00:30:26.463
No way, if this place
is sealed up tight.

547

Even if we were sealed in,
which we're probably not,

run out of air.
-Enough with the oxygen, Cassie.

549

I'm sorry, okay? But I'm just
about at the end of my rope.

550
00:30:34.938 --> 00:30:35.806
Then find more rope.

551
00:30:35.939 --> 00:30:37.509
What else can we do?

552
00:30:38.375 --> 00:30:40.244
-What do you mean?
-Just because we're trapped

553
00:30:40.377 --> 00:30:42.514
and it's hopeless doesn't mean
we should stop trying things.

554
00:30:42.647 --> 00:30:46.350
No, that is what it means.
Besides, we've done everything
we can do.

555
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.452
There's no phones,
there's no way out

556
00:30:48.586 --> 00:30:50.354
and there's no help
coming our way.

557
00:30:50.487 --> 00:30:53.123
-What does it do?
-[JK] What?

558
00:30:53.257 --> 00:30:55.560
The gas. The poisoned fog.
What does it do?

559
00:30:55.694 --> 00:30:56.661
Hey, she doesn't know.

560
00:30:56.795 --> 00:30:57.796
Maybe it doesn't kill you.

561
00:30:57.928 --> 00:30:58.996
Maybe it just makes you crazy.

562
00:30:59.129 --> 00:31:00.431
That's what people say, right?

563
00:31:00.565 --> 00:31:01.498
Baseless rumors.

-[dramatic musical sting]
-I really don't know. I don't.

all the wealth, right?

00:31:15.112 --> 00:31:18.115
-Yet they don't sell anything.
-What?

571
00:31:18.248 --> 00:31:20.184
Well, the Paige Plant
has never made anything

572
00:31:20.317 --> 00:31:22.620
that we can see or, or, or buy.

573
00:31:24.054 --> 00:31:25.356
So?

574
00:31:25.489 --> 00:31:27.157
So who buys it?

575
00:31:27.692 --> 00:31:30.994
-I don't know.
-Okay, then it's got to be
chemical weapons

-or something awful.
-It's got to be the US.

577

I mean, they would know
about it, if not, right?

578
00:31:35.199 --> 00:31:36.467
This factory's
been here forever.

579
00:31:36.601 --> 00:31:38.035
Yeah, but the siren
stopped, so--

580
00:31:38.168 --> 00:31:40.337
Or the poison gas
ate through the siren.

581
00:31:40.471 --> 00:31:41.939
Or killed the people
ringing them.

582
00:31:42.072 --> 00:31:43.708
It's not eating
through the walls

583
00:31:43.842 --> 00:31:44.975
or killing us.

584
00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.410
Yet.

585
00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:48.513
So what?

586
00:31:48.646 --> 00:31:49.947
We should just
embrace the horror

587
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.449
and cry and make peace with God?

588
00:31:52.584 --> 00:31:53.484

we need to think about
what's best for the group.

You do know, and now
Reegan has killed us all.

673
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:56.400
I didn't kill anybody.
If anything,
her father killed us all.

674
00:34:56.534 --> 00:34:57.735
-Hey!
-[Reegan] Sorry.

675
00:34:58.435 --> 00:35:00.070
Reegan. What the fuck?
Let us in now!

676
00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:02.139
Do not open that door!
I'm serious.

677
00:35:02.272 --> 00:35:03.641
Let them in now!

678
00:35:03.775 --> 00:35:05.009
Open the door, Reegan!

679
00:35:05.142 --> 00:35:06.578
-[Blake] Stop!
-Whoa!

680
00:35:06.711 --> 00:35:08.546
Why do you have
a gun in my house?

681
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.114
-I thought it was
your uncle's house.
-What the fuck ever?

682
00:35:11.248 --> 00:35:13.250
Okay, Blake,
just put the gun down, okay?

683
00:35:13.383 --> 00:35:14.953
Oh, you're all losing it.

684
00:35:15.085 --> 00:35:16.286
[scoffs]
We're losing it?

685
00:35:16.654 --> 00:35:19.089
Quick recap. You're waving a gun

686
00:35:19.222 --> 00:35:20.324
-in this house.
-Yeah.

687
00:35:20.457 --> 00:35:21.926
You can't shoot fog.

688
00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.427
-[gun cocks]
-[ominous music]

689
00:35:23.928 --> 00:35:25.295
Point it somewhere else.

690
00:35:25.429 --> 00:35:26.698
Not if she's gonna
open the door.

691
00:35:26.831 --> 00:35:27.732
Blake.

692
00:35:28.365 --> 00:35:29.801
Open the door.

693
00:35:30.434 --> 00:35:34.271
Hey! Okay, Tanner, Blake,
everyone, here's the deal.

694
00:35:34.404 --> 00:35:36.641
We, we, we don't know
what's out there.

695
00:35:38.009 --> 00:35:40.044
And we can all agree
that if whatever it is

696
00:35:40.177 --> 00:35:43.748
can get you or get on you
or contaminate you
or anything...

697
00:35:44.549 --> 00:35:46.718
...it's already done it
to at least Tanner and Chelsea.

698
00:35:47.117 --> 00:35:50.454
But, but if, and this is a big
if, if we're safe in here,

699
00:35:50.588 --> 00:35:52.557
then, then they're safe
out there.

700
00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:53.591
Reegan.

701
00:35:54.257 --> 00:35:55.893
So now, we're all
equally sealed inside.

702
00:35:56.027 --> 00:35:59.597
The best we can be
equally safe or unsafe.

703
00:36:00.064 --> 00:36:01.666
Reegan, unlock this door.

704
00:36:01.799 --> 00:36:04.702
Tanner, if you were somehow
worse off having been in the fog

705
00:36:04.836 --> 00:36:06.838
and we can somehow not be
as worse as you

706
00:36:06.971 --> 00:36:08.873
because you're out there
and we're in here,

707
00:36:09.007 --> 00:36:11.743
then it's only fair
that you stay put.

708
00:36:11.876 --> 00:36:13.544
Jesus, we're fine! Fuck!

709
00:36:13.678 --> 00:36:15.212
[Chelsea]
Hey, hey! Calm down.

710
00:36:16.047 --> 00:36:18.315
They're gonna think
the fog made you crazy.

711
00:36:20.852 --> 00:36:21.753
Maybe it did.

712
00:36:23.087 --> 00:36:24.856
We're gonna make it, okay?

713
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.759
We don't even know what this is.

714
00:36:27.892 --> 00:36:29.292
[dramatic musical sting]

715
00:36:34.632 --> 00:36:36.266
I'm gonna walk away
from the door now.

716
00:36:36.801 --> 00:36:38.435
Georgia, you're not gonna try
and open it.

717
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:40.038
And, Blake, you're gonna
do me a favor

718
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.271
and put the fucking gun away

719
00:36:41.405 --> 00:36:42.674
before you shoot your eye out.

720
00:36:42.807 --> 00:36:45.175
God, we shouldn't
just leave them out there.

721
00:36:45.308 --> 00:36:46.577
No, they're fine.

722
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.312
They're no more fucked
than us now.

723
00:36:49.446 --> 00:36:51.348
-Which is severely.
-They were in the fog.

724
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:53.017
-The fog never touched us.
-[JK] Wait, babe.

725
00:36:53.151 --> 00:36:54.886
-The fog never
touched you guys, right?
-[Reegan] No, no.

726
00:36:55.019 --> 00:36:57.822
Georgia here is a real peach.
She drives like a dream.

727
00:37:00.825 --> 00:37:02.093
[sighs]
I wouldn't fucking know.

728
00:37:02.225 --> 00:37:03.594
Ugh, this is a nightmare.

729
00:37:04.461 --> 00:37:06.964
Well, uh,
since we're all definitely
going to die tonight,

730
00:37:07.098 --> 00:37:09.701
I am definitely going to
get drunk before we do.

731
00:37:09.834 --> 00:37:11.569
Maybe you put the safety
on that first, eh?

732
00:37:12.036 --> 00:37:13.838
At least you got laid
on your last night on Earth.

733
00:37:13.971 --> 00:37:15.205
Hey!

734
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.374
What? Okay, I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's kind of true.

735
00:37:17.508 --> 00:37:20.410
-Wow.
-But, hey, it's not too late.

736
00:37:20.845 --> 00:37:23.480
Easy, sailor. I didn't realize
you were going off to war.

737
00:37:23.614 --> 00:37:25.248
Let me just lift up my skirt.

738
00:37:25.382 --> 00:37:26.517
You know what? That would not be
the worst thing.

739
00:37:26.651 --> 00:37:28.619
Oh, God, you are
an unbelievable asshole.

740
00:37:28.753 --> 00:37:30.822
I actually believe the asshole
that he is.

741
00:37:31.354 --> 00:37:33.423
We are trapped here
by God knows what,

742
00:37:33.558 --> 00:37:35.325
and you want to use that
as an excuse to get laid.

743
00:37:35.459 --> 00:37:37.562
-Is that it?
-You know what? You know,
you know what? That's it.

744
00:37:37.695 --> 00:37:39.864
-That's exactly it.
-The man has a point.

745
00:37:39.997 --> 00:37:40.965
Fuck off, Blake.

746
00:37:41.899 --> 00:37:44.902
JK, I cannot believe
we're having this conversation

747
00:37:45.036 --> 00:37:46.738
right now, and here.

748
00:37:46.871 --> 00:37:48.773
-We're amongst friends.
-Are we?

749
00:37:48.906 --> 00:37:50.608
Yeah. What? Do you want
to take this conversation
upstairs?

750
00:37:50.742 --> 00:37:53.044
-Yeah, one of the bedrooms,
perhaps.
-Fuck off, Blake.

751
00:37:53.678 --> 00:37:56.279
And no, I don't want
to take this conversation
upstairs.

752
00:37:56.413 --> 00:37:58.549
[sighs] Just fuck
your boyfriend, Georgia!

753
00:37:58.683 --> 00:38:00.852
God, Cassie, stay out of this.

754
00:38:01.284 --> 00:38:03.020
-Okay.
-[Reegan] No. [scoffs]

755
00:38:03.154 --> 00:38:05.656
She's right, Georgia.
You should just
fuck your boyfriend,

756
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.658
even if he is being
a dick about it.

757
00:38:08.659 --> 00:38:11.328
-Just stop.
-No, I, I'm, I'm not gonna stop.

758
00:38:11.696 --> 00:38:13.798
You want everything
to be perfect.

759
00:38:13.931 --> 00:38:17.201
You expect it to be
because that's what you think

760
00:38:17.334 --> 00:38:18.803
life has to be.

761
00:38:20.738 --> 00:38:22.305
God, and you,
you have this perfect life.

762
00:38:22.439 --> 00:38:24.341
You, you have
your perfect family,

763
00:38:24.474 --> 00:38:25.510
and you always look perfect.

764
00:38:25.643 --> 00:38:27.211
And you dress perfect

765
00:38:27.344 --> 00:38:28.746
and you have your perfect car,

766
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.548
and you're going
to perfect school,

767
00:38:30.681 --> 00:38:32.282
and you have
the perfect boyfriend.

768
00:38:32.415 --> 00:38:35.653
Perfect, perfect, perfect.
Everything has to be perfect.

769
00:38:35.787 --> 00:38:38.488
And, and now Georgia
wants the perfect fuck, too,

770
00:38:38.623 --> 00:38:40.958
before she'll even consider
giving up her virginity.

771
00:38:41.092 --> 00:38:42.059
[chuckles]

772
00:38:43.094 --> 00:38:44.028
God. And you know what?

773
00:38:44.896 --> 00:38:47.231
It's not all
gonna be perfect, is it?

774
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:52.570
Even knowing
that we may all die tonight,
which totally sucks by the way,

775
00:38:52.703 --> 00:38:55.139
it somehow made worse
by the fact that we may all die

776
00:38:55.273 --> 00:38:59.210
from being exposed to the source
of all your perfectness.

777
00:38:59.342 --> 00:39:00.511
[dramatic musical sting]

778
00:39:00.645 --> 00:39:02.445
Even knowing
you would never dream

779
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.414
of giving up
your precious virginity

780
00:39:04.549 --> 00:39:08.451
for no other reason
than the fact
that it won't be perfect.

781
00:39:09.086 --> 00:39:09.987
[chuckles]

782
00:39:10.487 --> 00:39:12.824
Well, uh, I'll save you
the suspense.

783
00:39:13.356 --> 00:39:18.229
It's not going to be perfect.
It never is,
and it doesn't need to be.

784
00:39:18.896 --> 00:39:22.066
-I'm not like you, Reegan.
-[Reegan] Like me?

785
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.937
You, you, you're not like me?
[chuckles]

786
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.639
You're right.
I, I am not perfect.

787
00:39:28.773 --> 00:39:30.942
And, and given the
circumstances, perfect or not,

788
00:39:31.075 --> 00:39:34.444
I, yeah, I,
I would fuck my boyfriend.

789
00:39:34.579 --> 00:39:36.647
We might all die tonight.

790
00:39:39.884 --> 00:39:41.652
God. And you know what?
I wish I...

791
00:39:42.887 --> 00:39:43.486
Never mind.

792
00:39:43.621 --> 00:39:45.455
You are such a slut.

793
00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.158
You don't understand at all.

794
00:39:47.525 --> 00:39:51.361
[chuckles] Just because
I wouldn't date a guy
for almost a year

795
00:39:51.494 --> 00:39:53.998
and still not know
whether or not
I want to fuck him

796
00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:55.700
doesn't make me a slut.

797
00:39:56.267 --> 00:39:57.367
God.

798
00:39:59.837 --> 00:40:01.404
You're supposed to be my friend.

799
00:40:02.073 --> 00:40:03.841
You, you know what?
An another thing,

800
00:40:03.975 --> 00:40:06.476
wanting to be held
and, and kissed

801
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:08.478
and, and share some kind
of human connection

802
00:40:08.613 --> 00:40:10.748
when you're scared
and, and lonely,

803
00:40:10.882 --> 00:40:12.884
and might die some horrible,
gruesome death

804
00:40:13.017 --> 00:40:16.153
also doesn't make me a slut,
Your Highness.

805
00:40:17.054 --> 00:40:19.590
God. And you know what?
I, I'm not going to apologize

806
00:40:19.724 --> 00:40:22.126
for wishing I had someone here
who wanted me.

807
00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:29.033
And nor will I apologize that
it's annoying that you do
and you don't even want it.

808
00:40:29.466 --> 00:40:31.869
God, just fuck your boyfriend,
Georgia.

809
00:40:32.003 --> 00:40:35.506
It's not gonna be perfect,
but it'll be normal.

810
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.941
I would.

811
00:41:09.076 --> 00:41:12.280
If you want to fuck JK so bad,
then maybe you should.

812
00:41:13.014 --> 00:41:14.615
We're all gonna die
in here anyway, right?

813
00:41:14.749 --> 00:41:16.050
At least some of us
can die happy.

814
00:41:16.183 --> 00:41:17.919
-That's not what I meant.
-Isn't it?

815
00:41:18.052 --> 00:41:19.553
Okay, you know what, Reegan?
We don't even need--

816
00:41:19.687 --> 00:41:21.289
Don't you dare even say it.

817
00:41:21.421 --> 00:41:22.556
Fucking say what?

818
00:41:22.957 --> 00:41:25.826
Say that we've been dating
for nine months, 14 days

819
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.963
and what, what, two hours
and you still don't want
to sleep with me?

820
00:41:29.096 --> 00:41:31.832
-Stop.
-Look, and even if we,
if we don't die tonight,

821
00:41:31.966 --> 00:41:33.668
then we'll just spend
next Christmas breaking up

822
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:35.202
because we spent
a semester realizing

823
00:41:35.336 --> 00:41:37.872
that the long distance
doesn't even fucking work.

824
00:41:38.005 --> 00:41:39.307
[Reegan]
That's exactly
what she said earlier.

825
00:41:39.439 --> 00:41:40.473
[Georgia]
God, Reegan, you bitch.

826
00:41:40.608 --> 00:41:42.209
[JK]
I fucking knew it.

827
00:41:44.412 --> 00:41:45.746
[Reegan]
Come on, JK.

828
00:41:49.216 --> 00:41:50.351
We're gonna die anyway.

829
00:41:50.483 --> 00:41:51.686
[Georgia]
God, I'm never gonna speak

830
00:41:51.819 --> 00:41:53.453
to either one of you ever again.

831
00:41:53.921 --> 00:41:56.456
I swear to fucking Christ
never again!

832
00:41:57.558 --> 00:41:59.226
Well, that won't be
for very long.

833
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.661
Thanks to you and your father.

834
00:42:00.795 --> 00:42:01.963
Now, will it?

835
00:42:06.033 --> 00:42:08.636
-[Georgia sobbing]
-[thunder rumbling]

836
00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:12.606
[rain pattering]

837
00:42:17.545 --> 00:42:20.480
[ominous music]

838

00:52:34.394 --> 00:52:35.897
-[Georgia sobbing]
-Shit.

1012
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.800
What the fuck did she do?
What the fuck was she thinking?

1013
00:52:38.933 --> 00:52:39.734
Shit.

1014
00:52:39.867 --> 00:52:41.168
[panting]

1015
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:44.371
It's real. It's real.

1016
00:52:45.573 --> 00:52:49.309
Fuck. This fog's gonna
make us all crazy.

1017
00:52:49.443 --> 00:52:51.713
Or it already is. We're gonna
tear each other apart.

1018
00:52:51.846 --> 00:52:53.047
Not, not, not us.

1019
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.616
No, no, no.
It didn't get us, okay?

1020
00:52:54.749 --> 00:52:57.417
Just, just Georgia and,
and Reegan were...

1021
00:52:57.986 --> 00:53:00.888
They were affected.
The fog must have got 'em. No.

1022
00:53:01.022 --> 00:53:02.289
Or it's already in here.

1023
00:53:03.024 --> 00:53:04.959
No. No, no, we're fine.

1024
00:53:05.093 --> 00:53:06.628
We're fine. We're fine.

1025
00:53:07.729 --> 00:53:09.063
[thuds on door]

1026
00:53:09.463 --> 00:53:10.798
You think this is fine?

1027
00:53:15.435 --> 00:53:17.538
-I don't feel well.
-Listen to me. Hey, listen.

1028
00:53:17.939 --> 00:53:22.309
The fog, it got...
It got Georgia.

1029
00:53:22.442 --> 00:53:25.245
Maybe, maybe Tanner and Chelsea,
but not us, okay?

1030
00:53:25.379 --> 00:53:27.314
Yeah, yeah.
We, we've been together
this entire time. We're fine.

1031
00:53:27.447 --> 00:53:29.483
Unlock this door
or I'm breaking it down.

1032
00:53:29.617 --> 00:53:31.819
-We are fine.
-If you smash down that door

1033
00:53:31.953 --> 00:53:33.353
-you will prove that
you are not fine...
-[gun cocks]

1034
00:53:33.487 --> 00:53:35.222
...and I will shoot you
in the face.

1035
00:53:35.355 --> 00:53:36.456
Fuck.

1036
00:53:37.759 --> 00:53:40.494
[Chelsea]
Tanner. Tanner,
it's not worth it.

1037
00:53:44.164 --> 00:53:44.966
[door closes]

1038
00:53:45.099 --> 00:53:47.467
[muffled straining]

1039
00:53:53.741 --> 00:53:56.711
[muffled sobbing]

1040
00:53:59.013 --> 00:54:01.415
[sobbing]

1041
00:54:03.183 --> 00:54:04.284
Reegan.

1042
00:54:09.256 --> 00:54:11.491
[wind gusting]

1043
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:26.273
[eerie breathing]

1044
00:54:26.406 --> 00:54:28.208
Listen, Reegan didn't lose it.

1045
00:54:28.341 --> 00:54:30.277
-Reegan's dead.
-Yeah, but we're not.

1046
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:31.879
[Chelsea]
Okay, we don't know

1047
00:54:32.013 --> 00:54:33.981
if Georgia and Reegan
were out there in the fog,

1048
00:54:34.115 --> 00:54:36.450
but we were, and we're fine.

1049
00:54:38.452 --> 00:54:42.023
-We gotta get outta here.
-Look, I don't know
what that fog does,

1050
00:54:42.156 --> 00:54:46.060
but maybe, maybe Georgia
was the only one affected.

1051
00:54:46.194 --> 00:54:49.731
Like, maybe she was somehow
already exposed to it.

1052
00:54:55.268 --> 00:54:56.971
I feel like I'm going crazy.

1053
00:54:57.538 --> 00:54:59.774
You're just angry and scared.

1054
00:55:01.441 --> 00:55:02.543
[sighs]

1055
00:55:03.211 --> 00:55:04.212
[JK strains]

1056
00:55:04.344 --> 00:55:06.480
[somber music]

1057
00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:10.518
[JK whispering]

1058
00:55:13.087 --> 00:55:15.022
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1059
00:55:15.757 --> 00:55:16.924

1060
00:55:17.058 --> 00:55:19.292
[wind gusting]

1061
00:55:22.295 --> 00:55:23.396
Fuck.

1062
00:56:00.433 --> 00:56:02.537
I can't let Tanner
and Chelsea in here...

1063
00:56:03.638 --> 00:56:05.773
...no matter what.
You understand that, right?

1064
00:56:05.907 --> 00:56:07.942
[whimpering]

1065
00:56:08.075 --> 00:56:09.644
I'm so scared.

1066
00:56:10.578 --> 00:56:13.247
But you understand, right?

1067
00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.348
[Cassie]
Please, don't hurt them, though.

1068
00:56:16.449 --> 00:56:17.852
I have to protect us.

1069
00:56:19.587 --> 00:56:25.693
First, no matter what,
we have to make it
through these together.

1070
00:56:30.665 --> 00:56:32.934
I really, really like you.

1071
00:56:38.471 --> 00:56:39.941
I really, really like you, too.

1072
00:56:46.446 --> 00:56:47.682
[retches]

1073
00:56:58.025 --> 00:56:59.126
I don't know what to do.

1074
00:57:00.695 --> 00:57:01.963
I think we're super fucked.

1075
00:57:02.096 --> 00:57:04.232
No, no, we are not, okay?

1076
00:57:04.364 --> 00:57:05.666
The three of us are fine.

1077
00:57:08.269 --> 00:57:10.437
-I don't feel fine.
-[Cassie] Don't say that.

1078
00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:11.906
[Blake]
Hey, hey, look at me.

1079
00:57:13.908 --> 00:57:14.809
You're fine.

1080
00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:19.013
Hey. We need to handle Georgia.

1081
00:57:19.479 --> 00:57:22.717
[muffled straining]

1082
00:57:23.985 --> 00:57:25.820
What do you,
what do you mean handle Georgia?

1083
00:57:25.953 --> 00:57:27.755
-JK, think about it.
-Think about what?

1084
00:57:27.889 --> 00:57:29.590
Normal, sweet, perfect Georgia

1085
00:57:29.724 --> 00:57:31.893
just ripped Reegan's throat open
with a fucking bottle.

1086
00:57:32.026 --> 00:57:33.794
-Yeah, we saw that, Blake.
-She's gone.

1087
00:57:33.928 --> 00:57:35.495
Georgia is gone.
She's a monster.

1088
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.064
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1089
00:57:37.198 --> 00:57:39.634
No, man. This fog,
this fog is making you crazy.

1090
00:57:39.767 --> 00:57:41.736
Maybe so. But what now?

1091
00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:43.971
Does it kill her?

1092
00:57:45.039 --> 00:57:45.873
Is it reversible?

1093
00:57:46.439 --> 00:57:48.542
Maybe it is nothing.
Maybe she just lost her shit

1094
00:57:48.676 --> 00:57:51.579
because her best friend
just blew her boyfriend
right in front of her.

1095
00:57:51.712 --> 00:57:56.517
-What is your point, Blake?
-My point...
is that her life is over.

1096
00:57:57.585 --> 00:57:58.853
And we need to end it now.

1097
00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:02.723
We can't do that.

1098
00:58:05.593 --> 00:58:06.861
[Chelsea]
You can't do that.

1099
00:58:06.994 --> 00:58:09.697
Hey, assholes,
don't even say it.

1100
00:58:10.932 --> 00:58:12.867
Am I the only rational
fucking person here

1101
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.502
that realizes
we have to kill her?

1102
00:58:14.635 --> 00:58:16.537
Why don't you
write that sentence out

1103
00:58:16.671 --> 00:58:18.072
and read what you just said?

1104
00:58:18.205 --> 00:58:19.340
I don't need to, Chelsea.

1105
00:58:19.472 --> 00:58:21.175
I know what needs to be done.

1106
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:24.712
-Why?
-Dude, best case scenario,

1107
00:58:24.845 --> 00:58:27.181
she spends the rest of her life
rotting in a prison cell.

1108
00:58:27.315 --> 00:58:29.951
-Maybe an insane asylum.
-Okay, babe, there's that.

1109
00:58:30.084 --> 00:58:32.954
Or she's down there,
she's getting worse.

1110
00:58:33.087 --> 00:58:35.289
And she will come up here
and kill us all.

1111
00:58:35.423 --> 00:58:37.925
-It's not gonna happen.
-No, one of those
is gonna happen.

1112
00:58:38.059 --> 00:58:39.427
Dude, she's handcuffed
to a pipe.

1113
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.895
And she's likely chewing
through her arm

1114
00:58:41.028 --> 00:58:42.730
-as we speak.
-What? What? She's a rat now,

1115
00:58:42.863 --> 00:58:44.532
-is that it?
-Probably something
much worse, yeah.

1116
00:58:44.665 --> 00:58:47.902

[pants]

1120
00:59:10.257 --> 00:59:12.093
JK, she can't just slit
her best friend's throat

1121
00:59:12.226 --> 00:59:13.794
and blame Daddy's
family secret recipe

1122
00:59:13.928 --> 00:59:16.197
and go on with a normal
and happy life.

1123
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:17.365
JK, I like Georgia.

1124
00:59:18.032 --> 00:59:20.534
I do, but we don't know
if she's down there infected

1125
00:59:20.668 --> 00:59:24.872
or contagious in every minute
that she is breathing our air
or breathing at all.

1126
00:59:25.806 --> 00:59:27.508
She is hurting our chances.

1127
00:59:33.681 --> 00:59:36.517
[whimpering]

1128
00:59:43.090 --> 00:59:44.291
[tense sting]

1129
00:59:48.095 --> 00:59:51.132
My God, just do it. You have to.

1130
00:59:54.802 --> 00:59:56.670
Do you, do you think you can?

1131
01:00:02.576 --> 01:00:05.112
Yes, the three of us
have to survive.

1132
01:00:05.246 --> 01:00:07.782
We don't know how long
until this fog passes.

1133
01:00:12.521 --> 01:00:13.888
I really loved her.

1134
01:00:14.021 --> 01:00:16.090
-And you chose Reegan.
-[angrily] It wasn't...

1135
01:00:16.957 --> 01:00:18.527
-[normally] It wasn't like that.
-What was it like?

1136
01:00:18.659 --> 01:00:21.095
Guys, it doesn't matter.

1137
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:27.034
If nothing else,
she's taking up our good air.

1138
01:00:29.403 --> 01:00:30.304
[inhales sharply]

1139
01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.009
[whispering]
We have to do something.

1140
01:00:35.142 --> 01:00:37.445
Even if he's right,
I won't let him
just execute her.

1141
01:00:37.578 --> 01:00:40.247
[whimpering]

1142
01:00:40.381 --> 01:00:43.918
And us?
How long before Blake decides
we're taking up his good air?

-You fucker!
-I'm telling you.

-[gun cocks]
-You don't have the balls.

1152
01:01:40.741 --> 01:01:42.209
Last chance.

1153
01:01:43.077 --> 01:01:44.745
Hey, fuck you, Blake.

[JK]
Tanner, Tanner, no!

1158
01:01:59.894 --> 01:02:01.929
We're all in this together,
asshole.

01:02:04.665 --> 01:02:07.701
-Tanner!

Oh, what the fuck?

1165
01:02:41.268 --> 01:02:43.337
-[Blake] JK! JK!
-[JK] Blake. Blake?

1166
01:02:44.673 --> 01:02:45.640
Grab the duct tape.

1167
01:02:45.773 --> 01:02:47.241
Cass. Cassie? Baby?

1168
01:02:47.374 --> 01:02:49.410
-Hey, look at me. Look at me.
-Okay.

[wind gusting]

1170
01:03:02.456 --> 01:03:04.858
[Chelsea]
I, I, I don't know
what to do, Tanner.

1171
01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.163
[Tanner]
You guys-- You got--
You gotta stop the bleeding.

1172
01:03:09.296 --> 01:03:11.365
-I know, I know. I'm trying.
-You gotta plug the hole.

1173
01:03:11.498 --> 01:03:12.567
[stutters] No, I can't.

1174
01:03:12.701 --> 01:03:14.268
I can't.
I need to keep pressing.

1175
01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:15.769
[sobbing]

1176
01:03:15.903 --> 01:03:16.904
[Tanner]
Look at me.

1177
01:03:17.438 --> 01:03:19.340
I'm not gonna get any worse
if you do it, okay?

1178
01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:22.644
-You gotta go.
-Okay.

1179
01:03:23.077 --> 01:03:25.212
I need you to duct tape
all the holes in the wall, okay?

1180
01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.147
-Okay? Okay.
-Yeah.

Okay. Holy fuck.

1190
01:04:05.352 --> 01:04:07.821
I fucking told you, Tanner.

1191
01:04:07.955 --> 01:04:10.525
Fucking told you.
I fucking told you.

1192

[sobbing]

1194
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:30.411
Your life is over, Blake.

1195
01:04:30.545 --> 01:04:31.812
He attacked us.

1196
01:04:31.945 --> 01:04:35.416
No, asshole. You started
firing at him and me

1197
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:38.419
in this fucking room
that you trapped us in.

1198
01:04:38.553 --> 01:04:39.820
You're crazy.

1199
01:04:41.155 --> 01:04:44.592
Maybe, Blake.
But you're not. Right?

1200
01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:47.161
Right, that's what
you kept saying.

1201
01:04:47.294 --> 01:04:48.862
You kept saying
that you're fine.

1202
01:04:48.996 --> 01:04:50.998
You know, in fact,
I even heard Cassie

1203
01:04:51.131 --> 01:04:52.933
and Tanner and even JK say that

1204
01:04:53.067 --> 01:04:54.868
they don't feel well,
but not you asshole.

1205
01:04:55.002 --> 01:04:58.540
You just kept saying
that you are of sound mind
and body.

1206
01:04:58.673 --> 01:04:59.607
Fuck you, Chelsea.

1207
01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:01.175
Fuck me? No! Fuck you!

1208
01:05:01.308 --> 01:05:03.110
You're going to jail
forever, Blake.

What can I do?

1213
01:05:10.752 --> 01:05:14.288
I cannot believe how crazy
you're acting, Chelsea.

1214
01:05:15.322 --> 01:05:17.625
Fucking nuts. Fucking nuts.

1215
01:05:19.694 --> 01:05:20.595
I am okay.

1216
01:05:22.262 --> 01:05:24.365
I'm a little cold, but I'm okay.

1217
01:05:25.734 --> 01:05:28.570
Hey. You look okay, yeah?

1218
01:05:28.703 --> 01:05:29.604
You're lying.

1219

No. [sobbing]

1220
01:05:32.439 --> 01:05:33.340
Tell me more.

1221
01:05:38.078 --> 01:05:39.179
Tell me more lies.

1222
01:05:45.152 --> 01:05:47.154
Tell me that
I'll take that ride someday.

1223
01:05:49.957 --> 01:05:51.258
We will, Tanner.

1224
01:05:52.627 --> 01:05:54.662
Just as soon as
we get outta here. Okay?

1225
01:06:04.238 --> 01:06:05.339

We don't know how much fog
is in here.

1228

-What about Georgia?
-What about her?

1229
01:06:27.261 --> 01:06:29.496
-Well, we still have to go ahead
and kill her, don't we?
-No, we don't have to kill her.

1230
01:06:29.631 --> 01:06:32.032
-Why? Because you shot Tanner?
-No, because this fog
is her fault.

1231
01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:33.400
The fog isn't here, bro.

1232
01:06:33.535 --> 01:06:34.669
Yeah, but we don't know how--

1233
01:06:34.803 --> 01:06:36.036
We don't know anything, man.

1234

-What?
-God. Chelsea, how's Tanner?

1238
01:06:48.949 --> 01:06:50.585
He's going to die, JK.

1239
01:06:50.718 --> 01:06:53.287
If you don't help me,
he's going to die.

1240
01:06:54.154 --> 01:06:55.456
-What can we do?
-Nothing.

1241
01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.391
I need you to help me
get him to the car,

1242
01:06:57.525 --> 01:07:00.160
-and then I will get him
somewhere.
-Chelsea, you'll die.

1243
01:07:00.294 --> 01:07:02.831
Cassie, the only place
people are dying

1244
01:07:02.963 --> 01:07:03.798
is in here.

1245
01:07:03.932 --> 01:07:05.567
We can't go out there.

1246
01:07:06.033 --> 01:07:08.368
JK, Tanner is your friend.

1247
01:07:08.503 --> 01:07:11.438
Now help me get him to the car,
please.

1248

It's not gonna happen, Chels.

-Don't.

1254
01:07:24.117 --> 01:07:26.353
What? What, Blake?
You, you just shot him

1255
01:07:26.487 --> 01:07:28.255
and now you're going
to just let him die?

1256
01:07:28.388 --> 01:07:29.858
People will understand.

1257
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:31.693
I don't think that they will.

1258
01:07:31.826 --> 01:07:32.827
Shut up, Chelsea.

1259
01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:34.061
-No.
-[banging continues]

1260
01:07:34.194 --> 01:07:35.229
Stop that.

Or what, Blake?

1262
01:07:36.831 --> 01:07:38.232
Are you gonna murder me too?

1263
01:07:38.365 --> 01:07:39.701
Because that's what you did
to Tanner.

1264

-If he dies, you are a murderer.

You'll let the fog in.

just "please, don't let
the scary fog in." Fuck.

She's going crazy now too.
