00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.265
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah, hey!

3
00:05:30.332 --> 00:05:33.101
I'm sorry to bother you.
I know you're busy all the time.

4
00:05:33.168 --> 00:05:35.136
Oh, I mean, it's not a bother.

5
00:05:35.203 --> 00:05:37.305
Listen, I was packin'
up all that stuff

6
00:05:37.372 --> 00:05:41.910
and I packed up all Mom's stuff
in the boxes and, uh...

7
00:05:41.977 --> 00:05:44.412
All the painting stuff
went with it, you know.

8
00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.014
Do you want it?

9
00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:47.582
I don't paint, Dad.

10
00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:48.816
You really should
paint, you know.

11
00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:50.151
You got plenty of talent.

12
00:05:50.218 --> 00:05:51.819
I can't.
It just...

13
00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:53.821
It reminds me of her, okay?

14
00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:55.323
I mean, I understand that.

15
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.392
But if you ever do wanna
paint, you let me know

16
00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:00.028
because I think she'd like
you to have her stuff.

17
00:06:00.095 --> 00:06:01.429
I'll think about it.

18
00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:03.932
What is it you're
doing now, anyway?

19
00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.034
I'm about to go paddle out
and shoot some.

20
00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:08.703
Who's going out there
with you, anyway?

21
00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:09.870
Jason.

22
00:06:09.938 --> 00:06:11.839
Just you and Jason, huh?

23
00:06:11.906 --> 00:06:13.642
Actually, there's
a makeup artist with us.

24
00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.210
Her name's Meghan.

25
00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:16.478
Jason said they're
pretty good friends.

26
00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:19.948
Okay, nice and professional, eh?

27
00:06:20.015 --> 00:06:23.151
Where exactly are you gonna
go to take these photos?

28
00:06:23.218 --> 00:06:25.120
Just that same little spot.

29
00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:26.588
All right. Well, you
gotta make sure

30
00:06:26.655 --> 00:06:28.023
you're checkin'
the weather, right?

31
00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:29.524
Yeah, it's good.

32
00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:32.860
I mean, we've been there
hundreds of times, so...

33
00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:35.063
Listen, I know you're
a water baby, but,

34
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.300
you know, it is the ocean.
Let's face it.

35
00:06:38.366 --> 00:06:40.969
It's a bay, Dad, and
if the weather gets bad,

36
00:06:41.036 --> 00:06:42.570
then we'll just turn
around and come back.

37
00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:45.273
It'll be fine, all right?

38
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.975
But I gotta go.
We're about to load up.

39
00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:49.444
All right.
Well, be careful.

40
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:51.446
Thanks.

41
00:06:51.513 --> 00:06:53.281
Listen, have fun, okay?

42
00:06:53.348 --> 00:06:55.350
Please remember I love you
and I miss you.

43
00:06:55.417 --> 00:06:56.584
Love you, too.

44
00:07:55.243 --> 00:07:57.679
Oh, this reminds me
when I was 12.

45
00:07:57.746 --> 00:07:58.879
You ate this when you were 12?

46
00:07:58.947 --> 00:08:00.048
You didn't?

47
00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:01.516
No. I had Slim Jims.

48
00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:03.618
Tried to find Slim Jims.
This is all they had.

49
00:08:03.685 --> 00:08:05.820
You know what's
in Slim Jims, right?

50
00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:07.455
No, not really.

51
00:08:07.522 --> 00:08:09.958
Have you ever heard
of Soylent Green?

52
00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:12.127
Yeah. Like the drink.

53
00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:14.295
You're losing points here!

54
00:08:14.362 --> 00:08:16.965
The 1973 classic
with Charlton Heston.

55
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:18.767
Soylent Green is people!

56
00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:22.170
People? Okay.
That's why it tastes so good.

57
00:08:22.237 --> 00:08:23.204
You're gross.

58
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:24.706
You're grosser.

59
00:08:24.773 --> 00:08:25.940
Ugh.

60
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:29.878
Sarah!
Meet Meghan.

61
00:08:29.944 --> 00:08:31.579
Meghan, meet Sarah.

62
00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:35.483
Thanks for the introduction.
We actually met once before.

63
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.186
Our last photo exhibit,
you said something like

64
00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:40.155
our photos
look like paintings.

65
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:43.892
Oh, yeah!
Painting with light!

66
00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.560
Wow, you have a great memory.

67
00:08:45.627 --> 00:08:47.128
Wouldn't forget it.

68
00:08:47.195 --> 00:08:49.497
Great. I didn't know you guys
had met before.

69
00:08:49.564 --> 00:08:51.499
There was a lot
of people at that show.

70
00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:54.102
Well, Meghan showed
me her portfolio.

71
00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:56.171
And her makeup work is awesome.

72
00:08:56.237 --> 00:08:58.440
Yeah. I actually checked
it out online.

73
00:08:58.506 --> 00:09:00.208
Nice work.

74
00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:01.876
Great. All right.
We're all awesome then.

75
00:09:01.943 --> 00:09:03.344
Yeah!

76
00:09:03.411 --> 00:09:05.013
Hey, listen, guys,
I know we planned on going

77
00:09:05.079 --> 00:09:07.649
back to that island
just past Cudjoe Basin.

78
00:09:09.184 --> 00:09:11.553
But I wanted to pitch
another option.

79
00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:12.720
You know that hurricane
that tore through

80
00:09:12.787 --> 00:09:13.988
the Keys last month?

81
00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:15.056
Well, it rearranged
all the channels

82
00:09:15.123 --> 00:09:17.091
leading into Florida Bay.

83
00:09:17.158 --> 00:09:18.960
I've been speaking to
some fishing buddies.

84
00:09:19.027 --> 00:09:20.662
They told me that a
submerged rock formation

85
00:09:20.728 --> 00:09:24.666
is now above water in the
channel, in the outer banks.

86
00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:28.203
I promise you the shots
will be sick.

87
00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:30.805
We'd be the first to capture it.

88
00:09:30.872 --> 00:09:33.107
They say it looks
like the Bahamas.

89
00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:34.742
It's just a little further out.

90
00:09:34.809 --> 00:09:36.110
But if we leave now,

91
00:09:36.177 --> 00:09:37.812
we can be there
and back by nightfall.

92
00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.547
How much further out?

93
00:09:39.614 --> 00:09:42.484
Well, it's just past Cuba,
so I guess that should be...

94
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.451
Shut up!

95
00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:44.986
No. I mean, where we're headed,

96
00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:47.655
I would say maybe another
hour beyond that.

97
00:09:47.722 --> 00:09:48.857
So three hours?

98
00:09:48.924 --> 00:09:50.592
Yeah.

99
00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:52.861
How do you know if
it's still above water?

100
00:09:52.928 --> 00:09:54.662
Well, my buddies
were there two days ago.

101
00:09:54.729 --> 00:09:57.398
It's mostly underwater,
but with these peak tides

102
00:09:57.465 --> 00:09:59.567
we're having,
should be high and dry

103
00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:02.770
for at least two or
three hours during low tide.

104
00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:04.572
Wouldn't it be awesome
to be the first

105
00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:07.041
to capture an entirely
new island?

106
00:10:08.978 --> 00:10:10.812
I'm in.

107
00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.647
Yeah? Good.

108
00:10:12.714 --> 00:10:13.781
Me too.

109
00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:16.117
Great! Great!
Okay!

110
00:10:16.184 --> 00:10:17.819
Hey! Phone!
Want it in the dry bag?

111
00:10:17.886 --> 00:10:20.788
I'm probably just gonna
hang on to it, but thank you.

112
00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:25.460
Well, these are the things
that cannot get wet.

113
00:10:25.527 --> 00:10:28.563
I thought you said your
makeup was waterproof.

114
00:10:29.864 --> 00:10:31.599
Well, it is, but my kit's not.

115
00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:34.102
Okay. All right, guys,
let's hit the water.

116
00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:36.237
We gotta make our window.
Let's go.

117
00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:06.001
Ladies...

118
00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:07.235
I call blue!

119
00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:09.404
Oh, you got
the pretty one.

120
00:11:15.076 --> 00:11:16.511
I got you.

121
00:11:17.445 --> 00:11:20.682
Nice, all right.
Take your time.

122
00:11:20.748 --> 00:11:22.684
Good?

123
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.253
Nice. Balance.

124
00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:29.357
Okay.

125
00:11:34.696 --> 00:11:36.364
We're good to go!

126
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.811
All right, ladies.

127
00:12:56.878 --> 00:12:59.681
Tide cycles are at peak
highs and peak lows.

128
00:12:59.747 --> 00:13:02.483
We gotta get in,
get what we need, get out,

129
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.585
before it goes back underwater.

130
00:13:04.652 --> 00:13:07.522
Fortunately, with a
photographer like myself

131
00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:11.426
and a stellar
makeup artist like you,

132
00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:13.628
a couple of hours will
be more than enough.

133
00:13:15.196 --> 00:13:16.798
Forgetting someone?

134
00:13:16.864 --> 00:13:20.368
Oh, yeah, our subject.

135
00:13:20.435 --> 00:13:22.137
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:13:22.203 --> 00:13:24.605
She's all right, but you know,
with all that natural beauty

137
00:13:24.672 --> 00:13:27.809
in the environment,
the model doesn't matter much.

138
00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:31.947
You're gonna shoot me
in silhouette, right?

139
00:13:32.014 --> 00:13:33.681
Silhouette? Yeah.

140
00:13:33.748 --> 00:13:35.283
Actually, the whole thing's
not gonna even be in focus.

141
00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:36.985
That sounds about right.

142
00:13:37.052 --> 00:13:38.087
Ouch!

143
00:13:39.687 --> 00:13:41.355
Guess you don't need
a makeup artist anyway.

144
00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:43.992
Oh, no, no.
We definitely need you.

145
00:13:44.059 --> 00:13:47.295
Even in silhouette, she's gonna
need as much makeup as possible.

146
00:13:48.763 --> 00:13:50.398
Okay...

147
00:13:50.465 --> 00:13:52.467
Okay, okay, all right!

148
00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:54.368
All right!
Enough fun.

149
00:13:54.435 --> 00:13:55.703
Jeez, we gotta get there!

150
00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.839
Keep paddling, ladies,
keep paddling.

151
00:13:57.906 --> 00:13:59.440
Beep, beep.

152
00:14:36.078 --> 00:14:37.212
Hey, Sarah.

153
00:14:37.278 --> 00:14:39.081
I saw you on your phone earlier.

154
00:14:39.148 --> 00:14:41.449
- Was that your dad?
- Yeah.

155
00:14:41.516 --> 00:14:42.650
How's he doin'?

156
00:14:44.285 --> 00:14:45.553
Okay, I guess.

157
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.989
Definitely not
used to being alone.

158
00:14:48.489 --> 00:14:50.892
Yeah.
Yeah, I get it.

159
00:14:53.628 --> 00:14:55.931
My mom passed away about
a year ago.

160
00:14:55.998 --> 00:14:58.399
But we knew it was coming,
so we were prepared.

161
00:15:00.802 --> 00:15:02.503
I mean, as well
as anyone can be.

162
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.742
I'm so sorry.

163
00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:09.410
Thanks.

164
00:15:09.477 --> 00:15:11.947
It's not easy.
She was...

165
00:15:12.014 --> 00:15:15.850
She was one of a kind,
just like her daughter.

166
00:15:15.918 --> 00:15:16.919
An artist, right?

167
00:15:18.886 --> 00:15:21.622
Her dad is a bush pilot,
flew all over the world,

168
00:15:21.689 --> 00:15:24.092
was delivering medicine
in Botswana.

169
00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:25.393
He was in the Air Force.

170
00:15:25.459 --> 00:15:27.930
Not the Air Force.

171
00:15:27.996 --> 00:15:29.932
What was it then?

172
00:15:29.998 --> 00:15:31.300
Civil Air Patrol.

173
00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:32.901
Yeah, that's part
of the Air Force.

174
00:15:32.968 --> 00:15:36.337
No, it's different.
They're volunteers.

175
00:15:36.404 --> 00:15:38.706
Right, volunteer.
So he's a super hero.

176
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.844
Did he ask about me?

177
00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:43.946
Actually, he did.

178
00:15:45.113 --> 00:15:46.848
Yes! See?
Super hero.

179
00:16:40.969 --> 00:16:42.070
Whoa!

180
00:16:42.137 --> 00:16:43.404
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

181
00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:50.045
Those are dolphins!

182
00:16:50.112 --> 00:16:51.445
Check it out.

183
00:16:56.084 --> 00:16:57.986
Wow!

184
00:16:58.053 --> 00:17:00.888
I've never been this close
to dolphins before.

185
00:17:13.268 --> 00:17:14.502
Whoa!

186
00:17:14.568 --> 00:17:15.703
Dude, look at that!

187
00:17:16.737 --> 00:17:18.639
That dolphin is really beat up.

188
00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:23.444
What do you think did that?

189
00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:24.913
Maybe a boat?

190
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.747
No, no, no.
These are bottlenose.

191
00:17:26.814 --> 00:17:28.984
I mean, they're
the bad boys of the ocean.

192
00:17:31.585 --> 00:17:33.121
Who knows who
they're hustling with.

193
00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:36.891
It looks like bite marks.

194
00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:37.926
Yeah.

195
00:18:05.988 --> 00:18:09.091
We're making good time, ladies.
Let's take five.

196
00:18:09.157 --> 00:18:10.092
Please...

197
00:18:12.327 --> 00:18:15.130
How much further, you think?

198
00:18:15.197 --> 00:18:17.232
Say around two hours.

199
00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:19.633
See, this is the time
I think I would have loved

200
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.502
to pitch in to a motorboat.

201
00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:25.073
Okay, planet killer, right?

202
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.076
Look, I mean, this can be
pretty dodgy around here,

203
00:18:28.143 --> 00:18:29.777
especially if you don't
know the area.

204
00:18:29.844 --> 00:18:32.080
I mean, you got reefs,
oysters bars.

205
00:18:32.147 --> 00:18:33.448
You gotta be careful.

206
00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:35.183
Yeah. Honestly, even
the Coast Guard takes it easy

207
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.918
in the back water.

208
00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:39.787
Didn't you say you were a
monster with a paddle?

209
00:18:41.722 --> 00:18:44.960
Yeah... not this kind
of paddle.

210
00:18:46.028 --> 00:18:48.596
Okay.

211
00:18:48.662 --> 00:18:50.664
What? Live a little.

212
00:19:19.327 --> 00:19:20.996
So this is our usual spot,

213
00:19:21.063 --> 00:19:22.797
but the rock formation we're
gonna be shooting at today

214
00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:26.634
is just a little bit further
south towards the reef.

215
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.170
Gonna be worth that extra mile.

216
00:19:28.236 --> 00:19:32.174
Um, will you put this
in your dry bag, please?

217
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.342
Certainly.

218
00:19:34.409 --> 00:19:36.677
Glad to see you've come around.

219
00:19:36.744 --> 00:19:38.213
Behave.

220
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.948
What?

221
00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:45.853
All right, guys.

222
00:19:47.655 --> 00:19:48.789
Almost there.

223
00:19:54.728 --> 00:19:56.998
And here we are!

224
00:19:57.065 --> 00:20:00.368
Look at this place!
Doesn't this look great?

225
00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:01.735
I don't know.

226
00:20:01.802 --> 00:20:03.572
Looks like a cement block
with barnacles.

227
00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:06.607
We're not goin' for pretty.
We're going for unique.

228
00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:08.076
The shots are gonna be awesome.

229
00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:02.264
Woo!

230
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.697
Whoa.

231
00:21:04.566 --> 00:21:06.434
Wow.

232
00:21:06.501 --> 00:21:07.435
All right!

233
00:21:09.803 --> 00:21:11.039
What do we think?

234
00:21:11.106 --> 00:21:12.107
Wow!

235
00:21:12.174 --> 00:21:13.942
It's definitely not the Bahamas,

236
00:21:14.009 --> 00:21:16.144
but I feel we can probably
make it work.

237
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:18.246
Okay? Right.
That's what we wanna hear!

238
00:21:18.313 --> 00:21:19.680
All right, let's get this
show on the road!

239
00:21:19.747 --> 00:21:21.116
Yeah.

240
00:21:21.183 --> 00:21:24.019
Let me get the camera.
You guys do makeup.

241
00:21:24.085 --> 00:21:26.288
- Will you get my wrap?
- Yeah.

242
00:21:26.354 --> 00:21:27.455
Sit right there?

243
00:21:27.522 --> 00:21:29.057
Yeah, perfect.

244
00:21:29.124 --> 00:21:30.791
Okay.

245
00:21:32.994 --> 00:21:35.363
What are you thinking?

246
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.898
I'm thinking let's keep
with the natural look.

247
00:21:37.966 --> 00:21:39.234
- I like it.
- Okay.

248
00:21:39.301 --> 00:21:41.069
You have a natural
beauty about you.

249
00:21:41.136 --> 00:21:42.037
Thank you.

250
00:21:42.103 --> 00:21:43.171
- Yeah, you, too.
- Thank you!

251
00:21:43.238 --> 00:21:45.340
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's see.

252
00:21:45.407 --> 00:21:48.476
Do you want to fry it
or do you wanna...

253
00:21:48.543 --> 00:21:49.978
I like it a little wet.

254
00:21:58.119 --> 00:21:59.820
Perfect!

255
00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:04.259
What do you think?

256
00:22:04.326 --> 00:22:06.027
Yeah, it's nice.

257
00:22:06.094 --> 00:22:08.530
Damn, a beautiful mermaid!

258
00:22:08.597 --> 00:22:10.198
I'm serious!

259
00:22:10.265 --> 00:22:12.200
And then with the wrap
on your waist, it'll be perfect.

260
00:22:12.267 --> 00:22:13.969
Yeah, I dig it.

261
00:22:14.035 --> 00:22:16.905
All right, let's do some shoots.

262
00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:19.840
All right, nice!

263
00:22:23.712 --> 00:22:25.580
Yeah, that's it.

264
00:22:25.647 --> 00:22:27.048
Get that light.

265
00:22:30.151 --> 00:22:31.819
Nice, let's do it. Can you
turn a little bit that way?

266
00:22:31.885 --> 00:22:33.421
Yeah, that's it.

267
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.528
Ha-ha.

268
00:22:40.595 --> 00:22:41.529
All right, hold on a sec!

269
00:22:44.566 --> 00:22:47.868
I wasn't expecting you
to invite me out here.

270
00:22:47.936 --> 00:22:49.571
Well, why not?

271
00:22:49.638 --> 00:22:51.306
You're awesome.

272
00:22:51.373 --> 00:22:53.275
Thank you.

273
00:22:53.341 --> 00:22:56.478
I know, it's just the whole...
Sarah thing.

274
00:22:56.544 --> 00:23:00.881
No, look. Sarah and
I are friends, good friends.

275
00:23:02.584 --> 00:23:04.586
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

276
00:23:04.653 --> 00:23:05.819
It's not like that.

277
00:23:08.423 --> 00:23:10.191
I just don't want to get
in between anything...

278
00:23:10.258 --> 00:23:12.227
There's nothing there,
not anymore.

279
00:23:12.294 --> 00:23:16.830
Look, Sarah and I, we were
together for a while.

280
00:23:16.897 --> 00:23:22.070
And it was special, but it's not
special in the way you think.

281
00:23:24.739 --> 00:23:27.875
I care about Sarah and her
family means the world to me.

282
00:23:27.942 --> 00:23:30.912
I admire her... and her dad.

283
00:23:30.979 --> 00:23:35.317
I was with them when
her mom had her illness.

284
00:23:35.383 --> 00:23:37.885
You know, it almost
broke their family.

285
00:23:37.952 --> 00:23:41.589
I'm really happy
that you came, okay?

286
00:23:41.656 --> 00:23:44.259
Yeah, I'm so happy to be here.
I just want...

287
00:23:44.326 --> 00:23:46.094
I just want to make sure
you can do what you want

288
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:47.162
and you're cool with it.

289
00:23:47.228 --> 00:23:48.896
You know what I wanna do?

290
00:23:48.963 --> 00:23:50.231
I would love for
us three to make

291
00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:51.899
some really cool art together.

292
00:23:53.501 --> 00:23:55.003
Me, too.

293
00:24:00.008 --> 00:24:02.911
I actually have that
same one at home.

294
00:24:02.977 --> 00:24:04.512
No kidding? Right?

295
00:24:09.384 --> 00:24:12.354
Check this one out.
The lighting is so dope!

296
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.724
You wanna get down a little bit?
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

297
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.259
I'll grab the GoPro.
Do you mind holding this?

298
00:24:18.326 --> 00:24:19.928
- I don't mind at all.
- Thank you.

299
00:24:21.996 --> 00:24:24.032
Okay.

300
00:24:24.099 --> 00:24:26.901
You're right, yeah.
That's gonna be good!

301
00:24:30.705 --> 00:24:32.073
Looking good!

302
00:24:36.544 --> 00:24:38.113
She's nice.

303
00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:40.749
Meghan? Yeah, she's cool.

304
00:24:40.815 --> 00:24:43.618
I, uh, I don't know much
about her makeup credentials.

305
00:24:43.685 --> 00:24:44.986
But I can definitely see

306
00:24:45.053 --> 00:24:46.721
why you'd want
to bring her along.

307
00:24:46.788 --> 00:24:48.523
You guys seem like you're
getting along real well.

308
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:49.791
Yeah, she's cool.

309
00:24:49.858 --> 00:24:51.960
We hung out after
the last gallery.

310
00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:53.762
You left early.

311
00:24:53.828 --> 00:24:58.066
Yeah, I honestly think she'd be
a really good pick for you.

312
00:24:58.133 --> 00:25:00.034
We're, uh, we're
doin' matchmaker now?

313
00:25:00.101 --> 00:25:01.703
That's an interesting switch.

314
00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.738
No, I'm not playing matchmaker.

315
00:25:03.805 --> 00:25:05.006
I'm just making an observation.

316
00:25:05.073 --> 00:25:06.508
An observation, okay.

317
00:25:06.574 --> 00:25:09.778
Well, what do you see now?
What do you observe?

318
00:25:09.844 --> 00:25:14.082
I observe that we should
probably just keep shooting.

319
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:17.285
Sarah?

320
00:25:17.352 --> 00:25:18.653
What?

321
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.455
All I'm saying is that...

322
00:25:20.522 --> 00:25:24.626
if you ever did decide to move
on, I would be happy for you.

323
00:25:24.692 --> 00:25:26.094
Yeah.

324
00:25:27.595 --> 00:25:29.831
All right. Are we good?

325
00:25:29.898 --> 00:25:32.200
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

326
00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:34.736
- Underwater shots?
- Yeah, sure.

327
00:25:34.803 --> 00:25:36.404
Go for it.

328
00:25:40.542 --> 00:25:41.543
Me first?

329
00:25:43.778 --> 00:25:45.213
Woo!

330
00:25:53.855 --> 00:25:55.089
All right, I got you!

331
00:25:58.928 --> 00:26:00.562
Ready?

332
00:26:00.628 --> 00:26:01.563
- Woo!
- Woo!

333
00:26:19.714 --> 00:26:21.049
Jason.

334
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:25.921
Go back up, all right?

335
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.423
Okay, wait 'til I get
low and swim down to me, yeah?

336
00:27:04.025 --> 00:27:05.159
Oh, my God.

337
00:27:07.161 --> 00:27:08.296
Shark!

338
00:27:11.699 --> 00:27:14.202
Sarah! Jason!

339
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:16.738
Get out of the water!
There's a shark!

340
00:27:16.804 --> 00:27:18.406
There's a shark!

341
00:27:20.708 --> 00:27:26.814
- Jason!
- Sarah, get to shore!

342
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.727
Ah!

343
00:27:40.996 --> 00:27:42.430
Jason!

344
00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:46.234
Jason!

345
00:27:54.043 --> 00:27:55.710
Jason!

346
00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:21.669
What are we gonna do?

347
00:28:21.736 --> 00:28:23.605
It's right there!
I don't know!

348
00:28:47.128 --> 00:28:49.297
What do we do?
What do we do?

349
00:28:49.364 --> 00:28:50.832
What do we do?
What do we do?

350
00:28:50.898 --> 00:28:53.668
What do we do?
I've never been through this!

351
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.438
My phone, my phone,
my phone, my phone.

352
00:28:59.908 --> 00:29:01.776
My phone's in here.

353
00:29:01.843 --> 00:29:02.844
Just, uh...

354
00:29:06.314 --> 00:29:08.616
My phone's dead.
My phone's dead!

355
00:29:08.683 --> 00:29:11.853
Just get your phone!
Is it working?

356
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.187
No signal!

357
00:29:13.254 --> 00:29:14.589
Go find a signal
and call 911, please.

358
00:29:14.656 --> 00:29:15.924
Just call 911.

359
00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:17.759
I'm not calling 911.
I'm calling my dad.

360
00:29:17.825 --> 00:29:19.827
No, no, no, no!

361
00:29:19.894 --> 00:29:21.396
Please just call 911!

362
00:29:21.462 --> 00:29:23.231
My battery is almost dead,
all right?

363
00:29:23.297 --> 00:29:24.799
I only have time
to make one call.

364
00:29:24.866 --> 00:29:27.069
Why would your dad be
the one to call?

365
00:29:27.136 --> 00:29:28.770
He will figure it out!

366
00:29:28.836 --> 00:29:31.140
If there's anybody that
can do this, it's him!

367
00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:35.410
But my battery is dying and I
still don't have a signal, okay?

368
00:29:35.476 --> 00:29:37.478
Your dad doesn't
know we're here!

369
00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:39.948
We changed our plans, remember?

370
00:29:40.015 --> 00:29:43.018
He will figure it out, okay?

371
00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:45.620
I need you to trust me!

372
00:29:45.687 --> 00:29:47.321
You're supposed to call 911.

373
00:29:47.388 --> 00:29:48.756
You're not supposed
to call your daddy.

374
00:29:48.823 --> 00:29:52.593
Okay, we call 911,
911 calls the Coast Guard.

375
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.130
They call the Navy and
they call Civil Air Patrol!

376
00:29:55.196 --> 00:29:57.532
Either way, it ends up on
his desk for Search and Rescue!

377
00:29:57.598 --> 00:29:59.902
So I need you to trust me.

378
00:29:59.968 --> 00:30:03.337
Because I just got a signal
and I'm calling my dad!

379
00:30:05.339 --> 00:30:07.542
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

380
00:30:17.052 --> 00:30:18.886
Oh, God.

381
00:30:22.024 --> 00:30:23.224
Yes, hello?

382
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:24.392
Dad, dad, dad, listen!
It's me!

383
00:30:24.459 --> 00:30:26.128
Dad, I don't have a lot of time,

384
00:30:26.195 --> 00:30:29.198
but we're stranded where
we're on this rock formation.

385
00:30:29.263 --> 00:30:31.866
And we didn't go to the island
that we normally go to.

386
00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:35.904
We're like an hour
off of Cudjoe Key!

387
00:30:35.971 --> 00:30:37.371
Dad, Jason died.

388
00:30:37.438 --> 00:30:38.907
It was a shark.

389
00:30:38.974 --> 00:30:40.475
Wait a second!

390
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.111
Jason's dead?

391
00:30:42.177 --> 00:30:43.644
Yes!

392
00:30:43.711 --> 00:30:45.880
This thing is circling
and the tide's coming in.

393
00:30:45.948 --> 00:30:47.715
We're not safe here.

394
00:30:47.782 --> 00:30:48.850
Are you okay?

395
00:30:48.917 --> 00:30:50.618
We're here!
We're on land!

396
00:30:50.685 --> 00:30:52.487
Dad, the tide's rising a
lot faster than I thought!

397
00:30:52.553 --> 00:30:55.389
I think we have
like 45 minutes.

398
00:30:55.456 --> 00:30:57.291
I have that long and
this phone's gonna die!

399
00:30:57.358 --> 00:30:59.761
I just need you to tell me
that you're gonna find us!

400
00:30:59.827 --> 00:31:01.496
Honey, listen.
You're doin' good.

401
00:31:01.562 --> 00:31:03.464
I'll get on with
Civil Air Patrol.

402
00:31:03.531 --> 00:31:07.368
Telephone Forensics Team
can get a bead on your location.

403
00:31:07.435 --> 00:31:10.671
Stay where you are
as long as you can.

404
00:31:10.738 --> 00:31:13.574
Yeah, we'll stay here, but,
Dad, the water's rising.

405
00:31:13.641 --> 00:31:15.944
The tide's coming in so much
faster than we thought.

406
00:31:16.011 --> 00:31:18.613
Okay, and are there
any other islands around?

407
00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:19.847
Is there anyplace else
you can go?

408
00:31:19.915 --> 00:31:22.450
Yes! I saw one on
the way in here.

409
00:31:22.517 --> 00:31:23.919
I don't know where it is,
but I can find it.

410
00:31:23.986 --> 00:31:26.989
Listen, just stay there
as long as you can.

411
00:31:31.126 --> 00:31:33.427
It's coming... It's coming back!
The shark!

412
00:31:33.494 --> 00:31:34.562
What was that?
Are you okay?

413
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:36.098
We're fine, we're fine!

414
00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:40.135
Just please promise me
you'll find us, okay?

415
00:31:42.971 --> 00:31:44.907
Honey! Honey!

416
00:31:44.973 --> 00:31:46.440
Dad!

417
00:32:11.266 --> 00:32:12.800
It's something.

418
00:32:27.316 --> 00:32:28.984
Listen, yes, I've tried.

419
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:31.452
I tried to get her back, but
it goes straight to voicemail.

420
00:32:33.754 --> 00:32:36.691
Do you have enough data
to pinpoint her location?

421
00:32:36.757 --> 00:32:40.028
Cellphone forensics is
analyzing the pings

422
00:32:40.095 --> 00:32:43.165
from their phones provided
by the cellphone carrier.

423
00:32:43.232 --> 00:32:47.768
As you were saying, it appears
the phones are off now.

424
00:32:47.835 --> 00:32:49.804
With the limited data
we do have,

425
00:32:49.871 --> 00:32:51.974
I can't get exact
GPS coordinates.

426
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.276
But by tracking
the direction of the pings

427
00:32:54.343 --> 00:32:55.911
when the phones were on,

428
00:32:55.978 --> 00:32:58.146
it appears you're right
from what you were saying.

429
00:32:58.213 --> 00:33:00.015
It seems to be they're
traveling towards

430
00:33:00.082 --> 00:33:02.383
the outer islands
of the Florida Bay,

431
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.019
the Cudjoe Basin.

432
00:33:04.086 --> 00:33:06.554
Right. So it looks like
they were heading

433
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:08.991
to those outer islands that
I was telling you about.

434
00:33:09.057 --> 00:33:12.693
All the initial pings line up
heading to those islands,

435
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.729
except the last one
which was a little off,

436
00:33:14.795 --> 00:33:16.198
which could be an anomaly.

437
00:33:16.265 --> 00:33:17.732
With only one local tower,

438
00:33:17.798 --> 00:33:20.035
it's hard to get an
exact GPS location.

439
00:33:20.102 --> 00:33:24.805
How confident are you of the
accuracy of the cellphone data?

440
00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:27.309
Unfortunately, the cellphone
forensics team

441
00:33:27.376 --> 00:33:30.178
won't be able to pinpoint
their exact location.

442
00:33:30.245 --> 00:33:32.813
With only one local
tower in that area,

443
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.682
it's more of a wilderness area.

444
00:33:34.749 --> 00:33:36.684
If there were
three local towers,

445
00:33:36.751 --> 00:33:38.987
we would be able to
triangulate their location.

446
00:33:39.054 --> 00:33:41.522
We are basing it on
what we have

447
00:33:41.589 --> 00:33:43.959
and what you told us
about their destination.

448
00:33:44.026 --> 00:33:45.260
Okay, got it.

449
00:33:45.327 --> 00:33:47.528
The other issue is because
of the single tower,

450
00:33:47.595 --> 00:33:48.997
reception becomes an issue.

451
00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:51.899
There's no full coverage
in that basin.

452
00:33:51.967 --> 00:33:54.869
If they venture in
an area without reception,

453
00:33:54.937 --> 00:33:57.838
even our limited tracking
is impossible.

454
00:33:57.906 --> 00:34:01.676
What is the ETA on getting
a decision on who's available?

455
00:34:01.742 --> 00:34:04.212
I'll have an answer
by 0300 hours.

456
00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:06.747
It's got to be faster than that!

457
00:34:06.814 --> 00:34:09.418
That area is affected
by tidal flow.

458
00:34:09.483 --> 00:34:11.852
I hear what you're saying.
We'll have an answer pronto.

459
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.889
And I will get eyes in
the sky as soon as possible.

460
00:34:14.957 --> 00:34:16.524
Okay.

461
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.026
Then I'll call her back soon.

462
00:34:18.093 --> 00:34:20.929
Now let me know if
the cellphone forensics team

463
00:34:20.996 --> 00:34:25.100
can get a better idea
on their location, okay? Thanks.

464
00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:27.568
We'll do our best to
find her, James.

465
00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:29.670
I'll be in touch.

466
00:34:39.314 --> 00:34:40.748
Hey, it's Sarah.

467
00:34:40.815 --> 00:34:42.750
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

468
00:34:43.986 --> 00:34:46.721
Honey, I guess
you're phone is off.

469
00:34:46.787 --> 00:34:50.359
I got you through
Civil Air Patrol.

470
00:34:50.425 --> 00:34:53.161
We're working on trying to
get a lock on your location.

471
00:34:53.228 --> 00:34:55.796
It won't be exact,
but close enough

472
00:34:55.863 --> 00:34:57.432
to narrow down the search.

473
00:34:57.498 --> 00:35:01.303
They're gonna send up
a spotter plane within one hour.

474
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.670
I hope you're all right.

475
00:35:02.737 --> 00:35:05.207
Don't worry.
Help is on the way.

476
00:35:05.273 --> 00:35:06.475
So call me.

477
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.842
I love you.

478
00:35:15.816 --> 00:35:18.420
Tides are coming in fast again.

479
00:35:18.487 --> 00:35:19.653
I noticed.

480
00:35:27.862 --> 00:35:29.597
What are we gonna do?

481
00:35:31.199 --> 00:35:32.934
Look for higher ground.

482
00:35:33.001 --> 00:35:34.769
I'm not getting back
in that water.

483
00:35:34.835 --> 00:35:36.271
I'm not.
I'm not doing it.

484
00:35:36.338 --> 00:35:39.874
Look, where we stand,
will soon be underwater

485
00:35:39.941 --> 00:35:42.077
and we won't have a choice.

486
00:35:42.144 --> 00:35:45.947
Maybe we just stay here,
someone will find us!

487
00:35:46.014 --> 00:35:48.350
And we won't have to get back
in the water with the shark.

488
00:35:48.417 --> 00:35:50.986
That'd be great, but we
can't argue with the reality

489
00:35:51.053 --> 00:35:52.787
of the situation
we're in right now,

490
00:35:52.853 --> 00:35:56.824
which is that this island
is going under fast.

491
00:35:56.891 --> 00:35:59.693
So we do need to act
and we need to act now.

492
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:13.275
Sarah, the kayaks!

493
00:36:13.341 --> 00:36:14.443
Shit!

494
00:36:14.509 --> 00:36:15.743
What?

495
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.711
- Come on!
- Oh, come on!

496
00:37:05.594 --> 00:37:08.497
It's right there, it's right
there, it's right there!

497
00:37:08.563 --> 00:37:12.766
Meghan, put your paddle
in the water and let's go!

498
00:37:12.833 --> 00:37:14.903
Okay, okay, okay!

499
00:37:40.061 --> 00:37:42.063
Come on, Meg.
I need you to keep the pace up!

500
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.532
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

501
00:37:43.598 --> 00:37:45.100
Right there.

502
00:37:45.167 --> 00:37:47.269
Dry land, it's right there.

503
00:37:51.273 --> 00:37:52.673
Meghan, are you with me?

504
00:37:56.378 --> 00:37:57.579
Oh, God.
It's back

505
00:37:57.646 --> 00:37:59.447
- It's back.
- Where?

506
00:37:59.514 --> 00:38:01.149
It's right there.

507
00:38:06.555 --> 00:38:08.390
Let's go!

508
00:38:24.439 --> 00:38:25.607
What is that?

509
00:38:25.674 --> 00:38:27.175
Oh my God, it's sharks.

510
00:38:27.242 --> 00:38:29.010
It's sharks, it's sharks,
it's sharks!

511
00:38:30.679 --> 00:38:33.048
Come on!
Come on!

512
00:38:33.114 --> 00:38:34.216
Move!

513
00:38:41.855 --> 00:38:43.358
Dolphins.

514
00:39:04.512 --> 00:39:06.648
Come on! This is our window!
Let's go!

515
00:39:06.715 --> 00:39:07.949
Okay!

516
00:39:11.486 --> 00:39:12.954
Meghan, let's go!

517
00:39:13.021 --> 00:39:14.855
Where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we go?

518
00:39:14.923 --> 00:39:16.091
Right in front of us!

519
00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:18.093
I don't know!

520
00:39:18.159 --> 00:39:20.095
Meghan, don't stop!

521
00:39:20.161 --> 00:39:21.895
It's coming this way.

522
00:39:26.635 --> 00:39:29.037
Come on. You got this.
Keep up with me, Meg!

523
00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:33.275
That's the land right there.
We can make it.

524
00:39:36.911 --> 00:39:39.547
I gotta take a break,
I gotta take a break.

525
00:39:41.082 --> 00:39:42.617
We gotta keep goin'!

526
00:39:42.684 --> 00:39:44.019
Please, I just need a minute.

527
00:39:44.085 --> 00:39:45.453
Sarah, please, just one minute.

528
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:55.930
I didn't sign up
for this survival B.S.

529
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.536
Neither did I.

530
00:40:01.603 --> 00:40:03.071
Why couldn't he
have done this shoot

531
00:40:03.138 --> 00:40:07.142
on like a beach with
big palm trees?

532
00:40:08.643 --> 00:40:11.812
You know, originally, we talked
about doing this in a pool.

533
00:40:12.846 --> 00:40:14.582
Are you kidding me?

534
00:40:14.649 --> 00:40:16.151
What happened?

535
00:40:18.353 --> 00:40:21.923
You know Jason.
He always had to push the limit.

536
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:26.728
Well, after this, I am no
longer pushing my limits.

537
00:40:26.795 --> 00:40:29.431
I'm only working on dry land

538
00:40:29.497 --> 00:40:32.767
and preferably close
to a place where

539
00:40:32.833 --> 00:40:35.003
I can get a drink.

540
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:36.471
Sure I can't interest you
in a three-week

541
00:40:36.538 --> 00:40:38.473
editorial shoot through
polar bear country?

542
00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.275
That was next up on
our to-do list.

543
00:40:41.976 --> 00:40:44.079
Hey, do you mind handing me
that knife?

544
00:40:44.145 --> 00:40:46.648
I'll cut both
of our wrists.

545
00:40:51.319 --> 00:40:53.355
Okay.
You ready to get to moving?

546
00:40:54.689 --> 00:40:56.124
Yeah.

547
00:41:15.944 --> 00:41:17.312
That's it, Meg.

548
00:41:20.482 --> 00:41:21.850
Sarah... Sarah?

549
00:41:21.916 --> 00:41:24.386
It's a shark! It's a shark!
It's a shark!

550
00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:45.940
It's a dolphin.

551
00:41:46.007 --> 00:41:47.509
What?
Are you sure?

552
00:41:53.381 --> 00:41:55.984
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no, that's a shark.

553
00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:58.052
That's a shark!

554
00:42:01.656 --> 00:42:02.991
Shark!

555
00:42:06.461 --> 00:42:08.096
Paddle!

556
00:42:09.464 --> 00:42:11.032
Oh, no, oh, no!

557
00:42:14.769 --> 00:42:16.471
Sarah, wait!

558
00:42:16.538 --> 00:42:17.772
What?

559
00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:19.441
Listen to me, please!

560
00:42:19.507 --> 00:42:21.342
What?

561
00:42:21.409 --> 00:42:24.479
Sharks are attracted to
vibrations, right?

562
00:42:24.546 --> 00:42:26.614
Maybe they're attracted
to our paddling.

563
00:42:26.681 --> 00:42:30.652
So maybe if we stand still,
they won't find us.

564
00:42:33.288 --> 00:42:35.323
Dude, we can make it.

565
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.259
You know what?
I'm not going to make it!

566
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.235
I'll stay with you.

567
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:50.738
Okay, I'll stay with you.

568
00:43:00.482 --> 00:43:02.584
Okay, hold there.

569
00:43:04.886 --> 00:43:06.988
If we tie our kayaks together,

570
00:43:07.055 --> 00:43:09.624
we can make one shape
in the water.

571
00:43:09.691 --> 00:43:11.226
It'll make us look bigger,
not like something

572
00:43:11.292 --> 00:43:13.228
that that thing
can eat, okay?

573
00:43:13.294 --> 00:43:16.097
I'm gonna hold on to this.

574
00:43:16.164 --> 00:43:17.699
Catch this.

575
00:43:23.404 --> 00:43:25.273
This will hopefully buy us
enough time to rest

576
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.375
and then we can just
make it to that island.

577
00:43:32.948 --> 00:43:34.382
Okay, pull your paddle in.

578
00:43:56.704 --> 00:43:58.673
Where is it?

579
00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.542
Shh! Be quiet.

580
00:44:10.718 --> 00:44:13.054
Sarah? Sarah?

581
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:49.424
We're fine.

582
00:44:57.332 --> 00:44:59.367
Did you see its eyes roll back?

583
00:44:59.434 --> 00:45:01.502
What does that mean?

584
00:45:01.569 --> 00:45:03.605
When it bites into
something it can't see.

585
00:45:08.944 --> 00:45:11.046
Is it still right here?

586
00:45:11.112 --> 00:45:12.380
I don't know.

587
00:45:24.792 --> 00:45:27.195
Hey, are you girls okay?

588
00:45:27.261 --> 00:45:28.763
Get out! Get out!

589
00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.798
Meghan! Meghan!

590
00:45:33.936 --> 00:45:35.570
Do you need any help?

591
00:46:09.138 --> 00:46:10.772
Come on, come on!

592
00:46:10.838 --> 00:46:12.306
We gotta get over there.

593
00:46:12.373 --> 00:46:13.474
He's dead, Sarah.

594
00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:15.777
Sarah, stop.
Sarah, stop!

595
00:46:15.843 --> 00:46:16.945
He's dead!

596
00:46:17.012 --> 00:46:18.981
Sarah, listen to me!

597
00:46:19.048 --> 00:46:20.049
The man's dead!

598
00:46:20.115 --> 00:46:21.482
We can get over there.

599
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:22.717
The man's dead!

600
00:46:22.784 --> 00:46:24.352
We can reach that!
We can get...

601
00:46:24.419 --> 00:46:27.089
Sarah, you're not thinking!

602
00:46:27.156 --> 00:46:30.591
The lanyard fell
down with him!

603
00:46:30.658 --> 00:46:32.593
It's a Sea-Doo, okay?

604
00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.796
So even if we got
to the jet ski,

605
00:46:34.862 --> 00:46:36.898
the lanyard still fell down
with the rider!

606
00:46:36.965 --> 00:46:40.802
So it's not going to start!
Do you got it?

607
00:46:45.908 --> 00:46:47.742
Come on, we gotta go!

608
00:46:50.244 --> 00:46:51.512
Come on.

609
00:46:51.579 --> 00:46:54.415
- Please, just help me!
- Okay! Okay.

610
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:30.018
Sarah!

611
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.024
Look! Look!
There's a sandbar!

612
00:47:36.091 --> 00:47:38.359
We can make it!
Come on!

613
00:48:07.256 --> 00:48:09.423
What do you want?

614
00:48:16.864 --> 00:48:20.735
Sarah, this is me calling
in to check with you!

615
00:48:20.802 --> 00:48:23.071
I hope you're hangin' in tight.

616
00:48:23.138 --> 00:48:26.041
Air Patrol has a decent lock
on your position there.

617
00:48:26.108 --> 00:48:28.709
It's a ballpark estimate
because they don't have

618
00:48:28.776 --> 00:48:33.081
enough cell towers out there
to triangulate your location.

619
00:48:33.148 --> 00:48:34.549
But once they get in the air,

620
00:48:34.615 --> 00:48:36.952
they should be able
to pick you out.

621
00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:39.288
We're checkin' on the
outer islands, okay?

622
00:48:39.353 --> 00:48:40.989
So call me back.

623
00:48:41.056 --> 00:48:43.591
Call me back, honey,
call me back.

624
00:49:05.113 --> 00:49:06.547
Hey, it's Sarah.

625
00:49:06.614 --> 00:49:08.217
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

626
00:49:08.283 --> 00:49:11.153
Sarah, honey, listen.
I hope you're safe.

627
00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:14.689
I wanted to let you know that
the helicopter is up in the air.

628
00:49:14.755 --> 00:49:18.626
Marine Patrol is synching
with the Coast Guard.

629
00:49:18.693 --> 00:49:21.230
All hands are on deck
to get you home.

630
00:49:21.296 --> 00:49:23.631
I wanted to give
you some good news.

631
00:49:23.698 --> 00:49:25.766
Right now, where
you're at is experiencing

632
00:49:25.833 --> 00:49:27.869
what they call the king tides.

633
00:49:27.936 --> 00:49:30.138
It's a phenomenon having
to do with

634
00:49:30.205 --> 00:49:32.274
the moon being in its pedigree.

635
00:49:32.341 --> 00:49:37.145
The part of Florida where
you're at can get to real bad.

636
00:49:37.212 --> 00:49:39.147
It's a full moon tonight and

637
00:49:39.214 --> 00:49:41.016
When the tide comes in,
there's a chance there won't be

638
00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:44.119
any dry land left
in the entire basin.

639
00:49:44.186 --> 00:49:46.787
It'll flood all the
little islands

640
00:49:46.854 --> 00:49:51.425
until the Keys on the outer
edge of the Florida Bay.

641
00:49:51.492 --> 00:49:55.763
Do whatever you can to find the
highest ground and wait it out.

642
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.531
I've always said that
I would go through

643
00:49:57.598 --> 00:50:00.102
hell and high water
to keep you safe.

644
00:50:00.168 --> 00:50:02.037
Now I know you've been
through hell

645
00:50:02.104 --> 00:50:07.175
and now you're gonna have to
go through high water, okay?

646
00:50:07.242 --> 00:50:08.843
Hang in there, honey.

647
00:50:08.911 --> 00:50:12.647
Hang in there because help
is on the way, okay?

648
00:50:12.713 --> 00:50:14.615
Your dad loves you.

649
00:50:38.073 --> 00:50:39.540
I'm sorry.

650
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:43.711
I know.

651
00:50:45.513 --> 00:50:48.283
I knew.

652
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:50.484
Jason never stopped loving you.

653
00:50:52.087 --> 00:50:54.722
I didn't even want
to come on this gig.

654
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:56.224
I didn't want
to come on this gig

655
00:50:56.291 --> 00:50:57.858
because I knew he was
still in love with you.

656
00:50:57.926 --> 00:50:59.227
And I know you guys broke up!

657
00:51:01.762 --> 00:51:04.166
And I wouldn't
have been with him

658
00:51:04.232 --> 00:51:06.068
if you guys were still together!

659
00:51:09.271 --> 00:51:12.140
You may not have loved him,

660
00:51:12.207 --> 00:51:13.641
but I did.

661
00:51:17.245 --> 00:51:18.679
And now he's gone.

662
00:51:23.651 --> 00:51:26.154
This is not what I wanted!

663
00:51:26.221 --> 00:51:28.689
Goddamn it!
This is not what I planned!

664
00:51:30.658 --> 00:51:34.463
I wanted a white picket fence!
I wanted...

665
00:51:34.528 --> 00:51:36.164
I wanted a dog!

666
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:37.598
I wanted...

667
00:51:39.434 --> 00:51:40.634
Jason.

668
00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:45.806
You had everything and
you threw it all away.

669
00:51:52.214 --> 00:51:53.681
I think you should know...

670
00:51:57.651 --> 00:52:00.621
this is not what
I planned for my life either!

671
00:52:03.624 --> 00:52:05.860
I'm not going down by shark.

672
00:52:07.595 --> 00:52:09.231
Yeah.

673
00:52:09.297 --> 00:52:10.966
How you wanna go down then?

674
00:52:14.936 --> 00:52:18.306
I don't know, but I'll
tell you one thing.

675
00:52:20.674 --> 00:52:23.311
This? Right here, all of this?

676
00:52:24.779 --> 00:52:26.547
This is not it!

677
00:52:30.318 --> 00:52:35.257
And I don't wanna be laying down
in some hospital bed

678
00:52:35.323 --> 00:52:38.460
tied up to machines with tubes
coming out of every

679
00:52:38.527 --> 00:52:43.564
hole in my body, just dwindling
while my family watches!

680
00:52:47.235 --> 00:52:51.339
I don't want to be
sitting there

681
00:52:51.406 --> 00:52:54.409
trying to find
something to say

682
00:52:54.476 --> 00:52:55.743
to make it all better.

683
00:53:02.716 --> 00:53:07.255
I wanna be 100 years old

684
00:53:07.322 --> 00:53:10.258
and surrounded by grandchildren.

685
00:53:12.227 --> 00:53:15.896
And I wanna be drinking
the best mug of tea

686
00:53:15.964 --> 00:53:18.300
you've ever had
in your entire life.

687
00:53:21.536 --> 00:53:24.106
That's how I'm gonna go out.

688
00:53:30.678 --> 00:53:33.515
You wanna die by tea?

689
00:53:33.582 --> 00:53:35.183
Yeah.

690
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:38.120
I think dying by tea sounds
really nice right about now.

691
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:42.723
I thought tea extended
your life.

692
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:45.127
No. Talking about sweet tea.

693
00:53:45.193 --> 00:53:47.496
Oh, with sugar.

694
00:53:47.562 --> 00:53:49.797
And lemon.

695
00:53:49.864 --> 00:53:51.600
Lemon's good for you.

696
00:53:51.665 --> 00:53:55.570
Sugar? I don't approve.
It's bad. It's bad for you.

697
00:53:55.636 --> 00:53:57.205
You have a problem with sugar?

698
00:53:57.272 --> 00:53:59.141
Yeah, I have a problem
with sugar.

699
00:53:59.207 --> 00:54:00.875
Oh, my God.

700
00:54:00.942 --> 00:54:03.278
Yeah, I don't know if we can
be friends after this.

701
00:54:03.345 --> 00:54:04.678
Me either.

702
00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:16.024
Was that your mom...
who you were talking about?

703
00:54:19.327 --> 00:54:20.661
Is that how she...

704
00:54:27.701 --> 00:54:28.869
Cancer.

705
00:54:31.805 --> 00:54:33.074
By the time they caught it,

706
00:54:33.141 --> 00:54:34.509
there wasn't much
we could do

707
00:54:34.576 --> 00:54:36.178
except...

708
00:54:37.412 --> 00:54:38.846
sit and watch.

709
00:54:45.654 --> 00:54:46.988
That's...

710
00:54:51.759 --> 00:54:54.129
After that is when Jason
and I decided to split.

711
00:54:59.434 --> 00:55:03.138
I need you to know
that I did love him.

712
00:55:03.205 --> 00:55:04.772
I did.

713
00:55:07.676 --> 00:55:09.777
But I wasn't in love with him.

714
00:55:11.879 --> 00:55:13.415
And watching my mom,

715
00:55:17.552 --> 00:55:19.820
it just made me
re-evaluate everything.

716
00:55:25.193 --> 00:55:30.131
It made me realize that
that wasn't fair to him.

717
00:55:30.198 --> 00:55:34.970
It wasn't fair to keep him
in that when I knew that

718
00:55:35.036 --> 00:55:37.072
there was someone that
could love him better.

719
00:55:40.342 --> 00:55:42.010
Someone like you.

720
00:55:46.414 --> 00:55:51.885
That's why when I saw
him today, with you,

721
00:55:51.953 --> 00:55:54.990
and he was smiling
and he was laughing

722
00:55:55.056 --> 00:55:57.058
like a real Jason laugh.

723
00:56:01.496 --> 00:56:02.931
I was happy for him.

724
00:56:03.831 --> 00:56:06.767
I was. I was happy for him.

725
00:56:07.669 --> 00:56:12.107
That is what he deserves.

726
00:56:14.142 --> 00:56:15.477
It's what he deserved.

727
00:56:30.125 --> 00:56:31.859
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sarah!

728
00:56:31.926 --> 00:56:33.628
Sarah!
Sarah, Sarah!

729
00:56:33.695 --> 00:56:36.498
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

730
00:56:36.564 --> 00:56:39.100
Hey, over here!

731
00:56:39.167 --> 00:56:42.237
Hey, hey!

732
00:56:42.304 --> 00:56:44.939
- We're right here!
- We're over here!

733
00:56:47.342 --> 00:56:49.711
- Right here!
- Over here!

734
00:56:49.778 --> 00:56:51.112
Hey!

735
00:56:56.117 --> 00:56:58.019
Come on! Get the kayak.

736
00:57:01.189 --> 00:57:02.823
Ready, left to right,
left to right, tilt it.

737
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:06.961
- Hey!
- Hey!

738
00:57:07.028 --> 00:57:08.896
- Hey!
- Hey!

739
00:57:16.971 --> 00:57:18.440
Okay, just... just...

740
00:57:20.108 --> 00:57:21.543
Get your phone!

741
00:57:21.609 --> 00:57:23.111
Get your phone and
see if you got any service!

742
00:57:23.178 --> 00:57:25.046
I put a solar charger
in the dry bag!

743
00:57:28.383 --> 00:57:31.319
Full bars, but
the charger's not working!

744
00:57:31.386 --> 00:57:34.622
- Let me do it.
- What the heck?

745
00:57:34.689 --> 00:57:35.856
I got it, I got it!

746
00:57:37.625 --> 00:57:39.094
There's water in it.

747
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.295
Yeah, it hasn't
been charging.

748
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.602
Meghan, we probably
just need to lay it out.

749
00:57:47.669 --> 00:57:49.571
- Just set it down.
- I'm trying to get it in.

750
00:57:49.637 --> 00:57:51.439
It hasn't been charging.

751
00:57:51.506 --> 00:57:53.308
It's dead.
Just let it go!

752
00:57:53.375 --> 00:57:55.310
Work!

753
00:57:55.377 --> 00:57:58.046
It's not gonna work.

754
00:57:58.113 --> 00:57:59.581
Let it go, just...

755
00:57:59.647 --> 00:58:00.749
It's connected.

756
00:58:00.815 --> 00:58:02.550
There, go, put it in.

757
00:58:06.721 --> 00:58:07.922
Oh my God.

758
00:58:09.124 --> 00:58:10.291
You fixed it.

759
00:58:12.627 --> 00:58:14.329
How'd you do it?

760
00:58:14.396 --> 00:58:16.164
Whoever said watching
random YouTube videos

761
00:58:16.231 --> 00:58:18.366
was stupid is wrong.

762
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.912
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah?

763
00:58:30.979 --> 00:58:32.881
Whoa, we were just
there a minute ago

764
00:58:32.947 --> 00:58:35.383
and now it's underwater!

765
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:38.086
What are we gonna do if this
whole thing goes underwater?

766
00:58:40.321 --> 00:58:42.323
We still have the kayaks.

767
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:44.592
I'm not getting back
into that water!

768
00:58:44.659 --> 00:58:47.429
I think you were on to something
with the movement thing.

769
00:58:47.495 --> 00:58:49.364
We can just
minimize our movement

770
00:58:49.431 --> 00:58:51.332
and stick to the shallow areas.

771
00:58:51.399 --> 00:58:53.501
That thing is right
next to shore!

772
00:58:53.568 --> 00:58:56.604
I know that, but
you're not helping, okay?

773
00:58:56.671 --> 00:58:59.274
Right now, I need you
to look at the bright side!

774
00:58:59.340 --> 00:59:03.011
Yeah? And what is that?

775
00:59:03.077 --> 00:59:04.446
We're not dead yet!

776
00:59:04.512 --> 00:59:07.415
Oh, right, yeah.
We're not dead yet.

777
00:59:08.583 --> 00:59:12.020
We're just stranded
on an island.

778
00:59:12.086 --> 00:59:15.056
A shark's trying to hunt us,

779
00:59:15.123 --> 00:59:18.226
the sea plane can't find us.

780
00:59:18.293 --> 00:59:22.363
And now the island is flooding!

781
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.665
What next?

782
00:59:23.731 --> 00:59:25.967
The shark's just gonna
turn into a tornado?

783
00:59:26.034 --> 00:59:27.602
I can't do this anymore, Sarah!

784
00:59:33.675 --> 00:59:35.477
Um...

785
00:59:45.753 --> 00:59:46.788
Yeah, hello? Sarah?

786
00:59:46.855 --> 00:59:48.323
Dad, dad!

787
00:59:48.389 --> 00:59:49.724
Yeah, it's me.
How are you doing?

788
00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:51.927
Yes, we're fine,
but I just saw a chopper.

789
00:59:51.993 --> 00:59:55.330
It was a single-engine chopper.
I think it was them.

790
00:59:55.396 --> 00:59:57.232
Well, that was it!
That's great!

791
00:59:57.298 --> 01:00:00.301
Can you give me more
information about the fly-by?

792
01:00:00.368 --> 01:00:02.972
That'll help me figure
out where exactly you are!

793
01:00:03.037 --> 01:00:04.305
They flew right over us.

794
01:00:04.372 --> 01:00:08.944
They flew right over us
to the east

795
01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:10.778
and way north, Dad, way north!

796
01:00:10.845 --> 01:00:12.313
Well, that's helpful.

797
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.082
They've been searching
on the other islands

798
01:00:14.148 --> 01:00:15.750
and they're expanding
from there.

799
01:00:15.817 --> 01:00:19.420
No, no, no!
We didn't go to Cudjoe Key, Dad!

800
01:00:19.487 --> 01:00:22.323
No, we're on this new island.

801
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:25.260
Jason said it just
formed in the hurricane.

802
01:00:25.326 --> 01:00:26.828
It just formed
like a month ago.

803
01:00:26.895 --> 01:00:28.563
And I don't even think
it's on their maps.

804
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:32.600
You must be south, southwest
of the search area.

805
01:00:32.667 --> 01:00:35.236
I'll have them modify
their search grid.

806
01:00:35.303 --> 01:00:36.538
If you can keep
your phone on,

807
01:00:36.604 --> 01:00:38.673
we might be
able to get a better lock

808
01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.175
on your new location.

809
01:00:41.242 --> 01:00:43.979
I don't think we have much time.

810
01:00:44.045 --> 01:00:46.281
We may not be able
to stay here long.

811
01:00:46.347 --> 01:00:47.815
The water's rising.

812
01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:51.921
Okay, then stay calm, stay calm.

813
01:00:51.987 --> 01:00:53.621
Dad...

814
01:00:53.688 --> 01:00:57.859
Your area is experiencing a peak
of what they call king tides.

815
01:00:57.927 --> 01:00:59.627
You know about king tides?

816
01:00:59.694 --> 01:01:02.196
Yes, I know about king tides.
They're higher than normal.

817
01:01:02.263 --> 01:01:03.933
That's right.
Much higher.

818
01:01:03.999 --> 01:01:09.972
Unfortunately, that area you're
in can be particularly hard hit.

819
01:01:10.039 --> 01:01:13.976
It's the equivalent
of experiencing a storm surge,

820
01:01:14.043 --> 01:01:15.710
but it's with the tide alone.

821
01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:18.948
It's not based on weather,
but the phase of the moon.

822
01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:20.848
The stats tell me

823
01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:25.921
all the islands out there
may be overwhelmed.

824
01:01:25.988 --> 01:01:29.557
Hello?
You still there?

825
01:01:29.624 --> 01:01:31.326
Yes.

826
01:01:31.392 --> 01:01:32.560
You still have your kayaks?

827
01:01:32.627 --> 01:01:34.796
Yes, we have the kayaks,
Dad, but...

828
01:01:34.862 --> 01:01:37.699
Listen. I know this is gonna
be difficult

829
01:01:37.765 --> 01:01:39.834
and I wish I could
be there with you.

830
01:01:39.902 --> 01:01:42.670
But you and Meghan
have done great so far.

831
01:01:42.737 --> 01:01:44.172
You keep up what
you've been doing.

832
01:01:44.238 --> 01:01:46.441
It's been keeping
you both alive.

833
01:01:46.507 --> 01:01:49.611
Dad, be honest with me:

834
01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:54.749
if they don't find us
by sundown,

835
01:01:54.816 --> 01:01:57.819
are you guys gonna
suspend the search?

836
01:01:57.885 --> 01:01:59.287
We will find you, honey.

837
01:01:59.354 --> 01:02:01.957
We will find you!

838
01:02:02.024 --> 01:02:03.358
I know.

839
01:02:03.424 --> 01:02:04.859
I know that you
won't give up, Dad.

840
01:02:04.927 --> 01:02:08.563
But if the tides are as
powerful as you say,

841
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:11.232
and...

842
01:02:11.299 --> 01:02:13.534
and if you guys have
to suspend the search,

843
01:02:13.601 --> 01:02:15.703
I just want you
to know that we tried.

844
01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:20.575
The spotter helicopter
will find you!

845
01:02:20.642 --> 01:02:24.046
I just want you to know
that I love you

846
01:02:24.113 --> 01:02:25.747
and I went out fighting.

847
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:29.985
Stay on the line.

848
01:02:30.052 --> 01:02:31.653
I'm not gonna let you down.

849
01:02:31.719 --> 01:02:35.623
I've never done
that before, have I?

850
01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:36.959
Okay, okay.

851
01:02:38.027 --> 01:02:40.762
- Dad!
- Sarah!

852
01:02:40.828 --> 01:02:42.064
Sarah, hello!

853
01:02:42.131 --> 01:02:44.599
Dad!

854
01:03:10.491 --> 01:03:12.260
Civic Air Patrol,
Darren speaking.

855
01:03:12.326 --> 01:03:14.696
Hello, it's James Murray.

856
01:03:14.762 --> 01:03:16.831
I'm just off the phone
with my daughter.

857
01:03:16.898 --> 01:03:20.368
We have a new data set
for cellphone forensics.

858
01:03:20.435 --> 01:03:23.438
I had her on the line for
approximately three minutes.

859
01:03:23.504 --> 01:03:26.507
We need to expand the search
from our initial grid.

860
01:03:26.574 --> 01:03:29.444
I have new information
on her location.

861
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:33.281
Our initial search area,
I believe, was incorrect.

862
01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:36.617
They traveled to a new
location, another island.

863
01:03:36.684 --> 01:03:39.620
With the king tides,
the water is rising fast.

864
01:03:39.687 --> 01:03:41.489
Stand by.
I'll get right back to you.

865
01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:43.658
Copy that.
I'll get back to you soon.

866
01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:02.276
This island's flooded.

867
01:04:05.981 --> 01:04:07.381
We gotta go.

868
01:04:20.762 --> 01:04:21.964
We got this.

869
01:05:12.014 --> 01:05:15.250
I talked to Fish and Wildlife
and the NOAA Fisheries

870
01:05:15.316 --> 01:05:17.152
Southeast Marine
Mammal Stranding

871
01:05:17.219 --> 01:05:18.352
Network coordinator.

872
01:05:18.419 --> 01:05:19.854
You're not going
to believe this!

873
01:05:19.922 --> 01:05:22.824
Apparently a pod of pilot
whales stranded and died

874
01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:25.593
on the outer shoals
of Cudjoe Basin

875
01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.095
approximately two weeks ago.

876
01:05:27.162 --> 01:05:29.897
They tell me it was a
about thirty whales.

877
01:05:29.965 --> 01:05:32.400
It may have had something
to do with the hurricane.

878
01:05:32.466 --> 01:05:33.969
No-one knows.

879
01:05:34.036 --> 01:05:36.271
They were stranded and died
in the shallow water.

880
01:05:36.337 --> 01:05:39.507
Standard operating procedure
when something like that happens

881
01:05:39.574 --> 01:05:41.210
out there in such
a remote area is

882
01:05:41.276 --> 01:05:44.745
to leave the carcasses to
decay and return to nature,

883
01:05:44.812 --> 01:05:47.950
which NOAA confirmed they did.

884
01:05:48.016 --> 01:05:50.852
So there are whale carcasses
in the water down there?

885
01:05:50.919 --> 01:05:54.822
There were whales carcasses.
It gets complicated.

886
01:05:54.889 --> 01:05:57.259
Apparently NOAA began
receiving reports

887
01:05:57.326 --> 01:06:00.428
from boaters and fishermen
of a massive great white shark

888
01:06:00.494 --> 01:06:02.430
feeding on the whales' remains.

889
01:06:02.496 --> 01:06:04.166
It was reported to be
a six-meter shark.

890
01:06:04.233 --> 01:06:06.634
Great whites are seasonal
visitors to the Keys.

891
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:09.137
It is unusual for something
like this to show up

892
01:06:09.204 --> 01:06:11.405
in that area on the back side
of the keys.

893
01:06:11.472 --> 01:06:14.142
Well, sure, but if there's
something drawing it in

894
01:06:14.209 --> 01:06:16.945
like a pod of dead whales...

895
01:06:17.012 --> 01:06:20.082
Right, So after reports of the
large shark feeding in the area,

896
01:06:20.148 --> 01:06:23.018
NOAA decided to remove
the carcasses from the water

897
01:06:23.085 --> 01:06:26.621
in hopes that the shark
would leave.

898
01:06:26.687 --> 01:06:28.656
And that didn't happen?

899
01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:30.725
Well, they did
remove the carcasses,

900
01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:32.627
but the shark didn't leave.

901
01:06:32.693 --> 01:06:35.563
Does this explain
the shark's behavior?

902
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:39.334
I put in a call to
the Mote Marine Laboratory.

903
01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.736
They have a few theories on what
is going on with the shark.

904
01:06:41.802 --> 01:06:44.106
Sharks are opportunistic feeders

905
01:06:44.172 --> 01:06:46.807
and finding something like
a whale is a rare opportunity.

906
01:06:46.874 --> 01:06:49.378
When they find a
large source of food

907
01:06:49.443 --> 01:06:51.113
such as those whale carcasses,

908
01:06:51.179 --> 01:06:53.581
the shark's appetite expands
to take advantage of the bounty.

909
01:06:53.648 --> 01:06:55.750
So basically the
appetite increases

910
01:06:55.816 --> 01:06:58.987
relative to the
availability of food.

911
01:06:59.054 --> 01:07:02.291
Encountering a dead whale for
a shark is a rare opportunity.

912
01:07:02.357 --> 01:07:05.093
And the expansion of appetite
is a natural way for the shark

913
01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.663
to take advantage of an abundant
food supply while it lasts.

914
01:07:08.729 --> 01:07:10.933
It turbo charges
their appetites.

915
01:07:10.999 --> 01:07:13.601
This allows the shark to go
from feast to famine

916
01:07:13.668 --> 01:07:16.537
and survive periods
when it cannot find food,

917
01:07:16.604 --> 01:07:18.373
kind of like a lion at a kill.

918
01:07:18.439 --> 01:07:21.076
When it has to, it can eat many
times more food than normal.

919
01:07:21.143 --> 01:07:23.946
And this keeps it going
through lean times.

920
01:07:24.012 --> 01:07:26.214
So the presence of
the whale carcass

921
01:07:26.281 --> 01:07:29.750
increases the shark's appetite.

922
01:07:29.817 --> 01:07:32.387
And when they removed
the whales,

923
01:07:32.453 --> 01:07:35.190
instead of driving
the shark away,

924
01:07:35.257 --> 01:07:38.492
they left the shark
with super-sized appetite

925
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.329
looking for prey.

926
01:07:40.395 --> 01:07:43.564
That's one of the theories,
and it makes sense to me.

927
01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:46.201
The biologists also surmise
that the shark

928
01:07:46.268 --> 01:07:49.104
may have become more aggressive
in a territorial manner.

929
01:07:49.171 --> 01:07:51.472
It may have had
to drive off other predators

930
01:07:51.539 --> 01:07:53.275
from the whale carcasses.

931
01:07:53.342 --> 01:07:54.709
If it's going after the kayaks,

932
01:07:54.775 --> 01:07:57.112
it could be defending
it's territory.

933
01:07:57.179 --> 01:07:59.948
The last theory is what
they call a rogue shark.

934
01:08:00.015 --> 01:08:02.550
This is a shark that,
for whatever reason,

935
01:08:02.616 --> 01:08:03.986
goes on a spree of attacks.

936
01:08:04.052 --> 01:08:07.356
There is historical
precedence for this,

937
01:08:07.422 --> 01:08:10.624
a few instances where a single
shark made multiple attacks.

938
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:12.260
It's rare.
but it happens.

939
01:08:12.327 --> 01:08:14.729
Well, it sounds like it could
be a combination of both.

940
01:08:14.795 --> 01:08:17.832
We gotta find them and
get them off the water.

941
01:08:17.898 --> 01:08:20.735
And then make sure we're
searching for the right area.

942
01:08:20.801 --> 01:08:22.904
I know there are a lot
of islands out there.

943
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:25.374
But based on
their original position,

944
01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.977
I think we've been searching
the wrong area.

945
01:08:29.044 --> 01:08:30.912
I know what the forensics
have been saying.

946
01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:35.283
But Sarah told me they paddled
out to a brand new sandbar.

947
01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:37.752
Listen, these sandbars change.

948
01:08:37.818 --> 01:08:41.189
New ones form and
old ones disappear.

949
01:08:41.256 --> 01:08:42.857
I don 't think that
they were at any of the ones

950
01:08:42.924 --> 01:08:44.692
that we have on our maps.

951
01:08:44.759 --> 01:08:46.028
Copy that.

952
01:08:46.094 --> 01:08:47.295
Right now,
we're pushing the limit

953
01:08:47.362 --> 01:08:48.964
on our flying time out here.

954
01:08:49.031 --> 01:08:51.665
We can do a redirect depending
on where you tell me.

955
01:08:51.732 --> 01:08:53.701
That would involve a refueling.

956
01:08:53.768 --> 01:08:56.238
If that were to happen,
we'd have to go back

957
01:08:56.304 --> 01:08:58.006
to the airstrip to refuel,

958
01:08:58.073 --> 01:09:01.009
which would not allow us enough
daylight to finish our search.

959
01:09:01.076 --> 01:09:04.179
Are they still out
over the Cudjoe Basin?

960
01:09:04.246 --> 01:09:07.015
I mean, I think they can
manage this without refueling.

961
01:09:07.082 --> 01:09:08.682
Copy that.
It's your decision.

962
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:10.218
But you do know if
we run out of fuel,

963
01:09:10.285 --> 01:09:11.685
that'll be the end of
the search for today.

964
01:09:11.752 --> 01:09:13.121
All right, I got you.

965
01:09:13.188 --> 01:09:14.289
Listen.

966
01:09:14.356 --> 01:09:16.425
Now they said they
saw your helicopter.

967
01:09:16.491 --> 01:09:19.494
You can't be too far off.

968
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.929
Copy.
What is your redirect?

969
01:09:20.996 --> 01:09:24.232
I want you to change
the search grid, okay?

970
01:09:24.299 --> 01:09:28.070
We need to look on the same
line, but further south.

971
01:09:28.136 --> 01:09:32.807
If you only have fuel
enough to search one more place,

972
01:09:32.873 --> 01:09:34.443
then this would be it.

973
01:09:34.509 --> 01:09:36.978
If this information's
incorrect, it's on you.

974
01:09:37.045 --> 01:09:39.747
Sir, this is my
daughter out there!

975
01:09:39.814 --> 01:09:42.583
If this is a rogue
shark attack like you say,

976
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:44.819
we don't have time to waste!

977
01:09:44.885 --> 01:09:47.655
So please change
your search grid

978
01:09:47.721 --> 01:09:49.690
to the coordinates that follow.

979
01:10:06.607 --> 01:10:08.276
I see it!

980
01:10:08.343 --> 01:10:09.478
I see it, it's coming back!
It's coming back this way!

981
01:10:09.544 --> 01:10:10.479
Where?

982
01:10:10.545 --> 01:10:11.879
Sarah, it's right there!

983
01:10:11.947 --> 01:10:13.081
It's right there!
It's right there!

984
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:16.617
What do we do?
What do we do?

985
01:10:16.684 --> 01:10:18.253
Shh.

986
01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.921
Hold position.

987
01:10:37.805 --> 01:10:39.241
Stay calm!

988
01:10:54.122 --> 01:10:56.424
Meghan, I need you
to stay calm.

989
01:11:17.112 --> 01:11:18.280
Over here!

990
01:11:27.088 --> 01:11:28.957
Hold on, I'm gonna try
and flag him down.

991
01:11:33.195 --> 01:11:34.728
Come on!

992
01:11:39.334 --> 01:11:41.735
We have visual on the kayakers.
We have visual!

993
01:11:52.347 --> 01:11:54.049
Yeah, let me get
a little bit closer.

994
01:12:01.556 --> 01:12:02.790
Hey!

995
01:12:08.597 --> 01:12:10.632
Oh, there's a massive shark
circling the kayakers.

996
01:12:10.699 --> 01:12:12.000
Let me get a picture.

997
01:12:21.042 --> 01:12:22.644
All right, picture sent.

998
01:12:22.711 --> 01:12:25.914
We need to send a boat.
I can't get to the swimmers.

999
01:12:25.981 --> 01:12:28.782
Running low on fuel.
Headed back to base to refuel.

1000
01:12:32.587 --> 01:12:36.057
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1001
01:13:09.457 --> 01:13:11.393
Yeah, hello?

1002
01:13:11.459 --> 01:13:13.094
I just got your message!

1003
01:13:13.161 --> 01:13:14.929
Can't you land in there
and just pick them up?

1004
01:13:14.996 --> 01:13:16.665
That's a negative.

1005
01:13:16.731 --> 01:13:18.466
There's too many submerged
reefs where they're at.

1006
01:13:18.533 --> 01:13:21.136
How much is the draft
on that helicopter?

1007
01:13:21.202 --> 01:13:22.771
It's not the draft
of the chopper,

1008
01:13:22.836 --> 01:13:24.139
it's the water clarity.

1009
01:13:24.205 --> 01:13:26.541
Right now, the visual is
not clear enough

1010
01:13:26.608 --> 01:13:30.878
for our pilot to choose
a safe patch for landing.

1011
01:13:30.945 --> 01:13:32.880
We're directing a
boat to them now.

1012
01:13:32.947 --> 01:13:34.882
How long is it gonna take?

1013
01:13:34.949 --> 01:13:36.685
It should be under 10 minutes.

1014
01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:42.424
Can you guys in the helicopter
keep an eye on the shark?

1015
01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:44.059
That's a negative.

1016
01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:46.928
The spotter chopper has
to refuel and return to base.

1017
01:13:46.995 --> 01:13:48.596
Oh, come on!

1018
01:13:48.663 --> 01:13:50.765
I'm sorry. If that
chopper doesn't return to base

1019
01:13:50.831 --> 01:13:53.535
now to refuel,
it may not make it back.

1020
01:13:53.601 --> 01:13:57.105
Let me know the minute that
the boat reaches them.

1021
01:13:59.474 --> 01:14:00.909
They're gonna
come back, Meghan.

1022
01:14:00.975 --> 01:14:02.310
They're not gonna leave us here!

1023
01:14:02.377 --> 01:14:03.945
How do we know
they're gonna come back?

1024
01:14:04.012 --> 01:14:07.182
Stay calm.
They're going to come back.

1025
01:14:07.248 --> 01:14:09.117
Trust me!

1026
01:14:18.259 --> 01:14:19.394
Where's it going?
Where's it going?

1027
01:14:19.461 --> 01:14:20.395
Where's it going?

1028
01:14:37.712 --> 01:14:39.147
Where the hell did it go?

1029
01:14:41.449 --> 01:14:42.584
Oh!

1030
01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:44.586
There's a boat!
There's a boat!

1031
01:14:44.652 --> 01:14:45.820
Where?

1032
01:14:45.886 --> 01:14:47.021
Hey! Come on!
Head over here!

1033
01:14:47.088 --> 01:14:48.056
- That's them!

1034
01:14:48.123 --> 01:14:50.891
- Hey!
- Hey!

1035
01:14:50.959 --> 01:14:52.560
Over here!

1036
01:14:54.095 --> 01:14:55.797
There's a reef there!
It's too shallow!

1037
01:14:55.864 --> 01:14:57.699
Come to us!

1038
01:14:57.766 --> 01:14:59.067
Paddle, paddle!

1039
01:14:59.134 --> 01:15:01.536
Come on. Let's go!

1040
01:15:08.843 --> 01:15:11.846
Hey!

1041
01:15:11.913 --> 01:15:13.815
Hey, come to us!

1042
01:15:13.882 --> 01:15:15.583
Please!

1043
01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:17.218
No! You have to come to us!

1044
01:15:17.285 --> 01:15:18.153
Come on!

1045
01:15:18.219 --> 01:15:19.421
Please meet us!

1046
01:15:21.089 --> 01:15:23.057
Meghan!

1047
01:15:23.925 --> 01:15:25.260
Here.

1048
01:15:27.061 --> 01:15:28.430
Meghan!

1049
01:15:33.234 --> 01:15:36.004
Grab my paddle!

1050
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:37.639
Grab my hand!
I got you! I got you!

1051
01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:39.441
Come on!

1052
01:15:42.811 --> 01:15:45.013
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

1053
01:15:52.887 --> 01:15:54.722
Where is it?
Do you see it?

1054
01:15:57.592 --> 01:16:00.094
I don't see it!
I don't see it, Sarah!

1055
01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:02.932
That way.
Go that way! That way!

1056
01:16:19.747 --> 01:16:21.316
I lost the knife!

1057
01:16:21.382 --> 01:16:23.818
Come on! Come on!
Hurry up!

1058
01:16:23.885 --> 01:16:25.487
Go! Go, Meghan!

1059
01:17:14.602 --> 01:17:16.638
Go, Meghan, go!

1060
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.354
Sarah Murray!

1061
01:19:13.421 --> 01:19:14.822
Got your father on the phone.

1062
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:23.765
Sarah, Sarah, are you there?

1063
01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:27.368
I'm here, Daddy.

1064
01:19:31.106 --> 01:19:33.741
All right.
Thank God, thank God.

1065
01:19:33.808 --> 01:19:36.277
Are you hurt?
Are you okay?

1066
01:19:39.681 --> 01:19:41.150
I'm...

1067
01:19:41.215 --> 01:19:44.119
We're okay, we're okay.

1068
01:19:44.185 --> 01:19:45.553
All right, good.

1069
01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.722
Listen, now paramedics
are gonna be meeting you

1070
01:19:47.789 --> 01:19:50.425
at the docks, okay?

1071
01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:51.927
I know you're a tough cookie,

1072
01:19:51.994 --> 01:19:54.195
but they're gonna have
to check you over.

1073
01:19:54.262 --> 01:19:56.364
I'm catching
the red eye over tonight.

1074
01:19:56.431 --> 01:19:58.733
I'll be seeing you as soon
as I get there.

1075
01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.201
Okay.

1076
01:20:00.268 --> 01:20:03.304
Listen, you did good, honey,
just like I knew you would.

1077
01:20:03.371 --> 01:20:05.908
Your mom would be proud of you.

1078
01:20:09.044 --> 01:20:10.812
Dad?

1079
01:20:10.878 --> 01:20:11.980
Yeah?

1080
01:20:15.717 --> 01:20:16.818
When I get back,

1081
01:20:19.287 --> 01:20:21.389
I wanna
talk about Mom's studio.

1082
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.425
Okay, honey, okay.

1083
01:20:24.492 --> 01:20:27.361
I don't know. Maybe I could
pick up the brush again.

1084
01:20:30.598 --> 01:20:33.001
I think that could be good.

1085
01:20:33.068 --> 01:20:35.536
We'll go with whatever you want.

1086
01:20:35.603 --> 01:20:37.472
It's all right with me,
whatever you want.

1087
01:20:37.538 --> 01:20:40.341
You just let me know.

1088
01:20:40.408 --> 01:20:45.214
I love you, honey.

1089
01:20:45.279 --> 01:20:46.414
I love you, too, Dad.

1090
01:20:47.281 --> 01:20:48.516
I love you, too.

1091
01:20:49.383 --> 01:20:51.220
Can you still hear me?

1092
01:20:51.285 --> 01:20:52.453
Yes.

1093
01:20:55.224 --> 01:20:57.658
All right, honey.
Listen, I love you.

1094
01:20:57.725 --> 01:21:00.561
I love you very, very much,
more than you'll ever know.

1095
01:21:00.628 --> 01:21:03.531
Okay, I'm glad you're okay.

1096
01:21:04.967 --> 01:21:05.934
Goodbye.

1097
01:21:19.047 --> 01:21:20.314
Hey, Sarah?

1098
01:21:22.483 --> 01:21:28.389
If you ever ask me
to do your makeup again,

1099
01:21:28.456 --> 01:21:31.726
I'm gonna have to say no.

1100
01:21:33.861 --> 01:21:37.232
And it's nothing personal.

1101
01:21:37.298 --> 01:21:40.568
Like you're... you're great.

1102
01:21:40.635 --> 01:21:44.405
It's just I can never,

1103
01:21:44.472 --> 01:21:47.809
ever do this again.

1104
01:21:51.379 --> 01:21:52.680
Yeah, me neither.

1105
01:21:56.218 --> 01:21:59.121
You really like painting?

1106
01:21:59.188 --> 01:22:03.391
I think New Mexico would be
a great place for you.

1107
01:22:03.457 --> 01:22:05.693
Georgia O'Keefe
used to live there.

1108
01:22:08.663 --> 01:22:11.066
And, um,

1109
01:22:11.133 --> 01:22:16.737
she would sit there
and she would just paint.

1110
01:22:16.804 --> 01:22:18.739
And I think the moment
you'd get there,

1111
01:22:18.806 --> 01:22:20.943
you'd never ever want to leave.

1112
01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.951
And you know the best
part about New Mexico?

1113
01:22:31.886 --> 01:22:33.855
No.

1114
01:22:33.922 --> 01:22:35.823
No water!

1115
01:22:38.327 --> 01:22:40.963
No ocean!

1116
01:22:41.029 --> 01:22:42.130
No lakes!

1117
01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:45.466
It's just dry.

1118
01:22:47.535 --> 01:22:50.438
Sounds pretty good.

1119
01:22:51.439 --> 01:22:53.507
I'm in.

1120
01:22:56.044 --> 01:23:00.514
I am totally in.

1121
01:23:00.516 --> 01:23:05.516
