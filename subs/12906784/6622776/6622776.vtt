00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.965
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah, hey!

3
00:05:31.032 --> 00:05:33.801
I'm sorry to bother you.
I know you're busy all the time.

4
00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:35.836
Oh, I mean, it's not a bother.

5
00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:38.005
Listen, I was packin'
up all that stuff

6
00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:42.610
and I packed up all Mom's stuff
in the boxes and, uh...

7
00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:45.112
All the painting stuff
went with it, you know.

8
00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:46.714
Do you want it?

9
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.282
I don't paint, Dad.

10
00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:49.516
You really should
paint, you know.

11
00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:50.851
You got plenty of talent.

12
00:05:50.918 --> 00:05:52.519
I can't.
It just...

13
00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:54.521
It reminds me of her, okay?

14
00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:56.023
I mean, I understand that.

15
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.092
But if you ever do wanna
paint, you let me know

16
00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.728
because I think she'd like
you to have her stuff.

17
00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:02.129
I'll think about it.

18
00:06:02.196 --> 00:06:04.632
What is it you're
doing now, anyway?

19
00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.734
I'm about to go paddle out
and shoot some.

20
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:09.403
Who's going out there
with you, anyway?

21
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.570
Jason.

22
00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:12.539
Just you and Jason, huh?

23
00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:14.342
Actually, there's
a makeup artist with us.

24
00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:15.910
Her name's Meghan.

25
00:06:15.977 --> 00:06:17.178
Jason said they're
pretty good friends.

26
00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:20.648
Okay, nice and professional, eh?

27
00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:23.851
Where exactly are you gonna
go to take these photos?

28
00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:25.820
Just that same little spot.

29
00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.288
All right. Well, you
gotta make sure

30
00:06:27.355 --> 00:06:28.723
you're checkin'
the weather, right?

31
00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.224
Yeah, it's good.

32
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.560
I mean, we've been there
hundreds of times, so...

33
00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:35.763
Listen, I know you're
a water baby, but,

34
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.000
you know, it is the ocean.
Let's face it.

35
00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.669
It's a bay, Dad, and
if the weather gets bad,

36
00:06:41.736 --> 00:06:43.270
then we'll just turn
around and come back.

37
00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:45.973
It'll be fine, all right?

38
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.675
But I gotta go.
We're about to load up.

39
00:06:47.742 --> 00:06:50.144
All right.
Well, be careful.

40
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:52.146
Thanks.

41
00:06:52.213 --> 00:06:53.981
Listen, have fun, okay?

42
00:06:54.048 --> 00:06:56.050
Please remember I love you
and I miss you.

43
00:06:56.117 --> 00:06:57.284
Love you, too.

44
00:07:55.943 --> 00:07:58.379
Oh, this reminds me
when I was 12.

45
00:07:58.446 --> 00:07:59.579
You ate this when you were 12?

46
00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:00.748
You didn't?

47
00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:02.216
No. I had Slim Jims.

48
00:08:02.283 --> 00:08:04.318
Tried to find Slim Jims.
This is all they had.

49
00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:06.520
You know what's
in Slim Jims, right?

50
00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.155
No, not really.

51
00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:10.658
Have you ever heard
of Soylent Green?

52
00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:12.827
Yeah. Like the drink.

53
00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:14.995
You're losing points here!

54
00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:17.665
The 1973 classic
with Charlton Heston.

55
00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:19.467
Soylent Green is people!

56
00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:22.870
People? Okay.
That's why it tastes so good.

57
00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:23.904
You're gross.

58
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:25.406
You're grosser.

59
00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:26.640
Ugh.

60
00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:30.578
Sarah!
Meet Meghan.

61
00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:32.279
Meghan, meet Sarah.

62
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:36.183
Thanks for the introduction.
We actually met once before.

63
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.886
Our last photo exhibit,
you said something like

64
00:08:38.953 --> 00:08:40.855
our photos
look like paintings.

65
00:08:40.921 --> 00:08:44.592
Oh, yeah!
Painting with light!

66
00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:46.260
Wow, you have a great memory.

67
00:08:46.327 --> 00:08:47.828
Wouldn't forget it.

68
00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:50.197
Great. I didn't know you guys
had met before.

69
00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:52.199
There was a lot
of people at that show.

70
00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:54.802
Well, Meghan showed
me her portfolio.

71
00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:56.871
And her makeup work is awesome.

72
00:08:56.937 --> 00:08:59.140
Yeah. I actually checked
it out online.

73
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.908
Nice work.

74
00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:02.576
Great. All right.
We're all awesome then.

75
00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.044
Yeah!

76
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.713
Hey, listen, guys,
I know we planned on going

77
00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:08.349
back to that island
just past Cudjoe Basin.

78
00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:12.253
But I wanted to pitch
another option.

79
00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:13.420
You know that hurricane
that tore through

80
00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:14.688
the Keys last month?

81
00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:15.756
Well, it rearranged
all the channels

82
00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:17.791
leading into Florida Bay.

83
00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:19.660
I've been speaking to
some fishing buddies.

84
00:09:19.727 --> 00:09:21.362
They told me that a
submerged rock formation

85
00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:25.366
is now above water in the
channel, in the outer banks.

86
00:09:25.432 --> 00:09:28.903
I promise you the shots
will be sick.

87
00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:31.505
We'd be the first to capture it.

88
00:09:31.572 --> 00:09:33.807
They say it looks
like the Bahamas.

89
00:09:33.874 --> 00:09:35.442
It's just a little further out.

90
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:36.810
But if we leave now,

91
00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:38.512
we can be there
and back by nightfall.

92
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:40.247
How much further out?

93
00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:43.184
Well, it's just past Cuba,
so I guess that should be...

94
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.151
Shut up!

95
00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:45.686
No. I mean, where we're headed,

96
00:09:45.753 --> 00:09:48.355
I would say maybe another
hour beyond that.

97
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:49.557
So three hours?

98
00:09:49.624 --> 00:09:51.292
Yeah.

99
00:09:51.358 --> 00:09:53.561
How do you know if
it's still above water?

100
00:09:53.628 --> 00:09:55.362
Well, my buddies
were there two days ago.

101
00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:58.098
It's mostly underwater,
but with these peak tides

102
00:09:58.165 --> 00:10:00.267
we're having,
should be high and dry

103
00:10:00.334 --> 00:10:03.470
for at least two or
three hours during low tide.

104
00:10:03.537 --> 00:10:05.272
Wouldn't it be awesome
to be the first

105
00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.741
to capture an entirely
new island?

106
00:10:09.678 --> 00:10:11.512
I'm in.

107
00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:13.347
Yeah? Good.

108
00:10:13.414 --> 00:10:14.481
Me too.

109
00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:16.817
Great! Great!
Okay!

110
00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:18.519
Hey! Phone!
Want it in the dry bag?

111
00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:21.488
I'm probably just gonna
hang on to it, but thank you.

112
00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:26.160
Well, these are the things
that cannot get wet.

113
00:10:26.227 --> 00:10:29.263
I thought you said your
makeup was waterproof.

114
00:10:30.564 --> 00:10:32.299
Well, it is, but my kit's not.

115
00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:34.802
Okay. All right, guys,
let's hit the water.

116
00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.937
We gotta make our window.
Let's go.

117
00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:06.701
Ladies...

118
00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:07.935
I call blue!

119
00:11:08.002 --> 00:11:10.104
Oh, you got
the pretty one.

120
00:11:15.776 --> 00:11:17.211
I got you.

121
00:11:18.145 --> 00:11:21.382
Nice, all right.
Take your time.

122
00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:23.384
Good?

123
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.953
Nice. Balance.

124
00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:30.057
Okay.

125
00:11:35.396 --> 00:11:37.064
We're good to go!

126
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.511
All right, ladies.

127
00:12:57.578 --> 00:13:00.381
Tide cycles are at peak
highs and peak lows.

128
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:03.183
We gotta get in,
get what we need, get out,

129
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.285
before it goes back underwater.

130
00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:08.222
Fortunately, with a
photographer like myself

131
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:12.126
and a stellar
makeup artist like you,

132
00:13:12.192 --> 00:13:14.328
a couple of hours will
be more than enough.

133
00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:17.498
Forgetting someone?

134
00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:21.068
Oh, yeah, our subject.

135
00:13:21.135 --> 00:13:22.837
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:13:22.903 --> 00:13:25.305
She's all right, but you know,
with all that natural beauty

137
00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:28.509
in the environment,
the model doesn't matter much.

138
00:13:30.577 --> 00:13:32.647
You're gonna shoot me
in silhouette, right?

139
00:13:32.714 --> 00:13:34.381
Silhouette? Yeah.

140
00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:35.983
Actually, the whole thing's
not gonna even be in focus.

141
00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:37.685
That sounds about right.

142
00:13:37.752 --> 00:13:38.787
Ouch!

143
00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:42.055
Guess you don't need
a makeup artist anyway.

144
00:13:42.122 --> 00:13:44.692
Oh, no, no.
We definitely need you.

145
00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:47.995
Even in silhouette, she's gonna
need as much makeup as possible.

146
00:13:49.463 --> 00:13:51.098
Okay...

147
00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:53.167
Okay, okay, all right!

148
00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:55.068
All right!
Enough fun.

149
00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:56.403
Jeez, we gotta get there!

150
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.539
Keep paddling, ladies,
keep paddling.

151
00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.140
Beep, beep.

152
00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:37.912
Hey, Sarah.

153
00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:39.781
I saw you on your phone earlier.

154
00:14:39.848 --> 00:14:42.149
- Was that your dad?
- Yeah.

155
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.350
How's he doin'?

156
00:14:44.985 --> 00:14:46.253
Okay, I guess.

157
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.689
Definitely not
used to being alone.

158
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:51.592
Yeah.
Yeah, I get it.

159
00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:56.631
My mom passed away about
a year ago.

160
00:14:56.698 --> 00:14:59.099
But we knew it was coming,
so we were prepared.

161
00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:03.203
I mean, as well
as anyone can be.

162
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.442
I'm so sorry.

163
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:10.110
Thanks.

164
00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:12.647
It's not easy.
She was...

165
00:15:12.714 --> 00:15:16.550
She was one of a kind,
just like her daughter.

166
00:15:16.618 --> 00:15:17.619
An artist, right?

167
00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:22.322
Her dad is a bush pilot,
flew all over the world,

168
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:24.792
was delivering medicine
in Botswana.

169
00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:26.093
He was in the Air Force.

170
00:15:26.159 --> 00:15:28.630
Not the Air Force.

171
00:15:28.696 --> 00:15:30.632
What was it then?

172
00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:32.000
Civil Air Patrol.

173
00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:33.601
Yeah, that's part
of the Air Force.

174
00:15:33.668 --> 00:15:37.037
No, it's different.
They're volunteers.

175
00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:39.406
Right, volunteer.
So he's a super hero.

176
00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:43.544
Did he ask about me?

177
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:44.646
Actually, he did.

178
00:15:45.813 --> 00:15:47.548
Yes! See?
Super hero.

179
00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:42.770
Whoa!

180
00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:44.104
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

181
00:16:49.777 --> 00:16:50.745
Those are dolphins!

182
00:16:50.812 --> 00:16:52.145
Check it out.

183
00:16:56.784 --> 00:16:58.686
Wow!

184
00:16:58.753 --> 00:17:01.588
I've never been this close
to dolphins before.

185
00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:15.202
Whoa!

186
00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:16.403
Dude, look at that!

187
00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:19.339
That dolphin is really beat up.

188
00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:24.144
What do you think did that?

189
00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:25.613
Maybe a boat?

190
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.447
No, no, no.
These are bottlenose.

191
00:17:27.514 --> 00:17:29.684
I mean, they're
the bad boys of the ocean.

192
00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:33.821
Who knows who
they're hustling with.

193
00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:37.591
It looks like bite marks.

194
00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:38.626
Yeah.

195
00:18:06.688 --> 00:18:09.791
We're making good time, ladies.
Let's take five.

196
00:18:09.857 --> 00:18:10.792
Please...

197
00:18:13.027 --> 00:18:15.830
How much further, you think?

198
00:18:15.897 --> 00:18:17.932
Say around two hours.

199
00:18:17.999 --> 00:18:20.333
See, this is the time
I think I would have loved

200
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.202
to pitch in to a motorboat.

201
00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:25.773
Okay, planet killer, right?

202
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.776
Look, I mean, this can be
pretty dodgy around here,

203
00:18:28.843 --> 00:18:30.477
especially if you don't
know the area.

204
00:18:30.544 --> 00:18:32.780
I mean, you got reefs,
oysters bars.

205
00:18:32.847 --> 00:18:34.148
You gotta be careful.

206
00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:35.883
Yeah. Honestly, even
the Coast Guard takes it easy

207
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.618
in the back water.

208
00:18:37.685 --> 00:18:40.487
Didn't you say you were a
monster with a paddle?

209
00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:45.660
Yeah... not this kind
of paddle.

210
00:18:46.728 --> 00:18:49.296
Okay.

211
00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:51.364
What? Live a little.

212
00:19:20.027 --> 00:19:21.696
So this is our usual spot,

213
00:19:21.763 --> 00:19:23.497
but the rock formation we're
gonna be shooting at today

214
00:19:23.563 --> 00:19:27.334
is just a little bit further
south towards the reef.

215
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.870
Gonna be worth that extra mile.

216
00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:32.874
Um, will you put this
in your dry bag, please?

217
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.042
Certainly.

218
00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:37.377
Glad to see you've come around.

219
00:19:37.444 --> 00:19:38.913
Behave.

220
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.648
What?

221
00:19:45.418 --> 00:19:46.553
All right, guys.

222
00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.489
Almost there.

223
00:19:55.428 --> 00:19:57.698
And here we are!

224
00:19:57.765 --> 00:20:01.068
Look at this place!
Doesn't this look great?

225
00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:02.435
I don't know.

226
00:20:02.502 --> 00:20:04.272
Looks like a cement block
with barnacles.

227
00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:07.307
We're not goin' for pretty.
We're going for unique.

228
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.776
The shots are gonna be awesome.

229
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.964
Woo!

230
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.397
Whoa.

231
00:21:05.266 --> 00:21:07.134
Wow.

232
00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:08.135
All right!

233
00:21:10.503 --> 00:21:11.739
What do we think?

234
00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:12.807
Wow!

235
00:21:12.874 --> 00:21:14.642
It's definitely not the Bahamas,

236
00:21:14.709 --> 00:21:16.844
but I feel we can probably
make it work.

237
00:21:16.911 --> 00:21:18.946
Okay? Right.
That's what we wanna hear!

238
00:21:19.013 --> 00:21:20.380
All right, let's get this
show on the road!

239
00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:21.816
Yeah.

240
00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:24.719
Let me get the camera.
You guys do makeup.

241
00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:26.988
- Will you get my wrap?
- Yeah.

242
00:21:27.054 --> 00:21:28.155
Sit right there?

243
00:21:28.222 --> 00:21:29.757
Yeah, perfect.

244
00:21:29.824 --> 00:21:31.491
Okay.

245
00:21:33.694 --> 00:21:36.063
What are you thinking?

246
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.598
I'm thinking let's keep
with the natural look.

247
00:21:38.666 --> 00:21:39.934
- I like it.
- Okay.

248
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:41.769
You have a natural
beauty about you.

249
00:21:41.836 --> 00:21:42.737
Thank you.

250
00:21:42.803 --> 00:21:43.871
- Yeah, you, too.
- Thank you!

251
00:21:43.938 --> 00:21:46.040
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's see.

252
00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:49.176
Do you want to fry it
or do you wanna...

253
00:21:49.243 --> 00:21:50.678
I like it a little wet.

254
00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:00.520
Perfect!

255
00:22:02.356 --> 00:22:04.959
What do you think?

256
00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:06.727
Yeah, it's nice.

257
00:22:06.794 --> 00:22:09.230
Damn, a beautiful mermaid!

258
00:22:09.297 --> 00:22:10.898
I'm serious!

259
00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:12.900
And then with the wrap
on your waist, it'll be perfect.

260
00:22:12.967 --> 00:22:14.669
Yeah, I dig it.

261
00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:17.605
All right, let's do some shoots.

262
00:22:18.639 --> 00:22:20.540
All right, nice!

263
00:22:24.412 --> 00:22:26.280
Yeah, that's it.

264
00:22:26.347 --> 00:22:27.748
Get that light.

265
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:32.519
Nice, let's do it. Can you
turn a little bit that way?

266
00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:34.121
Yeah, that's it.

267
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.228
Ha-ha.

268
00:22:41.295 --> 00:22:42.229
All right, hold on a sec!

269
00:22:45.266 --> 00:22:48.568
I wasn't expecting you
to invite me out here.

270
00:22:48.636 --> 00:22:50.271
Well, why not?

271
00:22:50.338 --> 00:22:52.006
You're awesome.

272
00:22:52.073 --> 00:22:53.975
Thank you.

273
00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:57.178
I know, it's just the whole...
Sarah thing.

274
00:22:57.244 --> 00:23:01.581
No, look. Sarah and
I are friends, good friends.

275
00:23:03.284 --> 00:23:05.286
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

276
00:23:05.353 --> 00:23:06.519
It's not like that.

277
00:23:09.123 --> 00:23:10.891
I just don't want to get
in between anything...

278
00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.927
There's nothing there,
not anymore.

279
00:23:12.994 --> 00:23:17.530
Look, Sarah and I, we were
together for a while.

280
00:23:17.597 --> 00:23:22.770
And it was special, but it's not
special in the way you think.

281
00:23:25.439 --> 00:23:28.575
I care about Sarah and her
family means the world to me.

282
00:23:28.642 --> 00:23:31.612
I admire her... and her dad.

283
00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:36.017
I was with them when
her mom had her illness.

284
00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:38.585
You know, it almost
broke their family.

285
00:23:38.652 --> 00:23:42.289
I'm really happy
that you came, okay?

286
00:23:42.356 --> 00:23:44.959
Yeah, I'm so happy to be here.
I just want...

287
00:23:45.026 --> 00:23:46.794
I just want to make sure
you can do what you want

288
00:23:46.861 --> 00:23:47.862
and you're cool with it.

289
00:23:47.928 --> 00:23:49.596
You know what I wanna do?

290
00:23:49.663 --> 00:23:50.931
I would love for
us three to make

291
00:23:50.998 --> 00:23:52.599
some really cool art together.

292
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:55.703
Me, too.

293
00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:03.611
I actually have that
same one at home.

294
00:24:03.677 --> 00:24:05.212
No kidding? Right?

295
00:24:10.084 --> 00:24:13.054
Check this one out.
The lighting is so dope!

296
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.424
You wanna get down a little bit?
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

297
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.959
I'll grab the GoPro.
Do you mind holding this?

298
00:24:19.026 --> 00:24:20.628
- I don't mind at all.
- Thank you.

299
00:24:22.696 --> 00:24:24.732
Okay.

300
00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:27.601
You're right, yeah.
That's gonna be good!

301
00:24:31.405 --> 00:24:32.773
Looking good!

302
00:24:37.244 --> 00:24:38.813
She's nice.

303
00:24:38.879 --> 00:24:41.449
Meghan? Yeah, she's cool.

304
00:24:41.515 --> 00:24:44.318
I, uh, I don't know much
about her makeup credentials.

305
00:24:44.385 --> 00:24:45.686
But I can definitely see

306
00:24:45.753 --> 00:24:47.421
why you'd want
to bring her along.

307
00:24:47.488 --> 00:24:49.223
You guys seem like you're
getting along real well.

308
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.491
Yeah, she's cool.

309
00:24:50.558 --> 00:24:52.660
We hung out after
the last gallery.

310
00:24:52.726 --> 00:24:54.462
You left early.

311
00:24:54.528 --> 00:24:58.766
Yeah, I honestly think she'd be
a really good pick for you.

312
00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:00.734
We're, uh, we're
doin' matchmaker now?

313
00:25:00.801 --> 00:25:02.403
That's an interesting switch.

314
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.438
No, I'm not playing matchmaker.

315
00:25:04.505 --> 00:25:05.706
I'm just making an observation.

316
00:25:05.773 --> 00:25:07.208
An observation, okay.

317
00:25:07.274 --> 00:25:10.478
Well, what do you see now?
What do you observe?

318
00:25:10.544 --> 00:25:14.782
I observe that we should
probably just keep shooting.

319
00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:17.985
Sarah?

320
00:25:18.052 --> 00:25:19.353
What?

321
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.155
All I'm saying is that...

322
00:25:21.222 --> 00:25:25.326
if you ever did decide to move
on, I would be happy for you.

323
00:25:25.392 --> 00:25:26.794
Yeah.

324
00:25:28.295 --> 00:25:30.531
All right. Are we good?

325
00:25:30.598 --> 00:25:32.900
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

326
00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:35.436
- Underwater shots?
- Yeah, sure.

327
00:25:35.503 --> 00:25:37.104
Go for it.

328
00:25:41.242 --> 00:25:42.243
Me first?

329
00:25:44.478 --> 00:25:45.913
Woo!

330
00:25:54.555 --> 00:25:55.789
All right, I got you!

331
00:25:59.628 --> 00:26:01.262
Ready?

332
00:26:01.328 --> 00:26:02.263
- Woo!
- Woo!

333
00:26:20.414 --> 00:26:21.749
Jason.

334
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:26.621
Go back up, all right?

335
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.123
Okay, wait 'til I get
low and swim down to me, yeah?

336
00:27:04.725 --> 00:27:05.859
Oh, my God.

337
00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:08.996
Shark!

338
00:27:12.399 --> 00:27:14.902
Sarah! Jason!

339
00:27:14.969 --> 00:27:17.438
Get out of the water!
There's a shark!

340
00:27:17.504 --> 00:27:19.106
There's a shark!

341
00:27:21.408 --> 00:27:27.514
- Jason!
- Sarah, get to shore!

342
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.427
Ah!

343
00:27:41.696 --> 00:27:43.130
Jason!

344
00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:46.934
Jason!

345
00:27:54.743 --> 00:27:56.410
Jason!

346
00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:22.369
What are we gonna do?

347
00:28:22.436 --> 00:28:24.305
It's right there!
I don't know!

348
00:28:47.828 --> 00:28:49.997
What do we do?
What do we do?

349
00:28:50.064 --> 00:28:51.532
What do we do?
What do we do?

350
00:28:51.598 --> 00:28:54.368
What do we do?
I've never been through this!

351
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.138
My phone, my phone,
my phone, my phone.

352
00:29:00.608 --> 00:29:02.476
My phone's in here.

353
00:29:02.543 --> 00:29:03.544
Just, uh...

354
00:29:07.014 --> 00:29:09.316
My phone's dead.
My phone's dead!

355
00:29:09.383 --> 00:29:12.553
Just get your phone!
Is it working?

356
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.887
No signal!

357
00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:15.289
Go find a signal
and call 911, please.

358
00:29:15.356 --> 00:29:16.624
Just call 911.

359
00:29:16.691 --> 00:29:18.459
I'm not calling 911.
I'm calling my dad.

360
00:29:18.525 --> 00:29:20.527
No, no, no, no!

361
00:29:20.594 --> 00:29:22.096
Please just call 911!

362
00:29:22.162 --> 00:29:23.931
My battery is almost dead,
all right?

363
00:29:23.997 --> 00:29:25.499
I only have time
to make one call.

364
00:29:25.566 --> 00:29:27.769
Why would your dad be
the one to call?

365
00:29:27.836 --> 00:29:29.470
He will figure it out!

366
00:29:29.536 --> 00:29:31.840
If there's anybody that
can do this, it's him!

367
00:29:31.905 --> 00:29:36.110
But my battery is dying and I
still don't have a signal, okay?

368
00:29:36.176 --> 00:29:38.178
Your dad doesn't
know we're here!

369
00:29:38.245 --> 00:29:40.648
We changed our plans, remember?

370
00:29:40.715 --> 00:29:43.718
He will figure it out, okay?

371
00:29:43.785 --> 00:29:46.320
I need you to trust me!

372
00:29:46.387 --> 00:29:48.021
You're supposed to call 911.

373
00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:49.456
You're not supposed
to call your daddy.

374
00:29:49.523 --> 00:29:53.293
Okay, we call 911,
911 calls the Coast Guard.

375
00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.830
They call the Navy and
they call Civil Air Patrol!

376
00:29:55.896 --> 00:29:58.232
Either way, it ends up on
his desk for Search and Rescue!

377
00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:00.602
So I need you to trust me.

378
00:30:00.668 --> 00:30:04.037
Because I just got a signal
and I'm calling my dad!

379
00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:08.242
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

380
00:30:17.752 --> 00:30:19.586
Oh, God.

381
00:30:22.724 --> 00:30:23.924
Yes, hello?

382
00:30:23.991 --> 00:30:25.092
Dad, dad, dad, listen!
It's me!

383
00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:26.828
Dad, I don't have a lot of time,

384
00:30:26.895 --> 00:30:29.898
but we're stranded where
we're on this rock formation.

385
00:30:29.963 --> 00:30:32.566
And we didn't go to the island
that we normally go to.

386
00:30:32.634 --> 00:30:36.604
We're like an hour
off of Cudjoe Key!

387
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:38.071
Dad, Jason died.

388
00:30:38.138 --> 00:30:39.607
It was a shark.

389
00:30:39.674 --> 00:30:41.175
Wait a second!

390
00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:42.811
Jason's dead?

391
00:30:42.877 --> 00:30:44.344
Yes!

392
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:46.580
This thing is circling
and the tide's coming in.

393
00:30:46.648 --> 00:30:48.415
We're not safe here.

394
00:30:48.482 --> 00:30:49.550
Are you okay?

395
00:30:49.617 --> 00:30:51.318
We're here!
We're on land!

396
00:30:51.385 --> 00:30:53.187
Dad, the tide's rising a
lot faster than I thought!

397
00:30:53.253 --> 00:30:56.089
I think we have
like 45 minutes.

398
00:30:56.156 --> 00:30:57.991
I have that long and
this phone's gonna die!

399
00:30:58.058 --> 00:31:00.461
I just need you to tell me
that you're gonna find us!

400
00:31:00.527 --> 00:31:02.196
Honey, listen.
You're doin' good.

401
00:31:02.262 --> 00:31:04.164
I'll get on with
Civil Air Patrol.

402
00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:08.068
Telephone Forensics Team
can get a bead on your location.

403
00:31:08.135 --> 00:31:11.371
Stay where you are
as long as you can.

404
00:31:11.438 --> 00:31:14.274
Yeah, we'll stay here, but,
Dad, the water's rising.

405
00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:16.644
The tide's coming in so much
faster than we thought.

406
00:31:16.711 --> 00:31:19.313
Okay, and are there
any other islands around?

407
00:31:19.379 --> 00:31:20.547
Is there anyplace else
you can go?

408
00:31:20.615 --> 00:31:23.150
Yes! I saw one on
the way in here.

409
00:31:23.217 --> 00:31:24.619
I don't know where it is,
but I can find it.

410
00:31:24.686 --> 00:31:27.689
Listen, just stay there
as long as you can.

411
00:31:31.826 --> 00:31:34.127
It's coming... It's coming back!
The shark!

412
00:31:34.194 --> 00:31:35.262
What was that?
Are you okay?

413
00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:36.798
We're fine, we're fine!

414
00:31:36.865 --> 00:31:40.835
Just please promise me
you'll find us, okay?

415
00:31:43.671 --> 00:31:45.607
Honey! Honey!

416
00:31:45.673 --> 00:31:47.140
Dad!

417
00:32:11.966 --> 00:32:13.500
It's something.

418
00:32:28.016 --> 00:32:29.684
Listen, yes, I've tried.

419
00:32:29.751 --> 00:32:32.152
I tried to get her back, but
it goes straight to voicemail.

420
00:32:34.454 --> 00:32:37.391
Do you have enough data
to pinpoint her location?

421
00:32:37.457 --> 00:32:40.728
Cellphone forensics is
analyzing the pings

422
00:32:40.795 --> 00:32:43.865
from their phones provided
by the cellphone carrier.

423
00:32:43.932 --> 00:32:48.468
As you were saying, it appears
the phones are off now.

424
00:32:48.535 --> 00:32:50.504
With the limited data
we do have,

425
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:52.674
I can't get exact
GPS coordinates.

426
00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.976
But by tracking
the direction of the pings

427
00:32:55.043 --> 00:32:56.611
when the phones were on,

428
00:32:56.678 --> 00:32:58.846
it appears you're right
from what you were saying.

429
00:32:58.913 --> 00:33:00.715
It seems to be they're
traveling towards

430
00:33:00.782 --> 00:33:03.083
the outer islands
of the Florida Bay,

431
00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.719
the Cudjoe Basin.

432
00:33:04.786 --> 00:33:07.254
Right. So it looks like
they were heading

433
00:33:07.321 --> 00:33:09.691
to those outer islands that
I was telling you about.

434
00:33:09.757 --> 00:33:13.393
All the initial pings line up
heading to those islands,

435
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.429
except the last one
which was a little off,

436
00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:16.898
which could be an anomaly.

437
00:33:16.965 --> 00:33:18.432
With only one local tower,

438
00:33:18.498 --> 00:33:20.735
it's hard to get an
exact GPS location.

439
00:33:20.802 --> 00:33:25.505
How confident are you of the
accuracy of the cellphone data?

440
00:33:25.572 --> 00:33:28.009
Unfortunately, the cellphone
forensics team

441
00:33:28.076 --> 00:33:30.878
won't be able to pinpoint
their exact location.

442
00:33:30.945 --> 00:33:33.513
With only one local
tower in that area,

443
00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.382
it's more of a wilderness area.

444
00:33:35.449 --> 00:33:37.384
If there were
three local towers,

445
00:33:37.451 --> 00:33:39.687
we would be able to
triangulate their location.

446
00:33:39.754 --> 00:33:42.222
We are basing it on
what we have

447
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:44.659
and what you told us
about their destination.

448
00:33:44.726 --> 00:33:45.960
Okay, got it.

449
00:33:46.027 --> 00:33:48.228
The other issue is because
of the single tower,

450
00:33:48.295 --> 00:33:49.697
reception becomes an issue.

451
00:33:49.764 --> 00:33:52.599
There's no full coverage
in that basin.

452
00:33:52.667 --> 00:33:55.569
If they venture in
an area without reception,

453
00:33:55.637 --> 00:33:58.538
even our limited tracking
is impossible.

454
00:33:58.606 --> 00:34:02.376
What is the ETA on getting
a decision on who's available?

455
00:34:02.442 --> 00:34:04.912
I'll have an answer
by 0300 hours.

456
00:34:04.979 --> 00:34:07.447
It's got to be faster than that!

457
00:34:07.514 --> 00:34:10.118
That area is affected
by tidal flow.

458
00:34:10.183 --> 00:34:12.552
I hear what you're saying.
We'll have an answer pronto.

459
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.589
And I will get eyes in
the sky as soon as possible.

460
00:34:15.657 --> 00:34:17.224
Okay.

461
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.726
Then I'll call her back soon.

462
00:34:18.793 --> 00:34:21.629
Now let me know if
the cellphone forensics team

463
00:34:21.696 --> 00:34:25.800
can get a better idea
on their location, okay? Thanks.

464
00:34:25.867 --> 00:34:28.268
We'll do our best to
find her, James.

465
00:34:28.335 --> 00:34:30.370
I'll be in touch.

466
00:34:40.014 --> 00:34:41.448
Hey, it's Sarah.

467
00:34:41.515 --> 00:34:43.450
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

468
00:34:44.686 --> 00:34:47.421
Honey, I guess
you're phone is off.

469
00:34:47.487 --> 00:34:51.059
I got you through
Civil Air Patrol.

470
00:34:51.125 --> 00:34:53.861
We're working on trying to
get a lock on your location.

471
00:34:53.928 --> 00:34:56.496
It won't be exact,
but close enough

472
00:34:56.563 --> 00:34:58.132
to narrow down the search.

473
00:34:58.198 --> 00:35:02.003
They're gonna send up
a spotter plane within one hour.

474
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.370
I hope you're all right.

475
00:35:03.437 --> 00:35:05.907
Don't worry.
Help is on the way.

476
00:35:05.973 --> 00:35:07.175
So call me.

477
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.542
I love you.

478
00:35:16.516 --> 00:35:19.120
Tides are coming in fast again.

479
00:35:19.187 --> 00:35:20.353
I noticed.

480
00:35:28.562 --> 00:35:30.297
What are we gonna do?

481
00:35:31.899 --> 00:35:33.634
Look for higher ground.

482
00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:35.469
I'm not getting back
in that water.

483
00:35:35.535 --> 00:35:36.971
I'm not.
I'm not doing it.

484
00:35:37.038 --> 00:35:40.574
Look, where we stand,
will soon be underwater

485
00:35:40.641 --> 00:35:42.777
and we won't have a choice.

486
00:35:42.844 --> 00:35:46.647
Maybe we just stay here,
someone will find us!

487
00:35:46.714 --> 00:35:49.050
And we won't have to get back
in the water with the shark.

488
00:35:49.117 --> 00:35:51.686
That'd be great, but we
can't argue with the reality

489
00:35:51.753 --> 00:35:53.487
of the situation
we're in right now,

490
00:35:53.553 --> 00:35:57.524
which is that this island
is going under fast.

491
00:35:57.591 --> 00:36:00.393
So we do need to act
and we need to act now.

492
00:36:11.471 --> 00:36:13.975
Sarah, the kayaks!

493
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:15.143
Shit!

494
00:36:15.209 --> 00:36:16.443
What?

495
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.411
- Come on!
- Oh, come on!

496
00:37:06.294 --> 00:37:09.197
It's right there, it's right
there, it's right there!

497
00:37:09.263 --> 00:37:13.466
Meghan, put your paddle
in the water and let's go!

498
00:37:13.533 --> 00:37:15.603
Okay, okay, okay!

499
00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:42.763
Come on, Meg.
I need you to keep the pace up!

500
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.232
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

501
00:37:44.298 --> 00:37:45.800
Right there.

502
00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:47.969
Dry land, it's right there.

503
00:37:51.973 --> 00:37:53.373
Meghan, are you with me?

504
00:37:57.078 --> 00:37:58.279
Oh, God.
It's back

505
00:37:58.346 --> 00:38:00.147
- It's back.
- Where?

506
00:38:00.214 --> 00:38:01.849
It's right there.

507
00:38:07.255 --> 00:38:09.090
Let's go!

508
00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:26.307
What is that?

509
00:38:26.374 --> 00:38:27.875
Oh my God, it's sharks.

510
00:38:27.942 --> 00:38:29.710
It's sharks, it's sharks,
it's sharks!

511
00:38:31.379 --> 00:38:33.748
Come on!
Come on!

512
00:38:33.814 --> 00:38:34.916
Move!

513
00:38:42.555 --> 00:38:44.058
Dolphins.

514
00:39:05.212 --> 00:39:07.348
Come on! This is our window!
Let's go!

515
00:39:07.415 --> 00:39:08.649
Okay!

516
00:39:12.186 --> 00:39:13.654
Meghan, let's go!

517
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:15.555
Where do we go?
Where do we go? Where do we go?

518
00:39:15.623 --> 00:39:16.791
Right in front of us!

519
00:39:18.059 --> 00:39:18.793
I don't know!

520
00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:20.795
Meghan, don't stop!

521
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:22.595
It's coming this way.

522
00:39:27.335 --> 00:39:29.737
Come on. You got this.
Keep up with me, Meg!

523
00:39:31.339 --> 00:39:33.975
That's the land right there.
We can make it.

524
00:39:37.611 --> 00:39:40.247
I gotta take a break,
I gotta take a break.

525
00:39:41.782 --> 00:39:43.317
We gotta keep goin'!

526
00:39:43.384 --> 00:39:44.719
Please, I just need a minute.

527
00:39:44.785 --> 00:39:46.153
Sarah, please, just one minute.

528
00:39:54.561 --> 00:39:56.630
I didn't sign up
for this survival B.S.

529
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.236
Neither did I.

530
00:40:02.303 --> 00:40:03.771
Why couldn't he
have done this shoot

531
00:40:03.838 --> 00:40:07.842
on like a beach with
big palm trees?

532
00:40:09.343 --> 00:40:12.512
You know, originally, we talked
about doing this in a pool.

533
00:40:13.546 --> 00:40:15.282
Are you kidding me?

534
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:16.851
What happened?

535
00:40:19.053 --> 00:40:22.623
You know Jason.
He always had to push the limit.

536
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:27.428
Well, after this, I am no
longer pushing my limits.

537
00:40:27.495 --> 00:40:30.131
I'm only working on dry land

538
00:40:30.197 --> 00:40:33.467
and preferably close
to a place where

539
00:40:33.533 --> 00:40:35.703
I can get a drink.

540
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:37.171
Sure I can't interest you
in a three-week

541
00:40:37.238 --> 00:40:39.173
editorial shoot through
polar bear country?

542
00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.975
That was next up on
our to-do list.

543
00:40:42.676 --> 00:40:44.779
Hey, do you mind handing me
that knife?

544
00:40:44.845 --> 00:40:47.348
I'll cut both
of our wrists.

545
00:40:52.019 --> 00:40:54.055
Okay.
You ready to get to moving?

546
00:40:55.389 --> 00:40:56.824
Yeah.

547
00:41:16.644 --> 00:41:18.012
That's it, Meg.

548
00:41:21.182 --> 00:41:22.550
Sarah... Sarah?

549
00:41:22.616 --> 00:41:25.086
It's a shark! It's a shark!
It's a shark!

550
00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:46.640
It's a dolphin.

551
00:41:46.707 --> 00:41:48.209
What?
Are you sure?

552
00:41:54.081 --> 00:41:56.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no, that's a shark.

553
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.752
That's a shark!

554
00:42:02.356 --> 00:42:03.691
Shark!

555
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:08.796
Paddle!

556
00:42:10.164 --> 00:42:11.732
Oh, no, oh, no!

557
00:42:15.469 --> 00:42:17.171
Sarah, wait!

558
00:42:17.238 --> 00:42:18.472
What?

559
00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:20.141
Listen to me, please!

560
00:42:20.207 --> 00:42:22.042
What?

561
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:25.179
Sharks are attracted to
vibrations, right?

562
00:42:25.246 --> 00:42:27.314
Maybe they're attracted
to our paddling.

563
00:42:27.381 --> 00:42:31.352
So maybe if we stand still,
they won't find us.

564
00:42:33.988 --> 00:42:36.023
Dude, we can make it.

565
00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.959
You know what?
I'm not going to make it!

566
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.935
I'll stay with you.

567
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.438
Okay, I'll stay with you.

568
00:43:01.182 --> 00:43:03.284
Okay, hold there.

569
00:43:05.586 --> 00:43:07.688
If we tie our kayaks together,

570
00:43:07.755 --> 00:43:10.324
we can make one shape
in the water.

571
00:43:10.391 --> 00:43:11.926
It'll make us look bigger,
not like something

572
00:43:11.992 --> 00:43:13.928
that that thing
can eat, okay?

573
00:43:13.994 --> 00:43:16.797
I'm gonna hold on to this.

574
00:43:16.864 --> 00:43:18.399
Catch this.

575
00:43:24.104 --> 00:43:25.973
This will hopefully buy us
enough time to rest

576
00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.075
and then we can just
make it to that island.

577
00:43:33.648 --> 00:43:35.082
Okay, pull your paddle in.

578
00:43:57.404 --> 00:43:59.373
Where is it?

579
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.242
Shh! Be quiet.

580
00:44:11.418 --> 00:44:13.754
Sarah? Sarah?

581
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.124
We're fine.

582
00:44:58.032 --> 00:45:00.067
Did you see its eyes roll back?

583
00:45:00.134 --> 00:45:02.202
What does that mean?

584
00:45:02.269 --> 00:45:04.305
When it bites into
something it can't see.

585
00:45:09.644 --> 00:45:11.746
Is it still right here?

586
00:45:11.812 --> 00:45:13.080
I don't know.

587
00:45:25.492 --> 00:45:27.895
Hey, are you girls okay?

588
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:29.463
Get out! Get out!

589
00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:31.498
Meghan! Meghan!

590
00:45:34.636 --> 00:45:36.270
Do you need any help?

591
00:46:09.838 --> 00:46:11.472
Come on, come on!

592
00:46:11.538 --> 00:46:13.006
We gotta get over there.

593
00:46:13.073 --> 00:46:14.174
He's dead, Sarah.

594
00:46:14.241 --> 00:46:16.477
Sarah, stop.
Sarah, stop!

595
00:46:16.543 --> 00:46:17.645
He's dead!

596
00:46:17.712 --> 00:46:19.681
Sarah, listen to me!

597
00:46:19.748 --> 00:46:20.749
The man's dead!

598
00:46:20.815 --> 00:46:22.182
We can get over there.

599
00:46:22.249 --> 00:46:23.417
The man's dead!

600
00:46:23.484 --> 00:46:25.052
We can reach that!
We can get...

601
00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:27.789
Sarah, you're not thinking!

602
00:46:27.856 --> 00:46:31.291
The lanyard fell
down with him!

603
00:46:31.358 --> 00:46:33.293
It's a Sea-Doo, okay?

604
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.496
So even if we got
to the jet ski,

605
00:46:35.562 --> 00:46:37.598
the lanyard still fell down
with the rider!

606
00:46:37.665 --> 00:46:41.502
So it's not going to start!
Do you got it?

607
00:46:46.608 --> 00:46:48.442
Come on, we gotta go!

608
00:46:50.944 --> 00:46:52.212
Come on.

609
00:46:52.279 --> 00:46:55.115
- Please, just help me!
- Okay! Okay.

610
00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:30.718
Sarah!

611
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.724
Look! Look!
There's a sandbar!

612
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:39.059
We can make it!
Come on!

613
00:48:07.956 --> 00:48:10.123
What do you want?

614
00:48:17.564 --> 00:48:21.435
Sarah, this is me calling
in to check with you!

615
00:48:21.502 --> 00:48:23.771
I hope you're hangin' in tight.

616
00:48:23.838 --> 00:48:26.741
Air Patrol has a decent lock
on your position there.

617
00:48:26.808 --> 00:48:29.409
It's a ballpark estimate
because they don't have

618
00:48:29.476 --> 00:48:33.781
enough cell towers out there
to triangulate your location.

619
00:48:33.848 --> 00:48:35.249
But once they get in the air,

620
00:48:35.315 --> 00:48:37.652
they should be able
to pick you out.

621
00:48:37.719 --> 00:48:39.988
We're checkin' on the
outer islands, okay?

622
00:48:40.053 --> 00:48:41.689
So call me back.

623
00:48:41.756 --> 00:48:44.291
Call me back, honey,
call me back.

624
00:49:05.813 --> 00:49:07.247
Hey, it's Sarah.

625
00:49:07.314 --> 00:49:08.917
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

626
00:49:08.983 --> 00:49:11.853
Sarah, honey, listen.
I hope you're safe.

627
00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.389
I wanted to let you know that
the helicopter is up in the air.

628
00:49:15.455 --> 00:49:19.326
Marine Patrol is synching
with the Coast Guard.

629
00:49:19.393 --> 00:49:21.930
All hands are on deck
to get you home.

630
00:49:21.996 --> 00:49:24.331
I wanted to give
you some good news.

631
00:49:24.398 --> 00:49:26.466
Right now, where
you're at is experiencing

632
00:49:26.533 --> 00:49:28.569
what they call the king tides.

633
00:49:28.636 --> 00:49:30.838
It's a phenomenon having
to do with

634
00:49:30.905 --> 00:49:32.974
the moon being in its pedigree.

635
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:37.845
The part of Florida where
you're at can get to real bad.

636
00:49:37.912 --> 00:49:39.847
It's a full moon tonight and

637
00:49:39.914 --> 00:49:41.716
When the tide comes in,
there's a chance there won't be

638
00:49:41.783 --> 00:49:44.819
any dry land left
in the entire basin.

639
00:49:44.886 --> 00:49:47.487
It'll flood all the
little islands

640
00:49:47.554 --> 00:49:52.125
until the Keys on the outer
edge of the Florida Bay.

641
00:49:52.192 --> 00:49:56.463
Do whatever you can to find the
highest ground and wait it out.

642
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.231
I've always said that
I would go through

643
00:49:58.298 --> 00:50:00.802
hell and high water
to keep you safe.

644
00:50:00.868 --> 00:50:02.737
Now I know you've been
through hell

645
00:50:02.804 --> 00:50:07.875
and now you're gonna have to
go through high water, okay?

646
00:50:07.942 --> 00:50:09.543
Hang in there, honey.

647
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:13.347
Hang in there because help
is on the way, okay?

648
00:50:13.413 --> 00:50:15.315
Your dad loves you.

649
00:50:38.773 --> 00:50:40.240
I'm sorry.

650
00:50:43.111 --> 00:50:44.411
I know.

651
00:50:46.213 --> 00:50:48.983
I knew.

652
00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:51.184
Jason never stopped loving you.

653
00:50:52.787 --> 00:50:55.422
I didn't even want
to come on this gig.

654
00:50:55.489 --> 00:50:56.924
I didn't want
to come on this gig

655
00:50:56.991 --> 00:50:58.558
because I knew he was
still in love with you.

656
00:50:58.626 --> 00:50:59.927
And I know you guys broke up!

657
00:51:02.462 --> 00:51:04.866
And I wouldn't
have been with him

658
00:51:04.932 --> 00:51:06.768
if you guys were still together!

659
00:51:09.971 --> 00:51:12.840
You may not have loved him,

660
00:51:12.907 --> 00:51:14.341
but I did.

661
00:51:17.945 --> 00:51:19.379
And now he's gone.

662
00:51:24.351 --> 00:51:26.854
This is not what I wanted!

663
00:51:26.921 --> 00:51:29.389
Goddamn it!
This is not what I planned!

664
00:51:31.358 --> 00:51:35.163
I wanted a white picket fence!
I wanted...

665
00:51:35.228 --> 00:51:36.864
I wanted a dog!

666
00:51:36.931 --> 00:51:38.298
I wanted...

667
00:51:40.134 --> 00:51:41.334
Jason.

668
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:46.506
You had everything and
you threw it all away.

669
00:51:52.914 --> 00:51:54.381
I think you should know...

670
00:51:58.351 --> 00:52:01.321
this is not what
I planned for my life either!

671
00:52:04.324 --> 00:52:06.560
I'm not going down by shark.

672
00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:09.931
Yeah.

673
00:52:09.997 --> 00:52:11.666
How you wanna go down then?

674
00:52:15.636 --> 00:52:19.006
I don't know, but I'll
tell you one thing.

675
00:52:21.374 --> 00:52:24.011
This? Right here, all of this?

676
00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:27.247
This is not it!

677
00:52:31.018 --> 00:52:35.957
And I don't wanna be laying down
in some hospital bed

678
00:52:36.023 --> 00:52:39.160
tied up to machines with tubes
coming out of every

679
00:52:39.227 --> 00:52:44.264
hole in my body, just dwindling
while my family watches!

680
00:52:47.935 --> 00:52:52.039
I don't want to be
sitting there

681
00:52:52.106 --> 00:52:55.109
trying to find
something to say

682
00:52:55.176 --> 00:52:56.443
to make it all better.

683
00:53:03.416 --> 00:53:07.955
I wanna be 100 years old

684
00:53:08.022 --> 00:53:10.958
and surrounded by grandchildren.

685
00:53:12.927 --> 00:53:16.596
And I wanna be drinking
the best mug of tea

686
00:53:16.664 --> 00:53:19.000
you've ever had
in your entire life.

687
00:53:22.236 --> 00:53:24.806
That's how I'm gonna go out.

688
00:53:31.378 --> 00:53:34.215
You wanna die by tea?

689
00:53:34.282 --> 00:53:35.883
Yeah.

690
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.820
I think dying by tea sounds
really nice right about now.

691
00:53:40.721 --> 00:53:43.423
I thought tea extended
your life.

692
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:45.827
No. Talking about sweet tea.

693
00:53:45.893 --> 00:53:48.196
Oh, with sugar.

694
00:53:48.262 --> 00:53:50.497
And lemon.

695
00:53:50.564 --> 00:53:52.300
Lemon's good for you.

696
00:53:52.365 --> 00:53:56.270
Sugar? I don't approve.
It's bad. It's bad for you.

697
00:53:56.336 --> 00:53:57.905
You have a problem with sugar?

698
00:53:57.972 --> 00:53:59.841
Yeah, I have a problem
with sugar.

699
00:53:59.907 --> 00:54:01.575
Oh, my God.

700
00:54:01.642 --> 00:54:03.978
Yeah, I don't know if we can
be friends after this.

701
00:54:04.045 --> 00:54:05.378
Me either.

702
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.724
Was that your mom...
who you were talking about?

703
00:54:20.027 --> 00:54:21.361
Is that how she...

704
00:54:28.401 --> 00:54:29.569
Cancer.

705
00:54:32.505 --> 00:54:33.774
By the time they caught it,

706
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:35.209
there wasn't much
we could do

707
00:54:35.276 --> 00:54:36.878
except...

708
00:54:38.112 --> 00:54:39.546
sit and watch.

709
00:54:46.354 --> 00:54:47.688
That's...

710
00:54:52.459 --> 00:54:54.829
After that is when Jason
and I decided to split.

711
00:55:00.134 --> 00:55:03.838
I need you to know
that I did love him.

712
00:55:03.905 --> 00:55:05.472
I did.

713
00:55:08.376 --> 00:55:10.477
But I wasn't in love with him.

714
00:55:12.579 --> 00:55:14.115
And watching my mom,

715
00:55:18.252 --> 00:55:20.520
it just made me
re-evaluate everything.

716
00:55:25.893 --> 00:55:30.831
It made me realize that
that wasn't fair to him.

717
00:55:30.898 --> 00:55:35.670
It wasn't fair to keep him
in that when I knew that

718
00:55:35.736 --> 00:55:37.772
there was someone that
could love him better.

719
00:55:41.042 --> 00:55:42.710
Someone like you.

720
00:55:47.114 --> 00:55:52.585
That's why when I saw
him today, with you,

721
00:55:52.653 --> 00:55:55.690
and he was smiling
and he was laughing

722
00:55:55.756 --> 00:55:57.758
like a real Jason laugh.

723
00:56:02.196 --> 00:56:03.631
I was happy for him.

724
00:56:04.531 --> 00:56:07.467
I was. I was happy for him.

725
00:56:08.369 --> 00:56:12.807
That is what he deserves.

726
00:56:14.842 --> 00:56:16.177
It's what he deserved.

727
00:56:30.825 --> 00:56:32.559
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sarah!

728
00:56:32.626 --> 00:56:34.328
Sarah!
Sarah, Sarah!

729
00:56:34.395 --> 00:56:37.198
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

730
00:56:37.264 --> 00:56:39.800
Hey, over here!

731
00:56:39.867 --> 00:56:42.937
Hey, hey!

732
00:56:43.004 --> 00:56:45.639
- We're right here!
- We're over here!

733
00:56:48.042 --> 00:56:50.411
- Right here!
- Over here!

734
00:56:50.478 --> 00:56:51.812
Hey!

735
00:56:56.817 --> 00:56:58.719
Come on! Get the kayak.

736
00:57:01.889 --> 00:57:03.523
Ready, left to right,
left to right, tilt it.

737
00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:07.661
- Hey!
- Hey!

738
00:57:07.728 --> 00:57:09.596
- Hey!
- Hey!

739
00:57:17.671 --> 00:57:19.140
Okay, just... just...

740
00:57:20.808 --> 00:57:22.243
Get your phone!

741
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:23.811
Get your phone and
see if you got any service!

742
00:57:23.878 --> 00:57:25.746
I put a solar charger
in the dry bag!

743
00:57:29.083 --> 00:57:32.019
Full bars, but
the charger's not working!

744
00:57:32.086 --> 00:57:35.322
- Let me do it.
- What the heck?

745
00:57:35.389 --> 00:57:36.556
I got it, I got it!

746
00:57:38.325 --> 00:57:39.794
There's water in it.

747
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.995
Yeah, it hasn't
been charging.

748
00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.302
Meghan, we probably
just need to lay it out.

749
00:57:48.369 --> 00:57:50.271
- Just set it down.
- I'm trying to get it in.

750
00:57:50.337 --> 00:57:52.139
It hasn't been charging.

751
00:57:52.206 --> 00:57:54.008
It's dead.
Just let it go!

752
00:57:54.075 --> 00:57:56.010
Work!

753
00:57:56.077 --> 00:57:58.746
It's not gonna work.

754
00:57:58.813 --> 00:58:00.281
Let it go, just...

755
00:58:00.347 --> 00:58:01.449
It's connected.

756
00:58:01.515 --> 00:58:03.250
There, go, put it in.

757
00:58:07.421 --> 00:58:08.622
Oh my God.

758
00:58:09.824 --> 00:58:10.991
You fixed it.

759
00:58:13.327 --> 00:58:15.029
How'd you do it?

760
00:58:15.096 --> 00:58:16.864
Whoever said watching
random YouTube videos

761
00:58:16.931 --> 00:58:19.066
was stupid is wrong.

762
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:31.612
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah?

763
00:58:31.679 --> 00:58:33.581
Whoa, we were just
there a minute ago

764
00:58:33.647 --> 00:58:36.083
and now it's underwater!

765
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:38.786
What are we gonna do if this
whole thing goes underwater?

766
00:58:41.021 --> 00:58:43.023
We still have the kayaks.

767
00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:45.292
I'm not getting back
into that water!

768
00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:48.129
I think you were on to something
with the movement thing.

769
00:58:48.195 --> 00:58:50.064
We can just
minimize our movement

770
00:58:50.131 --> 00:58:52.032
and stick to the shallow areas.

771
00:58:52.099 --> 00:58:54.201
That thing is right
next to shore!

772
00:58:54.268 --> 00:58:57.304
I know that, but
you're not helping, okay?

773
00:58:57.371 --> 00:58:59.974
Right now, I need you
to look at the bright side!

774
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.711
Yeah? And what is that?

775
00:59:03.777 --> 00:59:05.146
We're not dead yet!

776
00:59:05.212 --> 00:59:08.115
Oh, right, yeah.
We're not dead yet.

777
00:59:09.283 --> 00:59:12.720
We're just stranded
on an island.

778
00:59:12.786 --> 00:59:15.756
A shark's trying to hunt us,

779
00:59:15.823 --> 00:59:18.926
the sea plane can't find us.

780
00:59:18.993 --> 00:59:23.063
And now the island is flooding!

781
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:24.365
What next?

782
00:59:24.431 --> 00:59:26.667
The shark's just gonna
turn into a tornado?

783
00:59:26.734 --> 00:59:28.302
I can't do this anymore, Sarah!

784
00:59:34.375 --> 00:59:36.177
Um...

785
00:59:46.453 --> 00:59:47.488
Yeah, hello? Sarah?

786
00:59:47.555 --> 00:59:49.023
Dad, dad!

787
00:59:49.089 --> 00:59:50.424
Yeah, it's me.
How are you doing?

788
00:59:50.491 --> 00:59:52.627
Yes, we're fine,
but I just saw a chopper.

789
00:59:52.693 --> 00:59:56.030
It was a single-engine chopper.
I think it was them.

790
00:59:56.096 --> 00:59:57.932
Well, that was it!
That's great!

791
00:59:57.998 --> 01:00:01.001
Can you give me more
information about the fly-by?

792
01:00:01.068 --> 01:00:03.672
That'll help me figure
out where exactly you are!

793
01:00:03.737 --> 01:00:05.005
They flew right over us.

794
01:00:05.072 --> 01:00:09.644
They flew right over us
to the east

795
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:11.478
and way north, Dad, way north!

796
01:00:11.545 --> 01:00:13.013
Well, that's helpful.

797
01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.782
They've been searching
on the other islands

798
01:00:14.848 --> 01:00:16.450
and they're expanding
from there.

799
01:00:16.517 --> 01:00:20.120
No, no, no!
We didn't go to Cudjoe Key, Dad!

800
01:00:20.187 --> 01:00:23.023
No, we're on this new island.

801
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.960
Jason said it just
formed in the hurricane.

802
01:00:26.026 --> 01:00:27.528
It just formed
like a month ago.

803
01:00:27.595 --> 01:00:29.263
And I don't even think
it's on their maps.

804
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:33.300
You must be south, southwest
of the search area.

805
01:00:33.367 --> 01:00:35.936
I'll have them modify
their search grid.

806
01:00:36.003 --> 01:00:37.238
If you can keep
your phone on,

807
01:00:37.304 --> 01:00:39.373
we might be
able to get a better lock

808
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.875
on your new location.

809
01:00:41.942 --> 01:00:44.679
I don't think we have much time.

810
01:00:44.745 --> 01:00:46.981
We may not be able
to stay here long.

811
01:00:47.047 --> 01:00:48.515
The water's rising.

812
01:00:48.582 --> 01:00:52.621
Okay, then stay calm, stay calm.

813
01:00:52.687 --> 01:00:54.321
Dad...

814
01:00:54.388 --> 01:00:58.559
Your area is experiencing a peak
of what they call king tides.

815
01:00:58.627 --> 01:01:00.327
You know about king tides?

816
01:01:00.394 --> 01:01:02.896
Yes, I know about king tides.
They're higher than normal.

817
01:01:02.963 --> 01:01:04.633
That's right.
Much higher.

818
01:01:04.699 --> 01:01:10.672
Unfortunately, that area you're
in can be particularly hard hit.

819
01:01:10.739 --> 01:01:14.676
It's the equivalent
of experiencing a storm surge,

820
01:01:14.743 --> 01:01:16.410
but it's with the tide alone.

821
01:01:16.477 --> 01:01:19.648
It's not based on weather,
but the phase of the moon.

822
01:01:19.714 --> 01:01:21.548
The stats tell me

823
01:01:21.616 --> 01:01:26.621
all the islands out there
may be overwhelmed.

824
01:01:26.688 --> 01:01:30.257
Hello?
You still there?

825
01:01:30.324 --> 01:01:32.026
Yes.

826
01:01:32.092 --> 01:01:33.260
You still have your kayaks?

827
01:01:33.327 --> 01:01:35.496
Yes, we have the kayaks,
Dad, but...

828
01:01:35.562 --> 01:01:38.399
Listen. I know this is gonna
be difficult

829
01:01:38.465 --> 01:01:40.534
and I wish I could
be there with you.

830
01:01:40.602 --> 01:01:43.370
But you and Meghan
have done great so far.

831
01:01:43.437 --> 01:01:44.872
You keep up what
you've been doing.

832
01:01:44.938 --> 01:01:47.141
It's been keeping
you both alive.

833
01:01:47.207 --> 01:01:50.311
Dad, be honest with me:

834
01:01:52.946 --> 01:01:55.449
if they don't find us
by sundown,

835
01:01:55.516 --> 01:01:58.519
are you guys gonna
suspend the search?

836
01:01:58.585 --> 01:01:59.987
We will find you, honey.

837
01:02:00.054 --> 01:02:02.657
We will find you!

838
01:02:02.724 --> 01:02:04.058
I know.

839
01:02:04.124 --> 01:02:05.559
I know that you
won't give up, Dad.

840
01:02:05.627 --> 01:02:09.263
But if the tides are as
powerful as you say,

841
01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.932
and...

842
01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:14.234
and if you guys have
to suspend the search,

843
01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:16.403
I just want you
to know that we tried.

844
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:21.275
The spotter helicopter
will find you!

845
01:02:21.342 --> 01:02:24.746
I just want you to know
that I love you

846
01:02:24.813 --> 01:02:26.447
and I went out fighting.

847
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:30.685
Stay on the line.

848
01:02:30.752 --> 01:02:32.353
I'm not gonna let you down.

849
01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:36.323
I've never done
that before, have I?

850
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.659
Okay, okay.

851
01:02:38.727 --> 01:02:41.462
- Dad!
- Sarah!

852
01:02:41.528 --> 01:02:42.764
Sarah, hello!

853
01:02:42.831 --> 01:02:45.299
Dad!

854
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:12.960
Civic Air Patrol,
Darren speaking.

855
01:03:13.026 --> 01:03:15.396
Hello, it's James Murray.

856
01:03:15.462 --> 01:03:17.531
I'm just off the phone
with my daughter.

857
01:03:17.598 --> 01:03:21.068
We have a new data set
for cellphone forensics.

858
01:03:21.135 --> 01:03:24.138
I had her on the line for
approximately three minutes.

859
01:03:24.204 --> 01:03:27.207
We need to expand the search
from our initial grid.

860
01:03:27.274 --> 01:03:30.144
I have new information
on her location.

861
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:33.981
Our initial search area,
I believe, was incorrect.

862
01:03:34.047 --> 01:03:37.317
They traveled to a new
location, another island.

863
01:03:37.384 --> 01:03:40.320
With the king tides,
the water is rising fast.

864
01:03:40.387 --> 01:03:42.189
Stand by.
I'll get right back to you.

865
01:03:42.256 --> 01:03:44.358
Copy that.
I'll get back to you soon.

866
01:04:01.275 --> 01:04:02.976
This island's flooded.

867
01:04:06.681 --> 01:04:08.081
We gotta go.

868
01:04:21.462 --> 01:04:22.664
We got this.

869
01:05:12.714 --> 01:05:15.950
I talked to Fish and Wildlife
and the NOAA Fisheries

870
01:05:16.016 --> 01:05:17.852
Southeast Marine
Mammal Stranding

871
01:05:17.919 --> 01:05:19.052
Network coordinator.

872
01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:20.554
You're not going
to believe this!

873
01:05:20.622 --> 01:05:23.524
Apparently a pod of pilot
whales stranded and died

874
01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:26.293
on the outer shoals
of Cudjoe Basin

875
01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.795
approximately two weeks ago.

876
01:05:27.862 --> 01:05:30.597
They tell me it was a
about thirty whales.

877
01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:33.100
It may have had something
to do with the hurricane.

878
01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:34.669
No-one knows.

879
01:05:34.736 --> 01:05:36.971
They were stranded and died
in the shallow water.

880
01:05:37.037 --> 01:05:40.207
Standard operating procedure
when something like that happens

881
01:05:40.274 --> 01:05:41.910
out there in such
a remote area is

882
01:05:41.976 --> 01:05:45.445
to leave the carcasses to
decay and return to nature,

883
01:05:45.512 --> 01:05:48.650
which NOAA confirmed they did.

884
01:05:48.716 --> 01:05:51.552
So there are whale carcasses
in the water down there?

885
01:05:51.619 --> 01:05:55.522
There were whales carcasses.
It gets complicated.

886
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:57.959
Apparently NOAA began
receiving reports

887
01:05:58.026 --> 01:06:01.128
from boaters and fishermen
of a massive great white shark

888
01:06:01.194 --> 01:06:03.130
feeding on the whales' remains.

889
01:06:03.196 --> 01:06:04.866
It was reported to be
a six-meter shark.

890
01:06:04.933 --> 01:06:07.334
Great whites are seasonal
visitors to the Keys.

891
01:06:07.401 --> 01:06:09.837
It is unusual for something
like this to show up

892
01:06:09.904 --> 01:06:12.105
in that area on the back side
of the keys.

893
01:06:12.172 --> 01:06:14.842
Well, sure, but if there's
something drawing it in

894
01:06:14.909 --> 01:06:17.645
like a pod of dead whales...

895
01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:20.782
Right, So after reports of the
large shark feeding in the area,

896
01:06:20.848 --> 01:06:23.718
NOAA decided to remove
the carcasses from the water

897
01:06:23.785 --> 01:06:27.321
in hopes that the shark
would leave.

898
01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:29.356
And that didn't happen?

899
01:06:29.423 --> 01:06:31.425
Well, they did
remove the carcasses,

900
01:06:31.491 --> 01:06:33.327
but the shark didn't leave.

901
01:06:33.393 --> 01:06:36.263
Does this explain
the shark's behavior?

902
01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:40.034
I put in a call to
the Mote Marine Laboratory.

903
01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:42.436
They have a few theories on what
is going on with the shark.

904
01:06:42.502 --> 01:06:44.806
Sharks are opportunistic feeders

905
01:06:44.872 --> 01:06:47.507
and finding something like
a whale is a rare opportunity.

906
01:06:47.574 --> 01:06:50.078
When they find a
large source of food

907
01:06:50.143 --> 01:06:51.813
such as those whale carcasses,

908
01:06:51.879 --> 01:06:54.281
the shark's appetite expands
to take advantage of the bounty.

909
01:06:54.348 --> 01:06:56.450
So basically the
appetite increases

910
01:06:56.516 --> 01:06:59.687
relative to the
availability of food.

911
01:06:59.754 --> 01:07:02.991
Encountering a dead whale for
a shark is a rare opportunity.

912
01:07:03.057 --> 01:07:05.793
And the expansion of appetite
is a natural way for the shark

913
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.363
to take advantage of an abundant
food supply while it lasts.

914
01:07:09.429 --> 01:07:11.633
It turbo charges
their appetites.

915
01:07:11.699 --> 01:07:14.301
This allows the shark to go
from feast to famine

916
01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:17.237
and survive periods
when it cannot find food,

917
01:07:17.304 --> 01:07:19.073
kind of like a lion at a kill.

918
01:07:19.139 --> 01:07:21.776
When it has to, it can eat many
times more food than normal.

919
01:07:21.843 --> 01:07:24.646
And this keeps it going
through lean times.

920
01:07:24.712 --> 01:07:26.914
So the presence of
the whale carcass

921
01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:30.450
increases the shark's appetite.

922
01:07:30.517 --> 01:07:33.087
And when they removed
the whales,

923
01:07:33.153 --> 01:07:35.890
instead of driving
the shark away,

924
01:07:35.957 --> 01:07:39.192
they left the shark
with super-sized appetite

925
01:07:39.259 --> 01:07:41.029
looking for prey.

926
01:07:41.095 --> 01:07:44.264
That's one of the theories,
and it makes sense to me.

927
01:07:44.331 --> 01:07:46.901
The biologists also surmise
that the shark

928
01:07:46.968 --> 01:07:49.804
may have become more aggressive
in a territorial manner.

929
01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:52.172
It may have had
to drive off other predators

930
01:07:52.239 --> 01:07:53.975
from the whale carcasses.

931
01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:55.409
If it's going after the kayaks,

932
01:07:55.475 --> 01:07:57.812
it could be defending
it's territory.

933
01:07:57.879 --> 01:08:00.648
The last theory is what
they call a rogue shark.

934
01:08:00.715 --> 01:08:03.250
This is a shark that,
for whatever reason,

935
01:08:03.316 --> 01:08:04.686
goes on a spree of attacks.

936
01:08:04.752 --> 01:08:08.056
There is historical
precedence for this,

937
01:08:08.122 --> 01:08:11.324
a few instances where a single
shark made multiple attacks.

938
01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:12.960
It's rare.
but it happens.

939
01:08:13.027 --> 01:08:15.429
Well, it sounds like it could
be a combination of both.

940
01:08:15.495 --> 01:08:18.532
We gotta find them and
get them off the water.

941
01:08:18.598 --> 01:08:21.435
And then make sure we're
searching for the right area.

942
01:08:21.501 --> 01:08:23.604
I know there are a lot
of islands out there.

943
01:08:23.671 --> 01:08:26.074
But based on
their original position,

944
01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.677
I think we've been searching
the wrong area.

945
01:08:29.744 --> 01:08:31.612
I know what the forensics
have been saying.

946
01:08:31.679 --> 01:08:35.983
But Sarah told me they paddled
out to a brand new sandbar.

947
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:38.452
Listen, these sandbars change.

948
01:08:38.518 --> 01:08:41.889
New ones form and
old ones disappear.

949
01:08:41.956 --> 01:08:43.557
I don 't think that
they were at any of the ones

950
01:08:43.624 --> 01:08:45.392
that we have on our maps.

951
01:08:45.459 --> 01:08:46.728
Copy that.

952
01:08:46.794 --> 01:08:47.995
Right now,
we're pushing the limit

953
01:08:48.062 --> 01:08:49.664
on our flying time out here.

954
01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:52.365
We can do a redirect depending
on where you tell me.

955
01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.401
That would involve a refueling.

956
01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:56.938
If that were to happen,
we'd have to go back

957
01:08:57.004 --> 01:08:58.706
to the airstrip to refuel,

958
01:08:58.773 --> 01:09:01.709
which would not allow us enough
daylight to finish our search.

959
01:09:01.776 --> 01:09:04.879
Are they still out
over the Cudjoe Basin?

960
01:09:04.946 --> 01:09:07.715
I mean, I think they can
manage this without refueling.

961
01:09:07.782 --> 01:09:09.382
Copy that.
It's your decision.

962
01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:10.918
But you do know if
we run out of fuel,

963
01:09:10.985 --> 01:09:12.385
that'll be the end of
the search for today.

964
01:09:12.452 --> 01:09:13.821
All right, I got you.

965
01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:14.989
Listen.

966
01:09:15.056 --> 01:09:17.125
Now they said they
saw your helicopter.

967
01:09:17.191 --> 01:09:20.194
You can't be too far off.

968
01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.629
Copy.
What is your redirect?

969
01:09:21.696 --> 01:09:24.932
I want you to change
the search grid, okay?

970
01:09:24.999 --> 01:09:28.770
We need to look on the same
line, but further south.

971
01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:33.507
If you only have fuel
enough to search one more place,

972
01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:35.143
then this would be it.

973
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:37.678
If this information's
incorrect, it's on you.

974
01:09:37.745 --> 01:09:40.447
Sir, this is my
daughter out there!

975
01:09:40.514 --> 01:09:43.283
If this is a rogue
shark attack like you say,

976
01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:45.519
we don't have time to waste!

977
01:09:45.585 --> 01:09:48.355
So please change
your search grid

978
01:09:48.421 --> 01:09:50.390
to the coordinates that follow.

979
01:10:07.307 --> 01:10:08.976
I see it!

980
01:10:09.043 --> 01:10:10.178
I see it, it's coming back!
It's coming back this way!

981
01:10:10.244 --> 01:10:11.179
Where?

982
01:10:11.245 --> 01:10:12.579
Sarah, it's right there!

983
01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:13.781
It's right there!
It's right there!

984
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:17.317
What do we do?
What do we do?

985
01:10:17.384 --> 01:10:18.953
Shh.

986
01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.621
Hold position.

987
01:10:38.505 --> 01:10:39.941
Stay calm!

988
01:10:54.822 --> 01:10:57.124
Meghan, I need you
to stay calm.

989
01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:18.980
Over here!

990
01:11:27.788 --> 01:11:29.657
Hold on, I'm gonna try
and flag him down.

991
01:11:33.895 --> 01:11:35.428
Come on!

992
01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:42.435
We have visual on the kayakers.
We have visual!

993
01:11:53.047 --> 01:11:54.749
Yeah, let me get
a little bit closer.

994
01:12:02.256 --> 01:12:03.490
Hey!

995
01:12:09.297 --> 01:12:11.332
Oh, there's a massive shark
circling the kayakers.

996
01:12:11.399 --> 01:12:12.700
Let me get a picture.

997
01:12:21.742 --> 01:12:23.344
All right, picture sent.

998
01:12:23.411 --> 01:12:26.614
We need to send a boat.
I can't get to the swimmers.

999
01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:29.482
Running low on fuel.
Headed back to base to refuel.

1000
01:12:33.287 --> 01:12:36.757
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1001
01:13:10.157 --> 01:13:12.093
Yeah, hello?

1002
01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:13.794
I just got your message!

1003
01:13:13.861 --> 01:13:15.629
Can't you land in there
and just pick them up?

1004
01:13:15.696 --> 01:13:17.365
That's a negative.

1005
01:13:17.431 --> 01:13:19.166
There's too many submerged
reefs where they're at.

1006
01:13:19.233 --> 01:13:21.836
How much is the draft
on that helicopter?

1007
01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:23.471
It's not the draft
of the chopper,

1008
01:13:23.536 --> 01:13:24.839
it's the water clarity.

1009
01:13:24.905 --> 01:13:27.241
Right now, the visual is
not clear enough

1010
01:13:27.308 --> 01:13:31.578
for our pilot to choose
a safe patch for landing.

1011
01:13:31.645 --> 01:13:33.580
We're directing a
boat to them now.

1012
01:13:33.647 --> 01:13:35.582
How long is it gonna take?

1013
01:13:35.649 --> 01:13:37.385
It should be under 10 minutes.

1014
01:13:37.451 --> 01:13:43.124
Can you guys in the helicopter
keep an eye on the shark?

1015
01:13:43.190 --> 01:13:44.759
That's a negative.

1016
01:13:44.825 --> 01:13:47.628
The spotter chopper has
to refuel and return to base.

1017
01:13:47.695 --> 01:13:49.296
Oh, come on!

1018
01:13:49.363 --> 01:13:51.465
I'm sorry. If that
chopper doesn't return to base

1019
01:13:51.531 --> 01:13:54.235
now to refuel,
it may not make it back.

1020
01:13:54.301 --> 01:13:57.805
Let me know the minute that
the boat reaches them.

1021
01:14:00.174 --> 01:14:01.609
They're gonna
come back, Meghan.

1022
01:14:01.675 --> 01:14:03.010
They're not gonna leave us here!

1023
01:14:03.077 --> 01:14:04.645
How do we know
they're gonna come back?

1024
01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:07.882
Stay calm.
They're going to come back.

1025
01:14:07.948 --> 01:14:09.817
Trust me!

1026
01:14:18.959 --> 01:14:20.094
Where's it going?
Where's it going?

1027
01:14:20.161 --> 01:14:21.095
Where's it going?

1028
01:14:38.412 --> 01:14:39.847
Where the hell did it go?

1029
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:43.284
Oh!

1030
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:45.286
There's a boat!
There's a boat!

1031
01:14:45.352 --> 01:14:46.520
Where?

1032
01:14:46.586 --> 01:14:47.721
Hey! Come on!
Head over here!

1033
01:14:47.788 --> 01:14:48.756
- That's them!

1034
01:14:48.823 --> 01:14:51.591
- Hey!
- Hey!

1035
01:14:51.659 --> 01:14:53.260
Over here!

1036
01:14:54.795 --> 01:14:56.497
There's a reef there!
It's too shallow!

1037
01:14:56.564 --> 01:14:58.399
Come to us!

1038
01:14:58.466 --> 01:14:59.767
Paddle, paddle!

1039
01:14:59.834 --> 01:15:02.236
Come on. Let's go!

1040
01:15:09.543 --> 01:15:12.546
Hey!

1041
01:15:12.613 --> 01:15:14.515
Hey, come to us!

1042
01:15:14.582 --> 01:15:16.283
Please!

1043
01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:17.918
No! You have to come to us!

1044
01:15:17.985 --> 01:15:18.853
Come on!

1045
01:15:18.919 --> 01:15:20.121
Please meet us!

1046
01:15:21.789 --> 01:15:23.757
Meghan!

1047
01:15:24.625 --> 01:15:25.960
Here.

1048
01:15:27.761 --> 01:15:29.130
Meghan!

1049
01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:36.704
Grab my paddle!

1050
01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:38.339
Grab my hand!
I got you! I got you!

1051
01:15:38.405 --> 01:15:40.141
Come on!

1052
01:15:43.511 --> 01:15:45.713
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

1053
01:15:53.587 --> 01:15:55.422
Where is it?
Do you see it?

1054
01:15:58.292 --> 01:16:00.794
I don't see it!
I don't see it, Sarah!

1055
01:16:00.861 --> 01:16:03.632
That way.
Go that way! That way!

1056
01:16:20.447 --> 01:16:22.016
I lost the knife!

1057
01:16:22.082 --> 01:16:24.518
Come on! Come on!
Hurry up!

1058
01:16:24.585 --> 01:16:26.187
Go! Go, Meghan!

1059
01:17:15.302 --> 01:17:17.338
Go, Meghan, go!

1060
01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.054
Sarah Murray!

1061
01:19:14.121 --> 01:19:15.522
Got your father on the phone.

1062
01:19:21.929 --> 01:19:24.465
Sarah, Sarah, are you there?

1063
01:19:26.701 --> 01:19:28.068
I'm here, Daddy.

1064
01:19:31.806 --> 01:19:34.441
All right.
Thank God, thank God.

1065
01:19:34.508 --> 01:19:36.977
Are you hurt?
Are you okay?

1066
01:19:40.381 --> 01:19:41.850
I'm...

1067
01:19:41.915 --> 01:19:44.819
We're okay, we're okay.

1068
01:19:44.885 --> 01:19:46.253
All right, good.

1069
01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.422
Listen, now paramedics
are gonna be meeting you

1070
01:19:48.489 --> 01:19:51.125
at the docks, okay?

1071
01:19:51.191 --> 01:19:52.627
I know you're a tough cookie,

1072
01:19:52.694 --> 01:19:54.895
but they're gonna have
to check you over.

1073
01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:57.064
I'm catching
the red eye over tonight.

1074
01:19:57.131 --> 01:19:59.433
I'll be seeing you as soon
as I get there.

1075
01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.901
Okay.

1076
01:20:00.968 --> 01:20:04.004
Listen, you did good, honey,
just like I knew you would.

1077
01:20:04.071 --> 01:20:06.608
Your mom would be proud of you.

1078
01:20:09.744 --> 01:20:11.512
Dad?

1079
01:20:11.578 --> 01:20:12.680
Yeah?

1080
01:20:16.417 --> 01:20:17.518
When I get back,

1081
01:20:19.987 --> 01:20:22.089
I wanna
talk about Mom's studio.

1082
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:25.125
Okay, honey, okay.

1083
01:20:25.192 --> 01:20:28.061
I don't know. Maybe I could
pick up the brush again.

1084
01:20:31.298 --> 01:20:33.701
I think that could be good.

1085
01:20:33.768 --> 01:20:36.236
We'll go with whatever you want.

1086
01:20:36.303 --> 01:20:38.172
It's all right with me,
whatever you want.

1087
01:20:38.238 --> 01:20:41.041
You just let me know.

1088
01:20:41.108 --> 01:20:45.914
I love you, honey.

1089
01:20:45.979 --> 01:20:47.114
I love you, too, Dad.

1090
01:20:47.981 --> 01:20:49.216
I love you, too.

1091
01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:51.920
Can you still hear me?

1092
01:20:51.985 --> 01:20:53.153
Yes.

1093
01:20:55.924 --> 01:20:58.358
All right, honey.
Listen, I love you.

1094
01:20:58.425 --> 01:21:01.261
I love you very, very much,
more than you'll ever know.

1095
01:21:01.328 --> 01:21:04.231
Okay, I'm glad you're okay.

1096
01:21:05.667 --> 01:21:06.634
Goodbye.

1097
01:21:19.747 --> 01:21:21.014
Hey, Sarah?

1098
01:21:23.183 --> 01:21:29.089
If you ever ask me
to do your makeup again,

1099
01:21:29.156 --> 01:21:32.426
I'm gonna have to say no.

1100
01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:37.932
And it's nothing personal.

1101
01:21:37.998 --> 01:21:41.268
Like you're... you're great.

1102
01:21:41.335 --> 01:21:45.105
It's just I can never,

1103
01:21:45.172 --> 01:21:48.509
ever do this again.

1104
01:21:52.079 --> 01:21:53.380
Yeah, me neither.

1105
01:21:56.918 --> 01:21:59.821
You really like painting?

1106
01:21:59.888 --> 01:22:04.091
I think New Mexico would be
a great place for you.

1107
01:22:04.157 --> 01:22:06.393
Georgia O'Keefe
used to live there.

1108
01:22:09.363 --> 01:22:11.766
And, um,

1109
01:22:11.833 --> 01:22:17.437
she would sit there
and she would just paint.

1110
01:22:17.504 --> 01:22:19.439
And I think the moment
you'd get there,

1111
01:22:19.506 --> 01:22:21.643
you'd never ever want to leave.

1112
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.651
And you know the best
part about New Mexico?

1113
01:22:32.586 --> 01:22:34.555
No.

1114
01:22:34.622 --> 01:22:36.523
No water!

1115
01:22:39.027 --> 01:22:41.663
No ocean!

1116
01:22:41.729 --> 01:22:42.830
No lakes!

1117
01:22:44.231 --> 01:22:46.166
It's just dry.

1118
01:22:48.235 --> 01:22:51.138
Sounds pretty good.

1119
01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:54.207
I'm in.

1120
01:22:56.744 --> 01:23:01.214
I am totally in.

1121
01:23:48.929 --> 01:23:53.929
