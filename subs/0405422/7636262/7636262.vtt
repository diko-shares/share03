How you doing?

get a car?
I can't afford it.

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.093
Okay, take care.
See you. Bye-bye.

Good morning, Paula.

Excuse me.
I have a question.

23
00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:13.778
What is the difference between
Hi8 and Digital video tapes?

24
00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:16.447
I'm not a salesman,
so, I could probably...

25
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.241
Welcome to Smart Tech.
How can I be of service
to you?

26
00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:20.868
Well, I was just
wondering

27
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.454
what is the difference
between these?

28
00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:27.208
JAY:
Well, if I'm photographing
someone as fine as yourself

29
00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:29.043
I'd probably go Digital.

Oh, man.

33
00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:50.606
I had a weekend.
Yeah?

34
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:54.026
We went to Tijuana, Mexico,
you know,

35
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.029
and we thought
it would be fun, you know,
to go to this show.

36
00:03:57.113 --> 00:03:59.407
Everyone's, "You gotta
check out one of these shows."

37
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.034
And, you know,
it's a woman fucking a horse.

38
00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:05.579
We get there,
and, you know, we think
it's gonna be awesome

39
00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:09.041
and it is not as cool
as it sounds like
it would be, man.

40
00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:11.585
It's kind of gross.
Yeah.

41
00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.337
You think,
"A woman fucking a horse"

42
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.005
and you get there
and it's

43
00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.924
a woman fucking a horse.
Yeah.

44
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.009
It was really
giving it to her.

45
00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:20.428
And you know what,

46
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:23.097
to be honest, I felt
bad for her. We all
just felt bad for her.

47
00:04:23.222 --> 00:04:24.890
Yeah.
Kind of felt bad
for the horse.

48
00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:28.185
Wow, that's something.
So what did you get up to?

49
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.314
You know, I just kind
of hung out. I was...

50
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.275
God, Friday,
when I went home

51
00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:36.610
I really wanted
an egg-salad sandwich.

52
00:04:36.694 --> 00:04:38.696
And I was just obsessing
about it and I was like,

53
00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.781
"Man, I'm gonna
make one of those."

54
00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:44.326
So Saturday I went out
and I got, like,
a dozen eggs

55
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.996
and I boiled them all
and then I just,

56
00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.040
I spent, I don't know,
probably three hours,

57
00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:53.711
like, three-and-a-half hours
making,

58
00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:57.840
you know, the mayonnaise
and the onions and paprika

59
00:04:57.923 --> 00:04:59.967
and, you know,
all the accoutrement.

60
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.510
And then, by the time
I was done

61
00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:03.179
I just really didn't feel
like eating it.

62
00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:05.848
I can imagine.
And I didn't have any bread.

63
00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:09.727
So, you know,
it was pretty good.
It was a good weekend.

64
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:12.855
Sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, it was fine.

65
00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:14.356
Sounds really fun.

66
00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.859
Cool.
Cool.

67
00:05:16.942 --> 00:05:18.360
Cool, cool.

68
00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:23.032
Hey, Paula.
Yeah.

69
00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:25.618
I gotta tell you something.
I'm really excited about it.

70
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:29.079
For the first time today,
I woke up,

71
00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:33.501
I came to the store,
and I feel confident
to say to you

72
00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:36.170
that if you don't take
this Michael McDonald DVD

73
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:38.631
that you've been playing
for two years straight, off,

74
00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:40.382
I'm going to kill everyone
in the store

75
00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:42.343
and put a bullet
in my brain.

76
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.138
David, what do you suggest
we play?
I don't care. Anything.

77
00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:49.183
I would rather watch
<i>Beautician and the Beast.</i>

78
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.852
I would rather listen
to Fran Drescher
for eight hours

79
00:05:51.936 --> 00:05:53.687
than have to listen
to Michael McDonald.

80
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:57.024
Nothing against him,
but if I hear <i>Yah Mo B There</i>
one more time

81
00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:59.527
I'm gonna yah mo
burn this place
to the ground.

82
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.488
You're such a smart ass.
Get back on the floor.

83
00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:05.950
(GARBLED)
Fuck you.

84
00:06:06.075 --> 00:06:07.117
(CLEARS THROAT)

85
00:06:07.326 --> 00:06:09.954
This is a great TV.
Nothing beats a plasma.

86
00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:11.622
What are you doing?
That's my customer.

87
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.875
It certainly is not.
When I came upon her,
she was unattended.

88
00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.627
No, that's my...
Wait.

89
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.754
Go to the checkout there.
Pick up there, please.

90
00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:20.631
She was unattended
because I went to the back

91
00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:22.508
to get the brochure
that she requested.

92
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:24.051
I apologize,
but it's too late.

93
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.678
The transaction
has been completed.

94
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:27.471
Then you're gonna give me
half the commission.

95
00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:29.014
You'll receive
none of the commission.

96
00:06:29.098 --> 00:06:30.558
I need to talk to Paula.
This is crazy.

97
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:31.642
This is bullshit.

98
00:06:31.725 --> 00:06:33.561
Every time I make a sale,
you go crying to Paula.

99
00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:36.939
How about Jesse Jackson?
Old Jesse needs a cause.

100
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.566
Sick of you poaching
my customers.

101
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.150
I'm sick of your
crybaby bullshit.

102
00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:43.237
You wanna take this
shit outside? Just take it
outside and squash it?

103
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.574
Let's stay inside,
so everybody can see
what a pussy you have, okay?

104
00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:50.077
Because when I remove
the blade I keep in my boot
from its sheath,

105
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.997
I can't return it
until it has spilled blood.

106
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.333
Look, listen to me.
You are fucking
with the wrong nigger.

107
00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:00.337
Hey! You're fucking with
the wrong sand-nigger, okay?

108
00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:02.923
Dude, I will hang your old ass
by your turban.

109
00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.176
Turban now? Do you see
any fucking turban here?

110
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.928
Do I talk like a turban guy?

111
00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:10.889
Do I say, "Hey, Jay,
do you want a Slurpee?
You want a Slurpee?"

112
00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:14.184

I was born in Brooklyn.

My accent is a fucking
Brooklyn accent, okay? Okay?

115
00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:20.399
All right, man.
Calm down, dude.

116
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:22.610
Look, you still covering
my shift on Friday or what?

117
00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:25.613
If I can keep this commission,
with pleasure.

118
00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:28.574
Cool, then. All right, pop.
No problem.

119
00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.203
How about Andy?
No.

120
00:07:33.537 --> 00:07:35.122
Come on, man.
We need, what,
five guys

121
00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:36.707
to play a decent
poker game, right?
Yeah.

122
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.334
If we cancel this,
I'm gonna have to go

123
00:07:38.417 --> 00:07:40.336
to some stupid-ass
birthday party with Jill

124
00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:41.670

ain't happening.

DAVID:
Why not?

126
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:47.134
He's a really nice guy and all
but I'm pretty sure that

127
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:48.552
he is a serial murderer.

128
00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:50.346
Who cares, man?
He's a nice guy.

129
00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:52.723
I just wanna get drunk,
fucked up,
and play some cards.

130
00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.933
That's great.
Look, I don't wanna
end up a lampshade

131
00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:57.019
in some creepy apartment,
that's what I'm saying.

132
00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.146
I don't really see
any other options.

133
00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.774
Andy. My man.

134
00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:04.610
You got any plans
later on tonight?

135
00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:06.904
Why, do we have to unload
the Sony truck?

136
00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:10.074
No, the guys
are getting together,
we're playing some poker

137
00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:12.159
thought, you know,
you'd wanna play.

138
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:13.702
With you guys?

139
00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:17.748
Yeah, sure.
That would be cool.

140
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:21.251
You know how to play, right?
Yeah, I play online sometimes.

141
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:23.629
We're gonna play
in the store.
Great.

142
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:25.339
Are we allowed
to do that?

143
00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.049
Absolutely not.
Yeah.

144
00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:28.258
Oh.

145
00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:30.427
Well, so I'm gonna
go tell Paula.

146
00:08:31.637 --> 00:08:33.055
I'm just kidding.

147
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:36.225
I'm kidding.
That sounds great. Cool,
I'll see you guys tonight.

148
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.393
Okay.
All right.

149
00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.103
(CLATTERING)
Oops.

150
00:08:41.063 --> 00:08:42.981
I almost feel guilty.
No, you don't.

151
00:08:57.496 --> 00:08:58.914
Going down!

152
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.375
Going down!

153
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.626
Dumbass.

154
00:09:03.502 --> 00:09:04.962
And a full house.

155
00:09:05.421 --> 00:09:06.797
Oh, my dukes!
What?

156
00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:09.258
How much fucking online poker
do you play, dawg?

157
00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:12.386
For like an hour or two
a night, when I'm not
playing Halo.

158
00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.347
Why did you invite this guy?
He's a fucking ringer, man.

159
00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:16.598
This is hog shit.

160
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:18.892
You, you're a fucking asshole
to tell me to come here.

161
00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:20.769
You tell me he was a nice guy,
didn't you?

162
00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:23.188
Well, fuck you people,
and fuck you, you and you...

163
00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:26.233
fuck and kiss my big brown
fucking ass, okay?

164
00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:27.693

I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

165
00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:28.819

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:36.285
Dude, you totally...
Oh, shit, I gotta go. Damn.

170
00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:38.036
About to go see Ellen
in a little bit.

171
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.580
Going now?
Late-night action, huh?

172
00:09:39.663 --> 00:09:40.748
Dude, you know
how it goes.

173
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:43.292
Does your girlfriend know
about all these
late-night visits?

174
00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:44.918
It's like an unspoken
agreement. Yeah.

175
00:09:45.002 --> 00:09:48.088
It's like a completely
and utterly unspoken
agreement.

176
00:09:48.172 --> 00:09:50.299
If you knew her, if you knew
who I was dealing with,

177
00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:51.592
you wouldn't be
saying this shit.

178
00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.594
There's nothing you can't do
with this woman

179
00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:55.763
straight up and down.
I've done
every single thing

180
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:57.723
I could possibly create.
I've literally lubed up

181
00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:00.142
and made love to the arches
of her feet. All right.

182
00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.310
Wow!
JAY:
Yeah.

183
00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.061
Foot fuck!
That's sick, man.

184
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:04.688
Wow.
That is not sick.

185
00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:06.982
I will give you sick.
Oh, shit.

186
00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:09.860
I was sleeping with a woman
recently, she had the...

187
00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:13.238
Her tits were unbelievable.
Oh, man, I love titties.

188
00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:16.408
And so we're doing it
and I'm about to finish

189
00:10:16.492 --> 00:10:18.494
and her dog starts
licking my ass.

190
00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:22.873
I swear to God, I have
to decide, do I finish
or do I stop the dog?

191
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.833
I know your nasty ass.
He finished.

192
00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:27.294
I finished.
And then I stole the dog.

193
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.214
No, I didn't, but...

194
00:10:30.506 --> 00:10:32.966
You know, sometimes,
Amy and I would make love

195
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.135
till it was almost like
we weren't two people

196
00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:37.888
but we were two spirits
or something.

197
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.141
Our souls were
connected in this way,
I can't describe it.

198
00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:44.812
Time stood still.
It was like we were
sharing the same heart.

199
00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:48.690
Stop, man! Why do you
always come and kill the vibe
with those things?

200
00:10:48.774 --> 00:10:50.734
"Sharing the same heart,"
that's like some

201
00:10:50.818 --> 00:10:51.944
Britney Spears shit, man.

202
00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.988
This is three grown ass men,
don't nobody want to hear
that shit.

203
00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:57.324
Yeah, man, come on,
nobody wants to
hear that shit.

204
00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.993
Thank you, Andy.
Dude, you broke up
two years ago.

205
00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:02.496
You get over it
at some point.
Two years, man.

206
00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.122
You need to get past that

207
00:11:04.206 --> 00:11:07.417
because no ass
is worth thinking
that much about

208
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.002
I always say.

209
00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:10.671
Andy, do me a favor.

210
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:14.174
Would you please help him
redeem himself by telling
a real sex story?

211
00:11:14.258 --> 00:11:15.259
Yes.

212
00:11:16.552 --> 00:11:19.930
I don't... You know what,
I'm a gentleman
and I don't...

213
00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:21.807
I don't kiss and tell.

214
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.227
Fuck it, I raise you.
Nastiest shit
you've ever done.

215
00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.187
I'm talking about nasty.

216
00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.439
Wow.

217
00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.609
So many stories
are running through
my head right now.

218
00:11:34.695 --> 00:11:36.196
I dated this girl

219
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.367
for a while, and she was
really a nasty freak.

220
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:45.289
She just loved to get down
with sex all the time.

221
00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:47.916
She was like, any time of day,
she was like,

222
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.752
"Yeah, let's go.
I'm so nasty."

223
00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:52.129
And I'd be nailing her.

224
00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.422
Oh, shit.
She'd be like,

225
00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.883
"Oh, you're nailing me. Cool."

226
00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:59.553
She talk dirty to you?
She loved to dirty-talk.

227
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.431
Totally into it.
She'd be like,

228
00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:07.477
"Yeah, let's screw, let's...
I wanna fuck."

229
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.147
God, it was so dirty.

230
00:12:10.606 --> 00:12:14.693
She'd be like, "Me so horny,
me love you long time."

231
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:15.986
So...

232
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:18.947
JAY:
So what were the titties like?
Yeah, describe her...

233
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:21.158
Yeah, she had great tits.

234
00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:24.411
No, I mean, like, detailed.
Did she have, like,
you know,

235
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.246
them little pink
teeny nipples.
Oh, yeah.

236
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.832
JAY:
Or like the long
<i>National Geographic</i> nipples.

237
00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:31.460
You have like
the bumpy Braille nipples,
the Stevie Wonders.

238
00:12:31.543 --> 00:12:32.920
ANDY:
Yeah, they were nice.

239
00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:36.214
You know, when you, like,
you grab a woman's breast
and it's...

240
00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.759
And you feel it and

241
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:43.513
it feels like a bag of sand
when you're touching it.

242
00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.183
Bag of sand?

243
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.437
You know what I mean.
Why don't we just play?

244
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.189
Why don't you just
deal the cards?

245
00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.899
What are you
talking about?

246
00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:56.026
Have you ever felt
a breast before, man?

247
00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:57.110
Yes.

248
00:12:57.194 --> 00:12:59.738
Dude, are you gay?
No, I'm not gay.

249
00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.490
I've been with
tons of women.

250
00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.533
I touched a guy's balls
at Hebrew school once.

251
00:13:03.617 --> 00:13:05.577
Dude, it's not a big deal.
You like to fuck guys.

252
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:08.288
I'm cool. I got friends
who fuck guys, in jail.

253
00:13:08.497 --> 00:13:09.706
No, I'm not gay.

254
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.793
No, I've borked a lot of women
in my day.

255
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:14.002
You've "borked"?

256
00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:17.047
Hold up.
Yo, answer this question,

257
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.424
Are you a virgin?

258
00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.386
Are you a virgin?

259
00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:24.805
Yeah, not since I was 10.

260
00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.432
It all makes sense.
You're a virgin.

261
00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:30.018
I am... Shut up.
How does that happen?

262
00:13:30.102 --> 00:13:31.520
He's a fucking virgin.

263
00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:34.898
I knew it. That makes
so much sense, man.
Look, he's a virgin.

264
00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:37.275
You guys are hilarious.
All right, come on,
don't be mean.

265
00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.444
I'm not being mean.
I'm trying to
help the partner out.

266
00:13:39.528 --> 00:13:41.238
I'm trying to say
I wanna get you laid, dude.

267
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:42.489
I understand
what's going on.

268
00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:45.409
You guys are so up your asses.

269
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:49.037
From now on,
your dick is my dick.
I'm getting you some pussy.

270
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:50.998
(MEN LAUGHING)

271
00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:03.927
A bag of sand! Come on, man!
You could do better than that.

272
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.806
God, me so horny?
Me so stupid!

273
00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.267
(YELLING)

274
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.439
Oh, come on.

275
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:17.399
(LAUGHING)

276
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.194
It's gonna be fine.
They don't even remember.

277
00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:23.030
Those guys are cool.

278
00:14:28.118 --> 00:14:29.453
(ALARM BUZZING)

279
00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.330
This is gonna be bad.

280
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.125
ANDY:
Yeah, well,
virgin's not a dirty word.

281
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.210
You know what's a dirty word,
is asshole

282
00:14:37.294 --> 00:14:38.795
and that's what you guys are.

283
00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:42.132
You know,
I may not have had sex,
but I could fuck you up.

284
00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.343
Yeah.

285
00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.017
Come on.

286
00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.855
Hey, David.
Hey, Andy.

287
00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:02.110
What's up?
Cal, good morning.

288
00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.159
HAZIZ:
Hey, Andy.
Hey.

289
00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.161
We're gonna have to get you
some punani.

290
00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:12.662
(BOTH GUFFAWING)

291
00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:17.084
Andy, it's going down,
partner. We're gonna be...

292
00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.502
(MOANING)

293
00:15:19.503 --> 00:15:21.755
This for you, partner,
this for you.

294
00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:24.758
Waves of them coming at you
on Friday, Saturday.

295
00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.427
By Sunday,
your nuts gonna be drained.

296
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:31.181
Hey, Andy, don't let him
bother you. It's okay
not to have sex.

297
00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.642
Not everybody
is a pussy magnet.

298
00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:37.687
What are you? 25?
I'm 40.

299
00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.440
Holy shit, man.
You've got to get on that.

300
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.903
Life isn't about sex.
Life is about children
and passion.

301
00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:46.196
Yeah.

302
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.365
And spirit.
Yeah, life's about passion.

303
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.992
It's not about fucking
and balls and pussy.

304
00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:54.371
It's about love.
It's about people.

305
00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.958
It's about connection.
It's all about connections.

306
00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:02.212
It's not about cock
and ass and tits
and butthole pleasures.

307
00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.005
It's not about
butthole pleasures at all.

308
00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:07.300
It's not about
this rusty trombone
and dirty Sanchez.

309
00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:10.387
Please stop.
And Cincinnati bowtie.

310
00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:15.308
And your pussy juice cocktail
and this shit-stained balls.

311
00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:16.852
Mooj, just please stop.
Just relax...

312
00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:19.145
All right.
That's enough, party's over.

313
00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.314
Let the virgin
get back to work.

314
00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:26.736
Andy!

315
00:16:27.028 --> 00:16:29.406
Andy, come on.
We were just kidding.

316
00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:30.824
Pointless.

317
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.159
Andy, nobody cares
that you're a virgin.

318
00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.078
Don't be such a baby.

319
00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.539
They were just having fun.
They didn't mean anything.

320
00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.416
Get away from me, David.
Wait a minute.

321
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:41.418
Stop following me!
Hold up.

322
00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:46.840
Hold on.
I'm gonna have to
quit my job now.

323
00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:48.174
You don't have to
quit your job.

324
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.051
You know what, I don't wanna
go out with you guys.

325
00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:51.469
Fine.
Okay? I don't need your help.

326
00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.014
Okay, fine, you don't
have to go out with us
if you don't want.

327
00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.725
You know what,
I respect women,
I love women.

328
00:16:57.058 --> 00:17:00.437
I respect them so much
that I completely
stay away from them.

329
00:17:00.645 --> 00:17:02.898
Okay.
I have a very fulfilling life.

330
00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:04.941
(PLAYING)

331
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:10.488
And now, I am making
your silver pants blue.

332
00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.491
Get some roadburn, come on!

333
00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:15.952

around the world</i>

335
00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.625

to show you</i>

336
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:22.876
(LAUGHING)

337
00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.544
Oh, my God!

338
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.551
Hey, Will and Grace,
back to work.

339
00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:33.803
Hey, Haziz, can you just
give us a second?

340
00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:36.181
We're just kind of
in the middle of something.

341
00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:37.933
I'm on my break, okay?

342
00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:40.435
Fuck off, Haziz.
Leave us alone, all right?

343
00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:42.604
Fuck off? Fuck you!
Fuck you!

344
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.648
Fuck you! Fuck off.
Fuck off.

345
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.441
I'm gonna kick you
in the nuts, asshole.

346
00:17:46.524 --> 00:17:49.736
Hey, hey!
Watch the language, okay?
I have a family.

347
00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:50.904
Watch how you talk to me!

348
00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:53.990
It's a free country, Bambi.
I can smoke out here
if I want to.

349
00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:55.325
Smoke my pole.

350
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.702
You are a very unkind man.
Get inside!

351
00:17:57.786 --> 00:17:59.079
This is not professional.

352
00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:01.539
Paula,
this asshole over here...

353
00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:03.333
It's okay.
HAZIZ:
Paula!

354
00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:05.919
It's all right. Come on.
You know, it's just...

355
00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.296
So, how could this
not have happened?

356
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.298
It just never happened.

357
00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:14.135
When I was young, I tried,
and it didn't happen.

358
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:18.181
And then I got older and I got
more and more nervous

359
00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:21.726
because it hadn't
happened yet.
And I got kind of

360
00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:25.355
weirded out about it.
Then it really
didn't happen

361
00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.650
and then, I don't know,
I just kind of stopped trying.

362
00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.361
Do you want to give it
another shot?

363
00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.196
Maybe it's too late.

364
00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:37.117
Sometimes I feel that
it is just too late for me.

365
00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.494
No, that's crazy.

366
00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:42.539
You're 40 years old.
You know, 40 is the new 20.

367
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:44.624
You wanna spend
the next 60 years
of your life

368
00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:46.167
never experiencing sex?

369
00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.294
And not just sex, but love

370
00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:53.341
and a relationship,
and laughing and cuddling
and all that shit.

371
00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.301
I don't know.

372
00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:59.681
I wouldn't know what to do.
Look, you gotta take a risk.

373
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.516
You gotta risk it.
Look at me.

374
00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.393
I went out with this girl
for four months

375
00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.228
and it was the greatest,

376
00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.605
greatest thing in my life.

377
00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:12.444
Until she went down on this
guy in an Escalade, I think.

378
00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.654
And, you know,
instead of saying,

379
00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:17.699
"Okay, what am I doing
that caused this behavior?"

380
00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.617
I dumped her. Stupid decision.

381
00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:22.537
I spent the last two years
of my life regretting it.

382
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.497
Why don't you
get her back right now?

383
00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:26.666
Because she's dating
this pot dealer.

384
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.376
Stupid horrible decision.

385
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.629
But, hey, that's her journey,
you know.
I gotta respect that.

386
00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:32.964
I gotta give her the space.

387
00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:36.968
She wants to be
some immature little bitch
and blow everybody,

388
00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:39.054
that's love, man.
It sounds horrible.

389
00:19:39.137 --> 00:19:41.264
Of course it's horrible.
It's suffering

390
00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:43.850
and it's pain and it's...
You know, you lose weight

391
00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.435
and then you
put back on weight

392
00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.604
and then you call them
a bunch of times

393
00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:51.024
and you try and email
and then they move
or they change their email

394
00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.650
but that's just love.

395
00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.028
Do you realize that
this is the first time

396
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.405
we've spoken for more than,
like, 30 seconds?

397
00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:58.573
Uh-huh.

398
00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:01.785
It's kind of nice.
Come out with us this weekend.

399
00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:04.954
No pressure.
We'll just have a good time.

400
00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:07.791
Okay, yeah, I will.
I'll give it a shot.

401
00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:08.875
Great.

402
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.169
But I'm not going to have sex
with anybody.

403
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.963
Good, sex should be
the last thing on your mind.

00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:18.289
Look where you going.
I don't wanna say
the word anymore.

676
00:33:18.372 --> 00:33:20.624
Say what word?
"Pussy." I don't wanna say it.

677
00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:23.002
Fuck it.
"Pussy" is a scientific word.

678
00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:25.170
Dude! New pants, man.

679
00:33:25.713 --> 00:33:26.797
You know what, Dave?

680
00:33:26.881 --> 00:33:29.341
You know, you said
there wasn't gonna be
any pressure at all.

681
00:33:29.425 --> 00:33:31.051
(David)
I'm not pressuring you.
Excuse me.

682
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:32.761
Can one of you guys
help me, please?

683
00:33:32.845 --> 00:33:34.388
No <i>hablo</i> English, lady.

684
00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:38.100
I actually am helping
a customer right now.

685
00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:40.519
Okay, well...
I'm on break.

686
00:33:40.603 --> 00:33:43.147
But our stock supervisor
is very knowledgeable.

687
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.733
He can answer
all of your questions
and he'd love to help you.

688
00:33:45.816 --> 00:33:46.859
Thank you.

689
00:33:46.942 --> 00:33:48.527
Have a nice day.
You, too.

690
00:33:49.528 --> 00:33:53.782
Great, okay. Hi, I'm Trish.
Hi, Andy is my name.

691
00:33:54.283 --> 00:33:57.369
This one looks pretty good.
You don't wanna buy that VCR.

692
00:33:57.453 --> 00:33:58.454
I don't?

693
00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:00.289
No, actually to be
totally honest with you...

694
00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:01.707
you don't wanna buy
any VCR.

695
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.459
It's a dead technology.

696
00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:07.671
It's like getting
an eight-track player.

697
00:34:07.755 --> 00:34:10.132
Yeah.
Or a Betamax.

698
00:34:10.215 --> 00:34:12.301
You know what, actually
I'd recommend this one.

699
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:13.469
This is a dual.

700
00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:16.639
You've got the VCR
and DVD combo.

701
00:34:16.722 --> 00:34:20.225
So, you know,
that technology would be
probably pretty good for...

702
00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:21.644
Six months or so?
Yeah.

703
00:34:21.727 --> 00:34:23.020
That's good.

704
00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:25.064
At best. Sorry.

705
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.566
No.
As good as it gets.

706
00:34:27.733 --> 00:34:28.901
Okay, that sounds good,
then.

707
00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:30.069
Okay, all right.

708
00:34:30.152 --> 00:34:31.153
[Cal speaking Spanish]

709
00:34:31.236 --> 00:34:32.321
It's perfect.
Sorry.

710
00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:33.656
Coming through.

711
00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.074
Okay.

712
00:34:35.157 --> 00:34:37.868
God, you know,
it's so funny, I work
right across the street...

713
00:34:37.952 --> 00:34:39.370
and I've never been
in this place.

714
00:34:39.453 --> 00:34:40.871
Really? Where at?
Yeah.

715
00:34:40.955 --> 00:34:43.582
The
"We Sell Your Stuff On eBay"
store.

716
00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:46.085
Yes.
And that's the name?

717
00:34:46.335 --> 00:34:48.712
Yeah, I was
looking for something...

718
00:34:49.046 --> 00:34:51.799
you know, obvious.
So I chose that.

719
00:34:51.924 --> 00:34:54.093
I don't understand.
So, what, you do what?

720
00:34:54.385 --> 00:34:56.345
Well, I take the stuff
that you don't want...

721
00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:58.514
and then I "sell" it
on eBay.

722
00:34:58.597 --> 00:35:01.100
But you don't actually
sell anything in the store?

723
00:35:02.184 --> 00:35:03.769
No. I don't.

724
00:35:04.353 --> 00:35:06.438
So why do you have a store?

725
00:35:06.522 --> 00:35:07.815
I don't know.

726
00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:11.151
No, I think it's because,
you know, I wanna maybe
look professional

727
00:35:11.235 --> 00:35:14.196
and not like a crazy person
who's just gonna
steal all your shit.

728
00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:16.615
Sure. I didn't
mean anything by that.

729
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:18.158
No, it's okay.

730
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:22.037
You know what,
you should come by sometime
if you want, you know

731
00:35:22.121 --> 00:35:23.872
see it for yourself,
check it out.

732
00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:25.541
I'll check out
your empty store.

733
00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:28.836
Yeah, it's the one
across the street
that's not empty.

734
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.672
Here's my number. So...

735
00:35:32.214 --> 00:35:34.675
All right.
So, just anytime.

736
00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:38.345
Why do I need your number
if you're across the street,
though?

737
00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:42.474
I don't really have
a good answer for that, Andy.
I just...

738
00:35:42.558 --> 00:35:44.518
Sorry.
Just giving it to you.

739
00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:47.813
So I'll write you up,
and I'll meet you over
at the register.

740
00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:49.565
Okay.
And check you out...
Check out.

741
00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:50.983
Okay, see you over there.
Okay.

742
00:35:51.066 --> 00:35:52.067
Okay.

743
00:35:52.526 --> 00:35:54.611
Awful chatty.
Hey...

744
00:35:54.987 --> 00:35:57.072
Look, I think she gave me
her number.

745
00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:59.700
She wrote down her number,
but I think she gave me
her number.

746
00:35:59.783 --> 00:36:01.118
No, she gave you.
Dude, man.

747
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:02.786
See, you still mad at me?

748
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.747
No, I was never.
Right, you see what I mean?

749
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.707
Yeah, we gonna
celebrate it, man. Yeah.

750
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.208
This is pretty cool.
Yeah.

751
00:36:08.292 --> 00:36:10.210
Unbelievable.
Come on,
give him some credit, man.

752
00:36:10.294 --> 00:36:11.462
The man pulled a number.

753
00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:14.089
It's just... I was in...
I can't believe that happened.

754
00:36:14.173 --> 00:36:15.632
What you did was you zoned in.

755
00:36:15.716 --> 00:36:17.885
Man, she just gave me
her number.

756
00:36:18.177 --> 00:36:22.681
That's great, man.
I'm telling you,
love is a mysterious fig.

757
00:36:22.765 --> 00:36:23.766
It is.

758
00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:26.643
Okay, here's a question.
When should I call her?

759
00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:28.479
You like her?
Yeah.

760
00:36:28.562 --> 00:36:30.022
You definitely
don't want to call her.

761
00:36:30.105 --> 00:36:31.732
When is the next Olympics?

762
00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:33.150
(Jay)
So what you just
got to do is...

763
00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:35.110
just get you a bunch
of these hood rats...

764
00:36:35.194 --> 00:36:36.612
run through them,
just knock them out.

765
00:36:36.695 --> 00:36:37.738
Boom, boom, boom.

766
00:36:37.821 --> 00:36:40.324
And once you've done
slayed like 20,
30 of them hood rats...

767
00:36:40.407 --> 00:36:43.118
now you ready to go up
to the upper echelon type ho.

768
00:36:43.202 --> 00:36:45.204
You know what I mean?
I'm not a big ho runner.

769
00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:47.122
My uncle used to drive
a ho runner.

770
00:36:47.206 --> 00:36:49.041
Screw these analogies.
What he's saying is...

771
00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:51.126
you are going to be so bad
at sex the first time...

772
00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:53.253
you don't want to have sex
with someone you like...

773
00:36:53.337 --> 00:36:55.631
'cause they'll think
you're a weirdo for being
so lame at it.

774
00:36:55.714 --> 00:36:57.800
You want to have sex
with hood rats first...

775
00:36:57.883 --> 00:36:59.927
so that by the time
you get to the girl
you do like...

776
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.472
you're not terrible at sex,
you'll be mediocre at it.

777
00:37:03.806 --> 00:37:05.265
Probably still
pretty bad, though.

778
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:07.559
(Jay)
Let's put it up for my man
for pulling that number.

779
00:37:07.643 --> 00:37:09.978
Way to go, man.
Politicked his ass off.

780
00:37:10.062 --> 00:37:12.397
(Cal)
You did politic.
Thanks a lot.

781
00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:14.525
Like a train, round the bend.
You ready?

782

784
00:37:48.725 --> 00:37:49.726
Yeah.

785
00:37:50.853 --> 00:37:52.020
I can't.
Do it.

786
00:37:52.104 --> 00:37:53.730
I can't pee in public.
Gotta do it.

787
00:37:53.814 --> 00:37:55.399
I've got a mental block
about it.

788
00:37:55.482 --> 00:37:58.694
Come on, do it.
I'm shy!

00:38:05.868 --> 00:38:08.203
Let me out.
I can't hear
what you're saying.

792
00:38:08.287 --> 00:38:10.831
I don't want to be in here.
It's a soundproof room.

793
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.709
Just learn the techniques.

You sure?

I know.
Can I ask you something

sound weird.

Yes.

Yeah.
I think you're

anybody can see it.

Well,
that's why I'm asking you.

No. Waxing don't hurt.

not unless you're a bitch.

842
00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:38.687
That feels warm.

843
00:40:41.815 --> 00:40:44.943
(David)
I like your sweater.
Does that come in a V-neck?

844
00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:48.780
(Cal)
She starts doing his pubes,
I'm out of here.

845
00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:52.367
(Jay)
You gonna look good
after this, man.

846
00:40:52.451 --> 00:40:53.660
Thanks, man.

847
00:40:54.036 --> 00:40:55.412
So, ready?
Yeah.

848

[screaming]

850
00:41:01.501 --> 00:41:03.378
You fucker!

851
00:41:04.504 --> 00:41:07.090
I'm sorry.
That's just your job.

852
00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:10.635
You want me to stop now?
No. It's okay.

853
00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:13.388
Let's do another one.

854
00:41:13.472 --> 00:41:15.098
That one little patch
looks sexy though.

855
00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:17.225
Does it look good?
(Cal)
Yeah, it looks really good.

856
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:18.352
[exclaiming]

857
00:41:18.477 --> 00:41:20.812
(David)
It looks man-tastic.

858
00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.148
(Andy)
Okay.

859
00:41:24.775 --> 00:41:28.403
Wow! I didn't expect
that at all.
I really didn't expect that.

860
00:41:28.987 --> 00:41:31.365
(Jay)
You got it. The first one
is the only one that hurts.

861
00:41:31.448 --> 00:41:33.909
Yeah.
Those hairs are pretty deep.

862
00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:35.077
Okay.

863
00:41:35.369 --> 00:41:36.995
You ready?
Yup.

Sucker motherfucker!

867
00:41:43.001 --> 00:41:45.295
You shithead! I hate you!

868
00:41:45.379 --> 00:41:47.172
I hate you so much!

869
00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.549
That one hurt.

870
00:41:49.633 --> 00:41:51.968
That one hurt
just as much as the first one.

871
00:41:52.052 --> 00:41:54.054
That's great, man.
Man!

872
00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:55.305
[exhaling]

873
00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:58.225
One, two, three.

[grunting]

875
00:41:59.393 --> 00:42:03.397
Fuck me!

876
00:42:03.855 --> 00:42:07.359
In the asshole!

[Andy exclaiming]

878
00:42:09.528 --> 00:42:10.654
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

879
00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:12.322
I really don't
swear this much.

880
00:42:12.406 --> 00:42:13.824
You know what,
I got a weak stomach.

881
00:42:13.907 --> 00:42:15.659
That's all I can really take.
I'll see ya'll.

882
00:42:15.784 --> 00:42:18.120
(Andy)
Jay.
Be tough, Andy, you got it.

883
00:42:18.203 --> 00:42:20.288
Where did Jay go?
(David)
He went to throw up.

884
00:42:20.372 --> 00:42:21.665
Ready?
Yup.

885
00:42:22.374 --> 00:42:23.417
One, two.

887
00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:26.878
Cocksucker motherfucker!

888
00:42:27.045 --> 00:42:28.713
You pulled on two.

889
00:42:29.965 --> 00:42:31.633
Why didn't you
pull on three?

890
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:33.051
Freddy pie hole!

891
00:42:33.135 --> 00:42:34.553
[Andy exclaiming in Spanish]

892
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:36.680
No! Kelly Clarkson!

That's fucked up.

Oh, shit falls!

896
00:42:45.313 --> 00:42:46.440
That's fucked up.

897
00:42:49.443 --> 00:42:51.361
I hate you.

898
00:42:51.445 --> 00:42:53.822
Stop smiling, you jerk!

899
00:42:53.905 --> 00:42:55.073
You pussy.

900
00:42:55.157 --> 00:42:57.242
Oh, God. What's next?

901
00:42:57.617 --> 00:42:59.786
You're doing the nipple.
(Cal)
Not the nipple.

902
00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:01.663
Come on.
Not the nipple.

903
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:03.415
Please, Cal,
hold my hand.

904
00:43:03.832 --> 00:43:06.626
You kidding me, man?
Hold my goddamn hand, man.

905
00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.463
Do it! Just hold.
Okay, here we go.

00:43:09.546 --> 00:43:10.672
[exhaling]

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:11.756
(woman)
Ready?

908
00:43:12.424 --> 00:43:13.717
No. Yup.

909
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.760
One, two, three.

910
00:43:16.303 --> 00:43:18.763
[screaming]
Nipple fuck!

911
00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:22.559
Mika, you should
burn in hell!

912
00:43:23.018 --> 00:43:25.687
Okay, all right.
No, seriously,
I think I'm done.

913
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.106
I think we're done.
I think that's good.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.441
[panting]

915
00:43:30.275 --> 00:43:31.568
You know what, guys...

916
00:43:31.651 --> 00:43:34.196
this is not
a good look for me!

917
00:43:34.613 --> 00:43:36.406
You look like
a man-o'-lantern.

918
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.450
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

919
00:43:53.673 --> 00:43:54.925
[screaming]

920
00:43:58.011 --> 00:43:59.721
(Cal)
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

921
00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:01.431
Thank you.
Thanks.

922
00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.934
Andy,
I owe you an apology, man.

923
00:44:04.017 --> 00:44:07.437
I wasn't very nice
to you for the past
two-and-a-half years.

924
00:44:07.521 --> 00:44:08.647
You were nice to me.

925
00:44:08.647 --> 00:44:11.316
No, I was... I thought
you were really boring and

926
00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:13.652
I kind of thought
you were a serial killer.

927
00:44:13.735 --> 00:44:14.736
(LAUGHS)

928
00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:16.404
I'm not joking.

929
00:44:16.905 --> 00:44:19.741
Hey!
Sorry. Shoot. Sorry, sorry.

930
00:44:19.824 --> 00:44:22.160
Don't worry. There's a lot of
padding in these.

931
00:44:22.244 --> 00:44:24.579
I could hurl it
off the balcony,
it would be fine.

932
00:44:24.663 --> 00:44:26.373
Yeah. It will be fine.
We couldn't break this

933
00:44:26.456 --> 00:44:27.499
if we tried.
No problem.

934
00:44:27.582 --> 00:44:29.668
Look, you shouldn't listen
to Dave and Jay, okay?

935
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:32.837
Those guys are crazy.
You should listen to me, okay?

936
00:44:32.921 --> 00:44:35.882
Look, there is a hot-ass girl
who works right there.

937
00:44:35.966 --> 00:44:39.302
There she is,
in the bookstore.
You should ask her out, man.

938
00:44:41.263 --> 00:44:43.098
Something wrong
with her underpants.

939
00:44:43.223 --> 00:44:44.683
CAL:
Yeah, they're not in my mouth.

940
00:44:44.766 --> 00:44:46.726
You know, I kind of

941
00:44:47.936 --> 00:44:50.146
like the woman
from the eBay store.

942
00:44:50.313 --> 00:44:51.356
That's great, but

943
00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:52.691
you're not gonna
get with anyone

944
00:44:52.774 --> 00:44:54.401
unless you play
the odds on this, man.

945
00:44:54.484 --> 00:44:56.361
You need to plant
a lot of seeds.

946
00:44:56.444 --> 00:44:59.948
It's like this.
When I was growing pot,
I realized

947
00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.618
that the more seeds
I planted...
Thank you.

948
00:45:03.702 --> 00:45:05.996
...the more pot
I could ultimately smoke.

949
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:09.291
I think I have all the advice
that I can handle right now.

950
00:45:09.374 --> 00:45:10.458
Don't get bitter.

951
00:45:10.542 --> 00:45:13.378
I'm not bitter.
I almost lost a nipple, okay?

952
00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:15.255
That was Jay's idea, okay?

953
00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:17.924
And I wasn't going to
say anything,
but waxing your chest is

954
00:45:18.008 --> 00:45:20.510
like the gayest thing
you could possibly do, okay?

955
00:45:20.594 --> 00:45:24.306
Look at me.
Looks are not important.
Really look at me.

956
00:45:24.431 --> 00:45:27.350
I am ugly as fuck
by traditional standards

957
00:45:27.434 --> 00:45:29.853
but I get with women.

958
00:45:29.936 --> 00:45:32.063
Aren't you curious
as to how that's possible?

959
00:45:32.147 --> 00:45:34.357
I am not ugly as fuck.

960
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:36.234
I didn't say you were
ugly as...

961
00:45:36.318 --> 00:45:37.777
Well, you implied it.
Okay.

962
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:40.447
It doesn't matter if
you're ugly as fuck
or you're ugly as shit.

963
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.617
It's about talking to women,
and I know how to do that

964
00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:47.078
because I observe,
because I am a novelist.

965
00:45:47.746 --> 00:45:49.623
What? You never
told me that before.

966
00:45:49.706 --> 00:45:52.500
That's because I am not
an arrogant prick, Andy.

967
00:45:52.626 --> 00:45:55.003
Okay? The problem
most men have is

968
00:45:55.337 --> 00:45:56.838
they don't know
how to talk to women.

969
00:45:56.921 --> 00:46:00.634
You know what my problem is?
I am not interesting.

970
00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:03.345
What am I supposed to say?
"I went to magic camp?"

971
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.513
"I'm an accomplished
ventriloquist?"

972
00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:08.725
"I am a seventh-degree
imperial yo-yo master."

973
00:46:08.808 --> 00:46:09.768
(EXCLAIMS)

974
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:11.895
Do me, yo-yo master.

975
00:46:11.978 --> 00:46:15.774
I want you to do me,
'cause you're the yo-yo guy.

976
00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:17.317
Are you done? Listen.

977
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.319
The problem
most men have is

978
00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:22.864
they just plain straight up
have no clue
how to talk to women.

979
00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:26.326
Just ask questions, okay?
That's it.

980
00:46:26.493 --> 00:46:31.081
Because women do not care
about what you have to say
at all anyway, you know.

981
00:46:31.164 --> 00:46:33.166
And all they want to do
is talk about themselves.

982
00:46:33.249 --> 00:46:34.959
So you're just gonna
let them do that.

983
00:46:35.043 --> 00:46:36.669
Okay? So remember.

984
00:46:36.753 --> 00:46:39.964
Questions, be cool,
and be kind of a dick.

985
00:46:40.048 --> 00:46:43.176
Here, be David Caruso
in <i>Jade.</i>

986
00:46:43.676 --> 00:46:45.929
Okay. I know exactly
what you're talking about.

987
00:46:46.012 --> 00:46:47.514
You do. That's good.

988
00:46:49.224 --> 00:46:50.642
(Cal)
There she is.

989
00:46:53.478 --> 00:46:55.188
Go plant that seed, man.

990
00:46:55.814 --> 00:46:57.565
Plant it with your finger.

991
00:47:09.786 --> 00:47:11.204
Can I help you?

992
00:47:13.248 --> 00:47:14.874
I don't know. Can you?

993
00:47:16.543 --> 00:47:18.545
Are you looking
for something?

994
00:47:19.879 --> 00:47:22.549
Is there something
I should be looking for?

995
00:47:23.883 --> 00:47:25.093
[laughs]

996
00:47:26.845 --> 00:47:28.388
We have
a lot of books.

997
00:47:28.805 --> 00:47:31.891
So, maybe it depends
on what you like.

998
00:47:36.896 --> 00:47:38.398
What do you like?

999
00:47:38.648 --> 00:47:42.152
We have a great section of...

1000
00:47:42.652 --> 00:47:44.112
do-it-yourself.

1001
00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:46.573
Do you like to
"do it yourself"?

1002
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.659
Sometimes. I mean...

1003
00:47:50.243 --> 00:47:53.788
if the mood strikes.

1004
00:47:55.165 --> 00:47:57.333
How is the mood
striking you now?

1005
00:47:57.667 --> 00:47:59.085
[laughing]

1006
00:48:00.712 --> 00:48:01.921
[tittering]

1007
00:48:04.174 --> 00:48:05.633
What's your name?

1008
00:48:06.384 --> 00:48:07.552
What's your name?

1009
00:48:07.635 --> 00:48:09.721
I'm Beth.

1010
00:48:12.432 --> 00:48:13.558
Andy.

1011
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:15.935
Andy.

1012
00:48:18.605 --> 00:48:21.232
Don't tell on me,
okay, Andy?
I won't.

1013
00:48:22.942 --> 00:48:25.278
Unless you want

I would've thought
you were doing that for years.

No. That's the key.

take it out of its packaging.

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:55.817

the eyes of a woman,
you know?

1507
01:09:55.901 --> 01:09:58.236
What is she going to think
when she comes in here? Look.

1508
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.739

So what?

1509
01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:03.575
And more video games
than a teenaged Asian kid.

1510
01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.202
It's all right.

1511
01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:08.663
Is that the
<i>Six Million Dollar Man's</i> boss?

1512
01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:10.123
It's Oscar Goldman.

1513
01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:12.417
Why do you have that?
That's worth a lot of money.

1514
01:10:12.501 --> 01:10:14.461
That's much more valuable
than Steve Austin.

1515
01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:18.799
Well, that may be the case.
But none of this shit
is sexy, okay?

1518
01:10:22.344 --> 01:10:24.137
You framed an Asia poster?

1519
01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:26.223
How hard did the people
at the frame store laugh...

1520
01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.308
when you brought this in?
They did not laugh at me.

1521
01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.268

Because you like Asia.

1522

over here, okay?

1524
01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:35.315
First, you relax, okay?

1525
01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:38.693
Just stop calming me down
and tell me what I should do.

1526
01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:40.946
Okay, we just take everything
that's embarrassing...

1527
01:10:41.029 --> 01:10:42.113

1528

move in or something?

1533
01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:00.298
No. Actually I'm getting
new carpet in.

carpet underneath.

I never really go out

you're looking at.

1674
01:18:06.766 --> 01:18:09.852
Can you imagine that?
I don't want to, no.

1675
01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:13.481
Well, needless to say,
a lot of male attention.

1676
01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:14.732
Like men, yes.

1677
01:18:14.816 --> 01:18:18.820
Especially from our
Guatemalan gardener, Javier.

1678
01:18:18.987 --> 01:18:20.113
Okay.

1679
01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:22.198
You know, Javier,

1680
01:18:23.074 --> 01:18:27.870
before he made
passionate yet gentle love
to me for the first time,

1681
01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:33.334
he serenaded me with
a beautiful old Guatemalan
love song.

1682
01:18:33.418 --> 01:18:35.086
Really, that's...

1683
01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:37.839
That sounds nice.

1684
01:18:37.922 --> 01:18:39.382
(SINGING IN SPANISH)

1685
01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.325
Okay.

1686
01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:09.203
My goodness.

1687
01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:11.664
I think we better
get back to work.
Yeah.

1688
01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:14.125
Yeah, I better go
back to work.
Yeah.

1689
01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.044
So, okay.
All right.

1690
01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:17.962
So, you mull it over
and I'll talk to you soon.

1691
01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:19.922
All right, I will.
Thank you.
Okay.

1692
01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:23.051
(GASPS)

1693
01:19:25.011 --> 01:19:28.014
What's up, dawg?
What happened?
How was the date with Trish?

1694
01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:30.391
It was a disaster.
Really?

1695
01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:33.269
Yes. I've never been
more embarrassed in my life.

1696
01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:35.521
Couldn't get the
condoms to work.

1697
01:19:35.605 --> 01:19:38.357
And one of them
exploded on my balls.

1698
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.443
And then her kid
walked in the room.

1699
01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:41.527
Wait. Hold up.

1700
01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:43.029
She was hiding the kid
from you, dawg?

1701
01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.447
You know what,
it doesn't matter

1702
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:46.866
because it was going downhill
straight from there.

1703
01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.118
Listen, you don't want
no baby-daddy drama.

1704
01:19:49.202 --> 01:19:50.411
Trust me on this one,
all right?

1705
01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:52.538
For all you know,
he in prison right now.

1706
01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:53.998
Let's say y'all
living together.

1707
01:19:54.082 --> 01:19:57.043
Next thing you know,
you the one going on the
1st and the 15th

1708
01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:58.336
to pick up the
government check.

1709
01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.505
What if he got boys
that's on the outside

1710
01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:01.672
and they stalking you?

1711
01:20:01.756 --> 01:20:03.633
You see what I'm saying?
You got to think, partner...

1712
01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:05.384
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1713
01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.929
Here's what you do.
You tell her you're a virgin.

1714
01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:10.139
You test her
with this shit, okay?

1715
01:20:10.223 --> 01:20:12.975
Here, tell me. Tell me.
This is how it's gonna go.
Tell me.

1716
01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:14.852
I'm a virgin.
Sweet.

1717
01:20:15.353 --> 01:20:18.773
I like that because
you don't have chlamydia.

1718
01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.735
And I know that,
and that shit is everywhere.

1719
01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:25.071
What if she
laughs at me, though?

1720
01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:27.323
Then you punch her
in the fucking head
if she laughs.

1721
01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.951
I'm not going to
punch her in the head.
She's really sweet.

1722
01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:33.579
No. I mean, you punch her
in her fucking head
emotionally.

1723
01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:36.666
She's different. She's someone
I felt like I had

1724
01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:38.084
a connection with.

1725
01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.420
All you trying to do right now
is bust off this first nut.

1726
01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:44.006
You got a whole lot of semen
back up in you.

1727
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:45.216
I am going to tell her.

1728
01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.135
You should totally
tell her, man.
I'm going to.

1729
01:20:47.218 --> 01:20:49.428
'Cause I watched this movie
called <i>Liar Liar</i>

1730
01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:52.181
and the message was,
"Don't lie."

1731
01:20:52.265 --> 01:20:53.933
And that was a smart movie.

1732
01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:55.518
Yeah, that's the right thing.
Yeah.

1733
01:20:56.269 --> 01:21:00.189
Really? All your girlfriends
wanted to have sex
with virgins, too?

1734
01:21:00.857 --> 01:21:04.485
That's funny. I didn't
even know you girls
talked like that.

1735
01:21:05.111 --> 01:21:08.239
I think my first time
might be your best time, too.

1736
01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.449
Well, I knew it.
You know what,

1737
01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:13.619
I knew that you'd
react that way
and I knew that,

1738
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:18.374
you would want
to lead me through
my first sexual encounter

1739
01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:23.171
with all the compassion
and care that someone

1740
01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:25.047
would give to their soul mate.

1741
01:21:25.131 --> 01:21:27.008
Oh, my God. I'm in trouble.

1742
01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:31.512
Hey, Andy.

1743
01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:33.806
(Joe)
You watching <i>Survivor</i> tonight?

1744
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:36.350
No, actually
I'm going out to dinner
with somebody.

1745
01:21:36.434 --> 01:21:37.435
Hi.

1746
01:21:37.852 --> 01:21:38.895
(Andy)
This is her.

1747
01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.980
Trish, this is
Joe and Sara.
Hi.

1748
01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:42.356
Hi, Trish.
Hey.

1749
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.983
But tape it for me,
okay?

1750
01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.693
Will do. All right.
(Andy)
Thanks.

1751
01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:46.944
So long.
(Sara)
Bye-bye.

1752
01:21:47.028 --> 01:21:48.696
See you later.
Have a good night.

1753
01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:51.199
Yeah, my man's gonna
get it on tonight.

1754
01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:52.241
Yes, sir.

1755
01:21:52.325 --> 01:21:54.869
Yeah, and you better
get on me, too.

1756
01:21:55.161 --> 01:21:57.038
What is wrong
with this woman?

1757
01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:58.414
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

1758
01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:06.380
I'm so sorry that happened
the other night.

1759
01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:07.506
No, I'm sorry.

1760
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:09.258
Oh, my God.
That was me.

1761
01:22:09.342 --> 01:22:10.343
No.

1762
01:22:11.052 --> 01:22:13.763
Let me...
I have something
I want to tell you.

1763
01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:16.599
Kind of hard to talk about.

1764
01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:18.559
But...

1765
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:22.313
you know,
there are certain things...

1766
01:22:22.647 --> 01:22:25.024
about who I am that...

1767
01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:28.527
I'm sorry.
I just have to get this
off my chest.

1768
01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:31.322
I am so sorry,
I didn't tell you I had kids.

1769
01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:33.866
Yeah, what was that about?

1770
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:36.327
Gosh. You know,
that really surprised me.

1771
01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:41.082
No, you should have
told me probably, but...

1772
01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:42.166
I'm sorry. I know.

1773
01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:44.335
What do I care
if you have a kid?

1774
01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.504
Well, I have two kids.

1775
01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:49.757
Wow. Okay.
How old are they?

1776
01:22:50.758 --> 01:22:51.842
Six.

1777
01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:53.803
Sixteen.

1778
01:22:54.262 --> 01:22:55.638
Twenty-one.

1779
01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:57.848
Forty-two.

1780
01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.643
Fifty-six. How many kids
do you have?

1781
01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:02.561
I have three.
Okay, three.

1782
01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:04.605
Yeah,
and one of them
has a kid.

1783
01:23:04.689 --> 01:23:06.023
A one-year-old.

1784
01:23:06.357 --> 01:23:08.067
That's cool. That's great.

1785
01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:13.572
I'm really glad
we're doing this.
Me, too.

1786
01:23:17.952 --> 01:23:19.495
Listen, Andy...

1787
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.873
I don't want to send you
running for the hills
or anything, but...

1788
01:23:22.957 --> 01:23:27.670
I really feel like
if we decide to
do this again, then...

1789
01:23:29.797 --> 01:23:33.050
maybe we should hold off
on the physical part
for a while.

1790
01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:37.263
That is a fantastic idea.

1791
01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.515
Why didn't I think of that?

1792
01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:40.808
Really?
Totally.

1793
01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:44.186
No sex?
No. Why do that?

1794
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:46.063
Because here's the thing.

1795
01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:47.398
From personal experience...

1796
01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:50.151
I found that
sex can really
complicate things.

1797
01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:53.321
And what we should be
doing right now is
getting to know each other.

1798
01:23:53.404 --> 01:23:54.405
Yeah.

1799
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.782
Well, I never thought
you'd go for it.

1800
01:23:56.866 --> 01:23:58.242
I'm going for it.

1801
01:23:58.326 --> 01:24:01.245
Well, that just
is a great, great notion.

1802
01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:03.289
Are you serious?

1803
01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:06.167
Look at my face.
Look at how serious I am.

1804
01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:08.169
Can you see my nostrils?

1805
01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:10.087
Yes.
That's serious.

1806
01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:11.756
That's more angry.

1807
01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.425
Yeah, you know what,
most guys would be saying:

1808
01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:17.720
"Yeah," right now, but, like,
by the third date,
it would be:

1809
01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:21.349
"Hey, baby, I really need to
physically express
how I feel"...

1810
01:24:21.432 --> 01:24:23.768
and all that stuff.
Well, hey, baby...

1811
01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:26.937
you know, three dates...
Make it 10,10 dates.

1812
01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.107
How about 15?

1813
01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:33.944
Fifteen. Screw your 15.
20 dates.

1814
01:24:34.195 --> 01:24:36.280
Okay, 20 dates.
Twenty dates.

1815
01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:38.908
Okay.
This is genius.

1816
01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:40.618
It's gonna hurt.

1817
01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.622
Not as much as you think.

1818
01:24:46.332 --> 01:24:48.459
We can really get to know
each other this way.

1819
01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:49.543
Yeah.

1820
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.546
This is one, right?
No, next one.

1821
01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:55.800
[door opening]

1822
01:24:56.884 --> 01:24:57.968
[clearing throat]

1823
01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:00.388
Is it safe to come in,
or are you guys doing it?

1824
01:25:00.471 --> 01:25:02.139
Honey, it's safe.

1825
01:25:04.642 --> 01:25:05.643
Great.

1826
01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:07.395
(Trish)
Well, good timing.

1827
01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:09.397
Yeah.
(Trish)
You remember Marla.

1828
01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.400
Hi, we met.
And this is
my little bunny rabbit.

1829
01:25:12.483 --> 01:25:13.901
Julia.
Hey.

1830
01:25:13.984 --> 01:25:16.362
This is Andy.
Julia, how you doing?

1831
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:20.908
You know what,
do you by any chance
like magic?

1832
01:25:21.367 --> 01:25:23.869
Yeah.
I thought that you might.

1833
01:25:23.953 --> 01:25:25.413
Because I noticed
on the way in...

1834
01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:28.082
that you had something shiny
behind your ear.

1835
01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:30.584
Marla, did you see that?
Something behind her ear?

1836
01:25:30.668 --> 01:25:32.169
You think you do?
Could I check?

1837
01:25:32.253 --> 01:25:34.547
Do you mind if I check
behind your ear?

1838
01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.132
Big money!

1839
01:25:36.215 --> 01:25:37.216
[exclaiming]

1840
01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:40.261
That's amazing.
Wow, it is amazing.

1841
01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:42.430
There's something else, too,
behind your ear, I think.

1842
01:25:42.513 --> 01:25:45.141
No, actually it's not
behind your ear.
I think it is your ear.

1843
01:25:45.224 --> 01:25:46.225
Rip!

1844
01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:49.770
It is your ear.
There is your ear.

1845
01:25:49.854 --> 01:25:51.147
I ripped it off.

1846
01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:52.773
Gross!
Yeah, that's...

1847
01:25:52.857 --> 01:25:55.818
All right. Wait.
Okay, but that means
that you...

1848
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.863
walk around with a rubber ear
in your pocket all day?

1849
01:25:59.864 --> 01:26:01.574
Yeah, like half the time.

1850
01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:03.701
You know, I can come
to your high school...

1851
01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:05.744
and do it for your friends
if you want.

1852
01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:07.621
You know what,
I should head out.

1853
01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:09.039
Really?
Yeah.

1854
01:26:09.123 --> 01:26:11.000
I have to give you
a ride home.

1855
01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.293
Right. Yes, you do.

1856
01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:14.628
Yeah, 'cause you don't have
a car or anything, right?

1857
01:26:14.712 --> 01:26:16.255
Right, I don't have a car.

1858
01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:18.966
'Cause he doesn't have a car,
and he does magic.

1859
01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:20.384
Awesome.

1860
01:26:20.551 --> 01:26:23.137
And sarcasm is like
a second language to me.

1861
01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.306
So, I'm right there with you.

1862
01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:26.390
[laughing]

1863
01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:29.560
But, Dad,

1864
01:26:30.311 --> 01:26:33.606
I don't know how to love.

1865
01:26:34.482 --> 01:26:35.983
You never

1866
01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:40.112
taught me how...

1867
01:26:40.404 --> 01:26:41.572
(RINGING)

1868
01:26:43.449 --> 01:26:45.326
Hello.
ANDY:
Hey, Cal.

1869
01:26:45.493 --> 01:26:47.703
<i>Hey.</i>
I just got back from a date.

1870
01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.914
<i>Did you tell her
you're a virgin?</i>

1871
01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:52.374
No. I haven't gotten
to that yet.

1872
01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:54.668
Really?
Are you having sex right now?

1873
01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:57.087
<i>No. She was incredible.</i>

1874
01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:59.673
She was amazing.
She didn't pressure me.

1875
01:26:59.757 --> 01:27:02.760
And she has three kids.

1876
01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:04.845
And one of her kids
has a kid.

1877
01:27:04.929 --> 01:27:06.472
(COUGHING)

1878
01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:08.349
You all right?

1879
01:27:08.766 --> 01:27:13.020
Did you just say she has
three kids, one of whom
has a kid?

1880
01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:15.564
Yeah.
<i>So, so, she's a grandma?</i>

1881
01:27:15.773 --> 01:27:16.732
No.

1882
01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:18.567
<i>I'm not a doctor
or anything like that</i>

1883
01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:20.819
but she's a fucking grandma.

1884
01:27:21.654 --> 01:27:23.239
Yeah, whatever, you know.

1885
01:27:23.322 --> 01:27:24.698
She's the hottest grandma
I ever saw.

1886
01:27:24.782 --> 01:27:26.200
<i>Yeah, she is.
She's a hot grandma.</i>

1887
01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:29.036
That's a good-looking grandma.
My grandma looks like
Jack Palance.

1888
01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.120
<i>Well, she's no Jack Palance.</i>

1889
01:27:30.204 --> 01:27:31.914
No. If Jack Palance
looked like that lady,

1890
01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.958
I would want to
fuck Jack Palance right now.

1891
01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:35.084
<i>Yeah, me, too.</i>

1892
01:27:35.626 --> 01:27:36.752
She's a hot grandma.

1893
01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.712
<i>Heck, yeah.
No, do a grandma, man.</i>

1894
01:27:38.796 --> 01:27:41.590
You should fuck her
on her plastic-covered couch.

1895
01:27:42.341 --> 01:27:44.385
Fuck her while she watches
<i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

1896
01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:46.053
She would probably find that
very erotic.

1897
01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.346
Yeah, whatever, you know.

1898
01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:50.933
Fuck her and then have her
send you a check
for $12 on your birthday.

1899
01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.852
I'm the dude
with the hot granny.

1900
01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:57.022
(Andy)
What did you want to
talk to me about?

1901
01:27:57.106 --> 01:27:58.816
Well, Andy,
the numbers just came in...

1902
01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:02.611
and you are by far
our best salesman.

1903
01:28:02.987 --> 01:28:05.322
So, I am promoting you
to floor manager.

1904
01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:07.575
This is the bullshit
of all bullshits!

1905
01:28:07.658 --> 01:28:09.618
You scumbag! Ass kisser!

1906
01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:13.664
Thank you. That's great.

1907
01:28:13.998 --> 01:28:17.710
I understand
you have a girlfriend.
Yeah, kind of seeing somebody.

1908
01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:20.796
I'm very happy for you.
Thanks. She's great.

1909
01:28:20.921 --> 01:28:22.548
Are you still a virgin?

1910
01:28:23.674 --> 01:28:25.092
You know, I don't really...

1911
01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:27.094
talk about my personal life.
You're a virgin.

1912
01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:28.512
Yes, I am.
Yeah.

1913
01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.640
My door is always open.

1914
01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:34.018
So to speak.
Great.

1915
01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:36.895
Great. Thank you.

1916
01:28:37.396 --> 01:28:39.356
I'm very discreet.

1917
01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:44.612
But I'll haunt your dreams.

1918
01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:47.865
Okay.
Okay.

1919
01:28:48.073 --> 01:28:49.074
[sniffing]

1920
01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:54.622
Wow.

1921
01:28:56.498 --> 01:29:00.544
So who's gonna take my job?
Cal will be
taking over your job.

1922
01:29:00.628 --> 01:29:02.463
And he's interviewing people
right now...

1923
01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:03.797
for his old job.

1924
01:29:03.881 --> 01:29:05.924
So, have you ever worked
with electronics before?

1925
01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:07.134
No.
No?

1926
01:29:07.384 --> 01:29:10.596
But I have electronics
in my home.

1927
01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.643
Perfect. That's the job
pretty much.
You're very well-qualified.

1928
01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:17.811
More than these other losers.

1929
01:29:17.895 --> 01:29:18.896
[laughs]

1930
01:29:19.355 --> 01:29:21.982
I could do that...
Wait, last thing.

1931
01:29:22.066 --> 01:29:24.109
I'm also gonna need that
extended warranty on it...

1932
01:29:24.193 --> 01:29:26.528
for the price of
"on the house."

1933
01:29:28.489 --> 01:29:29.782
That I can't do.

1934
01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:32.534
Hey, don't be a Negro.
Be my nigger. All right?
Help me out.

1935
01:29:32.618 --> 01:29:34.703
Hold up.
I ain't nobody's nigger.

1936
01:29:35.663 --> 01:29:38.415
I mean, you somebody's nigger
wearing
this nigger tie.

1937
01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:40.000
Now you being condescending.

1938
01:29:40.084 --> 01:29:43.587
See, you've been warned,
all right?
Just move forward amicably.

1939
01:29:43.671 --> 01:29:45.005
Okay. Well, check this out.

1940
01:29:45.089 --> 01:29:47.174
First of all, you're throwing
too many big words at me.

1941
01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:48.967
Okay, now because
I don't understand them...

1942
01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:50.511
I'm gonna take them
as disrespect.

1943
01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:52.930
Watch your mouth,
and help me with the sale.

1944
01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:55.683
Okay, see,
now you found yourself
a nigger.

1945
01:29:55.766 --> 01:29:58.602
You were looking for a nigger?
Nigger here now. See?

1946
01:29:58.686 --> 01:30:01.980
Today's forecast:
Dark and cloudy,
and chance of drive-by.

1947
01:30:02.272 --> 01:30:04.149
You want to go?
I suggest you move back.

1948
01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:05.859
Then, nig, fire on.

1949
01:30:05.943 --> 01:30:07.236
What are we gonna do?

1950
01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:10.531
What are you gonna do,
Mr. Floor Manager?

1951
01:30:11.949 --> 01:30:13.158
Go, get them, tiger.

1952
01:30:13.242 --> 01:30:14.868
This shit just got rigged.

1953
01:30:14.952 --> 01:30:16.870
What are you gonna do, bitch?
I'll tell you what.

1954
01:30:16.954 --> 01:30:18.872
You know Luca Perry
from 20th and 25th?

1955
01:30:18.956 --> 01:30:20.707
You ever heard of,
Rolling 20s, nigger?

1956
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:23.168
Since I was 16, nigger,
I'm saying "frosty."

1957
01:30:23.252 --> 01:30:24.878
You know what I'm saying,
"spoon", nigger.

1958
01:30:24.962 --> 01:30:26.630
We fucked dwarfs in the ass.

1959
01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.632
Nigger, this dwarf here
don't got to be tall...

1960
01:30:28.715 --> 01:30:30.467
to pull the trigger off
in somebody face!

1961
01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:32.803
Come on nigger, back up.
What's up?
Hey...

1962
01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:34.096
Welcome to Smart Tech.

1963
01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:35.556
Is this your boy?
What can I help you with?

1964
01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:37.349
Yeah, nigger,
we will both mash you!

1965
01:30:37.433 --> 01:30:39.143
How can we help you, sir?
Nigger, what?

1966
01:30:39.226 --> 01:30:41.562
No, he don't need no help.
He's already been served.

1967
01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:44.523
I served him. He's taken
care of. He's a little slow,
but he got it.

1968
01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:47.276
See, what he thought was
he can come up in here
and make the rules.

1969
01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:49.736
But now he see that
Jay make the rules
at Smart Tech

1970
01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.698
that I run this bitch
and now he bought the bounce.

1971
01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:55.242
This your boy?

1972
01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:57.911
Yeah, that's my boy.
We represent Smart Tech.

1973
01:30:57.995 --> 01:30:59.413
You just got
fucked up with him.

1974
01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:02.040
Both y'all niggers going
get clapped up
when I get back.

1975
01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.334
Both of you all niggers.

1976
01:31:04.418 --> 01:31:06.545
What did I do?
It don't fucking matter!

1977
01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:09.965
Yeah, aim high, Willis.
Aim high!

1978
01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.508
Please don't do this.

1979
01:31:12.468 --> 01:31:14.470
Jay, what's going on?

1980
01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:17.931
Jill broke up with me.

1981
01:31:18.015 --> 01:31:20.517
I'm so sorry.
What happened?

1982
01:31:20.767 --> 01:31:22.853
I came home a little tipsy.

1983
01:31:23.145 --> 01:31:25.522
And I had one of my condoms
on still.

1984
01:31:27.566 --> 01:31:30.861
Woke up the next morning
and jumped in the shower
with her.

1985
01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:33.447
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1986
01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:34.740
Why did you cheat on her?

1987
01:31:34.823 --> 01:31:37.117
Because I'm insecure!
You can't tell?

1988
01:31:37.201 --> 01:31:39.578
I know, man.
It's gonna be okay.

1989
01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.788
I'm cold.
It's gonna be all right, man.

1990
01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:43.499
Seriously, man, I'm sorry.

1991
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.501
I apologize to you. I know.

1992
01:31:45.584 --> 01:31:47.419
If you wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

1993
01:31:47.503 --> 01:31:49.713
you've got to leave the sex
out of it, man. You're right.

1994
01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:50.964
It's all right. You're good.

1995
01:31:51.048 --> 01:31:52.883
I'm sorry. Come here.
I love you, man.

1996
01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:54.468
Man, I love you, too.

1997
01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:57.346
You're a good guy.

1998
01:31:59.473 --> 01:32:01.892
Do you know how I know
you guys are gay?

1999
01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:04.394
You're holding each other
ever so gently.

2000
01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:05.479
<i>Cabrón.</i>

2001
01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:08.357
[whooping]

2002
01:32:10.651 --> 01:32:11.902
[exclaiming]

2003
01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:13.070
(Trish)
Bravo.

2004
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.155
At least he can cook, Mom.

here might be
sexually inexperienced.

Okay.

Now, there are a lot
of activities that you can
engage in

2144

without having sex
that are both fun and safe.

2145
01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:32.092
What sort of activities?
I think

2146

everybody wants to know
about the activities.

2147
01:39:34.469 --> 01:39:39.057
Well,
instead of having intercourse,
you could have outer-course.

2148
01:39:39.516 --> 01:39:41.643
Outer-course?
What's that?

2149
01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:43.103
Yeah, what is that?

2150
01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:47.315
Outer-course is anything
that isn't vaginal
intercourse.

2151
01:39:47.607 --> 01:39:49.609
I prefer
vaginal intercourse.

2154
01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:56.491
Now, there are ways
of having sex
without intercourse.

2155
01:39:57.617 --> 01:40:01.037
Let's see, there are things
like body rubbing
or dry humping.

2156
01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:02.414
You could dry hump.

2157
01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:05.625
There is masturbation.
Masturbation.
Play with yourself.

2158

Mutual masturbation.
Play with a friend.

2159

Deep kissing.
There is erotic massage.

2160
01:40:11.464 --> 01:40:13.341

01:40:35.989 --> 01:40:39.242
We don't say, "tap that."
What are you talking about,
Seth?

2171
01:40:39.325 --> 01:40:41.578
You know what,
I'm a virgin, too.

2172
01:40:41.661 --> 01:40:43.204
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

2173
01:40:43.663 --> 01:40:44.748
That's...

2174
01:40:44.831 --> 01:40:46.708
We're virgins, too.
Yeah.

2175
01:40:48.668 --> 01:40:51.588
No, you know what,
it's a personal choice

2176
01:40:51.671 --> 01:40:53.214
and I don't think
it's weird at all.

2177
01:40:53.298 --> 01:40:54.549
You know what
your problem is?

2178
01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:56.342
You're putting the pussy
on a pedestal.

2179
01:40:56.426 --> 01:40:58.136
That's the second time
I've heard that.

2180
01:40:58.219 --> 01:41:00.138
What is the
"pussy on a pedestal" thing?

2181
01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:04.100
Okay, I can't listen
to anymore of this,
'cause it's making me sick.

2182
01:41:04.184 --> 01:41:05.143
So, bye.

2183
01:41:05.226 --> 01:41:07.353
You can get this information
on your website, right?

2184
01:41:07.479 --> 01:41:09.189
JUDITH:
Yes.
Thanks.
Nice meeting everybody.

2185
01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:10.398
Any other questions?

2186
01:41:10.482 --> 01:41:12.400
Do you have any
extra-large condoms?

2187
01:41:12.484 --> 01:41:14.319
Seth, you got
a tiny penis.

2188
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:18.031
(SIGHING)

2189
01:41:18.406 --> 01:41:21.534
So, I made that all up
to help you out.

2190
01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:25.163
No, you didn't.

2191
01:41:25.371 --> 01:41:28.708
But thank you
for doing that.

2192
01:41:31.586 --> 01:41:33.213
How can you tell?

2193
01:41:33.379 --> 01:41:35.799
Well, you know, I go to school
with, like, 400 guys

2194
01:41:35.882 --> 01:41:37.300
who are all trying
to have sex.

2195
01:41:37.383 --> 01:41:39.344
And, yeah,
so I can tell who's done it.

2196
01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:40.470
Of course.

2197
01:41:40.553 --> 01:41:43.473
And you really haven't?
No, I really haven't.

2198
01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:46.351
Please don't tell your mom,
okay?

2199
01:41:46.434 --> 01:41:48.186
Yeah, I won't.
Thanks.

2200
01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:51.439
But when are you
gonna tell her?

2201
01:41:51.648 --> 01:41:53.608
Believe me,
I'm working on it.

2202
01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:56.569
I am working on it.

2203
01:41:59.739 --> 01:42:00.949
Do you have any weed?

2204
01:42:02.909 --> 01:42:04.160
Yeah.
You do have some.

2205
01:42:04.244 --> 01:42:06.371
Can spare any
or is it all spoken for?

2206
01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.082
I mean, like what
are we talking? Are we...

2207
01:42:09.165 --> 01:42:11.626
Just enough to get me
baked for like a week.

2208
01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:12.919
That's a lot of weed.

2209
01:42:13.002 --> 01:42:14.921
Yeah, I am taking vacation
next week, so...

2210
01:42:15.004 --> 01:42:16.840
Where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere.

2211
01:42:16.923 --> 01:42:18.675
I'll stay in my apartment.
Just getting baked?

2212
01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:20.260
I want to be baked
the whole time.

2213
01:42:20.343 --> 01:42:22.720
Watch TV,
I'll probably re-watch <i>Gandhi.</i>

2214
01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:25.265
<i>Gandhi</i> baked is good.
Yes, isn't it?

2215
01:42:25.348 --> 01:42:26.975
I always feel bad
when I watch it baked

2216
01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:28.977
'cause I get really hungry
and I'm eating a lot

2217
01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.061
and poor Gandhi is

2218
01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:31.855
fucking starving his ass off.
Starving, I know.

2219
01:42:31.938 --> 01:42:34.440
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)</i>

2220
01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:36.985
Sounds good.
Yeah.

2221
01:42:37.068 --> 01:42:39.779
I'm going to take her
to capacity.
Are you okay with that?

2222
01:42:39.863 --> 01:42:41.197
Give it a shot.

2223
01:42:41.281 --> 01:42:43.408
Freak! Oh, yeah!

2224
01:42:45.118 --> 01:42:47.704
Michael McDonald, man,
I haven't heard this in years.

2225
01:42:47.787 --> 01:42:49.956
Yeah, I haven't heard it
in like 48 minutes.

2226
01:42:50.665 --> 01:42:53.376
If I get the set,
will you throw in the DVD?

2227
01:42:53.459 --> 01:42:55.753
You don't get the set.
I'll throw in the DVD.

2228
01:42:56.254 --> 01:42:57.297
I'll take it.

2229
01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.173
Really?
Yeah.

2230
01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.260
Y'all want to see
something beautiful?
Come here.

2231
01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:05.513
You want to see the most
beautiful thing in the world?
Check this out.

2232
01:43:05.597 --> 01:43:09.309
This is my baby right here.
That's my baby's dick
right there.

2233
01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:11.686
Looks like a poltergeist.

2234
01:43:11.978 --> 01:43:13.271
That is his foot.

2235
01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:15.690
Look at his dick.
That's not even four months.

2236
01:43:15.773 --> 01:43:17.066
Extrapolate that.

2237
01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:19.527
By the time he's 30,
what's gonna happen?

2238
01:43:19.611 --> 01:43:21.863
Yo, Andy! Come check this out,
dawg.

2239
01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:24.532
Is this the movie about babies
that are geniuses?

2240
01:43:24.616 --> 01:43:27.076
No, this is my child, dude.
Jill is pregnant.

2241
01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.286
That's yours?
(Jay)
Yeah.

2242
01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:30.371
That's why she broke up
with me in the first place...

2243
01:43:30.455 --> 01:43:32.707
'cause she just thought
that I wouldn't be
a good father...

2244
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:35.084
in light of the fact that
I'd be cheating on her
all the time.

2245
01:43:35.168 --> 01:43:36.878
But she got over all that.
It's cool now.

2246
01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:38.880
Congratulations, man.
That is great.

2247
01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:40.715
We having
a party tonight, Andy...

2248
01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:42.342
and I really want you
to be there, man.

2249
01:43:42.425 --> 01:43:44.886
We celebrating and I
really, really want you
to be there.

2250
01:43:44.969 --> 01:43:47.472
It looks like
the Doppler radar.

2251
01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:48.598
Can you believe that?

2252
01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:50.308
This child
ain't even four months old.

2253
01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:52.644
He ain't four months old yet.
Look at what he's packing.

2254
01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:55.229
Everybody dick looks big
on 60-inch TV.

2255
01:43:55.313 --> 01:43:57.899
My sister's dick looks big
on TV, okay?

2256
01:43:58.858 --> 01:44:01.527
Oh, my God,
this guy, Eric Gilliland...

2257
01:44:01.986 --> 01:44:04.572
he has bought, like,
15 of these.
Really?

2258
01:44:04.656 --> 01:44:07.617
Yeah, I think he likes
action figures even more
than you.

2259
01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:10.244
That is impossible.
I think so.

2260
01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.415
Andy, the way these things
are flying off your shelf...

2261
01:44:14.499 --> 01:44:17.460
you know, I think you
could actually make like...

2262
01:44:17.961 --> 01:44:19.504
maybe like $100,000.

2263
01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:21.756
Really?
Yeah,
you could open your store.

2264
01:44:21.839 --> 01:44:23.216
Wow.
Honey...

2265
01:44:23.341 --> 01:44:25.510
That's a lot of money.
I know.

2266
01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:28.262
That's incredible.
I wouldn't have done it
without you.

2267
01:44:28.346 --> 01:44:29.514
Thanks.

2268
01:44:30.181 --> 01:44:33.017
And that's not the only
good news.
What?

2269
01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:36.396
You know what tonight is?
<i>Survivor</i> is on?

2270
01:44:37.689 --> 01:44:39.232
No.
I know.

2271
01:44:39.857 --> 01:44:42.402
Is it <i>The Apprentice?</i>

2272
01:44:43.361 --> 01:44:44.362
No.

2273
01:44:45.196 --> 01:44:46.197
What?

2274
01:44:48.908 --> 01:44:53.246
It's our 20th date.

2275
01:44:59.794 --> 01:45:01.212
Wow.
Yeah.

2276
01:45:01.295 --> 01:45:02.630
Really?
Uh-huh.

2277
01:45:02.714 --> 01:45:05.967
Seriously?
I think we're at 18.

2278
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:07.760
'Cause there were
a couple of dates there...

2279
01:45:07.885 --> 01:45:09.721
that don't really count
as dates.
No.

2280
01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:12.473
I'll give you a free pass
on those other ones.

2281
01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:14.642
Thank you.

2282
01:45:14.726 --> 01:45:15.852
Listen.
What?

2283
01:45:15.935 --> 01:45:17.186
Listen.
Mmm-hmm.

2284
01:45:18.688 --> 01:45:20.314
I really like you.

2285
01:45:26.279 --> 01:45:28.072
I think I'm falling for you.

2286
01:45:28.906 --> 01:45:32.702
I don't know. I kind of see
this going somewhere.

2287
01:45:33.036 --> 01:45:34.245
I do, too.

2288
01:45:34.328 --> 01:45:37.540
I just think we should just
go crazy on each other.

2289
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:40.752
Okay.
Okay?

2290
01:45:41.627 --> 01:45:42.920
Oh, thank God!

2291
01:45:45.715 --> 01:45:46.716
Oh!

2292
01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:49.802
Okay, I should...
I gotta pick those up.

2293
01:45:49.886 --> 01:45:51.012
Don't pick them up now.

2294
01:45:51.095 --> 01:45:52.388
No, I have to pick those up
right now.

2295
01:45:52.472 --> 01:45:54.557
Wait, we'll get them later.
Listen, no, I can't, no.

2296
01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.267
Listen, it's really important
because...

2297
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:58.603
once the integrity of the box
gets compromised...

2298
01:45:58.686 --> 01:46:00.980
This is original packaging
and that's why these things...

2299
01:46:01.064 --> 01:46:03.149
are so valuable.
So you don't screw with that.

2300
01:46:03.274 --> 01:46:05.276
You really don't screw
with that.
All right.

2301
01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:07.403
We can wrap them again later,
you know.

2302
01:46:07.487 --> 01:46:08.863
Yeah, I know.
But you know what...

2303
01:46:08.946 --> 01:46:11.032
this is very important
that we don't lose
the value...

2304
01:46:11.115 --> 01:46:12.450
and compromise
the integrity of it.

2305
01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:14.744
Andy, I'm throwing myself
at you and...

2306
01:46:14.827 --> 01:46:16.871
all you can think about
is a fucking toy.

2307
01:46:16.954 --> 01:46:20.041
They're not fucking toys!
This is Iron Man, okay?

2308
01:46:20.124 --> 01:46:22.543
I got this
when I was in second grade.

2309
01:46:22.752 --> 01:46:25.421
Do you know how hard it is
for a kid to not open that?

2310
01:46:25.505 --> 01:46:26.714
This is important.

2311
01:46:26.798 --> 01:46:28.091
These are my things...

2312
01:46:28.174 --> 01:46:31.469
and you are trying to make me
sell them and I don't want to.

2313
01:46:31.552 --> 01:46:32.887
No.
And you're making me.

2314
01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:35.056
I'm not making...
You are encouraging me...

2315
01:46:35.139 --> 01:46:37.266
to quit my job.
I'm not! I'm not trying to...

2316
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:40.061
You want me to open a store.
You want me
to sell everything.

2317
01:46:40.144 --> 01:46:41.896
You know what,
I'm gonna tell you something.

2318
01:46:41.979 --> 01:46:45.191
I don't just change like that.
I can't just change for you.

2319
01:46:45.274 --> 01:46:48.069
I don't... I'm not trying
to change you. I like you.

2320
01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:50.279
I'm just... I'm trying
to help you grow up, Andy.

2321
01:46:50.363 --> 01:46:52.031
Well, thanks a lot.

2322
01:46:52.115 --> 01:46:56.119
I mean, my God,
you ride a bicycle
to work in a stockroom.

2323
01:46:56.202 --> 01:46:58.538
You know what, I'm not
in the stockroom anymore.

2324
01:46:58.621 --> 01:47:00.081
I'm a floor manager.
Okay.

2325
01:47:00.164 --> 01:47:03.209
And I ride a bike
because I like to.
Einstein rode a bike.

2326
01:47:03.292 --> 01:47:06.003
He had a wife who he fucked,
by the way.

2327
01:47:06.671 --> 01:47:08.923
What do I have to do
for you to have sex with me?

2328
01:47:09.006 --> 01:47:11.509
Do you want me to dress up
like Thor?
I'll dress up like Thor.

2329
01:47:11.592 --> 01:47:13.177
I'll dress up like Iron Man.

2330
01:47:13.261 --> 01:47:14.971
What do they do?
I'll do it.

2331
01:47:15.054 --> 01:47:16.931
What? Everything's always
about sex.

2332
01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:18.599
