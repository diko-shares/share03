00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.914
Hey, Andy! What's up, dude?

2
00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:01.125
Hey, Joe. Hey, Sara. How you doing?

3
00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:02.335
When you going to get a car?

4
00:02:02.418 --> 00:02:05.630
-Hey, why don't you get a car?
-I can't afford it.

5
00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:11.135
-So, <i>Survivor</i> tomorrow night. We on?
-See you then.

6
00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:13.012
I'll bring a soda.
Hey, enjoy your orange.

7
00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:15.264
-Okay, take care.
-See you. Bye-bye.

8
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.935
-That guy needs to get laid.
-Tell me something I don't know.

9
00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:37.495
Good morning.

10
00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:45.169
Excuse me. Pardon me.

11
00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:47.630
Sorry.

12
00:02:56.722 --> 00:02:58.432
Excuse me. Thank you.

13
00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:03.270
-Good morning.
-Hey.

14
00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:05.439
-Good morning, Paula.
-Andy.

15
00:03:07.108 --> 00:03:09.360
Excuse me. I have a question.

16
00:03:09.902 --> 00:03:14.782
What is the difference between
Hi8 and Digital video tapes?

17
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:17.451
I'm not a salesman,
so, I could probably...

18
00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:20.329
Welcome to Smart Tech.
How can I be of service to you?

19
00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:21.872
Well, I was just wondering

20
00:03:21.956 --> 00:03:24.458
what is the difference
between these?

21
00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:28.212
Well, if I'm photographing someone
as fine as yourself,

22
00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:30.047
I'd probably go Digital.

23
00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:46.147
-My God. Sorry I'm late, man.
-No problem.

24
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:48.524
Oh, man.

25
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.610
-I had a weekend.
-Yeah?

26
00:03:51.986 --> 00:03:55.030
We went to Tijuana, Mexico,
you know,

27
00:03:55.114 --> 00:03:58.033
and we thought it would be fun,
you know, to go to this show.

28
00:03:58.117 --> 00:04:00.411
Everyone's, "You gotta
check out one of these shows."

29
00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:03.038
And, you know,
it's a woman fucking a horse.

30
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.584
We get there, and, you know,
we think it's gonna be awesome

31
00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:10.045
and it is not as cool
as it sounds like it would be, man.

32
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.590
-It's kind of gross.
-Yeah.

33
00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:14.341
You think,
"A woman fucking a horse,"

34
00:04:14.425 --> 00:04:16.010
and you get there and it's

35
00:04:16.093 --> 00:04:17.928
-a woman fucking a horse.
-Yeah.

36
00:04:18.012 --> 00:04:20.014
It was really giving it to her.

37
00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:21.432
And you know what,

38
00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:24.143
to be honest, I felt bad for her.
We all just felt bad for her.

39
00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:25.895
-Yeah.
-Kind of felt bad for the horse.

40
00:04:25.978 --> 00:04:29.190
-Wow, that's something.
-So what did you get up to?

41
00:04:30.024 --> 00:04:33.319
You know, I just kind of hung out.
I was...

42
00:04:33.903 --> 00:04:35.279
God, Friday, when I went home,

43
00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:37.615
I really wanted
an egg-salad sandwich.

44
00:04:37.698 --> 00:04:39.700
And I was just obsessing about it
and I was like,

45
00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:41.786
"Man, I'm gonna make one of those."

46
00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:45.331
So Saturday I went out
and I got, like, a dozen eggs

47
00:04:45.414 --> 00:04:48.000
and I boiled them all
and then I just,

48
00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:51.045
I spent, I don't know,
probably three hours,

49
00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:54.715
like, three-and-a-half hours making,

50
00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:58.844
you know, the mayonnaise
and the onions and paprika

51
00:04:58.928 --> 00:05:01.138
and, you know, all the accoutrements.

52
00:05:01.222 --> 00:05:02.515
And then, by the time I was done

53
00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:04.058
I just really didn't feel
like eating it.

54
00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:06.727
-I can imagine.
-And I didn't have any bread.

55
00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:10.731
So, you know, it was pretty good.
It was a good weekend.

56
00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:13.859
-Sounds pretty awesome.
-Yeah, it was fine.

57
00:05:13.943 --> 00:05:15.361
Sounds really fun.

58
00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:17.863
-Cool.
-Cool.

59
00:05:17.947 --> 00:05:19.365
Cool, cool.

60
00:05:22.368 --> 00:05:24.036
-Hey, Paula.
-Yeah.

61
00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:26.622
I gotta tell you something.
I'm really excited about it.

62
00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:30.084
For the first time today,
I woke up,

63
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:34.505
I came to the store, and
I feel confident to say to you

64
00:05:34.713 --> 00:05:37.174
that if you don't take
this Michael McDonald DVD

65
00:05:37.258 --> 00:05:39.635
that you've been playing
for two years straight, off,

66
00:05:39.718 --> 00:05:41.387
I'm going to kill everyone
in the store

67
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.347
and put a bullet in my brain.

68
00:05:43.764 --> 00:05:47.142
-David, what do you suggest we play?
-I don't care. Anything.

69
00:05:47.393 --> 00:05:50.187
I would rather watch
<i>Beautician and the Beast</i>.

70
00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:52.857
I would rather listen
to Fran Drescher for eight hours

71
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.692
than have to listen
to Michael McDonald.

72
00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:57.987
Nothing against him, but if I hear
<i>Yah Mo B There</i> one more time

73
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.489
I'm gonna yah mo burn this place
to the ground.

74
00:06:00.573 --> 00:06:03.450
You're such a smart ass.
Get back on the floor.

75
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:06.954
Fuck you.

76
00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.916
This is a great TV.
Nothing beats a plasma.

77
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.585
What are you doing?
That's my customer.

78
00:06:12.668 --> 00:06:15.880
It certainly is not. When I came
upon her, she was unattended.

79
00:06:15.963 --> 00:06:17.590
-No, that's my...
-Wait.

80
00:06:17.673 --> 00:06:19.717
Go to the checkout there.
Pick up there, please.

81
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.594
She was unattended
because I went to the back

82
00:06:21.677 --> 00:06:23.470
to get the brochure
that she requested.

83
00:06:23.554 --> 00:06:26.640
I apologize, but it's too late.
The transaction has been completed.

84
00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:28.434
Then you're gonna give me
half the commission.

85
00:06:28.517 --> 00:06:29.977
You'll receive
none of the commission.

86
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.520
I need to talk to Paula.
This is crazy.

87
00:06:31.604 --> 00:06:32.605
This is bullshit.

88
00:06:32.688 --> 00:06:34.565
Every time I make a sale,
you go crying to Paula.

89
00:06:34.648 --> 00:06:37.902
How about Jesse Jackson?
Old Jesse needs a cause.

90
00:06:37.985 --> 00:06:41.113
-Sick of you poaching my customers.
-I'm sick of your crybaby bullshit.

91
00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:44.199
You wanna take this shit outside?
Just take it outside and squash it?

92
00:06:44.283 --> 00:06:47.536
Let's stay inside, so everybody can
see what a pussy you have, okay?

93
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.081
Because when I remove the blade
I keep in my boot from its sheath

94
00:06:51.165 --> 00:06:53.959
I can't return it
until it has spilled blood.

95
00:06:54.043 --> 00:06:57.338
Look, listen to me. You are fucking
with the wrong nigger.

96
00:06:57.922 --> 00:07:01.300
Hey! You're fucking
with the wrong sand-nigger, okay?

97
00:07:01.383 --> 00:07:03.886
Dude, I will hang your old ass
by your turban.

98
00:07:04.178 --> 00:07:07.139
Turban now?
Do you see any fucking turban here?

99
00:07:07.222 --> 00:07:08.891
Do I talk like a turban guy?

100
00:07:08.974 --> 00:07:11.852
Do I say, "Hey, Jay, do you want
a Slurpee? You want a Slurpee?"

101
00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:15.147
Fuck you, okay?
I was born in Brooklyn.

102
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.273
Brooklyn, okay?

103
00:07:16.357 --> 00:07:19.944
My accent is a fucking
Brooklyn accent, okay? Okay?

104
00:07:20.027 --> 00:07:21.362
All right, man. Calm down, dude.

105
00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:23.614
Look, you still covering
my shift on Friday or what?

106
00:07:23.697 --> 00:07:26.617
If I can keep this commission,
with pleasure.

107
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.536
-Cool, then. All right, pop.
-No problem.

108
00:07:32.498 --> 00:07:34.166
-How about Andy?
-No.

109
00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:36.210
Come on, man.
We need, what, five guys

110
00:07:36.293 --> 00:07:37.795
-to play a decent poker game, right?
-Yeah.

111
00:07:37.878 --> 00:07:39.296
If we cancel this,
I'm gonna have to go

112
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.215
to some stupid-ass
birthday party with Jill

113
00:07:41.298 --> 00:07:42.633
and that shit ain't happening.

114
00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:44.218
-No.
-Why not?

115
00:07:44.385 --> 00:07:48.097
"Cause he's a really nice guy
and all, but I'm pretty sure that

116
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.515
he is a serial murderer.

117
00:07:49.598 --> 00:07:51.308
Who cares, man? He's a nice guy.

118
00:07:51.392 --> 00:07:53.686
I just wanna get drunk, fucked up,
and play some cards.

119
00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:55.896
That's great. Look, I don't wanna
end up a lampshade

120
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.982
in some creepy apartment,
that's what I'm saying.

121
00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:00.109
I don't really see
any other options.

122
00:08:00.192 --> 00:08:02.736
Andy. My man.

123
00:08:03.737 --> 00:08:05.572
You got any plans later on tonight?

124
00:08:05.656 --> 00:08:07.866
Why, do we have to unload
the Sony truck?

125
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.036
No, the guys are getting together,
we're playing some poker,

126
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.330
thought, you know, you'd wanna play.

127
00:08:13.414 --> 00:08:14.665
With you guys?

128
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.752
Yeah, sure. That would be cool.

129
00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:22.214
-You know how to play, right?
-Yeah, I play online sometimes.

130
00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:24.591
-We're gonna play in the store.
-Great.

131
00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:26.260
Are we allowed to do that?

132
00:08:26.343 --> 00:08:27.970
-Absolutely not.
-Yeah.

133
00:08:28.178 --> 00:08:29.179
Oh.

134
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.557
Well, so I'm gonna go tell Paula.

135
00:08:32.558 --> 00:08:33.976
I'm just kidding.

136
00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.937
I'm kidding. That sounds great.
Cool, I'll see you guys tonight.

137
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:38.022
-10:00?
-All right.

138
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.232
Oops.

139
00:08:41.984 --> 00:08:43.944
-I almost feel guilty.
-No, you don't.

140
00:08:58.459 --> 00:08:59.877
Going down!

141
00:09:00.502 --> 00:09:02.296
Going down!

142
00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:04.131
Dumbass.

143
00:09:04.465 --> 00:09:05.966
And a full house.

144
00:09:06.383 --> 00:09:07.885
-Oh, my dukes!
-What?

145
00:09:08.135 --> 00:09:10.179
How much fucking online poker
do you play, dawg?

146
00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:13.515
For like an hour or two a night,
when I'm not playing Halo.

147
00:09:13.849 --> 00:09:16.310
Why did you invite this guy?
He's a fucking ringer, man.

148
00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:17.561
This is hog shit.

149
00:09:17.644 --> 00:09:19.855
You, you're a fucking asshole
to tell me to come here.

150
00:09:19.938 --> 00:09:21.732
You tell me he was a nice guy,
didn't you?

151
00:09:21.815 --> 00:09:24.151
Well, fuck you people.
Fuck you, you, and you.

152
00:09:24.234 --> 00:09:27.237
Fuck and kiss
my big brown fucking ass, okay?

153
00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:28.655
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

154
00:09:28.739 --> 00:09:29.782
-Peace.
-All right, man.

155
00:09:29.865 --> 00:09:31.075
Fuck a goat.

156
00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:34.161
-Good night.
-I love that guy.

157
00:09:34.244 --> 00:09:37.164
Dude, you totally...
Ohh, shit, I gotta go. Damn.

158
00:09:37.289 --> 00:09:38.916
About to go see Ellen
in a little bit.

159
00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:40.459
Going now? Late-night action, huh?

160
00:09:40.542 --> 00:09:41.627
Dude, you know how it goes.

161
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.213
Does your girlfriend know about
all these late-night visits?

162
00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:45.756
It's like an unspoken agreement.
Yeah.

163
00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:49.093
It's like a completely and utterly
unspoken agreement.

164
00:09:49.176 --> 00:09:51.345
If you knew her, if you knew
who I was dealing with,

165
00:09:51.428 --> 00:09:52.554
you wouldn't be saying this shit.

166
00:09:52.638 --> 00:09:54.389
There's nothing you can't do
with this woman,

167
00:09:54.473 --> 00:09:56.517
straight up and down.
I've done every single thing

168
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.602
I could possibly create.
I've literally lubed up

169
00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:00.979
and made love to the arches
of her feet. All right.

170
00:10:01.063 --> 00:10:02.106
-Wow!
-Yeah.

171
00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:04.066
-Foot fuck!
-That's sick, man.

172
00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:05.776
-Wow.
-That is not sick.

173
00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:07.986
- I will give you sick.
-Oh, shit.

174
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.864
I was sleeping with a woman
recently, she had the...

175
00:10:10.989 --> 00:10:14.284
-Her tits were unbelievable.
-Oh, man, I love titties.

176
00:10:14.785 --> 00:10:17.412
And so we're doing it
and I'm about to finish

177
00:10:17.538 --> 00:10:19.581
-and her dog starts licking my ass.
-Oh, dude, why...

178
00:10:19.665 --> 00:10:24.044
I swear to God, I have to decide,
do I finish or do I stop the dog?

179
00:10:24.128 --> 00:10:25.796
I know your nasty ass. He finished.

180
00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:28.423
I finished.
And then I stole the dog.

181
00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:31.135
No, I didn't, but...

182
00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:34.012
You know, sometimes,
Amy and I would make love

183
00:10:34.096 --> 00:10:36.265
till it was almost like
we weren't two people

184
00:10:36.348 --> 00:10:38.976
but we were two spirits
or something.

185
00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:42.312
Our souls were connected
in this way, I can't describe it.

186
00:10:42.396 --> 00:10:45.649
Time stood still. It was like
we were sharing the same heart.

187
00:10:45.732 --> 00:10:49.736
Stop, man! Why do you always come
and Kill the vibe with those things?

188
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.572
"Sharing the same heart,"
that's like some

189
00:10:51.822 --> 00:10:53.323
Britney Spears shit, man.

190
00:10:53.407 --> 00:10:55.826
This is three grown ass men,
don't nobody want to hear that shit.

191
00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:58.287
Yeah, man, come on,
nobody wants to hear that shit.

192
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.998
Thank you, Andy.
Dude, you broke up two years ago.

193
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:03.458
-You get over it at some point.
-Two years, man.

194
00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:05.085
You need to get past that

195
00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:08.422
because no ass
is worth thinking that much about,

196
00:11:08.589 --> 00:11:09.840
I always say.

197
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.508
Andy, do me a favor.

198
00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:15.304
Would you please help him redeem
himself by telling a real sex story?

199
00:11:15.387 --> 00:11:16.430
Yes.

200
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:20.767
I don't, you know what,
I'm a gentleman and I don't...

201
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.644
I don't kiss and tell.

202
00:11:22.811 --> 00:11:26.356
Fuck it, I raise you.
Nastiest shit you've ever done.

203
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.816
I'm talking about nasty.

204
00:11:29.484 --> 00:11:30.527
Wow.

205
00:11:30.652 --> 00:11:33.280
So many stories are
running through my head right now.

206
00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:37.201
I dated this girl

207
00:11:37.618 --> 00:11:41.205
for a while,
and she was really a nasty freak.

208
00:11:41.455 --> 00:11:46.376
She just loved to get down
with sex all the time.

209
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.879
She was like, any time of day,
she was like,

210
00:11:48.962 --> 00:11:51.715
"Yeah, let's go. I'm so nasty."

211
00:11:51.798 --> 00:11:53.091
And I'd be nailing her.

212
00:11:53.175 --> 00:11:54.384
-Oh, shit.
-She'd be like,

213
00:11:54.468 --> 00:11:56.845
"Oh, you're nailing me. Cool."

214
00:11:57.095 --> 00:12:00.515
-She talk dirty to you?
-She loved to dirty-talk.

215
00:12:01.183 --> 00:12:03.393
Totally into it. She'd be like,

216
00:12:03.477 --> 00:12:08.482
"Yeah, let's screw, let's...
I wanna fuck."

217
00:12:09.483 --> 00:12:11.109
God, it was so dirty.

218
00:12:11.568 --> 00:12:15.656
She'd be like, "Me so horny,
me love you long time."

219
00:12:15.948 --> 00:12:16.949
So...

220
00:12:17.032 --> 00:12:19.910
-So what were the titties like?
-Yeah, describe her...

221
00:12:19.993 --> 00:12:22.120
Yeah, she had great tits.

222
00:12:22.246 --> 00:12:25.374
No, I mean like, detailed.
Did she have, like, you know,

223
00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:27.251
-them little pink teeny nipples.
-Oh, yeah.

224
00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:29.795
Or like the long
<i>National Geographic</i> nipples.

225
00:12:29.878 --> 00:12:32.422
You have like the bumpy Braille
nipples, the Stevie Wonders.

226
00:12:32.506 --> 00:12:33.882
Yeah, they were nice.

227
00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:37.427
You know, when you, like, you grab
a woman's breast and it's...

228
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:39.721
And you feel it and

229
00:12:40.514 --> 00:12:44.518
it feels like a bag of sand
when you're touching it.

230
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:47.187
Bag of sand?

231
00:12:49.523 --> 00:12:51.441
You know what I mean.
Why don't we just play?

232
00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:53.151
Why don't you just deal the cards?

233
00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:54.861
What are you talking about?

234
00:12:54.945 --> 00:12:56.989
Have you ever felt
a breast before, man?

235
00:12:57.072 --> 00:12:58.073
Yes.

236
00:12:58.156 --> 00:13:00.701
-Dude, are you gay?
-No, I'm not gay.

237
00:13:00.784 --> 00:13:02.411
I've been with tons of women.

238
00:13:02.494 --> 00:13:04.496
I touched a guy's balls
at Hebrew school once.

239
00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:06.581
Dude, it's not a big deal.
You like to fuck guys.

240
00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:09.376
I'm cool. I got friends
who fuck guys, in jail.

241
00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:10.711
No, I'm not gay.

242
00:13:10.794 --> 00:13:13.797
No, I've borked a lot of women
in my day.

243
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.132
You've "borked"?

244
00:13:15.215 --> 00:13:18.051
Hold up. Yo, answer this question:

245
00:13:19.052 --> 00:13:20.429
Are you a virgin?

246
00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:23.390
Are you a virgin?

247
00:13:23.557 --> 00:13:25.809
Yeah, not since I was 10.

248
00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:28.437
It all makes sense. You're a virgin.

249
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.023
-I am... Shut up.
-How does that happen?

250
00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:32.524
He's a fucking virgin.

251
00:13:32.607 --> 00:13:35.902
I knew it. That makes so much
sense, man. Look, he's a virgin.

252
00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:38.447
-You guys are hilarious.
-All right, come on, don't be mean.

253
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.449
I'm not being mean.
I'm trying to help the partner out.

254
00:13:40.532 --> 00:13:42.117
I'm trying to say
I wanna get you laid, dude.

255
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.493
I understand what's going on.

256
00:13:43.577 --> 00:13:46.413
You guys are so up your asses.

257
00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:50.042
From now on, your dick is my dick.
I'm getting you some pussy.

258
00:14:00.427 --> 00:14:04.848
A bag of sand! Come on, man!
You could do better than that.

259
00:14:05.349 --> 00:14:08.810
God, me so horny? Me so stupid!

260
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.443
Oh, come on.

261
00:14:19.654 --> 00:14:22.199
It's gonna be fine.
They don't even remember.

262
00:14:22.282 --> 00:14:24.034
Those guys are cool.

263
00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:33.335
This is gonna be bad.

264
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:36.129
Yeah, well,
virgin's not a dirty word.

265
00:14:36.213 --> 00:14:37.923
You know what's a dirty word,
is asshole,

266
00:14:38.006 --> 00:14:39.758
and that's what you guys are.

267
00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:43.637
You know, I may not have had sex,
but I could fuck you up.

268
00:14:45.138 --> 00:14:46.139
Yeah.

269
00:14:51.728 --> 00:14:52.979
Come on.

270
00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:57.943
-Hey, David.
-Hey, Andy.

271
00:15:01.113 --> 00:15:03.156
-What's up?
-Cal, good morning.

272
00:15:08.537 --> 00:15:09.996
-Hey, Andy.
-Hey.

273
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.416
We're gonna have to get you
some punani.

274
00:15:14.584 --> 00:15:17.963
Andy, it's going down, partner.
We're gonna be...

275
00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:22.384
This for you, partner, this for you.

276
00:15:22.467 --> 00:15:25.470
Waves will be coming at you
on Friday, Saturday.

277
00:15:25.554 --> 00:15:27.806
By Sunday,
your nuts gonna be drained.

278
00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:32.060
Hey, Andy, don't let him bother you.
It's okay not to have sex.

279
00:15:32.727 --> 00:15:34.521
Not everybody is a pussy magnet.

280
00:15:34.729 --> 00:15:38.733
-You are... What are you? 25?
-I'm 40.

281
00:15:38.817 --> 00:15:41.403
Holy shit, man.
You've got to get on that.

282
00:15:41.611 --> 00:15:45.866
Life isn't about sex.
Life is about children and passion.

283
00:15:46.283 --> 00:15:47.284
Yeah.

284
00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:49.327
-And spirit.
-Yeah, life's about passion.

285
00:15:49.411 --> 00:15:51.997
It's not about fucking
and balls and pussy.

286
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.375
It's about love. It's about people.

287
00:15:56.293 --> 00:15:58.920
-It's about connection.
-It's all about connections.

288
00:15:59.004 --> 00:16:03.175
It's not about cock and ass
and tits and butthole pleasures.

289
00:16:03.258 --> 00:16:04.926
It's not about
butthole pleasures at all.

290
00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:08.263
It's not about this rusty trombone
and dirty Sanchez.

291
00:16:08.388 --> 00:16:11.349
-Please stop.
-And Cincinnati bowtie.

292
00:16:11.683 --> 00:16:16.229
And your pussy juice cocktail
and this shit-stained balls.

293
00:16:16.313 --> 00:16:17.814
-Mooj, just please stop.
-Just relax.

294
00:16:17.898 --> 00:16:20.192
All right.
That's enough, party's over.

295
00:16:20.484 --> 00:16:22.194
Let the virgin get back to work.

296
00:16:26.448 --> 00:16:27.574
Andy!

297
00:16:27.908 --> 00:16:30.410
Andy, come on. We were just kidding.

298
00:16:30.702 --> 00:16:31.745
Pointless.

299
00:16:31.828 --> 00:16:34.122
Andy, nobody cares
that you're a virgin.

300
00:16:34.206 --> 00:16:36.041
Don't be such a baby.

301
00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:38.460
They were just having fun.
They didn't mean anything.

302
00:16:38.543 --> 00:16:40.295
-Get away from me, David.
-Wait a minute.

303
00:16:40.378 --> 00:16:42.255
-Stop following me!
-Hold up.

304
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.551
Whoa, whoa.

305
00:16:46.635 --> 00:16:47.969
I'm gonna have to quit my job now.

306
00:16:48.053 --> 00:16:49.095
You don't have to quit your job.

307
00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:51.014
You know what,
I don't wanna go out with you guys.

308
00:16:51.097 --> 00:16:52.390
-Fine.
-Okay? I don't need your help.

309
00:16:52.474 --> 00:16:54.976
Okay, fine, you don't have to go out
with us if you don't want.

310
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.604
You know what,
I respect women, I love women.

311
00:16:57.938 --> 00:17:01.274
I respect them so much that
I completely stay away from them.

312
00:17:01.525 --> 00:17:03.777
-Okay.
-I have a very fulfilling life.

313
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:11.368
And now, I am making
your silver pants blue.

314
00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.371
Get some roadburn, come on!

315
00:17:14.663 --> 00:17:16.831
Come on, sucker!

316
00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:20.252
<i>Now, pretty ladies
around the world</i>

317
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.462
<i>Got a weird thing to show you</i>

318
00:17:22.629 --> 00:17:25.757
Oh, my God!

319
00:17:29.636 --> 00:17:32.430
Hey, Will and Grace, back to work.

320
00:17:32.597 --> 00:17:34.558
Hey, Haziz,
can you just give us a second?

321
00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:36.643
We're just kind of
in the middle of something.

322
00:17:37.227 --> 00:17:38.937
I'm on my break, okay?

323
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.439
Fuck off, Haziz.
Leave us alone, all right?

324
00:17:41.523 --> 00:17:43.608
-Fuck off? Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

325
00:17:43.692 --> 00:17:45.610
-Fuck you! Fuck off.
-Fuck off.

326
00:17:45.694 --> 00:17:47.320
I'm gonna kick you
in the nuts, asshole.

327
00:17:47.404 --> 00:17:50.699
Hey, hey! Watch the language, okay?
I have a family.

328
00:17:50.782 --> 00:17:51.783
Watch how you talk to me!

329
00:17:51.866 --> 00:17:54.828
It's a free country, Bambi.
I can smoke out here if I want to.

330
00:17:54.911 --> 00:17:56.246
Smoke my pole.

331
00:17:56.329 --> 00:17:58.582
-You are a very unkind man.
-Get inside!

332
00:17:58.665 --> 00:18:02.335
This is not professional.
Paula, this asshole over here...

333
00:18:02.502 --> 00:18:04.170
-It's okay.
-Paula!

334
00:18:04.588 --> 00:18:06.798
It's all right. Come on.
You know, it's just...

335
00:18:07.424 --> 00:18:09.259
So, how could this
not have happened?

336
00:18:09.342 --> 00:18:11.261
It just never happened.

337
00:18:11.678 --> 00:18:15.223
When I was young, I tried,
and it didn't happen.

338
00:18:15.682 --> 00:18:19.060
And then I got older
and I got more and more nervous

339
00:18:19.352 --> 00:18:22.731
because it hadn't happened yet.
And I got kind of

340
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.359
weirded out about it.
Then it really didn't happen

341
00:18:26.443 --> 00:18:29.654
and then, I don't know,
I just kind of stopped trying.

342
00:18:30.238 --> 00:18:32.449
Do you want to give it another shot?

343
00:18:32.532 --> 00:18:34.284
Maybe it's too late.

344
00:18:35.368 --> 00:18:38.204
Sometimes I feel that
it is just too late for me.

345
00:18:38.705 --> 00:18:40.540
No, that's crazy.

346
00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:43.627
You're 40 years old.
You know, 40 is the new 20.

347
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.670
You wanna spend
the next 60 years of your life

348
00:18:45.754 --> 00:18:47.255
never experiencing sex?

349
00:18:47.339 --> 00:18:49.382
And not just sex, but love

350
00:18:49.466 --> 00:18:54.387
and a relationship, and laughing
and cuddling and all that shit.

351
00:18:55.055 --> 00:18:56.389
I don't know.

352
00:18:57.599 --> 00:19:00.769
-I wouldn't know what to do.
-Look, you gotta take a risk.

353
00:19:00.852 --> 00:19:02.479
You gotta risk it. Look at me.

354
00:19:02.562 --> 00:19:04.356
I went out with this girl
for four months

355
00:19:04.439 --> 00:19:06.191
and it was the greatest,

356
00:19:06.941 --> 00:19:08.693
greatest thing in my life.

357
00:19:09.527 --> 00:19:13.406
Until she went down on this guy
in an Escalade, I think.

358
00:19:14.199 --> 00:19:15.700
And, you know, instead of saying,

359
00:19:15.784 --> 00:19:18.787
"Okay, what am I doing
that caused this behavior?"

360
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.622
I dumped her. Stupid decision.

361
00:19:20.705 --> 00:19:23.500
I spent the last two years
of my life regretting it.

362
00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:25.460
Why don't you
get her back right now?

363
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:27.754
Because she's dating
this pot dealer.

364
00:19:27.837 --> 00:19:29.464
Stupid horrible decision.

365
00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:32.676
But, hey, that's her journey,
you know. I gotta respect that.

366
00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:33.968
I gotta give her the space.

367
00:19:34.052 --> 00:19:38.014
She wants to be some immature
little bitch and blow everybody,

368
00:19:38.098 --> 00:19:40.141
-that's love, man.
-It sounds horrible.

369
00:19:40.225 --> 00:19:42.352
Of course it's horrible.
It's suffering

370
00:19:42.435 --> 00:19:44.979
and it's pain and it's...
You know, you lose weight

371
00:19:45.063 --> 00:19:46.523
and then you put back on weight

372
00:19:46.606 --> 00:19:48.692
and then you call them
a bunch of times

373
00:19:48.775 --> 00:19:52.028
and you try and email and then they
move or they change their email,

374
00:19:52.112 --> 00:19:53.613
but that's just love.

375
00:19:54.406 --> 00:19:56.074
Do you realize
that this is the first time

376
00:19:56.157 --> 00:19:58.535
we've spoken for more than,
like, 30 seconds?

377
00:19:58.618 --> 00:19:59.619
Uh-huh.

378
00:20:00.036 --> 00:20:02.539
-It's kind of nice.
-Come out with us this weekend.

379
00:20:03.623 --> 00:20:06.042
No pressure.
We'll just have a good time.

380
00:20:06.292 --> 00:20:08.878
Okay, yeah, I will.
I'll give it a shot.

381
00:20:08.962 --> 00:20:10.004
Great.

382
00:20:10.088 --> 00:20:12.173
But I'm not going to have sex
with anybody.

383
00:20:12.257 --> 00:20:14.968
Good, sex should be the last thing
on your mind.

384
00:20:27.021 --> 00:20:28.773
Logjam. Hi.

385
00:20:34.362 --> 00:20:35.363
Shit.

386
00:20:39.325 --> 00:20:40.493
Oh, God.

387
00:20:44.539 --> 00:20:45.540
Sorry.

388
00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:49.753
See you later. Thanks for the dance.

389
00:20:59.137 --> 00:21:01.181
I'm okay. It's not right.

390
00:21:07.187 --> 00:21:09.063
Oh, come on, bus!

391
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.989
Oh, come on, dogs!

392
00:21:21.117 --> 00:21:23.036
Shit! You gotta be kidding me.

393
00:21:39.344 --> 00:21:43.139
I mean, I'm kind of nervous.
I never had oral sex before.

394
00:21:43.223 --> 00:21:47.894
Jennifer told me how to do it.
It's gonna kick ass.

395
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.693
What are you doing?

396
00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:57.362
-Okay, just...
-We're almost there.

397
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:01.366
We have one. Houston, we have one.

398
00:22:01.866 --> 00:22:04.369
You'll pull my fucking hair out!

399
00:22:04.619 --> 00:22:05.995
-We did it.
-God!

400
00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:07.831
Oh, my God, you came in your pants.

401
00:22:07.914 --> 00:22:10.792
-What did you do?
- I had some Cream of Wheat.

402
00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:13.795
-You know what else is sexy?
-What?

403
00:22:14.128 --> 00:22:15.839
-Me
-Yeah?

404
00:22:15.922 --> 00:22:17.131
Sucking

405
00:22:18.466 --> 00:22:21.010
on your

406
00:22:21.594 --> 00:22:22.637
toe.

407
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.597
-That's what you want to suck on?
-Yeah.

408
00:22:24.681 --> 00:22:29.143
-It's just so big and thick.
-Okay.

409
00:22:30.687 --> 00:22:32.021
Yeah.

410
00:22:35.024 --> 00:22:36.025
That tickles.

411
00:22:37.235 --> 00:22:39.237
I'm sorry. Oh, no.

412
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.364
-Your nose is bleeding.
-You think?

413
00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:43.825
-I'm sorry.
-I'm hot!

414
00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:46.160
But, now,
you can't have any of this.

415
00:22:46.286 --> 00:22:48.872
-Mmm-hmm.
-You should just give up forever!

416
00:22:57.672 --> 00:22:59.424
Cal, what do you think?
Is this too yellow?

417
00:22:59.507 --> 00:23:00.550
No.

418
00:23:00.884 --> 00:23:02.969
What's Curious George like
in real life?

419
00:23:03.052 --> 00:23:04.262
Come on, man.

420
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.399
Wow, this is pretty crowded.

421
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:19.569
Yeah. Well, it's $9 beer night.

422
00:23:20.737 --> 00:23:22.155
Okay, look now.

423
00:23:22.238 --> 00:23:24.449
So, this is what's about to happen,
all right?

424
00:23:24.532 --> 00:23:27.243
You about to go run down
some drunk chicks, all right?

425
00:23:27.327 --> 00:23:29.746
And don't confuse that with tipsy.
We talking about drunk.

426
00:23:29.829 --> 00:23:31.831
I want vomit in the hair,
bruised-up knees.

427
00:23:31.915 --> 00:23:33.416
A broken heel is a plus.

428
00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:35.001
That's what you want to find, okay?

429
00:23:35.084 --> 00:23:37.879
No, Dave already told me
I didn't have to have sex tonight.

430
00:23:37.962 --> 00:23:38.963
And now he's gone, so...

431
00:23:39.047 --> 00:23:41.049
Dude, just stop thinking
for a minute, all right?

432
00:23:41.132 --> 00:23:42.759
You ain't got to think on this one.

433
00:23:42.842 --> 00:23:44.761
All you got to do
is use your instinct.

434
00:23:44.844 --> 00:23:46.179
Show me your instincts.

435
00:23:46.346 --> 00:23:49.098
My head, my heart.
I follow my heart.

436
00:23:49.182 --> 00:23:51.351
Now, I'm gonna show you this
one time, all right?

437
00:23:51.851 --> 00:23:54.646
Instincts. Show me your instincts.

438
00:23:54.729 --> 00:23:57.190
-Show me your instincts.
-They're right here.

439
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:59.567
Own your instincts.

440
00:23:59.651 --> 00:24:02.528
All you doing
is using your instinct. That's it.

441
00:24:02.612 --> 00:24:05.406
That's how a tiger know
he got to tackle a gazelle.

442
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.450
There's a code written in his DNA.

443
00:24:07.533 --> 00:24:09.118
-It says, "Tackle the gazelle."
-Okay.

444
00:24:09.202 --> 00:24:12.246
And believe it or not, in every man,
there's a code written that says,

445
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.332
-"Tackle drunk bitches."
-No.

446
00:24:14.457 --> 00:24:17.961
You know what,
I don't feel comfortable

447
00:24:19.253 --> 00:24:21.547
hitting on drunk "bitches,"
you know.

448
00:24:21.673 --> 00:24:22.799
I don't think that's right.

449
00:24:22.882 --> 00:24:23.883
Okay, hold up.

450
00:24:23.967 --> 00:24:26.844
First of all, you making it out
to be some kind of bad thing.

451
00:24:26.928 --> 00:24:29.305
I didn't use bitches
in a derogatory sense. You did.

452
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:30.974
It just does...
This doesn't feel right.

453
00:24:31.057 --> 00:24:33.935
Of course it don't feel right. What
has felt right for you doesn't work.

454
00:24:34.018 --> 00:24:36.604
You need to try some wrong, dawg.

455
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.359
Okay, how do I tell
which ones are drunk?

456
00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:43.152
Now you're talking.
All right, check this out.

457
00:24:43.236 --> 00:24:45.029
-You see this redhead over here?
-Where?

458
00:24:45.113 --> 00:24:48.658
-With the big old titties.
-I'm not gonna stare at a woman.

459
00:24:48.741 --> 00:24:51.369
Dawg, I'm not telling you
to stare at nobody.

460
00:24:51.494 --> 00:24:54.247
I'm telling you to use
your peripherals. Now look at me.

461
00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.790
-See. Look. See?
-Yeah.

462
00:24:56.249 --> 00:24:57.583
I'm not looking at you.

463
00:24:58.292 --> 00:25:00.878
-No. I'm looking at...
-You're looking at her?

464
00:25:02.755 --> 00:25:06.342
-What do you want me to do?
-I want you to use your peripherals.

465
00:25:06.718 --> 00:25:08.636
See? I'm not looking at you.

466
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.933
Mmm-mmm. No. See, I'm looking
at the redhead at 3:00 with the big titties.

467
00:25:14.142 --> 00:25:17.020
You see her, racked up right there,
see her?

468
00:25:17.437 --> 00:25:18.938
-Yes.
-Yeah.

469
00:25:19.188 --> 00:25:22.442
-You find one with the peripherals.
-Okay.

470
00:25:22.817 --> 00:25:25.945
You see, over by the post.

471
00:25:26.738 --> 00:25:27.947
It looks like a...

472
00:25:28.031 --> 00:25:29.741
It's either a ficus,

473
00:25:29.824 --> 00:25:31.576
it might be a rubber tree plant.

474
00:25:31.868 --> 00:25:34.704
All right, if you're making a joke,
dawg, it's not funny.

475
00:25:34.787 --> 00:25:37.373
I see a blonde
and she's very pretty.

476
00:25:37.457 --> 00:25:39.876
Better, okay. All right.

477
00:25:39.959 --> 00:25:42.003
-Now with your peripherals
-Yeah.

478
00:25:42.086 --> 00:25:44.547
You got to scope out
a hot, drunk chick.

479
00:25:44.714 --> 00:25:46.049
And then you should make your move.

480
00:25:46.132 --> 00:25:47.967
-Okay? All right.
-Yes.

481
00:25:48.134 --> 00:25:50.970
And remember, it's more important
that she's drunk than she's hot.

482
00:25:51.054 --> 00:25:54.557
For this first one. Go get her.
Peripherals, though. All the way.

483
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.143
All peripherals.

484
00:26:04.484 --> 00:26:05.777
That boy is stubborn.

485
00:26:08.654 --> 00:26:11.949
Hi, I'm Andy. You look comfortable.

486
00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.828
-Can I get you another cocktail?
-Too drunk.

487
00:26:15.912 --> 00:26:19.332
-But you got the right idea.
-But clinically alive.

488
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:22.460
-Hey!
-Yo!

489
00:26:22.543 --> 00:26:24.921
I'm having trouble
finding the drunk people.

490
00:26:25.004 --> 00:26:27.256
-You want to know where there's one?
-Yeah.

491
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.177
I. I, Captain Yellowshirts.

492
00:26:32.345 --> 00:26:34.430
Okay. Have a good one.

493
00:26:34.514 --> 00:26:35.723
-Yo!
-What?

494
00:26:35.807 --> 00:26:38.935
I met a girl and she's here
with a bachelorette party

495
00:26:39.018 --> 00:26:41.062
and they invited us
to party with them.

496
00:26:41.354 --> 00:26:44.273
-Okay, that's good.
-It's so good

497
00:26:44.357 --> 00:26:45.983
because no one is hornier
than a girl

498
00:26:46.067 --> 00:26:48.694
who's about to watch her friend
get married to a guy.

499
00:26:48.778 --> 00:26:50.196
It's so funny.

500
00:26:54.367 --> 00:26:58.162
So we just decided because this is
my last night as a free woman

501
00:26:58.246 --> 00:27:01.207
before I marry Dan,
that we would just wig out.

502
00:27:01.374 --> 00:27:03.042
We're wigging out!

503
00:27:04.252 --> 00:27:07.046
You guys are hilarious.

504
00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:09.590
Wait a minute.

505
00:27:09.674 --> 00:27:13.136
Yes, Mr. President.
Yes, the erection results are in.

506
00:27:14.428 --> 00:27:17.223
Hey, guys, look,
it's Dr. Seuss' penis.

507
00:27:17.473 --> 00:27:19.267
I really mean this.

508
00:27:20.268 --> 00:27:22.270
Hey, everybody,
who wants penis cake?

509
00:27:22.812 --> 00:27:23.896
I do.

510
00:27:24.063 --> 00:27:27.483
-She does.
-Hey, you guys, Betty Cooker.

511
00:27:29.735 --> 00:27:31.195
What a good guy. What a...

512
00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:33.197
Dan, the guy Robin's marrying,

513
00:27:33.281 --> 00:27:36.534
is such a good guy.

514
00:27:36.617 --> 00:27:38.202
He sounds like a good guy.

515
00:27:38.286 --> 00:27:41.038
I hated him for like two years
'cause he cheated on me.

516
00:27:41.122 --> 00:27:42.373
-Oh.
-But

517
00:27:45.209 --> 00:27:47.420
he's really changed now.

518
00:27:48.671 --> 00:27:51.757
-He's a really good guy now.
-Your friends seem nice.

519
00:27:51.841 --> 00:27:54.343
You have really kind eyes,
you know that?

520
00:27:54.552 --> 00:27:57.805
Thanks. Your hat has sequins.

521
00:28:12.111 --> 00:28:14.322
-You have your hands on my belt.
-What?

522
00:28:14.405 --> 00:28:16.407
-Your hands are on my belt.
-I'm sorry.

523
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.700
It's good.

524
00:28:18.284 --> 00:28:19.535
You're cute.

525
00:28:19.952 --> 00:28:22.121
This is kind of lame.
You wanna get out of here?

526
00:28:22.205 --> 00:28:24.373
Okay, yeah. So lame.

527
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.296
-Yeah.
-Fuck.

528
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.215
-Come on.
-Okay.

529
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.804
You wanna drive?

530
00:28:38.888 --> 00:28:41.432
I don't have
a car with me here, so...

531
00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:43.851
That's cool, I'll just suck it up.

532
00:28:45.436 --> 00:28:46.604
I'm driving.

533
00:28:47.688 --> 00:28:48.731
Are you drunk?

534
00:28:48.814 --> 00:28:50.399
No, I didn't have anything to drink.

535
00:28:50.483 --> 00:28:52.652
-Blow into this?
-Okay.

536
00:28:57.782 --> 00:29:01.661
-What is this?
-The judge recommended I get one.

537
00:29:08.292 --> 00:29:11.796
Whoa, okay. Wow. That's fast.

538
00:29:13.673 --> 00:29:16.217
-Okay.
-Come on, you're on a lasso.

539
00:29:19.345 --> 00:29:20.930
<i>Missy be puttin' it down</i>

540
00:29:21.013 --> 00:29:22.098
<i>I'm the hottest round</i>

541
00:29:22.181 --> 00:29:23.599
<i>I told y'all mother-uhh</i>

542
00:29:23.683 --> 00:29:24.976
<i>Y'all can't stop me now</i>

543
00:29:25.059 --> 00:29:26.102
<i>Listen to me now</i>

544
00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:27.436
<i>I'm lastin' 20 rounds</i>

545
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.021
<i>And if you want me people</i>

546
00:29:29.105 --> 00:29:30.731
<i>Then come on get me now</i>

547
00:29:31.524 --> 00:29:35.820
And Dan's like,
"You're such a B-I-T-C-H, bitch!"

548
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:39.615
And I'm like,
"You're the bitch, bitch."

549
00:29:39.699 --> 00:29:41.450
-You know?
-Uh-huh. Yeah.

550
00:29:41.534 --> 00:29:43.244
Who's your name again?

551
00:29:43.703 --> 00:29:45.037
-Andy.
-Andy.

552
00:29:45.121 --> 00:29:49.875
Let me tell you something, Andy.
Don't ever be named Dan.

553
00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:52.920
Dan rhymes with man,
and men jerk off.

554
00:29:53.004 --> 00:29:54.297
And he was a jerk-off.

555
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.091
-Do you know what I mean?
-Look out! The car!

556
00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.511
-Wow.
- I like you.

557
00:30:00.928 --> 00:30:02.430
You're not a jack

558
00:30:04.098 --> 00:30:05.099
off.

559
00:30:05.683 --> 00:30:08.352
I think I ate some
bad shellfish sandwich or something.

560
00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:12.273
-You're cute.
-No.

561
00:30:18.696 --> 00:30:21.699
-That tasted good.
-That tasted like shellfish.

562
00:30:23.075 --> 00:30:25.828
Look out! Sorry.

563
00:30:26.871 --> 00:30:28.039
Watch it!

564
00:30:30.374 --> 00:30:32.877
-Do you think I'm pretty?
-Oh, yes.

565
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:34.628
Oh, God, yes!

566
00:30:36.088 --> 00:30:38.507
-You're not looking at me.
-Yes, you're pretty.

567
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:40.426
-You're not looking at me.
-Yes, you're pretty.

568
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:43.179
Do you think I'm pretty? Look at me.

569
00:30:43.262 --> 00:30:46.307
-Look at me!
-I'm looking! You're pretty!

570
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:48.768
God, I just wanna live!

571
00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:52.980
God, I hope I get my period soon.

572
00:30:53.105 --> 00:30:56.609
-I am in a bad mood.
-Okay.

573
00:30:56.692 --> 00:30:59.612
I'm so tired.

574
00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:01.864
Hey, whoa!

575
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.451
Oh, God! Turn away!

576
00:31:05.576 --> 00:31:07.745
Hey, hands off the wheel.

577
00:31:09.455 --> 00:31:12.041
You're not gonna get in my pants
acting like that.

578
00:31:12.124 --> 00:31:13.667
I'm starving.

579
00:31:13.918 --> 00:31:16.462
Let's get some fucking French toast.

580
00:31:18.506 --> 00:31:22.134
-Okay, here we are.
-Oh, God, we made it.

581
00:31:22.218 --> 00:31:23.594
Home sweet home.

582
00:31:24.887 --> 00:31:26.764
Oh, mommy!

583
00:31:30.434 --> 00:31:34.230
-Are you okay?
-The fucker came out of nowhere.

584
00:31:35.648 --> 00:31:38.234
Okay. We're okay.

585
00:31:41.028 --> 00:31:42.363
Are you okay?

586
00:31:43.197 --> 00:31:45.366
Well, are you... What's the matter?

587
00:31:51.038 --> 00:31:52.331
I'm sorry.

588
00:31:52.873 --> 00:31:56.335
That's okay.
I think I kind of had that coming.

589
00:31:57.128 --> 00:31:59.255
I'll still have sex with you
if you want.

590
00:31:59.338 --> 00:32:02.383
You know what, I think I'm gonna
pass on the sex, if you don't mind.

591
00:32:02.466 --> 00:32:04.969
At least I don't have
to work out tomorrow.

592
00:32:05.678 --> 00:32:07.596
-Did you have a daiquiri tonight?
-Yeah.

593
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.681
I thought you might.

594
00:32:09.014 --> 00:32:10.641
It was a very bad night.

595
00:32:12.685 --> 00:32:13.727
Yeah, laugh.

596
00:32:13.811 --> 00:32:16.063
You know what, you guys
wouldn't be laughing right now

597
00:32:16.147 --> 00:32:19.900
if some girl had just vomited
shellfish sandwich into your mouth.

598
00:32:21.026 --> 00:32:22.695
You know what, you're right,
it's my bad.

599
00:32:22.778 --> 00:32:24.738
Let me apologize to you
first of all

600
00:32:24.822 --> 00:32:28.659
for not mentioning in detail that
when you pick up a drunk woman

601
00:32:28.742 --> 00:32:31.412
who's falling down on her way
out of the bar

602
00:32:31.495 --> 00:32:34.290
-that you should probably drive.
-I drive a bike.

603
00:32:34.373 --> 00:32:37.960
Okay, Mr. Schwinn-fucking-Armstrong,
who asked you to drive a bike?

604
00:32:38.043 --> 00:32:40.171
You know what, I'm not
the only person in the world

605
00:32:40.254 --> 00:32:41.422
who rides a bike.

606
00:32:41.505 --> 00:32:44.175
Yeah, everyone rides a bike,
when they're fucking six.

607
00:32:44.258 --> 00:32:46.385
Why don't you kiss something?

608
00:32:46.469 --> 00:32:49.597
Because this is over,
you guys, okay?

609
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.307
Can I just interject for a second?

610
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.808
Let me just say

611
00:32:52.892 --> 00:32:55.269
you're putting the pussy up
on this pedestal.

612
00:32:55.352 --> 00:32:56.854
You're just building
the pussy up, man.

613
00:32:56.937 --> 00:32:58.314
What are you even talking about?

614
00:32:58.397 --> 00:33:00.357
"Building the pussy up,"
what does that mean?

615
00:33:00.441 --> 00:33:05.154
You making the pussy into this great
big Greek goddess named Pussalia

616
00:33:05.237 --> 00:33:06.447
and what you're doing is

617
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:10.034
you're psyching yourself into
thinking it's some impossible feat.

618
00:33:10.117 --> 00:33:11.243
Yeah, I think you're right.

619
00:33:11.327 --> 00:33:13.287
I'm putting the pussy up
on a pedestal.

620
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.747
-Right.
-That's it.

621
00:33:14.955 --> 00:33:16.749
It's "Pussalia," right?

622
00:33:16.832 --> 00:33:19.293
-Look where you going.
-I don't wanna say the word anymore.

623
00:33:19.376 --> 00:33:21.629
-Say what word?
-"Pussy." I don't wanna say it.

624
00:33:21.712 --> 00:33:23.964
Fuck it.
"Pussy" is a scientific word.

625
00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:26.175
Dude! New pants, man.

626
00:33:26.717 --> 00:33:27.801
You know what, Dave?

627
00:33:27.885 --> 00:33:30.346
You know, you said there wasn't
gonna be any pressure at all.

628
00:33:30.429 --> 00:33:31.847
-I'm not pressuring you.
-Excuse me.

629
00:33:31.931 --> 00:33:33.641
Can one of you guys help me, please?

630
00:33:33.766 --> 00:33:35.392
<i>No hablo</i> English, lady.

631
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:39.063
I actually am helping
a customer right now.

632
00:33:39.146 --> 00:33:41.524
-Okay, well...
-I'm on break.

633
00:33:41.607 --> 00:33:44.151
But our stock supervisor
is very knowledgeable.

634
00:33:44.235 --> 00:33:46.695
He can answer all of your questions
and he'd love to help you.

635
00:33:46.779 --> 00:33:47.863
Thank you.

636
00:33:47.947 --> 00:33:49.740
-Have a nice day.
-You, too.

637
00:33:50.491 --> 00:33:54.787
-Great, okay. Hi, I'm Trish.
-Hi, Andy is my name.

638
00:33:55.287 --> 00:33:58.374
-This one looks pretty good.
-You don't wanna buy that VCR.

639
00:33:58.457 --> 00:33:59.416
I don't?

640
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.293
No, actually to be
totally honest with you

641
00:34:01.377 --> 00:34:02.711
you don't wanna buy any VCR.

642
00:34:02.795 --> 00:34:04.463
It's a dead technology.

643
00:34:04.547 --> 00:34:08.676
It's like getting
an eight-track player.

644
00:34:08.759 --> 00:34:11.178
-Yeah.
-Or a Betamax.

645
00:34:11.387 --> 00:34:13.264
You know what,
actually I'd recommend this one.

646
00:34:13.347 --> 00:34:17.476
This is a dual.
You've got the VCR and DVD combo.

647
00:34:17.685 --> 00:34:21.230
So, you know, that technology
would be probably pretty good for...

648
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.606
-Six months or so?
-Yeah.

649
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:23.983
That's good.

650
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:26.068
At best. Sorry.

651
00:34:26.193 --> 00:34:28.571
-No.
-As good as it gets.

652
00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:29.905
Okay, that sounds good, then.

653
00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:30.990
Okay, all right.

654
00:34:32.157 --> 00:34:33.242
-It's perfect.
-Sorry.

655
00:34:33.325 --> 00:34:34.618
Coming through.

656
00:34:34.994 --> 00:34:36.078
Okay.

657
00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:38.872
God, you know, it's so funny,
I work right across the street

658
00:34:38.956 --> 00:34:40.374
and I've never been in this place.

659
00:34:40.457 --> 00:34:41.750
-Really? Where at?
-Yeah.

660
00:34:41.834 --> 00:34:44.503
The "We Sell Your Stuff On eBay"
store.

661
00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:47.089
-Yes.
-And that's the name?

662
00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:49.675
Yeah, I was looking for something,

663
00:34:49.925 --> 00:34:52.678
you know, obvious. So I chose that.

664
00:34:52.886 --> 00:34:55.264
I don't understand.
So, what, you do what?

665
00:34:55.347 --> 00:34:57.308
Well, I take the stuff
that you don't want

666
00:34:57.391 --> 00:34:59.476
and then I "sell" it on eBay.

667
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.396
But you don't actually sell anything
in the store?

668
00:35:03.188 --> 00:35:04.732
No. I don't.

669
00:35:05.316 --> 00:35:07.401
So why do you have a store?

670
00:35:07.484 --> 00:35:08.777
I don't know.

671
00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:12.114
No, I think it's because, you know,
I wanna maybe look professional

672
00:35:12.197 --> 00:35:15.117
and not like a crazy person who's
just gonna steal all your shit.

673
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.578
Sure. I didn't
mean anything by that.

674
00:35:17.661 --> 00:35:19.121
No, it's okay.

675
00:35:19.413 --> 00:35:22.958
You know what, you should come by
sometime if you want, you know,

676
00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:24.752
see it for yourself, check it out.

677
00:35:24.835 --> 00:35:26.378
I'll check out your empty store.

678
00:35:26.462 --> 00:35:28.797
Yeah, it's the one across the street
that's not empty.

679
00:35:31.133 --> 00:35:32.843
Here's my number. So...

680
00:35:33.177 --> 00:35:35.638
-All right.
-So, just anytime.

681
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:40.351
Why do I need your number
if you're across the street, though?

682
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:43.354
I don't really have a good answer
for that, Andy. I just...

683
00:35:43.437 --> 00:35:45.397
-Sorry.
-Just giving it to you.

684
00:35:45.731 --> 00:35:48.817
So I'll write you up, and I'll
meet you over at the register.

685
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:50.527
-Okay.
-And check you out... Check out.

686
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:51.945
-Okay, see you over there.
-Okay.

687
00:35:52.029 --> 00:35:53.030
Okay.

688
00:35:53.489 --> 00:35:55.574
-Awful chatty.
-Hey,

689
00:35:55.949 --> 00:35:58.035
look, I think she gave me
her number.

690
00:35:58.118 --> 00:36:00.663
She wrote down her number,
but I think she gave me her number.

691
00:36:00.746 --> 00:36:02.081
No, she gave you. Dude, man.

692
00:36:02.164 --> 00:36:03.749
See, you still mad at me?

693
00:36:03.832 --> 00:36:05.668
-No, I was never.
-Right, you see what I mean?

694
00:36:05.751 --> 00:36:07.670
Yeah, we gonna celebrate it, man.
Yeah.

695
00:36:07.753 --> 00:36:09.171
-This is pretty cool.
-Yeah.

696
00:36:09.254 --> 00:36:11.173
-Unbelievable.
-Come on, give him some credit, man.

697
00:36:11.256 --> 00:36:12.424
The man pulled a number.

698
00:36:12.508 --> 00:36:15.052
It's just... I was in...
I can't believe that happened.

699
00:36:15.135 --> 00:36:16.595
What you did with you's own hand.

700
00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:18.847
Man, she just gave me her number.

701
00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:23.644
That's great, man. I'm telling you,
love is a mysterious fig.

702
00:36:23.727 --> 00:36:24.728
It is.

703
00:36:24.812 --> 00:36:27.606
Okay, here's a question.
When should I call her?

704
00:36:28.315 --> 00:36:29.483
-You like her?
-Yeah.

705
00:36:29.566 --> 00:36:30.984
You definitely
don't want to call her.

706
00:36:31.068 --> 00:36:32.695
When is the next Olympics?

707
00:36:32.778 --> 00:36:34.113
So what you just got to do is

708
00:36:34.196 --> 00:36:36.031
just get you a bunch
of these hood rats,

709
00:36:36.115 --> 00:36:37.533
run through them,
just knock them out.

710
00:36:37.616 --> 00:36:38.701
Boom, boom, boom.

711
00:36:38.784 --> 00:36:41.286
And once you've done slayed
like 20, 30 of them hood rats,

712
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.081
now you ready to go up
to the upper echelon type ho.

713
00:36:44.164 --> 00:36:46.208
-You know what I mean?
-I'm not a big ho runner.

714
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:48.043
My uncle used to drive a ho runner.

715
00:36:48.127 --> 00:36:50.003
Screw these analogies.
What he's saying is

716
00:36:50.087 --> 00:36:52.089
you are going to be so bad
at sex the first time,

717
00:36:52.172 --> 00:36:54.216
you don't want to have sex
with someone you like

718
00:36:54.299 --> 00:36:56.593
'cause they'll think you're a weirdo
for being so lame at it.

719
00:36:56.677 --> 00:36:58.721
You want to have sex
with hood rats first

720
00:36:58.804 --> 00:37:00.889
so that by the time
you get to the girl you do like

721
00:37:00.973 --> 00:37:04.435
you're not terrible at sex,
you'll be mediocre at it.

722
00:37:04.977 --> 00:37:06.437
Probably still pretty bad, though.

723
00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.522
Let's put it up for my man
for pulling that number.

724
00:37:08.605 --> 00:37:10.941
-Way to go, man.
-Politicked his ass off.

725
00:37:11.024 --> 00:37:13.318
-You did politic.
-Thanks a lot.

726
00:37:13.444 --> 00:37:15.821
Like a train, round the bend.
You ready?

727
00:37:49.688 --> 00:37:50.689
Yeah.

728
00:37:51.815 --> 00:37:52.983
-I can't.
-Do it.

729
00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:54.693
-I can't pee in public.
-Gotta do it.

730
00:37:54.777 --> 00:37:56.361
I've got a mental block about it.

731
00:37:56.445 --> 00:37:59.656
-Come on, do it.
-I'm shy!

732
00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:06.538
I'm peeing in public!

733
00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.124
-Let me out.
-I can't hear what you're saying.

734
00:38:09.208 --> 00:38:12.211
-I don't want to be in here.
-It's a soundproof room.

735
00:38:12.503 --> 00:38:14.963
-Just learn the techniques.
-Right on, man.

736
00:38:16.173 --> 00:38:17.966
You guys, this is not funny!

737
00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:50.374
Hello.

738
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.215
Hey, what you watching?

739
00:38:58.298 --> 00:39:00.425
-<i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, man.
-Great.

740
00:39:00.592 --> 00:39:02.761
The store is slow. Paula's gone.

741
00:39:02.928 --> 00:39:05.305
-Yo, is Paula back?
-No. She's not here.

742
00:39:05.597 --> 00:39:07.558
She said we can't watch this
in here. You sure?

743
00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:10.018
I know. Can I ask you something
in confidence?

744
00:39:10.102 --> 00:39:12.145
I know this is gonna sound weird.

745
00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:14.356
Am I good-looking?

746
00:39:14.439 --> 00:39:16.608
Do you think a woman
would find me attractive?

747
00:39:16.692 --> 00:39:18.235
Oh, my God!

748
00:39:18.694 --> 00:39:21.280
-Oh, my God, the blood just...
-Okay, never mind.

749
00:39:21.363 --> 00:39:23.198
Wait, Andy. Hold up.

750
00:39:23.282 --> 00:39:26.243
Listen, this is embarrassing for me.
This is hard to talk about.

751
00:39:26.326 --> 00:39:28.787
-Are you ready for my honest answer?
-Yes.

752
00:39:29.288 --> 00:39:31.623
Yeah. I think
you're a good-looking cat.

753
00:39:32.332 --> 00:39:33.876
I don't think
that anybody knows it

754
00:39:33.959 --> 00:39:35.544
and I don't think
anybody can see it.

755
00:39:35.627 --> 00:39:36.795
Well, that's why I'm asking you.

756
00:39:36.879 --> 00:39:39.381
You seem really well-groomed
and really put together.

757
00:39:39.464 --> 00:39:42.342
I mean, look, dude.
You think this was an accident?

758
00:39:42.676 --> 00:39:45.053
All of this right here?
Premeditated, partner.

759
00:39:45.137 --> 00:39:48.515
You gotta highlight your attributes,
like a diamond in the rough.

760
00:39:48.599 --> 00:39:50.309
You willing to make some sacrifices?

761
00:39:50.392 --> 00:39:51.435
Absolutely.

762
00:39:51.518 --> 00:39:54.313
You see that whole <i>Teen Wolf</i> thing
you got going right there?

763
00:39:54.396 --> 00:39:56.231
You need to wax that right out.

764
00:39:56.315 --> 00:39:58.191
-Does it hurt?
-No. Waxing don't hurt.

765
00:39:58.275 --> 00:40:00.402
I mean, not unless you're a bitch.
You know what I mean?

766
00:40:00.485 --> 00:40:01.820
It didn't hurt me.
I get it done all the time.

767
00:40:02.988 --> 00:40:04.281
What the fuck!

768
00:40:07.284 --> 00:40:09.161
Fuck that nigger up!

769
00:40:09.995 --> 00:40:12.456
Bitch, get out of the room!

770
00:40:15.375 --> 00:40:17.419
This is gonna be good.

771
00:40:17.502 --> 00:40:19.713
-This the one right here, right?
-Hi, how are you?

772
00:40:19.796 --> 00:40:21.924
So this is your first time
getting body waxed?

773
00:40:22.007 --> 00:40:23.091
Yes, it is.

774
00:40:23.175 --> 00:40:25.260
-Take off your shirt.
-Okay.

775
00:40:28.513 --> 00:40:30.599
We're gonna need more wax.

776
00:40:30.682 --> 00:40:33.018
I'm staying. This is gonna be good.

777
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.355
And clear all my appointments
in the afternoon.

778
00:40:36.605 --> 00:40:37.940
Here we go.

779
00:40:38.273 --> 00:40:39.608
That feels warm.

780
00:40:42.736 --> 00:40:45.864
I like your sweater.
Does that come in a V-neck?

781
00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:49.701
If she starts doing his pubes,
I'm out of here.

782
00:40:51.954 --> 00:40:53.288
You gonna look good after this, man.

783
00:40:53.372 --> 00:40:54.581
Thanks, man.

784
00:40:54.957 --> 00:40:56.333
-So, ready?
-Yeah.

785
00:41:02.422 --> 00:41:04.299
You fucker!

786
00:41:05.425 --> 00:41:08.011
I'm sorry. That's just your job.

787
00:41:08.095 --> 00:41:11.556
-You want me to stop now?
-No. It's okay.

788
00:41:13.058 --> 00:41:14.309
Let's do another one.

789
00:41:14.393 --> 00:41:15.978
That one little patch
looks sexy though.

790
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:18.146
-Does it look good?
-Yeah, it looks really good.

791
00:41:19.314 --> 00:41:21.692
It looks man-tastic.

792
00:41:22.901 --> 00:41:24.069
Okay.

793
00:41:25.696 --> 00:41:29.324
Wow! I didn't expect that at all.
I really didn't expect that.

794
00:41:30.075 --> 00:41:32.285
You got it. The first one
is the only one that hurts.

795
00:41:32.369 --> 00:41:34.830
Yeah. Those hairs are pretty deep.

796
00:41:34.913 --> 00:41:35.998
Okay.

797
00:41:36.289 --> 00:41:37.916
-You ready?
-Yup.

798
00:41:41.753 --> 00:41:43.505
Sucker motherfucker!

799
00:41:43.922 --> 00:41:46.216
You shithead! I hate you!

800
00:41:46.299 --> 00:41:48.093
I hate you so much!

801
00:41:49.261 --> 00:41:50.470
That one hurt.

802
00:41:50.554 --> 00:41:52.889
That one hurt
just as much as the first one.

803
00:41:52.973 --> 00:41:54.975
-That's great, man.
-Man!

804
00:41:56.893 --> 00:41:59.146
One, two, three.

805
00:42:00.313 --> 00:42:04.317
Fuck me!

806
00:42:04.776 --> 00:42:08.280
In the asshole!

807
00:42:10.449 --> 00:42:11.575
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

808
00:42:11.658 --> 00:42:13.243
I really don't swear this much.

809
00:42:13.326 --> 00:42:14.703
You know what, I got a weak stomach.

810
00:42:14.786 --> 00:42:16.496
That's all I can really take.
I'll see y'all.

811
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.041
-Jay.
-Be tough, Andy, you got it.

812
00:42:19.124 --> 00:42:21.209
-Where did Jay go?
-He went to throw up.

813
00:42:21.293 --> 00:42:22.586
-Ready?
-Yup.

814
00:42:23.295 --> 00:42:24.379
One, two.

815
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:27.841
Cocksucker motherfucker!

816
00:42:27.966 --> 00:42:29.634
You pulled on two.

817
00:42:30.886 --> 00:42:32.554
Why didn't you pull on three?

818
00:42:32.637 --> 00:42:33.972
Freddy pie hole!

819
00:42:35.682 --> 00:42:37.601
No! Kelly Clarkson!

820
00:42:42.606 --> 00:42:43.607
Y'all done or y'all...

821
00:42:44.775 --> 00:42:46.151
-That's fucked up.
-Oh, shit balls!

822
00:42:46.234 --> 00:42:47.611
That's fucked up.

823
00:42:50.363 --> 00:42:52.282
I hate you.

824
00:42:52.365 --> 00:42:54.743
Stop smiling, you jerk!

825
00:42:54.826 --> 00:42:55.994
You pussy.

826
00:42:56.078 --> 00:42:58.163
Oh, God. What's next?

827
00:42:58.538 --> 00:43:00.749
-You're doing the nipple.
-Not the nipple.

828
00:43:00.832 --> 00:43:02.584
-Come on.
-Not the nipple.

829
00:43:02.667 --> 00:43:04.336
Please, Cal, hold my hand.

830
00:43:04.753 --> 00:43:07.547
-You kidding me, man?
-Hold my goddamn hand, man.

831
00:43:08.131 --> 00:43:10.383
Do it! Just hold. Okay, here we go.

832
00:43:11.635 --> 00:43:12.677
Ready?

833
00:43:13.345 --> 00:43:14.638
No. Yup.

834
00:43:14.721 --> 00:43:16.681
One, two, three.

835
00:43:17.224 --> 00:43:19.643
Nipple fuck!

836
00:43:21.019 --> 00:43:23.480
Mika, you should burn in hell!

837
00:43:23.939 --> 00:43:26.608
Okay, all right.
No, seriously, I think I'm done.

838
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:29.027
I think we're done.
I think that's good.

839
00:43:31.196 --> 00:43:32.489
You know what, guys,

840
00:43:32.572 --> 00:43:35.117
this is not a good look for me!

841
00:43:35.534 --> 00:43:37.327
You look like a man-o'-lantern.

842
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.371
-Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
-Thank you.

843
00:43:58.932 --> 00:44:00.642
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

844
00:44:00.725 --> 00:44:02.394
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

845
00:44:02.853 --> 00:44:04.896
Andy, I owe you an apology, man.

846
00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.400
I wasn't very nice to you
for the past two-and-a-half years.

847
00:44:08.483 --> 00:44:09.609
You were nice to me.

848
00:44:09.693 --> 00:44:12.320
No, I was... I thought
you were really boring and

849
00:44:12.404 --> 00:44:14.781
I kind of thought
you were a serial Killer.

850
00:44:16.032 --> 00:44:17.409
I'm not joking.

851
00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:20.829
-Hey!
-Sorry. Shoot. Sorry, sorry.

852
00:44:20.912 --> 00:44:23.206
Don't worry.
There's a lot of padding in these.

853
00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.292
I could hurl it off the balcony,
it would be fine.

854
00:44:25.375 --> 00:44:27.252
-Yeah. It will be fine.
-We couldn't break this

855
00:44:27.335 --> 00:44:28.503
-if we tried.
-No problem.

856
00:44:28.587 --> 00:44:30.672
Look, you shouldn't listen
to Dave and Jay, okay?

857
00:44:30.755 --> 00:44:33.717
Those guys are crazy.
You should listen to me, okay?

858
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.720
Look, there is a hot-ass girl
who works right there.

859
00:44:36.803 --> 00:44:39.681
There she is, in the bookstore.
You should ask her out, man.

860
00:44:42.392 --> 00:44:44.060
Something wrong with her underpants.

861
00:44:44.144 --> 00:44:45.604
Yeah, they're not in my mouth.

862
00:44:45.687 --> 00:44:47.647
You know, I kind of

863
00:44:49.065 --> 00:44:51.234
like the woman from the eBay store.

864
00:44:51.318 --> 00:44:52.360
That's great, but

865
00:44:52.444 --> 00:44:53.695
you're not gonna get with anyone

866
00:44:53.778 --> 00:44:55.405
unless you play
the odds on this, man.

867
00:44:55.488 --> 00:44:57.324
You need to plant a lot of seeds.

868
00:44:57.449 --> 00:45:00.076
It's like this. When I was
growing pot, I realized

869
00:45:01.453 --> 00:45:04.581
-That the more seeds I planted
-Thank you.

870
00:45:04.789 --> 00:45:06.875
The more pot
I could ultimately smoke.

871
00:45:06.958 --> 00:45:10.170
I think I have all the advice
that I can handle right now.

872
00:45:10.295 --> 00:45:11.338
Don't get bitter.

873
00:45:11.421 --> 00:45:14.466
I'm not bitter.
I almost lost a nipple, okay?

874
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:16.343
That was Jay's idea, okay?

875
00:45:16.426 --> 00:45:18.929
And I wasn't going to say anything,
but waxing your chest is

876
00:45:19.012 --> 00:45:21.514
like the gayest thing
you could possibly do, okay?

877
00:45:21.598 --> 00:45:25.227
Look at me. Looks are not important.
Really look at me.

878
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.313
I am ugly as fuck
by traditional standards

879
00:45:28.396 --> 00:45:30.857
but I get with women.

880
00:45:30.941 --> 00:45:33.068
Aren't you curious
as to how that's possible?

881
00:45:33.151 --> 00:45:35.528
I am not ugly as fuck.

882
00:45:35.612 --> 00:45:37.113
I didn't say you were ugly as...

883
00:45:37.197 --> 00:45:38.907
-Well, you implied it.
-Okay.

884
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:41.576
It doesn't matter if you're ugly
as fuck or you're ugly as shit.

885
00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.704
It's about talking to women,
and I know how to do that

886
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:48.250
because I observe,
because I am a novelist.

887
00:45:48.917 --> 00:45:50.710
What? You never told me that before.

888
00:45:50.794 --> 00:45:53.505
That's because
I am not an arrogant prick, Andy.

889
00:45:53.713 --> 00:45:56.299
Okay? The problem
most men have is

890
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:57.926
they don't know
how to talk to women.

891
00:45:58.009 --> 00:46:01.721
You know what my problem is?
I am not interesting.

892
00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.516
What am I supposed to say?
"I went to magic camp?"

893
00:46:04.975 --> 00:46:06.518
"I'm an accomplished ventriloquist?"

894
00:46:06.685 --> 00:46:10.105
"I am a seventh-degree
imperial yo-yo master."

895
00:46:11.439 --> 00:46:13.275
Do me, yo-yo master.

896
00:46:13.358 --> 00:46:17.028
I want you to do me,
'cause you're the yo-yo guy.

897
00:46:17.237 --> 00:46:18.530
Are you done? Listen.

898
00:46:18.613 --> 00:46:20.365
The problem most men have is

899
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:23.868
they just plain straight up
have no clue how to talk to women.

900
00:46:24.369 --> 00:46:27.330
Just ask a question, okay?
That's it.

901
00:46:27.455 --> 00:46:30.542
Because women do not care
about what you have to say

902
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:32.168
at all anyway, you know.

903
00:46:32.252 --> 00:46:34.212
And all they want to do
is talk about themselves.

904
00:46:34.296 --> 00:46:35.922
So you're just gonna
let them do that.

905
00:46:36.006 --> 00:46:37.632
Okay? So remember.

906
00:46:37.716 --> 00:46:40.969
Questions, be cool,
and be kind of a dick.

907
00:46:41.052 --> 00:46:44.222
Here, be David Caruso in <i>Jade</i>.

908
00:46:44.806 --> 00:46:46.975
Okay. I know exactly
what you're talking about.

909
00:46:47.058 --> 00:46:48.560
You do. That's good.

910
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.688
There she is.

911
00:46:54.524 --> 00:46:56.234
Go plant that seed, man.

912
00:46:56.693 --> 00:46:58.445
Plant it with your finger.

913
00:47:10.832 --> 00:47:12.250
Can I help you?

914
00:47:14.169 --> 00:47:15.795
I don't know. Can you?

915
00:47:17.505 --> 00:47:19.466
Are you looking for something?

916
00:47:20.884 --> 00:47:23.511
Is there something
I should be looking for?

917
00:47:28.099 --> 00:47:29.642
We have a lot of books.

918
00:47:29.726 --> 00:47:32.812
So, maybe it depends
on what you like.

919
00:47:37.942 --> 00:47:39.444
What do you like?

920
00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:43.114
We have a great section of

921
00:47:43.573 --> 00:47:45.033
do-it-yourself.

922
00:47:45.116 --> 00:47:47.494
Do you like to "do it yourself'?

923
00:47:48.536 --> 00:47:50.705
Sometimes. I mean,

924
00:47:51.289 --> 00:47:54.834
if the mood strikes.

925
00:47:56.086 --> 00:47:58.129
How is the mood striking you now?

926
00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.679
What's your name?

927
00:48:07.305 --> 00:48:08.473
What's your name?

928
00:48:08.598 --> 00:48:10.642
I'm Beth.

929
00:48:13.478 --> 00:48:14.604
Andy.

930
00:48:15.855 --> 00:48:16.981
Andy.

931
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:22.195
-Don't tell on me, okay, Andy?
-I won't.

932
00:48:23.947 --> 00:48:26.282
Unless you want to be told on,

933
00:48:27.033 --> 00:48:28.034
Beth.

934
00:48:30.954 --> 00:48:32.580
Wow. That totally worked!

935
00:48:32.664 --> 00:48:34.666
I literally said nothing.
And she found me fascinating.

936
00:48:34.749 --> 00:48:36.584
I would've thought
you were doing that for years.

937
00:48:36.668 --> 00:48:38.461
-Should I have asked her out?
-No. That's the key.

938
00:48:38.545 --> 00:48:39.963
You wait for it
to grow into a plant

939
00:48:40.046 --> 00:48:41.464
and then you fuck the plant.

940
00:48:45.635 --> 00:48:46.678
Okay.

941
00:48:47.554 --> 00:48:48.805
This is easy.

942
00:48:49.556 --> 00:48:50.890
All right.

943
00:48:51.391 --> 00:48:54.018
Hello, Trish. How you doing?
What's going on?

944
00:48:55.603 --> 00:48:56.771
Good joke.

945
00:48:56.896 --> 00:48:58.648
This is a fun conversation.

946
00:48:58.731 --> 00:49:01.109
Just grow a backbone and call her.

947
00:49:01.234 --> 00:49:04.195
She asked you to call her.
She wants you to call her.

948
00:49:10.994 --> 00:49:13.621
-Hello.
-Hey, how you doing?

949
00:49:15.832 --> 00:49:17.625
-How you doing?
<i>-I'm well.</i>

950
00:49:18.042 --> 00:49:19.502
<i>Who is this?</i>

951
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:23.298
-This is James.
<i>-James. Do I know you, James?</i>

952
00:49:24.757 --> 00:49:26.801
I was wondering whether
you had a few minutes

953
00:49:26.885 --> 00:49:28.761
to talk about
a little laundry detergent.

954
00:49:28.845 --> 00:49:31.139
Are you a telemarketer, James?

955
00:49:31.222 --> 00:49:32.223
Yep.

956
00:49:32.307 --> 00:49:33.725
<i>Are you at the top
of a tall building?</i>

957
00:49:33.808 --> 00:49:36.144
<i>Can you get to a roof quickly?
Jump off!</i>

958
00:49:36.227 --> 00:49:37.353
I mean, you people are sick.

959
00:49:37.437 --> 00:49:39.230
Get a real fucking job,
why don't you?

960
00:49:39.314 --> 00:49:40.857
<i>Go shoot yourself
in the fucking head.</i>

961
00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:43.776
Hey, why don't you just, you know,
get a knife and run into it?

962
00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.236
<i>Why don't you do that, huh?</i>

963
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.613
-Okay.
<i>-I'll see you later, James.</i>

964
00:49:46.696 --> 00:49:50.033
-Nice to talk to you.
<i>-Fuck your mother, okay? Bye-bye.</i>

965
00:49:56.039 --> 00:49:58.416
Hey, man.
Got a big box of porn for you.

966
00:50:00.126 --> 00:50:02.462
-Can I come in?
-Yeah.

967
00:50:04.422 --> 00:50:06.341
Sweet video game chair.

968
00:50:10.178 --> 00:50:11.471
So what's in the box?

969
00:50:11.554 --> 00:50:13.932
It's my personal collection
of erotica.

970
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:15.517
I want to give it to you.

971
00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.520
I think there might be a few tapes
in there that just might open up

972
00:50:18.603 --> 00:50:20.104
Pandora's box of love.

973
00:50:20.188 --> 00:50:21.189
Okay.

974
00:50:21.272 --> 00:50:24.108
Amy and I,
we used to watch <i>Harry Twatter</i>

975
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.693
and we'd put it on the television

976
00:50:25.777 --> 00:50:27.695
and then act it out
as it was going on

977
00:50:27.779 --> 00:50:29.405
and it was...

978
00:50:31.366 --> 00:50:32.909
She's adorable.

979
00:50:33.743 --> 00:50:35.161
Fucking bitch.

980
00:50:35.286 --> 00:50:37.413
Well, you know,
this is really gracious and kind

981
00:50:37.497 --> 00:50:38.623
and generous and everything.

982
00:50:38.706 --> 00:50:41.334
But I just don't want a big box
of porn in my apartment.

983
00:50:41.417 --> 00:50:43.836
I have some really
great stuff in here.

984
00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:46.297
Really great movies in here, man.

985
00:50:46.673 --> 00:50:48.216
Hey, did you ever see
<i>School of Rock</i>?

986
00:50:48.299 --> 00:50:49.717
-Yeah.
-Well, this is...

987
00:50:49.801 --> 00:50:51.553
It's called <i>School of...</i>

988
00:50:51.803 --> 00:50:52.929
You know...

989
00:50:53.137 --> 00:50:56.516
-That's nice.
-But it stars Jack Black Cock.

990
00:50:56.808 --> 00:50:58.643
That makes sense.

991
00:50:58.726 --> 00:51:00.562
Dude, here it is.

992
00:51:00.645 --> 00:51:03.189
<i>Boner Jams '03</i>.
It's a mixed tape I made.

993
00:51:03.273 --> 00:51:07.360
All these great scenes that I was
really into in the summer of 2003.

994
00:51:07.652 --> 00:51:10.405
- I think you'd really dig it.
-Yeah. Now I can see that.

995
00:51:10.488 --> 00:51:12.031
This is

996
00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:13.992
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

997
00:51:14.075 --> 00:51:15.368
That's probably
not supposed to be...

998
00:51:15.451 --> 00:51:17.078
This is a good show.
I just tape it sometimes.

999
00:51:17.161 --> 00:51:19.122
Well, I don't think
you understand something, Dave.

1000
00:51:19.205 --> 00:51:23.668
I don't want this stuff, okay?
Because I don't do that, that much.

1001
00:51:23.793 --> 00:51:25.753
-What, masturbate?
-Yeah.

1002
00:51:26.921 --> 00:51:29.257
Dude, I've jacked it twice
since I've been here.

1003
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.427
-Are you kidding me? Why not?
-It's not a hobby of mine.

1004
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:34.846
Well, then, that's the only hobby
you don't have.

1005
00:51:34.929 --> 00:51:37.307
No, seriously, I just don't feel
comfortable talking about...

1006
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:38.474
You need to. You're wound up.

1007
00:51:38.558 --> 00:51:40.143
You're like one of these
action figures,

1008
00:51:40.226 --> 00:51:41.936
all hermetically sealed in your box.

1009
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.397
-You gotta play with...
-Don't!

1010
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.565
Don't take it out!

1011
00:51:45.648 --> 00:51:48.276
I'm sorry.
You know what, it's just...

1012
00:51:48.401 --> 00:51:50.987
It loses its value if you
take it out of its packaging.

1013
00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:54.198
I'm just saying, let it out.
Give it some air, man. Play with it.

1014
00:51:54.365 --> 00:51:57.035
-Take your porn with you.
-I'm not taking it.

1015
00:51:57.118 --> 00:51:58.786
Take your box-o-porn.

1016
00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:01.664
-It's my gift to you.
-No. I don't want it.

1017
00:52:01.914 --> 00:52:03.082
David, it's not...

1018
00:52:03.166 --> 00:52:04.208
Andy, for the last time,

1019
00:52:04.292 --> 00:52:06.127
I don't want your giant box
of pornography.

1020
00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:08.546
No, no, no! Come on, man.

1021
00:52:08.796 --> 00:52:10.089
So uncool.

1022
00:52:10.715 --> 00:52:11.883
Uncool?

1023
00:52:12.925 --> 00:52:16.721
Uncool is trying to give an
honest man a big box of porn, Andy.

1024
00:52:17.722 --> 00:52:21.684
For the last time, I don't want
to watch <i>School of Cock</i> with you.

1025
00:53:31.754 --> 00:53:33.631
<i>It's nothing official.</i>

1026
00:53:34.757 --> 00:53:37.760
<i>Just a little token
of my appreciation.</i>

1027
00:53:58.531 --> 00:54:01.659
Hi, Andy.
I'm gonna talk dirty to you.

1028
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:06.164
I want to have
lots of sexy sex with you.

1029
00:54:06.497 --> 00:54:10.626
I want to touch
your big, fat noodle

1030
00:54:10.752 --> 00:54:14.464
'cause I want to have
naughty intercourse with you.

1031
00:54:14.672 --> 00:54:18.801
I want you to put your penis on,
I mean, in me, Andy.

1032
00:54:18.885 --> 00:54:21.971
I want to do lots of,
lots of sexy,

1033
00:54:22.221 --> 00:54:25.057
hot things with you. Shit.

1034
00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:28.394
This really isn't working, Andy.
I don't know what to say

1035
00:54:28.978 --> 00:54:30.688
because I am you.

1036
00:54:32.565 --> 00:54:33.941
Okay. New tape.

1037
00:54:36.194 --> 00:54:39.030
<i>Nothing is ever good enough
and it's always our fault.</i>

1038
00:54:39.113 --> 00:54:40.948
<i>Hey, you can't speak
to your mother like that.</i>

1039
00:54:41.032 --> 00:54:42.909
<i>-You do.
-She's not my mother.</i>

1040
00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:49.874
I heard Dave gave you
the box of porn.

1041
00:54:50.583 --> 00:54:51.584
Yeah, he did.

1042
00:54:53.127 --> 00:54:54.837
You ever watch, like,
<i>Primetime Live</i>

1043
00:54:54.921 --> 00:54:56.798
when they take a black light
into a hotel room

1044
00:54:56.881 --> 00:54:59.425
and show you all the semen
all over the bedspread?

1045
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:01.302
Yeah.

1046
00:55:02.053 --> 00:55:03.721
You blind someone with that box.

1047
00:55:04.722 --> 00:55:06.641
Could see that thing from space.

1048
00:55:10.061 --> 00:55:12.647
This right here, you looking at
the Bentley of big screen TVs.

1049
00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:14.649
I'm talking about, this is
the Rolls-Royce of big screen...

1050
00:55:16.692 --> 00:55:19.195
Sometimes, I think these butterflies
are in here.

1051
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:21.656
I think he might be
fooling us all, though.

1052
00:55:21.739 --> 00:55:22.698
Really?

1053
00:55:22.782 --> 00:55:24.617
I actually think he might be,
like, some genius

1054
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.953
and this is like
some big, like, hilarious...

1055
00:55:27.036 --> 00:55:29.997
Like he's bored at work and he just
wanted to kick up some shit

1056
00:55:30.081 --> 00:55:31.290
so he told us all he's a virgin.

1057
00:55:31.374 --> 00:55:33.167
You're seeing a lot of stuff
that's not there.

1058
00:55:33.251 --> 00:55:35.461
You're just projecting all over him.

1059
00:55:35.878 --> 00:55:37.547
He might be an idiot savant

1060
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:40.633
but he's not, like, clever enough
to go that deep.

1061
00:55:40.716 --> 00:55:41.884
But he's got a great body.

1062
00:55:41.968 --> 00:55:44.387
-Would you fuck him?
-In a New York minute.

1063
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:46.138
-You would fuck him?
-Absolutely.

1064
00:55:48.391 --> 00:55:50.601
Hey, Andy, what are you doing
for lunch?

1065
00:55:50.685 --> 00:55:52.854
I don't know.
I have a turkey sandwich.

1066
00:55:52.937 --> 00:55:55.773
We're gonna go around the corner.
I think you should come with us.

1067
00:55:55.857 --> 00:55:58.651
There's this great place.
A lot of cute girls.

1068
00:55:59.068 --> 00:56:00.528
I don't know. Okay.

1069
00:56:01.445 --> 00:56:03.364
We brought you a shirt.

1070
00:56:03.781 --> 00:56:06.158
This place is pretty fancy.

1071
00:56:06.784 --> 00:56:07.827
Something going on?

1072
00:56:07.994 --> 00:56:10.121
<i>Hey, who's ready to have some fun?</i>

1073
00:56:11.914 --> 00:56:13.291
Hey, guys...

1074
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:17.211
No, don't ignore me.
I know what this is.

1075
00:56:17.295 --> 00:56:19.797
<i>Within one hour,
you'll each have 20 dates.</i>

1076
00:56:19.881 --> 00:56:23.092
Don't... Please don't do this.
I saw this on <i>Primetime Live</i>.

1077
00:56:23.259 --> 00:56:25.052
All right, ninja master.

1078
00:56:25.344 --> 00:56:27.096
We've given you all the advice
we have to give.

1079
00:56:27.179 --> 00:56:28.222
Now you gonna put it in action.

1080
00:56:28.306 --> 00:56:30.308
Advice? You guys all
gave me different advice.

1081
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:32.810
-He thinks you're a pothead.
-I am.

1082
00:56:32.894 --> 00:56:35.813
Dude. Hey, partner.
What are you whining about?

1083
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.149
-You asked for this shit.
-No, I didn't.

1084
00:56:38.232 --> 00:56:40.067
Will you just quit whining
like a bitch?

1085
00:56:40.151 --> 00:56:42.653
-I'm not whining like a bitch.
-You are whining like a bitch.

1086
00:56:42.737 --> 00:56:45.907
And you about to cram like
10 years of pimpage into one day.

1087
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:48.868
- I don't want to cram pimpage.
-Partner, after that

1088
00:56:49.035 --> 00:56:50.828
you on my level. Come on.

1089
00:56:50.912 --> 00:56:53.331
-Just ask questions.
-This is a bad idea.

1090
00:56:56.167 --> 00:56:57.418
-Hi.
-Hi. How are you?

1091
00:56:57.501 --> 00:56:58.711
I'm fine.

1092
00:57:00.087 --> 00:57:01.297
Are you fine?

1093
00:57:02.131 --> 00:57:03.174
Yeah.

1094
00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.676
You're fine then?

1095
00:57:06.385 --> 00:57:09.555
Are you fucking retarded?
What the hell's the matter with you?

1096
00:57:09.639 --> 00:57:10.932
Do you want me to be
fucking retarded?

1097
00:57:12.141 --> 00:57:14.894
When I look into the eyes
of the children and the parents

1098
00:57:14.977 --> 00:57:16.103
and they are smiling and saying,

1099
00:57:16.187 --> 00:57:18.564
"Thank you, Dr. Montalban,
you saved my child,"

1100
00:57:18.648 --> 00:57:19.982
it was worth it.

1101
00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:24.028
Amy,

1102
00:57:24.403 --> 00:57:26.530
-what are you doing here?
-David.

1103
00:57:28.115 --> 00:57:30.451
-And you are Gina?
-Gina.

1104
00:57:30.534 --> 00:57:32.203
-Hey, what's up?
-Nothing.

1105
00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:34.914
Look, I'm going to be
real honest with you.

1106
00:57:34.997 --> 00:57:37.458
It's been a long time
since I've been with a man.

1107
00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:40.211
Spent a lot of time with the ladies.

1108
00:57:40.294 --> 00:57:42.713
Looking to get back up
on that Pogo stick.

1109
00:57:42.797 --> 00:57:44.757
-You know what I'm saying?
-Excuse me.

1110
00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.803
Remember that time when we made love
and you cried in my arms?

1111
00:57:48.886 --> 00:57:51.305
Please don't reminisce about
the times we fucked, please.

1112
00:57:51.389 --> 00:57:53.224
-It's so creepy.
-Let's go to Paris.

1113
00:57:53.307 --> 00:57:56.143
I want to take you underneath the
Eiffel Tower and make love to you.

1114
00:57:56.227 --> 00:57:57.478
-Cut it out.
-Cut what out?

1115
00:57:57.561 --> 00:58:00.106
This, going to Paris! We've been
broken up for like two years, man.

1116
00:58:00.189 --> 00:58:01.607
I don't want to date you anymore.

1117
00:58:01.691 --> 00:58:03.401
-You're a whore.
-I am not a whore, all right?

1118
00:58:03.484 --> 00:58:04.986
Just 'cause I didn't like you.

1119
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:06.153
This is SO us.

1120
00:58:08.406 --> 00:58:10.032
-Psycho talk.
-What?

1121
00:58:10.116 --> 00:58:11.951
-You're a good-looking man.
-Thank you.

1122
00:58:12.034 --> 00:58:14.412
Very pretty.
Real soft, delicate features.

1123
00:58:14.495 --> 00:58:16.998
You're real feminine, you know,
which is good for me

1124
00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:19.709
because that would be
a simple sort of transition.

1125
00:58:19.792 --> 00:58:21.002
You know what I'm saying?

1126
00:58:21.085 --> 00:58:24.213
Maybe throw a little rouge on you,
tuck your sac back.

1127
00:58:24.296 --> 00:58:25.840
-You game?
-No.

1128
00:58:27.008 --> 00:58:30.720
You need to stop fucking around
with my friend, okay?

1129
00:58:30.803 --> 00:58:33.681
Because you're giving him hope,
and it's driving the man crazy.

1130
00:58:33.764 --> 00:58:36.809
I moved, I changed my e-mail
address, my phone number.

1131
00:58:36.892 --> 00:58:38.269
He's practically stalking me.

1132
00:58:38.352 --> 00:58:40.855
Well, I didn't know all that.
So, I'm sorry.

1133
00:58:42.106 --> 00:58:43.190
I love Minnesota.

1134
00:58:43.274 --> 00:58:45.860
I grew up in a town
outside of Minneapolis

1135
00:58:45.943 --> 00:58:48.779
with a population of, like,
500 people. Really small.

1136
00:58:48.863 --> 00:58:51.115
Yeah, it's like
the Land of a Thousand Lakes.

1137
00:58:51.198 --> 00:58:53.951
What about you? You're used
to, like, a really big city.

1138
00:58:54.035 --> 00:58:56.245
Really... God, yes.

1139
00:58:57.413 --> 00:59:00.750
The town that I grew up in
was really small. I mean,

1140
00:59:00.875 --> 00:59:03.711
you know, it was just so safe.
There was no crime.

1141
00:59:03.794 --> 00:59:07.089
I mean, a girl could just walk
from one end of town to the other

1142
00:59:07.173 --> 00:59:10.009
and just, you know,
feel completely safe.

1143
00:59:13.095 --> 00:59:14.346
She wasn't as hot as now.

1144
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:16.849
Spank bank
has once again been filled.

1145
00:59:18.059 --> 00:59:19.351
I'll tell you who's the hottest.

1146
00:59:19.435 --> 00:59:22.521
You're gonna think I'm crazy,
but I'm gonna tell you. Gina.

1147
00:59:22.938 --> 00:59:25.983
Can't get va-Gina out of my head.
Va-Gina all week.

1148
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:37.244
-You know what's a fun game?
-Huh?

1149
00:59:37.328 --> 00:59:39.163
You take three Excedrin PMs

1150
00:59:39.246 --> 00:59:41.707
and you see if you could whack off
before you fall asleep.

1151
00:59:43.959 --> 00:59:46.504
You always win
is the best part about the game.

1152
00:59:49.465 --> 00:59:50.841
-Are you Andy?
-Yeah.

1153
00:59:50.925 --> 00:59:52.760
Is this yours?
Did you write this stuff?

1154
00:59:52.843 --> 00:59:55.679
My girlfriend, Jill,
found your speed-dating card.

1155
00:59:56.347 --> 00:59:57.640
Yeah, right.

1156
00:59:57.723 --> 01:00:00.142
God, I've been looking
for that speed-dating card.

1157
01:00:00.226 --> 01:00:01.727
Thank you so much
for bringing it to me.

1158
01:00:01.811 --> 01:00:03.729
So, you actually wrote
that one girl looked like

1159
01:00:03.813 --> 01:00:05.981
she was "hurting for a squirting"?

1160
01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:08.984
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Hurting for a squirting,
I wrote that.

1161
01:00:09.068 --> 01:00:11.403
So you wrote "ho fo sho."

1162
01:00:12.196 --> 01:00:14.698
Yeah, I remember that girl.
She was a ho.

1163
01:00:15.366 --> 01:00:16.575
Fo sho.

1164
01:00:16.992 --> 01:00:18.828
Let me show you
how this device works.

1165
01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:20.621
Right, I'm just looking
for a cordless phone.

1166
01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:23.457
Yup, it's great. You can
do anything, make video diaries.

1167
01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:27.211
It's like, hey, Amy, how's it going?
How you feeling? I'm great.

1168
01:00:27.336 --> 01:00:29.964
I feel fantastic since we broke up.

1169
01:00:30.506 --> 01:00:32.133
I feel awesome!

1170
01:00:32.216 --> 01:00:34.844
Can you just show me the department
where there would be phones?

1171
01:00:34.927 --> 01:00:37.388
How have you been?
What's been going on...

1172
01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:40.266
I bet... Hey, have you been
doing a lot of this?

1173
01:00:41.559 --> 01:00:42.893
Sir, please, sir.

1174
01:00:42.977 --> 01:00:44.436
You are never gonna meet anybody

1175
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.148
with that kind of mentality about
women, you sick son of a bitch.

1176
01:00:47.231 --> 01:00:48.983
Who the fuck are you
to put me on trial?

1177
01:00:49.066 --> 01:00:50.693
I've never even met you.

1178
01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:52.987
So why don't you back the shit off,
all right?

1179
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:55.072
And stop with the inquisition.

1180
01:00:55.281 --> 01:00:56.448
That's how you talk?

1181
01:00:56.532 --> 01:00:58.284
You know what,
I don't have to answer to you.

1182
01:00:58.367 --> 01:00:59.994
You ain't my bitch.

1183
01:01:00.077 --> 01:01:01.620
Know what I saying?

1184
01:01:01.704 --> 01:01:04.165
So, shit, man. Fuck it.

1185
01:01:04.248 --> 01:01:06.125
You shouldn't even be hanging out
with this pervert.

1186
01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:08.335
I don't hang out with him.
I work with him and that's it.

1187
01:01:08.419 --> 01:01:10.087
I tried to introduce him
to a few nice people,

1188
01:01:10.171 --> 01:01:11.255
he made a fool of himself.

1189
01:01:11.338 --> 01:01:13.007
I don't mess with him, baby.
That's not me.

1190
01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:15.301
You should keep your ho on a leash.

1191
01:01:15.384 --> 01:01:17.011
-Bro, I can't let you...
-Hey.

1192
01:01:17.094 --> 01:01:19.263
I can't let you be talking
to my woman like that, dawg.

1193
01:01:19.346 --> 01:01:21.515
-Know what I'm saying?
-Bitch is running wild, man.

1194
01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:24.810
You miss that ass?
That's the ass of a free man.

1195
01:01:24.894 --> 01:01:27.229
That ass is going out tonight,
maybe to a club.

1196
01:01:27.313 --> 01:01:28.898
Maybe to a night club.

1197
01:01:29.106 --> 01:01:30.399
Hey, Andy,

1198
01:01:30.482 --> 01:01:32.818
-take a look at your pal.
-Oh, my God.

1199
01:01:32.902 --> 01:01:35.446
Yeah, he's performing
a public colonoscopy.

1200
01:01:35.529 --> 01:01:36.906
Isn't that sweet?

1201
01:01:36.989 --> 01:01:38.365
I'm gonna send David home
for the day

1202
01:01:38.449 --> 01:01:39.700
and you're gonna fill in for him.

1203
01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:41.493
-What? Selling things?
-You got that right.

1204
01:01:41.577 --> 01:01:42.620
I don't think that's a good idea.

1205
01:01:42.703 --> 01:01:44.371
And you're gonna have to
talk to people, too.

1206
01:01:44.455 --> 01:01:46.081
I know that's a frightening concept
to you

1207
01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:47.374
but I think you can handle it.

1208
01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:49.210
So get out there
and start selling some shit.

1209
01:01:49.293 --> 01:01:50.669
...thing for Amy.

1210
01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:52.379
-Hold it.
-Check it out.

1211
01:01:52.463 --> 01:01:53.881
I miss her.

1212
01:01:56.759 --> 01:01:58.719
Dude, the floor's
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

1213
01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.554
All you got to do
is go make your pick now.

1214
01:02:00.638 --> 01:02:03.015
-Come on, man.
-Okay.

1215
01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:05.768
And you could act
a little enthused about it.

1216
01:02:05.851 --> 01:02:06.977
Yeah.

1217
01:02:08.354 --> 01:02:11.565
That's right. That's right.
Gazelle in the pink top.

1218
01:02:12.816 --> 01:02:14.735
-Oh, shit.
-Hi.

1219
01:02:14.818 --> 01:02:16.570
Looks like you're checking out
digital cameras.

1220
01:02:16.654 --> 01:02:18.530
You know what,
he ain't going to do it willingly.

1221
01:02:18.614 --> 01:02:21.450
No. We need to, like,
really facilitate things a bit more.

1222
01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:23.077
-Yo, Andy.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1223
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.662
What's up, dude? This is Jay, man.

1224
01:02:24.745 --> 01:02:25.996
Hey, Jay.

1225
01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:27.539
I am throwing a party tonight.

1226
01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:29.333
It's gonna be real mellow,
just chilled up.

1227
01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:30.542
<i>Now, you really need to be there.</i>

1228
01:02:30.626 --> 01:02:33.170
It's gonna be
really, really colorful.

1229
01:02:33.671 --> 01:02:35.005
Are you free?

1230
01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:36.924
Yeah, I think so.

1231
01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:39.385
<i>That was a joke, man.
I know you're free.</i>

1232
01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.053
-I'm okay.
<i>-Gotta go, man.</i>

1233
01:02:41.136 --> 01:02:42.346
All right, bye.

1234
01:02:45.015 --> 01:02:47.142
So, tell me, Montel,

1235
01:02:47.518 --> 01:02:50.562
why weren't we invited to the party?
What are we, Al-Qaeda?

1236
01:02:50.646 --> 01:02:51.730
No, hold up.

1237
01:02:51.814 --> 01:02:53.983
-No, no.
-It's not that kind of party, y'all.

1238
01:02:54.066 --> 01:02:56.110
You're not coming
to our fucking party either, okay?

1239
01:02:56.193 --> 01:02:57.236
Fuck you, okay?

1240
01:02:57.319 --> 01:02:59.071
First of all,
it ain't that kind of party.

1241
01:02:59.154 --> 01:03:01.031
-Go fuck a goat.
-Yeah.

1242
01:03:01.156 --> 01:03:02.950
Why you always telling me
to fuck a goat, man?

1243
01:03:03.033 --> 01:03:04.159
Fuck a goat!

1244
01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:21.802
Hello?

1245
01:03:24.096 --> 01:03:25.222
Hello?

1246
01:03:27.057 --> 01:03:28.225
Hello.

1247
01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:31.562
Hello. Hi.

1248
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:35.065
-Are you here for Jay's party?
-Yes.

1249
01:03:35.441 --> 01:03:37.067
I am Jay's party.

1250
01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:41.989
You know what, hiring a transvestite
prostitute isn't helping me, man.

1251
01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:44.325
What? Ain't nobody hired
no damn transvestite.

1252
01:03:44.408 --> 01:03:45.451
What are you talking about?

1253
01:03:45.534 --> 01:03:47.328
She was really nice, incidentally.

1254
01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:49.163
If that sister was a transvestite

1255
01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:51.332
that was the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
of transvestites.

1256
01:03:51.415 --> 01:03:53.292
You got a hummer from the tranny,
didn't you?

1257
01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:56.670
You know, aren't we owed one now?
"Cause technically we paid her.

1258
01:03:56.754 --> 01:03:58.088
She had a dick, man.

1259
01:03:58.172 --> 01:03:59.840
Do you guys even like me?

1260
01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:03.344
Or is this some sort of cruel joke
that you're all in on?

1261
01:04:03.427 --> 01:04:05.721
Because I'm not a freak.
I'm a good person.

1262
01:04:05.804 --> 01:04:09.308
I always thought that Matt Damon
was like a Streisand, but

1263
01:04:09.933 --> 01:04:11.894
I think that he's rocking the shit
in this one.

1264
01:04:11.977 --> 01:04:13.687
Shut up, Dave!

1265
01:04:13.771 --> 01:04:17.649
Hold up. Let's just chill
on the aggression for a minute.

1266
01:04:18.067 --> 01:04:19.443
Look at him.

1267
01:04:19.777 --> 01:04:22.154
He is such a bad ass.

1268
01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:26.241
-He looks just like Luke Wilson.
-Mmm-hmm.

1269
01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:28.035
So you saying
she was definitely a man?

1270
01:04:28.118 --> 01:04:29.161
Yes.

1271
01:04:29.244 --> 01:04:31.330
Okay, well, how do you know
that she was a man?

1272
01:04:31.413 --> 01:04:34.333
Because her hands were
as big as André the Giant's.

1273
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:37.461
And she had an Adam's apple
as big as her balls.

1274
01:04:38.128 --> 01:04:39.630
So you have no proof.

1275
01:04:39.838 --> 01:04:41.673
You know what? Just leave me alone.

1276
01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:43.801
Just stay away from me.
Or I'm gonna tell Paula

1277
01:04:43.884 --> 01:04:46.387
that you're all stealing
the recordable CDs.

1278
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:49.139
-Come on.
-That's like we were paid to do it.

1279
01:04:49.223 --> 01:04:51.266
We did this
'cause we're your friends

1280
01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:54.103
and we didn't think you have
the balls to do it yourself.

1281
01:04:54.186 --> 01:04:55.479
-Really?
-Yeah.

1282
01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:57.022
Okay, watch this.

1283
01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.690
Yo, Andy, it's just CDs, man.

1284
01:04:58.774 --> 01:05:00.984
That's a third strike for me, dawg.

1285
01:05:24.258 --> 01:05:25.300
Hi.

1286
01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:28.178
-Andy. Hi.
-Right, yeah.

1287
01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:29.972
-You remember my name.
- I did.

1288
01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:32.558
-How you doing?
-I'm great. I like your store.

1289
01:05:32.683 --> 01:05:35.269
That's good, yeah. If you have time,
look around. It's...

1290
01:05:35.352 --> 01:05:36.437
Okay.

1291
01:05:36.937 --> 01:05:38.105
How's business been?

1292
01:05:38.188 --> 01:05:41.150
You know, it's coming along.
I mean, it takes a while.

1293
01:05:41.233 --> 01:05:44.278
-Do you want to go out sometime?
-Yes.

1294
01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:47.281
Yes, I would like that.
That would be great.

1295
01:05:47.364 --> 01:05:51.118
I think I'm maybe free this weekend,
if that's okay.

1296
01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:53.996
Or you could call me tomorrow
and we can just firm it up.

1297
01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.622
-Okay. Great.
-Great.

1298
01:05:55.706 --> 01:05:59.293
Okay, so I'll call you, and yeah,
that'll be good.

1299
01:05:59.376 --> 01:06:00.836
-How you doing?
-Congratulations.

1300
01:06:00.919 --> 01:06:02.838
Okay, so I'll... Yeah.

1301
01:06:03.172 --> 01:06:04.465
Can I help you?

1302
01:06:04.548 --> 01:06:07.050
Yeah, these are wonderful.
I'll take these.

1303
01:06:07.217 --> 01:06:10.888
Thanks, they are. They're great.
The goldfish just crack me up.

1304
01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:12.014
Funny.

1305
01:06:12.097 --> 01:06:13.182
-Yeah, they are.
-Yeah.

1306
01:06:13.265 --> 01:06:14.308
-Yeah.
-They're cute.

1307
01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:17.769
I don't actually sell anything here.
I just sell them on eBay.

1308
01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:19.730
I don't get it.

1309
01:06:19.897 --> 01:06:20.898
Okay.

1310
01:06:21.064 --> 01:06:23.984
-Can you help me?
-No, you're on your own here.

1311
01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:27.196
Good luck to you, and to you.
And ['ll give you a call.

1312
01:06:27.279 --> 01:06:30.282
-Great. Nice to see you.
-Great. Thanks for coming in.

1313
01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:31.909
Bye.

1314
01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:34.536
So, I guess I'll just
give you some money

1315
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.164
and you can give me
these shoes and...

1316
01:06:37.247 --> 01:06:39.917
You know,
I know it seems so strange.

1317
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.669
Yes. I'd just rather buy them
from you straight up.

1318
01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:44.671
Yeah, I know.
I wish it could be that easy, but...

1319
01:06:44.755 --> 01:06:48.008
I wish, too, but you're making it
extremely difficult for me.

1320
01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:50.219
I'm just trying to get these shoes
back to my house

1321
01:06:50.302 --> 01:06:51.553
so I can wear them.

1322
01:06:52.137 --> 01:06:54.806
<i>-I got a corpse in my way.
-Look out. Just kill it</i>

1323
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:57.935
That's just so not fair that
you have blades and...

1324
01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.895
I'm telling you, man, I feel great.

1325
01:06:59.978 --> 01:07:02.022
I'm so...
It's like a weight has been lifted.

1326
01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:05.692
Celibacy is the way to go, man.
Andy had it right, you know?

1327
01:07:05.776 --> 01:07:07.653
Look at him.
He looks younger than all of us

1328
01:07:07.736 --> 01:07:08.987
but he's 10 years older.

1329
01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:11.573
Why? Because he's
never had a relationship.

1330
01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:14.535
No she-devil sucked
his life force out yet.

1331
01:07:30.884 --> 01:07:33.220
-Hello?
-Hey. Hi. Hello.

1332
01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:34.846
Is this Trish?

1333
01:07:35.597 --> 01:07:37.766
-Who's calling, please?
-This is Andy.

1334
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:40.060
-Hi, Andy.
<i>-Hi, how you doing?</i>

1335
01:07:40.143 --> 01:07:43.105
-I'm good. How're you doing?
-I'm doing great.

1336
01:07:43.897 --> 01:07:47.150
-So you're gay, now?
-No, I'm not gay. I'm just celibate.

1337
01:07:47.859 --> 01:07:49.861
I think... I mean, that sounds gay.

1338
01:07:49.945 --> 01:07:52.823
I just want you to know that this is
the first conversation

1339
01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:56.326
of three conversations
that leads to you being gay.

1340
01:07:56.785 --> 01:07:59.371
There's this and then in a year
it's like, "You know,

1341
01:07:59.454 --> 01:08:02.583
"I'm kind of going to wanna get back
out there, but I think I like guys."

1342
01:08:02.666 --> 01:08:05.502
And then there's the big,
“I'm a gay guy now."

1343
01:08:05.794 --> 01:08:08.255
-You're gay for saying that.
-I'm gay for saying that?

1344
01:08:08.338 --> 01:08:10.924
-You know how I know you're gay?
-How? How do you know I'm gay?

1345
01:08:11.008 --> 01:08:13.468
"Cause you macraméd yourself
a pair of jean shorts.

1346
01:08:13.552 --> 01:08:14.636
You know how I know you're gay?

1347
01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.805
You just told me you're not sleeping
with women anymore.

1348
01:08:16.888 --> 01:08:18.432
-You know how I know you're gay?
-How?

1349
01:08:18.515 --> 01:08:21.602
"Cause you're gay and you can tell
who other gay people are?

1350
01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:23.186
-Do you know how I know you're gay?
-How?

1351
01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:24.730
You like Coldplay.

1352
01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:26.773
You're dead.

1353
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:29.234
Come on.

1354
01:08:29.318 --> 01:08:31.278
Leave my torso alone at least.

1355
01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:33.572
I also wanted to call

1356
01:08:33.655 --> 01:08:36.366
and see what night
you might want to go out.

1357
01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:38.327
I'm actually free tonight.

1358
01:08:40.329 --> 01:08:43.707
Okay. Well, no, I was thinking maybe
this weekend, but that's good. Okay.

1359
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:44.791
<i>Great.</i>

1360
01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:47.336
Okay, what time
do you want to pick me up?

1361
01:08:48.378 --> 01:08:49.713
Let's see.

1362
01:08:50.505 --> 01:08:54.092
That's actually kind of a problem
because I ride a bike.

1363
01:08:54.635 --> 01:08:55.761
<i>That's cool. Are you kidding me?</i>

1364
01:08:55.844 --> 01:08:57.471
I love getting on the back
of a motorcycle.

1365
01:08:57.554 --> 01:09:00.390
My boyfriend in college
drove a motorcycle.

1366
01:09:00.474 --> 01:09:02.267
<i>So, I mean, I'm cool.</i>

1367
01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:06.438
Yeah, I bet that was cool.
I ride a bicycle.

1368
01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:09.149
You know how I know that you're gay?

1369
01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:10.317
How?

1370
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.653
You like the movie
<i>Maid in Manhattan.</i>

1371
01:09:12.736 --> 01:09:14.237
-You know how I know you're gay?
-How?

1372
01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:17.491
I saw you make a spinach dip
in a loaf of sourdough bread once.

1373
01:09:17.574 --> 01:09:19.326
-You know how I know you're gay?
-How?

1374
01:09:19.409 --> 01:09:22.120
You have a rainbow bumper sticker
on your car that says,

1375
01:09:22.204 --> 01:09:24.414
"I love it
when balls are in my face."

1376
01:09:24.498 --> 01:09:25.582
That's gay?

1377
01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:27.042
God damn it!

1378
01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:30.045
I'm ripping your head off right now.
It's off.

1379
01:09:30.128 --> 01:09:32.631
And now I'm throwing it
at your body.

1380
01:09:33.548 --> 01:09:34.591
Fuck you!

1381
01:09:35.967 --> 01:09:37.094
You guys,

1382
01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:40.055
she's picking me up in an hour.

1383
01:09:41.098 --> 01:09:42.724
Ohh, drag, dude.

1384
01:09:43.266 --> 01:09:45.519
-She's picking you up from here?
-Yeah.

1385
01:09:45.602 --> 01:09:47.145
That's fucked up, man.

1386
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:48.855
-Why?
-Why?

1387
01:09:49.564 --> 01:09:52.984
Seriously. I mean,
look at this place, man.

1388
01:09:53.527 --> 01:09:56.780
You gotta see this through the eyes
of a woman, you know?

1389
01:09:56.863 --> 01:09:59.199
What is she going to think
when she comes in here? Look.

1390
01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:01.702
-He's got a billion toys.
-So what?

1391
01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:04.538
And more video games
than a teenaged Asian kid.

1392
01:10:04.621 --> 01:10:06.164
It's all right.

1393
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:09.626
Is that the
<i>Six Million Dollar Man's boss?</i>

1394
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.086
It's Oscar Goldman.

1395
01:10:11.169 --> 01:10:13.380
-Why do you have that?
-That's worth a lot of money.

1396
01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:15.424
That's much more valuable
than Steve Austin.

1397
01:10:15.507 --> 01:10:19.761
Well, that may be the case.
But none of this shit is sexy, okay?

1398
01:10:19.845 --> 01:10:21.555
I'm not trying to be sexy, man.

1399
01:10:21.638 --> 01:10:23.181
I mean, seriously, Asia.

1400
01:10:23.265 --> 01:10:25.100
You framed an Asia poster?

1401
01:10:25.183 --> 01:10:27.185
How hard did the people
at the frame store laugh

1402
01:10:27.269 --> 01:10:29.271
-when you brought this in?
-They did not laugh at me.

1403
01:10:29.354 --> 01:10:31.231
Know why you're gay?
Because you like Asia.

1404
01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:32.566
You guys cool it with the gay.

1405
01:10:32.649 --> 01:10:34.484
You know, she's on her way
over here, okay?

1406
01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:36.278
First, you relax, okay?

1407
01:10:36.361 --> 01:10:39.656
Just stop calming me down
and tell me what I should do.

1408
01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.908
Okay, we just take everything
that's embarrassing

1409
01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:43.076
and we move it out of here.

1410
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.036
So it doesn't look like
you live in Neverland Ranch.

1411
01:10:52.586 --> 01:10:53.795
-Hi.
-Hi. How are you?

1412
01:10:53.879 --> 01:10:54.921
Good.

1413
01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:56.965
So, you wanna head out?

1414
01:10:57.048 --> 01:10:58.925
Did you just move in or something?

1415
01:10:59.009 --> 01:11:01.261
No. Actually I'm getting
new carpet in.

1416
01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:03.722
I'm having carpet
put in tomorrow, so...

1417
01:11:05.182 --> 01:11:06.433
-Well, you know.
-Yeah.

1418
01:11:06.516 --> 01:11:08.185
-Okay.
-Looks good with the floors.

1419
01:11:08.268 --> 01:11:09.686
-Yeah.
-All right.

1420
01:11:10.187 --> 01:11:11.480
I should tear up the hard wood

1421
01:11:11.563 --> 01:11:13.690
and see if there's
carpet underneath.

1422
01:11:13.774 --> 01:11:15.650
That's never the case.

1423
01:11:18.987 --> 01:11:20.614
-This is gonna be fun.
-Yes.

1424
01:11:20.697 --> 01:11:22.616
You know,
I drive by this place every day.

1425
01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:24.409
I've never been in before.

1426
01:11:25.035 --> 01:11:26.286
I'm glad you came.

1427
01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:29.623
You know, I never really go out
with nice guys like you.

1428
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.418
I think I've avoided nice guys
like you my whole life

1429
01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:34.961
at my own peril.

1430
01:11:36.838 --> 01:11:39.382
-My last boyfriend drank a lot.
-Mmm-hmm.

1431
01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:41.259
-And so...
-This is just punch.

1432
01:11:42.427 --> 01:11:44.137
No, it's okay. A little bit's fine.

1433
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:46.473
Buddha punch. I need some Buddha.

1434
01:11:47.098 --> 01:11:49.559
Excuse me, miss.
Could you gather your team

1435
01:11:49.643 --> 01:11:52.395
and sing happy birthday
for my daughter, please?

1436
01:12:10.831 --> 01:12:13.542
-That was so good. What?
-That was great. Happy birthday.

1437
01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:15.585
-It's your birthday, too?
-No.

1438
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:17.754
-It's his birthday, too.
-No, no, no.

1439
01:12:17.838 --> 01:12:20.423
Could you sing for him
and bring him a cake?

1440
01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:22.008
Happy birthday.

1441
01:12:36.064 --> 01:12:38.441
-Thanks a lot.
-Happy birthday, Andy.

1442
01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:57.878
-You really like kissing, don't you?
-Yes.

1443
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:01.882
I really do.

1444
01:13:01.965 --> 01:13:03.717
Take off your pants, okay?

1445
01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:06.595
-Okay.
-Okay.

1446
01:13:09.097 --> 01:13:11.433
-Wow, this is really gonna happen.
-Oh, yeah.

1447
01:13:11.516 --> 01:13:12.976
Thank God.

1448
01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:17.564
-Okay, I'm taking off my pants.
-Yeah.

1449
01:13:17.939 --> 01:13:19.524
Do you need some help?

1450
01:13:19.774 --> 01:13:23.236
I think I almost got them.
It's hooked on my ankle.

1451
01:13:23.904 --> 01:13:25.488
Wow, that's...

1452
01:13:27.032 --> 01:13:28.867
Hey, wait. Do you have protection?

1453
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:30.619
I don't like guns.

1454
01:13:33.496 --> 01:13:35.081
That's funny.

1455
01:13:35.165 --> 01:13:37.500
I have condoms right here. Okay?

1456
01:13:37.584 --> 01:13:39.419
-Okay.
-There's, you know...

1457
01:13:39.502 --> 01:13:42.589
Check the expiration date because
they were from when I was married.

1458
01:13:42.672 --> 01:13:45.467
And we didn't have sex that often.
That's why there are so many, okay?

1459
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:46.676
Okay.

1460
01:13:51.014 --> 01:13:52.390
I got them.

1461
01:13:54.768 --> 01:13:56.394
How does this go?

1462
01:13:56.895 --> 01:14:01.608
Okay. "Roll over the tip
and down onto the base."

1463
01:14:03.526 --> 01:14:05.070
Over the balls?

1464
01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.197
It doesn't say.

1465
01:14:10.241 --> 01:14:12.452
Do you mind if I use your "Magnum"?

1466
01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:14.621
Yeah.

1467
01:14:16.498 --> 01:14:18.458
Wow. You got to be kidding.

1468
01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:20.877
I am Aquaman.

1469
01:14:22.879 --> 01:14:24.339
What is that?

1470
01:14:42.565 --> 01:14:43.608
Mom?

1471
01:14:44.734 --> 01:14:45.902
What's going on here?

1472
01:14:45.986 --> 01:14:47.904
-Who the hell are you?
-It's Andy.

1473
01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:49.030
Hi, I'm Andy.

1474
01:14:49.114 --> 01:14:50.615
God! What are you doing?

1475
01:14:50.699 --> 01:14:52.701
Marla, get the fuck out of my room!

1476
01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:53.827
You know what...

1477
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:56.454
I cannot believe that you're allowed
to have sex when I'm not!

1478
01:14:56.538 --> 01:14:58.456
-That is so unfair.
-I'm gonna head out.

1479
01:14:58.540 --> 01:14:59.541
You should go.

1480
01:14:59.624 --> 01:15:02.585
Oh, Jesus!
How many times did you just do it?

1481
01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:03.795
Oh, my God!

1482
01:15:06.256 --> 01:15:07.757
I'm so sorry.

1483
01:15:14.723 --> 01:15:16.641
Dude, teach me.

1484
01:15:26.943 --> 01:15:27.902
<i>Hotline.</i>

1485
01:15:27.986 --> 01:15:31.448
Hi, yes, I'm calling
because it's more than four hours

1486
01:15:31.531 --> 01:15:34.492
and your ad said to call
if it's been more than four hours.

1487
01:15:34.784 --> 01:15:36.619
<i>How much of the medicine
have you taken, sir?</i>

1488
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:40.165
I haven't taken any,
but your ad said

1489
01:15:40.248 --> 01:15:43.585
that if you've had an erection for
more than four hours, you call.

1490
01:15:44.169 --> 01:15:47.630
<i>You're only supposed to call
if you've taken the medicine.</i>

1491
01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:51.009
Okay. I'm sorry.
I must not have heard that part.

1492
01:15:51.092 --> 01:15:53.470
<i>Yes. If you haven't taken
the medicine, you don't call.</i>

1493
01:15:53.553 --> 01:15:55.722
Right. I'm sorry. Right.

1494
01:15:55.805 --> 01:15:57.932
So, there's nothing you can do?

1495
01:15:58.016 --> 01:15:59.809
-I just don't wanna...
<i>-There's nothing I can do.</i>

1496
01:15:59.893 --> 01:16:01.644
<i>I'm in Bombay, India.</i>

1497
01:16:02.228 --> 01:16:04.397
Okay. No, not you personally.
I just don't want,

1498
01:16:04.814 --> 01:16:06.441
I just don't want
to have an erection anymore.

1499
01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:11.029
<i>-You know, you could have sex.</i>
-Okay. Yup.

1500
01:16:11.863 --> 01:16:15.575
<i>That's one thing people do
when they have an erection.</i>

1501
01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:18.161
Yeah, that's not an option.
I don't have sex.

1502
01:16:18.286 --> 01:16:20.580
<i>Okay, well, then you can masturbate.</i>

1503
01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:22.332
I'd rather not masturbate.

1504
01:16:22.499 --> 01:16:25.460
If you'd like the erection
to go away, you can light a match,

1505
01:16:25.543 --> 01:16:29.714
<i>blow out the flame
and put the hot ember on your wrist.</i>

1506
01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:32.342
<i>And that will focus
the brain elsewhere</i>

1507
01:16:32.467 --> 01:16:34.969
<i>-and you will lose your erection.</i>
-Really? That'd work?

1508
01:16:35.178 --> 01:16:37.889
<i>Take your finger
and flick your testicle</i>

1509
01:16:37.972 --> 01:16:39.349
<i>and if you do that till it hurts</i>

1510
01:16:39.474 --> 01:16:41.518
<i>-your erection will go away.</i>
-Okay, all right.

1511
01:16:41.643 --> 01:16:43.103
<i>It sounds unpleasant and it is.</i>

1512
01:16:43.186 --> 01:16:45.396
<i>It is a trick we use in India.</i>

1513
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.691
Okay, those are all good pieces of
advice. I really appreciate it.

1514
01:16:49.025 --> 01:16:50.860
<i>We appreciate your business.</i>

1515
01:16:51.277 --> 01:16:53.446
<i>Oh, no.
We didn't get your business...</i>

1516
01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:56.741
No, not this time. I guess I didn't
need you this time. Thank you.

1517
01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:28.231
My goodness, Andy,
you are a terrific salesman.

1518
01:17:28.314 --> 01:17:30.650
-Thank you.
-Gosh, you really got it down.

1519
01:17:30.733 --> 01:17:32.402
-Thanks.
-And your numbers are good.

1520
01:17:32.485 --> 01:17:33.486
Thanks.

1521
01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:35.446
I'm going to put you out
on the floor full time.

1522
01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:36.489
-Really?
-Yeah.

1523
01:17:36.573 --> 01:17:37.615
Wow. Okay.

1524
01:17:37.699 --> 01:17:39.784
Good. We're gonna get you
a blue shirt and tie, all right?

1525
01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:40.910
Great. Thanks.

1526
01:17:40.994 --> 01:17:43.830
You know, Andy, I've been thinking
about your problem.

1527
01:17:43.913 --> 01:17:46.040
I think I might have
a solution for you.

1528
01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:50.253
You ever heard of the term
"fuck buddy"?

1529
01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:53.256
What?

1530
01:17:53.339 --> 01:17:55.800
It's a special friend

1531
01:17:56.676 --> 01:17:57.927
who you fuck.

1532
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:01.055
No, haven't heard that term.

1533
01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:04.100
When I was a little girl,
I developed early.

1534
01:18:04.767 --> 01:18:07.812
By the time I was 14,
I had this body you're looking at.

1535
01:18:07.896 --> 01:18:10.940
-Can you imagine that?
-I don't want to, no.

1536
01:18:11.566 --> 01:18:14.611
Well, needless to say,
a lot of male attention.

1537
01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:15.862
Like men, yes.

1538
01:18:15.945 --> 01:18:19.949
Especially from our
Guatemalan gardener, Javier.

1539
01:18:20.116 --> 01:18:21.242
Okay.

1540
01:18:21.618 --> 01:18:23.328
You know, Javier,

1541
01:18:24.204 --> 01:18:28.958
before he made passionate yet gentle
love to me for the first time

1542
01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:34.339
he serenaded me with a beautiful
old Guatemalan love song.

1543
01:18:34.422 --> 01:18:36.090
Really, that's...

1544
01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:38.718
That sounds nice.

1545
01:19:06.371 --> 01:19:07.455
Okay.

1546
01:19:08.915 --> 01:19:10.166
My goodness.

1547
01:19:10.625 --> 01:19:12.835
- I think we better get back to work.
-Yeah.

1548
01:19:12.919 --> 01:19:15.255
-Yeah, I better go back to work.
-Yeah.

1549
01:19:15.338 --> 01:19:17.173
-So, okay.
-All right.

1550
01:19:17.257 --> 01:19:19.050
So, you mull it over
and I'll talk to you soon.

1551
01:19:19.133 --> 01:19:21.344
-All right, I will. Thank you.
-Okay.

1552
01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:29.102
What's up, dawg? What happened?
How was the date with Trish?

1553
01:19:29.185 --> 01:19:31.312
-It was a disaster.
-Really?

1554
01:19:31.396 --> 01:19:34.190
Yes. I've never been
more embarrassed in my life.

1555
01:19:34.607 --> 01:19:36.609
Couldn't get the condoms to work.

1556
01:19:36.693 --> 01:19:39.112
And one of them
exploded on my balls.

1557
01:19:39.821 --> 01:19:41.572
And then her kid walked in the room.

1558
01:19:41.656 --> 01:19:42.699
Wait. Hold up.

1559
01:19:42.782 --> 01:19:44.158
She was hiding the kid
from you, dawg?

1560
01:19:44.242 --> 01:19:45.576
You know what, it doesn't matter

1561
01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:47.954
because it was going downhill
straight from there.

1562
01:19:48.037 --> 01:19:50.248
Listen, you don't want
no baby-daddy drama.

1563
01:19:50.331 --> 01:19:51.541
Trust me on this one, all right?

1564
01:19:51.624 --> 01:19:53.668
For all you know,
he in prison right now.

1565
01:19:53.751 --> 01:19:55.128
Let's say y'all living together.

1566
01:19:55.211 --> 01:19:58.131
Next thing you know, you the one
going on the 1st and the 15th

1567
01:19:58.214 --> 01:19:59.465
to pick up the government check.

1568
01:19:59.549 --> 01:20:01.634
What if he got boys
that's on the outside

1569
01:20:01.718 --> 01:20:02.802
and they stalking you?

1570
01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:04.762
You see what I'm saying?
You got to think, partner...

1571
01:20:04.846 --> 01:20:06.514
What the fuck are you talking about?

1572
01:20:06.597 --> 01:20:09.058
Here's what you do.
You tell her you're a virgin.

1573
01:20:09.142 --> 01:20:11.269
You test her with this shit, okay?

1574
01:20:11.352 --> 01:20:14.105
Here, tell me. Tell me.
This is how it's gonna go. Tell me.

1575
01:20:14.188 --> 01:20:15.982
-I'm a virgin.
-Sweet.

1576
01:20:16.482 --> 01:20:19.902
I like that because
you don't have chlamydia.

1577
01:20:21.112 --> 01:20:23.865
And I know that,
and that shit is everywhere.

1578
01:20:24.574 --> 01:20:26.159
What if she laughs at me, though?

1579
01:20:26.242 --> 01:20:28.453
Then you punch her
in the fucking head if she laughs.

1580
01:20:28.536 --> 01:20:31.080
I'm not going to punch her
in the head. She's really sweet.

1581
01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:34.709
No. I mean, you punch her
in her fucking head emotionally.

1582
01:20:34.792 --> 01:20:37.795
She's different.
She's someone I felt like I had

1583
01:20:37.879 --> 01:20:39.172
a connection with.

1584
01:20:39.255 --> 01:20:42.508
All you trying to do right now
is bust off this first nut.

1585
01:20:42.592 --> 01:20:45.136
You got a whole lot of semen
back up in you.

1586
01:20:45.219 --> 01:20:46.346
I am going to tell her.

1587
01:20:46.429 --> 01:20:48.264
-You should totally tell her, man.
-I'm going to.

1588
01:20:48.348 --> 01:20:50.558
"Cause I watched this movie
called <i>Liar Liar</i>

1589
01:20:50.641 --> 01:20:53.061
and the message was, "Don't lie."

1590
01:20:53.186 --> 01:20:55.063
And that was a smart movie.

1591
01:20:55.146 --> 01:20:56.606
-Yeah, that's the right thing.
-Yeah.

1592
01:20:57.398 --> 01:21:01.319
Really? All your girlfriends wanted
to have sex with virgins, too?

1593
01:21:01.986 --> 01:21:05.615
That's funny. I didn't even know
you girls talked like that.

1594
01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.369
I think my first time
might be your best time, too.

1595
01:21:10.203 --> 01:21:11.579
Well, I knew it. You know what,

1596
01:21:11.662 --> 01:21:14.749
I knew that you'd react that way
and I knew that

1597
01:21:14.999 --> 01:21:19.462
you would want to lead me
through my first sexual encounter

1598
01:21:19.796 --> 01:21:24.217
with all the compassion
and care that someone

1599
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:26.177
would give to their soul mate.

1600
01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:27.970
Oh, my God. I'm in trouble.

1601
01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:32.350
Hey, Andy.

1602
01:21:33.226 --> 01:21:34.644
You watching <i>Survivor</i> tonight?

1603
01:21:34.727 --> 01:21:37.188
No, actually I'm going out to dinner
with somebody.

1604
01:21:37.271 --> 01:21:38.523
Hi.

1605
01:21:38.689 --> 01:21:39.732
This is her.

1606
01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:41.984
-Trish, this is Joe and Sara.
-Hi.

1607
01:21:42.068 --> 01:21:43.236
-Hi, Trish.
-Hey.

1608
01:21:43.319 --> 01:21:44.821
But tape it for me, okay?

1609
01:21:44.904 --> 01:21:46.572
-Will do. All right.
-Thanks.

1610
01:21:46.656 --> 01:21:47.782
-So long.
-Bye-bye.

1611
01:21:47.865 --> 01:21:49.575
See you later. Have a good night.

1612
01:21:49.659 --> 01:21:52.036
Yeah, my man's gonna
get it on tonight.

1613
01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.121
-Yes, Sir.
-Mmm-hmm.

1614
01:21:53.204 --> 01:21:55.748
Yeah, and you better get on me, too.

1615
01:21:55.998 --> 01:21:57.917
What is wrong with this woman?

1616
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.252
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

1617
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:07.260
I'm so sorry that happened
the other night.

1618
01:22:07.343 --> 01:22:08.344
No, I'm sorry.

1619
01:22:08.428 --> 01:22:10.096
-Oh, my God.
-That was me.

1620
01:22:10.179 --> 01:22:11.222
No.

1621
01:22:11.889 --> 01:22:14.600
Let me...
I have something I want to tell you.

1622
01:22:15.518 --> 01:22:17.437
Kind of hard to talk about.

1623
01:22:18.396 --> 01:22:19.397
But,

1624
01:22:20.148 --> 01:22:23.192
you know,
there are certain things

1625
01:22:23.526 --> 01:22:25.862
about who I am that...

1626
01:22:26.362 --> 01:22:29.365
I'm sorry. I just have to get this
off my chest.

1627
01:22:29.449 --> 01:22:32.160
I am so sorry,
I didn't tell you I had kids.

1628
01:22:32.869 --> 01:22:34.704
Yeah, what was that about?

1629
01:22:34.787 --> 01:22:37.165
Gosh. You know,
that really surprised me.

1630
01:22:40.042 --> 01:22:41.961
No, you should have
told me probably, but...

1631
01:22:42.044 --> 01:22:43.004
I'm sorry. I know.

1632
01:22:43.087 --> 01:22:45.214
What do I care if you have a kid?

1633
01:22:45.673 --> 01:22:47.341
Well, I have two kids.

1634
01:22:48.217 --> 01:22:50.595
Wow. Okay. How old are they?

1635
01:22:51.596 --> 01:22:52.680
Six.

1636
01:22:53.389 --> 01:22:54.640
Sixteen.

1637
01:22:55.099 --> 01:22:56.476
Twenty-one.

1638
01:22:57.351 --> 01:22:58.686
Forty-two.

1639
01:22:59.562 --> 01:23:01.481
Fifty-six. How many kids
do you have?

1640
01:23:01.564 --> 01:23:03.399
-I have three.
-Okay, three.

1641
01:23:03.483 --> 01:23:05.485
Yeah, and one of them has a kid.

1642
01:23:05.568 --> 01:23:06.861
A one-year-old.

1643
01:23:07.195 --> 01:23:08.905
That's cool. That's great.

1644
01:23:10.907 --> 01:23:14.410
-I'm really glad we're doing this.
-Me, too.

1645
01:23:18.789 --> 01:23:20.333
Listen, Andy, I

1646
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:23.711
don't want to send you running
for the hills or anything, but

1647
01:23:23.794 --> 01:23:28.508
I really feel like if,
we decide to do this again, then

1648
01:23:30.635 --> 01:23:33.888
maybe we should hold off
on the physical part for a while.

1649
01:23:35.765 --> 01:23:38.100
That is a fantastic idea.

1650
01:23:38.935 --> 01:23:40.353
Why didn't I think of that?

1651
01:23:40.436 --> 01:23:41.687
-Really?
-Totally.

1652
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:45.024
-No sex?
-No. Why do that?

1653
01:23:45.107 --> 01:23:46.943
Because here's the thing.

1654
01:23:47.068 --> 01:23:48.236
From personal experience

1655
01:23:48.319 --> 01:23:51.030
I found that
sex can really complicate things.

1656
01:23:51.113 --> 01:23:54.200
And what we should be doing right
now is getting to know each other.

1657
01:23:54.283 --> 01:23:55.284
Yeah.

1658
01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:57.662
Well, I never thought
you'd go for it.

1659
01:23:57.745 --> 01:23:59.038
I'm going for it.

1660
01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:02.124
Well, that just
is a great, great notion.

1661
01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:04.168
Are you serious?

1662
01:24:04.252 --> 01:24:07.046
Look at my face.
Look at how serious I am.

1663
01:24:07.338 --> 01:24:09.048
Can you see my nostrils?

1664
01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:10.967
-Yes.
-That's serious.

1665
01:24:11.175 --> 01:24:12.635
That's more angry.

1666
01:24:13.094 --> 01:24:15.304
Yeah, you know what,
most guys would be saying,

1667
01:24:15.388 --> 01:24:18.599
"Yeah," right now, but, like,
by the third date, it would be,

1668
01:24:18.683 --> 01:24:22.228
"Hey, baby, I really need to
physically express how I feel"

1669
01:24:22.311 --> 01:24:24.647
-and all that stuff.
-Well, hey, baby,

1670
01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:27.817
you know, three dates.
Make it 10, 10 dates.

1671
01:24:29.694 --> 01:24:30.987
How about 157

1672
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:34.824
Fifteen. Screw your 15.
Twenty dates.

1673
01:24:35.074 --> 01:24:37.159
-Okay, 20 dates.
-Twenty dates.

1674
01:24:37.577 --> 01:24:39.787
-Okay.
-This is genius.

1675
01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:41.497
It's gonna hurt.

1676
01:24:43.499 --> 01:24:45.501
Not as much as you think.

1677
01:24:47.461 --> 01:24:49.338
We can really get to know
each other this way.

1678
01:24:49.422 --> 01:24:50.423
Yeah.

1679
01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.426
-This is one, right?
-No, next one.

1680
01:24:59.348 --> 01:25:01.267
Is it safe to come in,
or are you guys doing it?

1681
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:03.019
Honey, it's safe.

1682
01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:06.522
Great.

1683
01:25:06.606 --> 01:25:08.274
Well, good timing.

1684
01:25:08.608 --> 01:25:10.276
-Yeah.
-You remember Marla.

1685
01:25:10.359 --> 01:25:13.279
-Hi, we met.
-And this is my little bunny rabbit.

1686
01:25:13.362 --> 01:25:14.780
-Julia.
-Hey.

1687
01:25:14.864 --> 01:25:17.241
-This is Andy.
-Julia, how you doing?

1688
01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.787
You know what,
do you by any chance like magic?

1689
01:25:22.246 --> 01:25:24.749
-Yeah.
- I thought that you might.

1690
01:25:24.832 --> 01:25:26.292
Because I noticed on the way in

1691
01:25:26.375 --> 01:25:28.961
that you had something shiny
behind your ear.

1692
01:25:29.045 --> 01:25:31.464
Marla, did you see that?
Something behind her ear?

1693
01:25:31.547 --> 01:25:33.090
You think you do? Could I check?

1694
01:25:33.174 --> 01:25:35.468
Do you mind if I check
behind your ear?

1695
01:25:35.718 --> 01:25:37.053
Big money!

1696
01:25:38.512 --> 01:25:41.140
-That's amazing.
-Wow, it is amazing.

1697
01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:43.309
There's something else, too,
behind your ear, I think.

1698
01:25:43.392 --> 01:25:46.062
No, actually it's not behind
your ear. I think it is your ear.

1699
01:25:46.145 --> 01:25:47.146
Rip!

1700
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:50.650
It is your ear. There is your ear.

1701
01:25:50.733 --> 01:25:52.068
I ripped it off.

1702
01:25:52.151 --> 01:25:53.653
-Gross!
-Yeah, that's...

1703
01:25:53.736 --> 01:25:56.739
All right. Wait.
Okay, but that means that you

1704
01:25:56.822 --> 01:25:59.784
walk around with a rubber ear
in your pocket all day?

1705
01:26:00.743 --> 01:26:02.495
Yeah, like half the time.

1706
01:26:03.079 --> 01:26:04.622
You know,
I can come to your high school

1707
01:26:04.705 --> 01:26:06.666
and do it for your friends
if you want.

1708
01:26:06.749 --> 01:26:08.542
You know what, I should head out.

1709
01:26:08.626 --> 01:26:09.960
-Really?
-Yeah.

1710
01:26:10.044 --> 01:26:11.921
I have to give you a ride home.

1711
01:26:12.004 --> 01:26:13.214
Right. Yes, you do.

1712
01:26:13.297 --> 01:26:15.508
Yeah, 'cause you don't have
a car or anything, right?

1713
01:26:15.591 --> 01:26:17.176
Right, I don't have a car.

1714
01:26:17.259 --> 01:26:19.970
'Cause he doesn't have a car,
and he does magic.

1715
01:26:20.221 --> 01:26:21.263
Awesome.

1716
01:26:21.472 --> 01:26:24.058
And sarcasm is like
a second language to me.

1717
01:26:24.141 --> 01:26:26.227
So, I'm right there with you.

1718
01:26:29.105 --> 01:26:30.731
But, Dad,

1719
01:26:31.315 --> 01:26:34.694
I don't know how to love.

1720
01:26:35.486 --> 01:26:37.863
You never

1721
01:26:38.572 --> 01:26:41.158
taught me how...

1722
01:26:44.453 --> 01:26:46.330
-Hello.
-Hey, Cal.

1723
01:26:46.497 --> 01:26:48.708
<i>-Hey.</i>
- I just got back from the date.

1724
01:26:48.791 --> 01:26:50.918
<i>Did you tell her you're a virgin?</i>

1725
01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:53.379
No. I haven't gotten to that yet.

1726
01:26:53.462 --> 01:26:55.673
Really?
Are you having sex right now?

1727
01:26:55.881 --> 01:26:58.092
<i>No. She was incredible.</i>

1728
01:26:58.426 --> 01:27:00.720
She was amazing.
She didn't pressure me.

1729
01:27:00.803 --> 01:27:03.764
And she has three kids.

1730
01:27:03.848 --> 01:27:05.850
And one of her kids has a kid.

1731
01:27:08.102 --> 01:27:09.353
You all right?

1732
01:27:09.812 --> 01:27:14.066
Did you just say she has three kids,
one of whom has a kid?

1733
01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:16.569
-Yeah.
<i>-So, so, she's a grandma?</i>

1734
01:27:16.736 --> 01:27:17.737
No.

1735
01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:19.572
<i>I'm not a doctor
or anything like that</i>

1736
01:27:19.655 --> 01:27:21.824
but she's a fucking grandma.

1737
01:27:22.658 --> 01:27:24.243
Yeah, whatever, you know.

1738
01:27:24.326 --> 01:27:25.745
She's the hottest grandma
I ever saw.

1739
01:27:25.828 --> 01:27:27.246
<i>Yeah, she is. She's a hot grandma.</i>

1740
01:27:27.329 --> 01:27:30.040
That's a good-looking grandma.
My grandma looks like Jack Palance.

1741
01:27:30.124 --> 01:27:31.125
<i>Well she's no Jack Palance.</i>

1742
01:27:31.208 --> 01:27:32.918
No. If Jack Palance
looked like that lady

1743
01:27:33.002 --> 01:27:34.962
I would want to fuck Jack Palance
right now.

1744
01:27:35.045 --> 01:27:36.338
<i>Yeah, me, too.</i>

1745
01:27:36.672 --> 01:27:37.757
She's a hot grandma.

1746
01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.717
<i>Heck, yeah. No, do a grandma, man.</i>

1747
01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:42.595
You should fuck her
on her plastic-covered couch.

1748
01:27:43.637 --> 01:27:45.389
Fuck her while she watches
<i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

1749
01:27:45.473 --> 01:27:47.057
She would probably find that
very erotic.

1750
01:27:47.141 --> 01:27:48.350
Yeah, whatever, you know.

1751
01:27:48.434 --> 01:27:52.188
Fuck her and then have her send you
a check for $12 on your birthday.

1752
01:27:52.605 --> 01:27:54.857
I'm the dude with the hot granny.

1753
01:27:56.525 --> 01:27:57.985
What did you want
to talk to me about?

1754
01:27:58.068 --> 01:27:59.779
Well, Andy,
the numbers just came in

1755
01:27:59.862 --> 01:28:03.574
and you are by far
our best salesman.

1756
01:28:03.949 --> 01:28:06.327
So, I am promoting you
to floor manager.

1757
01:28:06.702 --> 01:28:08.496
This is the bullshit
of all bullshits!

1758
01:28:08.579 --> 01:28:10.539
You scumbag! Ass kisser!

1759
01:28:12.875 --> 01:28:14.585
Thank you. That's great.

1760
01:28:14.919 --> 01:28:18.672
-I understand you have a girlfriend.
-Yeah, kind of seeing somebody.

1761
01:28:19.089 --> 01:28:21.717
-I'm very happy for you.
-Thanks. She's great.

1762
01:28:21.884 --> 01:28:23.511
Are you still a virgin?

1763
01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.055
You know, I don't really

1764
01:28:26.138 --> 01:28:28.015
-talk about my personal life.
-You're a virgin.

1765
01:28:28.098 --> 01:28:29.475
-Yes, I am.
-Yeah.

1766
01:28:30.851 --> 01:28:32.561
My door is always open.

1767
01:28:33.187 --> 01:28:34.980
-So to speak.
-Great.

1768
01:28:36.482 --> 01:28:37.858
Great. Thank you.

1769
01:28:38.359 --> 01:28:40.319
I'm very discreet.

1770
01:28:43.113 --> 01:28:45.574
But I'll haunt your dreams.

1771
01:28:47.451 --> 01:28:48.828
-Okay.
-Okay.

1772
01:28:53.958 --> 01:28:54.959
Wow.

1773
01:28:57.419 --> 01:29:01.507
-So who's gonna take my job?
-Cal will be taking over your job.

1774
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:03.384
And he's interviewing people
right now

1775
01:29:03.467 --> 01:29:04.760
for his old job.

1776
01:29:04.844 --> 01:29:06.846
So, have you ever worked
with electronics before?

1777
01:29:06.929 --> 01:29:08.097
-No.
-No?

1778
01:29:08.305 --> 01:29:11.559
But I have electronics in my home.

1779
01:29:12.601 --> 01:29:16.605
Perfect. That's the job pretty much.
You're very well-qualified.

1780
01:29:17.231 --> 01:29:18.732
More than these other losers.

1781
01:29:20.276 --> 01:29:22.945
- I could do that...
-Wait, last thing.

1782
01:29:23.028 --> 01:29:25.030
I'm also gonna need that
extended warranty on it

1783
01:29:25.114 --> 01:29:27.449
for the price of "on the house."

1784
01:29:29.451 --> 01:29:30.703
That I can't do.

1785
01:29:30.786 --> 01:29:33.497
Hey, don't be a Negro. Be my nigger.
All right? Help me out.

1786
01:29:33.581 --> 01:29:35.624
Hold up. I ain't nobody's nigger.

1787
01:29:36.625 --> 01:29:39.378
I mean, you're somebody's nigger
wearing this nigger tie.

1788
01:29:39.461 --> 01:29:40.963
Now you being condescending.

1789
01:29:41.046 --> 01:29:44.550
See, you've been warned, all right?
Just move forward amicably.

1790
01:29:44.633 --> 01:29:45.968
Okay. Well, check this out.

1791
01:29:46.051 --> 01:29:48.137
First of all, you're throwing
too many big words at me.

1792
01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:49.889
Okay, now because
I don't understand them

1793
01:29:49.972 --> 01:29:51.432
I'm gonna take them as disrespect.

1794
01:29:51.515 --> 01:29:53.893
Watch your mouth,
and help me with the sale.

1795
01:29:53.976 --> 01:29:56.645
Okay, see,
now you found yourself a nigger.

1796
01:29:56.729 --> 01:29:59.565
You were looking for a nigger?
Nigger here now. See?

1797
01:29:59.648 --> 01:30:02.943
Today's forecast: Dark and cloudy,
and chance of drive-by.

1798
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:04.820
-You want to go”?
-I suggest you move back.

1799
01:30:04.904 --> 01:30:05.905
Then, nig, fire on.

1800
01:30:05.988 --> 01:30:07.823
Uh-oh. What are we gonna do?

1801
01:30:08.782 --> 01:30:11.744
What are you gonna do,
Mr. Floor Manager?

1802
01:30:12.953 --> 01:30:13.954
Go, get them, tiger.

1803
01:30:14.246 --> 01:30:15.331
This shit just got rigged.

1804
01:30:15.414 --> 01:30:17.249
-What are you gonna do, bitch?
-I'll tell you what.

1805
01:30:17.333 --> 01:30:19.793
You know Luca Perry
from 20th and 25th?

1806
01:30:19.877 --> 01:30:21.712
You ever heard of,
Rolling 20s, nigger?

1807
01:30:21.795 --> 01:30:24.256
Since I was 16, nigger,
I'm saying "frosty."

1808
01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:25.758
You know what I'm saying,
"spoon,"” nigger.

1809
01:30:25.841 --> 01:30:27.176
We fucked dwarfs in the ass.

1810
01:30:27.259 --> 01:30:28.928
Nigger, this dwarf here don't got to
be tall

1811
01:30:29.011 --> 01:30:30.888
to pull the trigger off
in somebody face!

1812
01:30:30.971 --> 01:30:33.223
-Come on nigger, back up. What's up?
-Hey,

1813
01:30:33.307 --> 01:30:34.683
welcome to Smart Tech.

1814
01:30:34.767 --> 01:30:36.310
-Is this your boy?
-What can I help you with?

1815
01:30:36.393 --> 01:30:37.937
Yeah, nigger, we will both mash you!

1816
01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:40.022
-How can we help you, sir?
-Nigger, what?

1817
01:30:40.105 --> 01:30:42.274
No, he don't need no help.
He's already been served.

1818
01:30:42.358 --> 01:30:45.319
I served him. He's taken care of.
He's a little slow, but he got it.

1819
01:30:45.402 --> 01:30:47.988
See, what he thought was he can
come up in here and make the rules.

1820
01:30:48.072 --> 01:30:50.658
But now he see that
Jay make the rules at Smart Tech,

1821
01:30:50.741 --> 01:30:53.535
that I run this bitch,
and now he about to bounce.

1822
01:30:55.162 --> 01:30:56.163
This your boy?

1823
01:30:56.288 --> 01:30:58.832
Yeah, that's my boy.
We represent Smart Tech.

1824
01:30:58.916 --> 01:31:00.334
You just got fucked up with him.

1825
01:31:00.417 --> 01:31:02.670
Both y'all niggers going
get clapped up when I get back.

1826
01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:05.130
Both of you all niggers.

1827
01:31:05.381 --> 01:31:07.508
-What did I do?
-It don't fucking matter!

1828
01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.179
-Yeah, aim high, Willis. Aim high!
-Please don't do this.

1829
01:31:13.389 --> 01:31:15.391
Jay, what's going on?

1830
01:31:17.226 --> 01:31:18.560
Jill broke up with me.

1831
01:31:18.894 --> 01:31:21.605
I'm so sorry. What happened?

1832
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:23.649
I came home a little tipsy.

1833
01:31:23.732 --> 01:31:26.110
And I had
one of my condoms on still.

1834
01:31:28.153 --> 01:31:31.407
Woke up the next morning
and jumped in the shower with her.

1835
01:31:32.408 --> 01:31:34.326
I don't know what I was thinking.

1836
01:31:34.410 --> 01:31:35.619
Why did you cheat on her?

1837
01:31:35.703 --> 01:31:37.997
Because I'm insecure!
You can't tell?

1838
01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.457
I know, man. It's gonna be okay.

1839
01:31:40.541 --> 01:31:42.668
-I'm cold.
-It's gonna be all right, man.

1840
01:31:42.751 --> 01:31:44.461
Seriously, man, I'm sorry.

1841
01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:46.380
I apologize to you. I know.

1842
01:31:46.463 --> 01:31:48.298
If you wanna have
a meaningful relationship

1843
01:31:48.382 --> 01:31:50.592
you've got to leave the sex
out of it, man. You're right.

1844
01:31:50.676 --> 01:31:51.844
It's all right. You're good.

1845
01:31:51.927 --> 01:31:53.762
I'm sorry. Come here.
I love you, man.

1846
01:31:53.846 --> 01:31:55.347
Man, I love you, too.

1847
01:31:56.557 --> 01:31:58.225
You're a good guy.

1848
01:32:00.352 --> 01:32:02.771
Do you know how I know
you guys are gay?

1849
01:32:02.855 --> 01:32:05.274
You're holding each other
ever so gently.

1850
01:32:05.357 --> 01:32:06.400
<i>Cabrón.</i>

1851
01:32:12.865 --> 01:32:13.949
Bravo.

1852
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:16.160
At least he can cook, Mom.

1853
01:32:20.205 --> 01:32:22.833
I love Spiderman.

1854
01:32:36.138 --> 01:32:37.973
Pull out slowly
and go straight ahead.

1855
01:33:07.086 --> 01:33:08.337
I'm all right.

1856
01:33:08.754 --> 01:33:10.047
Nobody's there.

1857
01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:12.257
I want to know everything about you.

1858
01:33:12.341 --> 01:33:13.383
I want to tell you.

1859
01:33:13.467 --> 01:33:14.468
-You do?
-Yeah.

1860
01:33:14.551 --> 01:33:17.387
Like, what do you want to do?
What are your dreams?

1861
01:33:17.805 --> 01:33:21.183
You don't wanna work at Smart Tech
for the rest of your life.

1862
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:23.435
I've been working there
for a long time.

1863
01:33:23.519 --> 01:33:27.231
And I've been thinking lately that
maybe I should open my own store.

1864
01:33:27.439 --> 01:33:28.482
-Really?
-Yeah.

1865
01:33:28.565 --> 01:33:32.027
-What kind of store?
-Well, like a stereo store.

1866
01:33:32.152 --> 01:33:34.488
Oh, my God, that is...
Why don't you do that?

1867
01:33:34.571 --> 01:33:36.240
I don't have enough money
to do that.

1868
01:33:36.323 --> 01:33:37.783
What about those collectibles?

1869
01:33:37.866 --> 01:33:40.119
I bet if you sold those,
you could make a lot of money.

1870
01:33:40.202 --> 01:33:44.039
I just sold a guy's G. I. Joe
for $1,000.

1871
01:33:44.373 --> 01:33:45.833
-Really?
-Do you have any of those?

1872
01:33:45.916 --> 01:33:47.042
-Yeah.
-You do?

1873
01:33:47.126 --> 01:33:48.168
I have 47 of them.

1874
01:33:48.252 --> 01:33:49.461
No, you don't.

1875
01:33:49.545 --> 01:33:51.505
-Yeah, in their original boxes.
-You do?

1876
01:33:51.588 --> 01:33:53.674
I could help you sell them on eBay.

1877
01:33:53.757 --> 01:33:56.844
I would not take a commission,
I swear to God.

1878
01:33:56.927 --> 01:34:00.013
You could do it.
You could totally pull it off.

1879
01:34:01.473 --> 01:34:03.517
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Let's do it.

1880
01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:22.870
Aquaman.

1881
01:34:23.287 --> 01:34:24.413
Here.

1882
01:34:24.872 --> 01:34:26.248
Gloves on.

1883
01:34:28.041 --> 01:34:29.918
I'll send you off to

1884
01:34:31.003 --> 01:34:33.922
a farm with lots of land.

1885
01:34:34.006 --> 01:34:36.800
So, you and other Aquamen
can run around

1886
01:34:37.926 --> 01:34:40.387
and play in the Aquafields.

1887
01:34:50.606 --> 01:34:52.608
Godspeed, Col. Steve Austin.

1888
01:34:55.569 --> 01:34:57.487
You don't wanna go, do you?
Okay, you can stay.

1889
01:34:57.571 --> 01:34:59.448
Steve Austin can stay.

1890
01:35:03.035 --> 01:35:05.037
Hey, Cal. David.

1891
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.624
-Way to sell a big TV.
-She likes you, man.

1892
01:35:08.957 --> 01:35:10.834
Too bad I retired my penis.

1893
01:35:11.418 --> 01:35:14.463
Mooj, we try to be fair with
the schedule but it's hard.

1894
01:35:14.755 --> 01:35:18.133
Okay, but why every damn schedule
comes up, I get most early shift?

1895
01:35:18.217 --> 01:35:21.303
It's bullshit. Nobody buys stereo
at 10:00 in the morning.

1896
01:35:21.386 --> 01:35:22.387
No, I understand.

1897
01:35:22.471 --> 01:35:25.307
People buy stereo
between 6:00 and 8:00.

1898
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:26.391
Mmm-hmm.

1899
01:35:26.475 --> 01:35:29.937
Rich men get off work,
then buy stereo.

1900
01:35:30.062 --> 01:35:32.773
-Right.
-Not after fucking brunch.

1901
01:35:32.856 --> 01:35:34.149
Okay. Here's what we're gonna do.

1902
01:35:34.233 --> 01:35:36.777
I'm going to give you
a couple of Jay's shifts.

1903
01:35:37.069 --> 01:35:39.738
And then I'll give you
a couple of mine and that way

1904
01:35:39.821 --> 01:35:42.991
-we'll all be equal, okay.
-Thank you, Andy.

1905
01:35:43.367 --> 01:35:46.036
-It's okay.
-You're a good man, Andy.

1906
01:35:48.455 --> 01:35:51.541
By the way,
what date are you on, now?

1907
01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:54.419
I think it's around 17.

1908
01:35:54.503 --> 01:35:57.256
It's hard to tell what actually
constitutes a date, though.

1909
01:35:57.339 --> 01:36:00.884
Three to go. So that means
you're gonna have sex in three days.

1910
01:36:01.927 --> 01:36:04.137
Maybe, I might try
to space them out a little bit.

1911
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:06.848
-I'll pray for your cock.
-Okay, thanks.

1912
01:36:07.099 --> 01:36:09.017
-Thanks. Thank you.
-Have a good cocky.

1913
01:36:09.309 --> 01:36:11.937
Trish is on the phone.
Here is a shock.

1914
01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:13.855
-Girlfriend with a problem.
-Hello.

1915
01:36:14.231 --> 01:36:16.358
<i>I have done everything but sex!</i>

1916
01:36:16.441 --> 01:36:18.986
<i>I'm a woman, okay? Deal with it!</i>

1917
01:36:19.069 --> 01:36:21.154
I'm gonna start
taking you back to church.

1918
01:36:21.238 --> 01:36:23.198
We are gonna start going to church.

1919
01:36:23.282 --> 01:36:24.783
-Hello?
-You know what?

1920
01:36:24.866 --> 01:36:26.159
What the hell are you talking about?

1921
01:36:26.243 --> 01:36:28.912
Oh, my God, I cannot believe this.
Thank God you're here.

1922
01:36:28.996 --> 01:36:31.957
Jesus Christ. Marla locked herself
in the bathroom.

1923
01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.000
What happened?

1924
01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:34.793
She wants to go
to the family health clinic.

1925
01:36:34.876 --> 01:36:36.962
She wants birth control.
But she's too young.

1926
01:36:37.045 --> 01:36:40.257
I want to have sex
with my boyfriend! But I can't, Mom!

1927
01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.591
So, you want me to take her?

1928
01:36:41.675 --> 01:36:43.760
-No, I don't want you to take her.
-Okay, all right.

1929
01:36:43.844 --> 01:36:47.222
I want her to keep it in her pants
until she gets to college.

1930
01:36:47.806 --> 01:36:49.141
"Keep it in my pants?"

1931
01:36:49.224 --> 01:36:51.810
Okay, you didn't keep it
in your pants, Mom.

1932
01:36:51.893 --> 01:36:55.355
I know. I don't want you to make
the same mistakes as me, Marla.

1933
01:36:55.439 --> 01:36:58.483
Mistakes?
Okay, so I was a mistake then.

1934
01:36:58.567 --> 01:37:02.487
No, you're not a mistake.
Your sister was the mistake.

1935
01:37:03.196 --> 01:37:04.698
Oh, my God!

1936
01:37:05.073 --> 01:37:07.909
Her older sister, I mean, she wasn't
planned, you know what I mean?

1937
01:37:07.993 --> 01:37:10.495
Because I was such a... Oh, God,
you wanna run away, don't you?

1938
01:37:10.579 --> 01:37:11.663
No.

1939
01:37:11.747 --> 01:37:14.541
You and your boyfriend
have sex all the time!

1940
01:37:14.624 --> 01:37:16.335
Oh, my God! Are you kidding?

1941
01:37:16.418 --> 01:37:18.253
We never have sex.
Do we ever have sex?

1942
01:37:18.337 --> 01:37:19.671
No, we don't.

1943
01:37:19.921 --> 01:37:21.757
What? Yes, you do!

1944
01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.509
You're such a liar!
Why do you lie to me?

1945
01:37:24.593 --> 01:37:25.594
Why?

1946
01:37:29.181 --> 01:37:31.141
I didn't hear anything
after "a liar."

1947
01:37:31.224 --> 01:37:34.019
-What did she say after "a liar"?
-She sounds like a tea kettle.

1948
01:37:34.102 --> 01:37:36.021
Fuck you!

1949
01:37:38.315 --> 01:37:40.817
-Maybe I should take her.
-No, I don't think so.

1950
01:37:40.901 --> 01:37:43.320
You know, a little information
never hurt anybody.

1951
01:37:57.376 --> 01:37:58.460
Cool.

1952
01:37:59.503 --> 01:38:00.587
Wow!

1953
01:38:03.048 --> 01:38:05.133
Where do you put the penis?

1954
01:38:06.134 --> 01:38:07.427
Oh, shit.

1955
01:38:17.813 --> 01:38:20.107
It is

1956
01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:21.608
not a Rubik's Cube.

1957
01:38:23.819 --> 01:38:25.570
Shit.

1958
01:38:27.322 --> 01:38:29.324
God, how much longer
are they gonna make us wait?

1959
01:38:29.408 --> 01:38:31.827
I don't know. They should be
out in a second.

1960
01:38:32.327 --> 01:38:33.412
Now, you're all here

1961
01:38:33.495 --> 01:38:35.872
because you're interested
in obtaining birth control.

1962
01:38:35.956 --> 01:38:37.207
Any questions?

1963
01:38:37.833 --> 01:38:40.168
Here's a cute story.
I came home the other day

1964
01:38:40.252 --> 01:38:43.213
and he is with his girlfriend
in my marital bed

1965
01:38:43.296 --> 01:38:46.216
doing things that are illegal
in Alabama.

1966
01:38:46.299 --> 01:38:49.594
Sex acts, right?
Things that my wife won't do, okay?

1967
01:38:50.053 --> 01:38:52.931
-Did you have a question?
-How do I get my wife to do that?

1968
01:38:53.014 --> 01:38:54.307
Does anybody else have a question?

1969
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:57.727
My daughter is,
for lack of a better word,

1970
01:38:58.186 --> 01:38:59.271
dumb.

1971
01:38:59.688 --> 01:39:01.731
How do I stop her menstrual cycle?

1972
01:39:01.815 --> 01:39:04.067
You want her to stop
having a menstrual cycle?

1973
01:39:04.151 --> 01:39:06.778
I want to stop it,
maybe just for a few years.

1974
01:39:06.862 --> 01:39:09.072
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

1975
01:39:09.156 --> 01:39:12.242
-Does anybody else have a question?
-I have a question.

1976
01:39:12.325 --> 01:39:16.163
I think some of the people here
might be sexually inexperienced.

1977
01:39:16.746 --> 01:39:19.833
Is it true that if you don't use it,
you lose it?

1978
01:39:20.292 --> 01:39:21.918
Is that a serious question?

1979
01:39:22.002 --> 01:39:23.628
-No. It wasn't.
-Okay.

1980
01:39:24.129 --> 01:39:27.757
Now, there are a lot of activities
that you can engage in

1981
01:39:27.841 --> 01:39:30.635
without having sex
that are both fun and safe.

1982
01:39:30.719 --> 01:39:32.804
What sort of activities? I think

1983
01:39:32.888 --> 01:39:35.140
everybody wants to know
about the activities.

1984
01:39:35.223 --> 01:39:39.769
Well, instead of having intercourse,
you could have outer-course.

1985
01:39:40.353 --> 01:39:42.481
Outer-course? What's that?

1986
01:39:42.564 --> 01:39:43.940
Yeah, what is that?

1987
01:39:44.024 --> 01:39:48.153
Outer-course is anything
that isn't vaginal intercourse.

1988
01:39:48.361 --> 01:39:50.363
I prefer vaginal intercourse.

1989
01:39:52.032 --> 01:39:53.325
He really does.

1990
01:39:53.658 --> 01:39:57.245
Now, there are ways of having sex
without intercourse.

1991
01:39:58.371 --> 01:40:01.750
Let's see, there are things
like body rubbing or dry humping.

1992
01:40:01.833 --> 01:40:03.168
You could dry hump.

1993
01:40:03.251 --> 01:40:06.338
-There is masturbation.
-Masturbation. Play with yourself.

1994
01:40:06.421 --> 01:40:08.465
-Mutual masturbation.
-Play with a friend.

1995
01:40:08.548 --> 01:40:12.135
Deep kissing.
There is erotic massage.

1996
01:40:12.219 --> 01:40:14.054
That sounds like it would be nice.

1997
01:40:14.137 --> 01:40:16.723
-Oral sex play.
-Sounds like my Friday night.

1998
01:40:16.806 --> 01:40:18.683
Shut up, Seth. We went to temple.

1999
01:40:18.767 --> 01:40:20.560
Okay, are there any virgins here

2000
01:40:20.644 --> 01:40:23.605
who are thinking about having sex
for the first time?

2001
01:40:26.191 --> 01:40:28.318
Wait. So you're a virgin?

2002
01:40:30.779 --> 01:40:33.615
-I'd tap that.
-Oh, yeah, you'd "tap that"?

2003
01:40:33.698 --> 01:40:36.660
Seth, what, you think you're cool
with your little Jew fro?

2004
01:40:36.743 --> 01:40:39.955
We don't say, "tap that."
What are you talking about, Seth?

2005
01:40:40.038 --> 01:40:42.457
You know what, I'm a virgin, too.

2006
01:40:44.376 --> 01:40:45.502
That's...

2007
01:40:45.585 --> 01:40:47.462
-We're virgins, too.
-Yeah.

2008
01:40:49.381 --> 01:40:52.342
No, you know what,
it's a personal choice

2009
01:40:52.425 --> 01:40:53.927
and I don't think it's weird at all.

2010
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.262
You know what your problem is?

2011
01:40:55.345 --> 01:40:57.055
You're putting the pussy
on a pedestal.

2012
01:40:57.138 --> 01:40:58.890
That's the second time
I've heard that.

2013
01:40:58.974 --> 01:41:00.892
What is the
"pussy on a pedestal” thing?

2014
01:41:00.976 --> 01:41:04.771
Okay, I can't listen to any more
of this, 'cause it's making me sick.

2015
01:41:04.854 --> 01:41:05.897
So, bye.

2016
01:41:05.981 --> 01:41:08.108
You can get this information
on your website, right?

2017
01:41:08.191 --> 01:41:09.901
-Yes.
-Thanks. Nice meeting everybody.

2018
01:41:09.985 --> 01:41:11.111
Any other questions?

2019
01:41:11.194 --> 01:41:13.113
Do you have any extra-large condoms?

2020
01:41:13.196 --> 01:41:15.282
Seth, you got a tiny penis.

2021
01:41:19.327 --> 01:41:22.455
So, I made that all up
to help you out.

2022
01:41:24.332 --> 01:41:25.875
No, you didn't.

2023
01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:29.546
But thank you for doing that.

2024
01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:33.967
How can you tell?

2025
01:41:34.342 --> 01:41:36.553
Well, you know, I go to school with,
like, 400 guys

2026
01:41:36.636 --> 01:41:38.054
who are all trying to have sex.

2027
01:41:38.138 --> 01:41:40.098
And, yeah,
so I can tell who's done it.

2028
01:41:40.181 --> 01:41:41.224
Of course.

2029
01:41:41.308 --> 01:41:44.185
-And you really haven't?
-No, I really haven't.

2030
01:41:44.686 --> 01:41:47.105
Please don't tell your mom, okay?

2031
01:41:47.188 --> 01:41:48.940
-Yeah, I won't.
-Thanks.

2032
01:41:49.024 --> 01:41:52.193
But when are you gonna tell her?

2033
01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:54.362
Believe me, I'm working on it.

2034
01:41:55.697 --> 01:41:57.449
I am working on it.

2035
01:42:00.619 --> 01:42:01.911
Do you have any weed?

2036
01:42:03.622 --> 01:42:04.789
-Yeah.
-You do have some.

2037
01:42:04.873 --> 01:42:07.292
Can you spare any
or is it all spoken for?

2038
01:42:07.876 --> 01:42:09.961
I mean, like what are we talking?
Are we...

2039
01:42:10.045 --> 01:42:12.005
Just enough to get me
baked for like a week.

2040
01:42:12.464 --> 01:42:13.465
That's a lot of weed.

2041
01:42:13.548 --> 01:42:15.342
Yeah, I am taking vacation
next week, so...

2042
01:42:15.759 --> 01:42:17.427
-Where are you going?
-I'm not going anywhere.

2043
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:19.220
-I'll stay in my apartment.
-Just getting baked?

2044
01:42:19.304 --> 01:42:20.722
I want to be baked the whole time.

2045
01:42:21.181 --> 01:42:23.433
Watch TV,
I'll probably re-watch <i>Gandhi</i>.

2046
01:42:24.267 --> 01:42:26.144
-<i>Gandhi</i> baked is good.
-Yes, isn't it?

2047
01:42:26.227 --> 01:42:27.729
I always feel bad
when I watch it baked

2048
01:42:27.812 --> 01:42:29.606
'cause I get really hungry
and I'm eating a lot

2049
01:42:29.689 --> 01:42:30.649
and poor Gandhi is

2050
01:42:30.732 --> 01:42:32.734
-fucking starving his ass off.
-Starving, I know.

2051
01:42:36.404 --> 01:42:37.864
-Sounds good.
-Yeah.

2052
01:42:37.947 --> 01:42:40.533
I'm going to take her to capacity.
Are you okay with that?

2053
01:42:40.617 --> 01:42:41.993
Give it a shot.

2054
01:42:42.077 --> 01:42:44.496
Freak! Oh, yeah!

2055
01:42:45.914 --> 01:42:48.500
Michael McDonald, man,
I haven't heard this in years.

2056
01:42:48.583 --> 01:42:50.627
Yeah, I haven't heard it
in like 48 minutes.

2057
01:42:51.586 --> 01:42:54.172
If I get the set,
will you throw in the DVD?

2058
01:42:54.255 --> 01:42:56.591
You don't get the set.
I'll throw in the DVD.

2059
01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:58.051
I'll take it.

2060
01:42:58.176 --> 01:42:59.636
-Really?
-Yeah.

2061
01:43:01.137 --> 01:43:03.264
Y'all want to see
something beautiful? Come here.

2062
01:43:03.348 --> 01:43:06.393
You want to see the most beautiful
thing in the world? Check this out.

2063
01:43:06.476 --> 01:43:10.230
This is my baby right here.
That's my baby's dick right there.

2064
01:43:10.855 --> 01:43:12.607
Looks like a poltergeist.

2065
01:43:12.899 --> 01:43:14.192
That is his foot.

2066
01:43:14.275 --> 01:43:16.569
Look at his dick.
That's not even four months.

2067
01:43:16.653 --> 01:43:17.987
Extrapolate that.

2068
01:43:18.071 --> 01:43:20.407
By the time he's 30,
what's gonna happen?

2069
01:43:20.490 --> 01:43:22.784
Yo, Andy! Come check this out, dawg.

2070
01:43:22.867 --> 01:43:25.412
Is this the movie about babies
that are geniuses?

2071
01:43:25.495 --> 01:43:27.997
No, this is my child, dude.
Jill is pregnant.

2072
01:43:28.081 --> 01:43:29.207
-That's yours?
-Yeah.

2073
01:43:29.290 --> 01:43:31.292
That's why she broke up with me
in the first place,

2074
01:43:31.376 --> 01:43:33.586
'cause she just thought
that I wouldn't be a good father

2075
01:43:33.670 --> 01:43:36.005
in light of the fact that
I'd be cheating on her all the time.

2076
01:43:36.089 --> 01:43:37.590
But she got over all that.
It's cool now.

2077
01:43:37.674 --> 01:43:39.884
Congratulations, man. That is great.

2078
01:43:40.218 --> 01:43:41.678
We having a party tonight, Andy,

2079
01:43:41.761 --> 01:43:43.221
and I really want you
to be there, man.

2080
01:43:43.304 --> 01:43:45.807
We celebrating and I
really, really want you to be there.

2081
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:48.393
It looks like the Doppler radar.

2082
01:43:48.476 --> 01:43:49.519
Can you believe that?

2083
01:43:49.602 --> 01:43:51.229
This child
ain't even four months old.

2084
01:43:51.312 --> 01:43:53.565
He ain't four months old yet.
Look at what he's packing.

2085
01:43:53.648 --> 01:43:56.151
Everybody dick looks big
on 60-inch TV.

2086
01:43:56.234 --> 01:43:58.820
My sister's dick looks big
on TV, okay?

2087
01:43:59.779 --> 01:44:02.449
Oh, my God,
this guy, Eric Gilliland,

2088
01:44:02.907 --> 01:44:05.493
-he has bought, like, 15 of these.
-Really?

2089
01:44:05.577 --> 01:44:08.538
Yeah, I think he likes
action figures even more than you.

2090
01:44:08.621 --> 01:44:11.166
-That is impossible.
- I think so.

2091
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.295
Andy, the way these things
are flying off your shelf,

2092
01:44:15.378 --> 01:44:18.339
you know, I think you
could actually make like

2093
01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.425
maybe like $100,000.

2094
01:44:20.508 --> 01:44:22.635
-Really?
-Yeah, you could open your store.

2095
01:44:22.719 --> 01:44:24.137
-Wow.
-Honey,

2096
01:44:24.262 --> 01:44:26.431
-That's a lot of money.
- I know.

2097
01:44:26.514 --> 01:44:29.142
That's incredible.
I wouldn't have done it without you.

2098
01:44:29.225 --> 01:44:30.435
Thanks.

2099
01:44:31.102 --> 01:44:33.897
-And that's not the only good news.
-What?

2100
01:44:34.355 --> 01:44:37.317
-You know what tonight is?
-<i>Survivor</i> is on?

2101
01:44:38.610 --> 01:44:40.153
-No.
-I know.

2102
01:44:40.737 --> 01:44:43.323
Is it <i>The Apprentice</i>?

2103
01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.283
No.

2104
01:44:46.034 --> 01:44:47.118
What?

2105
01:44:49.829 --> 01:44:54.167
It's our 20th date.

2106
01:45:00.715 --> 01:45:02.133
-Wow.
-Yeah.

2107
01:45:02.217 --> 01:45:03.259
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

2108
01:45:03.593 --> 01:45:07.013
Seriously? I think we're at 18.

2109
01:45:07.096 --> 01:45:08.681
"Cause there were
a couple of dates there

2110
01:45:08.765 --> 01:45:10.642
-that don't really count as dates.
-No.

2111
01:45:10.725 --> 01:45:13.394
I'll give you a free pass
on those other ones.

2112
01:45:14.395 --> 01:45:15.563
Thank you.

2113
01:45:15.647 --> 01:45:16.773
-Listen.
-What?

2114
01:45:16.856 --> 01:45:18.066
-Listen.
-Mmm-hmm.

2115
01:45:19.567 --> 01:45:21.236
I really like you.

2116
01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.993
I think I'm falling for you.

2117
01:45:29.828 --> 01:45:33.581
I don't know.
I kind of see this going somewhere.

2118
01:45:33.915 --> 01:45:35.124
I do too.

2119
01:45:35.250 --> 01:45:38.419
I just think we should just go crazy
on each other.

2120
01:45:39.671 --> 01:45:41.673
-Okay.
-Okay?

2121
01:45:42.549 --> 01:45:43.800
Oh, thank God!

2122
01:45:48.388 --> 01:45:50.849
Okay, I should...
I gotta pick those up.

2123
01:45:50.932 --> 01:45:51.891
Don't pick them up now.

2124
01:45:51.975 --> 01:45:53.309
No, I have to pick those up
right now.

2125
01:45:53.393 --> 01:45:55.478
-Wait, we'll get them later.
-Listen, no, I can't, no.

2126
01:45:55.562 --> 01:45:57.188
Listen, it's really important
because

2127
01:45:57.272 --> 01:45:59.524
once the integrity of the box
gets compromised...

2128
01:45:59.607 --> 01:46:01.860
This is original packaging
and that's why these things

2129
01:46:01.943 --> 01:46:04.112
are so valuable.
So you don't screw with that.

2130
01:46:04.195 --> 01:46:06.197
-You really don't screw with that.
-All right.

2131
01:46:06.281 --> 01:46:08.324
We can wrap them again later,
you know.

2132
01:46:08.408 --> 01:46:09.742
Yeah, I know. But you know what,

2133
01:46:09.826 --> 01:46:12.036
this is very important
that we don't lose the value

2134
01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.371
and compromise the integrity of it.

2135
01:46:13.454 --> 01:46:15.665
Andy, I'm throwing myself
at you and

2136
01:46:15.748 --> 01:46:17.750
all you can think about
is a fucking toy.

2137
01:46:17.834 --> 01:46:20.920
They're not fucking toys!
This is Iron Man, okay?

2138
01:46:21.004 --> 01:46:23.464
I got this
when I was in second grade.

2139
01:46:23.631 --> 01:46:26.342
Do you know how hard it is
for a kid to not open that?

2140
01:46:26.426 --> 01:46:27.635
This is important.

2141
01:46:27.719 --> 01:46:29.012
These are my things

2142
01:46:29.095 --> 01:46:32.390
and you are trying to make me
sell them and I don't want to.

2143
01:46:32.473 --> 01:46:33.766
-No.
-And you're making me.

2144
01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:35.977
-I'm not making...
-You are encouraging me

2145
01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:38.187
-to quit my job.
-I'm not! I'm not trying to...

2146
01:46:38.271 --> 01:46:40.982
You want me to open a store.
You want me to sell everything.

2147
01:46:41.065 --> 01:46:42.817
You know what,
I'm gonna tell you something.

2148
01:46:42.901 --> 01:46:46.029
I don't just change like that.
I can't just change for you.

2149
01:46:46.112 --> 01:46:49.073
I don't... I'm not trying
to change you. I like you.

2150
01:46:49.157 --> 01:46:51.200
I'm just... I'm trying
to help you grow up, Andy.

2151
01:46:51.284 --> 01:46:52.911
Well, thanks a lot.

2152
01:46:52.994 --> 01:46:57.040
I mean, my God, you ride a bicycle
to work in a stockroom.

2153
01:46:57.123 --> 01:46:59.417
You know what,
I'm not in the stockroom anymore.

2154
01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.002
-I'm a floor manager.
-Okay.

2155
01:47:01.085 --> 01:47:04.088
And I ride a bike because I like to.
Einstein rode a bike.

2156
01:47:04.172 --> 01:47:06.883
He had a wife who he fucked,
by the way.

2157
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:09.844
What do I have to do
for you to have sex with me?

2158
01:47:09.928 --> 01:47:12.430
Do you want me to dress up
like Thor? I'll dress up like Thor.

2159
01:47:12.513 --> 01:47:14.098
I'll dress up like Iron Man.

2160
01:47:14.182 --> 01:47:15.892
What do they do? I'll do it.

2161
01:47:15.975 --> 01:47:17.810
What? Everything's always about sex.

2162
01:47:17.894 --> 01:47:19.479
Why don't you want
to have sex with me?

2163
01:47:19.562 --> 01:47:22.023
Why not? Tell me.
You tell me the truth.

2164
01:47:22.106 --> 01:47:24.275
Is it because I have a kid
who has a kid? Is that why?

2165
01:47:24.359 --> 01:47:25.902
No, it's cool that
you're a grandmother.

2166
01:47:25.985 --> 01:47:27.612
I love the fact
that you're a grandmother.

2167
01:47:27.695 --> 01:47:30.239
-Oh, God!
-You are. You're a hot grandma.

2168
01:47:30.323 --> 01:47:31.449
Oh, my God!

2169
01:47:31.532 --> 01:47:33.618
You are so mean! Get out!

2170
01:47:33.701 --> 01:47:36.454
-Okay, fine. Good!
-Good, fine. You're gonna go.

2171
01:47:36.537 --> 01:47:39.874
- I didn't ask for any of this.
-You asked for all of it, Andy.

2172
01:47:40.291 --> 01:47:41.709
Okay. Great.

2173
01:47:44.754 --> 01:47:45.755
Okay.

2174
01:47:46.130 --> 01:47:47.715
That's the way you want it,

2175
01:47:47.799 --> 01:47:50.718
that's the way
homie's gonna play it.

2176
01:47:51.844 --> 01:47:53.513
Yeah. Truth be told.

2177
01:48:10.947 --> 01:48:13.116
Baby, you better
enjoy yourself tonight

2178
01:48:13.199 --> 01:48:15.493
'cause once this baby's born,
you ain't going out again

2179
01:48:15.576 --> 01:48:16.619
till that baby is in college.

2180
01:48:16.703 --> 01:48:17.912
-Me?
-Yeah.

2181
01:48:17.996 --> 01:48:20.331
You the club rat.
I'm not the one that be going out.

2182
01:48:20.415 --> 01:48:22.166
I'm not a club rat.

2183
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:25.003
You're gonna get up,
you march over there

2184
01:48:25.086 --> 01:48:27.588
and I want you
to hit on Bernadette now.

2185
01:48:27.839 --> 01:48:29.841
Dude, I'm not gonna hit
on Bernadette.

2186
01:48:29.924 --> 01:48:31.050
Yes, you are, man,

2187
01:48:31.134 --> 01:48:33.720
'cause your depression
is boring me for one thing

2188
01:48:33.803 --> 01:48:35.763
and it's actually making me
a little depressed,

2189
01:48:35.847 --> 01:48:37.807
which is then in turn making me
more depressed

2190
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:39.642
that you're actually
affecting my mood.

2191
01:48:39.726 --> 01:48:43.062
Look, I'm not in any kind of place
to talk to a woman, all right?

2192
01:48:43.146 --> 01:48:45.314
I'm just... I'm fragile.

2193
01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.316
I hired her for you.

2194
01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:50.987
I hired a 90-pound girl to work
in the stockroom at Smart Tech

2195
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:52.613
for you, okay?

2196
01:48:52.697 --> 01:48:54.198
I should have hired
a 300-pound guy

2197
01:48:54.282 --> 01:48:55.867
who could lift
a 60-inch flat screen.

2198
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:58.453
But instead I hired a hot girl

2199
01:48:58.536 --> 01:49:01.914
who can't lift an iPod
to bring you out of your funk.

2200
01:49:02.707 --> 01:49:04.208
-You hired her for me?
-Yes.

2201
01:49:04.292 --> 01:49:05.710
So will you go talk to her?

2202
01:49:05.793 --> 01:49:07.628
Yeah, I'm meeting somebody.

2203
01:49:07.795 --> 01:49:08.796
No.

2204
01:49:12.425 --> 01:49:14.552
-Did you just flick me in the nuts?
-No.

2205
01:49:14.635 --> 01:49:17.889
Flicked you in the fleshy patch
where your nuts used to be.

2206
01:49:19.057 --> 01:49:20.600
Quit flicking my balls, man.

2207
01:49:20.683 --> 01:49:23.227
Okay, I'll stop flicking your balls.

2208
01:49:23.311 --> 01:49:25.730
But I'll start punching your nuts.

2209
01:49:28.316 --> 01:49:29.484
Okay.

2210
01:49:33.196 --> 01:49:34.655
Well played, sir.

2211
01:49:35.031 --> 01:49:36.199
-Okay.
-Thank you.

2212
01:49:36.282 --> 01:49:38.409
No problem, man. Go get them.

2213
01:49:38.993 --> 01:49:40.745
Mooj, you done see my son,

2214
01:49:40.828 --> 01:49:42.455
you know his foot gonna be
bigger than this.

2215
01:49:42.538 --> 01:49:45.750
If that baby looks Pakistani,
don't fucking look at me, okay?

2216
01:49:45.833 --> 01:49:49.420
I wouldn't mind. You got good genes.
How old are you? What, 1387

2217
01:49:49.504 --> 01:49:52.423
When your son is born,
is he already in parole?

2218
01:50:00.848 --> 01:50:04.227
I need some poon.

2219
01:50:04.477 --> 01:50:07.480
You guys were so right,
right from the beginning.

2220
01:50:07.772 --> 01:50:12.443
I need genital to genital connection
and that's all I need.

2221
01:50:12.902 --> 01:50:16.447
You know, the thing about
relationships is that they

2222
01:50:16.656 --> 01:50:18.366
make one person go...

2223
01:50:19.951 --> 01:50:22.161
And the other person go,
"What are you talking about?"

2224
01:50:22.245 --> 01:50:23.538
And then one person goes...

2225
01:50:25.081 --> 01:50:26.707
How much have you had to drink, man?

2226
01:50:26.791 --> 01:50:30.294
How much have I had to drink?
How many pots have you smoken?

2227
01:50:30.378 --> 01:50:31.504
What are you talking about?

2228
01:50:31.587 --> 01:50:34.841
How many times have you gone
to the bathroom in your life?

2229
01:50:34.924 --> 01:50:36.134
Let me ask you that.

2230
01:50:36.217 --> 01:50:39.178
You know what, you don't have
an answer for that, do you?

2231
01:50:39.262 --> 01:50:40.847
Fuck you, man! I'm sorry.

2232
01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:44.142
No, you're such a good guy,
and I appreciate you.

2233
01:50:44.225 --> 01:50:46.144
What's up, baby, I didn't know
you had came already.

2234
01:50:46.227 --> 01:50:48.396
Hey, motherfucker!

2235
01:50:50.815 --> 01:50:52.900
Man, you know what,
tonight is the night.

2236
01:50:52.984 --> 01:50:57.697
You know what, you were
totally right and I was wrong.

2237
01:50:57.947 --> 01:51:02.451
You were right all along.
You cannot have a relationship

2238
01:51:02.577 --> 01:51:04.745
with somebody until

2239
01:51:05.413 --> 01:51:07.832
you have sex and that's the long,

2240
01:51:07.915 --> 01:51:09.667
that's the long and short of it.

2241
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:13.212
-So, thank you.
-That's good.

2242
01:51:13.546 --> 01:51:16.549
And now I have to go hunt
for some hos.

2243
01:51:19.427 --> 01:51:22.722
-He going to be all right?
-No, I don't think he is.

2244
01:51:22.972 --> 01:51:25.099
-Cal's a good guy.
-Yeah, he's a great guy.

2245
01:51:25.183 --> 01:51:26.851
It's so funny, because, you know,

2246
01:51:26.934 --> 01:51:29.729
when I first met him and I thought
you were cute at the store

2247
01:51:29.812 --> 01:51:33.149
-he told me you were gay.
-I'm not gay.

2248
01:51:33.357 --> 01:51:35.735
Cal says that I'm gay
because he has a real problem

2249
01:51:35.818 --> 01:51:37.653
with his own gayness.

2250
01:51:38.404 --> 01:51:41.616
But seriously, I'm going
to lay it out for you, right now.

2251
01:51:42.450 --> 01:51:44.660
I was a little reticent
to come over and talk to you.

2252
01:51:44.744 --> 01:51:47.622
You're very pretty and you seem
very nice. The truth is

2253
01:51:47.705 --> 01:51:51.626
I dated this woman, let me
rephrase that, I dated this whore

2254
01:51:51.876 --> 01:51:53.544
who stomped all over my heart.

2255
01:51:53.628 --> 01:51:56.214
And it's just taking me
a little while to kind of,

2256
01:51:56.297 --> 01:51:58.132
you know, get back in the game.

2257
01:51:58.216 --> 01:51:59.675
Oh, my God. Say no more.

2258
01:51:59.759 --> 01:52:02.386
My last boyfriend Sal junior,
IS a scum bag.

2259
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:04.388
I would totally pay people
to have him killed.

2260
01:52:04.472 --> 01:52:06.390
That's how much I fucking hate
that damn scum bag.

2261
01:52:06.474 --> 01:52:08.476
-God, you're fucking awesome.
-You too.

2262
01:52:10.978 --> 01:52:12.897
Hey, you!

2263
01:52:14.982 --> 01:52:16.692
-Hey.
-Hey.

2264
01:52:16.984 --> 01:52:18.486
How you doing?

2265
01:52:18.945 --> 01:52:21.489
Much better,
now that I'm talking to you.

2266
01:52:21.739 --> 01:52:24.325
Hey, lookie,
I can see through your shirt.

2267
01:52:25.117 --> 01:52:26.369
Nice.

2268
01:52:27.578 --> 01:52:30.289
So, you think we should

2269
01:52:30.581 --> 01:52:33.167
take this party to my apartment
or what?

2270
01:52:33.668 --> 01:52:36.712
I am RSVPing "yes."

2271
01:52:40.424 --> 01:52:43.719
Hope you have a big trunk
because I'm putting my bike in it.

2272
01:52:46.472 --> 01:52:47.974
Yeah, let's go!

2273
01:52:53.104 --> 01:52:55.690
Mom, I left my phone
somewhere and I...

2274
01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.566
Thank you.

2275
01:52:58.901 --> 01:53:02.154
What's the matter? Where is Andy?

2276
01:53:02.238 --> 01:53:05.199
-We had a big fight, just...
-Oh, Mom.

2277
01:53:05.741 --> 01:53:07.785
He just stormed out of here.

2278
01:53:07.868 --> 01:53:08.953
What happened?

2279
01:53:09.036 --> 01:53:11.706
Well, I just... Wait a minute,
I thought you hated him.

2280
01:53:11.789 --> 01:53:15.334
I don't hate him.
I mean, he does do magic, but,

2281
01:53:15.418 --> 01:53:17.795
you know, he's a big dork

2282
01:53:18.212 --> 01:53:20.506
and I like seeing you happy.

2283
01:53:22.216 --> 01:53:23.384
I do.

2284
01:53:25.303 --> 01:53:27.805
-That's sweet, that's really sweet.
-Mom.

2285
01:53:28.472 --> 01:53:31.434
Why don't you just go talk to him,
work it out.

2286
01:53:31.517 --> 01:53:34.228
"Cause if the thing is
that important, you can't just stop.

2287
01:53:35.062 --> 01:53:37.148
-Let me dance for you.
-I would love it.

2288
01:53:38.357 --> 01:53:42.570
Look at your bra and your breasts
and everything. That's so great.

2289
01:53:43.362 --> 01:53:46.991
Wow! You know what?
You're so hot. You're so hot.

2290
01:53:47.074 --> 01:53:48.784
I'm smoking hot.

2291
01:53:48.868 --> 01:53:51.787
You know what? I'm just going
to have sex with you.

2292
01:53:51.871 --> 01:53:53.831
Yes! Let's have sex.

2293
01:53:53.914 --> 01:53:56.042
-It's going to happen.
-That's why we are here.

2294
01:53:56.125 --> 01:53:58.586
That's totally what's going
to happen.

2295
01:53:58.836 --> 01:54:00.880
We could do it in the...

2296
01:54:01.881 --> 01:54:03.716
Butt, if you want to.

2297
01:54:05.343 --> 01:54:06.969
But, if I want to what?

2298
01:54:07.762 --> 01:54:10.848
-Butt.
-But what? What?

2299
01:54:10.931 --> 01:54:13.100
-Do it.
-Do it?

2300
01:54:13.434 --> 01:54:14.518
What?

2301
01:54:14.602 --> 01:54:17.355
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2302
01:54:17.438 --> 01:54:19.690
-Butt.
-But...

2303
01:54:19.774 --> 01:54:21.150
-What?
-What?

2304
01:54:24.236 --> 01:54:26.447
But, it still feels so right.

2305
01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:40.544
Yeah!

2306
01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:46.717
Yeah. Right! Okay. Yeah.

2307
01:54:48.135 --> 01:54:49.845
That was a fun day.

2308
01:54:51.389 --> 01:54:54.475
You are so kinky.

2309
01:54:55.184 --> 01:54:56.936
Yeah, I'm so kinky.

2310
01:54:57.478 --> 01:55:00.689
That's why I did this
because I thought it looks...

2311
01:55:00.773 --> 01:55:03.192
You like to shave, don't you?

2312
01:55:03.275 --> 01:55:06.112
-Let's shave each other.
- I don't think you have any hair.

2313
01:55:06.195 --> 01:55:08.030
You know where to shave me.

2314
01:55:08.114 --> 01:55:10.157
-Yeah.
-Because I want to shave you.

2315
01:55:10.241 --> 01:55:11.951
I want to shave your head.

2316
01:55:13.244 --> 01:55:15.121
I wanna give you a buzz cut.

2317
01:55:16.038 --> 01:55:17.748
Let's get in the bath.

2318
01:55:18.124 --> 01:55:19.583
In the bath?

2319
01:55:19.667 --> 01:55:24.046
Yes. We're gonna get dirty.
Dirty, dirty. Sudsy.

2320
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:26.173
It's just about time
I got really dirty.

2321
01:55:26.257 --> 01:55:27.341
Yeah.

2322
01:55:30.302 --> 01:55:34.765
Hey. Hi, it's me,
and I'm on my way to your house.

2323
01:55:34.974 --> 01:55:37.143
<i>I want to do whatever
you want to do, okay?</i>

2324
01:55:37.518 --> 01:55:41.689
<i>Fifty dates. 100.
I hope not, but whatever.</i>

2325
01:55:42.189 --> 01:55:44.817
I'm gonna see you soon, okay? Bye.

2326
01:55:48.863 --> 01:55:52.032
Wow. Okay, well, that was fast.
Okay.

2327
01:55:54.201 --> 01:55:57.163
Wow! Holy shit!

2328
01:55:57.371 --> 01:55:59.957
Wow. This is just the right thing
to happen.

2329
01:56:00.416 --> 01:56:03.794
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Wow!
Almost got my penis.

2330
01:56:04.003 --> 01:56:05.421
Come to mama.

2331
01:56:07.006 --> 01:56:09.800
I'm gonna really take care
of you tonight.

2332
01:56:10.050 --> 01:56:12.553
You're never gonna forget Beth.

2333
01:56:22.730 --> 01:56:24.732
I just want to please you.

2334
01:56:25.566 --> 01:56:27.193
What do you like?

2335
01:56:28.027 --> 01:56:31.113
I don't know. What do you like?

2336
01:56:31.655 --> 01:56:33.741
Can I show you what I like?

2337
01:56:34.241 --> 01:56:35.367
Okay.

2338
01:56:49.006 --> 01:56:51.800
It's so hot in here.

2339
01:56:52.551 --> 01:56:54.929
I wanna introduce you to my friend.

2340
01:56:58.933 --> 01:57:01.018
Your friend is so shiny.

2341
01:57:01.977 --> 01:57:05.022
This guy knows exactly what I like.

2342
01:57:10.402 --> 01:57:12.112
Where's your friend going?

2343
01:57:13.948 --> 01:57:16.617
This is how I'm gonna
warm up for you.

2344
01:57:17.826 --> 01:57:21.664
That's always good to warm up.
You don't wanna pull something.

2345
01:57:39.598 --> 01:57:41.892
Wow, this is graphic.

2346
01:57:55.823 --> 01:57:57.283
I can't do it.

2347
01:57:58.909 --> 01:58:01.662
God, what are you doing here?

2348
01:58:01.829 --> 01:58:04.415
We came here because we were
concerned about you and Trish

2349
01:58:04.498 --> 01:58:06.667
and now I could not give a fuck.

2350
01:58:06.917 --> 01:58:08.836
How did you even know
where she lives?

2351
01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:12.006
- I hit it like eight months back.
-What?

2352
01:58:12.089 --> 01:58:14.758
Never gave her back the key, man.
You have no idea

2353
01:58:14.842 --> 01:58:16.802
where this is going, all right?
That girl is a freak.

2354
01:58:16.885 --> 01:58:20.347
Ohh, it's happening!
It's happening! Andy!

2355
01:58:20.514 --> 01:58:21.849
You think?

2356
01:58:22.016 --> 01:58:24.268
We've been talking, and look,

2357
01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.854
if you love Trish,
you can't do this.

2358
01:58:26.937 --> 01:58:29.940
Look, you guys,
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

2359
01:58:30.024 --> 01:58:32.610
I don't even know who I am.
All I know is

2360
01:58:32.693 --> 01:58:36.280
that woman
scares the shit out of me

2361
01:58:36.363 --> 01:58:38.616
and I just wanna go home, okay?

2362
01:58:38.824 --> 01:58:41.118
-Let's go.
-We should all get out of here.

2363
01:58:41.201 --> 01:58:42.911
-Okay.
-We should all go.

2364
01:58:42.995 --> 01:58:46.332
-It wasn't that good for me.
-We should totally get out of here.

2365
01:58:46.415 --> 01:58:48.626
We should run away from here.

2366
01:58:55.215 --> 01:58:56.258
Hey.

2367
01:58:57.635 --> 01:58:58.719
Cal.

2368
01:59:01.472 --> 01:59:03.182
Go around!

2369
01:59:04.058 --> 01:59:06.185
Come on, just go around me!

2370
01:59:09.396 --> 01:59:11.065
Can't you hear me?

2371
01:59:18.572 --> 01:59:21.617
Hey, there. Hi, Trish.

2372
01:59:23.243 --> 01:59:25.746
Man, I'm really sorry about tonight.

2373
01:59:25.829 --> 01:59:27.247
What's this?

2374
01:59:28.290 --> 01:59:29.958
Those are David's.

2375
01:59:32.044 --> 01:59:33.837
I think he has a problem.

2376
01:59:33.921 --> 01:59:36.423
-These are David's?
-He's into that.

2377
01:59:36.590 --> 01:59:40.010
David's <i>Boner Jams '03</i>?

2378
01:59:40.636 --> 01:59:42.680
Yeah, it's so sad.

2379
01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:46.183
He compiled all the best
boner scenes, I guess.

2380
01:59:47.101 --> 01:59:49.436
This isn't what it looks like, okay?

2381
01:59:49.937 --> 01:59:53.023
-What does this look like?
-A vagina.

2382
01:59:54.066 --> 01:59:55.609
And what do you do with this vagina?

2383
01:59:55.693 --> 01:59:58.946
To learn.
It's for medicinal purposes.

2384
01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:02.324
-Hey, I'm sorry. God...
-What's this?

2385
02:00:02.825 --> 02:00:05.786
This your date drug? Your roofie?

2386
02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:07.621
It's a Mentos.

2387
02:00:08.372 --> 02:00:10.290
They're "The Freshmaker."

2388
02:00:10.374 --> 02:00:11.792
Yeah, right.

2389
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:13.961
What are you,
some kind of sex pervert?

2390
02:00:14.044 --> 02:00:15.379
Are you a deviant or something?

2391
02:00:15.462 --> 02:00:18.173
-No, I'm not a sexual deviant!
-What is all this?

2392
02:00:18.257 --> 02:00:20.718
I haven't even tried
to have sex with you, so...

2393
02:00:20.801 --> 02:00:23.679
What are you trying to do?
What are you buttering me up for?

2394
02:00:23.762 --> 02:00:24.888
Come on.

2395
02:00:24.972 --> 02:00:26.724
You're not gonna try and kill me,
are you?

2396
02:00:26.807 --> 02:00:29.476
-Look, Trish.
-You didn't get a new carpet.

2397
02:00:29.727 --> 02:00:33.021
I'm not trying to kill you.
I love you.

2398
02:00:33.439 --> 02:00:35.858
-I love you.
-Oh, God!

2399
02:00:36.150 --> 02:00:37.317
Trish.

2400
02:00:45.868 --> 02:00:48.078
Trish. No!

2401
02:00:48.996 --> 02:00:51.498
No. Trish, stop.

2402
02:00:56.044 --> 02:00:57.337
Come on, Trish!

2403
02:01:00.758 --> 02:01:02.676
I need to talk to you!

2404
02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:03.844
No!

2405
02:01:06.013 --> 02:01:07.014
Damn it.

2406
02:01:38.837 --> 02:01:40.214
Oh, my God!

2407
02:01:43.008 --> 02:01:46.053
Andy! Oh, my God!

2408
02:01:46.136 --> 02:01:47.513
Call 911.

2409
02:01:47.679 --> 02:01:49.598
Oh, my... Andy.

2410
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:52.100
Oh, my God!

2411
02:01:52.184 --> 02:01:54.978
I'm gonna need a minute.
I'm in a lot of pain right now.

2412
02:01:55.062 --> 02:01:56.730
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

2413
02:01:56.814 --> 02:01:57.981
Not bad.

2414
02:01:58.065 --> 02:02:00.400
There were two sides
to that billboard.

2415
02:02:00.484 --> 02:02:02.402
And they both hurt equally.

2416
02:02:02.778 --> 02:02:05.405
Andy.

2417
02:02:07.574 --> 02:02:09.743
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

2418
02:02:10.035 --> 02:02:11.703
No, I'm not okay.

2419
02:02:12.996 --> 02:02:14.414
I'm a virgin.

2420
02:02:16.583 --> 02:02:17.751
A what?

2421
02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:21.046
I'm a virgin. I always have been.

2422
02:02:22.422 --> 02:02:25.759
Andy, is that what
all this was about?

2423
02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:28.053
I'm sorry.

2424
02:02:28.136 --> 02:02:30.514
You're just a virgin, that's all?

2425
02:02:30.639 --> 02:02:33.308
-Yeah.
-That's good. That's a good thing.

2426
02:02:35.102 --> 02:02:36.937
I feel stupid.

2427
02:02:38.605 --> 02:02:41.316
It's okay. I thought
you were trying to kill me.

2428
02:02:43.068 --> 02:02:44.111
No.

2429
02:02:44.945 --> 02:02:46.238
Oh, my God.

2430
02:02:47.322 --> 02:02:49.908
No, I'm not trying to kill you.

2431
02:02:53.787 --> 02:02:56.456
That's why I never tried
to have sex with you.

2432
02:02:56.832 --> 02:02:59.293
I was scared, okay? I just...

2433
02:03:00.294 --> 02:03:01.837
"Cause I didn't know
what I was doing.

2434
02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:03.755
I just didn't think
it would be good.

2435
02:03:03.839 --> 02:03:06.800
Of course it'll be good.
We love each other.

2436
02:03:08.427 --> 02:03:09.595
Really?

2437
02:03:11.263 --> 02:03:12.639
I love you.

2438
02:03:14.141 --> 02:03:15.267
Yeah.

2439
02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:22.482
Get the fuck out of the road,
virgin!

2440
02:03:24.318 --> 02:03:25.777
Shut up, you fucking jerk!

2441
02:03:25.861 --> 02:03:28.780
No, that's okay.
That's all right. Sorry.

2442
02:03:30.407 --> 02:03:31.491
You know what,

2443
02:03:31.575 --> 02:03:34.369
for so long I thought that there was
something wrong with me

2444
02:03:34.453 --> 02:03:37.289
because it had never happened, but

2445
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:43.545
I realize now that it was just
because I was waiting for you.

2446
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:11.323
This was some wedding.
How could they afford it?

2447
02:04:11.406 --> 02:04:14.701
Dude sells his toys and makes
like a half a million dollars.

2448
02:04:14.826 --> 02:04:16.995
-It's crazy, right?
-That's fucking crazy.

2449
02:04:17.079 --> 02:04:19.039
We're gonna get some fucking toys.

2450
02:04:19.122 --> 02:04:21.291
We are all so happy for you.

2451
02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:24.294
I am delighted to say these words.

2452
02:04:25.212 --> 02:04:26.338
Andy,

2453
02:04:26.922 --> 02:04:28.799
you may Kiss the bride.

2454
02:04:42.062 --> 02:04:45.190
And for God's sake,
consummate the thing.

2455
02:04:50.153 --> 02:04:53.073
No! Stop it. I have the key.

2456
02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:02.207
I'm not gonna be done
buffing the marble

2457
02:05:02.290 --> 02:05:04.001
for about a half an hour, but

2458
02:05:04.084 --> 02:05:06.586
you can come in and sit down
if you want

2459
02:05:06.670 --> 02:05:08.839
or wait in the lobby. It's okay.

2460
02:05:08.922 --> 02:05:10.465
It's up to you.

2461
02:05:17.639 --> 02:05:19.933
Dude, get the fuck out of here.

2462
02:05:30.944 --> 02:05:32.446
-Ready?
-Yeah.

2463
02:05:38.618 --> 02:05:39.995
-Yes.
-Yeah.

2464
02:05:46.668 --> 02:05:47.669
Whoa.

2465
02:05:48.211 --> 02:05:50.505
You're officially not a virgin.

2466
02:05:51.298 --> 02:05:52.424
Cool.

2467
02:06:00.474 --> 02:06:01.850
Wow.

2468
02:06:09.316 --> 02:06:10.942
Wanna do it again?

2469
02:06:12.027 --> 02:06:13.862
-Yeah.
-Good. Okay.

2470
02:06:13.945 --> 02:06:15.155
Sure.

2471
02:06:15.489 --> 02:06:17.657
That was good. That was okay.

2472
02:06:21.036 --> 02:06:22.120
Okay.

2473
02:06:22.245 --> 02:06:23.288
-You ready?
-Yeah.

2474
02:06:23.371 --> 02:06:25.999
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, I'm fine, yeah.

2475
02:06:38.762 --> 02:06:40.764
So, how was that for you?

2476
02:06:45.644 --> 02:06:48.146
