Thank you. Thank you very much.

Big night tonight?

- Yeah.
- Yeah?

15
00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:19.602
Yeah, actually. Actually, the biggest.

- Yeah.

00:01:43.922 --> 00:01:46.521
Well, girl I've ever met.

26
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:50.880
Okay. Well, if you have any questions,
my name is Claire.

27
00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.720
Okay. Actually, yeah.
Does this come in red?

28
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:58.919
- I can check.
- Also, Claire, does it come any larger?

29
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.199
Much, much larger.

30
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.839
Oh, no.

31
00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.038
Hey. Is she in there?

32
00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.038
- Yeah, she's in there.
- Good. How do I look?

33
00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.598
I see your balls.

34
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.997
Are you crazy?
Come here. Come here. Up here, up.

35
00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.117
- What's the matter with you?
- What?

36
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.637
- This? This is the big idea?
- Yeah. Yeah. She's gonna love it.

37
00:02:37.798 --> 00:02:38.877
- She's gonna hate it.
- She's gonna love it.

38
00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.397
- No, she's gonna hate it.
- Love it.

39
00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:42.396
No, she's gonna hate it more
than I hate it, and I really hate it.

40
00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:44.756
You know what your problem is, Ted?
You just...

41
00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:47.997
- You don't understand true love.
- Oh, and you do?

42
00:02:48.157 --> 00:02:50.716
I understand that there's a girl
that I love waiting for me in there.

43
00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:53.396
And you know what? She loves me, too.

44
00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:55.956
I still see balls.

45
00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:07.675
Can I get you a drink
while you wait for your friend?

46
00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:14.595
Hopefully, in a man's life,
you do this one time.

47
00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:17.634
Well, I want my one time
to be unforgettable.

and me will be telling our grandkids.

- (SIGHING) Thanks, buddy.

- What's up, ladies?
- Oh, goodness.

you some C rations on the house.

00:12:22.756 --> 00:12:27.155
So I need you all to pay attention.
Especially you, mon amour.

172
00:12:27.316 --> 00:12:29.355
(FRENCH ACCENT)
Give me the little hand.

173
00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:32.275
- Isn't he the cutest thing ever?
- Hey, I resent that.

174
00:12:32.436 --> 00:12:34.515
Isn't it getting kind of late, you guys?

175
00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:36.594
Oh, what's the matter, Cinderella?

176
00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:39.674
You're not gonna turn
into a pumpkin, are you?

177
00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:43.993
Do I know how to push her buttons,
or what?

178
00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:45.994
I am pushing your buttons.

179
00:12:46.995 --> 00:12:51.033
Honey, do your charade, okay?
I have to get up early tomorrow.

180
00:12:51.194 --> 00:12:52.553
Aye, aye, Captain. Okay.

181
00:12:53.035 --> 00:12:54.513
Oh, wait. We can't do this...

182
00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:57.033
Incoming.

183
00:12:57.194 --> 00:12:59.753
Here we go. Last one.

184
00:13:00.634 --> 00:13:03.472
(INHALING DEEPLY)

185
00:13:04.633 --> 00:13:06.832
- Four words. First word.
- Four words. First word.

186
00:13:06.993 --> 00:13:08.712
- Me... Me...
- Shazam.

187
00:13:08.873 --> 00:13:11.792
William! William! Shorter. Willie. Will!

188
00:13:11.953 --> 00:13:13.232
- Will.
- Will. Okay.

189
00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:15.271
- Second word. It sounds like...
- Second word. Sounds like...

190
00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:17.552
- Rockette. Boot. Shoe.
- Shoe.

191
00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:18.751
You.

192
00:13:19.952 --> 00:13:21.392
(BLOWING)

193
00:13:22.312 --> 00:13:23.551
Fourth word.

194
00:13:23.712 --> 00:13:25.271
- Me, it's me again... Me?
- Me?

195
00:13:25.432 --> 00:13:26.671
- Oh, it is "Me." Okay.
- Will you blank me?

196
00:13:26.832 --> 00:13:28.430
Hey, buddy, there's ladies present.

197
00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:30.031
All right, well, you know,
that's just tasteless, Stuart,

198
00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:31.151
- for God's sake.
- Sorry.

199
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.670
All right. Will you blank me?
Third word.

200
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:37.471
Saunter.

201
00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:40.990
- Marry?
- Stuart, he's proposing.

202
00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:43.830
Katie, will you marry me?

203
00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:48.430
Yes! Yes! She says yes!

204
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:50.869
- Honey?
- Katie!

205
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.829
Katie!

206
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.429
Honestly, Katherine,

207
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.908
do you have any idea how embarrassing
that was for me last night?

208
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.869
I didn't say no, Mom.
I just said I needed to think about it.

209
00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:03.308
What's there to think about?

210
00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:06.308
That boy is a catch, and he's crazy
about you. God knows why.

211
00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:09.427
Just tell me, what is it you want?
Because William is perfect.

212
00:14:09.589 --> 00:14:11.468
For one thing, he's just about
the most attractive orthodontist

213
00:14:11.628 --> 00:14:13.788
I think I've ever seen.
And he's incredibly romantic.

214
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:17.187
Mom, I know he's perfect.
I just need a little time.

215
00:14:17.349 --> 00:14:19.947
- Will you talk to her, Stuart?
- Not to toot my own horn,

216
00:14:20.108 --> 00:14:21.987
but William reminds me a lot of me
when I was younger.

217
00:14:22.148 --> 00:14:25.307
- Are you listening to your father?
- He is not my father.

218
00:14:25.468 --> 00:14:27.467
This man is more of a father to you
than your father ever was,

219
00:14:27.628 --> 00:14:29.066
God rest his soul.

220
00:14:29.227 --> 00:14:32.187
- Dad is not dead.
- He's dead to me, the son of a bitch.

221
00:14:32.347 --> 00:14:34.346
- Don't talk about Dad that way!
- Don't you raise your voice to me!

222
00:14:34.507 --> 00:14:36.426
- You're getting emotional, Lois.
- I am not getting emotional!

223
00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:39.946
All right. I am leaving
this house in five minutes,

224
00:14:40.107 --> 00:14:43.426
and if you want to be on that bus,
I suggest you pull yourself together.

225
00:14:46.826 --> 00:14:48.785
Sometimes I wonder
if you still love him.

226
00:14:48.946 --> 00:14:49.985
Who?

227
00:14:50.985 --> 00:14:52.904
- Dad.
- Are you crazy?

228
00:14:53.065 --> 00:14:55.384
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well, you must have loved him once.

229
00:14:55.545 --> 00:15:00.104
Honey, I was 18 when I met your father
and about as dumb as a piece of ham.

230
00:15:00.905 --> 00:15:03.744
What did I know about love?
All I knew was...

231
00:15:08.144 --> 00:15:11.463
He was the hottest thing
that I had ever seen.

232
00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:15.943
Oh, he looked like a panther,

233
00:15:16.504 --> 00:15:18.023
a sex panther.

234
00:15:20.304 --> 00:15:22.942
- Sounds like love to me.
- Well, there's a big difference

235
00:15:23.103 --> 00:15:26.542
between love and mindless,
animalistic, carnal lust.

236
00:15:27.704 --> 00:15:29.422
And what do you have with Stuart?

237
00:15:30.423 --> 00:15:33.782
What I have with Stuart
is what I want for you and William.

238
00:15:33.943 --> 00:15:36.742
- A mature, stable relationship.
- But are you happy?

239
00:15:36.903 --> 00:15:39.782
Of course I'm happy. I'm very happy.

240
00:15:39.942 --> 00:15:42.181
Very, very happy.

241
00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.581
No, no. Very happy.

242
00:15:45.662 --> 00:15:46.621
Very happy.

243
00:15:46.782 --> 00:15:49.301
- I gotta go. The bus is here.
- All right.

244
00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:56.860
Very happy.

245
00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:18.419
There she is. There's my beautiful girl!

246
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.978
Hey! Keep it down.

247
00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:25.538
I will eat your head! I will
tear it off, shove it up your ass,

248
00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:28.698
pull it through your mouth,
brush my teeth with it, and then eat it!

249
00:16:28.859 --> 00:16:30.418
- I will eat it.
- Smitty!

250
00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:32.578
I'm not finished. Eat it!

251
00:16:34.499 --> 00:16:36.538
- Dad.
- What?

252
00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:38.817
- Apologize to him.
- Oh, come on.

253
00:16:38.978 --> 00:16:43.897
I'm serious, Dad. It's just rude. Now.

254
00:16:44.738 --> 00:16:46.217
Do it now, Dad.

255
00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.737
Hey, Dave. I'm sorry.

256
00:16:54.497 --> 00:16:55.456
Smitty, I'm working
on my appeal over here.

257
00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:58.296
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

258
00:17:00.176 --> 00:17:03.936
You see, that's why
I love you so much, Baby Bear.

259
00:17:04.097 --> 00:17:05.896
You got your mother's good heart.

260
00:17:08.736 --> 00:17:09.975
What's wrong?

261
00:17:10.136 --> 00:17:13.135
No, nothing.
William asked me to marry him.

262
00:17:13.296 --> 00:17:15.335
But that's good.
That's what you wanted, no?

263
00:17:15.496 --> 00:17:16.614
Yeah.

264
00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:20.334
No.

265
00:17:20.495 --> 00:17:23.134
Oh, Dad, I don't know. I just...

266
00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:28.133
I mean, how are you supposed to know
when you're with the right person?

267
00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:32.853
Just listen to your heart, Baby Bear.

268
00:17:33.014 --> 00:17:34.014
You'll know.

269
00:17:35.774 --> 00:17:38.773
Hey, do you know what I do
when I'm feeling blue?

270
00:17:38.934 --> 00:17:41.533
Yeah. You drink homemade toilet wine.

271
00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:42.653
No!

272
00:17:42.813 --> 00:17:46.652
Well, yeah. But I also write
in my gratitude journal.

273
00:17:46.813 --> 00:17:49.452
And every day, I write about the things
that I have to be grateful for,

274
00:17:49.613 --> 00:17:52.092
like you and your mother.

275
00:17:53.493 --> 00:17:54.692
Oh, here.

276
00:17:55.693 --> 00:17:59.332
"December 25th, Christmas Day."

277
00:17:59.493 --> 00:18:03.251
"I am grateful that somebody finally
stabbed that cocksucker Rodriguez."

278
00:18:03.412 --> 00:18:04.732
Dad.

279
00:18:08.852 --> 00:18:11.251
I'm gonna say yes.

280
00:18:11.412 --> 00:18:12.371
Yes!

281
00:18:12.532 --> 00:18:14.970
I mean, we get along so well, right?

282
00:18:15.132 --> 00:18:18.010
He's so funny.
He cracks me up, you guys.

283
00:18:20.451 --> 00:18:24.610
- I'm gonna say yes.
- That's great. Right, Matador?

284
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.329
I think William is kind of a turd.

285
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.769
- Really?
- Yeah.

286
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:34.209
But he's like a turd
with a piece of candy in it.

287
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.049
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

288
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.769
Marriage isn't in our blood.
We're circus folk.

289
00:18:41.929 --> 00:18:45.888
Gypsies roaming from big top to big top
on the open road.

290
00:18:46.969 --> 00:18:49.008
You guys have been working in the diner
since I've known you.

291
00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:52.368
Not in here, Katie. Not in here.

292
00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:01.847
Gentlemen, observe.

293
00:19:05.048 --> 00:19:09.847
(SCREAMING)

294
00:19:10.008 --> 00:19:12.327
Can I get you guys anything else?

295
00:19:13.327 --> 00:19:15.566
Will you marry me?

296
00:19:15.727 --> 00:19:17.766
- Excuse me?
- Will you marry me?

297
00:19:18.967 --> 00:19:23.526
Seriously. Think about it.
What could possibly be more romantic

298
00:19:23.687 --> 00:19:26.485
than throwing away your entire life
and running off with some handsome,

299
00:19:26.646 --> 00:19:29.925
dark-haired stranger
you spotted across a restaurant?

300
00:19:33.926 --> 00:19:37.125
I'm sorry. He's had a lot of syrup.

301
00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:40.204
- Okay.
- Okay, he's had a lot of syrup?

302
00:19:40.365 --> 00:19:41.804
Okay, I'll marry you.

303
00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:47.924
- What?
- Yes. Yes.

304
00:19:49.325 --> 00:19:50.564
I'll marry you!

305
00:19:51.204 --> 00:19:54.724
Jane! Jane! Will you cover for me?

306
00:19:54.884 --> 00:19:55.843
Where're you going?

307
00:19:56.004 --> 00:19:57.003
(SCREAMING)

308
00:19:57.164 --> 00:20:00.363
I'm getting married! To this guy!

309
00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:03.763
Come on. Come on!

310
00:20:03.923 --> 00:20:06.603
Go. Get out of here. I got the bill.

311
00:20:15.603 --> 00:20:16.562
Oh!

312
00:20:17.642 --> 00:20:18.881
Anderson.

313
00:20:19.042 --> 00:20:20.722
- Katie.
- Katie. Hi.

314
00:20:26.802 --> 00:20:28.121
Two kisses.

315
00:20:29.922 --> 00:20:32.921
Big rig. Watch this.

316
00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:35.600
Stick that arm up your ass!

317
00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:53.280
<i>♪ Got a brand new roof above my head ♪</i>

318
00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.119
<i>♪ All the empty boxes thrown away ♪</i>

319
00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:02.159
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Yeah.

320
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.639
So years from now,
when we're celebrating

321
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.119
our 37th wedding anniversary

322
00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:12.238
and one of our friends
asks us about our first date,

323
00:21:12.399 --> 00:21:15.478
- is this what we'll talk about?
- I guess it is.

324
00:21:15.638 --> 00:21:17.877
Yeah. Okay.

325
00:21:18.038 --> 00:21:20.077
And... And then I'll tell them
the funny part.

326
00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:22.157
What's the funny part?

327
00:21:22.318 --> 00:21:25.357
That after we talked about it,
you stepped in dog shit.

328
00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:30.476
- Oh! I stepped in dog shit!
- Yeah.

329
00:21:30.637 --> 00:21:31.996
Why didn't you warn me?
You could have warned me.

330
00:21:32.157 --> 00:21:33.516
That would have ruined the story.

331
00:21:33.677 --> 00:21:36.596
Ah, man. Can I borrow your...

332
00:21:36.757 --> 00:21:37.916
Oh, God! Cut it out!

333
00:21:38.077 --> 00:21:39.516
ANDERSON: Okay, careful, careful.

334
00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:52.235
- I've never been up here before.
- Yeah, it's a cool place to come

335
00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:56.514
if you want to get an old refrigerator
filled with vomit.

336
00:21:57.036 --> 00:21:58.395
I was looking for one of those.

337
00:21:58.556 --> 00:22:01.234
Yeah? Well, I think
it's two-for-one day, so...

338
00:22:03.915 --> 00:22:05.594
Look what I've got.

339
00:22:07.275 --> 00:22:08.514

(SIGHS)

341
00:22:14.074 --> 00:22:16.113
- This is stupid.
- What?

342
00:22:16.274 --> 00:22:19.993
You know, this. Us sitting up here,
pretending we're doing something.

343
00:22:20.154 --> 00:22:22.513
- It's just stupid.
- It is, right?

344
00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.433
I mean, obviously
we're not getting married.

345
00:22:24.594 --> 00:22:26.073
Obviously.

346
00:22:26.234 --> 00:22:29.953
- Strangers don't get married.
- Well, in some cultures they do.

347
00:22:30.393 --> 00:22:32.112
- They do?
- But not ours.

348
00:22:32.273 --> 00:22:34.792
Not ours.
Other cultures, far-away cultures.

349
00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:37.192
The Kalahari bushmen is one example.

350
00:22:37.353 --> 00:22:39.832
- And my parents did. They did.
- They did?

351
00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:41.271
My mom barely knew my dad,

352
00:22:41.433 --> 00:22:42.911
and she got pregnant with me,
and they eloped

353
00:22:43.072 --> 00:22:45.671
to this weird little place
called The House of Wedded Bliss

354
00:22:45.832 --> 00:22:47.951
- in Atlantic City.
- The House of Wedded Bliss?

355
00:22:48.112 --> 00:22:52.271
Yeah.
Doesn't that sound incredibly romantic?

356
00:22:52.432 --> 00:22:54.670
Sounds like a bad Chinese takeout place.

357
00:22:58.231 --> 00:23:02.150
Yeah, well, I mean, just because they
did, doesn't mean that we are, right?

358
00:23:03.271 --> 00:23:06.710
You probably weren't even serious
when you asked.

359
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.589
- Were you?
- Of course not.

360
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.749
You see, that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, this whole thing is just...

361
00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:17.869
It's stupid.

362
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.629
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

363
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.109
Wait, wait, wait. What's happening?

364
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.468
- I'm just such an idiot.
- Are you crying?

365
00:23:26.629 --> 00:23:28.548
- No.
- Why are you crying?

366
00:23:29.629 --> 00:23:31.267
I am not crying.

367
00:23:33.628 --> 00:23:35.748
It really looks like you're crying.

368
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:37.548
Yeah, well, I'm crying now.

369
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:40.667
Are you satisfied, you asshole?

370
00:23:41.908 --> 00:23:43.547
Hey. Hey, hey.

371
00:23:43.708 --> 00:23:46.067
Hey. Hey, you.

372
00:23:46.907 --> 00:23:49.587
Hey! Hey.

373
00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.706
Are you okay?

374
00:23:58.187 --> 00:24:02.506
I can't remember the last time I did
that. I don't think I've ever done that.

375
00:24:03.307 --> 00:24:07.186
- Do you want a tissue?
- No, I'm fine. I feel incredible.

376
00:24:07.427 --> 00:24:10.625
- Really?
- Why is that?

377
00:24:11.586 --> 00:24:14.825
- You sure you don't want a tissue?
- No, I'm fine.

378
00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:19.745
Anderson, when you asked me
to marry you,

379
00:24:19.906 --> 00:24:23.584
you probably picked the only girl
in the whole world that would say yes.

380
00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:25.944
I don't think that's a coincidence,
do you?

381
00:24:27.105 --> 00:24:28.224
I don't know.

382
00:24:28.385 --> 00:24:30.624
- Do you believe in fate?
- No.

383
00:24:30.784 --> 00:24:35.063
Neither do I.
You see, this was meant to be.

384
00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:37.103
Will you marry me?

385
00:24:37.264 --> 00:24:39.583
- TED: You said yes?
- Yeah. Well, why not?

386
00:24:39.744 --> 00:24:43.822
You know, I think this is exactly what
I need to get my life back on track.

387
00:24:43.984 --> 00:24:45.783
I mean,
why can't two strangers get married?

388
00:24:45.944 --> 00:24:49.342
- I don't know. Because it's retarded?
- Look, you said it yourself.

389
00:24:49.503 --> 00:24:51.582
You said I need to get back out there
and meet people. Right? So...

390
00:24:51.744 --> 00:24:53.502
Yeah, meet! Meet! Not marry!

391
00:24:53.663 --> 00:24:56.342
Why can't you just date her for a while
like a normal human being?

392
00:24:56.503 --> 00:24:58.262
Look, don't worry. Okay? It's not...

393
00:24:58.423 --> 00:25:00.382
You know, it's not like
we're getting married today.

394
00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:02.621
We talked about it,
and we decided to take things slow.

395
00:25:02.782 --> 00:25:05.182
- So what's next?
- She's moving in with me.

396
00:25:05.342 --> 00:25:06.301
I gotta go.

397
00:25:08.182 --> 00:25:10.381

Not to William?

430
00:27:11.253 --> 00:27:13.652
His name's Anderson.
I met him a couple of hours ago.

431
00:27:13.813 --> 00:27:15.292
A couple of hours ago?

432

What kind of name is Anderson?

433

- Use your head here, Katie.
- He's black, isn't he?

I have to go.

Don't you think
you're being a little impulsive?

00:27:25.132 --> 00:27:29.651
Yes! That is exactly what I'm being.
And guess what? It feels great!

- You ready?
- Oh, my God.

438
00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:36.411
- Hi.
- Hey, there, dude.

439
00:27:36.572 --> 00:27:38.010
You must be Anderson.

440
00:27:38.171 --> 00:27:39.130
- No.
- Matador.

This is my friend, Matador.
He's just giving me a ride.

No problem.

00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:50.749
Okay, yeah. You found the bedroom.

508
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:55.508
So, yup. So this... This is the bedroom.
This is the bedroom.

509
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:57.627
I should probably clean up a little.

510
00:32:57.788 --> 00:32:59.228
Good. Good.

511
00:32:59.389 --> 00:33:02.507
So listen, I was thinking about
everything and how great this is,

512
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:04.787
but it's all happening so fast,
and I was afraid

513
00:33:04.948 --> 00:33:06.867
that maybe you thought it
was happening too fast.

514
00:33:07.028 --> 00:33:08.507
That's what makes it so exciting.

515
00:33:08.668 --> 00:33:11.626
Exactly. Exactly.
That's what I was exactly going to say.

516
00:33:11.787 --> 00:33:13.306
Because personally,
I couldn't be more thrilled.

517
00:33:13.468 --> 00:33:14.666
Well, you seem really nervous.

518
00:33:14.827 --> 00:33:17.946
Really? No, no, no. I don't...
That's weird. I don't get nervous.

519
00:33:18.107 --> 00:33:21.786
I just express joy
by sweating on occasion.

520
00:33:21.947 --> 00:33:24.026
- Who's Vanessa?
- Who?

521
00:33:24.187 --> 00:33:26.346
You said "Vanessa"
right before you passed out.

522
00:33:26.507 --> 00:33:28.665
- I did?
- Oh, is this her?

523
00:33:28.826 --> 00:33:32.265
No. No, that's not her.
I don't know who that is.

524
00:33:32.426 --> 00:33:35.025
That's... That picture
came with the frame.

525
00:33:35.226 --> 00:33:37.025
But you're in the picture.

526
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.745
Yeah, there I am, right there. I know.

527
00:33:41.906 --> 00:33:43.784
That's because I used to do
some modeling when I was younger.

528
00:33:43.946 --> 00:33:45.745
- Really?
- Yes, I did.

529
00:33:45.905 --> 00:33:49.704
I did some picture frame modeling
back when that whole "regular guy" phase

530
00:33:49.865 --> 00:33:51.943
was sweeping the picture frame
modeling industry.

531
00:33:52.105 --> 00:33:54.184
- That is so cool.
- Yeah.

535
00:34:11.784 --> 00:34:14.543
No. No, no, no.
It's my mom. I'll call her back.

536
00:34:14.703 --> 00:34:16.982
- Oh, should I say hi?
- That's okay.

537
00:34:17.143 --> 00:34:19.342
No, really, it's weird.
I mean, I should say hi, right?

538
00:34:19.502 --> 00:34:22.261
No, no. That's... I got it. I got it.

there and meet them before we...

get some saline
or eye drops or something.

00:38:05.447 --> 00:38:06.725
No, really.

602
00:38:08.646 --> 00:38:10.526
I'll go get some saline.

- Okay. Slow down. What's the problem?

- Oh, God.

- Oh, buddy.

you know?

Oh, Anderson's

to go downstairs to the basement

all his little toys.

Especially if you like googly eyes.

I do like googly eyes.
