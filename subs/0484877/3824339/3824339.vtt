Well, girl I've ever met.

17
00:01:56.699 --> 00:02:00.035
Okay. Well, if you have any questions,
my name is Claire.

18
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.996
Okay. Actually, yeah.
Does this come in red?

19
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.418
- I can check.
- Also, Claire, does it come any larger?

20
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:17.052
Much, much larger.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.061

- Yeah, she's in there.
- Good. How do I look?

I see your balls.

25

Come here. Come here. Up here, up.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.122
- What's the matter with you?
- What?

27
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.792
- This? This is the big idea?
- Yeah. Yeah. She's gonna love it.

28
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.085
- She's gonna hate it.
- She's gonna love it.

29
00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.670
- No, she's gonna hate it.
- Love it.

30

No, she's gonna hate it more
than I hate it, and I really hate it.

You just...

32
00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:59.595
- You don't understand true love.
- Oh, and you do?

33
00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:02.431
I understand that there's a girl
that I love waiting for me in there.

34
00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.225
And you know what? She loves me, too.

35
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.895
I still see balls.

36
00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.115

while you wait for your friend?

37
00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:27.331
Hopefully, in a man's life,
you do this one time.

38

to be unforgettable.

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.687
Incoming.

174
00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:37.524
Here we go. Last one.

175
00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:41.402
(INHALING DEEPLY)

176
00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.906
- Four words. First word.
- Four words. First word.

177
00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:46.866
- Me... Me...
- Shazam.

178
00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:50.078
William! William! Shorter. Willie. Will!

179
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.579
- Will.
- Will. Okay.

180
00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:53.706
- Second word. It sounds like...
- Second word. Sounds like...

181
00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:56.084
- Rockette. Boot. Shoe.
- Shoe.

182
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.335
You.

183
00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:00.088
(BLOWING)

184
00:14:01.048 --> 00:14:02.340
Fourth word.

185
00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:04.133
- Me, it's me again... Me?
- Me?

186
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:05.593
- Oh, it is "Me." Okay.
- Will you blank me?

187
00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:07.428
Hey, buddy, there's ladies present.

188
00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:09.097
All right, well, you know,
that's just tasteless, Stuart,

189
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.265
- for God's sake.
- Sorry.

190
00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:13.935
All right. Will you blank me?
Third word.

191
00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:16.855
Saunter.

192
00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:20.525
- Marry?
- Stuart, he's proposing.

193
00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.486
Katie, will you marry me?

194
00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.283
Yes! Yes! She says yes!

195
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:30.827
- Honey?
- Katie!

196
00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:34.956
Katie!

197
00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:36.624
Honestly, Katherine,

198
00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:39.210
do you have any idea how embarrassing
that was for me last night?

199
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:42.297
I didn't say no, Mom.
I just said I needed to think about it.

200
00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:43.798
What's there to think about?

201
00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:46.926
That boy is a catch, and he's crazy
about you. God knows why.

202
00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:50.179
Just tell me, what is it you want?
Because William is perfect.

203
00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:52.307
For one thing, he's just about
the most attractive orthodontist

204
00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:54.726
I think I've ever seen.
And he's incredibly romantic.

205
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.271
Mom, I know he's perfect.
I just need a little time.

206
00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:01.149
- Will you talk to her, Stuart?
- Not to toot my own horn,

207
00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.276
but William reminds me a lot of me
when I was younger.

208
00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:06.738
- Are you listening to your father?
- He is not my father.

209
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.990
This man is more of a father to you
than your father ever was,

210
00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:10.658
God rest his soul.

211
00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:13.912
- Dad is not dead.
- He's dead to me, the son of a bitch.

212
00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.164
- Don't talk about Dad that way!
- Don't you raise your voice to me!

213
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.333
- You're getting emotional, Lois.
- I am not getting emotional!

214
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.003
All right. I am leaving
this house in five minutes,

215
00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:25.632
and if you want to be on that bus,
I suggest you pull yourself together.

216
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.220
Sometimes I wonder
if you still love him.

217
00:15:31.388 --> 00:15:32.472
Who?

218
00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:35.516
- Dad.
- Are you crazy?

219
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:38.102
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well, you must have loved him once.

220
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.024
Honey, I was 18 when I met your father
and about as dumb as a piece of ham.

221
00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:46.819
What did I know about love?
All I knew was...

222
00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:54.869
He was the hottest thing
that I had ever seen.

223
00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:59.540
Oh, he looked like a panther,

224
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.709
a sex panther.

225
00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:06.839
- Sounds like love to me.
- Well, there's a big difference

226
00:16:07.007 --> 00:16:10.593
between love and mindless,
animalistic, carnal lust.

227
00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.596
And what do you have with Stuart?

228
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.142
What I have with Stuart
is what I want for you and William.

229
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.229
- A mature, stable relationship.
- But are you happy?

230
00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:24.399
Of course I'm happy. I'm very happy.

231
00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:26.901
Very, very happy.

232
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:29.404
No, no. Very happy.

233
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:31.531
Very happy.

234
00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:34.325
- I gotta go. The bus is here.
- All right.

235
00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.208
Very happy.

236
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:04.689
There she is. There's my beautiful girl!

237
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:07.358
Hey! Keep it down.

238
00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:12.113
I will eat your head! I will
tear it off, shove it up your ass,

239
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:15.408
pull it through your mouth,
brush my teeth with it, and then eat it!

240
00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.201
- I will eat it.
- Smitty!

241
00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.454
I'm not finished. Eat it!

242
00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:23.583
- Dad.
- What?

243
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.960
- Apologize to him.
- Oh, come on.

244
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:31.257
I'm serious, Dad. It's just rude. Now.

245
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:33.676
Do it now, Dad.

246
00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:40.475
Hey, Dave. I'm sorry.

247
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.311
Smitty, I'm working
on my appeal over here.

248
00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:46.272
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

249
00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:52.153
You see, that's why
I love you so much, Baby Bear.

250
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.197
You got your mother's good heart.

251
00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.451
What's wrong?

252
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:01.746
No, nothing.
William asked me to marry him.

253
00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.040
But that's good.
That's what you wanted, no?

254
00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.374
Yeah.

255
00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:09.253
No.

256
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.173
Oh, Dad, I don't know. I just...

257
00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:17.386
I mean, how are you supposed to know
when you're with the right person?

258
00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:22.308
Just listen to your heart, Baby Bear.

259
00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:23.518
You'll know.

260
00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:28.481
Hey, do you know what I do
when I'm feeling blue?

261
00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:31.359
Yeah. You drink homemade toilet wine.

262
00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:32.527
No!

263
00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:36.697
Well, yeah. But I also write
in my gratitude journal.

264
00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:39.617
And every day, I write about the things
that I have to be grateful for,

265
00:18:39.785 --> 00:18:42.370
like you and your mother.

266
00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:45.081
Oh, here.

267
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:49.919
"December 25th, Christmas Day.

268
00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:54.006
"I am grateful that somebody finally
stabbed that cocksucker Rodriguez."

269
00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:55.550
Dad.

270
00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:02.348
I'm gonna say yes.

271
00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:03.516
Yes!

272
00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:06.227
I mean, we get along so well, right?

273
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:09.397
He's so funny.
He cracks me up, you guys.

274
00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:16.279
- I'm gonna say yes.
- That's great. Right, Matador?

275
00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.072
I think William is kind of a turd.

276
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.616
- Really?
- Yeah.

277
00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:26.289
But he's like a turd
with a piece of candy in it.

278
00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:29.250
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

279
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.172
Marriage isn't in our blood.
We're circus folk.

280
00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:38.467
Gypsies roaming from big top to big top
on the open road.

281
00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.721
You guys have been working in the diner
since I've known you.

282
00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:45.224
Not in here, Katie. Not in here.

283
00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:55.109
Gentlemen, observe.

284
00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:03.451
(SCREAMING)

285
00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:06.037
Can I get you guys anything else?

286
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.415
Will you marry me?

287
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.709
- Excuse me?
- Will you marry me?

288
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:17.715
Seriously. Think about it.
What could possibly be more romantic

289
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.801
than throwing away your entire life
and running off with some handsome,

290
00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:24.388
dark-haired stranger
you spotted across a restaurant?

291
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.896
I'm sorry. He's had a lot of syrup.

292
00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:35.107
- Okay.
- Okay, he's had a lot of syrup?

293
00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.776
Okay, I'll marry you.

294
00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:43.157
- What?
- Yes. Yes.

295
00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:45.910
I'll marry you!

296
00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:50.248
Jane! Jane! Will you cover for me?

297
00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:51.415
Where're you going?

298
00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:52.625
(SCREAMING)

299
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:56.128
I'm getting married! To this guy!

300
00:20:57.756 --> 00:20:59.674
Come on. Come on!

301
00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:02.635
Go. Get out of here. I got the bill.

302
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.020
Oh!

303
00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.439
Anderson.

304
00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:17.358
- Katie.
- Katie. Hi.

305
00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:25.074
Two kisses.

306
00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:30.079
Big rig. Watch this.

307
00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.873
Stick that arm up your ass!

308
00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:51.309
d Got a brand new roof above my head

309
00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:56.355
d All the empty boxes thrown away

310
00:21:57.649 --> 00:22:00.568
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:03.154
So years from now,
when we're celebrating

312
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:05.740
our 37th wedding anniversary

313
00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:11.078
and one of our friends
asks us about our first date,

314
00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:14.457
- is this what we'll talk about?
- I guess it is.

315
00:22:14.624 --> 00:22:16.959
Yeah. Okay.

316
00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:19.253
And... And then I'll tell them
the funny part.

317
00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:21.422
What's the funny part?

318
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.759
That after we talked about it,
you stepped in dog shit.

319
00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:30.097
- Oh! I stepped in dog shit!
- Yeah.

320
00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:31.682
Why didn't you warn me?
You could have warned me.

321
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.267
That would have ruined the story.

322
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:36.479
Ah, man. Can I borrow your...

323
00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:37.855
Oh, God! Cut it out!

324
00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.523
ANDERSON: Okay, careful, careful.

325
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:52.787
- I've never been up here before.
- Yeah, it's a cool place to come

326
00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:57.249
if you want to get an old refrigerator
filled with vomit.

327
00:22:57.793 --> 00:22:59.210
I was looking for one of those.

328
00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:02.171
Yeah? Well, I think
it's two-for-one day, so...

329
00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:06.717
Look what I've got.

330
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.762
Tetanus?

331
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:15.393
(SIGHS)

332
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.686
- This is stupid.
- What?

333
00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:21.732
You know, this. Us sitting up here,
pretending we're doing something.

334
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.360
- It's just stupid.
- It is, right?

335
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:26.362
I mean, obviously
we're not getting married.

336
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.072
Obviously.

337
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.118
- Strangers don't get married.
- Well, in some cultures they do.

338
00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.370
- They do?
- But not ours.

339
00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:37.164
Not ours.
Other cultures, far-away cultures.

340
00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:39.667
The Kalahari bushmen is one example.

341
00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:42.420
- And my parents did. They did.
- They did?

342
00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:43.921
My mom barely knew my dad,

343
00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.631
and she got pregnant with me,
and they eloped

344
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.509
to this weird little place
called The House of Wedded Bliss

345
00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:50.886
- in Atlantic City.
- The House of Wedded Bliss?

346
00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:55.391
Yeah.
Doesn't that sound incredibly romantic?

347
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.893
Sounds like a bad Chinese takeout place.

348
00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:05.693
Yeah, well, I mean, just because they
did, doesn't mean that we are, right?

349
00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:10.448
You probably weren't even serious
when you asked.

350
00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:14.493
- Were you?
- Of course not.

351
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:20.916
You see, that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, this whole thing is just...

352
00:24:21.084 --> 00:24:22.084
It's stupid.

353
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:26.005
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

354
00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:27.548
Wait, wait, wait. What's happening?

355
00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:31.051
- I'm just such an idiot.
- Are you crying?

356
00:24:31.219 --> 00:24:33.220
- No.
- Why are you crying?

357
00:24:34.347 --> 00:24:36.056
I am not crying.

358
00:24:38.518 --> 00:24:40.728
It really looks like you're crying.

359
00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:42.605
Yeah, well, I'm crying now.

360
00:24:42.772 --> 00:24:45.858
Are you satisfied, you asshole?

361
00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:48.861
Hey. Hey, hey.

362
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:51.489
Hey. Hey, you.

363
00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:55.159
Hey! Hey.

364
00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:02.583
Are you okay?

365
00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:08.631
I can't remember the last time I did
that. I don't think I've ever done that.

366
00:25:09.466 --> 00:25:13.511
- Do you want a tissue?
- No, I'm fine. I feel incredible.

367
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:17.097
- Really?
- Why is that?

368
00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:21.477
- You sure you don't want a tissue?
- No, I'm fine.

369
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:26.607
Anderson, when you asked me
to marry you,

370
00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:30.611
you probably picked the only girl
in the whole world that would say yes.

371
00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:33.072
I don't think that's a coincidence,
do you?

372
00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:35.449
I don't know.

373
00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:37.952
- Do you believe in fate?
- No.

374
00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:42.581
Neither do I.
You see, this was meant to be.

375
00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:44.708
Will you marry me?

376
00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:47.294
- TED: You said yes?
- Yeah. Well, why not?

377
00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:51.715
You know, I think this is exactly what
I need to get my life back on track.

378
00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:53.759
I mean,
why can't two strangers get married?

379
00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:57.471
- I don't know. Because it's retarded?
- Look, you said it yourself.

380
00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:59.807
You said I need to get back out there
and meet people. Right? So...

381
00:25:59.975 --> 00:26:01.809
Yeah, meet! Meet! Not marry!

382
00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:04.770
Why can't you just date her for a while
like a normal human being?

383
00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:06.772
Look, don't worry. Okay? It's not...

384
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.983
You know, it's not like
we're getting married today.

385
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.318
We talked about it,
and we decided to take things slow.

386
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:13.988
- So what's next?
- She's moving in with me.

387
00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:15.155
I gotta go.

388
00:26:17.117 --> 00:26:19.410
Okay. Well, good luck with that.

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:32.047

390
00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:36.552

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.764

394

a sound, a sound

395
00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:57.364
d But I must get from there to here

396
00:26:57.532 --> 00:27:02.620
d There's a small voice crying on the
other side of the river from here

397
00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:05.581
d It's too late to phone her now

398
00:27:05.832 --> 00:27:10.169
William, I have some weird news.
It's good news for me.

399
00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:14.798
I can't marry you. I'll explain
everything later. I'm so sorry.

400
00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:19.470
I love you... As a friend. Okay, bye.

d The river looks so good tonight

404
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.192
Can I leave a message for 99138?

405
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.903
d I don't know what's with your friend

406
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.197

d She said she'd had enough
of playing games

408
00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.621
It's from my daughter.
She's getting married.

409
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:46.872
Oh, yeah?

410
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.542
It's too bad you're not gonna be there
to walk her down the aisle, big guy.

412

- What is this?
- I'm getting married!

413

- No, this.
- It's a diaphragm.

Please. Please.

- It's her diaphragm.
- Stuart!

- Damn it!
- Jeez.

- You said yes!
- Not to William.

420
00:28:22.158 --> 00:28:23.701
Not to William?

421
00:28:25.453 --> 00:28:27.955
His name's Anderson.
I met him a couple of hours ago.

422
00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:29.665
A couple of hours ago?

423
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:32.626
What kind of... What about William?
What kind of name is Anderson?

424
00:28:32.794 --> 00:28:35.129
- Use your head here, Katie.
- He's black, isn't he?

425
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:37.631
I have to go.

426
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:39.758
Don't you think
you're being a little impulsive?

427
00:28:39.926 --> 00:28:44.638
Yes! That is exactly what I'm being.
And guess what? It feels great!

428
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.268
- You ready?
- Oh, my God.

429
00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:51.687
- Hi.
- Hey, there, dude.

430
00:28:51.855 --> 00:28:53.355
You must be Anderson.

431
00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:54.523
- No.
- Matador.

432
00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:57.818
This is my friend, Matador.
He's just giving me a ride.

433
00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:59.737
I like your Jew hat.

434
00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:11.874
Bye, Mom. I'll bring him by
for you to meet him tomorrow!

- Can you see?
- No.

437

No problem.
You know, this happens all the time.

438
00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:19.733
How can you see?

439
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:23.237
Just be patient!
This will clear up in a second.

440
00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:25.072
Okay, slow down.

441
00:30:25.406 --> 00:30:27.074

- Slow down.

to make the introductions?

Yeah.

press your balls into my shin?

- Can do.
- Thank you. Thank you.

- I will.

- Does it hurt?
- No, it's fine.

- You're so brave.
- Listen. Listen, Katie...

- Hey, where's your bedroom?
- Bedroom?

493
00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:03.081
Yeah. I need to put this somewhere.

494
00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:05.375
- What's this?
- My clothes.

495
00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:08.462
- Your clothes?
- Yeah, you know, for wearing.

496
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:13.592
Oh, clothes. Right.
I thought you said "cloves." Cloves.

497
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.219
And I was like,
"Cloves, that's a weird thing to pack."

Okay, yeah. You found the bedroom.

499
00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:24.436
So, yup. So this... This is the bedroom.
This is the bedroom.

500
00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:26.646
I should probably clean up a little.

501
00:34:26.814 --> 00:34:28.315
Good. Good.

502
00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:31.735
So listen, I was thinking about
everything and how great this is,

503
00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:34.112
but it's all happening so fast,
and I was afraid

504
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.281
that maybe you thought it
was happening too fast.

505
00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:37.991
That's what makes it so exciting.

506
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:41.244
Exactly. Exactly.
That's what I was exactly going to say.

507
00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:42.996
Because personally,
I couldn't be more thrilled.

508
00:34:43.164 --> 00:34:44.414
Well, you seem really nervous.

509
00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:47.834
Really? No, no, no. I don't...
That's weird. I don't get nervous.

00:34:48.002 --> 00:34:51.838
I just express joy
by sweating on occasion.

511
00:34:52.006 --> 00:34:54.174
- Who's Vanessa?
- Who?

512
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:56.593
You said "Vanessa"
right before you passed out.

513
00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:59.012
- I did?
- Oh, is this her?

514
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.766
No. No, that's not her.
I don't know who that is.

515
00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:05.644
That's... That picture
came with the frame.

516
00:35:05.853 --> 00:35:07.729
But you're in the picture.

517
00:35:10.024 --> 00:35:12.651
Yeah, there I am, right there. I know.

518
00:35:12.819 --> 00:35:14.778
That's because I used to do
some modeling when I was younger.

519
00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.822
- Really?
- Yes, I did.

520
00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:20.951
I did some picture frame modeling
back when that whole "regular guy" phase

521
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.286
was sweeping the picture frame
modeling industry.

522
00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:25.622
- That is so cool.
- Yeah.

Should I get it?

526
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:46.852
No. No, no, no.
It's my mom. I'll call her back.

527
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:49.396
- Oh, should I say hi?
- That's okay.

528
00:35:49.564 --> 00:35:51.857
No, really, it's weird.
I mean, I should say hi, right?

529
00:35:52.024 --> 00:35:54.901
No, no. That's... I got it. I got it.

- I gotta go, Mom. I love you.

536

there and meet them before we...

- Where?
- Yup, this way. Yes. Yeah, you got it.

588

and get some saline solution.

No. I'm fine.

get some saline
or eye drops or something.

00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:48.968
No, really.

593
00:39:50.971 --> 00:39:52.931

- Okay. Slow down. What's the problem?

I'm so embarrassed.
I mean, I feel like such an idiot.

598
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:09.906
- Maybe you came on a little strong.
- Oh, God.

599
00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:13.660
A couple hours ago, she was moving in.
All your problems were solved,

602

What?

603
00:40:20.376 --> 00:40:23.670
- What would Vanessa say? Huh?
- Oh, buddy.

I was just trying to be spontaneous,
you know?

605
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.842

606
00:40:29.009 --> 00:40:31.636
No. Trust me. You're not a freak.

1190
01:20:04.716 --> 01:20:08.761
I'd like to welcome you all
to The House of Wedded Bliss.

1191
01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:14.475
A couple who marries here,
I personally guarantee,

1192
01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:18.562
that's a marriage
that's gonna last for life.

1193
01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:23.984
And we never forget a face.
Ain't that right, Lois and Smitty?

1194
01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.194
Big Bear.

1195
01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.740
Now, on to the business at hand.

1196
01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:34.411
Anderson, do you take this woman
to be your wife?

1197
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.298
Do you?

1198
01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:48.926
Anderson?

1199
01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:57.768
Sorry. I don't.

1200
01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:01.021
Vanessa, when I met you,
I thought you were perfect.

1201
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:03.899
And you are. I mean...
I mean, look at you.

1202
01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:11.740
But then I met Katie,
and she's perfect for me.

1203
01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:18.455
I'm sorry. Are you...
You're heartbroken.

1204
01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:21.584
Anderson, I want you to meet somebody.

1205
01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:23.669
You remember Morty, right?

1206
01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:25.754
"Shooter, shooter. We got a shooter."

1207
01:21:25.922 --> 01:21:29.383
He killed himself after I died.
Isn't that so romantic?

1208
01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:36.098
I couldn't live without her, dude.
I know, we just met. But she's the one.

1209
01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:40.144
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, I think I do.

1210
01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:43.022
Listen, babe, we gotta blow.
I'll be in the Humvee.

1211
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:48.402
Bye.

1212
01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:58.746
Do you want to get back
to your wedding now, son?

1213
01:22:04.377 --> 01:22:05.711
I do.

1214
01:22:08.673 --> 01:22:12.801
Son, you've got to wait
until you say "I do."

1215
01:22:15.221 --> 01:22:16.221
Son?

1216
01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:20.267
(SIGHS)

1217
01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:22.603
I do. I do. I do.

1218
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.981
You got a ring? Because if you don't,
we have some splendid ones

1219
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:27.816
in the gift shop for $19.95.

1220
01:22:27.984 --> 01:22:30.069
No. No, no, no. I have a ring.

1221
01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.410
I have another ring.

1222
01:22:40.538 --> 01:22:42.247
Remember this?

1223
01:22:56.137 --> 01:23:02.059
By the power vested in me,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

1224
01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.272
d Everybody's gonna love today

1225
01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.358
d Gonna love today

1226
01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:12.736
d Everybody's gonna love today
Gonna love today

1227
01:23:12.904 --> 01:23:16.699
d Anyway you want to
Anyway you've got to

1228
01:23:16.866 --> 01:23:22.913
d Love, love me
Love, love me

1229
01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.081
(SIREN SOUNDS)

1230
01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.583
- SHERIFF: All right, freeze!
- I LoJacked your ass.

1231
01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:29.086
That's him right there!
Arrest him! Arrest him!

1232
01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.671
- Arrest him!
- All right. Hey!

1233
01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:33.716
- That is my ear, my friend.
- Sorry.

1234
01:23:33.883 --> 01:23:36.093
How would you like it
if I did that to you?

1235
01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:39.471
- I said I'm sorry.
- Alrighty.

1236
01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:42.266
On a personal note,

1237
01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.519
I understand we have
some newlyweds here.

1238
01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:46.979
Yes. Yes, sir. That's...

1239
01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:53.777
I'd like to offer the congratulations
of myself and the whole team.

1240
01:23:53.945 --> 01:23:54.945
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- That's nice.

1241
01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:56.530
- It is.
- That's cool.

1242
01:24:02.203 --> 01:24:04.079
We didn't know
where you were registered.

1243
01:24:04.247 --> 01:24:05.247
Oh, wow.

1244
01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:08.542
It's a blender.
I had some help picking it out.

1245
01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:11.295
William?

1246
01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:14.131
I realized something today, Katie.

1247
01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:17.134
No matter how hard you try
to plan your life,

1248
01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:21.680
life has a plan for you all its own.

1249
01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:23.140
Good luck.

1250
01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:26.018
- Thank you, guys.
- Guys, thank you.

1251
01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:28.020
Why is he hugging the cop?

1252
01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.064
Okay, guys, now.

1253
01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:31.648
- Very nice.
- No, seriously,

1254
01:24:31.816 --> 01:24:34.276
- why is he hugging the cop?
- All right.

1255
01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:40.365
On a professional note,
y'all are under arrest.

1256
01:24:40.533 --> 01:24:42.618
Right. Just...

1257
01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:45.913
Considering we might not all be
together again for quite some time,

1258
01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:49.500
Katie and I were hoping to get a picture
before we all go off to the big house.

1259
01:24:49.667 --> 01:24:52.252
- What a great idea.
- The big house.

1260
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.962
- You want me to do it?
- Would you?

1261
01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:55.714
- All right.
- Oh, come on!

1262
01:24:55.882 --> 01:25:00.052
Hey! You know, you are walking
on thin ice here, my friend!

1263
01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.930
You are on very thin ice!

1264
01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:05.849
Let me see it.

1265
01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:08.185
Don't forget to push the button
for the flash.

1266
01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:10.229
Get in here, you guys.

1267
01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:14.775
SHERIFF: Could you
all just scooch in a little?

1268
01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.237
One, two,

1269
01:25:18.404 --> 01:25:19.696
three.

d I love love
I love being in love

1271
01:25:23.701 --> 01:25:27.204
d I don't care what it does to me

1272
01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:30.833
d Take these tattered boxes
that used to hold your clothes

1273
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.045
d Break them down
Build them back up with your bones

1274
01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:39.216
d Now all you do is construct a mess
You're good to me when only flesh

1275
01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:43.095
d You're a memory with nothing to show

1276
01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:44.847
d When we would take trips

1277
01:25:45.014 --> 01:25:47.015
d We swore we'd never take pictures

1278
01:25:47.183 --> 01:25:51.228
d Pictures only prove
you can't convince

1279
01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:53.397
d Now I wish those photographs

1280
01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:56.275
d Could convince you that
what we had would only

1281
01:25:56.442 --> 01:25:58.110
d Turn out a negative

1282
01:25:58.278 --> 01:26:00.195
d Well well well

1283
01:26:00.363 --> 01:26:03.699
d If fingertips are relationships

1284
01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:08.245
d Then I could barely carry your weight

1285
01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.581
d If fingers are mistakes

1286
01:26:10.748 --> 01:26:13.917
d Don't use this one
to point the blame

1287
01:26:14.085 --> 01:26:17.796
d Just sing sing

1288
01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:21.633

d We'll take our chances
We'll last a month

1293
01:26:33.771 --> 01:26:38.442
d We'll never speak again
How I love being in love

1294
01:26:53.499 --> 01:26:55.667
d And don't pick up the line

1295
01:26:55.835 --> 01:26:58.003
d You're dressed to have a good time

1296
01:26:58.171 --> 01:27:01.632
d You don't need him
You need to be seen

1297
01:27:01.799 --> 01:27:06.428
d So someone else can treat you wrong
So you my love can sing this song

1298

I'll claim that's what I want

1302
01:27:21.986 --> 01:27:26.240
d To be the new statistic
How I love

1303
01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:31.370
