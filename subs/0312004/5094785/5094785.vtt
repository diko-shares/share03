2
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.900
Cracking job, Gromit.

3
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.620
Hang on, old chum.

4
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.020
- What's going on?
- Who is it?

5
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.500
Reel him in, lad.

6
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.900
To me. To me.

7
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.300
Gotcha! Thieving monster.

8
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.100
Me prize pumpkin.

9
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.060
Me little baby. Me pride and joy.

10
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.700
You've saved it, Anti-Pesto.

11
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.420
It was nothing at all, Mrs...

12
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.380
- Everything's under control.
- Oh, no!

13
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.100
Don't worry, madam.

14
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.780
Thank you, Mr. Wallace.

15
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.820
All in a night's work, Mrs. Mulch.

16
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.820
Cute little feller, isn't he?

17
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.620
You'd never believe
they'd cause so much damage.

18
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.460
Oh, he may look innocent, sir.

19
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.620
But left to his own devices,

20
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.100
this is the ultimate
vegetable-destroying machine.

21
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.740
Reg, me teeth!

22
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.980
Job well done, lad.

23
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.340
Subject disarmed and neutralized.

24
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.620
Bless you, Anti-Pesto.

25
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.980
With you out there protecting our veg,

26
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.180
the most important event
of the year is safe.

27
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.580
Aye. And I hope they give them pests
what's coming to 'em, and all.

28
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.420
Amen to that, Mrs. Mulch.

29
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.180
It was a long, hard night
last night, Gromit.

30
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.140
I'll need a good, hearty
breakfast under me belt.

31
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.980
Pile it up, lad.

32
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.060
I'm in the mood for food!

33
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.980
Gromit, old pal.

34
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.940
It's happened again.
I'll need assistance.

35
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.580
Well, thanks, chuck.

36
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.500
I'm sure that hole's getting smaller.

37
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.500
Another successful night.
How are the inmates?

38
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.820
Must be getting
a bit full down there.

39
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.620
Talking of which.

40
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.340
Now, for a great big plate of...

41
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.580
...vegetables.

42
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.020
Still got me on the diet, eh, Gromit?

43
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.940
Watching me shape?
There's a good dog.

44
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.500
Gromit, lad?

45
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.780
How is that prize melon
of yours coming on?

46
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.580
Must be a while
since you measured it.

47
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.020
Lovely food. For rabbits, that is.

48
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.220
As for me, I need something
a bit more cheesy.

49
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.540
Caught red-handed, eh, lad?

50
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.940
I'm sorry, Gromit.

51
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.660
I know you're doing this
for my own good,

52
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.460
but the fact is
I'm just crackers about cheese.

53
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.100
Look, if I must change me ways,

54
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220
at least let me do it my way.

55
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.900
With technology.

56
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.260
It's time we tried my latest invention,

57
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.940
the Mind Manipulation-omatic.

58
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.860
It extracts unwanted
thoughts and desires.

59
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.220
I haven't tested it yet,
but it should be perfectly safe.

60
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.700
Just a bit of harmless
brain alteration, that's all.

61
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.660
Anti-Pesto Humane Pest Control.
How might we be of assistance?

62
00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.140
Yes. Lady Tottington here
of Tottington Hall.

63
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.540
Your Ladyship.

64
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.700
This is an honor.

65
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.340
It's a disaster. I have
the most terrible rabbit problem.

66
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.180
The competition's only days away.
You simply have to do something.

67
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.820
Certainly, ma'am. I think we're
about to go up in the world, lad.

68
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.580
Just stay right where you are,
your Ladyship,

69
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.820
and we'll be with you in an...

70
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.700
In an hour? I can't wait an hour.

71
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.100
I have a major infestation.
Hello? Hello?

72
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.980
That's more like it.

73
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.980
Thank goodness you've...

74
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.300
What ho! For you, my love.

75
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.060
Victor. How lovely and... unexpected.

76
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.980
Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother
and toodled on over

77
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.420
to sort the blighters out.

78
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.020
Gosh, that's awfully sweet of you.

79
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.820
But you really needn't bother.

80
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.660
It's no bother, little boo-boo. It's
the least a chap can do for his filly.

81
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.260
Don't want pests spoiling
our beautiful manor house, do we?

82
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.020
"Our" manor house?

83
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.580
No one's mentioned marriage, Victor.

84
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.580
All in good time, my dear.

85
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.540
Vermin first, though, what what.

86
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.420
Come on, Phillip.

87
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.420
Victor!

88
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.860
We can deal with this humanely.

89
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.100
Very classy.

90
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.140
Just the sort of client
we should be dealing with, eh, lad?

91
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.980
Burrowing bounders!

92
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.460
They must be breeding like...

93
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.060
...well, rabbits.

94
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.860
Only one thing for it, lad.

95
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.420
Victor, hadn't we agreed?

96
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.660
No more thoughtless killing.

97
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.140
Quite right, my dear.

98
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.700
So I've thought this one through
very carefully.

99
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.340
It's off to bunny heaven
for you, big ears.

100
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.700
Victor! No!

101
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.700
What the...?

102
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.540
Champion sucker, eh, Gromit?

103
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.060
The BunVac 6000.

104
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.100
This'll impress her Ladyship.

105
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.020
I don't understand.
It should have been a bull's-eye.

106
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.580
Oh, Victor. I felt we'd
made a real breakthrough

107
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.300
with this hunting obsession of yours.
I really thought you'd changed.

108
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.860
I'm sorry, Campanula,
but I am what I am.

109
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.460
There's no nonsense
with Victor Quartermaine.

110
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.180
What you see is what you get.

111
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.540
What the...?

112
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.380
Sounds like a really big brute,
this one.

113
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.700
Give it some more welly.

114
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.700
Gosh!

115
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.980
Maybe I should've
used a bigger nozzle.

116
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.740
Anti-Pesto, you're here.

117
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.220
Your Ladyship.

118
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.540
My darlings!

119
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.900
You're safe.

120
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.100
My word!

121
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.980
What a fabulous job you've done.
And not a single one harmed.

122
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.980
The old BV6000, ma'am.

123
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.180
Capable of 125 RPM.
That's rabbits per minute.

124
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.860
How inspired!

125
00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.340
- Mr...?
- Oh, Wallace.

126
00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.020
Mr. Wallace.

127
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.260
Is this all of them?

128
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.940
Just one left.
Hoist her up, Gromit.

129
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.100
Victor, stop fooling around in the dirt
and have a look at this.

130
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.380
The ingenious Anti-Pesto

131
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.060
have completely dealt
with my rabbit problem.

132
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.380
- Isn't it marvelous?
- Marvelous?

133
00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.460
Marvelous?

134
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.500
This confounded contraption
virtually suffocated me!

135
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.100
Besides, the job's only half done.

136
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.500
How do you intend
to finish these vermin off?

137
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.540
Crush 'em? Liquidize 'em?

138
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.260
- They're humane.
- Humane?

139
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:44.180
Well, then perhaps they'd be humane
enough to give me back my dignity.

140
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.820
I want...

141
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.420
Toupee, please.

142
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.420
Oh, grand.
We take check or cash.

143
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.780
Toupee, you idiot!
My hair is in your machine.

144
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.100
Oh, no, it's only rabbits in there.

145
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.340
The hare, I think you'll find,
is a much larger mammal.

146
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.140
Out of my way, fool.

147
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.140
I'm sorry, my dear, but I refuse
to suffer any further humiliation

148
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.900
at the hands of these
blundering nitwits.

149
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.580
I therefore bid you good day.

150
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.820
Thank you for ridding me
of a real problem, Mr. Wallace.

151
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.940
Tell me, what exactly will you do
with all these rabbits?

152
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.660
Trade secret.

153
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.500
Yes. I'd be happy to let them roam free
if it wasn't for the competition.

154
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.460
But they do so love their veg.

155
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.140
It's in their little bunny natures,
and you can't change that, can you?

156
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.820
No.

157
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.780
Or can you?

158
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.500
Why didn't we think of it before, lad?

159
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.980
The solution to all
our storage problems.

160
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.620
Simply by connecting the BunVac

161
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.420
to the Mind Manipulation-omatic,

162
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.140
we can brainwash the bunnies.

163
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.900
Rabbit rehabilitation.

164
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:24.500
Once cured of their antisocial
veg-ravaging behavior,

165
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.860
the rabbits can be safely released
without fear of re-offending.

166
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.340
Just a little added lunar power
to enhance the mind waves...

167
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.100
...and we can begin.

168
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.540
Veg, bad.

169
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.380
Veg, bad.

170
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.820
Veg, bad.

171
00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.420
Say no to carrots,

172
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.860
cabbage and cauliflower.

173
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.780
Well, come on, lad,
what are you waiting for?

174
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.660
Turn on the BunVac.

175
00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.220
Full suction.

176
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.100
It's working, Gromit.
It's working!

177
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.460
Their tiny bunny brains

178
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.940
are being saturated
in my veg-free mind waves.

179
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.180
Another 30 minutes
brainwashing should suffice.

180
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.740
Then we can move on
to the conditioning.

181
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.140
Gromit!

182
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.380
Switch it off!

183
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.860
Get it off!

184
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.380
Get it off me, lad!

185
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.820
Oh, thanks, lad.

186
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.580
Quick.

187
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.540
Give us a carrot.

188
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.620
It worked, Gromit!

189
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.940
A reformed rabbit.

190
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.460
We'll call him Hutch. Shall we?

191
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.580
Come on. Let's get the kettle on.

192
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.940
We'll see to him in the morning.

193
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.020
I feel we're on the cusp
of a real breakthrough, lad.

194
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.660
Mankind freed from
rabbit problems forever.

195
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.020
Lady Tottington will be impressed.

196
00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.220
Good night.

197
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.620
Sleep tight.

198
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.500
And don't let the bed bugs bite.

199
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.500
Good night, Gromit.

200
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.300
Sweet dreams, old chum.

201
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.180
Protect and nourish the frail
and the weak, O Lord.

202
00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.460
Protect and nourish the frail
and the weak, O Lord.

203
00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.260
Let them grow big and strong
under Thy loving care.

204
00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.580
In fact, let them grow bigger
and stronger than anyone else's,

205
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.780
so that the first prize might be mine.

206
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.940
Amen.

207
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.940
The harvest offering
to bind the deal.

208
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.580
We plow the fields
and scatter the good seed on...

209
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.780
He sends the snow in winter...

210
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.380
All good gifts around us

211
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.700
Are sent from...

212
00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.140
Heavens above.

213
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.340
Hello?

214
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.820
Hello? Is anybody there?

215
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.420
Mrs. Mulch?

216
00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.180
Please, come forward,
whoever you are.

217
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.820
There's no need to be afraid.

218
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:33.620
You're hungry.
Then please, take what you like.

219
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.740
It is for the needy, after all.

220
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.420
No! No! No! No!

221
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.140
Mercy!

222
00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.100
Morning, Gromit.

223
00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.780
A pest-free night per... chance?

224
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.140
Lummy day.

225
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.660
- It's a disaster.
- Me garden's ruined.

226
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.500
- It's a disaster.
- Me garden's ruined.

227
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.140
- It's carnage out there.
- Where were Anti-Pesto?

228
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.860
Simmer down.
Simmer down, now.

229
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.940
Right. One at a time, if ya please.

230
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.860
We pay good money
for our crop protection.

231
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:27.180
If ya can't deliver the goods,
maybe you should keep your traps shut.

232
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.900
I never saw such cauliflower carnage.

233
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.060
Worse than the
Great Slug Blight of '32,

234
00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.780
when there were slugs
the size of pigs.

235
00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.900
Growbag's right. The slugs are back!

236
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.140
The slugs are back!

237
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.220
That's enough! That's enough!

238
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.860
Look, this flippin'
vegetable competition

239
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.660
- causes nothin' but trouble every year.
- Here we go.

240
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.380
- If ya ask me...
- Get on with ya!

241
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.460
Know what? I'll tell ya.
If ya ask me, this was arson.

242
00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.940
- Arson?
- Aye!

243
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.580
Someone arsin' around.

244
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.900
That's right.
One of you lot. A man.

245
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.340
- This was no man.
- What are you saying?

246
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.660
Does a man have teeth

247
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.500
the size of axe blades?

248
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.380
Or ears like terrible tombstones?

249
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.500
By tampering with nature,

250
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.100
forcing vegetables to swell
far beyond their natural size,

251
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.820
we have brought a terrible judgment
upon ourselves.

252
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.460
Hey! Give over!

253
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.260
You're mental.

254
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.540
And for our sins,

255
00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.420
a hideous creature
has been sent to punish us all!

256
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.620
Repent! Repent!

257
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.300
Lest you too, taste the wrath of...

258
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.260
...the Were-Rabbit!

259
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.220
This is terrible!
What's going to happen to us?

260
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.340
- Doomed!
- Who's going to help us?

261
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.500
- What's to become of the show?
- We live for that competition.

262
00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.100
- Get off me.
- We're simple folk. It's all we have.

263
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.540
- Who will save us?
- Get... Hey!

264
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.140
A Were-Rabbit?

265
00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.420
Oh, come, come, now.

266
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.020
I do believe the vicar's been
to the communion wine again.

267
00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.140
What we are dealing with here
is no supernatural rabbit.

268
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.540
It's a big fellow, perhaps.

269
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.940
But a mortal creature
of flesh and blood.

270
00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.500
A matter easily dealt with
by a hunter.

271
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.860
Guns will not be necessary,
thank you, Victor.

272
00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.940
Hasn't there been enough destruction?

273
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.580
I believe the killing
of fluffy creatures

274
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.700
is never justified.

275
00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.700
I say we give Anti-Pesto
a second chance.

276
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.740
What? How on earth would
those tiny-minded buffoons

277
00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.580
ever catch such a big rabbit?

278
00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.140
Mr. Wallace?

279
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.020
Well...

280
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.100
With a big trap.

281
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.220
By Jove. He's... He's got it!

282
00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.620
- Genius!
- Genius!

283
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.420
- Brilliant.
- What a great idea!

284
00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.820
Clever.

285
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.660
You see, Victor,

286
00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.740
there's hope for the vegetables yet.

287
00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.220
Not the ones I'm looking at.

288
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.700
That's me boys!

289
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.140
Love, Gromit.

290
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.180
That's the biggest trap of all.

291
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.300
The "tender trap," they call it.

292
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.060
And that's what we'll use
to catch this thing.

293
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:07.100
Yes, lad, a lovely lady rabbit.

294
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.100
How could any
hot-blooded rabbit-beast resist?

295
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.500
Oh, come on, Gromit.

296
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.620
A bit more, you know, alluring.

297
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.100
Very cheeky.

298
00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.300
That's more like it, lad.

299
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.900
How can we possibly fail now?

300
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.020
You're a total knockout.

301
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.820
Stick around, lad.

302
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.660
Should fix back on quite easily.

303
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.580
Nighty-night, me lovelies.

304
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.820
Think big now.

305
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.620
No!

306
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.060
Don't worry. No. No.

307
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.620
Well, I'm very sorry, Mrs. Mulch.

308
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.540
We'll get there as soon as we can.
Mr. Dibber. Oh, yes.

309
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.500
Can I call you back? Mrs. Girdling.

310
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.340
- A tunnel you say?
- What do you intend to do about this?

311
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.180
I'll look into it.

312
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.580
So where did you get to, lad?

313
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.860
I thought I told you to stay put.

314
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.860
It's gone mad around here.

315
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.500
I thought we were
supposed to be a team.

316
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.900
How are we ever
gonna catch this thing

317
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.300
if you go gallivanting off
on your own all the time?

318
00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.940
You're doing it again!

319
00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.660
Where are you going now?

320
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.380
Gromit!

321
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.140
Grommy!

322
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.620
Really, lad.

323
00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:57.820
You do realize I've made
a personal promise to Lady Tottington.

324
00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.220
How is this sort of
behavior going to get us

325
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.140
any nearer to finding
a rabbit-mon... ster?

326
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.020
Hutch.

327
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.660
Oh, Gromit.

328
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.580
We've created a monster.

329
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.260
Hutch is the beast.

330
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.820
The lunar panels.

331
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:31.580
They must've over-stimulated
Hutch's primitive bunny nature.

332
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.940
And now, when the moon appears,

333
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.060
he undergoes
a hideous transformation.

334
00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.060
Oh, Gromit.

335
00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.340
This is absolutely...

336
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.740
...fantastic!

337
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.100
Don't you see, lad?

338
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.580
OK, so we've created
a veg-ravaging rabbit-monster.

339
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.140
But we've also captured it.

340
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.540
Just like I promised Lady Tottington.

341
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.140
I'll go and tell her the good news.

342
00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.180
Make sure he doesn't escape.

343
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.580
Bye!

344
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.460
Mr. Wallace.

345
00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.500
It's the beast, your Ladyship.
I bring great news.

346
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.100
Gosh, how exciting.
Please, do come in.

347
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.740
Well, this is simply spiffing news.

348
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.540
With the beast in captivity,
the competition can go ahead as planned.

349
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:24.260
You saved the day, Mr. Wallace.

350
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.340
It was nothing, your Ladyship.

351
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.460
So modest.

352
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.220
Oh, please, do help yourself.

353
00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.340
Thanks.

354
00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.900
I so appreciate you coming
all this way to let me know, Wallace.

355
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.900
Tell me, are you
a vegetable-lover yourself?

356
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.180
- They're... growing on me.
- Then come with me.

357
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.260
There's something
very special I want to show you.

358
00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.220
Hop in.

359
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.820
- It's very snug.
- It's my Jacob's ladder.

360
00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.940
And it goes all the way to heaven.

361
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.580
Welcome to my inner sanctum, Wallace.

362
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.020
My secret garden.

363
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.380
It's a veritable

364
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.900
vegetable paradise.

365
00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.220
I just knew you'd love it.

366
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.900
Unlike Victor.

367
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.460
He's never shown
any interest in my produce.

368
00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.340
- His loss, Lady Tottington.
- Please, Wallace.

369
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.660
Call me Totty.

370
00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.300
If anything were to happen
to my vegetables,

371
00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.060
I don't know what I'd do.

372
00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.220
I'm sure you understand, Mr. Wallace.

373
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.580
I can see that you're
a true nature lover.

374
00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.660
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

375
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.700
At first, I thought
I could change Victor.

376
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.740
Now I'm not so sure.

377
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.580
Do you think a man can change, Wallace?

378
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.220
Change?

379
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.540
Oh, yes.

380
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:25.500
Really, Phillip.
The things one does for love.

381
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.060
Pesto.

382
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.220
- Mr. Wallace.
- Oh, Totty.

383
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.420
Totty?

384
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.460
I'd like to show you one last thing.

385
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:52.460
Something no other man
has ever seen.

386
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.740
My carrot de Chantenay.

387
00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.380
Just smell it, Wallace.

388
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.740
- Feel its silken flesh.
- Oh, yes.

389
00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:05.580
Isn't it the most sumptuous,
succulent specimen you've ever seen?

390
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.660
- Yes!
- Doesn't it fill your heart

391
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.780
- with desire?
- Yes!

392
00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:12.220
Just imagine
what it would taste like.

393
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.220
What on earth
were you thinkin' of, lad?

394
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.060
Ruined a perfectly good piece
of fashionable knitwear, that did.

395
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.860
To say nothing of a relationship
with an important client.

396
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.900
It's lucky for us her Ladyship
was so understanding.

397
00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.780
Honestly, I don't know
what's got into you lately.

398
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.060
And slow down for pity's sake.

399
00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.060
You'll buckle me trunnions.

400
00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.980
Don't worry. I'll see to this.

401
00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.940
You stay here where you belong.
In the doghouse.

402
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.820
Right.

403
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.820
It's heavier than it looks.

404
00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.260
I know your little secret, Pesto.

405
00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:20.180
- I know exactly what's going on.
- Your Lordship...

406
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.020
Yes. You think you can
pilfer my filly, don't you?

407
00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.260
You think you can con
a woman out of her fortune?

408
00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.820
- Who, me?
- Well, I got here first!

409
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.300
I've spent a long time reeling in
that fluffy-headed bunny-lover.

410
00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.900
And I'm not about to let some
puddle-headed peasant poach her from me.

411
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.540
- Comprenez?
- Right-o.

412
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.540
I'll be off then. Ta-ta.

413
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.540
You're not going anywhere, Pesto.

414
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.340
Not until I've taught you
a jolly good lesson.

415
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.620
Come on! Queensberry rules!

416
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.580
Put 'em up, ya little pipsqueak.

417
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.180
You're shaking.

418
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.820
Don't tell me you're a scaredy-cat
as well as a scoundrel.

419
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.820
And don't think acting
like a big girl's blouse

420
00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.580
will get you out of it.

421
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.100
There's no mercy
with Victor Quartermaine.

422
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.820
What the dickens?

423
00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.380
What on earth...?

424
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.820
Phillip! Attack!

425
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:25.020
Attack!

426
00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.860
What the...?

427
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.180
Vicar!

428
00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.700
Vicar! Oh, where the devil is he?

429
00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:27.020
Do you want to confess?

430
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.900
I want to talk to you about...

431
00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.500
...the beast.

432
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.180
Everything you need
to know is in this book.

433
00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:43.660
- "Nun Wrestling."
- No. I meant this one.

434
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.020
Here. Here it is.

435
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.380
The hideous monster
plaguing our parish.

436
00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.980
The Were-Rabbit.

437
00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.980
So it's true.

438
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.340
The beast lurks
within all of us, my child.

439
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:20.140
The side that emerges at night
as the moon rises into the sky.

440
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.340
The side that
savagely rips the leaves

441
00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.780
off any innocent cabbage.

442
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.340
Spare me the sermon, Vicar.

443
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:31.180
Just tell me how I kill him.
I mean "it."

444
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.340
To kill such a creature

445
00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.980
would require nerves of steel

446
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.780
and...

447
00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.420
...a bullet.

448
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.940
A bullet?

449
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.100
A bullet.

450
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.060
A bull...

451
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.060
What kind of bullet?

452
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.620
A bullet of pure gold.

453
00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.700
Gold.

454
00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.180
Yes.

455
00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.540
Twenty-four karat.

456
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.460
Get out of my way.

457
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.180
Silly old fool.

458
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:15.540
Beware!
Beware of the beast within!

459
00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.620
Perfect re-entry, Gromit.

460
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.420
This veg diet's
doing the trick, eh, lad?

461
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.820
I feel smashing.

462
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.700
So how's our rabbit-monster?

463
00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.100
Hope you're keeping an eye on him.

464
00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.260
What's up, dog?

465
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.820
Well, fancy that.

466
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.020
Rabbit ears.

467
00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.980
That is a bit odd.

468
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.620
And what are you tryin' to say, lad?

469
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.180
What?

470
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.020
What?

471
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.340
What? You think that I'm the...?

472
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:08.460
Because of these?

473
00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:09.820
Oh, no.

474
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.340
No. This is just a reaction

475
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.500
to that healthy veg diet
you've got me on.

476
00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.060
It's the toxins coming out.

477
00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.300
Silly old pooch.

478
00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.660
Thinking I'm the beast.

479
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.100
Next thing you'll be saying

480
00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.260
is that Hutch
is turning into me.

481
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.980
Hey. What are you doing, lad?

482
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.220
Have you gone completely mad?

483
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.340
Cheese!

484
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.180
Cheese?

485
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:24.300
I do like a bit of Gorgonzola.

486
00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.500
Oh, dear.

487
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:35.660
- Perfect.
- Ma'am.

488
00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:38.140
- Now, let's see.
- Coming through!

489
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.660
The tombola's arrived.

490
00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.740
And the bouncy Tottington Hall.

491
00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:46.060
Splendid.

492
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:52.060
It's going to be such
a jolly competition tonight.

493
00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:53.580
I just know it.

494
00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.900
- Ya don't know nothin'.
- What?

495
00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:59.180
The beast has struck again.
That's what.

496
00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.620
That's right!

497
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.740
No, you're quite mistaken, Mrs. Mulch.

498
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.940
- The beast is in captivity.
- Oh, yeah?

499
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.580
Then just take a look
at my wife's brassicas.

500
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.460
- Ravaged in the night.
- But I don't understand.

501
00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.060
- Anti-Pesto told me...
- A pack of lies!

502
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.900
It's not safe to bring
our vegetables here.

503
00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.420
The show's off.

504
00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:25.140
But this is simply dreadful news.

505
00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:29.900
The Tottingtons have held
a giant vegetable competition

506
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:33.620
on this very night
for over 500 years.

507
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.500
That's right.

508
00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:40.620
Not even the Great Duck Plague
of '53 stopped it.

509
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.900
If only there were another way.

510
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.140
What ho!

511
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.380
It's Quartermaine.

512
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.420
Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother.

513
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.300
Didn't this bit used to...?

514
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:08.100
Now. Now, let's see.

515
00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.940
Where does this part go?

516
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.460
Oh, it's hopeless.

517
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.180
I'll never fix this flippin' machine.

518
00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.580
Me mind's just a rabbit-y mush.

519
00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.620
Oh, Gromit.

520
00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:36.860
I don't wanna be a giant rabbit!

521
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:44.940
The bounce is gone from his bungee.

522
00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:00.900
Hey, presto! Rabbit rehabilitation.

523
00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.340
But if I can't fix it...

524
00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.220
Cheddar.

525
00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.020
...maybe the other me can!

526
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.940
I'm inventing, mostly.

527
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.860
Look at me go! I'm a genius.

528
00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:20.100
Awake! I can't answer the door.
Not like this.

529
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.060
Charming. I'm Wallace.

530
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.420
I already am!

531
00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:26.940
Hutch!

532
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:31.660
Geronimo!

533
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.540
Wallace?

534
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.620
Hang on a mo'.

535
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.140
Wallace?

536
00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.900
Hello? I say.
Open this door at once.

537
00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.500
Totty.

538
00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.980
Lady Tottington, if you don't mind.

539
00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.980
I'm afraid I have some
rather bad news, Wallace.

540
00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:54.460
Thing is, well,

541
00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:58.980
you've rather let me down
with this beastly beast business.

542
00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.380
- I suppose I have.
- Yes.

543
00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.140
It's obvious to me
that you have absolutely no idea

544
00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.740
where this poor creature is.

545
00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:08.380
And I'm afraid
you've given me no option

546
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.820
but to let Victor
shoot the poor thing.

547
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.900
Shoot it?

548
00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:17.420
Yes. Wasn't an easy choice,

549
00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:19.740
but the veg competition
has to come first.

550
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.860
Besides, Victor's promised me
it won't suffer.

551
00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.100
It will be quick and painless.

552
00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.340
How thoughtful.

553
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:30.140
I cannot deny it was
a difficult decision for me.

554
00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.740
Because I've recently developed...

555
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.220
Hurry!

556
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.460
...feelings for you.

557
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.740
Feelings?
Oh, well, never mind, eh?

558
00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.340
- Ta-ra, then.
- Wait! Wallace.

559
00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.140
I haven't finished.
There's more that needs to be said.

560
00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:47.380
Well, I'll give you a tinkle, shall I?

561
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.860
Can’t we at least shake hands?
Part as friends?

562
00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.300
It's not very convenient
at the moment.

563
00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.140
Thanks for coming by.

564
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.940
Well, I... I...

565
00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:13.940
That's right, my lovely.

566
00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:18.340
You can say goodbye
to your fluffy lover-boy.

567
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:22.900
You gotta help me, Gromit!

568
00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.900
Hide me. Anything.

569
00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.900
Before it's too late!

570
00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:28.420
Lad!

571
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.140
Your Lordship.

572
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.380
Good night, Gromit.

573
00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.980
'Tis done.

574
00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:01.380
My poor sensitive child.

575
00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:06.540
Allow us all to share
in your moment of sorrow.

576
00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.140
Yeah!

577
00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:16.660
On with the show!

578
00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.660
What the...?

579
00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.700
Why you...

580
00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.100
Of course.

581
00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.300
The vegetable competition.

582
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.220
Your loyalty is moving.

583
00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:58.780
Sadly, you won't be.

584
00:57:58.900 --> 00:57:59.980
Come along, Phillip.

585
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.220
Everyone's been looking
forward to a good show.

586
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.860
Let's see they get one.

587
00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.780
- Hooray!
- Mr. Growbag.

588
00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:41.380
I... I have a hunch
this'll be a night to remember.

589
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:44.020
I just have a hunch.

590
00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.980
All right. All right.
If we must do this flipping veg show,

591
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.700
let's do it in an orderly
and law-abiding fashion.

592
00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.540
Cucumbers, give way to melons.

593
00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.700
Carrots, wait your turn!

594
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.180
- Aubergines...
- There's our bait, Phillip.

595
00:58:56.300 --> 00:59:00.740
All we have to do now is wait
for our fluffy friend to appear.

596
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:05.380
Look over here, everyone!
It's Victor!

597
00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.700
- He's here!
- Our hero.

598
00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.220
Please, sir, kiss my baby.

599
00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:11.460
- Another time, perhaps.
- Kiss my potato.

600
00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:14.180
- Not now.
- Kiss my artichoke.

601
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.580
- Look, just...
- Victor.

602
00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.180
Campanula!

603
00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:21.740
Victor, I have to know.
Did it suffer?

604
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:25.540
Of course not, my dear.
Not yet, anyway.

605
00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.180
- Victor?
- Oy, you.

606
00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.980
- Constable.
- Careful with them capsicums.

607
00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.860
Listen, I don't want to cause panic,
but the beast isn't actually dead yet.

608
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.700
- The beast isn't actually dead yet?
- What?

609
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.420
Oops.

610
00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:50.260
To the competition stand!

611
01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.140
Cracking toast, Gromit.

612
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.540
I'm just crackers about cheese.

613
01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.100
Monterey Jack.

614
01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.380
Smashing Wensleydale.

615
01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.980
Job well done, lad.

616
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.980
Quiet!

617
01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.460
Quiet!

618
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.740
Now, listen carefully.

619
01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:24.580
I've only got two...

620
01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:26.940
I've only got one gold bullet left.

621
01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.300
So leave this to me.

622
01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.620
Yes, all right, I admit
the beast is still at large.

623
01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.540
But the good news is your prize
vegetables are the perfect bait...

624
01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.540
Bait?

625
01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.780
...and will draw the creature
like a magnet.

626
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.340
- Keep still.
- My baby.

627
01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:45.100
- There, there, love. It'll be all...
- Don't even move a muscle.

628
01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.460
Mrs. Mulch! No!

629
01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.740
It's not getting my baby!

630
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.260
Lovely food. For rabbits, that is.

631
01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.220
- Come back!
- Come back!

632
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:10.980
Yes. Right on cue.

633
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.900
Come back!

634
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.260
Go away!

635
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.180
That's right. Come to Uncle Victor.

636
01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:29.620
It's coming for us!

637
01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.340
Bingo.

638
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.420
What the...?

639
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.060
Hurrah for Anti-Pesto!

640
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:51.620
- It's getting away!
- Get off, you stupid...

641
01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:52.780
No!

642
01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.500
Vicar, I need more gold bullets.

643
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.780
They don't come cheap, you know.

644
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.220
Victor? What are you doing?

645
01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.500
I need it, my sweet. Emergency.

646
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.780
- Victor, no! Please!
- Come, now, Campanula, let go.

647
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.620
But it's my Golden Carrot Award.

648
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.580
This is hardly the time, my darling.

649
01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.780
- Give it to me this instant!
- But Victor!

650
01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.340
Cheese, Gromit.

651
01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.220
The Golden Carrot belongs in the show!

652
01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.340
No, the Golden Carrot
belongs in the Were-Rabbit.

653
01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.180
Every man for himself!

654
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.860
Help! Help! Help me!

655
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:54.260
Put me down at once,
you great big hairy thing, you!

656
01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.020
Stop! Stop!

657
01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.660
Mob supplies!
Get your angry mob supplies here.

658
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.020
Put her down, you great ugly brute!

659
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.180
I'll bagsy the lucky rabbit's foot.

660
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.140
Help me, someone! Help me!

661
01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.820
Yes.

662
01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.620
No. No, no, no!

663
01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.380
Put me down! Put me down, you...

664
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.260
Whatever you are! Help!

665
01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.860
What is it?

666
01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.580
What are you staring at
with those beastly eyes?

667
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.260
Wallace.

668
01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.220
Oh, Wallace.

669
01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.860
What ever have you done to yourself?

670
01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.300
Well, don't you worry.
I'll protect you.

671
01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:05.140
Get your hairy mitts off
my future wife, you big brute.

672
01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.100
No! Victor!

673
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.500
You don't understand.
The hunt is off.

674
01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.860
It's... We made a terrible mistake.

675
01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.220
No. You commissioned me
to rid you of Pesto,

676
01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.660
and that's just
what I intend to do.

677
01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.580
Pesto?

678
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.460
Why, you knew
it was Wallace all along.

679
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.860
Oh, all right.

680
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.900
So what if it is that blithering idiot.

681
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.820
No one will ever believe you.

682
01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:41.620
And if I can't have your money,
I can still bag your bunny.

683
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.940
My eyes!

684
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.340
Run, rabbit, run!

685
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.340
I rather like your hair pinned back.

686
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.620
No, Victor, no! Stop! Please!

687
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.060
Victor!

688
01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:08.260
You can hop,
but you can't hide, Pesto.

689
01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.700
Beware the moon!

690
01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.620
Stupid interfering mutt.

691
01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.700
Stand back! There may be
a large rabbit dropping!

692
01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.740
Looks like the buck stops here.

693
01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:35.940
Eat karat, bunny boy!

694
01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.940
Potty poo!

695
01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:38.460
No one beats Victor Quartermaine!

696
01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.460
Is that so?

697
01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.860
Consider yourself dumped.

698
01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.300
He's in there!

699
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.940
- There he is!
- Surround him!

700
01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:00.540
There he is! Over there!

701
01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.180
Phillip, help me! Phillip!

702
01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.740
Do something.

703
01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:13.860
Destroy! Drive out the monstrosity!

704
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.540
Well, let's see how he likes it.

705
01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.980
Wallace?

706
01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:04.500
Oh, Gromit.

707
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.860
Well, at least now he's at peace.

708
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.340
The rabbit's gone.

709
01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:13.900
If only there were a way
to bring back Wallace.

710
01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.500
Lovely cheese, Gromit.

711
01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:32.940
Gromit?

712
01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.020
Don't forget the crackers.

713
01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.460
Cheese?

714
01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.900
Cheese!

715
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:54.060
It's me again. I'm back!

716
01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.980
Gromit! You clever mutt.

717
01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.820
Well done, old pal!

718
01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:07.900
- Totty!
- Wallace! You're...

719
01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.100
Thanks, lad.

720
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.300
Oh, look!

721
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.300
Well, I think
you deserve this, Gromit.

722
01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:25.100
For a brave and splendid melon.

723
01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:28.900
We've all got a lot to thank you for.

724
01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.300
Every dog has his day.

725
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:35.060
And thank you, Wallace.

726
01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:38.820
You've saved me
from a terrible marriage.

727
01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.940
All the same,

728
01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:44.740
it is going to be rather lonely
at Tottington Hall now.

729
01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.020
Unless...

730
01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.620
I have a little proposal
for you, Wallace.

731
01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.660
I'm so thrilled you agreed
to go through with this.

732
01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:04.420
My pleasure, Totty.

733
01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.460
One for the album, Gromit.

734
01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:17.420
I declare this bunny sanctuary
officially open.

735
01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.820
When you're ready, lad.

736
01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:26.300
Fire up the old BV6000.

737
01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.820
Oh, it's simply marvelous.

738
01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:43.100
My home, a safe haven
for all things fluffy.

739
01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.860
I do hope you'll still
come visit, Wallace.

740
01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:55.300
I'd rather got used to
having you around.

741
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:57.860
There'll always be a part of me

742
01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:00.700
here at Tottington Hall.

743
01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:04.140
Give it some more welly, lad.

744
01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:15.500
Cheese!
