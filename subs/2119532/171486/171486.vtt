00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,049
There was a time, a time before cable,

2
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,929
when the local anchorman
reigned supreme,

3
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:02,144
when people believed everything
they heard on TV.

4
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,315
This was an age when only men
were allowed to read the news.

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:12,488
And in San Diego, one anchorman
was more man than the rest.

6
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,657
His name was Ron Burgundy.

7
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,830
He was like a god
walking amongst mere mortals.

8
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,418
He had a voice
that could make a wolverine purr,

9
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,380
and suits so fine
they made Sinatra look like a hobo.

10
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,885
In other words,
Ron Burgundy was the balls.

11
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,809
I look good. I mean, really good.

12
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:47,231
Hey, everyone!
Come and see how good I look!

13
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,372
Ribs. I had ribs for lunch.
That's why I'm doing this.

14
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,792
How now brown cow?
How now brown cow?

15
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,461
How now brown cow?

16
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,672
How are you?
You look awfully nice tonight.

17
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,801
Maybe don't wear a bra next time.

18
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,722
No, I was talking to you. No, not her.

19
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,266
I don't know her name. What is it?

20
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,518
Lanolin?

21
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,397
Lanolin? Like sheep's wool?

22
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,692
Unique New York.

23
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,486
Unique New York.

24
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,990
I love scotch. I love scotch.
Scotchy-scotch-scotch.

25
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,743
Here it goes down. Down into my belly.

26
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,664
The arsonist has oddly shaped feet.

27
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,917
How much time? 30? 30 seconds?

28
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,670
- You are on.
- I'm on right now?

29
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,256
I don't believe you.

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,509
Ron!

31
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,594
Oh, come on. Audrey.

32
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,138
I look like hell.
I got bags under my eyes.

33
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,390
What's that?

34
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,267
If you were a man,
I'd punch you right in the mouth.

35
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,353
That's bush. Bush league.

36
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,940
The Human Torch
was denied a bank loan.

37
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,485
You hear me? Audrey, look at me!

38
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,029
I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry.

39
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,041
All right, we're on.

40
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,376
Ready, Phil.

41
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,795
We're on in five, four...

42
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,172
When the clock struck 6:00,

43
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:39,635
it meant one thing for Ron Burgundy
and his news team: Go time.

44
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,721
Channel 4 News,

45
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:46,392
with five-time Emmy
award-winning anchor Ron Burgundy.

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,728
Champ Kind, sports.

47
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,982
Brick Tamland, weather.

48
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,404
And your reporter
in the field, Brian Fantana.

49
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,077
It's Channel 4 News at 6:00.

50
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,082
Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy,

51
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,752
and this is what's happening
in your world tonight.

52
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,297
A La Jolla man clings to life
at a university hospital

53
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,884
after being viciously attacked
by a pack of wild dogs

54
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,510
in an abandoned pool.

55
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,514
Hey, everybody! Shut the hell up!
Ron Burgundy's on!

56
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,144
Authorities are still uncertain as to
why the man was loitering...

57
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,687
Ron Burgundy.

58
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,522
Oh, my gosh! She said her first words!

59
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,650
Right now it's 82 degrees in our fair city,

60
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,863
and compare that
to 48 degrees in the upper Northwest

61
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,741
and 38 degrees in the Middle East.

62
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,076
Off the coast of Tampa Bay yesterday,

63
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:51,040
one lucky cameraman happened
to catch an unusual aquatic daredevil.

64
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,919
What you're about to see
is a Channel 4 News exclusive.

65
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:59,548
His name is Nutty the Squirrel,
and he's three years old.

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,177
How about that?

67
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,596
That squirrel can water-ski.

68
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,393
- Man, that's hilarious.
- Yeah, that's good.

69
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,773
For all of us here at News Center 4,
I'm Ron Burgundy.

70
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,525
You stay classy, San Diego.

71
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,987
You stay classy, San Diego.

72
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,157
Listen up.
The ratings just came in for last month.

73
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,992
We are number one.

74
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,619
We just grabbed
every key demographic.

75
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,663
- Super-duper, gang!
- Yeah! Yeah!

76
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,082
Super-duper! That's nice!

77
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,500
Way to go! Neat-o, gang.

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,043
- Yes!
- Boy, Ed.

79
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,337
That is good news. I gotta be honest.

80
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,173
- Congrats, congrats.
- That is good news!

81
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,508
- All right!
- Stick around.

82
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,885
Make sure these guys
don't party too much.

83
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,429
- They don't really ever listen to me, Ed.
- Just get it done.

84
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,976
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I please have your attention?

85
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,105
I've just been handed an urgent
and horrifying news story.

86
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:01,443
I need all of you
to stop what you're doing and listen.

87
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,113
Cannonball!

88
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,870
Yes, these fellas
were a real news team.

89
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,582
Burgundy, of course,
was the foundation, the rock.

90
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,586
But each member brought their own
special something to the equation.

91
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,464
People call me the Bri-Man.
I'm the stylish one of the group.

92
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,175
I know what you're asking yourself,

93
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,429
and the answer is yes,
I have a nickname for my penis.

94
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,389
It's called the Octagon.

95
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,600
But I also nicknamed my testes.

96
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,268
My left one is James Westfall,

97
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,104
and my right one
is Dr Kenneth Noisewater.

98
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,733
You ladies play your cards right,
you might get to meet the whole gang.

99
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:45,863
Back booth there at Charlie Lancer's
every Friday night.

100
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,241
Champ here. I'm all about having fun.

101
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,036
You know,
get a couple of cocktails in me,

102
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,038
start a fire in someone's kitchen.

103
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,582
Maybe go to SeaWorld,
take my pants off.

104
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,584
Anyway, I've become kind of famous

105
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,670
for my signature catchphrase,
"Whammy!"

106
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:07,676
As in, "Gene Tenace at the plate
and whammy!"

107
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,345
Whammy!

108
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm Brick Tamland.

109
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:22,232
People seem to like me
because I am polite and I'm rarely late.

110
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:27,738
I like to eat ice cream,
and I really enjoy a nice pair of slacks.

111
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:32,701
Years later, a doctor will tell me
that I have an IQ of 48

112
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,538
and am what
some people call "mentally retarded. "

113
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,374
Hello!

114
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,251
- Marco!
- Polo!

115
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,171
- Brian.
- You having a good time?

116
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,882
- I'm having a great time.
- That makes two of us.

117
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,884
You've gotta meet this girl.

118
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,720
She used to be a Charger cheerleader,
but she broke her pelvis.

119
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,515
Sherri, meet Ron Burgundy.

120
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,225
- Hey, Ron.
- Hello.

121
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,229
I've got a big story for you.
And it's right here.

122
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,189
Well, hello.

123
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,776
You pointed to your boobies.

124
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,404
Oh, my God, you did!

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,616
- Ron Burgundy?
- Yes?

126
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,704
I have had a crush on you
since I was a little girl.

127
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,830
Let's go somewhere.

128
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,749
I'm telling you,
it don't get no better than this.

129
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,419
We've been coming
to the same party for 12 years,

130
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,005
and in no way is that depressing.

131
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,945
By the beard of Zeus!

132
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,784
Excuse me.

133
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,498
Ron, where you going?
What, are you crazy? Ron!

134
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,961
If you're coming down the baseline,
you gotta take home plate from me!

135
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,964
So there I go, head first, boom!

136
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,761
I've lost her.

137
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,531
Hello.

138
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,201
Hello.

139
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:42,456
Hope I'm not disturbing you,
but I saw you from across the party,

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,336
and I don't usually do this, but
I felt compelled to tell you something.

141
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,885
You have
an absolutely breathtaking heinie.

142
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,224
I mean, that thing is good.
I want to be friends with it.

143
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,771
Well, you certainly know
how to compliment a woman.

144
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,397
Now, if you'll excuse me.

145
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,650
Do you know who I am?

146
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,321
No, I can't say that I do.

147
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:20,244
I don't know how to put this,
but I'm kind of a big deal.

148
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,704
Really?

149
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,456
People know me.

150
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,416
I'm very happy for you.

151
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,335
I'm very important.

152
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,880
I have many leather-bound books,

153
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,844
and my apartment
smells of rich mahogany.

154
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,762
I mean...

155
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,722
That sounded stupid.

156
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,685
No, no, that's very exciting.

157
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,815
Listen, can I... Can I start over again?

158
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,733
Sure.

159
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,112
I wanna say something.
I'm gonna put it out there.

160
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,241
If you like it, you can take it.
If you don't, send it right back.

161
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,619
I wanna be on you.

162
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,666
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I...

163
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,339
I wanna be on you.

164
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,693
Baxter! Papa's home.

165
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,862
There he is. There's my little man.

166
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,489
You're okay?

167
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,909
Of course I met a lady tonight.

168
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,331
This one was different.
I have to be honest.

169
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,790
Quite different.

170
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,876
What?

171
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,253
I'm lonely? I'm not lonely!

172
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,632
I'm beloved by everyone in San Diego.

173
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,136
Wow.

174
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,225
You know
how to cut to the core of me, Baxter.

175
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,852
You're so wise.

176
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,815
You're like a miniature Buddha
covered in hair.

177
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,236
Come again?

178
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:21,240
You know I don't speak Spanish.
In English, please.

179
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,246
You pooped in the refrigerator?

180
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,916
And you ate a whole wheel of cheese?

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,920
How'd you do that?
I'm not even mad. That's amazing.

182
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,465
I forgive you.

183
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,635
What do you say we get you in your PJs
and hit the hay?

184
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,680
Bedtime. Okay, come on. Let's go.
Come on.

185
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:05,284
Oh, that was one crazy party.
I am hung over.

186
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,786
I woke up this morning

187
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,038
in some Japanese family's rec room,

188
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,376
and they would not stop screaming.

189
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,254
Yeah, I ate a big, red candle.

190
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,049
All right, guys. Let's focus up.

191
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,135
Morning, everyone.

192
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,887
Here are the stories
we're going to be chasing today.

193
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,347
It looks like Ling Wong,

194
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,684
the rare panda at the San Diego Zoo,
is pregnant.

195
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,810
This is a big one.

196
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,646
This could be
the big story of the summer.

197
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,941
Network is gonna be wanting
plenty of coverage.

198
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,609
And speaking of network,

199
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,779
word on the street is
they're looking for a new anchor.

200
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:46,074
- So, Ron...
- Network? Are they here?

201
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,166
A lot of you have been hearing
the affiliates complaining

202
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,085
about a lack of diversity
on the news team.

203
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,510
What in the hell's diversity?

204
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,013
Well, I could be wrong,

205
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,433
but I believe Diversity is an old,
old wooden ship

206
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,686
- that was used during the Civil War era.
- That's right.

207
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,979
I would be surprised

208
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,858
if the affiliates were concerned
about the lack of an old wooden ship,

209
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,526
but nice try.

210
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,988
Diversity means
that times are changing,

211
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,199
and with that in mind...

212
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,868
- Ron, are you paying attention?
- Nope.

213
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,080
- This concerns all of us.
- Okay.

214
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,206
Keeping that in mind,

215
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,335
I'd like to introduce the latest addition
to the KVWN News Team,

216
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:43,590
directly from WYPN
in Asheville, North Carolina,

217
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,718
Ms Veronica Corningstone.

218
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,182
Hello. Hello, everyone.

219
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,229
I just want you all to know
that I look forward to contributing

220
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,273
to this news station's
already sterling reputation.

221
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,404
I mean, come on, Ed! It's bull crap!

222
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,781
Don't get me wrong. I love the ladies.

223
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,451
They rev my engine,
but they don't belong in the newsroom!

224
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:17,124
It is anchorman, not anchorlady!
And that is a scientific fact!

225
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,670
I don't know what we're yelling about!

226
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,425
- Ron, what do you think?
- She... It's terrible!

227
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,344
She has beautiful eyes,
and her hair smells like cinnamon!

228
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,681
Loud noises!

229
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,477
All right, everyone relax.
She's not gonna take anyone's airtime.

230
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,939
I read somewhere
that their periods attract bears.

231
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,650
Bears can smell the menstruation.

232
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,571
Well, that's just great.
You hear that, Ed?

233
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,365
Bears. Now you're putting
the whole station in jeopardy.

234
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,288
I will say one thing for her, Ed,
she does have a nice, big old behind.

235
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,791
I'd like to put some barbecue sauce
on that butt

236
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,919
and just bite, bite, bite, bite,
munch, munch, munch!

237
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,629
Stop it! Oh, jeez.

238
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,843
Look at the full-moon butt!

239
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,679
Champ! Champ! Champ, Champ!

240
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,475
Mr Harken, I was just wondering

241
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,685
if you knew
when my office would be ready.

242
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,645
Well, that might take some time.

243
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,690
For now, why don't you just
grab a desk in the bullpen?

244
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,816
You can use my office!

245
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,985
Then afterwards
maybe we can go to lunch!

246
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,738
Lower your voice, Ron.

247
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,745
All right. Thank you, Mr Harken.
I'll go get my desk set up.

248
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,548
She is a saucy mama! I mean, I would...

249
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,511
Here we go again.

250
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,763
Every station, it's the same.

251
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,932
Women ask me how I put up with it.

252
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,809
Well, the truth is,
I don't really have a choice.

253
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,603
This is definitely a man's world.

254
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,356
But while they're laughing
and grab-assing,

255
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,485
I'm chasing down leads
and practising my non-regional diction.

256
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,404
Because the only way to win
is to be the best.

257
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,156
The very best.

258
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,204
Touchy situation.

259
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,374
I think the best thing to do
with this Corningstone,

260
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,335
to keep her in line, is bed her quick.

261
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,214
That behind is driving me loco!
I'm like a night wolf.

262
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,884
Guys, take it easy. Just take it easy!

263
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,471
- She's got feelings, too.
- Oh, my God!

264
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,973
Listen to Burgundy.

265
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,226
He's gone soft on us,
like some schoolboy bitch.

266
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,311
You sound like a gay.

267
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,901
Hey! Come on!
It's me, Papa Burgundy, all right?

268
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:53,572
As far as I'm concerned,
Corningstone's fair game.

269
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,616
Let the games begin!

270
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,037
There he is. There he is.

271
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,831
I'm very aroused.

272
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,170
What's this?

273
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,424
Well, well, well.

274
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,637
Ron Burgundy
and the Channel 4 News Team.

275
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,764
Hello, Wes Mantooth.

276
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,516
Hello, Evening News Team.

277
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,435
Nice clothes, gentlemen.

278
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,855
I didn't know the Salvation Army
was having a sale.

279
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,442
Am I right? Look at these guys.

280
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,281
Hey, where did you get those clothes?

281
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,116
At the toilet store?

282
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,331
What are you doing
on our station's turf, Burgundy?

283
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,541
You're about to get
a serious beat-down.

284
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:50,462
I will smash your face
into a car windshield

285
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,631
and then take your mother,
Dorothy Mantooth,

286
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,885
out for a nice seafood dinner
and never call her again!

287
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,763
Dorothy Mantooth is a saint!
You understand me?

288
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,432
- Dorothy Mantooth is a saint!
- Hey.

289
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,310
Leave the mothers out of this, all right?

290
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,731
It's unnecessary.

291
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,693
Besides, I'm sure Wes here

292
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:18,448
is just upset over finishing second
in the ratings again.

293
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,328
That's completely
uncalled for, Burgundy.

294
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,163
You know
those rating systems are flawed.

295
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,998
They don't take into account
houses that have

296
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,919
more than two television sets
and other things of that nature.

297
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,340
I guess I have to take you
at your word, Number Two.

298
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,931
You have a great day, fellas.
We'll see you around the bend.

299
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,852
Son of a bitch!

300
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,939
Excusez-moi, Numéro Two.

301
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,402
Hey, Burgundy.

302
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,196
You know those sample audiences
aren't big enough!

303
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,532
Stop hiding behind
those phoney numbers, Burgundy!

304
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,409
I'm coming after you!

305
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,620
I hate you, Ron Burgundy. I hate you!

306
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,708
You can't say one word?

307
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,710
Even the guy who can't think
says something!

308
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,962
You guys just stand there? Come on!

309
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,885
Right, but I think
my son is just going through a phase.

310
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,265
I have no idea where he would have
gotten a hold of German pornography.

311
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,225
But you and I are mature adults.

312
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,396
We've both seen our share
of pornographic materials.

313
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,564
Oh, you never have?

314
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,400
Of course you haven't,
how stupid of me. Neither have I.

315
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,569
I was just speaking in generalities.

316
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,865
I'll stop by the school a little later,
Sister Margaret. Bye.

317
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,076
Ed, she insisted on coming in.

318
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,703
Mr Harken, sir,

319
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,539
I will not have my first story
at this news station

320
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,083
be about a cat fashion show.

321
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,335
Miss Corningstone, ma'am,

322
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,796
you will do the stories
to which you are assigned.

323
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,300
Mr Harken, I am
a damn good journalist,

324
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,762
and this cat show thing
is grade-A baloney.

325
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,765
It is not baloney.
Now, go do your job, missy!

326
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,016
It is baloney!

327
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,067
Hey, Ron,
I'm gonna take a run at the new girl.

328
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,403
Let the games begin.

329
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,573
Champ, Champ,
we're not really gonna actually do that.

330
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,658
- We were just flapping our gums.
- Oh, yeah.

331
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,035
You kill me, Burgundy.

332
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,207
Let me just grab this. Sorry about that.

333
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,501
Whammy.

334
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,711
- Champ?
- Yeah.

335
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,464
You're trying to touch my breasts,
aren't you?

336
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,384
What can I say?
I like the way you're put together.

337
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,804
What do you say we go out on a date?

338
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,640
Have some chicken, maybe some sex.

339
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,725
You know, see what happens?

340
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,894
Let me get this over here.

341
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,982
Sorry. There it is.

342
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,363
I'll give this little cookie an hour
before we're doing the no-pants dance.

343
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,032
Time to musk up.

344
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,371
Wow. It never ceases to amaze me.

345
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,543
What cologne you gonna go with?
London Gentleman, or...

346
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,671
Wait. No, no, no. Hold on.

347
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,130
Blackbeard's Delight.

348
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,175
No, she gets a special cologne.

349
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:30,431
It's called Sex Panther, by Odeon.
It's illegal in nine countries.

350
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,394
Yep, it's made with bits of real panther.

351
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,771
- So you know it's good.
- It's quite pungent.

352
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,523
Oh, yeah.

353
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:43,945
It's a formidable scent.
It stings the nostrils.

354
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,947
- In a good way.
- Yep.

355
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,033
I'll be honest with you.
That smells like pure gasoline.

356
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,910
They've done studies, you know.

357
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,789
60% of the time, it works every time.

358
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,084
- That doesn't make sense.
- Well...

359
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,797
Let's go see
if we can make this little kitty purr.

360
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:11,014
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Got an invite I'd like to extend your way.

361
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,562
My God. What is that smell?

362
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,566
That's the smell of desire, milady.

363
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,735
God, no, it smells like...

364
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,071
Like a used diaper
filled with Indian food.

365
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:28,907
Excuse me.

366
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,409
Desire smells like that to some people.

367
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,330
What is that?
Smells like a turd covered in burnt hair!

368
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,169
It smells like Bigfoot's dick!

369
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,172
Oh, hell, that's rank!

370
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,469
What's that smell?

371
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,268
This is worse than the time
the raccoon got in the copier.

372
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,770
Yeah.

373
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,271
It's very distracting.

374
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,358
- When we get to the pet shop...
- Cough!

375
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,443
Look over here.

376
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,195
Excuse me, Veronica.

377
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,781
Yes, what is it, Brick?

378
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,785
I would like to extend to you
an invitation to the pants party.

379
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,454
Excuse me?

380
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,540
The party. The pants...

381
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,834
With the pants. Party with pants?

382
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,044
Brick, are you saying

383
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,172
that there's a party in your pants
and I'm invited?

384
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,465
That's it.

385
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,635
Did Brian tell you to say this, Brick?

386
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,804
No... Yes, he did.

387
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:37,016
Okay. No, I don't want to go
to a party in your pants.

388
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,977
Very well. Ian?

389
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,104
Would you like to go to a party
in my pants?

390
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,772
No, Brick.

391
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,899
All right. Let's go!

392
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,070
All right, now...

393
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,697
It's all right! I'm all right!

394
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,117
I'm telling you, she is a real ball-buster.

395
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,370
A real ice queen.

396
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,247
I just burned my tongue.

397
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,165
The only way to bag a classy lady

398
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,085
is to give her two tickets
to the gun show

399
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,508
and see if she likes the goods.

400
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:15,847
One thousand one, one thousand two.

401
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,143
- Mr Burgundy?
- One thousand three.

402
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,353
Helen said that you needed to see me?

403
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:26,482
Miss Corningstone.
I wasn't expecting company.

404
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,282
Just doing my workout.
Tuesday's arms and back.

405
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,994
- You asked me to come by, sir.
- Oh, did I?

406
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,495
Yes.

407
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,792
Oh, it's the deep burn! Oh, it's so deep.

408
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,380
I can barely lift my right arm
'cause I did so many.

409
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,717
I don't know if you heard me counting.
I did over 1,000.

410
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:58,014
You have your ubulus muscle
that connects to the upper dorsinus.

411
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,099
It's boring, but it's part of my life.

412
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,061
I'm just gonna grab this shirt,
if you don't mind.

413
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,439
Just watch out for the guns.
They'll get you.

414
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,149
You are pathetic.

415
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,945
This has to be the feeblest pickup
attempt that I have ever encountered.

416
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,075
I expected it from the rest of them,
Mr Burgundy, but not from you.

417
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:21,412
Wait a minute! I... Pickup attempt?
I'm offended.

418
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:25,750
I have little time to get to the gym,
so I have to sculpt my guns at the office.

419
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,753
Stop calling your arms "guns. "

420
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,339
Look.

421
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,344
My plan was to ask you
if I could squire you about town

422
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,429
as one professional
helping another professional,

423
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:42,183
because I know what it's like
to be lonely in a new city.

424
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,354
- Really?
- Yes.

425
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,482
But now I am too hurt.

426
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,819
And shocked and offended and hurt.

427
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,737
I could do that.

428
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,949
- Really?
- Well, yes.

429
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,994
As a journalist, I should get to know
the city that I'm covering.

430
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:05,373
- But this is not a date.
- No, of course not.

431
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,959
- Strictly professional.
- Wonderful.

432
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,253
Great.

433
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,590
So I pick you up... 8:00?

434
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,636
9:00.

435
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,681
Downstairs?

436
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,684
Mr Burgundy, you have
a massive erection.

437
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,018
Really?

438
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,814
Yes, I do.

439
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,402
I'm sorry, it's the... It's the pleats.

440
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:40,116
It's actually an optical illusion.
It's the pattern on the pants.

441
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,703
It's not flattering in the crotchal region.

442
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:48,875
I'm actually taking them back right now.
Taking them back to the pants store.

443
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,587
This is awkward.

444
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,089
I will see you later.

445
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,134
Yes.

446
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,095
I'm taking a...

447
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,765
Nothing to look at.

448
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,518
Don't act like you're not impressed.

449
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,729
Frame up two.

450
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,565
- Let's go to Brian Fantana live...
- Gimme a tighter one on two.

451
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,610
...with a Channel 4 News exclusive.
Brian?

452
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,905
Panda watch. The mood is tense.

453
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,657
I have been
on some serious, serious reports,

454
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,492
but nothing like this.

455
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,829
Ching... King is inside now.

456
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,498
I tried to get an interview,
but they said, "You can't.

457
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,084
"He's a live bear.
He will literally rip your face off. "

458
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,588
Hey! You're making me look stupid!

459
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,132
Get out here! Panda jerk!

460
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,427
Great story. Compelling and rich.

461
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,056
That's gonna do it for all of us
at Channel 4 News.

462
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,391
You stay classy, San Diego.

463
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,310
I'm Ron Burgundy?

464
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:54,398
Damn it! Who typed a question mark
on the teleprompter?

465
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,568
For the last time,
anything you put on that prompter,

466
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,153
Burgundy will read.

467
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:06,202
Oh, God, this is a mistake.
This is a mistake.

468
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:09,664
He's very cute. Very cute.
No, he's not. He's hairy.

469
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,667
There she is! Veronica!

470
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,086
My little china doll.

471
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,756
- I am full of it tonight.
- Oh, silly. Hi.

472
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:24,512
You look ravishing.
It truly is beauty and the beast.

473
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,723
I might add a handsome beast at that.

474
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,475
Are you ready for our rendezvous?

475
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,896
- It's not a date.
- No, strictly professional.

476
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,565
Doesn't mean we can't have fun.

477
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,192
- Shall we?
- Yes.

478
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,949
San Diego.

479
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,787
Drink it in. It always goes down smooth.

480
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,292
What a beautiful view, Mr Burgundy.

481
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,003
I know. I love this city. It's a...

482
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,130
It's a fact.

483
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,466
It's the greatest city
in the history of mankind.

484
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,971
Discovered by the Germans in 1904.

485
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,391
They named it San Diago,

486
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,228
which of course, in German, means
a whale's vagina.

487
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,942
No, there's no way that's correct.

488
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,365
I'm sorry. I was trying to impress you.

489
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,953
I don't know what it means.

490
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,706
I'll be honest. I don't think
anyone knows what it means any more.

491
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,502
Scholars maintain that the translation
was lost hundreds of years ago.

492
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,088
Doesn't it mean Saint Diego?

493
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,799
No. No.

494
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:47,011
No, that's what it means.

495
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,514
- Really.
- Well, agree to disagree.

496
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,355
May I take your order?

497
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,025
Yes, I am going to have
three fingers of Glenlivet

498
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,278
with a little bit of pepper,
and some cheese.

499
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:05,696
Very good.

500
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,032
A Manhattan,
and kick the vermouth in the side

501
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,784
with a pair of steel-toed boots.

502
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,827
- Certainly.
- Thank you, Scott.

503
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,038
Thank you.

504
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,374
Wow. Quite a drink order.

505
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,918
Well, when in Rome.

506
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,212
Yes?

507
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,381
Please, go on.

508
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,842
Do as the Romans do?

509
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:31,097
- It's an old expression.
- I've never heard of it.

510
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,932
It's wonderful, though.

511
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,725
Mr Burgundy.

512
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,103
- Tino! How are you?
- So good to see you.

513
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,938
You're looking fantastic.

514
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,023
Tino, Veronica.

515
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,234
Veronica. What a pretty girlfriend.

516
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,236
- Drinks are on Tino tonight.
- No, no, no.

517
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,905
We're work associates.
I work at the station.

518
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,991
- I'm a journalist.
- Oh, okay. This is a good guy.

519
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,244
Tino's the finest club owner in the city.

520
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,037
- My best friend, right?
- Yes.

521
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,666
Yes, we have a saying in my country
about people like him.

522
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,751
"The coyote of the desert

523
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,087
"always likes to eat
the heart of the young,

524
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,424
"where the blood drips down to children
for breakfast, lunch and dinner,

525
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,801
"only the ribs will be broken in two. "

526
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,094
- Tino.
- Okay.

527
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:15,099
Well, Mr Burgundy, we will be honoured
if you will play jazz flute for us.

528
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,017
- I can't.
- Please.

529
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,353
You play jazz flute?

530
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,688
I dabble.

531
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,316
Would everyone love to hear
Ron Burgundy play jazz flute?

532
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,528
- Get it going, Ronnie!
- Yes! Please.

533
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,280
You, on stage now.

534
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,615
Okay, I guess I can play a little ditty.

535
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,742
- Honestly, I'm...
- Come on.

536
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:37,329
- Give him a hand.
- I'm not prepared. Not at all.

537
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,207
- Yeah!
- This is a surprise, I'll tell you.

538
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,086
Guys, East Harlem Shakedown, E-flat?

539
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,796
Keep the cymbals splashy,

540
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,882
and, Jay,
let's take the bass line for a walk.

541
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,096
Hold on.

542
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,891
I'm not hearing it right. Hold on.

543
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,359
- We got it now. It's all right.
- Fire up, Ronnie!

544
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:13,574
Little Ham and Eggs coming at you.
Hope you got your griddles.

545
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:22,249
That's baby-making music,
that's what that is.

546
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,924
Let's go!

547
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,927
Hey, Aqualung!

548
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,607
Thank you.

549
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,193
Thank you!

550
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,869
- You were amazing.
- Thank you.

551
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,247
Where did you learn to play like that?

552
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:48,252
Well, jazz flute has always
been a small passion of mine.

553
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,672
So what other passions
do you have, Mr Burgundy?

554
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,342
Well, I have one great passion that...

555
00:34:56,303 --> 00:35:02,975
That lives deep within my loins,
like a flaming golden hawk.

556
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,272
To one day become a network anchor.

557
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:12,860
Well, believe it or not,
we share the same dream.

558
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,864
I too want to be a network anchor.

559
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,075
God, you are so beautiful.

560
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,832
We really should be going.

561
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,461
I swore that I would never
get involved with a co-worker.

562
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,547
Wait.

563
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,636
What if, just for tonight,
we weren't co-workers?

564
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,639
We were co-people?

565
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,016
I don't...

566
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,396
You be a woman. I'll be a man.

567
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,191
That's all.

568
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,905
You continue
to surprise me, Mr Burgundy.

569
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:22,137
I'm storming your castle
on my steed, milady.

570
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,982
Wait, stop. Stop talking like that.

571
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,777
- I can't understand you.
- Sorry.

572
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,950
Take me to Pleasure Town!

573
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,119
Oh, we're going there!

574
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,217
I frigging love you!

575
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,469
I frigging love you back!

576
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,186
Look! The most glorious rainbow ever!

577
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,855
Do me on it!

578
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,208
Well done, sir.

579
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:41,049
Tip of the cap to you
as well, Miss Corningstone.

580
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,934
I'm having very strong feelings
for you, Mr Burgundy.

581
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,480
But it's very important to me
that I be viewed as a professional.

582
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,231
Right.

583
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:58,275
When in Rome.

584
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Yeah.

585
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,948
That expression doesn't really apply
to what I'm talking about.

586
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,035
What I was saying.

587
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,912
I still don't quite understand
what it means.

588
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,581
Oh, no. You'll find it.

589
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,587
No, I was saying that,
if we continue seeing each other,

590
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:22,508
that we should keep it relatively quiet
around the station.

591
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:27,137
Absolutely, my wild love tigress.

592
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,185
Tasteful discretion
is the name of the game.

593
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:43,403
Veronica Corningstone and I had sex,
and now we are in love!

594
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,698
Did I say that loud?

595
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,200
Yeah, you pretty much yelled it.

596
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:52,246
Well, I can't help it. It's fantastic!

597
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:55,833
- What's it like, Ron?
- The intimate times?

598
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,918
Outta sight, my man!

599
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,839
No. The other thing.

600
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,718
- Love.
- Yeah. What is that?

601
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,139
Well, it's tough to explain.

602
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,768
- I think I was in love once.
- Really, what was her name?

603
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,895
I don't remember.

604
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,439
That's not a good start, but keep going.

605
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:24,069
She was Brazilian.
Or Chinese, or something weird.

606
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:28,615
I met her in the bathroom of a Kmart,
and we made out for hours.

607
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,286
Then we parted ways,
never to see each other again.

608
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,540
- I'm pretty sure that's not love.
- Damn it!

609
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,584
I love

610
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,336
carpet.

611
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,133
I love desk.

612
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:50,137
Are you just looking at things in the
office and saying you love them?

613
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,639
I love lamp.

614
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,685
Do you really love the lamp,
or are you saying it because you saw it?

615
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,479
I love lamp! I love lamp.

616
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,899
You really want to know what love is?

617
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,901
- Yeah.
- Yes, tell us.

618
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,320
More than anything in the world.

619
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,948
Well, it's really quite simple.

620
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,577
It's kind of like...

621
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,208
You guys have it, I think.

622
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,340
I don't know, Ron.
That sounds kind of crazy.

623
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,759
Sounds like
you have mental problems, man.

624
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,762
- Yeah, you got mental problems, man.
- Yeah, he really does.

625
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,013
Man.

626
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,685
- Wanna make a phone call.
- Freshen this up.

627
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,905
Oh, look out.
Next up, it's Whiskerus Maximus.

628
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,991
He's ready to do battle in the arena

629
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,910
against the tiniest lion
you've ever imagined.

630
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,956
I'm getting some great stuff,
Miss Corningstone.

631
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,457
Shut up.

632
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,293
I hate cats.

633
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:48,422
Let's just do my sign-off
and get out of here.

634
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,508
It was quite a show down here
at the Pet Shack.

635
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:56,471
Just for today,
fashion curiosity did not kill the cat.

636
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,558
I'm Veronica Corningstone
for Channel 4 News.

637
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,353
That was our newest reporter,
Veronica Corningstone.

638
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,063
She's really great.

639
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,899
I'd also like to share with you
that we are currently dating

640
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:11,111
and that she is quite a handful
in the bedroom.

641
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,282
That's gonna do it
for all of us here at 6:00.

642
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,035
For the Channel 4 News Team,
I'm Ron Burgundy.

643
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,995
You stay classy, San Diego.

644
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,414
All clear.

645
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,003
I might be in trouble on that one.

646
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:31,882
I can't believe that you said
that we were dating on the air.

647
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,802
That is good fondue.

648
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,222
Don't you get it, Ron?
I wanna be an anchor.

649
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,390
That is never gonna happen

650
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:43,518
if everyone in San Diego
thinks that I'm your bimbo gal pal.

651
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:48,231
I don't know what to say.
I just... I got excited.

652
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:52,402
I just wanted to shout it
from on top of a mountain.

653
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:56,823
But I didn't have a mountain.
I had a newsroom and a camera.

654
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,659
Look. I report the news.
That's what I do.

655
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,663
And today's top story,
in Ron Burgundy's world,

656
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,832
read something like this,

657
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,293
I love Veronica Corningstone.

658
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,007
Oh, Ron.

659
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,764
This is nice, gang, sitting here.

660
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,934
- Oh, yeah.
- Brown bagging it.

661
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,143
The team pancake breakfast

662
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,354
is tomorrow morning at 9:00
instead of 8:00.

663
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:31,316
Almost forgot.
I won't be able to make it, fellas.

664
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,529
Veronica and I are trying
this new fad called jogging.

665
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,157
I believe it's jogging or yogging.
It might be a soft "J."

666
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,450
I'm not sure,

667
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,870
but apparently you just run
for an extended period of time.

668
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,790
- It's supposed to be wild.
- So Ron's not coming?

669
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,125
No, Ron's coming.

670
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:51,461
It's the pancake breakfast.
We do it every month.

671
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,505
I realise that.

672
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,300
Sometimes you gotta look yourself in
the mirror and say, "When in Rome. "

673
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,136
The bottom line is,

674
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,055
you've been spending a lot of time
with this lady.

675
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:05,892
You're a member
of the Channel 4 News Team.

676
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,854
- That's a given.
- We need you.

677
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,232
Hell, I need you.

678
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,320
I'm a mess without you.
I miss you so damn much.

679
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,116
I miss being with you.

680
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,828
I miss being near you.
I miss your laugh.

681
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,546
I miss your scent. I miss your musk.

682
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,926
When this all gets sorted out,

683
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,388
I think you and me should get
an apartment together.

684
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,893
Just take it easy, Champ.

685
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,270
Why don't you stop talking for a while?

686
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,523
Maybe sit the next couple of plays out.
You know what I mean?

687
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:57,944
Yeah, I'm gonna quit saying things
when they crop up in the old skull, huh?

688
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,615
See what it's like when you're not here?

689
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,742
You're our leader.
Look what you're doing to the group.

690
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:07,037
Champ's been a mess.
Brick can't sleep at night.

691
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,040
Here's the thing, I don't trust this chick.

692
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,168
We need you around,
and she is just using you.

693
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,921
Everyone, just relax. All right?

694
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,424
Believe me, if there's one thing
Ron Burgundy knows, it's women.

695
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,259
I don't know, Ron.

696
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,221
Guess what? I do.

697
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,680
I know that one day,

698
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:30,060
Veronica and I are gonna get married
on top of a mountain.

699
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,396
And there's going to be flutes playing

700
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:37,651
and trombones and flowers
and garlands of fresh herbs.

701
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:42,405
And we will dance till the sun rises.

702
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,283
And then our children
will form a family band.

703
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:49,120
And we will tour the countryside,
and you won't be invited!

704
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,669
I'm telling you, this lady has really
crawled into Ron's head.

705
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:02,133
Good. Good one!

706
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:06,680
Okay. I understand.
You have a nice day, sir. Bye.

707
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,433
I could come back later, Mr Harken.

708
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,769
No, no, no. It's just parent stuff.

709
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:17,983
It seems that our youngest, Chris,
was on something called "acid"

710
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,360
and was firing a bow and arrow
into a crowd.

711
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,698
- You know how kids are.
- Right.

712
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,409
Anyhoo, what can I do you for?

713
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:31,746
Well, Mr Harken, I feel like
I have proven myself as a journalist

714
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:35,542
and that I deserve the opportunity
to take on more challenging stories.

715
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,837
Well, ask and you shall receive.

716
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,797
Yes, this just came across my desk.

717
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:44,342
Here is a story of a 103-year-old woman
out in Chula Vista

718
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:47,512
who claims to have a recipe
for the world's greatest meatloaf.

719
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,723
Now that's a hot lead.

720
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:56,354
It was very hard for Veronica.
But she was a pro and hung tough.

721
00:46:56,439 --> 00:47:01,860
But soon, with a simple act of littering,
everyone's life would change forever.

722
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,368
Baxter, you are my little gentleman

723
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,620
I'll take you to foggy London Town

724
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:13,955
Because you are what

725
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,750
My little gentleman

726
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,836
This burrito is delicious, but it is filling.

727
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,758
Antony and Cleopatra!

728
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,268
Goddamn son of...

729
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,270
What the hell, bro?

730
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,606
Hello, neighbour.

731
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,192
Did you just throw
a burrito out your window?

732
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,318
I believe I did.

733
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,945
Are you high or something?
Did you see what happened?

734
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,032
I did. That was a terrific little spill.
That's quite a raspberry.

735
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,826
That's my chopper
you just thrashed, Broseph.

736
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:55,372
Easy, compadre.
I'm your friend out here, all right?

737
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,833
I want you to fix my chopper
before I stomp your goofy ass!

738
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,210
If you want to throw down, fine.

739
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,463
I've got Jack Johnson and Tom O'Leary
waiting for you.

740
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,549
You destroyed the only thing I love.

741
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:10,387
All right? There it is. What do you love?

742
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:14,224
I love poetry. And a glass of scotch.

743
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,018
And, of course, my friend Baxter here.

744
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,854
Well, guess what.
Now this is happening.

745
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,982
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What are you doing?

746
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,822
That's how I roll.

747
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,824
Baxter!

748
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:33,910
No!

749
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,834
- Where the hell is he?
- He'll be here.

750
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,295
- I thought he was Mr Dependable.
- It's not like Ron.

751
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,882
I'd put Brick on, but unless he's
tracking a storm front, he's useless.

752
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,509
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Hello.

753
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,263
Just want you to know if Ron does not
show up, I am ready to go on.

754
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,182
You and I have had this discussion
a million times.

755
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,600
There's never been a woman anchor.

756
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:01,354
Mr Harken, this city needs its news.

757
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,150
You're gonna deprive them of that
because I have breasts?

758
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,943
Exquisite breasts?

759
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:11,030
I am gonna go on,
and if you want to stop me, bring it on.

760
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,324
Because I am good at three things,

761
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,119
fighting, screwing
and reading the news.

762
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,873
I've already done one of those today,
so what's the other one gonna be?

763
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,502
Screwing?

764
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:29,966
I will be in makeup.

765
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,429
Jesus, she's terrifying!

766
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,222
Fantana.

767
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,645
- Ron, are you okay?
- The man punted Baxter!

768
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,483
Calm down. Breathe, Ron, breathe.

769
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:50,487
- The man that loved the motorcycle!
- What did the bad man do?

770
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:54,991
The motorcycle on the bridge!
I hit him with a burrito!

771
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,075
- Ron!
- He took him!

772
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,913
He took him with his foot
and he kicked him!

773
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,247
That's what he did!

774
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,373
Someone punted him?

775
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:06,669
No, wait. Wait. Let me say something.
Let me say something.

776
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,133
What?

777
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,599
I didn't understand one word you said.

778
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,643
Ron, are you okay? Ron?

779
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,568
Ron. Where are you?

780
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:34,197
I'm in a glass case of emotion!

781
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:38,868
He's gonna put Corningstone on.
He's gonna put Corningstone on!

782
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,039
I've got to do the news!

783
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,304
You're not Ron.

784
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,059
We're on in 10. Good luck, lady.

785
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,811
Ready the announce.

786
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,234
- Power.
- Roll in.

787
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,319
Power. Power.

788
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:21,494
One slip, and you're gone.

789
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,745
Whammy.

790
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,291
And your reporter
in the field, Brian Fantana.

791
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,252
It's Channel 4 News at 6:00.

792
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,756
Good evening.
Ron Burgundy is off tonight.

793
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,218
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

794
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,470
Tonight's top story...

795
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,931
- Okay, we're off and running.
- Three armed men wearing ski masks

796
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:45,268
made off with over $20,000
from an area bank

797
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,145
in a daring early morning robbery.

798
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,151
Hey!

799
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,863
And the winner of the frog-leaping
contest was Hoppy,

800
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,949
with a jump of 7 feet, 10 inches.

801
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:06,623
I used to date a guy named Hoppy down
in Alabama. He was quite a jumper, too.

802
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,126
That will do it for us at 6:00.

803
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:15,214
From all of us here at Channel 4 News,
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

804
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,134
And thanks for stopping by, San Diego.

805
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,802
All clear!

806
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:22,472
Yes! Yes!

807
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,475
Lady! Lady!

808
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,810
Not bad, Miss Corningstone.
Not bad at all.

809
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,521
Thank you, Mr Harken. That felt good.

810
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,566
- That felt really good.
- I liked your sign-off line, too.

811
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,569
You did? It just came through me.
It was so organic.

812
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,197
Thank you.

813
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,078
Oh, Ron! Ron! Ron, darling!
I'm so glad you're all right. Oh, God.

814
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,996
I have something magnificent to tell you.

815
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:49,207
I'm here. We can do the news now.

816
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,960
It's all right, everyone!
We can do the news. Hold on.

817
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,254
Why are we all standing around?
Let's go!

818
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,383
Ron, we did it. Veronica filled in for you.

819
00:52:58,926 --> 00:52:59,926
What?

820
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,844
Sweetheart,
we were so worried about you,

821
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,180
and we waited
as long as we could, but...

822
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:08,476
Darling, I did the news, and I nailed it.
I nailed it.

823
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,312
Wait, wait! Veronica, please,

824
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:15,858
tell me this is some kind of sick,
tasteless joke.

825
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,236
You weren't here.
Why are you being this way?

826
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,782
Why can't you be proud of me
as a peer and as my gentleman lover?

827
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:24,575
Oh, jeez.

828
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,662
I can't believe you did this to me!

829
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,330
You read my news!

830
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:34,210
I told you that I wanted to be an anchor.
I told you that.

831
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,381
I thought you were kidding!
I thought it was a joke!

832
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,883
I even wrote it down in my diary!

833
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:44,220
"Veronica had a very funny joke today. "

834
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:48,558
- I laughed at it later that night!
- I can't believe that I cared for you.

835
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,601
Get out! Just go!

836
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:53,438
We are through! Through!

837
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:56,274
Because of your actions,
you scorpion woman!

838
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:59,402
You have broken my heart,
Mr Burgundy.

839
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,320
You have broken my heart.

840
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:09,996
From there on out,
things just got worse for Ron Burgundy.

841
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,748
Corningstone was a star,

842
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:15,918
and everything started to move
awfully fast after her big break.

843
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,670
Where's Ian? Ian!

844
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,131
All right, I got a call from network.

845
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:25,636
It looks like our broadcast last night
received a two-point ratings boost,

846
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:30,933
and the decision has been passed down
to make Veronica our co-anchor.

847
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:33,102
- What?
- No. No!

848
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,021
No!

849
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,898
- No!
- No!

850
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,357
- No!
- This is wonderful.

851
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,903
Ed, come here, you big silly man.
You big silly man.

852
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,906
- We did it.
- What is this, amateur hour?

853
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,912
- That's great.
- Thank you.

854
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,205
Damn it!

855
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:23,820
What Brian didn't tell you was
that those were not real pirates.

856
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,280
- They looked convincing, though.
- Oh, yes.

857
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:30,451
Well, for all of us here
at Channel 4 News, I'm Ron Burgundy.

858
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,453
You stay classy, San Diego.

859
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,580
And thanks for stopping by.

860
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,833
But mainly stay classy.

861
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:39,168
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Stay classy, I'm Ron Burgundy.

862
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,254
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Stay classy.

863
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,880
Ron Burgundy.

864
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,637
You are a real hooker,
and I'm gonna slap you in public.

865
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:58,187
You have man boobs.

866
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,731
You've got a dirty, whorish mouth.

867
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:09,156
I'm gonna punch you in the ovary.
A straight shot.

868
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,200
Right to the baby-maker.

869
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:14,954
Jazz flute is for little fairy boys.

870
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,914
Okay, you know what?
That's uncalled for.

871
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,083
I can't work with this woman.
It's terrible.

872
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,130
It's ringing.

873
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,757
Veronica Corningstone.

874
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:31,012
Hello, Veronica, this is Mike Rithjin
from the network.

875
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:34,223
You've just been promoted.
You're gonna need to move to Moscow.

876
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,100
Start cleaning up your desk.

877
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,394
See you in the morning.
We'll pick you up in a van.

878
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,479
What did you say your name was?

879
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,607
Mike Rithnithin. It's not important.

880
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:46,527
Start cleaning your desk,
and we'll pick you up in the morning.

881
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,571
Tell her she might want to get a coat.

882
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,741
Hold on. Veronica? What was it?

883
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,992
Tell her to get a coat.

884
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,578
Also, I don't know if you know Moscow.
It's pretty cold.

885
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,622
You might want to buy a coat.

886
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,374
Are you and Champ having
a good time, Ron?

887
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:01,584
Are we what?

888
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,461
I can see you, Ron.

889
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,089
- What?
- I can see you.

890
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,426
Okay. Bye-bye.

891
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,345
- What happened?
- She knew it was me.

892
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,726
You're watching Channel 4 News

893
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,104
with five-time Emmy award-winning
anchor Ron Burgundy

894
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,607
and Tits McGee.

895
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,610
Good evening, San Diego.
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

896
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,820
Tits McGee is on vacation.

897
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,368
And I'm Tits... I'm Ron Burgundy.

898
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,207
- Veronica Corningstone.
- This is your doctor.

899
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,669
I have your pregnancy report here,
and guess what.

900
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:47,505
You got knocked up.
You should probably get out of news.

901
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,257
- Who is this?
- This is Dr Chim.

902
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:53,594
- Dr Chim Richalds.
- Ron, is this you?

903
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,598
I'm a professional doctor.
You saw me. You don't remember.

904
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:01,894
You should move.

905
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,813
- Get out of the business.
- This is pathetic.

906
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,273
You're pathetic.

907
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:07,733
What'd she say?

908
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,944
She... I don't... I think she bought it.

909
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,531
She's looking this way.

910
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:15,992
Here she comes.

911
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,123
I'll tell you what, it's just not working.

912
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,001
She's making us look
like a bunch of fools.

913
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,253
Helen, where's the party?

914
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,841
Children, grow up.

915
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:34,677
Son of a bee sting.

916
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,595
She's turning the entire office
against us.

917
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,266
- This is grim. Real grim.
- What are we gonna do?

918
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,767
There's only one thing a man can do

919
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:46,022
when he's suffering
from a spiritual and existential funk.

920
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,065
Go to the zoo, flip off the monkeys?

921
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,484
No. Buy new suits.

922
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:06,125
Where's the suit store?
We've been walking for 45 minutes.

923
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,085
Brick, I thought you said
this was a shortcut.

924
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,587
Fantastic.

925
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,214
- Is it a shortcut or not?
- Okay.

926
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,092
Jeez.

927
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,264
Hey.

928
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,434
Here comes trouble.

929
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,732
Burgundy and the ladies
went out for a stroll, huh?

930
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,235
You boys walking around
and talking things through?

931
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,862
Keep a tight perimeter.

932
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,075
Yes, siree.

933
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,535
Well, well, well.

934
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:46,457
Ron Burgundy
and the Channel 4 News Team.

935
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,251
Where's your mommy?

936
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,337
You back off, Evening News Team.

937
00:59:56,134 --> 01:00:00,679
You know, I understand that
they had to bring a female in.

938
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,849
Change your diapers.

939
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,185
Wipe the dribble away
from your bubbling lips.

940
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,106
Rub Vaseline all over your heinie

941
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:14,401
and tell you that it's special
and different from everyone else's.

942
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,238
He said "heinie"!

943
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,825
- Brick, get back over here!
- Heinie!

944
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,410
Does she tuck you in, Ronnie?

945
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:27,748
Give you a little kiss on your forehead?
Tell you everything's gonna be okay?

946
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:33,045
I've had enough of you, Mantooth.
This is gonna end right here, right now.

947
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,799
- Let's dance, dickweed.
- You wanna dance, Ronnie?

948
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,388
I wanna polka.

949
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,065
Come get a taste.

950
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:00,906
- Brick, where'd you get a hand grenade?
- I don't know.

951
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,785
All right. Let's do this!

952
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,247
Hey!

953
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,960
If you're gonna have a fight,

954
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,921
then don't forget
Channel 2 News with me,

955
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,798
lead anchor Frank Vitchard.

956
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,177
You dirtbags have been in third place
for five years.

957
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:25,097
Yeah?
Well, you're about to be in dead place.

958
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,857
Not so fast, you ingrates!

959
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:39,403
Public News Team is taking a break
from its pledge drive to kick some ass.

960
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,406
No commercials! No mercy!

961
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,256
Spanish Language News is here.

962
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:00,841
Tonight's top story,

963
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:04,136
the sewers run red
with Burgundy's blood.

964
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:15,731
Well, looks like we got ourselves
a bilingual bloodfest.

965
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:26,367
Now, before we do this,
let's go over the ground rules.

966
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,163
Rule number one,

967
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,958
no touching of the hair or face.

968
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,293
Of course.

969
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,630
And that's it! Now let's do this!

970
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,182
Begin!

971
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,931
I'm gonna straight-up murder your ass!

972
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,058
- Blade!
- Here you go, mate!

973
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,730
God! I did not see that coming!

974
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:47,156
- Now I'll be number one.
- No, you won't!

975
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,496
It's the police! It's the police!

976
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:08,010
Boy, that escalated quickly.

977
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,472
I mean, that really got out of hand fast.

978
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,099
- It jumped up a notch.
- It did, didn't it?

979
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,435
Yeah, I stabbed a man in the heart.

980
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:20,189
I saw that. Brick killed a guy.

981
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,857
- Did you throw a trident?
- Yeah.

982
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,903
There were horses and a man on fire
and I killed a guy with a trident.

983
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,030
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

984
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,200
Find yourself a safe house
or a relative close by.

985
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:35,037
Lay low for a while, because
you're probably wanted for murder.

986
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:38,374
I'm proud of you fellas.
You kept your head on a swivel.

987
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,543
That's what you gotta do
when you're in a vicious cockfight.

988
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:44,213
Can you believe Mantooth and
the Channel 9 Evening News Team?

989
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,382
"Where's your mommy?
Someone's gotta change your diapers. "

990
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:49,218
This Corningstone business
is really hurting our rep.

991
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,303
I know exactly what you mean, Brian.

992
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,056
Every newsman in this city's
laughing at us.

993
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:58,018
- And I don't like it.
- I don't like the put-downs.

994
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:02,147
We're gonna do something about it.
It is time to put an end to this!

995
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,858
Last time I looked in the dictionary,
my name's Ron Burgundy.

996
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:06,402
- What's your name?
- Brian Fantana.

997
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,195
- Champ Kind.
- Brian Fantana.

998
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,571
No, you're Brick.

999
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,073
- Brian.
- I'm Brian.

1000
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:15,202
And I've shown you, old man!

1001
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,789
Garth, I need to look at these tapes
for a potential lead.

1002
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:19,957
Ron's using the machine

1003
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:23,043
to play his local Emmy acceptance
speech from last year.

1004
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:25,379
I tried to ask her out on a date.

1005
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:28,465
Turn the music off! I'm still talking!

1006
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,759
- This is ridiculous!
- I don't remember doing it.

1007
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:34,054
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

1008
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,349
I need this machine
so I can watch a tape for a story.

1009
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:41,437
I'm using the tape.
I'm showing Jeffrey my Emmy tape.

1010
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:42,771
We are watching history.

1011
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:47,818
Mr Burgundy, I'm a professional,
and I would like to be able to do my job.

1012
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,113
Big deal! I am very professional!

1013
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,490
Mr Burgundy, you are acting like a baby.

1014
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:57,119
I'm not a baby, I am a man.
I am an anchorman!

1015
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,289
You are not a man.
You are a big fat joke!

1016
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,207
I'm a man who discovered the wheel

1017
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,377
and built the Eiffel Tower
out of metal and brawn.

1018
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,212
That's what kind of man I am.

1019
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:10,215
You're just a woman with a small brain.

1020
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,719
With a brain a third the size of us.
It's science.

1021
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,763
I will have you know
that I have more talent

1022
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:21,727
and more intelligence in my little finger
than you do in your entire body, sir!

1023
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,229
You are a smelly pirate hooker!

1024
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,565
You look like a blueberry.

1025
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,651
Why don't you go back to your home
on Whore Island?

1026
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:33,238
Well, you have bad hair.

1027
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,284
What did you say?

1028
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:43,332
I said your hair looks stupid.

1029
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:53,550
- Let them work it out!
- It's between the two of them!

1030
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,649
They're just talking. Just talking.

1031
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,443
- I hate you!
- I hate you more!

1032
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,292
Shut up! Shut up!

1033
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:34,633
All right, stop!
Stop what you're doing right now!

1034
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,678
I will not have my newsroom be divided.

1035
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,557
Knights of Columbus, that hurts!

1036
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,895
I was like, "Who is that guy?"

1037
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:52,901
I just can't believe what Ron did to you.

1038
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:56,113
- It is so awful.
- Yes.

1039
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:01,868
Have you ever thought about
fighting fire with fire?

1040
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,164
What do you mean?

1041
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:10,544
I have some information
that you can choose to use or not use.

1042
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,337
Up to you.

1043
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:17,426
Ron Burgundy will read anything
that is put on that teleprompter.

1044
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:21,388
And when I say anything,
I mean anything.

1045
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:31,690
Arnold, cue one.

1046
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,859
After the Fotomat was destroyed,

1047
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,778
the bear scampered back
into the woods.

1048
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:40,282
Apparently he wasn't too happy
with his colour prints.

1049
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:46,246
From the entire Channel 4 News Team,
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

1050
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:48,206
And I'm Ron Burgundy.

1051
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,542
Go fuck yourself, San Diego.

1052
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,967
What in the name...

1053
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,135
No!

1054
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:05,057
Nobody talks about my city that way!
Ron Burgundy's ass is grass!

1055
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,979
Nice work, everyone. Sharp broadcast.

1056
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:13,482
Really good.
Everyone on the floor as well.

1057
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:16,151
Really a lot of hustle. I liked it.

1058
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,487
Dump out! Dump out!

1059
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:20,906
Hello, Edward.

1060
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,408
- Ron, I've got to fire you.
- I've got to fire you.

1061
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,578
You're fired, Ed.

1062
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,664
Do you even know what you just said?

1063
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:33,960
- Great Odin's raven!
- Are you happy, Ron?

1064
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,422
Veronica.
She put that in the teleprompter.

1065
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:41,343
You're probably right,
but this is bad, Ron. Real bad.

1066
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,805
My hands are tied. I... I gotta fire you.

1067
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:48,016
Ed, let's hold on. Let's count to 10.

1068
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,812
That's a rash decision.
Is this about something else?

1069
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:55,857
Ed, there's 300
very angry San Diegoites.

1070
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:58,443
San Diego-ins. San Diego-ans.

1071
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,821
- San Diegons.
- San Diegans.

1072
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,031
San Diegans out in front of the station.

1073
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:06,410
- They want Ron's blood.
- They want to hurt you.

1074
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,912
Why did you say that? Why?

1075
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,873
Why, Ron? Why?

1076
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,627
- You're my hero, Ron.
- Garth, I...

1077
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:19,506
And you come out
with stink like that, poop!

1078
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:24,886
You poop mouth!
Get all the poop out of your mouth!

1079
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:28,724
If I were to give you money out of my
wallet, would that ease the pain?

1080
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,893
I hate you, Ron Burgundy! I hate you!

1081
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,651
Ron? Ron!

1082
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:43,155
I can't believe you did this to me!
Are you happy?

1083
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,781
No, Ron, I'm not!

1084
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,200
I have nothing left! Nothing!

1085
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,119
I've been reduced to rubble!

1086
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:50,287
Ron?

1087
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,206
Come on, man, these people are about
to tear you apart.

1088
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,083
- I have nothing!
- Move, please!

1089
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,211
No! No!

1090
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:13,518
Mr Burgundy, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

1091
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,354
- Please, I...
- You're an awful man!

1092
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:20,567
You are truly a disappointment
to us all, Mr Burgundy!

1093
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:25,697
Bob Dylan once wrote,
The Times They Are A-Changin'.

1094
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,784
Ron Burgundy
had never heard that song.

1095
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,578
So when he fell, he fell hard.

1096
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:39,920
It's Channel 4 News at 6:00!

1097
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:44,299
Good evening, San Diego.
I'm lead anchor Veronica Corningstone.

1098
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:45,926
Tonight's top story,

1099
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:50,806
an ultrasound of Ling Wong,
the most famous panda in the world,

1100
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,225
shows that her baby is doing quite well.

1101
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,434
No!

1102
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,944
Ron Burgundy, stay classy.

1103
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,196
Hello, this is Ron.

1104
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,906
Hello.

1105
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,408
Who's there? I'm talking. Hello.

1106
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,452
Who is this?

1107
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:16,331
Baxter, is that you? Baxter!

1108
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,917
Bark twice if you're in Milwaukee.

1109
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,211
Is this Wilt Chamberlain?

1110
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,131
Have the courage
to say something. Hello!

1111
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,051
Hello!

1112
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,352
Hey, you watch yourself, mister.

1113
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:40,772
- Hey, lady in the red hat. Yeah.
- You smell.

1114
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:48,280
Guys. Guys, it's me, Ron. Fellas!

1115
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,200
Harken said he'd fire us
if we talked to you.

1116
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:55,120
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1117
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,706
Brian!

1118
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,000
- It's Ronnie!
- Ron!

1119
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,877
- Champ!
- Ron!

1120
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,379
Champ, come on. Come on!

1121
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,463
No, Brick.

1122
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,132
My sweet Brick.

1123
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:11,720
Brick, come hug me. I know you want to.

1124
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,682
I am completely miserable, San Diego!

1125
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:21,146
It's so damn hot!

1126
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,817
Milk was a bad choice!

1127
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,327
Yes, yes. Chris, listen to me.

1128
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,455
Put down the gun
and let the marching band go.

1129
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,957
We'll play it off as a prank.

1130
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:44,085
We'll straighten it out later.
I'm getting another call.

1131
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,962
Ed Harken.

1132
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,256
What? Oh, my God!

1133
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:52,552
Listen, everybody,
Ling Wong the panda is giving birth!

1134
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:55,764
Get Corningstone over there right away!

1135
01:13:55,848 --> 01:14:00,602
The network is picking up the feed.
I want a shot of that panda being born!

1136
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:09,903
This is Ted Nightingale,
Channel 6 News Los Angeles,

1137
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,529
reporting from the San Diego Zoo.

1138
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:16,242
And this is the moment
the entire world has been waiting for.

1139
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:19,162
I can only speculate
as to the sex of the panda,

1140
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:22,374
but if I had to guess, I'd say female.

1141
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,793
- Excuse me. Press.
- Hey, lady, watch it.

1142
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,878
Excuse me, I'm press. Thank you.
What do you got?

1143
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:29,714
Nothing. All I can see is a blue curtain.

1144
01:14:30,675 --> 01:14:31,800
Oh, damn it.

1145
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,720
Go over there and see
if you can get a shot. I'll go this way.

1146
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:39,474
Hey, lady,
why don't you go fetch me a sandwich?

1147
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,893
Okay, I'll go get your sandwich.

1148
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,980
Then I'll show you the ratings
where you're number two to a woman.

1149
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,899
Ouch. Don't lose any more hair over it.

1150
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,820
- Whatever.
- We're live, Mr Mantooth.

1151
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,198
Good afternoon, San Diego.

1152
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,784
We're here today to celebrate
the birth of a panda.

1153
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:19,097
Hey, nut job! Quit the singing!
Creeping out all the regulars.

1154
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:23,101
I'm expressing my inner anguish
through the majesty of song!

1155
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,730
Look, drunky,
you been coming in here every day,

1156
01:15:26,814 --> 01:15:28,481
stinking up the joint with your craziness.

1157
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:32,652
- Now, what the hell is wrong with you?
- I got no heart!

1158
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,779
Because a she-devil stole it!

1159
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,616
You know
what the worst part about it is?

1160
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,703
She's better than me!

1161
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:45,206
She's better than me.

1162
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,793
You know, times are changing.

1163
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,255
Ladies can do stuff now.

1164
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:54,758
You're gonna have to learn
how to deal with that.

1165
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,677
What? Were you saying something?

1166
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,013
Look, I don't speak Spanish.

1167
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:14,944
Scotty. Scotty, I have the shot.

1168
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:16,654
Scotty. Scotty!

1169
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:22,327
Hey, that is some fantastic shot
you got there.

1170
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,871
The kind of shot that gets you
to the top of network news.

1171
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:29,084
- Oh, well, we hope.
- We at public television,

1172
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:32,504
we're really down
with the woman's lib thing.

1173
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:37,383
That is so refreshing to me.
Because the struggle I've...

1174
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,515
Howie, we have the shot.

1175
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:46,684
Up a little. Up, up.

1176
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,395
You son of a bitch!

1177
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:52,941
Don't want to wake up your friends.

1178
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:05,245
Help!

1179
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,997
- Simply vanished.
- How do you lose your lead anchor?

1180
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,083
- I can't find Corningstone.
- Where the hell is she?

1181
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,460
- No one's seen her.
- I can't believe this.

1182
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:16,047
Every news outlet in the world
is looking for coverage on this.

1183
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,883
I've got no damn lead anchor!

1184
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:23,930
Damn it! Get me a phone.
I can't believe I'm about to do this.

1185
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,810
Rocky's Bar, Grill, Fine Dining.

1186
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:32,105
- Is there an anchorman there?
- Hold on.

1187
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:34,774
This is killing me.
I'd rather slit my throat.

1188
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:37,318
- Hello?
- Hello?

1189
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,237
- Is this Ron?
- Who is this?

1190
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,156
- It's me, Ed.
- Who?

1191
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,658
- Ed Harken.
- I don't know a Ned.

1192
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,744
- Ed Harken!
- Ed!

1193
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,496
- Ed, hello.
- Listen, Ron.

1194
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:52,125
Corningstone disappeared in the midst
of the biggest story of the year.

1195
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,377
We need you down here right away.

1196
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:55,920
Wait, Ed.

1197
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:59,090
Does this mean you're asking me
to report the news again?

1198
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,760
- Yes.
- Ed!

1199
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,180
That's wonderful! Thank you!

1200
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,765
Ed, hold on. I want to say a few words.

1201
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,852
- You have always been a good friend!
- Right.

1202
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,437
- Always!
- Right.

1203
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,233
Get down here as quickly as you can.

1204
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,111
Ed, I'll be down there.

1205
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,947
And I'm going to look good.

1206
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,585
Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy.

1207
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:38,630
Damn! That dude cleans up good!

1208
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:42,800
If I'm gonna do this,
I'll need my news team at my side.

1209
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,602
News team!

1210
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:55,104
Assemble!

1211
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:01,945
Ron, I'm coming!

1212
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:06,074
News team, assemble!

1213
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,328
Hey, Ron.

1214
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,996
What's up?

1215
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:16,167
Hi. Didn't see you there.

1216
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,629
We've been here
literally the entire time you have.

1217
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,590
I'm a little embarrassed.

1218
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:23,925
Look.

1219
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,845
I just got the call from Harken.
He wants me back.

1220
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,348
But I can't do this
without my news team.

1221
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,225
I don't know, Ron.

1222
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,228
That was half a lifetime ago.
We're different people now.

1223
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,605
When you left, the hurt was so deep.

1224
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,524
I don't know
if I can go through that again.

1225
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,192
Think about what you're asking.

1226
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:43,194
...man.

1227
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:45,655
Gentlemen,

1228
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:51,744
there was a time
when you called me your lead anchor.

1229
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,250
Will you follow me again?

1230
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:01,170
I'm getting too old for this shit.

1231
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,631
To the news van!

1232
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:05,717
- To the news van!
- Okay!

1233
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:21,941
Well, I'll be. Ron Burgundy. He's back!

1234
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:25,153
Gentlemen, let's try to get
in a good position for the story.

1235
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:27,155
- How does the hair look?
- Magnificent.

1236
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,032
You have hair like an angel.

1237
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:32,327
Network talent scout.

1238
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:35,496
- This is a hot one.
- I'm actually nervous.

1239
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:39,625
Let's go get them.
Wait! Did you just hear something?

1240
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:42,545
Help.

1241
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:45,048
- Ron, help!
- Veronica!

1242
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:47,091
Are you okay?

1243
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,010
How did you get down there?

1244
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,887
Just go get someone. Please.

1245
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:53,681
Hold on. Hold on!

1246
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,269
We've got to do something.

1247
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:01,105
Ron, I don't want to sound cruel, but...

1248
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,816
There's a network talent scout
over there.

1249
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,818
This is a tough decision.

1250
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,945
So much to think about.

1251
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,448
Basically the biggest story of my career,

1252
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:14,452
launching me to a level
I've never known before,

1253
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:18,790
or saving the woman
I used to have familiar relations with.

1254
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:23,461
This is hard! I am in a pickle!

1255
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:29,884
Ron, I know it sounds harsh,
but God does not want her to live.

1256
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,719
No. Hold on.

1257
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,930
It's clear now.

1258
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,810
We go into the bear pit.

1259
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,896
Ron, don't.

1260
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,614
I immediately regret this decision.

1261
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:54,742
What are you doing?
Why didn't you get help?

1262
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:59,122
These bears are massive!
They looked a lot smaller from up there.

1263
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:01,624
Fan out. Let's go find Harken.

1264
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:04,752
Stay calm.

1265
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:10,341
It's all right.
I think it's all right, my sweet chinchilla.

1266
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,343
- Oh, Ron.
- Yes, yes.

1267
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:17,265
In case we die here today,
there's something that you should know.

1268
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:20,101
That dirty trick with the teleprompter,
it wasn't...

1269
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:24,147
Sweet Eli Whitney's nose!
It wasn't you, was it?

1270
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:26,607
It was Wes Mantooth.

1271
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:29,277
- I should have known.
- No, no.

1272
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:31,696
- No, I did it.
- You bitch!

1273
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:38,703
You woke the bears.
Why did you do that?

1274
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:44,459
There's somebody in the bear pit!

1275
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:54,010
It took my impending death
for me to realise how much I need you.

1276
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:55,636
Oh, Ron.

1277
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,558
Those bears are gonna hurt them!

1278
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,561
News team, let's hunt.

1279
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,564
News team!

1280
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,777
Bear fight!

1281
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:17,492
Come on. Come on!

1282
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:25,166
Damn!

1283
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,251
Hit them in the uvula!

1284
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:31,422
Hey, Ron! I'm riding a furry tractor!

1285
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:35,009
The bears have descended
on the news team

1286
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,385
and it's not going well.

1287
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,930
Clearly, after today, I will no longer...

1288
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:42,266
Come on! Oh, God!

1289
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,852
It's getting to be ri-goddamn-diculous!

1290
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:47,939
Oh, no.

1291
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,775
We woke up the mama.

1292
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,029
Oh, God!

1293
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,283
I don't wanna die.

1294
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:02,119
Ron!!!

1295
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:06,123
Baxter!

1296
01:24:12,339 --> 01:24:14,298
Leave these people alone.

1297
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,217
They mean you no harm.

1298
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:20,304
We Bears are a proud race.
They must pay for their intrusion.

1299
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:23,057
In my travels I met one of your kind.

1300
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:25,726
His name was Katow-jo.

1301
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,020
We became friends.

1302
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:31,482
Katow-jo is my cousin.

1303
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,151
Go in peace.

1304
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:38,030
I will tell tales of your compassion.

1305
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:43,160
Fare thee well, Baxter.
You shall always be friend of the bears.

1306
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:51,877
- Look! They're following their mother!
- It's instinct.

1307
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:53,671
Oh, Baxter!

1308
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,925
Oh, Baxter, you're still alive!

1309
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:01,178
Oh, I'm so happy!

1310
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:04,932
I'm so happy! You are alive!

1311
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,643
I'm so happy!

1312
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:15,401
I will lick you!

1313
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:19,196
I will lick you in front of everyone
to show my joy.

1314
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,451
Boy, he really likes that dog.

1315
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:28,289
Burgundy! Burgundy!
Burgundy! Burgundy!

1316
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,625
Burgundy! Burgundy!

1317
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:32,501
Hi, Ron.

1318
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:36,672
It's always a long fall from the top,
isn't it?

1319
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:37,882
Easy, Wes.

1320
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:41,344
I've been waiting to say this to you
for a long time.

1321
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:43,971
- All right.
- Deep down in my stomach,

1322
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:46,349
with every inch of me,

1323
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:50,311
I pure, straight hate you!

1324
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,443
But, God damn it, do I respect you!

1325
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:13,250
Thank you, brother.

1326
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,964
Burgundy! Burgundy!

1327
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:23,427
Today we spell redemption, R-O-N.

1328
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:26,097
Burgundy! Burgundy!

1329
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,516
Ron, you're my hero!

1330
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,186
Ron, I think you've got a story to report.

1331
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:37,483
- Are you sure, Ed?
- Do it.

1332
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:41,278
It's the story you were born to tell.

1333
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:48,911
San Diego's waiting. Go get them.

1334
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:50,621
Make way!

1335
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,416
Ron Burgundy's about to report
on pandas!

1336
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:57,837
Count me down. Three.

1337
01:26:57,921 --> 01:26:59,672
You're live, Mr Burgundy.

1338
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,590
This is Ron Burgundy,

1339
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:05,344
proudly reporting once again
for Channel 4 News.

1340
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:09,390
Today's story is one
of the more remarkable things

1341
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:14,145
ever to happen to San Diago
or even the world.

1342
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,231
But in order to properly retell it,

1343
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:21,986
I'm going to need some help
from my co-anchor,

1344
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,406
Miss Veronica Corningstone.

1345
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:29,702
- High-pressure system...
- No, no, no, no, Brick.

1346
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:32,830
- High-pressure system...
- Go stand over there.

1347
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,501
Oh, Ron.

1348
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:41,172
Ron, there are literally thousands
of men that I should be with instead,

1349
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,800
but I am 72% sure that I love you.

1350
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:55,478
Yes, redemption was sweet
for Ron Burgundy.

1351
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,980
Yes! Ron!

1352
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:01,609
- As for the news team...
- Stop it! Ron!

1353
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:05,321
Champ Kind went on to become
a commentator for the NFL,

1354
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:07,239
but was later fired after being accused

1355
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:11,452
of sexual harassment
by Terry Bradshaw.

1356
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,454
Excuse me.

1357
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,915
Is that Sex Panther you're wearing?

1358
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,961
Brian Fantana went on
to have great success

1359
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:25,883
as the host of the hit reality TV show
Intercourse Island on the FOX Network.

1360
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:28,844
Anyone seen Brick?

1361
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,679
- Brick?
- Don't! That tickles!

1362
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:33,933
No, that tickles me! Come on!

1363
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:37,436
Brick Tamland is married
with 11 children

1364
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:40,940
and is one of the top political advisors
to the Bush White House.

1365
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:43,776
I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!

1366
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,656
Hey! Is she going to live with us?

1367
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,493
Because I am not cool with that.

1368
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:57,748
And Ron and Veronica didn't stay
in San Diego long.

1369
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,587
I chose them as my replacement,

1370
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:07,007
and they became the first
mixed-gender network news team,

1371
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:09,426
and they're still doing it today.

1372
01:29:10,387 --> 01:29:12,513
From all of us here
at the World News Center,

1373
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,473
I'm Veronica Corningstone.

1374
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,308
And I'm Ron Burgundy.

1375
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:19,311
You stay classy, planet Earth.

1376
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:39,957
Great Odin's raven!

1377
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:43,335
By the hammer of Thor!

1378
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:46,630
Saint Damien's beard!

1379
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,550
Sweet grandmother's spatula!

1380
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,386
Hot pot of coffee!

1381
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,806
Uncle Jonathan's corncob pipe!

1382
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,562
I'm gonna shoot you with a BB gun
when you're not looking.

1383
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,397
In the back of the head.

1384
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,982
I'm sorry.

1385
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,653
You're not very bright.
You know that, right?

1386
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,405
You're actually quite a dullard.

1387
01:30:11,489 --> 01:30:13,490
Everyone here knows it.

1388
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:18,203
If I'm a dullard, you're the dull...

1389
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:21,415
Can't think of anything to say, can you?

1390
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,251
Yes, I can.
I can think of a lot of things to say.

1391
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,545
Like, you're a dirty bitch.

1392
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:34,094
Well, Ron, I'm gonna put poison...
Oh, my God!

1393
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:41,894
I drank a lava lamp. It wasn't lava.

1394
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:45,105
I ate a whole bunch
of fibreglass insulation.

1395
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:48,442
It wasn't cotton candy like that guy said.

1396
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,361
My stomach's itchy.

1397
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,987
I pooped a hammer.

1398
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:53,781
I pooped a tape recorder.

1399
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:56,075
I pooped a Cornish game hen.

1400
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,081
Nope.

1401
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,084
You do not take a tone with me,

1402
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:08,462
'cause I will give you a rap
right on the Jack Johnson!

1403
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:10,047
- Okay.
- Yes.

1404
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:11,674
Now this is happening.

1405
01:31:11,758 --> 01:31:14,927
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1406
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,346
What are you...

1407
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:22,977
Action.

1408
01:31:23,061 --> 01:31:24,812
We'll go back to doing what I do best...

1409
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,898
I guess we'll go back to doing
what I do best, show off.

1410
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:31,527
- When do we get started?
- When do we get started?

1411
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,487
- That's my line.
- When do we get started?

1412
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,698
You say, "Whenever you like. "

1413
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,408
Whenever you like.

1414
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,743
Keep it rolling. This is good stuff.

1415
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:44,164
...an area bank in a daring...

1416
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:47,751
Probably not the same one.
Probably not the same guy.

1417
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:56,468
Brick, before I let you go,

1418
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:58,887
are you still having your celebrity
golf tournament this summer?

1419
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:00,931
No, too many people died last year.

1420
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:03,350
So we're not gonna do...

1421
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,144
Sorry. Sorry.

1422
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:09,440
They named it San Diego.

1423
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:13,277
Which in German means
a whale's vagina.

1424
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:22,619
This is the most ridiculous thing ever.

1425
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,258
Way to handle him. That was nice.

1426
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,094
It sure is good to be number one.

1427
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:23,013
It sure beats the hell out of number two.

1428
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:26,600
We are laughing!

1429
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:28,977
And we are very good friends.

1430
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:31,897
Good buddies
sharing a special moment.

1431
01:33:31,981 --> 01:33:34,817
Don't say anything, Ron.
Just let it happen.

1432
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:37,903
We're laughing, enjoying our friendship.

1433
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:41,490
And someday we'll look back on this
with much fondness.

1434
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:43,700
Yeah.

1435
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,207
Yeah.
