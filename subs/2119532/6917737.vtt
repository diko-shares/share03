Even youths grow tired and weary,

43
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.370

They dug up the corner of Jackson and Main...

69

71
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.960

Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.

72

They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.

他已经够暴力了
He's violent enough already.

104

好吧  给他一个充满母爱的吻吧

告诉他这是个温柔祥和的世界

107
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.760
-我差点杀了他  -是的

杀人是最大的罪过
Murder, it's the worst sin of all.

取他人性命
And to take another man's life,

110
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.000
在主眼中是最深重的罪孽
that is the most egregious sin in the Lord's sight.

111

没有比这更伤他心的事了

还要我再说一遍吗
Do I have to tell you again?

滚开  臭婆娘  不然打死你
You move, woman, or I will wallop you good and hard!

他为什么这么恨我们
Why does he hate us so much?

121
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.160
他不是恨我们
Oh, he don't hate us.

122
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.680
有时他只是恨自己
He hates himself sometimes.

123
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.960
这不是你爸爸的本性
Your daddy tonight, that ain't the real him.

124

真希望你们像我一样知道他战前的样子

像一群天使  妈
Like a heavenly host of angels, Mom.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.720
你知道说谎是犯诫的  尤其在这里
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie, especially in this place.

135
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.400
我可没说是擅长唱歌的天使
Well, I ain't never said they were singing angels.

136

239
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.280
那是因为太暗了看不清
That's because I'm sitting in the dark.

Why didn't you say nothing to us?

250
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.130
你们肯定会千方百计阻止我
'Cause you would have tried and talked me out of it,

251
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.870
而我知道这才是正确的选择
and I know what I'm doing is right.

252
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.400
《摩西十诫》怎么办
And what about His Commandment?

253
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.450
这场战争于我并不是杀戮  而是保护
It's not killing in a war. It's protecting.

254
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.320
咱们教堂里不少青年都报了名
Loads of boys from our church are going.

255
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.440
-是啊  -这场战争需要男人去打
- Yeah. - There is a war and they need men.

256
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.920
在造纸厂工作没法拯救国家
And working in a paper mill ain't going to save this country.

257
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.040
咱儿子看上去就像电影明星
Looks like a movie star, our boy.

258
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.690
漂亮的军装  精致的帽子
Nice uniform, good hat.

259
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.840
让我想起阿蒂·吉登斯
Reminds me of how Artie Giddens

260
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.290
我们在法国那会儿他也这身打扮
looked in his uniform when we went to France.

261
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.000
-还记得他吗  贝莎  -别说了  汤姆
- Remember him, Bertha? - Don't, Tom.

262
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.160
怎么了
What?

263
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.360
我只是说阿蒂穿军装很精神
I'm just saying how snappy Artie looked in his uniform.

264
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.120
你们姑娘们显然也这么觉得
All you girls certainly seemed to think so.

265
00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.170
像苍蝇一样围着他  那时他多有面儿啊
He had them flocking to him. He was most proud.

266
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.960
我只希望哈尔被子弹打中时
I just hope that when our Hal gets shot,

267
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.560
子弹是从正面穿过他的夹克
it's through the front of his jacket.

268
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.760
就钻了个眼儿  没弄得血肉模糊
Like a simple entry wound, not much mess.

269
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.650
阿蒂那时被击中后背
Artie got hit in the back,

270
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.510
他的五脏六腑
it blew most of his guts and intestines

271
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.280
从前襟迸裂出来  弄得到处都是
out his front, offal everywhere.

272
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.760
彻底把那身军装给毁了
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

273
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.160
还好他已经死了
It was lucky he was dead,

274
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.600
永远不会知道那身军装看起来有多糟
so he never knew how awful his uniform looked.

275
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.890
别让我看到你
Get outta of my sight.

276
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.960
你是野山羊吗  这么能爬
What are you, part mountain goat?

277
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.520
你是准备帮把手呢  戴斯蒙德·多斯
Are you going to help me, Desmond Doss,

278
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.440
还是让我就这么傻站着
or are you just going to leave me stranded?

279
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.520
我帮你  但要有代价
I'll help you, but it's gonna cost you.

280
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.680
什么
What?

281
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240
一个吻
A kiss.

282
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.640
-简直就是讹诈  -当然  女士  就是讹你
- That is pure blackmail. - Well, yes, ma'am, it is.

283
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.680
我坚持这么要价
But that is still my condition.

284
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.360
就这么定了  我会督促你执行的
That's the deal. And I'm going to hold you to it.

285
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.320
别急啊
Well, hold on now.

286
00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.560
这次不会扇我耳光了吧
You ain't gonna slap me, are you?

287
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.000
我要掉下去  肯定拉你一起
'Cause I fall off, I'm going to take you with me.

288
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.360
吻了才知道
Kiss me and find out.

289
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:14.580
《坎宁汉实用解剖学手册》

290
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400
怎么了
What?

291
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.600
我得参军
I have to enlist.

292
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.400
我不能躲在这让其他人为我而战
I can't stay here while all of them go fight for me.

293
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.320
-你可以留下的  -多萝西  我必须去
- Yes, you can. You can stay here. - Dorothy, I have to.

294
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.080
我要做个军医
I want to be a medic.

295
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.360
我想好了  我去救人  而不是杀人
I figure I'll be saving people, not killing them.

296
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.680
我得去上班了  快迟到了
I have to go to work. I'm going to be late.

297
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.320
多萝西  多萝西  亲爱的  多萝西
Dorothy. Dorothy, darling. Dorothy. Dorothy!

298
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.760
你到底要不要向我求婚
So are you going to ask me to marry you or what?

299
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.200
不知道  你还要我吗
Well, I don't know. You still going to have me?

300
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.400
我哪知道  你都还没问
Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.

301
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.120
那我真心实意地问你
Well, I'm asking you, with all my heart and then some.

302
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.250
-你愿意嫁给我吗  -是的  我愿意
- Will you marry me? - Then, yes. Yes, I will.

303
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.410
什么时候
When?

304
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.920
你第一次放假回来的时候
Soon as you get your first leave.

305
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.160
但此时此刻我还是很恨你
But I still don't like you at this moment.

306
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.280
好吧
Okay.

307
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.800
好吧  我可爱你呢
Okay. Well, I love you.

308
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.560
妈说让我来这找你
Momma said come see you here.

309
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.720
嗯
Yeah.

310
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.080
这三个是我最好的朋友
These three were my best friends.

311
00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:02.890
爱德华·米勒
弗吉尼亚州
生于1900年 林奇堡
逝于1918年 贝洛林苑
为国捐躯

312
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.920
和我一起长大
I grew up with 'em,

313
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
我们一起惹麻烦  一起泡妞
I got into trouble with 'em, chased girls with 'em.

314
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.240
一起入伍
And I enlisted with 'em.

315
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.800
现在他们躺在那里
Now my friends are there,

316
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.560
埋在草坪底下喂虫子
covered in dirt and grass and eaten by worms.

317
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.400
我不想以后也来这看我儿子
I don't want to have to visit my sons here.

318
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.480
爸  我已经报名了
Daddy, I signed up already.

319
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.920
我别无选择  爸  别人都报了名...
I couldn't do otherwise, Pop. Everybody else is doing...

320
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.680
你又不是别人
You ain't everybody else!

321
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.920
别人只会一股脑扎进去  不经思考
Everybody else jumps in and does things quick, without thinking!

322
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.760
就和我们当年一样蠢
Like the damn idiot fools we were.

323
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.630
而那些活着的士兵
And soldiers who live,

324
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.570
他们能活下来是因为他们有那个本事
they live because they can do that!

325
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.240
可你没有
You can't!

326
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.600
凡事你都得坐下来想半天  还要祷告
Look, you gotta sit and think and pray about everything.

327
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.650
看看  就像你现在这样
I mean, look at you, you're doing it right now.

328
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.800
你要是上了战场  是不可能活着回来的
You won't be able to live with yourself if you go.

329
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.880
不  如果我不去  我没法过自己这关
No, I won't be able to live with myself if I don't.

330
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.930
我要去做一名医务兵  这是我服役的方式
I'm going to be a medic. That's going to be my way to serve.

331
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.890
看看  你就是这样  什么都靠空想
See, there you go, thinking it all out.

332
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.910
怎么  你以为这场战争会围着你转
What, you figure this war

333
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.370
会按照你的意愿进行的吗
is just going to fit in with you, your ideas?

334
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.720
我毫不怀疑肯定会困难重重
Well, I don't doubt it's going to be hard.

335
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.480
不是困难重重  而是根本不可能
It won't be hard, it'll be impossible.

336
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.360
不管你那疯狂的脑子里装着怎样的信仰
You know, whatever beliefs you have in your crazy head now,

337
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.600
一点用都没有  事情不是这么进行的
they won't ever play out. It don't work that way.

338
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.680
要真是出现奇迹  你能活下来
And if by some, I don't know, miracle chance you survive,

339
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.520
你可真要好好感谢上帝了
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

340
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.400
-准备好了吗  -好了
- Ready? - Ready.

341
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.530
你们都需要空间
Y'all need some air.

342
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.570
走吧  小伙子们  你们现在归山姆大叔了
Come on, fellas, shake a leg. Uncle Sam's got you now.

343
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.000
跟你妈妈说再见  快来
Say goodbye to Momma. Come on.

344
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.480
女士们  请离汽车远点儿
Ladies, please, step away from the bus.

345
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.370
-我差点忘了  给  -要我拿铁撬棍吗
- I almost forgot. Here. - Do I need a crowbar?

346
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.120
我想让你拿着这个  这是我的
I want you to have this. It's mine.

347
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.560
你把它带在身边  就像我一直陪着你
You keep it right here, where I'll be.

348
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.000
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

349
00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.640
我爱你
I love you.

350
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.640
《圣经》

351
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:29.580

别那么说我女朋友
Hey, don't say that about my girl.

354
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.770
-还有什么...  -看着点
- What else... - Hey. Oh.

355
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.160
抱歉  伙计
Hey. Sorry, pal.

356
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.200
说明你就是那个人
...means you're the person.

357
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.650
我每次回自己的床铺都要看见你这畸形吗
Do I have to gaze at your deformity every time I walk to my bed?

358
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.370
你就嫉妒吧  我的朋友
Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.

359
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.560
你还好吧  像丢了魂儿似的  这儿有空位
You okay there? You look lost. Vacancy right here.

360
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.080
明智的选择  在这儿可以看到山和湖
Wise choice. It's got views of the mountains down to the lake.

363
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.450
叫他"老师"  他的话没人听得懂
Call him "Teach." No one understands a word he says.

364
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.320
因为这里就没人能认字
That's because no one else here can read.

365
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.640
这位睾丸先生自称"好莱坞"
The testicles there belong to a man calling himself "Hollywood."

366
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.160
不过型号看起来该属于体型更小的人
They look like they belong to a smaller guy.

367
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.000
你还挺了解睾丸啊
You know testicles.

368
00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.920
我才刚领的鞋

你娶了你的表亲吗  我开玩笑的
You marry your first cousin? I'm just joking.

373
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.080
那是史密提  在让卡赞斯基出丑
That's Smitty over there, whipping Kirzinski's ass.

374
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.610
说得好像你多能干似的  笨蛋
Like you were doing any better, chowder head.

375
00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.160
我那是不想让你难堪
Hey, I didn't want to embarrass you.

还有维多· 雷纳利
And, uh, Vito Rinnelli.

381
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.720
别看他个子小  他可不好惹
He may be small, but he is a bulldog.

382
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.080
-你好  -你好

383
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.760

388
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.170
格里斯[意同油脂]  消停点儿行吗
Pipe down, Grease, all right?

389
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.400
你是不是想把钱塞进自己嘴里
Unless you want to put your money where your mouth is.

390
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.200
一本古老的好书啊  是吧
Oh, hey, the old good book, right?

391
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.930
卢奇好像也有本好书
I think Lucky's got a good book.

Do you know why it's not possible, Private?

535
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.450
不知道  长官
No, sir.

536
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.170
因为美国军队从不犯错
Because the United States Army does not make mistakes.

537
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.450
所以如果有问题  那一定出在你身上
So if there's a problem, you must be that problem.

538
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.600
他们不应该把我送到步枪连
I was just never supposed to be sent to a rifle company.

539
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.400
他是因道义原因拒服兵役者  长官
He's a C.O., sir.

540
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.500
格洛弗上尉

541
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.160
因为道义而拒服兵役  而你却来参了军
You're a conscientious objector, and you joined the Army?

542
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.520
不  长官  我是个尽责的合作者
Well, no, sir, I'm a conscientious cooperator.

543
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.250
你在拿我消遣吗  多斯
Are you screwing with me, Doss?

544
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.530
不  长官  我是自愿参军的
No. No, sir. I volunteered.

545
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.410
我可以穿军装
I ain't got no problem with wearing my uniform,

546
00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.520
也可以朝国旗敬礼  并履行我的义务
or saluting the flag and doing my duty.

547
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.680
只是我不能拿枪和杀人
It's just carrying a gun and the taking of human life.

548
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.370
你不杀人  仅此而已
You don't kill? That's all.

549
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.520
是的  长官  仅此而已
Yes, sir, that's all.

550
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.250
你知道战争总是会让很多人送命吧
You know quite a bit of killing does occur in a war?

551
00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.360
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

552
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.400
这才是战争的真谛
I mean, that is the essential nature of war.

553
00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.720
-是  长官  -好吧
- Yes, sir. - All right.

554
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:01.120
你对美国军队还有什么其他要求吗
Do you have any other requirements of the United States Army?

555
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.010
我们还有什么其他要注意的吗
Is there anything else that we can do to ensure

556
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.730
好让你觉得和我们在一起舒服点儿
that you have a comfortable stay here with us?

557
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.600
他周六不想工作  长官
He doesn't want to work on Saturdays, sir.

558
00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.680
周六  是这样的
Well, Saturdays...

559
00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.960
我是基督七日复临安息日会的信徒
I'm a Seventh-day Adventist.

560
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:16.040
周六是安息日  所以我不能工作
So, Saturday is my Sabbath, so I'm not allowed to work then.

561
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.560
这应该没有什么问题吧  中士
I don't think that poses a problem, do you, Sergeant?

562
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.240
我们应该直接告诉敌人周六不要进攻
We shall simply ask the enemy not to invade on the Sabbath,

563
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.080
因为二等兵多斯要在这天祷告
'cause Private Doss here is at prayer.

564
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.890
好吧  我明白了
All right. Now we got that clear.

565
00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.280
现在让我来说说我的要求吧
Now let me tell you my requirements.

566
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.570
我的要求没有你那么复杂  我的要求很简单
They're not as complicated as yours. They're very simple.

567
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.610
只要你在这个连队里一天  在我的指挥之下
As long as you're in this company, under my command,

568
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.720
你就必须遵循我的命令  就是这样
you will obey my orders. Period.

569
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.120
如果你在这里都做不到
If you can't do it here,

570
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.400
我无法相信你在战场上能做到
I can't trust you to do it in battle.

571
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:54.060
我会用第八条例  让你因精神问题而退伍
I'm putting you in for a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.

572
00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.000
解散
Dismissed.

573
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.800
先生们
Gentlemen!

574
00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.640
我想让你们认识一下二等兵戴斯蒙德·多斯
I want you to meet Private Desmond Doss.

575
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.880
显然二等兵多斯不喜欢暴力
Apparently, Private Doss does not believe in violence.

576
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.840
他拒绝使用暴力
He does not practice violence.

577
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.160
他甚至不肯屈尊去触碰武器
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

578
00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:15.800
二等兵多斯是个因道义原因拒服兵役者
You see, Private Doss is a conscientious objector.

579
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.160
我恳请你们
So I plead with you, do not

580
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.800
别指望他在战场上救你们
look to him to save you on the battlefield,

581
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.970
因为他那时一定忙着
because he will undoubtedly be

582
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:27.320
和他所谓的良知作斗争呢
too busy wrestling with his conscience to assist.

583
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.010
中士  不是这样的
Sarge, that's not true.

584
00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.800
二等兵  你明明就是
Private, as you were.

585
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.520
我知道你们也许有人对此颇有看法
Now, I realize some of you might have strong feelings about this.

586
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.840
这就是我们参战的原因
It is what we men fight for.

587
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.800
捍卫我们的权利  保护我们的女人和孩子们
To defend our rights, and to protect our women and children.

588
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.760
尽管二等兵多斯的信仰
Even if Private Doss'

589
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.880
可能会让女人们和孩子们无辜死去
beliefs might cause women and children to die.

590
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.480
我希望连队里的每个人都能
So I will expect everyone in this company

591
00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.840
在二等兵多斯仅剩不多的跟我们共处的时间内
to give Private Doss the full measure of respect he is due

592
00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.890
给他充分的尊重
for the short time he will be with us.

593
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.520
听明白了吗
Am I clear?

594
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.090
是  中士
Yes, Sergeant.

595
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.850
看看这是什么  小多斯
What'cha got there, Dessie?

596
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.000
你知道那是什么
You know what that is.

597
00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.200
只是看起来有点小
It just seems kind of small.

598
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.930
给小人用的小圣经
It's half the Bible for half the man.

599
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.650
看在上帝的份上  史密提  把圣经还给他
For Pete's sake, Smitty, give him back his Bible.

600
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.330
我好像没跟你说话吧
I don't remember speaking to you.

601
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.840
你为什么不作战  你以为你高人一等吗
So, how come you don't fight? You think you're better than us?

602
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.600
不
No.

603
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.880
如果有人攻击你怎么办
What if you was attacked?

604
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.120
就像这样
Say, like that.

605
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.960
圣经上说  还要把另一边脸送上去  对吗
The Bible says to turn the other cheek, don't it?

606
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.720
你看  我觉得这不是宗教问题  小子
See, I don't think this is a question of religion, fellas.

607
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.560
我觉得这是怯懦  就这么简单
I think this is cowardice, plain and simple.

608
00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.680
-对吗  多斯  -你是个胆小鬼  对吗
- Is that right, Doss? - Are you chickenshit, that it?

609
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.800
来啊  动手啊
Go on, take a poke.

610
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.320
告诉你  我让你白打一下
Tell you what, I'm going to give you a free shot.

611
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:10.880
来吧  这儿
Right there.

612
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.090
动手啊  多斯  打我
Hit me, Doss. Go on.

613
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.610
-揍他  -上啊
- Let him have it. - Go ahead.

614
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.680
不打吗
No?

615
00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.240
胆小鬼
Chickenshit.

616
00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.800
等一下  这是什么
Hold on here. What is this?

617
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.250
还给我
Give me that.

618
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.160
-是个漂亮妞  -真不赖
- This is a fine-looking broad. - Nice.

619
00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.810
传给大家看看
Hey, pass it around.

620
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.930
这种小妞儿就得让真男人驾驭
Now, this would be the kind of broad that deserves a real man.

621
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.320
还给我
Give me that back.

622
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.560
要说请
Please.

623
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.160
请
Please.

624
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.640
请还给我  史密提
"Please give it back, Smitty."

625
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.680
请还给我  史密提
Please give it back, Smitty.

626
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.440
你有幻听吗  戴斯蒙德
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

627
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.120
没有  长官
No, sir.

628
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.840
但据我理解  上帝会跟你对话  是吗
But I understand that God talks to you. Is that right?

629
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.640
长官  我没疯
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

630
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.440
你觉得大家都认为你是疯子吗
Is that how you feel most people regard you, a crazy person?

631
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.330
我知道  我和其他人不同  但是...
I'm different. I know that, but...

632
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.400
我也不打算装疯卖傻
I'm not going to pretend to be something I'm not.

633
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.440
-我就是我  -听起来有点孤独
- I am what I am. - Sounds lonely.

634
00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.560
你觉得孤独吗
You lonely?

635
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.080
-你没有幻听  -是的长官
- So, you don't hear voices. - No, sir.

636
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.080
我会祷告  并希望上帝听到了我的祈祷
I pray to God and I like to think He hears me,

637
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.440
但祷告不是对话
but it ain't a conversation,

638
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.360
像我们俩现在就是在假装对话
like the one we're pretending to have right now.

639
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.280
-假装吗  二等兵  -是的  长官
- Pretending, Private? - Well, yes, sir.

640
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.520
我知道您想说
I know all you really want to

641
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.560
我有精神问题  好打发我退伍
do is give me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army,

642
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:57.080
但我脑子没问题  我只是坚持信仰而已
but I'm not off up above. I just simply believe what I believe.

643
00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.130
我在试着理解你  好吗
Well, I'm trying to understand, all right?

644
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.170
是上帝告诉你不能拿枪的吗
Was it God who told you not to pick up a rifle?

645
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.360
上帝说  不可杀人
God says not to kill.

646
00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.280
这是他最重要的诫示
That's one of His most important Commandments.

647
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.880
大部分人理解为  不可谋杀别人
Most people take that to mean, "Don't commit murder."

648
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.320
战争可完全不一样
War is a completely different set of circumstances.

649
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.120
耶稣说 我赐给你们一条新命令
Jesus said, "A new Commandment

650
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.880
乃是叫你们彼此相爱
I give unto you,

651
00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.960
我怎样爱你们  你们也要怎样相爱
that you love one another, just as I have loved you."

652
00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.200
但我们面对的是撒旦
This is Satan himself we're fighting.

653
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.560
作为虔诚的基督徒  你当然能明白吧
Surely, as a good Christian, you can see that.

654
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.040
我明白  长官  所以我报名参了军
I can see that, sir, and that is why I joined up.

655
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.240
但很抱歉  我不携带武器
But I'm sorry, I will not bear arms.

656
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.000
他的宗教观点很独特
His religious views are certainly unique,

657
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:45.600
但是并不符合第八条例的开除军籍规定
but they do not constitute grounds for a Section 8 discharge.

658
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.900
有个这样的人在
How am I supposed to maintain

659
00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.720
我还怎么管理连队
discipline with a man like that in my unit?

660
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.290
我也不知道
I don't know.

661
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.640
但他是正当的因道义原因拒服兵役者
But he is a legitimate conscientious objector,

662
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.080
只要他的各项训练达标
and he must be allowed to work as a combat medic,

663
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.720
就不能拒绝他成为一名战地医护人员
provided he qualifies in all other areas of his training.

664
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.480
也许我们可以帮忙让他信点别的
Perhaps we could help make believe in his idea.

665
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.240
对  让他去清扫营房  当帮厨
Yeah, you restrict him to barracks and KP.

666
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.680
他跟你聊上帝  你就送他下地狱
If he throws God at you, you throw hell right at him.

667
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.040
把他赶走
I want him gone.

668
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.600
多斯  你的内务太丢脸了  这是猪圈
Doss, your area is a disgrace. It's a pig sty!

669
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.520
-好笑吗  莱克  -不  中士
- Something funny, Ryker? - No, Sarge!

670
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.160
-你脑子里糊了屎吗  -没有  中士
- You got some shit on your mind? - No, Sarge!

671
00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.800
你们都没有意识到的是
What you men fail to recognize

672
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.640
一颗老鼠屎会坏一锅汤
is a unit is no better than its weakest member!

673
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.820
为了让大家明白
Now, to help you learn that lesson,

674
00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.040
本周末不准外出
there will be no passes this weekend.

675
00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.560
你们都要去当帮厨
You will all be on KP!

676
00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.040
现在  全副武装准备开始30公里拉练
Right now, everybody in full gear for a 20-mile hike.

677
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.770
快点  出发
Let's go! Let's go.

678
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.640
昂首挺胸
Get your heads right.

679
00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.960
别可怜你们自己
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

680
00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.120
看到你们可怜自己我会恶心
Makes me sick see you feel sorry for yourself.

681
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.520
你们这些畜生根本没见识过什么是累
You dogs don't know what tired is.

682
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.800
我不说停谁都别想休息
We're going to keep going till I drop.

683
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.680
够了  还让不让人睡觉了
Hey, knock it off. Trying to sleep here.

684
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.080
-走开  别碰我  -好  好吧
- Get off me. Get off me. - Okay. All right.

685
00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.680
你他妈为什么不走呢
Why the hell are you still here?

686
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.520
原地立定
As you were.

687
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.120
多斯呢
Where's Doss?

688
00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.210
这样对谁都不好
This isn't good for anybody.

689
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.280
我当初参军肯定不是为了这样
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

690
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.760
这跟你参军的目的无关
It's not about what you joined up for.

691
00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.360
这关乎到每个人的性命
It's about the lives of every man in here.

692
00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:42.920
还有你自己的命  孩子  是时候退出了
And yours, son. It's time to quit this.

693
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.050
穿好衣服  我带你走
Finish getting dressed and I'll walk you down.

694
00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.040
没事的  多斯
It's okay, Doss.

695
00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.160
没什么不好意思的
There's no shame in this.

696
00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.560
走吧
Let's go.

697
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:20.880
我今天还要站岗  今早还要去帮厨...
I got extra guard duty today, and I'm on KP this morning, so...

698
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.880
我不能走
Can't.

699
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.970
好吧  多斯
All right, Doss.

700
00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:39.130
二等兵多斯  你能认出是谁打了你吗
Private Doss, can you identify the men that beat you?

701
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.880
不知道  长官
No, Sarge.

702
00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:51.120
你是说你不知道被谁打了吗
Are you saying that you don't know who attacked you?

703
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.120
我从来没说过有人打我  长官
I never said I was attacked, Sarge.

704
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.720
你在说什么胡话  多斯
Well, what the hell are you saying, Doss?

705
00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.960
你睡觉的时候把自己弄得满身是伤吗
You bruised half your body sleeping?

706
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.960
我  我睡觉很不老实
I... I sleep pretty hard.

707
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.520
好吧
Alright.

708
00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.250
如果这周末有什么湿身计划
If you plan on getting wet this weekend,

709
00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.210
记得做好保护措施
make sure you put on a hat.

710
00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.650
下一位
Next.

711
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.840
可不想有谁回来弄得下体感染[尿的东西像奶油]
Don't want anyone coming back pissing cream.

712
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.200
怎么  你的咖啡里不想来点吗  中士
What, you don't want none for your coffee, Sarge?

713
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.850
要不就现在吧  史密提
How about a shot right now, Smitty?

714
00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.840
-你这是经验之谈吗  中士  -下一位
- You speaking from experience, Sarge? - Next.

715
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.050
那得问你老妈了  油脂球
You'd have to ask your mom about that, Greaseball.

716
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.880
稍息
At ease.

717
00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.440
二等兵多斯  恐怕不能给你出入证了
Private Doss, I'm afraid I can't authorize your pass.

718
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.000
只有通过了基础训练的人才能出去
This is a furlough for men who have passed the basic training.

719
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.280
长官  无意冒犯  我通过了
Well, sir, respectfully, sir, I have.

720
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.200
我三周前就申请了出入证
I put in for this furlough three weeks ago.

721
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.480
我今天下午要结婚
I'm getting married this afternoon.

722
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.450
上面写着你的射击不合格
It says you're not rifle qualified.

723
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.350
我不用配枪
Well, I'm not required to carry a rifle,

724
00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:02.450
施特尔策上校  他说...
sir. Colonel Stelzer, he...

725
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.760
施特尔策上校的决定是...
Colonel Stelzer's determination was...

726
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.720
"如果多斯的其他各项训练都达标
"Doss must be allowed to work as a combat medic,

727
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:13.120
就可以成为战地医护人员"
provided he qualifies in all other areas of his training."

728
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.010
但你的射击训练不合格
And you have not qualified on the rifle range, Private.

729
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.040
清晰明了
Pretty clear.

730
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.950
要不你现在就证明
Show me you know how to

731
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:26.240
你知道怎么用枪  我就批准你外出
handle a rifle and I'll sign your furlough.

732
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.240
-卡农下士  -是
- Corporal Cannon. - Sir!

733
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.480
把你的武器给二等兵多斯
Hand Private Doss your firearm.

734
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.520
我不碰枪  长官
I won't touch a rifle, sir.

735
00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:44.130
我不是征求你的意见  二等兵
I'm not asking you, Private!

736
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.880
这是来自连长的直接命令
That is a direct order from a company commander.

737
00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:54.200
拜托  多斯  别再挣扎了  走吧
For God's sake, Doss, you stop this nonsense and quit.

738
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:59.240
如果你拒绝  我就只能把你送上军事法庭了
Refuse, and I will have no recourse but to court-martial you,

739
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.720
战争期间  你将在军事监狱度过
and you will spend the duration of the war in a military prison.

740
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.120
我不能碰枪  长官
I can't, sir.

741
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.010
还要等多久  多萝西
How much longer would you like to wait, Dorothy?

742
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.800
已经够久了
I think it's been long enough.

743
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.920
我很遗憾
I'm so very sorry.

744
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.320
有时候男人会临阵脱逃
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

745
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.520
也许其他男人会  但我的戴斯蒙德不会
Some men might. Not my Desmond.

746
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.170
你可能觉得我是个彻头彻尾的混蛋
You probably think I'm a real son of a bitch

747
00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.000
只关心规定  不关心士兵
who cares only about regulations and not his men.

748
00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.120
我能看看吗
May I?

749
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.080
我和任何人一样信仰这本书
I believe in this book as much as any man.

750
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.890
我也和任何人一样  跟自己的良心斗争
And just like any man, I wrestle with my conscience,

751
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.110
但如果
but what do you do when

752
00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:36.680
你珍惜的一切都在遭受袭击怎么办
everything you value in this world is under attack?

753
00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.530
我不知道  长官
I don't know, sir.

754
00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.160
我回答不了这么大的问题
I ain't got answers to questions that big,

755
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.920
但我也觉得我的价值观受到了攻击
but I also feel like my values are under attack,

756
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.560
但我不知道原因
and I don't know why.

757
00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.030
我根本不关心你的信仰
I don't give a rat's ass

758
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:53.640
因为日本人不会关心
about your principles because the Japs don't.

759
00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:55.960
如果他们袭击你和伤员
If one of them attacks you and some wounded soldier,

760
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.040
你怎么办
what are you gonna do?

761
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.080
用圣经敲他们的头吗
Hit him with your Bible?

762
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.400
我可以为了战友付出生命
I'm prepared to give my life for my men.

763
00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.040
光靠牺牲可赢不了战争
You don't win wars by giving up your life.

764
00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:07.960
我来这里是因为
Look, I'm only here because I

765
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:10.960
我不想你一直在监牢里等死
don't want to see you rotting in a prison cell.

766
00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.610
认罪吧  请求法庭宽大处理
Plead guilty, throw yourself at the mercy of the court.

767
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.400
也许他们会放你回家祷告
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

768
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.050
让真正的勇士去冲锋陷阵  血战沙场
Let the brave men out there go and win this war.

769
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.570
如果我还是说服不了你  也许她可以
If I can't convince you, maybe she can.

770
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.040
他们不让我给你打电话
They wouldn't let me call you.

771
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.970
我知道不是你的错
I knew it wasn't your making.

772
00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.760
他们都怎么对你了
What have they done to you?

773
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.610
我没事  我还好
It's okay, I'm all right.

774
00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.920
只是对着墙壁发泄了一会儿
I just went a couple of rounds with the wall and lost.

775
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.200
他们说你可能会进监狱  戴斯蒙德
They're saying you could go to prison, Desmond.

776
00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:58.320
去莱文沃斯[美国城市]
Leavenworth.

777
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.320
肯定还有别的方法
There must be some other way.

778
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.240
我不知道还能有什么办法
I don't know what that could be.

779
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.490
除了用枪  我每件事都照办了
I've done everything they asked me, except this one thing,

780
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.120
就因为我不杀人  他们就把我当成罪犯关着
and I'm being treated like a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.

781
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.520
你努力了  没人能否认这点
You tried. Nobody can say you didn't.

782
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.250
可在监狱里你还能救谁呢
But who are you going to save in prison?

783
00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.760
可能谁也救不了
Probably nobody.

784
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.850
那你为什么不能
Then why can't you just

785
00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.640
拿起那该死的枪让他们看看呢
pick up the stupid gun and wave it around?

786
00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.450
不是让你用枪杀人  只是妥协一点
You don't have to use it, just meet them halfway.

787
00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.720
-我不能  -你可以的  你只是太骄傲
- I can't do that. - Yes, you can. It's just pride.

788
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.770
骄傲又倔强  别让上帝影响你的想法
Pride and stubbornness. Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

789
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.730
我骄傲吗
Have I been prideful?

790
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.320
也许是吧
Maybe I am prideful.

791
00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.410
但如果我不能坚持自己的信仰
But I don't know how I'm going to live with myself

792
00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.720
我不知道该如何面对自己
if I don't stay true to what I believe.

793
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.240
更不知道怎么面对你
Much less how you could live with me.

794
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.760
那样我就不是你眼中的我了
I'd never be the man that I want to be in your eyes.

795
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:16.800
我爱你是因为你和别人都不一样
I fell in love with you because you weren't like anyone else

796
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.800
你也不曾试图跟他们一样
and you didn't try to be.

797
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:27.840
千万别觉得你会让我失望
Do not think for one moment that you will disappoint me.

798
00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.200
无论如何  我都爱你
I will love you no matter what.

799
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.880
我也不知道他会怎么做  不管怎样他都是输
I don't know what he's gonna do. He loses no matter what.

800
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.760
他们想让他认罪
They want him to plead guilty,

801
00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.000
那他就会被开除军籍
but then he'll get a dishonorable discharge.

802
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.680
要不就坚持  那肯定就会进监狱
Otherwise he fights them, and he for sure goes to prison.

803
00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.680
不论怎样  他们都认为他是懦夫
Either way, they'll call him a coward

804
00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.410
我不知道他怎么接受得了
and I don't see how he can live with that.

805
00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.560
谢谢  多萝西
Well, thank you, Dorothy.

806
00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.400
如果你能跟他说上话
If you get to talk to him,

807
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.720
告诉他  我们爱他  为他祈祷
tell him that we love him and that we're praying for him.

808
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.920
为你们两个祈祷
We're praying for both of you.

809
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.040
我会的  再见
I will. Bye-bye.

810
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.210
汤姆  你疯了吗
Tom, you're out of your mind, you're delirious.

811
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.760
我当然疯了
Of course, I'm out of my mind.

812
00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.650
你以为呢  我就是疯了
What do you think I am? I'm out of my mind.

813
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.600
你出去
You leave this room.

814
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.250
不  汤姆  放下枪
No, Tom! Put it down!

815
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:41.080
走开  你这个女人  
Get away from me, woman!

816
00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.450
我来吧  先生
I got that, sir.

817
00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.240
有什么可以帮您的  先生
May I help you, sir?

818
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.890
我想见默斯格罗夫准将
I wish to speak to Brigadier General Musgrove.

819
00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.500
预约过才可以
Not without an appointment you can't.

820
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.800
您不能见
That would be quite impossible.

821
00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.400
能不能麻烦你告诉他
Uh, if you would kindly tell him

822
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:31.280
托马斯·多斯下士想跟他说两句话
Corporal Thomas Doss would appreciate a brief word.

823
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:34.360
他在参加一个重要会议
He's in a very important meeting.

824
00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:38.490
我在法国北洛森林跟着他打过仗  他是队长
I fought with him in France at Belleau Wood. He was my captain.

825
00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.360
拜托了  女士  这事非常重要
Please, ma'am, it's most vital.

826
00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.000
谢谢你  女士
Thank you, ma'am.

827
00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.560
外面有个人找你  叫汤姆·多斯
There's a man out there, Tom Doss.

828
00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.040
多斯
Doss?

829
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.520
很快就结束了
Be over in a minute.

830
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:07.120
你可以像什么都没发生过一样回家了
You'll be home safe and sound, like nothing ever happened.

831
00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.680
我爱你
I love you.

832
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.690
这是关于二等兵戴斯蒙德·多斯的听证会
This is a hearing into the matter of Private Desmond Doss.

833
00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.290
罪名是违反上级的
The charge is disobeying a series of direct orders

834
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.560
一系列直接命令
from his commanding officer.

835
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.960
辩方有何观点
How says the defendant?

836
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:12.840
二等兵多斯想进行无罪辩护
Private Doss wishes to enter a "Not guilty" Plea.

837
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.600
是吗  我以为已经达成协议了
Is that so, Private? I thought this was agreed.

838
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.160
你要进行认罪求情呢
You wanted to enter some sort of plea bargain.

839
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.440
-是的  但我改变主意了  -是吗
- Yes, sir, but I changed my mind. - Just like that?

840
00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.210
你想上军事法庭
You wish to proceed to a court-martial?

841
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.490
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

842
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:32.720
那就随你吧  二等兵  继续
Well, on your head, then, Private. Proceed.

843
00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:40.290
法官大人  二等兵多斯用道德压我们
Your Honor, Private Doss waves his morality at us

844
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.480
好像那是他的荣耀勋章一样
like it's some kind of badge of honor.

845
00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.900
他公然蔑视
He flaunts his contempt by

846
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:46.240
违反了长官的
directly disobeying a series of direct orders

847
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.560
一系列直接命令
from his commanding officer.

848
00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.640
而我们的其他士兵
When the very best of our

849
00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.560
还在沙场上浴血奋战...
young men are sacrificing their lives against...

850
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.440
-你还好吗  -没事
- You okay? - Yes.

851
00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.170
他们还在审理吗
Are they still deliberating?

852
00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.440
是的
Yes, sir.

853
00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:01.280
好  你把这个拿进去
Okay, now you go take this in there.

854
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.170
不行  只有军队人员才能进入
I can't. It's strictly military personnel.

855
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.690
那就让他们帮忙拿进去
Well, then you get one of them to take it in.

856
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.000
他们不会帮忙的  他们恨不得直接埋了他
They ain't out to help. They're fixing to bury him.

857
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.640
任何军事法庭
There is only one question

858
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.520
都只需要问被告一个问题
that any military court need ask of the accused.

859
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.320
你是否否认违反了萨斯顿上校的直接命令
Do you deny disobeying Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

860
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.360
你否认吗  二等兵
Well, do you, Private?

861
00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.800
-不  我不否认  -那还有什么好争辩的呢
- No, sir. I don't. - Why are you contesting it, then?

862
00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:31.270
既然你都拒绝碰枪了
Why is it so important to you,

863
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:33.160
为什么在部队服役
given your refusal to even touch a weapon,

864
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.440
对你还那么重要呢
to serve in a combat unit?

865
00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.320
因为日本袭击珍珠港的时候
Because when the Japanese

866
00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.360
我很生气
attacked Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.

867
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:44.400
我身边的所有人都迫切想参军  包括我
Everyone I knew was on fire to join up, including me.

868
00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:52.760
我家乡有两个人被判定不适合服役
There were two men in my home town... declared 4-F unfit.

869
00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.360
他们为此而自杀了
They killed themselves because they couldn't serve.

870
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.440
我在国防工厂上班  本可以推迟服役
I had a job in a defense plant and I could've taken a deferment,

871
01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.850
但那是不对的
but that ain't right.

872
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.400
其他人可以战斗  牺牲
It isn't right that other men should fight and die,

873
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.080
而我在家安享太平是不对的
that I would just be sitting at home safe.

874
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.650
我必须参军
I need to serve.

875
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.290
我充满激情想做一个战地医护人员
I got the energy and the passion to serve as a medic.

876
01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.840
和其他人并肩作战  同样浴血沙场  只是
Right in the middle with the other guys. No less danger, just...

877
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.080
其他人夺取生命的时候  我是去救人性命
While everybody else is taking life, I'm going to be saving it.

878
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.800
当世界四分五裂的时候
With the world so set on tearing itself apart,

879
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.880
我觉得想努力把它拼凑起来
it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me

880
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.440
并没什么不对
to want to put a little bit of it back together.

881
01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.440
抱歉先生  任何人不得进入...
Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go...

882
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.600
不  你不明白  我儿子是被告
No, you don't understand. My son is the defendant.

883
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.250
我明白先生  但任何人都不能
I understand, sir, but nobody's allowed...

884
01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.620
我手上有很重要的信息
I have information that's important.

885
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.650
先生  您不能进
Sir, you are not allowed...

886
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.600
虽然表现出来的情感值得称赞
While the sentiments expressed are laudable,

887
01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.490
但是指控罪名看起来也无可辩驳  因此...
the facts of the charge seem incontestable, so...

888
01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.880
外面什么情况
What the hell is going on out there?

889
01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.290
放开他
Let him go.

890
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:15.480
-你穿的是一战的军装  -是的长官
- That's a Great War uniform. - It is, sir.

891
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.480
长官  这个必须给您
Sir, I need to show you this.

892
01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.680
但是  先生  你已经不是军人了
With respect, sir, you are no longer a member of the military.

893
01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.650
你不能参加听证会  抱歉
You are unable to attend this hearing. I'm sorry.

894
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.760
真是这样吗  长官
Is that truly the way it works, sir?

895
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.200
你为祖国而战
You fight for your country,

896
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.120
失去了那么多珍贵的东西
you lose so much that was dear to you,

897
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.120
然后你就被抛弃了吗
and then you're done with?

898
01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.520
军装被遗忘  你再也无力发声
The uniform is forgotten. You have no voice.

899
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.520
你在利斯河战斗过
You were at Lys?

900
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.760
是的  长官  还有贝洛森林
I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.

901
01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.370
两次授勋啊
Twice decorated, I see.

902
01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.320
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

903
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.840
我想你就是这位列兵的父亲吧
I take it you are the Private's father.

904
01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.800
是的  长官  托马斯·多斯
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

905
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.600
那么作为退役军人  你该明白法律规定
Then, as a former military man, you know there are laws here...

906
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.330
长官  我懂法  也知道我儿子也受其保护
Sir, I know the law and I know my son is protected by those laws.

907
01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.680
宪法中是这样规定的
They are framed in our constitution.

908
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.760
他也和我一样  信任这法律
And I believe in them, as he does.

909
01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.120
我上战场就是为它而战
They are why I went and fought to protect them.

910
01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.360
至少我以为是如此
At least, that is what I thought I was doing.

911
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.880
因为如果不是为此
Because if it wasn't for that,

912
01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.440
那我也不知道我是去为何而战了  长官
then I have no idea what the hell I was doing there, sir.

913
01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.560
谢谢  多斯下士
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

914
01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.170
把信给我吧
Let me have the letter.

915
01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.120
你必须离开了
You must go.

无人有权强迫他放弃他的权利
and he cannot be compelled to waive those rights.

上校
Colonel?

923
01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:07.760
-我撤销指控  长官  -那么案件驳回
- I withdraw the charges, sir. - Then this case is dismissed.

924
01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.160
二等兵多斯  你有权不携带任何
Private Doss, you are free to run into the hellfire of battle

925
01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.210
用以自保的武器冲上战场
without a single weapon to protect yourself.

926
01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.880
你将恢复原职  并开始军医培训
You may resume your duties and begin training as a combat medic.

-他在哪  -走了  直接走的

我求他留下  我说了你会想见他
I begged him to stay. I told him you'd want to see him.

929
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.680
没事  我理解
No, I understand.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.680
等你回家  告诉他我爱他
When you get home, you tell him I love him.

You just come off the line?

965
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.200

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.960
我问你那里什么样
I said, What's it like?

967
01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.290
钢锯岭
Hacksaw.

968
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.490
我们爬上去六次  被他们赶下来六次
We climbed up six times. Six times, they threw us off.

969
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.680
最后一次  96师几乎已经全军覆没
Last time, there wasn't anything left of the 96th.

970
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.000
他们是野兽
They're animals.

971
01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.040
肮脏的野兽
Stinking animals.

972
01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.280
日本鬼子不在乎生死
Nips don't care if they live or die.

973
01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.560
他们根本就是求死  毫不退缩
They want to die. They keep coming at you.

974
01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.210
而且决不放弃

975
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.770
绝不
Never.

976
01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.680
来  伙计
Here. Hey, buddy.

977
01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.400
日本人会故意以伤员为目标
The Japs deliberately target the wounded.

978
01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.480
把你的红十字标志都去掉
Lose all your Red Cross markings.

979
01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.800
日本鬼子优先瞄军医
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

980
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.330
白袖章等于标靶
The white is a bull's-eye.

981
01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.720
给你  新头盔
Here, I got you a new helmet.

982
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.410
均码的
One size fits all.

983
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.640
那里就是目标  钢锯岭
That's our objective. Hacksaw Ridge.

984
01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.400
占领它  也许就能攻占冲绳
We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.

985
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.480
占领冲绳  就能拿下日本
We get Okinawa, we take Japan.

986
01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.890
稍事休息  我们的海军兄弟
Take a breather. Our pals

987
01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.320
要帮我们给他们个下马威
in the Navy are going to soften them up for us.

988
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.320
那种炮火下无人能生还
Nobody can survive that shit.

989
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.400
但日本人可以
Oh, but they can.

990
01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:44.250
中尉  这几个碉堡的位置准确吗
Lieutenant, these bunkers here, here and here, is that accurate?

991
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.250
对  有三个...
Yeah, there's three...

992
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.880
准  长官  也许再后点  但...
Yes, sir, maybe a little further back, but it's all...

993
01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.520
但上去了就完全不一样了
It's all different up there.

994
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.360
安全  上尉
All clear, Captain.

995
01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.520
先生们  出发
Gents, move out.

996
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.290
是血
It's blood.

997
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.600
没错
No shit.

998
01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.480
我们不在堪萨斯了  小可爱
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

999

继续爬
Keep climbing.

1000
01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.520

Here, come on.

1001
01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.920
借过  让让  让开
Coming through, make way. Out of the way.

1002
01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.800
-布朗  -怎么了
- Brown. - What?

1003
01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.960
这个给杰索普
Give this to Jessop.

1004
01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.040
下士
Corporal!

1005
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.480

1008
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.680
他们到底在哪  什么也看不见
Where the hell are they? I can't see nothing.

1009

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.360
这边  快
Over here, now!

1115
01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:33.960
你这是要去哪  多斯
Where the hell are you going, Doss?

1116
01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.640
外面还有伤员呢  中士
Still more wounded out there, Sarge.

1117
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.370
我跟他一起
I'll go with him.

1118
01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:41.480
放聪明点  脑袋放低
Be smart. Keep your ears down.

1119
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.080
好了  找个地方吧
All right, let's find a spot.

1120
01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.090
雷纳利和亨利
Rinnelli and Henry dead

1121
01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:57.120
没到15分钟就死了  那么直接

1122
01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.560
直接死了
Straight off.

1123
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.850
彼得森  普派  斯坦福还有墨菲
Peterson, Popeye. Standford and Murphy.

1124
01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.010
还有佩吉和昂格尔

1125
01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.360
拉斯顿
Ralston.

1126
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.960
"和平年代  孩子为父母送终
"In peace, sons bury their fathers,

1127
01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.280
战争年代  白发人却要送黑发人"
in war, fathers bury their sons."

1128
01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.210
能不说丧气话了吗
You wanna stop spouting that crap, huh?

1129
01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.200
一点用没有
It don't help none.

1130
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.800
是啊  这句真没错  在这儿说是没用
Yeah, you got that right. Not here.

1131
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.170
给我
Hey, give me that.

1132
01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.880
这个腹部受伤
Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.

1133
01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.160
他需要输血
This man is going to need some plasma.

1134
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.600
-好的  -交给我们吧
- You got it. - Leave him with us.

1135
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.800
好的  没事了  有他们呢
Okay. You're okay now. They got you.

1136
01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.600
我们找个沙坑睡吧
Should we find a hole and dig in?

1137
01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.560
我看行
Sounds good to me.

1138
01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.440
头盔戴上
Put your helmet on.

1139
01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.890
你不吃吗
You ain't going to eat them?

1140
01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.880
我不吃肉  你自己吃吧
I don't eat meat. Help yourself.

1141
01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.680
就该想到你不吃肉
Of course you don't.

1142
01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.200
你女朋友真漂亮
That's one heck of a dame.

1143
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.800
你知道你根本
You know you're fighting

1144
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.760
配不上人家的  对吧
out of your weight class with her, don't you?

1145
01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.600
我知道
Yes, I do.

1146
01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.890
这话不能告诉她
Don't tell her that.

1147
01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.920
她跟我这样的人在一起才会更幸福
She'd be much happier with a man like me anyway.

1148
01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.960
是啊  直到她真正了解你
Yeah, until she got to know you.

1149
01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.640
有时候我真的挺混蛋
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1150
01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.320
只是有时候吗
Sometimes?

1151
01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.720
好吧好吧
Yeah, all right. All right.

1152
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.360
这些日本人很狡猾
These Japs are sneaky.

1153
01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.840
第一班我来守  你先睡会儿吧
I'll take first watch, all right? You get some shut-eye.

1154
01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.880
这梦肯定很可怕
Hell of a dream.

1155
01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:52.010
梦到我被烧焦了  什么也做不了
Dreamed I got myself skewered. I couldn't do nothing.

1156
01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.800
你手边就有枪
Rifle's just there.

1157
01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.120
枪不咬人的
It won't bite.

1158
01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.000
会的
Yeah, it will.

1159
01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.490
看看周围吧
Look around you.

1160
01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.840
经历了今天这一切
After what we've just been through,

1161
01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.960
任何没疯的人都会尖叫着要枪了
any sane man would be screaming for a weapon.

1162
01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.960
我从来没说过我没疯
I never claimed to be sane.

1163
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.680
我父亲酗酒
My daddy's a drunk.

1164
01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.050
他也尝试着戒了几十年  但就是戒不了
He fought it for years, but it kind of got a hold of him hard.

1165
01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.280
所以他脾气很坏
Made him mean.

1166
01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:29.640
至少你还认识你爸
Least you knew him.

1167
01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.420
有十个人都有可能是我爸
Mine could have been any one of 10 guys,

1168
01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.960
而且他们没一个是好东西...
and none of them worth a damn, so...

1169
01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.410
所以是你母亲把你养大的吗
So, your momma raised you?

1170
01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.560
我知道她是谁  但五岁时她就送我去了孤儿院
I knew her, but she gave me to an orphanage when I was five.

1171
01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.920
后来再没见过她
Never saw her again.

1172
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.840
很快我就学会了仇恨
I learned how to hate quick.

1173
01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:49.880
也学会了怎么快速判断人  但我看错了你
I learned how to judge people quicker, and I got you very wrong.

1174
01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.310
我爸以前经常打我和我哥
My daddy used to beat me

1175
01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.160
就因为太阳照常升起了
and my brother just because the sun rose,

1176
01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.360
然后因为太阳落山了又会抽我们
and then whip us just because it set.

1177
01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.330
这我可以忍受
I could take that...

1178
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:12.920
但当他打算那样对我们的母亲...
...but when he would do it to our momma...

1179
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.160
给我滚  你这个臭女人
Get away from me, woman!

1180
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.800
够了  别再这样了  你听见了吗
That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?

1181
01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:27.720
你开枪啊
Pull the damn trigger.

1182
01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:32.360
别  别开枪
Stop it! Stop!

1183
01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.720
但你并没杀他
But you didn't kill him?

1184
01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.320
在心里我已经开枪了
In my heart, I did.

1185
01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.720
所以我向上帝承诺
So that's why I made my promise to God,

1186
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.880
我再也不会碰枪
I ain't never going to touch a gun again.

1187
01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.080
我可不会把我的枪给你  你是个疯子
Well, I ain't giving you mine, 'cause you're crazy.

1188
01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.440
妈了个...
Son of a...

1189
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.360
妈了个逼
Son of a bitch.

1190
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.320
撤  快撤  赶紧过来
Move, move! Get your asses over here.

1191
01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.730
快走
Let's go!

1192
01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.600
退后  退后  快
Fall back, fall back! Go!

1193
01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.720
他们是从地道里上来的
They're coming from underground.

1194
01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:05.690
探照灯  这里是六号面包师

Request immediate support.

Target is Yoke-Tare-Five-One-Five.

1197
01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.680
是的  我知道我们在哪
Yes! Yes, I know that's where the hell we are,

1198
01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.400
但我们顶不了多久了
but I don't expect to be here much longer!

1199
01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.720
我已经请求了炮击支援
I called an artillery strike.

1200
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.480
撤退  快  快撤
Fall back. Move. Move!

1201
01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.120

He didn't make it. He died of shock. No plasma.

1407
02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.560
抱歉
Sorry.

1408
02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:03.720
过去我只看到个消瘦的孩子
All I saw was a skinny kid.

1409
02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:05.360
并不了解你是怎样的人
I didn't know who you were.

1410
02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:12.170
在报效国家这件事上
You've done more than any other man could have done

1411
02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:14.560
你比任何人做得都多
in the service of his country.

1412
02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:17.160
我之前对你的看法实在是大错特错
And I have never been more wrong about someone in my life.

1413
02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.760
我希望你有一天能够原谅我
I hope one day you can forgive me.

1414
02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:35.600
我们明天就要回去战斗
We have to go back up tomorrow.

1415
02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.970
我知道明天是你做祷告的日子
I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.

1416
02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:49.560
这里的大部分人都不像你那样有信仰
Most of these men don't believe the same way you do.

1417
02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.800
但是他们都相信你对自己的信仰有多坚定
But they believe so much in how much you believe.

1418
02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:01.850
你在那山脊上做的事  真可谓是奇迹
And what you did on that ridge, it's nothing short of a miracle,

1419
02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:03.680
他们也想被神迹福泽
and they want a piece of it.

1420
02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.680
只有你在他们才愿意上去奋战
And they're not going to go up there without you.

1421
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.770
你们在拖延什么呢  上尉
What the hell is your delay, Captain?

1422
02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:23.610
十分钟前就该进行攻击了
You were supposed to begin that assault 10 minutes ago!

1423
02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:26.450
-我们在等  长官  -等什么
- We're waiting, sir. - Waiting for what?

1424
02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:31.920
等二等兵多斯为我们祈祷完毕  长官
For Private Doss to finish praying for us, sir.

1425
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.650
二等兵多斯在为你们祈祷
Private Doss is praying for you?

1426
02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.520
这个二等兵多斯是什么人
Who the hell is Private Doss?

1427
02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.520
开始行动吧
Let's go to work.

1428
02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.320
趴下  趴下
Down. Get down!

1429
02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:57.760
趴在地上  趴地上  马上
Get on the ground. On the ground. Now!

1430
02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.360
躺下  躺下  我给你注射吗啡
Lay down, lay down. I got the morphine.

1431
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.920
快走  把这些人带出去
Let's go, let's get these men out of here.

1432
02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:52.680
我的圣经  圣经  圣经
My Bible... My Bible. My Bible...

1433
02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:55.520
停  停停停  停
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

1434
02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:58.120
我的圣经  圣经  圣经
My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.

1435
02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:00.080
好
Okay.

1436
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.440
你要回家了  戴斯蒙德
You're going home, Desmond.

1437
02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:19.400
我们把钢锯岭拿下了
We've taken Hacksaw.

1438
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.720
等下  等下  戴斯蒙德
Hold up, hold up! Desmond!

1439
02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.000
戴斯蒙德
Desmond.

1440
02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:49.030
戴斯蒙德·多斯在钢锯岭共救下七十五名伤兵

1441
02:08:49.650 --> 02:09:00.750
他是第一个拒服兵役但却获得荣誉勋章的士兵
这是美国战争的最高奖励

1442
02:09:03.290 --> 02:09:10.800
戴斯蒙德和多萝西结婚  相伴到1991年多萝西去世

1443
02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.470
他对自己的英雄事迹非常谦虚
并认为这都是上帝的指引

1444
02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:19.040
我那时候一直在祈祷
I was praying the whole time.

1445
02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:20.360
一直在祈祷
I just kept praying,

1446
02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:26.070
戴斯蒙德·多斯 - 2003

1447
02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:24.360
"主啊  请帮我再多救一个"
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1448
02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:26.900
当我又救了一个  我会说
When I got this, I said,

1449
02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:29.570
"主啊  请帮我再多救一个"
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1450
02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:34.570
他说"真正的英雄都被葬在这里了"

1451
02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:38.080
我想任何人都不该
I would say anyone is wrong

1452
02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:40.120
试图动摇他人的信仰
to try to compromise somebody's conviction.

1453
02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:46.920
哈尔·多斯

1454
02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:43.320
无论是在军队还是哪里
I don't care whether it's army or what it is.

1455
02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:47.800
当你心存信念  那可不是玩笑
When you own a conviction, that is not a joke.

1456
02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.850
那代表了你是怎样的人
That's what you are.

1457
02:09:51.420 --> 02:10:01.560
格洛弗上尉

1458
02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.560
尽管为了让他拿起枪
Even though I said those things to him

1459
02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:55.920
我对他说了那些话
in regard to carrying a rifle,

1460
02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.460
如果他不拿枪
then he would never be by

1461
02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:02.610
我永远不会与他并肩作战
my damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

1462
02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:05.570
但最终
But then, in the long run,

1463
02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.360
原来他才是活着的最勇敢的人之一
finding out that he was one of the bravest persons alive.

1464
02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:13.200
而且最终他救了我的命
And then to have him end up saving my life

1465
02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:16.440
真是整件事中最讽刺的一点
was the irony of the whole thing.

1466
02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:21.600
那个伙计的脸和眼睛上都是血
Blood had run down into the fella's face and eyes.

1467
02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:25.730
他躺在那里呻吟  向医疗兵求救
He was laying there just groaning and calling for a medic.

1468
02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.000
我从水壶里倒了些水
I took water from my canteen,

1469
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.080
又拿了些绷带  帮他洗了脸
got some bandage, and I washed his face.

1470
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.000
清洗过后  他的眼睛逐渐睁开
And when I... was washing his eyes, his eyes came open.

1471
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.760
天  他一下就有精神了
Man, he just lit up.

1472
02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:47.800
他说  "我还以为我瞎了"
He says, "I thought I was blind."

1473
02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:50.960
他的笑容是我在这场战争中
And if I hadn't got anything more out of the war

1474
02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:55.880
得到的最好回报  我很满足了
than that smile he gave me, I'd have been well repaid.

1475
02:10:57.530 --> 02:11:05.120
戴斯蒙德·多斯于2006年3月逝世
享年87岁
