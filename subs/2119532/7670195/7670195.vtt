00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.400
A TRUE STORY

4
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.901
Didn't you hear it?

5
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.469
An eternal God is the Lord....

6
00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.191
Creator of the ends of the earth.

7
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:57.812
He doesn't get tired, He doesn't get exhausted....

8
00:01:57.912 --> 00:02:00.876
His wisdom is unfathomable.

9
00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:11.010
He gives strength to the weary,
the powerless he gives power in abundance.

10
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.451
Young fighters get tired and exhausted....

11
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:20.151
but those who hope in the Lord receive new strength:

12
00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:24.823
They spread their wings like eagles....

13
00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:27.443
they run, but do not get exhausted....

14
00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:30.681
they walk, but don't get tired.

15
00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.582
Desmond, hang in there.

16
00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:42.347
Hang in there, Desmond. We're going to get you out of here.

BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, VIRGINIA

18
00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:55.146
SIXTEEN YEARS EARLIER

19
00:02:56.173 --> 00:02:59.977
Desmond.

20
00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:02.589
What?
- Now wait.

21
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.870
Walk on.
- Just wait. I have to tell you something.

22
00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:12.092
What then, Hal?

23
00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:16.122
Whoever gets to the top first.
- Cheater.

24
00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:27.621
See you later, slugger.

25
00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.374
Should I help?
- I'll manage.

26
00:03:43.742 --> 00:03:45.686
Sit down.
- Stop.

27
00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:47.096
Stop yourself.

28
00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:53.003
For heaven's sake.

29
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.393
Get away from the edge.
You're going to break your necks.

30
00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:03.725
Those are the Doss brothers.
Just as crazy as their dad.

31
00:04:12.187 --> 00:04:15.548
They are on the corner of Jackson and Main
digging.

32
00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.501
They are laying a sidewalk.

33
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:25.102
You would not know it again.

34
00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:34.557
And I doubt they would recognize you.

35
00:04:36.657 --> 00:04:39.846
They barely recognize me when I walk past them.

36
00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:44.669
Like I died with you.

37
00:04:49.943 --> 00:04:52.595
As if we never existed.

38
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.513
That's all I have for you today.

39
00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:26.989
Block him with the right, Desmond.

40
00:05:27.524 --> 00:05:29.734
Stop it. Do you guys hear me?

41
00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:33.457
Why do they fight?
- Do they need a reason for that?

42
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.900
Tom, do...

43
00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:39.897
Why should I stop them? Now all I have to do
give the one who wins a beating.

44
00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:51.730
Wake up. Can you hear me?
- What have you done?

45
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:53.281
He doesn't hear me.

46
00:05:55.886 --> 00:05:57.452
I'll get some ice cream.

47
00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:03.102
Can you put that basket away?
- I will.

48
00:06:04.202 --> 00:06:05.672
Is he still breathing?

49
00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:09.702
Hal? Hal, can you hear me?

50
00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:27.007
He has dilated pupils.

51
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:52.904
What are you working on?

52
00:06:53.804 --> 00:06:59.804
You're going to get a beating. You know the rules.

53
00:07:00.804 --> 00:07:03.104
Do you hear me, Desmond?

54
00:07:03.204 --> 00:07:04.704
SIXTH GOD
THOU SHALT NOT KILL

55
00:07:05.782 --> 00:07:11.222
Hold on. What will he learn from that?
He's fierce enough already.

56
00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:17.564
Just smother him with kisses. Tell him
That the world is a tender and sweet place.

57
00:07:21.928 --> 00:07:24.005
Hal will be fine.

58
00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:44.237
I could have beaten him to death.
- Yes, you could have.

59
00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:47.628
Murder is the greatest sin.

60
00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:53.028
Taking someone's life,
is the greatest sin in God's eyes.

61
00:07:53.128 --> 00:07:55.728
Nothing hurts Him anymore.

62
00:07:56.805 --> 00:08:01.215
Don't you understand English?
Do I have to say it again?

63
00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:05.601
Otherwise, I'll kick your ass....
- What's going on in there? Are you all right, Bertha?

64
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:09.286
Mind your own business.
- Don't take it out on...

65
00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.324
I hate it.

66
00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:28.662
Mama?

67
00:08:41.362 --> 00:08:43.973
Why does he hate us so much?

68
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.504
He doesn't hate us.

69
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:53.204
He hates himself. Sometimes.

70
00:08:54.404 --> 00:08:57.004
Your father was not himself tonight.

71
00:08:58.304 --> 00:09:01.904
I wish you would know him
As I knew him before the war.

72
00:09:02.473 --> 00:09:05.901
praise the Lord, praise the Lord....

73
00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:11.693
FIFTEEN YEARS LATER

74
00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:29.106
How did we sound, Desmond?
- Like heavenly angels, ma.

75
00:09:29.215 --> 00:09:32.594
You know lying is a sin,
especially in this place.

76
00:09:32.787 --> 00:09:35.355
I didn't say they were singing angels.

77
00:09:40.755 --> 00:09:43.024
What's going on there?

78
00:09:43.175 --> 00:09:44.776
Lift.

79
00:09:47.596 --> 00:09:49.590
Drag it out from under it. Just the rug.

80
00:09:54.873 --> 00:09:59.395
I call an ambulance.
- No time. Joshua's pickup. Quickly.

81
00:10:14.295 --> 00:10:16.095
LYNCHBURG HOSPITAL

82
00:10:17.318 --> 00:10:20.930
You'll be fine. You're in good hands.

83
00:10:23.142 --> 00:10:26.580
What do we have here?
A severed artery. Get the sutures.

84
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.767
Keep pressing it.
Did you apply this tourniquet?

85
00:10:30.084 --> 00:10:32.327
Well done.
You saved this boy's life.

86
00:10:33.322 --> 00:10:35.949
Will you stay with us? You'll be fine again.

87
00:10:36.092 --> 00:10:39.003
What's your name?
- Gilbert.

88
00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:43.801
Operate?
- Yes. Stay with us. You'll be fine.

89
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:53.055
The army inspection is there. Blood is given here.

90
00:11:58.973 --> 00:12:00.398
Are you okay?

91
00:12:02.017 --> 00:12:05.416
Oh, that's not mine. I don't have anything.

92
00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:08.016
Still, thanks for asking.

93
00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:14.324
What do you need?

94
00:12:16.386 --> 00:12:17.715
My belt.

95
00:12:20.715 --> 00:12:23.615
I lent it to the boy
who had that accident.

96
00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:26.415
My pants don't stay on anymore.

97
00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:29.987
I don't have your belt.

98
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.691
No, I know that. It's still there with that boy.

99
00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:39.323
I'm just taking blood here.
- I'm willing to give some too.

100
00:12:42.034 --> 00:12:45.230
Go to that room and wait with the others.
I will call you.

101
00:12:50.646 --> 00:12:51.847
That room.

102
00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:02.502
Have you given blood before, Mr....

103
00:13:04.096 --> 00:13:05.286
Doss.

104
00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:09.386
My friends call me Desmond.
No, this is the first time.

105
00:13:10.986 --> 00:13:13.086
RARE BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA

106
00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:20.970
I always dreamed of
of becoming a doctor...

107
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.570
but I didn't have much school.

108
00:13:25.641 --> 00:13:30.175
You may get a little dizzy.
Will you be picked up?

109
00:13:30.948 --> 00:13:34.768
No, I'm going to walk back.
- Where do you live?

110
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.923
Fort Hill.
- That's quite a distance.

111
00:13:38.048 --> 00:13:40.345
Eight to ten kilometers.

112
00:13:40.845 --> 00:13:44.472
I go through the forest, then it's almost twelve.

113
00:13:45.374 --> 00:13:48.744
Then you must really like the forest.
- I certainly do.

114
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.759
Keep pressing this.

115
00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:55.059
Is it going?
- Yes.

116
00:13:59.584 --> 00:14:02.888
Where do you go dressed up like this?

117
00:14:03.063 --> 00:14:04.669
I met someone yesterday.

118
00:14:04.769 --> 00:14:07.569
A nurse, Dorothy Schutte.
I'm going to marry her.

119
00:14:07.736 --> 00:14:11.465
Does she know this herself?
- Not yet, but she will soon.

120
00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:15.771
Have you ever talked to a woman?
One who is not a relative?

121
00:14:15.913 --> 00:14:17.180
Talked to her.

122
00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:21.469
In that case... Come give your brother a hug.

123
00:14:21.654 --> 00:14:23.660
Get rid of those fat claws.

124
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.035
Wish me luck, Ma.

125
00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:28.335
Success.

126
00:15:05.518 --> 00:15:06.735
Next.

127
00:15:06.894 --> 00:15:09.923
Sit down. Have you given blood before?

128
00:15:10.107 --> 00:15:11.525
Yes.

129
00:15:14.387 --> 00:15:17.515
You are that man of the belt.
- Desmond.

130
00:15:17.658 --> 00:15:20.379
Desmond, you can't
give blood two days in a row.

131
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.557
Nice. I've come to take mine back.
- Excuse me, sir?

132
00:15:23.733 --> 00:15:25.350
My blood. I want it back.

133
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:29.173
That's not how it works.
We can't just give it back.

134
00:15:29.323 --> 00:15:35.050
You have to. Ever since you stuck me
with that syringe, my heart has been racing.

135
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.050
Every time I think of you,
it makes it tick even more.

136
00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:42.798
I didn't know that one yet. Pretty banal.

137
00:15:42.965 --> 00:15:44.290
Really?

138
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.790
Too bad. I've been practicing on that all night.

139
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.490
Not good?

140
00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:53.052
I didn't say that.

141
00:16:13.171 --> 00:16:16.315
What is the difference
between an artery and a vein?

142
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.631
What are you talking about?
- The accident of that boy.

143
00:16:23.935 --> 00:16:25.702
Arteries squirt blood.

144
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.640
And veins?

145
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.493
Bleeding.

146
00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:38.493
I think you should practice at home on your
boy-girl conversation should practice.

147
00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:40.221
Probably so.

148
00:16:42.224 --> 00:16:44.768
I do have a book for you,
if you're so interested.

149
00:16:46.154 --> 00:16:47.539
About dating?

150
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.626
About blood.

151
00:16:53.726 --> 00:16:55.326
PRELUDE TO WAR

152
00:16:58.762 --> 00:17:01.406
Another medical question?

153
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.811
No, I just think you're the most beautiful
I've ever seen.

154
00:17:06.296 --> 00:17:08.440
That's because I'm in the dark.

155
00:17:11.411 --> 00:17:12.549
No...

156
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:15.757
you are just gorgeous.

157
00:17:40.407 --> 00:17:41.824
On the side.

158
00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:46.196
You have to be careful where you walk.

159
00:17:57.945 --> 00:18:00.189
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd mind.

160
00:18:00.683 --> 00:18:02.192
You didn't ask.

161
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:06.748
I thought you'd like it.
- Maybe I would, if you had asked.

162
00:18:17.437 --> 00:18:18.738
Are you coming?

163
00:18:21.317 --> 00:18:23.269
Be careful where you walk.

164
00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:46.443
Why didn't you say anything?

165
00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:49.487
Because you would try to talk me out of it.
I know I'm doing the right thing.

166
00:18:49.605 --> 00:18:53.700
What about His commandment?
- In war it is not to kill.

167
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.800
It's protect. A lot of guys from our church go.

168
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.500
There is war, and they need people.

169
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.200
Working in a paper mill
is not going to save this country.

170
00:19:10.776 --> 00:19:14.820
Looks like a movie star, our boy.

171
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.717
Nice uniform, good cap.

172
00:19:24.217 --> 00:19:28.597
Reminds me of Artie Giddens,
when we went to France.

173
00:19:30.422 --> 00:19:31.922
Do you remember him?
- Don't.

174
00:19:35.064 --> 00:19:38.605
I'm just saying
how good Artie looked in his uniform.

175
00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:42.230
At least you girls thought so.

176
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.435
They came to him in droves,
and he was proud of that.

177
00:19:51.133 --> 00:19:54.839
I just hope that when Hal
gets shot, it's from the front.

178
00:19:55.739 --> 00:19:58.643
Like a regular gunshot wound, not much mess.

179
00:19:59.143 --> 00:20:05.243
Artie was shot in the back.
His intestines came out the front.

180
00:20:07.743 --> 00:20:10.243
His entire uniform went down.

181
00:20:13.906 --> 00:20:19.252
Fortunately, he was dead and never found out
how awful his uniform looked.

182
00:20:23.331 --> 00:20:25.000
Disappear from my eyes.

183
00:21:24.142 --> 00:21:26.453
Are you half climbing goat?

184
00:21:28.146 --> 00:21:32.942
Are you gonna help me, Desmond Doss,
or are you going to leave me here?

185
00:21:37.089 --> 00:21:40.350
I'll help you, for a price.
- What then?

186
00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:42.669
A kiss.

187
00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:50.199
That is pure blackmail.
- Yes, but that is the condition.

188
00:21:52.199 --> 00:21:53.599
That's the deal.

189
00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:56.699
I'm going to hold you to that.

190
00:22:09.562 --> 00:22:11.220
Wait a minute.

191
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:18.020
You're not going to hit me, are you?
Because if I fall, I'll drag you down with me.

192
00:22:18.655 --> 00:22:20.581
Kiss me, and you'll know.

193
00:22:52.681 --> 00:22:56.681
HANDBOOK OF PRACTICAL ANATOMY

194
00:23:09.581 --> 00:23:10.772
What?

195
00:23:11.874 --> 00:23:13.697
I need to be employed.

196
00:23:14.897 --> 00:23:17.697
I can't stay here,
while they all go and fight for me.

197
00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:21.964
You can.
- I have to. I want to be a medic.

198
00:23:22.064 --> 00:23:24.511
Then I save people, instead of killing them.

199
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.651
I have to work. I'm going to be late.

200
00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:37.574
Dorothy, honey. Dorothy.

201
00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.514
Are you going to ask me to marry you now?

202
00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.021
I don't know. Do you still want me then?
- I don't know. You didn't ask.

203
00:23:50.538 --> 00:23:52.504
I ask.

204
00:23:53.904 --> 00:23:59.455
With all my heart. Will you marry me?
- Then, yes, I will.

205
00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:11.936
When.
- As soon as you get leave.

206
00:24:12.036 --> 00:24:14.336
But I don't like you right now.

207
00:24:17.672 --> 00:24:19.225
But I do love you.

208
00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.323
Ma said I should come here to you.

209
00:24:39.823 --> 00:24:42.023
Those three were my best friends.

210
00:24:43.223 --> 00:24:45.023
I grew up with them.

211
00:24:45.923 --> 00:24:48.723
Got into trouble together,
chasing girls together.

212
00:24:49.123 --> 00:24:50.723
And joined together in service.

213
00:24:52.823 --> 00:24:54.623
Now my friends are lying there.

214
00:24:56.423 --> 00:24:59.923
Covered with earth and grass, eaten by worms.

215
00:25:02.523 --> 00:25:05.023
I don't want to come and see my sons here.

216
00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:08.823
Dad, I've already signed up.

217
00:25:11.323 --> 00:25:13.823
I couldn't help myself.

218
00:25:14.823 --> 00:25:18.104
All those others do...
- You are not like those others.

219
00:25:20.104 --> 00:25:26.104
All those others dive in without thinking,
just like the fools we were.

220
00:25:27.004 --> 00:25:31.004
The soldiers who stay alive,
stay alive because they can. You don't.

221
00:25:31.804 --> 00:25:34.504
You have to start thinking and praying about everything.

222
00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.715
Just look, you're doing it now too.

223
00:25:38.815 --> 00:25:43.138
You won't be able to live with yourself if you go.
- No, I won't be able to if I don't go.

224
00:25:43.238 --> 00:25:44.838
I'm going to be a medic.

225
00:25:45.638 --> 00:25:49.586
That's going to be my way of serving.
- There you go again, thinking about it.

226
00:25:50.186 --> 00:25:54.786
Do you think that war is going to
to you? To your ideas?

227
00:25:55.412 --> 00:25:57.806
No doubt it will be very tough.

228
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.979
It's not going to be tough, it's going to be impossible.

229
00:26:02.779 --> 00:26:09.206
Whatever is going on in your crazy head,
it's not gonna be like that. It doesn't work that way.

230
00:26:09.806 --> 00:26:15.506
And should you by some miracle survive ,
you won't thank God for it.

231
00:26:20.506 --> 00:26:25.866
Breakup. Come on, guys, you're now
from Uncle Sam. Say hello to your mother.

232
00:26:26.866 --> 00:26:31.356
Come on. Ladies, please move away from that bus.
- Almost forgot.

233
00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:35.756
Should I get a crowbar?
- Here. This is for you.

234
00:26:35.856 --> 00:26:37.356
That one is mine.

235
00:26:39.156 --> 00:26:42.856
Keep it there, where I will be.

236
00:26:53.139 --> 00:26:54.443
I love you.

237
00:26:58.812 --> 00:27:00.512
BIBLE

238
00:27:10.612 --> 00:27:14.595
COME BACK TO ME, DESMOND DOSS
I LOVE YOU

239
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.708
Sorry, mate.

240
00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:47.974
Do I have to look at your deformity every time
when I walk to my bed?

241
00:27:48.074 --> 00:27:50.674
Look at it with envy, my friend.

242
00:27:51.924 --> 00:27:54.643
What's up? You look lost.

243
00:27:54.743 --> 00:27:56.443
This one is still free.

244
00:27:56.575 --> 00:28:00.001
Wise Decision. Views of the mountains and lake.

245
00:28:00.501 --> 00:28:01.696
Randall Fuller.

246
00:28:03.139 --> 00:28:05.741
Desmond Doss.
- Just call him Teach, the teacher.

247
00:28:05.841 --> 00:28:09.466
Nobody understands what he is talking about.
- Because nobody here can read.

248
00:28:09.566 --> 00:28:12.666
Those testicles belong to someone
who calls himself Hollywood.

249
00:28:12.774 --> 00:28:15.768
They look like they belong to a smaller man.

250
00:28:19.346 --> 00:28:21.357
I just got those shoes.

251
00:28:23.309 --> 00:28:26.068
Grease Nolan, from Red Hook. Where are you from?
- Virginia.

252
00:28:26.168 --> 00:28:28.821
A country bumpkin. Did you marry your cousin?

253
00:28:29.621 --> 00:28:32.821
Joke, joke.

254
00:28:32.921 --> 00:28:36.590
That's Smitty kicking Kirzinski's ass.
- Like you're any better, you owl.

255
00:28:36.757 --> 00:28:40.251
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
- Paul Kirzinski, nice to meet you.

256
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.504
Hey, beanstalk, what was your name again?

257
00:28:43.664 --> 00:28:45.089
Desmond Doss.

258
00:28:47.042 --> 00:28:50.249
That's Tex Lewis, who thinks he's a cowboy.

259
00:28:50.349 --> 00:28:54.249
And Vito Rinnelli. He may be small,
but he's a bulldog.

260
00:28:54.424 --> 00:28:56.075
How's it going?
- Desmond.

261
00:28:56.802 --> 00:28:59.570
The handsome guy here is Lucky Ford.

262
00:28:59.763 --> 00:29:02.432
That's Walker and Pinnick,
pretending to play cards.

263
00:29:02.566 --> 00:29:06.377
A tune down, Grease.
- Or you should let your money speak for you.

264
00:29:09.338 --> 00:29:12.261
Good book, right?

265
00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:16.061
Lucky also has a good book. Don't you, Lucky?

266
00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:17.597
Reads well.

267
00:29:18.657 --> 00:29:20.950
Give eight.

268
00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:26.038
Entrance. Come on, hurry up.

269
00:29:56.127 --> 00:30:00.798
You are a very strange
looking individual, soldier. Name?

270
00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:04.201
Andy Walker.
- How long have you been dead?

271
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:08.895
Sir?
- I'm not a "sir," I'm Sergeant Howell.

272
00:30:08.995 --> 00:30:11.295
'Sir' is what you say to useless people.

273
00:30:13.295 --> 00:30:16.439
So your name is Ghoul, creep?
- Walker, sergeant.

274
00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:19.149
Ghoul, that is.
- Yes, sergeant.

275
00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:38.825
There's something wrong with your display, soldier.
I don't know exactly what.

276
00:30:39.925 --> 00:30:44.825
Is it your hair? Is it the crease in your pants?

277
00:30:44.925 --> 00:30:46.894
There's a knife in my foot, sergeant.

278
00:30:47.537 --> 00:30:51.042
Yes, of course. That's it, that knife.

279
00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:52.963
What's your name, soldier?
- Smitty Ryker.

280
00:30:53.063 --> 00:30:56.529
No, your name is Private Idiot.
Do you know why?

281
00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:59.649
Because there's a knife in my foot.
- Who threw that knife, soldier?

282
00:30:59.815 --> 00:31:04.847
It was an accident. We were playing stretch.
- Very nice that you didn't do it on purpose.

283
00:31:04.947 --> 00:31:11.034
Who threw that knife?
- It was me, sergeant. Private Kirzinski.

284
00:31:11.186 --> 00:31:14.663
You seem to be part Indian. What tribe do you belong to?

285
00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:19.310
No, I'm Polish.
- Wrong, there's Cherokee or Shawnee in your blood.

286
00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:22.988
No, sergeant.
- Are you contradicting me, covered wagon mollifying bastard?

287
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.075
No, sergeant.
- Let me see your Indian war cry.

288
00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:27.401
I don't know...

289
00:31:28.501 --> 00:31:30.701
If so, please show.

290
00:31:31.972 --> 00:31:35.370
What is your totem animal? Are you a garter snake?
- No, sergeant.

291
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.339
Are you a cheeky squirrel?
- No, sergeant.

292
00:31:37.439 --> 00:31:39.717
Are you a dancing reindeer?
- No, sergeant.

293
00:31:39.817 --> 00:31:42.330
Are you contradicting me, soldier?
- No, sergeant.

294
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:46.493
Nice. Then I will call you Chief from now on.

295
00:31:46.593 --> 00:31:49.223
As a sign of great respect for your people.

296
00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:51.916
Thank you, sergeant.

297
00:31:52.893 --> 00:31:55.245
Are you grinning
Or is that your natural expression?

298
00:31:55.329 --> 00:31:56.939
No, sergeant.
- Name, soldier?

299
00:31:57.106 --> 00:31:58.273
Desmond Doss.

300
00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:01.639
I have seen corn stalks with better physicality.

301
00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:03.904
I get the urge to rip off an ear.

302
00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:06.131
Can you stand your ground?
- Yes, sergeant.

303
00:32:06.231 --> 00:32:08.399
Won't be a problem for you.

304
00:32:08.551 --> 00:32:12.972
Corporal, keep this man out of the wind.
- Yes, sergeant.

305
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:20.086
Soldier Idiot, lift your foot. Higher.

306
00:32:21.271 --> 00:32:25.628
Everyone out, now. Walking.

307
00:32:26.928 --> 00:32:29.288
I said walk.
- Just putting on my uniform, sergeant.

308
00:32:29.472 --> 00:32:32.216
Did I ask him that, corporal?
- Not that I know of, sergeant.

309
00:32:32.407 --> 00:32:38.470
A man who is so proud of his natural state
will certainly appreciate the fresh air outside.

310
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:42.770
And now run with those noble parts,
soldier parts. Walk.

311
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.670
Exhibitionist Youth.

312
00:32:46.739 --> 00:32:49.892
I'm going to teach you the bowline knot....

313
00:32:49.992 --> 00:32:53.288
so you can get your lazy asses
to climb down from something...

314
00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:55.388
After which I can give it a kick.

315
00:32:55.514 --> 00:33:00.600
Make a loop. This is the rabbit hole.
The rabbit comes out of the hole....

316
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:04.300
Runs around the tree and crawls back into the den.

317
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.100
Obvious? Begin.

318
00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:12.592
Very good, Tex. Keep going, Teach.

319
00:33:13.692 --> 00:33:16.392
Have you ever caught a goat with a lasso?
- No, sergeant.

320
00:33:16.544 --> 00:33:18.804
Ever look a goat in the eye?
- No, Sarge.

321
00:33:18.904 --> 00:33:20.680
Nice. That wouldn't be normal.

322
00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.184
You know you die if you don't breathe.

323
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.179
Well, Private Idiot.

324
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:34.653
Congratulations, you fell 15 meters
down and broke your neck.

325
00:33:35.846 --> 00:33:40.792
Brilliant, Private Vito Rinnelli.
You strangled yourself, sucker.

326
00:33:40.893 --> 00:33:44.256
Are you a fan of Benito? Slightly longer.

327
00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:46.330
If you were American, you would be taller.

328
00:33:50.485 --> 00:33:54.159
What do we got here, Doss? One for each tit?

329
00:33:54.659 --> 00:33:58.359
You need to make a bowline knot, not a bra.

330
00:34:00.579 --> 00:34:03.014
What's so funny, corporal?
- No idea, sergeant.

331
00:34:05.584 --> 00:34:08.746
Come on, ladies, tackle. Walk, walk.

332
00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:12.969
I want to see fire, hurry up. Show me some.

333
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:16.569
Run like you mean it. Downhill, faster.

334
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:20.769
Hurry up. It's time for the bath, boys.

335
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:26.641
Hurry up, hurry up. I want to see you work.

336
00:34:26.741 --> 00:34:29.941
Also behind your ears. Shoot.

337
00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:33.327
You must be enjoying this, naked pervert.

338
00:34:33.428 --> 00:34:36.820
Hurry up, hurry up. Run.

339
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.020
What are you waiting for. Move along.

340
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.840
To the wood. Beware of splinters.

341
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.287
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

342
00:34:52.573 --> 00:34:54.861
Hurry up, guys. Run!

343
00:34:55.561 --> 00:34:58.561
What's wrong with you guys?
Nobody said you could rest.

344
00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:02.461
Hurry up to the finish line. Hurry up.

345
00:35:03.061 --> 00:35:07.461
Hurry up. Hurry, over that line.

346
00:35:09.314 --> 00:35:11.265
Well done, Doss.

347
00:35:18.056 --> 00:35:22.471
This is a gift from the U.S. government
to each and every one of you.

348
00:35:22.571 --> 00:35:26.971
The American standard rifle,
caliber .30, M1.

349
00:35:27.071 --> 00:35:30.171
A semiautomatic shoulder weapon with magazine...

350
00:35:30.271 --> 00:35:34.171
designed to bring death and destruction
among the enemy.

351
00:35:34.323 --> 00:35:38.963
This will be your lover, your mistress,
your concubine.

352
00:35:39.063 --> 00:35:42.863
Maybe the only thing in this life
that you are really going to love.

353
00:35:43.248 --> 00:35:46.474
Guys, we're going to dance. Grab a girl.

354
00:35:47.674 --> 00:35:51.674
Don't point your gun forward.
I don't want to get shot today....

355
00:35:51.774 --> 00:35:56.274
no matter how great the temptation.
Place the weapon at your side.

356
00:35:58.274 --> 00:35:59.474
Notice.

357
00:36:07.288 --> 00:36:10.986
Problem, Private Corn Stalk?
Isn't there one of your size among them?

358
00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:14.328
Or don't you like the color?
- No, sergeant.

359
00:36:16.906 --> 00:36:19.692
I was told I did not have to carry a weapon.

360
00:36:20.469 --> 00:36:23.646
Take a step forward, soldier.
I don't think I heard it right.

361
00:36:29.143 --> 00:36:30.721
I'm sorry, sergeant.

362
00:36:32.521 --> 00:36:34.181
I can't touch a gun.

363
00:36:37.318 --> 00:36:40.875
What's the problem?
- No problem, just a mistake.

364
00:36:40.975 --> 00:36:44.995
I said, when I signed up.
- It's not possible.

365
00:36:45.095 --> 00:36:47.954
Do you know why that's not possible?

366
00:36:48.146 --> 00:36:50.989
Because the U.S. military doesn't make mistakes.

367
00:36:51.149 --> 00:36:55.460
So if there's a problem ,
then you must be the problem.

368
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:58.864
I would not be sent to a militia company
be sent.

369
00:36:58.965 --> 00:37:00.966
He is an E.G.

370
00:37:05.288 --> 00:37:09.283
You are a Certified Conscientious Objector
Who has entered the workforce?

371
00:37:09.433 --> 00:37:13.904
No, I am an approved employee.

372
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:19.594
Are you kidding me, Doss?
- No, I volunteered.

373
00:37:19.694 --> 00:37:24.694
I don't mind wearing my uniform,
saluting the flag and doing my duty...

374
00:37:24.794 --> 00:37:29.194
but to carry a gun and kill people.

375
00:37:30.038 --> 00:37:33.382
You don't kill. That's all?
- Yes, that's all.

376
00:37:33.524 --> 00:37:37.011
You do know that quite a bit
killed in a war?

377
00:37:37.153 --> 00:37:40.831
That is the essential nature of war.

378
00:37:40.965 --> 00:37:42.115
Well then.

379
00:37:43.015 --> 00:37:45.815
Do you have any other conditions
for the U.S. military?

380
00:37:46.315 --> 00:37:49.615
Is there anything else we can do
to make your stay enjoyable?

381
00:37:49.733 --> 00:37:52.596
He doesn't want to work on Saturday, captain.

382
00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:56.993
On Saturday... I am a Seventh-day Adventist.

383
00:37:57.593 --> 00:38:00.993
Saturday is my Sabbath,
so I can't work then.

384
00:38:01.094 --> 00:38:03.741
That won't be a problem. Or will it, sergeant?

385
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:08.341
We ask the enemy if they don't want to invade then
invade, because Private Doss is praying.

386
00:38:09.368 --> 00:38:15.311
That's cleared up then.
I will tell you what my terms are.

387
00:38:15.411 --> 00:38:18.711
Those are not as complicated as yours,
they're very simple.

388
00:38:19.795 --> 00:38:25.097
As long as you are in this company under my command,
you will follow my orders. Item.

389
00:38:26.797 --> 00:38:30.497
If you can't do that here, I can't
trust that you can do so in battle.

390
00:38:35.311 --> 00:38:39.091
I sign you up for S5, mental instability.

391
00:38:40.191 --> 00:38:41.291
Dismissed.

392
00:38:42.051 --> 00:38:46.345
Gentlemen, meet Private Desmond Doss.

393
00:38:46.845 --> 00:38:51.045
By all accounts,
Private Doss does not believe in violence.

394
00:38:51.145 --> 00:38:55.445
He does not practice violence,
he will not even touch a weapon.

395
00:38:56.121 --> 00:39:00.885
Private Doss is, in fact
a Recognized Conscientious Objector.

396
00:39:01.029 --> 00:39:06.631
So don't expect him
that he will save you on the battlefield....

397
00:39:06.731 --> 00:39:12.331
because he will be busy wrestling with his conscience
wrestling and will not be able to help.

398
00:39:12.515 --> 00:39:15.884
Sergeant, that's not true.
- Soldier, recover.

399
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.595
I can imagine that some of you
might have some thoughts on this.

400
00:39:22.695 --> 00:39:24.995
That's what we men are fighting for.

401
00:39:25.095 --> 00:39:29.395
To defend our rights
And to protect our women and children.

402
00:39:29.995 --> 00:39:35.595
Even though Private Doss' faith can cause
women and children to die.

403
00:39:36.121 --> 00:39:42.549
So I expect everyone in this company
to give him the respect he deserves....

404
00:39:43.049 --> 00:39:45.449
during the short period he is with us.

405
00:39:46.149 --> 00:39:49.578
Am I clear?
- Yes, sergeant.

406
00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.933
What have you got there, Dessie?

407
00:40:04.144 --> 00:40:06.628
You know what that is.
- It's so small.

408
00:40:07.328 --> 00:40:10.461
Half a Bible for half a man.
- Smitty, give him back his Bible.

409
00:40:10.603 --> 00:40:12.321
I don't think I was talking to you.

410
00:40:16.563 --> 00:40:20.239
Why don't you fight?
Do you think you are better than us?

411
00:40:21.106 --> 00:40:22.281
No.

412
00:40:22.857 --> 00:40:24.415
And what if you are attacked?

413
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:29.308
Like this.

414
00:40:30.292 --> 00:40:32.626
According to the Bible, you're supposed to
turn the other cheek?

415
00:40:34.943 --> 00:40:39.846
I think this has nothing to do with faith.
I think this is cowardice.

416
00:40:40.446 --> 00:40:43.346
No more and no less. Or is it not, Doss?

417
00:40:44.246 --> 00:40:46.246
Are you a coward?

418
00:40:47.905 --> 00:40:51.215
Do it. Hit it.

419
00:40:52.215 --> 00:40:56.115
You can hit once for free. Here.

420
00:40:57.449 --> 00:41:00.065
Hit me, Doss. Go ahead.

421
00:41:00.165 --> 00:41:02.084
Hit it.

422
00:41:02.217 --> 00:41:03.409
Don't you?

423
00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:06.909
Coward.

424
00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:13.828
What is this?
- Enter here.

425
00:41:13.953 --> 00:41:16.192
This is a very pretty girl.

426
00:41:16.292 --> 00:41:17.546
Pass on.

427
00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:21.848
This is a gal who deserves a real man.

428
00:41:23.473 --> 00:41:24.923
Enter here.

429
00:41:25.891 --> 00:41:27.049
"Please.

430
00:41:28.624 --> 00:41:32.358
Please.
- 'Please give it back, Smitty'.

431
00:41:33.001 --> 00:41:35.109
Please give it back, Smitty.

432
00:41:45.296 --> 00:41:47.537
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

433
00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.247
No, sir.

434
00:41:52.398 --> 00:41:57.807
But is it true that God is talking to you?
- I'm not crazy.

435
00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:02.508
Does it feel that way?
That most people think you're crazy.

436
00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:05.384
I know I'm different, but....

437
00:42:07.484 --> 00:42:10.878
I'm not going to pretend to be somebody else.
I am what I am.

438
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:14.662
Sounds lonely. Are you lonely?

439
00:42:19.321 --> 00:42:22.583
So you don't hear voices?
- No, sir.

440
00:42:22.683 --> 00:42:27.783
I pray to God and may like to think
that He hears me, but it's not a conversation.

441
00:42:28.783 --> 00:42:32.517
Not like we're pretending now.
- Pretending, soldier?

442
00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:37.036
I know you want to give me an S5,
so I have to go out of service...

443
00:42:37.136 --> 00:42:41.936
but I'm not disturbed above.
I just believe what I believe.

444
00:42:42.077 --> 00:42:46.121
I'm just trying to understand.

445
00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:50.321
Did God tell you
not to pick up a gun?

446
00:42:50.454 --> 00:42:55.081
God says don't kill.
That is one of His most important commandments.

447
00:42:55.265 --> 00:42:59.083
Most people translate that as
'you are not allowed to kill'.

448
00:42:59.183 --> 00:43:02.183
In a war you have very different circumstances.

449
00:43:02.358 --> 00:43:06.377
Jesus said, "A new commandment I give to you....

450
00:43:07.177 --> 00:43:10.077
"That you love one another,
as I have loved you."

451
00:43:10.227 --> 00:43:15.670
We are fighting Satan himself.
Surely, as a good Christian, you will recognize that.

452
00:43:15.836 --> 00:43:18.944
I see that too, and that's why I joined.

453
00:43:21.544 --> 00:43:24.322
But I'm sorry, I won't carry weapons.

454
00:43:24.506 --> 00:43:30.690
His beliefs are unique,
but do not warrant dismissal because of S5.

455
00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.833
How am I supposed to maintain discipline
with someone like him in my unit?

456
00:43:34.025 --> 00:43:37.686
I don't know about that, but he's
an able-bodied Certified Conscientious Objector...

457
00:43:37.786 --> 00:43:43.586
and he should be able to serve as a medic,
provided he completes the entire training.

458
00:43:44.111 --> 00:43:47.895
Perhaps we can turn him from his faith.

459
00:43:48.695 --> 00:43:51.192
Yes, confine it to the barracks and kitchen service.

460
00:43:51.292 --> 00:43:55.506
When he starts talking about God, you bring hell into it.
I want him gone.

461
00:44:12.352 --> 00:44:16.277
Doss, your place is a disgrace.
It's a pigsty.

462
00:44:17.095 --> 00:44:20.288
Are you having a laugh, Ryker? Care to share?

463
00:44:20.454 --> 00:44:21.763
No, sergeant.

464
00:44:22.771 --> 00:44:28.826
What you fail to see is that a unit is
is no better than its weakest member.

465
00:44:29.726 --> 00:44:34.259
To help you understand that,
there are no passes this weekend.

466
00:44:34.359 --> 00:44:40.305
You're all getting corvee. Now all of you
get ready for a 30 kilometer hike.

467
00:44:40.405 --> 00:44:43.060
Shoot.

468
00:44:46.611 --> 00:44:51.189
Keep your head up. Don't go feeling sorry for yourself.

469
00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:54.189
It makes me sick to see
you guys start feeling sorry for yourselves.

470
00:44:54.289 --> 00:44:56.789
Your dogs don't know what being tired is.

471
00:44:56.889 --> 00:44:58.989
We go on and on until I fall over.

472
00:45:07.633 --> 00:45:11.459
Stop doing that. I'm trying to sleep.

473
00:45:14.718 --> 00:45:17.194
Stay away from me.

474
00:45:24.113 --> 00:45:26.046
Why are you still here?

475
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:38.567
Give eight.
- Restore.

476
00:45:46.269 --> 00:45:47.652
Where is Doss?

477
00:46:10.625 --> 00:46:14.826
This is not good for anyone.
- Certainly not what I signed up for.

478
00:46:16.985 --> 00:46:22.353
It's not about that.
It's about the lives of all the men here.

479
00:46:23.654 --> 00:46:25.439
And to yours.

480
00:46:26.139 --> 00:46:27.855
Time to quit.

481
00:46:29.155 --> 00:46:31.339
Get dressed, and I'll walk with you.

482
00:46:38.383 --> 00:46:39.949
It doesn't matter, Doss.

483
00:46:41.649 --> 00:46:43.276
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

484
00:46:58.872 --> 00:47:00.247
Come along.

485
00:47:01.039 --> 00:47:06.308
I have extra duty today,
and I've got chores later, so...

486
00:47:09.008 --> 00:47:10.308
i can't.

487
00:47:16.335 --> 00:47:17.918
Well then, Doss.

488
00:47:20.218 --> 00:47:24.428
Private Doss, can you point out the men
who beat you?

489
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:32.864
No, sergeant.

490
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:36.098
Don't you know who attacked you?

491
00:47:36.216 --> 00:47:38.749
I never said
that I was attacked, sergeant.

492
00:47:39.775 --> 00:47:41.909
So what do you say?

493
00:47:42.609 --> 00:47:45.076
That half your body
became sore while sleeping?

494
00:47:46.984 --> 00:47:49.535
I sleep very poorly.

495
00:47:54.529 --> 00:47:58.279
If you plan to get a wet head,
do put on a hat.

496
00:47:58.388 --> 00:48:00.755
I don't want anyone to piss off cream.

497
00:48:00.905 --> 00:48:03.106
Wouldn't you like that for your coffee, Sergeant?

498
00:48:03.489 --> 00:48:05.806
Now make a dash for it, Smitty.

499
00:48:05.907 --> 00:48:10.058
Do you speak from experience, sergeant?
- Ask your mother about that.

500
00:48:10.158 --> 00:48:11.358
Give eight.

501
00:48:15.801 --> 00:48:17.384
Place rest.

502
00:48:21.594 --> 00:48:25.813
Private Doss, I'm afraid
I can't give you a pass.

503
00:48:25.913 --> 00:48:29.113
This leave is for men
who have passed basic training.

504
00:48:31.956 --> 00:48:34.702
With all due respect, I did pass.

505
00:48:36.002 --> 00:48:40.424
I applied for this leave three weeks ago.
I am getting married this afternoon.

506
00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:44.009
It says here that you are not a shooting enthusiast.

507
00:48:44.584 --> 00:48:47.768
I don't have to carry a gun. Colonel Stelzer...

508
00:48:47.935 --> 00:48:50.771
Colonel Stelzer's determination was:

509
00:48:50.871 --> 00:48:53.571
"Doss may serve as a medic....

510
00:48:53.671 --> 00:48:58.071
"Provided he completes the entire training."

511
00:48:58.254 --> 00:49:01.255
And you didn't pass the shooting range.

512
00:49:02.055 --> 00:49:03.555
Pretty clear.

513
00:49:06.373 --> 00:49:09.085
Show that you can handle a gun....

514
00:49:09.185 --> 00:49:11.385
then I'll sign your leave.

515
00:49:11.485 --> 00:49:16.058
Corporal Cannon, give your weapon to Private Doss.

516
00:49:24.903 --> 00:49:29.155
I'm not touching a gun.
- It's not a request, soldier.

517
00:49:29.255 --> 00:49:32.655
That is a direct order
from the company commander.

518
00:49:32.847 --> 00:49:34.508
For heaven's sake, Doss.

519
00:49:36.008 --> 00:49:38.439
Stop this nonsense and cut it out.

520
00:49:39.365 --> 00:49:44.392
If you refuse, I have no choice
but to drag you before a court martial.

521
00:49:44.492 --> 00:49:48.392
Then you will spend the rest of the war
in a military prison.

522
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.093
I can't.

523
00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:07.239
How long do you want to wait, Dorothy?

524
00:50:08.473 --> 00:50:10.632
We've already waited long enough.

525
00:50:11.833 --> 00:50:16.575
I'm very sorry.
Sometimes men don't dare to take it anymore.

526
00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:22.676
Some men might not.
My Desmond is.

527
00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:57.648
You probably think I'm an asshole....

528
00:50:58.348 --> 00:51:00.921
who cares only about rules and not about his men.

529
00:51:04.422 --> 00:51:05.605
May I?

530
00:51:12.282 --> 00:51:17.926
I believe in this book like everyone else,
and like everyone else, I struggle with my conscience.

531
00:51:18.026 --> 00:51:21.426
But what do you do, when everything you
values is under attack?

532
00:51:22.827 --> 00:51:24.355
I don't know about that, Captain.

533
00:51:25.855 --> 00:51:28.355
I don't have the answer to such questions.

534
00:51:29.355 --> 00:51:34.555
But my values are also under attack,
and I don't know why.

535
00:51:34.888 --> 00:51:38.139
I don't care about your principles,
because the Japs don't either.

536
00:51:38.747 --> 00:51:42.315
If one of them attacked you and a wounded soldier
would attack, what would you do?

537
00:51:42.915 --> 00:51:47.399
Hit him with your Bible?
- I would give my life for my men.

538
00:51:47.499 --> 00:51:50.243
You don't win wars by giving your life.

539
00:51:51.143 --> 00:51:55.543
I'm here because I don't want
you to rot in a jail cell.

540
00:51:56.019 --> 00:52:00.628
Confess guilt. Maybe they'll send you
home to pray.

541
00:52:03.488 --> 00:52:06.163
Let those brave men out there
win this war.

542
00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:17.524
If I can't convince you,
maybe she can.

543
00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.542
I wasn't allowed to call you.

544
00:52:23.443 --> 00:52:25.528
I knew it wasn't your fault.

545
00:52:28.828 --> 00:52:30.628
What did they do to you?

546
00:52:33.212 --> 00:52:37.172
It's nothing. I have
fought with the wall and lost.

547
00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:42.624
They say you might
go to jail. Leavenworth.

548
00:52:43.424 --> 00:52:47.317
There must be another way.
- I wouldn't know what.

549
00:52:47.417 --> 00:52:52.117
I have done almost everything they wanted, and now
I'm being treated like this because I don't want to kill.

550
00:52:52.242 --> 00:52:55.777
You've tried.
No one can say you haven't.

551
00:52:56.477 --> 00:52:58.977
But who are you going to rescue from prison?

552
00:53:00.911 --> 00:53:04.771
Probably no one.
- So why can't you just pick up a gun?

553
00:53:04.871 --> 00:53:07.571
You don't have to use it.
Meet them halfway.

554
00:53:09.338 --> 00:53:11.705
I can't.
- Yes, you can. It's just pride.

555
00:53:11.805 --> 00:53:14.848
Pride and self-conceit.
Do not confuse your will with the Lord's.

556
00:53:27.986 --> 00:53:29.499
Was it pride?

557
00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:33.412
Maybe it's pride.

558
00:53:37.813 --> 00:53:42.174
But how can I live with myself,
if I don't stay true to what I believe?

559
00:53:43.074 --> 00:53:45.424
How could you live with me?

560
00:53:47.324 --> 00:53:50.524
I would never be the man I want to be for you.

561
00:53:57.443 --> 00:54:02.365
I fell in love with you,
because you weren't like the others.

562
00:54:03.865 --> 00:54:05.865
And you didn't want to be.

563
00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:12.965
Never think that you could disappoint me.

564
00:54:15.465 --> 00:54:19.465
I love you, no matter what.

565
00:54:31.644 --> 00:54:35.962
I don't know what he will do.
He will lose either way.

566
00:54:36.495 --> 00:54:40.038
They want him to admit guilt,
but then he is dishonorably discharged.

567
00:54:40.538 --> 00:54:43.522
And if he goes into battle ,
he will certainly go to jail.

568
00:54:44.106 --> 00:54:47.557
They'll call him a coward either way,
and he can't live with that.

569
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.808
Thank you, Dorothy.

570
00:54:52.008 --> 00:54:56.668
If you speak to him again, tell him
that we love him and pray for him.

571
00:54:56.768 --> 00:55:01.702
We are praying for you both.
- I will. Bye.

572
00:55:12.233 --> 00:55:16.133
Just go away.
- Are you out of your mind?

573
00:55:16.233 --> 00:55:20.533
Of course I'm crazy. Then what were you thinking?

574
00:55:20.633 --> 00:55:24.133
Get out of the room.
- Don't, Tom. Put it down.

575
00:55:24.233 --> 00:55:26.337
Stay away from me, woman.

576
00:55:43.925 --> 00:55:45.351
I do, sir.

577
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.203
Can I help you?

578
00:55:58.303 --> 00:56:01.139
I would like to
Brigadier General Musgrove to speak.

579
00:56:01.298 --> 00:56:04.168
Not without an appointment. It's not possible.

580
00:56:10.577 --> 00:56:16.350
Could you tell him
that Corporal Thomas Doss would like to have a word with him.

581
00:56:16.485 --> 00:56:19.053
He has a very important consultation.

582
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:23.927
I fought with him in France near Belleau.
He was my captain.

583
00:56:26.227 --> 00:56:29.727
Please. It is essential.

584
00:56:33.132 --> 00:56:34.609
Thank you.

585
00:56:39.166 --> 00:56:43.003
Standing inside is a man. Tom Doss.
- Doss?

586
00:56:47.485 --> 00:56:52.291
It will be over in a moment. You'll soon be home safe and sound,
as if nothing had happened.

587
00:56:57.298 --> 00:56:59.041
I love you.

588
00:57:45.604 --> 00:57:47.897
This hearing addresses the case of Desmond Doss.

589
00:57:47.997 --> 00:57:51.797
The charge is failure to follow
of orders from his commander.

590
00:57:51.897 --> 00:57:53.697
What does the accused have to say to this?

591
00:57:54.907 --> 00:57:58.554
Private Doss pleads "not guilty.

592
00:57:59.789 --> 00:58:04.244
Is that so, soldier? I thought there was an agreement
and a plea agreement.

593
00:58:06.089 --> 00:58:11.137
Yes, but I changed my mind.
- Just like that? You want to be court-martialed?

594
00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:13.573
Yes, sir.

595
00:58:13.767 --> 00:58:18.054
The consequences are for your own account. Continue.

596
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:22.373
Your Honor...

597
00:58:22.473 --> 00:58:27.444
Private Doss waves his morale at us,
as if it were a medal of honor.

598
00:58:27.544 --> 00:58:32.528
He flaunts his contempt, by not following direct
not following orders from his commander.

599
00:58:32.628 --> 00:58:36.178
While our best guys are sacrificing their lives....

600
00:58:39.259 --> 00:58:40.985
Is it going?
- Yes.

601
00:58:41.754 --> 00:58:44.332
Are they still deliberating?
- Yes, sir.

602
00:58:44.432 --> 00:58:49.071
Take this inside.
- I'm not allowed to. Military personnel only.

603
00:58:49.214 --> 00:58:53.168
Get one of them to bring it.
- They won't help us. They want to bury him.

604
00:58:53.302 --> 00:58:57.712
There is only one question that a court martial
has to ask the accused:

605
00:58:57.812 --> 00:59:01.012
Do you deny disobeying
of Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

606
00:59:04.292 --> 00:59:06.411
Do you deny that, soldier?

607
00:59:11.869 --> 00:59:14.687
No, I'm not denying that.
- Then why are you fighting it?

608
00:59:14.787 --> 00:59:20.087
Why would you, if you don't touch a weapon anyway,
serve in a combat unit?

609
00:59:20.922 --> 00:59:24.750
When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor,
I took it personally.

610
00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:29.967
Everyone I knew wanted to enlist. So did I.

611
00:59:32.755 --> 00:59:34.839
There were two men in my town....

612
00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:40.339
They were rejected and committed suicide,
because they could not enlist.

613
00:59:44.679 --> 00:59:48.692
I worked in a defense plant
and could get a reprieve, but that's not right.

614
00:59:51.392 --> 00:59:54.992
It is not right that other men
should fight and die....

615
00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:59.992
And that I would be safe at home. I must serve.

616
01:00:01.492 --> 01:00:04.592
I have the energy and passion
To serve as a medic.

617
01:00:06.392 --> 01:00:09.792
Along with all those other guys.
Same danger, but...

618
01:00:10.992 --> 01:00:14.292
While they take lives, I will save lives.

619
01:00:17.582 --> 01:00:20.006
Now that the world wants to tear itself apart....

620
01:00:20.106 --> 01:00:24.306
I don't think it's wrong
to want to fix some of that.

621
01:00:27.871 --> 01:00:31.441
I'm sorry, but no one should...
- You don't understand. My son is the accused.

622
01:00:31.626 --> 01:00:35.545
I understand, but no one should....
- I have information...

623
01:00:35.689 --> 01:00:40.937
Very commendable, but the facts
of the indictment are undeniable.

624
01:00:41.889 --> 01:00:44.357
What's going on there?

625
01:00:44.934 --> 01:00:46.319
Let him go.

626
01:00:57.343 --> 01:01:00.400
That's a Great War uniform.
- That's right, general.

627
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:05.882
I have to show you this.
- With all due respect, you are no longer a soldier.

628
01:01:05.982 --> 01:01:08.782
You are not allowed to be here. I'm sorry.

629
01:01:08.925 --> 01:01:11.126
Is that really the way it goes?

630
01:01:12.026 --> 01:01:16.926
You fight for your country, lose so much that means a lot to you, and then you get brushed off?
means to you, and then you're brushed off?

631
01:01:17.086 --> 01:01:21.524
Your uniform is forgotten, you have no voice.
- Were you in Lys?

632
01:01:21.708 --> 01:01:26.264
Yep, and in Belleau.
- Double distinguished, I see.

633
01:01:27.425 --> 01:01:31.864
I take it you are the father of that soldier?
- That's right, General. Thomas Doss.

634
01:01:32.014 --> 01:01:34.960
Then you know, as a former soldier,
that laws apply here...

635
01:01:35.085 --> 01:01:40.899
I know the law, and it protects my son.
It is enshrined in our constitution.

636
01:01:40.999 --> 01:01:45.599
And I believe in that, as does he.
I fought to protect that.

637
01:01:46.599 --> 01:01:49.799
At least I thought so,
because if that wasn't the point...

638
01:01:49.899 --> 01:01:53.099
Then I have no idea what I was doing there.

639
01:01:54.694 --> 01:01:56.968
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

640
01:01:59.068 --> 01:02:00.868
Hand over the letter.

641
01:02:08.354 --> 01:02:09.821
You must go.

642
01:02:25.235 --> 01:02:29.795
"Rights as a Recognized Conscientious Objector
are protected by a statute....

643
01:02:29.895 --> 01:02:33.095
"and he cannot be forced
to renounce it.

644
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:38.100
"That includes, in this case, disobeying
of orders to bear arms."

645
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.800
Signed by Brigadier General Musgrove,
Commander of the War Department, Washington.

646
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:44.242
Colonel?

647
01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:52.444
I withdraw the charges.
- Then this case is declared inadmissible.

648
01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:56.044
Soldier Doss, you may be headed
To the hellfire of battle....

649
01:02:56.144 --> 01:02:58.744
without any weapon to protect yourself.

650
01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:04.244
You can resume your service
and begin training for medic.

651
01:03:10.478 --> 01:03:12.548
Where is he?
- He left immediately.

652
01:03:12.648 --> 01:03:15.856
I begged him to stay, that you wanted to see him.
- I understand.

653
01:03:16.856 --> 01:03:19.031
When you get home, tell him I love him.

654
01:04:00.395 --> 01:04:02.864
Make sure you come back to me.

655
01:04:07.513 --> 01:04:12.987
OKINAWA, MAY 1945

656
01:04:15.206 --> 01:04:19.668
Uncle Sam is good-natured, as peaceful as a child
But don't aggravate him, because then....

657
01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:24.793
Shut up, Hollywood. Shut the fuck up!
- Just be quiet. Shut the fuck up!

658
01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:29.858
I swear I'll shoot you, Hollywood.
- Shut up! Shut up! Save the crowing for later.

659
01:04:30.026 --> 01:04:31.502
It was entertaining for a while.

660
01:04:34.449 --> 01:04:38.420
Make way.
- Get out of the way! Out of the way.

661
01:05:25.558 --> 01:05:28.774
The 96th. Or what's left of it.

662
01:05:29.274 --> 01:05:31.474
We need to replace these guys.

663
01:06:02.683 --> 01:06:05.210
Looks good.
- Safe.

664
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:07.673
Safe, Sarge.

665
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.981
Captain Glover.

666
01:06:28.681 --> 01:06:32.481
Lieutenant Manville of the 96th.
We were told to report to you, Captain.

667
01:06:34.573 --> 01:06:36.387
Give these men something to eat.

668
01:06:36.553 --> 01:06:39.140
This is Sergeant Howell.
- Good to meet you.

669
01:06:39.324 --> 01:06:42.911
Who is Doss?
- There.

670
01:06:45.857 --> 01:06:47.131
Are you Doss?

671
01:06:49.331 --> 01:06:50.831
Irv Schecter.

672
01:06:56.131 --> 01:07:02.131
You and me and Page
are the only medics in this area....

673
01:07:02.331 --> 01:07:04.631
so I think we're going to work together.

674
01:07:05.133 --> 01:07:08.625
Did you come from the line?
- How was that?

675
01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:12.425
I asked how it was.

676
01:07:15.705 --> 01:07:17.018
Hacksaw?

677
01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:22.806
We climbed it six times,
and been thrown off six times.

678
01:07:25.828 --> 01:07:29.114
The last time
there was nothing left of the 96th.

679
01:07:31.811 --> 01:07:33.333
They are animals.

680
01:07:34.933 --> 01:07:37.033
Smelly beasts.

681
01:07:37.218 --> 01:07:39.383
The Japs don't care about death.

682
01:07:40.683 --> 01:07:43.467
They want to die, they keep coming.

683
01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:46.232
And they will never give up.

684
01:07:47.332 --> 01:07:48.432
Never.

685
01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:51.002
Here, take it.

686
01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:58.138
The Japs fire aimed at the wounded.

687
01:07:58.638 --> 01:08:00.733
Remove all Red Cross signs.

688
01:08:01.633 --> 01:08:04.338
The Japs get a bonus
if they shoot down medics.

689
01:08:04.838 --> 01:08:06.838
That white is the bullseye.

690
01:08:07.838 --> 01:08:09.600
I have a new helmet for you.

691
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.938
This size fits everyone.

692
01:08:20.683 --> 01:08:23.693
That's our final goal: Hacksaw Ridge.

693
01:08:23.793 --> 01:08:26.993
If we catch it,
maybe we can catch Okinawa.

694
01:08:27.493 --> 01:08:30.393
If we take Okinawa, we take Japan.

695
01:08:30.693 --> 01:08:34.293
Rest up. Our friends from the Navy
are going to soften them up first.

696
01:09:01.196 --> 01:09:03.339
No one can survive that.

697
01:09:04.751 --> 01:09:06.410
Oh, but she did.

698
01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:29.241
Lieutenant, these bunkers here, here and here,
is that right?

699
01:09:30.741 --> 01:09:32.941
There are three of them. They are...

700
01:09:41.691 --> 01:09:44.659
Yes, maybe a little further back,
but it's all...

701
01:09:46.459 --> 01:09:48.659
it's all different, up there.

702
01:09:48.826 --> 01:09:50.469
All clear, Captain.

703
01:09:51.872 --> 01:09:54.975
Gentlemen, walk it.

704
01:10:20.994 --> 01:10:23.681
That's blood.
- No kidding.

705
01:10:25.667 --> 01:10:28.041
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

706
01:10:30.041 --> 01:10:31.441
Keep climbing.

707
01:10:41.641 --> 01:10:43.941
Here. Come on.

708
01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:14.254
Brown, give this to Jessop.
- Corporal.

709
01:13:22.203 --> 01:13:24.864
Where are they? I don't see anything.

710
01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:28.802
I don't know.
- Where...

711
01:13:32.392 --> 01:13:36.021
Hospice, help. We are here.

712
01:13:38.516 --> 01:13:42.527
Put your hand on this, Jack. Come on.

713
01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:47.127
We're going to get you covered. Come with us.

714
01:14:03.408 --> 01:14:06.862
Forward. Running.

715
01:14:14.773 --> 01:14:17.043
I don't see anything.
- Is that one?

716
01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:18.745
I don't know. Just shoot.

717
01:14:24.804 --> 01:14:26.230
Okay, come on.

718
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:32.330
Vito. Come here.

719
01:14:45.423 --> 01:14:47.608
Corpsman. Vito's been hit.
- I'm on my way.

720
01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:04.481
Get out of the way.

721
01:15:35.899 --> 01:15:37.082
Are you injured?

722
01:15:37.717 --> 01:15:38.935
I have nothing.

723
01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.633
Come on. I got you, Ralph. Keep breathing.

724
01:16:02.733 --> 01:16:07.633
Keep breathing, Ralph. You'll be fine.

725
01:16:08.533 --> 01:16:10.433
Just keep breathing, Ralph.

726
01:16:12.433 --> 01:16:14.533
I got you, I got you.

727
01:16:18.233 --> 01:16:20.209
Give him some morphine, then move on.

728
01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:24.866
He won't last a day.
- Please, Doss, no, no.

729
01:16:24.966 --> 01:16:29.950
Please don't leave me. I have children.

730
01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:33.750
Please. Don't leave me behind.

731
01:16:33.892 --> 01:16:38.847
I'm not going anywhere. I'll make sure you get home.
I got you, Ralph.

732
01:16:38.947 --> 01:16:40.384
I'll make sure you get home.

733
01:16:41.762 --> 01:16:43.947
Here comes the morphine.

734
01:16:44.047 --> 01:16:47.018
It works very quickly. We'll get you out of here.

735
01:16:47.745 --> 01:16:51.974
Portable, portable.

736
01:16:56.589 --> 01:16:58.726
Stand up. Keep walking.
- Can't, I'm hurt.

737
01:16:58.826 --> 01:17:00.411
You don't have anything at all.

738
01:17:02.811 --> 01:17:04.311
Hang in there, kid.

739
01:17:06.645 --> 01:17:09.142
Walking. If you don't move,
you're a target.

740
01:17:12.052 --> 01:17:13.737
This one has priority.

741
01:17:19.745 --> 01:17:22.800
Priority? Ever heard of triage?
He's dead before he's down.

742
01:17:22.942 --> 01:17:24.249
You don't know that.

743
01:17:25.649 --> 01:17:27.849
Bring it down.

744
01:17:30.849 --> 01:17:32.649
Go. Go.

745
01:17:33.121 --> 01:17:35.683
It's going to be okay, buddy. We'll get you home.

746
01:17:40.131 --> 01:17:43.384
Hospice. Help.

747
01:17:43.645 --> 01:17:47.256
If we can't see them,
they can't see us either.

748
01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.320
I got you, Frank. Where'd you get hit?

749
01:18:13.943 --> 01:18:18.598
I think they can see us, wise guy.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go. Give us a hand.

750
01:18:22.037 --> 01:18:26.259
Stay low, lieutenant.
- There. The bunkers.

751
01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:31.032
I see them. You better stay low, Lieutenant.

752
01:18:33.912 --> 01:18:37.057
I see them, straight ahead.
- Yes, I see them, too.

753
01:18:37.182 --> 01:18:39.644
Jerk up as far as you can. Give it all you've got.

754
01:18:39.836 --> 01:18:42.172
I send the weapons team to the flanks.

755
01:18:48.607 --> 01:18:53.829
Keep that tight and you'll be back to your old self in no time.
- I got it, Doss.

756
01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:56.900
Come on. Sit down here.

757
01:18:57.885 --> 01:19:00.621
Is it still going?
- Yeah.

758
01:19:32.297 --> 01:19:33.657
Damn.

759
01:19:34.957 --> 01:19:39.657
You, take that over. You, feed him. Come on, come on, come on.

760
01:19:39.757 --> 01:19:41.257
Fire.

761
01:19:42.857 --> 01:19:44.157
Smoke.

762
01:19:47.557 --> 01:19:49.157
Provide coverage.

763
01:19:55.479 --> 01:20:00.117
Run, Ghoul. Into that hole, and stay there.

764
01:20:03.281 --> 01:20:07.093
Run, Smitty, we'll cover you. Hare over.

765
01:20:13.169 --> 01:20:14.270
Provide coverage.

766
01:20:21.221 --> 01:20:22.681
Ransel.

767
01:20:26.061 --> 01:20:27.854
Ghoul.
- Free.

768
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:36.182
Come on, throw it now, Ghoul.

769
01:20:38.286 --> 01:20:40.163
Provide coverage.

770
01:20:52.287 --> 01:20:54.198
Damn.

771
01:21:04.754 --> 01:21:06.239
Give it coverage.

772
01:21:08.434 --> 01:21:11.254
Corpsman. Help me.

773
01:21:39.054 --> 01:21:40.254
Forward.

774
01:22:28.984 --> 01:22:32.755
I'm right here. Put your hand on it.

775
01:23:19.393 --> 01:23:21.608
Ghoul.

776
01:23:24.508 --> 01:23:25.608
Where did you get hit?

777
01:23:28.908 --> 01:23:31.008
You have a bump on your head,
but that's okay.

778
01:23:31.901 --> 01:23:34.463
What's your name?
- Ernie.

779
01:23:34.655 --> 01:23:37.792
Ernie what?
- Ernie Walker.

780
01:23:37.926 --> 01:23:41.113
Also known as?
- Ghoul.

781
01:23:41.238 --> 01:23:44.075
Ghoul, you're fine.

782
01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:51.474
Very good, men. Good job.

783
01:23:51.574 --> 01:23:55.574
Dig in. We'll hold this position
and sweep the rest tomorrow.

784
01:23:57.009 --> 01:24:01.641
Guys, find a safe place in or near the bunker.

785
01:24:01.741 --> 01:24:05.041
Changing watches every two hours.
We don't know what's out there.

786
01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:08.341
Head low, ass even lower.
Shoot at anything that doesn't speak English.

787
01:24:08.467 --> 01:24:11.449
Does the same apply to Grease?
- Especially for him.

788
01:24:11.549 --> 01:24:15.868
I don't care if you have to piss or shit,
it's not safe to go alone.

789
01:24:17.562 --> 01:24:19.372
Where are you going, Doss?

790
01:24:20.441 --> 01:24:24.387
There are still wounded there, Sergeant.
- I'll go with him.

791
01:24:24.488 --> 01:24:26.750
Be smart. Keep your ears down.

792
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:30.612
Just pick a spot.

793
01:24:37.563 --> 01:24:44.014
Rinnelli and Henry dead within fifteen minutes.
Right at the beginning.

794
01:24:45.683 --> 01:24:50.272
Peterson, Popeye, Standford and Murphy.

795
01:24:50.815 --> 01:24:52.382
Page and Unger.

796
01:24:54.503 --> 01:24:55.754
Ralston.

797
01:24:56.614 --> 01:25:03.089
"In peacetime the sons bury their fathers,
in war the fathers bury their sons."

798
01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.835
Stop with the nonsense.

799
01:25:09.435 --> 01:25:11.008
That doesn't help anyone.

800
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:17.158
You're right about that. Not here.

801
01:25:21.369 --> 01:25:22.640
Enter here.

802
01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:32.189
We have an abdominal wound.

803
01:25:32.789 --> 01:25:35.333
This guy needs plasma.
- He'll be fine. Just leave him here.

804
01:25:35.475 --> 01:25:38.494
You'll be fine. They've got you.

805
01:25:47.031 --> 01:25:50.986
How about we find a hole and dig in?
- Sounds good.

806
01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:53.385
Put on your helmet.

807
01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.807
Aren't you going to eat that?

808
01:26:07.613 --> 01:26:10.074
I don't eat meat. Live it up.

809
01:26:11.409 --> 01:26:13.043
Of course you don't eat that.

810
01:26:22.046 --> 01:26:23.695
That's a beautiful lady.

811
01:26:26.195 --> 01:26:28.695
You do know that she's out of your league, right?

812
01:26:35.937 --> 01:26:37.417
I know that.

813
01:26:39.317 --> 01:26:43.045
Don't tell her that.
- She would be much happier with someone like me.

814
01:26:43.195 --> 01:26:45.047
Until she gets to know you.

815
01:26:46.725 --> 01:26:50.646
I can be an asshole sometimes.
- Sometimes?

816
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.167
Okay then.

817
01:27:21.973 --> 01:27:23.646
Those Japs are sneaks.

818
01:27:25.146 --> 01:27:28.346
I'll take the first watch,
and you can get some sleep.

819
01:28:13.691 --> 01:28:15.008
Not a best dream.

820
01:28:32.921 --> 01:28:37.283
I dreamed that I was impaled.
I couldn't do anything.

821
01:28:38.728 --> 01:28:40.336
There's a gun there.

822
01:28:45.036 --> 01:28:46.736
It really doesn't bite.

823
01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:48.931
Really.

824
01:28:51.131 --> 01:28:54.265
Just look around you.
- After what we just went through...

825
01:28:55.065 --> 01:28:59.267
any sensible person would beg for a gun.
- I never said I was sensible.

826
01:29:05.066 --> 01:29:06.949
My dad is an alcoholic.

827
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:13.558
He fought it in vain for years.
It made him mean.

828
01:29:13.726 --> 01:29:17.813
At least you know him. Mine could be
of many, and they're all worth nothing.

829
01:29:19.875 --> 01:29:22.216
Did your mom raise you?
- I knew her...

830
01:29:22.316 --> 01:29:26.116
but she gave me to an orphanage when I was five.
Never saw her again.

831
01:29:28.216 --> 01:29:30.016
I have learned to hate quickly.

832
01:29:31.416 --> 01:29:34.716
And to judge people even faster,
and I was wrong about you.

833
01:29:44.361 --> 01:29:49.134
My father beat me and my brother, because the sun
rose, and rigged us, because the sun set.

834
01:29:51.934 --> 01:29:53.434
I could handle that...

835
01:29:55.634 --> 01:29:57.834
but if he did that to our mom....

836
01:29:57.994 --> 01:29:59.912
Get out of my way, woman.

837
01:30:07.571 --> 01:30:10.733
That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?

838
01:30:10.916 --> 01:30:15.727
Pull that trigger.
- Stop it. Stop.

839
01:30:22.471 --> 01:30:24.080
But you didn't kill him?

840
01:30:26.351 --> 01:30:28.285
In my heart it does.

841
01:30:49.795 --> 01:30:53.914
That's why I promised God
That I would never touch a weapon again.

842
01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:01.240
You won't get mine, because you're crazy.

843
01:32:05.222 --> 01:32:08.584
Hurry up, get over here.

844
01:32:28.157 --> 01:32:31.859
Retreat, retreat.

845
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.854
They are underground.

846
01:32:49.097 --> 01:32:54.044
Searchlight, here Baker Six. Request Support.
Target is Yoke Tare 5-1-5.

847
01:32:55.021 --> 01:32:58.974
Yeah, I know that's here, but I don't think
that we'll be here for long.

848
01:33:00.268 --> 01:33:04.631
I requested an artillery attack.
- Fall back! Hurry up!

849
01:33:40.761 --> 01:33:43.161
Hey, buddy. I'm here.

850
01:33:52.461 --> 01:33:53.704
Give me cover.

851
01:33:57.004 --> 01:33:58.304
Walking.

852
01:34:10.399 --> 01:34:12.050
Go away.

853
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:16.396
Come here.

854
01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:22.987
You know what to do. Keep pressing it.

855
01:34:26.418 --> 01:34:30.473
No, no plasma. Give it to him, there.

856
01:34:30.573 --> 01:34:33.173
I'll be fine. Go.

857
01:34:33.291 --> 01:34:36.044
Grease, bring Irv back.
- I'm on it.

858
01:34:36.211 --> 01:34:37.395
See you later.

859
01:34:42.745 --> 01:34:44.745
Come on.

860
01:34:48.368 --> 01:34:51.253
We have to get out of here. Come on.

861
01:35:24.334 --> 01:35:25.520
Teach.

862
01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:34.920
We have to get out of here.
- Run.

863
01:36:18.578 --> 01:36:22.249
I'm scared.
- This helps with the pain.

864
01:36:24.735 --> 01:36:27.625
No, don't you dare.

865
01:36:28.125 --> 01:36:31.225
Come on, Smitty, stay with me. We've got to go.

866
01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.549
Help me get him down.

867
01:36:56.749 --> 01:37:00.375
Come on, move!
- You can't help him. He's dead.

868
01:37:01.135 --> 01:37:03.133
Come on, let's go. We have to get out of here.

869
01:37:15.827 --> 01:37:19.740
Come on. All of them, over the edge.

870
01:37:57.449 --> 01:37:59.330
What do You want from me?

871
01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:09.396
I don't understand.

872
01:38:15.529 --> 01:38:17.406
I can't hear You.

873
01:38:18.558 --> 01:38:20.945
Corpsman. Help me.

874
01:38:26.545 --> 01:38:28.745
Help me, Lord.

875
01:38:29.778 --> 01:38:31.271
Well then.

876
01:38:48.199 --> 01:38:51.733
You are in good hands now.
- Take it easy.

877
01:38:52.621 --> 01:38:56.892
Six, eight, fourteen.

878
01:38:57.177 --> 01:38:59.686
Take these men to safety immediately.

879
01:38:59.796 --> 01:39:03.850
Private Ford, how many?
- Only 32 came off.

880
01:39:04.693 --> 01:39:06.686
My goodness.
- Drive on.

881
01:39:08.005 --> 01:39:09.741
Load them up.

882
01:39:49.202 --> 01:39:51.469
It's me, Desmond.

883
01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:55.418
We're going to get you fixed up.
You just need to keep breathing, okay?

884
01:39:56.444 --> 01:39:59.144
The colonel wants to see you.
- I need your jeep.

885
01:39:59.244 --> 01:40:02.142
You two keep watch here. Keep your eyes open.

886
01:40:02.284 --> 01:40:04.485
Stay here. Keep watch.

887
01:40:13.547 --> 01:40:15.457
Help me.

888
01:40:16.568 --> 01:40:17.761
Watch out.

889
01:40:19.061 --> 01:40:20.194
Gotcha.

890
01:40:24.204 --> 01:40:29.407
Put your hand on it, keep pressing.
I'll be back, okay?

891
01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:47.807
Here it comes.

892
01:40:52.607 --> 01:40:56.607
Okay, guys, on three. One, two, three, lift.

893
01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:03.971
You'll be fine, buddy. Keep your head up.

894
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:10.044
We're at the edge, Eric. Hang in there.

895
01:41:30.168 --> 01:41:33.112
It's going to be okay, Eric. You'll be fine, buddy.

896
01:41:37.751 --> 01:41:39.636
Darn it, this is going to work.

897
01:41:40.236 --> 01:41:44.836
One for each leg. You'll be dressed in no time,
and then you can go downstairs.

898
01:41:45.336 --> 01:41:46.436
Gotcha.

899
01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:53.636
I've got you. You have to trust me, Eric.

900
01:42:22.044 --> 01:42:25.370
Japs.
- Wait a minute, that's one of ours.

901
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:26.770
Come along.

902
01:42:28.426 --> 01:42:31.376
I got you, I got you.

903
01:42:31.876 --> 01:42:35.876
Come on, I got you. It's going to be okay.

904
01:42:39.939 --> 01:42:42.984
Hank, another one.

905
01:42:47.807 --> 01:42:53.571
Colonel, call off the artillery attack on Hacksaw.
There are still over 100 men up there.

906
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.974
Tell them to blow off the artillery on Hacksaw.

907
01:42:58.002 --> 01:43:00.479
Sit down, Jack. I'll get you something to drink.

908
01:43:11.934 --> 01:43:13.750
We have lost our coverage.

909
01:43:16.150 --> 01:43:18.650
They are starting to move. We have to leave, come with us.

910
01:43:24.432 --> 01:43:25.604
It was about time.

911
01:43:26.904 --> 01:43:30.804
They keep coming. Lift it up.

912
01:44:07.565 --> 01:44:10.848
Doss.

913
01:44:11.848 --> 01:44:15.548
Help. Help me.

914
01:44:26.519 --> 01:44:29.807
You have to trust me. Take a deep breath.

915
01:45:29.516 --> 01:45:32.411
Come along, buddy. Come on.

916
01:45:34.383 --> 01:45:37.222
Jack, you don't know
if your men are still alive up there.

917
01:45:37.322 --> 01:45:40.222
You can't go back without reinforcements.
Then the rest will go too.

918
01:45:40.364 --> 01:45:44.956
Then give me reinforcements.
- I have no fresh men, no troops.

919
01:45:45.556 --> 01:45:49.856
Three battalions finished today. It takes
more than a day to get men here.

920
01:45:50.482 --> 01:45:52.141
I need them much faster.

921
01:47:43.932 --> 01:47:50.394
It's all right, it's all right. It's all right.

922
01:48:07.686 --> 01:48:09.824
Morphine. That's good.

923
01:48:47.274 --> 01:48:50.429
Pinnick, Pinnick. It's me, Doss.

924
01:48:50.529 --> 01:48:53.829
It's me, be quiet. I've got you.

925
01:48:53.945 --> 01:48:57.132
Are you hit?
- Yes, I can't see anything.

926
01:48:57.266 --> 01:48:59.268
Just be quiet.

927
01:49:01.068 --> 01:49:02.568
Do not move.

928
01:49:03.368 --> 01:49:05.768
I've got you. Hang in there.

929
01:49:06.768 --> 01:49:09.568
So, try now.

930
01:49:12.187 --> 01:49:13.713
I thought I was blind.

931
01:49:15.913 --> 01:49:18.710
Gently. Can you walk?
- I don't know.

932
01:49:18.861 --> 01:49:21.613
We have to get out of here. Come on.

933
01:49:34.835 --> 01:49:39.245
Very good. We got you.

934
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:55.608
Ted, it's me, Desmond.

935
01:49:56.308 --> 01:49:57.865
I'm going to fix you up.

936
01:49:59.065 --> 01:50:01.700
Are you ready to get out of here?
- Definitely.

937
01:50:17.307 --> 01:50:23.754
Please, Lord, help me to get another one.

938
01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:54.150
Please, help me to get another one.

939
01:51:13.026 --> 01:51:16.178
Another one. Help me get another one.

940
01:51:28.274 --> 01:51:32.678
Another one. Help me get another one.

941
01:51:35.806 --> 01:51:37.198
Another one.

942
01:51:38.592 --> 01:51:39.810
On the side.

943
01:51:42.804 --> 01:51:45.690
Where do all these men come from?
- Hacksaw.

944
01:51:45.806 --> 01:51:48.562
I thought they were gone from there.
- Not all of them.

945
01:51:48.662 --> 01:51:51.035
Some lunatic sends wounded down.

946
01:51:51.735 --> 01:51:53.667
Even a few Japs.

947
01:51:54.467 --> 01:51:57.567
Those didn't make it. I'll be right back.

948
01:51:58.302 --> 01:52:01.930
Quietly. Ready, drive.

949
01:52:33.335 --> 01:52:35.420
Come here. There are Japs everywhere.

950
01:52:37.739 --> 01:52:42.534
Damn it. Private Corn Stalk.
You're full of surprises.

951
01:52:43.595 --> 01:52:47.063
Do you want morphine?
- Yes, that or a bullet.

952
01:52:48.641 --> 01:52:50.892
Please.

953
01:52:54.392 --> 01:52:58.492
Let's see. How about this?

954
01:52:59.092 --> 01:53:00.592
Not bad.

955
01:53:02.492 --> 01:53:03.592
Let's see.

956
01:53:04.392 --> 01:53:07.492
Looks worse than it is.
The girls will still want to kiss you.

957
01:53:09.352 --> 01:53:12.647
Sergeant, will you make it here for a while?

958
01:53:12.747 --> 01:53:16.426
Yes, go ahead.
- I'll be back.

959
01:53:16.526 --> 01:53:19.169
Ready? You and me, come with me.

960
01:53:53.994 --> 01:53:56.779
Captain, there is something you need to see.

961
01:53:59.015 --> 01:54:01.379
Our men were sent down all night
sent downstairs.

962
01:54:01.479 --> 01:54:05.579
And Hollywood is here. I thought I would
I'd never see him again. Come on, he's here.

963
01:54:09.333 --> 01:54:12.986
What the hell?
- How's it going, Captain?

964
01:54:13.154 --> 01:54:15.756
Hey, Cap.
- Captain.

965
01:54:18.116 --> 01:54:21.052
Good to see you, kid.
- Captain Glover.

966
01:54:21.227 --> 01:54:25.498
How did you get down?
- Doss. Howell is also still there.

967
01:54:25.666 --> 01:54:30.194
Did Howell and Doss do this?
- Actually, only Doss.

968
01:54:30.336 --> 01:54:32.096
Just Doss?

969
01:54:32.255 --> 01:54:34.824
Yes, Doss, the coward.

970
01:55:50.645 --> 01:55:53.113
You're like chewing gum under a shoe.
- Enter here.

971
01:55:53.882 --> 01:55:56.817
Little late for target practice, don't you think?

972
01:56:00.655 --> 01:56:02.464
Jump on it.
- You don't mean that.

973
01:56:02.657 --> 01:56:04.290
I'm going to drag you.

974
01:56:09.538 --> 01:56:10.789
Onward then.

975
01:56:13.458 --> 01:56:15.935
Ready? Here we go.

976
01:56:20.632 --> 01:56:22.075
We have company.

977
01:56:23.359 --> 01:56:24.492
Come on.

978
01:56:45.055 --> 01:56:46.238
Arms up.

979
01:56:47.073 --> 01:56:50.644
You don't mean that, Corn Stalk.
- "You're tying a bowline, not a bra."

980
01:56:56.415 --> 01:56:58.659
Ready? Go ahead.

981
01:57:25.584 --> 01:57:27.210
Put me down.
- Yes, sergeant.

982
01:57:27.878 --> 01:57:30.271
Sergeant Howell.
- Doss is still up there.

983
01:57:32.156 --> 01:57:34.701
What's that?
- There are Japs after him.

984
01:58:06.689 --> 01:58:07.849
We got it.

985
01:58:18.134 --> 01:58:22.080
It's okay, Doss. You're safe.

986
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:25.580
Come on, Doss. Come on.

987
01:58:39.762 --> 01:58:43.223
Desmond, it's all right.

988
01:58:47.419 --> 01:58:51.014
Quietly. Sit down, come on.

989
01:58:56.253 --> 01:58:57.603
Are you injured?

990
01:59:02.216 --> 01:59:04.243
No.

991
01:59:06.762 --> 01:59:09.432
Take this soldier to a sick tent immediately.

992
01:59:09.532 --> 01:59:12.860
Come on, quietly. Make room.

993
02:00:01.246 --> 02:00:04.848
Where's Irv?
- You mean Schecter, the medic?

994
02:00:05.448 --> 02:00:09.348
He didn't make it.
Died of shock. No plasma.

995
02:00:10.348 --> 02:00:11.448
I'm sorry.

996
02:00:47.107 --> 02:00:50.777
I only saw a skinny little man.
I didn't know who you were.

997
02:00:55.222 --> 02:00:58.979
You have done more for your country,
than anyone else could have done.

998
02:00:59.579 --> 02:01:02.479
And I've never misjudged anyone so much.

999
02:01:03.872 --> 02:01:06.149
I hope one day you can forgive me.

1000
02:01:18.611 --> 02:01:20.760
We have to go up again tomorrow.

1001
02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:26.460
I know that tomorrow is your Sabbath.

1002
02:01:32.316 --> 02:01:35.086
Most people don't believe like you.

1003
02:01:36.786 --> 02:01:41.186
But they believe very much, in how much you believe.

1004
02:01:43.986 --> 02:01:48.586
What you did up there is a miracle,
and they want to be a part of it.

1005
02:01:51.786 --> 02:01:53.986
They won't go up without you.

1006
02:02:05.250 --> 02:02:08.857
What are you waiting for, Captain?
The attack should have started ten minutes ago.

1007
02:02:08.974 --> 02:02:11.770
We're waiting, Colonel.
- For what?

1008
02:02:14.050 --> 02:02:17.021
Until Private Doss finished praying for us.

1009
02:02:17.130 --> 02:02:21.054
Private Doss is praying for you? Who is Private Doss?

1010
02:02:42.662 --> 02:02:44.180
Getting Started.

1011
02:04:36.676 --> 02:04:40.676
Lying down. On the ground.

1012
02:05:21.976 --> 02:05:24.573
Wait, wait. I got the morphine.

1013
02:05:25.868 --> 02:05:28.762
Hurry up! Get these men out of here.

1014
02:05:33.382 --> 02:05:37.473
My Bible, my Bible.

1015
02:05:37.581 --> 02:05:40.185
Stop, stop.

1016
02:05:40.295 --> 02:05:44.035
My Bible, my Bible.

1017
02:07:00.829 --> 02:07:04.518
You're going home, Desmond.
We have conquered Hacksaw.

1018
02:07:08.961 --> 02:07:11.178
Wait a minute. Desmond.

1019
02:08:28.561 --> 02:08:33.721
DESMOND DOSS HAS CARRIED 75 WOUNDED MEN
TAKEN TO SAFETY ON HACKSAW RIDGE

1020
02:08:34.948 --> 02:08:40.835
HE WAS THE FIRST RECOGNIZED CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR
TO RECEIVE THE MEDAL OF HONOR

1021
02:08:40.935 --> 02:08:45.451
AMERICA'S HIGHEST AWARD
FOR BRAVERY UNDER FIRE

1022
02:08:48.614 --> 02:08:55.017
DESMOND AND DOROTHY WERE MARRIED
UNTIL HER DEATH IN 1991

1023
02:08:57.030 --> 02:09:01.401
HE REMAINED MODEST ABOUT HIS HEROIC DEEDS
ALL PRAISE WENT TO GOD

1024
02:09:01.488 --> 02:09:03.971
I was praying the whole time.

1025
02:09:04.671 --> 02:09:09.171
I kept praying:
Lord, please help me to get another one.

1026
02:09:09.871 --> 02:09:14.471
When I got that, I said:
Lord, please help me to get another one.

1027
02:09:14.622 --> 02:09:21.011
HE SAID, "THE REAL HEROES ARE BURIED THERE"

1028
02:09:21.134 --> 02:09:25.061
It is wrong to bring someone's beliefs
be compromised.

1029
02:09:25.162 --> 02:09:28.662
It doesn't matter if that's the military,
or whatever.

1030
02:09:28.762 --> 02:09:33.062
If you are convinced of something ,
it's not a joke.

1031
02:09:34.562 --> 02:09:35.662
That's what you are.

1032
02:09:37.848 --> 02:09:41.625
Even though I said those things to him,
about carrying a gun...

1033
02:09:41.825 --> 02:09:47.725
And that he would never fight by my side,
if he didn't have a gun.

1034
02:09:48.225 --> 02:09:51.625
Only to find out in the end....

1035
02:09:51.725 --> 02:09:55.525
that he was one of the bravest people
in the world...

1036
02:09:55.925 --> 02:10:01.425
and that he then saved my life was very ironic.

1037
02:10:01.961 --> 02:10:06.224
Blood was running down his face and eyes.

1038
02:10:07.324 --> 02:10:10.924
He lay there groaning and calling for a medic.

1039
02:10:12.624 --> 02:10:18.924
I took water from my bottle and some bandages,
and washed his face.

1040
02:10:20.124 --> 02:10:24.624
And when that blood was gone from his eyes ,
he looked at me brightly.

1041
02:10:24.724 --> 02:10:27.924
He was totally alive.

1042
02:10:29.324 --> 02:10:32.324
He said, "I thought I was blind."

1043
02:10:33.424 --> 02:10:38.424
And just that smile on his face....

1044
02:10:38.524 --> 02:10:41.324
has been more than worth it.

1045
02:10:42.787 --> 02:10:49.042
DESMOND DOSS DIED AT THE AGE OF 87
IN MARCH 2006
