1
00:01:01.747 --> 00:01:02.247
Oh god.

2
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:05.871
Nina.

3
00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:08.995
What's wrong?

4
00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:11.019
Look, turn this light on quickly.

5
00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.643
She's doing well.

6
00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.667
This is totally a huge 
one at a time.

7
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.091
So it should be on it.

8
00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:25.115
I think that's scary.

9
00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:28.239
What are you doing there?

10
00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:30.263
I can't sleep.

11
00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:31.787
I'm afraid that she will secure 
me or

12
00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:34.411
she gives me one of her two 
comforts and lays eggs there.

13
00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:38.935
Do you want me to 
sleep down there?

14
00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.559
Get into my bed.

15
00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.583
No, I am safe here.

16
00:01:42.607 --> 00:01:44.607
When she's hungry, she 
starts with you.

17
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.331
Thank you, nice.

18
00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:49.855
Sleep well.
-You too.

19
00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.579
I forgot you completely.

20
00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:17.203
Help, i can't move.

21
00:02:18.127 --> 00:02:20.127
What since you lay 
down there all night.

22
00:02:21.551 --> 00:02:23.551
Hello, my back.

23
00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:28.775
There's no such thing as that.

24
00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.499
There comes flowers.

25
00:02:32.523 --> 00:02:34.523
Hold on, carefully.

26
00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:37.047
Otherwise you will cut your 
fingers off yourself.

27
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:39.071
Yes or she picks up your shoes.

28
00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:41.295
My shoes.

29
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.319
Morning.

30
00:02:50.443 --> 00:02:52.443
Did you sleep well?

31
00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.467
Goes so.
-Why?

32
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:58.491
Couldn't you sleep because 
of Mr. kiss?

33
00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:01.515
No, i had a really strange dream.

34
00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.139
From Kaya? I don't want to 
hear that at all really.

35
00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:06.163
No, not from Kaya.

36
00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.987
From Max.

37
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.011
Tells me every detail?

38
00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:16.535
No, leave it.
That was really a crazy dream.

39
00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.559
Please Lu.

40
00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:23.183
All right then.

41
00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:25.207
Max and i were in a meadow and
he has photos made

42
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:27.231
and then I put my leg.

43
00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:29.255
Exciting?

44
00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.279
That's not all,

45
00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:33.303
then he said a lot of things to me.

46
00:03:33.827 --> 00:03:36.227
That he likes me and and then

47
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:42.351
and then he kissed me.

48
00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:48.375
Are you happy that you 
like going to school?

49
00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.199
Also too.

50
00:03:50.223 --> 00:03:52.223
And because the plant 
grows so quickly.

51
00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:54.247
Yes, way too fast.

52
00:03:54.771 --> 00:03:56.771
I need my make-up.

53
00:03:57.095 --> 00:03:58.895
But that's fine

54
00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.319
the faster we can solve the 
puzzles and keep going.

55
00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:04.543
If you don't let us have 
breakfast beforehand plastered.

56
00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:07.367
Please plant out.

57
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:16.691
And then Daniel and I see 
each other again more often.

58
00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:19.415
He was always here.

59
00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.539
Yes but only so briefly.

60
00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.963
When you are on to
then that's not good either.

61
00:04:25.987 --> 00:04:27.987
It gets boring really quickly.

62
00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:30.011
Not with us.
-Yes,

63
00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.135
also with you.

64
00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.259
It's better if you don't see 
each other that often.

65
00:04:33.283 --> 00:04:35.283
That makes the whole thing a lot
more exciting.

66
00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:37.607
But I was being with him 
the whole time.

67
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:40.131
Now listen to me,

68
00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:43.655
besides, you should today on 
the first day look sensational.

69
00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.879
Then he doesn't find himself 
so quickly boring.

70
00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:49.303
Thank you.

71
00:04:51.227 --> 00:04:53.227
I know it doesn't make 
any sense.

72
00:04:54.051 --> 00:04:56.051
And you are not allowed 
to tell anyone.

73
00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:57.775
But

74
00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:59.799
I don't even want to talk about it.

75
00:05:00.223 --> 00:05:02.723
Dreams are totally stupid.
Which is not true anyway

76
00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:05.447
If I would want to kiss Max.

77
00:05:08.571 --> 00:05:10.571
And what about Kaya now?

78
00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:13.095
I don't know.

79
00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:15.119
His performance was pretty stupid.

80
00:05:16.543 --> 00:05:18.543
But maybe was just excited.

81
00:05:19.567 --> 00:05:21.567
I found he looked quite relaxed.

82
00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:23.591
Yes, you are right too.

83
00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:27.015
I don't know myself, Lotte.

84
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.039
I've kissed seven boys or six.

85
00:05:29.063 --> 00:05:31.063
Maybe it wasn't after all Kaya,

86
00:05:31.587 --> 00:05:33.987
you know what, try again 
with the appointment.

87
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:36.411
Be persistent.

88
00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:39.035
Yes, the last time is not 
at all responded to it.

89
00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:42.359
Stay tuned.
Asks him

90
00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:44.983
then he shows his real thing 
face, believe me.

91
00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:54.807
Madness.
The flowers have risen.

92
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.531
What did i tell you this morning?

93
00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:03.055
That's great.

94
00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.479
Already be careful, yes Felix.

95
00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:10.803
Oh my God.

96
00:06:13.927 --> 00:06:17.027
Stop your stupid joke, Felix.

97
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:20.851
Plant the seeds, the soil 
from a grave.

98
00:06:21.675 --> 00:06:23.675
They want

99
00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:26.299
What? what do they want?

100
00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:29.723
Living meat.

101
00:06:30.447 --> 00:06:32.447
Away from the plant.

102
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.071
My uncle.

103
00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:38.695
If the seeds are planted from 
them at the grave will then

104
00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.319
Then what?
-They want live meat.

105
00:06:42.043 --> 00:06:44.043
And you tell us that
only now?

106
00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:46.767
I don't stay in one a second 
longer room with this,

107
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.291
this one eat meat stripped.

108
00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:52.015
It eats everyone up.

109
00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.539
Now come down again.
That will not happen.

110
00:06:54.563 --> 00:06:58.063
It grew so big in one night,
right Nina?

111
00:06:58.087 --> 00:06:59.687
Yes.

112
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.711
I'm leaving now.
Now eats us all up.

113
00:07:02.535 --> 00:07:04.535
I want to be at 
breakfast now.

114
00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:15.059
My bread.

115
00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:33.483
Good morning.

116
00:07:34.407 --> 00:07:36.507
Nina, nice that you're back.

117
00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:40.031
How are you?
-Better.

118
00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:42.055
And want to take lessons again?
-Yes.

119
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:44.079
I've missed a lot.

120
00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:46.503
That's not exactly a little subject.

121
00:07:46.527 --> 00:07:48.327
I will help her.
-Yes?

122
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:50.951
Well, I know that you are in 
good hands with you but is

123
00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:52.675
That's really no problem.

124
00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:54.599
I'll make show what she missed,

125
00:07:54.623 --> 00:07:56.623
right Nina?

126
00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.747
Nina.

127
00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:12.771
Nina, Is everything fine?
-Yes.

128
00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:18.895
Nina.

129
00:08:20.919 --> 00:08:22.919
I...

130
00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:32.143
What was going on next to it?

131
00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:34.167
I don't know.

132
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:37.691
I had, I thought

133
00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:40.615
Did you remember anything?

134
00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:42.639
Yes.

135
00:08:43.263 --> 00:08:45.263
I don't want that anymore.

136
00:08:53.287 --> 00:08:55.287
And?
-I don't have.

137
00:08:55.311 --> 00:08:57.111
I kept my word.

138
00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:58.835
Myself too.

139
00:08:58.859 --> 00:09:00.259
I almost have it.

140
00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:02.283
I hope you know how 
important the grail is.

141
00:09:02.307 --> 00:09:04.607
Yes, of course.
-Essential.

142
00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:08.731
Go and let me know when 
you have find it.

143
00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:17.355
It's just me.

144
00:09:17.579 --> 00:09:19.579
Must also with something.

145
00:09:20.303 --> 00:09:22.303
What's that?

146
00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:24.927
This is nothing.

147
00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:26.951
I just leaned against the 
blackboard.

148
00:09:28.175 --> 00:09:29.675
Still doing something today?

149
00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:31.699
Yes, I wanted to ask you that too.

150
00:09:31.723 --> 00:09:33.723
There's market this afternoon.

151
00:09:34.747 --> 00:09:37.747
Market?
-Yes, with tennis things and such.

152
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:40.271
Today afternoon, I can't.

153
00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:44.095
Really not or don't you feel like it?

154
00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:45.919
No, that's not it.

155
00:09:45.943 --> 00:09:47.943
I really can't.

156
00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:49.767
What do you have to 
do to yourself?

157
00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:51.791
Actually I have to

158
00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:53.515
homework.

159
00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:55.039
I'm missing something in 
history and

160
00:09:55.063 --> 00:09:57.663
I have to really do something.
-Is everything okay with you?

161
00:09:57.687 --> 00:09:59.687
See you later, okay?

162
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:06.911
So, wait a minute

163
00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:08.935
tonight, good, alright.

164
00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:10.959
I have to get you.

165
00:10:13.483 --> 00:10:15.483
We can go jogging.

166
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.307
Good idea, because we'll 
write that for tomorrow.

167
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:19.731
Yes.

168
00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:21.755
The one, that's the last one.

169
00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:24.579
Certainly.

170
00:10:24.603 --> 00:10:26.603
Very sure.
-Really?

171
00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:29.927
I only kissed six and not seven like
I counted myself?

172
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.351
You have guaranteed 
the seventh one.

173
00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:38.575
If you think.

174
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.599
Yes, sure.
-Sure?

175
00:10:44.123 --> 00:10:46.123
We do that tomorrow.

176
00:10:46.147 --> 00:10:48.147
All right.
-See you tomorrow.

177
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:52.071
Kaya.

178
00:10:54.995 --> 00:10:56.995
I thought maybe,

179
00:10:57.019 --> 00:10:59.019
you want something company?

180
00:10:59.643 --> 00:11:01.643
We? a date?

181
00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:06.667
Yes, i have noon today.

182
00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:09.291
That works great, i also have time.

183
00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:11.315
Really?

184
00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:13.739
Well, Lotte.
