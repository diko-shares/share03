You just wouldn't make it
out of your mouth.

That's the difference

I can't do this anymore.

This is for me.
This isn't for you.

[SLOW MUSIC PLAYING]

182

[CODY] I don't understand why
everybody has to be so judgmental.

183
00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:15.004
I understand
why Mom's judgmental.

184
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:17.631
I think it's 'cause
she cares partially.

185
00:07:18.007 --> 00:07:20.968
I think it's also partially 'cause
everyone else is looking at her like,

Well, first things first, Sal,

Dig this, Sal.
Section behind me.

It's called "The Boneyards."

231
00:09:09.535 --> 00:09:12.371
Very few surfers have ventured
in there and come out alive.

232
00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:14.791
[SAL] Are you trying to tell
me people have died here?

That's right, Sal.
