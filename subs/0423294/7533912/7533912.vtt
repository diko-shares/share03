1
00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:04.335
And I've been surfing
ever since I can remember.

2
00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.585
It's hard to imagine my life
when I wasn't surfing.

3
00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:12.185
I want to get out of here,
and this is my ticket out.

4
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.535
I'm really good, man.
I'm the best on the island.

5
00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:21.785
I know it sounds cocky for saying that,
but, I mean, I am, like the best.

6
00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:31.585
I was born and raised here in Shiverpool.

7
00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:35.325
Lived here my whole life.

8
00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:39.525
That's where they sort the fish. It's
the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

9
00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:44.574
But yeah, I worked there
just to pacify my mom a little bit.

10
00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:47.464
Good old Shiverpool.

11
00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.244
This place sucks, bro.

12
00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:54.974
I worked my way up from the sardine
pile, then to the mackerel pile...

13
00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.984
...and I ended up
on the gefilte fish pile.

14
00:00:57.154 --> 00:00:59.454
- All hard work.
- Not like some I could mention.

15
00:00:59.624 --> 00:01:01.814
Yes, this farkakte kid
with the thing on the water.

16
00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:03.384
My house?

17
00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:05.724
Over there. You see it
right there with the surfboards?

18
00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:09.934
Yeah, I just live here with me
and my brother, Glen, my mom.

19
00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:13.264
He was a little, teeny, small egg.

20
00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:16.174
He wasn't very impressive.

21
00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:18.334
Glen was the big egg,
Cody was the small egg.

22
00:01:19.074 --> 00:01:21.504
He can't help it.
That's just the way he is.

23
00:01:21.674 --> 00:01:22.774
I mean, he's out there...

24
00:01:24.114 --> 00:01:27.574
...in the water all day
shirking his responsibilities.

25
00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:31.404
You know, hatching these eggs
is a big responsibility.

26
00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.884
And my brother, Cody,
he just doesn't understand that.

27
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:38.684
- He needs to step up and be a man.
- It takes a real man to sit on an egg.

28
00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:41.834
- You know it.
- Quincy, come to Daddy.

29
00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:44.275
He wants to be different.
All the time with the different.

30
00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:45.734
Who's got the time in the day to...

31
00:01:45.864 --> 00:01:47.354
Only six months in a day.

32
00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:49.494
- Thanks for making it.
- Sorry. It was too good to miss.

33
00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:51.974
- Thanks for making it.
- How was it out there?

34
00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:53.904
He's the big brother.
I'm the little brother.

35
00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:55.864
I'm not touching you.

36
00:01:56.044 --> 00:01:57.644
- Not gonna touch you.
- Do you see this?

37
00:01:57.714 --> 00:01:58.974
- Don't. Please?
- I'm not.

38
00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:00.514
He makes sure that I know that.

39
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:04.444
I had to fight for everything.
Even Mom's tuna casserole.

40
00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:12.753
I'm lucky I survived.

41
00:02:12.923 --> 00:02:15.953
It really wasn't that easy
for him growing up.

42
00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:18.193
Like I said before...

43
00:02:19.263 --> 00:02:21.463
...he never really knew his father.

44
00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:28.533
I'm not really the person to ask about it
because I was too young to remember.

45
00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:31.303
Look, I'm not the only kid on the island...

46
00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:35.003
...whose dad was, you know, eaten.

47
00:02:35.713 --> 00:02:40.983
- Still, it had to be traumatic.
- No. Not for me, bro. Not for me.

48
00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:45.583
- What's your dream?
- To go away.

49
00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:49.763
- To go away. That's great.
- Do you guys want a drink?

50
00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.993
Got to run away
from responsibility and life.

51
00:02:53.163 --> 00:02:54.433
This is unique.

52
00:02:54.603 --> 00:02:56.793
- This is not the norm.
- "I have dreams."

53
00:02:58.173 --> 00:03:01.003
- When is this not happening?
- Don't make that noise.

54
00:03:03.073 --> 00:03:05.173
- Cody!
- It's really disrespectful.

55
00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:07.543
I would never do that.

56
00:03:09.613 --> 00:03:11.343
You just wouldn't make it
out of your mouth.

57
00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:13.183
That's the difference between you and me.

58
00:03:13.383 --> 00:03:15.613
You know what?
I can't do this anymore.

59
00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:17.023
Mom. Look what you did.

60
00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:19.553
This is for me. This isn't for you.
Why is Glen still here?

61
00:03:19.723 --> 00:03:22.253
Oh, yeah, exactly. Mom!

62
00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:24.363
I don't understand why
everybody's so judgmental.

63
00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:26.723
I understand why Mom's judgmental.

64
00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:30.462
I think it's because she cares,
partially. It's also partially because...

65
00:03:30.642 --> 00:03:33.202
...everyone else is looking at her like,
"Hey, Cody's just a bum.

66
00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:35.702
Cody's this. Cody's that.
Cody's this."

67
00:03:36.372 --> 00:03:38.932
Cody's me, bro. Let me be me.

68
00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:41.272
When is that gonna start?

69
00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:56.622
You know what they call me?
The dream maker. The dream maker.

70
00:03:58.032 --> 00:04:00.002
I find these kids, I bring them here...

71
00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:03.402
...and I give them a chance
to be somebody.

72
00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:07.372
You know my greatest joy
as a surf promoter? Finding Z.

73
00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:09.012
Watching him rise to the top.

74
00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:13.412
I still can't believe he's gone.
He was like a son to me, you know?

75
00:04:13.582 --> 00:04:17.342
It was a heart thing, you know?
Can we just take five minutes?

76
00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:20.682
How's my hair? Is it messed up?
I ain't got all day. Is it mussed?

77
00:04:20.852 --> 00:04:22.652
We just have a few more questions
about Big Z.

78
00:04:22.722 --> 00:04:24.522
But right now
I think we're more interested...

79
00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:26.962
...in the Reggie Belafonte story,
and who could blame us?

80
00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:28.852
But Big Z is kind of the focus of our...

81
00:04:29.032 --> 00:04:30.932
Let's get the coconut filler guy over here.

82
00:04:31.102 --> 00:04:32.722
And how about the guy sweeping the sand?

83
00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:36.702
Can we hear your boring story
about your tedious, ridiculous life?

84
00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:38.562
Get your feathers off it! Stop!

85
00:04:38.772 --> 00:04:40.702
I ain't got all day.
I got a big production here.

86
00:04:40.872 --> 00:04:42.032
Roll, okay? Just roll!

87
00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:46.432
Welcome, fans, to another edition
of SPEN Sports.

88
00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:48.242
This is Sal Masakela...

89
00:04:48.412 --> 00:04:52.751
...and we're here at the surfing capital
of the world, Pen Gu Island...

90
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:57.221
...for a preview of the tenth annual
Big Z Memorial Surf-Off.

91
00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:00.281
Professional surfers extraordinaire...

92
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:02.321
...Kelly and Rob tell us...

93
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:04.891
...what challenges
our surfers are going to face.

94
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:08.901
First things first, Sal. The wave.
It's the perfect combination...

95
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:13.461
...of beauty and danger. Even
the pros are terrified of this place.

96
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:16.671
Hi, Mom.

97
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:18.371
Dig this, Sal. Section behind me.

98
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:22.031
It's "The Boneyards."
Few surfers have ventured in there...

99
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:23.201
...and come out alive.

100
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:25.981
Are you trying to tell me
people have died here?

101
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:28.781
- That's right, Sal.
- A moment of silence for them.

102
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:33.011
And we keep it moving because
if the Boneyards was not enough...

103
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:37.091
...our surfers will be facing off with
Tank "The Shredder" Evans.

104
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:40.091
Tank, nine-time defending champ.

105
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:42.201
A role model? No.

106
00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:46.331
But I do consider myself somebody
that everyone should look up to.

107
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:49.101
Kids should try to pretend
that they're Tank.

108
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:51.741
I mean, they should try.
Good luck, kids.

109
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:55.241
You never want to get in there
and help them out...

110
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.141
...and show them how to surf
and spend some time with the kids?

111
00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:00.981
No, I don't want to do that.

112
00:06:01.151 --> 00:06:03.381
- Anyway, this is my wave.
- Always classy Tank Evans.

113
00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:06.281
Coming up after the break,
penguin dodge ball. Stick around.

114
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:11.061
Okay, to get back to the competition,
I just want to say:

115
00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:14.161
I'm scouring the globe
for the next big thing.

116
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:15.860
But that's another story.

117
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.030
He doesn't look for them.
I find them.

118
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.010
I find these penguins.
I find the talent.

119
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.000
Reggie has sent me everywhere on this trip.

120
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.600
Anyplace there's an ocean...

121
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.580
...a lake, a puddle.
It's ridiculous.

122
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.720
I am on so much migraine medication,
you have no idea.

123
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.050
The stress is killing me. I don't know
how much longer I can last.

124
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.220
I have to tell you that right now.

125
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.290
You gotta try this blowhole thing, man.

126
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.730
This whale dude
is giving me a brain freeze.

127
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.870
I lost a bet.

128
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.600
Excuse me. Excuse me.

129
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.230
Does anybody
in this entire frozen wasteland surf?

130
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.040
- The Cody Maverick kid does that.
- Wonderful. Thank you.

131
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.220
You know, you're sitting on...
thin ice.

132
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.510
Excuse me, I'm looking for...
I'm looking for Cody Maverick.

133
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.320
- Has anyone seen Cody Maverick?
- I'm Cody Maverick.

134
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.920
Mike Abromowitz from the Big Z
Memorial Surf-Off, Pen Gu Island.

135
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.050
You came here on a wha...
You came to see me. Wow!

136
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.190
- Quite a slip-and-slider, aren't you?
- You're here. What an honor, sir.

137
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.730
Lovely. Wonderful. I hear you surf.

138
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.660
- Is this true?
- You gotta see what I can do.

139
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.530
- You can actually stand on a board?
- I'll be back.

140
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.900
You're gonna see what I can do
everything's gonna be good...

141
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.400
...and I'm coming with you.
- I can't imagine a better day.

142
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.609
Ma! Ma, he came... the scout.
Mikey. He came. He's here.

143
00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:41.449
- What? Yeah.
- He's giving me a shot now, Ma.

144
00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:43.179
You want to come watch me surf?

145
00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:45.289
- No, that's okay.
- Just this time.

146
00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:50.259
- I'm busy. I'm chopping here.
- Okay. All right, well, wish me luck.

147
00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:53.729
Cody, just be careful of those big waves.

148
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:58.689
Well, anytime now.

149
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:03.169
You should have been here yesterday.
We had a sweet swell yesterday.

150
00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:06.309
I was doing some layback 360s
and floaters. It was insane.

151
00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:07.809
Wow! Start the whale.

152
00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:09.909
No! Wait! Wait!
Just give me one more chance.

153
00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:11.909
- All I need is one, please.
- You just had it.

154
00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:13.849
- Dude, please don't go.
- Tough break, kid.

155
00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:16.379
- Just wait one second.
- Better luck next year. Move it.

156
00:08:16.549 --> 00:08:19.489
- Let's go. He's coming!
- Just one wave. That's all I need.

157
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:23.579
I've never won anything my whole life.

158
00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:27.359
Just once I want to feel like a winner.

159
00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:31.929
I used to scout songbirds. Toucans
for this musical revue in Brazil.

160
00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:34.369
Now that's show business.
Toucans...

161
00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.599
Hold on!

162
00:08:36.609 --> 00:08:39.369
I don't care what you say,
I'm coming to Pen Gu!

163
00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:44.379
No way, no how.
This is a contest for big-wave surfers.

164
00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:47.039
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?
Step on it, fish sticks!

165
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:51.009
No, no, no, no!

166
00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:59.049
Poor kid. I feel bad a little bit.
Honestly, this is embar...

167
00:08:59.229 --> 00:09:00.699
No, wait! Wait!

168
00:09:12.508 --> 00:09:14.338
Did you guys see that?
He almost had my board!

169
00:09:15.308 --> 00:09:18.148
He almost had it.
Next time we'll get it.

170
00:09:18.318 --> 00:09:20.178
- Yeah, so anyway...
- Wait!

171
00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:44.938
We got you. We got you.
Oh, you are heavier than you look.

172
00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:47.168
- Man, we did it.
- Thank you.

173
00:09:47.348 --> 00:09:48.838
Teamwork always pays off.

174
00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:50.738
- I'm Chicken Joe, man.
- Thanks, Joe.

175
00:09:50.918 --> 00:09:54.278
Don't you ever, ever, do anything
like that in the contest, all right?

176
00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:55.708
- I'm in?
- Yeah, you're in.

177
00:09:55.888 --> 00:09:59.788
Because that was entertaining,
in a horrifying sort of way.

178
00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:02.518
Right on, dude.

179
00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:06.528
My name's Cody Maverick,
Shiverpool. You?

180
00:10:06.698 --> 00:10:09.028
No, I'm not from Shiverpool.

181
00:10:09.368 --> 00:10:12.958
- Where are you from?
- Dude, I'm from Lake Michigan.

182
00:10:13.138 --> 00:10:15.128
That's where I surf.
I was the only one...

183
00:10:16.608 --> 00:10:18.468
...around my town who did it.

184
00:10:18.678 --> 00:10:21.038
A lot of people thought
I was crazy, but I'm used to that.

185
00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:23.408
- I know how you feel, Joe.
- You do?

186
00:10:23.648 --> 00:10:26.277
- Yeah.
- Radical.

187
00:10:29.647 --> 00:10:33.047
- Butt freeze!
- Somebody help the chicken.

188
00:11:11.327 --> 00:11:12.917
Look out!

189
00:11:14.227 --> 00:11:16.197
Slater, Machado.
How's it going, bros?

190
00:11:16.367 --> 00:11:17.727
- Good. Thanks.
- What's up, buddy?

191
00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:19.497
Okay. Later, dudes.

192
00:11:20.437 --> 00:11:21.957
Radical.

193
00:11:42.927 --> 00:11:46.517
Dude, look where I'm standing.
I'm standing where Z stood.

194
00:11:48.296 --> 00:11:52.126
- Aw, man.
- Dude, you gotta try this.

195
00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:54.856
- No, I'm okay.
- Come on. Just one bite.

196
00:11:55.036 --> 00:11:57.366
All right. One bite, that's it.

197
00:11:58.736 --> 00:12:00.466
Yeah, yeah? What do you think?

198
00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:02.906
It's not bad.
It kind of tastes like chicken...

199
00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:05.246
Yep. What's chi-chi?

200
00:12:05.576 --> 00:12:08.636
Coming through! Oh, crap.

201
00:12:13.956 --> 00:12:16.426
Oh, man. I'm in love.

202
00:12:16.586 --> 00:12:19.646
Help me! I'm drowning!

203
00:12:22.896 --> 00:12:26.626
What are you standing here
next to me for? Go talk to her, man.

204
00:12:26.796 --> 00:12:28.836
- I'm not gonna talk to her.
- She's digging on you.

205
00:12:29.006 --> 00:12:30.126
- She called you crap.
- Joe.

206
00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.206
- Thanks again.
- All right, well...

207
00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:34.736
...this is the third time
you've been unconscious this week.

208
00:12:34.806 --> 00:12:36.726
I just don't think
it's very good for your brain.

209
00:12:36.806 --> 00:12:39.366
- I know. Bye, Lani.
- Okay.

210
00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:43.036
Yeah, that was awesome
how you saved his life and all.

211
00:12:43.216 --> 00:12:46.846
That was just unbelievable. Really.

212
00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:51.246
You here for the surf contest?

213
00:12:52.026 --> 00:12:56.226
- Well, I'll be watching you.
- Really? You'll be watching me?

214
00:12:56.396 --> 00:12:58.026
Well, yeah, from the lifeguard station.

215
00:12:58.196 --> 00:13:00.496
- Yeah. Right.
- It's my job.

216
00:13:00.666 --> 00:13:02.796
- That's your job.
- Are you gonna kiss her?

217
00:13:02.966 --> 00:13:04.996
- What's going on?
- Come on, Joe.

218
00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:07.596
- You were saying you were in love...
- No, I didn't say that.

219
00:13:07.606 --> 00:13:09.326
- Look, he really digs you.
- Joe, listen...

220
00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:11.635
He likes you, though. See you.

221
00:13:11.815 --> 00:13:13.905
I love my job.
I have an amazing job.

222
00:13:14.075 --> 00:13:15.475
Just this week, with the contest...

223
00:13:17.045 --> 00:13:20.455
...it's a little crazy. You really
have to be extra, extra attentive.

224
00:13:20.715 --> 00:13:23.815
When you have so many guys
in the water you can't miss a thing.

225
00:13:23.985 --> 00:13:27.655
But you know what? I have a perfect
record. I've never lost anybody.

226
00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:29.885
Sure, there have been close calls, but...

227
00:13:30.065 --> 00:13:32.655
- Help!
- Oh, Arnold. I turn my back for one...

228
00:13:32.835 --> 00:13:35.165
- Just lay some feeling on her.
- How do you mean?

229
00:13:35.335 --> 00:13:38.705
- Through words. Through touch.
- Walk me through the approach.

230
00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:41.235
- I'm Lani. You're me.
- You sure about that?

231
00:13:41.405 --> 00:13:44.465
- I get real serious.
- Let's not. Let's not.

232
00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:46.135
- Whoa.
- What is it?

233
00:13:46.675 --> 00:13:49.275
That's it! That's Big Z's shrine.

234
00:13:49.445 --> 00:13:52.845
- Remember?
- No, no. Not really.

235
00:13:54.255 --> 00:13:58.125
Today, the world of surfing
lost one of its legends.

236
00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:00.915
Big Z took his final ride this morning...

237
00:14:01.095 --> 00:14:05.585
...during a competition with
up-and-coming surfer Tank Evans.

238
00:14:06.165 --> 00:14:11.105
Z was last seen paddling into
a massive swell off Pen Gu Bay.

239
00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:24.845
Friends of Big Z gathered
to remember and celebrate his life.

240
00:14:27.215 --> 00:14:28.215
Great shot!

241
00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:29.855
What? Hey!

242
00:14:30.455 --> 00:14:33.284
- Every time.
- He's got a pretty good throwing fin.

243
00:14:33.454 --> 00:14:35.624
Stop doing... Stop it! Cut it out!

244
00:14:36.394 --> 00:14:39.294
- That's like three in a row.
- Here, give it a shot.

245
00:14:41.634 --> 00:14:45.864
What? Wait a minute. Look at this.

246
00:14:46.034 --> 00:14:48.474
- Don't. Stop it.
- It's a Big Z necklace.

247
00:14:48.644 --> 00:14:51.704
That's not funny. Stop.
Stop! What are you doing?

248
00:14:51.874 --> 00:14:54.004
Look, everybody, it's Big Z's last fan!

249
00:14:54.214 --> 00:14:56.074
Coming through.
Out of the way. Let's go.

250
00:14:56.244 --> 00:14:58.404
- You don't deserve to talk about him.
- He's a big zero.

251
00:14:58.414 --> 00:15:00.054
- Shut your mouth!
- Zero starts with "Z"!

252
00:15:00.084 --> 00:15:02.914
You'll never be as good as Big Z, Stank.

253
00:15:04.054 --> 00:15:07.614
Hey, hey, people, come on now.
Smile on your brother.

254
00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:12.124
- Keep your girlfriend out of this!
- You can't do that to my friend.

255
00:15:12.864 --> 00:15:15.804
You're getting quite a workout there.
That feels good.

256
00:15:15.964 --> 00:15:19.464
Why don't you work on my glutes
a little bit? That's very nice.

257
00:15:21.144 --> 00:15:25.164
- All right. That's enough, guys.
- I'll take you on anytime, anywhere.

258
00:15:25.344 --> 00:15:28.904
Well, then how about
right here, right now, huh?

259
00:15:29.084 --> 00:15:31.414
Hey, Mikey, get this kid a board!

260
00:15:31.584 --> 00:15:35.414
All right, who wants to see
the little guy take on the champ?

261
00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:37.244
Little guys rule!

262
00:15:37.424 --> 00:15:44.264
A little one-on-one surfing action
between Tank Evans and Jerry...

263
00:15:44.434 --> 00:15:46.194
- Cody. Cody.
- Cody Maverick.

264
00:15:46.534 --> 00:15:51.194
Cody Mavencourt. And the one
that rides the biggest wave wins.

265
00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:06.213
Are you nervous
about going against Tank Evans?

266
00:16:06.383 --> 00:16:08.813
Ah, Tank. Nervous?
What do I have to be nervous about?

267
00:16:28.273 --> 00:16:29.603
Give it up! Come on, now!

268
00:16:29.773 --> 00:16:31.603
I'm gonna chum the water with your head.

269
00:16:31.773 --> 00:16:35.043
- Bring it on, pecker face. Let's go.
- Pecker face?

270
00:16:39.313 --> 00:16:40.643
It's mine!

271
00:16:50.723 --> 00:16:52.663
So, Cody, when you take your first wave...

272
00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:55.293
...and the whole island's there
to watch, what'll it be like?

273
00:16:55.463 --> 00:16:58.303
It's gonna be amazing.
It'll be the best wave of my life.

274
00:16:58.473 --> 00:17:01.023
I hope the cameras are rolling
because you'll want to watch it...

275
00:17:01.033 --> 00:17:04.563
...over and over and over again.
It's gonna be awesome!

276
00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:21.022
I can't look.

277
00:17:21.522 --> 00:17:25.122
- Poor kid. He's... Poor kid.
- Wow! That was spectacular!

278
00:17:28.332 --> 00:17:30.892
I'm number one! The Tank!

279
00:18:05.332 --> 00:18:08.792
We're trying to get the details.
The lifeguard just pulled him in.

280
00:18:12.312 --> 00:18:15.762
That's what happens
when you take on the Tank, right?

281
00:18:17.582 --> 00:18:18.772
Cody, Cody!

282
00:18:18.952 --> 00:18:21.612
- How is he? Okay? What can I do?
- Yeah, he's okay.

283
00:18:21.782 --> 00:18:26.782
I can help. Except if there's blood.
Just the thought of blood makes me...

284
00:18:27.592 --> 00:18:29.612
Somebody help the chicken.

285
00:18:29.792 --> 00:18:32.282
- Tank, you okay?
- Tank needs fuel.

286
00:18:32.792 --> 00:18:34.992
Mikey, get the board, will you?

287
00:18:35.502 --> 00:18:37.622
Come on. Come on. Come on.

288
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:47.101
- Did I win? I won, huh?
- You should've stayed in Antarctica.

289
00:18:48.111 --> 00:18:50.171
- Oh, wow.
- You're gonna be okay.

290
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:54.541
Look at that.
There's pixies everywhere.

291
00:18:56.021 --> 00:18:59.511
What do you think about Cody going
into a contest and possibly winning?

292
00:18:59.691 --> 00:19:00.711
- You know, I'm...
- Ha.

293
00:19:00.891 --> 00:19:04.651
- Why did you just laugh?
- Because he keeps saying "possible."

294
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:09.261
Like it's "possible" that you're gonna
win. And you're gonna do anything.

295
00:19:09.431 --> 00:19:12.801
- Really, what are the chances?
- They're high. Aren't they high?

296
00:19:13.101 --> 00:19:17.161
I mean, they're normal chances.
It's not like I'm, like, the underdog.

297
00:19:27.781 --> 00:19:32.511
Hey, Geek! Geek!
Get up and help me.

298
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:34.291
Geek.

299
00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:36.611
Geek?

300
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:42.691
Geek. Wake up! I need your help.

301
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:45.491
Come on. Get off your lazy butt
and come and help me.

302
00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:47.331
Beautiful dream.

303
00:19:47.501 --> 00:19:50.801
- Did you ever know Sheila?
- No. I don't know Sheila.

304
00:19:50.971 --> 00:19:52.941
- Wait, wait, wait. What?
- What?

305
00:19:53.111 --> 00:19:54.111
Who's this guy?

306
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:57.001
- He's a surfer. He's hurt.
- Who are all those guys?

307
00:19:57.181 --> 00:19:59.301
They're with him. Ignore them.

308
00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:01.211
- Come on.
- Lani, what are you doing?

309
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:03.541
If you help him, they'll go away.

310
00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:06.240
- Hey! Get out of here!
- Help him!

311
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.750
- Where do you want him?
- Nowhere. That's the whole point.

312
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.950
- No outsiders. Come on.
- I know, I know, I know.

313
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.460
This is an emergency. He went down
bad over the falls. I don't know if he...

314
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.630
- And did he hit the reef?
- I don't know.

315
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.290
I'm not sure. I got him after...

316
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.270
- What, is he your boyfriend?
- No. No.

317
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.000
Wait, wait, wait.
Looks like he stepped on a fire urchin.

318
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.340
Stepped on me? Are you kidding?
This guy was dancing on me.

319
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.480
Just look at this. Broken, broken,
gone, gone, broken, broken, broken...

320
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:44.490
This is pretty bad.
This is really bad.

321
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.360
- What... Cody!
- I hurt.

322
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.930
- You're gonna be okay. What?
- Maybe I shouldn't have taken that out.

323
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.000
Poison's released. Wow. Amazing.

324
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:55.600
- What's amazing?
- That you're still alive.

325
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.970
It's all right. I'm gonna fix you up.
I can fix your foot just fine.

326
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.900
- Where is it? I've been looking...
- It's a saw. You just threw a saw.

327
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.840
Don't let him move like that. He's
pushing the poison all over his body.

328
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.250
- Come on, come on.
- I know he looks...

329
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.350
Here it is.

330
00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.410
- What are you doing?
- What is he doing?

331
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.890
This is a sure-fire cure.

332
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.020
I learned it from an old medicine
man. It, well, works wonders.

333
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.290
- What? No! Not that!
- Not what?

334
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.690
What is he gonna... Gonna what?

335
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:28.799
- Come on, now.
- Geek, stop.

336
00:21:28.969 --> 00:21:32.409
Let's do this. Lani, can you make
some water sounds?

337
00:21:32.569 --> 00:21:34.869
- Oh, my gosh, this is so gross.
- What is water sounds?

338
00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:38.769
- Come on. Here we go.
- No, no, no. You...

339
00:21:42.749 --> 00:21:45.809
Kid, you better keep your mouth shut.
See, what'd I tell you?

340
00:21:45.989 --> 00:21:49.049
Hold his foot still, Lani. Come on.
Knock him out or something.

341
00:21:49.219 --> 00:21:51.379
- I'm running on empty here.
- I'm trying!

342
00:21:56.299 --> 00:21:59.129
So how you been?

343
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:02.639
Wow, sea urchin in the foot.
That sounds pretty nasty.

344
00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:03.799
Yeah.

345
00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:05.669
How do you cure something like that?

346
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:08.239
You pee on it.

347
00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:11.509
- That's disgusting.
- I know!

348
00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:15.079
Hey. How long am I stuck
with this guy?

349
00:22:15.249 --> 00:22:17.109
- Because you know...
- Till he's better.

350
00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:21.879
Well, come back soon and,
please, bring me some clams.

351
00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:23.579
- No.
- I'm running low here.

352
00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:26.479
I can't keep doing this. You've got
to start taking care of yourself.

353
00:22:26.589 --> 00:22:28.249
- Oh, come on.
- Bye.

354
00:22:28.729 --> 00:22:33.219
- Bring me some more clams!
- Okay.

355
00:22:43.109 --> 00:22:45.809
If it's just as well with you,
I don't want to talk about Cody.

356
00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:48.099
He lost. That's it.
That's his problem. It's not mine.

357
00:22:48.249 --> 00:22:50.249
Aren't you concerned
about anybody's well-being...?

358
00:22:50.278 --> 00:22:53.198
The kid's fine. He was born in water.
He's a penguin, for crying out loud!

359
00:22:53.218 --> 00:22:55.978
- Did you see that wave hit him?
- That's the whole idea of surfing.

360
00:22:56.158 --> 00:22:59.278
- I care. I care!
- Mikey! Wait till you see this.

361
00:23:00.228 --> 00:23:02.388
Look at those little legs.
Stick, stick, stick, sticky.

362
00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:04.928
It's the way I walk. I'm constantly...

363
00:23:05.098 --> 00:23:08.068
- Boom-chicka-chicka...
- What's with the "boom-chicka-boom"?

364
00:23:08.698 --> 00:23:12.498
I can't stand blood.
I can't stand the sight of blood.

365
00:23:12.668 --> 00:23:16.508
I can't stand...
sight of blood. Cody!

366
00:23:17.708 --> 00:23:22.238
- Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?
- No.

367
00:23:22.778 --> 00:23:25.618
Cody? Cody?

368
00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:29.378
He's not under there.

369
00:23:29.888 --> 00:23:32.688
Cody!

370
00:23:34.528 --> 00:23:35.858
How's it going, man?

371
00:23:39.398 --> 00:23:40.868
So I woke up this morning.

372
00:23:41.028 --> 00:23:45.438
I didn't know where I was. It's never
a good place to be when you wake up.

373
00:23:45.608 --> 00:23:47.798
Come on. Get up.

374
00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:49.668
- I don't want to.
- Breakfast.

375
00:23:49.838 --> 00:23:53.278
- Wakey, wakey. Come on.
- I don't want to.

376
00:23:54.508 --> 00:23:55.908
- How's your foot?
- My foot...

377
00:23:56.078 --> 00:24:00.178
- My foot's fine, but my head.
- Good. Good. Come on, kid. Get up.

378
00:24:00.918 --> 00:24:02.648
What the...?

379
00:24:04.058 --> 00:24:06.178
Yeah, I think I got a concussion.

380
00:24:09.728 --> 00:24:12.958
You should meet my brother, Glen.
You guys would really hit it off.

381
00:24:13.127 --> 00:24:18.627
Oh, no. No. Where's my necklace?
Did you see my necklace? It's gotta...

382
00:24:19.437 --> 00:24:20.797
No, no.

383
00:24:20.967 --> 00:24:24.097
Big deal. Get yourself another one
at Reggie's trinket shops.

384
00:24:24.307 --> 00:24:27.507
It's not just some necklace, guy.
He gave it to me himself.

385
00:24:27.677 --> 00:24:30.947
- Who?
- Big Z. When he came to Shiverpool.

386
00:24:31.117 --> 00:24:33.547
That guy believed in me
when no one else did.

387
00:24:33.717 --> 00:24:35.687
He told me never to give up
and to find a way...

388
00:24:35.857 --> 00:24:38.317
...because that's what winners do.
- What winners do. Yeah.

389
00:24:38.487 --> 00:24:41.047
It's funny, you know,
what a loser I became.

390
00:24:41.227 --> 00:24:45.527
Who cares what Big Z said?
You got to...

391
00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:51.327
...you know, do things your own way.
- I don't have a way.

392
00:24:53.207 --> 00:24:58.837
You do now. Just follow this.
It'll take you back to North Beach.

393
00:24:59.347 --> 00:25:02.207
Okay, nice to meet you.
Good luck.

394
00:25:11.087 --> 00:25:12.177
What do I do now?

395
00:25:12.357 --> 00:25:15.847
I can't show my face on the beach.
I can't go home.

396
00:25:18.297 --> 00:25:22.287
You always visualize where you're
gonna be, what you're gonna do.

397
00:25:26.007 --> 00:25:27.797
This ain't it.

398
00:25:56.396 --> 00:25:59.336
- What are you doing here?
- Here.

399
00:25:59.506 --> 00:26:03.406
- Oh, man. Thank you, man. This...
- Yeah.

400
00:26:03.576 --> 00:26:05.166
That's cool of you to come back.

401
00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:07.366
- Thank you.
- Better keep that knot tight.

402
00:26:07.546 --> 00:26:09.706
You lose it during a contest, it's a goner.

403
00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:13.476
Yeah, well, I'm not going
in any surf contests.

404
00:26:14.086 --> 00:26:19.576
Well, there's more to surfing
than beating Tank Evans, you know.

405
00:26:20.986 --> 00:26:22.286
Yeah.

406
00:26:22.496 --> 00:26:25.396
Look at that.
You know what you're sitting on there?

407
00:26:26.096 --> 00:26:27.856
That's koa wood.

408
00:26:28.026 --> 00:26:30.156
Best surfboards in the world
are made of that stuff.

409
00:26:30.336 --> 00:26:33.356
- Yeah?
- You got a koa board?

410
00:26:33.536 --> 00:26:39.306
- No, I don't have a "board" board.
- Well, you wanna...?

411
00:26:40.046 --> 00:26:41.566
You want to make one?

412
00:26:42.716 --> 00:26:44.236
- Nah.
- What?

413
00:26:44.416 --> 00:26:46.716
I come all the way back here
to give you the necklace...

414
00:26:46.886 --> 00:26:50.376
...and I'm offering to make you
a board and you say, "Nah."

415
00:26:50.556 --> 00:26:53.286
Get off your lazy butt.
We're making a board. Come on.

416
00:26:53.456 --> 00:26:55.326
- All right.
- It's gonna be the best board...

417
00:26:55.496 --> 00:26:56.516
...you ever had.

418
00:26:56.696 --> 00:26:58.246
- All right?
- Okay, man.

419
00:26:58.426 --> 00:26:59.485
Cody!

420
00:27:02.195 --> 00:27:03.285
That's cool.

421
00:27:03.635 --> 00:27:06.495
Joe, can you just tell us
why you're out here looking for Cody?

422
00:27:06.665 --> 00:27:09.035
You know, we've known
each other way back...

423
00:27:09.205 --> 00:27:14.075
...since, like, yesterday, I think it was.
We got a lot in common.

424
00:27:14.345 --> 00:27:16.405
I never really knew my father either.

425
00:27:22.715 --> 00:27:25.705
Why are you making surfboards
in the middle of the jungle anyway?

426
00:27:25.885 --> 00:27:28.375
I'm just trying to understand.
I don't get it.

427
00:27:28.555 --> 00:27:32.085
Forget the 20 questions.
Let's just get the board made.

428
00:27:32.495 --> 00:27:37.295
Okay, it's just...
Are you a surfer, or do you...?

429
00:27:39.905 --> 00:27:42.925
- Very funny.
- Less talk, more pushing. Come on.

430
00:27:43.535 --> 00:27:45.905
Why are we pushing it?
Why don't we just roll it?

431
00:27:46.745 --> 00:27:47.865
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

432
00:27:48.045 --> 00:27:51.775
I didn't know your foot was there.
Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

433
00:27:51.945 --> 00:27:54.975
It's not like I intentionally did it.
I'm sorry.

434
00:27:57.015 --> 00:27:59.245
- Cody. The log!
- Yeah, I know!

435
00:28:00.885 --> 00:28:03.485
Geek! Stop, stop!

436
00:28:04.955 --> 00:28:08.695
Cody, grab the vine. Grab the vine!

437
00:28:10.335 --> 00:28:12.565
- Now, pull it.
- I'm trying!

438
00:28:12.735 --> 00:28:14.535
Pull!

439
00:28:19.175 --> 00:28:20.535
Cody!

440
00:28:21.814 --> 00:28:23.144
Geek!

441
00:28:23.844 --> 00:28:25.104
Cody!

442
00:28:31.514 --> 00:28:34.424
Oh, no, no, no.

443
00:28:36.894 --> 00:28:39.624
Help me up so I can kick your butt.

444
00:28:40.964 --> 00:28:45.364
- I thought I killed you. You okay?
- Next time, when I say don't roll the...

445
00:28:45.534 --> 00:28:47.664
Wait. What's that?

446
00:28:50.374 --> 00:28:54.334
Yeah, it's a beach.
Sand, water, sun.

447
00:28:54.544 --> 00:28:57.174
You seen one, you seen them all.
Let's get out of here.

448
00:28:57.344 --> 00:28:59.604
No, come on, man.
Let's go check it out.

449
00:29:04.854 --> 00:29:06.914
You think Cody and the Geek
are doing all right?

450
00:29:07.084 --> 00:29:09.814
Yeah. I hate to see him
living out there all alone.

451
00:29:09.994 --> 00:29:11.854
It'll be good for him
to have something to do.

452
00:29:24.534 --> 00:29:27.444
Hey. Somebody's old board shack.

453
00:29:35.084 --> 00:29:36.314
Look at this.

454
00:29:40.184 --> 00:29:42.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

455
00:29:42.994 --> 00:29:45.223
These are Big Z's boards.

456
00:29:45.393 --> 00:29:49.553
Yeah, these are Big Z's boards.
He rode this in the Australian Open.

457
00:29:50.963 --> 00:29:53.933
This is the board he rode
when he came to Shiverpool, man.

458
00:29:54.103 --> 00:29:56.863
This... I... Geek!

459
00:29:57.033 --> 00:29:59.633
This is Big Z's place, man!
This is where he lived!

460
00:29:59.803 --> 00:30:01.503
This is where he made his boards!

461
00:30:01.673 --> 00:30:03.043
Did you know this was here?

462
00:30:03.673 --> 00:30:05.303
Why didn't you wanna come down here?

463
00:30:05.483 --> 00:30:09.573
And then he went up to this
old shack, you know.

464
00:30:23.493 --> 00:30:26.993
And I realized, you know...

465
00:30:28.003 --> 00:30:29.903
...it was Z.

466
00:30:53.163 --> 00:30:56.653
I could tell he needed some space
and some time to himself.

467
00:30:56.963 --> 00:30:58.833
I didn't want to ask him
all these questions.

468
00:30:59.003 --> 00:31:01.763
So I just kind of stood there quietly.

469
00:31:01.933 --> 00:31:04.403
You're Big Z! I can't believe it.

470
00:31:04.573 --> 00:31:06.333
You're alive! You're alive!

471
00:31:06.503 --> 00:31:08.302
That's the respectful way to go, I think.

472
00:31:08.612 --> 00:31:09.902
Why are you alive?
What happened?

473
00:31:10.072 --> 00:31:12.342
Tell me everything.
Start at the beginning and just go.

474
00:31:12.612 --> 00:31:15.272
Kid! You're gonna
hurt yourself. Relax.

475
00:31:15.452 --> 00:31:19.212
And people said you were dead,
but you're not dead. You're in hiding.

476
00:31:19.552 --> 00:31:21.182
Did something happen?
Something happened.

477
00:31:21.352 --> 00:31:23.652
You saw something
you weren't supposed to see.

478
00:31:23.822 --> 00:31:25.062
I knew it!
That's what happened!

479
00:31:25.222 --> 00:31:28.052
Are you nuts?
It's not a conspiracy. It's no big deal.

480
00:31:28.222 --> 00:31:31.852
- What happened?
- I don't want to talk about it.

481
00:31:34.602 --> 00:31:36.092
You don't... Okay, I got it!

482
00:31:36.272 --> 00:31:40.902
I'll be over here if you need anything
or you just feel like talking.

483
00:31:41.302 --> 00:31:43.642
Do you feel it now? Like talking now?

484
00:31:43.812 --> 00:31:46.542
- Go away.
- Got it. All right. I'm going away.

485
00:31:46.712 --> 00:31:47.942
Unless you...

486
00:31:48.142 --> 00:31:49.612
- Cody!
- Okay, got it.

487
00:31:49.782 --> 00:31:53.082
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is, like, it's huge, man.

488
00:31:53.252 --> 00:31:56.622
It changes everything.
The contest is a few days away.

489
00:31:56.792 --> 00:32:01.882
If I can get him to train me, then...
Boom. I could win this with him.

490
00:32:02.362 --> 00:32:05.822
It's my dream. And I don't want to
give up on that dream.

491
00:32:06.002 --> 00:32:08.932
Winners find a way, no matter what, right?

492
00:32:10.872 --> 00:32:12.992
A winner is...

493
00:32:15.372 --> 00:32:17.462
They see their goals.
They just go for it.

494
00:32:17.642 --> 00:32:19.732
They're not in it for the money or glory.

495
00:32:19.912 --> 00:32:23.242
- A winner is... like...
- Hey, hey!

496
00:32:24.052 --> 00:32:26.282
It's the surfer who's out there
having the most fun.

497
00:32:26.452 --> 00:32:27.782
Yep, it's a lot of fun.

498
00:32:28.792 --> 00:32:31.311
Right, I get you. What's winning
without the losers?

499
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:33.961
They're in it for the joy of it
and the rapture...

500
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:36.201
...and the slow-motion
instant replay, which is my...

501
00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:39.131
Head over to the snack bar
and get yourself a big bowl of shut up!

502
00:32:39.301 --> 00:32:42.061
Feels better when there's a lot
of losers around.

503
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:43.721
Was that your question?

504
00:32:43.901 --> 00:32:48.231
A winner is somebody who doesn't
knock me off my surfboard...

505
00:32:48.571 --> 00:32:51.441
...and break it when I'm trying
to get some big waves.

506
00:32:51.611 --> 00:32:54.411
Especially Tank.
He is definitely not a winner.

507
00:32:54.581 --> 00:32:57.411
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.

508
00:32:58.011 --> 00:33:00.571
Yeah, I can't remember a time
when I wasn't surfing.

509
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:03.681
My mom put me right on there.
I think she pooped me out...

510
00:33:03.851 --> 00:33:05.151
...just put me right on there.

511
00:33:05.321 --> 00:33:07.021
What is it about surfing that you love?

512
00:33:07.291 --> 00:33:09.451
I love being the center of attention...

513
00:33:09.631 --> 00:33:12.361
...because it's really
where I should be.

514
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:17.131
And I love the looks
my ladies give me, you know?

515
00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:21.331
The little glint. I love that.
I love holding the ladies.

516
00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:24.531
- You know what I'm talking about?
- I think so.

517
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:27.111
- Sort of.
- Come with me.

518
00:33:30.281 --> 00:33:32.181
Put this curtain in myself.

519
00:33:34.351 --> 00:33:36.151
These are my ladies.

520
00:33:37.521 --> 00:33:39.951
This is Jill.
This is my lady, Amy.

521
00:33:40.121 --> 00:33:42.461
Little Suzie. Briana.

522
00:33:42.631 --> 00:33:45.561
- You know why we call her Briana?
- No.

523
00:33:45.731 --> 00:33:47.161
It's a long story.

524
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:50.131
Shaniqua. Helga. Miss Kitty.

525
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:52.461
Jeannie. I dream of...

526
00:33:52.871 --> 00:33:56.500
Theresa.
This is Theresa right here.

527
00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.510
- Now, is Theresa, is that your...
- Dirty girl.

528
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:06.010
This spot?
This spot is for my special lady, Lia.

529
00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:11.080
I'm gonna say that one more time.
Lia. Oh, yeah.

530
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.310
That's a sweet, sweet lady.

531
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.190
Tank! Are you polishing
your trophies again?

532
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.990
Mom, I wasn't polishing.
I was talking to my friends.

533
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.360
I'm gonna be polishing later.

534
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.030
When's he coming out?
I'm running out of film.

535
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.500
Mr. Topanga! Could you
tell us why you're not dead?

536
00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.970
No! I am dead! I'm dead.

537
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.380
What are you doing?

538
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.790
Hey, who said you...

539
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.620
Turn the board around.
Get back here.

540
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:51.850
Come out here and show me some moves.

541
00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.390
- No, no.
- Come on!

542
00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.230
- Grab a board and come out.
- You want to kill yourself, go ahead.

543
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.700
Fine with me.
Just don't mess up my board.

544
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.640
- How do you turn this thing?
- It's not a short board. Sit back on it.

545
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.300
Hey, watch the wave!

546
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.940
You mess up my board,
I'm messing up your other foot.

547
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:15.350
I'm just trying to ride
this canoe or whatever it is, okay?

548
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.049
Stop trying so hard! Just relax.

549
00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:21.579
What do you mean, rela...?

550
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:26.389
Long, smooth strokes.

551
00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:29.529
- Dig deep. Dig, come on.
- I'm digging!

552
00:35:29.699 --> 00:35:33.229
Keep the nose up! Keep it up!
Watch it! You're pearling!

553
00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:42.769
- What are you doing?
- Come on, please?

554
00:35:42.949 --> 00:35:45.409
Z, I can't learn anything
with you on the beach.

555
00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:48.449
Well, then you're not gonna learn anything.

556
00:35:48.619 --> 00:35:51.779
- Now, come on in.
- I'm not coming in until you come out.

557
00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:55.749
Oh, you're coming in, all right.
He's not even watching the wave.

558
00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:58.219
- What wave?
- That one.

559
00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:02.689
Five, four, three, two, and...

560
00:36:14.979 --> 00:36:17.739
- Don't touch my stuff, man.
- I couldn't help it.

561
00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:22.079
- I just wanted to learn from the best.
- Yeah, well.

562
00:36:22.249 --> 00:36:24.849
- I don't surf anymore, okay?
- What?

563
00:36:25.019 --> 00:36:26.649
What do you mean, you don't surf?

564
00:36:26.819 --> 00:36:29.149
You want to learn
how to surf the right way?

565
00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:30.759
Sure.

566
00:36:30.929 --> 00:36:33.759
Then you gotta make
your own board, all right?

567
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:37.589
- What do you mean, you don't sur...
- Can't hear you.

568
00:36:37.769 --> 00:36:39.758
- Can I ask one question...
- We're making a board.

569
00:36:39.768 --> 00:36:42.258
Could you tell me about your board?

570
00:36:42.438 --> 00:36:46.068
I just have a palm tree board.

571
00:36:46.508 --> 00:36:49.338
I would have to say it's not
the nicest board in the world...

572
00:36:49.508 --> 00:36:51.448
...but it is a pretty good board.

573
00:36:51.608 --> 00:36:54.408
The ancient Hawaiians believe
that "mana" or heart...

574
00:36:54.578 --> 00:36:57.378
...was transferred into the surfboard
as you shaped it.

575
00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:59.678
What are your thoughts on that?

576
00:36:59.858 --> 00:37:03.148
What's up with the hair?
You could fit a whole fish in there.

577
00:37:03.328 --> 00:37:05.848
My dream surfboard.
It's pretty powerful.

578
00:37:06.028 --> 00:37:09.358
You can add a lot of attachments to it,
like a grenade launcher attachment.

579
00:37:09.528 --> 00:37:10.848
Anybody know whose board this is?

580
00:37:10.998 --> 00:37:13.868
- I'm pretty sure it's the chicken's.
- Has anybody seen the chicken?

581
00:37:14.038 --> 00:37:16.098
Cody!

582
00:37:16.408 --> 00:37:20.138
I know he's out here.
I can feel it in my nuggets.

583
00:37:20.308 --> 00:37:23.748
Aren't you nervous out here
in the jungle? It's kind of dangerous.

584
00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:27.508
Dude, the jungle is the most
peaceful place on the planet.

585
00:37:33.388 --> 00:37:36.588
- Hold it steady.
- This is a dream come true.

586
00:37:36.758 --> 00:37:39.888
This is a dream come true,
to be here with Z, doing this.

587
00:37:40.058 --> 00:37:42.048
- And it's koa wood.
- Where's the...

588
00:37:42.228 --> 00:37:44.198
All the best boards are made from koa wood.

589
00:37:44.728 --> 00:37:49.398
All right, now,
I drew this pattern as a guide.

590
00:37:49.568 --> 00:37:54.308
Do you want to have your board
with a lot of rocker or just a little?

591
00:37:55.038 --> 00:37:56.378
I don't know.

592
00:37:56.548 --> 00:37:59.568
What you want is something
in-between. Trust me.

593
00:37:59.748 --> 00:38:01.338
- I'm the expert here.
- Okay.

594
00:38:01.948 --> 00:38:03.207
So...

595
00:38:03.587 --> 00:38:05.707
...here are your shaping tools.

596
00:38:06.157 --> 00:38:10.957
Now, remember, the board's
already inside there, see, somewhere.

597
00:38:11.127 --> 00:38:14.457
And what you're doing
is you're trying to find it.

598
00:38:14.627 --> 00:38:17.287
- Reveal it. All right?
- Okay.

599
00:38:17.727 --> 00:38:21.167
Every carve counts.
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.

600
00:38:21.337 --> 00:38:25.327
- I'm not smiling. I'm excited.
- This isn't like hacking a piece of ice.

601
00:38:25.507 --> 00:38:27.907
It takes patience and finesse.

602
00:38:28.077 --> 00:38:31.337
All right already. Can you just
give me the tools, please?

603
00:38:31.507 --> 00:38:34.067
- Here, take it. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

604
00:38:35.017 --> 00:38:38.007
- Here we go.
- What are you doing?

605
00:38:39.357 --> 00:38:41.407
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

606
00:38:41.587 --> 00:38:44.747
All right, look.
First of all, with the grain.

607
00:38:44.987 --> 00:38:48.017
With the grain.
You see what I'm doing here?

608
00:38:48.257 --> 00:38:52.027
You let the tool do the work.
You see?

609
00:38:52.197 --> 00:38:55.027
Just like you're riding a wave.
You let the wave do the work.

610
00:38:55.197 --> 00:38:59.397
You don't fight the wave.
You can't fight these big waves.

611
00:38:59.577 --> 00:39:03.837
Long strokes. Loads of finesse.

612
00:39:04.807 --> 00:39:07.937
Find the board within the tree.

613
00:39:08.117 --> 00:39:11.207
- Nice and easy.
- Yeah, I got it.

614
00:39:11.387 --> 00:39:13.547
See that? You just...

615
00:39:14.057 --> 00:39:16.047
- You just...
- Maybe I could do it now.

616
00:39:16.227 --> 00:39:17.817
Move with...

617
00:39:18.827 --> 00:39:21.387
- With the...
- Can I do it now?

618
00:39:23.197 --> 00:39:24.757
Can I do it now?

619
00:39:27.836 --> 00:39:31.326
Yeah. I got carried away.
Sorry about that.

620
00:39:31.506 --> 00:39:33.526
- It's your board.
- My board.

621
00:39:34.476 --> 00:39:35.996
Okay, with the grain. I got it.

622
00:39:36.176 --> 00:39:38.406
Don't forget to eyeball it once in a while.

623
00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:42.236
- Long strokes, with the grain.
- Not too long.

624
00:39:42.416 --> 00:39:44.216
Here we go.

625
00:39:48.186 --> 00:39:50.586
- You're doing it wrong.
- Will you just let me...

626
00:39:50.756 --> 00:39:53.986
I can't... No finesse
when you're in my face. Okay?

627
00:39:54.156 --> 00:39:56.096
Just let me make the board.

628
00:39:56.266 --> 00:39:58.996
- Do you want my help?
- No, I don't want your help.

629
00:39:59.166 --> 00:40:00.496
I don't want your help.

630
00:40:00.666 --> 00:40:02.666
- You don't want my help?
- I don't want your help.

631
00:40:02.806 --> 00:40:05.866
- All right. Fine.
- I want to make my board.

632
00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:09.596
- Build the board yourself, all right?
- Thank you.

633
00:40:09.776 --> 00:40:13.076
I don't care what the board
looks like. You're the one...

634
00:40:13.246 --> 00:40:16.216
...who's got to ride the thing.
- Fine. Thank you.

635
00:40:17.346 --> 00:40:21.586
- It's in there somewhere.
- Walk over there, please! Please.

636
00:40:22.056 --> 00:40:24.316
Don't cut yourself.

637
00:40:25.626 --> 00:40:27.186
So it's day three, yeah?

638
00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:31.616
I come across Pen Guans.

639
00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:35.236
I'm Chicken Joe. Joseph.
It's long for Joe.

640
00:40:35.806 --> 00:40:36.966
Sweet, man.

641
00:40:37.136 --> 00:40:41.406
And they treat me as their king
and put me in a hot tub.

642
00:40:41.976 --> 00:40:44.606
It is, I guess, their royal hot tub.

643
00:41:00.055 --> 00:41:02.285
It got kind of hot and steamy.

644
00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:05.015
But really opened up my pores, you know?

645
00:41:07.235 --> 00:41:08.525
It was kind of cool.

646
00:41:08.695 --> 00:41:11.395
They served me food while I was in there.

647
00:41:11.605 --> 00:41:14.265
It was like dinner and a show.

648
00:41:24.785 --> 00:41:28.445
As enjoyable as it was,
I still had a vision of my quest.

649
00:41:30.585 --> 00:41:34.425
Thank you. See you guys later.
I gotta get going.

650
00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:37.785
Not again.

651
00:41:39.965 --> 00:41:42.025
You know what else it was?
I had the board.

652
00:41:42.195 --> 00:41:43.895
The board was fine.
The board was great.

653
00:41:47.235 --> 00:41:50.295
- How's it going?
- It's going great, man. It's great.

654
00:41:50.775 --> 00:41:52.265
It did look a little rough.

655
00:41:52.445 --> 00:41:55.845
A little rough? The board looked
a little... It's a work in progress, bro.

656
00:41:56.015 --> 00:41:57.915
You think it's good enough
for the big waves?

657
00:41:58.085 --> 00:42:01.485
I think it's good enough for any wave.

658
00:42:02.955 --> 00:42:04.445
Hang on.

659
00:42:05.325 --> 00:42:09.785
- Okay, let's say I'm a big wave.
- Hold on. No, no, no, no.

660
00:42:09.965 --> 00:42:11.794
- Hey, where you...
- Hold on!

661
00:42:11.964 --> 00:42:14.654
- Where are you going?
- It's my board, man, all right?

662
00:42:14.834 --> 00:42:17.804
Why don't you take your board
and go try it out?

663
00:42:17.964 --> 00:42:21.564
Maybe I will. Piece of junk. Watch!

664
00:42:24.804 --> 00:42:28.034
Nice ride, man.
Nice ride.

665
00:42:29.344 --> 00:42:31.244
This is supposed to be fun.

666
00:42:31.414 --> 00:42:35.144
I got three days until the contest.
I don't have time for fun.

667
00:42:35.784 --> 00:42:38.154
No time for fun, huh?

668
00:42:38.324 --> 00:42:39.784
- Hey, Cody!
- What?

669
00:42:39.954 --> 00:42:42.754
Bring me some clams when you come back!

670
00:42:42.924 --> 00:42:45.624
I'm not coming back!

671
00:42:45.794 --> 00:42:48.264
- He'll be back.
- No, I won't!

672
00:42:48.434 --> 00:42:50.024
He'll be back.

673
00:42:50.464 --> 00:42:52.594
- You guys like barbecue?
- Yeah, sure.

674
00:42:52.774 --> 00:42:54.324
Got some wood here.

675
00:42:55.174 --> 00:42:58.604
I wasted my whole day and I have
nothing to show for it, which is...

676
00:43:03.484 --> 00:43:07.544
- I was just going to check on you...
- That's why you were...

677
00:43:07.714 --> 00:43:09.014
...and the Geek.

678
00:43:09.184 --> 00:43:12.484
- Listen. The Geek is Big Z.
- What?

679
00:43:12.654 --> 00:43:13.884
- I know.
- You know?

680
00:43:14.054 --> 00:43:15.994
- How did you find out?
- We went to the beach.

681
00:43:16.164 --> 00:43:17.524
- You got him to the beach?
- Yeah.

682
00:43:17.564 --> 00:43:20.184
I've been trying to get Z
out of that tree for 10 years...

683
00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.734
...and you got him all the way
down to the beach in one day?

684
00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:24.424
This is fantastic!

685
00:43:26.734 --> 00:43:31.834
It's amazing!
Do you want to go somewhere fun?

686
00:43:32.044 --> 00:43:36.873
Do you want to go somewhere
really, really fun?

687
00:43:37.043 --> 00:43:39.673
Unless you want...
Did you want to get back to Big Z?

688
00:43:39.853 --> 00:43:42.213
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have invited you.
- No, no, no.

689
00:43:42.383 --> 00:43:45.323
- What? Okay. No?
- No, look. I want to have fun.

690
00:43:45.483 --> 00:43:47.753
- Okay.
- Do I need mints or something?

691
00:43:47.923 --> 00:43:50.893
- You tell me.
- No, you won't need mints.

692
00:43:51.623 --> 00:43:55.423
Z used to carry us up here on his
shoulders. We'd have so much fun.

693
00:43:55.593 --> 00:43:58.223
- It's one of my favorite spots.
- Really?

694
00:43:58.433 --> 00:44:01.333
- Boy, to be 8 years old again.
- What is this?

695
00:44:01.503 --> 00:44:03.493
You don't want to get all cut up, do you?

696
00:44:03.673 --> 00:44:05.003
Hold on. What are you doing?

697
00:44:05.173 --> 00:44:07.433
No, no, no. I'm out of here.
I'm better off...

698
00:44:18.953 --> 00:44:20.943
It's going down! No, no, no!

699
00:44:25.263 --> 00:44:29.323
- This is insane!
- Stop fighting it, Cody! Just let go!

700
00:44:31.433 --> 00:44:33.063
All right!

701
00:44:37.503 --> 00:44:40.173
Now I'm in front of you.
What's going on now?

702
00:44:40.343 --> 00:44:41.833
It's not a race!

703
00:44:50.623 --> 00:44:53.523
Okay, wait, don't take the left...
Cody!

704
00:44:58.192 --> 00:45:02.222
- Give up, slowpoke! It's over with now!
- Not for long!

705
00:45:02.562 --> 00:45:04.762
Give up now, sucker!

706
00:45:08.932 --> 00:45:12.272
- I beat you!
- Congratulations, you sure did.

707
00:45:12.442 --> 00:45:14.002
You should probably get out of there.

708
00:45:14.172 --> 00:45:16.532
Why is that? This stuff is...
Look at me. It's so beautiful.

709
00:45:16.612 --> 00:45:18.202
Look at it. What is this stuff?

710
00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.212
See those things up above you?
They're glowworms.

711
00:45:21.382 --> 00:45:25.842
So you're right beneath them.
Yeah, that's poop.

712
00:45:35.862 --> 00:45:39.632
You know how some stinks stink
and other stinks smell good?

713
00:45:39.802 --> 00:45:42.062
- Yeah.
- This is, like, a good stink.

714
00:45:42.232 --> 00:45:43.232
A good stink?

715
00:45:43.902 --> 00:45:45.632
Can I tell you something personal?

716
00:45:45.802 --> 00:45:48.162
We're in the shower together.
You can say whatever you want.

717
00:45:48.242 --> 00:45:52.682
I'm serious. I'm really, really
jealous of you.

718
00:45:52.852 --> 00:45:53.972
Why?

719
00:45:54.152 --> 00:45:58.012
I couldn't get Z off his butt
for the last 10 years...

720
00:45:58.182 --> 00:46:00.712
...and then you come along and...

721
00:46:00.892 --> 00:46:03.652
He must really think a lot of you.

722
00:46:03.822 --> 00:46:07.382
I don't know. I've been a jerk to him.
I don't know what he thinks.

723
00:46:07.562 --> 00:46:09.652
- You haven't.
- I have. I've been a jerk.

724
00:46:11.032 --> 00:46:14.402
- I have.
- Then go not be a jerk.

725
00:46:15.072 --> 00:46:16.832
What does it matter to you anyways?

726
00:46:17.002 --> 00:46:19.701
He's my uncle.
He's the only family I've got.

727
00:46:28.951 --> 00:46:30.351
Okay.

728
00:47:32.781 --> 00:47:34.511
Z? No.

729
00:47:35.181 --> 00:47:39.451
No, no, no, don't you do it.
Z, don't do it. No.

730
00:47:39.621 --> 00:47:41.481
- No.
- Let's see here.

731
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:43.520
- I swear...
- It's stronger than I thought.

732
00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:47.020
...if you break it...
- Should've been broken by now.

733
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.850
Come on! Come on!

734
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:55.290
Look at that.

735
00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.530
That's the best place
in the world to be, in the tube.

736
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:01.730
Really?

737
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:06.310
Yeah. Better than winning,
the trophy, all that stuff.

738
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.510
Tube riding
is the ultimate thing in surfing...

739
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.880
...to ride inside the wave
and make it out of it.

740
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:14.640
It's all we want to do every day.

741
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.760
It's almost impossible to describe.

742
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.860
There's nothing I can compare it to.

743
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:24.490
It's a feeling that not too many people
will experience...

744
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.660
...so it's special in that sense.

745
00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.200
Then you try to remember it.

746
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:31.300
Like, "I wish I could remember that,"
or "I wish I could get that again."

747
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.130
It's so addicting.

748
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.340
Once you get inside
you never want to get out.

749
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:43.000
- Wow. That's amazing.
- Yeah, man. Nothing like it.

750
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:48.680
So, that aside, how many points
would you get for getting tubed?

751
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:51.190
Like, what does it depend on
for the contest?

752
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.590
- Points?
- What?

753
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:56.280
You know who you sound like right now?

754
00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.220
I promote happiness!

755
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.030
Can you see the happiness emanating
from me? What's wrong with you?

756
00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.030
- We're live.
- Good. Good.

757
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:08.499
I have to say, I have no doubt
that this year's Big Z Memorial...

758
00:49:08.669 --> 00:49:10.009
...is gonna be the best ever.

759
00:49:11.409 --> 00:49:13.899
With the competition just one day away...

760
00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:18.569
...the excitement is definitely building
here on Pen Gu Island.

761
00:49:38.939 --> 00:49:42.299
That didn't take too long.
I feel lightheaded.

762
00:49:42.469 --> 00:49:43.699
So get this.

763
00:49:44.039 --> 00:49:48.099
On my search for Cody,
I bump into my hot tub buddies again.

764
00:49:49.449 --> 00:49:51.639
I get it. You guys look hungry.

765
00:49:51.819 --> 00:49:55.049
You've probably got
the munchies or something.

766
00:49:57.119 --> 00:49:59.389
Squidito on el stickito?

767
00:50:09.199 --> 00:50:13.069
Check it out! Dude,
have you seen my friend Cody?

768
00:50:13.239 --> 00:50:15.969
He's kind of like a penguin.

769
00:50:16.139 --> 00:50:19.239
He's got a lot of black on him,
a lot of white.

770
00:50:19.409 --> 00:50:22.899
- How did you learn how to surf?
- I saw Big Z do it, actually.

771
00:50:23.079 --> 00:50:24.979
I don't think you were born yet.

772
00:50:25.149 --> 00:50:27.549
- I wasn't?
- No, I don't think so.

773
00:50:27.819 --> 00:50:32.588
Lani? I like her when
she teaches us because...

774
00:50:32.758 --> 00:50:34.488
Smudge! Not another one!

775
00:50:34.658 --> 00:50:37.178
I think he really has to go
to the bathroom right now.

776
00:50:37.828 --> 00:50:39.558
What's next? The board is done.

777
00:50:39.728 --> 00:50:41.628
- The board is done?
- The board is done.

778
00:50:41.798 --> 00:50:45.698
- Well, let's do some training.
- Finally!

779
00:50:46.038 --> 00:50:49.128
- Can we get a shot of you...
- You've got to get it in a long shot.

780
00:50:50.178 --> 00:50:52.668
Hey, Z! Come on!

781
00:50:52.838 --> 00:50:54.938
- Where you going?
- I thought we were going to train.

782
00:50:54.948 --> 00:50:58.398
Not in the water. Jeez.
What are you thinking?

783
00:50:59.818 --> 00:51:02.948
- You want to surf like Big Z used to?
- Yeah.

784
00:51:03.118 --> 00:51:05.818
I've got some tests here
to figure out your potential.

785
00:51:05.988 --> 00:51:08.518
- Let's do it.
- No, put them on your eyes.

786
00:51:08.688 --> 00:51:11.178
- Like this.
- On my eyes.

787
00:51:13.898 --> 00:51:16.928
- Take it, Cody.
- Can we do some training, seriously?

788
00:51:17.098 --> 00:51:19.379
What are you talking about?
What do you think we're doing?

789
00:51:19.398 --> 00:51:21.478
Acting like nutjobs.
That's what I think we're doing.

790
00:51:21.608 --> 00:51:24.008
Yeah, good. You're learning!

791
00:51:24.178 --> 00:51:26.198
And a big set comes in.

792
00:51:28.578 --> 00:51:30.278
Wipeout!

793
00:51:30.618 --> 00:51:32.518
- That's it!
- Take it easy!

794
00:51:32.978 --> 00:51:34.578
This is getting ridiculous.

795
00:51:34.748 --> 00:51:36.188
- You having fun?
- I hate you.

796
00:51:37.288 --> 00:51:38.718
Big, you know, slow:

797
00:51:40.628 --> 00:51:43.718
He does this flip over the top.
All right, now you go.

798
00:51:45.828 --> 00:51:48.728
No joy, man. No joy. Fail.

799
00:51:49.698 --> 00:51:54.367
I'm starting to see it, man. I think
I know what you're talking about.

800
00:51:55.307 --> 00:51:58.367
That's great. As long as
we're all having fun, right?

801
00:51:58.637 --> 00:52:02.837
Z, wake up. Wake up, Z. Z!

802
00:52:11.457 --> 00:52:13.417
Hey, Z, breakfast!

803
00:52:15.427 --> 00:52:16.787
Not a chance.

804
00:52:17.127 --> 00:52:20.717
- Four, three, two...
- You gotta get up early in the morning...

805
00:52:21.297 --> 00:52:22.387
...one.

806
00:52:31.337 --> 00:52:32.337
That is fun.

807
00:52:32.507 --> 00:52:35.447
- You're having fun?
- I am. Yes. Now I am.

808
00:52:36.007 --> 00:52:37.207
Then, Cody...

809
00:52:37.377 --> 00:52:39.037
...you passed!
- What?

810
00:52:39.217 --> 00:52:41.707
You did it! You're ready! Let's surf!

811
00:52:41.887 --> 00:52:46.417
Don't play me, Z. We're surfing?
Yes! Yes!

812
00:52:57.097 --> 00:52:58.567
Hey, check it...

813
00:53:05.277 --> 00:53:07.397
I didn't know you could surf!

814
00:53:13.647 --> 00:53:14.876
Relax!

815
00:53:15.046 --> 00:53:18.746
Long, slow, smooth.

816
00:53:18.916 --> 00:53:20.756
- Like making the board!
- There you go.

817
00:53:20.926 --> 00:53:23.856
- All right. Okay.
- Feels good, yeah?

818
00:53:35.066 --> 00:53:39.936
- You're in the water, Z!
- Come on out. Get wet! Come on!

819
00:53:44.416 --> 00:53:48.106
Lani, thank you.

820
00:53:54.026 --> 00:53:55.786
Look at that!

821
00:54:08.906 --> 00:54:12.566
- Nice! That's it! Nice.
- Great ride!

822
00:54:37.935 --> 00:54:39.725
Big Z is back!

823
00:54:51.045 --> 00:54:53.515
This is what it's all about.

824
00:54:54.315 --> 00:54:56.835
What could be better than this?

825
00:55:23.715 --> 00:55:26.305
I need some help
on this landing for the high note

826
00:55:30.815 --> 00:55:33.615
Nice. Nice.

827
00:55:33.985 --> 00:55:36.085
- Is that the only song that you know?
- Pretty much.

828
00:55:36.255 --> 00:55:38.725
You want to hear it again?
It goes like this.

829
00:55:38.955 --> 00:55:41.625
No? Okay. I got you there, didn't I?

830
00:55:41.795 --> 00:55:45.455
I must say you were
quite amazing out there today.

831
00:55:45.635 --> 00:55:48.395
- You weren't so bad yourself, kiddo.
- Thanks to this guy.

832
00:55:49.235 --> 00:55:53.795
- I just pointed you in a direction.
- Question, Z.

833
00:55:54.975 --> 00:55:56.995
- Change your mind about the song?
- No, no, no.

834
00:55:57.175 --> 00:55:58.645
Here, it goes something like this...

835
00:55:58.815 --> 00:56:01.544
I was wondering if you could come
watch me ride tomorrow.

836
00:56:03.144 --> 00:56:05.544
Yeah, yeah. We'll both ride, man.

837
00:56:05.714 --> 00:56:10.384
- No, not just... In the contest.
- Contest? What contest?

838
00:56:10.554 --> 00:56:12.754
The Big Z Memorial.
Remember that one?

839
00:56:12.924 --> 00:56:14.554
I know I'm asking a lot...

840
00:56:14.724 --> 00:56:17.124
...but it would really, really be...

841
00:56:17.294 --> 00:56:20.424
...the biggest thing in the world
to me if you could come.

842
00:56:22.504 --> 00:56:25.334
- You still want to be a part of that?
- Absolutely.

843
00:56:25.904 --> 00:56:30.364
- Why do you want me there anyway?
- I thought you'd want to be there.

844
00:56:30.544 --> 00:56:33.514
- I don't know why it's a big deal.
- It's no big deal.

845
00:56:33.814 --> 00:56:35.614
Why won't you come?

846
00:56:35.844 --> 00:56:37.114
- I'm not coming.
- Why?

847
00:56:37.284 --> 00:56:39.084
- Give it a rest.
- It's getting cold, guys.

848
00:56:39.254 --> 00:56:40.814
- Tell me why you're hiding.
- Hiding?

849
00:56:40.984 --> 00:56:43.354
- Why are you hiding?
- I'll have to eat all this by myself.

850
00:56:43.524 --> 00:56:45.654
Why didn't you come back
after you fell off the wave?

851
00:56:46.724 --> 00:56:48.854
That wave.

852
00:56:50.694 --> 00:56:55.824
That last day, winning had
become everything to me.

853
00:56:56.164 --> 00:56:57.794
I knew I was gonna beat Tank.

854
00:56:59.104 --> 00:57:05.274
But then, you know,
he starts to surf circles around me.

855
00:57:05.444 --> 00:57:08.504
I saw what he was doing.
I couldn't do what he was doing.

856
00:57:09.314 --> 00:57:11.614
Times had changed.

857
00:57:12.714 --> 00:57:15.554
I didn't want to walk back
on that beach with all my fans there.

858
00:57:15.724 --> 00:57:20.184
A loser. Everyone looking
at Big Z, the loser, the has-been.

859
00:57:20.764 --> 00:57:22.424
So...

860
00:57:30.673 --> 00:57:33.573
Big Z's dead,
and that's how it's gonna stay.

861
00:57:34.203 --> 00:57:36.363
Let me play you that song.

862
00:57:37.573 --> 00:57:40.543
What about "never give up"?
What about "find a way"?

863
00:57:40.883 --> 00:57:45.813
- You're giving up. You're giving up!
- Yeah, I'm giving up. That's my way.

864
00:57:46.283 --> 00:57:49.553
- Giving up.
- I thought you were the one guy.

865
00:57:49.723 --> 00:57:52.693
You don't like it, find your own way.

866
00:57:54.463 --> 00:57:55.983
Leave me out of it.

867
00:57:56.793 --> 00:57:58.383
Leave me out of it.

868
00:58:25.953 --> 00:58:28.453
I messed up.
I'm just...

869
00:58:28.663 --> 00:58:30.653
I'm... not good.

870
00:58:31.063 --> 00:58:33.793
This is when I needed someone.
I needed him.

871
00:58:34.833 --> 00:58:37.733
It's hard enough losing one dad, but...

872
00:58:38.803 --> 00:58:41.233
- What do you mean by...?
- Nothing.

873
00:58:41.443 --> 00:58:43.733
Nothing, man. Forget it.

874
00:58:58.322 --> 00:59:00.622
Peaceful. Peaceful.
I'm in peace. I come in peace.

875
00:59:00.822 --> 00:59:01.982
- Cody!
- Joe!

876
00:59:02.392 --> 00:59:05.692
- I've been looking everywhere for you!
- You've been looking for me?

877
00:59:05.862 --> 00:59:08.692
I didn't lose you on the whale.
I'm not gonna lose you now.

878
00:59:08.862 --> 00:59:12.302
- Thank you. Seriously, thank you.
- Radical.

879
00:59:14.542 --> 00:59:17.002
They're starting!
Cody, we gotta go! Come on!

880
00:59:17.212 --> 00:59:18.672
Wait a minute. Joe?

881
00:59:18.842 --> 00:59:19.932
Surfers riding...

882
00:59:20.112 --> 00:59:23.132
I'm sorry. Watch this, dude.
I can speak their language.

883
00:59:27.052 --> 00:59:30.252
I totally need my board. I don't
know where it is. I gotta go find it.

884
00:59:30.422 --> 00:59:32.612
- I'll see you in the lineup.
- See you, Joe.

885
00:59:32.792 --> 00:59:35.312
- This is gonna be fun, huh?
- See you.

886
00:59:36.932 --> 00:59:40.622
The tenth annual Big Z
is about to get underway...

887
00:59:40.802 --> 00:59:43.592
...and, whoa, it is the day of days.

888
00:59:43.772 --> 00:59:46.962
Big mountainous bombs
marching into our coastline.

889
00:59:47.272 --> 00:59:50.902
Kelly Slater, on a danger level,
one to ten, give me a number.

890
00:59:51.072 --> 00:59:52.072
Twenty.

891
00:59:52.242 --> 00:59:54.272
- Wow. Rob?
- There'll be blood.

892
00:59:54.442 --> 00:59:56.382
I'm scared, and I'm in the booth!

893
00:59:57.352 --> 00:59:59.512
- What are you doing here?
- Mike.

894
00:59:59.682 --> 01:00:01.952
You're gonna kill yourself.
Don't do this to yourself.

895
01:00:02.122 --> 01:00:03.452
Look what happened last time.

896
01:00:04.152 --> 01:00:06.422
- It's good to see you back.
- Are you serious?

897
01:00:06.592 --> 01:00:08.112
You're gonna be a real crowd pleaser.

898
01:00:08.292 --> 01:00:10.621
I'm telling you,
these people are gonna eat you up.

899
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:14.281
- I'll be expecting big things from you.
- Thank you.

900
01:00:14.461 --> 01:00:16.691
People, big announcement.
Cody Maverick, he's back.

901
01:00:16.861 --> 01:00:18.201
The Wipeout King is back...

902
01:00:18.371 --> 01:00:20.571
...and I'm gonna tell you,
start looking for the sharks.

903
01:00:20.641 --> 01:00:22.691
They'll be circling because
there's gonna be blood.

904
01:00:22.871 --> 01:00:24.301
Spectacular carnage today.

905
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:28.411
Thank you! Reggie Belafonte. Little
guy, big hair, big thoughts, big heart.

906
01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:41.241
Look at this.
You're going down, snowflake.

907
01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:45.651
I'm gonna make you wish
you were never even hatched.

908
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:49.321
You want to see my trophies?

909
01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:00.771
Arnold, no.

910
01:01:06.781 --> 01:01:09.771
About 24 surfers
battling their way out to the...

911
01:01:10.821 --> 01:01:13.621
Good golly! Make that 18.

912
01:01:16.891 --> 01:01:19.291
Rob, after such a heavy wipeout
earlier in the week...

913
01:01:19.461 --> 01:01:21.581
...what do you think is going
through Maverick's mind?

914
01:01:21.661 --> 01:01:25.661
He's gonna have to stay focused and
channel that energy into good places.

915
01:01:25.971 --> 01:01:27.631
When are you gonna get a life?

916
01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:31.800
You are a nobody.

917
01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:35.300
You should've stayed in Antarctica, kid.

918
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:02.730
He made it! Yeah, good.

919
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.770
What an amazing first ride
mind-blower from Maverick.

920
01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.140
Did you guys see that?

921
01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.410
Man. I thought I was gonna lose it,
and then I just...

922
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:21.550
I just let go, you know.
I let go, and there it was.

923
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.490
Wow, it's been an amazing day...

924
01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.650
...of shredding in less than
stellar conditions...

925
01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:30.760
...but I never would have guessed
our three finalists.

926
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:33.060
Well, Sal, it's no surprise
that Tank Evans...

927
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:36.330
...has just breezed his way
into the finals.

928
01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:40.800
And Cody Maverick, from a horrible
wipeout a few days ago to this.

929
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.410
And Chicken Joe from Sheboygan.
Who would have guessed it?

930
01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:50.350
I have never seen a finals like this.

931
01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:54.110
- We're in the finals, Joe.
- No way! We get to surf some more?

932
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:57.619
Isn't it exciting?
Look at that. This is great, huh?

933
01:02:57.889 --> 01:03:01.229
You know, you should know this.
The Tank loves you.

934
01:03:02.129 --> 01:03:04.559
Looks like this will be
the easiest year ever.

935
01:03:05.629 --> 01:03:08.659
No way. Cody, did you hear that?
It's gonna be easy.

936
01:03:09.399 --> 01:03:12.069
Are you loving this?

937
01:03:14.479 --> 01:03:16.409
So who would you like
to see win the trophy?

938
01:03:16.579 --> 01:03:19.169
It's not so important to me.

939
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:22.009
Friends are better than anything
in the world.

940
01:03:22.179 --> 01:03:23.379
Friends are forever.

941
01:03:24.019 --> 01:03:27.319
Trophies, you never know
what they can have happen to them.

942
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:31.419
- That was awesome, mate.
- Muy impresivo, my friend.

943
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:32.919
Thank you, bro. Thanks.

944
01:03:33.689 --> 01:03:35.089
- Finals.
- Hey!

945
01:03:35.259 --> 01:03:37.929
Yeah. I know. I can't even...

946
01:03:38.869 --> 01:03:41.529
I think I can win this thing.
It's too much right now.

947
01:03:41.699 --> 01:03:44.189
- Well, that's all you came for.
- What?

948
01:03:44.369 --> 01:03:47.469
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You made it pretty clear last night...

949
01:03:47.639 --> 01:03:49.719
...that winning's more important
to you than Z or me.

950
01:03:49.879 --> 01:03:52.279
But, hey, maybe you'll get to take
your stupid trophy home.

951
01:03:52.449 --> 01:03:54.849
- Lani. Come on.
- Come here, you!

952
01:03:55.319 --> 01:03:56.649
How about this, huh?

953
01:03:56.819 --> 01:04:01.879
Let me tell you something. You win
this thing, we're going places!

954
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:04.989
Look at this kid.
He is a champ!

955
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:18.728
Tank, nine-time defending champion.
He will roll on you.

956
01:04:18.908 --> 01:04:22.398
Expect him to win this thing. It's
basically a contest for second place.

957
01:04:22.578 --> 01:04:27.238
First, I'm gonna take you down.
Then I'm gonna fry the chicken.

958
01:04:29.418 --> 01:04:32.318
That cloud looks just like a kitten.

959
01:04:45.828 --> 01:04:47.628
Maverick and Evans take off.

960
01:04:48.338 --> 01:04:49.358
Mine!

961
01:04:49.538 --> 01:04:51.868
And it's Evans dropping in.

962
01:04:54.638 --> 01:04:57.628
And Tank's playing games,
blocking Maverick's every move.

963
01:04:58.578 --> 01:05:00.098
Maverick sticks a rail.

964
01:05:01.318 --> 01:05:06.008
Tank Evans down!
I have never, ever seen this before!

965
01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:09.478
But I'd love to see it again.

966
01:05:09.658 --> 01:05:13.288
Cody trying to take back the wave
that Tank snaked from him.

967
01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:15.758
Evans toying with him,
not paying attention.

968
01:05:15.928 --> 01:05:18.158
And there's the outside rail.
Evans goes down.

969
01:05:18.328 --> 01:05:22.858
And it's Maverick with this new-school
move. We'll call it "The Maverick."

970
01:05:28.678 --> 01:05:31.838
And look at this.
Maverick scoring big.

971
01:05:32.908 --> 01:05:37.348
Oh, it's so cute.
It's got little paws and the whiskers.

972
01:05:40.317 --> 01:05:43.147
Chicken Joe with a no-paddle drop-in!

973
01:05:44.827 --> 01:05:47.657
- Here we go!
- Nobody needs to help this chicken.

974
01:05:48.697 --> 01:05:49.917
I'm flying!

975
01:05:51.497 --> 01:05:56.597
Maverick and Joe tied, and no score
for Tank Evans? Unbelievable.

976
01:05:58.207 --> 01:06:02.067
Surfers, this is your final wave!

977
01:06:02.237 --> 01:06:06.577
- Joe, this is it. This wave wins it.
- Yeah, man!

978
01:06:08.577 --> 01:06:12.917
This wave is stacking up
to be a beautiful tube.

979
01:06:13.547 --> 01:06:16.787
Maverick should score big on this one!

980
01:06:18.627 --> 01:06:20.957
But wait! Evans drops in.

981
01:06:21.127 --> 01:06:24.717
It looks like Evans
is gonna take out the chicken.

982
01:06:30.137 --> 01:06:31.467
What's Maverick doing?

983
01:06:31.637 --> 01:06:34.537
- Go, Joe, go!
- Got it! Let's go!

984
01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:37.607
I don't believe this.
This contest was Maverick's to win.

985
01:06:37.807 --> 01:06:41.537
Now Evans pushing Maverick out
of bounds and into The Boneyards.

986
01:06:54.257 --> 01:06:57.087
- Tank, look out!
- You look out!

987
01:07:32.466 --> 01:07:33.466
Code!

988
01:07:35.996 --> 01:07:36.996
Z!

989
01:07:41.136 --> 01:07:43.036
- Cody, come on.
- Z!

990
01:07:43.206 --> 01:07:46.976
Paddle! Come on! Dig! Faster!
Come on. Dig!

991
01:07:48.216 --> 01:07:50.616
Don't dig! Don't dig!

992
01:07:50.786 --> 01:07:51.876
What?

993
01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:55.076
Let the wave carry you!

994
01:07:55.716 --> 01:07:57.376
You're gonna have to time it!

995
01:07:57.926 --> 01:08:01.046
You're gonna come right here, right to me!

996
01:08:04.596 --> 01:08:06.586
Five... four...

997
01:08:06.826 --> 01:08:09.426
Three... two... one.

998
01:08:14.506 --> 01:08:15.976
Z!

999
01:08:31.255 --> 01:08:32.815
Where's Cody?

1000
01:08:37.195 --> 01:08:39.255
Don't touch it! Don't touch that!

1001
01:08:39.425 --> 01:08:42.525
This is a reminder of the young surfer...

1002
01:08:42.695 --> 01:08:47.765
...who gave his life
for the sport he loved.

1003
01:08:51.975 --> 01:08:53.775
There you are.

1004
01:08:58.545 --> 01:09:01.845
I can't believe it! I can't believe it.

1005
01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:04.385
You came back.

1006
01:09:04.885 --> 01:09:07.545
You saved my life, man.
Thank you.

1007
01:09:07.725 --> 01:09:11.095
Hey, hey, come on.
You're gonna tip us!

1008
01:09:12.925 --> 01:09:15.555
Well, I lost.

1009
01:09:17.235 --> 01:09:18.925
Me too.

1010
01:09:21.075 --> 01:09:24.065
Come on. Let's go, loser.

1011
01:09:24.905 --> 01:09:26.275
You want to help me out here?

1012
01:09:26.445 --> 01:09:31.575
You know the routine. Come on. Long.
That's it. Smooth, you know. Come on.

1013
01:09:31.915 --> 01:09:36.905
Young Joey MacEnroe
was a beacon for a new generation.

1014
01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:40.055
May he rest in peace.

1015
01:09:41.955 --> 01:09:45.015
So, what am I bid for the board?
Who'll give me 30? 30, come on.

1016
01:09:45.195 --> 01:09:47.476
- Don't touch his stuff, man.
- Pal, if you want to bid...

1017
01:09:47.535 --> 01:09:49.724
- Give me that.
- Hey...!

1018
01:09:55.474 --> 01:09:57.204
Hey. Hey, everyone.

1019
01:09:58.204 --> 01:10:00.504
- How you been?
- Oh, my gosh!

1020
01:10:00.704 --> 01:10:02.874
- Yeah...
- Hey, man, that's Z.

1021
01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:04.634
...that's me.

1022
01:10:04.814 --> 01:10:07.044
Skank, what's happening, man?

1023
01:10:07.214 --> 01:10:09.874
Got a little sand
in your egg sac there, fella.

1024
01:10:10.054 --> 01:10:12.384
- Where have you been, Z?
- What happened?

1025
01:10:13.254 --> 01:10:14.584
Oh, you know...

1026
01:10:16.554 --> 01:10:21.554
...I got lost for a little while.
But that kid there, Cody...

1027
01:10:22.764 --> 01:10:25.594
...he pointed the way back.

1028
01:10:36.444 --> 01:10:38.764
Could you please shut that off?
Could you give me a minute?

1029
01:10:45.024 --> 01:10:46.954
Check it out! How about this?

1030
01:10:47.124 --> 01:10:49.594
You want to talk about talent scout?
People find talent.

1031
01:10:49.794 --> 01:10:55.454
I bring them back from the dead.
The now living legend, ladies and...

1032
01:10:55.634 --> 01:10:56.964
- Shut up.
- What? Shut up?

1033
01:10:57.134 --> 01:11:01.124
I'm not a legend. I'm a guy looking for
some nice waves, some good friends.

1034
01:11:01.634 --> 01:11:05.264
Hey, guys, the swell is happening
over on the north shore!

1035
01:11:05.444 --> 01:11:06.804
I'm right behind you, Z.

1036
01:11:06.974 --> 01:11:08.304
Ouch, that hurt.

1037
01:11:10.444 --> 01:11:14.713
Come back here!
You don't just walk away! Come on!

1038
01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:17.453
He's taking this loss pretty hard.

1039
01:11:17.623 --> 01:11:20.583
Tank, how does it feel
to lose after nine time...

1040
01:11:22.223 --> 01:11:25.453
I wasn't kissing her.
You can't have her!

1041
01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:29.993
Can we get a few words?

1042
01:11:30.163 --> 01:11:32.823
You gave up the trophy to help Joe.
What's that about?

1043
01:11:33.003 --> 01:11:35.903
You know, Rob, that's what friends do.

1044
01:11:36.073 --> 01:11:39.193
- How's it feel to win, Joe?
- I won?

1045
01:11:39.373 --> 01:11:42.673
Come on! I'll tell my mom.
Gimme. Gimme!

1046
01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:47.213
Oh, Lia! Oh, Lia.

1047
01:11:47.383 --> 01:11:50.973
Don't you walk away from me!
I am Reggie Belafon...

1048
01:11:52.483 --> 01:11:56.013
Turn that thing off.
Mikey! You are so fired!

1049
01:11:56.623 --> 01:11:59.253
I can't imagine a better day.

1050
01:12:05.433 --> 01:12:09.423
Dude, this... This whole
experience has just been...

1051
01:12:09.633 --> 01:12:12.533
It's amazing. Z?

1052
01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:17.613
I don't think I've ever had
a better friend to me in my life.

1053
01:12:17.783 --> 01:12:21.443
It's just really cool
to have everything I need.

1054
01:12:22.313 --> 01:12:24.783
- Don't do it. Help!
- Arnold!

1055
01:12:24.953 --> 01:12:28.353
To be honest, man, I'm kind of, like,
bored of talking about myself.

1056
01:12:28.523 --> 01:12:32.183
So, is that cool?
You guys got what you need?

1057
01:12:32.363 --> 01:12:34.652
- We got it.
- All right. Be good!

1058
01:12:43.272 --> 01:12:44.792
Cowabunga!

1059
01:13:52.842 --> 01:13:54.772
Of course we're proud of him!

1060
01:13:54.942 --> 01:13:56.772
What mother wouldn't be proud of him?

1061
01:13:56.942 --> 01:13:59.201
We're so full of proudness.

1062
01:13:59.381 --> 01:14:01.281
You know what?
He followed his dream...

1063
01:14:01.451 --> 01:14:05.211
...and he went out there, and now
he's coming home with the trophy.

1064
01:14:05.381 --> 01:14:07.371
I can't wait to see his trophy.

1065
01:14:07.551 --> 01:14:09.541
There's not really a trophy.

1066
01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:12.721
Is there, like, a big shell
or something like that?

1067
01:14:12.891 --> 01:14:15.621
There's no shell. There's no trophy.
Well, he didn't win.

1068
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:16.821
What?

1069
01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:20.191
How bad was it?
Did he get smoked?

1070
01:14:20.401 --> 01:14:23.561
- He was in the finals.
- Second place? That's losing.

1071
01:14:23.731 --> 01:14:26.071
- Winning is not everything, Glen.
- Right.

1072
01:14:26.241 --> 01:14:27.731
Look at what Cody did...

1073
01:14:27.911 --> 01:14:30.071
Go back to the
"winning isn't everything" thing.

1074
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:32.571
That doesn't compute, really.

1075
01:14:32.741 --> 01:14:38.241
You know what, Glen? I really hope
someday you can be more like Cody.

1076
01:14:38.721 --> 01:14:40.181
This interview is over.
