<b>All the birds of the feather</b>

<b>Do what they love most of all</b>

3
00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:45.607
<b>We are the best at
rhythm and laughter</b>

4
00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:48.111
<b>That's why we love Carnival</b>

5

<b>Some adventures reborn</b>

<b>Get up and join in the fun</b>

<b>Dancing with strangers,
don't mess with danger</b>

12
00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:16.020
<b>Magic could happen for Rio</b>

13

<b>In Rio, all by itself</b>

14
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:24.555
<b>Your dancing and knowing</b>

15

<b>You can't find it anywhere else</b>

16
00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:31.335
<b>Yes Rio, in Rio</b>

17
00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:34.670
<b>You know something else</b>

18
00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:38.111
<b>You can feel it happening</b>

19
00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.941
<b>You can feel it all by yourself</b>

20
00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.848
<b>It's okay, it's okay.</b>

21
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.145
<b>Shhh.</b>

22
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.129
<b>I'll take care of you.</b>

23
00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.314
<b>Stupid clock!</b>

24
00:05:32.662 --> 00:05:34.539
<b>Good morning Blu.</b>

25
00:05:50.848 --> 00:05:51.651
<b>You...</b>

26
00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:53.146
<b>Tyler Blu Gandersen.</b>

27
00:05:53.356 --> 00:05:55.603
<b>You know these vitamins
are good for you.</b>

28
00:05:56.854 --> 00:05:58.773
<b>Uuh, what's this?</b>

29
00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:00.942
<b>Gotcha.</b>

30
00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:19.378
<b>Arghhh!</b>

31
00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:38.941
<b>Enjoy the new book.</b>

32
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.067
<b>Thanks Linda.</b>

33
00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:41.443
<b>Bye now.</b>

34
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.134
<b>Yes, Mum. I love to visit.</b>

35
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:45.823
<b>But who'll take care of Blu?</b>

36
00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:49.577
<b>Mum, they don't have
candles for parrots.</b>

37
00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:52.017
<b>Here's your hot chocolate, Blu.</b>

38
00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:54.165
<b>Just how you like it.</b>

39
00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:57.335
<b>Because I don't trust leaving
Blu with just anyone.</b>

40
00:06:57.377 --> 00:06:59.233
<b>No, I don't have a bird sitter.</b>

41
00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:00.547
<b>What is a bird sitter...</b>

42
00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:02.549
<b>This is the life.</b>

43
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.719
<b>The perfect marshmallow
to cocoa ratio.</b>

44
00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:08.243
<b>One, two, three,
four, five,...Six!</b>

45
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.338
<b>Well, if it isn't my
favorite nerd bird.</b>

46
00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:21.257
<b>Very funny, real mature.</b>

47
00:07:21.277 --> 00:07:24.502
<b>Hey Pet, where are you
migrating to this year?</b>

48
00:07:24.503 --> 00:07:26.275
<b>The 'broad-first' nook?</b>

49
00:07:27.743 --> 00:07:29.453
<b>Throw all the snow
balls you want.</b>

50
00:07:29.578 --> 00:07:33.165
<b>I'm protected by this magical
force field, called "glass".</b>

51
00:07:33.374 --> 00:07:35.724
<b>It's what keep us so
toasty and warm in here,</b>

52
00:07:35.725 --> 00:07:37.628
<b>while you guys are out
there freezing your...</b>

53
00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:41.862
<b>Classy.</b>

54
00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:50.101
<b>Ara-ara! Ara-ara!</b>

55
00:07:57.128 --> 00:07:58.776
<b>Are you all right?</b>

56
00:08:00.632 --> 00:08:02.884
<b>I'm not really built
for this weather.</b>

57
00:08:02.926 --> 00:08:05.032
<b>Oh, are you looking
for some books?</b>

58
00:08:05.178 --> 00:08:06.179
<b>Books?</b>

59
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.827
<b>No, no.</b>

60
00:08:08.015 --> 00:08:11.518
<b>I've come six thousand
miles looking for him.</b>

61
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.190
<b>Doctor of Ornithology?</b>

62
00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:18.985
<b>Ooh, he's magnificent.</b>

63
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.970
<b>Linda, a little
help here. Linda!</b>

64
00:08:27.953 --> 00:08:30.831
<b>Wow, you're actually
communicating.</b>

65
00:08:30.914 --> 00:08:33.709
<b>Yes, I introduced myself and
shook my tail feathers,</b>

66
00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:36.462
<b>counter-clockwise, thus
referring to his dominance.</b>

67
00:08:37.087 --> 00:08:38.630
<b>I did not get that at all.</b>

68
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:40.424
<b>So, Dr Monteiro.</b>

69
00:08:40.425 --> 00:08:43.226
<b>No Dr. please, just
call me Tulio.</b>

70
00:08:43.344 --> 00:08:46.139
<b>You know your Macaw is
a very special bird.</b>

71
00:08:46.431 --> 00:08:48.391
<b>In fact, as far as we know,</b>

72
00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:50.915
<b>Blu is the last
male of his kind.</b>

73
00:08:51.353 --> 00:08:52.979
<b>Really? - Yes.</b>

74
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:54.752
<b>Recently we found a female.</b>

75
00:08:54.753 --> 00:08:58.569
<b>And our hope is to bring the two of
them together to save their species.</b>

76
00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:03.616
<b>Well sure, when can
she come over?</b>

77
00:09:03.657 --> 00:09:05.510
<b>Oh, no, she is in Brazil.</b>

78
00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:07.773
<b>Blu must come to Rio De Janeiro.</b>

79
00:09:10.206 --> 00:09:12.375
<b>Rio, Brazil?</b>

80
00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.253
<b>Oh, no, no, no, no.</b>

81
00:09:15.628 --> 00:09:17.729
<b>I never let Blu out of my sight.</b>

82
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.852
<b>He needs me.</b>

83
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:21.082
<b>Oh no. You misunderstand.</b>

84
00:09:21.113 --> 00:09:24.805
<b>It's all arranged. You'll be
with him every step of the way.</b>

85
00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:26.932
<b>And I'll be with you.</b>

86
00:09:27.516 --> 00:09:30.895
<b>Look, I know you're
doing your job.</b>

87
00:09:30.936 --> 00:09:33.523
<b>But... well, Blu's
very particular...</b>

88
00:09:33.564 --> 00:09:36.218
<b>And we have our
little routine here</b>

89
00:09:36.219 --> 00:09:38.095
<b>and we're not big on travel.</b>

90
00:09:38.528 --> 00:09:40.905
<b>Heck, he doesn't even fly.</b>

91
00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:42.488
<b>Of course he can fly.</b>

92
00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:44.764
<b>He's a perfect specimen.</b>

93
00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:45.952
<b>What are you doing?</b>

94
00:09:45.963 --> 00:09:48.194
<b>Don't worry, their natural
instincts always take over.</b>

95
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.644
<b>Wait, no!</b>

96
00:09:51.542 --> 00:09:53.210
<b>Well, almost always.</b>

97
00:09:53.294 --> 00:09:54.670
<b>Blu!</b>

98
00:09:55.317 --> 00:09:56.683
<b>What kind of doctor are you?</b>

99
00:09:56.693 --> 00:09:58.195
<b>Are you okay?</b>

100
00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:00.364
<b>Perhaps he's too domesticated.</b>

101
00:10:01.073 --> 00:10:03.325
<b>It was very nice
of you to step in,</b>

102
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.995
<b>squawk around and throw my bird,</b>

103
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.663
<b>but now it is time
for you to go.</b>

104
00:10:07.705 --> 00:10:08.852
<b>I'm very sorry.</b>

105
00:10:08.998 --> 00:10:11.751
<b>I'm very sorry, but wait, Linda.</b>

106
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.274
<b>This could be our last chance.</b>

107
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.132
<b>Have a safe flight.</b>

108
00:10:19.175 --> 00:10:21.574
<b>Linda, please listen to me!</b>

109
00:10:21.595 --> 00:10:26.016
<b>If we don't do this, his
whole species will be gone.</b>

110
00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.669
<b>Just think about it.</b>

111
00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:39.822
<b>Natural instincts.</b>

112
00:10:40.114 --> 00:10:43.410
<b>There is nothing natural about being
thrown half way across the room.</b>

113
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.995
<b>Hah, I'll show him.</b>

114
00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:48.498
<b>I can do this. I just have
to work out the physics.</b>

115
00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:50.672
<b>I have quadrated
my vector angles.</b>

116
00:10:51.403 --> 00:10:54.473
<b>I have adjusted for wind shear,
house every reinforcement.</b>

117
00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:55.777
<b>Good.</b>

118
00:10:56.549 --> 00:10:58.801
<b>Okay, let's see.</b>

119
00:10:58.905 --> 00:11:00.595
<b>Flaps open, perfect.</b>

120
00:11:00.803 --> 00:11:02.430
<b>Landing gear, checked.</b>

121
00:11:02.513 --> 00:11:04.896
<b>Tail flaps, operational.</b>

122
00:11:04.897 --> 00:11:07.873
<b>And actually, not bad.</b>

123
00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:11.857
<b>This is it. Let's fly.</b>

124
00:11:14.192 --> 00:11:15.694
<b>Just keep it simple.</b>

125
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.864
<b>Thrust, lift, drag, and wait.</b>

126
00:11:19.031 --> 00:11:20.866
<b>Thrust, lift, drag, wait!</b>

127
00:11:20.908 --> 00:11:22.243
<b>Thrust, lift, drag, wait!</b>

128
00:11:22.284 --> 00:11:24.495
<b>Thrust, lift, drag, wait!</b>

129
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:29.834
<b>Blu?</b>

130
00:11:39.177 --> 00:11:42.097
<b>I promised I'll always
look out for you.</b>

131
00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:43.682
<b>Didn't I?</b>

132
00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.252
<b>Have I ever broken a promise?</b>

133
00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:54.715
<b>I'm scared too.</b>

134
00:11:55.174 --> 00:11:59.303
<b>But I wouldn't make you do this if
it wasn't the right thing to do.</b>

135
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.744
<b>What do you say Blu?</b>

136
00:12:09.918 --> 00:12:12.192
<b>That's my big brave boy.</b>

137
00:12:12.421 --> 00:12:15.800
<b>We will be back home
before we even know it.</b>

138
00:12:46.311 --> 00:12:49.607
<b>Your turn Blu. You don't
want to get 'beak-burn'.</b>

139
00:13:03.163 --> 00:13:05.791
<b>Wow, what's going on here?</b>

140
00:13:05.874 --> 00:13:08.627
<b>You arrive in time for
carnival. - Carnival?</b>

141
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.276
<b>Yes, it's the biggest
party in the world.</b>

142
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.675
<b>You know a time to
have fun and dance.</b>

143
00:13:16.135 --> 00:13:17.678
<b>Oh mine!</b>

144
00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:20.181
<b>Is she a performer?</b>

145
00:13:20.765 --> 00:13:23.017
<b>No, in fact she's my dentist.</b>

146
00:13:23.226 --> 00:13:24.790
<b>Dr. Barbosa!</b>

147
00:13:25.728 --> 00:13:28.189
<b>Do not forget to floss, Tulio.</b>

148
00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:30.275
<b>You got it.</b>

149
00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:33.549
<b>Come tomorrow night, everyone
will be dressed like that.</b>

150
00:13:33.654 --> 00:13:35.343
<b>Oh, not me.</b>

151
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:45.060
<b>Oh, wait.</b>

152
00:13:48.086 --> 00:13:51.131
<b>I am not from here.</b>

153
00:13:51.214 --> 00:13:52.997
<b>Hey Nico, he's a tourist.</b>

154
00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:54.603
<b>Funny, you don't look like one.</b>

155
00:13:54.613 --> 00:13:56.198
<b>Really? I don't?</b>

156
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.035
<b>Except, you've got pigeon
dodo on your nose.</b>

157
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.454
<b>Oh, no, this is just SPF3000.</b>

158
00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:03.143
<b>So, are you here for carnival?</b>

159
00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:06.209
<b>Actually I'm just
here to meet a girl.</b>

160
00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:07.794
<b>Huh, a girl? - Yes.</b>

161
00:14:08.003 --> 00:14:10.589
<b>Little word of advice.
You make the first move.</b>

162
00:14:10.672 --> 00:14:13.675
<b>Brazilian women respond to
confidence. - Oh, right.</b>

163
00:14:13.926 --> 00:14:15.719
<b>Yes, it's all about swagger.</b>

164
00:14:15.761 --> 00:14:17.760
<b>You've got to pop
out that chest,</b>

165
00:14:17.865 --> 00:14:19.469
<b>swing that tail,</b>

166
00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:23.253
<b>eyes narrowed look like some
kind of crazy love hawk.</b>

167
00:14:23.686 --> 00:14:26.022
<b>But first we've got to
bust you out. - What?</b>

168
00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:28.983
<b>I'm gonna pop that cage
open like a soda cap.</b>

169
00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:30.673
<b>No, no...</b>

170
00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:32.404
<b>No, that's okay.</b>

171
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.052
<b>You call that popping?</b>

172
00:14:35.323 --> 00:14:36.752
<b>This thing's robust.</b>

173
00:14:36.762 --> 00:14:38.869
<b>No, guys really, I'm
fine. The cage is great.</b>

174
00:14:39.036 --> 00:14:40.037
<b>Love the cage.</b>

175
00:14:40.308 --> 00:14:41.768
<b>Dabbo, suit yourself.</b>

176
00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.999
<b>Don't forget, love hawk.</b>

177
00:14:45.814 --> 00:14:49.109
<b>Yes and to you as well.</b>

178
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.814
<b>This is the heart and
soul of our aviary.</b>

179
00:15:05.981 --> 00:15:07.358
<b>Our treatment room.</b>

180
00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:10.820
<b>They really like you.</b>

181
00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:14.215
<b>A lot. - Yes!</b>

182
00:15:14.219 --> 00:15:16.159
<b>I'm their great big mama bird.</b>

183
00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:26.190
<b>You want some? - No, I'm good.</b>

184
00:15:27.462 --> 00:15:30.257
<b>Many of the birds here were
rescued from smugglers.</b>

185
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.405
<b>Smugglers? - Yes.</b>

186
00:15:32.572 --> 00:15:35.805
<b>Unfortunately, the poor
birds are often hurt.</b>

187
00:15:35.867 --> 00:15:37.369
<b>or even killed in the process.</b>

188
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:40.226
<b>But with proper care,
they can be saved.</b>

189
00:15:40.685 --> 00:15:41.561
<b>Look here.</b>

190
00:15:41.582 --> 00:15:43.563
<b>This poor guy was
found last night.</b>

191
00:15:45.169 --> 00:15:47.630
<b>Hey buddy, you're
looking great today.</b>

192
00:15:47.817 --> 00:15:49.945
<b>Much better, much better.</b>

193
00:15:51.822 --> 00:15:53.282
<b>Get well soon.</b>

194
00:15:55.784 --> 00:15:57.724
<b>So, where is Jewel?</b>

195
00:15:57.745 --> 00:15:59.976
<b>Oh, we have a special
place for Jewel.</b>

196
00:15:59.997 --> 00:16:02.103
<b>She's a very spirited bird.</b>

197
00:16:02.354 --> 00:16:03.855
<b>I'll say.</b>

198
00:16:03.876 --> 00:16:05.399
<b>She did that?</b>

199
00:16:05.586 --> 00:16:06.499
<b>Charming.</b>

200
00:16:06.504 --> 00:16:08.464
<b>Okay, I want to go home now.</b>

201
00:16:08.777 --> 00:16:10.258
<b>No, don't worry.</b>

202
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:12.907
<b>I'm going to make you
look irresistible.</b>

203
00:16:18.454 --> 00:16:21.499
<b>Help! Help! Let
me out of here!</b>

204
00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:27.672
<b>Linda!</b>

205
00:16:27.756 --> 00:16:30.613
<b>Maybe I should... No,
give it a chance.</b>

206
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.167
<b>Hello?</b>

207
00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:45.900
<b>Hello?</b>

208
00:16:48.778 --> 00:16:50.822
<b>I come in peace.</b>

209
00:16:56.078 --> 00:16:57.830
<b>She's beautiful.</b>

210
00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:04.733
<b>What were they talking about?
She's... like an angel.</b>

211
00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:11.469
<b>An angel whose getting
really close up!</b>

212
00:17:16.391 --> 00:17:19.853
<b>You're standing on my throat.
- You're an American.</b>

213
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.459
<b>Thanks.</b>

214
00:17:21.563 --> 00:17:23.649
<b>I need my throat for
talking, so thank you.</b>

215
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.130
<b>You look like me.</b>

216
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.090
<b>Hi.</b>

217
00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.988
<b>Hi. My name is Blu.</b>

218
00:17:29.155 --> 00:17:31.490
<b>You know like the cheese
with the mould on it.</b>

219
00:17:31.532 --> 00:17:33.039
<b>No, it smells really bad.</b>

220
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.126
<b>That's stupid, stupid, stupid.</b>

221
00:17:35.203 --> 00:17:37.559
<b>Alright come on, we
don't have much time.</b>

222
00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.750
<b>Wait, wait! Ouch!</b>

223
00:17:51.908 --> 00:17:53.556
<b>Are you ready? - For what?</b>

224
00:17:53.702 --> 00:17:55.787
<b>Oh, oh, wow. Aah... okay.</b>

225
00:17:56.288 --> 00:17:57.705
<b>Confidence!</b>

226
00:17:58.019 --> 00:17:59.687
<b>Crazy love hawk.</b>

227
00:18:02.398 --> 00:18:03.869
<b>Wow, hey! What are you doing?</b>

228
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.642
<b>What? What you want me to.</b>

229
00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:08.488
<b>But just for argument
sake, what are you doing?</b>

230
00:18:08.738 --> 00:18:10.887
<b>I am trying to escape.</b>

231
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.989
<b>Oh..., ya... escape,</b>

232
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.284
<b>that's where I was going
with that thing I just did.</b>

233
00:18:15.285 --> 00:18:16.476
<b>Wait, wait.</b>

234
00:18:16.518 --> 00:18:18.770
<b>Did you actually think
we were going to kiss?</b>

235
00:18:18.812 --> 00:18:20.522
<b>No, no, no! - We just met!</b>

236
00:18:20.772 --> 00:18:23.921
<b>Oh mine! - I think they
need a little help.</b>

237
00:18:24.046 --> 00:18:26.945
<b>I know how my feathers look,
but I'm not that kind of bird.</b>

238
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:31.763
<b>Okay, I had nothing
to do with that.</b>

239
00:18:32.222 --> 00:18:35.267
<b>But, it's actually a
pretty good song.</b>

240
00:18:36.852 --> 00:18:39.897
<b>'Naturally...' yes,
sing it Lionel.</b>

241
00:18:45.069 --> 00:18:47.373
<b>Wow, That was fast.</b>

242
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.825
<b>Lionel Richie. Works every time.</b>

243
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:54.037
<b>We should probably give
them some privacy.</b>

244
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.297
<b>I'm not so sure I should
leave Blu here alone.</b>

245
00:19:03.318 --> 00:19:04.830
<b>Oh no, don't worry.</b>

246
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.384
<b>Sylvio will keep an eye
on them all night.</b>

247
00:19:11.576 --> 00:19:13.724
<b>Besides, he's got Jewel.</b>

248
00:19:20.648 --> 00:19:22.046
<b>Help me!</b>

249
00:19:26.697 --> 00:19:30.889
<b>This is the final countdown
to Carnival! Let's Samba.</b>

250
00:20:00.378 --> 00:20:03.694
<b>Come here little birdie.</b>

251
00:20:04.091 --> 00:20:07.949
<b>It's okay. I got you.</b>

252
00:20:31.432 --> 00:20:32.850
<b>Excuse me!</b>

253
00:20:33.038 --> 00:20:35.833
<b>Please, I'm trying to sleep.</b>

254
00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:40.129
<b>I'm sorry sleepy head,
I'm trying to escape.</b>

255
00:20:41.589 --> 00:20:44.217
<b>Escape, why? This
cage is awesome.</b>

256
00:20:44.258 --> 00:20:47.637
<b>This cage...? Oh,
what was I thinking?</b>

257
00:20:47.971 --> 00:20:51.099
<b>I wouldn't expect a
pet to understand.</b>

258
00:20:51.349 --> 00:20:53.643
<b>Pet? Did you just
call me a pet?</b>

259
00:20:53.727 --> 00:20:55.771
<b>For the record, I am not a pet.</b>

260
00:20:55.917 --> 00:20:57.147
<b>I am a companion.</b>

261
00:20:57.439 --> 00:20:58.816
<b>And you know what?
Do what you want.</b>

262
00:20:58.817 --> 00:21:00.798
<b>Cause' tomorrow morning
Linda will come for me,</b>

263
00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:02.632
<b>and this whole nightmare
will be over.</b>

264
00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:06.180
<b>Incredibly, you rather
be with a human</b>

265
00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:07.641
<b>than with your own kind.</b>

266
00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:11.746
<b>Well, that human has given me love
and affection for the past 15 years,</b>

267
00:21:11.757 --> 00:21:14.885
<b>whereas my own kind tries to
strangle me after 15 seconds.</b>

268
00:21:14.895 --> 00:21:17.808
<b>Yah, it's because of them,
I've lost everything.</b>

269
00:21:17.913 --> 00:21:19.373
<b>You can't trust them!</b>

270
00:21:19.796 --> 00:21:22.111
<b>Of course, you can trust humans.</b>

271
00:21:23.634 --> 00:21:24.593
<b>Jewel?</b>

272
00:21:24.948 --> 00:21:25.907
<b>Jewel?</b>

273
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.097
<b>Hi there!</b>

274
00:21:38.379 --> 00:21:40.548
<b>It's nice of you to
join me for dinner.</b>

275
00:21:40.694 --> 00:21:42.091
<b>I often eat alone.</b>

276
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:44.886
<b>Because of my work.</b>

277
00:21:45.532 --> 00:21:48.243
<b>I thought I was the
'bird-mad' until I met you.</b>

278
00:21:48.264 --> 00:21:51.372
<b>Yes, right. Do you
have a favorite bird?</b>

279
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:54.729
<b>Well, obviously I'm a
Blue Macaw kind of gal.</b>

280
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.212
<b>That makes sense. They
are very handsome birds.</b>

281
00:21:58.213 --> 00:22:00.694
<b>Actually, it's the
brains I'm attracted to.</b>

282
00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:03.322
<b>I'm not so impressed
by fancy feathers.</b>

283
00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:05.428
<b>I know exactly, what you mean.</b>

284
00:22:05.512 --> 00:22:07.410
<b>My favorite bird is
the spotted owl.</b>

285
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.108
<b>I've always been
mesmerized by those big,</b>

286
00:22:11.109 --> 00:22:13.925
<b>round intelligent eyes.</b>

287
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:18.484
<b>Chicken rolls?</b>

288
00:22:18.485 --> 00:22:19.841
<b>Lambada.</b>

289
00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:22.280
<b>Chicken eyes.</b>

290
00:22:22.802 --> 00:22:23.949
<b>Oh gosh!</b>

291
00:22:34.564 --> 00:22:35.815
<b>Hello.</b>

292
00:22:54.335 --> 00:22:55.711
<b>Oh, Blu.</b>

293
00:22:56.566 --> 00:22:59.611
<b>We should have never left.</b>

294
00:23:00.133 --> 00:23:04.450
<b>This is all my fault.
- No Linda, please.</b>

295
00:23:04.491 --> 00:23:06.431
<b>This is not your fault.</b>

296
00:23:07.828 --> 00:23:11.520
<b>You're right, It's
not my fault.</b>

297
00:23:11.874 --> 00:23:13.324
<b>- It's your fault!
- What?</b>

298
00:23:13.355 --> 00:23:15.315
<b>With your little bird talk,</b>

299
00:23:15.316 --> 00:23:16.776
<b>and that whole...</b>

300
00:23:18.193 --> 00:23:19.434
<b>Well, you know what?</b>

301
00:23:19.435 --> 00:23:21.625
<b>Squawk squawking
is squawk-squawk!</b>

302
00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:24.304
<b>I am sorry. I didn't
mean to curse.</b>

303
00:23:24.346 --> 00:23:26.154
<b>I don't understand!</b>

304
00:23:26.155 --> 00:23:28.329
<b>Sylvio is the best
guard in the business.</b>

305
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.664
<b>So let me get this straight.</b>

306
00:23:29.706 --> 00:23:31.791
<b>You were attacked by
a little white bird.</b>

307
00:23:31.875 --> 00:23:36.254
<b>Yes, with this rag he held
it to my mouth, like this.</b>

308
00:23:44.054 --> 00:23:45.493
<b>We're doomed.</b>

309
00:23:52.793 --> 00:23:56.401
<b>Okay, there's no place like home,
there's no place like home.</b>

310
00:23:56.651 --> 00:23:58.528
<b>How I wish I was back in my cage</b>

311
00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:01.573
<b>with my mirror and my
swing and my little bell.</b>

312
00:24:01.948 --> 00:24:05.181
<b>How I miss my little bell.
- Ssshh, play dead.</b>

313
00:24:06.015 --> 00:24:08.893
<b>What? I don't need to play dead.
I'm about to have a heart attack.</b>

314
00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:11.625
<b>Just do it! - Fine.</b>

315
00:24:17.653 --> 00:24:21.365
<b>Stop twitching. - Come on, its
the twitching that sells it.</b>

316
00:24:25.473 --> 00:24:26.975
<b>Come on in, kid.</b>

317
00:24:34.525 --> 00:24:38.237
<b>Well, what do you know?
Good work, Fernando.</b>

318
00:24:39.009 --> 00:24:42.930
<b>You see boys. What did I
tell you about this one?</b>

319
00:24:43.472 --> 00:24:45.683
<b>That you are going to pay him
half as much as what you said?</b>

320
00:24:45.745 --> 00:24:47.205
<b>No, you idiot.</b>

321
00:24:47.424 --> 00:24:50.229
<b>That he reminds me of
myself when I was that age.</b>

322
00:24:50.438 --> 00:24:54.275
<b>Smart, resourceful.
Here you go, kid.</b>

323
00:24:55.443 --> 00:24:58.071
<b>Hey, it's only half of
what you promised me.</b>

324
00:24:58.185 --> 00:24:59.447
<b>Shut up, kid.</b>

325
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.387
<b>What the...?</b>

326
00:25:02.763 --> 00:25:06.187
<b>I thought I told you I
needed these birds alive.</b>

327
00:25:06.476 --> 00:25:09.562
<b>Tell me, Fernando. Does
this look alive to you?</b>

328
00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:11.085
<b>Huh?</b>

329
00:25:12.732 --> 00:25:14.192
<b>Get it! - Over here!</b>

330
00:25:15.485 --> 00:25:16.695
<b>Jewel!</b>

331
00:25:25.913 --> 00:25:28.900
<b>Hello, pretty bird.</b>

332
00:25:29.423 --> 00:25:30.779
<b>What's the matter?</b>

333
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.239
<b>Cockatoo got your throat?</b>

334
00:25:32.274 --> 00:25:35.205
<b>Nigel, alive.</b>

335
00:25:36.007 --> 00:25:37.675
<b>To be continued.</b>

336
00:25:42.848 --> 00:25:45.684
<b>That was your plan! To
take off and leave me!</b>

337
00:25:45.747 --> 00:25:46.935
<b>Gee, thanks.</b>

338
00:25:46.977 --> 00:25:49.000
<b>Why didn't you follow me?</b>

339
00:25:51.023 --> 00:25:54.339
<b>Nice work, Nigel. - Yah,
nice work, Nigel.</b>

340
00:25:55.173 --> 00:25:57.071
<b>The last two Macawsan birds.</b>

341
00:25:57.989 --> 00:25:59.824
<b>These are worth a fortune.</b>

342
00:25:59.866 --> 00:26:02.723
<b>Hey, Fernando! Hang these
up in the other room.</b>

343
00:26:16.801 --> 00:26:19.762
<b>Hey, birdie. Let me
out! Let me out!</b>

344
00:26:19.867 --> 00:26:20.951
<b>Let me out of here!</b>

345
00:26:20.952 --> 00:26:24.309
<b>Pretty bird. I'm a pretty bird. Pretty
bird. I'm a pretty bird, hahaha!</b>

346
00:26:24.559 --> 00:26:27.114
<b>I was framed. They
got the wrong guy.</b>

347
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.814
<b>Sorry guys. Nothing personal.</b>

348
00:26:40.451 --> 00:26:42.161
<b>So, what is going
to happen to them?</b>

349
00:26:42.203 --> 00:26:45.706
<b>Don't worry. We're going to
find good homes for them.</b>

350
00:26:46.499 --> 00:26:47.729
<b>Now go home to Mama.</b>

351
00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.086
<b>But I don't have
a Mama. Father?</b>

352
00:26:50.169 --> 00:26:52.088
<b>Brother? Gold fish?</b>

353
00:26:52.797 --> 00:26:54.591
<b>Can we keep him, boss?</b>

354
00:26:56.072 --> 00:26:57.052
<b>No!</b>

355
00:26:58.282 --> 00:27:01.139
<b>So Marcel, what's really going
to happen to those birds?</b>

356
00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:03.726
<b>Dulled, plucked, stuffed,
eaten, who cares.</b>

357
00:27:03.809 --> 00:27:06.166
<b>All I know is, we are
going to be rich.</b>

358
00:27:07.563 --> 00:27:09.669
<b>We're gonna to be rich.</b>

359
00:27:57.283 --> 00:27:59.306
<b>Come on, the game's starting.</b>

360
00:27:59.525 --> 00:28:02.726
<b>Yes, you be very clear.
Tomorrow or the deal is off.</b>

361
00:28:03.247 --> 00:28:05.479
<b>Of course, I have
both the Macaws.</b>

362
00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:07.731
<b>Yes, I'll deliver them myself.</b>

363
00:28:07.942 --> 00:28:09.400
<b>Au revoir.</b>

364
00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:13.341
<b>Alright you two, we
load the truck tonight.</b>

365
00:28:13.467 --> 00:28:16.345
<b>First thing in the morning, we
bring those birds to the airport.</b>

366
00:28:17.012 --> 00:28:19.223
<b>You got it? - Yeah,
sure, heard you.</b>

367
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.184
<b>And one of you, feed Nigel.</b>

368
00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:30.964
<b>Rock paper scissors, shoot.</b>

369
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:31.673
<b>Yes!</b>

370
00:28:31.715 --> 00:28:34.457
<b>No-no, scissors cut rock.</b>

371
00:28:34.458 --> 00:28:36.752
<b>Oh man, how come you always win?</b>

372
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.310
<b>Nice birdie.</b>

373
00:28:46.106 --> 00:28:47.565
<b>Here you go.</b>

374
00:28:55.783 --> 00:28:57.326
<b>Ughh, cannibal.</b>

375
00:28:58.702 --> 00:29:01.831
<b>Okay, hold it together.
The key is not to panic.</b>

376
00:29:01.841 --> 00:29:02.899
<b>I'm not panicking.</b>

377
00:29:02.905 --> 00:29:05.022
<b>I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to me.</b>

378
00:29:05.042 --> 00:29:07.920
<b>But it's okay. Any minute
now, Linda will find us.</b>

379
00:29:07.962 --> 00:29:11.409
<b>Oh great, and then she'll just stick
us behind another set of bars, right?</b>

380
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.795
<b>Yes, I mean No!</b>

381
00:29:12.801 --> 00:29:17.034
<b>Look, pet cages might work for you but
I don't want to belong to anyone.</b>

382
00:29:25.126 --> 00:29:28.547
<b>Something seems to be
lodged in my beak.</b>

383
00:29:28.588 --> 00:29:30.653
<b>Would you mind?</b>

384
00:29:44.439 --> 00:29:47.057
<b>Oh, I know I'm not
a pretty birdie.</b>

385
00:29:47.058 --> 00:29:49.934
<b>But I used to be quite a looker.</b>

386
00:29:49.986 --> 00:29:51.467
<b>The star.</b>

387
00:29:53.448 --> 00:29:56.472
<b>Lights, camera, action.</b>

388
00:29:56.514 --> 00:29:58.787
<b>I was striking svelte.</b>

389
00:29:58.808 --> 00:30:01.040
<b>Ambitious feet-to-beak.</b>

390
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.343
<b>So birdie-licious.</b>

391
00:30:02.353 --> 00:30:05.237
<b>Now I'm vile. I'm
villain and vicious.</b>

392
00:30:05.251 --> 00:30:06.981
<b>Oh, and malicious.</b>

393
00:30:06.983 --> 00:30:09.653
<b>I had it all, tv
shows, women too.</b>

394
00:30:09.695 --> 00:30:12.406
<b>I was tall. Over 1'foot 2".</b>

395
00:30:12.427 --> 00:30:14.992
<b>Then they got a pretty
parrot to fill my shoes.</b>

396
00:30:15.013 --> 00:30:17.265
<b>That's why I am so evil,
why I do what I do.</b>

397
00:30:17.307 --> 00:30:20.070
<b>He was a superstar.
So young and vital.</b>

398
00:30:20.091 --> 00:30:22.542
<b>He's nasty. A Southern
American idol.</b>

399
00:30:22.563 --> 00:30:25.128
<b>He's a vicious bird. Who
said that about me?</b>

400
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:27.839
<b>A very vicious bird. I'll
have you rotisseried.</b>

401
00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.920
<b>I am a feathery freak with
beak, a bird murderer.</b>

402
00:30:30.942 --> 00:30:33.637
<b>You think you're better than
me. I've never heard of you.</b>

403
00:30:33.658 --> 00:30:36.244
<b>I'm evil. I'll feed your
cheese balls with weevils.</b>

404
00:30:36.265 --> 00:30:39.435
<b>I poop on people and I
blame it on seagulls.</b>

405
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:40.785
<b>It was him.</b>

406
00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.210
<b>He's a nasty bird,
I'm invincible.</b>

407
00:30:43.293 --> 00:30:44.542
<b>He's ghastly.</b>

408
00:30:44.544 --> 00:30:48.557
<b>I'm invincible, I'm
unwashable, unrinsible.</b>

409
00:30:48.558 --> 00:30:50.999
<b>Like an abandoned school,
I have no principles.</b>

410
00:30:51.001 --> 00:30:53.306
<b>All of you Brazilian birds</b>

411
00:30:53.515 --> 00:30:55.830
<b>All 18 million birds.</b>

412
00:30:55.848 --> 00:30:58.354
<b>I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.</b>

413
00:30:58.355 --> 00:31:01.050
<b>I'm going to make you...</b>

414
00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:03.106
<b>Shut up now, shut up!</b>

415
00:31:04.232 --> 00:31:05.400
<b>Just me.</b>

416
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:11.323
<b>I will make you ugly too.</b>

417
00:31:11.698 --> 00:31:14.097
<b>Hey! - Sweet nightmares.</b>

418
00:31:16.453 --> 00:31:19.915
<b>Not cool man. Scary,
but not cool!</b>

419
00:31:20.458 --> 00:31:22.369
<b>Hey, are you okay? - No.</b>

420
00:31:22.376 --> 00:31:24.670
<b>I'm definitely not okay!</b>

421
00:31:24.712 --> 00:31:27.090
<b>What are you doing?
- Getting out of here.</b>

422
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.920
<b>You going to help me, or what?</b>

423
00:31:28.925 --> 00:31:32.804
<b>Actually our survival guide said to
sit and wait, and help will come.</b>

424
00:31:32.846 --> 00:31:34.300
<b>No one is coming!</b>

425
00:31:34.306 --> 00:31:38.331
<b>We are on our own and if we just
sit here, we're going to die!</b>

426
00:31:39.728 --> 00:31:42.648
<b>Yes, yes, yes.</b>

427
00:31:43.065 --> 00:31:44.108
<b>No!</b>

428
00:31:44.358 --> 00:31:46.402
<b>Nigel, get out of the way!</b>

429
00:31:49.197 --> 00:31:51.991
<b>Stop, stop. Why don't
you just open the door?</b>

430
00:31:52.784 --> 00:31:56.204
<b>Are you kidding me? - Why? It's
just a standard flip slide ball.</b>

431
00:31:57.581 --> 00:31:58.623
<b>What are you doing?</b>

432
00:31:58.707 --> 00:32:00.876
<b>Well I can't... - What?
You can't what?</b>

433
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.425
<b>I can't fly!</b>

434
00:32:08.968 --> 00:32:13.014
<b>You couldn't tell me before now!
It didn't matter before now.</b>

435
00:32:16.642 --> 00:32:18.061
<b>I hate you.</b>

436
00:32:21.064 --> 00:32:22.899
<b>There is something else
I need to know? - Yes!</b>

437
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:25.193
<b>I can't fly, I pick my beak and once
in a while I pee in the bird bath.</b>

438
00:32:25.235 --> 00:32:26.820
<b>Happy?</b>

439
00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:27.654
<b>There, they are!</b>

440
00:32:27.655 --> 00:32:28.822
<b>We got to get out of here!</b>

441
00:32:32.743 --> 00:32:34.114
<b>Wait. Listen to me.</b>

442
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.700
<b>Flying may not be my thing, but
walking is. Follow my lead.</b>

443
00:32:36.706 --> 00:32:38.875
<b>Inside right, outside left.
- Okay, I've got it.</b>

444
00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:41.419
<b>Inside, outside,
inside, outside.</b>

445
00:32:45.507 --> 00:32:46.883
<b>Yes, yes! Come on!</b>

446
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.437
<b>See, I'm bilingual too.</b>

447
00:33:02.858 --> 00:33:04.097
<b>This is great!</b>

448
00:33:04.099 --> 00:33:06.399
<b>I'm chained to the only bird
in the world who can't fly!</b>

449
00:33:06.404 --> 00:33:08.844
<b>Actually, there are 40
species of flightless birds.</b>

450
00:33:08.845 --> 00:33:10.158
<b>Duck! No, Ducks can fly!</b>

451
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.993
<b>No! Duck!</b>

452
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:33.829
<b>Oh yes!</b>

453
00:33:44.258 --> 00:33:45.301
<b>Yes!</b>

454
00:33:45.302 --> 00:33:46.344
<b>Calm down!</b>

455
00:33:49.366 --> 00:33:52.662
<b>Nooo! NOoorrr!</b>

456
00:34:02.881 --> 00:34:05.404
<b>Get out of here, you
putrid poultry.</b>

457
00:34:23.486 --> 00:34:25.321
<b>Oh, what was that? - A stick.</b>

458
00:34:25.613 --> 00:34:28.283
<b>Ahh, and that?
- It's just a rock.</b>

459
00:34:31.766 --> 00:34:34.639
<b>Is that a spider on your
back? - Will you quit it?</b>

460
00:34:34.957 --> 00:34:37.418
<b>It's just a leaf. Turn around.</b>

461
00:34:41.964 --> 00:34:42.923
<b>Leaf.</b>

462
00:34:42.965 --> 00:34:44.154
<b>Told you.</b>

463
00:34:45.218 --> 00:34:47.468
<b>Come on, we need to find a
safe place to spend the night.</b>

464
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:50.056
<b>Safe? Safe! We're
in the jungle!</b>

465
00:34:50.162 --> 00:34:52.079
<b>You know when people say
it's a jungle out there,</b>

466
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.206
<b>I'm sure they don't mean
it as a good thing.</b>

467
00:34:54.238 --> 00:34:58.148
<b>Look, I hate to break it to you but
this is where our kind naturally lives.</b>

468
00:34:58.231 --> 00:35:01.693
<b>Hey, don't talk to me about
nature. I watch Animal Planet.</b>

469
00:35:01.735 --> 00:35:03.779
<b>I know all about the food chain.</b>

470
00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.489
<b>You see, out here I'm
just a hors d'oeuvre.</b>

471
00:35:09.595 --> 00:35:11.784
<b>Nothing more than a
feathery spring roll.</b>

472
00:35:11.808 --> 00:35:14.937
<b>That is why we stay on the
trees and not on the ground.</b>

473
00:35:15.083 --> 00:35:16.418
<b>After you.</b>

474
00:35:17.502 --> 00:35:19.191
<b>Oh no, I don't think so.</b>

475
00:35:19.942 --> 00:35:23.196
<b>I'll feel much more comfortable
in something man-made.</b>

476
00:35:25.406 --> 00:35:26.970
<b>How about up there?</b>

477
00:35:29.744 --> 00:35:33.290
<b>I can't believe I've to drag
your clumsy butt up there.</b>

478
00:35:33.748 --> 00:35:36.293
<b>Drag me? Watch and learn.</b>

479
00:35:39.254 --> 00:35:41.173
<b>Blu! Just wait!</b>

480
00:35:43.279 --> 00:35:45.329
<b>Who's dragging who's
butt now, huh?</b>

481
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.519
<b>Ha, ha very funny.</b>

482
00:35:55.167 --> 00:35:56.752
<b>You see, who needs flying?</b>

483
00:35:56.753 --> 00:35:59.464
<b>Birds, birds need flying.</b>

484
00:35:59.609 --> 00:36:02.720
<b>Flying is... freedom</b>

485
00:36:02.721 --> 00:36:05.582
<b>and not having to
rely on anyone.</b>

486
00:36:06.513 --> 00:36:08.285
<b>Don't you want that?</b>

487
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.892
<b>I don't know. Sounds
a little lonely.</b>

488
00:36:12.728 --> 00:36:14.500
<b>Lets get some sleep.</b>

489
00:36:15.522 --> 00:36:18.067
<b>I'm probably going to be
up for a little while.</b>

490
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:20.567
<b>Because I'm still on
Minnesota's time.</b>

491
00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:22.196
<b>Good night.</b>

492
00:36:23.197 --> 00:36:24.699
<b>Good night Jewel.</b>

493
00:36:28.077 --> 00:36:29.579
<b>Good night Linda.</b>

494
00:36:36.899 --> 00:36:40.340
<b>Excuse me, sir. Have
you seen my bird?</b>

495
00:36:41.112 --> 00:36:43.323
<b>Have you seen my bird?</b>

496
00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:49.600
<b>Excuse me, have
you seen my bird?</b>

497
00:37:24.658 --> 00:37:26.389
<b>Have you seen my bird?</b>

498
00:37:28.287 --> 00:37:30.248
<b>Lady, American lady.</b>

499
00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:32.166
<b>Blu? Blu?</b>

500
00:37:37.213 --> 00:37:40.634
<b>I know where your birds are.
- You found Blu? Are you sure?</b>

501
00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:42.678
<b>It's his.</b>

502
00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:43.856
<b>Let me see that.</b>

503
00:37:50.081 --> 00:37:51.145
<b>You're right.</b>

504
00:37:51.187 --> 00:37:52.918
<b>Okay, where is he?</b>

505
00:37:52.959 --> 00:37:55.212
<b>Come on, lets go.
I'll take you to him.</b>

506
00:37:55.545 --> 00:37:58.611
<b>No, no Linda, wait. We
don't know this boy.</b>

507
00:37:58.674 --> 00:38:00.092
<b>We can't trust him.</b>

508
00:38:03.283 --> 00:38:05.667
<b>I have to trust him.</b>

509
00:38:06.085 --> 00:38:08.066
<b>I don't have a choice.</b>

510
00:38:21.323 --> 00:38:23.930
<b>Do you think I'm an idiot?</b>

511
00:38:25.056 --> 00:38:29.481
<b>There were two birds, chained
together, in a cage.</b>

512
00:38:29.488 --> 00:38:30.958
<b>How could you lose them?</b>

513
00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:33.909
<b>They out smart us boss.
But don't worry.</b>

514
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.548
<b>We'll get them back.
I have a plan.</b>

515
00:38:36.558 --> 00:38:38.612
<b>Oh great. What are
you going to do?</b>

516
00:38:38.633 --> 00:38:42.596
<b>Wonder in the city, calling "Here
birdie-birdie, here birdie!"</b>

517
00:38:42.637 --> 00:38:45.599
<b>Well, anything sounds dumb
when you say it like that.</b>

518
00:38:47.142 --> 00:38:49.812
<b>We have to get birds to
the airport by tonight.</b>

519
00:38:49.895 --> 00:38:52.815
<b>But it's Carnival. All the roads
will be blocked by the parade.</b>

520
00:38:52.857 --> 00:38:56.006
<b>That's why I wanted
to go this morning!</b>

521
00:38:56.152 --> 00:38:57.174
<b>Nigel!</b>

522
00:38:57.779 --> 00:39:01.428
<b>This bird is ten times smarter
than the two of you combined.</b>

523
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:05.224
<b>If he's so smart why don't
you put him in charge?</b>

524
00:39:05.266 --> 00:39:07.330
<b>I am putting him in charge.</b>

525
00:39:08.749 --> 00:39:10.563
<b>Stop suggesting things!</b>

526
00:39:10.897 --> 00:39:12.398
<b>Go find them, Nigel.</b>

527
00:39:21.283 --> 00:39:24.453
<b>Hmm, if we can't get
through the parade,</b>

528
00:39:24.536 --> 00:39:26.413
<b>we'll have to be in the parade.</b>

529
00:39:26.434 --> 00:39:27.393
<b>Huh?</b>

530
00:39:31.252 --> 00:39:34.547
<b>Are you sure it is going
to work? - Positive.</b>

531
00:39:34.797 --> 00:39:36.174
<b>Check my map.</b>

532
00:39:36.883 --> 00:39:39.886
<b>Yes, that's just
comforting. Thank you.</b>

533
00:39:40.053 --> 00:39:42.472
<b>Look, lets just get
this chain broken.</b>

534
00:39:42.473 --> 00:39:44.972
<b>Right, then we can
go find Linda.</b>

535
00:39:44.973 --> 00:39:47.194
<b>No, you can go find Linda.</b>

536
00:39:47.206 --> 00:39:50.397
<b>Once this chain is off, I'm going
back to being free in the jungle.</b>

537
00:39:50.439 --> 00:39:52.149
<b>Deal? - Fine, deal.</b>

538
00:39:59.636 --> 00:40:01.576
<b>Nice try Brainiac.</b>

539
00:40:05.267 --> 00:40:06.995
<b>I think something
is watching us.</b>

540
00:40:12.358 --> 00:40:15.862
<b>Oh, be careful Blu. They
might snuggle you to death.</b>

541
00:40:17.447 --> 00:40:19.032
<b>Oh, come here.</b>

542
00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:39.387
<b>Attack!</b>

543
00:40:42.202 --> 00:40:44.246
<b>What is going on down there?</b>

544
00:40:45.393 --> 00:40:47.208
<b>Go, go, go. Off with you.</b>

545
00:40:47.249 --> 00:40:50.065
<b>Okay guys, guys. I told
you a thousand times.</b>

546
00:40:50.086 --> 00:40:53.423
<b>Manuela Sofia Kamana, listen to
me. Ow! O'yah, right in the eye.</b>

547
00:40:53.527 --> 00:40:55.362
<b>Oh precious, ain't they?</b>

548
00:40:55.466 --> 00:40:58.261
<b>The kids! Seventeen of
them and one on the way.</b>

549
00:40:58.303 --> 00:41:01.515
<b>Hey,... stop shaking them.</b>

550
00:41:03.621 --> 00:41:05.792
<b>They have given me
great feathers.</b>

551
00:41:05.793 --> 00:41:08.296
<b>Oh, this papa needs a break.</b>

552
00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:11.025
<b>So, you two love birds
headed for Carnival?</b>

553
00:41:11.192 --> 00:41:13.840
<b>Wow, love birds? - We're more
like acquaintance birds.</b>

554
00:41:13.851 --> 00:41:16.630
<b>And not even that. We're more
like 'chained-together' birds.</b>

555
00:41:16.635 --> 00:41:18.199
<b>Yes, I mean... Ouch!</b>

556
00:41:18.762 --> 00:41:21.144
<b>What is it with these
kids and the feathers?</b>

557
00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:23.423
<b>We have no idea, we're
having them tested.</b>

558
00:41:23.434 --> 00:41:28.502
<b>So, do you think you could
help us get this thing off?</b>

559
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:34.235
<b>Lucky for you, you know Rafael,
and Rafael knows everyone.</b>

560
00:41:34.279 --> 00:41:35.770
<b>Ow! Again in the eye!</b>

561
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.185
<b>Okay, you want me to
call your mother!</b>

562
00:41:37.186 --> 00:41:38.229
<b>No!</b>

563
00:41:38.241 --> 00:41:40.786
<b>Works every time. They are
scared to death of her.</b>

564
00:41:40.796 --> 00:41:42.392
<b>Call me for what?</b>

565
00:41:42.746 --> 00:41:44.269
<b>Eva, my love.</b>

566
00:41:44.519 --> 00:41:46.643
<b>I must take this young
couple to see Luiz.</b>

567
00:41:46.644 --> 00:41:47.728
<b>Luiz?</b>

568
00:41:47.856 --> 00:41:50.400
<b>You don't fool me for a second.</b>

569
00:41:50.463 --> 00:41:53.508
<b>You and your amigos just want
to sneak off to Carnival.</b>

570
00:41:54.217 --> 00:41:55.770
<b>Oh Carnival.</b>

571
00:41:55.771 --> 00:42:00.098
<b>That magical time when I met the
most beautiful bird in the world.</b>

572
00:42:02.601 --> 00:42:07.178
<b>I still remember the song that was
playing when I first laid eyes on you.</b>

573
00:42:07.397 --> 00:42:11.060
<b>'Tall and tanning,
young and lovely,'</b>

574
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:14.926
<b>'the girl from Ipanema
goes walking.'</b>

575
00:42:14.947 --> 00:42:16.198
<b>Come on baby, sing it.</b>

576
00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:17.555
<b>'And when she passes'</b>

577
00:42:17.556 --> 00:42:21.195
<b>'Each one she passes
goes 'Aah!!!''</b>

578
00:42:23.081 --> 00:42:25.563
<b>Like a river of the
sweetest honey.</b>

579
00:42:26.313 --> 00:42:28.065
<b>I guess love is deaf too.</b>

580
00:42:28.076 --> 00:42:29.087
<b>Come here, mmm.</b>

581
00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:37.054
<b>Okay, take them to
Luiz, but hurry back.</b>

582
00:42:37.096 --> 00:42:38.722
<b>You are an angel.</b>

583
00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:40.891
<b>I'll miss you, my
juicy little mango.</b>

584
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.540
<b>Oh me too. My pouchy papaya.</b>

585
00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:47.941
<b>Hey! Paco, Carlos! Put
your brother down, now!</b>

586
00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:49.942
<b>I can't believe she
actually let me go.</b>

587
00:42:49.943 --> 00:42:52.091
<b>So how far is this Luiz?</b>

588
00:42:52.092 --> 00:42:55.045
<b>Not far, 30 minutes
says the crow flies.</b>

589
00:42:55.636 --> 00:42:57.618
<b>And how long does
the Macaw walks?</b>

590
00:42:57.743 --> 00:42:59.585
<b>Bobo here can't fly.</b>

591
00:42:59.586 --> 00:43:01.463
<b>But he's a bird.
- Not all birds fly.</b>

592
00:43:01.465 --> 00:43:03.577
<b>There are Ostriches...
- You're not an Ostrich.</b>

593
00:43:03.582 --> 00:43:05.068
<b>Well, not technically.
- Wait, wait, wait...</b>

594
00:43:05.079 --> 00:43:07.624
<b>My friends, I want to help you,
but to walk the whole way,</b>

595
00:43:07.625 --> 00:43:09.406
<b>it...it can't be done!
- Where's daddy...?</b>

596
00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:11.924
<b>Daddy, daddy!</b>

597
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.071
<b>But hey, we might as
well give it a shot.</b>

598
00:43:14.072 --> 00:43:15.136
<b>Let's go, quickly.</b>

599
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:17.389
<b>No, don't back.
They sense fear.</b>

600
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:45.398
<b>What an adorable monkey.</b>

601
00:44:02.437 --> 00:44:04.168
<b>Hey, my watch!</b>

602
00:44:30.258 --> 00:44:31.567
<b>Hello boys.</b>

603
00:44:31.577 --> 00:44:34.070
<b>Seems like you had a busy day.</b>

604
00:44:34.116 --> 00:44:35.383
<b>Oh, what? This?</b>

605
00:44:35.384 --> 00:44:38.319
<b>This is just some
stuff we found.</b>

606
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:40.077
<b>Right boys?</b>

607
00:44:40.592 --> 00:44:43.085
<b>I'm not interested in
your nicked knickknacks.</b>

608
00:44:43.251 --> 00:44:45.983
<b>Your burgle-bobbles bore me.</b>

609
00:44:46.006 --> 00:44:48.486
<b>There are two blue
Macaws out there.</b>

610
00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:52.594
<b>And I need your multitude of
vice to help me find them.</b>

611
00:44:52.719 --> 00:44:55.577
<b>Oh yes, what's in it for us?</b>

612
00:44:56.077 --> 00:44:57.892
<b>That's a fair question.</b>

613
00:45:02.584 --> 00:45:04.190
<b>Let's discuss it.</b>

614
00:45:07.193 --> 00:45:09.048
<b>I certainly see your point.</b>

615
00:45:09.049 --> 00:45:11.793
<b>But what could I possibly
do for you in return?</b>

616
00:45:12.136 --> 00:45:13.648
<b>Save me, save me!</b>

617
00:45:13.653 --> 00:45:15.973
<b>Oh, that's a thought.</b>

618
00:45:16.078 --> 00:45:17.433
<b>This is enough?</b>

619
00:45:17.438 --> 00:45:19.655
<b>I don't want to feel
like I'm cheating you.</b>

620
00:45:20.353 --> 00:45:22.491
<b>We'll do it, we'll do
it. Save me, please.</b>

621
00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.275
<b>Save me!</b>

622
00:45:27.485 --> 00:45:30.072
<b>Alright, you twisted
my wing. Deal.</b>

623
00:45:30.833 --> 00:45:33.200
<b>Now then, any more questions?</b>

624
00:45:33.878 --> 00:45:35.473
<b>No? Good!</b>

625
00:45:35.703 --> 00:45:39.519
<b>You'll spread out and find these
Macaws by the end of the day.</b>

626
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.127
<b>Or it's flying lessons
for everyone!</b>

627
00:45:42.128 --> 00:45:43.380
<b>Go!</b>

628
00:45:45.734 --> 00:45:48.142
<b>Go do your monkey business.</b>

629
00:46:03.232 --> 00:46:04.921
<b>I changed my mind.</b>

630
00:46:05.797 --> 00:46:08.185
<b>Maybe we can find a bus
schedule or something.</b>

631
00:46:08.196 --> 00:46:10.396
<b>Come on, you are not
going to back out now?</b>

632
00:46:10.615 --> 00:46:12.575
<b>Not in front of a lady.</b>

633
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.444
<b>Okay, yes..., sure.</b>

634
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:18.269
<b>All right, that's the spirit.</b>

635
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.864
<b>You sure you're up for this?</b>

636
00:46:20.469 --> 00:46:24.237
<b>I mean it's not like we're hurdling
ourselves off the mountain or something.</b>

637
00:46:24.984 --> 00:46:25.860
<b>Right?</b>

638
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:28.259
<b>Actually that was pretty
much my entire plan.</b>

639
00:46:28.301 --> 00:46:28.926
<b>What?</b>

640
00:46:28.937 --> 00:46:31.617
<b>Don't worry Blu.
It's in your DNA.</b>

641
00:46:31.619 --> 00:46:35.079
<b>And if our featherless friends
can do it, how hard can it be?</b>

642
00:46:37.519 --> 00:46:39.166
<b>Help me!</b>

643
00:46:39.625 --> 00:46:40.990
<b>Fun right?</b>

644
00:46:40.991 --> 00:46:42.910
<b>Yeah, fun.</b>

645
00:46:43.337 --> 00:46:45.944
<b>Okay, I need you
two to get closer.</b>

646
00:46:46.758 --> 00:46:48.009
<b>Closer.</b>

647
00:46:49.938 --> 00:46:51.617
<b>Closer.</b>

648
00:46:53.265 --> 00:46:54.599
<b>Nice.</b>

649
00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.320
<b>Now, put your wings
around each other.</b>

650
00:46:56.321 --> 00:46:56.985
<b>What?</b>

651
00:46:56.987 --> 00:47:00.001
<b>Come on amigos, Not that
she's going to bite.</b>

652
00:47:00.105 --> 00:47:02.358
<b>Will you? - We'll see.</b>

653
00:47:02.733 --> 00:47:05.778
<b>Now, you flap your right wing
and you flap your left wing.</b>

654
00:47:05.788 --> 00:47:07.989
<b>And together, you fly.</b>

655
00:47:08.677 --> 00:47:11.659
<b>This doesn't seem
aerodynamically possible.</b>

656
00:47:11.847 --> 00:47:14.370
<b>You think too much.</b>

657
00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:16.414
<b>Flying is not what
you think up here.</b>

658
00:47:16.435 --> 00:47:18.844
<b>It's what you feel in here.</b>

659
00:47:18.849 --> 00:47:20.476
<b>And when you feel the
rhythm of your heart.</b>

660
00:47:20.477 --> 00:47:22.337
<b>It's like samba.</b>

661
00:47:22.546 --> 00:47:24.131
<b>You fly.</b>

662
00:47:28.844 --> 00:47:30.638
<b>See, it's easy.</b>

663
00:47:30.721 --> 00:47:31.780
<b>Easy?</b>

664
00:47:31.785 --> 00:47:35.956
<b>Easy for you to say because from
here, it looks really hard.</b>

665
00:47:36.227 --> 00:47:40.252
<b>Hey, if want to see Linda
again, This is the only way.</b>

666
00:47:40.377 --> 00:47:42.421
<b>Okay, you're right.
- Yes, I am.</b>

667
00:47:42.463 --> 00:47:43.631
<b>This is for Linda. - Right.</b>

668
00:47:43.714 --> 00:47:45.508
<b>Keep it simple.
- Easy breezing.</b>

669
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.885
<b>Trust, lift, drag...
- Come on, let's go!</b>

670
00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:49.596
<b>Wait! Outside, inside,
outside, inside...</b>

671
00:47:50.551 --> 00:47:51.639
<b>Come on Blu, you can do it!</b>

672
00:47:51.806 --> 00:47:53.683
<b>I can do it, I can do it...</b>

673
00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:55.353
<b>I can't do it!</b>

674
00:47:55.977 --> 00:47:57.312
<b>Not again!</b>

675
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:11.077
<b>Am I dead? - No, we
are still alive!</b>

676
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:25.509
<b>This is incredible.</b>

677
00:48:38.272 --> 00:48:40.775
<b>This is the most beautiful
thing I ever seen.</b>

678
00:48:41.609 --> 00:48:44.279
<b>See what you've been
missing? - Yes.</b>

679
00:48:50.744 --> 00:48:53.956
<b>Alright Blu, you're
flying. Sort of.</b>

680
00:48:54.206 --> 00:48:56.333
<b>Not really, but do you feel it?</b>

681
00:48:56.342 --> 00:48:59.928
<b>Yes, I do feel it.</b>

682
00:49:13.039 --> 00:49:14.665
<b>No, no, Blu!</b>

683
00:49:15.979 --> 00:49:17.377
<b>Mi Caramba!</b>

684
00:49:26.365 --> 00:49:28.055
<b>Sorry, sorry, sorry!</b>

685
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.682
<b>We're going to die!</b>

686
00:49:58.191 --> 00:50:02.279
<b>You did not feel it
in here. - You think?</b>

687
00:50:04.489 --> 00:50:06.241
<b>Let's catch a ride to Luiz.</b>

688
00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:11.247
<b>Hurry you two barbos!</b>

689
00:50:12.873 --> 00:50:14.521
<b>What's to the species here?.</b>

690
00:50:15.293 --> 00:50:16.231
<b>Move it!</b>

691
00:50:17.983 --> 00:50:19.505
<b>Come on love birds.</b>

692
00:50:21.528 --> 00:50:22.905
<b>You made it.</b>

693
00:50:23.134 --> 00:50:25.679
<b>I would love to go five minutes
without getting killed.</b>

694
00:50:25.804 --> 00:50:27.055
<b>Is that too much to ask?</b>

695
00:50:27.056 --> 00:50:30.183
<b>For a bird who can't fly, yes.</b>

696
00:50:35.564 --> 00:50:37.900
<b>They're starting to close off
the streets for Carnival.</b>

697
00:50:37.942 --> 00:50:40.800
<b>Better be right kid because
we're running out of time.</b>

698
00:50:53.458 --> 00:50:55.796
<b>Never be able to get my
car through this crowd.</b>

699
00:50:55.836 --> 00:50:57.421
<b>Don't worry, I'm on it.</b>

700
00:51:03.052 --> 00:51:04.779
<b>Hey kid, where did
you get this bike?</b>

701
00:51:04.781 --> 00:51:06.931
<b>I traded it for
your jeep. - What?</b>

702
00:51:06.941 --> 00:51:09.580
<b>Yes, it's in great condition.</b>

703
00:51:10.747 --> 00:51:13.000
<b>Well, good condition.</b>

704
00:51:13.354 --> 00:51:14.856
<b>Hey, out of the way!</b>

705
00:51:15.231 --> 00:51:16.295
<b>Look out!</b>

706
00:51:18.193 --> 00:51:19.403
<b>Hold on!</b>

707
00:51:34.001 --> 00:51:36.786
<b>I'm going to chew through my own
leg if this doesn't come off soon.</b>

708
00:51:36.796 --> 00:51:39.678
<b>Relax, we find Luiz, we're
right where we want to be.</b>

709
00:51:39.685 --> 00:51:43.840
<b>Hey, Ralfie! If it isn't
the king of carnival.</b>

710
00:51:43.845 --> 00:51:46.056
<b>Nico, Pedro! What a family?</b>

711
00:51:46.223 --> 00:51:49.309
<b>Where've you been hiding yourself
bird? I thought you were dead.</b>

712
00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:51.082
<b>Hold up, rewind.</b>

713
00:51:51.896 --> 00:51:53.606
<b>Ain't that the bird
from the cage?</b>

714
00:51:53.616 --> 00:51:56.067
<b>I think our love lesson
when down smooth.</b>

715
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:57.493
<b>You work fast.</b>

716
00:51:57.495 --> 00:51:58.747
<b>Baby got beak.</b>

717
00:51:58.752 --> 00:52:01.150
<b>You're locked up and now you're
rolling with a hot wing.</b>

718
00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.834
<b>I want to be like you.</b>

719
00:52:02.866 --> 00:52:05.431
<b>Don't, it's not what you think.
We're just chained together.</b>

720
00:52:05.441 --> 00:52:08.356
<b>Hey, I'm not judging
you. Keep us spastic.</b>

721
00:52:08.663 --> 00:52:10.832
<b>Hey guys, we're looking for
Luiz. Have you seen him?</b>

722
00:52:10.874 --> 00:52:12.563
<b>Yes, I see him but you didn't.</b>

723
00:52:12.567 --> 00:52:15.567
<b>You just missed him. He took the
trolley back to the garage.</b>

724
00:52:15.692 --> 00:52:16.755
<b>Oh great.</b>

725
00:52:16.797 --> 00:52:19.258
<b>Relax baby bird, you can
catch the next one.</b>

726
00:52:19.425 --> 00:52:21.719
<b>It's time to take it
to the next level.</b>

727
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.075
<b>What's wrong with this level?</b>

728
00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.848
<b>Come on, this ain't the level.
Next level is the level.</b>

729
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.012
<b>You got to shake your
tail feather. - Oh yes.</b>

730
00:52:28.017 --> 00:52:31.167
<b>We got to get this chain off. - Come
on love birds, you are in Rio.</b>

731
00:52:31.168 --> 00:52:33.627
<b>You should enjoy
it. Live a little.</b>

732
00:52:55.442 --> 00:52:56.735
<b>We got them.</b>

733
00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.810
<b>Welcome to paradise.</b>

734
00:53:08.915 --> 00:53:10.156
<b>Some party, huh?</b>

735
00:53:10.166 --> 00:53:12.315
<b>This is the coolest
place I've ever seen.</b>

736
00:53:12.335 --> 00:53:14.609
<b>Despite all the RVS
health code violations.</b>

737
00:53:15.631 --> 00:53:19.134
<b>I like you. Nothing you
say makes any sense.</b>

738
00:53:19.843 --> 00:53:21.345
<b>Alright everyone listen up.</b>

739
00:53:21.428 --> 00:53:24.129
<b>Ralfi has some special
guests from out of town.</b>

740
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:28.311
<b>Lets show them some love because I
don't think they get out very much.</b>

741
00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.524
<b>Everybody put their wings together
and clap them as loud as you can.</b>

742
00:53:32.607 --> 00:53:35.840
<b>Clap them, clap them. I
don't care, slap them.</b>

00:57:22.143 --> 00:57:23.848
<b>Bird man, we threw down!</b>

794
00:57:23.854 --> 00:57:25.063
<b>Yes, we threw down.</b>

795
00:57:25.068 --> 00:57:26.982
<b>You guys were like fire and ice.</b>

796
00:57:26.987 --> 00:57:27.743
<b>Thunder and lightning.</b>

797
00:57:27.754 --> 00:57:28.744
<b>Hip and hop.</b>

798
00:57:28.755 --> 00:57:30.194
<b>Cheese and sprinkles.</b>

799
00:57:31.528 --> 00:57:33.030
<b>It's a Minnesota thing.</b>

800
00:57:33.677 --> 00:57:36.450
<b>You see, nothing you

00:57:49.026 --> 00:57:50.069
<b>What?</b>

803
00:57:52.155 --> 00:57:54.188
<b>But, the birds were here.</b>

804
00:57:54.198 --> 00:57:55.523
<b>Yeah, sure they were, kid.</b>

805
00:57:55.533 --> 00:57:57.896
<b>I swear. The birds
were right here.</b>

806
00:57:57.898 --> 00:57:59.136
<b>How do you know?</b>

807
00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:03.490
<b>Because I'm the one
who took them.</b>

808
00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.123
<b>You? - I didn't want
to hurt anybody.</b>

809
00:58:06.128 --> 00:58:08.120
<b>I just needed the money.</b>

810
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:11.488
<b>Fernando, I trusted
you. - I know but...</b>

811
00:58:13.427 --> 00:58:14.783
<b>Oh man, that's good.</b>

812
00:58:15.867 --> 00:58:17.140
<b>Hey guys.</b>

813
00:58:17.557 --> 00:58:18.881
<b>What are you doing here?</b>

814
00:58:18.891 --> 00:58:22.187
<b>I just wanted to see if
you have any work for me.</b>

815
00:58:22.228 --> 00:58:26.066
<b>Well, if you were here two hours go,
you could have helped us load...</b>

816
00:58:26.233 --> 00:58:28.548
<b>What? Shut up!</b>

817
00:58:29.027 --> 00:58:31.942
<b>So, why are you guys
dressed for Carnival?</b>

818
00:58:31.947 --> 00:58:35.065
<b>No one will know us when we
smuggle these birds...Ouch!</b>

819
00:58:35.075 --> 00:58:36.389
<b>Shut up!</b>

820
00:58:38.558 --> 00:58:39.851
<b>We need a float.</b>

821
00:58:39.872 --> 00:58:40.957
<b>Oh.</b>

822
00:58:41.123 --> 00:58:42.417
<b>A float!</b>

823
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.763
<b>So you guys are going to
the parade. Can I come?</b>

824
00:58:44.773 --> 00:58:47.422
<b>I'm a great dancer.
- Can he come?</b>

825
00:58:47.432 --> 00:58:50.091
<b>Come on, please. Three's
better than two.</b>

826
00:58:50.717 --> 00:58:52.949
<b>Fine. We got to hurry though.</b>

827
00:58:53.115 --> 00:58:54.607
<b>Wow, I almost forgot.</b>

828
00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:58.350
<b>Where did I put it? I
thought it was right here.</b>

829
00:59:00.457 --> 00:59:01.729
<b>There it is!</b>

830
00:59:01.979 --> 00:59:03.147
<b>Got it!</b>

831
00:59:03.481 --> 00:59:04.711
<b>Let's go.</b>

832
00:59:05.337 --> 00:59:06.541
<b>Hurry up, kid.</b>

833
00:59:06.546 --> 00:59:09.737
<b>Can he go on the plane
with us too? - Shut up.</b>

834
00:59:10.926 --> 00:59:13.158
<b>We can't let them
get on the plane.</b>

835
00:59:15.306 --> 00:59:17.913
<b>You can ride a
motorcycle, right?</b>

836
00:59:18.976 --> 00:59:20.582
<b>You insult me.</b>

837
00:59:29.863 --> 00:59:32.699
<b>No, I can't drive a motorcycle.</b>

838
00:59:43.982 --> 00:59:46.631
<b>It's just like
riding a snowmobile.</b>

839
01:00:05.067 --> 01:00:06.694
<b>What happened?</b>

840
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.982
<b>Papa?</b>

841
01:00:07.987 --> 01:00:09.363
<b>What happened?</b>

842
01:00:14.139 --> 01:00:15.474
<b>Don't hurt me.</b>

843
01:00:15.495 --> 01:00:17.393
<b>Stop your chirping
and talk to me!</b>

844
01:00:17.434 --> 01:00:19.124
<b>No, I don't know anything.</b>

845
01:00:19.562 --> 01:00:21.877
<b>When I go biting down your head,</b>

846
01:00:21.878 --> 01:00:24.841
<b>will it go pop or
will it go crack?</b>

847
01:00:25.443 --> 01:00:28.356
<b>Where are the civilian birds?</b>

848
01:00:28.357 --> 01:00:30.344
<b>That means Blu by the way.</b>

849
01:00:30.657 --> 01:00:32.680
<b>They escaped, went to Luiz.</b>

850
01:00:32.805 --> 01:00:34.140
<b>Anything else?</b>

851
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:36.246
<b>They said you were very nice.</b>

852
01:00:36.392 --> 01:00:37.664
<b>Did they?</b>

853
01:00:38.478 --> 01:00:39.729
<b>Liar.</b>

854
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:41.523
<b>And handsome too?</b>

855
01:00:44.422 --> 01:00:47.425
<b>Never send a monkey
to do a bird's job.</b>

856
01:01:09.573 --> 01:01:11.680
<b>Don't worry, I got it.</b>

857
01:01:17.582 --> 01:01:20.231
<b>There he goes. That's my boy.</b>

858
01:01:23.964 --> 01:01:26.143
<b>Is it hot? I think
I'm sweating.</b>

859
01:01:26.174 --> 01:01:28.114
<b>I don't think it was even
biologically possible.</b>

860
01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:30.179
<b>Look - Oh, wow.</b>

861
01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:34.100
<b>Yes, that's your boy, alright.
- Okay, so he needs a little help.</b>

862
01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:35.549
<b>Oh, let's give him some.</b>

863
01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:37.082
<b>Set the mood.</b>

864
01:01:37.395 --> 01:01:41.405
<b>I'm on it. I know how
to set the Mood.</b>

865
01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:42.411
<b>Check it out.</b>

866
01:01:42.421 --> 01:01:45.528
<b>* Get it, get it, get it, get it girl *
* Get-get, get-get, get-get it girl. *</b>

867
01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:48.698
<b>* Take her, take her to the floor *
* Show her, show her how you roll *</b>

868
01:01:48.782 --> 01:01:52.077
<b>* Drop it, drop it, drop it low * * Drop
it low, drop drop it, drop it low *</b>

869
01:01:52.119 --> 01:01:53.454
<b>Wow, wow, wow! What
kind of mood is that?</b>

870
01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:55.331
<b>Pedro, Pedro. A little
too aggressively.</b>

871
01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:58.334
<b>I'm not hating on your creativity,
but I think I've got this one.</b>

872
01:01:58.375 --> 01:01:59.648
<b>Follow my lead.</b>

873
01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:09.069
<b>Now that's more like it.</b>

874
01:02:16.301 --> 01:02:19.127
<b>* Wasn't really thinking,
wasn't looking *</b>

875
01:02:19.128 --> 01:02:22.778
<b>* Wasn't searching
for an answer *</b>

876
01:02:24.134 --> 01:02:27.491
<b>* In the moonlight *</b>

877
01:02:28.118 --> 01:02:32.000
<b>* When I saw you face *</b>

878
01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:37.542
<b>Wow, what a beautiful
sunset. - Yes.</b>

879
01:02:38.794 --> 01:02:40.128
<b>Psst! Blu, down here.</b>

880
01:02:41.213 --> 01:02:44.299
<b>Tell her, you have
beautiful eyes.</b>

881
01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.865
<b>That's good, great idea.</b>

882
01:02:46.844 --> 01:02:48.950
<b>I have beautiful eyes.</b>

883
01:02:50.556 --> 01:02:53.215
<b>Yeah, okay, sure, they are nice.</b>

884
01:02:53.226 --> 01:02:56.203
<b>No! "her eyes," her eyes "!</b>

885
01:02:56.729 --> 01:02:57.710
<b>Your eyes.</b>

886
01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:59.472
<b>Your eyes are great, not mine.</b>

887
01:02:59.482 --> 01:03:03.653
<b>I mean mine are okay but yours, I
bet you can see right through them.</b>

888
01:03:04.926 --> 01:03:05.947
<b>Blu!</b>

889
01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:09.701
<b>Just tell her how you feel.</b>

890
01:03:10.577 --> 01:03:12.058
<b>Jewel. - Yes?</b>

891
01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:15.463
<b>I've been wanting to
tell you, that I...</b>

892
01:03:15.927 --> 01:03:17.417
<b>that I... hoook!</b>

893
01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.338
<b>How sweet, you're
getting choked up.</b>

894
01:03:21.026 --> 01:03:22.444
<b>You're choking!</b>

895
01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.904
<b>Okay! Alright!</b>

896
01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.397
<b>Yap, that's my boy.</b>

897
01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:53.915
<b>Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you Luiz's garage.</b>

898
01:03:58.128 --> 01:03:58.962
<b>After you.</b>

899
01:03:59.004 --> 01:04:00.942
<b>No, no, you first.
- Please, I insist</b>

900
01:04:06.095 --> 01:04:07.597
<b>I guess this is it.</b>

901
01:04:07.722 --> 01:04:10.120
<b>Yes, quite an adventure.</b>

902
01:04:10.287 --> 01:04:12.727
<b>End of the line - Ah, yes.</b>

903
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:15.390
<b>I guess things like these
don't happen in Tiny-sota.</b>

904
01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:16.637
<b>Tiny-sota?</b>

905
01:04:16.648 --> 01:04:19.005
<b>- Oh wait, Minnesota?
- Yes.</b>

906
01:04:19.213 --> 01:04:21.267
<b>That's very good. That's
very funny actually.</b>

907
01:04:21.278 --> 01:04:22.404
<b>Luiz!</b>

908
01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:24.031
<b>Are you here, Luiz?</b>

909
01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:25.313
<b>Hey Buddy.</b>

910
01:04:25.324 --> 01:04:27.576
<b>I got some friends I
want you to meet.</b>

911
01:04:32.665 --> 01:04:34.709
<b>Inside-outside-inside-outside..!</b>

912
01:04:42.801 --> 01:04:45.721
<b>I got you...good.</b>

913
01:04:46.096 --> 01:04:47.138
<b>What?</b>

914
01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:49.212
<b>I could have rip
your throats out.</b>

915
01:04:49.266 --> 01:04:50.476
<b>But I didn't.</b>

916
01:04:52.248 --> 01:04:53.687
<b>But I could have.</b>

917
01:04:53.688 --> 01:04:55.022
<b>Hey Luiz!</b>

918
01:04:55.147 --> 01:04:56.878
<b>Stop scaring my friends.</b>

919
01:04:57.066 --> 01:05:00.799
<b>Hey Ralfi, come here!
Where have you been?</b>

920
01:05:01.717 --> 01:05:02.885
<b>You look good.</b>

921
01:05:02.906 --> 01:05:06.076
<b>Wait, wait. Luiz is a bulldog?</b>

922
01:05:06.295 --> 01:05:08.161
<b>You got something against dogs?</b>

923
01:05:08.182 --> 01:05:10.580
<b>I do when they're
drooling on me.</b>

924
01:05:11.331 --> 01:05:13.500
<b>It's a medical condition.</b>

925
01:05:13.511 --> 01:05:15.043
<b>No, amigo. We really need you.</b>

926
01:05:15.054 --> 01:05:16.555
<b>She's mean brother.</b>

927
01:05:16.566 --> 01:05:19.986
<b>Luiz come on, please.
We need your help.</b>

928
01:05:22.802 --> 01:05:25.346
<b>I think I know what to do.</b>

929
01:05:32.938 --> 01:05:37.588
<b>Are you sure this is safe?
- Sure, there's nothing to it.</b>

930
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:41.060
<b>Now if something goes wrong,
scream really loud.</b>

931
01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:43.324
<b>Because i can't hear too
good with this thing on.</b>

932
01:05:44.054 --> 01:05:46.671
<b>Hey Ralfi! Get the
switch, please!</b>

933
01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:49.142
<b>Don't worry. It's
a professional.</b>

934
01:05:54.815 --> 01:05:59.716
<b>Try not to move. I can't really
see out of this thing either.</b>

935
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:25.097
<b>Hey, where'd you go?</b>

936
01:06:42.387 --> 01:06:43.575
<b>Gross.</b>

937
01:06:44.514 --> 01:06:45.849
<b>But I'm free.</b>

938
01:06:46.266 --> 01:06:48.059
<b>Jewel, we are free!</b>

939
01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.519
<b>Slimey, but free!</b>

940
01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:51.938
<b>Contaminated probably, but free.</b>

941
01:06:51.949 --> 01:06:53.523
<b>Can you believe it, finally.</b>

942
01:06:55.964 --> 01:06:57.277
<b>Over.</b>

943
01:06:57.903 --> 01:06:59.572
<b>Oh yes!</b>

944
01:07:01.198 --> 01:07:02.950
<b>Come on guys, let's go!</b>

945
01:07:03.367 --> 01:07:06.662
<b>What are we standing
around for. It's Carnival!</b>

946
01:07:21.095 --> 01:07:23.034
<b>I know just how you feel.</b>

947
01:07:23.764 --> 01:07:26.507
<b>Watching them up there, makes
you want to chase them,</b>

948
01:07:26.517 --> 01:07:30.438
<b>grab them in your mouth
and bite their heads off.</b>

949
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.902
<b>I'm just kidding, bro.</b>

950
01:07:36.736 --> 01:07:38.363
<b>Chasing them is plenty.</b>

951
01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:52.211
<b>I'm flying, just like a bird.</b>

952
01:07:52.399 --> 01:07:54.151
<b>Jewel, but you are a bird.</b>

953
01:07:58.676 --> 01:08:01.158
<b>Hey, where are you going?</b>

954
01:08:03.244 --> 01:08:04.412
<b>Blu?</b>

955
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:08.249
<b>Blu, What wrong?</b>

956
01:08:08.749 --> 01:08:11.044
<b>Nothing. Everything
is perfect.</b>

957
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:13.734
<b>You be off to the rainforest.
I be back to Linda.</b>

958
01:08:13.739 --> 01:08:15.423
<b>Just like we planned. - I...</b>

959
01:08:15.428 --> 01:08:18.520
<b>Hey birds! Stop yapping
and start flapping.</b>

960
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:19.928
<b>Let's go!</b>

961
01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:23.724
<b>I guess I thought maybe... - What,
that you'll come to Minnesota?</b>

962
01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:25.934
<b>Great, I guess I
make you a scarf.</b>

963
01:08:25.976 --> 01:08:28.604
<b>No, that's not what I meant.</b>

964
01:08:28.646 --> 01:08:31.837
<b>Look Jewel, I can't spend
my life walking around</b>

965
01:08:31.838 --> 01:08:33.609
<b>following you wherever
you're going.</b>

966
01:08:33.615 --> 01:08:35.987
<b>Hey, it's not my
fault you can't fly.</b>

967
01:08:38.156 --> 01:08:39.491
<b>Awkward.</b>

968
01:08:39.574 --> 01:08:40.804
<b>Okay, okay.</b>

969
01:08:40.909 --> 01:08:43.954
<b>You know what? This is
good, just clear the air.</b>

970
01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:46.091
<b>Just be completely
honest with each other.</b>

971
01:08:46.097 --> 01:08:48.829
<b>You want honesty! Fine,
I can be honest.</b>

972
01:08:48.834 --> 01:08:50.054
<b>I don't belong here.</b>

973
01:08:50.064 --> 01:08:53.000
<b>In fact, I never wanted to
come here in the first place.</b>

974
01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:56.279
<b>And...and, you know what?</b>

975
01:08:56.968 --> 01:08:58.636
<b>I hate to Samba!</b>

976
01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.349
<b>Hey, that's a little too far.</b>

977
01:09:03.516 --> 01:09:05.539
<b>Make the mean bird take it back.</b>

978
01:09:05.602 --> 01:09:09.439
<b>Yes, I said it. Every song
sounds exactly the same.</b>

979
01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:13.068
<b>Tiko-tako, yayaya,
Tiko-tako, yayaya. Urghhh.</b>

980
01:09:13.715 --> 01:09:15.633
<b>I'm tiko-tako out of here.</b>

981
01:09:15.717 --> 01:09:18.345
<b>Fine! See you around Pet.</b>

982
01:09:18.355 --> 01:09:19.778
<b>No, no, no, come back!</b>

983
01:09:19.784 --> 01:09:24.163
<b>You belong together! You're
Juliet, Blu is Romeo.</b>

984
01:09:24.184 --> 01:09:28.084
<b>Sure, they both die in the
end but you get my point!</b>

985
01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:32.193
<b>Young love, always
so melodramatic.</b>

986
01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:35.488
<b>Alright boys, go after her.</b>

987
01:09:35.696 --> 01:09:36.609
<b>Blu!</b>

988
01:09:36.614 --> 01:09:38.720
<b>Come back here, come on!</b>

989
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.643
<b>I'm ready for Carnival!</b>

990
01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:45.340
<b>Who wants to ride on my...fruit?</b>

991
01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:47.897
<b>They left without me.</b>

992
01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:49.607
<b>I'm missed out.</b>

993
01:09:55.989 --> 01:09:58.867
<b>Jewel! Jewel! Wait up!</b>

994
01:10:04.456 --> 01:10:07.011
<b>Going somewhere, pretty bird?</b>

995
01:10:07.021 --> 01:10:07.710
<b>Oh yes!</b>

996
01:10:07.835 --> 01:10:10.588
<b>I was on my way to
crawl your eyes out!</b>

997
01:10:10.589 --> 01:10:11.944
<b>Jewel!</b>

998
01:10:13.737 --> 01:10:15.343
<b>Temper, temper.</b>

999
01:10:15.364 --> 01:10:18.888
<b>Now come along my dear, we
are going to the parade.</b>

1000
01:10:19.055 --> 01:10:22.496
<b>Everybody loves the parade.</b>

1001
01:10:23.122 --> 01:10:24.624
<b>Let go of me!</b>

1002
01:10:25.353 --> 01:10:26.959
<b>Hey, get back here!</b>

1003
01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:30.103
<b>Nobody messes with
a friend of Pedro.</b>

1004
01:10:30.109 --> 01:10:33.471
<b>Ain't happening!
It's on! Come on!</b>

1005
01:10:33.477 --> 01:10:35.135
<b>Did you see the
talon on that guy?</b>

1006
01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.136
<b>Talon?</b>

1007
01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:38.638
<b>Maybe it's on, next time.</b>

1008
01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.246
<b>Ralfi, help, help!</b>

1009
01:10:46.668 --> 01:10:49.129
<b>Rafael, quit following me.</b>

1010
01:10:49.254 --> 01:10:52.382
<b>You're going in the wrong direction.
Isn't Carnival that way?</b>

1011
01:10:52.633 --> 01:10:54.426
<b>I'm not going to Carnival.</b>

1012
01:10:54.676 --> 01:10:57.554
<b>No, I'm going home. - But I
thought you loved Carnival.</b>

1013
01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.620
<b>I do, but I love my
family much more.</b>

1014
01:11:00.766 --> 01:11:05.229
<b>And that's a choice I made
with this, and not with this.</b>

1015
01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.253
<b>Blu! Blu! Hey Blu!
I was flying,</b>

1016
01:11:08.254 --> 01:11:11.121
<b>then I saw this big cockatoo
with big ninja talon.</b>

1017
01:11:11.122 --> 01:11:13.175
<b>This cockatoo was ugly.
Anyway to the point.</b>

1018
01:11:13.196 --> 01:11:16.366
<b>Then Jewel was there, and
he snatched Jewel up.</b>

1019
01:11:16.367 --> 01:11:18.744
<b>Then he was like, "You coming
with me you little princess?"</b>

1020
01:11:18.765 --> 01:11:21.914
<b>And Jewel was like, Pssh!, pssh!
"I'm no princess, leave me alone."</b>

1021
01:11:21.935 --> 01:11:23.552
<b>And I was like, "hey!".
Then he was like "what!"</b>

1022
01:11:23.553 --> 01:11:25.324
<b>Stop! Just tell
me what happened.</b>

1023
01:11:25.334 --> 01:11:26.544
<b>He got Jewel.</b>

1024
01:11:26.565 --> 01:11:28.233
<b>And he's taking Jewel
to the parade.</b>

1025
01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:30.673
<b>This is all my fault.</b>

1026
01:11:32.529 --> 01:11:33.864
<b>Let's fly!</b>

1027
01:11:36.075 --> 01:11:38.661
<b>Carnival, here we come!</b>

1028
01:11:40.121 --> 01:11:42.123
<b>Hey dog, I'm flying back here.</b>

1029
01:11:42.144 --> 01:11:44.208
<b>You'll get wet on this flight!</b>

1030
01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.592
<b>Come on, come on, come on.
Where are these guys?</b>

1031
01:11:59.746 --> 01:12:01.873
<b>Yes, nice.</b>

1032
01:12:02.394 --> 01:12:04.167
<b>Very nice.</b>

1033
01:12:04.918 --> 01:12:05.961
<b>Marcel!</b>

1034
01:12:06.566 --> 01:12:07.733
<b>Marcel!</b>

1035
01:12:09.861 --> 01:12:11.425
<b>Oh, boy.</b>

1036
01:12:12.113 --> 01:12:13.636
<b>Bird, chicken.</b>

1037
01:12:15.408 --> 01:12:17.244
<b>Come on Fernando, dance.</b>

1038
01:12:19.788 --> 01:12:20.914
<b>Idiots.</b>

1039
01:12:24.084 --> 01:12:25.315
<b>Excuse me!</b>

1040
01:12:26.483 --> 01:12:27.817
<b>Coming through!</b>

1041
01:12:28.047 --> 01:12:29.194
<b>Watch your feet.</b>

1042
01:12:29.215 --> 01:12:30.716
<b>Oops, sorry.</b>

1043
01:12:31.571 --> 01:12:33.521
<b>Go ahead. Come in.</b>

1044
01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:37.432
<b>Wait, stop please.
Performers only.</b>

1045
01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:07.380
<b>Tulio?</b>

1046
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:10.509
<b>Linda, I was just a...</b>

1047
01:13:20.332 --> 01:13:22.501
<b>I look ridiculous, don't I?</b>

1048
01:13:23.544 --> 01:13:27.243
<b>* Say you, say me *</b>

1049
01:13:29.017 --> 01:13:31.311
<b>* Say it for always *</b>

1050
01:13:33.085 --> 01:13:35.066
<b>* That's the way it should be *</b>

1051
01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.872
<b>Sorry.</b>

1052
01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:42.251
<b>The Parade! It's
about to start.</b>

1053
01:13:42.397 --> 01:13:45.192
<b>Ok, one Witch. Go ahead.</b>

1054
01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:49.238
<b>Okay, just follow my
lead. Act naturally.</b>

1055
01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:05.985
<b>Are you okay?</b>

1056
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:07.152
<b>Come on.</b>

1057
01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:08.675
<b>Blu!</b>

1058
01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:11.762
<b>Blu!</b>

1059
01:14:14.535 --> 01:14:18.227
<b>Wait, no, no, no. I'm
looking for a blue bird.</b>

1060
01:14:18.456 --> 01:14:21.689
<b>Birdo. What birdo?
Move it, move it...</b>

1061
01:14:23.086 --> 01:14:24.671
<b>Wait, what are you doing?</b>

1062
01:14:24.682 --> 01:14:25.568
<b>Tulio!</b>

<b>This is not good.
This is not good.</b>

1066
01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:45.318
<b>This is...</b>

1067
01:14:49.135 --> 01:14:52.555
<b>Cheese and sprinkles.</b>

1068
01:14:56.017 --> 01:14:59.416
<b>Okay, you can put me down now.
I think we are done here.</b>

1069
01:15:08.259 --> 01:15:10.282
<b>I think they like my moves.</b>

1070
01:15:10.553 --> 01:15:12.597
<b>Hey, keep dancing my boy.</b>

1071
01:15:17.686 --> 01:15:20.439
<b>One down and one to go.</b>

1072
01:15:20.564 --> 01:15:22.478
<b>You'll never find him.</b>

1073
01:15:22.483 --> 01:15:23.520
<b>He's already gone.</b>

1074
01:15:23.526 --> 01:15:25.924
<b>Oh, I don't need to find him.</b>

1075
01:15:26.153 --> 01:15:27.989
<b>He'll find you.</b>

1076
01:15:33.578 --> 01:15:35.226
<b>This is the spit!</b>

1077
01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.328
<b>Yeah, baby.</b>

1078
01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:40.460
<b>Now I can get my freak on.</b>

1082
01:15:56.269 --> 01:15:57.708

1107
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:45.051
<b>There they are.
That's the float.</b>

1108
01:17:46.344 --> 01:17:48.785
<b>That float is a crime in itself.</b>

1109
01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:04.385
<b>There he is!</b>

1110
01:18:18.629 --> 01:18:20.443

1135
01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:04.758
<b>You shouldn't have done that.</b>

1136
01:20:04.763 --> 01:20:05.889
<b>Come on.</b>

1137
01:20:14.648 --> 01:20:17.172

01:20:40.509 --> 01:20:43.116
<b>Is that a float?</b>

1143
01:20:43.679 --> 01:20:46.015
<b>Look at the detail
on that thing.</b>

1144
01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:48.288

<b>What are you doing?</b>

1150
01:21:36.538 --> 01:21:39.030
<b>I'm going to pop this

01:22:45.288 --> 01:22:46.352
<b>It's okay.</b>

1162
01:22:46.748 --> 01:22:47.791
<b>It's okay.</b>

1163
01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:50.440
<b>We'll figure this out together.</b>

1164
01:22:50.919 --> 01:22:51.983
<b>Right?</b>

1165
01:22:54.965 --> 01:22:56.488
<b>Let him go!</b>

1166

<b>Jewel!</b>

1167
01:23:00.826 --> 01:23:02.035
<b>My wing.</b>

<b>Oh, pity.</b>

1169
01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:07.437
<b>Now we have two useless,
flightless birds.</b>

1170
01:23:14.215 --> 01:23:16.603
<b>Not cool man, not cool!</b>

1171
01:23:27.354 --> 01:23:28.939
<b>We're going down!</b>

1172

<b>Okay. Rock, paper,

1173
01:23:34.904 --> 01:23:37.156
<b>Hasta la vista, losers!</b>

1174
01:23:37.865 --> 01:23:39.450
<b>Wait for us!</b>

1175
01:23:40.159 --> 01:23:41.974
<b>Cannonball!</b>

<b>No!</b>

1178

<b>Blu, you're crazy!
What are you doing?</b>

1179
01:24:06.562 --> 01:24:08.168
<b>I'm not going to let you go.</b>

1180
01:24:08.189 --> 01:24:10.650
<b>We're chained to each
other birds, remember?</b>

1181
01:24:31.151 --> 01:24:32.110
<b>Wow.</b>

1182
01:24:33.122 --> 01:24:36.177
<b>Blu, you're flying! - Yes!</b>

1183
01:24:36.949 --> 01:24:40.161
