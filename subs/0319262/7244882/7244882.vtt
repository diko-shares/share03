28

is evidence of a cataclysmic
climate shift...

29
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.842

10,000 years ago.

The concentration of these natural

31
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.683

pushed the planet into an ice age...

I thought you were talking
about global warming, not an ice age.

35
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.281
<i>Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming
can trigger a cooling trend.</i>

36
00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:48.408
Let me explain.

37
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:53.288
The northern hemisphere owes its temperate
climate to the North Atlantic current.

38
00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:57.667
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

39
00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:03.465
<i>But global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.</i>

40
00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.467
Eventually,
it will shut down.

41
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.346
And when that occurs,
there goes our warm climate.

42
00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:14.017
Excuse me. When do you think
this could happen, Professor?

43
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.019
- When?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

44
00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.021
Maybe in a hundred years.
Maybe in a thousand.

45
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.815
But what I do know is
that if we do not act soon...

46
00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:24.861
it is our children and our grandchildren
who will have to pay the price.

47
00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.658
And who's going to pay
the price of the Kyoto Accord?

48
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:33.620
It would cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

49
00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:36.247
With all due respect,
M r. Vice President...

50
00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:39.250

could be even higher.

<i>Our climate is fragile.</i>

52
00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:44.965

making sensationalist claims.

57
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.232

I have to go.

490

it's going to be too late.

Jack, were you able
to re-create the thermal cycle?

679
00:52:03.537 --> 00:52:08.792
Yes. The storm's rotation is pulling super-cooled
air down from the upper troposphere.

00:52:11.879 --> 00:52:15.841
<i>But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?</i>

I'm using my body heat

rush back to your heart too quickly...

781
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:24.788
your heart could fail.

I need for you to do first.

789
01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:04.870
You have to explain your results
to the administration.

790
01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.122
- I already tried that.
- I know this time will be different.

805
01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:04.281
The basic rule of storms
is that they continue...

806
01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:07.450
until the imbalance
that created them is corrected.

807
01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:11.246
In this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.

808
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:14.624
The superstorm will
last seven to 10 days.

809
01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:19.796
When it's over, ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.

810
01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:23.466
<i>The ice and snow
will reflect sunlight.</i>

811

will restabilize...

close to that of the last ice age.

813
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.392
What can we do about this?

814
01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:35.854
<font color="#6088d2">[SIGHS]</font>
Head as far south as possible.

815
01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:38.189
That is not amusing,
Professor.

816
01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.775
Where do you suggest
they go?

817
01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:43.778
The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

818
01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:47.991
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't flooded.
Mexico would be best.

819
01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:52.162
<i>Mexico? Maybe you should stick to science
and leave policy to us.</i>

820
01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:55.457
<i>Well, we tried that approach. You didn't
want to hear about the science...</i>

821
01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.710
when it could
have made a difference.

822
01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:02.672
What exactly are you
proposing, Professor?

823
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:13.350
Evacuate everyone
south of that line.

824
01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:21.358
What about the people
in the north?

825
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.112
I'm afraid
it's too late for them.

826
01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:30.950
If they go outside,
the storm will kill them.

827
01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.206
<i>At this point...</i>

828
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:39.417
<i>their best chance
is to stay inside...</i>

831
01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.721
What do you think he'll do?

832
01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.015
I don't know.

833
01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:56.935
Jack, thanks.

834
01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.937
And good luck.

835
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.980
You too.

836
01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.692
We're all gonna need it.

837
01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.781
We can't evacuate
half the country...

838
01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:12.575
because one scientist
thinks the climate is shifting.

839
01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:15.245
<i>Every minute we delay
is costing lives.</i>

840
01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.455
What about the other
half of the country?

841
01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:21.751
If Professor Hall is right, sending troops north
will create more victims.

842
01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:25.046
<i>We need to save the people
we can right now.</i>

843
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.966
<i>We take the same approach
in triage on the battlefield.</i>

844
01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:30.760
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices!

845
01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:33.805
I don't accept that abandoning
half of the country is necessary.

846
01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:36.808
Maybe if you would've listened
to him sooner, it wouldn't be.

847

<i>Bullshit. It's easy for him to suggest this plan.

She could go into septic shock.

That can get bad.

1146

antibiotic immediately...

1148

We're certainly capable
of surviving this one.

1265
01:44:35.853 --> 01:44:39.273
All depends on whether or not we're able
to learn from our mistakes.
