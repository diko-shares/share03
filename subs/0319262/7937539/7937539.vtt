He says there are survivors.

2047
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:28.220
Thank you, Tom.

2048
01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:30.810
That's....

2049
01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:33.650
That's good news.

2050
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:48.120
BECKER: These past few weeks have left

2051
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:48.120
us all with a profound sense of humility...

2052
01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:51.580
...in the face of nature's

2053
01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:51.580
destructive power.

2054
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:55.420
For years, we operated under the belief

2055
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:55.420
that we could continue...

2056
01:51:55.580 --> 01:52:01.260
...consuming our planet's natural

2057
01:51:55.580 --> 01:52:01.260
resources without consequence.

2058
01:52:02.170 --> 01:52:03.970
We were wrong.

2059
01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:07.180
I was wrong.

2060
01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:12.270
The fact that my first address to you

2061
01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:12.270
comes from a consulate on foreign soil...

2062
01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:16.060
...is a testament to our changed reality.

2063
01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.110
Not only Americans...

2064
01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:21.820
...but people all around the globe

2065
01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:21.820
are now guests in the nations...

2066
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:24.780
...we once called The Third World.

2067
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:29.280
In our time of need,

2068
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:29.280
they have taken us in and sheltered us.

2069
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:33.540
And I am deeply grateful

2070
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:33.540
for their hospitality.

2071
01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:59.230
BECKER [ON TV]: We mourn the loss of

2072
01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:59.230
a leader whose order to evacuate....

2073
01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:04.150
Peter? Hey, you feeling okay today?

2074
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.660
BECKER [ON TV]: For days, we've

2075
01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.660
despaired about the fate of the people...

2076
01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.660
...who are trapped in the North.

2077
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:13.330
Today, there is cause for hope.

2078
01:53:14.410 --> 01:53:18.000
Only a few hours ago, I received word

2079
01:53:14.410 --> 01:53:18.000
that a small group of people...

2080
01:53:18.170 --> 01:53:21.460
...survived in New York City

2081
01:53:18.170 --> 01:53:21.460
against all odds...

2082
01:53:21.630 --> 01:53:24.460
...and in the face

2083
01:53:21.630 --> 01:53:24.460
of tremendous adversity.

2084
01:53:24.630 --> 01:53:27.340
I've ordered an immediate

2085
01:53:24.630 --> 01:53:27.340
search-and-rescue mission...

2086
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:31.350
...to bring them home

2087
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:31.350
and to look for more survivors.

2088
01:54:02.210 --> 01:54:03.710
GOMEZ:

2089
01:54:02.210 --> 01:54:03.710
Jack!

2090
01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:07.670
It's good to see you.

2091
01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:07.670
Come on, let's go get onboard.

2092
01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.940
YURI:

2093
01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.940
Look at that.

2094
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:06.780
What?

2095
01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:10.900
Have you ever seen the air so clear?
