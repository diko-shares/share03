Mr. Collins had

1041
01:06:05.399 --> 01:06:08.601
a rather violent
criminal history

1042
01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:11.671
and this was pre-Resurrection
and somehow

1043
01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:14.741
he managed to hide that
from the Cherubim.

never missed anything?

1046

There are plenty of ways to hide
sinful behavior.

there is retro-tech

the Warriors of Enlightenment

1552
01:33:54.301 --> 01:33:56.970
was none other than Father
Stanley Martin,

1553
01:33:57.105 --> 01:33:59.473
wanted in connection for
the murder of an FBI agent

1554
01:33:59.606 --> 01:34:03.243
just hours before he poisoned
a house full of worshippers,

1555
01:34:03.377 --> 01:34:06.613
killing all involved
including his ex-wife.

1556
01:34:06.747 --> 01:34:10.884
His son Nicholas Martin, the
very first Resurrected Person,

1557
01:34:11.019 --> 01:34:13.553
was uninjured in the attack.

1558
01:34:13.687 --> 01:34:15.789
Nicholas Martin has been
sequestered in a location

1559
01:34:15.922 --> 01:34:19.459
inside the Vatican
out of harm's way.

1560
01:34:19.593 --> 01:34:22.696
All requests for interviews
have been denied at this time.

1561
01:34:22.829 --> 01:34:25.099
While Father Martin's crimes
disqualified him

1562
01:34:25.232 --> 01:34:26.600
from being resurrected himself,

1563
01:34:26.733 --> 01:34:28.502
more and more people
are protesting

1564
01:34:28.635 --> 01:34:29.903
against being resurrected
in general.

1565
01:34:30.038 --> 01:34:34.108
We're all sinners,
every last one of us.

1566
01:34:34.241 --> 01:34:36.044
So why are we allowing
the Church

1567
01:34:36.176 --> 01:34:37.377
to take control
of our lives?

1568
01:34:37.511 --> 01:34:38.879
The Church will
do well to remember

1569
01:34:39.013 --> 01:34:40.947
that sins are meant to be
forgiven, not punished.

1570
01:34:41.082 --> 01:34:44.418
Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

1571
01:34:45.519 --> 01:34:47.421
I don't see any stones here.

1572
01:34:47.554 --> 01:34:48.989
The tragedy that
befell us on Easter

1573
01:34:49.123 --> 01:34:51.191
had nothing to do with these
people being Resurrected.

1574
01:34:51.324 --> 01:34:53.127
Not every RP was a part of this.

1575
01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:57.264
This was simply a group of
misguided impressionable souls

1576
01:34:57.397 --> 01:35:00.534
who fell prey to the words
of false prophets.

1577
01:35:00.667 --> 01:35:02.469
There is no reason that these
victims were disqualified

1578
01:35:02.602 --> 01:35:04.871
and were not given
the second chance.

1579
01:35:05.005 --> 01:35:07.674
to live long and healthy lives.

1580
01:35:07.808 --> 01:35:10.677
- Cardinal, Is the Church
willing to accept responsibility

1581
01:35:10.811 --> 01:35:12.412
for what resurrected people do

1582
01:35:12.546 --> 01:35:14.981
with those second chances
you're giving them?

1583
01:35:17.118 --> 01:35:20.154
- The Church has taken
responsibility for sinners

1584
01:35:20.287 --> 01:35:22.056
for thousands of years.

1585
01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:23.924
And we are not about stop now.

1586
01:35:24.058 --> 01:35:27.894
Admittedly, mistakes were made,
perhaps some hubris,

1587
01:35:28.029 --> 01:35:29.930
but these mistakes

1588
01:35:30.064 --> 01:35:33.867
are all part of man's
imperfection, isn't that so?

1589
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.471
We learn from out mistakes
and we strive to do better.

1590
01:35:37.604 --> 01:35:39.506
That is God's will.

1591
01:35:39.639 --> 01:35:41.575
But to deny the miracle
of Resurrection

1592
01:35:41.708 --> 01:35:45.579
simply because some people did
some bad things...

1593
01:35:45.712 --> 01:35:48.315
No, this is not God's will.

1594
01:35:48.448 --> 01:35:49.649
- But even now the Church

1595
01:35:49.783 --> 01:35:52.120
refuses to divulge
the true nature

1596
01:35:52.252 --> 01:35:53.687
of what you call a miracle.

1597
01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:55.689
How can the public trust
something

1598
01:35:55.822 --> 01:35:57.457
when they have no concept of

1599
01:35:57.591 --> 01:35:59.559
how it even works or what it is?

1600
01:35:59.693 --> 01:36:04.898
- Well, that's the point
of a miracle, isn't it?

1601
01:36:05.032 --> 01:36:06.933
You've got to have faith.
