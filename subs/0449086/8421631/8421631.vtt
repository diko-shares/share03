00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:03.571
[grand music]

2
00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.651
[triumphant music]

3
00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:30.831
[ominous music]

4
00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.512
[footsteps tapping]

5
00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:02.330
I am <i>ObersturmfÃ¼hrer</i>
Rolf Kessel from the SS.

6
00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:04.232
And this is one of my men.

7
00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.735
We found him in a ditch
with a kitchen knife
in his back.

8
00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.171
Murdered by one of you.

9
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:14.208
You see
the German army retreating,
and it makes you feel hope.

10
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:16.744
It should not.

11
00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.214
So who is responsible for this?

12
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.384
You, priest.

13
00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.826
-What's your name?
-I'm Father Merrin.

14
00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:35.263
Father Merrin.
These people confess to you?

15
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.931
-Yes.
-So point out the one
who is responsible.

16
00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:39.567
No one here did this,
lieutenant.

17
00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:42.136
They aren't capable of it.

18
00:01:42.303 --> 00:01:45.439
[Kessel] Father, you must
help me with this.

19
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:48.108
-Oh, but how?
-Well, I need someone.

20
00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:49.810
Do you understand?

21
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.481
Surely there is one
among them who beats his wife
or his children.

22
00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:54.982
A thief, perhaps.

23
00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.818
Every town has
someone it can do without.
Point him out.

24
00:01:58.252 --> 00:02:00.254
There is no murderer here.

25
00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:06.327
I have good news for you.

26
00:02:06.494 --> 00:02:09.997
You are all innocent.
Your priest has told me so.

27
00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.601
The murderer is no doubt
lurking in the countryside

28
00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.837
waiting to strike at the next
group of German soldiers.

29
00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:23.177
I am going to shoot 10 of you

30
00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:26.814
in the hope that we can
demonstrate to this wretch

31
00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:30.484
the responsibility
he has incurred.

32
00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:34.755
-A worker's hand.
-Farmer.

33
00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:37.024
-Excellent.
-[man] No!

34
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:39.760
-We will start with you.
-Stop!

35
00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:43.764
You have some objection, Father?

36
00:02:44.632 --> 00:02:46.467
In God's name,
you cannot do this.

37
00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:49.503
You choose.

38
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:51.639
[tense music]

39
00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:53.974
-What?
-Well, they're your flock.

40
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.677
You live among them.
So you choose.

41
00:02:58.846 --> 00:02:59.947
I will not.

42
00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:03.851
You give me 10 of them,
or I will kill them all.

43
00:03:04.352 --> 00:03:05.686
Men, women and children.

44
00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:12.560
-Shoot me.
-You have five seconds.

45
00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.363
-I can't.
-You can't what?

46
00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.598
Pick who will be sacrificed?

47
00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:21.535
History is full of priests
who did little else.

48
00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.737
You begin to irritate me,
Father.

49
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.309
-[gunshot]
-[people exclaiming]

50
00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:29.643
[horse whinnies]

51
00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:32.446
[woman sobbing]

52
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.214
[exhales sharply]

53
00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:37.718
That was for making me wait.

54
00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.254
I still want 10 more names.

55
00:03:41.922 --> 00:03:43.691
What are you doing, Father?
Are you praying?

56
00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:46.527
To God?

57
00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.599
It's all right, Father.
I'll let you pray.

58
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.235
Because I know something.

59
00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:57.004
You see...

60
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.206
[people exclaiming]

61
00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.577
God isn't here today.

62
00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.717
[music continues]

63
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.187
You win.

64
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.294
-Shoot them all.
-No! Wait!

65
00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:31.271
-Joost Harmensz, take him.
-[people exclaiming]

66
00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.075
-Too late, Father.
You had your chance.
-No, please.

67
00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:36.944
Take Joost. And Jon.

68
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.347
-[people murmuring]
-[woman sobbing]

69
00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:42.115
[tense music]

70
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.560
[gunshots]

71
00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:55.162
[people sobbing]

72
00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:56.630
That's good.

73
00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:00.334
And who shall be next?

74
00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:04.171
-[wind whistling]
-[ominous whirring]

75
00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:08.141
[tense music]

76
00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:17.818
[gunshots firing]

77
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:28.629
[man] That's him.

78
00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:30.698
[man 2] He's Dutch, you say?

79
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.834
[man] Half.
His mother was English.

80
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.302
[soldiers shouting]

81
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.638
[man 2] Perhaps he might be
a bit more inclined
to see reason then.

82
00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:39.973
[man] I wouldn't be concerned
about reason, major.

83
00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:41.675
He's a scholar.

84
00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:43.644
We've studied his works
at the Maryknoll Center.

85
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:45.245
[man 2] Oh, yes.

86
00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.181
You Maryknolls.

87
00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:50.684
Cropping up everywhere
these days.

88
00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.522
It's a wonder the Jesuits
don't get after you
for poaching their game.

89
00:05:55.456 --> 00:05:58.025
We all serve in the same cause,
Major Granville.

90
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.760
-He's not one of yours?
-No.

91
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.095
A simple parish priest
from Holland.

92
00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:05.799
When did he develop
this archeological bent?

93
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.368
Right after the war.

94
00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.971
-There was an incident.
-Yes.

95
00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:13.441
Yes, I heard.

96
00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:18.378
And his standing
in the Church now?

97
00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:21.815
Undecided.

98
00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:27.387
The site is right west
of Lake Rudolf,
in the Turkana district.

99
00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.093
It's Early Christian,
which makes for quite a mystery
given its location.

100
00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:38.832
Anyway...

101
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.035
we won't know more about it
until we get inside the thing.

102
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.039
I'd only uncovered
a small portion
of the roof before I got

103
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.375
summoned here.

104
00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:50.478
[Granville]
Did you feel summoned?

105
00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:52.780
I am sorry.

106
00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:55.683
It's a question of status,
you see.

107
00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.620
My status?

108
00:07:00.988 --> 00:07:02.490
[Granville] Officially,
you're still listed
as a displaced person.

109
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:04.625
I wonder...

110
00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:08.562
why didn't you take steps to

111
00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:10.297
clear the matter up?

112
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.734
[Merrin] I've been busy.

113
00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:19.507
Beautiful, aren't they?

114
00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.675
[Merrin] Yes, very.

115
00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:24.177
-Are you a lepidopterist?
-A hobby.

116
00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:26.113
[chuckles] From school days.

117
00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.751
You have been busy.

118
00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:35.322
Six archeological digs
since the war.

119
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.991
This is the longest.

120
00:07:39.493 --> 00:07:41.294
If this is
an official matter then...

121
00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:45.465
-what is he doing here?
-Father Francis?

122
00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:48.769
Well, for one thing,
he's quite an admirer of yours.

123
00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:51.772
I'm about to begin missionary
work in the Turkana district.

124
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:54.107
I thought maybe we could
help each other.

125
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.678
-You know a lot
about the people.
-I'd rather not. Thank you.

126
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.849
This is a little awkward.

127
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.986
Cardinal Jenkins
is somewhat concerned

128
00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:08.421
about an exploration
of this significance

129
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:10.858
conducted by a priest
who is on sabbatical.

130
00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:14.962
-Temporary sabbatical.
-Which comes up
for review shortly.

131
00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:25.038
[Merrin] Perhaps I should
take this up
with the governor's office.

132
00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:27.240
They'd only send you back to me.

133
00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:33.714
Why don't you have a seat,
Merrin.

134
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.187
You sure you won't
have that drink?

135
00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:52.165
The cardinal wants to be sure
that the site's
religious aspects

136
00:08:52.332 --> 00:08:54.001
are given proper
consideration.

137
00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:56.236
Part of Father Francis's job

138
00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:58.806
-will be to see to that.
-Are you an archeologist?

139
00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:01.174
You're not the sole person
with an interest here.

140
00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:06.513
I've contacted your sponsors
at Oxford.

141
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.682
They have no objection.

142
00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:12.352
If you agree as well,
I can renew your visa
immediately.

143
00:09:16.456 --> 00:09:20.560
We all must make
our little deals
with the devil, Merrin.

144
00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:25.332
[percussive music]

145
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.674
[man] Before there were
the mines, traders came
to Derati for the water.

146
00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:35.609
They still do but...

147
00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:39.913
it is a hard life.

148
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.016
-[cow bellowing]
-Ah...

149
00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.153
Why in God's name
are they tormenting that animal?

150
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.388
It is a sacrifice.

151
00:09:49.289 --> 00:09:51.358
The new wife of
the chief elder,

152
00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:54.594
Sebituana, will soon give birth.

153
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:57.364
Sebituana does not yet
have an heir.

154
00:09:57.731 --> 00:09:59.633
So the people make sacrifices

155
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.601
in the hope that the gods
will provide one.

156
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.471
[cow bellowing]

157
00:10:04.638 --> 00:10:06.774
It is a necessary thing.

158
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.843
Cruelty is never necessary,
Chuma.

159
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.312
You think we are savages? Eh?

160
00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:15.482
I--I--I think some of you
are good people

161
00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:17.417
lost in confusion.

162
00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.788
There's nothing confusing
about that ceremony, Father.

163
00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:25.625
They're weakening the bull
so that someone can approach it.

164
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.496
And as for some
of the Turkana being savages,
you may want to be careful.

165
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.299
Sebituana back there
is Chuma's cousin.

166
00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:36.603
[cow bellowing]

167
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:47.580
[tense music]

168
00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:50.684
[indistinct chattering]

169
00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:13.406
Welcome back.

170
00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:21.548
-Did you bring the supplies?
-Um, yes. They're in the back
of the lorry.

171
00:11:21.715 --> 00:11:24.184
Chuma, could you get
Rachel's medical supplies?

172
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.719
Here's a letter for you.

173
00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.155
How was Nairobi?

174
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.926
Hello. Are you the doctor?

175
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:36.563
<i>Habari Kani</i> , Lankester.

176
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.631
It's good to have you back.

177
00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:42.035
Oh, thank you.
Your room is prepared.

178
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.705
We'll need another--
another room, Emekwi.
This is Father Francis.

179
00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:49.009
-You're a friend of Lankester's,
Father?
-Oh, hello. I hope so.

180
00:11:49.576 --> 00:11:51.711
I've actually come to open
a missionary school.

181
00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:55.248
-This is your hotel?
-The finest establishment
in Derati.

182
00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:57.851
Emekwi here, he's a Christian.
Maybe he can help you.

183
00:11:58.018 --> 00:11:59.519
In any way I can.

184
00:11:59.686 --> 00:12:02.555
James, Joseph.
These are my sons, Father.

185
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.426
They shall be your first pupils,
if you will have them.

186
00:12:06.794 --> 00:12:08.561
[Francis] That's excellent,
Emekwi. Thank you.

187
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.533
Well, then, how far are we
from the site?

188
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.240
[tense music]

189
00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:36.756
[gentle music]

190
00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:50.137
[indistinct chattering]

191
00:13:11.224 --> 00:13:12.625
Merrin.

192
00:13:14.928 --> 00:13:16.229
How old do you think it is?

193
00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:20.100
Well, the architecture seems to
date to the fifth century.

194
00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:24.137
The Byzantine Empire had
adopted Christianity by then

195
00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.406
but they never got
this far south.

196
00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:29.843
Wanna have a look?

197
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.546
[Francis] You're--you're sure
it's all right?

198
00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:36.183
Well, so long as
you don't touch anything

199
00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:38.451
and keep an open mind.

200
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:49.196
It must have been an enormous
effort to get these
materials up here.

201
00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:50.697
Up here?

202
00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:54.301
Yes. The stones come from
a quarry near the lake.

203
00:13:55.002 --> 00:13:56.469
Which means a distance of...

204
00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:00.507
[intriguing music]

205
00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:02.042
...miles.

206
00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:07.547
It's impossible.

207
00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:12.886
The stones look almost new.

208
00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.192
With the wind and
sun up here...

209
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.561
Well, they should be
badly weathered.

210
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:28.568
The church must have
been deliberately buried
right after it was built.

211
00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:33.373
What, they came here and built
something only to bury it?

212
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:36.910
I don't know.
Chuma, hire some more men.

213
00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:40.580
Have them work double shifts.
I want these walls cleared.

214
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.018
[speaking Turkana]

215
00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:49.089
[dramatic music]

216
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.044
-[bells ringing]
-[indistinct chattering]

217
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:13.413
[goats bleating]

218
00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.986
[singing in Turkana]

219
00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:22.589
[Francis] I can't understand it.
Who'd reported it?

220
00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:25.892
[Emekwi] Except for this.

221
00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:28.495
-[man continues singing]
-[donkey braying]

222
00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:34.501
I cannot thank you enough
for your generosity, Emekwi.

223
00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:37.270
Oh, please, Father,
the building goes unused.

224
00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:40.873
And besides,
it is nothing more than our
Lord and Savior would expect.

225
00:15:41.208 --> 00:15:43.910
If you need anything,
anything at all, just ask.

226
00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.446
I wish others of our faith
felt that way.

227
00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:50.550
Oh, but, of course,
the town will get
the room back soon, since...

228
00:15:51.484 --> 00:15:54.354
-Since we'll have to build
a proper school.
-Oh, please, Father.

229
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:58.191
Do not think me
a doubting Thomas.

230
00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.793
But...

231
00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:05.965
we may not need
that new school right away.

232
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.868
Hello, Papa.

233
00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:10.837
[Emekwi] Hello, Joseph.

234
00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:14.007
-Hello, Papa.
-[Emekwi] Hello, James.

235
00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:16.876
Well...

236
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.512
it's a beginning.

237
00:16:25.818 --> 00:16:27.487
[tense music]

238
00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:30.090
[man whimpering,
shouting indistinctly]

239
00:16:30.257 --> 00:16:31.324
[Merrin] Call for the doctor.

240
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:33.593
[man continues shouting]

241
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.761
It is the heat.

242
00:16:35.795 --> 00:16:37.530
[mumbling indistinctly]

243
00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:40.433
Pick him up. Let's take him
down. I'll get some water.

244
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.336
-[man continues shouting]
-[speaking Turkana]

245
00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:47.474
[music continues]

246
00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:59.352
[Merrin] Don't let him take it
all at once.

247
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.791
Our friend is back.

248
00:17:05.658 --> 00:17:07.094
[ominous music]

249
00:17:07.294 --> 00:17:09.096
[Chuma] Ah. Cheche.

250
00:17:10.197 --> 00:17:11.798
Come for food and water again.

251
00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:15.968
It must be even worse for him
in this heat.

252
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.705
I'll try to get him
into the tent.

253
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.740
Do not let the men see that--

254
00:17:26.246 --> 00:17:27.514
Don't be afraid.

255
00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.617
[music continues]

256
00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:33.553
[speaking foreign language]

257
00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:45.865
[speaking Turkana]

258
00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:48.468
[tires rumbling]

259
00:18:09.522 --> 00:18:12.592
-[Merrin] You got here quickly.
-[Rachel] Your man
made it sound urgent.

260
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.427
[Merrin] Well, is it?

261
00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:17.297
[Rachel] Chuma, try to
make him comfortable
in the back of my truck.

262
00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:19.199
He needs rest and rehydration.

263
00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:21.668
[speaking Turkana]

264
00:18:25.972 --> 00:18:27.174
Heat stroke.

265
00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:31.444
-You're working them too hard.
-There's water in the tent
if you'd like.

266
00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:33.380
I would. Thank you.

267
00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.317
[Merrin] We had another visit
from that boy today.

268
00:18:37.484 --> 00:18:38.985
-[Rachel] Cheche?
-Yes.

269
00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.454
-Any luck?
-[scoffs]

270
00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.223
Couldn't even get close.

271
00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:51.331
I had to sedate him
two weeks ago.

272
00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:54.867
Just to treat a beating
he took from a villager.

273
00:18:57.437 --> 00:18:58.805
Why don't they help him?

274
00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:01.941
They think he's cursed.

275
00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.844
What he needs is
sustained treatment.

276
00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:13.286
Yes?

277
00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:15.222
Nothing.

278
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.572

-[hyenas whining, growling]

283
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.848
Early this year.

284
00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:51.518
Two of the cattle
have been killed already.

285
00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.354
Thank you, Chuma.

286
00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.457
I must keep you safe
for the lady doctor.

287
00:21:04.697 --> 00:21:07.300
[gentle music playing]

288
00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:22.281

00:22:10.363 --> 00:22:11.364
Cheche.

[Cheche whimpering,

[knocking on door]

302
00:22:42.729 --> 00:22:44.697
[Rachel]
The sores were very infected.

303
00:22:46.499 --> 00:22:49.469
I've cleaned and dressed them.
There's no permanent damage.

304
00:22:52.338 --> 00:22:54.474
The leg and arm
are a different matter.

305
00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:58.077
Night, Mara.
[speaking Turkana]

306
00:23:03.015 --> 00:23:04.183
There's nothing you can do?

307
00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:07.520
Not for the arm.

308
00:23:09.522 --> 00:23:10.957
The leg...

309
00:23:11.157 --> 00:23:13.860
The leg could be theoretical--
Theoret--

310
00:23:14.927 --> 00:23:17.464
-Theoret...
-"Theoretically."

311
00:23:17.797 --> 00:23:20.833
Theoretically, the leg
could be re-broken

312
00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:24.103
and set properly by a surgeon
from Nairobi.

313
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.371
They fly from...

314
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:29.876
Do you think he'd allow it?

315
00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:35.047
[gentle music playing]

316
00:23:43.556 --> 00:23:45.024
It was called Chelmno.

317
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.963
That was the Polish name.
The Germans called it Kulmhof.

318
00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:57.203
I was in a processing center
for confiscated items.

319
00:23:59.872 --> 00:24:04.644
It's amazing what you're
capable of when your
physical survival is at stake.

320
00:24:04.811 --> 00:24:07.313
Things you think
you could never endure.

321
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:12.384
Well, nobody knew back then.
Everybody, we heard stories--

322
00:24:12.552 --> 00:24:13.953
[electricity buzzing]

323
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.089
[sighs] I wish they could fix
that generator.

324
00:24:18.991 --> 00:24:20.359
No one wanted to believe.

325
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:23.395
Of course not.

326
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.332
Who could believe such things
were happening?

327
00:24:26.833 --> 00:24:28.334
No one wanted to believe.

328
00:24:29.802 --> 00:24:32.404
It's so much easier
to believe evil is random

329
00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:34.440
or an ogre,

330
00:24:35.608 --> 00:24:39.579
not that it's a human condition,
something everyone
is capable of.

331
00:24:42.515 --> 00:24:45.985
I believed God let us decide
between good and evil.

332
00:24:48.454 --> 00:24:49.589
I chose good.

333
00:24:50.823 --> 00:24:51.991
Evil happened.

334
00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.329
[electricity buzzing]

335
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:03.302
Now you travel.

336
00:25:05.304 --> 00:25:06.606
What are you looking for?

337
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:09.842
Nothing.

338
00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:16.182
Sometimes I think the best view
of God is from hell.

339
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:19.786
This boy here...

340
00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:22.221
[tense music]

341
00:25:23.923 --> 00:25:26.058
You brought something
out of that young man.

342
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.496
God is in that boy that
doesn't speak.

343
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:33.733
Until he tried to speak to you.

344
00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:36.002
He's an unfortunate.

345
00:25:37.837 --> 00:25:39.071
One of God's afflicted.

346
00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:43.976
I think what you're looking for,
Father Merrin,

347
00:25:45.778 --> 00:25:46.979
is here.

348
00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:51.918
[thunder rumbling]

349
00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:54.186

00:26:12.038 --> 00:26:14.406

[baby crying]

[wind whooshing]

[woman singing indistinctly]

[child whimpering]

357

[roaring]

358

[screaming in distance]

359

[growling]

360
00:26:53.913 --> 00:26:57.416
[tense music]

00:26:59.218 --> 00:27:01.387
[shovels scraping]

362
00:27:07.093 --> 00:27:10.562
[gentle music]

-[indistinct chattering]

364
00:27:18.004 --> 00:27:21.507
[grand music]

365
00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.636
[tense music]

366
00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.352
You have been very brave,
Cheche.

367
00:28:08.487 --> 00:28:09.688
You're on the mend.

368
00:28:11.924 --> 00:28:12.925
There.

369
00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:16.195
Better, eh?

370
00:28:18.497 --> 00:28:19.799
[speaking Turkana]

371
00:28:21.868 --> 00:28:23.202
Be...

372
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:24.904
Better.

373
00:28:25.304 --> 00:28:26.672
Yes. Better.

374
00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:35.081
Merrin was right about you,
Cheche.

375
00:28:35.714 --> 00:28:37.183
I thought you'd run away.

376
00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:41.187
Cheche,

377
00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:43.655
if <i>App</i> and I...

378
00:28:44.523 --> 00:28:46.258
If we could make your
leg better...

379
00:28:46.692 --> 00:28:47.994
[speaking Turkana]

380
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.161
Better.

381
00:28:50.763 --> 00:28:52.031
Would you want that?

382
00:28:55.034 --> 00:28:56.035
Well.

383
00:28:57.369 --> 00:28:59.872
We'll have a great deal of news
for <i>Appa</i> , won't we?

384
00:29:01.207 --> 00:29:02.775
Merrin, it's magnificent.

385
00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:08.180
[Merrin]
Wait till you get inside.

386
00:29:13.019 --> 00:29:15.087
[doors creaking]

387
00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:21.293
[tense music]

388
00:29:43.816 --> 00:29:45.384
[Francis] The war in heaven.

389
00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:47.586
St. Michael.

390
00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:52.992
It's so strange.

391
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:56.695
Churches were built
to honor God,

392
00:29:57.263 --> 00:29:59.331
provide a house of worship,
but this...

393
00:30:01.267 --> 00:30:03.202
This can't have been
a meeting place.

394
00:30:05.137 --> 00:30:06.272
No.

395
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.009
This had to have
another purpose.

396
00:30:12.778 --> 00:30:13.880
Merrin.

397
00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:15.614
Look at the figures.

398
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:20.786
Yes.

399
00:30:21.954 --> 00:30:24.156
Church architecture is supposed
to reach for the heavens.

400
00:30:24.323 --> 00:30:26.926
-But this looks as if--
-As if it were holding
something down.

401
00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:31.163
These rocks.

402
00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:34.466
These rocks are like plugs.

403
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:40.372
What is that?

404
00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:42.841
[tense music]

405
00:30:43.309 --> 00:30:44.944
Like a sarcophagus.

406
00:31:05.164 --> 00:31:06.665
-[rattling]
-[canteen clattering]

407
00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:09.035
[tense music]

408
00:31:20.746 --> 00:31:21.747
Shh.

409
00:31:23.082 --> 00:31:24.083
[whispering] What?

410
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.318
[water dripping]

411
00:31:42.134 --> 00:31:43.535
-You hear that?
-Yes.

412
00:31:43.702 --> 00:31:45.671
[music continues]

413
00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:57.516
Chuma.

414
00:31:58.217 --> 00:31:59.885
Bring me some men
and the shear legs.

415
00:32:04.723 --> 00:32:06.558
[man speaking Turkana]

416
00:32:06.725 --> 00:32:08.660
[ominous music]

417
00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:13.765
What is it?

418
00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:16.602
What are you frightened of?

419
00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:28.947
[tense music]

420
00:33:22.134 --> 00:33:23.669
It's a temple of some kind.

421
00:33:28.207 --> 00:33:30.309
What idol could inspire
a place like this?

422
00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:41.553
I'd say it's dedicated to him.

423
00:33:47.093 --> 00:33:49.328
Some pagan god of these parts.

424
00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:51.497
Chuma?

425
00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:53.865
The old people would sometimes
tell stories

426
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:56.335
of mountain demons
to scare us, but...

427
00:33:57.403 --> 00:33:59.505
They built the church
on top of this.

428
00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:03.409
That's why they buried it.
To hold this down.

429
00:34:05.077 --> 00:34:06.645
They used St. Michael
to emphasize

430
00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:09.148
that the old gods
had no power before the one.

431
00:34:11.683 --> 00:34:13.185
But I never believed.

432
00:34:14.153 --> 00:34:16.388
[music continues]

433
00:34:18.757 --> 00:34:20.192
These are bloodstains.

434
00:34:25.197 --> 00:34:27.833
-People were sacrificed here.
-Yeah.

435
00:34:28.234 --> 00:34:30.502
It's almost like a scene out of
the Inquisition, isn't it?

436
00:34:36.208 --> 00:34:38.877
[tense music]

437
00:34:58.564 --> 00:35:01.300
[cattle lowing]

438
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:07.573
The hyenas must have
attacked the cattle.

439
00:35:09.275 --> 00:35:10.509
But the cattle...

440
00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.411
killed them.

441
00:35:14.246 --> 00:35:15.747
Then ate them.

442
00:35:17.149 --> 00:35:18.617
And now they die of it.

443
00:35:18.784 --> 00:35:20.319
[flies buzzing]

444
00:35:20.486 --> 00:35:23.689
[speaking Turkana]

445
00:35:29.528 --> 00:35:30.962
He wants you to stop digging.

446
00:35:32.798 --> 00:35:34.166
He thinks the church is evil.

447
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.803
[speaking Turkana]

448
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.872
[speaking Turkana]

449
00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:44.643
[exclaims]

450
00:35:47.513 --> 00:35:48.647
His side of the family,

451
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.549
either old ways or nothing.

452
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.451
No argument.

453
00:35:52.818 --> 00:35:54.320
[flies buzzing]

454
00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.821
[grunts]

455
00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.889
[tense music]

456
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.464
[cow grunting]

457
00:36:09.668 --> 00:36:10.869
[Merrin] Look here.

458
00:36:11.036 --> 00:36:12.704
Look, look how it was done.

459
00:36:13.972 --> 00:36:18.109
The workers who did this
were not just--not just workers.
They were artists.

460
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.079
The mosaics came
from across the world.

461
00:36:21.547 --> 00:36:24.049
Here. The great battle
of the angels.

462
00:36:24.216 --> 00:36:25.784
[grand music]

463
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:28.987
The turquoise from Egypt,
malachite from Namibia,

464
00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:31.323
lapis from Afghanistan.

465
00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:34.493
[Rachel] Extraordinary.

466
00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:38.897
[Merrin] This is St. Michael.
It's his church.
It's dedicated to him.

467
00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:43.201
-[Rachel] But the violence...
-It's the war of heaven.

468
00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:45.837
God's angels fighting Satan
and his legion...

469
00:36:47.573 --> 00:36:49.441
cast into the underworld.

470
00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:53.345
[Rachel] It's the sort of find
that makes a career.

471
00:36:53.512 --> 00:36:56.882
[Merrin chuckles] I thought that
at first, but now it seems...

472
00:36:58.517 --> 00:36:59.751
There is he.

473
00:37:00.352 --> 00:37:03.021
Lucifer, source of light.

474
00:37:03.555 --> 00:37:05.757
He was called
the most perfect of angels.

475
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.930
It will make you, Lankester.

476
00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:14.866
But what will it make you?

477
00:37:16.535 --> 00:37:18.103
You're trying to see through me.

478
00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.873
Are you a head doctor as well?

479
00:37:22.508 --> 00:37:24.943
It doesn't take an expert
to see you're suffering.

480
00:37:25.644 --> 00:37:26.945
You're in guilt.

481
00:37:28.013 --> 00:37:29.281
[Merrin] We're all in guilt.

482
00:37:31.317 --> 00:37:32.751
[Rachel] What I told you
the other night,

483
00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:35.454
I never told anyone else.

484
00:37:36.622 --> 00:37:39.391
I told you because of something
I saw in you.

485
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.398
[indistinct chattering]

486
00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:52.571
Merrin.

487
00:37:55.607 --> 00:37:57.943
I've got to inform
Cardinal Jenkins.

488
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.149
I hope you understand
that if word gets out
about what's in there

489
00:38:04.316 --> 00:38:07.085
-the danger of violation
and looting--
-Which is why we have

490
00:38:07.252 --> 00:38:09.054
to inform
Major Granville as well.

491
00:38:09.588 --> 00:38:11.557
Ask him to send
a detachment of guards.

492
00:38:11.723 --> 00:38:12.758
Oh.

493
00:38:12.924 --> 00:38:15.327
Because the British
have proved so trustworthy.

494
00:38:16.094 --> 00:38:17.796
I suppose you haven't seen
the British Museum.

495
00:38:17.963 --> 00:38:19.965
Everything in it was looted
from sites like that.

496
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.600
Merrin, please.

497
00:38:23.502 --> 00:38:24.936
You're not
the only one involved.

498
00:38:25.671 --> 00:38:28.139
-[tense music]
-[camel lowing]

499
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:47.258
Get on, boys.

500
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.196
[Sergeant Major]
All right, come on! Come on!
Come on! Out, out, out!

501
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.999
Welcome, major.
Welcome to Derati.

502
00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:57.469
Fall in on the left,
promptly on the right.

503
00:38:57.636 --> 00:39:00.872
Fall in and stand easy!

504
00:39:02.508 --> 00:39:03.809
[Granville] Good morning.

505
00:39:04.543 --> 00:39:05.711
Good morning.

506
00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:09.848
-Beloved wherever we go.
-Sir.

507
00:39:10.949 --> 00:39:12.884
Sergeant major,
have the men stand to attention.

508
00:39:13.552 --> 00:39:16.488
I have a feeling
those good women
report to the local aristocracy.

509
00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:20.358
And I don't want to display
even a hint of disrespect

510
00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:23.595
-now or at any other time.
Am I clear?
-Yes, sir.

511
00:39:24.129 --> 00:39:27.165
Respect for the godforsaken
fuzzies at all times, sir.

512
00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:29.501
Sergeant major, that is
precisely the sort of comment--

513
00:39:29.668 --> 00:39:31.069
Squad!

514
00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:32.838
Squad, attention!

515
00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:36.842
-Men standing to attention, sir.
-Thank you.

516
00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:47.553
[Rachel] Mix it with blood
or water. It's for pain.

517
00:39:48.654 --> 00:39:49.855
[speaking Turkana]

518
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.229
Sebituana's wife
has gone into labor.
She's in a great deal of pain.

519
00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:00.699
-This is Dr. Lamu.
-Oh, doctor.

520
00:40:00.866 --> 00:40:02.934
-Joseph Lamu.
-Rachel Lesno.

521
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:05.604
-So good of you to come.
-Not a problem.

522
00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:07.906
I told them to bring her here,
but...

523
00:40:08.674 --> 00:40:10.141
So I've sent some morphine.

524
00:40:19.618 --> 00:40:20.852
[soldier] What, do you think
they count them?

525
00:40:21.419 --> 00:40:23.455
-[soldier 2] Hm?
-Do you think they count them
every night?

526
00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:27.559
-Might do.
-Might do.

527
00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:29.928
You got no more sense
than the fuzzies, corporal.

528
00:40:30.729 --> 00:40:31.730
Here.

529
00:40:32.397 --> 00:40:34.065
Respect the stripes, boy.

530
00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:36.468
Oh, "respect the stripes" now,
is it?

531
00:40:37.402 --> 00:40:39.270
I tell you, they got thousands
of the things.

532
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:42.608
Just a handful would make us
rich for the rest of our lives.

533
00:40:43.074 --> 00:40:44.543
-Or get us hung.
-Yeah?

534
00:40:46.144 --> 00:40:47.979
Well, they can't hang us for
having a look, now, can they?

535
00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:00.759
[doors opening]

536
00:41:07.633 --> 00:41:10.101
-[playing drums]
-[people singing in Turkana]

537
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:15.574
[woman groaning]

538
00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:29.855
[Merrin]
His wounds are healing well.

539
00:41:30.021 --> 00:41:31.757
[Rachel] I hope we do as well
with this.

540
00:41:32.057 --> 00:41:33.124
[Lamu] He's young.

541
00:41:34.693 --> 00:41:36.027
His bones are strong.

542
00:41:36.194 --> 00:41:38.096
-[panting]
-[dinging, drumming continue]

543
00:41:38.263 --> 00:41:40.866
[moaning]

544
00:41:46.672 --> 00:41:48.707
[speaking Turkana]

545
00:41:48.874 --> 00:41:52.010
[woman moaning]

546
00:41:53.111 --> 00:41:55.881
-[drumming, singing continue]
-[tense music]

547
00:42:04.656 --> 00:42:06.057
[soldier] Jesus Christ!

548
00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:08.159
Hundreds of them.

549
00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:10.862
Every kind of precious stone.

550
00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:15.133
Just a handful is all I need.

551
00:42:15.934 --> 00:42:17.168
[scoffs]

552
00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:19.004
All we need, private.

553
00:42:20.005 --> 00:42:21.907
We pool the take. Yeah?

554
00:42:22.674 --> 00:42:23.675
Yeah.

555
00:42:32.017 --> 00:42:35.654
[drumming, singing
continue faster]

556
00:42:44.696 --> 00:42:48.499
[screams]

557
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:54.405
[speaking Turkana]

558
00:42:58.076 --> 00:43:00.979
[wind whistling]

559
00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:04.082
[ominous whirring]

560
00:43:07.252 --> 00:43:08.820
[dog barking]

561
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.505
[tense music]

562
00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:57.302
Cover them.

563
00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.507
Sorry, sir?

564
00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:04.275
[Granville]
They're British soldiers.

565
00:44:05.744 --> 00:44:07.545
I won't have them
left like that.

566
00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:11.449
Of course, sir.

567
00:44:12.851 --> 00:44:14.319
Richardson. Avery.

568
00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.788
Get some blankets
and cover those soldiers.

569
00:44:41.212 --> 00:44:43.348
You will keep me informed
about Cheche?

570
00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:44.783
Yes, of course.

571
00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:49.420
Merrin.

572
00:44:51.122 --> 00:44:52.223
Merrin.

573
00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:56.361
-What's going on here?
-What do you mean?

574
00:44:57.763 --> 00:44:59.330
What's going on here?

575
00:44:59.831 --> 00:45:01.032
This whole valley.

576
00:45:08.907 --> 00:45:10.541
Why don't you stay
a couple of days.

577
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.980
You hardly had any rest.
I'll show you the dig,
the church we found.

578
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:17.348
Who's in charge here?

579
00:45:18.316 --> 00:45:20.418
Military. Major Granville.

580
00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:23.855
-Not you?
-[chuckling] No.

581
00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:26.191
No, not me.

582
00:45:28.426 --> 00:45:29.895
[tense music]

583
00:45:36.334 --> 00:45:39.037
You take care of yourself,
Lankester Merrin.

584
00:45:42.273 --> 00:45:43.741
Yes.

585
00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:45.543
Thank you.

586
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:48.814
[music continues]

587
00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:30.956
Who, Merrin?

588
00:46:32.323 --> 00:46:33.558
Why?

589
00:46:34.292 --> 00:46:35.827
Well, these were on the ground.

590
00:46:36.895 --> 00:46:38.897
They'd been pried out
of the mosaics.

591
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.635
Maybe they were trying
to stop a robbery.

592
00:46:46.004 --> 00:46:48.306
-Got killed by the thieves.
-Of course.

593
00:46:51.442 --> 00:46:53.278
-Bloody savages.
-No.

594
00:46:53.444 --> 00:46:55.813
There's no reason to suspect
the Turkana, major.

595
00:46:56.281 --> 00:46:58.683
-What?
-The style of the killings,

596
00:47:00.318 --> 00:47:01.987
the positioning of the bodies.

597
00:47:02.453 --> 00:47:03.521
He's right.

598
00:47:04.289 --> 00:47:06.791
It's--it's Christian imagery,
not pagan.

599
00:47:07.292 --> 00:47:08.826
John the Baptist,
head on a platter.

600
00:47:08.994 --> 00:47:11.496
-Peter the Apostle crucified--
-Are you saying a Christian
is responsible?

601
00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.131
You're both insane.

602
00:47:14.132 --> 00:47:15.333
Merrin.

603
00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:18.636
Chuma, get that man out of here.

604
00:47:19.304 --> 00:47:20.838
Jomo saw what happened, major.

605
00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.474
Did he?

606
00:47:30.015 --> 00:47:33.518
And what was it
this Jomo saw precisely?

607
00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:37.022
Jomo watches from the hills that
lie above this place, and...

608
00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:39.457
-And?
-He says...

609
00:47:41.993 --> 00:47:44.062
He says he saw
the two soldiers argue.

610
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:47.198
One killed the other
and then stabbed himself.

611
00:47:47.999 --> 00:47:49.200
What the devil are you saying?

612
00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:50.468
[speaking Turkana]

613
00:47:50.868 --> 00:47:52.070
They were stealing jewels.

614
00:47:52.737 --> 00:47:54.239
And then some sort of madness
overtook them--

615
00:47:54.405 --> 00:47:55.941
Be quiet!
I won't hear another word!

616
00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:59.710
[tense music]

617
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:06.918
That is the most...

618
00:48:09.054 --> 00:48:12.157
Tell this man that if
he repeats such absurdities,
I'll arrest him, Chuma.

619
00:48:12.323 --> 00:48:14.392
-Yes, but--
-And you as well,
do you understand?

620
00:48:20.265 --> 00:48:21.699
The idea's absurd.

621
00:48:24.435 --> 00:48:26.604
I'm supposed to accept
this was some sort of

622
00:48:26.771 --> 00:48:29.707
acrobatic ritual
murder and suicide?

623
00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:32.577
It's not only absurd,
it's an insult.

624
00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:34.245
Those men were with me
for years. I trained them.

625
00:48:34.412 --> 00:48:37.082
-Major, please, please try--
-I don't need opinions, Merrin.

626
00:48:40.051 --> 00:48:42.220
I've been lenient
with you people, Chuma,

627
00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:44.755
but warn the elders

628
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:47.925
that unless they hand over
the men that did this,

629
00:48:48.526 --> 00:48:51.896
life in these parts will
become distinctly less pleasant.

630
00:48:52.063 --> 00:48:54.966
[tense music]

631
00:48:59.404 --> 00:49:01.139
I will get to
the bottom of this.

632
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:06.777
Major, please.

633
00:49:07.145 --> 00:49:09.780
Do not choose the wrong side
in this, Merrin.

634
00:49:14.585 --> 00:49:15.987
Remember what you owe...

635
00:49:17.188 --> 00:49:18.356
to whom.

636
00:49:20.258 --> 00:49:21.692
The wrong side, major?

637
00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:23.794
This is not war.

638
00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:30.501
-[insects chirping]
-[indistinct chattering]

639
00:49:37.842 --> 00:49:39.144
[animal yowls]

640
00:49:53.224 --> 00:49:54.492
Hello, Rachel.

641
00:49:55.426 --> 00:49:57.962
-Is he all right?
-[Rachel] Take a look.

642
00:50:01.366 --> 00:50:03.834
He started to run a fever
early this morning.

643
00:50:05.303 --> 00:50:07.772
And there was a warmth
radiating from the cast.

644
00:50:08.873 --> 00:50:11.609
I took it off,
expecting to find gangrene.

645
00:50:12.777 --> 00:50:14.812
You can imagine my shock.

646
00:50:16.681 --> 00:50:17.882
[Merrin] So it's better.

647
00:50:18.049 --> 00:50:20.151
It's on its way to being healed.

648
00:50:22.553 --> 00:50:25.323
This should have taken weeks

649
00:50:26.391 --> 00:50:27.792
not days.

650
00:50:30.195 --> 00:50:31.662
And the fever's dropping.

651
00:50:37.202 --> 00:50:38.503
I only hope that...

652
00:50:41.106 --> 00:50:42.140
Hope what?

653
00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:48.079
There are cases of
false recovery of a...

654
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.750
body's system
appearing to improve

655
00:50:53.384 --> 00:50:56.187
but it's actually evidence
of a deeper problem.

656
00:50:59.357 --> 00:51:01.192
Any reason to believe
that's the case?

657
00:51:01.359 --> 00:51:03.761
[gentle music]

658
00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:07.064
No.

659
00:51:07.932 --> 00:51:09.400
No, there isn't.

660
00:51:10.435 --> 00:51:13.704
So--so many terrible things
have happened
in the last few days,

661
00:51:14.739 --> 00:51:17.041
you just can't see
a good thing for what it is.

662
00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:23.914
I'm just glad there is something
to be grateful for.

663
00:51:26.117 --> 00:51:29.454
This village has been
on the verge of an explosion.

664
00:51:31.389 --> 00:51:33.424
I don't know
who's more likely to ignite it,

665
00:51:34.292 --> 00:51:35.693
Granville or the Turkana.

666
00:51:38.863 --> 00:51:40.131
Mara quit.

667
00:51:41.499 --> 00:51:42.733
Oh?

668
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.635
The elders told her
not to work here.

669
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:46.571
Because of the baby?

670
00:51:47.972 --> 00:51:49.240
That's part of it.

671
00:51:49.974 --> 00:51:53.478
[woman yelling in Turkana]

672
00:51:53.644 --> 00:51:56.581
-[people yelling]
-[whistle blowing]

673
00:51:58.216 --> 00:51:59.984
[dramatic music]

674
00:52:36.387 --> 00:52:37.622
What's happening?

675
00:52:46.597 --> 00:52:48.299
I suppose you've all
had a good laugh

676
00:52:48.466 --> 00:52:51.001
thinking what fools you've
made of the British Empire.

677
00:52:53.238 --> 00:52:54.772
But you've fooled no one.

678
00:52:56.374 --> 00:52:58.309
I told you I'd get
to the bottom of this.

679
00:52:58.876 --> 00:53:01.579
Major, please stop this.
You don't understand.

680
00:53:02.313 --> 00:53:03.548
Sergeant major!

681
00:53:05.516 --> 00:53:08.453
-Sir.
-I want these people
kept at a distance.

682
00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:11.021
If they attempt to interfere,
they're to be arrested.

683
00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:12.357
And if they resist, shoot them.

684
00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:15.159
-Sir?
-Do it!

685
00:53:16.361 --> 00:53:17.362
Yes, sir!

686
00:53:18.229 --> 00:53:19.464
Not him.

687
00:53:20.064 --> 00:53:21.466
I'll need an interpreter.

688
00:53:22.066 --> 00:53:24.001
-And interpret carefully, Chuma.
-[ominous whirring]

689
00:53:24.469 --> 00:53:27.938
Tell them I have waited
long enough to find out
who killed my men.

690
00:53:28.906 --> 00:53:32.076
This is a small town.
One of them must know
who is responsible.

691
00:53:32.243 --> 00:53:33.578
-[speaking Turkana]
-I'll give them one more chance

692
00:53:33.744 --> 00:53:35.546
for that person to reveal
the murderer's name.

693
00:53:35.713 --> 00:53:38.683
-Major!
-Mind your own, priest.

694
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:41.552
[speaking Turkana]

695
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.756
Sebituana says that
everybody knows that
your men killed each other.

696
00:53:46.757 --> 00:53:48.125
They were stealing and
they went mad--

697
00:53:48.326 --> 00:53:49.660
-Shut your mouth!
-[grunts]

698
00:53:51.496 --> 00:53:53.398
You think you're the law here,
do you?

699
00:53:53.931 --> 00:53:57.067
You go on hiding your murderers
because you don't fear me yet.

700
00:53:57.802 --> 00:54:00.204
-Well, my friend,
let me assure you--
-Major, stop this!

701
00:54:00.371 --> 00:54:02.607
...if a reason for fear
is what you need,

702
00:54:02.773 --> 00:54:05.109
then I can oblige!

703
00:54:05.676 --> 00:54:07.578
-[gunshot]
-[people shouting]

704
00:54:07.745 --> 00:54:09.747
[dramatic music]

705
00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:16.754
[Sergeant Major] Hold that man!

706
00:54:22.126 --> 00:54:23.260
[ominous music]

707
00:54:23.428 --> 00:54:24.562
<i>Appa?</i>

708
00:54:24.895 --> 00:54:27.097
[tense music]

709
00:54:30.801 --> 00:54:32.470
-Corporal Williams.
-[Williams] Sergeant major.

710
00:54:32.637 --> 00:54:34.505
Have the men stand down
and fall in by the lorry.

711
00:54:34.705 --> 00:54:36.106
Allow the natives
to tidy this up.

712
00:54:37.675 --> 00:54:39.276
-[Williams] Move it!
-[Sergeant Major] Private Evans!
Sentry on the guard wall!

713
00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:41.979
Places on the guard wall!

714
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.415
Stand guard
on the perimeter wall!

715
00:54:44.582 --> 00:54:46.751
Sir. To the car, sir.

716
00:54:56.727 --> 00:55:03.401
[soldier] Left, right, left.
Left, right, left, right, left,
right, left.

717
00:55:05.169 --> 00:55:09.840
[demonic voice whispering]

718
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:15.312
[ominous music]

719
00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:22.787
[Merrin]
I'm sorry I startled you.

720
00:55:28.493 --> 00:55:30.294
Did you manage
to sleep through the night?

721
00:55:33.731 --> 00:55:34.832
Yes.

722
00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:40.705
I wish I could say the same
for Rachel.

723
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.109
She woke several times
after you left.

724
00:55:54.985 --> 00:55:57.087
Seemed afraid something
might happen to the boy.

725
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:02.993
She finally calmed down
when I said
I'd watch over him, which...

726
00:56:04.328 --> 00:56:05.896
which seemed
the least I could do.

727
00:56:06.997 --> 00:56:09.066
-Don't.
-Don't what?

728
00:56:10.568 --> 00:56:13.771
Don't acknowledge the fact
that I was the one that
asked Granville to come?

729
00:56:16.006 --> 00:56:17.542
You didn't ask him
to shoot the girl.

730
00:56:18.175 --> 00:56:20.511
There's only one person
responsible for what happened.

731
00:56:21.879 --> 00:56:22.913
How is he?

732
00:56:27.051 --> 00:56:28.486
[Francis] He seems fine.

733
00:56:29.954 --> 00:56:32.089
Um, I'll take over.

734
00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:34.725
You've got things to do.

735
00:56:38.696 --> 00:56:41.098
[tense music]

736
00:56:44.401 --> 00:56:45.936
Not much, I'm afraid.

737
00:56:47.838 --> 00:56:49.507
I doubt there'll be
much of a class.

738
00:56:50.475 --> 00:56:54.278
Well, the children seem to
genuinely like school and you.

739
00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:56.947
I'm sure some of them
will turn up.

740
00:56:58.282 --> 00:56:59.283
Are you all right, Merrin?

741
00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.788
Is it cold in here?

742
00:57:03.954 --> 00:57:05.990
[somber music]

743
00:57:20.971 --> 00:57:22.239
Prayer, Merrin.

744
00:57:23.073 --> 00:57:24.942
It's all we have
at times like these.

745
00:57:25.643 --> 00:57:26.644
[Merrin] Yeah.

746
00:57:30.314 --> 00:57:31.982
It's like having nothing,
isn't it?

747
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:42.359
Lankester.

748
00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:51.001
May I speak to you
at a personal level?

749
00:57:52.903 --> 00:57:54.104
Of course.

750
00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.373
Christian to Christian?

751
00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.850
"Evil may gain sway
over our lives for a time

752
00:58:07.351 --> 00:58:09.219
but the ultimate
power of faith

753
00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:11.488
lies in its ability to
strengthen men.

754
00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:15.292
Not to conquer evil,
but to survive it."

755
00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:17.294
You wrote that. I read it.

756
00:58:18.996 --> 00:58:20.898
A young man's theories.

757
00:58:21.766 --> 00:58:23.167
But you proved it.

758
00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:26.236
I survived, if that's
what you mean.

759
00:58:27.605 --> 00:58:28.573
But did I live?

760
00:58:29.674 --> 00:58:30.675
Not really.

761
00:58:31.976 --> 00:58:34.378
He didn't force you
to wander from him.

762
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.914
He allowed you to

763
00:58:37.982 --> 00:58:38.983
out of love.

764
00:58:41.018 --> 00:58:42.252
And if you find now
that you're lost,

765
00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:45.890
you must have faith that
his love will guide you back.

766
00:58:46.957 --> 00:58:48.525
All you have to do is ask.

767
00:58:54.298 --> 00:58:56.634
You mean well,
but you can't see my soul.

768
00:58:56.801 --> 00:58:59.336
[tense music]

769
00:58:59.503 --> 00:59:01.739
I'm God's servant. He can.

770
00:59:12.216 --> 00:59:14.151
[music continues]

771
00:59:20.157 --> 00:59:22.960
[speaking Turkana]

772
00:59:27.431 --> 00:59:28.432
Well...

773
00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:31.769
I didn't think I would see
so many of you today.

774
00:59:32.903 --> 00:59:36.240
When you go home, you must
remember to thank your families.

775
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:38.108
Their families not know, Father.

776
00:59:38.275 --> 00:59:40.210
Their parents tell them
they must not come.

777
00:59:40.544 --> 00:59:42.813
They say that Jesus Christ
killed Falashadey.

778
00:59:45.382 --> 00:59:47.852
Falashadey, that was her name?

779
00:59:48.719 --> 00:59:52.189
They come to school
because they think
if they do not come

780
00:59:52.356 --> 00:59:54.491
maybe Jesus Christ
might kill them too.

781
00:59:58.629 --> 01:00:00.564
Joseph, James, come here.

782
01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:08.105
Jesus Christ did not kill
that young woman.

783
01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:10.741
The British major did.

784
01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.477
And it was very, very wrong.

785
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:15.412
[door bangs]

786
01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:19.583
Jomo, no. You must not.

787
01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:21.385
[blow thuds]

788
01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:23.453
[dramatic music]

789
01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:27.825
[people screaming]

790
01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:33.764
[intense music]

791
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:41.638
[gunshot]

792
01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:43.640
[tense music]

793
01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:46.777
[speaking Turkana]

794
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.817
Anderson, get some medical help
in here.

795
01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:54.151
[Emekwi] Joseph!

796
01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:56.553
[James crying]

797
01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:02.893
-My son.
-[James crying]

798
01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:11.736
What did he say?

799
01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.640
-What did he say?
-He said...

800
01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:21.178
that he had to kill them
to stop the Christian evil
from spreading.

801
01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:25.682
This, Father?

802
01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:31.756
Is this how the Almighty
treats those who have
kept faith with him?

803
01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.058
Yes.

804
01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.896
[music continues]

805
01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:47.571
[Francis] No.

806
01:01:49.573 --> 01:01:51.208
[sobbing]

807
01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.548
[insects chirping]

808
01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:09.960
[tense music]

809
01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:17.434
Father. Father Francis.

810
01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:18.969
What is it? What's happened?

811
01:02:19.904 --> 01:02:21.839
I think you'd better
see for yourself.

812
01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:28.378
My...

813
01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:29.613
My God.

814
01:02:31.015 --> 01:02:33.583
-How did you...?
-I didn't.

815
01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.086
Not intentionally.

816
01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:39.924
This may be more your province
than mine, Father.

817
01:02:42.026 --> 01:02:43.327
[Francis] It's a miracle.

818
01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:51.768
I have to get Merrin.

819
01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:55.672
Will you be all right?

820
01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.242
Yes.

821
01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.585
[door shuts]

822
01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.040
Maybe you...

823
01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:33.410
are the one proof of God
in this terrible place.

824
01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:44.955
Because you're certainly
the only innocent creature.

825
01:04:01.105 --> 01:04:03.941
[demonic voice whispering]

826
01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.978
[demonic voice shouting]

827
01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.547
[panting]

828
01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:15.986
You know my guilt?

829
01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:32.036
The spirit of our Savior.

830
01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:34.671
It's in you.

831
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.043
And it will point the way
out of this darkness.

832
01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.580
O Lord.

833
01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:46.750
Lord, I pray thee,

834
01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:50.387
hear my voice
as I have heard thine.

835
01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:55.059
Let this blessed child
continue to be thy messenger...

836
01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:00.430
that we may know thy will...

837
01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:05.535
and thy wisdom.

838
01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:16.480
In the name of the Father,
of the Son and
of the Holy Ghost.

839
01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:36.200
God bless this child.

840
01:05:38.235 --> 01:05:40.170
-[flesh sizzling]
-[roaring]

841
01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:41.972
[dramatic music]

842
01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:45.809
[demonic voice] Don't ever touch
me with that again, priest!

843
01:05:45.976 --> 01:05:48.512
-[gasps]
-[intense music]

844
01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.087
[insects chirping]

845
01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:00.157
[tense music]

846
01:06:19.343 --> 01:06:20.344
[gasping]

847
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.512
[flesh sizzling]

848
01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:30.620
[engine rumbling]

849
01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.472
The boy must be baptized.

850
01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.545
You're still recovering from
that blow to the head, Father.

851
01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:58.382
That's an awfully weak attempt
to explain this away.

852
01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:00.084
Yes, it is.

853
01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:01.785
Then you accept it?

854
01:07:02.986 --> 01:07:04.888
An evil spirit at work in
this town? I didn't say that.

855
01:07:05.055 --> 01:07:06.823
-[scoffs]
-Things you think you heard,

856
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:09.393
-the things you think you saw--
-You're saying
I'm hallucinating.

857
01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:13.097
What about the burn
on his forehead?
Did I imagine that?

858
01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.365
It's an injury
in the rough shape of a cross.

859
01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:16.800
The rough shape.

860
01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:19.403
-You've had a nervous
breakdown--
-Breakdown?!

861
01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.839
Oh, I think it's you who have
been through too much, Merrin.

862
01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.709
Will you please try
to control yourselves?

863
01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:27.911
The boy needs rest.

864
01:07:29.012 --> 01:07:30.547
And what about
his perfect English?

865
01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.050
Oh, of course,
I must be imagining that too.

866
01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:38.855
All right.

867
01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:42.192
Let's assume
what you say is true.

868
01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.262
What harm could there be
in his being baptized?

869
01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:48.432
A great deal. Those people hate
and fear Cheche.

870
01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.135
You want to expose him
to further danger

871
01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:53.437
by having him join a religion
they equate with evil?

872
01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:56.039
Oh, say it. Say it, Merrin.
Or can't you?

873
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:59.476
-The work of Satan.
-It's the work of man!

874
01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:02.279
-Why can't you accept that?
-Because my only concern

875
01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:04.281
is the eternal soul
of that young man.

876
01:08:07.984 --> 01:08:09.519
Are you so arrogant, Merrin,

877
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.657
that you would involve
the rest of the world
in your crisis of faith?

878
01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:17.761
That you would deny to someone
what you once cherished

879
01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.563
simply because you now doubt it?

880
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.302
What makes you think he wants
it?

881
01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:27.471
You could try asking him.

882
01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:29.973
He's awake now.

883
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:49.125

See.

886
01:08:57.334 --> 01:09:00.437
Doctor, please,
would you ask him
if he would like to become

887
01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:02.672
a Christian like
<i>Appa</i> and myself?

888
01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:04.608
Unless you object.

889
01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:06.310

-He would like it.
-Good.

893
01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.995
-Good, Cheche. Good.
-He wants to do it
in the church.

894
01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:29.999
He seems to think
that's where you live.

895
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:34.471
He wants to be as much
like you as he can.

896
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.674
Unless you want to explain
your misgivings to him.

897
01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:43.913
There's a beautiful baptismal
font in the church.

898
01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:46.416
We could use that.

Major Granville, sir.

902
01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:50.914
Sir, are you...

903
01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:54.217
Are you all right, sir?

904
01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:56.753
All right.

905
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.762
I shall be down in a moment.

906
01:11:08.732 --> 01:11:09.733
Sir.

907
01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.103
Oh, and sergeant major.

908
01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:16.139
Sir?

909
01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.242
I shall need you to give
Mr. Merrin a message.

910
01:11:21.244 --> 01:11:22.412
Tell him...

911
01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:28.452
Tell him I know now
how it's been for him
all these years.

912
01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.356
But tell him there's no way out.

913
01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:37.193
Other than...

-Sir!

[tense music]

916
01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.782
I just need one or two more
things from the hotel, doctor.

917
01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:01.117
-I'll have him ready, Father.
-Thank you.

-[soldier] Up!
-[Sergeant Major] Leave it.

920
01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:31.548
Don't bother, doctor.

921
01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:35.151
He asked me
to give you a message
before he'd shot himself.

922
01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.127
Said he understood
what you were going through

923
01:12:44.494 --> 01:12:46.896
and that this was
the only way out.
Any idea what he meant?

924
01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:50.800
No.

925
01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.570
He never meant to
kill that girl.

926
01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:56.139
That went against every part
of the major's nature.

927
01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:58.975
-[ominous whirring]
-Something got into him.

928

some of the boys, they, uh...

930
01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:11.821
They're not too happy.
The major was well liked.

931
01:13:12.822 --> 01:13:15.358
So if you have any pull
with the spearchuckers,

932
01:13:16.426 --> 01:13:18.828
I'd advise them to step quietly.

[somber music]

934
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:23.500

01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:38.702
But get on the radio to town.

947

Okay. We're gonna go down.

Just like that.

951
01:15:54.618 --> 01:15:55.819

01:24:58.894 --> 01:25:00.929
Tell her she must come,
tell her it's Father Francis.

1061
01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:03.532
It's him. It's him.

1062
01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:06.569
[tense music]

1063
01:25:10.072 --> 01:25:11.140
It's him.

1064
01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:12.975
You'll be fine. Give me a hand!

1065
01:25:13.376 --> 01:25:15.778
[growling]

1066
01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.447
It's him.

1067
01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:20.783
It's him.

1068
01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:25.688
[tense music]

1069
01:25:30.493 --> 01:25:32.027
Thank you for coming, Mara.

1070
01:25:32.995 --> 01:25:34.830
I did it for Father Francis.

1071
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:38.901
Where is Miss Rachel?

1072
01:25:40.303 --> 01:25:41.304
At the dig.

1073
01:25:43.939 --> 01:25:45.641
[Francis wheezes]

1074
01:25:50.613 --> 01:25:53.081
-Yes?
-Unction, Father.

1075
01:25:55.784 --> 01:25:57.720
I need the last rites.

1076
01:25:58.687 --> 01:25:59.788
No.

1077
01:26:00.323 --> 01:26:02.691
-You'll be all right.
-My immortal--

1078
01:26:03.125 --> 01:26:04.760
My immortal soul

1079
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:07.763
is in danger. Please.

1080
01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:10.699
Please, Merrin.

1081
01:26:12.968 --> 01:26:14.337
Please get the kit.

1082
01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:16.439
Please.

1083
01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:20.209
[somber music]

1084
01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:33.856
You'll need the book of
Roman rituals.

1085
01:26:35.291 --> 01:26:36.725
It's in my room.

1086
01:26:37.493 --> 01:26:41.029
-I haven't forgotten
the last rites.
-Not for that.

1087
01:26:43.466 --> 01:26:45.434
You'll need it
for the rite of exorcism.

1088
01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:47.370
You can't make that decision.

1089
01:26:48.237 --> 01:26:49.838
The archbishop
needs to be contacted.

1090
01:26:50.005 --> 01:26:51.574
There's no time.

1091
01:26:54.777 --> 01:26:56.979
He's in the boy.

1092
01:26:59.915 --> 01:27:03.752
Oh, God help us.
He's in the boy.

1093
01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.891
-Any progress?
-No.

1094
01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:12.227
-How's Father Francis?
-He's resting.

1095
01:27:12.395 --> 01:27:13.729
Savages.

1096
01:27:15.298 --> 01:27:16.932
If they think they can get
away with this, they don't
understand the British.

1097
01:27:21.504 --> 01:27:24.072
-[rumbling]
-Look out!

1098
01:27:37.152 --> 01:27:39.322
Chuma, are you all right?

1099
01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:44.327
Don't go in!

1100
01:27:48.731 --> 01:27:51.600
Look after Chuma.
Don't follow me.

1101
01:27:52.835 --> 01:27:55.404
[ominous music]

1102
01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:58.874
Rachel?

1103
01:27:59.174 --> 01:28:00.643
[indistinct whispering]

1104
01:28:14.156 --> 01:28:15.424
Rachel?

1105
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:17.326
[shaky breathing]

1106
01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:43.786
[shaky breathing]

1107
01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:45.988
Is that you, Rachel?

1108
01:28:47.523 --> 01:28:50.058
[music continues]

1109
01:28:55.798 --> 01:28:57.466
[whimpering]

1110

-[match striking]
-[dramatic music]

1111
01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:15.551
[whispering] Rachel.

1112
01:29:17.386 --> 01:29:18.521
Rachel.

1113
01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:20.823
Rachel, wake up.

1114
01:29:22.157 --> 01:29:23.826
Wake up, you're dreaming.

1115
01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:25.828
Rachel.

1116
01:29:26.662 --> 01:29:27.696
Wake up.

1117
01:29:29.331 --> 01:29:30.833
-Where's Cheche?
-No.

1118
01:29:33.402 --> 01:29:34.670
I was there.

1119
01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:38.040
It was so real.

1120
01:29:39.408 --> 01:29:42.044
-Chelmno.
-No, you were dreaming.

1121
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.647
-You were dreaming.
You are here.
-I wanted to be--

1122
01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.816
I want to be back.
He took me there.

1123
01:29:49.251 --> 01:29:51.820
-You were dreaming, that's all.
-But I want to go back.

1124
01:29:51.987 --> 01:29:54.457
You have to let me.
It was different, I was helping.

1125
01:29:54.657 --> 01:29:56.258
-You can go!
-Rachel!

1126
01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.561
I'm sorry.

1127
01:30:00.863 --> 01:30:02.097
I'm sorry, Rachel.

1128
01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:07.035
-I'm sorry.
-We can help each other.

1129
01:30:10.973 --> 01:30:13.041
Only we can help each other.

1130
01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:16.879
Rachel.

1131
01:30:17.513 --> 01:30:19.347
We're the same, you and I.

1132
01:30:19.515 --> 01:30:21.249
[gentle music]

1133
01:30:23.552 --> 01:30:25.854
[tense music]

1134
01:30:26.822 --> 01:30:29.725
[Satanic voice]
You're a passionate man, Merrin.

1135
01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:34.497
Full of hunger.

1136
01:30:42.905 --> 01:30:44.840
[music continues]

1137
01:30:47.476 --> 01:30:48.644
Get out.

1138
01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:50.579
Now.

1139
01:30:58.821 --> 01:31:00.723
[breathing heavily]

1140
01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:02.958
You call me cruel.

1141
01:31:03.792 --> 01:31:06.595
Rachel was rewriting her past.

1142
01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:10.265
Then you destroyed it.

1143
01:31:11.767 --> 01:31:13.135
You're the great deceiver.

1144
01:31:15.437 --> 01:31:17.172
[dramatic music]

1145
01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:23.812
Did Father Francis mention me?

1146
01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:26.181
He called you Satan.

1147
01:31:29.184 --> 01:31:32.354
Did I not roll away
the stones for you?

1148
01:31:32.855 --> 01:31:34.322
Why torment Rachel?

1149
01:31:35.624 --> 01:31:36.625
She's not the one who sinned.

1150
01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.194
[breathes heavily]

1151
01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:41.630
She never helped
another prisoner.

1152
01:31:43.966 --> 01:31:46.334
She traded her body for food.

1153
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.971
[tense music]

1154
01:31:49.137 --> 01:31:51.006
She betrayed her friends.

1155
01:31:51.907 --> 01:31:55.978
-Liar!
-You hate God, Merrin.

1156
01:31:56.411 --> 01:31:59.715
And why not?
God gives you guilt.

1157
01:32:01.717 --> 01:32:03.385
The guilt is unbearable.

1158
01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:08.223
[whispering] I do not curse God.

1159
01:32:09.424 --> 01:32:10.458
[Cheche in Satanic voice] But...

1160
01:32:14.196 --> 01:32:16.498
there is one thing you can do.

1161
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:21.403
You can cease to care.

1162
01:32:24.139 --> 01:32:25.540
That is your offer?

1163
01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:30.078
I offer freedom.

1164
01:32:31.446 --> 01:32:32.681
[ominous music]

1165
01:32:32.848 --> 01:32:34.216
Run.

1166
01:32:34.817 --> 01:32:37.552
Run, Merrin, run.

1167
01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:43.325
[Merrin] You tried me, Lord.

1168
01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.094
I failed.

1169
01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:49.598
Forgive my disbelief.

1170
01:32:52.067 --> 01:32:53.568
Help my disbelief.

1171
01:32:57.372 --> 01:32:59.507
Take my disbelief into
your bosom

1172
01:32:59.675 --> 01:33:00.943
and give me strength.

1173
01:33:04.546 --> 01:33:06.849
Absolve my sins and purify me.

1174
01:33:09.852 --> 01:33:11.720
Purify me for this task.

1175
01:33:15.057 --> 01:33:17.793
[somber music]

1176
01:34:16.284 --> 01:34:19.654
Everything was good in Derati
until the missionary came.

1177
01:34:22.657 --> 01:34:24.326
Jomo may have held the spear,

1178
01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.662
but Father Francis
killed my son.

[speaking Turkana]

1181
01:35:12.741 --> 01:35:14.843
[Sergeant Major] Easy, boys.

1182
01:35:16.411 --> 01:35:17.813
Let Mr. Merrin through.

1183
01:35:17.946 --> 01:35:20.415
[tense music]

1184
01:35:25.187 --> 01:35:26.254
Or is it Father Merrin?

1185
01:35:26.421 --> 01:35:28.156
Christ, have mercy on us.

1186
01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:30.625
Lord, have mercy on us.

1187
01:35:30.826 --> 01:35:33.796
Better not come out, priest,
if you know what's good for you.

1188
01:35:33.996 --> 01:35:34.997
[Merrin]
Christ, have mercy on us.

1189
01:35:35.130 --> 01:35:36.865
[Sergeant Major]
Blood will flow tonight.

1190
01:35:37.032 --> 01:35:38.566
[Merrin] Lord, have mercy on us.

Christ, hear us.

1202

God, the Father of heaven,
have mercy on us.

1203

-God, the Son...
-It's not working.

1204
01:37:38.286 --> 01:37:39.888
[Merrin] Redeemer of the world,

1205
01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:41.589
have mercy on us.

1206
01:37:42.624 --> 01:37:45.027
Oh, God, the Holy Ghost,
have mercy on us.

1207
01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.730
Holy Trinity, one God,
have mercy on us.

1208
01:37:49.331 --> 01:37:50.899
You're a weak vessel.

A weak vessel leaks.

1214
01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:15.357
It is not only me
who fights you.

1215
01:38:16.491 --> 01:38:17.759
I'm not alone.

1216

I'm Father Merrin.

1260

And these people confess to you?

1261
01:41:10.698 --> 01:41:12.267
So point out the one
who's responsible.

1262
01:41:12.834 --> 01:41:14.202
No one here did this,
lieutenant.

1263

They aren't capable of it.

-That God is not here today?

Yes, I know that.

demonstrate to this wretch

who did little else.

to irritate me, Father.

1280

Tell your men to lay down
their weapons and leave.

Priest or no,
I swear I will kill you.

You'll get what satisfaction
you want, priest,
