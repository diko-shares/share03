1
00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:06.163
I am Obersturmfuhrer
Rolf Kessel from the SS.

2
00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:08.332
And this is one of my men.

3
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:11.737
We found him in a ditch with
a kitchen knife in his back.

4
00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:14.160
Murdered by one of you.

5
00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:18.206
You see the German army retreating,
and it makes you feel hope.

6
00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:20.552
It should not.

7
00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:24.918
So who is responsible for this?

8
00:01:25.558 --> 00:01:28.001
You, priest.

9
00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.527
What's your name?
I'm Father Merrin.

10
00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:38.946
Father Merrin.
These people confess to you?

11
00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:41.615
Yes.
So point out the one who is responsible.

12
00:01:41.616 --> 00:01:43.867
No one here did this, lieutenant.

13
00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:45.827
They aren't capable of it.

14
00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.122
Father, you must help me with this.

15
00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:51.792
Oh, but how?
Well, I need someone.

16
00:01:51.793 --> 00:01:53.794
Do you understand?

17
00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:57.172
Surely there is one among them
who beats his wife or his children.

18
00:01:57.173 --> 00:01:58.674
A thief, perhaps.

19
00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:01.760
Every town has someone it
can do without. Point him out.

20
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:04.288
There is no murderer here.

21
00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:10.060
I have good news for you.

22
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:14.022
You are all innocent.
Your priest has told me so.

23
00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:17.317
The murderer is no doubt
lurking in the countryside

24
00:02:17.318 --> 00:02:21.553
waiting to strike at the next
group of German soldiers.

25
00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:26.910
I am going to shoot 10 of you

26
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:30.873
in the hope that we can
demonstrate to this wretch

27
00:02:30.874 --> 00:02:35.073
the responsibility he has incurred.

28
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.463
A worker's hand.
Farmer.

29
00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:40.757
Excellent.
No!

30
00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:43.830
We will start with you.
Stop!

31
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.963
You have some objection, Father?
In God's name, you cannot do this.

32
00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:53.637
You choose.

33
00:02:55.106 --> 00:02:57.733
What?
Well, they're your flock.

34
00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:00.806
You live among them. So you choose.

35
00:03:02.071 --> 00:03:03.934
I will not.

36
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.618
You give me 10 of them,
or I will kill them all.

37
00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.560
Men, women and children.

38
00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:16.501
Shoot me.
You have five seconds.

39
00:03:16.503 --> 00:03:19.463
I can't.
You can't what?

40
00:03:19.464 --> 00:03:21.298
Pick who will be sacrificed?

41
00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.469
History is full of priests
who did little else.

42
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.495
You begin to irritate me, Father.

43
00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:41.720
That was for making me wait.

44
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.182
I still want 10 more names.

45
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:48.520
What are you doing, Father?
Are you praying?

46
00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:51.234
To God?

47
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:56.402
It's all right, Father.
I'll let you pray.

48
00:03:56.835 --> 00:03:59.378
Because I know something.

49
00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.296
You see

50
00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:07.748
God isn't here today.

51
00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:18.715
You win.

52
00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.301
Shoot them all.
No! Wait!

53
00:04:32.203 --> 00:04:34.231
Joost Harmensz, take him.

54
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.584
Too late, Father. You had your chance.
No, please.

55
00:04:38.585 --> 00:04:41.111
Take Joost. And Jon.

56
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.972
That's good.

57
00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.429
And who shall be next?

58
00:05:31.054 --> 00:05:32.702
That's him.

59
00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.723
He's Dutch, you say?

60
00:05:34.724 --> 00:05:37.749
Half. His mother was English.

61
00:05:38.895 --> 00:05:41.730
Perhaps he'll be a bit
more inclined to see reason then.

62
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:43.982
I wouldn't be
concerned about reason, major.

63
00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:45.484
He's a scholar.

64
00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.778
We studied his works at
the Maryknoll Center.

65
00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:50.280
Oh, yes.

66
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:52.449
You Maryknolls.

67
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.701
Cropping up everywhere these days.

68
00:05:54.702 --> 00:05:58.872
It's a wonder the Jesuits don't get
after you for poaching their game.

69
00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:01.625
We all serve in the same
cause, Major Granville.

70
00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:03.627
He's not one of yours?
No.

71
00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:06.421
A simple parish priest from Holland.

72
00:06:06.422 --> 00:06:10.342
When did he develop
this archaeological bent?

73
00:06:10.343 --> 00:06:12.302
Right after the war.

74
00:06:12.303 --> 00:06:15.138
There was an incident.
Yes.

75
00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.211
Yes, I heard.

76
00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:21.834
And his standing in the Church now?

77
00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:26.473
Undecided.

78
00:06:27.402 --> 00:06:32.265
The site is right west of Lake
Rudolf, in the Turkana district.

79
00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:37.857
It's Early Christian, which makes for
quite a mystery given its location.

80
00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:42.749
Anyway

81
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.253
we won't know more about it
until we get inside the thing.

82
00:06:46.254 --> 00:06:50.424
I'd only uncovered a small portion
of the roof before I got

83
00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:52.426
summoned here.

84
00:06:52.427 --> 00:06:54.845
Did you feel summoned?

85
00:06:54.846 --> 00:06:57.306
I am sorry.

86
00:06:57.307 --> 00:07:00.414
It's a question of status, you see.

87
00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:03.312
My status?

88
00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:06.773
Officially, you're still
listed as a displaced person.

89
00:07:06.774 --> 00:07:09.182
I wonder

90
00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:15.187
why didn't you take steps
to clear the matter up?

91
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.311
I've been busy.

92
00:07:21.623 --> 00:07:23.707
Beautiful, aren't they?

93
00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:25.375
Yes, very.

94
00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:28.295
Are you a lepidopterist?
A hobby.

95
00:07:28.296 --> 00:07:30.538
From school days.

96
00:07:32.717 --> 00:07:35.409
You have been busy.

97
00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:40.331
Six archaeological
digs since the war.

98
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.000
This is the longest.

99
00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:45.979
If this is an official matter

100
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.483
then what is he doing here?
Father Francis?

101
00:07:49.484 --> 00:07:52.486
Well, for one thing,
he's quite an admirer of yours.

102
00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:55.739
I'm about to begin missionary
work in the Turkana district.

103
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.242
I thought maybe we
could help each other.

104
00:07:58.243 --> 00:08:01.694
You know a lot about the people.
I'd rather not. Thank you.

105
00:08:03.957 --> 00:08:06.649
This is a little awkward.

106
00:08:06.793 --> 00:08:09.711
Cardinal Jenkins is
somewhat concerned

107
00:08:09.712 --> 00:08:12.130
about an exploration
of this significance

108
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:15.300
conducted by a priest
who is on sabbatical.

109
00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:19.750
Temporary sabbatical.
Which comes up for review shortly.

110
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.147
Perhaps I should take
this up with the governor's office.

111
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:31.924
They'd only send you back to me.

112
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:38.477
Why don't you have a seat, Merrin.

113
00:08:41.953 --> 00:08:44.811
You sure you won't have that drink?

114
00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:55.924
The cardinal wants to be sure
that the site's religious aspects

115
00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:58.176
are given proper consideration.

116
00:08:58.178 --> 00:08:59.845
Part of Father Francis' job

117
00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:02.556
will be to see to that.
Are you an archaeologist?

118
00:09:02.557 --> 00:09:05.546
You're not the sole person
with an interest here.

119
00:09:07.437 --> 00:09:12.482
I've contacted your sponsors
at Oxford. They have no objection.

120
00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:17.228
If you agree as well, I can
renew your visa immediately.

121
00:09:19.824 --> 00:09:25.400
We all must make our little
deals with the devil, Merrin.

122
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.633
Before there were the mines,
traders came to Derati for the water.

123
00:09:37.634 --> 00:09:40.290
They still do

124
00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:44.206
but it is a hard life.

125
00:09:46.893 --> 00:09:50.103
Why in God's name are they
tormenting that animal?

126
00:09:50.104 --> 00:09:52.689
It is a sacrifice.

127
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.192
The new wife of the chief elder

128
00:09:55.193 --> 00:09:58.445
Sebituana, will soon give birth.

129
00:09:58.446 --> 00:10:01.198
Sebituana does not yet have an heir.

130
00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:06.768
So the people make sacrifices in the
hope that the gods will provide one.

131
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:10.988
It is a necessary thing.

132
00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:13.403
Cruelty is never necessary, Chuma.

133
00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:15.738
You think we are savages?

134
00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:19.341
I think some of you
are good people

135
00:10:19.342 --> 00:10:21.619
lost in confusion.

136
00:10:21.803 --> 00:10:25.889
There's nothing confusing
about that ceremony, Father.

137
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.476
They're weakening the bull so
that someone can approach it.

138
00:10:29.477 --> 00:10:33.397
And as for some of the Turkana being
savages, you may want to be careful.

139
00:10:33.398 --> 00:10:36.553
Sebituana back there
is Chuma's cousin.

140
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.848
Welcome back.

141
00:11:21.529 --> 00:11:25.490
Did you bring the supplies?
Yes. They're in the back of the lorry.

142
00:11:25.492 --> 00:11:28.118
Chuma, could you get
Rachel's medical supplies?

143
00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:30.120
Here's a letter for you.

144
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.648
How was Nairobi?

145
00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:37.794
Hello. Are you the doctor?
Mm-hm.

146
00:11:37.795 --> 00:11:40.214
Habari Kani, Lankester.

147
00:11:40.215 --> 00:11:43.008
It's good to have you back.

148
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:45.802
Oh, thank you. Your room is prepared.

149
00:11:45.803 --> 00:11:49.473
We'll need another Another room,
Emekwi. This is Father Francis.

150
00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:53.060
You're a friend of Lankester's, Father?
Oh, hello. I hope so.

151
00:11:53.061 --> 00:11:55.812
I've actually come to
open a missionary school.

152
00:11:55.814 --> 00:11:58.815
This is your hotel?
The finest establishment in Derati.

153
00:11:58.817 --> 00:12:01.652
Emekwi here, he's a Christian.
Maybe he can help you.

154
00:12:01.653 --> 00:12:03.320
In any way I can.

155
00:12:03.321 --> 00:12:06.281
James, Joseph.
These are my sons, Father.

156
00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:10.244
They shall be your first pupils,
if you will have them.

157
00:12:10.245 --> 00:12:12.771
That's excellent, Emekwi. Thank you.

158
00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:17.693
Well, then, how far
are we from the site?

159
00:13:14.684 --> 00:13:16.842
Merrin.

160
00:13:18.271 --> 00:13:20.898
How old do you think it is?

161
00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:24.967
Well, the architecture seems
to date to the fifth century.

162
00:13:25.111 --> 00:13:28.030
The Byzantine Empire had
adopted Christianity by then

163
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:31.186
but they never got this far south.

164
00:13:32.535 --> 00:13:34.610
Wanna have a look?

165
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.998
You're?
You're sure it's all right?

166
00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:40.542
Well, so long as you
don't touch anything

167
00:13:40.543 --> 00:13:42.571
and keep an open mind.

168
00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:53.096
It must have been an enormous effort
to get these materials up here.

169
00:13:53.097 --> 00:13:54.598
Up here?

170
00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:58.560
Yes. The stones come from
a quarry near the lake.

171
00:13:58.561 --> 00:14:01.301
Which means a distance

172
00:14:04.275 --> 00:14:06.636
of miles.

173
00:14:09.906 --> 00:14:12.812
It's impossible.

174
00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:17.193
The stones look almost new.

175
00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:23.377
With the wind and sun up here

176
00:14:23.378 --> 00:14:26.319
Well, they should be badly weathered.

177
00:14:28.341 --> 00:14:32.873
The church must have been deliberately
buried right after it was built.

178
00:14:34.097 --> 00:14:37.683
What, they came here and built
something only to bury it?

179
00:14:37.684 --> 00:14:41.353
I don't know. Chuma,
hire some more men.

180
00:14:41.354 --> 00:14:44.924
Have them work double shifts.
I want these walls cleared.

181
00:15:22.729 --> 00:15:27.191
I can't understand it.
Who'd reported it?

182
00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:29.932
Except for this.

183
00:15:35.492 --> 00:15:38.202
I cannot thank you enough
for your generosity, Emekwi.

184
00:15:38.203 --> 00:15:40.913
Oh, please, Father,
the building goes unused.

185
00:15:40.914 --> 00:15:44.708
And besides, it is nothing more than
our Lord and Savior would expect.

186
00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:47.920
If you need anything,
anything at all, just ask.

187
00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:51.173
I wish others of our
faith felt that way.

188
00:15:51.174 --> 00:15:54.885
Oh, but, of course, the town will
get the room back soon, since

189
00:15:54.886 --> 00:15:58.388
Since we have to build a proper school.
Oh, please, Father.

190
00:15:58.389 --> 00:16:02.851
Do not think me a doubting Thomas.

191
00:16:02.852 --> 00:16:05.213
But

192
00:16:07.148 --> 00:16:10.718
we may not need that
new school right away.

193
00:16:11.194 --> 00:16:12.945
Hello, Papa.

194
00:16:12.946 --> 00:16:15.239
Hello, Joseph.

195
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.442
Hello, Papa.
Hello, James.

196
00:16:19.077 --> 00:16:21.319
Well

197
00:16:21.496 --> 00:16:23.939
it's a beginning.

198
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:35.454
Call for the doctor.

199
00:16:37.095 --> 00:16:39.586
It is the heat.

200
00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:44.800
Pick him up. Let's take him down.
I'll get some water.

201
00:17:00.618 --> 00:17:03.820
Don't let him take it all at once.

202
00:17:07.125 --> 00:17:09.782
Our friend is back.

203
00:17:12.005 --> 00:17:13.630
Cheche.

204
00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:16.739
Come for food and water again.

205
00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:20.470
It must be even worse
for him in this heat.

206
00:17:20.471 --> 00:17:22.806
I'll try to get him into the tent.

207
00:17:22.807 --> 00:17:25.583
Do not let the men see that

208
00:17:29.647 --> 00:17:32.174
Don't be afraid.

209
00:18:12.857 --> 00:18:16.527
You got here quickly.
Your man made it sound urgent.

210
00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.028
Well, is it?

211
00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:21.198
Chuma, try to make him
comfortable in the back of my truck.

212
00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:23.725
He needs rest and rehydration.

213
00:18:29.332 --> 00:18:31.740
Heat stroke.

214
00:18:31.876 --> 00:18:35.629
You're working them too hard.
There's water in the tent if you'd like

215
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.287
I would. Thank you.

216
00:18:38.424 --> 00:18:41.051
We had another
visit from that boy today.

217
00:18:41.052 --> 00:18:43.262
Cheche?
Yes.

218
00:18:43.263 --> 00:18:45.055
Any luck?

219
00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:47.748
Couldn't even get close.

220
00:18:51.729 --> 00:18:55.566
I had to sedate him two weeks ago.

221
00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:59.469
Just to treat a beating
he took from a villager.

222
00:19:00.864 --> 00:19:03.574
Why don't they help him?

223
00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:06.516
They think he's cursed.

224
00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:09.062
What he needs is sustained treatment.

225
00:19:15.879 --> 00:19:17.462
Yes?

226
00:19:17.463 --> 00:19:19.824
Nothing.

227
00:20:50.932 --> 00:20:53.141
Early this year.

228
00:20:53.143 --> 00:20:56.214
Two of the cattle have
been killed already.

229
00:20:56.604 --> 00:20:58.856
Thank you, Chuma.

230
00:20:58.857 --> 00:21:02.178
I must keep you safe
for the lady doctor.

231
00:22:06.174 --> 00:22:08.202
Cheche.

232
00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:16.007
Cheche.

233
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:49.665
The sores were very infected.

234
00:22:49.884 --> 00:22:54.249
I've cleaned and dressed them.
There's no permanent damage.

235
00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:59.258
The leg and arm are
a different matter.

236
00:22:59.686 --> 00:23:02.924
Night, Mara.

237
00:23:06.484 --> 00:23:09.011
There's nothing you can do?

238
00:23:09.904 --> 00:23:12.347
Not for the arm.

239
00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.491
The leg

240
00:23:14.492 --> 00:23:18.328
The leg could be theoretical
Theoret

241
00:23:18.329 --> 00:23:21.248
Theoret
"Theoretically."

242
00:23:21.249 --> 00:23:24.626
Theoretically, the leg
could be re-broken

243
00:23:24.627 --> 00:23:27.629
and set properly by a
surgeon from Nairobi.

244
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.204
They fly from

245
00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:34.701
Do you think he'd allow it?

246
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:49.883
It was called Chelmno.

247
00:23:50.945 --> 00:23:55.856
That was the Polish name.
The Germans called it Kulmhof.

248
00:23:56.326 --> 00:24:02.067
I was in a processing center
for confiscated items.

249
00:24:03.458 --> 00:24:08.420
It's amazing what you're capable of
when your physical survival is at stake.

250
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:12.205
Things you think you
could never endure.

251
00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:16.621
Well, nobody knew back then.
Everybody We heard stories.

252
00:24:18.556 --> 00:24:21.961
I wish they could fix that generator.

253
00:24:22.393 --> 00:24:25.299
No one wanted to believe.

254
00:24:25.605 --> 00:24:27.231
Of course not.

255
00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:30.234
Who could believe such
things were happening?

256
00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:33.153
No one wanted to believe.

257
00:24:33.154 --> 00:24:38.942
It's so much easier to believe
evil is random or an ogre

258
00:24:38.993 --> 00:24:43.857
not that it's a human condition,
something everyone is capable of.

259
00:24:45.875 --> 00:24:50.905
I believed God let us decide
between good and evil.

260
00:24:51.798 --> 00:24:54.258
I chose good.

261
00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:56.370
Evil happened.

262
00:25:05.687 --> 00:25:08.260
Now you travel.

263
00:25:08.731 --> 00:25:11.554
What are you looking for?

264
00:25:12.193 --> 00:25:14.055
Nothing.

265
00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:21.146
Sometimes I think the best
view of God is from hell.

266
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.729
This boy here

267
00:25:27.458 --> 00:25:31.029
You brought something
out of that young man.

268
00:25:31.963 --> 00:25:35.090
God is in that boy
that doesn't speak.

269
00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:37.968
Until he tried to speak to you.

270
00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:40.958
He's an unfortunate.

271
00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:43.250
One of God's afflicted.

272
00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:48.052
I think what you're looking for,
Father Merrin

273
00:25:49.355 --> 00:25:51.964
is here.

274
00:28:07.994 --> 00:28:11.481
You have been very brave, Cheche.

275
00:28:11.831 --> 00:28:14.488
You're on the mend.

276
00:28:15.502 --> 00:28:17.909
There.

277
00:28:18.588 --> 00:28:21.161
Better, eh?

278
00:28:25.178 --> 00:28:27.221
Be

279
00:28:27.222 --> 00:28:28.722
Better.

280
00:28:28.723 --> 00:28:31.665
Yes. Better.

281
00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:39.066
Merrin was right about you, Cheche.

282
00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:41.427
I thought you'd run away.

283
00:28:43.363 --> 00:28:45.225
Cheche

284
00:28:45.281 --> 00:28:47.866
if Appa and I

285
00:28:47.867 --> 00:28:49.910
If we could make your leg better

286
00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.773
Better.

287
00:28:54.123 --> 00:28:56.697
would you want that?

288
00:28:59.754 --> 00:29:04.550
We'll have a great deal of news
for Appa, won't we?

289
00:29:04.551 --> 00:29:07.492
Merrin, it's magnificent.

290
00:29:10.139 --> 00:29:12.880
Wait till you get inside.

291
00:29:47.218 --> 00:29:49.720
The war in heaven.

292
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:52.294
St. Michael.

293
00:29:54.934 --> 00:29:57.591
It's so strange.

294
00:29:58.188 --> 00:30:00.689
Churches were built to honor God

295
00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.715
provide a house of
worship, but this

296
00:30:04.694 --> 00:30:08.015
This can't have been a meeting place.

297
00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:10.767
No.

298
00:30:11.493 --> 00:30:14.268
This had to have another purpose.

299
00:30:16.206 --> 00:30:17.998
Merrin.

300
00:30:17.999 --> 00:30:20.656
Look at the figures.

301
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:25.214
Yes.

302
00:30:25.215 --> 00:30:28.091
Church architecture is supposed
to reach for the heavens.

303
00:30:28.092 --> 00:30:31.627
But this looks as if
As if it were holding something down.

304
00:30:33.181 --> 00:30:35.790
These rocks.

305
00:30:35.809 --> 00:30:38.964
These rocks are like plugs.

306
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:45.348
What is that?

307
00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:49.719
Like a sarcophagus.

308
00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:25.343
Shh.

309
00:31:26.401 --> 00:31:28.643
What?

310
00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:47.365
You hear that?
Yes.

311
00:31:59.767 --> 00:32:01.685
Chuma.

312
00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:04.925
Bring me some men and the shear legs.

313
00:32:16.201 --> 00:32:18.608
What is it?

314
00:32:18.828 --> 00:32:21.568
What are you frightened of?

315
00:33:25.478 --> 00:33:28.503
It's a temple of some kind.

316
00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:34.467
What idol could inspire
a place like this?

317
00:33:43.621 --> 00:33:45.733
I'd say it's dedicated to him.

318
00:33:50.753 --> 00:33:53.494
Some pagan god of these parts.

319
00:33:53.506 --> 00:33:55.632
Chuma?

320
00:33:55.633 --> 00:33:58.260
The old people would
sometimes tell stories

321
00:33:58.261 --> 00:34:00.971
of mountain demons
to scare us, but

322
00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:04.141
They built the church on top of this.

323
00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:08.175
That's why they buried it.
To hold this down.

324
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.933
They used St. Michael to emphasize that
the old gods had no power before the one.

325
00:34:15.028 --> 00:34:18.017
But I never believed.

326
00:34:22.118 --> 00:34:24.941
These are bloodstains.

327
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.668
People were sacrificed here.
Yeah.

328
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:35.537
It's almost like a scene out
of the Inquisition, isn't it?

329
00:35:08.623 --> 00:35:12.526
The hyenas must have
attacked the cattle.

330
00:35:12.752 --> 00:35:16.662
But the cattle killed them.

331
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.247
Then ate them.

332
00:35:20.802 --> 00:35:23.494
And now they die of it.

333
00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:35.755
He wants you to stop digging.

334
00:35:36.151 --> 00:35:38.511
He thinks the church is evil.

335
00:35:50.957 --> 00:35:54.877
His side of the family
either old ways or nothing.

336
00:35:54.878 --> 00:35:56.740
No argument.

337
00:36:13.062 --> 00:36:14.855
Look here.

338
00:36:14.856 --> 00:36:17.399
Look how it was done.

339
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:22.613
The workers who did this were not just
Not just workers. They were artists.

340
00:36:22.614 --> 00:36:25.073
The mosaics came
from across the world.

341
00:36:25.074 --> 00:36:29.143
Here. The great battle of the angels.

342
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.998
The turquoise from Egypt,
malachite from Namibia

343
00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:35.918
lapis from Afghanistan.

344
00:36:35.919 --> 00:36:38.825
Extraordinary.

345
00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:43.876
This is St. Michael.
It's his church. It's dedicated to him.

346
00:36:44.052 --> 00:36:46.887
But the violence.
It's the war of heaven.

347
00:36:46.888 --> 00:36:50.624
God's angels fighting
Satan and his legion

348
00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:54.083
cast into the underworld.

349
00:36:54.354 --> 00:36:57.814
It's the sort of
find that makes a career.

350
00:36:57.816 --> 00:37:01.683
I thought that
at first, but now it seems

351
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.779
There is he.

352
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.032
Lucifer, source of light.

353
00:37:07.033 --> 00:37:10.687
He was called the most
perfect of angels.

354
00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:16.625
It will make you, Lankester.

355
00:37:16.626 --> 00:37:19.698
But what will it make you?

356
00:37:19.796 --> 00:37:22.951
You're trying to see through me.

357
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.884
Are you a head doctor as well?

358
00:37:25.885 --> 00:37:28.971
It doesn't take an
expert to see you're suffering.

359
00:37:28.972 --> 00:37:31.473
You're in guilt.

360
00:37:31.474 --> 00:37:34.131
We're all in guilt.

361
00:37:34.686 --> 00:37:37.129
What I told you the other night

362
00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:40.065
I never told anyone else.

363
00:37:40.066 --> 00:37:44.218
I told you because of
something I saw in you.

364
00:37:54.664 --> 00:37:56.988
Merrin.

365
00:37:59.002 --> 00:38:02.786
I've got to inform Cardinal Jenkins.

366
00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:07.801
I hope you understand that if word
gets out about what's in there

367
00:38:07.802 --> 00:38:11.138
the danger of violation and looting
Which is why we have

368
00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:13.098
to inform Major Granville as well.

369
00:38:13.099 --> 00:38:16.301
Ask him to send a
detachment of guards.

370
00:38:16.311 --> 00:38:19.563
Because the British have
proved so trustworthy.

371
00:38:19.564 --> 00:38:21.481
Suppose you haven't seen
the British Museum?

372
00:38:21.483 --> 00:38:23.692
Everything in it was looted
from sites like that.

373
00:38:23.693 --> 00:38:26.266
Merrin, please.

374
00:38:26.905 --> 00:38:29.396
You're not the only one involved.

375
00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.761
Get on, boys.

376
00:38:50.762 --> 00:38:55.307
All right,
come on! Come on! Out, out!

377
00:38:55.308 --> 00:38:58.101
Welcome, major. Welcome to Derati.

378
00:38:58.102 --> 00:39:01.104
Fall in on the left,
promptly on the right.

379
00:39:01.105 --> 00:39:05.886
Fall in and stand easy!

380
00:39:05.944 --> 00:39:10.223
Good morning.

381
00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:14.284
Beloved wherever we go.
Sir.

382
00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:17.037
Sergeant major, have the
men stand to attention.

383
00:39:17.038 --> 00:39:20.624
I have a feeling those good women
report to the local aristocracy.

384
00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:24.086
And I don't want to display
even a hint of disrespect

385
00:39:24.087 --> 00:39:27.756
now or at any other time. Am I clear?
Yes, sir.

386
00:39:27.757 --> 00:39:30.968
Respect for the godforsaken
fuzzies at all times, sir.

387
00:39:30.969 --> 00:39:33.220
That is precisely the
sort of comment

388
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:34.721
Squad!

389
00:39:34.722 --> 00:39:37.331
Squad, attention!

390
00:39:38.268 --> 00:39:41.339
Men standing to attention, sir.
Thank you.

391
00:39:48.361 --> 00:39:51.864
Mix it with blood
or water. It's for pain.

392
00:39:58.121 --> 00:40:01.874
Sebituana's wife has gone into labor.
She's in a great deal of pain.

393
00:40:01.875 --> 00:40:04.251
This is Dr. Lamu.
Oh, doctor.

394
00:40:04.252 --> 00:40:06.795
Joseph Lamu.
Rachel Lesno.

395
00:40:06.796 --> 00:40:09.798
So good of you to come.
Not a problem.

396
00:40:09.799 --> 00:40:12.092
I told them to bring her here, but

397
00:40:12.093 --> 00:40:14.702
So I've sent some morphine.

398
00:40:22.937 --> 00:40:24.688
Do you think they count them?

399
00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:26.106
Hm?

400
00:40:26.107 --> 00:40:28.384
Do you think they count
them every night?

401
00:40:28.693 --> 00:40:31.653
Might do.
Might do.

402
00:40:31.654 --> 00:40:34.156
You got no more sense
than the fuzzies, corporal.

403
00:40:34.157 --> 00:40:35.824
Here.

404
00:40:35.825 --> 00:40:38.285
Respect the stripes, boy.

405
00:40:38.286 --> 00:40:40.704
Oh, "respect the stripes" now, is it?

406
00:40:40.705 --> 00:40:43.248
I tell you, they got
thousands of the things.

407
00:40:43.249 --> 00:40:46.418
Just a handful would make us
rich for the rest of our lives.

408
00:40:46.419 --> 00:40:49.444
Or get us hung.
Yeah?

409
00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:52.916
Well, they can't hang us for
having a look, now, can they?

410
00:41:31.714 --> 00:41:33.674
His wounds are healing well.

411
00:41:33.675 --> 00:41:35.592
I hope we do as well with this.

412
00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:37.752
He's young.

413
00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:40.207
His bones are strong.

414
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:10.419
Jesus Christ!

415
00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.462
Hundreds of them.

416
00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:15.535
Every kind of precious stone.

417
00:42:16.176 --> 00:42:19.794
Just a handful is all I need.

418
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.515
All we need, private.

419
00:42:23.516 --> 00:42:26.226
We pool the take. Yeah?

420
00:42:26.227 --> 00:42:28.339
Yeah.

421
00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:02.014
Cover them.

422
00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:08.729
Sorry, sir?
They're British soldiers.

423
00:44:09.038 --> 00:44:11.647
I won't have them left like that.

424
00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:16.242
Of course, sir.

425
00:44:16.296 --> 00:44:18.171
Richardson. Avery.

426
00:44:18.173 --> 00:44:21.577
Get some blankets and
cover those soldiers.

427
00:44:44.574 --> 00:44:46.867
You will keep me
informed about Cheche?

428
00:44:46.868 --> 00:44:49.276
Yes, of course.

429
00:44:51.581 --> 00:44:53.905
Merrin.

430
00:44:54.459 --> 00:44:56.653
Merrin.

431
00:44:56.961 --> 00:45:00.995
What's going on here?
What do you mean?

432
00:45:01.132 --> 00:45:03.300
What's going on here?

433
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:05.993
This whole valley.

434
00:45:12.268 --> 00:45:15.270
Why don't you stay a couple of days.

435
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:19.441
You hardly had any rest. I'll show
you the dig, the church we found.

436
00:45:19.442 --> 00:45:21.351
Who's in charge here?

437
00:45:21.694 --> 00:45:24.470
Military. Major Granville.

438
00:45:24.531 --> 00:45:28.325
Not you?
No.

439
00:45:28.326 --> 00:45:30.319
No, not me.

440
00:45:39.712 --> 00:45:43.947
You take care of yourself,
Lankester Merrin.

441
00:45:45.677 --> 00:45:47.302
Yes.

442
00:45:47.303 --> 00:45:49.462
Thank you.

443
00:46:33.224 --> 00:46:35.418
Who, Merrin?

444
00:46:35.768 --> 00:46:37.728
Why?

445
00:46:37.729 --> 00:46:40.355
Well, these were on the ground.

446
00:46:40.356 --> 00:46:43.677
They'd been pried out of the mosaics.

447
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:49.473
Maybe they were trying
to stop a robbery.

448
00:46:49.491 --> 00:46:53.025
Got killed by the thieves.
Of course.

449
00:46:54.913 --> 00:46:56.914
Bloody savages.
No.

450
00:46:56.915 --> 00:46:59.750
There's no reason to suspect
the Turkana, major.

451
00:46:59.751 --> 00:47:03.570
What?
The style of the killings

452
00:47:03.796 --> 00:47:07.758
the positioning of the bodies.
He's right.

453
00:47:07.759 --> 00:47:10.427
It's Christian imagery, not pagan.

454
00:47:10.428 --> 00:47:12.304
John the Baptist, head on a platter.

455
00:47:12.305 --> 00:47:15.390
Peter the Apostle crucified
A Christian is responsible?

456
00:47:15.391 --> 00:47:17.601
You're both insane.

457
00:47:17.602 --> 00:47:19.436
Merrin.

458
00:47:19.437 --> 00:47:22.773
Chuma, get that man out of here.

459
00:47:22.774 --> 00:47:24.885
Jomo saw what happened, major.

460
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.972
Did he?

461
00:47:33.451 --> 00:47:37.496
And what was it this
Jomo saw precisely?

462
00:47:37.497 --> 00:47:40.707
Jomo watches from the hills
that lie above this place, and

463
00:47:40.708 --> 00:47:44.113
And?
He says

464
00:47:45.296 --> 00:47:48.131
He says he saw the
two soldiers argue.

465
00:47:48.132 --> 00:47:51.301
One killed the other and
then stabbed himself.

466
00:47:51.302 --> 00:47:52.803
What the devil are you saying?

467
00:47:54.222 --> 00:47:57.933
They were stealing jewels. Then some
sort of madness overtook them

468
00:47:57.934 --> 00:48:00.923
Be quiet! I won't hear another word!

469
00:48:08.945 --> 00:48:11.637
That is the most

470
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:15.367
Tell this man that if he repeats
such absurdities, I'll arrest him.

471
00:48:15.368 --> 00:48:18.475
Yes
And you as well, do you understand?

472
00:48:23.626 --> 00:48:26.283
The idea's absurd.

473
00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:30.340
I'm supposed to accept
this was some sort of

474
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:34.219
acrobatic ritual murder and suicide?

475
00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.973
It's not only absurd, it's an insult.
Those men were with me for years.

476
00:48:37.974 --> 00:48:42.208
Major, please, please try
I don't need opinions, Merrin.

477
00:48:43.396 --> 00:48:46.690
I've been lenient with
you people, Chuma

478
00:48:46.691 --> 00:48:48.901
but warn the elders

479
00:48:48.902 --> 00:48:51.987
that unless they hand over
the men that did this

480
00:48:51.988 --> 00:48:56.732
life in these parts will become
distinctly less pleasant.

481
00:49:02.707 --> 00:49:05.732
I will get to the bottom of this.

482
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.547
Major, please.

483
00:49:10.548 --> 00:49:14.617
Do not choose the wrong
side in this, Merrin.

484
00:49:18.014 --> 00:49:20.557
Remember what you owe

485
00:49:20.558 --> 00:49:22.836
to whom.

486
00:49:23.603 --> 00:49:26.313
The wrong side, major?

487
00:49:26.314 --> 00:49:28.556
This is not war.

488
00:49:56.636 --> 00:49:58.804
Hello, Rachel.

489
00:49:58.805 --> 00:50:02.755
Is he all right?
Take a look.

490
00:50:04.811 --> 00:50:07.966
He started to run a fever
early this morning.

491
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:11.845
And there was a warmth
radiating from the cast.

492
00:50:12.277 --> 00:50:15.811
I took it off,
expecting to find gangrene.

493
00:50:16.281 --> 00:50:19.519
You can imagine my shock.

494
00:50:20.118 --> 00:50:24.946
So it's better.
It's on its way to being healed.

495
00:50:25.957 --> 00:50:29.877
This should have taken weeks

496
00:50:29.878 --> 00:50:32.404
not days.

497
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.282
And the fever's dropping.

498
00:50:40.555 --> 00:50:43.128
I only hope that

499
00:50:44.642 --> 00:50:46.717
Hope what?

500
00:50:47.979 --> 00:50:52.774
There are cases of false recovery

501
00:50:52.775 --> 00:50:56.653
of a body's system
appearing to improve

502
00:50:56.654 --> 00:51:00.972
but it's actually evidence
of a deeper problem.

503
00:51:02.827 --> 00:51:05.852
Any reason to believe
that's the case?

504
00:51:09.417 --> 00:51:11.418
No.

505
00:51:11.419 --> 00:51:13.837
No, there isn't.

506
00:51:13.838 --> 00:51:18.175
So many terrible things have
happened in the last few days

507
00:51:18.176 --> 00:51:21.830
you just can't see a good
thing for what it is.

508
00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:28.338
I'm just glad there is
something to be grateful for.

509
00:51:29.479 --> 00:51:34.342
This village has been on
the verge of an explosion.

510
00:51:34.692 --> 00:51:37.694
I don't know who's more
likely to ignite it

511
00:51:37.695 --> 00:51:40.292
Granville or the Turkana.

512
00:51:42.242 --> 00:51:44.768
Mara quit.

513
00:51:44.869 --> 00:51:46.370
Oh?

514
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:48.956
The elders told her not to work here.

515
00:51:48.957 --> 00:51:51.333
Because of the baby?

516
00:51:51.334 --> 00:51:53.460
That's part of it.

517
00:52:39.757 --> 00:52:41.951
What's happening?

518
00:52:50.059 --> 00:52:52.102
I suppose you've all
had a good laugh

519
00:52:52.103 --> 00:52:55.923
thinking what fools you've
made of the British Empire.

520
00:52:56.733 --> 00:52:59.639
But you've fooled no one.

521
00:52:59.903 --> 00:53:02.321
I told you I'd get to
the bottom of this.

522
00:53:02.322 --> 00:53:05.180
Major, please stop this.
You don't understand.

523
00:53:05.742 --> 00:53:08.315
Sergeant major!

524
00:53:08.953 --> 00:53:12.122
Sir.
I want these people kept at a distance.

525
00:53:12.123 --> 00:53:14.791
If they attempt to interfere,
they're to be arrested.

526
00:53:14.792 --> 00:53:17.034
And if they resist, shoot them.

527
00:53:17.295 --> 00:53:19.204
Sir?
Do it!

528
00:53:19.714 --> 00:53:21.576
Yes, sir!

529
00:53:21.633 --> 00:53:23.467
Not him.

530
00:53:23.468 --> 00:53:25.469
I'll need an interpreter.

531
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:28.013
And interpret carefully, Chuma.

532
00:53:28.014 --> 00:53:32.434
Tell them I have waited long enough
to find out who killed my men.

533
00:53:32.435 --> 00:53:35.604
This is a small town. One of them
must know who is responsible.

534
00:53:35.605 --> 00:53:39.441
I'll give them one more chance for that
person to reveal the murderer's name.

535
00:53:39.442 --> 00:53:43.475
Major!
Mind your own, priest.

536
00:53:45.907 --> 00:53:50.160
Sebituana says that everybody knows
that your men killed each other.

537
00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:54.064
They were stealing and they went mad
Shut your mouth!

538
00:53:54.958 --> 00:53:57.459
You think you're the
law here, do you?

539
00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.129
You go on hiding your murderers
because you don't fear me yet.

540
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:04.007
Well, my friend, let me assure you
Major, stop this!

541
00:54:04.008 --> 00:54:09.536
If a reason for fear is what
you need, then I can oblige!

542
00:54:18.982 --> 00:54:21.223
Hold that man!

543
00:54:34.205 --> 00:54:36.123
Corporal Williams.
Sergeant major.

544
00:54:36.124 --> 00:54:40.210
Have the men stand down and fall in by
the lorry. Allow the natives to tidy up.

545
00:54:40.211 --> 00:54:41.420
Move it!

546
00:54:41.421 --> 00:54:43.505
Private Evans!
Places on the guard wall!

547
00:54:43.506 --> 00:54:46.448
Places on the guard wall!

548
00:54:48.052 --> 00:54:51.706
Sir. To the car, sir.

549
00:55:02.358 --> 00:55:06.344
Left, right,
left, right, left, right

550
00:55:24.839 --> 00:55:27.615
I'm sorry I startled you.

551
00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:35.132
Did you manage to sleep
through the night?

552
00:55:37.101 --> 00:55:39.343
Yes.

553
00:55:42.357 --> 00:55:45.678
I wish I could say
the same for Rachel.

554
00:55:46.277 --> 00:55:49.646
She woke several times
after you left.

555
00:55:58.414 --> 00:56:01.949
Seemed afraid something
might happen to the boy.

556
00:56:02.794 --> 00:56:06.993
She finally calmed down when
I said I'd watch over him.

557
00:56:07.757 --> 00:56:09.951
Which seemed the least I could do.

558
00:56:10.468 --> 00:56:13.623
Don't.
Don't what?

559
00:56:14.013 --> 00:56:18.592
Don't acknowledge the fact that I was
the one that asked Granville to come?

560
00:56:19.477 --> 00:56:21.728
You didn't ask him to shoot the girl.

561
00:56:21.729 --> 00:56:25.315
There's only one person
responsible for what happened.

562
00:56:25.316 --> 00:56:27.510
How is he?

563
00:56:30.446 --> 00:56:33.055
He seems fine.

564
00:56:33.283 --> 00:56:34.783
Um

565
00:56:34.784 --> 00:56:36.660
I'll take over.

566
00:56:36.661 --> 00:56:39.318
You've got things to do.

567
00:56:47.839 --> 00:56:50.531
Not much, I'm afraid.

568
00:56:51.217 --> 00:56:53.927
I doubt there'll be much of a class.

569
00:56:53.928 --> 00:56:58.293
Well, the children seem to
genuinely like school and you.

570
00:56:58.683 --> 00:57:01.755
I'm sure some of them will turn up.

571
00:57:01.769 --> 00:57:04.462
Are you all right, Merrin?

572
00:57:06.065 --> 00:57:08.307
Is it cold in here?

573
00:57:24.501 --> 00:57:26.501
Prayer, Merrin.

574
00:57:26.503 --> 00:57:29.379
It's all we have at times like these.

575
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.290
Yeah.

576
00:57:33.801 --> 00:57:36.624
It's like having nothing, isn't it?

577
00:57:44.729 --> 00:57:47.006
Lankester.

578
00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:55.678
May I speak to you
at a personal level?

579
00:57:56.407 --> 00:57:58.768
Of course.

580
00:57:58.952 --> 00:58:01.027
Christian to Christian?

581
00:58:06.668 --> 00:58:10.754
"Evil may gain sway over
our lives for a time

582
00:58:10.755 --> 00:58:12.798
but the ultimate power of faith

583
00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:15.801
lies in its ability
to strengthen men.

584
00:58:15.802 --> 00:58:19.263
Not to conquer evil,
but to survive it."

585
00:58:19.264 --> 00:58:21.457
You wrote that. I read it.

586
00:58:22.475 --> 00:58:25.227
A young man's theories.

587
00:58:25.228 --> 00:58:27.771
But you proved it.

588
00:58:27.772 --> 00:58:30.974
I survived, if that's what you mean.

589
00:58:31.025 --> 00:58:33.193
But did I live?

590
00:58:33.194 --> 00:58:35.269
Not really.

591
00:58:35.363 --> 00:58:38.684
He didn't force you
to wander from him.

592
00:58:39.159 --> 00:58:41.368
He allowed you to

593
00:58:41.369 --> 00:58:43.646
out of love.

594
00:58:44.247 --> 00:58:47.291
And if you find now that you're
lost, you must have faith

595
00:58:47.292 --> 00:58:50.377
that his love will guide you back.

596
00:58:50.378 --> 00:58:53.236
All you have to do is ask.

597
00:58:57.719 --> 00:59:00.660
You mean well,
but you can't see my soul.

598
00:59:02.891 --> 00:59:06.675
I'm God's servant. He can.

599
00:59:30.877 --> 00:59:32.586
Well

600
00:59:32.587 --> 00:59:36.298
I didn't think I would see
so many of you today.

601
00:59:36.299 --> 00:59:40.052
When you go home, you must
remember to thank your families.

602
00:59:40.053 --> 00:59:41.762
Their families not know, Father.

603
00:59:41.763 --> 00:59:44.097
Their parents tell them
they must not come.

604
00:59:44.098 --> 00:59:47.206
They say that Jesus
Christ killed Falashadey.

605
00:59:48.812 --> 00:59:51.836
Falashadey, that was her name?

606
00:59:52.106 --> 00:59:55.734
They come to school because
they think if they do not come

607
00:59:55.735 --> 00:59:59.305
maybe Jesus Christ
might kill them too.

608
01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:04.809
Joseph, James, come here.

609
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:12.709
Jesus Christ did not
kill that young woman.

610
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:15.045
The British major did.

611
01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:17.786
And it was very, very wrong.

612
01:00:20.969 --> 01:00:24.124
Jomo, no. You must not.

613
01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:56.420
Anderson, get some
medical help in here.

614
01:00:56.421 --> 01:00:57.921
Joseph!

615
01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.248
My son.

616
01:01:13.813 --> 01:01:15.758
What did he say?

617
01:01:17.984 --> 01:01:20.819
What did he say?
He said

618
01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.933
that he had to kill them to stop
the Christian evil from spreading.

619
01:01:27.952 --> 01:01:30.313
This, Father?

620
01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:36.210
Is this how the Almighty treats those
who have kept faith with him?

621
01:01:36.211 --> 01:01:38.073
Yes.

622
01:01:49.724 --> 01:01:51.586
No.

623
01:02:18.795 --> 01:02:21.129
Father. Father Francis.

624
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:23.423
What is it? What's happened?

625
01:02:23.424 --> 01:02:26.663
I think you'd better
see for yourself.

626
01:02:31.975 --> 01:02:34.382
My God.

627
01:02:34.519 --> 01:02:37.813
How did you?
I didn't.

628
01:02:37.814 --> 01:02:40.175
Not intentionally.

629
01:02:40.733 --> 01:02:44.767
This may be more your
province than mine, Father.

630
01:02:45.488 --> 01:02:47.350
It's a miracle.

631
01:02:53.788 --> 01:02:56.397
I have to get Merrin.

632
01:02:57.834 --> 01:03:00.325
Will you be all right?

633
01:03:00.461 --> 01:03:02.324
Yes.

634
01:03:32.076 --> 01:03:33.952
Maybe you

635
01:03:33.953 --> 01:03:38.069
are the one proof of
God in this terrible place.

636
01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.624
Because you're certainly
the only innocent creature.

637
01:04:17.956 --> 01:04:20.648
You know my guilt?

638
01:04:33.972 --> 01:04:36.213
The spirit of our Savior.

639
01:04:36.933 --> 01:04:38.842
It's in you.

640
01:04:40.019 --> 01:04:43.388
And it will point the way
out of this darkness.

641
01:04:45.859 --> 01:04:48.136
O Lord

642
01:04:48.945 --> 01:04:51.269
Lord, I pray thee

643
01:04:51.823 --> 01:04:54.599
hear my voice as I have heard thine.

644
01:04:55.451 --> 01:04:59.853
Let this blessed child continue
to be thy messenger

645
01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:05.407
that we may know thy will

646
01:05:07.672 --> 01:05:10.163
and thy wisdom.

647
01:05:15.722 --> 01:05:21.167
In the name of the Father,
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

648
01:05:38.161 --> 01:05:40.438
God bless this child.

649
01:05:46.336 --> 01:05:50.330
Don't ever
touch me with that again, priest!

650
01:06:27.794 --> 01:06:30.700
My God.

651
01:06:50.358 --> 01:06:52.801
The boy must be baptized.

652
01:06:56.281 --> 01:06:59.283
You're still recovering from
that blow to the head, Father.

653
01:06:59.284 --> 01:07:02.369
That's an awfully weak attempt
to explain this away.

654
01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:04.079
Yes, it is.

655
01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.956
Then you accept it?

656
01:07:05.957 --> 01:07:09.042
An evil spirit at work in this town?
I didn't say that.

657
01:07:09.043 --> 01:07:10.669
Things you think you heard

658
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:13.881
things you think you saw
You're saying I'm hallucinating.

659
01:07:13.882 --> 01:07:16.717
What about the burn on his forehead?
Did I imagine that?

660
01:07:16.718 --> 01:07:19.094
It's an injury in the
rough shape of a cross.

661
01:07:19.095 --> 01:07:20.762
The rough shape.

662
01:07:20.763 --> 01:07:23.932
You've had a nervous breakdown
Breakdown?!

663
01:07:23.933 --> 01:07:26.810
Oh, I think it's you who have
been through too much, Merrin.

664
01:07:26.811 --> 01:07:30.105
Will you please try to
control yourselves?

665
01:07:30.106 --> 01:07:32.357
The boy needs rest.

666
01:07:32.358 --> 01:07:34.552
And what about his perfect English?

667
01:07:35.278 --> 01:07:38.813
Oh, of course, I must
be imagining that too.

668
01:07:41.201 --> 01:07:43.229
All right.

669
01:07:43.661 --> 01:07:46.455
Let's assume what you say is true.

670
01:07:46.456 --> 01:07:48.832
What harm could there
be in his being baptized?

671
01:07:48.833 --> 01:07:52.502
A great deal. Those people
hate and fear Cheche.

672
01:07:52.504 --> 01:07:54.713
You want to expose him
to further danger

673
01:07:54.714 --> 01:07:57.507
by having him join a religion
they equate with evil?

674
01:07:57.509 --> 01:08:00.344
Say it. Say it, Merrin. Or can't you?

675
01:08:00.345 --> 01:08:03.055
The work of Satan.
It's the work of man!

676
01:08:03.056 --> 01:08:05.849
Why can't you accept that?
Because my only concern

677
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:09.255
is the eternal soul
of that young man.

678
01:08:11.397 --> 01:08:14.066
Are you so arrogant, Merrin

679
01:08:14.067 --> 01:08:17.945
that you would involve the rest of
the world in your crisis of faith?

680
01:08:17.946 --> 01:08:21.365
That you would deny to someone
what you once cherished

681
01:08:21.366 --> 01:08:24.521
simply because you now doubt it?

682
01:08:27.539 --> 01:08:31.654
What makes you think he wants it?
You could try asking him.

683
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:34.950
He's awake now.

684
01:08:56.484 --> 01:08:58.596
See.

685
01:09:00.822 --> 01:09:04.074
Doctor, please, would you ask
him if he would like to become

686
01:09:04.075 --> 01:09:06.743
a Christian like Appa and myself?

687
01:09:06.744 --> 01:09:08.453
Unless you object.

688
01:09:08.454 --> 01:09:10.414
Cheche.

689
01:09:23.595 --> 01:09:26.763
He would like it.
Good.

690
01:09:26.764 --> 01:09:30.418
Good, Cheche. Good.
He wants to do it in the church.

691
01:09:31.603 --> 01:09:34.628
He seems to think
that's where you live.

692
01:09:35.607 --> 01:09:38.692
He wants to be as much
like you as he can.

693
01:09:38.693 --> 01:09:42.429
Unless you want to explain
your misgivings to him.

694
01:09:44.324 --> 01:09:47.977
There's a beautiful baptismal
font in the church.

695
01:09:48.453 --> 01:09:50.979
We could use that.

696
01:10:30.829 --> 01:10:33.106
Major Granville.

697
01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.291
Major Granville, sir.

698
01:10:53.268 --> 01:10:55.592
Sir, are you?

699
01:10:56.604 --> 01:10:58.605
Are you all right, sir?

700
01:10:58.606 --> 01:11:01.464
All right.

701
01:11:07.323 --> 01:11:10.562
I shall be down in a moment.

702
01:11:12.203 --> 01:11:14.112
Sir.

703
01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.898
Oh, and sergeant major.

704
01:11:18.918 --> 01:11:20.544
Sir?

705
01:11:20.545 --> 01:11:23.949
I shall need you to give
Mr. Merrin a message.

706
01:11:24.757 --> 01:11:26.999
Tell him

707
01:11:28.678 --> 01:11:33.079
Tell him I know now how it's
been for him all these years.

708
01:11:33.308 --> 01:11:37.127
But tell him there's no way out.

709
01:11:39.272 --> 01:11:41.596
Other than

710
01:11:43.276 --> 01:11:45.185
Sir!

711
01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:02.586
I just need one or two more
things from the hotel, doctor.

712
01:12:02.587 --> 01:12:05.694
I'll have him ready, Father.
Thank you.

713
01:12:33.785 --> 01:12:36.228
Don't bother, doctor.

714
01:12:36.287 --> 01:12:39.988
He asked me to give you a message
before he'd shot himself.

715
01:12:45.588 --> 01:12:47.965
Said he understood what
you were going through.

716
01:12:47.966 --> 01:12:51.121
And that this was the only way out.
Any idea what he meant?

717
01:12:53.096 --> 01:12:54.958
No.

718
01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.724
He never meant to kill that girl.

719
01:12:57.725 --> 01:13:01.177
That went against every
part of the major's nature.

720
01:13:01.312 --> 01:13:03.175
Something got into him.

721
01:13:04.315 --> 01:13:07.934
Mr. Merrin, sir

722
01:13:09.821 --> 01:13:12.322
some of the boys, they

723
01:13:12.323 --> 01:13:16.326
They're not too happy.
The major was well liked.

724
01:13:16.327 --> 01:13:19.913
So if you have any pull
with the spearchuckers

725
01:13:19.914 --> 01:13:22.986
I'd advise them to step quietly.

726
01:13:24.002 --> 01:13:28.366
I'll do what I can.
Thank you, sergeant major.

727
01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.582
Carry on.

728
01:15:37.093 --> 01:15:39.344
What do you make
of that, sergeant major?

729
01:15:39.345 --> 01:15:40.971
I don't know.

730
01:15:40.972 --> 01:15:43.083
But get on the radio to town.

731
01:15:43.808 --> 01:15:47.462
I want all available men
up here on the double.

732
01:15:47.937 --> 01:15:50.179
Come on.

733
01:15:53.151 --> 01:15:56.028
Okay. We're gonna go down.

734
01:15:56.029 --> 01:15:57.988
Just like that.

735
01:15:57.989 --> 01:16:00.397
That's perfect.

736
01:16:28.853 --> 01:16:30.715
Open the gate!

737
01:16:52.502 --> 01:16:56.120
What is it?
It's music for battle.

738
01:17:25.076 --> 01:17:27.104
Father.

739
01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.845
Cheche.

740
01:17:44.846 --> 01:17:47.097
His fever's come back.
Quickly, doctor.

741
01:17:47.098 --> 01:17:49.600
But
Please, this is no miracle.

742
01:17:49.601 --> 01:17:51.393
Help me.

743
01:17:51.394 --> 01:17:54.336
Hold the child's head over the font.

744
01:18:34.813 --> 01:18:37.920
Ah!

745
01:18:45.824 --> 01:18:50.536
I warned you about that, priest!

746
01:18:58.503 --> 01:19:00.864
It is Sebituana.

747
01:19:01.548 --> 01:19:04.786
He wants to talk to the
British commander.

748
01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:07.010
Some sort of trick, then?

749
01:19:07.011 --> 01:19:09.638
I'll go.
No.

750
01:19:09.639 --> 01:19:11.963
We'll go.

751
01:19:11.975 --> 01:19:14.977
Corporal Williams,
Private Standish, join us.

752
01:19:14.978 --> 01:19:17.634
Arms at the ready.

753
01:19:25.947 --> 01:19:28.574
Sebituana does not wish to fight.

754
01:19:28.575 --> 01:19:31.599
Well, they ain't dressed for
ballroom dancing, Chuma.

755
01:19:32.704 --> 01:19:34.746
What does he want, then?

756
01:19:38.376 --> 01:19:41.199
For the church to be
buried again. That, and

757
01:19:44.591 --> 01:19:49.253
He wants Father Francis. He says only he
brought the Christian evil and soldiers.

758
01:19:53.433 --> 01:19:56.727
He must die. So must the boy.

759
01:19:56.728 --> 01:20:00.314
Only Cheche has drawn strength
from all the evil that has happened.

760
01:20:03.234 --> 01:20:05.402
The British, if they leave now

761
01:20:05.403 --> 01:20:08.780
will be spared.
Right.

762
01:20:08.781 --> 01:20:13.827
You can tell Sebituana and his friends
to disperse quietly and go home

763
01:20:13.828 --> 01:20:17.446
and we'll be the ones
doing the sparing.

764
01:20:24.297 --> 01:20:27.090
If it's a fight they want

765
01:20:27.091 --> 01:20:30.163
it's a fight they're gonna get.

766
01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.315
You had no idea

767
01:20:43.316 --> 01:20:46.803
what you were toying with, did you?

768
01:20:54.452 --> 01:20:57.192
The book of rituals

769
01:20:57.455 --> 01:21:00.657
I have a copy.
I've got to get to town.

770
01:21:01.793 --> 01:21:05.280
This boy is possessed.

771
01:21:29.362 --> 01:21:33.680
Where's Rachel and Cheche?
Still inside.

772
01:21:33.908 --> 01:21:36.232
The boy is

773
01:21:36.244 --> 01:21:39.185
I must get the book of rituals.

774
01:21:41.708 --> 01:21:45.243
Satan is real.

775
01:22:08.985 --> 01:22:13.813
I am perfection.

776
01:22:39.057 --> 01:22:40.966
Francis!
No.

777
01:22:45.605 --> 01:22:47.231
It's too dangerous.

778
01:22:47.232 --> 01:22:50.234
I'm gonna maintain the
perimeter until daybreak.

779
01:22:50.235 --> 01:22:52.927
We'll look for the Father then.

780
01:22:53.321 --> 01:22:56.031
We have to clear those doors.
We have to get them out.

781
01:22:56.032 --> 01:22:59.733
I've got my men to think of right now.
They're trapped in there!

782
01:23:03.373 --> 01:23:08.919
We'll wait till the sun to come up.
Then we'll start moving the rubble.

783
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.244
All right, sir?

784
01:23:25.603 --> 01:23:29.106
Well, are they gone or not?
There is no way to know.

785
01:23:29.107 --> 01:23:32.359
Right, then. Corporal Williams,
send a detail of men

786
01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:36.405
to help Mr. Merrin clear that rubble.
Then I want you and another detail

787
01:23:36.406 --> 01:23:39.741
to go out there and see if
our friends are gone or not.

788
01:23:39.742 --> 01:23:42.452
And have a look for Father Francis.

789
01:23:42.453 --> 01:23:45.656
The rest of the squad's
to stay on the perimeter.

790
01:24:38.885 --> 01:24:43.997
How could you leave him like that?
We didn't know what to do, sir.

791
01:24:49.521 --> 01:24:52.806
Private Standish, cut him down.

792
01:24:55.026 --> 01:24:57.236
Father Merrin.
He's alive.

793
01:24:57.237 --> 01:24:59.571
Get a stretcher.
Do it!

794
01:24:59.572 --> 01:25:02.241
Chuma, get the nurse,
tell her to come to the clinic.

795
01:25:02.242 --> 01:25:04.910
Tell her she must come,
tell her it's Father Francis.

796
01:25:04.911 --> 01:25:08.362
It's him. It's him.

797
01:25:13.503 --> 01:25:15.128
It's him.

798
01:25:15.129 --> 01:25:17.589
You'll be fine. Give me a hand!

799
01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:25.253
It's him.

800
01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.400
Thank you for coming, Mara.

801
01:25:36.401 --> 01:25:39.686
I did it for Father Francis.

802
01:25:40.697 --> 01:25:43.603
Where is Miss Rachel?

803
01:25:43.658 --> 01:25:45.935
At the dig.

804
01:25:54.127 --> 01:25:57.827
Yes?
Unction, Father.

805
01:25:59.215 --> 01:26:02.259
I need the last rites.

806
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.802
No.

807
01:26:03.803 --> 01:26:06.555
You'll be all right.
My immortal

808
01:26:06.556 --> 01:26:08.765
My immortal soul

809
01:26:08.766 --> 01:26:12.502
is in danger. Please.

810
01:26:12.562 --> 01:26:15.302
Please, Merrin.

811
01:26:16.357 --> 01:26:18.400
Please get the kit.

812
01:26:18.401 --> 01:26:20.974
Please.

813
01:26:34.584 --> 01:26:38.617
You'll need the book
of Roman rituals.

814
01:26:38.713 --> 01:26:40.797
It's in my room.

815
01:26:40.798 --> 01:26:45.116
I haven't forgotten the last rites.
Not for that.

816
01:26:46.846 --> 01:26:49.306
You'll need it for the
rite of exorcism.

817
01:26:49.307 --> 01:26:51.642
You can't make that decision.

818
01:26:51.643 --> 01:26:56.007
The archbishop needs to be contacted.
There's no time.

819
01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:01.097
He's in the boy.

820
01:27:03.363 --> 01:27:07.728
Oh, God help us. He's in the boy.

821
01:27:10.662 --> 01:27:12.996
Any progress?
No.

822
01:27:12.997 --> 01:27:15.832
How's Father Francis?
He's resting.

823
01:27:15.834 --> 01:27:17.334
Savages.

824
01:27:17.335 --> 01:27:21.736
If they think they can get away with
this, they don't understand the British.

825
01:27:26.344 --> 01:27:28.337
Look out!

826
01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:44.220
Chuma, are you all right?

827
01:27:46.531 --> 01:27:48.892
Don't go in!

828
01:27:52.203 --> 01:27:56.402
Look after Chuma. Don't follow me.

829
01:28:01.212 --> 01:28:03.406
Rachel?

830
01:28:17.479 --> 01:28:19.720
Rachel?

831
01:28:48.092 --> 01:28:50.785
Is that you, Rachel?

832
01:29:17.664 --> 01:29:19.906
Rachel.

833
01:29:20.959 --> 01:29:23.034
Rachel.

834
01:29:23.044 --> 01:29:25.487
Rachel, wake up.

835
01:29:25.713 --> 01:29:28.131
Wake up, you're dreaming.

836
01:29:28.132 --> 01:29:30.092
Rachel.

837
01:29:30.093 --> 01:29:32.417
Wake up.

838
01:29:32.637 --> 01:29:35.662
Where's Cheche?
No.

839
01:29:36.808 --> 01:29:39.334
I was there.

840
01:29:39.853 --> 01:29:42.759
It was so real.

841
01:29:42.981 --> 01:29:45.816
Chelmno.
No, you were dreaming.

842
01:29:45.817 --> 01:29:48.652
You were dreaming. You are here.
I wanted to be

843
01:29:48.653 --> 01:29:52.656
I want to be back. He took me there.

844
01:29:52.657 --> 01:29:55.492
You were dreaming, that's all.
But I want to go back.

845
01:29:55.493 --> 01:29:58.161
You have to let me. It was
different, I was helping.

846
01:29:58.163 --> 01:30:00.873
You can go!
Rachel!

847
01:30:00.874 --> 01:30:03.067
I'm sorry.

848
01:30:04.294 --> 01:30:06.737
I'm sorry, Rachel.

849
01:30:08.464 --> 01:30:11.869
I'm sorry.
We can help each other.

850
01:30:14.345 --> 01:30:17.750
Only we can help each other.

851
01:30:19.184 --> 01:30:20.893
Rachel.

852
01:30:20.894 --> 01:30:24.215
We're the same, you and I.

853
01:30:30.278 --> 01:30:34.347
You're a passionate man, Merrin.

854
01:30:36.075 --> 01:30:39.065
Full of hunger.

855
01:30:50.882 --> 01:30:52.674
Get out.

856
01:30:52.675 --> 01:30:54.750
Now.

857
01:31:04.521 --> 01:31:06.964
You call me cruel.

858
01:31:07.148 --> 01:31:10.802
Rachel was rewriting her past.

859
01:31:11.569 --> 01:31:14.641
Then you destroyed it.

860
01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:17.149
You're the great deceiver.

861
01:31:24.415 --> 01:31:28.034
Did Father Francis mention me?

862
01:31:28.711 --> 01:31:30.823
He called you Satan.

863
01:31:32.507 --> 01:31:36.218
Did I not roll away
the stones for you?

864
01:31:36.219 --> 01:31:38.995
Why torment Rachel?

865
01:31:39.097 --> 01:31:41.837
She's not the one who sinned.

866
01:31:42.684 --> 01:31:46.171
She never helped another prisoner.

867
01:31:47.355 --> 01:31:50.724
She traded her body for food.

868
01:31:52.485 --> 01:31:55.142
She betrayed her friends.

869
01:31:55.363 --> 01:31:59.867
Liar!
You hate God, Merrin.

870
01:31:59.868 --> 01:32:04.482
And why not? God gives you guilt.

871
01:32:05.123 --> 01:32:07.649
The guilt is unbearable.

872
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:12.713
I do not curse God.

873
01:32:12.714 --> 01:32:14.576
But

874
01:32:17.594 --> 01:32:20.749
there is one thing you can do.

875
01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:25.675
You can cease to care.

876
01:32:27.562 --> 01:32:29.804
That is your offer?

877
01:32:29.981 --> 01:32:34.560
I offer freedom.

878
01:32:36.196 --> 01:32:38.280
Run.

879
01:32:38.281 --> 01:32:42.515
Run, Merrin, run.

880
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.822
You tried me, Lord.

881
01:32:48.249 --> 01:32:50.657
I failed.

882
01:32:51.628 --> 01:32:54.154
Forgive my disbelief.

883
01:32:55.507 --> 01:32:58.247
Help my disbelief.

884
01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:05.630
Take my disbelief into your
bosom and give me strength.

885
01:33:07.936 --> 01:33:11.554
Absolve my sins and purify me.

886
01:33:13.316 --> 01:33:16.388
Purify me for this task.

887
01:34:19.674 --> 01:34:24.537
Everything was good in Derati
until the missionary came.

888
01:34:26.097 --> 01:34:28.807
Jomo may have held the spear

889
01:34:28.808 --> 01:34:32.462
but Father Francis killed my son.

890
01:35:16.064 --> 01:35:19.468
Easy, boys.

891
01:35:19.776 --> 01:35:21.970
Let Mr. Merrin through.

892
01:35:28.576 --> 01:35:30.077
Or is it Father Merrin?

893
01:35:30.078 --> 01:35:32.704
Christ, have mercy on us.

894
01:35:32.705 --> 01:35:34.289
Lord, have mercy on us.

895
01:35:34.290 --> 01:35:37.626
Better not come out, priest,
if you know what's good for you.

896
01:35:37.627 --> 01:35:38.919
Christ, have mercy on us.

897
01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.671
Blood will flow tonight.

898
01:35:40.672 --> 01:35:42.965
Lord, have mercy on us.

899
01:37:13.765 --> 01:37:18.047
You think your uniform will save you?

900
01:37:26.945 --> 01:37:29.886
Lord, have mercy on us.

901
01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:33.062
Christ, hear us.

902
01:37:33.493 --> 01:37:38.773
God the Father of
heaven, have mercy on us.

903
01:37:38.998 --> 01:37:41.792
God, the Son
It's not working.

904
01:37:41.793 --> 01:37:45.912
Redeemer of the world
have mercy on us.

905
01:37:46.005 --> 01:37:48.966
Oh, God, the Holy Ghost,
have mercy on us.

906
01:37:48.967 --> 01:37:52.678
Holy Trinity, one God,
have mercy on us.

907
01:37:52.679 --> 01:37:55.086
You're a weak vessel.

908
01:38:12.824 --> 01:38:15.813
A weak vessel leaks.

909
01:38:17.203 --> 01:38:19.872
It is not only me who fights you.

910
01:38:19.873 --> 01:38:22.374
I'm not alone.

911
01:38:22.375 --> 01:38:25.043
All ye holy angels

912
01:38:25.044 --> 01:38:27.254

pray for us.

914
01:38:31.134 --> 01:38:36.664
All ye holy orders of blessed
spirits pray for us.

make intercession for us.

927
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:28.546
From thy wrath, O Lord, deliver us.

928
01:39:29.234 --> 01:39:32.402
From anger, hatred

929
01:39:32.403 --> 01:39:35.239
and ill will, O Lord, deliver us.

930
01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.771
From lightning and tempest
Don't you want to go back?

931
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:47.778
Yes.

932
01:39:47.794 --> 01:39:49.656
Go back.

933
01:39:50.713 --> 01:39:54.633
From pestilence, famine and war

934
01:39:54.634 --> 01:39:56.593
O Lord, deliver us.

935
01:39:56.594 --> 01:39:58.955
Go back.

936
01:40:01.015 --> 01:40:05.547
You can undo the events of that day.

937
01:40:06.104 --> 01:40:09.591
You can end your guilt.

938
01:40:21.119 --> 01:40:23.776
Go back.

939
01:40:27.667 --> 01:40:29.960
From everlasting death

940
01:40:29.961 --> 01:40:34.298
through his ho
Don't you want to go back?

941
01:40:34.299 --> 01:40:36.383
Through his

942
01:40:36.384 --> 01:40:40.500
Through his Through his ho

943
01:41:01.034 --> 01:41:03.109
You, priest.

944
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:07.607
What's your name?

945
01:41:09.042 --> 01:41:11.043
I'm Father Merrin.

946
01:41:11.044 --> 01:41:13.570
And these people confess to you?

947
01:41:14.005 --> 01:41:16.173
So point out the one
who's responsible.

948
01:41:16.174 --> 01:41:20.177
No one here did this, lieutenant.
They aren't capable of it.

949
01:41:20.178 --> 01:41:24.640
Did you hear what I said?
That God is not here today?

950
01:41:24.641 --> 01:41:26.882
Yes, I know that.

951
01:41:29.854 --> 01:41:32.773
I'm going to shoot 10 of you

952
01:41:32.774 --> 01:41:36.610
in the hope that we can
demonstrate to this wretch

953
01:41:36.611 --> 01:41:38.987
the terrible responsibility
he has incurred.

954
01:41:38.988 --> 01:41:40.851
Stop.

955
01:41:43.076 --> 01:41:45.982
You have some objection, Father?

956
01:41:46.871 --> 01:41:48.622
Shoot me.

957
01:41:48.623 --> 01:41:51.583
Yes, you'd like that.

958
01:41:51.584 --> 01:41:53.418
You choose.

959
01:41:53.419 --> 01:41:55.420
You have five seconds.

960
01:41:55.421 --> 01:41:57.965
I can't.
You can't what?

961
01:41:57.966 --> 01:42:00.217
Pick who will be sacrificed?

962
01:42:00.218 --> 01:42:03.539
History is full of priests
who did little else.

963
01:42:03.555 --> 01:42:07.707
Father Merrin. You begin
to irritate me, Father.

964
01:42:10.395 --> 01:42:15.258
Tell your men to lay down
their weapons and leave.

965
01:42:15.942 --> 01:42:19.228
Priest or no,
I swear I will kill you.

966
01:42:19.404 --> 01:42:22.531
You'll get what satisfaction
you want, priest

967
01:42:22.532 --> 01:42:27.110
because my men will not
lay down their weapons.

968
01:43:12.207 --> 01:43:14.650
Feel better?

969
01:43:15.585 --> 01:43:18.337
You did what you could.

970
01:43:18.338 --> 01:43:21.340
You laid down your life

971
01:43:21.341 --> 01:43:24.760
but God decided to kill them anyway.

972
01:43:24.761 --> 01:43:27.702
Your guilt is gone.

973
01:43:29.974 --> 01:43:32.631
You are free.

974
01:43:33.186 --> 01:43:35.510
Free?

975
01:43:36.356 --> 01:43:38.023
To cease to care?

976
01:43:38.024 --> 01:43:41.678
To walk this earth your own man

977
01:43:42.153 --> 01:43:45.322
without debt or guilt.

978
01:43:45.323 --> 01:43:48.158
This earth is not your dominion.

979
01:43:48.159 --> 01:43:51.729
Man is the chosen temple of God.

980
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:54.689
His holy vessel.

981
01:43:55.708 --> 01:44:00.337
Through the mastery of
the holy incarnation

982
01:44:00.338 --> 01:44:03.196
O Lord, deliver us.

983
01:44:03.466 --> 01:44:04.967
Through thy coming

984
01:44:07.053 --> 01:44:11.038
I will destroy you!

985
01:44:14.686 --> 01:44:17.888
Through thy nativity,
O Lord, deliver us.

986
01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:23.551
Through thy baptism and
thy holy fasting, deliver us.

987
01:44:24.237 --> 01:44:27.823
Through thy temptation, 40 days
and 40 nights in the desert

988
01:44:27.824 --> 01:44:29.899
O Lord, deliver us.

989
01:44:31.286 --> 01:44:33.923
Through thy sacrifice on the cross

990
01:44:34.414 --> 01:44:37.236
O Lord, deliver us.

991
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:41.044
Through thy holy
resurrection, deliver.

992
01:44:41.045 --> 01:44:44.882
Through the coming of
the Holy Ghost, deliver.

993
01:44:44.883 --> 01:44:49.667
Be uprooted and expelled
from this creature of God.

994
01:44:50.388 --> 01:44:52.997
Hear therefore

995
01:44:53.183 --> 01:44:55.756
and fear

996
01:44:56.311 --> 01:44:58.061
Satan!

997
01:45:14.329 --> 01:45:17.151
In the name of Archangel Michael

998
01:45:18.249 --> 01:45:21.239
whose church this is

999
01:45:22.253 --> 01:45:24.588
in the name of all those

1000
01:45:24.589 --> 01:45:27.080
who have died for our Savior

1001
01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:31.998
in the name of Christ
and all his saints

1002
01:45:32.597 --> 01:45:35.373
I cast thee out.

1003
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:38.173
The faith of the
saints casts you out.

1004
01:45:38.812 --> 01:45:41.670
The blood of the
martyrs casts you out.

1005
01:45:41.731 --> 01:45:47.069
The heavenly host of all those
saved and in grace casts you out.

1006
01:45:49.072 --> 01:45:51.230
Please.

1007
01:45:51.449 --> 01:45:55.317
Oh, Cheche. Have faith, Cheche.

1008
01:46:02.877 --> 01:46:05.534
I will kill you both!

1009
01:46:09.676 --> 01:46:12.831
With my last effort,
I will oppose you.

1010
01:46:15.139 --> 01:46:18.684
From one end of the
world to the other

1011
01:46:18.685 --> 01:46:21.395
I will oppose you.

1012
01:46:21.396 --> 01:46:23.981
Until my soul burns in hell

1013
01:46:23.982 --> 01:46:26.591
I will oppose you!

1014
01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:34.899
Stop.

1015
01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:40.987
We exorcise you, each unclean spirit.

1016
01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:44.835
We cast you out,
each power of Satan

1017
01:46:44.836 --> 01:46:47.445
each infestation of the enemy.

1018
01:46:50.884 --> 01:46:55.711
Repel, O Lord,
the power of this evil prince!

1019
01:47:33.259 --> 01:47:35.594
In the name of the Father

1020
01:47:35.595 --> 01:47:37.221
the Son

1021
01:47:37.222 --> 01:47:39.723
and the Holy Ghost

1022
01:47:39.724 --> 01:47:42.416
I absolve thee.

1023
01:48:23.268 --> 01:48:26.645
He wants to know if you're certain
the demon in the church is gone.

1024
01:48:26.646 --> 01:48:29.885
Yes, from here.

1025
01:48:39.409 --> 01:48:42.149
He wishes you strength.

1026
01:48:42.495 --> 01:48:45.330
He says the demon
is your enemy now

1027
01:48:45.331 --> 01:48:47.485
and he will pursue you.

1028
01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:23.902
We'll be ready
to pull out within the hour.

1029
01:49:24.662 --> 01:49:26.856
Oh, and Father Merrin

1030
01:49:27.874 --> 01:49:31.409
anyone asks me
about this place, sir

1031
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:33.837
I didn't see a thing.

1032
01:49:33.838 --> 01:49:36.696
They won't get anything out of me.

1033
01:49:37.425 --> 01:49:39.537
Good luck.

1034
01:49:45.809 --> 01:49:47.967
I've got myself a new helper.

1035
01:49:50.730 --> 01:49:55.849
Good day.

1036
01:49:58.029 --> 01:50:01.865
You're leaving too?
Well, not just yet, but soon.

1037
01:50:01.866 --> 01:50:03.867
Where?
To Rome.

1038
01:50:03.868 --> 01:50:06.203
They want a report.

1039
01:50:06.204 --> 01:50:10.916
Yes, the Church is a leaky
structure, but it's all I have.

1040
01:50:10.917 --> 01:50:14.368
I think the Holy See will
find some use for me.

1041
01:50:38.403 --> 01:50:40.680
Will you write me?

1042
01:50:40.822 --> 01:50:42.684
Here?

1043
01:50:42.824 --> 01:50:46.359
They need me here.
Yes.

1044
01:50:47.412 --> 01:50:49.570
Write me.

1045
01:55:47.212 --> 01:55:51.031
I am perfection.
