1
00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:21.455
Yeah! Go, buddy, go!

2
00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:25.835
That baby's going scared. Ha-ha-ha.

3
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.045
Whoo! Yeah!

4
00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:31.255
Hell, yeah!

5
00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.925
- Excited, yeah?
- Go, baby! Ooh!

6
00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:36.635
Yeah!

7
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.355
I don't wanna do nothing—

8
00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.695
We got her, bro. Here we go.

9
00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:54.238
Give me one.

10
00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.990
Get them, get them, get them.

11
00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:57.366
Hey, boys!

12
00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.826
How y'all doing today?

13
00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.537
What are you looking at?
You wanna get shot?

14
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.831
You wanna get shot? Woo-hoo!

15
00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.335
Go, baby!

16
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:10.338
- Got it!
- Pearl Harbor! Pearl Harbor!

17
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.224
Hey!

18
00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.227
And here's another one.

19
00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:25.978
Watch this, Billy Ray!

20
00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.188
Hundred points!

21
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.732
Yeah!

22
00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.743
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Uh-huh.

23
00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:08.563
- Bye, Tonya.
- Bye.

24
00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.158
Clean up that mess, boy.

25
00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:24.453
- Pete, hungry?
- Huh?

26
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.164
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

27
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.877
- Oh, you're not having anything?
- Yeah, I'm having them.

28
00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.964
Course, it's shit.

29
00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.966
- Bye, girls.
- Bye, Daddy.

30
00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.926
Let's go, Max.

31
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.973
Get in the house, pup. Harry Rex.

32
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.144
All those weekends, fishing,
drinking, lounging...

33
00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:51.814
opportunities lost
to do-it-yourself house renovations.

34
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:55.151
- Tragic, just tragic, Jake.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.529
Makes Carla happy, my man.

36
00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.741
Spent four marriages trying to figure out
what makes women happy.

37
00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.367
You have spent four marriages...

38
00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.412
trying to figure out what makes
you happy, who you kidding?

39
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.706
Oh, yeah. Maybe that's it.

40
00:04:08.874 --> 00:04:10.166
Yeah, maybe.

41
00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:13.127
- Swiggy?
- Lord, please let my car be fixed today.

42
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:15.129
Oh, dear.

43
00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:31.646
Hey, who's that?

44
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.692
She looks a little young.

45
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.903
- Hold this.
- What are you gonna do?

46
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:42.823
You know how I say if they're old enough
to crawl, they're in the right position.

47
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.493
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do? You crazy.

48
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.876
- Whoo! Yeah! Fifty points!
- Ha-ha-ha.

49
00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:55.378
Yeah, you good, boy.

50
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:58.172
Shut up!

51
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.675
- Daddy!
- Hey!

52
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.596
- Shut up.
- Daddy!

53
00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.723
Shut up.

54
00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.767
- I'll kill you.
- My turn.

55
00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.730
- Daddy!
- Shut up.

56
00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:16.899
Daddy.

57
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.195
Yeah.

58
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.866
Mom! Mama!

59
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.661
Mom! Mama!

60
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.579
Mom!

61
00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.668
Mama!

62
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:38.087
Mom.

63
00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:42.633
- What is this?
- Groceries.

64
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.594
- Y'all didn't see her?
- No, ma'am.

65
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.646
Carl Lee! Stop!

66
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:59.275
- You got a call from your wife!
- What? What?

67
00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.846
How many appointments
do we have today, Ethel?

68
00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:31.265
Not a one.

69
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.602
But it is the 1st of the month again
and guess what.

70
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.023
The checks are pouring in and we have
enough money to pay all our past debts.

71
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:41.609
That'll be your last drink.

72
00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:44.904
Just keep us no more than
one month behind on any vendor, please.

73
00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.947
Why, you have been drinking.

74
00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.157
Two months.

75
00:06:48.325 --> 00:06:50.409
Well, these are the most delinquent.

76
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.745
The rent's in there.

77
00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:58.209
I appreciate the practice, capitán, I do,
but you could've left me a couple of clients.

78
00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.010
Baby, here's Daddy.

79
00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:14.558
Oh, no.

80
00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:20.189
I'm here, baby. Daddy's here.

81
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:24.193
Daddy, I'm sorry I dropped the groceries.

82
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:28.197
- That's all right, baby. It's all right, baby.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

83
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.199
That's all right.

84
00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.810
Look at this.

85
00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:26.547
Billy Ray?

86
00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:32.052
Sorry, sir, but we don't allow
no African-Americans in here. Ha, ha.

87
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.222
Billy Ray Cobb, you and Mr. Willard
need to come with me.

88
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.600
Hell, no. I ain't moving.

89
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.811
- You know that little girl you took for a ride?
- Mm.

90
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:44.231
- What little girl?
- I got bad news for you. She didn't die.

91
00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:48.694
So unless there's another redneck asshole
got a souped-up yellow pickup...

92
00:08:48.862 --> 00:08:51.280
with a Confederate flag
in the windshield—

93
00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.909
Blue gums, why don't you take your
black ass out of here and grab a branch.

94
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:59.121
Unless you got an explanation for what
this was doing in the bed of your truck...

95
00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.625
you're going to jail. Now, get up.

96
00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.628
You can go to hell, nigger.

97
00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.255
- Unh! Goddamn!
- Hey!

98
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:15.387
Now, you earned
the right to remain silent.

99
00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:18.599
- Here you go, just the way you like them.
- Thank you.

100
00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.435
- Dell, sugar, today I'm gonna have—
- Go to hell, Harry.

101
00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.021
On second thought,
I'm just gonna watch baby eat his.

102
00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:26.232
I am not the one
who handled her divorce.

103
00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.317
Can't she see
I'm shriveling away here?

104
00:09:28.485 --> 00:09:29.944
I'm shriveling.

105
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.738
- Say, Jake?
- Yeah, what's up, Dwayne?

106
00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.325
Didn't you defend Billy Ray Cobb
few years back?

107
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:39.703
What kind of case was it?

108
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.330
Caught him selling dope.

109
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.666
Spent time in Parchman.
Got out last year.

110
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.919
No, I think some Memphis lawyer
handled that.

111
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:48.754
Why do you ask?

112
00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:51.507
Well, we picked him up for rape.
Him and Pete Willard.

113
00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:52.841
Who'd they rape?

114
00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.011
You know Carl Lee Hailey?

115
00:09:56.388 --> 00:09:58.305
Sure, I defended his brother Lester.

116
00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.393
It was his little girl.

117
00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:06.563
Little Tonya?

118
00:10:07.983 --> 00:10:09.733
Yeah.

119
00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.112
How old is she?

120
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.365
She's 10.

121
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.827
Mr. Willard, I'm Sheriff Ozzie Walls.

122
00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:05.205
My mama voted for you.

123
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.751
I seen you play for the Rams.

124
00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:14.798
Way I figure, a nigger sheriff's okay,
been on TV and all.

125
00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.011
No offense.

126
00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:23.849
What's your full name?

127
00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:26.435
James Lewis Willard.

128
00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:33.525
Four, which is a difference of 110.60.

129
00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.781
Who's there?

130
00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:59.468
Carl Lee.

131
00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.725
How is she?

132
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.812
She holding on.

133
00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:13.607
Doctor says she ain't
out of the woods yet, though.

134
00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:23.867
They worked her over
something good, Jake.

135
00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:35.754
You remember them four white boys raped
that little black girl in the Delta last year?

136
00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:39.341
Yeah.

137
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:41.343
They, uh...

138
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:43.053
They got off, didn't they?

139
00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:46.932
Yeah.

140
00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.564
Jake...

141
00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.692
I was in a jam, you'd help me out,
wouldn't you?

142
00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.863
Sure, Carl Lee.

143
00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.908
What kind of jam you talking about?

144
00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:08.245
You got a daughter, Jake.

145
00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.289
What would you do?

146
00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.926
Dream some good dreams, baby girl.

147
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.721
Good night, Daddy.

148
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.890
Night, baby.

149
00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.616
- Is she asleep?
- Yeah.

150
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.535
- Is she the sweetest thing?
- Yeah, she is.

151
00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.704
Next to you.

152
00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:55.751
Tell you what, I look at her, though, and
I cannot help but think about little Tonya.

153
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.087
Don't.

154
00:14:01.925 --> 00:14:04.009
Don't do that to yourself.

155
00:14:04.761 --> 00:14:05.844
Yeah.

156
00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.099
Something else wrong?

157
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.520
Tonya's father...

158
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.772
Carl Lee Hailey...

159
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.273
came by the office today.

160
00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:23.278
Man's heart is torn wide open, baby.

161
00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.030
I don't know, but...

162
00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:28.033
sounded to me
like he was thinking about doing something.

163
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.243
Like what?

164
00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.996
Something like maybe
killing those two boys.

165
00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:34.957
Was he serious?

166
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.129
I don't know. I don't know.

167
00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.966
It could've been just the hurt talking,
you know?

168
00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:48.136
But when you think that it's possible
that those two animals could...

169
00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.180
go free...

170
00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:53.475
and be walking the streets...

171
00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.604
I...

172
00:14:58.356 --> 00:14:59.648
I don't know.

173
00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:05.529
After what that man has been through,
he's probably capable of anything.

174
00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.241
Somebody should do something.

175
00:15:09.826 --> 00:15:11.493
You should call Sheriff Walls.

176
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.663
Yeah.

177
00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:13.263
To release the owner from assessment.

178
00:16:16.643 --> 00:16:21.063
I hope I'm having a heart attack
because then I'd get to sue you.

179
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.899
Don't stand on ceremony, come on in.

180
00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.068
What? No clients?

181
00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:29.071
Just waiting to pick yours up
on appeal, Harry.

182
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:32.574
And you, are you on vacation?

183
00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.285
Fortunately for me, my lovely...

184
00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.746
divorce doesn't go on vacation.

185
00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:39.581
However...

186
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:43.335
not even the richest,
most ridiculous settlement I ever bring in...

187
00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:46.296
is gonna be as satisfying
as watching those two hyenas...

188
00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:49.966
across the street
get what's coming to them.

189
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:55.639
Oh, dear.

190
00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:02.479
You know I'm a fool for those, um,
German-type convertibles.

191
00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:06.274
Come on, lover boy, let's get to court.

192
00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.361
Lucien thinks the two hyenas
just might get off.

193
00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.113
You saw Lucien?

194
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.906
When? Where?

195
00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.157
How is he?

196
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.201
Has he been eating any better?

197
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.497
Just curious.

198
00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.999
Um, Miss Ethel...

199
00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:27.379
refresh my recollection, how long
were you and Lucien together for exactly?

200
00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.755
We were never together.

201
00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:31.007
I was his secretary for 20 years.

202
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:32.968
Come on, old girl.

203
00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.637
- You can tell us, you know.
- He was your boyfriend.

204
00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:39.725
I am an upstanding, God-fearing,
respectable Southern woman...

205
00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:44.020
with unimpeachable morals
who has been happily married for 27 years.

206
00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:48.108
And I have never had
or ever will have any boyfriend.

207
00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.776
And if I did...

208
00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:55.031
it certainly would not be
that old pickled scoundrel Lucien Wilbanks.

209
00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:02.122
She did him. Oh, yeah, a lot.

210
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.173
All right, Billy Ray, step on back.

211
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:14.259
Come on out. Willard.

212
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.181
All right, boys, today's your big day.

213
00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:21.224
We're gonna take a trip
to the courthouse.

214
00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:23.059
The judge is gonna set your bail.

215
00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:26.021
Then we're gonna come back here,
all nice and peaceful-like.

216
00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:31.067
I get any trouble out of you,
I'm going to integrate this jail.

217
00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:00.866
Mama, Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!

218
00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.327
Hannah girl, let's go inside for a minute.

219
00:20:04.495 --> 00:20:07.038
Give Daddy some time to himself.

220
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:10.792
- Let's— Let's find a book, okay?
- I wanna see Daddy.

221
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.419
Honey?

222
00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:46.536
Jake? Jake? Are you hurt?
Jake, what happened to you?

223
00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:49.539
Jake, honey, are you okay?
What happened to you?

224
00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:53.001
What is this? What is going on with you?
What happened?

225
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.045
Jake, baby.

226
00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:58.256
What happened?

227
00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:33.541
Okay, okay.

228
00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:50.684
See you, Gwen.

229
00:22:04.782 --> 00:22:06.658
Is the sheriff gonna make a statement?

230
00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:08.618
He might, he might not. I don't know.

231
00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:11.413
- Is it first-degree murder?
- I'm not sure yet.

232
00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.581
What happened?
Can you tell us something?

233
00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:16.960
- Sheriff, will you give us a statement.
- I got no comment. No comment.

234
00:22:17.128 --> 00:22:20.088
Hey. Hey, Jake.
Hey, Jake, Carl Lee said you'd be coming.

235
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:22.549
- Sir, are you an attorney?
- Are you an attorney?

236
00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:26.094
Now, I'll make a statement.
I want y'all to get these vans out of here.

237
00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:28.513
Sir, we've gotta get something
for our newscast.

238
00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:50.118
Didn't think I'd do it, did you?

239
00:22:53.873 --> 00:22:55.707
How you holding up?

240
00:22:59.962 --> 00:23:03.465
I ain't had nothing against them boys
till they messed with my baby.

241
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:08.595
And I feel sorry for their mamas
and their daddies, but...

242
00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.264
I ain't sorry for what I done.

243
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:15.643
How's Looney?

244
00:23:18.481 --> 00:23:20.273
You blew his knee right off his leg.

245
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.485
Doctors are still with him.

246
00:23:27.448 --> 00:23:28.948
What's gonna happen to me now?

247
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.744
There's gonna be a preliminary hearing.

248
00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:35.205
Probably tomorrow.

249
00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:37.832
After that, Buckley will push
for a fast trial.

250
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:39.959
Who's Buckley?

251
00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:41.628
Rufus Buckley.

252
00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:42.837
District attorney.

253
00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:47.008
He's mean, he's ambitious, and he's
gonna eat this up because of the publicity.

254
00:23:47.176 --> 00:23:48.968
But you've done beat him, ain't you?

255
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.137
Yeah.

256
00:23:51.514 --> 00:23:53.139
Not in a murder case.

257
00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:58.478
Think I can win?

258
00:23:59.355 --> 00:24:01.731
All depends on the jury, Carl Lee.

259
00:24:02.858 --> 00:24:04.734
Pick the right jury, and you walk.

260
00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:08.196
DA picks the jury...

261
00:24:08.364 --> 00:24:09.656
and you get the gas.

262
00:24:13.202 --> 00:24:14.828
Well, how much—?

263
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.996
How much a case like this cost?

264
00:24:20.042 --> 00:24:21.417
Probably 50 grand.

265
00:24:23.671 --> 00:24:26.631
I can pay maybe 10.

266
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:38.560
Well, not a lot of white lawyers
would've took my brother Lester's case.

267
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:41.563
You did and got him off.

268
00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:47.986
I figure there's a lot of people out there
tired of all the raping and killing.

269
00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:52.115
They'd be sympathetic to a man
who took the law into his own hands...

270
00:24:52.283 --> 00:24:53.992
even if he is black.

271
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.170
You said you'd help me out
if I was in a jam, Jake.

272
00:25:05.588 --> 00:25:08.214
Well, I'm in one now.

273
00:25:09.425 --> 00:25:10.550
What you say?

274
00:25:13.179 --> 00:25:16.222
- What can you tell us, sheriff?
- Can you tell us what happened?

275
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.058
- Are you with the police department?
- No, I am a lawyer.

276
00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:21.019
Are you Carl Lee Hailey's attorney?

277
00:25:21.979 --> 00:25:24.439
Sir, are you Mr. Hailey's attorney?

278
00:25:24.607 --> 00:25:25.773
Yes, I am.

279
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:28.193
- What's your name, sir?
- Brigance. Jake Brigance.

280
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.694
That's with one G.

281
00:25:37.328 --> 00:25:38.786
Hailey's hired an attorney.

282
00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:40.538
Jake Brigance.

283
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.502
And today ain't even my birthday.

284
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.048
Brigance couldn't tie his own tie
without that old drunk Wilbanks.

285
00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:52.175
Telling the press
he never lost a murder case.

286
00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:54.469
Well, he's never tried one against me,
has he?

287
00:25:54.637 --> 00:25:57.138
- What time's the preliminary?
- Tomorrow at 3.

288
00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:59.098
Judge Omar Noose presiding.

289
00:25:59.725 --> 00:26:02.143
Oh, I was wrong. It is my birthday.

290
00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:06.105
All right. First things first,
Brigance will file for a change of venue.

291
00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:09.317
- Guy would be a fool if he didn't.
- Why's that?

292
00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:10.944
Why?

293
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:13.446
Should we tell our young,
uninformed law clerk...

294
00:26:13.614 --> 00:26:15.782
the reality of jurisprudence
in this county?

295
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.078
Evelyn, get me the state file
on race statistics.

296
00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:21.871
You see, Taylor, it's quite simple.

297
00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:25.124
This county's 26-, 30-percent black,
give or take.

298
00:26:25.292 --> 00:26:29.420
Almost every other county is 40-, 45-,
in some cases 70-percent black.

299
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.714
Blacks are more sympathetic
to other blacks.

300
00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:34.968
If he gets it moved, he has
a greater chance of color in the jury.

301
00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:36.219
We know what that means.

302
00:26:36.387 --> 00:26:39.555
But if the trial stays here,
it's an all-white jury for sure.

303
00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:41.349
Now, Taylor, this is for you...

304
00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.394
to integrate your brain with
before 3:00 tomorrow.

305
00:26:44.561 --> 00:26:46.896
- Yes.
- He means without blacks on the jury...

306
00:26:47.064 --> 00:26:49.065
Hailey hasn't got a chance in hell.

307
00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:52.360
- All right, Noose is up for re-elect?
- Yeah, November.

308
00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:54.612
Reach out to our friends
in the legislature.

309
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.408
Have them call on Noose. We're gonna
help him decide to keep this case in Canton.

310
00:26:58.575 --> 00:27:02.412
Also, send a case of whatever it is
he's drinking these days to Lucien Wilbanks.

311
00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:06.082
- I believe that's Dewars.
- Keep that old drunk on the sidelines.

312
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.333
Yeah, get me Sam.

313
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:09.252
And, gentlemen?

314
00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:13.756
No mistakes.
This is the one we've been waiting for.

315
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.385
Justifiable homicide will never hold up.

316
00:27:17.553 --> 00:27:20.179
Then my only chance
is to find a shrink who'll testify...

317
00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:22.765
Carl Lee was insane
at the time of the murders.

318
00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:27.228
Well, I might know a man
who owes me a favor.

319
00:27:27.896 --> 00:27:31.482
- You'll file for change of venue.
- Of course.

320
00:27:32.568 --> 00:27:35.236
Judge Noose denies it...

321
00:27:35.404 --> 00:27:38.906
then you'll get an all-white jury
and you'll lose.

322
00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:40.825
Thank you for the encouragement.

323
00:27:40.993 --> 00:27:45.913
Well, bear in mind that Mr. Hailey
is as guilty as sin under our legal system.

324
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:51.919
It does not permit vigilante violence,
and he took the law into his own hands.

325
00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:54.589
He murdered two people.

326
00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:59.635
Two people who had raped
his 10-year-old daughter.

327
00:28:01.764 --> 00:28:03.139
You know...

328
00:28:03.307 --> 00:28:05.558
you can win this case...

329
00:28:05.726 --> 00:28:07.894
and justice will prevail.

330
00:28:08.062 --> 00:28:09.645
But lose...

331
00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:14.192
and justice will also prevail.
Now, that's a strange case.

332
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.985
Yeah.

333
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.989
I could use your help.

334
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.411
The sons of bitches decertified me, Jake.

335
00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:28.956
I swore I will never
enter another courtroom ever.

336
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:32.543
Lucien, you're the best lawyer
I've ever seen.

337
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:35.713
Now, I know how much it hurt
when they took your license away...

338
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:38.341
but they can't take your mind
unless you let them.

339
00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:40.843
Good speech.

340
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:43.137
Well, I had a good teacher.

341
00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:46.265
Now, you remember when I came to you
out of law school?

342
00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:48.851
In a ridiculous blue suit.

343
00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:50.395
Yeah.

344
00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:54.982
Now, you sat me down and you said to me,
"Young man, I cannot promise you riches.

345
00:28:55.317 --> 00:28:58.820
What I can offer you
is a chance to save the world...

346
00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:00.405
one case at a time."

347
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:06.661
Well, I'm saying the same words
back to you right now.

348
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.205
How about it, Lucien?

349
00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:15.503
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

350
00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:18.798
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

351
00:29:18.966 --> 00:29:21.509
He leadeth me beside still waters.

352
00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:25.346
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

353
00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:29.851
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

354
00:29:30.018 --> 00:29:32.854
Thy rod and thy staff comfort me.

355
00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:36.399
Thou preparest a table before me...

356
00:29:36.567 --> 00:29:39.152
Sure am sorry about your brother,
Freddie.

357
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:41.904
Old Willard too.

358
00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:44.407
Good boys, both.

359
00:29:49.163 --> 00:29:52.206
Ten years ago, that nigger would
be hanging by the end of a rope...

360
00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:54.292
with his balls in his mouth.

361
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.627
You tell me what's wrong
with this country.

362
00:29:57.379 --> 00:29:58.921
Klan would know what to do.

363
00:30:00.048 --> 00:30:02.008
My granddaddy, he was Klan.

364
00:30:03.093 --> 00:30:07.054
- Ain't no Klan around here for years.
- Oh, there's still some boys around.

365
00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:09.515
Them skinheads who want to
blow up the government?

366
00:30:09.683 --> 00:30:12.810
No, sir. Good God-fearing Klan.

367
00:30:15.189 --> 00:30:17.607
I got a friend, used to be active.

368
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:18.900
I could give him a call.

369
00:30:20.736 --> 00:30:22.778
You do that, Winston.

370
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:25.823
You tell them boys we need
some Klan down here in Canton.

371
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:28.034
I mean right quick.

372
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:32.455
Hurry up, honey.

373
00:30:32.623 --> 00:30:34.123
Coming, coming, coming.

374
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:37.418
- Something you can tell us?
- What did Carl Lee tell you?

375
00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:39.212
There's Ozzie.

376
00:30:40.589 --> 00:30:44.759
- To our family's television debut.
- To the big time.

377
00:30:45.385 --> 00:30:49.138
I cannot believe he didn't take you seriously
when you warned him.

378
00:30:49.306 --> 00:30:52.683
Well, baby, you know, some folks
think those boys got what they deserved.

379
00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:56.187
Here, sweet pea. Carl Lee Hailey
may very well spend his life in prison.

380
00:30:56.355 --> 00:30:58.147
That is nothing his family deserves.

381
00:30:58.315 --> 00:30:59.607
- Yeah.
- You did call Ozzie—

382
00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:02.443
- Lookit here. Look who's—
- Daddy's on TV.

383
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:06.572
I intend to show the men and women of the
South to look past color and see the truth.

384
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:11.160
That here in the South— In the new South,
justice is and will be colorblind.

385
00:31:13.747 --> 00:31:16.290
- Impressive. Honey, that was really good.
- Hmm?

386
00:31:16.458 --> 00:31:18.834
- Isn't Daddy smart?
- Mm-hm.

387
00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:20.461
Yeah. Brigance.

388
00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:21.796
- Mm-hm.
- That was great.

389
00:31:21.964 --> 00:31:24.048
Yeah. No, we just saw it.

390
00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:25.550
All right, Harry Rex. Yeah.

391
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:26.926
Baby, I'm proud of you.

392
00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:29.637
- Good stuff, huh?
- Mm-hm.

393
00:31:29.805 --> 00:31:32.014
- You hear this?
- Put it on speakerphone.

394
00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:34.058
Don't be gross.

395
00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:37.562
- Ahem. F. Lee Bailey's office.
- Brigance.

396
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:42.483
You nigger-loving son-of-a-bitch,
you won't live if the nigger walks.

397
00:31:42.651 --> 00:31:45.319
Hey, hey. Hey.

398
00:31:46.113 --> 00:31:48.155
Do you have any sympathy for the defense?

399
00:31:48.323 --> 00:31:51.325
Well, of course I do, Stephanie.
You're a mother, I'm a father.

400
00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:54.287
We all have families. Who wouldn't?

401
00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:56.789
Don't presume the district attorney
is insensitive.

402
00:31:56.957 --> 00:31:59.000
But the people
of the state of Mississippi...

403
00:31:59.167 --> 00:32:01.752
entrusted this office
to uphold the law of the land.

404
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.131
Our society cannot condone men
who take the law into their own hands.

405
00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:06.549
No matter the circumstance.

406
00:32:06.717 --> 00:32:09.385
If you get a conviction,
will you ask for the gas chamber?

407
00:32:09.553 --> 00:32:12.179
Yes, I will seek the death penalty
for Mr. Hailey.

408
00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:14.181
What do you think of Mr. Brigance?

409
00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:16.392
Isn't that boy still in law school?

410
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.644
Say hey to your husband for me, Kim.
That's all.

411
00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:36.203
Hey, Cora Mae, don't you worry.
Hey, Wayne, how are you?

412
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:37.955
Good luck.

413
00:32:39.541 --> 00:32:42.585
You plead him guilty today, I'll ask for life.
Otherwise, he dies.

414
00:32:42.753 --> 00:32:46.339
You drop your case now, and I won't
bury you before the entire county, Rufus.

415
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.008
All rise.

416
00:32:50.844 --> 00:32:54.513
Court is in session.
The Honorable Omar Noose presiding.

417
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:57.058
Good afternoon, citizens.

418
00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:00.728
Be seated.

419
00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:02.480
Counsel.

420
00:33:02.648 --> 00:33:04.231
And you, sir.

421
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:06.901
- Are you Carl Lee Hailey?
- Yes, sir.

422
00:33:07.069 --> 00:33:11.072
Uh, Mr. Hailey, I am holding
a copy of an indictment returned...

423
00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:14.742
by the grand jury of Mississippi
presenting that:

424
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:19.622
"Carl Lee Hailey did murder Billy Ray Cobb,
a human being...

425
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.625
and James Lewis Willard,
a human being...

426
00:33:22.793 --> 00:33:26.837
and did attempt to kill Dwayne Looney,
a peace officer...

427
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:30.049
against the peace and dignity
of the state of Mississippi."

428
00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:32.927
Now, do you understand
the charges against you?

429
00:33:33.387 --> 00:33:35.971
- Yes, sir.
- How do you wish to plead?

430
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.850
Not guilty, Your Honor.

431
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:44.480
The defense enters a plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity, Your Honor.

432
00:33:44.648 --> 00:33:46.649
Your trial is set for July 22.

433
00:33:46.817 --> 00:33:51.112
All pretrial motions and matters
should be filed no later than July 8.

434
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.738
- Is there anything further?
- Yes.

435
00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:55.032
Your Honor,
in response to the insanity plea...

436
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.285
the state requests the defendant
be examined by its own doctors.

437
00:33:58.453 --> 00:33:59.453
Request granted.

438
00:33:59.621 --> 00:34:02.748
Additionally,
the state opposes any request for bail.

439
00:34:02.916 --> 00:34:04.834
Your Honor,
we haven't yet asked for bail.

440
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:07.962
Now, Governor Buckley cannot oppose
a request until one is made.

441
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.005
He should've learned that in law school.

442
00:34:10.173 --> 00:34:13.759
Your Honor, even Mr. Brigance's
meager legal experience...

443
00:34:13.927 --> 00:34:18.097
should've taught him two things.
One, I have not been elected governor yet.

444
00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:21.142
And number two,
he is required to request bail.

445
00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:22.935
The state opposes any such request.

446
00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:26.480
In the future, why don't we just wait
till he makes the request, huh?

447
00:34:26.732 --> 00:34:27.940
Thank you, Your Honor.

448
00:34:28.108 --> 00:34:30.651
- Your Honor, we would like to request bail.
- Denied.

449
00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:34.196
I have never allowed bail
in a capital-murder case...

450
00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:37.700
and don't feel
that an exception is called for today.

451
00:34:37.868 --> 00:34:38.993
Good enough.

452
00:34:39.161 --> 00:34:41.245
We will be filing for a change of venue.

453
00:34:41.413 --> 00:34:42.830
I anticipated this.

454
00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:45.583
Let me save you some time,
Mr. Brigance.

455
00:34:45.751 --> 00:34:47.251
Your motion is denied.

456
00:34:47.419 --> 00:34:49.336
Your Honor, we have not yet filed.

457
00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:53.382
We are simply indicating
our intent to file in writing by letting you—

458
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.843
I said, request denied.

459
00:34:56.553 --> 00:34:57.928
Your Honor...

460
00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:01.307
how can you summarily deny
this request?

461
00:35:01.475 --> 00:35:04.810
It is quite clear that Carl Lee Hailey
cannot receive a fair trial here.

462
00:35:04.978 --> 00:35:07.438
- Now, we feel—
- That's enough. Sidebar.

463
00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:09.023
Your Honor, we have a right—

464
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:12.067
Mr. Brigance.

465
00:35:12.235 --> 00:35:15.780
I will not tolerate grandstanding
in my courtroom.

466
00:35:23.789 --> 00:35:25.790
Get back to work.

467
00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:29.543
Excellent technique, counselor.

468
00:35:41.515 --> 00:35:42.556
Your Honor.

469
00:35:42.808 --> 00:35:46.393
We feel it would be remiss not to tell you
that in State v. Johnson...

470
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.187
and State v. Fisher...

471
00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:50.189
both in 1985...

472
00:35:50.357 --> 00:35:53.025
failure to properly consider
a change of venue...

473
00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:56.612
has been a reversible decision on appeal
to the state supreme court.

474
00:35:58.073 --> 00:36:02.952
No... No trial judge
likes his rulings overturned.

475
00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:09.291
I guess you get to submit that brief after all.
Have it on my desk by Tuesday morning.

476
00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:12.419
Mr. Hailey, you are hereby ordered...

477
00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:17.675
to remain in custody of
the Madison County sheriff until trial.

478
00:36:17.843 --> 00:36:18.884
Dismissed.

479
00:36:28.395 --> 00:36:31.146
Find me that state doctor.
What's his name? Rodeheaver.

480
00:36:31.314 --> 00:36:33.107
Get him down here to interview Hailey.

481
00:36:33.275 --> 00:36:37.111
Since he's not able to afford a real one,
find who Brigance is using for a shrink.

482
00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:40.281
- I want him discredited.
- You want professional or personal dirt?

483
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.950
I don't wanna know how.
Get me enough to shatter him.

484
00:36:43.118 --> 00:36:44.994
We can do that. Taylor.

485
00:36:50.292 --> 00:36:54.336
This is $900, Carl Lee.
We said a thousand down.

486
00:36:54.504 --> 00:36:56.797
My kids gotta eat.

487
00:36:57.632 --> 00:36:59.383
Mine too.

488
00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:03.637
All right, when do I get the rest?

489
00:37:04.097 --> 00:37:07.349
Them folks over at the bank,
they won't loan me no money on my house.

490
00:37:07.517 --> 00:37:11.896
Why not? Your house is almost paid for.
You borrowed on it before for Lester's trial.

491
00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:13.647
Said I wasn't in jail before.

492
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:16.525
Said to Gwen, how am I gonna pay
sitting on death row?

493
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.194
And I lost my job at the mill.

494
00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:20.529
They called Gwen.

495
00:37:20.697 --> 00:37:24.783
Worked 20 years,
I'm out five days and they fired me.

496
00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:31.624
Carl Lee, I can't try
a capital-murder case for $900.

497
00:37:31.791 --> 00:37:33.584
Carl Lee, I need to live.

498
00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:35.502
Me too, Jake.

499
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.254
I need to live too.

500
00:37:46.973 --> 00:37:48.807
Nice night.

501
00:37:54.356 --> 00:37:57.524
Finder of precedents,
mystery woman of the courthouse.

502
00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:00.653
Yup. Care for a beer?

503
00:38:03.406 --> 00:38:06.492
I assume that's the infamous
change-of-venue motion under your arm.

504
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.327
Mm-hm.

505
00:38:08.495 --> 00:38:09.870
Ellen Roark. R-O-A-R-K.

506
00:38:10.038 --> 00:38:13.749
That's Roark in Boston,
but it seems to be Roark in Mississippi.

507
00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:16.210
- Boston, huh?
- Yup, I was born there.

508
00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:18.796
My father's the notorious Sheldon Roark.

509
00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:20.547
Attorney to the stars, yes.

510
00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:22.257
Duly impressed.

511
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:25.511
What brings you to Mississippi, Roark?
Slumming?

512
00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:27.680
No, law school at Ole Miss.

513
00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:29.932
It's a... It's a family tradition.

514
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:34.228
Mom was a sweet little sorority girl there
till Dad— Till Dad married her.

515
00:38:34.396 --> 00:38:37.731
I married a sweet little sorority girl
from Ole Miss myself.

516
00:38:37.899 --> 00:38:41.151
- Well, they have an excellent selection.
- Yes, they do.

517
00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:43.153
Now, really, what brings you to Canton?

518
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:45.906
I'm not believing they don't have cars
to sit on on campus.

519
00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:47.449
Carl Lee Hailey.

520
00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:52.246
Really like to help you with the trial.

521
00:38:52.414 --> 00:38:54.289
Now, what makes you think I need help?

522
00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:57.292
You're trying one of the largest
murder cases...

523
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.920
these parts have seen
and you work alone.

524
00:39:00.088 --> 00:39:02.339
You have no paralegals,
no clerks, researchers...

525
00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:04.466
nor can you afford to hire any...

526
00:39:04.634 --> 00:39:08.262
so if Noose doesn't accept
that motion under your arm...

527
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:13.017
you go to trial in less than a month.
Trust me, you need help.

528
00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:16.937
- Now, how do you know this?
- Well, I'm an excellent researcher.

529
00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:19.148
- I see that.
- Look, I've played gofer...

530
00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:22.109
for 7 capital-murder cases,
I've witnessed 2 executions...

531
00:39:22.277 --> 00:39:26.488
I have written briefs for the ACLU,
I'm top 5 percent of my class...

532
00:39:26.656 --> 00:39:30.117
editor of the law review,
I'm published, I'm young.

533
00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:31.410
And when I graduate...

534
00:39:31.578 --> 00:39:35.873
I intend to spend a glorious career
stomping out the death penalty.

535
00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:39.752
Let's see, what else?
Oh, genius runs in my family.

536
00:39:39.919 --> 00:39:41.295
You'll get me on the way up...

537
00:39:41.463 --> 00:39:45.215
and I really think, you know,
now is a good time to, you know, grab me.

538
00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:48.093
Mm-hm.
Is there anything else I should know?

539
00:39:48.261 --> 00:39:50.471
Uh, let's see, anything else?

540
00:39:50.638 --> 00:39:53.098
Oh, my father's filthy rich,
so I'll work for free.

541
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:56.643
What do you think?

542
00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:02.649
I think I'll drop this brief off
in Noose's night slot.

543
00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.985
Go home and see my family.

544
00:40:05.153 --> 00:40:08.822
Thank you, Roark,
but I can handle the case myself.

545
00:40:10.992 --> 00:40:12.618
Uh...

546
00:40:12.786 --> 00:40:14.912
You might wanna
look at these precedents.

547
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.623
Look at State v. Cooper
and State v. Roundtree.

548
00:40:17.791 --> 00:40:20.209
Both revenge killers, both acquitted.

549
00:40:23.505 --> 00:40:25.130
You'll change your mind.

550
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.884
See you.

551
00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:37.684
Get out. Come on.

552
00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:41.021
Wait.

553
00:40:41.189 --> 00:40:42.731
Come on.

554
00:41:04.838 --> 00:41:10.008
Mr. Cobb, this is Stump Sisson,
grand dragon of Mississippi.

555
00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:14.012
He heard you were looking to see us.

556
00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:17.599
You were right to call us, Mr. Cobb.

557
00:41:18.726 --> 00:41:21.061
They say the Klan is dead.

558
00:41:22.647 --> 00:41:27.651
Klan don't show up for a few years
and people say the Klan is dead.

559
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:30.779
Fact is, it just looks dead.

560
00:41:30.947 --> 00:41:34.158
The Klan has always been right there...

561
00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.493
under the surface.

562
00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:41.874
Just waiting for the opportunity
to deliver God's justice.

563
00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:44.251
I wanna help.

564
00:41:44.419 --> 00:41:46.420
I wanna kill that nigger.

565
00:41:46.588 --> 00:41:50.299
Niggers got plenty
of protection nowadays.

566
00:41:51.134 --> 00:41:55.596
They got the NAACP and the ACLU.

567
00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:58.098
Even the federal government.

568
00:41:58.266 --> 00:41:59.892
Hell.

569
00:42:00.101 --> 00:42:02.978
White folks ain't got a chance.

570
00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:06.064
Except the Klan.

571
00:42:09.986 --> 00:42:11.570
I'm gonna tell you what.

572
00:42:13.489 --> 00:42:16.992
You get five or six of your friends
of similar thinking...

573
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.455
and we'll initiate
the Madison County Klavern.

574
00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:24.791
Even make you leader.

575
00:42:27.253 --> 00:42:29.046
Now, you tell me...

576
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.964
who's that nigger's lawyer?

577
00:42:32.008 --> 00:42:33.217
Local boy.

578
00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:36.678
His name's Brigance.
He's got a pretty good reputation.

579
00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:40.098
He got family?

580
00:42:40.266 --> 00:42:44.019
Yes, sir. He...
He has a wife and a daughter.

581
00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:48.357
Good.

582
00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:09.878
Two, two.

583
00:43:29.899 --> 00:43:32.234
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Now, calm down.

584
00:43:32.402 --> 00:43:34.069
- No.
- Come on, calm down.

585
00:43:34.237 --> 00:43:38.115
- Calm down.
- He has no right after what he did.

586
00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:40.075
No, he's got no right, sheriff.

587
00:43:40.243 --> 00:43:42.661
Don't get your mom upset now.

588
00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:57.759
Looney?

589
00:43:58.761 --> 00:44:00.012
Dwayne?

590
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.394
I made Ozzie bring me.

591
00:44:12.108 --> 00:44:14.026
Shit, Dwayne, we—

592
00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:16.236
We known each other
since we was kids.

593
00:44:21.534 --> 00:44:22.909
It's my fault.

594
00:44:24.037 --> 00:44:25.746
No matter what gets said in court...

595
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:31.501
I knew what I was doing,
and I sure didn't intend to hurt you...

596
00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:33.086
but just them two boys.

597
00:44:38.593 --> 00:44:41.636
I know it don't mean much now...

598
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.889
but I'm sorry.

599
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:55.650
Some folks think that a black man
cannot receive a fair trial in the South.

600
00:44:56.110 --> 00:45:00.113
I intend to show the men and women of
the South will look past color and see truth.

601
00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:01.948
It sure is a nigger's world.

602
00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:03.575
Not for long.

603
00:45:05.787 --> 00:45:10.123
Boys, I am very proud
to invite you to become soldiers...

604
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:13.293
in the war to protect
our Christian homes and families.

605
00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:18.256
To resurrect our country
from the fires of racial degradation.

606
00:45:18.424 --> 00:45:24.179
And to make white people
the sole masters of our nation's destiny.

607
00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:26.932
What I'm saying, fellas...

608
00:45:27.642 --> 00:45:29.601
it's time for the nigger to pay.

609
00:45:32.647 --> 00:45:36.691
- Something wrong with your telephone?
- No, we just had the number changed.

610
00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:38.568
That's what the operator said.

611
00:45:38.736 --> 00:45:40.862
- To an unlisted number.
- Yeah.

612
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:43.156
I'm sorry you had to
come all the way up here.

613
00:45:43.324 --> 00:45:45.158
I should've called you, but this case—

614
00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:49.079
This case has us all worried sick
about you all, Jake.

615
00:45:49.247 --> 00:45:52.999
And you know this thing could get ugly.
And dangerous.

616
00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:56.461
Jake, he shot them in cold blood.

617
00:45:56.629 --> 00:46:00.590
They raped and almost murdered
his daughter, Sarah.

618
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:02.884
What if the same thing
happened to Hannah?

619
00:46:03.052 --> 00:46:06.304
Brigance! Mr. Brigance! Mr. Brigance!

620
00:46:06.472 --> 00:46:09.099
- May we ask a few questions?
- Can we get a quote?

621
00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:10.851
- Mr. Brigance.
- Excuse me a second.

622
00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:13.019
I'm going to go take a few questions.

623
00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:16.064
- Jake, this isn't the time.
- This is really good for Carl Lee.

624
00:46:16.232 --> 00:46:17.858
I'll be right back.

625
00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:20.986
Thank y'all for coming.

626
00:46:25.867 --> 00:46:29.035
I guess we'll have to read about it
in the papers.

627
00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:27.385
Praise Jesus!

628
00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.654
- Reverend Agee?
- Yes.

629
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:47.322
I'm Isaiah Street.

630
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.116
Well, it's an honor to meet you,
Reverend.

631
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:52.369
I saw you march with Dr. King.

632
00:47:52.537 --> 00:47:58.542
Well, well. The struggle continues today
here in Canton.

633
00:47:59.126 --> 00:48:01.419
Carl Lee Hailey's on trial
because he's black.

634
00:48:01.587 --> 00:48:02.879
No other reason.

635
00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:07.467
- These people are with the NAACP.
- Oh?

636
00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:09.886
- Reverend Agee.
- How do you do?

637
00:48:10.054 --> 00:48:11.137
How do you do?

638
00:48:11.472 --> 00:48:17.811
Reverend Agee, the black community's
concerned that Mr. Hailey's attorney...

639
00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:20.855
is not sensitive to the needs
of the movement.

640
00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:27.195
The NAACP wishes to provide him
with a new lawyer.

641
00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:33.743
We need to raise funds
to support Carl Lee Hailey.

642
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:37.831
I don't know, Reverend.
Time's awfully tight here.

643
00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:44.045
Obviously, we would expect you
to take...

644
00:48:44.213 --> 00:48:48.216
a modest administration fee
for your troubles.

645
00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:20.832
Your loyalty has been forged
in a baptism of fire.

646
00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:26.379
Rise, knights of the Ku Klux Klan...

647
00:49:27.006 --> 00:49:31.676
and let your brethren never regret...

648
00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:37.891
they believed you worthy of fellowship.

649
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:45.357
Welcome to the Klan.

650
00:49:57.328 --> 00:49:59.120
I need to talk to Jake Brigance.

651
00:49:59.288 --> 00:50:01.581
He's not in. May I ask who's calling?

652
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:05.085
Uh, well—

653
00:50:05.294 --> 00:50:06.336
Mickey Mouse.

654
00:50:06.796 --> 00:50:08.713
- Who?
- Mickey Mouse.

655
00:50:09.507 --> 00:50:11.591
Get out right now.

656
00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:12.759
Who is this?

657
00:50:12.927 --> 00:50:15.679
Get your daughter
out of the house right now.

658
00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.223
Mommy!

659
00:50:18.391 --> 00:50:20.433
- Hannah?
- Mommy!

660
00:50:20.601 --> 00:50:24.020
Hannah? What is it? Oh, my God!

661
00:50:24.188 --> 00:50:26.481
Max! Max, come on!

662
00:50:26.649 --> 00:50:28.024
Fire! Aah!

663
00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:39.369
It's a good thing Hastings
was nearby and got here fast.

664
00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:41.955
The whole place could've burned down.

665
00:50:42.123 --> 00:50:44.708
- Yeah, I appreciate it.
- Take care, man.

666
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.835
See you in the morning.

667
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.301
She asleep, baby?

668
00:50:56.637 --> 00:50:59.889
The Ku Klux Klan
is burning crosses on our lawn, Jake.

669
00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:03.143
Baby, there's been
no Klan around here for years, okay?

670
00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:07.147
This is just a couple of dorks with too much
time on their hands and too many beers.

671
00:51:11.694 --> 00:51:13.945
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

672
00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:19.117
That you weren't home when someone
practically burned our house down?

673
00:51:19.285 --> 00:51:21.911
That you missed supper
and didn't even bother to call?

674
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:25.165
That lately you've become more
interested in getting on the news...

675
00:51:25.332 --> 00:51:27.208
than what's going on with your family?

676
00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:31.212
Or that Hannah comes home bawling
because of kids calling her a nigger-lover?

677
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.466
What exactly are you sorry about, Jake?

678
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.893
Remember the other night?

679
00:51:46.604 --> 00:51:49.147
I told you Carl Lee came by the office?

680
00:51:49.315 --> 00:51:51.691
Remember what we talked about then?

681
00:51:52.151 --> 00:51:54.152
About me calling Ozzie?

682
00:51:57.239 --> 00:51:59.949
You never called him, did you?

683
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.410
You never called Sheriff Walls?

684
00:52:03.412 --> 00:52:05.205
I didn't call him, baby.

685
00:52:06.415 --> 00:52:10.251
Lord have mercy, Jake,
you had a responsibility.

686
00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:12.378
Carl Lee chose you.

687
00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:15.715
He told you what he was thinking.

688
00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:18.301
He told me what he was thinking,
but I didn't know—

689
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:22.764
Jake Tyler Brigance,
we agreed, you were gonna call the sheriff.

690
00:52:22.932 --> 00:52:25.350
Now look at everything
that has happened.

691
00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:29.896
I am sorry to tell you this, darling,
but those two boys are in the ground...

692
00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:33.066
and you were in a position
to prevent every bit of this.

693
00:52:33.234 --> 00:52:34.484
Mama?

694
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:37.487
Are you and Daddy fighting?

695
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:42.742
No, baby. Come here.
Come here, baby. Come here.

696
00:52:43.702 --> 00:52:47.288
Mommy's just upset because
some silly man played a real bad joke, okay?

697
00:52:47.456 --> 00:52:49.415
There's nothing to worry about.

698
00:52:49.834 --> 00:52:52.877
Nothing at all, okay?

699
00:52:58.509 --> 00:53:00.510
What that Memphis doctor say about her?

700
00:53:01.762 --> 00:53:03.388
She's doing good.

701
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:05.932
Her jaw is healing.

702
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.811
She can't run and jump yet,
but it won't be long.

703
00:53:11.105 --> 00:53:12.772
How about the other?

704
00:53:20.823 --> 00:53:23.658
There was too much damage.

705
00:53:24.827 --> 00:53:26.661
She ain't gonna never have kids.

706
00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:37.463
You know, I think about them two boys.

707
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.215
Dead, buried...

708
00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:41.843
probably starting to rot.

709
00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:45.305
And I remember them walking in court...

710
00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:47.390
one proud, the other scared.

711
00:53:49.018 --> 00:53:51.102
I remember how they fell.

712
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:56.316
One on top of the other, and screaming
and squirming and not going nowhere.

713
00:53:58.193 --> 00:54:00.862
God help me, Gwen, but...

714
00:54:02.573 --> 00:54:04.866
that's the only thought
gives me comfort.

715
00:54:08.203 --> 00:54:11.289
They took up a collection for us
at church Sunday night.

716
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:14.375
Some kind of defense fund.

717
00:54:15.127 --> 00:54:17.712
Reverend Agee gave a good service.

718
00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:27.347
We need some money around the house,
Carl Lee, for groceries and bills.

719
00:54:27.514 --> 00:54:28.806
How much you got?

720
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:31.684
Less than 50.

721
00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:35.146
I'll think of something.

722
00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:42.695
How you think you going to get
some money while you stuck here in jail?

723
00:54:42.863 --> 00:54:44.489
Trust me, Gwen.

724
00:54:49.662 --> 00:54:51.454
I just get scared.

725
00:54:53.374 --> 00:54:55.041
Look here.

726
00:54:55.376 --> 00:55:01.172
Tell me exactly what Reverend Agee said
when he passed around the collection plate.

727
00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.550
I don't care.
We are dealing with life and death here.

728
00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:08.680
- I'm gonna have to talk to my supervisor.
- Well, you go talk. Get out of here.

729
00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:11.599
Morning, John.
How are things at the electric company?

730
00:55:11.767 --> 00:55:15.687
The electric company. That is the second
time this week I've had to hold him off.

731
00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:17.689
- How much do we owe?
- Two thousand dollars.

732
00:55:17.856 --> 00:55:20.817
- How much do we have?
- One hundred dollars.

733
00:55:20.985 --> 00:55:24.112
Now, look, this week nothing,
nothing has come in at all. Look.

734
00:55:24.279 --> 00:55:27.198
What about Buck Britt's retainer?
There's 2 grand.

735
00:55:27.366 --> 00:55:30.576
- That check bounced.
- What do you mean, bounced?

736
00:55:30.744 --> 00:55:32.495
It bounced, Jake.

737
00:55:32.663 --> 00:55:35.248
It's been sitting on your desk for a week.

738
00:55:35.416 --> 00:55:37.458
Not that you'd notice.

739
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:42.672
Since you took this case, you—
You stopped talking to your clients...

740
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.632
you don't take your calls, you—

741
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.678
You're obsessed. That's what you are.
You're obsessed, Jake.

742
00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:52.265
- Boy, your obsession is going to break us.
- Hey, hey, hey.

743
00:55:52.433 --> 00:55:55.101
What's wrong, girl?
We've been through hard times before.

744
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:57.186
Oh, not like this, Jake.

745
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.439
Not like this.

746
00:56:00.357 --> 00:56:02.358
We've been getting calls.

747
00:56:02.526 --> 00:56:03.693
At home.

748
00:56:03.861 --> 00:56:05.069
Threats.

749
00:56:06.447 --> 00:56:10.742
You know Bud has survived two strokes.
I don't think he would survive a third.

750
00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:12.118
Why didn't you tell me?

751
00:56:13.579 --> 00:56:15.455
Why, Jake?

752
00:56:15.622 --> 00:56:16.998
Would you drop the case?

753
00:56:22.838 --> 00:56:24.047
Jake Brigance's office.

754
00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:26.799
Until they cut the phones off.

755
00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:29.093
Oh, right.

756
00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:31.054
Okay.

757
00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:34.098
Right. That was Sheriff Walls.

758
00:56:34.266 --> 00:56:36.225
You better get down to that jail.

759
00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.818
What's going on here, Carl Lee?

760
00:56:45.986 --> 00:56:48.071
- I'm Isaiah Street.
- Jake Brigance.

761
00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.406
Uh-huh. Uh...

762
00:56:50.574 --> 00:56:52.658
- I believe you know Reverend Agee.
- Jake.

763
00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:54.994
- And this is—
- Norman Reinfield.

764
00:56:55.162 --> 00:56:57.413
I've seen your picture in the paper.

765
00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:01.000
I assume these boys carry your briefcase.

766
00:57:01.168 --> 00:57:03.836
Just a small part
of my legal defense team.

767
00:57:04.004 --> 00:57:05.379
Pleasure, Mr. Brigance.

768
00:57:05.547 --> 00:57:06.672
Mm-hm.

769
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.217
If this is a party, boys,
where's the chips and beer?

770
00:57:09.676 --> 00:57:13.888
Otherwise, you being here seems a bit
like illegal client solicitation.

771
00:57:14.056 --> 00:57:16.182
With Carl Lee already
having a lawyer and all.

772
00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.101
Well, now, just a minute, Jake.

773
00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.269
Carl Lee invited us here.

774
00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:24.357
Mr. Brigance...

775
00:57:24.525 --> 00:57:26.818
let me be frank.

776
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:30.363
Mr. Hailey's case
has far-reaching ramifications.

777
00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:33.199
Carl Lee's acquittal
for the killings of two white men...

778
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:35.701
would do more
for black people in Mississippi...

779
00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:39.247
than any event since
we integrated the schools.

780
00:57:39.414 --> 00:57:42.583
His conviction, on the other hand,
will be a slap at us.

781
00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:44.877
A symbol of deep-seated racism.

782
00:57:45.045 --> 00:57:47.296
Perhaps enough to ignite a nation.

783
00:57:47.714 --> 00:57:49.882
See how important this case is?

784
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.593
Enter Mr. Reinfield's death squad, right?

785
00:57:52.761 --> 00:57:56.639
It's an unfortunate nickname,
but apropos.

786
00:57:56.807 --> 00:58:00.226
My lawyers and I handle
only capital-murder cases, Mr. Hailey.

787
00:58:00.394 --> 00:58:03.729
Yeah, and of all your cases, Norman,
how many are supposed to be lost...

788
00:58:03.897 --> 00:58:06.524
- ... so you can martyr the victim?
- Now, Mr. Brigance.

789
00:58:06.692 --> 00:58:11.571
How much a defense like that cost?

790
00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:14.157
Yeah.

791
00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:16.617
Would you say about 100,000?

792
00:58:16.785 --> 00:58:20.830
We are prepared to accept
7000 in litigation expenses.

793
00:58:20.998 --> 00:58:24.750
Well, Carl Lee doesn't have $7000.

794
00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:25.960
Do you, Carl Lee?

795
00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:32.091
The NAACP has raised $5000
for Carl Lee's legal defense fund.

796
00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:35.428
And we raised an additional
$2000 from the local churches.

797
00:58:35.596 --> 00:58:37.263
Let me ask you something, Reverend.

798
00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:40.641
How much of that cash
you offer my wife and kids?

799
00:58:40.809 --> 00:58:44.896
Well, that money is to go to pay
for lawyers' fees and stuff like that.

800
00:58:45.063 --> 00:58:47.190
That ain't what you told the church,
now, is it?

801
00:58:47.983 --> 00:58:49.859
You almost cried when you told them...

802
00:58:50.027 --> 00:58:54.238
how my family might starve if they
didn't donate all they could, didn't you?

803
00:58:54.948 --> 00:58:57.658
Well, the money is for you
and your family, Carl Lee...

804
00:58:57.826 --> 00:59:00.786
but we thought it'd be better spent
on your legal defense.

805
00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:03.623
Well, speaking of that defense fund...

806
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:06.292
can I use that for any lawyer I want?

807
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.295
Well, it's not that simple, Carl Lee.

808
00:59:09.463 --> 00:59:12.340
Actually, it is that simple, Carl Lee.

809
00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:17.220
Unless the NAACP wants to go on record
as soliciting funds under false pretenses.

810
00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:20.598
Listen, Carl Lee, we raised that money...

811
00:59:20.766 --> 00:59:23.809
for these men to get you out of here,
not for this cracker to—

812
00:59:23.977 --> 00:59:27.855
Now, hey, hey, hey.
Hold on. Hold on right there, now.

813
00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:31.901
Let me just get this straight here,
Reverend.

814
00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:37.907
If you don't give my wife that cash...

815
00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:41.953
I'm gonna see to it everybody in this
town knows you're a lying crook.

816
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:45.164
I'm sure your congregation
will be interested to know...

817
00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:48.542
Gwen and the kids can't eat
because you want in with the NAACP.

818
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:51.963
That's right.
By the time I get through with you...

819
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:56.008
you won't be able to collect 2 cents
in that collection plate on Sunday.

820
00:59:56.176 --> 01:00:00.346
We'll expect the check for the Hailey family
this afternoon, Reverend Agee.

821
01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:04.684
Reverend Street,
I sure do appreciate your fine work...

822
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.061
but I'm gonna take my chances
with Jake here.

823
01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.482
Thanks for coming down, Mr. Reinfield.

824
01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:15.820
Uh, and we'll be expecting that check
for Jake's legal services...

825
01:00:15.988 --> 01:00:17.989
around the same time this afternoon.

826
01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.828
Good day, men.

827
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.378
Go.

828
01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.383
Go.

829
01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:39.677
Good.

830
01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.056
You set that whole thing up, didn't you?

831
01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:46.100
Couldn't have did it without you, Jake.

832
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.521
Make one hell of a team, Carl Lee.

833
01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:54.400
You out there, Jake. I'm in here.

834
01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:55.901
We ain't no team.

835
01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:22.219
There's trouble.

836
01:01:23.764 --> 01:01:25.598
Oh, lookie there.

837
01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.646
No, here's trouble, Harry Rex.

838
01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:43.157
Hi. You are...?

839
01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:45.034
Roark, meet Mr. Harry Rex Vonner...

840
01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:48.788
the most effective, connected,
morally compromised lawyer in the country.

841
01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:52.249
- Oh. Ellen Roark, brilliant law student.
- Do with me as you will.

842
01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.460
- Looking forward to it.
- Okay.

843
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.797
Um, well,
thought this might interest you.

844
01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:02.343
In all murder trials, it seems the insanity
plea only makes up 1 percent overall.

845
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:05.179
And of the 1 percent of that
that resulted in acquittal...

846
01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:07.306
success rested almost wholly on the—

847
01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:11.852
On the defending psychiatrist regardless of
the quality of the psychological testimony.

848
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.562
- Yeah.
- Shazam.

849
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:14.772
She is brilliant.

850
01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.024
"She." That would be me?

851
01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:19.485
- Now, who else would she be?
- So she would be me.

852
01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:22.363
She is saying that
if I take this plea to trial...

853
01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:26.158
the verdict is going to hinge on whose
shrink the jury finds more credible.

854
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.077
She would be correct.

855
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.079
She would.

856
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:32.706
So are you sure you don't need any help?

857
01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:36.335
I do. I'm hiring. Right now. Me.

858
01:02:36.837 --> 01:02:40.923
Roark, I am sure that I don't need any help.
Thank you, though.

859
01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.008
Okay.

860
01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:46.429
I guess that would just have
to be your loss, then, huh?

861
01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:50.599
Nice to meet you, Morally Compromised.

862
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:51.976
Pleasure's all mine.

863
01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:53.686
She.

864
01:02:57.149 --> 01:03:00.609
Got to love the Lord
for making things like that.

865
01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.362
Sure you don't wanna at least
take a peak at her résumé?

866
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:05.823
Not like you couldn't use the help.

867
01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:10.035
No, I don't want to look at her résumé,
Harry Rex, because I have you.

868
01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.288
- You do?
- Yeah, buddy.

869
01:03:12.456 --> 01:03:15.833
This is your chance to put aside
your shady sources, back-alley deals...

870
01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:19.545
your greedy divorcées,
and do some real law for a change.

871
01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.090
Mr. Vonner, in short...

872
01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:26.886
you now have the opportunity
to work on a case that matters.

873
01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:29.096
Let me get this straight.

874
01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:33.893
You want me to put aside my empty,
soulless, shady...

875
01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.687
astonishingly lucrative,
divorcée practice...

876
01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:40.900
come work with you on an unwinnable,
bleeding-heart, lose-all-my-friends...

877
01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.569
straight-to-the-gas-chamber case
because it matters?

878
01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.070
That is a novel idea, I know.

879
01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:47.490
No way, never,
presumptuous little shit.

880
01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.577
Good night, y'all.

881
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.709
- Hello?
- I need the sheriff.

882
01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:02.213
- He's sleeping now.
- Well, get him up.

883
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:06.091
- Who is this?
- Someone's gonna die tonight.

884
01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.991
- Unh!
- I got him!

885
01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:34.119
- Get his ass, Ozzie!
- What's in the case?

886
01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:46.590
- This thing's ticking.
- What's in the case?

887
01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.093
I ain't saying, nigger.

888
01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:55.182
- Family out of the house?
- Yeah.

889
01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.269
It's locked.

890
01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.483
Now I want you to open that.

891
01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.372
Oh, man...

892
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.792
Defuse it.

893
01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:26.839
I'm gonna take you
and this nigger-lover to hell with—

894
01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:31.176
Ain't nothing more dangerous
in this world than a fool with a cause.

895
01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:34.263
Lay that thing back down there.
Let's get the hell out of here.

896
01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:36.682
Carla loves this house.

897
01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:58.537
- How you doing, Stan?
- Hey, how you doing?

898
01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.497
Come here, girl.

899
01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.584
Mwah.

900
01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:06.712
Daddy, are you coming to Grandpa's too?

901
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.882
Mm-mm. Not this time, baby.
Daddy's gotta stay here and work.

902
01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:11.967
You and your mama
have a good time, okay?

903
01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.595
- All right.
- All right. You be good.

904
01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.263
Go get your stuff down there.

905
01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:19.808
You said you'd withdraw
if it got too dangerous.

906
01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.060
I know.

907
01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.771
But I can't quit now, you know that.

908
01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.941
Carl Lee Hailey's facing the gas chamber,
baby. The man is counting on me.

909
01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.195
I understand that, Jake.

910
01:06:31.363 --> 01:06:33.864
I want you to remember
that we're counting on you too.

911
01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:36.367
What if something happens to you?

912
01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:39.411
Nothing's gonna happen to me, baby.
Come here.

913
01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:41.580
Give me a hug? Hmm?

914
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:43.791
Everything's gonna be all right.

915
01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:46.669
I'm gonna be fine,
you're gonna be fine. Okay?

916
01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.504
Okay, babe?

917
01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:50.756
I promise.

918
01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:56.261
Watch you don't make your wife promises
you can't keep.

919
01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:00.099
Hannah?

920
01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:01.934
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

921
01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.645
Last boarding call.

922
01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:16.073
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

923
01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.950
Come in.

924
01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:19.952
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

925
01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.538
You may come this way.
The judge is upstairs.

926
01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.373
Thank you, sir.

927
01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.466
Judge Noose.

928
01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.636
Thanks for coming.

929
01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:41.849
- Heard you had a little trouble last night.
- Yes, sir.

930
01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:45.060
Makes you wonder about
the sensibleness of taking this case.

931
01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:48.439
This is a beautiful place
you have here, judge.

932
01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:50.149
I'll get to the point.

933
01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:56.155
I've thoroughly reviewed
your brief request in that change of venue.

934
01:07:56.322 --> 01:08:01.410
And I agree with you. I think it's impossible
to find a fair and impartial jury in Canton.

935
01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:06.498
In fact, I think it's impossible to find a fair
and impartial jury anywhere in Mississippi.

936
01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.041
And as such...

937
01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.627
a jury here would be...

938
01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:13.756
as fair as a jury anywhere else.

939
01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:18.343
So I've decided to deny your request
for a change of venue.

940
01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:21.638
Well, I guess that...

941
01:08:21.806 --> 01:08:23.390
gives me something to appeal.

942
01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:26.185
Uh, actually, no.

943
01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:28.687
I spoke to Judge Dent...

944
01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:33.025
and he led me to believe that the
supreme court would uphold my ruling.

945
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.445
You certainly have
covered your bases, judge.

946
01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:42.117
Jake, you're a good lawyer.

947
01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:46.330
You're bright and ambitious. Talented.
You could be somebody around here.

948
01:08:46.498 --> 01:08:50.584
You sure you wanna be known
as the man that defended that murderer?

949
01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.587
Could be very unpopular.

950
01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:56.215
Talk to your client.

951
01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.217
He pleads guilty...

952
01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.928
I'll recommend Buckley
accept a plea of manslaughter.

953
01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:02.346
He'd be out in 20.

954
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:06.099
Yeah. And how's his wife supposed
to raise his family alone?

955
01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:08.602
Better than being a widow.

956
01:09:10.605 --> 01:09:12.231
Think about it.

957
01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:16.276
Why toss away a promising career, hmm?

958
01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:21.657
- Good day, judge.
- Thanks for coming.

959
01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:29.832
All right, Lucien.
Where the hell is this guy?

960
01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.917
Born alcoholic.

961
01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.670
But the man cannot hold his liquor.

962
01:09:34.838 --> 01:09:40.759
Jake, allow me to present
Dr. Willard Tyrell Bass.

963
01:09:40.927 --> 01:09:43.262
Expert witness for the defense.

964
01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:48.183
W.T., this is Jake Brigance, my protégé.

965
01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:54.606
Dr. Bass.

966
01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:01.738
- Are you kidding me?
- No, relax.

967
01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:04.408
When he's sober, he's terrific.

968
01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:09.746
He has his license,
his credentials are impeccable.

969
01:10:13.585 --> 01:10:16.003
- Well?
- I need a drink.

970
01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.963
Three in the afternoon?

971
01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:21.925
- My, oh, my. What would your wife say?
- I am my own man, Lucien.

972
01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.469
- I drink when I want.
- When did she leave town?

973
01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:26.889
- This morning.
- Ha-ha-ha.

974
01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.326
God! Unh!

975
01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:52.915
Bud?

976
01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.048
Oh, my—

977
01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.342
That's enough.

978
01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:11.516
Now, you tell your boss...

979
01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:14.603
next time people are gonna die.

980
01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:20.067
Oh, Bud.

981
01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:23.070
Oh, Bud.

982
01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:48.261
Hi.

983
01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:49.471
Morning.

984
01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:55.227
Nice parking job. Late night?

985
01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.820
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

986
01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.989
So, um, here.

987
01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:11.076
- Oh, thank you.
- Your wife lets you sleep at the office?

988
01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:13.286
My wife left town.

989
01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:15.580
That's too bad.

990
01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:19.918
So listen, I heard that Judge Noose
turned down your change of venue.

991
01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.004
Yeah.

992
01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.882
I think it's time you let me
take you out to breakfast.

993
01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.012
Lunch.

994
01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:35.434
Quit playing with that food.
But, ladies, y'all come back.

995
01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:38.645
- You need to finish that before Christmas.
- Thank you, treasure.

996
01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:42.107
Now, the other night, you said
you're opposed to the death penalty.

997
01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:44.484
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

998
01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:45.986
- You're not?
- Mm-mm.

999
01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:47.988
Actually, I'm very much in favor of it.

1000
01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:51.033
I'd like to go back to hangings
on the court lawn if we could.

1001
01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.744
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

1002
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:57.873
The only problem with the death penalty,
Roark, is that we do not use it enough.

1003
01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:03.670
Well, have you told
your client Carl Lee Hailey this?

1004
01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:05.964
Carl Lee does not
deserve the death penalty.

1005
01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:09.134
- The two men who raped his daughter did.
- How do you decide...

1006
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:10.635
who dies and who doesn't?

1007
01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:15.766
Well, simple. Okay, you take the crime
and you take the criminal.

1008
01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:20.062
Now, say a crack dealer
guns down an undercover cop.

1009
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:22.981
Well, you strap his ass to the chair,
flip the switch.

1010
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.317
For some reason,
I thought you were a liberal.

1011
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.652
Well, I am a liberal, Roark.

1012
01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.698
What I am not
is a card-carrying ACLU radical.

1013
01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:34.618
I do not believe in forgiveness,
nor in rehabilitation.

1014
01:13:34.786 --> 01:13:38.705
I believe in safety. I believe in justice.

1015
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:43.335
I see. Well, let me ask you something.

1016
01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:45.253
Have you ever seen a man executed?

1017
01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:49.132
- Not that I recall.
- Then what I suggest you do...

1018
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.009
is you go watch a man be executed.

1019
01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:54.971
You watch him die, watch him beg, watch
him kick and spit the life out of him...

1020
01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:57.849
until he pisses and shits in his pants,
until he's gone.

1021
01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:01.103
Then you come back here
and sing this crap to me about justice—

1022
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.314
Roark, spare me your Northern,
liberal, cry-me-a-river...

1023
01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:07.526
we-are-the-only-enlightened-ones
bullshit.

1024
01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:10.362
I'm so sorry, yes, you are the enlightened.
Yes, you are.

1025
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:14.407
And that's why you brought me to this
black diner in this black neighborhood.

1026
01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:18.745
So you can convince me you're
this JFK-meets-Jesus-Christ white boy.

1027
01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.038
Is that what it is?

1028
01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:23.083
Or because you're another repressed,
hypocritical provincial...

1029
01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:26.711
who maybe didn't want to be seen
around town with a woman like myself?

1030
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.548
Yes, you sure are enlightened.
You know what?

1031
01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:33.552
I'm terribly sorry, I've made a mistake.
I thought you were one of the good guys.

1032
01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:36.721
Thank you very much for your time,
Mr. Brigance.

1033
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.321
Do it.

1034
01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:55.699
I get a little worked up.

1035
01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.578
Guess that's not the best way
to apply for a job, huh?

1036
01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:06.918
I don't want the jury to see those pictures
of the dead rapists. Can we keep them out?

1037
01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:08.420
No.

1038
01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.424
It is vital that I admit the rape.
I want the jury to know details.

1039
01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:14.801
I'm gonna need briefs on both.

1040
01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:17.804
I don't like your politics, Roark,
but you do have passion...

1041
01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:20.307
and that's something
Carl Lee needs right now...

1042
01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.434
and maybe so do I.

1043
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.604
Are you getting this?

1044
01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:27.939
I'm writing it down.

1045
01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:30.609
All right, here's what we got. It's official.

1046
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.945
The trial of Carl Lee Hailey
will be held in Canton.

1047
01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:38.783
Today, presiding Judge Noose issued
150 summonses for potential jurors...

1048
01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:40.368
in a sealed envelope.

1049
01:15:42.622 --> 01:15:44.456
Now, to prevent tampering...

1050
01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:48.793
that list will be kept strictly confidential
until jury selection begins on Wednesday.

1051
01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.963
No one,
not even Mr. Brigance or myself...

1052
01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:55.592
will know the identities
of the potential jurors in this case.

1053
01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:18.615
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!

1054
01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:21.243
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!

1055
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.329
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!

1056
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.377
Beautiful day, isn't it?

1057
01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.379
There he is.

1058
01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:36.508
- Any word on Bud?
- Ethel's still with him.

1059
01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:38.009
Thank you for coming, sir.

1060
01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.929
Well, well, well.

1061
01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.390
The Pillsbury Doughboy.

1062
01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:45.725
Still practicing exploitative law?

1063
01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.018
Thought you were dead.

1064
01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:49.396
I'm trying. Who do we have here?

1065
01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:51.731
Miss Roark, I would like
to introduce to you—

1066
01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:55.694
Lucien Wilbanks, third white man
in Mississippi to join the NAACP...

1067
01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:58.655
permanently disbarred
by the superior court...

1068
01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:03.034
for attacking police who busted
a picket line in the EPSO oil strike.

1069
01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:05.495
It is a pleasure, Ms. Ark.

1070
01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:10.375
All right, everybody,
jury selection begins this afternoon.

1071
01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:13.962
Now, to win this case, we need
a sympathetic jury willing to acquit...

1072
01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:17.215
and a jury that can use
the insanity plea as an excuse to do so.

1073
01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:18.508
I'm gonna need a drink.

1074
01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:20.218
No drinking.

1075
01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:22.929
What do you mean, no drinking?
It's my building...

1076
01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:26.266
built by my grandfather,
leased to you for a reasonable rent...

1077
01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:27.559
and I want a drink.

1078
01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:31.146
Ms. Ark, I have all the respect
in the world for you.

1079
01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:34.482
I believe in your right to equal pay,
equal work, to bear a child...

1080
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.611
or to abort one. I think you
should be treated just like a man.

1081
01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:40.697
And since you are a law clerk...

1082
01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:42.490
genderless in my eyes...

1083
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:45.368
I think you should be
the one to go buy the beer.

1084
01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:50.040
ERA she-woman, that would be
an excellent activity for you this afternoon.

1085
01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:53.126
Hey. No drinking. Not today.

1086
01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:59.924
Now, ahem, Noose selects
this panel at random.

1087
01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.385
If we get too many bad candidates,
we're sunk.

1088
01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.137
Luck of the draw.

1089
01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:05.430
What you need...

1090
01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:08.433
is young fathers who wanna do
what Carl Lee Hailey did.

1091
01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:11.603
Agreed. I think we need young men
with families here.

1092
01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:15.106
Now, I would prefer no one over 50.
Less bigotry, as a rule, with youth.

1093
01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:18.693
So we stay away from women,
rednecks and old men.

1094
01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:21.029
Uh, citizens, thank you.

1095
01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:24.240
Now, counsel, you each have
12 challenges. Let's begin.

1096
01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:32.624
Your Honor, the state challenges
Jurors Number 6, 10 and 32.

1097
01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:37.796
Your Honor,
the defense strikes Jurors 1, 4, 8 and 2.

1098
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:51.059
Twenty-six, 27, 28 and 31.

1099
01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:55.188
Your Honor, the defense
also strikes Jurors 22 and 29.

1100
01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:04.614
Now that's it, then. Mr. Brigance,
you're all out of challenges. We're done.

1101
01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:13.540
Jurors, you will be sequestered
starting tonight.

1102
01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:15.500
Opening statements begin
tomorrow morning.

1103
01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:20.380
That's a jury of my peers?

1104
01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:23.007
God bless America.

1105
01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.803
My name is Stump Sisson...

1106
01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:30.265
and I'm proud to be a grand dragon...

1107
01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:34.185
for the Invisible Empire
of the Ku Klux Klan.

1108
01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:38.440
What the hell?

1109
01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:42.861
And I'm here to say that
the law-abiding white folks of Mississippi...

1110
01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:49.534
are sick and tired of niggers stealing,
raping, killing and getting away with it.

1111
01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:51.911
Ozzie, let's get them out of here.

1112
01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.330
We demand justice.

1113
01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:57.750
We demand this nigger be convicted...

1114
01:19:57.918 --> 01:20:02.755
and his black ass
sent to the gas chamber.

1115
01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:04.132
Who you calling nigger?

1116
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.553
You pointy-headed, white-faced,
no-good, wife-beating son of a whore!

1117
01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:10.305
Shut up, you wild animal!

1118
01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:13.475
- Animal? You're the damn animal!
- I'll drag your ass out of here!

1119
01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.351
- You're the damn animal!
- Unh!

1120
01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:21.024
Come on!

1121
01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:23.151
Come on!

1122
01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.617
Come here, come here!

1123
01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:42.837
That's right, go on!

1124
01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:59.187
Hastings! Hastings! Hastings!

1125
01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:13.660
What's going on?

1126
01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:24.879
This is for Billy Ray.

1127
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.428
- Open! Open the gate!
- Open the gate!

1128
01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:47.151
Turn around.

1129
01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:54.826
I can't get to this.
Just take off your pants.

1130
01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:57.036
Come on, Roark, do I look that easy?

1131
01:21:57.413 --> 01:21:59.747
Are you afraid
I'm gonna see you in your underwear?

1132
01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:03.334
With Carla gone, the laundry's piling up.
I'm not wearing any.

1133
01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:06.170
It's all right, I haven't worn any in years.

1134
01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:10.341
Look, I'm not gonna watch, I promise.
Now strip, please.

1135
01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:13.636
All right. Fine. Batter up.

1136
01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:18.266
- What I need from you, Roark—
- Do tell.

1137
01:22:18.434 --> 01:22:21.978
—Is a way to discredit the state's shrink,
Dr. Rodeheaver.

1138
01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:24.314
Unless you discredit the shrink...

1139
01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:26.816
Carl Lee does not have a chance. Ow.

1140
01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.026
Mm.

1141
01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.028
Sorry. Sissy.

1142
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.281
I think he's got a very good chance.

1143
01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:37.035
There you go. I think you're gonna live.
All right.

1144
01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.911
Thanks. Whoo.

1145
01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:40.955
Good butt.

1146
01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:46.085
Ugh. So, uh...

1147
01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:48.796
What do you folks do around here
to blow off steam...

1148
01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.174
besides trying to kill each other?

1149
01:22:51.342 --> 01:22:57.430
You got discos or strip bars
or malls or anything to go to?

1150
01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:08.107
Stump's dead.

1151
01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:13.446
He's dead, Freddie.

1152
01:23:15.866 --> 01:23:18.201
Come on, Freddie. Let's go on home.

1153
01:23:18.369 --> 01:23:20.203
It's all over.

1154
01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:24.207
It ain't near over.

1155
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.918
How you doing? Good to see you.
Excuse me.

1156
01:23:27.086 --> 01:23:28.586
Hey, I'll be right back.

1157
01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:30.421
- Here are your mud bugs.
- Mm-hm.

1158
01:23:30.589 --> 01:23:31.839
There you go, darling.

1159
01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.592
- Anything else?
- Yeah, a couple of dinner specials...

1160
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.678
and some fried dill pickles.

1161
01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.055
- You got it, honey.
- Thank you, Sugar.

1162
01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:42.850
That wasn't sexist at all.
Really, I never order my own food.

1163
01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.144
I can't do another shot.

1164
01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:48.398
- All right, fine, I'll take another shot.
- Just a splash.

1165
01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:50.441
Just a splash.

1166
01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:52.568
All right.

1167
01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.654
- To...
- To...

1168
01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:56.114
Carl Lee Hailey.

1169
01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:59.033
May our jury find that man loony
as a proverbial fruitcake.

1170
01:23:59.201 --> 01:24:00.785
Hear, hear.

1171
01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:04.497
No more.

1172
01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:08.334
So, um...

1173
01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:11.671
Do you think he was crazy
when he did it?

1174
01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.299
No, he wasn't crazy.

1175
01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.260
He told me he was gonna do it.

1176
01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:23.808
I tried to tell myself he wasn't serious.

1177
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.981
I think I really wanted him to do it.

1178
01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:35.319
I came home that night and I was looking
at Hannah laying there...

1179
01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:37.363
looking how tender she is.

1180
01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:41.075
All I could think about
was all the monsters out there...

1181
01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:44.454
and any one of them can come steal
her innocence.

1182
01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.168
Take her life, if they wanted.

1183
01:24:57.801 --> 01:25:01.888
Yeah, I wanted those boys dead.
You're goddamn right I did.

1184
01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:10.688
I guess I helped killed them.

1185
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:17.195
So tomorrow, when we get in court...

1186
01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:21.657
it's not just Carl Lee
I'm trying to get off.

1187
01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:41.803
Burn in hell, Brigance!

1188
01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:57.235
Good job.

1189
01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:02.949
- Nice place—
- How is it you'll drive an hour and half...

1190
01:26:03.116 --> 01:26:07.161
outside of town to take me to dinner,
but you have no problem...

1191
01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:09.747
walking me into my motel room?

1192
01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:11.916
Well, with everything that's going on...

1193
01:26:12.084 --> 01:26:14.418
I don't think we can be too careful.

1194
01:26:14.586 --> 01:26:17.129
Just wanna make sure
it's all safe in here.

1195
01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:18.840
I'm not scared.

1196
01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:22.009
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Of what?

1197
01:26:22.553 --> 01:26:24.887
Of what's going to happen tomorrow.

1198
01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:28.391
All the other cases I've worked on
have only been paper defendants.

1199
01:26:28.559 --> 01:26:33.020
It's just I never knew the towns,
and I never touched the lives or anything.

1200
01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:35.314
So I don't know what it's like.

1201
01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:43.614
Tomorrow morning...

1202
01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:47.368
Buckley will try to kill Carl Lee Hailey.

1203
01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:50.371
Now, it's on us to stop him.

1204
01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:52.290
Mm-hm.

1205
01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.126
So tonight,
go over the battle in your mind.

1206
01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:58.296
Argument, rebuttal,
examination and cross. All of it.

1207
01:26:58.505 --> 01:26:59.672
Mm-hm.

1208
01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:02.300
- Remember something.
- Hmm.

1209
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.971
- You are one of the good guys.
- Okay.

1210
01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:11.142
- And good guy has the spicy on her lip.
- Spicy.

1211
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:13.895
But still one of the good guys.

1212
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:28.910
I'm going home.

1213
01:27:29.328 --> 01:27:33.080
Lock the door behind me, Roark.
I'll see you in the morning.

1214
01:27:46.637 --> 01:27:48.679
It's gonna blow, sheriff. It's gonna blow.

1215
01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:54.810
Oz is right over there!

1216
01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:01.609
Wait. Wait. Hold it, Jake. Hold it, Jake.

1217
01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:02.985
- My dog's in there.
- Jake—

1218
01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:04.612
My dog's in there!

1219
01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.821
Max!

1220
01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:08.032
Come on. Come on.

1221
01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.034
Max!

1222
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.746
Max!

1223
01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:21.379
It's too late.

1224
01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:44.318
Move, move, move.

1225
01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:23.691
Hey, buddy.

1226
01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:26.152
Seen my dog?

1227
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:28.070
Looking for my dog.

1228
01:29:28.238 --> 01:29:32.199
Max, come here, boy! Let's go!
Come on, Max!

1229
01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:39.832
I booked you on the 9:15 to Gulfport.
Economy, of course.

1230
01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:41.834
Go see your wife and daughter, Jake.

1231
01:29:44.087 --> 01:29:46.505
What'd you do that for, Harry Rex?

1232
01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:48.632
We got trial in less than three hours.

1233
01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:50.009
Oh, come on.

1234
01:29:50.177 --> 01:29:52.553
Noose would give you a continuance
in a flash.

1235
01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:56.682
NAACP boys be down here before lunch.
Drooling.

1236
01:29:57.434 --> 01:30:00.478
Max, let's go, boy! Come on!

1237
01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:03.189
Jake, listen to me.

1238
01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:07.068
Your marriage is on the rocks,
you're about to have an affair.

1239
01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:10.738
Your career's in ruins if you're lucky,
and if you're not, you're dead.

1240
01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:13.783
Don't get me wrong, my friend.

1241
01:30:14.743 --> 01:30:17.661
What you've put into this case,
you even inspired me, and I'm—

1242
01:30:17.829 --> 01:30:19.872
I'm uninspirable.

1243
01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.749
Do everyone a favor, though.

1244
01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.001
Drop the case.

1245
01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:29.673
No, I can't.

1246
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:32.843
I won't. I'm not gonna quit.

1247
01:30:33.804 --> 01:30:36.263
I quit now, and all this is for nothing. No.

1248
01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:42.603
Max, come on now.
Max, where are you? Come on, Max!

1249
01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:45.147
Max is dead, and you're next.

1250
01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:48.109
Walk away.

1251
01:30:57.869 --> 01:31:00.496
Max. Come here, boy.

1252
01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:03.290
Come here. Come here, boy. Ha-ha-ha.

1253
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.000
Come here. Come here.

1254
01:31:05.168 --> 01:31:07.378
Who's got the goods, huh? Huh?

1255
01:31:09.923 --> 01:31:12.550
Pretrial strategy at my office
in less than two hours...

1256
01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:15.386
and I expect to see your ass there.

1257
01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:18.681
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!

1258
01:31:18.849 --> 01:31:22.184
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!

1259
01:31:30.152 --> 01:31:32.153
Fry Carl Lee.

1260
01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:34.780
Free Carl Lee!

1261
01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:38.868
Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee!

1262
01:31:39.035 --> 01:31:40.244
Free Carl Lee!

1263
01:31:43.165 --> 01:31:45.499
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!

1264
01:31:49.546 --> 01:31:53.174
Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee!

1265
01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:57.803
Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee! Fry Carl Lee!

1266
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:08.397
Now, Mr. Buckley, you may begin.

1267
01:32:08.565 --> 01:32:10.441
Thank you, Your Honor.

1268
01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:15.905
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1269
01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:22.494
You are Cora Mae Cobb, the mother of
Billy Ray Cobb the deceased, are you not?

1270
01:32:22.662 --> 01:32:24.121
Yes, sir.

1271
01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:26.707
And where were you
when your son was murdered?

1272
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.211
I was right outside that door right there.

1273
01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:33.172
Me and Freddie was waiting
for his hearing.

1274
01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:35.674
He was walking up the stairs...

1275
01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:37.635
in handcuffs.

1276
01:32:37.928 --> 01:32:41.513
Can you tell us how old your son was
at the time of his death?

1277
01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:43.974
Twenty-three.

1278
01:32:45.852 --> 01:32:48.020
You say your son was 23 when he died?

1279
01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:49.480
Yes.

1280
01:32:49.648 --> 01:32:52.566
In those 23 years, Mrs. Cobb...

1281
01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:54.860
how many other children
did your son kidnap?

1282
01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:56.820
Objection, Your Honor! Objection!

1283
01:32:56.988 --> 01:33:00.616
Sustained. You—
You are out of order, Mr. Brigance.

1284
01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:03.452
- Withdraw the question.
- The jury will disregard...

1285
01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:05.788
the last question from Mr. Brigance.

1286
01:33:06.665 --> 01:33:10.084
Mrs. Cobb, in your son's 23 years...

1287
01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:12.294
how many other children did he rape?

1288
01:33:12.462 --> 01:33:15.089
Mr. Brigance. In my chambers.

1289
01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:17.508
Court will recess for lunch.

1290
01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:22.930
I don't get it.
Why is he antagonizing the judge?

1291
01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:25.349
He should've known
Noose'd pull him into chambers.

1292
01:33:25.517 --> 01:33:29.770
Of course he knew. Jake got to draw first
blood and he knows that's more important.

1293
01:33:30.897 --> 01:33:32.773
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Rufie.

1294
01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:36.819
- Sweetheart, come play on a winning team.
- How's that impotence thing, Rufus?

1295
01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.033
You're not being paid
for the work you're doing, are you?

1296
01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:44.285
No, sir.

1297
01:33:45.704 --> 01:33:48.122
Well, I guess Jake's paying you
in other ways, then, isn't he?

1298
01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:51.375
Impotence?

1299
01:33:51.543 --> 01:33:53.168
Yep. Girls talk.

1300
01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:58.173
Sheriff, if you would,
will you please identify this weapon?

1301
01:33:58.341 --> 01:33:59.925
It's the weapon found
at the scene.

1302
01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:04.638
And were you able to identify
any of the fingerprints found on this gun?

1303
01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:08.100
Yes. The prints on the gun
matched those of Carl Lee Hailey.

1304
01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:09.727
You're sure?

1305
01:34:10.228 --> 01:34:11.562
Yes.

1306
01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:15.941
Your Honor, I'd like to enter this
into evidence as Exhibit S18.

1307
01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:18.360
We have no further use of this witness.

1308
01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.491
Sheriff Walls.

1309
01:34:25.869 --> 01:34:27.786
Did you arrest Cobb and Willard?

1310
01:34:27.954 --> 01:34:29.455
Yes, I did.

1311
01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:31.665
I arrested them for the rape...

1312
01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:35.753
and attempted murder
of 10-year-old Tonya Hailey.

1313
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.546
And is it true that Pete Willard...

1314
01:34:37.714 --> 01:34:39.506
signed a written confession...

1315
01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:43.344
saying that he and Billy Ray Cobb
did rape Tonya Hailey?

1316
01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:46.430
Objection. That's inadmissible,
and Mr. Brigance knows it.

1317
01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:49.433
Mr. Brigance,
I've spoken to you before.

1318
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:52.436
We are not trying the rape
of Miss Hailey today...

1319
01:34:52.604 --> 01:34:57.274
but the murder of two young men,
and if you continue in this performance...

1320
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:59.735
I'll hold you in contempt.

1321
01:34:59.986 --> 01:35:01.487
Now, is that understood?

1322
01:35:02.489 --> 01:35:04.031
Yes, sir.

1323
01:35:05.367 --> 01:35:07.618
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

1324
01:35:07.786 --> 01:35:09.453
Yes.

1325
01:35:10.622 --> 01:35:12.581
You say something, sheriff?

1326
01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:17.628
- Yes, he did sign a confession.
- Objection, Your Honor!

1327
01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:23.050
Jurors, you will disregard
the last remark of Sheriff Walls.

1328
01:35:23.218 --> 01:35:27.179
Court is adjourned
till tomorrow morning 9:00.

1329
01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:50.369
I'm taking Bud back to Oxford.

1330
01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:54.248
He always missed Oxford.

1331
01:36:11.141 --> 01:36:13.600
I don't know what to say,
Ethel, I don't know.

1332
01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:16.270
There's nothing you can say.

1333
01:36:17.522 --> 01:36:20.691
I know you didn't want
any of this to happen...

1334
01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:22.776
but it happened all the same.

1335
01:36:24.696 --> 01:36:28.115
You wagered all our lives on this.

1336
01:36:28.575 --> 01:36:33.203
You just went ahead and did what you
felt you had to do, no matter what the cost.

1337
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.500
Some folks think that's brave.

1338
01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:41.503
Not me, Jake.

1339
01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:44.339
Now, you may win...

1340
01:36:44.966 --> 01:36:47.843
but I think we've all lost here.

1341
01:36:54.559 --> 01:37:00.397
- Would you help an old lady to her car?
- You don't need any help, Ethel...

1342
01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:05.027
but it would be my honor
to escort you to your automobile.

1343
01:37:19.501 --> 01:37:21.460
Didn't like that one?

1344
01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:23.837
Buckley is presenting
his shrink tomorrow.

1345
01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:27.132
I can't come up with one way
to bring him down. Not one.

1346
01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:31.553
I keep asking myself, "What would
Jake do? What would my father do?

1347
01:37:31.721 --> 01:37:32.763
What would Lucien do?"

1348
01:37:32.931 --> 01:37:35.224
That's your problem right there.

1349
01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:39.269
What you gotta ask yourself is,
"What would Harry Rex do?"

1350
01:37:39.437 --> 01:37:41.021
What would Harry Rex do?

1351
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:42.523
Cheat.

1352
01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.107
Cheat like crazy.

1353
01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:49.613
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1354
01:37:49.781 --> 01:37:52.616
I'll bring her around the side.

1355
01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:56.703
Uh-huh.

1356
01:37:56.871 --> 01:37:58.372
- Hey, Cheryl.
- Hi.

1357
01:38:00.166 --> 01:38:01.667
So we gotta talk about it.

1358
01:38:02.252 --> 01:38:03.544
Now, wait a minute.

1359
01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:06.588
The judge said absolutely
not to discuss this case.

1360
01:38:06.756 --> 01:38:09.299
That judge ain't stuck here
away from his wife and kids.

1361
01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:13.345
The sooner we start talking about it,
the sooner we can get home.

1362
01:38:13.513 --> 01:38:15.973
I wanna get out of here
just as much as anybody else.

1363
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.975
Let's get on with it.

1364
01:38:19.978 --> 01:38:21.395
Undecided?

1365
01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:26.233
Four.

1366
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:28.277
Guilty?

1367
01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:34.825
Seven.

1368
01:38:35.493 --> 01:38:36.535
Not guilty?

1369
01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:43.500
That nigger's dead, y'all.

1370
01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:05.188
I know, I know. Folks in town
just can't get enough of this trial.

1371
01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:09.526
And that's why my editor said I needed
to come down and interview Rodeheaver.

1372
01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:12.446
I'm afraid
Dr. Rodeheaver's in court today.

1373
01:39:12.989 --> 01:39:14.031
Oh.

1374
01:39:14.574 --> 01:39:17.034
If a pretty girl like you
wants to be a reporter...

1375
01:39:17.201 --> 01:39:19.202
maybe she should do
some better research?

1376
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:20.412
Yeah. Ha.

1377
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:23.874
Well, um, you know what?
I don't— I don't mind waiting...

1378
01:39:24.042 --> 01:39:26.543
because my paper really wants
this interview...

1379
01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:28.962
so is he still in Room 369?
I'll just go there.

1380
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:33.342
No, dear. Wrong again. He's in 128.
But he's gone all day.

1381
01:39:33.509 --> 01:39:35.010
You can't see him today.

1382
01:39:35.178 --> 01:39:38.889
You wanna come back to my office
and we can schedule an appointment?

1383
01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:41.183
You know what?
I'll come back another time...

1384
01:39:41.351 --> 01:39:44.102
when he's got time to talk,
when things kind of die down.

1385
01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:46.813
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- You can call me any time.

1386
01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:48.815
Okay. Bye-bye.

1387
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:55.822
Your Honor,
the state calls Deputy Dwayne Looney.

1388
01:40:31.776 --> 01:40:33.276
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1389
01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:36.405
Would you please state
your name for the record?

1390
01:40:36.572 --> 01:40:39.783
Deputy Dwayne Powell Looney.

1391
01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:41.743
Thank you, Deputy Looney.

1392
01:40:41.911 --> 01:40:44.538
You were present at the murders
of Billy Ray Cobb...

1393
01:40:44.706 --> 01:40:46.957
and James Lewis Willard,
were you not?

1394
01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:48.709
Yes, sir. I was.

1395
01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:50.752
If you can remember...

1396
01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:55.132
describe how you were wounded
for the members of the jury.

1397
01:40:55.299 --> 01:40:58.802
I think bullets bounced off the floor,
caught me in the knee.

1398
01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:00.887
And what happened to your leg?

1399
01:41:02.265 --> 01:41:03.557
Doc cut it off.

1400
01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:09.938
And after the loss of your right leg,
Detective Looney...

1401
01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:13.275
are you still able
to serve as a police officer?

1402
01:41:15.194 --> 01:41:17.529
I'm able to perform...

1403
01:41:21.159 --> 01:41:24.661
I'm able to perform a number of services.

1404
01:41:24.829 --> 01:41:27.456
Did you get a good look at the man
with the gun?

1405
01:41:27.623 --> 01:41:28.665
No, sir.

1406
01:41:29.667 --> 01:41:34.838
However, Mr. Hailey did personally
apologize for his shooting me.

1407
01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:38.383
Oh.

1408
01:41:40.136 --> 01:41:43.305
So Mr. Hailey admitted shooting you.

1409
01:41:43.890 --> 01:41:44.931
Yes, sir.

1410
01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:46.975
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

1411
01:41:47.143 --> 01:41:49.060
- Mr. Brigance.
- No questions, Your Honor.

1412
01:41:49.228 --> 01:41:50.687
Wait a minute.

1413
01:41:50.855 --> 01:41:53.356
- Uh, Mr. Buckley?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1414
01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:54.900
The state would like to call—

1415
01:41:55.067 --> 01:41:57.027
Give me a moment
to speak with my client.

1416
01:41:57.195 --> 01:41:58.361
Take your time.

1417
01:42:00.323 --> 01:42:02.574
Ask him if he thinks I ought to go to jail.

1418
01:42:02.867 --> 01:42:05.827
Carl Lee, they amputated his leg
because you shot him.

1419
01:42:05.995 --> 01:42:07.788
He's a witness for the prosecution.

1420
01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:10.040
- You're my lawyer, ain't you?
- Yeah.

1421
01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:12.459
Ask him.

1422
01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:22.886
- Your Honor, one question.
- Make up your mind, Mr. Brigance.

1423
01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:28.183
Deputy Looney.

1424
01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:32.896
Do you think Carl Lee
shooting you was intentional?

1425
01:42:33.064 --> 01:42:34.481
No, sir.

1426
01:42:34.649 --> 01:42:35.982
It was an accident.

1427
01:42:40.404 --> 01:42:41.446
Ask him.

1428
01:42:48.538 --> 01:42:51.498
Do you think he should be punished
for shooting you?

1429
01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:54.042
No, sir.

1430
01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:57.838
I hold no ill will toward the man.

1431
01:42:58.256 --> 01:43:00.090
He did what I would've done.

1432
01:43:00.258 --> 01:43:02.175
What do you mean by that,
Deputy Looney?

1433
01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:04.803
I mean I don't blame him
for what he did.

1434
01:43:04.971 --> 01:43:06.805
Those boys raped his little girl.

1435
01:43:06.973 --> 01:43:11.476
Objection, Your Honor. The witness's
opinion on this matter is irrelevant.

1436
01:43:11.644 --> 01:43:17.357
Your Honor, I believe Deputy Looney
has earned the right to speak here today.

1437
01:43:18.901 --> 01:43:20.068
Overruled.

1438
01:43:21.279 --> 01:43:22.904
Continue.

1439
01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:26.867
Go ahead, Dwayne.

1440
01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:30.328
I got a little girl.

1441
01:43:32.206 --> 01:43:34.875
Somebody rapes her, he's a dead dog.

1442
01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:37.252
I'll blow him away just like Carl Lee did.

1443
01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.628
Objection, Your Honor!

1444
01:43:38.796 --> 01:43:40.964
Do you think the jury
should convict Carl Lee?

1445
01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:43.425
Don't answer that question, deputy.

1446
01:43:43.593 --> 01:43:45.719
He's a hero. You turn him loose.

1447
01:43:45.887 --> 01:43:47.971
Jury will disregard.

1448
01:43:48.139 --> 01:43:49.389
Turn him loose!

1449
01:43:49.807 --> 01:43:52.058
Your Honor, you silence that witness!

1450
01:43:52.226 --> 01:43:54.227
Turn him loose!

1451
01:43:58.649 --> 01:43:59.774
No!

1452
01:44:01.652 --> 01:44:04.863
People say whatever the hell
they want in this courtroom!

1453
01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:06.740
Quiet!

1454
01:44:09.452 --> 01:44:11.828
Any more of that nonsense...

1455
01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:13.622
and you're all out of here.

1456
01:44:15.917 --> 01:44:18.752
Now, Mr. Buckley, you may begin.

1457
01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.962
Thank you, Your Honor.

1458
01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:26.217
Would you please state your name and
occupation for the members of the jury.

1459
01:44:26.385 --> 01:44:30.639
My name is Dr. Wilbert Rodeheaver,
chair of Psychiatry...

1460
01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:32.515
at Mississippi State University...

1461
01:44:32.683 --> 01:44:36.811
and clinical director of the Whitfield
Facility for the Criminally Insane.

1462
01:44:38.147 --> 01:44:41.066
Thank you, doctor.
Your credentials speak for themselves.

1463
01:44:41.233 --> 01:44:45.528
Now, doctor, can you please explain,
as you do so eloquently in your book...

1464
01:44:45.696 --> 01:44:47.864
the McNaughton Rule for the jury?

1465
01:44:48.032 --> 01:44:49.115
Certainly.

1466
01:44:49.283 --> 01:44:50.659
The McNaughton Rule states...

1467
01:44:50.826 --> 01:44:54.996
that a person must be
unable to tell right from wrong...

1468
01:44:55.164 --> 01:44:59.376
and/or be unaware
of the consequences of his actions...

1469
01:44:59.543 --> 01:45:01.753
to be termed legally insane.

1470
01:45:01.921 --> 01:45:03.838
Now, did you examine Mr. Hailey?

1471
01:45:04.006 --> 01:45:07.634
Yes. Mr. Hailey and I spoke
about his childhood, his family...

1472
01:45:07.802 --> 01:45:10.220
his experiences during the war.

1473
01:45:10.388 --> 01:45:12.138
And the rape of his daughter?

1474
01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:17.602
Yes, we spoke at length
about the brutal rape of his daughter Tonya.

1475
01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:21.356
What is your diagnosis
of Mr. Hailey's mental condition...

1476
01:45:21.524 --> 01:45:26.194
on the day that he shot
Billy Ray Cobb and James Lewis Willard?

1477
01:45:26.362 --> 01:45:28.697
At the time of the murders,
his mental condition...

1478
01:45:28.864 --> 01:45:31.074
was without any defects of any nature.

1479
01:45:31.242 --> 01:45:33.076
Mr. Hailey was sane.

1480
01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:35.662
But wait a minute, doctor.
The defense contends—

1481
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:38.915
Why, Mr. Brigance has gone to great effort
to prove to this jury...

1482
01:45:39.083 --> 01:45:42.377
that Mr. Hailey is a nutball.

1483
01:45:42.586 --> 01:45:44.587
Is a slow coach.

1484
01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:48.216
Or what's the clinical definition?

1485
01:45:48.384 --> 01:45:49.926
Insane.

1486
01:45:51.846 --> 01:45:54.097
- Do you disagree?
- Yes.

1487
01:45:54.265 --> 01:45:57.142
Carl Lee Hailey knew very well
what he was doing.

1488
01:45:57.309 --> 01:45:59.811
He slaughtered those men in cold blood.

1489
01:46:00.855 --> 01:46:01.938
Thank you, doctor.

1490
01:46:02.106 --> 01:46:05.150
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

1491
01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:09.571
- Buddy, where the hell is Roark?
- I got no clue.

1492
01:46:09.739 --> 01:46:11.990
Cross-examination, Mr. Brigance?

1493
01:46:13.117 --> 01:46:17.037
Your Honor,
we would request a recess until—

1494
01:46:19.331 --> 01:46:22.417
No, we will not need a recess,
Your Honor, but just a few moments.

1495
01:46:29.008 --> 01:46:30.592
Mr. Brigance?

1496
01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:33.970
When you and Lois Lane are ready...

1497
01:46:37.308 --> 01:46:39.684
Just a few questions, Your Honor.

1498
01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:44.189
Doctor, who do you work for?

1499
01:46:44.356 --> 01:46:45.982
State of Mississippi.

1500
01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:47.358
In your 11 years...

1501
01:46:47.526 --> 01:46:51.154
how many times have you testified
where the insanity defense was used?

1502
01:46:51.322 --> 01:46:53.490
This is my 46th trial.

1503
01:46:53.657 --> 01:46:55.325
Forty-sixth trial.

1504
01:46:55.493 --> 01:46:56.743
Well, of those 46 trials...

1505
01:46:56.911 --> 01:47:00.997
how many times have you testified
that the defendant was legally insane?

1506
01:47:01.165 --> 01:47:03.792
Objection, Your Honor!
The good doctor cannot be asked...

1507
01:47:03.959 --> 01:47:08.129
to recall all of his testimony
at these previous trials. It's absurd.

1508
01:47:08.297 --> 01:47:09.589
Overruled.

1509
01:47:10.591 --> 01:47:12.509
Thank you, Your Honor.

1510
01:47:13.052 --> 01:47:14.511
I can't remember.

1511
01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:17.222
Could it be, doctor, the reason
you can't remember...

1512
01:47:17.389 --> 01:47:20.391
is that in 11 years and 46 trials...

1513
01:47:20.559 --> 01:47:23.770
you never have seen a defendant
whom you have found insane?

1514
01:47:24.105 --> 01:47:26.231
I can't recall at this time.

1515
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:30.235
Can you recall testifying
at the trial of one Dan Baker?

1516
01:47:30.402 --> 01:47:33.738
Objection! Your Honor, this has nothing
to do with the proceedings here.

1517
01:47:33.906 --> 01:47:35.323
Overruled.

1518
01:47:35.491 --> 01:47:39.577
- This... This better be good, Mr. Brigance.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1519
01:47:40.371 --> 01:47:44.833
I'll ask again. Can you recall
testifying the trial of one Dan Baker?

1520
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.838
It's a rather brutal double homicide where
you found the defendant legally sane?

1521
01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:51.840
Yes.

1522
01:47:52.007 --> 01:47:54.592
A dissenting psychiatrist
disagreed with you, doctor.

1523
01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:58.263
And Mr. Baker was found insane
and institutionalized.

1524
01:47:58.430 --> 01:48:00.056
Where is he currently, doctor?

1525
01:48:00.224 --> 01:48:01.266
At Whitfield.

1526
01:48:01.433 --> 01:48:03.560
Who is the chief psychiatrist
at Whitfield?

1527
01:48:03.727 --> 01:48:06.146
- I am.
- You are.

1528
01:48:07.398 --> 01:48:10.233
Dr. Rodeheaver is the chief psychiatrist
at Whitfield.

1529
01:48:10.776 --> 01:48:13.570
Now, help me make this clear
to the jury, doctor.

1530
01:48:13.737 --> 01:48:18.867
In 1985, you testified that Dan Baker
was legally sane.

1531
01:48:19.034 --> 01:48:21.119
The jury disagreed with you.

1532
01:48:21.287 --> 01:48:24.706
And Mr. Baker was found not guilty
by reason of insanity.

1533
01:48:24.874 --> 01:48:28.334
Since that time, he has been a patient
in your hospital, under your care...

1534
01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:31.087
as a paranoid schizophrenic.
Is that correct, doctor?

1535
01:48:31.255 --> 01:48:32.338
Yes.

1536
01:48:32.506 --> 01:48:34.299
Do you normally admit patients...

1537
01:48:34.466 --> 01:48:37.927
keep and treat them for 10 years
if they're of sound mind and body?

1538
01:48:38.095 --> 01:48:39.429
Of course not.

1539
01:48:39.597 --> 01:48:41.973
Then it would be fair to say...

1540
01:48:42.141 --> 01:48:45.602
that you find insane people sane
for the purposes of trial?

1541
01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:48.813
Objection, Your Honor!
This is argumentative!

1542
01:48:48.981 --> 01:48:53.401
Withdraw the question, Your Honor.
No further questions.

1543
01:48:57.907 --> 01:48:59.282
Genius, Roark.

1544
01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:18.593
- Mr. Brigance! Mr. Brigance!
- Yes. Yes.

1545
01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:21.512
How do you expect
to get a fair trial in Mississippi?

1546
01:49:25.059 --> 01:49:26.809
Get him!

1547
01:49:27.853 --> 01:49:30.772
- Get an ambulance, get, get!
- Come on.

1548
01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.662
So is there any news
on the guard who was shot?

1549
01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.748
Ozzie says he's probably paralyzed.

1550
01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:55.046
Some stranger...

1551
01:49:55.214 --> 01:49:57.548
somebody's husband...

1552
01:49:57.841 --> 01:50:00.009
somebody's son...

1553
01:50:00.511 --> 01:50:03.263
put himself in harm's way...

1554
01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:06.724
for me.

1555
01:50:07.768 --> 01:50:10.270
When I saw the blood...

1556
01:50:10.896 --> 01:50:13.690
I got so scared
because I thought that was you.

1557
01:50:22.866 --> 01:50:24.492
Do you want me to stay?

1558
01:50:27.871 --> 01:50:29.455
Yeah.

1559
01:50:30.374 --> 01:50:32.542
I want you to stay.

1560
01:50:36.964 --> 01:50:39.215
So you better go.

1561
01:50:42.803 --> 01:50:44.679
Okay.

1562
01:51:04.742 --> 01:51:06.617
Oh, shit.

1563
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:16.419
Speed limit's 45, not 70, ma'am.

1564
01:51:16.587 --> 01:51:19.255
- Haven't been drinking, have you?
- I guess I just wasn't—

1565
01:51:19.423 --> 01:51:21.299
Let me ask you
to get out of the car.

1566
01:51:21.467 --> 01:51:24.635
- Is that really necessary?
- Just get out of the car.

1567
01:51:25.262 --> 01:51:28.681
Isn't it usually customary to ask
for a license and registration?

1568
01:51:30.059 --> 01:51:32.268
- You bitch.
- No!

1569
01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:34.604
Get her in the car.

1570
01:51:37.024 --> 01:51:39.609
- No! No!
- Come on.

1571
01:51:39.777 --> 01:51:41.527
Get in there.

1572
01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.156
Shut up!

1573
01:52:42.005 --> 01:52:44.924
You can't blame a nigger
for being a nigger...

1574
01:52:45.092 --> 01:52:48.511
no more than you can blame
a dog for being a dog.

1575
01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.765
But a whore like you...

1576
01:52:53.392 --> 01:52:56.394
co-mingling with mongrels,
betraying your own...

1577
01:52:56.562 --> 01:52:59.021
that makes you worse
than being a nigger.

1578
01:52:59.189 --> 01:53:01.482
So I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

1579
01:53:02.192 --> 01:53:04.610
I'm gonna leave you tied up here naked.

1580
01:53:05.571 --> 01:53:08.156
First it'll just be the bugs eating at you.

1581
01:53:08.323 --> 01:53:10.032
One day, maybe two.

1582
01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.618
That sun's gonna be cooking you.

1583
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:14.829
But them animals?

1584
01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:18.875
They're gonna pick up your stink.

1585
01:53:21.587 --> 01:53:24.213
They're gonna come looking
for something to eat.

1586
01:53:25.257 --> 01:53:28.843
Carl Lee Hailey should've shot you too.

1587
01:53:35.017 --> 01:53:37.268
Come on, boys. Let's go.

1588
01:54:12.012 --> 01:54:14.597
No. No. No.

1589
01:54:14.765 --> 01:54:17.058
No. No.

1590
01:54:24.983 --> 01:54:27.068
Shh. It's okay.

1591
01:54:34.826 --> 01:54:35.910
It's okay.

1592
01:54:36.078 --> 01:54:37.620
It's okay now.

1593
01:54:37.788 --> 01:54:39.622
It's okay.

1594
01:54:43.043 --> 01:54:46.379
Mr. Brigance,
you may call your first witness.

1595
01:54:46.547 --> 01:54:51.259
Yes, Your Honor.
Defense calls Dr. Willard Tyrell Bass.

1596
01:54:55.973 --> 01:54:58.432
- Buddy, have you seen Roark?
- Not yet.

1597
01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:05.898
Doctor, would you explain to the jury...

1598
01:55:06.066 --> 01:55:09.860
the effect his daughter's rape
had on Mr. Hailey's condition?

1599
01:55:10.279 --> 01:55:12.405
Tonya's rape caused a relapse...

1600
01:55:12.573 --> 01:55:14.740
a temporary break with reality.

1601
01:55:15.409 --> 01:55:18.452
But yesterday, a Dr. Rodeheaver...

1602
01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:21.664
suggested that Mr. Hailey's
act of calculation was...

1603
01:55:21.832 --> 01:55:23.583
the very definition of sanity.

1604
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.835
That's ridiculous.

1605
01:55:26.003 --> 01:55:29.839
Many of the most famous
schizophrenics are calculating.

1606
01:55:30.007 --> 01:55:31.841
John Hinckley, for example.

1607
01:55:32.009 --> 01:55:33.050
Calculating.

1608
01:55:33.218 --> 01:55:34.719
And legally insane.

1609
01:55:35.053 --> 01:55:37.888
All right, so, Dr. Bass,
how would you diagnose Mr. Hailey...

1610
01:55:38.056 --> 01:55:39.390
at the time of the murder?

1611
01:55:39.558 --> 01:55:43.853
Mr. Hailey experienced a recurrence
of a dissociative condition...

1612
01:55:44.021 --> 01:55:47.898
as a result of the trauma
caused by the rape of his daughter.

1613
01:55:48.317 --> 01:55:51.861
Now, since Mr. Hailey was unaware
of the reality of his actions...

1614
01:55:52.029 --> 01:55:54.405
he could not tell right from wrong.

1615
01:55:54.573 --> 01:55:57.908
Nor could he understand
the consequences of his actions.

1616
01:55:58.076 --> 01:56:01.287
He was, therefore, legally insane.

1617
01:56:02.873 --> 01:56:04.457
Could not tell right from wrong...

1618
01:56:04.625 --> 01:56:07.501
nor understand the consequences
of his actions.

1619
01:56:08.045 --> 01:56:11.005
Therefore, legally, insane.

1620
01:56:11.673 --> 01:56:15.551
Thank you, Dr. Bass.
Your Honor, I have no further questions.

1621
01:56:16.136 --> 01:56:17.303
Mr. Buckley?

1622
01:56:19.097 --> 01:56:21.349
- Mr. Buckley.
- Yes?

1623
01:56:21.975 --> 01:56:23.225
Your witness.

1624
01:56:24.186 --> 01:56:27.021
Oh. I'm sorry, excuse me.
Thank you, Your Honor.

1625
01:56:28.732 --> 01:56:31.150
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1626
01:56:31.318 --> 01:56:36.072
Dr. Bass, could you please
state for the record your full name?

1627
01:56:36.239 --> 01:56:38.574
Willard Tyrell Bass.

1628
01:56:38.742 --> 01:56:41.952
Tyrell Bass. That's a very unique name.

1629
01:56:42.579 --> 01:56:47.500
Now, doctor,
have you ever been convicted of a felony?

1630
01:56:47.668 --> 01:56:48.959
No, of course not.

1631
01:56:49.127 --> 01:56:51.295
- You're certain?
- Yes.

1632
01:56:51.463 --> 01:56:56.092
As certain of that as you are of the
testimony you've just given before this jury?

1633
01:56:56.259 --> 01:56:57.259
Of course.

1634
01:56:57.427 --> 01:56:59.845
So let me understand this now...

1635
01:57:00.013 --> 01:57:02.390
since you are under oath.

1636
01:57:02.933 --> 01:57:07.478
You're telling me, and this jury,
that on October 17th, 1960...

1637
01:57:07.646 --> 01:57:09.980
you were not
convicted of statutory rape?

1638
01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:11.482
Objection, Your Honor!

1639
01:57:13.527 --> 01:57:14.944
Dr. Bass is not on trial here.

1640
01:57:15.112 --> 01:57:17.822
This goes to the heart
of the credibility of the witness.

1641
01:57:17.989 --> 01:57:21.450
- Overruled. Continue, Mr. Buckley.
- Thank you.

1642
01:57:21.618 --> 01:57:23.577
Now, doctor...

1643
01:57:24.788 --> 01:57:26.914
were you convicted of statutory rape?

1644
01:57:27.457 --> 01:57:29.208
You got the wrong man.

1645
01:57:29.376 --> 01:57:30.584
Really?

1646
01:57:30.752 --> 01:57:33.129
I have some mighty interesting
photographs of you...

1647
01:57:33.296 --> 01:57:35.715
taken with a female underage...

1648
01:57:35.882 --> 01:57:39.969
in a motel by the Dallas Police Department
on September 11th, 1960.

1649
01:57:40.137 --> 01:57:45.099
Would you like to look at these images
and see if they refresh your memory?

1650
01:57:47.769 --> 01:57:49.103
No, I didn't think so.

1651
01:57:49.271 --> 01:57:53.065
Your Honor, we would like to enter into
evidence these court and police records...

1652
01:57:53.233 --> 01:57:59.029
showing that on September 15th, 1960,
this man, one Tyrell Bass...

1653
01:57:59.197 --> 01:58:02.742
pled guilty to statutory rape.

1654
01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:05.536
Now, doctor,
I'm gonna ask you one last time...

1655
01:58:05.704 --> 01:58:10.416
were you or were you not
convicted of statutory rape?

1656
01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:14.044
- Well, I can explain—
- Not interested in your explanation.

1657
01:58:14.212 --> 01:58:15.921
Answer the question, yes or no.

1658
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:19.675
Yes. Yes, I was.

1659
01:58:25.974 --> 01:58:27.558
That's enough.

1660
01:58:27.726 --> 01:58:30.019
I have nothing further.

1661
01:58:33.815 --> 01:58:35.858
Redirect, Mr. Brigance?

1662
01:58:38.278 --> 01:58:39.361
None, Your Honor.

1663
01:58:39.529 --> 01:58:42.406
Court will recess one hour for lunch.

1664
01:58:42.699 --> 01:58:45.201
You told me you knew him,
he was a credible witness.

1665
01:58:45.368 --> 01:58:47.369
I didn't know. The record was expunged.

1666
01:58:47.537 --> 01:58:49.663
Buckley really outdid himself this time.

1667
01:58:49.831 --> 01:58:52.416
Damn. Lucien, I was counting on you.

1668
01:58:52.584 --> 01:58:54.668
- And I can't win—
- You wanted this case.

1669
01:58:54.836 --> 01:58:55.878
Well, you got it.

1670
01:58:56.046 --> 01:58:59.715
It isn't easy saving the world
one case at a time, but you stick with it.

1671
01:58:59.883 --> 01:59:03.093
You might just have a knack for it.
Don't do what I did. Don't quit.

1672
01:59:03.261 --> 01:59:05.095
What are you talking about, quit?

1673
01:59:05.263 --> 01:59:07.932
- You're a hero, Lucien.
- Oh, hero, my ass.

1674
01:59:08.099 --> 01:59:11.560
Do you think the world needed me
beating cops' heads on that picket line?

1675
01:59:11.728 --> 01:59:15.648
I was needed here, in that courtroom.

1676
01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:17.066
And I let them push me.

1677
01:59:17.234 --> 01:59:19.443
I gave them an excuse to kick me out...

1678
01:59:19.611 --> 01:59:22.446
and now I can never
plead a case in there again.

1679
01:59:22.614 --> 01:59:24.073
But you can.

1680
01:59:24.241 --> 01:59:25.574
You're an attorney.

1681
01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:27.076
Be proud.

1682
01:59:27.244 --> 01:59:31.372
Your job is to find justice, no matter
how well she may hide herself from you.

1683
01:59:32.874 --> 01:59:34.834
So you go on in there...

1684
01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:36.418
and you do your job.

1685
01:59:37.921 --> 01:59:39.380
Hurry up, now.

1686
01:59:39.548 --> 01:59:41.841
They'll be starting without you.

1687
01:59:46.429 --> 01:59:47.596
Come with me.

1688
01:59:49.432 --> 01:59:50.724
I can't, Jake.

1689
01:59:52.561 --> 01:59:54.270
I love you...

1690
01:59:54.437 --> 01:59:55.563
but I can't.

1691
01:59:56.106 --> 01:59:57.147
You know that.

1692
01:59:57.315 --> 02:00:00.317
I'll never go in another courtroom again.

1693
02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:02.486
And I can't be you, Lucien.

1694
02:00:03.738 --> 02:00:05.948
Don't be me.

1695
02:00:06.116 --> 02:00:08.450
Be better than me.

1696
02:00:10.745 --> 02:00:14.206
All rise
for the Honorable Judge Omar Noose.

1697
02:00:24.092 --> 02:00:26.343
And how did you feel?

1698
02:00:27.012 --> 02:00:29.388
I felt, um...

1699
02:00:32.017 --> 02:00:34.101
I don't know.

1700
02:00:35.687 --> 02:00:38.272
It was like I was outside myself...

1701
02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:40.733
watching myself.

1702
02:00:41.693 --> 02:00:45.779
All the while I kept hearing my baby say:

1703
02:00:46.281 --> 02:00:48.824
"I called for you, Daddy.

1704
02:00:48.992 --> 02:00:55.497
When them men was hurting me,
I called for you over and over...

1705
02:00:55.665 --> 02:00:58.000
but you didn't never come."

1706
02:01:04.174 --> 02:01:06.175
Thank you, Mr. Hailey.

1707
02:01:06.968 --> 02:01:09.678
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

1708
02:01:11.181 --> 02:01:12.723
You have an emergency phone call.

1709
02:01:12.891 --> 02:01:13.933
Mr. Buckley.

1710
02:01:22.317 --> 02:01:24.193
Mr. Hailey...

1711
02:01:25.362 --> 02:01:30.199
before you stepped outside yourself
to watch yourself shoot Willard and Cobb...

1712
02:01:30.367 --> 02:01:34.870
were you aware that if convicted
they might be freed in only 10 years?

1713
02:01:35.038 --> 02:01:36.997
Yes, I heard people say that. Yes, sir.

1714
02:01:37.165 --> 02:01:40.125
Do you think men who kidnap
a child should be free in 10 years?

1715
02:01:40.293 --> 02:01:43.671
- No.
- Think men who rape a child should be free?

1716
02:01:43.838 --> 02:01:44.880
No, sir.

1717
02:01:45.048 --> 02:01:48.050
Do you think two men who hang a child
should be free in 10 years?

1718
02:01:48.218 --> 02:01:50.511
- No.
- What should happen? What would be fair?

1719
02:01:50.679 --> 02:01:53.138
- Objection.
- Do you think they deserve to die?

1720
02:01:53.306 --> 02:01:55.724
- Now, Mr. Buckley—
- Carl Lee don't answer that!

1721
02:01:55.892 --> 02:01:58.852
Yes, they deserved to die
and I hope they burn in hell!

1722
02:02:15.078 --> 02:02:17.830
I have nothing further, Your Honor.

1723
02:02:21.459 --> 02:02:24.294
Summations begin tomorrow.

1724
02:02:26.006 --> 02:02:27.715
Court adjourned.

1725
02:02:34.597 --> 02:02:37.641
Jake, they found Roark.

1726
02:02:59.330 --> 02:03:00.956
- Ellen...
- Hmm.

1727
02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:08.881
Ellen.

1728
02:03:10.467 --> 02:03:12.384
So...

1729
02:03:13.511 --> 02:03:16.180
this is what I had to do
to get you to call me "Ellen"?

1730
02:03:18.808 --> 02:03:20.017
I'm so sorry.

1731
02:03:20.185 --> 02:03:21.977
This is all my fault.

1732
02:03:22.145 --> 02:03:23.479
No.

1733
02:03:23.646 --> 02:03:26.273
Don't sweat it, really.

1734
02:03:27.275 --> 02:03:30.027
They didn't—
They didn't hurt anything that won't heal.

1735
02:03:30.195 --> 02:03:31.862
Nothing.

1736
02:03:33.323 --> 02:03:36.450
Besides, um, Dr., uh...

1737
02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:40.454
What's-His-Name
said I'll be out in a couple days...

1738
02:03:40.622 --> 02:03:41.747
so I'm fine.

1739
02:03:45.835 --> 02:03:47.127
How'd we do?

1740
02:03:49.047 --> 02:03:51.965
Bass turned out to be a felon.

1741
02:03:52.759 --> 02:03:56.470
Carl Lee got trapped on the stand
by Buckley.

1742
02:03:59.349 --> 02:04:02.101
People been terrorized, Roark.

1743
02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:04.019
Beaten.

1744
02:04:05.939 --> 02:04:08.315
Killed. It—

1745
02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:10.651
It's not worth it. It's not.

1746
02:04:13.238 --> 02:04:16.907
It's only not worth it
if Carl Lee goes to the gas chamber.

1747
02:04:20.453 --> 02:04:23.580
Listen, this case is not over
until the summation.

1748
02:04:23.748 --> 02:04:25.791
Remember that.

1749
02:04:26.167 --> 02:04:27.709
Okay?

1750
02:04:29.003 --> 02:04:32.881
And you've got one big fat chance...

1751
02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:34.967
to reinvent yourself.

1752
02:04:35.844 --> 02:04:41.140
To make that jury see this whole case—
This whole case through your eyes.

1753
02:04:47.897 --> 02:04:49.273
And they're good eyes.

1754
02:04:54.737 --> 02:04:57.030
Now, get out of here, go to work.

1755
02:04:59.159 --> 02:05:00.617
I'll keep in touch with you.

1756
02:05:01.035 --> 02:05:02.369
No, you won't.

1757
02:05:02.537 --> 02:05:04.079
Big liar.

1758
02:05:13.965 --> 02:05:16.425
Win or lose, Roark...

1759
02:05:17.802 --> 02:05:19.678
we make one hell of a team.

1760
02:05:21.055 --> 02:05:23.182
We might have.

1761
02:05:24.267 --> 02:05:26.226
We really might have.

1762
02:05:30.523 --> 02:05:33.400
You really want to kiss me right now,
don't you?

1763
02:05:34.986 --> 02:05:37.112
Yes, I do.

1764
02:05:58.968 --> 02:06:00.093
Undecided?

1765
02:06:02.722 --> 02:06:04.348
Guilty?

1766
02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:45.514
Hey, Max. Hey.

1767
02:06:52.689 --> 02:06:53.814
Where's Hannah?

1768
02:06:53.982 --> 02:06:56.608
I left her at Mother and Daddy's.

1769
02:06:58.236 --> 02:06:59.403
How did you get here?

1770
02:07:00.029 --> 02:07:01.405
Drove.

1771
02:07:02.031 --> 02:07:03.532
In the storm?

1772
02:07:05.868 --> 02:07:09.204
Got something to say,
it needs to be said in person.

1773
02:07:13.918 --> 02:07:17.504
The truth is, I've been blaming you
for all that's happened.

1774
02:07:20.425 --> 02:07:23.343
But it's not your fault.
You didn't kill those boys.

1775
02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:30.851
You were trying to make things right.

1776
02:07:33.021 --> 02:07:35.063
I know that now.

1777
02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:43.613
I thought you took this case
because you wanted to prove...

1778
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:46.408
what a bigtime lawyer you were.

1779
02:07:47.201 --> 02:07:49.286
But I was wrong.

1780
02:07:52.915 --> 02:07:55.751
You took this case because...

1781
02:07:55.918 --> 02:07:58.128
if those boys...

1782
02:08:00.506 --> 02:08:05.302
had hurt Hannah
the way that they hurt Tonya...

1783
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:07.387
you would've killed them yourself.

1784
02:08:10.433 --> 02:08:12.142
Baby.

1785
02:08:14.562 --> 02:08:17.356
Baby, come here.

1786
02:08:17.523 --> 02:08:19.358
Come here.

1787
02:08:21.819 --> 02:08:24.154
I love you, Jake.

1788
02:08:25.573 --> 02:08:27.949
I thought I was gonna lose you.

1789
02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:55.310
We're gonna lose this case, Carl Lee.

1790
02:08:57.855 --> 02:09:01.983
There are no points of law to argue here.
I wanna cop a plea.

1791
02:09:03.986 --> 02:09:05.904
Maybe Buckley will cop us...

1792
02:09:06.072 --> 02:09:09.449
a second-degree murder
and we can get you just life in prison.

1793
02:09:11.285 --> 02:09:14.996
Jake, I— I can't do no life in prison.

1794
02:09:15.164 --> 02:09:17.582
You gotta get me off.
Man, if it was you on trial—

1795
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:19.418
It's not me.

1796
02:09:20.336 --> 02:09:21.711
We're not the same, Carl Lee.

1797
02:09:24.632 --> 02:09:27.884
The jury has to identify
with the defendant.

1798
02:09:28.052 --> 02:09:29.803
They see you, they see a yard worker.

1799
02:09:29.971 --> 02:09:33.974
They see me, they see an attorney.
I live in town. You live on the hill.

1800
02:09:34.142 --> 02:09:37.185
Oh, you white and I'm black.

1801
02:09:39.647 --> 02:09:41.356
See, Jake?

1802
02:09:41.732 --> 02:09:43.942
You think just like them.

1803
02:09:45.027 --> 02:09:47.404
That's why I picked you.

1804
02:09:48.406 --> 02:09:51.074
You're one of them, don't you see?

1805
02:09:51.242 --> 02:09:53.577
You think you ain't,
because you eat in Claude's...

1806
02:09:53.744 --> 02:09:58.457
and you're out there trying to get me off
on TV, talking about black and white.

1807
02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:00.584
But the fact is...

1808
02:10:00.751 --> 02:10:03.462
you're just like all the rest of them.

1809
02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:06.590
When you look at me,
you don't see a man.

1810
02:10:06.757 --> 02:10:08.675
You see a black man.

1811
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:12.929
Carl Lee, I am your friend.

1812
02:10:13.097 --> 02:10:14.848
We ain't no friends, Jake.

1813
02:10:16.142 --> 02:10:19.144
We're on different sides of the line.

1814
02:10:19.312 --> 02:10:23.732
I ain't never seen you in my part of town.
I bet you don't even know where I live.

1815
02:10:25.526 --> 02:10:28.570
Our daughters, Jake,
they ain't never gonna play together.

1816
02:10:28.738 --> 02:10:31.114
Now, what are you talking about?

1817
02:10:33.367 --> 02:10:36.578
America is a war...

1818
02:10:36.746 --> 02:10:39.039
and you are on the other side.

1819
02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:43.627
How a black man
ever gonna get a fair trial...

1820
02:10:43.794 --> 02:10:46.796
with the enemy on the bench
and the jury box?

1821
02:10:46.964 --> 02:10:50.425
My life in white hands.

1822
02:10:50.676 --> 02:10:51.760
You, Jake.

1823
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:54.387
That's how.

1824
02:10:54.555 --> 02:10:58.767
You my secret weapon
because you're one of the bad guys.

1825
02:10:58.935 --> 02:11:01.811
You don't mean to be, but you are.

1826
02:11:01.979 --> 02:11:04.272
It's how you was raised.

1827
02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:08.777
Nigger, Negro, black, African-American.

1828
02:11:08.945 --> 02:11:11.071
No matter how you see me...

1829
02:11:11.239 --> 02:11:13.949
you see me as different.

1830
02:11:14.116 --> 02:11:17.452
You see me like that jury sees me.

1831
02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:19.412
You are them.

1832
02:11:20.206 --> 02:11:23.208
Now, throw out your points of law, Jake.

1833
02:11:24.043 --> 02:11:28.296
If you was on that jury...

1834
02:11:28.464 --> 02:11:33.093
what would it take
to convince you to set me free?

1835
02:11:35.513 --> 02:11:38.473
That's how you'll save my ass.

1836
02:11:39.058 --> 02:11:41.226
That's how you'll save us both.

1837
02:11:45.773 --> 02:11:50.277
Is Carl Lee Hailey insane?

1838
02:11:51.153 --> 02:11:53.572
It's a notion so outrageous...

1839
02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:58.076
the only witness
the defense could produce to support it...

1840
02:11:58.244 --> 02:12:00.245
was a convicted felon.

1841
02:12:00.997 --> 02:12:03.623
No. Carl Lee Hailey is not insane.

1842
02:12:03.791 --> 02:12:07.043
This is a man
who is a confessed murderer.

1843
02:12:08.296 --> 02:12:13.133
This is a man who admitted
on this stand...

1844
02:12:13.301 --> 02:12:16.511
to carrying out the sentences
he believed the alleged rapists...

1845
02:12:16.679 --> 02:12:18.680
of his daughter deserved.

1846
02:12:18.848 --> 02:12:21.182
He's taken justice out of your hands.

1847
02:12:23.936 --> 02:12:25.270
And put it in his own.

1848
02:12:26.105 --> 02:12:30.775
And with those hands,
he took the lives of two young men.

1849
02:12:33.863 --> 02:12:36.990
We feel terrible
over what happened to his daughter.

1850
02:12:37.491 --> 02:12:39.242
But feeling terrible...

1851
02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:43.788
and knowing something is wrong
does not give any of us...

1852
02:12:44.290 --> 02:12:45.915
a right to kill.

1853
02:12:47.543 --> 02:12:49.753
Ladies and gentlemen, your duty is clear.

1854
02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:55.550
All in this courtroom know the truth.

1855
02:12:55.968 --> 02:12:59.012
All in this state know the truth.

1856
02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:04.851
Now you need only find the courage
to speak the words:

1857
02:13:05.227 --> 02:13:08.897
"Carl Lee Hailey is guilty."

1858
02:13:09.899 --> 02:13:12.609
Guilty. Guilty.

1859
02:13:14.904 --> 02:13:17.280
State rests, Your Honor.

1860
02:13:33.089 --> 02:13:36.883
Now, I had a great summation
all worked out...

1861
02:13:37.093 --> 02:13:39.636
full of some sharp lawyering.

1862
02:13:40.888 --> 02:13:42.222
But I'm not going to read it.

1863
02:13:43.641 --> 02:13:45.308
I'm here to apologize.

1864
02:13:45.476 --> 02:13:48.937
I am young, and I am inexperienced.

1865
02:13:49.563 --> 02:13:54.526
But you cannot
hold Carl Lee Hailey responsible...

1866
02:13:54.985 --> 02:13:56.528
for my shortcomings.

1867
02:13:57.738 --> 02:14:00.407
But you see,
in all this legal maneuvering...

1868
02:14:00.574 --> 02:14:02.951
something has gotten lost.

1869
02:14:03.119 --> 02:14:05.829
And that something is the truth.

1870
02:14:09.625 --> 02:14:14.129
Now, it is incumbent upon us lawyers
not to just talk about the truth...

1871
02:14:14.296 --> 02:14:18.049
but to actually seek it,
to find it, to live it.

1872
02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:21.261
My teacher taught me that.

1873
02:14:23.681 --> 02:14:25.640
Let's take Dr. Bass, for example.

1874
02:14:26.267 --> 02:14:29.644
Obviously, I would've never knowingly
put a convicted felon on the stand.

1875
02:14:29.812 --> 02:14:31.229
I hope you can believe that.

1876
02:14:31.689 --> 02:14:33.148
But what is the truth?

1877
02:14:33.315 --> 02:14:36.234
That— That he's a disgraced liar?

1878
02:14:36.402 --> 02:14:38.319
What if I told you...

1879
02:14:38.487 --> 02:14:42.157
that the woman he was accused
of raping was 17, he was 23...

1880
02:14:42.324 --> 02:14:45.201
that she later became his wife,
bore his child...

1881
02:14:45.369 --> 02:14:46.995
and is still married to the man?

1882
02:14:47.163 --> 02:14:51.166
Does that make his testimony
more or less true?

1883
02:14:55.463 --> 02:14:57.255
What is it in us that seeks the truth?

1884
02:14:58.841 --> 02:15:00.759
Is it our minds?

1885
02:15:01.385 --> 02:15:02.886
Or is it our hearts?

1886
02:15:06.766 --> 02:15:10.143
I set out to prove a black man
could receive a fair trial in the South...

1887
02:15:10.311 --> 02:15:13.480
that we are all equal
in the eyes of the law.

1888
02:15:15.191 --> 02:15:16.775
That's not the truth.

1889
02:15:16.942 --> 02:15:19.194
Because the eyes of the law
are human eyes...

1890
02:15:19.361 --> 02:15:23.323
yours and mine,
and until we can see each other as equals...

1891
02:15:23.491 --> 02:15:25.825
justice is never going to be
evenhanded.

1892
02:15:25.993 --> 02:15:29.829
It will remain nothing more than
a reflection of our own prejudices.

1893
02:15:30.122 --> 02:15:32.540
So until that day...

1894
02:15:32.708 --> 02:15:35.960
we have a duty under God
to seek the truth...

1895
02:15:37.838 --> 02:15:39.964
not with our eyes,
and not with our minds...

1896
02:15:40.132 --> 02:15:43.718
where fear and hate turn
commonality into prejudice...

1897
02:15:43.886 --> 02:15:46.095
but with our hearts...

1898
02:15:46.388 --> 02:15:48.723
where we don't know better.

1899
02:15:53.062 --> 02:15:55.480
I wanna tell you a story.

1900
02:15:57.233 --> 02:15:59.943
And I ask you all to close your eyes...

1901
02:16:01.570 --> 02:16:03.822
while I tell you this story.

1902
02:16:07.284 --> 02:16:11.162
I want you to listen to me.
I want you to listen to yourselves.

1903
02:16:15.209 --> 02:16:18.127
Go ahead. Close your eyes, please.

1904
02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:26.094
This is a story about a little girl...

1905
02:16:27.012 --> 02:16:30.765
walking home from the grocery store
one sunny afternoon.

1906
02:16:32.101 --> 02:16:34.185
I want you to picture this little girl.

1907
02:16:37.606 --> 02:16:40.024
Suddenly, a truck races up.

1908
02:16:41.777 --> 02:16:43.361
Two men jump out and grab her.

1909
02:16:45.990 --> 02:16:49.117
Drag her into a nearby field...

1910
02:16:51.996 --> 02:16:53.371
and they tie her up.

1911
02:16:57.251 --> 02:16:59.252
And they rip her clothes from her body.

1912
02:17:02.089 --> 02:17:04.382
Now they climb on.

1913
02:17:05.259 --> 02:17:07.468
First one, then the other.

1914
02:17:09.471 --> 02:17:10.555
Raping her.

1915
02:17:15.519 --> 02:17:20.481
Shattering everything innocent and pure
with a vicious thrust...

1916
02:17:21.483 --> 02:17:24.861
in a fog of drunken breath and sweat.

1917
02:17:28.782 --> 02:17:30.700
And when they're done...

1918
02:17:31.827 --> 02:17:34.913
after they've killed her tiny womb...

1919
02:17:37.082 --> 02:17:40.376
murdered any chance
for her to bear children...

1920
02:17:40.544 --> 02:17:43.212
to have life beyond her own...

1921
02:17:46.675 --> 02:17:48.801
they decide to use her
for target practice.

1922
02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:54.849
So they start throwing
full beer cans at her.

1923
02:17:56.852 --> 02:17:59.187
They throw them so hard...

1924
02:17:59.855 --> 02:18:03.316
that it tears the flesh
all the way to her bones.

1925
02:18:09.490 --> 02:18:11.115
Then they urinate on her.

1926
02:18:15.871 --> 02:18:17.246
Now comes the hanging.

1927
02:18:22.419 --> 02:18:24.253
They have a rope.

1928
02:18:25.547 --> 02:18:27.382
They tie a noose.

1929
02:18:28.550 --> 02:18:31.886
Imagine the noose coiling
tight around her neck...

1930
02:18:32.429 --> 02:18:35.056
and a sudden blinding jerk.

1931
02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:39.018
She's pulled into the air
and her feet and legs go kicking...

1932
02:18:39.186 --> 02:18:40.937
They don't find the ground.

1933
02:18:43.107 --> 02:18:44.983
The hanging branch...

1934
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:47.110
isn't strong enough.

1935
02:18:48.779 --> 02:18:51.406
It snaps and she falls...

1936
02:18:51.782 --> 02:18:53.116
back to the earth.

1937
02:18:57.121 --> 02:18:59.122
So they pick her up...

1938
02:19:00.249 --> 02:19:02.583
throw her in the back of the truck...

1939
02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:07.588
drive out to Foggy Creek Bridge...

1940
02:19:08.424 --> 02:19:09.799
pitch her over the edge.

1941
02:19:13.012 --> 02:19:17.890
And she drops some 30 feet
down to the creek bottom below.

1942
02:19:25.399 --> 02:19:27.275
Can you see her?

1943
02:19:31.071 --> 02:19:32.739
Her raped...

1944
02:19:32.906 --> 02:19:34.657
beaten...

1945
02:19:34.825 --> 02:19:37.035
broken body...

1946
02:19:40.122 --> 02:19:42.498
soaked in their urine...

1947
02:19:43.125 --> 02:19:45.460
soaked in their semen...

1948
02:19:47.463 --> 02:19:49.297
soaked in her blood.

1949
02:19:50.299 --> 02:19:52.175
Left to die.

1950
02:19:55.179 --> 02:19:57.055
Can you see her?

1951
02:20:01.060 --> 02:20:03.311
I want you to picture...

1952
02:20:05.105 --> 02:20:07.023
that little girl.

1953
02:20:25.751 --> 02:20:27.585
Now imagine she's white.

1954
02:20:49.733 --> 02:20:51.526
The defense rests, Your Honor.

1955
02:21:21.890 --> 02:21:23.474
Innocent! He's innocent!

1956
02:21:23.642 --> 02:21:25.226
Innocent! He's innocent!

1957
02:21:25.394 --> 02:21:26.561
Hailey's innocent!

1958
02:21:34.236 --> 02:21:35.361
He's innocent!

1959
02:21:45.873 --> 02:21:47.707
We won! We won!

1960
02:21:47.875 --> 02:21:50.126
Ellen, we won! Aren't you happy?

1961
02:21:50.294 --> 02:21:56.132
Oh, my God, Ellen, you have to be happy.
He's innocent. Carl Lee is innocent.

1962
02:21:57.509 --> 02:21:58.843
He's coming home.

1963
02:21:59.011 --> 02:22:00.303
Jake.

1964
02:22:01.597 --> 02:22:03.431
That was...

1965
02:22:04.141 --> 02:22:05.975
That was...

1966
02:22:07.186 --> 02:22:09.520
Hey, I'm one of the bad guys, remember?

1967
02:22:12.149 --> 02:22:15.443
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

1968
02:22:25.162 --> 02:22:27.413
Freddie Lee Cobb!

1969
02:22:30.125 --> 02:22:32.543
We got something to talk about.

1970
02:22:32.711 --> 02:22:34.253
Hastings...

1971
02:22:34.421 --> 02:22:37.006
you belong over there with them.

1972
02:22:38.634 --> 02:22:40.468
Get over.

1973
02:22:52.147 --> 02:22:54.023
Congratulations, counselor.

1974
02:22:54.191 --> 02:22:55.816
Thank you.

1975
02:23:17.256 --> 02:23:19.548
You must be overwhelmed right now.

1976
02:23:48.704 --> 02:23:50.788
- Give me—
- After you—

1977
02:23:50.956 --> 02:23:52.331
Yeah.

1978
02:23:55.127 --> 02:23:57.253
- Was I good or what?
- All right.

1979
02:23:57.421 --> 02:24:00.548
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

1980
02:24:08.098 --> 02:24:09.432
Here you go.

1981
02:24:09.599 --> 02:24:13.144
- Carl Lee. Look.
- What?

1982
02:24:37.044 --> 02:24:38.544
Well.

1983
02:24:38.712 --> 02:24:39.754
Hello.

1984
02:24:39.921 --> 02:24:41.005
- Hi.
- Hi there.

1985
02:24:41.173 --> 02:24:42.590
Hannah, this is Miss Hailey.

1986
02:24:42.758 --> 02:24:43.799
- This is Hannah.
- Hi.

1987
02:24:43.967 --> 02:24:46.927
- Hi, Hannah. Ain't she so pretty.
- Thank you.

1988
02:24:47.095 --> 02:24:49.722
- Brought you some peach cobbler.
- Oh, thank you.

1989
02:24:49.890 --> 02:24:51.766
Come on in. Come in.

1990
02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:55.186
Howdy.

1991
02:25:04.946 --> 02:25:07.365
Hannah, this is my daughter, Tonya.

1992
02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:10.701
- Hi, Tonya.
- Hi, nice to meet you, Hannah.

1993
02:25:14.247 --> 02:25:16.332
Just thought our kids
could play together.
