What?
He almost just ran me over.

26
00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:29.123
You shouldn't get out that side.

27
00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:32.193
Go out that side. Hey, honey,
did you get the list Ms.Collier?

28
00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:33.861
- I've already done it.
- Great.

29
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:35.229
- Of course.
- Really?

30
00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.697

Emma loved this book."

I have a showing at 5.
I'll be home around 6.

Bye, sweetie. I love you.

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:51.279
She's the perfect girl,
and I'm the bad sister.

37
00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:53.381
No, you're not.
Have a great day, honey.

38
00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.885
Breathe, Em. They're gonna
talk about stuff we know.

39
00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:00.588
I'm only going
to get out of first period.

40
00:02:00.588 --> 00:02:02.856
- We can be a little late.
- Not really.

41
00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:07.094
Oh, my dog, you're going to
explode if you stay this tight.

42
00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:10.531
Speaking of tight...

43
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.266
Hey, Emma.

44
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.635
"Hey, Emma"?

45
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:17.171
- He fricking knows your name.
- I guess.

46
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:18.839
Stephen Sullivan knows your name.

47
00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:23.711
- Can we go to class now, please?
- Will you sleep with him? For me.

48
00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:26.747
Listen up, everybody.

49
00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:29.850
The bus will be leaving
at 7 a.m. sharp tomorrow,

50
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.853
so be on time.
Otherwise...

51
00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:35.356
Whoa. Sorry, prom queen.

52
00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:37.491
- Find a seat. Let's go.
- What?

53
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.293
I expect it from Mr. McMullen,

54
00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:41.262
but I'd hope better from you, Emma.

55
00:02:41.262 --> 00:02:43.464
- Sorry, Mr. Christiansen.
- All right.

56
00:02:43.464 --> 00:02:47.935
So tomorrow the bus will be
leaving at 7 a.m. sharp.

57
00:02:47.935 --> 00:02:52.072
Be on time or the bus
will be leaving without you.

58
00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:56.810
How'd Lonely Boy get this trip?
Daddy probably bought his way.

59
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.314
- What?
- You know I can hear you, right?

60
00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:02.283
For the first five days,

61
00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:06.287
we'll be helping to renovate
a school with Project Humanity.

62
00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:09.122
The last three days,
we'll be exploring the island

63
00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.592
and going on cultural excursions,

64
00:03:11.592 --> 00:03:14.495
and it should be a lot of fun.

65
00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:21.302
So headline:
Stephen knows Emma's name.

66
00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:24.405
- Say what?
- I'll trade you for your burger.

67
00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:26.607
- You can have it.
- You sure?

68
00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:29.910
- Yeah, I just wanted the fries.
- Okay, so Emma and Stephen?

69
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.812
- I kind of like that.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:34.548
We have one week on the island
to work our magic

71
00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:37.418
and get Emma here
laid by the quarterback.

72
00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:39.753
- Do I have a say in this?
- No, not at all.

73
00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:43.090
- We're there to help people.
- I'm trying to "help" you.

74
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.993
We have jobs to do.
I have looked at the itinerary.

75
00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:48.562
- You made the itinerary.
- Ha, ha, ha.

76
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:51.665
The school has every day
and night planned.

77
00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.468
So? We'll change the plans.
That's life, right?

78
00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:56.704
Oh, and BT-dubs,
I just found out

79
00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:59.239
carnival in Trinidad
is when we're there.

80
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.242
Oh, my God.
I have to get a new bathing suit.

81
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.178
- Really?
- What?

82
00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:07.348
Emma's scoping Lonely Boy.

83
00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:09.116
He was in my middle school.

84
00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.852
- He used to be really nice.
- Yeah, used to be.

85
00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:15.055
I heard he got kicked out
of the last school he was in.

86
00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.657
No. I think he's kind of cute,

87
00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:19.660
in a Rebel Without a Cause,
Holden Caulfield kind of way.

88
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.295
Let me make it simple.

89
00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:23.431
Girls like our Em don't hook up

90
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:25.466
with freaks like what's-his-face,

91
00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:27.968
especially when
she's got the quarterback.

92
00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:29.236
You can hand me that.

93
00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:30.704
- Busted!
- Loser.

94
00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:33.907
- To the principal's.
- Lead the way.

95
00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:37.277
- Oh, yeah.
- Whoo.

96
00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.580
- Way to go, pal.
- Well done.

97
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.749
Looks like someone's
not going on the trip.

98
00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:46.754
<i>It looks like we're in for another...</i>

99
00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:49.723
Wow, how long you planning on staying?

100
00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:52.726
- You can never be too prepared.
- Ah.

101
00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.862
Thank you, guys, so much
for letting me go.

102
00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:57.765
No worries, sweetie.
So I had to take a second mortgage out

103
00:04:57.765 --> 00:05:00.133
and Mom has to sell an extra mansion.

104
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.635
Shh. Don't tell her that.

105
00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.773
Oh.

106
00:05:05.773 --> 00:05:07.941
- I love our kids so much.
- Heh, heh, heh.

107
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:10.778
If this is what you're like
for an eight-day trip,

108
00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:13.414
what's it gonna be like
to send her to college?

109
00:05:13.414 --> 00:05:14.848
I know.

110
00:05:14.848 --> 00:05:18.486
I'm thinking we have to move
to Princeton with you.

111
00:05:18.486 --> 00:05:21.088
- I support that idea.
- Right?

112
00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:22.990
- Wouldn't you love that?
- Hm.

113
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.593
What are you talking about,
you don't wanna go?

114
00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:28.696
Know what strings I had to pull
to get you on this trip?

115
00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:30.964
For who, Dad,
me or you?

116
00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.567
I don't even wanna go
on this stupid trip.

117
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:35.536
I'm gonna be forced
to hang with people

118
00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.070
I never talk to anyway.

119
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.073
It's an opportunity, son.

120
00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:45.379
It's a chance to do something
for someone other than yourself.

121
00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:49.049
Can we go?
We're gonna be late.

122
00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:50.451
I'd be stuck here,

123
00:05:50.451 --> 00:05:52.586
and you'd have to
look at my face all week.

124
00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:59.026
Let's go, gang.
All aboard!

125
00:05:59.026 --> 00:06:01.395
- Be careful.
- Emma, Lizzie.

126
00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:04.432
- Be safe. Love you.
<i>- Let's get a move.</i>

127
00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:05.633
Come on.

128
00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:09.302
Dean, be safe.

129
00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:11.772
Will do, Father.

130
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:20.481
How you doing, Emma?
Crazy early, right?

131
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:21.915
- Heh, heh.
- Heh.

132
00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:24.618
That was two sentences.
He's upping his game.

133
00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:26.086
You are so getting laid.

134
00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:40.934
Okay, everybody, listen up.
Project starts tomorrow.

135
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:43.370
We have a few hours today
to get settled in

136
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.905
and hang by the pool,
if you want.

137
00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:47.007
Then we're all
gonna go have dinner.

138
00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.678
What'd I tell you, Em?
Screw your schedule.

139
00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:53.881
This is gonna be the best ever.

140
00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:09.897
Hm. No locals. Damn.

141
00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:13.567
Oh, well.
Who's the lucky boy?

142
00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:14.835
Don't worry, Em.

143
00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:18.005
I'm not gonna steal
your quarterback.

144
00:07:18.005 --> 00:07:22.209
All right, ladies.
Let's do this.

145
00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:23.611

146
00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.015
Yeah, ladies.

00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:38.125
Ah! Don't splash me.

148
00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:45.699

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.737
- Get a good night's sleep.
- Love you. Bye.

173
00:08:56.737 --> 00:08:58.205
- Bye, honey.
- Good night.

174
00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:00.307
I'm downstairs buying toothpaste

175
00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:03.276
because I ran out.
Can you believe they charge...?

176
00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:04.544
- Losing.
- Okay.

177
00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.479
Headline: Carnival party tonight

178
00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:09.783
on some local dude's boat.
I know. And Stephen invited us,

179
00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:12.252
and he singled you out,
young Emma.

180
00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:15.756
They're leaving right now,
but the boat leaves in a half-hour.

181
00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:17.925
- I don't know.
- Shut it.

182
00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:19.860
We are going.
You are going,

183
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.896
even if I have to tie you up
and drag you to the boat.

184
00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.232
Seriously, we'll be done by midnight.

185
00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.500
Two o'clock, the latest.

186
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.003
- Okay.
- Yeah!

187
00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:31.705
Carnival!

188
00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:34.041
Whoo!

189
00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:37.845
Thank you.

190
00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.115
Want a taxi?

191
00:09:47.287 --> 00:09:50.523
Whoo! Go.

192
00:09:50.523 --> 00:09:54.461
Carnival, bitches!

193
00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:56.964
Hurry, we're gonna miss it.

194
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.069
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

195
00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:05.205
- Don't leave.
- Run for it.

196
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:14.715
♪ Shorty wanna move
♪ Shorty wanna rock

197
00:10:14.715 --> 00:10:18.118
♪ Shorty wanna dance
♪ Like it's never gonna stop

198
00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.188
♪ 'Cause tonight
♪ We're gonna put it on blast

199
00:10:21.188 --> 00:10:23.390
This is so fun.

200
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.393
- Hey, ladies, what's up?
- Oh, no, that's okay.

201
00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:28.395
♪ Shorty wanna rock

202
00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:32.165
♪ Shorty wanna dance
♪ Like it's never gonna stop

203
00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:36.603
Okay, let's get a cocktail
and find your man.

204
00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.172
- Not my man and not drinking.
- Ugh.

205
00:10:39.172 --> 00:10:42.642
Em, you've gotta loosen up.
Switch it around.

206
00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.712
Get out of your element just a little.

207
00:10:44.712 --> 00:10:46.046
I like my element.

208
00:10:55.022 --> 00:10:57.090
I'm gonna go find Helen.

209
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.549
Is that your new boyfriend?

210
00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:24.451
What's it to you?

211
00:11:26.086 --> 00:11:27.955
<i>Monte Carlo.</i>

212
00:11:30.724 --> 00:11:32.960
<i>Monte Carlo.</i>

213
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.862
<i>Prepare to be boarded.</i>

214
00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:39.967
<i>Monte Carlo,
this is the Trinidad Police.</i>

215
00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:43.603
<i>Heave to
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

216
00:11:43.603 --> 00:11:46.907
<i>Move to the front of the boat.</i>

217
00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:49.877
<i>Move to the bow of the boat.</i>

218
00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:52.079
Aah!

219
00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:54.614
<i>Monte Carlo,
this is the Trinidad Police.</i>

220
00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:56.884
- Emma!
- Help!

221
00:11:56.884 --> 00:11:58.551
<i>This is the Trinidad Police.</i>

222
00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.188
- What are you doing?
- I fell.

223
00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:04.324
Where's Emma?
I thought she was with you.

224
00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:05.458
Climb up.

225
00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:13.867
- You all right?
- Just great.

226
00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:15.803
What are you doing?

227
00:12:15.803 --> 00:12:18.371
I'm in enough trouble.
I can't get busted.

228
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:20.307
You crazy?
We'll dodge the cops?

229
00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:21.441
We'll be fine.

230
00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:23.576
We'll go to the hotel
when things cool down.

231
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:27.014
On this?
I wanna get back on the boat.

232
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.222
They're getting too far away.

233
00:12:35.222 --> 00:12:37.490
We'll hang back and follow them.

234
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.192
- We'll be fine.
- Hurry.

235
00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:40.994
We won't be able to see the boat.

236
00:12:40.994 --> 00:12:43.596
- How we gonna get out of here?
- I'm working on it.

237
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:47.334
- You know which way to go?
- Be quiet. Let me think.

238
00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:48.568
Damn it, no motor.

239
00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:51.004
No motor?
What now, genius?

240
00:12:51.004 --> 00:12:52.539
I don't know.

241
00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:54.607
What do you mean,
you don't know?

242
00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:58.645
We're stuck out here.
This isn't some stupid thing...

243
00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:00.347
- Aah!
- Hold on.

244
00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:05.418
Put your suitcases by the door

245
00:13:05.418 --> 00:13:08.922
to be loaded into the awaiting cabs.

246
00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:10.423
I'd like to thank those of you

247
00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:14.094
who brought this unique
opportunity to an abrupt end.

248
00:13:14.094 --> 00:13:16.396
Welcome, gentlemen.
Glad you could make it.

249
00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:18.598
Too bad you're on your way home.

250
00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:20.868
Ms. Collier,
Emma's not here.

251
00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:24.004
- What?
- Um...

252
00:13:24.004 --> 00:13:25.805
She never came home last night.

253
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.240
I didn't tell anyone

254
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.709
because I thought
she was with someone, but...

255
00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:32.379
Okay, well, how do you know
that she's not?

256
00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:34.747
You know her.
She wouldn't just bail.

257
00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:36.116
She has a schedule to keep.

258
00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:38.285
I tried her cell.
She's not answering.

259
00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:40.921
All right, well,
where did you see her last?

260
00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:42.655
- Um...
- Ahem.

261
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.524
On the boat.

262
00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:57.170
How far do you think
we've drifted?

263
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.939
I don't know.
Keep an eye out.

264
00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:00.473
Can't be that far.

265
00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:02.275
We've been out here for hours.

266
00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:04.311
Was this part of your brilliant plan?

267
00:14:10.017 --> 00:14:12.752
I can't believe my phone got soaked.

268
00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:14.787
Yeah, I can't believe that either.

269
00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.589
Try your phone again.

270
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:19.326
I told you, I'm not getting
reception out here.

271
00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:23.463
You want some more water?

272
00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:25.165
Thanks.

273
00:14:30.503 --> 00:14:32.906
I can't believe
you brought water to a party.

274
00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.707
I didn't wanna get dehydrated.

275
00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.009
That gives you a hangover.

276
00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.578
Really? I thought it was the tequila.

277
00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:43.850
I still can't believe there's no motor.

278
00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.486
I mean. That's the point of the dinghy.
For emergencies.

279
00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:50.423
Why else have the dinghy? What?
How is that funny?

280
00:14:50.423 --> 00:14:53.961
"Dinghy's" funny.
It's a funny word. "Dinghy."

281
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:56.096
We're floating in the Caribbean.

282
00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.697
You know that, right?

283
00:14:57.697 --> 00:14:59.232
Yeah.

284
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.801
I also know freaking out
isn't gonna make us

285
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:03.971
any less screwed, so...

286
00:15:03.971 --> 00:15:06.673
So, what do we do?

287
00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:12.412
For now,
we float, I guess.

288
00:15:12.412 --> 00:15:14.014
Oh.

289
00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:16.049
Want some gum?

290
00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:17.717
Why, is my breath bad?

291
00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:19.386
Probably.

292
00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:29.529
- Elizabeth Kover.
- Here.

293
00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:31.498
Samuel Leifer.

294
00:15:31.498 --> 00:15:32.499
Here.

295
00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:35.535
Dean McMullen.

296
00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:39.572
Dean? Dean McMullen?
Anyone seen Dean?

297
00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:44.077
Hoo!

298
00:15:46.246 --> 00:15:48.415
You should try that.

299
00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:49.416
No, thanks.

300
00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:51.951
You want me to get your back?

301
00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:57.957
- What's with all the Ziplocs?
- What?

302
00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.892
You carry all your crap in baggies?

303
00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:02.329
It keeps things from getting messy.

304
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:05.132
How's that working out for you?

305
00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:06.633
At least my phone is dry.

306
00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:14.641
We should've followed
the police boat back to shore.

307
00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.009
What, with a single paddle?

308
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:17.744
- Sure.
- I'm just saying.

309
00:16:17.744 --> 00:16:21.014
First of all, I figured we'd
be able to row back in later.

310
00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:22.949
Second,
lest we forget, prom queen,

311
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:24.984
you decided to take
a moonlight dip

312
00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.987
- in stormy waters.
- I fell off the boat.

313
00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.990
- And my name is Emma.
- Heh, heh.

314
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.692
Okay, Emma.

315
00:16:35.428 --> 00:16:36.663
Oh, my God.

316
00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:38.231
What?

317
00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:40.033
Island, there.

318
00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:41.401
Where?

319
00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:43.070
Right there. Okay.

320
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.471
Oh, that's way too far.

321
00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:46.939
We should sit here
until someone picks us up.

322
00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:49.142
Are you kidding?

323
00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:51.211
- Fine, I'll paddle.
- Okay, okay.

324
00:16:51.211 --> 00:16:55.082
- I'll paddle.
- Jeez.

325
00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:03.956
She never made it back to the hotel?

326
00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.693
- No. I thought maybe she was...
- Was she drinking?

327
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:09.028
What's that have to do with it?

328
00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.198
- Was she with Dean?
- What? No.

329
00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:12.965
He was on the boat?

330
00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.268
Yeah, but she didn't meet anyone.

331
00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:17.137
And she wasn't
hooking up with Dean.

332
00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:18.338
Ms. Collier, tell them...

333
00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:20.107
Can anything be done to find them?

334
00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:22.041
More than likely,
they'll find you.

335
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.377
This type of thing isn't uncommon.

336
00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.379
It's the youthful spirit of adventure.

337
00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.848
No, this is my best friend
we're talking about.

338
00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:30.183
I know her.

339
00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:32.585
She has no youthful spirit of adventure.

340
00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.242
Dean!

341
00:18:25.305 --> 00:18:27.174
You okay?

342
00:18:27.174 --> 00:18:29.542
Yeah.

343
00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:32.145
You?

344
00:18:32.145 --> 00:18:35.482
Yeah. Think so.

345
00:18:37.284 --> 00:18:40.620
No coverage.
We'll have to find a phone.

346
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.789
Great.

347
00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.362
Well, wait up.

348
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:01.174
Come on.

349
00:19:06.546 --> 00:19:09.549
Really?
Who's that for?

350
00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:13.320
I don't know.
Shoot the bad guys?

351
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:19.892
No, you finish it.
I could use a coffee.

352
00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:22.529
Like a mocha ice blended
with an extra shot.

353
00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:24.964
Oh, man.
How good would that be?

354
00:19:24.964 --> 00:19:26.999
Aah!

355
00:19:30.203 --> 00:19:32.905
- What was that?
- I hate bugs.

356
00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:35.975
Well, you've come
to the right place, then.

357
00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:37.910
Let's just find a hotel.

358
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.647
We're to finish working
on the school today.

359
00:19:40.647 --> 00:19:42.982
I'll bet everyone's
worried about us.

360
00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:47.420
You, maybe. I can promise you
nobody's worried about me.

361
00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:49.922
Yeah, this is Jack.

362
00:19:52.492 --> 00:19:54.261
I'm sorry, what?

363
00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.930
Excuse me.
Mrs. Robinson?

364
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.165
Barbara.

365
00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.768
Jack McMullen.
I'm Dean's father.

366
00:20:01.768 --> 00:20:03.202
Nice to meet you.

367
00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.374
What were they doing on the boat,

368
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.808
and who was watching them?

369
00:20:08.808 --> 00:20:10.743
- Now, Mrs. Rob...
- Don't condescend to me.

370
00:20:10.743 --> 00:20:12.645
Don't you dare condescend to me.

371
00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:15.348
I trusted you with our daughter.

372
00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:17.016
They can't find her.

373
00:20:17.016 --> 00:20:20.387
It's okay, we'll find her.
When is the next flight?

374
00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:21.921
There's a redeye tonight from Miami

375
00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:23.823
that makes connections in Trinidad.

376
00:20:23.823 --> 00:20:26.593
- There's not an earlier flight?
- No. That's the earliest.

377
00:20:26.593 --> 00:20:28.428
I can help you with arrangements...

378
00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:30.963
You've done enough.
Thank you. Let's go.

379
00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:34.166
My feet are killing me.

380
00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:36.636
I fricking hate hiking.

381
00:20:38.771 --> 00:20:43.343
- You wanna wear my Chucks?
- It's okay.

382
00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:45.011
Thanks, though.

383
00:20:48.014 --> 00:20:50.283
Hey, look.

384
00:20:50.283 --> 00:20:52.519
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop.

385
00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:54.086
What? They're berries.

386
00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:57.690
White and yellow, kill a fellow.
Purple and blue, good for you.

387
00:21:00.393 --> 00:21:03.496
You're a little bit weird.
You know that, right?

388
00:21:03.496 --> 00:21:05.898
Been called worse.

389
00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.896
Oh, my...

390
00:21:38.164 --> 00:21:39.932
Wow.

391
00:21:42.201 --> 00:21:44.036
It's beautiful.

392
00:21:46.873 --> 00:21:49.709
Come on.
We gotta keep going.

393
00:21:49.709 --> 00:21:52.712
- Let's just find a hotel.
- What?

394
00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:54.681
We may never
get back here again.

395
00:21:57.417 --> 00:21:59.051
Come on.
Take a picture.

396
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:02.254
We're in enough trouble.
You know, they grade this trip.

397
00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:04.924
I cannot mess with my GPA.

398
00:22:04.924 --> 00:22:09.596
Hello? Do you know
how unique this is?

399
00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:12.365
Okay. What's
your number-one school?

400
00:22:12.365 --> 00:22:14.867
Princeton. Why?

401
00:22:14.867 --> 00:22:19.171
You know how many people
applying have a 4.0?

402
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.640
A lot.

403
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.975
Know how many people
have been swimming in this?

404
00:22:22.975 --> 00:22:26.145
Think of the essay you could write.

405
00:22:26.145 --> 00:22:28.314
Come on.

406
00:22:28.314 --> 00:22:31.117
We gotta find a hotel.

407
00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:35.622
So lame. Fine.

408
00:22:35.622 --> 00:22:38.891
See, this is why
I don't hang out with people.

409
00:22:59.078 --> 00:23:01.781
I can't wait until we get
to a real bathroom.

410
00:23:01.781 --> 00:23:03.650
I can't wait for a coffee.

411
00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.909
Where are we?

412
00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:36.649
We've been walking for hours.

413
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:40.419
And we haven't seen
a single road, person.

414
00:23:41.588 --> 00:23:43.155
We better get back to the boat.

415
00:23:45.091 --> 00:23:48.094
Come on,
it's gonna be a long walk.

416
00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:05.612
What if we have to spend
the night on this island?

417
00:24:05.612 --> 00:24:07.346
I don't think we're gonna find

418
00:24:07.346 --> 00:24:09.248
a five-star hotel around here.

419
00:24:09.248 --> 00:24:11.117
Do you know how to make a fire?

420
00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:12.852
I do.

421
00:24:12.852 --> 00:24:14.721
Ta-da!

422
00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:20.026
- Perfect.
- What?

423
00:24:23.796 --> 00:24:25.164
A cave?

424
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.836
I am not sleeping in a cave.

425
00:24:29.836 --> 00:24:31.470
It's the safest place to be.

426
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.740
Dry if it rains,
only one way in.

427
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.275
Protection from the elements.

428
00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:37.977
Hey, can I use your phone?

429
00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:40.680
Sure.
There's no signal.

430
00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:45.317
I'm not a cave person.

431
00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:47.086
None of us are cave persons.

432
00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:50.422
We haven't been cave people
for a long...

433
00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:53.626
Go, go, go!

434
00:24:53.626 --> 00:24:56.696
Aah! Aah!

435
00:25:01.668 --> 00:25:06.539
So, that's a "no" on the cave.

436
00:25:13.479 --> 00:25:15.548
Where's the boat?

437
00:25:56.188 --> 00:25:58.658
I'm really tired.

438
00:25:58.658 --> 00:26:00.760
Can we take a break soon?

439
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.562
- Sure.
- Thanks.

440
00:26:17.543 --> 00:26:19.478
You see something?

441
00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:21.447
No.

442
00:26:21.447 --> 00:26:22.815
Use the flare gun.

443
00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:25.985
You need at least two flares.
I saw it in a book.

444
00:26:25.985 --> 00:26:27.920
I think it was the one with the girl

445
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.922
who sails around the world
with her cat.

446
00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:32.859
You fire two flares,
one to get their attention

447
00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:35.327
and the other
so they can locate you.

448
00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:36.663
Who's "they"?

449
00:26:36.663 --> 00:26:39.098
The people that are gonna
come get us, I guess.

450
00:26:39.098 --> 00:26:42.134
Our families and the police or whoever.

451
00:26:45.872 --> 00:26:47.606
Dean,
what are you doing?

452
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.621
What was that about?

453
00:27:04.156 --> 00:27:07.026
Hey, can I borrow
some of that bug stuff?

454
00:27:07.026 --> 00:27:08.227
Sure.

455
00:27:08.227 --> 00:27:09.528
Thanks.

456
00:27:09.528 --> 00:27:10.730
You want a pillow?

457
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.665
Heh. Thanks.

458
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:18.671
Wait a sec.

459
00:27:18.671 --> 00:27:20.172
What?

460
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.610
Aha.

461
00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.680
Damn, you should be
on that"Price Is Right"show.

462
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.981
I knew it was in here.

463
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:31.450
I put it in there
in case I got hungry

464
00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.252
when we were building yesterday.

465
00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:37.990
Thanks.

466
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.927
And I think you meant
"Let's Make a Deal."

467
00:27:40.927 --> 00:27:42.161
Hm?

468
00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:46.065
Oh. Right.

469
00:27:46.065 --> 00:27:47.900
- That show.
- Heh, heh, heh.

470
00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:55.007
- Here's some more.
- Thanks.

471
00:28:02.648 --> 00:28:05.952
<i>Flight 415 from Detroit to Miami,</i>

472
00:28:05.952 --> 00:28:07.887
<i>scheduled to depart at 11 p.m.,</i>

473
00:28:07.887 --> 00:28:13.459
<i>is now expected to depart
at 12:10 a.m. from Gate 211.</i>

474
00:28:13.459 --> 00:28:15.294
We're gonna get there.

475
00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:31.710
Why do you call me "prom queen"?

476
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.379
Aren't you?

477
00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:36.615
- No.
- You seem like you should be.

478
00:28:36.615 --> 00:28:39.218
Perfect girl, perfect world.

479
00:28:39.218 --> 00:28:41.487
I can't tell
if you're being mean or nice.

480
00:28:49.161 --> 00:28:53.599
What do you think's
out there? In the woods.

481
00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:55.301
We're gonna be fine.

482
00:28:55.301 --> 00:28:57.136
I know.

483
00:29:02.308 --> 00:29:04.944
- Still can't get a signal.
- Here.

484
00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:11.984
What are you doing?
You're gonna waste the battery.

485
00:29:11.984 --> 00:29:14.053
Just playing some music.

486
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:22.494
Here.

487
00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:23.729
Take my shirt.

488
00:29:23.729 --> 00:29:25.932
- Thank you.
- Sure.

489
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.275
- Night.
- Night.

490
00:29:38.845 --> 00:29:42.081
They'll come for us.
I know it.

491
00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:48.988
What was that?

492
00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:16.082
Ahh...

493
00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:43.575
Hey.

494
00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:47.079
You're a morning person, huh?

495
00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:49.081
What are you doing?

496
00:30:49.081 --> 00:30:51.217
I'm trying to save us.
What are you doing?

497
00:30:51.217 --> 00:30:54.553
I don't know.
Might go for a swim.

498
00:30:56.488 --> 00:30:57.789
Hey, where's your phone?

499
00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:59.358
Battery's dead.

500
00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:06.165
We need some more water.

501
00:31:08.434 --> 00:31:10.202
Yah!

502
00:31:42.935 --> 00:31:45.004
The police have a boat
searching the area

503
00:31:45.004 --> 00:31:46.472
where they picked up the kids.

504
00:31:46.472 --> 00:31:49.575
- As soon as they come back...
- When will they be back?

505
00:31:49.575 --> 00:31:51.377
Uh, I'm not sure.

506
00:31:51.377 --> 00:31:53.479
They said they'd let us know when...

507
00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:55.681
- Any word?
- I was just telling Barbara

508
00:31:55.681 --> 00:31:58.985
the police have a boat
searching the Caribbean.

509
00:31:58.985 --> 00:32:01.653
They did say a dinghy was missing.

510
00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:04.423
- How long they been looking?
- What about a helicopter?

511
00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:07.159
As soon as the winds die down,
they'll send someone.

512
00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:09.428
Have they been searching
land as well as water?

513
00:32:09.428 --> 00:32:12.231
You contacted the embassy?
Is there a team we can hire?

514
00:32:12.231 --> 00:32:14.133
- Money's not an issue.
- I understand.

515
00:32:14.133 --> 00:32:17.369
The police are doing
everything that they can.

516
00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:20.206
There is no private rescue team.

517
00:32:20.206 --> 00:32:22.541
But they did say
they were very confident

518
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:24.977
they're going to find
Dean and Emma.

519
00:32:24.977 --> 00:32:27.579
The first 48 hours
is the most important.

520
00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:29.881
But the chief said kids do this.

521
00:32:29.881 --> 00:32:31.550
If I hear one more time
what kids do...

522
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.986
- Are you kidding me?
- It's been two days.

523
00:32:33.986 --> 00:32:35.454
What are these people doing?

524
00:32:35.454 --> 00:32:39.358
Except offering anecdotal crap
about other teenagers.

525
00:32:39.358 --> 00:32:41.193
Huh?

526
00:32:41.193 --> 00:32:42.794
All right, look,
I'm sorry.

527
00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.630
Don't be sorry.

528
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.566
Help us find our children.

529
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:18.297
The hut's gonna be something
in case it rains.

530
00:33:18.297 --> 00:33:20.066
Rain?

531
00:33:20.066 --> 00:33:22.601
You never know.

532
00:33:28.907 --> 00:33:30.276
Ah! Ow!

533
00:33:30.276 --> 00:33:33.312
You okay?
Come here.

534
00:33:36.448 --> 00:33:40.018
This may sting a little.
Does that hurt?

535
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.256
Here, keep the pressure on it.

536
00:33:49.195 --> 00:33:52.431
So, why Princeton?

537
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:54.133
Hm?

538
00:33:54.133 --> 00:33:56.068
Why do you wanna go to Princeton?

539
00:33:56.068 --> 00:33:57.503
I don't know.

540
00:33:57.503 --> 00:34:00.639
- It's Ivy League.
- Yeah.

541
00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:04.610
It's just where we talked
about me going.

542
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:08.380
It's kind of weird, right?

543
00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:12.751
It's always been
where I wanted to go.

544
00:34:12.751 --> 00:34:15.421
Where I was supposed to go.

545
00:34:15.421 --> 00:34:19.125
I don't think
I ever even questioned it.

546
00:34:19.125 --> 00:34:21.627
Heh. Mm.

547
00:34:21.627 --> 00:34:24.130
Yeah.

548
00:34:26.432 --> 00:34:28.200
They're not gonna give up.

549
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.104
No, they'll come, for you.

550
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:41.113
Thanks, guys.

551
00:34:41.113 --> 00:34:43.315
Prepare to board in five minutes.

552
00:34:46.285 --> 00:34:48.220
I'm sorry.

553
00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:56.195
Did you find her?

554
00:34:56.195 --> 00:34:58.297
Not yet, but we will.

555
00:34:58.297 --> 00:35:02.234
Yeah, we're gonna
go back out tomorrow.

556
00:35:02.234 --> 00:35:04.136
Sweetie, your mom and I

557
00:35:04.136 --> 00:35:06.905
are gonna need to stay
a few more days. Is that okay?

558
00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:10.409
Sure.
Stay however long you need.

559
00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:14.373
There we go.
That should hold for a bit.

560
00:36:15.741 --> 00:36:17.609
Seriously?

561
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.226
Okay, now it's good.

562
00:36:36.328 --> 00:36:37.963
Celebration swim?

563
00:36:39.998 --> 00:36:41.967
Come on.

564
00:36:41.967 --> 00:36:44.936
Come on, it's like a million
degrees. We earned it.

565
00:37:11.597 --> 00:37:15.734
Argh! I cannot eat any more fruit!

566
00:38:07.052 --> 00:38:09.020
Hey, prom queen!

567
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.389
Don't look.

568
00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:12.991
I was gonna ask if you had
any more sunscreen left.

569
00:38:12.991 --> 00:38:16.328
I don't have any more anything left.
Look yourself.

570
00:38:16.328 --> 00:38:18.630
The bottles are
in the baggies in the hut.

571
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.566
I looked for them,
didn't see any.

572
00:38:20.566 --> 00:38:22.501
They're there,
but they're empty.

573
00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:24.603
I'm sure there's aloe somewhere.

574
00:38:24.603 --> 00:38:26.271
Now turn around and stop looking.

575
00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:29.140
You know that every time
you say that,

576
00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.010
it reminds me I should be looking?

577
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.612
I'm serious.

578
00:38:33.612 --> 00:38:36.682
You're the one
who asked me to stand guard.

579
00:38:36.682 --> 00:38:39.985
There's something out there.
I can hear it at night.

580
00:38:41.553 --> 00:38:43.889
This afternoon,

581
00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:46.224
the investigation
has been downgraded

582
00:38:46.224 --> 00:38:50.028
from a search-and-rescue
to a search-and-recovery effort

583
00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:52.698
as hope of finding
the pair alive has faded.

584
00:38:52.698 --> 00:38:54.466
I want you to call me every day.

585
00:38:54.466 --> 00:38:56.435
Sometimes twice a day if you can.

586
00:38:56.435 --> 00:38:57.969
I will, I promise.

587
00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:00.839
I just hate the idea
of leaving you alone down here.

588
00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:02.874
I'll be fine.
You've gotta go back.

589
00:39:02.874 --> 00:39:05.711
Stacey needs one of us there,
especially now.

590
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:07.979
No, I know.
You're right.

591
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.782
Well, it's official.

592
00:39:10.782 --> 00:39:14.019
They called off the rescue search.

593
00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:16.555
See what this is?
They don't have the resources.

594
00:39:16.555 --> 00:39:17.956
That's what it is.

595
00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:20.392
<i>...for the families
and the students back home</i>

596
00:39:20.392 --> 00:39:22.060
<i>who have kept constant...</i>

597
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.431
I'm not gonna stop, Phil.

598
00:39:25.431 --> 00:39:28.500
I promise,
I'll bring her back home.

599
00:39:29.935 --> 00:39:31.703
I know you will.

600
00:39:33.038 --> 00:39:34.640
I know you will.

601
00:39:40.712 --> 00:39:43.749
Jack, thank you for hiring this.

602
00:39:43.749 --> 00:39:46.685
We'll keep covering these waters.

603
00:39:46.685 --> 00:39:50.489
We still have two hours of flying time.

604
00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:05.771
I miss my mom and dad.

605
00:40:05.771 --> 00:40:08.807
I even miss my little sister.

606
00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:11.743
And my fish.

607
00:40:13.178 --> 00:40:14.546
The smell of my sheets

608
00:40:14.546 --> 00:40:16.715
when they first
get out of the dryer.

609
00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:23.121
I'll bet they're still looking for us.

610
00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:25.390
They'd have to be, right?

611
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.058
You think they quit?

612
00:40:27.058 --> 00:40:29.595
Would you?

613
00:40:29.595 --> 00:40:33.565
I mean, you keep looking
for something, at some point,

614
00:40:33.565 --> 00:40:35.901
you figure it's gone, right?

615
00:40:41.807 --> 00:40:45.677
Why do you do this?
Watch the sunset every day?

616
00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:48.113
Looking for something.

617
00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:50.448
What?

618
00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:54.953
Nothing.

619
00:40:54.953 --> 00:40:56.955
It's stupid.

620
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.292
Zippo's dead.

621
00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:04.696
We're gonna have to learn
to make our own fire now.

622
00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:10.569
- Oh!
- What is it?

623
00:41:18.343 --> 00:41:20.045
Oh, my God.

624
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.682
How long do you think
he was there?

625
00:41:23.682 --> 00:41:26.017
How long do you think
he pretended

626
00:41:26.017 --> 00:41:28.219
that he was gonna
make it home?

627
00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:34.159
This guy is not us, Em.

628
00:41:34.159 --> 00:41:37.929
He could've been some local
fisherman or drug smuggler or anyone.

629
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.499
You've got people out there
who love you.

630
00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:43.769
People looking for you.

631
00:41:45.604 --> 00:41:48.740
And you know what else?
We got each other.

632
00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.042
And that's something
right there, prom queen.

633
00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:54.512
We're gonna be okay.
You hear me?

634
00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:56.748
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you.

635
00:43:15.635 --> 00:43:18.472
Why are you crying?

636
00:43:18.472 --> 00:43:20.440
That was...

637
00:43:21.875 --> 00:43:24.511
That felt so good.

638
00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.582
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

639
00:43:30.584 --> 00:43:32.419
It's just...

640
00:43:32.419 --> 00:43:35.255
For a while,
I forgot where we were.

641
00:43:36.957 --> 00:43:39.994
I pictured us home,

642
00:43:39.994 --> 00:43:43.297
worrying about what
everybody was gonna say.

643
00:43:45.132 --> 00:43:48.335
I felt so normal. Heh.

644
00:44:14.828 --> 00:44:17.097
Hey, where's my latte?

645
00:44:19.666 --> 00:44:22.669
I'm going to the lagoon.

646
00:44:22.669 --> 00:44:25.672
Dean, did you take
the big water bottle?

647
00:44:27.007 --> 00:44:28.242
Dean?

648
00:44:30.777 --> 00:44:32.679
Dean?

649
00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:34.648
Dean?

650
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.352
Dean?

651
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:43.657
- Why would you do that?
- Do what?

652
00:44:43.657 --> 00:44:46.593
Leave me there without saying
where you were going...

653
00:44:46.593 --> 00:44:47.694
You were sleeping.

654
00:44:47.694 --> 00:44:50.197
And I woke up
and you were nowhere.

655
00:44:50.197 --> 00:44:51.631
What are you doing?

656
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:53.433
He deserves to be buried.

657
00:44:53.433 --> 00:44:55.535
Okay?
At least have a funeral.

658
00:44:58.505 --> 00:45:01.808
Dean, I don't understand.
What...?

659
00:45:01.808 --> 00:45:03.610
Talk to me.
I'm here and...

660
00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:04.711
You're here and what?

661
00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:07.281
We had sex once.
We're stuck on an island.

662
00:45:07.281 --> 00:45:09.283
We're not soulmates.

663
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.519
That's mean.

664
00:45:12.519 --> 00:45:15.755
Yeah, I'm not a nice guy, Emma.
And now you know.

665
00:45:18.158 --> 00:45:19.759
I don't believe that.

666
00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:23.730
Whatever it is, I'll listen.
Please, just give me...

667
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.465
Aah!

668
00:45:25.465 --> 00:45:28.302
Emma!

669
00:45:28.302 --> 00:45:30.470
I'm so sorry, Em.
I didn't mean to...

670
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.706
It was an accident.
I fell.

671
00:45:32.706 --> 00:45:36.076
I don't know what I'd do
if something happened to you.

672
00:45:39.713 --> 00:45:41.715
What are we doing?

673
00:45:41.715 --> 00:45:45.585
We're not some happy couple
on an island vacation.

674
00:45:45.585 --> 00:45:47.721
How are we gonna make it
day after day,

675
00:45:47.721 --> 00:45:50.524
just the two of us?
What if something goes wrong?

676
00:45:50.524 --> 00:45:52.759
I mean, what if I broke my leg,

677
00:45:52.759 --> 00:45:57.931
or one of us gets sick
or something like that?

678
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:59.999
Nobody knows what's out there, Em.

679
00:45:59.999 --> 00:46:03.403
There's stuff that
we don't know how to deal with

680
00:46:03.403 --> 00:46:05.839
and we just gotta figure it out.

681
00:46:16.316 --> 00:46:18.152
I didn't go to my mom's funeral.

682
00:46:18.152 --> 00:46:20.754
That's why
I wanted to bury that guy.

683
00:46:20.754 --> 00:46:23.123
Just flesh.

684
00:46:23.123 --> 00:46:25.725
Ashes to ashes.

685
00:46:25.725 --> 00:46:29.229
I thought maybe seeing him
dead in the ground and all that

686
00:46:29.229 --> 00:46:31.865
would make things make sense.

687
00:46:31.865 --> 00:46:33.200
Did it?

688
00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.635
Not really.

689
00:46:37.036 --> 00:46:39.306
I guess that's the point.

690
00:46:39.306 --> 00:46:41.541
It doesn't always make sense.

691
00:46:47.247 --> 00:46:49.883
We need hydrotherapy.

692
00:46:51.918 --> 00:46:54.521
And you kind of stink, so...

693
00:47:15.609 --> 00:47:17.211
Step into my office

694
00:47:17.211 --> 00:47:20.247
and tell me about
your problems, Mr. McMullen.

695
00:47:27.086 --> 00:47:29.389
I couldn't handle seeing...

696
00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:32.392
Seeing all of it.

697
00:47:34.761 --> 00:47:38.998
You know, the casket
and all the people pitying me.

698
00:47:38.998 --> 00:47:40.267
Blaming me or...

699
00:47:40.267 --> 00:47:42.569
Why would they blame you?

700
00:47:45.171 --> 00:47:46.573
Because I killed her.

701
00:47:53.947 --> 00:47:57.384
She was driving me home
from soccer practice.

702
00:47:57.384 --> 00:47:59.986
We were driving down this side road,

703
00:47:59.986 --> 00:48:02.689
and it was dark.

704
00:48:07.961 --> 00:48:10.497
We used to play this game
when it was snowing

705
00:48:10.497 --> 00:48:14.601
where she'd flick on
the high beams, on and off.

706
00:48:14.601 --> 00:48:16.970
It'd look like we were
going into hyperspace

707
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:20.073
from a"Star Wars" movie
or something like that.

708
00:48:20.073 --> 00:48:24.210
I reached over, trying to be funny,
trying to be like her.

709
00:48:25.912 --> 00:48:28.848
Lost control of the car.

710
00:48:28.848 --> 00:48:31.518
We were laughing,
and the next thing...

711
00:48:35.455 --> 00:48:39.125
I was in the hospital for three days.

712
00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:41.528
When I got out,
she was gone.

713
00:48:41.528 --> 00:48:44.664
You didn't kill her.

714
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.339
No.

715
00:48:54.474 --> 00:48:57.043
We should maybe think
about moving here.

716
00:48:57.043 --> 00:48:58.378
Nice neighborhood,

717
00:48:58.378 --> 00:49:01.548
and I hear the public schools
are great.

718
00:49:11.725 --> 00:49:14.661
♪ Throw away the paper

719
00:49:17.397 --> 00:49:19.799
♪ Throw away the mail

720
00:49:22.369 --> 00:49:26.005
♪ Be bad if you wanna

721
00:49:28.775 --> 00:49:31.511
♪ Be prepared to fail

722
00:49:34.247 --> 00:49:37.584
♪ And all the expectations

723
00:49:39.753 --> 00:49:43.156
♪ Take you to the point

724
00:49:43.156 --> 00:49:46.626
♪ Of never believing

725
00:49:46.626 --> 00:49:50.864
♪ And you're tired of me

726
00:49:50.864 --> 00:49:54.334
♪ Still nobody knows it

727
00:49:56.403 --> 00:49:59.506
♪ Something I can't be

728
00:50:02.308 --> 00:50:05.579
♪ My love

729
00:50:11.217 --> 00:50:14.721
♪ And there's no one here

730
00:50:14.721 --> 00:50:18.358
♪ Who loves you like I do

731
00:50:19.659 --> 00:50:25.465
♪ Thank God
♪ This much is real

732
00:50:25.465 --> 00:50:30.437
♪ Thank God
♪ This much is real

733
00:50:30.437 --> 00:50:36.810
♪ And broken down

734
00:50:45.184 --> 00:50:49.055
Nearly a month after
two students went missing

735
00:50:49.055 --> 00:50:50.524
off the coast of Trinidad,

736
00:50:50.524 --> 00:50:52.892
the search for Emmaline Robinson
and Dean McMullen

737
00:50:52.892 --> 00:50:54.561
now has officially been called off.

738
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:57.997
It's believed the students
have been lost at sea.

739
00:50:57.997 --> 00:51:00.667
I can't believe they're gonna
stop looking for her.

740
00:51:00.667 --> 00:51:03.202
Even if it's just for
her body or something.

741
00:51:03.202 --> 00:51:06.039
Wow, Helen,
that's kind of morbid.

742
00:51:06.039 --> 00:51:09.008
Her mom's still there.
Maybe she'll find her.

743
00:51:10.243 --> 00:51:11.611
I know we've been over this,

744
00:51:11.611 --> 00:51:13.713
but if you'd look
at the new information

745
00:51:13.713 --> 00:51:16.716
regarding the weather patterns
the night of the party,

746
00:51:16.716 --> 00:51:19.052
you'd see we've been
looking in the wrong place.

747
00:51:19.052 --> 00:51:22.155
Mrs. Robinson,
I've seen this information.

748
00:51:22.155 --> 00:51:26.159
- Perhaps your embassy can...
- I've been to the embassy twice.

749
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.082
Excuse me,
have you seen these two?

750
00:52:02.228 --> 00:52:05.865
Sorry, folks,
no planes taking off today.

751
00:52:12.305 --> 00:52:15.509
They say the storm could last for days.

752
00:52:15.509 --> 00:52:17.511
Yep.

753
00:52:23.817 --> 00:52:27.086
When my wife died, I...

754
00:52:27.086 --> 00:52:30.289
I tried so hard
to keep her here, you know.

755
00:52:30.289 --> 00:52:32.125
Keep her alive.

756
00:52:33.627 --> 00:52:36.730
I almost lost everything I had.

757
00:52:38.732 --> 00:52:40.600
Dean and I barely spoke.

758
00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.970
I almost lost my partnership
at the firm.

759
00:52:47.974 --> 00:52:50.176
I was so focused
on what I'd lost,

760
00:52:50.176 --> 00:52:51.978
I forgot what I had.

761
00:52:56.349 --> 00:52:58.818
Maybe it's time to go home, Barbara.

762
00:53:01.054 --> 00:53:03.557
It's not like we haven't tried.

763
00:53:03.557 --> 00:53:05.792
It's a tough call.

764
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.102
Whenever we were at the beach,

765
00:53:49.102 --> 00:53:51.671
my mom used to talk
about the green flash.

766
00:53:51.671 --> 00:53:55.408
My dad and I
would watch and watch.

767
00:53:55.408 --> 00:53:58.211
I've never seen it.

768
00:53:58.211 --> 00:54:01.414
It's supposed to be
right on the horizon line,

769
00:54:01.414 --> 00:54:05.284
just as the sun comes down.

770
00:54:05.284 --> 00:54:07.687
I'm thinking maybe
it's just a thing...

771
00:54:07.687 --> 00:54:11.190
...people believe in to make them feel

772
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:16.062
like there's something out there,
beauty or whatever.

773
00:54:18.832 --> 00:54:22.802
How long do you really think
we can survive here?

774
00:54:29.709 --> 00:54:32.946
We're gonna be fine, okay?

775
00:54:37.083 --> 00:54:40.954
♪ I've been sinking
♪ Through the drain of love

776
00:54:40.954 --> 00:54:44.958

794
00:56:16.483 --> 00:56:17.578
Should we feel guilty?

795
00:56:19.318 --> 00:56:21.053
For what?

796
00:56:22.722 --> 00:56:25.858
Not being sad all the time.

797
00:56:25.858 --> 00:56:28.761
They probably think we're dead.

798
00:56:28.761 --> 00:56:31.063
But we're not dead.

799
00:56:31.063 --> 00:56:34.066
So we gotta live
a little, right?

800
00:56:34.066 --> 00:56:37.102
I just feel like
we should be doing something,

801
00:56:37.102 --> 00:56:40.139
like trying to find a way off or...

802
00:56:40.139 --> 00:56:42.341
We tried.

803
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:44.309
We'll keep trying.

804
00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:50.582
Have you been shaving?

805
00:56:50.582 --> 00:56:51.884
What?

806
00:56:51.884 --> 00:56:54.386
You have, like,
almost no beard.

807
00:56:56.822 --> 00:57:00.525
Okay, first of all, bite me.

808
00:57:02.694 --> 00:57:06.031
And second of all,
it'll get heavier,

809
00:57:06.031 --> 00:57:07.767
I hope.

810
00:57:14.406 --> 00:57:15.941
Was that okay?

811
00:57:17.176 --> 00:57:18.377
I mean...

812
00:57:18.377 --> 00:57:21.213
was I okay?

813
00:57:22.281 --> 00:57:25.751
Emma, you are
so much better than okay.

814
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:28.253
Okay?

815
00:57:28.253 --> 00:57:30.823
If okay is around here somewhere,

816
00:57:30.823 --> 00:57:33.125
you are way over
the damn palm trees.

817
00:57:33.125 --> 00:57:35.828
If okay is like
a little tiny grain of sand,

818
00:57:35.828 --> 00:57:37.229
you're the whole beach.

819
00:57:37.229 --> 00:57:40.265
If okay is like
a little drop of water,

820
00:57:40.265 --> 00:57:42.634
you're like
the whole freaking Caribbean.

821
00:57:42.634 --> 00:57:45.771
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Need me to go on?

822
00:57:45.771 --> 00:57:47.639
Okay.

823
00:57:50.475 --> 00:57:53.212
You were never
like this at school.

824
00:57:53.212 --> 00:57:55.347
Like what?

825
00:57:55.347 --> 00:57:58.317
I don't know, fun.

826
00:58:00.085 --> 00:58:01.921
You're different too.

827
00:58:01.921 --> 00:58:03.688
No, I'm not.

828
00:58:03.688 --> 00:58:07.326
Yeah, you kind of are.

829
00:58:07.326 --> 00:58:10.329
How so?

830
00:58:10.329 --> 00:58:13.632
No posse, no books.

831
00:58:13.632 --> 00:58:16.501
I used to watch you sometimes.

832
00:58:16.501 --> 00:58:19.805
That's not creepy.

833
00:58:19.805 --> 00:58:22.607
You always seemed like
you had a plan.

834
00:58:22.607 --> 00:58:26.912
Like you had something to do
or somewhere to go.

835
00:58:28.914 --> 00:58:31.783
I guess now
you got nowhere to go, huh?

836
00:58:34.486 --> 00:58:38.623
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

837
00:58:38.623 --> 00:58:41.260
I kind of like where I am.

838
00:58:42.694 --> 00:58:46.866
And for the record,
I watched you sometimes too.

839
00:58:52.104 --> 00:58:54.506
Who was your first time?

840
00:58:55.607 --> 00:58:56.942
Oh, we're playing that game?

841
00:58:56.942 --> 00:58:59.845
Yeah, we are. Who?

842
00:58:59.845 --> 00:59:03.949
I was a sophomore
and she was a junior.

843
00:59:03.949 --> 00:59:05.717
Do I know her?

844
00:59:05.717 --> 00:59:07.686
No, she was in college.

845
00:59:07.686 --> 00:59:09.889
I don't know.

846
00:59:09.889 --> 00:59:12.357
I thought she could
teach me some stuff.

847
00:59:12.357 --> 00:59:15.160
Was it fun?

848
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.762
All five minutes were a blast.

849
00:59:24.603 --> 00:59:27.206
Okay, who was your first?

850
00:59:27.206 --> 00:59:30.475
Mm... Heh.

851
00:59:33.345 --> 00:59:36.381
No, no, no.

852
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:37.482
No.

853
00:59:37.482 --> 00:59:41.220
I told you mine,
now you have to tell me yours.

854
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:45.757
Football player?
Band geek?

855
00:59:45.757 --> 00:59:47.392
- Teacher?
- You.

856
00:59:47.392 --> 00:59:49.294
What?

857
00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:50.795
You.

858
00:59:50.795 --> 00:59:53.465
Me?

859
00:59:53.465 --> 00:59:55.434
I was your...?

860
00:59:55.434 --> 00:59:57.569
Wow. Wow.

861
00:59:57.569 --> 00:59:59.271
Is that a bad "wow"?

862
00:59:59.271 --> 01:00:00.605
No.

863
01:00:00.605 --> 01:00:02.774
Just a "wow."

864
01:00:02.774 --> 01:00:05.010
Wow.

865
01:00:09.915 --> 01:00:12.484
Was it okay?

866
01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:16.288
I got sand in some weird places.

867
01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:24.463
I'm glad it was me.

868
01:00:24.463 --> 01:00:26.999
Me too.

869
01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:31.236
So since this is all
pretty new to me,

870
01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:33.672
maybe we should practice more.

871
01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:35.941
Yeah.

872
01:01:21.186 --> 01:01:24.523
Emma, did you hear that?

873
01:01:24.523 --> 01:01:28.460
Plane! Get the flare gun.
I'll catch up with you.

874
01:01:44.643 --> 01:01:45.844
No, no, no.

875
01:01:45.844 --> 01:01:50.849
Hey! Hey! Hey!

876
01:01:50.849 --> 01:01:52.451
Hey!

877
01:01:56.288 --> 01:01:58.623
They were too high.

878
01:01:58.623 --> 01:02:00.992
Did you fire both flares?
I didn't see.

879
01:02:00.992 --> 01:02:02.927
No, I couldn't find the gun.

880
01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:04.363
What do you mean?

881
01:02:04.363 --> 01:02:06.365
It's in the same place
it's always been.

882
01:02:06.365 --> 01:02:09.000
This is our chance, Dean.

883
01:02:10.135 --> 01:02:12.471
I don't understand.
Where could it be?

884
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:14.439
- Did you move it?
- No.

885
01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:16.775
You're the only one
who's ever picked it up.

886
01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:18.477
So you're saying I lost it?

887
01:02:18.477 --> 01:02:22.047
I'm not saying anybody lost it,
I'm saying it's not there.

888
01:02:22.047 --> 01:02:25.016
Someone's been taking our stuff.

889
01:02:25.016 --> 01:02:27.219
The baggies and my lotions

890
01:02:27.219 --> 01:02:29.020
and my sunscreen and toothpaste.

891
01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.622
That stuff ran out
a long time ago.

892
01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:32.591
Yeah, but I kept the bottles.

893
01:02:32.591 --> 01:02:34.993
I use them for aloe
and for water and...

894
01:02:34.993 --> 01:02:36.228
Where's the water bottle?

895
01:02:36.228 --> 01:02:38.397
It's probably there somewhere.

896
01:02:38.397 --> 01:02:40.732
I bet you were
organizing things one day...

897
01:02:40.732 --> 01:02:42.701
Oh, really, organizing?

898
01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:45.804
That's what happened,
I organized too much.

899
01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:52.377
Hang on.

900
01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:55.847
Emma. Emma.

901
01:02:55.847 --> 01:02:57.416
Get off me.

902
01:03:02.187 --> 01:03:04.856
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

903
01:03:04.856 --> 01:03:06.491
I can't.
I can't do this.

904
01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:10.229
I cannot stay
on this island anymore!

905
01:03:10.229 --> 01:03:13.432
What are you gonna do,
swim back?

906
01:03:16.568 --> 01:03:18.036
Emma.

907
01:03:35.454 --> 01:03:38.357
Hello!

908
01:03:40.159 --> 01:03:42.627
There's no one out there,
is there?

909
01:03:44.429 --> 01:03:47.166
Hello!

910
01:04:24.969 --> 01:04:27.606
We've seen one plane
since we've been here.

911
01:04:27.606 --> 01:04:30.342
I'm never gonna see my family again.

912
01:04:37.682 --> 01:04:41.420
We'll be better off in there, long-term.

913
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.889
What's long-term, Dean?

914
01:04:44.889 --> 01:04:46.491
Look, Em, at some point,

915
01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:48.360
we're gonna have to say
this is it.

916
01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.696
This is our life, you know?
It's you and me.

917
01:04:56.818 --> 01:04:58.954
You hear that?

918
01:04:58.954 --> 01:05:00.622
It's nothing.
It's just the wind.

919
01:05:00.622 --> 01:05:03.525
I'm gonna find whatever it is
and make it stop.

920
01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:06.862
Dean, no.

921
01:05:33.522 --> 01:05:34.990
Dean?

922
01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.582
Dean!

923
01:06:11.611 --> 01:06:12.978
Dean!

924
01:06:29.161 --> 01:06:30.630

It smelled a little weird.

982
01:11:44.912 --> 01:11:46.848
- What was that?
- What the...?

983
01:11:56.057 --> 01:11:58.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, buddy.

984
01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.827
Stop, stop.
Okay, put it down.

985
01:11:59.827 --> 01:12:02.297
Put the gun down
and step away from the vehicle.

986
01:12:02.297 --> 01:12:04.832
Come on, monkey,
drop the gun.

987
01:12:06.201 --> 01:12:09.237
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
Put it down!

988
01:12:09.237 --> 01:12:10.572
Come on, little guy.

989
01:12:10.572 --> 01:12:13.575
I'll trade you,
banana for the gun.

990
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:18.213
He didn't even take his banana.

992
01:12:24.519 --> 01:12:26.421

What'd you do that for?

993
01:12:26.421 --> 01:12:27.822
I don't wanna hope anymore.

994
01:12:27.822 --> 01:12:30.091
You're acting crazy.
Why did you fire...?

995
01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:31.493
Oh, I'm crazy?

996
01:12:31.493 --> 01:12:33.828
No, see, crazy is thinking
we can survive

997
01:12:33.828 --> 01:12:36.130
for more than a year
on this stupid island.

998
01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:37.332
That's crazy.

999
01:12:37.332 --> 01:12:39.066
We're gonna make
a life here, Em.

1000
01:12:39.066 --> 01:12:40.668
It's gonna be better,
I promise.

1001
01:12:40.668 --> 01:12:43.738
No noise. I mean,
what's so good out there anyway?

1002
01:12:43.738 --> 01:12:47.242
Life, Dean. Life is
what's so good out there.

Everything.

1004
01:12:53.448 --> 01:12:55.617
You're crazy if you think
for one second

1005
01:12:55.617 --> 01:12:58.052
I would actually choose
to live like this.

1006
01:12:58.052 --> 01:13:00.355
This is not living,
this is surviving.

1007
01:13:20.275 --> 01:13:22.777
Any luck?

1008
01:13:22.777 --> 01:13:24.779
No.

1010
01:13:29.751 --> 01:13:31.819

01:17:07.401 --> 01:17:09.904
My dad told me about your party.

1062
01:17:09.904 --> 01:17:14.008
Mom's throwing it,
a homecoming thing.

1063
01:17:14.008 --> 01:17:15.443
Are you gonna come?

1064
01:17:15.443 --> 01:17:17.411
Lots of kids from school
will be there. It'll be fun.

1065
01:17:17.411 --> 01:17:20.482
Yeah, fun.

1066
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:25.787
You should probably go.

1067
01:17:25.787 --> 01:17:27.722
My mom and dad
have been checking on me

1068
01:17:27.722 --> 01:17:29.991
like every 10 minutes.

1069
01:17:29.991 --> 01:17:31.759
Sure.

1070
01:17:31.759 --> 01:17:34.161
Come to the party, okay?

1071
01:17:48.142 --> 01:17:51.378
First of all, thank you
guys so much for coming.

1072
01:17:51.378 --> 01:17:53.715
It's a special day for us.

1073
01:17:53.715 --> 01:17:56.684
I can't imagine the courage it took

1074
01:17:56.684 --> 01:17:58.119
to survive those days.

1075
01:17:58.119 --> 01:18:00.087
I really can't.

1076
01:18:00.087 --> 01:18:02.156
But I'm so grateful that you did.

1077
01:18:02.156 --> 01:18:03.858
To my girl...

1078
01:18:03.858 --> 01:18:05.760

Where is Dean?

1079
01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.962
Behind you.

1080
01:18:07.962 --> 01:18:10.297
I cannot thank you enough.

1081
01:18:10.297 --> 01:18:13.000
You kids really are
an inspiration to us all.

1082
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.670
I mean that.
To Emma and to Dean.

1083

1084
01:18:17.539 --> 01:18:19.507

1086
01:18:24.946 --> 01:18:28.215
- Thank you for coming.
- Thanks for having us.

1087
01:18:28.215 --> 01:18:31.185
How come you're not over there
with everybody else?

1088
01:18:31.185 --> 01:18:34.689
I'm not really
an everybody-else kind of guy.

1089
01:18:34.689 --> 01:18:38.292
Emma is. Always has been.

1090
01:18:38.292 --> 01:18:41.629
She's really good at that.
People really like her.

1091
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:45.199
Yeah, I can see that.
Did you see any sharks?

1092
01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:48.803
It took her like two seconds
to become even more popular

1093
01:18:48.803 --> 01:18:50.471
than before you guys went away.

1094
01:18:50.471 --> 01:18:52.774
Yeah, I can see that too.

1095
01:19:00.347 --> 01:19:01.749

1097
01:19:02.984 --> 01:19:07.021
I can't come. Sorry.
