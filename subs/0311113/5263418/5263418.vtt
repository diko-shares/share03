1
00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:19.883
Come on. It's all right.

2
00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.188
Yes, it's all right.

3
00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:32.232
Wake up, Will.

4
00:04:38.712 --> 00:04:41.306
Starboard bow ahoy.

5
00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:52.181
- What is it, Slade?
- Thought I heard somethin'.

6
00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.352
Sounded like a bell.

7
00:04:55.929 --> 00:05:00.161
- Native fishermen, perhaps.
- Or a reef marker, sir.

8
00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:03.203
Mr Calamy, the lead, if you please.

9
00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:22.282
- By the mark, five fathom.
- Five fathom.

10
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.769
Sand and broken shell.

11
00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:48.911
What is it?

12
00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:53.612
Two points off the starboard bow,
in the fog bank.

13
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.745
What was it? A sail?

14
00:05:55.822 --> 00:06:00.316
- I don't know what it was.
- Should we beat to quarters?

15
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:11.970
- I can't be certain.
- You're officer of the watch.

16
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:15.064
Hollom, you must make a decision.

17
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.908
We shall beat to quarters.

18
00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:24.277
Rouse up. Sleepers awake.

19
00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.615
Move. Move along.

20
00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:33.819
Jump to it, boys. Jump to it.

21
00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:37.195
Light along there.

22
00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:00.613
Sighting in heavy fog.

23
00:07:00.687 --> 00:07:04.214
- Handsomely on the yards tackle.
- Topmen aloft.

24
00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:15.297
Where away?

25
00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:20.136
Two points off the starboard bow, sir.
Not a mile distant.

26
00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:26.012
- You sure, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:29.474
Man-of-war?

28
00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:33.350
I don't know, sir.

29
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.254
It was only for a moment.
I thought I saw a shape.

30
00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:43.492
- Did you see it, Mr Calamy?
- No, sir.

31
00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:50.229
You did the right thing, Mr Hollom.
Go to your stations.

32
00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:54.071
The deck's yours, Tom.

33
00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:55.607
Sir.

34
00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:01.911
Clear away. And launch boats.

35
00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:12.720
- Quit your dawdling.
- You heard the man.

36
00:08:12.793 --> 00:08:15.261
Lower away.

37
00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.224
Haul both your yard tackles.

38
00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:26.301
Strike the bell.

39
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.900
Down. All hands down.

40
00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:14.413
Hands to your stations.
Mr Hollar, damage report, if you please.

41
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.364
18-pounders. We'll have to get closer.
Run out the starboard battery.

42
00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:31.267
Mr Allen, come up on the wind.
Lay me alongside at pistol-shot.

43
00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:39.674
Sharpshooters to the tops, Mr Howard.

44
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.340
Sergeant. Take your section
into the main top.

45
00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:45.384
We stand tall on the quarterdeck.
All of us.

46
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.489
- Mr Boyle, run up the colors.
- Aye, sir.

47
00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:58.453
Note for the log, Mr Watt.
"Engaged enemy frigate at six bells."

48
00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:05.563
- Straight at 'em, Mr Mowett.
- Straight at 'em, sir.

49
00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:08.072
Bill.

50
00:10:08.175 --> 00:10:11.042
Leave the swords.
Get the captain's silver below.

51
00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:15.171
She's not in range yet.
Stand fast till she's close enough.

52
00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:19.082
- Close with him amidships.
- Midships it is, sir.

53
00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:22.085
For God's sake, don't drop anything.

54
00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:28.588
Steady.

55
00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:32.222
- Hold your positions.
- Hold your position. Courage, now.

56
00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:37.700
- Hold steady, boys.
- Don't worry, lads, we'll serve 'em out yet.

57
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:42.172
Mr Pullings, sir.
Davies, Jemmy, get Mr Pullings below.

58
00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:43.903
Aye, sir.

59
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.535
Mr Blakeney, pass the word for the captain.

60
00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:49.377
Clear the forward pin rails.

61
00:10:55.789 --> 00:10:57.416
More sand on the floor.

62
00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:01.084
On the up-roll, fire!

63
00:11:14.107 --> 00:11:15.768
Down!

64
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:29.279
Relieving-tackles on the tiller.
You men, collect these wounded.

65
00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:36.486
- Keep 'em spitting, Mr Calamy.
- Aye, sir. Reload and give 'em hell.

66
00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:04.954
Sir. To the taffrail.

67
00:12:11.498 --> 00:12:14.592
The rudder's shot away.
The steering don't answer.

68
00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:16.966
We're fish in a barrel.

69
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.542
Why are we not firing?

70
00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:32.507
Let me through.

71
00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:35.110
Here, Joe.

72
00:12:35.188 --> 00:12:37.281
Hold it in there.

73
00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:46.722
- He's on the larboard bow, sir.
- Bring up your small arms.

74
00:12:49.836 --> 00:12:52.327
Prepare to repel boarders.

75
00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:55.568
Seize your weapons
and wait for the word.

76
00:12:57.677 --> 00:13:00.009
Your orders, sir?

77
00:13:00.981 --> 00:13:05.348
Call the gun crews to deck. Rig man-ropes
over the stern and pull the boats in.

78
00:13:05.418 --> 00:13:08.012
Put us in that fog, Tom.

79
00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.524
Pull together, men.

80
00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:23.728
Pull for the fog bank.

81
00:13:25.105 --> 00:13:27.665
Run 'em out.

82
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:33.706
Fire!

83
00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:39.042
She's opened up a seam.
We need to get some oakum and pound it in.

84
00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:41.883
Joe, a mallet and some irons.

85
00:13:47.794 --> 00:13:50.024
She's gaining on us.

86
00:13:57.137 --> 00:14:01.071
- We're nearly there, boys.
- Pull.

87
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:04.372
- Reach for it, men.
- We're home inside that fog.

88
00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:10.446
Fire!

89
00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:14.953
Pull for Lucky Jack.

90
00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:17.216
We've done it.

91
00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:22.392
Pipe down. Silence on deck.

92
00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:35.433
They'll not find us in here.

93
00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:39.137
Quiet, lads. No shouts, no calls.

94
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.335
Avast rowing.

95
00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:14.678
Well done, lads.

96
00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:42.038
Two feet six inches, sir, and holding.

97
00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:48.408
- Good work, Mr Lamb.
- Thank you, sir.

98
00:15:58.992 --> 00:16:01.153
So, what's the butcher's bill?

99
00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:03.821
Nine dead, 27 wounded.

100
00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:14.537
Joe Plaice.

101
00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:17.631
He has a severely
depressed fracture of the skull.

102
00:16:17.702 --> 00:16:19.943
I don't think he'll
see out the night.

103
00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:22.444
Lord Blakeney.

104
00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:27.516
Just a broken arm, sir.

105
00:16:28.788 --> 00:16:31.757
You're in very good hands.

106
00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:40.057
I'm doing everything I can.
I know you were close to his father.

107
00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:44.534
His father would've understood.
He knew the life. His mother, however…

108
00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:48.096
Let me take a look at that brow of yours.

109
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.073
What?

110
00:16:54.814 --> 00:16:57.908
Damn, he was good.
Just came out of nowhere.

111
00:16:57.984 --> 00:17:03.115
Hit us with a full broadside,
cut across our tail and took out our rudder.

112
00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:05.453
Damn fine gunnery.

113
00:17:06.426 --> 00:17:11.090
We only slipped away because of the fog.
Quite fortunate, really.

114
00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:15.931
He may have had the weather gauge,
but we had the weather gods.

115
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.118
I have no idea
what it is you're talking about,

116
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:22.876
but he did seem
to come off rather well.

117
00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:29.079
Seven weeks sailing, and he happens
in darkness on our exact position.

118
00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:35.581
The French have their spies
in England and elsewhere. As do we.

119
00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:37.989
Indeed.

120
00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:41.860
If he knew we were
looking for him,

121
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:45.356
he could have stood to sea
and passed well clear.

122
00:17:45.465 --> 00:17:48.628
Well then, perhaps he was looking for us.

123
00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:17.352
If she was a frigate,
then I am a Dutchman.

124
00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:20.398
It was an unfair match.
There was no dishonor in it.

125
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.730
She was more like a ship of the line.

126
00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:26.168
You have to wonder about her hull.
Our shots wouldn't penetrate.

127
00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:28.867
Triple-shotted at 200 yards - no effect.

128
00:18:28.975 --> 00:18:32.706
She had the weather gauge
and a clear advantage in firepower.

129
00:18:32.812 --> 00:18:35.372
What is the weather gauge?

130
00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:39.008
- Shall I show you again, Stephen?
- Not on the cloth.

131
00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:45.217
It means she had the wind in her favor,
therefore control of the engagement.

132
00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:48.658
And she had longer guns,
so she could hit us beyond our range.

133
00:18:48.728 --> 00:18:52.391
The simple fact is
we were soundly beaten.

134
00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:59.931
- Heavy frigate like that in the Pacific…
- Could tip the war in Napoleon's favor.

135
00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:05.569
By comparison, the Surprise
is a somewhat aged man-of-war.

136
00:19:09.282 --> 00:19:14.083
- Am I not correct?
- Would you call me an aged man of war?

137
00:19:14.187 --> 00:19:17.520
The Surprise is not old.
No one would call her old.

138
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.129
She has a bluff bow, lovely lines.

139
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.756
She's a fine sea boat,
weatherly, stiff and fast.

140
00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:27.230
Very fast, if she's well-handled.

141
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.427
No, she's not old.

142
00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:32.762
She's in her prime.

143
00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:37.434
We can patch up the main and mizzen.
Foresail's gone, so we'll bend our spare.

144
00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:41.604
Mr Lamb is confident with basic repairs.
We can get home as we are.

145
00:19:41.714 --> 00:19:44.547
We're not going home.

146
00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:57.623
But to refit we need a port, and the Acheron
may be still looking for us.

147
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:02.064
We can refit at sea.
Here, where it shoals.

148
00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:06.348
As you said, she is taking
the war to the South Seas.

149
00:20:06.419 --> 00:20:08.002
We are supposed to stop her.

150
00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:15.343
But, sir - with respect - she's a vastly
heavier ship. She's out of our class.

151
00:20:16.282 --> 00:20:19.979
She could be halfway to Cape Horn
by the time we're repaired.

152
00:20:20.086 --> 00:20:23.783
Well then, there's not a moment to lose.

153
00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:45.338
Is it true they put the last stitch
through your nose?

154
00:20:45.445 --> 00:20:47.504
What do you mean?

155
00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:49.882
Joe said when you die,

156
00:20:49.953 --> 00:20:53.884
they stitch you in your hammock
with the last stitch in your nose,

157
00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:57.183
just to make sure you're not asleep.

158
00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:04.285
Not through the nose. You'll tell them?

159
00:22:00.953 --> 00:22:05.447
It's all right.
It's just the laudanum speaking.

160
00:22:39.058 --> 00:22:41.822
I've never seen a braver patient.

161
00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:50.727
Poor darling.
Never mind, soon have you fixed up.

162
00:22:50.803 --> 00:22:52.768
I want good work now.

163
00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:57.332
I'll need two men into the starboard
forechannels. Roberts, Chadwick.

164
00:22:57.443 --> 00:22:59.502
That's nice work there.

165
00:22:59.612 --> 00:23:02.911
Repair won't do here.
I need these replaced.

166
00:23:09.622 --> 00:23:12.955
Mr Calamy. There's something
might interest you here.

167
00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:17.621
Look. The captain carved that.
When he was a mid, no more than your age.

168
00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:19.595
He's known this ship man and boy.

169
00:23:19.665 --> 00:23:24.864
He says there's enough of his blood in the
woodwork for the ship to almost be a relation.

170
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:29.203
I do understand your point.
Your knowledge is beyond question.

171
00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:34.712
However, a week in the Brazilian rain forest
looking for a new mast simply will not do.

172
00:23:34.814 --> 00:23:37.044
The Acheron will be halfway to China.

173
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:39.683
Mr Lamb, as always, will do his best.

174
00:23:39.754 --> 00:23:42.953
Which is all I can hope
to expect from any man.

175
00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:18.719
Is them his brains?

176
00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:22.692
No, that's just dried blood.
Those are his brains.

177
00:24:28.034 --> 00:24:31.367
Physician, he is.
Ain't one of your common surgeons.

178
00:24:31.437 --> 00:24:34.600
- Can I have the coin, please?
- Sir.

179
00:24:39.345 --> 00:24:42.075
He wouldn't look at you
for under ten guineas on land.

180
00:24:42.181 --> 00:24:44.342
And he knows his birds and beasts.

181
00:24:44.417 --> 00:24:47.784
You show him a beetle
and he'll tell you what it's thinking.

182
00:24:47.887 --> 00:24:51.414
Back to work, you loafers.
Eckhart, use your pipe.

183
00:24:51.524 --> 00:24:53.924
Let's get on with it, gentlemen.

184
00:24:54.026 --> 00:24:57.792
You're not a pennyweight of use
gawpin' here.

185
00:25:04.403 --> 00:25:06.963
Still hasn't said a word, sir.

186
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:15.403
Lord Blakeney. Feeling better?

187
00:25:15.481 --> 00:25:17.574
Much better, thank you, sir.

188
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.743
Well, good. Good.

189
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.750
The doctor told me
you were fond of reading, so I…

190
00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:35.489
It has all of his major battles
and some fine illustrations.

191
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:37.501
Thank you, sir.

192
00:25:38.738 --> 00:25:41.298
Did you ever meet Lord Nelson, sir?

193
00:25:41.407 --> 00:25:45.104
I had the honor of serving with him.
At the Nile. A great victory.

194
00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:51.275
You can find it in here, actually.
Page 135, if I'm not mistaken.

195
00:25:52.685 --> 00:25:54.585
Yes.

196
00:26:00.493 --> 00:26:04.361
May I beg you to tell me
what kind of man he is?

197
00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:08.590
You should read the book.

198
00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:11.261
I will, sir. Thank you.

199
00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:37.054
Here we go again.
Scrape-scrape, screech-screech.

200
00:26:37.163 --> 00:26:41.065
Never a tune you could dance to,
not if you were drunk as Davy's sow.

201
00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:52.807
How about this?

202
00:26:52.878 --> 00:26:57.338
Or are you in the mood
for something more aggressive?

203
00:28:10.723 --> 00:28:12.884
Salute.

204
00:28:12.958 --> 00:28:14.892
Hats off.

205
00:28:17.062 --> 00:28:19.223
What's all this about?

206
00:28:21.967 --> 00:28:25.300
- What's this?
- It's the phantom, sir.

207
00:28:25.404 --> 00:28:29.170
Excuse me. That's what the men call it.
It's the Acheron, sir.

208
00:28:29.275 --> 00:28:32.176
You see, Will here,
he seen her being built.

209
00:28:32.278 --> 00:28:37.443
In Boston, sir. During the peace.
But she's Yankee-built, sir.

210
00:28:37.516 --> 00:28:41.450
He was getting married, and his wife's
second cousin works in the yards,

211
00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.784
so Will here saw the ship out of water.

212
00:28:43.856 --> 00:28:49.123
Sir, I saw there was something right
strange about her, so I asked Joe…

213
00:28:49.194 --> 00:28:52.493
So he described it to me
and I knocked you up a model, sir.

214
00:28:52.598 --> 00:28:57.331
- And this framing is accurate?
- Exactly accurate, sir.

215
00:28:57.436 --> 00:28:59.996
- Thank you, lads.
- Thank you, sir.

216
00:29:00.105 --> 00:29:03.336
Killick, an extra ration
of rum for these men.

217
00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:05.842
Thank you very much, sir.

218
00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:08.937
- Which I was saving for Salutin' Day.
- We'll drink wine.

219
00:29:09.014 --> 00:29:11.141
Oh, drink wine on Salutin' Day.

220
00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:13.878
Bluff above the water and sharp below.

221
00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:19.390
Gives the hull a finer entry and a long run
as she goes aft. That's why she's so fast.

222
00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:22.119
Heavier, but fast despite it.

223
00:29:23.162 --> 00:29:28.497
That's the future.
What a fascinating modern age we live in.

224
00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:32.468
Planking and framing like that
would make her hull 2ft thick. Solid oak.

225
00:29:32.538 --> 00:29:37.498
That's why we couldn't dent her. She's
probably capable of making 12 to 14 knots.

226
00:29:38.177 --> 00:29:41.510
Now we know. Thank God for Warley
and his wife's second cousin.

227
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.549
She could be doing up to 280 miles a day.

228
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:50.680
Even if we did catch up with her,
I mean, to take her…

229
00:29:50.756 --> 00:29:54.886
She's out of our class.
She's a 44-gun ship.

230
00:29:56.495 --> 00:30:00.932
She's still vulnerable at the stern,
like the rest of us.

231
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.706
Hello, darling. How much for a kiss?

232
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.509
Quanto cost-o kiss-o?

233
00:30:20.586 --> 00:30:23.783
- Name?
- My name is Maria.

234
00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:27.188
Give us arrows. I give ax. Quick, mate.

235
00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:29.523
Thank you, mate.

236
00:30:38.137 --> 00:30:41.072
Gangway for the mail, please.

237
00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:45.608
Here we are. Very important mail. Letters.

238
00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:48.976
What's he saying?

239
00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:56.418
A large man-of-war, French, stopped here
on the 10th, then headed south.

240
00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:03.992
Somewhere here.

241
00:31:04.096 --> 00:31:06.656
A full three weeks ahead.

242
00:31:06.765 --> 00:31:08.630
Damn.

243
00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:12.332
All right, Tom, let's get
all this squared away.

244
00:31:12.438 --> 00:31:16.340
Aye, sir. Mr Hollar.
Let us complete our business here.

245
00:31:16.442 --> 00:31:19.172
Hands, prepare to weigh anchor.

246
00:31:21.146 --> 00:31:23.283
Put that woman down, Slade.

247
00:31:23.354 --> 00:31:28.418
This is a ship of His Majesty's Navy,
not a floating bordello.

248
00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:35.286
All hands, get these provisions stowed.

249
00:31:47.773 --> 00:31:49.365
Well done.

250
00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:51.534
Gentlemen.

251
00:31:52.544 --> 00:31:57.538
To wives and to sweethearts.

252
00:31:57.649 --> 00:32:01.016
May they never meet.

253
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.022
Mr Howard, the bottle.
The bottle stands by you, sir.

254
00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:07.956
Sir?

255
00:32:08.794 --> 00:32:13.356
Excuse me, sir, but Mr Blakeney said that
you served under Lord Nelson at the Nile.

256
00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:18.368
Indeed. I was a young lieutenant,
not much older than you are now.

257
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.031
And Mr Pullings was
a sniveling midshipman,

258
00:32:22.141 --> 00:32:24.506
still yearning for hearth and home.

259
00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:27.739
Did you meet him, sir?
Can you tell me what he's like?

260
00:32:27.846 --> 00:32:30.974
I have had the honor
of dining with him twice.

261
00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:33.916
He spoke to me on both occasions.

262
00:32:34.019 --> 00:32:37.182
A master tactician
and a man of singular vision.

263
00:32:37.256 --> 00:32:42.523
He always said in battle "Never mind
the maneuvers, just go straight at 'em."

264
00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:46.758
Some would say not a great seaman,
but a great leader.

265
00:32:46.865 --> 00:32:49.891
He's England's only hope
if old Boney intends to invade.

266
00:32:50.002 --> 00:32:53.369
Sir, might we press you for an anecdote?

267
00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:59.401
The first time that he spoke to me,

268
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:04.710
I shall never forget his words.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

269
00:33:04.783 --> 00:33:08.549
He leaned across the table,
he looked me straight in the eye,

270
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:13.284
and he said
"Aubrey, may I trouble you for the salt?"

271
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.525
I've always tried to say it
exactly as he did ever since.

272
00:33:26.305 --> 00:33:31.707
The second time,
the second time he told me a story

273
00:33:31.777 --> 00:33:35.304
about how someone offered him
a boat cloak on a cold night.

274
00:33:35.414 --> 00:33:40.283
And he said no, he didn't need it.
That he was quite warm.

275
00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:45.049
His zeal for king
and country kept him warm.

276
00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:49.150
I know it sounds absurd,
and were it from another man,

277
00:33:49.261 --> 00:33:54.563
you'd cry out "What pitiful stuff"
and dismiss it as mere enthusiasm.

278
00:33:54.633 --> 00:33:56.726
But with Nelson,

279
00:33:58.604 --> 00:34:01.437
you felt your heart glow.

280
00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:12.739
- Wouldn't you say, Mr Pullings?
- You did indeed, sir.

281
00:34:13.318 --> 00:34:19.780
Well then, he would seem to be the exception
to the rule that authority corrupts.

282
00:34:19.858 --> 00:34:23.191
To Lord Nelson.

283
00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:30.332
Do you see those two weevils, Doctor?

284
00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:31.959
I do.

285
00:34:32.037 --> 00:34:34.369
Which would you choose?

286
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:41.310
Neither. There's no difference between them.
They're the same species of curculio.

287
00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.812
If you had to choose.

288
00:34:43.882 --> 00:34:47.340
If you were forced to make a choice.
If there was no other…

289
00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:51.047
Well then, if you're going to push me,

290
00:34:53.358 --> 00:34:56.350
I would choose the right-hand weevil.

291
00:34:56.461 --> 00:35:00.192
It has significant advantage
in both length and breadth.

292
00:35:00.299 --> 00:35:03.632
There, I have you.
You're completely dished.

293
00:35:03.702 --> 00:35:09.641
Do you not know that in the service one must
always choose the lesser of two weevils?

294
00:35:16.315 --> 00:35:19.716
He who would pun would pick a pocket.

295
00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:23.483
Really. Weevils.

296
00:35:23.555 --> 00:35:28.891
To the lesser of two weevils.

297
00:35:39.538 --> 00:35:42.507
Yay, Joe.

298
00:35:45.043 --> 00:35:47.102
Go on, Joe.

299
00:36:05.764 --> 00:36:08.062
The Lord taketh,

300
00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:12.200
and the Lord giveth away.

301
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.137
You hear that? He said something.

302
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.107
Doctor. He spoke, Doctor.

303
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.110
Well done indeed, Stephen.

304
00:36:20.212 --> 00:36:23.204
Adieu to you Spanish ladies

305
00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:27.411
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain

306
00:36:27.486 --> 00:36:32.421
For we've received orders
to sail for old England

307
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:38.657
We hope in a short time
to see you again

308
00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:43.728
What a wonderfully true voice
Mr Hollom possesses.

309
00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:46.327
Indeed.

310
00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:50.168
Come, all you bold young thoughtless men

311
00:36:50.275 --> 00:36:52.766
A warning take by me

312
00:36:52.844 --> 00:36:57.440
And never leave your happy homes
to sail the raging sea

313
00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:12.322
On deck there. Sail ho.

314
00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:15.493
Looks like a frigate.

315
00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:22.198
How did it get there?

316
00:37:22.307 --> 00:37:25.970
- We must turn and fight.
- But he has the weather gauge again.

317
00:37:26.044 --> 00:37:29.343
He must've been watching us
from some inlet.

318
00:37:33.318 --> 00:37:36.845
My God. What can we do?
He has us by the hip.

319
00:37:36.955 --> 00:37:38.946
Run like smoke and oakum.

320
00:37:39.024 --> 00:37:40.481
We'll have to bend every sail.

321
00:37:40.552 --> 00:37:42.958
We'll put up our
handkerchiefs if we have to.

322
00:37:43.028 --> 00:37:44.505
We must survive this day.

323
00:37:44.576 --> 00:37:46.987
Let's get about it.
Mr Allen, gentlemen.

324
00:37:47.065 --> 00:37:49.124
All hands, make sail.

325
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:54.138
This is the second time he's done this to me.
There will not be a third.

326
00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:15.755
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel
of that there phantom ship.

327
00:38:15.861 --> 00:38:18.261
You better hold fast.

328
00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:26.697
What is it with this man?

329
00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:30.832
Did I kill a relative of his in
battle, perhaps?

330
00:38:30.903 --> 00:38:32.573
His boy, God forbid?

331
00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:34.702
He fights like you, Jack.

332
00:38:53.298 --> 00:38:56.231
Bring the sun down to the horizon.

333
00:38:56.301 --> 00:39:00.533
When its lower limb is touching the horizon…
Williamson, look to your sextant.

334
00:39:00.605 --> 00:39:04.473
When the orb is no longer rising,

335
00:39:04.576 --> 00:39:08.137
then it has reached its zenith
and that would be noon.

336
00:39:08.246 --> 00:39:10.612
- Sir?
- Mr Pullings.

337
00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:12.910
- Do you make noon, Mr Hollom?
- Yes, sir.

338
00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:15.475
Call noon. It's your class.

339
00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:21.156
- Sir, that's noon.
- Mr Nichols, make that twelve.

340
00:39:21.259 --> 00:39:23.591
Six hours?

341
00:39:23.662 --> 00:39:25.926
Five at most.

342
00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:29.956
Just keep us out of her
reach until nightfall.

343
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:43.012
She's to look like us, lads, don't forget.
Jibbo, make fast those whips.

344
00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:46.572
We didn't want to make it any taller,
on account of this wind.

345
00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:52.783
- Excuse me, sir, but what are they building?
- Your first command.

346
00:39:58.663 --> 00:40:01.029
Quickly. She'll be on top of us.

347
00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:04.033
Take the weight on the yard tackles.

348
00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:06.433
Fend her off.

349
00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:08.995
Lower away on the main.

350
00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:19.144
- Wouldn't want to lose you.
- Aye, sir.

351
00:40:30.228 --> 00:40:35.791
There's a painter. Pass her aft.
Outside everything, mind.

352
00:40:35.867 --> 00:40:40.167
Lively now. We've not ten minutes
before he's up with us.

353
00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:50.178
- Mind what the captain told you.
- Pull, boys. That's it.

354
00:41:13.738 --> 00:41:14.762
Now.

355
00:41:20.445 --> 00:41:23.380
Killick there. Douse your light.

356
00:41:29.788 --> 00:41:31.415
Mr Allen, make ready.

357
00:42:12.564 --> 00:42:15.055
Hello. We caught a fish.

358
00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:18.501
Take the helm, Bonden.

359
00:42:18.603 --> 00:42:22.300
- Now, tell me that wasn't fun.
- Yes, sir.

360
00:42:24.075 --> 00:42:26.771
Hard a'larboard.

361
00:42:55.673 --> 00:43:00.167
Stand the men down, Mr Pullings.
I'll take this watch.

362
00:43:00.278 --> 00:43:01.870
Aye, sir.

363
00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:06.542
Mr Mowett, Mr Allen, calmly now.
You know his orders.

364
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:08.710
Well done, sir.

365
00:43:10.522 --> 00:43:12.163
She's a right phantom, she is.

366
00:43:12.234 --> 00:43:15.118
The way she come up again,
right behind us like that.

367
00:43:15.193 --> 00:43:20.529
Out of nowhere. And right behind us.
Like that first time, out the fog.

368
00:43:20.632 --> 00:43:23.123
With our shot bouncin' off her.

369
00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:26.167
Captain's not called
Lucky Jack for no reason.

370
00:43:26.237 --> 00:43:30.333
Phantom or no, she's a privateer,
and Lucky Jack'll have her.

371
00:43:30.408 --> 00:43:33.343
You need more than luck 'gainst a phantom.

372
00:43:35.146 --> 00:43:38.377
- Is she like a pirate?
- No, they're not pirates, Lofty.

373
00:43:38.483 --> 00:43:43.011
Oh, no. If they were,
we could hang them when we catch 'em.

374
00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:45.885
Privateer gets a piece of paper
from the Frenchies

375
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.652
says they can hunt down
anything with our flag.

376
00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:52.389
They go after rich
merchantmen and the like.

377
00:43:52.497 --> 00:43:56.228
But think on our share of the prize money.

378
00:43:56.334 --> 00:44:01.328
She'll be loaded with gold
and ambergris and all the gems of Araby.

379
00:44:01.406 --> 00:44:04.898
That's all very well, Nagle.
Got to get home to spend it, but.

380
00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:07.341
Never met a dead man
who bought me a drink.

381
00:44:07.412 --> 00:44:11.371
And I've never met a live one
that you bought one for, neither.

382
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.345
Sitting up all night,
catching your death of cold.

383
00:44:16.416 --> 00:44:18.882
That's the last of the coffee, too.

384
00:44:18.957 --> 00:44:21.050
Thank you, Killick.

385
00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:27.421
Bonden.

386
00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:30.695
That's enough easting.
Set a course sou'-sou'west.

387
00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:34.761
Aye, sir. Sou'-sou'west.

388
00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:41.278
Sail.

389
00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:44.576
Two points off starboard bow.

390
00:44:45.116 --> 00:44:47.584
Three cheers for Lucky Jack.

391
00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:56.091
She's ours, boys.

392
00:45:05.837 --> 00:45:10.001
Foul. You got away before me.

393
00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:17.147
- Set royals and courses.
- Sir.

394
00:45:17.248 --> 00:45:19.739
Have the idlers placed along the rails.

395
00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:21.783
I've never seen the like.

396
00:45:21.853 --> 00:45:25.812
It has to be more than 100 sea miles
and he brings us up on his tail.

397
00:45:25.924 --> 00:45:30.088
That's seamanship, Mr Pullings.
My God, that's seamanship.

398
00:45:30.161 --> 00:45:33.494
Told you it would work, Will.
We'll have them by nightfall.

399
00:45:33.598 --> 00:45:37.090
- I think we've got him, sir.
- And the wind favors us this time.

400
00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:40.467
Don't count your eggs
before they're in the pudding.

401
00:45:40.538 --> 00:45:45.473
Still, if we can close this gap and
get up behind her, she may well be ours.

402
00:45:45.543 --> 00:45:47.943
Touch wood. Scratch a stay.

403
00:45:48.546 --> 00:45:52.141
Turn three times.
May the Lord and saints preserve us.

404
00:46:07.632 --> 00:46:09.327
Turn.

405
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.234
Move along, man.
We'll have lost him before you rig it up.

406
00:46:13.338 --> 00:46:15.465
Hold.

407
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.835
- 12 knots, sir.
- That's 12 knots. That's good.

408
00:46:19.911 --> 00:46:21.077
I want more.

409
00:46:21.148 --> 00:46:24.575
Have all the spare hands
placed on the windward rail.

410
00:46:24.682 --> 00:46:27.981
Mr Hollar. Rouse up the off-watch.

411
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.253
All hands on starboard rail.

412
00:46:32.924 --> 00:46:36.325
Come up the larboard topsail sheets.

413
00:46:53.945 --> 00:46:58.405
- We're crackin' on.
- We'll be crackin' up if he don't watch it.

414
00:46:58.516 --> 00:47:03.112
Captain knows this ship.
He knows what she can take.

415
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:11.726
Mr Hollar, I want lifelines fore and aft.

416
00:47:11.796 --> 00:47:13.525
No lounging, boy.

417
00:47:13.598 --> 00:47:19.298
Lifelines, fore and aft.
Double-grape that launch.

418
00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:23.939
Cape Horn, Doctor.

419
00:47:39.757 --> 00:47:42.749
Close the lid.
There's enough water in the grog.

420
00:47:42.827 --> 00:47:44.726
Thank you for that, Davies.

421
00:47:44.796 --> 00:47:49.665
Reckon the captain will follow him
round the Horn, every stitch of canvas flying?

422
00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:52.233
I reckon he'd follow him
to the gates of hell.

423
00:47:52.303 --> 00:47:56.831
It's a devil ship, I tell ya.
And it's leadin' us right into a trap.

424
00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:03.111
She's making a run for the Horn, sir.

425
00:48:03.181 --> 00:48:06.150
I'll not vouch for this mast.
Not around the Horn.

426
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.276
Thank you. Your comments
will be noted in the log.

427
00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:11.799
Sail trimmers to their stations.

428
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:15.622
Get the sails off her, lads.
She's over-pressed.

429
00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:17.854
Give 'em a pull and belay.

430
00:48:33.344 --> 00:48:36.836
We're closing on her, Tom.
I'll not give up now.

431
00:48:36.948 --> 00:48:40.179
Come up on the wind, Barret.
Set a course sou'west by west.

432
00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:42.878
Sou'west by west, sir.

433
00:48:44.055 --> 00:48:45.784
Mr Calamy.

434
00:48:45.857 --> 00:48:48.553
Idlers and waisters below.

435
00:48:52.363 --> 00:48:55.161
We're for the Horn, boys.

436
00:48:59.137 --> 00:49:01.071
Close reef topsails.

437
00:49:14.585 --> 00:49:16.348
Lively, lads.

438
00:49:20.658 --> 00:49:25.425
Batten down those hatches
before we're on the bottom.

439
00:49:35.006 --> 00:49:37.839
Johansson, Truelove. To the mizzen.

440
00:49:39.243 --> 00:49:41.175
All secure.

441
00:49:41.245 --> 00:49:43.213
Down ye go, lads.

442
00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:54.386
Mr Hollom, help young Warley
on the mizzen topgallant.

443
00:49:57.862 --> 00:50:01.229
- I'll need more men, sir.
- Yes. Go.

444
00:50:09.574 --> 00:50:13.271
Mr Hollom, sir. Help me.

445
00:50:20.084 --> 00:50:23.747
Tudor, Ellers. To Mr Allen.

446
00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:28.815
You men, lay aloft.
The mizzen topgallant. Light along.

447
00:50:36.767 --> 00:50:38.826
Help.

448
00:50:41.906 --> 00:50:43.931
Help me.

449
00:50:49.814 --> 00:50:52.578
Man overboard.

450
00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:58.245
Mizzen's gone. Hands to the taffrail.

451
00:51:09.333 --> 00:51:12.200
He's over there, sir.

452
00:51:12.303 --> 00:51:15.966
Swim for the wreckage, man. Swim.

453
00:51:16.774 --> 00:51:18.469
Over here.

454
00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:23.844
Mr Allen, gratings and barrels,
anything that floats, overboard.

455
00:51:23.948 --> 00:51:28.044
She's broaching. We're losing her.

456
00:51:28.152 --> 00:51:31.485
Sir, the wreckage is acting
as a sea anchor.

457
00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:35.116
We must cut it loose.
It's going to sink us.

458
00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:39.026
Sir, he's going to make it. He can do it.

459
00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:43.157
- Come on, Will.
- Come on. Hand over hand.

460
00:51:43.234 --> 00:51:48.399
For God's sake, Will, swim.
Swim for the wreckage, Will.

461
00:51:57.048 --> 00:51:58.980
You can do it, Will.

462
00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:03.214
- Swim. Come on.
- Come on, Will. Swim.

463
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:36.303
- He's been at it again.
- Who's that, then?

464
00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:39.206
- The Jonah.
- What's that?

465
00:54:49.587 --> 00:54:54.047
The deaths in actual battle
are the easiest to bear.

466
00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.524
For my own part,

467
00:54:56.595 --> 00:55:01.823
those who die under my knife,
or from some subsequent infection,

468
00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:07.838
I have to remind myself that it was
the enemy that killed them, not me.

469
00:55:10.007 --> 00:55:12.601
That young man was a casualty of war.

470
00:55:15.346 --> 00:55:19.578
As you said yourself,
you have to choose the lesser of two evils.

471
00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:21.742
Weevils.

472
00:55:25.189 --> 00:55:29.592
The crew will take it badly.
Warley was popular.

473
00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:33.754
Have they expressed
any feelings on the matter to you?

474
00:55:41.038 --> 00:55:44.064
Jack, before answering,
I'm compelled to ask,

475
00:55:44.141 --> 00:55:48.271
am I speaking with my old friend
or to the ship's captain?

476
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.975
To the captain I'd say there's little
I detest more than an informer.

477
00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:56.314
- Now you're talking like an Irishman.
- I am an Irishman.

478
00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.445
As a friend, then.

479
00:55:58.556 --> 00:56:04.391
As a friend, I would say that I have never
once doubted your abilities as a captain.

480
00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.395
Speak plainly, Stephen.

481
00:56:08.165 --> 00:56:12.898
Perhaps we should have
turned back weeks ago.

482
00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:16.838
The men, of course
they would follow Lucky Jack anywhere,

483
00:56:16.941 --> 00:56:19.171
rightfully confident of victory.

484
00:56:19.276 --> 00:56:24.908
But therein lies the problem.
You're not accustomed to defeat.

485
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:32.650
And chasing this larger, faster ship with its
long guns is beginning to smack of pride.

486
00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:36.157
It's not a question of pride.
It is a question of duty.

487
00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.694
Duty. Yes, I've heard it well spoken of.

488
00:56:38.796 --> 00:56:40.180
Be as satiric as you like.

489
00:56:40.251 --> 00:56:43.426
Viewing the world through a
microscope is your prerogative.

490
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.632
This is a ship of war.

491
00:56:44.703 --> 00:56:48.028
I will grind whatever grist the
mill requires to fulfill my duty.

492
00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.504
Whatever the cost?

493
00:56:50.608 --> 00:56:52.838
Whatever the cost.

494
00:56:52.943 --> 00:56:55.707
To follow orders with no regard for cost.

495
00:56:55.813 --> 00:57:00.113
Can you really claim there's
nothing personal in this call to duty?

496
00:57:00.184 --> 00:57:02.675
Orders are subject
to the requirement of the service.

497
00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:09.055
My orders were to follow him as far as Brazil.
I exceeded my orders a long time ago.

498
00:57:11.295 --> 00:57:13.354
Got it.

499
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.892
The wind's backing, sir.

500
00:57:20.004 --> 00:57:24.031
Sir, we just can't hold
this westerly course any longer.

501
00:57:24.642 --> 00:57:30.672
If we can't sail through the damn wind, Tom,
we'll bloody well sail around it. Due south.

502
00:57:30.748 --> 00:57:33.740
How far south, sir?

503
00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:37.378
As far as is necessary, Mr Pullings.

504
00:57:37.488 --> 00:57:39.922
- Aye, sir.
- Lively.

505
00:57:41.025 --> 00:57:45.189
- Due south, please, Mr Bonden.
- Due south, sir.

506
00:57:47.731 --> 00:57:50.894
Heave. Steady.

507
00:58:26.203 --> 00:58:30.537
Clearly something nautical and fascinating
just happened. I am at a loss.

508
00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:35.101
We have made our turn northward.
We are headed back toward the sun.

509
00:58:35.212 --> 00:58:37.271
To the sun.

510
00:58:39.917 --> 00:58:43.546
And by way of anticipation of this event,

511
00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:49.252
I have asked Killick
to prepare something special.

512
00:58:49.326 --> 00:58:53.626
- Killick. Killick there.
- I'm already here, ain't I?

513
00:58:56.133 --> 00:59:00.331
Gentlemen, I give you,

514
00:59:01.138 --> 00:59:03.436
our destination.

515
00:59:09.747 --> 00:59:13.478
- It's the Galapagos Islands.
- The Galapagos Islands.

516
00:59:16.086 --> 00:59:18.350
Our whaling fleet is there.

517
00:59:18.455 --> 00:59:23.916
And their cargo would put a pretty penny
into old Bones-aparte's invasion purse.

518
00:59:23.994 --> 00:59:29.694
That's where the Acheron will be.
Sure as there's carts to horses.

519
00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.462
So, Mr Pullings, if you'll permit me,

520
00:59:32.536 --> 00:59:35.528
a slice of Albemarle.

521
00:59:36.507 --> 00:59:40.136
And for you, Doctor, Redondo Rock.

522
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:41.541
Perfect.

523
00:59:41.645 --> 00:59:44.375
And the Acheron for me.

524
00:59:50.554 --> 00:59:55.821
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

525
00:59:55.893 --> 01:00:00.853
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

526
01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:07.199
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

527
01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:12.639
Don't forget your old shipmates

528
01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:18.145
We have worked the selfsame gun
Quarterdeck division

529
01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:23.881
Sponger I, and loader you
Through the whole commission

530
01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:30.357
Long we tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack

531
01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:37.697
Don't forget your old shipmates

532
01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:23.732
The Enchanted Isles.

533
01:01:23.803 --> 01:01:28.887
They're said to be full of
strange and wonderful beasts.

534
01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:32.747
When we get there,
we'll have to stop for food and water.

535
01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:36.782
I promise you, during that time -
several days at least -

536
01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:41.297
you can wander at will, collecting bugs
and beetles to your heart's content.

537
01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:45.892
You'll be the first naturalist
to set foot on the islands, I'll wager.

538
01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:49.336
I would like that of all things.

539
01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:56.241
- Is it an insect?
- Yes.

540
01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:02.916
Doesn't look like one.
I mean, it looks like a stick.

541
01:02:03.687 --> 01:02:06.086
Yes, that's the whole point.

542
01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:10.115
It's disguised itself in order to survive.

543
01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:18.795
There's a spider
that's disguised itself as an ant.

544
01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:26.173
And here's an insect that's taken on the shape
of a thorn to save itself from the birds.

545
01:02:27.678 --> 01:02:29.873
Did God make them change?

546
01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.347
Does God make them change?
Yes, certainly.

547
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.886
But do they also change themselves?

548
01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:39.820
Now that is a question, isn't it?

549
01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.520
Sir, we've raised the Galapagos.

550
01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:46.687
I'm coming.

551
01:03:21.565 --> 01:03:25.365
- Look. Beyond the rock.
- Yes, I see.

552
01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:29.098
What is it? Curious, eh?
Some type of gull?

553
01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:34.667
- There's an ugly devil.
- Disgusting. It's got warts all over it.

554
01:03:34.745 --> 01:03:37.714
Ugly devils, aren't they?

555
01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:41.344
I can't see any women.
Just ducks and lizards.

556
01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:44.353
What, no women? It ain't natural.

557
01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:47.554
How extraordinary.

558
01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:49.455
What is, sir?

559
01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.566
Those birds.

560
01:03:50.637 --> 01:03:53.586
They're a species of cormorant,
but they are flightless.

561
01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:56.359
Do you see their underdeveloped wings?

562
01:03:56.433 --> 01:04:00.028
By all that's holy,
I think that's unknown to science.

563
01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:03.903
The dragons don't seem to bother them.

564
01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:08.978
They're a type of iguana, I should think.
Therefore, they're vegetarian.

565
01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:12.139
- Will you catch one?
- A pair of them, I should think.

566
01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:15.446
Then you can present
one of their offspring to the king.

567
01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:19.249
- Look. There's one going for a swim.
- Iguanas don't swim.

568
01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.586
These ones do.

569
01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:32.761
I'll be damned.

570
01:04:32.836 --> 01:04:39.139
Two new species in as many minutes.
That's remarkable.

571
01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:03.907
All hands about ship.

572
01:05:03.978 --> 01:05:07.529
Off tacks and sheets.
Prepare the mainsail to haul.

573
01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:20.308
- Aubrey.
- Hogg. Master of the Albatross.

574
01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:23.841
God bless you, Captain.
God bless you all.

575
01:05:24.855 --> 01:05:27.821
- Mr Calamy, food and water for these men.
- Aye, sir.

576
01:05:27.891 --> 01:05:31.349
- Mr Howard, stand your men down.
- Royal Marines, trail arms.

577
01:05:32.229 --> 01:05:35.289
We was coming back for fresh lines
no more than a week ago.

578
01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:37.010
Hid in that inlet yonder.

579
01:05:37.081 --> 01:05:40.826
Burnt our bloody ship to the waterline.
Fucking pirates.

580
01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:43.202
Crew prisoner, captain dead.

581
01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:47.402
She were a big black three-master.
Break your heart, it would.

582
01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:50.692
$12,000 sterling of the
finest grade oil they took.

583
01:05:50.763 --> 01:05:52.710
We been out more than two years.

584
01:05:52.816 --> 01:05:54.716
And her course?

585
01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:57.981
Maybe a point south of west,
following the rest of the fleet.

586
01:05:58.054 --> 01:06:01.251
Mr Pullings, enter these men's names
into the ship's books.

587
01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:04.555
Mr Allen, set a course. West by south.

588
01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:06.891
All hands, make sail.

589
01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:10.023
Sir, should we not take
on fresh provisions?

590
01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.228
Mr Mowett, there's not a moment to lose.

591
01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:33.413
- Have you forgotten your promise?
- Subject to the requirements of the service.

592
01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:36.720
I cannot delay for the sake
of an iguana or a giant peccary.

593
01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:40.251
Fascinating, no doubt,
but of no immediate application.

594
01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:44.390
There is, I think, an opportunity here
to serve both our purposes.

595
01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:47.595
As I understand it,
this is a long, thin island.

596
01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:51.231
You need to sail around it.
I could walk across it.

597
01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:55.242
I have known you to spend hours
staring into a deserted bird's nest.

598
01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:59.271
I could walk briskly,
pausing only for important measurements.

599
01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:03.546
Making discoveries that could advance
our knowledge of natural history.

600
01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.716
If wind and tide had been against us,
I should have said yes.

601
01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:10.988
They're not. I'm obliged to say no.

602
01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:16.393
I see. So after all this
time in your service,

603
01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:21.335
I must simply content myself to form
part of this belligerent expedition,

604
01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:26.432
hurry past wonders, bent on destruction.
I say nothing of the corruption of power…

605
01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:30.104
- You forget yourself, Doctor.
- No, Jack.

606
01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.691
You've forgotten yourself.

607
01:07:31.762 --> 01:07:34.480
For my part,
I look upon a promise as binding.

608
01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:38.918
The promise was conditional.
I command a king's ship, not a private yacht.

609
01:07:38.989 --> 01:07:43.119
We do not have time for
your damned hobbies, sir.

610
01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:13.522
All right.

611
01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:21.055
Get those fish below.
Sluice down this deck.

612
01:08:21.164 --> 01:08:24.395
Davies, don't leave them there.
Get them below.

613
01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:26.162
Mr Blakeney.

614
01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:30.468
Sir, I found a curious beetle
walking along the deck.

615
01:08:33.677 --> 01:08:36.510
I think it's a Galapagos beetle.

616
01:08:37.547 --> 01:08:39.310
I'm sure of it.

617
01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:45.682
Were you to walk all day on the island,
you might never come across it.

618
01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:51.190
Yes, that is more than likely sure.

619
01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:54.362
You can have it, sir.

620
01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:13.341
Mr Blakeney.

621
01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:17.577
- Thank you.
- Sir.

622
01:09:31.034 --> 01:09:33.025
Last gun fired, sir.

623
01:09:33.103 --> 01:09:36.732
- Timing?
- Two minutes and one second, sir.

624
01:09:36.806 --> 01:09:42.142
Lads, that's not good enough.
We need to fire two broadsides to her one.

625
01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:45.442
- Want to see a guillotine in Piccadilly?
- No.

626
01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:48.745
- Do you want to call Napoleon your king?
- No.

627
01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:51.582
- Want your children to sing The Marseillaise?
- No.

628
01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:54.919
Mr Mowett, Mr Pullings, starboard battery.

629
01:09:57.961 --> 01:10:01.260
Jump to it, lads. Cadence and rhythm.

630
01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:07.266
- Mark your targets.
- Come on, lads, faster now.

631
01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:09.430
Come on, swab it.

632
01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:23.651
Heave.

633
01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:26.950
- Report, Mr Mowett.
- Third and fourth divisions ready.

634
01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:29.924
Right. Starboard battery, fire!

635
01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:05.988
One minute and ten seconds.

636
01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:10.493
Well done, lads.
Extra grog for all of you.

637
01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:17.071
Gangway for the captain, lads.

638
01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:19.835
Marked improvement, Mr Calamy. Well done.

639
01:11:19.909 --> 01:11:22.002
Thank you, sir.

640
01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:33.820
Killick. Killick there.
What do you have for us tonight?

641
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.415
Which it's soused hog's face.

642
01:11:36.526 --> 01:11:41.190
- Which it is soused hog's face.
- My favorite.

643
01:11:41.264 --> 01:11:47.897
And when they run, the Surprise
will blow her to kingdom come.

644
01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:47.627
One more week of this and
they'd give it up for a cup of water.

645
01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.891
I can't make it rain.

646
01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:55.295
I can harness the wind,
but I ain't its goddamn creator.

647
01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:58.067
I have never known
such a run of bad luck.

648
01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:20.329
"And they said unto him
'For what caused the evil?"'

649
01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.499
Where'd that come from?

650
01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.137
It's from the Bible, that.

651
01:13:29.208 --> 01:13:32.340
That is from the Bible.
The story of the Jonah.

652
01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:36.309
They found out on their ship
that one of their men - this Jonah cove -

653
01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:39.439
he'd offended God
and was the cause of all their bad luck.

654
01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:45.147
Evil comes from him
who evil thinks and evil is.

655
01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:49.954
No. Joe knows a thing or two about evil.

656
01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:54.490
From personal experience. Right, Joe?

657
01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:07.568
It's like Killick says.

658
01:14:07.639 --> 01:14:11.644
Morning of the battle,
he doesn't have the guts to beat to quarters.

659
01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:16.344
Then his entire gun crew's killed.
Soon as he went up the mizzen, Will falls.

660
01:14:16.419 --> 01:14:20.219
And whose watch was it
when we lost our wind?

661
01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:45.206
You there. Stand fast.

662
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:51.514
Master-at-arms, take that man below
and clap him in irons.

663
01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:55.114
Mr Pullings, defaulters at eight bells.

664
01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.919
Aye, sir.

665
01:14:58.361 --> 01:15:01.694
Bring Hollom down to my cabin.

666
01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:08.967
A man pushed past you,
yet you said nothing. Why?

667
01:15:09.072 --> 01:15:11.973
I intended to, sir,
but the right words didn't…

668
01:15:12.075 --> 01:15:17.274
The right words?
He was deliberately insubordinate.

669
01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.440
I've tried to get to know the men, sir,
and be friendly,

670
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:23.986
but they've taken a set against me.

671
01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:29.489
Always whispering when I go past
and giving me looks.

672
01:15:29.592 --> 01:15:32.493
I'll set that to rights.
I'll be much tougher on them.

673
01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:36.122
You don't make friends
with the foremastjacks, lad.

674
01:15:36.232 --> 01:15:40.498
They'll despise you in the end,
think you weak.

675
01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:44.300
- Nor do you need to be a tyrant.
- No, sir.

676
01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:46.671
I'm very sorry, sir.

677
01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:50.177
- You're 26? 27?
- I'm 30 next Friday, sir.

678
01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:51.837
30?

679
01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:55.179
You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice.

680
01:15:55.284 --> 01:16:00.153
I know you have, but you're not a bad sailor.
You can't spend your life a midshipman.

681
01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:03.851
No, sir. I will try much harder, sir.

682
01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:08.829
Look, Hollom,
it's leadership they want.

683
01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.956
Strength.

684
01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:16.494
You find that within yourself,
and you will earn their respect.

685
01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:21.668
Without respect,
true discipline goes by the board.

686
01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:25.543
Yes, sir.

687
01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:30.711
Strength, respect and discipline, sir.

688
01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:38.616
It's an unfortunate business, Hollom.

689
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:42.462
Damned unfortunate.

690
01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:46.066
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

691
01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:53.331
- I am not a flogging captain.
- Hollom is a scapegoat for all the bad luck,

692
01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:56.708
real or imagined, on this voyage.

693
01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:59.338
Mr Lamb? If you please.

694
01:16:59.415 --> 01:17:02.680
They're exhausted.
These men are exhausted.

695
01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:05.651
You've pushed them too hard.

696
01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:09.384
Stephen, I invite you
to this cabin as my friend.

697
01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:13.758
Not to criticize nor to comment
on my command.

698
01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:19.392
Shall I leave you until you're
in a more harmonious frame of mind?

699
01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:24.436
- What would you have me do?
- Tip the ship's grog over the side.

700
01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.998
- Stop their grog?
- Nagle was drunk when he insulted Hollom.

701
01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:31.376
Stop 200 years of privilege and tradition.

702
01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:34.610
I'd rather have them three sheets
to the wind than face a mutiny.

703
01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:37.015
I'm rather understanding of mutinies.

704
01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:41.921
Men pressed from their homes,
confined for months aboard a wooden prison…

705
01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:48.793
I respect your right to disagree with me,
but I can only afford one rebel on this ship.

706
01:17:50.233 --> 01:17:53.137
I hate it when you talk of
the service in this way.

707
01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:54.533
It makes me so very low.

708
01:17:54.604 --> 01:17:56.367
You think I want to flog Nagle?

709
01:17:56.439 --> 01:18:00.034
A man who hacked the ropes
that sent his mate to his death?

710
01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:02.976
Under my orders?

711
01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:07.413
Do you not see? The only things that keep
this wooden world together are hard work…

712
01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:09.916
Jack, the man failed to salute.

713
01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:12.716
There's hierarchies even in nature.

714
01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:18.055
- There is no disdain in nature. There is no…
- Men must be governed.

715
01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:20.652
Often not wisely,
but governed nonetheless.

716
01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:25.063
That's the excuse of every tyrant
in history, from Nero to Bonaparte.

717
01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:29.264
I, for one, am opposed to authority.
It is an egg of misery and oppression.

718
01:18:29.338 --> 01:18:33.798
You've come to the wrong shop
for anarchy, brother.

719
01:18:36.646 --> 01:18:38.477
Four.

720
01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:41.314
Five.

721
01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:45.280
Six.

722
01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:48.319
Seven.

723
01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:51.116
Eight.

724
01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:53.590
Nine.

725
01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:57.830
Ten.

726
01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:00.129
Eleven.

727
01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:04.139
Twelve.

728
01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:09.338
Cut him down.

729
01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.668
Not so loud.

730
01:20:29.792 --> 01:20:32.454
Put that dirk down, Boyle.

731
01:20:34.964 --> 01:20:37.558
You OK, Mr Hollom?

732
01:20:37.633 --> 01:20:40.727
- He's not ill, just dodging work as usual.
- Shut up.

733
01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:43.897
- You shut up.
- Just leave him be.

734
01:20:43.973 --> 01:20:46.965
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

735
01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:53.545
Sir, it's Mr Hollom.

736
01:21:00.656 --> 01:21:06.617
There's nothing physically wrong with him.
He thinks he's been cursed.

737
01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:12.094
Sailors can abide a great deal,
but not a Jonah.

738
01:21:12.768 --> 01:21:15.828
My God. You believe it too.

739
01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:20.964
Not everything is in your books, Stephen.

740
01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:29.417
It's him, innit?

741
01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:34.979
The Jonah.

742
01:21:35.091 --> 01:21:37.082
He's causing it.

743
01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:42.826
He's callin' it up, don't you see?

744
01:21:42.932 --> 01:21:47.596
Every time he's on watch,
that ship appears.

745
01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.702
You wait and see.

746
01:21:53.809 --> 01:21:58.803
Anytime tonight,
that ghost ship's gonna turn up.

747
01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:04.783
And it's gonna take us all with it,
straight down to the hot place.

748
01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:27.806
Mr Hollom.

749
01:22:27.877 --> 01:22:30.573
You gave me such a start.

750
01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:35.209
Are you feeling better now?

751
01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:38.844
Yes. Much better, thank you.

752
01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:54.533
The captain thinks we'll
get our wind tomorrow.

753
01:22:54.603 --> 01:22:56.696
I'm sure of it.

754
01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:29.195
You've always been very kind to me.

755
01:23:36.278 --> 01:23:38.712
Goodbye, Blakeney.

756
01:24:46.982 --> 01:24:51.783
The simple truth is, not all of us become
the men we once hoped we might be.

757
01:24:51.854 --> 01:24:54.823
But we are all God's creatures.

758
01:24:57.559 --> 01:25:01.893
If there are those among us
who thought ill of Mr Hollom,

759
01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.527
or spoke ill of him,

760
01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:10.865
or failed him in respect of fellowship,

761
01:25:12.141 --> 01:25:15.668
then we ask for your forgiveness, Lord.

762
01:25:15.744 --> 01:25:17.905
And we ask for his.

763
01:25:33.696 --> 01:25:36.256
God be praised. Mr Mowett?

764
01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:04.091
Avast there.

765
01:26:17.806 --> 01:26:20.934
- Doctor, have you seen the bird?
- What sort of bird?

766
01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:22.940
Some sort of albatross.

767
01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:28.042
Either that, or he's a prodigious great mew.
There it goes.

768
01:26:34.323 --> 01:26:38.259
There he is. My bird. Damn.

769
01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:41.896
It's circling, lads.

770
01:26:49.004 --> 01:26:50.062
Doctor?

771
01:26:50.139 --> 01:26:52.471
My God. Doctor.

772
01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:58.744
I'm so sorry, man.
The bird dropped low. I didn't see you.

773
01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:04.681
- Calamy, get Higgins.
- I'm fine, Jack.

774
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.998
The bullet took in a
piece of shirt with it.

775
01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:26.131
Unless it's removed,
it's gonna suppurate and fester.

776
01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:28.176
Are you equal to the task?

777
01:27:28.277 --> 01:27:34.341
I'll need to read up on the doctor's books.
Study some pictures he has.

778
01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:36.350
Study some pictures?

779
01:27:36.452 --> 01:27:39.512
It's just to get my bearings, that's all.

780
01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:46.220
It'd be a lot easier if I were on dry land.
You wouldn't have the…

781
01:27:46.328 --> 01:27:48.819
I'll manage. You'll see.

782
01:28:13.255 --> 01:28:16.986
Sail on the horizon, sir. Running west.

783
01:28:17.526 --> 01:28:20.393
We're not sure, but we think it's her, sir.

784
01:28:24.333 --> 01:28:26.324
Better get…

785
01:28:27.703 --> 01:28:29.762
Goodbye, sir.

786
01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:52.117
No mistakin' it. She's the Frenchie.

787
01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:02.864
Shall we beat to quarters, sir?

788
01:29:41.276 --> 01:29:43.767
Tell me this wasn't on my account.

789
01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:48.976
No, not at all.
I just needed to stretch my legs.

790
01:29:50.686 --> 01:29:53.120
Gently there.

791
01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:03.661
Briskly now. Secure this line.

792
01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:07.030
Royal Marines posted every 20 yards, sir.

793
01:30:18.113 --> 01:30:20.673
- All set, Higgins?
- Yes, sir.

794
01:30:20.782 --> 01:30:23.182
No.

795
01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:26.777
I do this with my own hand.

796
01:30:32.227 --> 01:30:35.321
If everything is under control,
I'll just be outside.

797
01:30:35.397 --> 01:30:38.491
A spare pair of steady hands
wouldn't go amiss.

798
01:30:38.567 --> 01:30:44.062
That is, if, of course, you have
the constitution for this kind of thing.

799
01:30:44.473 --> 01:30:52.380
My dear doctor, I have been amongst
and around wounds all my life.

800
01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:55.075
Good, then.

801
01:30:55.183 --> 01:31:00.246
Put your hand on my belly,
pressing firmly when I give the word.

802
01:31:00.355 --> 01:31:03.813
Higgins, the catling, if you please.

803
01:31:11.266 --> 01:31:13.530
Padeen, please.

804
01:31:26.782 --> 01:31:29.273
The sounder, Mr Higgins.

805
01:31:30.686 --> 01:31:32.745
Swab.

806
01:31:42.798 --> 01:31:44.891
All right.

807
01:31:47.803 --> 01:31:51.068
Mr Higgins, you'll have to raise the rib.

808
01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:58.107
Take a good grip with the square retractor.

809
01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:03.778
Right in.

810
01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:05.819
And lift up.

811
01:32:05.921 --> 01:32:07.388
Lift up.

812
01:32:20.469 --> 01:32:23.063
Swab, Jack. I can't see.

813
01:32:27.442 --> 01:32:30.468
Are you all right?

814
01:32:40.455 --> 01:32:42.514
I got it.

815
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:56.467
A tad more pressure.

816
01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:10.011
- Is that all of it?
- Aye, sir.

817
01:33:10.719 --> 01:33:12.949
She'll patch up nicely.

818
01:33:13.021 --> 01:33:14.955
Thank God I got it.

819
01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:02.566
That's good.

820
01:34:10.212 --> 01:34:12.009
Sir.

821
01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.914
- Padeen and I have been collecting for you.
- Have you really?

822
01:34:16.017 --> 01:34:19.612
The beetles each come with a specimen
of the plant they were found on.

823
01:34:19.721 --> 01:34:22.187
Padeen, that one's got away.

824
01:34:22.257 --> 01:34:26.523
Sir, I've made a few notes,
if you want to see them.

825
01:34:42.544 --> 01:34:46.571
Mr Blakeney, it would appear that
you have the makings of a naturalist.

826
01:34:46.648 --> 01:34:53.577
Perhaps I could combine them to be
a sort of fighting naturalist, like you, sir.

827
01:34:55.757 --> 01:34:59.090
They don't combine too well, I find.

828
01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:00.218
Right.

829
01:35:00.295 --> 01:35:02.661
Should you really be getting up, sir?

830
01:35:02.764 --> 01:35:06.222
- Mr Blakeney, are you also a doctor?
- No, sir.

831
01:35:06.301 --> 01:35:09.737
No, you're not. Padeen, if you please.

832
01:35:16.177 --> 01:35:20.614
How long does the captain
intend that we stay? Do you know?

833
01:35:22.484 --> 01:35:24.950
- Oh, a week perhaps.
- A week?

834
01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:29.081
- There's no great hurry.
- Mustn't we make haste for the Marquesas?

835
01:35:29.157 --> 01:35:32.090
I'm not even sure
it was the Acheron we sighted.

836
01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.188
And if it was, she'll be well away by now.
Like looking for an honest man in parliament.

837
01:35:37.299 --> 01:35:38.916
No, we shall head home.

838
01:35:38.987 --> 01:35:42.500
Before peace breaks out with
France, God forbid.

839
01:35:46.041 --> 01:35:49.474
I fear you may have burdened me
with a debt I can never repay.

840
01:35:49.544 --> 01:35:54.777
Tosh. Name a shrub after me.
Something prickly and hard to eradicate.

841
01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:59.513
A shrub? Nonsense.
I'll name a great tortoise after you.

842
01:35:59.621 --> 01:36:02.385
Testudo aubreii.

843
01:36:44.065 --> 01:36:47.398
Come on, pack up your things.
We should be going.

844
01:36:47.502 --> 01:36:50.699
- Back to camp, sir?
- No, to the other side of the island.

845
01:36:50.772 --> 01:36:55.232
- But, sir, that must be at least ten miles.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

846
01:36:55.343 --> 01:36:58.335
That's where I saw my flightless cormorant.

847
01:36:58.413 --> 01:37:00.347
Come on.

848
01:37:11.259 --> 01:37:14.228
Seven inches in length.

849
01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:17.255
Four inches wide.

850
01:37:17.365 --> 01:37:19.856
15-inches-long neck.

851
01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:25.269
Width at the widest point, six inches.

852
01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:34.873
Padeen, put the net down
and use your hands. They won't bite.

853
01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:37.213
Here's a good one.

854
01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:41.717
Pick them up carefully.

855
01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:45.223
Sir, I think we should be getting back.

856
01:37:45.293 --> 01:37:50.788
Naval discipline doesn't operate out here,
Mr Blakeney. I must find that cormorant.

857
01:37:50.899 --> 01:37:53.561
And should it indeed prove flightless,

858
01:37:53.635 --> 01:37:57.469
you can join me at the
Royal Society dinner as co-discoverer.

859
01:39:21.222 --> 01:39:22.746
Mr Blakeney.

860
01:39:37.906 --> 01:39:40.204
Sir, we must hurry.

861
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:44.287
Padeen, you must carry him.

862
01:39:44.358 --> 01:39:48.180
Put those down. Leave them.
Just put everything down.

863
01:39:51.619 --> 01:39:54.383
Open the cages.

864
01:40:08.803 --> 01:40:13.705
- All hands, unmoor ship.
- Mr Allen, I'll have her on a starboard tack.

865
01:40:13.775 --> 01:40:16.972
Let's have hands to stow these tortoises.

866
01:40:17.078 --> 01:40:21.139
Barret Bonden,
put your helm hard to starboard.

867
01:40:23.218 --> 01:40:26.619
He has a head start of two hours on us
and he's bearing south.

868
01:40:26.721 --> 01:40:30.418
That can only mean King Charles Island.
He's looking for water.

869
01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:37.659
If we caught up with her, to take her,
we'd have to be bloody invisible.

870
01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:41.835
Brace the yards to starboard.

871
01:40:51.112 --> 01:40:54.240
So, Stephen, did you get to see your bird?

872
01:40:54.315 --> 01:40:58.308
No. Well, yes, but I couldn't catch one.

873
01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:01.989
My greatest discovery was your phantom.

874
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:03.347
Indeed it was.

875
01:41:03.418 --> 01:41:07.118
I'm sorry you had to leave the
majority of your collection behind.

876
01:41:07.195 --> 01:41:13.191
In actual fact, Mr Blakeney and I
did make one very interesting find.

877
01:41:13.301 --> 01:41:15.963
Is that right?

878
01:41:16.037 --> 01:41:18.301
Let me guess. A stick?

879
01:41:25.446 --> 01:41:27.505
Tell him about it, Mr Blakeney.

880
01:41:27.615 --> 01:41:30.982
- It's a rare phasmid, sir.
- A phasmid?

881
01:41:31.052 --> 01:41:37.548
It's an insect that disguises itself
as a stick in order to confuse its predators.

882
01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:32.107
A nautical phasmid, Doctor.

883
01:42:32.213 --> 01:42:37.207
At least, to a hungry eye,
if one has an appetite for whalers.

884
01:42:37.285 --> 01:42:41.619
I intend to take a greater interest
in the bounty of nature from now on.

885
01:42:41.723 --> 01:42:46.251
I had no idea that a study of nature
could advance the art of naval warfare.

886
01:42:46.361 --> 01:42:48.352
I see.

887
01:42:48.429 --> 01:42:51.557
Now to pull this predator in close
and spring our trap.

888
01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:53.122
- Jack?
- Yes.

889
01:42:53.234 --> 01:42:56.067
You're the predator.

890
01:42:57.305 --> 01:43:02.402
There. Hull-down,
broad off the larboard bow.

891
01:43:02.477 --> 01:43:04.409
That's a frigate, all right.

892
01:43:04.479 --> 01:43:07.710
Damn, you've got good eyes, Barret.

893
01:43:07.782 --> 01:43:11.912
- Mr Allen. More smoke.
- Aye, sir.

894
01:43:11.986 --> 01:43:14.614
That'll bring 'em about.

895
01:43:25.466 --> 01:43:26.725
That's it, lads.

896
01:43:26.796 --> 01:43:30.337
Clean 'em up so they
fly straight and true.

897
01:43:32.807 --> 01:43:35.901
Let's have fresh flints in all the locks.

898
01:43:45.019 --> 01:43:49.854
Larboard battery,
unship your rear wheels.

899
01:43:54.362 --> 01:43:56.455
Drop the gun.

900
01:43:59.667 --> 01:44:03.296
- Come on, Killick, you too. Get dressed.
- Oh, God.

901
01:44:03.371 --> 01:44:06.304
- Tom?
- Our preparations are completed, sir.

902
01:44:06.374 --> 01:44:11.107
Good. Right, from now on no "sirs,"
no salutes, no whistles, no bells.

903
01:44:11.179 --> 01:44:12.840
Aye, sir.

904
01:44:12.947 --> 01:44:16.542
Yes, I think we're all
finding that quite difficult.

905
01:44:17.485 --> 01:44:20.477
There'll be 30 or more whalers
locked in the Acheron's hold.

906
01:44:20.555 --> 01:44:23.955
After we board, Mr Calamy
should take a party and free them.

907
01:44:24.025 --> 01:44:27.893
- You think him ready, sir?
- Were you ready, Tom?

908
01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:30.793
- He may well turn the tide.
- Indeed, sir.

909
01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:43.639
She's taken the bait. Let's come about.

910
01:44:43.711 --> 01:44:45.016
Make a show of fleeing,

911
01:44:45.087 --> 01:44:47.738
panicky and disorganized,
like a whaler might.

912
01:44:47.849 --> 01:44:50.249
Present company excepted, Mr Hogg.

913
01:44:50.351 --> 01:44:52.216
Hurry up, or they'll see you.

914
01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.796
Eckhart, leave that. That's fine.

915
01:44:53.867 --> 01:44:56.922
Just come up quick and get
some whaler's slops on.

916
01:45:09.737 --> 01:45:13.696
- Congratulations. Acting third lieutenant.
- Thank you.

917
01:45:13.774 --> 01:45:18.507
- I hear we're to free the whalers.
- You're to be stationed on the quarterdeck.

918
01:45:18.579 --> 01:45:21.013
I'm sorry, Will.

919
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:28.411
Make a bad show of keeping your course.
Let her run up and luff every now and then.

920
01:45:29.223 --> 01:45:32.190
- Excuse me, sir.
- Remove your hat. We're whalers.

921
01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:35.409
Mr Calamy says I'm not
on the boarding party.

922
01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.458
I want to say…

923
01:45:36.564 --> 01:45:40.625
I know what you want to say.
And my answer is no.

924
01:45:40.735 --> 01:45:43.302
You'll lead your gun crew,
then when we board,

925
01:45:43.373 --> 01:45:45.104
you'll take command of the ship.

926
01:45:45.206 --> 01:45:49.574
- Do I make myself clear?
- Take command of the ship? Thank you, sir.

927
01:45:49.644 --> 01:45:52.204
- Back to your station.
- Yes, sir.

928
01:45:55.383 --> 01:45:58.580
On your right upper arm,
to tell friend from foe.

929
01:45:58.653 --> 01:46:01.281
Davies, this arm. Starboard arm.

930
01:46:01.389 --> 01:46:05.120
- Is that the arm you got or don't got?
- Less of that cheek, Davies.

931
01:46:05.226 --> 01:46:08.992
Take your neck cloths
and put them round your right upper arm.

932
01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:11.656
Make way for the captain.

933
01:46:13.067 --> 01:46:15.126
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

934
01:46:15.236 --> 01:46:16.760
Right, lads.

935
01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:19.169
I know there's not a faint heart among you,

936
01:46:19.273 --> 01:46:23.073
and I know you're as anxious as I am
to get into close action.

937
01:46:23.144 --> 01:46:26.739
But we must bring him right up beside us
before we spring this trap.

938
01:46:26.814 --> 01:46:28.805
That will test our nerve.

939
01:46:28.916 --> 01:46:32.977
And discipline will count
just as much as courage.

940
01:46:33.087 --> 01:46:38.491
The Acheron is a tough nut to crack.
More than twice our guns and numbers.

941
01:46:38.593 --> 01:46:41.824
And they will sell their lives dearly.

942
01:46:43.664 --> 01:46:47.930
Topmen, your handling of the sheets
to be lubberly and un-navylike,

943
01:46:48.002 --> 01:46:50.664
until the signal
to spill the wind from our sails.

944
01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:54.172
This will bring us almost
to a complete stop.

945
01:46:54.275 --> 01:46:57.870
Gun crews, you must run out and tie down
in double-quick time.

946
01:46:57.979 --> 01:47:01.125
With the rear wheels removed
you've gained elevation,

947
01:47:01.196 --> 01:47:03.281
but without recoil you can't reload.

948
01:47:03.351 --> 01:47:08.653
So, gun captains, that gives you one shot
from the larboard battery. One shot only.

949
01:47:08.723 --> 01:47:13.524
You'll fire for her mainmast.
Much will depend on your accuracy.

950
01:47:13.628 --> 01:47:21.267
However, even crippled she will still
be dangerous, like a wounded beast.

951
01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:24.962
Captain Howard and the marines

952
01:47:25.039 --> 01:47:29.339
will sweep their weather deck with swivel
gun and musket fire from the tops.

953
01:47:29.410 --> 01:47:32.470
They'll try and even the odds for us
before we board.

954
01:47:34.248 --> 01:47:37.809
They mean to take us as a prize.

955
01:47:37.885 --> 01:47:44.586
And we are worth more to them undamaged.
Their greed will be their downfall.

956
01:47:46.427 --> 01:47:49.260
England is under threat of invasion.

957
01:47:49.363 --> 01:47:53.527
And though we be on the far side
of the world, this ship is our home.

958
01:47:55.169 --> 01:47:58.036
This ship is England.

959
01:48:01.175 --> 01:48:05.703
So it's every hand to his rope or gun.
Quick's the word and sharp's the action.

960
01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:09.216
After all, surprise is on our side.

961
01:48:20.695 --> 01:48:23.596
- Toss them high so they can see them.
- Hello, Doctor.

962
01:48:23.698 --> 01:48:25.062
Jack.

963
01:48:25.132 --> 01:48:27.396
- Care for a cigar?
- Thank you, no.

964
01:48:27.468 --> 01:48:30.062
If you please, Doctor.

965
01:48:31.472 --> 01:48:34.737
- I took the liberty, Doctor.
- Thank you, Killick.

966
01:48:34.809 --> 01:48:39.473
- There's three lumps in there.
- How kind.

967
01:49:34.268 --> 01:49:36.759
- Good luck, Will.
- Good luck, Peter.

968
01:49:38.539 --> 01:49:42.100
- See you afterwards.
- And you.

969
01:49:43.144 --> 01:49:46.773
Steady now, lads. Keep calm.

970
01:49:49.216 --> 01:49:52.811
English whaler Syren, this is Acheron.

971
01:49:52.887 --> 01:49:54.548
- Barret.
- Sir.

972
01:49:54.655 --> 01:49:59.456
You have no possibility, no chance.
But you have had warning.

973
01:49:59.527 --> 01:50:02.985
Stop now, or we will destroy your ship.

974
01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:06.497
English whaler, this is your last warning.

975
01:50:06.567 --> 01:50:10.867
Stop now, or we will destroy you.

976
01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:13.201
Let fly!

977
01:50:15.176 --> 01:50:18.976
Haul your yards there.

978
01:50:20.314 --> 01:50:22.475
Run out, boys.

979
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:23.710
Fire!

980
01:50:24.919 --> 01:50:26.716
Fire!

981
01:50:35.596 --> 01:50:38.258
For the mainmast, lads.

982
01:50:45.239 --> 01:50:47.707
- Let me through.
- Fire!

983
01:51:15.302 --> 01:51:17.395
Hard a-larboard.

984
01:51:18.105 --> 01:51:20.630
Right the headsails. Set the topsails.

985
01:51:20.741 --> 01:51:22.038
Heave.

986
01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:25.977
Man the starboard battery.

987
01:51:32.119 --> 01:51:34.485
Fire as she bears.

988
01:51:54.975 --> 01:51:57.942
Get to it.

989
01:51:58.012 --> 01:52:00.640
It's the fallen mast.
We can't lay alongside.

990
01:52:00.748 --> 01:52:03.774
Cross the wreckage as best you can.
I'll draw their fire.

991
01:52:03.851 --> 01:52:07.810
- My division to join Mr Pullings.
- Clew up topsails.

992
01:52:07.922 --> 01:52:10.914
Huzzah for Lucky Jack.

993
01:52:10.991 --> 01:52:13.619
Grappling hooks away.

994
01:52:13.694 --> 01:52:16.128
Run out the boarding planks.

995
01:52:18.265 --> 01:52:23.430
- My division, follow me.
- For England, for home, and for the prize.

996
01:52:24.038 --> 01:52:26.632
Here we go, lads.

997
01:52:30.811 --> 01:52:32.870
Pipe down. Silence.

998
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:57.660
Looks like the job is done, sir.

999
01:52:57.738 --> 01:52:59.501
Acheron.

1000
01:53:13.821 --> 01:53:15.015
Fire!

1001
01:53:31.739 --> 01:53:34.105
Mr Blakeney, the nine-pounder.

1002
01:53:34.208 --> 01:53:36.073
That's it.

1003
01:53:36.176 --> 01:53:37.234
Fire!

1004
01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:40.843
Keep moving, men. Keep moving.

1005
01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:31.828
Joe.

1006
01:54:37.738 --> 01:54:39.330
Grenades, ready.

1007
01:54:49.516 --> 01:54:52.485
They're aiming for our hull.

1008
01:54:52.586 --> 01:54:55.248
They could sink us. Depress the muzzle.

1009
01:54:55.322 --> 01:54:57.347
Padeen, train it aft.

1010
01:54:57.458 --> 01:54:59.119
Together now.

1011
01:55:00.027 --> 01:55:02.188
Stand clear.

1012
01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:04.025
Fire!

1013
01:55:04.932 --> 01:55:07.332
Arm yourselves. We must board them.

1014
01:55:08.702 --> 01:55:10.795
Follow me.

1015
01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:27.983
Now.

1016
01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:36.789
Whalers, follow me.
Mr Hogg, down below. Quickly now.

1017
01:55:39.233 --> 01:55:43.033
Albatrosses. Albatrosses, do you hear me?

1018
01:55:44.004 --> 01:55:46.029
To the guns.

1019
01:55:49.643 --> 01:55:51.975
Boyle, douse that gun's priming.

1020
01:56:27.181 --> 01:56:30.173
Lively there. Come on. Move.

1021
01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:36.382
Now do your worst.

1022
01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:09.720
- Mr Howard.
- Sir.

1023
01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:12.418
- Have they struck their colors?
- I believe so.

1024
01:57:12.492 --> 01:57:16.155
- Has their captain been sighted?
- Not yet, sir.

1025
01:57:16.263 --> 01:57:18.254
- Carry on.
- Aye, sir.

1026
01:58:20.127 --> 01:58:22.527
Docteur de Vigny, monsieur.

1027
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:25.393
I did what I could for him.

1028
01:58:30.504 --> 01:58:34.634
Before the capitaine died,
he said I was to give you this.

1029
02:00:04.631 --> 02:00:07.600
No. I'll do it.

1030
02:00:21.314 --> 02:00:23.748
Can you help me?

1031
02:00:47.607 --> 02:00:49.438
Our Father,

1032
02:00:49.509 --> 02:00:53.536
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1033
02:00:53.647 --> 02:00:57.515
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

1034
02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.983
on earth as it is in heaven.

1035
02:01:00.654 --> 02:01:03.384
Give us this day our daily bread,

1036
02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:08.393
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

1037
02:01:08.495 --> 02:01:12.556
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1038
02:01:12.666 --> 02:01:14.631
For thine is the kingdom,

1039
02:01:14.701 --> 02:01:16.726
the power and the glory,

1040
02:01:16.837 --> 02:01:18.896
forever and ever.

1041
02:01:19.005 --> 02:01:20.529
Amen.

1042
02:01:21.174 --> 02:01:24.632
Robert Gardner, able seaman.

1043
02:01:24.711 --> 02:01:28.545
James Lloyd, boatswain's mate.

1044
02:01:28.648 --> 02:01:31.674
Robert Kemp, able seaman.

1045
02:01:32.886 --> 02:01:36.822
John Antonio, quartermaster's mate.

1046
02:01:38.058 --> 02:01:42.017
Michael Doudle, able seaman.

1047
02:01:43.530 --> 02:01:47.193
Joseph Nagle, carpenter's mate.

1048
02:01:48.835 --> 02:01:52.066
John Allen, sailing master.

1049
02:01:57.577 --> 02:01:59.568
Peter Miles Calamy,

1050
02:02:04.284 --> 02:02:06.548
lieutenant.

1051
02:02:08.955 --> 02:02:12.220
We therefore commit
their bodies to the deep,

1052
02:02:12.292 --> 02:02:14.453
to be turned into corruption,

1053
02:02:14.561 --> 02:02:18.395
looking for the resurrection of the body
when the sea shall give up her dead,

1054
02:02:18.465 --> 02:02:21.364
and the life of the world to come,

1055
02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:24.767
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1056
02:02:24.871 --> 02:02:26.930
Amen.

1057
02:02:55.802 --> 02:02:58.100
It's our old friend.

1058
02:03:52.492 --> 02:03:55.484
Pass down a barrel of paint, please.

1059
02:04:02.002 --> 02:04:06.166
Sir, the whalers are all aboard
and that's the last detachment of marines.

1060
02:04:06.239 --> 02:04:07.866
Good.

1061
02:04:07.974 --> 02:04:10.738
I think I shall return to the Galapagos.

1062
02:04:10.844 --> 02:04:14.575
Take on food and water and give
the doctor a few days to find his bird.

1063
02:04:14.681 --> 02:04:15.875
Very good, sir.

1064
02:04:15.982 --> 02:04:19.418
You, however, shall take
the Acheron south to Valparaiso.

1065
02:04:19.519 --> 02:04:21.132
Parole the prisoners there,

1066
02:04:21.203 --> 02:04:24.718
refit as necessary,
and we shall rendezvous in Portsmouth.

1067
02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:27.850
I believe Mr Hogg would be
a good choice for sailing master.

1068
02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:32.694
However, that will be your decision,
Captain Pullings.

1069
02:04:37.604 --> 02:04:39.697
Your orders.

1070
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:46.240
- Thank you, sir.
- Godspeed, Tom.

1071
02:04:46.346 --> 02:04:48.337
And to you, sir.

1072
02:04:54.087 --> 02:04:56.052
- Mr Mowett?
- With pleasure, sir.

1073
02:04:56.122 --> 02:04:58.784
- Good luck.
- See you in Portsmouth.

1074
02:04:58.892 --> 02:05:02.384
Now, lads, huzzah for Captain Pullings.

1075
02:05:10.036 --> 02:05:13.767
- Good luck, sir.
- Good luck, Captain.

1076
02:05:29.789 --> 02:05:31.721
Here we go again.

1077
02:05:31.791 --> 02:05:34.257
Killick. Killick there.

1078
02:05:34.327 --> 02:05:37.125
Which it will be ready when it's ready.

1079
02:05:42.669 --> 02:05:45.602
I'll rest easier when I know
they've reached shore.

1080
02:05:45.672 --> 02:05:50.974
So many wounded, and only that poor
unfortunate Higgins to tend to them.

1081
02:05:51.077 --> 02:05:54.740
Still, he's better than no doctor at all.

1082
02:05:54.814 --> 02:05:59.615
- I met their doctor. I spoke to him.
- No, he died of fever months ago.

1083
02:05:59.686 --> 02:06:02.280
De Vigny?

1084
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:17.600
- Pass the word for Mr Mowett.
- Mr Mowett to the great cabin.

1085
02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:20.696
Their "doctor" gave me this sword.

1086
02:06:21.674 --> 02:06:22.868
Sir.

1087
02:06:22.976 --> 02:06:26.002
Mr Mowett, change of course.
Southeast by east.

1088
02:06:26.112 --> 02:06:29.604
We'll intercept the Acheron
and escort them into Valparaiso.

1089
02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:32.549
Aye, sir. Sou'east by east.

1090
02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:36.350
- And William.
- Sir?

1091
02:06:36.456 --> 02:06:39.186
- Beat to quarters.
- Very good, sir.

1092
02:06:44.230 --> 02:06:47.688
Subject to the requirements of the service.

1093
02:06:55.141 --> 02:06:58.474
Well, Stephen, the bird's flightless?

1094
02:06:58.545 --> 02:06:59.637
Yes.

1095
02:07:00.713 --> 02:07:03.375
It's not going anywhere.
