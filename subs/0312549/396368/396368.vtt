1
00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:31.564
Father, look kindly on your children
who put their trust in you.

2
00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:35.193
Bless them and keep them from all harm.

3
00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:38.780
Strengthen them against
the attacks of the devil.

4
00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:44.077
May they never offend you,
but seek to love you in all they do.

5
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:50.083
May Almighty God bless you,
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

6
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.962
The Mass has ended.
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

7
00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:56.965
Thanks be to God.

8
00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:07.433
Good morning, Mary. How are you?

9
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.396
Good morning, Elizabeth. How are you?

10
00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.356
Good morning, Bernie.

11
00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.818
Father, would you say a prayer
to Our Lady for an intervention?

12
00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:19.028
- What's wrong? Is someone sick?
- No.

13
00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:22.907
I just want us to pray for my daughter
to lose her driving licence.

14
00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:27.912
Case number 37422: Veronica Guerin.

15
00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.750
Almost 1200 parking tickets.

16
00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:37.130
March 10th, speeding ticket.

17
00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:39.591
108 miles per hour.

18
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.388
Just last month another speeding ticket
for driving at 104 miles per hour.

19
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:50.101
Well, now, I think that shows
some improvement by my client, Judge.

20
00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:53.813
I'll alert mothers it's safe
to let their children back on the streets.

21
00:01:53.897 --> 00:02:00.069
I... I deserve to lose this case, Judge.
That's fair enough, you know.

22
00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:05.658
But if I can't drive, I can't do my job. I'm
a journalist with the Sunday Independent.

23
00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:11.539
We all know who you are, Miss Guerin.
That does not grant you immunity.

24
00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:32.352
This is Bernie Guerin. I can't take your call
at the moment. Please leave a message.

25
00:02:32.977 --> 00:02:36.814
Mum, I'm driving!
Can you believe it? He let me off.

26
00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:40.318
He actually let me off.
I love you, Mum. Talk to you.

27
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:43.696
Ah, no! You're having me on.

28
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.492
No, I swear to God. Just a £100 fine
and a warning. I'm behind the wheel again.

29
00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:50.537
- It's your ma, the criminal.
- Hi, Ma.

30
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.582
Well, I hope you've learned a lesson
and reformed your ways, young lady.

31
00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:58.795
- Hey, you're not speeding now, are you?
- No, of course I'm not.

32
00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:00.964
Well, maybe a little.

33
00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:04.676
What did you say to that daft judge?

34
00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.095
I told him I was guilty as sin.

35
00:03:07.178 --> 00:03:11.099
And he let you off?
Pleads a great case for judicial reform.

36
00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:15.103
Yeah. Another repeat offender
returned to decent society.

37
00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:20.066
This is Garda detective Chris Mulligan.
Please leave a message.

38
00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.488
You didn't get me this time, Chris.
Still got the wheels.

39
00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:29.576
I was fined - you're gonna love this -
100 quid. Can you believe it?

40
00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.872
You owe me lunch. You said wherever
I want, and I'm expensive, don't forget.

41
00:03:40.712 --> 00:03:42.380
Veronica?

42
00:03:43.298 --> 00:03:44.632
Veronica?

43
00:05:19.644 --> 00:05:22.230
The fucking eagle has landed.

44
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.883
How are you, boss?

45
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:47.899
Push off, you little scum.

46
00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:53.196
Come on, get your money ready. £5.

47
00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.772
How are you?

48
00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:15.820
The name's Veronica.
I write for the Sunday Independent.

49
00:08:19.407 --> 00:08:22.243
May I ask you some questions?
D'you mind?

50
00:08:24.662 --> 00:08:27.665
How much d'you pay for one of those?

51
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:33.421
A few quid. Anyway, it's cheaper
to rent someone else's needle.

52
00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:35.506
What about the score?

53
00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.427
- First one's free.
- Well, I heard £5.

54
00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:48.561
- Where d'you get the cash for all this?
- I just say to some broad like you:

55
00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:53.399
"Give me your money
or I'll inject you with AIDS. "

56
00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:58.947
- How old are you?
- What's it to you?

57
00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:03.326
I'm writing a piece for the paper.
I wanna know where you get the gear.

58
00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:08.957
I'll do your work for you.
Come back when you got some money.

59
00:09:14.837 --> 00:09:20.134
- Fatso, don't be spending that on food.
- I'll check it later.

60
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.888
- Lost, are we?
- Who might you be?

61
00:09:23.972 --> 00:09:27.850
- Neighbourhood watch.
- Yeah, well, better keep an eye out.

62
00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:31.479
I hear there's some dodgy scangers about.

63
00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:40.613
I fucking swear to God...

64
00:10:04.596 --> 00:10:07.599
Ah, Jamey, Jamey, Jamey, Jamey.

65
00:10:08.516 --> 00:10:10.727
You're an awful man, do you know that?

66
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.189
What'd you have to go and shoot
your mouth off to the Gards about me for?

67
00:10:15.273 --> 00:10:19.027
Did you think I wouldn't find out it was you?

68
00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:23.781
You know, I was thinking about killing you.

69
00:10:24.657 --> 00:10:30.246
And then I thought to myself,
people get killed every day,

70
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.707
and nobody gives a shite.

71
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.377
So I've decided
I'm going to have to hurt you a bit.

72
00:10:37.587 --> 00:10:41.049
Actually, I'm going to hurt you an awful lot.

73
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.387
But the good news is that I'm going to
do you meself. Oh, yeah. Personally.

74
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:48.973
I mean, you don't want people thinking,

75
00:10:49.057 --> 00:10:52.810
just because I got me name
in the papers and all that,

76
00:10:52.894 --> 00:10:59.317
that Martin Cahill is too posh to do
his own dirty work, now, do you, huh?

77
00:11:07.158 --> 00:11:09.327
For fuck's sake...

78
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.163
Take the gag out of his mouth.

79
00:11:12.247 --> 00:11:18.002
Let the little scumbag squeal.
It's what he's good at, isn't it? Squeal!

80
00:11:41.442 --> 00:11:43.528
Please...

81
00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:10.263
- I'm sorry!
- How are you?

82
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.893
- You made lunch. Aren't you great?
- I must be.

83
00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:18.938
- Hi.
- Hi, Jimmy.

84
00:12:19.022 --> 00:12:22.150
Off to a big news story, are we?

85
00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:26.112
Come on, Ronnie. Give us a scoop.
Who's the scumbag of the week?

86
00:12:26.196 --> 00:12:30.074
Go and buy the paper, little brother.
You ready for me?

87
00:12:30.158 --> 00:12:34.329
- Did I say something?
- Don't look at me. She's your sister.

88
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.173
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

89
00:12:45.256 --> 00:12:49.302
Night. Night, darling.
I'm in the other room if you need me.

90
00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:51.721
OK.

91
00:12:55.099 --> 00:12:57.393
He won't have any trouble sleeping tonight.

92
00:12:57.477 --> 00:13:00.188
That's cos you wore him out
on the football pitch.

93
00:13:00.271 --> 00:13:02.357
Yeah.

94
00:13:04.192 --> 00:13:06.277
- What's up?
- Nothing.

95
00:13:08.112 --> 00:13:10.657
Nothing or something?

96
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.201
It's bollocks, what I'm writing.

97
00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:17.705
- Give yourself a bit of credit for a change.
- Whatever. So it's half-decent bollocks.

98
00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:20.750
It's light. It's human interest.

99
00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:22.919
It's bollocks.

100
00:13:23.795 --> 00:13:27.298
What a state, on the street.
There were needles everywhere.

101
00:13:27.382 --> 00:13:30.343
- Right where the kids were playing.
- Jesus.

102
00:13:30.426 --> 00:13:36.057
You should have seen these wankers.
Standing there with their new Mercedes.

103
00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.978
How many £5 hits of dope do you need
to shift in order to buy a new Mercedes?

104
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:43.398
Do the math. How many kids is that?

105
00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:50.530
Nobody's writing about it. Nobody cares.

106
00:13:50.613 --> 00:13:53.616
Somebody needs
to get after these bastards.

107
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:59.414
They're making megabucks.
That's what I should be writing about.

108
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:04.252
That wouldn't be bollocks.

109
00:14:07.255 --> 00:14:10.341
The pushers are using the underage kids
to do their business.

110
00:14:10.425 --> 00:14:14.554
They know the Gards won't touch the kids.
Everyone knows what goes on here.

111
00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:18.850
Eight kids from this block alone
died from drugs last year. Eight.

112
00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:22.061
All of them under 15.
Four of them were me sister Iris's kids.

113
00:14:22.145 --> 00:14:23.521
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

114
00:14:23.605 --> 00:14:26.691
TDs, Gards, close their eyes,
call it a family problem.

115
00:14:26.774 --> 00:14:29.277
But for some families
these kids are dead already.

116
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.990
So we formed Concerned Parents
Against Drugs, made it our problem.

117
00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:36.242
I'd appreciate it if you'd write about us.

118
00:14:36.326 --> 00:14:38.161
- How often do you march?
- Once a week.

119
00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:41.206
- It's quite a commitment.
- It's quite a problem.

120
00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:44.209
Hey. Do you remember me?

121
00:14:47.462 --> 00:14:51.633
- Were those Cahill's lads in the van?
- What van?

122
00:14:52.508 --> 00:14:55.053
She can help, Timmy.

123
00:14:55.136 --> 00:14:58.181
You know, Martin Cahill. The General.

124
00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:00.475
You know him?

125
00:15:01.351 --> 00:15:03.853
What's your cut?

126
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:11.402
- I'd better go. I can't be seen with yous.
- Let us help you, Timmy.

127
00:15:11.486 --> 00:15:14.864
I can find you a good place
to stay tonight. Tomorrow...

128
00:15:14.948 --> 00:15:17.325
Do yous wanna have sex with me?

129
00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:20.787
I'm not expensive.

130
00:15:26.918 --> 00:15:30.046
- The bill, please.
- He nicked your wallet.

131
00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:32.674
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

132
00:15:32.757 --> 00:15:34.509
- When do we want them?
- Now!

133
00:15:34.592 --> 00:15:36.261
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

134
00:15:36.344 --> 00:15:39.138
- When do you want them?
- Now!

135
00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:41.558
Are these marches always this small?

136
00:15:41.641 --> 00:15:44.561
Hopefully, with your help,
the word'll get out to more people.

137
00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:46.896
Yeah, hopefully.

138
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.649
I'll make sure it does.

139
00:15:53.653 --> 00:15:58.491
- Get out, Mullen!
- You bastard, Tommy Mullen!

140
00:16:02.537 --> 00:16:04.247
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

141
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.707
- When do we want them?
- Now!

142
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.500
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

143
00:16:07.584 --> 00:16:09.127
- When do we want them?
- Now!

144
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.005
- Pusher, pusher, pusher!
- Out, out, out!

145
00:16:26.102 --> 00:16:29.647
Look who's got hisself a new girlfriend.

146
00:16:32.567 --> 00:16:37.405
- We'll see you there, then, John.
- Yeah, go on ahead.

147
00:16:37.488 --> 00:16:41.993
- What the hell do you want?
- Is that any way to talk to a lady?

148
00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:44.662
Ladies don't go calling
on gentleman unannounced.

149
00:16:44.746 --> 00:16:46.831
So we're a gentleman now, are we?

150
00:16:46.915 --> 00:16:50.418
Where's your manners?
You didn't introduce me to your friends.

151
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:53.588
- If that's what you're after.
- You closing up early?

152
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:56.341
One of the benefits of being self-employed.

153
00:16:56.424 --> 00:17:02.096
You're amazing, John.
No, really, you're a model of... profitability.

154
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.309
How to succeed in business
without any customers.

155
00:17:06.392 --> 00:17:08.311
- I do well enough.
- Yeah, well...

156
00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:11.898
There must be a few bob
in those brothels there on Rathgar Road.

157
00:17:11.981 --> 00:17:14.651
What they worth now, John?

158
00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:19.447
- You're a dangerous little bitch.
- Ah, well. Do my best. Buy us a drink?

159
00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:25.203
It's the benefit of being self-employed,
John. You are your own boss, aren't you?

160
00:17:25.286 --> 00:17:29.749
You're way off the mark. Martin Cahill
isn't into the drugs. Neither am I.

161
00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:31.751
You sure?

162
00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:35.505
We're just ordinary, decent criminals.

163
00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:38.967
If you're not going to take my word for it,
why don't you ask Martin?

164
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:44.681
- He's very fond of the ladies.
- Yeah, exactly. So set it up for me.

165
00:17:45.473 --> 00:17:48.393
Why are you chasing the drugs?
You should be after the pubs.

166
00:17:48.476 --> 00:17:52.021
- They do more damage than the drugs.
- Yeah, right.

167
00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:53.356
Yeah?

168
00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:56.818
No. I tried that. It was a dead end.

169
00:17:56.901 --> 00:17:58.653
Call you back? Grand.

170
00:17:59.571 --> 00:18:02.490
So how many guys
are you working for stories at once?

171
00:18:03.575 --> 00:18:06.494
A less generous person
might say you were ungrateful

172
00:18:06.578 --> 00:18:08.913
for what I gave you already.

173
00:18:08.997 --> 00:18:13.543
Stealing old paintings, kidnapping bankers'
families. You're above that now, are you?

174
00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:16.421
I got you famous with those stories.

175
00:18:16.504 --> 00:18:19.966
Yeah, you feed me superficial crap.

176
00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:23.428
- I make you look good.
- Great picture.

177
00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:28.391
Come on. I need your help to get to Cahill.
Write me a reference.

178
00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:30.977
I'm late for an appointment.

179
00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:35.857
Word of advice.
Stay away from Martin Cahill.

180
00:18:45.033 --> 00:18:47.160
Sorry to disturb you.

181
00:18:47.243 --> 00:18:51.873
Are you Mrs Cahill? Frances Cahill?

182
00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:57.670
Right.

183
00:19:12.018 --> 00:19:14.562
Are you Frances Cahill?

184
00:19:14.646 --> 00:19:17.232
- I am.
- Hi. I'm Veronica.

185
00:19:17.315 --> 00:19:21.361
- I'm a friend of John Traynor's.
- I know who you are.

186
00:19:21.444 --> 00:19:25.156
Is your husband home?
I just want to ask him a favour.

187
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.327
Martin Cahill doesn't
do favours for journalists.

188
00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.079
So piss off.

189
00:19:31.162 --> 00:19:35.291
There's a rumour going about he's putting
drugs on the street. You got any comment?

190
00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:39.754
I know he nailed a tout to the floor of a flat
the other day. Was it drug-related?

191
00:19:39.837 --> 00:19:43.591
Look, I just want a brief comment.
Off the record.

192
00:19:43.675 --> 00:19:45.552
I'll be out of your...

193
00:19:45.635 --> 00:19:48.555
Mr Cahill! You couldn't
do me a favour, could you?

194
00:19:48.638 --> 00:19:52.517
I need the names of those kids
who are selling drugs for you.

195
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.438
And I'll do you a favour. I won't write
what people are saying about you.

196
00:19:57.522 --> 00:20:01.359
You know, that you're having kids
with your wife's sisters.

197
00:20:01.442 --> 00:20:04.362
There's me number. Give me a call.

198
00:20:05.196 --> 00:20:07.282
Cheers.

199
00:20:15.957 --> 00:20:18.167
So, what can I do for you, Veronica?

200
00:20:18.251 --> 00:20:20.461
How could you lose a body?

201
00:20:21.504 --> 00:20:25.300
- That's just downright careless.
- You find some, you lose some.

202
00:20:25.383 --> 00:20:27.677
It'll turn up. Those bodies always do.

203
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.846
So you gonna join those crying foul?

204
00:20:29.929 --> 00:20:33.099
"More Garda incompetence.
Is this why we pay our taxes?"

205
00:20:33.182 --> 00:20:38.354
Some might say it's incompetent, but
you could say it's that you're understaffed.

206
00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:44.611
Your hands are tied. You couldn't maintain
24-hour surveillance on that murder site.

207
00:20:44.694 --> 00:20:49.532
People should know that.
I mean, I think someone should write that.

208
00:20:49.616 --> 00:20:53.703
And if someone did write that,
what would that someone want in return?

209
00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:58.708
I talked to the couple you detained
after the weekend in Amsterdam.

210
00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:04.130
Held for 48 hours cos they bought
nothing there but a box of condoms.

211
00:21:04.214 --> 00:21:09.552
How does it feel to wait around for a mule
to shite out a condom full of drugs?

212
00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:14.140
You and I both know that the courier's
the lowest man in the organisation.

213
00:21:14.224 --> 00:21:18.603
Somewhere some Mr Big is sitting there,
laughing at you and your stool sample.

214
00:21:18.686 --> 00:21:22.649
You can't touch him. I want -
we both want - to get Mr Untouchable.

215
00:21:22.732 --> 00:21:24.817
What are you gonna do when you get him?

216
00:21:24.901 --> 00:21:28.530
Your paper's so scared
that some big criminal is gonna sue them,

217
00:21:28.613 --> 00:21:30.949
they employ more lawyers than journalists.

218
00:21:31.032 --> 00:21:35.203
Well, I mean,
there's more than 300,000 people.

219
00:21:35.286 --> 00:21:39.249
I don't want to blow my own trumpet,
but they know Martin Cahill's the General

220
00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:42.544
because, you know,
of what I write in the Sunday Independent.

221
00:21:42.627 --> 00:21:46.923
- At least they know what he's up to.
- Great, for your readers.

222
00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:49.425
But does it help me
put him behind bars, does it?

223
00:21:49.509 --> 00:21:52.595
We're on the same side, Chris.

224
00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:55.807
Now, I trained as an accountant, right?

225
00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.895
If I could have a look at these files,
then I could go after those other wankers.

226
00:22:00.979 --> 00:22:03.356
Put some pressure on them.

227
00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:05.525
Come on.

228
00:22:06.526 --> 00:22:08.236
Go on.

229
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:18.037
Look, I've got some more packing to do.
I'll be back in an hour or so.

230
00:22:18.121 --> 00:22:21.708
Looking forward to reading
someone's column on Sunday.

231
00:22:30.675 --> 00:22:33.803
"For the Coach every day is lotto day. "

232
00:22:35.597 --> 00:22:40.268
"What others might earn in a decade,
he can conjure up in an afternoon. "

233
00:22:40.351 --> 00:22:45.231
"His Swiss scam was such a stroke,
a child of his remarkable ingenuity. "

234
00:22:45.315 --> 00:22:47.942
"The fruits of a complex fraud... "

235
00:22:48.026 --> 00:22:50.195
- The Coach, boss.
- What?

236
00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:57.076
Never knew you were
such a horse lover, John.

237
00:23:01.122 --> 00:23:04.042
- What took you so long?
- The traffic.

238
00:23:04.125 --> 00:23:07.754
Nothing to do with that woman
who writes for the Sunday Indo?

239
00:23:07.837 --> 00:23:11.132
- Did the boys say something?
- That's not the question, Johnny.

240
00:23:11.216 --> 00:23:13.676
The question is:
what did you say to that woman?

241
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.845
Nothing important.

242
00:23:17.263 --> 00:23:19.599
She fancies me, so I humour her.

243
00:23:19.682 --> 00:23:24.229
You know why I'm successful, Johnny?
I lead a quiet life.

244
00:23:24.312 --> 00:23:28.525
Nobody knows what I'm doing,
and that's very good for business.

245
00:23:28.608 --> 00:23:34.364
When you talk to that bitch and when she
writes about you, you feel like a movie star.

246
00:23:34.447 --> 00:23:39.244
Don't think she doesn't know
how to use that, because she does.

247
00:23:39.327 --> 00:23:44.457
You're not as smart as you think you are.
That makes you a liability.

248
00:23:44.541 --> 00:23:51.923
Remember this. If that bitch
ever mentions my name, you pay.

249
00:23:58.221 --> 00:24:00.557
You like playing the gangster, do you?

250
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.645
Do you? It makes you feel like a big man.
Does it make you feel like a big man?

251
00:24:05.728 --> 00:24:10.775
How does it feel now?
Heap of shite! You heap of shite!

252
00:24:10.859 --> 00:24:13.319
- John, please...
- You bunch of eejits.

253
00:24:13.403 --> 00:24:18.783
Who's the fucking genius
messing with the gun around my horses?

254
00:24:18.867 --> 00:24:23.538
You don't insult me boys, Gerry.
You leave that to me.

255
00:24:23.621 --> 00:24:27.250
Unless you want
some of the same yourself.

256
00:24:31.462 --> 00:24:35.425
Word of advice.
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

257
00:24:37.051 --> 00:24:39.470
I called you here
cos we've got a debt to settle.

258
00:24:39.554 --> 00:24:40.805
What debt?

259
00:24:40.889 --> 00:24:45.101
Your man Martin Cahill thinks
over half a million quid is owed him.

260
00:24:45.184 --> 00:24:49.063
I got him to loan us that money to start up
the operation. If he wants it back...

261
00:24:49.147 --> 00:24:52.233
As far as I'm concerned
that money keeps moving forward.

262
00:24:52.317 --> 00:24:57.614
He lent you the money when you were just
out of prison. Now he's down on his luck.

263
00:24:57.697 --> 00:25:00.992
He can't shift the paintings
from the last job. They're too hot.

264
00:25:01.075 --> 00:25:03.786
- Why don't you just pay him?
- No, no. You don't get it.

265
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.041
When a scumbag like Cahill is down
on his luck, you kick him in the bollocks.

266
00:25:08.124 --> 00:25:11.628
Wouldn't try that with Martin Cahill.

267
00:25:11.711 --> 00:25:14.505
Whose side are you on, Coach?

268
00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:19.052
I just think we should make payment.

269
00:25:19.135 --> 00:25:23.598
Don't you worry about it.
We're gonna make payment.

270
00:26:14.566 --> 00:26:16.234
Jesus!

271
00:26:43.428 --> 00:26:45.680
Are you people fucking insane?

272
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.767
For a few hundred grand,
you've murdered all of us.

273
00:26:49.851 --> 00:26:51.728
I don't like your tone, Coach.

274
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:53.897
Maybe the Gards
don't know what you did

275
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.191
but if the rest of the Cahill mob find out,

276
00:26:56.274 --> 00:27:00.904
they'll kill yous
and everyone you did business with.

277
00:27:00.987 --> 00:27:05.241
The IRA has claimed responsibility
for the murder of Martin Cahill.

278
00:27:05.325 --> 00:27:10.705
We are now doing everything in our power
to apprehend and identify the gunmen.

279
00:27:10.788 --> 00:27:12.874
At the moment,
no progress has been made.

280
00:27:12.957 --> 00:27:15.627
This isn't the first execution
we've seen all year.

281
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.004
What progress has been
made on other cases?

282
00:27:18.087 --> 00:27:20.965
I cannot comment
on any other investigation at this time.

283
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:24.135
Why is progress never made
on any cases involving the IRA?

284
00:27:24.219 --> 00:27:30.016
Cahill's family has stated that the General -
and I quote - "was not killed by the IRA,

285
00:27:30.099 --> 00:27:33.853
but because someone saw how much
money he made and wanted to take over. "

286
00:27:33.937 --> 00:27:37.315
In your opinion,
could the murder be drug-related?

287
00:27:37.398 --> 00:27:41.945
- You can't believe everything you hear.
- Neither can you, Des.

288
00:27:51.371 --> 00:27:56.584
Look, Veronica, every journalist
sees a vast conspiracy in everything.

289
00:27:56.668 --> 00:28:00.880
We haven't a fucking clue about anything.
We just don't know who killed Cahill.

290
00:28:00.964 --> 00:28:06.219
Yeah, and you don't care, right? As long as
they kill each other, it's easier for all of you.

291
00:28:07.887 --> 00:28:12.141
Here. Let's sort out the petty criminals first.

292
00:28:12.892 --> 00:28:19.148
Those who loved Martin Cahill
feel a deep sense of loss and pain.

293
00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.570
Violence can only lead to death,

294
00:28:25.113 --> 00:28:29.742
because it's the way of hatred,
fear and revenge.

295
00:28:30.618 --> 00:28:34.205
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name, thy kingdom come...

296
00:28:34.289 --> 00:28:38.251
Nothing like a funeral
to bring out the competition, is there?

297
00:28:38.334 --> 00:28:43.214
Look at Gerry Hutch there, all tearful.
Or should I say the Monk?

298
00:28:43.298 --> 00:28:46.384
He's not bad-looking, for a monk.

299
00:28:46.467 --> 00:28:49.262
The thing about monks,
though, is they're celibate.

300
00:28:49.345 --> 00:28:51.431
Supposedly.

301
00:28:53.474 --> 00:28:56.144
See those two there?
They're dealers, right?

302
00:28:56.227 --> 00:28:59.981
Oh, yeah.
Fatso Mitchell and Tommy Mullen.

303
00:29:03.735 --> 00:29:06.905
- Cahill wasn't running drugs.
- No?

304
00:29:06.988 --> 00:29:12.702
I followed the money and it turns out
your man was absolutely broke.

305
00:29:12.785 --> 00:29:15.538
- The family had to borrow 10,000 for this.
- Really?

306
00:29:15.622 --> 00:29:18.791
- Didn't have the cash to run drugs.
- For fuck's sakes.

307
00:29:18.875 --> 00:29:22.921
Will you look? The north side rivals
to pay their respects.

308
00:29:24.422 --> 00:29:27.008
That's Brian Meehan there.

309
00:29:27.091 --> 00:29:30.887
- The blond one?
- Yeah. Nasty little fucker.

310
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.558
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

311
00:29:35.642 --> 00:29:39.062
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.

312
00:29:39.145 --> 00:29:41.481
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

313
00:29:41.564 --> 00:29:48.321
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

314
00:29:53.701 --> 00:29:54.744
Yeah?

315
00:29:54.827 --> 00:30:00.667
- The IRA didn't act alone.
- Tell me something I don't know.

316
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:05.547
- Where are you?
- Gerry Hutch ordered the hit on Cahill.

317
00:30:06.422 --> 00:30:09.926
Hutch? Jesus, are you sure, now?

318
00:30:10.677 --> 00:30:12.637
I was there.

319
00:30:24.899 --> 00:30:26.985
She bought it.

320
00:30:28.695 --> 00:30:30.780
Boohoo!

321
00:30:32.824 --> 00:30:34.534
Boohoo!

322
00:30:38.872 --> 00:30:42.166
Get out of here now
or I'll put you out of your misery.

323
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.544
OK. Let's bring him in.

324
00:30:53.469 --> 00:30:56.931
Right, strip him and search him.

325
00:30:57.015 --> 00:31:02.770
I'll get you. Your wife, your kids.
You think you're the big fella now?

326
00:31:02.854 --> 00:31:06.774
You'll not be so big
the next time you meet me with a bally on.

327
00:31:06.858 --> 00:31:11.529
Yeah? I'm trembling. We can do this
the hard way or the easy way. Your choice.

328
00:31:11.613 --> 00:31:14.657
Let's do it the hard way, huh?

329
00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:17.911
Do you like men with big cocks, do you?
D'you want that, do you?

330
00:31:17.994 --> 00:31:22.165
Is she a lesbian, is she?
You fancy me arse, don't you? You pervert.

331
00:31:22.248 --> 00:31:27.086
All right. Get your designer gear back on
and get the fuck out of my sight.

332
00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.632
There's over £600 there.
You can keep that.

333
00:31:30.715 --> 00:31:33.718
Yous fuckers need it more than I do.

334
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:38.514
Bunch of fucking eejits,
working and paying taxes.

335
00:31:38.598 --> 00:31:43.144
D'you know what? I make more in a week
than yous fuckers earn in a month. Here.

336
00:31:43.228 --> 00:31:46.272
That's more than you earn in a year.

337
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:50.527
Thanks. See you, guys. All the best.

338
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.695
See you soon, Brian.

339
00:31:59.869 --> 00:32:03.706
I always like to go shopping after a funeral.

340
00:32:07.544 --> 00:32:10.255
- What are you doing here?
- It's looking bad for you.

341
00:32:10.338 --> 00:32:14.092
- People say you ordered the hit on Cahill.
- People can say what they like.

342
00:32:14.175 --> 00:32:17.136
I was out of the country at the time.

343
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:22.809
Is that your response, Mr Hutch?
Or should I call you the Monk?

344
00:32:22.892 --> 00:32:25.895
You're invading my privacy
and the privacy of my family.

345
00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:30.859
So if you don't get the fuck off my property,
I'm gonna sue you and your fucking paper.

346
00:32:30.942 --> 00:32:33.027
Now fuck off!

347
00:32:35.405 --> 00:32:37.490
Can I quote you on that?

348
00:32:43.746 --> 00:32:45.832
I can't talk to anyone right now.

349
00:32:45.915 --> 00:32:48.835
It's Tony Gregory.
He's the MP for Dublin Central.

350
00:32:48.918 --> 00:32:53.464
I know who he is. I still can't talk to him.
Tell him to call back later.

351
00:32:53.548 --> 00:32:56.968
- You can tell him yourself.
- Hiya, Tony.

352
00:32:57.051 --> 00:32:59.262
What is this shite?

353
00:32:59.345 --> 00:33:01.973
It's Ireland's finest newspaper, Tony.

354
00:33:02.056 --> 00:33:05.602
"Dublin city is currently
like a tinderbox just waiting to explode. "

355
00:33:05.685 --> 00:33:09.731
- This sounds like self-fulfilling prophecy.
- It's a source quote.

356
00:33:09.814 --> 00:33:11.774
It's not me editorialising.

357
00:33:11.858 --> 00:33:14.736
No north inner-city gang
was involved in Cahill's murder.

358
00:33:14.819 --> 00:33:18.364
The gardai have photos of these gangs
and no witnesses identified them.

359
00:33:18.448 --> 00:33:20.992
The only reason there isn't
a blood bath right now

360
00:33:21.075 --> 00:33:23.661
is because the Cahills
didn't buy your story.

361
00:33:23.745 --> 00:33:27.832
Now, as far as I am concerned,
this woman is reckless and inflammatory.

362
00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:29.876
She treats rumour as fact.

363
00:33:29.959 --> 00:33:32.921
And your newspaper is irresponsible
for publishing it.

364
00:33:33.004 --> 00:33:38.134
Now, I expect to read my response
over my breakfast next Sunday.

365
00:33:39.385 --> 00:33:43.223
- I did nothing wrong.
- I know. Did you corroborate your facts?

366
00:33:43.306 --> 00:33:47.310
I was told by a source who's never
been wrong before. I didn't name Hutch.

367
00:33:47.393 --> 00:33:51.439
I didn't even call him the Monk. I put it
to him. He said he was out of the country.

368
00:33:51.523 --> 00:33:54.859
He said he would sue us,
but he didn't deny it.

369
00:33:54.943 --> 00:33:58.196
- We know that.
- And the lawyers approved it, Aengus.

370
00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:02.617
We don't doubt you, Veronica. It's Gregory.
He's a Member of Parliament for the area.

371
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.870
- He wants to have his say.
- I don't give a shite about that.

372
00:34:05.954 --> 00:34:08.540
What about the source?
He won't go on record?

373
00:34:08.623 --> 00:34:12.794
Course he won't. He's a criminal.
Jesus, this is like being a cop.

374
00:34:12.877 --> 00:34:18.049
Worse. You can't get a search warrant or
a wiretap but you have to prove everything.

375
00:34:18.132 --> 00:34:22.929
Yes. And you want to check
how reliable that source of yours is.

376
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:31.896
Is Traynor about?

377
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:51.541
- Jesus!
- Oh, sorry, John. Just a quick question.

378
00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:56.212
You're not aiming to start a gang war,
are you, between the Cahills and Hutch?

379
00:34:56.296 --> 00:34:59.465
- Jesus. She's famous.
- Shut up, you.

380
00:34:59.549 --> 00:35:03.720
I have a feeling you've been feeding me
a line of shite about the Monk.

381
00:35:03.803 --> 00:35:05.346
What are you talking about?

382
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:09.851
Get the south and north side gangs to kill
each other so someone else can take over.

383
00:35:09.934 --> 00:35:13.771
You're talking out of your arse.
Get outta here. Unless you wanna join in.

384
00:35:13.855 --> 00:35:16.941
You told me you were there, John.

385
00:35:17.025 --> 00:35:21.196
- I've done you a lot of favours.
- I'm the one doing the favours.

386
00:35:21.279 --> 00:35:25.241
I've done you the favours! Don't forget that.

387
00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:28.953
I tell you what I know.
I don't tell you what to do with it.

388
00:35:29.037 --> 00:35:32.040
You come in here calling me a fucking liar!

389
00:35:32.123 --> 00:35:34.626
That's a bit of an overreaction there, John.

390
00:35:43.927 --> 00:35:48.806
- Why don't you come and have a pint?
- Too many journalists for me.

391
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:52.435
You can't join a club
if you ignore the members, Veronica.

392
00:35:52.519 --> 00:35:55.647
I know what they say about me:
no journalistic experience,

393
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:59.943
I'm exaggerating the drug problem,
my sources are unreliable, I can't spell.

394
00:36:00.026 --> 00:36:03.821
- Pretty accurate.
- I know I'm no great writer.

395
00:36:03.905 --> 00:36:07.116
Well, I think you're a poet, Veronica.

396
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.956
Go on. Go on, Cantona!

397
00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:16.876
That's poetry.

398
00:36:17.752 --> 00:36:20.171
- What's the score?
- Nothing-nothing.

399
00:36:20.255 --> 00:36:25.510
Cantona's a fucking vacuum cleaner today,
man. It's unreal.

400
00:36:27.178 --> 00:36:30.348
He's what you call a striker.
Number seven. Watch him.

401
00:36:30.431 --> 00:36:32.809
A striker? What did you say his name was?

402
00:36:32.892 --> 00:36:35.186
Eric Cantona.

403
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.398
Born 26th May 1966.
Led Man United to six cups.

404
00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:41.401
Premier League footballer
of the year in '89. Is that him?

405
00:36:41.484 --> 00:36:45.113
Well, fuck me pink. I think it is, yeah.
Fair play to you.

406
00:36:45.196 --> 00:36:47.991
- I met him.
- You met Eric Cantona?

407
00:36:48.074 --> 00:36:51.077
- What did he say to you?
- Doesn't matter. He's a genius.

408
00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.746
He is a fucking genius, man. He's deadly.

409
00:36:56.249 --> 00:37:01.129
Look at that.
I bet you any money the Monk done that.

410
00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:07.468
Do you fancy going for a pint? There's
a great little pub down the road. Very quiet.

411
00:37:07.552 --> 00:37:11.180
That's almost three million quid.

412
00:37:11.264 --> 00:37:13.725
Where would you hide three million quid?

413
00:37:13.808 --> 00:37:16.436
How could you find any fun
in hiding three million?

414
00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:19.814
Wouldn't you be out on the town
spending it like a mad thing?

415
00:37:19.898 --> 00:37:22.817
Yeah. That's exactly right.

416
00:37:23.568 --> 00:37:26.905
- Good night. Thanks.
- So no pint, now?

417
00:37:27.906 --> 00:37:30.033
Not a chance?

418
00:37:37.665 --> 00:37:41.628
- Well done on the Brinks job, Gerry!
- What the fuck you doing following me?

419
00:37:41.711 --> 00:37:45.423
- I'm gonna write about it.
- I don't give a bollocks what you write.

420
00:37:45.506 --> 00:37:49.427
- What are you doing with the money?
- It's none of your business what I do.

421
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.137
There you go.

422
00:37:51.221 --> 00:37:53.640
You know, I've forgotten my manners.

423
00:37:53.723 --> 00:37:58.520
You've been to my home.
Maybe it's about fucking time I visit yours.

424
00:37:58.603 --> 00:38:02.315
- Straight ahead, sir.
- Thanks. I'll see you again.

425
00:38:05.276 --> 00:38:07.237
- Night, Ma.
- Night, love.

426
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.240
- What are you reading, Ma?
- Just some of me notes.

427
00:38:10.323 --> 00:38:14.452
- On the bad guys?
- No. There's just one bad guy I'm after.

428
00:38:14.536 --> 00:38:19.707
It's the one who's up way past his bedtime.
Now, let's go.

429
00:38:19.791 --> 00:38:24.587
You're getting much too big for
your old ma. I'll have to read you a story.

430
00:38:26.256 --> 00:38:28.341
Jesus.

431
00:38:29.509 --> 00:38:31.594
What the hell was that?

432
00:38:31.678 --> 00:38:34.180
- Stay there.
- All right.

433
00:39:00.999 --> 00:39:03.918
That's great. Thank you.

434
00:39:11.217 --> 00:39:14.262
Ronnie. We're all nervous.

435
00:39:14.345 --> 00:39:16.472
Ma's nervous, I'm nervous.

436
00:39:16.556 --> 00:39:19.475
Even Graham.
He just won't say anything about it.

437
00:39:19.559 --> 00:39:21.686
Everyone knows
it's no use talking to you.

438
00:39:21.769 --> 00:39:25.648
Jimmy, those people issue death threats
if their laundry's folded wrong.

439
00:39:25.732 --> 00:39:28.443
Ma! Ma, where did you put the candles?

440
00:39:28.526 --> 00:39:31.196
They're on top of the bread box!

441
00:39:31.905 --> 00:39:35.200
Ah, right.
Besides, it's not the first.

442
00:39:35.283 --> 00:39:39.078
You remember those religious fanatics
after the Bishop Casey story.

443
00:39:39.162 --> 00:39:41.664
There's always someone.
You get used to them.

444
00:39:41.748 --> 00:39:46.127
No, Ronnie, you get used to cold water,
not bullets. This is madness.

445
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:49.964
You'd do the same. If you saw those kids
on the street, you would do the same.

446
00:39:50.048 --> 00:39:53.885
- Not if there was people shooting at me.
- Ma, look!

447
00:39:54.469 --> 00:39:58.640
- Cathal, that's great! Who gave you that?
- You and Dad.

448
00:39:59.557 --> 00:40:01.643
Yeah.

449
00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:07.440
I am listening, actually. Whoever did it
made sure I was not in the room.

450
00:40:09.192 --> 00:40:11.903
Could you do this? You're better at it.

451
00:40:11.986 --> 00:40:15.073
- There's nothing to worry about.
- Nothing to worry about?

452
00:40:15.156 --> 00:40:19.702
I'm the only Guerin in the phone book.
Who do you think they'll come after next?

453
00:40:19.786 --> 00:40:23.081
Don't flatter yourself, little brother.

454
00:40:23.164 --> 00:40:26.209
Are you going to dance on this
or are you gonna go fast on it?

455
00:40:26.292 --> 00:40:30.255
- Here, give someone else a go.
- Give me a turn!

456
00:41:08.668 --> 00:41:11.087
Are you coming to bed?

457
00:41:12.046 --> 00:41:14.632
- What?
- I know you can hear me. Coming to bed?

458
00:41:14.716 --> 00:41:16.551
I'll be along in a minute.

459
00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:21.180
Fine. Suit yourself.

460
00:41:25.727 --> 00:41:29.480
Turn it down. Turn it down!

461
00:41:30.815 --> 00:41:35.320
Come on. I love it. I love my work.

462
00:41:35.403 --> 00:41:38.948
I'm finally doing something
that can make a difference.

463
00:41:39.032 --> 00:41:41.743
What am I gonna do with you?

464
00:41:42.535 --> 00:41:44.329
- Oh, come on.
- No.

465
00:41:56.382 --> 00:41:58.593
OK.

466
00:42:04.641 --> 00:42:06.726
Come on, man.

467
00:42:07.644 --> 00:42:10.688
Come on. Good boy!

468
00:42:17.737 --> 00:42:19.822
Did we wake you up?

469
00:42:25.662 --> 00:42:30.583
What can I say?
I don't think Gerry Hutch is into drugs.

470
00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:33.878
The Brinks heist, probably.
But drugs is just not his scene.

471
00:42:33.962 --> 00:42:37.215
I understand, but I've been
tracking his movements.

472
00:42:37.298 --> 00:42:41.135
I just need to source the drugs.
The connection's easy. I need your help.

473
00:42:41.219 --> 00:42:46.099
- I need you to stop coming to my office.
- He's got the money.

474
00:42:46.182 --> 00:42:49.811
We're talking about a fella
with no visible source of income

475
00:42:49.894 --> 00:42:52.605
who paid tax on £2 million last year.

476
00:42:52.689 --> 00:42:55.608
It's laundered
through the government's tax amnesty.

477
00:42:55.692 --> 00:42:59.904
- He's got too much money not to be into it.
- In your esteemed journalistic opinion.

478
00:42:59.988 --> 00:43:03.908
I know you seized shipments from Cork.
It's coming from somewhere. Where?

479
00:43:03.992 --> 00:43:08.037
We've impounded drugs from
Liverpool, Scotland, Amsterdam, Pakistan.

480
00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:12.750
You're not the only one trying here, and
Hutch isn't the only one with dirty money.

481
00:43:12.834 --> 00:43:15.837
- Who else you got?
- I could name you a dozen.

482
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.090
Here's the latest candidate,
just in from Interpol.

483
00:43:19.173 --> 00:43:21.759
John Gilligan, one year
out of Portlaoise Prison.

484
00:43:21.843 --> 00:43:24.262
Can you tell me
how this Ballyfermot lowlife

485
00:43:24.345 --> 00:43:29.225
has £300,000 to launder in an Amsterdam
casino? You're the star journalist.

486
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:31.519
Gilligan. Certainly keeps a low profile.

487
00:43:31.603 --> 00:43:32.770
Yeah?

488
00:43:32.854 --> 00:43:35.481
Hi, Aengus. Yeah, can you hold?

489
00:43:35.565 --> 00:43:37.442
- Can I... ?
- Go on. It's a copy.

490
00:43:37.525 --> 00:43:39.485
- Great.
- Just go.

491
00:43:39.569 --> 00:43:41.654
I owe you lunch.

492
00:43:43.323 --> 00:43:46.367
No, run the Brinks story.
Just hold off on the drugs claim.

493
00:43:46.451 --> 00:43:49.913
What for? This stuff you sent is great.

494
00:43:49.996 --> 00:43:53.333
Just give me 24 hours.
I got a tip. This could be big.

495
00:43:53.416 --> 00:43:58.421
- I'm trusting you on this one, Veronica.
- Oh, aren't you great!

496
00:44:09.224 --> 00:44:11.726
Nice tan there, John!

497
00:44:13.436 --> 00:44:15.813
Hope there's no hard feelings between us.

498
00:44:15.897 --> 00:44:21.611
I'm not one to take a bullet
through my window personally.

499
00:44:21.694 --> 00:44:24.113
Get lost.

500
00:44:24.197 --> 00:44:27.325
I told you to be careful
with the likes of Gerry Hutch.

501
00:44:27.408 --> 00:44:31.913
But you didn't tell me
about a fella named Gilligan.

502
00:44:31.996 --> 00:44:32.997
Who?

503
00:44:33.081 --> 00:44:35.917
You provided him with a car
when he got out of prison.

504
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.628
John Gilligan. Do you want me to spell it?

505
00:44:38.711 --> 00:44:42.215
I run a bleedin' garage.
I provide loads of cars to people.

506
00:44:42.298 --> 00:44:45.176
Hardly gonna remember
every one of them, now, am I?

507
00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:49.931
- Is that him there?
- Why should I give a shite?

508
00:44:50.014 --> 00:44:55.144
No reason, really. Just the fella behind
the security guard looks a lot like you.

509
00:44:56.521 --> 00:45:00.108
- Now, there's a coincidence.
- Where's his money coming from?

510
00:45:00.191 --> 00:45:02.569
Is he providing
hash and heroin to Mitchell?

511
00:45:02.652 --> 00:45:06.197
I can't help you, Veronica.
Don't know nothing about him.

512
00:45:06.281 --> 00:45:09.200
If I hear of anything,
I'll let you know, OK? Molly!

513
00:45:09.284 --> 00:45:13.454
You can keep the photo if you like.
It's a nice one of you. We got plenty.

514
00:45:18.293 --> 00:45:21.337
- You sell horses yourself?
- I do.

515
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:25.717
- You have a number.
- I sell them on to Germany mostly.

516
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.596
Myself and Geraldine are planning
to make this the largest and finest

517
00:45:29.679 --> 00:45:33.600
equestrian centre in all of Ireland.

518
00:45:33.683 --> 00:45:37.020
Well, I must say the size is impressive.

519
00:45:37.103 --> 00:45:38.980
Said the nun to the sailor.

520
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:46.112
How about an aperitif?
Some champers, caviar? It's all imported.

521
00:45:46.196 --> 00:45:49.490
John and I have great plans for this place.

522
00:45:49.574 --> 00:45:51.659
Hang on.

523
00:45:52.994 --> 00:45:55.079
Hello?

524
00:45:55.163 --> 00:45:56.456
- Hello?
- John...

525
00:45:56.539 --> 00:46:00.043
You're breaking up there. Hello?

526
00:46:00.126 --> 00:46:02.170
- It's Traynor.
- Johnny.

527
00:46:02.253 --> 00:46:06.591
Listen, Veronica Guerin's got hold of
a photo of us in Amsterdam.

528
00:46:06.674 --> 00:46:13.097
But, John, I swear I had nothing
to do with it. I never mentioned your name.

529
00:46:13.181 --> 00:46:15.266
But she was asking about you.

530
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:21.564
Johnny, I told you before, if she so much
as mentions my fucking name, you pay.

531
00:46:24.734 --> 00:46:27.028
Fucking eejits!

532
00:46:27.111 --> 00:46:29.197
Fuck 'em!

533
00:46:34.494 --> 00:46:36.579
Happy Christmas!

534
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:42.168
- Now, isn't this great?
- When's Mum coming here?

535
00:46:42.252 --> 00:46:46.047
She'll be here soon.
We'll want something stronger than that.

536
00:46:51.177 --> 00:46:53.638
Yeah? Ma, how are you?

537
00:46:53.721 --> 00:46:57.058
- Happy Christmas, Ann. You look great.
- Happy Christmas.

538
00:46:57.141 --> 00:47:01.020
- Where's your mum?
- You know her. Always going for the gold.

539
00:47:01.938 --> 00:47:03.857
All right.

540
00:47:05.066 --> 00:47:06.818
There's someone at the door, Ma.

541
00:47:06.901 --> 00:47:10.446
My phone'll be on all night.
You can call me whenever you want.

542
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.658
I love you too. OK. Bye. Bye.

543
00:47:21.332 --> 00:47:23.710
Yeah, all right, all right.

544
00:48:31.903 --> 00:48:34.405
Veronica's been shot!

545
00:48:40.453 --> 00:48:41.496
How are you?

546
00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:43.873
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous.

547
00:48:43.957 --> 00:48:47.585
- Look at you. For God's sake.
- Hey, Willy.

548
00:48:49.045 --> 00:48:51.923
Can't find any sport on. Can you believe it?

549
00:48:52.006 --> 00:48:55.885
... extensive investigations
into organised crime in Dublin...

550
00:48:55.969 --> 00:48:59.556
Why do they always use
that brutal picture?

551
00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:01.474
It was a very serious incident.

552
00:49:01.558 --> 00:49:05.520
Veronica Guerin
is a very talented journalist.

553
00:49:05.603 --> 00:49:09.649
An attack like this could be seen
as an attempt to muzzle her

554
00:49:09.732 --> 00:49:14.696
because of certain publications
or articles she wrote.

555
00:49:14.779 --> 00:49:18.116
This would be connected
with last month's £3 million robbery?

556
00:49:18.199 --> 00:49:21.828
We all know who pulled that one,
don't we, Hutch? He threatened me.

557
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:25.623
Veronica, please, stop this.
Write about fashion, about football.

558
00:49:25.707 --> 00:49:29.836
Write about anything you like, but stop this.
You don't have to do it any more.

559
00:49:29.919 --> 00:49:35.049
I don't see myself covering the catwalks
or doing a gardening column, Aengus.

560
00:49:35.133 --> 00:49:38.177
You've always wanted
to write about politics.

561
00:49:38.261 --> 00:49:40.555
I am. Drugs are political.

562
00:49:40.638 --> 00:49:43.600
What if I told you
I wouldn't publish your stuff any more?

563
00:49:43.683 --> 00:49:45.560
But you never would tell me that.

564
00:49:45.643 --> 00:49:48.479
For Christ's sake, there's no sport channel.

565
00:49:48.563 --> 00:49:51.316
- We have to go.
- What kind of hospital is this?

566
00:49:51.399 --> 00:49:53.985
Is this what we pay health insurance for?

567
00:49:54.068 --> 00:49:56.863
- Where Cathal?
- He's at your sister's with your mum.

568
00:49:56.946 --> 00:49:58.865
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

569
00:49:59.824 --> 00:50:02.619
Right. We've just got you
24-hour police protection.

570
00:50:02.702 --> 00:50:04.787
- OK?
- Grand.

571
00:50:05.872 --> 00:50:10.627
What a way to spend Christmas Eve,
looking at the poxy box.

572
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:13.546
Mary Poppins. Gone with the Wind.

573
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:17.425
Next thing you know
it'll be A Wonderful fucking Life.

574
00:50:17.508 --> 00:50:20.261
The doctor says it missed
the artery and the bone.

575
00:50:20.345 --> 00:50:24.766
Point-blank range
with a. 45, and this is all they could do.

576
00:50:24.849 --> 00:50:27.435
- Where's Cathal? How is he?
- He's fine.

577
00:50:27.519 --> 00:50:30.647
Where is he? Oh, yeah. He's with Mum.

578
00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:33.775
- Yeah. He keeps asking for you.
- Yeah?

579
00:50:35.652 --> 00:50:39.322
... shooting happened shortly after...
... investigations for the...

580
00:50:39.405 --> 00:50:42.075
... warning from a crime gang.

581
00:50:44.536 --> 00:50:46.621
You gonna stop this now?

582
00:51:02.554 --> 00:51:04.848
Nan, look! It's Mum!

583
00:51:21.364 --> 00:51:24.534
- Give me the keys.
- I know what I'm doing, Graham.

584
00:51:24.617 --> 00:51:28.955
- They shot me cos I'm on the right track.
- Give me the keys, please.

585
00:51:29.038 --> 00:51:31.708
- Thank you.
- Would you give me the keys?

586
00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:33.626
No.

587
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.212
Look at the state of you.

588
00:51:38.047 --> 00:51:40.717
Do you think I want to do this, do you?

589
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.887
I don't want to do it. I have to do it.

590
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:47.849
You're a journalist. You write.
You let the Gards look after this.

591
00:51:47.932 --> 00:51:52.228
Oh, Graham, come off it. The Gards
can't do anything. They'll get away with it.

592
00:51:52.312 --> 00:51:54.772
- 14 shootings in 14 months.
- You're one of them.

593
00:51:54.856 --> 00:51:57.775
I know who the guys are.
Would you just give me the keys?

594
00:51:57.859 --> 00:52:00.904
No. Tough shit.

595
00:52:00.987 --> 00:52:03.698
Come on inside. Please.

596
00:52:03.781 --> 00:52:07.368
They're not getting away with it.
I'll catch a cab, then.

597
00:52:07.452 --> 00:52:09.537
Oh, for God's sake.

598
00:52:11.623 --> 00:52:13.708
Ah, Jesus Christ.

599
00:52:14.709 --> 00:52:17.295
Yeah, hi. It's Veronica Guerin. I'd like a...

600
00:52:17.378 --> 00:52:20.423
Thank you. Come on. Get in.

601
00:52:21.424 --> 00:52:24.344
- Who's driving?
- You can't drive with two good legs.

602
00:52:24.427 --> 00:52:27.764
- You think I'll let you drive with one?
- That's low, that is.

603
00:52:27.847 --> 00:52:33.019
- You drive like an old granny.
- Come on, Hopalong, get in.

604
00:52:33.895 --> 00:52:37.398
Where is she going? She only got out
the hospital a couple of days ago.

605
00:52:37.482 --> 00:52:39.567
I know.

606
00:52:49.285 --> 00:52:51.371
You let me do it.

607
00:52:58.127 --> 00:53:02.757
Look! Veronica Guerin.
Come here. Have a look.

608
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.926
Tommy Mullen?

609
00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.234
Fatso Mitchell?

610
00:53:22.193 --> 00:53:24.696
- Yeah.
- This is for you.

611
00:53:29.534 --> 00:53:31.619
Get the fuck out of here. Here!

612
00:53:35.164 --> 00:53:39.878
- Your column's upsetting me mother.
- Ah, you poor fella.

613
00:53:39.961 --> 00:53:45.008
You think I'm a drug dealer, don't you?
Well, I'm no drug dealer.

614
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:49.971
I've seen family and friends dying
week in, week out because of 'em.

615
00:53:50.054 --> 00:53:53.433
All right. Why did you shoot me?

616
00:53:56.060 --> 00:54:00.732
No, I had nothing to do with shooting you.
I wouldn't have missed.

617
00:54:08.531 --> 00:54:11.492
I'm telling you, he isn't here.

618
00:54:11.576 --> 00:54:14.621
And I have to go. I'm busy.

619
00:54:14.704 --> 00:54:17.540
- How old are you?
- None of your business.

620
00:54:17.624 --> 00:54:20.752
Please, just give this to Traynor.

621
00:54:22.086 --> 00:54:25.048
Are you gonna be OK?
I mean, your leg and all?

622
00:54:25.131 --> 00:54:27.467
Yeah, I'm grand.

623
00:54:28.259 --> 00:54:30.637
Are you gonna be all right?

624
00:54:35.517 --> 00:54:40.271
And I thought... I mean, I've always
believed that... Well, I'm a journalist.

625
00:54:40.355 --> 00:54:45.360
Nobody shoots the messenger.
I mean, a journalist doesn't get shot.

626
00:54:45.443 --> 00:54:49.906
If the bullet had hit an artery,
you could have died.

627
00:54:49.989 --> 00:54:52.784
So why do you do it?
Why do you take the risks?

628
00:54:52.867 --> 00:54:59.541
Well, I'll give her this. It takes some balls
to shoot yourself in the leg for publicity.

629
00:54:59.624 --> 00:55:03.211
- She should have shot herself in the balls.
- Bigger target.

630
00:55:03.294 --> 00:55:07.799
- Shall we?
- Never liked this place anyway.

631
00:55:07.882 --> 00:55:13.596
She can always use the insurance money
for a course in journalism.

632
00:55:28.528 --> 00:55:31.322
Here. Check this out.

633
00:55:31.406 --> 00:55:35.159
... bringing to the attention
of the public generally

634
00:55:35.243 --> 00:55:40.498
a culture that exists in our society
that nobody knows anything about.

635
00:55:40.582 --> 00:55:43.501
Your girlfriend's looking
very fucking healthy.

636
00:55:43.585 --> 00:55:45.962
Too bad the moron you hired
shot her in the leg.

637
00:55:46.045 --> 00:55:49.591
Now the whole country's watching her,
thanks to you.

638
00:55:49.674 --> 00:55:53.386
She's a real martyr, thanks to you, Coach.

639
00:55:53.469 --> 00:55:56.514
Saint Veronica of the Sunday Independent.

640
00:55:56.598 --> 00:56:02.103
Relax, will you? She's convinced
it was Gerry Hutch that done it.

641
00:56:02.187 --> 00:56:04.898
You better pray she stays that way.

642
00:56:04.981 --> 00:56:07.192
Come on.

643
00:56:07.275 --> 00:56:09.736
Champagne - now.

644
00:56:09.819 --> 00:56:14.115
These letters that you delivered.
What did you say in them?

645
00:56:14.199 --> 00:56:16.910
There was one simple question
on each of the letters,

646
00:56:16.993 --> 00:56:21.164
and it was
"Were you responsible for my attack?"

647
00:56:32.717 --> 00:56:34.802
Mr Gregory?

648
00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:38.973
What are you doing here? How did you get
past Security? You can't just barge in.

649
00:56:39.057 --> 00:56:42.060
I'm sorry. Do you mind if I sit down?

650
00:56:42.894 --> 00:56:48.066
A young woman wounded, on a crutch.
I'd be at a disadvantage. Take a seat.

651
00:56:48.149 --> 00:56:51.569
I've come to apologise,
if I've got it all wrong.

652
00:56:51.653 --> 00:56:55.198
All of you journalists have got it wrong.

653
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:58.660
You call these guys the Viper,
the Monk, the General.

654
00:56:58.743 --> 00:57:01.079
You glorify them. They're not movie stars.

655
00:57:01.162 --> 00:57:03.873
With respect, I've no option.

656
00:57:03.957 --> 00:57:07.293
I can't name them.
Your libel laws won't let me.

657
00:57:07.377 --> 00:57:10.046
Journalists are going to jail
for doing their job.

658
00:57:10.129 --> 00:57:13.967
Liz Allen, she's facing imprisonment
for exposing these murderers.

659
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:16.886
I'm not getting involved
in your personal vendettas.

660
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:20.682
- I'm not here because I was shot.
- Now we know what you're not here for.

661
00:57:20.765 --> 00:57:26.521
Look, I've been writing quite extensively,
in a balanced way, for the past 18 months.

662
00:57:26.604 --> 00:57:32.068
You must have missed some of my articles.
On June 11th - I just want to clarify this -

663
00:57:32.151 --> 00:57:35.780
I suggested extending
detention periods for drug offenders.

664
00:57:35.864 --> 00:57:40.076
Then on July 16th I wrote about
tax officials - I mean, this is ridiculous -

665
00:57:40.159 --> 00:57:43.121
saying that they are paid
only to record declared income,

666
00:57:43.204 --> 00:57:45.999
not to worry about
whether it comes from drugs.

667
00:57:46.082 --> 00:57:48.793
Then on July 23rd
I wrote about the gardai.

668
00:57:48.877 --> 00:57:53.715
They can seize drug proceeds but can't
hold them. How frustrating is that?

669
00:57:53.798 --> 00:57:58.094
I don't need you to tell me the fight against
drugs has been hampered, crippled,

670
00:57:58.178 --> 00:58:00.847
by the laws that we have at the moment.

671
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:05.268
- We're on the same side, Mr Gregory.
- We're on the same side?

672
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:09.355
I don't like your methods,
and I do not like your paper.

673
00:58:09.439 --> 00:58:14.027
Yeah. It's a rag. But it's a popular rag.

674
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:16.863
Use it. Get your message out. Use me.

675
00:58:16.946 --> 00:58:20.074
You've got to change these laws
that favour the criminals.

676
00:58:20.158 --> 00:58:24.078
When do we get to the part where
you use me? Or is this just a charity offer?

677
00:58:24.162 --> 00:58:29.792
Well, I'm looking into a guy called Gilligan.
Just take my phone calls.

678
00:58:35.548 --> 00:58:38.051
Gilligan, did you say?

679
00:58:38.134 --> 00:58:41.721
Friend of mine said he rents these
containers out. Seen him about much?

680
00:58:41.804 --> 00:58:45.058
Slightly overweight, like? Bald guy?

681
00:58:45.141 --> 00:58:47.685
We've never seen him here.

682
00:58:47.769 --> 00:58:50.355
- Thanks for the smoke.
- Yeah.

683
00:58:56.236 --> 00:59:01.783
Willy, do me a favour, will you? Find out
how long Tony Gregory'll be in his office.

684
00:59:01.866 --> 00:59:04.244
Hiya. Look, no offence,

685
00:59:04.327 --> 00:59:08.957
but these guys are not gonna talk to me
with the cops hanging about. All right?

686
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.501
- Right.
- Thanks. It's not working.

687
00:59:11.584 --> 00:59:16.381
Gilligan's listed here as living
in a council flat on the dole.

688
00:59:16.464 --> 00:59:18.591
That's just a mailing address.

689
00:59:18.675 --> 00:59:24.138
Those lads go to meetings with their
probation officers in BMWs and Mercedes.

690
00:59:24.222 --> 00:59:27.767
Having money isn't a probation violation.

691
00:59:27.851 --> 00:59:30.645
It is if the assets are illegal.

692
00:59:30.728 --> 00:59:35.441
Now, then I'd like to see a register
of ownership for the following properties,

693
00:59:35.525 --> 00:59:39.612
and this corporation here,
with a copy of the shareholders reports.

694
00:59:39.696 --> 00:59:43.825
And the same for these other companies
run by a man named John Gilligan.

695
00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:54.794
I told you, this office is closed for lunch,

696
00:59:54.878 --> 00:59:58.715
so unless you're on staff or with
the government, it's always closed to you.

697
00:59:58.798 --> 01:00:01.801
Not a problem. I've got a friend
who'd like to talk to you.

698
01:00:01.885 --> 01:00:04.053
Do you know Tony Gregory?

699
01:00:24.407 --> 01:00:26.951
Oh, you're an angel.

700
01:00:27.035 --> 01:00:31.039
- I'm just finishing up.
- You're a bad liar.

701
01:00:31.122 --> 01:00:33.374
Oh, God.
You make the worst cup of coffee.

702
01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:37.003
Here. I'll help you put Cathal to bed.

703
01:00:37.086 --> 01:00:39.589
He's been asleep for an hour.

704
01:00:40.882 --> 01:00:42.967
Of course.

705
01:00:45.637 --> 01:00:51.476
Don't you ever just wanna keep him
in the house? Not let him out ever?

706
01:00:51.559 --> 01:00:55.188
Yeah. But mostly I feel that way about you.

707
01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.658
I've got him, Graham. I've got his name.

708
01:01:07.575 --> 01:01:11.204
I'm gonna get this Gilligan bastard.

709
01:01:11.287 --> 01:01:14.624
I am so close, you know. I'm this close.

710
01:01:19.087 --> 01:01:21.631
Do you trust me?

711
01:01:21.714 --> 01:01:23.216
Right?

712
01:01:23.299 --> 01:01:25.385
Don't worry.

713
01:01:26.719 --> 01:01:29.222
Easy for you to say.

714
01:02:23.693 --> 01:02:27.488
How are you? Do you know
where I might find Mr Gilligan?

715
01:02:31.743 --> 01:02:34.662
- Sorry. Don't know.
- Right.

716
01:03:34.931 --> 01:03:39.936
Mr Gilligan? I'm Veronica Guerin
from the Sunday Independent.

717
01:03:40.019 --> 01:03:43.189
I've come to ask some questions
about your property ownership,

718
01:03:43.273 --> 01:03:48.611
including this lovely
equestrian centre you've got here.

719
01:03:48.695 --> 01:03:51.906
You could start by telling me
where you get the money.

720
01:03:55.451 --> 01:03:58.413
Cunt! Cunt!

721
01:03:58.913 --> 01:04:00.999
Cunt!

722
01:04:04.544 --> 01:04:06.963
Cunt! Cunt!

723
01:04:18.933 --> 01:04:23.521
- Are you wearing a wire?
- No! No!

724
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:26.816
Get off my property, you cunt!

725
01:05:20.161 --> 01:05:23.915
Jesus! Jesus, what happened to you?

726
01:05:23.998 --> 01:05:27.752
What happened to you, darling? God! God!

727
01:05:27.835 --> 01:05:29.921
What happened to you?

728
01:05:31.506 --> 01:05:34.425
Oh, my darling. Oh, my darling.

729
01:05:40.682 --> 01:05:42.725
Can you see it all?

730
01:05:42.809 --> 01:05:44.894
Right.

731
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.071
- Are you ready to go home?
- Yeah.

732
01:05:55.154 --> 01:05:58.491
- You wanna try a drop of that?
- Thanks.

733
01:06:00.243 --> 01:06:03.246
Look, it's up to you, Ronnie,

734
01:06:03.329 --> 01:06:07.792
but if you do press charges,
writing their story might prejudice the case.

735
01:06:07.876 --> 01:06:10.253
I know you. You just want to steal it.

736
01:06:10.336 --> 01:06:12.922
Of course I do. I'm a reporter.

737
01:06:13.965 --> 01:06:20.930
So what's it to be, Veronica? Do you want
the story or do you want to press charges?

738
01:06:43.328 --> 01:06:45.413
Yeah?

739
01:06:45.955 --> 01:06:48.041
This is John Gilligan.

740
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:51.669
If you do one thing on me,

741
01:06:53.213 --> 01:06:57.550
if you go to the gardai or write about me,

742
01:06:58.384 --> 01:07:03.806
I'm gonna kidnap your son
and I'm gonna ride him.

743
01:07:04.974 --> 01:07:07.060
I'm gonna shoot you.

744
01:07:08.853 --> 01:07:12.065
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

745
01:07:12.148 --> 01:07:17.820
I'm gonna fucking kidnap your son
and I'm gonna ride him,

746
01:07:17.904 --> 01:07:20.406
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

747
01:07:21.199 --> 01:07:23.910
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

748
01:07:42.804 --> 01:07:44.806
- Veronica.
- Where's Cathal?

749
01:07:44.889 --> 01:07:46.474
- What's wrong?
- Where's Cathal?

750
01:07:46.558 --> 01:07:49.644
He's in the country.
He's with your sister. He's safe.

751
01:07:49.727 --> 01:07:51.813
Jesus.

752
01:07:53.648 --> 01:07:56.109
- It was him.
- What?

753
01:07:56.192 --> 01:08:00.572
I should never have gone there. Oh, Jesus!

754
01:08:00.655 --> 01:08:05.243
- I'm so scared, Graham. I'm really scared.
- I know, I know, I know.

755
01:08:05.326 --> 01:08:07.620
It's going to be all right.

756
01:08:13.459 --> 01:08:17.213
- I want you to promise me something.
- What?

757
01:08:19.841 --> 01:08:22.719
- Don't tell anyone I was like this.
- What?

758
01:08:22.802 --> 01:08:25.096
All right?

759
01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.766
- I don't want them to have it.
- All right.

760
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:31.477
That's what they want more than anything.

761
01:08:31.561 --> 01:08:34.772
I promise you. You were never afraid.

762
01:08:34.856 --> 01:08:37.859
All right. Oh, Jesus.

763
01:08:37.942 --> 01:08:40.028
Never afraid.

764
01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.627
Jesus, Veronica. Look at you.

765
01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.879
I'll live.

766
01:08:57.962 --> 01:09:00.089
How are you, John?

767
01:09:00.173 --> 01:09:03.760
It's... been a while.

768
01:09:03.843 --> 01:09:05.929
I'm grand. Get you a drink?

769
01:09:06.012 --> 01:09:08.348
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

770
01:09:08.431 --> 01:09:11.559
So, what do you want to talk about?

771
01:09:16.231 --> 01:09:22.070
- I've a message for you from John Gilligan.
- The man you don't know.

772
01:09:22.153 --> 01:09:28.284
As soon as I heard, I went to see him.
I told him he'd got it all wrong.

773
01:09:28.368 --> 01:09:31.204
He's a small man with a chip. You know.

774
01:09:31.287 --> 01:09:34.415
He's got a temper. He just lost his head.

775
01:09:34.499 --> 01:09:38.127
Anyway, he wants you to know
that he's sorry for what he done,

776
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:42.340
and for what he said
about your kid and the family.

777
01:09:42.423 --> 01:09:44.926
He'd never do those things.

778
01:09:46.135 --> 01:09:48.847
He wishes he could take it back.

779
01:09:49.764 --> 01:09:54.143
Gilligan got you to feed me
that shite about Hutch.

780
01:09:55.270 --> 01:10:00.149
Yeah. He murdered Cahill, stepped back
and let the IRA take credit.

781
01:10:00.233 --> 01:10:04.571
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm here because he wants this to end

782
01:10:04.654 --> 01:10:07.031
before things get any worse.

783
01:10:07.115 --> 01:10:09.534
How can it get any worse?

784
01:10:09.617 --> 01:10:13.246
Things can always get worse, Veronica.

785
01:10:15.999 --> 01:10:23.131
Now, if you don't press charges,
you'll be £100,000 richer within an hour.

786
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.928
It's not enough. I want 300.

787
01:10:34.726 --> 01:10:37.812
- I think I could get you that.
- Right.

788
01:10:38.938 --> 01:10:41.733
You tell Gilligan that
he's not gonna be buying me off.

789
01:10:41.816 --> 01:10:46.279
Nobody's trying to buy you off.
The man just wants to be fair, that's all.

790
01:10:46.362 --> 01:10:49.032
Even if he's convicted,
all he'll get is six months.

791
01:10:49.115 --> 01:10:52.994
Right, well, if he's not worried,
why is he prepared to pay so much?

792
01:10:53.077 --> 01:10:56.414
Why did he bother sending a messenger?

793
01:10:58.208 --> 01:11:02.045
You're not the Coach at all,
are you, Johnny?

794
01:11:02.128 --> 01:11:04.506
You're the ball boy.

795
01:11:04.589 --> 01:11:09.177
What are you doing,
talking to her like this, after what you did?

796
01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.222
What the fuck are you doing here?
Get out of here.

797
01:11:12.305 --> 01:11:16.309
- He sent that man to shoot you.
- That's a load of bollocks.

798
01:11:16.392 --> 01:11:18.937
- Don't listen to this junkie slag.
- It's true.

799
01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:23.858
He said the man was supposed to shoot
you in the head, but the gun didn't work.

800
01:11:23.942 --> 01:11:25.610
Veronica!

801
01:12:07.443 --> 01:12:14.033
I've decided to make a formal complaint
against the guy who beat me.

802
01:12:14.117 --> 01:12:19.247
I mean, I would... I would lose a lot,

803
01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:23.877
right, if I was to give in to these thugs,
and I'm not going to be doing that,

804
01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.421
because it'd be worse for me
and for journalism

805
01:12:26.504 --> 01:12:30.508
if I or any journalist was to be intimidated.

806
01:12:30.592 --> 01:12:32.594
That means they've won.

807
01:12:32.677 --> 01:12:35.138
And they're not going to win.

808
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:37.682
Fuck off!

809
01:12:37.765 --> 01:12:42.228
"The house shuddered and collapsed,

810
01:12:42.312 --> 01:12:44.606
and then the little people discovered

811
01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:49.152
that they were disappearing
into a swirl of leaves. "

812
01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:57.535
He's fast asleep.

813
01:12:57.619 --> 01:12:59.871
Thanks for watching him, Ma.

814
01:12:59.954 --> 01:13:04.500
What should a girl wear to court?
Maybe the navy.

815
01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:08.129
- This one looks grand.
- Oh, look.

816
01:13:09.088 --> 01:13:11.841
Ah, look at that.

817
01:13:15.094 --> 01:13:19.557
Look at you always trying
to be better than the boys.

818
01:13:20.558 --> 01:13:25.063
That reminds me, you know, of a day -
I don't know how old you were.

819
01:13:25.146 --> 01:13:29.526
You were out playing football and the ball
went over the wall into Old Man Clancy's.

820
01:13:29.609 --> 01:13:33.655
Do you remember him? He was
a very dangerous man. Very violent.

821
01:13:33.738 --> 01:13:36.658
The boys did nothing,
but you, bold as brass,

822
01:13:36.741 --> 01:13:41.287
you marched up those steps
and you just knocked on his door.

823
01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:45.333
- Scared the bejasus out of me.
- You didn't show it.

824
01:13:45.416 --> 01:13:49.462
That's your thing, isn't it?
You don't show your fear.

825
01:13:49.546 --> 01:13:56.010
You know, Veronica, sometimes it's wiser
to let the crazy old man keep the ball.

826
01:13:56.094 --> 01:14:00.473
It is, and sometimes
it's braver to just walk away.

827
01:14:02.559 --> 01:14:05.937
Well, I got the ball back, didn't I?

828
01:14:09.148 --> 01:14:12.068
You know exactly what I mean.

829
01:14:28.418 --> 01:14:35.925
In response to a motion by the defence,
I'm granting an extension until June 30th.

830
01:14:37.051 --> 01:14:40.430
- This hearing is adjourned.
- I'm sorry.

831
01:14:46.436 --> 01:14:49.939
Hey. You haven't seen
the last of us, missis.

832
01:15:03.578 --> 01:15:04.996
Cheers.

833
01:15:23.389 --> 01:15:25.600
You all right?

834
01:15:25.683 --> 01:15:28.436
I've got a speeding issue
to deal with tomorrow.

835
01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.731
You're big in Naas. You haven't
bought off any judges, have you?

836
01:15:31.814 --> 01:15:33.358
- Who is it?
- Ballaugh.

837
01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:38.196
Can't help you. I hope you didn't take
what that junkie slag said seriously.

838
01:15:38.279 --> 01:15:41.074
Her brain burned out months ago.

839
01:15:41.157 --> 01:15:45.203
And you didn't call me here
to talk about a speeding ticket.

840
01:15:45.286 --> 01:15:48.206
Changed your mind about Gilligan's offer?

841
01:15:49.332 --> 01:15:52.335
I'm writing a story.
Just want to clear some things up.

842
01:15:52.418 --> 01:15:56.756
- You're my man.
- What do you wanna know?

843
01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.969
How you guys launder all the money
you're making from the drug deals.

844
01:16:01.052 --> 01:16:04.389
- Is it the Amsterdam casinos?
- Are you saying I'm a drug dealer?

845
01:16:04.472 --> 01:16:09.978
Would you talk straight to me? The two car
franchises, the yacht, the house, holidays.

846
01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:14.691
All that comes from the brothels? Don't the
taxmen ask where the money comes from?

847
01:16:14.774 --> 01:16:18.987
You think I'd threaten those tax fellas?
That's bullshit. I was with me accountant.

848
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:23.867
The taxman was very fair.
I'm legit. They can't touch me.

849
01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:27.829
Who shot me, John?

850
01:16:28.413 --> 01:16:32.959
- You know as well as I do, Veronica.
- Yeah. I need to hear it from you.

851
01:16:33.042 --> 01:16:35.128
Gerry Hutch.

852
01:16:40.842 --> 01:16:45.722
- Cos you're Gilligan's partner, right?
- Look, I'm a fairly minor player.

853
01:16:45.805 --> 01:16:48.141
You've seen Gilligan's house.

854
01:16:48.224 --> 01:16:52.687
He has a two or three million fucking horse
shed out the front that'll hold 8,000 people.

855
01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:55.690
I'm not in his league.

856
01:16:55.773 --> 01:17:00.862
So why are you asking me all
these questions? What's the story about?

857
01:17:00.945 --> 01:17:03.031
You.

858
01:17:04.616 --> 01:17:06.326
- Me?
- Yeah.

859
01:17:06.409 --> 01:17:09.454
I'm gonna say you're a dealer,
name you, quote you on Hutch.

860
01:17:09.537 --> 01:17:12.040
- You can't do that, Veronica.
- I think I can.

861
01:17:12.123 --> 01:17:15.376
- You do that and I'm a fucking dead man.
- You poor fella.

862
01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:19.297
Listen to me, Veronica,
I'm trying to fucking help you.

863
01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:23.760
Take Gilligan's offer. I can't control him,
and you don't know how far he'll go

864
01:17:23.843 --> 01:17:25.929
to keep from going back to prison.

865
01:17:26.012 --> 01:17:28.515
I came with a photographer from the paper.

866
01:17:28.598 --> 01:17:33.061
He's standing over there
next to the police. Smile.

867
01:17:38.066 --> 01:17:40.109
Let go of my door, John.

868
01:18:32.912 --> 01:18:35.248
Hello? Just a minute. Hello?

869
01:18:36.875 --> 01:18:41.129
She'll be at the Naas Courthouse
tomorrow morning.

870
01:19:12.243 --> 01:19:14.412
Come the fuck with me. Go on.

871
01:19:56.788 --> 01:19:58.957
£100 fine.

872
01:20:00.416 --> 01:20:02.502
Thank you.

873
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.755
Well done.

874
01:21:09.569 --> 01:21:11.654
She's out.

875
01:21:25.168 --> 01:21:29.005
Mum, I'm driving!
Can you believe it? He let me off.

876
01:21:29.088 --> 01:21:32.509
He actually let me off.
I love you. Talk to you.

877
01:21:43.353 --> 01:21:47.524
Yeah. Another repeat offender
returned to decent society.

878
01:22:08.253 --> 01:22:10.547
She's on her way.

879
01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.482
I told him I was guilty as sin.

880
01:23:50.146 --> 01:23:52.232
Veronica?

881
01:23:53.983 --> 01:23:56.194
Veronica?

882
01:27:46.758 --> 01:27:52.013
Veronica Guerin's writing
turned the tide in the drug war.

883
01:27:52.096 --> 01:27:56.267
Her murder galvanised Ireland into action.

884
01:27:56.351 --> 01:28:00.772
Thousands of people took to the streets
in weekly anti-drug marches,

885
01:28:00.855 --> 01:28:07.612
which drove the dealers out of Dublin
and forced the drug barons underground.

886
01:28:18.748 --> 01:28:23.127
Within a week of her death, during
an emergency session of Parliament,

887
01:28:23.211 --> 01:28:26.840
the government altered the constitution
of the Republic of Ireland

888
01:28:26.923 --> 01:28:32.971
to allow the high court to freeze
the assets of suspected drug barons.

889
01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:48.820
That same year, the Criminal
Assets Bureau, CAB, was formed

890
01:28:48.903 --> 01:28:50.989
and given the power to access and seize

891
01:28:51.072 --> 01:28:55.243
unexplained wealth
from suspected criminals.

892
01:29:10.967 --> 01:29:15.346
Charles Bowden turned state's evidence
and became the first person in Irish history

893
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:20.101
to be entered into
the witness protection programme.

894
01:29:34.574 --> 01:29:37.076
Brian Meehan was sentenced
to life imprisonment

895
01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.245
for the murder of Veronica Guerin,

896
01:29:39.329 --> 01:29:42.457
and his assets were seized by the CAB.

897
01:29:47.128 --> 01:29:51.090
Eugene Holland was sentenced
to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking.

898
01:29:51.174 --> 01:29:53.760
His assets were seized by CAB.

899
01:29:56.429 --> 01:29:58.515
John Traynor escaped to Portugal

900
01:29:58.598 --> 01:30:02.477
and continues to fight extradition
to Ireland on charges of murder.

901
01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.688
His assets were seized by the CAB.

902
01:30:18.535 --> 01:30:20.495
After a long extradition battle,

903
01:30:20.578 --> 01:30:23.414
John Gilligan was brought back to Ireland
from England

904
01:30:23.498 --> 01:30:27.460
and sentenced to
28 years in prison for drug trafficking.

905
01:30:27.544 --> 01:30:30.129
His assets were seized by CAB.

906
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:52.735
Everyone in the Republic of Ireland
remembers where they were

907
01:30:52.819 --> 01:30:58.783
when they heard that Veronica Guerin
had been murdered on the Naas Road.
