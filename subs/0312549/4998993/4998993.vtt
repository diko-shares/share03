1
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.991
Father, look kindly on your children
who put their trust in you.

2
00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:35.619
Bless them and keep them from all harm.

3
00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:39.206
Strengthen them against
the attacks of the devil.

4
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.503
May they never offend you,
but seek to love you in all they do.

5
00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:50.509
May Almighty God bless you,
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

6
00:00:50.593 --> 00:00:54.388
The Mass has ended.
Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

7
00:00:54.472 --> 00:00:57.391
Thanks be to God.

8
00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:07.860
Good morning, Mary. How are you?

9
00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:11.822
Good morning, Elizabeth. How are you?

10
00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:13.783
Good morning, Bernie.

11
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:17.244
Father, would you say a prayer
to Our Lady for an intervention?

12
00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:19.455
- What's wrong? Is someone sick?
- No.

13
00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:23.334
I just want us to pray for my daughter
to lose her driving licence.

14
00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:28.339
Case number 37422: Veronica Guerin.

15
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.177
Almost 1200 parking tickets.

16
00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:37.556
March 10th, speeding ticket.

17
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.017
108 miles per hour.

18
00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:45.815
Just last month another speeding ticket
for driving at 104 miles per hour.

19
00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:50.528
Well, now, I think that shows
some improvement by my client, Judge.

20
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:54.240
I'll alert mothers it's safe
to let their children back on the streets.

21
00:01:54.323 --> 00:02:00.496
I... I deserve to lose this case, Judge.
That's fair enough, you know.

22
00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.085
But if I can't drive, I can't do my job.
I'm a journalist with the Sunday Independent.

23
00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:11.966
We all know who you are, Miss Guerin.
That does not grant you immunity.

24
00:02:26.272 --> 00:02:32.778
This is Bernie Guerin. I can't take your call
at the moment. Please leave a message.

25
00:02:33.404 --> 00:02:37.241
Mum, I'm driving!
Can you believe it? He let me off.

26
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:40.744
He actually let me off.
I love you, Mum. Talk to you.

27
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:44.123
Ah, no! You're having me on.

28
00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:47.918
No, I swear to God. Just a £100 fine
and a warning. I'm behind the wheel again.

29
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.963
- It's your ma, the criminal.
- Hi, Ma.

30
00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:55.009
Well, I hope you've learned a lesson
and reformed your ways, young lady.

31
00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:59.221
- Hey, you're not speeding now, are you?
- No, of course I'm not.

32
00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:01.390
Well, maybe a little.

33
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.102
What did you say to that daft judge?

34
00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:07.521
I told him I was guilty as sin.

35
00:03:07.605 --> 00:03:11.525
And he let you off?
Pleads a great case for judicial reform.

36
00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.529
Yeah. Another repeat offender
returned to decent society.

37
00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:20.492
This is Garda detective Chris Mulligan.
Please leave a message.

38
00:03:21.535 --> 00:03:25.915
You didn't get me this time, Chris.
Still got the wheels.

39
00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:30.002
I was fined - you're gonna love this -
100 quid. Can you believe it?

40
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:34.298
You owe me lunch. You said wherever
I want, and I'm expensive, don't forget.

41
00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.806
Veronica?

42
00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:45.059
Veronica?

43
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.656
The fucking eagle has landed.

44
00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:50.309
How are you, boss?

45
00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:48.325
Push off, you little scum.

46
00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.622
Come on, get your money ready. £5.

47
00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.199
How are you?

48
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:16.246
The name's Veronica.
I write for the Sunday Independent.

49
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.669
May I ask you some questions?
D'you mind?

50
00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:28.091
How much d'you pay for one of those?

51
00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:33.847
A few quid. Anyway, it's cheaper
to rent someone else's needle.

52
00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:35.933
What about the score?

53
00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:39.853
- First one's free.
- Well, I heard £5.

54
00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:48.987
- Where d'you get the cash for all this?
- I just say to some broad like you:

55
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:53.825
"Give me your money
or I'll inject you with AIDS."

56
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:59.373
- How old are you?
- What's it to you?

57
00:09:00.165 --> 00:09:03.752
I'm writing a piece for the paper.
I wanna know where you get the gear.

58
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:09.383
I'll do your work for you.
Come back when you got some money.

59
00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:20.519
- Fatso, don't be spending that on food.
- I'll check it later.

60
00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:24.314
- Lost, are we?
- Who might you be?

61
00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:28.277
- Neighbourhood watch.
- Yeah, well, better keep an eye out.

62
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.905
I hear there's some dodgy scangers about.

63
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.039
I fucking swear to God...

64
00:10:05.022 --> 00:10:08.025
Ah, Jamey, Jamey, Jamey, Jamey.

65
00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.153
You're an awful man, do you know that?

66
00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:15.574
What'd you have to go and shoot
your mouth off to the Gards about me for?

67
00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:19.453
Did you think I wouldn't
find out it was you?

68
00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:24.207
You know, I was thinking about killing you.

69
00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:30.672
And then I thought to myself,
people get killed every day,

70
00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:33.133
and nobody gives a shite.

71
00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.803
So I've decided
I'm going to have to hurt you a bit.

72
00:10:38.013 --> 00:10:41.475
Actually,
I'm going to hurt you an awful lot.

73
00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:46.813
But the good news is that I'm going to
do you meself. Oh, yeah. Personally.

74
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:49.399
I mean, you don't want people thinking,

75
00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:53.236
just because I got me name
in the papers and all that,

76
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:59.743
that Martin Cahill is too posh to do
his own dirty work, now, do you, huh?

77
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.753
For fuck's sake...

78
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:12.589
Take the gag out of his mouth.

79
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:18.428
Let the little scumbag squeal.
It's what he's good at, isn't it? Squeal!

80
00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.954
Please...

81
00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.689
- I'm sorry!
- How are you?

82
00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:15.318
- You made lunch. Aren't you great?
- I must be.

83
00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:19.364
- Hi.
- Hi, Jimmy.

84
00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:22.576
Off to a big news story, are we?

85
00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:26.538
Come on, Ronnie. Give us a scoop.
Who's the scumbag of the week?

86
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:30.500
Go and buy the paper, little brother.
You ready for me?

87
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:34.713
- Did I say something?
- Don't look at me. She's your sister.

88
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.599
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

89
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:49.728
Night. Night, darling.
I'm in the other room if you need me.

90
00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:52.147
OK.

91
00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.819
He won't have any trouble sleeping tonight.

92
00:12:57.903 --> 00:13:00.614
That's cos you wore him out
on the football pitch.

93
00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.741
Yeah.

94
00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:06.703
- What's up?
- Nothing.

95
00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:11.082
Nothing or something?

96
00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:13.627
It's bollocks, what I'm writing.

97
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.131
- Give yourself a bit of credit for a change.
- Whatever. So it's half-decent bollocks.

98
00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:21.176
It's light. It's human interest.

99
00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.345
It's bollocks.

100
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:27.724
What a state, on the street.
There were needles everywhere.

101
00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:30.769
- Right where the kids were playing.
- Jesus.

102
00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:36.483
You should have seen these wankers.
Standing there with their new Mercedes.

103
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:40.403
How many £5 hits of dope do you need
to shift in order to buy a new Mercedes?

104
00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:43.782
Do the math. How many kids is that?

105
00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:50.956
Nobody's writing about it. Nobody cares.

106
00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.042
Somebody needs
to get after these bastards.

107
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:59.798
They're making megabucks.
That's what I should be writing about.

108
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.678
That wouldn't be bollocks.

109
00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:10.767
The pushers are using the underage kids
to do their business.

110
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:14.980
They know the Gards won't touch the kids.
Everyone knows what goes on here.

111
00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:19.276
Eight kids from this block alone
died from drugs last year. Eight.

112
00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:22.487
All of them under 15.
Four of them were me sister Iris's kids.

113
00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:23.947
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

114
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.117
TDs, Gards, close their eyes,
call it a family problem.

115
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.703
But for some families
these kids are dead already.

116
00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:34.416
So we formed Concerned Parents
Against Drugs, made it our problem.

117
00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.668
I'd appreciate it if you'd write about us.

118
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.587
- How often do you march?
- Once a week.

119
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.631
- It's quite a commitment.
- It's quite a problem.

120
00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.634
Hey. Do you remember me?

121
00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:52.058
- Were those Cahill's lads in the van?
- What van?

122
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:55.478
She can help, Timmy.

123
00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:58.607
You know, Martin Cahill. The General.

124
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.859
You know him?

125
00:15:01.776 --> 00:15:04.279
What's your cut?

126
00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:11.828
- I'd better go. I can't be seen with yous.
- Let us help you, Timmy.

127
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.290
I can find you a good place
to stay tonight. Tomorrow...

128
00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:17.751
Do yous wanna have sex with me?

129
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.212
I'm not expensive.

130
00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.472
- The bill, please.
- He nicked your wallet.

131
00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:33.099
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

132
00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:34.893
- When do we want them?
- Now!

133
00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:36.686
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

134
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.564
- When do you want them?
- Now!

135
00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:41.983
Are these marches always this small?

136
00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:44.986
Hopefully, with your help,
the word'll get out to more people.

137
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.322
Yeah, hopefully.

138
00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:50.075
I'll make sure it does.

139
00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:58.917
- Get out, Mullen!
- You bastard, Tommy Mullen!

140
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:04.673
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

141
00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.132
- When do we want them?
- Now!

142
00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:07.926
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!

143
00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.552
- When do we want them?
- Now!

144
00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.430
- Pusher, pusher, pusher!
- Out, out, out!

145
00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:30.073
Look who's got hisself a new girlfriend.

146
00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:37.831
- We'll see you there, then, John.
- Yeah, go on ahead.

147
00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:42.419
- What the hell do you want?
- Is that any way to talk to a lady?

148
00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.088
Ladies don't go calling
on gentleman unannounced.

149
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.257
So we're a gentleman now, are we?

150
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.844
Where's your manners?
You didn't introduce me to your friends.

151
00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.972
- If that's what you're after.
- You closing up early?

152
00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.766
One of the benefits of being self-employed.

153
00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:02.522
You're amazing, John.
No, really, you're a model of... profitability.

154
00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:06.735
How to succeed in business
without any customers.

155
00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:08.737
- I do well enough.
- Yeah, well...

156
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.323
There must be a few bob
in those brothels there on Rathgar Road.

157
00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.076
What they worth now, John?

158
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.873
- You're a dangerous little bitch.
- Ah, well. Do my best. Buy us a drink?

159
00:17:19.956 --> 00:17:25.628
It's the benefit of being self-employed,
John. You are your own boss, aren't you?

160
00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:30.175
You're way off the mark. Martin Cahill
isn't into the drugs. Neither am I.

161
00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.177
You sure?

162
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.930
We're just ordinary, decent criminals.

163
00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:39.392
If you're not going to take my word for it,
why don't you ask Martin?

164
00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:45.106
- He's very fond of the ladies.
- Yeah, exactly. So set it up for me.

165
00:17:45.899 --> 00:17:48.818
Why are you chasing the drugs?
You should be after the pubs.

166
00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:52.447
- They do more damage than the drugs.
- Yeah, right.

167
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.782
Yeah?

168
00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:57.243
No. I tried that. It was a dead end.

169
00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.037
Call you back? Grand.

170
00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:02.916
So how many guys
are you working for stories at once?

171
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.920
A less generous person
might say you were ungrateful

172
00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.339
for what I gave you already.

173
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:13.968
Stealing old paintings, kidnapping bankers'
families. You're above that now, are you?

174
00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:16.846
I got you famous with those stories.

175
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.391
Yeah, you feed me superficial crap.

176
00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:23.853
- I make you look good.
- Great picture.

177
00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:28.817
Come on. I need your help to get to Cahill.
Write me a reference.

178
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.402
I'm late for an appointment.

179
00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:36.282
Word of advice.
Stay away from Martin Cahill.

180
00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:47.585
Sorry to disturb you.

181
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:52.298
Are you Mrs Cahill? Frances Cahill?

182
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.096
Right.

183
00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:14.988
Are you Frances Cahill?

184
00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:17.657
- I am.
- Hi. I'm Veronica.

185
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.786
- I'm a friend of John Traynor's.
- I know who you are.

186
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.582
Is your husband home?
I just want to ask him a favour.

187
00:19:25.665 --> 00:19:29.752
Martin Cahill doesn't
do favours for journalists.

188
00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.504
So piss off.

189
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:35.717
There's a rumour going about he's putting
drugs on the street. You got any comment?

190
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.138
I know he nailed a tout to the floor of a
flat the other day. Was it drug-related?

191
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:44.017
Look, I just want a brief comment.
Off the record.

192
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.977
I'll be out of your...

193
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.980
Mr Cahill! You couldn't
do me a favour, could you?

194
00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:52.942
I need the names of those kids
who are selling drugs for you.

195
00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:57.864
And I'll do you a favour. I won't write
what people are saying about you.

196
00:19:57.947 --> 00:20:01.784
You know, that you're having kids
with your wife's sisters.

197
00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.787
There's me number. Give me a call.

198
00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.707
Cheers.

199
00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.593
So, what can I do for you, veronica?

200
00:20:18.676 --> 00:20:20.887
How could you lose a body?

201
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.725
- That's just downright careless.
- You find some, you lose some.

202
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:28.102
It'll turn up. Those bodies always do.

203
00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:30.271
So you gonna join those crying foul?

204
00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:33.524
"More Garda incompetence.
Is this why we pay our taxes?"

205
00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:38.780
Some might say it's incompetent, but you
could say it's that you're understaffed.

206
00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:45.036
Your hands are tied. You couldn't maintain
24-hour surveillance on that murder site.

207
00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:49.958
People should know that.
I mean, I think someone should write that.

208
00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:54.128
And if someone did write that,
what would that someone want in return?

209
00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:59.133
I talked to the couple you detained
after the weekend in Amsterdam.

210
00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:04.555
Held for 48 hours cos they bought
nothing there but a box of condoms.

211
00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:09.978
How does it feel to wait around for a mule
to shite out a condom full of drugs?

212
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:14.565
You and I both know that the courier's
the lowest man in the organisation.

213
00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:19.028
Somewhere some Mr Big is sitting there,
laughing at you and your stool sample.

214
00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:23.074
You can't touch him. I want -
we both want - to get Mr Untouchable.

215
00:21:23.157 --> 00:21:25.243
What are you gonna do when you get him?

216
00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:28.955
Your paper's so scared
that some big criminal is gonna sue them,

217
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:31.374
they employ more lawyers than journalists.

218
00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:35.628
Well, I mean,
there's more than 300,000 people.

219
00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:39.674
I don't want to blow my own trumpet,
but they know Martin Cahill's the General

220
00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:42.969
because, you know,
of what I write in the Sunday Independent.

221
00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:47.348
- At least they know what he's up to.
- Great, for your readers.

222
00:21:47.432 --> 00:21:49.851
But does it help me
put him behind bars, does it?

223
00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:53.021
We're on the same side, Chris.

224
00:21:53.104 --> 00:21:56.232
Now, I trained as an accountant, right?

225
00:21:56.274 --> 00:22:01.279
If I could have a look at these files,
then I could go after those other wankers.

226
00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:03.781
Put some pressure on them.

227
00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:05.950
Come on.

228
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:08.661
Go on.

229
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:18.463
Look, I've got some more packing to do.
I'll be back in an hour or so.

230
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:22.133
Looking forward to reading
someone's column on Sunday.

231
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.228
"For the Coach every day is lotto day."

232
00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:40.693
"What others might earn in a decade,
he can conjure up in an afternoon."

233
00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:45.656
"His Swiss scam was such a stroke,
a child of his remarkable ingenuity."

234
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.326
"The fruits of a complex fraud..."

235
00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:50.620
- The Coach, boss.
- What?

236
00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:57.502
Never knew you were
such a horse lover, John.

237
00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:04.467
- What took you so long?
- The traffic.

238
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.179
Nothing to do with that woman
who writes for the Sunday Indo?

239
00:23:08.262 --> 00:23:11.557
- Did the boys say something?
- That's not the question, Johnny.

240
00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:14.102
The question is:
what did you say to that woman?

241
00:23:14.185 --> 00:23:16.270
Nothing important.

242
00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:20.024
She fancies me, so I humour her.

243
00:23:20.108 --> 00:23:24.654
You know why I'm successful, Johnny?
I lead a quiet life.

244
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:28.950
Nobody knows what I'm doing,
and that's very good for business.

245
00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:34.789
When you talk to that bitch and when she
writes about you, you feel like a movie star.

246
00:23:34.872 --> 00:23:39.669
Don't think she doesn't know
how to use that, because she does.

247
00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:44.882
You're not as smart as you think you are.
That makes you a liability.

248
00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:52.348
Remember this. If that bitch
ever mentions my name, you pay.

249
00:23:58.646 --> 00:24:00.982
You like playing the gangster, do you?

250
00:24:01.065 --> 00:24:06.070
Do you? It makes you feel like a big man.
Does it make you feel like a big man?

251
00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:11.200
How does it feel now?
Heap of shite! You heap of shite!

252
00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:13.744
- John, please...
- You bunch of eejits.

253
00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:19.208
Who's the fucking genius
messing with the gun around my horses?

254
00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:23.963
You don't insult me boys, Gerry.
You leave that to me.

255
00:24:24.046 --> 00:24:27.675
Unless you want
some of the same yourself.

256
00:24:31.888 --> 00:24:35.850
Word of advice.
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

257
00:24:37.435 --> 00:24:39.896
I called you here
cos we've got a debt to settle.

258
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.230
What debt?

259
00:24:41.314 --> 00:24:45.526
Your man Martin Cahill thinks
over half a million quid is owed him.

260
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.447
I got him to loan us that money to start up
the operation. If he wants it back...

261
00:24:49.572 --> 00:24:52.658
As far as I'm concerned
that money keeps moving forward.

262
00:24:52.742 --> 00:24:58.039
He lent you the money when you were just
out of prison. Now he's down on his luck.

263
00:24:58.122 --> 00:25:01.417
He can't shift the paintings
from the last job. They're too hot.

264
00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:04.212
- Why don't you just pay him?
- No, no. You don't get it.

265
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:08.466
When a scumbag like Cahill is down
on his luck, you kick him in the bollocks.

266
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:12.053
Wouldn't try that with Martin Cahill.

267
00:25:12.136 --> 00:25:14.931
Whose side are you on, Coach?

268
00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:19.477
I just think we should make payment.

269
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.023
Don't you worry about it.
We're gonna make payment.

270
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:16.659
Jesus!

271
00:26:43.853 --> 00:26:46.105
Are you people fucking insane?

272
00:26:47.315 --> 00:26:50.192
For a few hundred grand,
you've murdered all of us.

273
00:26:50.276 --> 00:26:52.153
I don't like your tone, Coach.

274
00:26:52.236 --> 00:26:54.322
Maybe the Gards
don't know what you did

275
00:26:54.405 --> 00:26:56.574
but if the rest of the Cahill mob find out,

276
00:26:56.699 --> 00:27:01.329
they'll kill yous
and everyone you did business with.

277
00:27:01.412 --> 00:27:05.666
The IRA has claimed responsibility
for the murder of Martin Cahill.

278
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:11.130
We are now doing everything in our power
to apprehend and identify the gunmen.

279
00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:13.299
At the moment,
no progress has been made.

280
00:27:13.382 --> 00:27:16.052
This isn't the first execution
we've seen all year.

281
00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:18.429
What progress has been
made on other cases?

282
00:27:18.512 --> 00:27:21.390
I cannot comment
on any other investigation at this time.

283
00:27:21.474 --> 00:27:24.560
Why is progress never made
on any cases involving the IRA?

284
00:27:24.602 --> 00:27:30.441
Cahill's family has stated that the General -
and I quote - "was not killed by the IRA,

285
00:27:30.524 --> 00:27:34.278
but because someone saw how much
money he made and wanted to take over."

286
00:27:34.362 --> 00:27:37.740
In your opinion,
could the murder be drug-related?

287
00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:42.370
- You can't believe everything you hear.
- Neither can you, Des.

288
00:27:51.796 --> 00:27:57.009
Look, veronica, every journalist
sees a vast conspiracy in everything.

289
00:27:57.093 --> 00:28:01.305
We haven't a fucking clue about anything.
We just don't know who killed Cahill.

290
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:06.644
Yeah, and you don't care, right? As long as
they kill each other, it's easier for all of you.

291
00:28:08.312 --> 00:28:12.566
Here. Let's sort out the
petty criminals first.

292
00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:19.573
Those who loved Martin Cahill
feel a deep sense of loss and pain.

293
00:28:21.325 --> 00:28:23.994
Violence can only lead to death,

294
00:28:25.538 --> 00:28:30.167
because it's the way of hatred,
fear and revenge.

295
00:28:31.043 --> 00:28:34.630
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed
be thy name, thy kingdom come...

296
00:28:34.672 --> 00:28:38.676
Nothing like a funeral
to bring out the competition, is there?

297
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:43.639
Look at Gerry Hutch there, all tearful.
Or should I say the Monk?

298
00:28:43.681 --> 00:28:46.809
He's not bad-looking, for a monk.

299
00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:49.687
The thing about monks,
though, is they're celibate.

300
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:51.856
Supposedly.

301
00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:56.569
See those two there?
They're dealers, right?

302
00:28:56.652 --> 00:29:00.406
Oh, yeah.
Fatso Mitchell and Tommy Mullen.

303
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.329
- Cahill wasn't running drugs.
- No?

304
00:29:07.413 --> 00:29:13.127
I followed the money and it turns out
your man was absolutely broke.

305
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.963
- The family had to borrow 10,000 for this.
- Really?

306
00:29:16.046 --> 00:29:19.216
- Didn't have the cash to run drugs.
- For fuck's sakes.

307
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.345
Will you look? The north side rivals
to pay their respects.

308
00:29:24.847 --> 00:29:27.433
That's Brian Meehan there.

309
00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:31.312
- The blond one?
- Yeah. Nasty little fucker.

310
00:29:31.395 --> 00:29:35.983
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

311
00:29:36.066 --> 00:29:39.487
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.

312
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.906
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

313
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:48.746
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

314
00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:55.169
Yeah?

315
00:29:55.252 --> 00:30:01.091
- The IRA didn't act alone.
- Tell me something I don't know.

316
00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:05.971
- Where are you?
- Gerry Hutch ordered the hit on Cahill.

317
00:30:06.847 --> 00:30:10.351
Hutch? Jesus, are you sure, now?

318
00:30:11.101 --> 00:30:13.062
I was there.

319
00:30:25.324 --> 00:30:27.409
She bought it.

320
00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:31.205
Boohoo!

321
00:30:33.249 --> 00:30:34.959
Boohoo!

322
00:30:39.296 --> 00:30:42.591
Get out of here now
or I'll put you out of your misery.

323
00:30:42.675 --> 00:30:44.969
OK. Let's bring him in.

324
00:30:53.894 --> 00:30:57.356
Right, strip him and search him.

325
00:30:57.439 --> 00:31:03.195
I'll get you. Your wife, your kids.
You think you're the big fella now?

326
00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:07.199
You'll not be so big
the next time you meet me with a bally on.

327
00:31:07.283 --> 00:31:11.954
Yeah? I'm trembling. We can do this
the hard way or the easy way. Your choice.

328
00:31:12.037 --> 00:31:15.082
Let's do it the hard way, huh?

329
00:31:15.165 --> 00:31:18.335
Do you like men with big cocks, do you?
D'you want that, do you?

330
00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:22.590
Is she a lesbian, is she?
You fancy me arse, don't you? You pervert.

331
00:31:22.673 --> 00:31:27.511
All right. Get your designer gear back on
and get the fuck out of my sight.

332
00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:31.056
There's over £600 there.
You can keep that.

333
00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.143
Yous fuckers need it more than I do.

334
00:31:34.935 --> 00:31:38.939
Bunch of fucking eejits,
working and paying taxes.

335
00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:43.569
D'you know what? I make more in a week
than yous fuckers earn in a month. Here.

336
00:31:43.652 --> 00:31:46.697
That's more than you earn in a year.

337
00:31:47.364 --> 00:31:50.951
Thanks. See you, guys. All the best.

338
00:31:51.035 --> 00:31:53.120
See you soon, Brian.

339
00:32:00.294 --> 00:32:04.131
I always like to go
shopping after a funeral.

340
00:32:07.968 --> 00:32:10.679
- What are you doing here?
- It's looking bad for you.

341
00:32:10.763 --> 00:32:14.516
- People say you ordered the hit on Cahill.
- People can say what they like.

342
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.561
I was out of the country at the time.

343
00:32:17.645 --> 00:32:23.233
Is that your response, Mr Hutch?
Or should I call you the Monk?

344
00:32:23.317 --> 00:32:26.320
You're invading my privacy
and the privacy of my family.

345
00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:31.283
So if you don't get the fuck off my property,
I'm gonna sue you and your fucking paper.

346
00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:33.452
Now fuck off!

347
00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:37.915
Can I quote you on that?

348
00:32:44.171 --> 00:32:46.256
I can't talk to anyone right now.

349
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.259
It's Tony Gregory.
He's the MP for Dublin Central.

350
00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:53.889
I know who he is. I still can't talk to him.
Tell him to call back later.

351
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:57.393
- You can tell him yourself.
- Hiya, Tony.

352
00:32:57.476 --> 00:32:59.687
What is this shite?

353
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.398
It's Ireland's finest newspaper, Tony.

354
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:06.026
"Dublin city is currently
like a tinderbox just waiting to explode."

355
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:10.155
- This sounds like self-fulfilling prophecy.
- It's a source quote.

356
00:33:10.239 --> 00:33:12.199
It's not me editorialising.

357
00:33:12.282 --> 00:33:15.160
No north inner-city gang
was involved in Cahill's murder.

358
00:33:15.244 --> 00:33:18.789
The gardai have photos of these gangs
and no witnesses identified them.

359
00:33:18.872 --> 00:33:21.417
The only reason there isn't
a blood bath right now

360
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.086
is because the Cahills
didn't buy your story.

361
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:28.257
Now, as far as I am concerned,
this woman is reckless and inflammatory.

362
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.300
She treats rumour as fact.

363
00:33:30.384 --> 00:33:33.345
And your newspaper is irresponsible
for publishing it.

364
00:33:33.429 --> 00:33:38.559
Now, I expect to read my response
over my breakfast next Sunday.

365
00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.647
- I did nothing wrong.
- I know. Did you corroborate your facts?

366
00:33:43.731 --> 00:33:47.735
I was told by a source who's never
been wrong before. I didn't name Hutch.

367
00:33:47.818 --> 00:33:51.864
I didn't even call him the Monk. I put it
to him. He said he was out of the country.

368
00:33:51.947 --> 00:33:55.284
He said he would sue us,
but he didn't deny it.

369
00:33:55.367 --> 00:33:58.620
- We know that.
- And the lawyers approved it, Aengus.

370
00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:03.000
We don't doubt you, Veronica. It's Gregory.
He's a Member of Parliament for the area.

371
00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:06.295
- He wants to have his say.
- I don't give a shite about that.

372
00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:08.964
What about the source?
He won't go on record?

373
00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:13.218
Course he won't. He's a criminal.
Jesus, this is like being a cop.

374
00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:18.474
Worse. You can't get a search warrant or
a wiretap but you have to prove everything.

375
00:34:18.557 --> 00:34:23.353
Yes. And you want to check
how reliable that source of yours is.

376
00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:32.321
Is Traynor about?

377
00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:51.965
- Jesus!
- Oh, sorry, John. Just a quick question.

378
00:34:52.049 --> 00:34:56.637
You're not aiming to start a gang war,
are you, between the Cahills and Hutch?

379
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.890
- Jesus. She's famous.
- Shut up, you.

380
00:34:59.973 --> 00:35:04.144
I have a feeling you've been feeding me
a line of shite about the Monk.

381
00:35:04.228 --> 00:35:05.771
What are you talking about?

382
00:35:05.854 --> 00:35:10.275
Get the south and north side gangs to kill
each other so someone else can take over.

383
00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:14.196
You're talking out of your arse.
Get outta here. Unless you wanna join in.

384
00:35:14.279 --> 00:35:17.366
You told me you were there, John.

385
00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:21.620
- I've done you a lot of favours.
- I'm the one doing the favours.

386
00:35:21.703 --> 00:35:25.666
I've done you the favours!
Don't forget that.

387
00:35:25.749 --> 00:35:29.378
I tell you what I know.
I don't tell you what to do with it.

388
00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:32.464
You come in here calling me a fucking liar!

389
00:35:32.548 --> 00:35:35.050
That's a bit of an
overreaction there, John.

390
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:49.231
- Why don't you come and have a pint?
- Too many journalists for me.

391
00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:52.860
You can't join a club
if you ignore the members, Veronica.

392
00:35:52.943 --> 00:35:56.071
I know what they say about me:
no journalistic experience,

393
00:35:56.113 --> 00:36:00.367
I'm exaggerating the drug problem,
my sources are unreliable, I can't spell.

394
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.246
- Pretty accurate.
- I know I'm no great writer.

395
00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:07.541
Well, I think you're a poet, Veronica.

396
00:36:11.295 --> 00:36:13.380
Go on. Go on, Cantona!

397
00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:17.301
That's poetry.

398
00:36:18.135 --> 00:36:20.596
- What's the score?
- Nothing-nothing.

399
00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:25.934
Cantona's a fucking vacuum cleaner today,
man. It's unreal.

400
00:36:27.603 --> 00:36:30.772
He's what you call a striker.
Number seven. Watch him.

401
00:36:30.856 --> 00:36:33.233
A striker? What did you say his name was?

402
00:36:33.317 --> 00:36:35.611
Eric Cantona.

403
00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:38.822
Born 26th May 1966.
Led Man United to six cups.

404
00:36:38.906 --> 00:36:41.825
Premier League footballer
of the year in '89. Is that him?

405
00:36:41.909 --> 00:36:45.537
Well, fuck me pink. I think it is, yeah.
Fair play to you.

406
00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:48.415
- I met him.
- You met Eric Cantona?

407
00:36:48.498 --> 00:36:51.501
- What did he say to you?
- Doesn't matter. He's a genius.

408
00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:54.171
He is a fucking genius, man. He's deadly.

409
00:36:56.673 --> 00:37:01.553
Look at that.
I bet you any money the Monk done that.

410
00:37:02.346 --> 00:37:07.893
Do you fancy going for a pint? There's a
great little pub down the road. Very quiet.

411
00:37:07.976 --> 00:37:11.605
That's almost three million quid.

412
00:37:11.688 --> 00:37:14.149
Where would you hide three million quid?

413
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:16.860
How could you find any fun
in hiding three million?

414
00:37:16.944 --> 00:37:20.197
Wouldn't you be out on the town
spending it like a mad thing?

415
00:37:20.322 --> 00:37:23.200
Yeah. That's exactly right.

416
00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:27.329
- Good night. Thanks.
- So no pint, now?

417
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:30.457
Not a chance?

418
00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:42.052
- Well done on the Brinks job, Gerry!
- What the fuck you doing following me?

419
00:37:42.135 --> 00:37:45.847
- I'm gonna write about it.
- I don't give a bollocks what you write.

420
00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:49.851
- What are you doing with the money?
- It's none of your business what I do.

421
00:37:49.935 --> 00:37:51.561
There you go.

422
00:37:51.645 --> 00:37:54.064
You know, I've forgotten my manners.

423
00:37:54.147 --> 00:37:58.944
You've been to my home.
Maybe it's about fucking time I visit yours.

424
00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:02.739
- Straight ahead, sir.
- Thanks. I'll see you again.

425
00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:07.661
- Night, Ma.
- Night, love.

426
00:38:07.744 --> 00:38:10.664
- What are you reading, Ma?
- Just some of me notes.

427
00:38:10.747 --> 00:38:14.876
- On the bad guys?
- No. There's just one bad guy I'm after.

428
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.132
It's the one who's up way past his bedtime.
Now, let's go.

429
00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:25.012
You're getting much too big for
your old ma. I'll have to read you a story.

430
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.765
Jesus.

431
00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:32.019
What the hell was that?

432
00:38:32.102 --> 00:38:34.604
- Stay there.
- All right.

433
00:39:01.423 --> 00:39:04.301
That's great. Thank you.

434
00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:14.686
Ronnie. We're all nervous.

435
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.897
Ma's nervous, I'm nervous.

436
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.900
Even Graham.
He just won't say anything about it.

437
00:39:19.983 --> 00:39:22.110
Everyone knows
it's no use talking to you.

438
00:39:22.194 --> 00:39:26.073
Jimmy, those people issue death threats
if their laundry's folded wrong.

439
00:39:26.156 --> 00:39:28.867
Ma! Ma, where did you put the candles?

440
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:31.620
They're on top of the bread box!

441
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:35.624
Ah, right.
Besides, it's not the first.

442
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:39.503
You remember those religious fanatics
after the Bishop Casey story.

443
00:39:39.586 --> 00:39:42.089
There's always someone.
You get used to them.

444
00:39:42.172 --> 00:39:46.551
No, Ronnie, you get used to cold water,
not bullets. This is madness.

445
00:39:46.635 --> 00:39:50.347
You'd do the same. If you saw those kids
on the street, you would do the same.

446
00:39:50.472 --> 00:39:54.309
- Not if there was people shooting at me.
- Ma, look!

447
00:39:54.893 --> 00:39:59.064
- Cathal, that's great! Who gave you that?
- You and Dad.

448
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:02.067
Yeah.

449
00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:07.864
I am listening, actually. Whoever did it
made sure I was not in the room.

450
00:40:09.616 --> 00:40:12.327
Could you do this? You're better at it.

451
00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:15.497
- There's nothing to worry about.
- Nothing to worry about?

452
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:20.127
I'm the only Guerin in the phone book.
Who do you think they'll come after next?

453
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:23.505
Don't flatter yourself, little brother.

454
00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:26.633
Are you going to dance on this
or are you gonna go fast on it?

455
00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:30.679
- Here, give someone else a go.
- Give me a turn!

456
00:41:09.092 --> 00:41:11.511
Are you coming to bed?

457
00:41:12.429 --> 00:41:15.056
- What?
- I know you can hear me. Coming to bed?

458
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.975
I'll be along in a minute.

459
00:41:18.894 --> 00:41:21.605
Fine. Suit yourself.

460
00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:29.905
Turn it down. Turn it down!

461
00:41:31.239 --> 00:41:35.744
Come on. I love it. I love my work.

462
00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:39.372
I'm finally doing something
that can make a difference.

463
00:41:39.456 --> 00:41:42.167
What am I gonna do with you?

464
00:41:42.959 --> 00:41:44.753
- Oh, come on.
- No.

465
00:41:56.806 --> 00:41:59.017
OK.

466
00:42:05.065 --> 00:42:07.150
Come on, man.

467
00:42:08.068 --> 00:42:11.112
Come on. Good boy!

468
00:42:18.161 --> 00:42:20.247
Did we wake you up?

469
00:42:26.086 --> 00:42:31.007
What can I say?
I don't think Gerry Hutch is into drugs.

470
00:42:31.091 --> 00:42:34.302
The Brinks heist, probably.
But drugs is just not his scene.

471
00:42:34.386 --> 00:42:37.639
I understand, but I've been
tracking his movements.

472
00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:41.518
I just need to source the drugs.
The connection's easy. I need your help.

473
00:42:41.643 --> 00:42:46.523
- I need you to stop coming to my office.
- He's got the money.

474
00:42:46.606 --> 00:42:50.235
We're talking about a fella
with no visible source of income

475
00:42:50.318 --> 00:42:53.029
who paid tax on £2 million last year.

476
00:42:53.113 --> 00:42:56.032
It's laundered
through the government's tax amnesty.

477
00:42:56.116 --> 00:43:00.328
- He's got too much money not to be into it.
- In your esteemed journalistic opinion.

478
00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:04.332
I know you seized shipments from Cork.
It's coming from somewhere. Where?

479
00:43:04.416 --> 00:43:08.461
We've impounded drugs from
Liverpool, Scotland, Amsterdam, Pakistan.

480
00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:13.174
You're not the only one trying here, and
Hutch isn't the only one with dirty money.

481
00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:16.261
- Who else you got?
- I could name you a dozen.

482
00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:19.514
Here's the latest candidate,
just in from Interpol.

483
00:43:19.556 --> 00:43:22.183
John Gilligan, one year
out of Portlaoise Prison.

484
00:43:22.267 --> 00:43:24.686
Can you tell me
how this Ballyfermot lowlife

485
00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:29.649
has £300,000 to launder in an Amsterdam
casino? You're the star journalist.

486
00:43:29.733 --> 00:43:31.943
Gilligan. Certainly keeps a low profile.

487
00:43:32.027 --> 00:43:33.194
Yeah?

488
00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:35.905
Hi, Aengus. Yeah, can you hold?

489
00:43:35.989 --> 00:43:37.866
- Can I...?
- Go on. It's a copy.

490
00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:39.909
- Great.
- Just go.

491
00:43:39.993 --> 00:43:42.078
I owe you lunch.

492
00:43:43.747 --> 00:43:46.791
No, run the Brinks story.
Just hold off on the drugs claim.

493
00:43:46.875 --> 00:43:50.337
What for? This stuff you sent is great.

494
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.757
Just give me 24 hours.
I got a tip. This could be big.

495
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.845
- I'm trusting you on this one, Veronica.
- Oh, aren't you great!

496
00:44:09.606 --> 00:44:12.150
Nice tan there, John!

497
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.237
Hope there's no hard feelings between us.

498
00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:22.035
I'm not one to take a bullet
through my window personally.

499
00:44:22.118 --> 00:44:24.537
Get lost.

500
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:27.749
I told you to be careful
with the likes of Gerry Hutch.

501
00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:32.337
But you didn't tell me
about a fella named Gilligan.

502
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.421
Who?

503
00:44:33.505 --> 00:44:36.341
You provided him with a car
when he got out of prison.

504
00:44:36.424 --> 00:44:39.052
John Gilligan. Do you want me to spell it?

505
00:44:39.135 --> 00:44:42.639
I run a bleedin' garage.
I provide loads of cars to people.

506
00:44:42.722 --> 00:44:45.600
Hardly gonna remember
every one of them, now, am I?

507
00:44:45.642 --> 00:44:50.355
- Is that him there?
- Why should I give a shite?

508
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:55.568
No reason, really. Just the fella behind
the security guard looks a lot like you.

509
00:44:56.945 --> 00:45:00.532
- Now, there's a coincidence.
- Where's his money coming from?

510
00:45:00.615 --> 00:45:02.992
Is he providing
hash and heroin to Mitchell?

511
00:45:03.076 --> 00:45:06.621
I can't help you, Veronica.
Don't know nothing about him.

512
00:45:06.663 --> 00:45:09.624
If I hear of anything,
I'll let you know, OK? Molly!

513
00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:13.878
You can keep the photo if you like.
It's a nice one of you. We got plenty.

514
00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:21.761
- You sell horses yourself?
- I do.

515
00:45:21.845 --> 00:45:26.141
- You have a number.
- I sell them on to Germany mostly.

516
00:45:26.224 --> 00:45:30.019
Myself and Geraldine are planning
to make this the largest and finest

517
00:45:30.103 --> 00:45:34.023
equestrian centre in all of Ireland.

518
00:45:34.107 --> 00:45:37.444
Well, I must say the size is impressive.

519
00:45:37.527 --> 00:45:39.404
Said the nun to the sailor.

520
00:45:40.613 --> 00:45:46.536
How about an aperitif?
Some champers, caviar? It's all imported.

521
00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:49.914
John and I have great plans for this place.

522
00:45:49.998 --> 00:45:52.083
Hang on.

523
00:45:53.418 --> 00:45:55.503
Hello?

524
00:45:55.587 --> 00:45:56.880
- Hello?
- John...

525
00:45:56.963 --> 00:46:00.467
You're breaking up there. Hello?

526
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.594
- It's Traynor.
- Johnny.

527
00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:07.015
Listen, Veronica Guerin's got hold of
a photo of us in Amsterdam.

528
00:46:07.098 --> 00:46:13.521
But, John, I swear I had nothing
to do with it. I never mentioned your name.

529
00:46:13.605 --> 00:46:15.690
But she was asking about you.

530
00:46:15.732 --> 00:46:21.988
Johnny, I told you before, if she so much
as mentions my fucking name, you pay.

531
00:46:25.158 --> 00:46:27.452
Fucking eejits!

532
00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:29.621
Fuck 'em!

533
00:46:34.918 --> 00:46:37.003
Happy Christmas!

534
00:46:39.714 --> 00:46:42.592
- Now, isn't this great?
- When's Mum coming here?

535
00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:46.471
She'll be here soon.
We'll want something stronger than that.

536
00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:54.062
Yeah? Ma, how are you?

537
00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:57.482
- Happy Christmas, Ann. You look great.
- Happy Christmas.

538
00:46:57.565 --> 00:47:01.444
- Where's your mum?
- You know her. Always going for the gold.

539
00:47:02.362 --> 00:47:04.280
All right.

540
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.242
There's someone at the door, Ma.

541
00:47:07.325 --> 00:47:10.870
My phone'll be on all night.
You can call me whenever you want.

542
00:47:10.954 --> 00:47:14.082
I love you too. OK. Bye. Bye.

543
00:47:21.756 --> 00:47:24.133
Yeah, all right, all right.

544
00:48:32.327 --> 00:48:34.829
Veronica's been shot!

545
00:48:40.877 --> 00:48:41.878
How are you?

546
00:48:42.003 --> 00:48:44.297
- How are you?
- You look gorgeous.

547
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:48.009
- Look at you. For God's sake.
- Hey, Willy.

548
00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:52.347
Can't find any sport on.
Can you believe it?

549
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:56.309
...extensive investigations
into organised crime in Dublin...

550
00:48:56.392 --> 00:48:59.979
Why do they always use
that brutal picture?

551
00:49:00.063 --> 00:49:01.898
It was a very serious incident.

552
00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:05.902
Veronica Guerin
is a very talented journalist.

553
00:49:06.027 --> 00:49:10.073
An attack like this could be seen
as an attempt to muzzle her

554
00:49:10.156 --> 00:49:15.119
because of certain publications
or articles she wrote.

555
00:49:15.203 --> 00:49:18.539
This would be connected
with last month's £3 million robbery?

556
00:49:18.623 --> 00:49:22.251
We all know who pulled that one,
don't we, Hutch? He threatened me.

557
00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:26.047
Veronica, please, stop this.
Write about fashion, about football.

558
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:30.259
Write about anything you like, but stop this.
You don't have to do it any more.

559
00:49:30.343 --> 00:49:35.473
I don't see myself covering the catwalks
or doing a gardening column, Aengus.

560
00:49:35.556 --> 00:49:38.601
You've always wanted
to write about politics.

561
00:49:38.685 --> 00:49:40.937
I am. Drugs are political.

562
00:49:41.062 --> 00:49:44.023
What if I told you
I wouldn't publish your stuff any more?

563
00:49:44.107 --> 00:49:45.942
But you never would tell me that.

564
00:49:46.067 --> 00:49:48.903
For Christ's sake,
there's no sport channel.

565
00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:51.739
- We have to go.
- What kind of hospital is this?

566
00:49:51.823 --> 00:49:54.409
Is this what we pay health insurance for?

567
00:49:54.492 --> 00:49:57.286
- Where Cathal?
- He's at your sister's with your mum.

568
00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:59.288
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

569
00:50:00.248 --> 00:50:03.042
Right. We've just got you
24-hour police protection.

570
00:50:03.126 --> 00:50:05.211
- OK?
- Grand.

571
00:50:06.295 --> 00:50:11.050
What a way to spend Christmas Eve,
looking at the poxy box.

572
00:50:11.134 --> 00:50:13.970
Mary Poppins. Gone with the Wind.

573
00:50:14.053 --> 00:50:17.849
Next thing you know
it'll be A Wonderful fucking Life.

574
00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:20.685
The doctor says it missed
the artery and the bone.

575
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:25.189
Point-blank range with a.45,
and this is all they could do.

576
00:50:25.273 --> 00:50:27.859
- Where's Cathal? How is he?
- He's fine.

577
00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:31.070
Where is he? Oh, yeah. He's with Mum.

578
00:50:31.154 --> 00:50:34.198
- Yeah. He keeps asking for you.
- Yeah?

579
00:50:36.075 --> 00:50:39.746
...shooting happened shortly after...
...investigations for the...

580
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:42.498
...warning from a crime gang.

581
00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:47.003
You gonna stop this now?

582
00:51:02.977 --> 00:51:05.271
Nan, look! It's Mum!

583
00:51:21.788 --> 00:51:24.957
- Give me the keys.
- I know what I'm doing, Graham.

584
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:29.378
- They shot me cos I'm on the right track.
- Give me the keys, please.

585
00:51:29.462 --> 00:51:32.131
- Thank you.
- Would you give me the keys?

586
00:51:32.215 --> 00:51:34.050
No.

587
00:51:34.133 --> 00:51:36.636
Look at the state of you.

588
00:51:38.471 --> 00:51:41.140
Do you think I want to do this, do you?

589
00:51:41.224 --> 00:51:44.310
I don't want to do it. I have to do it.

590
00:51:44.393 --> 00:51:48.272
You're a journalist. You write.
You let the Gards look after this.

591
00:51:48.356 --> 00:51:52.652
Oh, Graham, come off it. The Gards can't
do anything. They'll get away with it.

592
00:51:52.735 --> 00:51:55.196
- 14 shootings in 14 months.
- You're one of them.

593
00:51:55.279 --> 00:51:58.199
I know who the guys are.
Would you just give me the keys?

594
00:51:58.282 --> 00:52:01.327
No. Tough shit.

595
00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:04.080
Come on inside. Please.

596
00:52:04.205 --> 00:52:07.792
They're not getting away with it.
I'll catch a cab, then.

597
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:09.961
Oh, for God's sake.

598
00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:14.090
Ah, Jesus Christ.

599
00:52:15.091 --> 00:52:17.718
Yeah, hi. It's Veronica Guerin.
I'd like a...

600
00:52:17.802 --> 00:52:20.847
Thank you. Come on. Get in.

601
00:52:21.848 --> 00:52:24.767
- Who's driving?
- You can't drive with two good legs.

602
00:52:24.851 --> 00:52:28.187
- You think I'll let you drive with one?
- That's low, that is.

603
00:52:28.271 --> 00:52:33.442
- You drive like an old granny.
- Come on, Hopalong, get in.

604
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:37.822
Where is she going? She only got out
the hospital a couple of days ago.

605
00:52:37.905 --> 00:52:39.991
I know.

606
00:52:49.709 --> 00:52:51.794
You let me do it.

607
00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:03.139
Look! Veronica Guerin.
Come here. Have a look.

608
00:53:03.264 --> 00:53:05.349
Tommy Mullen?

609
00:53:19.864 --> 00:53:21.657
Fatso Mitchell?

610
00:53:22.617 --> 00:53:25.119
- Yeah.
- This is for you.

611
00:53:29.957 --> 00:53:32.043
Get the fuck out of here. Here!

612
00:53:35.588 --> 00:53:40.301
- Your column's upsetting me mother.
- Ah, you poor fella.

613
00:53:40.384 --> 00:53:45.431
You think I'm a drug dealer, don't you?
Well, I'm no drug dealer.

614
00:53:45.514 --> 00:53:50.394
I've seen family and friends dying
week in, week out because of 'em.

615
00:53:50.478 --> 00:53:53.856
All right. Why did you shoot me?

616
00:53:56.484 --> 00:54:01.155
No, I had nothing to do with shooting you.
I wouldn't have missed.

617
00:54:08.955 --> 00:54:11.916
I'm telling you, he isn't here.

618
00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:15.044
And I have to go. I'm busy.

619
00:54:15.127 --> 00:54:17.964
- How old are you?
- None of your business.

620
00:54:18.047 --> 00:54:21.175
Please, just give this to Traynor.

621
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:25.471
Are you gonna be OK?
I mean, your leg and all?

622
00:54:25.554 --> 00:54:27.890
Yeah, I'm grand.

623
00:54:28.683 --> 00:54:31.060
Are you gonna be all right?

624
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:40.695
And I thought... I mean, I've always
believed that... Well, I'm a journalist.

625
00:54:40.778 --> 00:54:45.783
Nobody shoots the messenger.
I mean, a journalist doesn't get shot.

626
00:54:45.866 --> 00:54:50.329
If the bullet had hit an artery,
you could have died.

627
00:54:50.413 --> 00:54:53.207
So why do you do it?
Why do you take the risks?

628
00:54:53.249 --> 00:54:59.964
Well, I'll give her this. It takes some balls
to shoot yourself in the leg for publicity.

629
00:55:00.047 --> 00:55:03.634
- She should have shot herself in the balls.
- Bigger target.

630
00:55:03.718 --> 00:55:08.222
- Shall we?
- Never liked this place anyway.

631
00:55:08.264 --> 00:55:14.020
She can always use the insurance money
for a course in journalism.

632
00:55:28.951 --> 00:55:31.746
Here. Check this out.

633
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:35.583
...bringing to the attention
of the public generally

634
00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:40.921
a culture that exists in our society
that nobody knows anything about.

635
00:55:41.005 --> 00:55:43.924
Your girlfriend's looking
very fucking healthy.

636
00:55:44.008 --> 00:55:46.385
Too bad the moron you hired
shot her in the leg.

637
00:55:46.469 --> 00:55:50.014
Now the whole country's watching her,
thanks to you.

638
00:55:50.097 --> 00:55:53.809
She's a real martyr, thanks to you, Coach.

639
00:55:53.893 --> 00:55:56.937
Saint Veronica of the Sunday Independent.

640
00:55:57.021 --> 00:56:02.526
Relax, will you? She's convinced
it was Gerry Hutch that done it.

641
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:05.321
You better pray she stays that way.

642
00:56:05.404 --> 00:56:07.615
Come on.

643
00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:10.159
Champagne - now.

644
00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:14.538
These letters that you delivered.
What did you say in them?

645
00:56:14.622 --> 00:56:17.333
There was one simple question
on each of the letters,

646
00:56:17.416 --> 00:56:21.587
and it was
"Were you responsible for my attack?"

647
00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.226
Mr Gregory?

648
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:39.355
What are you doing here? How did you get
past Security? You can't just barge in.

649
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.483
I'm sorry. Do you mind if I sit down?

650
00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:48.489
A young woman wounded, on a crutch.
I'd be at a disadvantage. Take a seat.

651
00:56:48.572 --> 00:56:51.992
I've come to apologise,
if I've got it all wrong.

652
00:56:52.076 --> 00:56:55.621
All of you journalists have got it wrong.

653
00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:59.083
You call these guys the Viper,
the Monk, the General.

654
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:01.502
You glorify them. They're not movie stars.

655
00:57:01.585 --> 00:57:04.296
With respect, I've no option.

656
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.716
I can't name them.
Your libel laws won't let me.

657
00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.469
Journalists are going to jail
for doing their job.

658
00:57:10.553 --> 00:57:14.390
Liz Allen, she's facing imprisonment
for exposing these murderers.

659
00:57:14.473 --> 00:57:17.309
I'm not getting involved
in your personal vendettas.

660
00:57:17.393 --> 00:57:21.105
- I'm not here because I was shot.
- Now we know what you're not here for.

661
00:57:21.188 --> 00:57:26.944
Look, I've been writing quite extensively,
in a balanced way, for the past 18 months.

662
00:57:27.027 --> 00:57:32.491
You must have missed some of my articles.
On June 11th - I just want to clarify this -

663
00:57:32.575 --> 00:57:36.203
I suggested extending
detention periods for drug offenders.

664
00:57:36.287 --> 00:57:40.499
Then on July 16th I wrote about tax
officials - I mean, this is ridiculous -

665
00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:43.544
saying that they are paid
only to record declared income,

666
00:57:43.627 --> 00:57:46.422
not to worry about
whether it comes from drugs.

667
00:57:46.505 --> 00:57:49.216
Then on July 23rd
I wrote about the gardai.

668
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:54.138
They can seize drug proceeds but can't
hold them. How frustrating is that?

669
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:58.517
I don't need you to tell me the fight against
drugs has been hampered, crippled,

670
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:01.270
by the laws that we have at the moment.

671
00:58:01.353 --> 00:58:05.691
- We're on the same side, Mr Gregory.
- We're on the same side?

672
00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:09.778
I don't like your methods,
and I do not like your paper.

673
00:58:09.862 --> 00:58:14.450
Yeah. It's a rag. But it's a popular rag.

674
00:58:14.533 --> 00:58:17.286
Use it. Get your message out. Use me.

675
00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:20.456
You've got to change these laws
that favour the criminals.

676
00:58:20.581 --> 00:58:24.460
When do we get to the part where you
use me? Or is this just a charity offer?

677
00:58:24.585 --> 00:58:30.216
Well, I'm looking into a guy called Gilligan.
Just take my phone calls.

678
00:58:35.971 --> 00:58:38.474
Gilligan, did you say?

679
00:58:38.557 --> 00:58:42.144
Friend of mine said he rents these
containers out. Seen him about much?

680
00:58:42.228 --> 00:58:45.481
Slightly overweight, like? Bald guy?

681
00:58:45.564 --> 00:58:48.108
We've never seen him here.

682
00:58:48.192 --> 00:58:50.778
- Thanks for the smoke.
- Yeah.

683
00:58:56.659 --> 00:59:02.206
Willy, do me a favour, will you? Find out
how long Tony Gregory'll be in his office.

684
00:59:02.289 --> 00:59:04.667
Hiya. Look, no offence,

685
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:09.380
but these guys are not gonna talk to me
with the cops hanging about. All right?

686
00:59:09.463 --> 00:59:11.924
- Right.
- Thanks. It's not working.

687
00:59:12.007 --> 00:59:16.804
Gilligan's listed here as living
in a council flat on the dole.

688
00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:19.014
That's just a mailing address.

689
00:59:19.098 --> 00:59:24.520
Those lads go to meetings with their
probation officers in BMWs and Mercedes.

690
00:59:24.645 --> 00:59:28.190
Having money isn't a probation violation.

691
00:59:28.274 --> 00:59:31.068
It is if the assets are illegal.

692
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:35.864
Now, then I'd like to see a register
of ownership for the following properties,

693
00:59:35.948 --> 00:59:40.035
and this corporation here,
with a copy of the shareholders reports.

694
00:59:40.119 --> 00:59:44.248
And the same for these other companies
run by a man named John Gilligan.

695
00:59:52.464 --> 00:59:55.217
I told you,
this office is closed for lunch,

696
00:59:55.301 --> 00:59:59.138
so unless you're on staff or with
the government, it's always closed to you.

697
00:59:59.221 --> 01:00:02.224
Not a problem. I've got a friend
who'd like to talk to you.

698
01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:04.476
Do you know Tony Gregory?

699
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.374
Oh, you're an angel.

700
01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:31.462
- I'm just finishing up.
- You're a bad liar.

701
01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.797
Oh, God.
You make the worst cup of coffee.

702
01:00:33.881 --> 01:00:37.426
Here. I'll help you put Cathal to bed.

703
01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:40.012
He's been asleep for an hour.

704
01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:43.390
Of course.

705
01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:51.899
Don't you ever just wanna keep him
in the house? Not let him out ever?

706
01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:55.611
Yeah. But mostly I feel that way about you.

707
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:07.081
I've got him, Graham. I've got his name.

708
01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:11.627
I'm gonna get this Gilligan bastard.

709
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:15.047
I am so close, you know. I'm this close.

710
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:22.054
Do you trust me?

711
01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:23.639
Right?

712
01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:25.808
Don't worry.

713
01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:29.645
Easy for you to say.

714
01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:27.911
How are you? Do you know
where I might find Mr Gilligan?

715
01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:35.085
- Sorry. Don't know.
- Right.

716
01:03:35.354 --> 01:03:40.359
Mr Gilligan? I'm Veronica Guerin
from the Sunday Independent.

717
01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:43.612
I've come to ask some questions
about your property ownership,

718
01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:49.034
including this lovely
equestrian centre you've got here.

719
01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:52.329
You could start by telling me
where you get the money.

720
01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:58.794
Cunt! Cunt!

721
01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.421
Cunt!

722
01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:07.386
Cunt! Cunt!

723
01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:23.944
- Are you wearing a wire?
- No! No!

724
01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:27.239
Get off my property, you cunt!

725
01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:24.338
Jesus! Jesus, what happened to you?

726
01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:28.175
What happened to you, darling? God! God!

727
01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.344
What happened to you?

728
01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:34.848
Oh, my darling. Oh, my darling.

729
01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.148
Can you see it all?

730
01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:45.317
Right.

731
01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:55.494
- Are you ready to go home?
- Yeah.

732
01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:58.914
- You wanna try a drop of that?
- Thanks.

733
01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:03.669
Look, it's up to you, Ronnie,

734
01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:08.215
but if you do press charges,
writing their story might prejudice the case.

735
01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.676
I know you. You just want to steal it.

736
01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:13.345
Of course I do. I'm a reporter.

737
01:06:14.388 --> 01:06:21.353
So what's it to be, Veronica? Do you want
the story or do you want to press charges?

738
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.836
Yeah?

739
01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:48.463
This is John Gilligan.

740
01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:52.092
If you do one thing on me,

741
01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:57.973
if you go to the gardai or write about me,

742
01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:04.229
I'm gonna kidnap your son
and I'm gonna ride him.

743
01:07:05.397 --> 01:07:07.482
I'm gonna shoot you.

744
01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:12.487
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

745
01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:18.243
I'm gonna fucking kidnap your son
and I'm gonna ride him,

746
01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:20.829
and then I'm gonna shoot you.

747
01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:24.332
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

748
01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.228
- Veronica.
- Where's Cathal?

749
01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:46.897
- What's wrong?
- Where's Cathal?

750
01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:50.025
He's in the country.
He's with your sister. He's safe.

751
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:52.235
Jesus.

752
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:56.531
- It was him.
- What?

753
01:07:56.615 --> 01:08:00.994
I should never have gone there. Oh, Jesus!

754
01:08:01.036 --> 01:08:05.665
- I'm so scared, Graham. I'm really scared.
- I know, I know, I know.

755
01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.043
It's going to be all right.

756
01:08:13.882 --> 01:08:17.636
- I want you to promise me something.
- What?

757
01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:23.141
- Don't tell anyone I was like this.
- What?

758
01:08:23.225 --> 01:08:25.519
All right?

759
01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:29.189
- I don't want them to have it.
- All right.

760
01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:31.900
That's what they want more than anything.

761
01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:35.195
I promise you. You were never afraid.

762
01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:38.281
All right. Oh, Jesus.

763
01:08:38.365 --> 01:08:40.450
Never afraid.

764
01:08:52.963 --> 01:08:56.049
Jesus, Veronica. Look at you.

765
01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:58.301
I'll live.

766
01:08:58.385 --> 01:09:00.512
How are you, John?

767
01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:04.182
It's... been a while.

768
01:09:04.266 --> 01:09:06.351
I'm grand. Get you a drink?

769
01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.770
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

770
01:09:08.854 --> 01:09:11.982
So, what do you want to talk about?

771
01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:22.492
- I've a message for you from John Gilligan.
- The man you don't know.

772
01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:28.707
As soon as I heard, I went to see him.
I told him he'd got it all wrong.

773
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:31.626
He's a small man with a chip. You know.

774
01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:34.838
He's got a temper. He just lost his head.

775
01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:38.550
Anyway, he wants you to know
that he's sorry for what he done,

776
01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:42.762
and for what he said
about your kid and the family.

777
01:09:42.846 --> 01:09:45.348
He'd never do those things.

778
01:09:46.558 --> 01:09:49.269
He wishes he could take it back.

779
01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:54.566
Gilligan got you to feed me
that shite about Hutch.

780
01:09:55.692 --> 01:10:00.572
Yeah. He murdered Cahill, stepped back
and let the IRA take credit.

781
01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:04.993
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm here because he wants this to end

782
01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:07.454
before things get any worse.

783
01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.956
How can it get any worse?

784
01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.668
Things can always get worse, Veronica.

785
01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:23.553
Now, if you don't press charges,
you'll be £100,000 richer within an hour.

786
01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:29.351
It's not enough. I want 300.

787
01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:38.193
- I think I could get you that.
- Right.

788
01:10:39.361 --> 01:10:42.155
You tell Gilligan that
he's not gonna be buying me off.

789
01:10:42.197 --> 01:10:46.701
Nobody's trying to buy you off.
The man just wants to be fair, that's all.

790
01:10:46.785 --> 01:10:49.454
Even if he's convicted,
all he'll get is six months.

791
01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:53.416
Right, well, if he's not worried,
why is he prepared to pay so much?

792
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.836
Why did he bother sending a messenger?

793
01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:02.467
You're not the Coach at all,
are you, Johnny?

794
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.928
You're the ball boy.

795
01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:09.599
What are you doing, talking to
her like this, after what you did?

796
01:11:09.683 --> 01:11:12.644
What the fuck are you doing here?
Get out of here.

797
01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:16.731
- He sent that man to shoot you.
- That's a load of bollocks.

798
01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:19.359
- Don't listen to this junkie slag.
- It's true.

799
01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:24.239
He said the man was supposed to shoot
you in the head, but the gun didn't work.

800
01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:26.032
Veronica!

801
01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:14.456
I've decided to make a formal complaint
against the guy who beat me.

802
01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:19.669
I mean, I would... I would lose a lot,

803
01:12:19.753 --> 01:12:24.299
right, if I was to give in to these thugs,
and I'm not going to be doing that,

804
01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.843
because it'd be worse for me
and for journalism

805
01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:30.930
if I or any journalist
was to be intimidated.

806
01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.016
That means they've won.

807
01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.560
And they're not going to win.

808
01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:38.104
Fuck off!

809
01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:42.650
"The house shuddered and collapsed,

810
01:12:42.734 --> 01:12:45.028
and then the little people discovered

811
01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:49.574
that they were disappearing
into a swirl of leaves."

812
01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:57.957
He's fast asleep.

813
01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.293
Thanks for watching him, Ma.

814
01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:04.923
What should a girl wear to court?
Maybe the navy.

815
01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:08.551
- This one looks grand.
- Oh, look.

816
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:12.263
Ah, look at that.

817
01:13:15.517 --> 01:13:19.979
Look at you always trying
to be better than the boys.

818
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:25.485
That reminds me, you know, of a day -
I don't know how old you were.

819
01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:29.948
You were out playing football and the ball
went over the wall into Old Man Clancy's.

820
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:34.077
Do you remember him? He was
a very dangerous man. Very violent.

821
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.080
The boys did nothing,
but you, bold as brass,

822
01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:41.709
you marched up those steps
and you just knocked on his door.

823
01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:45.755
- Scared the bejasus out of me.
- You didn't show it.

824
01:13:45.839 --> 01:13:49.884
That's your thing, isn't it?
You don't show your fear.

825
01:13:49.968 --> 01:13:56.391
You know, Veronica, sometimes it's wiser
to let the crazy old man keep the ball.

826
01:13:56.516 --> 01:14:00.895
It is, and sometimes
it's braver to just walk away.

827
01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:06.359
Well, I got the ball back, didn't I?

828
01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:12.490
You know exactly what I mean.

829
01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:36.347
In response to a motion by the defence,
I'm granting an extension until June 30th.

830
01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:40.852
- This hearing is adjourned.
- I'm sorry.

831
01:14:46.858 --> 01:14:50.361
Hey. You haven't seen
the last of us, missis.

832
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.418
Cheers.

833
01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:26.022
You all right?

834
01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:28.858
I've got a speeding issue
to deal with tomorrow.

835
01:15:28.942 --> 01:15:32.153
You're big in Naas. You haven't
bought off any judges, have you?

836
01:15:32.237 --> 01:15:33.780
- Who is it?
- Ballaugh.

837
01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:38.618
Can't help you. I hope you didn't take
what that junkie slag said seriously.

838
01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.496
Her brain burned out months ago.

839
01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:45.625
And you didn't call me here
to talk about a speeding ticket.

840
01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.628
Changed your mind about Gilligan's offer?

841
01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:52.757
I'm writing a story.
Just want to clear some things up.

842
01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.178
- You're my man.
- What do you wanna know?

843
01:15:57.262 --> 01:16:01.391
How you guys launder all the money
you're making from the drug deals.

844
01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:04.811
- Is it the Amsterdam casinos?
- Are you saying I'm a drug dealer?

845
01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:10.400
Would you talk straight to me? The two car
franchises, the yacht, the house, holidays.

846
01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:15.113
All that comes from the brothels? Don't the
taxmen ask where the money comes from?

847
01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:19.409
You think I'd threaten those tax fellas?
That's bullshit. I was with me accountant.

848
01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:24.289
The taxman was very fair.
I'm legit. They can't touch me.

849
01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:28.251
Who shot me, John?

850
01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:33.381
- You know as well as I do, Veronica.
- Yeah. I need to hear it from you.

851
01:16:33.464 --> 01:16:35.550
Gerry Hutch.

852
01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:38.094
I'd say I'm one of the
only people in Dublin who

853
01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:41.139
knows who did ninety percent
of the hits last year.

854
01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:46.144
- Cos you're Gilligan's partner, right?
- Look, I'm a fairly minor player.

855
01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:48.563
You've seen Gilligan's house.

856
01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:53.109
He has a two or three million fucking horse
shed out the front that'll hold 8,000 people.

857
01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:56.112
I'm not in his league.

858
01:16:56.195 --> 01:17:01.284
So why are you asking me all
these questions? What's the story about?

859
01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:03.453
You.

860
01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:06.748
- Me?
- Yeah.

861
01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:09.876
I'm gonna say you're a dealer,
name you, quote you on Hutch.

862
01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.462
- You can't do that, Veronica.
- I think I can.

863
01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:15.798
- You do that and I'm a fucking dead man.
- You poor fella.

864
01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:19.719
Listen to me, Veronica,
I'm trying to fucking help you.

865
01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:24.182
Take Gilligan's offer. I can't control him,
and you don't know how far he'll go

866
01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.351
to keep from going back to prison.

867
01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:28.936
I came with a photographer from the paper.

868
01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:33.483
He's standing over there
next to the police. Smile.

869
01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:40.531
Let go of my door, John.

870
01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:35.670
Hello? Just a minute. Hello?

871
01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:41.551
She'll be at the Naas Courthouse
tomorrow morning.

872
01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:14.834
Come the fuck with me. Go on.

873
01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:59.378
£100 fine.

874
01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:02.924
Thank you.

875
01:20:04.342 --> 01:20:06.177
Well done.

876
01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:12.076
She's out.

877
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:29.427
Mum, I'm driving!
Can you believe it? He let me off.

878
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.930
He actually let me off.
I love you. Talk to you.

879
01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:47.945
Yeah. Another repeat offender
returned to decent society.

880
01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:10.968
She's on her way.

881
01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:29.904
I told him I was guilty as sin.

882
01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:52.653
Veronica?

883
01:23:54.405 --> 01:23:56.615
Veronica?

884
01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:52.434
Veronica Guerin's writing
turned the tide in the drug war.

885
01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:56.689
Her murder galvanised Ireland into action.

886
01:27:56.772 --> 01:28:01.193
Thousands of people took to the streets
in weekly anti-drug marches,

887
01:28:01.235 --> 01:28:08.033
which drove the dealers out of Dublin
and forced the drug barons underground.

888
01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:23.549
Within a week of her death, during
an emergency session of Parliament,

889
01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:27.261
the government altered the constitution
of the Republic of Ireland

890
01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:33.392
to allow the high court to freeze
the assets of suspected drug barons.

891
01:28:44.862 --> 01:28:49.241
That same year, the Criminal
Assets Bureau, CAB, was formed

892
01:28:49.283 --> 01:28:51.410
and given the power to access and seize

893
01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:55.664
unexplained wealth
from suspected criminals.

894
01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:15.768
Charles Bowden turned state's evidence
and became the first person in Irish history

895
01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:20.522
to be entered into
the witness protection programme.

896
01:29:34.995 --> 01:29:37.498
Brian Meehan was sentenced
to life imprisonment

897
01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:39.666
for the murder of Veronica Guerin,

898
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:42.878
and his assets were seized by the CAB.

899
01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:51.512
Eugene Holland was sentenced
to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking.

900
01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:54.181
His assets were seized by CAB.

901
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.936
John Traynor escaped to Portugal

902
01:29:59.019 --> 01:30:02.898
and continues to fight extradition
to Ireland on charges of murder.

903
01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:06.110
His assets were seized by the CAB.

904
01:30:18.956 --> 01:30:20.916
After a long extradition battle,

905
01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:23.836
John Gilligan was brought back to Ireland
from England

906
01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:27.881
and sentenced to
28 years in prison for drug trafficking.

907
01:30:27.965 --> 01:30:30.551
His assets were seized by CAB.

908
01:30:49.862 --> 01:30:53.157
Everyone in the Republic of Ireland
remembers where they were

909
01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:59.204
when they heard that Veronica Guerin
had been murdered on the Naas Road.
