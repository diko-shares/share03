WEBVTT

1
00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:24.316
And that completes my final
report until we reach touchdown.

2
00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:27.819
We're now on full automatic
in the hands of the computers.

3
00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:31.447
I've tucked my crew in
for the long sleep...

4
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.034
and I'll be joining them soon.

5
00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:39.415
In less than an hour, we'll finish
our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.

6
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710
Six months in deep space,
by our time, that is.

7
00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:47.627
According to Dr. Hasslein's
theory of time...

8
00:00:47.653 --> 00:00:50.365
in a vehicle traveling
nearly the speed of light...

9
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:54.409
the Earth has aged
nearly 700 years since we left it...

10
00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.657
while we've aged hardly at all.

11
00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:00.634
Ah!...

12
00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:04.647
Maybe so.
This much is probably true.

13
00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:08.641
The men who sent us on this journey
are long since dead and gone.

14
00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:12.806
You who are reading me now
are a different breed.

15
00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:14.902
I hope a better one.

16
00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:18.758
I leave the 20th century
with no regrets.

17
00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.354
But one more thing,
if anybody's listening, that is.

18
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.025
Nothing scientific.
It's purely personal.

19
00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:30.647
But seen from out here...

20
00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:35.288
everything seems different,
time bends...

21
00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.874
space is... boundless.

22
00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:41.387
It squashes a man's ego.

23
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.028
I feel lonely.

24
00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:54.904
That's about it.

25
00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.869
Tell me though.

26
00:02:00.648 --> 00:02:03.800
does man,
that marvel of the universe...

27
00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:07.262
that glorious paradox
who sent me to the stars...

28
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.445
still make war
against his brother...

29
00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.553
keep his neighbor's
children starving?

30
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.420
* PLANET OF THE APES *

31
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.437
You all right?

32
00:07:24.804 --> 00:07:25.947
Stewart?

33
00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:30.804
Stewart.

34
00:07:50.466 --> 00:07:55.494
We're in the soup. She's sinking.
Dodge, read the atmosphere.

35
00:08:09.858 --> 00:08:13.345
Landon!
Get out a last signal!

36
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:15.223
What signal?

37
00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:18.156
To Earth that we've landed.

38
00:09:00.229 --> 00:09:01.779
The air's okay.

39
00:09:02.435 --> 00:09:06.070
Blow the hatch before
we lose all our power.

40
00:09:13.618 --> 00:09:15.554
 It's no use. The power's gone.

41
00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:18.137
Forget it. Abandon ship.

42
00:11:04.903 --> 00:11:06.082
She's sinking.

43
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:11.234
Going...

44
00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:14.774
going...

45
00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:19.602
gone.

46
00:11:23.854 --> 00:11:26.535
Okay. We're here to stay.

47
00:11:40.314 --> 00:11:44.165
Well, where are we?
Do you have any notions' Skipper?

48
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.619
We're some 320 light-years
from Earth...

49
00:11:47.645 --> 00:11:49.602
on an unnamed planet in orbit,

50
00:11:49.628 --> 00:11:52.628
around a star
in the constellation of Orion.

51
00:11:52.684 --> 00:11:54.336
Is that close enough for you?

52
00:11:56.633 --> 00:12:00.897
Could be Bellatrix.
It's too white for Bellatrix.

53
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:03.406
You didn't have time
to read the tapes.

54
00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:06.851
So you really
don't know, do you?

55
00:12:06.877 --> 00:12:08.234
What went wrong?

56
00:12:09.006 --> 00:12:11.405
We weren't programmed
to land in the water.

57
00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:15.401
The question is not so much where
we are, as when we are.

58
00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:19.359
All right, we've had enough
sleep to hold us a while.

59
00:12:19.385 --> 00:12:21.568
Let's start earning
all that back pay.

60
00:13:00.323 --> 00:13:02.398
Dodge, run your soil test.

61
00:13:05.023 --> 00:13:07.772
Got your sensors?
Right.

62
00:13:07.798 --> 00:13:09.837
Geiger counter?
Got it.

63
00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:14.869
Let's see, one pistol...

64
00:13:15.466 --> 00:13:20.454
twenty rounds ammo,
a medical kit, camera, TX-9.

65
00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:24.266
We've got food and water enough
for three days.

66
00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:26.237
How long is a day?

67
00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:29.593
That's a good question. Landon.

68
00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:31.816
Hey, Landon!

69
00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:34.236
Join the expedition.

70
00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.337
Sorry.
I was thinking about Stewart.

71
00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.358
What do you suppose happened?
Air leak.

72
00:13:42.384 --> 00:13:46.064
She died in her sleep.
You don't seem very cut up about it.

73
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.237
It's a little late for a wake.
She's been dead nearly a year.

74
00:13:50.483 --> 00:13:53.467
That means we've been away
from Earth for 18 months.

75
00:13:53.493 --> 00:13:54.567
Our time.

76
00:13:56.673 --> 00:13:58.022
You've gone gray.

77
00:14:00.224 --> 00:14:04.644
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper
for a man who's 2,031 years old.

78
00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:08.734
I read the clocks.
They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.

79
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.385
We have been away from Earth
for 2,000 years...

80
00:14:12.411 --> 00:14:14.048
give or take a decade.

81
00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:17.583
Still can't accept it, huh?

82
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.979
Time's wiped out
everything you ever knew.

83
00:14:21.284 --> 00:14:22.403
It's all dust.

84
00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.235
Prove it.

85
00:14:24.843 --> 00:14:28.308
If we can't get back,
it's still just a theory.

86
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:32.335
It's a fact, Landon.
Buy it. You'll sleep better.

87
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.832
Nothing will grow here.

88
00:14:35.326 --> 00:14:37.423
There's just a trace
of carbohydrates.

89
00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.899
All the nitrogen is
locked into the nitrates.

90
00:14:40.724 --> 00:14:43.237
No dangerous ionization?
No.

91
00:14:44.346 --> 00:14:47.547
Well, if there's no life here...

92
00:14:47.573 --> 00:14:50.504
we've got just 72 hours to find it.

93
00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:52.850
That's when the
groceries run out.

94
00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:55.150
Let's go.
Which direction?

95
00:14:58.091 --> 00:15:00.523
That way.
Any particular reason?

96
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.870
None at all.

97
00:15:06.703 --> 00:15:07.850
Come on.

98
00:17:58.327 --> 00:17:59.703
Everybody all right?

99
00:18:01.558 --> 00:18:02.934
Water check.

100
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:12.986
Eight ounces.

101
00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:21.236
It doesn't add up.

102
00:18:22.137 --> 00:18:24.103
Thunder and lightning and no rain.

103
00:18:24.329 --> 00:18:27.939
Cloud cover at night,
that strange

104
00:18:27.965 --> 00:18:30.976
luminosity, yet there's no moon.
If we could just get a fix.

105
00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:32.594
What would that tell you?

106
00:18:33.069 --> 00:18:35.278
I've told you where you
are and when you are.

107
00:18:35.351 --> 00:18:36.540
All right, all right.

108
00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:41.248
You're 300 light years
from your precious planet.

109
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:45.707
Your loved ones are dead
and forgotten for 20 centuries.

110
00:18:45.733 --> 00:18:48.368
Twenty centuries!
Even if you could get back...

111
00:18:48.394 --> 00:18:50.884
they would think you were something
that fell out of a tree.

112
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.714
Ah, Taylor, quit riding him.

113
00:18:53.218 --> 00:18:55.859
There is just one reality left
we are here and it is now.

114
00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.707
You get a hold of that and hang on to it,
or you might as well be dead.

115
00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:01.188
I'm prepared to die.

116
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.526
He-He's prepared to die.

117
00:19:06.425 --> 00:19:08.271
Doesn't that make you misty?

118
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.871
Chalk up another victory
for the human spirit.

119
00:19:19.828 --> 00:19:21.773
Clue me in on something,
will you?

120
00:19:21.803 --> 00:19:26.081
Why did you sign on for this trip?
You volunteered. Why?

121
00:19:26.435 --> 00:19:28.721
Never mind.
I'll clue you in.

122
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.002
You were the golden boy
of the class of '72.

123
00:19:32.028 --> 00:19:35.030
When they nominated you for the big one,
you couldn't turn it down...

124
00:19:35.056 --> 00:19:37.702
not without losing
your All-American image.

125
00:19:38.245 --> 00:19:39.635
Climb off, will you?

126
00:19:40.064 --> 00:19:42.603
Oh, and the glory.
Don't forget that.

127
00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:47.971
There's a life-size bronze statue of you
standing out there somewhere.

128
00:19:48.215 --> 00:19:51.611
Oh, it's probably turned green by now,
nobody can read the nameplate.

129
00:19:51.943 --> 00:19:54.412
But never let it be said
that we forget our heroes.

130
00:19:54.438 --> 00:19:56.533
Taylor, I'm telling you
to climb off my back.

131
00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.668
Hmm. And there's one last item
immortality.

132
00:19:59.694 --> 00:20:01.577
You wanted to live forever,
didn't you?

133
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.635
Well, you damn near made it.

134
00:20:04.298 --> 00:20:05.747
Except for me and Dodge,

135
00:20:05.773 --> 00:20:08.428
you've lived longer
than anyone ever born.

136
00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:12.733
And with our lovely
Lieutenant Stewart dead...

137
00:20:13.248 --> 00:20:15.547
looks like you're
the last of the line.

138
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:20.071
You got what you wanted, Tiger.
How does it taste?

139
00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.591
Okay, you read me well enough.

140
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.141
But why can't I read you?
Don't bother.

141
00:20:28.192 --> 00:20:32.070
Dodge, there, he's not like me at all,
but he makes sense.

142
00:20:33.849 --> 00:20:36.216
He'd walk naked into a live volcano...

143
00:20:36.251 --> 00:20:39.101
if he thought he could learn something
that no other man knew.

144
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.759
But you, you're no seeker.
You're negative.

145
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.966
And I'm not prepared to die.

146
00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.556
I'd like to know why not.

147
00:20:48.889 --> 00:20:50.988
You thought life
on Earth was meaningless.

148
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.680
You despised people.

149
00:20:53.137 --> 00:20:55.505
So what'd you do?
You ran out.

150
00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:58.290
No. No, it's not like that Landon.

151
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:00.311
I'm a seeker too.

152
00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:02.902
But my dreams aren't like yours.

153
00:21:03.291 --> 00:21:05.718
I can't help thinking
somewhere in the universe...

154
00:21:05.744 --> 00:21:08.204
there has to be something
better than man.

155
00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:09.369
Has to be.

156
00:21:12.093 --> 00:21:13.869
Taylor, over here!

157
00:21:53.474 --> 00:21:54.624
Life.

158
00:22:09.391 --> 00:22:11.642
Where there's one,
there's another...

159
00:22:11.775 --> 00:22:14.204
and another and another.

160
00:22:14.512 --> 00:22:16.078
Let's find 'em.

161
00:24:51.293 --> 00:24:52.497
Skipper!

162
00:24:54.373 --> 00:24:55.505
Look.

163
00:25:12.187 --> 00:25:13.322
Scarecrows?

164
00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:16.207
Let's see.

165
00:26:03.227 --> 00:26:05.157
To hell with the scarecrows.

166
00:26:47.013 --> 00:26:48.668
Yee-hoo!

167
00:26:48.694 --> 00:26:51.159
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

168
00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.775
Heah!...

169
00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:04.933
Ah!... Whoo!

170
00:27:05.693 --> 00:27:06.819
 Whoo!

171
00:27:07.012 --> 00:27:09.441
Yea! Yea!

172
00:27:18.524 --> 00:27:19.678
Ah!

173
00:27:27.308 --> 00:27:28.479
Taylor.

174
00:27:30.191 --> 00:27:31.435
Look at this.

175
00:27:56.792 --> 00:27:58.093
Taylor, look!

176
00:29:44.332 --> 00:29:46.104
They didn't leave much,
did they?

177
00:30:16.792 --> 00:30:19.213
Well, at least
they haven't tried to bite us.

178
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.434
Blessed are the vegetarians.

179
00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:32.293
They look more or less human,
but I think they're mute.

180
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.737
We got off at the wrong stop.

181
00:30:46.734 --> 00:30:49.017
You're supposed to be
the optimist, Landon.

182
00:30:49.568 --> 00:30:51.137
Look on the bright side.

183
00:30:51.875 --> 00:30:53.904
If this is the best
they've got around here...

184
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.021
in six months
we'll be running this planet.

185
00:35:59.287 --> 00:36:00.435
Smile.

186
00:36:40.445 --> 00:36:43.068
Which one was wearing
the strange clothes?

187
00:36:43.937 --> 00:36:45.273
This one.

188
00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:51.874
Will he live?
I don't know.

189
00:36:52.235 --> 00:36:54.829
This beast has lost
a lot of blood.

190
00:37:01.715 --> 00:37:05.113
There's no probe here. Find one.
Yes, sir.

191
00:37:06.243 --> 00:37:08.489
This place is dirty, Doctor.

192
00:37:09.003 --> 00:37:11.924
Doctor' these animals are dirty.

193
00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:15.062
They stink and they carry
communicable diseases.

194
00:37:15.197 --> 00:37:17.412
Why aren't they cleaned up
before they're brought here?

195
00:37:17.438 --> 00:37:19.450
You don't sound happy in your work.

196
00:37:19.748 --> 00:37:22.291
I'm little more than a vet
in this laboratory.

197
00:37:22.828 --> 00:37:25.676
You promised to speak
to Dr. Zaius about me.

198
00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:29.580
I did. You know how he looks down
his nose at chimpanzees.

199
00:37:29.606 --> 00:37:32.062
But the quota system
has been abolished.

200
00:37:32.096 --> 00:37:35.269
You made it. Why can't I?
What do you mean "made it"?

201
00:37:35.393 --> 00:37:39.035
I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.
We have no authority.

202
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:42.683
You do all right when it comes
to getting space and equipment.

203
00:37:42.709 --> 00:37:46.904
That's because Dr. Zaius
realizes our work has value.

204
00:37:47.274 --> 00:37:51.525
The foundations of scientific brain surgery
are being laid right here...

205
00:37:51.551 --> 00:37:54.703
in studies of cerebral functions
of these animals.

206
00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:57.585
They're still dirty, Doctor.

207
00:37:58.232 --> 00:38:00.900
And their bite is septic.
There, look at that.

208
00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:04.735
Hold his jaw.

209
00:38:30.251 --> 00:38:32.483
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Good morning, Julius.

210
00:38:32.509 --> 00:38:33.953
How's our patient today?

211
00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:37.376
No change. The minute you open
the door, he goes into his act.

212
00:38:40.626 --> 00:38:44.402
Well. And what do
we want this morning?

213
00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:47.354
Do we want something?
Come on, speak.

214
00:38:47.864 --> 00:38:50.055
Come on, speak.

215
00:38:50.743 --> 00:38:53.129
Do we want some sugar,
old-timer? Hmm?

216
00:38:55.558 --> 00:38:57.643
You could get hurt doing that,
Doctor.

217
00:38:57.669 --> 00:39:00.070
Oh, don't be silly.
He's perfectly tame.

218
00:39:00.096 --> 00:39:02.814
Ah, they're all tame
until they take a chunk out of you.

219
00:39:02.949 --> 00:39:06.614
Well, Bright Eyes,
is our throat feeling better?

220
00:39:08.183 --> 00:39:09.919
Still hurts, doesn't it?

221
00:39:09.945 --> 00:39:13.080
See, he keeps
pretending he can talk.

222
00:39:16.242 --> 00:39:18.737
That Bright Eyes is remarkable.

223
00:39:19.181 --> 00:39:21.850
He keeps trying to form words.

224
00:39:21.975 --> 00:39:24.835
You know what they say.
"Human see, human do".

225
00:39:30.086 --> 00:39:31.200
Now what?

226
00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:36.039
He seems to want something.

227
00:39:37.764 --> 00:39:39.349
I'd be careful, Doctor.

228
00:39:39.932 --> 00:39:43.339
What'd I tell you!
Try that again and I'll break your arm!

229
00:39:46.362 --> 00:39:48.136
Good morning, Your Excellency.

230
00:39:48.854 --> 00:39:50.257
Dr. Zaius.

231
00:39:52.551 --> 00:39:53.791
Good morning, sir.

232
00:39:55.292 --> 00:39:58.987
Open up, please.
I'm so glad you could come.

233
00:39:59.627 --> 00:40:01.915
Sir, he's over here.

234
00:40:04.205 --> 00:40:08.140
Bright Eyes... show him.

235
00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.187
Go ahead, do your trick.

236
00:40:11.295 --> 00:40:14.850
Speak. Go on, speak again.

237
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.293
There! Can you believe it?

238
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:24.167
Yes, amusing.
A man acting like an ape.

239
00:40:27.483 --> 00:40:31.161
Dr. Zaius, I could swear
he's answering you.

240
00:40:31.405 --> 00:40:34.167
He has a definite gift for mimicry.

241
00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:36.614
It's most unusual.

242
00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.528
He's using that
old blanket as clothing.

243
00:40:40.756 --> 00:40:44.767
I wonder how he'd score
on a Hopkins manual dexterity test?

244
00:40:44.811 --> 00:40:48.113
An animal? Look!

245
00:40:48.172 --> 00:40:50.038
He's moving his fingers.

246
00:40:50.474 --> 00:40:52.925
Only because he
saw you moving yours.

247
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:55.761
Oh, but perhaps he understood.

248
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.791
Man has no understanding.

249
00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:03.063
He can be taught a few very simple
tricks, nothing more.

250
00:41:03.503 --> 00:41:07.415
I'm afraid I must disagree.
According to my experiments.

251
00:41:07.441 --> 00:41:10.243
Dr. Zira, I must caution you.

252
00:41:11.498 --> 00:41:15.637
Experimental brain surgery
on these creatures is one thing,

253
00:41:15.663 --> 00:41:17.468
and I'm all in favor of it.

254
00:41:17.737 --> 00:41:21.121
But your behavioral studies
are something else again.

255
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:26.716
To suggest that we can learn anything
about the simian nature...

256
00:41:26.742 --> 00:41:29.615
from a study of man
is sheer nonsense.

257
00:41:30.317 --> 00:41:32.179
Besides, man is a nuisance.

258
00:41:32.542 --> 00:41:35.592
He eats up his food supplies
in the forest...

259
00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:40.727
then migrates to our green belts
and ravages our crops.

260
00:41:43.354 --> 00:41:46.500
The sooner he is exterminated,
the better.

261
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:50.819
It's a question of simian survival.

262
00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.663
Is this the one you wanted,
Doctor?

263
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:07.933
Ah, yes. Thank you.

264
00:42:08.486 --> 00:42:12.197
Bright Eyes.
I've got a present for you.

265
00:42:23.613 --> 00:42:24.933
Put her in with him.

266
00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:52.173
Hmm!...

267
00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:20.533
Cornelius, up here.

268
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:25.124
Do you have to work tonight?
No.

269
00:43:25.297 --> 00:43:26.448
Neither do I.

270
00:43:31.537 --> 00:43:32.991
Oh, Cornelius.

271
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:52.587
There's- There's Bright Eyes.
Hmm?

272
00:43:52.704 --> 00:43:54.621
The one I was telling you about.

273
00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:56.803
What's so special about him?

274
00:43:57.635 --> 00:44:00.890
Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes.

275
00:44:01.196 --> 00:44:02.802
How's our throat today?

276
00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:11.140
Look, she remembers!
Remembers what?

277
00:44:11.166 --> 00:44:14.259
The blood transfusion.
Zira, really.

278
00:44:14.285 --> 00:44:17.546
You know they can't. Hey, hey, watch out.
Here comes Number One.

279
00:44:18.943 --> 00:44:20.382
Something's bothering him.

280
00:44:20.452 --> 00:44:22.839
He's been prying around the
lab for the last two days.

281
00:44:22.865 --> 00:44:25.833
Shh, shh, shh.
Uh, good morning, Dr. Zaius.

282
00:44:26.023 --> 00:44:29.621
You, uh, know my, uh.
Dr. Cornelius, my fiancé.

283
00:44:29.647 --> 00:44:31.930
Of course.
The young ape with a shovel.

284
00:44:31.956 --> 00:44:35.395
I hear you're planning another
archaeological expedition.

285
00:44:35.486 --> 00:44:37.496
With the Academy's approval, sir.

286
00:44:37.522 --> 00:44:40.307
The project will require my
support, of course.

287
00:44:40.333 --> 00:44:41.921
I hope I may count on it, sir.

288
00:44:41.947 --> 00:44:44.210
Cornelius, a friendly warning.

289
00:44:44.703 --> 00:44:49.720
As you dig for artifacts, be sure
you don't bury your reputation.

290
00:45:02.695 --> 00:45:03.868
Stop!

291
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.677
Stop!

292
00:45:29.339 --> 00:45:31.919
Stop! You've hurt him!

293
00:45:32.945 --> 00:45:34.606
Take him inside.

294
00:45:37.865 --> 00:45:42.011
Cornelius? Cornelius,
if you have a moment today...

295
00:45:42.037 --> 00:45:45.815
I'd like to discuss this expedition
of yours in more detail.

296
00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:49.160
Oh, certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes
and I'll come right over.

297
00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:52.642
I don't understand
these animal psychologists.

298
00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:55.139
What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?

299
00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:58.343
That man can be domesticated.

300
00:46:37.269 --> 00:46:40.146
What happened?
Oh, those fools and their torches!

301
00:46:40.214 --> 00:46:42.305
Do you have any ointment?
I'll see.

302
00:46:48.181 --> 00:46:50.187
I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

303
00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:57.266
Julius!

304
00:47:00.358 --> 00:47:02.324
I told you what you'd get!

305
00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.036
Julius, don't, don't, don't.
It doesn't matter.

306
00:47:05.406 --> 00:47:07.022
Julius, don't hurt him!

307
00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:11.786
Julius!

308
00:47:17.831 --> 00:47:20.096
Natural-born thieves, aren't they?

309
00:47:33.444 --> 00:47:36.340
Get me a collar and leash.

310
00:47:36.484 --> 00:47:39.664
I'm taking him out of here.
He's vicious, Doctor.

311
00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.518
Besides, it's against the rules.
Do as I say!

312
00:47:54.243 --> 00:47:58.525
You. You wouldn't
hurt me, would you...

313
00:48:01.064 --> 00:48:02.452
Taylor?

314
00:48:18.972 --> 00:48:20.500
It's a stunt.

315
00:48:20.756 --> 00:48:23.149
Ah, humans can't write.

316
00:48:23.175 --> 00:48:27.723
Dear, you're a scientist.
Don't you believe your own eyes?

317
00:48:31.884 --> 00:48:33.548
Where did you learn
to do this?

318
00:48:37.651 --> 00:48:42.715
"Jefferson Public School".

319
00:48:48.548 --> 00:48:52.498
"Fort Wayne, Indiana".

320
00:48:55.351 --> 00:48:57.814
Back on that planet
you say you came from?

321
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.126
Uh-huh.

322
00:49:03.377 --> 00:49:04.724
Yes, yes.

323
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:09.265
Maybe he is intelligent,
but he's also' uh, crazy.

324
00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:13.241
Cornelius. Cornelius, please.

325
00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:20.966
"Dodge was killed in the hunt.

326
00:49:21.193 --> 00:49:24.153
What happened to Landon?"

327
00:49:26.322 --> 00:49:27.628
I don't know.

328
00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:31.302
They fell out
of the sky with you?

329
00:49:35.856 --> 00:49:38.116
"Not fell, flew".

330
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.602
Flight is a scientific impossibility.

331
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:43.537
And even if it weren't, why fly?

332
00:49:43.693 --> 00:49:45.236
Where would it get you?

333
00:50:02.807 --> 00:50:04.922
"Do you have maps?"

334
00:50:18.442 --> 00:50:22.862
Uh... We're here.
You were captured here.

335
00:50:25.698 --> 00:50:27.765
You fell into the water here?

336
00:50:28.776 --> 00:50:32.487
You came ashore,
marched across the desert...

337
00:50:33.369 --> 00:50:35.278
mountains...

338
00:50:36.711 --> 00:50:38.243
many days and nights.

339
00:50:38.647 --> 00:50:40.807
and reached the jungle.

340
00:50:42.077 --> 00:50:43.949
Out of the question.

341
00:50:45.386 --> 00:50:48.968
Cornelius, why do you insist
on provoking him?

342
00:50:48.994 --> 00:50:51.608
No creature can survive
in the Forbidden Zone.

343
00:50:51.634 --> 00:50:53.467
I know. I've been there.
I've seen it.

344
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:59.368
"Then how do
you account for me?"

345
00:51:00.013 --> 00:51:04.070
I don't.
And I'm not going to try.

346
00:51:06.257 --> 00:51:09.142
But what about your theory?

347
00:51:10.131 --> 00:51:13.592
The existence of someone
like Taylor might prove it.

348
00:51:13.618 --> 00:51:15.709
Zira, do you want
to get my head chopped off?

349
00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:19.833
Don't be foolish.
If it's true, they'll have to accept it.

350
00:51:20.583 --> 00:51:21.851
Oh, no, they won't.

351
00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:26.290
Oh. Cornelius has developed
the most brilliant hypothesis.

352
00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:27.934
But I'm probably wrong.

353
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:33.837
That the ape evolved from
a lower order of primate, possibly man.

354
00:51:34.502 --> 00:51:36.754
In his trip to the Forbidden Zone...

355
00:51:36.886 --> 00:51:41.664
he discovered traces of a culture
older than recorded time.

356
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:45.068
The evidence was very meager.
You didn't think so then.

357
00:51:45.094 --> 00:51:47.170
That was before Dr. Zaius
and half of the Academy

358
00:51:47.196 --> 00:51:48.838
said that my idea was heresy.

359
00:51:48.889 --> 00:51:51.967
How can scientific truth be heresy?

360
00:51:52.449 --> 00:51:57.628
What if Taylor is exactly
the proof you needed? A mutation?

361
00:51:58.131 --> 00:52:03.184
A missing link between
the unevolved primate and the ape?

362
00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:06.857
Touchy, isn't he?

363
00:52:07.886 --> 00:52:11.101
Hmm. "I am not a missing link".

364
00:52:11.629 --> 00:52:13.033
Well, if he were a missing link,

365
00:52:13.059 --> 00:52:15.364
the Sacred Scrolls wouldn't be
worth their parchment.

366
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.718
Well, maybe they're not.

367
00:52:20.042 --> 00:52:23.076
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not going to get into that battle.

368
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.347
Cornelius, show some strength.
Zira, listen to me!

369
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:29.479
Now we both have fine futures-

370
00:52:29.706 --> 00:52:32.247
marriage, stimulating careers.

371
00:52:32.273 --> 00:52:33.806
I'm up for a raise.

372
00:52:35.796 --> 00:52:37.064
Dr. Zaius.

373
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:41.418
Did you forget
our appointment, Cornelius?

374
00:52:41.444 --> 00:52:43.885
Oh, no, sir.
I was, uh, just collecting my notes.

375
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:48.202
You know Dr. Maximus, of course,
our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?

376
00:52:48.228 --> 00:52:50.138
Yes, sir. It's a pleasure
to see you again.

377
00:52:51.537 --> 00:52:55.416
What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.

378
00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:59.458
I know it's a man.
And you know the rules-

379
00:52:59.484 --> 00:53:01.904
No animals allowed
outside the compound...

380
00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.819
and, most especially,
not without a leash.

381
00:53:03.845 --> 00:53:09.247
Uh, yes, sir. But, but this, uh,
creature is a, is a special case.

382
00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:11.135
Why special?

383
00:53:11.315 --> 00:53:14.312
Um, we're conducting
a new experiment.

384
00:53:14.358 --> 00:53:17.537
Wouldn't that more properly
be done in your office?

385
00:53:18.097 --> 00:53:19.181
Yes, sir.

386
00:53:19.249 --> 00:53:22.674
Guards, return this beast
to the compound.

387
00:53:24.082 --> 00:53:25.683
What is this?

388
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.643
A toy. It floats on the air.

389
00:53:32.669 --> 00:53:35.770
Zira. Try it.

390
00:53:35.862 --> 00:53:37.107
Nonsense.

391
00:53:56.093 --> 00:53:57.347
What’s up, Lieutenant?

392
00:53:57.373 --> 00:53:59.642
We're taking Number Four over
to surgery in five minutes.

393
00:53:59.668 --> 00:54:01.314
Have him ready.
How come?

394
00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.131
The beast's throat is nearly healed.

395
00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:05.759
It's not his throat this time.
The vet's gonna geld him.

396
00:54:05.785 --> 00:54:09.121
Dr. Zira won't like it.
She wants that pair to mate.

397
00:54:09.147 --> 00:54:11.526
These orders come
from Dr. Zaius himself.

398
00:54:11.552 --> 00:54:13.369
There's nothing
she can do about it.

399
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:15.899
Ah!...

400
00:54:29.293 --> 00:54:32.515
If only you knew
what they're going to do.

401
00:54:34.286 --> 00:54:36.778
Stay still now.
Don't give me any trouble.

402
00:55:00.381 --> 00:55:01.702
Awou!...

403
00:55:03.606 --> 00:55:05.331
Ah, wou!...

404
00:55:10.391 --> 00:55:14.213
Weep if you must,
but make an end of sorrow.

405
00:55:14.815 --> 00:55:16.839
He lives again.

406
00:55:17.727 --> 00:55:21.006
Yes, he has found peace
in heaven.

407
00:55:22.716 --> 00:55:25.346
He was a model for us all.

408
00:55:25.372 --> 00:55:27.845
A gorilla to remember.

409
00:55:28.383 --> 00:55:30.880
Hunter, warrior...

410
00:55:31.006 --> 00:55:32.974
defender of the Faith...

411
00:55:34.405 --> 00:55:38.465
cherished husband, beloved father...

412
00:55:38.491 --> 00:55:41.169
generous master.
Yes.

413
00:55:42.444 --> 00:55:46.089
He was a font
of simian kindness.

414
00:55:47.383 --> 00:55:50.782
The dear departed once said to me.

415
00:55:51.279 --> 00:55:54.503
"I never met
an ape I didn't like".

416
00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.206
Look! It's a man!

417
00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:00.668
In Heaven's name,
get rid of that creature!

418
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:03.202
Catch him! Ah!...

419
00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:07.675
Catch him! Catch him!

420
00:57:37.767 --> 00:57:39.333
Come on, Quintus.

421
00:59:51.836 --> 00:59:55.734
Go get him.
Taylor, why did you run away?

422
00:59:55.873 --> 00:59:58.181
Security police.
I'm in charge of this man.

423
00:59:58.207 --> 01:00:01.107
No longer, madam. He's now
in the custody of the Ministry of Science.

424
01:00:01.774 --> 01:00:06.668
Take your stinking paws
off me, you damn dirty ape.

425
01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.234
No one will listen to me.

426
01:00:20.915 --> 01:00:22.268
Only you.

427
01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:29.737
You... Nova

428
01:00:31.151 --> 01:00:34.618
You Nova. No.

429
01:00:37.739 --> 01:00:39.934
Yeah, me Tarzan, you Jane.

430
01:00:48.727 --> 01:00:50.127
Wait! What are you doing?

431
01:00:50.952 --> 01:00:53.482
Leave her alone, damn you!

432
01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.955
Where are you taking her.

433
01:01:00.301 --> 01:01:01.430
You.

434
01:01:05.006 --> 01:01:07.438
Where are you taking her?

435
01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:23.763
Damn you, you hairy scum!

436
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:26.344
Shut up, you freak!

437
01:01:26.622 --> 01:01:29.631
Julius, you.
I said shut up!

438
01:01:29.657 --> 01:01:32.020
It's a madhouse!

439
01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:35.056
A madhouse!

440
01:01:37.469 --> 01:01:38.550
Ah!...

441
01:01:46.846 --> 01:01:48.616
Now I don't even have you.

442
01:01:50.394 --> 01:01:54.780
Imagine me needing someone.
Back on Earth I never did.

443
01:01:54.806 --> 01:01:57.062
Oh, there were women,
lots of women.

444
01:01:57.088 --> 01:02:00.259
Lots of lovemaking, but no love.

445
01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:03.307
That was the kind of world
we'd made.

446
01:02:03.746 --> 01:02:08.155
So I left because there
was no one to hold me there.

447
01:02:08.233 --> 01:02:13.196
Did I tell you about Stewart?
Now there was a lovely girl.

448
01:02:13.366 --> 01:02:15.795
The most precious cargo
we brought along.

449
01:02:15.821 --> 01:02:19.847
She was to be the new Eve...

450
01:02:19.942 --> 01:02:23.539
with our hot and eager help,
of course.

451
01:02:25.456 --> 01:02:28.428
Probably just as well
she didn't make it this far.

452
01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:33.874
Do you love me, I wonder?

453
01:02:34.730 --> 01:02:37.232
Can you love, I wonder?

454
01:02:44.276 --> 01:02:48.638
Yeah. You're not as smart
as Stewart...

455
01:02:49.546 --> 01:02:51.482
but you're the only girl in town.

456
01:02:57.322 --> 01:03:01.848
Look at that.
I taught you to smile.

457
01:04:26.828 --> 01:04:28.885
It's been weeks.
What happened?

458
01:04:29.318 --> 01:04:32.064
here have you been?
Why didn't you come see me? Shh!

459
01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:34.662
What is this?
A hearing.

460
01:04:34.688 --> 01:04:37.176
Be clever. Be quiet.
All rise!

461
01:04:46.943 --> 01:04:48.268
Be seated.

462
01:04:51.326 --> 01:04:54.936
This ad hoc tribunal of the
National Academy is now in session.

463
01:04:54.962 --> 01:04:57.366
President
of the Academy presiding.

464
01:04:57.550 --> 01:05:01.877
On my right, Dr. Maximus,
Commissioner for Animal Affairs.

465
01:05:01.903 --> 01:05:03.579
And on my left, Dr. Zaius,

466
01:05:03.711 --> 01:05:07.222
Minister of Science
and chief defender of the Faith.

467
01:05:07.418 --> 01:05:11.754
And appearing for the state, Dr. Honorious,
Deputy Minister of Justice.

468
01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:19.932
Bailiff! You had instructions
to clean up the beast.

469
01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:23.561
All these rags he's wearing
give off a stench...

470
01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:26.578
that's offensive to the dignity
of this tribunal.

471
01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.623
You may proceed, Dr. Honorious.

472
01:05:39.742 --> 01:05:42.413
By your leave,
Mr. President, this tribunal...

473
01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.920
has not yet defined the purpose
for this inquiry.

474
01:05:48.064 --> 01:05:51.400
You asked for the opportunity
to present your case.

475
01:05:51.426 --> 01:05:53.608
Surely you must know
why you're here.

476
01:05:53.634 --> 01:05:58.779
At the very least, this man has the right
to know whether there's a charge against him.

477
01:05:58.805 --> 01:06:02.942
Objection!
This exhibit is indeed a man.

478
01:06:02.968 --> 01:06:05.649
Therefore, he has no rights
under Ape Law.

479
01:06:06.392 --> 01:06:09.666
Well, Dr. Zira, this is a man,
is it not?

480
01:06:09.692 --> 01:06:13.331
He is unlike any man
you have ever seen,

481
01:06:13.526 --> 01:06:15.321
as we hope to prove.

482
01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:18.860
Answer the question, Dr. Zira.
Is it a man?

483
01:06:18.886 --> 01:06:22.677
Uh, sir, perhaps the question
is the point at issue.

484
01:06:22.963 --> 01:06:27.614
Is he a man? Is he a deviate
or a freak of nature?

485
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.403
Objection. Sustained.

486
01:06:30.429 --> 01:06:34.277
Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness,
you must admit...

487
01:06:34.303 --> 01:06:36.071
that the accused is an ape

488
01:06:36.097 --> 01:06:38.850
and therefore has,
no rights under Ape Law.

489
01:06:38.876 --> 01:06:41.250
Then why is he called
"the accused"?

490
01:06:41.412 --> 01:06:44.201
Your Honors must think him guilty
of something.

491
01:06:46.577 --> 01:06:50.729
Creature's not being tried,
he's being disposed of.

492
01:06:51.033 --> 01:06:55.286
It is scientific heresy
that is being tried here.

493
01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:59.431
Well put, Dr. Zaius.
Let us warn our friends...

494
01:06:59.457 --> 01:07:03.585
that they endanger their own careers
by defending this animal.

495
01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.572
Then I'll defend myself.

496
01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:16.195
Dr. Zira, would you tell...
Bright Eyes to be quiet?

497
01:07:16.221 --> 01:07:19.387
My name is Taylor.
Bailiff! Silence the animal.

498
01:07:20.372 --> 01:07:21.936
Wait, let me.

499
01:07:24.746 --> 01:07:26.801
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

500
01:07:27.301 --> 01:07:30.678
Learned judges,
my case is simple.

501
01:07:31.044 --> 01:07:33.535
It is based on
our First Article of Faith.

502
01:07:33.768 --> 01:07:37.100
That the Almighty created
the ape in his own image.

503
01:07:37.204 --> 01:07:39.297
That he gave him a soul
and a mind.

504
01:07:39.515 --> 01:07:42.282
That he set him apart
from the beasts of the jungle...

505
01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.167
and made him
the lord of the planet.

506
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.667
These sacred truths
are self-evident.

507
01:07:48.543 --> 01:07:51.474
The proper study of apes is apes.

508
01:07:53.059 --> 01:07:56.801
But certain young cynics
have chosen to study man.

509
01:07:57.124 --> 01:07:58.129
Yes.

510
01:07:58.155 --> 01:08:03.345
Perverted scientists who advance,
an insidious theory called evolution.

511
01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:06.275
Come to the point, Dr. Honorious.

512
01:08:06.404 --> 01:08:11.162
The state charges that Dr. Zira
and a corrupt surgeon named Galen...

513
01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:13.517
experimented
on this wounded animal...

514
01:08:13.543 --> 01:08:16.312
tampering with his brain
and throat tissues...

515
01:08:16.557 --> 01:08:19.987
to produce a speaking monster.
That's a lie!

516
01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:25.000
Mind your tongue, madam.
Did we create his mind, as well?

517
01:08:25.156 --> 01:08:30.283
Not only can this man speak,
he can think. He can reason.

518
01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:33.975
That can reason?

519
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:36.635
With the tribunal's permission,

520
01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:40.152
allow me to expose this
hoax by direct examination.

521
01:08:40.178 --> 01:08:43.600
Proceed, Doctor, but do not turn
this hearing into a farce.

522
01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:54.947
Tell the court, Bright Eyes,
what is the Second Article of Faith?

523
01:08:56.333 --> 01:08:59.436
I know nothing of your culture.
I, I admit that.

524
01:08:59.462 --> 01:09:03.016
Of course he doesn't know our culture
because he cannot think.

525
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:08.686
Tell us, why are all apes
created equal?

526
01:09:10.285 --> 01:09:13.707
Some apes, it seems,
are more equal than others. Ridiculous.

527
01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:17.854
Tell us, Bright Eyes,
why do men have no souls?

528
01:09:17.943 --> 01:09:21.886
What is the proof that a divine spark
exists in the simian brain?

529
01:09:22.042 --> 01:09:23.200
Huh?

530
01:09:32.133 --> 01:09:33.602
Read this for me.

531
01:09:43.948 --> 01:09:48.214
Since the defendant has been forbidden
to speak in his own defense...

532
01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.277
he requests that the, uh, following
statement be read into the record.

533
01:09:53.303 --> 01:09:56.166
You, Dr. Cornelius.
Read it.

534
01:09:57.536 --> 01:09:58.619
Yeah.

535
01:09:59.886 --> 01:10:02.038
"I have come to you...

536
01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:04.941
"from a planet
in a different solar system.

537
01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:07.146
"I am an explorer in space".

538
01:10:07.172 --> 01:10:09.040
Stop right there.
Let me see that paper.

539
01:10:17.315 --> 01:10:21.273
It's a joke...
in very poor taste.

540
01:10:21.299 --> 01:10:24.627
Is it a joke to seek the truth
about this man?

541
01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:28.635
Dr. Zira, you state here that a ship
from outer space...

542
01:10:28.661 --> 01:10:31.441
sank in an inland sea
of our eastern desert.

543
01:10:31.467 --> 01:10:35.136
You also state that Bright Eyes
had two intelligent companions...

544
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:39.216
with him at the time of his capture.
That is his assertion.

545
01:10:40.073 --> 01:10:43.578
Mr. President,
in addition to Bright Eyes...

546
01:10:43.604 --> 01:10:46.745
I believe the prosecutor
has reassembled...

547
01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:50.487
all the surviving humans
that were captured in the hunt.

548
01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:53.536
That's true, Dr. Zaius.
Very well.

549
01:10:54.279 --> 01:10:57.745
Then I suggest
that we go take a look at them.

550
01:11:36.298 --> 01:11:38.241
That's him! That's Landon.

551
01:11:38.267 --> 01:11:41.172
Which one?
The tall one in the back.

552
01:11:43.335 --> 01:11:46.753
Do you acknowledge kinship
with any of these creatures?

553
01:11:46.779 --> 01:11:50.576
With one them' yes.
Identify him then. Speak to him.

554
01:11:52.299 --> 01:11:53.356
Landon?

555
01:11:55.663 --> 01:11:56.850
Landon?

556
01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.715
Oh, they cut him.

557
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:09.043
Did you know about this?

558
01:12:09.296 --> 01:12:13.093
No. I swear.
I never saw this man before.

559
01:12:13.418 --> 01:12:14.616
But they.

560
01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:17.950
You did it.

561
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:21.819
You cut up his brain,
you bloody baboon!

562
01:12:21.857 --> 01:12:22.914
Stop him!

563
01:12:35.642 --> 01:12:36.980
Take him inside!

564
01:13:18.341 --> 01:13:21.000
Mr. President,
a word of explanation.

565
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:24.683
The human specimen
you saw outside...

566
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:27.749
suffered a skull fracture
in the course of the hunt.

567
01:13:27.943 --> 01:13:30.229
Two fine veterinary surgeons,

568
01:13:30.255 --> 01:13:33.079
under my direction were
able to save his life.

569
01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:36.363
But the beast could not
speak, of course.

570
01:13:36.389 --> 01:13:38.141
Nor will he ever speak.

571
01:13:38.176 --> 01:13:41.652
You did that to him, damn you!
You cut out his memory!

572
01:13:41.678 --> 01:13:44.105
You took his identity,
and that's what you want to do to me!

573
01:13:44.131 --> 01:13:46.263
Bailiff, gag the animal!

574
01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:49.720
Damn you! For me...

575
01:13:51.276 --> 01:13:54.136
May it please the tribunal,
I for one grant you...

576
01:13:54.162 --> 01:13:56.483
that this creature cannot have come
from another planet.

577
01:13:56.509 --> 01:13:58.197
But this much is certain.

578
01:13:58.328 --> 01:14:00.886
He does come from somewhere
in the Forbidden Zone.

579
01:14:00.912 --> 01:14:04.393
He's described the region to us
and described it accurately, for...

580
01:14:04.419 --> 01:14:05.597
I have been there.

581
01:14:05.623 --> 01:14:08.924
You've visited the Forbidden Zone?
Yes, sir.

582
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:11.853
A year ago- with the special
permission of the Academy.

583
01:14:11.879 --> 01:14:13.460
He exceeded his orders.

584
01:14:13.486 --> 01:14:16.284
His travel permit
was canceled immediately.

585
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:18.343
Yes, sir' that is true.
Thanks to you.

586
01:14:18.369 --> 01:14:21.670
But not before
I discovered evidence...

587
01:14:21.696 --> 01:14:24.087
of a simian culture
that existed long

588
01:14:24.113 --> 01:14:25.977
before the Sacred
Scrolls were written.

589
01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:29.622
Objection! These remarks
are profane and irrelevant.

590
01:14:29.648 --> 01:14:33.318
Sustained. Your archaeological theories
have no bearing...

591
01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:35.345
on the disposition
of this creature.

592
01:14:35.371 --> 01:14:38.547
Let them talk, Mr. President.
Let them talk.

593
01:14:38.855 --> 01:14:43.736
Sirs, our theories have
a bearing on his identity.

594
01:14:43.762 --> 01:14:44.887
How so?

595
01:14:45.156 --> 01:14:48.833
Let us assume,
as common sense dictates...

596
01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:51.554
that the prisoner's story
is false.

597
01:14:51.884 --> 01:14:55.001
But if he did not come
from another planet...

598
01:14:55.336 --> 01:14:58.658
then surely
he sprang from our own.

599
01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:01.687
Yes, sprang!

600
01:15:01.713 --> 01:15:06.003
As an animal psychologist,
I have found no physiological defect...

601
01:15:06.029 --> 01:15:08.610
to explain why humans are mute.

602
01:15:08.636 --> 01:15:10.667
Objection! Sustained!

603
01:15:10.693 --> 01:15:12.735
Their speech organs
are adequate.

604
01:15:12.761 --> 01:15:15.980
The flaw lies not in anatomy,
but in the brain.

605
01:15:16.006 --> 01:15:17.923
Objection! Sustained!

606
01:15:17.949 --> 01:15:21.592
Sustain all objections,
but face the truth.

607
01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:26.398
Yes. Behold this marvel,
this living paradox.

608
01:15:26.424 --> 01:15:28.967
This missing link
in an evolutionary chain.

609
01:15:28.993 --> 01:15:32.330
Silence! You go too far!

610
01:15:32.356 --> 01:15:35.702
I think an indictment is in order.
Yes, sir.

611
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:39.885
The state charges Dr. Zira and Cornelius
with contempt of this tribunal...

612
01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:42.545
malicious mischief
and scientific heresy.

613
01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:43.841
It's so ordered.

614
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:47.788
This tribunal will examine
all the evidence presented here...

615
01:15:47.814 --> 01:15:51.399
and in due course, render its verdict
as to the proposed indictment...

616
01:15:51.628 --> 01:15:56.114
and as to the disposition
of the deviate in question.

617
01:15:56.659 --> 01:15:58.349
This hearing is adjourned.

618
01:16:45.749 --> 01:16:47.216
Wait outside.

619
01:16:58.479 --> 01:17:01.001
Well, the verdict is in.

620
01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:05.047
At the moment,
your two simian friends...

621
01:17:05.073 --> 01:17:08.025
and sponsors
are free on bail.

622
01:17:08.072 --> 01:17:11.288
But they'll soon
be brought to trial for heresy.

623
01:17:11.955 --> 01:17:16.280
What about me? Oh!...
Your case was preordained.

624
01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:19.748
In a way, you did
the state a service...

625
01:17:19.803 --> 01:17:24.865
because you made it possible
for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.

626
01:17:25.019 --> 01:17:28.977
Now the tribunal
has placed you in my custody...

627
01:17:29.003 --> 01:17:30.868
for final disposition.

628
01:17:32.406 --> 01:17:34.550
You realize what that means?

629
01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:39.102
No.
Emasculation, to begin with.

630
01:17:39.665 --> 01:17:44.309
Then experimental surgery
on the speech centers- on the brain.

631
01:17:44.722 --> 01:17:47.269
Eventually, a kind of living death.

632
01:17:50.034 --> 01:17:51.189
However...

633
01:17:53.549 --> 01:17:56.337
I have it in my power
to grant a reprieve.

634
01:17:57.137 --> 01:17:59.654
That is why I summoned you
here tonight.

635
01:18:01.363 --> 01:18:05.783
Tell me who you are, what you
it really is and where it came from...

636
01:18:05.809 --> 01:18:08.003
and no veterinary
shall touch you.

637
01:18:08.029 --> 01:18:11.794
I told you that at that
hearing of yours. You lied!

638
01:18:12.995 --> 01:18:16.481
Where is your tribe?
My tribe.

639
01:18:17.001 --> 01:18:20.494
They live on another planet
in another solar system.

640
01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.805
Even in your lies,
some truth slips through.

641
01:18:24.381 --> 01:18:28.547
That mythical community you're supposed
to come from, Fort Wayne.

642
01:18:28.573 --> 01:18:30.416
What about it?
A fort!

643
01:18:31.798 --> 01:18:35.198
Unconsciously, you chose
a name that was belligerent.

644
01:18:35.341 --> 01:18:37.168
Where were you nurtured?

645
01:18:38.068 --> 01:18:42.113
Then you don't believe
that prosecutor's charge...

646
01:18:42.139 --> 01:18:45.250
that I am a monster was
created by Dr. Zira?

647
01:18:45.276 --> 01:18:46.746
Certainly not.

648
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:51.679
Uh, you're a mutant.

649
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:55.897
That's what Zira and Cornelius claim.
You're talking heresy, Doctor.

650
01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:59.287
Hmph. Of course.
Well, suppose I am a mutant?

651
01:18:59.722 --> 01:19:03.630
How can the appearance
of one mutant send you into a panic?

652
01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:07.103
Because you're not unique.
There's the one you call Landon.

653
01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:10.745
Oh, then you admit that.
I admit that where there's one mutant...

654
01:19:10.771 --> 01:19:14.616
there’s probably another, another
and another, an entire nest of them

655
01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:18.174
Where is your nest, Taylor?

656
01:19:18.783 --> 01:19:21.602
Where are your women?
Thank you.

657
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:26.204
Thank you for calling me
Taylor, Dr. Zaius.

658
01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:30.802
I know who I am.
But who are you...

659
01:19:30.836 --> 01:19:35.245
and how in hell did this upside-down
civilization get started?

660
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:38.768
Ah!... You may well
call it upside-down...

661
01:19:38.794 --> 01:19:42.717
since you occupy its lowest level
and deservedly so.

662
01:19:45.563 --> 01:19:48.903
Our eastern desert
has never been explored...

663
01:19:49.264 --> 01:19:53.301
because we've always assumed
that life cannot exist there.

664
01:19:53.746 --> 01:19:56.727
Taylor, save yourself.

665
01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:02.222
Tell me, is there another jungle
beyond the Forbidden Zone?

666
01:20:02.248 --> 01:20:03.667
I don't know.

667
01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:07.333
If you're trying to protect
others of your kind,

668
01:20:07.359 --> 01:20:09.362
it'll cost you your identity.

669
01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.143
I'm not protecting anyone.

670
01:20:11.366 --> 01:20:14.407
This whole thing is insane.
What have I done?

671
01:20:20.303 --> 01:20:25.283
You are a menace.
A walking pestilence.

672
01:20:25.545 --> 01:20:28.085
I do know
who you are, Taylor.

673
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:33.205
I'll give you just six hours
to make a full confession.

674
01:20:33.982 --> 01:20:38.027
After that, I shall use surgery
to obtain one. Guards!

675
01:20:38.069 --> 01:20:41.558
All right' you can cut pieces out of me.
You've got the power.

676
01:20:41.584 --> 01:20:43.922
Return this creature
to his cage.

677
01:20:43.948 --> 01:20:46.051
But you do it out of fear.
Remember that!

678
01:20:46.077 --> 01:20:49.126
Remember that!
Because you're afraid of me!

679
01:20:49.152 --> 01:20:50.768
What are you afraid of, Doctor?

680
01:21:13.428 --> 01:21:15.929
Are you Julius?
Who are you?

681
01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:18.527
I'm from the office
of Animal Affairs.

682
01:21:21.604 --> 01:21:24.219
That male is to be
transferred to the zoo.

683
01:21:24.397 --> 01:21:27.677
At this hour?
Who says so?

684
01:21:27.821 --> 01:21:29.738
Don't they tell you anything?

685
01:21:30.223 --> 01:21:33.694
The Antivivisectionist
Society is up in arms.

686
01:21:34.106 --> 01:21:37.242
They're gonna save this beast
from those butchers in the lab.

687
01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.563
If he can speak,
he belongs in the public zoo.

688
01:21:41.589 --> 01:21:42.970
But what'll probably happen

689
01:21:42.996 --> 01:21:45.495
is that some money-mad grown-up
will put him in a circus.

690
01:21:45.521 --> 01:21:47.799
Then we'll have to pay
to see what rightfully.

691
01:21:47.825 --> 01:21:50.194
Stop making speeches...
and show me the order.

692
01:22:05.562 --> 01:22:08.248
Ah, this order's no good.

693
01:22:09.139 --> 01:22:11.966
It must be countersigned
by Dr. Zaius.

694
01:22:12.735 --> 01:22:13.801
Grab him!

695
01:22:19.891 --> 01:22:24.539
Who are you? So you can talk.
I'm Dr. Zira's nephew.

696
01:22:24.758 --> 01:22:28.499
This abduction was her idea.
You're not really going to the zoo.

697
01:22:28.525 --> 01:22:32.036
That's just our story in case
somebody stops us. Get me out of this.

698
01:22:35.536 --> 01:22:37.071
We've gotta move fast.

699
01:22:40.483 --> 01:22:43.800
She comes along too.
Zira doesn't want your female.

700
01:22:43.826 --> 01:22:44.871
I want her.

701
01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:47.645
If you insist.

702
01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:50.665
But I'm not taking any orders.
All right. Come on. Let's go.

703
01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:17.688
I told you not to bring the other one!
He wouldn't leave her.

704
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:19.737
Oh, all right. Come on!

705
01:23:28.141 --> 01:23:31.141
Here, put this on. Come on.
Don't you have any clothes for me?

706
01:23:31.167 --> 01:23:33.936
What do you expect,
an ape's new suit?

707
01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.738
This stuff stinks.
Well, so do you, like all men.

708
01:23:38.184 --> 01:23:42.575
Taylor, remember,
all men look alike to most apes.

709
01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:44.093
So put it on and keep quiet,

710
01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:46.728
and we may just get away
with this. Hurry!

711
01:24:37.782 --> 01:24:39.023
Cornelius!

712
01:24:48.808 --> 01:24:51.516
How'd it go? Hey!...

713
01:24:52.412 --> 01:24:55.513
Come on.
Let me out of this.

714
01:25:04.785 --> 01:25:07.249
Well, Taylor,
we're all fugitives now.

715
01:25:07.814 --> 01:25:09.947
Do you have any weapons,
any guns?

716
01:25:10.163 --> 01:25:12.240
The best.
But we won't need them.

717
01:25:12.359 --> 01:25:13.642
I'm glad to hear it.

718
01:25:13.679 --> 01:25:15.116
I want one anyway.

719
01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:26.300
Now look here, Taylor'
I'm in charge of this expedition.

720
01:25:26.326 --> 01:25:29.141
Good for you.
But you're not in charge of me.

721
01:25:29.167 --> 01:25:32.262
Not anymore.
I don't plan to be caught again.

722
01:25:34.385 --> 01:25:36.089
As you wish.

723
01:25:36.115 --> 01:25:39.943
Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was
another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone.

724
01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:42.807
I'll try for that.
What about you?

725
01:25:43.184 --> 01:25:45.931
Cornelius and I
have been indicted for heresy.

726
01:25:45.978 --> 01:25:49.369
Unless we can prove our theories,
we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

727
01:25:49.689 --> 01:25:51.536
You're going back
to the Forbidden Zone?

728
01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:54.861
We're going back to the diggings
I worked at over a year ago.

729
01:25:54.963 --> 01:25:57.603
It's a three-day ride
across the desert...

730
01:25:57.839 --> 01:26:01.077
and near the place where you claim
you landed from that planet of yours.

731
01:26:01.103 --> 01:26:02.712
Still don't believe me, do you?

732
01:26:03.009 --> 01:26:05.636
It's a long detour to Dead Lake.
What would we find?

733
01:26:05.663 --> 01:26:09.066
Nothing much.
An empty rubber life raft.

734
01:26:09.217 --> 01:26:10.643
Maybe a little flag...

735
01:26:10.889 --> 01:26:12.789
the emblem of my countrymen.

736
01:26:14.014 --> 01:26:16.243
The terrain around
that lake is poisonous.

737
01:26:16.269 --> 01:26:19.144
There's no fresh water,
no vegetation, nothing.

738
01:26:23.045 --> 01:26:26.380
Anyway, I ought to
thank you for saving me.

739
01:26:26.406 --> 01:26:27.836
You'll be in trouble for that.

740
01:26:29.368 --> 01:26:32.584
We've been in trouble
since the moment we met you.

741
01:26:36.538 --> 01:26:37.975
What's she pointing at?

742
01:26:38.372 --> 01:26:40.694
This must be close to home for her.
She knows it.

743
01:26:45.212 --> 01:26:49.495
Nova, no. Nova. Nova!
You can't go there.

744
01:26:49.521 --> 01:26:51.299
It's not safe. Nova.

745
01:26:55.133 --> 01:26:56.711
We better get started.

746
01:26:56.737 --> 01:26:59.672
If the mounted police pick up our trail,
they'll come this far at least.

747
01:26:59.698 --> 01:27:02.267
Right. Let's get the water
and provisions into the wagon.

748
01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.591
Cornelius.

749
01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.255
Where does this river lead to?

750
01:28:23.347 --> 01:28:25.839
It flows into a sea
some miles from here.

751
01:28:25.865 --> 01:28:29.406
That's where we'll find the diggings.
And beyond that?

752
01:28:29.787 --> 01:28:33.891
I don't know. You can't ride along
the shore at high tide...

753
01:28:33.917 --> 01:28:36.974
and we had no boats
on our last expedition.

754
01:28:37.293 --> 01:28:41.102
You never told me, why do you call
this a Forbidden Zone?

755
01:28:41.628 --> 01:28:45.027
No one knows.
It's an ancient taboo...

756
01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:47.452
set forth in the Sacred Scrolls.

757
01:28:47.478 --> 01:28:50.643
The Lawgiver pronounced
this whole area deadly.

758
01:28:52.728 --> 01:28:56.943
Shouldn't we be moving on?
I'm for that.

759
01:30:26.279 --> 01:30:27.732
There, do you like it?

760
01:30:33.370 --> 01:30:36.255
Why did you do that,
scrape off your hair?

761
01:30:36.281 --> 01:30:40.531
In my world when I left it,
only kids your age wore beards.

762
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:44.252
Beards?
I don't go in for fads.

763
01:30:45.295 --> 01:30:50.117
Somehow... it makes you
look less intelligent.

764
01:30:51.726 --> 01:30:53.804
When will you show me
what's in that cave?

765
01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:55.596
Right now, if you like.

766
01:31:15.591 --> 01:31:16.915
Cornelius!

767
01:31:27.699 --> 01:31:31.191
Lucius, don't fire at them.
You're all under arrest.

768
01:31:35.154 --> 01:31:38.985
If there's any more shooting,
Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go.

769
01:31:39.011 --> 01:31:42.344
You can count on it!
Taylor, you are not in command here.

770
01:31:42.372 --> 01:31:44.005
Put down that gun.
Shut up!

771
01:31:44.464 --> 01:31:48.079
Very well.
Lower your weapons.

772
01:31:48.238 --> 01:31:51.200
Tell them to pull back
around the rocks. Out of range.

773
01:31:52.524 --> 01:31:53.917
Withdraw!

774
01:32:00.354 --> 01:32:02.941
How did you know we'd come here?
It wasn't difficult.

775
01:32:02.967 --> 01:32:05.968
Only an apostate
would flee to the Forbidden Zone.

776
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:09.496
And only a fool would give
a gun to an animal.

777
01:32:10.487 --> 01:32:13.723
I see you've brought
the female of your species.

778
01:32:13.749 --> 01:32:17.505
I didn't realize
that man could be monogamous.

779
01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:19.802
On this planet, it's easy.

780
01:32:21.454 --> 01:32:25.178
I'll ask you to reconsider
the rash course you've undertaken.

781
01:32:25.204 --> 01:32:29.581
If you’re convicted of heresy,
the most you'll get is two years.

782
01:32:29.607 --> 01:32:33.533
But, if you persist in
pointing guns in my direction,

783
01:32:33.559 --> 01:32:35.352
you'll hang for high treason.

784
01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.253
We never meant
to be treasonous, sir.

785
01:32:38.563 --> 01:32:42.343
But up there in the face of that cliff,
there is a vast cave...

786
01:32:42.478 --> 01:32:46.497
and in that cave a fabulous treasure
of fossils and artifacts.

787
01:32:46.523 --> 01:32:49.939
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts.
They're worth.

788
01:32:49.965 --> 01:32:52.123
There's your Minister of Science...

789
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:55.527
honor-bound to expand
the frontiers of knowledge.

790
01:32:55.553 --> 01:32:56.572
Taylor, please!

791
01:32:56.598 --> 01:32:58.839
Except that he's also chief
defender of the Faith.

792
01:32:58.865 --> 01:33:02.554
There is no contradiction
between faith and science.

793
01:33:02.676 --> 01:33:03.936
True science.

794
01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:06.139
Are you willing to put
that statement to the test?

795
01:33:06.165 --> 01:33:07.437
Taylor, I would much rather.

796
01:33:07.463 --> 01:33:09.935
Take it easy.
You saved me from this fanatic.

797
01:33:09.961 --> 01:33:11.761
Maybe I can return the favor.

798
01:33:12.303 --> 01:33:14.035
What is your proposal?

799
01:33:14.799 --> 01:33:17.674
When were those Sacred Scrolls
of yours written?

800
01:33:17.818 --> 01:33:20.704
Twelve hundred years ago.
All right.

801
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:23.391
Now, if they can prove
those scrolls don't tell

802
01:33:23.417 --> 01:33:25.089
the whole truth
of your history...

803
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:28.165
if they can find some real evidence
of another culture...

804
01:33:28.191 --> 01:33:31.084
from some remote past,
will you let them off?

805
01:33:31.449 --> 01:33:34.349
Of course.
Let's go up to the cave.

806
01:33:39.667 --> 01:33:42.544
Sorry, Lucius, you've got to stay here
and guard the camp.

807
01:33:42.570 --> 01:33:45.866
Always giving orders,
just like every other adult.

808
01:33:45.892 --> 01:33:48.636
Relax, you'll get
to see it all later on.

809
01:34:51.008 --> 01:34:53.328
Present your evidence, Cornelius.

810
01:34:53.476 --> 01:34:58.401
It was at this level that I discovered
traces of an early ape creature,

811
01:34:58.512 --> 01:35:01.176
a stage of primitive barbarism,
really,

812
01:35:01.202 --> 01:35:04.051
dating back some 1,300 years,
roughly.

813
01:35:04.367 --> 01:35:10.074
It was at this level I discovered
cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz...

814
01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:13.351
and the fossilized bones
of carnivorous gorillas.

815
01:35:14.299 --> 01:35:18.600
But the artifacts lying here...

816
01:35:20.202 --> 01:35:23.442
were found at this level...

817
01:35:23.755 --> 01:35:26.605
and date back,
uh, 700 years earlier.

818
01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:28.706
That's the paradox.

819
01:35:28.817 --> 01:35:32.028
For the more ancient culture
is the more advanced.

820
01:35:32.158 --> 01:35:36.063
Now, admittedly,
many of these objects are unidentified.

821
01:35:36.089 --> 01:35:39.986
But clearly, they were fashioned
by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.

822
01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:44.910
Indeed, the fact that many
of these tools are unknown to us...

823
01:35:44.936 --> 01:35:49.410
suggests a culture which,
in certain ways, equals our own.

824
01:35:49.478 --> 01:35:52.233
Some of the evidence
is uncontestable.

825
01:35:52.259 --> 01:35:56.053
Don't speak to me in absolutes.
The evidence is contestable.

826
01:35:57.258 --> 01:36:00.170
I apologize, sir.
To begin with...

827
01:36:00.196 --> 01:36:03.070
your methods of dating
the past are crude, to say the least.

828
01:36:03.096 --> 01:36:07.093
There are geologists on my staff
who'd laugh at your speculations.

829
01:36:07.202 --> 01:36:10.124
But there's the doll, sir.
What?

830
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:14.555
Oh, uh, lying right there.
The human doll.

831
01:36:20.834 --> 01:36:22.141
What does this prove?

832
01:36:22.167 --> 01:36:25.334
My granddaughter plays
with human dolls.

833
01:36:26.530 --> 01:36:29.711
The doll was found
beside the jawbone of a man...

834
01:36:29.737 --> 01:36:33.388
and no trace of simian fossil
has been found in this deposit.

835
01:36:33.414 --> 01:36:35.601
Your conclusion is premature.

836
01:36:35.627 --> 01:36:39.287
Have you forgotten your scripture?
The 13th Scroll?

837
01:36:39.476 --> 01:36:42.484
"And Proteus brought
the upright beast into the garden...

838
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:46.191
and chained him to a tree,
and the children did make sport of him".

839
01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:48.008
No, sir,
I have not forgotten.

840
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:50.521
Well, for a time, the ancients

841
01:36:50.547 --> 01:36:53.055
kept humans as household pets...

842
01:36:53.081 --> 01:36:56.969
until our Lawgiver proved
that man could not be tamed.

843
01:36:58.031 --> 01:36:59.705
Keep digging' Cornelius.

844
01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:05.451
You'll find evidence
of the master of this house, an ape.

845
01:37:09.581 --> 01:37:14.068
What are you doing?
Reconstructing a past life.

846
01:37:16.122 --> 01:37:19.133
You say these things were
found at the same level as that doll?

847
01:37:20.153 --> 01:37:22.780
Whoever owned him
must have been in pretty bad shape.

848
01:37:22.842 --> 01:37:27.734
He wore false teeth
and eyeglasses.

849
01:37:28.568 --> 01:37:30.605
He had a failing heart.

850
01:37:31.948 --> 01:37:37.126
Towards the end he had
this prefabricated valve put in it.

851
01:37:38.523 --> 01:37:42.226
I don't say he was a man
like I knew at home...

852
01:37:42.464 --> 01:37:45.838
but he must have been a close relative
because he had all the same weaknesses.

853
01:37:46.037 --> 01:37:50.089
He was a weak, fragile animal.

854
01:37:50.839 --> 01:37:54.955
But he was here before you,
and he was better than you are.

855
01:37:54.981 --> 01:37:59.054
That's lunacy.
I can offer alternate descriptions...

856
01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:03.915
of every one of those articles
which is just as ingenious as yours.

857
01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:06.730
But it'd be conjecture.
Not proof.

858
01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:08.401
Mommy.

859
01:38:15.505 --> 01:38:17.337
Mommy.

860
01:38:20.077 --> 01:38:26.424
Dr. Zaius, would an ape
make a human doll that talks?

861
01:38:30.474 --> 01:38:31.627
Lucius!

862
01:38:34.661 --> 01:38:37.538
You dirty. Nova!

863
01:38:58.864 --> 01:39:00.035
Nova!

864
01:39:37.125 --> 01:39:40.711
Cornelius. Zira.

865
01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:42.538
Help me.

866
01:39:44.275 --> 01:39:47.105
Help!... Mommy.

867
01:39:53.668 --> 01:39:57.003
I ought to kill you right now.
Come on.

868
01:39:58.790 --> 01:40:00.941
You tell him to pull back now!

869
01:40:01.007 --> 01:40:03.742
Cease fire! Withdraw!

870
01:40:05.845 --> 01:40:08.707
Up there. Withdraw!

871
01:40:11.483 --> 01:40:12.671
Get down.

872
01:40:26.804 --> 01:40:28.337
Lucius, are you all right?

873
01:40:28.932 --> 01:40:31.003
They took me by surprise.

874
01:40:31.367 --> 01:40:34.635
Sneaked up on me
while I was feeding the horses.

875
01:40:35.104 --> 01:40:36.953
What's happened to honor?

876
01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.893
I got off two rounds
to warn you.

877
01:40:41.102 --> 01:40:44.304
They've taken everything.
Not quite everything.

878
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:47.160
They left a hostage behind.

879
01:40:48.094 --> 01:40:50.564
How are you feeling?
Disillusioned.

880
01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:52.978
You can't trust
the older generation.

881
01:40:53.004 --> 01:40:54.365
I know what you mean.

882
01:40:55.258 --> 01:40:57.740
I want you to go around the rocks
and tell those gorillas...

883
01:40:57.766 --> 01:41:01.769
I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner.
Yes, I can do that.

884
01:41:01.806 --> 01:41:03.642
I want a horse, food and water.

885
01:41:03.668 --> 01:41:06.260
Enough for a week for me
and this female...

886
01:41:06.286 --> 01:41:08.307
and 50 rounds of ammunition.

887
01:41:08.646 --> 01:41:12.247
What if they won't agree to your terms?
Tell them I'll shoot him.

888
01:41:12.437 --> 01:41:16.363
Taylor, you can't.
Ah, yes, he can.

889
01:41:17.593 --> 01:41:21.011
He's a born killer.
Deliver the message.

890
01:41:23.558 --> 01:41:24.713
Over here.

891
01:41:29.544 --> 01:41:30.682
Sit down.

892
01:41:47.451 --> 01:41:51.256
Taylor, please.
Don't treat him like that.

893
01:41:51.498 --> 01:41:54.136
Why not?
It's humiliating.

894
01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:58.873
The way I was humiliated...
by all of you?

895
01:41:59.183 --> 01:42:01.180
You led me around on a leash.

896
01:42:01.206 --> 01:42:03.834
That was different.
We thought you were inferior.

897
01:42:03.947 --> 01:42:05.371
Now you know better.

898
01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:09.414
Cornelius was right, Doctor.
He proved it.

899
01:42:09.852 --> 01:42:13.691
Man was here first. You owe him
your science, your culture...

900
01:42:13.813 --> 01:42:16.939
whatever civilization you've got.
Then answer me this.

901
01:42:17.066 --> 01:42:21.094
If man was superior,
why didn't he survive?

902
01:42:21.177 --> 01:42:22.803
Wiped out by a plague.

903
01:42:22.829 --> 01:42:25.690
Some natural catastrophe,
a storm of meteors.

904
01:42:25.716 --> 01:42:28.841
From the looks of some parts of this planet,
I'd say that was a fair bet.

905
01:42:28.867 --> 01:42:32.068
But we can't be sure.
He is.

906
01:42:32.688 --> 01:42:34.075
He knew all the time.

907
01:42:34.101 --> 01:42:36.796
Long before you found your
caves, he knew.

908
01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:40.769
Defender of the Faith.
Guardian of the Terrible Secret.

909
01:42:40.795 --> 01:42:42.266
That's it, isn't it, Doctor?

910
01:42:42.292 --> 01:42:45.365
What I know of man was
written long ago...

911
01:42:45.391 --> 01:42:49.068
set down by the greatest ape
of all, our Lawgiver.

912
01:42:49.301 --> 01:42:51.318
Cornelius, come here.

913
01:42:52.517 --> 01:42:54.003
Reach into my pocket.

914
01:42:54.544 --> 01:42:59.077
Read to him
the 29th Scroll, sixth verse.

915
01:43:02.854 --> 01:43:07.235
"Beware the beast man,
for he is the devil's pawn.

916
01:43:07.473 --> 01:43:11.798
"Alone among God's primates,
he kills for sport...

917
01:43:11.909 --> 01:43:14.160
"or lust or greed.

918
01:43:15.187 --> 01:43:19.117
"Yea, he will murder his brother
to possess his brother's land.

919
01:43:19.838 --> 01:43:22.254
"Let him not breed
in great numbers...

920
01:43:22.321 --> 01:43:26.573
"for he will make a desert
of his home and yours.

921
01:43:26.724 --> 01:43:27.901
"Shun him.

922
01:43:28.542 --> 01:43:31.334
Drive him back into
his jungle lair...

923
01:43:31.666 --> 01:43:34.400
for he is the harbinger of death".

924
01:43:36.703 --> 01:43:40.213
I found nothing in the cave
to alter that conception of man...

925
01:43:40.239 --> 01:43:42.601
and I still live by its injunction.

926
01:43:51.888 --> 01:43:53.457
That's far enough.

927
01:44:00.486 --> 01:44:02.770
They think
you're behaving foolishly.

928
01:44:04.013 --> 01:44:07.674
I must say I agree.
Where will you go?

929
01:44:08.273 --> 01:44:11.365
To start with,
I'll follow the shoreline and my nose.

930
01:44:12.032 --> 01:44:15.134
But suppose you find nothing,
but wasteland?

931
01:44:15.467 --> 01:44:18.866
How will you survive?
He won't survive.

932
01:44:23.584 --> 01:44:24.738
Nova.

933
01:44:28.602 --> 01:44:31.878
How 'bout coming along?
We can't.

934
01:44:31.974 --> 01:44:34.369
It's better than going
to jail for heresy.

935
01:44:34.402 --> 01:44:36.410
Oh, they can't
convict us of heresy.

936
01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:38.184
You've helped prove
our innocence.

937
01:44:38.490 --> 01:44:43.003
Besides,
his culture is our culture.

938
01:44:43.979 --> 01:44:46.644
Well, good luck then.

939
01:44:52.683 --> 01:44:53.823
Lucius.

940
01:44:55.064 --> 01:44:57.384
I still say you're making
a mistake.

941
01:44:57.579 --> 01:45:00.748
That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.
What?

942
01:45:00.911 --> 01:45:02.767
The flags of discontent.

943
01:45:02.793 --> 01:45:05.162
Remember,
never trust anybody over 30.

944
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:08.938
Doctor, I'd like
to kiss you good-bye.

945
01:45:16.733 --> 01:45:20.797
All right, but...
you're so damned ugly.

946
01:45:46.527 --> 01:45:49.845
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.

947
01:45:49.884 --> 01:45:51.589
Of that I'm sure.

948
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:54.857
All my life
I've awaited your coming...

949
01:45:54.892 --> 01:45:57.709
and dreaded it,
like death itself.

950
01:45:57.735 --> 01:46:02.366
Why? I've terrified you
from the first, Doctor. I still do.

951
01:46:02.708 --> 01:46:05.518
You're afraid of me
and you hate me. Why?

952
01:46:05.609 --> 01:46:07.245
Because you're a man.

953
01:46:08.245 --> 01:46:12.655
And you're right,
I have always known about man.

954
01:46:13.596 --> 01:46:16.951
From the evidence,
I believe his wisdom...

955
01:46:16.977 --> 01:46:19.635
must walk hand in hand
with his idiocy.

956
01:46:20.055 --> 01:46:22.526
His emotions must
rule his brain.

957
01:46:22.552 --> 01:46:25.631
He must be a warlike
creature who gives battle

958
01:46:25.657 --> 01:46:28.565
to everything around him,
even himself.

959
01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:31.818
What evidence?
There were no weapons in that cave.

960
01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:35.059
The Forbidden Zone
was once a paradise.

961
01:46:35.274 --> 01:46:39.667
Your breed made
a desert of it ages ago.

962
01:46:39.693 --> 01:46:41.625
It still doesn't
give me the "why".

963
01:46:41.953 --> 01:46:44.967
A planet where apes
evolved from men?

964
01:46:46.182 --> 01:46:50.143
There's gotta be an answer.
Don't look for it, Taylor.

965
01:46:51.218 --> 01:46:53.572
You may not like what you find.

966
01:47:02.007 --> 01:47:03.382
Untie me!

967
01:47:17.756 --> 01:47:20.758
No, no, no. Wait! Wait!

968
01:47:21.978 --> 01:47:23.223
Let him go.

969
01:47:25.628 --> 01:47:28.523
Lieutenant, fetch our explosives.

970
01:47:28.549 --> 01:47:32.733
We're going to seal up the cave.
Yes, sir. Seal the cave?

971
01:47:32.759 --> 01:47:36.055
That is correct, and you will
both stand trial for heresy.

972
01:47:36.194 --> 01:47:40.551
But the proof, the doll.
In a few minutes, there will be no doll.

973
01:47:40.769 --> 01:47:43.071
There can't be. I'm sorry.

974
01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:46.559
Dr. Zaius.
Dr. Zaius, you mustn't. You promised.

975
01:47:46.585 --> 01:47:50.461
What I do, I do with no pleasure.
Silence him. Doctor.

976
01:47:51.316 --> 01:47:54.655
Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!

977
01:47:54.933 --> 01:47:57.386
Why must knowledge stand still?

978
01:47:57.481 --> 01:47:59.319
What about the future?

979
01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:02.932
I may just have saved it for you.

980
01:48:06.010 --> 01:48:08.340
What will he find
out there, Doctor?

981
01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.236
His destiny.

982
01:50:22.582 --> 01:50:26.577
Oh, my God! I'm back.

983
01:50:28.542 --> 01:50:32.842
I'm home.
All the time, it was.

984
01:50:35.243 --> 01:50:38.054
We finally, really did it.

985
01:50:38.796 --> 01:50:40.799
You maniacs!

986
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:43.721
You blew it up!

987
01:50:44.255 --> 01:50:46.855
Oh, damn you!
