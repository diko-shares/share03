1
00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:24.273
[Man] And that completes my final
report until we reach touchdown.

2
00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:27.819
We're now on full automatic
in the hands of the computers.

3
00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:31.447
I've tucked my crew in
for the long sleep...

4
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:35.159
and I'll be joining them soon.

5
00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:39.455
In less than an hour, we'll finish
our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.

6
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710
Six months in deep space,
by our time, that is.

7
00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:47.463
According to Dr. Hasslein's
theory of time...

8
00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.216
in a vehicle traveling
nearly the speed of light...

9
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.345
the Earth has aged
nearly 700 years since we left it...

10
00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:57.765
while we've aged hardly at all.

11
00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:04.647
Maybe so.
This much is probably true.

12
00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:09.068
The men who sent us on this journey
are long since dead and gone.

13
00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:13.197
You who are reading me now
are a different breed.

14
00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:16.033
I hope a better one.

15
00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:19.328
I leave the 20th century
with no regrets.

16
00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:23.374
But one more thing,
if anybody's listening, that is.

17
00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.836
Nothing scientific.
It's purely personal.

18
00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:30.548
But seen from out here...

19
00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:35.470
everything seems different,
time bends...

20
00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:38.598
space is... boundless.

21
00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:41.225
It squashes a man's ego.

22
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.521
I feel lonely.

23
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:55.865
That's about it.

24
00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.660
Tell me though-

25
00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:03.372
does man,
that marvel of the universe...

26
00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:07.293
that glorious paradox
who sent me to the stars...

27
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:09.504
still make war
against his brother...

28
00:02:11.507 --> 00:02:14.509
keep his neighbor's
children starving?

29
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.582
[Beeping]

30
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.912
[Rocket Jets Blasting Loudly]

31
00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:57.606
[Rocket Accelerating]

32
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.754
[Crashing Sound]

33
00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.520
You all right?

34
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:26.862
Stewart?

35
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.325
Stewart-

36
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:35.412
[Loud Screeching]

37
00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:55.391
We're in the soup. She's sinking.
Dodge, read the atmosphere.

38
00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:13.117
Landon!
Get out a last signal!

39
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.327
What signal?

40
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:18.539
To Earth that we've landed.

41
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.999
The air's okay.

42
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.920
Blow the hatch before
we lose all our power.

43
00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:15.554
- [Flicking Switches]
- It's no use. The power's gone.

44
00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:18.641
Forget it. Abandon ship.

45
00:11:03.163 --> 00:11:06.081
- [Explosion]
- She's sinking.

46
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.920
Going...

47
00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:15.382
going...

48
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.762
gone.

49
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.560
Okay. We're here to stay.

50
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.787
Well, where are we?
Do you have any notions' Skipper?

51
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.456
We're some 320 light-years
from Earth...

52
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.544
on an unnamed planet in orbit
around a star in the constellation of Orion.

53
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.630
Is that close enough for you?

54
00:11:56.633 --> 00:12:00.719
- [Landon] Could be Bellatrix.
- [Dodge] It's too white for Bellatrix.

55
00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:04.098
You didn't have time
to read the tapes.

56
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.683
So you really
don't know, do you?

57
00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.977
What went wrong?

58
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.647
We weren't programmed
to land in the water.

59
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.901
[Dodge] The question is not so much
where we are, as when we are.

60
00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:19.238
[Taylor] All right, we've had enough
sleep to hold us a while.

61
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:22.032
Let's start earning
all that back pay.

62
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.364
Dodge, run your soil test.

63
00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.619
- Got your sensors?
- Right.

64
00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.872
- Geiger counter?
- Got it.

65
00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.918
[Man]
Let's see, one pistol...

66
00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:20.048
twenty rounds ammo,
a medical kit, camera, TX-9.

67
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:24.344
We've got food and water enough
for three days.

68
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:26.472
How long is a day?

69
00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:30.309
That's a good question. Landon.

70
00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.478
Hey, Landon!

71
00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.563
Join the expedition.

72
00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.943
Sorry. I was thinking about Stewart.

73
00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.154
- What do you suppose happened?
- Air leak.

74
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.699
- She died in her sleep.
- You don't seem very cut up about it.

75
00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:49.369
It's a little late for a wake.
She's been dead nearly a year.

76
00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:52.998
That means we've been away
from Earth for 18 months.

77
00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:55.083
Our time.

78
00:13:56.753 --> 00:13:58.754
You've gone gray.

79
00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:04.843
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper
for a man who's 2,031 years old.

80
00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:08.764
I read the clocks.
They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.

81
00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:12.476
We have been away from Earth
for 2,000 years...

82
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.561
give or take a decade.

83
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:21.026
Still can't accept it, huh?
Time's wiped out everything you ever knew.

84
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.028
It's all dust.

85
00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:25.030
Prove it.

86
00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:28.033
If we can't get back,
it's still just a theory.

87
00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:31.954
It's a fact, Landon.
Buy it. You'll sleep better.

88
00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:37.459
Nothing will grow here.
There's just a trace of carbohydrates.

89
00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:42.130
- All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates.
- No dangerous ionization?

90
00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.132
No.

91
00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:47.553
Well, if there's no life here...

92
00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:50.847
we've got just 72 hours to find it.

93
00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:53.850
That's when the groceries run out.
Let's go.

94
00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.936
Which direction?

95
00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.440
- That way.
- Any particular reason?

96
00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:03.527
None at all.

97
00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.657
Come on-

98
00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:16.164
[Laughing]

99
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:25.340
[Laughing Echoing]

100
00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.762
[Both Panting]

101
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.119
[Thunderclaps]

102
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:39.266
[Loud Rumbling]

103
00:17:56.617 --> 00:17:59.703
- [Panting]
- Everybody all right?

104
00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:03.623
Water check.

105
00:18:11.382 --> 00:18:13.383
Eight ounces.

106
00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.933
It doesn't add up.

107
00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.269
Thunder and lightning and no rain.

108
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:29.065
Cloud cover at night, that strange luminosity,
yet there's no moon.

109
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.109
If we could just get a fix.

110
00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.111
What would that tell you?

111
00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:36.990
- I've told you where you are and when you are.
- All right, all right.

112
00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:41.286
You're 300 light-years
from your precious planet.

113
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:45.457
Your loved ones are dead and forgotten
for 20 centuries.

114
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.959
Twenty centuries!
Even if you could get back...

115
00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:50.670
they would think you were something
that fell out of a tree.

116
00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.714
Ah, Taylor, quit riding him.

117
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.675
There is just one reality left-
we are here and it is now.

118
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.679
You get a hold of that and hang on to it,
or you might as well be dead.

119
00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:01.389
I'm prepared to die.

120
00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:05.185
[Chuckling]
He-He's prepared to die.

121
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:08.647
[Laughing]
Doesn't that make you misty?

122
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.566
Chalk up another victory
for the human spirit.

123
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.660
Clue me in on something,
will you?

124
00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:26.414
Why did you sign on for this trip?
You volunteered. Why?

125
00:19:26.499 --> 00:19:28.917
Never mind.
I'll clue you in.

126
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.003
You were the golden boy
of the class of '72.

127
00:19:32.088 --> 00:19:35.090
When they nominated you for the big one,
you couldn't turn it down...

128
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:38.176
not without losing
your All-American image.

129
00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:40.178
Climb off, will you?

130
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:43.223
Oh, and the glory.
Don't forget that.

131
00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:48.186
There's a life-size bronze statue of you
standing out there somewhere.

132
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.898
Oh, it's probably turned green by now,
nobody can read the nameplate.

133
00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:54.192
But never let it be said
that we forget our heroes.

134
00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.278
Taylor, I'm telling you
to climb off my back.

135
00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:59.447
Hmm. And there's one last item-
immortality.

136
00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.867
You wanted to live forever,
didn't you?

137
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.286
Well, you damn near made it.

138
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.040
Except for me and Dodge, you've lived longer
than anyone ever born.

139
00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:13.211
And with our lovely
Lieutenant Stewart dead...

140
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.881
looks like you're
the last of the line.

141
00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:20.552
You got what you wanted, Tiger.
How does it taste?

142
00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:24.055
Okay, you read me well enough.

143
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.850
- But why can't I read you?
- Don't bother.

144
00:20:28.311 --> 00:20:31.938
Dodge, there, he's not like me at all,
but he makes sense.

145
00:20:33.858 --> 00:20:35.942
He'd walk naked into a live volcano...

146
00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:39.696
if he thought he could learn something
that no other man knew.

147
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.701
But you-you're no seeker.
You're negative.

148
00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.912
And I'm not prepared to die.

149
00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:50.999
I'd like to know why not.
You thought life on Earth was meaningless.

150
00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.084
You despised people.

151
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.337
So what'd you do?
You ran out.

152
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:58.048
No. No, it's not like that' Landon.

153
00:20:58.132 --> 00:21:00.842
I'm a seeker too.

154
00:21:00.927 --> 00:21:03.219
But my dreams aren't like yours.

155
00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.430
I can't help thinking
somewhere in the universe...

156
00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:08.433
there has to be something
better than man.

157
00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.644
Has to be.

158
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.189
Taylor, over here!

159
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:55.438
Life.

160
00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:11.746
Where there's one, there's another...

161
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.499
and another and another.

162
00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.584
Let's find 'em.

163
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:53.366
Skipper!

164
00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:56.494
Look.

165
00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:15.972
- Scarecrows?
- Let's see.

166
00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:59.641
[Water Rushing]

167
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:04.938
To hell with the scarecrows.

168
00:26:46.772 --> 00:26:48.690
Yee-hoo!

169
00:26:48.774 --> 00:26:51.276
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

170
00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.369
[Sighs]

171
00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:04.872
[Yells]
Whoo!

172
00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:09.210
Yea! Yea!

173
00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:20.596
Ah!

174
00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:29.480
Taylor.

175
00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:31.566
Look at this.

176
00:27:56.467 --> 00:27:58.384
Taylor, look!

177
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.992
They didn't leave much,
did they?

178
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.358
Well, at least
they haven't tried to bite us.

179
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.361
Blessed are the vegetarians.

180
00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:32.455
[Taylor] They look more or less human,
but I think they're mute.

181
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:44.759
We got off at the wrong stop.

182
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:49.555
You're supposed to be
the optimist, Landon.

183
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.724
Look on the bright side.

184
00:30:51.808 --> 00:30:53.726
If this is the best
they've got around here...

185
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.479
in six months
we'll be running this planet.

186
00:31:04.238 --> 00:31:08.407
[Howling]

187
00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:40.314
[Animal Grunting]

188
00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:42.418

195
00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:02.034
- Smile.
- [Laughing]

196
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.371
[Laughs]

197
00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:42.783
Which one was wearing
the strange clothes?

198
00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:45.828
This one.

199
00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:52.167
- Will he live?
- I don't know.

200
00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:54.837
This beast has lost a lot of blood.

201
00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:58.799
[Sniffs]

202
00:37:01.303 --> 00:37:05.139
- There's no probe here. Find one.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:37:06.182 --> 00:37:08.100
This place is dirty, Doctor.

204
00:37:08.184 --> 00:37:11.979
Doctor' these animals are dirty.

205
00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:15.107
They stink and they carry
communicable diseases.

206
00:37:15.191 --> 00:37:17.234
Why aren't they cleaned up
before they're brought here?

207
00:37:17.319 --> 00:37:19.737
[Female Ape]
You don't sound happy in your work.

208
00:37:19.821 --> 00:37:22.364
[Male Ape]
I'm little more than a vet in this laboratory.

209
00:37:22.449 --> 00:37:25.618
You promised to speak
to Dr. Zaius about me.

210
00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:29.580
I did. You know how he looks down
his nose at chimpanzees.

211
00:37:29.664 --> 00:37:32.041
But the quota system
has been abolished.

212
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:35.294
- You made it. Why can't I?
- What do you mean "made it"?

213
00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:39.590
I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.
We have no authority.

214
00:37:39.674 --> 00:37:42.551
You do all right when it comes
to getting space and equipment.

215
00:37:42.636 --> 00:37:47.181
That's because Dr. Zaius
realizes our work has value.

216
00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:51.268
The foundations of scientific brain surgery
are being laid right here...

217
00:37:51.353 --> 00:37:54.188
in studies of cerebral functions
of these animals.

218
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:58.108
They're still dirty, Doctor.

219
00:37:58.193 --> 00:38:01.028
And their bite is septic.
There, look at that.

220
00:38:03.448 --> 00:38:05.574
Hold his jaw.

221
00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:33.769
- Good morning, Dr. Zira.
- Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?

222
00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:37.648
No change. The minute you open the door,
he goes into his act.

223
00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:40.484
[Rattling Cage]

224
00:38:40.568 --> 00:38:44.488
Well. And what do
we want this morning?

225
00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:47.074
Do we want something?
Come on, speak.

226
00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:49.994
Come on, speak.

227
00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:53.080
Do we want some sugar,
old-timer? Hmm?

228
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:57.543
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.

229
00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:59.920
Oh, don't be silly.
He's perfectly tame.

230
00:39:00.005 --> 00:39:02.881
Ah, they're all tame
until they take a chunk out of you.

231
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:06.427
Well, Bright Eyes,
is our throat feeling better?

232
00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:09.596
[Zira]
Still hurts, doesn't it?

233
00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:12.683
See, he keeps pretending he can talk.

234
00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:14.768
[No Sound]

235
00:39:16.104 --> 00:39:19.106
That Bright Eyes is remarkable.

236
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.859
He keeps trying to form words.

237
00:39:21.943 --> 00:39:24.319
You know what they say-
"Human see, human do."

238
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:32.244
Now what?

239
00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:36.123
He seems to want something.

240
00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:39.626
[Julius]
I'd be careful, Doctor.

241
00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:43.630
What'd I tell you!
Try that again and I'll break your arm!

242
00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:48.469
[Julius]
Good morning, Your Excellency.

243
00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:50.679
[Zira]
Dr. Zaius.

244
00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:55.225
[Julius]
Good morning, sir.

245
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:59.480
- Open up, please.
- I'm so glad you could come.

246
00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:01.899
Sir, he's over here.

247
00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:08.238
Bright Eyes... show him.

248
00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:11.283
Go ahead, do your trick.

249
00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:14.661
Speak. Go on, speak again.

250
00:40:17.207 --> 00:40:20.918
There! Can you believe it?

251
00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:24.671
Yes, amusing.
A man acting like an ape.

252
00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:31.261
Dr. Zaius, I could swear
he's answering you.

253
00:40:31.346 --> 00:40:34.264
He has a definite gift for mimicry.

254
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:36.517
It's most unusual.

255
00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:40.437
He's using that
old blanket as clothing.

256
00:40:40.522 --> 00:40:44.775
I wonder how he'd score
on a Hopkins manual dexterity test?

257
00:40:44.859 --> 00:40:48.028
- An animal?
- Look!

258
00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:52.866
- He's moving his fingers.
- Only because he saw you moving yours.

259
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:55.661
Oh, but perhaps he understood.

260
00:40:55.745 --> 00:40:59.456
Man has no understanding.

261
00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:03.418
He can be taught a few very simple tricks,
nothing more.

262
00:41:03.503 --> 00:41:07.214
I'm afraid I must disagree.
According to my experiments-

263
00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:11.301
Dr. Zira, I must caution you.

264
00:41:11.386 --> 00:41:17.099
Experimental brain surgery on these creatures
is one thing, and I'm all in favor of it.

265
00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:21.395
But your behavioral studies
are something else again.

266
00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:26.567
To suggest that we can learn anything
about the simian nature...

267
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:30.154
from a study of man
is sheer nonsense.

268
00:41:30.238 --> 00:41:32.489
Besides, man is a nuisance.

269
00:41:32.574 --> 00:41:36.034
He eats up his food supplies
in the forest...

270
00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:40.581
then migrates to our green belts
and ravages our crops.

271
00:41:43.418 --> 00:41:46.420
The sooner he is exterminated,
the better.

272
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:50.757
It's a question of simian survival.

273
00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:04.688
[Ape]
Is this the one you wanted, Doctor?

274
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:08.442
[Zira]
Ah, yes. Thank you.

275
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:12.237

I've got a present for you.

277
00:42:23.208 --> 00:42:25.500
[Zira]

282
00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:20.472
Cornelius, up here.

283
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:25.269
- Do you have to work tonight?
- No.

284
00:43:25.353 --> 00:43:27.354
Neither do I.
[Chuckles]

285
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:33.902
- Oh, Cornelius.
- [Chuckles]

286
00:43:49.711 --> 00:43:52.587
- There's- There's Bright Eyes.
- Hmm?

287
00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:54.589
The one I was telling you about.

288
00:43:54.674 --> 00:43:57.551
What's so special about him?

289
00:43:57.635 --> 00:44:00.470
Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes.

290
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:02.973
How's our throat today?

291
00:44:05.727 --> 00:44:07.644
[Cornelius Giggling]

292
00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:11.648
- Look, she remembers!
- Remembers what?

293
00:44:11.733 --> 00:44:14.318
- The blood transfusion.
- Zira, really.

294
00:44:14.402 --> 00:44:18.488
You know they can't- Hey. Hey, watch out.
Here comes Number One.

295
00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:22.534
Something's bothering him. He's been prying
around the lab for the last two days.

296
00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:25.954
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Uh, good morning, Dr. Zaius.

297
00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:30.125
- You, uh, know my, uh- Dr. Cornelius, my fiancé.
- Of course.

298
00:44:30.209 --> 00:44:35.255
The young ape with a shovel. I hear you're
planning another archaeological expedition.

299
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.341
With the Academy's approval, sir.

300
00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:41.720
- The project will require my support, of course.
- I hope I may count on it, sir.

301
00:44:41.804 --> 00:44:44.556
Cornelius, a friendly warning.

302
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.478
As you dig for artifacts,
be sure you don't bury your reputation.

303
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.285
- Stop!
- [Whistle Blowing]

304
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:08.288
Stop!

00:45:29.435 --> 00:45:31.937
[Zira]
Stop! You've hurt him!

307
00:45:33.398 --> 00:45:35.649
- Take him inside.
- [Whip Cracks]

308
00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:41.822
Cornelius? Cornelius,
if you have a moment today...

309
00:45:41.906 --> 00:45:45.784
I'd like to discuss
this expedition of yours in more detail.

310
00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:49.830
Oh, certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes
and I'll come right over.

311
00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:52.582
I don't understand
these animal psychologists.

312
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:55.419
What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?

313
00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:58.588
That man can be domesticated.

314
00:45:58.673 --> 00:46:02.217
[Laughing]

315
00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:40.130
- What happened?
- Oh, those fools and their torches!

316
00:46:40.214 --> 00:46:42.507
- Do you have any ointment?
- I'll see.

317
00:46:48.181 --> 00:46:50.223
I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.

318
00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:58.023
Julius!

319
00:47:00.318 --> 00:47:02.235
I told you what you'd get!

320
00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.322
Julius, don't, don't, don't.
It doesn't matter.

321
00:47:05.406 --> 00:47:07.616
[Zira]
Julius, don't hurt him!

322
00:47:10.453 --> 00:47:12.704
Julius!

323
00:47:17.919 --> 00:47:20.170
Natural-born thieves, aren't they?

324
00:47:32.892 --> 00:47:35.977
Get me a collar and leash.

325
00:47:36.062 --> 00:47:39.648
- I'm taking him out of here.
- He's vicious, Doctor.

326
00:47:39.732 --> 00:47:43.109
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- Do as I say!

327
00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:58.291
You- You wouldn't
hurt me, would you...

328
00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:02.879
Taylor?

329
00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:20.689
[Chuckles]
It's a stunt.

330
00:48:20.773 --> 00:48:23.108
Ah, humans can't write.

331
00:48:23.192 --> 00:48:27.654
Dear, you're a scientist.
Don't you believe your own eyes?

332
00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:34.119
Where did you learn
to do this?

333
00:48:37.707 --> 00:48:42.836
"Jefferson Public School."

334
00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:52.387
"Fort Wayne, Indiana."

335
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:57.934
Back on that planet
you say you came from?

336
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:00.937
Uh-huh.

337
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:04.608
[Chuckles]
Yes, yes.

338
00:49:04.692 --> 00:49:09.279
Maybe he is intelligent,
but he's also' uh, crazy.

339
00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:13.283
Cornelius. Cornelius, please.

340
00:49:18.247 --> 00:49:21.166
"Dodge was killed in the hunt.

341
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.210
What happened to Landon?"

342
00:49:26.339 --> 00:49:28.882
I don't know.

343
00:49:28.966 --> 00:49:31.384
They fell out of the sky with you?

344
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.058
"Not fell, flew."

345
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.685
Flight is a scientific impossibility.

346
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:43.855
And even if it weren't, why fly?

347
00:49:43.939 --> 00:49:45.940
Where would it get you?

348
00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:05.043
"Do you have maps?"

349
00:50:18.474 --> 00:50:22.602
Uh- [Clears Throat]
We're here. You were captured here.

350
00:50:25.564 --> 00:50:28.692
You fell into the water here?

351
00:50:28.776 --> 00:50:33.238
You came ashore,
marched across the desert...

352
00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:36.116
mountains...

353
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.243
- many days and nights-
- [Sighs]

354
00:50:38.327 --> 00:50:40.954
and reached the jungle.

355
00:50:41.038 --> 00:50:43.581
Out of the question.

356
00:50:45.418 --> 00:50:48.878
Cornelius, why do you insist
on provoking him?

357
00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:53.383
No creature can survive in the Forbidden Zone.
I know. I've been there. I've seen it.

358
00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:59.889
"Then how do you account for me?"

359
00:50:59.974 --> 00:51:04.185
I don't.
And I'm not going to try.

360
00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:08.940
But what about your theory?

361
00:51:10.234 --> 00:51:13.403
The existence of someone
like Taylor might prove it.

362
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:15.739
Zira, do you want
to get my head chopped off?

363
00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:19.743
Don't be foolish.
If it's true, they'll have to accept it.

364
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:22.579
[Chuckles]
Oh, no, they won't.

365
00:51:22.663 --> 00:51:27.876
Oh. Cornelius has developed
the most brilliant hypothesis-
- But I'm probably wrong.

366
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:33.673
that the ape evolved from
a lower order of primate, possibly man.

367
00:51:34.675 --> 00:51:36.801
In his trip to the Forbidden Zone...

368
00:51:36.886 --> 00:51:41.431
he discovered traces of a culture
older than recorded time.

369
00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:44.893
- The evidence was very meager.
- You didn't think so then.

370
00:51:44.977 --> 00:51:48.813
That was before Dr. Zaius and half
of the Academy said that my idea was heresy.

371
00:51:48.898 --> 00:51:52.317
How can scientific truth be heresy?

372
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:57.489
What if Taylor is exactly
the proof you needed? A mutation?

373
00:51:57.573 --> 00:52:03.328
A missing link between
the unevolved primate and the ape?

374
00:52:03.412 --> 00:52:05.455
[Bangs Table]

375
00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:07.874
Touchy, isn't he?

376
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:11.544
Hmm. "I am not a missing link."

377
00:52:11.629 --> 00:52:15.965
Well, if he were a missing link, the Sacred Scrolls
wouldn't be worth their parchment.

378
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.718
Well, maybe they're not.

379
00:52:18.803 --> 00:52:21.137
[Chuckles]
Oh, no, thank you.

380
00:52:21.222 --> 00:52:23.139
I'm not going to get into that battle.

381
00:52:23.224 --> 00:52:26.226
- Cornelius, show some strength.
- Zira, listen to me!

382
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:29.646
Now we both have fine futures-

383
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.148
marriage, stimulating careers.

384
00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:34.943
- I'm up for a raise.
- [Door Opens]

385
00:52:35.027 --> 00:52:36.778
[Cornelius]
Dr. Zaius.

386
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.324
Did you forget
our appointment, Cornelius?

387
00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:43.827
Oh, no, sir.
I was, uh, just collecting my notes.

388
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:48.081
You know Dr. Maximus, of course,
our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?

389
00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:50.416
Yes, sir. It's a pleasure
to see you again.

390
00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:55.713
- What is that?
- A man, Dr. Maximus.

391
00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:59.342
I know it's a man.
And you know the rules-

392
00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:01.678
No animals allowed
outside the compound...

393
00:53:01.762 --> 00:53:03.847
and, most especially,
not without a leash.

394
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:09.310
Uh, yes, sir. But-But this, uh, creature
is a- is a special case.

395
00:53:09.395 --> 00:53:11.312
Why special?

396
00:53:11.397 --> 00:53:14.274
Um, we're conducting
a new experiment.

397
00:53:14.358 --> 00:53:18.069
Wouldn't that more properly
be done in your office?

398
00:53:18.153 --> 00:53:22.615
- Yes, sir.
- Guards, return this beast to the compound.

399
00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.202
What is this?

400
00:53:28.455 --> 00:53:32.542
A toy. It floats on the air.

401
00:53:32.626 --> 00:53:35.628
- Zira.
- Try it.

402
00:53:35.713 --> 00:53:37.714
Nonsense.

[Door Opening]

404
00:53:55.733 --> 00:53:58.943
What’s up, Lieutenant?
- We're taking Number Four over
to surgery in five minutes.

405
00:53:59.028 --> 00:54:00.987
- Have him ready.
- How come?

406
00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:03.072
The beast's throat is nearly healed.

407
00:54:03.157 --> 00:54:05.325
It's not his throat this time.
The vet's gonna geld him.

408
00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:08.995
[Julius] Dr. Zira won't like it.
She wants that pair to mate.

409
00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:11.414
These orders come
from Dr. Zaius himself.

410
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:13.499
There's nothing
she can do about it.

He lives again.

419
00:55:17.815 --> 00:55:20.942
Yes, he has found peace in heaven.

420
00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.488
He was a model for us all.

00:55:25.572 --> 00:55:28.449

Yes.

He was a font of simian kindness.

429
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:55.351
"I never met an ape I didn't like."

All these rags he's wearing
give off a stench...

498
01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:27.715
that's offensive to the dignity

for this inquiry.

You asked for the opportunity
to present your case.

Surely you must know
why you're here.

504
01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:58.621
At the very least, this man has the right
to know whether there's a charge against him.

Objection!
This exhibit is indeed a man.

506
01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:06.462
Therefore, he has no rights
under Ape Law.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:09.757
Well, Dr. Zira, this is a man,
is it not?

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:15.262
He is unlike any man you have ever seen,
as we hope to prove.

509
01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:18.682
Answer the question, Dr. Zira.
Is it a man?

510
01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:22.728
Uh, sir, perhaps the question
is the point at issue.

511
01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:27.524
Is he a man? Is he a deviate
or a freak of nature?

512
01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:30.110
- Objection.
- Sustained.

513
01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:34.156
Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness,
you must admit...

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.911
that the accused is a nonape
and therefore has no rights under Ape Law.

515
01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:40.913
Then why is he called
"the accused"?

516
01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:45.376
Your Honors must think him guilty
of something.

517
01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:50.964
Creature's not being tried,
he's being disposed of.

518
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:55.302
It is scientific heresy
that is being tried here.

519
01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:59.431
Well put, Dr. Zaius.
Let us warn our friends...

520
01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:03.644
that they endanger their own careers
by defending this animal.

521
01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:07.106
[Taylor]
Then I'll defend myself.

522
01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:15.823
Dr. Zira, would you tell...
Bright Eyes to be quiet?

523
01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:20.494
- My name is Taylor-
- Bailiff! Silence the animal.

524
01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:22.955
Wait, let me-
[Grunts]

525
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.543
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

526
01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:31.088
Learned judges, my case is simple.

527
01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.924
It is based on
our First Article of Faith.

528
01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:37.302
That the Almighty created the ape
in his own image.

529
01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:39.388
That he gave him
a soul and a mind.

530
01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:42.224
That he set him apart
from the beasts of the jungle...

531
01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.935
and made him
the lord of the planet.

532
01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:48.856
These sacred truths
are self-evident.

533
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.984
The proper study of apes is apes.

534
01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:57.406
But certain young cynics
have chosen to study man.

535
01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:03.287
Yes. Perverted scientists who advance
an insidious theory called evolution.

536
01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:06.039
Come to the point, Dr. Honorious.

537
01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:11.170
The state charges that Dr. Zira
and a corrupt surgeon named Galen...

538
01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.338
experimented on this wounded animal...

539
01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:16.592
tampering with his brain
and throat tissues...

540
01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:19.928
- to produce a speaking monster.
- That's a lie!

541
01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:25.184
- Mind your tongue, madam.
- Did we create his mind, as well?

542
01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:30.355
Not only can this man speak,
he can think. He can reason.

543
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.818
[Scoffs]
That can reason?

544
01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:39.698
With the tribunal's permission, allow me to expose
this hoax by direct examination.

545
01:08:39.783 --> 01:08:43.202
Proceed, Doctor, but
do not turn this hearing into a farce.

546
01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:55.130
Tell the court, Bright Eyes,
what is the Second Article of Faith?

547
01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.426
I know nothing of your culture.
I-I admit that.

548
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:03.388
Of course he doesn't know our culture
because he cannot think.

549
01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:09.061
Tell us, why are all apes
created equal?

550
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:13.357
- Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
- Ridiculous.

551
01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:17.986
Tell us, Bright Eyes,
why do men have no souls?

552
01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:22.199
What is the proof that a divine spark
exists in the simian brain?

553
01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:25.786
Huh?
[Scoffs]

554
01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.585
Read this for me.

555
01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:47.933
Since the defendant has been forbidden
to speak in his own defense...

556
01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:53.397
he requests that the, uh, following statement
be read into the record.

557
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:55.941
You, Dr. Cornelius.
Read it.

558
01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:02.030
Yeah. [Clears Throat]
"I have come to you...

559
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:04.992
"from a planet
in a different solar system.

560
01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:06.994
"I am an explorer in space"-

561
01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:09.580
Stop right there.
Let me see that paper.

562
01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:21.133
[Chuckling]
It's a joke... in very poor taste.

563
01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:25.387
Is it a joke to seek the truth
about this man?

564
01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:28.724
Dr. Zira, you state here that a ship
from outer space...

565
01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:31.351
sank in an inland sea
of our eastern desert.

566
01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:35.105
You also state that Bright Eyes
had two intelligent companions...

567
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:39.192
- with him at the time of his capture.
- That is his assertion.

568
01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:43.488
Mr. President,
in addition to Bright Eyes...

569
01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:46.742
I believe the prosecutor
has reassembled...

570
01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:50.370
all the surviving humans
that were captured in the hunt.

571
01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:54.291
- That's true, Dr. Zaius.
- Very well.

572
01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:58.462
Then I suggest that we go
take a look at them.

573
01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.168
[Taylor]
That's him! That's Landon.

574
01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:41.588
- Which one?
- The tall one in the back.

575
01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:46.468
Do you acknowledge kinship
with any of these creatures?

576
01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:50.722
- With one them' yes.
- Identify him then. Speak to him.

577
01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:56.603
Landon? Landon?

578
01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:05.237
Oh, they cut him.

579
01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:08.949
Did you know about this?

580
01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:12.703
No. I swear.
I never saw this man before.

581
01:12:12.787 --> 01:12:16.498
But they-

582
01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:22.004
You did it.
You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon!

583
01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.256
Stop him!

584
01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.894
Take him inside!

585
01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:21.813
Mr. President,
a word of explanation.

586
01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:24.566
The human specimen
you saw outside...

587
01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:27.986
suffered a skull fracture
in the course of the hunt.

588
01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:33.116
Two fine veterinary surgeons
under my direction were able to save his life.

589
01:13:33.201 --> 01:13:37.913
But the beast could not speak,
of course. Nor will he ever speak.

590
01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:41.249
You did that to him, damn you!
You cut out his memory!

591
01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:43.919
You took his identity, and that's what
you want to do to me!

592
01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.797
Bailiff, gag the animal!

593
01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:51.343
Damn you!
[Muffled Yelling]

594
01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:54.096
May it please the tribunal,
I for one grant you...

595
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.389
that this creature cannot have come
from another planet.

596
01:13:56.474 --> 01:14:00.727
But this much is certain. He does come
from somewhere in the Forbidden Zone.

597
01:14:00.812 --> 01:14:05.357
He's described the region to us and described
it accurately, for... I have been there.

598
01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:08.944
- You've visited the Forbidden Zone?
- Yes, sir.

599
01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:11.863
A-A year ago- with the special permission
of the Academy.

600
01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:16.284
He exceeded his orders.
His travel permit was canceled immediately.

601
01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:22.082
Yes, sir' that is true. Thanks to you.
But not before I discovered evidence...

602
01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:25.627
of a simian culture that existed long
before the Sacred Scrolls were written.

603
01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:29.506
Objection! These remarks
are profane and irrelevant.

604
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:33.260
Sustained. Your archaeological theories
have no bearing...

605
01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:35.345
on the disposition
of this creature.

606
01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:38.390
Let them talk, Mr. President.
Let them talk.

607
01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:43.728
Sirs, our theories have
a bearing on his identity.

608
01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:48.859
- [President] How so?
- Let us assume, as common sense dictates...

609
01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:51.903
that the prisoner's story
is false.

610
01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:55.323
But if he did not come
from another planet...

611
01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:58.243
then surely
he sprang from our own.

612
01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:01.830
Yes, sprang!

613
01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:06.001
As an animal psychologist,
I have found no physiological defect...

614
01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:08.378
to explain why humans are mute.

615
01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:10.630
- Objection!
- Sustained!

616
01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.757
[Zira]
Their speech organs are adequate.

617
01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:15.802
The flaw lies not in anatomy,
but in the brain.

618
01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:17.804
- [Honorious] Objection!
- Sustained!

619
01:15:17.889 --> 01:15:21.474
Sustain all objections,
but face the truth.

620
01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:26.229
Yes. Behold this marvel,
this living paradox.

621
01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:28.857
This missing link
in an evolutionary chain.

622
01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:32.194
Silence! You go too far!

623
01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:34.613
[Zaius]
I think an indictment is in order.

624
01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:39.826
Yes, sir. The state charges Dr. Zira
and Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal...

625
01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:42.996
malicious mischief
and scientific heresy.

626
01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.123
It's so ordered.

627
01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:47.459
This tribunal will examine
all the evidence presented here...

628
01:15:47.543 --> 01:15:51.171
and in due course, render its verdict
as to the proposed indictment...

629
01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:55.926
and as to the disposition
of the deviate in question.

630
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:58.803
This hearing is adjourned.

631
01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:48.395
[Zaius]
Wait outside.

632
01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:02.242
Well, the verdict is in.

633
01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:05.036
At the moment,
your two simian friends...

634
01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:08.290
and sponsors
are free on bail.

635
01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:11.918
But they'll soon
be brought to trial for heresy.

636
01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:17.173
- What about me?
- [Chuckles] Your case was preordained.

637
01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:20.093
In a way, you did
the state a service...

638
01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:24.597
because you made it possible
for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.

639
01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:28.768
Now the tribunal
has placed you in my custody...

640
01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:30.937
for final disposition.

641
01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:36.651
- You realize what that means?
- No.

642
01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:39.612
Emasculation, to begin with.

643
01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:44.367
Then experimental surgery
on the speech centers- on the brain.

644
01:17:44.452 --> 01:17:47.579
Eventually, a kind of living death.

645
01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:53.251
However...

646
01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:57.339
I have it in my power
to grant a reprieve.

647
01:17:57.423 --> 01:18:00.008
That is why I summoned you
here tonight.

648
01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:05.847
Tell me who and what you really are
and where you came from...

649
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.974
and no veterinary
shall touch you.

650
01:18:08.059 --> 01:18:10.852
I told you that
at that hearing of yours.

651
01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:13.063
You lied!

652
01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:17.359
- Where is your tribe?
- My tribe. [Scoffs]

653
01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:20.278
They live on another planet
in another solar system.

654
01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:24.407
Even in your lies,
some truth slips through.

655
01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:28.787
That mythical community you're supposed
to come from, Fort Wayne.

656
01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:31.873
- What about it?
- A fort!

657
01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:35.377
Unconsciously, you chose
a name that was belligerent.

658
01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:38.088
Where were you nurtured?

659
01:18:38.172 --> 01:18:42.217
Then you don't believe
that prosecutor's charge...

660
01:18:42.301 --> 01:18:47.138
- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira?
- Certainly not.

661
01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:52.644
Uh, you're a mutant.

662
01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.897
That's what Zira and Cornelius claim.
You're talking heresy, Doctor.

663
01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:59.776
- Hmph. Of course.
- Well, suppose I am a mutant?

664
01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:03.571
How can the appearance
of one mutant send you into a panic?

665
01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:07.409
Because you're not unique.
There's the one you call Landon.

666
01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:10.745
- Oh, then you admit that-
- I admit that where there's one mutant...

667
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:14.916
there's probably another and another
and another- a whole nest of them.

668
01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.962
Where is your nest, Taylor?

669
01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:22.173
- Where are your women?
- Thank you.

670
01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:26.719
Thank you for calling me
Taylor, Dr. Zaius.

671
01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:30.974
I know who I am.
But who are you...

672
01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:35.186
and how in hell did this upside-down
civilization get started?

673
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:38.606
[Grunts]
You may well call it upside-down...

674
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:42.819
since you occupy its lowest level-
and deservedly so.

675
01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:49.284
Our eastern desert
has never been explored...

676
01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:53.788
because we've always assumed that life
cannot exist there.

677
01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:57.083
Taylor, save yourself.

678
01:19:57.168 --> 01:20:01.963
Tell me, is there another jungle
beyond the Forbidden Zone?

679
01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.382
[Sighs]
I don't know.

680
01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:09.304
If you're trying to protect others
of your kind, it'll cost you your identity.

681
01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:14.184
I'm not protecting anyone.
This whole thing is insane. What have I done?

682
01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:24.819
You are a menace.
A walking pestilence.

683
01:20:24.904 --> 01:20:27.864
I do know
who you are, Taylor.

684
01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:33.953
I'll give you just six hours
to make a full confession.

685
01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:38.041
After that, I shall use surgery
to obtain one. Guards!

686
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.377
All right' you can cut pieces out of me.
You've got the power.

687
01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:43.755
Return this creature
to his cage.

688
01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.882
But you do it out of fear.
Remember that!

689
01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:50.553
Remember that! Because you're afraid
of me! What are you afraid of, Doctor?

690
01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.772
[Rattling Door]

691
01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.870
- Are you Julius?
- Who are you?

692
01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:18.998
I'm from the office
of Animal Affairs.

693
01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:24.504
That male is to be
transferred to the zoo.

694
01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.632
At this hour?
Who says so?

695
01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.385
Don't they tell you anything?

696
01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:34.180
The Antivivisectionist
Society is up in arms.

697
01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:37.517
They're gonna save this beast
from those butchers in the lab.

698
01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.563
If he can speak,
he belongs in the public zoo.

699
01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:45.525
But what'll probably happen is that some
money-mad grown-up will put him in a circus.

700
01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.695
- Then we'll have to pay to see what rightfully-
- Stop making speeches...

701
01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:50.780
and show me the order.

702
01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:54.701
[Paper Rustling]

703
01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:02.917
[No Audible Dialogue]

704
01:22:05.713 --> 01:22:09.173
Ha, this order's no good.

705
01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:12.635
It must be countersigned
by Dr. Zaius.

706
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.846
Grab him!

707
01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:24.814
- Who are you?
- So you can talk. I'm Dr. Zira's nephew.

708
01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:28.651
This abduction was her idea.
You're not really going to the zoo.

709
01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:30.945
That's just our story
in case somebody stops us.

710
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:33.031
Get me out of this.

711
01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:37.535
We've gotta move fast.

712
01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:43.416
- She comes along too.
- Zira doesn't want your female.

713
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.587
- I want her.
- If you insist.

714
01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:50.131
- But I'm not taking any orders.
- All right. Come on.

715
01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:52.216
Let's go.

716
01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:17.992
- I told you not to bring the other one!
- He wouldn't leave her.

717
01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:21.037
Oh, all right.
Come on!

718
01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:31.130
- Here, put this on. Come on.
- Don't you have any clothes for me?

719
01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:34.676
What do you expect,
an ape's new suit?

720
01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.221
- This stuff stinks.
- Well, so do you, like all men.

721
01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:42.517
Taylor, remember,
all men look alike to most apes.

722
01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:47.438
So put it on and keep quiet,
and we may just get away with this. Hurry!

723
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:40.032
Cornelius!

724
01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:51.002
- How'd it go?
- Hey!

725
01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:55.757
Come on.
Let me out of this.

726
01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:07.643
Well, Taylor,
we're all fugitives now.

727
01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:10.271
Do you have any weapons,
any guns?

728
01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.858
- The best. But we won't need them.
- I'm glad to hear it.

729
01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.943
I want one anyway.

730
01:25:24.203 --> 01:25:26.329
Now look here, Taylor'
I'm in charge of this expedition.

731
01:25:26.413 --> 01:25:29.290
- Good for you. But you're not in charge of me.
- [Cocks Gun]

732
01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:33.044
Not anymore.
I don't plan to be caught again.

733
01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:36.422
As you wish.

734
01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:40.301
Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was
another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone.

735
01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:42.470
I'll try for that.
What about you?

736
01:25:42.554 --> 01:25:46.140
Cornelius and I
have been indicted for heresy.

737
01:25:46.225 --> 01:25:49.811
Unless we can prove our theories,
we don't stand a chance of acquittal.

738
01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.854
You're going back
to the Forbidden Zone?

739
01:25:51.939 --> 01:25:55.149
We're going back to the diggings
I worked at over a year ago.

740
01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:57.985
It's a three-day ride
across the desert...

741
01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:01.113
and near the place where you claim
you landed from that planet of yours.

742
01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:03.115
Still don't believe me, do you?

743
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.827
It's a long detour to Dead Lake.
What would we find?

744
01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:10.164
Nothing much. An empty rubber life raft.
Maybe a little flag...

745
01:26:10.249 --> 01:26:12.917
the emblem of my countrymen.

746
01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:16.337
The terrain around
that lake is poisonous.

747
01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:19.257
There's no fresh water,
no vegetation, nothing.

748
01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:27.598
Anyway, I ought to thank you
for saving me. You'll be in trouble for that.

749
01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:34.105
We've been in trouble
since the moment we met you.

750
01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:39.777
- What's she pointing at?
- This must be close to home for her.

751
01:26:39.862 --> 01:26:41.863
She knows it.

752
01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:49.453
Nova, no. Nova. Nova!
You can't go there.

753
01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:52.248
It's not safe. Nova.

754
01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:56.711
We better get started.

755
01:26:56.795 --> 01:26:59.714
If the mounted police pick up our trail,
they'll come this far at least.

756
01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:03.092
Right. Let's get the water
and provisions into the wagon.

757
01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:19.502
[Taylor]
Cornelius.

758
01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.422
Where does this river lead to?

759
01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:25.925
It flows into a sea
some miles from here.

760
01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:29.804
- That's where we'll find the diggings.
- And beyond that?

761
01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:33.891
I don't know. You can't ride along
the shore at high tide...

762
01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:37.353
and we had no boats
on our last expedition.

763
01:28:37.437 --> 01:28:41.774
You never told me, why do you call
this a Forbidden Zone?

764
01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:45.027
No one knows.
It's an ancient taboo...

765
01:28:45.112 --> 01:28:47.363
set forth in the Sacred Scrolls.

766
01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:50.408
The Lawgiver pronounced
this whole area deadly.

767
01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:57.415
- Shouldn't we be moving on?
- I'm for that.

768
01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:28.339
There, do you like it?

769
01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.888
Why did you do that,
scrape off your hair?

770
01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:40.768
In my world- when I left it-
only kids your age wore beards.

771
01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:45.147
Beards?
I don't go in for fads.

772
01:30:45.232 --> 01:30:49.902
Somehow... it makes you
look less intelligent.

773
01:30:50.987 --> 01:30:53.489
When will you show me
what's in that cave?

774
01:30:53.573 --> 01:30:56.242
Right now, if you like.

775
01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:16.554
Cornelius!

776
01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:30.860
- Lucius, don't fire at them.
- You're all under arrest.

777
01:31:35.115 --> 01:31:39.076
If there's any more shooting,
Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go.

778
01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:42.288
- You can count on it!
- Taylor, you are not in command here.

779
01:31:42.372 --> 01:31:44.540
- Put down that gun.
- Shut up!

780
01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:47.918
Very well.
Lower your weapons.

781
01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:51.630
Tell them to pull back
around the rocks. Out of range.

782
01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:54.466
Withdraw!

783
01:32:00.307 --> 01:32:02.850
- How did you know we'd come here?
- It wasn't difficult.

784
01:32:02.934 --> 01:32:06.353
Only an apostate
would flee to the Forbidden Zone.

785
01:32:06.438 --> 01:32:10.566
And only a fool
would give a gun to an animal.

786
01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:13.527
I see you've brought
the female of your species.

787
01:32:13.612 --> 01:32:17.573
I didn't realize
that man could be monogamous.

788
01:32:17.657 --> 01:32:20.201
On this planet, it's easy.

789
01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:25.456
I'll ask you to reconsider
the rash course you've undertaken.

790
01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:29.960
If you’re convicted of heresy,
the most you'll get is two years.

791
01:32:30.045 --> 01:32:35.257
But, if you persist in pointing guns
in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.

792
01:32:35.342 --> 01:32:38.594
We never meant
to be treasonous, sir.

793
01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:42.223
But up there in the face of that cliff,
there is a vast cave...

794
01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:46.560
and in that cave a fabulous treasure
of fossils and artifacts.

795
01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:50.147
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts.
They're worth-

796
01:32:50.232 --> 01:32:52.233
There's your Minister of Science...

797
01:32:52.317 --> 01:32:55.527
honor-bound to expand
the frontiers of knowledge.

798
01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:58.781
- Taylor, please!
- Except that he's also chief defender of the Faith.

799
01:32:58.865 --> 01:33:03.911
There is no contradiction
between faith and science. True science.

800
01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:07.206
- Are you willing to put that statement to the test?
- Taylor, I would much rather-

801
01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:11.460
Take it easy. You saved me from
this fanatic. Maybe I can return the favor.

802
01:33:11.544 --> 01:33:14.922
What is your proposal?

803
01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:17.925
When were those Sacred Scrolls
of yours written?

804
01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:21.095
- Twelve hundred years ago.
- All right.

805
01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:24.765
Now, if they can prove those scrolls
don't tell the whole truth of your history...

806
01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:27.851
if they can find some real evidence
of another culture...

807
01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:30.854
from some remote past,
will you let them off?

808
01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:34.692
- Of course.
- Let's go up to the cave.

809
01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:42.616
Sorry, Lucius, you've got to stay here
and guard the camp.

810
01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:45.911
Always giving orders,
just like every other adult.

811
01:33:45.996 --> 01:33:49.373
Relax, you'll get
to see it all later on.

812
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.062
Present your evidence, Cornelius.

813
01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:58.650
It was at this level that I discovered
traces of an early ape creature-

814
01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:04.490
a stage of primitive barbarism,
really, dating back some 1,300 years, roughly.

815
01:35:04.574 --> 01:35:10.204
It was at this level I discovered
cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz...

816
01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:14.375
and the fossilized bones
of carnivorous gorillas.

817
01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:18.962
But the artifacts lying here...

818
01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:23.008
were found at this level...

819
01:35:23.093 --> 01:35:26.970
and date back,
uh, 700 years earlier.

820
01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:32.393
That's the paradox. For the more
ancient culture is the more advanced.

821
01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:36.063
Now, admittedly,
many of these objects are unidentified.

822
01:35:36.147 --> 01:35:40.317
But clearly, they were fashioned
by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.

823
01:35:40.402 --> 01:35:45.072
Indeed, the fact that
many of these tools are unknown to us...

824
01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:49.743
suggests a culture which,
in certain ways, equals our own.

825
01:35:49.828 --> 01:35:51.954
Some of the evidence
is uncontestable.

826
01:35:52.038 --> 01:35:55.833
Don't speak to me in absolutes.
The evidence is contestable.

827
01:35:57.377 --> 01:35:59.670
- I apologize, sir.
- To begin with...

828
01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:03.465
your methods of dating
the past are crude, to say the least.

829
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:07.094
There are geologists on my staff
who'd laugh at your speculations.

830
01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:10.722
- But there's the doll, sir.
- What?

831
01:36:11.975 --> 01:36:14.810
Oh, uh, lying right there.
The human doll.

832
01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:24.987
What does this prove?
My granddaughter plays with human dolls.

833
01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:29.741
The doll was found
beside the jawbone of a man...

834
01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:33.370
and no trace of simian fossil
has been found in this deposit.

835
01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:35.622
Your conclusion is premature.

836
01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:39.543
Have you forgotten your scripture?
The 13th Scroll?

837
01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:42.379
"And Proteus brought
the upright beast into the garden...

838
01:36:42.464 --> 01:36:46.133
and chained him to a tree,
and the children did make sport of him."

839
01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:48.135
No, sir,
I have not forgotten.

840
01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:53.140
Well, for a time, the ancients
kept humans as household pets...

841
01:36:53.224 --> 01:36:56.935
until our Lawgiver
proved that man could not be tamed.

842
01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.646
Keep digging' Cornelius.

843
01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:05.694
You'll find evidence
of the master of this house- an ape.

844
01:37:09.073 --> 01:37:14.203
- What are you doing?
- Reconstructing a past life.

845
01:37:16.289 --> 01:37:19.791
You say these things were
found at the same level as that doll?

846
01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:22.503
Whoever owned him
must have been in pretty bad shape.

847
01:37:22.587 --> 01:37:28.425
He wore false teeth
and eyeglasses.

848
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:30.928
He had a failing heart.

849
01:37:31.012 --> 01:37:36.475
Towards the end he had
this prefabricated valve put in it.

850
01:37:38.603 --> 01:37:41.647
I don't say he was a man
like I knew at home...

851
01:37:41.731 --> 01:37:45.984
but he must have been a close relative
because he had all the same weaknesses.

852
01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:50.864
He was a weak, fragile animal.

853
01:37:50.949 --> 01:37:54.743
But he was here before you,
and he was better than you are.

854
01:37:54.827 --> 01:37:59.039
That's lunacy.
I can offer alternate descriptions...

855
01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:04.002
of every one of those articles
which is just as ingenious as yours.

856
01:38:04.087 --> 01:38:06.672
But it'd be conjecture.
Not proof.

857
01:38:06.756 --> 01:38:08.632
[Doll]
Mommy.

858
01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:17.683
[Doll]
Mommy.

859
01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:25.816
Dr. Zaius, would an ape
make a human doll that talks?

860
01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:31.613
- [Gunshot]
- Lucius!

861
01:38:31.698 --> 01:38:34.199
[Gunshot]

862
01:38:34.284 --> 01:38:37.703
You dirty- Nova!

863
01:38:39.706 --> 01:38:42.457
[Gunshots Continue]

864
01:38:58.182 --> 01:39:01.018
- Nova!
- [Gunshot]

865
01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:35.844
[Gunshots]

866
01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:40.807
[Weakly]
Cornelius. Zira.

867
01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:43.268
Help me.

868
01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:47.105
[Doll]
Mommy.

869
01:39:52.779 --> 01:39:57.240
I ought to kill you right now.
Come on.

870
01:39:58.743 --> 01:40:01.036
You tell him to pull back now!

871
01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:04.081
Cease fire! Withdraw!

872
01:40:05.917 --> 01:40:09.044
- Up there.
- Withdraw!

873
01:40:11.214 --> 01:40:13.215
Get down.

874
01:40:26.979 --> 01:40:29.022
Lucius, are you all right?

875
01:40:29.107 --> 01:40:31.650
They took me by surprise.

876
01:40:31.734 --> 01:40:35.195
Sneaked up on me
while I was feeding the horses.

877
01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:38.699
What's happened to honor?

878
01:40:38.783 --> 01:40:41.201
I got off two rounds
to warn you.

879
01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:44.246
- They've taken everything.
- Not quite everything.

880
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:48.041
They left a hostage behind.

881
01:40:48.126 --> 01:40:50.210
- How are you feeling?
- Disillusioned.

882
01:40:50.294 --> 01:40:55.173
- You can't trust the older generation.
- I know what you mean.

883
01:40:55.258 --> 01:40:57.634
I want you to go around the rocks
and tell those gorillas...

884
01:40:57.719 --> 01:41:01.722
- I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner.
- Yes, I can do that.

885
01:41:01.806 --> 01:41:03.849
I want a horse, food and water.

886
01:41:03.933 --> 01:41:08.729
Enough for a week for me and
this female... and 50 rounds of ammunition.

887
01:41:08.813 --> 01:41:12.441
- What if they won't agree to your terms?
- Tell them I'll shoot him.

888
01:41:12.525 --> 01:41:16.653
- Taylor, you can't.
- Ah, yes, he can.

889
01:41:17.697 --> 01:41:19.614
He's a born killer.

890
01:41:19.699 --> 01:41:22.159
Deliver the message.

891
01:41:23.536 --> 01:41:26.037
Over here.

892
01:41:28.958 --> 01:41:31.168
Sit down.

893
01:41:48.186 --> 01:41:51.438
Taylor, please.
Don't treat him like that.

894
01:41:51.522 --> 01:41:55.442
- Why not?
- It's humiliating.

895
01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:59.112
The way I was humiliated...
by all of you?

896
01:41:59.197 --> 01:42:01.114
You led me around on a leash.

897
01:42:01.199 --> 01:42:04.117
That was different.
We thought you were inferior.

898
01:42:04.202 --> 01:42:06.536
Now you know better.

899
01:42:06.621 --> 01:42:09.831
Cornelius was right, Doctor.
He proved it.

900
01:42:09.916 --> 01:42:13.210
Man was here first. You owe him
your science, your culture...

901
01:42:13.294 --> 01:42:15.462
whatever civilization you've got.

902
01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:20.967
Then answer me this.
If man was superior, why didn't he survive?

903
01:42:21.052 --> 01:42:25.555
Wiped out by a plague.
Some natural catastrophe, a storm of meteors.

904
01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:28.809
From the looks of some parts of this planet,
I'd say that was a fair bet.

905
01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:32.604
- But we can't be sure.
- He is.

906
01:42:32.688 --> 01:42:37.317
He knew all the time.
Long before you found your caves, he knew.

907
01:42:37.401 --> 01:42:40.695
Defender of the Faith.
Guardian of the Terrible Secret-

908
01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:45.283
- That's it, isn't it, Doctor?
- What I know of man was written long ago...

909
01:42:45.368 --> 01:42:49.162
set down by the greatest ape
of all, our Lawgiver.

910
01:42:49.247 --> 01:42:52.457
Cornelius, come here.

911
01:42:52.542 --> 01:42:54.459
Reach into my pocket.

912
01:42:54.544 --> 01:42:59.089
Read to him
the 29th Scroll, sixth verse.

913
01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:07.013
"Beware the beast man,
for he is the devil's pawn.

914
01:43:07.098 --> 01:43:11.977
"Alone among God's primates,
he kills for sport...

915
01:43:12.061 --> 01:43:15.230
"or lust or greed.

916
01:43:15.314 --> 01:43:19.150
"Yea, he will murder his brother
to possess his brother's land.

917
01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:22.237
"Let him not breed
in great numbers...

918
01:43:22.321 --> 01:43:26.616
"for he will make a desert
of his home and yours.

919
01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:31.621
"Shun him.
Drive him back into his jungle lair...

920
01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:34.791
for he is the harbinger of death."

921
01:43:36.794 --> 01:43:40.213
I found nothing in the cave
to alter that conception of man...

922
01:43:40.298 --> 01:43:42.340
and I still live by its injunction.

923
01:43:51.309 --> 01:43:53.268
[Taylor]
That's far enough.

924
01:44:00.693 --> 01:44:04.112
They think
you're behaving foolishly.

925
01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:08.116
I must say I agree.
Where will you go?

926
01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.411
To start with,
I'll follow the shoreline and my nose.

927
01:44:11.495 --> 01:44:16.958
But suppose you find nothing but wasteland?
How will you survive?

928
01:44:17.043 --> 01:44:19.711
He won't survive.

929
01:44:23.925 --> 01:44:25.926
Nova.

930
01:44:28.554 --> 01:44:30.639
How 'bout coming along?

931
01:44:30.723 --> 01:44:34.559
- We can't.
- It's better than going to jail for heresy.

932
01:44:34.644 --> 01:44:38.605
Oh, they can't convict us of heresy.
You've helped prove our innocence.

933
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:43.610
Besides,
his culture is our culture.

934
01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:47.072
Well, good luck then.

935
01:44:52.787 --> 01:44:55.497
Lucius.

936
01:44:55.581 --> 01:44:57.749
I still say you're making a mistake.

937
01:44:57.833 --> 01:45:01.002
- That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.
- What?

938
01:45:01.087 --> 01:45:05.632
The flags of discontent.
Remember, never trust anybody over 30.

939
01:45:05.716 --> 01:45:09.344
Doctor, I'd like
to kiss you good-bye.

940
01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:21.189
All right, but...
you're so damned ugly.

941
01:45:46.632 --> 01:45:49.759
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.

942
01:45:49.844 --> 01:45:52.012
Of that I'm sure.

943
01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:54.806
All my life
I've awaited your coming...

944
01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:57.475
and dreaded it,
like death itself.

945
01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:02.856
Why? I've terrified you
from the first, Doctor. I still do.

946
01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.525
You're afraid of me
and you hate me. Why?

947
01:46:05.609 --> 01:46:08.153
Because you're a man.

948
01:46:08.237 --> 01:46:13.700
And you're right,
I have always known about man.

949
01:46:13.784 --> 01:46:16.870
From the evidence,
I believe his wisdom...

950
01:46:16.954 --> 01:46:20.081
must walk hand in hand
with his idiocy.

951
01:46:20.166 --> 01:46:22.625
His emotions must
rule his brain.

952
01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:28.339
He must be a warlike creature who gives battle
to everything around him- even himself.

953
01:46:28.424 --> 01:46:31.760
What evidence?
There were no weapons in that cave.

954
01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:35.388
The Forbidden Zone
was once a paradise.

955
01:46:35.473 --> 01:46:39.517
Your breed made
a desert of it ages ago.

956
01:46:39.602 --> 01:46:42.020
It still doesn't
give me the "why."

957
01:46:42.104 --> 01:46:46.232
A planet where apes
evolved from men?

958
01:46:46.317 --> 01:46:50.278
- There's gotta be an answer.
- Don't look for it, Taylor.

959
01:46:50.362 --> 01:46:53.531
You may not like what you find.

960
01:47:02.166 --> 01:47:04.167
Untie me!

961
01:47:17.932 --> 01:47:20.850
No, no, no. Wait! Wait!

962
01:47:22.186 --> 01:47:24.395
Let him go.

963
01:47:25.731 --> 01:47:28.608
Lieutenant, fetch our explosives.

964
01:47:28.692 --> 01:47:31.820
- We're going to seal up the cave.
- Yes, sir.

965
01:47:31.904 --> 01:47:36.282
- Seal the cave?
- That is correct, and you will
both stand trial for heresy.

966
01:47:36.367 --> 01:47:40.829
- But the proof, the doll.
- In a few minutes, there will be no doll.

967
01:47:40.913 --> 01:47:44.207
There can't be. I'm sorry.

968
01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:46.501
Dr. Zaius.
Dr. Zaius, you mustn't. You promised.

969
01:47:46.585 --> 01:47:49.420
What I do, I do with no pleasure.
Silence him.

970
01:47:49.505 --> 01:47:51.422
Doctor.

971
01:47:51.507 --> 01:47:54.968
Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!

972
01:47:55.052 --> 01:47:59.597
Why must knowledge stand still?
What about the future?

973
01:48:00.724 --> 01:48:03.893
I may just have saved it for you.

974
01:48:06.147 --> 01:48:09.774
What will he find
out there, Doctor?

975
01:48:09.859 --> 01:48:11.943
His destiny.

976
01:50:22.741 --> 01:50:27.036
Oh, my God! I'm back.

977
01:50:28.789 --> 01:50:33.251
I'm home.
All the time, it was-

978
01:50:35.379 --> 01:50:38.506
We finally, really did it.

979
01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:42.176
You maniacs!

980
01:50:42.261 --> 01:50:47.724
You blew it up!
Oh, damn you!
