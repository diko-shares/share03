00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.320
Look at these cuspids. (GROWLS)

-(GROANS) Why am I talking to moose?

-No, we're squirrels, eh.
-Wolverine.

347
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.440
I'll find it myself.

348
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.840
-Oh, I wouldn't go that way.
-Why not, eh?

349
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.920
Uh, well, there was a reason.

350
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.360
TUKE: You brought it up.
RUTT: I'm trying to...

-Well, no, but it's driving me nuts.

Ow. (GROANS)

357
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.120
Hey. Is the coast clear?

358
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.960
-What?
-Are there any hunters around?

359
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.480
-Uh... No.
-Oh, good!

360
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.280
-(SHOUTS)
-You didn't see the trap?

361
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.360
I saw it from a mile away.
You must be pretty embarrassed.

362
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.720
Don't worry.

363
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.200
(WHISPERS) I won't tell anyone.

364
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.720
-What?
-You need to get down. Let me help.

365
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.400
Oh, wait. Ow!

366
00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.080
-Hold still.
-Just... Stop that. Ow!

367
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.240
If you just...

368
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.240
-Stop it!
-It's no use.

369
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.960
The only way to get down
is to chew your own foot off.

370
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.960
I don't need some stupid bear's help.
I just need the stick.

371
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.320
-Okay, here.
-No, I'll do it myself.

372
00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.000
Put it back. No, where you found it.

373
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.960
-Oh.
-To the left. By the little rock.

374
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.440
-Here?
-Yes.

375
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.920
Okay.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.640
Boy, that tree is strong, huh?

377
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.760
You know, when I was little,
I was really into climbing trees.

378
00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.120
All kinds of trees.

379
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.960
I climbed pine trees, oaks, cedars,
maples, birch trees, willow trees...

380
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.160
My eyes were watering
and my tongue was swollen.

381
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.920
From that moment on,
I was more careful about what I lick.

-That was funny. Do it again.

385
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.360
-Don't you have someplace to go?
-Yeah, the salmon run.

386
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.520
How about this?
I get you down, then we go together.

387
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.560
-Deal?
-Yeah, okay, fine.

388
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.080
If you can magically get me down,
I'll go with you to this...

389
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.200
-Salmon run.
-Whatever. But if you can't...

390
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.560
You turn around, walk away,
and never come back, ever.

-Yeah.

-Pinky swear?
-Yeah, sure, fine, pinky swear.

393
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.400
But this is a human trap
and you're just a dumb little bear.

There's no way
you're going to be able...

we travel by day and sleep by night.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.240
-How's it going, bear boy?
-And, uh, smallish bear.

519
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.680
I didn't know you had a little brother.
He's cute.

520
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.680
-Actually, he's...
-There was this hunter following us.

521
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.960
We was thinking if we could
maybe just hang out with you guys.

522
00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.640
-Just hang out.
-Yeah, it'd be fun.

523
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.960
-If the hunter was going to catch up...
-Then you'd eat him.

524
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.640
-That's what we was thinking.
-We lost the hunter at the glacier.

525
00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.600
You don't think he'll follow those?

526
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.400
-They are quite nice.
-I've got an idea.

527
00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.800

It's not as easy as it looks.
Just watch what I do.

531
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.200

RUTT: Beauty, eh?

544
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:26.160
Okay, here's how I remember it.
The snow is white, it's all right.

545
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.680
Yellow or green, it's just not clean.

546
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.440
I learned that one the hard way.

547
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.040
That reminds me. Last year at the
salmon run my friend Bucky dared me.

548
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.240
But I'd heard of a cub
who stuck his tongue to an iceberg.

549
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.200
Then he started to float away.

550
00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.040
To save him
they had to rip off his tongue,

551
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.080
so now he hath to talk like thith
all the time and...

552
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.000
-Do you ever stop talking?
-Oh!

553
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.560
Look. The night rainbow.

554
00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.760
-You can see the spirits from here.
-You know about the great spirits?

555
00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.080
Yeah, my grandma's up there,
and my granddad.

556
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.840
Mom says the spirits make
all the magical changes in the world.

557
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.760
Like how the leaves change color,
or the moon changes shapes,

558
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.480
-or tadpoles change into frogs.
-Yeah, I get it.

559
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:16.080
You know, for a change, maybe
they could just leave things alone.

560
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.200
-What do you mean?
-My brother's a spirit.

561
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.160
If it wasn't for him, I...

562
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.120
I wouldn't be here.

563
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.400
You have a brother up there?

564
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.840
-What happened to him?
-He was killed by a...

565
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.320
By a monster.

566
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.880
What's your brother's name?

Sitka.

Thanks, Sitka. If it weren't for you,
I would have never met Kenai.

-All right. I'll go first.
-Okay.

572
00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.400
I spy something green.

-Tree?
-Oh!

574
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.200
-My turn?
-Yeah.

575
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.280
Okay, I spy something tall.

576
00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.280
-Tree.
-Okay.

577
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:42.440
I spy something with bark.

-RUTT: Tree?
-(TUKE GROANS)

579
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.560
Okay, I spy something, uh...

580
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.960
-A vertical log.
-Tree.

581
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.400
-Okay, I spy something...
-Tree.

582
00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.240
-My turn.
-Tree.

583
00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.520
-No, I...
-It counts.

584
00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.960
-I didn't even spy anything.
-It counts.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.280
Okay. Tree.

586
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.760

Koda. Come on.

-Koda, wake up.
-Two more months, Mom.

589
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.960
So, where are we?

590
00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.800
Well, which way?

591
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.440
-I think it's that way.
-You think, or you know?

592
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.560
That way?

593
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.080
Why wasn't I turned
into a homing pigeon?

594
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.760
-Come on.
-Hey, riding mammoths was your idea.

595
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.240
Thanks for the ride, guys. See you.

596
00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.840
Lucky for you,
I've been lost worse than this.

597
00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:54.080
-Last summer, I was with Bucky...
-Enough with the stories.

598
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.560
I don't care about the time
you and Binky found

599
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.120
the world's biggest pine cone ever.

600
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.080
First of all, his name's Bucky, not Binky.

601
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.640
Second, it wasn't a pine cone,
it was a pine nut.

602
00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.800
And it was huge.
Even bigger than your fat head.

603
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.480
Oh, gee,
our big guardian bear is leaving, eh?

604
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.920
Yeah. We'd better follow him. Come on.

605
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.120
-Can you swing your leg...
-I can't get off.

606
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.960
Me, neither. Okay, you guys...

607
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.040
I guess we'll just catch up
with those guys later, eh?

608

-(SIGHS) Good trip, eh?
-Beauty.

609
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.880
You know, I was thinking now
might be a good time for me to drive.

610
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.520
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

611
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.280
Yeah. Okay.

612
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.640
Whee.

613
00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.200
I'm sorry we're lost, okay?

614
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.120
-Even though it's your fault.
-My fault?

615
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.640
(GROANS) That's it.

616
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.400
Just remember, if it weren't for me,
you'd be hanging upside down.

617
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.800
Better than being stuck nowhere
with you and your blabbering mouth.

618
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.440
"I'm lost. I can't find my mommy.
Will you take me to the salmon run?"

619
00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.520
-Why don't you just grow up?
-Fine. I'll go on my own then.

620
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.800
-Fine. Go ahead.
-Fine.

621
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.200

Whoa.

626
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:33.000
Those monsters are really scary.

627

Especially with those sticks.

628
00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.560
Come on, let's go.

629
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.120
So, you recognize anything yet?

630
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.960
Or maybe you can't see past
my fat head.

(BOTH LAUGH)

632
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.840
So, do you really think
I have a fat head?

633
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:12.280
Well, if you hunched your shoulders
a little it wouldn't seem so big.

634
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.800
Oh, you mean like this?

635
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.720
-(LAUGHING)
-Or like this?

636
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.800
How about this?

637
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.960
Oh, my, that was good.

638
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.120
KODA: Maybe they can
give us directions.

639
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.200
-(BOTH GRUNT)
-Oh!

640
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.120
-That clears up the sinuses.
-Oh, it does.

641
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.440
Okay, okay, hit me again.
I think she's looking.

642
00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.800
-Hello, sweetie.
-Yes, she's checking me out, all right.

643

-Hey, baby.
-No, come on, you nitwit.

644
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.680
Are you out of your head?
She's looking at me.

645
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.720
Like she's looking at your ugly mug?
Come on.

646
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.160
Excuse me, miss. It's go-time, baby.

647
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.240
You want to go? Bring it on.

-Hold on.

-Excuse me.
-What do you want? (ECHOING)

-What is that?
-Just a minute, bear.

Hey, shut up. (ECHOES)

No, you shut up.

Hey, will you shut up?

655
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.360
-Just shut up.
-(ECHOING CONTINUES)

656
00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.800
Their horns are screwed on too tight.

657
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.160
Oh, wait a second.

658
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.800
-I know this place.
-You do?

659
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.240
Yeah. The salmon run's not far.

660
00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.600
We just have to go through here.

661
00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.200
What?

662
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.160
Hey, you sure you know
where you're going?

663

-Yah!
-(SHOUTS, GRUNTS)

669

-Don't do that.
-Scared you, didn't I?

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.120
There's scared,
and then there's surprised.

671
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.200
And you were both.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.440
Whoa!

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.840

Uh, you got a little spit right there.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.600
Me and Mom were eating fish,
having a great time.

849
01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.680
All of a sudden she pushes me into
the bushes and tells me to be real quiet.

850
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.560
She says, "I smell something."
So I started sniffing.

851
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.280
There's something in the woods
running towards us,

852
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.880
getting closer and closer.

854
01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.640
And then, out of the trees,
jumps a hunter.

(ALL GASP)

856
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.400
And now there's nowhere for Mom to go.

857
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.200
The monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier.

858
01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.320
The monster attacks,
but Mom's too quick for him.

859
01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.920
And before he can do it again, she
stands up real big and yells, "Go away."

-(SHOUTING)
-SITKA: <i>Kenai.</i>

861
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.720
Mom smells more of them.

862
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.840
There's a whole pack
coming right at us.

863
01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.320
Sitka, no. The bear. Behind you.

864
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.720
<i>She runs to stop them</i>
<i>before they get to me.</i>

865
01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.880
<i>They're all around her,</i>
<i>poking her with sticks.</i>

866
01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.760
-KENAI: Sitka.
<i>-The whole thing broke and fell off.</i>

867
01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.680
<i>There was ice everywhere.</i>

868
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.480
<i>She couldn't hold her breath</i>
<i>any longer, and pow.</i>

869
01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.520
She bursts out of the water.
I've never been so scared in my life.

870
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.720
-KENAI: <i>I'm going after the bear.</i>
-Koda?

871
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.680
DENAHI: <i>Sitka wouldn't want it.</i>
KENAI: <i>Sitka's not here</i>

872
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.800
<i>because of that monster.</i>

873
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.520
Whoa. Fell off a glacier?
I've never seen anything like that.

-Can you imagine?
-(WHIMPERING)

875
01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.040
Kenai. What's the matter, Kenai?

876

FEMALE: What happened next?
FEMALE 2: Was she okay?

877
01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.240
Hey, Kenai, what's wrong?
Where you going?

878
01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.520
She got out of the water okay.
That's how we got separated.

879
01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.520
Right after that I met Kenai.

880
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:33.800
Kenai?

882
01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.240

883
01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.200
-Yeah.
-Where have you been?

884
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.880
-You look horrible.
-Koda...

885
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.960
My mom says when
you eat too much fish, just lie down.

886
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.360
There's something I, uh...

887
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.520
You know that story
you told me last night?

888
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.880
-Yeah.
-Well, I have a story to tell you.

889
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.280
Really? What's it about?

890
01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.480
Well, it's kind of about a man,

891
01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.160
and kind of about a bear.

892
01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.280
But mostly it's about a monster.

893
01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.560
A monster who did something so bad...

894
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.040

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:06.000

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.680
<i>I'd do anything within my power</i>

897
01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.880
<i>I'd give everything I've got</i>

898
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.560
<i>But the path I seek</i>
<i>is hidden from me now</i>

899
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.840

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.080
Listen to me. I was a man
that was changed into a bear.

1020
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.600
No beaver. Man into bear. That's it.

1021
01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.720
Oh. Yeah, so, before that
you was probably like a goat?

1022
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.040
-What about a water buffalo?
-No, he's a rabbit.

1023
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.560
Look at his ears and furry feet.
Watch out for the rabbit, eh.

1024
01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:42.880
No way, eh.

1025
01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.760
Okay, now, everyone,
take a big inhale, eh?

1026
01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.320
And then on...

1027
01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.640
On the exhale,
shift into salutation to the sun.

1028
01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.600
(ALL GROANING)

1029
01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.280
-No, you shut up.
-(GRUNTING)

1030
01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.840
-No, you shut up.
-(GRUNTING)

1031
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.400
(SIGHS)

1032
01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.800
(LAUGHS)

1033
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:13.120
-How you doing over there, Koda?
-Oh, pretty good.

1034
01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:19.240
(BOTH LAUGHING, GROWLING)

1035
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.080
(CLEARS THROAT)

1036
01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:31.600
In accordance with all federal
and state wildlife regulations,

1037
01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.360
no fish were harmed
during the making of this film.

1038
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.040
(FISH SHOUTING)

1039
01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.480
-No! He's gonna eat me!
-(ROARS)

1040
01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.480
(NERVOUS LAUGH) Cut. Cut.

1041
01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.280
Somebody, help me.
Help me. Somebody.

1042
01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.160
-(CHOMP)
-Ooh!

1043
01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.920
(BELCHING)
