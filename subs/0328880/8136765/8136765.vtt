00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.335
<i>This is a story from long ago,</i>

2
00:00:48.408 --> 00:00:51.855
<i>when the great mammoths
still roamed our lands.</i>

3
00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:57.373
<i>It's the story
of my two brothers and me.</i>

4
00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.724
<i>When the three of us were young,</i>

5
00:00:59.804 --> 00:01:03.327
<i>we were taught
that the world is full of magic.</i>

6
00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:12.161
<i>The source of this magic
is the ever-changing lights</i>

7
00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:14.321
<i>that dance across the sky.</i>

8
00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:19.643
<i>The shaman woman of our village</i>

9
00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:23.561
<i>told us that these lights
are the spirits of our ancestors,</i>

10
00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:28.001
<i>and that they have the power
to make changes in our world.</i>

11
00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:33.955
<i>Small things become big.</i>

12
00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:38.397
<i>Winter turns to spring.</i>

13
00:01:41.512 --> 00:01:44.959
<i>One thing always changes
into another.</i>

14
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.991
<i>But the greatest change I ever saw</i>

15
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.870
<i>was that of my brother,</i>

16
00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.269
<i>a boy who desperately
wanted to be a man.</i>

17
00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:02.391
- Get down.
- What?

18
00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:04.594
Get down! Get down!

19
00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:12.548
Kenai.

20
00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:34.067
Never try to milk a caribou.

21
00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:41.776
No. No, don't. No. Come on, don't. No.

22
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:44.143
Hey. Will you two knock it off?

23
00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:47.694
That's all right.
After today, he won't treat me like that.

24
00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.737
Oh, right, the big manhood ceremony.

25
00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:54.460
Doesn't matter what the spirits say,
you'll always be our baby brother.

26
00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:57.293
- Well, wait till I get my totem.
- Baby brother.

27
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.938
Hey, I said knock it off.

28
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.130
The quicker we get these fish,
the faster we get to your ceremony.

29
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.969
Let's all just try and get along
for a few hours. Okay, Denahi?

30
00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:10.208
- Whatever you say.
- Okay, Ken...

31
00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:12.488
So, what are we waiting for?

32
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:21.449
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

33
00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:26.372
<i>When the Earth was young
and the air was sweet</i>

34
00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:31.010
<i>And the mountains kissed the sky</i>

35
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:34.921
<i>In the great beyond</i>

36
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.245
<i>With its many paths</i>

37
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.088
<i>Man and nature lived side by side</i>

38
00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.885
<i>In this wilderness of danger and beauty</i>

39
00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:51.957
<i>Lived three brothers bonded by love</i>

40
00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:56.604
<i>Their hearts full of joy</i>

41
00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:58.998
<i>They ask now for guidance</i>

42
00:03:59.074 --> 00:04:03.241
<i>Reaching out to the skies up above</i>

43
00:04:04.393 --> 00:04:07.351
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

44
00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:10.035
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

45
00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:14.310
<i>Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know</i>

46
00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.033
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

47
00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.117
<i>We are all the same</i>

48
00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:25.228
<i>Brothers to each other
in this world we remain</i>

49
00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:28.194
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

50
00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:32.270
<i>Give us wisdom to pass to each other</i>

51
00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:37.225
<i>And give us strength so we understand</i>

52
00:04:39.223 --> 00:04:41.684
<i>That the things we do</i>

53
00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.145
<i>The choices we make</i>

54
00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:47.909
<i>Give direction to all life's plans</i>

55
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.021
<i>To look and wonder
at all we've been given</i>

56
00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:59.066
<i>In a world that's not always as it seems</i>

57
00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:03.224
<i>Every corner we turn</i>

58
00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:05.740
<i>Only leads to another</i>

59
00:05:05.816 --> 00:05:10.015
<i>A journey ends but another begins</i>

60
00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:14.261
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

61
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:16.897
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

62
00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:21.052
<i>Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know</i>

63
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:24.938
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

64
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.930
<i>We are all the same</i>

65
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.250
<i>Brothers to each other
in this world we remain</i>

66
00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:34.769
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

67
00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:37.247
- Kenai's back.
- Kenai.

68
00:05:37.327 --> 00:05:40.773
Kenai, are you excited
about getting your spirit rock today?

69
00:05:41.086 --> 00:05:43.965
It's not a rock. It'll be my totem.

70
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.132
Ooh!

71
00:05:45.205 --> 00:05:48.325
I'll probably get a sabre-tooth tiger
for bravery,

72
00:05:48.403 --> 00:05:50.288
or strength, or greatness.

73
00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:53.726
- Something that fits me.
- A mammoth for your fat head?

74
00:05:53.802 --> 00:05:56.725
- Make sure you get that basket tied up.
- Don't worry.

75
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.281
No stupid bear
is gonna get near this fish.

76
00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:03.200
Just tie it up.

77
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.683
- She's back. Tanana's back.
- Come on.

78
00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.206
- Come on, Kenai, let's go.
- Come on.

79
00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:12.438
Tanana's got your rock.
Come on.

80
00:06:18.475 --> 00:06:21.518
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

81
00:06:21.594 --> 00:06:23.797
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

82
00:06:23.874 --> 00:06:28.073
<i>Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know</i>

83
00:06:29.192 --> 00:06:31.799
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

84
00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:34.511
<i>We are all the same</i>

85
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:38.955
<i>Brothers to each other
in this world we remain</i>

86
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.510
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

87
00:06:42.588 --> 00:06:47.268
<i>Brothers all the same</i>

88
00:06:48.027 --> 00:06:49.192
Nana.

89
00:06:49.227 --> 00:06:53.710
- Hey, Nana.
- Well, hello there, sweetheart.

90
00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:56.066
What a big girl.

91
00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:03.831
When each of us comes of age,
the great spirits reveal to us a totem

92
00:07:03.903 --> 00:07:06.663
that helps guide us through our lives.

93
00:07:07.462 --> 00:07:10.145
Some of us use courage to guide us.

94
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.060
Others patience.

95
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.907
And some of us beauty.

96
00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:22.142
Kenai.

97
00:07:24.737 --> 00:07:27.181
- You nervous?
- Excited.

98
00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:30.183
You should be.
It's a good one.

99
00:07:30.975 --> 00:07:35.502
Kenai, I have been to the mountain
where the lights touch the earth,

100
00:07:35.574 --> 00:07:40.177
and the great spirits
have revealed to me your totem.

101
00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:46.572
To become a man, your actions
must be guided by one thing.

102
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.177
Your totem is...

103
00:07:54.128 --> 00:07:55.416
Love.

104
00:07:56.448 --> 00:07:59.416
- What?
- Yes, love.

105
00:08:00.487 --> 00:08:02.411
The bear of love?

106
00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:06.810
A love that connects
and unites all living things.

107
00:08:06.885 --> 00:08:09.732
- Who wants to trade?
- There is no trading.

108
00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:12.368
Oh, Kenai,

109
00:08:12.803 --> 00:08:15.290
love is the most precious of totems.

110
00:08:15.363 --> 00:08:18.450
It reveals itself in unexpected ways.

111
00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:23.724
Let love guide your actions,
then one day you'll be a man,

112
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.967
and we'll place your mark
next to those of our ancestors.

113
00:08:45.314 --> 00:08:46.754
Oh.

114
00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:53.396
There he is.

115
00:08:53.472 --> 00:08:55.632
Come here, lover boy.

116
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:58.275
- Leave me alone.
- Kenai, wait.

117
00:08:59.231 --> 00:09:01.475
- I'm sorry.
- What?

118
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.034
Your totem, I think it's really great.

119
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:06.748
- You do?
- Yeah. And I made you something.

120
00:09:06.783 --> 00:09:07.992
Really?

121
00:09:08.027 --> 00:09:10.787
Now when you skip around
loving everybody,

122
00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:13.351
you'll smell so sweet.

123
00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:15.226
Well, isn't this nice?

124
00:09:15.306 --> 00:09:17.590
Instead of fighting,
you're giving each other flowers.

125
00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:21.312
Yeah, isn't it lovely?
He's so in touch with his totem already.

126
00:09:21.784 --> 00:09:24.543
Hey, dog breath,
go take care of the fish.

127
00:09:24.578 --> 00:09:27.548
Sure. Kenai loves me, he loves me not.

128
00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:31.303
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenai loves me, he loves...

129
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:35.069
- Kenai.
- Someday I'm gonna just...

130
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.707
- He's just such a...
- Hey, bonehead.

131
00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:40.822
Just because his totem is wisdom
doesn't mean he's wise.

132
00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:44.063
- I mean, look at him.
- Kenai loves me, he loves me not.

133
00:09:44.377 --> 00:09:46.418
- Hi, Denahi.
- Oh, hi.

134
00:09:46.818 --> 00:09:49.141
Let go!

135
00:09:49.176 --> 00:09:52.055
Yeah, the spirits messed up
on both of our totems.

136
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.455
I felt the same way
when Tanana gave me mine.

137
00:09:54.535 --> 00:09:56.340
- Get out of here.
- No, really.

138
00:09:56.375 --> 00:10:00.334
I said, "The eagle of guidance?
What does that mean?"

139
00:10:00.413 --> 00:10:03.213
But now that I'm older,
I know it's about being a leader

140
00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:04.980
and keeping an eye on you two.

141
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:09.498
I just want to get my handprint
on that wall.

142
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:13.969
Just be patient, Kenai.
When you live by your totem, you will.

143
00:10:14.004 --> 00:10:16.009
- Really?
- Guarantee it.

144
00:10:18.968 --> 00:10:22.328
But come on, the bear of love?

145
00:10:22.407 --> 00:10:24.452
I mean, a bear doesn't love anyone.

146
00:10:24.487 --> 00:10:27.367
They don't think. They don't feel.
I mean, they're...

147
00:10:29.485 --> 00:10:32.452
- They're thieves.
- You didn't tie it up, did you?

148
00:10:32.524 --> 00:10:33.528
Uh...

149
00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:35.243
You should get the totem of pinheads.

150
00:10:35.278 --> 00:10:36.448
Knock it off.

151
00:10:36.483 --> 00:10:38.527
- We'll just make another basket.
- We?

152
00:10:38.562 --> 00:10:42.043
Oh, no. It took me two weeks
to make that basket.

153
00:10:42.602 --> 00:10:45.920
Get lover boy to do it.
He's the one always messing things up.

154
00:10:45.955 --> 00:10:49.084
- Typical Kenai.
- All right, I'll go get your basket.

155
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.000
Kenai, wait. Kenai!

156
00:10:54.638 --> 00:10:56.166
What?

157
00:11:16.672 --> 00:11:19.672
Kenai!

158
00:11:20.631 --> 00:11:22.235
Kenai!

159
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.237
- Where'd he go?
- If we're lucky, far away.

160
00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:30.832
Kenai!

161
00:11:33.987 --> 00:11:36.835
- Kenai.
- Sitka, no, you gotta get out of here.

162
00:11:36.907 --> 00:11:38.706
- What?
- The bear. Behind you.

163
00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:44.145
Hey, bear, come on. Over here.

164
00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:46.423
Come on, bear, come this way.

165
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.744
Denahi!

166
00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:04.866
- Hold on.
- Pull.

167
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:36.371
Sitka. Sitka!

168
00:13:00.403 --> 00:13:01.527
Sitka.

169
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.123
Come on!

170
00:13:18.678 --> 00:13:20.685
- Sitka!
- Sitka!

171
00:13:22.597 --> 00:13:24.601
Sitka. Sitka!

172
00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:27.320
- Sitka?
- Sitka, where are you?

173
00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:29.275
Kenai.

174
00:13:40.112 --> 00:13:41.312
No.

175
00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:44.358
Sitka!

176
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.593
Sitka!

177
00:13:49.549 --> 00:13:51.669
Denahi, let's find him!

178
00:13:51.704 --> 00:13:52.957
Sitka.

179
00:13:54.028 --> 00:13:56.634
Sitka, where are you? Sitka!

180
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.374
- You ready?
- For what?

181
00:14:59.449 --> 00:15:01.369
For going after the bear.

182
00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:06.816
I know what you're feeling,
but killing that bear is wrong.

183
00:15:07.247 --> 00:15:10.574
Wrong? Our brother is dead
and it's because of that monster.

184
00:15:10.966 --> 00:15:13.410
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.

185
00:15:18.005 --> 00:15:21.124
- I see.
- Killing the bear won't make you a man.

186
00:15:21.204 --> 00:15:22.488
Now you're trying to be wise.

187
00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:25.207
I'm trying to follow my totem.
Why can't you?

188
00:15:25.283 --> 00:15:28.282
You really think love
has anything to do with being a man?

189
00:15:28.317 --> 00:15:31.205
A man wouldn't just sit here
and do nothing.

190
00:15:31.721 --> 00:15:35.244
Kenai. Don't upset the spirits.

191
00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:39.043
Spirits.
Thanks for your wisdom.

192
00:16:03.432 --> 00:16:04.992
I've got to stop him.

193
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.393
You left too soon, Sitka.

194
00:16:15.428 --> 00:16:17.915
Your brothers need your guidance.

195
00:17:15.972 --> 00:17:18.219
Ha!

196
00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:50.109
Kenai.

197
00:19:49.449 --> 00:19:50.572
What?

198
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:02.229
Sitka.

199
00:21:58.373 --> 00:21:59.540
No.

200
00:22:52.757 --> 00:22:54.961
<i>I don't blame the bear, Kenai.</i>

201
00:22:58.196 --> 00:23:01.119
<i>A man wouldn't just sit here
and do nothing.</i>

202
00:23:49.901 --> 00:23:54.025
So, Kenai,
you've decided to join the living.

203
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:56.464
Ooh-hoo.
That's quite a bump you've got.

204
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.343
That must have been one heck of a ride
down the rapids.

205
00:23:59.659 --> 00:24:00.782
Tanana?

206
00:24:03.498 --> 00:24:05.985
Ooh.

207
00:24:06.257 --> 00:24:07.941
Nana, you won't believe this.

208
00:24:07.976 --> 00:24:10.343
I was at the top of this rock,
and all of a sudden...

209
00:24:13.855 --> 00:24:15.895
Kenai, honey. Shh-shh-shh.

210
00:24:16.174 --> 00:24:17.941
I don't speak bear.

211
00:24:23.372 --> 00:24:24.572
No.

212
00:24:25.411 --> 00:24:29.099
No, no! No!

213
00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:36.133
All right! All right! All right!
Would you settle down? Settle!

214
00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:39.132
Kenai! Kenai...

215
00:24:39.208 --> 00:24:43.015
Kenai. Kenai. This isn't going to work.

216
00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:49.606
Kenai, listen to me. Sitka did this.

217
00:24:51.444 --> 00:24:55.448
Strange. Spirits don't usually
make these kind of changes.

218
00:24:55.803 --> 00:24:58.287
Oh. Oh, my, my, my, my.

219
00:24:58.322 --> 00:25:01.409
Sitka must have something really big
planned for you. Yep, yep.

220
00:25:01.481 --> 00:25:04.045
You are going to get
a whole new perspective on things.

221
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.404
Oh! Do you see
in black and white or colour?

222
00:25:08.439 --> 00:25:11.883
Hey. Listen to me.
You got yourself into this mess.

223
00:25:11.918 --> 00:25:15.126
If you want to change,
take it up with your brother's spirit.

224
00:25:17.197 --> 00:25:21.277
You'll find him on the mountain
where the lights touch the earth.

225
00:25:21.356 --> 00:25:23.919
He'll help you make up
for what you've done wrong.

226
00:25:23.995 --> 00:25:26.635
But I didn't do anything wrong.

227
00:25:27.274 --> 00:25:29.434
Tanana? Tanana!

228
00:25:29.514 --> 00:25:32.317
Wait. I didn't do anything wrong.

229
00:25:33.392 --> 00:25:35.952
- I don't even know how to get there.
- What happened to them?

230
00:25:35.987 --> 00:25:37.032
I don't know.

231
00:25:37.111 --> 00:25:39.150
They were here.
Now they're gone.

232
00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:41.070
Yeah, that's pretty weird.

233
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:45.197
So you're telling me you didn't eat them
and you have no idea where they are?

234
00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:48.748
- Uh-uh.
- Hey, hey, you. You just talked.

235
00:25:48.783 --> 00:25:51.835
Just back away, real slow-like.

236
00:25:51.907 --> 00:25:55.430
- How did you do that?
- I knew you had them.

237
00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:57.790
Are we there yet?

238
00:25:57.825 --> 00:26:00.465
Don't make me
turn this formation around.

239
00:26:01.664 --> 00:26:05.744
Hey. Wait. Come back.
I'm trying to find where the lights...

240
00:26:05.824 --> 00:26:10.264
- What's he getting worked up about?
- Maybe the goose pooped on him, eh?

241
00:26:12.061 --> 00:26:14.384
Oh, gee. He's looking over here.
Let's beat it. This way.

242
00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:17.429
- No, this way.
- Thank you very much.

243
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.900
- Just stay still and...
- Hey, you two!

244
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.984
Head down.

245
00:26:22.019 --> 00:26:23.904
I think he's seen us. Now what?

246
00:26:23.939 --> 00:26:26.622
- Act like we're not here.
- We're not here.

247
00:26:26.778 --> 00:26:28.897
- Shh! What are you doing?
- You said to...

248
00:26:28.932 --> 00:26:30.581
- Don't say anything. Shh!
- Okay.

249
00:26:30.616 --> 00:26:31.904
- I said, "Don't say anything."
- Um, excuse me.

250
00:26:33.416 --> 00:26:36.296
- Don't eat us.
- You won't like us, eh? We're gamey.

251
00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:38.294
Yeah. Eat hoof-for-brains over there.

252
00:26:38.375 --> 00:26:40.894
- Pine-cone breath.
- Crusty tail.

253
00:26:40.929 --> 00:26:42.301
- Twig legs.
- Big nose.

254
00:26:43.373 --> 00:26:45.652
- Sorry.
- You went too far that time.

255
00:26:45.687 --> 00:26:47.496
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Guys.

256
00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:50.779
- Yours is bigger than mine.
- I'm not eating anybody.

257
00:26:50.891 --> 00:26:52.495
Oh, whew.

258
00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.297
- That's mighty decent of you, eh.
- My name's Rutt.

259
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.498
- This is my brother Tuke.
- How's it going, Bear?

260
00:26:57.889 --> 00:27:01.936
- Don't call me that.
- Sorry, uh...

261
00:27:02.208 --> 00:27:05.851
- Mr. Bear?
- I mean, I'm not a bear. I hate bears.

262
00:27:05.927 --> 00:27:09.810
- Well, gee, you're one big beaver.
- No kidding, eh?

263
00:27:10.166 --> 00:27:12.849
Do either of you know
where the lights touch the earth?

264
00:27:13.165 --> 00:27:15.685
Yee... ahh...

265
00:27:16.044 --> 00:27:19.408
No. Uh, no. Sorry, bear... Er, beaver.

266
00:27:19.443 --> 00:27:22.962
I'm not a beaver, I'm a bear...
No, I mean, I'm not a bear.

267
00:27:22.997 --> 00:27:25.359
- I'm a man.
- Excuse me.

268
00:27:25.394 --> 00:27:27.686
I was transformed into a bear.

269
00:27:27.721 --> 00:27:31.280
Magically. I was lifted into the sky
by my brother.

270
00:27:31.315 --> 00:27:32.687
Uh-huh.

271
00:27:33.159 --> 00:27:34.919
- Crazy.
- Gesundheit.

272
00:27:34.954 --> 00:27:36.926
No. Fruitcake.

273
00:27:36.998 --> 00:27:39.802
- Are you okay?
- No. That bear. Over there.

274
00:27:39.877 --> 00:27:42.005
- He's crazy.
- I am not crazy.

275
00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:45.199
Whoever said you were?
We understand.

276
00:27:45.276 --> 00:27:47.375
- You do?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

277
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.475
You see, we're not moose either.

278
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.915
- We're not?
- No.

279
00:27:51.474 --> 00:27:54.234
We're like, uh...
We're like squirrels. Yeah.

280
00:27:54.314 --> 00:27:56.920
Oh. Oh, yeah. Beauty, eh?

281
00:27:56.992 --> 00:28:01.631
Well, he's actually the squirrel.
I'm more of a purebred wolverine.

282
00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:03.758
Look at these cuspids.

283
00:28:04.191 --> 00:28:08.030
- Give him a little room.
- Why am I talking to moose?

284
00:28:08.065 --> 00:28:10.474
- No, we're squirrels, eh.
- Wolverine.

285
00:28:11.548 --> 00:28:13.468
I'll find it myself.

286
00:28:14.348 --> 00:28:16.748
- Oh, I wouldn't go that way.
- Why not, eh?

287
00:28:17.106 --> 00:28:19.713
Uh, well, there was a reason.

288
00:28:19.786 --> 00:28:22.034
- You brought it up.
- I'm trying to...

289
00:28:24.265 --> 00:28:26.064
Ow!

290
00:28:28.783 --> 00:28:29.984
Ow!

291
00:28:30.063 --> 00:28:33.631
- So, you think of it yet?
- Well, no, but it's driving me nuts.

292
00:28:34.022 --> 00:28:35.822
Ow.

293
00:28:48.658 --> 00:28:50.577
Hey. Is the coast clear?

294
00:28:50.658 --> 00:28:53.297
- What?
- Are there any hunters around?

295
00:28:53.456 --> 00:28:55.704
- Uh... No.
- Oh, good!

296
00:28:55.776 --> 00:28:58.380
You didn't see the trap?

297
00:28:58.415 --> 00:29:02.298
I saw it from a mile away.
You must be pretty embarrassed.

298
00:29:02.374 --> 00:29:03.574
Don't worry.

299
00:29:04.573 --> 00:29:06.896
I won't tell anyone.

300
00:29:07.133 --> 00:29:09.381
- What?
- You need to get down. Let me help.

301
00:29:09.453 --> 00:29:10.980
Oh, wait. Ow!

302
00:29:11.052 --> 00:29:13.539
- Hold still.
- Just... Stop that. Ow!

303
00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:15.618
If you just...

304
00:29:16.011 --> 00:29:18.454
- Stop it!
- It's no use.

305
00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:23.013
The only way to get down
is to chew your own foot off.

306
00:29:23.048 --> 00:29:26.855
I don't need some stupid bear's help.
I just need the stick.

307
00:29:26.927 --> 00:29:29.130
- Okay, here.
- No, I'll do it myself.

308
00:29:29.207 --> 00:29:31.694
Put it back. No, where you found it.

309
00:29:31.846 --> 00:29:34.565
- Oh.
- To the left. By the little rock.

310
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.928
- Here?
- Yes.

311
00:29:36.005 --> 00:29:37.325
Okay.

312
00:29:38.404 --> 00:29:40.929
Boy, that tree is strong, huh?

313
00:29:40.964 --> 00:29:43.931
You know, when I was little,
I was really into climbing trees.

314
00:29:44.003 --> 00:29:45.203
All kinds of trees.

315
00:29:45.282 --> 00:29:50.802
I climbed pine trees, oaks, cedars,
maples, birch trees, willow trees...

316
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.925
My eyes were watering
and my tongue was swollen.

317
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.483
From that moment on,
I was more careful about what I lick.

318
00:30:00.638 --> 00:30:05.885
Ha! See? It's all about using your head.

319
00:30:08.036 --> 00:30:11.559
That was funny. Do it again.

320
00:30:11.635 --> 00:30:15.158
- Don't you have someplace to go?
- Yeah, the salmon run.

321
00:30:16.914 --> 00:30:20.152
How about this?
I get you down, then we go together.

322
00:30:20.187 --> 00:30:23.033
- Deal?
- Yeah, okay, fine.

323
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:26.395
If you can magically get me down,
I'll go with you to this...

324
00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:29.394
- Salmon run.
- Whatever. But if you can't...

325
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:33.597
You turn around, walk away,
and never come back, ever.

326
00:30:33.668 --> 00:30:35.353
- You swear?
- Yeah.

327
00:30:35.388 --> 00:30:38.236
- Pinky swear?
- Yeah, sure, fine, pinky swear.

328
00:30:38.308 --> 00:30:41.111
But this is a human trap
and you're just a dumb little bear.

329
00:30:41.187 --> 00:30:43.195
There's no way
you're going to be able...

330
00:30:48.624 --> 00:30:51.428
Okay, so I'm thinking
we travel by day and sleep by night.

331
00:30:51.503 --> 00:30:54.230
My bedtime is an hour after sunset...

332
00:30:56.302 --> 00:30:57.590
Run!

333
00:30:58.061 --> 00:30:59.785
Yeah, good riddance.

334
00:31:14.177 --> 00:31:15.502
Denahi.

335
00:31:15.537 --> 00:31:16.944
Denahi, you found me.

336
00:31:18.816 --> 00:31:20.583
You wouldn't believe
what a nightmare this has been.

337
00:31:22.215 --> 00:31:24.462
Denahi? It's me. Kenai.

338
00:31:56.246 --> 00:31:58.010
Is he gone?

339
00:31:58.045 --> 00:31:59.812
- I think he was going...
- Shh!

340
00:32:07.683 --> 00:32:09.723
Hello. I can't breathe.

341
00:32:23.878 --> 00:32:26.878
- Why is he chasing me?
- That's what they do.

342
00:32:26.957 --> 00:32:30.525
- But it's not like him.
- Lucky for him, he didn't find us

343
00:32:30.596 --> 00:32:33.280
'cause when I get in a fight,
I go all crazy

344
00:32:33.355 --> 00:32:35.722
and I'm a raging ball of brown fur.

345
00:32:36.674 --> 00:32:40.481
I mean, I don't want to brag or nothing,
but I got some moves.

346
00:32:40.913 --> 00:32:44.240
- Oh, really?
- Yep. This first one, well...

347
00:32:44.792 --> 00:32:48.735
It's just a little thing
I like to call "The Slasher."

348
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.679
And this one I like to call
"Flying Fury of Death."

349
00:32:52.949 --> 00:32:56.113
- Uh-huh. He's coming back.
- Where?

350
00:32:56.668 --> 00:32:58.752
Typical.

351
00:32:58.828 --> 00:33:01.948
Yeah, well,
the next time we run into that hunter...

352
00:33:02.027 --> 00:33:05.550
There is no "we."
I'm not taking you to any salmon run.

353
00:33:05.746 --> 00:33:08.113
What? But you pinky swore.

354
00:33:08.185 --> 00:33:09.865
Yeah, well, things change.

355
00:33:10.665 --> 00:33:12.105
See you, kid.

356
00:33:13.704 --> 00:33:14.751
Wait, uh...

357
00:33:18.223 --> 00:33:21.901
The truth is,
I got separated from my mom.

358
00:33:21.936 --> 00:33:24.546
And now, with this hunter around...

359
00:33:24.581 --> 00:33:28.508
- Kid, I got my own problems.
- Come on. Please.

360
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.300
Can't we just go together?
There's a lot of bears and a ton of fish,

361
00:33:32.379 --> 00:33:35.859
and every night we watch the lights
touch the mountain. Last year...

362
00:33:35.938 --> 00:33:38.857
- Wait, wait. What did you say?
- Lots of bears and fish.

363
00:33:38.892 --> 00:33:41.137
No. You know
where the lights touch the earth?

364
00:33:41.216 --> 00:33:44.060
Yeah! The top of the mountain
right by the salmon run.

365
00:33:44.095 --> 00:33:47.499
- You're kidding me.
- No, no, they're practically next door.

366
00:33:47.574 --> 00:33:49.854
Come on, I'll show you. It'll be great.

367
00:33:50.853 --> 00:33:54.257
I promise to help you escape
from every trap you walk into.

368
00:33:54.333 --> 00:33:55.980
I'm not going to walk into any more...

369
00:33:56.532 --> 00:34:01.256
- Traps.
- Come on. What do you say?

370
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.529
Sure you can take me
to where the lights touch the earth?

371
00:34:05.564 --> 00:34:07.296
Yeah, no problem.

372
00:34:12.688 --> 00:34:15.731
- If you slow me down...
- I won't, I promise.

373
00:34:16.806 --> 00:34:19.206
All right, we leave first thing tomorrow.

374
00:34:32.082 --> 00:34:34.961
And keep all that cuddly bear stuff
to a minimum, okay, kid?

375
00:34:34.996 --> 00:34:37.808
My name's not "kid." It's Koda.

376
00:34:45.318 --> 00:34:46.878
What's your name?

377
00:34:52.516 --> 00:34:54.163
- Good day.
- How's it going, eh?

378
00:34:54.236 --> 00:34:58.403
Beauty. So we got a lot to get done
today. You want to get started?

379
00:34:58.475 --> 00:35:00.394
- Yeah. Just give me one sec, eh?
- Okay.

380
00:35:01.594 --> 00:35:03.754
Woo-oo-hoo...

381
00:35:04.033 --> 00:35:06.040
- Just help me crack this.
- All right.

382
00:35:06.193 --> 00:35:07.557
Ah.

383
00:35:07.592 --> 00:35:09.839
- You ready now?
- Almost.

384
00:35:11.591 --> 00:35:14.035
Just want to do "dog facing forward."

385
00:35:14.271 --> 00:35:17.990
- Oh, come on.
- Good. Okay.

386
00:35:18.025 --> 00:35:19.550
And go.

387
00:35:21.549 --> 00:35:23.073
This a nice patch here.

388
00:35:23.108 --> 00:35:26.467
Don't go near this patch here.
Something went here.

389
00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:48.788
Ahh!

390
00:36:05.336 --> 00:36:08.020
Skinny. Fat. Skinny. Fat.

391
00:36:08.055 --> 00:36:10.935
Hey, I've got a mountain to get to.
Come on, kid.

392
00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:14.339
I told you before. My name's Koda.

393
00:36:14.413 --> 00:36:17.298
Say it with me. Ko... Da.

394
00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:20.213
Sure your mom didn't ditch you,
Ko-duh?

395
00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.452
Humph.

396
00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:31.096
- Rutt.
- Go away, eh, I'm eating twigs.

397
00:36:31.329 --> 00:36:34.296
- Rutt.
- You're breaking my concentration.

398
00:36:34.368 --> 00:36:37.008
We should start running, like now!

399
00:36:37.087 --> 00:36:41.331
I can't. I'm still digesting, eh.
I'll get cramps.

400
00:36:46.924 --> 00:36:50.251
- Whoa, gee! He's after us!
- Come on, little brother.

401
00:36:51.243 --> 00:36:52.683
Cramp!

402
00:36:53.643 --> 00:36:57.482
If you really want to know
how me and my mom got separated...

403
00:36:57.517 --> 00:37:01.321
I was saving this story
for the salmon run, but I'll tell you.

404
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.407
It was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life.

405
00:37:07.479 --> 00:37:10.446
- Sounds good. You should save it.
- You think so?

406
00:37:10.518 --> 00:37:12.841
- Oh, yeah. For your friends.
- Oh.

407
00:37:13.477 --> 00:37:15.876
- Well, I have this other story.
- Tell you what.

408
00:37:16.196 --> 00:37:18.956
- How about no talking?
- Okay.

409
00:37:19.555 --> 00:37:21.714
- Then I'll sing.
- No, no, no.

410
00:37:21.749 --> 00:37:23.874
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

411
00:37:23.909 --> 00:37:25.194
Will you stop it?

412
00:37:25.273 --> 00:37:27.273
<i>New friends and new places to see</i>

413
00:37:27.308 --> 00:37:29.450
Come on, quit it. Shh!

414
00:37:29.485 --> 00:37:31.738
Koda, stop singing.

415
00:37:31.773 --> 00:37:33.992
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

416
00:37:34.071 --> 00:37:38.271
<i>And there's nowhere else
that I'd rather be</i>

417
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.193
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

418
00:37:43.228 --> 00:37:46.916
<i>And I'm loving every step I take</i>

419
00:37:47.548 --> 00:37:51.714
<i>With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way</i>

420
00:37:52.226 --> 00:37:56.034
<i>And I can't keep this smile off my face</i>

421
00:37:56.585 --> 00:38:01.025
<i>'Cause there's nothing like
seeing each other again</i>

422
00:38:01.343 --> 00:38:04.911
<i>No matter what the distance between</i>

423
00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:12.069
<i>And the stories that we tell
will make you smile</i>

424
00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:15.948
<i>Oh, it really lifts my heart</i>

425
00:38:16.019 --> 00:38:19.379
<i>So tell them all I'm on my way</i>

426
00:38:19.458 --> 00:38:23.582
<i>New friends and new places to see</i>

427
00:38:23.657 --> 00:38:28.381
<i>And to sleep under the stars
Who could ask for more?</i>

428
00:38:28.456 --> 00:38:31.859
<i>With the moon keeping watch over me</i>

429
00:38:32.615 --> 00:38:37.493
<i>Not the snow, not the rain
can change my mind</i>

430
00:38:37.528 --> 00:38:41.617
<i>The sun will come out, wait and see</i>

431
00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:45.295
<i>And the feeling of the wind in your face</i>

432
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:48.975
<i>Can lift your heart, whoa</i>

433
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:51.977
<i>There's nowhere I would rather be</i>

434
00:38:54.368 --> 00:38:56.975
<i>'Cause I'm on my way now</i>

435
00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:01.331
<i>Well and true</i>

436
00:39:03.686 --> 00:39:05.889
<i>I'm on my way now</i>

437
00:39:07.045 --> 00:39:09.293
Hey, hold on, eh?

438
00:39:09.365 --> 00:39:10.444
Wait up.

439
00:39:12.724 --> 00:39:15.423
- How's it going, bear boy?
- And, uh, smallish bear.

440
00:39:15.458 --> 00:39:18.123
I didn't know you had a little brother.
He's cute.

441
00:39:18.203 --> 00:39:21.966
- Actually, he's...
- There was this hunter following us.

442
00:39:22.041 --> 00:39:25.160
We was thinking if we could
maybe just hang out with you guys.

443
00:39:25.195 --> 00:39:27.680
- Just hang out.
- Yeah, it'd be fun.

444
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.879
- If the hunter was going to catch up...
- Then you'd eat him.

445
00:39:30.959 --> 00:39:34.406
- That's what we was thinking.
- We lost the hunter at the glacier.

446
00:39:34.478 --> 00:39:36.277
You don't think he'll follow those?

447
00:39:36.837 --> 00:39:40.884
- They are quite nice.
- I've got an idea.

448
00:39:40.956 --> 00:39:43.236
Okay, this is really weird.

449
00:39:44.475 --> 00:39:47.518
- I'm driving.
- When can I have a turn?

450
00:39:47.553 --> 00:39:50.553
It's not as easy as it looks.
Just watch what I do.

451
00:39:50.633 --> 00:39:54.080
Let's get a back seat or something.
I look like you hunted me.

452
00:39:54.712 --> 00:39:57.635
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

453
00:39:57.711 --> 00:39:58.954
Hey, come on.

454
00:39:59.031 --> 00:40:01.791
<i>And I just can't wait to be there</i>

455
00:40:03.509 --> 00:40:07.349
<i>Blue skies ahead
Yes, I'm on my way</i>

456
00:40:07.948 --> 00:40:12.235
<i>Nothing but good times to share</i>

457
00:40:12.307 --> 00:40:15.831
<i>So tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

458
00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:19.826
<i>And I just can't wait to be home</i>

459
00:40:21.225 --> 00:40:25.348
<i>With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way</i>

460
00:40:25.903 --> 00:40:29.742
<i>With nothing but good times to show</i>

461
00:40:29.777 --> 00:40:33.026
<i>I'm on my way</i>

462
00:40:33.101 --> 00:40:36.744
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

463
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.187
Beauty, eh?

464
00:40:40.459 --> 00:40:43.978
Okay, here's how I remember it.
The snow is white, it's all right.

465
00:40:44.013 --> 00:40:46.377
Yellow or green, it's just not clean.

466
00:40:46.412 --> 00:40:47.981
I learned that one the hard way.

467
00:40:48.296 --> 00:40:52.463
That reminds me. Last year at the
salmon run my friend Bucky dared me.

468
00:40:52.536 --> 00:40:55.535
But I'd heard of a cub
who stuck his tongue to an iceberg.

469
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.379
Then he started to float away.

470
00:40:57.414 --> 00:41:00.139
To save him
they had to rip off his tongue,

471
00:41:00.174 --> 00:41:03.021
so now he hath to talk like thith
all the time and...

472
00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:05.820
- Do you ever stop talking?
- Oh!

473
00:41:05.892 --> 00:41:08.296
Look. The night rainbow.

474
00:41:08.331 --> 00:41:12.291
- You can see the spirits from here.
- You know about the great spirits?

475
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:15.490
Yeah, my grandma's up there,
and my granddad.

476
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:20.056
Mom says the spirits make
all the magical changes in the world.

477
00:41:20.248 --> 00:41:23.847
Like how the leaves change colour,
or the moon changes shapes,

478
00:41:23.882 --> 00:41:27.370
- or tadpoles change into frogs.
- Yeah, I get it.

479
00:41:27.446 --> 00:41:31.845
You know, for a change, maybe
they could just leave things alone.

480
00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.725
- What do you mean?
- My brother's a spirit.

481
00:41:35.524 --> 00:41:37.607
If it wasn't for him, I...

482
00:41:37.683 --> 00:41:39.483
I wouldn't be here.

483
00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:41.691
You have a brother up there?

484
00:41:43.242 --> 00:41:46.885
- What happened to him?
- He was killed by a...

485
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.200
By a monster.

486
00:41:55.478 --> 00:41:57.485
What's your brother's name?

487
00:41:57.557 --> 00:41:59.602
Sitka.

488
00:41:59.637 --> 00:42:03.716
Thanks, Sitka. If it weren't for you,
I would have never met Kenai.

489
00:42:08.995 --> 00:42:11.438
I always wanted a brother.

490
00:42:30.508 --> 00:42:32.592
So, you want to play "I spy"?

491
00:42:33.148 --> 00:42:35.471
- All right. I'll go first.
- Okay.

492
00:42:35.547 --> 00:42:39.190
I spy something green.

493
00:42:41.386 --> 00:42:42.630
- Tree?
- Oh!

494
00:42:42.665 --> 00:42:43.832
- My turn?
- Yeah.

495
00:42:43.904 --> 00:42:46.785
Okay, I spy something tall.

496
00:42:48.303 --> 00:42:49.667
- Tree.
- Okay.

497
00:42:50.143 --> 00:42:54.583
I spy something with bark.

498
00:42:54.662 --> 00:42:55.946
Tree?

499
00:42:55.981 --> 00:42:58.545
Okay, I spy something, uh...

500
00:42:58.621 --> 00:43:00.868
- A vertical log.
- Tree.

501
00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.104
- Okay, I spy something...
- Tree.

502
00:43:04.659 --> 00:43:05.902
- My turn.
- Tree.

503
00:43:05.978 --> 00:43:07.145
- No, I...
- It counts.

504
00:43:07.218 --> 00:43:09.465
- I didn't even spy anything.
- It counts.

505
00:43:09.537 --> 00:43:11.697
Okay. Tree.

506
00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:14.976
Let's play something else.

507
00:43:20.735 --> 00:43:23.822
Koda. Come on.

508
00:43:23.894 --> 00:43:27.058
- Koda, wake up.
- Two more months, Mom.

509
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:32.495
So, where are we?

510
00:43:39.929 --> 00:43:41.893
Well, which way?

511
00:43:43.448 --> 00:43:46.328
- I think it's that way.
- You think, or you know?

512
00:43:47.327 --> 00:43:48.407
That way?

513
00:43:49.646 --> 00:43:51.774
Why wasn't I turned
into a homing pigeon?

514
00:43:52.006 --> 00:43:55.290
- Come on.
- Hey, riding mammoths was your idea.

515
00:43:55.365 --> 00:43:57.689
Thanks for the ride, guys. See you.

516
00:43:57.724 --> 00:44:00.168
Lucky for you,
I've been lost worse than this.

517
00:44:00.243 --> 00:44:03.322
- Last summer, I was with Bucky...
- Enough with the stories.

518
00:44:03.357 --> 00:44:05.682
I don't care about the time
you and Binky found

519
00:44:05.717 --> 00:44:08.126
the world's biggest pine cone ever.

520
00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:11.921
First of all, his name's Bucky, not Binky.

521
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.367
Second, it wasn't a pine cone,
it was a pine nut.

522
00:44:14.439 --> 00:44:17.363
And it was huge.
Even bigger than your fat head.

523
00:44:17.798 --> 00:44:19.958
Oh, gee,
our big guardian bear is leaving, eh?

524
00:44:20.038 --> 00:44:22.318
Yeah. We'd better follow him. Come on.

525
00:44:22.397 --> 00:44:25.396
- Can you swing your leg...
- I can't get off.

526
00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:28.080
Me, neither. Okay, you guys...

527
00:44:28.115 --> 00:44:31.955
I guess we'll just catch up
with those guys later, eh?

528
00:44:32.194 --> 00:44:34.798
- Good trip, eh?
- Beauty.

529
00:44:34.833 --> 00:44:38.554
You know, I was thinking now
might be a good time for me to drive.

530
00:44:38.632 --> 00:44:41.076
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

531
00:44:41.152 --> 00:44:42.799
Yeah. Okay.

532
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:45.031
Whee.

533
00:44:45.551 --> 00:44:48.474
I'm sorry we're lost, okay?

534
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.309
- Even though it's your fault.
- My fault?

535
00:44:51.344 --> 00:44:52.717
That's it.

536
00:44:52.788 --> 00:44:56.312
Just remember, if it weren't for me,
you'd be hanging upside down.

537
00:44:56.388 --> 00:45:00.227
Better than being stuck nowhere
with you and your blabbering mouth.

538
00:45:00.262 --> 00:45:04.066
"I'm lost. I can't find my mommy.
Will you take me to the salmon run?"

539
00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:06.989
- Why don't you just grow up?
- Fine. I'll go on my own then.

540
00:45:07.065 --> 00:45:09.184
- Fine. Go ahead.
- Fine.

541
00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:10.472
- Fine.
- Fine.

542
00:45:27.419 --> 00:45:28.827
Koda?

543
00:45:29.498 --> 00:45:30.938
Koda?

544
00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:40.060
Whoa.

545
00:46:33.201 --> 00:46:35.601
Those monsters are really scary.

546
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.764
Especially with those sticks.

547
00:46:55.155 --> 00:46:57.282
Come on, let's go.

548
00:47:00.353 --> 00:47:01.641
So, you recognise anything yet?

549
00:47:02.033 --> 00:47:04.356
Or maybe you can't see past
my fat head.

550
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:09.991
So, do you really think
I have a fat head?

551
00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:13.310
Well, if you hunched your shoulders
a little it wouldn't seem so big.

552
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.748
Oh, you mean like this?

553
00:47:15.783 --> 00:47:17.548
Or like this?

554
00:47:17.628 --> 00:47:19.548
How about this?

555
00:47:20.147 --> 00:47:22.591
Oh, my, that was good.

556
00:47:22.626 --> 00:47:24.667
Maybe they can
give us directions.

557
00:47:24.826 --> 00:47:26.670
Oh!

558
00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:28.744
- That clears up the sinuses.
- Oh, it does.

559
00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.709
Okay, okay, hit me again.
I think she's looking.

560
00:47:30.744 --> 00:47:34.943
- Hello, sweetie.
- Yes, she's checking me out, all right.

561
00:47:34.978 --> 00:47:37.310
- Hey, baby.
- No, come on, you nitwit.

562
00:47:37.383 --> 00:47:39.586
Are you out of your head?
She's looking at me.

563
00:47:39.662 --> 00:47:42.509
Like she's looking at your ugly mug?
Come on.

564
00:47:42.581 --> 00:47:44.829
Excuse me, miss. It's go-time, baby.

565
00:47:44.901 --> 00:47:46.820
You want to go? Bring it on.

566
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.504
- Horns up.
- Hold on.

567
00:47:48.819 --> 00:47:51.219
- Excuse me.
- What do you want?

568
00:47:51.459 --> 00:47:53.826
- What is that?
- Just a minute, bear.

569
00:47:53.898 --> 00:47:57.377
Hey, shut up.

570
00:47:57.412 --> 00:48:00.821
No, you shut up.

571
00:48:00.856 --> 00:48:02.775
Hey, will you shut up?

572
00:48:03.456 --> 00:48:06.095
Just shut up.

573
00:48:06.175 --> 00:48:08.455
Their horns are screwed on too tight.

574
00:48:10.453 --> 00:48:12.656
Oh, wait a second.

575
00:48:13.772 --> 00:48:16.095
- I know this place.
- You do?

576
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.419
Yeah. The salmon run's not far.

577
00:48:19.291 --> 00:48:21.658
We just have to go through here.

578
00:48:34.407 --> 00:48:35.695
What?

579
00:48:38.885 --> 00:48:41.444
Hey, you sure you know
where you're going?

580
00:48:41.479 --> 00:48:43.364
Yeah, yeah, follow me.

581
00:48:50.483 --> 00:48:51.966
Koda?

582
00:48:54.361 --> 00:48:56.008
Koda?

583
00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.603
Koda?

584
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.119
Where are you?

585
00:49:05.518 --> 00:49:07.798
Yah!

586
00:49:09.437 --> 00:49:12.656
- Don't do that.
- Scared you, didn't I?

587
00:49:12.691 --> 00:49:15.876
There's scared,
and then there's surprised.

588
00:49:15.955 --> 00:49:17.875
And you were both.

589
00:49:18.874 --> 00:49:19.998
Whoa!

590
00:49:29.672 --> 00:49:33.838
Nice try.
Uh, you got a little spit right there.

591
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:40.069
- Kenai!
- You're not getting me this time.

592
00:49:40.148 --> 00:49:41.468
No, look out.

593
00:49:46.147 --> 00:49:47.227
No.

594
00:49:47.946 --> 00:49:49.506
Come on.

595
00:50:03.382 --> 00:50:04.429
Kenai.

596
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.264
Kenai, where are you?

597
00:50:19.178 --> 00:50:21.665
Left. Left. No, the other left.

598
00:50:34.613 --> 00:50:35.660
Kenai!

599
00:50:40.611 --> 00:50:42.291
Whoa! Whoa!

600
00:50:57.247 --> 00:50:58.851
No!

601
00:51:03.325 --> 00:51:05.486
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here.

602
00:51:07.044 --> 00:51:08.210
Ah!

603
00:52:11.746 --> 00:52:13.590
Why do they hate us, Kenai?

604
00:52:13.666 --> 00:52:15.706
- We're bears.
- So?

605
00:52:15.785 --> 00:52:18.864
So, you know how they are.
They're killers.

606
00:52:18.899 --> 00:52:21.112
Wait a minute, who's the killers?

607
00:52:21.184 --> 00:52:23.464
- Bears.
- What? Which bears?

608
00:52:23.543 --> 00:52:25.583
I'm not like that, and you're not like that.

609
00:52:25.662 --> 00:52:28.585
Well, obviously not all bears.
I mean, you're okay.

610
00:52:29.061 --> 00:52:32.900
Most bears will look for any excuse
to attack a human.

611
00:52:32.935 --> 00:52:35.464
But, Kenai, he attacked us.

612
00:52:37.818 --> 00:52:40.298
You're just a cub.
When you're older, you'll understand.

613
00:52:40.333 --> 00:52:42.905
Fish! Fish! Fish!

614
00:52:42.977 --> 00:52:45.225
- Huh?
- We made it. We're here.

615
00:52:45.297 --> 00:52:47.500
- Come on!
- What? Koda.

616
00:52:47.616 --> 00:52:50.659
- Fish! Fish! Fish!
- Hey. Get away from me.

617
00:52:51.495 --> 00:52:53.818
Get away from me. Go on. Shoo!

618
00:53:13.289 --> 00:53:14.494
Huh?

619
00:53:14.529 --> 00:53:17.373
Hey, you're stirring up the water, dude.

620
00:53:17.408 --> 00:53:20.168
Yeah, try not to scare off
the fish there, buddy.

621
00:53:20.687 --> 00:53:22.050
- Uh...
- Tug.

622
00:53:22.126 --> 00:53:24.690
Hey, Koda. Come here.

623
00:53:25.245 --> 00:53:26.652
Look at you.

624
00:53:27.285 --> 00:53:31.125
- Have you seen my mom yet?
- No, as a matter of fact I haven't.

625
00:53:32.003 --> 00:53:35.604
- Me and my friend Kenai beat her.
- He's with you?

626
00:53:36.242 --> 00:53:38.042
Uh... Hi.

627
00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:42.409
Huh. I've never seen you
at the run before.

628
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:46.125
- Where are you from?
- Well, I...

629
00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.963
There's the mountain,
just like I promised.

630
00:53:49.039 --> 00:53:51.002
The lights touch the top every night.

631
00:53:51.838 --> 00:53:54.686
Gonna be harder getting up there
than riding those mammoths.

632
00:53:54.757 --> 00:53:56.437
- Mammoths?
- Are you kidding?

633
00:53:56.472 --> 00:53:58.161
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

634
00:53:58.196 --> 00:54:01.676
He does weird stuff.
Like the way he drinks water with a leaf.

635
00:54:01.755 --> 00:54:05.355
He never sharpens his claws on a tree.
He's never hibernated before...

636
00:54:05.434 --> 00:54:07.834
Koda. Koda.

637
00:54:07.913 --> 00:54:10.793
Can I talk to you for a second?
Excuse us.

638
00:54:11.553 --> 00:54:14.312
Hmm. He's kind of jumpy, isn't he?

639
00:54:14.347 --> 00:54:16.395
Okay. Okay.

640
00:54:16.551 --> 00:54:18.155
Koda, I, uh...

641
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:22.710
- Uh, I got to get going.
- Well, when you come back...

642
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:24.873
I... I won't be coming back.

643
00:54:24.949 --> 00:54:26.956
What? Why not?

644
00:54:28.348 --> 00:54:31.307
Because... Well, it's hard to...

645
00:54:31.342 --> 00:54:33.507
- You're leaving?
- No.

646
00:54:33.542 --> 00:54:35.667
Well, I mean, yes.

647
00:54:35.745 --> 00:54:38.025
Well, it's just that I...

648
00:54:38.105 --> 00:54:41.664
- I don't belong here.
- Don't belong?

649
00:54:41.699 --> 00:54:45.223
Every bear belongs here.
Come on, buddy.

650
00:54:45.258 --> 00:54:46.390
<i>Everyone's invited</i>

651
00:54:46.463 --> 00:54:47.586

669
00:55:51.085 --> 00:55:54.089

<i>Finding love, planning a future</i>

678
00:56:24.795 --> 00:56:28.198
<i>Telling stories

<i>This has to be the most beautiful</i>

681
00:56:35.912 --> 00:56:40.320
<i>The most peaceful place
I've ever been to</i>

682
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:45.638
<i>It's nothing like I've ever seen before</i>

683
00:56:47.229 --> 00:56:51.233
<i>When I think how far I've come
I can't believe it</i>

684
00:56:51.867 --> 00:56:53.350
<i>Yet I see it</i>

685
00:56:53.987 --> 00:56:57.630
<i>And then I see family</i>

686
00:56:57.706 --> 00:57:01.589
<i>I see the way we used to be</i>

687
00:57:02.984 --> 00:57:07.583
<i>- Come on
- Welcome to our family time</i>

688
00:57:07.618 --> 00:57:11.271
<i>Welcome to our brotherly time</i>

689
00:57:11.342 --> 00:57:16.181
<i>We're happy giving and taking
to the friends that we're making</i>

690
00:57:16.216 --> 00:57:18.668
<i>There's nothing we won't do</i>

691
00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.385
<i>Welcome to our family time</i>

692
00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:26.103
<i>Welcome to our happy-to-be time</i>

693
00:57:26.138 --> 00:57:30.981
<i>This is our festival
You know, and best of all</i>

694
00:57:31.057 --> 00:57:33.337
<i>You're here to share it</i>

695
00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:37.223
<i>We're here to share it all</i>

696
00:57:44.453 --> 00:57:48.500
All right, settle down, everyone.
Settle down. Hey.

697
00:57:48.572 --> 00:57:51.211
Don't throw your fish bones there.
Somebody could choke on that.

698
00:57:51.246 --> 00:57:52.975
Look, okay, I'll go first.

699
00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:57.450
Okay, let's see. The most interesting
thing that happened to me this year.

700
00:57:57.569 --> 00:57:59.174
Hmm...

701
00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:01.369
Oh, I know, I know, I know! Listen to this.

702
00:58:01.448 --> 00:58:03.771
It was when I knocked down that tree

703
00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:05.975
that was blocking the view
from my cave.

704
00:58:06.407 --> 00:58:09.407
Now I got a family of chipmunks
staying in my place.

705
00:58:12.205 --> 00:58:13.852
Yeah.

706
00:58:13.925 --> 00:58:16.564
All right, everybody,
let me see some paws in the air.

707
00:58:16.644 --> 00:58:19.567
- Who's gonna be next? Come on.
- Tug. I got one.

708
00:58:19.643 --> 00:58:22.490
Watch me. Hey, gotcha.

709
00:58:22.922 --> 00:58:27.242
This year I lost my dear husband Edgar.

710
00:58:27.321 --> 00:58:29.808
Quit telling everyone I'm dead!

711
00:58:29.881 --> 00:58:34.399
Sometimes I can still hear his voice.

712
00:58:34.434 --> 00:58:36.003
I'm getting the next one.

713
00:58:48.275 --> 00:58:50.118
Oh, yeah.

714
00:58:52.234 --> 00:58:56.473
- This is it. I got it. I got...
- I guess it's our turn.

715
00:58:56.508 --> 00:58:59.672
This is the year
I met the most gorgeous...

716
00:58:59.707 --> 00:59:01.716
No, you're gorgeous.

717
00:59:01.751 --> 00:59:05.275
- You're gorgeous-er.
- Get a cave.

718
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:08.794
If only Edgar was alive...

719
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:11.349
I told you, woman,
I'm right here!

720
00:59:11.429 --> 00:59:15.087
- I love you, buttercup.
- This has got to be it.

721
00:59:15.122 --> 00:59:18.746
- Here you go, Koda.
- You gotta tell it, Kenai.

722
00:59:18.781 --> 00:59:21.790
- What?
- Yes. You caught it, you tell it.

723
00:59:21.865 --> 00:59:23.665
Didn't you play when you were a cub?

724
00:59:23.906 --> 00:59:25.989
- Um...
- Come on, Keno.

725
00:59:28.784 --> 00:59:30.628
Okay, all right already. All right.

726
00:59:31.263 --> 00:59:33.586
- You want to know what I did this year?
- Yes.

727
00:59:33.662 --> 00:59:38.549
I went on the longest, hardest, most
exhausting journey I've ever been on

728
00:59:38.621 --> 00:59:41.905
with the biggest pain in the neck
I've ever met.

729
00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.063
What do you expect
from a little brother?

730
00:59:48.178 --> 00:59:50.097
Okay, buddy, your turn.

731
00:59:50.738 --> 00:59:53.618
- Let's hear it, Koda.
- Okay, okay, here we go.

732
00:59:55.137 --> 00:59:57.896
This year I watched my mom
in a life-and-death struggle

733
00:59:57.931 --> 01:00:00.654
battling the most fiercest creature ever.

734
01:00:00.689 --> 01:00:02.258
- Who's next?
- What?

735
01:00:02.334 --> 01:00:06.893
Wait a minute. I think we all want
to hear the rest of that one, Koda.

736
01:00:06.928 --> 01:00:10.417
I thought you might say that.
Hmm... Let's see.

737
01:00:10.492 --> 01:00:14.856
It was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life.

738
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:17.898
Me and Mom were eating fish,
having a great time.

739
01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:22.737
All of a sudden she pushes me into
the bushes and tells me to be real quiet.

740
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:26.492
She says, "I smell something."
So I started sniffing.

741
01:00:27.488 --> 01:00:30.051
There's something in the woods
running towards us,

742
01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.527
getting closer and closer.

743
01:00:34.206 --> 01:00:38.089
And then, out of the trees,
jumps a hunter.

744
01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:42.648
And now there's nowhere for Mom to go.

745
01:00:42.683 --> 01:00:46.283
The monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier.

746
01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:54.045
The monster attacks,
but Mom's too quick for him.

747
01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.447
And before he can do it again, she
stands up real big and yells, "Go away."

748
01:00:59.518 --> 01:01:01.318
<i>Kenai.</i>

749
01:01:01.398 --> 01:01:03.077
Mom smells more of them.

750
01:01:03.158 --> 01:01:05.077
There's a whole pack
coming right at us.

751
01:01:05.557 --> 01:01:07.476
Sitka, no. The bear. Behind you.

752
01:01:07.557 --> 01:01:09.804
<i>She runs to stop them
before they get to me.</i>

753
01:01:09.876 --> 01:01:12.799
<i>They're all around her,
poking her with sticks.</i>

754
01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:16.518
<i>- Sitka.
- The whole thing broke and fell off.</i>

755
01:01:16.594 --> 01:01:18.361
<i>There was ice everywhere.</i>

756
01:01:18.433 --> 01:01:21.037
<i>She couldn't hold her breath
any longer, and pow.</i>

757
01:01:21.072 --> 01:01:24.912
She bursts out of the water.
I've never been so scared in my life.

758
01:01:25.191 --> 01:01:27.995
<i>- I'm going after the bear.
- Koda?</i>

759
01:01:28.071 --> 01:01:29.910
<i>- Sitka wouldn't want it.
- Sitka's not here</i>

760
01:01:29.945 --> 01:01:31.917
<i>because of that monster.</i>

761
01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:37.428
Whoa. Fell off a glacier?
I've never seen anything like that.

762
01:01:37.463 --> 01:01:39.468
Can you imagine?

763
01:01:40.107 --> 01:01:42.671
Kenai. What's the matter, Kenai?

764
01:01:42.747 --> 01:01:45.266
- What happened next?
- Was she okay?

765
01:01:46.346 --> 01:01:49.585
Hey, Kenai, what's wrong?
Where you going?

766
01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:52.784
She got out of the water okay.
That's how we got separated.

767
01:01:52.819 --> 01:01:55.663
Right after that I met Kenai.

768
01:01:55.698 --> 01:01:56.787
Kenai?

769
01:02:39.811 --> 01:02:43.291
Scared you again, huh?

770
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:45.089
- Yeah.
- Where have you been?

771
01:02:45.124 --> 01:02:46.774
- You look horrible.
- Koda...

772
01:02:46.809 --> 01:02:49.689
My mom says when
you eat too much fish, just lie down.

773
01:02:52.007 --> 01:02:53.927
There's something I, uh...

774
01:02:54.887 --> 01:02:56.970
You know that story
you told me last night?

775
01:02:57.046 --> 01:03:00.245
- Yeah.
- Well, I have a story to tell you.

776
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.489
Really? What's it about?

777
01:03:02.524 --> 01:03:05.567
Well, it's kind of about a man,

778
01:03:05.643 --> 01:03:08.130
and kind of about a bear.

779
01:03:08.203 --> 01:03:11.126
But mostly it's about a monster.

780
01:03:12.401 --> 01:03:15.460
A monster who did something so bad...

781
01:03:15.495 --> 01:03:18.520
<i>Everywhere I turn I hurt someone</i>

782
01:03:19.759 --> 01:03:25.203
<i>But there's nothing I can say
to change the things I've done</i>

783
01:03:26.317 --> 01:03:29.721
<i>I'd do anything within my power</i>

784
01:03:29.796 --> 01:03:32.796
<i>I'd give everything I've got</i>

785
01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:37.283
<i>But the path I seek
is hidden from me now</i>

786
01:03:37.354 --> 01:03:40.442
Koda, I did something very wrong.

787
01:03:40.514 --> 01:03:43.356
<i>Brother bear, I let you down</i>

788
01:03:43.391 --> 01:03:46.199
I don't like this story.

789
01:03:46.272 --> 01:03:51.111
<i>You trusted me, believed in me
and I let you down</i>

790
01:03:51.146 --> 01:03:52.715
Your mother's not coming.

791
01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:55.997
<i>Of all the things I hid from you</i>

792
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:58.708
<i>I cannot hide the shame</i>

793
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:59.948
<i>And I pray someone</i>

794
01:03:59.983 --> 01:04:01.033
No. No!

795
01:04:01.068 --> 01:04:06.151
<i>Something will come
to take away the pain</i>

796
01:04:06.826 --> 01:04:10.153
<i>There's no way out</i>

797
01:04:10.225 --> 01:04:13.345
<i>Of this dark place</i>

798
01:04:13.424 --> 01:04:16.828
<i>No, no future</i>

799
01:04:20.062 --> 01:04:25.190
<i>I know I can't be free</i>

800
01:04:27.301 --> 01:04:30.781
<i>But I can't see another way</i>

801
01:04:32.219 --> 01:04:36.866
<i>And I can't face another day</i>

802
01:04:39.497 --> 01:04:42.345
Koda? Koda?

803
01:04:44.296 --> 01:04:45.976
Koda!

804
01:04:50.014 --> 01:04:51.574
Koda, I wish I could...

805
01:04:52.654 --> 01:04:55.260
If there was just some way...

806
01:04:56.412 --> 01:04:57.895
I'd give anything if...

807
01:05:00.891 --> 01:05:03.291
If I could just...

808
01:05:14.608 --> 01:05:16.855
I'm sorry, Koda.

809
01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.094
I'm so sorry.

810
01:05:54.795 --> 01:05:56.715
I'm sorry, Kenai.

811
01:05:57.315 --> 01:05:59.399
I don't know what I'm doing any more.

812
01:06:00.395 --> 01:06:02.314
I need help.

813
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:17.350
Sitka.

814
01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:29.272
Look, I am sorry.

815
01:06:29.307 --> 01:06:31.226
If I was driving
this never would have happened.

816
01:06:31.306 --> 01:06:36.433
- You never let me do nothing.
- Trample off. I said sorry. Let it go.

817
01:06:36.504 --> 01:06:38.709
I can't believe you totalled a mammoth.

818
01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:42.191
- That mountain came out of nowhere.
- I cannot accept your apology.

819
01:06:42.262 --> 01:06:45.863
- It was in my blind spot...
- Look. It's that little cub.

820
01:06:46.862 --> 01:06:49.785
- Gee, eh, something's bugging him.
- What's wrong, smallish bear?

821
01:06:50.181 --> 01:06:52.341
Nothing. I'm fine.

822
01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:57.618
Good. Where were we? Oh, yeah.
You're a big, selfish, reckless hoofer.

823
01:06:57.653 --> 01:06:59.626
- What?
- I'm fed up with it.

824
01:06:59.858 --> 01:07:03.217
- From now on, he's my new brother.
- You can't do that.

825
01:07:03.297 --> 01:07:06.775
Sorry, you've been replaced
with my dear brother...

826
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:08.542
What's your name again?

827
01:07:08.615 --> 01:07:10.895
I don't want any more brothers.

828
01:07:10.975 --> 01:07:14.662
- See? He's had enough of you, too.
- I promise I'll change.

829
01:07:14.733 --> 01:07:18.333
Trample off. You won't.
Being a brother means nothing to you.

830
01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:20.617
- Of course it does.
- Like what?

831
01:07:20.652 --> 01:07:23.052
What about when your hooves
froze in the pond?

832
01:07:23.131 --> 01:07:26.491
- Who sat with you all winter, eh?
- You did.

833
01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:28.654
Who showed you
where the good grazing is?

834
01:07:28.729 --> 01:07:32.013
The really tender stuff
all covered in dew.

835
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:34.653
Now, why do you think I did that, eh?

836
01:07:34.728 --> 01:07:36.613
Because I...

837
01:07:36.648 --> 01:07:39.451
Because I love... dew.

838
01:07:39.527 --> 01:07:42.854
Excuse me?
I don't believe I heard what you said.

839
01:07:42.966 --> 01:07:45.846
I said, "I love dew."

840
01:07:46.485 --> 01:07:48.732
I love dew, too, eh.

841
01:07:49.963 --> 01:07:52.328
Hey, I can change.

842
01:07:52.363 --> 01:07:55.647
- Go away, eh.
- Come on, I can change.

843
01:07:55.682 --> 01:07:59.283
- Go away, eh, don't touch me.
- I can change.

844
01:07:59.361 --> 01:08:01.041
Hey. No.

845
01:08:01.121 --> 01:08:03.084
Not there, that's the spot.

846
01:08:04.959 --> 01:08:06.684
Like, we'll see you later, smallish bear.

847
01:08:06.719 --> 01:08:10.482
Yeah, good day, eh.
You know what this calls for?

848
01:08:10.558 --> 01:08:14.757
A pile of delicious barley and amber
weed on a cool bed of malted hops.

849
01:08:14.837 --> 01:08:16.756
I like it.

850
01:08:32.552 --> 01:08:35.039
Sitka! Sitka, are you there?

851
01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:37.714
Sitka?

852
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:43.034
Please. Please, Sitka.

853
01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:44.988
I don't know what else to do.

854
01:08:49.107 --> 01:08:50.308
Sitka.

855
01:08:56.945 --> 01:08:58.145
Denahi.

856
01:09:00.145 --> 01:09:02.064
Sitka, hurry, change me back.

857
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.820
Where are you, Sitka?

858
01:09:37.893 --> 01:09:39.017
Denahi.

859
01:09:40.493 --> 01:09:42.053
Denahi, please.

860
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:47.450
Koda.

861
01:09:58.128 --> 01:09:59.568
No!

862
01:10:01.567 --> 01:10:03.095
Leave him alone.

863
01:10:06.046 --> 01:10:07.366
Koda!

864
01:10:32.158 --> 01:10:33.718
Kenai?

865
01:10:50.234 --> 01:10:51.717
Sitka?

866
01:11:14.986 --> 01:11:19.307
Koda, don't be afraid. It's me.

867
01:12:05.012 --> 01:12:06.976
He needs me.

868
01:12:08.571 --> 01:12:11.931
You know, he did look better as a bear.

869
01:12:21.528 --> 01:12:24.615
But, Denahi...

870
01:12:25.286 --> 01:12:27.086
It's all right, Kenai.

871
01:12:34.524 --> 01:12:38.724
No matter what you choose,
you'll always be my little brother.

872
01:12:57.878 --> 01:12:59.166
Did I say little?

873
01:13:31.828 --> 01:13:33.388
Kenai.

874
01:13:58.621 --> 01:14:03.508
<i>My brother Kenai went on
to live with Koda and the other bears.</i>

875
01:14:03.579 --> 01:14:07.147
<i>He taught me
that love is very powerful.</i>

876
01:14:08.258 --> 01:14:11.825
<i>And I passed on the wisdom
of his story to our people.</i>

877
01:14:13.097 --> 01:14:16.064
<i>The story of a boy who became a man</i>

878
01:14:16.816 --> 01:14:18.779
<i>by becoming a bear.</i>

879
01:14:19.175 --> 01:14:22.174
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

880
01:14:22.209 --> 01:14:24.858
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

881
01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:29.780
<i>Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know</i>

882
01:14:30.212 --> 01:14:32.891
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

883
01:14:32.926 --> 01:14:35.535
<i>We are all the same</i>

884
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:40.577
<i>Brothers to each other
in this world we remain</i>

885
01:14:40.649 --> 01:14:43.497
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

886
01:14:43.568 --> 01:14:48.335
<i>Brothers all the same</i>

887
01:15:00.164 --> 01:15:02.923
So, like, uh, what are you doing there,
smallish bear?

888
01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:05.482
I'm practising my moves.
Want to see one?

889
01:15:05.517 --> 01:15:07.969
Sure, eh.
This ought to be good, eh?

890
01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:16.723
Listen to me. I was a man
that was changed into a bear.

891
01:15:16.799 --> 01:15:20.082
No beaver. Man into bear. That's it.

892
01:15:20.158 --> 01:15:24.077
Oh. Yeah, so, before that
you was probably like a goat?

893
01:15:24.112 --> 01:15:26.281
- What about a water buffalo?
- No, he's a rabbit.

894
01:15:26.316 --> 01:15:29.675
Look at his ears and furry feet.
Watch out for the rabbit, eh.

895
01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:30.920
No way, eh.

896
01:15:30.955 --> 01:15:34.642
Okay, now, everyone,
take a big inhale, eh?

897
01:15:34.714 --> 01:15:36.122
And then on...

898
01:15:36.194 --> 01:15:40.241
On the exhale,
shift into salutation to the sun.

899
01:15:42.752 --> 01:15:48.119
No, you shut up.

900
01:15:56.788 --> 01:15:59.875
- How you doing over there, Koda?
- Oh, pretty good.
