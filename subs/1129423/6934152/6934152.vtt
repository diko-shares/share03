1
00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.891
All right, sweet pea, it's
time for you to go to bed.

2
00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.395
Mommy, would you ask
Daddy to come tuck me in?

3
00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:53.897
No, he's at work
tonight at the fire station.

4
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.099
But he'll be home
tomorrow night.

5
00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.435
Mommy, I want to marry Daddy.

6
00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:00.103
Ha-ha-ha. You do?

7
00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:01.905
Catherine, you
can't marry Daddy.

8
00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.306
He's my husband.

9
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.509
Well, when you're
done being married,

10
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.809
can I have him?

11
00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.912
Ha-ha. We'll never be done.

12
00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:11.381
You'll have to marry
somebody else.

13
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.217
Can I wear a white
dress and white gloves?

14
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.086
Sure, if you want to.

15
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.122
Will we live happily after ever?

16
00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:23.660
Mm-hm. If you marry somebody
who really, really loves you.

17
00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.462
Like Daddy?

18
00:01:25.486 --> 00:01:28.265
Yes, like Daddy.

19
00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.263
Terrell, man, my bad out there.

20
00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:36.600
This ain't no game. You
playing with people lives.

21
00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:38.290
Come on, man.

22
00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.872
Eric, he's got a right
to be upset with you.

23
00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.142
You left him in a dangerous
spot and tried to be a hero.

24
00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:47.977
But captain, I thought I
heard someone calling for help.

25
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.913
It was coming from
outside the building.

26
00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:52.415
It was dark, I couldn't see.

27
00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.251
That's why you stay
with your partner.

28
00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.852
He had no choice but to assume

29
00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:59.789
that something happened to
you and you needed his help.

30
00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:03.215
You never leave your
partner, especially in a fire.

31
00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:07.497
You give him some time
and then give him an apology.

32
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.166
And make it sincere.

33
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.622
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:21.311
Hey, Tasha.

35
00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:22.479
Oh, hey, Cat.

36
00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:24.347
Just saw you on
TV. Looking good.

37
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.284
Oh, I missed it. I was giving
a tour of the new cancer wing.

38
00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:28.418
Hey, has Robin left yet?

39
00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:29.419
No, she's here.

40
00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.188
Robin, Cat's here.

41
00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:32.689
Hey. How are you?

42
00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.023
I'm good. How are you?

43
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.025
Good. Hey, are we
still on for tomorrow?

44
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.895
Yeah, 4:00. You still want
those scented candles, right?

45
00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.330
Oh, absolutely. Bring 'em on.

46
00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:41.631
I wanna try them all. Good.

47
00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:43.600
Hey, I'm going to see
my parents this weekend.

48
00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:45.101
I thought they
might like some too.

49
00:03:45.125 --> 00:03:46.969
Oh, how are they?

50
00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.806
Do you know it's been a
year since Mom's stroke?

51
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.974
Well, I've been trying to
get her a new hospital bed

52
00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:55.645
and wheelchair, but their
insurance doesn't cover it.

53
00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.081
I don't know. It's so
frustrating for my dad.

54
00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.282
He wants to help her too,

55
00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.117
but, I mean, he
can't afford it either.

56
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:02.151
I am so sorry.

57
00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.353
Yeah, it's all right.

58
00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:04.688
Anyway, well, I need to run,

59
00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:06.155
but I'll see you
tomorrow, right?

60
00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.257
Right. I'll see you.

61
00:04:07.281 --> 00:04:08.991
Okay, bye. Bye.

62
00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.026
Oh.

63
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.094
Hey, Catherine.

64
00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:12.729
I'm so sorry, Dr. Keller.

65
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:14.598
Call me Gavin, please.

66
00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:17.367
Gavin, sorry for
almost running you over.

67
00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:19.102
Anytime. It's good to see you.

68
00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:20.403
You too. Take care.

69
00:04:23.797 --> 00:04:25.942
Sweet girl.

70
00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:27.344
Tasha, will you
file this for me?

71
00:04:27.368 --> 00:04:29.534
Sure, doctor.

72
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.050
If I didn't know any better,

73
00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:37.787
I'd say the doctor
has a thing for Cat.

74
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.111
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

75
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.501
Hi, sweetheart. Hey, Daddy.

76
00:04:51.525 --> 00:04:52.502
How are you?

77
00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:54.203
Oh, great. Good to see you.

78
00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:55.572
You too.

79
00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:57.140
Hey, Mama.

80
00:04:57.164 --> 00:04:59.809
How are you, huh?

81
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.711
She's doing great today.

82
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.647
Could I get you
something to drink, dear?

83
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:05.282
Uh, do you have any sweet tea?

84
00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:06.583
With lemon?

85
00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:09.452
Ha. You know me.

86
00:05:12.313 --> 00:05:15.146
Oh, Mama, I wish we could talk.

87
00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:19.596
It's been so long since
I heard your voice.

88
00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.989
I miss you.

89
00:05:51.352 --> 00:05:53.552
You have breakfast already?
- Yes.

90
00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:56.499
What'd you eat?

91
00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:59.023
I had the last
bagel and a yogurt.

92
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.978
Are you planning on
making a grocery trip soon?

93
00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:11.614
Caleb, you work 24 hours
and then you're off for 48.

94
00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:13.115
You've got more
time to go than I do.

95
00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.017
Hey, I just asked
you a simple question.

96
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.786
You don't need to
get smart with me.

97
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.388
You could save
me some breakfast.

98
00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:20.189
I never know when
you're coming or going.

99
00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.524
You don't tell me these things.

100
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.393
Catherine, what is your problem?

101
00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:25.662
Did I offend you by walking
in the door this morning?

102
00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:27.564
No. You just can't expect
me to work every day

103
00:06:27.588 --> 00:06:28.898
and still get the groceries

104
00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:31.067
while you sit home looking
at trash on the Internet

105
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:32.736
and dreaming about
getting your boat.

106
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.136
You chose to take this job.

107
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.905
And no one said you
had to work full-time.

108
00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:37.507
We need the income.

109
00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:39.809
Especially since you tuck
away a third of your salary

110
00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.644
saving for a boat we don't need.

111
00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:43.713
You've got $24,000 in savings

112
00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:46.082
while we have things in
our house that need fixing.

113
00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:47.149
Like what?

114
00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.918
The back door
needs to be painted,

115
00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:50.553
the yard needs
better landscaping.

116
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.122
And I keep telling you I wanna
put more shelves in the closet.

117
00:06:53.146 --> 00:06:55.992
Those are called preferences,
Catherine. Those are not needs.

118
00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:58.227
There's a difference. If you
wanna spend your money

119
00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.529
on that stuff, go ahead. Fine.

120
00:06:59.553 --> 00:07:01.330
But I've been saving
for my boat for years.

121
00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.699
You're not taking that from me.

122
00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:05.268
This is so pointless. I
don't have time for this.

123
00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:07.036
Yeah, shut the door
on your way out.

124
00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:32.028
<i>♪ I've been saving her
For weeks, you know ♪</i>

125
00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:33.132
<i>♪ It's time to let her go ♪</i>

126
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.062
It ain't working, Michael.

127
00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:47.310
How is it that I get
respect everywhere I go

128
00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:49.646
except in my own house?

129
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.382
I've been there, and
it's a hard place to be.

130
00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:56.953
What'd you do about it?

131
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.823
I realized that it wasn't my
marriage that was broken.

132
00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:02.367
I just didn't know
how to make it work.

133
00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:05.383
What does that mean?

134
00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.230
That treadmill's not broken,

135
00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:09.699
but if you don't
know how to run it,

136
00:08:09.723 --> 00:08:11.055
it ain't gonna work for you.

137
00:08:13.093 --> 00:08:14.904
You saying I need counseling?

138
00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:17.006
Well, I think everybody
needs counseling.

139
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.241
Hey, look, man, I
am not about to go

140
00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:21.110
talk to somebody
I don't even know

141
00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:23.546
about something that's
none of their business.

142
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.716
All right. Catherine
does need to respect you.

143
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.751
But just remember,
a woman's like a rose.

144
00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:31.654
If you treat her
right, she'll bloom.

145
00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.845
If you don't, she'll wilt.

146
00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:37.527
Where'd you get that?

147
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:39.618
Counseling.

148
00:08:58.104 --> 00:08:59.983
Great.

149
00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:02.251
What are you doing?

150
00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.554
I see you left me no pizza.

151
00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:06.990
Caleb, I just lit that candle.
I like the way it smells.

152
00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:09.291
Well, I don't. Did you
leave me any dinner at all?

153
00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:11.127
I assumed you were
eating with Michael.

154
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:13.930
Does it not occur to you
that there are two people

155
00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:16.198
living in this house, and
both of them need to eat?

156
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.668
You know what, Caleb? If you
would communicate with me,

157
00:09:18.692 --> 00:09:20.391
maybe I could have
something for you.

158
00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:24.641
Why do you have to make
everything so difficult?

159
00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.308
Oh, I'm making
everything difficult?

160
00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.511
Seems to me like I'm
carrying the weight around here

161
00:09:28.535 --> 00:09:30.179
while you're off
doing your own thing.

162
00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:32.181
Excuse me? I'm the one out there

163
00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:34.918
working to pay this mortgage,
and I pay for both of the cars.

164
00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:36.118
Yeah, and that's all you do.

165
00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:38.154
I pay all of our
bills with my salary.

166
00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:40.089
Which you agreed
to do. That's fair.

167
00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:42.258
Do you not like this house?
Do you not like your car?

168
00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:44.928
Oh, Caleb, who takes
care of this house?

169
00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:46.763
Me. Who washes all the clothes?

170
00:09:46.787 --> 00:09:48.397
Me. Who gets all the groceries?

171
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.367
Me. Not to mention I'm helping
my parents every weekend.

172
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:53.169
You know, I've got
all this pressure on me,

173
00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:55.638
and the only thing you ever
do for anybody is for yourself.

174
00:09:55.662 --> 00:09:57.406
Let me tell you
something, you don't know

175
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.241
the first thing about pressure.

176
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.879
All right? You think I-I put
out house fires for myself?

177
00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:05.915
Or...? Or rush to car
wrecks at 2 a.m. for myself?

178
00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:09.619
Or pull a child's body
out of a lake for myself?

179
00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:12.121
You have no idea
what I go through.

180
00:10:12.145 --> 00:10:14.591
Oh, yeah, but what do you do
around here other than watch TV

181
00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:16.893
and waste time on the
Internet? You know what?

182
00:10:16.917 --> 00:10:19.562
If looking at that trash is
how you get fulfilled, that's fine,

183
00:10:19.586 --> 00:10:21.464
but I will not compete with it.

184
00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:23.722
Well, I sure don't
get it from you.

185
00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:26.869
And you won't.
Because you care more

186
00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:28.905
about saving for
your stupid boat

187
00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:32.108
and pleasing yourself
than you ever did about me.

188
00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:35.377
Shut up! I'm sick of you!

189
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:38.314
You disrespectful,
ungrateful, selfish woman!

190
00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:39.315
I'm not selfish.

191
00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:40.917
How dare you say that to me?

192
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:44.721
You constantly nag me and
you drain the life out of me!

193
00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:46.823
I'm tired of it!

194
00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:48.992
If you can't give me
the respect I deserve...

195
00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:50.493
Look at me!

196
00:10:50.517 --> 00:10:53.051
Then what's the
point of this marriage?

197
00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.905
I want out.

198
00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:05.030
I just want out.

199
00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:07.576
If you want out,

200
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.646
that's fine with me!

201
00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.771
Mr. Rudolph.

202
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.140
Caleb.

203
00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:33.696
That's it.

204
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.731
All right.

205
00:12:34.755 --> 00:12:36.565
Think we got it.
We're good to go.

206
00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.034
I think I got this.

207
00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:39.702
You think you know the truck?

208
00:12:39.726 --> 00:12:41.303
Yeah. All right.

209
00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.705
I'll tell you what.

210
00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:45.474
We're gonna go inside
and get something to drink.

211
00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.676
You bring me a hose stretcher.

212
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.134
All right.

213
00:12:50.203 --> 00:12:51.547
That's mean, man.

214
00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:53.816
Nah, it's good for him.

215
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.284
Mother's gifts. Okay.

216
00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:56.318
And... You know what?

217
00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:57.353
I forgot to tell you.

218
00:12:57.377 --> 00:12:58.821
I got Friday off
and I'll be there.

219
00:12:58.845 --> 00:12:59.956
Good.

220
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.557
You know I ain't
gonna let my son down.

221
00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:02.859
I know you won't.

222
00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:04.927
Hey, we still got that
hot date tomorrow, right?

223
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.362
Oh, so now it's a hot date?

224
00:13:06.386 --> 00:13:08.798
Mm. Life's too short
to have any other kind.

225
00:13:08.822 --> 00:13:10.466
You're right.

226
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.634
I love you, baby.

227
00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:13.803
Oh, I love you too.

228
00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:15.604
And I will see
you in the morning.

229
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:16.973
All right. Back home.

230
00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:18.897
All right, see you later.

231
00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:25.469
Eric, what are you doing?

232
00:13:26.807 --> 00:13:29.185
Um, Wayne told me to
grab a hose stretcher.

233
00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:30.319
A hose stretcher?

234
00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:32.554
Yes, sir.

235
00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:35.579
Eric, you are the
hose stretcher.

236
00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:40.919
Man.

237
00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.936
Honey, I agree with
you. You gotta get out.

238
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.304
He don't deserve you.

239
00:13:48.328 --> 00:13:50.506
You can say that again. A
real man's gotta be a hero

240
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.675
to his wife before he
can be to anybody else,

241
00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:53.943
or he ain't a real man.

242
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:55.611
Catherine, do you
need a place to stay?

243
00:13:55.635 --> 00:13:57.914
I can't imagine living in the
same house with that man.

244
00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:00.316
No, I decided lat night that
I am not the one leaving.

245
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.483
He's the problem, not me.

246
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.452
That's right, girl.
Stand your ground.

247
00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:04.887
Make him respect you.

248
00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:07.290
If there's one thing
a man understands...

249
00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:09.025
It's respect. That's the issue.

250
00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:10.893
That's the reason
our marriage is failing.

251
00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:13.329
She shows me no respect at all.

252
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.031
And the saddest
part about it is...

253
00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:17.133
He doesn't have a clue.

254
00:14:17.157 --> 00:14:19.535
He thinks our marriage has
been fine for the most part.

255
00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:21.804
Mm. You know,
he probably thinks...

256
00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.873
Our marriage has
been fine until this year.

257
00:14:23.897 --> 00:14:26.675
Now, all of a sudden,
she goes off the deep end.

258
00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.045
Do you really think this
happened all of a sudden?

259
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:31.214
I don't know what to think.
I don't understand her.

260
00:14:31.238 --> 00:14:33.449
She's emotional
about everything.

261
00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:35.952
She's easily offended
and way too sensitive.

262
00:14:35.976 --> 00:14:39.288
I mean, he's so
insensitive, you know?

263
00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:41.490
He doesn't truly
care how I feel.

264
00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:43.326
He doesn't listen to me.

265
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.695
Even if I say it over
and over and over again.

266
00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.297
And then she starts
nagging me, and...

267
00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:49.966
And saying I don't
listen to her, or...

268
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.934
Or something like that.

269
00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.636
It drives me crazy. I
feel like I'm going...

270
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.339
Insane.

271
00:14:56.363 --> 00:14:59.008
You know, he doesn't
understand my needs.

272
00:14:59.032 --> 00:15:01.878
I feel like we are
completely and totally...

273
00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:03.012
Incompatible.

274
00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:04.713
She's probably
whining to her friends,

275
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.182
making me sound like a criminal.

276
00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:07.917
I can see 'em all
right now, crying,

277
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:10.019
having some sort of group hug.

278
00:15:10.043 --> 00:15:12.621
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
It's gonna be all right.

279
00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:13.856
You'll get through this.

280
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.524
We have... We have your back.

281
00:15:15.548 --> 00:15:17.659
Whatever you need.
Whatever you need.

282
00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:20.184
So you think it's past
the point of no return?

283
00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:24.200
I don't have a reason to return.

284
00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:27.370
<i>♪ I'm a son of a good man ♪</i>

285
00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:30.273
<i>♪ I'm a child of an angel ♪</i>

286
00:15:30.297 --> 00:15:31.540
Bethany.

287
00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:33.242
Hey, Kyle. Hey,
Ross. What's going on?

288
00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.676
What are y'all doing?

289
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.979
We're heading to the pizza
bar to meet some friends.

290
00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:38.881
Y'all wanna come?

291
00:15:38.905 --> 00:15:41.083
Sure.

292
00:15:41.107 --> 00:15:45.254
Hey, we'll race you there.
And if you win, we'll buy.

293
00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.057
Ready, set...

294
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:49.361
Go, go, go!

295
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.570
Hey, Dad.

296
00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:06.475
No, not really.

297
00:16:06.499 --> 00:16:09.033
I think Catherine
and I are done.

298
00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:12.670
No, it's over.

299
00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:17.475
She said she wants out.

300
00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:22.158
Um, sure, yeah, you
can come over tomorrow.

301
00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:23.592
I'll be home.

302
00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:28.464
Dad, I gotta go.

303
00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:31.033
Public Safety to
Engine 1, Battalion 1.

304
00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:33.635
Respond to the intersection
of Roosevelt and Kelley,

305
00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:35.237
10-50-I rescue.

306
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:37.239
<i>Time out, 12:21.</i> CALEB:
Hey, that's close by.

307
00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:39.942
Lieutenant, you and Terrell take
the other truck and go with us.

308
00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.078
10-4.

309
00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.353
Okay, let's roll.

310
00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:07.403
Engine 1 is en route
to Roosevelt and Kelley,

311
00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:08.937
10-50 rescue.

312
00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:10.339
<i>10-4, Engine 1.</i>

313
00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:12.708
Lieutenant, you and Sanders
have the Hurst tools ready

314
00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:14.410
if we need them.

315
00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:15.777
You stay with me
when we pull up.

316
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:17.513
Yes, sir.

317
00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:20.449
We've already got a crowd.

318
00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:22.451
Can you see it?

319
00:17:22.475 --> 00:17:24.887
We've got one car on the tracks.
- You're kidding.

320
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:26.522
Oh, it doesn't look good.

321
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:27.956
Engine 1, it's 10-23.

322
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.959
We have a two-vehicle accident
with possible entrapment.

323
00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:32.828
One of the vehicles
is on the train tracks.

324
00:17:32.852 --> 00:17:36.899
Notify the train dispatcher
to stop all trains in progress.

325
00:17:36.923 --> 00:17:39.568
<i>10-4, Command. Be
advised, EMS is en route.</i>

326
00:17:39.592 --> 00:17:40.702
Rookie, you come with me.

327
00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.293
Yes, sir. WAYNE: Let's go.

328
00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:45.374
Sanders, you two
go check out the car.

329
00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:49.378
Let me know what you got. I
need an inch-and-three-quarter line.

330
00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.013
Harmon, you check
out the passenger.

331
00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:53.182
All right, I need you all
to stay clear of the tracks

332
00:17:53.206 --> 00:17:54.883
and the vehicle.

333
00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:57.053
I'm Captain Holt from the
Albany Fire Department.

334
00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.754
We're here to help.
Help me, please.

335
00:17:58.778 --> 00:18:00.756
I can't get out. CALEB:
Where are you hurting?

336
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.192
My... My legs are hurting.
Please... Please help me.

337
00:18:03.216 --> 00:18:05.928
All right, we're gonna help you.

338
00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:07.430
Okay.

339
00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:08.664
Where else are you hurting?

340
00:18:08.688 --> 00:18:11.333
My... My neck is hurting.
Please, please help.

341
00:18:11.357 --> 00:18:13.802
We're gonna get you out of
here. You're gonna be just fine.

342
00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:16.572
Please don't leave me.
Please don't let me die.

343
00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.507
I promise you I am
not going to leave you.

344
00:18:18.531 --> 00:18:20.376
You're gonna be all right.
- Captain.

345
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.777
She's alive but not responding.

346
00:18:21.801 --> 00:18:23.245
Get the spreaders. Yes, sir.

347
00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.847
Captain, those two will be
okay. They've got minor injuries.

348
00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:28.350
We have to cut these two
out. Sanders, help Harmon.

349
00:18:28.374 --> 00:18:30.619
Check for gas leaks. Yes, sir.

350
00:18:30.643 --> 00:18:32.288
Ma'am, we've got an
ambulance coming.

351
00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:33.889
I'm gonna stay
here with you. Okay.

352
00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:35.691
In a moment, you'll
hear a very loud noise.

353
00:18:35.715 --> 00:18:37.659
That just means we're
getting you out faster.

354
00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:39.462
Okay. All right.

355
00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:41.464
You're gonna be all right. Okay.

356
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.667
Captain, did I
just hear a train?

357
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:47.236
Guys, there's a train coming!

358
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.105
Dispatcher, this is
Roosevelt Command.

359
00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.872
We have a car
on the train tracks.

360
00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:53.942
Notify the train dispatcher
to stop all trains in progress.

361
00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.911
<i>Roosevelt Command, be advised</i>

362
00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:57.613
<i>we are currently
unable to make contact</i>

363
00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.348
<i>with the train dispatcher.</i>

364
00:18:59.372 --> 00:19:01.217
No, no, no. We don't
have time. Come on,

365
00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.785
we're gonna have to push it
out of the way. Let's go, let's go!

366
00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:07.256
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

367
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.259
All right, let's go. Push. Push.

368
00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.332
It's not rolling. We
gotta drag it off.

369
00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:17.899
All right. Get the chain.

370
00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:20.569
Hey, Wayne, hook up the
chain. Hook up the chain.

371
00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:25.141
Hey, there's a train!

372
00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.509
Captain, we gotta pick this up.

373
00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:28.577
All right, grab the front.

374
00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:31.614
Lift on three. One, two, three.

375
00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:37.819
Again. One, two, three.

376
00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:43.859
Again. Let's go. We're
getting this car off the tracks.

377
00:19:43.883 --> 00:19:46.195
One, two, three.

378
00:19:47.987 --> 00:19:48.997
Ow, my legs. Ow.

379
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:53.435
Again. One, two, three.

380
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.405
Again, captain.

381
00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:58.307
Get me out! CALEB:
One, two, three.

382
00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.878
One, two, three.

383
00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:21.564
Harmon, go back
and get the spreaders.

384
00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:25.824
Medic!

385
00:20:26.759 --> 00:20:28.070
You all right?

386
00:20:28.094 --> 00:20:29.572
Come on, let's go.

387
00:20:29.596 --> 00:20:31.640
You'll be okay. You're
gonna be all right.

388
00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:32.908
Is she okay?

389
00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:13.103
Thank you, Lord.

390
00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.553
Thank you, God.

391
00:21:19.145 --> 00:21:21.457
Thank you, God.

392
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:22.613
Oh.

393
00:21:24.584 --> 00:21:26.128
Are you okay?

394
00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:29.768
Captain, I just needed a minute.

395
00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:41.877
Well, I broke my
record of how close

396
00:21:41.901 --> 00:21:43.779
I could come to
death and still live.

397
00:21:46.172 --> 00:21:48.506
Well, don't break it next time.

398
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.710
I wasn't trying to
break it this time.

399
00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.515
Hey.

400
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.017
Don't tell my wife.

401
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:31.126
Hey, lieutenant?

402
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.729
Yeah?

403
00:22:33.753 --> 00:22:36.365
This kind of thing doesn't
happen all the time, does it?

404
00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:37.399
Risking our lives?

405
00:22:37.423 --> 00:22:38.801
Yes.

406
00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:40.101
Playing chicken with a train?

407
00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:42.025
First time.

408
00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:44.940
Aren't you afraid of dying?

409
00:22:44.964 --> 00:22:47.509
No. 'Cause I know
where I'm going.

410
00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:50.401
I just don't wanna get there
'cause I got hit by a train.

411
00:22:53.272 --> 00:22:56.352
Why don't you come help
me work on some dinner?

412
00:22:56.376 --> 00:22:57.775
All right.

413
00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:03.525
Hey, captain, hold
on for a second.

414
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:06.094
You know where you're going?

415
00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:07.295
I'm going to my office.

416
00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:09.598
No.

417
00:23:09.622 --> 00:23:12.200
You believe in heaven and hell?

418
00:23:14.427 --> 00:23:15.537
I don't know.

419
00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:17.873
When I die, I'm
going in the ground.

420
00:23:17.897 --> 00:23:19.742
That's where I'm staying.

421
00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:21.610
You know, you and
Michael both seem so sure,

422
00:23:21.634 --> 00:23:22.745
but one of you is wrong.

423
00:23:22.769 --> 00:23:25.249
It ain't me.

424
00:23:25.705 --> 00:23:28.216
How do you know?

425
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.586
Hey, listen, you might
not agree with Michael,

426
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.176
but you and I both
know he's the real deal.

427
00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:40.696
<i>Son, how long has
this been going on?</i>

428
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.532
I don't know, Dad. We've had
our arguments now and then,

429
00:23:43.556 --> 00:23:46.735
but it seems like now she is
constantly frustrated with me.

430
00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:49.605
I mean, I walk in the door and
she's mad about something.

431
00:23:49.629 --> 00:23:51.507
Have you given her
reason to be upset?

432
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:53.776
I've never known Catherine
to be unreasonable.

433
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.578
I could have saved the
lives of two people at work,

434
00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:58.781
and if I'm not here
helping wash the dishes,

435
00:23:58.805 --> 00:24:00.015
I'm a horrible husband.

436
00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:02.317
But, Caleb, she needs
your help here as well.

437
00:24:02.341 --> 00:24:04.686
Doesn't she help her
parents out every week?

438
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.288
She can't do
everything around here.

439
00:24:06.312 --> 00:24:07.956
You sound like
you're taking her side.

440
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.426
Caleb, she's working
every day, and she's trying...

441
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.927
Mom, I do not
need you to tell me

442
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:13.228
I'm doing everything wrong.

443
00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:14.563
I've got Catherine for that.

444
00:24:14.587 --> 00:24:17.499
I am not the problem,
she is. All I'm saying is,

445
00:24:17.523 --> 00:24:19.768
if she's working... Cheryl,
let's hear Caleb out.

446
00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:22.471
I wanna know what's
going on with him.

447
00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:28.043
Dad, can I please have a few
minutes to talk with you, alone?

448
00:24:28.067 --> 00:24:30.646
Caleb, I just wanna
help you and Catherine.

449
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:31.747
Dad.

450
00:24:31.771 --> 00:24:32.771
Honey.

451
00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:35.116
Why don't you
let us take a walk?

452
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.819
It's all right.

453
00:24:36.843 --> 00:24:38.241
Okay.

454
00:24:42.849 --> 00:24:46.261
Dad, why did you
have to bring her?

455
00:24:46.285 --> 00:24:50.632
Caleb, because she's
my wife, and your mother.

456
00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:52.935
No one loves you more than her.

457
00:24:52.959 --> 00:24:55.537
She just... She's
always fixing me.

458
00:24:55.561 --> 00:24:57.339
She's still trying to fix me.

459
00:24:57.363 --> 00:24:58.807
I'm not broken.

460
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:03.745
Son, if you're looking
for a perfect mother,

461
00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:05.914
I'm afraid there's
not one out there.

462
00:25:05.938 --> 00:25:07.649
But she's a good woman.

463
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:09.818
And I love her now
more than I ever have.

464
00:25:09.842 --> 00:25:12.554
I'm not saying I don't love
her, Dad. I... Just that she...

465
00:25:12.578 --> 00:25:14.857
She... She grates on me.

466
00:25:14.881 --> 00:25:19.194
Have you not seen a change
in her in the last two years?

467
00:25:19.218 --> 00:25:21.897
Y-Yeah, she... She
treats you better.

468
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:25.467
But you've also put up
with a lot over the years.

469
00:25:25.491 --> 00:25:28.069
Well, so has she.

470
00:25:28.093 --> 00:25:29.905
Dad, I'm glad
you didn't split up,

471
00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:32.474
but I would have
understood if you had.

472
00:25:32.498 --> 00:25:34.498
Do you know why we didn't?

473
00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:37.479
Not really.

474
00:25:37.503 --> 00:25:39.247
She realized she
couldn't do any better?

475
00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:40.916
Not quite.

476
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.452
Caleb, the Lord
did a work in us.

477
00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:46.510
In both of us.

478
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.457
The Lord?

479
00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:51.693
Uh, you're giving credit to God?

480
00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:53.294
Why does that bother you?

481
00:25:53.318 --> 00:25:56.464
You've always believed in God.

482
00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:58.266
If there's a God out
there somewhere, Dad,

483
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.468
he's not interested in
me and my problems.

484
00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:01.703
I disagree.

485
00:26:01.727 --> 00:26:04.339
I'd say he's very interested.

486
00:26:04.363 --> 00:26:05.974
Then where's he been in my life?

487
00:26:05.998 --> 00:26:07.676
I'd say he's been at
work all around you.

488
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.110
You just haven't realized it.

489
00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:12.636
You haven't exactly given
him an open invitation.

490
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.342
What is this place?

491
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.724
Used to be a summer
camp across the lake.

492
00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:25.215
I think this must
be a part of it.

493
00:26:26.953 --> 00:26:31.488
Son, I used to be
where you are right now.

494
00:26:32.558 --> 00:26:34.736
God didn't matter to me.

495
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.939
But I can't say that anymore.

496
00:26:36.963 --> 00:26:39.207
I never understood why
Jesus had to die on the cross...

497
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:41.176
D-Dad... Dad, please. Uh...

498
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.545
We had this
conversation last month.

499
00:26:43.569 --> 00:26:45.948
I'm glad this new faith is
working for you and Mom,

500
00:26:45.972 --> 00:26:47.382
I really am.

501
00:26:47.406 --> 00:26:49.250
It's just...

502
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.241
It's not for me.

503
00:26:56.983 --> 00:26:59.360
Caleb,

504
00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:03.498
is there anything in you that
wants to save your marriage?

505
00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:05.634
Maybe. If Catherine
wanted to, but she doesn't.

506
00:27:05.658 --> 00:27:06.735
She wants divorce.

507
00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:08.436
Is that what you want?

508
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.973
I want peace.

509
00:27:10.997 --> 00:27:12.474
But what difference
does it make?

510
00:27:12.498 --> 00:27:14.364
She signs the papers,
Dad, it's all over.

511
00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:19.409
Have you agreed to
start the process with her?

512
00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:21.850
No, but I think we
both understand

513
00:27:21.874 --> 00:27:23.151
where this is all headed.

514
00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:25.220
I've got plans to meet
with my lawyer tomorrow.

515
00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:27.623
Caleb, I want you to
do something for me.

516
00:27:27.647 --> 00:27:29.625
What?

517
00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:32.850
I want you to hold off on
the divorce for 40 days.

518
00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:35.631
Why?

519
00:27:35.655 --> 00:27:39.534
I'm gonna send you
something in the mail,

520
00:27:39.558 --> 00:27:41.918
something that'll take
you that long to do.

521
00:27:42.962 --> 00:27:44.272
What is it?

522
00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:48.110
It's what saved our marriage.

523
00:27:48.134 --> 00:27:51.479
Dad, if this is a religious
thing, I'd rather you didn't.

524
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:54.683
Look at it as a gift
from your father.

525
00:27:54.707 --> 00:27:57.841
Take one day at a time,
then see what happens.

526
00:27:58.978 --> 00:28:00.321
Please, son.

527
00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:04.425
If for no other
reason, do it for me.

528
00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:06.583
I'm asking as your father.

529
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.867
Forty days?

530
00:28:11.891 --> 00:28:13.824
Forty days.

531
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.817
Eating alone?

532
00:28:28.841 --> 00:28:30.819
Well, hello, Dr. Keller.

533
00:28:30.843 --> 00:28:32.487
Gavin. Gavin, sorry.

534
00:28:32.511 --> 00:28:34.056
How are you? I'm doing well.

535
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.224
I just, uh, need a place
to put my plate down.

536
00:28:36.248 --> 00:28:37.458
Is this spot reserved?

537
00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:39.027
Oh, um, well,
Deidra was supposed

538
00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:40.862
to meet me, but you're
welcome to join us.

539
00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:43.431
Well, if you're gonna twist my
arm, I don't want any trouble.

540
00:28:48.761 --> 00:28:50.806
Are you gonna eat wearing
your clean white coat?

541
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.474
Well, I do need to keep
up with the latest fashions.

542
00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:56.211
It seems all the doctors
are wearing one these days.

543
00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:59.147
But it's probably not too
smart while I'm eating.

544
00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:01.216
I didn't know doctors
cared about fashion.

545
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.551
Well, we have to keep up
with the attractive fashions

546
00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:05.954
the Public Relations
employees wear.

547
00:29:05.978 --> 00:29:07.589
I see.

548
00:29:07.613 --> 00:29:10.025
Well, since there's only
one person in that category,

549
00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:11.426
I'm sure she'd feel honored.

550
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.427
She should.

551
00:29:12.451 --> 00:29:14.118
She's pretty amazing.

552
00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:31.635
Hey, you look good.

553
00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:35.583
Thanks.

554
00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:38.186
I try to take care of myself.

555
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.310
You like this song?

556
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.413
Oh, yeah.

557
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.129
You feel that?

558
00:29:47.153 --> 00:29:51.121
It's called chemistry,
and we got it.

559
00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:55.137
Wayne won't leave you.

560

<i>♪ I'm tired of you twisting

561
00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.278

562
00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:05.346
No, I ain't seen it.

563
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.610

Whoo! That ain't funny.

573
00:30:27.927 --> 00:30:30.105
This ain't no show.

574
00:30:30.129 --> 00:30:31.572
This is me time.

575
00:30:32.998 --> 00:30:34.309
Terrell!

576
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.610
Wayne.

577
00:30:39.805 --> 00:30:40.949
Forty days?

578
00:30:40.973 --> 00:30:43.351
Does Catherine know?

579
00:30:43.375 --> 00:30:44.752
I'm not gonna tell her.

580
00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:48.023
If she wants to go ahead
and file, that's up to her.

581
00:30:48.047 --> 00:30:50.792
Divorce is a hard thing, man.

582
00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:52.527
Well, if it brings peace...

583
00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:55.931
But Caleb, you want
the right kind of peace.

584
00:30:55.955 --> 00:30:57.187
What do you mean by that?

585
00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.668
You know what that ring
on your finger means?

586
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.470
Means I'm married. Yeah.

587
00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:04.672
Well, it also means you
made a lifelong covenant,

588
00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:07.575
you putting on that ring
while saying your vows.

589
00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.677
The sad part about it is,
when most people promise

590
00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.846
for better or for worse,

591
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.310
they really only
mean for the better.

592
00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:16.952
Catherine and I were in love

593
00:31:16.976 --> 00:31:18.887
when we got married,
but today, ahem,

594
00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:21.156
we're two very different
people, all right?

595
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.724
It's just not working
out anymore.

596
00:31:26.986 --> 00:31:30.354
Caleb, salt and pepper
are completely different.

597
00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:34.802
Their makeup is different,
their taste and their color.

598
00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.905
But you always see 'em together.

599
00:31:36.929 --> 00:31:39.975
And when you...

600
00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:41.331
Hold on just a second.

601
00:31:49.108 --> 00:31:50.385
What are you doing?

602
00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:54.322
Michael.

603
00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:56.091
Hey.

604
00:31:56.115 --> 00:31:58.181
What'd you do that for?

605
00:32:04.056 --> 00:32:06.701
Caleb, when two
people get married,

606
00:32:06.725 --> 00:32:08.836
it's for better or for worse.

607
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.906
For richer or for poorer.

608
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.075
In sickness and in health.

609
00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:15.076
I know that.

610
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.511
But marriages aren't fireproof.

611
00:32:16.535 --> 00:32:18.201
Sometimes, you get burned.

612
00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:23.118
Fireproof doesn't mean
that a fire will never come,

613
00:32:23.142 --> 00:32:25.420
but that when it comes,
you'll be able to withstand it.

614
00:32:26.812 --> 00:32:28.390
You didn't have to
glue 'em together.

615
00:32:28.414 --> 00:32:31.026
Don't do it, Caleb. If
you pull 'em apart now,

616
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.450
you'll break either
one or both of 'em.

617
00:32:35.955 --> 00:32:38.699
I am not a perfect person,
but better than most.

618
00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:41.702
And if my marriage is
failing, it is not all my fault.

619
00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:44.172
But, Caleb, man, I've seen
you run into a burning building

620
00:32:44.196 --> 00:32:46.141
to save people you
don't even know,

621
00:32:46.165 --> 00:32:47.809
but you're gonna let
your own marriage

622
00:32:47.833 --> 00:32:49.166
just burn to the ground.

623
00:32:52.271 --> 00:32:54.482
Michael, you are my friend.

624
00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:57.518
And I have allowed you to
speak freely with me on this job.

625
00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:58.842
Don't abuse it.

626
00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:47.668
<i>My son, this 40-day journey
cannot be taken lightly.</i>

627
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:50.771
<i>It is a challenging and
often difficult process</i>

628
00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:53.041
<i>but an incredibly
fulfilling one.</i>

629
00:33:53.065 --> 00:33:56.144
<i>If you will commit to a
day at a time for 40 days,</i>

630
00:33:56.168 --> 00:33:59.780
<i>the results could change
your life and your marriage.</i>

631
00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:04.041
<i>Consider it a dare from others
who have done it before you.</i>

632
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.321
<i>Day one:</i>

633
00:34:06.345 --> 00:34:08.623
<i>The first part of this
dare is fairly simple.</i>

634
00:34:08.647 --> 00:34:11.292
<i>Although love is communicated
in a number of ways,</i>

635
00:34:11.316 --> 00:34:14.562
<i>our words often reflect
the condition of our heart.</i>

636
00:34:14.586 --> 00:34:16.064
<i>For the next day, resolve to say</i>

637
00:34:16.088 --> 00:34:18.799
<i>nothing negative
to your spouse at all.</i>

638
00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:21.702
<i>If the temptation arises,
choose not to say anything.</i>

639
00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.071
<i>It's better to hold your tongue</i>

640
00:34:23.095 --> 00:34:25.273
<i>than to say
something you'll regret.</i>

641
00:34:25.297 --> 00:34:29.344
<i>Be quick to listen, slow to
speak and slow to get angry.</i>

642
00:34:29.368 --> 00:34:33.181
<i>James 1:19.</i>

643
00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:49.264
Would you have time to take
that to the dry-cleaners today?

644
00:34:49.288 --> 00:34:50.432
Think after two days off,

645
00:34:50.456 --> 00:34:52.522
you would have already
taken care of that.

646
00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:08.283
<i>Day two:</i>

647
00:35:08.307 --> 00:35:10.385
<i>It is difficult to
demonstrate love</i>

648
00:35:10.409 --> 00:35:12.687
<i>when you feel little
to no motivation.</i>

649
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:16.191
<i>But love in its truest sense
is not based on feelings,</i>

650
00:35:16.215 --> 00:35:19.026
<i>but a determination to
show thoughtful actions</i>

651
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.529
<i>even when there
seems to be no reward.</i>

652
00:35:21.553 --> 00:35:24.566
<i>In addition to saying nothing
negative to your spouse today,</i>

653
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.768
<i>do at least one
unexpected gesture</i>

654
00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:30.227
<i>as an act of kindness.</i>

655
00:35:55.053 --> 00:35:57.365
I poured your coffee.

656
00:35:57.389 --> 00:35:59.501
I don't have time for coffee.

657
00:36:21.647 --> 00:36:23.324
<i>Day three:</i>

658
00:36:23.348 --> 00:36:27.228
<i>Whatever you put your
time, energy and money into</i>

659
00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:28.996
<i>will become more
important to you.</i>

660
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.365
<i>It's hard to care for something</i>

661
00:36:30.389 --> 00:36:32.233
<i>you're not investing in.</i>

662
00:36:32.257 --> 00:36:35.370
<i>Along with refraining from
any negative comments,</i>

663
00:36:35.394 --> 00:36:36.837
<i>buy your wife
something that says</i>

664
00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:40.375
<i>you were thinking of her today.</i>

665
00:36:40.399 --> 00:36:42.644
Yeah, I need to order
some flowers or something

666
00:36:42.668 --> 00:36:43.978
for my wife.

667
00:36:44.002 --> 00:36:46.914
No. No, it doesn't matter.

668
00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:49.517
Sure. How much does that cost?

669
00:36:49.541 --> 00:36:51.553
Forty-five?

670
00:36:51.577 --> 00:36:54.189
Do you have something cheaper?

671
00:36:54.213 --> 00:36:56.057
Yeah, yeah, that...
That's more like it.

672
00:36:56.081 --> 00:36:57.958
Let's go with the 25.

673
00:36:57.982 --> 00:36:59.093
How about, um...?

674
00:36:59.117 --> 00:37:01.062
How about a box of
chocolates or something?

675
00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:02.497
How much is that?

676
00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:03.698
Oh.

677
00:37:03.722 --> 00:37:06.267
You're killing me.

678
00:37:06.291 --> 00:37:08.102
That's better.

679
00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:10.871
Okay, how about...? How
about a little stuffed bear?

680
00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.940
All right, forget the bear.

681
00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:14.442
Okay, how long
is it gonna take you

682
00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:16.466
to throw something
like that together?

683
00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:36.297
Man, you done lost your mind.

684
00:37:36.321 --> 00:37:39.234
Terrell, I can
bench 300 right now.

685
00:37:39.258 --> 00:37:40.668
For real?

686
00:37:40.692 --> 00:37:42.937
Why can't we all come to
the same obvious conclusion?

687
00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:44.872
That I am the man.

688
00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:48.309
All I know is the man left
the thermal-imaging device

689
00:37:48.333 --> 00:37:49.544
on the bumper of the truck

690
00:37:49.568 --> 00:37:50.878
last night. Mm-hm.

691
00:37:50.902 --> 00:37:52.747
That's an $8000 piece
of equipment, Wayne.

692
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:55.216
All right. My bad, captain.
But that still doesn't change

693
00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.285
the fact when it comes
to difficult situations,

694
00:37:57.309 --> 00:37:59.721
I can take it. Man, I
can't take this much ego.

695
00:37:59.745 --> 00:38:02.357
Wayne, you've been bragging
on yourself for 10 minutes, man.

696
00:38:02.381 --> 00:38:04.492
It ain't bragging if it's true.

697
00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:07.161
Last week at the apartment
fire, I pulled off two attack lines,

698
00:38:07.185 --> 00:38:09.029
laid my own supply
line and caught a hydrant

699
00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:10.265
in under two minutes.

700
00:38:10.289 --> 00:38:12.367
So? There's other folks
that could do that, man.

701
00:38:12.391 --> 00:38:13.701
Not from this station.

702
00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:14.769
Tom McBride could.

703
00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:16.704
At Station 4? Are you kidding?

704
00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:19.106
He might do it in two and a
half but he can't do it under two.

705
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.875
I don't know. Captain,

706
00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:23.378
he's strong, but
he's not as fast.

707
00:38:23.402 --> 00:38:25.882
I could take him
any day of the week.

708
00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:28.716
Wayne, you seem
pretty high on yourself.

709
00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.585
I think confidence
is a good thing,

710
00:38:30.609 --> 00:38:32.754
but you're over the top.

711
00:38:32.778 --> 00:38:34.322
Man, he way over the top.

712
00:38:34.346 --> 00:38:36.786
I can back it up.
That's all I'm saying.

713
00:38:37.215 --> 00:38:38.459
Wrath of God, baby.

714
00:38:38.483 --> 00:38:40.094
What's that for?

715
00:38:40.118 --> 00:38:41.763
We're about to
have a little contest.

716
00:38:41.787 --> 00:38:44.532
We're just gonna see if
Wayne really is the man.

717
00:38:44.556 --> 00:38:46.033
That is, if he's
for the challenge.

718
00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:48.891
Oh, I'm all about this.

719
00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:51.295
All right.

720
00:38:52.464 --> 00:38:53.641
I'll go first.

721
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:55.176
What are...? What
are you gonna do?

722
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.779
Michael, time me.
You got it. Ready?

723
00:38:57.803 --> 00:38:59.043
Go.

724
00:39:02.207 --> 00:39:04.452
No way.

725
00:39:04.476 --> 00:39:06.788
Man, you crazy.

726
00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:09.212
He gonna drink the whole thing.

727
00:39:21.727 --> 00:39:23.504
Twenty-three seconds.

728
00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.574
Whoo-hoo.

729
00:39:26.598 --> 00:39:28.676
All right, man. You're up.

730
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.711
All right.

731
00:39:29.735 --> 00:39:31.546
That was impressive.

732
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.382
Till I do it under 20.

733
00:39:34.406 --> 00:39:35.383
Time me.

734
00:39:35.407 --> 00:39:36.718
Oh, I'll time you.

735
00:39:36.742 --> 00:39:38.753
Ready? Ladies.

736
00:39:38.777 --> 00:39:40.888
Go.

737
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:45.960
Oh, it's hot. ERIC:
Come on, Wayne.

738
00:39:45.984 --> 00:39:46.961
Go, Wayne.

739
00:39:46.985 --> 00:39:48.262
Ten seconds, Wayne.

740
00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:50.164
I though you could take it.

741
00:39:51.757 --> 00:39:52.900
You gotta drink that, bro.

742
00:39:52.924 --> 00:39:54.290
Fourteen seconds, Wayne.

743
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.304
Come on. Aah!

744
00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:59.206
It burns!

745
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.509
Where the man at now, huh?

746
00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:03.944
I thought he said
he could take it.

747
00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.012
Aah!

748
00:40:05.036 --> 00:40:07.003
My mouth's on fire!

749
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.117
Captain, how'd you do that, man?

750
00:40:11.676 --> 00:40:13.354
You could do it too, Terrell,

751
00:40:13.378 --> 00:40:15.189
if you replaced yours
with tomato juice.

752
00:40:18.383 --> 00:40:20.395
So funny. That is classic.

753
00:40:20.419 --> 00:40:22.285
That was awesome.

754
00:40:24.055 --> 00:40:25.600
Dr. Anderson?

755
00:40:25.624 --> 00:40:26.901
Hi, I just wanted to remind you

756
00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:28.469
about your interview
in 10 minutes.

757
00:40:28.493 --> 00:40:30.538
Catherine, thank you.
I'll certainly be there.

758
00:40:30.562 --> 00:40:33.107
Sure, and congratulations on
your cancer-research award.

759
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:34.675
You deserve it.
I appreciate that.

760
00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:37.512
This is Catherine.

761
00:40:37.536 --> 00:40:39.514
Hey, it's Caleb.

762
00:40:39.538 --> 00:40:41.181
I wanted to call
and check on you.

763
00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:44.018
You wanted to check on me?

764
00:40:44.042 --> 00:40:45.185
What for?

765
00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:48.611
Uh, you know, just see
if you needed anything.

766
00:40:50.148 --> 00:40:52.293
You called to see if
I needed anything?

767
00:40:52.317 --> 00:40:53.795
<i>Right, yeah.</i>

768
00:40:53.819 --> 00:40:56.063
<i>Uh, you want me to bring
something home for you, or...?</i>

769
00:40:56.087 --> 00:40:58.933
<i>Or get something from
the store in the morning?</i>

770
00:40:58.957 --> 00:41:01.769
Caleb, you never asked me
this before. What's going on?

771
00:41:01.793 --> 00:41:05.740
I just wanted to see if you
needed anything, that's it.

772
00:41:05.764 --> 00:41:08.075
<i>I'm fine.</i>

773
00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:10.277
Okay.

774
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.480
All right, well...

775
00:41:12.504 --> 00:41:14.070
goodbye.

776
00:41:19.978 --> 00:41:22.311
Day four, ahem, done.

777
00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:30.197
Hey, Cat, how you doing, girl?

778
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:32.166
Confused.

779
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.168
Uh, my husband's acting weird.

780
00:41:34.192 --> 00:41:35.636
What's he doing?

781
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.071
Well...

782
00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:39.674
in the last few days,

783
00:41:39.698 --> 00:41:42.209
he has fixed me coffee,

784
00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:45.045
bought me these
pitiful little flowers

785
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:48.483
and just now, called just
to see if I'm doing okay.

786
00:41:48.507 --> 00:41:49.650
Really?

787
00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:50.952
Yeah.

788
00:41:50.976 --> 00:41:52.520
I'll tell you what he's doing.

789
00:41:52.544 --> 00:41:54.421
He's trying to butter
you up for a divorce.

790
00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:56.491
And why would he do that?

791
00:41:56.515 --> 00:41:58.192
Before my cousin
Luwanna got a divorce,

792
00:41:58.216 --> 00:41:59.794
her husband did the same thing.

793
00:41:59.818 --> 00:42:01.428
He started acting
all nice and sweet,

794
00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:02.997
and then the next thing we know,

795
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.199
he walks away with the
house and most of their money.

796
00:42:05.223 --> 00:42:07.001
He hasn't even
talked to her since.

797
00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:09.504
Don't you let him
deceive you, girl.

798
00:42:09.528 --> 00:42:10.693
Mm.

799
00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:39.567
Did you clear your history?

800
00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:41.168
What?

801
00:42:41.192 --> 00:42:42.469
Did you wipe the websites off

802
00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:45.028
so nobody would see
where you've been?

803
00:42:50.602 --> 00:42:52.813
You know, Caleb, you're
not fooling anybody.

804
00:42:52.837 --> 00:42:54.515
I know exactly what
you're trying to do,

805
00:42:54.539 --> 00:42:58.252
buying me flowers
and calling me at work.

806
00:42:58.276 --> 00:42:59.720
And what is that?

807
00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:01.288
I'm meeting with a
lawyer next week,

808
00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:02.757
and don't you
think for one second

809
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:05.526
I'm buying into this
nice-guy routine.

810
00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.896
What are you talking about?

811
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.198
You're not getting one
dime more than you deserve.

812
00:43:11.222 --> 00:43:14.201
When this divorce is
final, I'm taking my share.

813
00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:15.937
Is that what you
think I'm doing?

814
00:43:15.961 --> 00:43:17.939
No, I know that's
what you're doing.

815
00:43:17.963 --> 00:43:19.239
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

816
00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:20.875
You never assume
I would do anything

817
00:43:20.899 --> 00:43:22.977
worthy of respect.
Anything honorable.

818
00:43:23.001 --> 00:43:24.244
Honorable?

819
00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.747
Honorable? What were
you just looking at, Caleb?

820
00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:28.248
What was on that
computer screen?

821
00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.250
Was that honorable?

822
00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:31.619
Who do you think you're fooling?

823
00:43:31.643 --> 00:43:33.420
Do you know why your
sweet little gestures

824
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:34.922
mean nothing to me?

825
00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:37.224
It's because that's the
kind of man you've become.

826
00:43:37.248 --> 00:43:39.460
When you're alone,
that's what you default to,

827
00:43:39.484 --> 00:43:42.196
and there is nothing
honorable about it.

828
00:44:09.614 --> 00:44:10.654
Mr. Rudolph.

829
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.983
Caleb.

830
00:44:30.368 --> 00:44:31.345
Hello?

831
00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:32.880
It's not working, Dad.

832
00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:34.115
<i>What's not working?</i>

833
00:44:34.139 --> 00:44:36.651
This whole love dare
thing. It is not working.

834
00:44:36.675 --> 00:44:38.953
Tell me what's going on.

835
00:44:38.977 --> 00:44:41.522
I have been doing
everything that it says to do,

836
00:44:41.546 --> 00:44:44.458
and she has completely
rejected all of it.

837
00:44:44.482 --> 00:44:46.426
Caleb, this process
takes 40 days, not four.

838
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.729
<i>What's the point of going
down a dead-end road</i>

839
00:44:48.753 --> 00:44:50.397
<i>when you know it's
not going anywhere?</i>

840
00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:52.166
You don't know that yet.

841
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.035
<i>Caleb, you're not a quitter.</i>

842
00:44:54.059 --> 00:44:59.040
And something tells me you're
doing just enough to get by.

843
00:44:59.064 --> 00:45:00.596
Am I right?

844
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.848
I feel nothing.

845
00:45:07.872 --> 00:45:09.516
I understand, son.

846
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.153
<i>But this is not
based on feelings.</i>

847
00:45:12.177 --> 00:45:13.620
<i>It's a decision.</i>

848
00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:15.923
You can't give up yet.

849
00:45:15.947 --> 00:45:18.147
Keep taking a day at a time.

850
00:45:20.318 --> 00:45:21.295
Tsk.

851
00:45:21.319 --> 00:45:22.418
Yes, sir.

852
00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:24.987
I love you, son.

853
00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:27.656
You too, Dad.

854
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.713
How is he?

855
00:45:38.737 --> 00:45:41.437
We've gotta start
praying for him more.

856
00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:47.176
Mama, I don't know what to do.

857
00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:50.024
I know you always
told me to hang on

858
00:45:50.048 --> 00:45:52.882
during the hard times, but...

859
00:45:56.221 --> 00:46:00.300
You don't know what
I've been competing with.

860
00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:02.191
I mean, when he look...

861
00:46:08.266 --> 00:46:12.246
He makes me feel so humiliated.

862
00:46:13.271 --> 00:46:15.805
And he doesn't even know it.

863
00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:23.545
When did I stop being
good enough for him?

00:47:20.538 --> 00:47:24.040
<i>♪ It's a slow fade ♪</i>

874
00:47:27.145 --> 00:47:31.214
<i>♪ It's a slow fade ♪</i>

875
00:47:35.854 --> 00:47:37.019
So, what day are you on?

876
00:47:39.157 --> 00:47:41.123
Eighteen. And?

877
00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.205
And it's still difficult.

878
00:47:44.229 --> 00:47:48.008
Every day has me adding a
new concept to the way I treat her.

879
00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:49.710
For example?

880
00:47:49.734 --> 00:47:52.479
Well, here.

881
00:47:52.503 --> 00:47:54.614
Day 16 was about
praying for her.

882
00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:55.816
I kind of skipped that one.

883
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.720
Day 17 is about
listening to her.

884
00:47:59.744 --> 00:48:02.156
Eighteen's about
studying her again.

885
00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.358
Studying her? Yeah.

886
00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:06.460
Here.

887
00:48:06.484 --> 00:48:08.462
"When a man is trying to
win the heart of a woman,

888
00:48:08.486 --> 00:48:09.796
"he studies her.

889
00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.532
"He learns her likes,
dislikes, habits and hobbies.

890
00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:14.935
"But after he wins her
heart and marries her,

891
00:48:14.959 --> 00:48:16.636
"he often stops
learning about her.

892
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.073
"If the amount he studied
her before marriage

893
00:48:19.097 --> 00:48:21.141
"was equal to a
high school degree,

894
00:48:21.165 --> 00:48:23.010
"he should continue
to learn about her

895
00:48:23.034 --> 00:48:26.213
"until he gains a college
degree, a master's degree

896
00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:28.415
"and ultimately, a
doctorate degree.

897
00:48:28.439 --> 00:48:30.617
"It is a lifelong journey
that draws his heart

898
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:33.687
ever closer to hers."
That's a pretty good concept.

899
00:48:33.711 --> 00:48:35.511
I never thought
about it like that.

900
00:48:37.916 --> 00:48:40.327
So do you study Tina?

901
00:48:40.351 --> 00:48:43.085
Yeah, but I don't think I got
my college degree on her yet.

902
00:48:44.923 --> 00:48:47.868
So tell me a little bit more
about the studying her.

903
00:48:47.892 --> 00:48:50.971
Ah, I'm supposed to, uh,
make her a candlelight dinner,

904
00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:53.440
and then ask her a
whole list of questions.

905
00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:55.943
Well, my advice is go all out.

906
00:48:55.967 --> 00:48:57.278
Meaning?

907
00:48:57.302 --> 00:48:58.645
Don't go cheap.

908
00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:00.847
If you don't cook, get it
from a good restaurant.

909
00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:02.649
Take it home, use
your best dishes,

910
00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:05.386
glasses, music, everything.

911
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.343
Make it a memorable date.

912
00:49:10.048 --> 00:49:12.026
Man, what you talking about?

913
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.527
You ain't had a date in a year.

914
00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:15.362
I'm like a fine wine.

915
00:49:15.386 --> 00:49:17.831
I need about 35 years
to reach perfection.

916
00:49:17.855 --> 00:49:19.633
But the lady that
gets Wayne Floyd,

917
00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:21.468
she'll get the complete package.

918
00:49:21.492 --> 00:49:22.702
You mean complete wreckage.

919
00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:23.737
No.

920
00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:26.907
I'm 255 pounds of pure love.

921
00:49:26.931 --> 00:49:28.475
All you need to
make marriage work

922
00:49:28.499 --> 00:49:30.010
is a little bit of romance.

923
00:49:30.034 --> 00:49:31.878
And that comes from right here.

924
00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:35.115
Man, that's easy to say when
you ain't never been married.

925
00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:36.883
It's a lot harder
than you think, man.

926
00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:39.753
One day I'm gonna walk in here
with a tanned beauty on my arm.

927
00:49:39.777 --> 00:49:41.322
I'll show you how
easy it can be.

928
00:49:41.346 --> 00:49:43.324
Man, the only thing
you'll come in here with

929
00:49:43.348 --> 00:49:45.348
hanging from your arm
is a bucket of chicken.

930
00:49:48.152 --> 00:49:49.986
It was tomato juice.

931
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.245
Tomato juice? Man, that's wrong!

932
00:50:05.269 --> 00:50:08.048
That's wrong. What's wrong?

933
00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:10.484
I drank the real stuff and
he drank tomato juice?

934
00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:11.618
You just got that?

935
00:50:11.642 --> 00:50:13.253
Do you know what
that stuff did to me?

936
00:50:13.277 --> 00:50:14.989
Go to bed, Wayne.

937
00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:17.157
There's some
serious repercussions!

938
00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:18.859
Quiet.

939
00:50:18.883 --> 00:50:21.828
Oh, it's on now.

940
00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:24.231
Done lit a fuse.

941
00:50:24.255 --> 00:50:27.089
Somebody's gonna get
a karate-chop sandwich.

942
00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.066
What are you doing?

943
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:49.671
Maybe I'd like to have
dinner with my wife.

944
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.900
Let me be real clear
with you about something.

945
00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:03.397
I do not love you.

946
00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:51.445
Oh, son.

947
00:52:51.469 --> 00:52:53.902
This is when it gets hard.

948
00:52:55.306 --> 00:52:56.450
Hello, Caleb.

949
00:52:56.474 --> 00:52:57.851
We're done, Dad.

950
00:52:57.875 --> 00:52:59.319
I am not gonna keep doing this.

951
00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:02.122
I have tried and
there's nothing there.

952
00:53:02.146 --> 00:53:03.457
It's not worth it.

953
00:53:03.481 --> 00:53:06.059
I understand, son, but
you're halfway there,

954
00:53:06.083 --> 00:53:08.128
which was the most
difficult for us too.

955
00:53:08.152 --> 00:53:11.097
But at least you had some
hope. She has given me nothing.

956
00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:13.321
<i>There was a point when
we had no hope either.</i>

957
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:16.336
Our marriage should
have ended, Caleb.

958
00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.772
You can't listen to the
way you feel at the moment.

959
00:53:18.796 --> 00:53:20.474
<i>There's no doubt
she's seen you trying.</i>

960
00:53:20.498 --> 00:53:22.108
No, she doesn't care, Dad.

961
00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:24.978
None of this means
anything to her.

962
00:53:25.002 --> 00:53:26.502
Dad, I tried.

963
00:53:28.206 --> 00:53:29.505
Caleb, are you off tomorrow?

964
00:53:30.408 --> 00:53:31.585
Yeah, why?

965
00:53:31.609 --> 00:53:34.510
I'm coming to see
you. We can talk then.

966
00:53:35.846 --> 00:53:37.624
Dad, you don't have to do that.

967
00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:41.116
I want to, son.
I'd like to come.

968
00:53:43.221 --> 00:53:45.020
All right.

969
00:54:11.749 --> 00:54:13.460
Dad, I gotta be honest with you.

970
00:54:13.484 --> 00:54:17.063
I feel bad that you drove four
hours just to come see me.

971
00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:20.834
It was good. It gave me
time to think and pray.

972
00:54:20.858 --> 00:54:23.803
So, uh, what are you on, Day 20?

973
00:54:23.827 --> 00:54:25.739
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

974
00:54:25.763 --> 00:54:29.376
Yeah. I'd say the halfway
point was the hardest for us.

975
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.511
Why?

976
00:54:31.535 --> 00:54:33.714
Well, it's when you determine

977
00:54:33.738 --> 00:54:35.349
whether your
heart's in it or not.

978
00:54:35.373 --> 00:54:36.850
Makes you check
your real motives

979
00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:39.386
when things get difficult.

980
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:41.622
Yeah? Did Mom
give you a hard time?

981
00:54:41.646 --> 00:54:45.626
No. I thought your mother had
a pretty good attitude about it.

982
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.027
Yeah, well, Catherine's
not buying any of it.

983
00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.263
Why do you think that is?

984
00:54:49.287 --> 00:54:50.930
Because she doesn't love me.

985
00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:52.366
She doesn't even like me.

986
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:56.270
Dad, she's just about
ignored everything I've done.

987
00:54:56.294 --> 00:54:58.960
Are you reading
everything on each page?

988
00:55:00.698 --> 00:55:03.009
You mean the Bible
verses at the bottom of it?

989
00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:05.011
No, I'm not, Dad. I...

990
00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:07.147
I told you, that is
not what I need.

991
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:08.782
And what do you need?

992
00:55:08.806 --> 00:55:10.584
I need Catherine to
wake up to the fact

993
00:55:10.608 --> 00:55:13.487
that we are about to
get an ugly divorce.

994
00:55:13.511 --> 00:55:16.990
And I'm trying to prevent that,
but I cannot do it by myself.

995
00:55:17.014 --> 00:55:20.015
That may be true, but I
think you need more than that.

996
00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:24.731
Dad, if you're gonna tell me
I need Jesus, please don't.

997
00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:27.401
I... I don't need a
crutch to get through life.

998
00:55:27.425 --> 00:55:29.736
Oh, son, Jesus is
much more than a crutch.

999
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.106
He's become the most
significant part of our lives.

1000
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.808
Dad, why do you
keep saying that?

1001
00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:38.111
He's the most significant
part? How...? How is that?

1002
00:55:38.135 --> 00:55:43.317
When I realized who I
was and who he was,

1003
00:55:43.341 --> 00:55:45.485
I realized my need for him.

1004
00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:48.477
I needed his
forgiveness and salvation.

1005
00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.359
See, I... I don't
understand that.

1006
00:55:52.383 --> 00:55:53.893
Why do I need his salvation?

1007
00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:56.330
What, am I gonna
be thrown into hell?

1008
00:55:56.354 --> 00:55:59.733
For what? Because
I got divorced?

1009
00:55:59.757 --> 00:56:01.435
No.

1010
00:56:01.459 --> 00:56:03.903
Because you
violated his standards.

1011
00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:06.707
What? Thou shall not kill?

1012
00:56:06.731 --> 00:56:09.142
Dad, I help people.
I am a good person.

1013
00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:10.777
According to you.

1014
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:13.513
But God doesn't judge
by your standards.

1015
00:56:13.537 --> 00:56:14.748
He uses his.

1016
00:56:14.772 --> 00:56:15.782
And what are his?

1017
00:56:15.806 --> 00:56:18.218
Well, truth.

1018
00:56:18.242 --> 00:56:19.419
Okay. Love.

1019
00:56:19.443 --> 00:56:21.254
I'm honest. Faithfulness.

1020
00:56:21.278 --> 00:56:23.890
I care about people.
I am those things.

1021
00:56:23.914 --> 00:56:25.492
Sometimes.

1022
00:56:25.516 --> 00:56:30.564
But have you loved God,
the one who gave you life?

1023
00:56:30.588 --> 00:56:36.102
His standards are so high, he
considers hatred to be murder

1024
00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:40.161
and lust to be adultery.

1025
00:56:43.834 --> 00:56:47.146
Oh, Dad, what about
all the good I've done?

1026
00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:49.115
Son, saving someone from a fire

1027
00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:50.817
does not make
you right with God.

1028
00:56:50.841 --> 00:56:53.387
You've broken his commandments.

1029
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:55.977
And one day, you'll
answer to him for that.

1030
00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:06.032
Caleb,

1031
00:57:06.056 --> 00:57:08.602
if I were to ask you why you're
so frustrated with Catherine,

1032
00:57:08.626 --> 00:57:09.925
what would you say?

1033
00:57:14.799 --> 00:57:16.710
She's stubborn.

1034
00:57:16.734 --> 00:57:19.579
She makes everything
difficult for me.

1035
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.415
She's ungrateful.

1036
00:57:21.439 --> 00:57:24.150
She's constantly
griping about something.

1037
00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:26.753
Has she thanked you for anything
you've done the last 20 days?

1038
00:57:26.777 --> 00:57:27.821
No.

1039
00:57:27.845 --> 00:57:30.256
And you'd think
after I washed the car,

1040
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.692
I've changed the oil, do
the dishes, clean the house,

1041
00:57:32.716 --> 00:57:36.563
that she would try to show
me a little bit of gratitude.

1042
00:57:36.587 --> 00:57:38.364
Well, she doesn't.

1043
00:57:38.388 --> 00:57:39.499
In fact, when I come home,

1044
00:57:39.523 --> 00:57:42.502
she makes me feel
like I'm an enemy.

1045
00:57:42.526 --> 00:57:44.571
I'm not even welcome
in my own home, Dad.

1046
00:57:44.595 --> 00:57:46.940
That is what
really ticks me off.

1047
00:57:46.964 --> 00:57:48.207
Dad, for the last three weeks,

1048
00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.343
I have bent over
backwards for her.

1049
00:57:50.367 --> 00:57:51.812
I have tried to demonstrate

1050
00:57:51.836 --> 00:57:54.280
that I still care about
this relationship.

1051
00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:57.150
I bought her flowers,
which she threw away.

1052
00:57:57.174 --> 00:57:59.352
I have taken her
insults and her sarcasm,

1053
00:57:59.376 --> 00:58:00.987
but last night was it.

1054
00:58:01.011 --> 00:58:02.088
I made dinner for her,

1055
00:58:02.112 --> 00:58:04.891
I did everything I
could to demonstrate

1056
00:58:04.915 --> 00:58:07.694
that I care about her,
to show value for her,

1057
00:58:07.718 --> 00:58:09.429
and she spat in my face.

1058
00:58:09.453 --> 00:58:13.132
She does not deserve this,
Dad. I am not doing it anymore.

1059
00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.435
How am I supposed to
show love to somebody

1060
00:58:15.459 --> 00:58:19.461
over and over and over,
who constantly rejects me?

1061
00:58:23.701 --> 00:58:25.133
That's a good question.

1062
00:58:34.945 --> 00:58:37.078
Dad, that is not what I'm doing.

1063
00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:40.293
Isn't it?

1064
00:58:40.317 --> 00:58:41.862
No...

1065
00:58:41.886 --> 00:58:43.797
Dad, that is not
what this is about.

1066
00:58:43.821 --> 00:58:46.199
Son, you just asked me:

1067
00:58:46.223 --> 00:58:48.468
"How can someone show
love over and over again,

1068
00:58:48.492 --> 00:58:51.571
when they're
constantly rejected?"

1069
00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:53.840
Caleb, the answer is:

1070
00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:55.642
You can't love her,

1071
00:58:55.666 --> 00:58:58.667
because you can't give
her what you don't have.

1072
00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:03.750
I couldn't truly
love your mother

1073
00:59:03.774 --> 00:59:06.254
till I understood
what love really was.

1074
00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:10.891
It's not because I get
some reward out of it.

1075
00:59:10.915 --> 00:59:13.226
I've now made a decision
to love your mother

1076
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:15.490
whether she deserves it or not.

1077
00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:20.288
Son, God loves you even
though you don't deserve it.

1078
00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:24.337
Even though you've rejected him.

1079
00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:26.094
Spat in his face.

1080
00:59:28.098 --> 00:59:30.243
God sent Jesus
to die on the cross

1081
00:59:30.267 --> 00:59:33.046
and take the
punishment for your sin

1082
00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:35.537
because he loves you.

1083
00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:40.576
The cross was offensive
to me until I came to it.

1084
00:59:41.912 --> 00:59:43.178
But when I did,

1085
00:59:45.482 --> 00:59:47.794
Jesus Christ changed my life.

1086
00:59:47.818 --> 00:59:50.986
That's when I truly
began to love your mom.

1087
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:56.903
Son, I can't
settle this for you.

1088
00:59:56.927 --> 00:59:59.573
This is between
you and the Lord.

1089
00:59:59.597 --> 01:00:03.031
But I love you too much
not to tell you the truth.

1090
01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:07.836
Can't you see that you need him?

1091
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:17.312
Can't you see that you
need his forgiveness?

1092
01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:22.719
Yes.

1093
01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.423
Will you trust
him with your life?

1094
01:00:58.022 --> 01:01:00.466
Waffle time.

1095
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.969
Hey, man, I'd like to talk
to you about something.

1096
01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.904
What's that?

1097
01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:07.488
Well... Hey, captain.

1098
01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:10.810
I think B shift is trying
to pull a joke on us, man.

1099
01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.812
Salt and pepper
shaker won't come apart.

1100
01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.502
Hey, toss them over here.

1101
01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.985
Thanks, man. Don't forget to
mop the kitchen after breakfast.

1102
01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.341
Yes, sir.

1103
01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.912
You wanna tell me something?

1104
01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.684
Uh, it's about your faith.

1105
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.964
My faith?

1106
01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.098
Yeah.

1107
01:01:32.122 --> 01:01:34.567
What about it?

1108
01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:37.336
Well, I'm in.

1109
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.805
You're in?

1110
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:40.996
Yeah, I'm in.

1111
01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.744
Are you saying that
you wanna be in?

1112
01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:46.680
I'm saying I'm in.

1113
01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:48.614
You're really in? I'm really in.

1114
01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.516
'Cause you can't be
half in and say you're in.

1115
01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.519
You gotta be all in,
brother. I'm saying I'm all in.

1116
01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.488
Oh, Caleb, I can't
believe it, man!

1117
01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:57.757
Yeah. You're my brother.

1118
01:01:57.781 --> 01:01:59.059
I'm your brother? Yeah, man.

1119
01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.760
You're my brother
from another mother,

1120
01:02:00.784 --> 01:02:03.262
but now we got the same father.

1121
01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:05.331
What? I'll explain
it to you later, man.

1122
01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:06.933
This is awesome.

1123
01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:09.202
Does Catherine know? Uh, no.

1124
01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.004
No, I don't think
she'd care right now,

1125
01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:12.572
to tell you the truth.

1126
01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:16.009
She hasn't been taking too
well to this whole love dare thing.

1127
01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:17.310
But you're not done yet, right?

1128
01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:19.012
No, I'm day 21 out of 40.

1129
01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:21.948
But I'll be honest with
you. Up to this point,

1130
01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:24.684
my heart's not been in
it. That's what matters.

1131
01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:27.754
A woman can tell when you're
just going through the motions.

1132
01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.789
That's absolutely right.

1133
01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:31.057
Hey, let me ask you a question.

1134
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.492
Go ahead.

1135
01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:35.595
How did you get off to
such a good start with Tina?

1136
01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:37.230
I mean, why is it
so easy for you?

1137
01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.366
Oh, it's not always been
easy. Marriage takes work, man.

1138
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:43.770
Tina is an incredible wife.

1139
01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:45.914
But we learned a lot
of lessons the hard way.

1140
01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:48.674
Well,

1141
01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.999
at least you haven't
had to face divorce.

1142
01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:56.037
I wish that were true.

1143
01:02:57.174 --> 01:02:59.219
What does that mean?

1144
01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.524
You and Tina been
struggling that much?

1145
01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:05.680
Not me and Tina. But
I did with my first wife.

1146
01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:12.265
What?

1147
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.768
You were married to
someone before Tina?

1148
01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:18.004
For one horrible year.

1149
01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:19.873
I got married for
the wrong reasons.

1150
01:03:19.897 --> 01:03:22.776
Then I turned around and got
a divorce for the wrong reasons.

1151
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.180
Man, I thought I was
just following my heart.

1152
01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:29.149
Michael, I've worked
with you for five years.

1153
01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:30.250
You've never told me that.

1154
01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:31.572
Because I'm not proud of it.

1155
01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:34.988
It was before I gave
my life to the Lord,

1156
01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:36.823
and, man, I was just
only concerned about

1157
01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.180
my rights and my needs.

1158
01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:41.427
Man, I ruined her life.

1159
01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:44.831
But when I gave my life to God,

1160
01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:47.600
I tried to find her, but
she'd already remarried.

1161
01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:51.204
So believe me when I
tell you I got a big scar.

1162
01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:53.795
Man, God meant
marriage to be for life.

1163
01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:59.045
That's why you gotta keep
your vows to Catherine.

1164
01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:02.715
You gotta beg God to teach
you how to be a good husband.

1165
01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:04.417
And don't just follow
your heart, man,

1166
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.452
because your heart
can be deceived.

1167
01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:10.712
But you gotta lead your heart.

1168
01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:18.965
It's just been hard
for me, you know?

1169
01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:21.309
I saw my parents
again yesterday,

1170
01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.471
and, well, Mom's
not doing too well.

1171
01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:29.709
It's amazing how much a
stroke can affect somebody's life.

1172
01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.377
I just...

1173
01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:33.913
I feel like she's
trapped, you know?

1174
01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:36.049
And Dad does his
best to communicate,

1175
01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:38.439
but it's hard for him too.

1176
01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.155
Catherine, I'm so sorry.

1177
01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.924
You seem very close to them.

1178
01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:46.148
I am.

1179
01:04:47.017 --> 01:04:48.561
They had me late
in life so it was like

1180
01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:50.363
growing up with grandparents.

1181
01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.797
So they spoiled you.

1182
01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:54.267
Hey, now. I think they
did a pretty good job.

1183
01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:56.691
They did. They
should be very proud.

1184
01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:00.974
You know, you're kind of
sweet when you wanna be.

1185
01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.141
Kind of?

1186
01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:04.077
Ha-ha. Well, with some training,

1187
01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.845
I think you could
be a fine gentleman.

1188
01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:07.302
Well, are you offering lessons?

1189
01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:12.318
So, what does your mom need?

1190
01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.756
Well, a better wheelchair
and hospital bed

1191
01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.958
would be at the top of the list.

1192
01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:22.595
I've been working with RMS
Medical Supplies to get them,

1193
01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:23.897
but it's so expensive.

1194
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:26.221
Well, you can't put a
price on helping your mom.

1195
01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.769
That's right.

1196
01:05:29.793 --> 01:05:32.171
So it's worth the sacrifice.

1197
01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:34.996
You know, they're lucky
to have you for a daughter.

1198
01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:40.013
Don't look at me like that.
I'm trying to help you out.

1199
01:05:40.037 --> 01:05:41.781
Why does it matter
what my bed looks like?

1200
01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:43.182
I'm the one that sleeps in it.

1201
01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:44.583
What if the chief walks through?

1202
01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.886
My bed says I take
my job seriously.

1203
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:49.588
Your bed says your mama
didn't help you make it up.

1204
01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.690
Teaching another rookie
how to make his bed?

1205
01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.692
Somebody's got to.

1206
01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.895
That looks as bad as
yours did when I taught you.

1207
01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:05.238
<i>Engine 2, Engine 1,

01:06:32.222 --> 01:06:34.000
Be advised we've
received numerous calls

1215
01:06:34.024 --> 01:06:36.502
<i>regarding this structure fire.</i>

1216
01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:38.771
All right. That means
there's something to this one.

1217
01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:41.155
Make sure you're tightened up.

1218
01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.816
Remember your training.
Stay with your partner.

1219
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.285
Yes, sir.

1220
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:53.719
Engine 1 is 10-23.

1221
01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:56.922
We have a single-story brick
dwelling, 30 percent involved.

1222
01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:59.058
We'll be using a 1"
and 3-quarter for rescue.

1223
01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:01.427
We'll be 11th Avenue Command.
Engine 2, bring me a line.

1224
01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:05.264
Be advised there is a
hydrant right next to Engine 1.

1225
01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:08.208
<i>Unit 2's clear. One supply line.</i>

1226
01:07:08.625 --> 01:07:10.669
Come on, rookie, let's go.

1227
01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:13.239
You live here? Is
everyone out of the house?

1228
01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:16.009
My daughter's in the neighbor's
house. This is our home.

1229
01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:18.677
Please, put that fire out.
We will, just stay clear.

1230
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.813
Please, please. Oh, no. No!

1231
01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:23.116
Megan, Megan, where's Lacey?

1232
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.750
She went home already.

1233
01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:26.386
What? She's not at your house?

1234
01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.787
No, I was just talking
to her on the phone.

1235
01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.645
Lacey!

1236
01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.426
- You can't go in there.
- Lacey!

1237
01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:36.329
You can't go in there. Let
me go. Please let me go.

1238
01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.431
My baby!

1239
01:07:38.455 --> 01:07:40.775
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, guys, let's go.

1240
01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:44.937
Lacey!

1241
01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:48.930
My baby. Oh!

1242
01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:53.812
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

1243
01:07:55.038 --> 01:07:56.304
Let's go.

1244
01:07:58.175 --> 01:08:00.135
It's done. Charge.

1245
01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:10.129
Lacey!

1246
01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:11.433
Lacey!

1247
01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:13.955
Lacey!

1248
01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.358
Lacey!

1249
01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:21.262
Lacey!

1250
01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.043
Get in there,
guys, get in there.

1251
01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:25.587
Lacey.

1252
01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:33.252
Lacey! Lacey!

1253
01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.477
Come on. Over
here, man. Over here.

1254
01:08:45.655 --> 01:08:47.522
Back out, back out, back out.

1255
01:09:02.539 --> 01:09:04.272
Over here!

1256
01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:06.774
Over here!

1257
01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:16.395
There's a hydrant over there.

1258
01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:18.364
Give me one supply
line to Engine 1.

1259
01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:20.500
Hey, we got two people
inside. We need you.

1260
01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.468
Hey, hurry up with
that supply line.

1261
01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:24.570
Get back in there,
get back in there.

1262
01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.295
Breathe. Breathe,
Lacey. Breathe for me.

1263
01:09:29.132 --> 01:09:30.809
Captain, you gotta
get out of the house.

1264
01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:32.612
The roof is about to give.

1265
01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:35.548
<i>Captain, do you read
me? You've gotta get out.</i>

1266
01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:42.588
God, get me out of
here. Get us out of here.

1267
01:11:39.195 --> 01:11:40.762
There, there!

1268
01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:44.499
Get the girl. Get the girl.

1269
01:11:56.946 --> 01:11:58.491
With the x-ray showing that,

1270
01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:01.582
he's left with a partial
thickness burn to the arm.

1271
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:07.822
You look terrible.

1272
01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.173
I feel terrible.

1273
01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.441
You gonna be okay?

1274
01:12:15.465 --> 01:12:18.165
He sustained some first-degree
burns, but he should be fine.

1275
01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:21.369
So this is your husband?

1276
01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:24.784
Yes.

1277
01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:26.952
Looks like you've got
a hero on your hands.

1278
01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:29.822
Sir, I need you to keep this arm
elevated for the next 24 hours,

1279
01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:31.457
to help the swelling go down.

1280
01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:33.892
Then come back in 48 hours
to get it checked out again.

1281
01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:35.361
Well, let me get
out of your way.

1282
01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:37.630
Oh, no, you're not in
our way. You can stay.

1283
01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:41.088
No, it's all right. I'll
let you do your job.

1284
01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:46.539
Sir, I'm gonna get you more
gauze to take home with you

1285
01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:49.003
and fill that prescription
for your pain, okay?

1286
01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:02.020
I wouldn't put that
ring back on your finger

1287
01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:04.579
until your hand has
a chance to heal.

1288
01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:08.883
My hand's gonna have to
heal with this ring on my finger.

1289
01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.740
Mom, it'll be fine.

1290
01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:22.997
It's gonna heal up
in a couple of weeks.

1291
01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.011
Yes, I got it
wrapped up right now.

1292
01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.335
Can I speak with Dad, please?

1293
01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:30.483
Okay, Mom, I got it.

1294
01:13:30.507 --> 01:13:33.886
Now, would you please
hand the phone to Dad?

1295
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.921
Thank you.

1296
01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:40.259
Dad, would you please ask
Mom to cut me some slack?

1297
01:13:40.283 --> 01:13:43.729
I'm a fireman. I'm
gonna be around fires.

1298
01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:44.930
I know. I know, Dad.

1299
01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:46.432
I just don't like
getting grilled

1300
01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:48.776
every time she
picks up the phone.

1301
01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.040
Uh, yeah. Today, Day 23.

1302
01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:57.410
But it was hard this morning.

1303
01:13:57.434 --> 01:14:00.413
Yeah, the newspaper called
me twice wanting an interview.

1304
01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:04.617
Seems I'm a hero with everybody
in the world except my wife.

1305
01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:07.174
No. No, I'm not giving up.

1306
01:14:08.511 --> 01:14:09.977
Thanks, Dad.

1307
01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.158
All right, I'll
talk to you later.

1308
01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.449
Bye.

1309
01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:07.034
Caleb, what are you doing?

1310
01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:41.368
Why is this so hard?

1311
01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:59.698
<i>Day 23: Watch out for parasites.</i>

1312
01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:01.634
<i>A parasite is anything</i>

1313
01:16:01.658 --> 01:16:03.602
<i>that latches onto
you or your partner</i>

1314
01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:06.104
<i>and sucks the life
out of your marriage.</i>

1315
01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:09.174
<i>They're usually in the form
of addictions like gambling,</i>

1316
01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:11.043
<i>drugs or pornography.</i>

1317
01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:13.946
<i>They promise pleasure,
but they grow like a disease</i>

1318
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:15.080
<i>and consume more and more</i>

1319
01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:17.249
<i>of your thoughts,
time and money.</i>

1320
01:16:17.273 --> 01:16:21.687
<i>They steal away your loyalty
and heart from those you love.</i>

1321
01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:24.757
<i>Marriages rarely survive
if parasites are present.</i>

1322
01:16:24.781 --> 01:16:26.358
<i>If you love your wife,</i>

1323
01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:30.362
<i>you must destroy any
addiction that has your heart.</i>

1324
01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:34.366
<i>If you don't, it
will destroy you.</i>

1325
01:16:58.615 --> 01:17:02.182
Okay, Lord. No more addictions.

1326
01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:20.801
Mr. Rudolph.

1327
01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.271
Caleb.

1328
01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.020
You doing okay today?

1329
01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:30.577
No, not really.

1330
01:17:47.096 --> 01:17:51.110
Irma, I don't want
you talking to that guy.

1331
01:17:51.134 --> 01:17:54.446
He is weird.

1332
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.371
Takes one to know one.

1333
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.673
What?

1334
01:19:52.922 --> 01:19:55.134
No.

1335
01:19:55.158 --> 01:19:56.423
No.

1336
01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.575
Good morning. Hi, Mrs.
Evans, how are you?

1337
01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:39.477
I'm fine. I hope you are.

1338
01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.913
I'm doing pretty good.

1339
01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:42.547
Um, I actually
wanted to talk to you

1340
01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.716
about some of the equipment
we've been looking at.

1341
01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.919
Oh, I bet your
parents are excited.

1342
01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:48.720
When a patient gets
the right wheelchair,

1343
01:20:48.744 --> 01:20:50.388
it can make such a difference.

1344
01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:52.124
I'm sorry, what?

1345
01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:53.892
I'm talking about the
bed and wheelchair

1346
01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.156
we delivered to your
parents this morning.

1347
01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:58.263
To my parents?

1348
01:20:58.287 --> 01:21:00.833
Yes, they should have
been delivered by now.

1349
01:21:00.857 --> 01:21:03.635
But I haven't paid
for anything yet.

1350
01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:05.838
Oh, it's actually
already been paid for.

1351
01:21:05.862 --> 01:21:08.673
A gentleman called and
said that he wanted to pay

1352
01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.675
for everything that
you'd picked out.

1353
01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:14.679
Actually, he covered everything
plus some accessories.

1354
01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:16.370
He said...

1355
01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:19.251
Mrs. Holt?

1356
01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:42.374
Isn't this wonderful?
Oh, she looks amazing.

1357
01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:44.498
Hi, Mom.

1358
01:22:04.053 --> 01:22:07.665
Has anyone ever told
you that you're wonderful?

1359
01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:09.801
Maybe, but not today.

1360
01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:12.704
Gavin, you didn't
have to do that.

1361
01:22:12.728 --> 01:22:15.796
Do what? Giving money
to help my parents.

1362
01:22:16.832 --> 01:22:18.265
That was so thoughtful.

1363
01:22:19.735 --> 01:22:21.380
Thank you.

1364
01:22:21.404 --> 01:22:23.081
You're welcome.

1365
01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.806
It was the least I could do.

1366
01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:32.079
Do you have lunch
plans? I do now.

1367
01:22:55.137 --> 01:22:56.714
"Dear Catherine.

1368
01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:59.739
"I can't tell you how much I've
enjoyed getting to know you.

1369
01:23:00.977 --> 01:23:04.289
"I find myself thinking
about you often,

1370
01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:07.759
"and I look forward to
seeing you every day.

1371
01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:09.816
Gavin."

1372
01:23:13.622 --> 01:23:16.234
Uh, yeah, I need to
know if there's a Gavin

1373
01:23:16.258 --> 01:23:18.225
that works at the hospital.

1374
01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:22.062
Uh, no, I just
have a first name.

1375
01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:41.793
Dr. Keller?

1376
01:23:41.817 --> 01:23:45.097
Yes? Caleb Holt.

1377
01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:47.399
I need a word with you, please.

1378
01:23:47.423 --> 01:23:50.235
It's really not a good time.
I'm about to make my rounds.

1379
01:23:50.259 --> 01:23:52.837
I think you need to make time.

1380
01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:56.063
This is concerning
Catherine, my wife.

1381
01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:01.068
All right, what
can I do for you?

1382
01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:04.983
I know what you're doing.

1383
01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:06.751
And I have no intention
of stepping aside

1384
01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:08.586
as you try to steal
my wife's heart.

1385
01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:13.291
I've made some
mistakes, but I still love her.

1386
01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:16.216
So just know I am
going after her too.

1387
01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:19.631
And since I'm married to her,

1388
01:24:19.655 --> 01:24:21.936
I'd say I've got a head start.

1389
01:24:23.959 --> 01:24:26.104
By the way,

1390
01:24:26.128 --> 01:24:28.740
thanks for helping
me with my hand.

1391
01:24:28.764 --> 01:24:31.244
My ring finger's feeling
a whole lot better.

1392
01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:06.511
Y'all, I just saw
Caleb and Dr. Keller

1393
01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:07.612
going at each other.

1394
01:25:07.636 --> 01:25:10.449
He had his fist all
knuckled in his face.

1395
01:25:10.473 --> 01:25:12.713
Are you serious? Shh.

1396
01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:16.588
What are you all talking about?

1397
01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:18.623
Hey, Cat, how you doing, girl?

1398
01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:21.859
I'm fine. You sure
got quiet really fast.

1399
01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:24.229
Well, that's because we
decided to stop talking.

1400
01:25:24.253 --> 01:25:25.830
What's up?

1401
01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:28.233
I'm setting up an interview
in about 10 minutes,

1402
01:25:28.257 --> 01:25:29.534
but I was wondering if you guys

1403
01:25:29.558 --> 01:25:32.204
have seen Dr. Keller
this morning.

1404
01:25:32.228 --> 01:25:34.906
Um, I think he was doing
rounds, maybe on the 8th Floor.

1405
01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.742
Okay, well, I'll
see y'all later.

1406
01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:39.266
See you.

1407
01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:42.647
Why didn't you tell her?

1408
01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:45.417
'Cause it ain't our business.
But you told all of us.

1409
01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:47.619
I don't want her to know
her business is our business

1410
01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:49.621
if it ain't none
of our business.

1411
01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:51.645
Oh. Oh.

1412
01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:54.822
Hi.

1413
01:25:55.618 --> 01:25:57.395
Hey, how are you?

1414
01:25:57.419 --> 01:26:00.832
Ugh. Hey, Catherine.
How's the good doctor today?

1415
01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:03.502
Uh, pretty busy, actually.

1416
01:26:03.526 --> 01:26:05.837
Are we still on for lunch?

1417
01:26:05.861 --> 01:26:08.440
You know, there's a few
things I need to catch up on.

1418
01:26:08.464 --> 01:26:10.175
I've gotten a
little behind lately.

1419
01:26:10.199 --> 01:26:11.376
Okay.

1420
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:12.944
Um, well, maybe
we could talk later.

1421
01:26:12.968 --> 01:26:14.479
That'd be good.

1422
01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:16.314
All right, um, see you around.

1423
01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:17.671
See you.

1424
01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:32.464
Hello, Catherine. Oh,
hi, Anna. How are you?

1425
01:26:32.488 --> 01:26:34.832
I'm doing well. And you?

1426
01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.402
I'm okay, I guess. Do
you wanna sit down?

1427
01:26:37.426 --> 01:26:39.337
I'd love to if I'm
not disturbing you.

1428
01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:41.061
Not at all.

1429
01:26:42.731 --> 01:26:45.677
So, what's been going
on in your life these days?

1430
01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.834
We haven't talked in a while.

1431
01:26:49.338 --> 01:26:52.284
Well, it... It's been
one of those years.

1432
01:26:52.308 --> 01:26:55.520
Oh? Good or bad?

1433
01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:59.546
You know, I hate to
say it, but mostly bad.

1434
01:27:00.249 --> 01:27:01.693
Hm.

1435
01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:03.961
You know when you
get to a fork in the road

1436
01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:05.564
and you know that
either way you go

1437
01:27:05.588 --> 01:27:07.131
is gonna change your life?

1438
01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:09.967
Life does give
you some of those.

1439
01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:11.625
Excuse me just a minute.

1440
01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:20.393
So have you decided
which path to take?

1441
01:27:21.303 --> 01:27:24.583
Um, I think so.

1442
01:27:24.607 --> 01:27:27.107
It's just hard not to
second-guess yourself.

1443
01:27:28.844 --> 01:27:31.823
Pardon me, I don't mean to pry,

1444
01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:34.287
but does this
concern relationships?

1445
01:27:36.352 --> 01:27:37.562
It does.

1446
01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:40.832
Catherine, you're so young.

1447
01:27:40.856 --> 01:27:44.001
I would encourage you to
make your choices carefully.

1448
01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:46.526
I'm trying to.

1449
01:27:49.398 --> 01:27:51.431
But I'm also tired
of feeling empty.

1450
01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:55.447
Anna, it's so nice to
have someone treat you

1451
01:27:55.471 --> 01:27:57.882
like they really care about you.

1452
01:27:57.906 --> 01:27:59.784
Forgive me, but
you're talking about

1453
01:27:59.808 --> 01:28:02.576
a certain young
doctor, aren't you?

1454
01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:06.824
I suppose it's no secret
as much as he and I talk.

1455
01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:11.162
I couldn't help but notice
how you act around each other.

1456
01:28:11.186 --> 01:28:15.021
But I also wonder how
your husband would feel.

1457
01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:21.640
My husband has had his chance.

1458
01:28:21.664 --> 01:28:23.975
And Dr. Keller is a good man.

1459
01:28:23.999 --> 01:28:27.612
He treats me better than my
husband has treated me in years.

1460
01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:31.015
He listens to me and
makes me feel important.

1461
01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:34.051
I haven't felt that way
in a very long time.

1462
01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:37.522
It's always good
to have that, but...

1463
01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:40.825
But, sweetheart, if this
doctor is trying to woo you

1464
01:28:40.849 --> 01:28:42.994
while you're still married,

1465
01:28:43.018 --> 01:28:46.864
what makes you think he
won't do that with someone else?

1466
01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:49.200
Ahem. I don't think I
wanna talk about this, Anna.

1467
01:28:49.224 --> 01:28:50.702
We're getting a little personal.

1468
01:28:50.726 --> 01:28:52.737
Oh, Catherine, I'm sorry.

1469
01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:54.773
I didn't mean to
overstep my bounds.

1470
01:28:54.797 --> 01:28:57.197
I need to go. It's
good to see you, Anna.

1513

Catherine, are you okay?

1514
01:32:49.431 --> 01:32:51.009
I'm fine.

1515
01:32:51.033 --> 01:32:52.810
Aren't you going to work?

1516
01:32:52.834 --> 01:32:54.100
No.

1517
01:33:00.475 --> 01:33:01.686
Are you sick?

1518
01:33:01.710 --> 01:33:03.610
I'll be fine.

1519
01:33:06.548 --> 01:33:07.914
Is it your allergies?

1520
01:33:09.284 --> 01:33:11.851
I said I'll be fine.
Don't worry about me.

1521
01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:16.834
Because if you need
something, I can go to the store.

1522
01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:18.469
No, I'm okay. You can go.

1523
01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.764
Okay.

1524
01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:54.794
Can you sit up for me?

1525
01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:08.141
You got a fever.

1526
01:34:36.772 --> 01:34:37.871
Here.

1527
01:34:38.874 --> 01:34:41.074
You think you can take this?

1528
01:34:57.726 --> 01:34:59.258
Why are you doing this?

1529
01:35:01.763 --> 01:35:06.243
I have learned you
never leave your partner.

1530
01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:08.168
Especially in a fire.

1531
01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:14.007
Caleb, what's happened to you?

1532
01:35:18.513 --> 01:35:20.624
Dad asked me if there
was anything in me

1533
01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:22.582
that wanted to
save our marriage.

1534
01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.453
And then he gave me something.

1535
01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:30.201
Um...

1536
01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:31.424
I-I could let you read it.

1537
01:35:39.334 --> 01:35:40.734
Was it this?

1538
01:35:42.804 --> 01:35:45.583
How long have you known?

1539
01:35:45.607 --> 01:35:48.208
I found it yesterday.

1540
01:35:49.044 --> 01:35:50.710
So, what day are you on?

1541
01:35:51.546 --> 01:35:53.780
Uh, forty-three.

1542
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:56.482
There's only 40.

1543
01:35:59.387 --> 01:36:01.921
Who says I have to stop?

1544
01:36:09.664 --> 01:36:12.143
Caleb,

1545
01:36:12.167 --> 01:36:14.567
I don't know how
to process this.

1546
01:36:15.904 --> 01:36:18.571
This is not normal for you.

1547
01:36:20.909 --> 01:36:23.409
Welcome to the new normal.

1548
01:36:29.184 --> 01:36:31.818
You didn't wanna do
this at first, did you?

1549
01:36:34.890 --> 01:36:36.322
No.

1550
01:36:37.893 --> 01:36:40.704
But halfway through, I realized

1551
01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:44.097
that I did not understand
what love was.

1552
01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.146
And once I understood that,

1553
01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:51.048
I wanted to do it.

1554
01:36:51.072 --> 01:36:55.441
Caleb, I want to
believe that this is real.

1555
01:36:56.945 --> 01:37:00.479
But I am not ready to
say that I trust you again.

1556
01:37:02.517 --> 01:37:04.284
I understand that.

1557
01:37:07.889 --> 01:37:10.890
But whether you ever
reach that point or not,

1558
01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:15.461
I need you to
understand something.

1559
01:37:35.917 --> 01:37:37.717
I am sorry.

1560
01:37:45.827 --> 01:37:47.760
I have been so selfish.

1561
01:37:52.734 --> 01:37:56.780
For the past seven years,
I have trampled on you

1562
01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:59.873
with my words and
with my actions.

1563
01:38:03.879 --> 01:38:08.481
I have loved other things
when I should have loved you.

1564
01:38:14.322 --> 01:38:17.368
In the last few weeks,

1565
01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:22.695
God has given me a love for
you that I had never had before.

1566
01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:27.800
And I have asked
him to forgive me.

1567
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:31.682
And I am hoping,

1568
01:38:31.706 --> 01:38:33.873
I am praying

1569
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:39.212
that somehow you would
be able to forgive me too.

1570
01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:51.291
Catherine, I do not want to live
the rest of my life without you.

1571
01:39:03.638 --> 01:39:05.783
Caleb, I'm supposed to
give those divorce papers

1572
01:39:05.807 --> 01:39:07.840
to my lawyer next week.

1573
01:39:10.078 --> 01:39:11.777
I just, um...

1574
01:39:15.583 --> 01:39:17.550
I need some time

1575
01:39:18.653 --> 01:39:20.086
to think.

1576
01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:31.742
You can have all
the time you need.

1577
01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:01.238
Hello, Mrs. Holt,
how are you today?

1578
01:40:01.262 --> 01:40:02.306
Fine, thanks.

1579
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:04.741
I hope your parents
are doing well.

1580
01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:06.944
That new bed and wheelchair
are certainly helping.

1581
01:40:06.968 --> 01:40:08.212
I'm so glad.

1582
01:40:08.236 --> 01:40:09.746
Well, what can I
do for you today?

1583
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:12.249
You know, I just need
to pick up a few linens

1584
01:40:12.273 --> 01:40:13.617
for the hospital bed for my mom.

1585
01:40:13.641 --> 01:40:15.586
Sure, we have some in stock.

1586
01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:16.988
Great, that's the only thing

1587
01:40:17.012 --> 01:40:18.456
that wasn't covered
by the doctor

1588
01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.324
when he purchased
that bed and wheelchair.

1589
01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:22.059
The doctor?

1590
01:40:22.083 --> 01:40:26.297
Yes, Dr. Keller, our
secret philanthropist.

1591
01:40:26.321 --> 01:40:30.201
Uh, I don't think Dr. Keller
covered those things.

1592
01:40:30.225 --> 01:40:32.358
No, I'm sure he did. I
spoke with him about it.

1593
01:40:33.461 --> 01:40:36.340
Mrs. Holt, if I
remember correctly,

1594
01:40:36.364 --> 01:40:40.611
$24,300 was given for
the bed and wheelchair,

1595
01:40:40.635 --> 01:40:43.247
but Dr. Keller was
not the main giver.

1596
01:40:43.271 --> 01:40:44.915
What?

1597
01:40:44.939 --> 01:40:48.874
Of the amount given,
Dr. Keller gave $300.

1598
01:40:53.048 --> 01:40:54.580
Then who gave the other?

1599
01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:58.129
Your husband, Caleb.

1600
01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:02.933
He came in about two weeks
ago and paid for everything.

1601
01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:04.757
I assumed you knew.

1602
01:41:06.794 --> 01:41:08.506
Two weeks ago?

1603
01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:10.741
Yes, he told me
not to tell anyone,

1604
01:41:10.765 --> 01:41:13.444
but I didn't think
that included you.

1605
01:41:13.468 --> 01:41:15.979
It was the Tuesday before last.

1606
01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:17.814
He called and
asked what the price

1607
01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:20.017
of a particular bed
and wheelchair were.

1608
01:41:20.041 --> 01:41:21.285
And I looked it up and...

1609
01:41:43.531 --> 01:41:45.098
Oh, where is it?

1610
01:42:43.691 --> 01:42:45.691
Oh, stop crying.

1611
01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:55.579
Okay, explain RECEO.

1612
01:42:55.603 --> 01:42:57.148
Oh.

1613
01:42:57.172 --> 01:42:58.349
He ain't gonna get it.

1614
01:42:58.373 --> 01:43:03.887
Rescue, exposure,
containment, extinguish...

1615
01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:06.823
Captain, can I see
you for a minute?

1616
01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.058
Right now?

1617
01:43:08.082 --> 01:43:09.362
Yes, sir.

1618
01:43:14.289 --> 01:43:16.400
Something wrong?

1619
01:43:16.424 --> 01:43:18.335
Catherine is in the bay.

1620
01:43:19.494 --> 01:43:21.860
My Catherine? Yes, sir.

1621
01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:44.049
Catherine?

1622
01:43:49.657 --> 01:43:52.169
If I haven't told you

1623
01:43:53.695 --> 01:43:56.095
that you are a good man,

1624
01:43:57.365 --> 01:43:58.564
you are.

1625
01:44:03.738 --> 01:44:06.372
And if I haven't told you

1626
01:44:07.275 --> 01:44:08.741
that I've forgiven you,

1627
01:44:10.211 --> 01:44:11.955
I have.

1628
01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:24.342
And if I haven't told you

1629
01:44:25.126 --> 01:44:27.460
that I love you,

1630
01:44:28.062 --> 01:44:29.228
I do.

1631
01:44:33.268 --> 01:44:36.602
Something has
changed in you, Caleb.

1632
01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:41.140
And I want what happened
to you to happen to me.

1633
01:44:47.382 --> 01:44:49.114
It can.

1634
01:44:50.885 --> 01:44:56.855
Is it too late to ask you
to grow old with me?

1663

Caleb.

1664
01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:43.496

Hi, son.

1668
01:46:58.546 --> 01:47:01.859
I'm getting to where I
know this trail pretty well.

1669
01:47:01.883 --> 01:47:03.827
You're welcome
to walk it anytime.

1670
01:47:03.851 --> 01:47:05.150
I just might.

1671
01:47:06.654 --> 01:47:08.454
I wanna thank you, Dad.

1672
01:47:09.457 --> 01:47:11.968
The love dare changed my life.

1673
01:47:11.992 --> 01:47:13.904
God changed your life.

1674
01:47:13.928 --> 01:47:17.441
The love dare was
just a tool he used.

1675
01:47:17.465 --> 01:47:19.576
I've already given it
to one of my firemen.

1676
01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.568
Good. It's meant
to be passed on.

1677
01:47:24.338 --> 01:47:26.450
I just can't tell you
how grateful I am

1678
01:47:26.474 --> 01:47:28.954
that you didn't
give up on me, Dad.

1679
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:31.950
Or on Mom, for that matter.

1680
01:47:35.783 --> 01:47:39.952
Caleb, I wanna be a godly man.

1681
01:47:40.922 --> 01:47:43.255
And I'm learning so much.

1682
01:47:44.525 --> 01:47:46.358
But there's something
I haven't told you.

1683
01:47:49.396 --> 01:47:52.743
I wrote that notebook
in my own handwriting

1684
01:47:52.767 --> 01:47:55.267
because I knew you
would accept it from me.

1685
01:47:56.704 --> 01:47:59.616
But I didn't do the
love dare on your mom.

1686
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.640
She did it to me.

1687
01:48:04.512 --> 01:48:05.923
What?

1688
01:48:05.947 --> 01:48:06.924
Son,

1689
01:48:06.948 --> 01:48:10.282
I was the one that
wanted to leave.

1690
01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:13.285
But God got ahold of your mother

1691
01:48:14.655 --> 01:48:16.032
and she prayed,

1692
01:48:16.056 --> 01:48:18.902
and loved me unconditionally.

1693
01:48:18.926 --> 01:48:22.995
It was through her example
that I came to Christ.

1694
01:48:25.633 --> 01:48:27.277
Mom did this?

1695
01:48:27.301 --> 01:48:29.379
She's such a blessing to me.

1696
01:48:29.403 --> 01:48:32.583
And she's grown so much.

1697
01:48:32.607 --> 01:48:35.207
I love her with all my heart.

1698
01:48:38.546 --> 01:48:40.145
Dad, I...

1699
01:48:41.649 --> 01:48:44.094
I have treated her so wrong.

1700
01:48:44.118 --> 01:48:45.829
Caleb,

1701
01:48:45.853 --> 01:48:48.654
she deserves your respect.

1702
01:49:16.684 --> 01:49:19.284
Mom. Mom, I'm so sorry.

1703
01:49:21.455 --> 01:49:23.967
Mom, I didn't
know. I didn't know.

1704
01:49:23.991 --> 01:49:27.225
It's all right, son.
It's okay. It's all right.

1705
01:49:30.565 --> 01:49:32.609
Mom, please forgive me.

1706
01:49:32.633 --> 01:49:34.878
I do, Caleb. You're forgiven.

1707
01:49:34.902 --> 01:49:36.468
I love you.

1708
01:49:38.039 --> 01:49:40.116
I love you too, Mom.

1709
01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.340
I love you so much.

1710
01:49:45.079 --> 01:49:47.624
I love you, Caleb.

1711
01:49:56.657 --> 01:49:58.835
We've gathered here
today to celebrate

1712
01:49:58.859 --> 01:50:01.271
the reaffirmation of vows
with Caleb and Catherine.

1713
01:50:01.295 --> 01:50:02.973
And whereas this
may be the second time

1714
01:50:02.997 --> 01:50:04.942
they have made a
commitment to this marriage,

1715
01:50:04.966 --> 01:50:07.110
it is the first time they've
done so on a foundation

1716
01:50:07.134 --> 01:50:09.947
of faith in Jesus Christ.

1717
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:11.982
"It is the desire of
Caleb and Catherine

1718
01:50:12.006 --> 01:50:14.851
"to establish their
vows from this point on

1719
01:50:14.875 --> 01:50:17.721
"as a covenant
and not a contract.

1720
01:50:17.745 --> 01:50:21.091
"For marriage is a sacred
institution established by God,

1721
01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:24.116
and one that is
meant to last for life."

1722
01:50:28.422 --> 01:50:32.002
"Caleb, in the presence of
God and these witnesses,

1723
01:50:32.026 --> 01:50:35.405
"do you come today to freely
and unconditionally commit

1724
01:50:35.429 --> 01:50:38.008
to this covenant
marriage to Catherine?"

1725
01:50:38.032 --> 01:50:40.577
I do.

1726
01:50:40.601 --> 01:50:43.213
"And Catherine,
do you come today

1727
01:50:43.237 --> 01:50:45.281
"to freely and
unconditionally commit

1728
01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.818
to this covenant
marriage to Caleb?"

leave his father and mother

and shall be joined to his wife,

1734

and the two shall
become one flesh.
