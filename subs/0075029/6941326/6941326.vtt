DUST TO DUST.

27
00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:16.904
LORD GIVES...

28
00:04:18.742 --> 00:04:21.576
LORD TAKES AWAY.

29
00:06:22.098 --> 00:06:24.032
NAME'S ANDERSON.

30
00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:29.838
BLOODY BILL'S WHAT THEY CALL ME.

31
00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:35.009
REDLEGS?

32
00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:40.388
YOU'LL FIND THEM UP IN KANSAS.

33
00:06:41.251 --> 00:06:43.411
THEY'RE WITH THE UNION.

34
00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.788
AND WE'RE GOING UP THERE
AND SET THINGS ARIGHT.

35
00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:54.229
I'LL BE COMIN' WITH YOU.

36
00:07:41.978 --> 00:07:43.778
YAH!

37
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.285
ALL THAT A FELLA HAS TO DO

38
00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:40.889
IS RIDE INTO THAT UNION
CAMP DOWN THERE...

39
00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:42.924
RAISE HIS RIGHT HAND,

40
00:10:42.993 --> 00:10:46.594
AND SWEAR AS SUCH TO BE
LOYAL TO THE UNITED STATES.

41
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.464
THEN HE CAN TAKE
UP HIS HORSE AGAIN

42
00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:52.200
AND GO HOME.

43
00:10:57.373 --> 00:10:59.774
THEY'RE GIVING US
FULL AMNESTY, THEN?

44
00:11:00.777 --> 00:11:02.576
YEP.

45
00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:06.380
EVERYONE ELSE
HAS DONE IT BUT US.

46
00:11:07.517 --> 00:11:10.618
WE ARE THE LAST OF THE HOLDOUTS.

47
00:11:21.198 --> 00:11:24.332
I'M GOING IN, BOYS.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

48
00:12:14.751 --> 00:12:15.917
JOSEY.

49
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.723
BETTER GO WITH THEM, BOY.

50
00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:44.178
ARE YOU COMING WITH US, JOSEY?

51
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.390
I RECKON NOT, FLETCHER.

52
00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:51.585
THEY'LL BE COMING
AFTER YOU, JOSEY.

53
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.189
YEAH.

54
00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:57.892
THERE'S NOWHERE YOU CAN
GO TO GET AWAY FROM THEM.

55
00:13:00.496 --> 00:13:02.763
I RECKON THAT'S TRUE.

56
00:13:05.335 --> 00:13:06.600
WELL...

57
00:13:06.669 --> 00:13:08.236
GOOD LUCK, JOSEY.

58
00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.197
PUT THE RIFLE DOWN, TOO.

59
00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:45.699
I'LL BE NEEDING THIS
FOR SQUIRRELS AND SUCH.

60
00:14:45.768 --> 00:14:46.834
PUT IT DOWN.

61
00:14:51.774 --> 00:14:53.641
YOU'RE KIND OF
YOUNG, AIN'T YOU, KID,

62
00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:56.010
TO BE RIDING WITH THIS RABBLE?

63
00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:57.756
WHO YOU CALLING RABBLE,

64
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.214
YOU BLUE SCUM-BELLY?

65
00:15:02.285 --> 00:15:03.717
HELL,

66
00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:05.764
WE SHOWED THESE BOYS ANYWAY.

67
00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:07.166
LEE MIGHT'VE HAD TO SURRENDER,

68
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.834
BUT WE DIDN'T, DID WE?

69
00:15:08.858 --> 00:15:09.790
SHUT UP, KID.

70
00:15:09.859 --> 00:15:12.126
YES, SIR. YOU SHOWED US.

71
00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:14.095
NOW, GET IN LINE

72
00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:15.763
BEFORE I KICK YOU SO HARD,

73
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.698
YOU'LL BE WEARING
YOUR ASS FOR A HAT.

74
00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:29.821
HERE'S THE MAN
YOU ASKED FOR, SIR.

75
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.745
AH, FLETCHER, GOOD TO SEE YOU!

76
00:15:31.814 --> 00:15:32.746
SENATOR.

77
00:15:32.815 --> 00:15:34.148
WELL DONE.

78
00:15:34.217 --> 00:15:35.716
THANK YOU.

79
00:15:39.155 --> 00:15:42.756
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
REDLEG DOING HERE?

80
00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.960
YOU SAID REGULAR
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

81
00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.928
WOULD BE HANDLING THIS.

82
00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:48.997
CAPTAIN TERRILL

83
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.467
IS THE REGULAR
FEDERAL AUTHORITY NOW.

84
00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:56.003
CAPTAIN TERRILL IS A
BLOODTHIRSTY SON OF A BITCH!

85
00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:57.972
HE'S A LOOTER AND A PILLAGER.

86
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.808
HE'S THE WORST ENEMY
THOSE MEN HAVE GOT!

87
00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:02.543
OHH...

88
00:16:02.612 --> 00:16:03.744
WAR'S OVER.

89
00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:08.382
OUR SIDE WON THE WAR.

90
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:11.319
NOW WE MUST BUSY
OURSELVES WINNING THE PEACE.

91
00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:13.354
FLETCHER, THERE'S
AN OLD SAYING...

92
00:16:13.423 --> 00:16:16.457
TO THE VICTORS
BELONG THE SPOILS.

93
00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:26.134
THERE'S ANOTHER
OLD SAYING, SENATOR...

94
00:16:26.202 --> 00:16:29.937
DON'T PISS DOWN MY BACK
AND TELL ME IT'S RAINING.

95
00:16:30.006 --> 00:16:33.307
WHICH SIDE IS THIS
MAN ON, SENATOR?

96
00:16:33.376 --> 00:16:35.809
EASY, TERRILL. HE BROUGHT
THEM ALL IN, DIDN'T HE?

97
00:16:35.878 --> 00:16:36.888
ALL BUT ONE.

98
00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:37.845
WHO'S THAT?

99
00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:39.980
JOSEY WALES.

100
00:16:42.152 --> 00:16:44.418
JOSEY WALES.

101
00:16:50.059 --> 00:16:51.425
CAPTAIN TERRILL,

102
00:16:51.494 --> 00:16:54.795
I WANT YOU TO CURRYCOMB
THE COUNTRYSIDE.

103
00:16:54.864 --> 00:16:56.364
YOU BEAT THE BRUSH

104
00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:58.299
AND ROOT OUT EVERYTHING DISLOYAL

105
00:16:58.368 --> 00:17:01.802
FROM A SHANGHAI
ROOSTER TO A DURHAM COW.

106
00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:05.306
NOW, WE'VE GOT TO
CLEAN UP THIS COUNTRY.

107
00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:06.874
NOW, YOU TAKE FIVE MEN

108
00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:09.810
AND GO UP THERE
AND GET JOSEY WALES.

109
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:15.416
CAPTAIN "REDLEGS"
TERRILL AND FIVE MEN

110
00:17:15.485 --> 00:17:17.918
AGAINST JOSEY WALES, EH?

111
00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:20.466
WE STOPPED THOSE BUSHWHACKERS

112
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.157
PRETTY GOOD DURING THE WAR.

113
00:17:23.226 --> 00:17:25.226
FLETCHER,

114
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:27.728
YOU GO WITH
CAPTAIN TERRILL, THEN.

115
00:17:27.797 --> 00:17:31.532
BRING IN THIS DAMN
INSURRECTIONIST REBEL.

116
00:17:31.601 --> 00:17:33.701
NOW, HERE.

117
00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:36.103
HERE'S THE MONEY FOR
BRINGING DOWN THE OTHERS.

118
00:17:36.172 --> 00:17:39.207
AND THERE'LL BE
MORE FOR JOSEY WALES.

119
00:17:45.348 --> 00:17:47.981
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF
YOUR MONEY, SENATOR.

120
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.117
LET WALES BE.

121
00:17:50.186 --> 00:17:52.453
LET ME BE.

122
00:17:52.522 --> 00:17:54.822
I'M FINISHED WITH YOU.

123
00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:07.935
ALL RIGHT,

124
00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:12.773
I WANT YOU MEN TO
RAISE YOUR RIGHT HANDS.

125
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.841
WHAT FOR?

126
00:18:13.876 --> 00:18:17.077
SO AS YOU CAN PLEDGE
LOYALTY TO THE UNION.

127
00:18:17.146 --> 00:18:18.879
HELL.

128
00:18:18.948 --> 00:18:21.081
PLEDGE LOYALTY TO THE UNION.

129
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.485
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE US
TURN AROUND AND BEND OVER.

130
00:18:25.554 --> 00:18:29.656
RAISE YOUR RIGHT HANDS
SO I CAN TAKE YOUR OATH.

131
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:32.293
"I PLEDGE

132
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:33.760
"THAT I WILL BE LOYAL

133
00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:36.430
TO THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA."

134
00:18:36.498 --> 00:18:39.433
I PLEDGE THAT I WILL BE LOYAL

135
00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:42.036
TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

136
00:18:42.939 --> 00:18:44.571
"THAT I WILL," UH...

137
00:18:45.507 --> 00:18:46.673
LET'S SEE...

138
00:18:46.742 --> 00:18:48.943
"I WILL ABIDE BY ITS LAW,

139
00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:51.946
THAT I WILL NEVER
BEAR ARMS AGAINST IT."

140
00:18:52.014 --> 00:18:53.992
THAT I WILL ABIDE BY ITS LAW,

141
00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:57.117
THAT I WILL NEVER
BEAR ARMS AGAINST IT.

142
00:18:59.021 --> 00:19:00.520
"AND RECOGNIZE..."

143
00:19:01.457 --> 00:19:03.424
"THAT IT IS ONE NATION."

144
00:19:03.492 --> 00:19:07.428
AND RECOGNIZE
THAT IT IS ONE NATION.

145
00:19:07.496 --> 00:19:08.628
I AIN'T DOING IT.

146
00:19:08.697 --> 00:19:11.265
COME ON, KID. LET'S GET
THIS OVER WITH, DAMN IT.

147
00:19:11.334 --> 00:19:13.000
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

148
00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:16.803
I THINK IT'S THEM WHO
OWES AN APOLOGY.

149
00:19:16.872 --> 00:19:19.506
"AND I FURTHER SWEAR

150
00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.442
THAT THOUGH I BE MURDEROUS..."

151
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.521
AND I FURTHER SWEAR...

152
00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:25.879
LOOK! THAT'S JOSEY.

153
00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:33.920
"VERMINOUS, LYING,
MISSOURI SCUM!"

154
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.586
WHOA!

155
00:20:06.522 --> 00:20:08.021
DAMN YOU, SENATOR.

156
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.490
YOU PROMISED ME

157
00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:12.025
THOSE MEN WOULD
BE DECENTLY TREATED.

158
00:20:12.094 --> 00:20:14.628
THEY WERE DECENTLY TREATED.

159
00:20:14.697 --> 00:20:16.497
THEY WERE DECENTLY FED,

160
00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:19.299
AND THEN THEY
WERE DECENTLY SHOT.

161
00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:22.603
THESE MEN ARE COMMON
OUTLAWS, NOTHING MORE.

162
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.934
RUN FOR IT,
FLETCHER! IT'S A TRAP!

163
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:30.438
OHH!

164
00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:46.253
JOSEY, WE BEST BE ON OUR WAY.

165
00:21:46.322 --> 00:21:47.755
GET MOVING, BOY!

166
00:21:47.824 --> 00:21:50.658
THEY'LL BE COMING AFTER US.
WE GOT TO TAKE TO THAT BRUSH!

167
00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:51.659
YOU GET GOING!

168
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:52.993
YOU CAN'T GET THEM ALL, JOSEY.

169
00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.262
THAT'S A FACT.

170
00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:55.863
HOW COME YOU'RE
DOING THIS, THEN?

171
00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:59.377
'CAUSE I'VE GOT
NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

172
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:02.937
FLETCHER WAS IN WITH
THEM. IT WAS A TRAP!

173
00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:04.505
FLETCHER?

174
00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:07.107
NEVER WOULD'VE FIGURED THAT.

175
00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:15.148
YOU DUMB KID.

176
00:22:15.217 --> 00:22:18.652
JOSEY, I GOT TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

177
00:22:19.555 --> 00:22:21.188
I'M SCARED OF DYING, JOSEY!

178
00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:23.156
MOVE OUT!

179
00:22:54.991 --> 00:22:57.324
YOU'RE GOING
AFTER HIM AFTER ALL.

180
00:22:57.393 --> 00:23:00.861
FLETCHER, I'M GIVING
YOU A COMMISSION.

181
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.832
HOUND THIS WALES
TO KINGDOM COME.

182
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:08.502
HOUND HIM, SENATOR?

183
00:23:08.571 --> 00:23:11.505

00:43:25.486 --> 00:43:28.153
BLUEBELLIES WILL GIVE YOU A...

542
00:43:28.223 --> 00:43:30.823
BETTER BURIAL THAN I CAN, BOY.

543
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.933
HALT!

544
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:42.435
WHAT'S GOING ON?

545
00:43:42.503 --> 00:43:44.743
COME ON. GET HIM!

546
00:45:16.865 --> 00:45:18.330
HOWDY.

547
00:45:19.266 --> 00:45:20.500
HOWDY.

548
00:45:20.568 --> 00:45:23.335
NAME'S JOSEY WALES.

549
00:45:23.404 --> 00:45:26.305
I'VE HEARD OF THAT NAME.

550
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:30.142
SOME SAID YOU'D
BE HEADED THIS WAY,

551
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:34.279
AND THEY SAID A
MAN COULD GET RICH

552
00:45:34.348 --> 00:45:38.083
ON REWARD MONEY
IF HE WOULD KILL YOU.

553
00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:42.154
SEEMS LIKE YOU WAS LOOKIN'
TO GAIN SOME MONEY HERE.

554
00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:46.492
ACTUALLY, I WAS
LOOKING TO GAIN AN EDGE.

555
00:45:46.561 --> 00:45:48.038
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE SOMEONE

556
00:45:48.062 --> 00:45:50.696
WHO'D SNEAK UP
BEHIND ME WITH A GUN.

557
00:45:50.765 --> 00:45:53.699
WHERE'D YOU EVER
GET AN IDEA LIKE THAT?

558
00:45:53.768 --> 00:45:55.334
BESIDES, IT AIN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE EASY

559
00:45:55.403 --> 00:45:56.936
TO SNEAK UP BEHIND AN INDIAN.

560
00:45:57.872 --> 00:46:00.573
I'M AN INDIAN, ALL RIGHT,

561
00:46:00.642 --> 00:46:02.575
BUT HERE IN THE NATION,

562
00:46:02.644 --> 00:46:05.611
THEY CALL US THE
CIVILIZED TRIBE.

563
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.112
THEY CALL US CIVILIZED

564
00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:10.516
BECAUSE WE'RE
EASY TO SNEAK UP ON.

565
00:46:10.585 --> 00:46:14.186
WHITE MEN HAVE BEEN
SNEAKING UP ON US

566
00:46:14.255 --> 00:46:16.455
FOR YEARS.

567
00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:18.591
CHEROKEE, HUH?

568
00:46:20.094 --> 00:46:21.126
YEAH.

569
00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:22.728
THEY SNEAKED UP ON US,

570
00:46:22.797 --> 00:46:26.365
AND THEY TOLD US WE
WOULDN'T BE HAPPY HERE.

571
00:46:26.434 --> 00:46:30.570
THEY SAID WE'D BE
HAPPIER IN THE NATIONS.

572
00:46:30.638 --> 00:46:33.906
SO THEY TOOK AWAY OUR LAND...

573
00:46:33.975 --> 00:46:35.775
AND SENT US HERE.

574
00:46:37.645 --> 00:46:40.112
I HAVE A FINE WOMAN...

575
00:46:41.115 --> 00:46:42.582
AND TWO SONS,

576
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:46.619
BUT THEY ALL DIED
ON THE TRAIL OF TEARS.

577
00:46:48.923 --> 00:46:50.022
AND NOW,

578
00:46:50.091 --> 00:46:53.993
THE WHITE MAN IS
SNEAKING UP ON ME...

579
00:46:55.396 --> 00:46:56.896
AGAIN.

580
00:47:03.037 --> 00:47:05.771
SEEMS LIKE WE CAN'T
TRUST THE WHITE MAN.

581
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.873
YOU BET WE CAN'T.

582
00:47:10.377 --> 00:47:14.580
I WORE THIS, UH... FROCK COAT

583
00:47:14.649 --> 00:47:17.650
IN WASHINGTON, BEFORE THE WAR.

584
00:47:17.719 --> 00:47:20.019
WE WORE THEM

585
00:47:20.088 --> 00:47:23.889
BECAUSE WE BELONGED
TO THE 5 CIVILIZED TRIBES.

586
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.495
WE DRESSED OURSELF
UP LIKE ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

587
00:47:32.033 --> 00:47:34.299
YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO SEE

588
00:47:34.368 --> 00:47:38.738
THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

589
00:47:38.806 --> 00:47:41.173
AND HE SAID...

590
00:47:41.242 --> 00:47:45.410
"BOY, YOU BOYS
SURE LOOK CIVILIZED."

591
00:47:45.479 --> 00:47:47.747
HE CONGRATULATED US,

592
00:47:47.815 --> 00:47:49.715
AND HE GAVE US MEDALS

593
00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:52.217
FOR LOOKING SO CIVILIZED.

594
00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:53.653
WE TOLD HIM

595
00:47:53.721 --> 00:47:56.455
ABOUT HOW OUR
LAND HAD BEEN STOLEN

596
00:47:56.524 --> 00:47:59.491
AND OUR PEOPLE WERE DYING.

597
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.393
WHEN WE FINISHED,

598
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:03.162
HE SHOOK OUR HANDS

599
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.197
AND SAID,

600
00:48:05.266 --> 00:48:08.968
"ENDEAVOR TO PERSEVERE."

601
00:48:09.037 --> 00:48:11.003
THEY STOOD US IN A LINE...

602
00:48:11.072 --> 00:48:14.373
JOHN JUMPER, CHILI McINTOSH,

603
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:16.642
BUFFALO HUMP,

604
00:48:16.711 --> 00:48:20.579
AND, UH, JIM POCKMARK, AND ME.

605
00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:22.247
I'M LONE WATIE.

606
00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:24.750
THEY TOOK OUR PICTURES,

607
00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:27.720
AND THE NEWSPAPER SAID,

608
00:48:27.789 --> 00:48:32.658
"INDIANS VOW TO
ENDEAVOR TO PERSEVERE."

609
00:48:32.727 --> 00:48:35.861
WE THOUGHT ABOUT
IT FOR A LONG TIME.

610
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.931
ENDEAVOR TO PERSEVERE.

611
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.468
AND WHEN WE HAD THOUGHT
ABOUT IT LONG ENOUGH,

612
00:48:43.537 --> 00:48:46.238
WE DECLARED WAR ON THE UNION.

613
00:49:00.254 --> 00:49:01.254
SERGEANT SAID

614
00:49:01.321 --> 00:49:03.756
THIS KID TRIED TO RIDE
THROUGH THEIR CAMP.

615
00:49:03.824 --> 00:49:06.058
THEY GOT HIM.

616
00:49:06.127 --> 00:49:07.492
THEY DID, DID THEY?

617
00:49:07.561 --> 00:49:08.627
MM-HMM.

618
00:49:08.695 --> 00:49:11.596
THEY'VE HAD MEN ON
GUARD HERE NIGHT AND DAY.

619
00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:13.110
NO WAY WALES COULD'VE
GOTTEN THROUGH

620
00:49:13.134 --> 00:49:14.233
TO THE NATIONS.

621
00:49:18.639 --> 00:49:21.573
WHERE THE HELL ARE
YOU GOING, FLETCHER?

622
00:49:21.642 --> 00:49:24.076
I'M HEADING INTO
THE INDIAN NATIONS.

623
00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:26.879
WHY DON'T YOU
STAY HERE, REDLEGS?

624
00:49:26.947 --> 00:49:30.582
WALES MAY BE BACK
IN A YEAR OR TWO.

625
00:49:32.653 --> 00:49:34.552
WHEN WE GET TO THE NATIONS,

626
00:49:34.621 --> 00:49:36.454
I WANT YOU MEN TO FAN OUT.

627
00:49:36.523 --> 00:49:39.424
$5,000 TO THE ONE WHO GETS HIM.

628
00:49:58.846 --> 00:50:02.414
A HORNED TOAD CAN TELL
YOU WHICH WAY TO GO.

629
00:50:02.482 --> 00:50:07.252
I USED TO KNOW THESE
THINGS WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

630
00:50:07.321 --> 00:50:08.531
BUT WHEN I GOT CIVILIZED,

631
00:50:08.555 --> 00:50:10.300
I FORGOT ALL THESE THINGS.

632
00:50:10.324 --> 00:50:12.590
I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO.

633
00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:16.328
THE HORNED TOAD SAYS
WE SHOULD GO TO MEXICO.

634
00:50:23.137 --> 00:50:26.771
WELL, LONE WATIE...

635
00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:29.186
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HORNED TOAD

636
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.276
DOWN MEXICO WAY.

637
00:50:31.345 --> 00:50:34.512
I'VE GOT SOME UNFINISHED
BUSINESS IN MISSOURI.

638
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:37.749
I HEARD, UH, GENERAL JOE SHELBY

639
00:50:37.818 --> 00:50:40.752
AND SOME MEN
REFUSED TO SURRENDER.

640
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:42.754
THEY'RE GOING DOWN TO MEXICO.

641
00:50:42.823 --> 00:50:44.656
I THINK I'LL JOIN THEM.

642
00:50:44.725 --> 00:50:46.591
SHELBY, HUH?

643
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.005
I DIDN'T KNOW OTHERS
HADN'T SURRENDERED.

644
00:50:49.029 --> 00:50:51.029
I DIDN'T SURRENDER NEITHER,

645
00:50:51.098 --> 00:50:53.365
BUT, UH, THEY TOOK MY HORSE

646
00:50:53.433 --> 00:50:54.833
AND MADE HIM SURRENDER.

647
00:50:54.902 --> 00:50:58.770
THEY HAVE HIM PULLING A
WAGON UP IN KANSAS, I'LL BET.

648
00:51:01.175 --> 00:51:03.308
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT A HORSE,

649
00:51:03.377 --> 00:51:06.245
WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON
DOING, WALKING TO MEXICO?

650
00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:07.858
NO. THERE'S A TRADING POST

651
00:51:07.882 --> 00:51:09.359
RIGHT NEAR THE CREEK NATION.

652
00:51:09.383 --> 00:51:11.716
THEY GOT HORSES TO TRADE.

653
00:51:12.753 --> 00:51:14.853
YOU HAVE ANY FOOD HERE?

654
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:19.591
ALL I HAVE IS A PIECE
OF HARD ROCK CANDY.

655
00:51:19.659 --> 00:51:22.995
BUT IT'S NOT FOR EATING.

656
00:51:23.063 --> 00:51:25.297
IT'S JUST FOR LOOKING THROUGH.

657
00:51:28.369 --> 00:51:29.801
ALL RIGHTY.

658
00:51:33.908 --> 00:51:35.840
I'LL GET YOU A HORSE.

659
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.877
WHAT THE HELL YOU GOT THERE?

660
00:52:00.901 --> 00:52:01.934
MUSKRAT.

661
00:52:02.002 --> 00:52:05.437
MUSKRAT? WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

662
00:52:05.505 --> 00:52:06.905
MUSKRAT?

663
00:52:06.974 --> 00:52:08.373
NO. NO, SIR.

664
00:52:08.442 --> 00:52:10.875
YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING MORE.

665
00:52:10.945 --> 00:52:11.876
BEAVER?

666
00:52:11.946 --> 00:52:13.445
BEAVER AIN'T NO GOOD NO MORE.

667
00:52:13.513 --> 00:52:15.613
GIVE ME 10 MUSKRAT...

668
00:52:15.682 --> 00:52:18.417
AND 30 BEAVER PELTS,

669
00:52:18.485 --> 00:52:21.219
I'LL GIVE YOU RED CLOTH.

670
00:52:21.288 --> 00:52:24.423
THAT'S A VERY GOOD
BARGAIN FOR YOU.

671
00:52:27.494 --> 00:52:28.893
HERE.

672
00:52:28.963 --> 00:52:32.530
YOU GO HAVE A DRINK
AND THINK ABOUT IT.

673
00:52:39.173 --> 00:52:40.173
SPILLING!

674
00:52:40.207 --> 00:52:41.539
OH...

675
00:52:50.284 --> 00:52:53.385
YOU BRING SOME
DRINK INSIDE, YOU HEAR?

676
00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:03.728
I TELL YA,

677
00:53:03.797 --> 00:53:04.896
THIS JERKY...

678
00:53:04.965 --> 00:53:07.232
PUT IT ON OUR BILL.

679
00:53:07.301 --> 00:53:09.234
WHAT ABOUT THESE COUGAR PELTS?

680
00:53:09.303 --> 00:53:12.404
GOING TO PUT THEM
ON OUR BILL, TOO?

681
00:53:16.143 --> 00:53:19.044
THIS IS WHAT YOU
GIVE THOSE INDIANS.

682
00:53:19.113 --> 00:53:21.246
WHERE'S THE REAL STUFF?

683
00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:39.731
WHAT'LL YOU TAKE FOR THE SQUAW?

684
00:53:39.799 --> 00:53:42.501
SHE AIN'T FOR SALE.

685
00:53:43.803 --> 00:53:46.304
I MEAN, SHE AIN'T MINE.

686
00:53:46.373 --> 00:53:48.606
SHE WORKS HERE.

687
00:53:51.412 --> 00:53:53.378
SEE THAT NOSE SCAR?

688
00:53:53.447 --> 00:53:55.347
HUH?

689
00:53:55.416 --> 00:53:57.982
KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS TO A CHEYENNE?

690
00:53:58.052 --> 00:53:59.817
ONE TOO MANY BUCKS.

691
00:53:59.886 --> 00:54:02.887
LITTLE SQUAW LIKES
HER BUCKS, HUH?

692
00:54:02.956 --> 00:54:06.324
ZUKIE, YOU PUT HER
ON THE BILL, TOO.

693
00:54:37.424 --> 00:54:40.392
I'LL BE LOOKING FOR A HORSE.

694
00:54:40.461 --> 00:54:42.127
A HORSE?

695
00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:45.197
UH, THE HORSES BELONG
TO THESE GENTLEMEN.

696
00:54:45.265 --> 00:54:48.200
MORE THAN LIKELY, THAT IS,

697
00:54:48.268 --> 00:54:51.203
I'M SURE THEY'D SELL YOU ONE.

698
00:54:58.312 --> 00:55:00.579
UH, LOOK, I GOT SOME BEER.

699
00:55:00.647 --> 00:55:02.847
SOME GOOD-BREWED CHOCK.

700
00:55:04.318 --> 00:55:06.118
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

701
00:55:22.002 --> 00:55:23.935
DO YOU SUPPOSE THESE GENTLEMEN

702
00:55:24.004 --> 00:55:25.470
WILL BE AVAILABLE

703
00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:28.573
TO DISCUSS BUSINESS AFORE LONG?

704
00:55:32.812 --> 00:55:35.913
NOW GIVE ME A
BUCKET OF THAT CHOCK.

705
00:55:44.891 --> 00:55:46.191
I GOT HIM!

706
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.960
I GOT ME JOSEY WALES.

707
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:56.168
LUKE, 5,000 GOLD
SIMOLEONS WALKED RIGHT IN.

708
00:55:56.236 --> 00:55:57.169
RIGHT TO US.

709
00:55:57.237 --> 00:55:58.503
Zukie: WAIT A MINUTE.

710
00:55:58.572 --> 00:55:59.937
HE'S IN MY PLACE.

711
00:56:00.006 --> 00:56:03.041
I RECOGNIZED HIM, TOO,

712
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:04.643
AND I'M DUE AN EVEN SPLIT.

713
00:56:07.447 --> 00:56:11.883
MR. CHAIN-BLUE
LIGHTNIN' HISSELF.

714
00:56:11.951 --> 00:56:13.552
WELL...

715
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.354
THE ONE THAT EVERYONE'S
SO SCARED ABOUT.

716
00:56:16.423 --> 00:56:17.522
YEAH.

717
00:56:17.591 --> 00:56:19.224
WELL, MR. LIGHTNIN',

718
00:56:19.293 --> 00:56:21.193
MOVE A MUSCLE,

719
00:56:21.261 --> 00:56:23.061
TWITCH YOUR FINGER,

720
00:56:23.129 --> 00:56:27.465
AND I'LL SPLATTER YOUR
GUTS ALL OVER THE WALL.

721
00:56:27.534 --> 00:56:30.034
MR. LIGHTNIN',

722
00:56:30.103 --> 00:56:33.705
WHEN I SAY MOVE,
YOU MOVE REAL SLOW,

723
00:56:33.773 --> 00:56:36.308
LIKE 'LASSES IN WINTERTIME.

724
00:56:36.376 --> 00:56:38.643
ALL RIGHT, DROP THAT HAMMER.

725
00:56:38.712 --> 00:56:42.314
NOW, JUST EASE YOUR HANDS DOWN,

726
00:56:42.382 --> 00:56:45.450
TAKE THEM GUNS
OUT, BUTT FIRST...

727
00:56:45.519 --> 00:56:48.886
SO YOU DON'T GET HOLD OF THEM.

728
00:56:48.955 --> 00:56:50.455
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

729
00:56:51.991 --> 00:56:53.825
NOD, DAMN YOU.

730
00:56:58.164 --> 00:56:59.831
NOW...

731
00:56:59.899 --> 00:57:02.967
EASE THEM PISTOLS OUT.

732
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.434
WELL, LET'S SEE...

733
00:57:36.503 --> 00:57:37.869
YOU SAY THOSE HORSES

734
00:57:37.937 --> 00:57:40.538
BELONG TO THEM
THERE PILGRIMS, HUH?

735
00:58:16.376 --> 00:58:17.742
HOWDY.

736
00:58:17.811 --> 00:58:19.277
HOWDY.

737
00:58:19.346 --> 00:58:20.712
I'M GETTING BETTER

738
00:58:20.781 --> 00:58:23.348
SNEAKING UP ON YOU LIKE THIS.

739
00:58:23.416 --> 00:58:27.352
ONLY AN INDIAN CAN
DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

740
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:29.699
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

741
00:58:29.723 --> 00:58:31.356
YOU FIGURED?

742
00:58:31.424 --> 00:58:32.824
ONLY AN INDIAN

743
00:58:32.893 --> 00:58:34.871
COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

744
00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:51.409
IT'S NOT RIGHT,

745
00:58:51.478 --> 00:58:54.012
THIS DAMN WOMAN DOING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ME.

746
00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.447
I USED TO HAVE POWER.

747
00:58:56.517 --> 00:59:00.685
NOW OLD AGE IS
CREEPING UP ON ME.

748
00:59:00.754 --> 00:59:05.891
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE
OLD HABITS THAN OLD AGE.

749
00:59:05.959 --> 00:59:07.993
WHO THE HELL IS THIS WOMAN?

750
00:59:08.061 --> 00:59:10.629
SHE WAS BACK AT
THE TRADING POST,

751
00:59:10.697 --> 00:59:12.564
GOT IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE.

752
00:59:12.633 --> 00:59:15.734
SHE'S NOT GOING
TO MEXICO WITH US.

753
00:59:15.802 --> 00:59:16.902
WITH US?

754
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:20.371
I GOT YOU A HORSE.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW.

755
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:22.206
I'VE SEEN A LOT TODAY.

756
00:59:22.275 --> 00:59:25.877
I'VE SEEN PATROLS
OF SOLDIERS ALL DAY.

757
00:59:25.946 --> 00:59:29.280
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

758
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:33.051
SHE'S NOT GOING WITH US.

759
00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:49.400
SHE SAYS SHE'S NAVAJO,

760
00:59:49.469 --> 00:59:52.403
BUT SHE WAS CAPTURED
BY THE CHEYENNE.

761
00:59:52.472 --> 00:59:53.972
SHE WAS VIOLATED

762
00:59:54.041 --> 00:59:55.985
BY ONE OF THE BUCKS
OF THE ARAPAHOS.

763
00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:59.377
THEIR SIGN IS THE
DIRTY NOSE SIGN.

764
00:59:59.446 --> 01:00:02.013
CHEYENNE CHIEF BLACK CATTLE,

765
01:00:02.082 --> 01:00:05.817
HE FIGURES SHE DID
NOT RESIST ENOUGH.

766
01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.596
HELL, OLD MAN, CAN'T
YOU GET HER TO SHUT UP?

767
01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.622
ANYWAY, SHE SAYS

768
01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:46.524
WHEN SHE COME TO
THAT TRADING POST,

769
01:00:46.593 --> 01:00:49.894
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
THIS MAN ZUKIE LIMMER

770
01:00:49.963 --> 01:00:52.130
WAS SELLING LIQUOR.

771
01:00:52.198 --> 01:00:54.198
SHE ALSO WANTS YOU TO KNOW

772
01:00:54.267 --> 01:00:57.002
THAT ALTHOUGH HE BEAT HER A LOT,

773
01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.505
NOTHING HAPPENED BETWEEN THEM.

774
01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:04.042
AND SHE SAYS YOU
ARE A GREAT WARRIOR

775
01:01:04.111 --> 01:01:07.045
AND THAT SHE SORT
OF BELONGS TO YOU

776
01:01:07.114 --> 01:01:09.413
FOR WHAT YOU DONE FOR HER.

777
01:01:09.482 --> 01:01:11.049
LOOK, YOU TELL HER

778
01:01:11.118 --> 01:01:14.452
I DON'T WANT NOBODY
BELONGING TO ME.

779
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.356
THAT MEAL WAS DAMN GOOD.

780
01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:21.325
I'M GOING TO TAKE
UP TEPEE LIVING

781
01:01:21.394 --> 01:01:23.327
IF IT'S LIKE THIS.

782
01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:25.329
YOU KNOW, SHE THINKS

783
01:01:25.398 --> 01:01:28.066
I'M SOME KIND OF
A CHEROKEE CHIEF.

784
01:01:29.036 --> 01:01:33.071
I WONDER WHERE SHE
EVER GOT THAT IDEA.

785
01:01:39.746 --> 01:01:41.513
CHIEF?

786
01:01:41.581 --> 01:01:42.980
CHIEF?

787
01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:50.788
CHIEF, I WAS JUST WONDERING,

788
01:01:50.857 --> 01:01:52.801
I SUPPOSE THAT
MANGY REDBONE HOUND

789
01:01:52.825 --> 01:01:55.693
GOT NO PLACE ELSE TO GO, EITHER.

790
01:01:59.098 --> 01:02:02.500
WELL, YOU MIGHT AS
WELL RIDE ALONG WITH US.

791
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:05.203
HELL, EVERYBODY ELSE IS.

792
01:02:28.562 --> 01:02:29.927
YAHOO!

793
01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.096
WHOO WHOO WHOO!

794
01:02:52.285 --> 01:02:54.586
HEY, YOU...

795
01:02:54.654 --> 01:02:56.921
BUY SOME INDIAN SCALPS?

796
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:05.623
NASTY HABIT, YOUNG FELLA.

797
01:04:05.692 --> 01:04:07.425
YOU BORN IN A BARN?

798
01:04:07.494 --> 01:04:10.828
Photographer: HOLD
IT... REAL STILL.

799
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.160
THE WHEAT IS FROM KANSAS,

800
01:04:23.209 --> 01:04:25.677
AND THE MOLASSES
COMES FROM MISSOURI.

801
01:04:25.745 --> 01:04:27.779
WELL, SIR, WE'LL DO
WITHOUT MOLASSES.

802
01:04:27.847 --> 01:04:30.147
ANYTHING FROM MISSOURI
HAS A TAINT ABOUT IT.

803
01:04:30.216 --> 01:04:32.227
GRANDMA, YOU GOT
TO TREAD LIGHTLY

804
01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:33.562
NOW WE'RE HERE IN TEXAS.

805
01:04:33.586 --> 01:04:34.830
LOTS OF NICE ELEMENTS
FROM MISSOURI

806
01:04:34.854 --> 01:04:36.287
COMING WEST.

807
01:04:36.356 --> 01:04:38.467
NICE THINGS FROM
MISSOURI DON'T COME WEST,

808
01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:40.725
AND TREADING
LIGHTLY IS NOT MY WAY.

809
01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:43.728
WE'RE KANSAS JAYHAWKERS
AND PROUD OF IT.

810
01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:46.397
Shopkeeper: I KNOW HOW YOU
FEEL. I'M A HOOSIER MYSELF.

811
01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:50.134
I DON'T THINK MUCH
OF HOOSIERS, NEITHER.

812
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.912
YES, FRIENDS, YES.

813
01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:05.216
THIS IS A POSITIVE
REMEDY FOR WEARINESS,

814
01:05:05.284 --> 01:05:07.418
TURGIDITY OF THE BOWELS,

815
01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:09.420
AND, UH...

816
01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:11.255
AND, UH...

817
01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:14.091
SAY, YOU'RE AN
INDIAN, AREN'T YOU?

818
01:05:16.295 --> 01:05:19.096
UH, YOU SPEAK ANY ENGLISH?

819
01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.097
WELL, SIR,

820
01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.233
THIS IS THE VERY BEST THING

821
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:24.935
FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T
HANDLE THEIR LIQUOR.

822
01:05:27.974 --> 01:05:31.242
WHAT'S IN IT?

823
01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:34.078
I... I DON'T KNOW.
VARIOUS THINGS.

824
01:05:34.146 --> 01:05:35.980
I'M ONLY THE SALESMAN.

825
01:05:37.116 --> 01:05:38.583
YOU DRINK IT.

826
01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:39.884
WHAT'S THAT?

827
01:05:41.421 --> 01:05:43.287
YOU DRINK IT.

828
01:05:49.763 --> 01:05:50.895
WELL...

829
01:05:50.963 --> 01:05:54.131
WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT
FROM A NONBELIEVER?

830
01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.367
THAT OLD LADY DON'T KNOW

831
01:05:56.436 --> 01:05:59.437
THE TROUBLE SHE CAN
GET IN TALKING LIKE THAT.

832
01:05:59.506 --> 01:06:02.440
TOO MANY FOLKS AROUND
HERE WITH THIN SKIN.

833
01:06:02.509 --> 01:06:03.441
LOTS OF SOUTHERN BOYS

834
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:05.488
BEEN GETTING INTO
TROUBLE HERE IN TEXAS.

835
01:06:05.512 --> 01:06:07.578
COLONEL BAKER
AND CAPTAIN BOB LEE

836
01:06:07.647 --> 01:06:09.947
BEEN FIGHTING OVER
IN FANNIN COUNTY.

837
01:06:10.016 --> 01:06:11.916
BILL LONGLY, REED TAYLOR,

838
01:06:11.984 --> 01:06:15.152
AND ALL THEM TAYLORS
DOWN IN GONZALEZ.

839
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.988
KILLED SIM FIXEN
OVER IN COTTON GIN.

840
01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:19.924
WEIGHTED HIM DOWN WITH LEAD.

841
01:06:19.992 --> 01:06:23.961
I GOT A PICTURE POST CARD OF IT.

842
01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:26.964
HERE. HAVE A LOOK.

843
01:06:28.367 --> 01:06:30.034
JOSEY WALES.

844
01:06:34.206 --> 01:06:35.573
WHAT SAY?

845
01:06:35.642 --> 01:06:38.342
JOSEY WALES... THEY SAY
HE'S COMING INTO TEXAS.

846
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:39.889
WON'T COME THROUGH HERE, THOUGH.

847
01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.446
KILLED 50, 60 MEN.

848
01:06:41.514 --> 01:06:43.948
REGULATORS ARE
ALL OVER THE PLACE

849
01:06:44.016 --> 01:06:46.451
LOOKING FOR HIM.

850
01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:48.453
HOW MUCH FOR ALL THIS STUFF?

851
01:06:48.521 --> 01:06:49.754
$3.00.

852
01:06:49.823 --> 01:06:52.457
I'M SURE THOSE REGULATORS
WOULD PAY PLENTY

853
01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:56.060
TO THE MAN WHO COULD
IDENTIFY JOSEY WALES.

854
01:06:56.996 --> 01:06:58.496
RECKON SO.

855
01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.708
AND HOW ABOUT YOU, SIR?

856
01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.421
JUST A FEW BOTTLES LEFT.

857
01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.125
YOU WON'T REGRET...

858
01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.387
OH, MY GOD.

859
01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.155
IT'S JOSEY WALES!

860
01:07:25.224 --> 01:07:27.124
JOSEY WALES?

861
01:07:55.221 --> 01:07:57.254
ARE YOU GOING TO
PULL THOSE PISTOLS

862
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:58.422
OR WHISTLE<i> DIXIE?</i>

863
01:08:46.005 --> 01:08:48.372
I TOLD YOU TO STAY INSIDE!

864
01:08:56.182 --> 01:08:58.950
GODDAMN INDIAN SQUAW!

865
01:09:00.853 --> 01:09:02.419
LET'S GO!

866
01:09:38.658 --> 01:09:41.959
WELCOME TO TEXAS,
MR. LONE WATIE.

867
01:09:42.028 --> 01:09:44.929
I GUESS WE AIN'T GOING TO SEE

868
01:09:44.997 --> 01:09:47.765
THAT LITTLE NAVAJO GIRL AGAIN.

869
01:09:47.834 --> 01:09:49.266
I GUESS NOT.

870
01:09:49.336 --> 01:09:51.235
I KIND OF LIKED HER,

871
01:09:51.304 --> 01:09:53.382
BUT THEN, IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT.

872
01:09:53.406 --> 01:09:54.605
LIKE WHAT?

873
01:09:54.674 --> 01:09:57.208
AFTER I GET TO LIKING SOMEONE,

874
01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.516
THEY AIN'T AROUND LONG.

875
01:09:58.578 --> 01:10:01.346
I NOTICED WHEN YOU GET
TO DISLIKING SOMEONE,

876
01:10:01.414 --> 01:10:03.815
THEY AIN'T AROUND
FOR LONG, NEITHER.

877
01:10:05.685 --> 01:10:09.821
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHICH
ONE WAS GOING TO SHOOT FIRST?

878
01:10:09.889 --> 01:10:12.022
WELL, THAT ONE IN THE CENTER,

879
01:10:12.091 --> 01:10:14.024
HE HAD A FLAP HOLSTER

880
01:10:14.093 --> 01:10:16.160
AND WAS IN NO ITCHING HURRY.

881
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:18.329
THE ONE SECOND FROM THE LEFT,

882
01:10:18.398 --> 01:10:19.831
HE HAD SCARED EYES.

883
01:10:19.899 --> 01:10:21.043
HE WASN'T GONNA DO NOTHING.

884
01:10:21.067 --> 01:10:23.167
BUT THAT ONE ON THE FAR LEFT,

885
01:10:23.236 --> 01:10:24.836
HE HAD CRAZY EYES.

886
01:10:24.904 --> 01:10:26.904
FIGURED HIM TO
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

887
01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.773
HOW ABOUT THE ONE ON THE RIGHT?

888
01:10:32.746 --> 01:10:35.480
NEVER PAID HIM NO MIND.

889
01:10:35.548 --> 01:10:37.147
YOU WERE THERE.

890
01:10:41.921 --> 01:10:44.021
I COULD HAVE MISSED.

891
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:46.391
IT WAS JOSEY WALES, ALL RIGHT.

892
01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:48.893
SAW HIM HEADING OUT OF TOWN

893
01:10:48.961 --> 01:10:50.473
WITH A RENEGADE INJUN.

894
01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:52.497
I CAN IDENTIFY HIM,

895
01:10:52.565 --> 01:10:54.499
AND I'D CERTAINLY BE GLAD

896
01:10:54.567 --> 01:10:57.902
TO SHARE IN ANY REWARD.

897
01:10:57.970 --> 01:11:00.471
KNEW HIM QUITE WELL, ACTUALLY.

898
01:11:03.242 --> 01:11:06.210
WELL, NOT A HARD MAN TO TRACK.

899
01:11:06.279 --> 01:11:09.146
LEAVES DEAD MEN
WHEREVER HE GOES.

900
01:11:09.215 --> 01:11:11.916
HE'S HEADING NORTH NOW.

901
01:11:11.984 --> 01:11:14.419
RIDING WITH A RENEGADE INDIAN.

902
01:11:14.487 --> 01:11:16.220
HE'S HEADING NORTH NOW,

903
01:11:16.289 --> 01:11:19.724
BUT HE'LL TURN SOUTHWEST,
HEAD FOR MEXICO.

904
01:11:19.793 --> 01:11:22.894
THEN WE'LL TURN SOUTHWEST
AND HEAD FOR MEXICO.

905
01:11:22.962 --> 01:11:25.530
TELL THEM TO HEAD NORTH.

906
01:11:25.598 --> 01:11:27.698
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

907
01:11:29.769 --> 01:11:32.202
LOOK AT THOSE BOYS OVER THERE...

908
01:11:32.271 --> 01:11:35.740
TIED-DOWN GUNS...

01:11:35.809 --> 01:11:37.909
BOUNTY HUNTERS.

910
01:11:37.977 --> 01:11:39.444
COME OUT OF A WAR,

911
01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:42.413
GOT NO OTHER WAY
TO MAKE A LIVING.

912
01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:43.915
EVERY LAST MOTHER'S SON

913
01:11:43.983 --> 01:11:47.585
WANTS THAT MONEY
YOU GOT ON WALES' HEAD.

914
01:11:47.654 --> 01:11:51.923
YOU AND ME DIDN'T RIDE
ALL THAT WAY FOR THAT.

915
01:11:51.991 --> 01:11:55.760
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR WALES DEAD.

916
01:11:55.829 --> 01:11:58.596
I WANT TO SEE WALES DEAD.

917
01:12:02.134 --> 01:12:04.268
WE'RE HEADING NORTH, MEN.

918
01:12:04.337 --> 01:12:05.670

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.729
COUPLE OF HORSES.

921
01:12:32.799 --> 01:12:34.865
FAR OFF. MOVING FAST.

922
01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:37.802
I DON'T HEAR NOTHING.

923
01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:42.072
GOT TO BE AN INDIAN
TO KNOW THOSE THINGS.

924
01:12:44.844 --> 01:12:46.243
YEAH.

925
01:12:46.312 --> 01:12:50.781
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE
THEM OUT IN THE SAND.

926
01:14:01.787 --> 01:14:04.188
GLAD YOU STOPPED
ME WHEN YOU DID.

927
01:14:04.257 --> 01:14:05.689
I MIGHT HAVE KILLED HER.

928
01:14:05.758 --> 01:14:07.691
OH, I NOTICED THAT.

929
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:17.751
SHE GOT SOME SUPPLIES
AND... AND OUR HORSES

930
01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.088
AND FOLLOWED US AROUND.

931
01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:24.125
SHE SAID THAT WE WAS
THE ONLY KIN SHE HAD.

932
01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:27.228
YEAH, I'LL BET WE ARE AT THAT.

933
01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:30.231
YOU KNOW, EVERY
MAN THAT I EVER KNEW

934
01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:33.067
WHO WAS GOOD
WITH A GUN AND LIVED

935
01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:35.603
ALWAYS HAD AN EDGE.

936
01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:38.906
SOME OF THEM WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE THE SUN

937
01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:39.907
BEHIND THEIR BACK.

938
01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:43.411
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA.

939
01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:49.250
YEAH. SURE PAYS TO HAVE AN EDGE.

940
01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:53.488

01:14:58.595 --> 01:14:59.693
YEP.

943
01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.363
YEP.

01:15:36.466 --> 01:15:37.398
HOWDY.

945
01:15:37.467 --> 01:15:38.566
HOWDY.

946
01:15:38.635 --> 01:15:40.668
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

947
01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:41.969
NOPE.

948
01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:44.305
I GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT.

949
01:15:44.374 --> 01:15:47.341
I AIN'T THAT OLD AFTER ALL.

950
01:15:48.278 --> 01:15:50.044
HMM.

951
01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:22.343
Lone Watie: NOT MANY
MEN WEST OF HERE.

952
01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:25.646
WE'RE GETTING INTO
COMANCHE COUNTRY.

953
01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.253
WAGON TRACKS...

954
01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:34.922
BUT I NEVER SEEN

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:40.895
<i>COMANCHEROS.</i>

958
01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:52.439
<i>COMANCHEROS...</i>

959
01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:57.311
TRADE LIQUOR AND GUNS
TO COMANCHE FOR HORSES.

960
01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.380
TRADE WOMEN, TOO.

961
01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.048

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:05.953
EIGHT... MAYBE NINE HORSES

963
01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:07.621
AND A COUPLE OF CARTS.

964
01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.837
THOSE POOR PILGRIMS FROM KANSAS.

965
01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:00.274
DON'T LOOK TOO
PROUD NOW, DO THEY?

966
01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:12.746

THEY'LL LET YOU DIE.

980
01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:35.416
KEEP WALKING.

WE'RE FACING THE SUN.

993
01:23:49.825 --> 01:23:51.858
THIS OUGHT TO GIVE HIM AN EDGE.

994
01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:53.126
OHHH...

THEN THE BEER RUN OUT.

1077
01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:22.476
WELL, NO MATTER.

1078
01:31:22.544 --> 01:31:26.312
IT'S GOOD TO SEE A HIGH
ROLLER WANDER THROUGH.

1079
01:31:39.928 --> 01:31:42.261
I DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND HIM.

1080
01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:43.842
I GUESS SOME
FELLAS JUST DON'T LIKE

1081
01:31:43.866 --> 01:31:45.743
TO BE CALLED HIGH ROLLERS.

1082
01:31:45.767 --> 01:31:47.200
I KNOWED A FELLA

1083
01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:50.770
HE DIDN'T LIKE TO BE
CALLED HIGH-HANDED.

1084
01:31:52.641 --> 01:31:55.008
WE'LL HAVE WHISKEY ALL AROUND.

1085
01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:57.043
<i>COMANCHERO</i> BRAND.

1086
01:31:57.112 --> 01:31:58.645
YEE-HOO!

1087
01:31:58.714 --> 01:32:00.113
WHOA-HO!

1088
01:32:03.418 --> 01:32:06.520
ANGELS OF MERCY
COME TO SANTA RIO!

1089
01:32:06.588 --> 01:32:08.221
THIS AIN'T SANTA RIO.

1090
01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:11.958
MY SON TOM TURNER SAID
IT WAS A THRIVING PLACE.

1091
01:32:12.027 --> 01:32:13.860
IT WAS.

1092
01:32:13.929 --> 01:32:15.239
WHEN THE SILVER RUN OUT,

1093
01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:17.343
THE THRIVIN' RUN OUT.

1094
01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.667
I DO DECLARE.

1095
01:32:20.736 --> 01:32:23.302
MIGHT YOU BE THE
MOTHER OF TOM TURNER

1096
01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:26.305
WHOSE CROOKED RIVER
RANCH IS OVER BY BLOOD BUTTE?

1097
01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.174
THAT I MIGHT, MISS.

1098
01:32:28.243 --> 01:32:33.179
WELL, I AM ROSE!

1099
01:32:33.248 --> 01:32:34.648
ROSE OF SANTA RIO!

1100
01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:37.751
I RECKON HE WROTE
YOU ALL ABOUT ME.

1101
01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:40.554
I DON'T RECOLLECT THAT.

1102
01:32:40.622 --> 01:32:42.822
AFTER HIS LUCY PASSED ON,

1103
01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:45.559
HE DIDN'T SHOW MUCH
INTEREST IN WOMEN.

1104
01:32:45.627 --> 01:32:49.228
MY SONNY BOY KEPT HIS
NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE,

1105
01:32:49.297 --> 01:32:53.033
PROVIDING A FUTURE FOR
ME AND HIS DAUGHTER THERE.

1106
01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:58.504
I DO SEEM TO RECALL
HIM TELLING ME

1107
01:32:58.574 --> 01:33:01.507
SOMETHING ABOUT A
DAUGHTER WHO WAS...

1108
01:33:01.577 --> 01:33:03.176
A LITTLE ODD.

1109
01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:06.012
HE WAS KILLED IN THE BORDER WAR

1110
01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:08.247
BY MISSOURI RUFFIANS.

1111
01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:10.216
HE DIED A PROUD MEMBER

1112
01:33:10.285 --> 01:33:12.986
OF SENATOR JIM LANE'S REDLEGS,

1113
01:33:13.055 --> 01:33:15.555
FIGHTING FOR THE JUST CAUSE.

1114
01:33:15.624 --> 01:33:17.969
OH, I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

1115
01:33:17.993 --> 01:33:21.061
HE WAS OF THE FINEST SORT.

1116
01:33:21.129 --> 01:33:23.930
SEñORA, PLEASE SIT DOWN.

1117
01:33:23.999 --> 01:33:27.100
YOU MUST BE VERY, VERY TIRED.

1118
01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:31.938
I AM DEEPLY
SORROWED TO HEAR THIS.

1119
01:33:32.007 --> 01:33:33.907
IN PAST YEARS,

1120
01:33:33.976 --> 01:33:35.875
MY FRIEND AND I WERE OF SERVICE

1121
01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.577
TO YOUR TOM TURNER.

1122
01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:40.480
AND NOW, WE ARE AT YOUR SERVICE.

1123
01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:44.952
WHY, I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN.

1124
01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:47.688
I AM GLAD TO FIND
MANNERS AT LAST

1125
01:33:47.756 --> 01:33:49.056
HERE IN THE WILDERNESS.

1126
01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:51.792
WE HAVE ENDURED
HARDSHIP OF THE WORST SORT

1127
01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:54.294
ON THE WAY OUT HERE.

1128
01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:57.798
GRANDPA SAMUEL AND UNCLE ENOCH

FELL PREY TO<i> COMANCHEROS.</i>

1130
01:34:01.236 --> 01:34:02.168
LET'S HAVE A DRINK

1131
01:34:02.237 --> 01:34:03.536
TO THE DAMN SILVER RUNNING OUT.

1132
01:34:03.606 --> 01:34:05.305
GAVE US SOME PEACE
AND QUIET AROUND HERE.

1133
01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.385
Man: THAT'S BAD LUCK,
THE SILVER RUNNING OUT.

1134
01:34:07.409 --> 01:34:10.744
I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER KIND.

1135
01:34:18.087 --> 01:34:19.987
WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?

1136
01:34:20.055 --> 01:34:23.824
I'M LOOKING FOR JOSEY WALES.

1137
01:34:26.595 --> 01:34:28.228
THAT'D BE ME.

1138
01:34:31.634 --> 01:34:33.667
YOU'RE WANTED, WALES.

1139
01:34:33.736 --> 01:34:36.236
I RECKON I'M RIGHT POPULAR.

1140
01:34:37.706 --> 01:34:39.840
YOU A BOUNTY HUNTER?

1141
01:34:39.908 --> 01:34:43.043
A MAN'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING
FOR A LIVING THESE DAYS.

1142
01:34:43.112 --> 01:34:47.180
DYING AIN'T MUCH
OF A LIVING, BOY.

1143
01:34:49.885 --> 01:34:52.585
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T NECESSARY.

1144
01:34:52.655 --> 01:34:55.989
YOU CAN JUST RIDE ON.

1145
01:35:13.241 --> 01:35:14.808
WHEW.

1146
01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.895
I HAD TO COME BACK.

1147
01:35:34.963 --> 01:35:37.530
I KNOW.

1148
01:36:19.141 --> 01:36:20.141
COMANCHE?

1149
01:36:20.175 --> 01:36:21.574
COMANCHES, ALL RIGHT.

1150
01:36:21.643 --> 01:36:23.910
ANY MORE OF THEM, YOU THINK?

1151
01:36:23.979 --> 01:36:26.279
I THINK THAT'S ALL THERE IS,

1152
01:36:26.348 --> 01:36:28.781
BUT THEY HAVE HORSES,
BUCK, AND ANTELOPE,

1153
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:31.952
SO I FIGURE THEY'RE
NOT A RAIDING PARTY.

1154
01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:34.787
BUT YOU NEVER CAN
TELL, THESE COMANCHES.

1155
01:36:34.856 --> 01:36:37.523
YOU STAY WITH THE CART.

1156
01:36:56.611 --> 01:36:59.012
JUST LOOKING US OVER, I GUESS.

1157
01:36:59.081 --> 01:37:01.348
WELL, THEY'RE PACKING HEAVY.

1158
01:37:01.416 --> 01:37:02.815
THEY MAY RETURN.

1159
01:37:02.884 --> 01:37:05.018
ALL RIGHT. LET'S MOVE OUT.

1160
01:37:11.726 --> 01:37:14.160
IF THEY RIDE WITH TEN BEARS,

1161
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:16.262
THEY WILL COME BACK.

1162
01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:20.133
TEN BEARS IS THE GREATEST
COMANCHE WAR CHIEF,

1163
01:37:20.202 --> 01:37:22.335
BUT HE'S ANGRY.

1164
01:37:22.404 --> 01:37:23.903
EACH YEAR HE'S MET

1165
01:37:23.972 --> 01:37:26.272
WITH ONE OF YOUR
BLUECOAT GENERALS.

1166
01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:28.319
AIN'T ONE OF MY GENERALS.

1167
01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:31.744
AND EACH YEAR HE IS PUSHED
FURTHER ACROSS THE PLAIN.

1168
01:37:31.813 --> 01:37:34.314
GENERAL SHERMAN HAS
COME WITH MORE PROMISES,

1169
01:37:34.383 --> 01:37:37.150
BUT TEN BEARS WILL MOVE NO MORE.

1170
01:38:30.772 --> 01:38:34.240
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!

1171
01:38:40.882 --> 01:38:44.984
ALL RIGHT. WE CAN GET
TO WORK DUSTING FIRST.

1172
01:38:45.053 --> 01:38:49.722
WE'VE GOT A NICE DUTCH
OVEN IN THE FIREPLACE.

1173
01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:50.723
MR. WALES,

1174
01:38:50.792 --> 01:38:54.394
YOU MEN CHOP SOME WOOD,

1175
01:38:54.463 --> 01:38:55.928
AND I'LL...

1176
01:38:55.997 --> 01:38:57.897
GET EVERYTHING DONE.

1177
01:38:57.966 --> 01:39:00.467
MR. WALES!

1178
01:39:00.535 --> 01:39:03.536
DID YOU COME ALL
THIS WAY TO GAWK?

1179
01:39:03.605 --> 01:39:05.037
YOU DON'T WORK,

1180
01:39:05.107 --> 01:39:07.039
YOU DON'T EAT AROUND HERE.

1181
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:10.076
DIDN'T FIGURE YOU FOR A LOAFER.

1182
01:39:34.269 --> 01:39:36.936
YOU KNOW, SHE TOLD ME

1183
01:39:37.005 --> 01:39:38.971
IT'S THE FIRST TIME

1184
01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.675
SHE EVER HAD A PLACE OF HER OWN.

1185
01:39:42.744 --> 01:39:45.411
GRANDMA SAYS IT'S OUR HOME.

1186
01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.581
IT IS ALL OF OURS.

1187
01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:50.583
I'M GLAD THERE'LL
BE A MAN AROUND

1188
01:39:50.652 --> 01:39:52.585
TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS.

1189
01:39:52.654 --> 01:39:55.921
I'LL BE DROPPING BACK
FROM TIME TO TIME,

1190
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:59.359
PROBABLY JUST TO HOLE UP.

1191
01:39:59.427 --> 01:40:02.195
WHY DON'T YOU STAY WITH US?

1192
01:40:02.264 --> 01:40:05.031
BE OUR PARTNER.

1193
01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:07.133
THEY WON'T MISS YOU.

1194
01:40:07.202 --> 01:40:09.636
MAYBE THEY'LL FORGET YOU.

1195
01:40:11.239 --> 01:40:14.507
YOU KNOW THERE
AIN'T NO FORGETTING.

1196
01:41:04.592 --> 01:41:05.991
Little Josey: PA!

1197
01:41:36.357 --> 01:41:38.023

FOR BRINGING US TO THIS PLACE.

1210
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:39.051
PA AND DANIEL DIED AT THE HANDS

1211
01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.854
OF THAT LOW-DOWN
MURDERING TRASH OUT OF HELL

1212
01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:43.389
THAT DONE THEM IN,

1213
01:42:43.458 --> 01:42:45.658
BUT THEY PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT

1214
01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:47.926
AND DIED THE BEST THEY COULD.

1215
01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:50.463
AND THANKS A LOT
FOR JOSEY WALES,

1216
01:42:50.532 --> 01:42:54.600
WHO YOU CHANGED FROM
A MURDERING BUSHWACKER

1217
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:56.602
ON THE SIDE OF SATAN

1218
01:42:56.671 --> 01:42:58.437
TO A BETTER MAN

1219
01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:01.541
TRYING TO DELIVER US
FROM THE PHILISTINES.

1220
01:43:01.609 --> 01:43:03.075
AND THANK THE LORD

1221
01:43:03.144 --> 01:43:06.345
FOR GETTING US
TOGETHER IN TEXAS.

1222
01:43:13.454 --> 01:43:14.853
HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

1223
01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:16.656
TEN BEARS...

1224
01:43:16.724 --> 01:43:18.791
HE GOT TRAVIS AND CHATO.

1225
01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:21.994
HE'LL BE RIDING
HERE IN THE MORNING.

1226
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.248
IF I WAS LOOKING FOR
A PLACE TO HOLE UP,

1227
01:43:42.317 --> 01:43:43.682
I'D PICK THIS ONE.

1228
01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:47.186
THE WALLS AND THE
CEILING 2 FEET THICK.

1229
01:43:47.255 --> 01:43:50.223
ALL MADE OF MUD,
NOTHING TO BURN.

1230
01:43:50.291 --> 01:43:52.191
TWO DOORS, FRONT AND BACK,

1231
01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:53.804
RIGHT IN SIGHT OF ONE ANOTHER.

1232
01:43:53.828 --> 01:43:55.439
THESE CROSSES ARE
TO FIRE RIFLES THROUGH.

1233
01:43:55.463 --> 01:43:57.796
UP AND DOWN, SIDE TO SIDE.

1234
01:43:57.866 --> 01:43:59.576
YOUR TOM TURNER
KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

1235
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.532
YOU BET HE DID.

1236
01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.101
I'LL BE SHOOTING
OUT OF THAT DOOR.

1237
01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:03.814
GRANNY, I'D RATHER
HAVE YOU SIT RIGHT THERE

1238
01:44:03.838 --> 01:44:04.949
WITH A BUCKET OF
POWDER, BALL, AND CAP,

1239
01:44:04.973 --> 01:44:06.072
AND DO THE LOADING.

1240
01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:07.373
CAN YOU DO THAT?

1241
01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:08.507
I CAN.

1242
01:44:09.677 --> 01:44:10.943
MOONLIGHT...

1243
01:44:11.946 --> 01:44:13.557
RIGHT UNDERNEATH THIS DOOR.

1244
01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:15.559
YOU FIRE THROUGH
HERE, ALL RIGHT?

1245
01:44:15.583 --> 01:44:17.061
LAURA LEE, RIGHT
THROUGH THIS WINDOW.

1246
01:44:17.085 --> 01:44:19.051
CAN YOU SHOOT A RIFLE?

1247
01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.152
I'LL TRY.

1248
01:44:20.221 --> 01:44:23.689
LONE, YOU TAKE THIS
WINDOW HERE AND THE DOOR,

1249
01:44:23.758 --> 01:44:25.691
WHEREVER THE MOST
FIRING'S COMING FROM.

1250
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.227
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP
AN EYE ON THAT HALLWAY THERE

1251
01:44:28.296 --> 01:44:30.662
BECAUSE...

1252
01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:33.632
THE ONLY BLIND
SPOT IS THE CEILING.

1253
01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:35.712
THEY'RE GONNA GET
AROUND TO IT EVENTUALLY.

1254
01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:37.636
THEY CAN'T SHOOT THROUGH IT,

1255
01:44:37.705 --> 01:44:40.639
BUT THEY MIGHT DIG A HOLE IN IT

1256
01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:43.175
AND DROP DOWN, MAYBE
IN THE BACK BEDROOM.

1257
01:44:43.244 --> 01:44:45.278
NOW, REMEMBER,

1258
01:44:45.346 --> 01:44:46.412
WHEN THINGS LOOK BAD

1259
01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.814
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT,

1260
01:44:48.883 --> 01:44:50.849
THEN YOU GOT TO GET MEAN.

1261
01:44:50.919 --> 01:44:53.085
I MEAN PLUMB MAD-DOG MEAN,

1262
01:44:53.154 --> 01:44:55.288
'CAUSE IF YOU LOSE
YOUR HEAD AND GIVE UP,

1263
01:44:55.356 --> 01:44:57.390
THEN YOU NEITHER LIVE NOR WIN.

1264
01:44:57.458 --> 01:44:59.458
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

1265
01:44:59.527 --> 01:45:01.527
USE PISTOLS AT SHORT RANGE.

1266
01:45:01.595 --> 01:45:03.107
MORE FIREPOWER, LESS RELOADING.

1267
01:45:03.131 --> 01:45:06.665
KEEP THIS FIRE GOING.
KEEP AN IRON ON IT RED HOT.

1268
01:45:06.734 --> 01:45:08.212
ANYBODY GETS HIT, SING OUT.

1269
01:45:08.236 --> 01:45:09.335
WE'LL SLAP IRON TO IT.

1270
01:45:09.404 --> 01:45:12.204
THAT'S THE FASTEST
WAY TO STOP THE BLOOD.

1271
01:45:14.909 --> 01:45:16.976
WHAT'S ALL THAT PAINT ABOUT?

1272
01:45:17.045 --> 01:45:18.911
IT'S MY DEATH FACE.

1273
01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:21.513
WELL, WE'RE SURE GOING TO SHOW

1274
01:45:21.582 --> 01:45:23.760
THEM REDSKINS
SOMETHING TOMORROW.

1275
01:45:23.784 --> 01:45:25.584
NO OFFENSE MEANT.

1276
01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:28.254
NONE TAKEN.

1277
01:45:38.166 --> 01:45:39.932
WHERE'S HE GOING?

1278
01:45:40.001 --> 01:45:43.902
HE KNOWS HE CAN DO THE
BEST FOR US ON A HORSE.

1279
01:45:43.972 --> 01:45:45.871
HE'S A GUERRILLA FIGHTER.

1280
01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:49.875
HE FIGURES HE CAN CARRY
THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY.

1281
01:45:49.944 --> 01:45:53.312
HE'S GOING INTO THE
VALLEY TO KILL TEN BEARS

1282
01:45:53.381 --> 01:45:56.148
AND AS MANY OF
THE MEN AS HE CAN.

1283
01:45:56.217 --> 01:45:58.528
HOW WILL HE DO THAT
AND COME BACK HERE?

1284
01:45:58.552 --> 01:46:01.487
HE WON'T COME BACK.

1285
01:46:07.061 --> 01:46:08.494
JOSEY!

1286
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:36.542
YOU BE TEN BEARS?

1287
01:48:36.611 --> 01:48:39.111
I AM TEN BEARS.

1288
01:48:43.351 --> 01:48:45.818
I'M JOSEY WALES.

1289
01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:48.788
I HAVE HEARD.

1290
01:48:49.924 --> 01:48:51.691
YOU ARE THE GRAY RIDER.

1291
01:48:51.759 --> 01:48:55.027
YOU WOULD NOT MAKE
PEACE WITH THE BLUECOATS.

1292
01:48:55.096 --> 01:48:57.129
YOU MAY GO IN PEACE.

1293
01:48:58.265 --> 01:48:59.899
I RECKON NOT.

1294
01:49:04.639 --> 01:49:06.806
I GOT NOWHERE TO GO.

1295
01:49:06.875 --> 01:49:09.141
THEN YOU WILL DIE.

1296
01:49:10.378 --> 01:49:13.345
I CAME HERE TO DIE WITH YOU...

1297
01:49:15.249 --> 01:49:16.816
OR LIVE WITH YOU.

1298
01:49:16.885 --> 01:49:20.319
DYING AIN'T SO HARD
FOR MEN LIKE YOU AND ME.

1299
01:49:20.388 --> 01:49:21.599
IT'S LIVING THAT'S HARD

1300
01:49:21.623 --> 01:49:23.990
WHEN ALL YOU'VE EVER CARED ABOUT

1301
01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:25.825
HAS BEEN BUTCHERED OR RAPED.

1302
01:49:25.894 --> 01:49:28.327
GOVERNMENTS DON'T LIVE TOGETHER.

1303
01:49:28.396 --> 01:49:30.329
PEOPLE LIVE TOGETHER.

1304
01:49:30.398 --> 01:49:32.376
WITH GOVERNMENTS
YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET

1305
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.500
A FAIR WORD OR A FAIR FIGHT.

1306
01:49:34.569 --> 01:49:36.836
I'VE COME HERE TO
GIVE YOU EITHER ONE

1307
01:49:36.905 --> 01:49:39.505
OR GET EITHER ONE FROM YOU.

1308
01:49:40.441 --> 01:49:42.474
I CAME HERE LIKE THIS

1309
01:49:42.544 --> 01:49:45.945
SO YOU'LL KNOW MY
WORD OF DEATH IS TRUE

1310
01:49:46.014 --> 01:49:48.848
AND THAT MY WORD
OF LIFE IS THEN TRUE.

1311
01:49:50.618 --> 01:49:53.318
THE BEAR LIVES HERE...

1312
01:49:53.387 --> 01:49:54.865
THE WOLF, THE ANTELOPE...

1313
01:49:54.889 --> 01:49:56.321
THE COMANCHE...

1314
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:58.290
AND SO WILL WE,

1315
01:49:58.359 --> 01:50:01.827
AND WE'LL ONLY HUNT
WHAT WE NEED TO LIVE ON,

1316
01:50:01.896 --> 01:50:03.340
SAME AS THE COMANCHE DOES.

1317
01:50:03.364 --> 01:50:05.831
AND EVERY SPRING WHEN
THE GRASS TURNS GREEN

1318
01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:07.377
AND THE COMANCHE MOVES NORTH,

1319
01:50:07.401 --> 01:50:09.835
HE CAN REST HERE IN PEACE,

1320
01:50:09.904 --> 01:50:11.381
BUTCHER SOME OF OUR CATTLE,

1321
01:50:11.405 --> 01:50:13.083
AND JERK BEEF FOR THE JOURNEY.

1322
01:50:13.107 --> 01:50:14.774
THE SIGN OF THE COMANCHE,

1323
01:50:14.842 --> 01:50:17.309
THAT WILL BE ON OUR LODGE.

1324
01:50:17.378 --> 01:50:18.878
THAT'S MY WORD OF LIFE.

1325
01:50:18.947 --> 01:50:21.146
AND YOUR WORD OF DEATH?

1326
01:50:21.215 --> 01:50:23.248
IT'S HERE IN MY PISTOLS

1327
01:50:23.317 --> 01:50:25.250
AND THERE IN YOUR RIFLES.

1328
01:50:25.319 --> 01:50:26.786
I'M HERE FOR EITHER ONE.

1329
01:50:26.854 --> 01:50:29.855
THESE THINGS YOU
SAY WE WILL HAVE,

1330
01:50:29.924 --> 01:50:31.490
WE ALREADY HAVE.

1331
01:50:31.559 --> 01:50:32.658
THAT'S TRUE.

1332
01:50:32.727 --> 01:50:35.160
I AIN'T PROMISING
YOU NOTHING EXTRA.

1333
01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:39.164
I'M JUST GIVING YOU LIFE,
AND YOU'RE GIVING ME LIFE,

1334
01:50:39.233 --> 01:50:42.167
AND I'M SAYING THAT
MEN CAN LIVE TOGETHER

1335
01:50:42.236 --> 01:50:44.076
WITHOUT BUTCHERING ONE ANOTHER.

1336
01:50:45.406 --> 01:50:46.806
IT'S SAD THAT GOVERNMENTS

1337
01:50:46.874 --> 01:50:49.308
ARE CHIEFED BY THE
DOUBLE-TONGUES.

1338
01:50:49.376 --> 01:50:52.311
THERE IS IRON IN
YOUR WORDS OF DEATH

1339
01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:54.313
FOR ALL COMANCHE TO SEE,

1340
01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:58.084
AND SO THERE IS IRON
IN YOUR WORDS OF LIFE.

1341
01:50:58.152 --> 01:51:01.186
NO SIGNED PAPER
CAN HOLD THE IRON.

1342
01:51:01.255 --> 01:51:04.657
IT MUST COME FROM MEN.

1343
01:51:04.726 --> 01:51:06.158
THE WORDS OF TEN BEARS

1344
01:51:06.227 --> 01:51:09.161
CARRY THE SAME IRON
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

1345
01:51:09.230 --> 01:51:12.665
IT IS GOOD THAT
WARRIORS SUCH AS WE MEET

1346
01:51:12.734 --> 01:51:14.667
IN THE STRUGGLE OF LIFE...

1347
01:51:14.736 --> 01:51:15.901
OR DEATH.

1348
01:51:18.172 --> 01:51:21.107
IT SHALL BE LIFE.

1349
01:51:46.267 --> 01:51:47.800
SO WILL IT BE.

1350
01:51:47.869 --> 01:51:50.369
I RECKON SO.

1351
01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:54.973
I'LL BE DAMNED. LOOK AT THIS.

1352
01:52:05.786 --> 01:52:07.186
COME. SIT DOWN.

1353
01:52:07.254 --> 01:52:10.189
OH, I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

1354
01:52:10.257 --> 01:52:11.690
I NEVER THOUGHT

1355
01:52:11.759 --> 01:52:13.759
I'D SEE YOU AGAIN, GRANDMA.

1356
01:52:13.794 --> 01:52:15.694
OH, CHATO!

1357
01:52:15.763 --> 01:52:17.395
CHATO, SIT DOWN.

1358
01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:19.076
NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE GLAD

1359
01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:21.220
TO SEE ANOTHER INDIAN.

1360
01:52:37.118 --> 01:52:39.918
HOO!

1361
01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:45.624
YOO!

1362
01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:47.592
HEY, HEY! ALL RIGHT!

1363
01:52:51.265 --> 01:52:53.598
YEE-HOO!

1364
01:53:24.832 --> 01:53:27.900
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO
SHOW YOU, MR. WALES.

1365
01:53:29.670 --> 01:53:32.104
I MADE THIS CHAIN FOR YOU.

1366
01:53:32.173 --> 01:53:34.706
I BRAIDED IT FROM MY HAIR.

1367
01:53:36.977 --> 01:53:38.443
THAT'S REAL NICE.

1368
01:53:38.512 --> 01:53:39.945
IT REALLY IS.

1369
01:53:40.014 --> 01:53:42.314
IT'S A WATCH CHAIN.

1370
01:53:42.382 --> 01:53:45.150
YEAH, WELL, IT'S A... NICE ONE.

1371
01:53:45.219 --> 01:53:46.151
IT'LL COME IN HANDY.

1372
01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:47.585
I THANK YOU FOR IT.

1373
01:53:48.856 --> 01:53:52.624
UH, YOU... YOU DO HAVE
A WATCH, DON'T YOU?

1374
01:53:55.362 --> 01:53:58.763
UH, WELL, I BEEN
MEANING TO GET ONE, YEAH.

1375
01:54:00.367 --> 01:54:04.136
COULD WE, UM, PLAY
A SONG FOR YOU?

1376
01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:10.008
I'M AFRAID I DON'T
KNOW TOO MANY SONGS.

1377
01:54:19.854 --> 01:54:21.397
COULD WE PLAY
SOMETHING YOU LIKE?

1378
01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:22.855
COME ON.

1379
01:54:22.923 --> 01:54:26.892
ONLY SONG I CAN THINK

1380
01:54:26.961 --> 01:54:29.261

AH-HA!

1402
01:55:59.486 --> 01:56:01.753
I COULD SEE HIM RIGHT
THROUGH THIS WINDOW

1403
01:56:01.822 --> 01:56:03.255
WHEN HE SHOT MY PARTNER.

1404
01:56:03.324 --> 01:56:06.258
HE WAS TRAVELING
WITH AN OLD INJUN,

1405
01:56:06.327 --> 01:56:07.725
AND A SQUAW, SOME OLD LADY,

1406
01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:09.261
AND A SCRAWNY GIRL.

1407
01:56:09.330 --> 01:56:10.795
HAD TO BE HIM.

1408
01:56:10.864 --> 01:56:13.832
HE HAD THIS SCAR ON
HIS FACE RIGHT HERE.

1409
01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:17.035
I WASN'T ABOUT TO
FACE HIM DOWN ALONE.

1410
01:56:18.005 --> 01:56:21.006
MM-HMM.

1411
01:56:21.075 --> 01:56:24.509
YOU MEN GET THEM
HORSES OUT OF SIGHT!

1412
01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:29.081
IF JOSEY WALES COMES BACK HERE,

1413
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:30.815
WE'LL BUY HIM A DRINK.

1414
01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.828
KANSAS WAS ALL...

1415
01:57:16.897 --> 01:57:17.829
GOLD.

1416
01:57:17.898 --> 01:57:20.532
IT SMELLED LIKE SUNSHINE.

1417
01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.868
YEAH.

1418
01:57:23.937 --> 01:57:25.203
WELL, I ALWAYS HEARD

1419
01:57:25.272 --> 01:57:27.739
THERE WERE THREE
KINDS OF SUNS IN KANSAS...

1420
01:57:27.807 --> 01:57:29.941
SUNSHINE...

1421
01:57:30.010 --> 01:57:32.144
SUNFLOWERS, AND...

1422
01:57:32.212 --> 01:57:34.012
SONS OF BITCHES.

1423
01:57:37.184 --> 01:57:38.616
WELL...

1424
01:57:38.685 --> 01:57:41.386
AT LEAST WE'RE
KNOWN FOR SOMETHING.

1425
01:57:44.624 --> 01:57:47.592
I HEARD A JOKE

I DON'T BELIEVE
NO FIVE<i> PISTOLEROS</i>

1522
02:11:58.611 --> 02:12:01.446
COULD DO IN JOSEY WALES.

1523
02:12:01.514 --> 02:12:03.814
MAYBE IT WAS SIX.

1524
02:12:03.883 --> 02:12:05.763

1525
02:12:06.652 --> 02:12:08.752

1526
02:12:08.821 --> 02:12:10.020
ALIVE?

1527
02:12:10.090 --> 02:12:11.522
