00:20:12.094 --> 00:20:14.628
THEY WERE DECENTLY TREATED.

188
00:20:14.697 --> 00:20:16.497
THEY WERE DECENTLY FED,

189
00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:19.299
AND THEN THEY
WERE DECENTLY SHOT.

190
00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:22.603
THESE MEN ARE COMMON
OUTLAWS, NOTHING MORE.

191
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.934
RUN FOR IT,
FLETCHER! IT'S A TRAP!

192
00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:30.438

THAT'S A FACT.

199
00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:55.863
HOW COME YOU'RE

200
00:21:57.399 --> 00:21:59.377
'CAUSE I'VE GOT
NOTHING BETTER TO DO.

201
00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:02.937
FLETCHER WAS IN WITH

202
00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:04.505
FLETCHER?

MOVE OUT!

208
00:22:54.991 --> 00:22:57.324
YOU'RE GOING
AFTER HIM AFTER ALL.

209
00:22:57.393 --> 00:23:00.861
FLETCHER, I'M GIVING
YOU A COMMISSION.

210
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:04.832
HOUND THIS WALES

00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:08.502

214
00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.343
I'VE GOT TO KILL THAT MAN.

215

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.717
AND HELL IS WHERE HE'S HEADED.

217
00:23:23.786 --> 00:23:27.354
HE'LL BE WAITING

218
00:23:32.461 --> 00:23:34.794
DON'T HOLD BACK
ACCOUNT OF ME. I CAN RIDE.

219
00:23:34.863 --> 00:23:37.264
I AIN'T HOLDING BACK

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:38.843

FIRST PLACE, IF WE

222
00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:43.803
THERE'S ENOUGH POSSES
OVER SOUTH MISSOURI

223
00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:45.772
TO START ANOTHER WAR.

224
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:49.576
AND IF WE TRY RIDING
INSTEAD OF THINKING,

225
00:23:49.645 --> 00:23:51.745
WELL, WE'LL END UP

226
00:23:51.813 --> 00:23:53.653

WHERE WE HEADED?

228
00:23:55.418 --> 00:23:57.117

00:40:42.924 --> 00:40:45.592
HELL WITH THEM FELLAS.

545
00:40:47.095 --> 00:40:49.195
BUZZARDS GOT TO EAT...

546
00:40:49.264 --> 00:40:51.264
SAME AS WORMS.

547
00:41:13.421 --> 00:41:15.521
A REAL FROG STRANGLER.

548
00:41:17.058 --> 00:41:18.524
10, 20 MORE MILES

549
00:41:18.593 --> 00:41:21.294
BEFORE WE'LL BE
SAFE IN THE NATIONS.

550
00:41:30.138 --> 00:41:33.038
THERE'S CAVALRY BETWEEN
US AND THE NATIONS.

551
00:41:33.108 --> 00:41:36.075
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
WAIT TILL THEY BED DOWN,

552
00:41:36.144 --> 00:41:38.043
THEN WALK THROUGH QUIET.

553
00:41:38.113 --> 00:41:40.045
HERE. HAVE SOME BEEF JERKY.

554
00:41:40.115 --> 00:41:42.093
DON'T SWALLOW
NOTHING BUT THE JUICE.

555
00:41:42.117 --> 00:41:44.550
I'M GOING TO GO HAVE A LOOK-SEE.

556
00:41:44.619 --> 00:41:46.085
FEEL ALL RIGHT?

557
00:41:46.154 --> 00:41:47.587
I FEEL REAL GOOD, JOSEY.

558
00:41:47.655 --> 00:41:49.054
WE GOT 'EM WHUPPED.

559
00:41:49.124 --> 00:41:50.256
[COUGHS]

560
00:41:51.892 --> 00:41:54.327
JOSEY, I WANT TO THANK YOU.

561
00:41:54.395 --> 00:41:55.539
FOR WHAT?

562
00:41:55.563 --> 00:41:57.896
SAVING MY LIFE.

563
00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:00.766
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

564
00:42:00.835 --> 00:42:03.169
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, JOSEY?

565
00:42:03.238 --> 00:42:06.139
I AIN'T SCARED NO MORE.

566
00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:12.811
ALL RIGHT.

567
00:42:40.675 --> 00:42:43.543
WE CAN START WORKING
OUR WAY THROUGH NOW, BOY.

568
00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:46.445
THE RAIN'S GIVING US AN EDG...

569
00:43:10.771 --> 00:43:13.206
THIS BOY WAS BROUGHT UP IN A...

570
00:43:13.274 --> 00:43:14.707
TIME OF BLOOD AND DYIN'

571
00:43:14.775 --> 00:43:16.353
AND NEVER
QUESTIONED A BIT OF IT.

572
00:43:16.377 --> 00:43:20.246
NEVER TURNED HIS BACK
ON HIS FOLKS OR HIS KIND.

573
00:43:22.016 --> 00:43:23.916
I RODE WITH HIM.

574
00:43:23.984 --> 00:43:25.418
I GOT NO COMPLAINTS.

575
00:43:25.486 --> 00:43:28.153
BLUEBELLIES WILL GIVE YOU A...

576
00:43:28.223 --> 00:43:30.823
BETTER BURIAL THAN I CAN, BOY.

577
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.933
HALT!

578
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:42.435
WHAT'S GOING ON?

579
00:43:42.503 --> 00:43:44.743
COME ON. GET HIM!

580
00:45:16.865 --> 00:45:18.330
HOWDY.

581
00:45:19.266 --> 00:45:20.500
HOWDY.

582
00:45:20.568 --> 00:45:23.335
NAME'S JOSEY WALES.

583
00:45:23.404 --> 00:45:26.305
I'VE HEARD OF THAT NAME.

584
00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:30.142
SOME SAID YOU'D
BE HEADED THIS WAY,

585
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:34.279
AND THEY SAID A
MAN COULD GET RICH

586
00:45:34.348 --> 00:45:38.083
ON REWARD MONEY
IF HE WOULD KILL YOU.

587
00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:42.154
SEEMS LIKE YOU WAS LOOKIN'
TO GAIN SOME MONEY HERE.

588
00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:46.492
ACTUALLY, I WAS
LOOKING TO GAIN AN EDGE.

589
00:45:46.561 --> 00:45:48.038
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE SOMEONE

590
00:45:48.062 --> 00:45:50.696
WHO'D SNEAK UP
BEHIND ME WITH A GUN.

591
00:45:50.765 --> 00:45:53.699
WHERE'D YOU EVER
GET AN IDEA LIKE THAT?

592
00:45:53.768 --> 00:45:55.334
BESIDES, IT AIN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE EASY

593
00:45:55.403 --> 00:45:56.936
TO SNEAK UP BEHIND AN INDIAN.

594
00:45:57.872 --> 00:46:00.573
I'M AN INDIAN, ALL RIGHT,

595
00:46:00.642 --> 00:46:02.575
BUT HERE IN THE NATION,

596
00:46:02.644 --> 00:46:05.611
THEY CALL US THE
CIVILIZED TRIBE.

597
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.112
THEY CALL US CIVILIZED

598
00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:10.516
BECAUSE WE'RE
EASY TO SNEAK UP ON.

599
00:46:10.585 --> 00:46:14.186
WHITE MEN HAVE BEEN
SNEAKING UP ON US

600
00:46:14.255 --> 00:46:16.455
FOR YEARS.

601
00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:18.591
CHEROKEE, HUH?

602
00:46:20.094 --> 00:46:21.126
YEAH.

603
00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:22.728
THEY SNEAKED UP ON US,

604
00:46:22.797 --> 00:46:26.365
AND THEY TOLD US WE
WOULDN'T BE HAPPY HERE.

605
00:46:26.434 --> 00:46:30.570
THEY SAID WE'D BE
HAPPIER IN THE NATIONS.

606
00:46:30.638 --> 00:46:33.906
SO THEY TOOK AWAY OUR LAND...

607
00:46:33.975 --> 00:46:35.775
AND SENT US HERE.

608
00:46:37.645 --> 00:46:40.112
I HAVE A FINE WOMAN...

609
00:46:41.115 --> 00:46:42.582
AND TWO SONS,

610
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:46.619
BUT THEY ALL DIED
ON THE TRAIL OF TEARS.

611
00:46:48.923 --> 00:46:50.022
AND NOW,

612
00:46:50.091 --> 00:46:53.993
THE WHITE MAN IS
SNEAKING UP ON ME...

613
00:46:55.396 --> 00:46:56.896
AGAIN.

614
00:47:03.037 --> 00:47:05.771
SEEMS LIKE WE CAN'T
TRUST THE WHITE MAN.

615
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.873
YOU BET WE CAN'T.

616
00:47:10.377 --> 00:47:14.580
I WORE THIS, UH... FROCK COAT

617
00:47:14.649 --> 00:47:17.650
IN WASHINGTON, BEFORE THE WAR.

618
00:47:17.719 --> 00:47:20.019
WE WORE THEM

619
00:47:20.088 --> 00:47:23.889
BECAUSE WE BELONGED
TO THE 5 CIVILIZED TRIBES.

620
00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.495
WE DRESSED OURSELF
UP LIKE ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

621
00:47:32.033 --> 00:47:34.299
YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO SEE

622
00:47:34.368 --> 00:47:38.738
THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

623
00:47:38.806 --> 00:47:41.173
AND HE SAID...

624
00:47:41.242 --> 00:47:45.410
"BOY, YOU BOYS
SURE LOOK CIVILIZED."

625
00:47:45.479 --> 00:47:47.747
HE CONGRATULATED US,

626
00:47:47.815 --> 00:47:49.715
AND HE GAVE US MEDALS

627
00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:52.217
FOR LOOKING SO CIVILIZED.

628
00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:53.653
WE TOLD HIM

629
00:47:53.721 --> 00:47:56.455
ABOUT HOW OUR
LAND HAD BEEN STOLEN

630
00:47:56.524 --> 00:47:59.491
AND OUR PEOPLE WERE DYING.

631
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.393
WHEN WE FINISHED,

632
00:48:01.462 --> 00:48:03.162
HE SHOOK OUR HANDS

633
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.197
AND SAID,

634
00:48:05.266 --> 00:48:08.968
"ENDEAVOR TO PERSEVERE."

635
00:48:09.037 --> 00:48:11.003
THEY STOOD US IN A LINE...

636
00:48:11.072 --> 00:48:14.373
JOHN JUMPER, CHILI McINTOSH,

637
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:16.642
BUFFALO HUMP,

638
00:48:16.711 --> 00:48:20.579
AND, UH, JIM POCKMARK, AND ME.

639
00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:22.247
I'M LONE WATIE.

640
00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:24.750
THEY TOOK OUR PICTURES,

641
00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:27.720
AND THE NEWSPAPER SAID,

642
00:48:27.789 --> 00:48:32.658
"INDIANS VOW TO
ENDEAVOR TO PERSEVERE."

643
00:48:32.727 --> 00:48:35.861
WE THOUGHT ABOUT
IT FOR A LONG TIME.

644
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.931
ENDEAVOR TO PERSEVERE.

645
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.468
AND WHEN WE HAD THOUGHT
ABOUT IT LONG ENOUGH,

646
00:48:43.537 --> 00:48:46.238
WE DECLARED WAR ON THE UNION.

647
00:48:46.307 --> 00:48:49.008
[SNORING]

648
00:49:00.254 --> 00:49:01.254
SERGEANT SAID

649
00:49:01.321 --> 00:49:03.756
THIS KID TRIED TO RIDE
THROUGH THEIR CAMP.

650
00:49:03.824 --> 00:49:06.058
THEY GOT HIM.

651
00:49:06.127 --> 00:49:07.492
THEY DID, DID THEY?

652
00:49:07.561 --> 00:49:08.627
MM-HMM.

653
00:49:08.695 --> 00:49:11.596
THEY'VE HAD MEN ON
GUARD HERE NIGHT AND DAY.

654
00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:13.110
NO WAY WALES COULD'VE
GOTTEN THROUGH

655
00:49:13.134 --> 00:49:14.233
TO THE NATIONS.

656
00:49:18.639 --> 00:49:21.573
WHERE THE HELL ARE
YOU GOING, FLETCHER?

657
00:49:21.642 --> 00:49:24.076
I'M HEADING INTO
THE INDIAN NATIONS.

658
00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:26.879
WHY DON'T YOU
STAY HERE, REDLEGS?

659
00:49:26.947 --> 00:49:30.582
WALES MAY BE BACK
IN A YEAR OR TWO.

660
00:49:32.653 --> 00:49:34.552
WHEN WE GET TO THE NATIONS,

661
00:49:34.621 --> 00:49:36.454
I WANT YOU MEN TO FAN OUT.

662
00:49:36.523 --> 00:49:39.424
$5,000 TO THE ONE WHO GETS HIM.

663
00:49:58.846 --> 00:50:02.414
A HORNED TOAD CAN TELL
YOU WHICH WAY TO GO.

664
00:50:02.482 --> 00:50:07.252
I USED TO KNOW THESE
THINGS WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

665
00:50:07.321 --> 00:50:08.531
BUT WHEN I GOT CIVILIZED,

666
00:50:08.555 --> 00:50:10.300
I FORGOT ALL THESE THINGS.

667
00:50:10.324 --> 00:50:12.590
I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO.

668
00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:16.328
THE HORNED TOAD SAYS
WE SHOULD GO TO MEXICO.

669
00:50:23.137 --> 00:50:26.771
WELL, LONE WATIE...

670
00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:29.186
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR HORNED TOAD

671
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:31.276
DOWN MEXICO WAY.

672
00:50:31.345 --> 00:50:34.512
I'VE GOT SOME UNFINISHED
BUSINESS IN MISSOURI.

673
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:37.749
I HEARD, UH, GENERAL JOE SHELBY

674
00:50:37.818 --> 00:50:40.752
AND SOME MEN
REFUSED TO SURRENDER.

675
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:42.754
THEY'RE GOING DOWN TO MEXICO.

676
00:50:42.823 --> 00:50:44.656
I THINK I'LL JOIN THEM.

677
00:50:44.725 --> 00:50:46.591
SHELBY, HUH?

678
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.005
I DIDN'T KNOW OTHERS
HADN'T SURRENDERED.

679
00:50:49.029 --> 00:50:51.029
I DIDN'T SURRENDER NEITHER,

680
00:50:51.098 --> 00:50:53.365
BUT, UH, THEY TOOK MY HORSE

681
00:50:53.433 --> 00:50:54.833
AND MADE HIM SURRENDER.

682
00:50:54.902 --> 00:50:58.770
THEY HAVE HIM PULLING A
WAGON UP IN KANSAS, I'LL BET.

683
00:51:01.175 --> 00:51:03.308
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT A HORSE,

684
00:51:03.377 --> 00:51:06.245
WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON
DOING, WALKING TO MEXICO?

685
00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:07.858
NO. THERE'S A TRADING POST

686
00:51:07.882 --> 00:51:09.359
RIGHT NEAR THE CREEK NATION.

687
00:51:09.383 --> 00:51:11.716
THEY GOT HORSES TO TRADE.

688
00:51:12.753 --> 00:51:14.853
YOU HAVE ANY FOOD HERE?

689
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:19.591
ALL I HAVE IS A PIECE
OF HARD ROCK CANDY.

690
00:51:19.659 --> 00:51:22.995
BUT IT'S NOT FOR EATING.

691
00:51:23.063 --> 00:51:25.297
IT'S JUST FOR LOOKING THROUGH.

692
00:51:28.369 --> 00:51:29.801
ALL RIGHTY.

693
00:51:33.908 --> 00:51:35.840
I'LL GET YOU A HORSE.

694
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.877
WHAT THE HELL YOU GOT THERE?

695
00:52:00.901 --> 00:52:01.934

696
00:52:02.002 --> 00:52:05.437
MUSKRAT? WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

697
00:52:05.505 --> 00:52:06.905
MUSKRAT?

698
00:52:06.974 --> 00:52:08.373
NO. NO, SIR.

699
00:52:08.442 --> 00:52:10.875
YOU'VE GOT TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING MORE.

700

BEAVER?

701
00:52:11.946 --> 00:52:13.445
BEAVER AIN'T NO GOOD NO MORE.

702
00:52:13.513 --> 00:52:15.613
GIVE ME 10 MUSKRAT...

703

I'LL GIVE YOU RED CLOTH.

BARGAIN FOR YOU.

1256
01:40:07.202 --> 01:40:09.636
MAYBE THEY'LL FORGET YOU.

1257
01:40:11.239 --> 01:40:14.507

AIN'T NO FORGETTING.

FOR BRINGING US TO THIS PLACE.

1272
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:39.051
PA AND DANIEL DIED AT THE HANDS

1273
01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:41.854
OF THAT LOW-DOWN
MURDERING TRASH OUT OF HELL

1274
01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:43.389
THAT DONE THEM IN,

1275
01:42:43.458 --> 01:42:45.658
BUT THEY PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT

1276
01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:47.926
AND DIED THE BEST THEY COULD.

1277
01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:50.463
AND THANKS A LOT
FOR JOSEY WALES,

1278
01:42:50.532 --> 01:42:54.600
WHO YOU CHANGED FROM
A MURDERING BUSHWACKER

1279
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:56.602
ON THE SIDE OF SATAN

1280
01:42:56.671 --> 01:42:58.437
TO A BETTER MAN

1281
01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:01.541
TRYING TO DELIVER US
FROM THE PHILISTINES.

1282
01:43:01.609 --> 01:43:03.075
AND THANK THE LORD

1283
01:43:03.144 --> 01:43:06.345
FOR GETTING US
TOGETHER IN TEXAS.

1284
01:43:13.454 --> 01:43:14.853
HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

1285
01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:16.656
TEN BEARS...

1286
01:43:16.724 --> 01:43:18.791
HE GOT TRAVIS AND CHATO.

1287
01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:21.994
HE'LL BE RIDING
HERE IN THE MORNING.

1288
01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:26.131
[SPEAKING NAVAJO]

1289
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.248
IF I WAS LOOKING FOR
A PLACE TO HOLE UP,

1290
01:43:42.317 --> 01:43:43.682
I'D PICK THIS ONE.

1291
01:43:43.751 --> 01:43:47.186
THE WALLS AND THE
CEILING 2 FEET THICK.

1292
01:43:47.255 --> 01:43:50.223
ALL MADE OF MUD,
NOTHING TO BURN.

1293
01:43:50.291 --> 01:43:52.191
TWO DOORS, FRONT AND BACK,

1294
01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:53.804
RIGHT IN SIGHT OF ONE ANOTHER.

1295
01:43:53.828 --> 01:43:55.439
THESE CROSSES ARE
TO FIRE RIFLES THROUGH.

1296
01:43:55.463 --> 01:43:57.796
UP AND DOWN, SIDE TO SIDE.

1297
01:43:57.866 --> 01:43:59.576
YOUR TOM TURNER
KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

1298
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.532
YOU BET HE DID.

1299
01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.101
I'LL BE SHOOTING
OUT OF THAT DOOR.

1300
01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:03.814
GRANNY, I'D RATHER
HAVE YOU SIT RIGHT THERE

1301
01:44:03.838 --> 01:44:04.949
WITH A BUCKET OF
POWDER, BALL, AND CAP,

1302
01:44:04.973 --> 01:44:06.072
AND DO THE LOADING.

1303
01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:07.373
CAN YOU DO THAT?

1304
01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:08.507
I CAN.

1305
01:44:09.677 --> 01:44:10.943
MOONLIGHT...

1306
01:44:11.946 --> 01:44:13.557
RIGHT UNDERNEATH THIS DOOR.

1307
01:44:13.581 --> 01:44:15.559
YOU FIRE THROUGH
HERE, ALL RIGHT?

1308
01:44:15.583 --> 01:44:17.061
LAURA LEE, RIGHT
THROUGH THIS WINDOW.

1309
01:44:17.085 --> 01:44:19.051
CAN YOU SHOOT A RIFLE?

1310
01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.152
I'LL TRY.

1311
01:44:20.221 --> 01:44:23.689
LONE, YOU TAKE THIS
WINDOW HERE AND THE DOOR,

1312
01:44:23.758 --> 01:44:25.691
WHEREVER THE MOST
FIRING'S COMING FROM.

1313
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.227
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP
AN EYE ON THAT HALLWAY THERE

1314
01:44:28.296 --> 01:44:30.662
BECAUSE...

1315
01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:33.632
THE ONLY BLIND
SPOT IS THE CEILING.

1316
01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:35.712
THEY'RE GONNA GET
AROUND TO IT EVENTUALLY.

1317
01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:37.636
THEY CAN'T SHOOT THROUGH IT,

1318
01:44:37.705 --> 01:44:40.639
BUT THEY MIGHT DIG A HOLE IN IT

1319
01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:43.175
AND DROP DOWN, MAYBE
IN THE BACK BEDROOM.

1320
01:44:43.244 --> 01:44:45.278
NOW, REMEMBER,

1321
01:44:45.346 --> 01:44:46.412
WHEN THINGS LOOK BAD

1322
01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.814
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT,

1323
01:44:48.883 --> 01:44:50.849
THEN YOU GOT TO GET MEAN.

1324
01:44:50.919 --> 01:44:53.085
I MEAN PLUMB MAD-DOG MEAN,

1325
01:44:53.154 --> 01:44:55.288
'CAUSE IF YOU LOSE
YOUR HEAD AND GIVE UP,

1326
01:44:55.356 --> 01:44:57.390
THEN YOU NEITHER LIVE NOR WIN.

1327
01:44:57.458 --> 01:44:59.458
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

1328
01:44:59.527 --> 01:45:01.527
USE PISTOLS AT SHORT RANGE.

1329
01:45:01.595 --> 01:45:03.107
MORE FIREPOWER, LESS RELOADING.

1330
01:45:03.131 --> 01:45:06.665
KEEP THIS FIRE GOING.
KEEP AN IRON ON IT RED HOT.

1331
01:45:06.734 --> 01:45:08.212
ANYBODY GETS HIT, SING OUT.

1332
01:45:08.236 --> 01:45:09.335
WE'LL SLAP IRON TO IT.

1333
01:45:09.404 --> 01:45:12.204
THAT'S THE FASTEST
WAY TO STOP THE BLOOD.

1334
01:45:14.909 --> 01:45:16.976
WHAT'S ALL THAT PAINT ABOUT?

1335
01:45:17.045 --> 01:45:18.911
IT'S MY DEATH FACE.

1336
01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:21.513
WELL, WE'RE SURE GOING TO SHOW

1337
01:45:21.582 --> 01:45:23.760
THEM REDSKINS
SOMETHING TOMORROW.

1338
01:45:23.784 --> 01:45:25.584
NO OFFENSE MEANT.

1339
01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:28.254
NONE TAKEN.

1340
01:45:38.166 --> 01:45:39.932
WHERE'S HE GOING?

1341
01:45:40.001 --> 01:45:43.902
HE KNOWS HE CAN DO THE
BEST FOR US ON A HORSE.

1342
01:45:43.972 --> 01:45:45.871
HE'S A GUERRILLA FIGHTER.

1343
01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:49.875
HE FIGURES HE CAN CARRY
THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY.

1344
01:45:49.944 --> 01:45:53.312
HE'S GOING INTO THE
VALLEY TO KILL TEN BEARS

1345
01:45:53.381 --> 01:45:56.148
AND AS MANY OF
THE MEN AS HE CAN.

1346
01:45:56.217 --> 01:45:58.528
HOW WILL HE DO THAT
AND COME BACK HERE?

1347
01:45:58.552 --> 01:46:01.487
HE WON'T COME BACK.

1348
01:46:07.061 --> 01:46:08.494
JOSEY!

1349
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:36.542
YOU BE TEN BEARS?

1350
01:48:36.611 --> 01:48:39.111
I AM TEN BEARS.

1351
01:48:43.351 --> 01:48:45.818
I'M JOSEY WALES.

1352
01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:48.788
I HAVE HEARD.

1353
01:48:49.924 --> 01:48:51.691
YOU ARE THE GRAY RIDER.

1354
01:48:51.759 --> 01:48:55.027
YOU WOULD NOT MAKE
PEACE WITH THE BLUECOATS.

1355
01:48:55.096 --> 01:48:57.129
YOU MAY GO IN PEACE.

1356
01:48:58.265 --> 01:48:59.899
I RECKON NOT.

1357
01:49:04.639 --> 01:49:06.806
I GOT NOWHERE TO GO.

1358
01:49:06.875 --> 01:49:09.141
THEN YOU WILL DIE.

1359
01:49:10.378 --> 01:49:13.345
I CAME HERE TO DIE WITH YOU...

1360
01:49:15.249 --> 01:49:16.816
OR LIVE WITH YOU.

1361
01:49:16.885 --> 01:49:20.319
DYING AIN'T SO HARD
FOR MEN LIKE YOU AND ME.

1362
01:49:20.388 --> 01:49:21.599
IT'S LIVING THAT'S HARD

1363
01:49:21.623 --> 01:49:23.990
WHEN ALL YOU'VE EVER CARED ABOUT

1364
01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:25.825
HAS BEEN BUTCHERED OR RAPED.

1365
01:49:25.894 --> 01:49:28.327
GOVERNMENTS DON'T LIVE TOGETHER.

1366
01:49:28.396 --> 01:49:30.329
PEOPLE LIVE TOGETHER.

1367
01:49:30.398 --> 01:49:32.376
WITH GOVERNMENTS
YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET

1368
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.500
A FAIR WORD OR A FAIR FIGHT.

1369
01:49:34.569 --> 01:49:36.836
I'VE COME HERE TO
GIVE YOU EITHER ONE

1370
01:49:36.905 --> 01:49:39.505
OR GET EITHER ONE FROM YOU.

1371
01:49:40.441 --> 01:49:42.474
I CAME HERE LIKE THIS

1372
01:49:42.544 --> 01:49:45.945
SO YOU'LL KNOW MY
WORD OF DEATH IS TRUE

1373
01:49:46.014 --> 01:49:48.848
AND THAT MY WORD
OF LIFE IS THEN TRUE.

1374
01:49:50.618 --> 01:49:53.318
THE BEAR LIVES HERE...

1375
01:49:53.387 --> 01:49:54.865
THE WOLF, THE ANTELOPE...

1376
01:49:54.889 --> 01:49:56.321
THE COMANCHE...

1377
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:58.290
AND SO WILL WE,

1378
01:49:58.359 --> 01:50:01.827
AND WE'LL ONLY HUNT
WHAT WE NEED TO LIVE ON,

1379
01:50:01.896 --> 01:50:03.340
SAME AS THE COMANCHE DOES.

1380
01:50:03.364 --> 01:50:05.831
AND EVERY SPRING WHEN
THE GRASS TURNS GREEN

1381
01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:07.377
AND THE COMANCHE MOVES NORTH,

1382
01:50:07.401 --> 01:50:09.835
HE CAN REST HERE IN PEACE,

1383
01:50:09.904 --> 01:50:11.381
BUTCHER SOME OF OUR CATTLE,

1384
01:50:11.405 --> 01:50:13.083
AND JERK BEEF FOR THE JOURNEY.

1385
01:50:13.107 --> 01:50:14.774
THE SIGN OF THE COMANCHE,

1386
01:50:14.842 --> 01:50:17.309
THAT WILL BE ON OUR LODGE.

1387
01:50:17.378 --> 01:50:18.878
THAT'S MY WORD OF LIFE.

1388
01:50:18.947 --> 01:50:21.146
AND YOUR WORD OF DEATH?

1389
01:50:21.215 --> 01:50:23.248
IT'S HERE IN MY PISTOLS

1390
01:50:23.317 --> 01:50:25.250
AND THERE IN YOUR RIFLES.

1391
01:50:25.319 --> 01:50:26.786
I'M HERE FOR EITHER ONE.

1392
01:50:26.854 --> 01:50:29.855
THESE THINGS YOU
SAY WE WILL HAVE,

1393
01:50:29.924 --> 01:50:31.490
WE ALREADY HAVE.

1394
01:50:31.559 --> 01:50:32.658
THAT'S TRUE.

1395
01:50:32.727 --> 01:50:35.160
I AIN'T PROMISING
YOU NOTHING EXTRA.

1396
01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:39.164
I'M JUST GIVING YOU LIFE,
AND YOU'RE GIVING ME LIFE,

1397
01:50:39.233 --> 01:50:42.167
AND I'M SAYING THAT
MEN CAN LIVE TOGETHER

1398
01:50:42.236 --> 01:50:44.076
WITHOUT BUTCHERING ONE ANOTHER.

1399
01:50:45.406 --> 01:50:46.806
IT'S SAD THAT GOVERNMENTS

1400
01:50:46.874 --> 01:50:49.308
ARE CHIEFED BY THE
DOUBLE-TONGUES.

1401
01:50:49.376 --> 01:50:52.311
THERE IS IRON IN
YOUR WORDS OF DEATH

1402
01:50:52.379 --> 01:50:54.313
FOR ALL COMANCHE TO SEE,

1403
01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:58.084
AND SO THERE IS IRON
IN YOUR WORDS OF LIFE.

1404
01:50:58.152 --> 01:51:01.186
NO SIGNED PAPER
CAN HOLD THE IRON.

1405
01:51:01.255 --> 01:51:04.657
IT MUST COME FROM MEN.

1406
01:51:04.726 --> 01:51:06.158
THE WORDS OF TEN BEARS

1407
01:51:06.227 --> 01:51:09.161
CARRY THE SAME IRON
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

1408
01:51:09.230 --> 01:51:12.665
IT IS GOOD THAT
WARRIORS SUCH AS WE MEET

1409
01:51:12.734 --> 01:51:14.667
IN THE STRUGGLE OF LIFE...

1410
01:51:14.736 --> 01:51:15.901
OR DEATH.

1411
01:51:18.172 --> 01:51:21.107
IT SHALL BE LIFE.

1412
01:51:46.267 --> 01:51:47.800
SO WILL IT BE.

1413
01:51:47.869 --> 01:51:50.369
I RECKON SO.

1414
01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:54.973
I'LL BE DAMNED. LOOK AT THIS.

1415
01:52:05.786 --> 01:52:07.186
COME. SIT DOWN.

1416
01:52:07.254 --> 01:52:10.189
OH, I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

1417
01:52:10.257 --> 01:52:11.690
I NEVER THOUGHT

1418
01:52:11.759 --> 01:52:13.759
I'D SEE YOU AGAIN, GRANDMA.

1419
01:52:13.794 --> 01:52:15.694
OH, CHATO!

1420
01:52:15.763 --> 01:52:17.395
CHATO, SIT DOWN.

1421
01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:19.076
NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE GLAD

1422
01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:21.220
TO SEE ANOTHER INDIAN.

1423
01:52:37.118 --> 01:52:39.918
HOO!

1424
01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:45.624
YOO!

1425
01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:47.592
HEY, HEY! ALL RIGHT!

1426
01:52:51.265 --> 01:52:53.598
YEE-HOO!

1427
01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:02.040
[MOO]

1428
01:53:24.832 --> 01:53:27.900
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO
SHOW YOU, MR. WALES.

1429
01:53:29.670 --> 01:53:32.104
I MADE THIS CHAIN FOR YOU.

1430
