on the next pass,

little more specific.

Today, we travel to Hawaii

151
00:08:37.047 --> 00:08:39.683
to try to separate
fact from fiction.

152
00:08:39.716 --> 00:08:41.985

Islands are filled

One island and the structure
that resides on it,

160
00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:05.842
Kilahuna Island, is home to
a once breathtaking resort

161
00:09:05.876 --> 00:09:07.911
that now sits abandoned.

162
00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:10.213
It is now closed off from
the rest of the world

163
00:09:10.247 --> 00:09:14.151
due to a series of bizarre
and inexplicable events.

164
00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:16.820
The locals consider
the land sacred

165
00:09:16.853 --> 00:09:19.890
due to the tribal battles
held there in the past,

166
00:09:19.923 --> 00:09:23.059
leaving it cursed
by the blood of war.

167
00:09:23.093 --> 00:09:24.794
Built in the early '90s,

168
00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:27.831
the resort was intended to
be a magnet for tourism.

169
00:09:27.864 --> 00:09:29.266
But shortly after opening,

170
00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:33.436
it became overwhelmed by
reports of aggressive hauntings.

171
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.740

last known video of the resort,

172
00:09:36.773 --> 00:09:39.709
including some
modern drone footage.

173
00:09:39.743 --> 00:09:43.079
We do not know who filmed
or uploaded the footage.

174
00:09:43.113 --> 00:09:45.348
One room in particular
was notorious

00:09:45.382 --> 00:09:48.685
for hosting terrifying
events, room 306.

176
00:09:50.453 --> 00:09:52.822
Guests that have had the
misfortune of staying in this room

177
00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:56.259
have reported a wide array
of paranormal activity.

178
00:09:56.293 --> 00:09:59.196

hearing voices,

179
00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:00.964
flashing lights,

180
00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:03.900
and writing on the mirror
after exiting the shower.

00:10:03.934 --> 00:10:07.470
The hotel staff began
refusing to service 306,

182
00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:11.141
leading to the hotel
closing the room altogether.

183
00:10:11.174 --> 00:10:13.276
Amongst all the
hauntings at the resort,

184
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.145
one spirit has a reputation

185
00:10:15.178 --> 00:10:17.380
that is feared more
than any other,

186
00:10:17.414 --> 00:10:20.951
a ghost the locals call
the half-face girl.

187
00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:22.786
The story goes that
the half-face girl

188
00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:24.921
was a local villager
who was attacked

189
00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:26.856
and killed on the island.

190
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.459
She was brutally strangled
to death with her jump rope

191
00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:31.494
and left for dead in the jungle,

192
00:10:31.528 --> 00:10:34.064
the animals feasting
on her corpse.

193
00:10:34.097 --> 00:10:35.532
Those responsible for the attack

194
00:10:35.565 --> 00:10:38.134
were thought to be tourists
staying at the resort,

195
00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:40.537
but no suspects
were ever charged.

196
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.272
The locals say
the half-face girl

197
00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:45.008
still roams the
island and the resort,

198
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:49.179
looking for her perpetrators
to enact an eternal justice.

199
00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:51.881
From the sightings
stem disappearances.

200
00:10:51.915 --> 00:10:54.317
The locals believe the
half-face girl had taken them

201
00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:57.954
and their souls to wander the
island with her for eternity.

202
00:10:57.988 --> 00:11:00.123
After only two
years of being open,

203
00:11:00.156 --> 00:11:01.925
the resort was
eventually shut down

204
00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.960
and closed to all visitors.

205
00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:05.829
The only known
access to the island

206
00:11:05.862 --> 00:11:08.898
is a small boat that
ferries locals once a day.

207
00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:11.034
The locals maintain
their side of the island

208
00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:14.204
and employ a small security
force to prevent trespassing

209
00:11:14.237 --> 00:11:17.340
and perhaps further
investigation into these events.

210
00:11:17.374 --> 00:11:20.277
Are the stories of Kilahuna
and the resort true?

211
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.379
With locals refusing
to help anyone

212
00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:25.148
make their way across
the island to the resort,

213
00:11:25.181 --> 00:11:28.485
the mystery may
never be put to rest.

214
00:11:28.518 --> 00:11:29.886
Oh, great.

215
00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:32.956
Now, I really want to go there.

216
00:11:32.989 --> 00:11:34.291
I'm sure it's just
the same old folklore

217
00:11:34.324 --> 00:11:35.593
as every other place.

218
00:11:35.626 --> 00:11:37.961
I mean, there are always
practical explanations,

219
00:11:37.994 --> 00:11:39.396
but not at Kilahuna.

220
00:11:40.598 --> 00:11:42.465
Dozens of unexplained
disappearances

221
00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:44.134
have occurred at that resort

222
00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:47.437
and the locals swear by the
existence of the half-face girl.

223
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.339
Yeah, well, my aunt also
thinks that you'll catch a cold

224
00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:51.374
if you leave the house
with your hair wet.

225
00:11:51.408 --> 00:11:53.243
That's because you
will catch a cold

226
00:11:53.276 --> 00:11:55.378
if you leave the house
with your hair wet.

227
00:11:55.412 --> 00:11:57.013
That's not what I meant.

228
00:11:57.047 --> 00:12:00.150
It's a superstition, right, Lex?

229
00:12:00.183 --> 00:12:02.485
There's only one
way to find out.

230
00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:06.022
We have to find
the half-face girl!

231
00:12:06.056 --> 00:12:08.124
I only got half a face.

232
00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:09.859
Take those off.

233
00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:11.895
Ew, that's the
grossest thing ever!

I'm still down to go.

235
00:12:14.497 --> 00:12:18.168
The legend of the
half-faced girl?

236
00:12:18.201 --> 00:12:21.137
I haven't heard
that one in a while.

237
00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:22.839
It's not a legend.

238
00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:26.176
Have you ever been
to that island?

239
00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:28.579
Yeah, once, when I was young.

240
00:12:29.647 --> 00:12:31.314
I remember the rumors,

241
00:12:31.348 --> 00:12:32.616
and I remember the resorts,

242
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.184
and I remember how they
closed the resort down

243
00:12:34.217 --> 00:12:36.286
because of those rumors.

244
00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:39.889
It should have never been built.

245
00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:42.292
Well, I could see how it
would make for a great book.

246
00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:47.263
I mean, heck, scared the bejesus
out of me when I was a kid.

00:18:56.566 --> 00:18:58.534
BREE: Really, strip clubs?

359
00:18:58.568 --> 00:19:00.336
I love strip clubs.

360
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:04.440
Thank you, by the way.

361
00:19:04.474 --> 00:19:05.341
For what?

362
00:19:06.577 --> 00:19:08.311
What you did.

363
00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:09.512
What did I do?

364
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.315
Bringing me here.

365
00:19:12.348 --> 00:19:14.718
It was all of our ideas.

366
00:19:14.752 --> 00:19:17.988
Yeah, but Bree
may have mentioned

367
00:19:18.021 --> 00:19:20.389
that you paid for my ticket.

368
00:19:21.692 --> 00:19:24.828
I just know how much
you like these things.

369
00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:26.764
I really appreciate it.

370
00:19:26.797 --> 00:19:28.264
You're welcome.

371
00:19:37.941 --> 00:19:41.544
I am literally
already out of breath.

372
00:19:41.578 --> 00:19:45.082
I think that's probably
the alcohol talking.

373
00:19:45.115 --> 00:19:46.549
Super original.

374
00:19:47.818 --> 00:19:49.620
You should write that
in your next book.

375
00:19:49.653 --> 00:19:50.921
If you should be so lucky

376
00:19:50.954 --> 00:19:52.956
to inspire anything
I write, Sam.

377
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.357
I know I don't want to
be anything you write

378
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.926
if it involves ghosts.

379
00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.596
Seriously, why do you believe?

380
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.033
Like you really want
to hear my explanation.

381
00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:04.534
I do seriously.

382
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.671
Okay.

383
00:20:09.372 --> 00:20:13.043
First of all, if there
isn't some other dimension,

384
00:20:13.076 --> 00:20:16.780
then how do you explain
that almost every religion

385
00:20:16.814 --> 00:20:19.082
since the origin of
the human species

386
00:20:19.116 --> 00:20:20.851
believes in the afterlife?

387
00:20:20.884 --> 00:20:22.119
And on top of that,

388
00:20:22.152 --> 00:20:24.554
they talk about some
way of communicating

389
00:20:24.588 --> 00:20:27.057
with deceased
ancestors or deities.

390
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.592
Like what about,

391
00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:30.928
what about praying and
celebrating holidays

392
00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:33.396
like Dia de los
Muertos, shamans?

393
00:20:33.429 --> 00:20:34.631
Okay, okay.

394
00:20:34.665 --> 00:20:37.100
I think that people
make up stories.

395
00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:41.738
How the earth was created,
how humans evolved,

396
00:20:41.772 --> 00:20:42.873
why we're here.

397
00:20:43.907 --> 00:20:45.609
Because those stories,

398
00:20:45.642 --> 00:20:49.079
they give people something
to believe in, right?

399
00:20:49.112 --> 00:20:51.782
Which makes people feel better.

400
00:20:51.815 --> 00:20:53.050
And most of the time,

401
00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:56.485
that translate into
them behaving better.

402
00:20:56.519 --> 00:20:58.554
The Bible, the
Quran, cave walls,

403
00:20:58.589 --> 00:21:01.158
all of these like
religious writings,

404
00:21:01.191 --> 00:21:04.595
they all promise this
beautiful afterlife

405
00:21:04.628 --> 00:21:06.864
because it makes
people feel better.

406
00:21:06.897 --> 00:21:08.799
They need something
to believe in,

407
00:21:08.832 --> 00:21:10.767
hence the stories.

408
00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:12.669
I could be wrong.

409
00:21:12.703 --> 00:21:13.536
Okay.

410
00:21:15.072 --> 00:21:19.009
So you believe that because
people need to believe,

411
00:21:20.677 --> 00:21:21.845
it all is fake?

412
00:21:23.046 --> 00:21:23.847
Yeah.

413
00:21:25.182 --> 00:21:26.750
All right.

414
00:21:26.783 --> 00:21:29.552
What about all of the
photographic evidence

415
00:21:29.586 --> 00:21:32.089
of apparitions that we have?

416
00:21:32.122 --> 00:21:32.923
Fake.

417
00:21:33.957 --> 00:21:35.125
Poltergeist occurrences

418
00:21:35.158 --> 00:21:38.161
where there are
multiple eye witnesses.

419
00:21:39.162 --> 00:21:39.997
Bullshit.

420
00:21:41.632 --> 00:21:43.634
My grandmother's spirit

421
00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:45.135
visiting me the
night that she died.

422
00:21:45.168 --> 00:21:46.637
Definitely fake.

423
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.074
Oh, you're serious?

424
00:21:51.108 --> 00:21:54.645
I know it sounds
stupid, but it happened.

425
00:21:55.979 --> 00:21:57.648
When I was younger,

426
00:21:57.681 --> 00:21:58.916
we didn't really talk to
my grandparents very much.

427
00:21:58.949 --> 00:22:02.686
And I was doing my homework
one night in my room

428
00:22:05.088 --> 00:22:06.657
and I noticed that
in the corner,

429
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.693
there she was just
sitting in the chair.

430
00:22:09.726 --> 00:22:12.095
I mean, she wasn't solid, but
I could totally make her out.

431
00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:15.564
I could see her face
and she smiled at me.

432
00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:18.168
She looked straight into my eyes

433
00:22:18.201 --> 00:22:19.603
and she didn't have
to say anything,

434
00:22:19.636 --> 00:22:23.472
but I just knew it
was gonna be okay.

435
00:22:23.506 --> 00:22:25.474
And then she was gone.

436
00:22:25.508 --> 00:22:28.912
So I told my mom and she
gave me the exact look

437
00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:30.013
that you're giving me now.

438
00:22:30.047 --> 00:22:31.014
SAM: I am listening.

439
00:22:31.048 --> 00:22:32.683
That I was crazy.

440
00:22:34.584 --> 00:22:35.819
But then the next morning,

441
00:22:35.852 --> 00:22:38.021
we got a call and
she'd passed away.

442
00:22:38.055 --> 00:22:39.856
So I looked it up, okay?

443
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.591
I looked it up

444
00:22:41.625 --> 00:22:43.126
and it turns out that
there are a lot of accounts

445
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.697
where people,
relatives, spirits,

446
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.166
visit them in between
when they leave this earth

447
00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:50.901

We landed here on the beach.

464
00:23:34.678 --> 00:23:36.046
We took this trail to there

465
00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:37.280

somewhere in there.

is not on that map,

something I never told you?

565
00:28:10.053 --> 00:28:12.889
I was really
religious growing up.

566
00:28:12.922 --> 00:28:14.357
I grew up in a Christian house.

567
00:28:14.391 --> 00:28:16.960
We went to church every Sunday.

568
00:28:16.993 --> 00:28:19.396
We did the whole thing.

569
00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:23.033
And one night, I woke
up and I couldn't move.

570
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.907
I could feel like this
presence on top of me,

571
00:28:32.409 --> 00:28:34.077
like an evil spirit.

572
00:28:35.646 --> 00:28:39.449
And it was terrifying,
so I prayed and I prayed.

573
00:28:41.284 --> 00:28:43.920
And finally, I could move again.

574
00:28:47.524 --> 00:28:49.125
I feel like there's
a but coming.

575
00:28:49.159 --> 00:28:51.361
But in college, I learned
about sleep paralysis,

576
00:28:51.394 --> 00:28:53.897
which basically is
when you're sleeping,

577
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.033
your body goes into this,
it paralyzes itself,

578
00:28:57.067 --> 00:28:59.436
so you don't go act
out your dreams.

579
00:28:59.469 --> 00:29:00.904
When that doesn't work right,

580
00:29:00.937 --> 00:29:05.208
you wake up in a dream
state feeling paralyzed.

581
00:29:05.241 --> 00:29:06.142
People feel fear.

582
00:29:06.176 --> 00:29:07.010
They hear things.

583
00:29:07.043 --> 00:29:08.244
They see things.

584
00:29:10.146 --> 00:29:11.881
So what's more likely?

585
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:16.052
Demon came into a
12 year old's room,

586
00:29:16.086 --> 00:29:17.354
gave him the people's elbow,

587
00:29:17.387 --> 00:29:19.356
held him down for
a couple minutes,

588
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:22.892
or it was a little
sleep paralysis.

589
00:29:22.926 --> 00:29:24.595
Again, I could be wrong.

590
00:29:26.296 --> 00:29:28.264
You know, you keep saying
that you could be wrong.

591
00:29:28.298 --> 00:29:30.567
Is that because
you know you are?

592
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:31.401
Ooh.

593
00:29:32.369 --> 00:29:34.404
Well, what do you believe?

594
00:29:34.437 --> 00:29:36.640
Well, I feel like
if there's a God,

595
00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:39.943
then there has to be an evil.

596
00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:43.581
And so if you believe
in like, goodness,

597
00:29:43.614 --> 00:29:45.583
then there has to be
stuff like demons,

598
00:29:45.616 --> 00:29:48.418
and spirits, and
negative things.

599
00:29:48.451 --> 00:29:50.453
