00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:11.669
Hello?

3
00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:15.538
Anybody down here?

4
00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:06.556
That's it, I quit!

5
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.991
You almost gave me
another heart attack.

6
00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:09.492
Should have seen the
look on your face.

7
00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:10.828
You're such a pussy.

8
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.528
You freaking dick.

9
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:16.399
Dude, you ever pull that...

10
00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:29.378
What the fuck was that?

11
00:02:29.412 --> 00:02:32.448
That sounds like a bunch
of fucking kids screaming.

12
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.318
Shit.

13
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.731
Dude, your breath.

14
00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:25.568
Surprise!

15
00:03:25.602 --> 00:03:26.937
You guys.

16
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.406
First, a birthday trip
to Hawaii, and now this?

17
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.541
It's too much.

18
00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:32.576
Hi, I'm extra.

19
00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.844
Nice to meet you.

20
00:03:33.877 --> 00:03:36.580
I'm regretting giving
you my spare keys.

21
00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:37.881
Sure.

22
00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:38.615
I mean, we all got a
lot of packing to do,

23
00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.450
but might as well cram this in.

24
00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:44.353
All right, come
on, birthday girl.

25
00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:45.889
Blow out your candles.

26
00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:49.660
Thank you.

27
00:04:11.447 --> 00:04:12.616
She calmed
down once we told her

28
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:14.550
that she wasn't on
the island anymore,

29
00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:16.887
that she was air
evac'd off and all.

30
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.421
Got it.

31
00:04:18.454 --> 00:04:19.823
Can I speak with her?

32
00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:21.390
She
should be fine now.

33
00:04:21.424 --> 00:04:22.391
You know the deal.

34
00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:24.595
Just let me know if
she started to lose it.

35
00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:25.461
Okay.

36
00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:29.633
I'm Detective Peterson, Maui PD.

37
00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:34.671
I'm here to figure out what
happened to you last night.

38
00:04:34.705 --> 00:04:36.106
Now, I'm to understand

39
00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.643
that you had a traumatic
experience on Kilahuna Island.

40
00:04:39.676 --> 00:04:41.745
The local found you
in disarray on a road

41
00:04:41.778 --> 00:04:43.881
wandering barely conscious.

42
00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.720
I also understand that
you're not traveling alone.

43
00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:53.056
You're here with three friends?

44
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.591
And then she goes

45
00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:57.160
maybe you'd be more comfortable
with your shirt off.

46
00:04:57.194 --> 00:05:01.031
And I was like ma'am,
with all due respect,

47
00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:03.532
that's exactly why
I became a pool boy.

48
00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:06.970
Wow.

49
00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:08.672
What is your life?

50
00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:11.708
It's like oh, oh, and
a little bit of oh...

51
00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:13.542
- Seriously, guys?
- Okay.

52
00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:15.679
Hey, I'm just living
vicariously, okay?

53
00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:16.880
God, I'm starting to feel like

54
00:05:16.914 --> 00:05:18.782
if we go on vacation
with these D-bags,

55
00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:20.884
we'll up coming
home in body bags.

56
00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:22.719
Oh, does that mean you're out?

57
00:05:22.753 --> 00:05:24.688
Because I could
call the old lady.

58
00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:27.824
Yeah, right, 'cause she's real.

59
00:05:27.858 --> 00:05:28.659
Oh!

60
00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:33.630
Guys, I literally
can't get over this.

61
00:05:33.664 --> 00:05:34.698
Ooh, I would say pinch me,

62
00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:37.968
but I don't know where
Sam's hands have been.

63
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:39.136
Oh, you know.

64
00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:41.738
That's disgusting.

65
00:05:41.772 --> 00:05:44.573
I don't want to know.

66
00:05:44.608 --> 00:05:46.475
- Good god, Sam.
- No, but you deserve this.

67
00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.477
Besides, how else are you
gonna finish your book?

68
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:50.013
Yeah.

69
00:05:50.047 --> 00:05:51.615
And Stephen King says the
devil's in the details,

70
00:05:51.648 --> 00:05:52.616
so we had to make sure
you get a lay of the land.

71
00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:54.151
You don't even read.

72
00:05:54.184 --> 00:05:55.752
This is perfect timing.

73
00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:57.220
So I just finished a draft

74
00:05:57.254 --> 00:05:58.255
and I was thinking
on the next pass,

75
00:05:58.288 --> 00:06:01.091
I want it to just be a
little more specific.

76
00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:03.260
So I know nobody can go
to the actual resort,

77
00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:07.230
but just being there in
Hawaii is gonna be really,

78
00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:11.101
why is everyone being so weird?

79
00:06:13.737 --> 00:06:15.272
Okay.

80
00:06:15.305 --> 00:06:18.976
Well, we actually have
another surprise for you.

81
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:25.048
We found someone willing
to take us to the island.

82
00:06:25.082 --> 00:06:27.084
That's impossible.

83
00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:28.719
Since the resort got shut down,

84
00:06:28.752 --> 00:06:30.754
the entire island
has been restricted.

85
00:06:30.787 --> 00:06:33.690
The locals literally
won't even say its name.

86
00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:35.558
Say its name, girl.

87
00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:37.160
Kilahuna Island!

88
00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:38.862
- Kilahuna, Kilahuna, Kilahuna.
- Pack your garlic,

89
00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:39.863
pack your holy water!

90
00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:41.798
We're going paranormal!

91
00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:45.002
I don't even know what to say.

92
00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:48.805
Police that responded
to the scene found this.

93
00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:52.009
Is this your phone?

94
00:06:58.215 --> 00:07:00.183
Ms. Sanders, if they're
in danger, I've got to...

95
00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:02.185
They're still on the island.

96
00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:03.787
Who?

97
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.821
Your friends?

98
00:07:07.924 --> 00:07:11.862
Miss Sanders, I understand this
is difficult to talk about,

99
00:07:11.895 --> 00:07:13.830
but if your friends are in
danger, we need to help...

100
00:07:13.864 --> 00:07:16.565
You can't help them.

101
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.934
I don't understand.

102
00:07:17.968 --> 00:07:19.069
They're dead.

103
00:07:20.103 --> 00:07:20.904
Dead.

104
00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:24.041
How?

105
00:07:24.074 --> 00:07:25.208
Did somebody do this to you?

106
00:07:25.242 --> 00:07:26.743
She did.

107
00:07:26.777 --> 00:07:28.345
Who is she?

108
00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:30.714
The half-face girl.

109
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.618
Oh my god!

110
00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:35.719
I'm gonna be able
to get real pictures

111
00:07:35.752 --> 00:07:37.754
for the pitch deck, you guys.

112
00:07:37.788 --> 00:07:39.222
Based on true events,

113
00:07:41.258 --> 00:07:44.161
the first people to
set foot in the resort

114
00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:46.763
since its forced shut down.

115
00:07:46.797 --> 00:07:47.898
Yes, mama!

116
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:49.132
Sell that shit!

117
00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:49.966
Pause.

118
00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:53.203
Let me get this straight.

119
00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:55.672
I know the resort is
supposedly haunted,

120
00:07:55.705 --> 00:07:58.008
but you're telling me that no
one's even been to the island?

121
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:00.610
Aw, Sam, are you scared?

122
00:08:00.644 --> 00:08:02.813
Are you afraid the
boogeyman's gonna get you?

123
00:08:02.846 --> 00:08:04.915
Boogeyman's not real.

124
00:08:04.948 --> 00:08:06.850
Yeah, but it's not the boogeyman

125
00:08:06.883 --> 00:08:08.718
that you have to be scared of.

126
00:08:08.752 --> 00:08:10.020
No?

127
00:08:10.053 --> 00:08:11.755
Like you said, the
boogeyman's not real.

128
00:08:11.788 --> 00:08:13.256
Well, what is it then?

129
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.992
Why don't you show him the
YouTube videos you sent me?

130
00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:18.295
Oh yeah, that shit's terrifying.

131
00:08:18.328 --> 00:08:20.997
Okay, let's set the mood first.

132
00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:27.037
Hello and welcome to
this week's episode

133
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.172
of Paranormal P.I.

134
00:08:35.078 --> 00:08:37.013
Today, we travel to Hawaii

135
00:08:37.047 --> 00:08:39.683
to try to separate
fact from fiction.

136
00:08:39.716 --> 00:08:41.985
Now, Hawaii is no
stranger to hauntings

137
00:08:42.018 --> 00:08:43.854
and they have a
wide ranging mythos

138
00:08:43.887 --> 00:08:46.389
for paranormal
investigators to explore.

139
00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:49.993
In this episode, we focus
on one in particular,

140
00:08:50.026 --> 00:08:54.865
the haunting of a now abandoned
resort on Kilahuna Island.

141
00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:56.833
The Hawaiian
Islands are filled

142
00:08:56.867 --> 00:08:59.102
with supernatural occurrences.

143
00:08:59.136 --> 00:09:01.872
One island and the structure
that resides on it,

144
00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:05.842
Kilahuna Island, is home to
a once breathtaking resort

145
00:09:05.876 --> 00:09:07.911
that now sits abandoned.

146
00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:10.213
It is now closed off from
the rest of the world

147
00:09:10.247 --> 00:09:14.151
due to a series of bizarre
and inexplicable events.

148
00:09:14.184 --> 00:09:16.820
The locals consider
the land sacred

149
00:09:16.853 --> 00:09:19.890
due to the tribal battles
held there in the past,

150
00:09:19.923 --> 00:09:23.059
leaving it cursed
by the blood of war.

151
00:09:23.093 --> 00:09:24.794
Built in the early '90s,

152
00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:27.831
the resort was intended to
be a magnet for tourism.

153
00:09:27.864 --> 00:09:29.266
But shortly after opening,

154
00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:33.436
it became overwhelmed by
reports of aggressive hauntings.

155
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.740
What you are seeing is the
last known video of the resort,

156
00:09:36.773 --> 00:09:39.709
including some
modern drone footage.

157
00:09:39.743 --> 00:09:43.079
We do not know who filmed
or uploaded the footage.

158
00:09:43.113 --> 00:09:45.348
One room in particular
was notorious

159
00:09:45.382 --> 00:09:48.685
for hosting terrifying
events, room 306.

160
00:09:50.453 --> 00:09:52.822
Guests that have had the
misfortune of staying in this room

161
00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:56.259
have reported a wide array
of paranormal activity.

162
00:09:56.293 --> 00:09:59.196
Some visitors experienced
hearing voices,

163
00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:00.964
flashing lights,

164
00:10:00.997 --> 00:10:03.900
and writing on the mirror
after exiting the shower.

165
00:10:03.934 --> 00:10:07.470
The hotel staff began
refusing to service 306,

166
00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:11.141
leading to the hotel
closing the room altogether.

167
00:10:11.174 --> 00:10:13.276
Amongst all the
hauntings at the resort,

168
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.145
one spirit has a reputation

169
00:10:15.178 --> 00:10:17.380
that is feared more
than any other,

170
00:10:17.414 --> 00:10:20.951
a ghost the locals call
the half-face girl.

171
00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:22.786
The story goes that
the half-face girl

172
00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:24.921
was a local villager
who was attacked

173
00:10:24.955 --> 00:10:26.856
and killed on the island.

174
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.459
She was brutally strangled
to death with her jump rope

175
00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:31.494
and left for dead in the jungle,

176
00:10:31.528 --> 00:10:34.064
the animals feasting
on her corpse.

177
00:10:34.097 --> 00:10:35.532
Those responsible for the attack

178
00:10:35.565 --> 00:10:38.134
were thought to be tourists
staying at the resort,

179
00:10:38.168 --> 00:10:40.537
but no suspects
were ever charged.

180
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.272
The locals say
the half-face girl

181
00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:45.008
still roams the
island and the resort,

182
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:49.179
looking for her perpetrators
to enact an eternal justice.

183
00:10:49.212 --> 00:10:51.881
From the sightings
stem disappearances.

184
00:10:51.915 --> 00:10:54.317
The locals believe the
half-face girl had taken them

185
00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:57.954
and their souls to wander the
island with her for eternity.

186
00:10:57.988 --> 00:11:00.123
After only two
years of being open,

187
00:11:00.156 --> 00:11:01.925
the resort was
eventually shut down

188
00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.960
and closed to all visitors.

189
00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:05.829
The only known
access to the island

190
00:11:05.862 --> 00:11:08.898
is a small boat that
ferries locals once a day.

191
00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:11.034
The locals maintain
their side of the island

192
00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:14.204
and employ a small security
force to prevent trespassing

193
00:11:14.237 --> 00:11:17.340
and perhaps further
investigation into these events.

194
00:11:17.374 --> 00:11:20.277
Are the stories of Kilahuna
and the resort true?

195
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.379
With locals refusing
to help anyone

196
00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:25.148
make their way across
the island to the resort,

197
00:11:25.181 --> 00:11:28.485
the mystery may
never be put to rest.

198
00:11:28.518 --> 00:11:29.886
Oh, great.

199
00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:32.956
Now, I really want to go there.

200
00:11:32.989 --> 00:11:34.291
I'm sure it's just
the same old folklore

201
00:11:34.324 --> 00:11:35.593
as every other place.

202
00:11:35.626 --> 00:11:37.961
I mean, there are always
practical explanations,

203
00:11:37.994 --> 00:11:39.396
but not at Kilahuna.

204
00:11:40.598 --> 00:11:42.465
Dozens of unexplained
disappearances

205
00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:44.134
have occurred at that resort

206
00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:47.437
and the locals swear by the
existence of the half-face girl.

207
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.339
Yeah, well, my aunt also
thinks that you'll catch a cold

208
00:11:49.372 --> 00:11:51.374
if you leave the house
with your hair wet.

209
00:11:51.408 --> 00:11:53.243
That's because you
will catch a cold

210
00:11:53.276 --> 00:11:55.378
if you leave the house
with your hair wet.

211
00:11:55.412 --> 00:11:57.013
That's not what I meant.

212
00:11:57.047 --> 00:12:00.150
It's a superstition, right, Lex?

213
00:12:00.183 --> 00:12:02.485
There's only one
way to find out.

214
00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:06.022
We have to find
the half-face girl!

215
00:12:06.056 --> 00:12:08.124
I only got half a face.

216
00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:09.859
Take those off.

217
00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:11.895
Ew, that's the
grossest thing ever!

218
00:12:11.928 --> 00:12:14.464
I'm still down to go.

219
00:12:14.497 --> 00:12:18.168
The legend of the
half-faced girl?

220
00:12:18.201 --> 00:12:21.137
I haven't heard
that one in a while.

221
00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:22.839
It's not a legend.

222
00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:26.176
Have you ever been
to that island?

223
00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:28.579
Yeah, once, when I was young.

224
00:12:29.647 --> 00:12:31.314
I remember the rumors,

225
00:12:31.348 --> 00:12:32.616
and I remember the resorts,

226
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.184
and I remember how they
closed the resort down

227
00:12:34.217 --> 00:12:36.286
because of those rumors.

228
00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:39.889
It should have never been built.

229
00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:42.292
Well, I could see how it
would make for a great book.

230
00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:47.263
I mean, heck, scared the bejesus
out of me when I was a kid.

231
00:12:47.297 --> 00:12:49.065
But let's focus back
on what happened to you

232
00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:51.201
once you arrived in Hawaii.

233
00:12:52.302 --> 00:12:54.204
You mind if I record it?

234
00:12:57.173 --> 00:12:57.974
Paperwork.

235
00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:01.277
It was beautiful.

236
00:13:03.413 --> 00:13:04.914
Do you guys have
room for one more?

237
00:13:04.948 --> 00:13:07.217
Let's go, girl.

238
00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:25.235
The rental car situation could
have been a little better.

239
00:13:25.268 --> 00:13:26.604
What's wrong with
the rental car?

240
00:13:26.637 --> 00:13:28.104
It's huge.

241
00:13:28.138 --> 00:13:29.506
What's wrong with huge?

242
00:13:29.539 --> 00:13:31.040
Yeah.

243
00:13:31.074 --> 00:13:32.610
I mean, it was the
last one they had.

244
00:13:32.643 --> 00:13:35.646
I get it, swimmer's body
is better than meaty,

245
00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:37.447
but you know.

246
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.149
I wanted the Jeep.

247
00:13:41.317 --> 00:13:43.486
That would have been such
a cute Instagram photo.

248
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.356
They always want more.

249
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:48.057
How far are we from the resort?

250
00:13:48.091 --> 00:13:49.693
It's close.

251
00:13:49.727 --> 00:13:52.996
We just have to
island hop first.

252
00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:54.297
Island hop?

253
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.267
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

254
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.636
Surprise.

255
00:14:00.236 --> 00:14:03.006
Nobody said anything
about a helicopter.

256
00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:05.609
That's because we knew
you'd complain about it.

257
00:14:05.643 --> 00:14:08.211
I'm just not gonna do that.

258
00:14:08.244 --> 00:14:09.512
Let's see.

259
00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:11.181
Lex, it's the only
helicopter company

260
00:14:11.214 --> 00:14:13.483
that can take us to
the other island.

261
00:14:13.516 --> 00:14:15.985
I mean, isn't there
a boat we can take?

262
00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:17.621
There's only one boat a day
and we already missed it.

263
00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:18.756
This is cheaper.

264
00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:20.390
It's gonna be fun.

265
00:14:20.423 --> 00:14:22.325
You guys ready to fly?

266
00:14:25.228 --> 00:14:26.095
Let's go!

267
00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:27.464
Okay.

268
00:14:27.497 --> 00:14:28.298
Okay.

269
00:14:33.637 --> 00:14:36.707
I think we should
have took the boat.

270
00:14:38.074 --> 00:14:40.243
Saddle up, soldiers.

271
00:14:40.276 --> 00:14:42.111
Let's go haunting, Lex!

272
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.184
Heli tower.

273
00:14:48.218 --> 00:14:49.753
Heli niner whisky hotel.

274
00:14:49.787 --> 00:14:52.388
East ramp ready to go with lima.

275
00:14:52.422 --> 00:14:54.224
Departure to the east.

276
00:14:55.525 --> 00:14:59.195
I hope this thing still
takes off.

277
00:14:59.229 --> 00:15:00.263
Just kidding.

278
00:15:22.252 --> 00:15:24.588
You are missing out, Lex!

279
00:15:24.622 --> 00:15:26.222
Open your eyes.

280
00:16:08.164 --> 00:16:09.767
So, what's the deal
with the resort?

281
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.401
Is it real?

282
00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:13.469
I heard the stories.

283
00:16:13.503 --> 00:16:15.572
So it's real?

284
00:16:15.606 --> 00:16:18.642
No, I think the
stories are bullshit.

285
00:16:18.676 --> 00:16:20.711
See, I knew I liked him.

286
00:16:24.547 --> 00:16:26.482
How many people
live on the island?

287
00:16:26.516 --> 00:16:28.852
Well, just a few
on the south side.

288
00:16:28.886 --> 00:16:30.588
Not too many on the
resort side, you know,

289
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:34.257
since they stopped
maintaining the road.

290
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.693
Have you been there?

291
00:16:35.726 --> 00:16:38.561
No, I don't care to go
to places like that.

292
00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:42.298
Then how do you know
it's not haunted?

293
00:16:42.332 --> 00:16:44.434
I never said it wasn't.

294
00:16:47.938 --> 00:16:49.773
There's a few ways to
get to this waterfall

295
00:16:49.807 --> 00:16:51.541
when you try to hike to.

296
00:16:51.574 --> 00:16:53.811
You need to stay on the trails.

297
00:16:53.844 --> 00:16:58.481
Do not go anywhere the signs
say you shouldn't go to.

298
00:16:58.514 --> 00:17:02.151
You don't want to get trapped
in a flash flood out here.

299
00:17:02.185 --> 00:17:05.756
There's no one to help and
there's no cell phone reception.

300
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:09.392
Now, there's one boat
that leaves tonight

301
00:17:09.425 --> 00:17:11.160
if you want to get
off this island,

302
00:17:11.194 --> 00:17:13.196
and that happens at 7:00 p.m.

303
00:17:13.229 --> 00:17:15.531
Do not miss that boat.

304
00:17:15.565 --> 00:17:18.368
Okay, I'm gonna set my
alarm so we don't miss it.

305
00:17:18.401 --> 00:17:20.871
Wait, you're
not taking us back?

306
00:17:20.904 --> 00:17:22.238
Thank god.

307
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:23.874
No, the discount
didn't say anything

308
00:17:23.907 --> 00:17:26.309
about a trip home, okay?

309
00:17:26.342 --> 00:17:27.143
So.

310
00:17:38.554 --> 00:17:40.223
Have fun, guys.

311
00:17:40.256 --> 00:17:41.592
Thanks.

312
00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:42.893
You're welcome.

313
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:16.760
Great.

314
00:18:16.794 --> 00:18:18.428
He left us for dead.

315
00:18:18.461 --> 00:18:20.931
Sam, why do you always have
to say stuff like that?

316
00:18:20.964 --> 00:18:21.899
Let's just go.

317
00:18:21.932 --> 00:18:24.500
We only have about six hours.

318
00:18:24.534 --> 00:18:25.769
Only six hours.

319
00:18:34.477 --> 00:18:37.380
I think I was born
to be an island girl.

320
00:18:37.413 --> 00:18:38.615
Can we all move here?

321
00:18:38.649 --> 00:18:40.450
I could never live here.

322
00:18:40.483 --> 00:18:41.384
Why?

323
00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:42.586
It's beautiful.

324
00:18:42.619 --> 00:18:45.321
'Cause I need people
and things to do.

325
00:18:45.354 --> 00:18:46.657
Well, you can literally
do anything here.

326
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.357
You could go to the beach

327
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:50.027
or you could go
surfing or hiking.

328
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:50.894
Yeah, no.

329
00:18:53.463 --> 00:18:56.532
Couldn't do it because
I need strip clubs.

330
00:18:56.566 --> 00:18:58.534
Really, strip clubs?

331
00:18:58.568 --> 00:19:00.336
I love strip clubs.

332
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:04.440
Thank you, by the way.

333
00:19:04.474 --> 00:19:05.341
For what?

334
00:19:06.577 --> 00:19:08.311
What you did.

335
00:19:08.344 --> 00:19:09.512
What did I do?

336
00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.315
Bringing me here.

337
00:19:12.348 --> 00:19:14.718
It was all of our ideas.

338
00:19:14.752 --> 00:19:17.988
Yeah, but Bree
may have mentioned

339
00:19:18.021 --> 00:19:20.389
that you paid for my ticket.

340
00:19:21.692 --> 00:19:24.828
I just know how much
you like these things.

341
00:19:24.862 --> 00:19:26.764
I really appreciate it.

342
00:19:26.797 --> 00:19:28.264
You're welcome.

343
00:19:37.941 --> 00:19:41.544
I am literally
already out of breath.

344
00:19:41.578 --> 00:19:45.082
I think that's probably
the alcohol talking.

345
00:19:45.115 --> 00:19:46.549
Super original.

346
00:19:47.818 --> 00:19:49.620
You should write that
in your next book.

347
00:19:49.653 --> 00:19:50.921
If you should be so lucky

348
00:19:50.954 --> 00:19:52.956
to inspire anything
I write, Sam.

349
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.357
I know I don't want to
be anything you write

350
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.926
if it involves ghosts.

351
00:19:57.426 --> 00:19:59.596
Seriously, why do you believe?

352
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.033
Like you really want
to hear my explanation.

353
00:20:03.066 --> 00:20:04.534
I do seriously.

354
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.671
Okay.

355
00:20:09.372 --> 00:20:13.043
First of all, if there
isn't some other dimension,

356
00:20:13.076 --> 00:20:16.780
then how do you explain
that almost every religion

357
00:20:16.814 --> 00:20:19.082
since the origin of
the human species

358
00:20:19.116 --> 00:20:20.851
believes in the afterlife?

359
00:20:20.884 --> 00:20:22.119
And on top of that,

360
00:20:22.152 --> 00:20:24.554
they talk about some
way of communicating

361
00:20:24.588 --> 00:20:27.057
with deceased
ancestors or deities.

362
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.592
Like what about,

363
00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:30.928
what about praying and
celebrating holidays

364
00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:33.396
like Dia de los
Muertos, shamans?

365
00:20:33.429 --> 00:20:34.631
Okay, okay.

366
00:20:34.665 --> 00:20:37.100
I think that people
make up stories.

367
00:20:38.836 --> 00:20:41.738
How the earth was created,
how humans evolved,

368
00:20:41.772 --> 00:20:42.873
why we're here.

369
00:20:43.907 --> 00:20:45.609
Because those stories,

370
00:20:45.642 --> 00:20:49.079
they give people something
to believe in, right?

371
00:20:49.112 --> 00:20:51.782
Which makes people feel better.

372
00:20:51.815 --> 00:20:53.050
And most of the time,

373
00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:56.485
that translate into
them behaving better.

374
00:20:56.519 --> 00:20:58.554
The Bible, the
Quran, cave walls,

375
00:20:58.589 --> 00:21:01.158
all of these like
religious writings,

376
00:21:01.191 --> 00:21:04.595
they all promise this
beautiful afterlife

377
00:21:04.628 --> 00:21:06.864
because it makes
people feel better.

378
00:21:06.897 --> 00:21:08.799
They need something
to believe in,

379
00:21:08.832 --> 00:21:10.767
hence the stories.

380
00:21:10.801 --> 00:21:12.669
I could be wrong.

381
00:21:12.703 --> 00:21:13.536
Okay.

382
00:21:15.072 --> 00:21:19.009
So you believe that because
people need to believe,

383
00:21:20.677 --> 00:21:21.845
it all is fake?

384
00:21:23.046 --> 00:21:23.847
Yeah.

385
00:21:25.182 --> 00:21:26.750
All right.

386
00:21:26.783 --> 00:21:29.552
What about all of the
photographic evidence

387
00:21:29.586 --> 00:21:32.089
of apparitions that we have?

388
00:21:32.122 --> 00:21:32.923
Fake.

389
00:21:33.957 --> 00:21:35.125
Poltergeist occurrences

390
00:21:35.158 --> 00:21:38.161
where there are
multiple eye witnesses.

391
00:21:39.162 --> 00:21:39.997
Bullshit.

392
00:21:41.632 --> 00:21:43.634
My grandmother's spirit

393
00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:45.135
visiting me the
night that she died.

394
00:21:45.168 --> 00:21:46.637
Definitely fake.

395
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.074
Oh, you're serious?

396
00:21:51.108 --> 00:21:54.645
I know it sounds
stupid, but it happened.

397
00:21:55.979 --> 00:21:57.648
When I was younger,

398
00:21:57.681 --> 00:21:58.916
we didn't really talk to
my grandparents very much.

399
00:21:58.949 --> 00:22:02.686
And I was doing my homework
one night in my room

400
00:22:05.088 --> 00:22:06.657
and I noticed that
in the corner,

401
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.693
there she was just
sitting in the chair.

402
00:22:09.726 --> 00:22:12.095
I mean, she wasn't solid, but
I could totally make her out.

403
00:22:12.129 --> 00:22:15.564
I could see her face
and she smiled at me.

404
00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:18.168
She looked straight into my eyes

405
00:22:18.201 --> 00:22:19.603
and she didn't have
to say anything,

406
00:22:19.636 --> 00:22:23.472
but I just knew it
was gonna be okay.

407
00:22:23.506 --> 00:22:25.474
And then she was gone.

408
00:22:25.508 --> 00:22:28.912
So I told my mom and she
gave me the exact look

409
00:22:28.946 --> 00:22:30.013
that you're giving me now.

410
00:22:30.047 --> 00:22:31.014
I am listening.

411
00:22:31.048 --> 00:22:32.683
That I was crazy.

412
00:22:34.584 --> 00:22:35.819
But then the next morning,

413
00:22:35.852 --> 00:22:38.021
we got a call and
she'd passed away.

414
00:22:38.055 --> 00:22:39.856
So I looked it up, okay?

415
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.591
I looked it up

416
00:22:41.625 --> 00:22:43.126
and it turns out that
there are a lot of accounts

417
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.697
where people,
relatives, spirits,

418
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.166
visit them in between
when they leave this earth

419
00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:50.901
and they enter another plane.

420
00:22:50.934 --> 00:22:53.236
You're gonna
post these instantly.

421
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.973
I don't know, I
could be wrong, but.

422
00:22:56.006 --> 00:22:58.075
I can't argue with that story.

423
00:22:59.776 --> 00:23:01.611
Great, now which way?

424
00:23:11.288 --> 00:23:12.923
Oh, there's a map.

425
00:23:17.094 --> 00:23:18.527
Okay, we're here.

426
00:23:19.596 --> 00:23:20.897
No, we're here.

427
00:23:20.931 --> 00:23:21.832
No, we're not.

428
00:23:21.865 --> 00:23:24.001
Bree, which way is north?

429
00:23:25.702 --> 00:23:27.270
Is that a thing people know?

430
00:23:27.304 --> 00:23:29.239
That's
exactly what I thought.

431
00:23:29.272 --> 00:23:30.941
And now we're lost.

432
00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:31.975
No, wait, wait, we're not lost.

433
00:23:32.009 --> 00:23:33.143
Look.

434
00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:34.644
We landed here on the beach.

435
00:23:34.678 --> 00:23:36.046
We took this trail to there

436
00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:37.280
and now we're just
somewhere in there.

437
00:23:37.314 --> 00:23:38.749
Exactly.

438
00:23:38.782 --> 00:23:41.251
So we should go
to the waterfall.

439
00:23:42.252 --> 00:23:43.120
What?

440
00:23:43.153 --> 00:23:44.121
No, guys.

441
00:23:44.154 --> 00:23:45.722
We have to go to the resort.

442
00:23:45.756 --> 00:23:49.192
Okay, that trail
is not on that map,

443
00:23:49.226 --> 00:23:51.995
but it looks like it goes
pretty much directly there.

444
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:53.630
Lex, it's your birthday.

445
00:23:53.663 --> 00:23:55.699
And I need pictures.

446
00:23:55.732 --> 00:23:57.768
Do not say it.

447
00:23:57.801 --> 00:23:58.635
Don't say it.

448
00:23:58.668 --> 00:23:59.970
Gram!

449
00:24:00.003 --> 00:24:01.805
I need my pictures
for my Instagram.

450
00:24:01.838 --> 00:24:04.841
I hate the world for
creating that word,

451
00:24:04.875 --> 00:24:06.243
but I'm down for the naked swim.

452
00:24:06.276 --> 00:24:07.911
Let's just go for a little bit.

453
00:24:07.944 --> 00:24:09.579
Yeah, we don't know where
this trail's gonna take us,

454
00:24:09.613 --> 00:24:12.215
but we do know we can get
there from the waterfall.

455
00:24:12.249 --> 00:24:15.085
Or we could just take the
shortcut to the resort.

456
00:24:15.118 --> 00:24:15.952
Okay.

457
00:24:15.986 --> 00:24:17.587
Who votes waterfall?

458
00:24:17.621 --> 00:24:18.622
I vote yes.

459
00:24:23.326 --> 00:24:24.761
So stupid.

460
00:24:24.795 --> 00:24:26.663
- Okay, let's go.
- Yup.

461
00:24:26.696 --> 00:24:28.365
Guys, it's my birthday.

462
00:24:28.398 --> 00:24:30.867
Shouldn't I have some
sort of say in what we do?

463
00:24:30.901 --> 00:24:32.803
Happy birthday!

464
00:24:43.046 --> 00:24:44.614
It's amazing, dude.

465
00:24:44.648 --> 00:24:46.083
Go on, get naked.

466
00:24:46.116 --> 00:24:47.617
After you.

467
00:24:58.028 --> 00:25:01.031
Oh my gosh, it's cold!

468
00:25:01.064 --> 00:25:02.365
I take it the water
feels so good.

469
00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:05.135
- Sam, come on, man!
- What, dude?!

470
00:25:08.338 --> 00:25:09.606
Lex, come on!

471
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:15.112
Lex, get in!

472
00:25:16.146 --> 00:25:17.013
I'm okay.

473
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.950
Oh baby!

474
00:25:22.385 --> 00:25:24.287
We really should
get going, guys.

475
00:25:24.321 --> 00:25:25.222
Come on!

476
00:25:25.255 --> 00:25:26.056
Come on, Lex!

477
00:25:26.089 --> 00:25:27.090
Live a little.

478
00:25:27.124 --> 00:25:30.160
Woo!

479
00:25:31.728 --> 00:25:33.663
I hate you all.

480
00:25:33.697 --> 00:25:34.297
Come on!

481
00:25:35.899 --> 00:25:36.867
Get in here!

482
00:25:39.469 --> 00:25:41.204
Don't watch me!

483
00:25:41.238 --> 00:25:42.372
Ow, ow!

484
00:25:42.405 --> 00:25:44.241
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

485
00:25:44.274 --> 00:25:47.811
Turn around!

486
00:26:12.002 --> 00:26:15.172
That was the last time
I felt truly safe.

487
00:26:16.473 --> 00:26:19.843
That was the last
time I felt peaceful.

488
00:26:19.876 --> 00:26:24.047
You know, the way that
trip was supposed to be.

489
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.115
But if I had been
paying attention,

490
00:26:25.148 --> 00:26:26.983
I would have noticed it.

491
00:26:27.017 --> 00:26:28.351
Something was off.

492
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.855
Something was around us.

493
00:26:35.926 --> 00:26:37.360
And what was that?

494
00:26:38.762 --> 00:26:39.664
The island.

495
00:26:41.097 --> 00:26:44.935
Island was trying
to tell us to leave.

496
00:26:44.968 --> 00:26:45.969
The island?

497
00:26:47.837 --> 00:26:49.439
I know you don't believe
me and it's fine.

498
00:26:49.472 --> 00:26:51.875
You don't have to.

499
00:26:51.908 --> 00:26:53.877
It's not that I
don't believe you.

500
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.512
I'm just trying to figure
out what's happening here

501
00:26:55.545 --> 00:26:57.347
so I can help your friends.

502
00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.850
You'll just think
that I'm crazy.

503
00:27:00.884 --> 00:27:05.355
Alexandra, I can promise you
I won't think you're crazy.

504
00:27:08.358 --> 00:27:10.794
Did you run into anybody?

505
00:27:10.827 --> 00:27:13.997
Did you see anything
out of the ordinary?

506
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:22.405
Does it smell weird?

507
00:27:22.439 --> 00:27:24.841
Yeah, it just kinda
smells like tequila.

508
00:27:24.874 --> 00:27:26.243
I think it spilled all
over it in the bag.

509
00:27:26.276 --> 00:27:29.045
That's completely disgusting.

510
00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:30.146
No, I'm good.

511
00:27:31.815 --> 00:27:33.316
Tequila ham.

512
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.417
Yeah.

513
00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:35.452
Mmm.

514
00:27:36.953 --> 00:27:37.954
I just can't eat.

515
00:27:37.988 --> 00:27:39.389
Oh no, you just say that
'cause you're so scared

516
00:27:39.422 --> 00:27:41.124
of all the ghosts
you're gonna see.

517
00:27:41.157 --> 00:27:42.225
There's so many
ghosts on the island.

518
00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:43.193
I know you're afraid.

519
00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:44.494
I know, they're everywhere.

520
00:27:46.396 --> 00:27:48.431
What do you believe, Chris?

521
00:27:48.465 --> 00:27:50.133
Well, I mean, I believe
there could be ghosts, yeah.

522
00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:51.368
Dude, come on.

523
00:27:52.502 --> 00:27:54.104
What?

524
00:27:54.137 --> 00:27:55.572
I mean, granted I've
never had any experience,

525
00:27:55.606 --> 00:27:57.574
yeah, but it doesn't mean
I can't see both sides.

526
00:27:57.608 --> 00:27:58.908
Well, I have.

527
00:27:58.942 --> 00:28:00.443
Bullshit.

528
00:28:00.477 --> 00:28:02.312
Yeah, then what was that
painful monologue earlier

529
00:28:02.345 --> 00:28:04.014
about not believing?

530
00:28:05.849 --> 00:28:10.020
You guys want to know
something I never told you?

531
00:28:10.053 --> 00:28:12.889
I was really
religious growing up.

532
00:28:12.922 --> 00:28:14.357
I grew up in a Christian house.

533
00:28:14.391 --> 00:28:16.960
We went to church every Sunday.

534
00:28:16.993 --> 00:28:19.396
We did the whole thing.

535
00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:23.033
And one night, I woke
up and I couldn't move.

536
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.907
I could feel like this
presence on top of me,

537
00:28:32.409 --> 00:28:34.077
like an evil spirit.

538
00:28:35.646 --> 00:28:39.449
And it was terrifying,
so I prayed and I prayed.

539
00:28:41.284 --> 00:28:43.920
And finally, I could move again.

540
00:28:47.524 --> 00:28:49.125
I feel like there's
a but coming.

541
00:28:49.159 --> 00:28:51.361
But in college, I learned
about sleep paralysis,

542
00:28:51.394 --> 00:28:53.897
which basically is
when you're sleeping,

543
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.033
your body goes into this,
it paralyzes itself,

544
00:28:57.067 --> 00:28:59.436
so you don't go act
out your dreams.

545
00:28:59.469 --> 00:29:00.904
When that doesn't work right,

546
00:29:00.937 --> 00:29:05.208
you wake up in a dream
state feeling paralyzed.

547
00:29:05.241 --> 00:29:06.142
People feel fear.

548
00:29:06.176 --> 00:29:07.010
They hear things.

549
00:29:07.043 --> 00:29:08.244
They see things.

550
00:29:10.146 --> 00:29:11.881
So what's more likely?

551
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:16.052
Demon came into a
12 year old's room,

552
00:29:16.086 --> 00:29:17.354
gave him the people's elbow,

553
00:29:17.387 --> 00:29:19.356
held him down for
a couple minutes,

554
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:22.892
or it was a little
sleep paralysis.

555
00:29:22.926 --> 00:29:24.595
Again, I could be wrong.

556
00:29:26.296 --> 00:29:28.264
You know, you keep saying
that you could be wrong.

557
00:29:28.298 --> 00:29:30.567
Is that because
you know you are?

558
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:31.401
Ooh.

559
00:29:32.369 --> 00:29:34.404
Well, what do you believe?

560
00:29:34.437 --> 00:29:36.640
Well, I feel like
if there's a God,

561
00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:39.943
then there has to be an evil.

562
00:29:39.976 --> 00:29:43.581
And so if you believe
in like, goodness,

563
00:29:43.614 --> 00:29:45.583
then there has to be
stuff like demons,

564
00:29:45.616 --> 00:29:48.418
and spirits, and
negative things.

565
00:29:48.451 --> 00:29:50.453
So how do you really know?

566
00:29:53.957 --> 00:29:55.058
Are you mad?

567
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:55.892
No.

568
00:29:56.694 --> 00:30:00.063
I just got to drain the lizard.

569
00:30:00.096 --> 00:30:01.431
He's so dramatic.

570
00:30:04.134 --> 00:30:05.535
I think he's mad.

571
00:30:33.096 --> 00:30:34.130
Chris?

572
00:30:34.164 --> 00:30:35.633
More than a hundred.

573
00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:36.466
A million.

574
00:30:36.499 --> 00:30:38.368
There's a lot.

575
00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:39.335
Come here.

576
00:30:40.704 --> 00:30:41.971
Hurry up, dude.

577
00:30:44.174 --> 00:30:44.941
Hurry.

578
00:30:55.686 --> 00:30:56.486
What the?

579
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:01.592
Stay with the girls.

580
00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:02.425
I'll go check it out.

581
00:31:02.459 --> 00:31:03.326
Yeah.

582
00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:04.160
Who is that?

583
00:31:10.433 --> 00:31:12.535
Chris, be careful.

584
00:31:12.569 --> 00:31:14.571
Guys, it's just a sheet.

585
00:31:18.074 --> 00:31:19.476
Fuck that.

586
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:21.077
I actually thought someone
was standing there.

587
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.179
Wow, you scare pretty easily.

588
00:31:23.213 --> 00:31:24.013
He's all talk.

589
00:31:24.047 --> 00:31:24.715
No.

590
00:31:24.748 --> 00:31:26.617
No, you all.

591
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.151
That just further
proves my point.

592
00:31:28.184 --> 00:31:30.654
You all saw someone
standing there, right?

593
00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:32.255
Okay.

594
00:31:32.288 --> 00:31:33.189
Okay.

595
00:31:33.223 --> 00:31:34.090
Guys, let's leave.

596
00:31:34.123 --> 00:31:35.358
Let's keep going.

597
00:31:35.391 --> 00:31:36.259
Yeah.

598
00:31:38.662 --> 00:31:40.430
Yeah, we have about four
hours 'til the boat leaves,

599
00:31:40.463 --> 00:31:42.700
so I think if we had that way,

600
00:31:44.133 --> 00:31:45.168
the map says there's
a lookout point.

601
00:31:45.201 --> 00:31:46.369
Let's just go over there.

602
00:31:46.402 --> 00:31:47.504
Let's check it out, come on.

603
00:31:47.537 --> 00:31:49.272
- Your stories, terrible.
- Are the worst.

604
00:31:49.305 --> 00:31:51.007
I just like trash.

605
00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:59.282
I think that's the
top of the hill right there.

606
00:31:59.315 --> 00:32:00.584
Wait, stop.

607
00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:02.285
Bree, it wasn't a ghost.

608
00:32:02.318 --> 00:32:04.320
No, I'm saying there's a
cell phone tower right there

609
00:32:04.354 --> 00:32:06.322
and I don't have service.

610
00:32:06.356 --> 00:32:07.423
Bree.

611
00:32:11.762 --> 00:32:14.798
Bree, that's not a
cell phone tower.

612
00:32:14.832 --> 00:32:17.801
Yeah, it's a radio tower
and I doubt it works.

613
00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:19.302
It's probably been here
since Pearl Harbor days.

614
00:32:19.335 --> 00:32:20.704
Oh, Pearl Harbor.

615
00:32:22.405 --> 00:32:24.541
I'm a huge Michael Bay fan.

616
00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.279
What are you doing?

617
00:32:29.312 --> 00:32:30.814
I'm gonna climb it.

618
00:32:32.716 --> 00:32:34.718
Bet we can see the
resort from here.

619
00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:36.486
I wouldn't touch it.

620
00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:41.157
Do you think it's still active?

621
00:32:54.437 --> 00:32:56.506
Sam!

622
00:32:56.539 --> 00:32:58.776
Oh, my nipples are so hard!

623
00:32:58.809 --> 00:33:01.845
Sam!

624
00:33:08.284 --> 00:33:09.152
I got you.

625
00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:10.353
Why would you do that?

626
00:33:10.386 --> 00:33:13.156
Oh my god, I got you.

627
00:33:13.189 --> 00:33:14.123
You actually care about me.

628
00:33:14.157 --> 00:33:15.759
You're such an idiot.

629
00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.696
Guys, she cares about me.

630
00:33:18.729 --> 00:33:21.297
That was pretty good.

631
00:33:21.331 --> 00:33:23.099
It was pretty good.

632
00:33:35.579 --> 00:33:37.513
Anybody want some?

633
00:33:37.547 --> 00:33:38.916
- No.
- No.

634
00:33:38.949 --> 00:33:40.550
Okay.

635
00:33:40.584 --> 00:33:42.185
That's gotta be it.

636
00:33:42.218 --> 00:33:43.921
That's so far.

637
00:33:43.954 --> 00:33:45.421
It looks
like a half mile.

638
00:33:45.455 --> 00:33:46.456
Yeah, we can do that.

639
00:33:46.489 --> 00:33:48.458
We just have to hurry.

640
00:33:48.491 --> 00:33:50.794
Can we stay up here and
enjoy the view first?

641
00:33:50.828 --> 00:33:51.629
- No.
- No.

642
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:55.131
Okay.

643
00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:57.433
Fuck me.

644
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:21.290
Great.

645
00:34:21.324 --> 00:34:22.660
Now what?

646
00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:25.829
It looks like we got
a fence to climb.

647
00:34:27.497 --> 00:34:29.933
Oh, you guys, over here.

648
00:34:34.337 --> 00:34:34.938
Okay.

649
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.244
Oh, you're gonna rip it?

650
00:34:41.277 --> 00:34:42.913
Oh damn, girl!

651
00:34:44.414 --> 00:34:46.382
Oh my god, good for you.

652
00:34:46.416 --> 00:34:48.518
I mean, I work out.

653
00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:09.873
I don't get it.

654
00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:10.708
What?

655
00:35:12.375 --> 00:35:14.510
They had to have spent a
fortune building this place.

656
00:35:14.544 --> 00:35:16.747
And what, they just
let it go to rot?

657
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.016
Because it's haunted, Sam.

658
00:35:19.049 --> 00:35:20.416
Yeah.

659
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.654
Never seen anything
like this before

660
00:35:34.564 --> 00:35:36.800
Oh my gosh, you guys.

661
00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:38.802
Look at the difference.

662
00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:39.837
It's so pretty.

663
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.537
Yeah, looks great.

664
00:35:44.407 --> 00:35:46.342
This is so perfect for my story.

665
00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:47.678
I have to film it.

666
00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:50.013
So who's going first?

667
00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:50.848
I'll go.

668
00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:53.516
Or Lex will go first.

669
00:35:59.322 --> 00:35:59.923
Keep out.

670
00:36:05.495 --> 00:36:06.663
Hello!

671
00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:08.397
Jesus, Sam.

672
00:36:08.431 --> 00:36:09.499
Hello?!

673
00:36:09.532 --> 00:36:10.466
Guys, stop.

674
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.668
What?

675
00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:13.569
We're gonna draw
attention to ourselves.

676
00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:14.805
There is no one here.

677
00:36:14.838 --> 00:36:15.639
Relax.

678
00:36:16.907 --> 00:36:20.376
So much for Hawaii's
scariest resort.

679
00:36:20.409 --> 00:36:22.880
No ghosts, all stories.

680
00:36:22.913 --> 00:36:25.515
It's not like we're at the zoo.

681
00:36:25.548 --> 00:36:28.819
They're not just gonna
be on display, Sam.

682
00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:36.526
What's with
all the white sheets?

683
00:36:36.559 --> 00:36:37.995
I don't know.

684
00:36:38.028 --> 00:36:41.330
Maybe they were doing
construction or something.

685
00:37:15.999 --> 00:37:16.800
Yeah.

686
00:37:23.607 --> 00:37:24.641
Oh!

687
00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:26.610
Sam, what the fuck, man?!

688
00:37:26.643 --> 00:37:28.011
I've always wanted to do that!

689
00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:30.814
Sam, you can't just
start breaking stuff.

690
00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:31.648
Why not?

691
00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:34.885
Sam!

692
00:37:34.918 --> 00:37:36.019
See?

693
00:37:36.053 --> 00:37:37.486
God, man.

694
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.756
I think you've had
enough to drink.

695
00:37:41.992 --> 00:37:44.493
You might actually be right.

696
00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:50.667
That's a hell of a drop.

697
00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:51.969
Yeah.

698
00:37:52.002 --> 00:37:54.071
Okay, should we go
check out the room?

699
00:37:54.104 --> 00:37:55.438
306?

700
00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:56.472
Yeah.

701
00:37:56.505 --> 00:37:58.474
What, are you scared now too?

702
00:37:58.507 --> 00:38:00.744
Oh, they got one of
those old thingumajigs.

703
00:38:00.777 --> 00:38:04.081
It's called a
bell cart, genius.

704
00:38:04.114 --> 00:38:06.950
Looks like the whip!

705
00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.886
Sam, you're an idiot.

706
00:38:09.853 --> 00:38:11.121
Oh, you don't get it?

707
00:38:11.154 --> 00:38:12.723
What, that you're an idiot?

708
00:38:12.756 --> 00:38:13.624
Ghost.

709
00:38:16.793 --> 00:38:17.628
All right.

710
00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:54.598
Looks like somebody
was just here.

711
00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:55.732
There probably was.

712
00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:56.633
Don't say that.

713
00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.201
You're scaring me.

714
00:38:58.235 --> 00:38:59.937
I'm gonna go explore
downstairs first.

715
00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.504
By yourself?

716
00:39:01.537 --> 00:39:02.806
Are you crazy?

717
00:39:02.839 --> 00:39:04.540
I'm literally just
going right down here.

718
00:39:04.573 --> 00:39:05.776
Let him.

719
00:39:05.809 --> 00:39:06.910
Maybe a ghost will
get him first.

720
00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:08.211
We can only hope.

721
00:39:08.245 --> 00:39:11.114
I think this
is the third floor.

722
00:39:12.215 --> 00:39:14.017
This place is creepy.

723
00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:22.525
Guys!

724
00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:26.229
Way better down here.

725
00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:27.164
Wait, stop.

726
00:39:27.197 --> 00:39:28.665
I want to take a picture.

727
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:29.900
Oh, get ready.

728
00:39:35.772 --> 00:39:36.873
More squats!

729
00:39:39.042 --> 00:39:40.844
You used to like it.

730
00:39:44.247 --> 00:39:46.116
She definitely liked it.

731
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.093
Smells like Sam's ass.

732
00:39:58.862 --> 00:40:01.131
Somebody definitely
died in here.

733
00:40:01.164 --> 00:40:03.667
Wait, so what happened
in here again?

734
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.770
This is the place where
the lights used to flicker

735
00:40:06.803 --> 00:40:08.739
and people heard voices.

736
00:40:09.873 --> 00:40:12.275
Yeah, and they
reported seeing writing

737
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:14.878
in the mirror with
the two showers.

738
00:40:14.911 --> 00:40:15.746
Shit.

739
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:55.285
How's the view?

740
00:40:55.318 --> 00:40:57.821
You're standing
in the pool!

741
00:40:57.854 --> 00:40:59.156
Yeah.

742
00:40:59.189 --> 00:41:00.957
It's filled with dirt.

743
00:41:02.225 --> 00:41:03.727
Wow.

744
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.262
What a view.

745
00:41:05.295 --> 00:41:07.297
Sam, you should come up here.

746
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.966
This place is fucking massive.

747
00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:13.303
Gotta be some ghosts.

748
00:41:14.938 --> 00:41:17.641
Should we look at the bathroom?

749
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.179
What do you think
happened in here?

750
00:41:22.212 --> 00:41:23.346
I don't know.

751
00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:30.087
Could you imagine
taking a shower

752
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.656
and coming out to see
writing in the mirror?

753
00:41:32.689 --> 00:41:34.925
I mean, you would think somebody
was playing a joke on you.

754
00:41:34.958 --> 00:41:37.928
I'd be more scared
of the voices.

755
00:41:37.961 --> 00:41:39.963
Yeah, fuck that.

756
00:41:40.997 --> 00:41:42.265
Oh wait, this is the room

757
00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:43.633
that the bellmen
wouldn't come in.

758
00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:44.267
Yeah.

759
00:41:48.238 --> 00:41:52.209
You know, Sam better not
come scare us right now.

760
00:41:54.978 --> 00:41:55.946
You know what,

761
00:41:55.979 --> 00:41:57.180
could you take a picture of me

762
00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:59.282
with the mirror
in the background?

763
00:41:59.316 --> 00:42:00.317
Of course.

764
00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:01.151
Thanks.

765
00:42:06.456 --> 00:42:09.893
Nothing especially odd
happened in room 306.

766
00:42:09.926 --> 00:42:12.129
I was just taking photos

767
00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:16.399
of what I thought was
important for my story.

768
00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:19.336
So you did take photos
inside of the resort?

769
00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:20.203
Yes.

770
00:42:22.906 --> 00:42:23.740
Why?

771
00:42:25.242 --> 00:42:29.045
Your phone, there's no
photos inside the resort.

772
00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:32.315
They stop upon your arrival.

773
00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:36.319
So there aren't any of
the rooms or room 306?

774
00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:37.154
No.

775
00:42:39.322 --> 00:42:41.892
Is there something I'm missing?

776
00:42:44.427 --> 00:42:46.429
Before we left room 306,

777
00:42:47.964 --> 00:42:49.799
that's when it happened.

778
00:42:55.038 --> 00:42:55.872
Oh shit.

779
00:42:57.307 --> 00:42:58.108
What?

780
00:42:59.476 --> 00:43:00.710
You look amazing.

781
00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:02.012
Get a room.

782
00:43:02.045 --> 00:43:03.146
Can you take another one, babe?

783
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.115
My backpack looks stupid.

784
00:43:11.955 --> 00:43:14.791
- What is that?
- That doesn't sound good.

785
00:43:14.824 --> 00:43:17.060
Yeah, wait, what is that?

786
00:43:17.093 --> 00:43:18.895
Sam's probably
torturing some animals.

787
00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:31.374
Chris, you've gotta see this.

788
00:43:39.482 --> 00:43:41.117
That was so weird.

789
00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.453
The fuck was that?

790
00:43:43.486 --> 00:43:45.155
I don't know, man.

791
00:43:45.188 --> 00:43:48.058
Wow, of course we come
when it's a full moon.

792
00:43:48.091 --> 00:43:49.826
Yeah, well at least we got
some light on the hike back.

793
00:43:49.859 --> 00:43:51.161
Yeah, well, we should
probably go home.

794
00:43:51.194 --> 00:43:52.796
Wait, what?

795
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:53.763
I mean, we just got here.

796
00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:54.998
Yeah, but I don't
want to miss the boat.

797
00:43:55.031 --> 00:43:56.166
Yeah, Lex, come on.

798
00:43:56.199 --> 00:43:57.434
We all want to see something,

799
00:43:57.467 --> 00:43:58.335
but it's at least
an hour hike back

800
00:43:58.368 --> 00:43:59.836
and we'll be here all week.

801
00:43:59.869 --> 00:44:00.971
Let's just come back tomorrow.

802
00:44:01.004 --> 00:44:02.939
And pay for another
helicopter ride?

803
00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:04.040
No.

804
00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.275
It's already 5:45.

805
00:44:05.308 --> 00:44:07.944
Yeah, so we have a
little bit of time.

806
00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.012
We brought flashlights.

807
00:44:09.045 --> 00:44:10.280
Why would we do that

808
00:44:10.313 --> 00:44:11.781
if we weren't planning
on being here at night?

809
00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:14.050
Yeah, for the hike back.

810
00:44:14.084 --> 00:44:16.286
Sam, we're leaving.

811
00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:18.021
We just got here.

812
00:44:18.054 --> 00:44:18.888
Right?

813
00:44:21.157 --> 00:44:22.259
Guys, come on.

814
00:44:26.529 --> 00:44:28.131
Well, this sucks.

815
00:44:28.164 --> 00:44:30.333
I really need
something for my story.

816
00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:32.369
I know, I'm sorry.

817
00:44:32.402 --> 00:44:34.304
Maybe we'll see a ghost
back at the house.

818
00:44:34.337 --> 00:44:36.206
We have more time, guys.

819
00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:37.173
Not if we stay here.

820
00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:38.942
The darker it gets,

821
00:44:38.975 --> 00:44:39.576
the more dangerous it's
gonna be on the hike back.

822
00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.011
Dangerous?

823
00:44:41.044 --> 00:44:41.978
What do you think
is gonna happen?

824
00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:42.946
Somebody's gonna die?

825
00:44:42.979 --> 00:44:45.282
We have flashlights.

826
00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:46.116
Oh, god.

827
00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:48.852
Whoa.

828
00:44:48.885 --> 00:44:50.053
You think yours is
big enough, Sam?

829
00:44:50.086 --> 00:44:51.288
It can never be big enough.

830
00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:54.991
- That's what she...
- That's what she said!

831
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.494
You've been carrying that
in your bag the whole day?

832
00:44:57.527 --> 00:45:00.196
Yup, it's my travel light.

833
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.931
Your travel light?

834
00:45:01.965 --> 00:45:04.434
Guys, the weather is
getting really weird.

835
00:45:04.467 --> 00:45:07.037
Are you guys sure this
is where we came in at?

836
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.371
Yeah, this is where we entered.

837
00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:11.074
I remember that road over there.

838
00:45:11.107 --> 00:45:12.442
I don't.

839
00:45:12.475 --> 00:45:14.344
Yeah, I don't think
that this is right.

840
00:45:14.377 --> 00:45:16.146
Trust me, this is
where we entered.

841
00:45:16.179 --> 00:45:18.616
I think it was back there.

842
00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:21.017
No, we didn't walk that
far when we came in.

843
00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.353
No, it's around here somewhere.

844
00:45:23.386 --> 00:45:25.055
It's a giant hole.

845
00:45:25.088 --> 00:45:27.924
I think we'd see it if
we were close to it.

846
00:45:27.957 --> 00:45:28.558
You know what, man?

847
00:45:28.592 --> 00:45:29.459
Screw it.

848
00:45:29.492 --> 00:45:30.293
Let's just dig.

849
00:45:30.327 --> 00:45:31.861
You're gonna dig?

850
00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:32.362
- Do you have a better idea?
- It's a fence!

851
00:45:32.395 --> 00:45:33.296
It's a fence!

852
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.098
They keep us from going through!

853
00:45:35.131 --> 00:45:36.399
Well, until you come
up with a better idea,

854
00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:38.435
this is what I'm gonna do.

855
00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:47.043
Why don't we just find the
hole that we came through?

856
00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:49.379
You guys, where is my backpack?

857
00:45:49.412 --> 00:45:50.513
Did you leave it?

858
00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:51.348
No, no.

859
00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:54.217
I had it.

860
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.252
I had it in the room when
we were taking pictures

861
00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.188
and then I.

862
00:45:58.221 --> 00:46:01.491
Chris, you left my
backpack, didn't you?

863
00:46:01.524 --> 00:46:02.359
What?

864
00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:04.027
No.

865
00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:04.928
Sam, help me dig or we're
gonna miss the boat.

866
00:46:04.961 --> 00:46:06.563
I don't want to get dirty.

867
00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:09.099
Chris, you left it.

868
00:46:09.132 --> 00:46:09.966
Shit.

869
00:46:11.534 --> 00:46:13.136
I guess I got distracted
when the birds came

870
00:46:13.169 --> 00:46:14.371
and left it in the room,

871
00:46:14.404 --> 00:46:15.905
but can I just
buy you a new one?

872
00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:17.140
No.

873
00:46:17.173 --> 00:46:19.342
You guys, you want
me to leave my stuff?

874
00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:20.644
That's insane.

875
00:46:20.678 --> 00:46:22.412
Plus it has my phone
and my wallet in it.

876
00:46:22.445 --> 00:46:23.913
Lex, come on.

877
00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:25.415
Bree, if it was your phone,

878
00:46:25.448 --> 00:46:27.417
you would already be inside.

879
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.119
Yeah, but if it's
backed up, you're good.

880
00:46:29.152 --> 00:46:30.186
Well, it's not.

881
00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.521
How is it not backed up?

882
00:46:31.554 --> 00:46:33.156
Well, I don't think it is,

883
00:46:33.189 --> 00:46:35.024
but it doesn't matter because
I'm not leaving my stuff!

884
00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:35.925
Okay?

885
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:36.993
I need my phone.

886
00:46:37.026 --> 00:46:40.330
It has my pictures and
all of my notes on it!

887
00:46:41.464 --> 00:46:42.499
Lex, this isn't a good idea.

888
00:46:42.532 --> 00:46:44.000
Oh my god.

889
00:46:44.033 --> 00:46:45.335
I'll just meet
you at the boat, okay?

890
00:46:45.368 --> 00:46:47.137
Lex!

891
00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:48.438
Dude, this is the exact
part in a scary movie

892
00:46:48.471 --> 00:46:49.406
that pisses me off.

893
00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:51.574
Seriously, this is so stupid.

894
00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:08.558
It's 306 right there.

895
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.061
Can we move
a little faster?

896
00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:14.130
I don't have
a flashlight, Sam.

897
00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:16.032
Mine's big enough for all of us.

898
00:47:16.065 --> 00:47:17.367
Where is my bag, Chris?

899
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.369
I left it right here.

900
00:47:19.402 --> 00:47:20.203
You sure this is the room?

901
00:47:20.236 --> 00:47:22.405
Yes, this is 306.

902
00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:23.741
Then where's the bag?

903
00:47:23.774 --> 00:47:26.710
- You're being so unhelpful.
- Oh my god.

904
00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.313
Where are you going?

905
00:47:31.514 --> 00:47:33.617
Is there
anything over there?

906
00:47:33.651 --> 00:47:35.084
No?

907
00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:36.386
No, it's empty.

908
00:47:36.419 --> 00:47:37.721
Are you sure?

909
00:47:37.755 --> 00:47:39.289
Did you look all
around the corner?

910
00:47:39.322 --> 00:47:41.524
- It's not over there.
- It's am empty room, Lex.

911
00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:42.358
I know that.

912
00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:43.393
- It was before.
- It's pouring.

913
00:47:43.426 --> 00:47:44.294
We have to go or we're
gonna miss this boat.

914
00:47:44.327 --> 00:47:46.362
Okay, then let's
check the other rooms.

915
00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:48.131
Guys!

916
00:47:48.164 --> 00:47:50.200
I don't know where he is.

917
00:47:50.233 --> 00:47:52.001
Get in here!

918
00:47:53.536 --> 00:47:56.539
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know.

919
00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:58.174
I'm in here.

920
00:47:58.208 --> 00:47:59.008
Chris?

921
00:48:00.176 --> 00:48:00.977
Chris?

922
00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:06.516
God.

923
00:48:09.085 --> 00:48:10.320
Oh, shit.

924
00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:16.459
Found your bag.

925
00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:21.531
It was like that
when I came in here.

926
00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:26.102
Lex, your bag was
sitting in the corner.

927
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:30.774
We didn't even come
in this room though.

928
00:48:30.808 --> 00:48:34.210
Wait, but how did
your bag get in here?

929
00:48:35.813 --> 00:48:38.816
What I want to know is how
did a coyote get in here?

930
00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:42.686
I didn't even know they
had coyotes in Hawaii.

931
00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:45.021
They don't.

932
00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:52.328
It kind of looks
like it was escaping.

933
00:48:52.362 --> 00:48:53.329
From what?

934
00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.066
Guys, let's just
get the fuck out of here.

935
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:57.801
No.

936
00:48:59.737 --> 00:49:00.804
I should take a picture.

937
00:49:00.838 --> 00:49:02.372
Lex, come on.

938
00:49:02.405 --> 00:49:03.239
I know, I know.

939
00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:04.574
It'll be fast.

940
00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:06.342
Guys, I'm leaving.

941
00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:08.211
Okay, I'm going.

942
00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:09.673
Sam, thought you
quit smoking, man.

943
00:50:09.707 --> 00:50:10.506
I did.

944
00:50:11.642 --> 00:50:13.343
Don't lie.

945
00:50:13.376 --> 00:50:14.577
I'm not lying.

946
00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:22.820
I haven't smoked a cigarette
in over six months.

947
00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:25.388
Okay, but then who's is that?

948
00:50:27.423 --> 00:50:28.524
I don't know.

949
00:50:32.663 --> 00:50:33.897
Someone's here.

950
00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:39.268
Wait.

951
00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:41.337
Hit the light, hit the
light, hit the light.

952
00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:44.340
- Are we locked in?
- Hello?

953
00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:47.343
Hello?

954
00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.579
What are you doing?

955
00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:49.780
Bree, we're trespassing.

956
00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:50.748
They don't know
that we're in here.

957
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.448
And we don't know them.

958
00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:06.462
Sam, was there an
exit by the pool?

959
00:51:06.496 --> 00:51:08.297
I don't know.

960
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:09.265
I mean, I don't even think I
can get us back down there.

961
00:51:09.298 --> 00:51:10.266
Then why are we heading there?

962
00:51:10.299 --> 00:51:11.367
We can just ask them for a ride.

963
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:12.836
Because whoever that is

964
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:13.469
probably isn't gonna be
happy that we're in here.

965
00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:14.905
Whoa.

966
00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:26.249
Guys, turn that off.

967
00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:33.389
We need to have an exit now.

968
00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:35.191
I am not doing this.

969
00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:37.460
Okay.

970
00:51:37.493 --> 00:51:39.262
That thing we ran out
is near the front.

971
00:51:43.366 --> 00:51:43.934
Fuck it.

972
00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:50.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

973
00:51:50.506 --> 00:51:52.810
What, you got a better idea?

974
00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.577
I'll do it.

975
00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:04.755
Chris.

976
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:06.355
It's security.

977
00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:07.024
Everybody in!

978
00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:08.692
Wait, no, what?

979
00:52:08.726 --> 00:52:09.760
We can't steal their truck!

980
00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:10.828
Yeah, we can.

981
00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.695
What about them?

982
00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:12.663
What if they need help?

983
00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:13.496
Go fucking help them then.

984
00:52:13.529 --> 00:52:14.765
I'm getting out of here.

985
00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:15.966
Sam, just leave the
truck and run, man.

986
00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:16.800
I'm not leaving if
we have this truck!

987
00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:18.702
What are you doing?

988
00:52:18.736 --> 00:52:19.903
Chris, give me the fucking keys.

989
00:52:19.937 --> 00:52:20.838
I'm not giving
you the keys, man.

990
00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:22.472
Give me the fucking keys, Chris!

991
00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:24.908
Stop.

992
00:52:24.942 --> 00:52:25.843
We're not taking the truck.

993
00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:27.443
Get in the car, guys.

994
00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:28.712
Bree, get out!

995
00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:30.647
Chris, Chris, give Sam the keys.

996
00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:31.615
Let's go!

997
00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:32.983
Do you want to go to jail?

998
00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:34.550
Are you serious?

999
00:52:36.653 --> 00:52:37.621
Guys, guys!

1000
00:52:38.756 --> 00:52:39.957
Chris!

1001
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.858
- Bree, get out.
- Wait, what's going on?

1002
00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:42.358
Bree, open the door, Bree.

1003
00:52:42.391 --> 00:52:43.994
- Bree.
- Bree, how did you do that?

1004
00:52:44.027 --> 00:52:45.461
Why is it locked?

1005
00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:46.930
- Get out.
- Bree, what are you doing?

1006
00:52:46.964 --> 00:52:48.364
I didn't do that!

1007
00:52:48.397 --> 00:52:49.032
Can you hear me?

1008
00:52:49.066 --> 00:52:51.300
Yes, yes, I can hear you.

1009
00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:52.836
Guys.

1010
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:53.704
I think it's down here.

1011
00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:54.537
Could you please help me?

1012
00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:55.639
Wait, where is here?

1013
00:52:57.608 --> 00:52:59.542
Guys, get me out of here!

1014
00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.345
Guys!

1015
00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:10.821
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

1016
00:53:18.095 --> 00:53:19.596
Guys, guys!

1017
00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:24.500
Bree!

1018
00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:42.753
Bree!

1019
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:46.489
Oh my god.

1020
00:53:51.128 --> 00:53:53.329
What if she's down there?

1021
00:53:54.497 --> 00:53:55.666
What if she's still down there?

1022
00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:57.400
We have to help her.

1023
00:53:59.837 --> 00:54:01.404
There's nothing we can do.

1024
00:54:01.437 --> 00:54:02.405
No, I'm going.

1025
00:54:02.438 --> 00:54:04.141
I am going, I am going!

1026
00:54:04.174 --> 00:54:05.541
Stay here!

1027
00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:06.475
Stay here with me.

1028
00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:08.612
Let him go down there, okay?

1029
00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:10.981
Just let him go down there.

1030
00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:22.893
She's dead, isn't she?

1031
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.366
Nobody survives a
crash like that.

1032
00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:03.499
I got you.

1033
00:55:08.504 --> 00:55:09.072
I got you.

1034
00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:18.081
Okay, so you're saying that
this truck started on its own,

1035
00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:23.086
shifted into gear, and drove
your friend off the ledge?

1036
00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.453
Look, I know what
it sounds like,

1037
00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:26.590
but that's what happened.

1038
00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:28.091
Okay.

1039
00:55:28.125 --> 00:55:28.859
Excuse me if it sounds
like I don't believe you,

1040
00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:30.594
but I find it hard...

1041
00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:32.829
Hard to believe that a truck
could have a life of its own

1042
00:55:32.863 --> 00:55:34.631
and kill my friend.

1043
00:55:34.665 --> 00:55:36.900
Pretty much, yeah.

1044
00:55:36.934 --> 00:55:38.534
How do we know that she didn't

1045
00:55:38.567 --> 00:55:41.171
just knock it into gear
herself in a panic,

1046
00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.839
and then...

1047
00:55:42.873 --> 00:55:45.175
Because I was there and I
saw it with my own two eyes.

1048
00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:46.109
I'm sorry.

1049
00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.646
I didn't mean to upset you.

1050
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.848
I gotta cover all the angles.

1051
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:54.851
It's just that I'm not
used to chasing ghosts

1052
00:55:54.885 --> 00:55:57.154
in a homicide investigation.

1053
00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:59.089
Yeah, well,

1054
00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.857
I'm not used to
seeing my friends die

1055
00:56:00.891 --> 00:56:02.960
at the hands of one either.

1056
00:56:02.993 --> 00:56:05.696
It must have been
hard for you to see,

1057
00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:08.098
We hadn't seen anything yet.

1058
00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:12.035
Why are you doing that?

1059
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:13.704
What?

1060
00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:15.238
Shivering.

1061
00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:16.073
Huh?

1062
00:56:23.981 --> 00:56:26.149
What are you
guys looking at?

1063
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:28.685
What was that?

1064
00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:40.764
Run!

1065
00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:41.665
Run!

1066
00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:50.607
Guys, meet me over here.

1067
00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:53.143
Yes.

1068
00:56:54.644 --> 00:56:55.245
No, no.

1069
00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.682
Oh my god, you
gotta be kidding me!

1070
00:56:58.715 --> 00:56:59.716
God!

1071
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:01.284
Guys, move.

1072
00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:04.054
Fuck!

1073
00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:05.789
Why would the exit
door be chained?

1074
00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:06.857
Come on.

1075
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:07.556
There's gotta be
another way out.

1076
00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:08.191
Come on.

1077
00:57:20.237 --> 00:57:21.938
Sam, wait, wait.

1078
00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:22.873
Where are we going?

1079
00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:24.573
Just fucking run.

1080
00:57:24.608 --> 00:57:27.144
Wait, what the
fuck was that thing, man?

1081
00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:28.745
You guys say his eyes, right?

1082
00:57:28.779 --> 00:57:30.847
Did you see his eyes?

1083
00:57:30.881 --> 00:57:31.948
He had the white eyes.

1084
00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:34.351
That's what I mean.

1085
00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.887
I mean that they're
real (INDISTINCT).

1086
00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.789
Those videos were real.

1087
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.291
I don't know.

1088
00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:43.360
I don't know if our brains are
playing tricks on us or what,

1089
00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.996
but that was the realist
fucking ghost thing

1090
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:47.898
I have ever seen.

1091
00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:49.833
So, what should we do?

1092
00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:51.902
Sam, are you sure
you can't get us back

1093
00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:54.671
to that exit by the pool?

1094
00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:55.372
I'll fucking get us there.

1095
00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.173
Let's go.

1096
00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.575
Come on, come on, come on.

1097
00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:06.850
Wait, where are we?

1098
00:58:08.285 --> 00:58:11.988
This looks like a
fucking (INDISTINCT).

1099
00:58:12.022 --> 00:58:13.957
It's the basement.

1100
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.726
I think it's like storage
or maintenance or something.

1101
00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.763
This doesn't feel right.

1102
00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:20.897
Let's go back up.

1103
00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.724
Go, go!

1104
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.761
Guys, over here, over here.

1105
00:58:51.795 --> 00:58:52.395
Come on.

1106
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:55.799
This can't be happening.

1107
00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.100
Oh my god.

1108
00:58:57.134 --> 00:58:58.935
You guys, that was her.

1109
00:58:58.969 --> 00:59:00.203
That's the half-face girl.

1110
00:59:00.237 --> 00:59:01.838
Half-face girl?

1111
00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:04.841
That's just a fucking story.

1112
00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:07.177
I know what I saw.

1113
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.146
But we need to get
out of here now.

1114
00:59:09.179 --> 00:59:10.147
All these flashlights are dying.

1115
00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.748
All right.

1116
00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:14.017
Let's go back the way we came.

1117
00:59:15.819 --> 00:59:17.387
Why would we come
back the way we came?

1118
00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.388
We can't see shit.

1119
00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:19.856
We don't know what's down here.

1120
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:22.959
I am not going back to
face whatever that was.

1121
00:59:22.993 --> 00:59:26.229
Yeah, no, there has to be
another way outta here, man.

1122
00:59:26.263 --> 00:59:27.330
There's one.

1123
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:33.470
Okay, stay close so we
don't get separated.

1124
00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:34.304
We good?

1125
00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:36.806
Yeah.

1126
00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.041
Yeah.

1127
00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.810
Okay, let's get the
hell out of here.

1128
00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:46.149
There's no fucking
half-face girl.

1129
01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.955
Does anyone see anything?

1130
01:00:55.586 --> 01:00:56.386
Sam?

1131
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:59.389
Dude.

1132
01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:06.896
Sam?

1133
01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:07.530
Sam?

1134
01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:11.234
Stop messing around, man.

1135
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.937
Sam.

1136
01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.779
Sam?

1137
01:01:23.581 --> 01:01:24.347
Let's get out of here, man.

1138
01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:25.181
Come on.

1139
01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:30.353
Sam?

1140
01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:34.524
We gotta go.

1141
01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:35.525
Let's get out of here please.

1142
01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:36.526
Come on, Sam.

1143
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:41.197
Sam?

1144
01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:45.201
Oh man.

1145
01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:48.204
Come on.

1146
01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.007
Let's go.

1147
01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:37.187
Why?

1148
01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.988
Why would you do that?

1149
01:02:40.691 --> 01:02:41.458
Sam?

1150
01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.295
Please help me.

1151
01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:48.131
I'm sorry.

1152
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.548
What the fuck?!

1153
01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:22.031
Fuck, it's stuck!

1154
01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:23.233
Come on!

1155
01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.001
Fuck!

1156
01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.042
Lex.

1157
01:03:38.582 --> 01:03:39.382
Lex.

1158
01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:43.186

1159
01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:52.228
Lex!

1160
01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:56.600
Sam?

1161
01:03:58.669 --> 01:03:59.469
Lex.

1162
01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:06.209
Sam.

1163
01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:07.944
Lex!

1164
01:04:12.783 --> 01:04:13.584
Lex.

1165
01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.087
Oh, Lex.

1166
01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:29.633
Lex.

1167
01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.069
Lex!

1168
01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.237

1169
01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.673
Lex!

1170
01:04:35.706 --> 01:04:36.539
Lex.

1171
01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:46.082
I know you're in there.

1172
01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:48.318
Sam, please don't do this.

1173
01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:50.588
I know you're in there.

1174
01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:01.030
Go!

1175
01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:17.748
Oh, fuck.

1176
01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:30.186
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1177
01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:35.425

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

1179

- Bree, don't.

1184
01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:47.731
And then all I remember
is waking up here,

1185
01:07:47.765 --> 01:07:50.266
coming through the
hospital doors.

1186
01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:52.870
I can't remember
anything after that.

1187
01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:55.606
And there's a lot to take in.

1188
01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:57.540
And you see this woman?

1189
01:07:57.573 --> 01:07:58.776
Girl.

1190
01:07:58.809 --> 01:08:00.911
It was the half-face girl.

1191
01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:02.445
The girl, right.

1192
01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:05.883
She killed your friends.

1193
01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:07.584
Are you sure they're dead?

1194
01:08:07.618 --> 01:08:11.521
As sure as I see you here
now, I watched them die.

1195
01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:18.595
I can't even imagine
what you've gone through,

1196
01:08:18.629 --> 01:08:20.530
but I can promise you this.

1197
01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:23.199
Everything is gonna be okay now.

1198
01:08:24.635 --> 01:08:25.969
I'm gonna call the station.

1199
01:08:26.003 --> 01:08:27.604
We're gonna do a
search of the island.

1200
01:08:27.638 --> 01:08:32.375
We won't stop until we find
out who's responsible for this.

1201
01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.924
Yeah, I've got
some missing kids.

1202
01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:47.925
Okay.

1203
01:08:47.958 --> 01:08:48.759
Yeah, canine (INDISTINCT).

1204
01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:49.593
That would be good.

1205
01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.460
Thank you.

1206
01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.929
Okay, yeah.

1207
01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:54.631
Hey, chief has a chopper ready.

1208
01:08:55.766 --> 01:08:57.366
Okay.

1209
01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.534
Yeah, if you have that,
that would be great.

1210
01:08:58.568 --> 01:08:59.368
Thank you.

1211
01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:19.757
Ow!

1212
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:20.991
Help me!

1213
01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:21.859
Help!

1214
01:09:24.895 --> 01:09:25.696
No, no!

1215
01:09:27.698 --> 01:09:29.432
