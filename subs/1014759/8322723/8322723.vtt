1
00:01:13.997 --> 00:01:17.296
Charles, you have
finally lost your senses.

2
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.164
This venture is impossible.

3
00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:22.365
For some. Gentlemen, the only way
to achieve the impossible

4
00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:24.338
is to believe it is possible.

5
00:01:24.374 --> 00:01:26.205
That kind of thinking could ruin you.

6
00:01:26.342 --> 00:01:28.367
I'm willing to take that chance.

7
00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:32.972
Imagine trading posts
in Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...

8
00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:40.353
The nightmare again?

9
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.056
I won't be long.

10
00:01:48.398 --> 00:01:52.061
I'm falling down a dark hole,

11
00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.566
then I see strange creatures.

12
00:01:56.873 --> 00:01:59.068
What kind of creatures?

13
00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:05.706
Well, there's a dodo bird,
a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.

14
00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:07.875
I didn't know cats could smile.

15
00:02:08.184 --> 00:02:10.175
Neither did I.

16
00:02:10.653 --> 00:02:13.486
And there's a blue caterpillar.

17
00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:16.219
Blue caterpillar.

18
00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.019
Hmm.

19
00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:21.790
Do you think I've gone round the bend?

20
00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:31.897
I'm afraid so.
You're mad, bonkers, off your head.

21
00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:36.939
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

22
00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:41.606
It's only a dream, Alice.
Nothing can harm you there.

23
00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:45.586
But if you get too frightened,
you can always wake up. Like this.

24
00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:46.917
Ow!

25
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.799
Must we go?

26
00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:11.839
Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.

27
00:03:11.914 --> 00:03:13.609
They will notice.

28
00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.084
Where's your corset?

29
00:03:23.693 --> 00:03:25.285
And no stockings.

30
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:26.658
I'm against them.

31
00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.424
But you're not properly dressed.

32
00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:30.989
Who's to say what is proper?

33
00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:34.332
What if it was agreed that "proper"
was wearing a codfish on your head?

34
00:03:34.403 --> 00:03:36.496
- Would you wear it?
- Alice.

35
00:03:36.572 --> 00:03:39.302
To me, a corset is like a codfish.

36
00:03:39.342 --> 00:03:41.674
Please, not today.

37
00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:43.769
Father would have laughed.

38
00:03:45.348 --> 00:03:50.809
I'm sorry. I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.

39
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.345
Did you have bad dreams again?

40
00:03:53.422 --> 00:03:54.821
Only one.

41
00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:58.985
It's always the same,
ever since I can remember.

42
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:01.621
Do you think that's normal?

43
00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:04.360
Don't most people
have different dreams?

44
00:04:05.034 --> 00:04:06.695
I don't know.

45
00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:18.045
There. You're beautiful.

46
00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:20.676
Now, can you manage a smile?

47
00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.059
At last. We thought you'd never arrive.

48
00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:44.038
Alice, Hamish is waiting
to dance with you. Go.

49
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.042
You do realize it's well past 4:00.

50
00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.740
Now everything will have
to be rushed through.

51
00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:54.476
- I am sorry.
- Oh, never mind!

52
00:04:58.654 --> 00:05:02.818
Forgive my wife. She's been planning
this affair for over 20 years.

53
00:05:03.793 --> 00:05:06.023
If only Charles were here...

54
00:05:06.662 --> 00:05:08.220
My condolences.

55
00:05:08.898 --> 00:05:13.062
I think of your husband often.
He was truly a man of vision.

56
00:05:14.604 --> 00:05:18.233
I hope you don't think I've taken
advantage of your misfortunes.

57
00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:21.766
Of course not. I'm pleased
that you purchased the company.

58
00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:27.582
I was a fool for not investing in
his mad venture when I had the chance.

59
00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:30.052
Charles thought so, too.

60
00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:51.939
Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?

61
00:05:51.974 --> 00:05:55.000
On the contrary. I find it invigorating.

62
00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:02.406
Do I amuse you?

63
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:03.543
No.

64
00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.745
I had a sudden vision
of all the ladies in trousers

65
00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.916
and the men wearing dresses.

66
00:06:09.058 --> 00:06:11.891
I think you'll do best
to keep your visions to yourself.

67
00:06:11.927 --> 00:06:14.395
When in doubt, remain silent.

68
00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:25.804
Pardon us, sir.
Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.

69
00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:27.566
Where's your head?

70
00:06:27.643 --> 00:06:30.578
I was wondering
what it would be like to fly.

71
00:06:30.646 --> 00:06:31.704
Why would you spend your time

72
00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:33.976
thinking about
such an impossible thing?

73
00:06:34.016 --> 00:06:35.347
Why wouldn't I?

74
00:06:35.418 --> 00:06:38.683
My father said he sometimes believed
in six impossible things

75
00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:39.846
before breakfast.

76
00:06:42.858 --> 00:06:43.950
Come along.

77
00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:50.325
Alice, meet me under the gazebo
in precisely 10 minutes.

78
00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:54.163
We have a secret to tell you.

79
00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:56.262
If you're telling me,
then it's not much of a secret.

80
00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:58.864
- Perhaps we shouldn't.
- We decided we should.

81
00:06:58.908 --> 00:07:00.034
If we tell her, she won't be surprised.

82
00:07:00.076 --> 00:07:03.045
- Will you be surprised?
- Not if you tell me.

83
00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:04.876
But now you've brought it up,
you have to.

84
00:07:04.914 --> 00:07:07.508
- No, we don't.
- In fact, we won't.

85
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:10.177
I wonder if your mother knows

86
00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:13.814
that you two swim naked
in the Havershims' pond.

87
00:07:13.856 --> 00:07:16.256
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, but I would.

88
00:07:16.859 --> 00:07:19.487
There's your mother right now.

89
00:07:19.528 --> 00:07:21.553
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.

90
00:07:21.597 --> 00:07:23.792
You've ruined the surprise!

91
00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:26.567
I could strangle them!

92
00:07:26.602 --> 00:07:29.765
Everyone went to so much effort
to keep the secret.

93
00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:31.466
Does everyone know?

94
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.533
It's why they've all come.
This is your engagement party.

95
00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:39.640
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.
When you say yes...

96
00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:42.275
But I don't know
if I want to marry Hamish.

97
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:45.252
Who, then?
You won't do better than a lord.

98
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:52.687
You'll soon be 20, Alice.
That pretty face won't last forever.

99
00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:56.726
You don't want to end up
like Aunt Imogene.

100
00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:59.166
And you don't want to be a burden
on Mother, do you?

101
00:07:59.235 --> 00:08:00.395
No.

102
00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:02.734
So you'll marry Hamish.

103
00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:04.569
You will be as happy
as I am with Lowell,

104
00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:06.097
and your life will be perfect.

105
00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:07.765
It's already decided.

106
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.402
Alice, dear.

107
00:08:10.713 --> 00:08:12.408
I'll leave you to it.

108
00:08:12.448 --> 00:08:16.714
Shall we take a leisurely stroll
through the garden, just you and me?

109
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.555
Do you know what I've always dreaded?

110
00:08:23.592 --> 00:08:25.492
The decline of the aristocracy?

111
00:08:25.928 --> 00:08:29.455
Ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.

112
00:08:29.498 --> 00:08:32.990
You're bound to produce
little... Imbeciles!

113
00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:34.535
The gardeners have
planted white roses

114
00:08:34.603 --> 00:08:36.833
when I specifically asked for red.

115
00:08:36.906 --> 00:08:39.101
You could always paint the roses red.

116
00:08:39.141 --> 00:08:41.268
What an odd thing to say.

117
00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:45.777
You should know that my son
has extremely delicate digestion.

118
00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:50.417
- Did you see that?
- See what?

119
00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:53.115
- It was a rabbit, I think.
- Nasty things.

120
00:08:53.155 --> 00:08:55.851
I do enjoy setting the dogs on them.

121
00:08:56.392 --> 00:09:00.021
If you serve Hamish the wrong foods,
he could get a blockage.

122
00:09:01.297 --> 00:09:02.696
Did you see it that time?

123
00:09:02.765 --> 00:09:04.062
- See what?
- The rabbit.

124
00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:05.725
Don't shout.

125
00:09:05.801 --> 00:09:10.067
Now, pay attention.
Hamish said you were easily distracted.

126
00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:13.040
- What was I saying?
- Hamish has a blockage.

127
00:09:14.376 --> 00:09:18.142
I couldn't be more interested,
but you'll have to excuse me.

128
00:09:23.385 --> 00:09:24.852
Aunt Imogene.

129
00:09:25.988 --> 00:09:29.947
I think I'm going mad.
I keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.

130
00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:33.620
I can't be bothered
with your fancy rabbit now.

131
00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:35.823
I'm waiting for my fiancé.

132
00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:38.429
- You have a fiancé?
- Hmm.

133
00:09:41.303 --> 00:09:43.533
There! Did you see it?

134
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.064
He's a prince.

135
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:50.669
But, alas, he cannot marry me
unless he renounces his throne.

136
00:09:51.213 --> 00:09:53.078
It's tragic, isn't it?

137
00:09:53.349 --> 00:09:54.577
Very.

138
00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:05.824
Lowell?

139
00:10:06.228 --> 00:10:08.696
Alice. We were just...

140
00:10:10.032 --> 00:10:11.863
Hattie's an old friend.

141
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:13.892
I can see you're very close.

142
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:16.970
Look, you won't mention this
to your sister, will you?

143
00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:21.373
I don't know. I'm confused.
I need time to think.

144
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.574
Well, think about Margaret.
She'd never trust me again.

145
00:10:25.614 --> 00:10:27.741
You don't want to ruin her marriage,
do you?

146
00:10:27.783 --> 00:10:28.875
Me?

147
00:10:29.552 --> 00:10:33.511
But I'm not the one who's
sneaking around behind her back.

148
00:10:34.256 --> 00:10:35.780
There you are.

149
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.233
Alice Kingsleigh...

150
00:10:50.606 --> 00:10:51.834
Hamish.

151
00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:53.599
What is it?

152
00:10:53.642 --> 00:10:56.406
You have a caterpillar
on your shoulder.

153
00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.405
Ew.

154
00:10:59.214 --> 00:11:00.738
Don't hurt it.

155
00:11:06.055 --> 00:11:08.421
You'll want to wash that finger.

156
00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:14.489
Alice Kingsleigh,

157
00:11:20.102 --> 00:11:21.933
will you be my wife?

158
00:11:25.574 --> 00:11:26.836
Well,

159
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:31.170
everyone expects me to,

160
00:11:31.947 --> 00:11:34.438
and you're a lord.

161
00:11:35.618 --> 00:11:39.213
My face won't last,
and I don't want to end up like...

162
00:11:43.158 --> 00:11:45.922
But this is happening so quickly. I...

163
00:11:47.396 --> 00:11:48.920
I think I...

164
00:11:57.339 --> 00:11:58.897
I think I...

165
00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:02.071
I need a moment.

166
00:12:40.482 --> 00:12:41.676
Hello.

167
00:15:44.766 --> 00:15:46.631
It's only a dream.

168
00:16:28.644 --> 00:16:32.774
You'd think she would
remember all this from the first time.

169
00:16:34.249 --> 00:16:36.581
You've brought the wrong Alice.

170
00:16:36.618 --> 00:16:39.519
McTWISP: No, she's the right one.
I'm certain of it.

171
00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:27.735
She's the wrong Alice.

172
00:17:28.103 --> 00:17:29.798
McTWISP: Give her a chance.

173
00:18:46.948 --> 00:18:49.041
Curiouser and curiouser.

174
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.917
I told you she's the right Alice.

175
00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.448
I am not convinced.

176
00:18:58.527 --> 00:19:00.051
McTWISP: How is that for gratitude?

177
00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:03.587
I've been up there for weeks,
trailing one Alice after the next,

178
00:19:03.665 --> 00:19:05.929
and I was almost eaten
by other animals.

179
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:07.298
Can you imagine?

180
00:19:07.369 --> 00:19:12.136
<i>They go about entirely unclothed,
and they do their shukm in public.</i>

181
00:19:12.441 --> 00:19:14.909
- I had to avert my eyes.
- Doesn't look anything like herself.

182
00:19:14.943 --> 00:19:17.309
That's because she's the wrong Alice.

183
00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:20.143
- If she was, she might be.
- If she isn't, she ain't.

184
00:19:20.215 --> 00:19:23.241
- But if she were so, she would be.
- But she isn't, nohow.

185
00:19:23.285 --> 00:19:26.584
How can I be the wrong Alice
when this is my dream?

186
00:19:27.589 --> 00:19:29.614
And who are you, if I might ask?

187
00:19:29.658 --> 00:19:31.319
Oh, I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.

188
00:19:31.393 --> 00:19:33.418
Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.

189
00:19:33.462 --> 00:19:35.157
We should consult Absolem.

190
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.596
Exactly. Absolem will know who she is.

191
00:19:37.632 --> 00:19:40.123
- I'll escort you.
- Hey, it's not being your turn.

192
00:19:40.168 --> 00:19:41.328
So unfair.

193
00:19:41.403 --> 00:19:43.166
- Hey, leave off!
- Let go!

194
00:19:43.238 --> 00:19:45.832
- Are they always this way?
- Family trait.

195
00:19:45.907 --> 00:19:47.807
You can both escort her.

196
00:19:55.817 --> 00:19:59.048
- Who is this Absolem?
- He's wise. He's absolute.

197
00:19:59.121 --> 00:20:00.816
He's Absolem.

198
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.370
Who are you?

199
00:20:27.816 --> 00:20:29.078
Absolem?

200
00:20:29.151 --> 00:20:35.818
You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem.
The question is, who are you?

201
00:20:35.857 --> 00:20:37.654
Alice.

202
00:20:37.692 --> 00:20:39.216
We shall see.

203
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:42.687
What do you mean by that?
I ought to know who I am.

204
00:20:42.764 --> 00:20:48.566
Yes, you ought, stupid girl.
Unroll the Oraculum.

205
00:20:54.509 --> 00:20:59.708
The Oraculum, being a calendrical
compendium of Underland.

206
00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:06.053
- It's a calendar.
- Compendium.

207
00:21:06.087 --> 00:21:11.047
It tells of each and every day
since the Beginning.

208
00:21:11.593 --> 00:21:15.996
Today is Griblig Day
in the time of the Red Queen.

209
00:21:17.832 --> 00:21:21.268
Show her the Frabjous Day.

210
00:21:21.403 --> 00:21:24.895
Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the day
you slay the Jabberwocky.

211
00:21:26.575 --> 00:21:28.634
Sorry? Slay a what?

212
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.440
Oh, yeah. That being you, there,
with the Vorpal sword.

213
00:21:31.513 --> 00:21:34.448
No other swords can kill
the Jabberwocky, nohow.

214
00:21:34.516 --> 00:21:37.076
If it ain't Vorpal, it ain't dead.

215
00:21:37.719 --> 00:21:39.118
That's not me!

216
00:21:39.187 --> 00:21:40.484
I know!

217
00:21:41.122 --> 00:21:45.058
Resolve this for us, Absolem.
Is she the right Alice?

218
00:21:45.093 --> 00:21:47.288
Not hardly.

219
00:21:50.699 --> 00:21:53.190
- I told you.
- McTWISP: - Oh, dear.

220
00:21:53.235 --> 00:21:55.135
- I said so.
- I said so.

221
00:21:55.203 --> 00:21:56.795
Contrariwise,
you said she might be.

222
00:21:56.871 --> 00:21:58.771
No, you said she would be if she was.

223
00:21:58.807 --> 00:22:02.800
Little impostor. Pretending
to be Alice. She should be ashamed.

224
00:22:02.877 --> 00:22:04.811
I was so certain of you.

225
00:22:04.879 --> 00:22:07.905
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be the wrong Alice.

226
00:22:08.717 --> 00:22:11.914
Wait, this is my dream.

227
00:22:12.287 --> 00:22:15.814
I'm going to wake up now
and you'll all disappear.

228
00:22:23.431 --> 00:22:26.491
That's odd.
Pinching usually does the trick.

229
00:22:26.935 --> 00:22:28.835
I could stick you, if that would help.

230
00:22:29.137 --> 00:22:32.129
- It might, actually. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

231
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:33.833
Ow!

232
00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:39.509
- Bandersnatch!
- Bandersnatch!

233
00:23:29.197 --> 00:23:30.459
Wait.

234
00:23:33.335 --> 00:23:36.395
It's only a dream. Nothing can hurt me.

235
00:23:41.076 --> 00:23:42.168
What's she doing?

236
00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.901
Can't hurt me. Can't hurt me.

237
00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:52.209
Run, you great lug!

238
00:24:57.085 --> 00:24:58.916
This way, east to Queast.

239
00:24:58.953 --> 00:25:00.511
No, south to Snud.

240
00:25:00.588 --> 00:25:02.112
No. No, no. This way.

241
00:25:50.271 --> 00:25:53.638
Someone has stolen three of my tarts!

242
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.717
- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.

243
00:26:04.786 --> 00:26:06.686
- Did you?
- No, Your Majesty.

244
00:26:06.721 --> 00:26:09.212
- Did you steal them?
- No, Your Majesty.

245
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.124
Did you steal my tarts?

246
00:26:45.059 --> 00:26:46.788
No, Your Majesty.

247
00:26:53.501 --> 00:26:55.162
Squimberry juice.

248
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.268
- I was so hungry! I didn't mean to!
- Off with his head!

249
00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:00.569
My family! Oh, please, please don't!

250
00:27:00.608 --> 00:27:02.769
No! I have little ones to look after!

251
00:27:02.844 --> 00:27:04.368
Go to his house
and collect the little ones.

252
00:27:04.412 --> 00:27:06.744
I love tadpoles on toast
almost as much as I love caviar.

253
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:08.578
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.585
Drink!

255
00:27:18.693 --> 00:27:19.990
Majesty?

256
00:27:22.463 --> 00:27:27.901
Ilosovic Stayne, you knave,
where have you been lurking?

257
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:34.604
Majesty, I have found the Oraculum.

258
00:27:36.978 --> 00:27:40.175
That? Looks so ordinary for an oracle.

259
00:27:40.248 --> 00:27:42.910
Look here, on the Frabjous Day.

260
00:27:46.087 --> 00:27:48.988
I'd know that tangled mess
of hair anywhere.

261
00:27:49.157 --> 00:27:50.647
Is it Alice?

262
00:27:51.092 --> 00:27:52.787
I believe it is.

263
00:27:53.561 --> 00:27:55.961
What's she doing
with my darling Jabberwocky?

264
00:27:55.997 --> 00:27:58.261
She appears to be slaying it.

265
00:27:59.033 --> 00:28:01.331
She killed my Jabber-baby-wocky?

266
00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:06.135
Not yet, but it will happen
if we don't stop her.

267
00:28:06.741 --> 00:28:09.608
Find Alice, Stayne. Find her!

268
00:28:12.113 --> 00:28:15.378
Find the scent of human girl
and earn your freedom.

269
00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.848
For my wife and pups, as well?

270
00:28:19.954 --> 00:28:21.922
Everyone will go home.

271
00:28:35.336 --> 00:28:38.328
Dogs will believe anything.

272
00:29:10.672 --> 00:29:15.871
It looks like you ran afoul of something
with wicked claws.

273
00:29:16.678 --> 00:29:18.202
And I'm still dreaming.

274
00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:20.214
What did that to you?

275
00:29:20.748 --> 00:29:24.047
- Banner or Bander...
- The Bandersnatch?

276
00:29:24.385 --> 00:29:26.819
Well, I'd better have a look.

277
00:29:27.288 --> 00:29:28.585
What are you doing?

278
00:29:28.623 --> 00:29:32.389
It needs to be purified
by someone with evaporating skills,

279
00:29:32.427 --> 00:29:35.624
or it will fester and putrefy.

280
00:29:36.531 --> 00:29:40.467
I'd rather you didn't.
I'll be fine as soon as I wake up.

281
00:29:40.535 --> 00:29:43.436
At least let me bind it for you.

282
00:29:44.706 --> 00:29:48.142
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.

283
00:29:48.209 --> 00:29:50.074
The Alice?

284
00:29:51.112 --> 00:29:55.572
- There's been some debate about that.
- I never get involved in politics.

285
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:57.975
You'd best be on your way.

286
00:29:58.553 --> 00:30:02.580
What way? All I want to do is
wake up from this dream.

287
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.189
Fine.

288
00:30:04.258 --> 00:30:08.854
Then I'll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.

289
00:30:17.405 --> 00:30:18.770
Coming?

290
00:31:09.223 --> 00:31:10.349
Watch what you're doing!

291
00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:11.881
Hey, watch it!

292
00:31:15.229 --> 00:31:16.821
Okay, okay. All right.

293
00:31:16.864 --> 00:31:18.331
It's you.

294
00:31:18.366 --> 00:31:21.961
No, it's not.
McTwisp brought us the wrong Alice.

295
00:31:22.003 --> 00:31:23.664
It's the wrong Alice!

296
00:31:23.704 --> 00:31:25.569
It's absolutely Alice.

297
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.575
You're absolutely Alice.
I'd know you anywhere.

298
00:31:28.643 --> 00:31:30.577
I'd know him anywhere.

299
00:31:32.713 --> 00:31:35.511
Well, as you can see,
we're still having tea.

300
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.350
And it's all because I was obliged
to kill Time waiting for your return.

301
00:31:39.387 --> 00:31:42.220
You're terribly late, you know. Naughty.

302
00:31:42.824 --> 00:31:46.385
Well, anyway, Time became
quite offended and stopped altogether.

303
00:31:46.427 --> 00:31:47.951
Not a tick ever since.

304
00:31:50.264 --> 00:31:52.289
- Cup.
- Time can be funny in dreams.

305
00:31:52.366 --> 00:31:54.300
Yes, yes, of course,
but now you're back, you see,

306
00:31:54.368 --> 00:31:56.268
and we need to get on
to the Frabjous Day.

307
00:31:56.337 --> 00:31:58.271
- Frabjous Day!
- Frabjous Day!

308
00:31:58.339 --> 00:32:01.797
I'm investigating things
that begin with the letter "M."

309
00:32:03.211 --> 00:32:06.044
Have you any idea
why a raven is like a writing desk?

310
00:32:07.215 --> 00:32:08.910
<i>- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</i>

311
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.384
- What?
- Down with the Bloody Big Head,

312
00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:13.910
the Bloody Big Head
being the Red Queen.

313
00:32:13.955 --> 00:32:16.719
Come, come. We simply must
commence with the slaying and such.

314
00:32:16.757 --> 00:32:18.725
Therefore, it is high time
to forgive and forget

315
00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:20.727
or forget and forgive,
whichever comes first

316
00:32:20.761 --> 00:32:24.060
or is, in any case, most convenient.
I'm waiting.

317
00:32:24.098 --> 00:32:26.566
Hey.
It's tick-tick... It's ticking again.

318
00:32:26.601 --> 00:32:31.095
All this talk of blood and slaying
has put me off my tea.

319
00:32:31.372 --> 00:32:32.464
Ah.

320
00:32:33.374 --> 00:32:38.505
The entire world is falling to ruin
and poor Chessur's off his tea.

321
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.747
What happened that day
was not my fault.

322
00:32:44.085 --> 00:32:46.076
Oh, dear.

323
00:32:47.088 --> 00:32:49.750
You ran out on them
to save your own skin,

324
00:32:49.891 --> 00:32:51.825
<i>you guddler's scuttish pilgar lickering</i>

325
00:32:51.893 --> 00:32:54.020
<i>shukm juggling sluking urpal.</i>

326
00:32:54.095 --> 00:32:55.790
<i>Bar lom muck egg brimni!</i>

327
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.127
Hatter!

328
00:32:58.165 --> 00:33:00.360
- Thank you.
- Meow.

329
00:33:00.902 --> 00:33:01.994
I'm fine.

330
00:33:02.069 --> 00:33:05.505
What's wrong with you, Tarrant?
You used to be the life of the party.

331
00:33:05.573 --> 00:33:08.599
You used to do the best Futterwacken
in all of Witzend.

332
00:33:08.643 --> 00:33:10.941
- Futter what?
- Futterwacken!

333
00:33:10.978 --> 00:33:12.104
It's a dance.

334
00:33:13.281 --> 00:33:15.977
On the Frabjous Day,

335
00:33:16.017 --> 00:33:19.612
when the White Queen
once again wears the crown,

336
00:33:19.654 --> 00:33:25.615
on that day,
I shall Futterwacken vigorously.

337
00:33:28.663 --> 00:33:29.960
Oh, no.

338
00:33:31.432 --> 00:33:32.797
Uh-oh.

339
00:33:33.668 --> 00:33:35.693
The Knave.

340
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.964
Goodbye.

341
00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:39.166
Hide her!

342
00:33:39.206 --> 00:33:40.901
Drink this quickly.

343
00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.869
Quick! Hide her!

344
00:33:47.949 --> 00:33:49.382
Oh, dear.

345
00:33:53.454 --> 00:33:54.546
Aye.

346
00:33:56.891 --> 00:33:58.415
Mind your head.

347
00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.666
Let me out!

348
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:22.608
Well, if it's not my favorite
trio of lunatics.

349
00:34:23.084 --> 00:34:25.177
Would you like to join us?

350
00:34:26.387 --> 00:34:28.378
You're all late for tea!

351
00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.358
We're looking for the girl called Alice.

352
00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:41.125
Speaking of the Queen, here is a little
song we used to sing in her honor.

353
00:34:42.336 --> 00:34:44.327
<i>- Twinkle Twinkle little bat
- Twinkle Twinkle little bat</i>

354
00:34:44.372 --> 00:34:46.533
<i>- How I wonder where you're at
- How I wonder where you're at</i>

355
00:34:46.574 --> 00:34:48.542
<i>- Up a...
- Up a...</i>

356
00:34:48.576 --> 00:34:52.740
If you're hiding her,
you'll lose your heads.

357
00:34:52.847 --> 00:34:54.542
Already lost them.

358
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.281
All together now!

359
00:34:57.351 --> 00:34:59.376
<i>- Up above the world you fly
- Up above the world you fly</i>

360
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.718
<i>- Like a tea tray in the sky
- Like a tea tray in the sky</i>

361
00:35:01.756 --> 00:35:04.384
<i>- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle</i>

362
00:35:04.425 --> 00:35:06.484
<i>- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle</i>

363
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.721
<i>- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...
- Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle...</i>

364
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:10.122
Oh!

365
00:35:14.535 --> 00:35:16.799
<i>Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</i>

366
00:35:20.775 --> 00:35:22.834
Would you like some cream?

367
00:35:26.313 --> 00:35:29.180
- Would you like a slice of Battenberg?
- Follow the bloodhound.

368
00:35:30.384 --> 00:35:32.181
- Sugar?
- Yes, please.

369
00:35:33.387 --> 00:35:36.254
- Oh, that's lovely.
- You're all mad.

370
00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.287
Thanks very much.

371
00:35:40.161 --> 00:35:41.924
Pass the scones, please.

372
00:35:44.899 --> 00:35:46.332
- That one there.
- Oh! Pardon.

373
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.459
- Yes.
- Yep, aye.

374
00:35:48.502 --> 00:35:49.969
One moment.

375
00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:59.842
There. Yes.

376
00:36:00.081 --> 00:36:01.878
Try this on for size.

377
00:36:08.422 --> 00:36:09.719
Oh.

378
00:36:13.594 --> 00:36:14.856
I like it.

379
00:36:14.929 --> 00:36:18.558
Good thing the bloodhound
is one of us, or you'd be...

380
00:36:18.632 --> 00:36:20.293
What do they want with me?

381
00:36:20.334 --> 00:36:22.359
Wait a minute,
best take her to the White Queen.

382
00:36:22.436 --> 00:36:25.132
She'll be safe there. Spoon...

383
00:36:27.341 --> 00:36:29.241
Your carriage, milady.

384
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.737
- The hat?
- Of course.

385
00:36:31.812 --> 00:36:33.677
Anyone can go by horse or rail,

386
00:36:33.714 --> 00:36:38.811
but the absolute best way to travel
is by hat. Have I made a rhyme?

387
00:36:39.987 --> 00:36:42.148
Oh, I love traveling by hat.

388
00:36:42.189 --> 00:36:45.386
Mally. Just Alice, please.
Fairfarren, all.

389
00:36:45.693 --> 00:36:47.854
What do you mean? Wait. Gae!

390
00:36:53.467 --> 00:36:59.030
"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe

391
00:36:59.106 --> 00:37:03.008
"All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe"

392
00:37:03.043 --> 00:37:04.874
Sorry, what was that?

393
00:37:05.746 --> 00:37:07.338
What was what?

394
00:37:09.984 --> 00:37:15.286
"The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame
Jaws that bite and claws that catch!

395
00:37:15.356 --> 00:37:19.725
"'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
And the frumious Bandersnatch! '

396
00:37:21.362 --> 00:37:26.857
"He took his Vorpal sword in hand
The Vorpal blade went snicker-snack!

397
00:37:26.901 --> 00:37:32.203
"He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back"

398
00:37:34.508 --> 00:37:36.874
It's all about you, you know.

399
00:37:37.178 --> 00:37:41.740
I'm not slaying anything.
I don't slay, so put it out of your mind.

400
00:37:46.554 --> 00:37:47.816
Mind.

401
00:37:54.595 --> 00:37:56.961
Wait! You can't leave me here!

402
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.795
You don't slay.

403
00:38:02.403 --> 00:38:05.463
Do you have any idea
what the Red Queen has done?

404
00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:07.234
You don't slay.

405
00:38:07.708 --> 00:38:09.835
I couldn't if I wanted to.

406
00:38:12.112 --> 00:38:14.774
You're not the same
as you were before.

407
00:38:15.115 --> 00:38:20.178
You were much more muchier.
You've lost your muchness.

408
00:38:21.088 --> 00:38:22.646
My "muchness"?

409
00:38:23.224 --> 00:38:25.624
In there. Something's missing.

410
00:38:26.227 --> 00:38:28.661
Tell me what Red Queen has done.

411
00:38:31.165 --> 00:38:33.156
It's not a pretty story.

412
00:38:33.801 --> 00:38:35.359
Tell me anyway.

413
00:38:46.981 --> 00:38:48.778
It was here.

414
00:38:49.783 --> 00:38:52.775
I was hatter to the White Queen
at the time.

415
00:38:53.954 --> 00:38:57.287
Hightopp clan have always
been employed at court.

416
00:40:48.869 --> 00:40:51.235
Hatter? Hatter!

417
00:40:52.406 --> 00:40:53.805
I'm fine.

418
00:40:54.742 --> 00:40:56.004
Are you?

419
00:40:58.812 --> 00:41:02.111
Did you hear that?
I'm certain I heard something.

420
00:41:02.916 --> 00:41:03.974
What?

421
00:41:05.152 --> 00:41:06.619
Oh! Red Knights.

422
00:41:42.022 --> 00:41:43.614
Go south to Trotter's Bottom.

423
00:41:43.657 --> 00:41:46.217
The White Queen's castle
is just beyond.

424
00:41:46.293 --> 00:41:47.954
Hold on tightly.

425
00:41:51.698 --> 00:41:54.030
Down with the bloody Red Queen!

426
00:42:54.394 --> 00:42:57.557
You were supposed to lead them away!
The Hatter trusted you!

427
00:42:57.598 --> 00:42:59.725
They have my wife and pups.

428
00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:02.565
- What's your name?
- Bayard.

429
00:43:03.003 --> 00:43:04.061
Sit!

430
00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.434
Would your name be Alice,
by any chance?

431
00:43:09.476 --> 00:43:12.206
Yes, but I'm not the one
that everyone's talking about.

432
00:43:12.246 --> 00:43:15.875
The Hatter would not have
given himself up just for any Alice.

433
00:43:15.916 --> 00:43:17.577
Where did they take him?

434
00:43:17.618 --> 00:43:20.985
To the Red Queen's castle
at Salazen Grum.

435
00:43:21.054 --> 00:43:23.079
We're going to rescue him.

436
00:43:23.123 --> 00:43:24.590
That is not foretold.

437
00:43:24.625 --> 00:43:28.391
I don't care.
He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.

438
00:43:28.428 --> 00:43:31.090
The Frabjous Day is almost upon us.

439
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:33.759
You must prepare
to meet the Jabberwocky.

440
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.734
From the moment
I fell down that rabbit hole,

441
00:43:35.769 --> 00:43:38.602
I've been told what I must do
and who I must be.

442
00:43:38.639 --> 00:43:42.598
I've been shrunk, stretched, scratched
and stuffed into a teapot.

443
00:43:42.676 --> 00:43:46.908
I've been accused of being Alice and
of not being Alice, but this is my dream.

444
00:43:46.947 --> 00:43:49.108
I'll decide where it goes from here.

445
00:43:49.149 --> 00:43:50.946
If you diverge from the path...

446
00:43:50.984 --> 00:43:52.781
I make the path.

447
00:44:03.964 --> 00:44:07.627
Take me to Salazen Grum, Bayard,
and don't forget the hat.

448
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:56.210
There's only one way across.

449
00:45:02.489 --> 00:45:04.719
Lost my muchness, have I?

450
00:45:48.602 --> 00:45:50.297
Bayard! The hat!

451
00:46:20.267 --> 00:46:21.825
Your Majesty.

452
00:46:30.844 --> 00:46:32.311
So sorry.

453
00:46:41.621 --> 00:46:43.111
Splendid shot!

454
00:46:46.426 --> 00:46:48.291
Where's my ball? Page!

455
00:46:48.962 --> 00:46:50.020
Yes, Your Majesty.

456
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.829
I want to help you.

457
00:46:59.973 --> 00:47:02.464
Well, if it isn't the wrong Alice.

458
00:47:03.643 --> 00:47:05.668
What brings you here? Mmm?

459
00:47:05.712 --> 00:47:07.373
I've come to rescue the Hatter.

460
00:47:07.447 --> 00:47:10.143
You're not rescuing anyone
being the size of a gerbil.

461
00:47:10.183 --> 00:47:12.947
Well, do you have any more
of that cake that made me grow before?

462
00:47:12.986 --> 00:47:15.955
Upelkuchen?
Actually, I might have some left.

463
00:47:25.465 --> 00:47:27.057
Not all of it!

464
00:47:27.534 --> 00:47:30.833
Oh, no! Stop! No, no, no, don't.
Don't do that!

465
00:47:32.272 --> 00:47:33.466
Page!

466
00:47:34.808 --> 00:47:36.173
Oh, dear.

467
00:47:41.615 --> 00:47:43.515
And what is this?

468
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:47.646
It... It's a "who," Majesty. This is, um...

469
00:47:49.122 --> 00:47:50.214
Um?

470
00:47:51.291 --> 00:47:53.316
From Umbradge.

471
00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.555
What happened to your clothes?

472
00:47:55.629 --> 00:47:59.827
I outgrew them.
I've been growing an awful lot lately.

473
00:47:59.866 --> 00:48:04.701
I tower over everyone in Umbradge.
They laugh at me.

474
00:48:04.738 --> 00:48:08.037
So I've come to you, hoping you might
understand what it's like.

475
00:48:08.074 --> 00:48:09.598
My dear girl,

476
00:48:09.676 --> 00:48:13.237
anyone with a head that large
is welcome in my court.

477
00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.542
Someone find her some clothes!

478
00:48:14.581 --> 00:48:18.381
Use the curtains if you must,
but clothe this enormous girl.

479
00:48:27.861 --> 00:48:29.556
I need a pig here!

480
00:48:35.202 --> 00:48:38.365
I love a warm pig belly
for my aching feet.

481
00:48:38.405 --> 00:48:41.135
- Would you like one, Um?
- No, thank you.

482
00:48:41.208 --> 00:48:42.470
Sit!

483
00:48:44.878 --> 00:48:46.106
Sit!

484
00:48:49.749 --> 00:48:51.046
Go away.

485
00:48:54.221 --> 00:48:57.247
Where are my fat boys?
You must meet them.

486
00:48:57.357 --> 00:48:58.619
Fat boys!

487
00:49:01.027 --> 00:49:04.394
Oh. There they are.
Aren't they adorable?

488
00:49:04.431 --> 00:49:08.265
They have the oddest way of speaking.
Speak, boys. Amuse us.

489
00:49:09.302 --> 00:49:11.065
Go on.

490
00:49:13.874 --> 00:49:15.068
No.

491
00:49:15.108 --> 00:49:16.268
Speak!

492
00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:20.646
- Is that being...
- No, no, it isn't. Not a bit. No.

493
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.477
Contrariwise, I believe it's so.

494
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:24.574
No, it ain't so, nohow!

495
00:49:27.954 --> 00:49:30.752
I love my fat boys. Now, get out.

496
00:49:39.266 --> 00:49:41.791
- He did pinch me.
- He did pinch me.

497
00:50:00.453 --> 00:50:04.219
And who is this lovely creature?

498
00:50:07.027 --> 00:50:08.654
Um, my new favorite.

499
00:50:08.695 --> 00:50:10.526
- Well, does she have a name?
- Um.

500
00:50:10.597 --> 00:50:13.794
I believe your name
has slipped the Queen's mind.

501
00:50:13.833 --> 00:50:15.892
Her name is Um, idiot!

502
00:50:17.704 --> 00:50:19.399
From Umbradge.

503
00:50:19.472 --> 00:50:21.064
Any luck with the prisoner?

504
00:50:21.141 --> 00:50:22.699
He's stubborn.

505
00:50:23.643 --> 00:50:26.874
You're too soft. Bring him!

506
00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:53.337
We know Alice has returned
to Underland.

507
00:50:53.373 --> 00:50:55.364
Do you know where she is?

508
00:50:57.344 --> 00:51:01.110
I've been considering things
that begin with the letter "M."

509
00:51:01.614 --> 00:51:08.383
Moron, mutiny, murder, malice.

510
00:51:08.655 --> 00:51:11.954
We're looking for an "A" word now.
Where is Alice?

511
00:51:13.026 --> 00:51:16.393
Who, that wee little boy?
I wouldn't know.

512
00:51:17.564 --> 00:51:19.623
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?

513
00:51:21.534 --> 00:51:22.899
Stop that.

514
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:27.033
What a regrettably large head
you have.

515
00:51:27.073 --> 00:51:29.234
I should very much like to hat it.

516
00:51:29.275 --> 00:51:30.765
- Hat it?
- Yes.

517
00:51:31.411 --> 00:51:33.675
I used to hat
the White Queen, you know.

518
00:51:33.747 --> 00:51:35.578
Wasn't very much to work with,
poor dear.

519
00:51:35.615 --> 00:51:37.412
Her head is so small.

520
00:51:37.751 --> 00:51:40.151
It's tiny. It's a pimple of a head.

521
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.585
But this...

522
00:51:42.288 --> 00:51:48.386
What I could do
with this monument, this orb...

523
00:51:48.895 --> 00:51:53.764
Nay, this magnificently heroic globe.

524
00:51:57.404 --> 00:51:59.099
What could you do?

525
00:52:00.974 --> 00:52:02.771
Unbind him, Stayne.

526
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:06.005
How can he work
if his hands are bound?

527
00:52:14.487 --> 00:52:17.513
Well, then,
shall it be a bonnet or a boater?

528
00:52:18.425 --> 00:52:20.620
Or something for the boudoir?

529
00:52:21.428 --> 00:52:27.663
Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif,
snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke,

530
00:52:27.734 --> 00:52:31.101
cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter,
billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau,

531
00:52:31.137 --> 00:52:32.764
bongrace, fan-tail, night cap,
Garibaldi, fez...

532
00:52:32.806 --> 00:52:34.034
Hatter.

533
00:52:34.574 --> 00:52:35.632
Fez?

534
00:52:39.846 --> 00:52:41.177
Leave us.

535
00:52:53.827 --> 00:52:55.351
The trees seem sad.

536
00:52:55.428 --> 00:52:58.397
- Have you been speaking with them?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

537
00:52:58.465 --> 00:53:00.524
Perhaps a bit more kindly.

538
00:53:03.636 --> 00:53:06.799
Would you all excuse me
for a moment? Thank you.

539
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:21.018
- What news, Bayard?
- Alice has returned to Underland.

540
00:53:21.788 --> 00:53:24.882
- Where is she now?
- In Salazen Grum.

541
00:53:25.492 --> 00:53:29.519
Forgive me. I allowed her
to divert from her destined path.

542
00:53:29.562 --> 00:53:34.261
No, no, no, no. But that is exactly
where she will find the Vorpal sword.

543
00:53:35.068 --> 00:53:38.765
We have our champion.
Rest now. You've done well.

544
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:59.556
Have you seen
a hat around here?

545
00:54:12.872 --> 00:54:14.703
You must find Alice, Stayne.

546
00:54:14.741 --> 00:54:15.799
Without the Jabberwocky,

547
00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:19.140
my sister's followers
will surely rise against me.

548
00:54:20.046 --> 00:54:23.277
Ugly little sister.
Why do they adore her and not me?

549
00:54:23.616 --> 00:54:30.078
I cannot fathom it.
You are far superior in all ways.

550
00:54:30.423 --> 00:54:31.890
I know.

551
00:54:31.925 --> 00:54:34.985
But Mirana can make anyone
fall in love with her.

552
00:54:35.061 --> 00:54:37.222
Men, women,

553
00:54:41.434 --> 00:54:43.231
even the furniture.

554
00:54:45.138 --> 00:54:46.969
Even the King?

555
00:54:54.414 --> 00:54:57.178
I had to do it. He would have left me.

556
00:54:59.586 --> 00:55:06.116
Majesty, is it not better
to be feared than loved?

557
00:55:08.328 --> 00:55:10.159
Not certain anymore.

558
00:55:11.931 --> 00:55:15.128
Oh, let her have the rabble.
I don't need them.

559
00:55:15.835 --> 00:55:17.268
I have you.

560
00:55:36.923 --> 00:55:38.550
They're wonderful.

561
00:55:40.426 --> 00:55:42.690
You must let me try one on.

562
00:55:42.762 --> 00:55:45.663
It is good to be working
at my trade again.

563
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.128
It's just a pity
you have to make them for her.

564
00:55:54.807 --> 00:55:57.002
What is the hatter with me?

565
00:55:58.311 --> 00:55:59.539
Hatter?

566
00:56:10.556 --> 00:56:11.853
Hatter.

567
00:56:13.693 --> 00:56:17.094
Have you any idea
why a raven is like a writing desk?

568
00:56:18.131 --> 00:56:19.928
I'm frightened, Alice.

569
00:56:20.199 --> 00:56:23.327
I don't like it in here.
It's terribly crowded.

570
00:56:26.739 --> 00:56:28.366
Have I gone mad?

571
00:56:33.179 --> 00:56:36.410
I'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers.

572
00:56:38.151 --> 00:56:41.951
But I'll tell you a secret.
All the best people are.

573
00:56:49.729 --> 00:56:50.889
Here.

574
00:56:54.334 --> 00:56:57.098
That's better. You look yourself again.

575
00:57:00.206 --> 00:57:01.969
Hat man!
Where are my hats?

576
00:57:02.041 --> 00:57:03.736
I'm not a patient monarch!

577
00:57:03.776 --> 00:57:06.336
I'm told she keeps the Vorpal sword
hidden in the castle.

578
00:57:06.412 --> 00:57:08.277
The rabbit will help you.

579
00:57:08.314 --> 00:57:11.579
Find it, Alice.
Take it to the White Queen.

580
00:57:11.617 --> 00:57:13.551
We'll go to the White Queen together.

581
00:57:13.586 --> 00:57:17.420
Why is it you're always too small
or too tall?

582
00:57:30.236 --> 00:57:31.965
- Tweedles.
- Alice.

583
00:57:32.038 --> 00:57:34.302
- How do you do, again?
- Where's the rabbit?

584
00:57:34.374 --> 00:57:36.308
How is it you're being so great big?

585
00:57:36.342 --> 00:57:38.537
She ain't great big,
this is how she normal is.

586
00:57:38.611 --> 00:57:40.772
I'm certain she's smaller when we met.

587
00:57:40.813 --> 00:57:44.613
No, she drank the pishsalver
to get through the door, recall it?

588
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:45.742
Oh, yeah.

589
00:57:45.785 --> 00:57:47.685
- Where's the rabbit?
- Over theres.

590
00:57:56.996 --> 00:57:59.590
- What are you doing here?
- I'm rescuing the Hatter.

591
00:57:59.632 --> 00:58:01.099
I'm rescuing the Hatter.

592
00:58:01.134 --> 00:58:04.934
He told me that the Vorpal sword
is hidden in the castle. Help me find it.

593
00:58:04.971 --> 00:58:07.872
I don't take orders
from big, clumsy, galumphing...

594
00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.032
Shoo!

595
00:58:13.179 --> 00:58:16.774
- What is it, McTwisp?
- I know where the sword is.

596
00:58:23.322 --> 00:58:25.381
The sword's hidden inside.

597
00:58:26.993 --> 00:58:28.790
Be careful, Alice.

598
00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:40.166
I know that smell.

599
00:58:49.515 --> 00:58:51.483
I'm not going in there.

600
00:58:52.485 --> 00:58:54.919
Look what that thing did to my arm.

601
00:58:54.987 --> 00:58:58.684
Dear, oh, dear.
Why haven't you mentioned this?

602
00:58:58.724 --> 00:59:00.749
It wasn't this bad before.

603
00:59:16.409 --> 00:59:19.901
Hatter? Where are you?

604
00:59:21.781 --> 00:59:23.043
Hatter?

605
00:59:23.983 --> 00:59:25.041
Mallymkun.

606
00:59:25.985 --> 00:59:28.385
Do you still have
the Bandersnatch eye?

607
00:59:28.421 --> 00:59:29.786
Right here.

608
00:59:30.523 --> 00:59:32.855
- I need it.
- Come and get it.

609
00:59:34.894 --> 00:59:36.589
Hey! Give it back!

610
00:59:49.275 --> 00:59:50.833
I like you, Um.

611
00:59:52.712 --> 00:59:54.907
I like largeness.

612
00:59:56.182 --> 00:59:57.911
Get away from me.

613
01:00:15.301 --> 01:00:16.962
I have your eye.

614
01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:31.001
No.

615
01:01:34.013 --> 01:01:35.071
Hmm.

616
01:01:35.147 --> 01:01:37.411
You look stunning in that hat.

617
01:01:37.483 --> 01:01:39.314
Yes. Next.

618
01:01:43.222 --> 01:01:45.850
Your Majesty has never looked better.

619
01:01:46.359 --> 01:01:48.020
Hmm. Another.

620
01:01:55.835 --> 01:01:56.893
Oh!

621
01:01:58.704 --> 01:02:00.729
I don't wish to alarm you,

622
01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.401
but it smells as though
you might have dropped something.

623
01:02:16.656 --> 01:02:19.216
Never mind him, he's mad.
Come along.

624
01:02:25.364 --> 01:02:28.265
Stayne!

625
01:03:22.421 --> 01:03:24.912
I suppose this makes us even now.

626
01:04:05.364 --> 01:04:06.831
Um forced herself on me.

627
01:04:06.866 --> 01:04:13.362
I told her my heart belongs to you,
but she's obsessed with me.

628
01:04:19.145 --> 01:04:20.840
Off with her head!

629
01:04:23.849 --> 01:04:26.010
Stand back, Mallymkun.

630
01:04:26.051 --> 01:04:27.382
How's this for muchness?

631
01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:29.148
No, no!
It mustn't be used for anything...

632
01:04:31.323 --> 01:04:34.224
Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!

633
01:04:35.027 --> 01:04:36.324
Hatter!

634
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:40.562
- Take it to the White Queen.
- I'm not leaving without you.

635
01:04:40.633 --> 01:04:41.827
Go!

636
01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.987
Run, Alice!

637
01:05:13.199 --> 01:05:14.393
Alice?

638
01:05:15.601 --> 01:05:16.727
Run!

639
01:05:22.441 --> 01:05:23.806
Seize her.

640
01:05:35.521 --> 01:05:36.715
Alice.

641
01:05:37.957 --> 01:05:40.255
Of course. Why didn't I see it?

642
01:05:40.292 --> 01:05:45.992
Well, it has been a long time,
and you were such a little tyke then.

643
01:05:47.032 --> 01:05:50.433
- Give me the sword.
- Stay back.

644
01:05:50.469 --> 01:05:52.596
The Queen will be so pleased.

645
01:05:52.638 --> 01:05:56.438
She will take great pleasure
in taking off your head.

646
01:06:17.096 --> 01:06:20.793
- Oh, Alice!
- Bayard! To Marmoreal.

647
01:06:29.174 --> 01:06:32.302
Majesty, Alice has escaped

648
01:06:36.348 --> 01:06:39.010
on the Bandersnatch,

649
01:06:41.453 --> 01:06:44.149
with the Vorpal sword.

650
01:06:47.293 --> 01:06:49.557
How could you let this happen?

651
01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:56.129
I may have underestimated her,
but we have her conspirators,

652
01:06:56.535 --> 01:07:00.665
the Hatter and a dormouse.

653
01:07:01.373 --> 01:07:02.704
Off with their heads!

654
01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:23.691
Welcome to Marmoreal.

655
01:07:23.729 --> 01:07:25.890
I believe this belongs to you.

656
01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:34.499
Mmm.

657
01:07:39.411 --> 01:07:41.879
The Vorpal sword is home again.

658
01:07:44.316 --> 01:07:46.250
The armor is complete.

659
01:07:49.588 --> 01:07:52.716
Now all we need is a champion.

660
01:07:54.526 --> 01:07:57.017
You're a little taller
than I thought you'd be.

661
01:07:57.062 --> 01:07:59.428
Blame it on too much upelkuchen.

662
01:07:59.498 --> 01:08:00.760
Oh.

663
01:08:00.799 --> 01:08:02.289
Come with me.

664
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.398
Is the March Hare here?

665
01:08:09.441 --> 01:08:12.933
You're late
for your soup, you wee besom.

666
01:08:13.012 --> 01:08:14.741
- You're late for your soup.
- Could use some salt.

667
01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.941
Come here, you!

668
01:08:17.616 --> 01:08:19.777
Give me that here.
Choppy, chop, chop, chop.

669
01:08:19.852 --> 01:08:21.581
Leek and potato. Yes. That would be...

670
01:08:23.122 --> 01:08:26.580
Pishsalver. Let me think.

671
01:08:27.192 --> 01:08:29.717
A pinch of worm fat,

672
01:08:31.563 --> 01:08:33.588
urine of the horsefly,

673
01:08:35.634 --> 01:08:37.329
buttered fingers.

674
01:08:42.307 --> 01:08:47.677
My sister preferred to study
Dominion Over Living Things.

675
01:08:49.882 --> 01:08:52.510
Tell me, how does she seem to you?

676
01:08:52.584 --> 01:08:54.279
Perfectly horrid.

677
01:08:55.921 --> 01:08:59.948
- And her head?
- Bulbous.

678
01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:04.121
I think she may have
some kind of growth in there,

679
01:09:04.163 --> 01:09:06.495
something pressing on her brain.

680
01:09:06.532 --> 01:09:11.970
Three coins from a dead man's pocket,
two teaspoons of wishful thinking.

681
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:15.872
You can't imagine the things
that go on in that place.

682
01:09:15.941 --> 01:09:17.306
Oh, yes, I can.

683
01:09:18.277 --> 01:09:23.214
But when a champion steps forth
to slay the Jabberwocky,

684
01:09:23.282 --> 01:09:25.682
the people will rise against her.

685
01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.315
That should do it.

686
01:09:33.759 --> 01:09:34.851
Blow.

687
01:09:49.308 --> 01:09:51.902
- Feel better?
- Much, thank you.

688
01:09:51.977 --> 01:09:54.343
There's someone here
who would like to speak with you.

689
01:10:15.067 --> 01:10:17.501
- Absolem?
- Who are you?

690
01:10:22.074 --> 01:10:26.511
I thought we'd settled this.
I'm Alice, but not that one.

691
01:10:27.012 --> 01:10:30.004
- How do you know?
- You said so yourself.

692
01:10:30.048 --> 01:10:32.414
I said you were not hardly Alice,

693
01:10:32.484 --> 01:10:34.042
but you're much more her now.

694
01:10:34.086 --> 01:10:37.021
In fact, you're almost Alice.

695
01:10:37.656 --> 01:10:39.055
Even so,

696
01:10:39.091 --> 01:10:42.026
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky
if my life depended on it.

697
01:10:42.327 --> 01:10:43.589
It will.

698
01:10:44.696 --> 01:10:47.324
So I suggest
you keep the Vorpal sword on hand

699
01:10:47.399 --> 01:10:50.129
when the Frabjous Day arrives.

700
01:10:50.202 --> 01:10:51.897
You seem so real.

701
01:10:52.905 --> 01:10:55.897
Sometimes I forget
that this is all a dream.

702
01:10:58.577 --> 01:11:00.568
Will you stop doing that?

703
01:11:19.798 --> 01:11:22.266
I've always admired that hat.

704
01:11:23.635 --> 01:11:25.398
Hello, Chess.

705
01:11:25.437 --> 01:11:28.167
Since you won't be needing it
anymore,

706
01:11:29.575 --> 01:11:32.442
would you consider
bequeathing it to me?

707
01:11:32.477 --> 01:11:33.967
How dare you?

708
01:11:34.413 --> 01:11:38.349
It is a formal execution.
I would like to look my best, you know.

709
01:11:38.617 --> 01:11:40.778
It is a pity about all this.

710
01:11:40.819 --> 01:11:44.016
I was looking forward
to seeing you Futterwacken.

711
01:11:44.756 --> 01:11:47.088
I was rather good at it, was I not?

712
01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:50.117
I really do love that hat.

713
01:11:51.597 --> 01:11:54.464
I would wear it
to all the finest occasions.

714
01:12:02.174 --> 01:12:04.335
I love a morning execution, don't you?

715
01:12:04.409 --> 01:12:07.003
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

716
01:12:49.621 --> 01:12:52.419
- I'd like to keep it on.
- Suit yourself.

717
01:12:53.125 --> 01:12:55.593
As long as I can get at your neck.

718
01:12:57.529 --> 01:12:59.360
I'm right behind you.

719
01:13:00.098 --> 01:13:01.258
Off with his head!

720
01:13:01.466 --> 01:13:02.990
I can't watch.

721
01:13:36.535 --> 01:13:38.435
Good morning, everyone.

722
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:41.361
Chess, you dog.

723
01:13:43.775 --> 01:13:44.901
Madam,

724
01:13:44.943 --> 01:13:46.604
you are being heinously bamboozled

725
01:13:46.678 --> 01:13:50.307
by these lickspittle toadies
you surround yourselves with.

726
01:13:54.786 --> 01:13:55.878
What is that?

727
01:13:55.921 --> 01:13:58.219
I'm not the only one, Majesty. Look!

728
01:13:58.256 --> 01:14:00.247
A counterfeit nose.
You should be ashamed.

729
01:14:00.292 --> 01:14:03.853
Me? What about that big belly
you're so proud of?

730
01:14:08.767 --> 01:14:13.329
Liars! Cheats! Falsifiers!

731
01:14:13.772 --> 01:14:15.603
Off with their heads!

732
01:14:20.445 --> 01:14:23.676
The abused and enslaved
in the Red Queen's court,

733
01:14:24.216 --> 01:14:26.741
all of you stand up and fight!

734
01:14:27.386 --> 01:14:29.980
Rise up against the bloody Red Queen.

735
01:14:32.824 --> 01:14:35.224
<i>- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!
- Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!</i>

736
01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.858
Release the Jubjub Bird!

737
01:15:08.493 --> 01:15:10.256
You're right, Stayne,

738
01:15:10.796 --> 01:15:13.594
it is far better to be feared than loved.

739
01:15:17.702 --> 01:15:19.636
Come, boys. Quickly! Come on!

740
01:15:23.475 --> 01:15:24.635
Hatter!

741
01:15:24.676 --> 01:15:27.509
Come on, Mally, quickly.
Come on. Come on.

742
01:15:29.314 --> 01:15:34.149
Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.
We're going to visit my little sister.

743
01:15:44.529 --> 01:15:47.157
I had hoped
to have a champion by now.

744
01:15:49.701 --> 01:15:52.067
Why don't you slay
the Jabberwocky yourself?

745
01:15:52.137 --> 01:15:53.832
You must have the power.

746
01:15:53.872 --> 01:15:57.103
It is against my vows
to harm any living creature.

747
01:16:06.418 --> 01:16:08.010
We have company.

748
01:16:17.863 --> 01:16:19.626
Have a look, Bayard.

749
01:16:22.567 --> 01:16:23.898
Bielle.

750
01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:34.041
I'm so happy to see you.
I thought they were going to...

751
01:16:34.079 --> 01:16:37.742
So did I. But they didn't,
and now here I am, still in one piece.

752
01:16:37.782 --> 01:16:40.774
And I'm rather glad about that
now that I'm seeing you again.

753
01:16:40.852 --> 01:16:42.581
I would have regretted
not seeing you again,

754
01:16:42.621 --> 01:16:45.590
especially now that you're you,
and the proper size.

755
01:16:45.757 --> 01:16:48.658
And it's a good size. It's a great size.
It's a right proper Alice size!

756
01:16:48.727 --> 01:16:52.595
- Hatter.
- Size. Fez. I'm fine.

757
01:16:52.664 --> 01:16:54.325
Where's your hat?

758
01:16:57.636 --> 01:16:58.933
Mmm.

759
01:17:00.105 --> 01:17:02.733
- Cheshire.
- How's the arm, love?

760
01:17:03.742 --> 01:17:04.936
All healed.

761
01:17:04.976 --> 01:17:07.638
Goodbye, sweet hat.

762
01:17:27.299 --> 01:17:31.326
Have you any idea
why a raven is like a writing desk?

763
01:17:34.272 --> 01:17:36.263
Let me think about it.

764
01:17:37.609 --> 01:17:40.203
You know what tomorrow is, don't you?

765
01:17:43.481 --> 01:17:45.972
Frabjous Day. How could I forget?

766
01:17:47.185 --> 01:17:48.880
Wish I'd wake up.

767
01:17:50.589 --> 01:17:54.218
- Still believe this is a dream, do you?
- Of course.

768
01:17:55.527 --> 01:17:58.155
This has all come from my own mind.

769
01:18:00.632 --> 01:18:04.068
Which would mean that I'm not real.

770
01:18:07.772 --> 01:18:12.300
Afraid so.
You're just a figment of my imagination.

771
01:18:13.645 --> 01:18:16.341
I would dream up someone
who's half-mad.

772
01:18:17.115 --> 01:18:20.812
Yes, yes. But you would have to be
half-mad to dream me up.

773
01:18:24.456 --> 01:18:26.117
I must be, then.

774
01:18:31.029 --> 01:18:33.293
I'll miss you when I wake up.

775
01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.416
Who will step forth to be champion
for the White Queen?

776
01:18:53.852 --> 01:18:55.683
That would be I.

777
01:18:57.322 --> 01:19:02.225
You have very poor evaporating skills.
I should be the one.

778
01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:03.452
I'll do it.

779
01:19:03.895 --> 01:19:08.059
- No, me.
- No, me.

780
01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:27.345
No other slayer, nohow.

781
01:19:27.419 --> 01:19:29.853
If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead.

782
01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:40.490
Alice, you cannot live your life
to please others.

783
01:19:41.099 --> 01:19:43.363
The choice must be yours,

784
01:19:44.169 --> 01:19:47.297
because when you step out
to face that creature,

785
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.865
you will step out alone.

786
01:20:24.943 --> 01:20:28.106
Nothing was ever accomplished
with tears.

787
01:20:30.081 --> 01:20:31.412
Absolem?

788
01:20:32.717 --> 01:20:34.582
Why are you upside down?

789
01:20:34.619 --> 01:20:37.144
I've come to the end of this life.

790
01:20:38.022 --> 01:20:41.617
- You're going to die?
- Transform.

791
01:20:41.659 --> 01:20:45.220
Don't go. I need your help.
I don't know what to do.

792
01:20:46.097 --> 01:20:49.191
I can't help you if you don't even know
who you are, stupid girl.

793
01:20:49.267 --> 01:20:50.825
I'm not stupid.

794
01:20:51.603 --> 01:20:54.128
My name is Alice. I live in London.

795
01:20:54.172 --> 01:20:57.164
I have a mother named Helen
and a sister named Margaret.

796
01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:59.369
My father was Charles Kingsleigh.

797
01:20:59.444 --> 01:21:01.503
He had a vision that stretched
halfway around the world,

798
01:21:01.546 --> 01:21:03.571
and nothing ever stopped him.

799
01:21:03.648 --> 01:21:06.446
I'm his daughter. I'm Alice Kingsleigh.

800
01:21:06.951 --> 01:21:10.216
Alice, at last.

801
01:21:10.889 --> 01:21:12.914
You were just as dim-witted
the first time you were here.

802
01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:15.755
You called it "Wonderland," as I recall.

803
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:20.063
Wonderland.

804
01:21:21.366 --> 01:21:24.893
- What do you call yourself?
- Alice.

805
01:21:24.969 --> 01:21:26.664
The Alice?

806
01:21:26.704 --> 01:21:29.901
Then I'll take you to the Hare
and the Hatter, but that's the end of it.

807
01:21:29.974 --> 01:21:31.999
<i>McTWISP: She's the right one.
I'm certain of it.</i>

808
01:21:32.043 --> 01:21:34.511
Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please.

809
01:21:34.546 --> 01:21:35.740
Have some tea.

810
01:21:35.814 --> 01:21:38.339
<i>You're not Absolem,
I'm Absolem, stupid girl.</i>

811
01:21:39.884 --> 01:21:42.011
- What is this?
- I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.

812
01:21:42.053 --> 01:21:44.544
Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,
he's Tweedledee.

813
01:21:44.589 --> 01:21:46.887
<i>You'd think she would
remember all this from the first time.</i>

814
01:21:46.925 --> 01:21:48.859
<i>Curiouser and curiouser.</i>

815
01:21:49.561 --> 01:21:52.689
It wasn't a dream at all,
it was a memory.

816
01:21:53.598 --> 01:21:57.557
This place is real,
and so are you and so is the Hatter.

817
01:21:57.836 --> 01:22:00.270
And the Jabberwocky.

818
01:22:01.172 --> 01:22:04.573
Remember, the Vorpal sword
knows what it wants.

819
01:22:04.609 --> 01:22:07.442
All you have to do is hold on to it.

820
01:22:09.948 --> 01:22:15.477
Fairfarren, Alice.
Perhaps I will see you in another life.

821
01:24:15.473 --> 01:24:20.001
- Hello, Iracebeth.
- Hello, Mirana.

822
01:24:23.314 --> 01:24:28.377
On this, the Frabjous Day,
the Queens Red and White

823
01:24:28.419 --> 01:24:33.118
shall send forth their champions
to do battle on their behalf.

824
01:24:34.325 --> 01:24:37.590
Oh, Racie. We don't have to fight.

825
01:24:40.064 --> 01:24:42.123
I know what you're doing.

826
01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.563
You think you can blink
those pretty little eyes

827
01:24:45.603 --> 01:24:48.629
and I'll melt,
just like Mummy and Daddy did.

828
01:24:50.708 --> 01:24:51.936
Please.

829
01:24:53.444 --> 01:24:58.472
No! It is my crown! I am the eldest!

830
01:24:59.183 --> 01:25:00.673
Jabberwocky!

831
01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:49.963
This is impossible.

832
01:25:50.835 --> 01:25:52.860
Only if you believe it is.

833
01:25:58.743 --> 01:26:03.771
Sometimes I believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast.

834
01:26:04.749 --> 01:26:06.910
That is an excellent practice.

835
01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:11.848
However, just at the moment,

836
01:26:13.424 --> 01:26:16.291
you really might want
to focus on the Jabberwocky.

837
01:26:22.533 --> 01:26:24.831
Where's your champion, Sister?

838
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:27.464
Here.

839
01:26:29.774 --> 01:26:31.139
Hello, Um.

840
01:26:45.223 --> 01:26:48.351
Six impossible things.
Count them, Alice.

841
01:26:52.964 --> 01:26:56.058
One, there's a potion
that can make you shrink.

842
01:26:59.637 --> 01:27:02.367
Two, and a cake
that can make you grow.

843
01:27:02.907 --> 01:27:09.403
So, my old foe,
we meet on the battlefield once again.

844
01:27:10.648 --> 01:27:12.047
We've never met.

845
01:27:12.083 --> 01:27:14.483
Not you, insignificant bearer.

846
01:27:15.353 --> 01:27:19.881
My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one.

847
01:27:21.192 --> 01:27:23.092
That's enough chatter.

848
01:27:30.001 --> 01:27:32.595
Three, animals can talk.

849
01:27:38.342 --> 01:27:39.809
Four, Alice,

850
01:27:42.213 --> 01:27:44.078
cats can disappear.

851
01:27:46.584 --> 01:27:47.744
Five,

852
01:27:50.821 --> 01:27:53.312
there's a place called Wonderland.

853
01:27:54.158 --> 01:27:55.318
Six,

854
01:27:56.093 --> 01:27:58.061
I can slay the Jabberwocky.

855
01:28:23.588 --> 01:28:26.523
The Hatter's interfering!
Off with his head!

856
01:30:53.304 --> 01:30:55.101
Off with your head!

857
01:31:27.738 --> 01:31:29.763
Kill her!

858
01:31:29.807 --> 01:31:32.469
We follow you no more,
Bloody Big Head.

859
01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:35.170
How dare you? Off with his head!

860
01:32:17.188 --> 01:32:22.524
Iracebeth of Crims, your crimes
against Underland are worthy of death.

861
01:32:24.528 --> 01:32:28.089
However, that is against my vows,

862
01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.834
therefore, you are banished
to the Outlands.

863
01:32:32.303 --> 01:32:36.262
No one is to show you any kindness,
or ever speak a word to you.

864
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:42.143
You will not have a friend in the world.

865
01:32:43.781 --> 01:32:48.218
Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will.

866
01:32:51.856 --> 01:32:54.484
Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne,

867
01:32:54.558 --> 01:32:56.549
you are to join Iracebeth in banishment

868
01:32:56.594 --> 01:32:59.392
from this day
until the end of Underland.

869
01:33:02.266 --> 01:33:04.461
At least we have each other.

870
01:33:17.548 --> 01:33:21.951
Majesty, please! Kill me! Please!

871
01:33:22.653 --> 01:33:24.951
But I do not owe you a kindness.

872
01:33:24.989 --> 01:33:27.958
- Take off my head!
- He tried to kill me.

873
01:33:27.992 --> 01:33:31.257
- Majesty! Please! Please!
- He tried to kill me.

874
01:33:31.295 --> 01:33:33.263
- I offer you my head!
- He tried to kill me!

875
01:33:33.297 --> 01:33:36.596
Oh, the Frabjous Day! Callou! Callay!

876
01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.268
- What is he doing?
- Futterwacken.

877
01:34:32.890 --> 01:34:37.691
Blood of the Jabberwocky.
You have our everlasting gratitude.

878
01:34:38.062 --> 01:34:40.622
And for your efforts on our behalf...

879
01:34:44.868 --> 01:34:48.235
- Will this take me home?
- If that is what you choose.

880
01:35:14.698 --> 01:35:16.290
You could stay.

881
01:35:19.637 --> 01:35:23.573
What an idea.
A crazy, mad, wonderful idea.

882
01:35:29.546 --> 01:35:31.013
But I can't.

883
01:35:32.416 --> 01:35:36.477
There are questions I have to answer,
things I have to do.

884
01:35:45.095 --> 01:35:47.495
Be back again before you know it.

885
01:35:49.133 --> 01:35:50.998
You won't remember me.

886
01:35:51.769 --> 01:35:54.499
Of course I will. How could I forget?

887
01:35:59.309 --> 01:36:03.268
Hatter, why is a raven
like a writing desk?

888
01:36:05.582 --> 01:36:07.846
I haven't the slightest idea.

889
01:36:13.023 --> 01:36:14.786
Fairfarren, Alice.

890
01:37:01.905 --> 01:37:04.931
She left me standing there
without an answer.

891
01:37:05.008 --> 01:37:07.169
A case of nerves, no doubt.

892
01:37:10.147 --> 01:37:12.547
- Alice.
- Good Lord.

893
01:37:13.383 --> 01:37:15.681
- Are you all right?
- What happened to you?

894
01:37:15.719 --> 01:37:18.779
I fell down a hole and hit my head.

895
01:37:19.056 --> 01:37:23.550
I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.
You're not the right man for me.

896
01:37:25.062 --> 01:37:28.054
And there's that trouble
with your digestion.

897
01:37:29.066 --> 01:37:33.594
I love you, Margaret, but this is my life.
I'll decide what to do with it.

898
01:37:36.974 --> 01:37:40.466
You're lucky to have my sister
for your wife, Lowell,

899
01:37:40.544 --> 01:37:44.275
and you be good to her.
I'll be watching very closely.

900
01:37:46.784 --> 01:37:49.275
There is no prince, Aunt Imogene.

901
01:37:49.353 --> 01:37:52.550
You need to talk to someone
about these delusions.

902
01:37:54.925 --> 01:37:58.088
I happen to love rabbits,
especially white ones.

903
01:38:01.031 --> 01:38:02.293
Don't worry, Mother,

904
01:38:02.366 --> 01:38:05.335
I'll find something useful
to do with my life.

905
01:38:07.437 --> 01:38:10.929
You two remind me of some funny boys
I met in a dream.

906
01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:16.145
- You've left me out.
- No, I haven't, sir.

907
01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:19.642
You and I have business to discuss.

908
01:38:19.716 --> 01:38:21.911
Shall we speak in the study?

909
01:38:28.625 --> 01:38:30.820
Oh. And one more thing.

910
01:38:39.002 --> 01:38:43.871
My father told me he planned to expand
his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo,

911
01:38:43.941 --> 01:38:46.501
but I don't think
he was looking far enough.

912
01:38:46.543 --> 01:38:48.841
Why not go all the way to China?

913
01:38:49.646 --> 01:38:53.980
It's vast, the culture is rich,
and we have a foothold in Hong Kong.

914
01:38:54.785 --> 01:38:58.346
To be the first to trade with China,
can you imagine it?

915
01:39:00.324 --> 01:39:01.985
You know, if anybody else
had said that to me,

916
01:39:02.025 --> 01:39:04.960
I'd say, "You've lost your senses".

917
01:39:05.162 --> 01:39:07.357
But I've seen that look before.

918
01:39:07.497 --> 01:39:11.991
Well, as you're not going to be
my daughter-in-law,

919
01:39:12.035 --> 01:39:15.994
perhaps you'd consider becoming
an apprentice with the company.

920
01:39:55.879 --> 01:39:57.540
Hello, Absolem.

921
01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:16.766
<i>Tripping out, spinning around</i>

922
01:40:16.833 --> 01:40:21.793
<i>I'm underground
I fell down</i>

923
01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:26.068
<i>Yeah, I fell down</i>

924
01:40:28.979 --> 01:40:32.972
<i>I'm freaking out
Where am I now?</i>

925
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:39.614
<i>Upside down and I can't stop it now</i>

926
01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:44.652
<i>Can't stop me now</i>

927
01:40:49.399 --> 01:40:55.998
<i>I, I'll get by</i>

928
01:40:57.474 --> 01:41:04.209
<i>I, I'll survive</i>

929
01:41:05.782 --> 01:41:09.741
<i>When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground</i>

930
01:41:09.786 --> 01:41:13.517
<i>I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me</i>

931
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:20.291
<i>I, I won't cry</i>

932
01:41:23.433 --> 01:41:30.464
<i>I found myself in Wonderland</i>

933
01:41:31.708 --> 01:41:38.511
<i>Get back on my feet, the ground</i>

934
01:41:40.517 --> 01:41:44.317
<i>Is this real?</i>

935
01:41:44.354 --> 01:41:47.551
<i>Is it pretend?</i>

936
01:41:47.624 --> 01:41:54.530
<i>I'll take a stand until the end</i>

937
01:41:57.968 --> 01:42:04.567
<i>I, I'll get by</i>

938
01:42:06.043 --> 01:42:12.778
<i>I, I'll survive</i>

939
01:42:14.284 --> 01:42:18.380
<i>When the world's crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground</i>

940
01:42:18.455 --> 01:42:22.152
<i>I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me</i>

941
01:42:22.192 --> 01:42:28.893
<i>I, I won't cry</i>

942
01:43:11.875 --> 01:43:16.710
<i>Oh, Alice, dear, where have you been?</i>

943
01:43:19.749 --> 01:43:24.516
<i>So near, so far, so in between</i>

944
01:43:27.824 --> 01:43:32.284
<i>What have you heard?
What have you seen?</i>

945
01:43:32.329 --> 01:43:37.130
<i>Alice, Alice, please, Alice</i>

946
01:43:44.074 --> 01:43:48.773
<i>Oh, tell us, are you big or small?</i>

947
01:43:51.848 --> 01:43:56.376
<i>To try this one or try them all</i>

948
01:43:59.756 --> 01:44:04.352
<i>It's such a long, long way to fall</i>

949
01:44:04.394 --> 01:44:09.127
<i>Alice, Alice, oh, Alice</i>

950
01:44:16.339 --> 01:44:18.204
<i>How can you know this way, not that?</i>

951
01:44:18.241 --> 01:44:20.232
<i>You choose the door
You choose the path</i>

952
01:44:20.277 --> 01:44:22.245
<i>Perhaps you should be coming back</i>

953
01:44:22.279 --> 01:44:24.076
<i>Another day, another day</i>

954
01:44:24.114 --> 01:44:26.207
<i>And nothing is quite what it seems</i>

955
01:44:26.249 --> 01:44:28.046
<i>You're dreaming
Are you dreaming?</i>

956
01:44:28.084 --> 01:44:29.415
<i>Oh, Alice</i>

957
01:44:36.927 --> 01:44:40.954
<i>Oh, Alice</i>

958
01:44:44.467 --> 01:44:48.164
<i>Oh!</i>

959
01:45:16.032 --> 01:45:21.026
<i>Oh, how will you find your way?</i>

960
01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:29.037
<i>Oh, how will you find your way?</i>

961
01:45:36.419 --> 01:45:40.378
<i>No time for tears today
No time for tears today</i>

962
01:45:44.427 --> 01:45:48.454
<i>No time for tears today
No time for tears today</i>

963
01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:06.205
<i>So many doors, how did you choose?</i>

964
01:46:06.249 --> 01:46:08.149
<i>So much to gain, so much to lose</i>

965
01:46:08.184 --> 01:46:10.015
<i>So many things got in your way</i>

966
01:46:10.053 --> 01:46:12.112
<i>No time today, no time today</i>

967
01:46:12.155 --> 01:46:14.123
<i>Be careful not to lose your head</i>

968
01:46:14.157 --> 01:46:16.421
<i>Remember what the dormouse said</i>

969
01:46:16.459 --> 01:46:17.790
<i>Alice!</i>

970
01:46:28.004 --> 01:46:32.464
<i>Did someone pull you by the hand?</i>

971
01:46:35.879 --> 01:46:40.441
<i>How many miles to Wonderland?</i>

972
01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:48.457
<i>Please tell us so we'll understand</i>

973
01:46:48.491 --> 01:46:53.224
<i>Alice, Alice, oh, Alice</i>

974
01:47:04.007 --> 01:47:08.967
<i>Oh, how will you find your way?</i>

975
01:47:12.015 --> 01:47:17.248
<i>Oh, how will you find your way?</i>
