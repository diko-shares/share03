00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:51.101
Lucille: Tony, don't forget
to tell uncle Louie

2
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.091
that I left the red wine
and the parmesan

3
00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:54.547
in the refrigerator, all right.

4
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:55.756
- Bye-bye.
- Daniel: Okay.

5
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:56.851
Bye, Judy.

6
00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:58.391
Judy: Send me a picture.

7
00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.039
I'll be back soon.
Don't worry about it.

8
00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:02.520
Lucille: Be careful. Be careful, now.

9
00:01:02.608 --> 00:01:04.269
Judy: Bye.

10
00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:05.474
Daniel: Take it easy now.

11
00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:06.934
All: Bye!

12
00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:21.164
All: Bye!

13
00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:36.842
Lucille:
California, here we come

14
00:01:36.934 --> 00:01:38.049
oh, come on, Daniel.

15
00:01:38.143 --> 00:01:39.746
What's the matter?
You don't like my singing?

16
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.039
Daniel: I don't like the song, ma.

17
00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:42.928
You're gonna love California.

18
00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:44.863
You get up in the morning,
you roll out of bed.

19
00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:46.211
Plop. You're in your swimming pool.

20
00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:47.315
Yeah, sure.

21
00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:48.812
All right. You'll see.

22
00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:51.486
You know, this isn't exactly
a dump we're moving to, you know.

23
00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:01.848
Lucille: Push, Daniel. Push!

24
00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:04.347
Give it all you got, kid.
Come on, push it!

25
00:03:04.438 --> 00:03:05.553
Push!

26
00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:07.306
Okay, okay, we got it! Got it!

27
00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:09.973
Come on, come on, come on,
get in, get in. Hurry up!

28
00:03:12.362 --> 00:03:15.069
We did it again. Way to go!

29
00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:42.472
Lucille: Daniel.

30
00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:44.845
Daniel! Come on, wake up.

31
00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:46.892
Look off the starboard bow.

32
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.596
Paradise at last!

33
00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.099
Oh, we made it.

34
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:55.728
Come on. This is it.

35
00:03:56.907 --> 00:03:59.273
This is the end of the line.

36
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.821
You're telling me.

37
00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:04.745
Come on. All hands on deck.

38
00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:10.117
We got to get this thing unloaded
before it sinks.

39
00:04:12.047 --> 00:04:14.538
Look at those palm trees!

40
00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:16.339
Damn! Do you know what that means?

41
00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:18.712
Yeah. Watch out for falling coconuts.

42
00:04:18.804 --> 00:04:21.671
Wise guy. No more Newark winters!

43
00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:22.880
I like winters, ma.

44
00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:24.134
Oh, you like sore throats?

45
00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:26.012
You like frozen toes?

46
00:04:26.103 --> 00:04:27.513
I don't like smog.

47
00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:29.560
Did I tell you about the pool here?

48
00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:31.559
About 100 times, ma.

49
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.732
Okay, so make it 101.

50
00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.026
Open your eyes, my darling son.

51
00:04:36.113 --> 00:04:38.274
This is the garden of Eden.

52
00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:39.400
Come on.

53
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.198
Listen, we're in apartment 20, okay?

54
00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:43.775
One flight up.

55
00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:00.751
Eeeyah!

56
00:05:01.972 --> 00:05:03.678
Oh. Are you okay?

57
00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:05.368
Yeah. No, I'm okay.
No, don't worry about it.

58
00:05:05.392 --> 00:05:06.973
- Have a hand up, man.
- Thanks.

59
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.162
You all right?
I shouldn't have done that.

60
00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:09.831
- Yeah, sure. Don't worry about it.
- That was stupid. You all right?

61
00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:11.457
So you got to be the new people
in apartment 20, right?

62
00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:12.812
Oh, yeah. I guess so.

63
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:14.647
Hey, Freddy Fernandez. Apartment 17.

64
00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:15.895
Daniel larusso.

65
00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:17.255
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, let me help you.

66
00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.279
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

67
00:05:18.363 --> 00:05:19.424
I got it. Don't worry about it.

68
00:05:19.448 --> 00:05:21.175
It's fine. It's heavy. It's heavy, man.
Yeah.

69
00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.439
Hey, where are you from?

70
00:05:22.534 --> 00:05:23.614
New Jersey.

71
00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:24.782
What you doing out here?

72
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.986
My mom got a job with
some company out here.

73
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.116
Rockets, computers,
flight of the future.

74
00:05:29.207 --> 00:05:30.207
I don't know.

75
00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:31.623
Never heard of it.

76
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.416
It's up-and-coming.

77
00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:35.501
Is this the only pool you guys got here?

78
00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:36.704
Yeah, that's it.

79
00:05:36.798 --> 00:05:38.038
Hey, what was that? Karate?

80
00:05:39.217 --> 00:05:40.217
What? Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:41.841
Yeah? Been doing it long?

82
00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:43.043
A while.

83
00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:44.298
Ever use it?

84
00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.595
A couple of times, you know.

85
00:05:45.682 --> 00:05:47.263
Freddy: Bet you can kick some ass, huh?

86
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.840
Yeah, I'd like to learn someday.

87
00:05:48.935 --> 00:05:50.471
Maybe you could teach me sometime.

88
00:05:50.562 --> 00:05:51.706
Okay, sure, that's cool. Anytime.

89
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.765
Oh, great.

90
00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:55.893
This place is a dump.
You should go back to New Jersey.

91
00:05:57.027 --> 00:05:58.392
How'd you know I was from Jersey?

92
00:05:58.487 --> 00:06:01.479
'Cause I'm from New Jersey.
I got a nose for my own.

93
00:06:01.573 --> 00:06:02.573
Well, what part?

94
00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:03.657
Parsippany.

95
00:06:03.742 --> 00:06:04.742
Parsippany?

96
00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:05.826
Never should have left.

97
00:06:05.911 --> 00:06:07.513
Yeah. I got an uncle Louie
from parsippany.

98
00:06:07.537 --> 00:06:08.617
Louie fontini?

99
00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:09.705
No, Louie larusso.

100
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.870
Louie larusso? Yeah.

101
00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:12.288
Don't know him.

102
00:06:12.584 --> 00:06:15.621
Hey, pup. Hey, pup.
How are you doing, boy?

103
00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:16.712
You thirsty, hun?

104
00:06:17.214 --> 00:06:18.374
She's crazy.

105
00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:19.465
What?

106
00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:21.164
She's not playing with a full deck, man.

107
00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:22.259
Aw, she's nice.

108
00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:23.654
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?

109
00:06:23.678 --> 00:06:25.293
What? I don't know. I guess nothing.

110
00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:27.325
Hey, we're having a beach party,
sort of, "adios, summer."

111
00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.384
You wanna come?

112
00:06:28.475 --> 00:06:29.590
Yeah, sure, that's cool.

113
00:06:29.684 --> 00:06:31.496
Hey, great. I'll come get you
in the morning, all right?

114
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.580
All right, all right, that's cool.

115
00:06:32.604 --> 00:06:33.844
Hey, here's apartment 20, man.

116
00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:34.939
Oh, this is it?

117
00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:36.167
Yeah. Should I leave this here?

118
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:37.931
Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for the help.

119
00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:39.786
Hey, no problem.
Nice meeting you, all right?

120
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.855
Appreciate it. You, too.

121
00:06:40.946 --> 00:06:42.298
Take care.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

122
00:06:42.322 --> 00:06:43.607
- Okay, all right.
- Bye, then.

123
00:06:44.783 --> 00:06:46.135
Please don't say anything
about the pool.

124
00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.366
I will call first thing in the morning.

125
00:06:48.954 --> 00:06:50.723
Hey, ma, did you tell that old lady
with the dog downstairs

126
00:06:50.747 --> 00:06:51.827
where we were from?

127
00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:54.372
Yeah. Didn't she remind you
of aunt tessy?

128
00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:56.290
Aunt tessy?
More like uncle Louie, really.

129
00:06:56.378 --> 00:06:58.835
You know, I really think
we're gonna do good here.

130
00:06:58.922 --> 00:07:00.253
I have a very positive feeling.

131
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.625
I'm telling you, Daniel.

132
00:07:01.716 --> 00:07:03.377
I just know it's gonna work.

133
00:07:03.468 --> 00:07:04.674
Oh, the faucet's broken.

134
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:07.441
Oh, the real estate lady said that
there's a fix-it guy around here.

135
00:07:07.514 --> 00:07:09.175
See if you can find him, okay?

136
00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:10.506
Okay.

137
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600
What's that for?

138
00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:13.050
This? Oh, uncle Louie's dog.

139
00:07:13.144 --> 00:07:14.144
Oh, he's cute.

140
00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:15.869
Oh, ma,
I got invited to a party tomorrow.

141
00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:16.939
That's great. You see?

142
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.190
Yeah, I know,
but you wanted me to help you unpack.

143
00:07:19.276 --> 00:07:22.188
I don't remember
saying anything about that.

144
00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.396
Great. I must have you
mixed up with somebody else then.

145
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.855
Thanks, ma.

146
00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:33.241
Hey, can you tell me
where the maintenance guy is?

147
00:07:33.331 --> 00:07:34.912
Hey, pup. Here you go.

148
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.581
Yeah, you go in through there,

149
00:07:36.668 --> 00:07:38.704
turn left, not too far,

150
00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:40.456
then right. Go inside.

151
00:07:40.547 --> 00:07:41.957
You'll find him on the left.

152
00:07:42.048 --> 00:07:43.584
All right. So I go right, then left.

153
00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:47.167
No, no. Left, then right,
then inside on the left.

154
00:08:06.323 --> 00:08:07.483
Hello?

155
00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:16.867
Hey, you the maintenance man?

156
00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.038
Hal.

157
00:08:18.376 --> 00:08:20.662
Yeah, we're the new people
in apartment 20.

158
00:08:22.714 --> 00:08:24.420
Yeah. Our faucet's really leaking there.

159
00:08:31.514 --> 00:08:33.129
Well, can you come fix it?

160
00:08:34.225 --> 00:08:35.305
Hal.

161
00:08:37.228 --> 00:08:39.344
Well, can I tell my mom when?

162
00:08:39.522 --> 00:08:40.728
When, what?

163
00:08:42.817 --> 00:08:44.557
When you're gonna fix the faucet.

164
00:08:44.653 --> 00:08:45.813
After.

165
00:08:46.404 --> 00:08:47.404
After what?

166
00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:49.612
After! After!

167
00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:02.000
Sunshine everyday

168
00:09:02.087 --> 00:09:04.499
think I'm gonna stay

169
00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:06.045
it's always one foot falling down

170
00:09:07.592 --> 00:09:10.129
the good beat, it's my scene

171
00:09:10.595 --> 00:09:13.462
but now's the time fo check it out

172
00:09:13.556 --> 00:09:16.764
to really live the California dream

173
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:19.513
it's almost magic

174
00:09:19.604 --> 00:09:21.595
there's something in the air

175
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.725
on the beach

176
00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:24.807
bop bop Dee Dee

177
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:27.563
something's just begun

178
00:09:27.654 --> 00:09:28.734
you dig me

179
00:09:28.822 --> 00:09:30.813
bop bop Dee Dee

180
00:09:30.907 --> 00:09:33.819
I will find the one

181
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.990

182
00:09:35.078 --> 00:09:36.943

183
00:09:37.038 --> 00:09:38.073

184
00:09:38.164 --> 00:09:40.496
You can always find your dream

185
00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:41.686
can I have the ball, please?

186
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.710
Whoa!

187
00:09:42.794 --> 00:09:44.000
Thank you.

188
00:09:44.087 --> 00:09:45.452
He's pretty good.

189
00:09:45.547 --> 00:09:46.547
Showoff.

190
00:09:46.631 --> 00:09:47.666
Whoa.

191
00:09:47.757 --> 00:09:49.622
Yes. Let's go, come on.

192
00:09:50.552 --> 00:09:51.552
Bye.

193
00:09:51.636 --> 00:09:52.636
Hey, wait up!

194
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.770
Hey, who's that...
Who's that blonde in the blue?

195
00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.845
The hills.

196
00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:01.096
Hills. What's the hills?

197
00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:02.222
It's rich.

198
00:10:02.313 --> 00:10:03.313
Hey, let's go.

199
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:06.682
Bop bop Dee Dee

200
00:10:08.028 --> 00:10:12.692
lost lost in a cloud

201
00:10:12.782 --> 00:10:16.821
nobody knows my name

202
00:10:20.165 --> 00:10:21.225
Freddy: Hey, Danny. Hey, Danny.

203
00:10:21.249 --> 00:10:22.284
What? What?

204
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:24.036
I think the blonde is looking at you.

205
00:10:24.127 --> 00:10:25.242
Oh, yeah, right.

206
00:10:25.336 --> 00:10:27.918
I'm serious. I think
she has the hots for you, man.

207
00:10:28.006 --> 00:10:29.400
Oh, who could blame her? Right, Freddy?

208
00:10:29.424 --> 00:10:31.380
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
make a move?

209
00:10:31.468 --> 00:10:32.468
No, I'm eating, man.

210
00:10:32.552 --> 00:10:34.030
How could you think about eating, man?
Go make a move.

211
00:10:34.054 --> 00:10:35.054
I'm hungry.

212
00:10:35.138 --> 00:10:37.299
Maybe they ain't got no moves
where he comes from.

213
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.676
No, I got moves where I come from.
Yeah, yeah...

214
00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:41.328
We have more moves
back there than here...

215
00:10:41.352 --> 00:10:42.997
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?
- I'll tell you that much.

216
00:10:43.021 --> 00:10:44.021
Yeah.

217
00:10:44.105 --> 00:10:45.220
We'll see. Yeah.

218
00:10:45.774 --> 00:10:48.186
It takes two lo tango

219
00:10:48.276 --> 00:10:49.607
boy: Come on, buddy. Go, get her.

220
00:10:49.694 --> 00:10:51.374
All right, all right.
I'm going. I'm going.

221
00:10:51.404 --> 00:10:52.644
All: Go get her. Go get her.

222
00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:53.774
Come on.

223
00:10:53.865 --> 00:10:55.275
I'm going, okay?

224
00:10:55.366 --> 00:10:56.486
Hey, did you lose something?

225
00:10:56.576 --> 00:10:58.112
Yeah. I hope we're not bothering you.

226
00:10:58.203 --> 00:10:59.989
Hey, how do you, uh, how do you juggle?

227
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.411
Oh, it's pretty easy.

228
00:11:01.498 --> 00:11:03.955
It's... you just...
I start with my knee.

229
00:11:04.042 --> 00:11:06.374
You just go one.
You know, one at a time. One.

230
00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:08.497
And then you try, two. One, two.

231
00:11:08.588 --> 00:11:10.579
- You try it. Three, four.
- Four.

232
00:11:10.673 --> 00:11:12.834
Try it. Just bring your leg up.
One. Good!

233
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.425
All right!

234
00:11:20.517 --> 00:11:21.632
That was awesome!

235
00:11:21.726 --> 00:11:24.593
Brew time, man!
Who's for a warm one? Here you go.

236
00:11:24.687 --> 00:11:26.223
- No, I pass, man.
- Hey, Bobby.

237
00:11:26.314 --> 00:11:27.314
No, thanks, pal.

238
00:11:27.398 --> 00:11:29.293
Johnny, who are you kidding?
You're still the Ace degenerate.

239
00:11:29.317 --> 00:11:31.182
No, ex-degenerate, man.

240
00:11:31.277 --> 00:11:32.983
8:00 A.M. tomorrow, I'm a senior.

241
00:11:33.071 --> 00:11:34.652
I've got one year to make it all work.

242
00:11:34.739 --> 00:11:36.479
And that's what I'm gonna do.
Make it work.

243
00:11:36.574 --> 00:11:37.609
All of it, right?

244
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.700
That's right, man.

245
00:11:38.785 --> 00:11:40.650
Hey, you must be a trendsetter, Johnny.

246
00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:42.576
Looks like everyone's
doing something new.

247
00:11:42.664 --> 00:11:44.120
- What?
- Take a right. Check it out.

248
00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:48.658
Hey, Johnny, forget it, man.
It's ancient history.

249
00:11:48.753 --> 00:11:49.753
Who told you, man?

250
00:11:49.838 --> 00:11:50.838
Johnny!

251
00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:51.982
Hey, man, I thought they broke up.

252
00:11:52.006 --> 00:11:53.006
She did. He didn't.

253
00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:56.423
Here, come on. Try it.

254
00:11:56.511 --> 00:11:58.718
Yeah. Watch this.

255
00:11:58.805 --> 00:12:01.137
Oh. Well, I'll get it.
I'll be right back.

256
00:12:02.183 --> 00:12:03.673
Those were the nights

257
00:12:03.768 --> 00:12:05.759
dancing around the street light

258
00:12:05.854 --> 00:12:07.765
you were in my eye

259
00:12:09.232 --> 00:12:12.850
we were a team racing to a night dream

260
00:12:12.944 --> 00:12:15.606
radio played on

261
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.469
Johnny: Hey, Ali, I want to talk to you.

262
00:12:20.493 --> 00:12:21.949
Ali: You just leave me alone.

263
00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:23.305
We've been over all this, all right?

264
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:24.444
I don't want to talk.

265
00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:26.099
Well, I want to talk to you, all right?

266
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.104
What is your problem?

267
00:12:30.128 --> 00:12:32.356
Look, why don't you take your cobra kais
and get out of here?

268
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.416
Oh, yeah, right.
And that's gonna solve everything.

269
00:12:34.632 --> 00:12:36.042
- Give me my radio.
- No.

270
00:12:36.134 --> 00:12:37.544
I said, give me my radio!

271
00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:39.321
Johnny: You promise you'll talk?
You promise?

272
00:12:39.345 --> 00:12:40.825
Ali: Yes, just give me my radio. Yes.

273
00:12:45.935 --> 00:12:47.220
You just break my radio?

274
00:12:47.312 --> 00:12:48.973
Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:12:49.063 --> 00:12:50.803
Don't touch it, punk.

276
00:12:50.982 --> 00:12:52.722
What are you, deaf?

277
00:12:52.817 --> 00:12:54.353
Oh, man. What's going on?

278
00:12:54.444 --> 00:12:55.559
You want it?

279
00:12:55.653 --> 00:12:56.688
Yeah, just give it...

280
00:12:56.779 --> 00:12:57.894
You got it!

281
00:12:57.989 --> 00:12:59.945
Cobra members: All right!

282
00:13:01.951 --> 00:13:04.158
- Freddy: Come on, Daniel.
- Come on.

283
00:13:05.538 --> 00:13:08.075
Ali: Johnny, stop it, will you?
Please... don't...

284
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.080
All: Yeah!

285
00:13:10.168 --> 00:13:11.704
Stop it! Stop it!

286
00:13:11.794 --> 00:13:13.284
I didn't do anything.

287
00:13:14.297 --> 00:13:15.912
Toro! Huh, toro.

288
00:13:19.677 --> 00:13:21.258
You're a big man now, huh?

289
00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:24.095
Look, you started this.

290
00:13:24.182 --> 00:13:26.093
All wanted to do was talk to you.

291
00:13:26.184 --> 00:13:28.049
Then just leave him alone
and we'll go talk.

292
00:13:28.144 --> 00:13:29.850
Yeah. Where did I hear that before?

293
00:13:31.314 --> 00:13:33.430
How about you, hero? You have enough?

294
00:13:33.524 --> 00:13:34.524
All: Yeah, yeah.

295
00:13:34.609 --> 00:13:35.689
Okay.

296
00:13:35.777 --> 00:13:37.267
Okay, man. Now we're even, huh?

297
00:13:37.362 --> 00:13:40.445
No mercy, man. No mercy.

298
00:13:45.536 --> 00:13:47.618
Cobra member:
Come on, Johnny. Come on now.

299
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.200
Let go of me!

300
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:51.747
Why don't you hit me?

301
00:13:51.834 --> 00:13:53.825
You think you're gonna
make me feel better, huh?

302
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.440
- It's your fault.
- It's not my fault.

303
00:13:55.505 --> 00:13:57.416
- It's your fault.
- Everything is your fault!

304
00:13:57.507 --> 00:13:59.338
Why do you have to always fight, huh?

305
00:13:59.425 --> 00:14:01.837
Bullshit. Get on your bikes, guys.

306
00:14:03.721 --> 00:14:05.052
Far out, man.

307
00:14:10.228 --> 00:14:12.765
Boy 1: You sure pick cool people
to be friends with, Freddy.

308
00:14:12.855 --> 00:14:14.255
Boy 2: Where did you find this guy?

309
00:14:15.233 --> 00:14:17.849
Come on, let's go. He'll be all right.

310
00:14:26.911 --> 00:14:27.946
Are you okay?

311
00:14:28.037 --> 00:14:29.618
Oh, just leave me alone.

312
00:14:29.706 --> 00:14:30.706
Uh, just...

313
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.870
I'll help you.

314
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.619
No, just leave me alone. I'm okay.

315
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.710
Just leave me alone.

316
00:14:34.794 --> 00:14:36.034
Come on, Ali. Let's go.

317
00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:38.495
Come on, it's better
if we leave him alone.

318
00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:39.704
Come on.

319
00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:42.965
Come on.

320
00:14:44.554 --> 00:14:46.510
Come on. Let's go.

321
00:15:03.197 --> 00:15:04.607
Lucille: Daniel.

322
00:15:07.118 --> 00:15:08.118
En!

323
00:15:08.286 --> 00:15:09.321
Daniel: Hi, ma.

324
00:15:09.412 --> 00:15:10.527
How was the party?

325
00:15:10.621 --> 00:15:11.861
It was okay.

326
00:15:11.956 --> 00:15:13.696
It must have been more than okay.

327
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:15.201
I didn't even hear you come home.

328
00:15:15.293 --> 00:15:16.373
Any friend material?

329
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:18.247
Yeah, some. Couple of guys. I got to go.

330
00:15:18.338 --> 00:15:19.373
Sit down and eat first.

331
00:15:19.464 --> 00:15:20.544
No, I'm not hungry.

332
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:21.984
Come on, you need energy to be charming.

333
00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:23.319
I'm fine, I'm telling you. I got energy.

334
00:15:23.343 --> 00:15:24.343
Do me a favor.

335
00:15:24.427 --> 00:15:26.088
- What?
- Take off the glasses.

336
00:15:26.179 --> 00:15:27.179
Why?

337
00:15:27.263 --> 00:15:28.263
Because I asked you to.

338
00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:30.887
Come on, ma. It's California.
It's the look...

339
00:15:30.975 --> 00:15:33.557
Come on, take them off.
I want to see your baby browns.

340
00:15:33.644 --> 00:15:34.964
Ma, come on with the baby browns.

341
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:36.261
Are you on something?

342
00:15:36.356 --> 00:15:38.017
Yeah, ma. Minute maid...

343
00:15:38.107 --> 00:15:39.267
Why are you hiding your eyes?

344
00:15:39.359 --> 00:15:40.502
I'm not hiding my eyes, ma. Come on...

345
00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:43.108
- Then take off the glasses. Now.
- Ma, come on.

346
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:51.159
Oh, my god. How did that happen, huh?

347
00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:52.325
What happened?

348
00:15:52.413 --> 00:15:54.119
I hit a curb with my bike and it hit me.

349
00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:56.769
I wore the glasses 'cause I didn't want
you to worry. It looks worse...

350
00:15:56.793 --> 00:15:58.312
Don't do that. It's gonna make it worse.

351
00:15:58.336 --> 00:15:59.730
- Ma, it doesn't hurt.
- Can you see?

352
00:15:59.754 --> 00:16:01.482
- I can see fine, all right.
- Do you wanna stay home from school?

353
00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:02.506
No, no, I got to go.

354
00:16:20.566 --> 00:16:24.650
Hot summer streets
and the pavements are burning

355
00:16:24.737 --> 00:16:26.648
I sit around

356
00:16:29.492 --> 00:16:34.236
trying to smile but the air
is so heavy and dry

357
00:16:38.918 --> 00:16:41.785
strange voices are saying

358
00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:43.744
chorus: What did they say?

359
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.627
Things I can't understand

360
00:16:46.926 --> 00:16:48.962
it's too close for comfort

361
00:16:49.053 --> 00:16:52.045
this heat has got right out of hand

362
00:16:56.561 --> 00:16:59.268
it's a cruel, cruel summer

363
00:17:02.608 --> 00:17:04.644
Daniel: Hey, guys!
Freddy, how you doing?

364
00:17:04.735 --> 00:17:06.316
Hey, karate kid.

365
00:17:06.404 --> 00:17:07.735
Let's see the moves.

366
00:17:08.948 --> 00:17:10.908
Come on, man. He knows
how to get his butt kicked.

367
00:17:10.992 --> 00:17:12.198
Hey, I already know that move.

368
00:17:12.285 --> 00:17:14.221
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here.

369
00:17:14.245 --> 00:17:15.405
Hey, think fast.

370
00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:18.665
How you doing?

371
00:17:18.749 --> 00:17:19.749
Ooh, your eye.

372
00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:22.450
Oh, don't worry. It looks worse
than it feels, believe me.

373
00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:24.001
Yeah, I hope so.

374
00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:26.875
Listen, I never got
a chance to thank you.

375
00:17:26.966 --> 00:17:28.331
Oh, no. That was nothing.

376
00:17:28.426 --> 00:17:30.667
I'm just sorry about your radio.

377
00:17:30.761 --> 00:17:32.592
Yeah, I'm more sorry about your eye.

378
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.616
I mean, I guess you should've
just given it to him.

379
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.221
Why? It wasn't his, right?

380
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.016
Yeah, it wasn't his.

381
00:17:39.103 --> 00:17:40.983
See that? We think alike already.

382
00:17:41.564 --> 00:17:43.100
You know what else we do alike?

383
00:17:46.277 --> 00:17:48.188
Hey, you've been practicing.

384
00:17:48.446 --> 00:17:49.982
Girl: Cheerleaders, over here.

385
00:17:50.072 --> 00:17:51.357
Oh, I got to go.

386
00:17:51.449 --> 00:17:52.449
I'll see you.

387
00:17:52.533 --> 00:17:53.533
Okay. Bye.

388
00:17:53.618 --> 00:17:56.075
Bye-bye. Hey, you got a name?

389
00:17:56.329 --> 00:17:57.569
Ali, with an "I."

390
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:00.412
Hey, what's your name?

391
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.912
Daniel, with an "I."

392
00:18:04.128 --> 00:18:05.868
I'll see you later.

393
00:18:07.465 --> 00:18:08.705
Definitely.

394
00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:10.755
It's a cruel, cruel summer

395
00:18:10.843 --> 00:18:12.799
now you're gone

396
00:18:25.942 --> 00:18:28.729
Cheerleaders: Fight, win! Touchdown!

397
00:18:28.819 --> 00:18:31.811
Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

398
00:18:31.906 --> 00:18:34.272
Go, fight, win!

399
00:18:43.626 --> 00:18:45.366
Boy 1: Get him hard. Get him...

400
00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:46.746
Daniel: I got him. I got him.

401
00:18:49.757 --> 00:18:50.872
Where are you?

402
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:53.541
Have a nice trip?

403
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.757
Boy 2: Coach, look what he's doing.
Look what he's doing to Bobby!

404
00:18:57.848 --> 00:19:00.327
Hey, nobody hits me! I'm gonna tear
your face off! I'm gonna kill him.

405
00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:01.591
Kill him, Bobby! Kill him.

406
00:19:01.686 --> 00:19:04.428
Get out! There's no place on this team
for that kind of crap.

407
00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:05.602
Well, he hooked me, man!

408
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.430
I said, out of here!

409
00:19:07.525 --> 00:19:09.294
What are you looking at?
Back to it. Let's go.

410
00:19:09.318 --> 00:19:11.104
This school sucks, man!

411
00:19:11.195 --> 00:19:12.275
Coach: I said, out of here.

412
00:19:12.363 --> 00:19:13.569
It sucks!

413
00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:21.448
Cheerleaders: Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

414
00:19:22.707 --> 00:19:24.663
Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

415
00:19:26.877 --> 00:19:29.368
Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

416
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.707
Go, fight, win! Touchdown!

417
00:19:36.012 --> 00:19:39.721
Daniel: Two, three, four,

418
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.889
five, six, seven...

419
00:19:45.813 --> 00:19:46.813
Fix faucet.

420
00:19:46.897 --> 00:19:49.479
Oh, yeah, come on in.
It's the kitchen one.

421
00:19:50.067 --> 00:19:53.935
One, two, three...

422
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.645
Oh, karate.

423
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.150
Four. Yeah.

424
00:19:57.241 --> 00:19:59.152
Five, six...

425
00:19:59.243 --> 00:20:00.483
Very good.

426
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:01.661
Seven...

427
00:20:01.746 --> 00:20:02.746
Learn from book?

428
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:03.830
Eight...

429
00:20:03.914 --> 00:20:06.059
Yeah, and a few months
at the y in Newark where I lived.

430
00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:07.083
Nine...

431
00:20:07.168 --> 00:20:08.168
Oh.

432
00:20:08.252 --> 00:20:12.040
10, 11, 12,

433
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840
13,

434
00:20:14.508 --> 00:20:15.508
14,

435
00:20:16.052 --> 00:20:17.052
15...

436
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.176
What happened to eye?

437
00:20:19.764 --> 00:20:21.504
Oh, I fell off my bike.

438
00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:24.090
18, 19.

439
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.851
Lucky no hurt to hand.

440
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:34.733
One, two...

441
00:20:45.247 --> 00:20:46.282
Hi.

442
00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:48.873
Hey, Ali with an "1." How you doing?

443
00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:50.199
Good.

444
00:20:50.294 --> 00:20:51.454
Not too hungry today.

445
00:20:51.545 --> 00:20:52.545
Hmm, not really.

446
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.042
Here, have some pie. I made it myself.

447
00:20:55.132 --> 00:20:56.132
Yeah?

448
00:20:56.967 --> 00:20:58.582
So, how do you like the valley so far?

449
00:20:58.678 --> 00:21:00.259
Well, it hasn't been dull.

450
00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:01.677
Was Newark dull?

451
00:21:02.765 --> 00:21:04.551
How'd you know I was from Newark?

452
00:21:04.642 --> 00:21:05.722
I asked.

453
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.095
Oh, really?

454
00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:09.385
You sitting with anybody?

455
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.720
With you, if it's okay.

456
00:21:10.815 --> 00:21:12.430
Sounds great to me. You want some milk?

457
00:21:12.525 --> 00:21:13.525
Yeah, thanks.

458
00:21:13.609 --> 00:21:16.100
Listen, I'm sorry
about the soccer tryouts.

459
00:21:16.195 --> 00:21:17.605
Those are the breaks, you know.

460
00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:21.072
No, you remember that guy
I had trouble with on the beach?

461
00:21:21.158 --> 00:21:22.944
Oh, yeah. King karate?

462
00:21:23.035 --> 00:21:24.991
Yeah. That was my ex-boyfriend.

463
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:27.240
Oh, that's good to know. What?

464
00:21:27.331 --> 00:21:29.492
What? Oh, yeah, you're right.
You're right. I know...

465
00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:30.743
What are you doing?

466
00:21:30.835 --> 00:21:32.416
It's just this little voice, you know.

467
00:21:32.503 --> 00:21:34.539
It's telling me
I got to be some kind of a yo-yo

468
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.816
to be talking to you right now.

469
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.455
That'll be $2.50.

470
00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.256
Wait, for both.

471
00:21:39.343 --> 00:21:40.549
$3.75.

472
00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:41.751
$3.75.

473
00:21:41.846 --> 00:21:43.427
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter, anyway.

474
00:21:43.514 --> 00:21:44.799
Why is that?

475
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.096
Because it's over.

476
00:21:46.183 --> 00:21:48.595
It's over? Wait. How over?

477
00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:49.721
Weeks.

478
00:21:49.812 --> 00:21:52.770
Weeks. One week? Five weeks?
How many weeks is "weeks"?

479
00:22:02.158 --> 00:22:05.025
John: Fear does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

480
00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:06.450
Students: No, sensei!

481
00:22:06.537 --> 00:22:09.449
Pain does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

482
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.905
No, sensei!

483
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.083
Defeat does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

484
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.455
No, sensei!

485
00:22:15.546 --> 00:22:18.754
Fear does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

486
00:22:18.841 --> 00:22:20.126
No, sensei!

487
00:22:20.217 --> 00:22:23.505
Pain does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

488
00:22:23.596 --> 00:22:24.961
No, sensei!

489
00:22:25.055 --> 00:22:28.297
Defeat does not exist
in this dojo, does it?

490
00:22:28.392 --> 00:22:30.223
No, sensei!

491
00:22:30.311 --> 00:22:31.551
Prepare!

492
00:22:35.357 --> 00:22:36.972
What do we study here?

493
00:22:37.067 --> 00:22:38.728
Students: The way of defense, sir!

494
00:22:39.195 --> 00:22:41.026
And what is that way?

495
00:22:41.113 --> 00:22:43.775
Strike first, strike hard,
no mercy, sir!

496
00:22:43.866 --> 00:22:45.982
I can't hear you!

497
00:22:46.076 --> 00:22:49.193
Strike first, strike hard,
no mercy, sir!

498
00:22:51.081 --> 00:22:52.116
Mr. Lawrence.

499
00:22:52.208 --> 00:22:53.414
Johnny: Yes, sensei.

500
00:22:54.418 --> 00:22:55.908
John: Warm them up.

501
00:23:11.644 --> 00:23:13.384
Johnny: Fighting positions!

502
00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:15.515
Jab punch. Ready!

503
00:23:24.949 --> 00:23:26.064
Guess what?

504
00:23:26.158 --> 00:23:27.158
What?

505
00:23:27.243 --> 00:23:29.359
I'm gonna be trained as a manager.

506
00:23:29.453 --> 00:23:30.613
Isn't that great?

507
00:23:30.704 --> 00:23:31.739
Yeah.

508
00:23:31.831 --> 00:23:34.197
They got this program.
It's two nights a week.

509
00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:36.247
As soon as a spot opens up, you're in.

510
00:23:36.335 --> 00:23:40.203
And the benefits... I could never
get them working in computers.

511
00:23:40.297 --> 00:23:42.288
They pay for everything.

512
00:23:43.425 --> 00:23:45.040
That's great, ma.

513
00:23:46.804 --> 00:23:48.840
What's the matter, Daniel?

514
00:23:48.931 --> 00:23:50.171
Nothing.

515
00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:54.006
Okay. Remember when you
went to the country for the summer

516
00:23:54.061 --> 00:23:57.553
and you hated it because you had
no friends? What happened?

517
00:23:58.983 --> 00:24:00.439
I got poison Ivy.

518
00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:01.891
You met Kevin and Kenny

519
00:24:01.986 --> 00:24:04.819
who became your best friends
in the whole world.

520
00:24:06.657 --> 00:24:08.648
You got to give it a try.

521
00:24:09.118 --> 00:24:13.157
Hey, I know it's hard,
but we're not quitters, are we?

522
00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.950
I guess not.

523
00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:18.373
What's with the karate place?

524
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.745
No, it sucks.

525
00:24:19.837 --> 00:24:23.000
Good, because we probably
couldn't afford it, anyway.

526
00:24:23.382 --> 00:24:25.122
And the girl situation?

527
00:24:25.217 --> 00:24:26.217
It's okay.

528
00:24:27.052 --> 00:24:28.292
Just okay?

529
00:24:28.721 --> 00:24:31.337
To me, it looks like
the whole world turned blonde.

530
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:34.052
You got your eye on anybody?

531
00:24:35.477 --> 00:24:38.184
Ah. Cute?

532
00:24:38.522 --> 00:24:39.932
No, not cute.

533
00:24:40.774 --> 00:24:43.311
She's... I mean, she's beyond cute.

534
00:24:43.402 --> 00:24:45.063
But she's blonde, though. Right?

535
00:24:45.154 --> 00:24:46.439
Yeah. She's got blonde hair.

536
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.612
Woman: Lucille, let's go.
Here they come.

537
00:24:48.699 --> 00:24:50.781
Is she... is she as pretty as Judy?

538
00:24:50.868 --> 00:24:52.324
Oh, ma, she buries Judy in a second.

539
00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:53.947
She buries Judy?

540
00:24:54.038 --> 00:24:55.244
Oh, god.

541
00:24:55.331 --> 00:24:57.492
Listen, you'll tell me
about it later. I love you.

542
00:24:57.583 --> 00:24:59.448
Careful how you ride home.

543
00:25:01.378 --> 00:25:03.869
Smile. She's got an excellent smile.

544
00:25:04.256 --> 00:25:05.996
She's really smart.

545
00:25:07.885 --> 00:25:12.800
I don't know, I'd say she's beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.

546
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.051
I think she's something else.

547
00:25:16.393 --> 00:25:18.304
She's hot. Definitely hot.

548
00:25:47.424 --> 00:25:50.166
Bobby: Looking for a shortcut
back to Newark, Daniel?

549
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.000
Johnny: No, he wants to learn karate.

550
00:25:52.096 --> 00:25:53.281
Well, here's your first lesson.

551
00:25:53.305 --> 00:25:54.340
How to take a fall.

552
00:25:54.431 --> 00:25:55.511
Hey, what're you doing?

553
00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:57.260
Bobby: Hey, don't think about the pain.

554
00:26:28.674 --> 00:26:30.835
This damn bike. I hate this bike.

555
00:26:30.926 --> 00:26:33.759
I hate this frigging bike!
This stupid bike!

556
00:26:33.846 --> 00:26:35.177
God, I hate it.

557
00:26:35.264 --> 00:26:37.346
- Daniel, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

558
00:26:37.433 --> 00:26:38.843
Why did you throw your bike away?

559
00:26:38.934 --> 00:26:40.174
Because I felt like it, ma.

560
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:41.830
Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you.

561
00:26:41.854 --> 00:26:42.889
Oh, my god!

562
00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.015
Ma...

563
00:26:44.106 --> 00:26:46.563
Oh, my god.
Would you tell me what's goin' on here

564
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.481
and don't tell me
about another bike accident.

565
00:26:48.569 --> 00:26:49.713
What do you want to hear, ma?

566
00:26:49.737 --> 00:26:50.737
I want to hear the truth.

567
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:51.881
No, you don't want to hear the truth.

568
00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:53.550
All you want to hear is
how great it is out here.

569
00:26:53.574 --> 00:26:55.135
Well, maybe it's great for you,
but it sucks for me!

570
00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:56.740
I hate this place! I hate it.

571
00:26:56.827 --> 00:26:57.942
I just want to go home!

572
00:26:58.037 --> 00:26:59.368
Why can't we just go back home?

573
00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:02.575
Listen to me. “What?

574
00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:05.282
I cannot help you
unless you tell me what's wrong.

575
00:27:05.377 --> 00:27:06.833
I got to take karate, that's it!

576
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.955
You took karate.

577
00:27:08.047 --> 00:27:09.149
No, not in that... not in that...

578
00:27:09.173 --> 00:27:10.754
Not at the y. A good school.

579
00:27:10.841 --> 00:27:12.297
Fighting doesn't solve anything.

580
00:27:12.384 --> 00:27:14.375
Well, neither does palm trees, ma.

581
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.960
That's not fair.

582
00:27:16.346 --> 00:27:17.866
Yeah? Like it was fair coming out here

583
00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.576
without asking me
how I felt about it, right.

584
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.386
That was really fair.

585
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.510
You're right.

586
00:27:25.647 --> 00:27:26.932
I should have asked.

587
00:27:27.024 --> 00:27:28.855
Yeah, well,
I just want to go home. That's it.

588
00:27:28.942 --> 00:27:31.274
I don't understand the rules here.
I want to go.

589
00:27:31.361 --> 00:27:34.228
Let's see if we can figure out
the rules together, okay?

590
00:27:34.323 --> 00:27:35.438
What about your bike?

591
00:27:35.532 --> 00:27:37.523
It's safer taking the bus.

592
00:27:37.618 --> 00:27:38.983
Why can't we just go home?

593
00:27:39.078 --> 00:27:41.615
Why can't we just go home
and forget this place?

594
00:28:02.351 --> 00:28:04.808
Yeah. I'll tell you everything he said.

595
00:28:04.895 --> 00:28:05.975
You better.

596
00:28:06.063 --> 00:28:07.394
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye. See you.

597
00:28:13.112 --> 00:28:17.071
I am the river man
taking on a fantasy

598
00:28:17.157 --> 00:28:18.192
hey.

599
00:28:19.118 --> 00:28:20.153
- Hi.
- How you doing?

600
00:28:20.244 --> 00:28:21.825
Ooh, what happened to your forehead?

601
00:28:21.912 --> 00:28:22.992
Oh, it was terrible.

602
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.570
It was this gigantic, runaway zit.

603
00:28:24.665 --> 00:28:25.665
That's gross.

604
00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:28.206
Daniel, this is Susan.

605
00:28:28.293 --> 00:28:29.533
- Hi.
- Charmed.

606
00:28:29.628 --> 00:28:31.118
Now, come on, what really happened?

607
00:28:31.213 --> 00:28:32.794
I got in a bike accident, but I'm okay.

608
00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:33.881
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

609
00:28:33.966 --> 00:28:36.708
What kind of bike do you have, Daniel?
Honda? Suzuki? What?

610
00:28:36.802 --> 00:28:39.839
No, it's a, like,
a miyaji turbo, actually.

611
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.930
Yeah?

612
00:28:41.014 --> 00:28:42.094
Oh, really?

613
00:28:42.182 --> 00:28:44.173
Well, we're going to the arcade.
You want to come?

614
00:28:44.268 --> 00:28:45.804
Yeah, sure. Sounds great to me.

615
00:28:45.894 --> 00:28:49.102
Check out this new game
I want to show you.

616
00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:53.690
I just remembered I got to...

617
00:28:53.777 --> 00:28:55.421
I got to... I forgot something.

618
00:28:55.445 --> 00:28:57.132
So I'll catch up with you guys
in a minute, okay?

619
00:28:57.156 --> 00:28:58.612
Daniel, you don't have to run away.

620
00:28:58.699 --> 00:28:59.884
I'm not running away from anything.

621
00:28:59.908 --> 00:29:01.344
Hey, look, we've got to deal with it.

622
00:29:01.368 --> 00:29:03.429
You deal with things your way,
I'll deal with them mine, okay?

623
00:29:03.453 --> 00:29:04.493
I'll see you. I got to go.

624
00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.580
Daniel...

625
00:29:05.706 --> 00:29:06.991
Get off my case!

626
00:29:44.828 --> 00:29:46.318
Did you fix my bike?

627
00:29:46.747 --> 00:29:47.827
Hal.

628
00:29:48.373 --> 00:29:49.488
Thank you.

629
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:50.750
Welcome.

630
00:29:50.834 --> 00:29:52.699
Yeah. I really appreciate that.

631
00:29:55.047 --> 00:29:56.378
Are those real trees?

632
00:29:57.507 --> 00:29:59.213
You like see, come inside.

633
00:30:00.844 --> 00:30:02.175
Thanks.

634
00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:11.969
How did they get so small?

635
00:30:12.064 --> 00:30:13.270
I trim.

636
00:30:13.941 --> 00:30:16.182
Clip here, tie there.

637
00:30:17.236 --> 00:30:19.272
Where did you learn how? Japan?

638
00:30:19.363 --> 00:30:20.443
Okinawa.

639
00:30:20.697 --> 00:30:22.187
Where's that?

640
00:30:22.699 --> 00:30:24.064
My country.

641
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:30.325
China, here. Japan, here. Okinawa, here.

642
00:30:32.668 --> 00:30:34.454
You go to school for this?

643
00:30:34.544 --> 00:30:35.909
Father teach.

644
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.211
Was he a gardener?

645
00:30:38.548 --> 00:30:39.788
Fisherman.

646
00:30:39.883 --> 00:30:41.089
Fisherman?

647
00:30:42.386 --> 00:30:43.842
These are really beautiful.

648
00:30:45.055 --> 00:30:46.511
Come. You try.

649
00:30:46.598 --> 00:30:48.076
No, I don't know how to do this stuff.

650
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.100
No, no, no. Sit down.

651
00:30:49.184 --> 00:30:52.221
No, no, I may mess it up.
I don't want to mess it up or something.

652
00:30:52.604 --> 00:30:53.935
Close eye.

653
00:30:56.066 --> 00:30:57.226
Trust.

654
00:31:01.071 --> 00:31:02.481
Concentrate.

655
00:31:04.199 --> 00:31:06.690
Think only tree.

656
00:31:08.453 --> 00:31:12.321
Make a perfect picture
down to last pine needle.

657
00:31:13.792 --> 00:31:18.126
Wipe your mind clean
everything but tree.

658
00:31:19.715 --> 00:31:22.548
Nothing exists whole world.

659
00:31:23.176 --> 00:31:25.258
Only tree.

660
00:31:27.472 --> 00:31:28.882
You got it?

661
00:31:30.225 --> 00:31:31.510
Open eye.

662
00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.010
Remember picture?

663
00:31:35.605 --> 00:31:36.605
Yeah.

664
00:31:37.774 --> 00:31:39.139
Make like picture.

665
00:31:48.994 --> 00:31:50.734
Just trust picture.

666
00:31:52.414 --> 00:31:54.826
But how do I know
if my picture's the right one?

667
00:31:54.916 --> 00:31:58.454
If come from inside you,
always right one.

668
00:32:33.538 --> 00:32:34.869
Hi.

669
00:32:34.956 --> 00:32:36.492
Hey, ma. Come on in.

670
00:32:37.959 --> 00:32:39.199
You fixed your bike.

671
00:32:39.294 --> 00:32:41.159
No, no, Mr. miyaji fixed it.

672
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.042
Oh, wow. Great. Thank you.

673
00:32:44.508 --> 00:32:46.214
How much do we owe you?

674
00:32:46.301 --> 00:32:48.883
Oh, no, please. My pleasure.

675
00:32:49.137 --> 00:32:50.627
That's very nice.

676
00:32:53.183 --> 00:32:54.468
Hiya, champ.

677
00:32:54.851 --> 00:32:55.851
Hey.

678
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.100
What are you doing?

679
00:32:58.188 --> 00:33:01.100
I'm trimming my baby tree here.

680
00:33:01.608 --> 00:33:03.189
Bonsai tree.

681
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.975
Banzai tree.

682
00:33:05.195 --> 00:33:06.401
Bonsai.

683
00:33:06.863 --> 00:33:07.863
Bonsai.

684
00:33:08.698 --> 00:33:09.983
They're beautiful.

685
00:33:10.075 --> 00:33:11.781
Yeah, Mr. miyaji learned it in okinawa.

686
00:33:11.868 --> 00:33:13.074
That's where he's from.

687
00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:15.447
Really? It's so delicate.

688
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:22.201
For me?

689
00:33:22.712 --> 00:33:24.452
Oh, no, I couldn't.

690
00:33:24.548 --> 00:33:26.664
Oh, please. Hurt feeling.

691
00:33:28.051 --> 00:33:30.292
That's very nice. Thank you.

692
00:33:30.387 --> 00:33:31.502
You're welcome.

693
00:33:31.596 --> 00:33:33.803
I know just where it'll go.

694
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.300
Come on. It's getting late.

695
00:33:35.392 --> 00:33:37.223
All right, ma.
I'll be up in half an hour.

696
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:39.892
No, we got to go now. School tomorrow.

697
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.436
Thank you for everything.

698
00:33:41.523 --> 00:33:42.808
You're welcome.

699
00:33:43.442 --> 00:33:49.233
Oh. Don't forget the tree.
Must practice.

700
00:33:50.323 --> 00:33:51.323
Thank you.

701
00:33:51.408 --> 00:33:52.693
Sayonara.

702
00:33:52.784 --> 00:33:53.819
Sayonara.

703
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:54.945
Good night.

704
00:33:55.036 --> 00:33:57.072
Hey, thanks again. I'll see you.

705
00:34:00.625 --> 00:34:02.425
Hey, ma, you know,
he gave you the nicest one.

706
00:34:02.461 --> 00:34:03.771
- I know.
- This guy's something else.

707
00:34:03.795 --> 00:34:05.706
Did you see...
You saw what he did to my bike.

708
00:34:05.797 --> 00:34:07.128
This guy's great.

709
00:34:09.551 --> 00:34:10.551
Girl: Hi.

710
00:34:37.287 --> 00:34:40.120
Oh, Daniel-San.
Happy Halloween. You like?

711
00:34:40.207 --> 00:34:41.572
Yeah, that's nice.

712
00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:44.624
How school today? Lot's happening.

713
00:34:46.296 --> 00:34:48.708
What's the matter? You not going?

714
00:34:48.798 --> 00:34:50.129
Daniel: Nah.

715
00:34:50.383 --> 00:34:51.383
How come?

716
00:34:52.177 --> 00:34:54.418
I'm not into dancing that much.

717
00:34:55.722 --> 00:34:57.587
I don't feel like it, anyway.

718
00:34:57.682 --> 00:35:01.971
Oh, Daniel-San, you too
much by self. Not good.

719
00:35:02.812 --> 00:35:06.145
I'm not by myself. I'm with you.

720
00:35:07.484 --> 00:35:11.853
To make honey, young bee
need young flower, not old prune.

721
00:35:13.198 --> 00:35:15.359
I don't have a costume, anyway.

722
00:35:16.159 --> 00:35:18.821
If have costume, you go?

723
00:35:19.871 --> 00:35:22.658
Yeah, maybe if I went
as the invisible man.

724
00:35:22.749 --> 00:35:24.831
"Invisible man"?

725
00:35:25.919 --> 00:35:28.251
Yeah, you know, so no one would see me.

726
00:35:29.256 --> 00:35:30.256
Oh.

727
00:35:32.217 --> 00:35:36.085
Lookin' for you, impatiently

728
00:35:36.846 --> 00:35:40.304
past hasn't been easy for me

729
00:35:40.725 --> 00:35:44.309
I've been so far away

730
00:35:44.813 --> 00:35:46.223
hey, there's Daniel.

731
00:35:46.314 --> 00:35:47.349
Where?

732
00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.440
The shower.

733
00:35:48.525 --> 00:35:49.525
How do you know?

734
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:51.600
I just know. May I?

735
00:35:53.113 --> 00:35:54.978
Don't know what she sees in him.

736
00:35:55.073 --> 00:35:56.904
She must be into fungus.

737
00:36:01.913 --> 00:36:04.370
Ali: Help me! Help me!
My flower needs water!

738
00:36:05.917 --> 00:36:08.579
Hey, you've come to
the right place, stranger.

739
00:36:09.629 --> 00:36:11.620
Yeah, I've never
danced in a shower before.

740
00:36:11.715 --> 00:36:12.817
I had a friend of mine make this for me.

741
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:13.841
It's fun.

742
00:36:13.925 --> 00:36:15.131
Isn't it great?

743
00:36:15.218 --> 00:36:17.129
So, where have you been hiding?

744
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.881
Well, I haven't been hiding.

745
00:36:18.972 --> 00:36:20.587
No, I haven't seen you around.

746
00:36:20.682 --> 00:36:21.967
You been looking?

747
00:36:22.058 --> 00:36:23.093
Sort of.

748
00:36:23.184 --> 00:36:24.184
Sort of?

749
00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:27.056
I thought maybe you
were still angry with me.

750
00:36:27.397 --> 00:36:28.432
Why?

751
00:36:28.523 --> 00:36:30.559
Well, because of what I said
last time I saw you.

752
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.766
Oh, no, no.
I've been thinking a lot about that.

753
00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:35.694
No, I know. But I should really
just learn to mind my own business.

754
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.896
No. I think you're right
about facing things head-on.

755
00:36:37.991 --> 00:36:39.777
I mean, I feel the same way.

756
00:36:40.285 --> 00:36:42.241
I just kind of forgot for a while.

757
00:36:42.454 --> 00:36:43.990
Thanks for reminding me.

758
00:36:44.122 --> 00:36:45.908
You're welcome.

759
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.287
It's just that he thinks
he can do whatever he wants to people.

760
00:36:50.378 --> 00:36:51.378
Who?

761
00:36:51.463 --> 00:36:52.463
Johnny.

762
00:36:52.547 --> 00:36:53.547
Oh.

763
00:36:53.632 --> 00:36:55.484
I'd love to see him get
a dose of his own medicine.

764
00:36:55.508 --> 00:36:57.499
Well, you know,
what goes around comes around.

765
00:36:57.594 --> 00:36:59.676
I'd love to be there when it does.

766
00:36:59.763 --> 00:37:01.299
Yeah. Me, too.

767
00:37:07.145 --> 00:37:09.101
So, you want to go outside?

768
00:37:11.107 --> 00:37:12.187
You talked me into it.

769
00:37:17.989 --> 00:37:20.105
Check out this chicken. He's wild!

770
00:37:20.617 --> 00:37:22.198
Ali: That guy's using real eggs.

771
00:37:22.285 --> 00:37:24.085
- Daniel: This guy is great.
- He hit someone.

772
00:37:24.162 --> 00:37:25.242
No! No!

773
00:37:30.126 --> 00:37:33.414
Johnny. Johnny.

774
00:37:38.343 --> 00:37:39.343
Johnny.

775
00:37:43.515 --> 00:37:44.659
You got the number
rolled yet, man?

776
00:37:44.683 --> 00:37:45.718
In a minute.

777
00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:46.911
All right, I'm gonna go get the guys.

778
00:37:46.935 --> 00:37:48.266
- Okay.
- Hey, hurry up.

779
00:38:45.827 --> 00:38:47.112
Johnny: Shit!

780
00:38:47.203 --> 00:38:48.203
Hey, man.

781
00:38:48.288 --> 00:38:49.994
Daniel: Look out. Watch it. Move, man!

782
00:38:54.586 --> 00:38:56.417
Hey, Johnny, what's up?

783
00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.672
Get out of the way!
Get out of my way! Look out!

784
00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.250
Daniel, what's wrong?

785
00:39:03.344 --> 00:39:04.504
It's coming around.

786
00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.266
Get up!

787
00:39:14.647 --> 00:39:15.853
Get out of my way!

788
00:39:22.197 --> 00:39:23.197
Man 1: What's he...

789
00:39:23.865 --> 00:39:25.821
Man 2: What the hell are you doing?

790
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.400
Get out of the way!

791
00:39:39.881 --> 00:39:41.166
Danger

792
00:39:42.425 --> 00:39:44.757
everywhere I turn

793
00:39:44.844 --> 00:39:49.759
no shelter, and the truth is under fire

794
00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:53.842
there ain't no lookin' back

795
00:39:54.687 --> 00:39:56.723
you put it all behind

796
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.273
when you're runnin' out of time

797
00:40:04.072 --> 00:40:05.437
boy: He ain't going over.

798
00:40:08.117 --> 00:40:09.357
We got him now.

799
00:40:10.662 --> 00:40:12.243
You little wimp.

800
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:18.499
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, little twerp?

801
00:40:18.586 --> 00:40:20.292
No, you had to push it.

802
00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.711
Well, now, you're gonna pay.

803
00:40:23.508 --> 00:40:25.624
Where are you going, sweetheart?

804
00:40:26.803 --> 00:40:28.134
How about a front kick, Johnny?

805
00:40:33.142 --> 00:40:34.142
Get him up.

806
00:40:34.227 --> 00:40:36.058
Bobby: Leave him alone, man.
He's had enough.

807
00:40:36.145 --> 00:40:37.225
Shut up, Bobby!

808
00:40:37.313 --> 00:40:38.913
Look at him.
God, he can't even stand up.

809
00:40:38.982 --> 00:40:40.813
- Johnny: So what?
- That don't mean squat.

810
00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.562
Johnny, leave him alone, man.
He's had enough!

811
00:40:43.653 --> 00:40:45.189
I'll decide when he's had enough, man.

812
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.941
What is wrong with you, Johnny?

813
00:40:47.031 --> 00:40:49.238
- The enemy deserves no mercy. Right?
- Right.

814
00:40:49.325 --> 00:40:50.690
Right. _right.

815
00:40:50.785 --> 00:40:51.785
Bobby: You're crazy, man!

816
00:40:56.875 --> 00:40:58.331
Tommy, Bobby, get him!

817
00:41:28.865 --> 00:41:30.196
Daniel-San.

818
00:41:31.743 --> 00:41:32.778
Come.

819
00:41:45.798 --> 00:41:47.288
Miyagi got you.

820
00:42:15.286 --> 00:42:16.742
Leave on.

821
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.570
It stinks, man. What is this?

822
00:42:18.665 --> 00:42:20.405
Smell bad, heal good.

823
00:42:25.088 --> 00:42:26.669
Hey, where did spiderman go?

824
00:42:26.756 --> 00:42:27.791
Who?

825
00:42:27.882 --> 00:42:31.090
That guy. That guy who bailed me out.
Where did he go?

826
00:42:34.305 --> 00:42:35.761
What, you?

827
00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:38.809
No way.

828
00:42:38.893 --> 00:42:40.008
Why no way?

829
00:42:40.103 --> 00:42:41.138
Because, because...

830
00:42:41.229 --> 00:42:43.390
Because, because old man?

831
00:42:44.732 --> 00:42:47.269
Have tea. Feel better.

832
00:43:13.928 --> 00:43:15.509
How come you didn't tell me?

833
00:43:15.596 --> 00:43:16.756
Tell you what?

834
00:43:16.848 --> 00:43:18.509
That you knew karate.

835
00:43:18.599 --> 00:43:19.759
You never ask.

836
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:21.682
Where'd you learn it from?

837
00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:22.929
Father.

838
00:43:23.312 --> 00:43:25.018
I thought he was a fisherman.

839
00:43:26.482 --> 00:43:31.146
In okinawa, all miyagi know two thing,
fish and karate.

840
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:35.147
Karate come from China, 16th century.

841
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.315
Called "te." "Hand."

842
00:43:38.494 --> 00:43:43.454
Much later,
miyagi ancestor call "karate".

843
00:43:44.167 --> 00:43:45.828
"Empty hand."

844
00:43:47.003 --> 00:43:50.245
I always thought it came from
Buddhist temples and stuff like that.

845
00:43:51.007 --> 00:43:52.918
You have too much TV.

846
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:55.667
That's what my mother tells me.

847
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:02.340
Hey, you ever taught anyone?

848
00:44:02.435 --> 00:44:03.435
No.

849
00:44:03.519 --> 00:44:04.634
Would you?

850
00:44:05.188 --> 00:44:06.188
Depend.

851
00:44:06.272 --> 00:44:07.432
On what?

852
00:44:07.523 --> 00:44:08.729
Reason.

853
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.935
How's revenge?

854
00:44:13.362 --> 00:44:17.856
Daniel-San, you look revenge that way,
start by digging two grave.

855
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:21.276
Well, at least I have company, right?

856
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.533
Fighting always last answer to problem.

857
00:44:25.792 --> 00:44:28.955
No offense, Mr. miyaji, but I don't
think you understand my problem.

858
00:44:29.045 --> 00:44:32.128
Miyagi understand problem perfect.

859
00:44:33.508 --> 00:44:37.000
Your friend all karate student, eh?

860
00:44:40.264 --> 00:44:41.845
Problem, attitude.

861
00:44:42.183 --> 00:44:44.890
No, problem is I'm getting
my ass kicked every other day.

862
00:44:44.977 --> 00:44:45.977
That's the problem.

863
00:44:46.062 --> 00:44:49.600
Because boys have bad attitude.

864
00:44:50.733 --> 00:44:53.065
Karate for defense only.

865
00:44:54.403 --> 00:44:56.815
That's not what these guys
are taught, man.

866
00:44:57.573 --> 00:44:58.904
I can see.

867
00:44:59.617 --> 00:45:01.608
No such thing bad student.

868
00:45:01.702 --> 00:45:03.283
Only bad teacher.

869
00:45:03.746 --> 00:45:06.078
Teacher say, student do.

870
00:45:07.333 --> 00:45:09.244
Oh, great.
That solves everything for me.

871
00:45:09.335 --> 00:45:12.168
I'll just go to the school
and straighten it out with the teacher.

872
00:45:12.255 --> 00:45:13.495
No problem.

873
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:16.752
Now use head for something
other than target.

874
00:45:18.427 --> 00:45:20.509
I was only kidding about that.

875
00:45:20.596 --> 00:45:21.961
Why kidding?

876
00:45:22.056 --> 00:45:24.012
Because I'll get killed
if I show up there.

877
00:45:25.101 --> 00:45:26.432
Get killed anyway.

878
00:45:32.441 --> 00:45:34.181
Would you go with me?

879
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:36.942
No, can't.

880
00:45:37.488 --> 00:45:39.444
Why? You said it was a good idea, right?

881
00:45:39.532 --> 00:45:41.363
For you, good idea.

882
00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:44.362
For me, good idea no get involved.

883
00:45:44.453 --> 00:45:46.489
Oh, but you already are involved.
I mean, you...

884
00:45:46.581 --> 00:45:47.581
Very sorry.

885
00:45:47.665 --> 00:45:48.700
What?

886
00:45:54.547 --> 00:45:56.412
Well, thanks for nothing then, man.

887
00:45:56.799 --> 00:45:57.879
Thanks for nothing.

888
00:45:57.967 --> 00:46:00.299
Like I didn't have
enough problems already.

889
00:46:01.304 --> 00:46:02.948
Now I got to carry
your weight, too. Thanks.

890
00:46:02.972 --> 00:46:05.008
Don't do me any more favors, okay, pal.

891
00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:06.214
Daniel-San?

892
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:07.309
What?

893
00:46:11.147 --> 00:46:13.138
Okay, I go.

894
00:46:15.651 --> 00:46:17.892
Oh, excellent, excellent,
Mr. miyaiji, this is great.

895
00:46:17.987 --> 00:46:19.102
Miyagi.

896
00:46:19.822 --> 00:46:21.733
Miyagi. Miyagi.

897
00:46:21.824 --> 00:46:23.906
Hey, what kind of belt do you have?

898
00:46:23.993 --> 00:46:26.109
Canvas. You like?

899
00:46:26.287 --> 00:46:29.120
J.c. Penney. $3.98.

900
00:46:29.207 --> 00:46:31.163
Oh, I didn't mean a belt
like that. I meant...

901
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:34.333
In okinawa, belt mean
no need rope hold up pants.

902
00:46:36.839 --> 00:46:38.830
That's funny.

903
00:46:38.925 --> 00:46:39.925
Daniel-San.

904
00:46:40.009 --> 00:46:41.089
What?

905
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:45.007
Karate here.

906
00:46:46.682 --> 00:46:48.218
Karate here.

907
00:46:49.185 --> 00:46:51.471
Karate never here.

908
00:46:53.231 --> 00:46:54.687
You understand?

909
00:46:56.525 --> 00:46:57.731
I think so.

910
00:46:59.904 --> 00:47:01.769
Good night, Daniel-San.

911
00:47:02.698 --> 00:47:05.440
Good night, Mr. miyaji. Miyagi. Miyagi.

912
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:07.650
Tomorrow morning?

913
00:47:08.371 --> 00:47:09.531
10:00.

914
00:47:10.331 --> 00:47:11.331
10:00.

915
00:47:13.209 --> 00:47:14.619
Oh, and...

916
00:47:15.711 --> 00:47:19.704
Thanks for helping me out
with my friends out there.

917
00:47:33.229 --> 00:47:34.765
Hey, good morning, Mr. miyagi.

918
00:47:34.855 --> 00:47:36.470
Oh, good morning, Daniel-San.

919
00:47:36.565 --> 00:47:37.680
How you feel this morning?

920
00:47:37.775 --> 00:47:38.855
I'm a little sore, really.

921
00:47:38.943 --> 00:47:39.943
Huh.

922
00:47:40.027 --> 00:47:42.143
You know how drive?

923
00:47:42.238 --> 00:47:44.069
Yeah, yeah, I do, really.

924
00:47:45.408 --> 00:47:47.990
No, no, no, I'm not...
I'm not very good at it, Mr. miyagi.

925
00:47:48.077 --> 00:47:49.487
Me, neither.

926
00:47:49.578 --> 00:47:51.694
Well, I really don't have a license.

927
00:47:51.789 --> 00:47:53.120
Me, neither.

928
00:47:53.874 --> 00:47:55.455
All right. I guess it's okay, then.

929
00:48:04.343 --> 00:48:05.503
1! All: Kill!

930
00:48:34.457 --> 00:48:36.914
You lose concentration in a fight,
and you're dead meat.

931
00:48:37.001 --> 00:48:38.207
Yes, sensei. “What?

932
00:48:38.294 --> 00:48:39.625
Yes, sensei!

933
00:48:41.047 --> 00:48:42.207
Get up.

934
00:48:44.133 --> 00:48:46.499
Give me 60 pushups on your knuckles.

935
00:48:50.931 --> 00:48:52.137
Combat!

936
00:48:52.224 --> 00:48:53.224
Hai!

937
00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.190
Hai!

938
00:49:02.318 --> 00:49:03.979
Brown, robertson.

939
00:49:15.289 --> 00:49:16.449
En garde!

940
00:49:17.208 --> 00:49:18.208
Hai!

941
00:49:22.254 --> 00:49:23.585
Point. Front kick.

942
00:49:23.672 --> 00:49:25.458
What are you looking at? Finish him!

943
00:49:28.177 --> 00:49:29.337
Return.

944
00:49:32.431 --> 00:49:33.637
Prepare.

945
00:49:34.016 --> 00:49:35.016
Hai!

946
00:49:37.353 --> 00:49:40.720
We do not train to be merciful here.
Mercy is for the weak.

947
00:49:41.524 --> 00:49:44.311
Here, on the street, in competition,

948
00:49:44.402 --> 00:49:46.438
a man confronts you, he is the enemy.

949
00:49:46.529 --> 00:49:48.315
An enemy deserves no mercy.

950
00:49:48.406 --> 00:49:50.112
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

951
00:49:53.869 --> 00:49:55.359
Come on, let's forget this.

952
00:49:56.205 --> 00:49:58.241
Wait. Not yet.

953
00:50:00.376 --> 00:50:03.664
Class, we have visitors.
Fall in behind me. Hail

954
00:50:10.761 --> 00:50:13.844
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

955
00:50:13.931 --> 00:50:16.297
Afraid the facts mixed up.

956
00:50:16.892 --> 00:50:18.553
Are you calling Mr. Lawrence a liar?

957
00:50:18.644 --> 00:50:20.600
No call no one nothing.

958
00:50:21.063 --> 00:50:23.099
What are you here for, old man?

959
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:25.306
Come ask leave boy alone.

960
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.897
What's the matter? The boy
can't take care of his own problems?

961
00:50:28.988 --> 00:50:30.899
One-to-one problem, yes.

962
00:50:31.157 --> 00:50:34.649
Five-to-one problem,
too much ask anyone.

963
00:50:34.743 --> 00:50:37.325
Is that what's bothering you? The odds?

964
00:50:37.413 --> 00:50:38.744
Well, we can fix that.

965
00:50:39.582 --> 00:50:41.118
Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence?

966
00:50:41.208 --> 00:50:42.208
Yes, sensei!

967
00:50:42.293 --> 00:50:43.624
No more fighting.

968
00:50:43.711 --> 00:50:45.997
This is a karate dojo,
not a knitting class.

969
00:50:46.088 --> 00:50:50.001
You don't come in my dojo
and drop a challenge and leave, old man.

970
00:50:50.092 --> 00:50:53.380
Now, get your boy on the mat,
or you and I will have a major problem.

971
00:50:53.471 --> 00:50:56.178
Too much advantage, your dojo.

972
00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.056
Name a place.

973
00:50:59.643 --> 00:51:01.008
Tournament.

974
00:51:05.608 --> 00:51:08.850
You got real nerve, old man. Real nerve.

975
00:51:09.778 --> 00:51:12.064
But I think we can accommodate you.

976
00:51:12.573 --> 00:51:14.438
Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?

977
00:51:14.617 --> 00:51:15.982
Yes, sensei.

978
00:51:16.785 --> 00:51:17.991
Fall in.

979
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:25.282
Ask one more small request.

980
00:51:25.794 --> 00:51:27.204
Make it fast.

981
00:51:27.505 --> 00:51:30.247
Ask leave boy alone to train.

982
00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:34.125
You're a pushy little bastard,
ain't you?

983
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.336
But I like that. I like that.

984
00:51:38.933 --> 00:51:42.471
All right. No one touches
the prima Donna until the tournament.

985
00:51:43.395 --> 00:51:44.726
Is that understood?

986
00:51:44.813 --> 00:51:46.349
All: Yes, sensei!

987
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.936
But you don't show,

988
00:51:51.737 --> 00:51:53.477
and it's open season

989
00:51:55.157 --> 00:51:56.488
on him

990
00:51:58.369 --> 00:51:59.609
and you.

991
00:52:26.188 --> 00:52:27.519
I can't believe this.

992
00:52:28.399 --> 00:52:29.605
I cannot believe this.

993
00:52:29.692 --> 00:52:30.692
What?

994
00:52:30.776 --> 00:52:32.516
- What you just got me into in there.
- Huh?

995
00:52:32.611 --> 00:52:34.172
You said you were gonna
make things better for me.

996
00:52:34.196 --> 00:52:35.231
That I did.

997
00:52:35.322 --> 00:52:36.357
How?

998
00:52:36.448 --> 00:52:39.986
How? Just save you two-month beating.

999
00:52:40.744 --> 00:52:41.950
Oh, great. I can't wait.

1000
00:52:42.037 --> 00:52:43.837
Now I really got something
to look forward to.

1001
00:52:48.502 --> 00:52:51.039
Daniel: How much longer
till we get to your house?

1002
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.496
Miyagi: Hmm, other side tracks.

1003
00:52:53.591 --> 00:52:55.791
What, are you...
What, are you in the oil business, too?

1004
00:52:56.885 --> 00:52:59.422
Not everything is as seem.

1005
00:52:59.513 --> 00:53:02.175
This place reminds me of Newark.
What are we gonna do here?

1006
00:53:02.266 --> 00:53:03.927
Start training.

1007
00:53:04.018 --> 00:53:05.633
Much work to be done.

1008
00:53:05.728 --> 00:53:08.265
Tournament here before you know it.

1009
00:53:08.355 --> 00:53:10.095
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

1010
00:53:14.528 --> 00:53:16.208
Daniel: Man, that teacher
was really wacko.

1011
00:53:17.281 --> 00:53:18.675
You really think
I'm gonna beat that guy?

1012
00:53:18.699 --> 00:53:19.734
Ah, no matter.

1013
00:53:20.701 --> 00:53:23.488
Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist.

1014
00:53:23.704 --> 00:53:27.663
Stupid, but fact of life.
Win, lose, no matter.

1015
00:53:27.875 --> 00:53:30.708
You make good fight. Earn respect.

1016
00:53:30.878 --> 00:53:32.493
Then nobody bother.

1017
00:53:32.588 --> 00:53:34.374
Hell, they'll bury me where I fall.

1018
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:37.631
Either way, problem solved.

1019
00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.875
Wait right here.

1020
00:53:48.562 --> 00:53:49.722
This is great.

1021
00:53:55.944 --> 00:53:57.104
Miyagi: Hey!

1022
00:53:57.738 --> 00:54:00.275
Oh, Mr. miyagi, I forgot to give
this back to you last night.

1023
00:54:00.366 --> 00:54:01.651
No, no, no, you keep.

1024
00:54:01.742 --> 00:54:02.902
Oh, thanks a lot.

1025
00:54:02.993 --> 00:54:04.358
So, ready?

1026
00:54:05.037 --> 00:54:06.652
Yeah, I guess so.

1027
00:54:09.833 --> 00:54:11.573
Daniel-San, must talk.

1028
00:54:13.754 --> 00:54:15.540
Walk on road, hmm.

1029
00:54:16.048 --> 00:54:20.257
Walk right side, safe.
Walk left side, safe.

1030
00:54:21.095 --> 00:54:23.336
Walk middle, sooner or later,

1031
00:54:24.765 --> 00:54:26.721
get squished just like grape.

1032
00:54:27.184 --> 00:54:31.393
Here karate, same thing.
Either you karate do, yes,

1033
00:54:31.939 --> 00:54:33.725
or karate do, no.

1034
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.356
You karate do, "guess so."

1035
00:54:37.569 --> 00:54:39.150
Just like grape.

1036
00:54:40.114 --> 00:54:41.479
Understand?

1037
00:54:42.783 --> 00:54:44.319
Yeah, I understand.

1038
00:54:45.536 --> 00:54:46.901
Now ready?

1039
00:54:48.163 --> 00:54:49.494
Yeah, I'm ready.

1040
00:54:49.748 --> 00:54:50.783
Yes.

1041
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:55.701
Must make sacred pact.

1042
00:54:57.172 --> 00:55:01.040
I promise to teach karate. That my part.

1043
00:55:02.177 --> 00:55:03.838
You promise learn.

1044
00:55:04.304 --> 00:55:07.637
I say, you do. No question.

1045
00:55:08.308 --> 00:55:09.798
That your part.

1046
00:55:11.103 --> 00:55:12.183
Deal?

1047
00:55:12.646 --> 00:55:14.136
It's a deal.

1048
00:55:14.231 --> 00:55:15.266
Yes.

1049
00:55:19.278 --> 00:55:23.396
First, wash all the car.
Then wax. Wax...

1050
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:25.606
- Why do I have to wash all the car...
- Uh, uh, uh.

1051
00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:28.067
Remember deal. No question.

1052
00:55:28.287 --> 00:55:29.823
- Yeah, but I...
- Right!

1053
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:35.745
Wax on, right hand.
Wax off, left hand.

1054
00:55:36.336 --> 00:55:39.203
Wax on. Wax off.

1055
00:55:39.673 --> 00:55:42.665
Breathe in through nose, out the mouth.

1056
00:55:44.261 --> 00:55:46.923
Wax on, wax off.

1057
00:55:47.014 --> 00:55:49.676
Don't forget to breathe. Very important.

1058
00:55:50.017 --> 00:55:52.599
Wax on, wax off.

1059
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:55.602
Wax on, wax off.

1060
00:55:55.689 --> 00:55:57.304
Hey, where did these cars come from?

1061
00:55:57.399 --> 00:56:00.641
Wax on... Detroit. Wax off.

1062
00:56:01.445 --> 00:56:04.608
Wax on. Wax off.

1063
00:56:16.835 --> 00:56:18.120
No, no, no.

1064
00:56:18.504 --> 00:56:22.372
Wax on. Right hand, make circle.

1065
00:56:22.758 --> 00:56:25.921
Wax off. Left hand, circle.

1066
00:56:26.011 --> 00:56:28.844
Wax on. Wax off.

1067
00:56:29.014 --> 00:56:32.097
Breathe in. Breathe out.

1068
00:56:32.392 --> 00:56:35.225
Wax on. Wax off.

1069
00:56:35.771 --> 00:56:36.931
Ah.

1070
00:56:37.147 --> 00:56:39.559
Wax on. Wax off.

1071
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:43.108
Wax on. Wax off.

1072
00:57:08.595 --> 00:57:10.881
Hey, Mr. miyagi, I'm finished.

1073
00:57:12.266 --> 00:57:14.257
Hey, you want to check these out?

1074
00:57:15.519 --> 00:57:16.759
Mr. miyagi?

1075
00:57:18.981 --> 00:57:20.141
Mr. miyagi?

1076
00:57:23.443 --> 00:57:25.024
Mr. miyagi?

1077
00:57:27.197 --> 00:57:28.437
Hello?

1078
00:57:29.783 --> 00:57:30.898
Mr...

1079
00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.547
Hey, there you are. I've been
looking all over for you today.

1080
00:58:07.571 --> 00:58:08.571
Where you been?

1081
00:58:08.655 --> 00:58:09.690
I don't believe it.

1082
00:58:09.781 --> 00:58:11.521
What? Hey, where are you going?

1083
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.941
I'm gonna go find that idiot, Daniel.
It's gonna stop.

1084
00:58:14.036 --> 00:58:15.742
No, relax,
everything's been taken care of.

1085
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:16.890
Oh, yeah. Until next time, huh?

1086
00:58:16.914 --> 00:58:18.575
No, there isn't gonna be a next time.

1087
00:58:18.665 --> 00:58:19.665
There they are.

1088
00:58:19.917 --> 00:58:21.828
What? All right. Watch this.

1089
00:58:21.919 --> 00:58:24.160
Hey, you guys.
How you doing? It's good to see you.

1090
00:58:24.254 --> 00:58:27.166
Hey, sorry about the eye there, Johnny.
Your shoulder okay, Tommy?

1091
00:58:27.257 --> 00:58:28.943
You guys be careful
not to go step in front of

1092
00:58:28.967 --> 00:58:30.582
any more buses now, all right?

1093
00:58:31.219 --> 00:58:33.210
Hold it. Remember what sensei said?

1094
00:58:33.305 --> 00:58:34.761
You got to wait for the tournament.

1095
00:58:34.848 --> 00:58:37.214
Must be take-a-worm-for-a-walk week!

1096
00:58:39.686 --> 00:58:41.051
You did all that damage?

1097
00:58:41.146 --> 00:58:44.229
Like, you know, when you make a wish
in a shower it always comes true?

1098
00:58:44.316 --> 00:58:45.647
I should have kept my mouth shut.

1099
00:58:45.734 --> 00:58:47.520
No, no, no. We got an agreement.

1100
00:58:47.611 --> 00:58:49.192
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1101
00:58:49.279 --> 00:58:51.190
Well, they agreed not to beat up on me,

1102
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:53.321
and I promised
not to get my blood on their clothes.

1103
00:58:53.367 --> 00:58:54.402
That was it.

1104
00:58:54.493 --> 00:58:55.949
I don't believe you.

1105
00:58:56.036 --> 00:58:57.492
What am I gonna do, moan and groan?

1106
00:58:57.579 --> 00:58:58.944
Well, anybody else would.

1107
00:58:59.039 --> 00:59:01.075
Yeah, who'd listen anyway?

1108
00:59:01.166 --> 00:59:02.281
Me.

1109
00:59:03.418 --> 00:59:05.079
Oh, really?

1110
00:59:05.796 --> 00:59:08.959
You feel like listening
this Saturday night then?

1111
00:59:09.216 --> 00:59:10.251
Sure.

1112
00:59:10.342 --> 00:59:11.548
All right, great.

1113
00:59:11.635 --> 00:59:13.696
Great. So Saturday night,
we'll go out, we'll have a good time,

1114
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:17.008
we'll do whatever and, uh...

1115
00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:18.589
What is that, your address?

1116
00:59:18.684 --> 00:59:19.684
You got it.

1117
00:59:20.894 --> 00:59:22.294
- Here you go.
- Now, where is this?

1118
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:25.307
- I got to go.
- Okay.

1119
00:59:25.399 --> 00:59:27.139
All right. I'll talk to you later, then.

1120
00:59:27.234 --> 00:59:28.474
All right, great.

1121
00:59:28.902 --> 00:59:30.233
All right!

1122
00:59:33.615 --> 00:59:35.731
Hey, Mr. Harris,
can I talk to you for a second?

1123
00:59:35.826 --> 00:59:37.466
Yeah. Larusso,
third period history class.

1124
00:59:37.494 --> 00:59:38.494
Oh, yes.

1125
00:59:38.578 --> 00:59:39.681
Yeah. I wanted to let you know

1126
00:59:39.705 --> 00:59:41.349
I really got a lot
out of the lecture the other day

1127
00:59:41.373 --> 00:59:43.476
about how the Indian
got the horse. It was really great.

1128
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:44.615
That's nice to hear.

1129
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:47.063
Yeah. I was telling my buddies about it,
but I kind of messed it up.

1130
00:59:47.087 --> 00:59:49.315
So I was wondering if you could give us
a quick review on it now.

1131
00:59:49.339 --> 00:59:50.579
Oh, sure, I'm free this period.

1132
00:59:50.674 --> 00:59:51.914
Well, that's great for me then.

1133
00:59:52.009 --> 00:59:53.965
All: I got to go.

1134
00:59:54.928 --> 00:59:56.208
That leaves you and me, larusso,

1135
00:59:56.263 --> 00:59:58.424
but that's all right.
I'll explain it to you,

1136
00:59:58.515 --> 01:00:00.881
and you can pass
the information on to your friends.

1137
01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:02.216
Now the plains Indians

1138
01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:05.552
were a very primitive tribe
all over north America...

1139
01:00:19.119 --> 01:00:20.780
Come on, Casanova.

1140
01:00:47.105 --> 01:00:48.105
Hi.

1141
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.475
Hi, how're you doing?

1142
01:00:49.566 --> 01:00:50.601
Good.

1143
01:00:50.692 --> 01:00:51.898
You look nice.

1144
01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:53.100
Thank you.

1145
01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:54.935
Hey, you got company here.
I don't know...

1146
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.611
Oh, those are my parents.

1147
01:00:56.698 --> 01:00:58.484
Come on, come on.
I want you to meet them.

1148
01:00:58.575 --> 01:00:59.781
Oh, great.

1149
01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:01.452
Hello, sweetheart.

1150
01:01:01.536 --> 01:01:02.571
Hey, dad.

1151
01:01:02.662 --> 01:01:04.493
Mom and dad, this is Daniel larusso.

1152
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:06.697
And these are my parents,
Mr. and Mrs. mills.

1153
01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:08.032
How do you do, Daniel?

1154
01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:09.126
Hi.

1155
01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:10.211
Hello, Daniel.

1156
01:01:10.295 --> 01:01:11.295
Nice to meet you.

1157
01:01:11.379 --> 01:01:12.585
Where are you going, honey?

1158
01:01:12.672 --> 01:01:14.208
Oh, I don't know. Where are we going?

1159
01:01:14.299 --> 01:01:16.164
I don't know. Wherever you want to go.

1160
01:01:16.259 --> 01:01:17.294
Golf n' stuff?

1161
01:01:17.385 --> 01:01:20.127
All right, I guess we're going
to golf n' stuff then.

1162
01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:22.008
Oh, don't worry about that.

1163
01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:23.534
I thought you were
gonna have that fixed?

1164
01:01:23.558 --> 01:01:25.094
I am. I was. I will.

1165
01:01:25.602 --> 01:01:27.183
You live in encino, Daniel?

1166
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:29.352
What? Encino? No.

1167
01:01:30.107 --> 01:01:31.688
Where do you live?

1168
01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.983
Out in, like, reseda, you know.

1169
01:01:35.987 --> 01:01:37.568
And that's your mother?

1170
01:01:37.656 --> 01:01:39.362
Yeah, yeah, that's her.

1171
01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:40.699
Hi!

1172
01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:43.321
She's waiting for us now.
We better get going.

1173
01:01:43.411 --> 01:01:44.446
It's nice to meet you.

1174
01:01:44.538 --> 01:01:45.573
Not too late, sweetheart.

1175
01:01:45.664 --> 01:01:46.904
Okay, dad.

1176
01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.664
Daniel: I feel like an idiot.

1177
01:01:51.711 --> 01:01:54.043
- Hi, Mrs. larusso. I'm Ali.
- Hi.

1178
01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:56.213
Hi, Ali. Call me Lucille.

1179
01:01:56.299 --> 01:01:57.299
Okay.

1180
01:01:57.384 --> 01:01:59.170
That's a beautiful house you have.

1181
01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:00.421
Oh, thanks.

1182
01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:08.008
Can you drive a stick?

1183
01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.138
Yeah.

1184
01:02:09.229 --> 01:02:11.686
Good. Put it into second. Let it roll.

1185
01:02:11.773 --> 01:02:13.764
When I say "pop it," pop it.

1186
01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:15.144
- Pop it.
- All right.

1187
01:02:20.198 --> 01:02:22.689
Don't worry, it's all under control.

1188
01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:24.574
She's cute.

1189
01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:26.193
Happens all the time.

1190
01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:30.994
Lucille: Okay, larusso!
Push! On, you huskies!

1191
01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:32.824
Okay, pop it!

1192
01:02:34.045 --> 01:02:36.206
Oh-ho! We got it, larusso!

1193
01:02:54.608 --> 01:02:57.190
Lucille: I'll pick you up at 11:00.
Please don't be late.

1194
01:02:57.277 --> 01:02:58.437
- All right, mom.
- Have fun.

1195
01:02:58.528 --> 01:02:59.608
Thanks.

1196
01:03:02.324 --> 01:03:04.155
Hey, look at that slide, huh?

1197
01:03:04.242 --> 01:03:06.198
Yeah. We'll come back
and do that next time.

1198
01:03:06.286 --> 01:03:07.696
Come on.

1199
01:03:07.787 --> 01:03:09.027
Hey, why next time?

1200
01:03:09.122 --> 01:03:10.987
'Cause we need bathing suits.

1201
01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:13.703
Oh, yeah. Bathing suits.

1202
01:03:13.793 --> 01:03:15.499
Do you play hockey?

1203
01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:17.452
Oh, well, you know, not professionally.

1204
01:03:18.757 --> 01:03:22.545
I need a picture to remember this by

1205
01:03:22.636 --> 01:03:26.174
'cause memories can die so fast

1206
01:03:26.264 --> 01:03:30.052
it doesn't have to be a daydream

1207
01:03:30.143 --> 01:03:33.761
we started something that can last

1208
01:03:33.855 --> 01:03:36.141
can you feel the night

1209
01:03:36.233 --> 01:03:38.064
coming out of nowhere

1210
01:03:38.151 --> 01:03:39.482
hold it tight

1211
01:03:39.569 --> 01:03:42.060
and you will all be there

1212
01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:43.941
breathing in the air

1213
01:03:44.032 --> 01:03:47.775
look it's everywhere,
it comes from all around

1214
01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:51.578
I want to share it all with you

1215
01:03:51.665 --> 01:03:54.031
all with you

1216
01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:56.832
taking what is so strong

1217
01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.538
and all along together right

1218
01:04:00.632 --> 01:04:02.463
we'll reach it out

1219
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:06.634
to feel the night

1220
01:04:22.028 --> 01:04:24.485
Man, this is the best time
I've had since I've been here.

1221
01:04:24.572 --> 01:04:26.028
I guess we'll have to do it again.

1222
01:04:26.116 --> 01:04:27.822
Definitely.

1223
01:04:27.909 --> 01:04:28.944
Eddie: Hey, good-looking.

1224
01:04:29.035 --> 01:04:30.115
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

1225
01:04:30.203 --> 01:04:31.739
Good. Wow, this is cool!

1226
01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.310
Yeah, I just got it. You want a ride?

1227
01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:34.738
Uh, maybe some other time. Okay.

1228
01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:35.868
Are you sure?

1229
01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:38.041
Daniel, this is Eddie.
And Eddie, this is Daniel.

1230
01:04:38.128 --> 01:04:39.584
- How you doing, Daniel?
- Okay.

1231
01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:42.083
Boy 1: Hey, Ali
boy 2: How's it going?

1232
01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:46.459
Come here. We're going over
the hill. You wanna come?

1233
01:04:46.553 --> 01:04:49.966
No, I don't think so.
You guys have a good time.

1234
01:04:50.056 --> 01:04:51.421
Come on, we'll make room.

1235
01:04:51.516 --> 01:04:52.576
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1236
01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.931
Your little friend can come, too,

1237
01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:55.350
if it's okay with his mommy.

1238
01:04:55.437 --> 01:04:57.098
Lucille: Hi, kids.

1239
01:04:57.188 --> 01:04:59.349
Boy: Hey, mommy,
can Daniel come for a ride?

1240
01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:01.557
I really like your car, Mrs. larusso.

1241
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.820
You know, you could have gone.

1242
01:05:11.911 --> 01:05:13.526
Well, I didn't want to, okay?

1243
01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:16.237
It's no big deal.

1244
01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:19.450
Look, Daniel, if I really
wanted to go, I would have.

1245
01:05:19.544 --> 01:05:20.750
Makes no difference to me.

1246
01:05:20.837 --> 01:05:22.498
Do what you want to do. I don't care.

1247
01:05:54.996 --> 01:05:56.611
Wow, this is beautiful.

1248
01:06:00.835 --> 01:06:04.123
Hey, Mr. miyagi. This is great, man.

1249
01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:05.875
You got real fish in there.

1250
01:06:08.551 --> 01:06:10.166
This is outrageous.

1251
01:06:11.262 --> 01:06:13.719
And I thought chung Lee's
Chinese restaurant was nice.

1252
01:06:13.807 --> 01:06:15.513
You beat his act.

Mmm-hmm.

Hey, wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?

1290
01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.973

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.066
What spot?

1347
01:14:05.403 --> 01:14:07.815
Hey, hey, how come you didn't tell me
you were going fishing?

1348
01:14:07.905 --> 01:14:09.315
You not here when I go.

1349
01:14:09.407 --> 01:14:11.614
Maybe I would've wanted to go.
You ever think of that?

1354
01:14:18.749 --> 01:14:21.286
So you're supposed to teach
and I'm supposed to learn, remember?

01:14:21.377 --> 01:14:24.337
For four days I've been busting my ass
and haven't learned a goddamn thing!

1356
01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.665
Ah, you learned plenty.

1357
01:14:25.756 --> 01:14:27.901
I learned plenty. I learned
how to sand your decks, maybe,

1358
01:14:27.925 --> 01:14:29.506
how to wax your car, paint your house,

1359
01:14:29.594 --> 01:14:31.300

I learned plenty. Right!

01:14:31.387 --> 01:14:33.298
Ah, not everything is as seem.

Called crane technique.

1409
01:20:18.567 --> 01:20:19.852
Does it work?

01:20:20.194 --> 01:20:22.685
If do right, no can defense.

1411
01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:24.190
Could you teach me?

1412
01:20:24.281 --> 01:20:27.023
Ah, first learn stand, then learn fly.

1413
01:20:27.117 --> 01:20:28.117
Yeah.

1414
01:20:28.202 --> 01:20:30.568
Nature rule, Daniel-San. Not mine.

1415
01:20:30.663 --> 01:20:32.199
Where'd you learn it from?

1416

Kindly do it yourself, Mr. moto.

I'll pick you up by about 7:00?

1434
01:21:37.187 --> 01:21:40.645
Oh, I'm having dinner

1435
01:21:40.733 --> 01:21:43.395
But I'll be done by 9:30.
Meet me out front.

1436
01:21:43.485 --> 01:21:44.725
Is that cool? Yeah.

1437
01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:46.776
Alan: Hey, Johnny. Johnny, over here.

1438
01:21:47.865 --> 01:21:48.865
What's the matter?

1439
01:21:48.949 --> 01:21:50.564
I'm just hearing
that little voice again.

1440
01:21:50.659 --> 01:21:52.274
Yeah? Pretend you're deaf.

1441
01:21:52.369 --> 01:21:54.200
Encino oaks country club, 9:30.

1442
01:21:54.288 --> 01:21:55.368
Uh, Friday? Yeah.

1443
01:21:55.456 --> 01:21:57.117
- Great.
- Way to go, buttertoes.

1444
01:21:57.207 --> 01:21:58.913
- Hi, Ali.

1445
01:21:59.585 --> 01:22:01.075
I got to be nuts.

1446
01:22:15.851 --> 01:22:18.388
Okay. Here. Stop. Throw anchor.

1447
01:22:24.985 --> 01:22:26.771
Ha, good. Stand bow.

1448
01:22:29.615 --> 01:22:31.901
Ah, no, no, not bow. Bow.

1449
01:22:32.785 --> 01:22:33.820

1450
01:22:33.911 --> 01:22:35.617
What, up front? Yeah.

1451
01:22:35.913 --> 01:22:39.872
Make rock. Left, right. Up, down.

1452
01:22:41.210 --> 01:22:44.293
Side, side. Breathe in. Breathe out.

1453
01:22:45.839 --> 01:22:47.295
No scare fish.

1454
01:22:52.429 --> 01:22:54.135
Hey, when am I gonna learn how to punch?

1455
01:22:55.224 --> 01:22:58.842
Better learn balance. Balance is key.

1456
01:22:59.728 --> 01:23:02.185
Balance good, karate good.

1457
01:23:02.272 --> 01:23:03.853
Everything good.

1458
01:23:03.941 --> 01:23:08.605
Balance bad, better pack up,
go home. Understand?

1459
01:23:09.863 --> 01:23:11.444
Yeah, I understand.

1460
01:23:16.036 --> 01:23:18.493
Hey, you ever get into fights
when you were a kid?

1461
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:19.945
Oh, plenty.

1462
01:23:23.043 --> 01:23:25.785
Why? Fighting, fighting. Same, same.

1463
01:23:25.879 --> 01:23:27.790
Yeah, but you knew karate.

1464
01:23:28.132 --> 01:23:30.669
Someone always know more.

1465
01:23:31.677 --> 01:23:34.464
You mean, there were times
when you were scared to fight?

1466
01:23:35.139 --> 01:23:39.257
Ah, always scared. Miyagi hate fighting.

1467
01:23:39.977 --> 01:23:41.888
Yeah, but you like karate.

1468
01:23:41.979 --> 01:23:43.185
So?

1469
01:23:43.939 --> 01:23:45.975
So karate's fighting.
You train to fight.

1470
01:23:47.985 --> 01:23:49.646
That what you think?

1471
01:23:53.532 --> 01:23:54.532
No.

1472
01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.690
Then why train?

1473
01:23:58.954 --> 01:24:00.694
So I won't have to fight.

1474
01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:04.577
Miyagi have hope for you.

1475
01:24:05.294 --> 01:24:06.955
When am I gonna learn how to punch?

1476
01:24:07.045 --> 01:24:08.660
Learn how punch

1477
01:24:08.755 --> 01:24:10.416

1478
01:24:10.507 --> 01:24:11.542
No! No!

1479
01:24:15.762 --> 01:24:18.424
Daniel-San, you all wet behind ear!

1480
01:24:18.515 --> 01:24:20.597
What are you, crazy?

1481
01:24:22.019 --> 01:24:23.475
You're crazy!

1482
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.706
Trouble with Johnny?

1483
01:24:47.085 --> 01:24:48.950
You two lovebirds having problems?

1484
01:24:49.046 --> 01:24:51.662
Dad, we're not lovebirds.
Hey, dad, what time is it?

1485
01:24:51.757 --> 01:24:54.749
Well, it's about 9:40.

1486
01:24:55.886 --> 01:24:57.717
Um, I got to go.

1487
01:24:57.804 --> 01:24:59.385
You have a date?

1488
01:24:59.723 --> 01:25:00.929
Uh...

1489
01:25:02.059 --> 01:25:03.390
With whom?

1490
01:25:03.477 --> 01:25:04.477
Dad, it's a friend.

1491
01:25:04.561 --> 01:25:06.472
Not that boy from reseda.

1492
01:25:06.939 --> 01:25:08.770
Yeah, he's from reseda.

1493
01:25:09.024 --> 01:25:11.231
He's a nice guy. It's no big deal.

1494
01:25:11.318 --> 01:25:15.106
Honey, you've monopolized
the best-looking man here long enough.

1495
01:25:15.697 --> 01:25:16.697
Hi.

1496
01:25:17.157 --> 01:25:18.237
Hi.

1497
01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.275
Listen, I've been thinking.

1498
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:23.701
Maybe we can call a truce.

1499
01:25:23.789 --> 01:25:26.155
Yeah. I'm not at war. Excuse me.

1500
01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.957
Uh, could we please finish the dance?

1501
01:26:32.566 --> 01:26:34.056
Don't you ever do that to me again!

1502
01:27:27.621 --> 01:27:29.407
Hey, I didn't know you were a singer.

1503
01:27:29.498 --> 01:27:30.600
How're you doing, Mr. miyagi?

1504
01:27:30.624 --> 01:27:32.990
Oh, Daniel-San. Daniel-San.

1505
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:35.284
Come inside. Come inside.

1506
01:27:36.296 --> 01:27:38.036
What's that song you were singing there?

1507
01:27:38.131 --> 01:27:39.792
Japanese blues.

1508
01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:55.095
Banzai!

1509
01:27:56.566 --> 01:27:57.851
To baby trees.

1510
01:27:59.361 --> 01:28:02.524
Ah! Bonsai. Banzai!

1511
01:28:03.573 --> 01:28:04.733
Bonsai.

1512
01:28:05.492 --> 01:28:07.403
Banzai!

1513
01:28:08.537 --> 01:28:09.822
Bonsai!

1514
01:28:09.913 --> 01:28:10.913
Ah, close enough.

1515
01:28:11.915 --> 01:28:13.075
Ah.

1516
01:28:24.302 --> 01:28:26.543
What are we celebrating here?

1517
01:28:26.805 --> 01:28:28.136
Anniversary.

1518
01:28:28.724 --> 01:28:30.589
Whose anniversary?

1519
01:28:32.728 --> 01:28:34.218
- Is this your wife?
- Hmm.

1520
01:28:34.312 --> 01:28:36.052
I didn't know you were married.

1521
01:28:36.148 --> 01:28:39.686
Ah. Damn beautiful, don't you think?

1522
01:28:39.776 --> 01:28:41.266
Yeah, she's pretty.

1523
01:28:42.904 --> 01:28:45.270
Oh, first time I saw her

1524
01:28:46.283 --> 01:28:49.650
was cane field, Hawaii.

1525
01:28:50.954 --> 01:28:52.285
Beautiful.

1526
01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:57.453
Damn good cane cutter, too. Hmm.

1527
01:28:59.546 --> 01:29:00.831
Where 1s she now?

1528
01:29:02.883 --> 01:29:04.123
Need drink.

1529
01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:15.926
Daniel-San. Huh.

1530
01:29:17.689 --> 01:29:19.145
Look. Look.

1531
01:29:19.649 --> 01:29:20.889
Hey, hey.

1532
01:29:24.237 --> 01:29:28.321

Hey. Drink. Drink!

1537
01:29:54.434 --> 01:29:56.265
Sergeant miyagi.

1538
01:29:56.478 --> 01:29:57.718
Yes, sir?

1539
01:29:58.355 --> 01:30:02.189
Regret to inform, wife, son,

1541
01:30:07.322 --> 01:30:10.405
Complication, but no doctor come.

1542
01:30:12.869 --> 01:30:15.702
Land of free, home of brave.

1543
01:30:15.872 --> 01:30:17.578
No doctor come.

1544
01:30:19.209 --> 01:30:21.370
No doctor come.

1545
01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:38.763

"arising from childbirth."

1552

"Valor."

1553
01:34:11.107 --> 01:34:12.438
Daniel-San,

01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.111

Here. Now punch hard.

1558
01:34:31.377 --> 01:34:34.540
What's the matter?
You're some kind of girl or something?

1559
01:34:34.631 --> 01:34:36.496
Punch! Drive a punch!

1560
01:34:36.591 --> 01:34:38.877
Not just arm. Whole body.

1561
01:34:38.968 --> 01:34:40.424
Hip, leg. Drive a punch.

1562
01:34:43.515 --> 01:34:44.755
Give you power.

1563
01:34:44.849 --> 01:34:46.430
Now try punch.

1564
01:34:47.977 --> 01:34:49.217
Once more.

1565
01:34:51.064 --> 01:34:52.179
Once more.

1566
01:34:54.943 --> 01:34:56.308
Very good, Daniel-San.

1567
01:34:58.696 --> 01:35:00.436
Hey, pretty good, huh?

1568
01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:02.480
Look at this, Mr. miyagi.

1569
01:35:05.495 --> 01:35:07.110
Wait! Wait!

1570
01:35:10.792 --> 01:35:12.657
Hey, what do you think, Mr. miyagi, huh?

1571
01:35:15.004 --> 01:35:16.585
I tell you what miyagi think.

1572
01:35:16.673 --> 01:35:18.209
I think you dance around too much.

1573
01:35:18.299 --> 01:35:19.914
I think you talk too much.

1574
01:35:20.009 --> 01:35:21.920
I think you not concentrate enough.

1575
01:35:22.011 --> 01:35:23.091
Lots of work to be done.

1576
01:35:23.179 --> 01:35:24.760
Tournament just around the corner.

1577
01:35:24.848 --> 01:35:26.384
Come, stand up.

1578
01:35:26.975 --> 01:35:30.809
Now, ready. Concentrate. Focus power.

1579
01:35:36.693 --> 01:35:37.693
Drive a punch.

1580
01:35:38.862 --> 01:35:40.773
Drive a punch, Daniel-San.

1581
01:35:43.408 --> 01:35:47.071
Miyagi: Happy birthday to you

1582
01:35:48.329 --> 01:35:52.618
happy birthday to you

1583
01:35:53.376 --> 01:35:57.915
happy birthday, dear Daniel-San

1584
01:35:59.048 --> 01:36:03.132

1585
01:36:05.221 --> 01:36:06.711
uh, make wish.

1586
01:36:07.432 --> 01:36:10.720
Oh, well, I know what I'm wishing for.

1587
01:36:13.897 --> 01:36:16.354
Ah, very good! Very good!

1588
01:36:17.108 --> 01:36:18.723
Daniel-San, ha.

1589
01:36:19.986 --> 01:36:21.146
Ah.

1590
01:36:22.238 --> 01:36:24.354
Number one birthday present.

1591
01:36:24.574 --> 01:36:26.610
Oh, Mr. miyagi, what did you do?

1592
01:36:26.701 --> 01:36:28.566
You didn't have to do this.

1593
01:36:28.661 --> 01:36:30.993
What is this? I have no idea.

1594
01:36:33.791 --> 01:36:35.952
Oh, Mr. miyagi, this is great.

1595
01:36:36.544 --> 01:36:38.034
This is great.

1596
01:36:39.923 --> 01:36:42.130
Hey, where'd this come from, anyway?

1597
01:36:42.342 --> 01:36:46.756
Mrs. miyagi make long time ago.

1598
01:36:49.766 --> 01:36:52.724
You know, if you ever want this,
um, this patch back,

1599
01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:54.266
I'll understand.

1600
01:36:55.104 --> 01:36:56.594
I know you understand.

1601
01:36:58.274 --> 01:36:59.480
Eh, try on.

1602
01:37:00.443 --> 01:37:04.106
All right. This is beautiful.
This is great.

1603
01:37:04.447 --> 01:37:07.439
So, you think I stand
a chance at the tournament?

1604
01:37:07.533 --> 01:37:09.524
Not matter what miyagi think.

1605
01:37:09.619 --> 01:37:10.825
Miyagi not fighting.

1606
01:37:12.330 --> 01:37:14.821
I just don't know
if I know enough karate.

1607
01:37:15.333 --> 01:37:16.789
Feeling correct.

1608
01:37:17.877 --> 01:37:20.710
Oh, you sure know
how to make a guy feel confident.

1609
01:37:20.797 --> 01:37:25.131
Daniel-San, you trust quality
what you know,

1610
01:37:25.301 --> 01:37:26.757
not quantity.

1611
01:37:28.554 --> 01:37:31.261
Hey, today you get driver license?

1612
01:37:31.599 --> 01:37:34.966
Oh, yeah, yeah! Look.
Look at this. Look at this.

1613
01:37:35.144 --> 01:37:37.726
Ah, check that out. Check that out.

1614
01:37:38.356 --> 01:37:40.221
"Daniel larusso."

1615
01:37:42.277 --> 01:37:43.312
Congratulations.

1616
01:37:43.403 --> 01:37:45.644
Yeah, thanks. Kid's legal now, huh?

1617
01:37:46.322 --> 01:37:49.735
Hmm, I never know you have sweetheart.

1618
01:37:49.826 --> 01:37:51.157
Ah, no, no, I don't.

1619
01:37:51.244 --> 01:37:55.078
Look good together. Different, but same.

1620
01:37:56.165 --> 01:37:57.951
No, no, different, but different.

1621
01:37:58.042 --> 01:37:59.042
Hmm.

1622
01:37:59.669 --> 01:38:01.830
Ah, too bad mother not here.

1623
01:38:02.338 --> 01:38:05.080
Oh, shoot! Shoot! Damn.

1624
01:38:05.174 --> 01:38:06.174
What's the matter?

1625
01:38:06.259 --> 01:38:08.654
Mr. miyagi, I've got to go.
I was supposed to meet my mother.

1626
01:38:08.678 --> 01:38:10.438
She was going to make
a surprise cake for me.

1627
01:38:10.513 --> 01:38:11.628
Miyagi understand.

1628
01:38:11.723 --> 01:38:13.679
I wasn't supposed to
know about it. Damn it.

1629
01:38:13.766 --> 01:38:14.766
That's okay.

1630
01:38:14.851 --> 01:38:15.886
I'm sorry.

1631
01:38:15.977 --> 01:38:17.808
Miyagi once have mother, too.

1632
01:38:19.272 --> 01:38:21.228
Go outside. Something to show you.

1633
01:38:21.316 --> 01:38:23.272
- What?
- Number two present.

1634
01:38:23.359 --> 01:38:24.439
Daniel: Number two present?

1635
01:38:24.527 --> 01:38:26.672
Oh, no, Mr. miyagi, you don't
have to give me anything.

1636
01:38:26.696 --> 01:38:28.812
You've given me enough already.
I'm serious.

1637
01:38:28.906 --> 01:38:30.191
No, no, no, no.

1638
01:38:30.283 --> 01:38:31.864
No, really, I'm serious.

1639
01:38:33.077 --> 01:38:34.283
Choose.

1640
01:38:37.957 --> 01:38:40.619
Oh, no. No. No.

1641
01:38:41.127 --> 01:38:42.867
Hurt old man feeling.

1642
01:38:44.964 --> 01:38:45.964
Choose.

1643
01:38:46.049 --> 01:38:47.289
Oh, wow.

1644
01:38:51.054 --> 01:38:52.760
Oh, Mr. miyagi...

1645
01:38:57.852 --> 01:38:59.683
I can't believe it!

1646
01:39:00.313 --> 01:39:01.313
Oh.

1647
01:39:02.065 --> 01:39:05.228
Oh, wow, what a gift.

1648
01:39:15.536 --> 01:39:16.742
Oh, boy.

1649
01:39:20.917 --> 01:39:24.626
Just remember, license never replace

1650
01:39:24.921 --> 01:39:28.709
eye, ear, and brain.

1651
01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.586
Eh, what's the matter?

1652
01:39:35.890 --> 01:39:37.175
I'm just scared.

1653
01:39:37.266 --> 01:39:39.757
You know, the tournament and everything.

1654
01:39:41.687 --> 01:39:44.929
You remember lesson about balance?

1655
01:39:46.609 --> 01:39:47.609
Yeah.

1656
01:39:48.611 --> 01:39:52.103
Lesson not just karate only.

1657
01:39:53.783 --> 01:39:56.365
Lesson for whole life.

1658
01:39:58.246 --> 01:40:01.238
Whole life have a balance,

1659
01:40:03.584 --> 01:40:05.700
everything be better.

1660
01:40:08.798 --> 01:40:10.379
Understand?

1661
01:40:12.051 --> 01:40:13.791
Yeah, I understand.

1662
01:40:17.682 --> 01:40:19.172
Oh, wow!

1663
01:40:25.648 --> 01:40:27.809
You're the best friend I ever had.

1664
01:40:29.902 --> 01:40:31.108
You

1665
01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.145
pretty okay, too.

1666
01:40:37.785 --> 01:40:41.824
Hey, go. Go. Go. Go find the balance.

1667
01:40:43.541 --> 01:40:45.122
Okay.

1668
01:40:46.169 --> 01:40:47.284
All right.

1669
01:40:51.924 --> 01:40:53.255
Banzai, Daniel-San!

1670
01:40:53.342 --> 01:40:54.627
Hey, bonsai.

1671
01:40:55.303 --> 01:40:56.418
Banzai!

1672
01:40:56.512 --> 01:40:57.752
Bonsai!

1673
01:40:58.681 --> 01:41:00.842
- Banzai!
- Bonsail

1674
01:41:11.152 --> 01:41:13.814
Try to make it last

1675
01:41:15.573 --> 01:41:18.280
nothing you can do

1676
01:41:20.077 --> 01:41:22.819
in a photograph

1677
01:41:22.914 --> 01:41:26.327
the innocence you thought
you'd lost is staring back at you

1678
01:41:29.003 --> 01:41:31.836
young hearts beat fast

1679
01:41:31.923 --> 01:41:33.459
driving down the road

1680
01:41:33.549 --> 01:41:35.961
rubber, plastic, metal, glass

1681
01:41:36.052 --> 01:41:37.758
why did you have to go?

1682
01:41:37.845 --> 01:41:39.381
Young hearts die young

1683
01:41:40.598 --> 01:41:43.180
hey, you both, don't shoot! No! No! No!

1684
01:41:45.019 --> 01:41:46.497
Hey, don't leave me here. I'm wounded.

1685
01:41:46.521 --> 01:41:47.681
Good, maybe you'll die.

1686
01:41:50.233 --> 01:41:51.233
Hey!

1687
01:41:52.235 --> 01:41:53.975
I just wanted to apologize.

1688
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:55.651
Fine. You apologized.

1689
01:41:56.239 --> 01:41:57.729
You know, I got my license.

1690
01:41:57.823 --> 01:41:59.154
Yeah? Whoop-de-do.

1691
01:41:59.242 --> 01:42:00.778
Hey, what's with you?

1692
01:42:00.868 --> 01:42:03.405
You expect me to do
cartwheels or something?

1693
01:42:04.038 --> 01:42:06.279
No, I just expect a little bit
of courtesy, maybe.

1694
01:42:06.374 --> 01:42:09.832
But I guess that's just for people with
fancy cars and things like that, right?

1695
01:42:09.919 --> 01:42:10.919
Right?

1696
01:42:11.921 --> 01:42:13.786
Hey, can't you take a hint?

1697
01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:20.801
What's the matter? Truth hurt?

1698
01:42:20.888 --> 01:42:22.491
So, you really think that's if,
don't you?

1699
01:42:22.515 --> 01:42:24.493
- Yeah, I know that's it.
- Yeah, well, you're wrong.

1700
01:42:24.517 --> 01:42:25.677
Oh, I bet I'm wrong.

1701
01:42:25.768 --> 01:42:27.120
You know, Daniel,
I didn't go out with you

1702
01:42:27.144 --> 01:42:29.806
because of a car or where you live.

1703
01:42:29.897 --> 01:42:33.014
Okay, well, while you're on the subject,
why did you then?

1704
01:42:33.734 --> 01:42:35.099
Huh? Why did you?

1705
01:42:35.194 --> 01:42:38.482
Because I thought that maybe
you and me were different.

1706
01:42:38.573 --> 01:42:40.676
Yeah, we're different.
I'm from reseda, you're from the hills.

1707
01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:42.594
- That's how we're different.
- That's not what I mean.

1708
01:42:42.618 --> 01:42:45.781
Why don't you just admit that you can't
handle the situation the way it is then?

1709
01:42:45.871 --> 01:42:47.486
You know, I can handle it fine.

1710
01:42:47.582 --> 01:42:48.662
You can't.

1711
01:42:49.292 --> 01:42:50.577
What makes you so sensitive?

1712
01:42:50.668 --> 01:42:51.668
What?

1713
01:42:51.752 --> 01:42:53.355
She's never been anything
but nice to you.

1714
01:42:53.379 --> 01:42:55.774
Yeah, she was so nice she used me to
make what's his name jealous.

1715
01:42:55.798 --> 01:42:57.318
She doesn't even like what's his name.

1716
01:42:57.466 --> 01:42:58.944
I never could have guessed
the way their faces

1717
01:42:58.968 --> 01:43:00.404
were stuck together
at that country club.

1718
01:43:00.428 --> 01:43:02.043
Oh, that's right.

1719
01:43:02.138 --> 01:43:05.346
You didn't stick around
for the exciting conclusion.

1720
01:43:05.433 --> 01:43:06.952
Oh, what was that? His hand on her ass?

1721
01:43:06.976 --> 01:43:10.093
Her right hook. You think
she sprained her wrist doing her nails?

1722
01:43:12.607 --> 01:43:13.813
She hit him?

1723
01:43:13.899 --> 01:43:15.309
That's an understatement.

1724
01:43:17.862 --> 01:43:19.602
Why didn't she say something?

1725
01:43:19.697 --> 01:43:22.279
She shouldn't have to, should she?

1726
01:43:25.161 --> 01:43:27.743
Young hearts beat fast

1727
01:43:27.913 --> 01:43:29.574
driving down the road

1728
01:43:29.665 --> 01:43:32.247
rubber, plastic, metal, glass

1729
01:43:32.335 --> 01:43:34.075
why did you have to go?

1730
01:43:34.170 --> 01:43:36.832
Young hearts die young

1731
01:43:36.922 --> 01:43:40.540
when they are all alone
and there is no turning back now

1732
01:43:41.552 --> 01:43:42.917
hey, slugger.

1733
01:43:48.517 --> 01:43:50.053
Look, I'm a jerk.

1734
01:43:53.856 --> 01:43:55.221
You are a jerk.

1735
01:43:56.525 --> 01:43:58.186
So, am I forgiven?

1736
01:43:59.195 --> 01:44:01.277
Huh? Hey, I don't hear anything.

1737
01:44:02.573 --> 01:44:04.529
Hmm, sounds like a yes to me.

1738
01:44:04.909 --> 01:44:07.275
Come here. Come here.

1739
01:44:18.381 --> 01:44:21.248
So, I guess you know
about the tournament tomorrow.

1740
01:44:21.342 --> 01:44:22.707
Who doesn't?

1741
01:44:22.885 --> 01:44:24.421
Dumb move, huh?

1742
01:44:24.887 --> 01:44:26.502
Not necessarily.

1743
01:44:27.348 --> 01:44:29.339
I don't have much of a cheering section.

1744
01:44:30.142 --> 01:44:31.382
You got me.

1745
01:44:32.478 --> 01:44:35.720
Well, I'll probably get killed
in the first match, anyway.

1746
01:44:36.857 --> 01:44:38.347
So we'll leave early.

1747
01:44:53.624 --> 01:44:55.227
Hey, I got something to show you.
“What?

1748
01:44:55.251 --> 01:44:56.286
Come here. “What?

1749
01:44:56.377 --> 01:44:57.742
Come here. “What?

1750
01:45:00.798 --> 01:45:01.798
So, how do you like it?

1751
01:45:01.882 --> 01:45:02.882
- This is yours?
- Yep.

1752
01:45:02.967 --> 01:45:05.174
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

1753
01:45:05.261 --> 01:45:06.261
Ah, it's beautiful!

1754
01:45:06.345 --> 01:45:08.006
Yeah, it sure is, huh?

1755
01:45:08.097 --> 01:45:09.337
Oh, my god!

1756
01:45:09.432 --> 01:45:10.467
All right, here you go.

1757
01:45:10.558 --> 01:45:12.014
You want me to drive?

1758
01:45:12.101 --> 01:45:13.341
Hey, it's the '80s.

1759
01:45:13.436 --> 01:45:14.642
All right.

1760
01:45:14.729 --> 01:45:16.456
All right, now to start,
you push that button.

1761
01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.640
Now put the key in there...

1762
01:45:17.732 --> 01:45:18.732
You're incredible.

1763
01:45:18.816 --> 01:45:20.210
Yeah, all right, now press the clutch.

1764
01:45:20.234 --> 01:45:21.474
Get the lights. Get the lights.

1765
01:45:21.527 --> 01:45:22.838
No, no, the other one.

1766
01:45:22.862 --> 01:45:25.524
Okay, good,
now to you and down is first.

1767
01:45:25.614 --> 01:45:26.899
Now you just let it out slow.

1768
01:45:26.991 --> 01:45:28.606
You'll be fine. All right.

1769
01:45:28.701 --> 01:45:30.111
Ali: Hold on!

1770
01:45:30.828 --> 01:45:33.535
This is awesome. This is really awesome.

1771
01:45:33.622 --> 01:45:34.782
How fast does it go?

1772
01:45:34.874 --> 01:45:36.034
Let's not find out.

1773
01:45:38.127 --> 01:45:39.458
Let's see... miyaji...

1774
01:45:39.545 --> 01:45:40.705
What belt are you?

1775
01:45:40.796 --> 01:45:42.707
- Belt?
- Why matter?

1776
01:45:42.798 --> 01:45:45.084
It's open division.
It's only for brown belt or above.

1777
01:45:45.176 --> 01:45:47.167
Oh, yeah. Boy black belt.

1778
01:45:47.803 --> 01:45:50.044
Okay. You better hustle.
They're starting.

1779
01:45:50.139 --> 01:45:52.255
Down the hall, to your left.

1780
01:45:52.725 --> 01:45:53.725
I'll see you inside.

1781
01:45:53.809 --> 01:45:54.889
Okay.

1782
01:45:55.728 --> 01:45:58.060
Uh, excuse me, Mr. referee.

1783
01:45:58.147 --> 01:46:01.230
This is not miyaji. Miyagi.

1784
01:46:01.317 --> 01:46:02.352
Miyagi?

1785
01:46:02.818 --> 01:46:04.558
Miyagi. Okay, thanks.

1786
01:46:04.653 --> 01:46:05.653
Thank you very much.

1787
01:46:13.662 --> 01:46:14.662
Well, well, well.

1788
01:46:14.747 --> 01:46:16.112
Look who we have here, fellows.

1789
01:46:16.207 --> 01:46:19.870
Our little friend, Danielle.
Hello, Danielle.

1790
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:23.123
What's the matter?
Mommy not here to dress you?

1791
01:46:24.423 --> 01:46:26.004
Hey, I'm talking to you, punk.

1792
01:46:26.091 --> 01:46:27.831
Come on, come on, make a move!

1793
01:46:27.927 --> 01:46:30.714
Man: Hey, save it for the ring. Come on.

1794
01:46:31.764 --> 01:46:33.345
Boy: All right. Man: Let's go.

1795
01:46:34.391 --> 01:46:35.551
Come on.

1796
01:46:35.643 --> 01:46:37.474
You know, points or no points,

1797
01:46:39.021 --> 01:46:40.352
you're dead meat.

1798
01:46:41.148 --> 01:46:43.104
Man: I said, out!

1799
01:46:45.569 --> 01:46:46.900
Dead meat.

1800
01:46:50.866 --> 01:46:52.466
Bobby: Let it go.
I think he's gonna cry.

1801
01:47:03.587 --> 01:47:06.750
Male announcer: The winner of
the first match in the open division

1802
01:47:06.841 --> 01:47:08.923
is Lucas snyder.

1803
01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:10.466
Daniel: Hey, Mr. miyagi.

1804
01:47:10.553 --> 01:47:12.043
Hey, Daniel-San, hurry up. Come.

1805
01:47:12.137 --> 01:47:13.297
The tournament is starting.

1806
01:47:13.389 --> 01:47:14.549
Where did we get this?

1807
01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.005
Uh, Buddha provide.

1808
01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:18.537
Male announcer: Daniel larusso,
please report to ring three immediately.

1809
01:47:18.561 --> 01:47:19.596
Hey, where's ring three?

1810
01:47:19.687 --> 01:47:20.687
Over there.

1811
01:47:20.771 --> 01:47:23.458
Hold it! Hold it! Only teachers and
students on the competition floor.

1812
01:47:23.482 --> 01:47:24.597
I'm sorry.

1813
01:47:24.692 --> 01:47:26.273
Oh, well, he doesn't speak english,

1814
01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.360
and I can't understand
his instruction without her.

1815
01:47:28.445 --> 01:47:30.060
She's his, uh, translator.

1816
01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:32.855
What'd he say?

1817
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:35.566
Oh, he says you remind him
of an uncle he has back in Tokyo.

1818
01:47:35.661 --> 01:47:37.822
I guess it's okay.

1819
01:47:37.913 --> 01:47:39.494
“What?

1820
01:47:39.582 --> 01:47:41.163
Oh, oh, he says you're very kind.

1821
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:42.831
Ah, thank you.

1822
01:47:42.918 --> 01:47:44.078
Welcome.

1823
01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:48.170
All right, what are the rules here?

1824
01:47:48.257 --> 01:47:49.463
Don't know.

1825
01:47:49.758 --> 01:47:51.794
First time you, first time me.

1826
01:47:51.886 --> 01:47:53.922
Well, I figured you knew
about this stuff.

1827
01:47:54.013 --> 01:47:55.628
I figured you went to these before.

1828
01:47:55.723 --> 01:47:57.304
Oh, great. I'm dead. I am dead.

1829
01:47:57.391 --> 01:47:58.535
You told me you fought a lot.

1830
01:47:58.559 --> 01:48:01.175
Ah, for life, not for points.

1831
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:03.386
Daniel, look, everything
above your waist is a point.

1832
01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:05.083
You can hit the head,
you can hit the sternum,

1833
01:48:05.107 --> 01:48:07.143
kidneys, and the ribs, got it?

1834
01:48:07.234 --> 01:48:08.349
I hope so.

1835
01:48:08.444 --> 01:48:09.479
Come on, you can do it.

1836
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:11.686
Hey, when are you jerks gonna grow up?

1837
01:48:18.621 --> 01:48:20.361
Daniel: Where am I?
Over here at this one?

1838
01:48:20.456 --> 01:48:21.696
Miyagi: Number three.

1839
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:23.268
What's that guy kneeling like that for?

1840
01:48:23.292 --> 01:48:24.292
Don't know.

1841
01:48:24.376 --> 01:48:26.207
Don't you know anything you can tell me?

1842
01:48:26.295 --> 01:48:27.295
Go, get the hit.

1843
01:48:35.304 --> 01:48:37.169
Bow. Face.

1844
01:48:37.765 --> 01:48:39.676
Bow. En garde.

1845
01:48:40.809 --> 01:48:41.969
Fight!

1846
01:48:48.275 --> 01:48:49.435
Referee: Back on your line.

1847
01:48:49.526 --> 01:48:50.806
Ali: Be tough, Daniel. Be tough.

1848
01:48:50.861 --> 01:48:52.647
No point. En garde.

1849
01:48:53.155 --> 01:48:54.270
Fight!

1850
01:48:54.365 --> 01:48:55.571
Ali: Come on. Be tough!

1851
01:48:58.118 --> 01:49:00.234
Daniel-San, remember your defense.

1852
01:49:00.329 --> 01:49:02.661
Points come. Concentrate. Focus power.

1853
01:49:02.748 --> 01:49:04.864
Remember balance. Make good fight.

1854
01:49:06.919 --> 01:49:08.455
Warning for running out of the ring.

1855
01:49:08.545 --> 01:49:10.001
Once more will cost you a point.

1856
01:49:10.089 --> 01:49:11.795
En garde. Ready?

1857
01:49:14.843 --> 01:49:15.843
Fight!

1858
01:49:20.557 --> 01:49:22.843
All right, Daniel, that's one. Come on!

1859
01:49:25.187 --> 01:49:26.472
One more.

1860
01:49:27.356 --> 01:49:28.971
Referee: Come back on your line.

1861
01:49:29.984 --> 01:49:32.145
That's one point, round kick.

1862
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:35.777
All right, Daniel!
You're the best! You're the best!

1863
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:40.066
Try to be best 'cause you're only a man

1864
01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.321
and a man's got to learn to take it

1865
01:49:42.413 --> 01:49:45.200
try to believe
though the goin' gets rough

1866
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:47.622
that you got to hang tough to make it

1867
01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:50.702
history repeats itself

1868
01:49:50.796 --> 01:49:51.956
try and you'll succeed

1869
01:49:52.047 --> 01:49:53.708
you're history, man! You're dead!

1870
01:49:53.799 --> 01:49:55.335
Never doubt that you're the one

1871
01:49:55.426 --> 01:49:57.917
and you can have your dream

1872
01:49:58.012 --> 01:50:00.219

1873
01:50:00.305 --> 01:50:02.637
nothing's gonna ever keep you down

1874
01:50:02.725 --> 01:50:05.341
you're the best around

1875
01:50:05.436 --> 01:50:08.223

referee: Hall

1879
01:50:18.323 --> 01:50:20.234
fight to the end
'cause you'll have to depend

1880
01:50:20.576 --> 01:50:23.693
on the strength that you find inside you

1881
01:50:23.787 --> 01:50:25.152
point. Winner.

1882
01:50:28.333 --> 01:50:30.915
Try your best to win them all

1883
01:50:31.003 --> 01:50:32.994
in a world that's hard to tell

1884
01:50:33.088 --> 01:50:36.000
when you're the one
that's standing there

1885
01:50:36.091 --> 01:50:37.956
you've reached the final bell

1886
01:50:38.052 --> 01:50:40.839

point. Winner.

1901
01:51:39.113 --> 01:51:40.978
Fight till you drop

and never stop you can't give up

1903
01:51:44.159 --> 01:51:46.525

you are the best in town

1905
01:51:49.706 --> 01:51:51.071
listen to that sound

1906
01:51:51.166 --> 01:51:54.158

Oh, must be tight.

Yeah, right there.

1922
01:52:35.002 --> 01:52:36.458
Never thought I'd get this far.

1923
01:52:36.545 --> 01:52:37.625
That make two of us.

1924
01:52:37.713 --> 01:52:39.294
Wouldn't it be great if I won?

1925
01:52:39.381 --> 01:52:41.121
Be great you survive.

1926
01:52:41.216 --> 01:52:42.672
Survive? What do you mean, survive?

1927
01:52:42.759 --> 01:52:43.862
Hey, you sure you're okay?
“What?

1928
01:52:43.886 --> 01:52:45.547
Yeah, I'm fine. As long as I don't move.

1929

Yeah, we gotta move now, come on,

Daniel, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean it!

1973
01:55:37.809 --> 01:55:39.765
My leg! No!

1974
01:55:39.895 --> 01:55:43.808
My leg hurts, Mr. miyagi! My leg hurts.

1975
01:55:43.899 --> 01:55:45.981
Miyagi here, Daniel-San. Okay.

1976
01:55:46.068 --> 01:55:47.729
Miyagi here, okay.

I'll inform the judges.

You did well out there, young man.

1985
01:56:23.563 --> 01:56:24.563
Damn it!

1986
01:56:24.648 --> 01:56:29.017
Honey, forget it. Hey, you were great!

1987
01:56:29.903 --> 01:56:31.518
I couldn't be prouder.

1988
01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:34.020
It was just bad luck.

1989
01:56:34.116 --> 01:56:36.778
Daniel, you would have won
if they hadn't cheated.

1990
01:56:36.868 --> 01:56:39.359
Just leave me alone for a minute, okay?

1991
01:56:39.454 --> 01:56:40.944
We'll be outside.

1992
01:56:46.253 --> 01:56:47.743
Uh, Mr. miyagi...

1993
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:50.589
Hmm.

1994
01:56:50.674 --> 01:56:52.881
You think I had a chance at winning?

1995
01:56:52.968 --> 01:56:54.458
Win, lose, no matter.

1996
01:56:54.553 --> 01:56:56.544
No, that's not what I mean.

1997
01:56:59.474 --> 01:57:00.474
Hey,

1998
01:57:01.226 --> 01:57:02.966
had good chance.

1999
01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:07.308
Well, can you fix my leg,
I mean, with that thing you do?

2000
01:57:07.399 --> 01:57:10.812
No need fight anymore. You prove point.

2001
01:57:10.902 --> 01:57:13.484
What point? That I can take a beating?

2002
01:57:13.572 --> 01:57:15.012
I mean, every time I see those guys,

2003
01:57:19.161 --> 01:57:23.495
I'll never have balance that way.
Not with them, not with Ali.

2004
01:57:27.127 --> 01:57:28.412
Not with me.

2005
01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.875
Hmm.

2006
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:34.380

2007
01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:38.505

We did it! We did it! All right!

2083
02:03:40.166 --> 02:03:42.953
When you're alone

2084
02:03:43.044 --> 02:03:46.662
you ask yourself

2085
02:03:47.882 --> 02:03:52.046
what are you searching for

2086
02:03:54.138 --> 02:03:57.130
deep in the night

2087
02:03:57.225 --> 02:04:00.763
a dream is born

2088
02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:06.724
one that you can't ignore

2089
02:04:07.569 --> 02:04:11.153
if you think you can find the passion

2090
02:04:11.239 --> 02:04:14.652
and you're ready to take a chance

2091
02:04:14.742 --> 02:04:18.075
if you really believe you can make it

2092
02:04:18.162 --> 02:04:21.404
then the power is in your own hands

2093
02:04:21.499 --> 02:04:23.615
it's the moment of truth

2094
02:04:23.710 --> 02:04:25.325
you're giving it all

2095
02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:28.878
standing alone, willing to fall

2096
02:04:28.965 --> 02:04:30.671
if you can do it

2097
02:04:30.758 --> 02:04:32.464
get up and prove it

2098
02:04:32.552 --> 02:04:35.510
get up and show them who you are

2099
02:04:35.597 --> 02:04:39.260
it's the moment of truth,
it's all on the line

2100
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:42.763
this is the place, this is the time

2101

it's now or it's never

2102
02:04:46.482 --> 02:04:49.724
nothing can stop you now

2103
02:04:53.364 --> 02:04:56.447
once in your life

2104
02:04:56.534 --> 02:04:59.992
you make a choice

2105
02:05:01.289 --> 02:05:05.202
ready to risk it all

2106
02:05:07.337 --> 02:05:10.204
