1
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.271
Bio readouts are all in the green.
Looks like she's alive.

2
00:05:07.765 --> 00:05:10.767
Well, there goes
our salvage, guys.

3
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:40.339
- How are we today?
- Terrible.

4
00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:43.300
Well, better than
yesterday, at least.

5
00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:46.136
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

6
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.638
You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

7
00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:52.142
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're okay.

8
00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:54.728
Looks like you've got a visitor.

9
00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.940
Jonesy. Come here.

10
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.235
Hey, come here.

11
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.696
How are you, you stupid cat?

12
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.700
How are you? Where have you been?

13
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:12.621
- Guess you two have met?
- I'm Burke. Carter Burke.

14
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:17.250
I work for the company, but don't let
that fool you. I'm really an okay guy.

15
00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.462
I'm glad to see you're
feeling a little better.

16
00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:24.091
They tell me that all the weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

17
00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:30.097
That's just natural side effects of such an
unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.

18
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:32.349
What do you mean?

19
00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.810
How long was I out there?

20
00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:36.978
Inhalation Therapy, report to-

21
00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.314
Has no one discussed
this with you yet?

22
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.400
No. But, I mean...

23
00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:45.487
I don't... recognize this place.

24
00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.572
No, I know. Uh-

25
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:51.368
Okay. It's just that,
this might be a shock to you.

26
00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:54.079
- It's long-
- How long?

27
00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:56.164
Please.

28
00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:01.128
- 57 years.
- What?

29
00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:05.465
That's the thing.
You were out there for 57 years.

30
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.677
What happened was you had drifted
right through the core systems.

31
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:11.596
And it's really
just blind luck...

32
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.891
that a deep-salvage team
found you when they did.

33
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.269
It's one in a thousand, really.

34
00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:22.065
I think you're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.
You could be floating out there forever.

35
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.360
You-You okay?

36
00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.536
Uuh!

37
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.872
You okay?

38
00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:46.214
Oh-h-h! God!

39
00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:51.178
- Nurse! Please!
- God!

40
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.264
Someone get in here now!

41
00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:56.391
Now!

42
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.685
- Hold!
- Please.

43
00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.979
Hold on!

44
00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:03.064
Kill me!

45
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.659
No!

46
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:23.585
Bad dreams again?
You want something to help you sleep?

47
00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.921
No.

48
00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.006
I've slept enough.

49
00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.177
Jonesy.

50
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.262
Come here.

51
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.431
Shh.

52
00:08:40.728 --> 00:08:42.729
It's all right.

53
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:47.526
It's all right now.

54
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.653
It's over.

55
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.991
I'd just like to go, -

56
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.244
back to this point about
the override destruct order.

57
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.914
- Is it in the file?
- I don't understand this.

58
00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:03.500
We have been here
for three and a half hours.

59
00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:05.752
Now, how many different ways do
you want me to tell the same story?

60
00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:11.758
Look at it from our
perspective, please.

61
00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:13.843
Please?

62
00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.723
Now, you freely admit to
detonating the engines of,

63
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.643
and thereby destroying,
an M-class starfreighter,

64
00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.187
a rather expensive piece
of hardware.

65
00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:27.482
Forty-two million
in adjusted dollars.

66
00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:30.318
That's minus payload, of course.

67
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:34.781
The lifeboat's flight recorder
corroborates some elements of your account,

68
00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:39.911
in that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down on LV-426,

69
00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:44.541
an unsurveyed planet at that time,
that it resumed its course...

70
00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:49.546
and was subsequently set for
self-destruct by you for reasons unknown.

71
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.965
Not for reasons unknown.
I told you.

72
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:57.804
We set down there on company orders to
get this thing, which destroyed my crew...

73
00:09:57.888 --> 00:10:00.348
and your expensive ship.

74
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:04.102
The analysis team, which went over
the lifeboat centimeter by centimeter,

75
00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:07.314
found no physical evidence
of the creature you describe.

76
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:11.443
Good! That's because I blew it
out of the goddamn air lock,

77
00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:15.196
like I said.

78
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:21.536
Are there any species like this
hostile organism on LV-426?

79
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.122
No. It's a rock.
No indigenous life.

80
00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:29.711
Did I.Q.'s just drop sharply
while I was away?

81
00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.172
Ma'am, I already said
it was not indigenous.

82
00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:35.008
It was a derelict spacecraft.
It was an alien ship.

83
00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:39.679
It was not from there. Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

84
00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.557
And found something
never recorded once...

85
00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:46.144
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

86
00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:50.025
"A creature that gestates
inside a living human host."

87
00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:51.049
Yes.

88
00:10:51.108 --> 00:10:55.028
These are your words.
"And has concentrated acid for blood."

89
00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:57.364
That's right.

90
00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:01.368
Look. I can see
where this is going,

91
00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:03.870
but I'm telling you
that those things exist.

92
00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:07.165
- Thank you, Officer Ripley. That will be all.
- Please. You're not listening to me.

93
00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:09.751
Kane, the crew member-

94
00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:13.546
Kane, who went into that ship,
said he saw thousands of eggs there.

95
00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:15.715
- Thousands.
- Thank you. That will be all.

96
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.842
Goddamn it, that's not all!

97
00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:21.638
Because if one of those things gets down
here, then that will be all!

98
00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:24.265
Then all of this- this bullshit
that you think is so important-

99
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.144
You can just kiss
all of that good-bye!

100
00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:45.662
That could have been better.

101
00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:49.249
- Look, I think the- Ripley?
- Van Leuwen.

102
00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:52.585
Why don't you
just check out LV-426?

103
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.423
Because I don't have to.
There have been people there for over 20 years,

104
00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.382
and they never complained
about any hostile organism.

105
00:11:59.408 --> 00:12:01.244
What do you mean? What people?

106
00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:04.431
Terraformers. Planet engineers.

107
00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:08.226
They go in, set up these big atmosphere
processors to make the air breathable.

108
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.603
Takes decades.

109
00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:12.939
It's what we call
a "Shake 'N Bake" colony.

110
00:12:13.023 --> 00:12:16.651
How many are there?
How many colonists?

111
00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:21.239
- I don't know-60, maybe 70 families.
- Do you mind?

112
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.910
Families.

113
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.165
Jesus.

114
00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:08.995
Hiya, Ripley.
This is Lieutenant Gorman...

115
00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:12.207
of the Colonial Marine Corps-

116
00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.542
Ripley, we have to talk.

117
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:18.338
We've lost contact
with the colony on LV-426.

118
00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:27.013
I don't believe this.

119
00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:31.684
You guys throw me at the wolves,
and now you want me to go back out there?

120
00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.354
Forget it. It's not my problem.

121
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.066
- Can I finish?
- No. There's no way.

122
00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:41.569
Ripley, you wouldn't be
going in with the troops.

123
00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.988
I can guarantee your safety.

124
00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:46.574
These Colonial Marines
are very tough hombres.

125
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.536
They're packing
state-of-the-art firepower.

126
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.787
There's nothing
they can't handle.

127
00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:54.569
- Lieutenant, am I right?
- That's true.

128
00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:56.821
We've been trained to deal
with situations like this.

129
00:13:56.905 --> 00:14:00.533
Then you don't need me.
I'm not a soldier.

130
00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:03.244
Yeah, but we don't know exactly
what's going on out there.

131
00:14:03.328 --> 00:14:05.913
It may just be a downed
transmitter, okay?

132
00:14:05.998 --> 00:14:10.460
But if it's not,
I would like you there as an adviser,

133
00:14:10.544 --> 00:14:12.462
and that's all.

134
00:14:12.546 --> 00:14:15.465
Look, I don't have time for this.
I've got to get going, go to work.

135
00:14:15.549 --> 00:14:18.718
Right. I heard you're
working the cargo docks.

136
00:14:18.802 --> 00:14:20.761
That's right.

137
00:14:20.888 --> 00:14:22.921
Running loaders and
forklifts, that sort of thing?

138
00:14:22.947 --> 00:14:23.623
Yeah. So?

139
00:14:23.682 --> 00:14:26.809
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

140
00:14:26.894 --> 00:14:29.437
And I know it's the only
thing that you could get.

141
00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:31.355
There's nothing wrong with it.

142
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.000
What would you say if I told you
I could get you reinstated...

143
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:39.043
as a flight officer?

144
00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:42.516
The company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.

145
00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:43.656
If I go.

146
00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.676
Yeah, if you go.

147
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.928
Come on.
That's a second chance, kiddo.

148
00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:51.764
I think, personally, for you,
it would be the best thing in the world...

149
00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.726
to get out there and face this
thing, get back on the horse.

150
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.729
Spare me, Burke.
I've had my psych evaluation this month.

151
00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:01.941
Yeah, I know. I've read it. You wake up every
night. Your sheets are soaking with sweat-

152
00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:04.277
I said no, and I mean it!

153
00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.949
Now, please leave.
I am not going back.

154
00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:13.369
And I am-I would not be
any good to you if I did.

155
00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:16.539
Okay. Shh.

156
00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.461
Would you do me a favor?
Just think about it.

157
00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:26.591
Thanks for the coffee.

158
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.577
Hello.

159
00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.372
Ripley.

160
00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:43.042
- You okay?
- Just tell me one thing, Burke.

161
00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:46.421
You're going out there
to destroy them, right?

162
00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:51.426
Not to study, not to bring back,
but to wipe them out.

163
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.555
That's the plan.
You have my word on it.

164
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.308
All right. I'm in.

165
00:17:00.727 --> 00:17:01.310
I think that-

166
00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.821
And you, you little shithead,

167
00:17:11.905 --> 00:17:14.740
you're staying here.

168
00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:43.538
They ain't payin' us
enough for this, man.

169
00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.790
Not enough to have to wake
up to your face, Drake.

170
00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:46.541
What?

171
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.210
Is that a joke?

172
00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:51.379
I wish it were.

173
00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:56.384
Hey, Hicks. Man, you look
just like I feel.

174
00:18:56.468 --> 00:19:00.346
All right, sweethearts.
What are you waiting for?

175
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.558
Breakfast in bed?
Another glorious day in the corps.

176
00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:07.144
A day in the Marine Corps
is like a day on the farm-

177
00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:12.191
every meal's a banquet, every paycheck a
fortune, every formation a parade.

178
00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:13.985
- I love the corps!
- Christ!

179
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:15.903
Man, this floor is freezing!

180
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:18.443
What do you want me to do?
Fetch your slippers for ya?

181
00:19:18.469 --> 00:19:20.224
Gee, would you, sir?
I'd like that.

182
00:19:20.284 --> 00:19:23.536
Look into my eye.
Fall in, people.

183
00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.871
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

184
00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:27.915
I hate this job.

185
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:30.710
- Crowe, Wierzbowski. Come on. On your feet.
- We got some slack coming, right?

186
00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:33.671
You had three weeks on your back, Frost.
What do you want?

187
00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:36.132
I'm talking about breathing,
not this frozen shit.

188
00:19:36.216 --> 00:19:38.509
Yeah, Top. How 'bout it?

189
00:19:41.638 --> 00:19:45.808
All right. First assembly's
in 15, people. Shag it.

190
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.687
Hey, Mira. Who's Snow White?

191
00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:53.232
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

192
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:55.568
Apparently,
she saw an alien once.

193
00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:58.696
Whoopee-fuckin'-do!
Hey, I'm impressed.

194
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.823
¡Que bonita!

195
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.288
Hey, Vasquez.
Have you ever been mistaken for a man?

196
00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:09.415
No. Have you?

197
00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:14.337
Ha, ha! Vasquez.
You're just too bad.

198
00:20:25.182 --> 00:20:27.725
Hey, Top, what's the op?

199
00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:29.935
It's a rescue mission.
You'll love it.

200
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.732
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity.

201
00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:36.984
Dumb-ass colonists.

202
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:43.199
- What's this crap supposed to be?
- Vasquez.

203
00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:46.410
- Corn bread, I think.
- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

204
00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.497
Hey, sure wouldn't mind getting some
more of that Arcturian poontang.

205
00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:54.710
- Remember that time?
- Yeah. Except the one that you had was male.

206
00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:57.380
Doesn't matter
when it's Arcturian.

207
00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:59.924
- Hey, Bishop, man. Do the thing with the knife.
- Please.

208
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.468
Oh, come on. Yeah.

209
00:21:02.552 --> 00:21:04.512
All right! Yeah.

210
00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:08.182
- I don't want to see that, man.
- Come on, man. All right. All right.

211
00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:11.227
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

212
00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:13.479
- Come on. Quit messing around, Drake.
- Hudson, shut up!

213
00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:16.148
- Bishop, hey, man.
- Do it, Bishop!

214
00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:19.819
- Hey! Not me, man! Quit messing around!
- Yeah, you! Don't move.

215
00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:22.196
Trust me.

216
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.408
Aah!

217
00:21:33.917 --> 00:21:36.877
All right. Knock it off,
knock it off.

218
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:38.963
Thank you.

219
00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:43.426
- There you go, short shit.
- Enjoy your meal.

220
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:46.262
That wasn't funny, man.

221
00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:52.935
- Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?
- Yeah, thanks.

222
00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:58.190
Looks like the new lieutenant's too
good to eat with the rest of us grunts.

223
00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:02.778
Boy's definitely got
a corncob up his ass.

224
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:06.574
Thought you never miss, Bishop.

225
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.663
You never said anything about an
android being on board. Why not?

226
00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:16.792
It never- never occurred to me.

227
00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:19.962
It's just common practice.
We always have a synthetic on board.

228
00:22:20.046 --> 00:22:22.506
I prefer the term
"artificial person" myself.

229
00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:24.467
Right.

230
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:27.219
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.

231
00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:29.221
I don't know why I didn't even-

232
00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:32.725
Ripley's last trip out,
the syn-the artificial person malfunctioned.

233
00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:34.029
Malfunctioned?

234
00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:37.713
There were problems and
a few deaths were involved.

235
00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:40.983
I'm shocked.
Was it an older model?

236
00:22:41.067 --> 00:22:43.736
The Hyperdyne Systems

237
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.405
That explains it then.
The A2s always were a bit twitchy.

238
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.200
That could never happen now
with our behavioral inhibitors.

239
00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:53.871
It is impossible for me to harm, or by omission
of action, allow to be harmed, a human being.

240
00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:58.167
- You sure you don't want some?

241
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:00.836
You just stay away from me,
Bishop. You got that straight?

242
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:06.967
Guess she don't like
the corn bread, either.

243
00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:24.443
Squad, ten-hut!
Officer on deck! As you were.

244
00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:27.363
Quickly, quickly. Settle down.

245
00:23:27.447 --> 00:23:30.449
All right. Listen up!

246
00:23:30.534 --> 00:23:35.579
Morning, marines. I'm sorry we didn't have time
to brief you people before we left Gateway-

247
00:23:35.705 --> 00:23:38.165
- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?

248
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.335
Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.

249
00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:44.338
What's the question?

250
00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:48.217
Is this gonna be a stand-up
fight, sir, or another bug hunt?

251
00:23:48.301 --> 00:23:52.388
All we know is that there's still
no contact with the colony...

252
00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:55.307
and that a xenomorph
may be involved.

253
00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:58.143
- Excuse me, sir. A what?
- A xenomorph.

254
00:23:58.228 --> 00:24:00.479
It's a bug hunt.

255
00:24:00.564 --> 00:24:05.276
- What exactly are we dealing with here?
- Ripley.

256
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.778
I'll tell you what I know.

257
00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:10.281
We set down on LV-426.

258
00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:14.368
One of our crew members was brought back on
board with something attached to his face,

259
00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:16.954
some kind of parasite.

260
00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:19.373
We tried to get it off.
It wouldn't come off.

261
00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:22.376
Later, it seemed to come off
by itself and die.

262
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.004
Kane seemed fine.

263
00:24:25.088 --> 00:24:27.214
We were all having dinner,
and, um,

264
00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:31.427
it must have laid something inside his
throat, some sort of embryo.

265
00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:35.514
- He started-Um, he-
- Look, man.

266
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:40.644
I only need to know one
thing- where they are.

267
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.522
- Yo, Vasquez.
- Kick ass. Anytime, anywhere.

268
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:48.444
Right, right. Somebody said "alien." She
thought they said "illegal alien" and signed up.

269
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.529
- Fuck you, man.
- Anytime, anywhere.

270
00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:53.240
Are you finished?

271
00:24:58.413 --> 00:25:01.123
I hope you're right.
I really do.

272
00:25:03.376 --> 00:25:06.420
Yeah, okay, right.
Thank you, Ripley.

273
00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:09.423
We also have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

274
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:14.428
Because just one of those things managed to
wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

275
00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:17.264
And if the colonists have found that
ship, then there's no telling...

276
00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:19.016
how many of them
have been exposed.

277
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.518
Do you understand?

278
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:26.523
Anyway, we have it on disk,
so you better look at it.

279
00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:29.276
Any questions?

280
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.737
What is it, Private?

281
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:34.823
How do I get out of this
chickenshit outfit?

282
00:25:34.908 --> 00:25:36.659
You secure that shit, Hudson.

283
00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:41.413
All right.

284
00:25:41.498 --> 00:25:44.333
Now listen up.

285
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.836
I want this thing
to go smooth...

286
00:25:47.921 --> 00:25:50.464
and by the numbers.

287
00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:54.969
I want D.C.S. and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.

288
00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:58.055
Ordinance loading, weapons strip
and drop-ship prep details...

289
00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:00.557
- will have seven hours.
- Oh, come on.

290
00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:02.810
Now, move it, people!

291
00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:05.604
All right, sweethearts.
You heard the man, and you know the drill.

292
00:26:05.689 --> 00:26:09.900
Assholes and elbows!
Hudson, come here. Come here.

293
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:27.126
I don't care if you are short, Hudson.
Get it done.

294
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.795
Hey, Sarge.
You'll get lip cancer smoking those.

295
00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:33.007
Corporal, I want this
loading lock sealed. Now!

296
00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:35.551
- How many more you got, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

297
00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:37.678
Good. Take it away.

298
00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:57.197
Clear behind.

299
00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:05.998
Did you check number three?
Let me see that.

300
00:27:06.082 --> 00:27:10.002
Hi. I feel like kind of a fifth wheel around here.
Is there anything I can do?

301
00:27:10.086 --> 00:27:12.463
I don't know.
ls there anything you can do?

302
00:27:15.425 --> 00:27:17.676
Well, I can drive that loader.

303
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:21.430
I have a Class 2 rating.

304
00:27:21.514 --> 00:27:23.599
Be my guest.

305
00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:13.065
Where you want it?

306
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:16.610
Bay 12, please.

307
00:29:12.959 --> 00:29:16.420
All right, sweethearts.
We're a team, and there's nothing to worry about.

308
00:29:16.504 --> 00:29:20.007
We come here, and we gonna
conquer, and we gonna kick some.

309
00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:22.291
Is that understood?
That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.

310
00:29:22.317 --> 00:29:23.035
Yes, sir.

311
00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:25.429
- We are going to go and get some.
- Hey.

312
00:29:25.513 --> 00:29:28.265
All right, people!
On the ready line!

313
00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:31.143
- Are you lean? Are you mean?
- Yeah! Yeah!

314
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.896
- What are you? What are you?
- Lean and mean!

315
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.773
Hudson!
Get on the ready line, marine!

316
00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:39.776
Get some today!
Get on the ready line!

317
00:29:39.903 --> 00:29:42.821
- Yo!
- Move it out! Move it out, goddamn it!

318
00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:46.491
Get hot! One, two, three!
Get out, get out, get out!

319
00:29:46.576 --> 00:29:50.120
Move it out, move it out, move it out!
Move it out, move it out, move it out!

320
00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:56.501
Absolutely badasses.

321
00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:59.004
Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!

322
00:29:59.088 --> 00:30:01.048
All right! Move it!

323
00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.842
- Let's go, let's go!
- One, two, three,

324
00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:07.387
four, five, six!

325
00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:11.850
All right. I want combat seating.
You know your places.

326
00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:14.228
Get those weapons stowed.
Let's go.

327
00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:17.648
Come on. Settle down, people.

328
00:30:17.732 --> 00:30:19.816
Lock 'em in, Hudson.

329
00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:23.320
Ready to get it on? You know it!

330
00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:26.073
Okay, Bishop, let's go.

331
00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:28.325
Roger.

332
00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:32.829
I'm ready, man.

333
00:30:32.956 --> 00:30:36.458
- Ready to get it on! Go!

334
00:30:40.588 --> 00:30:44.591
Stand by. Cross-locking now.
Prelaunch autocycle engaged.

335
00:30:47.845 --> 00:30:51.848
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

336
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:06.113
- Shit, man.
- Confirm cross-lock and drop stations secured.

337
00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:10.325
Affirmative.
All drop stations secured.

338
00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:16.540
Stand by. Ten seconds.

339
00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:23.213
Stand by to initiate release sequencer...
on my mark.

340
00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:27.968
- Five, four, three, - We're on an
express elevator to hell, going down.

341
00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:31.013
Two, one, mark.

342
00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:34.558
Woo-hoo!

343
00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:51.199
- Switch to D.C.S. ranging.
- 240, nominal to profile.

344
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:53.994
We're in the pipe, five by five.

345
00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:06.882
We're picking up
some hull ionization.

346
00:32:06.966 --> 00:32:09.426
Got it. Rough air ahead.

347
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.762
We're in for some chop.

348
00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:27.736
How many drops is this
for you, Lieutenant?

349
00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:32.491
Thirty-eight.

350
00:32:32.575 --> 00:32:34.534
Simulated.

351
00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.745
How many combat drops?

352
00:32:36.829 --> 00:32:40.874
Two... including this one.

353
00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:44.294
- Shit.
- Man!

354
00:32:56.974 --> 00:33:01.186
Range 014. Turning on final.

355
00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:08.944
And I'm telling you,
I got a bad feeling about this drop.

356
00:33:09.028 --> 00:33:12.447
You always say that, Frost. You always
say, "I got a bad feeling about this drop."

357
00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:14.950
Okay, okay.
When we get back without you,

358
00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:18.078
I'll call your folks.

359
00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:24.459
All right.
Let's see what we can see.

360
00:33:24.544 --> 00:33:28.004
Everybody online. Looking good.

361
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.134
Drake, check your camera.
There seems to be a malfunction.

362
00:33:33.538 --> 00:33:36.873
That's better.
Pan it around a bit.

363
00:33:36.958 --> 00:33:40.836
- Good.
- All right, gear up.

364
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.715
Two minutes, people. Get hot.

365
00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:46.550
Somebody wake up Hicks.

366
00:34:00.064 --> 00:34:02.482
Coming around for a 709er.

367
00:34:02.609 --> 00:34:05.485
- Terminal guidance locked in.
- Where's the damn beacon?

368
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.071
I see it.

369
00:34:14.203 --> 00:34:17.539
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- Yep, that's it.

370
00:34:17.624 --> 00:34:20.917
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

371
00:34:21.002 --> 00:34:23.503
You know, we manufacture
those, by the way.

372
00:34:33.181 --> 00:34:38.352
Okay, Ferro.
Hake us in low over the main colony complex.

373
00:34:40.063 --> 00:34:42.189
Storm shutters are sealed.

374
00:34:42.273 --> 00:34:44.816
There's no visible activity.
All right. Hold at 40.

375
00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:49.044
- Roger.
- Give me a slow circle of the complex.

376
00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:01.264
Structure seems intact.
They still have power.

377
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:05.560
Okay, Ferro.
Set down on the landing grid.

378
00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:08.563
Immediate dust off on my
clear, then stay on station.

379
00:35:22.578 --> 00:35:24.913
Down and clear.

380
00:35:26.082 --> 00:35:28.250
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.

381
00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:34.631
All right. I want a nice,
clean dispersal this time.

382
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.385
Let's go! Move it out!

383
00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:40.470
Head 'em up!

384
00:36:01.367 --> 00:36:05.578
First squad up on line.
Hicks, get yours in accord and watch the rear.

385
00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:09.291
Vasquez, take point. Let's move!

386
00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.633
Move up.

387
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:23.596
Hudson, run a bypass.

388
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.938
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

389
00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.733
Second squad on line.

390
00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:04.846
You set?

391
00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.893
Go on.

392
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:38.254
Second team, move inside.
Hicks, take the upper level.

393
00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:11.287
Sir, you copying this? Looks
like hits from small-arms fire.

394
00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:14.457
We got some explosives damage.

395
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:16.793
It's probably seismic
survey charges.

396
00:38:16.877 --> 00:38:20.672
Are you reading this?
Keep it tight, people.

397
00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:37.897
All right. Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

398
00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:59.043
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.

399
00:39:03.966 --> 00:39:06.801
Quarter and search by twos.

400
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.191
Okay. Dietrich,
Frost, you're up.

401
00:39:59.146 --> 00:40:02.106
Wait. Wait, tell him to-

402
00:40:03.108 --> 00:40:06.819
Hicks, back up. Pan right.

403
00:40:07.988 --> 00:40:13.576
- There.
- You seeing this all right?

404
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:19.207
Looks melted. Somebody must have
bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.

405
00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:21.251
Acid for blood.

406
00:40:21.335 --> 00:40:24.921
if you like that,
you're gonna love this.

407
00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.811
Quit screwing around.

408
00:40:39.895 --> 00:40:41.646
Second squad,
what's your status?

409
00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.857
We just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.

410
00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:47.527
Roger. Sir, this place is dead.

411
00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:50.238
Whatever happened here,
I think we missed it.

412
00:40:50.322 --> 00:40:54.325
All right. The area's secured. Let's go in
and see what their computer can tell us.

413
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:57.245
- Wait a minute. It's not secure.
- The area's secured, Ripley.

414
00:40:57.329 --> 00:40:59.122
First team, head for operations.

415
00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.529
- Hudson, see if you can get their C.P.U. on line.
- Affirmative.

416
00:41:03.655 --> 00:41:06.251
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

417
00:41:06.277 --> 00:41:07.141
Roger.

418
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.494
He's comin' in.
I feel safer already.

419
00:41:10.578 --> 00:41:12.621
Pendejo jerk-off.

420
00:41:24.064 --> 00:41:28.067
Sir, they sealed off
this wing at both ends,

421
00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:31.404
welded the doors and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

422
00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:35.491
- Mm-hmm - But it looks like
the barricade didn't hold.

423
00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:37.744
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

424
00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.746
Last stand.

425
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.290
Must have been
a hell of a fight.

426
00:41:42.374 --> 00:41:45.001
Yeah, looks that way.

427
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.047
All right, Drake, this way.

428
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:52.133
We should be able to cut through
the medlab to Operations.

429
00:42:43.936 --> 00:42:45.853
Lieutenant.

430
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.691
Gorman.

431
00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.251
Are those the same ones that-

432
00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:23.558
Careful, Burke.

433
00:43:33.152 --> 00:43:37.071
Looks like love
at first sight to me.

434
00:43:37.156 --> 00:43:39.490
He likes you, Burke.

435
00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:42.201
Two are alive.
The rest are dead.

436
00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:47.039
"Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

437
00:43:47.124 --> 00:43:51.836
Subject Marachek, John J.,
died during the procedure."

438
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.338
They killed him taking it off.

439
00:43:54.423 --> 00:43:58.593
Yo, Hicks.

440
00:43:58.677 --> 00:44:01.220
I think we got something here.

441
00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.935
- Behind us.
- One of us?

442
00:44:09.229 --> 00:44:12.732
Apone, where are your people?
Anybody in "D" block?

443
00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:15.651
That's a negative.
We're all in Operations.

444
00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:20.698
Talk to me, Frosty.

445
00:44:20.783 --> 00:44:22.742
Let's keep moving, baby.

446
00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:43.137
- It's moving.
- Which way?

447
00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:46.766
It's coming straight for us.
Straight up.

448
00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:26.264
- Fuck!
- Hold up.

449
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.350
Ripley.

450
00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:51.956
Hey. Shh. It's all right.

451
00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:54.333
- It's all right. Come on.
- Just grab her, Corporal.

452
00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:57.503
Don't be afraid. Come on.
We won't hurt you.

453
00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:59.881
Shh. It's all right. It's okay.

454
00:45:59.965 --> 00:46:02.133
Come on out. Come on.

455
00:46:02.217 --> 00:46:04.302
- Easy. Easy.
- I got her.

456
00:46:04.386 --> 00:46:06.304
Damn!

457
00:46:06.388 --> 00:46:09.140
- Watch her!
- She's under the grille! Don't let her go.

458
00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:12.560
- Frost, get your light up here.
- Where'd she go?

459
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.275
- Shine the light.
- Here. Here.

460
00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:21.110
- Here. Here.
- There she is.

461
00:46:21.194 --> 00:46:23.779
Keep back. Keep back.
Don't scare her.

462
00:46:23.906 --> 00:46:26.574
Grab her, man.
We're gonna lose her. Damn it!

463
00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:30.786
Kick it out!

464
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.999
Wait.

465
00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:03.611
It's okay. It's all right.

466
00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:08.407
Don't be afraid.

467
00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:10.534
See?

468
00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.578
- Wait.
- No, you don't.

469
00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:16.123
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right now.

470
00:47:16.208 --> 00:47:18.292
Shh.

471
00:47:18.377 --> 00:47:22.546
Easy. Easy. It's gonna be okay.

472
00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:25.132
It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.

473
00:47:25.217 --> 00:47:27.259
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

474
00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:30.429
Easy. Easy.

475
00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:08.926
- What's her name again?
- Rebecca.

476
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:12.972
Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

477
00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:15.891
Just start at the beginning.

478
00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:19.020
Where are your parents?

479
00:48:19.104 --> 00:48:21.313
Now, look, Rebecca,
you have to try and help-

480
00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:24.025
Gorman, give it a rest,
why don't you?

481
00:48:26.361 --> 00:48:29.113
Total brain lock.

482
00:48:29.197 --> 00:48:31.115
Physically, she's okay.

483
00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:34.410
Borderline malnutrition,
but I don't think there's any permanent damage.

484
00:48:34.494 --> 00:48:36.912
Come on. We're wasting our time.

485
00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:48.799
Try this.

486
00:48:48.884 --> 00:48:51.218
It's a little hot chocolate.

487
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:55.139
There you go.

488
00:48:55.223 --> 00:48:57.433
Whoop.

489
00:48:57.517 --> 00:48:59.477
That good?

490
00:49:03.857 --> 00:49:07.318
I made a clean spot here.

491
00:49:07.402 --> 00:49:11.197
Now I've done it.
Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.

492
00:49:20.749 --> 00:49:24.293
Hard to believe there's a
little girl under all this.

493
00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:28.464
And a pretty one too.

494
00:49:32.511 --> 00:49:35.096
You don't talk much, do you?

495
00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:46.065
Smoking or non-smoking?

496
00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.067
Just tell me what
you're scanning for, Private.

497
00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:50.069
- P.D.T.s.
- What?

498
00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.071
Personal data transmitters.

499
00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:54.698
Every colonist had one
surgically implanted.

500
00:49:54.783 --> 00:49:57.952
if they're within 20 klicks,
we'll read it out here.

501
00:49:58.036 --> 00:50:00.204
So far, zippo.

502
00:50:00.288 --> 00:50:03.207
I don't know how you
managed to stay alive,

503
00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:05.668
but you're one
brave kid, Rebecca.

504
00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:09.630
N-Newt.

505
00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:15.136
- What'd you say?
- Newt.

506
00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.429
My name's Newt.

507
00:50:17.514 --> 00:50:22.643
Nobody calls me Rebecca
except my brother.

508
00:50:22.727 --> 00:50:26.605
Newt? I like that.

509
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.484
I'm Ripley.
It's nice to meet you.

510
00:50:32.487 --> 00:50:35.573
And who is this?

511
00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:39.410
- Casey.
- Hello, Casey.

512
00:50:39.494 --> 00:50:42.454
What about your brother?
What's his name?

513
00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:44.582
Timmy.

514
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:49.128
Is Timmy around here too?
Maybe hiding like you were?

515
00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:54.133
Any sisters?

516
00:50:57.762 --> 00:50:59.680
Mom and dad?

517
00:51:02.517 --> 00:51:06.770
Newt, look at me.
Where are they?

518
00:51:06.855 --> 00:51:09.899
They're dead, all right?
Can I go now?

519
00:51:13.028 --> 00:51:15.487
I'm sorry, Newt.

520
00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:18.157
Don't you think you'd
be safer here with us?

521
00:51:22.037 --> 00:51:24.079
These people are here
to protect you.

522
00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:26.123
They're soldiers.

523
00:51:26.208 --> 00:51:29.043
It won't make any difference.

524
00:51:42.515 --> 00:51:44.558
Need anything else?

525
00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:50.064
Hello, Bishop. Do you
need anything else?

526
00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.984
No.

527
00:51:56.071 --> 00:51:58.197
That's a nice pet
you got there, Bishop.

528
00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:01.200
Magnificent, isn't it?

529
00:52:01.284 --> 00:52:06.288
Yo! Stop your grinnin'
and drop your linen! Found 'em.

530
00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:08.958
- They alive?
- Unknown,

531
00:52:09.042 --> 00:52:10.960
but it looks like all of them.

532
00:52:11.044 --> 00:52:15.214
Over at the processing station,
Sublevel 3,

533
00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:17.758
under the main cooling towers.

534
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.595
Looks like
a goddamn town meeting.

535
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:23.597
Let's saddle up, Apone.

536
00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:25.975
Aye, sir.

537
00:52:26.059 --> 00:52:28.644
All right. Let's go, people.
They ain't payin' us by the hour.

538
00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:30.688
Let's go. Head 'em out!

539
00:52:30.772 --> 00:52:32.773
Okay, Frost, you're driving.

540
00:52:44.577 --> 00:52:48.038
It's okay. Don't worry.
It'll be okay.

541
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.583
I want a straight "V" deployment,
second team on left flank.

542
00:53:32.667 --> 00:53:36.712
Advance on axial 664.
Tracker on line.

543
00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:39.923
Set the "V" gain
to filter R.F. ambient.

544
00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:43.510
Hudson, tracker on line.
Left and right, little buddy.

545
00:53:45.347 --> 00:53:49.516
Forty meters in, bearing 221,
there should be a stairwell.

546
00:53:49.601 --> 00:53:51.560
Check. Got it.

547
00:53:53.021 --> 00:53:54.938
You want Sublevel 3.

548
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:59.401
Let's go, people.
Hudson, you got the point.

549
00:53:59.486 --> 00:54:01.862
Hicks, watch our tails.

550
00:54:01.946 --> 00:54:05.115
Nice and easy.
Check those corners.

551
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.451
Check those corners.

552
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:13.457
- Watch your spacing.
- All right. You heard the man.

553
00:54:13.541 --> 00:54:15.459
Don't bunch up. Stay loose.

554
00:54:15.543 --> 00:54:18.295
Your transmission's
showing a lot of breakup.

555
00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.591
Probably getting some
interference from the structure.

556
00:54:22.675 --> 00:54:24.802
Use those lights.

557
00:54:24.886 --> 00:54:29.264
Next one down,
and proceed on a 216.

558
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:31.517
Roger. That's a 216.

559
00:54:33.728 --> 00:54:36.730
I'm not making that out
too well. What is it, Hudson?

560
00:54:36.815 --> 00:54:39.775
You tell me, man.
I only work here.

561
00:54:54.874 --> 00:54:56.959
What is that?

562
00:54:57.043 --> 00:54:59.253
I don't know.

563
00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:03.257
Proceed inside.

564
00:55:19.065 --> 00:55:21.942
Watch your fire
and check your targets.

565
00:55:22.026 --> 00:55:24.361
Remember we're looking
for civvies in here.

566
00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:36.081
Easy.

567
00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:38.625
Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.

568
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.713
Nice and easy.

569
00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.925
Looks like some sort
of secreted resin.

570
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:50.804
Yeah, but secreted from what?

571
00:55:50.889 --> 00:55:53.557
Nobody touch nothing.

572
00:55:53.641 --> 00:55:56.602
Busy little creatures?

573
00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.937
Hot as hell in here.

574
00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:00.939
Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.

575
00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.983
Knock it off, Hudson.

576
00:56:10.909 --> 00:56:14.244
Lieutenant, what do
those pulse rifles fire?

577
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:16.705
Ten millimeter
explosive-tip caseless.

578
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:18.749
Standard light
armor-piercing round.

579
00:56:18.833 --> 00:56:21.084
- Why?
- Well, look where your team is.

580
00:56:21.169 --> 00:56:24.421
They're right under the
primary heat exchangers.

581
00:56:24.506 --> 00:56:26.507
So?

582
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:30.302
So if they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

583
00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:34.640
- Ho, ho, ho. Yeah. She's absolutely right.
- So? So what?

584
00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:38.936
Look. This whole station is
basically a big fusion reactor.

585
00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.396
Right?

586
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:46.151
So you're talking about a thermonuclear
explosion, and adios, muchachos.

587
00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:48.862
Great. Wonderful.

588
00:56:48.947 --> 00:56:51.740
Shit!

589
00:56:53.701 --> 00:56:57.538
Look. Apone.

590
00:56:58.873 --> 00:57:02.292
Look. We can't have
any firing in there.

591
00:57:02.377 --> 00:57:06.129
I, I want you to collect
magazines from everybody.

592
00:57:06.214 --> 00:57:07.225
Is he fuckin' crazy?

593
00:57:07.251 --> 00:57:10.284
What the hell are we supposed to
use, man, harsh language?

594
00:57:10.343 --> 00:57:13.178
- Flame units only. I want rifles slung.
- Sir, I-

595
00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:16.223
Just do it, Sergeant.
And no grenades.

596
00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:22.020
All right, sweethearts. You heard the man.
Pull 'em out. Come on. Let's have 'em.

597
00:57:23.022 --> 00:57:25.732
Come on, Vasquez.
Clear and lock.

598
00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:30.904
Damn!

599
00:57:30.989 --> 00:57:33.115
You too. Give it up, Ski.
Come on. Let's go.

600
00:57:33.199 --> 00:57:36.159
Crowe, I want it now.
Give it up.

601
00:57:36.244 --> 00:57:38.203
Right on, Vas.

602
00:57:39.455 --> 00:57:41.373
Let's go, marine. Give it up.

603
00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:43.584
Frost, you got the duty.
Open that bag.

604
00:57:43.668 --> 00:57:46.545
- Thanks a lot, Sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

605
00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.547
Head 'em out, people.

606
00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:54.219
I like to keep this handy...
for close encounters.

607
00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:56.221
I heard that.

608
00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.065
Any movement?

609
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:09.818
Nothing. Zip.

610
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.958
Holy shit.

611
00:58:37.764 --> 00:58:40.265
Newt, go sit up front.

612
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.851
Go on! Now!

613
00:59:11.506 --> 00:59:14.257
Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

614
00:59:14.342 --> 00:59:17.761
We're still marines,
and we got a job to do.

615
00:59:17.845 --> 00:59:21.556
Keep it moving. Easy.

616
00:59:53.548 --> 00:59:55.173
- Help!
- What?

617
00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:58.009
Hop, get over here. We got a live one!
You're gonna be all right.

618
00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:01.263
Please... k-kill me.

619
01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:04.224
Just stay calm.
We're gonna get you outta here.

620
01:00:04.308 --> 01:00:06.893
It's gonna be all right. Give me a hand.
We gotta get her outta here.

621
01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:09.354
- What is it, Dietrich?
- Convulsion!

622
01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.107
Dietrich, get back!

623
01:00:12.191 --> 01:00:14.568
Get back!

624
01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:24.995
- No!
- Frost, flamethrower. Kill it!

625
01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:27.706
Get back! Flamethrower! Move!

626
01:00:57.528 --> 01:00:59.237
Movement!

627
01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:04.075
- What's the position?
- I can't lock in!

628
01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.536
Talk to me, Hudson!

629
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:09.790
Multiple signals.

630
01:01:09.874 --> 01:01:12.000
They're closing.

631
01:01:12.084 --> 01:01:15.378
Go to infrared, people.
Look sharp!

632
01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:18.799
What's happening, Apone?
Can't see anything in here.

633
01:01:18.883 --> 01:01:20.801
Pull your team out, Gorman.

634
01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:29.392
I got signals.
I got readings in front and behind.

635
01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.686
Where, man? I don't see shit.

636
01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.272
He's right.
There's nothing back here.

637
01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.817
Look, I'm telling you.
There's something moving, and it ain't us!

638
01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:41.863
- Shit.
- Tracker's off scale, man.

639
01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:45.242
They're all
around us, man! Jesus!

640
01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:48.245
Maybe they don't show up
on infrared at all.

641
01:01:58.506 --> 01:02:00.966
Frost!

642
01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:07.055
Come on!

643
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:16.106
Jesus Christ, Apone!
What is going on?

644
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.109
Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!

645
01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:23.238
- Dietrich, Crowe! Sound off! Frost!
- Dietrich, Frost, off the board!

646
01:02:24.657 --> 01:02:25.907
Frost!

647
01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:31.121
Wierzbowski?

648
01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:33.915
Wierzbowski?

649
01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:37.711
Let's rock!

650
01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.048
Who's firing? Goddamn it!

651
01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:44.259
Yeah!

652
01:02:44.385 --> 01:02:48.430
- I ordered to hold fire.
- They're coming out of the walls!

653
01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:50.849
They're coming out of the goddamn walls!
Let's book!

654
01:02:50.975 --> 01:02:53.184
- On the right, man.
- Uh, Apone,

655
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:56.021
I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with the incinerators-

656
01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:58.857
Vasquez, Drake,
hold your fire, goddamn it!

657
01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:02.861
Apone, are you copying me?
I want you to lay down suppressing fire...

658
01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.447
with the incinerators and fall
back by squads to the A.P.C.

659
01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:07.949
- Over.
- Say again, all after "incinerator."

660
01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:12.704
I said I want you to lay down a suppressing
fire with the incinerators and fall back...

661
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:15.373
by squads to the A.P.C. Over.

662
01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.334
Hey!

663
01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.713
- Sarge! Sarge!
- Apone.

664
01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:24.215
- Talk to me. Apone?
- Copy! Copy!

665
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.593
- Talk to me, Apone.
- He's gone!

666
01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:30.639
- Get them out of there!
- Shut up!

667
01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:33.642
- Do it now! Hicks, whoever's left, get-
- Shut up!

668
01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:35.644
- Just shut up!
- Goddamn it!

669
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:40.190
- It's coming out of the goddamn walls!
- Where's Apone? Where's Apone?

670
01:03:40.274 --> 01:03:42.567
The sarge is gone!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

671
01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:46.446
Let's move it! Let's go, marine!

672
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:49.616
Hudson? Vasquez?

673
01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:52.827
- Hudson, look out!
- Get it!

674
01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.956
Watch it!

675
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.416
- Hicks.
- Come on. Behind you! Fall back!

676
01:03:58.542 --> 01:04:02.003
- I told them to fall back.
- Fall back, goddamn it, now!

677
01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:04.005
- They're cut off!
- Hudson, move your ass!

678
01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:06.007
- Do something!
- Let's go, marine!

679
01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.051
Fuck!

680
01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:11.137
- Come on. Keep moving, baby.
- Hold on, Newt.

681
01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:20.188
Ripley, what the hell
are you doing?

682
01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.821
Turn around!

683
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.576
That's an order!

684
01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:40.542
- Get off me, damn it!
- Goddamn it, that's an order!

685
01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:43.336
You had your chance, Gorman.

686
01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:56.599
Come on!

687
01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:18.788
Come on. Let's move it!

688
01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:21.207
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

689
01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:24.753
It's blocked, man.
We gotta go around!

690
01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:29.632
- Open the door! Hicks!
- Drake, we are leaving!

691
01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:31.718
Get them, man!

692
01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.180
Run for it!

693
01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.725
Shit!

694
01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:44.731
- Go! Go!
- Come on, man! Come on!

695
01:05:52.823 --> 01:05:56.701
Drake, come on!

696
01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:01.456
No!

697
01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:06.377
- Fire in the hole!
- He's gone!

698
01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.338
Put it out! Put it out! Go! Go!

699
01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:12.133
- Come on. Put it out!
- Drake's coming, man!

700
01:06:12.259 --> 01:06:15.220
- Drake! No, he's not!
- He's gone!

701
01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.598
Forget him! He's gone!

702
01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:26.356
They're in the goddamn door!

703
01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:32.487
Eat this!

704
01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:35.657
Ripley!

705
01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:38.076
Go, go, go!

706
01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.765
It's all right! We're clear!

707
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:45.268
Ripley, you've blown
the transaxle!

708
01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:47.270
You're just grinding metal!

709
01:07:47.354 --> 01:07:49.564
Come on, ease down.

710
01:07:49.648 --> 01:07:51.691
Ease down.

711
01:07:51.775 --> 01:07:55.528
Ease down. Ease down. Ease down.

712
01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.459
You okay?

713
01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:12.879
- I'm all right.
- Hudson.

714
01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:15.006
Get away from me, man!

715
01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:19.135
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

716
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.472
I don't know.
Maybe a concussion.

717
01:08:22.556 --> 01:08:24.849
- But he's alive.
- He's dead!

718
01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.018
Wake up, pendejo, and then
I'm gonna kill you!

719
01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:30.313
Back off. Right now.

720
01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.943
- Fuck!
- Somebody get me a first aid kit.

721
01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:38.154
Hey. Hey, look.

722
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:41.532
The sarge and Dietrich
aren't dead, man.

723
01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:43.618
Their signs are real low,
but they ain't dead.

724
01:08:43.702 --> 01:08:45.954
- Then we go back in there and get them.
- Fuck that!

725
01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.456
- We don't leave our people behind-
- I ain't going back in there.

726
01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:51.000
You can't help them!

727
01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:55.755
You can't. Right now they're being
cocooned just like the others.

728
01:09:00.052 --> 01:09:04.305
- Dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happenin', man.
- Damn it.

729
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.475
This can't be happenin', man.
This isn't happenin'!

730
01:09:07.559 --> 01:09:11.104
All right. We got
seven canisters of CN-20.

731
01:09:11.188 --> 01:09:14.524
I say we roll them in there and
nerve gas the whole fucking nest.

732
01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:17.402
That's worth a try, but we don't
even know if it's gonna affect them.

733
01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:21.948
Let's just bug out and call it even. Okay?
What are we talking about this for?

734
01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:25.743
I say we take off and nuke
the entire site from orbit.

735
01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.540
It's the only way to be sure.

736
01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:33.876
- Fuckin' "A"!
- Hold on. Hold on one second.

737
01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:38.131
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

738
01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:40.717
They can bill me.

739
01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:45.847
Okay, look. This is an emotional
moment for all of us, okay?

740
01:09:45.931 --> 01:09:49.350
I know that. But let's not
make snap judgments, please.

741
01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.395
This is clearly- clearly an
important species we're dealing with,

742
01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.231
and I don't think that you or
I or anybody has the right...

743
01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:58.401
- to arbitrarily exterminate them.
- Wrong.

744
01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:00.028
Yeah. Watch us.

745
01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:02.405
Maybe you haven't been
keeping up on current events,

746
01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:05.158
but we just got
our asses kicked, pal!

747
01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:08.578
Look. I'm not blind
to what's going on,

748
01:10:08.662 --> 01:10:11.247
but I cannot authorize
that kind of action.

749
01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:13.416
I'm sorry.

750
01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:17.462
Well, I believe
Corporal Hicks...

751
01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:19.505
has authority here.

752
01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:22.925
Corporal Hicks is-

753
01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:25.386
This operation is under
military jurisdiction,

754
01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.388
and Hicks is next
in chain of command.

755
01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.640
Am I right, Corporal?

756
01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.684
Yeah.

757
01:10:32.853 --> 01:10:35.355
Yeah, that's right.

758
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.523
- Yeah. Look, Ripley.
- Yes.

759
01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:40.068
This is a multimillion-dollar
installation, okay?

760
01:10:40.152 --> 01:10:42.070
He can't make
that kind of decision.

761
01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:44.739
He's just a grunt. No offense.

762
01:10:44.823 --> 01:10:48.576
- None taken.
- Ferro, do you copy? Standing by.

763
01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:51.329
Prep for dust off.
We're gonna need immediate evac.

764
01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.331
Roger. On our way.

765
01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:58.044
I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

766
01:11:00.672 --> 01:11:02.423
Let's do it.

767
01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:13.059
Let's go. Pick it up, Hudson.
Pick it up, baby.

768
01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:20.441
All right. Set him down here.

769
01:11:27.032 --> 01:11:29.075
Move it, Spunkmeyer.
We're rolling.

770
01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:36.165
Hold on a second.
There's something-

771
01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.543
Just get up here.

772
01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:41.129
I'm in. Ramp closing.

773
01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:02.817
Spunkmeyer.

774
01:12:04.027 --> 01:12:07.697
Goddamn it.

775
01:12:07.781 --> 01:12:10.116
Well, where the fuck-

776
01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.797
Run!

777
01:13:05.672 --> 01:13:09.467
Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.

778
01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:12.011
Now what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

779
01:13:12.095 --> 01:13:14.388
We're in some
real pretty shit now, man!

780
01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:16.849
Are you finished?

781
01:13:19.686 --> 01:13:21.646
You all right?

782
01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:31.072
I guess we're not gonna
be leaving now, right?

783
01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:32.740
I'm sorry, Newt.

784
01:13:32.866 --> 01:13:35.666
You don't have to be sorry.
It wasn't your fault.

785
01:13:35.692 --> 01:13:36.811
That's it, man.

786
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:39.247
Game over, man! Game over!

787
01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:41.958
What the duck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?

788
01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:46.462
Maybe we could build a fire.
Sing a couple of songs? Why don't we try that?

789
01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:49.298
We'd better get back
'cause it'll be dark soon,

790
01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:52.760
and they mostly
come at night, mostly.

791
01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:13.614
That's everything, right? All right.
This is absolutely everything...

792
01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.701
that we could salvage
out of the A.P.C. wreckage.

793
01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:20.329
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

794
01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:22.582
That ain't so good.

795
01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:26.335
We got,
15 of these M-40 grenades.

796
01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.379
Don't touch that.

797
01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:30.965
- Dangerous, honey.
- Is that the only flamethrower?

798
01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:35.094
Yeah. It's only half full,
but it's functional.

799
01:14:35.178 --> 01:14:38.931
Got another one, it's damaged-
I don't know about that one.

800
01:14:39.683 --> 01:14:44.103
How long after we're declared
overdue can we expect a rescue?

801
01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.274
Seventeen days.

802
01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:51.819
Seventeen days?

803
01:14:51.903 --> 01:14:55.781
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your
parade, but we're not gonna last 17 hours.

804
01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:59.493
Those things are gonna come in here like
they did before. They're gonna come in here-

805
01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:00.691
Hudson! Hudson!

806
01:15:00.717 --> 01:15:02.730
They're gonna come in here
and they're gonna get us!

807
01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:04.832
This little girl
survived longer than that...

808
01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:07.960
with no weapons and no training.

809
01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:09.962
Right?

810
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.051
Why don't you put her in charge?

811
01:15:15.135 --> 01:15:17.970
You'd better just start dealing with
it, Hudson. Listen to me.

812
01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.222
Hudson, just deal with it
because we need you.

813
01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:22.224
And I'm sick of your bullshit.

814
01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:25.895
Now, I want you to get on a terminal and
call up some kind of floor plan file.

815
01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:28.689
Do you understand?
Construction blueprints. I don't care.

816
01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:31.108
Anything that shows the layout of this place.
Are you listening?

817
01:15:31.234 --> 01:15:34.320
- Yeah.
- I need to see air ducts.

818
01:15:34.404 --> 01:15:37.782
I need to see electrical access
tunnels, subbasements,

819
01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:41.535
every possible way
into this complex.

820
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:46.123
- We don't have much time.
- Okay.

821
01:15:46.249 --> 01:15:48.501
- Okay, I'm on it.
- Hudson!

822
01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:53.297
Just relax.

823
01:15:56.718 --> 01:16:01.722
I'll be in medlab. I'll check
on Gorman, continue my analysis.

824
01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:04.767
Fine. You do that.

825
01:16:10.982 --> 01:16:14.819
So this service tunnel must be
how they're moving back and forth.

826
01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:17.405
That's right.
It moves from the processing station...

827
01:16:17.489 --> 01:16:19.824
right into the sublevel here.

828
01:16:21.868 --> 01:16:25.204
Come down on that.
Okay, come over.

829
01:16:25.288 --> 01:16:28.499
Hold. Go back.
Okay, punch that in right there.

830
01:16:34.172 --> 01:16:36.215
- No. It's back here.
- Okay.

831
01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:40.428
Well, there's a pressure
door at this end.

832
01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:44.140
We could close that, weld it shut.
That should hold 'em for a while.

833
01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:46.767
But we gotta figure on them
getting into the complex.

834
01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:51.355
That's right, so we repair the
barricades at these two intersections.

835
01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:54.024
- Right.
- And weld plate steel over these ducts...

836
01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:58.028
here and here and here.

837
01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:01.157
That should seal off
Medlab and Operations.

838
01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:04.744
Outstanding. Now all we need
is a deck of cards.

839
01:17:07.038 --> 01:17:09.123
All right, people.
Let's move like we got a purpose.

840
01:17:09.249 --> 01:17:12.001
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

841
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:17.882
We're sealing the tunnel.
Baby, hurry up. Come on.

842
01:17:30.061 --> 01:17:31.979
For what it's worth.

843
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.233
Here. I want you to put this on.

844
01:17:37.569 --> 01:17:39.820
- What's it for?
- It's a locator.

845
01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:43.407
Then I can find you anywhere
in the complex on this.

846
01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:49.330
- It's just a precaution.
- Thanks.

847
01:17:49.414 --> 01:17:52.208
Doesn't mean we're
engaged or anything.

848
01:17:52.292 --> 01:17:54.251
All right, what's next?

849
01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:13.604
Last stop.

850
01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:19.527
Get in.

851
01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:23.697
Scoot down. That's good.

852
01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:27.827
Now, you lie here and have a nap.
You're very tired.

853
01:18:27.911 --> 01:18:31.288
I don't want to.
I have scary dreams.

854
01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:36.752
Well, I bet Casey doesn't
have scary dreams.

855
01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:38.754
Let's take a look.

856
01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:41.173
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

857
01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:45.553
See? Maybe you could
just try to be like her?

858
01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:48.138
Ripley, she doesn't
have bad dreams...

859
01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:51.267
because she's just
a piece of plastic.

860
01:18:51.351 --> 01:18:54.854
Right. I'm sorry, Newt.

861
01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.821
There.

862
01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:06.782
My mommy always said
there were no monsters-

863
01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:10.202
no real ones- but there are.

864
01:19:11.496 --> 01:19:13.497
Yes, there are, aren't there?

865
01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.918
Why do they tell
little kids that?

866
01:19:19.796 --> 01:19:21.714
Most of the time it's true.

867
01:19:25.218 --> 01:19:26.135
Here.

868
01:19:27.512 --> 01:19:29.346
Take this.

869
01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:32.808
For luck.

870
01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.980
There's that.

871
01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:42.067
Don't go, please.

872
01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:45.696
Newt, I'm gonna be
right in the next room.

873
01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.698
And you see that camera
right up there?

874
01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:50.576
I can see you
right through that camera,

875
01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.995
all the time
to see if you're safe.

876
01:19:57.375 --> 01:20:00.044
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

877
01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:04.048
I mean that. That's a promise.

878
01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:06.800
You promise?

879
01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:09.178
I cross my heart.

880
01:20:09.262 --> 01:20:13.557
- And hope to die?
- And hope to die.

881
01:20:28.448 --> 01:20:32.910
Now go to sleep,
and don't dream.

882
01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.041
Sneak.

883
01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:52.096
The molecular acid oxidizes after the
creature's death, completely neutralizing it.

884
01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:55.599
Bishop, you know, that's very interesting,
but it doesn't really get us anywhere, does it?

885
01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.227
I'm trying to figure out
what we're dealing with here.

886
01:20:58.311 --> 01:21:00.396
Let's go through it again.

887
01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.690
They grab the colonists,
they move them over there...

888
01:21:02.774 --> 01:21:07.111
and they immobilize them
to be hosts for more of these.

889
01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:11.031
Which would mean that there would have
to be a lot of these parasites, right?

890
01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.283
One for each colonist.
That's over 100, at least.

891
01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:15.285
Yes. That follows.

892
01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:19.415
But each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

893
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.877
So who's laying these eggs?

894
01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:27.047
I'm not sure.

895
01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:29.299
It must be something
we haven't seen yet.

896
01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:37.099
Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed
as soon as you're finished with them.

897
01:21:37.183 --> 01:21:40.477
- Is that clear?
- Mr. Burke gave instructions...

898
01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:44.022
that they were to be kept alive in
stasis for return to the company labs.

899
01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:48.152
He was very specific about it.

900
01:21:49.529 --> 01:21:53.532
Look. Those two specimens are worth
millions to the bio-weapons division, right?

901
01:21:53.616 --> 01:21:56.994
Now, if you're smart,
we can both come out of this heroes,

902
01:21:57.078 --> 01:22:00.289
and we will be set up for life.

903
01:22:01.332 --> 01:22:03.917
You're crazy, Burke.
Do you know that?

904
01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:08.172
Do you really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past I.C.C. quarantine?

905
01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:11.133
How can they impound it if
they don't know about it?

906
01:22:11.217 --> 01:22:14.261
But they will know about it,
Burke, from me.

907
01:22:14.345 --> 01:22:18.557
Just like they'll know that you were
responsible for the deaths of 157 colonists.

908
01:22:18.683 --> 01:22:21.101
- Wait a second.
- You sent them to that ship.

909
01:22:21.227 --> 01:22:23.312
- You're wrong.
- I just checked the colony log.

910
01:22:23.396 --> 01:22:27.274
Directive dated 6-12-79,
signed Burke, Carter J.

911
01:22:27.358 --> 01:22:30.277
You sent them out there,
and you didn't even warn them.

912
01:22:30.403 --> 01:22:32.821
- Why didn't you warn them, Burke?
- Okay, look.

913
01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:35.407
What if that ship didn't even exist?
Do you ever think about that?

914
01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:39.161
I didn't know. So now if I went and made
a major security situation out of it,

915
01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:42.664
everybody steps in, administration steps in,
and there's no exclusive rights for anybody.

916
01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:46.794
Nobody wins. So I made a
decision, and it was wrong.

917
01:22:46.878 --> 01:22:49.588
It was a bad call, Ripley.
It was a bad call.

918
01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:51.381
- Bad call?
- Right.

919
01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:53.091
These people are dead, Burke!

920
01:22:53.176 --> 01:22:55.594
Don't you have any idea
what you've done here?

921
01:22:55.678 --> 01:22:58.597
I'm gonna make sure that they nail
you right to the wall for this!

922
01:22:58.681 --> 01:23:00.933
You're not gonna sleaze
your way out of this one.

923
01:23:01.017 --> 01:23:03.185
Right to the wall.

924
01:23:05.021 --> 01:23:08.176
Ripley. I-

925
01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:10.261
You know, I expected
more from you.

926
01:23:10.346 --> 01:23:13.264
I thought you'd be
smarter than this.

927
01:23:13.349 --> 01:23:16.768
Well, I'm happy
to disappoint you.

928
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:26.583
It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?

929
01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:30.212
That's it. Emergency venting.

930
01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:34.925
That's beautiful, man.
Man, that- that just beats it all.

931
01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:37.886
- How long till it blows?
- Four hours.

932
01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:41.056
With a blast radius
of 30 kilometers,

933
01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.768
equal to about 40 megatons.

934
01:23:44.894 --> 01:23:45.859
We got problems.

935
01:23:45.885 --> 01:23:48.380
I don't believe this.
I don't fucking believe this.

936
01:23:48.439 --> 01:23:50.941
Vasquez, close the shutters.

937
01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:53.193
Why can't we shut it
down from here?

938
01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:55.195
I'm sorry.
The crash caused too much damage.

939
01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.823
An overload is inevitable
at this point.

940
01:23:57.907 --> 01:24:00.826
Man, and I was getting short.

941
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:04.246
Four more weeks and out.
Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.

942
01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.415
- It ain't half fair, man.
- Hudson, give us a break!

943
01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:09.084
Four more weeks. Man.

944
01:24:09.168 --> 01:24:12.379
We've got to get the other
drop ship from the sulaco.

945
01:24:12.463 --> 01:24:15.424
I mean, there must be some way
of bringing it down on remote.

946
01:24:15.508 --> 01:24:19.011
How? The transmitter was on the A.P.C.
It's wasted.

947
01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:22.347
I don't care how, but we'd better think
of something. We'd better think of a way.

948
01:24:22.473 --> 01:24:25.309
- Think of what? We're fucked! We're doomed!
- Shut up!

949
01:24:25.393 --> 01:24:28.186
Shut up! What about
the colony transmitters?

950
01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:31.064
The uplink tower down at the other end.
Why can't we use that?

951
01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:34.109
No, I checked. The hardware in
between here and there was damaged.

952
01:24:34.193 --> 01:24:36.111
We can't align the dish.

953
01:24:36.195 --> 01:24:38.614
Well, somebody's gonna
have to go out there,

954
01:24:38.698 --> 01:24:41.617
take a portable terminal,
go out there and patch in manually.

955
01:24:41.701 --> 01:24:46.747
Yeah, sure. With those things running around?
You can count me out.

956
01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:48.874
- Guess we can just count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

957
01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:50.751
That's right, man.
Why don't you go, man?

958
01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:52.711
- I'll go.
- What?

959
01:24:52.795 --> 01:24:57.132
I'll go. I mean, I'm the only one
qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway.

960
01:24:57.216 --> 01:25:01.595
Yeah, right, man.
Bishop should go. Good idea.

961
01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:03.847
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.

962
01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.850
I may be synthetic,
but I'm not stupid.

963
01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:20.530
How long?

964
01:25:20.615 --> 01:25:23.867
This conduit runs almost to the
uplink assembly- 180 meters.

965
01:25:23.993 --> 01:25:27.287
- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there-
- Right.

966
01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:31.124
An hour to patch in
and align the antenna.

967
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.461
Thirty minutes to prep the ship,

968
01:25:34.587 --> 01:25:37.798
- and about 50 minutes flight time.
- It's gonna be close.

969
01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:45.013
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

970
01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:50.268
Watch your fingers.

971
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:52.646
Vaya con Dios, man.

972
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:10.288
I want you two
walking perimeter.

973
01:26:10.373 --> 01:26:12.582
Hey, listen.

974
01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:15.585
We're all in strung-out shape,

975
01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:18.964
but stay frosty and alert.

976
01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:23.260
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

977
01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:25.470
All right. Vámonos.

978
01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:38.358
How long's it been
since you got any sleep?

979
01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:42.070
Twenty-four hours?

980
01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:45.449
Hicks, I'm not gonna end
up like those others.

981
01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:48.368
You'll take care
of it, won't you?

982
01:26:49.954 --> 01:26:54.499
if it comes to that,
I'll do us both.

983
01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.920
Listen, let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that.

984
01:26:59.046 --> 01:27:02.632
- All right?
- All right.

985
01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:07.929
Hey, I want to introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

986
01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:11.933
This is an M-41A
pulse rifle, 10 millimeter,

987
01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:15.854
with an over-and-under 30 millimeter
pump-action grenade launcher.

988
01:27:15.938 --> 01:27:17.898
Feel the weight.

989
01:27:24.822 --> 01:27:27.115
Okay, what do I do?

990
01:27:32.538 --> 01:27:35.165
- Okay, pull it in tight here.
- Right.

991
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:37.584
Lean into it.

992
01:27:37.668 --> 01:27:40.337
All right.
Now, it will kick some.

993
01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:43.965
All right. When the counter
reads zero here, you-

994
01:27:44.091 --> 01:27:46.343
- I press this up?
- That's right.

995
01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:51.556
Get another one in quick.
Slap it in hard.

996
01:27:51.682 --> 01:27:54.684
- Right.
- And you're ready to rock and roll.

997
01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:57.604
- What's this?
- That's the grenade launcher.

998
01:27:57.688 --> 01:28:00.440
I don't think you
want to mess with that.

999
01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:04.528
You started this.
Show me everything.

1000
01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.571
I can handle myself.

1001
01:28:08.157 --> 01:28:10.116
Yeah, I noticed.

1002
01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:22.212
How do you feel?

1003
01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:25.799
All right, I guess.
One hell of a hangover.

1004
01:28:27.343 --> 01:28:29.553
- Look, Ripley, I just want-
- Forget it.

1005
01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.596
Excuse me.

1006
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:31.364
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay. It's okay.

1007
01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:45.522
Newt, wake up.

1008
01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:47.524
- Wha-
- Be quiet.

1009
01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:49.609
We're in trouble.

1010
01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.920
No!

1011
01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:11.673
Move, Newt!

1012
01:31:32.153 --> 01:31:34.070
Hey!

1013
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.417
Help! Help!

1014
01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:49.461
- Hicks!
- Somebody!

1015
01:31:49.545 --> 01:31:51.463
Say again, Bishop.

1016
01:31:51.547 --> 01:31:54.883
You've got it into auto-refuel
mode, and it's sequencing right?

1017
01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:58.011
- That's right.
Okay, good. Stay on it.

1018
01:31:58.137 --> 01:32:01.681
Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.

1019
01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:05.018
- Roger.
- He's at the uplink tower.

1020
01:32:05.144 --> 01:32:07.645
- Good.
- Terrific.

1021
01:32:09.356 --> 01:32:12.358
- Hicks! Hicks! Hicks!
- Help!

1022
01:32:12.443 --> 01:32:15.028
- Help! Help!
- Hicks, help us!

1023
01:32:15.112 --> 01:32:19.199
- Break the glass! Break it. Break it.
- Yes.

1024
01:32:19.283 --> 01:32:21.284
I'll try.

1025
01:32:41.555 --> 01:32:44.015
Ripley, I'm scared.

1026
01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:46.101
Me too.

1027
01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:53.566
Stay here.

1028
01:33:05.371 --> 01:33:08.414
It's the medlab. Hudson!

1029
01:33:08.499 --> 01:33:11.835
Vasquez, meet me in medlab.
We got a fire.

1030
01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:13.920
We're on our way.

1031
01:33:16.799 --> 01:33:18.800
They're coming, Newt.

1032
01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:53.459
Shoot it out!

1033
01:33:57.464 --> 01:33:59.340
- Hudson!
- Jesus.

1034
01:34:02.928 --> 01:34:05.263
Christ, kid, look out!

1035
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:14.189
Fucking die.

1036
01:34:26.076 --> 01:34:29.287
- Over there! Ready?
- Yeah! Yeah!

1037
01:34:29.371 --> 01:34:30.997
Now!

1038
01:34:34.501 --> 01:34:36.377
- Hudson?
- Yeah. All clear.

1039
01:34:36.503 --> 01:34:39.047
Nailed the other one.
It's history, man.

1040
01:34:40.466 --> 01:34:42.383
Jesus.

1041
01:34:43.552 --> 01:34:47.138
Burke- It was Burke.

1042
01:34:49.391 --> 01:34:52.602
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.

1043
01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:55.605
Just doesn't make
any goddamn sense.

1044
01:34:58.567 --> 01:35:02.612
He figured that he could get an
alien back through quarantine...

1045
01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:05.406
if one of us was impregnated-

1046
01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:08.910
whatever you call it-

1047
01:35:08.994 --> 01:35:11.579
and then frozen
for the trip home.

1048
01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:15.708
Nobody would know about the
embryos we were carrying-

1049
01:35:15.793 --> 01:35:17.835
me and Newt.

1050
01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:21.631
Wait a minute, now.
We'd all know.

1051
01:35:21.715 --> 01:35:23.967
Yes. The only way
he could do it...

1052
01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:27.804
is if he sabotaged certain
freezers on the way home.

1053
01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:30.473
Namely yours.

1054
01:35:30.557 --> 01:35:34.435
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

1055
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.899
Fuck! He's dead.
You're dog meat, pal.

1056
01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:42.819
This is so nuts.

1057
01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:45.530
I mean, listen-
Listen to what you're saying.

1058
01:35:45.614 --> 01:35:48.283
It's paranoid delusion.

1059
01:35:48.367 --> 01:35:52.704
It's really sad. It's pathetic.

1060
01:35:52.788 --> 01:35:56.582
You know, Burke, I don't know
which species is worse.

1061
01:35:56.667 --> 01:35:59.961
You don't see them fucking each
other over for a goddamn percentage.

1062
01:36:00.045 --> 01:36:03.172
All right.
We waste him. No offense.

1063
01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:04.924
No! He's gotta go back-

1064
01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:09.721
- They cut the power.
- What do you mean, they cut the power?

1065
01:36:09.805 --> 01:36:11.389
How could they cut the power, man?
They're animals.

1066
01:36:11.473 --> 01:36:14.058
I want you two with trackers,
checking the corridors! Move!

1067
01:36:14.143 --> 01:36:16.060
- Gorman, watch Burke!
- I got him.

1068
01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:18.438
Newt, stay close.

1069
01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:25.028
- I'll go this side.
- You do that, man.

1070
01:36:48.761 --> 01:36:51.554
- Anything?
- There's something.

1071
01:36:51.638 --> 01:36:54.849
It's inside the complex.

1072
01:36:54.933 --> 01:36:56.934
You're just reading me.

1073
01:36:57.895 --> 01:36:59.812
No, no, it ain't you.

1074
01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:05.651
They're inside- inside the perimeter.
They're in here.

1075
01:37:05.736 --> 01:37:09.197
Hudson, stay cool! Vasquez?

1076
01:37:15.954 --> 01:37:17.538
Hudson may be right.

1077
01:37:17.664 --> 01:37:20.792
- Get back, both of you!
- The signal's weird.

1078
01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:24.837
Must be some interference
or something.

1079
01:37:24.922 --> 01:37:26.839
There's movement
all over the place!

1080
01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:30.259
Get back to Operations.
It's game time.

1081
01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:32.720
Newt.

1082
01:37:34.264 --> 01:37:37.141
Seal the door. Hurry!

1083
01:37:37.226 --> 01:37:40.686
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Get back!

1084
01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:42.688
Work fast.

1085
01:37:46.068 --> 01:37:49.237
Cover your eyes, Newt.
Don't look at the light.

1086
01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:52.323
Movement. Signal's clean.

1087
01:37:52.408 --> 01:37:54.325
Range, 20 meters.

1088
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:56.577
They found a way in,
something we missed.

1089
01:37:56.662 --> 01:37:58.579
We didn't miss anything.

1090
01:37:58.664 --> 01:38:02.458
Eighteen. Seventeen meters.

1091
01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.919
Something under the floor, not in the plans.
I don't know.

1092
01:38:05.003 --> 01:38:07.088
- Fifteen meters.
- Ripley!

1093
01:38:07.172 --> 01:38:10.675
- Definitely inside the barricades.
- Let's go.

1094
01:38:12.302 --> 01:38:14.178
- Thirteen meters.
- That's right outside the door.

1095
01:38:14.304 --> 01:38:16.931
- Hicks, Vasquez, get back!
- This is a big fucking signal.

1096
01:38:17.015 --> 01:38:20.226
- How you doing, Vasquez? Talk to me.
- Almost there.

1097
01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:24.230
That's it.

1098
01:38:24.314 --> 01:38:28.609
Twelve meters. Eleven.

1099
01:38:28.694 --> 01:38:31.195
- Ten.
- Then they're right on us.

1100
01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:34.532
- Nine meters.
- Remember-short, controlled bursts.

1101
01:38:34.616 --> 01:38:35.950
Eight meters.

1102
01:38:38.954 --> 01:38:41.622
Seven.

1103
01:38:41.707 --> 01:38:44.625
- Six.
- It can't be. That's inside the room.

1104
01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:47.753
- It's reading right, man. Look!
- Well, you're not reading it right.

1105
01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:54.927
Five meters, man.
Four. What the hell?

1106
01:38:57.598 --> 01:39:01.184
- Oh my God. Oh sh-
- Give me the light.

1107
01:39:19.786 --> 01:39:22.205
There they go!
Over there! Get them!

1108
01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:27.001
Come on! Get them!

1109
01:39:27.085 --> 01:39:30.421
Do something, Gorman!

1110
01:39:30.506 --> 01:39:34.217
Get them! Look out! There's more of them!
There's more of them!

1111
01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:38.429
Medical! Get to Medical!
Do it! Now!

1112
01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:42.600
Hudson, look out! Look out!

1113
01:39:42.684 --> 01:39:46.979
Now!

1114
01:39:49.066 --> 01:39:51.234
Burke!

1115
01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:54.195
Open this door!

1116
01:39:54.279 --> 01:39:57.073
Burke! Open it!

1117
01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:00.868
Go! Fall back!

1118
01:40:04.039 --> 01:40:06.249
Go!

1119
01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:09.168
- Die, motherfucker!
- Burke!

1120
01:40:09.253 --> 01:40:12.838
Hudson! Hudson!

1121
01:40:12.923 --> 01:40:17.927
Motherfucker! Come on! Come on!
Come and get it, baby! Come on!

1122
01:40:18.011 --> 01:40:21.639
I don't got all day! Come on!
Come on! Come on, you bastard!

1123
01:40:21.765 --> 01:40:24.517
- Come on! You too!
- You want some of this?

1124
01:40:24.601 --> 01:40:26.894
Fuck you!

1125
01:40:27.854 --> 01:40:30.606
Fuck you! Hicks!

1126
01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:33.317
Hudson!

1127
01:40:41.451 --> 01:40:43.911
Come on. Let's go!

1128
01:40:44.454 --> 01:40:46.747
It's locked!

1129
01:41:04.016 --> 01:41:07.727
- Got it! Let's go! Let's go!
- Go! Go!

1130
01:41:10.355 --> 01:41:13.232
- Move, Gorman!
- Seal it!

1131
01:41:14.276 --> 01:41:18.571
Burke! Goddamn you!
Open this door!

1132
01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:31.167
Get back!

1133
01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:33.502
- Hurry up.
- Gorman, get out of the way!

1134
01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:36.631
- Ripley, this way!
- What-

1135
01:41:36.715 --> 01:41:38.591
Wait. Get behind me.

1136
01:41:38.675 --> 01:41:42.762
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast!

1137
01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:46.932
- Hicks!
- Go! Come on. Let's go.

1138
01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:50.102
Move!

1139
01:41:57.069 --> 01:42:00.571
- Which way is it to the landing field from here?
- This way.

1140
01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.995
Go right.

1141
01:42:10.248 --> 01:42:12.208
This way. This way.

1142
01:42:20.842 --> 01:42:24.303
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

1143
01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:27.973
Bishop, do you read me?
Come in. Over.

1144
01:42:28.058 --> 01:42:29.934
The ship is on its way.

1145
01:42:30.018 --> 01:42:33.104
E.T.A., 16 minutes.

1146
01:42:33.188 --> 01:42:35.981
- Stand by there. We're on our way.

1147
01:42:47.244 --> 01:42:49.203
- Which way now?
- That way.

1148
01:42:49.287 --> 01:42:52.331
- No, wait. This way.
- You sure?

1149
01:42:53.917 --> 01:42:56.794
Vasquez, move!

1150
01:42:59.381 --> 01:43:01.549
- Right up here. It's just up here.
- Hicks!

1151
01:43:01.633 --> 01:43:04.510
We're almost there.

1152
01:43:04.594 --> 01:43:07.847
Newt, wait! Newt!

1153
01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:33.831
Vasquez!

1154
01:43:33.915 --> 01:43:36.208
Go!

1155
01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:40.880
No!

1156
01:43:52.142 --> 01:43:54.477
Newt.

1157
01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:57.897
Up there. There's a shortcut
across the rood.

1158
01:43:57.981 --> 01:44:00.065
Hicks.

1159
01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:11.619
You always were
an asshole, Gorman.

1160
01:44:30.013 --> 01:44:32.223
Newt! God! Ripley!

1161
01:44:32.307 --> 01:44:34.558
Newt!

1162
01:44:34.643 --> 01:44:37.770
Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!

1163
01:44:42.234 --> 01:44:44.693
- Hold on, Newt!
- I'm slipping!

1164
01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:46.987
- Don't let go.
- Ripley!

1165
01:44:47.072 --> 01:44:50.115
- Hold on. Gotcha!
- Help!

1166
01:44:51.117 --> 01:44:53.577
I gotcha.

1167
01:44:53.662 --> 01:44:56.539
Newt!

1168
01:44:56.665 --> 01:44:58.499
No!

1169
01:45:01.878 --> 01:45:04.713
Come on.
We can find her with this.

1170
01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:08.509
- Stay where you are, Newt.
- Ripley!

1171
01:45:08.593 --> 01:45:11.679
We're coming.

1172
01:45:20.897 --> 01:45:22.898
Ripley!

1173
01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.071
This way.

1174
01:45:30.657 --> 01:45:33.993
- She's close.
- Newt!

1175
01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:38.581
Ripley!

1176
01:45:38.665 --> 01:45:41.125
Where are you? Can you hear me?

1177
01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:44.420
- Newt!
- Here!

1178
01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:46.714
- I'm here!
- Where?

1179
01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:53.804
Newt, are you okay?

1180
01:45:53.889 --> 01:45:56.682
We'll have to cut it.

1181
01:45:56.766 --> 01:46:00.185
Climb down, honey.
We've gotta cut through.

1182
01:46:07.402 --> 01:46:09.320
Newt?

1183
01:46:09.404 --> 01:46:12.698
Now, don't move.
Stay very still.

1184
01:46:12.782 --> 01:46:14.783
Okay.

1185
01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:17.536
We're almost there.
Hang in there, okay?

1186
01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:26.462
- Hicks. Hurry.
- I know.

1187
01:46:26.588 --> 01:46:29.048
- I know!
- I mean it!

1188
01:46:42.687 --> 01:46:45.606
Newt? Newt, just stay still.

1189
01:46:48.818 --> 01:46:51.028
Almost there.

1190
01:46:51.112 --> 01:46:52.780
No!

1191
01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.325
Newt!

1192
01:47:06.127 --> 01:47:09.630
No! No!

1193
01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:11.882
- No! No! No!
- Let's go.

1194
01:47:11.967 --> 01:47:14.176
No! No! They don't kill you!

1195
01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:16.387
They-They don't kill you! They-

1196
01:47:16.471 --> 01:47:18.347
She's alive! She's alive!

1197
01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:20.849
All right. I believe you.
She's alive.

1198
01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:23.602
We've got to go. Now!

1199
01:47:38.493 --> 01:47:40.452
Go!

1200
01:47:54.009 --> 01:47:58.512
- Get it off!
- Hicks.

1201
01:47:58.596 --> 01:48:00.889
Get it off!

1202
01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:10.983
Here.

1203
01:48:15.238 --> 01:48:17.322
Go.

1204
01:48:19.701 --> 01:48:21.910
Come on. You can make it.

1205
01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:48.437
Bishop, how much time?

1206
01:48:48.521 --> 01:48:50.314
Plenty. Twenty-six minutes.

1207
01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:53.817
- We're not leaving.
- We're not?

1208
01:50:18.194 --> 01:50:22.573
- Ripley— I don't wanna hear about it, Bishop.
She's alive. There's still time.

1209
01:50:22.657 --> 01:50:25.742
In 19 minutes, this area is gonna be
a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.

1210
01:50:25.869 --> 01:50:28.662
- Hicks, don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

1211
01:50:31.916 --> 01:50:35.002
Attention. Emergency.

1212
01:50:35.086 --> 01:50:39.131
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1213
01:50:39.215 --> 01:50:42.050
You now have 15 minutes...

1214
01:50:42.135 --> 01:50:44.386
to reach minimum safe distance.

1215
01:51:30.725 --> 01:51:34.186
Attention. Emergency.

1216
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:38.482
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1217
01:51:38.566 --> 01:51:41.318
You now have 14 minutes...

1218
01:51:41.402 --> 01:51:44.071
to reach minimum safe distance.

1219
01:55:24.542 --> 01:55:28.211
- Ripley! Ripley!
- Newt.

1220
01:55:42.143 --> 01:55:46.396
Grab on to me! Hold on!

1221
01:59:37.378 --> 01:59:39.379
Let's go!

1222
01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:44.801
Behind us!

1223
02:00:35.603 --> 02:00:38.438
Attention. Emergency.

1224
02:00:38.522 --> 02:00:41.691
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1225
02:00:43.319 --> 02:00:46.446
Attention. Emergency.

1226
02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:51.034
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1227
02:00:51.118 --> 02:00:53.578
You now have four minutes...

1228
02:00:53.662 --> 02:00:56.122
to reach minimum safe distance.

1229
02:01:12.097 --> 02:01:15.892
Come on, goddamn it!

1230
02:01:18.854 --> 02:01:21.648
Hold on to me!

1231
02:02:10.906 --> 02:02:13.700
Attention. Emergency.

1232
02:02:13.784 --> 02:02:17.704
All personnel
must evacuate immediately.

1233
02:02:17.788 --> 02:02:20.456
You now have two minutes...

1234
02:02:20.541 --> 02:02:24.544
to reach minimum safe distance.

1235
02:02:30.259 --> 02:02:32.260
No.

1236
02:02:35.556 --> 02:02:38.433
Bishop, goddamn you!

1237
02:03:42.247 --> 02:03:44.332
Close your eyes, baby.

1238
02:03:46.877 --> 02:03:48.878
Look!

1239
02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:57.762
Come on! Come on!

1240
02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:28.835
Punch it, Bishop!

1241
02:05:14.047 --> 02:05:16.132
It's okay. We're okay.

1242
02:05:25.851 --> 02:05:27.810
Hey.

1243
02:05:29.229 --> 02:05:31.731
We made it.

1244
02:05:31.815 --> 02:05:33.816
I knew you'd come.

1245
02:05:48.749 --> 02:05:50.917
He's gonna be all right.
He's just out.

1246
02:05:51.001 --> 02:05:53.377
I had to give him another shot
for the pain.

1247
02:05:54.588 --> 02:05:57.173
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to Medical.

1248
02:05:57.257 --> 02:05:59.258
Okay.

1249
02:06:04.932 --> 02:06:08.935
I'm sorry if I scared you.
That platform was just becoming too unstable.

1250
02:06:09.019 --> 02:06:11.813
I had to circle and hope that things
didn't get too rough to take you off.

1251
02:06:11.897 --> 02:06:15.858
Bishop, you did okay.

1252
02:06:15.943 --> 02:06:18.653
- I did?
- Yeah.

1253
02:06:58.110 --> 02:07:00.319
Go! Move!

1254
02:07:02.739 --> 02:07:05.908
No! Here! Here!

1255
02:07:05.993 --> 02:07:07.994
Run!

1256
02:07:13.292 --> 02:07:14.876
Here!

1257
02:08:43.632 --> 02:08:45.841
Get away from her, you bitch!

1258
02:09:06.989 --> 02:09:11.534
Come on! Come on!

1259
02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:42.458
Ripley!

1260
02:11:53.864 --> 02:11:56.323
Bishop!

1261
02:12:42.871 --> 02:12:45.831
- Mommy.
- God!

1262
02:12:48.752 --> 02:12:51.921
Not bad for a h-human.

1263
02:13:39.052 --> 02:13:42.012
Are we gonna sleep
all the way home?

1264
02:13:42.138 --> 02:13:45.140
- All the way home.
- Can I dream?

1265
02:13:47.435 --> 02:13:50.062
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

1266
02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:01.448
- Sleep tight.
- Affirmative.
