1
00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.726
"Save the planet."

2
00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:39.202
Whenever I've read that bumper sticker,
I've had to laugh.

3
00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.742
"Save the planet."

4
00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.504
What for?

5
00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:47.977
And from what, ourselves?

6
00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:53.250
What about God?
Can he help us?

7
00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.149
I don't think so.

8
00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:58.917
God gave us what we have
to see how we'll use it.

9
00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.993
Shit. Rats in a cage
would've done it better.

10
00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.725
"Life's a bitch
and then you die."

11
00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:09.096
Bumper-sticker philosophy.

12
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.838
Yeah, right.

13
00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.737
Sometimes...

14
00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.770
you get a second chance.

15
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.941
For hundreds of thousands of people
commuting to the Iranian capital...

16
00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.069
this morning began
just like any other.

17
00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.342
At least 52 people died,
along with four bombers...

18
00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.349
and 700 were injured.

19
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.579
If the chief U.S. interest at this point
is in combating terrorism...

20
00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.781
as it emanates
from Kazakhstan...

21
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.155
there really isn't anyone
to deal with other than-

22
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.854
Since Kazakhstan's
independence six years ago-

23
00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.311
Get out here!

24
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.787
Come here!

25
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.688
Get back!

26
00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:24.763
You remember me?

27
00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.922
You sold me a gun
that don't work.

28
00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:30.593
It almost got me killed. I paid $20
for this. I want my money back.

29
00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.068
Give me that.

30
00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.804
Okay.

31
00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:29.856
I owe you.

32
00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:33.489
I'll save you some.

33
00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:52.109
Hey, Toorop. Toorop.
Somebody came by looking for you.

34
00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:55.353
Okay.

35
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.266
If the chief U.S. interest
at this point is in combating terrorism...

36
00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:44.392
that emanates from Kazakhstan-

37
00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:46.266
Boy, what a massacre.

38
00:06:50.642 --> 00:06:53.008
The victims were killed
as they were visiting the factory...

39
00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:55.046
in a northeastern
Kazakhstan province.

40
00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:57.741
The blast went off as the-

41
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.351
At the peak
of the rush hour, bombs were detonated...

42
00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:06.686
in three crowded trains
and aboard a bus.

43
00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.760
At least 50-

44
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.484
Toorop.

45
00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:49.425
Karl, is that you?

46
00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:52.265
I thought you were in Sudan,
killing babies.

47
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.896
Remember the last time we met?

48
00:07:55.007 --> 00:07:59.171
I told you if you ever point
that gun at me again...

49
00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.575
I'd kill you.

50
00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:06.339
Who would hire
a baby killer to get me-

51
00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.447
Who?

52
00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:16.517
No shit, Karl.

53
00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:19.756
If you wanted me dead, you would've
blown up the building. Who?

54
00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:22.197
Gorsky.

55
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.871
Karl, you're a disgrace
to the profession.

56
00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:31.499
You're not a mercenary.
You're a fucking terrorist.

57
00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:36.842
You need two things to live
in this business: your balls and your word.

58
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:39.008
You don't have either.

59
00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:42.516
Know the difference
between you and me, Karl?

60
00:08:44.823 --> 00:08:46.848
I still got both.

61
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.857
Take it easy.

62
00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:55.400
That was just personal
between him and me.

63
00:08:56.568 --> 00:08:59.059
Let me get my things.

64
00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:26.329
Amateurs.

65
00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:29.463
Toorop.

66
00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:34.602
- See you, kid.
- Thank you, Toorop.

67
00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:45.638
You are a hard man
to find, Toorop.

68
00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:47.541
I'm not hiding.

69
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.049
You could've knocked.

70
00:10:53.318 --> 00:10:56.378
I needed to be sure
that you were the same idealist...

71
00:10:56.488 --> 00:10:59.082
who worked for me 10 years ago.

72
00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:03.326
So you knew
I was gonna kill Karl.

73
00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:07.392
I don't like you, Gorsky.

74
00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:10.161
You can't trust me,
and I can't trust you.

75
00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:12.463
This is not about trust.

76
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:16.735
This is about, uh,
professionalism...

77
00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:18.400
ethics.

78
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.137
Ethics?

79
00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:23.703
If it's about ethics, I
should kill you right now.

80
00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:27.251
And you think that would make
the world a better place?

81
00:11:27.352 --> 00:11:30.719
Look at you, still in this shit-hole.

82
00:11:30.822 --> 00:11:33.552
Surviving.
Sleeping with your gun.

83
00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:36.991
No friends,
no family, no future.

84
00:11:37.095 --> 00:11:38.653
We are the same.

85
00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.527
You and me.

86
00:11:40.632 --> 00:11:44.625
We're not the same.
What do you want?

87
00:11:44.736 --> 00:11:47.227
I need a smuggler.

88
00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:49.739
I don't do refugees anymore.

89
00:11:49.841 --> 00:11:51.103
Use your own cargo.

90
00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:54.144
- You own the borders anyway.
- Only on this side.

91
00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:57.409
- This is an overseas delivery?
- A girl.

92
00:11:57.516 --> 00:12:00.383
She needs to be
in America in six days.

93
00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:03.147
Why are you playing with me?

94
00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:06.053
You know I can't get back
into that country.

95
00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:09.389
You know that U.N. passports
are impossible to fake.

96
00:12:14.866 --> 00:12:18.267
This is not a fake.

97
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.534
Inject it in your neck
when you pass the official border.

98
00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:24.973
This is your new life.

99
00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.068
Clean credit.

100
00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:29.613
John Doe.

101
00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:37.244
What's the catch?

102
00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:41.319
You have to make a choice.

103
00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:42.893
That's the catch.

104
00:12:47.732 --> 00:12:52.169
I'll do it for half a mil.

105
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.431
I can make you do it for free.

106
00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:58.031
You can't make me do shit, Gorsky.

107
00:12:58.143 --> 00:13:01.442
But you can pay me what I need
so I can get the job done right.

108
00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:06.644
You got yourself a deal.

109
00:13:06.751 --> 00:13:08.912
A car will
pick you up outside...

110
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.580
to take you
to the rendezvous point.

111
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:16.718
Cross me, and you'll have
no place to hide anymore...

112
00:13:16.828 --> 00:13:18.853
Toorop.

113
00:13:20.265 --> 00:13:22.927
That goes both ways...

114
00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:26.197
Gorsky.

115
00:15:21.686 --> 00:15:23.415
Shit.

116
00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:20.635
Good morning.

117
00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:22.764
You must be Toorop.

118
00:17:22.874 --> 00:17:24.842
I am Sister Rebeka.

119
00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:27.468
I just want to bring three simple rules
to your attention...

120
00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.547
before we start our journey.

121
00:17:29.647 --> 00:17:31.046
We?

122
00:17:31.149 --> 00:17:33.174
I'm here to pick up one girl.

123
00:17:33.284 --> 00:17:37.311
Wherever she goes, I go.
That is rule number one.

124
00:17:37.422 --> 00:17:38.821
Rule number two:

125
00:17:38.923 --> 00:17:41.892
the less contact she has
with the outside world, the better.

126
00:17:41.993 --> 00:17:44.689
You're here to protect her
from outside influences.

127
00:17:44.796 --> 00:17:48.527
That includes seeing,
hearing and feeling.

128
00:17:49.768 --> 00:17:51.929
You know, it's a harsh world
out there, Sister.

129
00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:55.096
I know. That is
why we live in here.

130
00:17:57.308 --> 00:17:59.674
Ah, shit, okay.
What's your third rule?

131
00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.678
No foul language.

132
00:18:04.916 --> 00:18:06.884
Do we have an agreement?

133
00:18:12.323 --> 00:18:14.985
You listen to my one and only rule.

134
00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:18.756
Don't fuck with me...

135
00:18:18.863 --> 00:18:22.026
or I'll leave you standing
in the middle of nowhere...

136
00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:25.500
with nothing but your ass to sell
to get back here.

137
00:18:25.603 --> 00:18:27.594
Your perfect world.

138
00:18:28.673 --> 00:18:30.641
Do we have an agreement?

139
00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:33.644
Obviously,
you are not a gentleman.

140
00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.474
Obviously not.

141
00:18:37.615 --> 00:18:41.176
Now that we have an understanding,
pick up the bags.

142
00:18:46.357 --> 00:18:47.984
No.

143
00:18:50.895 --> 00:18:52.385
Shit.

144
00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:19.049
- What's your name?
- My name?

145
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.448
You don't have to talk to him.

146
00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:23.578
You didn't introduce yourself.

147
00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:26.651
My name's Toorop.

148
00:20:27.692 --> 00:20:29.660
Are you taking us to New York?

149
00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:33.253
Yes. Now, please, get into the car.

150
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.268
Are you a killer, Mr. Toorop?

151
00:20:39.337 --> 00:20:42.602
Look, lady, I'm just a delivery boy.

152
00:20:42.707 --> 00:20:45.232
And to me, you're just a package.

153
00:20:45.343 --> 00:20:48.972
I'm not your friend. I'm not your brother.
I'm not your boyfriend.

154
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.039
In six days, I'm gonna deliver you
and never see you again.

155
00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:55.517
Sister Rebeka's right.

156
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.679
We shouldn't even talk.

157
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:59.416
Come on.

158
00:21:04.629 --> 00:21:07.189
Comfy?

159
00:21:16.574 --> 00:21:19.008
You wouldn't have a light, would you?

160
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:23.744
Figures.

161
00:21:47.138 --> 00:21:49.231
Are you okay, baby girl?

162
00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.740
I've never been this far.

163
00:23:03.481 --> 00:23:06.416
Let's hurry up.
The train's gonna leave soon.

164
00:23:08.352 --> 00:23:10.252
Take your bags.

165
00:23:12.156 --> 00:23:14.283
Are you really going
to need all that?

166
00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:17.190
We could never have
enough firepower, Sister.

167
00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.160
In fact-

168
00:23:19.263 --> 00:23:21.663
I've never touched a gun in my life.

169
00:23:21.766 --> 00:23:23.791
Now would be
the perfect moment to start.

170
00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:26.995
No, thank you.
I can defend myself.

171
00:23:27.105 --> 00:23:29.505
Stay close. This is the real world.

172
00:23:29.607 --> 00:23:31.905
There's no mercy for the weak.

173
00:23:32.009 --> 00:23:35.069
Just because we're peaceful,
that doesn't mean we're weak.

174
00:23:35.179 --> 00:23:37.147
It does here.

175
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.888
Take this.

176
00:23:50.995 --> 00:23:53.225
- Hurry.
- Here.

177
00:23:54.432 --> 00:23:57.526
- Change.
- What are you doing?

178
00:24:02.406 --> 00:24:05.000
That's him. We're locked on.

179
00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:07.236
He's a big motherfucker. Look at him.

180
00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:09.040
That won't be a problem.

181
00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:12.783
- And that's Aurora.
- She's cute.

182
00:24:12.884 --> 00:24:15.944
- Put this on.
- Let's stay concentrated, guys.

183
00:24:17.054 --> 00:24:19.045
Come on.

184
00:25:13.377 --> 00:25:15.345
What do we do now?

185
00:25:15.446 --> 00:25:17.812
No need to rush. Let's give it time.

186
00:25:17.915 --> 00:25:20.213
Hang on.

187
00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:22.718
Okay, give me three.

188
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.851
Hey.

189
00:25:32.563 --> 00:25:34.656
Where are you going?

190
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.378
What are you doing?
Come on.

191
00:26:17.341 --> 00:26:19.866
Hey! Hey!

192
00:26:21.245 --> 00:26:23.736
Hey, come here! Hey!

193
00:26:39.897 --> 00:26:42.195
- Hey, something's happening. She's on the run.
- Hey!

194
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.961
Aurora! Toorop!

195
00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:48.096
Aurora!

196
00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:57.313
Don't go. You will die.

197
00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:58.892
- What are you doing?
- She's felt it.

198
00:26:58.916 --> 00:27:00.884
- Don't go that way.
- She's not used to crowds.

199
00:27:00.985 --> 00:27:04.045
- We have to go now. We have no time.
- We have to get away.

200
00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:06.783
What is wrong with you?
Make her walk, or I'll carry her.

201
00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.756
- Stop. Don't touch her.
- Don't go that way.

202
00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:10.554
- We're going now.
- We have to get away.

203
00:27:10.661 --> 00:27:12.390
Don't touch her.

204
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.034
Come on.

205
00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:36.411
We'll go to the train.

206
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.613
We need to catch it.
Come on.

207
00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:11.385
Come on. Move. Move.
Get out of the way. Move!

208
00:28:17.294 --> 00:28:19.888
Hey, guys, can I buy
these three seats off you?

209
00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:23.364
Buy some more goats.

210
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.501
For you.

211
00:29:04.675 --> 00:29:07.439
Those tigers in the cage-

212
00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:09.945
they weren't real, right?

213
00:29:12.716 --> 00:29:16.618
Siberian tigers
went extinct in 2017.

214
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.553
The last one died
in the Moscow Zoo.

215
00:29:21.358 --> 00:29:24.020
What is she,
a walking wildlife encyclopedia?

216
00:29:25.062 --> 00:29:26.529
They were clones?

217
00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:31.233
Second-generation clones,
not real tigers.

218
00:29:31.335 --> 00:29:32.666
Copies of copies.

219
00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.365
But they're living creatures,
made by God.

220
00:29:36.474 --> 00:29:40.376
No. They were organic
machines made by man.

221
00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:43.208
But God made man in his image.

222
00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:47.250
So what man creates
is also God's will.

223
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:49.581
Is this what you
teach her in the convent?

224
00:29:49.687 --> 00:29:53.623
Then God would be pretty
fucked up to make man in his image.

225
00:29:53.724 --> 00:29:57.490
You wanna talk? Tell me what
happened at the marketplace.

226
00:30:00.397 --> 00:30:03.855
If I'm gonna protect you...

227
00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:06.300
I need to know
what's wrong with you.

228
00:30:07.738 --> 00:30:09.672
She was scared.

229
00:30:09.773 --> 00:30:12.401
It's the first time
out of the convent...

230
00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.671
and you put us
in that situation.

231
00:30:22.586 --> 00:30:25.350
First time
out of the convent, huh?

232
00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:29.017
So I'm probably delivering you
to some billionaire playboy...

233
00:30:29.126 --> 00:30:31.924
who purchased you
off the Internet.

234
00:32:20.904 --> 00:32:22.997
Stay close.

235
00:32:24.408 --> 00:32:27.673
- What are we doing here?
- Looking for a friend.

236
00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:44.993
Come on. Come on.

237
00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:12.255
Sit over there.

238
00:33:12.356 --> 00:33:16.986
I'll be right there in a minute.
And, you, don't talk to anybody.

239
00:33:17.094 --> 00:33:18.959
Yo, guys.
They're separating.

240
00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:21.463
Don't do anything stupid. Wait.

241
00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:25.033
- Get up, motherfucker.
- Huh?

242
00:33:25.135 --> 00:33:27.262
Hey! Toorop!

243
00:33:27.371 --> 00:33:30.101
How are you?

244
00:33:30.207 --> 00:33:33.643
- How you doing?
- What you doing in this beautiful part of Russia?

245
00:33:33.744 --> 00:33:35.302
Working.

246
00:33:35.412 --> 00:33:38.108
Working for who?
Hey, hey. Two shots.

247
00:33:38.215 --> 00:33:40.706
- Hold your positions. We're gonna move in.
- Gorsky.

248
00:33:45.322 --> 00:33:48.450
He made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

249
00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:51.289
What can I do for you?

250
00:33:51.395 --> 00:33:54.091
I need three passes
on the boat...

251
00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:56.325
and two snow bikes
on the other side.

252
00:33:56.433 --> 00:33:59.197
- You crossing?
- I'm delivering.

253
00:34:00.337 --> 00:34:01.861
The girl.

254
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.904
Her? Who is she?

255
00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:08.636
I don't know.

256
00:34:08.746 --> 00:34:10.976
- Where you taking her?
- America.

257
00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:14.016
- What America? You're on a terrorist list there.
- Yeah.

258
00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:16.245
You need a passport.
You need an identity.

259
00:34:16.353 --> 00:34:19.413
You're kidding me.
You got a passport?

260
00:34:19.523 --> 00:34:23.015
- Yeah, and I'm not coming back.
- That is a bold move.

261
00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:25.527
I got 50 G's saying
you can help me out.

262
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:27.494
When?

263
00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:29.156
Now.

264
00:34:38.442 --> 00:34:40.410
You don't have to look.

265
00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:49.853
Who is he?

266
00:34:49.953 --> 00:34:51.580
He's a lost soul.

267
00:34:56.126 --> 00:34:58.356
See you at the landing
at 0600 sharp.

268
00:34:58.462 --> 00:35:01.022
You got it.

269
00:35:01.131 --> 00:35:03.292
- Who was that?
- An old friend. A good smuggler.

270
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.801
- You trust him?
- I don't trust anybody. Come on.

271
00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:13.566
Sorry, kids.
These girls are with me.

272
00:35:13.677 --> 00:35:16.737
- Just let her go, Toorop.
- How do you know my name?

273
00:35:16.847 --> 00:35:19.315
- We know a lot of things you don't know.
- Yeah? Like what?

274
00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:21.213
Like you don't know
what you're doing.

275
00:35:21.318 --> 00:35:24.549
- I'm doing my job.
- Fuck your job.

276
00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:27.021
- What?
- One million, tax free.

277
00:35:31.495 --> 00:35:34.123
Take the money
and walk out without a fight.

278
00:35:34.231 --> 00:35:36.825
Make it easy on yourself, Toorop.

279
00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:52.741
Aurora!

280
00:36:55.712 --> 00:36:58.237
Toorop!

281
00:36:58.348 --> 00:36:59.975
No! Toorop!

282
00:37:00.083 --> 00:37:02.017
No!

283
00:37:21.805 --> 00:37:22.703
Hey.

284
00:37:22.806 --> 00:37:25.900
- Aurora!
- Hey, man, let the girl go.

285
00:37:26.009 --> 00:37:27.874
Just let her go.
Let her go.

286
00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:43.154
Hey, man.
Hey. Hey. I don't-

287
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.852
No!

288
00:37:47.397 --> 00:37:50.889
Get over there!
You wanna fight?

289
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:53.162
Okay, man.

290
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.625
Come on!

291
00:38:35.712 --> 00:38:37.907
Come on!

292
00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:10.005
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

293
00:39:10.113 --> 00:39:12.707
Stop it! Stop!

294
00:39:15.385 --> 00:39:16.818
Don't kill him!

295
00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:22.589
He doesn't want to hurt me.

296
00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:31.228
He wanted to protect me!

297
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.031
- Your father sent us.
- My father?

298
00:39:36.139 --> 00:39:39.336
Get away from her.
Get away from her!

299
00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:40.910
It's okay, Aurora.

300
00:39:42.145 --> 00:39:43.510
- I have to know.
- No.

301
00:39:43.613 --> 00:39:44.841
Aurora!

302
00:39:44.948 --> 00:39:46.210
Aurora.

303
00:39:46.316 --> 00:39:48.511
Aurora! Aurora!
Listen to me. Stop!

304
00:39:48.618 --> 00:39:51.246
Toorop! Toorop!

305
00:39:58.528 --> 00:40:01.088
Come on.

306
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:20.748
Let's go. Hurry up.

307
00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:25.983
Move it.

308
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:28.387
Come on!

309
00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:30.221
Go! Go!

310
00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:47.373
Stop!

311
00:40:51.181 --> 00:40:52.614
Let her go!

312
00:40:59.055 --> 00:41:01.250
Next one dies!

313
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.824
Come with us.
They're ready to die for you.

314
00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:08.898
I don't want anybody
to die for me.

315
00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:28.516
What do you think you're doing?

316
00:41:28.618 --> 00:41:30.916
- What's wrong with you?
- You think this is a game?

317
00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:33.221
- Why did you shoot them?
- You trying to get us killed?

318
00:41:33.256 --> 00:41:35.001
- Why didn't you let me go?
- You don't know them!

319
00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:37.357
Well, what are you gonna do,
shoot me in the head?

320
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.928
- Shoot me like an animal?
- Stop it!

321
00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:51.298
I told you I'd take you
to New York, and I will.

322
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.719
This is way too many refugees, man.

323
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.881
The ice is getting
thinner every year.

324
00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:43.516
They're losing cargo
all the time.

325
00:42:46.129 --> 00:42:49.189
We're not gonna all
get on the boat.

326
00:42:49.299 --> 00:42:51.893
Make sure we do.

327
00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:55.597
Ah, this goddamn global warming's
bad for business.

328
00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:11.177
What's happening?

329
00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:12.880
Watch this.

330
00:43:56.232 --> 00:43:57.859
There's not much time.

331
00:43:57.968 --> 00:43:59.902
They don't wanna be
spotted by satellites.

332
00:44:00.003 --> 00:44:02.130
Hurry. Come on!

333
00:44:32.435 --> 00:44:35.029
Come on!

334
00:44:44.614 --> 00:44:46.445
Move!

335
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:47.948
Come on!

336
00:45:21.584 --> 00:45:24.052
No!

337
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:33.855
No!

338
00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:38.492
You can't do this!
They'll die out there!

339
00:45:38.601 --> 00:45:40.159
No!

340
00:45:41.971 --> 00:45:44.496
- You can't do this.
- Get away from the controls.

341
00:45:44.607 --> 00:45:46.905
- What are you doing? Stop it. Stop it.
- No!

342
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.343
- Don't do that. What's wrong?
- Put it down.

343
00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:52.915
- No. Don't.
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

344
00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:56.179
- Take it easy.
- Hey, take it easy.

345
00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.345
We go back up.

346
00:45:58.455 --> 00:46:00.150
Now.

347
00:46:00.256 --> 00:46:01.746
Okay. Okay.

348
00:46:01.858 --> 00:46:03.758
Relax.

349
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.055
- We go back up.
- Easy.

350
00:46:06.162 --> 00:46:07.390
Now.

351
00:46:07.497 --> 00:46:08.930
Relax.

352
00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.329
Calm down.

353
00:46:10.433 --> 00:46:12.128
I feel them!

354
00:46:12.235 --> 00:46:14.294
I feel them!

355
00:46:14.404 --> 00:46:16.804
I feel them dying!

356
00:46:16.906 --> 00:46:19.204
I feel them dying!

357
00:46:21.377 --> 00:46:23.937
The whole Bering Sea is dead!

358
00:46:32.088 --> 00:46:35.990
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What the fuck was that?

359
00:46:44.567 --> 00:46:49.197
I was 17 years old,
living in San Francisco.

360
00:46:49.305 --> 00:46:51.603
My life was a mess.

361
00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:53.903
I met the wrong man.

362
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.638
I was lost in darkness.

363
00:46:56.746 --> 00:46:59.806
But then the high priestess
of our church opened the doors...

364
00:46:59.916 --> 00:47:02.407
that led me
on to the path of light.

365
00:47:04.554 --> 00:47:07.045
I joined the Noelites...

366
00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:09.990
and I ended up in the convent.

367
00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:13.859
It was a haven for women
who needed to heal.

368
00:47:15.298 --> 00:47:17.664
I worked in the orphanage.

369
00:47:19.969 --> 00:47:22.301
She arrived.

370
00:47:22.405 --> 00:47:24.839
A little baby.

371
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:28.202
Her father was dead.

372
00:47:28.311 --> 00:47:30.609
Nobody knew anything
about the mother.

373
00:47:30.713 --> 00:47:33.944
I took her as my own.

374
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:37.042
I fed her. I taught her.

375
00:47:37.153 --> 00:47:39.553
Everything was fine...

376
00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:42.124
until three months ago.

377
00:47:42.225 --> 00:47:44.785
The doctor came.
He gave her a pill.

378
00:47:44.894 --> 00:47:46.794
He was with her
for 10 minutes...

379
00:47:46.896 --> 00:47:49.330
and then she slowly
started to change.

380
00:47:49.432 --> 00:47:53.664
But nothing-nothing as violent
as what you saw today.

381
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:56.500
But something's not making sense.

382
00:47:59.075 --> 00:48:02.977
How could she know how to operate
a 30-year-old Russian sub?

383
00:48:06.449 --> 00:48:10.249
She's always known things
that she never experienced.

384
00:48:10.353 --> 00:48:14.414
Aurora could speak
when she was two years old.

385
00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:18.756
- A lot of kids speak at two-
- Nineteen different languages.

386
00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.868
Who else knows about this?

387
00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.028
Nobody but the doctor.

388
00:48:28.137 --> 00:48:30.935
He told me to keep it a secret
to protect her.

389
00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:35.277
He said...

390
00:48:35.378 --> 00:48:39.178
that we would get
the best medical help in America.

391
00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:43.416
She needs help.

392
00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:51.584
Get her ready.

393
00:49:09.712 --> 00:49:13.910
You know, two years ago,
in Uzbekistan...

394
00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:16.485
I saw this viral bomb go off.

395
00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:18.747
It was, uh-

396
00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:23.255
It was incredible.
Everybody died.

397
00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:30.626
She's carrying, ain't she?

398
00:49:30.733 --> 00:49:32.132
Huh?

399
00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:36.137
All the symptoms fit.
All that weird behavior.

400
00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:39.436
I'm telling you, man,
she is carrying a weapon.

401
00:49:43.913 --> 00:49:46.939
You have any idea
how much money she's worth?

402
00:49:49.118 --> 00:49:51.484
If she's carrying a virus...

403
00:49:55.124 --> 00:49:58.025
I'll kill her myself
and burn the body.

404
00:50:29.992 --> 00:50:32.358
- What happened to them?
- Fighter drones.

405
00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:34.020
Anything that moves
is shot on sight.

406
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:36.090
Now we're in the zone.
It's 10 miles to the D.M.Z.

407
00:50:36.165 --> 00:50:38.725
Then let's make it
10 fast miles. Let's go!

408
00:50:56.919 --> 00:50:58.682
Toorop, they're coming!

409
00:50:58.788 --> 00:51:00.551
Shit. Finn, we're spotted. Hit it!

410
00:51:10.433 --> 00:51:11.593
Break!

411
00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:19.040
Finn, get close to me! Finn, now!

412
00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:21.406
Aurora, jump onto our bike.

413
00:51:25.548 --> 00:51:29.177
I'll draw them off.
You three, hide here.

414
00:51:59.348 --> 00:52:01.248
What are you doing?

415
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:05.218
Toorop cleared our way out.
We're almost at the border.

416
00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:19.561
Toorop, we need you now!

417
00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:25.300
It's gonna shoot us!
Toorop. Toorop!

418
00:52:31.447 --> 00:52:32.447
Stop!

419
00:52:52.535 --> 00:52:54.628
Toorop!

420
00:52:57.406 --> 00:52:58.805
He's not dead!

421
00:53:00.209 --> 00:53:02.109
Ah, shit!

422
00:53:02.211 --> 00:53:04.042
Hey, stay with me.

423
00:53:05.548 --> 00:53:08.847
He's not reacting.
He's bleeding to death.

424
00:53:08.951 --> 00:53:12.216
I need your help. Okay.

425
00:53:14.924 --> 00:53:17.392
We gotta get outta here now.

426
00:53:17.493 --> 00:53:20.360
It's a small piece of metal.
I'm gonna take it out.

427
00:53:20.463 --> 00:53:23.023
- What do you need?
- Just hold him.

428
00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.826
Look, we don't have time for this, okay?

429
00:53:27.937 --> 00:53:29.734
They're gonna send more drones!

430
00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.807
Aurora?

431
00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:35.739
- You got it?
- I got it.

432
00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:37.710
- It's okay.
- Give me a bandage.

433
00:53:37.813 --> 00:53:40.111
We should never have turned back.

434
00:53:41.684 --> 00:53:43.584
He knows the rules.

435
00:53:43.686 --> 00:53:46.382
I'll sew it up later.

436
00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:50.023
Hey!

437
00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.651
Now you and the passport
are mine.

438
00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:55.526
- What are you doing?
- You, I don't need.

439
00:54:08.544 --> 00:54:11.843
Like I said, trust no one.

440
00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:32.293
It's good.
Where did you learn to cook?

441
00:54:32.401 --> 00:54:34.266
Rule number one
in the mercenary handbook.

442
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:36.361
You never had a woman
take care of you?

443
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:41.108
Sorry.

444
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:43.474
No, not in my line of work.

445
00:54:46.281 --> 00:54:47.379
Finished.

446
00:54:47.483 --> 00:54:49.917
She gets pleasure out of this.

447
00:54:50.019 --> 00:54:54.149
- Crybaby.
- Crybaby?

448
00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.627
What is that?

449
00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:04.061
- Painkiller?
- No, thank you.

450
00:55:04.166 --> 00:55:07.294
- Live a little.
- No.

451
00:55:07.403 --> 00:55:09.303
Aurora, stop!

452
00:55:10.406 --> 00:55:13.102
Spit it out.

453
00:55:16.178 --> 00:55:19.306
Yuck!

454
00:55:19.415 --> 00:55:23.681
Girls, we made it
across the border.

455
00:55:23.786 --> 00:55:25.583
Here's to survival.

456
00:55:26.889 --> 00:55:28.982
And thank you
for saving my life.

457
00:55:29.091 --> 00:55:31.423
Maybe now
you can trust somebody.

458
00:55:34.296 --> 00:55:37.788
We protected each other,
like family.

459
00:55:42.438 --> 00:55:44.702
We are all going to die
in New York.

460
00:55:51.914 --> 00:55:53.848
Good night.

461
00:56:04.226 --> 00:56:06.217
She's just scared.

462
00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.597
Yeah, right.

463
00:56:47.603 --> 00:56:49.571
Go back to sleep.

464
00:56:50.973 --> 00:56:53.771
We still have
a long way ahead of us.

465
00:56:53.876 --> 00:56:56.276
What are you doing?

466
00:56:57.947 --> 00:57:01.075
We go through customs tomorrow.

467
00:57:01.183 --> 00:57:03.242
I can't take these.

468
00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:17.325
You know, when Sister Rebeka
first held me as a baby...

469
00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:19.697
it was a night like this.

470
00:57:20.736 --> 00:57:23.227
Aurora-

471
00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.671
that's where I got my name.

472
00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:29.142
- From the chaos.
- It suits you.

473
00:57:31.447 --> 00:57:35.884
You're risking
your life for me. Why?

474
00:57:38.554 --> 00:57:40.454
I've done my time.

475
00:57:41.857 --> 00:57:46.055
All this killing
and pain and... war-

476
00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:47.629
For what?

477
00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:51.165
I'm tired-

478
00:57:52.568 --> 00:57:55.230
tired of it all.

479
00:57:55.337 --> 00:57:57.897
And you're my only chance
out of this hell.

480
00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:59.565
And go where?

481
00:58:01.677 --> 00:58:04.305
27 Cedar Grove.

482
00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:09.345
Near Canada.
It's upstate New York.

483
00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:11.942
My parents had a farm-

484
00:58:13.989 --> 00:58:16.685
more like a cabin
with a lot of land.

485
00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:21.153
It's probably in ruins,
but I might be able to fix it up.

486
00:58:24.867 --> 00:58:26.994
There is no place like home.

487
00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:34.701
But Kansas ain't
what it used to be.

488
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:36.710
The Wizard of Oz.

489
00:58:36.812 --> 00:58:40.270
1939.

490
00:58:40.382 --> 00:58:42.282
That's right.

491
00:58:49.992 --> 00:58:51.892
Toorop?

492
00:58:55.197 --> 00:58:58.428
Are you really going to kill me
and burn my body?

493
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:03.070
I hope I won't have to.

494
00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:38.699
You have reached the
limit of your water credit.

495
00:59:38.807 --> 00:59:41.970
To purchase more credit,
enter your room number now.

496
01:01:09.865 --> 01:01:13.096
Thirty minutes.
The bus leaves in 30 minutes.

497
01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:16.763
Last plane to New York
in two hours.

498
01:01:42.631 --> 01:01:45.031
Your Highness,
they've crossed the Canadian border.

499
01:01:50.305 --> 01:01:52.205
She's coming.

500
01:01:52.307 --> 01:01:54.571
Let's pray.

501
01:02:52.434 --> 01:02:54.732
A miracle in the making.

502
01:02:57.306 --> 01:03:00.867
Trust. Invest in our new faith.

503
01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:14.614
Tomorrow is the dawn of our new age.

504
01:03:48.924 --> 01:03:50.824
Right here, girls.

505
01:04:02.304 --> 01:04:04.636
Welcome, Mr.Johnson.

506
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.265
Your multimedia system
is loading.

507
01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.640
- We wish you a pleasant stay.
- It's okay.

508
01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:12.179
It's safe here.

509
01:04:35.103 --> 01:04:37.003
Here.

510
01:04:50.752 --> 01:04:53.550
Hey, there's no food.

511
01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.715
Guess we're not
gonna be here long.

512
01:05:07.502 --> 01:05:10.596
- What's wrong?
- They are all dead.

513
01:05:14.009 --> 01:05:16.307
Sources report the
destruction in Kyrgyzstan...

514
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:18.436
of a 1,000-year-old convent...

515
01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:22.950
one of the oldest continually functioning
convents in Central Asia.

516
01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:25.781
Now occupied by
an ascetic branch of the Noelites...

517
01:05:25.887 --> 01:05:28.355
the convent was struck
by a missile late last night.

518
01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:30.357
There were no survivors.

519
01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:33.519
Here, an initial reaction
from the Noelites.

520
01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:37.121
It is a tragedy
to think that even defenseless women...

521
01:05:37.232 --> 01:05:39.632
who made the choice
to withdraw from society...

522
01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:41.635
and lead a life of purity...

523
01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.864
should suffer
the attacks of terrorists...

524
01:05:43.972 --> 01:05:48.534
who have absolutely no respect for
the lives of decent, God-fearing people.

525
01:05:50.412 --> 01:05:53.074
We shall mourn our sisters...

526
01:05:53.181 --> 01:05:55.581
and continue their legacy
for world peace...

527
01:05:55.684 --> 01:05:59.711
through obedience,
purification and hope...

528
01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:02.346
for the miracle
we so desperately need.

529
01:06:08.897 --> 01:06:11.832
Congratulations, my friend.

530
01:06:11.933 --> 01:06:15.664
- You made it safe and sound.
- Gorsky.

531
01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.671
Did you destroy that convent?

532
01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:21.231
I'm not a terrorist, Toorop.
I'm a mercenary, like you.

533
01:06:21.343 --> 01:06:24.642
Bullshit.
What the hell is going-

534
01:06:24.746 --> 01:06:26.646
What the hell
is going on over here?

535
01:06:26.748 --> 01:06:29.444
- You didn't leave me a gun.
- You've done yourjob.

536
01:06:29.551 --> 01:06:31.678
A doctor is coming
in a few minutes.

537
01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:33.948
If she's okay,
you're home free...

538
01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:38.117
and the tracking device
in your passport will be deactivated.

539
01:06:38.226 --> 01:06:40.751
Don't make us use it.

540
01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:47.968
Sometimes it's hard to understand...

541
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:53.838
but I believe God has a reason
for everything that happens.

542
01:06:53.942 --> 01:06:56.172
What reason could there be?

543
01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:00.515
They never hurt anybody.

544
01:07:02.818 --> 01:07:04.718
Maybe it was an accident.

545
01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.947
It was not an accident.

546
01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:11.849
It was destroyed right after
we crossed the border.

547
01:07:14.229 --> 01:07:16.720
Would you like to pray with me?

548
01:07:17.866 --> 01:07:20.664
I don't feel
like praying anymore.

549
01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:35.945
Toorop said
I'm just a package to him.

550
01:07:38.987 --> 01:07:41.046
Why did you bring me here?

551
01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:49.330
'Cause I couldn't
take care of you anymore.

552
01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.613
How is she?

553
01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.378
Scared.

554
01:08:10.485 --> 01:08:14.114
Yeah. Well, she should be.

555
01:08:14.222 --> 01:08:16.713
- Who are they?
- To the left...

556
01:08:16.825 --> 01:08:19.794
the Range Rover goons
work for your sect, the Noelites.

557
01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:24.423
To the right,
the bikers work for Gorsky.

558
01:08:30.138 --> 01:08:32.800
They're all here
to make sure I deliver.

559
01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:36.639
And if we don't?

560
01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.473
It's gonna be a free-for-all.

561
01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:46.987
Look, Sister...

562
01:08:47.088 --> 01:08:49.886
we traveled
6,000 miles together.

563
01:08:49.991 --> 01:08:53.051
The truth is this has been
a suicide mission from the beginning.

564
01:08:53.161 --> 01:08:56.562
They won't let either one of us
walk out of here alive.

565
01:08:56.665 --> 01:09:00.101
- That's why they destroyed the convent.
- That's the doctor...

566
01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:02.670
that came to the convent
three months ago.

567
01:09:04.539 --> 01:09:07.235
Okay.

568
01:09:12.547 --> 01:09:14.879
- Good evening, Sister.
- Good evening.

569
01:09:20.088 --> 01:09:22.318
Good evening.

570
01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:25.416
- Where is she?
- In the room.

571
01:10:05.867 --> 01:10:07.767
Good.

572
01:10:17.245 --> 01:10:19.145
You're a bad man.

573
01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:31.816
They're more powerful
than we expected.

574
01:10:34.029 --> 01:10:36.293
Thank you, Aurora.

575
01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.298
Thank you so much.

576
01:10:53.915 --> 01:10:56.076
- How is she?
- She's fine.

577
01:10:56.184 --> 01:10:58.516
- I have to run some more tests.
- More tests?

578
01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.554
- Standard-
- Hey, you just ran your test.

579
01:11:00.655 --> 01:11:02.714
- What's wrong with her?
- Expect a call from-

580
01:11:02.824 --> 01:11:05.657
What is wrong with her?

581
01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.661
Toorop. Toorop.

582
01:11:08.763 --> 01:11:11.288
Let him go.

583
01:11:11.399 --> 01:11:13.299
If you please.

584
01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:17.797
Thank you, Sister.

585
01:11:25.046 --> 01:11:27.071
- Get over here!
- What's wrong with you?

586
01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:29.673
- I want to know everything that you know.
- Don't you think...

587
01:11:29.784 --> 01:11:32.947
that if I knew anything
I would tell you?

588
01:11:33.054 --> 01:11:36.820
No, I don't think. You're a Noelite.
You're like him.

589
01:11:36.925 --> 01:11:40.486
- You swore an oath.
- Not to them. To God.

590
01:11:40.595 --> 01:11:44.395
God has nothing to do with it now!
You understand?

591
01:11:44.499 --> 01:11:46.677
If she's carrying a virus,
she could annihilate half the city...

592
01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:48.430
and I'm not gonna
have it on my conscience!

593
01:11:48.536 --> 01:11:51.972
- How can you believe that?
- I don't know what I believe anymore!

594
01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:05.112
I'm pregnant. Twins.

595
01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:11.659
It's not possible.
I've watched over you all your life.

596
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.751
No one's ever touched you.

597
01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:19.195
And nobody has.

598
01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:25.569
Shit.

599
01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:29.041
Toorop,
they just want my babies.

600
01:12:30.078 --> 01:12:33.275
Yes.

601
01:12:33.381 --> 01:12:35.281
Mr. Toorop?

602
01:12:35.383 --> 01:12:39.410
- This is the Noelite Church C.E.O.
- I know who you are.

603
01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:44.322
- Thank you for doing such a goodjob, Mr. Toorop.
- You're welcome.

604
01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:46.656
Please bring the girl
to the limousine...

605
01:12:46.761 --> 01:12:48.956
and your mission
is accomplished.

606
01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.704
We're on our way out.

607
01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:04.708
All right, guys. Are you ready?

608
01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.628
Keep them in sight, guys.

609
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.569
We can't let her go, Toorop.

610
01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:32.504
Look around.
Do we have a choice?

611
01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:39.109
She's your problem now.

612
01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:08.609
Thank you, Toorop.

613
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.878
We're going in the subway.

614
01:14:24.025 --> 01:14:26.152
What's wrong?

615
01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:29.128
It's a missile
linked to my passport.

616
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:31.824
- How can you stop it?
- Only by death.

617
01:14:34.235 --> 01:14:36.135
Go to the subway!

618
01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:58.950
Toorop.

619
01:15:06.534 --> 01:15:07.660
Aurora!

620
01:17:04.819 --> 01:17:06.411
I need you to live.

621
01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.990
He's back to life.

622
01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.723
Scars are all gone.
Doctor hasn't lost his touch.

623
01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:52.026
Too bad he can't make him pretty.

624
01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:55.762
Where am I?

625
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:58.896
In paradise. We'll take you to your maker.

626
01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:26.300
Good evening, Mr. Toorop.
I'm Dr. Darquandier, Aurora's father.

627
01:18:29.804 --> 01:18:31.704
Thought you were dead.

628
01:18:31.806 --> 01:18:35.242
It's sometimes useful to be dead.
It allows one a second chance.

629
01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.243
You'll see.

630
01:18:38.913 --> 01:18:42.007
Oh, yes.
You were clinically dead for two hours.

631
01:18:42.116 --> 01:18:45.051
I fixed you up as best I could.

632
01:18:45.153 --> 01:18:47.553
We lost quite a bit of time
getting you from the morgue.

633
01:18:47.655 --> 01:18:51.216
And then you went
into a coma for five days.

634
01:18:51.325 --> 01:18:54.920
Now, Mr. Toorop,
I believe I owe you some explanation.

635
01:18:57.198 --> 01:18:59.877
You see, 20 years ago I was drummed out
of the medical profession...

636
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:04.565
for trying to implant human babies
with artificial intelligence.

637
01:19:04.672 --> 01:19:08.631
Around that time, the Noelites
came to me with an unusual offer.

638
01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:12.042
They wanted me to do exactly what
the rest of the world was scared of.

639
01:19:12.146 --> 01:19:14.444
That is, to create
a supernatural human being...

640
01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:17.609
with the complete knowledge of
the world imprinted in her memory.

641
01:19:17.718 --> 01:19:21.119
So I built a supercomputer...

642
01:19:21.222 --> 01:19:23.884
to be Aurora's
artificial mother.

643
01:19:23.991 --> 01:19:28.826
As a fetus, Aurora learned
to process information...

644
01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:31.728
just like a computer.

645
01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.267
But when she was born...

646
01:19:34.368 --> 01:19:36.268
she became much more
than just an experiment.

647
01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:38.634
You see, she became-

648
01:19:38.739 --> 01:19:40.639
she became my daughter.

649
01:19:40.741 --> 01:19:44.609
She was beautiful. She was unique. And
I couldn't bring myself to give her away.

650
01:19:44.712 --> 01:19:47.237
That's when they hired
Gorsky to kill me.

651
01:19:47.348 --> 01:19:50.875
Well, he almost succeeded.

652
01:19:50.985 --> 01:19:53.852
He took my baby away.

653
01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:56.617
I searched for her for years.
I couldn't find her.

654
01:19:56.724 --> 01:19:59.625
I knew that one day the Noelites
would have to present their miracle...

655
01:19:59.727 --> 01:20:02.753
to the rest of the world.

656
01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:10.794
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to find my daughter.

657
01:20:10.905 --> 01:20:14.341
We think she's alive
and that she planned everything.

658
01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.342
She even shot you
with a purpose.

659
01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:20.005
You see,
you died with your eyes open.

660
01:20:20.114 --> 01:20:22.582
But your brain recorded more
than you can actually remember.

661
01:20:22.683 --> 01:20:27.120
We just need to rewind the tape
and fiddle with your memory.

662
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:31.290
I was dead.

663
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.451
Precisely.

664
01:20:38.933 --> 01:20:41.868
People are starving
for any kind of miracle.

665
01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:45.803
We were the provider,
and we had the copyright.

666
01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:50.367
250 million followers today.
Two billion tomorrow.

667
01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:53.003
This is what Aurora represented.

668
01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:55.309
Our stock options were sky high...

669
01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:58.476
and the whole world
was waiting for a revelation.

670
01:20:58.586 --> 01:21:02.181
But not anymore.
Aurora was our trademark.

671
01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:07.592
But now our trademark has disappeared
in a ball of fire like a cheap magic trick!

672
01:21:07.695 --> 01:21:12.462
And you morons can't even find
a single D.N.A. string to rebuild her.

673
01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:15.968
We are finally on the verge
of becoming a bona fide religion...

674
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:20.598
and your incompetence has thrown 20
years of careful planning down the tubes.

675
01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:23.006
Who gave the order
to use guns to retrieve her?

676
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:26.671
You left Gorsky no choice!
What were you thinking?

677
01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:29.426
Try not to get upset, Your Highness.
It's bad for your blood pressure.

678
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:32.851
Stop fussing. Well?

679
01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:35.616
Does anyone
have any suggestions?

680
01:21:35.723 --> 01:21:37.918
What should we do?

681
01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:43.321
Your Highness,
we want to launch a campaign...

682
01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:46.366
to inform the people that
we were targets of a terrorist attack.

683
01:21:46.467 --> 01:21:48.367
We need to be proactive,
not victims!

684
01:21:48.469 --> 01:21:53.532
In six months, we can offer a closer look
at God through our new space module.

685
01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:56.269
We need a miracle,
not another gadget!

686
01:21:56.377 --> 01:21:58.277
What?

687
01:21:58.379 --> 01:22:00.279
The body stolen from the morgue
was Toorop's.

688
01:22:00.381 --> 01:22:03.009
The police found the van
that transported him in New Jersey.

689
01:22:04.518 --> 01:22:08.716
Who would want to abduct
the body of a dead man?

690
01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.261
What am I looking for?

691
01:22:15.363 --> 01:22:18.025
What you missed the first time.

692
01:22:18.132 --> 01:22:20.600
We'll guide your memory
with our computer.

693
01:22:21.702 --> 01:22:23.602
Are you ready,
Mr. Toorop?

694
01:22:23.704 --> 01:22:25.604
I hope so.

695
01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:42.222
Fast forward. Fast forward.
Not too fast.

696
01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:47.059
Those are his wars.
Don't bring him too far back.

697
01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:55.563
- We're losing control. He's going back too far.
- Kill!

698
01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:58.332
That's his childhood. Bring him back.
Don't lead him there.

699
01:23:00.908 --> 01:23:02.808
Bring him forward.

700
01:23:18.092 --> 01:23:20.617
Not on the Noelites. On
the bikers. On the bikers.

701
01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:25.296
All right.

702
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:32.598
He's way past
the danger threshold.

703
01:23:35.242 --> 01:23:37.608
Everyone, slow down.

704
01:23:39.213 --> 01:23:40.771
Slow him down now!
Slow down!

705
01:23:46.153 --> 01:23:47.643
Let's wait.
Let's wait. Let's wait!

706
01:24:01.936 --> 01:24:04.461
I need you to live.

707
01:24:22.022 --> 01:24:25.253
He's dead.

708
01:24:25.359 --> 01:24:28.590
Wait.
Don't bring him back yet.

709
01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:07.800
Go home.

710
01:25:11.839 --> 01:25:15.172
It's all right. It's all right, Toorop.
You're back. You're safe.

711
01:25:18.312 --> 01:25:21.179
"Go home."
What does it mean?

712
01:25:24.852 --> 01:25:26.945
How'd she survive the blast?

713
01:25:27.054 --> 01:25:29.284
It's the babies, you see.

714
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.858
They're gaining power.

715
01:25:31.959 --> 01:25:34.951
They're the ones guiding her.

716
01:25:35.062 --> 01:25:39.658
Her capacity for survival is greater than
anything we could ever have imagined.

717
01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.394
Survival of the fittest.

718
01:25:43.103 --> 01:25:45.469
We're a pathetic race, really.

719
01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:48.804
We stopped evolving
at a critical point.

720
01:25:48.909 --> 01:25:52.276
Machines have evolved infinitely further
in the past 200 years.

721
01:25:52.379 --> 01:25:54.438
And that's what
I tried to correct with Aurora.

722
01:25:54.548 --> 01:25:56.573
Her babies are our future.

723
01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:59.118
They are the real miracle.

724
01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:05.821
You tried to correct mankind
by creating a Virgin Mary.

725
01:26:05.926 --> 01:26:09.089
The Noelites have found us.
They'll be here in two minutes.

726
01:26:10.364 --> 01:26:13.527
Find my daughter.
You're the only one now.

727
01:26:16.136 --> 01:26:20.095
Mr. Gorsky.
I hoped I wouldn't have to see you again.

728
01:26:20.207 --> 01:26:22.107
Where is my money?
You still haven't paid me.

729
01:26:22.209 --> 01:26:26.270
- You have an odd way of killing people.
- What are you talking about?

730
01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.508
I'm on my way to see our old friend-
Darquandier.

731
01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:32.711
Impossible!
I made his car explode myself.

732
01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.789
Mr. Gorsky, when I kill,
I kill for good.

733
01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:38.120
- Are you threatening me?
- Bless your soul.

734
01:26:38.225 --> 01:26:40.216
You need a nuke to kill me!

735
01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:45.330
Bitch.

736
01:26:53.173 --> 01:26:56.438
Our satellites have spotted two vehicles
leaving the compound.

737
01:26:56.544 --> 01:27:00.310
- It's too late to intercept them.
- I'm sick and tired of your damn excuses.

738
01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:38.009
Hello, my dear.
It's lovely to see you.

739
01:27:38.118 --> 01:27:40.951
- Where's my daughter?
- I see you haven't found her.

740
01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:43.353
And you never will.

741
01:27:43.457 --> 01:27:45.618
You selfish bastard.

742
01:27:45.726 --> 01:27:48.889
Twenty years ago I gave you
the opportunity you wanted.

743
01:27:48.996 --> 01:27:50.964
Now it's my moment.

744
01:27:52.166 --> 01:27:55.602
- Where is my daughter?
- She's not your daughter.

745
01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:58.228
- She comes from me!
- I designed her!

746
01:27:58.339 --> 01:28:00.307
For me!

747
01:28:00.407 --> 01:28:03.774
She's my miracle!
She belongs to my church!

748
01:28:03.877 --> 01:28:07.711
Your church is a lie! You're
peddling miracles for your own profit!

749
01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:18.922
Are you willing to die for her?

750
01:28:19.026 --> 01:28:20.926
Yes.

751
01:28:21.028 --> 01:28:23.622
Why?

752
01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:26.632
For a reason
you will never understand.

753
01:28:28.402 --> 01:28:30.962
Love?

754
01:28:31.071 --> 01:28:32.971
I understand love.

755
01:28:43.817 --> 01:28:46.115
Find Toorop.
He knows where she is.

756
01:29:21.755 --> 01:29:23.655
Wait here.

757
01:30:00.494 --> 01:30:02.394
Toorop.

758
01:30:28.722 --> 01:30:30.849
You're finally home.

759
01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.358
What's left of it.

760
01:30:37.831 --> 01:30:40.527
But I came back for you.

761
01:30:43.704 --> 01:30:45.604
Have a little faith.

762
01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:02.950
I thought I had saved her.

763
01:31:07.227 --> 01:31:09.320
But I was wrong.

764
01:31:18.672 --> 01:31:21.140
Aurora was designed to breed.

765
01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.109
The perfect holy virgin
can't live in flesh.

766
01:31:32.286 --> 01:31:35.084
She was just a vessel...

767
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:38.283
a prototype
that wasn't built to last.

768
01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:44.930
She was programmed
to create new life...

769
01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.635
and disappear.

770
01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:59.908
They say she won't wake up
before she gives birth.

771
01:32:01.882 --> 01:32:04.544
But I'm here...

772
01:32:04.651 --> 01:32:06.551
waiting.

773
01:32:17.497 --> 01:32:19.397
Toorop.

774
01:32:34.047 --> 01:32:36.880
Thank you...

775
01:32:36.984 --> 01:32:39.418
for protecting us.

776
01:33:08.615 --> 01:33:10.879
You're their father now.

777
01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.861
Aurora.

778
01:33:31.905 --> 01:33:36.103
That's the first time
you've said my name.

779
01:34:01.368 --> 01:34:03.598
Save the planet...

780
01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:06.673
one child at a time.

781
01:34:06.773 --> 01:34:08.741
Ain't that a bitch.
