18

23
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.520
<i>Since Kazakhstan's
independence six years ago...</i>

24
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.290
Get out here!

25
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.010
Come here!

26
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.520
Get back!

27
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.610
You remember me?

28
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.980
You sold me a gun that don't work.

29
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.098
It almost got me killed.

30
00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.333
I paid $20 for this.

31
00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:34.650
I want my money back.

32
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.660
Give me this.

33
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:05.361
How much.
Five Ruble.

34
00:05:05.662 --> 00:05:06.862
How much?

35
00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:08.463
Four.
Ok.

36
00:05:11.564 --> 00:05:13.164
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

37
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.530
Toorop.

38
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.750
I'll save you some.
Is that a bunny?

39
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.185
Hey, Toorop.

40
00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:54.122
Toorop.

41
00:05:54.523 --> 00:05:55.890
Somebody came by looking for you.

42
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400
Ok.

43
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.320
<i>If the chief U.S. interest at this

44
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.350

45
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.130
<i>Boy, what a massacre.</i>

46
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.240
<i>The victims were killed as they
were visiting the factory</i>

47
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.790
<i>in a northeastern
Kazakhstan province.</i>

48
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.090
<i>At the peak of the rush hour,
bombs were detonated...</i>

49
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.480
<i>in three crowded trains
and aboard a bus.</i>

50
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.010
<i>At least 50...</i>

51
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.350
Get up Toorop.

52
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.980
Karl, is that you?

53
00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:51.681
I don't repeat it twice.

54
00:07:51.682 --> 00:07:52.582
Get up.

55
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.070
I thought you were in Sudan,
killing babies.

56
00:07:56.071 --> 00:07:56.999
Shut up.

57
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.840
Remember the last time we met?

58
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.930
I told you if you ever point
that gun at me again.

59
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520
I'd kill you.

60
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:05.521
Get up.

61
00:08:05.522 --> 00:08:06.609
Move your ass!

62
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.610
Who would hire a baby killer
to get me...

63
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.660
Who?

64
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:16.261
Do not shoot!

65
00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:18.162
He don't want to kill you.

66
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.230
Just talk.

67
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.590
No shit, Karl.

68
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.480
If you wanted me dead,
you would've blown up the building.

69
00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:23.700
Who?

70
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.760
Gorsky.

71
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.330
Karl, you're a disgrace
to the profession.

72
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.360
You're not a mercenary,
you're a fucking terrorist.

73
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.800
You need two things to live in this
business, your balls and your word.

74
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.990
You don't have either.

75
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.070
Know the difference between
you and me, Karl?

76
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.910
I still got both.

77
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:53.599
Damn it!
Do not shoot!

78
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.610
Take it easy.

79
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.799
Bastard, he killed him!

80
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.960
That was just personal
between him and me.

81
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.530
Let me get my things.

82
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.310
Amateurs.

83
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.430
Toorop.

84
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.760
See you, kid.
Thank you, Toorop.

85
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:41.561
Fuck off!

86
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.990
You are a hard man to find, Toorop.

87
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.310
I'm not hiding.

88
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.210
You could've knocked.

89
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.050
I needed to be sure that
you were the same idealist...

90
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.460
who worked for me 10 years ago.

91
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.180
So you knew I was gonna kill Karl.

92
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.460
I don't like you, Gorsky.

93
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.420
You can't trust me
and I can't trust you.

94
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.810
This is not about trust.

95
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.884
This is about...

96
00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:19.510
professionalism,

97
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.730
ethics.

98
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.440
Ethics?

99
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.770
If it's about ethics,
I should kill you right now.

100
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.620
And you think that would
make the world a better place?

101
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.075
Look at you,

102
00:11:32.476 --> 00:11:33.880
still in this shit-hole.

103
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.869
Surviving.

104
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.420
Sleeping with your gun.

105
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.563
No friends.

106
00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.626
No family.

107
00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:40.640
No future.

108
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.200
We are the same.

109
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.280
You and me.

110
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.655
We're not the same.

111
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.470
What do you want?

112
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.000
I need a smuggler.

113
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.600
I don't do refugees anymore.

114
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.930
Use your own cargo.

115
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.574
You own the borders anyway.

116
00:11:56.575 --> 00:11:57.940
Only on this side.

117
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.106
This is an overseas delivery?

118
00:12:00.107 --> 00:12:01.170
A girl.

119
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.530
She needs to be in America
in six days.

120
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.390
Why are you playing with me?

121
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.210
You know I can't get back
into that country.

122
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.940
You know that U.N. passports
are impossible to fake.

123
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.130
This is not a fake.

124
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.580
Inject it in your neck when
you pass the official border.

125
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.040
This is your new life.

126
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.130
Clean credit.

127
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.570
John Doe.

128
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.900
What's the catch?

129
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.990
You have to make a choice.

130
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.780
That's the catch.

131
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.040
I'll do it for half a mil.

132
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.290
I can make you do it for free.

133
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.780
You can't make me do shit, Gorsky.

134
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.000
But you can pay me what I need
so I can get the job done right.

135
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.210
You got yourself a deal.

136
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.790
A car will pick you up outside,

137
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.930
to take you to the rendezvous point.

138
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.972
Cross me,

139
00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:19.960
and you'll have no place
to hide anymore,

140
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.630
Toorop.

141
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.730
That goes both ways,

142
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.870
Gorsky.

143
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.170
Shit.

144
00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.170
Good morning.

145
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.840
You must be Toorop?

146
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.480
I am Sister Rebeka.

147
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.310
I just want to bring three
simple rules to your attention,

148
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.200
before we start our journey.

149
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.500
We?

150
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.820
I'm here to pick up one girl.

151
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.274
Wherever she goes, I go.

152
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:41.050
That is rule number one.

153
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.660
Rule number two.

154
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.740
The less contact she has with
the outside world, the better.

155
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.540
You're here to protect her
from outside influences.

156
00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.720
That includes seeing,
hearing and feeling.

157
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.790
You know, it's a harsh world
out there, Sister.

158
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.885
I know.

159
00:17:56.886 --> 00:17:58.560
That is why we live in here.

160
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.210
Shit, ok.
What's your third rule?

161
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.950
No foul language.

162
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.170
Do we have an agreement?

163
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.260
You listen to my one and only rule.

164
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.310
Don't fuck with me,

165
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.350
or I'll leave you standing
in the middle of nowhere,

166
00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:28.370
with nothing but your ass
to sell to get back here.

167
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:30.750
Your perfect world.

168
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.000
Do we have an agreement?

169
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.500
Obviously, you are not a gentleman.

170
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.840
Obviously not.

171
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.278
Now that we have an understanding,

172
00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:44.550
pick up the bags.

173
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:50.987
No.

174
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:55.730
Shit.

175
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.928
What's your name?

176
00:20:21.229 --> 00:20:22.300
My name?

177
00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.420
You don't have to talk to him.

178
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.850
You didn't introduce yourself.

179
00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.130
My name's Toorop.

180
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.090
Are you taking us to New York?

181
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.798
Yes.

182
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.720
Now please, get into the car.

183
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.630
Are you a killer, Mr. Toorop?

184
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.140
Look lady,

185
00:20:44.541 --> 00:20:46.260
I'm just a delivery boy.

186
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.290
And to me you're just a package.

187
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.150
I'm not your friend. I'm not your brother.
I'm not your boyfriend.

188
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.790
In six days, I'm gonna deliver
you and never see you again.

189
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.550
Sister Rebeka's right.

190
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.220
We shouldn't even talk.

191
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.610
Come on.

192
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.470
Comfy?

193
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.080
You wouldn't have a light, would you?

194
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.330
Figures.

195
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.370
Are you ok, baby girl?

196
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.720
I've never been this far.

197
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.370
Let's hurry up.
The train's gonna leave soon.

198
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.210
Take your bags.

199
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.660
Are you really going to need all that?

200
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.640
We could never have enough
firepower, Sister.

201
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.200
In fact...

202
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.800
I've never touched a gun in my life.

203
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.370
Now would be the perfect
moment to start.

204
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.640
No, thank you. I can defend myself.

205
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.440
Stay close. This is the real world.

206
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.160
There's no mercy for the weak.

207
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.130
Just because we're peaceful,
that doesn't mean we're weak.

208
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.110
It does here.

209
00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:54.790
Take this.

210
00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.810
Hurry.
Here.

211
00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.047
Change.

212
00:23:59.948 --> 00:24:01.010
What are you doing?

213
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.170
<i>That's him. We're locked on.</i>

214
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.578
<i>He's a big motherfucker.</i>

215
00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:11.390
<i>Look at him.</i>

216
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.720
<i>That won't be a problem.</i>

217
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.590
<i>And that's Aurora.</i>

218
00:24:16.291 --> 00:24:17.545
<i>She's cute.
Put this on.</i>

219
00:24:18.146 --> 00:24:19.700
<i>Let's stay concentrated, guys.</i>

220
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:21.890
Come on.

221
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:18.890
<i>What do we do now?</i>

222
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:20.910
<i>Hey no need to rush.
Let's give it time.</i>

223
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:22.830
Hang on.

224
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:24.359
You want tickets?

225
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.380
Ok, give me three.

226
00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:26.781
3 tickets?

227
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.840
Hey.

228
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.050
Where are you going?

229
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.458
What are you doing?

230
00:25:55.659 --> 00:25:56.659
Come on.

231
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.534
<i>Attention!</i>

232
00:26:03.135 --> 00:26:06.060
<i>Every passenger must go
through post control.</i>

233
00:26:07.561 --> 00:26:09.161
<i>Get your tickets ready.</i>

234
00:26:10.062 --> 00:26:12.962
<i>Pass by the platform is strictly limited.</i>

235
00:26:14.063 --> 00:26:16.063
<i>Show your tickets to the controllers.</i>

236
00:26:17.064 --> 00:26:19.864
<i>I repeat, everyone should
go through the post control.</i>

237
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.961
Hey!

238
00:26:23.362 --> 00:26:24.060
Hey!

239
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.400
Hey!

240
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.530
<i>Hey, something's happening
She's on the run.</i>

241
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.530
Aurora!
Toorop!

242
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.350
Aurora!

243
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.930
Don't go.
You will die.

244
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.630
What are you doing?
She's felt it.

245
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.720
Don't go that way.
She's not used to crowds.

246
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.420
We have to go now. We have no time.

247
00:27:06.421 --> 00:27:07.890
We have to get away.

248
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.010
What is wrong with you?

249
00:27:09.011 --> 00:27:10.440
Make her walk or I'll carry her.

250
00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:11.370
Stop. Don't touch her.

251
00:27:11.371 --> 00:27:12.600
Don't go that way.

252
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.635
We're going now.
No! Don't touch her.

253
00:27:13.636 --> 00:27:14.690
We have to get away.

254
00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.930
Don't touch her.
Let's go!

255
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.130
Come on.

256
00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.850
We'll to the train.

257
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.960
We need to catch it.
Come on.

258
00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.250
Come on. Move. Move.
Get out of the way. Move!

259
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.350
Hey, guys, can.. Can I...
I buy these three seats off you?

260
00:28:24.351 --> 00:28:25.339
Buy my goats.

261
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.170
Buy some more goats.

262
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.150
For you.

263
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.400
Those tigers in the cage...

264
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.400
they weren't real, right?

265
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.880
Siberian tigers went extinct in 2017.

266
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.040
The last one died in the Moscow Zoo.

267
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.700
What is she, a walking
wildlife encyclopedia?

268
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.200
They were clones?

269
00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.464
Second generation clones,

270
00:29:33.765 --> 00:29:34.980
not real tigers.

271
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.340
Copies of copies.

272
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.149
But they're living creatures,

273
00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.250
made by God.

274
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:44.010
No. They were organic machines
made by man.

275
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.050
God made man in his image.

276
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.190
So what man creates,
is also God's will.

277
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.230
Is this what you teach her
in the convent?

278
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.170
Then God would be pretty fucked
up to make man in his image.

279
00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.780
You wanna talk?

280
00:29:58.781 --> 00:30:00.850
Tell me what happened
at the marketplace.

281
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.430
I'm gonna protect you,

282
00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.950
I need to know what's
wrong with you.

283
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:12.730
She was scared.

284
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.640
It's the first time out of the convent,

285
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.940
and you put us in that situation.

286
00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.510
First time out of the convent?

287
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.269
So I'm probably delivering you
to some billionaire playboy,

288
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.960
who purchased you off the Internet.

289
00:31:33.849 --> 00:31:35.049
Stop, halt.

290
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.450
Here.

291
00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:40.551
<i>Bag.</i>

292
00:31:41.152 --> 00:31:42.652
<i>Please give your bag.</i>

293
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.850
Stop.

294
00:31:48.451 --> 00:31:49.651
Body armor too.

295
00:31:54.252 --> 00:31:55.252
Stop.

296
00:32:04.653 --> 00:32:06.353
Well, that's all, you are free.

297
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.770
Stay close.

298
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.446
What are we doing here?

299
00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:30.940
Looking for a friend.

300
00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.850
Come on. Come on.

301
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.090
<i>Sit over there.</i>

302
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.340
<i>I'll be right there in a minute.
And you, don't talk to anybody.</i>

303
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.800
<i>Yo, guys. They're separating.</i>

304
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:25.350
<i>Don't do anything stupid.
Wait.</i>

305
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.890
Get up, motherfucker.

306
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.900
Hey! Toorop!

307
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.100
How are you?

308
00:33:34.101 --> 00:33:34.866
How you doing?

309
00:33:35.267 --> 00:33:37.080
What you doing in this
beautiful part of Russia?

310
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:39.250
<i>Working.</i>

311
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.190
<i>Working for who?</i>

312
00:33:40.691 --> 00:33:41.910
<i>Hey, hey. Two shots.</i>

313
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.012
<i>Hold your positions.</i>

314
00:33:43.013 --> 00:33:44.270
<i>We're gonna move in.
Gorsky.</i>

315
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.190
He made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

316
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.230
What can I do for you?

317
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.860
I need three passes on the boat...

318
00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.830
and two snow bikes
on the other side.

319
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.244
You crossing?

320
00:34:01.245 --> 00:34:02.550
I'm delivering.

321
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.220
The girl.

322
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:07.918
Her?

323
00:34:09.019 --> 00:34:10.019
Who is she?

324
00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:12.480
I don't know.

325
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.570
Where you taking her?
America.

326
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.636
What America?
You're on a terrorist list there.

327
00:34:16.637 --> 00:34:17.660
Yeah.

328
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.110
You need a passport.
You need an identity.

329
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.880
You're kidding me.

330
00:34:22.181 --> 00:34:23.240
You got a passport?

331
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.918
Yeah, and I'm not coming back.

332
00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:26.370
That is a bold move.

333
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.770
I got 50 G's saying
you can help me out.

334
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:30.450
When?

335
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.300
Now.

336
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.160
You don't have to look.

337
00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.090
Who is he?

338
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:54.940
He's a lost soul

339
00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.990
See you at the landing at 0600 sharp.

340
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.320
You got it.

341
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:05.843
Who was that?

342
00:35:05.844 --> 00:35:07.020
An old friend. A good smuggler.

343
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.916
You trust him? I don't trust anybody.

344
00:35:08.917 --> 00:35:09.917
Come on.

345
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:16.262
Sorry, kids.

346
00:35:16.263 --> 00:35:17.380
These girls are with me.

347
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.452
Just let her go, Toorop.

348
00:35:18.453 --> 00:35:20.050
How do you know my name?

349
00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:21.451
We know a lot of things
you don't know.

350
00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:22.670
Yeah, like what?

351
00:35:22.871 --> 00:35:24.450
Like you don't know what you're doing.

352
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.990
I'm doing my job.
Fuck your job.

353
00:35:27.991 --> 00:35:28.727
What?

354
00:35:28.728 --> 00:35:29.990
One million, tax free.

355
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.580
Take the money and
walk out without a fight.

356
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.590
Make it easy on yourself, Toorop.

357
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:06.870
Move!

358
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.900
Aurora!

359
00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.610
Toorop!

360
00:37:03.636 --> 00:37:04.557
Toorop!
No!

361
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:26.350
Hey.

362
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.117
Aurora!
Hey man.

363
00:37:28.318 --> 00:37:29.460
Let the girl go.

364
00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.220
Just let her go. Let her go.

365
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.180
Hey, man. Hey.
Hey. I don't...

366
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:47.740
No!

367
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.163
Get over there!

368
00:37:52.564 --> 00:37:53.840
You wanna fight?

369
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.540
Ok, man.

370
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.280
Aurora!

371
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.030
Stop!

372
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:11.330
Stop!

373
00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:12.760
Stop it!

374
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.297
Stop it!

375
00:39:15.798 --> 00:39:16.570
Stop!

376
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.200
Don't kill him!

377
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.360
He doesn't want to hurt me.

378
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.990
He wanted to protect me!

379
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.704
Your father sent us.

380
00:39:39.005 --> 00:39:39.905
My father?

381
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.580
Get away from her.
Get away from her!

382
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:44.670
It's ok, Aurora.

383
00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.350
I have to know.
No.

384
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.440
Aurora!

385
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:49.770
Aurora.

386
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.229
Aurora! Aurora!

387
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.360
Listen to me. Stop!

388
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.110
Toorop! Toorop!

389
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.150
Come on.

390
00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.300
Let's go.
Hurry up.

391
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.850
Move it.

392
00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.030
Come on!

393
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.410
Go! Go!

394
00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:50.950
Stop!

395
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.160
Let her go!

396
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:03.940
Next one dies!

397
00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.017
Come with us.

398
00:41:09.018 --> 00:41:10.490
They're ready to die for you.

399
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.770
I don't want anybody to die for me.

400
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.380
What do you think you're doing?

401
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.689
What's wrong with you?

402
00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.750
You think this is a game?

403
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.910
Why did you shoot them?
You trying to get us killed?

404
00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:38.760
Why didn't you let me go?
You don't know them!

405
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.880
Well, what are you gonna do,
shoot me in the head?

406
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:42.321
Shoot me like an animal?

407
00:41:43.022 --> 00:41:44.022
Stop it!

408
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.890
I told you I'd take you
to New York, and I will.

409
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:40.370
This is way too many refugees, man.

410
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:43.240
The ice is getting thinner every year.

411
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.610
They're losing cargo all the time.

412
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.740
We're not gonna all get on the boat.

413
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.650
Make sure we do.

414
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:59.260
This goddamn global
warming's bad for business.

415
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.520
What's happening?

416
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.230
Watch this.

417
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.330
There's not much time.

418
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.690
They don't wanna be spotted
by satellites.

419
00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.190
Hurry. Come on!

420
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.300
Come on!

421
00:44:37.701 --> 00:44:39.201
<i>Dive in two minutes.</i>

422
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:50.080
Move!

423
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:51.670
Come on!

424
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.500
No!

425
00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:35.850
No!

426
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.854
You can't do this!

427
00:45:40.855 --> 00:45:42.330
They'll die out there!

428
00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.700
No!

429
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.400
You can't do this.
Get away from the controls.

430
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.592
What are you doing?

431
00:45:49.593 --> 00:45:50.593
Stop it.
No!

432
00:45:50.694 --> 00:45:51.465
Don't do that!

433
00:45:51.466 --> 00:45:52.680
What's wrong?
Put it down.

434
00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.960
No. Don't.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

435
00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:58.044
Take it easy.

436
00:45:58.045 --> 00:45:59.320
Hey, take it easy.

437
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.500
We go back up.

438
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.970
Now!

439
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.210
Ok. ok.

440
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:07.370
Relax.

441
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:08.390
We go back up.

442
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:11.000
Now.

443
00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:12.820
Relax.

444
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:14.500
Calm down.

445
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.490
I feel them!

446
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.160
I feel them!

447
00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:20.660
I feel them dying!

448
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:22.680
I feel them dying!

449
00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:26.900
The whole Bering Sea is dead!

450
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:39.650
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What the fuck was that?

451
00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.260
I was 17 years old,

452
00:46:50.261 --> 00:46:51.870
living in San Francisco.

453
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.750
My life was a mess.

454
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:56.840
I met the wrong man.

455
00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.490
I was lost in darkness.

456
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.660
But then the high priestess of
our church opened the doors,

457
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:05.790
that led me on to the path of light.

458
00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.920
I joined the Noelites,

459
00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.940
and I ended up in the convent.

460
00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.120
It was a haven for women
who needed to heal.

461
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.620
I worked in the orphanage.

462
00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:24.850
She arrived.

463
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:27.590
A little baby.

464
00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.370
Her father was dead.

465
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:33.950
Nobody knew anything
about the mother.

466
00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.480
I took her as my own.

467
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:39.237
I fed her.

468
00:47:39.638 --> 00:47:40.710
I taught her.

469
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:42.510
Everything was fine...

470
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.960
until three months ago.

471
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.609
The doctor came.

472
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:48.630
He gave her a pill.

473
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.330
He was with her for 10 minutes,

474
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.770
and then she slowly started to change.

475
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.482
But nothing...

476
00:47:54.483 --> 00:47:57.310
nothing as violent as what
you saw today.

477
00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.690
But something's not making sense.

478
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.650
How could she know how to
operate a 30 year old Russian sub?

479
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.710
She's always known things
that she never experienced.

480
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.740
Aurora could speak when
she was two years old.

481
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.920
A lot of kids speak at two...
Nineteen different languages.

482
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.510
Who else knows about this?

483
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:31.280
Nobody but the doctor.

484
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.400
He told me to keep it
a secret to protect her.

485
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.180
He said...

486
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.360
that we would get the best
medical help in America.

487
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:46.470
She needs help.

488
00:48:50.071 --> 00:48:51.371
<i>To the crew.</i>

489
00:48:51.772 --> 00:48:52.972
<i>Get ready for surface.</i>

490
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.900
Get her ready.

491
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.830
You know two years ago...

492
00:49:16.831 --> 00:49:19.840
in Uzbekistan I saw
this viral bomb go off.

493
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:21.640
It was...

494
00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:26.440
It was incredible. Everybody died.

495
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:33.280
She's carrying, ain't she?

496
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.599
All the symptoms fit.

497
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.790
All that weird behavior,

498
00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:42.720
I'm telling you, man
she is carrying a weapon.

499
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.030
You have any idea
how much money she's worth?

500
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.540
If she's carrying a virus,

501
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.180
I'll kill her myself and burn the body.

502
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.710
<i>What happened to them?
Fighter drones.</i>

503
00:50:35.711 --> 00:50:37.611
<i>Anything that moves is shot on sight.</i>

504
00:50:37.612 --> 00:50:40.009
<i>Now we're in the zone.
It's 10 miles to the D.M.Z.</i>

505
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.987
<i>Then let's make it 10 fast miles.</i>

506
00:50:41.988 --> 00:50:42.790
<i>Let's go!</i>

507
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.330
<i>Toorop, they're coming!</i>

508
00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:04.210
<i>Shit. Finn, we're spotted. Hit it!</i>

509
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:14.600
<i>Break!</i>

510
00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.118
<i>Finn, get close to me!</i>

511
00:51:21.319 --> 00:51:22.580
<i>Finn, now!</i>

512
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:24.660
<i>Aurora, jump onto our bike.</i>

513
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.460
<i>I'll draw them off.
You three, hide here.</i>

514
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:04.890
<i>What are you doing?</i>

515
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.530
<i>Toorop cleared our way out.</i>

516
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:08.190
<i>We're almost at the border.</i>

517
00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.540
<i>Toorop, we need you now!</i>

518
00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:27.714
<i>It's gonna shoot us!</i>

519
00:52:27.915 --> 00:52:29.360
<i>Toorop. Toorop!</i>

520
00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:35.990
<i>Stop!</i>

521
00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:57.350
Toorop!

522
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:02.390
He's not dead!

523
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:05.640
Shit!

524
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:07.700
Hey, stay with me.

525
00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.487
He's not reacting.

526
00:53:10.788 --> 00:53:12.200
He's bleeding to death.

527
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.443
I need your help.

528
00:53:13.844 --> 00:53:14.380
Ok.

529
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.350
We gotta get outta here now.

530
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:22.492
It's a small piece of metal.

531
00:53:22.893 --> 00:53:23.910
I'm gonna take it out.

532
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.130
What do you need?

533
00:53:25.131 --> 00:53:26.180
Just hold him.

534
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.580
Look, we don't have time
for this, ok?

535
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.400
They're gonna send more drones!

536
00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.580
Aurora?

537
00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:37.821
You got it?

538
00:53:38.322 --> 00:53:39.360
I got it.

539
00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:41.160
It's ok.
Give me a bandage

540
00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.180
We should never have turned back.

541
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:46.640
He knows the rules.

542
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:49.440
I'll sew it up later.

543
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:52.170
Hey!

544
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.490
Now you and the passport are mine.

545
00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.691
What are you doing?

546
00:53:57.992 --> 00:53:59.670
You, I don't need.

547
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:15.240
Like I said, trust no one.

548
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:34.182
It's good.

549
00:54:34.683 --> 00:54:35.960
Where did you learn to cook?

550
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.120
Rule number one
in the mercenary handbook.

551
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.900
You never had a woman
take care of you?

552
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:43.960
Sorry.

553
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.340
No, not in my line of work.

554
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.220
Finished.

555
00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.720
She gets pleasure out of this.

556
00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.676
Cry baby.

557
00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:56.410
Cry baby?

558
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.980
What is that?

559
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:05.627
Painkiller?

560
00:55:06.528 --> 00:55:07.560
No, thank you.

561
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.451
Live a little.

562
00:55:09.452 --> 00:55:11.150
No.

563
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.250
Aurora, stop!

564
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.350
Spit it out.

565
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:21.160
Yuck!

566
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:23.942
Girls,

567
00:55:25.443 --> 00:55:27.140
we made it across the border.

568
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.160
Here's to survival.

569
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.240
And thank you for saving my life.

570
00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.600
Maybe now you can trust somebody.

571
00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.462
We protected each other,

572
00:55:39.863 --> 00:55:40.863
like family.

573
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:48.160
We are all going to die in New York.

574
00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:56.740
Good night.

575
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.390
She's just scared.

576
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:12.660
Yeah, right.

577
00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:52.720
Go back to sleep.

578
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.930
We still have a long way ahead of us.

579
00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.040
What are you doing?

580
00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.630
We go through customs tomorrow.

581
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:06.200
I can't take these.

582
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:20.400
You know, when Sister Rebeka
first held me as a baby,

583
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.680
it was a night like this.

584
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.580
Aurora.

585
00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.640
That's where I got my name.

586
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.910
From the chaos.

587
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:32.700
It suits you.

588
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.014
You're risking your life for me.

589
00:57:38.715 --> 00:57:39.715
Why?

590
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:43.700
I've done my time.

591
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.948
All this killing and pain and...

592
00:57:48.949 --> 00:57:49.949
war...

593
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.180
For what?

594
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:54.120
I'm tired...

595
00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.670
tired of it all.

596
00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:01.640
And you're my only chance
out of this hell.

597
00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:02.950
And go where?

598
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:07.760
27 Cedar Grove.

599
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.210
Near Canada.
It's upstate New York.

600
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:15.340
My parents had a farm...

601
00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.050
more like a cabin with a lot of land.

602
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:24.810
It's probably in ruins,
but I might be able to fix it up.

603
00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.550
There is no place like home.

604
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.970
But Kansas ain't what it used to be.

605
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.470
The Wizard of Oz.

606
00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:43.110
1939.

607
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.260
That's right.

608
00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:54.950
Toorop?

609
00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:01.600
Are you really going to kill me
and burn my body?

610
00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:06.930
I hope I won't have to.

611
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.250
<i>You have reached the
limit of your water credit.</i>

612
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:45.440
<i>To purchase more credit,
enter your room number now.</i>

613
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.330
Thirty minutes.
The bus leaves in 30 minutes.

614
01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:20.000
Last plane to New York,
in two hours.

615
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.580
Your Highness,
they've crossed the Canadian border.

616
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.360
She's coming.

617
01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.290
Let's pray.

618
01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.620
A miracle in the making.

619
01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.750
Trust. Invest in our new faith

620
01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.770
Right here, girls.

621
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:08.380
<i>Welcome, Mr. Johnson.</i>

622
01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.670
<i>Your multimedia system is loading.</i>

623
01:04:10.671 --> 01:04:12.690
<i>We wish you a pleasant stay.</i>
It's ok.

624
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:14.830
It's safe here.

625
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.030
Here.

626
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:55.101
Hey,

627
01:04:56.102 --> 01:04:57.200
there is no food.

628
01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:00.170
Guess we're not gonna be here long.

629
01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.039
What's wrong?

630
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.260
They are all dead.

631
01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.080
<i>Sources report the destruction
in Kyrgyzstan,</i>

632
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.900
<i>of a 1,000 year old convent,</i>

633
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:26.210
<i>one of the oldest continually
functioning convents in Central Asia.</i>

634
01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.640
<i>Now occupied by an ascetic
branch of the Noelites,</i>

635
01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:32.190
<i>the convent was struck by
a missile late last night.</i>

636
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:33.890
<i>There were no survivors.</i>

637
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.760
<i>Here, an initial reaction
from the Noelites.</i>

638
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.590
<i>It is a tragedy to think
that even defenseless women,</i>

639
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:43.290
<i>who made the choice
to withdraw from society,</i>

640
01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.390
<i>and lead a life of purity,</i>

641
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.700
<i>should suffer the attacks of terrorists,</i>

642
01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:51.000
<i>who have absolutely no respect
for the lives of decent,</i>

643
01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:52.320
<i>God-fearing people.</i>

644
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.620
<i>We shall mourn our sisters...</i>

645
01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:59.320
<i>and continue their legacy
for world peace,</i>

646
01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:00.800
<i>through obedience,</i>

647
01:06:00.801 --> 01:06:02.164
<i>purification,</i>

648
01:06:02.165 --> 01:06:03.165
<i>and hope...</i>

649
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.780
<i>for the miracle we so desperately need.</i>

650
01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:14.550
<i>Congratulations my friend.</i>

651
01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.475
<i>You made it safe and sound.</i>

652
01:06:17.776 --> 01:06:18.830
Gorsky.

653
01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:21.530
Did you destroy that convent?

654
01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:23.444
<i>I'm not a terrorist, Toorop.</i>

655
01:06:23.445 --> 01:06:25.080
<i>I'm a mercenary, like you.</i>

656
01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.098
Bullshit.

657
01:06:27.299 --> 01:06:28.500
What the hell is going?

658
01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.400
What the hell is going on over here?

659
01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.890
You didn't leave me a gun.
<i>You've done your job.</i>

660
01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.340
<i>A doctor is coming in a few minutes.</i>

661
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:37.800
<i>If she's ok, you're home free,</i>

662
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.270
<i>and the tracking device in your
passport will be deactivated.</i>

663
01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:43.640
<i>Don't make us use it.</i>

664
01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:51.310
Sometimes it's hard to understand,

665
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.186
but I believe God...

666
01:06:54.187 --> 01:06:56.190
has a reason for everything
that happens.

667
01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.630
What reason could there be?

668
01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:03.860
They never hurt anybody.

669
01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.180
Maybe it was an accident.

670
01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.230
It was not an accident.

671
01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:15.210
It was destroyed right
after we crossed the border.

672
01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:19.890
Would you like to pray with me?

673
01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.250
I don't feel like praying anymore.

674
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:39.220
Toorop said I'm just a package to him.

675
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.400
Why did you bring me here?

676
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.500
Because I couldn't take care
of you anymore.

677
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.670
How is she?

678
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.830
Scared.

679
01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:15.780
Yeah. Well, she should be.

680
01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.332
Who are they?

681
01:08:19.733 --> 01:08:23.650
To the left, the Range Rover goons
work for your sect, the Noelites.

682
01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.752
To the right,

683
01:08:26.153 --> 01:08:28.080
the bikers work for Gorsky.

684
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:36.420
They're all here to make sure I deliver.

685
01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:37.900
And if we don't?

686
01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.840
It's gonna be a free for all.

687
01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.350
Look, Sister,

688
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:53.320
we traveled 6,000 miles together.

689
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:56.690
The truth is this has been a
suicide mission from the beginning.

690
01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.760
They won't let either one
of us walk out of here alive.

691
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.162
That's why they destroyed
the convent.

692
01:09:02.163 --> 01:09:03.340
That's the doctor,

693
01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:05.530
they came to the convent
three months ago.

694
01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.120
Ok.

695
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:17.633
Good evening, Sister.

696
01:09:17.934 --> 01:09:18.950
Good evening.

697
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.030
Good evening.

698
01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.236
Where is she?

699
01:09:27.937 --> 01:09:29.200
In the room.

700
01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.630
Good.

701
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:22.520
You're a bad man.

702
01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.200
They're more powerful
than we expected.

703
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:38.960
Thank you, Aurora

704
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:41.270
Thank you so much.

705
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:58.799
How is she?

706
01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.830
She's fine.

707
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.446
I have to run some more tests.

708
01:11:01.447 --> 01:11:02.450
More tests?

709
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:04.350
Standard...
Hey, you just ran your test.

710
01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.636
What's wrong with her?

711
01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:06.560
Expect a call from...

712
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.730
What is wrong with her?

713
01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:10.520
Toorop.

714
01:11:10.921 --> 01:11:11.930
Toorop.

715
01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:13.660
Let him go.

716
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.260
If you please.

717
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.660
Thank you, Sister.

718
01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.780
Get over here!
What's wrong with you?

719
01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:32.304
I want to know everything that you know.

720
01:11:32.305 --> 01:11:33.350
Don't you think...

721
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:34.979
that if I knew anything,

722
01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.700
I would tell you?

723
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:37.971
No, I don't think.

724
01:11:38.572 --> 01:11:39.711
You're a Noelite.

725
01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:40.740
You're like him.

726
01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:41.865
You swore an oath.

727
01:11:42.166 --> 01:11:43.026
Not to them.

728
01:11:43.427 --> 01:11:44.430
To God.

729
01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.498
God has nothing to do with it now!

730
01:11:47.199 --> 01:11:48.230
You understand?

731
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.440
If she's carrying a virus,
she can annihilate half the city,

732
01:11:50.530 --> 01:11:52.250
and I'm not gonna have it
on my conscience!

733
01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.420
How can you believe that about her?
I don't know what I believe anymore!

734
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:07.353
I'm pregnant.

735
01:12:07.754 --> 01:12:08.800
Twins.

736
01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:12.078
It's not possible.

737
01:12:12.779 --> 01:12:14.510
I've watched over you all your life.

738
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:17.040
No one's ever touched you.

739
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:21.960
And nobody has.

740
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.140
Shit.

741
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.373
Toorop,

742
01:12:31.274 --> 01:12:32.600
they just want my babies.

743
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.510
Yes.

744
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.320
<i>Mr. Toorop?</i>

745
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.848
<i>This is the Noelite Church C.E.O.</i>

746
01:12:40.849 --> 01:12:42.340
I know who you are.

747
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:46.014
<i>Thank you for doing such
a good job, Mr. Toorop.</i>

748
01:12:46.815 --> 01:12:47.870
You're welcome.

749
01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:50.400
<i>Please bring the girl to the limousine,</i>

750
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:52.540
<i>and your mission is accomplished.</i>

751
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.150
We're on our way out.

752
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:06.202
<i>Alright, guys.</i>

753
01:13:06.603 --> 01:13:08.260
<i>Are you ready?</i>

754
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:24.400
<i>Keep them in sight, guys</i>

755
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.420
We can't let her go, Toorop.

756
01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.280
Look around.
Do we have a choice?

757
01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.570
She's your problem now.

758
01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.260
Thank you, Toorop.

759
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.860
We're going in the subway.

760
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.070
What's wrong?

761
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.880
It's a missile linked to my passport.

762
01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.271
How can you stop it?

763
01:14:34.272 --> 01:14:35.590
Only by death.

764
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:39.290
Get on the subway!

765
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.700
Toorop.

766
01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:11.520
Aurora!

767
01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.200
I need you to live.

768
01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.940
<i>He's back to life.</i>

769
01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:51.113
<i>Scars are all gone.</i>

770
01:17:51.114 --> 01:17:52.900
Doctor hasn't lost his touch.

771
01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.450
Too bad he can't make him pretty.

772
01:17:57.970 --> 01:17:58.900
Where am I?

773
01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:00.531
In paradise.

774
01:18:01.232 --> 01:18:02.670
We'll take you to your maker.

775
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:26.016
Good evening, Mr. Toorop.

776
01:18:26.417 --> 01:18:29.170
I'm Dr. Darquandier, Aurora's father.

777
01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.450
Thought you were dead.

778
01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.800
It's sometimes useful to be dead.
It allows one a second chance.

779
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.580
You'll see.

780
01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:45.860
Oh, yes. You were clinically dead
for two hours.

781
01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.600
I fixed you up as best I could

782
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:51.400
We lost quite a bit of time
getting you from the morgue,

783
01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:53.570
and then you went into a coma
for five days.

784
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:58.290
Now, Mr. Toorop, I believe
I owe you some explanation.

785
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.721
You see, 20 years ago I was drummed
out of the medical profession.,

786
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:06.920
for trying to implant human babies
with artificial intelligence.

787
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:12.010
Around that time, the Noelites
came to me with an unusual offer.

788
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:16.382
They wanted me to do exactly what
the rest of the world was scared of, that is...

789
01:19:16.383 --> 01:19:18.310
to create a supernatural human being,

790
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:21.280
with the complete knowledge of
the world imprinted in her memory.

791
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.880
So I built a supercomputer,

792
01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.130
to be Aurora's artificial mother.

793
01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.339
As a fetus...

794
01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.000
Aurora learned to process information,

795
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.170
just like a computer.

796
01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.120
But when she was born,

797
01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.120
she became much more than
just an experiment.

798
01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.500
You see, she became...

799
01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.300
she became my daughter.

800
01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.491
She was beautiful, she was unique,

801
01:19:46.492 --> 01:19:48.460
and I couldn't bring myself
to give her away, so...

802
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:50.690
That's when they hired Gorsky
to kill me.

803
01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:52.025
Well,

804
01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:53.620
he almost succeeded.

805
01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.320
He took my baby away.

806
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.470
I searched for her for years.
I couldn't find her.

807
01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:03.580
I knew that one day the Noelites
would have to present their miracle,

808
01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.800
to the rest of the world.

809
01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:13.048
What do you want from me?

810
01:20:13.049 --> 01:20:14.450
I want you to find my daughter.

811
01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:17.600
We think she's alive and
that she planned everything.

812
01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.900
She even shot you with a purpose.

813
01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:21.326
You see,

814
01:20:21.727 --> 01:20:23.270
you died with your eyes open.

815
01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.420
But your brain recorded more
than you can actually remember.

816
01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:30.400
We just need to rewind the tape
and fiddle with your memory.

817
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:34.570
I was dead.

818
01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.340
Precisely.

819
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:45.430
People are starving
for any kind of miracle.

820
01:20:45.810 --> 01:20:49.250
We were the provider
and we had the copyright.

821
01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:52.006
250 million followers today.

822
01:20:52.307 --> 01:20:53.930
Two billion tomorrow.

823
01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.260
This is what Aurora represented.

824
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:59.160
Our stock options were sky high,

825
01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.030
and the whole world was
waiting for a revelation.

826
01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:03.741
But not anymore.

827
01:21:04.042 --> 01:21:06.040
Aurora was our trademark.

828
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.369
But now our trademark
has disappeared,

829
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:11.160
in a ball of fire like
a cheap magic trick!

830
01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:15.600
And you morons can't even find a
single D.N.A. string to rebuild her.

831
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.400
We are finally on the verge of
becoming a bona fide religion,

832
01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:23.870
and your incompetence has thrown 20
years of careful planning down the tubes.

833
01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.750
Who gave the order to use guns
to retrieve her?

834
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:28.599
You left Gorsky no choice!

835
01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.220
What were you thinking?

836
01:21:30.221 --> 01:21:31.585
Try not to get upset, Your Highness.

837
01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:33.190
It's bad for your blood pressure.

838
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:34.091
Stop fussing.

839
01:21:34.592 --> 01:21:35.392
Well?

840
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.490
Does anyone have any suggestions?

841
01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:41.380
What should we do?

842
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:45.546
Your Highness,

843
01:21:45.847 --> 01:21:47.160
we want to launch a campaign,

844
01:21:47.161 --> 01:21:50.210
to inform the people that we were
targets of a terrorist attack.

845
01:21:50.211 --> 01:21:52.010
We need to be proactive,
not victims!

846
01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:53.013
In six months,

847
01:21:53.314 --> 01:21:55.953
we can offer a closer look at God,

848
01:21:55.954 --> 01:21:57.380
through our new space module.

849
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:59.930
We need a miracle, not another gadget!

850
01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.040
What?

851
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:04.140
The body stolen from
the morgue was Toorop's.

852
01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:06.690
The police found the van that
transported him in New Jersey.

853
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:11.060
Who would want to abduct
the body of a dead man?

854
01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:19.010
What am I looking for?

855
01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.760
What you missed the first time.

856
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:23.850
We'll guide your memory
with our computer.

857
01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.050
Are you ready, Mr. Toorop?

858
01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.560
I hope so.

859
01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:44.323
Fast forward.

860
01:22:44.924 --> 01:22:46.000
Fast forward. Not too fast.

861
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.630
Those are his wars.
Don't bring him too far back.

862
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:57.299
We're losing control.

863
01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.000
He's going back too far.
Kill!

864
01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:00.833
That's his childhood.
Bring him back.

865
01:23:01.534 --> 01:23:02.534
Don't lead him there.

866
01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:05.760
Bring him forward.

867
01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.510
Not on the Noelites.
On the bikers. On the bikers.

868
01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.060
Alright.

869
01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.030
He's way past the danger threshold.

870
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:40.150
Everyone, slow down.

871
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:44.260
Slow down! Slow down!

872
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:51.540
Let's wait. Let's wait. Let's wait!

873
01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.300
<i>I need you to live.</i>

874
01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.020
He's dead.

875
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.004
Wait.

876
01:24:31.205 --> 01:24:32.250
Don't bring him back yet.

877
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:11.160
<i>Go home.</i>

878
01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:17.740
It's alright. It's alright, Toorop.

879
01:25:17.741 --> 01:25:18.840
You're back. You're safe.

880
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:23.342
Go home.

881
01:25:23.343 --> 01:25:24.750
What does it mean?

882
01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.400
How'd she survive the blast?

883
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:32.740
It's the babies, you see.

884
01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.720
They're gaining power.

885
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:37.210
They're the ones guiding her.

886
01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.135
Her capacity for survival
is greater than...

887
01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:43.120
anything we could ever
have imagined.

888
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:45.180
Survival of the fittest.

889
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:48.920
We're a pathetic race, really.

890
01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:51.760
We stopped evolving at a critical point.

891
01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:56.120
Machines have evolved infinitely
further in the past 200 years.

892
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.190
And that's what I tried
to correct with Aurora.

893
01:25:58.370 --> 01:26:00.420
Her babies are our future.

894
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.200
They are the real miracle.

895
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.780
You tried to correct mankind
by creating a Virgin Mary.

896
01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.394
The Noelites have found us.

897
01:26:11.395 --> 01:26:12.770
They'll be here in two minutes

898
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.157
Find my daughter.

899
01:26:16.258 --> 01:26:17.390
You're the only one now.

900
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.523
Mr. Gorsky.

901
01:26:21.824 --> 01:26:23.340
I hoped I wouldn't have
to see you again.

902
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.065
<i>Where is my money?</i>

903
01:26:25.066 --> 01:26:26.040
<i>You still haven't paid me.</i>

904
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:28.461
You have an odd way of killing people.

905
01:26:28.462 --> 01:26:29.910
What are you talking about?

906
01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.512
I'm on my way to see our old friend.

907
01:26:32.513 --> 01:26:33.370
Darquandier.

908
01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:36.380
<i>Impossible!</i>
I made his car explode myself.

909
01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.462
Mr. Gorsky, when I kill,

910
01:26:38.563 --> 01:26:39.620
I kill for good.

911
01:26:39.710 --> 01:26:40.751
Are you threatening me?

912
01:26:40.952 --> 01:26:41.960
Bless your soul.

913
01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.780
You need a nuke to kill me!

914
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:47.710
Bitch.

915
01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.170
Our satellites have spotted two
vehicles leaving the compound.

916
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:01.804
It's too late to intercept them.

917
01:27:02.105 --> 01:27:03.990
I'm sick and tired
of your damn excuses.

918
01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:39.957
Hello, my dear.

919
01:27:40.258 --> 01:27:41.410
It's lovely to see you.

920
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:43.001
Where's my daughter?

921
01:27:43.002 --> 01:27:44.510
I see you haven't found her.

922
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.090
And you never will.

923
01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:48.880
You selfish bastard.

924
01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:52.340
Twenty years ago I gave you
the opportunity you wanted.

925
01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.120
Now it's my moment.

926
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:57.909
Where is my daughter?

927
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:59.410
She's not your daughter.

928
01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.824
She comes from me!

929
01:28:00.825 --> 01:28:02.080
I designed her!

930
01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.160
For me!

931
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:05.395
She's my miracle!

932
01:28:06.296 --> 01:28:07.630
She belongs to my church!

933
01:28:07.710 --> 01:28:08.989
Your church is a lie!

934
01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:11.790
You're peddling miracles
for your own profit!

935
01:28:20.430 --> 01:28:22.770
Are you willing to die for her?

936
01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:23.770
Yes.

937
01:28:24.850 --> 01:28:25.680
Why?

938
01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.680
For a reason you will
never understand.

939
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.120
Love?

940
01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.420
I understand love.

941
01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:48.556
Find Toorop.

942
01:28:48.557 --> 01:28:49.700
He knows where she is.

943
01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:26.840
Wait here.

944
01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:05.340
Toorop.

945
01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.930
You're finally home.

946
01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:38.140
What's left of it.

947
01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:43.810
But I came back for you.

948
01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:48.950
Have a little faith.

Toorop.

Thank you...

962
01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:42.380
for protecting us.

963
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:14.270
You're their father now.

964

Aurora.

965
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:39.460
That's the first time
you've said my name.
