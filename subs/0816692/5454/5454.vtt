1
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:27,928
Guards! Royal salute! Present arms!

2
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:15,041
Some people are born
more fortunate than others.

3
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:17,435
Such was the case with me.

4
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:22,200
But as a child,
I was convinced of quite the opposite.

5
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:27,036
What little girl does not dream
of growing up as a princess?

6
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,717
But some palaces
are not at all what you'd think.

7
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:36,240
Even a palace... can be a prison.

8
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:44,832
Mama never explained why she
would have someone taste my food.

9
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:49,394
Why I couldn't attend school with
other children or read popular books.

10
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,833
When my father died,

11
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:02,674
Mama and her adviser,
Sir John Conroy, created rules.

12
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,594
He said they were for my protection,

13
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:08,956
and he called it the Kensington System.

14
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,270
I could not sleep in a room
without Mama

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,715
or even walk downstairs
without holding the hand of an adult.

16
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,108
I learned the reason for all this
when I was 11.

17
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:25,547
My uncle William
was the King of England.

18
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,666
Yet he and his three brothers
could boast only one living child.

19
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:34,233
And that was me.

20
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:37,276
Sir John's dream
was that the King would die

21
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,472
and there would be a Regency,

22
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:44,390
where my mother would rule England
and he would rule my mother.

23
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:48,834
So I began to dream of the day
when my life would change...

24
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,350
.. and I might be free.

25
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:55,348
And I prayed for the strength
to meet my destiny.

26
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:56,914
I will be good.

27
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:28,261
God save the Queen!

28
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:32,741
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!

29
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,629
Sign it!

30
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,303
Are you sure
that we're doing the right thing?

31
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,380
We've waited long enough.

32
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:56,141
Now, for the last time,
you will sign this order.

33
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:57,900
I will not sign it.

34
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,219
I say you will!

35
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,901
- I say I will not.
- How dare you, you...!

36
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:06,422
Sir John.

37
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,820
We were just...

38
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:12,217
It's time for the Princess's medicine.

39
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:15,977
- Shall I?
- I'll do it.

40
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,856
Well, if you're sure.

41
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:27,859
- Good night, mein liebling.
- Good night, Mama.

42
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:35,663
How are you?

43
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:51,177
I've received a letter from England.

44
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:55,653
My sister says Victoria won't sign
the order for her Regency.

45
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:57,618
And why would she sign it?

46
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:01,659
The Princess is nearly 18. Why
would she sign away her own powers?

47
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,175
Because she is an ignorant baby.

48
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:08,378
Because she needs guidance and time
to prepare for her role as Queen.

49
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,888
Until then, my sister
will take her place as Regent.

50
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,892
Sir John Conroy would be Regent.

51
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,607
Unfortunately, the Duchess
is controlled by her controller.

52
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,089
It may be in Your Majesty's interests
to abandon Conroy and your sister,

53
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:29,331
before it's too late,
and support the future Queen instead.

54
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,090
Of course, the Duchess won't like it.

55
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:37,330
Baron, I was born the younger son
of a penniless duke.

56
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,850
Now I'm King of the Belgians.

57
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:44,167
Such journeys are not managed
without hard decisions.

58
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:50,047
Besides,
who controls a young girl most?

59
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:53,445
Now go to Germany
and finish my nephew's training.

60
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,411
Albert!

61
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,363
I suppose you want
to walk with me this afternoon.

62
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:14,885
Really? Just the two of us alone?
What would Mama say?

63
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,729
Hold still
or I'll never get your nose right.

64
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:36,079
Oh, I give up!

65
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:41,641
I give up. You are impossible.
You are impossible. You are impossible.

66
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,926
Victoria, your mother's waiting.

67
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,760
Come on!

68
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,727
Dash!

69
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:14,958
- Where is the Duchess?
- In the drawing room, Your Highness.

70
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:25,718
It will take them three days
to arrive by coach from Coburg. Dashy!

71
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:29,034
- How did you come downstairs?
- I walked.

72
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:30,921
- Not alone?
- No, not alone.

73
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:33,279
- Lehzen was with me.
- She held your hand?

74
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:35,558
She did. Though why she still has to...

75
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:39,193
Because not everyone in England
wishes you well.

76
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:41,112
Put the book down, please.

77
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:52,274
Dashy!

78
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:55,159
England is the key to peace in Europe.

79
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:59,119
Your uncle's throne is six years old
and born of civil war.

80
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,274
He only took the crown of Belgium
because England pledged her support.

81
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:07,717
And if he's to survive, he must have
English force at his disposal.

82
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,392
Favourite novels?

83
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,346
- Sie hat nicht viele Romane gelesen.
- English. Always English.

84
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,235
She has not read many novels.
They were forbidden until last year.

85
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,388
- But she did like...?
- The Bride of Lammermoor.

86
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:25,672
- By?
- Sir Walter Scott.

87
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:29,227
- Other recreations?
- Drawing. The famous dolls, of course.

88
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:33,436
Piano. Music, generally. It's hard
to believe she knows so little Schubert.

89
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:35,950
Never mind Schubert.
She likes modern composers.

90
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:40,076
- Is she permitted the theatre?
- Only the opera and ballet.

91
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:42,350
Which opera does she like best?

92
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,705
- Norma?

93
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,592
I Puritani!

94
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:58,865
In order to maintain control
over Princess Victoria,

95
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:03,266
Sir John and the Duchess keep her
away from King William's court.

96
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:06,231
Thus when she does
make a public appearance,

97
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,704
her mere presence causes quite a stir.

98
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:30,580
You must win her favour
before anyone else has the chance.

99
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,700
You still don't look well.
Maybe we should go away for August.

100
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,508
- No, Mama.
- What do you mean, no?

101
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,785
We missed the Queen's birthday.
We will not miss the King's.

102
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:51,224
We've accepted. We're going.

103
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:56,302
Really, Victoria, don't issue
orders to me. I'm not a servant.

104
00:09:56,388 --> 00:10:00,141
Well, you've already disobeyed
about the extra rooms. That's enough.

105
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:03,588
Are we to live like rabbits,
crammed in a hutch?

106
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,103
We live in a palace, Mama.
We're a lot better off than most people.

107
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,700
The rooms which I took were empty.

108
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:13,495
Keeping us out of them
was... almost immoral.

109
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:17,383
- That's what John says.
- I knew he'd have a part in it.

110
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:23,462
My dearest child,
he only wants what's best for you.

111
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:25,614
I wish you could believe that.

112
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:32,620
I've invited the Coburg brothers
to come and stay.

113
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:35,854
- You ought to know them better.
- Why?

114
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:37,934
Because you should.

115
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:43,735
- Uncle Leopold thinks it's a good idea.

116
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:51,020
You stick one more pin in me,
I swear I will call the guard.

117
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:57,691
Your first visit is the most important.
We can not have any mistakes.

118
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,376
And always remember,
you're first a Coburg.

119
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,015
The King of the Belgians is a Coburg.
The King of Portugal is a Coburg,

120
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:13,457
so is the Queen of England's mother.
And you are the next piece in the game!

121
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,006
Now go to England and make her smile.

122
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,605
Is this all the luggage?

123
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:25,896
- What if she wants to dance?
- It's your first visit. She won't.

124
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:39,528
- Your Serene Highnesses, welcome.
- Thank you.

125
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:44,008
I'm Sir John Conroy, controller of the
Duchess's household. This way, please.

126
00:11:58,214 --> 00:12:00,092
The Duchess is in the drawing room.

127
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:11,042
- Ah! May I present her Royal...
- Hello.

128
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:18,160
I'm Ernst, ma'am.
This is my brother, Albert.

129
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:27,364
- We haven't interrupt your studies?
- No, not at all.

130
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,761
- How was your journey?
- Long, but not too bad.

131
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,442
We had books to keep us busy.

132
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,409
As matter of fact, I passed the time
reading The Bride of Lammermoor.

133
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,082
By Sir Walter... Scott.

134
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,962
Yes.

135
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,206
Do you want to come and meet Mama?

136
00:13:05,007 --> 00:13:09,124
Of the modern composers, I suppose
Vincenzo Bellini is my favourite.

137
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,881
What a coincidence! So is mine.
Which of his operas do you enjoy most?

138
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:17,721
- No, wait, let me guess. I Puritani?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

139
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:21,434
I used to like it too.
Now I prefer Norma.

140
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:26,795
Dashy! Go fetch it! Fetch it, Dash!

141
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:30,477
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

142
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:38,316
- Have I offended you in some way?
- No.

143
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:45,873
And Schubert.

144
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,954
I like Schubert.

145
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:54,479
I think...
I think perhaps you don't,... but I do.

146
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,391
I don't mind Schubert.

147
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,393
Good.

148
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:31,869
Do you ever feel like
a chess piece yourself?

149
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:35,428
In a game being played
against your will?

150
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:38,713
- Do you?
- Constantly.

151
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:42,710
I see them leaning in
and moving me around the board.

152
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:45,833
The Duchess and Sir John?

153
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,624
Not just them. Uncle Leopold.

154
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:54,152
The King. I'm sure half the politicians
are ready to seize hold of my skirts

155
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:58,022
and drag me from square to square.

156
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:06,865
Then master the rules of the game
until you play it better than they can.

157
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:13,581
You don't recommend I find a husband
to play it for me?

158
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:17,983
I should find one to play it with you,
not for you.

159
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:25,190
Why don't we ring for some music?
And then we could dance.

160
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:29,345
I've recently discovered the waltz
and I am quite in love with it.

161
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:36,668
- Waltzing is not really my forte.
- Oh, dear.

162
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,144
What a shame.

163
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,259
You know the King wants me to marry
my cousin George?

164
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:52,981
Hmm.

165
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,978
What's he like at chess?

166
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:12,497
Victoria.

167
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:16,505
It's alright, Lehzen,
Albert can take me up.

168
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:19,782
You'll have to hold my hand.
Mama insists. I hope you don't mind.

169
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:21,663
Not in the least.

170
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,934
What did you want to say?

171
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:38,534
Only that I understand more
than you think of what your life is.

172
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,056
Do you?

173
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:43,531
My childhood wasn't easy either.
I lost my mother when I was a boy.

174
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:45,977
- I know. She died.
- No, er...

175
00:16:46,062 --> 00:16:49,336
That is, she did die eventually, but...

176
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,458
she was sent away long before that.

177
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,008
There was some difficulty.

178
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,491
It was all hushed up
and... no one talks of it now.

179
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:03,971
But I know what it is to live
alone inside your head,

180
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,256
while never giving a clue
as to your real feelings.

181
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:11,932
Did Uncle Leopold
ask you to tell me that?

182
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:15,250
No. Er, he actually told me
never to mention it.

183
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,570
Well, how little he knows me.

184
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:22,171
Hmm.

185
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,327
May I write to you?

186
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:18,483
You'll miss the princes
when they're gone, ma'am.

187
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:20,324
Don't be impertinent.

188
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:25,850
- Those boys pester you.
- Oh, please, Lehzen.

189
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:30,525
You don't think I've come this far
to walk into another jail, do you?

190
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,882
- You must marry one day.
- Well, I don't see why.

191
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,006
And if I do, I shall please myself,

192
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,844
not Mama or Uncle Leopold or the King
or anyone else. Trust me.

193
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:02,599
- Must I?
- Yes, you must.

194
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,157
Be on your guard.

195
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:06,806
We are going to Windsor
for my uncle's birthday party.

196
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:09,845
- In the castle of the enemy.
- Your enemy, Sir John, not mine.

197
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:12,918
- Agree to nothing.
- What should I say about the rooms?

198
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:16,682
You needed the space.
Appeal to the Queen. It's ridiculous.

199
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:19,757
I wish you were coming with us.

200
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:31,679
You're very intent, Baroness.
Are you making a study of me?

201
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:33,197
Someone should.

202
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,311
- Present Prime Minister?
- Melbourne.

203
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:46,394
Lord Melbourne.

204
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:50,998
The Liberal leader who'll probably be
in power when the Princess succeeds.

205
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:53,754
- He may be troublesome.
- Why?

206
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:57,232
He puts the interests of England
above those of Europe.

207
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:01,314
- Which is bad?
- Which is not useful to us.

208
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:05,996
He wouldn't spill one drop of
English blood to save a foreign throne.

209
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,435
The Viscount Melbourne.

210
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,873
Why would he save a foreign throne
if it wasn't in England's interest?

211
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,157
That is just the kind of thinking
your Uncle Leopold is afraid of.

212
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:29,026
Which is why he's content to find his
niece is the future Queen of England.

213
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:31,187
The Duke of Wellington.

214
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:35,792
in the public mind, the leader of the
Conservative opposition is a pet hero,

215
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:38,675
Napoleon's conqueror,
the grand old Duke of Wellington.

216
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:41,189
- But not in fact.
- No.

217
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:44,074
- You look in very good health, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

218
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:47,909
- I wish I was. Enjoy the meal.
- Thank you.

219
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:51,873
The next Tory Prime Minister
will be Sir Robert Peel.

220
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,706
.. and Lady Peel.

221
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:59,634
Which side does Victoria favour?

222
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:04,833
She's a Liberal. Above all,
she favours Lord Melbourne.

223
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:07,587
And he'll take full advantage of it.

224
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:12,304
Her Royal Highness,
Princess Victoria of Kent.

225
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,826
Her Royal Highness,
the Duchess of Kent.

226
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,901
The Lady Flora Hastings.

227
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:32,699
- Hello, Uncle.
- Look at that demure little head.

228
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,066
And all of us
wondering what's inside it.

229
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,061
We'll find out soon enough.

230
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,939
Lord Melbourne will make her fall
in love with him. It's his method.

231
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,868
- Don't underestimate Victoria.
- Don't underestimate Melbourne.

232
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:51,902
My dearest niece.

233
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:55,948
- Won't you greet your cousin George?
- Good evening, George.

234
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,337
How can my niece and nephew have
grown up so when I wasn't looking?

235
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:02,864
Whereas you are quite unchanged
and as handsome as ever.

236
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:06,985
If I put my head very close to yours
and speak softly,

237
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,374
- they'll think we're hatching a plot.
- Yes.

238
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,535
If I look a little surprised,...

239
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,096
- well, then they'll know it.

240
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:21,419
I wish we saw more of you. But then,
nor you nor I are to blame for that.

241
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:25,498
The plain fact is, madam,
you have stolen 17 rooms!

242
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:32,014
One cannot steal a room, sir.
The rooms are where you left them.

243
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:34,697
Now they are used,
before they were empty.

244
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:37,742
I see. So I have no say
in my own palaces?

245
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,815
Why not move in here
and bring your Irish tinker with you?

246
00:22:40,903 --> 00:22:43,861
The Queen and I
will be happy enough in the lodge!

247
00:22:43,943 --> 00:22:49,222
So would I be, sir, if I thought that
people there would be polite to me!

248
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:52,179
- How dare you talk...!
- Enough!

249
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:55,973
You have exhausted the topic.

250
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,973
Conroy tried to force the Princess
Victoria's agreement to a Regency.

251
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,770
She wouldn't sign it, sick as she was.
That says something for her spirit.

252
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,775
Your next birthday
will be quite a landmark.

253
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:31,533
- I hope we'll see more of you at Court.
- I hope so too, Lord Melbourne.

254
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:39,215
You know,
should you ever need an ally,...

255
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:41,686
you have one in me.

256
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:45,165
The Prime Minister
has more important calls upon his time.

257
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:47,565
Not at all.
I knew the late Duke of Kent.

258
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:49,932
Naturally,
I take an interest in his daughter.

259
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:54,247
- You knew my father?
- Yes.

260
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:57,211
I'm sorry.
Is it difficult to speak of him?

261
00:23:57,293 --> 00:24:02,049
No. I love to hear from someone who
knew him. For I never did, you see.

262
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:07,891
Well,... he was a great gentleman.
Of that you can be sure.

263
00:24:07,974 --> 00:24:09,405
Indeed I am.

264
00:24:09,492 --> 00:24:14,281
Excellent company like his brother, the
Regent, but not quite so extravagant.

265
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:22,608
And kind, like his brother, the King,...
but perhaps not so talkative.

266
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:27,728
Well, you make him sound
as though he were the best of them.

267
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,371
Oh, I think so, ma'am.

268
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:33,765
Your leader is hard at work, Duchess.

269
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,798
You see him hover with his net
to catch the pretty butterfly.

270
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,123
And when your party is back in power,
Duke, will you not do the same?

271
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:46,803
Not nearly as well as Melbourne.

272
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:51,359
Unfortunately, I have no small talk.
Peel has no manners.

273
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:55,877
And I would have a hard time
praising her father.

274
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:59,244
The most brutal officer
I ever encountered.

275
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:51,512
I thank you
for your good wishes on my birthday.

276
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:56,715
It has been a long life...
and an interesting one.

277
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:02,630
But I shall be content
with only a short while more.

278
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,512
Just enough... to dispense
with any thought of a Regency,...

279
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:18,235
.. so that I may pass the Royal
Authority directly to that young lady.

280
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:25,546
And not... to the hands...
of a person now near me...

281
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:30,628
.. who is surrounded by evil advisers

282
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:36,314
and who cannot act with propriety in
the station in which she's been placed!

283
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,149
I have been insulted!

284
00:26:40,236 --> 00:26:43,750
Grossly and continually insulted!

285
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:50,832
She has kept her daughter,
my brother's child, from my Court!

286
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:56,147
But from now on,
I'd have her know that I am King!

287
00:26:56,234 --> 00:27:00,023
And I will not be flouted
or disobeyed by her

288
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:03,709
or by that jackanapes
she keeps about her!

289
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:13,348
Are you alright?

290
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:19,584
Families, who'd be without them?

291
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:04,024
Are you listening?

292
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,378
What?

293
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:21,057
- Well?
- Ma'am, you do have a letter,

294
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:24,180
but it's not from Germany,
it's from the King.

295
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:28,783
So it is. Thank you, Watson.

296
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:39,178
- Don't you see what he wants?
- He increases my income

297
00:28:39,262 --> 00:28:43,220
once I'm 18 and he asks to see me
at Court, what is wrong with that?

298
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:47,897
The King wants to separate you from
your mother. He wants to control you,

299
00:28:47,981 --> 00:28:51,098
to take you from those whose sole aim
is trying to protect you!

300
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:54,490
No need to shout. The people
will find out our business soon enough

301
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,812
without hearing it from your lips.

302
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:01,176
Tell her. Make her understand.

303
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,058
What Sir John means is that you're
unprepared for the task ahead of you.

304
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,050
And if I am, whose fault is that?

305
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:10,938
You're too young! You've no experience!

306
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,817
You're like a china doll
walking over a precipice!

307
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:17,731
Well, then, I must smash!
For it's too late to mend my ways now!

308
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:21,254
- So if you'll excuse me...
- But I will not excuse you!

309
00:29:21,338 --> 00:29:24,294
Now this is what you will do!

310
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:28,529
First, you will refuse the money and
demand that it be given to your mother.

311
00:29:28,618 --> 00:29:32,929
Next, you will appoint me
your private secretary from today.

312
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:35,893
Finally, you will agree
to be co-regent with the Duchess

313
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:40,492
until your 25th birthday.
Neither she nor I will accept less!

314
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:43,533
You may do
what you like with the money.

315
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,050
Now, get out of my way!

316
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:55,250
And if you think that I will ever forget

317
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:58,805
that you just stood by silent
and you watched him treat me thus,

318
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:00,884
you are dreaming!

319
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:24,528
is there no limit
to this disobedience?

320
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,320
Mark my words!
The reign of King Conroy is coming!

321
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:32,801
My poor sister-in-law. What is the hold
that wicked man has over her?

322
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,725
What about her uncle in Brussels?
Could he not be of assistance?

323
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:42,280
King Leopold is as slippery
as a barrel full of eels.

324
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:46,568
If he did dislodge Conroy, it'd only be
to tighten his own grip on the girl.

325
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:52,002
Mightn't there be some benefit
if I pay Princess Victoria a visit

326
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:55,876
before Conroy
has a chance to usurp her?

327
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:59,004
Very well.

328
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:05,521
Lord, in your mercy, get me past May!

329
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:11,794
That way she'll be of age and we'll
have killed off the Regency at least.

330
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:18,082
I tell you, Lord Melbourne,
his behaviour to me

331
00:31:18,164 --> 00:31:22,395
makes it impossible to keep him
in any post near my person.

332
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:24,873
Any post whatever.

333
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:29,354
You don't think it more dangerous
to cut him loose?

334
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:33,801
I know things that mean
I could never have confidence in him.

335
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:36,397
Now, I see I must endure Lady Flora.

336
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:39,317
Mama cannot appear at Court
without a lady-in-waiting,

337
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:41,393
but I draw the line at Conroy.

338
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,714
And once I'm Queen, I do not wish
to look upon his face again.

339
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,757
Well, we can't prevent the Duchess

340
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:49,197
from keeping him
in charge of her own affairs.

341
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,273
That will be her mistake, not mine.

342
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,791
My dear Victoria, when I think...

343
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,235
Dearest Victoria,
if ever you should need...

344
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:18,917
What? Like a vulture? To hover
at the edge until the King is dead?

345
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:23,229
And, ma'am, you needn't worry.

346
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:26,993
I'll be your private secretary.
For now, at least.

347
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,910
Thank you, Lord Melbourne.
That is a great comfort to me.

348
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:34,194
- Wenn er tot ist, dann gibt es mehr...
- Ernst! English, please!

349
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:38,429
When he is dead, there'll be more
than one vulture to contend with.

350
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:41,633
We should consider
the new appointments.

351
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:44,184
Your ladies-in-waiting and so forth.

352
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:48,268
Perhaps the Duchess of Sutherland
for Mistress of the Robes?

353
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:49,994
Oh, I don't really know her.

354
00:32:50,076 --> 00:32:53,464
Ma'am, she's a dear friend of mine.
You'll enjoy her enormously.

355
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,626
I should be lost without your guidance.

356
00:32:56,714 --> 00:33:00,592
- I hope you know how grateful I am.
- I'll draw up a list.

357
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:02,790
What is it? Don't you like her?

358
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:05,592
Yes, I like her.

359
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:07,550
More than I dared hope.

360
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:11,705
But it's not up to me, is it.
What do you call a man

361
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:15,386
who waits for a rich woman to decide
whether or not she wants him?

362
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:28,660
- Then, why not tell her how you feel?

363
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,865
My dear Victoria,

364
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:42,228
these days will be full of sadness
since I know the King is dear to you.

365
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:46,985
Will you allow me to offer my support,
albeit at a distance?

366
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,581
If I cannot be with you,

367
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:53,183
then I pray you will hear my voice
in the music that I send.

368
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,987
You know my love of Schubert.

369
00:33:56,068 --> 00:34:02,098
This is his "Swan Song".
And I play it with you in my heart.

370
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:07,580
- Is he ready?
- Well, he may be, but she isn't.

371
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:13,418
Let her enjoy succession
and the freedom it'll bring.

372
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:19,456
We must wait for disillusion,
and the loneliness that follows.

373
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:42,093
Victoria.

374
00:34:47,022 --> 00:34:49,013
You must come now.

375
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:10,814
Long live the Queen.

376
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:29,412
I'm going back to bed.

377
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:32,375
I imagine Lord Melbourne
will be here quite early.

378
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:37,690
Make sure he has everything he needs
if I am not ready to receive him.

379
00:35:37,777 --> 00:35:39,766
Of course, Your Royal...

380
00:35:41,296 --> 00:35:43,287
Your Majesty.

381
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:53,972
Victoria, wait. I will hold your hand.

382
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:55,727
No. Thank you, Mama.

383
00:35:55,815 --> 00:35:58,726
And, Lehzen, in the morning,
arrange for my bed to be moved

384
00:35:58,814 --> 00:36:00,407
into a room of my own?

385
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:03,769
- Surely there's no need...
- As soon as possible, Lehzen.

386
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:34,527
The Council is assembled,
Your Majesty.

387
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:01,956
Her Majesty the Queen!

388
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:33,398
It is with a sense
of reverence and honour

389
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:36,396
that I address you,
my Privy Councillors,

390
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:39,122
as your Sovereign and Queen.

391
00:37:41,203 --> 00:37:45,798
I mourn sincerely the death
of my dear uncle, the King,

392
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:51,673
but I know I may count on you to serve
me as loyally as you served him.

393
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:04,600
I am young, but I am willing to learn.

394
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:08,593
And I mean to devote my life
to the service of my country

395
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,149
and my people.

396
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:14,151
I look for your help in this.

397
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,470
I know I shall not be disappointed.

398
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,355
Thank you.

399
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:28,391
She starts on your watch,
Lord Melbourne.

400
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:31,549
Guard her well
and keep her safe from harm.

401
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:56,423
As a matter of interest, will a time
come when I read them first?

402
00:38:56,514 --> 00:39:00,665
You'll enjoy this.
She has a real flair for description.

403
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:02,746
Present arms!

404
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:07,789
Dearest Albert, on Tuesday,
I went to inspect Buckingham Palace.

405
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:12,899
It is only just finished and I shall be
the very first sovereign to live there.

406
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,542
As I stepped out of the carriage,

407
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:23,182
for the first time in my life,
I felt freedom.

408
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:32,908
- Splendid, is it not?
- Yes!

409
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,582
You'll have to decide
on a husband soon.

410
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,341
What about Leopold's candidate?

411
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:41,739
I can't marry the man
they want me to marry.

412
00:39:41,828 --> 00:39:43,580
Oh!

413
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:47,662
Every suitor
will come with strings attached.

414
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:52,299
Can't I be my own mistress for a while?
Haven't I earned it?

415
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:56,141
Dear Lord M, he's so very kind. I
couldn't have asked for a better tutor.

416
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,459
You may dream of independence,
but you won't get it.

417
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:03,460
From now on, everyone will push you
and pull you for their own advantage.

418
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:06,264
Melbourne more than the rest.

419
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:10,339
Just remember, you are the Queen,
he's a politician.

420
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:14,464
And politicians, whatever their creed,
always resent a monarchy.

421
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,661
They pass through. You stay.

422
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:22,216
So just keep "dear Lord M"
in his proper sphere.

423
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:25,340
He's already chosen the new household.

424
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,858
About my ladies-in-waiting...

425
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:32,653
Yes, I'll have a list brought
over later. They've all accepted.

426
00:40:32,743 --> 00:40:36,974
Only my aunt advised me not to be,
well, too partisan in my choice.

427
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,418
With respect, Your Majesty,

428
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:43,654
I think I understand these things at
least as well as the Queen Dowager.

429
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,095
I know that, of course.

430
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:49,220
And we want our friends around us,
of course, surely,

431
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,497
as we begin our labours.

432
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:55,938
We don't want to find Sir John Conroy
sneaking his feet back under the table.

433
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:59,217
No. Not if we have to line up
every friend we both possess.

434
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:04,090
Well, quite, ma'am. It's very cold
in here. Why haven't they lit the fires?

435
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,489
It seems the fires are laid
by the Lord Steward's department,

436
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:09,331
but lit by the Lord Chamberlain's,

437
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:14,128
and no one knows which footmen
should do it. It's not very sensible.

438
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:17,527
Well, if that's the way things are done,
I shouldn't meddle.

439
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:20,212
We must improve where we can.

440
00:41:21,298 --> 00:41:23,891
If I've discovered anything
from touring England,

441
00:41:23,977 --> 00:41:26,172
it's the suffering that needs my help.

442
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:28,169
Never try to do good, Your Majesty.

443
00:41:28,258 --> 00:41:30,770
- It always leads to terrible scrapes.

444
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:34,566
Lord Melbourne, that is not
what is preached from the pulpit.

445
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:36,567
No. That's why I never go to church.

446
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:39,217
One always hears
the most extraordinary things.

447
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:54,764
I've made no promise to him.

448
00:41:56,494 --> 00:41:59,769
But sometimes I feel
quite alone in the world.

449
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:03,050
Never while I'm here, Your Majesty.

450
00:42:06,532 --> 00:42:09,650
Lord Melbourne is akin to a miracle.

451
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:12,405
He has proved to be most generous
and sensitive,

452
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:15,564
quite wondrous in a politician,

453
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:17,881
someone I trust and hold dear.

454
00:42:17,971 --> 00:42:21,521
- He is the best company imaginable.

455
00:42:21,612 --> 00:42:25,809
Sometimes we laugh so much,
it's as if we were naughty children.

456
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:31,288
Oh, Albert, I so look forward to the day
when you can know and value him

457
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,248
as I do.

458
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:38,483
Yours affectionately, Victoria.

459
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:46,845
Plenty of praise for Lord Melbourne
and not much of anything else.

460
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:52,797
- Everything comes to he who waits.
- And if nothing comes, what then?

461
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:55,765
You've played with me, Baron.

462
00:42:55,847 --> 00:42:58,997
And now it is enough.
I'm going back to England.

463
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:02,079
There must be a reason
if you wish to visit Her Majesty.

464
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:04,964
Then find me a reason.

465
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:07,997
ich will diesen...

466
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:13,125
So, are you going to propose?

467
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:19,873
What? What am I supposed to think?
You're going to enjoy the weather?

468
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:22,558
I'm going to spend some time with her,
that's all.

469
00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:27,640
Besides, I am forbidden.

470
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:30,443
It has to come from her, apparently.

471
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:35,074
So I could not propose,
even if I wanted to.

472
00:43:36,163 --> 00:43:37,995
And do you want to?

473
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,110
Walk on! Hup, hup!

474
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,989
Please hold still. I'm afraid
I always find noses a challenge.

475
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:12,939
Am I permitted to talk?

476
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,411
Yes, but you can't move.

477
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:26,964
There's nothing to rival
an English garden.

478
00:44:27,046 --> 00:44:30,919
Of all my life in Kensington,
it's the only part I'll miss.

479
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,509
But the gardens at Buckingham Palace,
surely...

480
00:44:33,595 --> 00:44:36,503
- You're moving!
- Oh.

481
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,977
Now you're smiling.

482
00:44:40,904 --> 00:44:45,970
Impossible!
You're worst than him!

483
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:54,204
I believe we have a duty
to those in need of our protection.

484
00:44:54,286 --> 00:44:56,160
It is the business of every sovereign

485
00:44:56,243 --> 00:44:59,866
to champion the dispossessed,
for no one else will.

486
00:44:59,957 --> 00:45:03,228
Take housing. May I show you?

487
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:07,139
Industry is expanding so fast

488
00:45:07,228 --> 00:45:11,294
that people are not considering
where the workers will live.

489
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:14,734
But I've been experimenting.
By building these in units of two,

490
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:20,805
you can build safe, clean homes for
two families for less than the cost...

491
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:23,681
I'm sorry. I don't mean to preach.

492
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:26,909
No, there's no need to apologise
for being passionate.

493
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:31,262
It seems I have a lot to learn.

494
00:45:33,268 --> 00:45:35,064
With all my duties and...

495
00:45:35,147 --> 00:45:38,849
- And I do take them very seriously.
- I know you do.

496
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,293
But plenty of people
will expect me to fail.

497
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:44,048
And there are even more
trying to take advantage

498
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:46,803
of my youth and inexperience.

499
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:49,799
Then, they don't know you like I do.

500
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:55,196
May I keep this?

501
00:46:07,702 --> 00:46:11,086
So, remember, the first thing
is to find an anchor point.

502
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:14,324
So, take your hand back
to beneath your chin.

503
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:16,876
Good. This is where
it will come every time.

504
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:19,195
Now, release the bow.

505
00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:21,590
Your hand must cover the leather,
like this.

506
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:24,112
And make a firm claw.
One finger, two fingers.

507
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,979
- Claw.
- Yes, and back to beneath the chin.

508
00:46:28,071 --> 00:46:32,421
Bend this arm slightly.
Rotate to catch the arrow.

509
00:46:32,504 --> 00:46:33,981
Good.

510
00:46:34,062 --> 00:46:37,210
Very good. Now, try with an arrow.

511
00:46:47,444 --> 00:46:50,987
- Ah. He's still here?
- At my mother's insistence.

512
00:46:51,078 --> 00:46:52,986
Certainly not mine.

513
00:46:55,114 --> 00:46:56,940
Where am I to live?

514
00:46:57,029 --> 00:46:59,745
Am I to be abandoned here?

515
00:46:59,826 --> 00:47:02,017
Or am I to beg along the highways
for a crust?

516
00:47:02,102 --> 00:47:05,886
Come now. You will move
into the palace with the Queen.

517
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:08,885
But she's arranged
a separate apartment for you.

518
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:11,086
It will allow you both more privacy.

519
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:15,316
I... I don't want privacy
from my own child!

520
00:47:15,404 --> 00:47:18,597
To exclude us will launch
the new reign in a cloud of scandal.

521
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,347
I know your game, my lord.

522
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:25,944
You want to be her father, her mother,
and who knows what else.

523
00:47:27,466 --> 00:47:29,977
If I'm not to be her private secretary,
then what?

524
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:34,572
I'm sorry. I can see
that I am not speaking clearly.

525
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:39,081
You have played the game and lost.

526
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:46,196
The Prime Minister is here,
Your Majesty.

527
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,313
Thank you, Duchess.

528
00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:52,110
Have I thanked you properly
for accepting the post?

529
00:47:52,191 --> 00:47:54,782
It will involve
a good deal of inconvenience.

530
00:47:54,868 --> 00:47:57,457
To be Mistress of the Robes
is a great honour.

531
00:47:57,543 --> 00:47:59,612
I'm only anxious to prove worthy of it.

532
00:47:59,702 --> 00:48:02,131
My Lord Melbourne
thinks you'll be perfect.

533
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:12,234
How is Albert's visit going?

534
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:17,106
He writes Victoria is under
Melbourne's control. He's frustrated.

535
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:18,786
Then he must stay in England

536
00:48:18,874 --> 00:48:22,577
until the Queen thinks more of him
than she does of Melbourne.

537
00:48:22,668 --> 00:48:25,654
Queen Elizabeth never married.

538
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:27,776
It didn't spoil things for her.

539
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:32,131
Are you familiar with the Coronation
Chair and the ancient Stone of Scone?

540
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:36,600
Familiar, yes,... but quite in awe.

541
00:48:36,689 --> 00:48:42,516
I'm terribly afraid of disappointing
on a day I so want to do it perfectly.

542
00:48:45,195 --> 00:48:49,580
Just be yourself. Your instincts
are always to your credit.

543
00:48:54,703 --> 00:48:57,770
I'm sorry. They're preparing
the Abbey for the ceremony.

544
00:48:57,857 --> 00:49:01,844
I'm told they asked permission
for a glimpse of Your Majesty.

545
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:06,364
- Don't be sorry.
- God bless, Your Majesty.

546
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:11,787
I do want to help them,
whatever you say.

547
00:49:11,878 --> 00:49:15,660
And not just the labouring poor,
but the hungry and the homeless.

548
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:19,620
There are people who are lost. Whose
business is it to see to their welfare?

549
00:49:19,705 --> 00:49:24,648
Well, in my experience, it's best
to let these things develop naturally.

550
00:49:24,738 --> 00:49:27,409
If you interfere,
you risk overturning the cart.

551
00:49:27,495 --> 00:49:32,084
Prince Albert doesn't agree. He's made
a study of the working man's condition.

552
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:35,042
He's full to the brim
with ideas for their improvement.

553
00:49:35,124 --> 00:49:38,827
Is he indeed? How inspiring.

554
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:41,271
Well, good. He sounds like a young man

555
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:43,865
ready to take charge
at the first opportunity.

556
00:49:54,296 --> 00:49:56,807
Then, you had better master
the rules of the game

557
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,279
until you play it better than they can.

558
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:15,297
Are you quite sure about that, ma'am?

559
00:50:17,863 --> 00:50:19,372
Make your move.

560
00:50:38,393 --> 00:50:40,382
Well?

561
00:50:47,142 --> 00:50:52,334
You may not accompany me
to the Proclamation Ceremony.

562
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:57,677
You may not attend the Coronation.

563
00:51:11,267 --> 00:51:13,617
Perfect.

564
00:51:18,615 --> 00:51:23,362
- You're unprepared.
- No experience! Too young!

565
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,118
Then, they don't know you like I do.

566
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:08,542
Don't look so surprised.
The Queen has many different duties.

567
00:52:08,624 --> 00:52:13,055
It's heartening to see she won't
neglect them, even on Coronation Day.

568
00:52:13,138 --> 00:52:17,044
- I don't think Dash would allow it.
- Try to get some rest before the ball.

569
00:52:17,131 --> 00:52:21,358
I will. Since I firmly intend
to dance until dawn.

570
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,295
Her Majesty the Queen.

571
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:07,957
Are you sure this is wise?

572
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,733
It's been quite a day. Are you tired?

573
00:54:54,816 --> 00:54:57,689
Oh, no.
Ah, well, not really. It's just...

574
00:54:57,771 --> 00:54:59,918
Well, I'm stronger than I look.

575
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:04,312
- How much longer are you in London?
- Only until Friday.

576
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:08,152
Then home via Brussels.
Uncle Leopold must have his report.

577
00:55:11,832 --> 00:55:15,182
Oh, dear. I have a quadrille
with the Prince of Prussia next.

578
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:18,891
My poor little toes.
I feel sorry for them already.

579
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:22,088
Your Majesty.

580
00:55:42,188 --> 00:55:44,936
I've had a letter from King Leopold.

581
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:48,455
He proposes
extending this visit of Prince Albert.

582
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:51,924
- And what have you answered?
- Nothing yet.

583
00:55:52,812 --> 00:55:55,324
Well, perhaps you should tell your uncle

584
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:58,317
you need to focus
on your new duties right now.

585
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,141
Thank you for being my messenger.

586
00:56:11,227 --> 00:56:14,657
I hope I've given my uncle enough
detail. Fill in anything I've missed.

587
00:56:14,741 --> 00:56:18,775
- He takes a great interest in you.
- Yes, don't I know it.

588
00:56:18,856 --> 00:56:22,240
You should see the questions
he asks by every letter.

589
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,478
- Like a never-ending examination.

590
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:29,031
Lord Melbourne calls him this...

591
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:32,108
What about Lord Melbourne?

592
00:56:33,753 --> 00:56:34,946
Nothing.

593
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:41,371
- The French Ambassador is here.
- Right. Erm...

594
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:44,568
I wish you a good journey.

595
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:53,476
Victoria?

596
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:58,557
I would so like to be useful to you.

597
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:01,746
If there is ever an opportunity.

598
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:04,026
I know you would.

599
00:57:05,709 --> 00:57:07,980
But not yet.

600
00:57:42,097 --> 00:57:44,526
- Have you read this?

601
00:57:44,612 --> 00:57:46,602
No, sir.

602
00:57:49,645 --> 00:57:52,202
It seems
she does not think it appropriate

603
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:56,235
to discuss politics in our otherwise
"delightful correspondence".

604
00:57:56,316 --> 00:57:59,907
- Which was dictated by Melbourne.
- Damn it!

605
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:03,020
Do something!

606
00:58:03,107 --> 00:58:05,174
I can't get past Melbourne.

607
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:10,694
Then get him past Melbourne!
Get him into her bed!

608
00:58:10,776 --> 00:58:14,001
My dear Victoria,
Uncle Leopold is full of ideas

609
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,920
of how you and I may spend
more time together.

610
00:58:17,007 --> 00:58:21,232
And I must say I hope that some
of them, at least, will come to pass.

611
00:58:38,296 --> 00:58:41,330
Dear Albert,
you've been keeping secrets.

612
00:58:41,413 --> 00:58:44,559
When did you learn
to dance so beautifully?

613
00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:47,716
Lord M assures me
the next several months

614
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:51,473
will be particularly gruelling
and busy for me as a new Queen.

615
00:58:51,558 --> 00:58:55,544
Thus, I am not certain
when I shall see you again.

616
00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:00,058
I look forward to your every letter,

617
00:59:00,147 --> 00:59:04,371
enjoying the detail of life in Germany,
and wishing to share more.

618
00:59:06,774 --> 00:59:09,843
- Waterloo might not...
- Yours affectionately, Victoria.

619
00:59:09,931 --> 00:59:14,157
Ah, this quite inoffensive little game
can turn into an effective weapon!

620
00:59:16,602 --> 00:59:19,633
Lord Melbourne says
French doctors kill their patients.

621
00:59:19,716 --> 00:59:23,103
- English ones just let them die.

622
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:24,941
I thought he might be here tonight.

623
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:27,586
He's thrown me over
for Lady Holland.

624
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:31,858
- I expect Your Majesty will miss him.
- Not too severely. He's back tomorrow.

625
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,576
No, no, no.
I meant when he's out of power.

626
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:36,768
What?

627
00:59:37,691 --> 00:59:42,553
Well, only, I don't wish to crow, but...
I thought it was common knowledge

628
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:45,632
that he's about to lose the vote.

629
00:59:52,991 --> 00:59:56,021
Schatzi?
I thought you were in your bedroom.

630
01:00:15,957 --> 01:00:17,547
Never mind.

631
01:00:17,635 --> 01:00:22,225
- Shh. Shh.

632
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:25,215
- You won't desert me, will you?
- Never.

633
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:27,337
Mein liebes Schatzi.

634
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:37,281
Every one of your ladies is the wife
of a friend of Lord Melbourne.

635
01:00:37,365 --> 01:00:39,195
Surely you can see how that looks?

636
01:00:39,284 --> 01:00:42,315
You should not set such store
by appearances, Sir Robert.

637
01:00:42,398 --> 01:00:46,545
I only ask for a token. For two ladies,
even one, who supports my cause.

638
01:00:46,633 --> 01:00:50,619
Otherwise, it must seem as if
Palace and Parliament have fallen out.

639
01:00:50,706 --> 01:00:53,137
- I want to go in.
- I beg your pardon, ma'am.

640
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:57,210
Her Majesty is with the Prime Minister
and cannot be disturbed.

641
01:00:57,297 --> 01:00:59,488
But that will not apply to her mother.

642
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,959
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

643
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:04,639
Let me understand you.

644
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:08,270
Are you saying it is the Prime Minister
who selects my household?

645
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:11,236
- Has the law changed in this regard?
- No, of course not.

646
01:01:11,316 --> 01:01:14,270
Well, then, there cannot be
much more to be said.

647
01:01:17,149 --> 01:01:21,739
- Good day, Sir Robert.

648
01:01:26,176 --> 01:01:29,481
Could you please ask Lady Portman
to come in as you leave?

649
01:01:30,649 --> 01:01:32,558
Yes, ma'am.

650
01:01:42,392 --> 01:01:45,460
I wonder if you could have a note
delivered to Lord Melbourne.

651
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:47,216
Of course, ma'am.

652
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:04,873
Mrs Melbourne!

653
01:02:06,438 --> 01:02:10,632
- Good God! What are we coming to?
- Who was it? I didn't see.

654
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:18,739
The Duchess of Montrose. That's
the end to her career at Court, I hope.

655
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:25,764
If I ban everyone who thinks me wrong,
you and I will be alone in the ballroom.

656
01:02:27,529 --> 01:02:30,641
- With sorrow, I must inform the House

657
01:02:30,724 --> 01:02:33,076
that I have been unable
to persuade the Queen

658
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:37,545
that her ladies should not solely
adhere to the views of my opponents.

659
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:40,825
- I have therefore informed Her Majesty

660
01:02:40,908 --> 01:02:43,214
that I am not qualified
to form a government,

661
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:46,100
if I do not enjoy her confidence.

662
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:51,164
Mr Speaker, are we to understand
that the great Sir Robert Peel

663
01:02:51,254 --> 01:02:54,604
has been frightened off
by a few frilly petticoats?

664
01:02:57,686 --> 01:02:59,638
Prime Minister!

665
01:02:59,721 --> 01:03:01,630
Mr Speaker, what frightens me

666
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:04,830
is to see the Crown
used as a shuttlecock

667
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:08,459
- in the game of politics!

668
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,741
Which, apparently,
Lord Melbourne plays better than you!

669
01:03:11,824 --> 01:03:13,620
- Order!

670
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:15,292
Constitutional crisis!

671
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:19,367
Queen flouts Prime Minister!
Threat to bring down Tory government!

672
01:03:19,454 --> 01:03:21,567
- Order!
- Constitutional crisis!

673
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:23,878
You should be
ashamed of yourself, sir.

674
01:03:23,968 --> 01:03:26,354
If the Queen has been foolish,
she can plead youth.

675
01:03:26,445 --> 01:03:28,510
You are old enough to know better.

676
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,110
What troubles you is that Lord
Melbourne is Prime Minister again.

677
01:03:32,195 --> 01:03:34,228
I do hate a bad loser.

678
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:38,777
We are all losers in this, sir.
Most especially the Queen.

679
01:03:38,866 --> 01:03:41,057
You have to understand you reign

680
01:03:41,142 --> 01:03:43,937
by right of Parliament.
Work with the voters' choice.

681
01:03:44,019 --> 01:03:46,972
- Lord Melbourne says...
- He says what suits his interest.

682
01:03:47,054 --> 01:03:48,769
He has used you to punish his enemies

683
01:03:48,851 --> 01:03:51,080
without a thought
for the damage to the Crown.

684
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:54,520
The Queen is in the clutches
of Melbourne, the great seducer!

685
01:03:54,604 --> 01:03:57,874
And when he is silent,
who does she listen to?

686
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:02,583
- Her German mother.
- I'm glad he thinks I listen to Mama.

687
01:04:02,673 --> 01:04:07,057
You are confusing stubbornness
with strength, my dear.

688
01:04:07,146 --> 01:04:10,133
And I warn you,
the people will not like you for it.

689
01:04:16,172 --> 01:04:19,127
She's brought down
a government over her ladies?

690
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:21,844
- Apparently.
- Then she's a fool.

691
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:25,435
No, she is not a fool.
But she has listened to a fool.

692
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,473
Then she had better change her advisor.

693
01:04:28,554 --> 01:04:31,941
Or things will get worse
before they get better.

694
01:04:39,538 --> 01:04:42,924
- Open the door.

695
01:04:43,014 --> 01:04:45,161
"Not all the water
in the rough, rude sea

696
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:49,081
can wash the balm off
from an anointed king."

697
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:53,717
"The breath of worldly men

698
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:58,343
cannot depose the deputy
elected by the Lord."

699
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:01,182
- "For every man..."

700
01:05:01,269 --> 01:05:02,983
Sir John, what are you doing here?

701
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,020
- I must speak to the Queen.
- You know that's impossible.

702
01:05:09,735 --> 01:05:13,122
"Welcome, my lord.
How far off lies your power?"

703
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:18,162
An armed man
has been found in the gardens.

704
01:05:18,245 --> 01:05:21,389
- What?!
- He said he wished to harm the Queen.

705
01:05:21,478 --> 01:05:25,308
".. discomfort guides my tongue
and bids me speak of nothing but..."

706
01:05:43,768 --> 01:05:47,960
They think I have interfered in matters
that do not concern me.

707
01:05:51,316 --> 01:05:53,351
It'll pass, ma'am, you'll see.

708
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,336
My dear Victoria,
while these days may feel endless,

709
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:03,015
please do not lose faith
in yourself or your people.

710
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,065
We are all allowed to make mistakes,

711
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,171
most especially when
we have looked to others for guidance.

712
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:14,289
The storm still rages
outside the palace walls.

713
01:06:14,379 --> 01:06:17,417
I wonder now if everyone was right.

714
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:22,700
Perhaps I am too young and
inexperienced for my position.

715
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:28,821
Open your mind, examine your choices,

716
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:31,894
and your honesty
will take you through the storm.

717
01:06:31,982 --> 01:06:35,055
I promise that you can do this work
and do it well.

718
01:06:35,143 --> 01:06:36,941
You have courage and heart

719
01:06:37,024 --> 01:06:40,652
and you said yourself
you're stronger than you look.

720
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:50,175
A letter from your mother.

721
01:06:52,465 --> 01:06:54,297
My dearest child.

722
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,946
You will not let me come to you,

723
01:06:57,026 --> 01:06:59,416
and that I may deserve,

724
01:06:59,507 --> 01:07:01,735
but however you resent me,

725
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:07,026
however I have failed,
I am still and always your mother.

726
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,019
What troubles you, troubles me.

727
01:07:10,107 --> 01:07:13,384
What pleases you, pleases me.

728
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:15,105
I love you.

729
01:07:15,187 --> 01:07:20,467
And my only prayer is that one day
you will understand how much.

730
01:07:20,548 --> 01:07:24,462
Goodnight, mein Liebling.
Your own Mama.

731
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:37,101
My dearest Albert.

732
01:07:37,191 --> 01:07:41,025
You asked me once
if you could be of help to me,

733
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:47,666
and I so proud and confident
of my great powers replied, "Not yet".

734
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:53,390
But since that day
so much has changed.

735
01:08:01,072 --> 01:08:04,065
I'm not forgiven yet.

736
01:08:04,153 --> 01:08:05,745
Not yet, but soon.

737
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,950
Just wait for unseasonal weather
or the news of some elopement,

738
01:08:09,033 --> 01:08:11,070
and it'll all be forgotten.

739
01:08:11,154 --> 01:08:13,952
You don't have a very high opinion
of ordinary people,

740
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:15,547
do you, Lord Melbourne?

741
01:08:16,835 --> 01:08:20,065
With respect,
I have lived longer than Your Majesty.

742
01:08:21,395 --> 01:08:22,908
I said once I didn't understand

743
01:08:22,996 --> 01:08:26,465
whose task it was
to see to the public welfare.

744
01:08:26,555 --> 01:08:30,232
Ma'am, in my lifetime,
I have seen with my own eyes,

745
01:08:30,317 --> 01:08:32,466
what happens
when the rabble is empowered.

746
01:08:32,556 --> 01:08:34,070
Lord Melbourne.

747
01:08:34,157 --> 01:08:39,436
I want a report on living conditions,
on parish benefits,

748
01:08:39,517 --> 01:08:44,114
housing, all of it.
And by the end of the month.

749
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:50,358
And one more thing,... I have invited
Prince Albert for another visit.

750
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:52,430
Very good, Your Majesty.

751
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:57,471
When you get there, don't be a spy
or Uncle Leopold's puppet.

752
01:08:57,559 --> 01:08:59,949
It's your life, Albert. Live it.

753
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,235
For yourself and for Victoria.

754
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,468
Our uncle wouldn't thank you for that.

755
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,277
I don't care.

756
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:19,914
- I should have worn the red.
- You look beautiful, Your Majesty.

757
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:29,756
His Serene Highness Prince Albert of
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Your Majesty.

758
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:22,446
I only just got your note.

759
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:25,041
I was riding.

760
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,443
Sit. Please.

761
01:10:39,692 --> 01:10:43,081
- The park is marvellous.
- I'm so pleased you like it.

762
01:10:44,091 --> 01:10:47,528
I do want you to feel quite at home.

763
01:10:50,692 --> 01:10:54,970
I'm sure you're aware
why I wished you to come here.

764
01:10:56,573 --> 01:10:59,372
Because it would make me happier
than anything,...

765
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:04,691
.. too happy, really,
if you would agree to what I wish.

766
01:11:04,774 --> 01:11:07,811
- And stay with you?
- And stay with me.

767
01:11:07,894 --> 01:11:12,126
- And marry you?
- And marry me.

768
01:11:42,496 --> 01:11:46,286
Wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife?

769
01:11:47,297 --> 01:11:49,653
To live together
after God's ordinance,

770
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:54,654
- in the holiest state of matrimony?
- I will.

771
01:12:44,024 --> 01:12:46,583
Now I am quite married.

772
01:12:50,145 --> 01:12:52,658
- You know when we're old...
- Hmm.

773
01:12:53,985 --> 01:12:56,295
.. and surrounded by our children,...

774
01:12:58,387 --> 01:13:01,538
.. we will remember this
as the day our lives began.

775
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:05,256
Not too surrounded, please.

776
01:13:10,867 --> 01:13:12,858
And not too soon.

777
01:13:13,828 --> 01:13:17,662
Oh? I should warn you that
I am expecting a very large family.

778
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:28,102
- Good morning, wife.
- Good morning.

779
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,782
Have you woken Her Majesty?

780
01:13:38,871 --> 01:13:41,623
- No, ma'am.
- Don't you think you should?

781
01:13:41,711 --> 01:13:44,704
No, ma'am. Not this morning, I don't.

782
01:13:52,071 --> 01:13:54,711
Let's take a little tour
and visit Scotland.

783
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:58,546
I hear if any part of Britain is like
Germany, it's the Scottish Highlands.

784
01:13:58,632 --> 01:14:01,785
- Yes, we must one day.
- No. Straight away. Now.

785
01:14:01,874 --> 01:14:04,592
- Now?
- Only for a few weeks.

786
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:07,632
You're a bride.
They can't expect you back before that.

787
01:14:07,714 --> 01:14:10,626
Dearest, I may be a bride
but I'm also a queen.

788
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:14,105
I cannot be away
for more than three days at the most.

789
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,594
What are you doing?

790
01:14:19,676 --> 01:14:23,065
- Well, if we've only got three days...

791
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:28,185
So tell me, will the weather
be this fine for all of the three days?

792
01:14:28,275 --> 01:14:30,074
Yes.

793
01:14:42,118 --> 01:14:44,394
Albert, where are you going?

794
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:02,357
- Seriously, is it always like this?
- Yes!

795
01:15:54,927 --> 01:15:57,646
We will take care of each other,
won't we?

796
01:15:58,726 --> 01:15:59,921
Always.

797
01:16:21,169 --> 01:16:24,287
- How changeable they are.

798
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:28,839
They hate you. They love you.
They hate you.

799
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:33,007
They punished her,...
but they never hated her.

800
01:16:34,531 --> 01:16:39,764
And now she's a bride and back on top.
Until the next mistake.

801
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:44,965
What on earth have I done with my life?

802
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:49,931
I had many gifts, you know.

803
01:16:50,014 --> 01:16:53,403
As a boy, I was tipped for success.

804
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:58,171
You have served me well.

805
01:17:04,214 --> 01:17:06,728
What is that?

806
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:30,973
Dear Albert, why haven't you
responded to my last two letters?

807
01:17:31,058 --> 01:17:34,015
I must be kept informed
of your progess.

808
01:17:34,097 --> 01:17:36,373
I need help. England's help.

809
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:39,256
And you must and will secure it for me.

810
01:17:39,338 --> 01:17:42,412
Never forget
that you are first a Coburg.

811
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,216
Your Uncle Leopold.

812
01:17:53,941 --> 01:17:58,331
- What is it?
- Just a question for Lord M.

813
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:03,134
- Could I help?
- It'll keep.

814
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:19,975
Why are these windows so dirty?
I can hardly see out.

815
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,940
Same as the fires, I'm afraid.

816
01:18:22,023 --> 01:18:26,062
The departments can't agree to wash
inside and out at the same time.

817
01:18:26,143 --> 01:18:29,056
- Why don't we do something about it?
- I quite agree.

818
01:18:29,145 --> 01:18:34,264
Because it's how things are done here.
And it's worked well for many years.

819
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:37,065
Meanwhile, we live
in a filthy, freezing house.

820
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:40,058
We live as guests of the Queen.

821
01:18:40,146 --> 01:18:44,184
Thank you, Baroness, for reminding me
that I am a guest here.

822
01:18:53,267 --> 01:18:55,224
Let him go.

823
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:59,668
How is Albert settling in?

824
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:01,738
Why? What have you heard?

825
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:10,019
He says he wants to reorganise
the way the palaces are run.

826
01:19:10,109 --> 01:19:12,670
Well then, for Heaven's sake, let him!

827
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,138
He says
that Lord Melbourne controls me,

828
01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:17,585
and he says that Lehzen controls me.

829
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,899
It seems everyone controls me
except him.

830
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:24,621
A man who has no work
becomes ridiculous.

831
01:19:24,711 --> 01:19:29,502
And a poor man with a rich wife must
work twice as hard as anyone else.

832
01:19:29,592 --> 01:19:34,268
- Besides, you have chosen well.
- My Uncle William chose well.

833
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:38,425
- You did not take on half his duties
- You don't know that.

834
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:41,028
You don't know what I did.

835
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:56,545
- What is this for?
- Your Royal Highness.

836
01:19:56,634 --> 01:20:00,786
The Red Room dinner service, sir.
For the officers guarding the King.

837
01:20:01,753 --> 01:20:06,432
- What king?
- King George lll, sir.

838
01:20:06,516 --> 01:20:08,392
And how often do we provide

839
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:11,832
this dinner for a king
who has been dead for 20 years?

840
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:14,348
Every night, sir.

841
01:20:18,715 --> 01:20:22,266
I cannot believe I'm being
subjected to this interrogation.

842
01:20:22,357 --> 01:20:25,906
You're not being subjected
to anything, Sir John.

843
01:20:25,997 --> 01:20:29,355
You have been in charge of the
Duchess's finances for many years.

844
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:33,398
Indeed, you have made public
statements testifying to their health.

845
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,067
- Yes, I have.
- I am so grateful.

846
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:40,549
All I am asking is that you
will be so good as to tell us

847
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,029
exactly where the money has gone?

848
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,352
Are you sure?

849
01:21:11,244 --> 01:21:13,198
- Congratulations, ma'am.

850
01:21:13,282 --> 01:21:15,434
Mein liebes Schatzi! I'm so happy.

851
01:21:17,925 --> 01:21:21,234
- Meine Liebling!
- Heavens, Mama, don't crush me.

852
01:21:22,205 --> 01:21:25,800
You'll let me know at once
if there's anything you need.

853
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:33,115
You're not going already?

854
01:21:34,005 --> 01:21:37,041
I cannot leave too soon for my daughter.

855
01:21:37,124 --> 01:21:41,439
- Anyway, I have a lot on my mind.
- Something I could help with?

856
01:21:46,047 --> 01:21:47,957
Congratulations.

857
01:21:51,127 --> 01:21:53,005
Your Highness.

858
01:21:53,088 --> 01:21:56,239
There's your opening,
if you'll take my advice.

859
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:58,524
Lord Melbourne, forgive me, but...

860
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:02,648
you seem to have confused me
with a member of your club.

861
01:22:02,729 --> 01:22:06,880
I am not your drinking companion,
nor your whist partner.

862
01:22:06,968 --> 01:22:09,928
I am the husband of your sovereign.

863
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:13,047
And as such,
I will make my own decisions,

864
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:17,329
and I neither seek
nor invite your advice.

865
01:22:17,411 --> 01:22:19,402
Good evening.

866
01:22:23,452 --> 01:22:25,726
- So...

867
01:22:25,811 --> 01:22:29,088
- Are you discussing names?
- We're discussing the help.

868
01:22:29,172 --> 01:22:32,721
He writes that he'd prefer
not to talk politics in his letters,

869
01:22:32,812 --> 01:22:35,608
but only to discuss news of the family.

870
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:37,921
I have planned this marriage
for 20 years!

871
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:41,084
And now I'm supposed to accept
that I have failed?!

872
01:22:41,172 --> 01:22:45,291
On the contrary, Your Majesty,
we must accept it.

873
01:22:45,373 --> 01:22:47,362
The birds have flown.

874
01:23:17,775 --> 01:23:19,653
Your Majesty.

875
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:05,856
I've been boring
Sir Robert and the Duke

876
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:08,331
with my ideas for encouraging the Arts.

877
01:24:08,422 --> 01:24:11,175
Hmm. Does Sir Robert
care for such frivolity?

878
01:24:11,262 --> 01:24:12,981
I have many interests, ma'am.

879
01:24:13,063 --> 01:24:15,657
And my government
would support the Prince's plans.

880
01:24:15,743 --> 01:24:18,495
Your government?
What government is this?

881
01:24:18,582 --> 01:24:23,373
If I should be fortunate enough
to form another government, ma'am.

882
01:24:23,463 --> 01:24:27,743
And when he does, there'll be
no repeat of the old problem.

883
01:24:27,825 --> 01:24:30,861
Some of your ladies have
already agreed to resign.

884
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:34,653
And Sir Robert will ask for
no more change than that.

885
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:39,777
Thank you, Sir Robert.

886
01:24:48,147 --> 01:24:51,663
How dare you speak to me in that way
before them.

887
01:24:52,626 --> 01:24:56,860
How dare you... talk across me,
as if I were a child.

888
01:24:56,948 --> 01:25:00,657
- I... I did no such thing.
- Oh, no?

889
01:25:00,748 --> 01:25:03,422
Well, you've sorted this,
you've sorted that.

890
01:25:03,509 --> 01:25:05,147
You and Sir Robert.

891
01:25:05,229 --> 01:25:07,459
You and the Duke.
All without reference to me!

892
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:11,177
- Victoria, I thought you'd be pleased.
- I will tell you what you thought.

893
01:25:11,268 --> 01:25:13,339
You thought that I was a woman!

894
01:25:13,429 --> 01:25:17,468
To be petted
and passed over and ignored!

895
01:25:17,549 --> 01:25:22,021
Would it were so simple then we might
avoid more scandals of your making.

896
01:25:22,110 --> 01:25:24,909
- Have you lost your mind?!
- Do you wonder at it?

897
01:25:24,991 --> 01:25:29,302
Less than three years on the throne
and you and your precious Melbourne

898
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:32,065
have pushed this monarchy
to the brink of an abyss!

899
01:25:32,152 --> 01:25:34,301
I've told you before and I will again,

900
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:37,145
you are my husband here,
and that is all!

901
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:42,591
- And that is quite enough, believe me!
- I will not have my role usurped!

902
01:25:42,673 --> 01:25:43,992
I wear the crown.

903
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:47,668
Any mistakes will be my mistakes,
and no one else will make them.

904
01:25:47,753 --> 01:25:50,143
No one! Not even you!

905
01:25:55,475 --> 01:25:58,672
I'm leaving before you excite
yourself and harm the child.

906
01:25:58,755 --> 01:26:01,145
You will go when I dismiss you.

907
01:26:02,756 --> 01:26:06,191
I am your Queen
and I am telling you to stay.

908
01:26:08,036 --> 01:26:10,150
Goodnight, Victoria.

909
01:26:11,075 --> 01:26:13,670
You may not go. You may not go!

910
01:26:13,756 --> 01:26:17,829
I order you to stay here in this room!
Albert!

911
01:26:24,277 --> 01:26:26,190
Guard, royal salute!

912
01:26:26,279 --> 01:26:28,268
Present arms!

913
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,234
There is no need
for you to accompany me.

914
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,835
I said I would and so I will.

915
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:50,913
Walk on. Hup!

916
01:27:06,563 --> 01:27:10,032
For pity's sake smile, woman.
Anyone would think we'd quarrelled.

917
01:27:10,122 --> 01:27:11,521
Don't talk to me.

918
01:28:43,655 --> 01:28:47,806
There's nothing more I can do here.
The Prince needs rest.

919
01:28:48,655 --> 01:28:50,564
Your Majesty.

920
01:29:03,375 --> 01:29:05,368
I'm so sorry!

921
01:29:07,898 --> 01:29:10,889
I thought I was going to lose you!

922
01:29:11,858 --> 01:29:16,055
- He was not a very good shot.
- Why did you do it?

923
01:29:16,137 --> 01:29:19,130
You're so stupid! Why did you do it?

924
01:29:21,418 --> 01:29:23,808
I had two very good reasons.

925
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:28,010
First, I am replaceable
and you are not.

926
01:29:28,099 --> 01:29:31,853
- You are not replaceable to me.
- Shh.

927
01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:37,936
Second,... you are the only wife
I've got or ever will have.

928
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:43,898
You are my whole existence. And
I will love you until my last breath.

929
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:01,254
We're told the man was mad.

930
01:30:02,342 --> 01:30:04,732
Is that reassuring? I can't decide.

931
01:30:06,224 --> 01:30:08,214
May I be honest, ma'am?

932
01:30:09,983 --> 01:30:13,057
- Even a politician can be sometimes.

933
01:30:14,864 --> 01:30:19,654
My guidance...
hasn't always been faultless,...

934
01:30:20,904 --> 01:30:23,295
.. and I'm sorry for it.

935
01:30:25,347 --> 01:30:28,782
- But I speak now as a true friend.
- I know.

936
01:30:31,187 --> 01:30:36,181
The Prince is a good man.
A better man than any of us knew.

937
01:30:37,945 --> 01:30:43,305
I know he does not think as well of me.
My vanity is not the issue here.

938
01:30:44,066 --> 01:30:45,945
He is able.

939
01:30:46,028 --> 01:30:47,746
He is clever.

940
01:30:48,509 --> 01:30:50,305
And he's faithful.

941
01:30:52,228 --> 01:30:54,106
Let him share your work.

942
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:06,901
There is one task more
Your Majesty must face,...

943
01:31:06,992 --> 01:31:09,789
if the Prince
is to feel truly welcome here.

944
01:31:15,351 --> 01:31:18,150
I needed her so much as a child.

945
01:31:32,832 --> 01:31:36,110
I hope you don't mind,
I had your desk brought in.

946
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:43,227
- Don't I have a say in this?
- No!

947
01:32:09,077 --> 01:32:12,592
- Good morning, wife.
- Good morning.

948
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:41,764
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.
Her Majesty the Queen.
