{2340}{2446}Is everything okay, sir?|- Fine. Thank you.
{2448}{2544}Here. Let me, uh--|- That's not necessary, sir.
{3455}{3587}As I've gotten older, I realize|I'm certain of only two things.
{3588}{3756}Days that begin with rowing on a lake|are better than days that do not.
{3758}{3905}Second,|a man 's character is his fate.
{3907}{4021}And, as a student of history,,|I find this hard to refute.
{4023}{4148}For most of us, our stories can|be written long before we die.
{4196}{4289}There are exceptions among|the great men of history,...
{4292}{4389}but they are rare,|and I am not one of them.
{4500}{4606}I am a teacher... simply that.
{4608}{4683}I taught for 34 years.
{4685}{4764}One day I stopped teaching.
{4767}{4865}Those were the facts|ofmy life's chronicle.
{4866}{4985}The last chapter had been written.|My book was closed.
{5100}{5160}Hello?
{5243}{5349}Hello. Hello?
{5485}{5599}Mr. Hundert?|- Yes. Hello.
{5601}{5697}Can you hear me, sir?|- I can.
{5698}{5785}Hello. Mr. Bell wanted to make sure|you were comfortable.
{5787}{5856}I'm quite comfortable.|Thank you. And-And, please,...
{5859}{5954}thank Mr. Bell|for the beautiful fruit basket.
{5956}{6063}It's quite... comprehensive.|Yes, sir.
{6065}{6135}Mr. Bell also wanted me|to tell you he's added an event...
{6137}{6210}on the morning|following the competition...
{6211}{6273}a breakfast in your honor.
{6343}{6408}Mr. Hundert?|- Yes... Yes.
{6410}{6469}Th-Thank you.|Thank you.
{6470}{6581}The others will be heading down|to the bar in 20 minutes, sir.
{6583}{6647}Uh, very well.|Twenty minutes.
{6649}{6758}In the bar.|I'll be there.
{7132}{7265}I couldn't tell you exactly|why I had agreed to come.
{7266}{7388}I'm not sure I knew.|It had something to do with hope.
{7464}{7540}The young men that were|gathering here were among...
{7542}{7656}the most successful and influential|of their generation.
{7658}{7724}But I knew them|before any of that.
{7727}{7800}I knew them as my students...
{7802}{7893}at Saint Benedict's|School for Boys.
{9371}{9520}ooking closer, under the bishop's miter,|are the words, "Non sibi'"...
{9523}{9620}or "Not for oneself."
{9622}{9719}This embodies ourphilosophy|at Saint Benedict's.
{9722}{9851}The wisdom gained here|should be used for others...
{9854}{9916}as well as for oneself.
{9918}{10060}And finally,|"Finis origine pendet."
{10062}{10240}These three words are emblazoned|across your hearts...
{10241}{10312}under the great seal|of Saint Benedict's.
{10314}{10384}It is our academy's motto.|Simply:
{10385}{10452}"The end depends upon|the beginning."
{10454}{10518}The end...
{10520}{10626}depends upon the beginning.
{11030}{11111}Hey, Greg.|How are you doin'?
{11354}{11414}Hi, Mr. Hundert.|Mr. Ericks.
{11494}{11571}Ex-Excuse me.|Huh? What me?
{11572}{11647}Yes, sir. What is your name?|- Uh, Louis.
{11650}{11754}Just Louis?|- Louis Masoudi, sir.
{11756}{11866}Mr. Masoudi, could you define|the word "path" for me?
{11868}{11963}Well, there are several|definitions, I suppose.
{11964}{12062}Would "a route along which someone|or something moves" be among them?
{12065}{12132}Yeah.
{12133}{12210}Oh, yeah. No. Yeah.|I'm sorry, sir.
{12212}{12350}Follow the path, Mr. Masoudi. Walk|where the great men before you have walked.
{12352}{12437}Yes, sir. It's, uh...|It's better for the grass.
{12440}{12521}It's better for you.
{12524}{12587}Mr. Hundert.|Mr. Ellerby.
{12590}{12666}I wanted to thank you.|- For what?
{12669}{12778}Mr. Woodbridge let slip that you were|instrumental in my procuring this job.
{12780}{12862}Bene exeat, sir.|Bene meritus.
{12863}{12928}It's always good to have|another friend of the classics.
{12929}{12988}I'll tell you,|the way he talks about you...
{12989}{13105}"Just listen to Mr. Hundert.|He'll be running the place one day."
{13116}{13205}Your name, sir?|- Robert Brewster, sir.
{13207}{13289}Very good. And you?|- Deepak Mehta, sir.
{13291}{13367}And your name?|Eugene Field, sir.
{13369}{13460}Field. And you?|Martin Blythe, sir?
{13463}{13588}Is that a question?|- Uh, no, sir.
{13591}{13652}Uh, my name|is Martin Blythe, sir.
{13654}{13726}Very good.|You all know your own names.
{13729}{13798}Question is, do I?
{13827}{13954}Mister... Blythe.|- Me, sir?
{13957}{14073}Yes, you.|Not Mr. Field to your right...
{14075}{14201}or Mr. Grey to your left|or Mr. Diebel behind you.
{14203}{14303}You, sir. Will you do me a favor|and walk to the back of this classroom...
{14305}{14423}and read for us the plaque which|you see hanging over that door?
{14735}{14817}"I am Sh-Shu--"'
{14849}{14991}"I am Sh-Shutruk-Nahhunte"?|- Very good. A little louder, please.
{14992}{15158}Yes, sir. "I am Shutruk-Nahhunte,|King of Ansham and Susa,...
{15160}{15221}"sovereign of the land of Elam.
{15224}{15370}I destroyed Sippar and took the|'stel-ah' of... "Stele."
{15371}{15488}"Took the stele of Naram-Sin|and brought it back to Elam,
{15490}{15560}"where I erect edit as|an offering to my god.
{15562}{15699}Shutruk-Nahhunte, 1158 B.C."
{15701}{15787}Well done, Mr. Blythe.|Thank you. You may be seated.
{15790}{15852}"Shutruk-Nahhunte."|Is anyone familiar with this fellow?
{15854}{15912}Texts are permissible.
{15914}{16002}But you won't find it there.
{16004}{16107}Shutruk-Nahhunte! King!
{16110}{16250}Sovereign of the land of Elam!|Destroyer of Sippar!
{16252}{16392}Behold, his accomplishments cannot be|found in any history book. Why?
{16394}{16497}Because great ambition|and conquest...
{16499}{16559}without contribution...
{16561}{16622}is without significance.
{16679}{16755}What will your contribution be?
{16802}{16890}How will history remember you?
{16978}{17068}Shutruk-Nahhunte...|utterly forgotten.
{17070}{17202}Unlike the great men you see|around you... Aristotle,...
{17204}{17270}Caesar,...
{17272}{17330}Augustus,...
{17332}{17462}Plato, Cicero, Socrates...
{17465}{17595}giants of history,|men of profound character.
{17668}{17786}Men whose accomplishments|surpassed their own lifetime...
{17788}{17895}and survive|even into our own.
{17897}{17965}Their story,...
{17967}{18035}is our story.
{18130}{18210}My name is Mr. Hundert.
{18213}{18291}Welcome|to Western Civilization:
{18293}{18385}The Greeks and the Romans.
{18538}{18596}Welcome|to Saint Benedict's!
{18680}{18779}Lights out in five minutes,|gentlemen.
{18825}{18925}It's awfully loud, Mr.Jones.|Please turn it down.
{18927}{19010}Did you... Her titties are so...|After that, though...
{19012}{19070}No. After that, I was walking|back to get my books.
{19072}{19138}And I was walking along the grass,|and Hundert comes up to me and says,
{19141}{19237}"Mr. Masoudi" and I turned around but I took care ofit.|- Yeah, I know. Yeah.
{19239}{19307}And then, he's like,|"Follow the path, Mr. Masoudi.
{19310}{19370}Walkwhere the great men|before you have walked."
{19372}{19523}Very,good, Mr. Masoudi.|- I was just lettin' him know. That's why I was tellin' him.
{19526}{19583}To bed.
{19586}{19660}Yeah. Right.|See you tomorrow.
{19662}{19757}Lights out in five minutes,|gentlemen.
{19759}{19863}Just why am I...|Huh? No. I'm going.
{19938}{20012}Goodnight, Mr. Bllythe.|Yeah. Good night. Good night.
{20015}{20074}Jesus Christ.|I am such an asshole.
{20239}{20297}Carthaginians.
{20356}{20415}Yes, sir.
{20418}{20502}Hamilcar Barca seems like|an outstanding commander.
{20504}{20607}Yes, who had the misfortune|of being on the losingside.
{20609}{20696}You do realize that|Hamilcar Barca is not part|of the course reading list?
{20697}{20741}Yes, sir.
{20775}{20834}Very good.
{20872}{20939}Lights out.
{21094}{21184}9:00, gentlemen.
{21186}{21250}Good night.
{21455}{21512}Hi.
{21739}{21841}Hello.|- Oh, hi.
{21873}{21933}Welcome back.
{21964}{22042}It's great to see you!|You too. How are you?
{22045}{22122}I'm fine.|You sure you're all right?
{22125}{22186}Ye-Yeah.
{22188}{22296}What did you think of Athens?|- Oh. I loved it.
{22299}{22387}I knew you would.|Tony hated it, but you know the British.
{22390}{22457}"Too many Greeks."
{22458}{22578}Tony's Tony.|Here.
{22580}{22650}I told the man in the store|I wanted something...
{22652}{22746}for a very serious scholar|of antiquity.
{23030}{23089}The Parthenon.
{23091}{23186}It's smaller than I remember it.
{23188}{23263}I don't have one of these.|Thank you.
{23265}{23326}I found it in the agora.
{23329}{23437}Tony couldn't understand why I wanted to|go there. It's a little touristy now,...
{23439}{23530}but I kept hearing|your voice in my head.
{23531}{23607}And I kept seeing it exactly|the way you described it,
{23609}{23700}with Socrates teaching|right in front ofme.
{23703}{23813}And... there was Tony, falling|asleep from the heat and ouzo,...
{23815}{23881}and me eating|my shish kabob.
{23884}{23972}I thought about you a lot.
{23975}{24058}I wished you were there.|- It would've been a little odd though...
{24060}{24121}with you and me and Socrates...
{24122}{24182}and your sleeping husband.
{24235}{24302}Yeah. A little.
{24779}{24848}And with the monarchy's demise,|two new systems...
{24850}{24934}of government... the first,|ruled by the few, known as?
{24936}{25026}Mr. Brewster.|Uh, tyranny?
{25029}{25117}In spirit, perhaps,|but etymologically, no.
{25119}{25177}More precisely, oligarchy.
{25179}{25283}Tyranny is what we have|in this classroom. It works.
{25336}{25414}Mr. Bllythe?|Antisthenes: "We must have richness of soul."
{25416}{25547}Oh, it was, uh, Heraclitus, when he said a|man's character is his fate or his destiny.
{25549}{25644}Precisely. "Not to know what happened|before you were born...
{25646}{25713}is to be forever a child."
{25868}{25972}Mr.Julius Caesar...
{25975}{26050}is a Saint Benedict's tradition.
{26053}{26158}It is a contest held each year|in two phases.
{26161}{26220}The first, is a series of quizzes...
{26223}{26297}that will narrow the field|of competitors to three.
{26300}{26363}The second|is a public tournament...
{26366}{26435}where these three will take the stage|at Saint Benedict's Hall...
{26438}{26511}and answer questions|about Roman history,.
{26513}{26583}The last man standing|will be declared the winner...
{26584}{26682}and crowned|Mr.Julius Caesar.
{26684}{26778}Your father was a winner was he not, Mr. Bllythe?|- Yes, sir.
{26780}{26893}Would you point him out|to us, please?
{26964}{27053}A noble honor indeed.
{27054}{27166}Well, carry on, gentlemen.
{27168}{27228}Thank you, Mr. Woodbridge.
{27563}{27690}Finally, Caesararrives|at the Rubicon,
{27693}{27762}a small little river|which divides... Mr. Field?
{27765}{27846}Cisalpine Gaul from Italy.|- Correct.
{27849}{27969}He gathers his one legion around him.|A legion comprised of how many men... Mr. Grey?
{27971}{28097}6,000?|- 6,000 men. Pompey has 10 legions...
{28099}{28207}with the support of the Senate, and Caesar|is undaunted by these odds.
{28210}{28319}Suddenly... impulsively...
{28321}{28401}Caesar cries out! Mr. Mehta.
{28404}{28519}"Alea jacta est."|- "The die is cast!"
{28521}{28627}He crosses the Rubicon|only to find his enemies have fled.
{28629}{28695}He chases Pompey|all around the Mediterranean.
{28698}{28808}Finally, he arrives in Alexandria,|where the king of Egypt...
{28810}{28904}Mr. Masoudi?|- Ptolemy XIII?
{28905}{29019}Ptolemy XIII...|presents him with a gift...
{29020}{29120}the head of Pompey.
{29230}{29315}Mr. Hundert,...
{29316}{29386}I'd like you to make|the acquaintance...
{29387}{29474}of Mr. Sedgewick Bell.
{29477}{29546}Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bell.
{29549}{29639}Well then, carry on, Mr. Hundert.
{29641}{29732}Nice to meet you, son.|Thank you, sir.
{29735}{29797}Gentlemen, I'd like you to welcome|a new member of our class,
{29799}{29895}Mr. Sedgewick Bell.
{29910}{29984}Come in.
{30016}{30085}The sign said|this was a boy's school.
{30135}{30238}It is a boy's school.|- So why is everyone wearing dresses?
{30241}{30336}These are not dresses.
{30339}{30438}This is a toga. It is a loose|outer garment worn by...
{30441}{30521}Worn by citizens of ancient Rome.|I know.
{30524}{30612}I was just... kidding with you.
{30615}{30726}The toga was best owed on young men|in recognition of their transition...
{30729}{30853}from childishness|to manhood.
{30856}{30898}So?
{30973}{31032}Please.|Come in. Sit down.
{31034}{31092}Have a seat here|behind Mr. Brewster.
{31094}{31192}You know what?|I actually think that I'm good here.
{31251}{31309}Mr. Bell.
{31311}{31389}Mr. Hundert.
{31493}{31552}Have a seat.
{31890}{31973}Now, uh, before I forget,...
{31974}{32064}tomorrow we will begin on Shakespeare's|Julius Caesar. I expect you all...
{32067}{32137}to be familiar with the play.
{32138}{32251}Mr. Bell, I'd like you to look|at the role of Brutus,...
{32254}{32333}the noblest Roman|of them all.
{32335}{32405}Mr. Masoudi, you have|a lean and hungry look,...
{32407}{32489}you'll read the part|of Cassius.
{32618}{32682}He's the son of Hyram Bell,...
{32684}{32753}the senior senator|from West Virginia.
{32756}{32845}Well, whoever the father is, the son|is a bit of a Visigoth, I'm afraid.
{32847}{32933}Is he that bad?|- No, I don't think so.
{32936}{33045}It's just new school bravado.|That's all. He'll be fine.
{33384}{33476}Sedgewick?
{33528}{33612}Right. Sedgewick.
{33647}{33721}Hey! Se-Sedgewick.
{33758}{33848}Um, some of us were just...
{33851}{33939}just wondering...
{33942}{34029}Actually, Martin... Martin was wondering|if you could keep it down.
{34032}{34089}He's trying to study.
{34337}{34407}Okay. All right. That's...
{34499}{34578}"I think it is not meet Mark Antony,|so well-beloved of Caesar,
{34579}{34642}"should outlive Caesar.
{34644}{34719}Let Antony and Caesar|fall together."
{34720}{34805}"Our course will seem|too bloody, Caius Cassius,
{34807}{34871}"to cut the head off|then hack the limbs.
{34873}{34960}Like wrath in death--"
{34962}{35083}"and envy afterwards,|for Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
{35085}{35185}Let us be sacrificers,|but not butchers."
{35187}{35281}"Let us be sacrificers,|but not butchers."
{35283}{35368}Yes, your Brutus|lacks conviction, Mr. Bell.
{35370}{35483}You do realize|what you're saying? The fate|ofthe Republic is at stake!
{35486}{35547}Not for me.
{35589}{35661}No. I realize that.
{35663}{35752}But try to imagine the|significance of the moment.
{35754}{35832}You, Brutus, are at the center|of a conspiracy...
{35835}{35900}to kill Julius Caesar,...
{35902}{35969}you believe,|for the good of Rome.
{35971}{36059}Yet you're struggling profoundly|with the moral implications...
{36061}{36124}of murdering|Mark Antony as well.
{36126}{36188}Yeah, but I don't agree|with their plan.
{36191}{36251}Brutus doesn't agree|with their plan?
{36252}{36313}No. I don't agree|with their plan.
{36316}{36380}They should kill|Mark Antony too.
{36383}{36449}I mean,|Brutus is a pussy.
{36450}{36522}"A pussy"?
{36524}{36601}Because he has a conscience?
{36603}{36682}Because he believes there's a right way|and a wrong way? Oh, come on.
{36685}{36757}Antony ended up|taking him down, right?
{36759}{36820}Well, in a manner|of speaking, yes.
{36823}{36881}He and Octavius, but...|- But what?
{36884}{37005}Had they killed him,|as the other guy suggested,...
{37007}{37107}Cassius.|- Yeah. Him. If they'd done what he said,
{37109}{37209}Brutus might have gone on to be king.|- Emperor, in fact.
{37210}{37280}Exactly.|- Which he had no desire to be.
{37282}{37414}Whatever. He would've won.|- Yes, but at what cost? Remember Socrates?
{37416}{37480}Not really.
{37482}{37613}"It is not living that is important,|but living rightly."
{37615}{37723}Socrates chose to die|by unjust execution...
{37726}{37827}rather than break the laws of Athens|to which he had pledged obedience.
{37830}{37944}Another genius.
{38697}{38770}William, hold up!
{38771}{38831}Ellerby.|How are you, sir?
{38833}{38892}Very well. How are things|in the Latin Quarter?
{38894}{38963}Could not be happier.
{38964}{39029}For making me feel|so much at home.
{39031}{39130}I'm sure you have it, but you might|like it 'cause it's a first edition.
{39132}{39247}I found it in a rare bookshop next to a|copy of the Oresteia. Oh, really?
{39302}{39374}So young when he wrote this.
{39375}{39463}I happen to have attended a guest lecture|he gave at Dartmouth.
{39465}{39523}Really?|- Yeah.
{39525}{39607}It must have been something to grow up|around all that talent.
{39609}{39673}Oh, it was. Indeed.
{39707}{39810}Yes... Yes, he was...
{39851}{39910}Thank you.|Sure.
{39911}{40035}Very kind of you. Farewell.|I'll see you later.
{40176}{40292}Okay. Fio.|- I am made. I become.
{40295}{40352}Fis.
{40355}{40415}Hey, guys.
{40451}{40574}Fis.|You are made. You become.
{40577}{40659}Oh, okay,...
{40662}{40741}Fit?|- He, she, it is made.
{40743}{40850}He, she, it becomes.|It is done.
{40852}{40954}Okay, now for bonus points,|the plural of fit.
{40957}{41014}F-Fiunt.|Yeah.
{41017}{41085}Oh, okay.
{41087}{41182}Check it out.|It's from France.
{41184}{41284}Thanks.|U m. Studio.
{41286}{41344}I study.
{41346}{41404}Oh, my God.
{41406}{41469}Come on. I think we should be studying.|Oh, my God.
{41471}{41584}What?|- This shows hair.
{41624}{41695}What do you mean by "hair"?
{41797}{41859}Oh, my God.
{42246}{42329}Excuse me.
{42550}{42675}Uh, can I point out that if we get|caught around any of this we're dead?
{42677}{42783}I mean, seriously, we're dead.|- It'll be all right.
{42820}{42898}I'm going to my room|to study.
{42900}{43007}Here, Marty. Study this.
{43032}{43105}"The die is cast."
{43108}{43224}Mrs. Louis Masoudi.
{43302}{43383}Why are we doing this?|My allergies are killing me,
{43384}{43468}rocks in my shoes,|poison ivy all over the place.
{43471}{43572}I mean, the boathouse is off-limits,|and we can't leave school property.
{43573}{43652}What if this boat|has frickin' holes in it, huh?
{43654}{43717}[ Louis ]|Get over it, Martin.|Oh, God!
{43719}{43789}You guys just don't understand|the consequences.
{43791}{43876}They catch us and we get kicked out|and we don't get our tuition back.
{43878}{43982}Martin, mellow out, man!|I can't just mellow out!
{43983}{44080}I cannot get kicked out of here!|I'm a "legacy" for Christ's sake!
{44082}{44140}My father was|Mr.Julius Caesar.
{44142}{44256}Did he ever tell you what question he won on?|Did he ever not tell me?
{44259}{44335}"Which tribes invaded Rome|in 102 B.C.?"
{44338}{44408}Teutons and the Cimbri.
{44411}{44486}The last words out ofhis mouth|before he dropped me off here.
{44606}{44667}So, uh, Martin,
{44670}{44749}Dare you really, like,|Nervous about...
{44754}{44828}Incoming.
{44845}{44904}Watch out, Marty.
{44955}{45055}My informants tell me if we head for|that place... Right, Saint Mary,'s?
{45056}{45115}Yeah!|- No, no, no.
{45116}{45189}The penalty for setting|foot on Saint Mary's property...
{45191}{45304}What do you say, Deepak? You want to go?|- Yeah. I'll go.
{45306}{45365}Louis?|- Yeah. I'll go.
{45368}{45457}See, Martin?|That's the problem with democracy.
{45460}{45581}Guys, I'm really nervous.|- Yeah. We know.
{45583}{45659}I love uniforms.|I really think we should turn around.
{45661}{45744}Shut up, man.
{45796}{45870}Seriously, we got|to turn around right now.
{45872}{45941}This is not safe!|- Marty, shut up. Shut up.
{45942}{46044}Hey, come on. Easy does it, boys.
{46046}{46088}Hi.
{46117}{46204}You ladies go to school here?
{46371}{46461}We go across the lake.|We're on the crew team.
{46462}{46545}He's our "coxman," so...|Coxswain.
{46547}{46654}Right. No. Right, I know.|Coxswain.
{46656}{46738}So is it true what they say|about the guys who go...
{46740}{46830}to "Saint Benedick's"?
{46872}{46985}I don't know.|Uh, what is that exactly?
{47017}{47111}Tsk. So, uh,|what's your name?
{47113}{47185}Um, I'm Sedgewick.|This is Deepak.
{47188}{47228}Louis and Martin.|Hi.
{47231}{47310}Marty, ifyou like.|Or Mar-Martin's fine.
{47311}{47384}Why don't you give us your phone number,|and maybe we'll call you sometime.
{47387}{47474}You are such...|- Guys, what's our phone number?
{47475}{47564}555-0169|- Um, area code 215.
{47618}{47707}Okay. So, um...
{47709}{47779}Do you guys want to go|skinny-dipping?
{47781}{47865}Pardon me?|- You mean naked?
{47975}{48051}What?|What's he doin'?
{48053}{48125}Oh, my God.
{48127}{48237}So, uh, who's gonna|come with me then?
{48239}{48346}Is he kidding?|- Oh, God!
{48348}{48426}Oh, no way!|Not me. I don't want to get my arm wet.
{48428}{48488}Might lose your phone number.
{48491}{48617}That's okay. I'll just whisper it|in your ear so you won't forget.
{48619}{48711}I'll go!|- My God!
{48714}{48782}I'll go too!|- Disrobe men!
{48789}{48841}Yeah!
{48910}{48981}I'm going!
{48984}{49083}Ladies!|What is going on here?
{49085}{49145}Holyshit!|- A nun.
{49148}{49209}Oh, my God.
{49211}{49276}There goes|your tuition, Marty.
{49277}{49341}Come on!
{49350}{49469}There is a code|at Saint Benedict's...
{49470}{49553}of self-governance|based on mutual trust.
{49555}{49675}You have violated that trust.
{49678}{49794}And you've compromised|the reputation of this academy.
{49795}{49904}If I thought you didn't know any|better, that would be one thing.
{49907}{50029}But willful ignorance|is intolerable.
{50148}{50248}You're confined to the dormitory|until 7:00 tomorrow morning.
{50251}{50320}What about dinner?
{50350}{50457}Excuse me?|- Well, I'm hungry, sir.
{50459}{50536}Oh, my God!|- Mr. Masoudi?
{50617}{50676}Mr. Hundert.
{50852}{50935}Have a good evening, gentlemen.
{51190}{51252}How you doing, Mr. Hundert?
{51254}{51312}Hi, Mr. H.
{51367}{51458}Did you lock up the door?|- I did.
{51461}{51530}You did? Thanks.|- Yeah.
{51541}{51640}Hey, Logan.|How you doin'?
{52088}{52146}Brewster!
{52856}{52929}Mr. Bell,...
{52932}{52990}would you please come up to|the front of the classroom?
{53206}{53277}Would you mind finishing|this diagram for me?
{53532}{53641}Octavian was named what?
{53757}{53823}A common wood beetle on|the floor of this classroom...
{53825}{53890}would know the answer|to that question.
{53892}{54037}Emperor?|- Yes!
{54039}{54122}Can you, please, name any|ofthe subsequent emperors...
{54125}{54182}whom we've been discussing?
{54185}{54285}There were 41.|- I only know seven.
{54288}{54352}Very well.
{54355}{54472}Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Sneezy,
{54475}{54531}Dopey...
{54554}{54668}Seriously, though,|can you in fact...
{54670}{54780}name any of the emperors?|- I know four.
{54783}{54950}Very well.|- John, Paul, Ringo and...
{54952}{55055}George.|- Mr. Bell.
{55056}{55170}A word of warning.|As the great wit Aristophanes once wrote...
{55173}{55300}roughly translated...|"Youth ages, immaturity is outgrown,
{55302}{55435}"ignorance can be educated|and drunkenness sobered,
{55437}{55530}"but stupid...
{55531}{55606}lasts forever."
{55861}{55970}Class, if you please,|chronologically...
{55971}{56110}Tiberius, Caligula,|Claudius, Nero,...
{56112}{56187}Galba, Otho,...
{56188}{56265}Vitellius, Vespasian,...
{56267}{56332}Titus, Domitian,...
{56333}{56442}Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian,...
{56445}{56580}Antonius Pius, Marcus Aurelius,...
{56582}{56672}Commodus, Pertinax...|- Thank you. That will do.
{56730}{56797}Please take your seat, Mr. Bell.
{57599}{57659}Come in.
{57881}{57997}Mr. Bell.|Mr. Hundert.
{57998}{58064}Please, have a seat.
{58308}{58377}Only child?
{58405}{58462}Please be seated, Mr. Bell.
{58724}{58791}Do you know why you're here?
{58793}{58887}"Student of the day."
{58977}{59088}I gave you "1" for spelling|your name correctly.
{59089}{59166}Mr. Bell,
{59167}{59228}I don't know what you think you're|doing at Saint Benedict's,...
{59231}{59288}but this is unacceptable work.
{59291}{59371}You must apply yourself...|- You're not married, are you, sir?
{59374}{59430}No. I am not.
{59432}{59532}That's why you like|putting us all in togas, right?
{59586}{59687}I've made arrangements|to meet with your father.
{59776}{59877}Is there anything|you'd like me to say to him?
{60055}{60122}Tell him I said hello.
{61098}{61162}Well, how are you?|Good to see you.
{61165}{61243}And you, sir.|Give me just a second.
{61292}{61382}Who's that?|Professor, come on in.
{61384}{61483}Kathleen, hold all my calls.|Thank you, Michael.
{61485}{61554}Sit down, please.
{61728}{61789}Cubans.
{61791}{61889}Don't tell the A.T.F.
{61894}{61969}No. Not for me. Thanks.|- You're sure?
{61972}{62062}Oh, yes, sir.|Don't know what you're missin'.
{62241}{62355}Senator... Oh, here.|You'll enjoy this.
{62358}{62431}This was given to me by one of|my constituents this morning.
{62433}{62491}Take a look at that.|- Senator Bell's office.
{62493}{62588}Hold it! Don't be|too fast there, partner.
{62590}{62659}Quarter roll.
{62660}{62725}Here. Go on.|That was, uh...
{62726}{62845}Supposedly belonged to the coachman|of Robert E. Lee. Really?
{62847}{62906}Well, so he said.
{62913}{63000}You're a history buff,|aren't ya?
{63003}{63062}In a manner|of speaking, sir. Yes.
{63064}{63136}Well, take that.|That's yours.
{63138}{63237}Oh, no. I couldn't.|Oh, take the damn thing!
{63239}{63352}It's a gift. For all you've done|for my son, Sedgewick.
{63353}{63438}Thank you.
{63518}{63581}So, to what|do I owe this honor?
{63583}{63642}It's your son, Senator.
{63643}{63739}Oh, Christ.|What the devil's he done now?
{63741}{63855}Sedgewick is clearly an intelligent boy,|but, sir, he's not applying himself.
{63858}{63924}He's not... learning the material.
{63926}{63995}I need a match!|- Yes, Senator. Right away.
{63998}{64067}What material is that?|It's the Greeks and the Romans...
{64070}{64136}We've left the Republic|and entered the Empire...
{64138}{64197}Here you are, sir.|- Thank you.
{64198}{64270}Shut the door|on your way out, will you?
{64272}{64332}We're up to|the reign of Augustus.
{64335}{64402}You ought to be careful with that thing,|by the way. You know, it still fires.
{64404}{64487}Sedgewick, it seems,...
{64489}{64563}is not paying attention|in class, sir.
{64565}{64651}Nor is he doing|the assigned reading.
{64654}{64711}Let me ask you something.
{64714}{64804}What's the good|of what you're teachin' those boys?
{64843}{64920}"The good"?|- Yes. The good.
{64922}{65005}Well, Senator,...
{65047}{65128}the Greeks and Romans provided...
{65131}{65204}a model of democracy, which,
{65205}{65293}I don't need to tell you,|the framers of our own Constitution...
{65295}{65362}used as their inspiration.
{65365}{65511}But more to the point, I think|when the boys read Plato, Aristotle,...
{65512}{65589}Cicero, Julius Caesar even,...
{65590}{65660}they're put in direct contact|with men who,...
{65662}{65720}in their own age, exemplified...
{65722}{65806}the highest standards|of statesmanship,...
{65808}{65927}of civic virtue, of character,|conviction...
{65929}{66041}Boy, that is a horse that can talk!
{66043}{66152}So, you're sayin' that my son|Sedgewick has his head up his ass.
{66218}{66323}Sir, it's myjob to mold|your son's character,...
{66325}{66384}and I think if...|Moldhim?
{66386}{66458}Jesus God in heaven, son.
{66459}{66518}You're not gonna mold my boy.
{66519}{66621}Your job is to teach my son.
{66624}{66716}You teach him his times tables.
{66718}{66776}Teach him why the world is round.
{66778}{66855}Teach him who killed who|and when and where.
{66857}{66935}That is your job.
{66981}{67088}You, sir,|will not mold my son.
{67149}{67257}I will mold him.
{67259}{67356}Yes, sir.|- Yes.
{67466}{67526}Thanks for comin'.
{67566}{67624}Break!
{67626}{67716}Marty. Marty.|Get back. Come on.
{67718}{67813}Bell! Bell!
{67815}{67893}Uh, telephone for you.|- What?
{67896}{67956}It's a girl.
{67986}{68083}I'll bet it's that blond|from Saint Mary,'s.
{68085}{68185}It's that redhead.
{68297}{68358}Hello?
{68363}{68478}Sedgewick?|Hold for your father.
{68481}{68551}Let me ask you somethin'.|Do you know what...
{68554}{68611}it's costing me to send|you to this place?
{68613}{68683}What's wrong?|- Shut up.
{68686}{68836}My time is precious, son.|I thought I made that clear.
{68838}{68911}I got better things to do|than to clean up after you.
{68914}{69038}You understand me?|- Yes, sir. I understand.
{69041}{69117}Don't forget it.
{69321}{69400}So, what did she say, man.|What did she say?
{69403}{69478}Wrong girl.
{69481}{69549}What happened?|- I don't know.
{69559}{69646}Grey, wait up!
{70531}{70628}Deepak, would you give Sedgewick and me a moment?|- Yes, sir.
{70665}{70729}Thank you.|- You're welcome, sir.
{70774}{70865}I spoke to your father.|- I know.
{70868}{70964}We had a real...|heart-to-heart.
{71102}{71166}This is for you.
{71213}{71321}Forgive the condition.|It was my textbook in high school.
{71368}{71425}It's quite good.
{71428}{71519}The first chapter|has an outline...
{71521}{71626}of all the material which we'll|be covering this term.
{71628}{71695}I thought it might|be helpful in preparing...
{71697}{71757}for the Mr.Julius Caesar contest.
{71828}{71925}The first quiz|is tomorrow morning.
{71928}{72021}Look at chapter three...|"The Foundation of the Republic."
{72086}{72184}Sedgewick, I'm lending you this book|because I believe in you.
{72243}{72314}I think you could be|at the top of your class...
{72315}{72375}if you wanted to be.
{72419}{72518}It's entirely up to you.
{73710}{73768}Begin.
{74509}{74567}Well done!
{74654}{74712}Mr. Bell.
{74805}{74863}You passed.
{74865}{74941}It's only a C-minus.
{74949}{75016}Well, you know what they say|about Rome.
{75019}{75077}It wasn't built in a day?
{75080}{75137}No. All roads lead to it.
{75140}{75242}You were right the first time.|Keep up the good work.
{75463}{75522}Begin.
{75855}{75947}Hey, Kevin! How are you?
{76245}{76311}Forty?|- Fourteen!
{76313}{76390}What are you saying?|- Oh, 14.
{76393}{76456}All right. Alea jacta est.|What's that mean?
{76458}{76520}"The die is cast."
{76654}{76722}All right. All right. Twenty.|All right. Next week then.
{76725}{76799}I actually made the list.|Hey, look who's up there.
{76859}{76918}Good job. Number five.|You're third.
{77349}{77462}Miss Peters, no one is going to look|at this book between now and 7:00 a.m.
{77464}{77524}I understand that, Mr. Bell.|I understand.
{77527}{77662}Every boy in the third forum has asked|to check this book out overnight.
{77665}{77734}Now, if I let you have it,|that wouldn't be fair, would it?
{77737}{77808}I t would be fair.|I know in my heart it would be.
{77811}{77907}Mr. Bell, you are exasperating.|Miss Peters,...
{77909}{77969}that is a great hairstyle.
{77972}{78043}Is that new?|- I've had it since 1958.
{78046}{78147}Now, Mr. Bell, in order to be fair|to all the students,
{78149}{78245}it is important that this book always|be available here at this desk.
{78247}{78307}It is Saint Benedict's policy.
{78310}{78386}And it will be on your desk|tomorrow morning.
{78389}{78447}I promise you.|You have my word.
{78449}{78527}No! No!
{78529}{78614}Miss Peters, I can vouch|for this boy's character.
{78617}{78675}He's one of my best students.
{78678}{78754}If he says it will be on your desk|first thing in the morning,...
{78756}{78844}it will be on your desk|first thing in the morning.
{78847}{78925}I will, personally,|take full responsibility.
{79049}{79107}Please.
{79180}{79238}Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{79240}{79292}I wasn't kidding|about the hair.
{79294}{79346}Thank you. Good night.|Say thank you.
{79347}{79426}Thank you.|Thanks. Good evening.
{79428}{79493}You run a tight ship, Miss Peters.|Good night.
{79495}{79615}Good night! Good night!|- I admire that...
{79724}{79798}Come on, Sedge.|Come on.
{79799}{79878}Yeah-yeah. Come on.|Pick it up. Pick it up.
{79880}{79938}All right, Marty!
{79940}{80019}Nice! Nice catch!
{80161}{80277}Hey, Mr. Hundert!|Hey, you want to take a couple of swings?
{80279}{80344}Come on, Mr. Hundert!
{80347}{80422}Aw, come on!|- Come on, Mr. Hundert!
{80425}{80504}The library windows are too close.
{80506}{80580}Oh, yeah.|Right, Mr. Hundert.
{80583}{80655}Hey, come on. Show us|how it's done, old school.
{80722}{80838}Now you got to play,|Mr. Hundert. Come on!
{80901}{80956}"Old school," eh?
{80969}{81037}Here we go.|Here comes the jacket.
{81040}{81131}Watch and learn.
{81242}{81311}Mr. Masoudi.|Mr. Hundert.
{81313}{81388}It's been awhile.|- Yeah. More like never.
{81451}{81548}Hey, back it up, everybody. Come on.|We got a hitter. Move back.
{81550}{81620}Back it up, fellows.|Back it up, out field.
{81621}{81675}Should've known.
{81735}{81829}Egemus iaculatore,|non iacchi latore!
{81831}{81950}What does that mean?|- Means we want a pitcher, not a glass of water.
{82016}{82109}Come on, Sedgewick!|You got to get him back for that one!
{82111}{82186}Right down the lane!
{82197}{82273}No batter.
{82435}{82524}All right! No batter! Come on!|Sedgewick, come on.
{82525}{82631}Swing, batter-batter-batter-batter!
{83117}{83162}Run!
{83177}{83219}Run!
{83399}{83469}Come on!|Hurry, up!
{83471}{83539}Move! Move! Come on! Move it!|Let's go!
{83659}{83718}Hey, come on!|Let's go to Brewster's room!
{83719}{83778}Go, go, go!
{84057}{84117}Nice hit, Mr. Hundert.
{84118}{84220}Good, Mr. H.|"Old school"!
{84223}{84308}I suppose you're as blind|as all of them.
{84310}{84383}You have no idea how this came to be hit|through my window? - No idea.
{84386}{84446}Oh, dear.|- No idea?
{84448}{84554}Ohhh, dear.|- You'll make a good lawyer.
{84775}{84855}It's 9:00.|You have until noon.
{84857}{84943}This is the last of|the Mr.Julius Caesar quizzes...
{84945}{85018}and will do much to determine|the three finalists.
{85020}{85086}Good luck.
{87019}{87091}It's time, Mr. Bell.
{87248}{87371}Mr. Bell,|I'm afraid you'll have to stop.
{91390}{91461}This is it, Martin.
{91803}{91907}This is unbelievable!|- Oh, my God. I got to call my father.
{92436}{92494}All right. Let's go!
{93117}{93180}Oh, I'm sorry,.|I hope it's not too late.
{93181}{93240}No. Not at all.|Not at all.
{93242}{93305}How are you?
{93307}{93366}Well. Well.|I was just outside...
{93368}{93426}observing the wildlife.
{93428}{93487}Sit down!|Would you like your usual?
{93489}{93548}No, thank you.|You sure?
{93551}{93630}Do you mind if I, uh...
{93632}{93697}How is Mr. Julius Caesar going?
{93699}{93829}Very... Very well.|Even, uh, Sedgewick Bell.
{93831}{93922}Making progress?|- Oh, more than progress.
{93923}{94029}He's come out of the darkness|into the light. It's...
{94031}{94090}Please, sit down.
{94170}{94230}Cheers.
{94247}{94305}I have to tell you something.
{94307}{94429}Tony's been offered a lectureship|at his old college in Oxford.
{94432}{94519}It's a good offer,|and he's accepted it.
{94532}{94597}I mean... I mean to say|we've accepted it.
{94600}{94694}Uh, we're going to England.
{94696}{94771}When?
{94774}{94831}At the end of the year?
{94833}{94908}Well, if he wants the position,...
{94910}{94991}he has to take it up almost immediately,|and he wants the position.
{94993}{95066}So, he's spoken|to Mr. Woodbridge,...
{95068}{95133}and he agreed.
{95223}{95281}Just like that?
{95283}{95347}Well, that's... that's...
{95413}{95528}That's remarkable, really.
{95529}{95614}A lectureship, that's|a tremendous opportunity.
{95616}{95706}Very good. Good.
{95962}{96026}Well, you'll be missed.
{96062}{96120}Both of you.
{96122}{96212}I-I... I should...
{96227}{96300}Yes.
{97308}{97367}Deepak!
{97369}{97448}Yea, Louis!
{97591}{97701}Sedgewick!|- Yea, Louis!
{97832}{97896}Masoudi!
{97984}{98045}Welcome...|Welcome, everyone,...
{98048}{98162}to the 73rd annual competition|of Mr. Julius Caesar.
{98163}{98295}Our congratulations go|to Messrs. Louis Masoudi,
{98357}{98455}Deepak Mehta...|- Deepak!
{98458}{98524}and Sedgewick Bell.
{98759}{98844}Of course, this competition,|this year's event,...
{98845}{98927}would not have been possible if|it hadn't been for the passion...
{98929}{98993}of our moderator.
{98995}{99124}I give you|our learned Mr. Hundert.
{99127}{99180}Mr. H.!
{99346}{99440}Headmaster. Gentlemen.
{99442}{99527}Ladies. Distinguished guests.
{99530}{99617}Questions will be posed|to our three young scholars...
{99620}{99677}in increasing levels|of difficulty.
{99680}{99748}I ask you all to please|hold your applause...
{99749}{99808}till the end|of each round.
{99809}{99889}May the best man win.

{100194}{100267}only to garner|even greater power?
{100268}{100334}Augustus, right?
{100337}{100382}Correct.

{103486}{103547}Correct.|Thank you, Mr. Masoudi.

{103927}{104017}Mr. Bell, which general...
{104020}{104088}had the support|of the aristocrats...

{104966}{105016}Sulla.
{105096}{105161}Lucius Cornelius Sulla.
{105319}{105402}That is correct.
{105404}{105512}That's my boy!
{105617}{105704}Mr. Woodbridge, I think|Sedgewick Bell is cheating.
{105747}{105805}Let it go.|What?
{105807}{105895}Ignore it.
{105897}{105978}Ignore it?|Ignore it.

{107125}{107194}Excuse me?|How many?
{107197}{107256}Fourteen.|- That is correct.

{107793}{107862}Mr. Bell,...
{107909}{107983}who was Hamilcar Barca?
{108363}{108449}Would you repeat|the question, please?
{108451}{108566}Who was Hamilcar Barca?
{108983}{109036}I don't know.
{109383}{109453}Mr. Mehta,|who was Hamilcar Barca?
{109456}{109606}The Carthaginian general victorious|in the battle of Drepana in 249.
{109608}{109731}An unequaled commander with the|misfortune of being on the wrong side.
{109734}{109818}That is correct.
{110325}{110396}Thank you, Louis.|Thank you.
{110653}{110711}Mr. Julius Caesar.
{111210}{111297}Harrison, how's your sister?|You better not speak to her.
{111298}{111385}Mr. H., good job, man.|Good job, Mr. Hundert.
{111418}{111482}Hey,Jeremy! How you doin'?
{111934}{112041}That was quite an interesting performance|this afternoon.
{112043}{112108}I knew you saw.
{112572}{112688}Why, Sedgewick?
{112690}{112752}You knew the material.
{112754}{112839}Why not?
{112997}{113092}How come you didn't stand up|and call me out?
{113124}{113216}It's a complicated matter,|Sedgewick.
{113288}{113364}It wasn't because|of my father, was it?
{113448}{113528}It had nothing to do|with your father.
{113645}{113763}Sure, Mr. Hundert.|Sure.
{114570}{114652}William!
{114654}{114745}I came by to congratulate you.|That was terrific!
{114748}{114844}Sedgewick Bell... quite the surprise.|Yes.
{114846}{114950}He's come a long way.|You must be very proud of him.
{114953}{115013}It makes for wonderful theater.
{115014}{115121}In fact, I was thinking, I might make the|suggestion to you, and to Mr. Woodbridge,
{115123}{115182}that in the future|more alumni are invited.
{115183}{115308}Not just the parents of the finalists,|but maybe all of the alumni.
{115309}{115380}You know? And instead of it happening|just on any old weekday,...
{115381}{115471}think about making it|a weekend event.
{115472}{115567}You know, for fund-raising, which would|augurwell for your headmastership.
{115568}{115697}What's wrong?
{115838}{115935}Sedgewick cheated.
{115936}{115996}What?|Come in.
{116075}{116171}Well, the pressure to succeed|can be oppressive.
{116173}{116231}And, right or wrong,
{116233}{116342}Woodbridge felt it was in the best interests|of the school's endowment to let it pass.
{116345}{116424}Come on. William, you didn't|put the boy up on the stage.
{116426}{116485}He got there|on his own merit.
{116486}{116546}All you did was inspire him...
{116549}{116658}to study and to learn, and for that|you should be commended.
{117195}{117284}And thus began|an uneasy truce...
{117286}{117371}between Sedgewick Bell|and myself.
{117374}{117474}Whatever spark had ignited him|during the previous months...
{117477}{117539}was now extinguished.
{117541}{117613}And his brief flirtation|with diligence...
{117616}{117703}was supplanted by|a renewed appetite for brashness,
{117706}{117781}contempt and folly.
{117827}{117972}As for his classmates,|his effect on them was almost hypnotic.
{117974}{118032}Wherever he went,|they hovered,
{118034}{118105}Sedgewick for class president. utterly|blind to any deficiencies in his character.
{118107}{118166}Food fight!
{118168}{118240}So, his remaining years at|Saint Benedict's passed...
{118243}{118333}a midst an inexhaustible series|of pranks,
{118335}{118408}and an avalanche|of C's and D's.
{118409}{118488}Sedgewick Hyram Bel I.
{118491}{118577}And though his father's influence|guaranteed him a place at Yale,...
{118634}{118703}it was with a|profound sense of failure,
{118706}{118809}that in the spring of 1976,
{118811}{118950}I handed|Sedgewick Bell his diploma.
{119713}{119783}According to Heraclitus,
{119786}{119865}we cannot step into|the same river twice.
{119867}{119927}"In the flow of time,"|he argued,
{119930}{120024}"an opportunity lost|is lost forever."
{120127}{120260}And yet, when Elizabeth 's marriage ended|and she returned home from England,...
{120262}{120332}the waters in which|we found ourselves swimming...
{120335}{120510}were precisely as lovely|as those we had earlier only imagined.
{120512}{120585}But if time had made|concessions for love,...
{120587}{120660}it made none for death.
{120662}{120743}And when our headmaster,|Terence Woodbridge, passed away,
{120745}{120820}I felt profound sadness.
{120823}{120932}Though the incident with Sedgewick Bell|had tested our friendship,...
{120934}{120994}he had for half a century,...
{120997}{121147}devoted himself to St. Benedict's tradition|of academic and moral leadership...
{121149}{121238}A tradition, I realized,|that was now mine...
{121240}{121301}to safeguard.
{121892}{121950}Good luck, Mr. Hundert.
{121952}{122028}Thank you, Mr. Horner.
{122066}{122145}Everyone.|Welcome.
{122148}{122215}Larry, good to see you.
{122217}{122338}Hi.|Mr. Phillips.
{122341}{122404}Mr. Hundert.|Good to see you again.
{122407}{122465}Uh, please take a seat.
{122468}{122534}Let's get right to it, shall we?
{122536}{122651}As you wish.
{122654}{122763}Mr. Hundert, your contributions at Saint|Benedict's have been extraordinary.
{122765}{122867}Your tenure is unmatched,|and you are loved and revered by all.
{122869}{122959}The notion of taking you away|from your classroom...
{122962}{123030}is one to which|we've given great thought.
{123032}{123102}A headmaster's job|is a rigorous one.
{123104}{123199}The travel demands and meeting schedules|have become unending.
{123202}{123314}One must be prepared to do battle|24 hours a day and sometimes longer.
{123317}{123415}Well, having rowedourlake|every,day, weatherpermitting,
{123417}{123500}through the last seven|presidential administrations,
{123502}{123577}I feel more than ready|to do battle.
{123700}{123770}What we're saying,|Mr. Hundert, is...
{123844}{123934}Mr. Hundert,|what experience do you have...
{123936}{124044}with fund-raising|or building endowments?
{124047}{124140}Mr. Hundert, we can't afford|to lose you as a teacher here.
{124143}{124228}The reality is this.|Enrollment is down.
{124229}{124318}People are thinking|of Saint Benedict's as old-fashioned.
{124319}{124446}We need to look more to the future|and less to the past.
{124601}{124698}Then who?
{124735}{124802}Someone from the outside?
{124805}{124880}James Ellerby.
{124941}{125000}Excuse me?
{125001}{125085}You did realize he made|application for the job.
{125087}{125162}Mr. Ellerby has proposed some very, exciting...|- No.
{125163}{125269}fund-raising possibilities.
{125363}{125459}Miss Johnston, I've been|assistant headmaster for 17 years.
{125461}{125524}I fail to see how Mr. Ellerby's...
{125525}{125584}qualifications as a fund-raiser--
{125585}{125644}It's not just|about fund-raising.
{125646}{125750}James Ellerby is|a forward-thinking man.
{125753}{125810}He's reached out|to the community.
{125813}{125915}He's built relationships to some|of the most important alumni.
{125917}{125990}He is a wonderful communicator,
{125993}{126050}with impeccable|moral standing...
{126053}{126150}and an unwavering|commitment to this school.
{126185}{126242}So...
{126312}{126382}Then you leave me no choice|but to tender my resignation.
{126385}{126495}I would ask you not to.
{126496}{126578}You are a teacher, and|the finest one we've ever had.
{126638}{126695}Please excuse me.
{126698}{126824}Please understand, Mr. Hundert, you will be|welcome back here at Saint Benedict's at any time.
{126826}{126911}The door will forever be open.
{128532}{128590}I'm still shocked|at James Ellerby.
{128592}{128730}Oh, I'm not. I'm only shocked|that I didn't see it coming.
{128732}{128852}I realize now he'd been conducting a|behind-the-scenes campaign for years.
{128855}{129009}He's godfather to two of the board|members' children, for God's sake.
{129078}{129151}I have...
{129153}{129221}so many other things...
{129223}{129293}that I've always|wanted to do.
{129296}{129354}I've always wanted to write.
{129356}{129461}I have an idea for a book on|the early days of the Republic.
{129464}{129541}Well,...
{129544}{129613}here's to Saint Benedict's.
{130044}{130111}I brought you some tea.
{130173}{130230}Going well?
{130232}{130311}Oh, it's virtually|writing itself.
{130314}{130405}Good.|Then I won't interrupt you.
{130407}{130511}Carry,on, then.|Good writing.
{131529}{131616}William?
{131618}{131700}James Ellerby's on the phone.
{131702}{131851}The merger makes him C.E.O. of one of|the largest corporations in America.
{131852}{131971}But what does any of this|have to do with me?
{131972}{132039}Here's the thing. He's informed|us that he would like to make...
{132041}{132112}a substantial donation|to Saint Benedict's...
{132114}{132172}with one condition.
{132174}{132278}He would like to hold a rematch of the|Mr. Julius Caesar contest.
{132280}{132346}A rematch?
{132348}{132415}With you|as master of ceremonies.
{132418}{132488}Why?
{132491}{132548}He says he would like to|reclaim his intellectual honor.
{132551}{132666}And he says his secretary,'s already located|Louis Masoudi and Deepak Mehta...
{132668}{132755}and doesn't really anticipate too much|trouble tracking down the others.
{132756}{132831}Didn't you tell him|I had retired?
{132834}{132919}Well, he asked|for you and only you.
{132920}{132996}He insisted on it|as a condition.
{132997}{133173}And did Mr. Bell say how much of a donation|he was planning to make to Saint Benedict's?
{133176}{133286}Enough for a 25,000-square-foot|addition to the library...
{133288}{133347}in honor of his father.
{133348}{133437}It would be the school's|single largest donation to date.
{133438}{133611}And a retired history professor with no|fund-raising ability is the linchpin.
{133617}{133696}Yes.
{133698}{133770}It's ironic.
{133773}{133835}Life's a funny thing,|William, huh?
{133837}{133916}Where does he propose|to hold this rematch?
{133919}{134032}A resort on the Gold Coast of Long Island|that his company owns.
{134034}{134091}The proposed itinerary,|is all in here.
{135675}{135733}Ah, Mr. Hundert.
{135735}{135795}Mr. Bell.
{135798}{135865}And how was your trip?
{135867}{135925}It was unlike anything|I 've ever experienced.
{135927}{136024}I now know how Caesar Augustus|must have felt...
{136025}{136101}being carried head high in the litter past the Tiber.|- Oh, really?
{136103}{136190}It's all a bit overwhelming.
{136192}{136295}Well, don't let this fool you.|I am still the son ofa pig farmer.
{136298}{136425}I really appreciate|you coming here this weekend.
{136427}{136527}You know, you think things that happen|when you're 15 don't matter, but...
{137128}{137230}Great party.|I'm so glad to see you.
{137233}{137315}I mean, this guy...|you should have saw him in boarding school.
{137318}{137386}I mean, oh... Excuse me, guys,|I'll be right back.
{137427}{137484}Mr. Hundert. Please.
{137487}{137553}Sedgewick.|Please come and join us.
{137555}{137637}I'd like you to meet my top two advisors.|This is John.
{137639}{137697}Hi, John.|Hi, Mr. Hundert.
{137699}{137759}And Robert.|- How do you do, Mr. Hundert?
{137761}{137885}Very well, thank you.|- And, my lovely wife, Victoria.
{137887}{138001}So nice to finally meet you, sir.|I've heard so much about you.
{138002}{138100}All right, all right!
{138102}{138161}This is the time of the evening...
{138163}{138243}where I'd like to|call upon a unique g...
{138246}{138339}Oh, Brewster.
{138387}{138451}I'd like to call upon|a unique gentleman,...
{138453}{138582}one who managed to chisel the rise and|fall of the Roman Empire into our minds,...
{138583}{138674}whether we liked it or not.
{138676}{138763}Our Mr. Hundert.|- Hear! Hear!
{138941}{139047}I must say, um...|You've all grown up.
{139049}{139151}I feel as if|I should do roll call...
{139153}{139207}just to be sure|to whom I'm speaking.
{139209}{139316}Seriously,|to stand here among...
{139319}{139386}my students...
{139573}{139631}I expect to see|you all in detention.
{139693}{139774}Now, risen to become...
{139776}{139880}a bunch|of drunken reprobates...
{139938}{140037}who are now a veritable|who's who of American industry,
{140039}{140127}Law, finance|and higher education.
{140129}{140260}Well, I can think|of few greater privileges.
{140262}{140320}I thank you.
{140445}{140525}More coffee, sir?|- Yes. Thank you.
{140661}{140762}Mr. Hundert?
{140849}{140995}Martin. Martin Blythe.
{140997}{141078}It's good|to see you again, sir.
{141079}{141175}When you weren't at the dinner last night,|I was worried that perhaps...
{141177}{141241}That I wasn't gonna make it?
{141243}{141317}Oh, come on, Mr. Hundert.|I wouldn't miss this.
{141320}{141377}You know, I was going|over my notes the other day...
{141380}{141451}in preparation for the...|- The competition.
{141453}{141539}Yes, and I-I came|across an essay...
{141542}{141662}that you once wrote|on the Five Good Emperors.
{141664}{141725}It's amazing.|You were...
{141728}{141796}You were always|a wonderful student, Martin.
{141797}{141856}I, uh,...
{141857}{141964}I never quite|gave you your due.
{141965}{142048}Now, why would you say that?
{142050}{142156}Oh, I don't know, I...
{142158}{142250}My God, Mr. Hundert, you...
{142253}{142374}That recommendation you wrote|when I applied for the Academy...
{142376}{142498}It was glowing. It was...
{142501}{142590}Of course|you gave me my due.
{142592}{142653}You gave me|more than my due.
{142743}{142826}Grab his wrists! Push.
{142828}{142893}Okay, Deepak. With what emperor did the|Julio-Claudian dynasty come to an end?
{142894}{142953}Masoudi?
{142954}{143026}Nero.
{143027}{143162}We did it! Yeah! Good job, Robert.|All right, all right.
{143164}{143221}Time to study.
{143224}{143335}No. Come on, Dad!|One more game?
{143599}{143676}Come in.
{143678}{143761}Sorry, to bother you, sir.|- Oh, no bother.
{143762}{143821}How are you, Sedgewick?|- I am fine.
{143823}{143917}I have something for you.
{143919}{143977}Oh, my God.
{143979}{144092}I hope there's no late fee.
{144094}{144207}I understand now|why it meant so much to you.
{144251}{144374}"The Greeks carve cold marble|until it almost comes to life.
{144376}{144461}"The Greeks compose|great orations...
{144464}{144551}"and measure the heavens so well they|can predict the rising of the stars.
{144552}{144645}"But you, Roman,|remember your great arts.
{144647}{144718}"To govern the people|with authority...
{144720}{144796}"to establish peace|under the rule oflaw.
{144798}{144925}To conquer the mighty, and to show them|mercy once they are conquered."
{145113}{145227}Well, it's nice to see|you haven't marked it up.
{145269}{145347}Yeah, I had my moments, didn't I?
{145348}{145441}Your years, you mean.
{145443}{145549}Why did you put up with me?
{145609}{145672}I suppose because...
{145674}{145817}I saw a young man who was|under a great deal of pressure.
{145820}{145901}And, not unlike your up bringing,
{145903}{146038}I too had a... a father|who was a very busy man.
{146099}{146174}You know, it's funny.
{146177}{146257}I remember traveling|with my father,...
{146260}{146324}and there wasn't a person|he didn't know.
{146325}{146413}He talked, and he told stories,|and he was,...
{146415}{146531}he was always full of advice,|always charming, and always...
{146532}{146590}the Senator.
{146592}{146707}But I can hardly remember having|a real conversation with him.
{146709}{146795}In fact, I wonder if he ever|heard a word I'd spoken.
{146872}{147011}Years ago, I, uh,...
{147014}{147108}visited him in the hospital|and he was very, very sick.
{147110}{147223}And it took a moment for him|to realize I was at his bedside.
{147288}{147391}And he began to cry.
{147393}{147460}And through his tears,|he looked up at me and he said,
{147589}{147670}"Talk to me."
{147843}{147935}I wondered where to begin.|I had no idea.
{147972}{148090}But at the very, moment|I started to talk,
{148126}{148250}he closed his eyes|and he passed away...
{148297}{148436}without having heard a word.
{148520}{148577}Ah, that son of a bitch.
{148762}{148840}Oh, God. Thanks.|Thanks again, Mr. Hundert,...
{148842}{148940}for, uh, for making|all this possible.
{148943}{149000}It is my extreme pleasure.
{149003}{149067}I'm looking forward|to this evening. Best of luck.
{149070}{149165}Oh, much obliged.|I'll need all the help I can get.
{149167}{149227}I don't think so.
{149229}{149311}See ya downstairs.|I'll see you downstairs.
{149699}{149759}Go, Deepak!
{149813}{149877}All right, Sedgewick!
{150269}{150362}It's not a good time. I've gotta|call you right back. Thank you. Bye.
{150365}{150422}Sorry, sir.
{150425}{150507}Were you talking to your broker?
{150625}{150686}Good evening,|ladies and gentlemen.
{150688}{150776}Our three scholars|will be posed questions...
{150777}{150866}on ancient history|in increasing levels of difficulty.
{150867}{150974}I ask you to please hold your applause|until the end of each round.
{150976}{151041}May the best man win.
{151193}{151252}Mr. Masoudi, are you ready?
{151253}{151312}Mr. Hundert,|I am Julius Caesar.

{152320}{152384}No.|- Oh. Septimus?
{152386}{152474}Nope.|- Gaseous Flatulus?
{152548}{152606}I'm sorry,.|None of the above.
{152610}{152698}The question goes to Mr. Mehta.|Would you like me to repeat the question?
{152700}{152773}No, sir. It's Claudius, sir.|- That is correct.
{152776}{152833}See, I knew that.|- It was a short reign, but a happy one.

{153273}{153411}please translate, if you will,|alea jacta est.
{153414}{153495}Tell me who uttered these words,|and on what occasion.
{153498}{153627}Alea jacta est.|"The die is cast."
{153629}{153731}Caesar spoke these words as he crossed|the Rubicon in defiance of his government.

{157319}{157386}I'm gonna take a stab here.

{158070}{158178}Thank you very much.|Good. I'm...

{160770}{160823}Come on, Sedgewick.
{160896}{160954}The plaque!
{161123}{161202}I guess if Deepak|can nab this one,...
{161203}{161297}then it's his ball game.
{161522}{161608}Mr. Mehta,|who was Shutruk-Nahhunte?
{161611}{161715}Shutruk-Nahhunte,|King of Ansham and Susa,

{162795}{162933}Thank you very much, Mr. Hundert.|Good job.
{162936}{163021}I suppose if you're gonna lose,|you may as well lose to the brightest.
{163023}{163095}Deepak Mehta.
{163175}{163267}And thanks again, Mr. Hundert.
{163269}{163373}Your virtue is|a beacon of light.
{163376}{163479}All right, Mr. H.!
{163481}{163572}Oh, no, Mr. Hundert.|Please stay.
{163607}{163673}And thank you all.
{163675}{163733}We've had a great deal|of fun this weekend,
{163735}{163843}and we, uh, probably shouldn't wait|another 25 years till we do it again.
{163846}{163925}I'll say.
{163927}{164049}But there's a more serious side|to this gathering.
{164052}{164111}One that concerns|every, one of us.
{164112}{164187}Because all of us here,|I believe,...
{164190}{164264}care about the quality|of education in this country,.
{164266}{164358}And not just at places|Iike Saint Benedict's,...
{164360}{164456}not just for our children,...
{164458}{164591}but for the nation's children.
{164594}{164699}Because we all care about|our country's future...
{164702}{164759}Marty...
{164762}{164828}about its moral leadership,...
{164830}{164923}about its fiscal leadership.
{164926}{165048}And because we know that,|as a generation,...
{165051}{165109}it is our time to lead.
{165245}{165319}And why I stand before you now,...
{165322}{165445}to tell you my intentions of following|in the formidable footsteps of my father,...
{165447}{165559}andannounce my bid for a seat|in the United States Senate.
{165561}{165676}And I want to ask you all|for your support.
{165740}{165811}He's got my vote!
{165813}{165915}Congratulations.|Sedgewick, congratulations.
{166700}{166758}Here you are.
{166760}{166861}There's about, uh, 30 balding, middle-aged|men out there looking for you, Professor.
{166915}{166999}Well, some things can't wait.
{167109}{167173}God, you were great|this evening.
{167174}{167281}You're like fine wine.|You improve with age.
{167405}{167469}Everything all right?
{167471}{167532}Yes, I'm fine.|Yeah? You don't...
{167535}{167661}You don't look so fine.|- I'm all right. Thank you.
{167716}{167790}Well, then hurry up|and come join the celebration.
{167878}{167975}How long have you been|hard of hearing, Sedgewick?
{168249}{168338}Very good, Mr. Hundert.|Very...
{168340}{168481}Very good. Yeah.
{168483}{168568}Boy, I thought|you might've known.
{168631}{168711}Who's the poor mercenary|who was feeding you the answers?
{168712}{168854}Oh, just some graduate student.|Gave him a couple hundred bucks and a warm meal.
{168856}{168954}I trust you'll keep this between us.
{168957}{169014}As always.
{169057}{169133}I trust you will.
{169208}{169342}Do you mean am I going|to go out there...
{169344}{169428}and expose you|for a liar and a cheat?
{169430}{169488}No.
{169521}{169580}I'm a teacher, Sedgewick.
{169581}{169694}And I failed you...
{169695}{169783}As a teacher.
{169785}{169863}But I will give you one last lecture,
{169865}{169928}if I may.
{169930}{169988}All of us,...
{169990}{170099}at some point,|are forced...
{170102}{170177}to look at ourselves|in the mirror,...
{170180}{170253}and see who we really are.
{170255}{170335}And when that day|comes for you, Sedgewick,...
{170338}{170429}you will be confronted|with a life...
{170431}{170495}Iived without virtue,...
{170497}{170624}without principle,...
{170627}{170700}and for that I pity you.
{170702}{170760}End of lesson.
{170864}{170963}Well, can I say,|Mr. Hundert,...
{170965}{171022}who gives a shit?
{171025}{171082}Honestly.
{171085}{171192}Who out there|gives a shit...
{171194}{171311}about your principles|and your virtues?
{171313}{171395}I mean, look at you.
{171398}{171458}What do you have|to show for yourself?
{171532}{171655}I live in the real world, where people do|what they need to do to get what they want.
{171658}{171750}And if it's lying and it's cheating,|then so be it.
{171753}{171823}So, I am gonna go out there,...
{171826}{171906}and I am going to win|that election, Mr. Hundert,...
{171908}{171972}and you will|see me everywhere.
{172044}{172103}And I'll worry|about my contribution later.
{172371}{172431}Robert.
{172527}{172585}Robert.
{173698}{173788}And a, uh, vodka tonic, please.|- Yes, sir.
{173841}{173937}Oh, Mr. Hundert.|Martin, could I have a minute?
{173939}{174017}Oh, sure, sure.|I enjoyed that so much, sir.
{174020}{174116}I'm so sorry my wife and my kids|couldn't be here to see it.
{174118}{174188}You know, I really thought Sedgewick was|gonna take it from him this time.
{174190}{174280}It was amazing. Martin, that was|supposed to be you up there.
{174282}{174359}I'm... sorry?
{174361}{174419}All those years ago,...
{174421}{174486}it was supposed to be you.
{174531}{174636}Well, no. I wasn't one of|the original three finalists.
{174638}{174766}You were.|I gave your spot away.
{174835}{174948}It may not mean|anything to you, but...
{174950}{175020}I wanted you to know that.
{175072}{175130}Okay.
{175132}{175203}I'm sorry, Martin.
{175248}{175310}No, that's-that's okay.
{175405}{175479}I-I don't know|what I'm supposed to say.
{175523}{175618}Um, I've got to, um...
{175620}{175679}You know,|Deepak is waiting for me.
{175781}{175869}Will I see you|at breakfast tomorrow?
{175871}{175928}Sure.
{175981}{176039}Good.
{177004}{177105}And here's the key|you were looking for.
{177107}{177179}That's... That's very,|important to us.
{177180}{177269}I think it should be important|to people in our country,.
{177313}{177372}I think that it's...|it's important.
{177373}{177497}My father, Hyram Bell, instilled in me|a sense of principles.
{177499}{177569}What I think|this country really needs,...
{177571}{177642}it's that sense of...|of right and wrong.
{177644}{177756}And we're, uh, speaking of,|of how we can make this...
{177758}{177842}better with education,|to-to reach out...
{177843}{177902}and really get|to the children,...
{177903}{177976}to teach them the sense...
{177979}{178079}of principles|and sense of contribution.
{178324}{178382}Mr. Hundert.
{178384}{178451}Have I come to the wrong place|for breakfast?
{178453}{178585}Not at all. But unfortunately|you've missed everyone.
{178588}{178664}Missed everyone?|Well, they seemed to be rather in a hurry.
{178667}{178724}Some of them|had planes to catch.
{178727}{178802}But they did say|to say good-bye to you.
{178805}{178908}I'm sure I could find you|something to eat if you'd like.
{178910}{178971}No, no. Thank you.
{178974}{179077}Was there... Thank you.
{179407}{179489}Hail, Caesar!
{179969}{180031}Get a picture really quick.|There it is.
{180034}{180120}Look at him.|He looks great.
{180122}{180196}Oh, the bat!|Gimme the bat, the bat.
{180198}{180287}Mr. Hundert, we have something|we'd like to present to you.
{180289}{180354}The only man|who could make Homer a hit,
{180356}{180427}our slugger, Mr. Hundert.
{180435}{180492}Do you remember?
{180494}{180589}I remember. Hey, be careful of|the window over there, Mr. H.!
{180591}{180740}Eloquently put, Mr. Masoudi, et al.|Uh, thank you.
{180742}{180825}Deepak, the, uh,|the, uh, plaque.
{180894}{180982}"A great teacher has little|external history to record.
{180984}{181073}"His life goes over|into other lives.
{181076}{181192}"These men are pillars in the intimate|structure of our schools.
{181194}{181279}"They are more essential|than its stones or beams.
{181281}{181356}"And they will continue|to be a kindling force,...
{181359}{181441}and a revealing power|in our lives."
{181444}{181516}Thank you, Mr. Hundert.
{181518}{181599}Thank you, Deepak.
{181602}{181706}I, uh...
{181769}{181858}He's speechless for the first time|in his life.
{181932}{182003}Whatever I may have|taught you gentlemen,...
{182005}{182073}um, many years ago,...
{182075}{182133}I want to thank you|for this weekend,...
{182135}{182229}because you|have taught me something...
{182231}{182310}of inestimable value.
{182312}{182408}Thank you.
{182410}{182496}To Mr. Hundert.|To you, sir!
{182499}{182595}To Mr. H.!
{182597}{182689}Thank you. Here.|Oh, I'm sorry.
{182692}{182749}To you.
{182814}{182938}I had come here in the hope that I had|been wrong about Sedgewick Bell.
{182939}{183015}Or rather,|that I had been right...
{183018}{183115}right to believe in him|all those years ago.
{183117}{183237}But this is a story,|without surprises.
{183240}{183297}As a student of history,,|I could be shocked...
{183300}{183406}neither by his audacity,|nor his success.
{183409}{183466}I had failed Sedgewick.
{183469}{183526}But the worth of a life|is not determined...
{183529}{183640}by a single failure,|or a solitary, success.
{183642}{183761}My other students|taught me that.
{183789}{183848}However much we stumble,
{183850}{183916}it is a teacher's burden|always to hope...
{183918}{184037}that with learning, a boy's|character might be changed.
{184039}{184127}And, so,|the destiny ofa man.
{184290}{184371}Good morning, Mr. Hundert.|Good morning.

{187754}{187827}which you see|over the door behind you?
{188007}{188085}"I am Shutruk-Nahhunte,
{188087}{188148}"King of Ansham and Susa,
{188149}{188230}"sovereign ofthe land of Elam.
{188232}{188291}"I destroyed Sippar,
{188293}{188353}"took the stele of Naram-Sin...
{188356}{188414}"and brought it back to Elam,
{188415}{188520}"where I erected it|as an offering to my god.'
{188522}{188621}Shutruk-Nahhunte, 1158 B.C."
{188750}{188849}Very good.
