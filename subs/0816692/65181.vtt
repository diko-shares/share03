00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,135
<i>Previously on "Imposters"...</i>

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,037
<i>- My God.
- Mazel tov!</i>

3
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:05,505
Yeah, I think we've been robbed.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,440
My wife's car is here, but she's...

5
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,475
I'm worried she's been kidnapped or...

6
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:13,279
<i>Hi, Ez.</i>

7
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:16,883
<i>Credit cards,
the checking account, cash.</i>

8
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:17,928
<i>It's a shock.</i>

9
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:21,020
<i>You will replay every
moment we shared together,</i>

10
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>think about every person
we met along the way.</i>

11
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:26,292
Who the hell are you?

12
00:00:26,328 --> 00:00:27,660
Federal Burro of Investigation.

13
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,162
Did you say "burro"?

14
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,463
Who are you?

15
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:32,198
I am her husband... just like you.

16
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,167
We married the same woman,
and she took us both.

17
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,042
She's out there,
probably working some new guy,

18
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:37,637
looking like some new chick.

19
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:39,539
I'm supposed to fall
in love with this guy?

20
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:42,742
Gary Heller... managing director
of the Pacific Bank and Trust.

21
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,344
<i>I bet his bark is worse than his bite.</i>

22
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,845
That's what the last two girls said.

23
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,858
What do you know about
facial-recognition software?

24
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,416
- So the initial fee is...
- 1,000 American dollars.

25
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>You will never find me.</i>

26
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:59,071
Mr. Heller?

27
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:01,907
Hi. I'm Saffron Keyes.

28
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:10,483
Every few years,
I like to try new places, new faces.

29
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:27,933
Hi. I'm Saffron Keyes.

30
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:31,771
Showtime.

31
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:34,235
He's ready to see you now.

32
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,682
Mr. Heller?

33
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:45,618
Hi.

34
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:48,287
I'm Ms. Keyes. You can call me Saffron.

35
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:51,357
Yes, Ms. Keyes... Saffron.

36
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:55,628
- Please come in. Take a seat.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:57,663
As you know,
I'm looking for a new assistant.

38
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,932
- My job is a very big one.
- Assistant?

39
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,435
I thought I was here to
sell you Girl Scout cookies.

40
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,972
Would you like to try one?
They're very delicious.

41
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,342
You're being funny. You're funny.

42
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,511
- That's good.
- Good. I'm glad I can be funny.

43
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:15,014
I usually get "adorable"
or "cute" or "hot."

44
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:16,515
Blech.

45
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:18,717
Yes, well... Let's see.

46
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:21,153
Philadelphia Savings Bank,
Montclair Insurance.

47
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,621
These are all excellent references.

48
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:24,290
What brings you to Seattle?

49
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:26,959
Well, I guess you can call
me somewhat of a free spirit.

50
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:30,029
Every few years,
I like to try new places, new faces.

51
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:31,730
A free spirit in banking.

52
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,532
I'm not sure that that's a thing.

53
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,401
Don't get me wrong.

54
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,006
I can be quite serious.

55
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:40,139
Funny again.

56
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:41,340
Thanks again.

57
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,976
Boy, if you keep
flattering me like this,

58
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:46,412
who knows what will happen in here?

59
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,863
Excuse me?

60
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:53,163
- Do you think I'm an idiot?
- I was just joking.

61
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:54,765
Do you think you can just waltz in here,

62
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,200
bat your eyelashes, and get this job?

63
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:57,990
- No.
- Do you think I've never f... ed

64
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,992
a pretty girl in my life before?

65
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:02,695
- Mr. Heller, I didn't mean...
- You can leave now.

66
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:08,134
Now!

67
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:18,177
Someone must've really
done a number on you.

68
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:19,945
What did you just say to me?

69
00:03:22,617 --> 00:03:23,682
I said...

70
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,784
whoever broke your heart

71
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,553
must've really done a number on you.

72
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,966
You don't know a damn thing about me.

73
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,256
I know what hurt looks like.

74
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,790
I see it all over you,

75
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,792
and I know how it can harden a person.

76
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:37,029
But you see, I made a choice
to not let it get to me.

77
00:03:37,064 --> 00:03:40,432
And you, mister, well,
you or some people...

78
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:43,802
they let it make them mistrustful...

79
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:46,438
I mean "mistrustable."

80
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:49,942
M-mistrusting...
whatever that stupid word is.

81
00:03:49,977 --> 00:03:51,755
I think it's mistrusting.

82
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:55,614
- Don't you laugh at me.
- I'm not. I'm not.

83
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,783
I swear, Ms. Keyes, I'm not.

84
00:03:57,818 --> 00:04:01,620
I suppose I just... "mistrustabled" you.

85
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:03,455
Right?

86
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:09,428
Look, I may have overreacted,

87
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:13,065
and for that, I apologize.

88
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,667
Apology accepted.

89
00:04:18,272 --> 00:04:20,839
Would you still like to be my assistant?

90
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:23,282
Really?

91
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,046
I thought I totally blew it.

92
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:33,485
You were right about one thing.

93
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,455
I am untrusting.

94
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,490
Professional hazard, let's say.

95
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:41,093
So be loyal.

96
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:42,261
Yeah?

97
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,862
Absolutely.

98
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:48,133
You can count on me.

99
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:52,671
15 months, 2,000 miles,

100
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:54,306
and I finally found her.

101
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,509
5 1/2 weeks and 9 miles,
and I finally found her.

102
00:04:57,545 --> 00:04:59,511
Yeah, I also got my life ripped apart.

103
00:04:59,547 --> 00:05:01,313
And by the way,
the spy shop was my idea,

104
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,015
so I guess I really did find her.

105
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,695
Yeah, but I found you first, bro...
you didn't find me.

106
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:06,652
- I didn't know you existed.
- Exactly.

107
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,487
First I found you,
and now I found Alice.

108
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,689
And now I'm gonna take her
ass back to Scottsdale,

109
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,358
and after a few special nights

110
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:14,526
which remind her of this
thing I do with my pinkie,

111
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:15,694
she's all yours.

112
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,696
Nice. Very classy.

113
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:21,133
What, you don't want
one more night with Ava?

114
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:22,901
There is no Ava.

115
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:26,038
I want to know who she really is.

116
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:27,539
That's her.

117
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:30,142
Thank you. This... this is great.

118
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:33,345
Yeah, but it's all crossed out.

119
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:35,547
Where's the intel on her 20?

120
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,882
Her location.

121
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,717
I have her 20, full address...

122
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:41,387
Take you right to the front door...
all right here.

123
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:45,057
- Can you get it for us, please?
- Relax, man.

124
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:46,825
I'd love to get it for you.
You got $5,000?

125
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,527
- What?
- What?

126
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:51,930
No, no, no, we gave you
$1,000 to find her.

127
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,365
You must be the smart one.

128
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:56,235
And the pretty boy here is the muscle.

129
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,170
$1,000 to find her,

130
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:01,407
$5,000 if you want to see the intel.

131
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,409
- You've got to be joking.
- That's bullshit, man.

132
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:06,612
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

133
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:08,847
I don't do jokes.
See you when you got $5,000.

134
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:10,416
Hey, man, I don't think you...

135
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:11,917
- Whoa!
- Hey, whoa, dude.

136
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,585
Everyone just relax. Everything's fine.

137
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:16,188
If everything in this world is fine,

138
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:18,257
I'd be out of business.

139
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:22,027
You see my titties?

140
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:23,595
Do you see my titties?

141
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,431
- I don't see no titties.
- No, no, no, no.

142
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,277
That's right, bitches,
'cause I ain't your mama.

143
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:31,103
Now, until you have my 5 large,
get the hell out of my store.

144
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:32,404
- Okay.
- Okay.

145
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,006
- We'll do that.
- Okay.

146
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,216
Just throw that down right here.

147
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:45,984
Thanks for the help.

148
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,487
You could use a little upper-body work.

149
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,755
I made a projected inventory,

150
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,224
price-inflation-
towards-reduction chart.

151
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,659
According to my calculations,

152
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:55,305
we should clear 7 to 10 grand,
no problem.

153
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,429
Really? Good. That's great.

154
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,798
Yeah. Just let me
do the selling, all right?

155
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,767
Once I'm on a roll,
try not to get in my way.

156
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:03,013
Yeah, God forbid I should keep you

157
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:04,670
from getting shot in the face.

158
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:06,249
Did you keep me from
getting shot in the face,

159
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:07,439
puppy-dog eyes?

160
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:08,807
That dude's an asshole.

161
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:10,275
He needs to learn a lesson.

162
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,010
Okay, I get it. Just keep your temper.

163
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:13,846
All right, last chance, man.

164
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:15,013
Anything you want to save?

165
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,820
Sell it all.

166
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:23,455
Who wants to buy some goodies?

167
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:24,656
You do.

168
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:26,024
What's up, man?

169
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,660
All right, let's go see this.

170
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:30,662
Five bucks more,
and it's all yours, buddy.

171
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:33,665
All right. Awesome.

172
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,501
Awesome, ladies.

173
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:41,039
That's a good find.

174
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,474
Yes, ma'am.

175
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,276
Enjoy that purse. I'll take it.

176
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:46,845
Thank you very much, ladies.
That is such a beautiful dress.

177
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,714
I think it would look great on you.

178
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:51,061
You know, you can go try it on,
if you'd like, right inside.

179
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:52,284
It's really nice.

180
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,188
Do you like it?

181
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:57,656
I bought you that dress.

182
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:00,058
<i>I know, chéri.</i>

183
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:04,096
Perhaps you want to keep this one.

184
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,867
Little memento, no?

185
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:11,970
- What do you think?
- You look incredible.

186
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,472
You can't not buy it.

187
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:14,502
I'll take it.

188
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:15,422
- Good call.
- How much?

189
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:17,876
Actually, that one's free. Take it.

190
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,412
Are you sure?
Let me give you something for it.

191
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,472
Take it right now, and it's free.

192
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:24,516
Otherwise you can deal with
Glengarry Glen Ross over here.

193
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:27,319
Okay. Well, thanks.

194
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:29,922
You're welcome. Have a good one.

195
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:33,325
Dude, if you let emotion
get in the way of selling...

196
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,660
I bought Ava that dress,

197
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,261
and I needed it gone, so let it go.

198
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,441
- I don't care...
- Let it go.

199
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:40,532
- Fine.
- How we doing?

200
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,536
Well, with 79% of our inventory gone,

201
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:46,538
we have made 12% of our projection.

202
00:08:46,574 --> 00:08:48,073
What the hell?

203
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:49,753
Look, man, I'm used
to selling cars, all right?

204
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:51,743
You overprice, reduce price, sell.
It's simple.

205
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,213
Your weird kitchen stools
aren't exactly making it easy.

206
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:55,414
Yes, of course I remember.

207
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:57,182
I have it right here in my purse.

208
00:08:57,218 --> 00:08:58,750
Look, check out this guy.

209
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:00,853
He's what we call a "beta-alpha."

210
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:03,128
Thinks he's an alpha male,
and he's actually a beta male.

211
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,058
Sounds about right. That's my brother.

212
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:08,460
Hey, man. This is Richard.
He's...

213
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:10,028
helping me with the yard sale.

214
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,130
- Pleasure to meet you, man.
- What's up?

215
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,566
All right, well, back to the wars.

216
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:20,105
What a shitshow, Ez.

217
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,773
You're better than this, man...

218
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:23,775
chasing after Ava or
whatever her name is.

219
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:25,322
I mean, let's get you out of this funk.

220
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:26,778
Don't bother. I'm gonna find her.

221
00:09:26,814 --> 00:09:28,091
I'm gonna straighten things out.

222
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,748
How, by ruining your life even more?

223
00:09:29,783 --> 00:09:31,583
By shitting on your friends and family?

224
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,952
Mom and Dad... they're heartbroken, man.

225
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:36,822
Gaby quit. She's out.

226
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,602
- What even happened there, man?
- It's none of your business.

227
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:39,925
It absolutely is my business.

228
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,171
And now the bank is taking your house.

229
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:42,728
I didn't even ask you to come!

230
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:44,963
Boys, boys! That's enough.

231
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:46,865
Sweetie, can we have a talk?

232
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:51,169
I thought you said "we." I get it.

233
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:53,071
Okay, I'm gonna go look at some stuff.

234
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,606
Come on.

235
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:57,376
So you're really going to just go?

236
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:58,411
I am.

237
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,812
I can't understand it, but I want to.

238
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:02,414
Mom, it's gonna be fine. I promise.

239
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:05,183
Your dad is very upset with you.

240
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:08,453
But... he wants you to have this.

241
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:17,629
- I can't take that.
- Honey, don't be proud.

242
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:19,998
She took all your money.
She took everything.

243
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:21,600
Let us just help you through this.

244
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:23,802
Mom, my whole life
I've been leaning on you.

245
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:25,203
Not anymore.

246
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,005
It's called parenting.

247
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,840
That's what we do.

248
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:31,843
Thank Dad for me, okay?

249
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,446
Okay.

250
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:36,251
My God.

251
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,049
It's Binky.

252
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:41,019
No one else should have this.

253
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:43,622
Can I buy this?
It should stay in the family.

254
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,290
Of course.

255
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:47,626
Okay, good. I'll give you $5,000.

256
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,928
Nice try.

257
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:13,852
Good morning, Mr. Heller.
Nice to see you.

258
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:16,488
I start in kitchen. It's okay?

259
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,051
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

260
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,002
Happy first day.

261
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:35,573
- Mr. Heller?
- Coffee.

262
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,009
Milk and two sugars.

263
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:39,443
Back in a jiffy.

264
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,746
This is Andy,
the youngest member of our team.

265
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:44,148
- And best-looking.
- Till now.

266
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:47,251
I'm Saffron. Nice to meet you.

267
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:48,652
Very nice to meet you, too.

268
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:50,354
Here's Mr. Heller's mail. Good luck.

269
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,956
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

270
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:21,886
I don't know how the hell this happened.

271
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:25,356
Mr. Heller,
I picked these up at lunch for you.

272
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,991
I hope you don't mind.

273
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,562
What the hell is this?

274
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:33,798
That is my goddamn password.

275
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:34,999
Saffron!

276
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:43,207
Mr. Heller, this is Florence Hayes,
our new IT man.

277
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:46,010
Did you turn it off and turn it on?

278
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,713
Good night.

279
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,667
- Good night.
- Good night.

280
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:00,624
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, sir.

281
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:05,029
Whoa, whoa, hey. Hang on, hang on.

282
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:07,231
- I got us. I got us.
- Wow.

283
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,833
Good gods.

284
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:12,036
Well, aren't you
my knight in shining armor?

285
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,604
All right, carefully, this way.

286
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,939
Come on.

287
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:17,308
- So your two-week review is coming up.
- Yeah?

288
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,975
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

289
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,331
<i>The fresher the milk,</i>

290
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,267
the more delicious the cheese will be.

291
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,342
Obviously, it would be best
if you had your own cow.

292
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:27,062
But if you're not willing to
make that sort of commitment,

293
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:28,419
just buy milk and warm it up,

294
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:30,788
but very slowly, on the stovetop.

295
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:32,101
Now, when we come back from break,

296
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,602
I'll go into the different coagulants.

297
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:34,725
Okay, back in ten.

298
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:41,599
- Hi.
- Hey.

299
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,945
I just wanted to return your book.

300
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,635
Thank you.

301
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,637
Josh told me you quit?

302
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:50,274
I did. Yeah, I just needed to
not be surrounded by Blooms

303
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:51,408
all the time.

304
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:53,116
- I can relate to that.
- Yeah.

305
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,477
And now you make cheese?

306
00:13:55,478 --> 00:13:57,882
No, no, it's just... it's a new hobby.

307
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:01,785
Just trying to fill my
head with other thoughts.

308
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,289
Look, Gaby,
I'm so sorry for what happened

309
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:08,893
that night that I, um,
made you talk in an accent.

310
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:11,162
And then told me it
wasn't up to scratch?

311
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:15,099
I actually, like,
really needed a kick in "zee" butt.

312
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:17,268
So thank you.

313
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:20,337
It was a good wake-up call.

314
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,478
I don't think you know this, but...

315
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:30,814
I used to get into
work early every single day

316
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,484
so I could watch you
walk down the street...

317
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,420
sort of see you out in the world.

318
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:40,424
I would imagine that I was
somebody that you didn't know,

319
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,127
and you would accidentally bump into me,

320
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,495
and then we would...

321
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:48,199
Okay, everyone, break's over.

322
00:14:48,234 --> 00:14:50,367
Let's go make cheese.

323
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:55,372
I should get back,
or my curds won't form properly.

324
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:58,142
Yeah, don't let that happen. Sounds bad.

325
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,643
You should keep this.

326
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,356
I underlined passages...
not very subtle...

327
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,282
but I actually think page
35 is more for you now.

328
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,351
- Page 35.
- Yeah.

329
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:10,387
Got it.

330
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,456
Ezra, um...

331
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:15,893
$5,000, that's a bargain.

332
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,363
Binky...
I just thought it was really nice

333
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:21,565
that you let your mom buy it.

334
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,639
Well, look who's here.

335
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:30,140
Where's the pretty one?

336
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,010
I am the pretty one.

337
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,985
- This is $5,000.
- Yes, it is.

338
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,554
I'm pretty damn sure I said $7,500.

339
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,391
I'm pretty damn
sure you said $5,000...

340
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:49,727
- and ""
- What?

341
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,089
Yeah, I thought so.

342
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,899
Knock, knock.

343
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,368
Who's there?

344
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:00,004
My balls, dickhead.

345
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,805
Grab it.

346
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,511
This is where she lives?

347
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,013
Yeah.

348
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:10,581
Pleasure doing business.

349
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,019
Whoo! That's what I'm talking about!

350
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:16,420
That is what I'm talk...

351
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,222
What's up?

352
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:20,057
Yeah, man!

353
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:24,795
My God, come on.

354
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,831
That is disgusting.

355
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:31,035
- Hey.
- Just gonna ditch me?

356
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,803
- What?
- After I found her for you?

357
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:34,271
- I was just getting...
- Bullshit.

358
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:36,240
And you went to my
mother behind my back?

359
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,941
What kind of man does that?

360
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,444
The kind of man who has his
eyes on the mother-effing prize,

361
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,246
who isn't mooning over a red dress,

362
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,614
'cause the way I see it, man,

363
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,582
you either want to
find her or you don't.

364
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:47,451
- I do.
- Then do whatever it takes.

365
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:49,620
I will, but I will not trust you.

366
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:52,389
God. I think I'm gonna cry.

367
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:55,259
- Did you get the intel?
- Yeah.

368
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,294
He wanted more money,
but I took care of it.

369
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,498
- You got, what, gum?
- I did what I had to do.

370
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,634
So are you ready to go find her?

371
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,169
Yeah.

372
00:17:05,204 --> 00:17:06,503
Keys?

373
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:16,914
You know, you could've just
opened the passenger-side door.

374
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,882
I-I know.

375
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:26,290
<i>All right, let's put some tunes on.</i>

376
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,094
<i>You got to be kidding me.</i>

377
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:31,495
<i>- Don't do that.
- What?</i>

378
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,097
<i>Do not be the guy that does not think</i>

379
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:34,676
<i>that Chris Martin has
it all figured out.</i>

380
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,133
<i>My God.</i>

381
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,176
How are you gonna make that?

382
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:49,113
You are worrying way too much.

383
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,115
We're all good.
I have all the logistics.

384
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,950
I have all the data.

385
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:54,496
All we have to do is head
there on Wednesday...

386
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Can I have an espresso
and a croissant, please?

387
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,689
Yeah, do you want it to stay or to go?

388
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,891
How about to stay?

389
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,626
- Hey.
- Hey.

390
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:04,495
That's all right.
I don't want to interrupt.

391
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,364
You're not. I was just leaving.

392
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,366
- So next Friday?
- Yeah.

393
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:14,538
It's a business associate.

394
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:16,140
I didn't ask.

395
00:18:16,175 --> 00:18:18,409
You didn't have to.

396
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:20,711
Come on, why don't you sit
with me for a minute?

397
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:24,019
Princeton... fancy.

398
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:25,958
Well, full disclosure...

399
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:28,761
Princeton was a scholarship
because I was good at math,

400
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:32,364
and math led me to tech,
and then tech led me here.

401
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,133
Following your dreams?

402
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:37,369
More like following
the path of least resistance.

403
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,571
I created an algorithm
for my senior thesis.

404
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:43,375
A few companies out here
became interested, and...

405
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,944
What does the algorithm do?

406
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,147
- You really interested?
- So far.

407
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:49,182
Okay.

408
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:50,916
Well, let's say

409
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:53,786
one day you happen to meet a tall,
good-looking guy

410
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:55,954
that you think you might want to marry.

411
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,589
For the sake of the story.

412
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,957
Well, madame, we've just met,

413
00:18:58,993 --> 00:19:00,626
so this certainly isn't an offer.

414
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,227
Well, give it a minute.

415
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,962
- I'm kidding.
- Touché.

416
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:05,430
Anyway, so you're online.

417
00:19:05,466 --> 00:19:08,167
You're searching for rings and venues,

418
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:11,170
and my algorithm says,
"Hey, someone in here

419
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:14,239
is a romantic, wedding-planning fool."

420
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:16,408
And then companies start
sending you coupons

421
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:18,477
for DJs and honeymoon places.

422
00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:20,179
It kind of helps the marketplace to...

423
00:19:20,214 --> 00:19:23,315
Take advantage of just how
predictable human behavior is.

424
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,818
Well, I mean,
if you want to be cynical about it,

425
00:19:25,853 --> 00:19:27,252
that's a good way to put it.

426
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:29,321
But I like to say I'm
helping people find...

427
00:19:29,356 --> 00:19:30,646
Buy more shit.

428
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,826
Sorry. I'm sorry.
That's really impressive.

429
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:36,328
So you run a tech company?

430
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:38,430
<i>I did run a tech company.</i>

431
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:42,167
And about six months ago,
I got some offers to sell...

432
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:44,336
and here I am.

433
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,039
Yes, here you are.

434
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,511
You know,
I know this is out of the blue,

435
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:56,014
but, um,
Saturday I'm having a barbecue...

436
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,649
Some friends, some family coming by.

437
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:00,219
Why don't you join us,
have some lunch, a few drinks?

438
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:02,154
- No.
- Whoa.

439
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:04,489
Sorry. It came out wrong.
I-I would love to.

440
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:05,824
It's just, you know,

441
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,228
new job and, um,
a lot on my plate right now.

442
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:10,395
Okay, well, yeah, no.

443
00:20:10,431 --> 00:20:11,830
No pressure.

444
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:14,700
But just in case...

445
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,401
- here is my number.
- Hey.

446
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:18,670
Well, good morning, Ms. Keyes.

447
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:21,807
Patrick, this is,
Florence, the new IT guy.

448
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:23,675
The IT guy?

449
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:25,697
Got to watch those IT guys.

450
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:26,890
He knows where the bodies are buried.

451
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:28,647
- Ha!
- Anyway...

452
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,883
- Give me a call, just in case.
- Great.

453
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:33,385
- You guys have a great day.
- Yeah.

454
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:37,556
We're not even halfway there,

455
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:39,691
and at the rate we're going
through gas and snacks...

456
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,261
We need to eat every two hours
to maintain peak performance.

457
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:46,698
Whatever. Look, the point is $213.12...

458
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:48,500
Is definitely not gonna get us there.

459
00:20:48,535 --> 00:20:51,503
We need to figure out how to get more.

460
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:53,605
We need to get smart.

461
00:21:02,082 --> 00:21:04,283
So I can't buy protein shakes,
but you can buy books?

462
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:06,518
Short cons.

463
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:08,298
Let's make some money
the old-fashioned way.

464
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:10,088
Start reading.

465
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:14,526
<i>I'll give you a dime for every quarter</i>

466
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:15,727
<i>you can lay on end.</i>

467
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:17,229
<i>- Sir?
- How you doing?</i>

468
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:18,964
<i>Hi. Could I get a Miller, please?</i>

469
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:20,799
<i>You got it.</i>

470
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:28,068
<i>Ten in a row.</i>

471
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:32,244
<i>"Chapter one, The Fundamentals...</i>

472
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:34,112
"No short-con repertoire
would be complete

473
00:21:34,148 --> 00:21:35,748
"without the classic
distraction maneuver

474
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,382
"known as the 'bait and switch.'

475
00:21:37,418 --> 00:21:38,750
<i>"The key is picking</i>

476
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:40,652
<i>the appropriate unsuspecting target."</i>

477
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:42,754
So we're really gonna do this?

478
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,158
I mean, I want to find her, man.
I really do, but...

479
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:48,427
this guy and his family?

480
00:21:48,462 --> 00:21:52,331
- That'll make us just as bad as...
- Ava.

481
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:53,765
You know, one of those books

482
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:56,134
said you can't cheat an honest man.

483
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,136
Yeah, I read that. I still don't get it.

484
00:21:58,172 --> 00:21:59,638
- Hey, thank you.
- You're welcome.

485
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:00,939
It's like there are people

486
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:02,574
who set themselves up to be taken

487
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:03,976
because they're, you know,

488
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:07,346
greedy or selfish or mean.

489
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,781
You know what?
We need some ground rules.

490
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:12,377
We need, like, a code of conduct
for how far we're willing to go.

491
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:15,587
Like you said, we can't just
steal from normal people, right?

492
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,409
You know what else?

493
00:22:17,444 --> 00:22:20,412
Bushido, the samurai code...

494
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,415
the true warrior must hold that loyalty,
courage, and honor

495
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,583
are important above all else.

496
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,718
Nice.

497
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:30,054
- No old people.
- Sure.

498
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,122
Yeah.

499
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:34,025
No kids.

500
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,594
No people who look, you know, sad.

501
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,796
Yeah.

502
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:40,031
No nice moms or dads...

503
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:42,233
or anyone who's limping.

504
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,902
No babies.

505
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,205
What does that leave us?

506
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:49,073
Hey, lady...

507
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,942
next time get both hips replaced.

508
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:55,380
Assholes.

509
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,223
Excuse me there, bud.

510
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,259
You know,
I seem to have gotten a little bit lost.

511
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:10,261
Maybe you could help me out here.

512
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:12,464
Sure. I'm tourist information today...
where you going?

513
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:14,466
So we are heading, um,

514
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:17,846
to the east, and we need a...

515
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,531
I'm trying to get on the 29 here.

516
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,904
Yeah, that's where
your finger's pointing...

517
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:22,242
- Right there, the 29.
- That's right.

518
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:24,970
But I-I can't figure
out how to get to it.

519
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,806
See right out there where
it says turn left to the 29?

520
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:30,642
That's how you get to the 29.

521
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:34,419
Okay, that would make sense.

522
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,787
What?

523
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:37,288
What are you two zibs doing?

524
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,023
You should be more careful with this,
sir.

525
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,103
What the hell?
Are you trying to lift my card, asshole?

526
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:43,495
Hey, he's not an asshole.
You're the asshole.

527
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,130
My God, an American eagle.

528
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:51,135
Go, go, go!

529
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:52,871
He's coming!

530
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:54,873
- I know! I know!
- Go, go, go!

531
00:23:54,908 --> 00:23:57,308
- I'm going, I'm going!
- Go, go!

532
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:58,877
- Okay!
- Turn, turn, turn!

533
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:01,346
- I'm turning!
- God!

534
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:02,680
That did not go well!

535
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:04,382
I know! I was there!

536
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:10,613
His big hobby, his passion is darts.

537
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:14,246
- Yeah.
- No, he's in a darts league

538
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:18,017
that competes every Friday at
a pub called St. James's Well.

539
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:19,618
Am I the only one

540
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,720
who thinks there's something
off about this job?

541
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:23,255
The only thing off is Maddie's focus.

542
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,623
Give me a break, Max.

543
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,425
Maddie, I want to make
something very clear.

544
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:29,028
This job happens to be of
special interest to the Doctor.

545
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,430
Max is just freaking out
'cause I had coffee

546
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:33,232
and talked to some guy at a coffee shop.

547
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:35,468
No, it's the way
that you were talking to him

548
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:37,570
that concerns me.

549
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,438
You know what, Sal?

550
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:42,041
Why don't you tell her about Tulsa?

551
00:24:42,076 --> 00:24:43,609
- Max...
- No, tell her, Sal.

552
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:46,979
- She needs to know.
- What?

553
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:50,649
What happened in Tulsa?

554
00:24:52,854 --> 00:24:56,055
It was almost ten years ago, I guess.

555
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,257
We'd just started
working for the Doctor.

556
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:00,125
It was a...

557
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:02,828
a long game... a real-estate scam...

558
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:04,830
and about the hottest
summer you can imagine,

559
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:06,465
so I went to the movies a lot.

560
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:09,468
And this guy was...

561
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:12,104
sitting a few seats from me one night,

562
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,074
and he offered me some Junior Mints.

563
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:17,076
His name was Martin.

564
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:20,279
<i>And he was...</i>

565
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:23,649
<i>just about the sweetest guy I ever met.</i>

566
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:26,085
We just seem to fit.

567
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,421
<i>You know, sometimes
you get a taste of real life,</i>

568
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:31,857
and it seems pretty all right.

569
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:34,660
You start daydreaming, you know...

570
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:37,162
about getting out for good.

571
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,100
So what happened?

572
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:45,104
<i>Well, let's just say the
Doctor sent me a message...</i>

573
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:47,873
<i>a little reminder</i>

574
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:50,843
<i>that anybody not in the life,
not like us,</i>

575
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:53,012
<i>is a liability.</i>

576
00:25:57,351 --> 00:26:01,887
And if you care about those people,
you know...

577
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:05,190
you have to be careful.

578
00:26:08,838 --> 00:26:09,838
And sweet Max...

579
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,342
was there to put me back together,

580
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:13,866
weren't you, Maxie?

581
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:17,570
Anything for you, Sal. You know that.

582
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:25,477
All right, I get it.

583
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:29,348
But this guy at the coffee shop...

584
00:26:29,383 --> 00:26:30,549
he's a nobody.

585
00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:32,918
You don't have to worry.

586
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:35,020
Really, I'm on it.

587
00:27:12,393 --> 00:27:13,759
Want something?

588
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:16,595
Yeah. I'll have a Manhattan, please.

589
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:18,063
Keep the change.

590
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:19,565
I need a little favor.

591
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,967
You know what? Put it on our tab.

592
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:24,203
- Hi.
- No, thanks.

593
00:27:24,238 --> 00:27:26,205
Why not?

594
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,375
If I let you, it'll cost me more.

595
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,410
All right, all right, fair enough.

596
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:34,780
How about if I can get you
to say the word "seventeen"?

597
00:27:36,651 --> 00:27:38,417
I bet I can get you

598
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:40,419
to say "seventeen," and if I do,

599
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:41,920
you have to join us.

600
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,822
- You're on.
- All right.

601
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:45,290
- What's two plus two?
- Four.

602
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:46,792
- Four plus four?
- Eight.

603
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:48,293
- Eight plus eight?
- Sixteen.

604
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,173
See, I told you I could get you
to say "sixteen."

605
00:27:50,197 --> 00:27:53,599
- No, you said "sevente"...
- See? What?

606
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:55,434
You walked right into that one.

607
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:57,436
Okay, I'm impressed.

608
00:27:57,471 --> 00:28:00,105
All right, you can buy me a drink now.

609
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:02,074
- All right.
- What's going on here?

610
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:03,575
Mr. Heller.

611
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:07,012
Gary, you... know this one?

612
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,249
Ms. Keyes works for me.

613
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,816
Really? Give your HR person a bonus.

614
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:12,251
All right, all right.

615
00:28:14,855 --> 00:28:16,188
What are you doing here?

616
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:18,023
I live right around the corner.

617
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,792
Just getting to know the city.

618
00:28:19,827 --> 00:28:21,260
Is this a good spot?

619
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:23,028
Well, you have to go where the darts are

620
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:24,196
if you're in a darts league.

621
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:25,664
Big darts game tonight?

622
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,266
Match.

623
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:29,535
It's called a darts match.

624
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,805
Big darts match tonight?

625
00:28:35,342 --> 00:28:37,276
You know, the game of darts goes back

626
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:40,212
to the Battle of Agincourt
in the 15th century.

627
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:44,049
The first dartboard was actually
the cross section of a tree.

628
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:45,484
Wow.

629
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,686
You're a real enthusiast.

630
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:50,055
I kind of like history in general.

631
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:52,491
I like the perspective
on why things happen.

632
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:56,862
Never been my favorite subject.

633
00:28:56,897 --> 00:29:00,699
I do love old movies, like "Casablanca."

634
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:03,869
That's kind of history, right?

635
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,074
Ms. Keyes,
you are a breath of fresh air.

636
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,510
Call me Saffron. We're not at work.

637
00:29:11,545 --> 00:29:14,880
Gary, more vodka shooters
before I take your money.

638
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:16,215
Your turn, big guy.

639
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,218
No, no, no, no, no,
no, my turn, my turn.

640
00:29:19,253 --> 00:29:22,321
And, um, when I come back,

641
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:24,523
will you teach me how to shoot a dart?

642
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:26,225
Okay, but are you sure you don't want

643
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,427
the reigning champ to teach you?

644
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:31,530
Positive. I imagine
Gary knows what he's doing.

645
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:38,904
Vodka, vodka, water.

646
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:40,710
Drink them under the table.

647
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:52,184
Okay, okay, okay.

648
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:53,930
There's a lot of money on that table...
I'm nervous.

649
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,866
No, no, I got your covered.
Don't worry about it.

650
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,924
Don't believe him!
Gary's not exactly on a winning streak.

651
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,926
Ignore that. Just ignore that.
Focus just on this.

652
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:02,561
Breathe. Just breathe.

653
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:04,134
Do it!

654
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,970
Aah! My gosh! In your face!

655
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:13,272
That is bullshit!

656
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:15,407
No, no, no, that is such bullshit.

657
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:16,875
Let's go again, double or nothing.

658
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:18,477
Double or nothing, let's go again.

659
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:20,157
- Let's go again.
- Don't be a sore loser, Freddy.

660
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,080
I think I better quit while I'm ahead.

661
00:30:22,116 --> 00:30:24,583
Hey, Gary is a pussy, okay?
You don't have to be a pussy.

662
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:26,785
And he's, like, so cranky.
He's so cranky.

663
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,821
Ever since Patty left
him for the pool boy...

664
00:30:30,023 --> 00:30:31,168
Keep talking, Freddy. Keep talking.

665
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:32,958
- Jesus, calm down.
- Keep talking.

666
00:30:32,993 --> 00:30:35,160
- Apologize to the lady.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

667
00:30:35,196 --> 00:30:36,962
- Apologize to the lady.
- Relax, man!

668
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:39,398
Gary, Gary, can we please
just get out of here?

669
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:43,402
Please?

670
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,872
What the hell?

671
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:30,012
Sorry I lost my temper back there.

672
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,824
No, it's okay.
You were just defending my honor.

673
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,298
I don't feel so good.

674
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,038
Get you a glass of water.

675
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,047
I know people say you're a jerk, but...

676
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,853
they just don't know the real you.

677
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,865
I'm just gonna put this here.

678
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,500
You're gonna need that.

679
00:32:17,963 --> 00:32:20,870
And a truckload of aspirin.

680
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,911
Get some sleep.

681
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:49,098
<i>Hello?</i>

682
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,901
So this barbecue on Saturday...

683
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:54,504
<i>- Yes?
- I was just wondering</i>

684
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,540
if there was gonna be a
smoked brisket involved.

685
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,542
<i>Wait. So you'll come based on the meat?</i>

686
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:00,935
Yes.

687
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,112
Yes, that's the deciding factor.

688
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,114
<i>Done. So what's up for tonight?</i>

689
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,550
Not much.

690
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,353
Just a quiet evening at home.

691
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,055
You?

692
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,557
<i>Not a lot... just getting
my daily dose of jazz.</i>

693
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,125
<i>You hear it?</i>

694
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,361
Love that one.

695
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,797
Crank it up.

696
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,442
You've got something
right here on your...

697
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:33,776
- Me?
- What is that... ketchup?

698
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,144
What?

699
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,380
- Okay, not bad.
- You felt it?

700
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,447
A bit, a bit.

701
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,582
- Okay, my turn.
- All right.

702
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,610
Taxi!

703
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,786
- I'm so sorry.
- No worries.

704
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,588
Ooh, man, only
a slight breeze that time.

705
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,156
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's getting better.

706
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,791
All right. Ready for some driving?

707
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,927
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Let's go.

708
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,164
I could use a little
"Viva La Vida" right about now.

709
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,799
Okay, how about this?

710
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,979
From now on, whoever has the
wallet controls the radio.

711
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:02,605
Deal, baby. Let the game begin.

712
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,806
What the...

713
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,408
How'd you do that?

714
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,111
- Thank you.
- Son of a bitch.

715
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,208
<i>"At the bottom of every frozen heart,</i>

716
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,378
<i>there is a drop or two of love..."</i>

717
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,613
Till death do us part.

718
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,015
<i>"Just enough to feed a birds."</i>

719
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:56,692
This better work.

720
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,697
- It's sourdough, right?
- Yep. Here you go.

721
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,733
Thanks.

722
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,068
It's all old folks.

723
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,904
Not an asshole in sight.

724
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,239
Should we just go?

725
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,507
You know...

726
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,209
Hey, does "wheat"

727
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:15,811
sound anything like "sourdough"?

728
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,247
You know, put a nickel in it, honey.

729
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,250
Assholes trump old people.

730
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,585
Good amendment.

731
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,554
It's a living document.

732
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,489
Mustard dip. Ready?

733
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,692
<i>The mustard dip... a simple
yet effective small-time con.</i>

734
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,837
<i>- You know the secret to making toast?
- Pick a mark with a calm,</i>

735
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,023
<i>- easygoing temperament.
- You toast it!</i>

736
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,901
<i>Next, casually spill a
condiment of your choosing</i>

737
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,236
<i>on your unsuspecting mark.</i>

738
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,904
Here, let me give you a hand.

739
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,805
<i>Now, in one simple, fluid motion,</i>

740
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,642
<i>remove your mark's jacket.</i>

741
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,111
<i>This should be done without
effort or aggression.</i>

742
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,514
<i>Finally, extract the wallet
just as your partner appears</i>

743
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,983
<i>to seamlessly abscond with it.</i>

744
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:56,850
<i>Perfect in elegance and simplicity.</i>

745
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:00,533
This man stole my wallet!

746
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:01,767
<i>Well done.</i>

747
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:03,436
Whoa. No, he did not.

748
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:05,071
Here... It's here.

749
00:36:05,106 --> 00:36:07,106
I found it. It's on the floor.

750
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:08,941
You should be nicer.

751
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,977
Eat a D, Nancy.

752
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:14,747
Sorry about that.

753
00:36:14,782 --> 00:36:16,315
Dude, that was so embarrassing, man.

754
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:17,682
Dude, we suck.

755
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:18,989
Hey.

756
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:22,755
I took it right out
before I gave it back.

757
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:24,423
I knew we had it, man!

758
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:25,958
- Shh!
- Way to go, dude.

759
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:27,760
Ooh, gets you all...
adrenaline, endorphins.

760
00:36:27,795 --> 00:36:29,762
- I know.
- It's like a drug.

761
00:36:29,797 --> 00:36:31,264
I know.

762
00:36:31,299 --> 00:36:33,332
Hey, you think this is how she felt

763
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:36,135
when she took us?

764
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,771
I mean, what if we don't
even recognize her?

765
00:36:38,806 --> 00:36:40,184
She might not recognize us.

766
00:36:42,443 --> 00:36:44,577
We need to get cleaned up, man.

767
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:46,612
We're less than an hour away.

768
00:36:54,191 --> 00:36:55,791
Going out for a few hours, Viv.

769
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:58,994
- See you later.
- Okay, have good day.

770
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:28,076
- Good. You're still here.
- Hello, Mr. Heller.

771
00:38:28,112 --> 00:38:31,914
I almost done and, get out of here.

772
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:33,248
I go now.

773
00:38:33,284 --> 00:38:35,017
No, stay.

774
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:36,451
Please.

775
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:38,420
There's something I
want to ask you about.

776
00:38:38,455 --> 00:38:40,289
Sure, yeah.

777
00:38:40,324 --> 00:38:41,857
So this girl...

778
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:45,060
- Saffron.
- Such a pretty name.

779
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:46,461
And you like her?

780
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:50,065
So what problem?

781
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,868
I had a fiancée...

782
00:38:52,903 --> 00:38:56,438
not so long ago,
and it did not end well for me.

783
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:59,641
The heart is strong muscle.

784
00:38:59,677 --> 00:39:01,276
It spring back.

785
00:39:01,312 --> 00:39:04,313
You ready for the love again.

786
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:06,593
Yeah, but I don't know if this
is the kind of woman that...

787
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:09,651
Come, Mr. Heller, you handsome man.

788
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:12,387
Don't.

789
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:14,289
I know how people see me.

790
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:20,662
But this Saffron make you feel good.

791
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:23,665
Yeah.

792
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:26,301
She makes me want to...

793
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:27,970
be nice.

794
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:33,609
I think you have good
luck with this girl.

795
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:36,311
<i>If there's any way we could see the room</i>

796
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:38,614
before paying for it...

797
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:42,284
um, we just want to make sure
the room is up to our standards.

798
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,152
We don't usually let
people see the rooms

799
00:39:44,188 --> 00:39:45,787
before they check in.

800
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:49,458
I guess they just
don't want us here, babe.

801
00:39:53,964 --> 00:39:56,131
You want to carry me
over the threshold, too?

802
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,634
Yeah, you wish. Let's hurry this up.

803
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:04,573
Are you coming out anytime this year?

804
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:10,879
Crap, I think we're out of hot water.

805
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:14,516
Hey, man, you want to use this?

806
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:15,617
Eat shit!

807
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:22,190
Hello, Alice.

808
00:40:22,226 --> 00:40:24,359
Hello, Ava.

809
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:27,362
We decided against it.

810
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:28,964
Um, not enough...

811
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:30,198
natural light.

812
00:40:30,234 --> 00:40:32,134
Thank you.

813
00:40:43,414 --> 00:40:44,880
This is it.

814
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,462
What's up?

815
00:41:05,436 --> 00:41:08,203
- She's in there.
- Yeah.

816
00:41:08,238 --> 00:41:10,008
Okay, whatever happens...

817
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,774
- Good luck.
- Yeah, man, you too.

818
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,411
All right, mother-frickin' Avon calling.

819
00:41:21,618 --> 00:41:24,186
<i>Let's meet Julia and her husband, John.</i>

820
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:33,195
<i>John, you love your wife a lot, right?</i>

821
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,262
Just a minute.

822
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:35,864
<i>All right.</i>

823
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:45,947
Yeah?

824
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,383
That'll be $16.75.

825
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,751
- Here you go.
- Great.

826
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:51,453
Who the hell are you?

827
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:53,421
Who the hell are you?

828
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:55,624
Do you know this woman?

829
00:41:58,795 --> 00:42:02,130
Are you kidding me? She's my wife.

830
00:42:02,165 --> 00:42:04,232
No way.

831
00:42:05,979 --> 00:42:06,902
Is she dead?

832
00:42:06,937 --> 00:42:08,904
- What?
- No.

833
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:10,739
- No, wait.
- Hold on, hold on.

834
00:42:10,774 --> 00:42:12,474
We want to ask you
some questions, please.

835
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:14,376
Open this door...
