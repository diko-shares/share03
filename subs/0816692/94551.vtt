1
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,671
That must have cost him a bomb.

2
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,070
Couple of hundred Gs?
But what's money to Boy Buckley?

3
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,549
- Pop this, Peter.
- Starting without our host?

4
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,279
Boy won't mind.
Anyway, he did say seven, Rupert.

5
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,954
Oh, here comes Stephen Crane.

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,349
(Rupert) Closely followed by
the O'Dells, I see.

7
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,352
- I'd better get some more glasses.
- Who else is coming?

8
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,592
Evening, my dears. You do realise
we're taking our lives in our hands?

9
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,831
- Who's gonna steer this thing?
- (Rupert) Boy, I suppose, it's his boat.

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,311
Then we'll not get out of the harbour -
the entrance is only a hundred yards wide.

11
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,598
- Champers, lovely. Thank you, Emerald.
- (Tommy ) Hi, fans.

12
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,672
- (Sally) You look wonderful, darling.
- Is this the good trip Lollipop?

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,719
- The master mariner isn't here yet.
- We just saw him parking the limo.

14
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,429
- Are we going far?
- Just outside the harbour, Boy said.

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,795
- (Emerald) Away from prying eyes.
- Cheers.

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,440
I have a feeling
this is going to be quite a night.

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,592
Well, I have a feeling
it's going to be an absolute disaster.

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,116
- (Stephen ) Oh, my God. Will you look at that?
- Everyone here?

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,714
Looks like something out of HMS Pinafore

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,439
as performed by
the Balham Boys' Choir.

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,476
Sorry we're late.

22
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,714
Boy, that uniform
is really something else.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,758
- You like it!
- Darling, you look utterly edible.

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,831
Come here. (Laughs )

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,751
It's great to see you all.

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,671
Er, Peter, cast off for'ard, will you?

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,398
Tom, aft.

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,995
Come on!
Let's get this show on the road.

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,310
I'm going to sit right here in the middle
where I can't see the water.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,072
Em?

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,835
Come up here, kitten.
I'll show you which knobs to pull.

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,308
- I think Emerald has been chosen.
- Oh.

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,275
Jealous already, Rupert, darling?

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,237
(Engine starts )

35
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,118
(Jim ) Rupert Galliers, aged 40.

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,794
Missing, presumed drowned.

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,189
His wife, we think,
went overboard with him.

38
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,511
- They are trying to pump her out now.
- And nobody saw what happened?

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,910
No, according to the statements
they were all down below.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,709
I'm off down to the hospital to see if
Emerald Galliers can tell us anything.

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,109
Weekend sailors! How often do we get this?

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,634
Yeah, but not too many
in that tax bracket, eh?

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,475
(Doctor) We are doing
everything possible, Sergeant.

44
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,437
(Jim ) What's her chances?

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,911
Not good. But she's young and healthy,
she might pull through.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,434
The rescue team said her heart stopped twice
on the way in.

47
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,478
(Doctor) The main problem is
she's showing no signs of brain life.

48
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,199
If the brain stem is dead,
there's nothing anyone can do.

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,993
Nothing?

50
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,039
In these cases we just hang on
for a few days and hope.

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,714
As you can see,
her heart function is fine now.

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,598
If there's any change -
you know, any change at all -

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,636
give us a ring.

54
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,469
(Drums pounding)

55
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,398
Somebody to...

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,072
- You cow! I'll kill you!
- (Screaming)

57
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,069
Please, don't!

58
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,476
- Police?
- Sergeant Bergerac.

59
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,632
That's what I came
to tell you... darling!

60
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,995
- Stupid bitch!
- Hey, hey, hey.

61
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,036
Look what she done.

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,349
- Why?
- Just getting his attention.

63
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,998
He's deaf, you see.

64
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,435
Too much bonga-bonga
when he was young.

65
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,909
I want you out of here today, bitch!

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,037
- I'd like Miss... It is Miss, yeah?
- Gudrun Olfsberg.

67
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,793
I'd like her to stay until
the investigation is finished.

68
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,677
(Boy ) Investigation?

69
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,593
It was an accident, man.

70
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,989
What the hell do you want, Bergerac?

71
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,230
I want you to come and see a body.

72
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,517
- You're putting me on.
- The coastguards picked it up this morning.

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,388
- We want a positive identification.
- For God's sake, why me?

74
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,358
Well, he was your friend,
he fell off your boat,

75
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,396
least you can do, isn't it?

76
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,948
Look, man, I can't stand all that stuff.

77
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,679
Well, if it bothers you,
I'll hold your hand.

78
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,113
(Laughs )

79
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,270
Shut your stupid face!

80
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,232
You all right?

81
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,509
God! He looked awful.

82
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,717
Yeah, well, they...
swell up in the water. Come on.

83
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,239
Don't ever ask me again, Bergerac.
I mean, if they find Em, right?

84
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,551
Emerald Galliers?
Well, she's in hospital.

85
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,278
- Em is?
- Yeah.

86
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,592
Did no one tell you?
She was found almost at once.

87
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,830
- You mean Em's alive.
- Yeah.

88
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,754
Oh, wow, that's really wild, man!
I mean, I'll go and see her.

89
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,196
She's in intensive care.
You'll have to wait for a while.

90
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,396
Oh, sure, yeah.

91
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,833
Er...

92
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,516
Look, man, I'm gonna split, OK?
I can't take these places.

93
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,592
Thanks for coming.

94
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,077
(Jim ) Nice little toy that, isn't it?

95
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,391
(Barney ) He only got it last week.
It was a yacht-warming party.

96
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,436
What, a hundred yards offshore?

97
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,479
His kind don't buy them to sail,
they buy them to be looked at.

98
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,518
(Jim ) What do we know
about this guy, Buckley?

99
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,397
Everything that everybody else knows.

100
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,790
- He made X millions from that pop group.
- He got busted a lot, didn't he?

101
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,269
Just the standard things,
drunk driving, assault...

102
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,591
- All yours, sir..
- Thank you. Drugs, underage girls.

103
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,353
What he pays in paternity orders
would run our department.

104
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,273
- Mere youthful peccadilloes.
- Yes, that's right.

105
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,113
If he's got that kind of record,
why did they let him in here?

106
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,714
How do you keep well-heeled
British citizens out?

107
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,597
People like Charlie Hungerford?

108
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,194
At least Charlie has the virtue of being discreet.

109
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,478
And he didn't bring the Yorkshire mafia with
him, Buckley has a whole gang of hangers-on.

110
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,357
Was Rupert Galliers one of them?

111
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,398
I don't know but he belonged to that group.
The Six Gin Valley lot.

112
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,517
- And that before breakfast, eh?
- (Laughing) Yes.

113
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,430
It's a low rail, Jim,
not difficult to get over there.

114
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,671
Yeah, in a force nine perhaps.
There was flat calm last night.

115
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,116
Remember it was dark
and they must've been all boozed up.

116
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,113
It wasn't dark, it was a clear night,
full moon. Yet nobody saw anything.

117
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,475
And most of them say
they didn't hear anything either.

118
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,913
They were all below.

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,116
Galliers and his wife
were alone up here.

120
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,873
- According to the statements.
- Yes, exactly.

121
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,679
And they all cross-check.
There's no mystery.

122
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,832
- Somebody may be lying.
- Why?

123
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,549
Perhaps because it wasn't an accident.
Got to check it.

124
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,596
You'd check on your own mother.

125
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,433
She looks lovely, doesn't she?
Just like she's sleeping.

126
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,036
You say that's got nowt to do
with the bang on the head?

127
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,238
No, that's just
a minor contusion, Mr Osman.

128
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,959
Well, how long is she
going to be like this?

129
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,715
- It's impossible to say.
- She's in a coma, Dad.

130
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,189
- She's going to get better, though?
- I hope so.

131
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,238
We're just keeping
our fingers crossed.

132
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,311
Ah, this is Sergeant Bergerac

133
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,119
of the Bureau Des Etrangers.
Mr and Mrs Osman.

134
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,919
Oh, Mrs Galliers' parents.
You got here quick.

135
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,673
(Jim ) You got somewhere to stay?

136
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,230
Well, no, not yet.
We came direct from the airport.

137
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,632
We can stay here, can't we?
So we can be with her.

138
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,508
We could try to make arrangements,
it's a bit late now.

139
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,034
Really there's nothing
you can do at the moment.

140
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,078
Why don't you let me take you over
to your daughter's house?

141
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,628
I don't know.
What do you think, Dad?

142
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,439
- Do you think we should?
- Well, it might be best, love.

143
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,476
- (Jim ) All right?
- Right.

144
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,711
If you get your things,
I'll meet you downstairs in two minutes.

145
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,713
You know, Dad, I think
she's looking better already. Don't you?

146
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,917
She'll be right
as ninepence tomorrow.

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,956
Aye, of course she will.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,877
(Mrs Osman ) Thank you.

149
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,876
Obviously you want something.

150
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,191
Yeah, I'd like to look at
that bruise on her forehead.

151
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,318
(Doctor) Small cut, small swelling.

152
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,392
- Consistent with a blow?
- I'm not an expert.

153
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,916
- You must have seen a lot of those.
- What sort of blow?

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,833
- From a fist, with a heavy ring.
- (Doctor) Perhaps.

155
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,356
She could also have
hit her head on a stanchion as she fell.

156
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,876
- Would she have been stunned?
- Probably, it's on the temporal lobe.

157
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,748
- How long would she have been unconscious?
- Impossible to say.

158
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,796
One minute, two minutes?

159
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,668
If I had to guess,
I'd say the shock of hitting the water

160
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,830
would have revived her
within a few seconds.

161
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,230
These are questions one can't answer
with any certainty.

162
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,357
I'm running into a lot of those meself.
Thank you.

163
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,556
Oh, it is a lovely place, isn't it?

164
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,518
Ee, our Jenny is so proud of it.

165
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,989
She's always writing about the things
she's doing, you know Jenny.

166
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,914
- Improvements she's making.
- Jenny was her name?

167
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,039
She called herself Emerald when she turned
professional. Sort of stage name, like.

168
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,396
- I didn't know she'd been an actress.
- Nay, she wasn't an actress.

169
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,758
Our Jenny were British junior
ice-dancing champion.

170
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,389
Well, I've got the keys to the house,
we might as well go in.

171
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,313
New carpet!
She never mentioned that.

172
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,033
- Know what I could do with, lass?
- Nice cup of tea.

173
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,315
Oh, we'll get our things
round to our room first.

174
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,868
- No, let me.
- No, no, no, they're only light.

175
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,757
Didn't pack much.

176
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,477
Ah, there you are.
Well, got me orders. Put t'kettle on.

177
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,716
You've been here before, Mr Osman?

178
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,553
Aye, last Christmas
just for a few days.

179
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,269
Our Jen wanted us to stay longer,
but... I don't know, I thought...

180
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,078
What?

181
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,073
(Mr Osman ) Well, all this,
the friends she made...

182
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,116
not our sort.

183
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,760
We're ordinary people, Betty and me.

184
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,278
What Marx calls
the oppressed proletariat.

185
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,193
Not so ordinary.
Not with a daughter as a champion.

186
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,475
Aye.

187
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,519
It's something she always wanted
from the time she were a little lass.

188
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,592
Course, took a lot of time and money.
We went everywhere with her.

189
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,636
When you'd rather have been watching United?

190
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,359
Oh, it were worth it... I suppose.

191
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,712
- What do you do for a living?
- Barkeeper.

192
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,997
Been at it 20 year.
You fancy a cup of tea?

193
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,868
No, thanks, a bit pushed for time.
Your son-in-law, what did he do?

194
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,316
Owned a stud farm, so he said.
Sold it when he retired.

195
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,358
How the hell anyone could
retire at his age beats me.

196
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,273
Did you like him?

197
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,638
That's a funny question, Sergeant,
the lad just died.

198
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,950
Oh, yeah, of course. Sorry.

199
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,589
I... He...

200
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,196
He weren't the sort of lad that I thought our
Jenny should have wed, if that's what you mean.

201
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,350
That's what I meant.

202
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,396
Ah, there's your keys.

203
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,636
I'll be in touch.

204
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,638
I saw the door open.

205
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,837
I was gonna call the cops
but then I saw your motor.

206
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,639
Mrs Galliers' parents are here.

207
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,029
- How is Em?
- Holding up.

208
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,758
I called the hospital.

209
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,196
- They said she was critical.
- Did they?

210
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,479
- Anything I can do?
- Yes, you can get out of my car.

211
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,958
A car like this, man,
makes you an exhibitionist.

212
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,508
And what does your
white Lagonda make you?

213
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,832
I'm in show business.
I want a police guard, Bergerac.

214
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,673
- A guard? Why?
- My bell's not stopped today.

215
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,149
I'm ex-directory but them hounds
found the number.

216
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,753
They'll be all over
the island tomorrow.

217
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,308
- What are you talking about?
- The press, man!

218
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,233
They'll be sniffing through my trash bins,
looking in keyholes.

219
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,038
I want a guard.

220
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,237
I'm sure you're very used
to handling the press, Mr Buckley.

221
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,390
But if you feel you want
an officer assigned to you,

222
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,948
I suggest you talk to the chief of police.

223
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,996
Don't like me, do you?

224
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,759
I like everybody,
until they're proved guilty.

225
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,796
What?

226
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,872
I said I like everybody,
until they're proved guilty.

227
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,076
I saw you clocking me
down the morgue today.

228
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,550
- Got a real buzz out of that, didn't you?
- Good night.

229
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,870
- No, wait!
- What for?

230
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,158
I want to explain about myself,
about when I was a kid.

231
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,593
Well?.

232
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,672
Ma scarpered when I was nipper,
and I never had no father,

233
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,557
so I lived with me grandad.

234
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,030
He was a porter down Billingsgate
and he stank of fish.

235
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,076
The whole house ponged of it.

236
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,278
Then one day, he didn't go to work,
he stayed in bed

237
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,839
and he died.

238
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,514
I don't remember if he had a doctor,
he just died.

239
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,512
Right, I got that bit.

240
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,797
A neighbour came from down the street
to lay the old man out.

241
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,836
That's how she made her beer money.

242
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,593
After she'd done it,
she took me in to see him.

243
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,435
He had his blue suit on,
a bandage round his chin, pennies in his eyes.

244
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,751
I could only tell it was him
because he still smelt of fish.

245
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,239
You'd be good on Jackanory.

246
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,951
After a while, the smell went away,
just sort of bit by bit.

247
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,510
After a year, you couldn't smell it.

248
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,636
Nothing left.

249
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,870
It was like the old man had never lived.

250
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,315
- Know what I mean?
- Is that it?

251
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,279
Down there today brought it all back.
That's why I cracked up.

252
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,396
(Jim ) I see.

253
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,711
Well, I said it before
and I'll say it again - good night.

254
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,551
- Morning, Charlie.
- Hey! Oh!

255
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,756
There goes one
for the regimental lead fund.

256
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,637
- The what?
- An old army expression.

257
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,235
When were on the rifle range
we used to dig the bullets out

258
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,276
from behind the target, out of the sand.

259
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,796
You can make a useful few ackers
by the end of the week.

260
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,430
(Jim ) Was there ever a time in your life
when you didn't have a fiddle?

261
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,432
I think it all started when I was
milking the school milk fund.

262
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,432
A drop of water and you can soon
make three bottles stretch to five.

263
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,592
It's all going down in the great book,
you'll never get past St Peter.

264
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,353
Anyway, why are you harassing
a private citizen

265
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,115
peaceably practising toxophily
in his own garden?

266
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,633
Rupert Galliers.

267
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,314
- What do you know about him?
- I hear he drowned himself.

268
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,994
- That's the story being put about, is it?
- Well, didn't he?

269
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,718
Well, they usually leave a note.

270
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,633
Not if they want it
to look like an accident.

271
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,314
Then the wife can pick up the insurance.

272
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,710
Did he have any reason you know of
to top himself?

273
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,950
- Several, I should think.
- Give us a few.

274
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,600
Well, he was into the bank
for thousands, so I hear.

275
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,557
You see, he said he owned a stud farm,

276
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,473
but from some papers I saw made me think
he'd been something in the City.

277
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,074
He was with a firm
of stockbrokers, Axell Brown.

278
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,799
- Thought you'd know.
- And if Galliers ever owned a stud farm

279
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,871
you can bet it was
their money he bought it with.

280
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,473
- Like that, eh?
- Mm.

281
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,279
Cost Axell Brown three million,
they went out of business.

282
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,432
- Didn't he get hammered?
- No, they covered the loss

283
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,476
and scandals are bad for the market.

284
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,028
But there's one or two would have
hammered his kneecaps

285
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,350
- given half a chance.
- Thanks, Charlie.

286
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,796
If ever Nigel Dempster retires,
I'll tell them about you.

287
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,196
(Phone ringing)

288
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,518
- Good morning, James.
- No, it isn't.

289
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,158
(Charlotte ) Sorry.

290
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,433
Oh!

291
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,357
Very efficient!

292
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,431
- What's that?
- Path report on Galliers.

293
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,954
I've got some notes about him too
but I haven't typed them up yet.

294
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,793
- Yeah? What you got?
- Emerald Galliers, née Osman,

295
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,075
- skating champion. I think you know all that.
- Yeah.

296
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,197
Married 18 months ago,
she was 21, he was 38.

297
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,829
Divorced his first wife
three years before that, no children.

298
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,993
He was a top racing man and went to all
the meetings on both sides of the Channel.

299
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,389
Used to own a stud in Hampshire.

300
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,119
Man of independent means.
Aristocratic connections apparently.

301
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,553
(Laughs )

302
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,198
(Charlotte ) What are you chortling at?

303
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,113
Aristocratic connections!
It's horsefeathers, 90% of that.

304
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,873
- Ooh, well, thanks.
- Type it out anyway.

305
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,916
You're so nice to work for.

306
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,236
Oh, by the way, Lil called.
She said if you're thinking of dropping in,

307
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,959
the Royal Barge has reporters
like a pomegranate has pips.

308
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,871
- That's out, then, is it?
- Mm.

309
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,032
Oh, Charlotte - don't forget Stephen Crane.

310
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,314
No, sir.

311
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,153
- Have you seen this?
- Yes.

312
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,719
Tss...

313
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,039
(Knocks )

314
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,872
What's all this?
About it being a tragic accident?

315
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,475
The official line, Jim,
from the Chief and upwards,

316
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,835
is that they want this
put on the back burner.

317
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,275
- Why?
- Well you've read the papers.

318
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,035
- They're digging for scandal.
- Well, that's not our problem, is it?

319
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,556
This is a sunshine island
flowing with milk and early tomatoes.

320
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,030
We don't want the News of the Word to make it
sound like Sodom and Gomorrah.

321
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,111
Suppose Galliers was murdered.

322
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,715
We have statements from six people.
They all agree about what happened.

323
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,951
I mean, they're not Murder Incorporated.

324
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,632
Read this.

325
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,676
Found it in Galliers' desk.

326
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,635
"My dear Rupert,

there is some good stuff available"

329
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,795

It's cocaine, Barney.

333
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,071
The autopsy report said that Galliers was
blind drunk and doped up to the eyeballs.

334
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,550
Yes, well, the pathologist said
he couldn't have swam ten yards.

335
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,073
It was a drugs party.

336
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,835
So, they're a bunch of hopheads.
That doesn't make them murderers.

337
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,196
It just makes them more likely
to fall yachts.

338
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,238
You're going to have to do
better than that, Jim.

Yes, Sergeant Bergerac, Mr Campion.

350
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,034
I'd like to check over
the statements you made yesterday.

351
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,874
Well, really nothing to add.
We've talked about it of course.

352

Neither of us can understand
how it happened.

something might turn up.

354
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,997

- (Peter) Of course.

355
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,308
Thank you.

356
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,119
Would you like a coffee, Sergeant,
or a drink or something?

357
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,112
No, thank you, Mrs Campion.
Er, Sally Campion, yeah?

358
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,112
Yes. Sarah really.

359
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,794
Now, all your stories
tally on the point

360
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,836
that you were on deck till about 1:00am

361
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,878
and then you all went down into
the saloon for refreshments, right?

362
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,359
Yeah.

363
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,274
So, all eight of you were down
in the saloon, that's the Galliers,

364
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,830
yourselves, the O'Dells,
Mr Buckley and Mr Crane?

365
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,356
No, Stephen and Boy
had zonked out by then.

366
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,158
(Jim ) Oh, yes.

367
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,153
Mr Crane was resting in the main cabin,
after the saloon,

368
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,755
and Mr Buckley was in
the for'ard guest cabin.

369
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,549
And, sometime later, according to the statement,
he thought he heard a cry,

370
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,155
and when he checked the yacht out,
Mr and Mrs Galliers were missing.

371
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,869
Yeah, he came in looking panicky
and said he couldn't find them.

372
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,430
So he and I took the dinghy out
and rowed around for about 20 minutes

373
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,593
yelling and calling
and then we decided to get help.

374
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,593
Did either of you notice when
Mr and Mrs Galliers left the saloon?

375
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,636
We turned the lights down, actually,

376
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,836
and somebody put the music on again.

377
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,116
And around 2:00am, Mrs Campion,

378
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,111
you say you heard a woman cry?

379
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,318
I said I thought I heard something, yes.
I wasn't actually sure.

380
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,039
I didn't take it seriously of course.

381
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,351
I mean, I just thought, "Ooh, lucky thing."

382
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,189
I see. Is this your writing, Mrs Campion?

383
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,871

Yeah, perhaps.

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,189
Well, that's about it,
sorry to have disturbed you.

387
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,554
- Anytime.
- Thank you.

388

- Bye.
- Goodbye.

389
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,671
- Did you have to say that?
- Obvious conclusion, wasn't it?

390
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,479
If I hadn't drawn it
he'd have wondered why.

391
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,279
- Should we call Stephen?
- Best not.

392
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,830
I don't think we should have any contact
with Stephen till this blows over.

393
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,995
- Mr Buckley.
- Hi.

394
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,868
I'm Betty Osman, Jenny's mother.
We met at Christmas.

395

Oh, yeah I remember, yeah.
How is she?

396
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,313
She has a lot more colour today
and I saw her eyelids flicker just now.

397
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,197
That's a good sign, eh?

398
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,953

to open her eyes.

- Better get two.

405
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,876

- Do I?

408
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,671
She loved flowers too.

409
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,753
The whole house was full of flowers
when I was little, every room.

410
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,637
- How lovely.
- Oh, yeah.

411
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,676
I grew up surrounded by flowers.

412
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,788
The sweet peas, chrysanths,
roses, carnations.

413
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,950
Mum just loved the scent of them.

414
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,596
But after she died,
nobody bothered, you know.

415
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,710
And, sort of bit by bit,
the smell of them flowers just faded away.

416
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,472
After about a year

417
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,358
you couldn't smell them at all.

418
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,353
I think it was then I realised
that mum had gone forever.

419
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,116
- She's waiting in heaven, you know.
- Yeah. You a catholic?

420
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,953
- Yes.
- Me too.

421
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,592
Are you? Jenny never said it.
She's always writing about you, you know.

422

to be living near you.

Yeah, it was funny
the way I got converted.

425
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,878
We was all in this big hotel
in Honolulu one night

426
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,350
and it caught fire
two floors up from us.

427
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,829
There was smoke everywhere,
people screaming,

428
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,876
it was like going into the mouth of hell.

429
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,953
And then I saw this little old priest
on his knees in the passage.

430
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,712
I picked him up,

431
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,519
he was like a feather,
he must have been about 80.

432
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,953
And he said,

433
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,157
"Leave me, my son, help the others."

434
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,196
Course, I didn't, I carried him out.

435
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,675
Now I've met you,
you're not at all like what the papers say.

Oh, they tell such lies, Mrs Osman.
They persecute me.

say a prayer together?

- No, Bett's up with Jenny.

442
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,151
We was down here at seven this morning.

443
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,472

in Corporation Park today.

Oh, he's been in a few times.
He was in today in fact.

492
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,310
- He was in today?
- Buying drinks for reporters.

493
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,550
Yesterday, he wanted
a guard to keep them off.

494
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,792
Well, I got the impression today
he's rather enjoying being back in the limelight.

495
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,111
- Have you ever seen him with Crane?
- No, he usually has a girl in tow.

496
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,078
- I think it's part of the image.
- All macho in suede pants, is it?

497
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,469
- You don't like him.
- Don't like any of them, frankly.

498
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,472
That yacht should have sunk
with all hands.

499
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,516
He was a wonderful drummer
all the same.

500
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,431
Well, thanks for your help, Lil.

501
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,954
Jim, have you noticed
that man in the blue car?

502
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,554
- He's been hanging around all day.
- There ought to be law against it.

503
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,200
- Couldn't you think of one?
- I'll go through the book.

504
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,236
- Hey, do you want a lift?
- Oh, thanks.

505
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,111
Norbert, dear,
don't always be so physical.

506
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,760
Don't you see what it says?
With care, fragile.

507
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,070
Don't attack the thing with a hammer.

508
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,072
Go and get a screwdriver
and prise the lid off gently.

509
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,832
OK.

510
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,312
Are we just browsing,
or can I be of any assistance?

511
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,038
- You Mr Crane?
- Yes?

512
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,956
- Sergeant Bergerac.
- Oh, about that nasty accident, I suppose.

513
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,717
No, I didn't exactly take you
for an art lover, you look much too...

514
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,315
I understand that you and Mr Galliers
have been quite close friends.

515
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,073
Isn't that a little
ambiguous these days?

516
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,799
Well, you have been seen together
quite a lot.

517
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,270
Yes, well, that was before
Rupert married.

518
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,194
We were new here together, you see,
so we sort of chummed up.

519
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,191
How long have you known Boy Buckley?

520
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,193
Mmm, about three years.
I've sold him several pieces.

521
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,478
More objets than d'art, I'm afraid,
at outrageous prices.

522
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,120
- Did you know everyone at that party?
- Of course.

523
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,954
They are among my most valued clients,
rich and ignorant.

524
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,315
You see, they all live within
100 yards of each other

525
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,960
- whereas you...
- Live over the shop. Quite.

526
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,193
- Is that Norbert?
- Yes.

527
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,999
Is there somewhere we can talk
without all that?

528
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,435
- Yes, in here.
- Thank you.

529
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,068
You see, that seems
to make you the odd man out.

530
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,515
Yes, I suppose Boy invited me

531
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,955
because of my magnetism and charm.

532
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,191
- As a matter of fact, I very nearly didn't go.
- Why not?

533
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,236
Well, I assumed I was taking Norbert,

534
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,756
and so I phoned Boy to find out what to wear
and he says I wasn't to bring Norbert.

535
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,274
"Why not?" I say.
"Because he's coloured, " he says.

536
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,593
(Laughs ) My God. I very nearly
told him to stuff his rotten party.

537
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,389
- But you didn't.
- No. I decided to pay him back

538
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,870
by scoffing as much of
his beastly champagne as I could.

539
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,988
I mean, quel racist!
Besides Norbert isn't coloured.

540
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,278
Simply a richer,
rather lovelier shade of ivory.

541
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,433
Especially those part of him
on which the sun rarely shines.

542
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,074
In your statement,
you say that about midnight

543
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,754
you went into the main aft cabin
for a rest, right?

544
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,719
Yes, I'm afraid
I got monumentally wazzocked.

545
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,510
About an hour after that you say you thought
you heard a woman cry from the deck?

546
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,555
Er, yes.

547
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,076
- Did you do anything about that?
- No.

548
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,230
And you heard nothing
after that single cry?

549
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,197
No.

550
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,795
This, er... this your writing?

551
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,313
It would appear to be.

552
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,792
Would you mind telling me
what that refers to?

553
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,668
Er, well, Norbert's
my heavenly messenger.

554
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,036
I believe I'd sent Rupert
some snaps to look at.

555
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,669
He was interested
in some antique tapestries.

556
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,069
- (Jim ) Tapestries?
- Yes, in Lyons.

557
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,957
In Lyons?

558
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,873
Why would he be interested
in buying tapestries

559
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,111
when the bank was threatening
to foreclose on his house?

560
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,111
Were they now?

561
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,714
I always thought Rupert
was immensely rich.

562
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,870
Not by the time
of his death, he wasn't.

563
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,076
Well, he always was an intrepid gambler.

564
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,392
He paid his turf account
and his household bills by cheque.

565
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,598
But over the last three years
he's made some large withdrawals in cash.

566
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,470
- Quite the little weasel, aren't we?
- He needed it to buy cocaine.

567
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,597
Really? Well, now you come to mention it,

568
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,638
his pupils always did look
abnormally small.

569
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,676
Was Emerald Galliers on it?

570
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,558
I never looked
very deeply into her eyes.

571
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,076
- Boy Buckley?
- One has heard rumours.

572
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,674
The O'Dells and the Campions?

573
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,955
It was a drugs party
on that yacht, wasn't it?

574
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,350
I do find this minatory
attitude of yours very upsetting.

575
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,115
If you keep on, I shall either faint
or send for my lawyer.

576
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,912
You're probably
going to need him, Mr Crane.

577
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,673
Out.

578
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,598
Now, just what might
your little game be, sir?

579
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,951
Sam Silvers.
You work for that paper, do you?

580
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,519
SS.

581
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,672
My parents must have been the only Jews
with no sense of humour.

582
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,671
I write the showbiz page.

583
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,877
Well, I'm not in show business.
Why follow me?

584
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,396
I like a man who gets around,
I can charge more expenses.

585
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,755
Just routine inquiries, Mr Silvers.

586
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,991
Sergeant, I'm the world's greatest
expert on the back of your head.

587
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,631
If you had bigger ears, you'd look exactly like
a bloodhound on a strong scent.

588
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,188
You'll learn nothing following me.

589
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,032
How well do you know Boy Buckley?

590
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,951
Since he had chocolate round his mouth.

591
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,712
- You've been to see him?
- Not yet.

592
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,756
Time's on the side
of the Sunday newspaper.

593
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,559
Right, Mr Silvers, I'll tell you what I'll do.

594
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,234
I'll meet you tonight in
The Royal Barge. Know the place?

595
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,039
And you can tell me
all you know about Boy Buckley.

596
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,076
And in the meantime,
stay off my back,

597
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,116
otherwise I will run you in.

598
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,796
Tommy, this is Sergeant Bergerac
from the Bureau Des Etrangers.

599
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,872
Ah. Afternoon, Sergeant.
Can I offer you a drink?

600
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,598
Oh, no, course not.

601
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,069
You people don't
when you're on duty, do you?

602
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,915
Well, do sit down.
What can we do for you?

603
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,958
- You want one of these, darling?
- (Linda ) Yes, please.

604
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,198
Well, I'd like to ask you a few questions
about what happened the other night.

605
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,633
Shoot.

606
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,712
Did Mr Galliers seem in any way
different from normal?.

607
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,236
- No.
- He was being pretty foul to Emerald.

608
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,357
That's was normal.
He was always foul to Emerald.

609
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,396
What do you mean?
They didn't get on?

610
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,072
Understatement of the year.

611
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,151
Rupert was obsessively jealous of her.

612
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,629
Though he of course
could do what he liked.

613
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,075
The old double standard thing.

614
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,709
But that apart did he seem worried
or depressed about anything?

615
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,711
I wouldn't have said so.

616
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,349
Mind you, I didn't see much of him
after he went off with Gudrun.

617
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,716
Gudrun Olfsberg?
I didn't know she was there.

618
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,075
Well, she wasn't after about ten o'clock.

619
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,072
She threw a tremendous wobbly
and demanded to be put ashore.

620
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,957
(Linda ) She was drunk, that's all.

621
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,669
- So what happened?
- Oh, she and Boy had a big spat.

622
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,876
And finally Rupert offered to
row her ashore in the dinghy.

623
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,995
I see.

624
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,231
So Mr Galliers took her ashore
and then rowed back to the yacht, yeah?

625
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,515
- Eventually.
- What time did he get back?

626
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,637
Well, I didn't see him again
till almost midnight.

627
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,359
I think I remember
making some remark about it.

628
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,635
A very crude remark.

629
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,473
Well, we all know
what Gudrun's like, darling.

630
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,120
If she were a carpet
she'd be labelled "heavy duty".

631
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,956
Yeah, that's it, good one. And again.

632
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,315
Again. Yes.

633
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,358
OK, fellas. On the bridge.

634
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,714
- So you're friends again, are you?
- Strictly for the press.

635
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,758
Why did you leave the party early
the other night?

636
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,398
You really want to know?

637
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,550
Well, that is why I asked the question, yeah.

638
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,317
Because that pig ignored me.
He was with Emerald... you know.

639
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,278
So Mr Galliers took you ashore, did he?

640
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,670
- What then? Did he drive you home?
- No, I got a taxi.

641
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,309
- He was gone for more than an hour.
- He is a slow rower.

642
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,392
I have to ask you this.
Did anything happen between you?

643
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,756
Sure, we made love!
It wasn't the first time.

644
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,432
Where was this?

645
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,717
In the dinghy.
Difficult but not impossible.

646
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,592
There was a full moon. Didn't it worry you
that somebody might see you from the yacht?

647
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,511
Maybe that's what I wanted.

648
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,750
Did, er, Mr Buckley see you?

649
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,400
Sure. That's why he don't like me no more.

650
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,879
I don't care.

651
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,111
It would have helped if I had
known this sooner, Miss Olfsberg.

652
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,637
Why? This is my private business.
Nothing to do with what happened.

653
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,349
Well, maybe Mrs Galliers
saw you with her husband.

654
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,396
Maybe they had a quarrel.

655
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,436
And maybe that's when
they went over the side.

656
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,988
That's a lot of maybes.

657
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,036
Well, maybe I'll find some more.

658
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,752
- Cracked it?
- Very funny.

659
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,310
- You've wasted two days on nothing.
- I have not.

660
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,551
I am certain now that Galliers' death
was not an accident.

661
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,598
But his wife's the key witness
but she's on that bloody machine.

662
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,514
And there's no certainty when she
comes off it she'll remember anything.

663
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,632
- Stephen Crane.
- (Jim ) Yeah?

664
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,473
- The Met finally came through with the goods.
- Drugs?

665
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,915
He used to run an art business
in Camden Town.

666
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,197
In 1963, he got two years probation
for possessing cannabis.

667
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,034
In '75, a three-year sentence
for possessing heroin.

668
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,918
He was also charged with dealing
but that was dropped.

669
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,356
(Phone ringing)

670
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,793
Anything else?

671
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,599
Yes. He changed his name when
he left prison when he moved out here.

672
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,752
A new life, I suppose.
He's down on the records as Stephen Axell.

673
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,912
Axell?. Thank you, Charlotte.

674
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,833
Hey, we might
not need Emerald Galliers.

675
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,797
Just as well.

676
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,836
That was the hospital.

677
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,788
Another word, Mr Crane.

678
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,440
- Aren't we on overtime now?
- May I come in?

679
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,511
Yes, but you must promise
to be very quiet.

680
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,353
Norbert's having a lie-down,
he's got a dreadful headache, poor boy.

681
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,476
It's from all that hammering, I suppose.

682
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,239
Why did you change your name
from Axell to Crane?

683
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,995
My, we have been
a busy little bee, haven't we?

684
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,789
- Well, that was... that was just a whim.
- A whim, was it?

685
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,510
Yes, I was working in a library
and I came across this novel,

686
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,036
The Red Badge of Courage
by Stephen Crane.

687
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,351
I thought, "What a lovely name,
that would suit me, " I thought.

688
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,032
Prison library, that would be, would it?

689
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,078
Now we're not going to be
unpleasant again, are we?

690
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,116
You call yourself Crane

691
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,751
because you knew Galliers
would recognise the name Axell.

692
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,037
Oh, you do know
rather a lot, don't you?

693
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,953
Your father stood surety for you in 1963.

694
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,679
He was senior partner in Axell Brown.

695
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,833
And he went out of business
because of Galliers.

696
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,354
It killed Mummy.

697
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,716
They had to sell everything,
including the house which she loved.

698
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,918
- She never got over it.
- All right, so what did you do?

699
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,036
Keep Galliers hooked on drugs?

700
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,588
You bled him white
for the last three years, eh?

701
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,671
He bled my father white.

702
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,718
All right, now tell me
what happened on the yacht.

703
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,998
I've already told you. Good gracious!
You don't think I had anything...

704
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,514
- You had the motive and the opportunity.
- Rubbish!

705
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,196
I didn't want Galliers to die like that,
I hated him too much.

706
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,829
- Oh, you admit that, do you?
- God, how I hated him!

707
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,674
Every time I looked
at a picture of Mummy, I...

708
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:59,154
Sergeant, I wanted to see Galliers
go down into the pits of degradation

709
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:06,032
and I wanted him to die slowly in torment,
screaming like an animal.

710
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,076
That's how it ends, you know.

711
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,116
Yet you still deal in the stuff?

712
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,556
You peddle drugs to Buckley
and any of his mates that want it, don't you?

713
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,871
- Now that you're going to have to prove.
- Oh, I'm going to prove it.

714
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,679
And this time it won't be
a three-year sentence.

715
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,275
I'm going to put you away
for a very, very long time.

716
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,316
Have a good night, Mr Crane.

717
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,596
So you two finally
got to know each other.

718
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,911
Ah, Lil, this is Sam Silvers,
showbiz correspondent.

719
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,197
Oh, good. Do you want me to play the piano
and sing a ditty?

720
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,717
- I'm covering the Buckley story.
- Isn't he rather passé these days?

721
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,155
Old drummers never die. They simply...

722
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,312
Roll away. Excuse me.

723
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,156
Now I'll tell you what you can do for me...

724
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,152
♪ And I can't heLp myself

725
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,028
♪ I'm a fooL in Love with you... ♪

726
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,599
Here he is, Flying Officer Biggles.

727
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,150
- Sam!
- Hello, Boy!

728
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,958
Man, it's good to see you!

729
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,713
- Hey, tell me what you think of this lot.
- I've seen 'em.

730
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,191
Yeah, but the Strappers
were ten times better, Sam.

731
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,794
Who's arguing?

732
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,637
Now what the hell are you doing here,
you old son?

733
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,439
- You want a scoop, right?
- Always.

734
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,193
We're reforming the group, Sam,
how about that?

735
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,352
I've had a long rap with Charlie Walker
and we're back in business.

736
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,955
Only this time we're going to have
our own studio and our own record company.

737
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,393
No rip-offs.

738
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,153
And I got another idea.
I'm gonna get a plane like old Elvis

739
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,438
so we can fly to all the gigs, you know -
Solihull, Dunstable, Tallahassee.

740
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,229
- What about Wayne Roberts?
- Old Wayne will be OK.

741
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,833
Old Wayne's dead, Boy.

742
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,674
He died in that hotel fire six years ago.

743
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,275
What... was that in Honolulu?

744
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,994
- Vegas.
- Yeah.

745
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,036
We had a fire in Honolulu.

746
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,432
That was just your room when you were
zipping matches at the waste bucket.

747
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,159
Vegas was...500 rooms.

748
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,834
Yeah, well, we'll find a lead guitar.
Charlie will know somebody.

749
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,232
Hey, let me fix you a drink, Sam old son.

750
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,470
- What do you want?
- No.

751
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,155
I've got one down the road,
that's what I came to tell you.

752
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,798
Tell me?

753
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,677
Emerald Galliers is OK.

754
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,716
Her parents want you
to have a drink with them.

755
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,552
What do you mean she's OK?

756
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,234
Well, she's off the machine.
She's going to be all right.

757
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,392
The Osmans are over the moon,
I can tell you.

758
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,679
Yeah?

759
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,319
Well, I prayed for her, you know.
I said a prayer.

760
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,789
Well, it must have worked, Boy.

761
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,916
Anyway, are you coming?

762
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,879
Yeah, yeah.

763
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,956
They're in the lounge.

764
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,157
Bergerac.

765
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,557
I've just been to the hospital.

766
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,074
Em told you it was an accident,
didn't she?

767
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,310
I mean, I never mean to hurt her.

768
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,231
- What did you mean to do?
- Look!

769
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,073
Galliers done it to me first,
he was with my woman.

770
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,958
But Em and me, we were just
faking it when he found us.

771
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,679
We were just winding him up,
it was just a gag.

772
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,558
We never expected him
to go crazy like that.

773
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,437
So there was a fight and he went over.

774
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,511
It was an accident, man!
I keep telling you.

775
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,556
And Emerald was another accident, was she?

776
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,312
You're very accident-prone, Mr Buckley.

777
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,757
She... she started screaming,
and I panicked and I just hit her.

778
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,196
Then you just threw her
over the side, did you?

779
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,713
Come on.

780
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,677
I want a brief.

781
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,274
You can only do me for manslaughter.

782
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,999
If Galliers was killed in a fight

783
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,310
you might just get away with manslaughter.

784
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,119
But Emerald Galliers was murdered.

785
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,716
That's right, Mr Buckley, she's dead.
They turned the machine off this evening.

786
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,518
You conning...!

787
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,072
Oh... ow!

788
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,957
- You having trouble, Jim?
- Not with this, no.

789
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,712
Listen, fellas, I can pay!

790
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,759
- I suppose I owe you an apology.
- Yes, yes, you do.

791
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,990
- (Boy ) You can't do this to me.
- I'm sorry.

792
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,799
- Thank you.
- (Boy ) I got lots of money...

793
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,757
- Hey, Sergeant?
- Yeah?

794
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,912
When, er... when did you start sussing Buckley?

795
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,956
Oh, almost from the off.

796
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,349
As soon as his girlfriend
said he was half-deaf.

797
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,431
A lot of drummers are, it's the amplifiers.

798
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,875
And yet he said
he was in the forward guest cabin.

799
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,235
That's about as far away
from the deck as you can get.

800
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,436
Yet he still says he heard a woman cry.

801
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,637
He had to, so he could waste time
with his phoney rescue act.

802
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,712
Can you hold this back?
We've got two days before we go to press.

803
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,155
- Come on.
- Well, can I have an eyewitness piece?

804
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,674
I Was There, by Sam Silvers.

805
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,150
All right, so long as it's not prejudicial
to the trial, you know the form.

806
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,994
Sure. You know, if Reagan doesn't do anything
stupid in the next couple of days,

807
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,959
I might get the front page lead with this.
Happy ending, eh?

808
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,996
Tell that to the Osmans, Mr Silvers.
