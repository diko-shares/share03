00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.994
Let's go!
It's time to move out!

171
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.497
All right.
Everybody grab your gear
and let's get going.

172
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.623
This is it.

173
00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:31.125
Hey, Michael.

174
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:35.003
You know I'm a complete geek
without my BlackBerry
and my cell.

175
00:12:35.088 --> 00:12:37.506
I mean,
there's a good chance
I'll be the first to go.

176
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.427
Oh, come on.
Just change your clothes,
put on some bug spray.

177
00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:44.555
You'll be great,
even without
your CrackBerry.

178
00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:48.350
Okay. I'll do it for you.

179
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:54.106
Okay, but, Mara,
it's "M" now,
not Michael.

180
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.650
Yes. I know.
Okay. Sorry.

181
00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:57.860
Bye.

182
00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:13.709
God. Who am I kidding?

183
00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:17.421
DALE: Okay,
we're moving out.

184
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:21.633
You're all alone out here,
so let's close ranks
and stick together.

185
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:28.849
(WAKE PIG
PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)

186
00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.100
Hey, everyone's leaving.

187
00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:34.563
Hello? Hey.
Everyone's leaving.

188
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:35.814
What?

189
00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.150
We're about to
start the game.
It's time to go.

190
00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.068
Hi, I'm Jake.
You're Nina, right?

191
00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.571
Look, I'm just here
for the money,

192
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.239
not to make friends,
okay?

193
00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:46.742
Wow. Okay.
Fair enough.

194
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.621
Oh, Nina. Nina.

195
00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:54.791
I saw you drop this
while you were
getting out of the RV.

196
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.502
Now M said no food.

197
00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:59.087
(MUSIC STOPS)
Oh, well, I'm vegan.

198
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.049
That might be the
only thing I can eat
out here.

199
00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:04.259
Well, you can always
go chew on a tree.

200
00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.595
This is cheating.

201
00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.516
Sue me. Give it back.
Ah-ah!

202
00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:15.062
I would have,
but since there's no need
to be making friends...

203
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.483
Mmm.

204
00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:22.236
That's good.

205
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.654

M: All right, everybody.
Ready?

207
00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:30.786
And action, Dale!

208
00:14:31.538 --> 00:14:34.164
DALE: You cannot survive
the apocalypse alone,

209
00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:37.709
so you make friendships,
perform tasks together.

210
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:41.046
You figure out
who you need to
ride out the chaos

211
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.673
and who's expendable.

212
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.592
Today we're going to split
into three teams,

213
00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:47.678
go out and search for food.

214
00:14:47.762 --> 00:14:51.098
The number
each of you picked
decides your teammate.

all the way, baby.

217

You and me, baby,
all the way.

218
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:00.732
Who's got a number two?

219
00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:03.068
Well, I did a number two
back at the gas station.

220

(JONESY LAUGHS)

221
00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:06.655
Come on, dude.
That was funny.

222
00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:12.327
Oh, sweet.

223
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.622
I guess you and me
are a team. Hello?

224
00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:16.832
All right,
boys and girls.

225
00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.252
It's the end of the world
and the odds are against you
from the start.

226
00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:23.380
Radiation poisoning
is a reality.

227
00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:25.424
That's why you're all
wearing these.

228
00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:29.094
Every day you will be given
a Radiation Elimination Card

229
00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:31.305
and one of them
is already contaminated.

(RADIATION DETECTOR CLICKING)

231
00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.890
At the end of the day,

232
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.936
the player holding
the simulated
radiated card is dead.

233
00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:41.481
Don't worry,
it just means
you're disqualified.

234
00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:43.692
But you have a chance
to survive the day

235
00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.361
by giving your card
to another player

236
00:15:46.446 --> 00:15:49.531
and surviving
the Radiation Elimination.

237
00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:55.120
It's a test
of your personal will,
your endurance and fate.

238
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:56.913
And in the apocalypse,

239
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.208
(SNAPS FINGERS)
your fate can change
like that.

240

Wild animals,
bacterial infection,

241
00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:06.757
and post-apocalyptic crazies
are all around you

242
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.844
waiting to take you down.
They're represented

243
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:13.847

We call them Twists of Fate.
They are survival challenges

245
00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:22.397
and dozens of them
are scattered all over
the playing area.

246
00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:25.651
You trigger
the motion sensor
and you hear this...

Accomplish the challenge

251
00:16:37.372 --> 00:16:40.499
and you earn the right
to take your radiated card

252
00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:45.045
and give it to any player
you choose and automatically
survive the day.

We are going to
assemble back here
at 1800 hours

254

and see who will perish
in the chaos and who is
one step closer to $100,000.

Good luck to all of you.

to work as a team

into it?

if we lose the
elimination round?

and you drown your sorrows

might not take that talk
too well.

made of leather?

I'm not a hypocrite.

No, I didn't think
that you were.

Actually, being vegan
is why you got picked
to be on the show.

M thought that
there wouldn't be a lot
for you to eat out here

resort to gulping down

They're pretty idiotic.

329

Then why are you
doing this?

Because it's my job.

and I'm just trying
to be supportive.

I would've said,
"This sucks.
You're on your own. "

Come on.
No, you wouldn't.

335
00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:37.212
Yeah, I would.
If you haven't noticed,
I can be a bit of a bitch.

reality shows, then

How about you?

687
00:52:04.038 --> 00:52:05.872
Well, when I win,

688
00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:08.082
I plan on getting
my degree in
sports medicine.

689
00:52:08.542 --> 00:52:10.919
Since my arm won't let me
play football anymore,

690
00:52:11.003 --> 00:52:13.671
I figure I can still
help others, you know,
stay in the game.

691
00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:17.842
Can't be a football hero,
so you'll settle for
a hero of any kind.

692
00:52:18.052 --> 00:52:20.136
Yeah, something like that.

693
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:23.181
Nice to know
there's still hope
for mankind.

694

Dude, if you're saying
this to get in her pants,
forget about it.

695
00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:28.102
She doesn't play
on our team.

696
00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:29.187
Shut up.

697
00:52:29.271 --> 00:52:32.607
How about you?
What you plan on
doing with the cash?

698
00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:35.026
I owe my father
a bunch of money.

699
00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:38.112
If I win,
I am free and clear
of him for good.

700
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:40.114
Your father?

701
00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:42.492
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle.

702
00:52:42.576 --> 00:52:44.160
Wants nothing
to do with me.

703
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:45.453
Hmm.

704

choose family.

Man, M is so screwed.

He wanted a show
for middle America,
but he hired a lesbo,

a sensitive jock,
a bi-polar vegan,

708
00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.676

and Miss Hollywood.

get out of here!

What?

okay? Who?

What are you talking about?

722
00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:28.037
These hillbilly freaks.
They killed Mara

723
00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:31.040
and they tied her
to the hood of
their truck.

are roaming through

are out there?

you run across,
that's for sure.

and a lot stronger.

and just kept going.

changed them.

near 30 years ago,

842
00:59:44.665 --> 00:59:50.086
and left a mess,
and the poison
killed off all the game.

843
00:59:50.337 --> 00:59:53.214
Most of the folks
around these parts left.

844
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:58.010
There's one family
stayed on in this holler,

845
00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.975
and pretty soon their
babies started gushing
out of their mama's womb,

have kids of their own,

for a bite?

head out to get your friends,
settle the score,
