1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,039
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:07,475
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

3
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:09,041
And what about for her?

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,417
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

5
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:23,058
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

6
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,495
Limbo became her reality.

7
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:31,630
What happened when you woke up?

8
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:35,836
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

9
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:41,409
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

10
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:46,079
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

11
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:49,714
Eventually, she told me the truth.

12
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:53,519
She was possessed by an idea.

13
00:00:53,683 --> 00:00:59,393
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

14
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:02,994
That our world wasn't real.

15
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:08,201
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

16
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,102
...that in order to get back home...

17
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,137
...we had to kill ourselves.

18
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:24,249
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

19
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:27,417
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

20
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,285
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.

21
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,719
I can tell the difference.

22
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:33,223
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

23
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:35,090
You don't know you're dreaming!

24
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:37,460
She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

25
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:41,466
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

26
00:01:44,432 --> 00:01:47,471
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

27
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:53,547
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversay.

28
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,004
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

29
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:27,443
Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

30
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:32,048
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

31
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:33,914
No, I'm not.

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,184
Now, you listen to me.

33
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:41,024
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

34
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:43,124
Now, just step back inside.

35
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,027
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

36
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:48,128
We've talked enough.

37
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:51,865
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

38
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:54,736
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

39
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,807
We're gonna talk about this.

40
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:02,842
All right?

41
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:08,084
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

42
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:12,052
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

43
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,988
Take a second, think about our children.

44
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,890
Think about James.

45
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:19,257
Think about Phillipa, now.

46
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,362
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

47
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:25,833
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

48
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:29,602
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

49
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,973
How you've threatened to kill me.

50
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:39,411
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

51
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,346
Why did...? Why would you do this to me?

52
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:44,383
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

53
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:47,587
We're going home to our real children.

54
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:51,390
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

55
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:52,857
You're waiting for a train.

56
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:56,930
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

57
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,097
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

58
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:03,103
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

59
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,470
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

60
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:08,841
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

61
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:12,846
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

62
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:14,445
Jesus Christ!

63
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:21,688
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

64
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:26,059
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

65
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:27,457
So I ran.

66
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,528
Right now, or never, Cobb.

67
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:42,541
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

68
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:43,872
All right, let's go.

69
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:48,212
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

70
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:52,651
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

71
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:56,120
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

72
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:59,923
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

73
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:05,064
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

74
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:07,063
But you don't have to do that alone.

75
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:09,498
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

76
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:15,274
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

77
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,843
We have to move.

78
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,444
Time's up.

79
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,348
All right. I don't know any combination.

80
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:29,618
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

81
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:33,723
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

82
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:36,791
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

83
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:39,194
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

84
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:41,596
I said, right now! Right now!

85
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:45,668
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

86
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:51,537
You'll have to do better than that.

87
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:55,043
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

88
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:03,552
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

89
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,323
What'd you get?

90
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:13,259
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

91
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:14,460
This helps us how?

92
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:17,732
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

93
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,036
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

94
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,740
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

95
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:29,477
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

96
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,609
Damn it.

97
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,780
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

98
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,532
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

99
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:32,438
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his...

100
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,905
...father whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

101
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,376
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

102
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,911
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

103
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:43,581
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

104
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,414
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

105
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:49,120
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

106
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:51,388
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

107
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:53,890
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.

108
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,562
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

109
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:59,762
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

110
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:02,032
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.

111
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:04,401
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

112
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:06,635
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

113
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:09,273
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

114
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:17,181
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

115
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:20,652
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

116
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:22,617
- You ready?
- Ready!

117
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:24,953
Sweet dreams.

118
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,022
Am I boring you?

119
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:31,528
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

120
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:36,032
I have a lot on my mind.

121
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:39,166
There goes Mr. Charles.

122
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,507
Mr. Fischer, right?

123
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:50,179
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing.

124
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:54,316
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

125
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,685
In case you get bored.

126
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,293
Must've blown you off.

127
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,196
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

128
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:14,804
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

129
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:21,074
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500...

130
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,375
About $500, right?

131
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,513
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

132
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:27,614
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

133
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:31,519
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

134
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:33,018
And why don't you approve?

135
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:35,187
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

136
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:37,491
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

137
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:40,594
Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

138
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:42,528
So now you've noticed how much time...

139
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:45,331
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

140
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:48,835
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,437
- I'm sorry, but...
- Hold on! Wait!

142
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,072
You look a bit perkier.

143
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:56,575
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

144
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,316
Turbulence on the plane?

145
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:06,184
No, it's much closer.

146
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:08,020
That's Yusuf's driving.

147
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,832
I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

148
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:21,100
Rod Green from marketing.

149
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:22,867
But that's not true at all, is it?

150
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:28,441
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

151
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:30,608
I'm the head of your security down here.

152
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:33,811
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

153
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:36,314
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

154
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,986
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

155
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,189
Security, huh?

156
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:49,794
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

157
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,567
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

158
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:56,633
Subconscious security.

159
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:58,902
You're talking about dreams?

160
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,939
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

161
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:04,374
I am here to protect you.

162
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:20,356
Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...

163
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:23,895
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

164
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,696
You're not safe here.

165
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,132
They're coming for you.

166
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,518
Strange weather, isn't it?

167
00:11:54,354 --> 00:11:55,489
You feel that?

168
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,660
What's happening?

169
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:02,064
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

170
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:05,100
...which is making his subconscious
Iook for the dreamer.

171
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:08,336
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

172
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,213
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

173
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:19,914
We should probably get out of here.

174
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:38,767
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

175
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,937
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

176
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:46,273
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

177
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:53,313
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

178
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:57,586
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

179
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,718
Yeah, I...

180
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,422
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

181
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:07,763
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

182
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,768
- You're not real?
- No.

183
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:19,306
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

184
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,574
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

185
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:24,644
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

186
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:28,047
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

187
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:30,180
Yeah.

188
00:13:30,347 --> 00:13:31,449
Okay.

189
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:33,584
Okay.

190
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,422
Can you get me out of here?

191
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:41,927
Right away. Follow me.

192
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,474
Hold on a second.

193
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:04,248
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

194
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,684
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

195
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,420
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

196
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:13,457
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

197
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:28,773
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

198
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:31,040
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

199
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,712
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

200
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:36,044
...you may not wake up.

201
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:41,486
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

202
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,488
You remember the training.

203
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:48,024
Remember what I said to you.

204
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,058
Give me the gun.

205
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,474
- This room should be directly below 52$?
- Yeah.

206
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:15,350
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

207
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:19,356
What do you remember
from before this dream?

208
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,357
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

209
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,126
There was rain.

210
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,262
Uncle Peter.

211
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,166
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

212
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,471
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

213
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,741
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

214
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,176
It had something to do with...

215
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,680
Something to do with a safe.

216
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,947
God, why is it so hard to remember?

217
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,817
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

218
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:52,719
Listen, it takes years of practice.

219
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,290
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

220
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,225
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

221
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,963
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

222
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,762
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

223
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,670
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

224
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,571
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

225
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:14,509
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

226
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:18,445
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

227
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:21,448
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

228
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:22,947
Five.

229
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:26,353
Five, two... It was something,
it was a long number.

230
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,621
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

231
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:29,821
Yep.

232
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:34,028
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

233
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,496
While you're all asleep in 52$,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

234
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,799
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

235
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:43,905
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

236
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:47,273
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

237
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:49,841
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

238
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:53,279
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

239
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:57,249
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

240
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:00,620
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

241
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:08,492
They're with me. Go on.

242
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:33,850
Mr. Charles.

243
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:36,988
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

244
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:39,222
They were trying to put you under.

245
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:41,724
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

246
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:44,462
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

247
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,531
Hey. I see you've changed.

248
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:49,331
I'm sorry?

249
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:53,705
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

250
00:17:55,302 --> 00:17:57,440
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

251
00:17:58,105 --> 00:18:01,044
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

252
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,078
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

253
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:05,213
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

254
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:08,718
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

255
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:16,992
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

256
00:18:17,157 --> 00:18:20,596
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

257
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:22,230
And you saw them torture him?

258
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,607
The kidnappers are working for you?

259
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,042
Robert.

260
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:38,048
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

261
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:42,685
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

262
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,221
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

263
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:49,558
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

264
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:53,395
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

265
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,496
That's his last insult.

266
00:18:55,661 --> 00:18:59,300
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

267
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:03,271
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

268
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:14,318
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

269
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,786
But he's wrong.

270
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:22,155
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

271
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,757
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

272
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:27,027
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

273
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:29,963
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

274
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:34,568
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

275
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:41,209
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

276
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,942
All right.

277
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:51,182
- He's out.
- Wait.

278
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:53,418
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

279
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:54,919
We're going into Fischer's.

280
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,790
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

281
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:00,292
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

282
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:02,026
That's right.

283
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,262
Security's gonna run you down hard.

284
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:06,764
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

285
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,968
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

286
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,374
You good?

287
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,877
Hey. You ready?

288
00:20:21,044 --> 00:20:24,651
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

289
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,528
Cobb?

290
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,632
Cobb? What's down there?

291
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,605
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

292
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:49,672
I mean, what's down there for you?

293
00:23:26,256 --> 00:23:28,026
Did you see that?

294
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,345
Eames, this is your dream.

295
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:51,617
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

296
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:53,583
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.

297
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:56,220
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

298
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:58,923
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

299
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:00,623
I could do it.

300
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:03,493
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

301
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:07,866
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

302
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,868
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

303
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:15,173
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

304
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:16,639
You're not coming in?

305
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:19,142
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

306
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:22,346
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

307
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,681
Come on, Fischer!

308
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:23,438
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

309
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:25,138
Move!

310
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:27,739
Go!

311
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:43,989
Sod it.

312
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,836
I hope you're ready.

313
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:07,346
No, it's too soon.

314
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,053
Cobb, do you hear that?

315
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:18,793
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.

316
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:21,828
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

317
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:23,394
So, what do we do?

318
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,963
We move fast.

319
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,704
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

320
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:36,942
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

321
00:26:37,874 --> 00:26:39,978
- Hey!
- That's him!

322
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:42,380
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

323
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:45,818
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

324
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:48,854
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

325
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:01,698
It's designed as a labyrinth.

326
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:04,335
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

327
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,102
Eames?

328
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,459
Did Eames add any features?

329
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,095
I don't think I should tell you.

330
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,564
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

331
00:27:34,996 --> 00:27:37,768
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

332
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:39,134
Good. Explain it to them.

333
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,536
- Saito?
- Go ahead.

334
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,436
Paradox.

335
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:27,373
- What was that?
- The kick.

336
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:29,874
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

337
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,743
Yeah, we missed it.

338
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,110
Man.

339
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:37,585
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach?

340
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,920
Well, what the hell do we do now?

341
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:43,922
We finish the job before the next kick.

342
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:46,191
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

343
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:12,483
If you'd like to
make a call, please hang up and ty again.

344
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:14,485
If you need help, hang up...

345
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:18,024
How do I drop you without gravity?

346
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:23,195
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

347
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,284
You okay?

348
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:56,628
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

349
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:58,327
Go, go, go!

350
00:31:00,495 --> 00:31:01,663
There's something wrong.

351
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:04,166
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

352
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,637
Just buy us more time, all right?

353
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,639
- Come on!
- On my way.

354
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,506
Come on! Move!

355
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,222
All right.

356
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,205
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

357
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:55,875
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

358
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,277
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

359
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,249
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

360
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:06,787
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

361
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,812
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

362
00:33:34,977 --> 00:33:36,814
There's an entire army headed your way.

363
00:34:03,638 --> 00:34:05,007
I'm in.

364
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:11,446
There he is.

365
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,725
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

366
00:34:57,891 --> 00:35:00,463
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

367
00:35:06,198 --> 00:35:07,366
Cobb.

368
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:10,538
No, she is not real.

369
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:12,371
How do you know that?

370
00:35:12,538 --> 00:35:16,178
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

371
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:21,714
Hello.

372
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:29,591
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

373
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:16,369
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

374
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,672
I couldn't shoot her.

375
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:24,711
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

376
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:25,943
It's all over.

377
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:29,312
So that's it, then? We failed?

378
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,116
We're done. I'm sorry.

379
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:38,623
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

380
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:43,228
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

381
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,462
Let's set the charges.

382
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:48,798
No, there's still another way.

383
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,506
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

384
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,508
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

385
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,742
And we will find him.

386
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:02,849
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

387
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,917
We can give him his own kick
down below.

388
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:08,651
Look, you get him in there.

389
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:11,688
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

390
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:14,658
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

391
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:20,633
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

392
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:22,899
Saito will never make it, will he?

393
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:27,404
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

394
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:30,507
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

395
00:37:30,672 --> 00:37:33,911
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

396
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:40,350
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

397
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:41,716
Mal's gonna be down there.

398
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:44,320
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

399
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:48,391
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

400
00:37:48,555 --> 00:37:50,725
She wants me back down there with her.

401
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:18,518
All right?

402
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:28,429
- This is your world?
- It was.

403
00:38:29,228 --> 00:38:31,165
And this is where she'll be.

404
00:38:31,964 --> 00:38:33,466
Come on.

405
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:22,415
Saito. Saito.

406
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:26,820
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

407
00:39:26,984 --> 00:39:30,423
No room for tourists on these jobs.

408
00:39:33,057 --> 00:39:34,225
Don't be silly.

409
00:40:06,722 --> 00:40:08,792
You built all this? This is incredible.

410
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:11,295
We built for years.

411
00:40:12,328 --> 00:40:14,331
Then we started in on the memories.

412
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:22,772
This way.

413
00:41:04,444 --> 00:41:06,548
This was our neighborhood.

414
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:09,051
Places from our past.

415
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,985
That was our first apartment.

416
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,389
Then we moved to that building
right there.

417
00:41:13,553 --> 00:41:16,090
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

418
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:19,061
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

419
00:41:19,225 --> 00:41:21,496
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

420
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,263
What is that?

421
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,567
That's the house Mal grew up in.

422
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:29,170
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

423
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,536
Come on.

424
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:34,042
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

425
00:41:34,207 --> 00:41:37,146
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

426
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:19,752
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

427
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:22,589
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

428
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:24,155
What?

429
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:26,258
I'm gonna improvise.

430
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:31,100
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

431
00:42:44,174 --> 00:42:48,048
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

432
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:50,448
Highly contagious.

433
00:42:50,614 --> 00:42:53,953
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

434
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:56,988
It can grow to define...

435
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:59,590
...or destroy you.

436
00:43:02,725 --> 00:43:05,497
The smallest idea, such as:

437
00:43:06,096 --> 00:43:08,467
"Your world is not real."

438
00:43:08,731 --> 00:43:12,505
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

439
00:43:13,736 --> 00:43:18,244
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

440
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:20,210
Do you think he is?

441
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:24,916
Or do you think he's as lost as l was?

442
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:27,550
I know what's real, Mal.

443
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:31,921
No creeping doubts?

444
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,258
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

445
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:36,892
Chased around the globe...

446
00:43:37,058 --> 00:43:39,730
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

447
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:42,532
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

448
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:45,635
Admit it.

449
00:43:46,935 --> 00:43:49,774
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

450
00:43:49,938 --> 00:43:51,473
So choose.

451
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:53,909
Choose to be here.

452
00:43:54,409 --> 00:43:55,912
Choose me.

453
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:23,036
You know what I have to do.

454
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,875
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

455
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,742
Because you left us.

456
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:30,711
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

457
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:32,913
You're confused.

458
00:44:34,013 --> 00:44:36,083
Our children are here.

459
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:40,121
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

460
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:43,358
Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

461
00:44:57,003 --> 00:44:59,006
Up above?

462
00:44:59,904 --> 00:45:03,544
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

463
00:45:04,075 --> 00:45:05,445
Watch.

464
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:07,647
James? Phillipa?

465
00:45:07,812 --> 00:45:10,249
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

466
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,887
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

467
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:14,954
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

468
00:45:15,353 --> 00:45:17,658
What if I'm what's real?

469
00:45:18,857 --> 00:45:21,094
You keep telling yourself what you know.

470
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,898
But what do you believe?

471
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:27,099
What do you feel?

472
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:30,669
Guilt.

473
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:34,106
I feel guilt, Mal.

474
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,580
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

475
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:43,016
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

476
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,718
...reminding me of the truth.

477
00:45:46,216 --> 00:45:47,518
What truth?

478
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:55,196
That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

479
00:45:58,562 --> 00:46:01,701
You planted the idea in my mind?

480
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,702
What is she talking about?

481
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:10,878
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

482
00:46:11,908 --> 00:46:14,880
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

483
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:17,114
We were lost in here.

484
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:22,688
I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

485
00:46:25,887 --> 00:46:31,565
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

486
00:46:32,328 --> 00:46:36,469
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

487
00:46:37,433 --> 00:46:39,570
And she couldn't break free.

488
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:45,009
So I decided to search for it.

489
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:50,450
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

490
00:46:50,612 --> 00:46:52,515
And I broke in...

491
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:55,251
...and I planted an idea.

492
00:46:55,984 --> 00:46:59,757
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

493
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:07,364
That her world wasn't real.

494
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:23,380
That death was the only escape.

495
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:32,554
You're waiting for a train.

496
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:37,593
A train that'll take you far away.

497
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:41,764
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

498
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:44,899
...but you can't know for sure.

499
00:47:46,065 --> 00:47:47,600
Yet it doesn't matter.

500
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:52,207
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

501
00:47:56,543 --> 00:48:00,617
But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

502
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,184
...that even after she woke...

503
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:08,556
That even after
you came back to reality...

504
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,462
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

505
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:19,633
That death was the only escape.

506
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:22,470
Mal, no! Jesus!

507
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:26,341
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

508
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:27,907
You betrayed me.

509
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,447
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

510
00:48:32,611 --> 00:48:35,650
We can still be together, right here...

511
00:48:35,814 --> 00:48:38,285
...in the world we built together.

512
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:01,431
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

513
00:50:02,297 --> 00:50:03,600
You can't have him.

514
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:08,072
- If I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

515
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,377
Fischer is on the porch.

516
00:50:14,943 --> 00:50:17,547
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

517
00:50:17,712 --> 00:50:20,350
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

518
00:50:35,996 --> 00:50:39,102
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

519
00:50:39,266 --> 00:50:42,940
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

520
00:50:45,505 --> 00:50:48,210
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

521
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:51,881
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

522
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,986
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

523
00:50:57,149 --> 00:51:00,556
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

524
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:02,056
No.

525
00:51:03,222 --> 00:51:04,658
I wish.

526
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:08,763
I wish more than anything, but...

527
00:51:09,863 --> 00:51:12,601
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

528
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:15,303
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

529
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:17,437
- You all right?
- Yeah.

530
00:51:17,603 --> 00:51:19,440
Look at you.

531
00:51:20,673 --> 00:51:25,616
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

532
00:51:26,044 --> 00:51:28,682
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

533
00:51:29,515 --> 00:51:31,952
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

534
00:51:32,117 --> 00:51:33,753
Does this feel real?

535
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:38,759
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

536
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:49,068
No, no, no!

537
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:52,439
In there, now. Go, go, go.

538
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,183
I was dis...

539
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:43,221
I was dis... Disa...

540
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:46,624
- I know, Dad.
- Dis...

541
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,732
I know you were disappointed...

542
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:56,900
...I couldn't be you.

543
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,802
No.

544
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,537
No, no, no.

545
00:53:01,571 --> 00:53:03,574
I was disappointed...

546
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,244
...that you tried.

547
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:32,168
What?

548
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:42,744
Come on, come on.

549
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:14,475
Dad?

550
00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:55,883
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

551
00:55:08,726 --> 00:55:12,166
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

552
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,000
I will!

553
00:55:53,737 --> 00:55:56,909
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

554
00:55:57,073 --> 00:55:58,175
Yes.

555
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,412
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

556
00:56:04,114 --> 00:56:05,616
But we did.

557
00:56:07,549 --> 00:56:09,921
We did. You don't remember?

558
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,429
I miss you more than I can bear...

559
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:21,798
...but we had our time together.

560
00:56:23,132 --> 00:56:25,202
And I have to let you go.

561
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:29,105
I have to let you go.

562
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,656
I'm sorry, Robert.

563
00:57:49,316 --> 00:57:52,989
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

564
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,090
...not just to live for him.

565
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,227
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

566
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:11,237
What happened?

567
00:58:11,703 --> 00:58:13,406
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

568
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:14,839
No, to find Saito.

569
00:58:17,108 --> 00:58:18,878
He'll be lost.

570
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:23,249
No, he'll be all right.

571
00:58:39,264 --> 00:58:41,234
Have you come to kill me?

572
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:47,973
I'm waiting for someone.

573
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:55,214
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

574
00:58:57,948 --> 00:58:59,350
Cobb?

575
00:59:01,285 --> 00:59:03,055
Impossible.

576
00:59:03,586 --> 00:59:06,191
We were young men together.

577
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:10,128
I'm an old man.

578
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:13,431
Filled with regret.

579
00:59:16,566 --> 00:59:19,270
Waiting to die alone.

580
00:59:22,438 --> 00:59:24,609
I've come back for you.

581
00:59:27,877 --> 00:59:31,750
To remind you of something.

582
00:59:35,017 --> 00:59:37,388
Something you once knew.

583
00:59:40,256 --> 00:59:42,493
That this world is not real.

584
00:59:47,396 --> 00:59:51,904
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

585
00:59:52,734 --> 00:59:55,505
To take a leap of faith, yes.

586
01:00:01,609 --> 01:00:02,945
Come back...

587
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,853
...so we can be
young men together again.

588
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:14,590
Come back with me.

589
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:19,126
Come back.

590
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:30,571
Hot towel, sir?

591
01:00:31,205 --> 01:00:34,077
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

592
01:00:34,241 --> 01:00:36,545
Do you need immigration forms?

593
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:39,980
Thank you.

594
01:00:40,447 --> 01:00:42,082
Hot towel, sir?

595
01:00:43,082 --> 01:00:46,087
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

596
01:01:57,455 --> 01:01:58,523
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

597
01:01:59,656 --> 01:02:01,292
Thank you, sir.

598
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:46,704
Welcome.

599
01:02:47,169 --> 01:02:48,572
This way.

600
01:03:09,757 --> 01:03:13,230
James? Phillipa?

601
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:18,232
Look who's here.

602
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:24,906
Hey.

603
01:03:26,007 --> 01:03:28,711
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!

604
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,146
- Daddy!
- How are you?

605
01:03:32,246 --> 01:03:33,848
Look what I've been building!

606
01:03:34,014 --> 01:03:37,721
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!

607
01:03:37,884 --> 01:03:40,756
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

608
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,493
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!

609
01:03:44,364 --> 01:04:14,365
