00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,812
We'll take this floor first.

178
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,605
[police] Take it easy, ma'am.

179
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,691
[China] We'll go upstairs after.

180
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,361
What's going on?
Have you arrested Roberto?

181
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,573
Read the warrant, ma'am.

182
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,749
[police] Good morning, Mrs. Samira Rangel?

183
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,960
-[Samira] Yes.
-I'm agent Bastos.

184
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,504
-I have a warrant to search this property.
-[Samira] What?

185
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,590
[Vander] It's a warrant, ma'am,

186
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,259
against your husband, João Pedro Rangel.

187
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,887
How many people in the house?

188
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,724
Me, my husband and my grandson,
who is sleeping over.

189
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,350
[Samira] What are you looking for?

190
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,522
What do you want, for heaven's sake?
If you tell me, maybe I can help.

191
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,481
Calm down.

192
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,233
-[Bastos] What's your name?
-Cibele.

193
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,360
[Bastos] Cibele, can you bring
the boy down here? [Samira] Wait a minute. Why can't I go?

194
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,073
Mrs. Rangel, anybody else in the house?

195
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:08,991
[Samira] No.

196
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,493
-[Vander] Are you sure?
-Yes.

197
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,746
-[Rangel] What's going on?
-[Samira] Take a look!

198
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,084
-Mr. João Pedro Rangel?
-[Rangel] Yes.

199
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,586
Good morning.

200
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,004
That's a search warrant.

201
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:24,924
Where's the Evoque?

202
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,011
-[Vander] Is it in the garage?
-Yes, it is.

203
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,972
Can you take us to your car, please, sir?

204
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,849
We need the registration, please.

205
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,518
Come on.

206
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,146
[Vander] Can you come with me,
Mrs. Rangel?

207
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,734
-[Vander] Is there a safe in the house?
-[Samira] No, there isn't.

208
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,985
[Vander] Valuable objects?

209
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,113
Where do you keep them?

210
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,407
Everything we have is out in the open.

211
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,243
So this is it then?

212
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,454
We have nothing to hide.

213
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,456
OK.

214
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,041
Please stay with me.

215
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,800
I don't know what you expect to find.
The car's papers are in order.

216
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,764
If you say so.
Then you won't have any problems.

217
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,147
Nice painting.

218
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,691
It's a photograph.

219
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:34,868
[he taps the wall]

220
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,016
[cellphone vibrates]

221
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,985
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi. Let me talk to Ricky.

-Is he there?

00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,321
[Shayenne] <i>What's wrong?</i>

224
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,824
-Pass me to him, Shayenne!
-Mom, talk to me!

225
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
Why won't you talk to me?

226
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,246
[rock music plays over stereo]

00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,543

00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,299
[he exhales deeply]

230
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,971
Mom. Calm down. I'm about to hand
the phone to Ricky. Ricky?

231
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,224
Something's going on at my mother's place.
She'll only talk to you.

232
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,643
Take it, Ricky!

233
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,857
-Hi, Samira.
-Ricky, was it a robbery? Ask her.

234
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,235
They police are all over the house.
They're asking about the car.

235
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,321
Calm down, Samira. Calm down.

236
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,947
-Ask her about Paulinho?
-No, Shayenne.

237
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,699
-Is he OK?
-He's fine. Calm down.

238
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,911
-Ask her about my father.
-Hurry over to João Pedro's office.

-[Ricky] <i>Calm down!</i>

241
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,085
Go to the office and remove everything.
Go now.

242
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,378
-Samira, owning a new car is not a crime!
-Ricky?

243
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,024

[elevator bell rings]

247
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:10,107
Forget it. This kind of lock
means we have to break in.

248
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,775
The director of Petrobrasil.

249
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,902
No. We better go get a key.

["Gold" by Chet Faker]

251
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,177
I wouldn't bet on getting an agreement.

252
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,681
Who says I'm gonna need one, dear Verena?

253
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,808
[phone rings]

254
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,650
Hey! Do we have JPR?

255
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,280
Great.

256
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,491
[Verena] Good job. Way to go.

257
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,289
Once we've nailed JPR,
it's goodbye Ibrahim.

258
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,670
This time I'm pretty thrilled to book
you and you do the time you deserve.

259
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:54,920
Why don't you answer your fucking
phone? Did you hear about Ibrahim?

260
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,713
Fuck me!

261
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,676
I'm telling you, if they come after me,
I'll kill that fucking Lebanese.

262
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,427
Is it all there?

263
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,681
I can't take much more.

264
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,808
[Juliano] There's not much to do now
except wait.

265

266
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,270
[woman] Euros, dollars, reais, right?

267
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,396
Who cares?

<i>Vander! Let's go.</i>

274
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,157
What's going on, Ricky?
I have a right to know the truth.

275
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,535
Nothing's going on.
Nothing you need to worry about.

276
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,788
-Really?
-A little trouble at the office.

277
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,874
Some auditors are demanding access
to your father's paperwork.

278
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,209
Which auditors? What paperwork?

279
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:01,671
Oh, Shayenne. Listen, we have to go
to your father's office right now.

280
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,841
There's no way I'm going to my father's
office. I'm going to pick up our son.

281
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,513
Listen to me. I can't do this
without you. It's urgent.

282
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,723
What about Paulinho?

283
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,059
I want you to come.

284
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,789
Mr. João Pedro?

285
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,964
I need the keys to your office.

286
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,007
If you please.

287
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,066
You have to come with us.

288
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,869
[Rangel] Why can't the chief come here
to my house? He'll be very welcome.

289
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,370
[Vander] That's not how it works.

290
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,289
How does it work?
What does he want to know?

291
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,999
He just wants to ask you a few questions.

292
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,461
What kind of questions?
It's about the car, right?

293
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,880
Sir, he'll talk to you
down at headquarters.

294
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,425
Pepê, you'll have to calm down.
I'll call Agostini, he'll take care of it.

295
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,178
Right, sir.
If you'll please, get in the car.

296
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,679
It's time we got going.

297
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,647

Ricky, where in hell do I start?

304
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,215
Come on, Shayenne! Hurry it up!

305
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,508
But what do you need?

306
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,719
Everything. Dump whatever
you find in the bag.

307
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,305
That's what I'm doing,
but it doesn't make a lot of sense.

308
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,067
[Ricky] Let's go, honey. Come on.

309
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,571
I even grabbed a bunch of old phone bills.

310
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,865
[Ricky] Great. Throw them in
with everything else.

311

Hurry!

Come on.

[Ricky] Let's go.

315
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,843
Call the elevator.

316
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,430
[Ricky] Be careful, honey.

317
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,560
Calm down, Ricky.

318
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,980
Here it goes.

321
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,568
[Ricky] Go.

00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,326
[elevator bell]

323
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,380
Mr. Rangel, as Petrobrasil's CEO,
are you aware

324
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:39,759
there's a money laundering scheme
involving your company and run by...

325
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,431
Roberto Ibrahim, the currency dealer,
with a number of corrupt public officials?

326
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,267
No.

327
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:52,355
[agent] Are you aware of a pool
of contractors enjoying illegal benefits

328
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,818
in bidding for construction work
at the Antônio &amp; Lima refinery?

329
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,362
No.

330
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,949
Mr. Rangel, have you ever been arrested?

331
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,703
Never.

332
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,901
Is this over?

333
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,615
Well, may I now please go home?

334
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,743
Yes, sir. You may go home.

335
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:02,300
Whose brilliant idea was it to serve
a warrant on João Pedro Rangel?

336
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,178
-How come I knew nothing about it?
-I didn't know about it either.

337
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,306
[Roberval] Her fucking cell phone
goes straight to voice-mail.

338
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,518
-What's wrong with that woman?
-She's probably flying down here.

339
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,479
The unit got to JPR's office
and there was nothing there.

340
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,316
I couldn't be happier. Serves them right!
It's obvious they'd find nothing.

341
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,902
That's not how things fucking work!

342
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,071
She kept me in the dark about this.

343
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,031
The girl's not right in the head.

344
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,784
Verena's a fucking embarrassment.

345
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,620
I'm telling you,
she can dig her own way out of this.

346
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,915
-Glass of water, Chief?
-[Roberval] Please. No ice.

347
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,458
Excuse me.

348
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,255
[Verena] Leave it there.

349
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:45,593
There are more boxes coming in.
You can place them on the shelves.

350
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,513
Leave those by the bags, right? Yeah.

351
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,806
That's it.

352
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,267
[Verena] Take those with the other boxes.

353
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,061
Hey. Thanks.

354
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,651
Good afternoon, everyone.
My congratulations.

355
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,945
Three exchange dealers
and considerable capital.

356
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,490
Well done, China. In the end,
everything worked out just fine.

357
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,659
I'm really proud of you. Job well done.

358
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,704
Now I need to have a private word
with Chief Verena.

359
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,788
Thank you.

360
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,418
Shouldn't take long.

361
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,502
[Roberval clears throat]

362
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,137
That means you too, Vander.

363
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,857
-You're not authorized to do this.
-The operation was authorized.

364
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,068
You had João Pedro Rangel questioned
and came up with a fat nothing.

365
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,403
For now, but that will change.

366
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,741
You went behind my back to come up
with a subpoena. I won't forget that.

367
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,327
-You messed up. Oh, yes, you did.
-I didn't mess up.

368
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,620
I'm taking you off the case.

369
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,372
You're just like Ruffo
and you'll end up like he did.

370
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,249
Those boxes?
They're packed with paperwork

371
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,461
we took off the exchange dealers.
It's scary what's in there.

372
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,547
If you wanna take me off the case,
you better get rid of it.

373
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,799
Otherwise it could be
very embarrassing for you.

374
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,135
You don't want to look like
a horse's ass, do you?

375
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,137
Excuse me.

376
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,107
[Ricky] Relax, it's gonna be fine.

377
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,405
They've got nothing on us now.

378
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,834
I have faith in our justice system.

379
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,109
[door locks]

380
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,452
[keys rattle, door unlocks]

381
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,714
[door locks]

382
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,717
Beats your hotel room.

383
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,241
Ibra! So nice to see you.

384
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,873
[door unlocks]

385
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,924
[door closes and locks]

386
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:47,126
How come didn't they leave a guard
at the office? It doesn't make sense.

387
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,213
We're missing something here
and it's pissing me off.

388
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:52,131
-They couldn't do both.
-What does that mean?

389
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,384
It was the office or the house.
I went to the suspect's house,

390
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,137
spent the day with JPR
and sent the Rio agents to his office.

391
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,139
How was I supposed to know?

392
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,391
Do you have any idea how much
evidence there was?

393
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,268
-Yes.
-[Verena] No, you don't.

394
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,688
We still have the Evoque.

395
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,901
It will take more.

396
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,197
[Verena] <i>I should have known there</i>
<i>was something wrong with Guilhome.</i>

397
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,575
<i>Every time there was trouble,</i>
<i>he'd take off for the bathroom.</i>

398
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,619
<i>It was like he had a bladder problem.</i>

399
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,371
[phone rings]

400
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,757
Any ideas?

401
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,261
How do I get that son of a bitch, JPR?

402
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,808
Did you take a look
at the office building security cameras?

403
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,019
[Verena] <i>But how could I complain?</i>

404
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,940
<i>Sometimes he was just</i>
<i>too good to be true.</i>

405
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,615
<i>Not only did he organize</i>
<i>Ibrahim's accounting in two days,</i>

406
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,535
<i>he also figured out JPR's case.</i>

407
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,121
<i>How could I have mistrusted</i>
<i>a guy like that?</i>

408
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,165
There.

409
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,168
See? His daughter and son-in-law.

410
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,672
What's JPR's game? What's he hiding?

411
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,137
A few tote bags and a couple of suitcases.

412
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:22,930
Atta boy!

413
