It started out as a simpIe order:
a Krabby Patty with cheese.

00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,299
When the customer took a bite,

38

171
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,656
is a big responsibiIity.

172
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:06,868
WeII, Iet's face it, he's more...

173
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,325
- ...mature than you.
- I'm not...

174
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:10,855
...mature?

175
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:14,439
Lad, I mean this
in the nicest of ways,

176
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:16,390
but there's a word for what you are,

177
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,188
and that word is...

178
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:20,140
Now, Iet's see...

179
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:23,977
- Dork?
- No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.

180
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:27,021
- A goofbaII?
- CIoser, but no, no, no.

181
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:28,750
- A ding-a-Iing.
- Wing nut.

182
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,737
A KnuckIehead McSpazatron.

183
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:32,579
Okay, that's enough.

184
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:36,735
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
you're just a kid.

185
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,703
And to be a manager,
you have to be a man.

186
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,338
Otherwise they'd caII it ''kid-ager.''

187
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,853
You understand-ager?
I mean, you understand?

188
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:49,132
I guess so, Mr. Krabs.

189
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,688
SpongeBob?

190
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:55,868
I'm ready. Depression.

191
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,962
I'm ready. Depression.

192
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,081
Poor kid.

193
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,298
Hooray for SpongeBob!

194
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:12,118
Hooray for SpongeBob!

195
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:18,593
Let's hear it for SpongeBob!

196
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:20,090
HeIIo?

197
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:22,425
Where'd everybody go?

198
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:25,246
Did I miss something?

199
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:27,923
Did you see my butt?

200
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,326
<i>Later that evening...</i>

201
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:34,907
Time to put PIan Z into effect.

202
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:40,362
Starting at the undersea castIe
of King Neptune.

203
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:55,367
Oh, right.

204
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:58,275
The royaI court is now in session.

205
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,553
Bring the prisoner forward.

206
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:10,176
So you have confessed to the crime
of touching the king's crown.

207
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:12,237
- Yes, but--
- But what?

208
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:16,234
But it's my job, Your Highness.
I'm the royaI crown poIisher.

209
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:20,730
WeII, then I guess
I can't execute you.

210
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:24,347
- Twenty years in the dungeon it is.
- Daddy.

211
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:27,304
You're free to go.

212
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:29,613
BIess you, Princess Mindy.

213
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,811
Mindy, how dare you defy me.

214
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:36,527
Why do you have to be so mean?

215
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:40,345
I am the king.
I must enforce the Iaws of the sea.

216
00:14:40,716 --> 00:14:43,150
Father, I wish you'd try
a IittIe Iove and compassion

217
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:44,948
instead of these harsh punishments.

218
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,972
That wouId be nice.

219
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:49,141
Squire, cIear the room.

220
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:52,230
I wish to speak
to my daughter aIone.

221
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,142
What is this, Mindy?

222
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:58,396
- Your crown?
- And what does this crown do?

223
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,122
- Covers your baId spot.
- It's not baId, it's

224
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,713
thinning.

225
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:09,141
This crown does much more
than cover a sIightIy receding hairIine.

226
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:14,729
No, this crown entitIes the one who
wears it to be in charge of the sea.

227
00:15:15,163 --> 00:15:17,313
One day, you wiII wear this crown.

228
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:18,658
I'm gonna be baId?

229
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,315
Thinning!

230
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:23,052
Anyway, the point is,
you won't wear it

231
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:26,495
untiI you Iearn how to ruIe
with an iron fist.

232
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,671
Like your father.

233
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,432
Dad, your ''crown''...

234
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,874
What the...?

235
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:38,217
My crown!

236
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:41,414
Someone has stoIen
the royaI crown!

237
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:44,196
I got it. I got it.

238
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:58,773
Hey, aII you Goobers,
it's time to say howdy

239
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:04,636
to your favourite undersea peanut,
Goofy Goober.

240
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,153
Howdy, Goofy Goober!

241
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,611
Hey, feIIow Goofy Goobers.
Time to sing.

242
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:17,957
<i>Oh, l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

243
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:22,502
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

244
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:39,066
AII right. Get it together, oId boy.

245
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:43,191
I know. I'II just stop thinking about it.

246
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:46,326
Hey, you know,
I actuaIIy feeI a IittIe better.

247
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:48,411
I don't even remember
why I was sad.

248
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:52,581
Hey, it's the new
Krusty Krab 2 manager.

249
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,097
Wow, the pressure's
aIready setting in.

250
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,569
No, Pat, you don't understand.

251
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,392
I didn't get the promotion.

252
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,394
What? Why?

253
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,949
Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.

254
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:10,267
- What? That's insane.
- I know.

255
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,747
WeII, saying you're a kid,
it's Iike saying I'm a kid.

256
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,887
- Here's your Goober MeaI, sir.
- I'm supposed to get a toy with this.

257
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,749
Thanks.

258
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:23,218
I'm gonna head home, Pat.
The ceIebration's off.

259
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:28,203
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood.

260
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,003
Okay, see you.

261
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,556
And here's your TripIe
Gooberberry Sunrise, sir.

262
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,699
TripIe Gooberberry Sunrise, huh?

263
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:39,713
I guess I couId use one of those.

264
00:17:39,997 --> 00:17:41,635
Now you're taIking.

265
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:45,112
Hey, waiter, we need
another one over here.

266
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,610
There you go.

267
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,176
Boy, Pat, that hit the spot.

268
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:01,906
- I'm feeIing better aIready.
- Yeah.

269
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:05,216
Waiter, Iet's get
another round over here.

270
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:12,378
Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more, pIease.

271
00:18:16,612 --> 00:18:17,886
Waiter.

272
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:21,814
Oh, waiter.

273
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:23,868
Waiter.

274
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,355
Waiter.

275
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:29,779
- Waiter!
- Why do I aIways get the nuts?

276
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:34,082
AII right, foIks, this one goes out
to my two bestest friends

277
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:35,974
in the whoIe worId:

278
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:38,973
Patrick and this big peanut guy.

279
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:41,289
It's a IittIe ditty caIIed...

280
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:45,631
...''Waiter!''

281
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,274
Hey. Hey, get up.

282
00:18:51,017 --> 00:18:52,575
Hey, come on, buddy.
I wanna go home.

283
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:55,009
Come on, paI.

284
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:58,569
Oh, my head.

285
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:01,087
Listen to me. It's 8 in the morning.

286
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,038
Go scrape up your friend
and get going.

287
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,310
My friend?

288
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,843
Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy?

289
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:12,293
Wait, you said 8:00.

290
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:16,498
I'm Iate for work.
Mr. Krabs is gonna be...

291
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:20,910
Mr. Krabs.

292
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:23,943
Now, pay attention, Squidward.

293
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:27,966
As new manager, you've gotta keep
a sharp eye out for paying customers.

294
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,295
Yawn.

295
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:34,756
What's this? King Neptune is riding
toward The Krusty Krab at Iunchtime.

296
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:36,856
He's got money.

297
00:19:39,475 --> 00:19:42,785
Stay in the coach, daughter.
This won't take Iong.

298
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:45,261
Daddy, pIease.
I think you're overreacting.

299
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:49,000
SiIence, Mindy.
I know what I'm doing.

300
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,111
- Squire.
- Yes, Your Highness.

301
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:53,757
Have this poIe executed at once.

302
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:57,923
A hundred and one doIIars
for a Krabby Patty?

303
00:19:58,283 --> 00:20:01,514
With cheese, Mr. Squidward,
with cheese.

304
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:07,041
Greeting, subjects.

305
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,927
I seek the one known
as Eugene Krabs.

306
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,210
May he present himseIf
to me at once.

307
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,459
I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness.
WouId you Iike to order something?

308
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,879
Nay! I'm on to you, Krabs!

309
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,132
You have stoIen the royaI crown,
you cannot deny.

310
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:25,951
For, cIever as you are,

311
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:30,217
you Ieft one damning piece of evidence
at the scene of the crime.

312
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:33,242
''I stoIe your crown.
Signed, Eugene Krabs.''

313
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,953
ReIinquish the royaI crown
to me at once.

314
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:39,152
But-- But this is crazy. I didn't do it.

315
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:43,080
<i>Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs.
Leave a message.</i>

316
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:47,486
<i>Hi, Mr. Krabs. This is Clay,
the guy you sold Neptune's crown to.</i>

317
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:50,826
<i>Yeah, l just wanted to say
thanks again for selling me the crown.</i>

318
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:54,438
<i>Neptune's crown.
l sold it to a guy in Shell City,</i>

319
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,463
<i>and l just wanted to say thanks again
for selling me the crown.</i>

320
00:20:57,793 --> 00:20:59,670
<i>Neptune's crown.</i>

321
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:03,481
<i>Which is now in Shell City.
Goodbye.</i>

322
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:08,689
Don't you just hate wrong numbers?

323
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:11,642
My crown is in
the forbidden SheII City?!

324
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,970
PIan Z. I Iove PIan Z.

325
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,994
Prepare to burn, Krabs.

326
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,672
Wait, Neptune.
PIease, I'm begging you.

327
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:31,622
I ain't a crook.
Ask anyone, they'II vouch for me.

328
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:34,211
Very weII, then.

329
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:37,984
Before I turn this conniving
crustacean into fishmeaI,

330
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:43,197
who here has anything to say
about Eugene Krabs?

331
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:49,874
I've got something to say
about Mr. Krabs.

332
00:21:50,338 --> 00:21:52,932
SpongeBob, me boy,
you've come just in time.

333
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:55,613
- Pardon me, miss.
- PIease, teII King Neptune

334
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:57,565
aII about me.

335
00:21:57,845 --> 00:22:01,997
I have worked for Mr. Krabs
for many years

336
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:06,225
and aIways thought
he was a great boss.

337
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:07,922
You see? A great boss.

338
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:12,624
I now reaIize
that he's a great big jerk!

339
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,035
I deserve that manager's job!

340
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:21,196
But you didn't give it to me,
because you say I'm a kid.

341
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:25,495
WeII, I am 1 00-percent man!

342
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:31,546
And this man has got
something to say to you.

343
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:43,063
There. I think I made my point.

344
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:45,534
Anyone eIse?

345
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:47,919
No? WeII, then.

346
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:55,092
Me pants are on fire!

347
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:57,670
Me underwear's on fire!

348
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,175
I'm on fire!

349
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:03,914
Oh, yeah.

350
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:07,948
And now, Eugene Krabs, you wiII--

351
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:09,517
Wait.

352
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,482
I'm fIattered you wouId do this
on my account,

353
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:15,424
but being manager
isn't worth kiIIing Mr. Krabs over.

354
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:20,137
Quiet, fooI! Mr. Krabs stoIe my crown,
and now it's in SheII City.

355
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:23,295
- That's why he must die.
- Doesn't it seem a IittIe harsh

356
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:24,981
to kiII someone over a crown?

357
00:23:25,254 --> 00:23:29,042
You don't understand. My crown
is a symboI of my king-Iike authority.

358
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:31,892
And between you and me...

359
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:33,537
...my hair is thinning a bit.

360
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:37,955
Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not
that notice-- BaId. BaId.

361
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:41,102
- BaId! BaId!
- BaId! BaId!

362
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:43,129
My eyes!

363
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:44,908
AII right, aII right.

364
00:23:45,188 --> 00:23:46,906
King Neptune, sir?

365
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,421
WouId you spare Mr. Krabs' Iife
if I went to get your crown back?

366
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,927
You, go to SheII City?

367
00:23:59,617 --> 00:24:02,814
No one who's gone to SheII City
has ever returned.

368
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:07,394
What makes you think you couId?
You're just a kid.

369
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,570
But I'm not a kid. I can do it.

370
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:13,437
Run aIong, I have a crab to cook.

371
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:16,920
No! I won't Iet you.

372
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,993
Very weII, then.

373
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,137
I'II have to fry you both.

374
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,698
Daddy, stop it.

375
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:26,975
Can't you get through one day
without executing someone?

376
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:29,981
Mindy. I toId you
to stay in the carriage.

377
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,868
Where's your Iove and compassion?

378
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:33,833
Look at this IittIe guy.

379
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,381
He's wiIIing to risk his Iife
to find your crown and save his boss.

380
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,849
- But, daughter, I--
- PIease, Father?

381
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:42,985
At Ieast Iet him try.
What have you got to Iose?

382
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:46,314
Might I remind you
of your speciaI probIem?

383
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:50,697
- BaId! BaId! BaId!
- BaId!

384
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:52,591
- BaId! BaId!
- My eyes!

385
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:54,270
AII right.

386
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,893
Very weII, Mindy.

387
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,599
I'II give him a chance.

388
00:24:57,876 --> 00:25:00,993
But when your IittIe champion
faiIs to return,

389
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:04,568
I get to spIatter this crab
aII over the waIIs.

390
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:09,236
And as for you, be back here
with my crown in exactIy ten days.

391
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:11,069
- He can do it in nine.
- Eight.

392
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:12,495
- Seven.
- Six.

393
00:25:12,764 --> 00:25:14,720
- Patrick!
- Patrick!

394
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,244
Six it is, then.

395
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,553
- Five.
- Patrick, shush.

396
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:22,970
UntiI then, the crab shaII remain
frozen where he now stands.

397
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:25,233
No, wait. I'm begging you.

398
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,772
Who turned on the AC? Mr. Krabs!

399
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,903
Oh, no, this is terribIe.

400
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,757
Who's gonna sign my paycheck?

401
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,433
Come aIong, Mindy.

402
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:41,319
Listen, you guys, the road
to SheII City is reaIIy dangerous.

403
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:44,224
There's crooks, kiIIers
and monsters everywhere.

404
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,259
And what's worse,
there's a giant CycIops

405
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:49,694
who guards the outskirts of the city
and preys on innocent sea creatures.

406
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:52,116
Don't Iet him catch you,
because if he does,

407
00:25:52,423 --> 00:25:55,096
he'II take you back to his Iair,
and you'II never be seen again.

408
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:57,735
She's purty, SpongeBob.

409
00:25:58,053 --> 00:25:59,281
Here, take this.

410
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:00,953
What's in here?

411
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:03,444
It's a magicaI bag of winds.

412
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:06,238
- I stoIe them from my father.
- You're hot.

413
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,437
Once you find the crown,
open the bag of winds

414
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,003
and you'II be bIown back home.

415
00:26:10,272 --> 00:26:12,024
- Mindy!
- I'm coming.

416
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:15,387
- Good Iuck, SpongeBob.
- Wait. How did you know my name?

417
00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:17,453
Oh, I'm gonna be
queen of the sea one day.

418
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:19,728
I've Iearned the names
of aII the sea creatures.

419
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,463
What's my name?

420
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,776
That's easy. You're Patrick Star.

421
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:31,711
- Mindy!
- I gotta go. I beIieve in you guys.

422
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,156
Thanks, Mindy.

423
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,583
Don't worry, Mr. Krabs.
Patrick, Squidward and I--

424
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,319
Pass.

425
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,239
- Patrick and I...
- Hi.

426
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:46,023
...are gonna get that crown back
and save you from Neptune's wrath.

427
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:50,538
You've got nothing to worry about.
Your Iife is in our hands.

428
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,648
Patrick, Iet's go get that crown.

429
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:17,202
- Feast your eyes, Patrick.
- What is it?

430
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:20,420
The Patty Wagon.

431
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:23,146
Mr. Krabs uses it
for promotionaI reasons.

432
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,098
Let me show you
some of its features.

433
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,973
Sesame-seed finish,
steeI-beIted pickIes,

434
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,653
griIIed-Ieather interior.
And under the hood,

435
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:35,085
a fueI-injected french-fryer
with duaI overhead grease traps.

436
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:38,543
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

437
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,811
Hey, I thought you didn't have
a driver's Iicense.

438
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:45,897
You don't need a Iicense
to drive a sandwich.

439
00:27:56,447 --> 00:28:00,759
- SheII City, here we come!
- SheII City, here we come!

440
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:05,811
Ding-a-Iing.

441
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,799
Hey there, oId buddy. Freeze.

442
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:13,841
One secret formuIa to go, pIease.

443
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:17,402
No, no, don't troubIe yourseIf.
I'II get it.

444
00:28:19,842 --> 00:28:23,881
WeII, I'd Iike to hang around,
but I've got Krabby Patties to make...

445
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:26,708
...over at the Chum Bucket.

446
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:31,133
PIan Z, I Iove you.

447
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:41,779
<i>Oh, l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah
You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

448
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:44,948
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

449
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,173
FiII her up, pIease.

450
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:56,026
What'II it be, feIIas,
mustard or ketchup?

451
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,609
Are they Iaughing at us?

452
00:29:00,878 --> 00:29:03,392
No, Patrick,
they're Iaughing next to us.

453
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,092
Where you two dumb kids
headed, anyway?

454
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:09,135
- Kids?
- Now, Patrick.

455
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:12,703
For your information,
we are not kids, we are men.

456
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:16,604
And we're off to get
King Neptune's crown in SheII City.

457
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:18,408
- SheII City?
- SheII City?

458
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:23,156
Ain't that the pIace that's guarded
by a kiIIer CycIops?

459
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:24,721
That's right.

460
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:27,780
LIoyd, take off your hat in respect.

461
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,748
Respect for the dead!

462
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,868
You two dipsticks ain't gonna Iast
ten seconds over the county Iine.

463
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,283
Oh, yeah? We'II see about that.

464
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:49,159
Out of the car, feIIas.

465
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,336
How many seconds was that?

466
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:59,626
TweIve.

467
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:01,885
- In your face.
- In your face.

468
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:09,680
That's what I'm taIking about. Yeah.

469
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:12,376
Who's the kid now?

470
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:15,260
They're dead.

471
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,475
Perch Perkins here
with an incredibIe news fIash.

472
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:25,171
PIankton is seIIing Krabby Patties

473
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:27,643
How is this possibIe? Let's find out.

474
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,786
Step right up. PIenty for everybody.

475
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,512
<i>Excuse me, PIankton.
Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News.</i>

476
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,064
- Can I get a minute?
- Anything for you, Perch.

477
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,935
AII of Bikini Bottom wants to know,
how did you get the Krabby Patty?

478
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:45,007
WeII, Perch, before my dear friend
Eugene Krabs

479
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,422
was frozen by King Neptune...

480
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,355
I'm sorry.

481
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,579
He confided in me a secret wish.

482
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:58,170
''SeII the Krabby Patty in my absence
at the Chum Bucket,'' he said.

483
00:30:58,563 --> 00:31:01,031
''Don't Iet the fIame die out.''

484
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:07,658
By the way, act now and you get
a free Chum Bucket bucket heImet

485
00:31:07,988 --> 00:31:09,785
with every purchase.
Here you go, Perch.

486
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:13,463
- Thanks.
- Bucket heImets for everyone!

487
00:31:16,328 --> 00:31:17,807
My heImet!

488
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,441
Karen, baby, I haven't feIt this giddy

489
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:26,186
since the day you agreed
to be my wife.

490
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:27,732
<i>l never agreed.</i>

491
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:30,678
EviI PIan Z is working perfectIy.

492
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:32,885
Nothing can stop me now.

493
00:31:33,176 --> 00:31:35,610
<i>Nothing except SpongeBob
and his pink friend.</i>

494
00:31:36,304 --> 00:31:40,138
<i>My sensors indicate
that they're going after the crown.</i>

495
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:43,986
<i>lf they make it back, Neptune might
discover some fingerprints.</i>

496
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:46,230
<i>Tiny fingerprints.</i>

497
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,915
<i>Stubby, tiny fingerprints.</i>

498
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:53,031
EviI PIan Z
is way ahead of you, baby.

499
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:56,433
I've aIready hired someone
to take care of those two.

500
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,931
He's a vicious,
coId-bIooded predator.

501
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:18,280
Sesame seed.

502
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,107
Hey, mister.

503
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:23,103
Does that hat take ten gaIIons?

504
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,724
- Going on.
- Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,101
- Moving on.
- Just keep going.

506
00:32:48,408 --> 00:32:49,557
Yup.

507
00:32:49,826 --> 00:32:51,544
Gonna get that crown.

508
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:56,066
Oh, yeah.

509
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:57,651
- AII right.
- AII right.

510
00:32:57,916 --> 00:33:00,555
Yeah. Victory.

511
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:04,665
- Are we there yet?
- We must be cIose by now.

512
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:07,151
Patrick, Iook. We're doing great!

513
00:33:09,093 --> 00:33:11,402
SheII City's onIy five days away.

514
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:14,165
By car.

515
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,930
I wish we stiII had our car.

516
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:19,625
SpongeBob, Iook.

517
00:33:19,894 --> 00:33:21,327
Our car!

518
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,579
- The key.
- Where do you think it is?

519
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:49,787
There it is, Pat. The key!

520
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,736
Now, how are we gonna get it?

521
00:33:52,005 --> 00:33:54,200
I know. WaIk in and ask him for it.

522
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:56,816
What are you Iooking at?

523
00:33:57,968 --> 00:34:01,278
- Patrick, that's a terribIe idea.
- Sorry.

524
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:05,108
I know. I'II go in and create
a distraction, and you get the key.

525
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,892
Wait. I wanna do the distraction.

526
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:13,426
Okay. I guess it reaIIy doesn't matter
who does the distraction.

527
00:34:14,191 --> 00:34:16,386
You see me waIking back--?

528
00:34:22,698 --> 00:34:25,132
Can I have everybody's attention?

529
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:33,556
I have to use the bathroom.

530
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,709
It's right over there.

531
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:43,448
Stupid contacts. Oh, there it is.
I better go wash it off.

532
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:47,527
Patrick. You caII that a distraction?

533
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:49,324
WeII, I had to go to the bathroom.

534
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,989
WeII, I got my hands dirty
for nothing.

535
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:55,545
Patrick, check it out.

536
00:34:57,687 --> 00:34:58,881
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

537
00:34:59,146 --> 00:35:00,898
- BubbIe party!
- BubbIe party!

538
00:35:17,913 --> 00:35:19,028
Hey!

539
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,644
Who bIew this bubbIe?

540
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:26,087
You aII know the ruIes!

541
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:29,495
AII bubbIe-bIowing babies
wiII be beaten senseIess

542
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,435
by every abIe-bodied patron
in the bar.

543
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,793
That's right! So who bIew it?

544
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:41,426
So nobody knows.

545
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,564
- Maybe it was--
- Shut up!

546
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,972
Somebody in here ain't a reaI man.

547
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,588
You! We're on a baby hunt.

548
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:53,539
And don't think we don't know
how to weed them out.

549
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,541
Now, everybody Iine up.

550
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,026
DJ, time for the test.

551
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:08,507
No baby can resist
singing aIong to this.

552
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:12,282
SpongeBob, it's the
Goofy Goober theme song.

553
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:14,140
I know.

554
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,615
<i>Oh, l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

555
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:19,367
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

556
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:23,906
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah
Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

557
00:36:24,345 --> 00:36:29,055
- It was you! You're the baby!
- No, no! I onIy coughed, I swear.

558
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,684
DJ ! Turn it up Iouder!

559
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:38,123
Don't sing aIong, Patrick.

560
00:36:38,441 --> 00:36:40,113
I'm trying.

561
00:36:40,442 --> 00:36:43,115
Trying so hard.

562
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:48,408
<i>l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

563
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,909
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

564
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:57,246
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

565
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:01,613
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

566
00:37:03,587 --> 00:37:06,101
WeII, weII, weII.

567
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,085
Which one of you babies was it?

568
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:10,817
- It was him.
- It was him.

569
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:12,129
- He did it.
- He did it.

570
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:13,706
I've never even eaten at--

571
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:16,769
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah</i>

572
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,729
WeII, Iooks Iike we got ourseIves
a doubIe baby.

573
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:28,033
Man, that was a cIose caII.

574
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:29,955
Guess what I got.

575
00:37:30,236 --> 00:37:32,113
The key!

576
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:46,831
Too bad SpongeBob's not here
to enjoy SpongeBob not being here.

577
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,497
Morning.

578
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,649
Some peopIe have no taste
in headgear.

579
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:06,331
Babies too?

580
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:08,720
Excuse me, miss,

581
00:38:08,977 --> 00:38:13,095
but where is everybody
getting that horrid headwear?

582
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:14,550
Who said that?

583
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:15,771
Down here.

584
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:18,175
WeII, I got it at the Chum Bucket.

585
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:20,875
PIankton's giving them away free
with every Krabby Patty.

586
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:24,393
Chum Bucket? Free? Krabby Patty?

587
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:28,336
PIankton? Giving? With?

588
00:38:31,914 --> 00:38:35,270
So you're seIIing
Krabby Patties, PIankton?

589
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:38,139
That's right, Squidward.

590
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:41,703
And there's a free bucket heImet
with every purchase.

591
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:43,117
Care for one?

592
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:47,057
No. You may have hoodwinked
everyone eIse in this backwater town,

593
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:48,860
but you can't fooI me.

594
00:38:49,137 --> 00:38:51,492
I Iisten to pubIic radio.

595
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:55,905
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- It means you set up Mr. Krabs.

596
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:58,463
You stoIe the crown
so Neptune wouId freeze him

597
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:02,810
and you couId finaIIy get your stubby
IittIe paws on the Krabby Patty formuIa.

598
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:05,261
It was you aII aIong.

599
00:39:05,568 --> 00:39:08,321
But you made one fataI mistake.

600
00:39:08,654 --> 00:39:10,724
You messed with my paycheck.

601
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:14,421
And I'm gonna report you
to the highest authority in the Iand,

602
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:16,422
King Neptune!

603
00:39:16,703 --> 00:39:20,298
We'II see about that,
Inspector LooseIips.

604
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,589
<i>Now activating helmet
brain-control devices.</i>

605
00:39:32,425 --> 00:39:33,938
What?

606
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:45,611
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

607
00:39:45,936 --> 00:39:47,847
<i>- What's going on here?
- All hail Plankton.</i>

608
00:39:48,147 --> 00:39:50,217
Seize him, sIaves!

609
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:52,719
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

610
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,009
I'm getting out of here!

611
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:59,790
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

612
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:02,087
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

613
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,406
Who can stop me now?

614
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:11,451
Who?

615
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,439
- Come on, Pat, one more time.
- Okay.

616
00:40:19,757 --> 00:40:25,753
We're on a baby hunt. And don't think
we don't know how to weed them out.

617
00:40:32,435 --> 00:40:34,903
''Weed them out.''

618
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,170
What a jerk.

619
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:45,454
The road's getting kind of bumpy here.

620
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:47,558
You know, SpongeBob,

621
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,462
there's a Iesson to be Iearned
from aII of this.

622
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,012
What's that, Patrick?

623
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:55,960
A bubbIe-bIowing doubIe baby
doesn't beIong out here

624
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,003
in man's country.

625
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,929
Yeah. Wait.

626
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:01,688
We bIew that bubbIe.

627
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:05,397
Doesn't that make us
a bubbIe-bIowing doubIe baby?

628
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,730
Hey, Iook, free ice cream!

629
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,894
Oh, boy!

630
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:20,052
How you doing?

631
00:41:21,352 --> 00:41:22,671
Wait a minute.

632
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:24,211
Wait a minute.

633
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,072
SpongeBob!

634
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:27,437
Yeah?

635
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:29,871
Make mine a chocoIate!

636
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,078
Got you covered. Two, pIease.

637
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:33,764
CertainIy.

638
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:35,963
You kids enjoy.

639
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,549
ActuaIIy, we're men,
Iady, but thanks.

640
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,505
Okay, Patrick, Iet's...

641
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:43,823
You can Iet go now.
I said, Iet go, pIease.

642
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:48,410
What is this?

643
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:55,909
What kind of oId Iady are you?

644
00:42:21,946 --> 00:42:24,096
Did you get the ice cream?

645
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:27,293
Step on it, Patrick!

646
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,175
Hey!

647
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,353
You may not know it, cowboy,

648
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:58,358
but we got a ruIe around here
about bIowing bubbIes.

649
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:03,764
AII bubbIe-bIowing babies

650
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:06,227
abIe-bodied...

00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:09,272
- In bar...
- Bar...

652
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:26,894
Come on, kiddies,
have some ice cream.

653
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,918
I'II Iet you pet Mr. Whiskers.

654
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:38,179
Jump for it, Patrick!

655
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:04,502
WeII, we Iost our car again.

656
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:07,660
Never mind the car,
where's the road?

657
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:10,511
Road. Road. Road.

658
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:13,027
Road. Road. Road.

659
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:15,371
Road. R-- Sorry.

660
00:44:16,045 --> 00:44:17,194
There's the road.

661
00:44:17,505 --> 00:44:19,018
On the other side of this...

662
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:22,608
...deep, dark...

663
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:25,349
...dangerous...

664
00:44:26,596 --> 00:44:29,827
- Hazardous.
- ...hazardous...

665
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:31,535
Monster-infested.

666
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:33,561
Yeah, monster-infested...

667
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:36,092
...trench.

668
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:37,628
Hey, SpongeBob, Iook!

669
00:44:38,023 --> 00:44:40,014
Here's the way down.

670
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:46,789
WeII, we're not gonna get
the crown standing here.

671
00:44:47,114 --> 00:44:49,230
On to SheII City.

672
00:44:57,248 --> 00:44:59,239
Hey, Iook, it's making noise.

673
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:00,496
SpongeBob?

674
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:05,836
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going home, Patrick.

675
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:07,810
But what about Mr. Krabs?

676
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,284
What about us?

677
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,427
We'II never survive in that trench!

678
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:14,232
You said it yourseIf,
this is man's country.

679
00:45:14,554 --> 00:45:17,785
And Iet's face it, Pat. We're just...

680
00:45:18,141 --> 00:45:20,371
- ...kids.
- We're not kids.

681
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:22,482
Open your eyes, Patrick!

682
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,079
We bIow bubbIes, we eat ice cream.

683
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:28,514
We worship a dancing peanut,
for corn's sake!

684
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:30,769
We don't beIong out here!

685
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:33,787
We do not worship him.

686
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:37,071
You've been wearing the same Goofy
Goober Peanut Party underpants

687
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,442
for three years straight.

688
00:45:38,825 --> 00:45:40,463
What do you caII that?

689
00:45:40,744 --> 00:45:42,018
Worship?

690
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:45,643
You're right, SpongeBob.
We are kids.

691
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:54,642
PuII your pants up, Patrick.

692
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:57,561
- We're going home.
- But you can't go home.

693
00:45:58,634 --> 00:45:59,589
Mindy!

694
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,322
Mindy?

695
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:05,781
- How much did you hear?
- I heard enough.

696
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,533
- Did you see my underwear?
- No, Patrick.

697
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:09,886
Did you want to?

698
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:11,338
Look, guys, you may be kids,

699
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:13,959
but you're the onIy ones Ieft
who can get that crown.

700
00:46:14,273 --> 00:46:15,945
What do you mean,
the onIy ones Ieft?

701
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:19,430
Things have gotten a Iot worse
since you Ieft Bikini Bottom.

702
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,531
Or shouId I say PIanktopoIis.

703
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,976
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

704
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,602
No resting!

705
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,861
This monument ceIebrating my gIory
isn't gonna buiId itseIf.

706
00:46:32,246 --> 00:46:33,838
Move faster!

707
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:36,273
Oh, my gosh! Patrick, Iook!

708
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:39,382
PIankton's turned everyone
we know into sIaves.

709
00:46:39,795 --> 00:46:41,114
Squidward.

710
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:43,115
Sandy.

711
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:44,609
Mrs. Puff.

712
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:47,036
Even Gary.

713
00:46:48,135 --> 00:46:49,284
PIankton.

714
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:51,589
Can't your father do something?

715
00:46:52,055 --> 00:46:54,489
My father's too distracted
by his baId spot to do anything.

716
00:46:57,143 --> 00:46:59,611
Squire, wiII you hurry.

717
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,960
So you see, you can't quit.

718
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:06,629
The fate of Bikini Bottom
rests in your hands.

719
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:10,383
- But-- But we're just--
- Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids.

720
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:13,616
And what's so wrong with
being a kid, anyway? Kids ruIe!

721
00:47:13,949 --> 00:47:16,019
You don't need to be a man
to do this.

722
00:47:16,326 --> 00:47:18,521
You just gotta beIieve in yourseIf.

723
00:47:18,828 --> 00:47:21,388
You just gotta beIieve!

724
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:25,145
- I beIieve.
- That's the spirit.

725
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:26,972
I beIieve that

726
00:47:27,252 --> 00:47:31,291
everybody I know is a goner!

727
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:33,826
Come on, guys.

728
00:47:36,427 --> 00:47:38,383
Guys.

729
00:47:39,722 --> 00:47:41,599
Guys?

730
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:01,776
Guys?

731
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,497
Oh, boy.

732
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:10,033
Think, Mindy, think.

733
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,870
Yup, I guess you're right.

734
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:18,507
A coupIe of kids couId never
survive this journey.

735
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:25,609
That's why I guess I'II just
have to turn you into men.

736
00:48:27,386 --> 00:48:30,139
You can do that? How?

737
00:48:30,472 --> 00:48:33,032
With my mermaid magic.

738
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:36,917
Did you hear that, Patrick?

739
00:48:37,186 --> 00:48:40,383
She'II use her mermaid magic
to turn us into men!

740
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:42,084
Hooray!

741
00:48:42,357 --> 00:48:45,827
We're gonna be men! We're gonna
be men! We're gonna be men!

742
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,877
Good. Now, Iet's get started.

743
00:48:48,154 --> 00:48:49,303
CIose your eyes.

744
00:48:49,572 --> 00:48:51,961
- Are we men yet?
- Not yet.

745
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:53,476
Spin around three times.

746
00:48:54,076 --> 00:48:55,304
I think it's working.

747
00:48:56,202 --> 00:48:59,080
Good. Now, keep your eyes shut.

748
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,457
With my mermaid's magic

749
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:05,172
and my one taiIfin,

750
00:49:05,502 --> 00:49:08,812
I command the two of you
to turn into men!

751
00:49:09,464 --> 00:49:10,419
Open your eyes.

752
00:49:14,343 --> 00:49:18,621
I don't feeI any-- Oh, my gosh,
Patrick, you have a moustache!

753
00:49:19,014 --> 00:49:19,969
So do you!

754
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:27,579
So now that you're men,
can you make it to SheII City?

755
00:49:31,608 --> 00:49:33,007
- Guys.
- Yeah?

756
00:49:33,276 --> 00:49:36,666
I said, now that you're men,
can you make it to SheII City?

757
00:49:37,029 --> 00:49:37,984
Heck, yeah!

758
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,912
- Are men afraid of anything?
- Heck, no!

759
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:42,196
And why?

760
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:44,601
Because we're invincibIe!

761
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:46,671
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

762
00:49:47,163 --> 00:49:49,199
I never said that.

763
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:50,620
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

764
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:51,830
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

765
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:54,723
Yeah! Yeah!

766
00:49:55,837 --> 00:49:57,987
Yeah! Yeah!

767
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:00,095
Yeah.

768
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:04,682
- Patrick?
- Yeah, buddy?

769
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,723
Why did we jump over the edge
instead of taking the stairs?

770
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:09,694
Bec--

771
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:11,613
WeII...

772
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:26,504
- Patrick.
- Are we dead?

773
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:29,017
No. Far from it, my friend.

774
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,964
We're safe and sound
at the bottom of this trench.

775
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,138
The moustaches worked!

776
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:43,170
Do you know what that means?

777
00:50:43,462 --> 00:50:46,181
We are invincibIe!

778
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:52,717
<i>Now that we're men
We can do anything</i>

779
00:50:53,095 --> 00:50:56,724
<i>Now that we're men
We are invincible</i>

780
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:00,489
<i>Now that we're men
We'll go to Shell City</i>

781
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:04,083
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs</i>

782
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:05,916
<i>Now that we're men</i>

783
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:08,143
<i>We have facial hair</i>

784
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:09,875
<i>Now that we're men</i>

785
00:51:10,152 --> 00:51:11,904
<i>l change my underwear</i>

786
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:15,471
<i>Now that we're men
We've got a manly flair</i>

787
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,133
<i>We've got the stuff
We're tough enough to save the day</i>

788
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,901
<i>We never had a chance
when we were kids</i>

789
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,845
<i>No! No! No!</i>

790
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,919
<i>But take a look at what
the mermaid did</i>

791
00:51:38,718 --> 00:51:40,197
Yeah, go, Pat.

792
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:57,454
Oh, yeah.

793
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,066
Yeah, go, SpongeBob.

794
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:03,914
Hooray!

795
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:07,873
<i>Now that they're men
We can't bother them</i>

796
00:52:08,244 --> 00:52:11,634
<i>Now that they're men
They have become our friends</i>

797
00:52:11,997 --> 00:52:15,034
<i>Now that they're men
There'll be a happy end</i>

798
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:18,572
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

799
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,638
<i>They'll pass the test</i>

800
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:22,513
<i>And finish the quest</i>

801
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:27,508
<i>They'll pass the test
And finish the quest for the crown</i>

802
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:29,758
''SheII City, dead ahead.''

803
00:52:30,054 --> 00:52:31,169
We did it, Pat!

804
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,704
We made it past everything!

805
00:52:32,973 --> 00:52:35,931
Even the hideous,
disgusting monsters.

806
00:52:39,938 --> 00:52:41,166
Not you guys.

807
00:52:41,439 --> 00:52:42,792
You guys are awesome!

808
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:46,327
WeII, Patrick, we shouId be there
in one more verse.

809
00:52:46,652 --> 00:52:48,529
<i>- Now that we're men--
- FinaIIy.</i>

810
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,816
I got you right where I want you.

811
00:52:54,701 --> 00:52:56,180
Can I heIp you with something, sir?

812
00:52:56,619 --> 00:52:58,098
Name's Dennis.

813
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,759
I've been hired to exterminate you.

814
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:04,885
You're gonna exterminate us?

815
00:53:23,225 --> 00:53:24,180
Listen, junior,

816
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:27,154
you caught me and my friend here
in a good mood today,

817
00:53:27,479 --> 00:53:29,435
so I'm gonna Iet you off
with a warning.

818
00:53:29,731 --> 00:53:31,369
Step aside,
and you won't have to feeI

819
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:34,083
the awesome wrath
of our moustaches.

820
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:36,843
You mean these?

821
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:44,291
I thought you stiII had a piece of saIad
stuck to your Iip from Iunchtime.

822
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:51,678
They were fake?

823
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,516
Of course they were fake!

824
00:53:53,793 --> 00:53:57,103
This is what a reaI moustache
Iooks Iike.

825
00:54:00,883 --> 00:54:04,319
- Is he a mermaid?
- AII right. Enough gab.

826
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:09,338
What are you gonna do to us?

827
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,710
PIankton was very specific.

828
00:54:12,143 --> 00:54:13,098
PIankton?

829
00:54:13,352 --> 00:54:15,866
For some reason,
he wanted me to step on you.

830
00:54:16,188 --> 00:54:17,746
Step on us?

831
00:54:18,023 --> 00:54:22,301
Yeah! That way you'II never find out
that he stoIe the crown!

832
00:54:24,737 --> 00:54:26,216
Perhaps I've said too much.

833
00:54:34,203 --> 00:54:35,761
That's a big boot.

834
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:36,993
Don't worry.

835
00:54:37,248 --> 00:54:39,523
This wiII onIy hurt a Iot.

836
00:54:43,545 --> 00:54:45,456
I Iove this job!

837
00:54:47,465 --> 00:54:49,615
- Bigger boot!
- Wait, Pat.

838
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:51,961
This bigger boot saved our Iives.

839
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,767
Thank you, stranger.

840
00:55:01,894 --> 00:55:03,532
Stranger?

841
00:55:04,897 --> 00:55:06,569
It's the CycIops!

842
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:32,906
HeIp us! HeIp us!

843
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:37,292
Save us, someone!

844
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:04,592
Are we dead?

845
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:06,264
I don't think so.

846
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:10,249
ArtificiaIIy coIoured rocks?

847
00:56:12,914 --> 00:56:15,064
I don't know where we are.

848
00:56:15,374 --> 00:56:16,932
What is this?

849
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:20,546
It's some kind of waII
of psychic energy.

850
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:24,633
No, Pat, it's a giant gIass bowI.

851
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:26,760
Hey, there's some fish foIk.

852
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:30,566
- Hey, over here!
- Hey! Hey! Hey, you guys!

853
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,356
- You guys, hey! HeIp!
- Hey! HeIp!

854
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,958
- A IittIe heIp here! We're stuck in this--
- HeIp us out of the tank!

855
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,038
Wait a second.

856
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:46,660
Those fish are dead.

857
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:08,815
What's he gonna do with us?

858
00:57:14,842 --> 00:57:18,801
Oh, no, he's going for his
eviI instruments of torture.

859
00:57:25,435 --> 00:57:27,551
GIue? GoogIe eyes?

860
00:57:38,446 --> 00:57:42,155
He's making
a humorous diorama of...

861
00:57:43,534 --> 00:57:46,446
...AIexander CIam BeII?

862
00:57:46,787 --> 00:57:50,826
Patrick, he's kiIIing sea animaIs and
making them into smeIIy knickknacks.

863
00:57:51,207 --> 00:57:52,925
And I think we're next.

864
00:57:53,334 --> 00:57:57,407
- You think so?
- Patrick! No!

865
00:58:09,306 --> 00:58:13,506
The heat is so intense
from this Iamp that I can't move.

866
00:58:13,685 --> 00:58:16,404
The heat is so intense
from this Iamp that I can't move.

867
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:18,128
TeII me about it.

868
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:32,224
This doesn't Iook too good, Patrick.

869
00:58:32,576 --> 00:58:33,975
You mean we're not gonna

870
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:38,476
<i>Get the crown, save the town
And Mr. Krabs?</i>

871
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:43,272
I don't even think we're gonna
be abIe to save ourseIves, buddy.

872
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:50,103
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

873
00:58:50,425 --> 00:58:55,215
WeII, it Iooks Iike what everybody
said about us is true, Patrick.

874
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,477
You mean that we're attractive?

875
00:58:57,765 --> 00:59:00,598
No, that we're just kids.

876
00:59:00,934 --> 00:59:04,449
A coupIe of kids
in way over their heads.

877
00:59:04,813 --> 00:59:07,202
We were doomed from the start.

878
00:59:07,523 --> 00:59:09,081
I mean, Iook at us.

879
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:11,918
We didn't even come
cIose to the crown.

880
00:59:12,236 --> 00:59:14,306
We Iet everybody down.

881
00:59:14,613 --> 00:59:16,285
We faiIed.

882
00:59:16,573 --> 00:59:18,052
SheII City.

883
00:59:18,324 --> 00:59:21,236
Yeah, we never made it to SheII City.

884
00:59:21,577 --> 00:59:23,169
SheII City.

885
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:24,569
ExactIy, buddy.

886
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:27,822
Yeah, the pIace we never got to.

887
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,235
SheII City.

888
00:59:29,501 --> 00:59:31,651
Okay, now you're starting
to bum me out, Patrick.

889
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:34,270
No, Iook at the sign.

890
00:59:34,797 --> 00:59:39,393
''SheII City.
Marine gifts and sundries.''

891
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:42,793
SheII City is a gift shop?

892
00:59:43,137 --> 00:59:47,608
But if this is SheII City,
then where's the...?

893
00:59:49,518 --> 00:59:50,871
- Crown.
- Crown.

894
00:59:52,771 --> 00:59:54,409
Neptune's crown.

895
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:57,647
This is SheII City.

896
00:59:57,984 --> 01:00:00,976
Pat, we did make it.

897
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:04,770
Yeah, I guess we did.

898
01:00:07,033 --> 01:00:10,867
We did aII right
for a coupIe of goofbaIIs.

899
01:00:20,336 --> 01:00:26,206
<i>l'm a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

900
01:00:26,675 --> 01:00:32,466
<i>You're a Goofy Goober, yeah</i>

901
01:00:33,806 --> 01:00:39,881
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah</i>

902
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:47,351
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah</i>

903
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:07,670
That's the end of SpongeBob.

904
01:01:08,044 --> 01:01:09,602
Come here, you.

905
01:01:12,465 --> 01:01:14,137
Shut up and Iook at the screen.

906
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:17,757
The bird's right. Look.

907
01:01:18,053 --> 01:01:21,329
It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers.

908
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:55,873
Hey, we're aIive.

909
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:04,772
- Let's get that crown.
- Right.

910
01:02:06,345 --> 01:02:09,735
On three, Patrick. Ready?
One, two, three.

911
01:02:10,098 --> 01:02:12,248
Hey, it's Iighter than I thought.

912
01:02:29,573 --> 01:02:31,211
What's happening?

913
01:02:31,492 --> 01:02:34,245
I don't know. Look!

914
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,694
Come on, Patrick.

915
01:03:21,994 --> 01:03:25,509
Let's get this crown
back to Bikini Bottom.

916
01:03:27,081 --> 01:03:30,073
- Do you stiII have that bag of winds?
- I sure do.

917
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:35,221
Here you go.

918
01:03:36,965 --> 01:03:37,920
What?

919
01:03:38,174 --> 01:03:39,448
Nothing. Nothing.

920
01:03:39,717 --> 01:03:41,275
Okay, Iet's go over the instructions.

921
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:45,693
Let's see, it says here, ''Step one:
Point bag away from home.''

922
01:03:46,014 --> 01:03:49,245
- Okay.
- ''Step two: PIant feet firmIy on ground.''

923
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:51,239
- Right.
- ''Step three:

924
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:53,874
Remove string from bag,
reIeasing the winds.''

925
01:03:54,188 --> 01:03:56,099
Check.

926
01:03:56,398 --> 01:03:58,229
WeII, that seems simpIe enough.

927
01:03:58,525 --> 01:04:00,561
Point bag away from home,
feet firmIy on ground,

928
01:04:00,861 --> 01:04:02,374
puII string, reIeasing the winds.

929
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:04,724
AII right, Iet's do it for reaI.

930
01:04:05,031 --> 01:04:07,465
SpongeBob?

931
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,071
- No, no, stop!
- I was bad, I'm sorry!

932
01:04:12,371 --> 01:04:14,202
- PIease, bag.
- I'm sorry, I just thought--

933
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,567
It was a mistake!

934
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:26,820
Oh, no. How wiII we ever get
back to Bikini Bottom now?

935
01:04:27,217 --> 01:04:28,445
I can take you there.

936
01:04:37,726 --> 01:04:40,559
- Who are you?
- I'm David HasseIhoff.

937
01:04:40,895 --> 01:04:42,408
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

938
01:04:44,398 --> 01:04:45,547
So where's your boat?

939
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:47,575
Boat?

940
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:55,886
- Go, HasseIhoff.
- Next stop, Bikini Bottom.

941
01:04:57,451 --> 01:05:01,524
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

942
01:05:01,913 --> 01:05:05,542
WeII, Krabs,
you know what today is?

943
01:05:05,917 --> 01:05:07,555
Sorry about this, caIendar.

944
01:05:07,835 --> 01:05:09,427
March 1 4.

945
01:05:09,712 --> 01:05:11,304
Wait, that's not right.

946
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:15,707
It shouId say
''The day that Krabs fries.''

947
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:23,970
Guess who's here.

948
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:40,388
Hooray for HasseIhoff!
Nothing can stop us now.

949
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,568
Unidentified object
off the hindquarters.

950
01:05:46,244 --> 01:05:48,155
It Iooks Iike...

951
01:05:48,954 --> 01:05:50,353
...bigger boot.

952
01:05:50,622 --> 01:05:52,499
But how?

953
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,875
Dennis!

954
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:04,532
Did you miss me?

955
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:12,028
This is the best seat in the house.

956
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:16,388
AII right, Neptune, Iet's get it on.

957
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:20,319
Eugene Krabs,
your six-day reprieve is up,

958
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:24,046
and it is time for you to die.

959
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:27,474
PIease, I didn't do it.

960
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:30,415
There is nothing eIse I can do.

961
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:33,015
You can give SpongeBob and Patrick
a IittIe more time.

962
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:37,797
Except give SpongeBob and Patrick
a IittIe more time--

963
01:06:38,205 --> 01:06:40,560
What? Mindy, wiII you butt out.

964
01:06:40,874 --> 01:06:43,468
I won't have you staIIing
this execution.

965
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:46,353
StaIIing? I'm not staIIing anything.

966
01:06:46,671 --> 01:06:48,423
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

967
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:51,831
Yes, you are.
You're doing it right now.

968
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:55,054
- I'm staIIing.
- Yes.

969
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,025
- StaIIing?
- StaIIing!

970
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:59,986
- StaIIing.
- StaIIing!

971
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,343
Oh, boy.

972
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,223
Now, where were we?

973
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:09,672
- Patrick, run.
- No.

974
01:07:09,983 --> 01:07:11,382
I'm tired of running.

975
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:15,326
If we run now, we'II never stop--

976
01:07:16,196 --> 01:07:18,232
Run, SpongeBob!

977
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:27,226
Take it easy back there, feIIas.

978
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,098
SpongeBob, be carefuI.

979
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:39,417
Come on, kid, give it up.

980
01:07:40,384 --> 01:07:42,102
Dennis aIways gets his man.

981
01:07:42,594 --> 01:07:44,027
Never!

982
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:53,941
Yeah! I did it!

983
01:07:54,229 --> 01:07:55,947
You got guts, kid.

984
01:07:56,231 --> 01:07:57,869
Too bad I gotta rip them out of you.

985
01:07:58,149 --> 01:08:00,026
I don't know what PIankton's
paying you,

986
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:02,878
but if you Iet us go,
I can make it worth your whiIe.

987
01:08:03,195 --> 01:08:05,425
It's gonna take a Iot more than 5...

988
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:09,175
- What is this?
- That, sir, is five Goober doIIars.

989
01:08:09,534 --> 01:08:12,571
LegaI tender at any participating
Goofy Goober--

990
01:08:12,912 --> 01:08:15,346
I got bubbIes. Fun at parties.

991
01:08:16,082 --> 01:08:17,879
My eyes.

992
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:19,964
I got you, SpongeBob.

993
01:08:20,252 --> 01:08:22,129
Thanks, buddy.

994
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,489
Thanks a Iot.

995
01:08:23,755 --> 01:08:25,268
That's it.

996
01:08:25,548 --> 01:08:27,140
I'm through messing around.

997
01:08:27,425 --> 01:08:29,939
See you Iater, fooIs.

998
01:08:37,016 --> 01:08:38,654
See you.

999
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,869
So you think...

1000
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:44,258
...I'm...

1001
01:08:44,565 --> 01:08:46,760
...staIIing.

1002
01:08:47,067 --> 01:08:48,944
Where am I, in Crazytown?

1003
01:08:49,235 --> 01:08:53,308
I have had enough of this nonsense!

1004
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:58,896
You are to wait in the carriage
untiI the execution is done.

1005
01:09:00,453 --> 01:09:02,887
- But, Daddy--
- Now!

1006
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:07,645
No, no, no!

1007
01:09:07,918 --> 01:09:10,637
Oh, SpongeBob, wherever you are,
you better hurry.

1008
01:09:13,298 --> 01:09:17,337
Okay, feIIas, this is where you get off.
Bikini Bottom's directIy beIow.

1009
01:09:17,718 --> 01:09:19,993
But we'II never be abIe
to fIoat down in time.

1010
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:22,898
Who said anything about fIoating?

1011
01:09:23,682 --> 01:09:26,958
<i>- lnitiating launch sequence.
- What the--?</i>

1012
01:09:28,978 --> 01:09:32,209
- Did you see that?
- The controI.

1013
01:09:33,857 --> 01:09:36,087
AII hands on deck.

1014
01:09:37,193 --> 01:09:40,788
<i>Ten seconds to lift-off. Nine, eight...</i>

1015
01:09:41,155 --> 01:09:45,114
Eugene Krabs, the time has come...

1016
01:09:45,492 --> 01:09:47,050
- No.
- Yes.

1017
01:09:47,327 --> 01:09:48,965
<i>...six, five...</i>

1018
01:09:49,246 --> 01:09:50,201
...for you...

1019
01:09:50,455 --> 01:09:52,013
- No.
- Yes.

1020
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:53,803
<i>...three, two...</i>

1021
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:55,641
- ...to fry.
- No.

1022
01:09:55,918 --> 01:09:58,148
<i>- Yes.
- ...one.</i>

1023
01:10:02,757 --> 01:10:04,236
No!

1024
01:10:07,178 --> 01:10:09,817
You done good, HasseIhoff.
You done--

1025
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:17,387
Hooray! We made it.

1026
01:10:17,687 --> 01:10:20,042
We made it.

1027
01:10:24,943 --> 01:10:27,218
My crown.

1028
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:31,204
My beautifuI crown!

1029
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:37,072
SpongeBob? Patrick?
I knew you couId do it.

1030
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,118
Oh, yes. WeII done, SpongeBoob.

1031
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:53,560
Sorry to rain
on your parade, PIankton.

1032
01:10:53,885 --> 01:10:56,080
Oh, don't worry about me.

1033
01:10:56,387 --> 01:11:01,859
My parade shaII be quite dry
under my umbreIIa!

1034
01:11:02,309 --> 01:11:04,618
UmbreIIa?

1035
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:11,218
Daddy, no.

1036
01:11:11,483 --> 01:11:13,758
Daddy, yes.

1037
01:11:17,947 --> 01:11:20,745
<i>All hail Plankton.</i>

1038
01:11:22,618 --> 01:11:27,487
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1039
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:34,228
<i>All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.</i>

1040
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,263
SpongeBob, what happened?

1041
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:39,504
- PIankton cheated.
- Cheated?

1042
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,950
HoId on there, baIdy.

1043
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,329
Oh, grow up.

1044
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:46,667
What, you think this is a game
of kickbaII on the pIayground?

1045
01:11:47,014 --> 01:11:50,051
You never had a chance
to defeat me, fooI.

1046
01:11:50,392 --> 01:11:51,791
And you know why?

1047
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,493
Because you cheated?

1048
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:57,399
No, not because I cheated.
Because I'm an eviI genius.

1049
01:11:57,774 --> 01:11:59,810
And you're just a kid.

1050
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:02,918
A stupid kid.

1051
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,180
I guess you're right, PIankton.
I am just a kid.

1052
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,969
Of course I'm right.
Okay, Neptune, time to kiII.

1053
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:17,246
And you know, I've been through
a Iot in the past six days,

1054
01:12:17,582 --> 01:12:20,050
five minutes,
27-and-a-haIf seconds.

1055
01:12:20,376 --> 01:12:22,970
And if I've Iearned anything
during that time,

1056
01:12:23,296 --> 01:12:25,491
it's that you are who you are.

1057
01:12:25,798 --> 01:12:30,872
- That's right. Okay, Neptune--
- And no amount of mermaid magic...

1058
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:34,773
...or manageriaI promotion...

1059
01:12:35,139 --> 01:12:36,857
...or some other third thing...

1060
01:12:37,141 --> 01:12:40,451
...can make me anything more
than what I reaIIy am inside:

1061
01:12:40,978 --> 01:12:42,696
- A kid.
- That's great.

1062
01:12:42,979 --> 01:12:45,174
- Now, get back against the waII.
- But that's okay.

1063
01:12:45,481 --> 01:12:47,153
- What? What's going on?
- Because I did

1064
01:12:47,442 --> 01:12:49,398
what everyone said
a kid couIdn't do.

1065
01:12:49,693 --> 01:12:52,969
I made it to SheII City,
and I beat the CycIops,

1066
01:12:53,322 --> 01:12:57,315
and I rode the HasseIhoff,
and I brought the crown back.

1067
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,453
- AII right, we get the point.
- So, yeah, I'm a kid.

1068
01:13:00,786 --> 01:13:03,095
And I'm aIso a goofbaII.
And a wing nut.

1069
01:13:03,414 --> 01:13:05,450
And a KnuckIehead McSpazatron!

1070
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,855
- What's going on here?
- But most of aII, I'm...

1071
01:13:09,169 --> 01:13:11,808
- Okay, settIe down. Take it easy.
- I'm... I'm...

1072
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:13,245
What the scaIIop?!

1073
01:13:13,506 --> 01:13:14,734
<i>l'm a Goofy Goober</i>

1074
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,489
<i>You're a Goofy Goober</i>

1075
01:13:21,846 --> 01:13:24,599
<i>We're all Goofy Goobers</i>

1076
01:13:26,809 --> 01:13:30,006
<i>Goofy, goofy, goober, goober</i>

1077
01:13:32,606 --> 01:13:35,200
<i>Put your toys away
Well, all l gotta say</i>

1078
01:13:35,525 --> 01:13:37,243
<i>When you tell me not to play
l say no way</i>

1079
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:40,200
<i>- No way!
- No, no freaking way</i>

1080
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:44,165
<i>l'm a kid, you say
When you say l'm a kid</i>

1081
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:46,243
<i>l say, ''Say it again''
And then l say thanks</i>

1082
01:13:46,534 --> 01:13:49,002
<i>- Thanks!
- Thank you very much</i>

1083
01:13:51,038 --> 01:13:54,508
<i>So if you're thinking
That you'd like to be like me</i>

1084
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:58,345
<i>Go ahead and try
The kid inside will set you free</i>

1085
01:14:03,132 --> 01:14:04,451
<i>l'm a Goofy Goober</i>

1086
01:14:07,636 --> 01:14:09,194
What's happening?

1087
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:15,849
His dance moves are impressive,
but I'm in controI.

1088
01:14:16,227 --> 01:14:19,776
<i>- Seize him!
- All hail Plankton.</i>

1089
01:14:47,504 --> 01:14:49,699
I'm free. I've been freed!

1090
01:14:50,006 --> 01:14:51,519
What?

1091
01:14:52,592 --> 01:14:53,820
No!

1092
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,828
My precious heImets!

1093
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:21,067
His chops are too righteous.

1094
01:15:21,366 --> 01:15:25,075
The heImets can't handIe
this IeveI of rock 'n' roII.

1095
01:15:25,453 --> 01:15:27,808
Karen, do something.

1096
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:29,768
Karen?

1097
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:35,318
AII right, that's the Iast straw.

1098
01:15:35,629 --> 01:15:38,905
Neptune, I command you to...

1099
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:43,284
- Here you go, Daddy.
- I better get out of here.

1100
01:15:44,428 --> 01:15:46,658
Look, it's the wizard who saved us.

1101
01:15:46,972 --> 01:15:48,963
Out of my way, fooIs.

1102
01:16:01,234 --> 01:16:04,067
Come on, I was just kidding.

1103
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:08,424
Come on, you guys knew that,
didn't you?

1104
01:16:10,242 --> 01:16:11,880
With the heImets
and the big monuments...

1105
01:16:12,327 --> 01:16:14,636
Wasn't that hiIarious, everybody?

1106
01:16:14,955 --> 01:16:17,469
I wiII destroy aII of you!

1107
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:21,264
WeII, Mindy, I have to admit,
you were right.

1108
01:16:21,627 --> 01:16:23,538
Your compassion
for these sea creatures

1109
01:16:23,837 --> 01:16:25,555
proved a most admirabIe trait.

1110
01:16:25,839 --> 01:16:30,276
Without it, I wouId have never
again seen my beIoved crown.

1111
01:16:30,676 --> 01:16:34,225
I think you're going to make a fine
ruIer of the sea one day.

1112
01:16:34,597 --> 01:16:36,474
- Now, Iet's go home.
- Daddy,

1113
01:16:36,765 --> 01:16:38,323
haven't you forgotten something?

1114
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,875
What? Oh, yeah.

1115
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:45,759
Eugene Krabs,
I forgot to unfreeze you.

1116
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:50,091
What the--?

1117
01:16:51,319 --> 01:16:53,230
I guess I had it set to
''reaI boy'' ending.

1118
01:16:57,825 --> 01:17:01,420
Oh, I'm sorry
for faIseIy freezing you, Krabs.

1119
01:17:01,787 --> 01:17:05,177
And may I say, sir,
you are a very Iucky feIIow

1120
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,418
to have in your empIoy
such a brave, faithfuI

1121
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:11,470
and heroic young Iad.

1122
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:15,129
- Where is he, anyway?
- I'm up here.

1123
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,440
I'm on it.

1124
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:27,733
Go to him now, Krabs.
Embrace him.

1125
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:32,272
SpongeBob, me boy,
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

1126
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:34,478
That's a mistake I won't make again.

1127
01:17:34,774 --> 01:17:37,811
Oh, Mr. Krabs, you oId soft-serve.

1128
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:41,030
And now, SpongeBob,
I'm gonna do something

1129
01:17:41,363 --> 01:17:43,752
that I shouId've done six days ago.

1130
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:47,145
Mr. Squidward,
front and centre, pIease.

1131
01:17:47,493 --> 01:17:52,169
I think we aII know who rightfuIIy
deserves to wear that manager pin.

1132
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:54,731
I couIdn't agree more, sir.

1133
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:57,430
Hooray for SpongeBob!

1134
01:18:01,088 --> 01:18:02,646
Wait a second, everybody.

1135
01:18:02,923 --> 01:18:04,914
There's something I need to say first.

1136
01:18:05,217 --> 01:18:06,935
I just don't know how to put it.

1137
01:18:07,218 --> 01:18:09,368
I think I know what it is.

1138
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:12,477
After going on
your Iife-changing journey,

1139
01:18:12,807 --> 01:18:17,039
you now reaIize you don't want
what you thought you wanted.

1140
01:18:17,436 --> 01:18:22,510
What you reaIIy wanted
was inside you aII aIong.

1141
01:18:23,191 --> 01:18:26,501
Are you crazy? I was just gonna
teII you that your fIy is down.

1142
01:18:27,027 --> 01:18:30,861
Manager! This is
the greatest day of my Iife!

1143
01:26:28,986 --> 01:26:31,056
You know, David HasseIhoff
is a great artist.

1144
01:26:31,363 --> 01:26:32,591
Excuse me, sir.

1145
01:26:34,116 --> 01:26:35,310
You foIks have to Ieave.

1146
01:26:36,826 --> 01:26:40,660
What? Say that again, if you dare.

1147
01:26:41,038 --> 01:26:43,154
You foIks have to Ieave.

1148
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,877
Okay.
