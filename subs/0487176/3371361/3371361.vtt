1
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.760 
I leave you alone for an hour,
and you destroy my house?

2
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.600 
And, you, you're no better.

3
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.520 
You're both evicted!

4
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.000 
Yes, this could all be yours.

5
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.480 
This mansion with
all the amenities.

6
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.520 
Located in the bucolic,
exclusive surroundings...

7
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.200 
... of Pine Valley Ranch Hills Estates.

8
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.960 
This mansion overlooks
the tranquil landscape...

9
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.520 
... of the Pine Valley Ranch Hills Estates
golf course and the cemetery.

10
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.680 
This is the key
that can open the door...

11
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.360 
... to your future as a person
who lives in a really big house!

12
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.200 
And it could all be yours
if you are the winner...

13
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.200 
... of The Fabulous Super Race.

14
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.680 
J. W. Globwobbler's latest
television extravaganza.

15
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.920 
To enter this contest,
participants must supply...

16
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.000 
... their own all-terrain vehicles,
and come on down...

17
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.560 
... to Globwobbler Studios
in beautiful Hollywood, U. S.A.!

18
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.600 
Only one spot remains. Enter today!

19
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.040 
It could belong to you! Enter today!

20
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.400 
Now look, Clown-O,
your ratings are plummeting.

21
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.920 
I have an idea
how to juice your show up...

22
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.200 
...and pull your polka-dotted keister
out of the fire. You need a partner.

23
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.160 
A partner?

24
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.640 
Yep. An animal partner.

25
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.920 
What? Like a dog? A monkey?
A parrot maybe?

26
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.360 
Irving, wheel in Mr. Frisky.

27
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.880 
Hey, I thought you kids' show hosts
liked animals.

28
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.160 
We do, sir, but this animal looks
a little dangerous.

29
00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.040 
Clown-O, animals can sense
negative vibrations...

30
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.800 
...so get off that chair
and say hello to Mr. Frisky.

31
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.200 
I want you and Mr. Frisky to begin
working up an act right away.

32
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.360 
Good dog.

33
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.600 
Stop! Get him off of me! No! No!

34
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.800 
Hey, get him off of me!

35
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.240 
-Mommy!
-I'm a genius!

36
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:18.040 
That bear's got talent, moxie, pizzazz!
What's next?

37
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.240 
Well, sir, if you'll remember,
we're still looking...

38
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.080 
...for one more contestant to round out
The Fabulous Super Race.

39
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.880 
I need something crazy and wild,
something totally unexpected.

40
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.360 
Halt!

41
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.600 
Action!

42
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.960 
And this is our stunt area.

43
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.480 
These are all trained professionals.
Don't try this at home.

44
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.080 
-Take my hand, Clarice!
-I love you, Frank!

45
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.280 
What's this?

46
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.520 
From the looks of things,
they're here to audition...

47
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.840 
...for the remaining slot
in The Fabulous Super Race.

48
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.520 
Is this some kind of a joke?
A pussycat and a mouse?

49
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.280 
This is about stunts
and people putting their lives at risk...

50
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.640 
...for a big fat prize.
It's not a nature documentary.

51
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.920 
-Call security and have these two--
-Sir! Sir, it's...

52
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.600 
...him.

53
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.240 
-This gives me the creeps.
-He's the president of Hollywood.

54
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.000 
He's supposed to give you
the creeps.

55
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.360 
Greetings, Your Tinselyness.
Imperious leader of Hollywood.

56
00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.680 
Smile, lrving.

57
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.240 
I'm terrified, sir.

58
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.040 
Now you look, J.W.

59
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.600 
The girls and I overheard what you were
saying about this cat and mouse.

60
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.520 
Yes.

61
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.440 
They want to enter the race.
I was about to call security and--

62
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.680 
This is the greatest single idea for
The Fabulous Super Race show yet!

63
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.720 
Good thinking, J.W.,
you' re really on the ball.

64
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.400 
Yes, Your Sparklyness, thank you.

65
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.400 
I was sure you'd like it.

66
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.320 
From the looks of this cat...

67
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.720 
...I'd be prepared to say he's the type
that would stop at nothing to win.

68
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.200 
Absolutely. It's genius. People love
a rotten-to-the-core villain.

69
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.080 
Someone who will do the things
they only dream about in order to win!

70
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.400 
Remember, J.W., when in doubt,
always stoop as low as you can...

71
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.880 
...and appeal
to people's basest instincts.

72
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.880 
Gosh, thanks, Your Flashiness.
Right again.

73
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.240 
Well, our work here is done, ladies.

74
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.520 
Go forth, J.W. Globwobbler,
and bringeth in the ratings!

75
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.800 
Well, I guess there
are two slots available.

76
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.760 
Boys, you're hired.

77
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.360 
Just sign on the dotted line, boys.

78
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.320 
This will be the greatest reality game
show in the history of TV.

79
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.600 
A show like this could make me
vice president of Hollywood.

80
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.320 
These two are awful, sir.

81
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.280 
Yep. It's perfect!

82
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.160 
And we're live!

83
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.800 
Well, hello, everybody out there
in television land...

84
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.560 
...and welcome to
The Fabulous Super Race.

85
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.720 
I'm Biff Buzzard.

86
00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.600 
And I'm Buzz Blister. We're here
in beautiful Detroit, Michigan--

87
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.080 
We' re here in gorgeous
Hollywood, California!

88
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.040 
That's right, Buzzer,
The Fabulous Super Race.

89
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.240 
It should be more exciting than
anything mankind has yet experienced...

90
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.920 
...in its brief time here
on planet Earth.

91
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.560 
And speaking of planet Earth, Biffster...

92
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.600 
...that's where our race is going
to take place.

93
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.240 
Right, Buzzatola. The race begins
here in Southern California...

94
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.960 
...and ends here in Mexico.

95
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.840 
And this is the "keyako" that opens
the door to our terrific prize...

96
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.520 
-...a huge giant mansion.
-She's a beauty, Buzz.

97
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.480 
And she will go to the winner
of The Fabulous Super Race.

98
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.360 
Let's get down to the pits and
meet our contestants right now.

99
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.520 
You must be...?

100
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.840 
Steed Dirkly at your service.

101
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.320 
And I'd like to say hello to all of my fans
rooting for me, Steed Dirkly.

102
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.680 
And might I just add
that all the proceeds I will win...

103
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.520 
...will be donated
to my favorite charity.

104
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.160 
And what might that be, Steed?

105
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.360 
Me.

106
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.760 
Well, I'm sure that warms the hearts
of America. Steed Dirkly...

107
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.680 
...a true hero with a heart of gold.
Good luck.

108
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.680 
Who have we got here, Buzz-A-Roo?

109
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.840 
Why, it looks like a cute old grandma.

110
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.080 
She looks just as cute and nice...

111
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.200 
...and sweet and old
as she could be, doesn't she?

112
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.800 
Why, thank you, sonny.

113
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.360 
I'm one of those who believes
you're as young as you feel.

114
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:46.240 
I have always been a fan of good
clean fun and honest competition.

115
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.200 
And who's this cute little fella?

116
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.560 
This is Squirty.
Oh, he's my whole world.

117
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.720 
Squirty! Give the nice man
his finger back.

118
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.280 
Animals just don't like you, Biff.
You've got to remember that.

119
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.200 
Well, good luck, Grammy.
And good luck, Squirty.

120
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.960 
And what is your name, sir?

121
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.320 
I am Gorthan, Destroyer of Light.

122
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.760 
I am nervous.
I've never been on TV before.

123
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.600 
Really? Well, you're on TV now.
And where are you from, Mr. Destroyer?

124
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.760 
I'm guessing, from the outfit,
Oakland, California!

125
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.600 
I am from Niltor, near the outer alabaster
tower in the inner ring of green fire...

126
00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.320 
...in the dimension of darkness
ruled by the overlords of dread.

127
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.520 
Nice. And what do you do in Niltor,
Mr. Destroyer?

128
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.320 
I own a flower shop
and a greeting-card store.

129
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.800 
I see.

130
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.040 
And I suppose you're looking
for a shot at that big cash prize...

131
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.440 
-...and that fabulous mansion.
-Y es, that would be nice.

132
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.520 
One does grow weary
of the soul-crushing darkness...

133
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.640 
...and endless screaming
that fill the air of Niltor.

134
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.360 
Mr. Destroyer, I'm curious...

135
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.840 
...what exactly powers this
strange-looking vehicle of yours?

136
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.320 
It is powered by the anguish
of a thousand doomed souls.

137
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.800 
It sounds like he has a soft spot
in his heart for the environment, folks.

138
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.440 
Well, good luck, Gorthan,
Destroyer of Light.

139
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.320 
Thank you, Biff.

140
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.360 
And you must be...?

141
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.880 
Hi! I'm Mallory
from Watertown, Wisconsin.

142
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.800 
Everyone calls me Soccer Mom.

143
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.360 
Okay, Soccer Mom. And you're here in
your souped-up minivan, is that right?

144
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.480 
Y eah. You know, between school
and soccer games...

145
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.120 
...and my online retail business,
I decided I needed a hobby.

146
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.920 
Fantastic, Soccer Mom.
Your kids must be very proud.

147
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.960 
Oh, yeah. Rufus, Gunter, Angus
and Shylock are all very proud.

148
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.320 
All those boys must be a handful.

149
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.080 
No, Angus is a girl. Hi, kids!
Don't forget to water the sheep!

150
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.040 
Oh, and no swordplay in the house
while Mommy's gone, okay?

151
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.560 
Well, as the French say,
bueno el lucko to you, Soccer Mom.

152
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.000 
And that brings us to...?

153
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.360 
I am Dr. Professor...

154
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.760 
...a super-resourceful genius.

155
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.880 
And I will no doubt be
the winner of this race.

156
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.080 
As we all know, science is golden.

157
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.560 
That looks like a pretty sophisticated
piece of machinery...

158
00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.040 
-...you have there, doctor.
-Yes, it is.

159
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.760 
And what kind of gas does it take?

160
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.400 
-Antimatter.
-lsn't that the most explosive...

161
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.720 
...and powerful energy source
known to mankind?

162
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:15.720 
This is it. My own specially designed
antimatter engine. I never have to refuel.

163
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.920 
It uses the most efficient
and powerful fuel source.

164
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.680 
So, what happens if this stuff
touches matter?

165
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.920 
It would instantly vaporize anything
in its vicinity.

166
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.240 
What's this little thingy here do?

167
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.000 
No! Don't touch that!

168
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.720 
That technology thing is certainly
moving fast, isn't it, Biff?

169
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.360 
Boy, I'll say.

170
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.720 
And here we have a pussycat
and a mouse.

171
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.440 
I didn't realize that vermin
were eligible, Biff.

172
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.760 
And who on earth gave this pussycat
a driver's license?

173
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.720 
And what do you two have to say
to our viewers at home?

174
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.160 
That's right. They're animals, Biff,
and they can't talk.

175
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.120 
No, sir, but apparently they can drive.

176
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.920 
Hey! Look at this
little mouse-sized car.

177
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.240 
It's cute.

178
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.920 
What can you get this baby up
to, little mouse? Four?

179
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.880 
-"Four. "
-What's this little button here do?

180
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.440 
Okay. Okay, folks. With that,
we are ready to get underway.

181
00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:00.680 
And we'll see you all
at the finish line in Mexico.

182
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.080 
And there they go!

183
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.240 
Attaboy, Squirty!

184
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.360 
Our contestants are going to have
to employ the first of their vehicles'...

185
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:33.360 
...special modifications to get around
this notorious Southern California traffic.

186
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.040 
And it looks like
they are doing just that, Biff.

187
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.000 
Okay. I know just what to do now.

188
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.600 
Hey, what's that pussycat up to, Biff?

189
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.560 
No good it looks like to me, Buzz.

190
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.520 
-That was a close one, Buzz.
-That pussycat is dynamite!

191
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.720 
Well, it looks like pretty boy
is gaining, Squirty.

192
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.400 
Squirty! No! Bad dog!

193
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.160 
Oh, Squirty! No! Drop it! Drop it!

194
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.600 
This naughty pussycat would do well
in the pits of Niltor.

195
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.920 
Perhaps one of my stink pods will
give him a taste of his own medicine.

196
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.280 
It's a hit, sir!

197
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.440 
It's an ultra, super,
dynamic mega hit, lrving!

198
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.640 
We can't end this thing in Mexico!

199
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.560 
Call the crew, tell them
to move the finish line.

200
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.480 
To where, sir?

201
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.600 
Irving, which one of these shapes
is Mexico?

202
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.960 
-This one here, sir.
-Let's see...

203
00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.240 
...how about if we take them to....

204
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.320 
And here come the racers, Buzz!

205
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.680 
Hey, I won! Give me that key.

206
00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.000 
Not so fast.

207
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.160 
Was that a speed bump?

208
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.200 
Oh, heavenly days. Did I win?

209
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.160 
Now, don't get too excited there, racers.

210
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.840 
We've just received word
from our Hollywood studio...

211
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.440 
...that due to high ratings, The Fabulous
Super Race is going to be extended.

212
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.520 
The next finish line
is located deep in the heart...

213
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.520 
-...of the Amazon jungle.
-What? What are you talking about?

214
00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.360 
Isn't that great?

215
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.480 
Hello again, folks.

216
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.840 
Buzz Blister here in the heart of
the Amazon jungle with my cohost, Biff.

217
00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.880 
Our racers are forging
intrepidly ahead through...

218
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.360 
...this dense jungle on their way
to this very unstable...

219
00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.400 
...and rickety-looking bridge.

220
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.360 
Here come our racers!

221
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.520 
Oh, it looks like Steed Dirkly.

222
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.640 
That was a close one, Buzz.

223
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.240 
Y es, it sure was, Biff.
And here comes--

224
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.920 
Oh, it looks like Grammy.

225
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.520 
I hope she can negotiate the bridge
with those slats missing.

226
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.960 
I'm right on your tail, pretty boy!

227
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.920 
Oh, no! It looks like
Grammy's in trouble, Buzz!

228
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.040 
It certainly does. And it's just too bad
that the rules prevent us...

229
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.080 
...from coming to the rescue
of that sweet, very old lady.

230
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.120 
No, that would be cheating, Buzz.

231
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.920 
So if this lady snaps through the rotten
wooden slats of this ancient bridge...

232
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.480 
...and falls to her doom,
we'll just have to go to a commercial.

233
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.600 
She just seems so helpless and delicate.

234
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.000 
So weak, so scrawny.

235
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.440 
So noodly and frothy.

236
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.200 
So crunchy and creamy.

237
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.560 
Pretty impressive.

238
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.280 
Hey! Looks like Gorthan, Destroyer of
Light, is making his crossing now.

239
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.320 
-Gorthan's in trouble, Biff!
-Wow, he sure is, Buzz!

240
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.160 
That heavy metal car of his may be
too much for that old bridge to handle.

241
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.560 
Knargack the Black-Winged...

242
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.400 
...I summon thee to appear
and use thine hideous powers...

243
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.800 
...to lifteth me-eth over
this obstacle-eth.

244
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.640 
Gorthan, that was some trick!

245
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.120 
Did you train that bird yourself?

246
00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.000 
Oh, no. Knargack's soul belongs
to that of a vanquished foe...

247
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.640 
...who's now trapped
and forced to serve.

248
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.640 
Can it talk? Could we get
an interview with it?

249
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.320 
I have to get going.
I'm falling behind.

250
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:19.360 
Right. Well, good to see you again,
Gorthan, Destroyer of Light.

251
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.360 
Thank you, Buzz.
Always great to see you.

252
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.160 
I wouldn't have pegged him
as an animal lover.

253
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.000 
I wonder who will be next, Biff.

254
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.400 
That's funny. That doesn't look
like what's on my map, not at all.

255
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.240 
Oh, well, signs don't lie.

256
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:12.400 
Oh, darn. I just had this washed.
I'd better call GoneStar.

257
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.400 
Hello. Thank you for calling GoneStar's
remote assistance department.

258
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.360 
My name is Dave.
Would you like to subscribe...

259
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.360 
-... to our free music download offer?
-Oh, no, thank you, Dave.

260
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.920 
See, I have an emergency going on now.

261
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.200 
I see. Well, let me locate you
on my screen.

262
00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.600 
You are Mallory MacDoogle,
a soccer mom.

263
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.000 
I have you pinpointed in a remote
and unexplored region...

264
00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.920 
... of the Amazonian jungle.

265
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.480 
-And what seems to be the trouble?
-See now, that's just it.

266
00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.320 
I' m sinking in deadly quicksand
and I need help getting out now.

267
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.640 
I'm afraid I can 't do that, Mallory.

268
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.440 
Just kidding. Well, let's consult
our GoneStar quicksand computer...

269
00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.120 
...and see if we can 't
get you out of there.

270
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.600 
Simply follow the prompts
on your screen.

271
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.120 
There are many types of quicksand
on our interesting planet.

272
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:15.000 
There is desert quicksand,
swamp quicksand and jungle quicksand.

273
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.520 
You have selected jungle quicksand.

274
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.360 
Now please choose
the jungle you are in.

275
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.360 
Are you in A, the Belgian Congo...

276
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.240 
...B, a Southeast Asian jungle
or C, the Amazonian jungle?

277
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.960 
Amazonian, yeah.

278
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.560 
Now choose what you would like to do
with the quicksand you have selected.

279
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:45.200 
Would you like to A, make quicksand,
B, garden with quicksand...

280
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.760 
... or C, get out of quicksand?

281
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.360 
To get out, press--

282
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.160 
Wait a ding-dang minute here.

283
00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.880 
You know, I think somebody
might've done this on purpose.

284
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.680 
Oh, no, don't go that way, little mouse.
The race is this way, yeah!

285
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.760 
My van sank in the quicksand,
so I guess I'm out.

286
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.400 
Here, have an orange.
It will give you energy.

287
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.640 
Good luck!

288
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.400 
-Too bad about Soccer Mom, Buzz.
-Yes, I was kind of rooting for her.

289
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.880 
But what's this?
That crazy pussycat...

290
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.360 
...has stopped at the end of the bridge.
He's got a saw.

291
00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.760 
I sense a dirty trick coming up.

292
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.560 
Looks like that one backfired
on the pussycat.

293
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.720 
It sure does, Buzzalito.

294
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.360 
And this river is infested with
pussycat-eating piranha fish.

295
00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:49.560 
-That's Tierra del Fuego, sir.
-And that?

296
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.800 
That would be the Antarctic, sir.

297
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.400 
Fantastic!

298
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.400 
The racers will have to modify their cars
and sail across water to make it there.

299
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.440 
That should boost the ratings
even higher!

300
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.440 
Folks, I've just heard from Hollywood
and have received some terrific news...

301
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.760 
...that I'm sure our racers
will be pleased to hear!

302
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.080 
Our racers are now going to head for
the southernmost tip of South America...

303
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.360 
...where they will prepare
for the difficult crossing...

304
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.120 
...from Cape Horn to the Antarctic.

305
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.080 
And won't our racers be excited
and happy to hear that!

306
00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.000 
And here they come!

307
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.680 
-Give me that key!
-Not so fast, Steed.

308
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.280 
Biff has some news for you all!

309
00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.200 
That's right, all. The race
has been extended.

310
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.800 
And we will see each and all of you
in the Antarctic! Good luck, everyone!

311
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.000 
Avast, Squirty!

312
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.800 
It'll take more than a little drizzle
to keep us from winning.

313
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.880 
This reminds me of sailing
Blood Blister Bay back in Niltor.

314
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.680 
No, this is terrible. Stop sinking!

315
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.600 
Well, maybe this isn't so bad after all.

316
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.240 
Well, Miss Mermaid...

317
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:56.920 
...you are in luck. Because Steed Dirkly
has just washed upon your shore.

318
00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.640 
And as soon as you dry
these damp clothes, I'll reward you...

319
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.720 
...by letting you fix my dinner.

320
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.680 
Hey, this just in, Biffo.

321
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.040 
Oh, some disappointing news
from the Southern Atlantic.

322
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:22.520 
It seems Steed Dirkly is being parboiled
in a briny bouillabaisse...

323
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.560 
...and served
with a caper dill cream mousseline.

324
00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:30.640 
Buzzby, he's out of the race.
But he sounds delicious.

325
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.960 
Well, Gorthan, congratulations on being
the first one to make it to the Antarctic.

326
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.880 
Thank you, Buzz. And hello, Biff.

327
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.560 
Say, Gorthan, have you ever heard
that thing...

328
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.080 
...about sticking your tongue
on a piece of frozen metal?

329
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.840 
No. What do you mean?

330
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.920 
Well, Gorthan, they say
if you touch your tongue...

331
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.400 
...on a frozen piece of metal,
it will stick.

332
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.680 
-What?
-Yes. What do you think, Gorthan?

333
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.400 
Will it stick, yes or no?

334
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.400 
Well, no, that's nonsense.
The answer is no. It wouldn't stick.

335
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.720 
Well, what about putting your money
where your mouth is, Gorthan?

336
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.400 
-What do you mean?
-Well, we have the south pole right here.

337
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.760 
Why not give it a try?

338
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.440 
What? You mean, stick my tongue
on this stupid metal pole here?

339
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.720 
Who would have thought that
the so-called Destroyer of Light...

340
00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.920 
-...was really just a big wimp.
-Look, I'm warning you!

341
00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:38.080 
No need to resort to evil magic, Gorthan.
If you think your tongue won't stick...

342
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.800 
...just go ahead and show us.

343
00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.560 
All right. If only to prove to you mortals
that you are wrong! Here.

344
00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.960 
Well, go on, Gorthan.

345
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.600 
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

346
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.240 
There. You see? I told you.

347
00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.120 
-Told you.
-I knew it.

348
00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.960 
Hey, Buzz, look.

349
00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.840 
The ice is cracking.

350
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.600 
Gosh, you're right, Biff-O-Rama.
Let's hop over to safety.

351
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:15.080 
Hey, what about me? Come on, fellas.

352
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.320 
And it looks like Gorthan
is out of the race.

353
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.200 
It sure does, Buzzo.

354
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.200 
But at least we proved once and for all
that your tongue will stick...

355
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.640 
-...to a metal pole if it's cold enough.
-And that's something.

356
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.640 
I curse your souls, mortals!

357
00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.800 
Boy, somebody sure is a sore loser.

358
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.160 
That leaves the pussycat, the mouse
and, of course, Grammy.

359
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.960 
Yes. And here they are.

360
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.600 
Let's have a word with Grammy.

361
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.520 
Say, Grammy,
I'm sure the folks at home...

362
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.160 
...would like to know how you feel
about the race thus far.

363
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000 
Well, it's a wonderful competition.

364
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.840 
It's good for a person to participate...

365
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.160 
...in old-fashioned, clean,
wholesome fun!

366
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.720 
Squirty. Squirty!

367
00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.840 
Grammy's coming!

368
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.720 
Mr. Pussycat...

369
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.280 
...how are you going to sleep at night
after a rotten trick like that?

370
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.440 
I think he'll sleep just fine, Buzz.

371
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.080 
Looks like the pussycat is in the lead.

372
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.920 
Well, it seems we are down
to only two competitors now, Biffy.

373
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.240 
That's right. A cat and a mouse.

374
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.160 
A predator and the prey.

375
00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.080 
-The overdog and the underdog.
-The eater and the eaten.

376
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:35.000 
-The big and the small.
-Okay, Biff, I think we get the idea.

377
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.760 
Just take a look at the ratings
for the show, sir.

378
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.400 
Holy cow, they're through the roof!

379
00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.760 
If this doesn't make me vice president
of Hollywood, I don't know what will.

380
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.120 
We gotta keep this up.

381
00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.480 
What can we do to make the show
more exciting? Where are they?

382
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.240 
They're racing across the Antarctic.
The next stop is Australia.

383
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.800 
Australia, huh?
Isn't that where Mozart is from?

384
00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.520 
No. That's Austria, sir.

385
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:31.000 
Oh, right. So how should we
have them get there?

386
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.200 
Well, standard procedure
is to fly or sail, sir.

387
00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.680 
You gotta learn how to think
out of the box, lrving.

388
00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:42.000 
But how else would they get there?
There's an enormous body of water...

389
00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.680 
-...between the Antarctic and Australia.
-Precisely.

390
00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.680 
-You mean...?
-Yes, keep going.

391
00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.680 
-Underwater, sir?
-Bingo!

392
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.400 
That's the kind of thinking
that will keep you out of the mailroom.

393
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:03.000 
The leg of the race between Antarctica
and Australia will be held underwater.

394
00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.960 
It'll be a television first.

395
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.720 
Let's just see how high
we can get these ratings to go.

396
00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.480 
Well, I see the mouse, Buzz,
but no sign of the pussyc-- Wait!

397
00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.800 
His car is there, but the pussycat
is not in the vehicle.

398
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.840 
As we all know, the contestant must be
in his vehicle in order to stay in the race.

399
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.800 
Congratulations, Mr. Mouse!
You have taken the lead.

400
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:50.360 
You're that much closer
to owning your very own mansion.

401
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.760 
Now it's time to modify your vehicle...

402
00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:57.320 
...because the next leg of the race
to Australia is taking place.

403
00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.440 
Underwater.

404
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.600 
T ough break for the pussycat.

405
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:21.480 
Yes, cats don't like water at all.
Especially this one.

406
00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.440 
Mr. Globwobbler, sir,
the pussycat is out of the race.

407
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:33.800 
I love that cat. That backstabbing
feline drove our ratings through the roof.

408
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.200 
-Get him back in the race!
-Y es, sir.

409
00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.400 
T ake it easy, Punchy. Oh, we're on.

410
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.680 
G'day all you mates and sheilas.
We're here--

411
00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.320 
Biff, no, it's "g'day. "

412
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:01.800 
Like, duh, you pronounce
the "guh" sound.

413
00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.840 
Well, now I'm all self-conscious
and it sounds weird to me.

414
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.680 
I think you better do it.

415
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.080 
All right. Then here, you take Punchy.

416
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:16.640 
I don't think this kangaroo
likes me very much, Buzz.

417
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.520 
Nonsense. Take the leash.
G'day, folks.

418
00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:25.880 
We're here down under in beautiful, hot,
humid, bug-infested Australia.

419
00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:31.040 
And, folks, say hello to our Australian
ambassador of good will, Punchy...

420
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.680 
...the boxing kangaroo.
Isn't he cute, folks?

421
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.320 
He's adorable. G'day.

422
00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.800 
The next portion of the race
will take place in the rugged outback.

423
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.920 
Isn't that right, Biff?

424
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:52.200 
Then on north up to Weipa
in the northernmost portion of Australia.

425
00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:55.680 
The next leg of our race is about
to begin. Here they come!

426
00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.960 
It looks like Grammy.

427
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.480 
Yes. And that's amazing.

428
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.280 
Because the last time we saw her,
she had been eaten by a whale.

429
00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.600 
Never underestimate the elderly, Buzz.

430
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.560 
Especially Grammy.

431
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:17.200 
No, sir. This old bat
is full of surprises.

432
00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.360 
Hey, it's the mouse.

433
00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.920 
Any sign of the pussycat,
Mr. Mouse?

434
00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.560 
I think it's curtains
for the pussycat, Buzz.

435
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:38.560 
And that's too bad. His rotten attitude
was making this race so exciting.

436
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.920 
Well, good luck, rodent.

437
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.440 
Oh, my little spud! I love you!

438
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.920 
Let's burn rubber, Squirty!

439
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.240 
Wait a minute, Biff, what's that?

440
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.640 
Well, Biff, it looks like the network
has taken a liking to a certain pussycat.

441
00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.840 
Why bother? He can't win.

442
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.080 
Grammy and the rodent
are already halfway across Australia.

443
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.120 
Y es. I think we can stick a fork
in the pussycat, because he's toast.

444
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.800 
And so is his car.

445
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.200 
Well, it's always encouraging
to see a guy who won't give up.

446
00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.480 
Yes. But this case is hopeless.

447
00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.000 
There's no way the pussycat
will be able to make up the gap...

448
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.160 
...between the mouse and Grammy.

449
00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:12.280 
Yes. He'd pretty much have to saw
the entire continent of Australia in half.

450
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.320 
And that's extremely unlikely.

451
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.120 
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

452
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.440 
No! He's not gonna--

453
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.680 
He sure is gonna. That crazy pussycat
is going to saw Australia in half.

454
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.560 
-How about that, folks?
-That's some determined pussycat.

455
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.760 
I'll say, Biff. We'd better get off
this continent...

456
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:41.160 
...before it sinks to the bottom
of Davy Jones' Locker.

457
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:06.160 
Oh, you rotten, dirty pussycat.

458
00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.400 
Well, it serves you right,
you naughty pussycat.

459
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.160 
We're going down, Squirty.
Quick, the parachutes!

460
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.640 
Why, you ungrateful little stinker.

461
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:34.280 
If it weren't for me,
you'd still be at the animal-testing lab...

462
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:39.440 
...having antiperspirant sprayed
in your eyes and drinking paint.

463
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.320 
Geronimo!

464
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.840 
Open the chute, Squirty.
Open the chute!

465
00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.920 
Oh, Squirty, I can't....

466
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.920 
Sir, Grammy is out of the race.
The pussycat did her in.

467
01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.440 
-It's just him and the mouse now.
-This whole caper is falling apart.

468
01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.400 
Listen up, lrving.
This race is taking too long.

469
01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.240 
The public have the attention span
of a cocker spaniel.

470
01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:17.200 
You'd better speed up the last leg of
the race or your sorry butt goes bye-bye.

471
01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.880 
But we told the public this race would go
through the greatest cities in the world.

472
01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.720 
And we haven't even been
to Cleveland yet.

473
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.000 
Irving, the public doesn't want
a bunch of pretty cities.

474
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.960 
They want action.
Action and plenty of explosions.

475
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.520 
Now, I want this race wrapped up
in five minutes, lrving...

476
01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.920 
-...or you'll find yourself sorting mail.
-Yes, sir.

477
01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:51.560 
Well, it looks like the lower life forms
have taken the lead.

478
01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.600 
That's right, Buzz-Buzz,
and just as well.

479
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.720 
I think they've done something
for the self-esteem...

480
01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.440 
...of fur-covered animals everywhere.

481
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.880 
Tom and Jerry, as the only
surviving drivers in our Super Race...

482
01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:28.480 
...we're giving you two nuclear-powered,
rocket-car, jet-plane, hovercraft things.

483
01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.480 
And there's a teensy change in plans.

484
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.320 
You've only got five minutes
to finish the race!

485
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.440 
That's right.
Once you racers leave Borneo...

486
01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.440 
...you'll cross Europe and the
Atlantic Ocean to the good old U.S. of A.

487
01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.840 
There you'll cross the continent to reach
the finish line in Hollywood, California...

488
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.120 
...in five minutes!

489
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.400 
So good luck.
And may the best lower species win.

490
01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.920 
Biffette, we're here at the finish line,
where the crowd waits anxiously...

491
01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.160 
...to see if the winner
will be the cat or the mouse.

492
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.520 
Holy smokes, folks.

493
01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.160 
We can hear them heading
right this way.

494
01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.520 
They're neck and neck.
Isn't that right, Biff?

495
01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.400 
That's right.

496
01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.480 
I too can hardly speak anything articulate
with all this excitement.

497
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.520 
At those speeds, how long do you think
it'll take them to reach the finish line?

498
01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:14.720 
I'm with you. It's hard to form even
a simple sentence with this excitement.

499
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.800 
But who will win? The cat or the mouse?
Feline or rodent? Pet or pest?

500
01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:23.200 
The couch-scratcher
or the cheese-nibbler? Who, Biff, who?

501
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.920 
And here they come, folks. What
an incredible final lap. Right, Biffaroni?

502
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.440 
And they're a mere 5 feet from
the finish line. And in the lead is T om.

503
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.440 
No, Jerry. No, Tom. No, Jerry!

504
01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.440 
Tom. Jerry. Tom. Jerry.

505
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.080 
Tom! Jer--

506
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:24.920 
T! J!

507
01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.160 
-It's a tie!
-It's a tie!

508
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.000 
Congratulations, boys.
I've got good news and bad news.

509
01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:51.160 
The good news is, you just finished
the most spectacular race in history.

510
01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.440 
The bad news is, it's a tie.

511
01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.280 
And your contract says
you'll both have to do the race...

512
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.960 
...all over again.

513
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:48.000 
From now on, Hollywood is going
to stand for morality, wholesomeness...

514
01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.800 
...good, clean, family entertainment.

515
01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.520 
What's gotten into him?

516
01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.800 
We can't have that kind of attitude
in Hollywood.

517
01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.680 
Well, today is your lucky day, lrving.

518
01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.640 
Or should I say new head
of Globwobbler Studios!

519
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.200 
Gosh. Head of Globwobbler Studios.

520
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.960 
Well, how nice of you
to get me a new home...

521
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.760 
...since you wrecked my old one.
And while we're--

522
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.080 
Tom, there's that mouse again.
Get that mouse out of our house!

523
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:56.280 
Well, don't just stand there,
do something! Get going! Go on, hurry!

524
01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.120 
Get that mouse out!
