1
00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.011
Ah!

2
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.011
Arrgh!

3
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:04.613
I leave you alone for an hour,
and you destroy my house?

4
00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:08.450
And, you, you're no better.

5
00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.413
You're both evicted!

6
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.919
Yes, this could all be yours.

7
00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:21.338
This mansion with
all the amenities.

8
00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:25.425
Located in the bucolic,
exclusive surroundings...

9
00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.095
...of Pine Valley Ranch Hills Estates.

10
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:31.807
This mansion overlooks
the tranquil landscape...

11
00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:37.437
...of the Pine Valley Ranch Hills Estates
golf course and the cemetery.

12
00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.607
This is the key
that can open the door...

13
00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:44.277
...to your future as a person
who lives in a really big house!

14
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:47.114
And it could all be yours
if you are the winner...

15
00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:49.116
...ofThe Fabulous Super Race.

16
00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:53.537
J.W. Globwobbler's latest
television extravaganza.

17
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.832
To enter this contest,
participants must supply...

18
00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.626
...their own all-terrain vehicles,
and come on down...

19
00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:02.003
...to Globwobbler Studios
in beautiful Hollywood, U.S.A.!

20
00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:07.509
Only one spot remains. Enter today!

21
00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:42.961
It could belong to you! Enter today!

22
00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:18.306
Now look, Clown-O,
your ratings are plummeting.

23
00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.809
I have an idea
how to juice your show up...

24
00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:25.146
...and pull your polka-dotted keister
out of the fire. You need a partner.

25
00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:27.107
A partner?

26
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:29.526
Yep. An animal partner.

27
00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:35.824
What? Like a dog? A monkey?
A parrot maybe?

28
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.286
Irving, wheel in Mr. Frisky.

29
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.834
Hey, I thought you kids' show hosts
liked animals.

30
00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:51.047
We do, sir, but this animal looks
a little dangerous.

31
00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.968
Clown-O, animals can sense
negative vibrations...

32
00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:58.722
...so get off that chair
and say hello to Mr. Frisky.

33
00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:03.143
I want you and Mr. Frisky to begin
working up an act right away.

34
00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.644
Good dog.

35
00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.523
Stop! Get him off of me! No! No!

36
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.692
Hey, get him off of me!

37
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.194
- Mommy!
- I'm a genius!

38
00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:18.992
That bear's got talent, moxie, pizzazz!
What's next?

39
00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:22.203
Well, sir, if you'll remember,
we're still looking...

40
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:26.041
...for one more contestant to round out
The Fabulous Super Race.

41
00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:30.837
I need something crazy and wild,
something totally unexpected.

42
00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:42.265
Halt!

43
00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.392
Wha--? Ah!

44
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:46.728
Ah!

45
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.529
Action!

46
00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:06.915
Whoa! Whoa!

47
00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.925
And this is our stunt area.

48
00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:20.428
These are all trained professionals.
Don't try this at home.

49
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.983
- Take my hand, Clarice!
- I love you, Frank!

50
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.622
Oh-- Hm?

51
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:50.959
Oh! Ah!

52
00:11:57.925 --> 00:11:59.259
What's this?

53
00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.470
From the looks of things,
they're here to audition...

54
00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:05.807
...for the remaining slot
in The Fabulous Super Race.

55
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:09.477
Is this some kind of a joke?
A pussycat and a mouse?

56
00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:13.189
This is about stunts
and people putting their lives at risk...

57
00:12:13.357 --> 00:12:16.609
...for a big fat prize.
It's not a nature documentary.

58
00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:19.863
- Call security and have these two--
- Sir! Sir, it's...

59
00:12:20.948 --> 00:12:22.532
...him.

60
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:38.173
- This gives me the creeps.
- He's the president of Hollywood.

61
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.967
He's supposed to give you
the creeps.

62
00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:54.314
Greetings, Your Tinselyness.
Imperious Ieader of Hollywood.

63
00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:00.653
Smile, Irving.

64
00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:03.198
I'm terrified, sir.

65
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.033
Now you look, J.W.

66
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:09.537
The girls and I overheard what you were
saying about this cat and mouse.

67
00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:11.498
Yes.

68
00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:15.376
They want to enter the race.
I was about to call security and--

69
00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:19.672
This is the greatest single idea for
The Fabulous Super Race show yet!

70
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.718
Good thinking, J.W.,
you're really on the ball.

71
00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:27.388
Uh, yes, Your Sparklyness, thank you.

72
00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:30.391
I was sure you'd like it.

73
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.268
From the looks of this cat...

74
00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:36.689
...I'd be prepared to say he's the type
that would stop at nothing to win.

75
00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:41.194
Absolutely. It's genius. People love
a rotten-to-the-core villain.

76
00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:46.074
Someone who will do the things
they only dream about in order to win!

77
00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:50.370
Remember, J.W., when in doubt,
always stoop as low as you can...

78
00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.872
...and appeal
to people's basest instincts.

79
00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:56.876
Gosh, thanks, Your Flashiness.
Right again.

80
00:13:57.127 --> 00:13:59.212
Well, our work here is done, ladies.

81
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.467
Go forth, J.W. Globwobbler,
and bringeth in the ratings!

82
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.765
Well, I guess there
are two slots available.

83
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:13.726
Boys, you're hired.

84
00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:16.354
Just sign on the dotted line, boys.

85
00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:20.275
This will be the greatest reality game
show in the history of TV.

86
00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:24.571
A show like this could make me
vice president of Hollywood.

87
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.295
These two are awful, sir.

88
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:43.256
Yep. It's perfect!

89
00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:47.135
And we're live!

90
00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:50.805
Well, hello, everybody out there
in television land...

91
00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.516
...and welcome to
The Fabulous Super Race.

92
00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:55.685
I'm Biff Buzzard.

93
00:14:55.895 --> 00:15:00.481
And I'm Buzz Blister. We're here
in beautiful Detroit, Michigan--

94
00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:07.030
We're here in gorgeous
Hollywood, California!

95
00:15:07.197 --> 00:15:09.991
That's right, Buzzer,
The Fabulous Super Race.

96
00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:14.203
It should be more exciting than
anything mankind has yet experienced...

97
00:15:14.413 --> 00:15:16.915
...in its brief time here
on planet Earth.

98
00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:19.500
And speaking of planet Earth, Biffster...

99
00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:22.545
...that's where our race is going
to take place.

100
00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:27.216
Right, Buzzatola. The race begins
here in Southern California...

101
00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:29.969
...and ends here in Mexico.

102
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:37.852
And this is the "keyako"
that opens the door to our terrific prize...

103
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.523
- ...a huge giant mansion.
- She's a beauty, Buzz.

104
00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:46.486
And she will go to the winner
of The Fabulous Super Race.

105
00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:51.366
Let's get down to the pits and
meet our contestants right now.

106
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:55.536
You must be...?

107
00:15:55.704 --> 00:15:57.830
Steed Dirkly at your service.

108
00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:03.336
And I'd like to say hello to all of my fans
rooting for me, Steed Dirkly.

109
00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:06.673
And might I just add
that all the proceeds I will win...

110
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.509
...will be donated
to my favorite charity.

111
00:16:09.843 --> 00:16:12.178
And what might that be, Steed?

112
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.347
Me.

113
00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:18.726
Well, I'm sure that warms the hearts
of America. Steed Dirkly...

114
00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:21.688
...a true hero with a heart of gold.
Good luck.

115
00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:25.692
Who have we got here, Buzz-A-Roo?

116
00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.861
Why, it looks like a cute old grandma.

117
00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:31.072
She Iooks just as cute and nice...

118
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.200
...and sweet and old
as she could be, doesn't she?

119
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.787
Why, thank you, sonny.

120
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:41.374
I'm one of those who believes
you're as young as you feel.

121
00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:47.255
I have always been a fan of good
clean fun and honest competition.

122
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:49.132
Huh.

123
00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:54.220
And who's this cute little fella?

124
00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.264
Ah!

125
00:16:56.515 --> 00:17:00.560
This is Squirty.
Oh, he's my whole world.

126
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:04.731
Squirty! Give the nice man
his finger back.

127
00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:14.282
Animals just don't like you, Biff.
You've got to remember that.

128
00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:18.327
Well, good luck, Grammy.
And good luck, Squirty.

129
00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:37.972
And what is your name, sir?

130
00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:41.142
I am Gorthan, Destroyer of Light.

131
00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:45.772
I am a little nervous.
I've never been on TV before.

132
00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:50.610
Really? Well, you're on TV now.
And where are you from, Mr. Destroyer?

133
00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:53.780
I'm guessing, from the outfit,
Oakland, California!

134
00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:58.618
I am from Niltor, near the outer alabaster
tower in the inner ring of green fire...

135
00:17:58.786 --> 00:18:02.330
...in the dimension of darkness
ruled by the overlords of dread.

136
00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:06.501
Ooh, nice. And what do you do in Niltor,
Mr. Destroyer?

137
00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:09.337
I own a flower shop
and a greeting-card store.

138
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.838
I see.

139
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.009
And I suppose you're looking
for a shot at that big cash prize...

140
00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:18.471
- ...and that fabulous mansion.
- Yes, that would be nice.

141
00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:21.516
One does grow weary
of the soul-crushing darkness...

142
00:18:21.683 --> 00:18:24.685
...and endless screaming
that fill the air of Niltor.

143
00:18:24.853 --> 00:18:27.355
Mr. Destroyer, I'm curious...

144
00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:31.859
...what exactly powers this
strange-looking vehicle of yours?

145
00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:36.364
It is powered by the anguish
of a thousand doomed souls.

146
00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:42.829
It sounds like he has a soft spot
in his heart for the environment, folks.

147
00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:46.415
Well, good luck, Gorthan,
Destroyer of Light.

148
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.334
Thank you, Biff.

149
00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:53.381
And you must be...?

150
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:56.884
Hi! I'm Mallory
from Watertown, Wisconsin.

151
00:18:57.052 --> 00:18:58.845
Everyone calls me Soccer Mom.

152
00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:03.391
Okay, Soccer Mom. And you're here in
your souped-up minivan, is that right?

153
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:06.519
Yeah. You know, between school
and soccer games...

154
00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:10.106
...and my online retail business,
I decided I needed a hobby.

155
00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:13.901
Fantastic, Soccer Mom.
Your kids must be very proud.

156
00:19:14.194 --> 00:19:18.948
Oh, yeah. Rufus, Gunter, Angus
and Shylock are all very proud.

157
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:21.367
All those boys must be a handful.

158
00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:26.080
No, Angus is a girl. Hi, kids!
Don't forget to water the sheep!

159
00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:30.084
Oh, and no swordplay in the house
while Mommy's gone, okay?

160
00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:35.590
Well, as the French say,
bueno el lucko to you, Soccer Mom.

161
00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:40.052
And that brings us to...?

162
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.388
I am Dr. Professor...

163
00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.765
...a super-resourceful genius.

164
00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:47.935
And I will no doubt be
the winner of this race.

165
00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:52.106
As we all know, science is golden.

166
00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:56.611
That looks like a pretty sophisticated
piece of machinery...

167
00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:59.071
- ...you have there, doctor.
- Yes, it is.

168
00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:03.784
And what kind of gas does it take?

169
00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:08.456
- Antimatter.
- Isn't that the most explosive...

170
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:11.751
...and powerful energy source
known to mankind?

171
00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:16.756
This is it. My own specially designed
antimatter engine. I never have to refuel.

172
00:20:16.924 --> 00:20:19.967
It uses the most efficient
and powerful fuel source.

173
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.679
So, what happens if this stuff
touches matter?

174
00:20:23.847 --> 00:20:26.974
It would instantly vaporize anything
in its vicinity.

175
00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.310
What's this little thingy here do?

176
00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.020
No! Don't touch that!

177
00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:38.778
That technology thing is certainly
moving fast, isn't it, Biff?

178
00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:40.363
Boy, I'll say.

179
00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:48.788
And here we have a pussycat
and a mouse.

180
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:52.500
Wow. I didn't realize that vermin
were eligible, Biff.

181
00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:56.796
And who on earth gave this pussycat
a driver's license?

182
00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:04.762
And what do you two have to say
to our viewers at home?

183
00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:11.185
Oh, that's right. They're animals, Biff,
and they can't talk.

184
00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:14.188
No, sir, but apparently they can drive.

185
00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:17.984
Hey! Look at this
little mouse-sized car.

186
00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:22.321
Aw, it's cute.

187
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:25.992
What can you get this baby up
to, Iittle mouse? Four?

188
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:30.913
- "Four."
- What's this little button here do?

189
00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:44.593
Ah!

190
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:55.521
Okay. Okay, folks. With that,
we are ready to get underway.

191
00:21:55.689 --> 00:22:01.736
And we'll see you all
at the finish line in Mexico.

192
00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:36.103
And there they go!

193
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.311
Attaboy, Squirty!

194
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.448
Our contestants are going to have
to employ the first of their vehicles'...

195
00:23:29.616 --> 00:23:34.453
...special modifications to get around
this notorious Southern California traffic.

196
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:40.126
And it looks like
they are doing just that, Biff.

197
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:13.033
Okay. I know just what to do now.

198
00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:53.699
Hey, what's that pussycat up to, Biff?

199
00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:56.619
No good it looks like to me, Buzz.

200
00:25:29.444 --> 00:25:33.614
- That was a close one, Buzz.
- That pussycat is dynamite!

201
00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:16.824
Well, it looks like pretty boy
is gaining, Squirty.

202
00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:34.508
Squirty! No! Bad dog!

203
00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:46.228
Oh, Squirty! No! Drop it! Drop it!

204
00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:44.703
This naughty pussycat would do well
in the pits of Niltor.

205
00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:49.041
Perhaps one of my stink pods will
give him a taste of his own medicine.

206
00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:13.399
It's a hit, sir!

207
00:28:13.608 --> 00:28:17.569
It's an ultra, super,
dynamic mega hit, Irving!

208
00:28:17.737 --> 00:28:19.780
We can't end this thing in Mexico!

209
00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:22.658
Call the crew, tell them
to move the finish line.

210
00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:24.618
To where, sir?

211
00:28:24.786 --> 00:28:28.747
Irving, which one of these shapes
is Mexico?

212
00:28:28.915 --> 00:28:32.084
- This one here, sir.
- Let's see...

213
00:28:32.335 --> 00:28:35.337
...how about if we take them to....

214
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:41.468
And here come the racers, Buzz!

215
00:29:02.657 --> 00:29:04.825
Hey, I won! Give me that key.

216
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:07.161
Not so fast.

217
00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:13.292
Oh. Was that a speed bump?

218
00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:19.339
Oh, heavenly days. Did I win?

219
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.312
Now, don't get too excited there, racers.

220
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.982
We've just received word
from our Hollywood studio...

221
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:41.528
...that due to high ratings, The Fabulous
Super Race is going to be extended.

222
00:29:41.696 --> 00:29:44.656
The next finish line
is located deep in the heart...

223
00:29:44.824 --> 00:29:49.661
- ...of the Amazon jungle.
- What? What are you talking about?

224
00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:51.497
Isn't that great?

225
00:30:33.706 --> 00:30:35.582
Hello again, folks.

226
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:40.963
Buzz Blister here in the heart of
the Amazon jungle with my cohost, Biff.

227
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.049
Our racers are forging
intrepidly ahead through...

228
00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:47.469
...this dense jungle on their way
to this very unstable...

229
00:30:47.637 --> 00:30:49.555
...and rickety-looking bridge.

230
00:30:49.722 --> 00:30:51.473
Here come our racers!

231
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:54.643
Oh, it looks like Steed Dirkly.

232
00:31:02.402 --> 00:31:04.778
Ooh, that was a close one, Buzz.

233
00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:07.406
Yes, it sure was, Biff.
And here comes--

234
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:09.074
Oh, it looks like Grammy.

235
00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:12.619
I hope she can negotiate the bridge
with those slats missing.

236
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:18.125
I'm right on your tail, pretty boy!

237
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:23.088
Oh, no! It looks like
Grammy's in trouble, Buzz!

238
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:27.175
It certainly does. And it's just too bad
that the rules prevent us...

239
00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:31.263
...from coming to the rescue
of that sweet, very old lady.

240
00:31:31.431 --> 00:31:34.266
No, that would be cheating, Buzz.

241
00:31:34.434 --> 00:31:39.021
So if this lady snaps through the rotten
wooden slats of this ancient bridge...

242
00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:43.650
...and falls to her doom,
we'll just have to go to a commercial.

243
00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:46.778
She just seems so helpless and delicate.

244
00:31:47.655 --> 00:31:51.158
So weak, so scrawny.

245
00:31:51.326 --> 00:31:53.619
So noodly and frothy.

246
00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:56.330
So crunchy and creamy.

247
00:31:56.664 --> 00:31:58.707
Pretty impressive.

248
00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:03.462
Hey! Looks like Gorthan, Destroyer of
Light, is making his crossing now.

249
00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:20.479
- Gorthan's in trouble, Biff!
- Wow, he sure is, Buzz!

250
00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:25.317
That heavy metal car of his may be
too much for that old bridge to handle.

251
00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:36.703
Knargack the Black-Winged...

252
00:32:36.871 --> 00:32:40.540
...I summon thee to appear
and use thine hideous powers...

253
00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:43.961
...to lifteth me-eth over
this obstacle-eth.

254
00:32:57.558 --> 00:33:00.769
Wow, Gorthan, that was some trick!

255
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:03.271
Did you train that bird yourself?

256
00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:07.192
Oh, no. Knargack's soul belongs
to that of a vanquished foe...

257
00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.778
...who's now trapped
and forced to serve.

258
00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:12.781
Can it talk? Could we get
an interview with it?

259
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:15.450
I have to get going.
I'm falling behind.

260
00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:20.539
Right. Well, good to see you again,
Gorthan, Destroyer of Light.

261
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.542
Thank you, Buzz.
Always great to see you.

262
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:29.297
I wouldn't have pegged him
as an animal lover.

263
00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:32.134
I wonder who will be next, Biff.

264
00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:56.575
That's funny. That doesn't look
like what's on my map, not at all.

265
00:33:56.743 --> 00:33:59.411
Oh, well, signs don't lie.

266
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:13.592
Oh, darn. I just had this washed.
I'd better call GoneStar.

267
00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:20.599
Hello. Thank you for calling GoneStar's
remote assistance department.

268
00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:23.518
My name is Dave.
Would you like to subscribe...

269
00:34:23.686 --> 00:34:27.522
- ...to our free music download offer?
- Oh, no, thank you, Dave.

270
00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.108
See, I have an emergency going on now.

271
00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:33.361
I see. Well, let me locate you
on my screen.

272
00:34:33.613 --> 00:34:36.782
You are Mallory MacDoogle,
a soccer mom.

273
00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:40.160
I have you pinpointed in a remote
and unexplored region...

274
00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:42.120
...of the Amazonian jungle.

275
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.665
- And what seems to be the trouble?
- See now, that's just it.

276
00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:49.503
I'm sinking in deadly quicksand
and I need help getting out now.

277
00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:51.838
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mallory.

278
00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:57.636
Just kidding. Well, let's consult
our GoneStar quicksand computer...

279
00:34:57.804 --> 00:35:00.305
...and see if we can't
get you out of there.

280
00:35:00.473 --> 00:35:02.808
Simply follow the prompts
on your screen.

281
00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:10.315
There are many types
of quicksand on our interesting planet.

282
00:35:10.483 --> 00:35:16.196
There is desert quicksand,
swamp quicksand and jungle quicksand.

283
00:35:18.157 --> 00:35:20.700
You have selected jungle quicksand.

284
00:35:21.035 --> 00:35:23.537
Now please choose
the jungle you are in.

285
00:35:23.704 --> 00:35:27.541
Are you in A, the Belgian Congo...

286
00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:33.421
...B, a Southeast Asian jungle
or C, the Amazonian jungle?

287
00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:35.173
Amazonian, yeah.

288
00:35:35.341 --> 00:35:39.719
Now choose what you would like to do
with the quicksand you have selected.

289
00:35:40.012 --> 00:35:46.393
Would you like to A, make quicksand,
B, garden with quicksand...

290
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:49.938
...or C, get out of quicksand?

291
00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:52.274
Oh, phooey.

292
00:35:54.193 --> 00:35:56.570
To get out, press--

293
00:36:04.871 --> 00:36:07.372
Wait a ding-dang minute here.

294
00:36:07.707 --> 00:36:11.084
You know, I think somebody
might've done this on purpose.

295
00:36:12.378 --> 00:36:16.882
Oh, no, don't go that way, little mouse.
The race is this way, yeah!

296
00:36:17.049 --> 00:36:19.926
My van sank in the quicksand,
so I guess I'm out.

297
00:36:20.261 --> 00:36:24.598
Here, have an orange.
It will give you energy.

298
00:36:24.932 --> 00:36:26.808
Good luck!

299
00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:40.614
- Too bad about Soccer Mom, Buzz.
- Yes, I was kind of rooting for her.

300
00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:55.086
But what's this?
That crazy pussycat...

301
00:36:55.254 --> 00:36:58.590
...has stopped at the end of the bridge.
He's got a saw.

302
00:36:58.758 --> 00:37:01.968
I sense a dirty trick coming up.

303
00:37:29.956 --> 00:37:33.792
Ooh, looks like that one backfired
on the pussycat.

304
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.961
It sure does, Buzzalito.

305
00:37:36.128 --> 00:37:41.549
And this river is infested with
pussycat-eating piranha fish.

306
00:37:45.805 --> 00:37:50.809
- That's Tierra del Fuego, sir.
- And that?

307
00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:53.019
That would be the Antarctic, sir.

308
00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:54.646
Fantastic!

309
00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:59.567
The racers will have to modify their cars
and sail across water to make it there.

310
00:38:00.027 --> 00:38:03.655
That should boost the ratings
even higher!

311
00:38:04.198 --> 00:38:08.660
Folks, I've just heard from Hollywood
and have received some terrific news...

312
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:11.997
...that I'm sure our racers
will be pleased to hear!

313
00:38:12.164 --> 00:38:16.251
Our racers are now going to head for
the southernmost tip of South America...

314
00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:19.546
...where they will prepare
for the difficult crossing...

315
00:38:19.714 --> 00:38:22.340
...from Cape Horn to the Antarctic.

316
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:27.304
And won't our racers be excited
and happy to hear that!

317
00:38:27.888 --> 00:38:30.223
And here they come!

318
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:35.895
- Give me that key!
- Oh, ho, ho. Not so fast, Steed.

319
00:38:36.063 --> 00:38:38.523
Biff has some news for you all!

320
00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:41.401
That's right, all. The race
has been extended.

321
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:46.906
And we will see each and all of you
in the Antarctic! Good luck, everyone!

322
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:03.256
Avast, Squirty!

323
00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:08.053
It'll take more than a little drizzle
to keep us from winning. Arr!

324
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:15.101
Ah, this reminds me of sailing
Blood Blister Bay back in Niltor. Ew!

325
00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:34.913
No, this is terrible. Stop sinking!

326
00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:44.798
Well, maybe this isn't so bad after all.

327
00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:52.472
Well, Miss Mermaid...

328
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:58.144
...you are in Iuck. Because Steed Dirkly
has just washed upon your shore.

329
00:39:58.312 --> 00:40:01.856
And as soon as you dry
these damp clothes, I'll reward you...

330
00:40:02.024 --> 00:40:03.983
...by letting you fix my dinner.

331
00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:09.280
Arrgh!

332
00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:15.954
Hey, this just in, Biffo.

333
00:40:16.122 --> 00:40:19.290
Oh, some disappointing news
from the Southern Atlantic.

334
00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:23.711
It seems Steed Dirkly is being parboiled
in a briny bouillabaisse...

335
00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.798
...and served
with a caper dill cream mousseline.

336
00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:31.845
Ooh, Buzzby, he's out of the race.
But he sounds delicious.

337
00:40:39.019 --> 00:40:45.191
Well, Gorthan, congratulations on being
the first one to make it to the Antarctic.

338
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:47.152
Thank you, Buzz. And hello, Biff.

339
00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:49.821
Say, Gorthan, have you ever heard
that thing...

340
00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:54.325
...about sticking your tongue
on a piece of frozen metal?

341
00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:56.077
No. What do you mean?

342
00:40:56.245 --> 00:40:59.164
Well, Gorthan, they say
if you touch your tongue...

343
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:02.667
...on a frozen piece of metal,
it will stick.

344
00:41:03.169 --> 00:41:05.920
- What?
- Yes. What do you think, Gorthan?

345
00:41:06.088 --> 00:41:07.672
Will it stick, yes or no?

346
00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:11.676
Well, no, that's nonsense.
The answer is no. It wouldn't stick.

347
00:41:11.844 --> 00:41:15.930
Well, what about putting your money
where your mouth is, Gorthan?

348
00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:19.601
- What do you mean?
- Well, we have the South Pole right here.

349
00:41:19.768 --> 00:41:21.019
Why not give it a try?

350
00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:24.689
What? You mean, stick my tongue
on this stupid metal pole here?

351
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.944
Who would have thought that
the so-called Destroyer of Light...

352
00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:34.199
- ...was really just a big wimp.
- Look, I'm warning you!

353
00:41:34.366 --> 00:41:39.287
No need to resort to evil magic, Gorthan.
If you think your tongue won't stick...

354
00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.080
...just go ahead and show us.

355
00:41:41.248 --> 00:41:46.794
Oh, all right. If only to prove
to you mortals that you are wrong! Here.

356
00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:49.214
Well, go on, Gorthan.

357
00:41:49.381 --> 00:41:51.883
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

358
00:41:52.718 --> 00:41:54.886
There. You see? I told you.

359
00:41:59.225 --> 00:42:02.393
- Told you.
- I knew it.

360
00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:05.230
Hey, Buzz, look.

361
00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:07.106
The ice is cracking.

362
00:42:07.274 --> 00:42:11.819
Gosh, you're right, Biff-O-Rama.
Let's hop over to safety.

363
00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:16.324
Hey, what about me? Come on, fellas.

364
00:42:18.744 --> 00:42:21.579
And it looks like Gorthan
is out of the race.

365
00:42:21.747 --> 00:42:23.456
It sure does, Buzzo.

366
00:42:23.624 --> 00:42:27.460
But at least we proved once and for all
that your tongue will stick...

367
00:42:27.628 --> 00:42:31.923
- ...to a metal pole if it's cold enough.
- And that's something.

368
00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:35.927
I curse your souls, mortals!

369
00:42:37.638 --> 00:42:41.015
Boy, somebody sure is a sore loser.

370
00:42:41.183 --> 00:42:45.436
That leaves the pussycat, the mouse
and, of course, Grammy.

371
00:42:45.604 --> 00:42:47.188
Yes. And here they are.

372
00:42:50.317 --> 00:42:52.819
Let's have a word with Grammy.

373
00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:55.780
Say, Grammy,
I'm sure the folks at home...

374
00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:59.450
...would like to know how you feel
about the race thus far.

375
00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:03.288
Well, it's a wonderful competition.

376
00:43:03.455 --> 00:43:06.124
It's good for a person to participate...

377
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:10.461
...in old-fashioned, clean,
wholesome fun!

378
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:35.320
Ah!

379
00:43:51.545 --> 00:43:54.005
Squirty. Squirty!

380
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:57.133
Grammy's coming!

381
00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.011
Mr. Pussycat...

382
00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:04.557
...how are you going to sleep at night
after a rotten trick like that?

383
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:11.731
I think he'll sleep just fine, Buzz.

384
00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:15.360
Looks like the pussycat is in the lead.

385
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:23.201
Well, it seems we are down
to only two competitors now, Biffy.

386
00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:25.536
That's right. A cat and a mouse.

387
00:44:25.704 --> 00:44:27.413
A predator and the prey.

388
00:44:27.581 --> 00:44:31.376
- The overdog and the underdog.
- The eater and the eaten.

389
00:44:31.543 --> 00:44:36.255
- The big and the small.
- Okay, Biff, I think we get the idea.

390
00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:42.822
Ah!

391
00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:07.013
Just take a look at the ratings
for the show, sir.

392
00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:09.682
Holy cow, they're through the roof!

393
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:14.020
If this doesn't make me vice president
of Hollywood, I don't know what will.

394
00:46:14.188 --> 00:46:15.396
We gotta keep this up.

395
00:46:15.564 --> 00:46:18.816
What can we do to make the show
more exciting? Where are they?

396
00:46:18.984 --> 00:46:22.528
They're racing across the Antarctic.
The next stop is Australia.

397
00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:27.074
Australia, huh?
Isn't that where Mozart is from?

398
00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.826
No. That's Austria, sir.

399
00:46:28.994 --> 00:46:32.330
Oh, right. So how should we
have them get there?

400
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:35.500
Well, standard procedure
is to fly or sail, sir.

401
00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:39.003
You gotta learn how to think
out of the box, Irving.

402
00:46:39.171 --> 00:46:43.257
But how else would they get there?
There's an enormous body of water...

403
00:46:43.425 --> 00:46:47.011
- ...between the Antarctic and Australia.
- Precisely.

404
00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:51.015
- You mean...?
- Yes, keep going.

405
00:46:52.392 --> 00:46:55.019
- Underwater, sir?
- Bingo!

406
00:46:55.187 --> 00:46:58.731
That's the kind of thinking
that will keep you out of the mailroom.

407
00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:04.278
The leg of the race between Antarctica
and Australia will be held underwater.

408
00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:06.239
It'll be a television first.

409
00:47:06.406 --> 00:47:10.034
Let's just see how high
we can get these ratings to go.

410
00:48:26.486 --> 00:48:30.823
Well, I see the mouse, Buzz,
but no sign of the pussyc-- Wait!

411
00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:35.119
His car is there, but the pussycat
is not in the vehicle.

412
00:48:35.287 --> 00:48:41.167
As we all know, the contestant must be
in his vehicle in order to stay in the race.

413
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:47.131
Congratulations, Mr. Mouse!
You have taken the lead.

414
00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:51.677
You're that much closer
to owning your very own mansion.

415
00:48:51.845 --> 00:48:54.055
Now it's time to modify your vehicle...

416
00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:58.643
...because the next leg of the race
to Australia is taking place.

417
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.728
Underwater.

418
00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:17.912
Ooh, tough break for the pussycat.

419
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.833
Yes, cats don't like water at all.
Especially this one.

420
00:52:27.686 --> 00:52:30.771
Mr. Globwobbler, sir,
the pussycat is out of the race.

421
00:52:30.939 --> 00:52:35.192
I love that cat. That backstabbing
feline drove our ratings through the roof.

422
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.572
- Get him back in the race!
- Yes, sir.

423
00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:54.086
Take it easy, Punchy. Oh, we're on.

424
00:52:54.254 --> 00:52:58.048
Oh. Gee'day all you mates and sheilas.
We're here--

425
00:52:58.216 --> 00:53:00.718
Biff, no, it's "g'day."

426
00:53:00.886 --> 00:53:03.137
Like, duh, you pronounce
the "guh" sound.

427
00:53:03.305 --> 00:53:05.472
Guh, duh, juh, guh, uh.

428
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:09.226
Well, now I'm all self-conscious
and it sounds weird to me.

429
00:53:09.394 --> 00:53:11.061
I think you better do it.

430
00:53:11.229 --> 00:53:13.439
All right. Then here, you take Punchy.

431
00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:17.985
I don't think this kangaroo
likes me very much, Buzz.

432
00:53:18.236 --> 00:53:20.905
Nonsense. Take the leash.
G'day, folks.

433
00:53:21.072 --> 00:53:27.286
We're here down under in beautiful, hot,
humid, bug-infested Australia.

434
00:53:27.454 --> 00:53:32.416
And, folks, say hello to our Australian
ambassador of good will, Punchy...

435
00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:36.086
...the boxing kangaroo.
Isn't he cute, folks?

436
00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:38.672
He's adorable. Juh'day.

437
00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:44.136
The next portion of the race
will take place in the rugged outback.

438
00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:45.679
Isn't that right, Biff?

439
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.604
Then on north up to Weipa
in the northernmost portion of Australia.

440
00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:57.024
The next leg of our race is about
to begin. Here they come!

441
00:54:02.447 --> 00:54:04.323
It looks like Grammy.

442
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:05.824
Yes. And that's amazing.

443
00:54:05.992 --> 00:54:09.662
Because the last time we saw her,
she had been eaten by a whale.

444
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:11.997
Never underestimate the elderly, Buzz.

445
00:54:12.165 --> 00:54:13.958
Especially Grammy.

446
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:18.545
No, sir. This old bat
is full of surprises.

447
00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:23.759
Hey, it's the mouse.

448
00:54:28.473 --> 00:54:31.308
Any sign of the pussycat,
Mr. Mouse?

449
00:54:32.477 --> 00:54:34.979
I think it's curtains
for the pussycat, Buzz.

450
00:54:35.146 --> 00:54:39.984
And that's too bad. His rotten attitude
was making this race so exciting.

451
00:54:40.151 --> 00:54:42.319
Well, good luck, rodent.

452
00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.839
Oh, my little spud! I love you!

453
00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:04.341
Let's burn rubber, Squirty!

454
00:55:13.226 --> 00:55:15.602
Wait a minute, Biff, what's that?

455
00:55:27.198 --> 00:55:33.037
Well, Biff, it looks like the network
has taken a liking to a certain pussycat.

456
00:55:33.204 --> 00:55:35.247
Why bother? He can't win.

457
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:39.460
Grammy and the rodent
are already halfway across Australia.

458
00:55:39.627 --> 00:55:43.547
Yes. I think we can stick a fork
in the pussycat, because he's toast.

459
00:55:43.715 --> 00:55:45.549
And so is his car.

460
00:55:55.894 --> 00:55:59.605
Well, it's always encouraging
to see a guy who won't give up.

461
00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:01.899
Yes. But this case is hopeless.

462
00:56:02.067 --> 00:56:05.402
There's no way the pussycat
will be able to make up the gap...

463
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:07.571
...between the mouse and Grammy.

464
00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:13.660
Yes. He'd pretty much have to saw
the entire continent of Australia in half.

465
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:16.747
And that's extremely unlikely.

466
00:56:16.915 --> 00:56:19.500
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

467
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.838
No! He's not gonna--

468
00:56:25.006 --> 00:56:31.095
He sure is gonna. That crazy pussycat
is going to saw Australia in half.

469
00:56:31.262 --> 00:56:35.974
- How about that, folks?
- That's some determined pussycat.

470
00:56:36.184 --> 00:56:39.144
I'll say, Biff. We'd better get off
this continent...

471
00:56:39.312 --> 00:56:42.523
...before it sinks to the bottom
of Davy Jones' Locker.

472
00:57:03.628 --> 00:57:07.548
Oh, you rotten, dirty pussycat.

473
00:57:55.263 --> 00:57:58.849
Well, it serves you right,
you naughty pussycat.

474
00:58:00.768 --> 00:58:01.894
Ah!

475
00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:00.661
Wahoo!

476
00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:15.300
Ooh!

477
00:59:16.135 --> 00:59:19.596
We're going down, Squirty.
Quick, the parachutes!

478
00:59:29.357 --> 00:59:32.025
Why, you ungrateful little stinker.

479
00:59:32.193 --> 00:59:35.696
If it weren't for me,
you'd still be at the animal-testing lab...

480
00:59:35.863 --> 00:59:39.825
...having antiperspirant sprayed
in your eyes and drinking paint.

481
00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:49.793
Geronimo!

482
00:59:50.962 --> 00:59:52.379
Ooh!

483
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:56.300
Open the chute, Squirty.
Open the chute!

484
00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:01.346
Oh, Squirty, I can't....

485
01:00:24.495 --> 01:00:26.538
Ah!

486
01:00:58.196 --> 01:01:01.365
Sir, Grammy is out of the race.
The pussycat did her in.

487
01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:05.911
- It's just him and the mouse now.
- This whole caper is falling apart.

488
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.872
Listen up, Irving.
This race is taking too long.

489
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:12.709
The public have the attention span
of a cocker spaniel.

490
01:01:12.877 --> 01:01:18.674
You'd better speed up the last leg of
the race or your sorry butt goes bye-bye.

491
01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:24.304
But we told the public this race would go
through the greatest cities in the world.

492
01:01:24.472 --> 01:01:27.140
And we haven't even been
to Cleveland yet.

493
01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:30.435
Irving, the public doesn't want
a bunch of pretty cities.

494
01:01:30.603 --> 01:01:34.439
They want action.
Action and plenty of explosions.

495
01:01:34.607 --> 01:01:37.943
Now, I want this race wrapped up
in five minutes, Irving...

496
01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:42.406
- ...or you'll find yourself sorting mail.
- Yes, sir.

497
01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:52.999
Well, it looks like the lower life forms
have taken the lead.

498
01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:56.086
That's right, Buzz-Buzz,
and just as well.

499
01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:59.131
I think they've done something
for the self-esteem...

500
01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:01.299
...of fur-covered animals everywhere.

501
01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:23.321
Tom and Jerry, as the only
surviving drivers in our Super Race...

502
01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:29.953
...we're giving you two nuclear-powered,
rocket-car, jet-plane, hovercraft things.

503
01:02:32.665 --> 01:02:35.959
And there's a teensy change in plans.

504
01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:38.795
You've only got five minutes
to finish the race!

505
01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:44.885
That's right.
Once you racers leave Borneo...

506
01:02:45.052 --> 01:02:50.891
...you'll cross Europe and the
Atlantic Ocean to the good old U.S. of A.

507
01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:56.313
There you'll cross the continent to reach
the finish line in Hollywood, California...

508
01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.565
...in five minutes!

509
01:03:14.707 --> 01:03:18.877
So good luck.
And may the best lower species win.

510
01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:42.854
Hm?

511
01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:25.397
Biffette, we're here at the finish Iine,
where the crowd waits anxiously...

512
01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:28.692
...to see if the winner
will be the cat or the mouse.

513
01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:52.048
Holy smokes, folks.

514
01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:54.634
We can hear them heading
right this way.

515
01:06:54.885 --> 01:06:57.095
They're neck and neck.
Isn't that right, Biff?

516
01:06:58.597 --> 01:06:59.931
That's right.

517
01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:03.977
I too can hardly speak anything articulate
with all this excitement.

518
01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:09.065
At those speeds, how long do you think
it'll take them to reach the finish line?

519
01:07:11.068 --> 01:07:16.239
I'm with you. It's hard to form even
a simple sentence with this excitement.

520
01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:20.285
But who will win? The cat or the mouse?
Feline or rodent? Pet or pest?

521
01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:24.748
The couch-scratcher
or the cheese-nibbler? Who, Biff, who?

522
01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:46.478
And here they come, folks. What
an incredible final lap. Right, Biffaroni?

523
01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:12.962
And they're a mere 5 feet from
the finish line. And in the lead is Tom.

524
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:15.965
No, Jerry. No, Tom. No, Jerry!

525
01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:19.969
Tom. Jerry. Tom. Jerry.

526
01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:22.639
Tom! Jer--

527
01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:26.476
T! J! Tuh! Juh!

528
01:08:32.983 --> 01:08:35.693
It's a tie!

529
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.540
Congratulations, boys.
I've got good news and bad news.

530
01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:52.710
The good news is, you just finished
the most spectacular race in history.

531
01:08:53.254 --> 01:08:57.006
The bad news is, it's a tie.

532
01:08:57.174 --> 01:09:00.844
And your contract says
you'll both have to do the race...

533
01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.513
...all over again.

534
01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:08.226
Huh?

535
01:09:41.927 --> 01:09:43.261
Ugh.

536
01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:49.434
From now on, Hollywood is going
to stand for morality, wholesomeness...

537
01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:53.313
...good, clean, family entertainment.

538
01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:56.065
What's gotten into him?

539
01:09:56.275 --> 01:10:00.320
We can't have that kind of attitude
in Hollywood.

540
01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:07.243
Well, today is your lucky day, Irving.

541
01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:12.165
Or should I say new head
of Globwobbler Studios!

542
01:10:13.959 --> 01:10:17.754
Gosh. Head of Globwobbler Studios.

543
01:10:40.277 --> 01:10:43.488
Well, how nice of you
to get me a new home...

544
01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:47.325
...since you wrecked my old one.
And while we're--

545
01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:51.663
Tom, there's that mouse again.
Get that mouse out of our house!

546
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:57.835
Well, don't just stand there,
do something! Get going! Go on, hurry!

547
01:10:58.003 --> 01:11:00.672
Get that mouse out!
