00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:48.062
On Christmas Eve,
many years ago...

2
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.690
I lay quietly in my bed.

3
00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:53.193
I did not rustle the sheets.

4
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.654
I breathed slowly and silently.

5
00:00:56.822 --> 00:01:02.535
I was listening for a sound I
was afraid I'd never hear.

6
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.999
The ringing bells
of Santa's sleigh.

7
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:39.632
All right. All right,
Sarah, you had your water.

8
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.843
Now let's get you
upstairs and into bed.

9
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:44.637
But... But... But, I have to...

10
00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:50.101
He said Santa would have to
fly faster than light...

11
00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.105
to get to every house in one night.
And to hold everyone's presents...

12
00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:56.983
his sled would be bigger
than an ocean liner.

13
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:01.154
Your brother said that? He was just
kidding you. He knows there's a Santa.

14
00:03:01.322 --> 00:03:04.991
He said he wasn't sure. He wasn't
sure if Santa was for real.

15
00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.202
Of course Santa is real.
He's as real as Christmas itself.

16
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.998
But he won't come until you're
sound asleep, young lady.

17
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.834
Sweet dreams.

18
00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:18.004
Santa will be here
before you know it.

19
00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:20.173
So go to sleep.

20
00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:07.053
"Stark, barren."

21
00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:12.767
"Devoid of life."

22
00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.947
He's gotta be asleep by now.

23
00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:30.159
He used to stay awake all
night waiting for Santa.

24
00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:33.913
Think those days are
just about over.

25
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.999
That would be sad
if that were true.

26
00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:39.669
Yeah, an end of the magic.

27
00:04:41.088 --> 00:04:43.423
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

28
00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.640
See, he's out like a light.

29
00:04:52.808 --> 00:04:55.977
An express train wouldn't
wake him up now.

30
00:04:59.273 --> 00:05:01.691
"End of the magic"?

31
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:21.240
All aboard!

32
00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:54.614
Well? You coming?

33
00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:57.116
Where?

34
00:07:57.284 --> 00:07:59.452
Why, to the North
Pole, of course.

35
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.456
This is the Polar Express.

36
00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:06.125
The North Pole?

37
00:08:07.628 --> 00:08:09.253
I see.

38
00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:10.796
Hold this, please.

39
00:08:10.964 --> 00:08:12.924
Thank you.

40
00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:15.551
Is this you?

41
00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:19.180
- Yeah.
- Well, it says here...

42
00:08:19.348 --> 00:08:24.018
no photo with a department-store
Santa this year, no letter to Santa.

43
00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:27.855
And you made your sister put
out the milk and cookies.

44
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.691
Sounds to me like this
is your crucial year.

45
00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:35.238
If I were you, I would think
about climbing on board.

46
00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:42.495
Come on, come on.
I've got a schedule to keep.

47
00:08:45.207 --> 00:08:47.541
Suit yourself.

48
00:09:47.894 --> 00:09:51.564
'Cause that's the way things
happen On the Polar Express.

49
00:09:51.732 --> 00:09:54.734
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing.

50
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:58.154
Ding, ding, the bell will
ring Golly, look at her go.

51
00:09:58.322 --> 00:10:01.741
You wonder if we'll get
there soon Anybody's guess.

52
00:10:01.908 --> 00:10:05.161
'Cause that's the way things
happen On the Polar Express.

53
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:08.914
When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"

54
00:10:09.082 --> 00:10:11.334
We'll arrive with A
bang, bang, bang.

55
00:10:11.501 --> 00:10:13.753
Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way.

56
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.089
With a comfy seat and lots to
eat Boy, it's just the best.

57
00:10:17.257 --> 00:10:20.468
Wish it wouldn't
ever have to end.

58
00:10:20.635 --> 00:10:23.429
With a little luck, we'll be on
time There's no need to stress.

59
00:10:23.597 --> 00:10:28.100
'Cause that's the way things
happen On the Polar Express.

60
00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:34.607
Hey. Hey, you. Yeah, you. Do you
know what kind of train this is?

61
00:10:36.401 --> 00:10:39.278
Train. Do you know what kind
of train this is? Do you?

62
00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:42.782
Of course.

63
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:45.117
It's a magic train.

64
00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:48.579
- We're going to the North Pole.
- I know it's a magic train.

65
00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:51.332
It's a Baldwin 2-8-4
Sá-class steam locomotive...

66
00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:56.420
built in 1931 at the Baldwin Locomotive
Works. It weighs 456,100 pounds and...

67
00:10:56.588 --> 00:10:58.798
Are we really going
to the North Pole?

68
00:10:59.383 --> 00:11:01.300
- Hey, look!
- Isn't that wonderful?

69
00:11:01.468 --> 00:11:05.096
Herpolsheimer's!
Herpolsheimer's!

70
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.853
Wow, look at all those presents.
I want all of them.

71
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:17.108
It's so Christmassy and
cozy and beautiful!

72
00:11:23.198 --> 00:11:24.532
Tickets.

73
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:27.118
Tickets, please.

74
00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:28.869
Tickets.

75
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.290
Ticket, please.

76
00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:35.835
Try your pocket.

77
00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:44.844
Try your other pocket.

78
00:12:01.945 --> 00:12:03.529
Thank you, sir.

79
00:12:13.748 --> 00:12:15.124
Hey, watch out, there.

80
00:12:15.292 --> 00:12:16.959
Thank you, sir.

81
00:12:18.211 --> 00:12:21.338
That is a public-address
microphone. It is not a toy.

82
00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:23.591
Boy, that guy sure
likes to show off.

83
00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:26.552
Look what that wise guy
punched on my ticket.

84
00:12:26.887 --> 00:12:32.558
"L-E." What the heck does that mean?
- Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

85
00:12:33.768 --> 00:12:36.270
We're heading for the
other side of the tracks.

86
00:12:53.121 --> 00:12:54.997
Well? You coming?

87
00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:56.916
It's just another pickup.

88
00:12:57.083 --> 00:13:00.544
That's weird. I thought you were
supposed to be the last one.

89
00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:02.922
Why, to the North
Pole, of course.

90
00:13:03.089 --> 00:13:05.925
This is the Polar Express.

91
00:13:09.137 --> 00:13:11.096
Suit yourself.

92
00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:43.212
Hey, that kid wants
to get on the train.

93
00:13:44.005 --> 00:13:46.131
Come on!

94
00:13:48.343 --> 00:13:50.135
Hurry up!

95
00:13:56.518 --> 00:13:57.977
We have to stop the train.

96
00:13:58.144 --> 00:14:00.646
- I don't know how.
- Pull the emergency brake!

97
00:14:30.635 --> 00:14:33.512
Who in the blazes applied
that emergency brake?!

98
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.097
He did.

99
00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:37.016
You.

100
00:14:37.517 --> 00:14:42.354
In case you didn't know, that cord
is for emergency purposes only.

101
00:14:42.856 --> 00:14:47.276
And in case you weren't aware,
tonight is Christmas Eve.

102
00:14:47.444 --> 00:14:51.530
And in case you hadn't noticed, this
train is on a very tight schedule.

103
00:14:51.698 --> 00:14:55.659
Now, young man, Christmas may not
be important to some people...

104
00:14:55.827 --> 00:14:59.288
but it is very important
to the rest of us!

105
00:14:59.456 --> 00:15:00.956
But... But...

106
00:15:01.124 --> 00:15:04.710
He was just trying to stop the
train so that kid could get on.

107
00:15:07.088 --> 00:15:10.382
I see. Young man, is
that what happened?

108
00:15:14.888 --> 00:15:16.847
Well...

109
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.809
Let me remind you we are
on a very tight schedule.

110
00:15:20.977 --> 00:15:23.228
And I've never been
late before...

111
00:15:23.396 --> 00:15:26.148
and I am certainly not
going to be late tonight.

112
00:15:26.316 --> 00:15:30.319
Now, everybody, take
your seats, please!

113
00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.407
Thank you.

114
00:15:39.245 --> 00:15:40.746
Your attention, please.

115
00:15:40.914 --> 00:15:45.417
Are there any Polar Express
passengers in need of refreshment?

116
00:15:45.585 --> 00:15:48.545
- Me! Me! Me!
- I thought so.

117
00:15:57.097 --> 00:15:58.597
- Hot, hot.
- Oh, we got it.

118
00:15:58.765 --> 00:16:00.724
- Hot, hot.
- Hey, we got it.

119
00:16:00.892 --> 00:16:03.644
- Hot, hot.
- Say, we got it.

120
00:16:03.812 --> 00:16:05.104
Hot chocolate Hot, hot.

121
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:07.022
- Oh, we got it.

122
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.941
- So we got it.
- Hot, hot.

123
00:16:09.109 --> 00:16:11.402
Yo, we got it.

124
00:16:11.569 --> 00:16:14.113
- Hot chocolate.
- Here we've only got one rule.

125
00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.156
Never, ever let it cool.

126
00:16:16.324 --> 00:16:17.991
Keep it cooking in the pot.

127
00:16:18.159 --> 00:16:20.953
- Then you got.
- Hot chocolate.

128
00:16:25.792 --> 00:16:27.793
- Hot, hot.
- Oh, we got it.

129
00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:29.336
- Hot, hot.
- Hey, we got it.

130
00:16:29.504 --> 00:16:31.797
- Hot, hot.
- Say, we got it.

131
00:16:32.632 --> 00:16:33.882
Hot chocolate Hot, hot.

132
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.801
- Oh, we got it.

133
00:16:35.969 --> 00:16:37.761
- So we got it.
- Hot, hot.

134
00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:40.055
Yo, we got it.

135
00:16:40.223 --> 00:16:42.808
- Hot chocolate.
- Here we only got one rule.

136
00:16:42.976 --> 00:16:44.643
Here we only got one rule.

137
00:16:44.894 --> 00:16:48.647
Never, ever let it cool.

138
00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:50.566
Keep it cooking in the pot.

139
00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:53.777
Soon you got hot chocolate.

140
00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:56.238
- Hot, hot.
- Hey, we got it.

141
00:16:56.406 --> 00:16:58.157
- Hot, hot.
- Oh, we got it.

142
00:16:58.324 --> 00:17:00.117
- Hot, hot.
- Yeah, we got it.

143
00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:01.952
- Hot, hot.
- Oh, we got it.

144
00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.829
- Hot, hot.
- Yeah, we got it.

145
00:17:05.206 --> 00:17:06.623
- Oh, we got it.
- Hot, hot.

146
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:09.001
Yeah, we got it.

147
00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:27.436
You know, Montezuma, the
king of the Aztecs...

148
00:17:27.604 --> 00:17:31.190
would drink 50 quarts of
hot chocolate every day.

149
00:17:31.357 --> 00:17:35.027
It was thick as mud and red. He put
chili pepper in instead of sugar.

150
00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:38.572
- Get it? Hot chocolate?
- How do you know? That's not true.

151
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.533
- Where you going with that?
- It's for him.

152
00:17:41.701 --> 00:17:46.079
- I don't think we're to leave our seats.
- It's a violation of safety regulations...

153
00:17:46.247 --> 00:17:49.374
for a kid to cross moving
cars without a grown-up.

154
00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:51.126
I think I'll be okay.

155
00:17:51.294 --> 00:17:53.712
Are you sure?

156
00:18:02.555 --> 00:18:06.683
What about this lad in the back?
Did he get any refreshment?

157
00:18:08.645 --> 00:18:10.896
Well, let's take some
to him, by all means.

158
00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:17.444
Watch your step, now.
Watch your step.

159
00:18:21.074 --> 00:18:22.574
She forgot her ticket.

160
00:18:22.742 --> 00:18:25.118
It hasn't been punched.

161
00:18:26.454 --> 00:18:29.122
What are you doing?
You're gonna get us in trouble!

162
00:21:00.358 --> 00:21:03.235
Young lady, forgive me.

163
00:21:03.403 --> 00:21:06.947
I believe I have neglected
to punch your ticket.

164
00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:08.949
May I?

165
00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.912
I left my ticket right
here on the seat.

166
00:21:14.497 --> 00:21:16.415
- But it's gone.
- You mean...

167
00:21:16.916 --> 00:21:18.834
you have lost your ticket.

168
00:21:19.002 --> 00:21:20.919
She didn't lose her ticket.

169
00:21:22.046 --> 00:21:23.880
I did.

170
00:21:24.507 --> 00:21:27.592
I was trying to
return it to you.

171
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.595
But the wind blew
it out of my hand.

172
00:21:34.225 --> 00:21:35.475
You can have my ticket.

173
00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:43.775
These tickets are
not transferable.

174
00:21:44.527 --> 00:21:45.777
Young lady...

175
00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:49.031
you will just have to
come along with me.

176
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:02.502
You know what's gonna happen now?
He's gonna throw her off the train.

177
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.630
He's gonna probably throw
her off the rear platform.

178
00:22:05.798 --> 00:22:09.342
Standard procedure. That way, she
won't get sucked under the wheels.

179
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.763
They may slow the train down, but
they're never gonna stop it.

180
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.139
Stop it?

181
00:22:14.307 --> 00:22:17.142
That's it! I have to
stop the train again.

182
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.561
No, please, don't do that again.

183
00:22:51.052 --> 00:22:52.803
Where'd they go?

184
00:22:53.221 --> 00:22:54.888
What happened to them?

185
00:22:55.056 --> 00:22:58.016
Please, she's in big trouble.
You have to help me.

186
00:23:35.638 --> 00:23:42.227
Hey!

187
00:23:42.395 --> 00:23:46.106
I found your ticket! Wait!

188
00:23:48.568 --> 00:23:50.068
Hey!

189
00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:52.571
Wait!

190
00:23:52.738 --> 00:23:55.157
I have your ticket!

191
00:24:31.527 --> 00:24:33.445
Is there something
I can do for you?

192
00:24:33.613 --> 00:24:35.614
I'm looking for a girl.

193
00:24:36.324 --> 00:24:37.824
A gi...?

194
00:24:43.247 --> 00:24:45.207
Ain't we all?

195
00:24:46.125 --> 00:24:47.876
I have her ticket.

196
00:24:48.044 --> 00:24:51.546
Well, lookie. Lookie here.
What is this?

197
00:24:51.714 --> 00:24:56.301
This is an official, authentic,
genuine ticket to ride.

198
00:24:56.469 --> 00:24:59.971
You better keep this in a
safe place, young man.

199
00:25:00.139 --> 00:25:01.556
If I was you...

200
00:25:01.724 --> 00:25:04.392
I keep all my
valuables right here.

201
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.728
Right here in the old size 13.

202
00:25:06.896 --> 00:25:09.147
Experience shows this
is the safest place.

203
00:25:10.524 --> 00:25:12.651
Not that I have
much use for those.

204
00:25:12.818 --> 00:25:14.069
Tickets.

205
00:25:14.237 --> 00:25:15.820
I ride for free.

206
00:25:15.988 --> 00:25:20.825
Oh, yeah, yeah. I hop aboard this
rattler any time I feels like it.

207
00:25:20.993 --> 00:25:23.036
I own this train. Oh, yeah.

208
00:25:23.204 --> 00:25:27.666
It's like I'm the king of this
train. Yeah. The king of the Pol Ex.

209
00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:33.922
In fact, I am the king
of the North Pole!

210
00:25:35.675 --> 00:25:37.968
Oh, where's my manners?
Sit, sit. Sit.

211
00:25:38.135 --> 00:25:39.803
Take a load off.

212
00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:42.305
Hey, would you like some Joe?

213
00:25:42.473 --> 00:25:48.019
Nice hot refreshment.
Perfect for a cold winter's night.

214
00:25:57.905 --> 00:25:59.906
There. Bless you.

215
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:04.035
What about Santa?

216
00:26:04.203 --> 00:26:07.872
- Santa?
- Isn't he the king of the North Pole?

217
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.251
You mean this guy?

218
00:26:26.392 --> 00:26:31.062
What exactly is your
persuasion on the big man?

219
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.564
Since you brought him up.

220
00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:36.901
Well, I...

221
00:26:37.069 --> 00:26:39.195
I want to believe.

222
00:26:40.072 --> 00:26:43.116
- But...
- But you don't wanna be bamboozled.

223
00:26:43.284 --> 00:26:46.369
You don't wanna be led
down the primrose path.

224
00:26:46.537 --> 00:26:50.749
You don't wanna be conned or duped,
have the wool pulled over your eyes.

225
00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:55.045
Hoodwinked. You don't wanna be
taken for a ride, railroaded.

226
00:26:58.883 --> 00:27:01.926
Seeing is believing.

227
00:27:02.428 --> 00:27:03.887
Am I right?

228
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.390
But what about this train?

229
00:27:09.018 --> 00:27:10.435
What about it?

230
00:27:10.603 --> 00:27:13.563
We're all really going
to the North Pole...

231
00:27:13.731 --> 00:27:14.939
aren't we?

232
00:27:15.232 --> 00:27:17.525
Aren't we?

233
00:27:18.486 --> 00:27:22.906
Are you saying that this
is all just a dream?

234
00:27:23.115 --> 00:27:26.701
You said it, kid. Not me.

235
00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.209
So let's go find that girl.

236
00:27:40.466 --> 00:27:42.592
One other thing.

237
00:27:43.844 --> 00:27:46.012
Do you believe in ghosts?

238
00:27:49.725 --> 00:27:51.601
Interesting.

239
00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:55.772
Wait.

240
00:27:58.192 --> 00:28:06.192
Wait!

241
00:28:12.915 --> 00:28:14.499
I have to wake up.

242
00:28:14.667 --> 00:28:16.709
Yeah. I have to wake up.

243
00:28:17.044 --> 00:28:20.296
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

244
00:28:20.548 --> 00:28:22.715
Wake up!

245
00:28:38.315 --> 00:28:41.776
Kid!

246
00:28:41.944 --> 00:28:44.154
Kid, get your head
out of the clouds!

247
00:28:44.321 --> 00:28:45.864
Wake up, kid!

248
00:28:46.031 --> 00:28:49.826
There's no sleepwalking
on the Polar Express.

249
00:28:50.786 --> 00:28:52.662
We gotta jump them knuckles.

250
00:28:55.374 --> 00:28:57.333
Come on, kid. Flip my shoulders.

251
00:28:57.501 --> 00:28:59.335
Grab my lily.

252
00:29:01.964 --> 00:29:04.466
That skirt you're chasing
must have moved ahead.

253
00:29:05.134 --> 00:29:09.053
- We gotta hightail it to the hog, pronto.
- To the hog?

254
00:29:09.889 --> 00:29:13.224
The engine. The engine,
you tenderfoot.

255
00:29:13.392 --> 00:29:16.603
We gotta make the engine
before we hit Flat Top Tunnel.

256
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.438
How come?

257
00:29:18.606 --> 00:29:21.232
So many questions.

258
00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.987
There is but one inch of clearance
between the roof of this rattler...

259
00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:29.032
and the roof of Flat Top Tunnel.

260
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.075
Savvy?

261
00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:37.248
It's just the run up
to the hump, kid.

262
00:29:38.083 --> 00:29:39.751
This will be interesting.

263
00:30:02.942 --> 00:30:04.651
Get back on, kid. Hurry!

264
00:30:04.818 --> 00:30:07.111
Grab my muck stick.

265
00:30:42.815 --> 00:30:45.316
There's only one
trick to this, kid.

266
00:30:46.485 --> 00:30:47.986
When I say "jump"...

267
00:30:50.406 --> 00:30:54.325
you jump!

268
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:20.310
You. I thought you got
thrown off, and...

269
00:31:20.686 --> 00:31:23.521
- You're driving the train?
- They put me in charge.

270
00:31:23.689 --> 00:31:27.108
- The engineer had to check the light.
- Here's the light. Careful.

271
00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:28.943
All right, now.

272
00:31:31.071 --> 00:31:32.572
I got it.

273
00:31:35.284 --> 00:31:38.786
- How do you know how?
- It's easy. Come here, I'll show you.

274
00:31:38.954 --> 00:31:41.414
This big lever here,
that's the throttle.

275
00:31:41.582 --> 00:31:43.708
This little one here,
that's the brake.

276
00:31:43.876 --> 00:31:46.753
And those are the
pressure gauges.

277
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.505
And that rope is the whistle.

278
00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:51.883
The whistle.

279
00:31:52.676 --> 00:31:54.594
You wanna try it?

280
00:31:57.431 --> 00:32:00.433
I've wanted to do
that my whole life.

281
00:32:03.979 --> 00:32:07.148
Hold still! Hold still!
Don't move!

282
00:32:08.317 --> 00:32:09.359
Look!

283
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.041
Stop the train! Stop the train!

284
00:32:26.085 --> 00:32:27.919
Stop the train!

285
00:32:30.881 --> 00:32:32.590
What?

286
00:32:32.758 --> 00:32:35.426
They want us to stop the train.

287
00:32:35.594 --> 00:32:38.054
- Which one is the brake?
- He told me this was.

288
00:32:38.222 --> 00:32:39.931
- Who?
- The engineer.

289
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:44.727
- The engineer? This one looks like a brake.
- No, he said this was the brake.

290
00:32:44.895 --> 00:32:48.731
Are you sure?

291
00:32:55.823 --> 00:32:58.533
Pull the brake!

292
00:32:58.742 --> 00:33:00.618
Stop the train!

293
00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.929
Caribou?

294
00:33:22.474 --> 00:33:26.352
There can be no Christmas without
the Polar Express arriving on time.

295
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.814
Am I the only one who
understands that?

296
00:33:29.982 --> 00:33:32.775
You. I should have known.

297
00:33:32.943 --> 00:33:36.821
Are you bound and determined that this
train never reaches the North Pole?

298
00:33:36.989 --> 00:33:38.573
But look.

299
00:33:39.825 --> 00:33:41.492
Caribou crossing?!

300
00:33:42.327 --> 00:33:46.080
I make that herd to be at least
100,000, maybe even a million.

301
00:33:46.248 --> 00:33:49.333
It's gonna be hours before
they clear this track.

302
00:33:49.501 --> 00:33:53.546
- A tough nut to crack.
- We are in some serious jelly.

303
00:33:53.714 --> 00:33:56.174
- And a jam.
- Tight spot.

304
00:33:56.341 --> 00:33:57.675
- Up a creek.
- Up a tree.

305
00:33:57.843 --> 00:34:01.053
- Lost in the grass.
- I'll tell you what's grass: Our a...

306
00:34:43.472 --> 00:34:47.892
Problem solved. All ahead, slow.

307
00:35:33.856 --> 00:35:35.773
We're going pretty fast.

308
00:35:35.941 --> 00:35:38.818
Tell the engineer to slow down.

309
00:35:44.157 --> 00:35:45.783
Slow it down.

310
00:35:47.661 --> 00:35:50.413
Watch the speed!

311
00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.504
Jumping jeepers, the
cotter pin sheared off.

312
00:35:58.672 --> 00:35:59.964
- What?
- The pin.

313
00:36:00.132 --> 00:36:02.300
- Where?
- There.

314
00:36:02.467 --> 00:36:04.010
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

315
00:36:05.053 --> 00:36:07.972
- They can't hear me.
- They can't?

316
00:36:11.476 --> 00:36:13.895
I don't like the look of this.
Under the safety bar.

317
00:36:16.273 --> 00:36:17.953
Is everything all right?
What should we do?

318
00:36:18.108 --> 00:36:22.570
Considering we've lost
communication with the engineer...

319
00:36:22.738 --> 00:36:25.907
we are standing totally exposed
on the front of the locomotive...

320
00:36:26.074 --> 00:36:29.243
the train appears to be
accelerating uncontrollably...

321
00:36:29.411 --> 00:36:33.247
and we are rapidly
approaching Glacier Gulch...

322
00:36:33.415 --> 00:36:36.918
which happens to be the steepest
downhill grade in the world...

323
00:36:37.085 --> 00:36:40.379
I suggest we all hold on...

324
00:36:40.923 --> 00:36:43.174
tightly.

325
00:37:03.362 --> 00:37:05.196
- The pin.
- The pin.

326
00:37:24.883 --> 00:37:28.594
Jiminy Christmas, the ice
has frozen over the tracks.

327
00:37:50.993 --> 00:37:53.160
Hold on. Hold on. No, no.

328
00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:56.205
Come on. Watch your step.

329
00:37:56.373 --> 00:37:59.583
Come on, sweetie. Up you go.
Up you go.

330
00:38:02.045 --> 00:38:04.505
Put your feet on here. On here.

331
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.342
Little adventure, huh?

332
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.928
Young man, quick
thinking on your part.

333
00:38:32.034 --> 00:38:34.785
Step to your left, please.
To your left.

334
00:38:38.623 --> 00:38:42.126
Well, that is more like it.

335
00:38:44.504 --> 00:38:47.214
What in the name of Mike?

336
00:38:50.343 --> 00:38:51.802
Look.

337
00:38:54.431 --> 00:38:57.183
Get us the blazes out of here!

338
00:39:05.442 --> 00:39:07.026
Turn this sled around.

339
00:39:25.504 --> 00:39:26.921
Look there.

340
00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:30.966
Tracks.

341
00:39:31.134 --> 00:39:32.551
Dead ahead.

342
00:39:38.391 --> 00:39:39.517
Right.

343
00:39:45.357 --> 00:39:46.357
Left.

344
00:39:51.863 --> 00:39:52.863
Right.

345
00:39:56.743 --> 00:39:57.993
Hang a Louie.

346
00:40:01.123 --> 00:40:02.498
Toss a Ritchie.

347
00:40:05.877 --> 00:40:07.545
Port astern.

348
00:40:09.714 --> 00:40:11.549
To the starboard.

349
00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:15.427
- My slipper.
- You're gonna lose your ticket.

350
00:40:15.595 --> 00:40:17.471
It's not my ticket, it's yours.

351
00:40:17.639 --> 00:40:19.473
- It's my ticket?
- Yes.

352
00:40:19.641 --> 00:40:21.767
Right. Keep up with me. Left.

353
00:40:22.102 --> 00:40:24.520
Right. Left.

354
00:40:28.567 --> 00:40:29.900
Right.

355
00:40:30.235 --> 00:40:31.527
Left.

356
00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:33.070
Right.

357
00:40:33.238 --> 00:40:35.197
Left. Right.

358
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:40.202
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

359
00:40:42.414 --> 00:40:44.248
Brace yourselves!

360
00:40:55.302 --> 00:40:57.219
Well, that's more like it.

361
00:40:59.598 --> 00:41:01.140
Thank you.

362
00:41:01.308 --> 00:41:04.602
Thank you. I can't believe
you found my ticket.

363
00:41:05.145 --> 00:41:07.771
Did someone say they
found a ticket?

364
00:41:09.774 --> 00:41:13.194
Well, in that case...
Tickets, please.

365
00:41:22.078 --> 00:41:23.621
Thank you.

366
00:41:25.332 --> 00:41:29.251
- "L-E"?
- Just like that know-it-all kid.

367
00:41:44.184 --> 00:41:46.769
Watch your step.
Tricky walking up here.

368
00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:49.313
It's mighty slick.
Mighty slick, I tell you.

369
00:41:50.482 --> 00:41:53.025
There you go.
What did I tell you?

370
00:41:53.193 --> 00:41:58.322
Years ago, on my first Christmas Eve run,
I was up on the roof making my rounds...

371
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.407
when I slipped on
the ice myself.

372
00:42:00.575 --> 00:42:03.994
I reached out for a hand iron, but
it broke off. I slid and fell.

373
00:42:04.162 --> 00:42:08.165
And yet, I did not
fall off this train.

374
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.001
Someone saved you?

375
00:42:11.169 --> 00:42:13.170
Or something.

376
00:42:16.049 --> 00:42:17.341
An angel.

377
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.927
Maybe.

378
00:42:20.095 --> 00:42:22.179
Wait. Wait.

379
00:42:23.014 --> 00:42:26.183
What did he look like?
Did you see him?

380
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:31.188
No, sir. But sometimes
seeing is believing.

381
00:42:31.564 --> 00:42:36.694
And sometimes the most real things in
the world are the things we can't see.

382
00:42:42.534 --> 00:42:44.868
The forsaken and the abandoned.

383
00:42:46.037 --> 00:42:50.040
Mind your step, now. These poor
toys have suffered enough...

384
00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:54.545
being left to rust and decay in the back
alleys and vacant lots of the world.

385
00:42:55.046 --> 00:42:59.216
- What are they doing here?
- It's a new concept the boss came up with.

386
00:42:59.384 --> 00:43:02.761
Instead of being thrown away,
they're collected. Refurbished.

387
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:08.559
He calls it "rebicycling."
Something like that.

388
00:43:10.812 --> 00:43:13.230
Makes me wanna cry...

389
00:43:13.398 --> 00:43:16.567
seeing toys that were
treated this way.

390
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.572
These hopelessly entangled string
puppets and marionettes...

391
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:26.035
pose a particular problem. We found the
nimble fingers of our work force...

392
00:43:26.202 --> 00:43:30.539
here at the North Pole are best for
working out those knots and tangles.

393
00:43:30.707 --> 00:43:33.250
Thank you. Double-locked here.

394
00:43:44.637 --> 00:43:48.098
You are just like me, my friend.

395
00:43:48.266 --> 00:43:50.642
A scrooge!

396
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.978
Ebenezer Scrooge.

397
00:43:53.146 --> 00:43:56.482
North Pole, Santa
Claus, this train...

398
00:43:56.649 --> 00:44:00.569
it's all a bunch of humbug.
A bout of indigestion.

399
00:44:00.737 --> 00:44:03.322
Oh, yeah. I know what you are.

400
00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:06.116
You're a doubter.

401
00:44:06.284 --> 00:44:08.827
A doubter. You don't believe!

402
00:44:08.995 --> 00:44:12.164
You're a doubter!
You don't believe!

403
00:44:29.265 --> 00:44:32.184
You missed it. We rode down
some really sharp hills.

404
00:44:32.352 --> 00:44:36.730
We were on what looked like a frozen lake.
But I know it was just an optical illusion.

405
00:44:36.898 --> 00:44:39.817
He said the train was on ice.
I said it's impossible...

406
00:44:39.984 --> 00:44:42.694
You can't put a train track...
Where you going now?

407
00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:00.170
I'm wishing on a star.

408
00:45:00.338 --> 00:45:03.507
And trying to believe.

409
00:45:03.675 --> 00:45:06.844
That even though it's far.

410
00:45:07.303 --> 00:45:09.847
He'll find me Christmas Eve.

411
00:45:10.473 --> 00:45:13.600
I guess that Santa's busy.

412
00:45:13.768 --> 00:45:16.770
'Cause he's never come around.

413
00:45:17.272 --> 00:45:23.026
I think of him When
Christmas comes to town.

414
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.989
The best time of the year.

415
00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:30.367
When everyone comes home.

416
00:45:30.535 --> 00:45:33.704
With all this Christmas cheer.

417
00:45:33.872 --> 00:45:37.416
It's hard to be alone.

418
00:45:37.584 --> 00:45:43.630
Putting up the Christmas tree
With friends who come around.

419
00:45:43.798 --> 00:45:50.179
It's so much fun When
Christmas comes to town.

420
00:45:50.972 --> 00:45:57.060
Presents for the children
Wrapped in red and green.

421
00:45:57.604 --> 00:46:03.400
All the things I've heard
about But never really seen.

422
00:46:04.235 --> 00:46:06.737
No one will be sleeping.

423
00:46:06.905 --> 00:46:09.990
On the night of Christmas Eve.

424
00:46:10.158 --> 00:46:17.247
Hoping Santa's on his way.

425
00:46:17.415 --> 00:46:20.501
When Santa's sleighbells ring

426
00:46:20.668 --> 00:46:23.545
I listen all around.

427
00:46:23.713 --> 00:46:26.924
The herald angels sing

428
00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:30.093
I never hear a sound.

429
00:46:30.637 --> 00:46:34.097
And all the dreams of children.

430
00:46:34.265 --> 00:46:37.059
Once lost will all be found.

431
00:46:37.227 --> 00:46:45.227
That's all I want When
Christmas comes to town.

432
00:47:05.713 --> 00:47:07.172
Look.

433
00:47:09.842 --> 00:47:11.843
The northern lights.

434
00:47:14.681 --> 00:47:16.723
Hey. You three.

435
00:47:17.934 --> 00:47:19.726
We just crossed it.

436
00:47:19.894 --> 00:47:25.315
Latitude 66°33'.
The Arctic Circle.

437
00:47:25.483 --> 00:47:28.819
And do you see?
Those lights in the distance.

438
00:47:29.737 --> 00:47:34.199
They look like the lights of a strange
ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.

439
00:47:35.493 --> 00:47:37.494
There...

440
00:47:38.162 --> 00:47:40.205
is the North Pole.

441
00:47:45.211 --> 00:47:48.046
It's a magic carpet on a
rail It never takes a rest.

442
00:47:48.214 --> 00:47:51.383
Flying through The
mountains and the snow.

443
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:54.511
You can ride for free and join
the fun If you just say yes.

444
00:47:54.679 --> 00:47:58.015
'Cause that's the way things
happen On the Polar Express.

445
00:47:58.182 --> 00:48:01.310
Whoo, whoo, the whistle blows
That's the sound of her singing.

446
00:48:01.477 --> 00:48:04.688
Ding, ding, the bell will
ring Golly, look at her go.

447
00:48:04.856 --> 00:48:07.858
You wonder if you'll get
there soon Anybody's guess.

448
00:48:08.026 --> 00:48:11.236
'Cause that's the way things
happen On the Polar Express.

449
00:48:11.404 --> 00:48:14.531
When we get there
We'll scream, "Yay!"

450
00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:17.034
We'll arrive with A
bang, bang, bang.

451
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:20.203
Boom, boom, boom
Laughing all the way.

452
00:48:25.209 --> 00:48:28.128
We made it. With five
minutes to spare.

453
00:48:28.296 --> 00:48:30.172
We made it.

454
00:48:55.615 --> 00:48:57.908
There should be elves.
Where are the elves?

455
00:48:58.076 --> 00:48:59.743
Yeah, where are the elves?

456
00:48:59.911 --> 00:49:02.245
They are gathering in
the center of the city.

457
00:49:02.413 --> 00:49:06.208
That is where Santa will give
the first gift of Christmas.

458
00:49:07.085 --> 00:49:09.544
Who gets the first
gift of Christmas?

459
00:49:09.712 --> 00:49:13.590
He will choose one of you.

460
00:49:16.803 --> 00:49:19.596
- Look.
- Elves!

461
00:49:50.461 --> 00:49:52.796
All right. All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

462
00:49:52.964 --> 00:49:55.674
Two columns, if you please.

463
00:49:55.842 --> 00:49:58.635
Shorter in the front,
taller in the rear.

464
00:49:59.137 --> 00:50:02.764
Even-numbered birthdays on the
right, odd-numbered on the left.

465
00:50:02.932 --> 00:50:05.851
No pushing. No pushing.
But let's not dilly-dally.

466
00:50:06.018 --> 00:50:07.936
It's five minutes to midnight.

467
00:50:08.104 --> 00:50:11.690
Hey, what gives? It was five minutes
till midnight four minutes ago.

468
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:14.651
Exactly. Columns of two.

469
00:50:14.819 --> 00:50:16.945
- One, two.
- Excuse me.

470
00:50:17.113 --> 00:50:19.573
- Question.
- What about him?

471
00:50:22.326 --> 00:50:25.036
No one is required to see Santa.

472
00:50:26.164 --> 00:50:29.374
Ladies and gentlemen, you do
not have to hold hands...

473
00:50:29.542 --> 00:50:33.003
- Come on.
- But please remain in your columns...

474
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:35.547
while we are in transit.

475
00:50:45.183 --> 00:50:48.685
- Look, you have to come with us.
- She's right.

476
00:50:50.605 --> 00:50:55.066
Christmas just doesn't work
out for me. Never has.

477
00:50:55.234 --> 00:50:57.861
But Christmas is such a
wonderful, beautiful time.

478
00:50:58.029 --> 00:51:01.656
It's a time for giving and being
thankful, for friends and family.

479
00:51:01.824 --> 00:51:06.620
People hang decorations and lights. Santa
leaves presents under our Christmas trees.

480
00:51:08.539 --> 00:51:10.290
Christmas just...

481
00:51:10.875 --> 00:51:12.751
doesn't work out for me.

482
00:51:14.545 --> 00:51:18.256
Look, I don't know if Christmas is
gonna work out for you or not...

483
00:51:18.424 --> 00:51:21.551
but this is Christmas Eve.
Don't stay here by yourself.

484
00:51:23.221 --> 00:51:24.763
Yes, come with us.

485
00:51:25.306 --> 00:51:27.098
We'll go together.

486
00:51:39.195 --> 00:51:40.821
Oh, no.

487
00:51:48.871 --> 00:51:50.747
We're gonna be okay.

488
00:51:53.084 --> 00:51:55.210
Maybe not!

489
00:51:57.088 --> 00:52:01.174
The emergency brake.

490
00:52:04.887 --> 00:52:08.682
There's no brake.
I can't find the brake!

491
00:52:15.189 --> 00:52:17.774
Take a break, kid.

492
00:52:17.942 --> 00:52:21.611
How about a nice,
good hot cup of Joe?

493
00:52:50.224 --> 00:52:51.308
We're gonna crash!

494
00:52:58.316 --> 00:53:00.233
We're spinning.

495
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.969
You hear that?

496
00:53:28.554 --> 00:53:29.846
The bell.

497
00:53:31.223 --> 00:53:33.600
- What bell?
- The sleighbell.

498
00:53:33.768 --> 00:53:36.186
- Sleighbell?
- Don't you hear it?

499
00:53:37.521 --> 00:53:40.065
It's coming from that tunnel.

500
00:53:45.613 --> 00:53:47.739
That's the way we should go.

501
00:53:56.207 --> 00:53:57.749
Come on.

502
00:54:29.949 --> 00:54:31.533
What?

503
00:54:32.034 --> 00:54:34.703
- What?
- Come on.

504
00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:47.716
Come on.

505
00:54:57.518 --> 00:54:59.310
We're lost.

506
00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.697
Yes.

507
00:55:11.949 --> 00:55:14.868
- Yes. I hear it.
- I hear it too.

508
00:55:15.036 --> 00:55:19.122
- I don't hear anything.
- Okay, it's down this way.

509
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:20.498
Are you sure?

510
00:55:25.087 --> 00:55:26.337
Absolutely.

511
00:55:32.136 --> 00:55:34.637
Why can't I hear anything?

512
00:55:37.224 --> 00:55:39.851
Get down and be quiet.

513
00:55:48.986 --> 00:55:50.320
Yeah.

514
00:55:53.324 --> 00:55:54.866
Okay.

515
00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:57.911
Well, that was the
wrapping hall, chief.

516
00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:00.663
- Just finished the last one.
- How's it wrapped?

517
00:56:00.831 --> 00:56:04.751
It's wrapped in candy-striped red
with a number-seven holly-green bow.

518
00:56:04.919 --> 00:56:08.213
A number-seven bow?
When we're this close to liftoff?

519
00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:11.841
What are they thinking down
there? Are they meshuggener?

520
00:56:12.009 --> 00:56:14.260
- What's the routing?
- Going to the States.

521
00:56:14.428 --> 00:56:16.638
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

522
00:56:17.181 --> 00:56:20.183
That's my town.
I'm from Grand Rapids.

523
00:56:25.481 --> 00:56:28.525
We got a troublemaker now.
Just what we need.

524
00:56:28.692 --> 00:56:31.611
Things aren't bad enough.
What's his 20?

525
00:56:31.779 --> 00:56:35.073
Apparently, some kid from
Maplewood, New Jersey...

526
00:56:35.241 --> 00:56:37.659
stuck some gum in
his sister's hair.

527
00:56:38.536 --> 00:56:41.579
New Jersey? Is that the same
kid that put the tack...

528
00:56:41.914 --> 00:56:46.751
- underneath his teacher's chair last year?
- No, sir. This kid's name is Steven.

529
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.880
So, what do we do, chief?
Alert the big man?

530
00:56:51.048 --> 00:56:54.050
We talking nothing
for Christmas here?

531
00:57:00.891 --> 00:57:06.604
I didn't do it.

532
00:57:08.941 --> 00:57:11.401
Look, it's...
It's almost Christmas, huh?

533
00:57:12.027 --> 00:57:13.736
We'll cut the kid a break.

534
00:57:13.904 --> 00:57:16.197
But put him on the check-twice
list for next year.

535
00:57:16.907 --> 00:57:19.033
All right, boys.

536
00:57:19.243 --> 00:57:22.328
Let's shut it down.
That's it for this year. Come on.

537
00:57:22.496 --> 00:57:27.041
- Hey, boss, are we taking the pneumatic?
- Of course we're taking the pneumatic.

538
00:57:27.209 --> 00:57:30.378
It's the only way to get
to the square on time.

539
00:57:30.546 --> 00:57:33.798
- Let's go.
- And time is money.

540
00:57:34.425 --> 00:57:37.177
Ready, and mount.

541
00:57:38.596 --> 00:57:41.264
Good. Close.

542
00:57:55.821 --> 00:57:57.655
All right, get in.

543
00:57:59.116 --> 00:58:01.242
I don't know about this.

544
00:58:36.153 --> 00:58:38.988
I don't hear it. Do you?

545
00:58:40.324 --> 00:58:41.950
No.

546
00:58:43.577 --> 00:58:46.079
I think we should
follow those arrows.

547
00:59:00.344 --> 00:59:02.804
I thought there'd be a way out.

548
00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:05.181
We're gonna miss everything.

549
00:59:15.192 --> 00:59:16.818
Hey, look.

550
00:59:18.279 --> 00:59:19.821
A present.

551
00:59:24.159 --> 00:59:27.161
It's going to my town.
To someone named Billy.

552
00:59:27.329 --> 00:59:32.917
- My name is Billy.
- It's going to 11344 Edbrooke Avenue.

553
00:59:33.085 --> 00:59:34.961
That's my address.

554
00:59:42.761 --> 00:59:44.345
Come on.

555
01:00:44.448 --> 01:00:45.782
Look.

556
01:00:47.326 --> 01:00:50.787
It says, "Merry Christmas,
Billy. From Mr. C."

557
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:56.167
I think I know what it is.
I wanted one of these my whole life.

558
01:00:57.127 --> 01:00:59.462
Wait, wait. Stop. Look.

559
01:01:01.548 --> 01:01:03.674
But I...

560
01:01:03.842 --> 01:01:05.676
Those are the rules.

561
01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:08.257
Something's got me.

562
01:03:08.425 --> 01:03:10.134
It's got my leg.

563
01:03:10.677 --> 01:03:12.053
I can't hold him.

564
01:03:12.596 --> 01:03:15.515
Give me your other hand.
Give me your other hand.

565
01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:18.226
- I can't.
- On three.

566
01:03:18.393 --> 01:03:21.521
One, two, three.

567
01:03:22.272 --> 01:03:24.273
- Look.
- It's still got me.

568
01:03:24.441 --> 01:03:27.777
On three again. One, two, three.

569
01:03:31.114 --> 01:03:32.615
- You.
- You.

570
01:03:32.783 --> 01:03:34.825
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

571
01:03:34.993 --> 01:03:38.579
Checking my presents. Making sure
I'm getting everything on my list.

572
01:03:38.747 --> 01:03:41.666
I found one present. All it
had was stupid underwear.

573
01:03:41.833 --> 01:03:43.459
Look.

574
01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.220
You may start your
descent any time now.

575
01:03:54.388 --> 01:03:56.639
At your convenience, of course.

576
01:04:08.819 --> 01:04:12.238
It's still five to. I think
we're gonna make it.

577
01:04:12.406 --> 01:04:15.032
Of course. It's been five
to for the last hour.

578
01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.786
We got plenty of time. We got nothing
but time. We got time to kill.

579
01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:22.707
You know what? I don't
think we're gonna make it.

580
01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:28.254
I may be just an
old railroader...

581
01:04:28.422 --> 01:04:31.215
and know nothing about
lighter-than-air craft...

582
01:04:31.383 --> 01:04:36.887
but from my layman's perspective,
you need more altitude!

583
01:04:37.055 --> 01:04:39.515
More altitude!

584
01:04:40.225 --> 01:04:43.185
Altitude, please. A bit
more altitude, please.

585
01:04:44.187 --> 01:04:46.355
Geronimo!

586
01:05:01.705 --> 01:05:03.247
The Flying Elves.

587
01:05:03.415 --> 01:05:06.208
They are specialists. Do not
try that at home, kids.

588
01:05:06.376 --> 01:05:08.336
Do not try that at home.

589
01:05:08.503 --> 01:05:09.754
We're not gonna make it.

590
01:05:50.003 --> 01:05:51.629
A well-oiled machine.

591
01:06:01.431 --> 01:06:04.266
All right, you stowaways.

592
01:06:04.685 --> 01:06:07.853
- Party's over.
- I was just following them.

593
01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:09.939
We fell in here by mistake.

594
01:06:10.107 --> 01:06:13.818
Forget about it. We knew you
was in there the whole time.

595
01:06:15.737 --> 01:06:17.113
Come on, out you go.

596
01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.991
Let's go, come on.
Step up, step up. There we go.

597
01:06:21.159 --> 01:06:24.412
Not a problem. Come on.
Watch your step. There you go.

598
01:06:30.293 --> 01:06:33.629
So nobody gets hurt, here's how
we're gonna get you guys down.

599
01:06:33.797 --> 01:06:37.133
- This is simple. Why, I know...
- What do you know?

600
01:06:37.467 --> 01:06:40.970
You're not supposed to be
here in the first place.

601
01:06:41.346 --> 01:06:45.641
But since it's Christmas,
I'm gonna let you slide.

602
01:06:45.809 --> 01:06:46.809
Hey.

603
01:06:49.354 --> 01:06:50.688
Been looking for you.

604
01:06:53.817 --> 01:06:55.192
There you go.

605
01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.610
Watch your step.

606
01:06:56.778 --> 01:06:58.696
Careful.

607
01:06:58.864 --> 01:07:00.948
Beautiful form. Beautiful.

608
01:07:01.116 --> 01:07:03.492
Nice to see you again.

609
01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:08.122
Cutting it kind of
close, aren't we?

610
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:11.876
I'll take care of this.

611
01:07:12.043 --> 01:07:14.170
It's in good hands.

612
01:07:14.337 --> 01:07:17.006
Trust me.

613
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:49.038
It's the spirit of the season.

614
01:07:49.206 --> 01:07:52.750
You can feel it in the air.

615
01:07:52.918 --> 01:07:56.670
You can hear it if you listen.

616
01:07:56.838 --> 01:08:00.508
Everywhere So much care.

617
01:08:00.675 --> 01:08:02.384
Like a prayer.

618
01:08:02.552 --> 01:08:06.222
Whatever it is You
need to share it.

619
01:08:06.389 --> 01:08:14.389
It's the spirit of the season.

620
01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:34.959
You can feel it in the air.

621
01:08:48.348 --> 01:08:51.475
Aren't those bells the
most beautiful sound?

622
01:10:07.677 --> 01:10:09.219
He's here! He's here!

623
01:10:09.387 --> 01:10:10.638
Where?

624
01:10:10.805 --> 01:10:13.182
I see him. He's over there.

625
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:21.350
I can't see him.

626
01:10:37.207 --> 01:10:40.000
I can't see him!

627
01:11:42.605 --> 01:11:46.108
Doubter. Doubter.

628
01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:54.158
Okay.

629
01:11:56.661 --> 01:12:02.916
I believe.

630
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:34.323
What was that you said?

631
01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.497
I... I believe.

632
01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:47.836
I believe.

633
01:12:49.714 --> 01:12:53.967
I... I believe that
this is yours.

634
01:12:55.595 --> 01:12:57.179
Well...

635
01:12:59.015 --> 01:13:00.265
Thank you.

636
01:13:00.433 --> 01:13:03.685
- Me, me. Pick me, Santa.
- What are you doing? Stop it.

637
01:13:03.853 --> 01:13:06.939
- Pick me, pick me. I want the first gift.
- Hush.

638
01:13:07.107 --> 01:13:09.066
Young man...

639
01:13:09.234 --> 01:13:11.068
patience.

640
01:13:11.236 --> 01:13:15.906
And a smidgen of humility
might also serve you well.

641
01:13:16.074 --> 01:13:17.699
Yes, sir.

642
01:13:19.035 --> 01:13:21.328
And you, young lady...

643
01:13:21.496 --> 01:13:23.205
A lady of decision.

644
01:13:23.373 --> 01:13:27.292
Full of confidence and spirit.

645
01:13:28.044 --> 01:13:29.670
Christmas spirit.

646
01:13:32.507 --> 01:13:34.049
Keep up the good work.

647
01:13:35.468 --> 01:13:37.094
Thank you.

648
01:13:38.054 --> 01:13:39.680
And Billy.

649
01:13:41.182 --> 01:13:42.891
It is Billy?

650
01:13:44.727 --> 01:13:47.271
I see you've made
some new friends.

651
01:13:49.983 --> 01:13:51.525
Yes, sir. I sure have.

652
01:13:51.985 --> 01:13:53.944
That's a lucky lad.

653
01:13:54.112 --> 01:13:56.572
There's no greater
gift than friendship.

654
01:13:59.576 --> 01:14:02.494
And speaking of gifts...

655
01:14:06.916 --> 01:14:09.418
let's have this young
fellow right here.

656
01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.498
Now...

657
01:14:48.666 --> 01:14:51.668
what would you like
for Christmas?

658
01:14:51.836 --> 01:14:53.712
Me.

659
01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.297
You.

660
01:15:09.812 --> 01:15:12.648
Yes. Indeed.

661
01:15:15.485 --> 01:15:17.986
Yes, indeed.

662
01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:28.580
The first gift of Christmas!

663
01:15:43.137 --> 01:15:46.890
This bell is a wonderful symbol
of the spirit of Christmas...

664
01:15:47.058 --> 01:15:49.601
as am I.

665
01:15:51.437 --> 01:15:52.938
Just remember...

666
01:15:53.106 --> 01:15:55.857
the true spirit of Christmas...

667
01:15:56.025 --> 01:15:58.360
lies in your heart.

668
01:16:09.872 --> 01:16:11.707
Merry Christmas.

669
01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:16.586
Better keep that
in a safe place.

670
01:16:36.482 --> 01:16:41.361
Hey, hey. Man alive,
are you lucky.

671
01:17:03.593 --> 01:17:06.219
Pull, Comet. Pull, boy!

672
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:11.600
Prancer, that's a girl.

673
01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:18.482
Good boy, Donder.

674
01:17:50.306 --> 01:17:54.601
Now, Dasher. Now,
Prancer and Vixen.

675
01:18:03.444 --> 01:18:06.530
It's everything I
dreamed it would be.

676
01:18:06.697 --> 01:18:08.490
Could all...?

677
01:18:08.658 --> 01:18:11.618
Could all this be
nothing but a dream?

678
01:18:11.786 --> 01:18:13.328
No.

679
01:18:25.633 --> 01:18:28.051
To the top of the roof
To the top of the wall.

680
01:18:28.219 --> 01:18:33.056
Now, dash away, dash
away Dash away all.

681
01:19:05.548 --> 01:19:08.425
All aboard!

682
01:19:08.593 --> 01:19:10.510
One, two. One, two, three, go.

683
01:19:10.678 --> 01:19:14.556
Rockin' on top of the world
Rockin' on top of the world.

684
01:19:14.724 --> 01:19:16.892
The place is hoppin'
There ain't no stoppin'

685
01:19:17.059 --> 01:19:20.937
Rockin' on top of the world Lift
your spirits, swing that girl.

686
01:19:21.105 --> 01:19:23.773
Rockin' on top of the
world Tonight, yeah.

687
01:19:23.941 --> 01:19:26.276
Come on, shorty!

688
01:19:39.332 --> 01:19:41.750
Show your tickets.
Have your tickets ready.

689
01:19:41.918 --> 01:19:44.461
Remember to eat the
five basic food groups.

690
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:46.421
Ticket, please.

691
01:19:46.589 --> 01:19:49.883
And please brush
after every meal.

692
01:19:53.012 --> 01:19:55.430
Remember to duck and cover.

693
01:19:55.598 --> 01:19:57.224
All right, you. Ticket, please.

694
01:20:05.107 --> 01:20:07.692
"Lean." Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

695
01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:10.153
"Lean" is spelled
with four letters.

696
01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:12.572
I believed I punched five.

697
01:20:14.784 --> 01:20:17.619
Hey, are you saying I
don't know how to...?

698
01:20:17.787 --> 01:20:21.039
I'm sorry. It says "learn.
" My mistake.

699
01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:23.124
Lesson learned.

700
01:20:23.292 --> 01:20:24.668
Ticket.

701
01:20:41.477 --> 01:20:42.978
That is some special ticket.

702
01:20:43.145 --> 01:20:44.646
Sure is.

703
01:20:44.814 --> 01:20:49.109
So can you count on us to get
you home safe and sound?

704
01:20:51.195 --> 01:20:52.946
Absolutely.

705
01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:54.614
Me...

706
01:20:55.866 --> 01:20:57.909
and my friends.

707
01:21:00.663 --> 01:21:01.871
Ticket.

708
01:21:10.423 --> 01:21:13.508
It says "lead."
Like "lead balloon."

709
01:21:13.676 --> 01:21:16.344
I believe it also is
pronounced "lead."

710
01:21:16.512 --> 01:21:18.471
As in "leader," "leadership."

711
01:21:18.639 --> 01:21:20.849
"Lead the way."

712
01:21:21.017 --> 01:21:23.226
Follow you anywhere, ma'am.

713
01:21:26.105 --> 01:21:27.397
Ah, yes.

714
01:21:27.565 --> 01:21:30.525
Young man with all
the questions.

715
01:21:31.027 --> 01:21:32.444
Ticket.

716
01:21:42.496 --> 01:21:44.706
It says...

717
01:21:44.957 --> 01:21:46.583
It's nothing I need to know.

718
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:59.846
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Let's see it.

719
01:22:00.014 --> 01:22:02.724
- Come on, let's see the bell.
- Show us the bell.

720
01:22:02.892 --> 01:22:05.060
Yeah, let's see the bell.

721
01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.069
It's gone.

722
01:22:15.321 --> 01:22:18.156
- Where is it?
- I lost it.

723
01:22:18.324 --> 01:22:20.909
I lost the bell from
Santa's sleigh.

724
01:22:21.077 --> 01:22:22.911
It's gone?

725
01:22:24.246 --> 01:22:25.580
Don't worry.

726
01:22:25.748 --> 01:22:28.166
- We'll... We'll find it.
- Yeah, we'll find it.

727
01:22:28.334 --> 01:22:30.669
Yeah, we'll help you. All of us.

728
01:22:30.836 --> 01:22:33.672
Yeah, let's hurry out
and find it right now.

729
01:22:43.182 --> 01:22:44.933
It's too late.

730
01:22:46.435 --> 01:22:48.937
Gee, that's really too bad.

731
01:22:49.939 --> 01:22:51.606
Really.

732
01:23:06.122 --> 01:23:07.956
I'm sorry.

733
01:23:38.821 --> 01:23:42.824
11344 Edbrooke.

734
01:23:42.992 --> 01:23:48.455
Next stop, 11344 Edbrooke.

735
01:23:55.755 --> 01:23:57.672
Hey, where you going?

736
01:23:58.674 --> 01:23:59.799
Home.

737
01:23:59.967 --> 01:24:03.553
Oh, okay. Merry Christmas.

738
01:24:08.601 --> 01:24:11.519
Thanks for stopping
the train for me.

739
01:24:17.359 --> 01:24:18.985
Have a wonderful Christmas.

740
01:24:21.071 --> 01:24:23.573
Watch your step, please.

741
01:24:25.201 --> 01:24:27.202
And merry Christmas.

742
01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.512
Look.

743
01:24:48.182 --> 01:24:51.059
Santa got to Billy's
house already.

744
01:24:53.854 --> 01:24:56.606
Look, look! Santa got here!

745
01:24:56.774 --> 01:24:58.358
Isn't that amazing?

746
01:24:58.526 --> 01:25:06.526
It is amazing.

747
01:25:55.791 --> 01:25:58.084
I'm sorry about the bell.

748
01:25:58.669 --> 01:26:01.337
It was a really special present.

749
01:26:01.505 --> 01:26:03.256
Well, you know what they say.

750
01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:05.717
It's the thought that counts.

751
01:26:06.385 --> 01:26:07.844
Yeah.

752
01:26:09.013 --> 01:26:11.890
Well, see you.

753
01:26:14.476 --> 01:26:16.019
Well...

754
01:26:16.645 --> 01:26:18.271
see you.

755
01:26:19.148 --> 01:26:20.648
See you.

756
01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:36.956
Watch your step, please.

757
01:26:38.208 --> 01:26:39.459
Thank you.

758
01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:42.170
No, thank you.

759
01:26:43.923 --> 01:26:45.715
One thing about trains:

760
01:26:45.883 --> 01:26:47.967
It doesn't matter
where they're going.

761
01:26:48.135 --> 01:26:52.180
What matters is
deciding to get on.

762
01:27:09.156 --> 01:27:10.657
Merry Christmas!

763
01:27:14.370 --> 01:27:15.578
What?

764
01:27:16.705 --> 01:27:21.250
Merry Christmas!

765
01:28:29.778 --> 01:28:34.157
Wake up. Wake up.
Santa's been here. Santa's been here.

766
01:28:34.324 --> 01:28:35.992
Hurry up. Hurry up!

767
01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.495
Mom, Dad, wake up. Wake up!

768
01:28:39.663 --> 01:28:42.665
Santa's been here!
Santa's been here!

769
01:28:42.833 --> 01:28:46.753
Mom, Dad, look! He brought
us all kinds of stuff!

770
01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.464
Look, a train!

771
01:29:05.856 --> 01:29:11.360
This is the beautiful-est, most
wonderful-est Christmas ever.

772
01:29:11.528 --> 01:29:13.821
Wait. Look.

773
01:29:15.115 --> 01:29:16.991
Here's one more.

774
01:29:18.535 --> 01:29:20.411
Has your name on it.

775
01:29:49.399 --> 01:29:51.901
Found this on the
seat of my sleigh.

776
01:29:52.069 --> 01:29:54.737
Better fix that hole
in your pocket.

777
01:29:54.905 --> 01:29:56.155
Mr. C.

778
01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:09.377
Oh, what a beautiful bell.
Who's it from?

779
01:30:09.545 --> 01:30:11.587
- Santa.
- Santa?

780
01:30:11.755 --> 01:30:13.381
Really?

781
01:30:14.424 --> 01:30:16.843
- Oh, that's too bad.
- What's this?

782
01:30:17.886 --> 01:30:19.387
Broken.

783
01:30:20.514 --> 01:30:22.682
Sorry about that, sport.

784
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:30.356
Come on, kids.
We don't wanna be late.

785
01:30:38.407 --> 01:30:41.909
At one time, most of my
friends could hear the bell.

786
01:30:42.077 --> 01:30:46.122
But as years passed, it fell
silent for all of them.

787
01:30:46.290 --> 01:30:51.586
Even Sarah found, one Christmas, that she
could no longer hear its sweet sound.

788
01:30:51.753 --> 01:30:53.421
Though I've grown old...

789
01:30:53.589 --> 01:30:55.965
the bell still rings for me.

790
01:30:56.133 --> 01:31:00.219
As it does for all
who truly believe.
