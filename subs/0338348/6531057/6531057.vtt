Years ago, on my first

518
00:41:58.369 --> 00:42:00.439
I was up on the roof
making my rounds...

519

...when I slipped
on the ice myself.

520

I reached out for a hand
iron, but it broke off.

521

I slid and fell.

522

Thanks for stopping
the train for me.

1003

Have a wonderful Christmas.

Watch your step, please.

1005
01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.460
And merry Christmas.

Look, look! Santa got here!

1010

Isn't that amazing?

It is amazing.

It was a really special present.

Well, you know what they say.

1016
01:26:05.532 --> 01:26:06.679
It's the thought that counts.

1017
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.398
Yeah.

1018
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.960
Well, see you.

One thing about trains:

1026
01:26:48.005 --> 01:26:49.460
It doesn't matter
where they're going.

1027
01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:53.218
What matters is
deciding to get on.

that she could no longer
