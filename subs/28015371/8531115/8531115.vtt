[low grunting]

10
00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.724
Trying to freeze me and the kid
before we get to town, Marshall?

11
00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:06.209
It's colder than the
balls of hell in here.

12
00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.420
Bowels, dumb shit.

13
00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.089
[chuckles]

14
00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.256
What?

15
00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.386
Never mind.

16
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.180
- The fuck you say?
- Sit the fuck down, Floyd.

17
00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.893
Settle down, Jane.

18
00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:26.896
[sighs]

19
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.114
Nah, she ain't her.

[horses neigh and snort]

23
00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:58.803
I wouldn't go out there.

24
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.305
Yeah. Why not?

25
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.391
Doesn't smell right.

26
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:06.435
[coachman] Deputy?

27
00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:07.705

Stay here.

30
00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:29.500
Can I help you, ma'am?

31
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:33.504
Got thrown. Horse took off.

32
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.173
Messed up my leg.

33
00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.510

35
00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:42.907
What is it?

36
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.308
[grunts, groans]

37
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.811
- You wanna let me out of these shackles?
- [grunts]

38
00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:50.813
[keys jingle]

39
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.220
Jesus, Deputy, he's just a kid.

40
00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.359
I won't hesitate to shoot you.

41
00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:58.154
[tense music playing]

42
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:02.259
[grunts] Hey, are you
really Calamity Jane?

43
00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:03.534
Stop your whinin'.

44
00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.333
Alton wants your
coachin' horses,

45
00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.168
and your guns of course.

46
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.015
And any other valuables
you may be carrying

47
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.940
on your persons or otherwise.

48
00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.775
- Okay, on the count three.
- What? Wha...

49
00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.510
- One.
- [gasps and sputters]

[Jane grunts]

51
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.222
Press down.

52
00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.589
[Mason] I am the Deputy Sheriff
in the city of Deadwood,

53
00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:29.894
transportin' these prisoners
back to face justice.

54
00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:31.854
And?

55
00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.401
- [arrow whistles and thuds]
- [low grunt]

56
00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.241
[horses neigh]

57
00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.718
[Mason] I'm afraid
we're at an impasse.

58
00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.202
I'm not surrendering this stage.

59
00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.871
- [tense music intensifies]
- [rider grunts]

60
00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.834
- [rider grunts]
- Get.

[grunts, pants]

74

[grunts] Take your time.

75
00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:56.773
- [gunshot]
- [grunts, groans]

76
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.943

77
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.155
- [horses neigh]
- Whoa! Whoa.

78
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.118
- [horses snorting]
- [both breathing deeply]

79
00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:12.222
- What are you doin'?
- Well, I appreciate the help,

80
00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:15.124
but that don't change the fact
you got a date with the judge.

81
00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.336
You no-good son of a.

82
00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.923
- [Jane grunts]
- [tense music sting]

83
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.512
[bluegrass music playing]

84
00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.296
Where's Slaughter?

85
00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.175
Didn't make it.

86
00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.178
Goddamn it.

87
00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:10.721
How'd our cargo fare?

88
00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:14.350
[door squeaks and thuds]

89
00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.352
- Two out of three.
- [snaps fingers]

90
00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.729
- Come on.
- [Lance grunts]

91
00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:22.900
- [chains jingling]
- [Lance grunts]

92
00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:25.403
Calamity fuckin' Jane.

93
00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.197
You need to get
that kid a doctor.

94
00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.199
I need to get you
both in that cell.

95
00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:31.576
You swore an oath.

96
00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:35.204
In a land built on broken oaths?

97
00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:41.085
He'll get a fair trial
if he lasts that long.

98
00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:43.087
- [horse snorts]
- Now...

99
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.927
if I were you, I'd be
a little more concerned

100
00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:52.513
about my own prospects.

101
00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:59.103
Keep watch, Deputy.

102
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.440
It'd be a shame if
anything happened to them.

103
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.442
Go on.

104
00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:13.284
Yeah, from what I hear, your sheriff
ain't much for following the law.

105
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.246
Rumor has it, he likes
being judge and executioner.

106
00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:21.292
You okay with that?

107
00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:23.961
[handcuffs rattle]

108
00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:25.755
What about me saving your ass?

109
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:30.259
You think saving a couple lives
absolves you of your sins?

110
00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:33.221
Well, shit.

111
00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:36.766
I figured it couldn't hurt.

112
00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:47.235
[whistles]

113
00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:49.153
[soft grunt]

114
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.155
Calamity...

115
00:08:53.282 --> 00:08:56.786
Calamity Jane? [Chuckles]

116
00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.249
You know who I am?

117
00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:07.797
No. Nor do I give
a buffalo shit.

118
00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.131
[chuckles]

119
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:12.634
Well,

120
00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.406
I'm wanted for murder
in five states. [Laughs]

121
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.975
He says they gonna
hang me in the morning.

122
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.578
Well I tell you a little secret?

123
00:09:21.602 --> 00:09:24.522
Ain't the first
time that they try.

124
00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:28.693
I ain't yet done
leaving my mark.

125
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:34.925
[chains rattle]

126
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.118
Hey. Hmm.

127
00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.874
My brother's coming
tomorrow to bust me out.

128
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:49.839
I might let you come
with us if you ask nice.

129
00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.340
[laughs]

130
00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.217
I'm good.

131
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.388
You best not piss me off,

132
00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:01.225
or you're gonna be

133
00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.353
next.

134
00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:08.733
Yeah, that's right.
Take a nice look.

135
00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:11.861
[yells]

136
00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.029
Hey.

137
00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:15.072
[laughs]

138
00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:16.800
Keep it down in there.

139
00:10:16.824 --> 00:10:19.469
[laughs]

140
00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:23.914
You're exactly the firestorm
I imagined, Calamity Jane.

141
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:25.207
[whoops]

142
00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.169
[laughs]

143
00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:32.923
Calamity Jane.

144
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:38.262
Calamity fuckin' Jane. [Laughs]

145
00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:44.393
[pencil scratching]

146
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:54.528
[pencil scratching continues]

147
00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:58.532
Whose the letter for?

148
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:01.619
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

149
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.622
You mean ain't nobody
gonna read your letter?

150
00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:09.960
It's not a letter. It's a book.

151
00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:11.587
[laughs] A book?

152
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.594
I was covering the war
for Harper's Weekly

153
00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:20.930
until the killing got to me.

154
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.808
Family's torn apart,
fighting one another,

155
00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:25.601
it was a rotten deal.

156
00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:29.647
So I headed out
West and here I am.

157
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:32.316
A writer.

158
00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:34.944
Damn.

159
00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:37.780
What's the book about?

160
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.449
So how'd you get the
name Calamity Jane?

161
00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:42.827
I'm guessing your mama
didn't call you that.

162
00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.389
Now, Deputy, you're not thinking
about putting little old me

163
00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:48.290
- in your book now, are you?
- [Mason chuckles]

164
00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.753
They called me Martha.

165
00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:55.506
Mama died of pneumonia
when I was 12.

166
00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:58.801
Pa two years later, leaving
me to raise the family.

167
00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:01.804
Now, Calamity.

168
00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:04.974
You're gonna wanna
write this down.

169
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.745
Oh, well, is it...
is it story time now?

170
00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:11.480
Sure is. And I'll be sure
to use small words for you.

171
00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:14.316
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Now,

172
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.361
Calamity.

173
00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.993
That name was given to
me by good old Cap Egan

174
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.537
when we was fighting Indians
just south of Goose Creek.

175
00:12:27.037 --> 00:12:29.832
They ambushed us about
a mile from our post.

176
00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:33.544
Cap Egan takes an arrow and nearly
dies twice falling off his steed,

177
00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:37.047
and I snatched him up before they
could maul him and took one in the gut.

178
00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.841
When we got back to camp,

179
00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:43.280
he got the whole
regiment together,

180
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.847
made a toast.

181
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:50.686
To Calamity Jane, Queen
of the High Plain.

182
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.814
Or some shit like that.

183
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:57.735
Memory gets a little murky
on account of the whiskey.

184
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.029
Sounds like bullshit to me.

185
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.200
[Jane] Hurts worse than a conversation
with a priest when it rains.

186
00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:06.076
Oh, that's a nice one.

187
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.246
[Mason] You ever
get tired of it?

188
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:12.583
Imagine a lot comes along
with a name like Calamity.

189
00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:15.251
I suppose.

190
00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:16.879
[door squeaks]

191
00:13:17.004 --> 00:13:20.317
But now, history
doesn't remember Janes.

192
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:21.717
No, it don't.

193
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:25.054
Or Abigails.

194
00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.097
[Wild Bill] Based off
the beautiful voice,

195
00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:31.268
coach full of arrows tells me
that I'm in the right place.

196
00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:33.020
About time.

197
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.065
- Can I help you, sir?
- Backin' the fuck up

198
00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:37.691
would be a good start.

199
00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:39.902
[Abigail] Holy shit.

200
00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:42.571
Well, if it ain't
Wild Bill himself.

201
00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:45.115
Ooh, you guys have a collection

202
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:49.846
of real nasty folks
here, don't we? [Laughs]

203
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.956
Got no quarrel
with you as of yet.

204
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:54.708
- [Abigail] Mm, ooh.
- Or the law.

205
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:58.021
I'm just here to
see my wife-to-be.

206
00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:01.423
Aw. Ain't that sweet.

207
00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:04.468
Heard the coach got shot up. Just
wanted to make sure that you were...

208
00:14:04.593 --> 00:14:06.696
[Jane] I'm fine,

209
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.032
as I can be under
the circumstances.

210
00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:11.392
[gentle music playing]

211
00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:14.603
You smell good.

212
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.272
I smell like sweat.

213
00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:17.940
That's what I said.

214
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:23.612
You left this.

215
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:29.952
Aren't you gonna put it on?

216
00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:36.083
I got something else for you.

217
00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.252
Do, you remember

218
00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:42.131
that little plot of land
outside Lewis County?

219
00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.507
Place with the wildflowers?

220
00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:45.843
And the orchard with
the little apple trees.

221
00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.931
It's ours now.

222
00:14:52.349 --> 00:14:53.475
So what?

223
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:58.522
Wild Bill Hickok's just gonna settle
down and become a fuckin' farmer?

224
00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:02.318
That's exactly what
he's gonna do, with you.

225
00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:04.653
Maybe a few little
ones running around.

226
00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:06.655
[light chuckle]

227
00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:09.658
[music swells]

228
00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:11.952
- [Abigail] Ugh.
- [Bill and Jane kiss]

229
00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:22.171
Now, what trivial matter did
you arrest my wife-to-be for?

230
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:24.441
She got drunk and
robbed some ranchers.

231
00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:28.719
They were thieving wrestlers.
They besmirched my honor,

232
00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:30.512
and I wasn't drunk.

233
00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:32.556
Well, I can still
smell the whiskey.

234
00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.684
I'll talk to the
bellman in the mornin'.

235
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:38.854
We'll have you outta
here 'bout midday.

236
00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:41.190
When the times are getting dark,

237
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.734
and the night things
are growling at you,

238
00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:48.072
remember to lean on the good
work of the Lord for guidance.

239
00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:54.471
Nothing wrong with spreading
the word of the Lord.

240
00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:55.704
Yeah, well,

241
00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:59.208
we don't see too much of the
good Lord here in Deadwood.

242
00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:09.218
Promise you'll go straight to
sleep and wait for the magistrate.

243
00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:10.987
Of course.

244
00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:12.096
No drinking.

245
00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:15.891
No cards.

246
00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:21.730
I love you.

247
00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:31.281
No fuckin' cards,
Bill, I mean it.

248
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.243
[Bill] I heard you.
High noon tomorrow.

249
00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:39.349
- Deputy.
- No fuckin' cards, Bill.

250
00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.125
[chuckles]

251
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.260
What are you doin'
with that killer?

252
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.932
You and I did some killing earlier ourselves,
Deputy, or did you forget that already?

253
00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:59.703
That was different. We
was defending ourselves.

254
00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:00.978
[Jane] Right.

255
00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:05.107
There is a darkness in his eyes.

256
00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:08.819
- Is that right?
- You're different.

257
00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:14.158
You ain't got what he got.

258
00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.661
You sure about that?

259
00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:27.463
You don't know shit about me.

260
00:17:27.588 --> 00:17:28.797
[laughs]

261
00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.594
[Abigail laughs]

262
00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:37.806
[Jane] There's good in Bill.

263
00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:41.310
He just needs a little
salvation is all.

264
00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:43.353
[Abigail laughs]

265
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.855
Salvation?

266
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.691
For people like us? Uh-uh.

267
00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:51.254
There ain't nothing
waiting in the sky

268
00:17:51.278 --> 00:17:54.531
- for savages and outlaws.
- [ominous music playing]

269
00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:58.202
Ain't that right,
lawman? [Laughs]

270
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.039
[ominous music continues]

271
00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:03.165
[Abigail laughs]

272
00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:08.170
[Abigail groans] Go on.

273
00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:16.553
[ragtime music playing]

274
00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:18.918
[people laughing] - [woman]
Get your asses back upstairs

275
00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:20.784
and pay what you owe!

276
00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:24.561
- [woman grunting]
- [men laughing]

277
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:26.897
[indistinct chatter]

278
00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:33.194
Mmm.

279
00:18:33.737 --> 00:18:36.132
Ah, keep 'em coming, sweetheart.

280
00:18:36.156 --> 00:18:37.741
- [laughs]
- [glasses clink]

281
00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:39.243
- [loud slap]
- [patron grunts]

282
00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:44.748
- [chair squeaks]
- [doors creak]

283
00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:46.750
And on the seventh day,

284
00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:50.087
the good Lord sent
his favorite son

285
00:18:51.755 --> 00:18:53.882
to rob you bastards blind.

286
00:18:57.719 --> 00:18:58.846
Whiskey.

287
00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:04.059
- [cork pops]
- [whiskey pouring]

288
00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:07.187
Thank you.

289
00:19:09.356 --> 00:19:12.734
Ain't no room for you at
this table, Wild Bill.

290
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.111
Jack McCall,

291
00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:19.342
is that, uh, slavin',

292
00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:21.076
whorin' brother Baron of yours

293
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:23.513
still making his living
off the backs of others?

294
00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:26.790
If you know my brother, you
know he don't take kindly

295
00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:28.750
to you insulting our name.

296
00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.211
Yeah, I reckon I
don't give a fuck.

297
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:38.093
I'm afraid my man
Riley's sitting there.

298
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.432
[chair slides]

299
00:19:45.642 --> 00:19:46.768
[thuds]

300
00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:51.773
[Bill sighs]

301
00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:17.465
Ten.

302
00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.802
[dramatic music playing]

303
00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:28.936
[Jack] Raise.

304
00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:31.312
Twenty.

305
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:42.281
Forty.

306
00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.172
[hand thuds]

307
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:04.345
Well

308
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:10.060
two pair. Aces high.

309
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.982
- [group laughing]
- [chuckles]

310
00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:19.361
[gun cocks] - You're fuckin'
crazy, just like they say.

311
00:21:20.195 --> 00:21:22.406
What's the most you
ever lost on a hand?

312
00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:26.868
What's the most you
ever lost on a hand?

313
00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:29.472
'Cause my Colt

314
00:21:29.496 --> 00:21:33.542
has been trained at your
nuts since I sat down.

315
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:36.920
Now, from what I can gather,

316
00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:38.922
that's not a Colt.

317
00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:43.593
And if it ain't, I don't think
I'd trust it in a gunfight.

318
00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:47.931
Now your bullet could go to
the rig, could go to the left.

319
00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:53.061
That thing could backfire, hit you right
in the face, which from where I'm sitting,

320
00:21:54.021 --> 00:21:55.731
well, that'd be a
fuckin' improvement.

321
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.568
[gun cocks] - [barkeep] Only man
here allowed to dirty these floors

322
00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:01.570
is my late husband.

323
00:22:09.202 --> 00:22:13.040
Well, since the lady says so,

324
00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:16.519
and since I'm in
such a good mood...

325
00:22:16.543 --> 00:22:18.920
[gun clacks]

326
00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:21.923
I'm gonna let you live.

327
00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:26.136
[hand thuds]

328
00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:30.533
[footsteps tapping]

329
00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:33.935
Jack, Jack, Jack, you...
you're forgetting something.

330
00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:36.205
I-I don't reckon I did.

331
00:22:36.229 --> 00:22:38.565
You-you forgot to say thank you.

332
00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:44.321
- What?
- You forgot to say thank you.

333
00:22:45.155 --> 00:22:48.283
Thank you, Wild Bill.

334
00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:52.287
Thank you for letting me live.

335
00:22:58.168 --> 00:23:02.130
Thank you, Wild Bill,

336
00:23:02.255 --> 00:23:04.299
- for letting me...
- [Bill laughs] Oh, shit.

337
00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:06.277
- You're really gonna do it.
- [group laughing]

338
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:09.179
Oh, I'm just fuckin'
with you. Thank you.

339
00:23:11.014 --> 00:23:13.409
[group laughing]

340
00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:14.476
Okay.

341
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.022
- [grunts]
- [people gasp]

342
00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:24.653
[patron] Easy, easy.

343
00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:32.536
[tense music playing]

344
00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:09.656
[Mason] Let me
ask you something.

345
00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:15.245
As an outlaw, what would
you say you fear the most?

346
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:17.830
Mmm.

347
00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:22.210
I'd say dumb fuckin' questions
are at the top of the list.

348
00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:24.086
Death?

349
00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:27.048
No. Died once already.

350
00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.593
Drowned in the Platte River.

351
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.679
Just out for a swim, were you?

352
00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:37.225
A hundred miles working
for General Crook.

353
00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:39.662
Doc said I collapsed and died.

354
00:24:39.686 --> 00:24:43.690
Fourteen days later, I
wake up in the hospital.

355
00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:46.902
Sounds like a miracle. [Spits]

356
00:24:47.068 --> 00:24:50.280
Is that what you're gonna
put in your book? Hmm?

357
00:24:51.114 --> 00:24:52.616
A miracle?

358
00:24:52.782 --> 00:24:54.910
Sure. Why not?

359
00:24:55.785 --> 00:24:57.913
Miracle's just another
word for dumb luck.

360
00:24:58.038 --> 00:25:00.582
You don't believe in God?

361
00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:03.752
You honestly think it'd
make a difference if I did?

362
00:25:05.086 --> 00:25:06.296
[Mason] I do.

363
00:25:07.964 --> 00:25:10.467
- [door creaks]
- My rifle.

364
00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:13.094
It's Wild Bill.

365
00:25:13.261 --> 00:25:14.930
Jack McCall blew his
fuckin' brains out

366
00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:16.806
- all over the saloon.
- Bullshit.

367
00:25:18.975 --> 00:25:20.769
I've seen it myself.

368
00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:23.104
The undertaker's got
his body already.

369
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:24.208
Let me out.

370
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:25.774
[gun clacks]

371
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:28.276
Now, I'm gonna go make
sure he doesn't skip town.

372
00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:29.803
You stay here and
keep a look out.

373
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:33.448
- Are you sure you don't need...
- Stay here.

374
00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:35.718
[Abigail] Oh, shit.
You really think

375
00:25:35.742 --> 00:25:40.789
Rick knows Jack McCall
killed Wild Bill Hickok?

376
00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:42.165
Ooh. [Laughs]

377
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.459
Wild Bill shot my friend's uncle

378
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:47.504
outside of Promise, Nevada,
without no provoking.

379
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:50.090
He got what was coming to him.

380
00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:58.640
Maybe that's just God's
way of evening things out.

381
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.143
- [laughs]
- [Jane screams]

382
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:04.521
- Jane! Hey!
- [grunting]

383
00:26:04.646 --> 00:26:08.316
- [groans]
- Oh, no, pretty face.

384
00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:12.529
- [breathing heavily]
- [keys jingle]

385
00:26:12.654 --> 00:26:15.115
[grunting]

386
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.493
[grunts]

387
00:26:23.164 --> 00:26:26.209
[laughs]

388
00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:27.376
I saved your life.

389
00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:29.212
Thank you very much.

390
00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:31.172
[laughs] Oh. Ahem.

391
00:26:32.882 --> 00:26:34.467
[grunts, laughs]

392
00:26:35.635 --> 00:26:37.304
Ah, don't take it personal.

393
00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:44.227
[grunts]

394
00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:45.687
You know what I wish?

395
00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:49.524
I wish it were me
that had done it.

396
00:26:51.192 --> 00:26:52.527
Could you imagine?

397
00:26:54.738 --> 00:26:55.738
Me

398
00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:00.243
The man who killed Wild Bill?

399
00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:05.874
[laughs] Oh.

400
00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:08.376
You're a dead man.

401
00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:11.212
Oh, what was that?

402
00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:13.673
[mumbles]

403
00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:17.218
Come... come again?

404
00:27:17.844 --> 00:27:19.387
[grunts]

405
00:27:19.554 --> 00:27:20.722
[Lance] Okay, calm.

406
00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:23.099
[mumbles]

407
00:27:23.224 --> 00:27:26.436
- [giggles]
- C-calm, calm, calm, calm now.

408
00:27:26.603 --> 00:27:27.997
Okay.

409
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.230
[lock clinks]

410
00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:31.107
- [Jane grunts]
- [door squeaks]

411
00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:32.668
- [Lance grunts]
- [thuds]

412
00:27:32.692 --> 00:27:34.611
Oh, rawr.

413
00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:39.532
[Jane grunting]

414
00:27:42.535 --> 00:27:44.746
- Night-night.
- [keys jingle]

415
00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:49.459
[Jane grunting]

416
00:27:51.628 --> 00:27:53.713
- [Jane continues grunting]
- [giggling]

417
00:27:56.257 --> 00:27:59.594
[Mason sighs] You'll
hang after trial.

418
00:27:59.719 --> 00:28:01.471
Don't throw your life away.

419
00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:05.266
What life?

420
00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:06.935
- Jane!
- [metal clanks]

421
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.204
[Abigail cheers]

422
00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:10.105
She has got more grit

423
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.041
than a Texas tornado, don't she?

424
00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:13.149
[keys jingle]

425
00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:14.484
Fuck.

426
00:28:19.989 --> 00:28:22.784
- [door creaks]
- Now, when you put this part

427
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:26.389
in your little book, make
sure you get my name right.

428
00:28:26.413 --> 00:28:28.557
It's Abigail, with two "I's."

429
00:28:28.581 --> 00:28:30.625
- [grunts]
- Ooh!

430
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.337
You're a thoroughbred,
aren't you, lawman? [Laughs]

431
00:28:34.504 --> 00:28:36.464
[keys jingle, thud]

432
00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:37.799
[Abigail] Mm.

433
00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:48.476
[Mason] Ah, come on.

434
00:28:51.354 --> 00:28:53.249
[people chattering]

435
00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:57.485
[thunder rumbles]

436
00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:01.948
[bottles rattling]

437
00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:07.162
What you got there, hmm?

438
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:09.831
Whiskey, for the hotel.

439
00:29:10.874 --> 00:29:12.709
[bottles clink]

440
00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:13.835
[cork pops]

441
00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:22.051
- Mm.
- [bottles clink]

442
00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.887
You seen Jack McCall?

443
00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:25.846
No.

444
00:29:26.181 --> 00:29:28.641
Do you know where
maybe I could find him?

445
00:29:29.642 --> 00:29:32.687
Last time he came through here,
he stayed at the Stone Inn.

446
00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:37.233
How about I come
and see you tonight?

447
00:29:37.358 --> 00:29:38.359
I don't think so.

448
00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:41.362
It's gonna be real
busy at the saloon.

449
00:29:43.865 --> 00:29:45.867
[rain pattering]

450
00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:48.369
I'll see you tonight.

453
00:30:13.061 --> 00:30:14.062
Come on.

454
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:24.072
Where are they?

455
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.870
What happened to him?

456
00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:35.184
Calamity Jane.

457
00:30:35.208 --> 00:30:37.085
I left you ten minutes ago.

458
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:40.964
Keys?

459
00:30:47.136 --> 00:30:48.471
[keys jingle]

460
00:30:48.638 --> 00:30:51.474
[eerie music playing]

461
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:54.870
Hmm, won't be needing that.

462
00:30:54.894 --> 00:30:55.979
Mmm.

463
00:30:59.774 --> 00:31:02.652
Careful now. You're about
to get in bed with the man

464
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:06.155
who killed frontier
legend Wild Bill Hickok.

465
00:31:06.322 --> 00:31:08.050
- [giggles]
- [door slams]

466
00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:10.994
You son of a bitch! [Grunts]

467
00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:14.414
[both grunting]

468
00:31:21.921 --> 00:31:24.007

[Jane screaming]

472
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:34.517
- I got money.
- You think this is about money?

473
00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:36.579
[strained] Yeah, well,
Wild Bill's dead.

474
00:31:36.603 --> 00:31:40.982

- Get outta my way!
- You gonna execute me

480
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.599
- like you did Sheriff Griggs?
- Jack shot Griggs.

481
00:31:56.623 --> 00:32:00.001
Step aside, Deputy.
He dies, here and now.

482
00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:03.379
He'll stand trial
and he'll be hung.

483
00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:04.547
He shot Bill.

484
00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:08.718
Just let me help you. Please,
just put down the gun.

485
00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:10.845
I gotta take you back in.

486
00:32:11.387 --> 00:32:12.948
You say you didn't
kill the sheriff?

487
00:32:12.972 --> 00:32:15.224
Well, you can tell
that to the judge.

488
00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:20.688
[Jane] He shot Bill.

489
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:26.694

[crowd chattering]

494
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:41.084
Fuck.

whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:32:51.177 --> 00:32:53.096
- [woman] Come on, this way.
- Move.

498
00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:00.395
Hey, look who it is. We
came to break you out.

499
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.065
Sorry to ruin it for you, baby
brother. Waited as long as I could.

500
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.834
What the hell are we
supposed to do now?

501
00:33:05.858 --> 00:33:09.904
Well, first I'm
gonna get me a drink

502
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:12.907
and then I'm sure we'll figure
something out, won't we?

503
00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:15.243
- [horse snorts]
- Come on now, let's go.

[horse snorts]

507
00:33:45.398 --> 00:33:48.943
Surveyor told me this place
belongs to Wild Bill Hickok.

508
00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:59.287
Ran into a couple
ranchers this morning.

509
00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:01.956
Said they saw you
heading up this way.

510
00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.128
Jane?

511
00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:16.012
I'm coming in.

512
00:34:18.806 --> 00:34:20.641
I don't wanna shoot you

513
00:34:20.808 --> 00:34:22.643

[gun cocks] - [Jane] Make
a noise and your dead

525
00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:26.809
before you hit the ground.

526
00:36:26.976 --> 00:36:28.769
You the gravedigger?

527
00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:29.895
Yes, ma'am.

528
00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:31.606
Do I need to worry about you

529
00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:33.482
trying to stuff me in a box?

530
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.903
I don't do the
killings around here.

531
00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:41.156
He's

532
00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:43.784
he's one of them?

533
00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:46.453
Bill?

534
00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:50.333
This one here.

[footsteps tapping]

536
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.368
Oh, you cleaned
him up real nice.

537
00:37:25.534 --> 00:37:26.702
You knew him?

538
00:37:27.286 --> 00:37:29.163
Clothes. Where are his clothes?

539
00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:33.334
Uh, we burned 'em. That's...
that's... that's tradition.

540
00:37:33.459 --> 00:37:35.044
[Jane] Did he have
anything on him?

541
00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:38.130
No, ma'am. Not by the time
he got to me, he didn't.

542
00:37:41.717 --> 00:37:43.177
Can you give us a moment?

543
00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:47.390
- [Jane sniffles]
- [footsteps tapping]

544
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:51.519
[gun clacks]

545
00:37:58.526 --> 00:37:59.526
[sniffles]

546
00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:03.364
[softly] I love you too.

547
00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:16.002
Can you do me a
favor, gravedigger?

548
00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:21.483
On his tombstone,

549
00:38:21.507 --> 00:38:22.883
can you write

550
00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:26.095
that he was a decent man?

551
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:30.433
Was he?

552
00:38:30.599 --> 00:38:31.892
He wanted to be.

553
00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:36.397
That's got to account
for something, right?

554
00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:46.532
May I ask who's
makin' the request?

555
00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.244
His wife.

556
00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:55.916
- [fire crackling]
- [coyotes howling]

557
00:38:56.042 --> 00:38:59.462
[harmonica plays]

558
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:14.143
[knife scraping]

559
00:39:14.268 --> 00:39:17.313
You know, I've been
thinking about what I'd do

560
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.273
if I had found
myself a gold mine.

561
00:39:19.398 --> 00:39:21.275
Yeah, you're thinking, were you?

562
00:39:22.735 --> 00:39:25.613
Well, I figured first
thing I'd do is,

563
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.990
I'd buy myself a
brand-new Winchester,

564
00:39:28.115 --> 00:39:29.718
- some land...
- [knife scraping]

565
00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:31.952
and a whole goddamn lot of
them fancy Scottish cattle

566
00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:33.662
like Old Mr. Foster had.

567
00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:37.500
What'd you do, Abigail?

568
00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:41.730
If you had a gold mine, I'd
kill you and take all your gold.

569
00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:43.172
- No.
- [laughs]

570
00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:44.900
That's not what I was saying.

571
00:39:44.924 --> 00:39:48.469
West's all one big
rotten fuckin' drain.

572
00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:52.264
[knife scraping]

573
00:39:57.478 --> 00:39:59.313
- [gun cocks]
- You sure he's coming?

574
00:39:59.438 --> 00:40:01.190
Uh, he said he was coming, yeah.

575
00:40:01.315 --> 00:40:03.526
And he said he was
gonna pay us 400 a piece

576
00:40:03.651 --> 00:40:05.152
to take him to see his brother?

577
00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:06.654
Yeah, that's what he said, 400.

578
00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:08.489
- Five hundred.
- Whoa.

579
00:40:08.614 --> 00:40:10.032
[tense music plays]

580
00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:12.701
Holy shit.

581
00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:15.663
If it ain't Jack McCall himself.

582
00:40:17.164 --> 00:40:18.934
This is the man you
was talking about?

583
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:21.001
Uh-huh. That's him.

584
00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:22.878
[laughs]

585
00:40:23.045 --> 00:40:25.047
You're fixing to
pay us 500 a piece

586
00:40:25.172 --> 00:40:26.882
to take you to see your brother?

587
00:40:27.007 --> 00:40:28.676
- That's right.
- [Abigail] Why?

588
00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:30.112
Passing through the Badlands

589
00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:32.447
and need some
protection, is all.

590
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:33.973
You interested?

591
00:40:36.016 --> 00:40:38.394
If you got the gold, we are.

592
00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:44.066
There's a thousand
in gold right there.

593
00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:47.129
My brother will give you the
rest when you take me to him.

594
00:40:47.153 --> 00:40:50.072
- Mm. Is that right?
- [clicks tongue]

595
00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:53.075
- [tense music playing]
- [coyotes howling]

596
00:40:57.663 --> 00:41:01.417
Put 'em down. We
leave at first light.

597
00:41:04.378 --> 00:41:06.714
- Come on.
- [horse snorts]

598
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:09.818
And I swear to God, brother, if you
play the harmonica one more time,

599
00:41:09.842 --> 00:41:11.510
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

600
00:41:14.555 --> 00:41:16.765
[knife scraping]

601
00:41:16.932 --> 00:41:18.726
[hammer banging]

602
00:41:19.226 --> 00:41:21.061
- [hammer thuds]
- [undertaker exhales]

603
00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:22.605
What happens now?

604
00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:25.733
Now...

605
00:41:27.902 --> 00:41:30.070
I'm gonna kill Jack McCall.

606
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:35.409
You know, a

607
00:41:36.577 --> 00:41:38.454
a man wiser than me once said,

608
00:41:38.621 --> 00:41:40.956
if you go to embark on
a quest for revenge,

609
00:41:41.123 --> 00:41:44.710
you better build two graves.

610
00:41:46.128 --> 00:41:48.714
One for them and
one for yourself.

611
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:52.468
That just sounds like a
lot of fuckin' digging.

612
00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:56.055
You even know where he's headed?

613
00:41:56.597 --> 00:41:59.600
I hear his brother runs a
bunch of gold mines out east.

614
00:42:00.976 --> 00:42:05.147
Well, the only way to reach
those gold mines out east

615
00:42:05.272 --> 00:42:06.941
is to travel through
the Badlands.

616
00:42:07.107 --> 00:42:09.276
Gangs covering that territory.

617
00:42:09.443 --> 00:42:11.820
Scalp-hunting
ex-Confederate devils

618
00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:15.616
that make the savages
look like English royalty.

619
00:42:17.618 --> 00:42:21.956
Why do I get the funny feeling
you might know another way?

620
00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:23.457
'Cause I might.

621
00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:27.562
What'll it cost me?

622
00:42:27.586 --> 00:42:30.422
- Whatever you think's fair.
- How does it work?

623
00:42:32.925 --> 00:42:34.468
We just go right on through.

624
00:42:34.593 --> 00:42:36.679
Right on through the
ex-Confederate devils

625
00:42:36.845 --> 00:42:39.848
that make the savages
look like English royalty?

626
00:42:40.015 --> 00:42:41.809
[laughs]

627
00:42:41.934 --> 00:42:44.144
Undertaker gets a free pass.

628
00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:47.356
I gotta go through there
to pick up the product.

629
00:42:53.195 --> 00:42:54.989
I really am gonna
kill Jack McCall,

630
00:42:55.114 --> 00:42:56.782
and you better
not get in my way.

631
00:42:57.616 --> 00:43:00.119
You pull the trigger,
I'll build the coffin.

632
00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:10.838
[carriage rattling]

633
00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:15.342
[thunder rumbles]

634
00:43:18.137 --> 00:43:21.724
Calamity Jane is wanted for
the death of Sheriff Griggs.

635
00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:25.227
Jack McCall is wanted for the
death of Wild Bill Hickok.

636
00:43:25.394 --> 00:43:28.355
Two fugitives, three bodies,

637
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:31.233
and one of them our own.

638
00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:35.696
Hell of a night,
even for Deadwood.

639
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:43.471
This is a hunt. We are bringing
them back to the hangman.

640
00:43:43.495 --> 00:43:46.582
If we don't kill them ourselves,
well we don't let 'em go either.

641
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:49.918
We bring 'em back
here for justice.

642
00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:52.755
As the acting sheriff,
I have been authorized

643
00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:56.216
to deputize you men to carry
out the law of this land.

644
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.404
Will nobody here stand
for Sheriff Briggs?

645
00:44:35.422 --> 00:44:36.590
Anyone else?

646
00:44:44.723 --> 00:44:46.034
You barely look old
enough to drink.

647
00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:47.535
You know how to wield an iron?

648
00:44:47.559 --> 00:44:49.561
No age requirement on
doing what's right.

649
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:57.069
You know how to use that thing?

650
00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.446
I've been shooting
since I was nine.

651
00:45:09.998 --> 00:45:10.999
Anyone else?

652
00:45:13.794 --> 00:45:17.005
Three of y'all.
That's your posse?

653
00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:27.683
I saw Calamity Jane.
She's with the undertaker,

654
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:29.518
and they're headed
for the Badlands.

655
00:45:29.643 --> 00:45:32.020
- [tense music swells]
- [indistinct chatter]

656
00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:37.359
Well, get some shut-eye.
We ride at first light.

657
00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:39.695
[thunder rumbles]

658
00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:49.872
[wind whistling]

[eerie music playing]

- [horse neighs]
- [panting]

661
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:29.328
Find it helps keep
the devil at bay,

662
00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:32.372
at least until morning.

663
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:34.082
Devil ain't real.

664
00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:35.918
Probably God neither.

665
00:46:37.878 --> 00:46:39.713
The only thing
that's real is pain.

666
00:46:39.838 --> 00:46:41.882
I hate to be the
bearer of bad news,

667
00:46:42.007 --> 00:46:44.426
but there's a long fucking
line of people ahead of you

668
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:46.988
with a bone to pick
with the Almighty.

669
00:46:47.012 --> 00:46:48.055
[Jane] Yeah.

670
00:46:49.264 --> 00:46:51.993
What'd you lose that's got
you so pissed off at God?

671
00:46:52.017 --> 00:46:55.103
[fire crackling]

672
00:47:14.748 --> 00:47:17.626
The fire's a lot less
merciful than a bullet.

673
00:47:20.295 --> 00:47:23.757
[fire crackling continues]

674
00:47:24.299 --> 00:47:25.759
Even if you get your revenge,

675
00:47:25.884 --> 00:47:28.095
you're gonna be
dealing with the pain.

676
00:47:30.222 --> 00:47:31.807
You can trust me on that.

677
00:47:35.269 --> 00:47:38.272
[ominous music plays]

678
00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:41.775
[train whistle blows]

679
00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:45.487

[gentle violin music playing]

681

[horses snorting]

682
00:48:04.673 --> 00:48:06.800
- [undertaker] Whoa.
- [horses snorting]

683
00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:09.845
- [gun clicks]
- No.

684
00:48:11.763 --> 00:48:13.432
It's the way out here.

685
00:48:15.475 --> 00:48:17.519
It's the way of
the world, really.

686
00:48:20.188 --> 00:48:21.857
Welcome to the Badlands.

687
00:48:25.777 --> 00:48:27.195
[horses neigh]

688
00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:29.531
[tense music playing]

689
00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:38.289
Whoa.

690
00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:42.169
[shouting in distance]

691
00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:44.880
[guns blasting faintly]

692
00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:47.275
Looks like it's
time to play dead.

693
00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:50.135
[chattering in distance]

694
00:49:01.021 --> 00:49:02.564
[birds chirping]

695
00:49:07.402 --> 00:49:09.130
Hiya.

696
00:49:09.154 --> 00:49:12.467
[carriage rattles]

697
00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:14.743
[tense music playing]

698
00:49:24.044 --> 00:49:27.255
Whoa, chief. That's far enough.

699
00:49:29.716 --> 00:49:31.718
State your business.

700
00:49:33.095 --> 00:49:35.722
Got a body to deliver
to Willow Creek.

701
00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:44.606
Gun or the gold. What'll it be?

702
00:49:49.361 --> 00:49:50.445
[guns cock]

703
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:51.738
Don't mind them.

704
00:49:51.905 --> 00:49:52.906
They get a little excited

705
00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:54.783
seeing fresh heads roll in.

706
00:50:00.622 --> 00:50:03.583
What do you think a scalp like
that will fetch in market, boys?

707
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:11.091
Ain't enough.

708
00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:15.303
What do you mean, sir?

709
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.305
I mean, it ain't fuckin' enough.

710
00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:19.474
Rusty said it was two pieces.

711
00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:21.143
Oh, Rusty said?

712
00:50:21.268 --> 00:50:22.769
Rusty.

713
00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:27.816
Can you hear me, Rusty?

714
00:50:28.775 --> 00:50:30.110
Rusty?

715
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.780
Shit, I don't think he can
hear much of anything anymore.

716
00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:38.285
Look, all I'm fixing to do is
deliver a man to his loved ones.

717
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:40.495
You're lucky we're out
here looking out for you.

718
00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.456
You need roughnecks
like us out here

719
00:50:42.622 --> 00:50:44.833
protecting your interests.

720
00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:47.836
'Cause these Badlands
become lawless,

721
00:50:48.336 --> 00:50:50.964
filled with nothing
but fuckin' savages.

You got a live one back the?

725
00:50:58.513 --> 00:51:00.932
Sometimes the pine warps.

726

- [box thumping]
- [breathing heavily]

727
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.980
Let's take a look at

Here, okay?

746
00:52:25.392 --> 00:52:26.768
Why are you doing this?

747
00:52:26.893 --> 00:52:28.228
I need a ride.

748
00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:30.730
Bullshit.

749
00:52:32.357 --> 00:52:33.775
It's 'cause of this.

750
00:52:35.193 --> 00:52:37.571
Well, don't go telling nobody.

751
00:52:37.737 --> 00:52:40.282
- [undertaker chuckles]
- Let me see.

[groans]

753
00:52:42.784 --> 00:52:44.119
Wait, just stop moving.

754
00:52:44.286 --> 00:52:46.788
- I'm trying to stop the...
- Okay, okay.

755
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.128
Just let me enjoy the stars.

[gentle music swells]

759
00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:28.455
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

760
00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:33.001
I always thought when
this moment came,

761
00:53:33.126 --> 00:53:34.836
I'd be scared, but...

762
00:53:37.005 --> 00:53:39.299
[light chuckle] I'm not.

763
00:53:39.424 --> 00:53:40.967
Shh.

764
00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:42.344
Save your strength.

765
00:53:43.637 --> 00:53:45.931
All we can do is try, you know?

766
00:53:48.808 --> 00:53:50.101
That's all we got.

767
00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.981
It's just knowing that

768
00:53:58.276 --> 00:54:00.421
when the end comes at some point

769
00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:02.113
in your life, you

770
00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:05.992
try to do some good.

771
00:54:11.831 --> 00:54:12.831
Well,

772
00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:16.962
maybe if you're lucky, the
good outweighs the bad.

773
00:54:25.178 --> 00:54:28.723
You know, they say I swam
100 miles in freezing river?

774
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.893
- I heard that.
- [chuckles, sniffles]

775
00:54:32.018 --> 00:54:33.353
Well, I...

776
00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:38.566
I, uh, I never swam the Platte.

777
00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:45.699
Technically, I did, because I
fell in drunk, damn near drowned.

778

[both laugh]

779
00:54:50.078 --> 00:54:51.871

still got time.

[both laugh]

781
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.977
From what I heard though,
it's pretty fuckin' cold.

00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:59.379
[both laugh]

783
00:54:59.504 --> 00:55:00.505
Yeah.

Nope.

806
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.592
Tracks are fresh.

807
00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:55.054

827
00:59:28.356 --> 00:59:29.816
You gonna give him to me?

828
00:59:31.818 --> 00:59:33.194
I'm not.

829
00:59:33.778 --> 00:59:37.115
- Why?
- Well, for one thing, attitude.

830
00:59:38.116 --> 00:59:39.617
I'm just kiddin'.

831
00:59:40.201 --> 00:59:43.538
He has gold. Lots
and lots of gold.

832
00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:47.834
Well, you know, some things
are more important than gold.

833
00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:51.296
[laughs] You're funny.

834

[heavy breathing]

838
01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:12.859
We got the place surrounded.

839
01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.488
We're here for the
outlaw, Jack McCall,

840
01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:21.367
and Calamity Jane.

841
01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:28.207
Both wanted for murder.
Nobody has to die here today.

842
01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:34.213
A shot like that, Wild
Bill'd still be alive.

843
01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:36.257
I'ma kill you, Jack.

844
01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.426
You kill him, you hang for sure.

845
01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:43.264
There's two types
of people, Jack!

846
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:46.517
Runners and gunners.

847
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.395

Jack killed your sheriff.

857
01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:32.206
Killed a lot of people in my time, never
claimed that I didn't kill one that I did.

858
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.731
Jack pulled that trigger,

859
01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:36.484
not me.

- You got any more bullets?

862
01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.840
How'd that bullet
taste, shit bag?

863
01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:00.925
It's just a scratch.

864
01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.514
- What happened?
- Three of them took off, on horseback.

865
01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:09.308

Okay, okay, okay! Okay, they
headed just north of here.

There's a camp. [Panting]

It's Jack's brother's new mines.

you! I'll tell you on the map.

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:11.639
Fire's warmer here. That's all.

[grunts]

896
01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:20.731
Can you tell me what's taking
you so long to write that book?

897
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:23.818
What's it about?

898
01:04:25.152 --> 01:04:27.381
[birds calling]

899
01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:30.283
An outlaw tryin' to do right.

900
01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:32.785
[scoffs] Good luck with that.

901
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:34.555
Yeah. Luck ain't got
nothing to do with it.

902
01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:36.455
Maybe your problem is
that everybody's got

903
01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.457
some good and evil in him.

904
01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:41.669
[coyote howls in distance]

905
01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:43.230
I ain't gotta worry
about you tomorrow, do I?

906
01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.631
Bring back Jack in
handcuffs, not a coffin.

907
01:04:45.756 --> 01:04:47.442
What if it was your wife
who he shot in the back?

908
01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:49.468
- I ain't got a wife.
- Mm.

909
01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:53.180
Not anymore.

910
01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:56.642
What happened?

911
01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:03.941
Seven years ago when I was away
coverin' the war for Harper's,

912
01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:08.422
gang of bandits
ambushed our town.

913
01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:10.323
[gentle music playing]

914
01:05:10.448 --> 01:05:12.700
That's when I gave up writing
and took off for the law.

915
01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:15.202
You didn't think about
riding out and killing him?

916
01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:16.704
I tried to find 'em.

917
01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:20.833
All I found was the
bottom of a bottle.

918
01:05:24.712 --> 01:05:27.107
Is that why you
picked up the badge?

919
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:28.841
Revenge?

920
01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:34.555
I was drinking myself to death
when I found myself in debt.

921
01:05:34.722 --> 01:05:37.558
I woke up one morning staring
straight into the eyes of a killer.

922
01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:39.685
I must have pissed off someone.

923
01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:43.564
He pulled the trigger.

924
01:05:45.524 --> 01:05:46.734
Gun misfired.

925
01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:51.906
Right there and then, I decided
it was a sign from my wife.

926
01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.494
To do good.

927

I'm going.

932
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.801
Somethin' doesn't feel right.

933
01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:57.596
Now why the hell you go and
say a thing like that? Hmm?

934
01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.098
That's bad luck.

935
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.892
- We make our own luck.
- Mm-hmm.

936
01:07:08.899 --> 01:07:10.109
Well, I like her.

937
01:07:12.737 --> 01:07:13.988
She got spunk.

938
01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:18.075
She's got something.

[dramatic music playing]

947
01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:46.747
Shit.

948
01:08:50.584 --> 01:08:52.086
There's too many of 'em.

949
01:08:52.878 --> 01:08:55.381
- There's just more targets.
- Drop 'em.

950
01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:59.093
I said drop it.

951
01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.928
You're gonna have to make me.

952
01:09:05.891 --> 01:09:08.727
What are we waitin'
for? Stop wastin' time.

953
01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:10.771
- Let's just finish 'em.
- Ah-ah-ah.

954
01:09:11.730 --> 01:09:13.190
We're not savages here.

955
01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:16.670
Let's hear what these
good folk have to say

956
01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:18.672
before we go about
ending anyone's days.

957
01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:19.780
No, fuck that.

958
01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.448
I'm 'a shoot 'em myself.

959
01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.368
You will do not hi' of the sort.

960
01:09:29.748 --> 01:09:32.126
[sighs] Now,

961
01:09:33.794 --> 01:09:35.296
how can we help you, Sheriff?

962
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:36.589
You can hand over

963
01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:38.424
that murderin' son of a bitch.

964
01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:40.259
Well,

965
01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.762
you see, the problem is

966
01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:45.806
you're right.

967
01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:48.869
He is a son of a bitch.

968
01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:52.539
But that bitch was our mother,

969
01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:57.318
which makes this particular
murderin' piece of shit my brother.

970
01:09:57.484 --> 01:09:59.320
[Mason] The man you
are harborin' is wanted

971
01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.655
by the federal government
for the murder of Bill Hickok

972
01:10:01.822 --> 01:10:03.157
and Sheriff Charles Griggs.

973
01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:09.622
Well, now, it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.

974
01:10:09.788 --> 01:10:10.915
What you mean?

975
01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:14.335
These lands here aren't
under the jurisdiction

976
01:10:14.501 --> 01:10:17.838
of any government,
federal or otherwise.

977
01:10:18.839 --> 01:10:20.507
They're mine.

978
01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.677
He needs to stand
trial for what he did.

979
01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:26.847
I understand. I really do.

980
01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:32.311
But I'm afraid I
cannot let him hang.

981
01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:37.191
You see, Jack here, ahem,
tends to our Mama's grave

982
01:10:38.442 --> 01:10:39.860
for some reason I...

983
01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:43.822
I have never been able
to fuckin' fathom.

984
01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.159
He was always her favorite.

[guns click]

986
01:10:56.543 --> 01:10:57.836
I'll kill him.

987
01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:12.351
- They knocked up my leg.
- Mm-hmm. It hurt?

988
01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:15.896

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:40.379
It appears your negotiating
position has changed.

994
01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:47.886
Why don't you go ahead,
drop those weapons.

995
01:11:48.929 --> 01:11:50.097
Mm-hmm.

No!

[Mason screams]

1008
01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.116
I'll hold their fire.
You head for the horses.

You got spirit, girl.

1029
01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.524
I could use someone like you.

1030
01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:07.734
You could use a bath.

[Abigail laughs]

1032
01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:16.535

becoming of a lady.

That deed ain't in your name.

1038
01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:39.391
Yeah, well, you see,

1039
01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:41.101
that's where having
a relationship

1040
01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:44.104
with a Homestead Act
magistrate comes in handy.

1041
01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:46.231
That stolen property
belongs to me.

1042
01:14:46.356 --> 01:14:48.942
He who holds the
deed, holds the land.

1043
01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:52.237
I'm gonna enjoy spending

1045

the whole thing to the ground.

[tense music playing]

1047

I'm gonna enjoy killing you.

1048

This is how we take the West.

1049
01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:20.432
We take,

01:15:21.141 --> 01:15:23.268
we kill,

what's gonna happen.

I'm gonna take my deed back,

1055

1056
01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:40.285
and your brother.

1057
01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:45.791

on your fucking grave.

You shot her

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:41.221
This is it, gentlemen.

1072
01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:45.309
This is why we came out west.

1073
01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.896
Yes, it is true.

1074
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:52.691
We lost some good men.

1075
01:16:54.359 --> 01:16:56.862
But that just means
more share for us.

1076
01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:58.530
[group snickers]

1077
01:16:58.655 --> 01:17:00.741
We got ourselves one hell
of a haul here, boys.

1078
01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.200
[laughs]

1079
01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:04.161
However,

1080
01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:09.583
Uncle Sam knows it's
out here, same as us.

1081
01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:15.047
So that means we gotta
take it quick as we can.

1082
01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:17.549
[tense music plays]

1083
01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.719
Well, what are you waiting for?

1084
01:17:24.931 --> 01:17:28.894
Oh, and please,
mind the dynamite.

1085
01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:30.604
It's fuckin' expensive.

1086
01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:40.072
[Abigail] Look at you.

1087
01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:42.574
Calamity fuckin' Jane.

1088
01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:46.953
Defenseless. [Laughs]

1089
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.083
You know, you and
I, we're the same.

1090
01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:52.918
We're nothing alike.

1091
01:17:54.294 --> 01:17:55.962
You stabbed your
own fuckin' brother.

1092
01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:57.255
[gasps]

1093
01:17:58.048 --> 01:17:59.132
You made me.

1094
01:17:59.299 --> 01:18:01.218
I didn't make you do shit.

1095
01:18:03.303 --> 01:18:05.263
Mmm. [Exhales twice]

1096
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.699
You and I could've been friends.

1097
01:18:06.723 --> 01:18:07.808
Really?

1098
01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:09.601
Sure. Why not?

1099
01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:11.603
[laughs]

1100
01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:15.541
Oh.

1101
01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:18.443
You're too good, is that it?

1102
01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:20.612
No, I'm not good.

1103
01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:24.324
Not even close.

1104
01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:28.286
[laughs]

1105
01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:30.914
Wild Bill, gone.

1106
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:34.835
Acres of beautiful
country, gone.

1107
01:18:35.001 --> 01:18:36.837
Freedom, gone.

1108
01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:39.065
You ever shut the fuck up?

1109
01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:41.800
The legend of Calamity Jane,

1110
01:18:42.467 --> 01:18:45.804
it's gonna be forgotten like
a speck of dust in the desert.

1111
01:18:46.596 --> 01:18:48.574
But it's gonna
live on right here.

1112
01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:53.854
You see, you're gonna be
the one adding to my legend

1113
01:18:55.355 --> 01:18:56.773
right here.

1114
01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:00.652
[laughs]

1115
01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:04.823
Shut up or kill me,
you fuckin' imbecile.

1116
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.491
[Jane grunts]

1117
01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:13.290
[Bill] Hey, Jane, get up.

1118
01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:16.376
Get up.

1119
01:19:18.044 --> 01:19:20.881
Ain't nothin' left. [Cries]

1120
01:19:22.382 --> 01:19:23.675
I'm tired.

1121
01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.385
So you just gonna lay there

1122
01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:27.554
and die in the fuckin' weeds?

1123
01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:29.514
[sighs deeply]

1124
01:19:29.639 --> 01:19:31.391
There she is.

1125
01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:35.455
We were gonna get married.

1126
01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:37.731
Gonna live out our days

1127
01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:40.525
fat and happy on
a beautiful ranch

1128
01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:44.738
at the edge of some
God-forsaken little town.

1129
01:19:45.572 --> 01:19:47.407
Were you telling the truth?

1130
01:19:47.574 --> 01:19:49.409
[Bill] I only ever
told you the truth.

1131
01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:52.412
And the truth is,
right now [sniffs]

1132
01:19:53.246 --> 01:19:54.831
if you don't wake up,

1133
01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:59.044
you're gonna die.

1134
01:20:01.421 --> 01:20:04.549
Come on, stand up.

1135
01:20:04.674 --> 01:20:08.988
Stand up. Come on,
there you go. [Grunts]

1136
01:20:09.012 --> 01:20:10.764
Now, okay.

1137
01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:17.729
Tell me what your name is.

1138
01:20:19.731 --> 01:20:21.399
What's your name?

1139
01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:23.443
What's your name?

1140
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.946
[Abigail] Jane.

1141
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:28.174
Calamity Jane.

1142
01:20:28.198 --> 01:20:30.510
[eerie music continues]

1143
01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:33.453
[Abigail] Calamity Jane.

1144
01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:39.292
[groans, coughs]

1145
01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:41.086
Are you still here?

1146
01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:42.921
[grunts, spits]

1147
01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.132
[panting]

1148
01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:51.763
I grew up with four brothers,

1149
01:20:51.888 --> 01:20:53.974
and I got three left
on account of you.

1150
01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:58.770
You see around here, we
like to make things right.

1151
01:20:59.604 --> 01:21:01.773
Even, you know?

1152
01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:10.949
[laughs] An eye for an eye.

1153
01:21:11.074 --> 01:21:13.118
No, I didn't touch
your brother, I...

1154
01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:16.454
I just fucked up
his leg a little.

1155
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:20.333
[both laugh]

1156
01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:23.628
I might let you keep
one of your eyes.

1157
01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:26.006
That way you can still
make a decent wage

1158
01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:27.674
at the whore house.

1159
01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:32.679
You deserve your
revenge. I get that.

1160
01:21:32.804 --> 01:21:35.849
But there's something
you should know about me.

1161
01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:38.101
Hmm?

1162
01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:40.645
I can't work at a whore house.

1163
01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:44.858
And why is that?

1164
01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:48.820
I'm married.

1165
01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:52.365
- [punch smacks]
- [Abigail grunts]

1166
01:21:52.532 --> 01:21:54.200
[both shouting]

1167
01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:55.595
I'll get you!

1168
01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:59.205
[both grunting and shouting]

1169
01:22:03.293 --> 01:22:05.378
[Jane screams]

1170
01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:08.006

- [knife clinks]
- [Jane shouts]

1174
01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:17.223
[both panting]

1175
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:21.853
[Abigail whimpers, laughs]

1176
01:22:21.978 --> 01:22:24.397
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

1177
01:22:24.564 --> 01:22:25.857
Missed me.

1178
01:22:26.566 --> 01:22:27.566
[grunts]

1179
01:22:27.692 --> 01:22:32.697
[both yelling]

1180
01:22:34.532 --> 01:22:38.244
[both grunting and shouting]

1181
01:22:38.411 --> 01:22:40.914
[both panting, grunting]

1182
01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:44.477
- [laughs] Oh, Calamity Jane.
- [coughs]

1183
01:22:44.501 --> 01:22:48.254
- You know what I think?
- [coughing, panting]

1184
01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.483
I think I'm the real Calamity.

1185
01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:52.384
A more powerful version,

1186
01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:55.154
and the creature that's
lurking inside of you.

1187
01:22:55.178 --> 01:22:57.990
Well, guess what, Jane?
That monster's here,

1188
01:22:58.014 --> 01:22:59.891
and it's gonna tear
you fuckin' apart!

1189
01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:01.768
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1190
01:23:01.893 --> 01:23:03.663
[Abigail screams]

1191
01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:06.231
- [thuds]
- [grunts, pants]

1192
01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:09.776
- [blood squirts]
- [Jane pants, gasps]

1193
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.070
[Jane grunts, pants]

1194
01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:19.619
[grunting]

1195
01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:22.789

- [gun clicks]
- [shouts]

1197
01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:26.626
What the hell are
you doing here?

1198
01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:28.461
- [gun clicks]
- Rescuing you.

1199
01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:30.630
Timing could use some work.

1200
01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:33.258
Where the hell are they?

1201
01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:35.945
There's a bunch of 'em with
Jack and Baron up in the mine.

1202
01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:38.698
We're never gonna be able to
get 'em all. We need some help.

1203
01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:42.809
Your last posse left up to be desired on the
numbers side. Do you think you could get more?

1204
01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:46.271
- I'm not so sure.
- [horse neighs]

1205
01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:48.982
I have an idea.

1206
01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:54.880
Let's pick up the pace, boys.

1207
01:23:54.904 --> 01:23:56.614
I want this all
packed and loaded

1208
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.782
before sunrise tomorrow.

1209
01:23:57.907 --> 01:23:59.885
Come on now, let's move it.

1210
01:23:59.909 --> 01:24:02.954
- [miners chattering faintly]
- [horses neighing]

1211

1212
01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.083
[tense music playing]

1213
01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:12.839
Baron. You seeing this?

1214
01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:29.189
- Whoa.
- [horses snorting]

1215
01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:33.151
What do you want, lawman?

1216
01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:36.821
I'm here to arrest Jack McCall,

1217
01:24:36.946 --> 01:24:39.491
murder of Wild Bill Hickok.

1218
01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:41.117
You gonna come peacefully?

1219
01:24:41.659 --> 01:24:43.995
I admire the
commitment, I really do.

1220
01:24:44.704 --> 01:24:47.207
However, you appear to
be a bit shorthanded,

1221
01:24:47.832 --> 01:24:51.169
and I am afraid we're
gonna need that wagon.

1222
01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:52.837
Last chance, Baron.

1223
01:24:53.838 --> 01:24:56.341
- [tense music continues]
- [clicks tongue]

1224
01:25:01.387 --> 01:25:03.807
I like the odds on my side.

1225
01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:06.893
I think I can hear those odds!

1226
01:25:07.852 --> 01:25:10.814
[gunshots blasting]

1227
01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:15.652
Deputy here made me promise to give
you a chance to change your minds.

1228
01:25:18.738 --> 01:25:20.406
[men grunt]

1229

1232
01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:30.250
I'm here to arrest Jack McCall

1233
01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:32.210
for the murder of
Wild Bill Hickok.

1234
01:25:35.755 --> 01:25:37.048
Whatcha say, Baron?

1235
01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:46.349
[tense music continues]

1236
01:25:58.611 --> 01:25:59.779
Baron?

1237
01:26:11.916 --> 01:26:13.793
- Take him.
- [Jack] No!

1238
01:26:15.461 --> 01:26:16.713
They'll hang me.

1239
01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:19.299
They'll hang me!

1240
01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:21.527
They'll hang me!

1241
01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:23.970

[gunshots]

1246
01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:48.721
You trying to bring
this whole mine down?

1247
01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:51.497
If I die, I'm
taking you with me.

1248
01:26:51.664 --> 01:26:52.832
[bullet ricochets]

1249
01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:07.972
Jane!

1250
01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:14.479
[Jane] Guess we found
out you're a runner,

1251
01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:15.855
huh, Jack?

1252
01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:32.372
[cave rumbling]

1253
01:27:36.376 --> 01:27:37.376
[Jane grunts]

1254
01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:41.339
[Jack grunts]

1255
01:27:41.464 --> 01:27:42.465
[gun clicks]

1256
01:27:45.885 --> 01:27:47.053
[gun clicks]

1257
01:27:49.722 --> 01:27:51.015
[grunts, pants]

1258
01:28:01.025 --> 01:28:02.986
[panting]

1259
01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.832
[Jack] Fuck.

1260
01:28:23.256 --> 01:28:24.757
- [gunshot]
- [glass shatters]

1261
01:28:24.924 --> 01:28:25.985
[Jane] You feel that?

1262
01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:27.427
[gun cocks]

1263
01:28:28.928 --> 01:28:31.264
That cold trickling
up your spine.

1264
01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:32.265
[glass shatters]

1265
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:34.434
That's death comin' for you.

1266
01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:41.858
[both panting]

1267
01:28:46.571 --> 01:28:48.072
That's me.

1268
01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:50.676
Look... I have money.

1269
01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:52.243
I've heard that one before.

1270
01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:57.373
This is what you
want, right? Right?

1271
01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:00.460
Take it.

1272
01:29:03.921 --> 01:29:05.256
[gun rattles]

1273
01:29:07.216 --> 01:29:08.426
What I want...

1274
01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:12.930
What I want

1275
01:29:13.806 --> 01:29:15.433
is what you took from me.

1276
01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:19.371
I want my life back.

1277
01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:20.980
My husband.

1278
01:29:21.814 --> 01:29:22.814
My Bill!

1279
01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.108
[Mason] Jane.

1280
01:29:28.821 --> 01:29:29.947
Don't.

1281
01:29:31.991 --> 01:29:33.284
He's gonna hang.

1282
01:29:34.118 --> 01:29:35.328
I'll make certain.

1283
01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:37.789
What difference does it make?

1284
01:29:38.414 --> 01:29:41.334
It matters to me.
You're better than him.

1285
01:29:50.009 --> 01:29:51.177
[gun clicks]

1286
01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.848
[gun clacks]

1287
01:29:55.973 --> 01:29:57.975
- [Jane shouts]
- [Jack thuds]

1288
01:30:05.024 --> 01:30:08.194
[melancholic music playing]

1289
01:30:09.987 --> 01:30:11.489
Did you know it was empty?

1290
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:28.381
[chains rattling]

1291
01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:30.550
[Jane] You make certain
he pays for Bill.

1292
01:30:30.675 --> 01:30:33.386
'Cause if you don't,
I'll be coming back.

1293
01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:42.228
There's room for one more.

1294
01:30:42.895 --> 01:30:44.981
Bet we could use
somebody with grit.

1295
01:30:45.731 --> 01:30:46.732
No thanks.

1296
01:30:51.028 --> 01:30:52.572
So what you gonna do now,

1297
01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:54.699
Calamity Jane?

1298
01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:55.801
Ah, I think I'll try

1299
01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:57.702
just being Jane for a while.

1300
01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:02.874
This will make for one
hell of a story, won't it?

1301
01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:06.812
I'll be on the lookout
for that book of yours.

1302
01:31:06.836 --> 01:31:09.714
Well, I reckon it finally
has a proper hero.

1303
01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:12.175
- [gentle music continues]
- [horse snorts]

1304
01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:41.287
So you just let
her go like that?

1305
01:31:42.788 --> 01:31:44.373
That really how it happened?

1306
01:31:49.712 --> 01:31:50.712
Maybe.

1307
01:31:51.297 --> 01:31:52.465
Maybe not.

1308
01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:57.470
But it sure does make for one
hell of a story, doesn't it?

1309
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:08.439
[bluegrass music playing]

1310
01:35:19.171 --> 01:35:20.506
[music ends]
