1
00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:52.875
The holidays are
supposed to be special,

2
00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.166
because you get to spend time
with the people you love.

3
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.666
But if you ask me…

4
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.375
…my family spends too much
time together as it is.

5
00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:00.458
- Manny!
- Ooh.

6
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:01.941
If you wanna hear the truth,

7
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.583
the real meaning of the season
isn't about togetherness

8
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.791
or any of that
other corny stuff.

9
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.583
For me, Christmas is
all about the gifts.

10
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.125
And if you're a kid,

11
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:14.875
your only goal is to maximize the amount
of presents you get on the big day.

12
00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:19.125
The problem is, if you
want a lot of gifts,

13
00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:22.083
you have to be good during the
whole month leading up to Christmas.

14
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.375
And it's hard to be on your best
behavior at this time of year…

15
00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:26.458
Greg.

16
00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.101
…because there are so many ways

17
00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:30.750
a kid can mess up.

18
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:31.916
Mom!

19
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.041
I mean, like, so many.

20
00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.375
Not exactly naughty,
but definitely gross!

21
00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:40.000
Here's the thing. I'm getting
worried that my window

22
00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:43.250
for getting quality presents on
Christmas might be starting to close,

23
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.708
'cause I've noticed that the older
you get, the worse your gifts are.

24
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:47.916
Underwear?

25
00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.833
So, if this is really my last
chance to get something I want,

26
00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.833
I'm gonna make sure I'm good,
so I can go out with a bang.

27
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.166
Boom!

28
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.083
Oh.

29
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.583
Whoo! Ha! I am the
lord of lights!

30
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.208
Ooh!

31
00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:18.791
- What should we name him?
- Icy Osbourne.

32
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:20.291

a hundred years old.

Oh, Rodrick, it's all
part of the charm.

44
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.083

uh, can we talk about this
video game system now?

50
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.208
- It's got the platinum omega chip...
- Oh!

51
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:18.791
And the graphics are, like,
realer than real life.

52
00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.375
Yes, Greg, I believe
you've mentioned that.

53
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.083
What are the chances of
me getting it? Like, 80%?

54
00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:27.916
Sixty-five?

55
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.916
Mmm, well, have you been
good during the last year?

56
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.750
The last year?

57
00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:36.916
I mean, I thought it was, like, more of a
Thanksgiving to Christmas kind of thing.

58
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.041
Santa doesn't take
vacations, Greg.

59
00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.875
So, you should always be
on your best behavior.

60
00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.208
Yeah, well, the thing about coal
in your stocking is just a myth.

61
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:47.708
Trust me. I'd know.

62
00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:49.500
Thank you, Rodrick. Hello.

63
00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:51.166
Can we please stay focused?

64
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:54.333
I don't know, Greg. Don't you
already have a gaming system?

65
00:03:54.416 --> 00:03:56.250
The one I have is
totally outdated.

66
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.166
And if I don't get this new one,

67
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.333
I won't be able to play
games with my friends.

68
00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:04.000
You do want me to have
friends, right, Mom?

69
00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:07.333
Oh, Greg. Can we just pause
this conversation for tonight

70
00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:09.708
and enjoy this holiday moment?

71
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.750
- Bye-bye, breakfast.
- Ah. That's the spot.

72
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.666
- Ow! Hey, hey!
- Oh.

73
00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:22.708
Okay, I got three
different kinds of tinsel.

74
00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:24.708
I grabbed everything
that was on the shelf.

75
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.666
Frank, where did
you find this box?

76
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.833
Oh, it was, uh, in the back, under
the trash bags with the wreaths in it.

77
00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:32.916
Did I do good?

78
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.250
I haven't seen this in years.

79
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:37.958
I thought it was lost.

80
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.250
Aw.

81
00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:43.500
Ooh!

82
00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:46.000
What is that thing?

83
00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:50.541
This thing was a very important part
of my family's holiday tradition.

84
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:57.708
My grandmother knitted Elfrendo herself,
using a pinch of Christmas magic.

85
00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:01.666
Elfrendo?

86
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.416
That's right. He's one of
Santa's most important scouts.

87
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.083
He reports directly to
the big man himself.

88
00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:11.458
So if you were to be getting
that gift that you want so badly,

89
00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:14.541
then you might wanna make sure
you don't step out of line,

90
00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.375
because Santa will
hear about it!

91
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:20.708
Now, where's a good perch
for our little friend?

92
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:23.375
Oh, this should do it.

93
00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:26.583
Wait. We're... We're
keeping that thing in here?

94
00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:28.083
Of course we are, Greg.

95
00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:31.750
Elfrendo is gonna make sure
everyone's on their best behavior

96
00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:34.500
for the next two weeks.

97
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.541
Can we go back inside now?

98
00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:52.625
'Cause it's cold out here.

99
00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:55.583
Maybe we can ask your mom
to make us hot chocolate,

100
00:05:55.666 --> 00:05:58.000
the kind with the
miniature marshmallows!

101
00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:00.708
No, no, no. We're much
better off outside.

102
00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:02.416
Trust me on that.

103
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.833
But I don't even get what
we're doing out here.

104
00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:09.750
We're building a snowman, Rowley,
and trying to stay out of trouble.

105
00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:13.833
But, Greg, this doesn't
even look like a snowman.

106
00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:15.333
Well, this is just a base.

107
00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:19.000
Once we get this thing, like, ten
feet tall, we'll add the next level.

108
00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:23.916
But how are we gonna get a
snowball on top of this one?

109
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I don't know. Maybe
we can rent a crane.

110
00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:28.875
We'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

111
00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:29.958
Come on, now.

112
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:32.041
Stop standing around
and help me out here.

113
00:06:33.916 --> 00:06:37.083
So, are you gonna get that
video game system you want?

114
00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:38.226
I don't know.

115
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.958
My mom's not giving anything
away, and I've looked everywhere.

116
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:45.166
You look for gifts?

117
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.666
But isn't that naughty?

118
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.083
Hey, if they're gonna leave my
presents out where I can find them,

119
00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:52.166
then it's fair game.

120
00:06:53.458 --> 00:06:55.041
You don't look for your gifts?

121
00:06:55.125 --> 00:06:57.500
All my presents come from Santa,

122
00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:00.833
and he doesn't bring them till
I'm asleep on Christmas Eve.

123
00:07:00.916 --> 00:07:02.750
Yeah.

124
00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:05.708
So, what do you think about this
Santa Claus character anyway?

125
00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.000
What do you mean?

126
00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:08.142
Supposedly,

127
00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:09.526
he watches you
when you're asleep.

128
00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:11.666
- I mean, it's a little creepy.
- Hmm?

129
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.000
Isn't a person entitled
to a little privacy?

130
00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:17.250
Greg, he can hear you.

131
00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.226
And what about the bathroom?

132
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.500
I mean, shouldn't that
be a protected zone?

133
00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:23.500
What are the rules here?

134
00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:25.583
He doesn't know what
he's saying, Santa.

135
00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:26.666
I...

136
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.416
I just don't like having to be
good to get something I want.

137
00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:31.666
It's a lot of work.

138
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.250
But you're supposed to
be good just to be good.

139
00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:39.750
Yeah, that never really
made sense to me.

140
00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:43.541
Hey, what did I say
about standing around?

141
00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.041
Come on. Help me out here.

142
00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:53.375

Hey, Tyler, sweetie.
What do you need?

146
00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:05.309
- Come on. Let's go!
- Faster.

147
00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:07.573
Leftover chicken is in
the fridge, middle shelf.

148
00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:09.458
'Kay, honeybunches.

149
00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:13.041
Mom's gotta finish up just
one last street. Bye-bye now.

150
00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:21.666
What the heck?

151
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.583
Uh, hey, kid, why don't
you, uh, get a move on?

152
00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:32.000
Oh, boy.

153
00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:34.916
Yep, always one of
these kids every year.

154
00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.125
I think it's stuck
on something, Greg.

155
00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:42.541
You're just not
trying hard enough.

156
00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.208
Here, move out of the way.

157
00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:46.958
You gotta do it like this.

158
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.750
See? That got it moving.

159
00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.208
Uh, Greg?

160
00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:59.750
Oh, no. Oh, man.

161
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:01.125
We ruined the lawn.

162
00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.958
What are we gonna do, Greg?

163
00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:08.041
Here, here. Help me cover
it up before someone sees.

164
00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.708
- Um, okay.
- Hurry, hurry!

165
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:15.125
Okay, look, if you don't move,

166
00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:19.625
I won't be able to clear the streets
so you kids can go to school tomorrow.

167
00:09:21.708 --> 00:09:24.208
Hello? Yoo-hoo.

168
00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:28.083
Oh, that can't be good.

169
00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:30.000
Oh, yeah!

170
00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:31.833
It's an ambush!

171
00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:35.208
Get her!

172
00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:40.875
Okay, there. Good as new.

173
00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.166
You know, I think we got a pretty
good start on this snowman.

174
00:09:47.666 --> 00:09:49.208
We're never going to school!

175
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:50.541
Stop, stop, stop it!

176
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:54.041
Hey, what do you say we go to your
place? We can get some hot chocolate.

177
00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:54.958
Yes.

178
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:58.416
It's this kind of teamwork that's gonna
score some major points with Santa.

179
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.500
Rowley! Uh, do something?

180
00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:05.583
I got this!

181
00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:08.625
Greg!

182
00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:09.875
Rowley!

183
00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:14.708
Oh, no.

184
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.833
Uh-oh.

185
00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:19.708
Ho ho...

186
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.541
Okay, listen!

187
00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.500
One more snowball and
I'm calling the cops!

188
00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.083
- Wha...
- Huh?

189
00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:30.000
What is that?

190
00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:31.750
- Whoa!
- Uh-oh.

191
00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:36.875
Ho ho ho.

192
00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:43.250
No! No, no. No,
no, no, no, no, no!

193
00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:48.375
Ho ho... Ho-Ho-Ho... Ho.

194
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.875
Ho-Ho-Ho. Ho.

195
00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:51.958
Oh, no.

196
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.833
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

197
00:10:56.916 --> 00:10:59.666
Of course this happens to me.

198
00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:07.500
Come on.

199
00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.500
Come on, baby.

200
00:11:13.666 --> 00:11:16.333
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

201
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.333
Hey, you! You! Yeah, I see
you, mister red hat, red scarf!

202
00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:26.041
Stay right where you are!

203
00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:28.291
Come on, Rowley. We
need to get out of here.

204
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:37.500
Hey, Greg! I think we lost her.

205
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.458
Oh, you little twerps
think you can outrun me?

206
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.041
Rowley. Come on.

207
00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:51.750
We are still running.

208
00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:53.833
Hey, hey! You two,
stop right there!

209
00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:02.041
Hey!

210
00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:05.875
Whoa... Whoa!

211
00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.333
Left, left! No, go right!

212
00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:28.583
What the…

213
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:36.791
Gotcha.

214
00:13:01.791 --> 00:13:04.291
I see you two!

215
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:06.125
You're in big trouble!

216
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.375
We gotta get out of here.

217
00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:18.416
I think we should go
back. It's getting dark.

218
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.041
I'm scared, Greg.

219
00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:22.041
Are you crazy? We can't go back.

220
00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:24.541
That snowplow lady is
probably waiting for us.

221
00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:28.041
Maybe we should go back, so we
can tell her it was an accident.

222
00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.958
Don't you get it, Rowley? We
damaged government property.

223
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:34.625
We could go to jail for that.

224
00:13:34.708 --> 00:13:36.791
We shouldn't even go
back on our street.

225
00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:38.541
I can't go to jail!

226
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.333
My parents would be…

227
00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:42.458
disappointed in me!

228
00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:43.958
Well, I can't go to jail either.

229
00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:47.541
I heard they have metal toilets,
and they're right out in the open.

230
00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.625
I need my privacy when
I go to the bathroom.

231
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.333
I can't believe this.

232
00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:54.666
I was trying so hard to be good.

233
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.750
Do you think you'll still
get that video game system?

234
00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:59.083
I don't know, Rowley!

235
00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:01.166
We have other things
to deal with right now.

236
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:02.958
Uh…

237
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:08.125
So I'm pretty sure the snowplow
lady didn't get a good look at us,

238
00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:10.416
but she definitely saw
what we were wearing.

239
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.416
So we're gonna have to
ditch this winter gear

240
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.250
so no one can identify us.

241
00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:17.833
I got these earmuffs for getting
a B+ in handwriting this quarter.

242
00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:19.750
Sorry, Rowley, but
this stuff's gotta go.

243
00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:22.791
Now we just need a
place to ditch it.

244
00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:24.500
Where are we gonna do that?

245
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.750
There.

246
00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:31.583
The dumpster?

247
00:14:37.458 --> 00:14:40.208
Are you sure we have to do this?

248
00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:43.541
These earmuffs are
so warm and comfy.

249
00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:47.458
What is it gonna be? Cold
ears? Or life behind bars?

250
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.666
Oh, Greg! There you are.

251
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.875
I was starting to get
worried about you.

252
00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.333
Um…

253
00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:29.958
Me and Rowley were just out
enjoying the first big snow day.

254
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.416
I guess we lost track of time.

255
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.791
Oh, well, that's great.

256
00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:35.125
Where are your hat and scarf?

257
00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:36.708
Uh, I don't know.

258
00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:40.791
I guess I must've
dropped them in the snow.

259
00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:43.833
Oh, Greg, your Aunt
Lydia made those for you.

260
00:15:43.916 --> 00:15:46.583
Well, it would break her heart
if she found out you lost them.

261
00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:50.166
I'm sure they'll turn up when
the snow melts in the spring.

262
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.666
Oh, someone will probably
find them before then.

263
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.291
And luckily for you, Aunt Lydia stitched
your name on the inside of your hat.

264
00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:58.541
Wait. My-My name's in there?

265
00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.875
First and last.

266
00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:04.333
So don't worry, whoever finds your things
won't have any trouble tracking you down.

267
00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:05.458
Greg?

268
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:06.625
- Uh…
- Are you okay?

269
00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:09.833
Yeah. I think I just need to
get warmed up by the fire.

270
00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:12.083
Oh, there'll be plenty of
time for that later on.

271
00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:16.000
Right now, we're going on
a holiday family outing.

272
00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:19.500
But... Mom, I can't
go back out there.

273
00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:22.083
You can borrow your
father's old hat and scarf.

274
00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:23.916
I don't want you
catching a cold.

275
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.500
Guys, let's go!
Holiday lights time!

276
00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:30.500
- I'll be up in a sec!
- Do I have to go?

277
00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:40.583
After that I get
to have the elf.

278
00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.500
♪ You know Dasher and
Dancer Prancer and Vixen ♪

279
00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:46.416

284
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.916
Guys.

285
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.666
Am I the only one with any
Christmas spirit in this family?

286
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.250
I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood
for Christmas carols right now.

287
00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:03.934
Can we go back home now? I...

288
00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.083
We're not cutting this
drive short, Greg.

289
00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:08.250
It is our family tradition.

290
00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.041
Whoo-hoo.

291
00:17:10.125 --> 00:17:11.541
Oh, Rodrick.

292
00:17:13.125 --> 00:17:15.017
Starting late Thursday night,

293
00:17:15.041 --> 00:17:17.291
we're expecting a total
winter whiteout of mass...

294
00:17:17.375 --> 00:17:18.708
Come on, Frank.

295
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:20.916
Could you please stop
obsessing over the weather?

296
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.666
They're saying this could
be the storm of the century.

297
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.166
I just wanna be prepared.

298
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.958
Those weather people are
always hyping storms.

299
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:29.875
It's what keeps
them in business.

300
00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:32.250
Oh, honey.

301
00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:35.208
We gotta remember to donate a few
things for the toy drive this year.

302
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.916
- The toy drive?
- Yes, Greg.

303
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.958
That drop box is where everyone leaves
their spare toys for needy kids.

304
00:17:41.041 --> 00:17:43.666
The toys get picked
up on Christmas Eve.

305
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.166
Drop box?

306
00:17:46.583 --> 00:17:47.791
What is it gonna be?

307
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:54.583
Cold ears? Or
life behind bars?

308
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.333
Mm-hmm.

309
00:18:01.166 --> 00:18:02.875
- Attention, all units.
- Uh…

310
00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.892
Possible suspects sighted
westbound on Surrey Street.

311
00:18:04.916 --> 00:18:06.041
Seven Adam 15.

312
00:18:06.125 --> 00:18:07.642
Vehicle has been
dispatched to the scene.

313
00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:10.458
Suspect is wanted in connection
with an incident of vandalism.

314
00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:19.208
Is that supposed to be us?

315
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:22.291
Rowley, we gotta get rid of these
things before someone sees them.

316
00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:31.333
Greg.

317
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.833
There's so many of them. What
if we don't get them all?

318
00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:38.708
We cannot afford to let
that happen, Rowley.

319
00:18:41.458 --> 00:18:43.138
What if someone in the
neighborhood saw us?

320
00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:46.625
Well, hello, Greg Heffley.

321
00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:49.916
Wanna finish building me?

322
00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:53.125
No, thanks, Fregley.

323
00:18:53.208 --> 00:18:55.125
I've been out here
since yesterday.

324
00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:58.458
I can't feel any
of my extremities.

325
00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:01.541
How'd he get in there?

326
00:19:01.625 --> 00:19:03.166
Keep walking.

327
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.208
Do not make eye contact.

328
00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:09.208
I think my freckles
might have frostbite.

329
00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:12.375
I don't feel good about
being so close to my house.

330
00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:15.666
Hey, maybe I can crash at
your place for a few days

331
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.166
and wait for this whole
thing to blow over.

332
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.125
But you're banned from
sleeping over at my house.

333
00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:23.166
Remember the thing with
the chocolate pudding?

334
00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:27.666
What? Come on, Rowley.

335
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.375
Your dad's probably forgotten
all about that by now.

336
00:19:30.458 --> 00:19:32.625
No.

337
00:19:32.708 --> 00:19:36.375
Look, Rowley, you do not know
what it's like at my house.

338
00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:39.458
I've got, like, five pairs of
eyes watching my every move.

339
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:40.541
Five?

340
00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:44.125
But there's only four other
people in your family.

341
00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:47.375
Well, at least that's
what it feels like.

342
00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:49.125
But you said we
don't need to worry,

343
00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:51.708
'cause we got rid of our
clothes in that dumpster, right?

344
00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:55.208
- Oh. Yeah, about that.
- What?

345
00:19:55.875 --> 00:20:00.208
Yeah, it turns out the dumpster
is actually a toy donation bin.

346
00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:02.208
It's what?

347
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:04.791
That means someone's
gonna find our clothes.

348
00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:06.791
This is bad. This is ba...

349
00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:08.500
Calm down.

350
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:12.166
I mean, it's not like our names
are written inside of them, right?

351
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.458
But what if they find hair in
our hats and test it for DNA?

352
00:20:16.541 --> 00:20:18.125
Wow. Wow, Rowley.

353
00:20:18.208 --> 00:20:20.208
You watch way too
much television.

354
00:20:20.291 --> 00:20:22.666
Look, we'll get our clothes
back just to be safe.

355
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.916
- Okay?
- Maybe we should just turn ourselves in.

356
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.333
I can't live like this.

357
00:20:26.416 --> 00:20:28.375
Breathe, Rowley.

358
00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:31.250
I got everything under
control. Here's the plan.

359
00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:35.208
We'll set our alarms, so we wake
up first thing in the morning.

360
00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:38.583
Then we'll head downtown and
grab our stuff out of that bin.

361
00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:42.291
And we get rid of it
for real this time.

362
00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:44.791
When that's done,
we are home free.

363
00:20:45.708 --> 00:20:47.916
Why don't we just do it now?

364
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.250
My mom's making us build a
gingerbread house tonight,

365
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.875
and I can't get out of it.

366
00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:56.666
I don't know. This plan
seems kind of risky.

367
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.916
Look, you gotta
trust me, Rowley.

368
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.083
Have I ever steered you wrong?

369
00:21:02.458 --> 00:21:03.541
A bunch of times.

370
00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:07.791
You gotta believe, Rowley.

371
00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:10.125
Come on. It's Christmastime.

372
00:21:11.708 --> 00:21:12.708
Uh…

373
00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:28.166
…between ten below zero

374
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.083
and 24 below zero.

375
00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:33.833
A snow emergency is in effect, with
levels reaching well above five feet.

376
00:21:33.916 --> 00:21:37.083
- Frank, can you please...
- Can't talk! Concentrating.

377
00:21:37.166 --> 00:21:38.666
Come on. Why won't this thing...

378
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.083
Would you please stop
obsessing about this storm?

379
00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:45.583
You're missing out on an authentic
holiday moment with your family.

380
00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:46.791
Manny.

381
00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:50.708
Mom, how come I have to be
here, but Rodrick doesn't?

382
00:21:50.791 --> 00:21:54.208
Well, I'd love for him to be here,
but I have no idea where he is.

383
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.750
It's like herding cats to get

384
00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:59.083
everyone in this
family in one place.

385
00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:01.500
Hey, look what I just found.

386
00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:05.375
Oh, I heard about that.

387
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.708
Can you believe that that snowplow
assault happened on our street?

388
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:11.333
You know, I'll bet
the guys behind it

389
00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:13.458
were a couple of those
rotten Whirley Street kids.

390
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:16.375
They're always coming into our
neighborhood and stirring up trouble.

391
00:22:16.458 --> 00:22:18.767
Yeah, but the Whirley Street kids
wouldn't do something so bold

392
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:20.458
in broad daylight.

393
00:22:20.541 --> 00:22:24.750
No, no. These two look
like hardened criminals.

394
00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:26.833
I could take 'em.

395
00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:29.041
Ooh, it looks like
they're offering a reward

396
00:22:29.125 --> 00:22:31.083
for more information that
leads to their capture.

397
00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:33.750
Yep. And I'm gonna claim it.

398
00:22:33.833 --> 00:22:36.083
It's how I'm paying for
your Christmas gifts.

399
00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:39.333
Mom? Mom? Can I
please be excused?

400
00:22:39.416 --> 00:22:40.833
Absolutely not, Greg.

401
00:22:40.916 --> 00:22:45.166
We are going to finish this
gingerbread house together as a family.

402
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.750
Huh?

403
00:22:50.666 --> 00:22:52.500
- Bubby!
- Ugh!

404
00:22:52.583 --> 00:22:55.000
Okay… …let's pivot.

405
00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:58.250
Frank, uh, you go get those
toys that we're gonna donate.

406
00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:01.291
And, Greg... Ooh, run upstairs
and get the wrapping paper

407
00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:02.958
from the linen closet.

408
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:06.166
This one here looks
kind of familiar.

409
00:23:07.166 --> 00:23:08.500
Hmm.

410
00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:09.750
Uh…

411
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.708
Hmm.

412
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.666
Mom, which one's the
linen closet again?

413
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.583
The one where we
keep the towels.

414
00:23:21.375 --> 00:23:22.375
Got it.

415
00:23:29.583 --> 00:23:30.875
What?

416
00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:38.958
No way.

417
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:41.541
I couldn't believe my eyes.

418
00:23:41.625 --> 00:23:46.458
The one thing I wanted was right
there in one glorious, beautiful...

419
00:23:46.541 --> 00:23:49.708
Oh, Greg, and grab the tape
while you're up there too.

420
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:51.625
Of course, Mother. I'm coming.

421
00:23:59.041 --> 00:24:00.416
Yes!

422
00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:09.583
Okay. I got three varieties
of paper and clear tape.

423
00:24:10.291 --> 00:24:11.833
You need anything else?

424
00:24:11.916 --> 00:24:15.166
Oh, well, aren't
you being helpful?

425
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.333
I guess I got the
Christmas spirit.

426
00:24:17.416 --> 00:24:21.458
Well, if you keep this up, I bet Santa
will have something extra special for you

427
00:24:21.541 --> 00:24:22.791
on Christmas morning.

428
00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:25.375
You know, I don't
really care what I get.

429
00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:27.916
I'm just trying to be the
best Greg Heffley I could be.

430
00:24:28.541 --> 00:24:30.791
Oh, aren't you a doll?

431
00:24:32.208 --> 00:24:34.708
Why don't you help me
wrap these used toys?

432
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.041
Sure thing, Mom.

433
00:24:37.333 --> 00:24:39.291
After the thing that
happened with the snowplow,

434
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:41.125
I figured my holidays were sunk,

435
00:24:41.208 --> 00:24:44.750
but everything changed for me
tonight when I found that gift.

436
00:24:44.833 --> 00:24:48.250
It just proves that sometimes,
good things happen to good people.

437
00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:51.625
Now, all I need to do is grab that
stuff out of the bin tomorrow,

438
00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:54.291
and it'll be smooth
sailing to Christmas.

439
00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:56.375
You know that poem about
children going to bed

440
00:24:56.458 --> 00:24:58.875
with visions of sugarplums
dancing in their heads?

441
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:03.791
Well, tonight I'll be dreaming of
something way better than candy.

442
00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:26.083
What the heck?

443
00:25:26.833 --> 00:25:27.916
What the heck?

444
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.101
The governor has declared
a weather emergency…

445
00:25:30.125 --> 00:25:32.791
- What the heck?
- Well, look who came to join us.

446
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:34.083
It's snowing!

447
00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.351
I guess the weather people are
right every once in a while.

448
00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:37.916
My alarm didn't go off.

449
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.083
I set it for later,
so you could sleep in.

450
00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:42.083
That's the best thing
about a snow day.

451
00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.333
More like a snow week.

452
00:25:44.416 --> 00:25:47.250
This storm's supposed to keep
going strong through Christmas Eve.

453
00:25:47.333 --> 00:25:49.083
A whole week?

454
00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:51.750
Uh, uh, I can't be
stuck inside right now.

455
00:25:51.833 --> 00:25:53.583
I've got... I've got
things I gotta do.

456
00:25:53.666 --> 00:25:55.333
Greg, where on
Earth are you going?

457
00:25:55.416 --> 00:25:57.500
I'm going to hang
out at Rowley's.

458
00:25:57.583 --> 00:25:59.166
In your pajamas?

459
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.791
Honey, it's not safe to
be outside right now.

460
00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:03.958
Mom, it's just a dusting.

461
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:06.625
I'll be back in a few...

462
00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:10.500
Greg.

463
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:11.833
Bubby frozen.

464
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.250
It took me a few hours to get my
body temperature back to normal,

465
00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:19.333
but as soon as I could
feel my fingers again,

466
00:26:19.416 --> 00:26:22.666
I grabbed the phone and called Rowley
to fill him in on the new plan.

467
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:29.833
♪ Silent night, holy night ♪

468
00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:36.583
♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪

469
00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:39.500
Oh, I'll get it.

470
00:26:39.583 --> 00:26:40.583
Don't be long, Son.

471
00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:42.500
We'll pick up at the
start of the third verse.

472
00:26:42.583 --> 00:26:44.059
Yes, Father.

473
00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:46.708
Jefferson residence.
Rowley speaking.

474
00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:48.791
Rowley, I know you know it's me.

475
00:26:48.875 --> 00:26:51.833
I'm sorry. My mom and dad like
me to use good phone manners.

476
00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:53.750
Can you believe this snow?

477
00:26:53.833 --> 00:26:56.583
- I mean, how are you guys holding up?
- We're doing great.

478
00:26:56.666 --> 00:27:00.083
We made gingerbread cookies, and
now we're singing Christmas carols.

479
00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:03.750
Oh, want me to put you on
speakerphone so you can join us?

480
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:04.875
No!

481
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:06.500
I mean, no, thanks.

482
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:09.166
Listen, Rowley, we need to make
sure we're on the same page

483
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.375
about the you-know-what.

484
00:27:11.458 --> 00:27:12.791
You mean…

485
00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:14.000
Voldemort?

486
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.791
What? That's
you-know-who, Rowley.

487
00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.958
I'm talking about the snowplow.

488
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:22.208
Oh, yeah, that.

489
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:26.375
Look, we won't be able to get our stuff
from that bin until it stops snowing.

490
00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:28.625
We're gonna have to lay low
and keep our mouths shut.

491
00:27:28.708 --> 00:27:30.083
Got it?

492
00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:32.708
- What do you mean?
- If someone beats us to that bin,

493
00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:34.434
we're gonna have to
get our story straight.

494
00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:37.708
So, if anyone comes by your house
and starts asking questions,

495
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:40.416
you don't know how our
stuff got in there, okay?

496
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.000
But why would someone
come to my house?

497
00:27:43.083 --> 00:27:45.166
There's something I
didn't tell you before.

498
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.250
It turns out my name is
stitched inside of my hat.

499
00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:51.416
Your name? That's bad.

500
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.875
Listen, everything's gonna be
okay as long as you play dumb.

501
00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:57.166
You don't know anything
about anything.

502
00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.625
But lying would be naughty,

503
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:01.083
and I'm nice!

504
00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:02.666
Rowley, I'm not
asking you to lie.

505
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.583
Santa sent the
storm to punish us.

506
00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:07.333
- He knows. He knows!
- Rowley?

507
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:09.841
Can you please calm down?

508
00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:11.500
Just focus on the
sound of my voice.

509
00:28:11.583 --> 00:28:14.083
Maybe I'll just confess. What's
the number for the police?

510
00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:16.583
911, 911, 911.

511
00:28:16.666 --> 00:28:17.976
- Rowley! Rowley!
- 911, 911, 911.

512
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.880
- Rowley, do not hang up this phone!
- 911, 911!

513
00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:21.000
- Stay on the line!
- 911!

514
00:28:27.041 --> 00:28:28.458
Rowley?

515
00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:37.166
Well, with the power out,
Rowley can't call the cops

516
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.583
and spill his guts out
about the snowplow.

517
00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:43.083
And with the whole town snowed
under, nobody's getting to that bin.

518
00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:44.875
So, my secret's safe.

519
00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:45.958
At least for now.

520
00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:48.017
All I need to do is to make
it to Christmas morning

521
00:28:48.041 --> 00:28:50.041
without anyone in my
family catching on.

522
00:28:50.125 --> 00:28:52.916
Because in one week, I can call
that video game system mine.

523
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.333
Okay.

524
00:28:54.416 --> 00:28:56.708
Three cases of water, 120
rolls of toilet paper,

525
00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:59.375
flashlights with fresh batteries
and plenty of canned goods.

526
00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:01.333
- Ooh.
- Check!

527
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:06.208
Greg, you're already shivering? The
power's only been out for a half hour.

528
00:29:06.291 --> 00:29:08.125
Yeah, we're already
starting to lose heat.

529
00:29:08.208 --> 00:29:10.916
And if it gets cold enough in
here, the pipes could burst.

530
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.125
So, nobody touch the
bottled water. Just in case.

531
00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:15.726
We might need to use it
to flush the toilets.

532
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.791
Eh, I never really flush anyway.

533
00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:19.375
Yes, Rodrick, we've noticed.

534
00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:21.166
Do we really have enough food?

535
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.333
What if we run out?

536
00:29:22.416 --> 00:29:24.208
Well, I just went
grocery shopping.

537
00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:27.041
We'll be fine for
two weeks at least.

538
00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:30.375
I read about this family that
got snowed into their cabin,

539
00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:31.541
and to survive,

540
00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:34.083
- they had to eat each other.
- Gross!

541
00:29:34.166 --> 00:29:35.541
Yummy.

542
00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:37.416
Rodrick! You're scaring Manny.

543
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.000
The last guy felt
kinda bad though.

544
00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:43.541
Well, I think everything's
gonna be just fine.

545
00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:46.291
And the next few days
are going to be fun.

546
00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:50.541
What could be better than being snowed
in with your family for the holidays?

547
00:29:50.625 --> 00:29:52.416
Literally anything.

548
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.333
No phones, no television,
no distractions.

549
00:29:56.416 --> 00:30:01.000
Just the five of us sharing in
the joy of each other's company.

550
00:30:01.083 --> 00:30:04.166
It's a Christmas miracle.

551
00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:07.166
So cold.

552
00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:15.458
Okay, guys. Who's up for
another round of charades?

553
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:23.250
- Uh…
- Um…

554
00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:24.500
Back to the Future?

555
00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:33.833
- A llama?
- She did a llama yesterday, I think.

556
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.625
Or maybe that was the day
before? I... It's getting fuzzy.

557
00:30:37.708 --> 00:30:40.208
It's an alpaca, guys. Come on.

558
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:42.625
Same thing.

559
00:30:43.291 --> 00:30:45.291
Frank, we are
playing a game here.

560
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:47.541
- Would you please sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

561
00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:50.208
I-I just gotta make sure we've
got our inventory cataloged.

562
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:51.333
All right, let's see here.

563
00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:54.875
120 toilet paper rolls, three
cases of water... Wait a minute.

564
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:58.625
There's a case missing. And
where are the cans of yams?

565
00:30:59.541 --> 00:31:00.583
Huh?

566
00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:03.458
I think one of you boys
is hoarding supplies.

567
00:31:03.541 --> 00:31:05.875
I've got a nose for yams.

568
00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:07.708
Breathe in my face.

569
00:31:07.791 --> 00:31:09.083
Whoa, whoa.

570
00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:10.791
Uh, um, Mom.

571
00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:12.517
Oh, it's okay, Rodrick.

572
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:16.291
I think your father may be suffering
from a case of cabin fever.

573
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:18.041
N-Not so fast.

574
00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:20.041
You're not off the
hook yourself, Susan.

575
00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:24.500
- Come on. Let's have it. Breathe.
- Okay.

576
00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:27.708
- That's enough, Frank.
- That-That's broccoli, isn't it?

577
00:31:28.833 --> 00:31:29.958
Greg, what's wrong?

578
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:31.500
The elf thing moved.

579
00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:34.958
It was there a minute
ago, and now it's there.

580
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:39.125
Oh, I'm sure your mind is just
playing tricks on you, honey.

581
00:31:39.208 --> 00:31:41.500
Uh, maybe you're going
a little stir-crazy too.

582
00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:42.916
I am not going crazy.

583
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.916
That thing actually moved.

584
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.833
Hmm.

585
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:50.166
Well, maybe he had an important
message to deliver to the North Pole.

586
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.666
But now he's back.

587
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.750
I wonder what he
had to tell Santa.

588
00:31:57.291 --> 00:32:00.000
Look, maybe another round of
charades will crank up the fun.

589
00:32:00.083 --> 00:32:01.541
Next category.

590
00:32:01.625 --> 00:32:04.375
Book titles of the
Edwardian period. Ooh!

591
00:32:04.458 --> 00:32:06.291
- No.
- Really?

592
00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:19.375
- The pipes burst!
- Oh, no, no, no! The basement!

593
00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:21.291
The basement? My room!

594
00:32:24.416 --> 00:32:25.583
Come on, work.

595
00:32:26.708 --> 00:32:28.083
Whoa!

596
00:32:28.166 --> 00:32:30.750
Oh, no, no, no! My
Revolutionary War diorama!

597
00:32:30.833 --> 00:32:32.250
- My drums!
- Oh, gosh.

598
00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:33.583
Be careful, Rodrick!

599
00:32:33.666 --> 00:32:35.601
- Please! No!
- No, Cornwallis!

600
00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:37.416
Not you, Cornwallis!

601
00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:43.416
I was actually kinda glad that my
family was distracted with other stuff,

602
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.500
because that gave me the chance to
stay out of sight and out of mind.

603
00:32:47.583 --> 00:32:51.250
So, my plan was to shut myself in
my room and lay low until Christmas.

604
00:32:51.333 --> 00:32:53.833
- Whoa!
- What's up, roomie?

605
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.500
Rodrick? What are
you doing here?

606
00:32:56.583 --> 00:33:00.416
Well, since my room's flooded,
I'll be crashing here for a while.

607
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.916
What? You can't stay in
here. This is my room.

608
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.208
Well, I'm not sleeping
in Manny's room.

609
00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:07.291
Something's not
right with that kid.

610
00:33:07.375 --> 00:33:10.375
And besides, I need
to keep an eye on you.

611
00:33:10.958 --> 00:33:13.833
Keep a... Keep an
eye on me? For what?

612
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.833
I've noticed you've been acting
a little suspicious lately.

613
00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:22.083
What? Now you think
I took the yams?

614
00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:26.666
Ha! This isn't
about yams, Gregory.

615
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.125
- Uh…
- Time to come clean.

616
00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:31.458
I don't know what
you're talking about.

617
00:33:31.541 --> 00:33:34.083
Red hat, red scarf.

618
00:33:34.166 --> 00:33:36.166
Just like the ones
you lost, huh?

619
00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:39.750
Fine. What do you know?

620
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:42.833
All right, here's how I
think it all went down.

621
00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:46.416
You and your little buddy were
in the front yard last week,

622
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.833
frolicking in the snow.

623
00:33:49.666 --> 00:33:54.666
Then, along came some high schoolers who
saw you two weaklings as easy targets.

624
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.541
Nice winter gear, dum-dums.

625
00:33:56.625 --> 00:33:58.500
Now, it's ours.

626
00:33:58.583 --> 00:34:01.383
So, they stole your winter gear,
rolled you up in a snowball,

627
00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:02.708
and pushed you down the hill.

628
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:05.041
So long, twerps!

629
00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:07.916
And wham! You nailed
that snowplow.

630
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.916
We're so bad.

631
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.458
But now, you and your little
friend have a problem, right?

632
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:16.791
The guys who took your stuff
are on the run from the law.

633
00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:19.500
- The fuzz!
- But they know where you live.

634
00:34:19.583 --> 00:34:22.791
So if you rat them out for what
they did, you're both dead.

635
00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:26.958
Really, Rodrick? That's
what you came up with?

636
00:34:27.041 --> 00:34:30.625
Well, I, uh... I'm still
working out the details.

637
00:34:30.708 --> 00:34:34.708
But it's just a matter of time before
I find out what happened for sure.

638
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:35.791
What do you mean?

639
00:34:35.875 --> 00:34:39.458
All the evidence is
stored right here.

640
00:34:40.375 --> 00:34:41.791
On our doorbell?

641
00:34:41.875 --> 00:34:45.708
Yes, Greg, on our doorbell.
It's got a camera in it.

642
00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:48.101
And everything that happens on
the street in front of our house

643
00:34:48.125 --> 00:34:51.250
gets recorded on this
little box right here.

644
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.833
Yeah, well, good luck finding
out what's on that thing

645
00:34:56.916 --> 00:34:58.416
without any electricity.

646
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.291
I think you underestimate
me, Gregory.

647
00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:05.291
Nothing is getting in between
me and that reward money.

648
00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:07.083
And I'm calling the bed.

649
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.750
Ah!

650
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.833

more days, Greg Heffley.

00:37:09.875 --> 00:37:11.226
- Greg! Stop!
- Rodrick!

688
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.767
- No, no, no! My tree!
- Stop!

689
00:37:12.791 --> 00:37:13.958
Susan!

690
00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:17.458
Oh! Hmm.

691
00:37:21.041 --> 00:37:22.083
It's alive!

692
00:37:22.166 --> 00:37:23.750
It's alive!

693
00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:31.041
This isn't happening.

694
00:37:31.125 --> 00:37:32.125
This isn't happening!

695
00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:40.166
Yay!

696
00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:43.541
Okay. Okay.

697
00:37:43.625 --> 00:37:44.708
That ought to do it.

698
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:48.125
Everyone gets three-quarters
of a wall and five gumdrops.

699
00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:49.666
And no seconds.

700
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.791
We have to save the
roof for dinner.

701
00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:54.166
Dictator. I've had
it with you people.

702
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.750
I just don't understand
how we ran out of food.

703
00:37:56.833 --> 00:38:00.375
No food, no water, no
batteries, no toilet paper.

704
00:38:00.458 --> 00:38:02.958
How? How could we have gone
through everything so quickly?

705
00:38:03.041 --> 00:38:05.875
Guys! Check this out.

706
00:38:11.166 --> 00:38:14.166
I've built a device that
powers our doorbell camera,

707
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.500
and the video is
almost done buffering.

708
00:38:16.583 --> 00:38:18.958
I'm finally gonna figure out
who wrecked that snowplow.

709
00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:22.333
Drumroll, please.

710
00:38:26.166 --> 00:38:28.125
Behold!

711
00:38:28.208 --> 00:38:29.666
My potatoes!

712
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.000
My Christmas lights!

713
00:38:32.083 --> 00:38:33.666
Wait, wait! No, no,
no, no! Stop, stop!

714
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.166
Oh, come on.

715
00:38:40.666 --> 00:38:44.583
Rodrick, my Christmas
decorations are not toys.

716
00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:46.291
I have been looking for these.

717
00:38:46.375 --> 00:38:48.125
We need all the food we can get.

718
00:38:48.208 --> 00:38:49.625
How did we run out
of food, Frank?

719
00:38:49.708 --> 00:38:51.958
I thought we had enough
to last us two weeks.

720
00:38:52.041 --> 00:38:54.375
If everyone only took
their fair share…

721
00:38:54.458 --> 00:38:57.333
Don't tell me you're gonna
start in on those yams again.

722
00:38:57.416 --> 00:38:59.333
Rodrick's been
hoarding potatoes.

723
00:38:59.416 --> 00:39:01.500
Who knows what else
these boys are hiding?

724
00:39:01.583 --> 00:39:03.916
Now's not the time
for paranoia, Frank.

725
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.291
You're scaring Manny.

726
00:39:06.916 --> 00:39:08.916
Wait, where is Manny?

727
00:39:13.041 --> 00:39:14.041
Manny?

728
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:16.875
Manny?

729
00:39:16.958 --> 00:39:18.958
Manny! Manny!

730
00:39:19.041 --> 00:39:20.375
Manny!

731
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.458
Manny!

732
00:39:22.541 --> 00:39:24.708
Manny! Manny?

733
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:26.250
- Manny!
- Manny!

734
00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:27.875
- Manny!
- Manny!

735
00:39:27.958 --> 00:39:29.833
Oh, Manny, Manny, Manny.

736
00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:31.083
Where could you be?

737
00:39:31.166 --> 00:39:33.083
I checked in the
garage. He's not there.

738
00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:36.291
I couldn't find him in any
of his regular hiding spots.

739
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:37.916
He's not in his room.

740
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.333
He wasn't in the
bathroom either,

741
00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:43.416
but I'd suggest you all give it a good
20 minutes before you go in there.

742
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.250
You don't think he's out there?

743
00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:53.791
My precious baby, out
in the storm alone.

744
00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:57.833
- Do you guys hear…
- Music?

745
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.541
Huh?

746
00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:07.791
Manny.

747
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.500
Uh-oh.

748
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.916
So, that's where all
the supplies went.

749
00:40:14.416 --> 00:40:16.875
Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

750
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.500
Huh. Respect.

751
00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:25.875
Okay.

752
00:40:25.958 --> 00:40:27.583
And there we go.

753
00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:30.916
This little guy is
not going anywhere.

754
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.125
Well, can you blame him, Frank?

755
00:40:33.208 --> 00:40:35.041
He was just looking
out for himself.

756
00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:37.791
The whole experience has
probably scarred him.

757
00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:42.041
Seems fine to me.

758
00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:44.625
Could we please
lighten up, guys?

759
00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.791
Things could be a
whole lot worse.

760
00:40:46.875 --> 00:40:49.625
Um, how exactly?

761
00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:50.958
Well…

762
00:40:52.791 --> 00:40:54.333
There could be…

763
00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:57.083
We could…

764
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:03.916
Yeah, this really is
rock bottom, I guess.

765
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.625
I suppose, I got a
little carried away too.

766
00:41:06.708 --> 00:41:08.333
Especially with the yams.

767
00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:09.500
You can say that again.

768
00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:11.750
Breathe in my face.

769
00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:21.375
What are yams exactly, anyway?

770
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:23.541
I don't know,

771
00:41:24.416 --> 00:41:25.666
but they're delicious.

772
00:41:29.375 --> 00:41:32.458
I know this wasn't the Christmas
season we were hoping for, guys.

773
00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:34.833
But at least we'll
never forget it.

774
00:41:34.916 --> 00:41:36.250
Hope you're wrong about that.

775
00:41:36.333 --> 00:41:38.250
I'm already trying to
scrub it from my brain.

776
00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:41.333
Well, maybe there's still time
to turn things around tonight.

777
00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:44.250
What do you say we try
and have a little fun?

778
00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:47.375
Oh, please, not charades again.

779
00:41:47.458 --> 00:41:50.041
Now, I know it's not
officially Christmas yet,

780
00:41:50.125 --> 00:41:53.208
but what do you guys think about
getting a little sneak preview?

781
00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:54.958
- Yeah!
- Hey, all right!

782
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:57.916
Everyone can pick out
one gift to open tonight.

783
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.333
But choose carefully

784
00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.208
because you're gonna have to make
it last until tomorrow morning.

785
00:42:07.166 --> 00:42:10.000
Uh-uh-uh. You might wanna wait
till the electricity's back on

786
00:42:10.083 --> 00:42:11.416
to open that one, Greg.

787
00:42:12.416 --> 00:42:13.750
You're a good kid.

788
00:42:13.833 --> 00:42:15.000
You've earned it.

789
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.708
Clothes? Seriously?

790
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:31.125
Oh, Aunt Lydia made you
another hat and scarf.

791
00:42:31.208 --> 00:42:32.458
Can I pick again?

792
00:42:32.541 --> 00:42:34.958
Now you don't need someone
to find your old ones.

793
00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:37.081
Look, Greg.

794
00:42:37.125 --> 00:42:38.541
Aunt Lydia is upping her game.

795
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.041
Uh, guys? Guys?

796
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.458
Did it stop snowing?

797
00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:54.166
It's a Christmas miracle!

798
00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:55.500
All right!

799
00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:56.583
- Yes!
- Yes!

800
00:42:57.916 --> 00:42:59.750
Huh. Check it out. Cops.

801
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:00.833
What?

802
00:43:01.833 --> 00:43:03.726
They must be going to
collect those toys.

803
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.541
Frank, we never turned in our
donation for the toy drive.

804
00:43:07.625 --> 00:43:10.750
Wait, what do the police have
to do with the toy drive?

805
00:43:10.833 --> 00:43:13.833
The police are the ones who
collect the donations from the bin

806
00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:15.625
and get them to the
families in need.

807
00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:19.625
Isn't it wonderful that they sacrifice
their personal time to do that?

808
00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:26.375
Hmm. Looks like it
belongs to Greg Heffley.

809
00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:28.458
Uh, Bravo 6,

810
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:32.416
we've identified the suspect as
notorious troublemaker Gregory Heffley.

811
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.767
Copy that. Lock him up.

812
00:43:35.041 --> 00:43:39.375
I hope you're proud of
what ya did, Greg Heffley.

813
00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:41.750
Oh, and Merry Christmas!

814
00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:44.333
I hope you like your present.

815
00:43:44.958 --> 00:43:47.541
It looks like you're
gonna have to share!

816
00:44:04.416 --> 00:44:05.416
Greg, are you okay?

817
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.250
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

818
00:44:07.958 --> 00:44:09.958
I think I need to go
upstairs and lay down.

819
00:44:11.375 --> 00:44:12.875
I don't feel so good.

820
00:44:12.958 --> 00:44:14.166
Sure, honey.

821
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.250
Get some rest.

822
00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:17.625
I hope you feel better
for the big day tomorrow.

823
00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:24.666
Probably too many yams.

824
00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:31.125
I knew that if I didn't get to
that bin before the cops did,

825
00:44:31.208 --> 00:44:33.083
I was gonna spend my
Christmas in the slammer.

826
00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:38.166
So, I mustered up my courage and headed
out into the dark, cold night on my own.

827
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:41.291
It's go time.

828
00:44:44.958 --> 00:44:46.416
You gotta be kidding me.

829
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:13.333
Uh…

830
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.916
Uh, what's out there, Joshie?

831
00:45:21.208 --> 00:45:22.625
Hey! Greg?

832
00:45:23.625 --> 00:45:26.250
Sorry. I didn't know how
else to get your attention.

833
00:45:26.333 --> 00:45:28.166
It's Christmas Eve.

834
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:29.333
Shouldn't you be in bed?

835
00:45:29.416 --> 00:45:31.625
In bed? But it's only 7:30.

836
00:45:31.708 --> 00:45:34.458
I like to be asleep in
case Santa comes early.

837
00:45:34.541 --> 00:45:35.875
Well, I need your help.

838
00:45:35.958 --> 00:45:37.500
This is bigger than Santa.

839
00:45:37.583 --> 00:45:40.250
Nothing's bigger than Santa.

840
00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:43.833
The police are gonna empty
out that toy bin tonight.

841
00:45:43.916 --> 00:45:47.000
And my name is stitched
on the inside of that hat.

842
00:45:47.083 --> 00:45:49.875
But I'm already in
my footie pajamas.

843
00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:52.541
Well, enjoy your last
night of freedom.

844
00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:56.541
Because once they've got me, they're
gonna wanna know who my accomplice is.

845
00:45:58.166 --> 00:45:59.583
Rowley.

846
00:46:06.458 --> 00:46:07.583
Rowley.

847
00:46:09.791 --> 00:46:11.333
Let's do this.

848
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.708
Whoa. Are you all right, buddy?

849
00:46:16.375 --> 00:46:17.666
Yeah.

850
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.416
All right. That's my pal.

851
00:46:21.416 --> 00:46:23.392
Seven Adam 15.

852
00:46:23.416 --> 00:46:25.375
Vehicle has been
dispatched to the scene.

853
00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:28.708
No reports from downtown…

854
00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:42.708
Uh, Greg?

855
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.958
Where did the donation bin go?

856
00:46:46.208 --> 00:46:49.125
The storm's
completely buried it.

857
00:46:49.208 --> 00:46:50.625
That's why I brought these.

858
00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.541
Come on. It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

859
00:46:54.583 --> 00:46:56.833
I think it was under
this lamppost, Greg.

860
00:46:56.916 --> 00:46:58.916
No, I'm pretty sure
it was over here.

861
00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:07.000
Um, maybe over here?

862
00:47:10.375 --> 00:47:11.541
Let's try over there.

863
00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:18.375
We're never going to find it.

864
00:47:18.458 --> 00:47:20.375
We should just… …give up.

865
00:47:20.458 --> 00:47:22.208
That bin's gotta be here!

866
00:47:27.041 --> 00:47:29.125
Ha! I knew I'd find it.

867
00:47:29.208 --> 00:47:31.500
It's always in the last
place you look, right?

868
00:47:31.583 --> 00:47:32.809
- But, Greg, I...
- Come on!

869
00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:33.916
Let's dig it up.

870
00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:38.500
- Yes!
- Whoo!

871
00:47:40.333 --> 00:47:41.791
Our stuff is still here.

872
00:47:41.875 --> 00:47:43.708
Let's grab it and
get out of here.

873
00:47:43.791 --> 00:47:45.375
I'm gonna need you
to hold my legs.

874
00:47:46.125 --> 00:47:48.291
Almost there.

875
00:47:50.875 --> 00:47:53.041
Got it! Okay, pull me up.

876
00:47:55.958 --> 00:47:57.291
Greg, it's the cops!

877
00:47:58.458 --> 00:47:59.517
Rowley, I'm slipping.

878
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:02.625
Rowley!

879
00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:05.333
You got this, Greg!

880
00:48:05.416 --> 00:48:06.583
Rowley.

881
00:48:13.166 --> 00:48:15.291
Oh, man. N-No, no, no.

882
00:48:15.375 --> 00:48:17.250
Hey! What are you
doin' out here?

883
00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:19.583
Uh, I'm sorry,
officer. I... I didn't…

884
00:48:24.875 --> 00:48:28.416
Wait. Yo-You're just a kid.

885
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.500
Honey, shouldn't you be
home on Christmas Eve?

886
00:48:32.041 --> 00:48:37.708
Uh, I was just making sure the
police could get to the bin

887
00:48:37.791 --> 00:48:39.541
so they could collect the toys.

888
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.458
You know, for the kids.

889
00:48:47.083 --> 00:48:50.666
I was supposed to clear this lot
a few days ago, but I couldn't.

890
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.416
Someone broke my plow.

891
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.666
I was gonna try and
shovel it by hand.

892
00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:57.125
You saved me a lot
of time tonight, kid.

893
00:48:57.208 --> 00:48:58.333
Well…

894
00:48:58.416 --> 00:49:00.750
Uh, the spirit of
Christmas and all that.

895
00:49:00.833 --> 00:49:03.333
Well, I think you can feel
pretty good about this one.

896
00:49:03.416 --> 00:49:05.791
It'll put you on Santa's
nice list for sure.

897
00:49:05.875 --> 00:49:07.666
Yeah.

898
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:12.500
Hey, how about I give you a ride so
you can get back home to your family?

899
00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:13.583
Sure.

900
00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:24.541
So, you, um, getting anything
good for Christmas this year?

901
00:49:25.416 --> 00:49:27.666
Yeah. A new video game system.

902
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:30.291
Oh, man, you lucky dog.

903
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:31.875
Yeah, my Tyler
wanted one of those,

904
00:49:31.958 --> 00:49:35.375
but I'm gonna have to save up my pennies
before I can afford something like that.

905
00:49:35.458 --> 00:49:37.041
But next year though. Next year.

906
00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:40.583
Just gonna have to put in a few extra
hours in this old bucket of bolts.

907
00:49:42.208 --> 00:49:43.875
Where'd you say you live again?

908
00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:45.708
Uh, Surrey Street.

909
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:46.791
It's on the hill.

910
00:49:46.875 --> 00:49:48.166
You gotta be kidding me!

911
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.250
That's the street where
my plow got busted.

912
00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:54.333
And you know what? They never did
catch those hooligans that did it.

913
00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:59.250
So, is this plowing stuff,
like, your full-time job?

914
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:00.375
Oh, this? No.

915
00:50:00.458 --> 00:50:03.250
No, I just do this on
the side for extra cash.

916
00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.666
It helps this time of year.

917
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:11.291
You know, there weren't a lot
of toys in that donation bin.

918
00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:14.125
Do you think the cops will
even bother handing them out?

919
00:50:14.208 --> 00:50:16.416
Oh, yeah, no, sure, they'll
take whatever's in there,

920
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.958
and they'll get it out to the
kids that need it the most.

921
00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:22.208
Hey, lots of families depend
on those donations, you know?

922
00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:24.041
Mine included.

923
00:50:26.666 --> 00:50:28.083
Is that your son?

924
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:30.875
Yep. My Tyler.

925
00:50:30.958 --> 00:50:32.458
He's the whole world to me.

926
00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:33.791
It's just me and him.

927
00:50:33.875 --> 00:50:36.333
You're lucky there
are only two of you.

928
00:50:36.416 --> 00:50:38.208
I've got four other
people in my family,

929
00:50:38.291 --> 00:50:41.125
and they've been driving
me totally nuts lately.

930
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:46.291
Let me give you a
little advice, kid.

931
00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:49.791
My family made me crazy
when I was your age too.

932
00:50:49.875 --> 00:50:52.708
I mean, they drove me bananas.

933
00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:55.958
But boy do I miss 'em now.

934
00:50:56.041 --> 00:50:59.041
Treasure every single moment
you have with those people

935
00:50:59.791 --> 00:51:02.208
because nothing in
life is guaranteed.

936
00:51:06.333 --> 00:51:08.000
Um, this is my turn.

937
00:51:21.625 --> 00:51:22.958
What?

938
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.083
All right, kid.

939
00:51:32.166 --> 00:51:33.916
It's been nice
getting to know ya.

940
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.583
Yeah. Thanks for the ride.

941
00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:46.500
You!

942
00:51:48.916 --> 00:51:50.083
You…

943
00:51:51.458 --> 00:51:54.333
You seem like a good kid.

944
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.833
Now, why don't you put on
that hat and scarf of yours?

945
00:51:59.458 --> 00:52:00.541
It's cold outside.

946
00:52:01.958 --> 00:52:05.458
Okay, you and your family have
yourself a merry Christmas.

947
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:07.125
Uh, yeah.

948
00:52:07.208 --> 00:52:08.541
You too.

949
00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:11.226
Ah, crazy kid…

950
00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:17.125
♪ Last Christmas I
gave you my heart

951
00:52:17.208 --> 00:52:19.291
♪ But the very next day… ♪

952
00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:25.333
Whoa.

953
00:52:34.583 --> 00:52:35.750
Yeah!

954
00:52:38.416 --> 00:52:39.500
Finally!

955
00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:54.375
What are you looking at?

956
00:52:57.375 --> 00:52:59.583
- Bubby.
- Hey, hey, buddy! Look!

957
00:52:59.666 --> 00:53:01.458
The power is back on!

958
00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:02.791
Yeah.

959
00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:05.375
Greg, you found
your hat and scarf.

960
00:53:07.291 --> 00:53:09.291
Uh…

961
00:53:09.375 --> 00:53:10.958
No way.

962
00:53:11.041 --> 00:53:13.625
I finally put it all together.

963
00:53:14.208 --> 00:53:17.041
So it was you this entire time.

964
00:53:18.375 --> 00:53:19.375
Busted.

965
00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:20.809
What is going on here, Greg?

966
00:53:20.833 --> 00:53:22.416
What is your brother
talking about?

967
00:53:23.875 --> 00:53:26.041
I'm the one who
damaged that snowplow.

968
00:53:27.333 --> 00:53:28.559
What? Wait a minute.

969
00:53:28.583 --> 00:53:30.458
You knocked the
blade off that plow?

970
00:53:30.541 --> 00:53:32.625
But I-I... How?

971
00:53:32.708 --> 00:53:33.875
It was an accident.

972
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.833
Me and Rowley were
building a snowman,

973
00:53:37.916 --> 00:53:42.000
and the snowball just
kind of got away from us.

974
00:53:42.083 --> 00:53:46.583
And when it happened,
we got scared.

975
00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:48.708
So we ran.

976
00:53:53.083 --> 00:53:55.208
Seven Baker 17,
repeat, Surrey Street.

977
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:56.291
Suspect is wanted…

978
00:53:56.375 --> 00:53:58.416
What are the police doing here?

979
00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.833
I can't believe it.

980
00:53:59.916 --> 00:54:02.375
That snowplow lady sold me out.

981
00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:05.958
Man, the chafe in these
pants is ridiculous.

982
00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:13.291
Well, don't just stand there.

983
00:54:13.375 --> 00:54:14.833
Run!

984
00:54:14.916 --> 00:54:16.333
You can slip out the back door.

985
00:54:16.416 --> 00:54:17.416
I'll stall for you.

986
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.500
Good plan, Rodrick.

987
00:54:18.583 --> 00:54:20.541
And, Frank, help me
hide the evidence.

988
00:54:20.625 --> 00:54:22.000
Susan! Are you crazy?

989
00:54:22.083 --> 00:54:24.000
We can't engage in
a... a cover-up.

990
00:54:24.083 --> 00:54:25.750
We gotta tell the
police what happened.

991
00:54:26.333 --> 00:54:29.416
Frank, we are not gonna have
our family's Christmas ruined

992
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.833
by what was clearly
an innocent mistake.

993
00:54:32.583 --> 00:54:35.166
Um, okay are we... are we...
are we really doing this?

994
00:54:37.083 --> 00:54:38.375
I guess we're doing this.

995
00:54:38.458 --> 00:54:40.291
Start shredding, Rodrick.

996
00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:45.458
Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man!

997
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.309
Last seen wearing a red scarf

998
00:54:48.333 --> 00:54:51.125
and red hat.

999
00:54:51.208 --> 00:54:52.916
Guys, hey!

1000
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.875
Guys. Guys!

1001
00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:55.958
Come on!

1002
00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:57.583
- Huh?
- Wha...

1003
00:54:59.541 --> 00:55:01.625
- Huh?
- It's okay.

1004
00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:03.958
You don't need to
do this for me.

1005
00:55:04.041 --> 00:55:05.958
The thing with the
snowplow was my fault.

1006
00:55:06.041 --> 00:55:07.625
It's time for me
to face the music.

1007
00:55:12.083 --> 00:55:14.583
But if this is the end
of the road for me,

1008
00:55:15.208 --> 00:55:18.625
I just wanna say I'm
really gonna miss you guys.

1009
00:55:22.208 --> 00:55:23.208
Greg!

1010
00:55:23.708 --> 00:55:26.541
I gotta get a different
pair of snow pants.

1011
00:55:27.083 --> 00:55:28.375
Please be gentle.

1012
00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:29.958
I've got delicate wrists.

1013
00:55:30.041 --> 00:55:31.208
Huh?

1014
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:33.708
Well, hello, officers.

1015
00:55:33.791 --> 00:55:36.125
What brings you to
our house tonight?

1016
00:55:37.458 --> 00:55:38.458
Um…

1017
00:55:38.541 --> 00:55:42.875
Listen, lady, we've got a
bit of a situation here.

1018
00:55:42.958 --> 00:55:49.291
Oh, well, I-I'm sure that this was
just a complete misunderstanding.

1019
00:55:50.875 --> 00:55:52.083
Right?

1020
00:55:52.166 --> 00:55:53.583
Uh, right.

1021
00:55:53.666 --> 00:55:56.083
Uh, listen, uh, with
all the snow this week,

1022
00:55:56.166 --> 00:55:58.500
people couldn't go out
to the toy donation bin.

1023
00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:03.041
So, uh, me and my partner volunteered to
go door-to-door to collect unwanted items.

1024
00:56:03.125 --> 00:56:04.125
Oh.

1025
00:56:05.041 --> 00:56:07.375
Oh!

1026
00:56:07.458 --> 00:56:10.291
Well, that's a wonderful
idea, officers.

1027
00:56:10.375 --> 00:56:13.666
I'm so sorry we didn't make
it to the bin before tonight.

1028
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:16.708
Frank, could you run upstairs
and grab those gifts we wrapped?

1029
00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:19.625
Boys, do we have anything else
in the house we could donate?

1030
00:56:20.791 --> 00:56:21.791
Uh…

1031
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:25.458
Actually, I have something
that would be perfect.

1032
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
But can I ask you
officers for a favor?

1033
00:56:44.875 --> 00:56:46.958
Deodorant. Really?

1034
00:56:47.041 --> 00:56:49.166
Santa knows exactly
what you need.

1035
00:56:50.416 --> 00:56:51.958
Thanks, Santa.

1036
00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:56.416
I'm sorry you don't have
more to open this year.

1037
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.041
I'm good with what I got.

1038
00:56:58.125 --> 00:57:01.416
The truth is, I have
everything I need right here.

1039
00:57:02.333 --> 00:57:04.083
I'm proud of you, Greg.

1040
00:57:04.166 --> 00:57:08.125
What you did last
night was just amazing.

1041
00:57:08.666 --> 00:57:11.833
Yeah, well, that's what
Christmas is all about, right?

1042
00:57:13.416 --> 00:57:14.416
Aw, Manny.

1043
00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:26.333
- Oh! Ah! Nope!
- Come on!

1044
00:57:26.416 --> 00:57:28.250
Come and get me.

1045
00:57:28.333 --> 00:57:30.458
- Now you can't get me 'cause I'm hiding!
- Oh! Yeah!

1046
00:57:30.541 --> 00:57:31.875
- You got me.
- Whoo-hoo!

1047
00:57:31.958 --> 00:57:33.041
Thanks, Mom.

1048
00:57:33.125 --> 00:57:36.625
So, after everything I went through,
my Christmas wasn't half bad.

1049
00:57:36.708 --> 00:57:38.041
I spent the day with my family,

1050
00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:41.000
and I even had a little time
to tie up some loose ends.

1051
00:57:43.583 --> 00:57:44.875
Good riddance.

1052
00:57:46.625 --> 00:57:49.833
And in case you're thinking I
went soft by giving up my present,

1053
00:57:50.375 --> 00:57:54.541
let me just say that a new video
game system comes out every year.

1054
00:57:54.625 --> 00:57:58.791
And next time around, I won't have
anyone looking over my shoulder.

1055
00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:01.250
So I'm a lock for having my
Christmas dreams come true.

1056
00:58:01.875 --> 00:58:04.750
I just hope nobody hears about
everything that happened to my family

1057
00:58:04.833 --> 00:58:07.416
and turns it into one of
those corny holiday specials,

1058
00:58:08.083 --> 00:58:11.666
'cause that would be,
like, my worst nightmare.
