00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:52.875
[Greg] The holidays are
supposed to be special,

3
00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.166
because you get to spend time
with the people you love.

4
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.666
- But if you ask me…
- [laughs]

5
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.375
…my family spends too much
time together as it is.

6
00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:00.458
- Manny!
- Ooh.

7
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:01.941
[Greg] If you wanna
hear the truth,

8
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.583
the real meaning of the season
isn't about togetherness

9
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.791
or any of that
other corny stuff.

10
00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.583
For me, Christmas is
all about the gifts.

11
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.125
And if you're a kid,

12
00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:14.875
your only goal is to maximize the amount
of presents you get on the big day.

13

[fireworks exploding]

14
00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:19.125
The problem is, if you
want a lot of gifts,

15
00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:22.083
you have to be good during the
whole month leading up to Christmas.

16
00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.375
And it's hard to be on your best
behavior at this time of year…

17
00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:26.458

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:29.101

Not exactly naughty,
but definitely gross!

23
00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:40.000
Here's the thing. I'm getting
worried that my window

24
00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:43.250
for getting quality presents on
Christmas might be starting to close,

25
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.708

you get, the worse your gifts are.

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.833
So, if this is really my last
chance to get something I want,

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.833
I'm gonna make sure I'm good,

you find this box?

Elfrendo?

95
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.416
That's right. He's one of
Santa's most important scouts.

He reports directly to
the big man himself.

that gift that you want so badly,

you don't step out of line,

even look like a snowman.

feet tall, we'll add the next level.

Maybe we can rent a crane.

[wind whistles]

170
00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:32.000
[sighing] Oh, boy.

171
00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:34.916
Yep, always one of
these kids every year.

172
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.083
[Rowley straining]

173
00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:38.291
[strains, sighs]

174
00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.125
I think it's stuck
on something, Greg.

175
00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:42.541
[sighs] You're just
not trying hard enough.

176
00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.208
Here, move out of the way.

177
00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:46.958
You gotta do it like this.

178
00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:49.333
[grunts]

179
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.750
See? That got it moving.

180
00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.208
- [rumbling]
- Uh, Greg?

181
00:08:57.166 --> 00:08:59.750
Oh, no. Oh, man.

182
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:01.125
We ruined the lawn.

183
00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.958
What are we gonna do, Greg?

184
00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:08.041
Here, here. Help me cover
it up before someone sees.

185
00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.708
- Um, okay.
- Hurry, hurry!

186
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:15.125
[sighs] Okay, look,
if you don't move,

187
00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:19.625
I won't be able to clear the streets
so you kids can go to school tomorrow.

188
00:09:21.708 --> 00:09:24.208
Hello? Yoo-hoo.

189
00:09:25.833 --> 00:09:28.083
Oh, that can't be good.

190
00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:30.000
[laughs] Oh, yeah!

191
00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:31.833
[gasps] It's an ambush!

192
00:09:31.916 --> 00:09:35.208
- Get her!
- [children shouting]

193
00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:36.958
[Greg, Rowley grunting]

194
00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:40.875
- Okay, there. Good as new.
- [Rowley sighs]

195
00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.166
You know, I think we got a pretty
good start on this snowman.

196
00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:47.583
[children shouting]

197
00:09:47.666 --> 00:09:49.208
We're never going to school!

198
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:50.541
Stop, stop, stop it!

199
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:54.041
Hey, what do you say we go to your
place? We can get some hot chocolate.

200
00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:54.958
Yes.

201
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:58.416
It's this kind of teamwork that's gonna
score some major points with Santa.

202
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.250
[thud]

203
00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:02.416
[screams]

204
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.500
Rowley! Uh, do something?

205
00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:05.583
I got this!

206
00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:08.625
[grunting] Greg!

207
00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:09.875
Rowley!

208
00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.541
[screaming]

209
00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:14.708
Oh, no.

210
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:15.666
[car alarm blaring]

211
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.833
Uh-oh.

212
00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:19.708
[robot Santa] Ho ho...

213
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:22.541
Okay, listen!

214
00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.500
One more snowball and
I'm calling the cops!

215
00:10:26.083 --> 00:10:27.083
- Wha...
- Huh?

216
00:10:28.416 --> 00:10:30.000
- [rumbling]
- What is that?

217
00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:31.750
- Whoa!
- Uh-oh.

218
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.083
[screams]

219
00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.250
[all screaming]

220
00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:36.875
[robot Santa] Ho ho ho.

221
00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:39.958
[gasps]

222
00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:43.250
No! No, no. No,
no, no, no, no, no!

223
00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:48.375
Ho ho... Ho-Ho-Ho... Ho.

224
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.875
Ho-Ho-Ho. [distorted] Ho.

225
00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:51.958
Oh, no.

226
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.833
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

227
00:10:56.916 --> 00:10:59.666
- Of course this happens to me.
- [engine revs]

228
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:05.208
[tires squealing]

229
00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:07.500
- Come on.
- [engine revving]

230
00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.500
Come on, baby.

231
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.583
[clinks]

232
00:11:13.666 --> 00:11:16.333
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

233
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.333
Hey, you! You! Yeah, I see
you, mister red hat, red scarf!

234
00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:26.041
Stay right where you are!

235
00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:28.291
Come on, Rowley. We
need to get out of here.

236
00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:29.375
[yelps]

237
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.625
[both panting]

238
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:37.500
Hey, Greg! I think we lost her.

239
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.166
[engine revs]

240
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.458
Oh, you little twerps
think you can outrun me?

241
00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:45.166
[both screaming]

242
00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:48.458
[screaming continues]

243
00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.041
Rowley. Come on.

244
00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:51.750
We are still running.

245
00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:53.833
Hey, hey! You two,
stop right there!

246
00:11:53.916 --> 00:11:55.958
- [Rowley screams]
- [Greg grunts]

247
00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:00.250
[both grunt, scream]

248
00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:02.041
- [Greg, Rowley grunt]
- Hey!

249
00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:04.125
[both screaming]

250
00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:05.875
Whoa... Whoa!

251
00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.333
- [Rowley screaming]
- Left, left! No, go right!

252
00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:11.208
- [Rowley gasps]
- [sighs]

253
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:14.583
[both screaming]

254
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.750
[Rowley grunts]

255
00:12:18.833 --> 00:12:21.333
- [gasps]
- [tires screeching]

256
00:12:21.416 --> 00:12:23.208
[both screaming]

257
00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:26.583
[whooshing]

258
00:12:27.291 --> 00:12:28.583
What the…

259
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:36.791
[chuckles] Gotcha.

260
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.750
- [Rowley whimpers, grunts]
- [Greg grunts]

261
00:12:40.916 --> 00:12:42.583
[engine revs]

262
00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:46.166
- [engine rattling]
- [Rowley whimpering]

263
00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:52.041
- [Rowley screams]
- [chokes]

264
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.351
- [Rowley screams]
- [grunts]

265
00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:58.083
[both grunting]

266
00:12:58.166 --> 00:12:59.791
- [Rowley screaming]
- [grunts]

267
00:13:01.791 --> 00:13:04.291
- [both groan]
- [driver] I see you two!

268
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:06.125
You're in big trouble!

269
00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.375
We gotta get out of here.

270
00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:18.416
I think we should go
back. It's getting dark.

271
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.041
I'm scared, Greg.

272
00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:22.041
Are you crazy? We can't go back.

273
00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:24.541
That snowplow lady is
probably waiting for us.

274
00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:28.041
Maybe we should go back, so we
can tell her it was an accident.

275
00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.958
Don't you get it, Rowley? We
damaged government property.

276
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:34.625
We could go to jail for that.

277
00:13:34.708 --> 00:13:36.791
We shouldn't even go
back on our street.

278
00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:38.541
I can't go to jail!

279
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.333
My parents would be…

280
00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:42.458
disappointed in me!

281
00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:43.958
Well, I can't go to jail either.

282
00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:47.541
I heard they have metal toilets,
and they're right out in the open.

283
00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.625
I need my privacy when
I go to the bathroom.

284
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.333
I can't believe this.

285
00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:54.666
I was trying so hard to be good.

286
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.750
Do you think you'll still
get that video game system?

287
00:13:57.833 --> 00:13:59.083
I don't know, Rowley!

288
00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:01.166
We have other things
to deal with right now.

289
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:02.958
Uh…

290
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:08.125
So I'm pretty sure the snowplow
lady didn't get a good look at us,

291
00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:10.416
but she definitely saw
what we were wearing.

292
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.416
So we're gonna have to
ditch this winter gear

293
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.250
so no one can identify us.

294
00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:17.833
I got these earmuffs for getting
a B+ in handwriting this quarter.

295
00:14:17.916 --> 00:14:19.750
Sorry, Rowley, but
this stuff's gotta go.

296
00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:22.791
Now we just need a
place to ditch it.

297
00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:24.500
Where are we gonna do that?

298
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.750
There.

299
00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:31.583
The dumpster?

300
00:14:37.458 --> 00:14:40.208
Are you sure we have to do this?

301
00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:43.541
These earmuffs are
so warm and comfy.

302
00:14:43.625 --> 00:14:47.458
What is it gonna be? Cold
ears? Or life behind bars?

303
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.416
[Rowley groans]

304
00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:55.666
[lid creaks, slams]

305
00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:58.000
[footsteps departing]

306
00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:02.375
[owl hooting]

307
00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:04.750
[dog barking in distance]

308
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:13.166
[door creaks]

309
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.666
Oh, Greg! There you are.

310
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.875
I was starting to get
worried about you.

311
00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.333
Um…

312
00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:29.958
Me and Rowley were just out
enjoying the first big snow day.

313
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.416
I guess we lost track of time.

314
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.791
Oh, well, that's great.

315
00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:35.125
Where are your hat and scarf?

316
00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:36.708
Uh, I don't know.

317
00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:40.791
I guess I must've
dropped them in the snow.

318
00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:43.833
Oh, Greg, your Aunt
Lydia made those for you.

319
00:15:43.916 --> 00:15:46.583
Well, it would break her heart
if she found out you lost them.

320
00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:50.166
I'm sure they'll turn up when
the snow melts in the spring.

321
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.666
Oh, someone will probably
find them before then.

322
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.291
And luckily for you, Aunt Lydia stitched
your name on the inside of your hat.

323
00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:58.541
Wait. My-My name's in there?

324
00:15:58.625 --> 00:15:59.875
First and last.

325
00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:04.333
So don't worry, whoever finds your things
won't have any trouble tracking you down.

326
00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:05.458
- [Greg shudders]
- Greg?

327
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:06.625
- Uh…
- Are you okay?

328
00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:09.833
Yeah. I think I just need to
get warmed up by the fire.

329
00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:12.083
Oh, there'll be plenty of
time for that later on.

330
00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:16.000
Right now, we're going on
a holiday family outing.

331
00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:19.500
But... [scoffs] Mom, I
can't go back out there.

332
00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:22.083
You can borrow your
father's old hat and scarf.

333
00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:23.916
I don't want you
catching a cold.

334
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.500
Guys, let's go!
Holiday lights time!

335
00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:30.500

happened with the snowplow,

515
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:41.125
I figured my holidays were sunk,

516
00:24:41.208 --> 00:24:44.750
but everything changed for me
tonight when I found that gift.

517
00:24:44.833 --> 00:24:48.250
It just proves that sometimes,
good things happen to good people.

518
00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:51.625
Now, all I need to do is grab that
stuff out of the bin tomorrow,

519
00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:54.291
and it'll be smooth
sailing to Christmas.

520
00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:56.375
You know that poem about
children going to bed

521
00:24:56.458 --> 00:24:58.875
with visions of sugarplums
dancing in their heads?

522
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:03.791
Well, tonight I'll be dreaming of
something way better than candy.

523
00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:21.958
[alarm buzzing]

524
00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:26.083
What the heck?

525
00:25:26.833 --> 00:25:27.916
What the heck?

526
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.101
[weatherperson] The governor has
declared a weather emergency…

527
00:25:30.125 --> 00:25:32.791
- What the heck?
- Well, look who came to join us.

528
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:34.083
It's snowing!

529
00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.351
I guess the weather people are
right every once in a while.

530
00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:37.916
My alarm didn't go off.

531
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.083
I set it for later,
so you could sleep in.

532
00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:42.083
That's the best thing
about a snow day.

533
00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.333
More like a snow week.

534
00:25:44.416 --> 00:25:47.250
This storm's supposed to keep
going strong through Christmas Eve.

535
00:25:47.333 --> 00:25:49.083
A whole week?

536
00:25:49.166 --> 00:25:51.750
Uh, uh, I can't be
stuck inside right now.

537
00:25:51.833 --> 00:25:53.583
I've got... I've got
things I gotta do.

538
00:25:53.666 --> 00:25:55.333
Greg, where on
Earth are you going?

539
00:25:55.416 --> 00:25:57.500
I'm going to hang
out at Rowley's.

540
00:25:57.583 --> 00:25:59.166
In your pajamas?

541
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.791
Honey, it's not safe to
be outside right now.

542
00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:03.958
Mom, it's just a dusting.

543
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:06.625
I'll be back in
a few... [shouts]

544
00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:10.500
[gasps] Greg.

545
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:11.833
Bubby frozen.

546
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.166
- [shutter clicks]
- [laughs]

547
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.250
[Greg] It took me a few hours to get
my body temperature back to normal,

548
00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:19.333
but as soon as I could
feel my fingers again,

549
00:26:19.416 --> 00:26:22.666
I grabbed the phone and called Rowley
to fill him in on the new plan.

550
00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:29.833
[Rowley] ♪ Silent
night, holy night ♪

551
00:26:29.916 --> 00:26:36.583
♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪

552
00:26:36.666 --> 00:26:37.958
[phone ringing]

553
00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:39.500
Oh, I'll get it.

554
00:26:39.583 --> 00:26:40.583
Don't be long, Son.

555
00:26:40.625 --> 00:26:42.500
We'll pick up at the
start of the third verse.

556
00:26:42.583 --> 00:26:44.059
- [ringing continues]
- [Rowley] Yes, Father.

557
00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:46.708
Jefferson residence.
Rowley speaking.

558
00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:48.791
Rowley, I know you know it's me.

559
00:26:48.875 --> 00:26:51.833
I'm sorry. My mom and dad like
me to use good phone manners.

560
00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:53.750
Can you believe this snow?

561
00:26:53.833 --> 00:26:56.583
- I mean, how are you guys holding up?
- We're doing great.

562
00:26:56.666 --> 00:27:00.083
We made gingerbread cookies, and
now we're singing Christmas carols.

563
00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:03.750
[gasps] Oh, want me to put you on
speakerphone so you can join us?

564
00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:04.875
No!

565
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:06.500
I mean, no, thanks.

566
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:09.166
Listen, Rowley, we need to make
sure we're on the same page

567
00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.375
about the you-know-what.

568
00:27:11.458 --> 00:27:12.791
You mean…

569
00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:14.000
Voldemort?

570
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.791
What? That's
you-know-who, Rowley.

571
00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.958
I'm talking about the snowplow.

572
00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:22.208
Oh, yeah, that.

573
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:26.375
Look, we won't be able to get our stuff
from that bin until it stops snowing.

574
00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:28.625
We're gonna have to lay low
and keep our mouths shut.

575
00:27:28.708 --> 00:27:30.083
Got it?

576
00:27:30.166 --> 00:27:32.708
- What do you mean?
- If someone beats us to that bin,

577
00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:34.434
we're gonna have to
get our story straight.

578
00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:37.708
So, if anyone comes by your house
and starts asking questions,

579
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:40.416
you don't know how our
stuff got in there, okay?

580
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.000
But why would someone
come to my house?

581
00:27:43.083 --> 00:27:45.166
There's something I
didn't tell you before.

582
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.250
It turns out my name is
stitched inside of my hat.

583
00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:51.416
Your name? That's bad.

584
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.875
Listen, everything's gonna be
okay as long as you play dumb.

585
00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:57.166
You don't know anything
about anything.

586
00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.625
But lying would be naughty,

587
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:01.083
and I'm nice!

588
00:28:01.166 --> 00:28:02.666
Rowley, I'm not
asking you to lie.

589
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.583
Santa sent the
storm to punish us.

590
00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:07.333
- He knows. He knows!
- Rowley?

591
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:09.841
- [Greg] Can you please calm down?
- [panting]

592
00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:11.500
Just focus on the
sound of my voice.

593
00:28:11.583 --> 00:28:14.083
Maybe I'll just confess. What's
the number for the police?

594
00:28:14.166 --> 00:28:16.583
- 911, 911, 911.
- [phone beeping]

595
00:28:16.666 --> 00:28:17.976
- Rowley! Rowley!
- 911, 911, 911.

596
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.880
- Rowley, do not hang up this phone!
- 911, 911!

597
00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:21.000
- Stay on the line!
- 911!

598
00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:22.708
[electricity humming stops]

599
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:26.958
[busy signal beeping]

600
00:28:27.041 --> 00:28:28.458
Rowley?

601
00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:37.166
[Greg sighs] Well, with the power
out, Rowley can't call the cops

602
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.583
and spill his guts out
about the snowplow.

603
00:28:39.666 --> 00:28:43.083
And with the whole town snowed
under, nobody's getting to that bin.

604
00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:44.875
So, my secret's safe.

605
00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:45.958
At least for now.

606
00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:48.017
All I need to do is to make
it to Christmas morning

607
00:28:48.041 --> 00:28:50.041
without anyone in my
family catching on.

608
00:28:50.125 --> 00:28:52.916
Because in one week, I can call
that video game system mine.

609
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.333
[sighs] Okay.

610
00:28:54.416 --> 00:28:56.708
Three cases of water, 120
rolls of toilet paper,

611
00:28:56.791 --> 00:28:59.375
flashlights with fresh batteries
and plenty of canned goods.

612
00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:01.333
- Ooh.
- Check!

613
00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:06.208
Greg, you're already shivering? The
power's only been out for a half hour.

614
00:29:06.291 --> 00:29:08.125
Yeah, we're already
starting to lose heat.

615
00:29:08.208 --> 00:29:10.916
And if it gets cold enough in
here, the pipes could burst.

616
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.125
So, nobody touch the
bottled water. Just in case.

617
00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:14.041
[Manny groans]

618
00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:15.726
We might need to use it
to flush the toilets.

619
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.791
Eh, I never really flush anyway.

620
00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:19.375
Yes, Rodrick, we've noticed.

621
00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:21.166
Do we really have enough food?

622
00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.333
What if we run out?

623
00:29:22.416 --> 00:29:24.208
Well, I just went
grocery shopping.

624
00:29:24.291 --> 00:29:27.041
We'll be fine for
two weeks at least.

625
00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:30.375
I read about this family that
got snowed into their cabin,

626
00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:31.541
and to survive,

627
00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:34.083
- they had to eat each other.
- [gasps] Gross!

628
00:29:34.166 --> 00:29:35.541
Yummy.

629
00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:37.416
Rodrick! You're scaring Manny.

630
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.000
[chuckles] The last guy
felt kinda bad though.

631
00:29:40.083 --> 00:29:43.541
[sighs] Well, I think
everything's gonna be just fine.

632
00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:46.291
And the next few days
are going to be fun.

633
00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:50.541
What could be better than being snowed
in with your family for the holidays?

634
00:29:50.625 --> 00:29:52.416
Literally anything.

635
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.333
No phones, no television,
no distractions.

636
00:29:56.416 --> 00:30:01.000
Just the five of us sharing in
the joy of each other's company.

637
00:30:01.083 --> 00:30:04.166
It's a Christmas miracle.

638
00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:07.166
[shivering] So cold.

639
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.250
[Rodrick groans]

640
00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:12.291
[gasps]

641
00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:15.458
Okay, guys. Who's up for
another round of charades?

642
00:30:15.541 --> 00:30:16.708
- [Greg sighs]
- [groans]

643
00:30:16.791 --> 00:30:19.458
[chittering]

644
00:30:20.875 --> 00:30:21.708
[chittering continues]

645
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:23.250
- [Greg] Uh…
- [Rodrick] Um…

646
00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:24.500
Back to the Future?

647
00:30:24.583 --> 00:30:26.333
[chittering]

648
00:30:26.416 --> 00:30:28.375
[roaring]

649
00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:30.791
[cawing]

650
00:30:30.875 --> 00:30:33.833
- A llama?
- She did a llama yesterday, I think.

651
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.625
Or maybe that was the day
before? I... It's getting fuzzy.

652
00:30:37.708 --> 00:30:40.208
It's an alpaca, guys. Come on.

653
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:42.625
[groans] Same thing.

654
00:30:43.291 --> 00:30:45.291
Frank, we are
playing a game here.

655
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:47.541
- Would you please sit down?
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

656
00:30:47.625 --> 00:30:50.208
I-I just gotta make sure we've
got our inventory cataloged.

657
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:51.333
All right, let's see here.

658
00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:54.875
120 toilet paper rolls, three
cases of water... Wait a minute.

659
00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:58.625
There's a case missing. And
where are the cans of yams?

660
00:30:59.541 --> 00:31:00.583
Huh?

661
00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:03.458
I think one of you boys
is hoarding supplies.

662
00:31:03.541 --> 00:31:05.875
I've got a nose for yams.

663
00:31:05.958 --> 00:31:07.708
Breathe in my face.

664
00:31:07.791 --> 00:31:09.083
[screams] Whoa, whoa. [stammers]

665
00:31:09.166 --> 00:31:10.791
- Uh, um, Mom.
- [sniffing]

666
00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:12.517
- Oh, it's okay, Rodrick.
- [sniffing continues]

667
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:16.291
I think your father may be suffering
from a case of cabin fever.

668
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:18.041
N-Not so fast.

669
00:31:18.125 --> 00:31:20.041
You're not off the
hook yourself, Susan.

670
00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:24.500
- Come on. Let's have it. Breathe.
- [Susan chuckles] Okay.

671
00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:27.708
- That's enough, Frank.
- [Frank] That-That's broccoli, isn't it?

672
00:31:27.791 --> 00:31:28.791
[screams]

673
00:31:28.833 --> 00:31:29.958
Greg, what's wrong?

674
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:31.500
The elf thing moved.

675
00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:34.958
It was there a minute
ago, and now it's there.

676
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:39.125
Oh, I'm sure your mind is just
playing tricks on you, honey.

677
00:31:39.208 --> 00:31:41.500
Uh, maybe you're going
a little stir-crazy too.

678
00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:42.916
I am not going crazy.

679
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.916
That thing actually moved.

680
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.833
[Rodrick] Hmm.

681
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:50.166
Well, maybe he had an important

[Greg] I was actually kinda glad that my
family was distracted with other stuff,

703
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.500
because that gave me the chance to
stay out of sight and out of mind.

704

All right, here's how I
think it all went down.

722
00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:46.416
You and your little buddy were
in the front yard last week,

723
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.833

saw you two weaklings as easy targets.

Now, it's ours. [chuckles]

728
00:33:58.583 --> 00:34:01.383
[Rodrick] So, they stole your winter
gear, rolled you up in a snowball,

729
00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:02.708
and pushed you down the hill.

730
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:05.041
- So long, twerps!

733
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.458
But now, you and your little
friend have a problem, right?

734
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:16.791
The guys who took your stuff
are on the run from the law.

735

- [Rodrick] But they know where you live.

736

So if you rat them out for what
they did, you're both dead.

Really, Rodrick? That's
what you came up with?

Well, I, uh... I'm still
working out the details.

739

But it's just a matter of time before
I find out what happened for sure.

Yes, Greg, on our doorbell.
It's got a camera in it.

And everything that happens on
the street in front of our house

00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:31.083
Where could you be?

856
00:39:31.166 --> 00:39:33.083
I checked in the
garage. He's not there.

857
00:39:33.166 --> 00:39:36.291
I couldn't find him in any
of his regular hiding spots.

858
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:37.916
[groans] He's not in his room.

859
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.333
He wasn't in the
bathroom either,

860
00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:43.416
but I'd suggest you all give it a good
20 minutes before you go in there.

861
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.250
You don't think he's out there?

862
00:39:46.333 --> 00:39:48.333
[wind howling]

863
00:39:49.875 --> 00:39:53.791
My precious baby, out
in the storm alone.

864
00:39:53.875 --> 00:39:55.583
[electronic music
playing, faint]

865
00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:57.833
- Do you guys hear…
- Music?

866
00:39:57.916 --> 00:39:59.916
[music continues]

867
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.541
[all] Huh?

868
00:40:06.583 --> 00:40:07.791
Manny.

869
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.500
Uh-oh.

870
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.916
So, that's where all
the supplies went.

871
00:40:14.416 --> 00:40:16.875
Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

872
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.500
Huh. Respect.

873
00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:21.583
[music ends]

874
00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:25.875
Okay.

875
00:40:25.958 --> 00:40:27.583
And there we go.

876
00:40:27.666 --> 00:40:30.916
- This little guy is not going anywhere.
- [scoffs]

877
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.125
Well, can you blame him, Frank?

878
00:40:33.208 --> 00:40:35.041
He was just looking
out for himself.

879
00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:37.791
The whole experience has
probably scarred him.

880
00:40:37.875 --> 00:40:40.166
[humming]

881
00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:42.041
Seems fine to me.

882
00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:44.625
Could we please
lighten up, guys?

883
00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.791
Things could be a
whole lot worse.

884
00:40:46.875 --> 00:40:49.625
Um, how exactly?

885
00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:50.958
Well…

886
00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:52.708
[water dripping]

887
00:40:52.791 --> 00:40:54.333
There could be…

888
00:40:54.416 --> 00:40:55.750
[electricity crackles]

889
00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:57.083
We could…

890
00:40:57.166 --> 00:40:58.666
[screams]

891
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:03.916
Yeah, this really is
rock bottom, I guess.

892
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.625
I suppose, I got a
little carried away too.

893
00:41:06.708 --> 00:41:08.333
Especially with the yams.

894
00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:09.500
You can say that again.

895
00:41:10.166 --> 00:41:11.750
[imitating Frank]
Breathe in my face.

896
00:41:12.291 --> 00:41:14.416
[Frank, Greg laughing]

897
00:41:16.375 --> 00:41:19.208
[all laughing]

898
00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:21.375
What are yams exactly, anyway?

899
00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:22.458
[Frank laughs]

900
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:23.541
I don't know,

901
00:41:24.416 --> 00:41:25.666
but they're delicious.

902
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.166
[Greg, Rodrick laugh]

903
00:41:29.375 --> 00:41:32.458
I know this wasn't the Christmas
season we were hoping for, guys.

904
00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:34.833
But at least we'll
never forget it.

905
00:41:34.916 --> 00:41:36.250
Hope you're wrong about that.

906
00:41:36.333 --> 00:41:38.250
I'm already trying to
scrub it from my brain.

907
00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:41.333
Well, maybe there's still time
to turn things around tonight.

908
00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:44.250
What do you say we try
and have a little fun?

909
00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:47.375
Oh, please, not charades again.

910
00:41:47.458 --> 00:41:50.041
Now, I know it's not
officially Christmas yet,

911
00:41:50.125 --> 00:41:53.208
but what do you guys think about
getting a little sneak preview?

912
00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:54.958
- Yeah!
- Hey, all right!

913
00:41:55.041 --> 00:41:57.916
Everyone can pick out
one gift to open tonight.

914
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.333
But choose carefully

915
00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.208
because you're gonna have to make
it last until tomorrow morning.

916
00:42:07.166 --> 00:42:10.000
Uh-uh-uh. You might wanna wait
till the electricity's back on

917
00:42:10.083 --> 00:42:11.416
to open that one, Greg.

918
00:42:12.416 --> 00:42:13.750
You're a good kid.

919
00:42:13.833 --> 00:42:15.000
You've earned it.

920
00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:24.458
[paper rips]

921
00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.708
[sighs] Clothes? Seriously?

922
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:31.125
Oh, Aunt Lydia made you
another hat and scarf.

923
00:42:31.208 --> 00:42:32.458
Can I pick again?

924
00:42:32.541 --> 00:42:34.958
Now you don't need someone
to find your old ones.

925
00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:37.081
- [Christmas music playing]
- [chuckles] Look, Greg.

926
00:42:37.125 --> 00:42:38.541
Aunt Lydia is upping her game.

927
00:42:39.791 --> 00:42:40.916
[groans]

928
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.041
[Frank] Uh, guys? Guys?

929
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.458
Did it stop snowing?

930
00:42:45.166 --> 00:42:46.166
[Susan, Greg gasp]

931
00:42:48.625 --> 00:42:49.875
[footsteps approaching]

932
00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:54.166
[gasps] It's a
Christmas miracle!

933
00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:55.500
All right! [laughs]

934
00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:56.583
- Yes!
- Yes!

935
00:42:57.916 --> 00:42:59.750
Huh. Check it out. Cops.

936
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:00.833
What?

937
00:43:01.833 --> 00:43:03.726
[Susan] They must be going
to collect those toys.

938
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.541
Frank, we never turned in our
donation for the toy drive.

939
00:43:07.625 --> 00:43:10.750
Wait, what do the police have
to do with the toy drive?

940
00:43:10.833 --> 00:43:13.833
The police are the ones who
collect the donations from the bin

941
00:43:13.916 --> 00:43:15.625
and get them to the
families in need.

942
00:43:15.708 --> 00:43:19.625
Isn't it wonderful that they sacrifice
their personal time to do that?

943
00:43:19.708 --> 00:43:21.708
[echoing]

944
00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:26.375
Hmm. Looks like it
belongs to Greg Heffley.

945
00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:28.458
- [radio crackles]
- Uh, Bravo 6,

946
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:32.416
we've identified the suspect as
notorious troublemaker Gregory Heffley.

947
00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.767
[dispatcher] Copy
that. Lock him up.

948
00:43:33.791 --> 00:43:34.958
[door buzzes]

949
00:43:35.041 --> 00:43:39.375
I hope you're proud of
what ya did, Greg Heffley.

950
00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:41.750
Oh, and Merry Christmas!

951
00:43:41.833 --> 00:43:44.333
[chuckles] I hope you
like your present.

952
00:43:44.958 --> 00:43:47.541
It looks like you're
gonna have to share!

953
00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:51.250
[laughing]

954
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.166
[Elfrendo laughing]

955
00:43:56.958 --> 00:43:58.958
[laughing continues]

956
00:44:01.958 --> 00:44:03.208
[groans]

957
00:44:04.416 --> 00:44:05.416
Greg, are you okay?

958
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.250
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

959
00:44:07.958 --> 00:44:09.958
I think I need to go
upstairs and lay down.

960
00:44:11.375 --> 00:44:12.875
I don't feel so good.

961
00:44:12.958 --> 00:44:14.166
Sure, honey.

962
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.250
Get some rest.

963
00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:17.625
I hope you feel better
for the big day tomorrow.

964
00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:21.791
[gulps]

965
00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:24.666
Probably too many yams.

966
00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:31.125
[Greg] I knew that if I didn't get
to that bin before the cops did,

967
00:44:31.208 --> 00:44:33.083
I was gonna spend my
Christmas in the slammer.

968
00:44:33.166 --> 00:44:38.166
So, I mustered up my courage and headed
out into the dark, cold night on my own.

969
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:41.291
It's go time.

970
00:44:41.375 --> 00:44:44.875
[Christmas music playing]

971
00:44:44.958 --> 00:44:46.416
[sighs] You gotta be kidding me.

972
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.780
- [switch clicks]
- [music stops]

973
00:45:01.083 --> 00:45:03.083
[Rowley snoring]

974
00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:06.750
- [snowball thuds]
- [gasps]

975
00:45:06.833 --> 00:45:07.833
[moans]

976
00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:09.500
- [snowball thuds]
- [shouts]

977
00:45:09.583 --> 00:45:11.750
[moans, shouts]

978
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:13.333
Uh…

979
00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:15.750
[moans]

980
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.916
Uh, what's out there, Joshie?

981
00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:21.125
[gasps, sighs]

982
00:45:21.208 --> 00:45:22.625
Hey! Greg?

983
00:45:23.625 --> 00:45:26.250
Sorry. I didn't know how
else to get your attention.

984
00:45:26.333 --> 00:45:28.166
It's Christmas Eve.

985
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:29.333
Shouldn't you be in bed?

986
00:45:29.416 --> 00:45:31.625
[Greg] In bed? But
it's only 7:30.

987
00:45:31.708 --> 00:45:34.458
I like to be asleep in
case Santa comes early.

988
00:45:34.541 --> 00:45:35.875
Well, I need your help.

989
00:45:35.958 --> 00:45:37.500
This is bigger than Santa.

990
00:45:37.583 --> 00:45:40.250
[gasps] Nothing's
bigger than Santa.

991
00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:43.833
The police are gonna empty
out that toy bin tonight.

992
00:45:43.916 --> 00:45:47.000
And my name is stitched
on the inside of that hat.

993
00:45:47.083 --> 00:45:49.875
But I'm already in
my footie pajamas.

994
00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:52.541
Well, enjoy your last
night of freedom.

995
00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:56.541
Because once they've got me, they're
gonna wanna know who my accomplice is.

996
00:45:56.625 --> 00:45:57.625
[gasps]

997
00:45:58.166 --> 00:45:59.583
Rowley.

998
00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:06.375
[Rowley straining]

999
00:46:06.458 --> 00:46:07.583
Rowley.

1000
00:46:09.791 --> 00:46:11.333
Let's do this.

1001
00:46:11.416 --> 00:46:12.458
[grunts]

1002
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.708
Whoa. Are you all right, buddy?

1003
00:46:16.375 --> 00:46:17.666
Yeah. [grunts]

1004
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.416
All right. That's my pal.

1005
00:46:21.416 --> 00:46:23.392
- [Rowley panting, gasps]
- [dispatcher] Seven Adam 15.

1006
00:46:23.416 --> 00:46:25.375
Vehicle has been
dispatched to the scene.

1007
00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:28.708
- No reports from downtown…
- [whimpering]

1008
00:46:30.375 --> 00:46:31.375
[grunts]

1009
00:46:32.666 --> 00:46:34.416
[panting]

1010
00:46:37.458 --> 00:46:40.041
[bell tolls]

1011
00:46:41.125 --> 00:46:42.708
Uh, Greg?

1012
00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.958
Where did the donation bin go?

1013
00:46:46.208 --> 00:46:49.125
- [sighs] The storm's completely buried it.
- [wind whistling]

1014
00:46:49.208 --> 00:46:50.625
That's why I brought these.

1015
00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.541
Come on. It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

1016
00:46:54.583 --> 00:46:56.833
[Rowley] I think it was
under this lamppost, Greg.

1017
00:46:56.916 --> 00:46:58.916
[Greg] No, I'm pretty
sure it was over here.

1018
00:46:59.666 --> 00:47:01.666
[both grunting]

1019
00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:07.000
Um, maybe over here?

1020
00:47:07.083 --> 00:47:08.083
[sighs]

1021
00:47:09.291 --> 00:47:10.291
[Rowley groans]

1022
00:47:10.375 --> 00:47:11.541
Let's try over there.

1023
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.833
[Rowley whimpers, grunts]

1024
00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:18.375
[grunts] We're never
going to find it.

1025
00:47:18.458 --> 00:47:20.375
We should just…
[sighs] …give up.

1026
00:47:20.458 --> 00:47:22.208
[sighs] That bin's
gotta be here!

1027
00:47:22.833 --> 00:47:24.000
[shovel clangs]

1028
00:47:27.041 --> 00:47:29.125
Ha! I knew I'd find it.

1029
00:47:29.208 --> 00:47:31.500
It's always in the last place
you look, right? [laughs]

1030
00:47:31.583 --> 00:47:32.809
- [Rowley] But, Greg, I...

Yo-You're just a kid.

1053
00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.500
[scoffs] Honey, shouldn't
you be home on Christmas Eve?

1054
00:48:32.041 --> 00:48:37.708
Uh, I was just making sure the
police could get to the bin

1055
00:48:37.791 --> 00:48:39.541
so they could collect the toys.

1056
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.458
You know, for the kids.

1057
00:48:47.083 --> 00:48:50.666
I was supposed to clear this lot
a few days ago, but I couldn't.

1058
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:52.416
Someone broke my plow.

1059
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.666
I was gonna try and
shovel it by hand.

1060
00:48:55.291 --> 00:48:57.125
You saved me a lot
of time tonight, kid.

1061

Christmas and all that.

1063

Well, I think you can feel
pretty good about this one.

you can get back home to your family?

good for Christmas this year?

1069
00:49:25.416 --> 00:49:27.666
Yeah. A new video game system.

Oh, man, you lucky dog.

1071
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:31.875
Yeah, my Tyler
wanted one of those,

1072
00:49:31.958 --> 00:49:35.375
but I'm gonna have to save up my pennies
before I can afford something like that.

1073
00:49:35.458 --> 00:49:37.041
But next year though. Next year.

1074
00:49:37.125 --> 00:49:40.583

hours in this old bucket of bolts.

You gotta be kidding me!

1080

That's the street where
my plow got busted.

1081
00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:54.333
And you know what? They never did
catch those hooligans that did it.

1082

So, is this plowing stuff,

1083

Oh, this? No.

1084
00:50:00.458 --> 00:50:03.250
[chuckles] No, I just do this
on the side for extra cash.

1085
00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.666
It helps this time of year.

1086
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:11.291
You know, there weren't a lot
of toys in that donation bin.

1087
00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:14.125
Do you think the cops will
even bother handing them out?

1088
00:50:14.208 --> 00:50:16.416
Oh, yeah, no, sure, they'll
take whatever's in there,

1089
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.958
and they'll get it out to the
kids that need it the most.

1090
00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:22.208
Hey, lots of families depend
on those donations, you know?

1091
00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:24.041
Mine included.

1092
00:50:26.666 --> 00:50:28.083

me totally nuts lately.

1099

Let me give you a
little advice, kid.

1100
00:50:46.916 --> 00:50:49.791
My family made me crazy
when I was your age too.

1101
00:50:49.875 --> 00:50:52.708
I mean, they drove me bananas.

1102

But boy do I miss 'em now.

1103

you have with those people

just a complete misunderstanding.

Uh, right.

1207
00:55:53.666 --> 00:55:56.083
Uh, listen, uh, with
all the snow this week,

1208
00:55:56.166 --> 00:55:58.500
people couldn't go out
to the toy donation bin.

1209
00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:03.041
So, uh, me and my partner volunteered to
go door-to-door to collect unwanted items.

1210
00:56:03.125 --> 00:56:04.125
[Frank, Susan] Oh.

1211

[all] Oh!

1212
00:56:07.458 --> 00:56:10.291
Well, that's a wonderful
idea, officers.

1213
00:56:10.375 --> 00:56:13.666
I'm so sorry we didn't make
it to the bin before tonight.

1214
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:16.708
Frank, could you run upstairs
and grab those gifts we wrapped?

1215
00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:19.625
Boys, do we have anything else
in the house we could donate?

1216
00:56:20.791 --> 00:56:21.791
Uh…

1217
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:25.458
Actually, I have something
that would be perfect.

1218
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
But can I ask you
officers for a favor?

What you did last
night was just amazing.

Thanks, Mom.

[Greg] So, after everything I went
through, my Christmas wasn't half bad.

1244
00:57:36.708 --> 00:57:38.041
I spent the day with my family,

1245
00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:41.000
and I even had a little time
to tie up some loose ends.

1246
00:57:43.583 --> 00:57:44.875
- [lid closes]
- Good riddance.

1247
00:57:46.625 --> 00:57:49.833
And in case you're thinking I
went soft by giving up my present,

1248
00:57:50.375 --> 00:57:54.541
let me just say that a new video
game system comes out every year.

1249
00:57:54.625 --> 00:57:58.791
And next time around, I won't have
anyone looking over my shoulder.

1250
00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:01.250
So I'm a lock for having my
Christmas dreams come true.

1251
00:58:01.875 --> 00:58:04.750
I just hope nobody hears about
everything that happened to my family

1252
00:58:04.833 --> 00:58:07.416
and turns it into one of
those corny holiday specials,

1253
00:58:08.083 --> 00:58:11.666
'cause that would be,
like, my worst nightmare.
