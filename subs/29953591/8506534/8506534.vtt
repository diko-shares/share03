1303
00:58:36.747 --> 00:58:38.716
and they're on the other end.

1304
00:58:38.783 --> 00:58:42.720

1312
00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:06.577
<i>You would go downstairs,</i>

1313
00:59:06.644 --> 00:59:10.781
and there was this
blue velvet--rock and roll--

1314
00:59:10.848 --> 00:59:13.150
big sofa.
<i>- All right.</i>

1315
00:59:13.217 --> 00:59:15.352
<i>Well, almost always,
Roy Orbison was there</i>

1316
00:59:15.419 --> 00:59:17.655
<i>because he was
our next door neighbor.</i>

1317
00:59:17.722 --> 00:59:19.724

all done up
like George and Tammy.

1319
00:59:21.759 --> 00:59:24.862

1320
