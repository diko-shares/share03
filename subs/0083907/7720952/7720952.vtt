00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:10.904
<i>I sent you 20 letters
from Paris last year</i>

2
00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:13.156
<i>Well, you've been gone six months</i>

3
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.033
<i>And I got the fear</i>

4
00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:18.620
<i>After all the songs
that we've sung together</i>

5
00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:21.707
<i>After all the sweet
and all the stormy...</i>

6
00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:27.421
<i>If I knew where you were</i>

7
00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.631
<i>Well, I would surely inform you that...</i>

8
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.345
<i>But every night don't you</i>

9
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.430
<i>Sleep on your right?</i>

10
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.181
<i>Don't you...</i>

11
00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:43.478
Hey, Ash, where are we?

12
00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.772
Well, we just crossed
the Tennessee border.

13
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.865
- Which would put us...
- Yeah?

14
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.372
Which would put us...

15
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.879
fight"

16
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.799
here.

17
00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.260
Turn!

18
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.851
What the hell was that?
Are you trying to kill us?

19
00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.020
Hey, don't blame me!
It's your steering wheel.

20
00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.647
The damn thing jerked
right out of my hand!

21
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.524
I don't understand, I had this thing in
for a tune-up yesterday

22
00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:30.859
and they said they'd go over everything.

23
00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:33.111
Yeah, well, you'd better take it back
'cause the damn thing don't work.

24
00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.489
The only thing that does work
is this lousy horn.

25
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.870
Aw, go to hell! I'm not honking at you!

26
00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.875
Jesus Christ.

27
00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.336
Hey, Scotty,
what's this place like anyway?

28
00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.464
Well, the guy that's renting it
says it's an old place--

29
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:56.677
a little run down,
but it's right up in the mountains.

30
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.262
And the best part is we get it so cheap.

31
00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.431
Yeah, why are we getting it so cheap?

32
00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.101
Well, I don't know.
Might be in real bad shape.

33
00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.770
You mean, nobody's seen this place yet?

34
00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:07.938
Well, not yet.

35
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.149
- Well, it might not be that bad.
- No.

36
00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:14.403
- Actually, it might be kinda nice.
- Yeah.

37
00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.363
It's probably a real pit.

38
00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:19.157
Hey, I think this is where we get off.

39
00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.748
This is the bridge
we're gonna cross?

40
00:03:26.832 --> 00:03:29.584
Jesus Christ, the whole thing's
falling apart on us!

41
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:34.089
Don't let the noise fool you, girls.
This thing is solid as a rock.

42
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.852
It's supposed to be one of these on here.

43
00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.032
- Come on. Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

44
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:49.743
Hey.

45
00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:21.584
<i>Join us.</i>

46
00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.756
<i>Join us...</i>

47
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.249
Dead bodies in the cellar.

48
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.711
- Dead bodies in the cellar.
- Will you stop it?

49
00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:51.382
I would like very much to make
a toast here for all this evening.

50
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:52.967
- Yeah.
- That sounds all right.

51
00:09:55.136 --> 00:09:59.390
Uh, as a Greek friend of mine once said...

52
00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:03.269
he said, "I..."

53
00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.689
No, okay, okay, okay.

54
00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:09.984
"Nis, nis--

55
00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:13.655
tu-- tu-- tu-tar-im."

56
00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:17.158
- Which means?
- "Party down." Yeah!

57
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.142
What is this?

58
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.270
Whatever it is, it's still down there.

59
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:49.274
I don't like cellars.
Let's just close it up.

60
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.068
It's probably just some animal.

61
00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:55.029
An animal? An animal?!

62
00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.783
That is the stupidest thing
I ever heard of.

63
00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:00.618
Jesus Christ.

64
00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:03.329
Well, there's something down there.

65
00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:07.584
Well, maybe it is just some animal.

66
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:11.880
Yeah, you're probably right.
It's probably just some animal.

67
00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.923
Here, Cheryl. Why don't you go down
and check to make sure?

68
00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:16.551
Scotty, I'm not going down there!

69
00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:19.804
Okay okay, you cowards. I'll go.

70
00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.139
Be careful.

71
00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.104
Back in a minute.

72
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:52.587
Hey-- hey, Scotty, you find anything?

73
00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:56.466
Scotty?

74
00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:02.472
Scotty!

75
00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.062
Scott!

76
00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:14.776
He's just kidding around.

77
00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.239
- Isn't he?
- Scotty!

78
00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:24.953
Scott! Linda, get me a flashlight.

79
00:12:25.036 --> 00:12:26.788
Well, that's the only one we brought up.

80
00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:27.914
Then get the lantern.

81
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.661
Scotty?

82
00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.363
Boo!

83
00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.618
Hey, come here.
I want to show you something.

84
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:15.289
Look at all this stuff.

85
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.051
I bet this still shoots.

86
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.803
Probably does.

87
00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.180
Oh! God!

88
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:42.733
Oh, God.

89
00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:44.068
Look at this.

90
00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:02.253
Look at this.

91
00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:16.100
This kind of looks
like your old girlfriend.

92
00:16:18.895 --> 00:16:21.355
Come on,
let's take this stuff upstairs.

93
00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.941
I'll grab the recorder
and you get everything else.

94
00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.151
Yeah, okay.

95
00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.082
This guy was
a real turd, you know?

96
00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.250
Everybody hated him.

97
00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.669
Like you kind of, right?

98
00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:46.005
Yeah, just like me.
I'm gonna break your face.

99
00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:48.841
Also, he was into this Western stuff.

100
00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.384
He makes all these little models--

101
00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:54.055
Okay, shh. Listen to this.

102
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.183
This is the tape I found downstairs.

103
00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:01.145
<i>It has been a number of years</i>

104
00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:06.609
<i>since I began excavating the ruins
of Ca 'n Dar with a group of my colleagues.</i>

105
00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.529
<i>Now my wife and I have
retreated to a small cabin</i>

106
00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.240
<i>in the solitude of these mountains.</i>

107
00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:14.951
<i>Here I continued my research undisturbed</i>

108
00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:18.287
<i>by the myriad distractions
of modern civilization</i>

109
00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:21.374
<i>and far from the groves of academe.</i>

110
00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:26.462
<i>I believe I have made</i> a <i>significant find
in the Ca 'n Darian ruins:</i>

111
00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.382
a <i>volume of ancient Sumerian
burial practices</i>

112
00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:32.051
<i>and funerary incantations.</i>

113
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.221
<i>It is entitled Naturan Demanto.</i>

114
00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.224
<i>Roughly translated-- "Book of the Dead."</i>

115
00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:42.770
<i>The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.</i>

116
00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:48.442
<i>It deals with demons, demon resurrection,</i>

117
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:52.363
<i>and those forces which roam the forest
and dark bowers of man's domain.</i>

118
00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:57.702
<i>The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures may lie dormant,</i>

119
00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.621
<i>but are never truly dead.</i>

120
00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.832
<i>They may be recalled to active life</i>

121
00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.626
<i>through the incantations
presented in this book.</i>

122
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.462
<i>It is through recitation of these passages</i>

123
00:18:08.546 --> 00:18:12.049
<i>that the demons are given license
to possess the living.</i>

124
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.053
Hey, what'd you do that for?
It was just getting good.

125
00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.264
I just don't wanna
hear it anymore, that's all.

126
00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:24.895
Scott, come on.
Leave her alone, man.

127
00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:27.773
Hey, come on. I just wanna hear
the rest of it.

128
00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:29.442
No big deal.

136
00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:56.844

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:00.431
Shut it off!

Oh, my God!

140
00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:08.731
Cheryl.

141
00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.941
- Where are you going?
- I can't believe this.

142
00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.903
Scott, you knew not to play that.

143
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.780
I mean, come on,
you knew it was upsetting her.

144
00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:17.615
You just don't know when
you're taking something too far.

145
00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:19.659
Hey, don't give me that.
You were playing it, too.

146
00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:21.577
You could have shut it off.

147
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:25.289
I mean, big deal! She's nuts.

148
00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:27.166
I mean, it's just a joke. Come on.

149
00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:31.462
Jesus Christ, she acts like she's
three years old or something.

150
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:50.147
Listen, why don't we stay up for a while
and listen to the storm?

151
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.816
All right, yeah.

152
00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:54.110
Let me check on Cheryl first
to make sure she's okay.

153
00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.444
Okay.

154
00:20:57.715 --> 00:20:59.216
A-ha!

155
00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:03.262
Oh! Stealing from the blind, huh?

156
00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.475
It's for you.

157
00:21:20.154 --> 00:21:22.114
Ash, how sweet of you.

158
00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:26.827
- Would you put it on?
- Oh, sure.

159
00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:31.749
I was gonna give it to you
before we came up here,

160
00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:34.752
but things got so hectic.

161
00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:38.214
This is really the first chance
we've had to be alone.

162
00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:43.552
Take a look.

163
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.767
Oh, Ash, it's beautiful.

164
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:54.063
I really love it. I'll never take it off.

- Yeah, what's the matter with you?

176
00:29:55.752 --> 00:29:57.129
Did something in the woods
do this to you?

177
00:29:57.212 --> 00:30:00.215
No, it was the woods themselves.

178
00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:03.343
They're alive, Ashley.
The trees, they're alive!

179
00:30:03.427 --> 00:30:05.971
Ash, why don't I take her
in the back room so she can lie down?

180
00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:09.391
I'm not lying down!
I wanna get out of here!

181
00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:11.560
I wanna leave this place right now.

182
00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.603
- Right now, Ashley.
- Wait a minute.

183
00:30:13.687 --> 00:30:15.689
I sure as hell am not leaving
any place tonight.

184
00:30:15.772 --> 00:30:17.316
- Cheryl.
- Cheryl.

185
00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:19.651
Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
Trees do not attack people.

186
00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:22.195
Ashley, will you drive me
into town or not?

187
00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:24.156
What, right now?

188
00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:26.116
Yeah. Look, sure, sure,
I'll take you into town,

189
00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:29.536
- but just listen to what you're saying.
- I don't care how it sounds.

190
00:30:29.619 --> 00:30:32.080
I wanna get out of this place right now.

191
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:36.084
Okay, you can stay
somewhere in town tonight.

192
00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:21.755
Come on, come on, come on.

193
00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:49.199
I know it's not gonna start.
It's not gonna let us leave.

194
00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:45.922
Why are you stopping?

195
00:32:47.591 --> 00:32:48.842
Wait here a minute.

196
00:32:59.603 --> 00:33:01.688
Do you see something?

197
00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.485
Where you going?!

198
00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:11.656
Ashley?

199
00:33:24.252 --> 00:33:25.504
Ashley?

200
00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:21.518
Oh! Oh!

201
00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.401
- It's not gonna let us go!
- What?

202
00:34:29.484 --> 00:34:32.362
It's not gonna let us go! I told you!

203
00:34:32.445 --> 00:34:35.031
I told you, it's not gonna let us go!

204
00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:37.367
Why won't you listen to me?

205
00:34:51.965 --> 00:34:56.511
<i>I know now that my wife
has become host to</i> a Ca <i>'n Darian demon.</i>

206
00:34:56.595 --> 00:35:00.765
<i>I fear that the only way to stop those
possessed by the spirits of the book</i>

207
00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:03.977
<i>is through the act
of bodily dismemberment.</i>

208
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.689
<i>I would leave now to avoid this horror,
but for myself I--</i>

209
00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:10.692
<i>I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods,</i>

210
00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:14.946
<i>and I have no doubt that whatever
I have resurrected through this book</i>

211
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.617
<i>is sure to come calling for me.</i>

212
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.621
Okay, let me think. Um... It's a seven.

213
00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:24.873
- What suit?
- Um... diamonds.

214
00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.916
No, no, no, wait. Uh, hearts.

215
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.294
Oh my God. Seven of hearts, you're right.

216
00:35:29.377 --> 00:35:31.963
Hey, Ash, I guessed the card right.

217
00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:34.132
Yeah, truly amazing, Linda.

218
00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:35.342
I don't know, I don't know,

219
00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:37.427
but I think it's really some sort
of extra sense or something.

220
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.471
- You know, like ESP?
- Okay, try this.

221
00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:43.016
- Okay, um... it's a seven.
- I don't believe it.

222
00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:47.062
Of spades-- queen of spades.

223
00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:52.400
Four of hearts,

224
00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:54.194
eight of spades,

225
00:35:54.277 --> 00:35:58.114
two of spades, jack of diamonds,

226
00:35:58.198 --> 00:35:59.449
jack of clubs.

227
00:36:02.077 --> 00:36:05.413
Why have you
disturbed our sleep,

228
00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:09.626
awakened us from our ancient slumber?

229
00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:13.672
You will die like the others before you!

230
00:36:14.673 --> 00:36:18.468
One by one, we will take you.

231
00:36:30.522 --> 00:36:33.024
What happened to her?

232
00:36:33.108 --> 00:36:34.776
Cheryl?

233
00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:38.655
Cheryl?

234
00:36:42.158 --> 00:36:44.619
Did you see her eyes?

235
00:36:44.703 --> 00:36:47.205
Ash, I'm scared. What's wrong with her?

236
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.841
Cheryl, stop it!

237
00:38:02.322 --> 00:38:06.159
Join us. Join us...

238
00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:40.336
Ash, I think we ought to get out of here.

239
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.881
Yeah.

240
00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:46.301
We still have a few more hours
before morning.

241
00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:49.596
I don't think I can wait that long.

242
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:53.016
You have to. We all have to.

243
00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:56.227
And then in the morning,
we'll get in the car

244
00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:58.104
and we'll take the bridge.

245
00:39:58.187 --> 00:39:59.814
And...

246
00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:04.652
Why does she keep making
those horrible noises?

247
00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:06.029
I don't know!

248
00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.199
What about her eyes?

249
00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:12.702
What about her eyes?

250
00:40:14.203 --> 00:40:18.583
For God's sake,
what happened to her eyes?!

251
00:40:33.348 --> 00:40:34.641
Everything's gonna be all right.

252
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:57.121
Scotty, I-- I think
there's something out there.

253
00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:09.509
Go to bed and get some sleep, okay?

254
00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:01.329
Shelly?

255
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:05.393
No! Don't burn her! Get her out!

256
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:08.938
No!

257
00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:13.609
Thank you.

258
00:44:13.693 --> 00:44:16.779
I don't know what I would have done

259
00:44:16.863 --> 00:44:20.867
if I had remained on those hot coals,

260
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.327
burning my pretty flesh.

261
00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:25.580
You have pretty skin.

262
00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:29.375
Give it to us!

263
00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:44.849
Join us! Join us!

264
00:44:55.902 --> 00:44:58.404
Join us!

265
00:45:23.012 --> 00:45:25.264
No, no, no!

266
00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:32.641
Hit her.

267
00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:34.810
Hit her!

268
00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:37.563
Hit it!

269
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:46.906
Let go! No, no!

270
00:47:46.989 --> 00:47:49.700
You love her! No!

271
00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:57.416
No, you love her! Don't do it!

272
00:48:30.574 --> 00:48:32.118
Scott?

273
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.705
Yeah?

274
00:48:36.789 --> 00:48:40.418
What is-- what are we gonna do?

275
00:48:43.671 --> 00:48:44.922
We're gonna bury her.

276
00:48:46.674 --> 00:48:48.551
You can't bury Shelly.

277
00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:51.595
- She's a-- she's a friend of ours.
- Ash, she's dead.

278
00:48:54.265 --> 00:48:55.766
Shelly's dead.

279
00:48:59.353 --> 00:49:01.105
We gotta bury her now.

280
00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:02.333
Linda's still sleeping.

281
00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:04.418
- I think once her leg's--
- I'm getting out of here.

282
00:50:04.502 --> 00:50:07.796
Scott, we can't take Linda anywhere
with her leg like that.

283
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.591
We don't even know if there is
any other way back besides the bridge.

284
00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:13.302
Well, maybe there's a hiking trail,
or an old road,

285
00:50:13.385 --> 00:50:14.803
or some other way around the cliff.

286
00:50:16.055 --> 00:50:19.266
I mean, there's gotta be another way
besides the bridge.

287
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.018
Listen to me.

288
00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:23.979
Linda cannot walk with her leg like that.
She can't even stand up.

289
00:50:25.397 --> 00:50:28.567
Well, then we'll leave her here
until we can send somebody back.

290
00:50:28.651 --> 00:50:29.860
What are you, crazy?

291
00:50:29.944 --> 00:50:31.654
- Scott--
- Look, I'm gettin' out!

292
00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:34.698
I don't care what happens to her.

293
00:50:34.782 --> 00:50:37.826
She's your girlfriend.
You take care of her.

294
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:39.662
I'm getting the hell
out of here right now.

295
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:04.144
Soon all of you will be like me

296
00:51:04.228 --> 00:51:06.438
and then we will lock you up
in the cellar!

297
00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:00.993
My God, Ash!

298
00:52:01.076 --> 00:52:02.369
Ash.

299
00:52:02.453 --> 00:52:04.580
- Oh my God.
- Help me.

300
00:52:06.332 --> 00:52:09.627
Yes, help me. Yes.

301
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:13.422
Did you fall, or what?

302
00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:20.179
Scotty, you're gonna be okay.

303
00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:22.556
You're gonna be just fine, you'll see.

304
00:52:33.609 --> 00:52:36.779
Ash, it's not gonna let us leave.

305
00:52:36.862 --> 00:52:40.532
Cheryl-- Cheryl was right.

306
00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:45.162
- We're all gonna die here.
- No, we're not gonna die.

307
00:52:45.245 --> 00:52:48.666
We're all gonna die, all of us.

308
00:52:48.749 --> 00:52:51.001
No, we're not gonna die.

309
00:52:51.085 --> 00:52:53.754
We're not gonna die!
We're gonna get outta here!

310
00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:57.549
Now listen to me, Scotty.
ls there a way around the bridge?

311
00:52:58.801 --> 00:53:00.302
Scotty!

312
00:53:00.386 --> 00:53:02.304
Listen to me, please! For God's sake!

313
00:53:02.388 --> 00:53:04.515
Scott!

314
00:53:04.598 --> 00:53:07.810
- Come on.
- Ash...

315
00:53:07.893 --> 00:53:10.854
Ash, I don't wanna die.

316
00:53:10.938 --> 00:53:12.856
You're not gonna leave me,
are you, Ash?

317
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.609
- Are you?
- "I don't wanna die.

318
00:53:15.693 --> 00:53:17.569
You're not gonna
leave me here, are you?

319
00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:20.030
Are you, Ash?"

320
00:53:22.574 --> 00:53:25.536
Scotty, now come on!
Listen to me, for God's sake!

321
00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:28.414
Is there a way around the bridge?!

322
00:53:28.497 --> 00:53:31.250
There's a way-- the trail.

323
00:53:32.626 --> 00:53:36.588
But the trees, Ash... they know.

324
00:53:38.173 --> 00:53:40.092
Don't you see, Ash? They're alive.

325
00:53:52.604 --> 00:53:54.982
Shut up! Shut up, Linda!

326
00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:02.656
Shut up!

327
00:54:17.463 --> 00:54:20.716
Kill her. Kill her!

328
00:54:20.799 --> 00:54:24.094
Kill her if you can, lover boy!

329
00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:33.854
God forgive me, Linda.

330
00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:01.548
Oh, Ash... help me, please!

331
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:07.721
Ash?

332
00:55:08.806 --> 00:55:10.891
Help me, please, Ash.

333
00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:16.230
Oh, Ash, please don't let them
take me away again.

334
00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.314
- Please.
- No, I won't.

335
00:55:17.397 --> 00:55:20.317
- Please.
- I won't, I promise.

336
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.071
Ashley. Ashley, help me.

337
00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.405
Let me out of here.

338
00:55:26.406 --> 00:55:30.160
Ashley? Ash, help me.

339
00:55:30.244 --> 00:55:33.914
Let me out of here.
I'm-- I'm all right now.

340
00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.958
I'm all right now, Ashley.

341
00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:37.334
I'm all right.

342
00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:41.922
Unlock this chain and let me out.

343
00:55:49.638 --> 00:55:51.098
Cheryl?

344
00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:26.049
Cheryl?

345
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.183
I'm all right now, Ashley.

346
00:56:35.267 --> 00:56:37.394
Come unlock the chain and let me out!

347
00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:40.606
I'm all right now.

348
00:56:40.689 --> 00:56:42.107
It's your sister Cheryl.

349
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.117
Oh, you bastards!

350
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.119
Why are you torturing me like this?

351
00:56:54.202 --> 00:56:57.372
Why?!

352
00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:06.924
Shut up.

353
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.073
Useless. Useless.

354
00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:35.535
In time we'll come for him,
and then we'll come for you.

355
00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.271
Here. Here.

356
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.818
Now the sun will be up
in an hour or so,

357
00:58:07.901 --> 00:58:10.278
and we can all get out of here together--

358
00:58:10.362 --> 00:58:13.532
you, me, Linda, Shelly.

359
00:58:16.702 --> 00:58:19.579
No, not Shelly. She...

360
00:58:21.999 --> 00:58:24.918
We'll all be going home together.

361
00:58:25.002 --> 00:58:26.294
Wouldn't you like to be going home?

362
00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:29.881
I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?

363
00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:37.514
Scott?

364
00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:44.539
Join us. Join us.

365
01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:11.853
Oh, Linda.

366
01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:25.857
Come to me.

367
01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.167
Come on, get off.

368
01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:33.234
- Oh, God.
- Help, Ashley. Ashley!

369
01:08:34.485 --> 01:08:35.653
The door.

370
01:08:58.468 --> 01:08:59.719
The back door.

371
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:10.938
Shells-- where did I see
that box of shells?

372
01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:53.166
<i>We're gonna get you</i>

373
01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:56.544
- We're gonna get you.
- Shut up, Linda.

374
01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:59.714
- We're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

375
01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:01.340
- All of us!
- Shut up.

376
01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:05.052
- Ash, how <i>sweet</i> of you.
- God forgive me, Linda.

377
01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:07.805
<i>...through the act
of bodily dismemberment.</i>

378
01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.891
<i>- Hit her.
- I really love it.</i>

379
01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.726
<i>- Hit her.
- I'll never take it off.</i>

380
01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:13.102
<i>Hit it.</i>

381
01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:20.498
No!

382
01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:48.651
Oh, God...

383
01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:55.449
There it is!

384
01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.792
Come on, come on.
Why are you torturing me like this?

385
01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:20.558
It's nothing, man.

386
01:15:51.547 --> 01:15:53.049
Linda.

387
01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:14.779
Join us! Ashley, join us!

388
01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:18.235
Must die.

389
01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.164
No.

390
01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:26.215
No, no, no! Oh, God!

391
01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:44.191
<i>Join us.</i>

392
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.987
<i>Join us.</i>

393
01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:53.450
<i>Join us...</i>
