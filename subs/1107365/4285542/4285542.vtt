<<<<<<s>>>>>></s>

2
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.880
The forest in spring.

3
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.510
A time of renewal...

4
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.100
...of rebirth...

5
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.480
...of unbridled optimism...

6
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.440
...when new beginnings begin...

7
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.490
...and where the mighty mule deer...

8
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.610
...prepares for his upcoming
mating ritual.

9
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.950
One lucky doe will get to spend her life
with this fine specimen of a buck.

10
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.170
His magnificent antlers,
a testament to his great prowess...

11
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.420
...his strength, his masculinity,
his awesomeness!

12
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.630
His super-incredible coolness!

13
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.970
His amazing kick-butt-ocity!

14
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.800
- Ladies and gentlemen, here I...
- All right, Elliot.

15
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.930
Enough about your new rack
already, man.

16
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.560
Aye. Give it a rest,
you freak of nature.

17
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.060
- We grow tiresome of this talk of rack.
- It's true. We do.

18
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.650
- He's right, you know.
- Boring.

19
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.480
Like I never talk
about anything else.

20
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.240
Have you seen my new horns?
They're completely natural.

21
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.650
All me. Yes!

22
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.700
That tree is huge.

23
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.290
Like my antlers! Yeah!

24
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.200
Yes!

25
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.040
Oh, my rack is huge.

26
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.750
Yes!

27
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.750
Well, this time,
I have something big to say.

28
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.470
You know, not as big as my antlers.
I got you again, yes!

29
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.300
- Nailed it!
- Oh, come on.

30
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.140
- We got a ceremony to get to.
- Okay, okay, okay.

31
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.350
I'd just like to thank you...

32
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.140
...Boog, Mr. Weenie, Buddy,
Serge, Deni and McSquizzy...

33
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.020
...my closest, dearest friends,
for being here for me...

34
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.320
...on the most important day
of my life.

35
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.110
Yeah. You're welcome. Now, let's...

36
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.780
Unfortunately, the bachelor buck
stops here.

37
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.370
But I begin a new chapter
with Giselle...

38
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.200
...my doe, my deer, my female deer.

39
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.330
- That's a really nice thought...
- As my single life ends...

40
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.960
...finishes, expires, perishes...

41
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.880
...goes down in a blazing ball
of flames with no survivors...!

42
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.970
Elliot, relax.

43
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.050
- Now, let's get a move on, man.
- Yeah, we go to the wedding.

44
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.680
Wedding?

45
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.480
- Nuptials.
- Okay, just one minute.

46
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.440
- Let's get this over with.
- Hold on. Be right there.

47
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.940
Just polished these boys,
don't wanna scratch them.

48
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.280
Hurry, Elliot! Come on.

49
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.570
I'm falling.

50
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.070
- Careful!
- Oh, snap.

51
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.280
- Too late.
- Oh, that was smooth.

52
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.660
Elliot, don't look.

53
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.500
- Oh, he looked.
- He's going to blow.

54
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.170
Everybody, duck!

55
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.550
- Was that Elliot?
- I'm telling you...

56
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.970
...when you're in love, you hear
your man's voice everywhere.

57
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.180
- You know it, girl.
- You got that right.

58
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.980
Oh, Maria.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

59
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.940
- Thank you, Rosie.
- Our sweet Giselle's getting hitched.

60
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.950
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- Oh, it's okay.

61
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.570
- Elliot?
- Well, hello there, ladies.

62
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.950
- Oh, hi, Ian.
- Hello, Ian.

63
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.580
Just want to inform you
that the ceremony begins...

64
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.460
...at 0800 hours.
- Good to know.

65
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.380
If it all goes according to plan...
And it will.

66
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.170
- We'll finish up at 0900 hours...

67
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.420
...with a berry and dewdrop
reception brunch to follow.

68
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.630
- Great. Thanks, Ian.
- Not a problem.

69
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.850
Oh, and, Giselle,
there's still some time...

70
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.310
...if you'd rather be served some
beefcake instead of the pansy-loaf...

71
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.100
...if you know what I mean.

72
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.600
And I think you do.

73
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.230
I don't generally
go for venison, but...

74
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.520
...girl, that dish is fine.

75
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.480
- Don't you know it.
- Don't you know it.

76
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.690
No, thank you.

77
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.490
Elliot is all the man I'll ever need.

78
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.000
My rack. My beautiful rack.

79
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.330
Stop boo-hooing, you wee jessie.

80
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.000
- They'll grow back.
- Yeah, they're gonna grow back.

81
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.170
Just like the last time
you broke them' man.

82
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.670
And the time before that.

83
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.050
- And the time before that.
- What if it's a sign?

84
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.800
- A sign not to get...
- Get what?

85
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.680
- Married.

86
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.310
See this here? Now, this is sad.

87
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.680
- Poor Elliot.
- We need a diversion.

88
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.020
Hey, I know just the diversion...

89
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.690
...to take his mind off his antler.
We break his hoof with a large stone.

90
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.110
- Yeah, a large stone!
- A boulder.

91
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.780
I can't believe it. I mean, I can't...

92
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.820
I know what you're do...
Seriously, quit it...

93
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.530
- I can totally see what you're doing.
- Come on, Elliot.

94
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.620
If there's one thing
I am not in the mood for...

95
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.590
...it is a rabbit fight!
- Rabbit fight!

96
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.670
Gregalach!

97
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.630
You're going down, fat bear!

98
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.470
Stay!

99
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.850
Sit.

100
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.680
Now, count to 10.

101
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.770
What are you doing?
He's getting away.

102
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.440
Boog gave me a command
to count to 10, so I...

103
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.860
I can't believe I fell for that.

104
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.740
I must never be weak again.

105
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.910
You don't know what it was like
living with the humans.

106
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.740
If they say "sit", you sit.
If they say "fetch", you fetch.

107
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.410
You must stay alert,
or they will steal our freedom...

108
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.170
...and lock us up forever und ever.
- Forever und ever?

109
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.420
But you broke free.
How did you do it?

110
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.630
- What's the secret?
- Never forget who you are in here.

111
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.880
A vulnerable child...

112
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.840
...who just wants to be loved?
- No!

113
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.600
A wild animal who relies
on no one but himself.

114
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.680
- Now, say it with me. I'm wild!
- I'm wild.

115
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.980
- With conviction. I'm wild!
- I'm wild!

116
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.780
Now, let's go find the fat bear.

117
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.490
I can't believe it, Bob.

118
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.740
It's been a whole year
since we saw Mr. Weenie.

119
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.160
I know he's still out there.
I can feel it.

120
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.830
Can you feel it, Bob?

121
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.130
- Well, I...
- Mr. Weenie! Mr. Weenie!

122
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.880
Do you think he'll find
our biscuit trail, Bob?

123
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.960
Do you think he'll
come back to us, Bob?

124
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.800
Do you think Mr. Weenie's
safe out there, Bob?

125
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.720
Boog will never find me.

126
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.430
Now, where is that Weenie?

127
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.480
Guten tag, fat bear!

128
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.060
I am victorious!

129
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.610
Show-off. I'm gonna
have to check the rule book.

130
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.860
Mortal combat!

131
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.960
He got me! Great shot, Elliot.
You won, man.

132
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.290
Nobody ever expects...

133
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.000
...the falling-down-the-tree-in-pain
manoeuvre.

134
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.170
- Very clever, mule deer.
- He cracks me up.

135
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.880
- He surprised you good on that one.
- Oh, is that right?

136
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.300
- It's true.
- Game over.

137
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.720
All right, now, let's get cleaned up.

138
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.390
- Time for Elliot to tie the knot.
- Already? No!

139
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.470
This was the best stag party ever...

140
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.270
...which has to keep going.
Please, rabbits to throw.

141
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.940
Oh, grow up, you big baby.

142
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.400
- Let's get moving.
- Boog...

143
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.690
...do you think I'm doing
the right thing here?

144
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.980
Marrying Giselle?

145
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.530
What I'm wondering is,
is Giselle doing the right thing?

146
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.660
I'm just kidding you.

147
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.030
Now, will you relax?

148
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.790
We're gathered today
for a very serious occasion.

149
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.540
Elliot? What happened?

150
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.210
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing.

151
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.050
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

152
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.840
I couldn't be better.
Just had a little trim off the top.

153
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.390
Giselle and Elliot...

154
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.810
...have courted and made the decision
to join together forever...

155
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.020
...and ever.

156
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560
Is he okay?

157
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.480
Forever and ever?

158
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.480
Still time to change your mind.

159
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.900
- What?
- Wait, I knew about forever.

160
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.030
Guys, but what's this
about "and ever"?

161
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.780
- Be cool.
- Nobody said anything...

162
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:49.740
...about an additional "and ever".

163
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.080
No! The food of oppression.

164
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.880
I must be strong.

165
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.420
Oh, maybe just a taste.

166
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.310
I'd like to ask the buck
to step forward...

167
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.100
...for a ceremonial displaying
of the antlers...

168
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.060
Antler.

169
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.770
- To show his commitment
to his doe.

170
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.360
- Seriously. Still time.
- Not gonna happen.

171
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.530
Oh, so good.

172
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.240
I'm weak! How could I?

173
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.330
- Do you, Giselle, take Smelliot...
- Ian.

174
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.120
- To be your lifelong mate?

175
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.460
I do.

176
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.590
And do you, Elliot...

177
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.100
...take Giselle to be
your lifelong mate?

178
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.350
That's you. Your line.

179
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.770
You go now.

180
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.940
Elliot. Go on, man.

181
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.020
- That's your cue. Go, go.
- Don't be shy.

182
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.650
Come on. Say it, you ninny.

183
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.070
Elliot, are you okay?

184
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.320
Come on, step it up.
I got a buck mitzvah at 3.

185
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.160
- Weenie! Weenie!
- Weenie?

186
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.000
- What, are you speaking French?
- Weenie! Oh, no!

187
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.830
Elliot? Where are you going?

188
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.670
Weenie, come back!

189
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.170
- Stop. Weenie!
- I must be strong.

190
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.340
- Weenie! Weenie!
- So good.

191
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.010
Weenie, over here! Weenie!
Here, boy!

192
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.890
Weenie!

193
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.680
Oh, no. Full moon.

194
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.310
Is that you? Mr. Weenie!

195
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.980
It's you! It's you!
I can't believe it's you!

196
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.190
It's a miracle.

197
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.190
He's been captured!

198
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.030
- What am I gonna do?
- Bob, it worked!

199
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.860
Oh, no, this is terrible.

200
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.450
Everything is okay.

201
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.700
Mommy is here.

202
00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.660
He's being tortured!

203
00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.870
No!

204
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.870
- No!
- No!

205
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.670
No!

206
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.050
- What are you doing?
- What's this all about?

207
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.800
- You better have a good explanation.
- Yes! Yes, I do.

208
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.560
- Oh, I can't wait to hear this excuse.
- It was horrible.

209
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.100
Weenie was minding his own
business when she appeared.

210
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.810
He screamed,
but she ignored his cry.

211
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.900
And then she grabbed him
with her claws.

212
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.360
Oh, my goodness.

213
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.740
Then she tried to squeeze
the life out of him.

214
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.660
- That's horrible.
- Sad story.

215
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.070
But he fought back.

216
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.950
Oh, she tortured him.

217
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.330
Slapped him.

218
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.750
Poked his eyes out, like this.

219
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.540
It was horrible!

220
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.880
It was the worst thing I've ever seen!

221
00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.420
Oh, the humanity!

222
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.590
Elliot, are you maybe putting
a little bit too much on that?

223
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.720
Listen, Boog, I'm telling the story.

224
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.560
And finally, the hairless blob
dragged him off...

225
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.770
...into her chariot of horror!

226
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.270
Wait, wait, wait.
So, what you're saying is...

227
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.770
- Mr. Weenie's been kidnapped!
- No.

228
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.280
- For real?
- Yes, it's true.

229
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.690
- Tough break. I miss him already.
- What now?

230
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.070
Well, we could finish the ceremony.
Come on.

231
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.950
I worked hard on those centrepieces.

232
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.530
As much as Elliot and I
wanna finish the ceremony...

233
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.450
...we need to go after Mr. Weenie.
- Giselle's right!

234
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.960
And until he's back in the safety
of our friends and family...

235
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.880
...in the warm caress
of our bosoms...

236
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.710
...there will be,
there can be, no celebration.

237
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.880
So, what can we do? Probably
halfway to the valley's end by now.

238
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.340
So? We can't give up.

239
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.310
We didn't give up on the hunters
when they raided the forest.

240
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.310
We can't give up on our friend
Weenie.

241
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.480
The Boogster's right.
Who's with me?

242
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.140
Oh, yeah. Count me in.

243
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.940
- Me too.
- Okay. Good. Who else is in?

244
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.150
I'm beeling at them bajins.
So let's quit bumping the gums...

245
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.610
...and give them a right chibbing!

246
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.450
I'm not sure what Squiz just said,
but I'll take that as a yes.

247
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.830
- Yes! It's a yes!
- I'm in too.

248
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.160
- Me too.
- I'm with you, buddy.

249
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.040
Sorry, I got the wife and kids.

250
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.500
You turn your back on the pelts
for one second...

251
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.920
...all heck breaks loose. I'm out.
- Oh, leave it to the beaver.

252
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.970
In your dreams.
I just had my nails done, girl.

253
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.680
Sounds fun, but I gotta stay
back and protect the herd.

254
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:23.770
You're all a bunch of meek-minded,
yellow-bellied, pansy-a...

255
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.480
As McSquizzy is trying to say...

256
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.150
...a smaller group
is probably better anyway.

257
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.320
- We can move faster.
- Let's get a move on.

258
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.360
Move out, boys.

259
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.360
- Elliot?
- Yeah?

260
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.780
You're going the wrong way,
you big daftie!

261
00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.540
I know that. Fall in.

262
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.880
Oh, Mr. Weenie, we've been
looking for you for so long.

263
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:58.180
It must've been horrible
out there all alone in the wild.

264
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.550
Oh, no one's gonna believe it!

265
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.260
Should I call the caravan, Bob?

266
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.220
Breaker, breaker, Fox Jaws.

267
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.060
- This is Mudflaps and Wild Man.
- Copy that. Over.

268
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.400
You'll never guess.

269
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.940
We found Mr. Weenie! It's true!

270
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.820
Say hello, Mr. Weenie.

271
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.700
- Did you hear that?
- Congrats, Mudflaps. Good to hear!

272
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.910
What's that, Bob? Oh, Wild Man says
we need to make a pit stop for a fill-up.

273
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.040
We'll see you
over at the campground.

274
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.330
- Over.
- Breaker, breaker, happy travellers.

275
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.710
Put your ears on,
I've got great news!

276
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.590
Mudflaps and Wild Man found
their long-lost weenie dog! Over.

277
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.100
Oh, man, is this good.

278
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.430
Hey, Fifi, you want some?

279
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.600
You know, Roberto,
those doggy treats...

280
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.070
...are filled with carbohydrates.

281
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.690
And if I could pronounce that word,
that would mean what?

282
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.280
It would mean you should
stick to the lean proteins...

283
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.070
...the meats, the poultries.

284
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.790
How are you gonna look
sitting by the pool?

285
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.750
- I don't know. Hot and really happy.
- That was rhetorical, moron.

286
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.960
Put down the treats.
You've eaten enough.

287
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.800
I'm going to pretend
I didn't see that.

288
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.350
- Hey, Fifi?
- Yes?

289
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.520
How long do you think it'll be
till we stop?

290
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.730
Because I gotta poop.

291
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.160
Seriously, I gotta poop really bad.

292
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.120
I said it was going to be a long ride,
but you never listen.

293
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.500
Just like you didn't listen when
I told you not to eat the entire burrito.

294
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.340
Now, you know what this
means I have to do.

295
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.250
Gosh, darn.

296
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.010
Every time we leave the house,
you put me through this...

297
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.340
Fifi! Fifi, stop!

298
00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.180
- Do you hear me?
- Come on. Help a brother out.

299
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.680
What on earth has gotten
into that dog?

300
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.940
You know I hate doing this.

301
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.360
Yeah, but you do it so well.
Can you hurry it along?

302
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.690
Oh, there you are baby, Fifi.

303
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.900
One pit stop, coming up.

304
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.070
Oh, gross.

305
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.910
No, Fifi. No.

306
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.910
Breaker, breaker. This is Fox Jaws.

307
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.880
One of my little yappers just
served up a can of gut soup...

308
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.500
...and we are talking chunky.
Let's pull off. Over.

309
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.510
Come on, you dumb cat.
Get off the road.

310
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.550
You two run along
while I get cleaned up.

311
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.850
Out of my way. Out of my way.
I don't wanna be rude, but I gotta go.

312
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.270
- Stanley, old buddy.
- Oh, here we go.

313
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.850
Stanley, it's been ages.

314
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.230
Actually, it's been exactly
one year, Roger.

315
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.570
Really? It seems like
such a long time.

316
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.240
Oh, I have to explain this again?

317
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.950
Okay, listen, we go to Pet Paradiso
every year at the same time.

318
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.290
And, painfully,
we have this same conversation.

319
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.420
- We do?
- Yes. Yes, we do.

320
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.170
Is this ringing a bell?

321
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.420
Stanley, it's been ages.

322
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.760
It's gonna be a long week.

323
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.510
Oh, Rufus. There you are.
How's my shining star?

324
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.390
Why, Charlene, look at you.

325
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.430
Don't you look prettier than a glob
of butter on a stack of wheat cakes.

326
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.850
Oh, goodness me.

327
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.780
- Thank you, Rufus. Oh, may I?
- Well, I'd be much obliged.

328
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.690
Hey, Fifi.
Did you hear they found Mr. Weenie?

329
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.570
- Isn't that great?
- Really?

330
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.030
- Are you sure?
- I heard he lived with wild animals.

331
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.200
No. That's horrible.

332
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.870
- He's lucky they didn't hurt him.
- Or kill him.

333
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.960
Or worse.

334
00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.380
I was once in the vicious clutches
of wild animals.

335
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.000
- You were?
- I was.

336
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.880
What was it like?

337
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:09.640
It's too painful for me to talk about.

338
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.390
Gather round.

339
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.470
Okay, Fifi.
You want the squeaky toy?

340
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.220
There I was.

341
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.770
- All alone.
- You want it?

342
00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.600
Alone in that steaming jungle.

343
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.940
That unforgivable heart of darkness,
where you can't see your own paws.

344
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.700
And the only sound is the frantic,
but adorable...

345
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.160
...pitter-patter of your own heart.

346
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.370
When suddenly...

347
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.330
They were everywhere.

348
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.090
There was no escape.

349
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.340
My life flashed before my eyes,
and then the unspeakable.

350
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.890
- What happened? Did you live?
- What happened?

351
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.560
I'll show you what happened.

352
00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.100
Let this be a lesson to you all.

353
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.360
- How ghastly.
- It's so pink.

354
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.650
- That is one sad tail.
- I want a girlfriend.

355
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.440
Don't interrupt now. Please?

356
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.360
I lost two things on that day:
My innocence...

357
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.870
...and my squeaky toy.

358
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.790
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

359
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.880
Speak of the devil.

360
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.050
- Disgusting.
- Oh, no.

361
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.130
Not the fuzzy little bunny.

362
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.010
Don't you understand?
We must remain vigilant.

363
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.140
Even one wild animal among us...

364
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.680
...can send us back to those dark days
of anarchy.

365
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.850
Come on, but he's so cute.

366
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.310
Pay attention.

367
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.730
Even one little fuzzy bunny
can infest us all.

368
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.070
Like the fleas on Roberto's back,
they must all be eradicated.

369
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.070
I'm gonna tear you apart.

370
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.250
Fifi! Heel!

371
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.090
One day, you vile little beast.

372
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.050
One day, I will personally
teach you a lesson...

373
00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.090
...you will never forget!

374
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.930
I'm coming, Mother.

375
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.270
Hey, does anybody
know where we are?

376
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.600
Didn't think so.

377
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.690
- Isn't this great, Boog?
- What's great?

378
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.230
You know, not great that Weenie's
been kidnapped...

379
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.900
...but great that we're living life
on the edge.

380
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.530
It's just like old times.

381
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.110
- Two guys, out on the road.
- Hey, guys.

382
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.530
- Room for one more?
- For sure.

383
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.780
So, Elliot...

384
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.450
...now that we have
a moment alone...

385
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.380
Hey, what's that?

386
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.250
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened...

387
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.880
...at the ceremony this morning.

388
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.470
- What do you mean?
- Well, while I was saying, "I do"...

389
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.050
...you were looking like you didn't.
- What?

390
00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.850
Giselle, don't be ridiculous.

391
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.430
Look, Elliot,
I know something is bothering you.

392
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.520
Ever since the ceremony,
you've been acting a little strange.

393
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.310
We're partners.
You can tell me anything.

394
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.150
All right, Giselle,
but remember, you asked.

395
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.650
Basically, I'm worried about
"forever and ever".

396
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.070
"Forever and ever"?

397
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.740
About Mr. Weenie
being lost forever and ever.

398
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.620
So this has nothing to do with me...

399
00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.000
...you're only worried
about Mr. Weenie...

400
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.710
...right?
- Yes, I am.

401
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.840
But I'm mostly worried about
you and me, our special day...

402
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.760
...and getting back to the ceremony.

403
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.680
But finding Mr. Weenie
could take a long, long time.

404
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:41.010
Could take months, really.
I mean, years, perhaps.

405
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.520
- A lifetime.
- Found him.

406
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.930
There he is.

407
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.850
- He's over there.
- She found him.

408
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.100
- Oh, way to go, Giselle.
- Giselle.

409
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.020
What luck, huh, Elliot?

410
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.690
We'll be back home
and married in no time.

411
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.150
Well, I mean,
that could be another RV, you know.

412
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.570
- There's Weenie in the window.
- He's waving at us.

413
00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.200
- Here I am!
- Hi, Weenie.

414
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.370
- He's... That's a totally different dog.
- Nope. That's him.

415
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.750
We better keep looking.

416
00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.370
Come back. You know we gotta
go get him out of there.

417
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.960
- Help! Help!
- No, I know that. I just...

418
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.170
What was the question?

419
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.550
- All right, here's the plan.
- That's all wrong.

420
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.050
Squizmeister, you and Buddy
will be the entry team.

421
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.720
- Roger.
- Serge, Deni.

422
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.140
Smash and grab.
Boog, you're with me.

423
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.640
Let's limit the casualties.

424
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.760
- All right.
- What about me? What can I do?

425
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:28.810
Well, yeah, that's right. What...
You stay there and guard the trees.

426
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.150
- Really? That's the best you could do?
- No, Elliot. Wait.

427
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.520
Hi there, folks.

428
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:38.900
I'd like to offer a complimentary
32-point diagnostic inspection...

429
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.410
...while I fill up your tank.

430
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.070
- Restroom, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

431
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.740
- In the back.
- Thank you.

432
00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.080
And may I suggest you trying
our famous pecan roll?

433
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.580
I make them myself. They're inside.

434
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.120
For a buck.

435
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.500
Two for $2.

436
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.460
Off the road!

437
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.390
Engine knock. Yep.
I'd know it anywhere.

438
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:09.890
Come on. Let's go. Quiet.

439
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.270
It's about time you got here, Boog.
Keep up.

440
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.940
- Deni and I are ready.
- Me too.

441
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.980
Oh, thank goodness.
You've come for me.

442
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.190
No need to worry.

443
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.610
Okay, we need a grappling hook,
a 30-foot rope...

444
00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.120
...winch, pulley, truck with an open
engine block and a can of sardines.

445
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.200
Why don't we just
open the door, genius?

446
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.120
- I'm trying to think outside the box.
- Okay, single file.

447
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.120
- Stay quiet.
- Don't tell me to be quiet.

448
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.380
Tell the ducks to be quiet.

449
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.760
Weenie, it's all clear.
Come on. Let's go.

450
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.510
- Yeah, coming through.
- We need a new plan.

451
00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.140
Everybody, quiet.
I need a minute to think.

452
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:47.760
- Time's up.
- I got it.

453
00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.140
Plush.

454
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.610
Face it, Earl.
These folks are living your dream.

455
00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.570
- That was close. I think we're clear.
- That's not part of the plan, Boog.

456
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.990
- From now on...
- Hey, fatso, shove off.

457
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.660
You're snapping my spine here.

458
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.200
Oh, suspension is shot.
Definitely shot.

459
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.660
Or it could be the bushings.

460
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.080
Bob, which one should I get
for our Mr. Weenie-Baby?

461
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.050
Stripes or plaid?
You're absolutely right.

462
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.840
- Please don't leave me.
- Mr. E's got you covered.

463
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.930
- Stand back.
- No.

464
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.260
Let me take a look-see.

465
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.850
Now, that is a sturdy piece
of hardware, right, guys?

466
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.690
- I'm doomed.
- Doomed, huh? Yeah.

467
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.360
Stay with me, boys. I got it.

468
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.030
Now I have to top off the fluids.

469
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.530
All right, go.

470
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.490
Come on with it.

471
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.660
Most likely the rear differential.

472
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.870
I was right.

473
00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.880
Bob, should we get a pecan roll
for the ride?

474
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.420
- Elliot, you okay?
- Hey.

475
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.930
I'm getting sick and tired
of breaking your fall.

476
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.130
Get off me!

477
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.300
- Oh, yolk.
- It's okay, Elliot. I'm here.

478
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.560
Oh, these cheese doodles
are so good.

479
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.430
They really taste like cheese.

480
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.560
Snack time over? Come on.
We need to focus.

481
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.940
- Yeah. Focus on the Weenie.
- Come on, everybody.

482
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.480
- What he said.
- Quiet. New plan.

483
00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.200
We need to lubricate the collar.

484
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.910
Good idea.

485
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.660
No, no. Something else, please.

486
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.910
Oh, Bob, do you think
Mr. Weenie will like it?

487
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.750
Hey, how about that pecan roll, huh?
Did I tell you?

488
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.750
Hey, could you be a sport
and grab that ladder?

489
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.960
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

490
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.750
- There's some more.
- Stop! Enough!

491
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.010
I'm not gonna lie.

492
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.010
It was a little scary up there.

493
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.890
My spine! You're killing me.

494
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.600
- That'll be $437.
- Incoming.

495
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.390
- Or I'll trade you.
- Double-time.

496
00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.610
- Gas for that bearskin rug.
- I'm out of room.

497
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.480
- I'm out of air.
- Swing wide.

498
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:03.690
- Easy.
- Follow my lead.

499
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.110
- Come on now.
- Pull.

500
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.450
- Use your legs.
- Pull.

501
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.120
Oh, my gosh.
Did you see that, Bob?

502
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.290
The Weenie is free.

503
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:17.370
Let's make a break for it, boys.

504
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.960
Deni, follow me.

505
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.670
- Gregalach!
- Run like the wind.

506
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.420
Wait for me. I have teeny legs.

507
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.130
- I'm out. I'm stuck.
- I did it.

508
00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.850
Take cover!

509
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.640
Elliot, you fool.

510
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.480
- Shake a leg, Weenie.
- What's going on in there?

511
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.270
Mr. Weenie, are you okay?

512
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.520
We did it. We're all safe, right?

513
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.980
Okay, roll call.

514
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.490
- Boog? McSquizzy? Deni? Serge?
- Here.

515
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:47.650
- Weenie?
- There.

516
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.860
- Where?
- Bye, now.

517
00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.160
Oh, no.

518
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.780
Well, where's Buddy? Buddy?
Sound off, Buddy.

519
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.830
Here.

520
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.500
Well, you've screwed up again,
you one-horn dumpling.

521
00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.170
- How did that happen?
- Oh, Elliot.

522
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.370
Imbecile.

523
00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.580
What do we do now?

524
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.340
- We are missing two.
- Idiot.

525
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.720
Blaming Elliot for blowing the escape
isn't gonna help us find Mr. Weenie.

526
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.180
- No, but it's fun.
- Hey, what?

527
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:13.970
- Giselle's onto something.
- She is?

528
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.470
We need to find out
where that RV is going.

529
00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.230
I know. Serge, Deni, you guys fly off
and locate the RV from the sky.

530
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.060
In the meantime, we'll stay
on their trail by foot.

531
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.400
Everybody got it?

532
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.650
- Smart girl.
- Oh, yeah.

533
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.530
You call aerial surveillance
a good idea?

534
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.490
- All right, General Giselle.
- What's with you?

535
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.870
We're not even married yet, and
you're already telling me what to do.

536
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.620
You need a little space?
All right, yeah. No problem.

537
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:45.420
- I'm just trying to save Mr. Weenie.
- And there lies the problem.

538
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.880
There's only room for one cook
in this kitchen...

539
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:52.010
...and that one cook is me and Boog.
We're partners.

540
00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.050
- Oh, I get it.
- Finally.

541
00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:00.060
- This was starting to get awkward.
- Awkward? You call this awkward?

542
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.560
What do you call running off in
the middle of our wedding ceremony?

543
00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.570
- I was trying to save Mr. Weenie.
- Oh, we're back to that excuse.

544
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.400
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now.
Simmer down, y'all.

545
00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.030
That's it. I'm going home.

546
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.490
No one's going home.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

547
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.530
I think you should go home, Giselle.

548
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.790
- You're just slowing us down.
- Whatever.

549
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.910
No, she's not. You are.

550
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.370
Boog?

551
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.960
Look, man, we need Giselle.
She's a great tracker.

552
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.630
Yeah, and without her,
we'd never have found Weenie...

553
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.050
...and that giant tin-can thing.

554
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.760
- Beginner's luck.
- Come on, Giselle.

555
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.560
We gotta stick together out here.

556
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.270
We're partners, right?

557
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:47.610
Boog. You traitor.
And you, traitor-ette.

558
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.770
Enjoy your newfound partnership.

559
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.440
- Oh, come on, Elliot. Look...
- I don't need any of you.

560
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.110
I'll find Mr. Weenie on my own.
Solo.

561
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.830
Hey, you're going
the wrong way, you choob.

562
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.200
Oh, thank you very much.
It's a shortcu...

563
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:09.500
I'm okay, everybody.

564
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.380
- You don't care.
- Not really.

565
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.050
Was that too harsh?

566
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.810
- We must follow the road, eh?
- You think?

567
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.820
Come on.
Let's cut through the forest.

568
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.820
Weenie, I am coming for you,
buddy.

569
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.780
I am a wonderful tracker.

570
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.740
I think Boog can fly
faster than you, huh?

571
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.790
A million laughs.

572
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.500
So are we having fun yet?

573
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.340
Weenie is right around here,
and I am gonna...

574
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.470
Wiener tracks! Yes, vindication!

575
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.680
I've got your track, I've got your scent,
and here I come.

576
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.470
That's a road, not a landing strip.

577
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.810
Pull up.

578
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.680
Hurry. Watch the ribs.

579
00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.860
Well, it's official.
Weenie is not up here.

580
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.070
A whole herd of wieners.

581
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.320
Oh, but these are Weenie's tracks
right here.

582
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.160
He's an alpha wiener.

583
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.790
Wonder why my jaw hurts.
Oh, well. More tracks.

584
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.130
Oh, we're here.

585
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.710
Hey, good to see you there, Bob.
There's a spot open on the right.

586
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.220
Aren't you excited, Mr. Weenie?

587
00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.810
You get to see
all of your old friends again.

588
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.180
And don't worry, snookums.

589
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.480
Mama will make sure
that nothing bad happens...

590
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.690
...to her little snuggly-wuggly
ever again.

591
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.230
Bob, do you have
the Invisible Pet Fortress...

592
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.360
...Electric Shock Collar?

593
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.400
That's the one.

594
00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.030
Oh, that was nice. Thank you.

595
00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.500
What's the matter, Bob?
It's not working?

596
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.120
Oh, good, it does work.

597
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:15.300
Don't worry, Mr. Weenie,
it's more comfortable than it looks.

598
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.420
Now, remember,
stay inside the Invisible Pet Fortress.

599
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.760
Rufus, darling, is that Mr. Weenie?

600
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.350
Well, butter my behind
and call me a biscuit.

601
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.850
Let's go smell him.

602
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.600
Now you'll be safe,
my little love muffin.

603
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.140
Have fun with your friends.

604
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.060
Mommy and Bob are gonna go have
some grown-up time with the adults.

605
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.610
Hey, I found Weenie.

606
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.360
- Oh, Mr. Weenie.
- Well, hey, short and long.

607
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.820
- How you been?
- My friends.

608
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.990
- It's Mr. Weenie.
- How you doing, Mr. Weenie?

609
00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.120
Deni. Look, there's Mr. Weenie.

610
00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.870
Weenie.

611
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.460
We must return to base
for reinforcements, huh?

612
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.620
Good plan.

613
00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.790
How you doing, Mr. Weenie?
Good to see you.

614
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.500
Oh, I've missed you all so much.

615
00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.300
It's been so long
since I've had a proper greeting.

616
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.590
- It's Weenie, all right.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

617
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.680
- Give me a hug.
- Stop.

618
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.470
Don't crowd him.

619
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.100
This dog has just been through
the unthinkable.

620
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.640
- The what?
- Don't even think it.

621
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:13.480
Why? You don't have to be rude.

622
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.270
Poor Weenie. Poor, poor Weenie.

623
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.400
Who knows
the horrors you've seen?

624
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:20.990
- What horrors?
- Don't worry.

625
00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.490
- We will get through it together.
- Actually, it wasn't that bad.

626
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.870
I know. It was worse.

627
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.370
- I've been through it too.
- Really?

628
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.660
Oh, Fifi.

629
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:35.250
Will he ever be the old Mr. Weenie
we knew and loved?

630
00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.420
- We can only hope.
- But I am the same.

631
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.210
We'll have to see
how much damage...

632
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.420
...those insidious wilds
have done to him.

633
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.510
"Insidious wilds"?
Nein, the wild animals are my friends.

634
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.430
Friends?

635
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.680
Your friends? Your friends?

636
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.890
It is worse
than I could have ever imagined.

637
00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.350
Your friends? It's worse
than I could have ever imagined.

638
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.360
He's gone... feral.

639
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.150
- Feral?
- What's that mean?

640
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.530
Fifi, what shall we do?

641
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.320
You heard the lassie.
What do we do?

642
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.320
- Can he be helped?
- Yes.

643
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.200
But it won't be pretty.

644
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.120
Prepare... the tent.

645
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.620
- The tent?
- Not the tent.

646
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.290
Oh, yes.

647
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.500
The tent.

648
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:25.590
I'm so tired.

649
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.320
Hey, hey, hey, check it out.
They're back.

650
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:43.650
Well, it's about time.

651
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.150
Down below. Friends.

652
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.910
- Our friends.
- We're low on fuel.

653
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.410
Dive.

654
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.700
Look, man, here they come.

655
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.830
- Serge, are you okay?
- Did you find Mr. Weenie?

656
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.580
- Relax. Deep breaths.
- Where is he?

657
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.580
Come on, breathe for me.
In and out.

658
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.420
What did you find?

659
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.340
- Where's Weenie?
- What she says. Where's Weenie?

660
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.930
- Where is he?
- What is he doing?

661
00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.350
How many syllables? Sounds like...

662
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.390
I think I got it. He's in a tree.

663
00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.560
- He's in a tree house. A birdhouse.
- Woods.

664
00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.600
- His eggs are hatching.
- He has bird flu.

665
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.480
- He's underwater.
- In a lagoon.

666
00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.770
- He works in a shrimp boat.
- He's in the ocean.

667
00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.780
- In a sub.
- He's wearing a wet suit.

668
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.490
- This is it. At a zoo.
- In a cage.

669
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:29.110
- He's joined a travelling circus.
- He was eaten by a lion in a cage.

670
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.950
He's a clown. No, no, no.
It's a freak show.

671
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.250
Hello? We found Mr. Weenie.

672
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.960
Like Deni was saying...

673
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.540
...Mr. Weenie is over the trees,
past the lake and the mountain...

674
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.920
...at the campsite with some dogs.
And two cats.

675
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.130
All right. Let's go.

676
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.300
- Let's do this. Tell me something...
- No, stop!

677
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.470
Oh, I'm peched.

678
00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.350
Past the mountains, huh?
Here's an idea.

679
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.810
What do you say
we all rest for the night, huh?

680
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:04.650
Brilliant.

681
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.900
Come on, Weenie. Just do it.

682
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.950
You know you want to.
It's inside you.

683
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.490
Just do it, boy.

684
00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.410
- Do it for pets everywhere, Weenie.
- Never!

685
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.120
- Just do it.
- Better do what the basset says.

686
00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.580
Hurry up, before Fifi gets here.
Too late.

687
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.380
Is it done yet? Did he do it?
Is it over? Is it done?

688
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.550
Did we do this? Is it over?
Are we finished?

689
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.210
- Roberto.
- Fifi, it was great.

690
00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.470
You missed it. Too bad. Let's go.

691
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.970
- The real answer, Rufus?
- We tried everything.

692
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.010
Boy's locked up like a rusty gate.

693
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:42.100
Oh, Weenie,
you can make this stop at any time.

694
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.230
All you have to do is...

695
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.900
...roll over.

696
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.110
Roll over.

697
00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.360
- He keeps saying that.
- All right, then.

698
00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.700
We're going to have to
turn this up a notch.

699
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.450
- I don't really see the point.
- Rufus, get the instruments.

700
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.630
Here you are.

701
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.840
Oh, no.

702
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.300
Roberto, hand me the stick.

703
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.170
Oh, boy.

704
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:17.390
Listen carefully. Do as I say.

705
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.810
Please, no.

706
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:20.980
Fetch.

707
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.390
- Go on, Weenie, fetch.
- Come on, Weenie.

708
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.400
- Come on, Weenie. Now, come on.
- Get the stick. Go on, go on.

709
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:27.690
Come on, Weenie.

710
00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.690
- You're almost there. You can do it.
- Go, Weenie, fetch.

711
00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.490
I'm a wild. I'm a wild animal.

712
00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.410
- And again with the nein.
- You are trying my patience.

713
00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:40.330
You are no longer a wild animal.

714
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.080
You are a domestic pet...

715
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:48.500
...and domestic pets
must obey their master.

716
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:52.420
Now, hand me the squeaky toy.

717
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:53.760
- No.
- Yes!

718
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.470
- Okay, I hear you. Calm down. Relax.
- Yes, yes.

719
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.760
Squeak, squeak.

720
00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.180
- It's a wild!
- He's so blue.

721
00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.430
Not the Sunday edition.

722
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:04.520
Quick, Buddy, hop on.

723
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.020
- He's getting away.
- Please, Fifi, no running.

724
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:12.530
Buddy, get the electric collar off.
I'll stall them. Hurry!

725
00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.660
- Help us out, Charlene!
- Oh, I can't. I got my rollers in.

726
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.780
- Weenie, you're so fast.
- Careful, Roger. You could...

727
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.790
- Too late.
- Go, Weenie, go!

728
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.120
Want another Shirley Temple there,
wild man?

729
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.880
Oh, my, what's that?
Is that Mr. Weenie?

730
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.460
Spread out.

731
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800
I'm gonna take five.

732
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.630
Cut them off.

733
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.310
- Buddy, hurry.
- I'm trying.

734
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.980
Oh, no.

735
00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.530
- We did it.
- Now get this sweater off.

736
00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.530
It itches.

737
00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:00.120
- That's nasty.
- I have had it.

738
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.120
No more. The wild animals
have pushed me too far!

739
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.330
The next wild I see
crawl out of that forest...

740
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:12.500
...if they don't have their papers,
they are getting a full Fifi smackdown!

741
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.550
This is war!

742
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.180
Oh, Fifi.

743
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.180
I really don't have the stomach
for this.

744
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.680
He smells like bad barbecue.

745
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.680
Mr. Weenie, are you all right?

746
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.350
Mr. Weenie, where are you?

747
00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.980
He's gone, Bob. Oh, no.

748
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.980
We just found him,
and now he's gone again.

749
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.200
Weenie. My poor Weenie.

750
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.950
I wanna go home, Bob.
Please take me home.

751
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.960
Now, I've heard some folks say...

752
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:54.840
...the squirrel child
still roams these parts.

753
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.010
And some nights,
when the moon is full...

754
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.010
...and his monstrous buck teeth
ache to nibble...

755
00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:08.230
...you might, if you're unlucky,
hear his bloodcurdling cry!

756
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:14.480
- Run!
- Let's move!

757
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.280
Sorry. All that food.

758
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.620
It's making me...

759
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.080
- Making me hungry.
- Is he kidding?

760
00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.250
I'm so exhausted,
I couldn't eat a wee morsel.

761
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.760
That hits the spot.

762
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.430
Great. Even my roasting stick
is weak and pathetic.

763
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.230
Hey. Don't that look
just like my man, Elli...?

764
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.900
What was with Elliot
this morning anyway?

765
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.400
Oh, hey. I wonder what's in here.

766
00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.940
Yes. Check this out.

767
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.240
This is a little something
Beth taught me.

768
00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.620
These are called s'mores.

769
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:13.120
Try some.
They take your mind off of everything.

770
00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.290
Clear your head. You ain't gonna
have nothing on your mind.

771
00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.590
I hope it works.

772
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.260
You know what?
I'm glad Elliot's out of my life.

773
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.510
Come on. I know you guys
exchanged some words back there...

774
00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.310
...but you're meant for each other.

775
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.810
- He's crazy about you.
- Really?

776
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.440
I bet Elliot's never once mentioned
that he loves me.

777
00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.520
Has he?

778
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.150
Come on, we're guys.
We talk about guy stuff.

779
00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.820
You know, like sports.

780
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:45.950
Rabbit bowling, rabbit tennis,
hockey with rabbits.

781
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.200
- I'll take that as a no.
- All right.

782
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.750
Take this marshmallow, for example.
It's great all by itself.

783
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.330
It's soft, fluffy and sweet.
Like you, Giselle.

784
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.590
Oh, Boog,
you're embarrassing yourself.

785
00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.000
Stay with me.
Now, check out this chocolate bar.

786
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.210
It's awesome too.

787
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.010
It's full of caffeine and sugar,
and it make you spazz out.

788
00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.220
Like Elliot.

789
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.800
And even though on their own,
both are great...

790
00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.100
...neither are perfect, in my opinion.

791
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.770
But they are perfect together.

792
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.190
Come on. Give it a try.

793
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.400
That's it. There you go.

794
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.900
You're right, Boog.

795
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.530
- This is really good.
- That's what I'm talking about.

796
00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.200
Unfortunately, some chocolate bars
feel that being in a s'more...

797
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:32.870
...is too much commitment
and would rather run free...

798
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.040
...instead of settling
for some marshmallow.

799
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.830
- You're missing the point.
- Now that the wedding's off...

800
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.380
...I bet Elliot's singing a new tune
and having the time of his life.

801
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:46.680
Cold. So cold.

802
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:51.560
I don't need anybody.
I can take care of myself.

803
00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:21.250
This... This is a good
character-building moment.

804
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:26.420
Elliot, remember,
you are a wild creature toughing it out.

805
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.300
I'll find Mr. Weenie all by myself.

806
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.760
I don't need anybody.
And I definitely don't need a girlfriend.

807
00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:38.480
So what if she tucks me in at night,
or listens to my problems?

808
00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:40.480
Makes really good
pine-cone crunchies...

809
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.440
...or rubs my head
when I have sickies?

810
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.530
Criminy, what have I done?

811
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.450
Giselle!

812
00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.790
Breaker, breaker.
Let's put the pedal to the metal.

813
00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.420
Ten-four.

814
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.920
Roberto, come on now.

815
00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.920
Hurry up.
Time to go to Pet Paradiso.

816
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:07.720
Did you hear that, Fif?
I'm so excited.

817
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.800
I'm looking forward
to the water slides and the buffet...

818
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.220
...and the pool and the babes.

819
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:15.600
How about you, Fifi?

820
00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:22.060
- Easy does it. Keep that ice pack on.
- Shut up!

821
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.900
Good advice, bud.

822
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:31.910
Here.

823
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.990
- Here.
- What Deni's trying to say is...

824
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.120
...this is where the Weenie was.

825
00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.330
- Gone.
- Oh, that's just great.

826
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.500
- Well, let's check it out.
- I'm on it.

827
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.670
What have we here?
Aye, Mr. Weenie was definitely here.

828
00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.930
Come on, Squiz.
What else you got for me?

829
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.640
And over here,
a titanic battle ensued.

830
00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:57.600
A battle? Are you serious?

831
00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:00.680
- Is he for real?
- Wait, wait, look.

832
00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:05.480
And here,
the unspeakable happened.

833
00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:07.150
- What?
- What's the unspeakable?

834
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.030
It's unspeakable because
the tracks end here. I got bupkis.

835
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.530
- Oh, brother, you got to be ki...
- Where do you think they went?

836
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:17.280
How would I know?
I'm a tracker, not a bleeding psychic.

837
00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.750
- What do you think, Boog?
- I don't know.

838
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:24.710
If only we had some kind of a sign.

839
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.880
- Come on, everyone.
- Oh, I hope this is the right way.

840
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.550
Stay sharp
and keep your eyes peeled.

841
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:37.890
Fifi, would you take a gander
at this?

842
00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:42.850
This, my half-pint friend,
puts the P in "paradise".

843
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.730
Oh, Roberto.

844
00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.570
- I can't... I can't do this.
- Come on, Fifi.

845
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.240
I think a bald spot
makes you look more sophisticated.

846
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.200
- Singe is the new pompadour.
- Oh, shut up!

847
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.410
Sure thing.

848
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.120
We gave him everything
he could've ever wanted, right, Bob?

849
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.590
I don't know if we should
go on living without him, Bob.

850
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:10.750
No, no, no.

851
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.760
He would want us to go on
living our lives, wouldn't he, Bob?

852
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.550
Road hog!

853
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.010
I knew you'd agree.

854
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.180
I'm free, I'm free

855
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.560
Sing it with me, Buddy.

856
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.770
Free at last, free at last

857
00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.110
What monstrosity is that?

858
00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:30.610
Scary.

859
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.070
Elliot?

860
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.110
Where are the others?

861
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.370
Oh, they're rescuing
Mr. Weenie and Buddy.

862
00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:41.950
- Hey, Buddy.
- Hi there.

863
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.200
- But Weenie...
- And Buddy.

864
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:44.410
- Are free like you.

865
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.080
Oh, yeah. I'm free.

866
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.130
Free to be alone
for the rest of my life.

867
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.460
You don't understand.

868
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.050
Our friends are heading
to Pet Paradiso.

869
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:56.720
Have them get me a T-shirt.

870
00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:00.470
The pets, they hate the wilds.

871
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.810
They're in serious danger.
Wake up, mein Freund.

872
00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.980
Weenie. When did you get here?

873
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:10.400
Don't you see?
Boog, McSquizzy, Giselle.

874
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.280
- They'll all be torn to pieces.
- Torn to pizzas?

875
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.240
- Pieces, you Strudelkopf.
- Pieces.

876
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.660
- Giselle's in trouble?
- Yeah, Giselle!

877
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:20.990
Well, why didn't you say so?
Giselle, my love!

878
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.250
- I'm coming to save you!
- You're going the wrong way.

879
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.370
No, I'm not...!

880
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.920
Goodbye.

881
00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.340
Look at all those RVs.

882
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:36.840
Weenie must be here.

883
00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.300
So how are we gonna get inside?

884
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.550
I'm a grizzly. No biggie.
We'll just walk in.

885
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.640
Look, just like that little guy.

886
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.350
Wild animal breach.

887
00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.940
Okay. Who's got
the next brilliant idea?

888
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.070
Aye, it's easy.
We could tunnel our way in.

889
00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.150
Or we could fly you all in.

890
00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.490
Oh, there's a great idea.

891
00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.870
A 1-pound bag of crazy
lifting a 1200-pound bag of lazy.

892
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.290
- What? I'm 900 pounds.
- That's crap.

893
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.370
- Oh, you think you so tough?
- Come on, is that your best shot?

894
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.750
- What do you got?
- Stop it.

895
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.130
- Stop it!
- Shove off.

896
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:13.710
Grow up, you two.

897
00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.550
Now, come on. Let's stay on track.

898
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:20.130
It looks safe enough.

899
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.550
Follow me.

900
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:34.060
What's wrong?

901
00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.030
Come on, spit it out.

902
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.950
Oh, you're so beautiful.

903
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:41.360
- Just like Mama.
- Okay.

904
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.280
I see a woman and her dog.

905
00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.530
Yeah. Look again.

906
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.830
- Oh, I'm gonna have nightmares!
- Quiet.

907
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.210
Come along, Jezzabelle. Heel.

908
00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:57.420
Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

909
00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:58.920
Definitely.

910
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:02.430
There we go. Perfecto.

911
00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:05.180
This is not at all what I was thinking.

912
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.180
- This'll never work.
- Yeah.

913
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:10.270
Sure it will. We look great.

914
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.770
What? I could sell this.

915
00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.570
Is he serious?

916
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.950
Boog, the idea
is to blend in with the pets.

917
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.910
She's right. You look ridiculous.

918
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.450
All right, fine.

919
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.410
- But if things get all crazy...
- We'll come get you. I promise.

920
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:37.170
Do I really have to wear a bow?
I look like a jessie.

921
00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.550
You're supposed to be a little dog,
and all little dogs wear bows.

922
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.470
What are you two looking at?
Keep an eye on them.

923
00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.300
Deni, follow me.

924
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:49.850
Okay.
All the time, "Deni, do this, do that".

925
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.100
Interesting.

926
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.100
Oh, poor Fifi.

927
00:48:55.270 --> 00:49:00.150
Here. A little zinc will help
protect that tender pink skin.

928
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.860
Have fun now.

929
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.360
It's not bad.

930
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:06.030
No one will even notice.

931
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:13.250
No one will notice?

932
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.290
- No one will notice?
- Okay.

933
00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:18.500
- He noticed. He noticed.
- Okay.

934
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:19.800
- I noticed.
- Take it...

935
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.170
- You noticed.
- I heard you.

936
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.050
- We all noticed. I noticed!
- I got it.

937
00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.260
Forget about it.

938
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:25.510
Me and my big mouth.

939
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.350
- One king and two doggy beds.
- And can I have synthetic pillows?

940
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:33.270
This is so weird.

941
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.860
Classic flattop. One of my favourites.

942
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:43.820
Of all the stupid...

943
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.360
- Quiet.
- Fresh cut. Come and get it.

944
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.530
This is the strangest place
I've ever seen.

945
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.370
Let's find Weenie
and get out of here.

946
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.750
Just ignore them.

947
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:55.870
Keep walking. No eye contact.

948
00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.750
What you looking at,
you wee bug-eyed freak?

949
00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.040
McSquizzy.

950
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:02.000
What did I just say?

951
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.380
- Get down, everyone.
- Go get it, boy. Fetch.

952
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:06.550
Fetch. Fetch it, buddy.

953
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.550
- Mine, mine, mine.
- One more.

954
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.220
This place is giving me
the skeevies.

955
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.890
Giselle!

956
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:18.650
- My spine.
- We're here.

957
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.610
This looks nothing like the brochure,
right, Weenie?

958
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.400
Pets and their owners.

959
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:29.870
They look so happy together.

960
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:33.240
Oh, I don't know if I can go in there
without my mama.

961
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:35.080
Oh, forget Mama.

962
00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.750
Giselle. We have to get in there
for Giselle.

963
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.250
- And the others.
- It's too much. I can't.

964
00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.250
Repeat after me: I'm wild.

965
00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:44.960
I'm wild.

966
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:46.380
With conviction.

967
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:47.880
I'm wild!

968
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.180
- What was that for?
- That was payback.

969
00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:51.890
Fair enough.

970
00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.390
What was that for?

971
00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.020
That one was just for fun.
Now' let's do this!

972
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.940
Might be a little cold.

973
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.810
That looks painful.

974
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.400
- Too hard?
- Poor guy, they stretched him out.

975
00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.740
Another round, Mr. Bailey?

976
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.900
Another round, Mr. Whiskers?

977
00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.030
Hey there, pretty lady.

978
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.330
Who's he calling a lady?

979
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.870
- Hey.
- Hello, baby.

980
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.210
Beat it, Doberman pinhead.
She's taken.

981
00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.460
Good looks and funny too.

982
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.800
But I was not talking to the Dalmatian,
little Miss Sugar-Snack.

983
00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:29.880
- Idiot. I'm not a girl!
- Hurry along. Let's not be rude.

984
00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:31.510
Hey, chica.

985
00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.680
You take care
of that body for Rico, huh?

986
00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.310
"Take care of that body"?

987
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:40.600
I'll give you "Take care of that body",
you big musclebound bag of...

988
00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.400
- There, there. I see them.
- Look, I spotted them.

989
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.110
- I still got it, eh?
- Genius.

990
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.280
- Mr. Weenie.
- Show yourself, laddie.

991
00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.490
Mr. Weenie?

992
00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:51.110
Weenie?

993
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:56.200
Roger, something's not right.
Do you smell something fishy here?

994
00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:58.790
Barracuda.

995
00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.620
Weenie.
Where are you, you wee pup...?

996
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.590
Oh, goodness me.

997
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:07.880
I think we have some dogs
of a different breed.

998
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.800
The girl with the bow, she's mine.

999
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:14.760
- We have to go.
- Yes, we're late. Very late.

1000
00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:18.430
- Stanley, it's the fishies.
- Not now, Roger.

1001
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:20.270
Oh, no.

1002
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:25.980
My friends, today justice
wears a blue barrette...

1003
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:29.820
...and a rhinestone collar.

1004
00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:33.110
Excuse me,
you got a wee something right there.

1005
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.490
Quiet! Squirrel! Varmint!

1006
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.540
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Come on, take it down a notch.

1007
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.210
- Shut up!
- Deni, this does not look good.

1008
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.210
- Let's go get Boog.
- Bad. Very bad.

1009
00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.550
- Quiet.
- Okay.

1010
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.050
Elliot, Weenie.
Thank goodness you're safe.

1011
00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:56.890
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

1012
00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.010
What do you mean?
I'm your best friend.

1013
00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.850
- McSquizzy?
- McSquizzy?

1014
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.230
He doesn't even like you.

1015
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:05.730
Look, I'm not talking to some
random overweight sheepdog...

1016
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.400
...about my personal relationships.
- It's me, Boog.

1017
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:11.530
- Boog's fatter. No way.
- Elliot.

1018
00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:13.570
It is you. Did you lose weight?

1019
00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:17.160
When did you start thinking
McSquizzy was your BFF?

1020
00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.490
Well, you were hibernating,
and we were hanging.

1021
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.750
Turns out we have a lot in common.
We both like nuts.

1022
00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.790
- You are nuts.
- Stop this insanity!

1023
00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:28.630
- Where are the others?
- They're inside looking for you.

1024
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.250
- And they've been captured!
- Captured?

1025
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.420
Oh, come on.

1026
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:36.340
Boog. I'm Boog.

1027
00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.100
No, Boog is a big fat guy.

1028
00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.600
- That's not you.
- I know.

1029
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.100
- I thought that he was McSquizzy too.
- Okay, stop. Would you all stop?

1030
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.810
- What do you mean, captured?
- They've been captured...

1031
00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.520
...by a gaggle of vicious domestics.

1032
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:51.110
- Enough talk.
- Hang on there' E.

1033
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.360
You don't wanna go stomping on
up in there.

1034
00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.780
- You're right. What we need is a...
- Don't say it.

1035
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.660
Don't say it.

1036
00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:01.280
- Plan!

1037
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:04.250
- This is not gonna work.
- It'll work.

1038
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.000
Don't doubt me, number two friend.

1039
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:09.460
- Trust the plan.
- Trust the plan.

1040
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.050
- Well, that was easy.
- See?

1041
00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.170
- I told you it would work.
- Hey!

1042
00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.300
- Just a minute!
- The plan's not gonna work.

1043
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:20.010
- The plan's not gonna work.
- Be cool. Hold it together.

1044
00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:23.970
Do you think you can just
waltz right in here...

1045
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:27.600
...without your room key,
Mrs. Schlapiano?

1046
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:28.980
You must've dropped this.

1047
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.650
A voice like an angel.

1048
00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.950
- I wonder where I left my room key.
- Wait a second!

1049
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.660
Nice try.

1050
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:43.830
You're not fooling anyone
with that phoney disguise.

1051
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.540
What are you wearing,
a porcupine on your head?

1052
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:48.790
Get out of here, you vagrant.

1053
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.920
- We made it.
- Yeah, that worked well.

1054
00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:54.670
Well, yes, because we had a plan.

1055
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.670
Giselle. Giselle, where are you?

1056
00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:01.010
Go.

1057
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:05.890
Help! Help!

1058
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.390
Help! Somebody, help us!

1059
00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.480
Scream all you like.
The humans can't hear you from here.

1060
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:14.520
And the house pets...

1061
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:19.860
...well, they hate wilds
just as much as I do!

1062
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:22.070
When I get free,
you're gonna pay for this...

1063
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.620
...you big tube, you numpty,
you big lassie's blouse.

1064
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.210
Watch your language, varmint.
There's a lady present.

1065
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:30.370
What a vile little creature.

1066
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:36.800
My friends, it is time
to tame these savage beasts.

1067
00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.880
You gotta be kidding me, right?

1068
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.720
Hey, Fif. Are you sure we can't
let the little girl squirrel go?

1069
00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:47.220
Yeah. Let the little girl squirrel go.

1070
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.560
Not a chance.

1071
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:51.900
Roberto, you know what to do.

1072
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.770
- Wha...? I don't know what you mean.
- Collar them, you fool.

1073
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.400
- Collar them, collar them, collar them.
- I hear you.

1074
00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:59.190
- Okay.
- Collar them, collar them...

1075
00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.320
...you fool.
- Calm down. Okay.

1076
00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.240
- The pool, so tempting.
- Forget the pool.

1077
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.330
- Elliot's right.
- Remember the objective.

1078
00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.040
- Oh, sweet libations.
- Control yourself.

1079
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.410
- The buffet. Wiener schnitzel?
- No. Forget food.

1080
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.920
- Strudel.
- He's not listening.

1081
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.750
- Mama's favourite.
- Oh, nuts.

1082
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:18.340
Boog, grab him.

1083
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.050
- Weenie.
- Come on. Come back here.

1084
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.130
- Way to go, Boog.
- You go on ahead.

1085
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.510
I'll catch up.

1086
00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:26.600
Leave us alone. Help!

1087
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:28.350
- Try this.
- Thanks.

1088
00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.270
- Help!
- Giselle.

1089
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:32.730
You fuzz ball,
you'll never get away with this.

1090
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:36.270
Oh, but I already have.

1091
00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:40.440
Oh, but you already haven't.

1092
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.700
- What are you doing?
- It's Mrs. Schlapiano.

1093
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:47.580
Get lost, old lady.
This does not concern you.

1094
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.080
I am no old lady.

1095
00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:53.120
- It is the porcupine in disguise.
- Yeah.

1096
00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.630
- I didn't see him up there. Did you?
- It's me, Elliot.

1097
00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.630
- Who is Elliot?
- I am.

1098
00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:03.630
And I'm here to rescue my lady,
kick butt and take names.

1099
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.090
What's your name?

1100
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:10.640
- Did anybody see that coming?
- Yes.

1101
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.980
- Even Roger saw that coming.
- I did?

1102
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:17.310
Come on, Weenie.
Snap out of it, man.

1103
00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:20.030
Das ist beautiful.

1104
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:22.650
Weenie, would you
come back here?

1105
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:24.240
Oh, man.

1106
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:28.240
Now how you gonna hide
a 900-pound bear?

1107
00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:30.540
A 1200-pound wild bear!

1108
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.450
What, 1200 pounds?

1109
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.420
Girl, you know that ain't right.
I'm 900 pounds.

1110
00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:39.500
This is mostly fur...

1111
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:41.590
...and fur adds
a hundred pounds easy.

1112
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:43.510
Go, go, go!

1113
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.840
I'll be bulking up to hibernate.
Just wait till I step out that...

1114
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.350
- Bear!
- Bear!

1115
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:50.810
We have a security breach.

1116
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:53.140
Perimeter has been compromised.

1117
00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:56.100
Telling you, I'm gonna be
the baddest bear ever in the woods.

1118
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:58.610
- We have a grizzly on the loose.
- Then we'll see...

1119
00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:01.360
...who's ready for swimming season.
- Darts loaded.

1120
00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:02.860
Fire!

1121
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:08.110
Hey, man, be cool. Back off.

1122
00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.320
Go.

1123
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:11.030
Little dude, go.

1124
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.830
You come back here right now.

1125
00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.710
Go.

1126
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:21.840
This is crazy.

1127
00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:28.390
Weenie!

1128
00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.600
Fifi, come on.
Is this really necessary?

1129
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:37.600
You see why
we have to do this, right?

1130
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:39.900
They will take everything.

1131
00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.230
Our food, our homes, our very lives!

1132
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:46.990
Wait. If this is the end,
I need to say something.

1133
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:51.410
- Giselle, I really, really, really...
- Really?

1134
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.120
- Time's up.
- Now, you hold your little old horses.

1135
00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:57.080
I do believe this boy's
got something on his mind.

1136
00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:00.880
- Yeah, give the guy a sporting chance.
- Oh, just forget it, Elliot.

1137
00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.920
You've already made it clear
how you feel.

1138
00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:06.550
I feel that this
has gone on long enough.

1139
00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.380
- Please let me finish.
- Fine.

1140
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:11.090
You've got 60 seconds.

1141
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.260
Are you serious?
How about a minute?

1142
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:16.100
- Hey, you better hurry up.
- Okay, okay.

1143
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.730
Giselle, before the wedding,
my rack was huge.

1144
00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:20.980
- What?
- It's true.

1145
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:24.520
Very huge. And it broke very bad.

1146
00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:28.110
And without my huge rack,
I felt like less of a buck.

1147
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.660
- But as time went on...
- Thirty seconds.

1148
00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:35.700
The point is, I'm a better buck
with not a huge rack on my head...

1149
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:39.210
...but with you, Giselle,
on my head instead.

1150
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:40.670
Oh, that's awful.

1151
00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:42.790
And how does this relate
to our wedding...

1152
00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:45.250
...and the fact that you left me
at the altar?

1153
00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:48.130
- Left you at the altar?
- You, sir, are a coward.

1154
00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.590
Oh, no.

1155
00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:55.810
- No, no. You are missing the point.
- Oh, come on.

1156
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:59.140
During our wedding, there was
the incident with the other woman.

1157
00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:00.440
Another woman?

1158
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.520
I can't even handle one.

1159
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:04.310
Speak for yourself, amigo.

1160
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.480
No. No.
Not that kind of other woman.

1161
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:08.150
The kind that grabbed Mr. Weenie.

1162
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.990
- You're disgusting.
- That is a pig.

1163
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:12.200
- You make me sick.
- This is getting good.

1164
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:16.660
- Isn't it refreshing?
- Come here, you.

1165
01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.250
Fifteen seconds.

1166
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.790
Will you, please?
Giselle, you are good.

1167
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.340
And me? Not always good.

1168
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.920
But with you, the me
that is not good can be better.

1169
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:31.510
You make my not-good me
almost not bad.

1170
01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.800
And that's not almost good,
it's almost great.

1171
01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:36.640
So, Giselle, you and me,
not badder, but greater.

1172
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:37.850
Understand?

1173
01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:40.350
- Tick, tick, tick!
- What is he talking about?

1174
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.600
Forget it.
Just push the button already.

1175
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:44.350
- Finally.
- No. Don't.

1176
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.940
Cannonball!

1177
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.150
Gotcha.

1178
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.980
I love you, Boog.

1179
01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.530
Goodness me.

1180
01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.410
Hold on, now.

1181
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:01.870
There it is.

1182
01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.210
- That was close.
- Is everybody okay?

1183
01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.540
You're still in danger.

1184
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:07.210
The Fifi will kill you all.

1185
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.840
Get the collars off.

1186
01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.880
Fifi, where are you going?

1187
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:14.550
Mr. Weenie?

1188
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.050
Let's get you out of those ropes.

1189
01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.310
- Boog, look out.
- Take cover.

1190
01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:24.060
Elliot, you take care of these guys.
I'll draw the others away.

1191
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.230
- We gotta get these off.
- Thank you.

1192
01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:28.690
I won't let you hurt my friends.

1193
01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.400
Hey.

1194
01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:33.190
Weenie's in trouble. I gotta go.

1195
01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.240
- Weenie, I'm coming.
- Elliot, careful.

1196
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.990
Breaker, breaker.
Mudflaps, do you read me? Over.

1197
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.290
This is Mudflaps. Over.

1198
01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:43.870
You're not gonna believe it.

1199
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.540
Mr. Weenie just
ran by me poolside.

1200
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:49.250
- Over.
- Bob, they found Mr. Weenie.

1201
01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.590
Hurry. Get in.

1202
01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:55.050
Hey, where's the fire, huh?

1203
01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.720
Oh, boy. There it is.

1204
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.890
Mr. Weenie, Mama's coming, baby.

1205
01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.560
Mama's coming.

1206
01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:12.360
Hey, Chet, lock up, would you?

1207
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:14.400
I'm calling it a day, huh?

1208
01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:19.910
Finally, some alone time.

1209
01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:24.290
Look out there, doggy.

1210
01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.120
Weenie. Weenie.

1211
01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.540
- Are you all right?
- Weenie's fine. Get the remote.

1212
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:30.880
- I got it.
- Take this!

1213
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:34.760
Oh, no, you don't.

1214
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.640
Oh, my.

1215
01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.480
Save Rico, chica. Save Rico.

1216
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:49.810
There's so many.

1217
01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:53.110
Lock and load.

1218
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.440
Pull!

1219
01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.280
Stanley, duck.

1220
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:02.660
Man down. I'm hit.

1221
01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:06.290
See? One duck, two duck.

1222
01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.830
We did it.

1223
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
- Come on, Rico.
- Rico got your back, baby.

1224
01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:12.920
Take that.

1225
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:15.460
Fire!

1226
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:21.840
Saved by the slobber.

1227
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:24.930
- Get him off me! Get him off!
- Take this, you wild beast!

1228
01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:27.100
Oh, no.

1229
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.020
- That's Elliot.
- That ain't good. Let's go.

1230
01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:37.070
- Elliot?
- Oh, no.

1231
01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.700
- Rico, where is he?
- Oh, man.

1232
01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.570
- He's gotta get those collars off.
- Stop.

1233
01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.370
Or everyone gets it.

1234
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:46.290
Do you understand?

1235
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:52.460
- Elliot. You okay?
- Yes, yes.

1236
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:55.710
- You could've gotten here sooner.
- You're breathing, aren't you?

1237
01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.340
Let this be an example to you all.

1238
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:01.880
- No, don't.
- No, Fifi, no.

1239
01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:03.890
- Don't do it.
- Fifi, stop. Seriously.

1240
01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:06.390
- Don't do it, Fifi.
- Don't push the button.

1241
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.680
Hold on, pal.

1242
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.810
This is it.

1243
01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.690
Oh, no.

1244
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:20.740
What? How did you do that?

1245
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.740
The old switcheroo, Boog.

1246
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:28.620
That was not fair.

1247
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.370
I gotta be honest with you.

1248
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.080
He kind of had that coming.

1249
01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:36.130
Ice cream.

1250
01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.760
Hang in there, Hoppy.

1251
01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.260
But, officers, Fox Jaws
said Mr. Weenie was here.

1252
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:44.010
Are you sure you haven't seen him?

1253
01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:47.350
Why don't you run through
that description for me one more time.

1254
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.770
Yeah, Dispatch,
we got a male Caucasian...

1255
01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:52.850
...early 30s,
sustaining multiple pheno injections.

1256
01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.520
- We're sending him over to County.
- Go...

1257
01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:57.730
You heard him. Go.

1258
01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.150
He's also dark brown
and long and jiggly...

1259
01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.450
...and he walks
with the cutest little waddle.

1260
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.410
Does this match the description
of your dog, ma'am?

1261
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:09.620
Oh, Mr. Weenie.

1262
01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:12.750
I miss you so much.

1263
01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.210
Hey, Roberto, my main man.

1264
01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.790
- I appreciate the help out there.
- Sure thing.

1265
01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.130
And if you're ever
in the city, come on by.

1266
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.720
We'll split a pizza pie. My treat.

1267
01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:29.140
From this day forward, domestics
and wilds will live together as one.

1268
01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:31.850
So your doghouse or mine, chica?

1269
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:36.150
Hey, Rico, come here.
Let me share a wee secret with you.

1270
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:38.110
I'm not a girl!

1271
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:42.820
What? Señor, you have played
with Rico's emotions.

1272
01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.110
Come on, Elliot.
Time to head on home.

1273
01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.490
- I hear you. Come on, Giselle.
- All right, everybody. Take it easy.

1274
01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:52.200
Well' it's time to swap spit
and hit the road.

1275
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:54.250
You said it, cowboy.

1276
01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.170
- Hold on. Wait for me.
- Bye-bye.

1277
01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:57.670
Hey, wait, Mr. Weenie.

1278
01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.340
Aren't you coming?

1279
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.210
Well, I have decided
not to go with you.

1280
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.760
- Why not?
- Because just like you...

1281
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:09.600
...I have realised that if you're never
tied to anything, you'll never be free.

1282
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.310
- We're not tied together anymore.
- This is figurative.

1283
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:14.180
So we have to be tied up in order...?

1284
01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:16.600
No. We must have limits
to be limitless.

1285
01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.270
Find a seat. This could take a while.

1286
01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.980
All that matters
is to be with the one you love...

1287
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:25.030
...und the one that loves you.

1288
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.030
You're not making
any sense, Weenie.

1289
01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.700
I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life
with the one who loves me:

1290
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:32.540
Giselle.

1291
01:06:33.330 --> 01:06:35.200
Wait for me.

1292
01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:36.410
Goodbye, my friends.

1293
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.370
I will miss you all!

1294
01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:42.040
Weenie. It's been ages.

1295
01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.800
- Here's my chance.
- Roger.

1296
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.550
Let's go find your buddy Stanley.

1297
01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.550
No, no, no. He's your friend now.

1298
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:52.220
- It's so sad, isn't it, Bob?
- Okay, okay.

1299
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:54.890
Calm down. Calm down.

1300
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.190
Look. There he is. Long and jiggly.

1301
01:06:57.350 --> 01:07:00.230
Mr. Weenie? Is that you?

1302
01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.570
Mr. Weenie.

1303
01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:10.660
Mr. Weenie!

1304
01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:13.740
Oh, my baby.

1305
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:17.080
You came back to Mama.

1306
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:18.500
Don't lose him again, now.

1307
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:20.960
- That dog loves you.
- Never.

1308
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:24.590
Oh, no. The woman-beast
is torturing him again.

1309
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.760
What? Is that what you call torture?

1310
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:32.760
Yeah. Why do you ask?

1311
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:35.140
Why? Man,
she's showing him affection.

1312
01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:38.430
You know, kiss, kiss, hug, hug.

1313
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:41.440
I might have misread that.

1314
01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:43.060
You might have misread that?

1315
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:45.690
- Let me at him!
- Hey, hey. Come on now.

1316
01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.780
- Come on.
- Don't let go of him, Boog.

1317
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:51.780
- Take it easy.
- Well, enough of that hullabaloo.

1318
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:55.120
You know what, Giselle?
Mr. Weenie was right.

1319
01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:56.620
About what?

1320
01:07:56.790 --> 01:08:00.790
About, you know, all that stuff
about what really matters.

1321
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.170
Stuff? Oh, Elliot.

1322
01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.090
How do I know you really feel it
if you can't even say it?

1323
01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.630
- Well, do I have to spell it out for you?
- Yes.

1324
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.930
- Okay. You, me, together for...
- Hello.

1325
01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.140
You were saying?

1326
01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:17.350
It's me and you for...

1327
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.640
- Go on.
- Okay, what I'm trying to say is...

1328
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:23.020
Why do these birds and ducks
suddenly appear...

1329
01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:25.520
...every time you're near?

1330
01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.360
Unless, like me...

1331
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:31.820
...they long to be close to you.

1332
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:34.950
Oh, Elliot,
that's the most romantic thing...

1333
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:40.290
Why do stars fall down from the sky

1334
01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.590
Every time you walk by?

1335
01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:47.840
Just like me

1336
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:50.340
They long to be

1337
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:54.300
Close to you

1338
01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:59.310
On the day that you were born
The angels got together

1339
01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:03.770
And decided to create
A dream come true

1340
01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:06.900
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold

1341
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:12.530
And starlight in your eyes of blue

1342
01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:18.080
That is why
All the girls in town

1343
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:19.370
Follow me...

1344
01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.700
- Oh, dear.
... all around.

1345
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:22.960
It's true.

1346
01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:25.460
Just like me

1347
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:27.710
They long to be

1348
01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.380
Close to you

1349
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.880
Just like me

1350
01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:38.470
They long to be

1351
01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.060
Close to you

1352
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:45.810
Giselle, I love you.

1353
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.020
You said it!

1354
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:49.730
I love you, Elliot.

1355
01:09:51.570 --> 01:09:52.820
Yeah, that's my man.

1356
01:09:52.990 --> 01:10:05.540
Close to you

1357
01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:07.040
Not too close.

1358
01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.550
Close to you

1359
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.430
I love this song.

1360
01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.180
Close to you

1361
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:26.100
Oh, Roberto, that's beautiful.

1362
01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.280
Close to you

1363
01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.280
Sing it, Bob.

1364
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:44.450
Big finish now.

1365
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:51.460
Elliot?

1366
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.640
Close to you

1367
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:02.260
That just ain't right.

1368
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:04.390
Come on!

1369
01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:12.920
