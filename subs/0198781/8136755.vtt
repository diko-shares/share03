1
00:01:31.887 --> 00:01:33.928
- Good night, sweetheart.
- 'Night, Mom.

2
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:35.367
Sleep tight, kiddo.

3
00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:04.767
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>

4
00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:08.128
<i>Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.</i>

5
00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.448
<i>Simulation terminated.</i>

6
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:15.208
- All right. Mr. Bile, is it?
- My friends call me Phlegm.

7
00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:18.648
Mr. Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

8
00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:21.928
- I fell down?
- No, no, before that.

9
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:25.288
Can anyone tell me
Mr. Bile's big mistake?

10
00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:27.367
Anyone?

11
00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:31.848
Let's take a look at the tape.
Here we go.

12
00:03:32.288 --> 00:03:34.647
Right there.

13
00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:37.168
See? The door.
You left it wide open.

14
00:03:38.288 --> 00:03:41.048
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

15
00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:44.168
any employee can make because...

16
00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:48.968
- It could let in a draft?
- It could let in a child.

17
00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.367
Mr. Waternoose.

18
00:03:51.527 --> 00:03:56.088
There's nothing more toxic or deadly
than a human child.

19
00:03:56.328 --> 00:03:58.448
A single touch could kill you.

20
00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:03.048
Leave a door open and a child
could walk right into this factory,

21
00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:04.728
right into the monster world.

22
00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.168
I won't go in a kid's room.
You can't make me.

23
00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.287
You're going in there
because we need this.

24
00:04:16.607 --> 00:04:20.568
Our city is counting on you
to collect those children's screams.

25
00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:23.327
Without scream we have no power.

26
00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:25.408
Yes, it's dangerous work.

27
00:04:25.488 --> 00:04:28.248
And that's why I need you
to be at your best.

28
00:04:28.328 --> 00:04:31.967
I need scarers who are
confident, tenacious, tough.

29
00:04:32.328 --> 00:04:33.728
Intimidating.

30
00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:39.208
I need scarers like...
Like James P. Sullivan.

31
00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:46.008
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis.
It's five after 6:00 a.m.

32
00:04:46.087 --> 00:04:47.768
in the big Monster City.

33
00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:51.408
The temperature's a balmy 65 degrees
which is good for you reptiles.

34
00:04:51.488 --> 00:04:55.368
And it looks like it's gonna be
a perfect day to lie in bed, sleep in,

35
00:04:55.568 --> 00:04:59.808
or simply work off that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

36
00:04:59.888 --> 00:05:01.408
Get up, Sulley!

37
00:05:03.488 --> 00:05:05.848
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

38
00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:08.408
Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

39
00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:11.648
Feel the burn.
You call yourself a monster?

40
00:05:11.968 --> 00:05:14.168
Scary feet, scary feet.
The kid's awake!

41
00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:16.848
Scary feet, scary feet, scary feet.
Kid's asleep!

42
00:05:18.288 --> 00:05:20.088
Twins! In a bunk bed!

43
00:05:21.768 --> 00:05:23.328
I thought I had you there.

44
00:05:23.408 --> 00:05:26.888
OK, Sulley, here we go.
You ready? Follow it. It's over here.

45
00:05:26.968 --> 00:05:30.368
Over there. Don't let the kid touch you.
Don't let him touch you!

46
00:05:30.488 --> 00:05:33.728
<i>I don't know but it's been said
I love scarin' kids in bed</i>

47
00:05:33.808 --> 00:05:37.048
Fight that plaque.
Scary monsters don't have plaque.

48
00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.368
One-eighteen. Do you have 119?

49
00:05:39.448 --> 00:05:41.008
Do I see 120?

50
00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:43.648
- I don't believe it.
- I'm not breaking a sweat.

51
00:05:43.728 --> 00:05:46.008
Not you. Look!
The new commercial's on.

52
00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:49.928
<i>The future is bright
at Monsters, Incorporated.</i>

53
00:05:50.008 --> 00:05:52.088
<i>- I'm in this one.
- We're pan' of your life.</i>

54
00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:54.848
<i>We power your car.
We warm your home.</i>

55
00:05:54.928 --> 00:05:56.568
<i>We light your city.</i>

56
00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:59.048
<i>- I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
- Hey, look! Betty!</i>

57
00:05:59.488 --> 00:06:02.808
<i>Carefully matching every child
to their ideal monster,</i>

58
00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:04.888
<i>to produce superior scream.</i>

59
00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:07.688
<i>Refined into clean,
dependable energy.</i>

60
00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:12.248
<i>Every time you turn something on,
Monsters, Incorporated is there.</i>

61
00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:15.648
<i>- I'm Monsters, Incorporated.
- We know the challenge.</i>

62
00:06:15.728 --> 00:06:17.648
<i>The window of innocence is shrinking.</i>

63
00:06:17.728 --> 00:06:20.128
<i>Human kids are harder to scare.</i>

64
00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:22.648
<i>Of course,
MI is prepared for the future.</i>

65
00:06:22.728 --> 00:06:24.568
<i>With the top scarers,</i>

66
00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:26.248
<i>the best refineries,</i>

67
00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:28.929
<i>and research into
new energy techniques.</i>

68
00:06:29.808 --> 00:06:31.368
OK, here I come.

69
00:06:31.448 --> 00:06:33.848
<i>We're working for a better tomorrow,</i>

70
00:06:33.928 --> 00:06:37.368
<i>- today.
- We're Monsters, Incorporated.</i>

71
00:06:37.608 --> 00:06:40.248
<i>We're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.</i>

72
00:06:40.328 --> 00:06:42.568
<i>We scare because we care.</i>

73
00:06:44.648 --> 00:06:46.648
- I can't believe it.
- Mike.

74
00:06:46.728 --> 00:06:48.928
I was on TV!

75
00:06:49.288 --> 00:06:51.168
Did you see me? I'm a natural.

76
00:06:51.808 --> 00:06:54.368
Hello?
I know! Wasn't I great?

77
00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:56.888
Did the whole family see it?
It's your mom.

78
00:06:56.968 --> 00:06:58.728
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

79
00:07:10.568 --> 00:07:13.848
I'm telling you, you're gonna
be seeing this face on TV more often.

80
00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:16.448
<i>Yeah'? On Monstropolis' Most Wanted?</i>

81
00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:20.368
You've been jealous of my good looks
since the fourth grade.

82
00:07:20.448 --> 00:07:22.568
- Have a good day, sweetie.
- You too, hon.

83
00:07:24.368 --> 00:07:26.488
- OK, Sulley, hop on in.
- Nope.

84
00:07:26.568 --> 00:07:29.648
- Hey, where you going?
- Mikey, there's a scream shortage.

85
00:07:29.728 --> 00:07:31.368
- We're walking.
- Walking?

86
00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:33.208
- No, no.
- Come on.

87
00:07:33.288 --> 00:07:34.728
My baby needs to be driven.

88
00:07:34.808 --> 00:07:36.888
My baby. I'll call you.

89
00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:41.448
- You know why I bought the car?
- Not really.

90
00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:44.609
To drive it. You know,
on the street with the honk, honk,

91
00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:48.368
- no walking involved.
- Give it a rest, will ya, butterball?

92
00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:51.688
- You could use the exercise.
- I could use the exercise? Look at you.

93
00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:53.409
You have your own climate.

94
00:07:53.488 --> 00:07:55.888
- How many tentacles jump the rope?
- How many tentacles jump the rope?

95
00:07:55.968 --> 00:07:57.688
Morning, Mike. Morning, Sulley.

96
00:07:57.769 --> 00:07:59.569
Morning, kids. How you doing?

97
00:07:59.648 --> 00:08:03.409
- Hi, Mike. Bye, Sulley.
- Hey!

98
00:08:09.928 --> 00:08:11.209
Nuts.

99
00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:16.128
- FeHas.
- Hey, Tony.

100
00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:18.808
Tony, TOW-

101
00:08:19.408 --> 00:08:22.568
I hear somebody's close to breaking
the all-time scare record.

102
00:08:23.048 --> 00:08:26.569
Just trying to make sure
there's enough scream to go around.

103
00:08:26.648 --> 00:08:29.248
- Hey, on the house.
- Hey, thanks.

104
00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:30.608
Bada-bing.

105
00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.608
Oh, great.

106
00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:38.008
Hey, Ted, good morning.

107
00:08:41.568 --> 00:08:43.528
See that, Mikey?
Ted's walking to work.

108
00:08:43.609 --> 00:08:46.329
Big deal.
Guy takes five steps and he's there.

109
00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:54.809
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

110
00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:57.808
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

111
00:08:57.888 --> 00:08:59.288
- M0rnin', Sulley.
- M0rnin', Ricky.

112
00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:01.648
- It's the Sullster.
- See you on the scare floor.

113
00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:04.569
- Hey Marge. How was jury duty?
- Morning, Sulley.

114
00:09:04.648 --> 00:09:05.728
Hey.

115
00:09:06.568 --> 00:09:08.409
Hey. It's still leaning to the left.

116
00:09:08.488 --> 00:09:11.129
- It is not.
- Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.

117
00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:15.048
- Hey, Mr. Sullivan.
- Guys, I told you, call me Sulley.

118
00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:19.249
- I don't think so.
- We want to wish you good luck today.

119
00:09:19.328 --> 00:09:23.008
Hey, hey, get lost, you two.
You're making him lose his focus.

120
00:09:23.128 --> 00:09:24.849
- Sorry.
- See you later, fellas.

121
00:09:24.928 --> 00:09:26.489
Go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan.

122
00:09:26.568 --> 00:09:28.888
Quiet.
You're making him lose his focus.

123
00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:31.208
- Oh, no. Sorry!
- Shut up!

124
00:09:31.849 --> 00:09:35.328
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.

125
00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:38.368
Miss Fearmonger is on vacation.
Would you like her voice-mail?

126
00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:41.849
- Schmoopsie-pooh.
- Googly bear.

127
00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:46.249
- Happy birthday.
- Googly-woogly, you remembered.

128
00:09:46.568 --> 00:09:50.089
- Hey, Sulley-wulley.
- Hey, Celia-wheelie.

129
00:09:50.728 --> 00:09:52.648
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

130
00:09:52.969 --> 00:09:55.849
So are we going
anywhere special tonight?

131
00:09:56.048 --> 00:10:00.209
I just got us into a little place
called Harryhausen's.

132
00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:04.369
Harryhausen's? But it's impossible
to get a reservation there.

133
00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:07.769
Not for googly bear.
I will see you at quittin' time.

134
00:10:07.848 --> 00:10:09.849
- Not a minute later.
- OK, sweetheart.

135
00:10:09.928 --> 00:10:11.688
Think romantical thoughts.

136
00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:14.968
<i>You and me
Me and you</i>

137
00:10:15.049 --> 00:10:16.809
<i>Both of us together</i>

138
00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:19.289
You know, pal, she's the one.

139
00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:22.049
- That's it. She is the one.
- I'm happy for you.

140
00:10:22.128 --> 00:10:24.489
Thanks for hooking me up
with those reservations.

141
00:10:24.568 --> 00:10:27.529
They're under the name "googly bear."

142
00:10:27.608 --> 00:10:30.488
Good...
You know, that wasn't very funny.

143
00:10:33.768 --> 00:10:36.009
- What the...
- Wazowski.

144
00:10:37.969 --> 00:10:38.929
What do you know?

145
00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:41.769
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

146
00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:45.209
I wasn't scared.
I have allergies.

147
00:10:46.648 --> 00:10:49.408
- Sure.
- Randall, save it for the scare floor.

148
00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:53.209
I'm in the zone today, Sullivan.
Gonna do serious scaring.

149
00:10:53.289 --> 00:10:56.329
- Putting up some big numbers.
- Randall, that's great.

150
00:10:56.408 --> 00:11:00.409
That should make it more humiliating
when we break the record first.

151
00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:05.369
Do you hear that?
It's the winds of change.

152
00:11:08.048 --> 00:11:09.929
"You hear that? It's the winds of..."

153
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:12.889
What a creep.
One of these days I am really

154
00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:15.689
gonnaletyou
teach that guy a lesson.

155
00:11:22.409 --> 00:11:24.329
Chalooby. Baby.

156
00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.288
Good morning, Roz,
my succulent garden snail.

157
00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:32.448
- Who would we be scaring today?
- Wazowski.

158
00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:34.928
You didn't file your paperwork
last night.

159
00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:36.769
Oh, that darn paperwork.

160
00:11:36.848 --> 00:11:40.049
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

161
00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:43.769
Don't let it happen again.

162
00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:46.809
Yes. Well, I'll try to be less careless.

163
00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:49.609
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

164
00:11:49.728 --> 00:11:51.689
Always watching.

165
00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:53.769
- She's nuts.
- Always.

166
00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:56.929
<i>All scare floors are now active.</i>

167
00:11:57.329 --> 00:12:00.089
<i>Assistants, please report
to your stations.</i>

168
00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:47.889
OK, people,
Eastern Seaboard coming online.

169
00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:49.928
We got scarers coming out.

170
00:13:04.169 --> 00:13:06.329
They are so awesome.

171
00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:53.449
Hey, may the best monster win.

172
00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:55.289
I plan to.

173
00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:59.769
We are on in seven, six, five,

174
00:14:00.049 --> 00:14:03.129
four, three, two...

175
00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:11.409
You're the boss.
You're the big hairy boss.

176
00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:22.689
I'm feeling good today, Mikey.

177
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.929
Attaboy. Another door coming right up.

178
00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:35.769
You're still behind, Randall.

179
00:14:35.849 --> 00:14:38.810
- Maybe I should realign the scream...
- Get me a door.

180
00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:40.170
Door, yes, door.

181
00:15:04.809 --> 00:15:06.969
Well, Jerry, what's the damage so far?

182
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.089
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

183
00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:12.169
First time in a month.

184
00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.209
- What happened?
- The kid almost touched me.

185
00:15:21.289 --> 00:15:24.289
- She got this close to me.
- She wasn't scared of you?

186
00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:26.729
- She was only six.
- I could have been dead.

187
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.370
- I could have died.
- Keep it together, man.

188
00:15:31.249 --> 00:15:33.569
Hey, we got a dead door over here.

189
00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.850
- I'm coming.
- Look out.

190
00:15:36.729 --> 00:15:38.050
Excuse us.

191
00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:43.250
We've lost 58 doors this week, sir.

192
00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:45.290
Kids these days.

193
00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:47.490
They just don't get scared
like they used to.

194
00:15:48.009 --> 00:15:49.449
Let her rip.

195
00:16:00.849 --> 00:16:02.450
- Sir?
- What?

196
00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:04.009
Look.

197
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:08.169
<i>Attention.
We have a new scare leader.</i>

198
00:16:08.249 --> 00:16:09.809
<i>Randall Boggs.</i>

199
00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:13.089
Look at those numbers.

200
00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:19.689
Slumber party.

201
00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:23.649
<i>Never mind.</i>

202
00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:26.609
Hey, watch it.

203
00:16:28.289 --> 00:16:31.329
Well, James,
that was an impressive display.

204
00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:33.609
Just doing my job, Mr. Waternoose.

205
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.009
'Course I did learn from the best.

206
00:16:36.649 --> 00:16:39.450
If I don't see a new door
in my station in five seconds,

207
00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:42.490
I will personally
put you through the shredder.

208
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:47.369
Hey, Wazowski, nice job.
Those numbers are pretty sweet.

209
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.890
Are they?
You know, I hadn't even noticed.

210
00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:52.569
- And how's Georgie doing?
- He's doing great.

211
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.570
I love working with that big guy.

212
00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.010
Keep the doors coming.
I'm on a roll today.

213
00:16:57.089 --> 00:17:00.649
George and I are like brothers. 2319!

214
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:01.850
We have a 2319!

215
00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.250
<i>Red alert.</i>

216
00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:11.130
<i>Red alert, red alert.</i>

217
00:17:11.209 --> 00:17:13.249
<i>- Red alert.
- George Sanderson.</i>

218
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.129
<i>Please remain motionless.
Prepare for decontamination.</i>

219
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.130
Duck and cover, people!

220
00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:24.249
Not the CDA.

221
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.210
<i>- Go, go, go.
- Coming through. Stand aside.</i>

222
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.729
<i>Clear the contaminated area.</i>

223
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:40.370
<i>- A 2319 in progress.
- Coming through. Watch yourself.</i>

224
00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.810
<i>Stand back. Careful.</i>

225
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.890
<i>All clear. Situation is
niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.</i>

226
00:18:04.969 --> 00:18:08.050
- Thanks, guys, that was a close one.
- OK.

227
00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:22.809
Take a break. We gotta shut down
and reset the system.

228
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.330
An entire scare floor out of commission.

229
00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:27.250
What else can go wrong?

230
00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.649
- What a day.
- We're just going through a rough time.

231
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.849
Everyone knows
you'll get us through it.

232
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.370
Tell that to the board of directors.

233
00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:42.730
James, this company's been
in my family for three generations.

234
00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:45.689
I would do anything
to keep it from going under.

235
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.730
So would I, sir.

236
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.250
- I could use your help with something.
- Anything, sir.

237
00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.610
We've hired some new scare recruits,
and frankly, they're...

238
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.689
- inexperienced?
- They stink.

239
00:19:00.209 --> 00:19:02.330
I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

240
00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:04.410
and give them a demonstration.

241
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.290
Show them what it takes
to be our top scarer.

242
00:19:07.369 --> 00:19:10.570
I'll start out with the old
Waternoose jump and growl.

243
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.610
Now that's my boy.

244
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.010
Let's go, everybody.
All doors must be returned.

245
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.810
No exceptions.

246
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.090
I've never seen anything like you today.
You were on a roll.

247
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.890
Another day like this
and that scare record's in the bag.

248
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.050
That's right, baby.

249
00:19:43.689 --> 00:19:47.010
As if dinner wasn't enough,
I'm taking her to a monster truck rally.

250
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.530
- Nice.
- What's on your agenda?

251
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.930
- Work out some more.
- Again?

252
00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:53.490
There's more to life than scaring.

253
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:59.130
- Can I borrow your odorant?
- I got smelly garbage or old dumpster.

254
00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.010
You got low tide?
How about wet dog?

255
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.610
Yep. Stink it up.

256
00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.170
I am so romantic sometimes
I think I should marry myself.

257
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.130
- Give me a break.
- What a night of romance ahead of me.

258
00:20:12.209 --> 00:20:15.369
Tonight is about me and Celia.

259
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.610
The love boat is about to set sail.

260
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.450
I gotta tell you, that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

261
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.610
Hello, Wazowski.
Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?

262
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.890
Well, as a matter of fact...

263
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.210
I'm sure you filed
your paperwork correctly,

264
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.890
for once.

265
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.490
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

266
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.850
My scare reports.
I left them on my desk.

267
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.170
If I'm not at the restaurant in five
minutes they'll give our table away.

268
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:45.770
- Schmoopsie-pooh.
- Googly bear.

269
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.570
- Want to get going?
- Do I ever. It's just...

270
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:49.930
- What?
- It...

271
00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.090
- A small...
- I don't understand.

272
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.490
I forgot about some paperwork
I was supposed to file.

273
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.210
Mike was reminding me.

274
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.090
- Thanks, buddy.
- I was?

275
00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.610
I mean, I was. Yeah.

276
00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.770
- OK. Let's go.
- We're going.

277
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.730
The pink copies to accounting.

278
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.370
The fuchsia ones go to purchasing
and the goldenrod ones go to Roz.

279
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.890
Leave the puce.

280
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.170
Pink copies to accounting,
fuchsia ones to Roz.

281
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.170
The fuchsia ones go to purchasing.

282
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.930
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

283
00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.810
Man, I have no idea what puce is.

284
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:25.170
Oh, that's puce.

285
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.850
Hello?

286
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.370
Anyone? There's a door here.

287
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.050
Hello? Hey.

288
00:21:58.211 --> 00:21:59.690
Anybody scaring in here?

289
00:22:00.411 --> 00:22:02.530
Hello. Yo.

290
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.811
Kitty.

291
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.531
No, no, stay back.

292
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.371
Hold it, hold it.

293
00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:08.251
Michael, I've had a lot of birthdays...
Well, not a lot of birthdays.

294
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.530
But this is the best birthday ever.

295
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.530
What are you looking at?

296
00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:16.570
I was just thinking about
the first time I laid eye on you,

297
00:25:16.651 --> 00:25:19.010
- how pretty you looked.
- Stop it.

298
00:25:19.091 --> 00:25:22.651
- Your hair was shorter.
- I'm thinking about getting it cut.

299
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.611
No, no, I like it this length.

300
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.091
I like everything about you.

301
00:25:26.611 --> 00:25:30.051
Just the other day someone asked
who was the most beautiful monster.

302
00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:32.931
- You know what I said?
- What did you say?

303
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.250
Isaid...

304
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.371
- SUlley?
- SUlley?

305
00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.851
No, no, that's not what
I was gonna say.

306
00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:39.971
You're not making sense.

307
00:25:40.051 --> 00:25:43.811
- He's handsome. He's rugged.
- What a coincidence, running into you.

308
00:25:44.051 --> 00:25:46.371
- I'm just gonna order something.
- Michael.

309
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.971
- What's good?
- You're ruining everything.

310
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.771
I went to get your paperwork
and there was a door.

311
00:25:51.851 --> 00:25:52.971
What?

312
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.890
- A door?
- Randall was in it.

313
00:25:56.971 --> 00:26:00.371
Randall? That cheater.
He's trying to boost his numbers.

314
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.011
- There's something else.
- What?

315
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.051
Ooklay in the agbay.

316
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:06.210
- What?
- Look in the bag.

317
00:26:07.211 --> 00:26:08.331
What bag?

318
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:18.970
They don't have anything
I like here. Take care, Celia.

319
00:26:19.051 --> 00:26:22.211
- What's going on?
- Celia, please try to understand.

320
00:26:22.411 --> 00:26:25.250
- I have to do something!
- Michael?

321
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.931
On three. One, two...

322
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.810
- A kid!
- Boo!

323
00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.570
A kid!

324
00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:42.331
There's a kid here.
A human kid!

325
00:26:46.211 --> 00:26:47.531
Googly bear!

326
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.131
Come on.

327
00:26:59.091 --> 00:27:00.490
Let's get out of here.

328
00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:04.091
<i>Please remain calm.
This is not a drill.</i>

329
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.491
<i>7835 in progress, please advise.</i>

330
00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:11.610
- Michael? Michael!
- Celia!

331
00:27:11.691 --> 00:27:13.051
<i>- Come with me.
- Stop pushing.</i>

332
00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:15.011
Get your hands off
my schmoopsie-pooh.

333
00:27:16.011 --> 00:27:17.451
<i>Ready for decontamination.</i>

334
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:21.051
I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

335
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.530
<i>If witnesses are to be believed,
there has been a child security breach</i>

336
00:27:30.611 --> 00:27:32.811
<i>for the first time in monster history.</i>

337
00:27:32.891 --> 00:27:36.251
<i>We neither confirm nor deny
the presence of a human child here.</i>

338
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:40.371
<i>Well, a kid flew right over me and
blasted a car with its laser vision.</i>

339
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:43.531
<i>I tried to run, but it picked me up
with its mind powers</i>

340
00:27:43.611 --> 00:27:44.851
<i>and shook me like a doll.</i>

341
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.051
<i>It's true.
I saw the whole thing.</i>

342
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:52.171
<i>It is my professional opinion
that now is the time to panic.</i>

343
00:27:56.651 --> 00:27:58.571
It's coming. It's coming!

344
00:27:59.451 --> 00:28:00.491
Boo!

345
00:28:06.891 --> 00:28:08.491
No,no,no,no!

346
00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:10.411
Come here, kid.

347
00:28:12.731 --> 00:28:14.971
Don't touch those, you little...

348
00:28:15.051 --> 00:28:17.331
Those were alphabetized.
It's OK.

349
00:28:17.411 --> 00:28:20.691
As long as it doesn't come near us
we're gonna be OK.

350
00:28:30.051 --> 00:28:32.091
You like this? Fetch.

351
00:28:34.331 --> 00:28:37.131
Hey, hey. That's it.
No one touches Little Mikey.

352
00:28:39.731 --> 00:28:41.611
Mike, give her the bear.

353
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:44.491
Oh, no!

354
00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:00.251
Make it stop, Sulley.
Make it stop!

355
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:03.251
Here, look. See bear?
Nice bear.

356
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:04.811
Sulley!

357
00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:08.611
Bear, he's a happy bear.

358
00:29:08.691 --> 00:29:11.451
He's not crying, neither should you.
We'll be in trouble

359
00:29:11.531 --> 00:29:15.291
'cause they're gonna find us,
so please stop crying now.

360
00:29:15.371 --> 00:29:17.771
Good. Good, Sulley. Keep it up.
You're doing great.

361
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:19.731
He's a happy bear.
He has no...

362
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:23.331
- it touched me.
- Sulley, the bear!

363
00:29:23.411 --> 00:29:25.691
The bear. Give her the...

364
00:29:35.771 --> 00:29:37.491
What was that?

365
00:29:37.571 --> 00:29:42.491
<i>I have no idea, but it would be
really great if it didn't do it again.</i>

366
00:30:02.571 --> 00:30:05.011
How could I do this?
How could I be so stupid?

367
00:30:05.091 --> 00:30:08.371
- This could destroy the company.
- Who cares about the company?

368
00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:11.691
What about us?
That thing is a killing machine.

369
00:30:12.851 --> 00:30:15.971
It's waiting for us to fall asleep
and then wham!

370
00:30:16.452 --> 00:30:19.371
We're easy prey, my friend.
We're sitting targets.

371
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:22.171
OK, look, I think I have a plan here.

372
00:30:22.251 --> 00:30:25.372
Using mainly spoons,
we dig a tunnel under the city

373
00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:27.611
and release it into the wild.

374
00:30:27.972 --> 00:30:29.131
Spoons.

375
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:33.371
That's it. I'm out of ideas.
Air balloon, too expensive.

376
00:30:33.452 --> 00:30:37.411
Giant slingshot, too conspicuous.
Enormous wooden horse, too Greek.

377
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:42.811
No. Can't think. Can't think.

378
00:30:43.612 --> 00:30:45.932
- Flatliner. Flatlining.
- Mike?

379
00:30:46.251 --> 00:30:48.291
I think she's getting tired.

380
00:30:48.571 --> 00:30:52.051
Well, then why don't you
find someplace for it to sleep

381
00:30:52.211 --> 00:30:54.251
while I think of a plan!

382
00:30:56.171 --> 00:30:58.891
Are you sleepy? Wanna sleep?

383
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:01.012
Is that what you want?

384
00:31:14.131 --> 00:31:16.932
OK. I'll make a nice little area
for you to...

385
00:31:17.011 --> 00:31:20.851
No. Hey, that's my bed.
You're gonna get your germs all over it.

386
00:31:23.092 --> 00:31:25.731
Fine.
My chair's more comfortable anyway.

387
00:31:27.212 --> 00:31:28.651
What?

388
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:33.291
It's just a closet.
Will you go to sleep?

389
00:31:36.571 --> 00:31:38.292
Hey, that looks like Randall.

390
00:31:39.211 --> 00:31:41.052
Randall's your monster.

391
00:31:41.491 --> 00:31:44.011
You think he's gonna
come through the closet and scare you.

392
00:31:44.092 --> 00:31:45.972
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

393
00:31:46.051 --> 00:31:47.372
It's empty-

394
00:31:47.652 --> 00:31:48.811
See?

395
00:31:49.292 --> 00:31:50.772
No monster in here.

396
00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:55.572
Well, now there is.

397
00:31:55.651 --> 00:31:57.652
But I'm not gonna scare you.

398
00:31:58.371 --> 00:31:59.731
I'm off duty.

399
00:32:03.451 --> 00:32:04.531
OK.

400
00:32:04.892 --> 00:32:08.971
How about I sit here
until you fall asleep?

401
00:32:10.692 --> 00:32:12.691
Go ahead. Go to sleep.

402
00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:16.172
Now. Now go.

403
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:21.331
You go to sleep.

404
00:32:54.091 --> 00:32:57.692
Mike, this might sound crazy,
but I don't think that kid's dangerous.

405
00:32:57.812 --> 00:33:00.251
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

406
00:33:00.332 --> 00:33:02.212
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

407
00:33:02.291 --> 00:33:04.572
What if we just
put her back in her door?

408
00:33:04.651 --> 00:33:06.291
- What?
- Mike, think about it.

409
00:33:06.372 --> 00:33:09.851
We send her back,
everything goes back to normal.

410
00:33:10.091 --> 00:33:12.571
Is that a joke?
Tell me you're joking.

411
00:33:13.092 --> 00:33:15.132
Sulley, I think that given
the circumstance

412
00:33:15.211 --> 00:33:16.932
I've been extremely forgiving till now.

413
00:33:17.012 --> 00:33:18.451
But that is a horrible idea.

414
00:33:18.532 --> 00:33:21.132
Are we gonna march in public
with that thing?

415
00:33:21.412 --> 00:33:23.971
Then I guess we waltz
right up to the factory, right?

416
00:33:25.331 --> 00:33:28.532
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

417
00:33:28.891 --> 00:33:31.732
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights
and some chair fabric

418
00:33:31.812 --> 00:33:34.371
are not gonna fool anyone.
Think about names.

419
00:33:34.452 --> 00:33:36.652
Loch Ness. Bigfoot.
The Abominable Snowman.

420
00:33:36.731 --> 00:33:39.331
They all got one thing in common.
Banishment!

421
00:33:39.412 --> 00:33:41.972
- We could be next.
- Don't panic. We can do this.

422
00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:44.011
- How you doing, Frank?
- Hey, guys.

423
00:33:44.092 --> 00:33:46.412
Everything's going to be OK.

424
00:33:50.971 --> 00:33:52.812
<i>Number one wants this
dusted for prints.</i>

425
00:33:52.891 --> 00:33:55.412
<i>- Careful with that.
- I got a good view.</i>

426
00:33:55.812 --> 00:33:57.212
<i>A little lower.</i>

427
00:33:57.691 --> 00:33:59.452
<i>This was recovered at the scene.</i>

428
00:33:59.532 --> 00:34:01.332
- Don't panic.
- Don't tell me not to.

429
00:34:01.411 --> 00:34:03.012
- Keep it together.
- It's not OK.

430
00:34:03.571 --> 00:34:05.251
<i>- Boo.
- Could be contaminated.</i>

431
00:34:05.332 --> 00:34:07.812
Gentlemen, safety
is our number-one concern.

432
00:34:07.892 --> 00:34:10.692
If there's anything that...
Not now. I'm...

433
00:34:10.772 --> 00:34:12.491
Oh, hello, little one.

434
00:34:12.572 --> 00:34:14.772
- Where did you come from?
- Mr. Waternoose!

435
00:34:14.932 --> 00:34:16.852
James, is this one yours?

436
00:34:16.932 --> 00:34:19.012
Actually, that's my cousin's sister's

437
00:34:19.091 --> 00:34:21.131
- daughter, sir.
- Yeah, it's...

438
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:24.212
Bring an Obscure Relative
to Work Day.

439
00:34:24.932 --> 00:34:27.451
Must have missed the memo.
Well, listen, James,

440
00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.771
why don't you stop by the simulator
after lunch

441
00:34:29.852 --> 00:34:32.452
and give us that scare demonstration?

442
00:34:32.531 --> 00:34:34.212
Yeah. Oh, sir...

443
00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:36.572
- Mr. Waternoose?
- Yes, yes. I'm coming.

444
00:34:36.972 --> 00:34:38.932
I'll see you this afternoon, James.

445
00:34:39.052 --> 00:34:42.012
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

446
00:34:42.092 --> 00:34:43.771
- Oh, boy.
- A scare demo.

447
00:34:43.852 --> 00:34:45.612
That is great.
Why am I the last to know?

448
00:34:45.691 --> 00:34:49.092
We could bring your cousin's sister's
daughter. She'll be a big hit.

449
00:34:49.972 --> 00:34:51.212
<i>Halt.</i>

450
00:34:52.652 --> 00:34:54.012
<i>Hold him down.</i>

451
00:34:57.891 --> 00:34:59.332
Come on. The coast is clear.

452
00:34:59.732 --> 00:35:01.852
OK. All we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

453
00:35:01.932 --> 00:35:03.732
So wait here while I get its card.

454
00:35:03.812 --> 00:35:06.652
She can't stay here.
This is the men's room.

455
00:35:07.412 --> 00:35:09.292
That is the weirdest thing
you've ever said.

456
00:35:09.971 --> 00:35:12.851
Look. it loves it here.
It's dancing with joy.

457
00:35:13.772 --> 00:35:16.131
I'll be right back with its door key.

458
00:35:17.771 --> 00:35:21.331
That's a cute little dance.
It almost looks like you've got to...

459
00:35:35.731 --> 00:35:37.332
Are you done in there?

460
00:35:39.492 --> 00:35:41.052
SorFY, Sorry-

461
00:35:53.452 --> 00:35:55.572
OK. You're finished now, right?

462
00:35:56.012 --> 00:35:57.212
Hello?

463
00:36:00.932 --> 00:36:02.012
Boo.

464
00:36:12.172 --> 00:36:13.572
Where did she go?

465
00:36:14.852 --> 00:36:16.332
Did she disappear?

466
00:36:16.652 --> 00:36:18.972
Did she turn invisible?

467
00:36:19.692 --> 00:36:21.932
I just have no idea.

468
00:36:22.892 --> 00:36:24.172
Gotcha.

469
00:36:25.292 --> 00:36:26.292
Boo.

470
00:36:28.972 --> 00:36:30.772
Hey, You're good.

471
00:36:36.572 --> 00:36:38.972
Be relaxed. Be relaxed. Be relaxed.

472
00:36:39.532 --> 00:36:42.972
Roz, my tender oozing blossom.
You're looking fabulous today.

473
00:36:43.052 --> 00:36:46.172
Is that a new haircut?
Tell me, it's a new haircut.

474
00:36:47.132 --> 00:36:49.732
New makeup. You had a lift.
You had a tuck. You had something.

475
00:36:49.812 --> 00:36:53.812
Something has been inserted in
your skin that makes you look like...

476
00:36:55.172 --> 00:36:59.012
I need a favor. Randall was working
late last night on the scare floor.

477
00:36:59.092 --> 00:37:01.732
I need the key
for the door he was using.

478
00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:04.572
Well, isn't that nice?

479
00:37:04.652 --> 00:37:08.412
But guess what? You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

480
00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.412
He didn't... No paperwork?

481
00:37:10.492 --> 00:37:13.132
This office is now closed.

482
00:37:15.452 --> 00:37:17.692
Ready or not, here I come.

483
00:37:17.772 --> 00:37:19.052
I'm getting warmer.

484
00:37:19.133 --> 00:37:20.732
Any second now.

485
00:37:20.812 --> 00:37:24.492
- Fee, fi, f0...
- What are you doing?

486
00:37:25.212 --> 00:37:26.572
I'm looking for the kid.

487
00:37:26.652 --> 00:37:29.172
- You lost it?
- No, no. She was just...

488
00:37:30.732 --> 00:37:31.932
Here she is.

489
00:37:32.012 --> 00:37:33.533
Hey. What's the matter?

490
00:37:33.612 --> 00:37:36.652
<i>- I already told your buddies...
- All right. Carry on.</i>

491
00:37:48.692 --> 00:37:52.292
Randall. Thank goodness.
What are we gonna do about the child?

492
00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:15.493
It's on the front page.
The child. The one you were after.

493
00:38:15.572 --> 00:38:18.812
Be quiet. Don't you think
I'm aware of the situation?

494
00:38:18.892 --> 00:38:20.892
I was up all night trying to find it.

495
00:38:20.973 --> 00:38:24.892
I did a calculation factoring in
the size of the sushi restaurant.

496
00:38:24.972 --> 00:38:26.492
The child may have escaped!

497
00:38:26.572 --> 00:38:29.292
Until we know for sure
we're gonna act like nothing happened.

498
00:38:29.932 --> 00:38:31.133
Get the machine running.
I'll take care of the kid.

499
00:38:32.852 --> 00:38:35.773
When I find whoever let it out,
they're dead.

500
00:38:38.052 --> 00:38:41.172
Why are you still here?
Come on, go! Move! Now!

501
00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:42.412
I'm not here.

502
00:38:43.292 --> 00:38:44.573
They're gone.

503
00:38:49.412 --> 00:38:51.013
This is bad, so very bad.

504
00:38:51.092 --> 00:38:52.373
What were they talking about,
machine?

505
00:38:52.452 --> 00:38:53.812
Who cares?

506
00:38:54.892 --> 00:38:57.092
All we have to do
is call her door and send her home.

507
00:38:57.173 --> 00:38:59.773
Right. We're just two regular Joes
on our way to work.

508
00:38:59.852 --> 00:39:01.612
We will blend right in.

509
00:39:01.812 --> 00:39:04.173
- Top of the morning.
- What's shakin', bacon?

510
00:39:04.252 --> 00:39:06.532
Did you lose weight?
Or a limb?

511
00:39:06.692 --> 00:39:08.852
- You have her card key, right?
- Of course.

512
00:39:08.932 --> 00:39:11.532
I told you I'd get her card key.
I went and got it.

513
00:39:11.612 --> 00:39:13.493
Now I have her card key.

514
00:39:14.573 --> 00:39:15.852
OK. Here we go.

515
00:39:16.812 --> 00:39:20.333
Take care of yourself. Try not to
run through any more closets.

516
00:39:23.812 --> 00:39:26.653
- Mike, that's not her door.
- Of course it's her door.

517
00:39:26.732 --> 00:39:29.133
No. Her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

518
00:39:29.212 --> 00:39:32.652
It must have been dark last night
because this is its door.

519
00:39:33.292 --> 00:39:35.853
Hey, you hear that?
Sounds like fun in there.

520
00:39:35.932 --> 00:39:38.892
Send me a postcard, kid.
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

521
00:39:38.972 --> 00:39:41.613
22 Mike Wazowski,
you-got-your-life-back Lane.

522
00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.613
Very good. Now bon voyage.

523
00:39:44.692 --> 00:39:48.212
Bye-bye. Look at the stick.
See the stick? Go get the stick.

524
00:39:48.492 --> 00:39:51.532
- Go fetch.
- Mike, this isn't Boo's door.

525
00:39:51.812 --> 00:39:55.092
- Boo? What's Boo?
- That's what I decided to call her.

526
00:39:55.212 --> 00:39:56.172
There a problem?

527
00:39:56.253 --> 00:39:57.653
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.

528
00:39:57.732 --> 00:40:00.413
Once you name it,
you start getting attached to it.

529
00:40:00.492 --> 00:40:04.012
Now put that thing back
where it came from, or so help me...

530
00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:12.132
Hey. We're rehearsing a scene for
the upcoming company play called...

531
00:40:12.333 --> 00:40:15.252
Put That Thing Back
Where it Came From or So Help Me.

532
00:40:15.812 --> 00:40:17.052
It's a musical.

533
00:40:17.133 --> 00:40:19.613
<i>Put that thing back
where it came from or so help me</i>

534
00:40:19.693 --> 00:40:20.852
<i>So help me, so help me</i>

535
00:40:20.933 --> 00:40:21.972
And cut.

536
00:40:22.613 --> 00:40:26.053
We're still working on it.
It's in progress, but we need ushers.

537
00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:29.932
Sulley, I've had enough.
Say goodbye to... Where did it go?

538
00:40:30.052 --> 00:40:32.412
- Where is she?
- She got away from you again?

539
00:40:32.493 --> 00:40:36.812
Well, that is just...
Wait a minute. The sun is coming up.

540
00:40:36.893 --> 00:40:38.452
This is perfect.

541
00:40:38.533 --> 00:40:39.853
She's gone!

542
00:40:41.012 --> 00:40:42.692
Where are you going?
Sulley, don't blow this.

543
00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:44.492
We're so close to breaking the record.

544
00:40:44.573 --> 00:40:47.133
Somebody will find the kid.
It'll be their problem.

545
00:40:47.212 --> 00:40:49.292
She's out of our hair!

546
00:40:50.133 --> 00:40:53.053
- What are you two doing?
- They're rehearsing a play.

547
00:40:53.132 --> 00:40:55.613
<i>She's out of our hair</i>

548
00:40:55.692 --> 00:40:59.453
Can it! So, what do you think
of that kid getting out, Sullivan?

549
00:40:59.532 --> 00:41:01.653
- Pretty crazy?
- Oh, yeah, crazy.

550
00:41:01.732 --> 00:41:04.253
Word is the kid's been traced
to this factory.

551
00:41:04.332 --> 00:41:06.812
- You haven't seen anything?
- Well...

552
00:41:07.053 --> 00:41:08.732
No. No way.

553
00:41:08.813 --> 00:41:12.852
But if it was an inside job,
I'd put my money on Waxford.

554
00:41:12.933 --> 00:41:14.813
- Waxford?
- The one at station six.

555
00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:17.613
- He's got them shifty eyes.
- Hey, Waxford.

556
00:41:17.932 --> 00:41:20.453
- Sulley!
- Michael Wazowski!

557
00:41:22.973 --> 00:41:27.372
Last night was one of the worst nights
of my entire life, bar none!

558
00:41:29.052 --> 00:41:31.973
- I thought you cared about me.
- Honey, please.

559
00:41:32.052 --> 00:41:35.092
- I thought you liked sushi.
- Sushi! Sushi!

560
00:41:35.173 --> 00:41:37.812
You think this is about sushi?

561
00:41:43.213 --> 00:41:44.252
Wazowski.

562
00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:45.772
Michael!

563
00:41:45.853 --> 00:41:46.813
Men.

564
00:41:48.453 --> 00:41:50.012
Breathe. Keep breathing.

565
00:42:01.293 --> 00:42:02.973
- Where's the kid?
- Kid?

566
00:42:03.052 --> 00:42:06.093
- What kid?
- It's here in the factory, isn't it?

567
00:42:07.533 --> 00:42:10.133
It never would have gotten out
if you hadn't been cheating last night.

568
00:42:10.773 --> 00:42:14.093
Cheating? Cheating. Right.

569
00:42:14.453 --> 00:42:17.452
OK. I think I know
how to make this all go away.

570
00:42:17.933 --> 00:42:21.733
What happens when the whistle blows
in five minutes?

571
00:42:22.493 --> 00:42:25.773
- I get a timeout?
- Everyone goes to lunch.

572
00:42:26.492 --> 00:42:30.013
Which means the scare floor will be...

573
00:42:31.533 --> 00:42:33.212
- Painted?
- Empty.

574
00:42:33.293 --> 00:42:35.373
It'll be empty, you idiot.

575
00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:36.933
You see that clock?

576
00:42:37.013 --> 00:42:41.172
When the big hand is pointing up
and the little hand is pointing up,

577
00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:43.613
the kid's door will be in my station.

578
00:42:43.733 --> 00:42:46.573
But when the big hand points down,

579
00:42:47.093 --> 00:42:48.613
the door will be gone.

580
00:42:49.093 --> 00:42:51.653
You have until then to put the kid back.

581
00:42:52.333 --> 00:42:53.893
Get the picture?

582
00:43:04.612 --> 00:43:05.693
Boo!

583
00:43:06.413 --> 00:43:08.613
<i>- No.
- Hey, you. Halt.</i>

584
00:43:08.973 --> 00:43:10.092
<i>He's the one.</i>

585
00:43:10.173 --> 00:43:12.572
<i>- The one from the commercial.
- That's him.</i>

586
00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:15.973
<i>- Can we get an autograph?
- Oh, sure. No problem.</i>

587
00:43:16.053 --> 00:43:18.332
<i>Make that out to Stephanie,
my daughter.</i>

588
00:43:18.413 --> 00:43:19.533
Yes. Let's see.

589
00:43:20.053 --> 00:43:22.973
"From your scary friend.
Best wishes..

590
00:43:23.053 --> 00:43:27.053
So, then I said, "if you talk to me
like that again, we're through".

591
00:43:27.533 --> 00:43:29.853
- What'd she say?
- You know my mom.

592
00:43:29.933 --> 00:43:32.653
- She sent me to my room.
- See you guys later. Take it easy.

593
00:43:32.733 --> 00:43:34.013
Bottoms up.

594
00:43:50.733 --> 00:43:51.813
Boo!

595
00:43:56.493 --> 00:43:57.693
Hi.

596
00:43:59.493 --> 00:44:01.933
Well, hello, there.
What's your name?

597
00:44:02.213 --> 00:44:03.773
Mike Wazowski.

598
00:44:41.013 --> 00:44:42.613
Sulley!

599
00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:44.613
Oh, Sulley.

600
00:44:45.813 --> 00:44:47.373
OK, Sulley, come on.

601
00:44:48.173 --> 00:44:50.133
Hey! You guys seen Sulley anywhere?

602
00:44:50.213 --> 00:44:52.373
'N009, sorry_
- Sulley!

603
00:44:52.453 --> 00:44:55.053
Boy, Wazowski
looks like he's in trouble.

604
00:44:56.453 --> 00:44:59.133
2319! We have a 2319!

605
00:44:59.213 --> 00:45:01.333
Oh, dear.

606
00:45:02.093 --> 00:45:03.173
Sulley!

607
00:45:03.413 --> 00:45:04.493
Sulley!

608
00:45:07.653 --> 00:45:10.013
Sulley. Great news, pal.

609
00:45:10.093 --> 00:45:12.453
I got us a way out of this mess,
but we gotta hurry.

610
00:45:12.533 --> 00:45:13.933
Where is it?

611
00:45:15.693 --> 00:45:17.853
Sull, that's a cube of garbage.

612
00:45:20.253 --> 00:45:23.053
I can still hear her little voice.

613
00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:25.373
- Mike Wazowski.
- I can hear it too.

614
00:45:25.453 --> 00:45:28.093
- Mike Wazowski!
- How many kids you got in there?

615
00:45:28.173 --> 00:45:29.694
Mike Wazowski!

616
00:45:31.173 --> 00:45:32.773
"Kitty!
'B00!

617
00:45:34.613 --> 00:45:37.774
Boo, you're all right.
I was so worried. I was...

618
00:45:38.533 --> 00:45:41.614
Don't you ever
run away from me again, young lady.

619
00:45:42.413 --> 00:45:44.973
But I'm so glad you're safe.

620
00:45:45.373 --> 00:45:48.053
My, what an affectionate father.

621
00:45:48.173 --> 00:45:50.893
Actually, she's my cousin's sister's...

622
00:45:51.173 --> 00:45:53.373
- That's enough. Let's go.
- Mike Wazowski.

623
00:45:53.453 --> 00:45:55.853
Yeah. Step aside, kid.
We're in a...

624
00:46:02.613 --> 00:46:05.894
- Will you stop making Boo laugh?
- I didn't. Come on.

625
00:46:09.293 --> 00:46:11.733
I still don't understand.
You got Boo's door?

626
00:46:11.813 --> 00:46:13.893
I'll explain later. Run.

627
00:46:13.974 --> 00:46:17.573
Let's move, let's move. Come on.
Please be there. Please be there.

628
00:46:17.814 --> 00:46:20.574
- There it is, just like Randall said.
- Randall?

629
00:46:20.694 --> 00:46:22.973
Wait a minute. Boo, hey.

630
00:46:23.053 --> 00:46:25.693
One, two, three, four,
get the kid through the door.

631
00:46:26.253 --> 00:46:29.693
- The nightmare is over.
- It's OK, Boo. What's the matter?

632
00:46:29.773 --> 00:46:32.133
- It's time to move.
- Mike, what are you thinking?

633
00:46:32.214 --> 00:46:34.814
- Randall's after Boo.
- Who cares? Let's go.

634
00:46:34.893 --> 00:46:37.773
- This is a limited-time offer.
- No. I don't like this.

635
00:46:37.854 --> 00:46:40.333
Sulley, you wanted her door
and there it is.

636
00:46:40.413 --> 00:46:42.813
- Now let's move.
- No, Mike.

637
00:46:43.493 --> 00:46:45.534
You want me to prove
everything's on the up and up?

638
00:46:45.613 --> 00:46:47.493
- He wants a door, I get a door.
- Wait.

639
00:46:47.574 --> 00:46:49.573
Paranoid delusional furball.

640
00:46:51.694 --> 00:46:52.893
Mike!

641
00:47:49.294 --> 00:47:51.614
Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?

642
00:47:51.693 --> 00:47:53.613
Sulley? Sulley!

643
00:48:09.493 --> 00:48:11.173
Mike? Mike?

644
00:48:12.054 --> 00:48:13.294
Where are you?

645
00:48:13.653 --> 00:48:14.934
Are you in there?

646
00:48:15.533 --> 00:48:16.974
Where are you, buddy?

647
00:48:17.493 --> 00:48:18.693
Mike?

648
00:48:19.213 --> 00:48:20.654
Where are you?

649
00:48:30.414 --> 00:48:31.973
Boo, way to go.

650
00:48:39.533 --> 00:48:40.933
It's OK.

651
00:48:58.293 --> 00:49:00.813
Randall, did you have to...

652
00:49:09.453 --> 00:49:12.614
- Yes! I got the kid.
- Oh, huzzah!

653
00:49:12.693 --> 00:49:16.494
- Great news. Not that I was concerned.
- Get over here and help me.

654
00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:19.534
Come on, while we're young here,
Fungus.

655
00:49:23.454 --> 00:49:25.934
The kid needs to take off a few pounds.

656
00:49:30.094 --> 00:49:33.054
Wazowski! Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

657
00:49:33.133 --> 00:49:36.013
It's cretin. If you're gonna
threaten me, do it properly.

658
00:49:36.094 --> 00:49:38.174
Second, you're nuts if you think
kidnapping me

659
00:49:38.254 --> 00:49:40.013
is gonna help you cheat!

660
00:49:42.493 --> 00:49:45.574
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

661
00:49:45.654 --> 00:49:47.174
Well, I did.

662
00:49:47.253 --> 00:49:51.894
Right up until you chuckled like that.
Now I think I should get out of here.

663
00:49:52.574 --> 00:49:55.574
I'm about to revolutionize
the scaring industry.

664
00:49:55.653 --> 00:49:58.494
When I do,
even the great James P. Sullivan

665
00:49:58.574 --> 00:50:00.254
is gonna be working for me.

666
00:50:00.334 --> 00:50:03.294
Well, somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

667
00:50:03.374 --> 00:50:06.654
First I need to know where the kid is
and you're gonna tell me.

668
00:50:06.733 --> 00:50:08.454
- I don't know.
- Sure.

669
00:50:08.533 --> 00:50:10.534
I don't. I don't.

670
00:50:12.854 --> 00:50:15.614
What's that? Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

671
00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:18.253
Come on. No, no.
Come on. Hey, hey.

672
00:50:18.334 --> 00:50:20.214
Hey, hey. This thing is moving.

673
00:50:21.774 --> 00:50:24.973
I don't like big moving things
that are moving towards me.

674
00:50:25.253 --> 00:50:26.613
No. Come on. Hey!

675
00:50:26.893 --> 00:50:31.374
- Randall!
- Say hello to the scream extractor.

676
00:50:32.054 --> 00:50:33.134
Hello.

677
00:50:33.374 --> 00:50:36.334
Where you going?
We'll talk. We'll have a latte.

678
00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:39.214
Come on. We can talk about this.

679
00:50:43.213 --> 00:50:44.814
What is that thing?

680
00:50:45.214 --> 00:50:47.414
Wait, wait, wait.
No,no,no.

681
00:50:47.494 --> 00:50:49.214
No. Come on.

682
00:50:50.734 --> 00:50:53.373
Help. Help! Help, help!

683
00:51:00.294 --> 00:51:02.374
For... What did you do wrong this time?

684
00:51:02.454 --> 00:51:05.614
- I don't know. I calibrated the...
- Go check the machine.

685
00:51:05.694 --> 00:51:08.414
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

686
00:51:28.174 --> 00:51:31.213
Fungus? Fungus? You like cars?

687
00:51:31.694 --> 00:51:35.854
I got a really nice car. If you
let me go, I'll give you a ride

688
00:51:35.934 --> 00:51:38.214
in the car.
Please, Fungus.

689
00:51:38.294 --> 00:51:41.214
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said I'm not allowed

690
00:51:41.294 --> 00:51:44.094
to fraternize with victims
of his evil plot.

691
00:51:55.854 --> 00:51:58.214
What happened?
Where's Wazowski?

692
00:52:01.294 --> 00:52:02.894
Where is he?

693
00:52:08.454 --> 00:52:11.014
- Come on.
- This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.

694
00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:12.734
<i>That could be contaminated.</i>

695
00:52:12.814 --> 00:52:14.654
We gotta get out of here now!

696
00:52:14.734 --> 00:52:18.174
We could start a new life far away.
Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.

697
00:52:18.254 --> 00:52:20.174
Good bye, Mr. VVate moose.

698
00:52:20.254 --> 00:52:22.654
- No, Mike, wait.
- Hey, what are you doing?

699
00:52:22.734 --> 00:52:26.654
- Follow me. I have an idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

700
00:52:27.214 --> 00:52:30.334
<i>- Simulation terminated.
- No, no, no, no, no.</i>

701
00:52:30.414 --> 00:52:34.214
What was that? You're trying
to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.

702
00:52:34.294 --> 00:52:37.054
I was going for a snake/ninja approach

703
00:52:37.134 --> 00:52:39.014
with a little hissing.

704
00:52:39.934 --> 00:52:43.574
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's all about presence.

705
00:52:43.654 --> 00:52:46.854
- About how you enter the room.
- Mr. Waternoose!

706
00:52:46.934 --> 00:52:48.734
James, perfect timing.

707
00:52:48.814 --> 00:52:50.654
No, no, sir. You don't understand.

708
00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:53.254
- Show these monsters how it's done.
- I can't.

709
00:52:53.334 --> 00:52:55.894
- Sir, you have to listen to me.
- Pay attention.

710
00:52:55.974 --> 00:52:58.374
You're about to see
the best in the business.

711
00:52:58.454 --> 00:53:01.054
- Reset the simulator.
- But sir!

712
00:53:01.134 --> 00:53:02.934
- Good night, sweetheart.
- 'Night, Mom.

713
00:53:03.294 --> 00:53:04.894
- Kitty!
- No, Boo, no!

714
00:53:04.974 --> 00:53:08.494
- Give us a big loud roar.
- There's no time for this!

715
00:53:08.575 --> 00:53:11.214
- What are you waiting for? Roar.
- But, sir...

716
00:53:11.294 --> 00:53:12.774
Roar!

717
00:53:23.054 --> 00:53:25.974
Well done. Well done, James.

718
00:53:26.255 --> 00:53:27.454
- Boo?
- All right, gentlemen.

719
00:53:27.534 --> 00:53:30.734
- Right this way.
- I hope you've learned a lesson today.

720
00:53:35.054 --> 00:53:36.174
Boo.

721
00:53:40.374 --> 00:53:41.615
Boo.

722
00:53:46.254 --> 00:53:48.254
Boo, it's me.

723
00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:53.214
- The child!
- Sir, she isn't toxic.

724
00:53:53.294 --> 00:53:55.814
- It sounds crazy, but trust me.
- Boo?

725
00:53:56.295 --> 00:53:57.935
No, no, no, no, it's OK.

726
00:53:58.014 --> 00:53:59.575
I was just... No.

727
00:53:59.654 --> 00:54:03.534
No, don't be scared.
That wasn't real.

728
00:54:03.614 --> 00:54:06.414
It's just a... I was just...

729
00:54:19.534 --> 00:54:22.734
- Boo.
- ...test it out on that sweet girl.

730
00:54:23.374 --> 00:54:25.734
- Boo.
- ...have her, he is trying to kill us.

731
00:54:25.854 --> 00:54:27.815
- This is Randall's fault.
- Randall?

732
00:54:27.894 --> 00:54:31.294
We can take you to his secret lab
in this factory.

733
00:54:31.374 --> 00:54:35.054
How could this happen?
How could this happen?

734
00:54:36.055 --> 00:54:38.095
Does anyone else know about this?

735
00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:39.534
- No, sir.
- Good.

736
00:54:39.974 --> 00:54:43.055
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

737
00:54:43.374 --> 00:54:45.734
Now, before we do anything else,

738
00:54:45.814 --> 00:54:48.815
let's take care of the child.

739
00:54:52.974 --> 00:54:55.255
I never thought
things would come to this.

740
00:54:55.655 --> 00:54:57.295
Not in my factory.

741
00:54:58.654 --> 00:55:01.534
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this.

742
00:55:01.614 --> 00:55:03.414
Especially you, James.

743
00:55:03.495 --> 00:55:06.375
But now we can
set everything straight again.

744
00:55:06.854 --> 00:55:07.934
For the good of the company.

745
00:55:12.255 --> 00:55:14.015
Sir? That's not her door.

746
00:55:14.094 --> 00:55:15.854
I know, I know.

747
00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.254
It's yours.

748
00:55:24.455 --> 00:55:25.535
No!

749
00:55:27.814 --> 00:55:29.695
Boo!

750
00:55:35.135 --> 00:55:39.174
No! No! No, no, no, no!

751
00:55:40.615 --> 00:55:43.095
It's too late.
We're banished, genius!

752
00:55:43.174 --> 00:55:45.055
We're in the human world.

753
00:55:45.134 --> 00:55:48.214
What a great idea,
going to your old pal Waternoose.

754
00:55:48.335 --> 00:55:50.495
Too bad he was in on the whole thing.

755
00:55:50.574 --> 00:55:52.894
All you had to do was listen to me.

756
00:55:52.975 --> 00:55:56.975
Just once!
But you didn't, did you?

757
00:55:57.095 --> 00:55:59.295
You're still not listening!

758
00:56:05.855 --> 00:56:07.215
Take that!

759
00:56:12.534 --> 00:56:15.014
Welcome to the Himalayas.

760
00:56:18.134 --> 00:56:20.975
Abominable. Can you believe that?

761
00:56:21.054 --> 00:56:22.814
Do I look abominable to you?

762
00:56:22.974 --> 00:56:25.095
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman

763
00:56:25.175 --> 00:56:28.095
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

764
00:56:28.294 --> 00:56:30.815
I'm a nice guy.
Snow cone?

765
00:56:31.734 --> 00:56:34.294
No, don't worry. It's lemon.

766
00:56:35.174 --> 00:56:37.614
How about you, big fella?
Snow cone?

767
00:56:40.175 --> 00:56:42.854
Did you see the way she looked at me?

768
00:56:45.734 --> 00:56:49.175
Poor guy. I understand.
It ain't easy being banished.

769
00:56:49.455 --> 00:56:50.815
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

770
00:56:50.894 --> 00:56:54.975
When he was banished, he fashioned
an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.

771
00:56:55.215 --> 00:56:56.974
Wore it on his head like a tiara.

772
00:56:57.055 --> 00:57:00.774
Called himself King Itchy.
It won't be so hard for you guys.

773
00:57:00.895 --> 00:57:02.215
How lucky can you get?

774
00:57:02.294 --> 00:57:05.574
- Banished with your best friend.
- He is not my friend.

775
00:57:05.775 --> 00:57:09.414
I just assumed you were buddies.
When I saw you in the snow hugging...

776
00:57:09.495 --> 00:57:12.415
Look at that big jerk.
Ruined my life. And for what?

777
00:57:12.495 --> 00:57:13.694
A stupid kid!

778
00:57:13.775 --> 00:57:16.895
Because of you I am now stuck
in this frozen wasteland.

779
00:57:16.974 --> 00:57:20.134
Wasteland?
I think you mean wonderland.

780
00:57:20.215 --> 00:57:22.574
How about all this fabulous snow?

781
00:57:23.055 --> 00:57:25.174
And wait till you see
the local village.

782
00:57:25.255 --> 00:57:29.054
Cutest thing in the world.
I haven't mentioned the free yaks' milk.

783
00:57:29.695 --> 00:57:31.615
- What did you say?
- Yaks' milk.

784
00:57:31.695 --> 00:57:33.694
Milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic.

785
00:57:33.775 --> 00:57:36.095
Once you pick the hairs out
it's nutritious.

786
00:57:36.174 --> 00:57:38.494
No, about a village.
Are there kids in it?

787
00:57:38.575 --> 00:57:41.695
Kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks.

788
00:57:41.774 --> 00:57:44.134
- Where is it?
- At the bottom of the mountain.

789
00:57:44.215 --> 00:57:46.895
- A three-day hike.
- Three days?

790
00:57:46.975 --> 00:57:48.895
We need to get there now.

791
00:57:58.895 --> 00:58:00.615
You wanna go to the village?

792
00:58:00.694 --> 00:58:04.655
Rule number one out here,
always... No.

793
00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:07.135
Never go out in a blizzard.

794
00:58:07.255 --> 00:58:09.455
We need to get to Boo.

795
00:58:11.534 --> 00:58:13.415
Boo? What about us?

796
00:58:14.455 --> 00:58:17.294
Ever since the kid came in,
you've ignored everything I've said,

797
00:58:17.375 --> 00:58:22.335
and now look where we are!
We were about to break the record.

798
00:58:22.415 --> 00:58:25.735
- We would have had it made.
- None of that matters now.

799
00:58:26.415 --> 00:58:28.655
None of it matters?
Wait a second.

800
00:58:28.895 --> 00:58:30.815
None of it matters?

801
00:58:33.095 --> 00:58:35.534
OK. No, good. Great.

802
00:58:36.255 --> 00:58:38.615
So now the truth comes out, doesn't it?

803
00:58:40.175 --> 00:58:43.335
Would you look at that?
We're out of snow cones.

804
00:58:43.415 --> 00:58:46.094
Let me just go outside
and make some more.

805
00:58:47.455 --> 00:58:50.415
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

806
00:58:51.255 --> 00:58:52.935
Does that matter?

807
00:58:54.255 --> 00:58:55.694
What about Celia?

808
00:58:55.815 --> 00:58:58.895
I am never...
Never gonna see her again.

809
00:58:59.814 --> 00:59:01.535
Doesn't that matter?

810
00:59:06.455 --> 00:59:07.815
And what about me?

811
00:59:08.655 --> 00:59:11.054
I'm your pal. I'm your best friend.

812
00:59:12.175 --> 00:59:13.654
Don't I matter?

813
00:59:16.695 --> 00:59:18.255
I'm sorry, Mike.

814
00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:20.335
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

815
00:59:20.815 --> 00:59:22.775
I didn't mean for this to happen.

816
00:59:23.135 --> 00:59:24.935
But Boo's in trouble.

817
00:59:25.095 --> 00:59:28.054
I think there might be
a way to save her if we can just get...

818
00:59:28.135 --> 00:59:30.535
We? Whoa. We?

819
00:59:30.735 --> 00:59:34.015
No. There's no "we" this time, pal.

820
00:59:34.375 --> 00:59:37.654
If you want to go out there
and freeze to death,

821
00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:39.695
you be my guest.

822
00:59:40.655 --> 00:59:42.695
Because you're on your own.

823
01:00:18.255 --> 01:00:20.335
Hey, I got more snow cones!

824
01:01:05.615 --> 01:01:08.576
Come on, George.
I know you can do this.

825
01:01:08.655 --> 01:01:10.735
I picked out an easy door for you.

826
01:01:10.896 --> 01:01:13.855
In Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal.

827
01:01:13.935 --> 01:01:16.895
You know, you're right.
Here. Take this.

828
01:01:16.975 --> 01:01:18.695
Go get 'em, Georgie.

829
01:01:18.815 --> 01:01:20.215
Look out. Coming through.

830
01:01:20.295 --> 01:01:22.935
- Sorry, George.
- Hey, you can't just...

831
01:01:23.735 --> 01:01:25.215
Twenty-three...

832
01:01:30.415 --> 01:01:32.016
Out of the way!

833
01:01:37.135 --> 01:01:40.095
Finally. I never should have
trusted you with this.

834
01:01:40.175 --> 01:01:43.055
Because of you,
I had to banish my top scarer.

835
01:01:43.136 --> 01:01:45.215
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

836
01:01:45.295 --> 01:01:47.376
Sullivan got what he deserved.

837
01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:50.415
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be.

838
01:02:03.775 --> 01:02:05.015
Kitty!

839
01:02:11.656 --> 01:02:13.335
- Kitty!
- Sullivan?

840
01:02:19.415 --> 01:02:21.455
- Kitty!
- Sorry, Boo.

841
01:02:21.656 --> 01:02:23.215
Stop him!

842
01:02:23.815 --> 01:02:25.455
Let's get you home.

843
01:02:28.936 --> 01:02:30.255
Finish him off!

844
01:02:37.535 --> 01:02:41.215
You don't know how long
I've wanted to do that, Sullivan.

845
01:02:53.255 --> 01:02:54.255
Mike?

846
01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:56.735
- It's not that I don't care.
- Mike, you don't understand.

847
01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:58.855
Yes, I do.
I was just mad, that's all.

848
01:02:58.936 --> 01:03:03.095
I needed some time to think, but
you shouldn't have left me out there.

849
01:03:03.695 --> 01:03:06.015
- I'm being attacked.
- I'm not attacking you.

850
01:03:06.096 --> 01:03:09.455
I'm trying to be honest. Hear me out.
You and I are a team.

851
01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:11.976
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

852
01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:14.095
I know. He's too sensitive.

853
01:03:16.415 --> 01:03:19.175
Come on, pal.
If you start crying, I'm gonna cry.

854
01:03:19.256 --> 01:03:21.335
And I'll never get through this.

855
01:03:21.416 --> 01:03:24.336
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you,
but I am now.

856
01:03:24.415 --> 01:03:28.655
Sulley, I am baring my soul here.
The least you can do is pay attention.

857
01:03:32.655 --> 01:03:34.655
Look at that. It's Randall.

858
01:03:36.175 --> 01:03:37.336
Come on.

859
01:03:37.935 --> 01:03:40.455
Get up. There can't be any witnesses.

860
01:03:40.535 --> 01:03:41.535
There won't be.

861
01:03:42.136 --> 01:03:43.735
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

862
01:03:43.816 --> 01:03:46.936
Somebody's gotta take care of you,
you big hairball.

863
01:03:50.135 --> 01:03:52.416
- Schmoopsie-pooh, I can't talk.
- Come on.

864
01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:56.816
Michael, if you don't tell me what's
going on right now, we are through!

865
01:03:57.295 --> 01:03:58.296
Here's the truth.

866
01:03:58.375 --> 01:04:02.456
The kid? Sulley let her in. We tried to
send her back, Waternoose had a plot,

867
01:04:02.535 --> 01:04:04.815
and now Randall's trying to kill us!

868
01:04:04.896 --> 01:04:08.135
You expect me to believe
that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?

869
01:04:08.216 --> 01:04:09.736
Mike Wazowski.

870
01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:12.576
I love you, schmoopsie-pooh!

871
01:04:12.655 --> 01:04:15.616
- Hey!
- Idiots.

872
01:04:16.576 --> 01:04:18.176
Look out. Coming through.

873
01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:20.895
Make way. Move it.
Hurry up, hurry up.

874
01:04:22.415 --> 01:04:24.776
<i>- There they are.
- Attention, employees.</i>

875
01:04:24.855 --> 01:04:28.656
<i>Randall Boggs has just broken
the all-time scare record.</i>

876
01:04:29.296 --> 01:04:31.695
No, I didn't.
Get out of my way.

877
01:04:32.295 --> 01:04:34.096
Go get 'em, googly bear.

878
01:04:35.535 --> 01:04:36.576
There it is.

879
01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:39.255
Get off my tail. Let go.

880
01:04:42.896 --> 01:04:44.335
- What are you doing?
- Grab on, Mike.

881
01:04:44.416 --> 01:04:47.256
Are you out of your mind?

882
01:04:56.736 --> 01:04:59.776
- Sulley, what are we doing?
- Get Boo's door and find a station.

883
01:04:59.856 --> 01:05:02.256
What a plan.
Simple, yet insane.

884
01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:17.016
- Whoa.
- Oh, boy.

885
01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:19.056
Hold on!

886
01:05:27.416 --> 01:05:28.976
Don't look down!

887
01:05:44.176 --> 01:05:45.856
I'm gonna be sick.

888
01:05:49.896 --> 01:05:51.136
Oh, no.

889
01:05:54.935 --> 01:05:56.136
No!

890
01:05:57.456 --> 01:05:59.456
- Boo's door.
- There it is.

891
01:05:59.656 --> 01:06:02.136
How are we supposed to get to it now?

892
01:06:05.296 --> 01:06:06.856
It's a dead end, Sulley.

893
01:06:08.496 --> 01:06:09.936
- There he is.
- Make her laugh.

894
01:06:10.016 --> 01:06:11.696
- Sulley!
- Just do it!

895
01:06:20.896 --> 01:06:22.976
- Get it open.
- Here he comes.

896
01:06:23.055 --> 01:06:24.656
Give me that kid.

897
01:06:29.495 --> 01:06:33.296
- Why couldn't we get banished here?
- We gotta find another door.

898
01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:40.136
Look! Boo's door.

899
01:06:44.576 --> 01:06:47.296
- There he is. Hurry up!
- Give me your hand.

900
01:06:53.936 --> 01:06:56.456
- Come on, it slides.
- Right. Right.

901
01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.936
Jump. I'm right behind you.

902
01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:07.816
Come on.

903
01:07:09.696 --> 01:07:11.096
Hurry up. Keep moving!

904
01:07:11.176 --> 01:07:12.816
Get inside.

905
01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.256
That was weird.

906
01:07:15.736 --> 01:07:16.936
Mike?

907
01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:19.176
- Sorry, buddy.
- OK.

908
01:07:26.696 --> 01:07:28.736
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.

909
01:07:33.336 --> 01:07:35.216
Great job, buddy. We lost him.

910
01:07:35.376 --> 01:07:36.536
Boo!

911
01:07:37.936 --> 01:07:39.136
No!

912
01:07:41.136 --> 01:07:43.136
Nice working with you.

913
01:07:43.216 --> 01:07:44.576
- Get it open!
- I'm trying!

914
01:07:44.656 --> 01:07:47.216
- Open the door!
- Come on, get in here.

915
01:07:56.456 --> 01:07:57.616
Boo!

916
01:08:00.896 --> 01:08:02.376
There they are!

917
01:08:06.016 --> 01:08:08.496
Sulley, what are you doing?
Sulley!

918
01:08:12.536 --> 01:08:15.296
- Looks like we caught the express.
- Do you see them?

919
01:08:15.376 --> 01:08:17.016
Straight ahead.

920
01:08:39.777 --> 01:08:41.216
- Kitty.
- Boo.

921
01:08:47.696 --> 01:08:50.976
Look at everybody's
favorite scarer now.

922
01:08:51.056 --> 01:08:54.056
You stupid, pathetic waste.

923
01:08:56.936 --> 01:09:00.976
You've been number one for too long,
Sullivan. Now your time is up.

924
01:09:01.776 --> 01:09:06.176
And don't worry.
I'll take good care of the kid.

925
01:09:06.296 --> 01:09:07.416
No!

926
01:09:28.177 --> 01:09:30.456
She's not scared of you anymore.

927
01:09:31.696 --> 01:09:33.896
Looks like you're out of a job.

928
01:09:34.897 --> 01:09:37.696
OK, over the plate.
Let's see the old stuff.

929
01:09:37.777 --> 01:09:39.616
Chuck him, baby.

930
01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:43.496
Here's the pitch and he is out of here.

931
01:09:44.217 --> 01:09:47.456
- Mama, another gator got in the house.
- Another gator?

932
01:09:47.536 --> 01:09:49.577
Give me that shovel. There!

933
01:09:50.136 --> 01:09:52.177
Get him, Mama. Get that gator.

934
01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:57.016
- Care to do the honors, Mikey?
- With pleasure.

935
01:10:06.216 --> 01:10:08.176
That's right, Boo. You did it.

936
01:10:08.256 --> 01:10:09.816
You beat him.

937
01:10:10.017 --> 01:10:11.377
Come on.

938
01:10:14.257 --> 01:10:15.656
OK, Boo, it's time to go home.

939
01:10:15.736 --> 01:10:18.576
Take care of yourself
and be a good girl, OK?

940
01:10:19.776 --> 01:10:22.416
- Oh, no.
- The power's out. Make her laugh.

941
01:10:22.497 --> 01:10:25.456
I got a move here
that'll bring down the house.

942
01:10:29.177 --> 01:10:31.296
- Sorry. She didn't see that.
- What?

943
01:10:31.377 --> 01:10:34.376
What, did you forget to check
if her hood was up, you big dope?

944
01:10:34.456 --> 01:10:37.336
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

945
01:10:37.456 --> 01:10:40.017
- You know we need her to laugh.
- Right.

946
01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:42.497
Hey, Boo. Just kidding. Look.

947
01:10:43.016 --> 01:10:44.936
Funny, right? See, with the...

948
01:10:45.016 --> 01:10:48.336
These are the jokes, kid.
What's happening?

949
01:10:49.176 --> 01:10:50.256
Hold on.

950
01:10:51.096 --> 01:10:53.696
When the door lands in the station,
cut the power.

951
01:10:53.776 --> 01:10:57.977
You'll have the child and the criminals
responsible for this whole mess.

952
01:10:59.377 --> 01:11:02.257
Great. A welcoming committee.
What are we gonna do?

953
01:11:14.297 --> 01:11:18.616
<i>This is the CDA. Come out slowly
with the child in plain sight.</i>

954
01:11:18.697 --> 01:11:21.216
OK, OK, you got us.

955
01:11:21.496 --> 01:11:23.056
Here we are. Here's the kid.

956
01:11:23.136 --> 01:11:27.217
I'll cooperate, but before you
take us away, I have one thing to say.

957
01:11:28.376 --> 01:11:30.377
<i>- Catch.
-2319.</i>

958
01:11:30.897 --> 01:11:32.896
<i>We have a toxic projectile.</i>

959
01:11:33.576 --> 01:11:36.657
<i>- After the suspect.
- Stop him!</i>

960
01:11:39.776 --> 01:11:42.137
- Come on.
- Don't let them get away.

961
01:11:44.416 --> 01:11:46.856
Wait. Come back.
He has the child.

962
01:11:52.256 --> 01:11:54.296
Sullivan. Sullivan!

963
01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:57.937
Give me the child. Give her to me!

964
01:12:06.577 --> 01:12:09.216
Open this door.
Open this door!

965
01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:16.096
Stop it.

966
01:12:16.336 --> 01:12:17.736
Don't do it.

967
01:12:19.137 --> 01:12:21.296
- Come on.
- Don't go in that room.

968
01:12:25.136 --> 01:12:27.937
I think we stopped him, Boo.
You're safe now.

969
01:12:28.016 --> 01:12:29.857
You be a good girl, OK?

970
01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:34.576
- This has gone far enough, James.
- She's home. Leave her alone.

971
01:12:34.657 --> 01:12:37.137
I can't do that. She's seen too much.

972
01:12:37.297 --> 01:12:39.816
- You both have.
- It doesn't have to be this way.

973
01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.536
I have no choice. Times have changed.

974
01:12:42.617 --> 01:12:45.537
- Scaring isn't enough anymore.
- But kidnapping?

975
01:12:45.617 --> 01:12:48.817
I'll kidnap 1,000 children
before I let the company die.

976
01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:52.057
And I'll silence anyone
who gets in my way!

977
01:12:53.417 --> 01:12:54.776
No!

978
01:12:54.857 --> 01:12:56.256
- Night, Mom.
- Night, sweetheart.

979
01:12:56.337 --> 01:12:57.817
- Night, Mom.
- What is this?

980
01:12:57.896 --> 01:13:01.377
<i>Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.</i>

981
01:13:01.817 --> 01:13:04.417
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys,

982
01:13:04.496 --> 01:13:06.816
but I spotted several big mistakes.

983
01:13:06.897 --> 01:13:08.736
But how did...

984
01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:12.097
You know what? Let's watch
my favorite part again. Shall we?

985
01:13:12.176 --> 01:13:15.297
<i>I'll kidnap 1,000 children
before I let this company die.</i>

986
01:13:15.777 --> 01:13:19.137
<i>I'll kidnap 1,000 children
before I let this company die.</i>

987
01:13:19.257 --> 01:13:22.937
<i>I'll kidnap 1,000 children
before I let this company die.</i>

988
01:13:23.577 --> 01:13:24.697
<i>- Come with us.
- What are you doing?</i>

989
01:13:24.776 --> 01:13:26.976
Take your hands off.
You can't arrest me.

990
01:13:27.057 --> 01:13:30.416
I hope you're happy, Sullivan.
You destroyed this company.

991
01:13:30.497 --> 01:13:34.617
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!
Where will everyone get their scream?

992
01:13:34.857 --> 01:13:38.776
The energy crisis will only get worse
because of you!

993
01:13:43.457 --> 01:13:45.896
<i>Stay where you are.
Number one wants to talk to you.</i>

994
01:13:46.097 --> 01:13:47.497
<i>Attention.</i>

995
01:13:54.217 --> 01:13:55.697
Hello, boys.

996
01:13:56.017 --> 01:13:57.136
- Roz?
- Roz?

997
01:13:58.337 --> 01:14:02.817
Two and a half years of
undercover work were almost wasted

998
01:14:02.896 --> 01:14:05.737
when you intercepted that child,
Mr. Sullivan.

999
01:14:06.537 --> 01:14:08.297
Of course, without your help,

1000
01:14:08.376 --> 01:14:12.457
I never would have known that
this went all the way up to Waternoose.

1001
01:14:16.257 --> 01:14:18.577
Now, about the girl.

1002
01:14:19.216 --> 01:14:21.416
I just want to send her home.

1003
01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:23.537
Very good.

1004
01:14:24.217 --> 01:14:27.017
- Bring me a door shredder.
- What? You mean...

1005
01:14:27.097 --> 01:14:29.297
You mean I can't see her again?

1006
01:14:29.697 --> 01:14:31.817
That's the way it has to be.

1007
01:14:33.257 --> 01:14:34.977
I'll give you five minutes.

1008
01:14:46.257 --> 01:14:48.657
- Well, so long, kid.
- Mike Wazowski.

1009
01:14:49.337 --> 01:14:50.417
Yeah.

1010
01:14:50.896 --> 01:14:52.017
Boo.

1011
01:14:52.097 --> 01:14:53.417
It's been fun.

1012
01:14:56.057 --> 01:14:58.137
Go ahead. Go grow up.

1013
01:15:17.457 --> 01:15:18.897
But, Boo...

1014
01:15:19.857 --> 01:15:20.937
Boo.

1015
01:15:21.697 --> 01:15:23.737
Look at that. You know...

1016
01:15:24.737 --> 01:15:26.417
That's cute. Yeah.

1017
01:15:27.737 --> 01:15:28.897
Boo...

1018
01:15:30.377 --> 01:15:32.177
Well, that's very nice.

1019
01:15:33.457 --> 01:15:35.017
Come here, you!

1020
01:15:42.657 --> 01:15:44.897
<i>Oh, he's a happy bear</i>

1021
01:15:50.737 --> 01:15:53.897
Nothing's coming out of your closet
to scare you anymore, right?

1022
01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:55.857
Yeah.

1023
01:15:57.817 --> 01:15:59.257
Goodbye, Boo.

1024
01:16:00.337 --> 01:16:01.457
Kitty.

1025
01:16:02.737 --> 01:16:04.337
Kitty has to go.

1026
01:16:43.338 --> 01:16:44.497
Boo.

1027
01:16:47.377 --> 01:16:48.537
Kitty?

1028
01:16:57.417 --> 01:17:00.338
None of this ever happened,
gentlemen.

1029
01:17:01.497 --> 01:17:05.138
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

1030
01:17:26.297 --> 01:17:27.737
<i>Take him away.</i>

1031
01:17:30.658 --> 01:17:32.737
I bet we get the rest of the day off.

1032
01:17:32.817 --> 01:17:35.858
You idiot.
They're gonna shut down the factory.

1033
01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:41.218
When that wall went up, you should
have seen Waternoose's face.

1034
01:17:41.777 --> 01:17:43.697
I hope we get a copy of that tape.

1035
01:17:43.938 --> 01:17:45.097
Are you all right?

1036
01:17:45.497 --> 01:17:47.257
Come on, pal.
Cheer up. We did it!

1037
01:17:47.337 --> 01:17:48.738
We got Boo home.

1038
01:17:48.817 --> 01:17:51.338
Sure, we put the factory
in the toilet and

1039
01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.497
hundreds of people
will be out of work.

1040
01:17:53.577 --> 01:17:56.337
Not to mention the mob that will
come after us when there's no power,

1041
01:17:56.418 --> 01:17:59.057
but at least we had some laughs, right?

1042
01:18:02.858 --> 01:18:04.057
Laughs.

1043
01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:26.257
<i>Is this thing on?
Hello? Hello? Testing.</i>

1044
01:18:26.617 --> 01:18:28.897
<i>Good evening. Nice to see you.</i>

1045
01:18:28.977 --> 01:18:31.378
<i>It's great to be here in your room.</i>

1046
01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.137
<i>Where are you from?</i>

1047
01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:37.057
<i>You're in kindergarten, right?
I love kindergarten.</i>

1048
01:18:37.138 --> 01:18:39.017
<i>Best three years of my life.</i>

1049
01:18:39.857 --> 01:18:42.658
<i>Of my life.
But I love sports.</i>

1050
01:18:42.817 --> 01:18:45.977
<i>Dodgeball was the best.
I was the fastest one out there.</i>

1051
01:18:46.058 --> 01:18:47.937
<i>Of course, I was the ball.</i>

1052
01:18:48.017 --> 01:18:50.537
<i>I was the ball, see...</i>

1053
01:18:51.057 --> 01:18:52.498
All right.

1054
01:19:06.537 --> 01:19:08.657
Thanks a lot.
I'll be here all week.

1055
01:19:08.737 --> 01:19:10.977
Remember to tip your waitresses.

1056
01:19:14.657 --> 01:19:17.697
Great job, Mikey. You filled your quota
on the first kid of the day.

1057
01:19:17.777 --> 01:19:20.738
Not bad. Only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

1058
01:19:20.817 --> 01:19:23.457
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

1059
01:19:23.577 --> 01:19:26.337
And the fact that laughter
is ten times more powerful than scream

1060
01:19:26.417 --> 01:19:27.937
had nothing to do with it?

1061
01:19:29.497 --> 01:19:31.738
Googly bear, come here, you.

1062
01:19:31.817 --> 01:19:34.058
- Schmoopsie-pooh!
- Googly.

1063
01:19:36.617 --> 01:19:39.857
Girls, stop, stop, stop.

1064
01:19:40.457 --> 01:19:42.097
Michael, you're such a charmer.

1065
01:19:42.698 --> 01:19:45.097
- Did you bring the magazine?
- A whole box.

1066
01:19:45.178 --> 01:19:46.818
Let me see it!

1067
01:19:47.058 --> 01:19:48.898
Sulley and I made the cover, right?

1068
01:19:50.338 --> 01:19:52.057
I don't believe it!

1069
01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:54.058
Googly bear.

1070
01:19:54.178 --> 01:19:57.577
I'm on the cover of a magazine!

1071
01:20:03.457 --> 01:20:05.257
This is great.

1072
01:20:31.778 --> 01:20:33.698
- Hey, Sulley.
- Hey, Mike.

1073
01:20:33.777 --> 01:20:36.298
- I was...
- There's something I want to show you.

1074
01:20:36.377 --> 01:20:38.258
Close your eyes. Follow me.

1075
01:20:38.338 --> 01:20:40.658
Come on. No peeking.

1076
01:20:41.938 --> 01:20:43.818
Keep coming, keep coming.

1077
01:20:43.897 --> 01:20:44.897
- Come on.
- Mike!

1078
01:20:44.978 --> 01:20:47.458
Follow the sultry sound of my voice.

1079
01:20:47.538 --> 01:20:48.618
OK, stop.

1080
01:20:48.697 --> 01:20:49.937
Open 'em.

1081
01:20:53.218 --> 01:20:55.898
Mike, is that...

1082
01:20:56.098 --> 01:20:57.858
Sorry it took so long, pal.

1083
01:20:57.938 --> 01:21:00.458
There was a lot of wood to go through.

1084
01:21:00.738 --> 01:21:03.338
It only works if you have every piece.

1085
01:21:30.098 --> 01:21:31.217
Boo?

1086
01:21:32.138 --> 01:21:33.378
Kitty!
